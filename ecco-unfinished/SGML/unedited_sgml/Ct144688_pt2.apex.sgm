<HEAD>BOOK V.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the Reign of King <HI>WILLIAM</HI> and Queen <HI>MARY.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_I NOW begin, on the fir&s;t day of <HI>May,</HI> 1705, to <NOTE PLACE="marg">1689 The hopes of the new reign.</NOTE> pro&s;ecute this Work; and have before me a reign, that drew upon it an univer&s;al expectation of great things to follow, from &s;uch au&s;picious be|ginnings; and from &s;o general a joy as was &s;pread over the&s;e Nations, and all the neighbouring King|doms and Stores; of whom, &s;ome had apprehended a general depre&s;&s;ion, if not the total ruine of the Prote&s;tant Religion:
<PB N="2" REF="23">
and all of them &s;aw &s;uch a progre&s;s made by the <HI>French</HI> in the de&s;ign of en&s;laving the re&s;t of <HI>Europe,</HI> that the check which the Revolution in <HI>England</HI> &s;eemed to promi&s;e, put a new life in tho&s;e, who before were &s;unk in de&s;pair. It &s;eemed to be a double-bottomed Monarchy, where there were two Joint-So|vereigns; but tho&s;e who knew the Queen's temper and prin|ciples, had no apprehen&s;ions of divided Coun&s;els, or of a di&s;|tracted Government.</P>
<P>That which gave the mo&s;t melancholy pro&s;pect, was the ill <NOTE PLACE="marg">The effects of the King's ill health.</NOTE> &s;tate of the King's health, who&s;e &s;tay &s;o long at St. <HI>James</HI>'s without exerci&s;e or hunting, which was &s;o much u&s;ed by him that it was become nece&s;&s;ary, had brought him under &s;uch a weakne&s;s, as was like to have very ill effects: And the face he forced him&s;elf to &s;et upon it, that it might not appear too much, made an impre&s;&s;ion on his temper. He was apt to be peevi&s;h: it put him under a nece&s;&s;ity of being much in his clo&s;et, and of being &s;ilent and re&s;erved; which, agreeing &s;o well with his natural di&s;po&s;ition, made him go off from what all his friends had advi&s;ed, and he had promi&s;ed them he would &s;et about, of being more vi&s;ible, open, and communicative. The Nation had been &s;o much accu&s;tomed to this, in the two former reigns, that many &s;tudied to per&s;wade him, it would be nece&s;&s;ary for his affairs to change his way, that he might be more acce&s;&s;ible, and freer in his di&s;cour&s;e. He &s;eemed re|&s;olved on it; But he &s;aid, his ill health made it impo&s;&s;ible for him to execute it: And &s;o he went on in his former way, or rather he grew more ret$span$d, and was not ea&s;ily come at, nor &s;poke to. And in a very few days, after he was &s;et on the Throne, he went out to <HI>Hampton-Court:</HI> And from that palace he came into Town only on Council days. So that the face of a Court, and the rendezvous, u&s;ual in the publick rooms, was now quite broke. This gave an early and general di&s;gu&s;t. The gaiety and the diver&s;ions of a Court di&s;appeared. And, tho' the Queen &s;et her &s;elf to make up, what was wanting in the King, by a great vivacity and chearfulne&s;s; yet when it appeared that &s;he meddled not in bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;o that few found their account in making their court to her, tho' &s;he gave a wonderful content to all that came near her, yet few came.</P>
<P>The King found the air of <HI>Hampton-Court</HI> agreed &s;o well with him, that he re&s;olved to live the greate&s;t part of the year there. But that palace was &s;o very old built, and &s;o irregular, that a de&s;ign was formed of rai&s;ing new buildings there, for the King and the Queen's Apartments. This &s;hewed a re&s;olution to live at a di&s;tance from <HI>London:</HI> And the entring &s;o &s;oon on &s;o ex|pen&s;ive
<PB N="3" REF="24">
a building, afforded matter of cen&s;ure to tho&s;e, who were di&s;po&s;ed enough to entertain it. And this &s;pread a univer&s;al di&s;content in the City of <HI>London.</HI> And the&s;e &s;mall and almo&s;t indi&s;cernable beginnings and &s;eeds of ill humour, have ever &s;ince gone on in a very vi&s;ible encrea&s;e and progre&s;s.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing the King did, was, to choo&s;e a Mini&s;try, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">A new Mi|ni&s;try.</NOTE> to &s;ettle a Council. The Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> was declared Secre|tary of State, and had the greate&s;t &s;hare of the King's Confidence. No exception could be made to the choice, except on account of his youth. But he applied him&s;elf to bu&s;ine&s;s with great di|ligence, and maintained his candor and temper with more re|&s;ervedne&s;s, than was expected from one of his age. It was for &s;ome time under con&s;ideration, who &s;hould be the other Secre|tary; at la&s;t the Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI> was pitched on. He had oppo&s;ed the Settlement with great earne&s;tne&s;s, in his copious way of &s;peaking. But he had always &s;aid, that, tho' he would not make a King, yet upon his principles, he could obey him bet|ter than tho&s;e who were &s;o much &s;et on making one. The High Church Party did apprehend, that the oppo&s;ition they had given the King's advancement, and the zeal that <HI>others</HI> had &s;hewed for it, would alienate him from <HI>them,</HI> and throw him into <HI>other</HI> hands, from whom no good was to be expected for them: And they looked for &s;evere revenges for the hard&s;hips they had put on <HI>the&s;e</HI> in the end of King <HI>Charles</HI>'s Reign. This grew daily upon that party, and made them begin to look back toward King <HI>James.</HI> So, not to provoke &s;o great a Body too much, it was thought advi&s;able to employ the Earl of <HI>Not|tingham.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earl of <HI>Notting|ham</HI>'s ad|vancement unacceptable to the Whigs.</NOTE> The great increa&s;e of Chancery bu&s;ine&s;s had made many apprehend, it was too much to be tru&s;ted to one per&s;on: So it was re&s;olved to put the Chancery in Commi&s;&s;ion: And the Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI> was propo&s;ed to be the fir&s;t in the Commi&s;&s;ion, but he refu&s;ed it. So <HI>Maynard, Keck,</HI> and <HI>Raw|lin&s;on,</HI> three eminent Lawyers, were made the three Commi&s;|&s;ioners of the Great Seal. And &s;oon after that, the Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI> was appointed Secretary of State. This gave as much &s;atisfaction to all the High Party, as it begot jealou&s;ies and di&s;tru&s;t in <HI>others.</HI> The one hoped for protection and favour by his means: They reckoned, he would infu&s;e all the Prero|gative Notions into the King; and give him &s;uch a jealou&s;y of every &s;tep that the <HI>others</HI> &s;hould make in prejudice of the&s;e, that from thence the King would &s;ee cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect all the &s;hew of kindne&s;s that <HI>they</HI> might put on to him, when at the &s;ame time <HI>they</HI> were undermining &s;ome of tho&s;e Preroga|tives, for which the Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI> &s;eemed to be &s;o zea|lous.
<PB N="4" REF="25">
This had a great effect on the King, who being igno|rant of our Con&s;titution, and naturally cautious, &s;aw cau&s;e enough to di&s;like the heat he found among <HI>tho&s;e,</HI> who expre&s;|&s;ed much zeal for him, but who &s;eemed, at the &s;ame time, to have with it a great mixture of Republican principles. <HI>They,</HI> on the other hand, were much offended at the employing the Earl of <HI>Nottingham.</HI> And he gave them daily cau&s;e to be more di&s;plea&s;ed at it: For he &s;et him&s;elf with a mo&s;t eager partiality again&s;t the whole Party, and again&s;t all the motions made by them: And he &s;tudied to po&s;&s;e&s;s the King with a very bad opinion of them. And, whereas Secretaries of State have a particular allowance for &s;uch Spies, as they employ to procure intelligence, how exact &s;oever he might be in procur|ing Foreign intelligence, he &s;pared no co&s;t nor pains to have an account of all that pa&s;&s;ed in the City, and in other angry cabals: And he furni&s;hed the King very copiou&s;ly that way; which made a deep impre&s;&s;ion on him, and had very bad effects. The Earl of <HI>Danby</HI> was made Marqui&s;s of <HI>Carmar|then,</HI> and Pre&s;ident of the Council: and Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> had the Privy Seal. The la&s;t of the&s;e had gone into all the &s;teps, that had been made for the King, with great zeal, and by that means was hated by the High Parcy, whom for di&s;tinction &s;ake I will hereafter call TORIES, and the other WHIGS: Terms that I have &s;poken much again&s;t, and have ever hated: But to avoid making always a longer de&s;cription, I mu&s;t u&s;e them; they being now become as common as if they had been words of our Language. Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> &s;oon &s;aw that his friend&s;hip with the Whigs was not like to la&s;t long: His op|po&s;ing the Exclu&s;ion &s;tuck &s;till deep with them: And the bu&s;ine&s;s of the <HI>Quo Warranto's,</HI> and the delivering up of Charters, was ca&s;t on him: The &s;lowne&s;s of relieving <HI>Ireland</HI> was al&s;o charged on him; He had for &s;ome time great credit with the King; tho' his Mercurial Wit was not well &s;uited with the King's Phlegm. Lord <HI>Carmarthen</HI> could not bear the equality, or rather the preference that &s;eemed to be given to Lord <HI>Halifax:</HI> And therefore &s;et on the &s;torm, that quickly broke out upon him.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Mordaunt</HI> was made Earl of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> and fir&s;t Commi&s;&s;ioner of the Trea&s;ury: And Lord <HI>De la Mere,</HI> made Earl of <HI>Warrington,</HI> was Chancellor of the Exchequer: Lord <HI>Godolphin</HI> was likewi&s;e brought into the Trea&s;ury, to the great grief of the other Two; who &s;oon &s;aw, that the King con&s;i|dered him more than them both. For, as he under&s;tood Trea&s;ury bu&s;ine&s;s well, &s;o his calm and cold way &s;uited the
<PB N="5" REF="26">
King's temper. The Earls of <HI>Monmouth</HI> and <HI>Warrington,</HI> tho' both mo&s;t violent Whigs, became great enemies: The former was generous, and gave the inferior places freely; but &s;ought out the men, who were mo&s;t noted for Republican Principles, for them all: And the other, they &s;aid, &s;old every thing that was in his Power. The Privy Council was compo&s;ed chiefly of Whigs.</P>
<P>Nothing gave a more general &s;atisfaction than the naming of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Judges well cho&s;en.</NOTE> the Judges; the King ordered every Privy Coun&s;ellor, to bring a li&s;t of twelve: And out of the&s;e, twelve very learned and wor|thy Judges were cho&s;en. This nomination was generally well received over the Nation. The fir&s;t of the&s;e was Sir <HI>John Holt,</HI> made Lord Chief Ju&s;tice of <HI>England,</HI> then a young man for &s;o high a po&s;t, who maintained it all his time with a high reputation for capacity, integrity, courage, and great di&s;patch. So that &s;ince the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Hale</HI>'s time, that Bench has not been &s;o well filled, as it was by him.</P>
<P>The King's chief per&s;onal favour, lay between <HI>Benthinck</HI> and <HI>Sidney:</HI> The former was made Earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> and Groom of the Stole, and continued for ten years to be entirely tru&s;ted by the King; and &s;erved him with great fidelity and ob&s;equiou&s;|ne&s;s: But he could never bring him&s;elf to be acceptable to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation. The other was made fir&s;t, Lord <HI>Sidney,</HI> and then Earl of <HI>Rumney:</HI> And was put in &s;everal great po&s;ts. He was made Secretary of State, Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and Ma&s;ter of the Ordnance: But he was &s;o &s;et on plea&s;ure, that he was not able to follow bu&s;ine&s;s with a due application. The Earls of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Dor&s;et</HI> had the White Staffs: The fir&s;t was Lord Steward, and the other was Lord Chamberlain: And they being both Whigs, the hou&s;hold was made up of &s;uch, ex|cept where there were buyers for places, which were &s;et to &s;ale: And tho' the King &s;eemed to di&s;courage that, yet he did not en|courage propo&s;itions, that were made for the detecting tho&s;e prac|tices. Thus was the Court, the Mini&s;try, and the Council com|po&s;ed. The Admiralty was put in Commi&s;&s;ion: And <HI>Herbert</HI> made Earl of <HI>Torrington,</HI> was fir&s;t in the Commi&s;&s;ion. He tried to dictate to the Board: And, when he found that did not pa&s;s upon them, he left it; and &s;tudied all he could to di&s;parage their conduct: And it was thought, he hoped to have been advanced to that high Tru&s;t alone.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing propo&s;ed to be done, was to turn the Con|vention <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Con|vention turn|ed to a Par+liament.</NOTE> into a Parliament, according to the precedent &s;et in the year 1660. This was oppo&s;ed by all the Tories. They &s;aid, Writs were indi&s;pen&s;ible to the being of a Parliament. And,
<PB N="6" REF="27">
tho' the like was done at the Re&s;toration, yet it was &s;aid, that the Convention was then called, when there was no King nor Great Seal in <HI>England:</HI> And it was called by the con&s;ent of the lawful King, and was done upon a true and vi&s;ible, and not on a pretended nece&s;&s;ity: And they added that, after all, even then the Convention was not looked on as a legal Parlia|ment: Its acts were ratified in a &s;ub&s;equent Parliament; and from thence they had their Authority. So it was moved, that the Convention &s;hould be di&s;&s;olved, and a new Parliament &s;um|moned: For in the joy which accompanied the Revolution, men well-affected to it were generally cho&s;en: And it was thought, that the damp, which was now &s;pread into many parts of the Na|tion, would occa&s;ion great changes in a new election. On the other hand, the nece&s;&s;ity of affairs was &s;o pre&s;&s;ing, that no time was to be lo&s;t: A delay of forty days might be the total lo&s;s of <HI>Ireland;</HI> and &s;top all our preparations at Sea: Nor was it advi&s;eable, in &s;o critical a time, to put the Nation into the fer|ment, which a new election would occa&s;ion. And it was rea&s;on|able to expect, that tho&s;e who had &s;et the King on the Throne, would be more zealous to maintain him there, than any new &s;et of men could po&s;&s;ibly be: And tho&s;e who &s;ubmitted to a King, <HI>de facto,</HI> mu&s;t likewi&s;e &s;ubmit to a Parliament, <HI>de facto.</HI> So the Bill pa&s;t: And a day was &s;et for the call of both Hou&s;es, and for requiring the Members to take the Oaths.</P>
<P>Eight Bi&s;hops ab&s;ented them&s;elves, who were <HI>Sancroft</HI> of <HI>Can|terbury, Thomas</HI> of <HI>Worce&s;ter, Lake</HI> of <HI>Chiche&s;ter, Turner</HI> of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Some Bi|&s;hops leave the Parlia|ment.</NOTE> <HI>Ely, Lloyd</HI> of <HI>Norwich, Ken</HI> of <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Wells, Frampton</HI> of <HI>Gloce&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>White</HI> of <HI>Peterborough.</HI> But in the mean while, that they might recommend them&s;elves by a &s;hew of Modera|tion, &s;ome of them moved the Hou&s;e of Lords, before they withdrew from it, for a bill of Toleration, and another of Com|prehen&s;ion: And the&s;e were drawn and offered by the Earl of <HI>Nottingham:</HI> And, as he &s;aid to me, they were the &s;ame that he had prepared for the Hou&s;e of Commons in King <HI>Charles</HI>'s time, during the Debates of the Exclu&s;ion: But then things of that kind were looked on as artifices, to lay the heat of that time, and to render the Church Party more popular. After tho&s;e motions were made, the Bi&s;hops that were in the Hou&s;e withdrew: <HI>Sancroft, Thomas,</HI> and <HI>Lake,</HI> never came: The two la&s;t died &s;oon after. <HI>Ken,</HI> was a man of a warm imagination: And at the time of the King's fir&s;t landing, he declared heartily for him, and advi&s;ed all the Gentlemen, that he &s;aw, to go and join with him. But during the Debates in the Convention, he went with great heat into the notion of a Prince Regent. And now,
<PB N="7" REF="28">
upon the call of the Hou&s;e, he withdrew into his Dioce&s;e. He changed his mind again, and wrote a paper, per&s;wading the Clergy to take the Oaths, which he &s;hewed to Dr. <HI>Whitby,</HI> who read it, as the Dr. has told me often. His Chaplain, Dr. <HI>Eyre,</HI> did al&s;o tell me, that he came with him to <HI>London,</HI> where at fir&s;t he owned he was re&s;olved to go to the Hou&s;e of Lords, and to take the Oaths. But the fir&s;t day after he came to Town, he was prevailed on to change his mind: And he has continued ever &s;ince in a very warm oppo&s;ition to the Government. <HI>San|croft</HI> went on in his unactive &s;tate, &s;till refu&s;ing the Oaths, but neither acting nor &s;peaking, except in great confidence, to any again&s;t their taking them. The&s;e Bi&s;hops did one thing very incon&s;i&s;tent with their other actions, and that could not be ea&s;ily reconciled to the rules of good con&s;cience. All pre&s;entations are directed to Bi&s;hops, or to their Chancellors. But, by a general agreement in the year 1660, the Bi&s;hops re&s;olved to except out of the Patents, that they gave their Chancellors, the power of giving In&s;titution into Cures, which before that, the Chancellors were impowered to give in the Bi&s;hops ab&s;ence. Now the Bi|&s;hops were bound to &s;ee that the Clergy, before they gave them In&s;titution, took the Oaths to the Government. In order there|fore to decline the doing this, and yet avoid the actions of <HI>Quare Impedit,</HI> that they would be liable to, if they did not admit the Clerks pre&s;ented to them, they gave new Patents to their Chan|cellors, empowering them to give In&s;titution; which they knew could not be done, but by tendring the Oaths. So they gave authority to Lay-men, to admit men to Benefices, and to do that which they thought unlawful, as was the &s;wearing to an U&s;urper again&s;t the lawful King. Thus it appeared, how far the Engage|ment of intere&s;t and parties can run men into contradictions.</P>
<P>Upon the Bi&s;hops refu&s;ing the Oaths, a Bill was brought into the Hou&s;e of Commons, requiring all per&s;ons to take them by a prefixed day, under &s;everal forfeitures and penalties. The Clergy that took them not, were to fall under &s;u&s;pen&s;ion for &s;ix months, and at the end of tho&s;e, they were to be deprived. This was followed with a particular eagerne&s;s by &s;ome, who were known enemies to the Church: And it was then generally be|lieved, that a great part of the Clergy would refu&s;e the Oaths. So they hoped to have an advantage again&s;t the Church by this means. <HI>Hambden</HI> per&s;waded the King, to add a period to a Speech he made, concerning the Affairs of <HI>Ireland,</HI> in which he propo&s;ed the admitting all Prote&s;tants to &s;erve in that War. This was under&s;tood, to be intended, for taking off the Sacramental Te&s;t, which was nece&s;&s;ary by the Law, to qualify men for em|ployments,
<PB N="8" REF="29">
and was looked on, as the chief &s;ecurity the Church of <HI>England</HI> had, as it excluded Di&s;&s;enters from all employments. And it was tried, if a bargain could be made, for excu&s;ing the Clergy from the Oaths, provided the Di&s;&s;enters might be excu&s;ed from the Sacrament. The King put this into his Speech, with|out communicating it to the Mini&s;try: And it had a very ill ef|fect. It was not only rejected by a great majority in both Hou&s;es; but it very much heightened the prejudices again&s;t the King, as bearing no great affection to the Church of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> when he propo&s;ed the opening &s;uch a door, which they believed would be fatal to them. The rejecting this, made the act impo&s;ing the Oaths to be driven on with the more zeal. This <NOTE PLACE="marg">I was made Bi&s;hop of <HI>Salisbury.</HI></NOTE> was in debate, when I came into the Hou&s;e of Lords: For <HI>Ward,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> died this Winter: Many &s;poke to the King in my favour, without my knowledge. The King made them no an&s;wer. But a few days after he was &s;et on the Throne, he of his own motion named me to that See: And he did it in terms more obliging, than u&s;ually fell from him. When I waited on the Queen, &s;he &s;aid, &s;he hoped I would now put in practice tho&s;e notions, with which I had taken the liberty often to entertain her. All the forms of the <HI>cong&egrave; d&eacute;lire,</HI> and my Election, were carried on with di&s;patch. But a great difficulty was in view. <HI>Sancroft</HI> would not &s;ee me; and he refu&s;ed to con&s;ecrate me. So by Law, when the Mandate was brought to him, upon not obeying it, he mu&s;t have been &s;ued in a <HI>Pre|munire:</HI> And for &s;ome Days, he &s;eemed determined to venture that: But as the danger came near, he prevented it, by granting a Commi&s;&s;ion to all the Bi&s;hops of his Province, or to any three of them, in Conjunction with the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> to exerci&s;e his Metropolitical authority during plea&s;ure. Thus he did au|thori&s;e others to con&s;ecrate me, while yet he &s;eemed to think it an unlawful Act. This was &s;o mean, that he him&s;elf was a&s;ham|ed of it afterwards. But he took an odd way to overthrow it: For he &s;ent for his original Warrant: And &s;o took it out of the Office, and got it into his own hands.</P>
<P>I happened to come into the Hou&s;e of Lords, when two great debates were managed with much heat in it. The one was about the Toleration and Comprehen&s;ion, and the other was about the Impo&s;ing the Oaths on the Clergy. And I was engaged at my fir&s;t coming there, to bear a large &s;hare in both.</P>
<P>That which was long in&s;i&s;ted on, in the Hou&s;e of Lords, was, that in&s;tead of the clau&s;e po&s;itively enacting, that the Clergy <NOTE PLACE="marg">Debates con|cerning the Oaths.</NOTE> &s;hould be obliged to take the Oaths, the King might be im|powered to tender them, and then the refu&s;al was to be pu|ni&s;hed
<PB N="9" REF="30">
according to the Clau&s;e, as it &s;tood in the Act. It was thought, &s;uch a power would oblige them to their good beha|viour, and be an effectual re&s;traint upon them: They would be kept quiet at lea&s;t by it: Whereas, if they came under Depriva|tion, or the apprehen&s;ions of it, that would make them de&s;|perate, and &s;et them on to undermine the Government. It was &s;aid, that the Clergy, by the Offices of the Church, did &s;olemnly own their Allegiance to God, in the &s;ight of all their people; that no Oath could lay deeper Engagements on them, than tho&s;e Acts of religious Wor&s;hip did: And if they &s;hould either pa&s;s over tho&s;e Offices, or perform them, otherwi&s;e than as the Law required, there was a clear method, pur&s;uant to the Act of Uniformity, to proceed &s;everely again&s;t them. It was al&s;o &s;aid, that in many different changes of Government, Oaths had not proved &s;o effectual a &s;ecurity as was imagined: Di&s;|tinctions were found out, and &s;en&s;es were put on words, by which they were interpreted &s;o, as to &s;ignify but little, when a Government came to need &s;trength from them: And it ill became tho&s;e, who had formerly complained of the&s;e impo&s;i|tions, to urge this with &s;o much vehemence. On the other hand, it was urged, that no man ought to be tru&s;ted by a Go|vernment, chiefly in &s;o &s;acred a concern, who would not give &s;ecurity to it; e&s;pecially, &s;ince the Oath was brought to &s;uch low and general terms. The Expedient that was propo&s;ed, would put a hard&s;hip upon the King, which was always to be carefully avoided. The day prefixed was at the di&s;tance of &s;ome months: So that men had time &s;ufficient given them to &s;tudy the point: And, if in that time they could not &s;atisfy them&s;elves, as to the lawfulne&s;s of acknowledging the Govern|ment, it was not fit that they &s;hould continue in the highe&s;t Po&s;ts of the Church. An exception of Twelve was propo&s;ed, who &s;hould be &s;ubject to the Law, upon refu&s;ing the Oaths, when required to it by the King; but that was rejected: And all the mitigation that was obtained, was a power to the King, to re&s;erve a third part of the profits of any twelve Benefices he &s;hould name, to the Incumbents who &s;hould be deprived by virtue of this Act: And &s;o it pa&s;&s;ed. I was the chief Manager of the Debate, in favour of the Clergy; both in the Hou&s;e of Lords, and at the Conferences with the Commons. But, &s;eeing it could not be carried, I acquie&s;ced the more ea|&s;ily; becau&s;e, tho' in the beginning of the&s;e Debates I was a&s;|&s;ured, that tho&s;e who &s;eemed re&s;olved not to take the Oaths, yet prayed for the King in their Chapels; yet I found after|wards this was not true, for they named no King nor Queen,
<PB N="10" REF="31">
and &s;o it was ea&s;y to gue&s;s, whom they meant by &s;uch an in|definite de&s;ignation. I al&s;o heard many things, that made me conclude, they were endeavouring to rai&s;e all the Oppo&s;ition to the Government po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The Bill of Toleration pa&s;&s;ed ea&s;ily. It excu&s;ed Di&s;&s;enters <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Act of Toleration.</NOTE> from all penalties, for their not coming to Church, and for going to their &s;eparate Meetings. There was an exception of <HI>Socinians:</HI> But a provi&s;ion was put in it, in favour of <HI>Qua|kers:</HI> And, tho' the re&s;t were required to take the Oaths to the Government, They were excu&s;ed, upon making in lieu thereof a &s;olemn Declaration. They were to take out War|rants for the Hou&s;es they met in: And the Ju&s;tices of Peace were required to grant them. Some propo&s;ed, that the Act &s;hould only be temporary, as a nece&s;&s;ary re&s;traint upon the Di&s;&s;enters, that they might demean them&s;elves, &s;o as to merit the continuance of it, when the term of years now of|fered &s;hould end. But this was rejected: There was now an univer&s;al inclination to pa&s;s the Act: But it could not be ex|pected, that the Nation would be in the &s;ame good di&s;po&s;ition towards them at another time. I &s;hewed &s;o much zeal for this Act, as very much &s;unk my credit, which had ri&s;en from the approbation I had gained, for oppo&s;ing That which enacted the taking the Oaths. As for the Act of Comprehen&s;ion, &s;ome progre&s;s was made in it. But a Provi&s;o was offered, that, in imitation of the Acts pa&s;&s;ed in King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth and <NOTE PLACE="marg">A motion for a Com|prehen&s;ion.</NOTE> King <HI>Edward</HI> the Sixth's time, a number of per&s;ons, both of the Clergy and Laity, might be empowered to prepare &s;uch a Reformation of things, relating to the Church, as might be offered to King and Parliament, in order to the healing our Divi&s;ions, and the correcting what might be ami&s;s or defective in our Con&s;titution. This was pre&s;&s;ed with great earne&s;tne&s;s by many of the temporal Lords. I at that time did imagine, that the Clergy would have come into &s;uch a de&s;ign with zeal and unanimity: And I feared this would be looked on by them, as taking the matter out of their hands: And for that rea&s;on I argued &s;o warmly again&s;t this, that it was carried by a &s;mall Majority to let it fall. But I was convinced &s;oon after, that I had taken wrong mea&s;ures; and that the method propo&s;ed by the&s;e Lords, was the only one like to prove effec|tual: But this did not &s;o recommend me to the Clergy, as to balance the cen&s;ure I came under, for moving, in another Pro|vi&s;o of that Bill, that the Sub&s;cription, in&s;tead of <HI>A&s;&s;ent</HI> and <HI>Con&s;ent,</HI> &s;hould only be to <HI>&s;ubmit</HI> with a promi&s;e of Conformity. There was a Provi&s;o likewi&s;e, in the Bill, for di&s;pen&s;ing with
<PB N="11" REF="32">
kneeling at the Sacrament, and being Baptized with the Sign of the Cro&s;s, to &s;uch as, after conference upon tho&s;e heads, &s;hould &s;olemnly prote&s;t, they were not &s;atisfied as to the law|fulne&s;s of them. That concerning kneeling, occa&s;ion'd a ve|hement Debate: For, the Po&s;ture being the chief exception that the Di&s;&s;enters had, the giving up this was thought to be the opening a way for them to come into Employments. Yet it was carried in the Hou&s;e of Lords. And I declared my &s;elf zealous for it. For &s;ince, it was acknowledged, that the Po&s;|ture was not e&s;&s;ential in it&s;elf, and that Scriples, how ill grounded &s;oever, were rai&s;ed upon it, it &s;eemed rea&s;onable to leave the matter as indifferent in its practice, as it was in its nature.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who had moved for this Bill, and afterwards brought it into the Hou&s;e, acted a very di&s;ingenuous part: For, while they &s;tudied to recommend them&s;elves by this &s;hew of Mode|ration, they &s;et on their Friends to oppo&s;e it: And &s;uch as were very &s;incerely and cordially for it, were repre&s;ented as the Ene|mies of the Church, who intended to &s;ubvert it. When the Bill was &s;ent down to the Hou&s;e of Commons, it was let lie on the Table. And, in&s;tead of proceeding in it, they made an Ad|dre&s;s to the King, for fummoning a Convocation of the Clergy to attend, according to cu&s;tom, on the Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament. The Party, that was now beginning to be formed again&s;t the Go|vernment, pretended great zeal for the Church; and declared their apprehen&s;ions that it was in danger, which was imputed by many to the Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI>'s management. The&s;e, as they went heavily into the Toleration, &s;o they were much of|fended with the Bill of Comprehen&s;ion, as containing matters relating to the Church, in which the Repre&s;entative Body of the Clergy had not been &s;o much as advi&s;ed with.</P>
<P>Nor was this Bill &s;upported by tho&s;e, who &s;eemed mo&s;t &s;a|vourable to the Di&s;&s;enters: They &s;et it up for a maxim, that it was fit to keep up a &s;trong faction both in Church and State; And they thought it was not agreeable to that, to &s;uffer &s;o great a body as the Presbyterians to be made more ea&s;y, or more inclinable to unite to the Church: They al&s;o thought, that the Toleration would be be&s;t maintained, when great numbers &s;hould need it, and be concerned to pre&s;erve it: So this good De&s;ign being zealou&s;ly oppo&s;ed, and but faintly pro|moted, it fell to the ground.</P>
<P>The Clergy began now to &s;hew an implacable hatred to the <NOTE PLACE="marg">An ill hu+mour &s;pred among the Clergy.</NOTE> Nonconformi&s;ts, and &s;eemed to wi&s;h for an occa&s;ion to renew old Severities again&s;t them. But wi&s;e and good men did very
<PB N="12" REF="33">
much applaud the quieting the Nation by the Toleration. It &s;eemed to be &s;uitable, both to the Spirit of the Chri&s;tian Reli|gion, and to the Intere&s;t of the Nation. It was thought very unrea&s;onable, that, while we were complaining of the Cruelty of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> we &s;hould fall into &s;uch practices among our &s;elves; chiefly, while we were engaging in a war, in the progre&s;s of which we would need the united &s;trength of the whole Nation.</P>
<P>This Bill gave the King great content. He is his own opinion always thought, that Con&s;cience was God's Province, and that it ought not to be impo&s;ed on: And his experience in <HI>Hol|land</HI> made him look on Toleration, as one of the wi&s;e&s;t mea|&s;ures of Government: He was much troubled to &s;ee &s;o much ill humour &s;preading among the Clergy, and by their means over a great part of the Nation. He was &s;o true to his Principle herein, that he re&s;trained the heat of &s;ome, who were propo&s;ing &s;evere Acts again&s;t Papi&s;ts. He made them apprehend the ad|vantage, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Great gen|tlene&s;s to|wards Pa|pi&s;ts.</NOTE> which that would give the <HI>French,</HI> to alienate all the Papi&s;ts of <HI>Europe</HI> from us; who from thence might hope to &s;et on foot a new Catholick League, and make the War a quarrel of Religion; which might have very bad effects. Nor could he pretend to protect the Prote&s;tants in many places of <HI>Germany,</HI> and in <HI>Hungary,</HI> unle&s;s he could cover the Papi&s;ts in <HI>England,</HI> from all Severities on the account of their Religion. This was &s;o carefully infu&s;ed into many, and &s;o well under|&s;tood by them, that the Papi&s;ts have enjoy'd the real effects of the Toleration, tho' they were not comprehended within the Statute that enacted it.</P>
<P>While dome&s;tick matters were rai&s;ing great heats at home, <NOTE PLACE="marg">War pro|claimed again&s;t <HI>France.</HI></NOTE> we &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of making vigorous Preparations for the War abroad, and in <HI>Ireland.</HI> The King laid before both Hou&s;es the Alliances, formerly made by the Crown of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> with the States, and with the Empire, together with the new ones that were now propo&s;ed, which made a Rupture with <HI>France</HI> nece&s;&s;ary. So, by the Advices of both Hou&s;es, War was declared again&s;t <HI>France:</HI> And the nece&s;&s;ary Supplies, both for the <HI>Quota</HI> that the King was to furni&s;h, and for the Reduction of <HI>Ireland,</HI> were provided.</P>
<P>The next care was a Revenue, for the Support of the Go|vernment. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Debates concerning the Revenue.</NOTE> By a long cour&s;e, and the practice of &s;ome Ages, the Cu&s;toms had been granted to our Kings for life: So the King expected, that the like regard &s;hould be &s;hewn for him. But mens minds were much divided in that matter. Some Whigs, who by a long Oppo&s;ition, and jealou&s;y of the Go|vernment,

had wrought them&s;elves into &s;uch Republican Prin|ciples, that they could not ea&s;ily come off from them, &s;et it up as a maxim not to grant any Revenue, but from year to year, or at mo&s;t, for a &s;hort term of years. This, they thought, would render the Crown precarious, and oblige our Kings to &s;uch a popular method of Government, as &s;hould merit the con&s;tant Renewal of that Grant. And they hoped, that &s;o uncertain a Tenure, might more ea&s;ily bring about an entire change of Government. For, by the denying the Revenue at any time (except upon intolerable conditions) they thought That might be ea&s;ily effected, &s;ince it would render our Kings &s;o feeble, that they would not be able to maintain their Autho|rity. The Tories ob&s;erving this, made great u&s;e of it, to be|get in the King jealou&s;ies of his Friends, with too much co|lour, and too great &s;ucce&s;s. They re&s;olved to reconcile them|&s;elves to the King by granting it, but at pre&s;ent only to look on, till the Whigs, who now carried every thing, to which they &s;et their full &s;trength, &s;hould have refu&s;ed it.</P>
<P>The King, as he had come through the We&s;tern Countries, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chim|ney money di&s;charged.</NOTE> from his fir&s;t Landing, had been in many places moved to di&s;charge the Chimney money: And had promi&s;ed to recom|mend it to the Parliament. He had done that &s;o effectually, that an Act pa&s;t di&s;charging it; tho' it was &s;o much oppo&s;ed by the Tories, that it ran a great hazard in the Hou&s;e of Lords. Tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed it, pretended, that it was the on|ly &s;ure Fund, that could never fail in War, &s;o that Money would be freely advanced upon it: They &s;aid, a few regu|lations would take away any grievance, that might ari&s;e from it: But it was thought, they were not willing that &s;uch an Act &s;hould pa&s;s, as would render the King acceptable to the Body of the Nation. It was al&s;o thought, that the pro&s;pect they then had of a &s;peedy Revolution, in favour of King <HI>James,</HI> made &s;ome of them unwilling to pa&s;s an Act, that &s;eemed to lay an obligation on him, either to maintain it, or by re&s;um|ing his Revenue, to rai&s;e the hatred of the Nation higher again&s;t him. When the &s;ettling the King's Revenue was brought under Con&s;ideration, it was found, there were anticipations and charges upon it, from which it &s;eemed rea&s;onable to clear it. So many Per&s;ons were concerned in this, and the Sea&s;on of the year was &s;o far advanced, that it was pretended, they had not time to examine that matter with due care: And there|fore, by a Provi&s;ional Act, they granted the King the Revenue for one year: And many intended never to carry the Grant but from year to year. This touched the King very &s;en&s;ibly.
<PB N="14" REF="35">
And many di&s;cour&s;es, that pa&s;t among &s;our Whigs in their Cabals, were communicated to him by the Earl of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> by which he concluded, he was in the Hand of Per&s;ons, that did not intend to u&s;e him well.</P>
<P>A Bill was prepared, concerning the Militia, which upon the <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Bill con|cerning the Militia.</NOTE> matter, and in con&s;equence of many clau&s;es in it, took it in a great mea&s;ure both from the Crown, and out of the Lords Lieutenants; who being generally Peers, a Bill that le&s;|&s;ened their authority &s;o much, was not like to pa&s;s in the Hou&s;e of Lords: So it was let lie on the Table. By this like|wi&s;e, which was chiefly promoted by the Whigs; the King came to think, that tho&s;e who had rai&s;ed him to the Throne, intended to depre&s;s his Prerogative, as much as they had ex|alted his Per&s;on. He &s;eemed to grow tender and jealous up|on the&s;e points, the importance of every one of them being much aggravated by the Earl of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> who had fur|ni&s;hed him with a &s;cheme of all the points of the Prerogative, and of their dependance one upon another: And he &s;eemed &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with this, that many of tho&s;e who had formerly mo&s;t of his confidence, found a coldne&s;s growing upon him, which increa&s;ed their di&s;gu&s;t, and made them apprehend, they &s;hould again &s;ee a Reign full of Prerogative maxims. One thing the Hou&s;e of Commons granted, which was very acceptable to the King: They gave the States about <HI>600000l.</HI> for the charge they had been at in the Fleet and Army, which they furni&s;hed the King with at the Revolution.</P>
<P>They could not be brought to another point, tho' often and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Debates con|cerning an Act of In|demnity.</NOTE> much pre&s;&s;ed to it by the King. He thought nothing would &s;ettle the minds of the Nation &s;o much as an Act of Indem|nity, with proper exceptions of &s;ome Criminals, that &s;hould be left to Ju&s;tice. <HI>Jefferies</HI> was in the Tower; <HI>Wright,</HI> who had been Lord Chief Ju&s;tice, and &s;ome of the Judges, were in Newgate; <HI>Graham</HI> and <HI>Burton,</HI> who had been the wicked Solicitors in the former Reigns, were in Pri&s;on; but the hotte&s;t of the Whigs would not &s;et this on. They thought it be&s;t to keep many under the la&s;h; they intended &s;evere revenges for the Blood that had been &s;hed, and for the many unju&s;t things that had been done in the end of King <HI>Charles</HI>'s Reign; they &s;aw, that the clogging the Indemnity, with many compre|hen&s;ive Exceptions, would create King <HI>James</HI> a great Party; &s;o they did not think it proper to offer at that: Yet they re&s;olved to keep them &s;till in their power, till a better opportunity for falling on them &s;hould offer it&s;elf: Therefore they proceeded &s;o &s;lowly in that matter, that the Bill could
<PB N="15" REF="36">
not be brought to a ripene&s;s during this Se&s;&s;ion. It is true, the great mildne&s;s of the King's temper, and the gentlene&s;s of his Government, which was indeed rather liable to cen&s;ure, as being too remi&s;s, &s;et peoples minds much at ea&s;e: And, if it gave too much boldne&s;s to tho&s;e, who began to &s;et up an open oppo&s;ition to him, yet it gained upon the greater part of the Nation, who &s;aw none of tho&s;e moving &s;pectacles, that had been &s;o common in former Reigns: And all promi&s;ed them&s;elves happy days, under &s;o merciful a Prince. But angry men put a wick|ed con&s;truction on the earne&s;tne&s;s the King &s;hewed for an Act of Indemnity; They &s;aid, he intended to make u&s;e of a &s;et of Prerogative men, as &s;oon as legally he could; And therefore he de&s;ired the In&s;truments of King <HI>James</HI>'s illegal Government might be once &s;ecured, that &s;o he might employ them. The Earls of <HI>Monmouth</HI> and <HI>Warrington</HI> were infu&s;ing jealou&s;ies of the King into their party, with the &s;ame Indu&s;try that the Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI> was, at the &s;ame time, in&s;tilling into the King jealou&s;ies of them: And both acted with too much &s;ucce&s;s; which put matters much out of joint. For tho' the Earls of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> and <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> did all they could, to &s;top the pro|gre&s;s and effects of tho&s;e &s;u&s;picions, with which the Whigs were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, yet they had not credit enough to do it. The Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> tho' he had more of the King's favour, yet he had not &s;trength to re&s;i&s;t the Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI>'s pompous and tragical Declamations.</P>
<P>There was a Bill of great importance &s;ent up by the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bill of Rights.</NOTE> Commons to the Lords, that was not fini&s;hed this Se&s;&s;ion. It was a Bill, declaring the Rights and Liberties of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and the Succe&s;&s;ion to the Crown, as had been agreed by both Hou&s;es of Parliament, to the King and Queen and their I&s;&s;ue, and after them, to the Prince&s;s <HI>Anne</HI> and her I&s;&s;ue, and after the&s;e, to the King and his I&s;&s;ue. A Clau&s;e was in&s;ert|ed, di&s;abling all Papi&s;ts from &s;ucceeding to the Crown, to which the Lords added, <HI>or &s;uch as &s;hould marry Papi&s;ts.</HI> To this I propo&s;ed an additional Clau&s;e, ab&s;olving the Subjects, in that ca&s;e, from their Allegiance. This was &s;econded by the Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury:</HI> And it pa&s;&s;ed without any oppo&s;ition, or debate: which amazed us all, con&s;idering the importance of it. But the King ordered me to propo&s;e the naming the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Hanover,</HI> and her Po&s;terity, next in the Succe&s;&s;ion. He &s;ignified his plea&s;ure in this al&s;o to the Mini&s;ters. But he ordered me to begin the Motion in the Hou&s;e, becau&s;e I had already &s;et it on foot. And the Duke of <HI>Hanover</HI> had now other thoughts of the matter, and was &s;eparating him&s;elf from the Intere&s;ts of
<PB N="16" REF="37">
<HI>France.</HI> The Lords agreed to the propo&s;ition without any op|po&s;ition. So it was &s;ent down to the Commons. There were great Debates there upon it. <HI>Hambden</HI> pre&s;&s;ed it vehemently. But <HI>Wildman,</HI> and all the Republican Party, oppo&s;ed it. Their &s;ecret Rea&s;on &s;eemed to be, a de&s;ign to extingui&s;h Monarchy, and therefore to &s;ub&s;titute none, beyond the three that were nam|ed, that &s;o the Succe&s;&s;ion might quickly come to an end. But, it not being decent to own this, all that they pretended was, that there being many in the lineal Succe&s;&s;ion, after the three that were named, who were then of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> the leaving to them a po&s;&s;ibility to &s;ucceed, upon their turning Prote&s;tants, might have a good effect on them, and di&s;po&s;e them to hearken to In&s;truction; all which would be defeated by a Declaration in favour of the Dutche&s;s.</P>
<P>To this it was an&s;wered, in a free Conference, that for that very rea&s;on it was fit to make this Declaration: Since nothing could bring us into a more certain danger, than a pretended Conver&s;ion of a fal&s;e Convert, who might by &s;uch a di&s;gui&s;e a&s;|cend the Throne, and &s;o work our ruine by &s;ecret artifices. Both Hou&s;es adhered, after the free Conference. So the Bill fell for that time: But it was re&s;olved to take it up at the opening of the next Se&s;&s;ion. And the King thought, it was not then convenient to renew the motion of the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Hanover,</HI> of which he ordered me to write her a particular account. It was fit once to have the Bill pa&s;&s;ed, that enacted the perpetual Ex|clu&s;ion of all Papi&s;ts: For that, upon the matter, brought the Succe&s;&s;ion to their door. And if any in the Line, before Her, &s;hould pretend to change, as it was not very likely to happen, &s;o it would not be ea&s;ily believed. So it was re&s;olved to carry this matter no further at this time. The Bill pa&s;&s;ed without any oppo&s;ition, in the beginning of the next Se&s;&s;ion; which I mention here, that I might end this matter all at once. The pre&s;ent Se&s;&s;ion was drawn to a great length, and was not ended till <HI>Augu&s;t:</HI> And then it broke up with a great deal of ill hu|mour.</P>
<P>One accident happen'd this Summer, of a pretty extraordi|nary <NOTE PLACE="marg">King <HI>James</HI>'s Great Seal found in the <HI>Thames.</HI></NOTE> nature, that de&s;erves to be remembred. A Fi&s;her-man, between <HI>Lambeth</HI> and <HI>Vaux-hall,</HI> was drawing a Net pretty clo&s;e to the Chanel; and a great weight was, not without &s;ome difficulty, drawn to the Shore, which, when taken up, was found to be the Great Seal of <HI>England.</HI> King <HI>James</HI> had cal|led for it from the Lord <HI>Jefferies,</HI> the night before he went away, as intending to make a &s;ecret u&s;e of it, for Pardons or Grants. But it &s;eems, when he went away, he thought either,
<PB N="17" REF="38">
that the Bulk or Weight of it made it inconvenient to be carried off, or that it was to be hereafter of no more u&s;e to him: And therefore, that it might not be made u&s;e of again&s;t him, he threw it into the <HI>Thames.</HI> The Fi&s;her-man was well rewarded, when he brought the Great Seal to the King: And by his Order it was broke.</P>
<P>But now I mu&s;t look over to the affairs of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and to <NOTE PLACE="marg">The State of Affairs in <HI>Ireland.</HI></NOTE> King <HI>James</HI>'s motions. Upon his coming to the Court of <HI>France,</HI> he was received with great &s;hews of Tenderne&s;s and Re|&s;pect; the <HI>French</HI> King a&s;&s;uring him, that, as they had both the &s;ame Intere&s;ts, &s;o he would never give over the War, till he had re&s;tored him to his Throne. The only pro&s;pect he now had, was to keep up his Party in <HI>Ireland</HI> and <HI>Scotland.</HI> The Me&s;&s;age from <HI>Tirconnel,</HI> for &s;peedy Supplies, was very pre&s;|&s;ing: And his Party in <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;ent one <HI>Lind&s;ay</HI> over to him, to offer him their &s;ervice, and to ask what a&s;&s;i&s;tance they might depend upon. The <HI>French</HI> Mini&s;try was at this time much di|vided. <HI>Louvois</HI> had the greate&s;t credit, and was very &s;ucce&s;&s;|ful in all his Coun&s;els: &s;o that he was mo&s;t con&s;idered. But <HI>Seignelay</HI> was believed to have more per&s;onal favour, and to be more entirely united to Madam <HI>Maintenon.</HI> The&s;e two were in a high competition for favour, and hated one another. <HI>Seigne|lay</HI> had the Marine, as the other had the Army, for his province. So, King <HI>James</HI> having the mo&s;t dependance on the Marine, and looking on the Secretary for that Po&s;t as the mo&s;t powerful Fa|vourite, made his chief application to him; which &s;et <HI>Louvois</HI> to cro&s;s and retard every thing, that was propo&s;ed for his &s;ervice. So that matters for him went on &s;lowly, and very defectively. There was another circum&s;tance in King <HI>James</HI>'s aflairs, that did him much hurt. <HI>Lau&s;un,</HI> who&s;e adventures will be found in the <HI>French</HI> Hi&s;tory, had come over to King <HI>James,</HI> and of|fered him his &s;ervice, and had attended on the Queen, when &s;he went over to <HI>France.</HI> He had obtained a promi&s;e of King <HI>James,</HI> that he &s;hould have the Command of &s;uch Forces, as the King of <HI>France</HI> would a&s;&s;i&s;t him with. <HI>Louvois</HI> hated <HI>Lau&s;un;</HI> nor did the King of <HI>France</HI> like to employ him: So <HI>Louvois</HI> &s;ent to King <HI>James,</HI> de&s;iring him to ask of the King of <HI>France, Souvray,</HI> a Son of his, whom he was breeding to &s;erve in War, to command the <HI>French</HI> Troops. But King <HI>James</HI> had &s;o engaged him&s;elf to <HI>Lau&s;un,</HI> that he thought he could not in honour depart from it. And ever after that, we were told, that <HI>Louvois</HI> &s;tudied, by all the ways he could think of, to di&s;parage him, and all the Propo&s;itions he made: Yet he got about 5000 <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> to be &s;ent over with him to
<PB N="18" REF="39">
<HI>Ireland,</HI> but no great &s;upplies in money. Promi&s;es were &s;ent the <HI>Scots</HI> of great a&s;&s;i&s;tance, that &s;hould be &s;ent them from <HI>Ire|land:</HI> They were encouraged to make all po&s;&s;ible oppo&s;ition in the Convention: And, as &s;oon as the &s;ea&s;on of the year would admit of it, they were ordered to gather together in the High|lands, <NOTE PLACE="marg">King <HI>James</HI> came over thither.</NOTE> and to keep them&s;elves in &s;afe places there, till further Orders &s;hould be &s;ent them. With the&s;e, and with a &s;mall &s;upply in money, of about five or &s;ix thou&s;and Pounds, for buy|ing Ammunition and Arms, <HI>Lind&s;ay</HI> was &s;ent back. I had &s;uch a character given me of him, that I entertained good thoughts of him. So, upon his return, he came fir&s;t to me, and pre|tended he had gone over on private affairs, being deeply en|gaged in debt for the Earl of <HI>Melfort,</HI> who&s;e Secretary he had been. I under&s;tood from him, that King <HI>James</HI> had left <HI>Pa|ris</HI> to go for <HI>Ireland:</HI> So I &s;ent him to the Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI>'s Office: But there was a &s;ecret management with one of the Under Secretaries there for King <HI>James:</HI> So he was not only di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, but got a Pa&s;s Warrant from Dr. <HI>Wynne,</HI> to go to <HI>Scot|land.</HI> I had given the Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> &s;uch a character of the man, that he did more ea&s;ily believe him; but he knew nothing of the Pa&s;s Warrant. So, my ea&s;ine&s;s to think well of people, was the chief occa&s;ion of the mi&s;chief that followed, on his not being clapt up and more narrowly examined. Upon King <HI>James</HI>'s landing in <HI>Ireland,</HI> he marched his Army from <HI>Kin&s;ale</HI> to <HI>Ul&s;ter.</HI> And, when it was all together, it con&s;i&s;ted of 30,000 Foot, and 8000 Hor&s;e. It is true, the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> were now as in&s;olent, as they were undi&s;ciplined: And they began to think they mu&s;t be ma&s;ters of all the King's Coun&s;els. A jealou&s;y aro&s;e between them and the <HI>French:</HI> They were &s;oon on very bad Terms, and &s;carce ever agreed in their Advices: All King <HI>James</HI>'s party, in the I&s;le of <HI>Britain,</HI> pre&s;&s;ed his &s;ettling the affairs of <HI>Ireland</HI> the be&s;t he could, and his bring|ing over the <HI>French,</HI> and &s;uch of the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> as he could be&s;t govern, and depend on; and advi&s;ed him to land in the North of <HI>England,</HI> or in the We&s;t of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>But the fir&s;t thing that was to be done, was to reduce <HI>Lon|donderry.</HI> In order to this, two different Advices were offered. <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Siege of <HI>London|derry.</HI></NOTE> The one was, to march with a great Force, and to take it im|mediately: for the Town was not capable of re&s;i&s;ting, if vi|gorou&s;ly attack'd. The other was, to block it up &s;o, that it &s;hould be forced in a little time to &s;urrender; and to turn to other more vigorous de&s;igns. But, whereas either of the&s;e Advices might have been pur&s;ued with advantage, a third Advice was offered, but I know not by whom, which was
<PB N="19" REF="40">
the only bad one, that could be propo&s;ed; and yet, by a &s;ort of fatality, which hung over that King, it was followed by him; and that was, to pre&s;s the Town by a &s;low Siege, which, as was given out, would bring the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> into the methods of War, and would accu&s;tom them to Fatigue and Di&s;cipline. And this being re&s;olved on, King <HI>James</HI> &s;ent a &s;mall Body before it, which was often changed: And by the&s;e he continued the Siege above two months, in which the poor Inhabitants formed them&s;elves into great Order, and came to generous Re&s;olutions of enduring the la&s;t extremities. They made &s;ome Sallies, in which the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> always ran away, and left their Officers; &s;o that many of their be&s;t Officers were killed. Tho&s;e within &s;uffered little, but by hunger, which de&s;troyed near two thirds of their number. One Convoy, with two Regiments, and Provi&s;ions, was &s;ent to their relief: But they looked on the &s;ervice as de&s;perate, being deceived by <HI>Lundy,</HI> who was the Governour of the Place, and had undertaken to betray it to King <HI>James;</HI> but he finding them jealous of him, came to the Convoy, and per&s;uaded them that nothing could be done: So they came back, and <HI>Lundy</HI> with them. Yet the poor Inhabitants, tho' thus for&s;aken, re&s;olved &s;till to hold out; and &s;ent over &s;uch an account of the &s;tate they were in, that a &s;e|cond and greater Convoy was &s;ent, with about 5000 men, commanded by <HI>Kirk,</HI> who, after he came in &s;ight, made not that ha&s;te to relieve them that was nece&s;&s;ary, con&s;idering the mi&s;ery they were in. They had a River that came up to their Town: But the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> had laid a Bomb and Chains cro&s;s it, and had planted Batteries for defending it. Yet a Ship &s;ail|ing up with Wind and Tide broke through: And &s;o the Town was relieved, and the Siege rai&s;ed in great confu&s;ion. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Was at la&s;t rai&s;d.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Iniskillin</HI> had the &s;ame fate: The Inhabitants entred into Re&s;olutions of &s;uffering any thing, rather than fall into the hands of the <HI>Iri&s;h:</HI> A con&s;iderable Force was &s;ent again&s;t them: but thro' their courage, and the cowardice of the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> they held out.</P>
<P>All this while, an Army was preparing in <HI>England,</HI> to be &s;ent over for the Reduction of <HI>Ireland,</HI> commanded by <HI>Schom|berg,</HI> who was made a Duke in <HI>England,</HI> and to whom the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Duke $span$ to <HI>Ire|land.</HI></NOTE> Parliament gave 100,000 Pounds for the &s;ervices he had done. The Levies were carried on in <HI>England</HI> with great zeal: And the Bodies were quickly full. But, tho' both Offi|cers and Soldiers &s;hewed much courage and affection to the &s;ervice; yet they were raw, without experience, and without skill. <HI>Schomberg</HI> had a quick and happy pa&s;&s;age; with about
<PB N="20" REF="41">
10,000 men. He landed at <HI>Belfa&s;t,</HI> and brought the Forces that lay in <HI>Ul&s;ter</HI> together. His Army, when &s;tronge&s;t, was not above 14,000 men; and he had not above 2000 Hor&s;e. He marched on to <HI>Dundalk;</HI> and there po&s;ted him&s;elf. King <HI>James</HI> came to <HI>Ardee,</HI> within five or &s;ix miles of him, being above thrice his number. <HI>Schomberg</HI> had not the Supplies from <HI>England,</HI> that had been promi&s;ed him: Much treachery or ravenou&s;ne&s;s appeared in many, who were employed. And he finding his numbers &s;o unequal to the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> re&s;olved to lie on the defen&s;ive. He lay there &s;ix weeks in a very rainy Sea|&s;on. His men, for want of due care and good management, contracted &s;uch Di&s;ea&s;es, that he lo&s;t almo&s;t the one half of his Army. Some blamed him for not putting things more to hazard: It was &s;aid, that he mea&s;ured the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> by their Numbers, and not by their want of Sen&s;e and Courage. Such complaints were &s;ent of this to the King, that he wrote twice to him, pre&s;&s;ing him to put &s;omewhat to the venture: But he &s;aw the Enemy was well po&s;ted, and well provided: And he knew they had &s;everal good Officers among them. If he had pu&s;hed matters, and had met with a misfortune, his whole Army, and con&s;equently all <HI>Ireland,</HI> would have been lo&s;t: For he could not have made a regular Retreat. The &s;ure game was to pre&s;erve his Army: And that would &s;ave <HI>Ul&s;ter,</HI> and keep matters entire for another year. This was cen&s;ured by &s;ome; But better judges thought, the managing this Campaign as he did, was one of the greate&s;t parts of his Life. The <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> made &s;ome poor attempts to beat up his Quarters: But even where they &s;urpri&s;ed his men, and were much &s;uperior in number, they were &s;o &s;hamefully beat back, that this encrea&s;ed the contempt, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> naturally had for them. In the end of <HI>October,</HI> all went into Winter Quarters.</P>
<P>Our operations on the Sea were not very pro&s;perous. <HI>Her|bert</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">A flairs at Sea.</NOTE> was &s;ent with a Fleet, to cut off the communication be|tween <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Ireland.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> had &s;ent over a Fleet, with a great Tran&s;port of Stores and Ammunition. They had landed their loading, and were returning back. As they came out of <HI>Bantry</HI> Bay, <HI>Herbert</HI> engaged them. The wind was again&s;t him: So that it was not po&s;&s;ible for the greate&s;t part of the Fleet to come up, and enter into action: And &s;o tho&s;e who engaged were forced to retire with &s;ome di&s;ad|vantage. But the <HI>French</HI> did not pur&s;ue him.

Summer: So that ours lay &s;ome months at Sea to no purpo&s;e. But, if we lo&s;t few of our Seamen in the Engagement, we lo&s;t a great many, by rea&s;on of the bad Victualling. Some excu&s;ed this, becau&s;e it was &s;o late in the year, before Funds were made for it: while others imputed it to ba&s;e practices, and wor&s;e de&s;igns. So affairs had every where a very melancholy face.</P>
<P>I now turn to give an Account of the Proceedings in <HI>Scot|land.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> A Convention of the States was &s;ummoned there, in the &s;ame manner as in <HI>England.</HI> Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> was cho|&s;en Pre&s;ident. And, a Letter being offered to them, from King <HI>James</HI> by <HI>Lind&s;ay,</HI> they would not receive, nor read it: But went on to &s;tate the &s;everal Violations of their Con|&s;titution and Laws, made by King <HI>James.</HI> Upon the&s;e it was moved, that a Judgment &s;hould be given, declaring, that he had forfeited his Right to the Crown. Upon this, three Par|ties were formed: One was compo&s;ed of all the Bi&s;hops, and &s;ome of the Nobility, who oppo&s;ed the&s;e Proceedings again&s;t <NOTE PLACE="marg">Debates in the Conven|tion.</NOTE> the King, as contrary to their Laws and Oaths: Others thought, that their Oaths were only to the King, as having the execu|tive Power, to &s;upport him in that; but that, if he &s;et him|&s;elf to invade and a&s;&s;ume the Legi&s;lature, he renounced his former Authority by &s;ubverting that, upon which it was found|ed: So they were for proceeding to a declaratory Judgment: A third Party was formed, of tho&s;e who agreed with the for|mer in their Conclu&s;ion: But not in coming to &s;o &s;peedy a determination. They thought, it was the Intere&s;t of <HI>Scotland</HI> to be brought under the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> and to be united to the Parliament of <HI>England;</HI> and that this was the propere&s;t time for doing that to the be&s;t advantage; &s;ince <HI>England</HI> would be obliged, by the pre&s;ent &s;tate of Affairs, to receive them upon good terms. They were therefore willing to pro|ceed again&s;t King <HI>James:</HI> But they thought it not rea&s;onable to make too much ha&s;te in a new Settlement; and were for maintaining the Government, in an Interregnum, till the Union &s;hould be perfected, or at lea&s;t put in a probable way. This was &s;pecious, and many went into it: But, &s;ince it tended to the putting a &s;top to a full Settlement, all that favoured King <HI>James</HI> joined in it: For by this more time was gained. To this Project it was objected, that the Union of the two Kingdoms mu&s;t be a work of time; &s;ince many difficulties would ari&s;e in any Treaty about it: whereas the pre&s;ent cir|cum&s;tances were critical, and required a &s;peedy deci&s;ion, and quick provi&s;ion to be made for their &s;ecurity; &s;ince, if they
<PB N="22" REF="43">
continued in &s;uch a neutral State, they would have many Enemies, and no Friends: And the zeal that was now working among them for Presbytery, mu&s;t rai&s;e a greater aver&s;ion than ordi|nary, in the Body that was for the Church of <HI>England,</HI> to any &s;uch Treaty with them.</P>
<P>While much heat was occa&s;ioned by this Debate, great Num|bers came armed from the We&s;tern Counties, on pretence to defend the Convention: For the Duke of <HI>Gordon</HI> was &s;till in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and could have done them much harm, tho' he lay there in a very inoffen&s;ive &s;tate. He thought the be&s;t thing he could do was, to pre&s;erve that place long for King <HI>James;</HI> &s;ince to provoke the Convention, would have drawn a Siege and ruine upon him, with too much precipi|tation, while there was not a Force in the Field ready to come and a&s;&s;i&s;t him. So it was &s;aid, there was no need of &s;uch armed Companies, and that they were come to over-awe and force the Convention.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Dundee</HI> had been at <HI>London,</HI> and had fixed <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Ri&s;ing de|&s;igned there.</NOTE> a corre&s;pondence both with <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France:</HI> tho' he had employed me to carry Me&s;&s;ages, from him to the King, to know what Security he might expect, if he &s;hould go and live in <HI>Scotland</HI> without owning his Government. The King &s;aid, If he would live peaceably, and at home, he would pro|tect him: To this he an&s;wered, that, unle&s;s he were forced to it, he would live quietly. But he went down with other re&s;olu|tions; and all the Party re&s;olved to &s;ubmit to his command. Upon his coming to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> he pretended he was in dan|ger from tho&s;e armed multitudes: And &s;o he left the Conven|tion; and went up and down the High-lands, and &s;ent his Agents about, to bring together what Force they could gather. This &s;et on the Conclu&s;ion of the Debates of the Convention.</P>
<P>They pa&s;&s;ed the Judgment of Forfeiture on King <HI>James.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">King <HI>James</HI> was judged there.</NOTE> And on the 11th of <HI>April,</HI> the day in which the King and Queen were crowned, with the ordinary Solemnities at <HI>We&s;tmin|&s;ter,</HI> they declared <HI>William</HI> and <HI>Mary</HI> King and Queen of <HI>Scotland.</HI> But with this, as they ordered the Coronation-Oath to be tendered to them, &s;o they drew up a Claim of Rights, which they pretended, were the fundamental and unalterable Laws of the Kingdom. By one of the&s;e it was declared, that the Reformation in <HI>Scotland,</HI> having been begun by a parity among the Clergy, all Prelacy in that Church was a great and in&s;upportable Grievance to that Kingdom. It was an ab&s;urd thing to put this in a Claim of Rights; for which not only they had no Law, but which was contrary to many Laws then
<PB N="23" REF="44">
in being: So that, tho' they might have offered it as a Griev|ance, there was no colour for pretending it was a National Right. But they had a Notion among them, that every Article, that &s;hould be put in the Claim of Rights, became an unalter|able Law, and a Condition upon which the Crown was to be <NOTE PLACE="marg">They pa&s;s a Claim of Rights.</NOTE> held: whereas Grievances were &s;uch things, as were &s;ubmitted to the King and Parliament to be redre&s;&s;ed, or not, as they &s;hould &s;ee cau&s;e: But the Bi&s;hops, and tho&s;e who adhered to them, having left the Convention, the Presbyterians had a ma|jority of Voices to carry every thing as they plea&s;ed, how un|rea&s;onable &s;oever. And upon this, the aboli&s;hing Epi&s;copacy in <HI>Scotland,</HI> was made a nece&s;&s;ary Article of the new Settle|ment.</P>
<P>Soon after the King came to St. <HI>James</HI>'s, the Epi&s;copal Party <NOTE PLACE="marg">Epi&s;copacy by this was aboli&s;hed.</NOTE> there, had &s;ent up the Dean of <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> whom they ordered to come to me: And I introduced him to the then Prince. He was &s;ent to know, what his Intentions were with relation to them. He an&s;wered, he would do all he could to pre&s;erve them, granting a full Toleration to the Presbyterians: But this was, in ca&s;e they concurred in the new Settlement of that Kingdom: For if they oppo&s;ed that, and if, by a great Ma|jority in Parliament, Re&s;olutions &s;hould be taken again&s;t them, the King could not make a War for them: but yet he would do all that was in his Power to maintain &s;uch of them, as &s;hould live peaceably in their Functions. This he ordered me likewi&s;e to write back, in an&s;wer to what &s;ome Bi&s;hops and others had writ to me upon that &s;ubject. But the Earl of <HI>Dundee,</HI> when he went down, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them with &s;uch an opinion of another &s;peedy Revolution, that would be brought about in favour of King <HI>James,</HI> that they re&s;olved to adhere firmly to his Intere&s;ts: So, they declaring in a body, with &s;o much zeal, in oppo&s;ition to the new Settlement, it was not po&s;|&s;ible for the King to pre&s;erve that Government there: All tho&s;e who expre&s;&s;ed their zeal for him, being equally zealous again&s;t that Order.</P>
<P>Among tho&s;e who appeared in this Convention, none di&s;tin|gui&s;hed him&s;elf more, than Sir <HI>James Montgomery,</HI> a Gentle|man of good Parts, but of a mo&s;t unbridled heat, and of a re&s;tle&s;s ambition: He bore the greate&s;t &s;hare in the whole De|bate, and promi&s;ed him&s;elf a great Po&s;t in the new Govern|ment. Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> pre&s;ided with great di&s;cretion and cou|rage: So that the bringing the Settlement &s;o &s;oon to a calm conclu&s;ion, was chiefly owing to him. A Petition of Grievances, relating to the Lords of the Articles, the Judges, the Coin,
<PB N="24" REF="45">
and &s;everal other matters, was al&s;o &s;ettled: And three Com|mi&s;&s;ioners were &s;ent, one from every State, to the King and Queen, with the Tender of the Crown, with which they were al&s;o to tender them the Coronation-Oath, and the Claim of Rights: And when the Oath was taken, they were next to offer the Petition, for the Redre&s;s of Grievances. The three Commi&s;&s;ioners were, the Earl of <HI>Argyle</HI> for the <HI>Lords,</HI> Sir <HI>James Montgomery</HI> for the <HI>Knights,</HI> or, as they call them, for the Barons, and Sir <HI>John Dalrymple</HI> for the <HI>Burroughs.</HI> When the King and Queen took the Oaths, the King explained one word in the Oath, by which he was bound <HI>to repre&s;s Here|&s;ies,</HI> that he did not by this bind him&s;elf to per&s;ecute any for their Con&s;cience. And now he was King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as well as of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing to be done was, to form a Mini&s;try in <HI>Scot|land,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Mini&s;try in <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> and a Council; and to &s;end In&s;tructions, for turning the Convention into a Parliament, in which the Duke of <HI>Hamil|ton</HI> was to repre&s;ent the King, as his Commi&s;&s;ioner. Before the King had left the <HI>Hague, Fagel</HI> had &s;o effectually recom|mended <HI>Dalrymple,</HI> the Father, to him, that he was re&s;olved to rely chiefly on him for advice. And, tho' he had heard great complaints of him, as indeed there was &s;ome ground for them, yet, &s;ince his Son was &s;ent One of the three, upon &s;o great a Deputation, he concluded from thence that the Fa|mily was not &s;o much hated, as he had been informed: So he continued &s;till to be advi&s;ed by him. The Epi&s;copal Party were afraid of <HI>Montgomery</HI>'s being made Secretary, from whom they expected nothing but extream &s;everities: So they &s;et them|&s;elves to divert that, and the Lord <HI>Melvil,</HI> who had married the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s Si&s;ter, and had continued from 1660 firm to Presbytery, and had been of late forced to leave the Kingdom, was looked on as an ea&s;y Man, who would have credit enough to re&s;train the fury of that Party. So he was made &s;ole Secretary of State; which proved a very unhappy &s;tep: for, as he was by his Principle bigotted to Presbytery, and ready to &s;acrifice every thing to their humours, &s;o he prov|ed to be in all re&s;pects a narrow hearted man, who minded his own Intere&s;t more, than either that of the King or of his Coun|try. This choice gave a great di&s;ta&s;te: And that was followed by a Mini&s;try, in the framing of which he had the chief hand; who were weak and pa&s;&s;ionate men. All Offices were &s;plit into Commi&s;&s;ions, that many might have &s;ome &s;hare: But it rendred them all contemptible: And, tho' <HI>Montgomery</HI> had a con&s;iderable Po&s;t offered him, yet his mi&s;&s;ing that he aimed
<PB N="25" REF="46">
at &s;tuck deep, and began to work in him an aver&s;ion to the King, which broke out afterwards into much fury and plotting again&s;t him. Nor did Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> think, that he was con|&s;idered, in the new model of the Mini&s;try, as he de&s;erved, and might ju&s;tly have expected.</P>
<P>The Parliament there was opened with much ill humour: <NOTE PLACE="marg">A faction rai&s;ed in <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> And they re&s;olved to carry the Redre&s;s of Grievances very far. Lord <HI>Melvill</HI> hoped to have gained the Presbyterian Party, by &s;ending In&s;tructions to Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> to open the Se&s;&s;ion with an Act in favour of Presbytery: But the Majority re&s;olved to begin with their Temporal concerns. So the fir&s;t Grievance, to which a Redre&s;s was de&s;ired, was the Power of the Lords of the Articles; that relating &s;o immediately to the Parliament it&s;elf. The King con&s;ented to a proper Regulation, as that the number &s;hould be enlarged and changed, as often as the Parliament &s;hould de&s;ire it, and that the Parliament might bring matters before them, tho' they were rejected by the Lords of the Ar|ticles. This an&s;wered all the ju&s;t complaints, that had been made of that part of the Con&s;titution: But the King thought it was the Intere&s;t of the Crown, to pre&s;erve it thus regulated: Yet it was pretended, that, if the name and &s;hadow of that were &s;till kept up, the Parliament would in &s;ome time be in|&s;en&s;ibly brought under all tho&s;e Re&s;traints, that were now to be provided again&s;t. So they moved to take it quite away. Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> writ long Letters, both to the King and to the Lord <HI>Melvill,</HI> giving a full account of the progre&s;s of an ill humour, that was got among them, and of the ill con&s;equence it was like to have: But he had no an&s;wer from the King: And Lord <HI>Melvill</HI> writ him back dark and doubtful orders: So he took little care how matters went, and was not ill plea&s;ed to &s;ee them go wrong. The Revenue was &s;ettled on the King for life: And they rai&s;ed the money, which was nece&s;&s;ary for maintaining a &s;mall Force in that Kingdom, tho' the greate&s;t part of an Army of 6000 men was paid by <HI>England.</HI> But even the Presbyterians began to carry their Demands high; They propo&s;ed to have the King's Supremacy, and the Right of Patronage taken away: And they asked &s;o high an Authority to their Government, that Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> tho' of him&s;elf indifferent as to tho&s;e matters, yet would not agree to them. He thought, the&s;e broke in too much on their Temporal concerns; and would e&s;tabli&s;h a Ty|ranny in Presbytery, that could not be ea&s;ily born. He writ to me very fully on that head, and I took the liberty to &s;peak &s;ometimes to the King on tho&s;e &s;ubjects; my de&s;ign being chiefly to &s;helter the Epi&s;copal Clergy, and to keep the change,
<PB N="26" REF="47">
that was now to be made, on &s;uch a foot, that a door might &s;till be kept open: But Lord <HI>Melvill</HI> had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the King with a notion, that it was nece&s;&s;ary for his &s;ervice, that the Pre&s;|byterians &s;hould know, that I did not at all meddle in tho&s;e matters, otherwi&s;e they would take up a jealou&s;y of every thing that was done; and that this might make them carry their demands much further: So I was &s;hut out from all meddling in tho&s;e matters: And yet I was then, and &s;till continue to be much loaded with this prejudice, that I did not &s;tudy to hinder tho&s;e changes, that were then made in <HI>Scotland.</HI> And all the King's enemies in <HI>England</HI> continued &s;till to charge him, for the alterations then made in <HI>Scotland;</HI> tho' it was not po&s;|&s;ible, had he been ever &s;o zealous for Epi&s;copacy, to have pre|&s;erved it at that time: And I could do no more than I did, both for the Order it&s;elf, and for all tho&s;e who adhered to it there. A new debate was &s;et on foot in that Parliament, concerning the Judges. By the Law there, when the King names a Judge, he ought to be examined by other Judges, whe|ther he is qualified as the Law directs: But, in the year 1661, becau&s;e the Bench was to be filled with a new &s;ett of Judges, &s;o that there was none to examine the re&s;t, the nomination the King then made, was read in Parliament: And, no ob|jection being made to any of them, they did upon that &s;it and act as Judges. It was expected, that the &s;ame method &s;hould be followed at this time. But in&s;tead of that, the King con|tinued &s;uch a number of the former Judges, as was &s;ufficient to examine tho&s;e, who were now to be advanced: So that was ordered to be done. Upon this tho&s;e, who oppo&s;ed every thing, pretended, that the Nomination ought to be made in Parliament: And they had prepared Objections again&s;t every one, that was upon the Li&s;t; intending by this to put a publick Affront on one of the Fir&s;t, and mo&s;t important Actions of the King's Government. Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> had a po&s;itive In|&s;truction &s;ent him, not to &s;uffer this matter to be brought into Parliament: Yet he &s;aw the Party was &s;o &s;et, and &s;o &s;trong, that they had a clear Majority: Nor did he him&s;elf very much approve of the Nomination, chiefly that of old <HI>Dalrymple,</HI> &s;oon after made Lord <HI>Stair,</HI> to be Pre&s;ident. So he di&s;continued the Parliament.</P>
<P>But, while tho&s;e animo&s;ities were thus fomented, the Earl of <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Ri&s;ing in <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Dundee</HI> had got together a con&s;iderable body of Gentlemen, with &s;ome Thou&s;ands of Highlanders. He &s;ent &s;everal Me&s;|&s;engers over to <HI>Ireland,</HI> pre&s;&s;ing King <HI>James</HI> to come, either to the North of <HI>England,</HI> or to <HI>Scotland.</HI> But, at the &s;ame
<PB N="27" REF="48">
time he de&s;ired, that he would not bring the Lord <HI>Melfort</HI> over with him, or employ him more in <HI>Scotch</HI> Bu&s;ine&s;s; and that he would be contented with the exerci&s;e of his own Religion. It may be ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;ed, that all this went again&s;t the grain with King <HI>James;</HI> and that the Lord <HI>Melfort</HI> di&s;paraged all the Earl of <HI>Dundee</HI>'s undertakings. In this he was much &s;up|ported by the <HI>French</HI> near that King, who had it given them in charge (as a main in&s;truction) to keep him up to a high own|ing of his Religion, and of all tho&s;e who were of it; and not to &s;uffer him to enter into any Treaty or Conditions with his Prote&s;tant Subjects, by which the Papi&s;ts &s;hould in any &s;ort &s;uffer, or be &s;o much as di&s;couraged. The <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> were willing enough to cro&s;s the Seas to <HI>England,</HI> but would not con&s;ent to the going over to <HI>Scotland.</HI> So the Earl of <HI>Dundee</HI> was furni&s;hed with &s;ome &s;mall &s;tore of Arms and Ammunition, and had kind promi&s;es, encouraging him, and all that joined with him.</P>
<P><HI>Mackay,</HI> a General Officer, that had &s;erved long in <HI>Holland</HI> with great reputation, and who was the piou&s;e&s;t man I ever knew, in a Military way, was &s;ent down to command the Army in <HI>Scotland.</HI> He was one of the be&s;t Officers of the Age, when he had nothing to do but to obey and execute Orders; for he was both diligent, obliging and brave: But he was not &s;o fitted for command. His Piety made him too apt to mi&s;tru&s;t his own Sen&s;e, and to be too tender, or rather fearful, in any thing, where there might be a needle&s;s effu&s;ion of blood. He followed the Earl of <HI>Dundee</HI>'s motions, who was le&s;s encum|ber'd with Cannon and other Baggage, and &s;o marched quicker than it was po&s;&s;ible for him to follow: His men were for the mo&s;t part new-levied, and without experience; but he had &s;ome old Bodies, on whom he depended. The heads of the Clanns among the Highlanders, promi&s;ed to join him: but mo&s;t of them went to the Earl of <HI>Dundee.</HI> At la&s;t, after many marches and motions, they came to an engagement at <HI>Gilli|cranky,</HI> &s;ome few miles above <HI>Dunkell:</HI> The ground was narrow: And Lord <HI>Dundee</HI> had the advantage: He broke through <HI>Mac|kay</HI>'s Army, and they ran for it: And probably, if the Earl of <HI>Dundee</HI> had out-lived that day, the Victory might have been pur&s;ued far: But a random &s;hot put an end to his life, and to the whole de&s;ign: For <HI>Mackay</HI> rallied his men, and made &s;uch a &s;tand, that the other &s;ide fell into great di&s;order, and could never be formed again into a con&s;iderable Body: A Fort was &s;oon after built at <HI>Innerlocky,</HI> which was called <HI>Fort Wil|liam,</HI> and &s;erved to cut off the communication between the Nor|thern and Southern Highlanders.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="49">
During all the&s;e publick di&s;orders, that happen'd in &s;o many different places, the Trade &s;uffered con&s;iderably: For the <HI>French,</HI> not &s;etting out a Fleet any more, &s;ent out &s;o many Crui&s;ers and Privateers into our Seas, that <HI>England</HI> thereby &s;uffered great lo&s;&s;es; there not being at that time a &s;ufficient number of Fri|gates to convoy and &s;ecure the Merchant-men. We &s;eemed to be Ma&s;ters at Sea, and yet were great Lo&s;ers there.</P>
<P>Affairs went much better on the <HI>Rhine.</HI> The Imperial Army, commanded by the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> took <HI>Mentz,</HI> which the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Foreign Affairs.</NOTE> <HI>French</HI> had entred, after they took <HI>Philipsburg:</HI> The Siege was &s;low and long, but pro&s;perous in its conclu&s;ion: And by this means <HI>Franconia,</HI> which before lay expo&s;ed, was now covered. The Elector of <HI>Brandenburg</HI> came down with an Army, and cleared the Archbi&s;hoprick of <HI>Coloign,</HI> which was before po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by <HI>French</HI> Garri&s;ons. <HI>Keizerwart</HI> and <HI>Bonne</HI> held him &s;ome time: but the re&s;t were &s;oon taken. So now the <HI>Rhine</HI> was open all up to <HI>Mentz.</HI> Nothing pa&s;&s;ed in <HI>Flanders,</HI> where Prince <HI>Waldeck</HI> commanded: And the Campaign ended with|out any mifortunes on that &s;ide.</P>
<P>I now return to the affairs of <HI>England,</HI> during the Rece&s;s. <NOTE PLACE="marg">A jealou&s;y of the King &s;pread a|mong the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Clergy.</NOTE> The Clergy generally took the Oaths, tho' with too many re|&s;ervations and di&s;tinctions, which laid them open to &s;evere cen|&s;ures, as if they had taken them again&s;t their Con&s;cience. The King was &s;u&s;pected by them, by rea&s;on of the favour &s;hewed to Di&s;&s;enters, but chiefly for his aboli&s;hing Epi&s;copacy in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and his con&s;enting to the &s;etting up Presbytery there. This gave &s;ome credit to the Reports, that were with great indu&s;try infu&s;ed into many of them, of the King's cold|ne&s;s at be&s;t, if not his aver&s;ion, to the Church of <HI>England.</HI> The leading men in both Univer&s;ities, chiefly <HI>Oxford,</HI> were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with this; And it began to have very ill effects over all <HI>England.</HI> Tho&s;e who did not carry this &s;o far as to think, as &s;ome &s;aid they did, that the Church was to be pulled down; yet &s;aid, a Latitudinarian Party was like to prevail, and to en|gro&s;s all Preferments. The&s;e were thought le&s;s bigotted to outward Ceremonies: So now it was generally &s;pread about, that men zealous for the Church would be neglected, and that tho&s;e who were more indifferent in &s;uch matters, would be preferred. Many of the latter had managed the Controver|&s;ies with the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> with &s;o much clearne&s;s, and with that &s;ucce&s;s, that the Papi&s;ts, to revenge them&s;elves, and to bla&s;t tho&s;e, whom they con&s;idered as their mo&s;t formidable Enemies, had ca&s;t a&s;per&s;ions on them as <HI>Socinians,</HI> and as men that denied all My&s;teries. And now, &s;ome angry men at <HI>Ox|ford,</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="50">
who apprehended that tho&s;e Divines were likely to be mo&s;t con&s;idered in this Reign, took up the &s;ame method of Calumny; and began to treat them as <HI>Socinians.</HI> The Earl of <HI>Clarendon,</HI> and &s;ome of the Bi&s;hops, who had already incurred the Su&s;pen&s;ion, for not taking the Oaths to the Government, took much ill-natured pains to &s;pread the&s;e Slanders. Six Bi&s;hopricks happened to fall within this year: <HI>Salisbury, Che&s;|ter, Bangor, Worce&s;ter, Chiche&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Bri&s;tol:</HI> So that the King named &s;ix Bi&s;hops within &s;ix months. And the Per&s;ons promoted to the&s;e Sees were, generally, men of tho&s;e princi|ples. The proceedings in <HI>Scotland</HI> ca&s;t a great load on the King: He could not hinder the change of the Government of that Church, without putting all his affairs in great di&s;order. The Epi&s;copal Party went almo&s;t univer&s;ally into King <HI>James</HI>'s Intere&s;ts: So that the Presbyterians were the only Party, that the King had in that Kingdom. The King did indeed a&s;&s;ure us, and my &s;elf in particular, that he would re&s;train and mo|derate the violence of the Presbyterians. Lord <HI>Melvill</HI> did al&s;o promi&s;e the &s;ame thing very &s;olemnly: And at fir&s;t he &s;eemed much &s;et upon it. But when he &s;aw &s;o great a Party formed again&s;t him&s;elf: And, &s;ince many of the Presbyterians inclined to favour them, and to &s;et them&s;elves in an oppo&s;ition to the Court, he thought it was the King's Intere&s;t, or at lea&s;t his own, to engage that Party entirely: And he found nothing could do that &s;o effectually, as to abandon the Mini&s;ters of the Epi&s;copal Per&s;ua&s;ion to their fury. He &s;et up the Earl of <HI>Crawford,</HI> as the head of his Party; who was pa&s;&s;ionate in his temper, and was out of mea&s;ure zealous in his Principles: He was cho&s;en to be the Pre&s;ident of the Parliament. He received and encouraged all the complaints, that were made of the Epi&s;copal Mini&s;ters: The Convention, when they pa&s;&s;ed the Votes, declaring the King and Queen, order'd a Proclamation to be read the next Sunday, in all the Churches of <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> and in all the other Churches in the Kingdom, by a certain prefixed day; but which was &s;o near at hand, that it was &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to lay Proclamations, all round the Nation, within the time; and it was ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible for the Clergy to meet together, and come to any re&s;olution among them&s;elves: For the mo&s;t part, the Proclamations were not brought to the Mi|ni&s;ters till the morning of the Sunday, in which they were ordered to be read; &s;o, this having the face of a great change of Principles, many could not on the &s;udden re&s;olve to &s;ubmit to it: Some had not the Proclamations brought to them till the day was pa&s;t; Many of the&s;e read it the Sunday following. Some of
<PB N="30" REF="51">
tho&s;e, who did not think fit to read the Proclamation, yet obeyed it; and continued, after that, to pray for the King and Queen. Complaints were brought to the Council of all tho&s;e, who had not read nor obeyed the Proclamation; And they were in a &s;ummary way deprived of their Benefices. In the executing this, Lord <HI>Crawford</HI> &s;hewed much eagerne&s;s and violence. Tho&s;e who did not read the Proclamation on the day appointed, had no favour, tho' they did it afterwards. And upon any word that fell from them, either in their extemporary Prayers, or Sermons, that &s;hewed di&s;affection to the Government, they were al&s;o deprived: All the&s;e things were publi&s;hed up and down <HI>England,</HI> and much aggravated: And rai&s;ed the aver&s;ion, that the friends of the Church had to the Presbyterians &s;o high, that they began to repent their having granted a Toleration to a Party, that, where They prevailed, &s;hewed &s;o much fury again&s;t tho&s;e of the Epi&s;copal Per&s;ua&s;ion. So that &s;uch of us, as had laboured to excu&s;e the change, that the King was forced to con&s;ent to, and had promi&s;ed in his Name, great Modera|tion towards our friends in that Kingdom, were much out of countenance, when we &s;aw the Violence with which matters were carried there. The&s;e things concurred to give the Clergy &s;uch ill impre&s;&s;ions of the King, that we had little rea&s;on to look for &s;ucce&s;s, in a de&s;ign that was then preparing for the Convocation, for whom a Summons was i&s;&s;ued out to meet, dur|ing the next Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament.</P>
<P>It was told, in the Hi&s;tory of the former Reign, that the Clergy <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Compre+hen&s;ion on deavoured.</NOTE> did then expre&s;s an inclination, to come to a temper with relation to the Presbyterians, and &s;uch other Di&s;&s;enters as could be brought into a Comprehen&s;ion with the Church: The Bi&s;hops had men|tioned it in the Petition to King <HI>James,</HI> for which they were tried; And his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty had promi&s;ed, to endeavour an Union between the Church and the Di&s;&s;enters, in that Declara|tion, that he brought over with him: But it &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary to prepare and dige&s;t that matter carefully, before it &s;hould be offered to the Convocation. Things of &s;uch a nature ought to be judged of by a large number of Men; but mu&s;t be pre|pared by a &s;maller number well cho&s;en: Yet it was thought a due re&s;pect to the Church, to leave the matter wholly in the hands of the Clergy. So, by a &s;pecial Commi&s;&s;ion under the Great Seal, Ten Bi&s;hops and Twenty Divines were empowered to meet, and prepare &s;uch Alterations, in the Book of Com|mon-Prayer and Canon, as might be &s;it to lay before the Con|vocation. This was become nece&s;&s;ary, &s;ince by the Submi&s;&s;ion, which the Clergy in Convocation made to King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII, which
<PB N="31" REF="52">
was confirmed in Parliament, they bound them&s;elves not to at|tempt any new Canons, without obtaining the King's leave fir&s;t, and that under the pains of a <HI>Premunire.</HI> It was looked on there|fore, as the propere&s;t way, to obtain the King's leave, to have a Scheme of the whole matter put in order, by a number of Bi&s;hops and Divines: Great care was taken to name the&s;e &s;o impartially, that no exceptions could lie again&s;t any of them: They, upon this, &s;ate clo&s;ely to it, for &s;everal weeks: They had before them all the Exceptions, that either the Puritans before the War, or the Nonconformi&s;ts &s;ince the Re&s;toration, had made to any part of the Church-Service: They had al&s;o many Propo&s;itions and Advices that had been offered, at &s;everal times, by many of our Bi&s;hops and Divines, upon tho&s;e heads: Matters were well con|&s;idered, and freely and calmly debated: And all was dige&s;ted into an entire Correction of every thing, that &s;eemed liable to any ju&s;t objection: We had &s;ome very rigid, as well as very learned men among us; tho' the mo&s;t rigid, either never came to our Meetings, or they &s;oon withdrew from us, declaring them|&s;elves di&s;&s;atified with every thing of that nature; &s;ome telling us plainly, that they were again&s;t all alterations what&s;oever. They thought, too much was already done for the Di&s;&s;enters, in the Toleration that was granted them; but that they would do nothing to make that &s;till ea&s;ier. They &s;aid further, that the altering the Cu&s;toms and Con&s;titution of our Church, to gratify a peevi&s;h and ob&s;tinate Party, was like to have no other effect on them, but to make them more in&s;olent; as if the Church, by offering the&s;e Alterations, &s;eemed to confe&s;s that &s;he had been hitherto in the wrong. They thought, this attempt would divide us among our &s;elves, and make our People lo&s;e their e&s;teem for the Liturgy, if it appeared that it wanted Correction. They al&s;o excepted to the manner of preparing matters, by a &s;pe|cial Commi&s;&s;ion, as limiting the Convocation, and impo&s;ing upon it: And to load this with a word of an ill &s;ound, they called this a new Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Commi&s;&s;ion. But in an&s;wer to all this, it was &s;aid; that, if by a few Corrections or Explana|tions, we offered all ju&s;t &s;atisfaction to the chief Objections of the Di&s;&s;enters, we had rea&s;on to hope, that this would bring over many of them, at lea&s;t of the People, if not of the Teach|ers among them; or, if the prejudices of education wrought too &s;trongly upon the pre&s;ent Age, yet, if &s;ome more &s;en&s;ible ob|jections were put out of the way, we might well hope, that it would have a great effect on the next generation. If the&s;e conde&s;cen&s;ions were made &s;o, as to own, in the way of offering them, that the Nonconformi&s;ts had been in the right, that might
<PB N="32" REF="53">
turn to the reproach of the Church: But, &s;uch offers being made only, in regard to their weakne&s;s, the reproach fell on them; as the honour accrued to the Church, who &s;hewed her &s;elf a true Mother, by her care to pre&s;erve her Children. It was not offered, that the ordinary po&s;ture, of receiving the Sa|crament kneeling, &s;hould be changed: That was &s;till to be the received and favoured po&s;ture: Only &s;uch, as declared they could not overcome their &s;cruples in that matter, were to be admitted to it in another po&s;ture. Ritual matters were of their own nature indifferent, and had been always declared to be &s;o: All the nece&s;&s;ity of them aro&s;e only, from the authority in Church and State, that had enacted them. Therefore it was an unrea&s;onable &s;tiffne&s;s, to deny any abatement, or yield|ing in &s;uch matters, in order to the healing the wounds of our Church. Great alterations had been made in &s;uch things, in all the Ages of the Church. Even the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> was &s;till making &s;ome alterations in her Rituals. And changes had been made among our &s;elves, often &s;ince the Reformation, in King <HI>Edward,</HI> Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> King <HI>James,</HI> and King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second's reigns. The&s;e were always made upon &s;ome great turn: Critical times being the mo&s;t proper for de&s;igns of that kind. The Toleration, now granted, &s;eemed to render it more nece&s;&s;ary than formerly, to make the terms of Communion, with the Church, as large as might be; that &s;o we might draw over to us the greater number, from tho&s;e who might now leave us more &s;afely: And therefore we were to u&s;e the more care in order to gaining of them. And, as for the manner of preparing the&s;e overtures, the King's Supremacy &s;ignify'd little, if he could not appoint a &s;elect number to con&s;ider of &s;uch matters, as he might think fit to lay before the Convocation. This did no way break in upon their full freedom of Debate; it being free to them to reject, as well as to accept, of the Pro+po&s;itions that &s;hould be offered to them. But, while men were arguing this matter on both &s;ides, the Party that was now at work for King <HI>James,</HI> took hold of this occa&s;ion to enflame mens minds. It was &s;aid, the Church was to be pulled down, and Presbytery was to be &s;et up; that all this now in Debate was only intended to divide and di&s;tract the Church, and to render it, by that means, both weaker and more ridiculous, while it went off from its former grounds, in offering &s;uch conce&s;&s;ions. The Univer&s;ities took fire upon this; and began to declare again&s;t it, and again&s;t all that promoted it, as men that in|tended to undermine the Church: Severe Reflections were must on the King, as being in an Intere&s;t contrary to the
<PB N="33" REF="54">
Church: For the Church was as the word given out by the Ja|cobite Party, under which they thought they might more &s;afely &s;helter them&s;elves: Great canva&s;&s;ings were every where, in the Elections of Convocation-Men; a thing not known in former times: So that it was &s;oon very vi&s;ible, that we were not in a temper, cool or calm enough, to encourage the further pro&s;ecut|ing &s;uch a de&s;ign.</P>
<P>When the Convocation was opened, the King &s;ent them a <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Convoca|tion met, but would not agree to it</NOTE> Me&s;&s;age by the Earl of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> a&s;&s;uring them of his con|&s;tant Favour and Protection, and de&s;iring them to con&s;ider &s;uch things, as by his order &s;hould be laid before them, with due care, and an impartial zeal for the peace and good of the Church. But the Lower Hou&s;e of Convocation expre&s;&s;ed a re&s;olution not to enter into any Debates with relation to alterations: So that they would take no notice of the &s;econd part of the King's Me&s;&s;age: And it was, not without difficulty, carried to make a decent Addre&s;s to the King, thanking him for his Promi&s;e of Protection. But becau&s;e, in the draught which the Bi&s;hops &s;ent them, they acknowledged the Protection that the Prote&s;tant Religion in ge|neral, and the Church of <HI>England</HI> in particular, had received from him, the lower Hou&s;e thought, that this imported their owning &s;ome common Union with the foreign Prote&s;tants: So they would not agree to it. There was at this time but a &s;mall number of Bi&s;hops in the upper Hou&s;e of Convocation: And they had not their Metropolitan with them: So they had not &s;trength nor authority to &s;et things forward. Therefore they advi&s;ed the King to &s;uffer the Se&s;&s;ion to be di&s;continued. And thus, &s;eeing they were in no di&s;po&s;ition to enter upon bu&s;ine&s;s, they were kept from doing mi&s;chief by Prorogations, for a cour&s;e of ten years. This was in reality a favour to them; for, ever &s;ince the year 1662, the Convocation had indeed continued to &s;it, but to do no bu&s;ine&s;s; &s;o that they were kept at no &s;mall charge in Town to do nothing, but only to meet, and read a Latin Litany. It was therefore an ea&s;e, to be freed from &s;uch an at|tendance to no purpo&s;e. The ill reception, that the Clergy gave the King's me&s;&s;age, rai&s;ed a great and ju&s;t out-cry again&s;t them: Since all the promi&s;es made in King <HI>James</HI>'s time were now &s;o entirely forgot.</P>
<P>But there was a very happy direction of the Providence of God ob&s;erved in this matter. The Jacobite Clergy, who were then under Su&s;pen&s;ion, were de&s;igning to make a Schi&s;m in the Church, when&s;oever they &s;hould be turned out, and their places &s;hould be filled up by others. They &s;aw, it would not be ea&s;y to make a Separation upon a private and per&s;onal account;
<PB N="34" REF="55">
They therefore wi&s;hed to be furni&s;hed with more &s;pecious pre|tences: And, if we had made alterations in the Rubrick, and other parts of the Common-Prayer, they would have pretended, that they &s;till &s;tuck to the Ancient Church of <HI>England,</HI> in op|po&s;ition to tho&s;e who were altering it, and &s;etting up new mo|dels: And, as I do firmly believe that there is a wi&s;e Provi|dence, that watches upon human affairs, and directs them, chiefly tho&s;e that relate to Religion; &s;o I have with great plea|&s;ure ob&s;erved this, in many in&s;tances relating to the Revolution. And, upon this occa&s;ion, I could not but &s;ee, that the Jacobites among us, who wi&s;hed and hoped that we &s;hould have made tho&s;e Alterations, which they reckoned would have been of great advantage for &s;erving their ends, were the in&s;truments of rai&s;ing &s;uch a clamour again&s;t them, as prevented their be|ing made. For by all the judgments we could afterwards make, if we had carried a Majority in the Convocation for alterations, they would have done us more hurt than good.</P>
<P>I now turn to a more important, as well as a more trouble|&s;ome <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament.</NOTE> &s;cene. In Winter, a Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament met, full of jealou&s;y and ill humour. The ill conduct of affairs was im|puted chiefly to the Lord <HI>Halifax;</HI> &s;o the fir&s;t attack was made on him. The Duke of <HI>Bolton</HI> made a motion in the Hou&s;e of Lords, for a Committee to examine, who had the chief hand in the Severities and Executions in the end of King <HI>Charles</HI>'s reign, and in the <HI>Quo Warranto's,</HI> and the delivering up the Charters: The Enquiry la&s;ted &s;ome weeks, and gave occa&s;ion to much heat: But nothing appeared that could be proved, upon which Votes or Addre&s;&s;es could have been ground|ed: Yet the Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> having, during that time, concurred with the Mini&s;try in Council; he &s;aw, it was nece&s;&s;ary for him to withdraw now from the Mini&s;ters, and quit the Court. And &s;oon after he reconciled him&s;elf to the Tories, and be|came wholly theirs: He oppo&s;ed every thing that looked fa|vourably towards the Government, and did upon all occa&s;ions &s;erve the Jacobites, and protect the whole Party. But the Whigs began to lo&s;e much of the King's good opinion, by the heat that they &s;hewed in both Hou&s;es again&s;t their enemies; and by the coldne&s;s that appeared in every thing, that related to the Publick, as well as to the King in his own particular. He expre&s;&s;ed an earne&s;t de&s;ire to have the Revenue of the Crown &s;ettled on him for life: He &s;aid, he was not a King, till that was done; Without that, the title of a King was only a page|ant. And he &s;poke of this with more than ordinary vehemence: So that &s;ometimes he &s;aid, he would not &s;tay, and hold an
<PB N="35" REF="56">
empty name, unle&s;s that was done: He &s;aid once to my &s;elf, He under&s;tood the good of a Commonwealth, as well as of a Kingly Government: And it was not ea&s;y to determine, which <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King grew jealous of the Whigs.</NOTE> was be&s;t: But he was &s;ure, the wor&s;t of all Governments was, that of a King without Trea&s;ure, and without Power. But a jealou&s;y was now infu&s;ed into many, that he would grow Ar|bitrary in his Government, if he once had the Revenue; and would &s;train for a high &s;tretch of Prerogative, as &s;oon as he was out of difficulties and nece&s;&s;ities. Tho&s;e of the Whigs, who had lived &s;ome years at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> had got together a great many &s;tories, that went about the City, of his fullenne&s;s, and imperious way of dictating: The <HI>Scotch,</HI> who were now come up, to give an account of the proceedings in Parliament, &s;et about many things that heightned their apprehen&s;ions. One <HI>Simp&s;on,</HI> a <HI>Scotch</HI> Presbyterian, was recommended to the Earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> as a man whom he might tru&s;t; who would bring him good intelligence: So he was often admitted, and was entertained as a good Spy: But he was in a &s;ecret confidence with one <HI>Nevill Payne,</HI> the mo&s;t active and dextrous of all King <HI>James</HI>'s Agents, who had indeed lo&s;t the reputation of an hone&s;t man entirely: And yet had &s;uch arts of manage|ment, that even tho&s;e who knew what he was, were willing to employ him. <HI>Simp&s;on</HI> and he were in a clo&s;e League together; And he di&s;covered &s;o much of their &s;ecrete&s;t intelligence to <HI>Simp&s;on,</HI> that he might carry it to the Earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> as made him pa&s;s for the be&s;t Spy the Court had. When he had gain|ed great credit, he made u&s;e of it to infu&s;e into the Earl of <HI>Portland</HI> jealou&s;ies of the King's be&s;t friends; And, as the Earl of <HI>Portland</HI> hearkned too attentively to the&s;e, &s;o by other hands it was conveyed to &s;ome of them, that the Court was now become jealous of them, and was &s;eeking Evidence again&s;t them.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>James Montgomery</HI> was ea&s;ily po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the&s;e reports; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;piracy again&s;t the Govern|ment.</NOTE> and he and &s;ome others, by <HI>Payne</HI>'s management, fell a treat|ing with King <HI>James</HI>'s Party in <HI>England:</HI> They demanded an a&s;&s;urance for the &s;ettlement of Presbytery in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to have the chief Po&s;ts of the Government &s;hared among them: Princes in exile are apt to grant every thing that is asked of them; for they know that, if they are re&s;tored, they will have every thing in their power: Upon this, they entred into a clo&s;e Treaty, for the way of bringing all this about. At fir&s;t they only asked money, for furni&s;hing them&s;elves with Arms and Ammunition; But afterwards they in&s;i&s;ted on demanding 3000 men, to be &s;ent over from <HI>Dunkirk;</HI> becau&s;e, by Duke <HI>Schom|berg</HI>'s
<PB N="36" REF="57">
being po&s;ted in <HI>Ul&s;ter,</HI> their communication with <HI>Ire|land</HI> was cut off. In order to the carrying on this de&s;ign, they reconciled them&s;elves to the Duke of <HI>Queensbury,</HI> and the other Lords of the Epi&s;copal party; And on both &s;ides it was given out, that this Union of tho&s;e, who were formerly &s;uch violent Enemies, was only to &s;ecure and &s;trengthen their Intere&s;t in Parliament: The Epi&s;copal Party pretending, that &s;ince the King was not able to protect them, they, who &s;aw them&s;elves mark|ed out for de&s;truction, were to be excu&s;ed for joining with tho&s;e, who could &s;ecure them. <HI>Simp&s;on</HI> brought an account of all this to the Earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> and was pre&s;&s;ed by him to find out witne&s;&s;es to prove it again&s;t <HI>Montgomery:</HI> He carried this to them, and told them, that the whole bu&s;ine&s;s was di&s;|covered, and that great Rewards were offered to &s;uch, as would merit them by &s;wearing again&s;t them. With this they alarm|ed many of their Party, who did not know what was at bot|tom, and thought that nothing was de&s;igned, but an oppo&s;i|tion to Lord <HI>Melvill</HI> and Lord <HI>Stair;</HI> And they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a fear, that a new bloody &s;cene of Sham-plots and &s;uborn|ed Witne&s;&s;es was to be opened. And when it began to be whi&s;pered about, that they were in treaty with King <HI>James,</HI> that appeared to be &s;o little credible, that it began to be &s;aid, by &s;ome di&s;contented men, What could be expected from a Government, that was &s;o &s;oon contriving the ruine of its be&s;t Friends? Some feared, that the King him&s;elf might too ea&s;ily receive &s;uch Reports; and that the common practices of Mi|ni&s;ters, who &s;tudy to make their Ma&s;ters believe, that all their own enemies are likewi&s;e His, were like to prevail in this reign, as much as they had formerly done. <HI>Montgomery</HI> came to have great credit with &s;ome of the Whigs in <HI>England,</HI> par|ticularly with the Earl of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Bolton:</HI> And he employed it all, to per&s;uade them not to tru&s;t the King, and to animate them again&s;t the Earl of <HI>Portland:</HI> This wrought &s;o much, that many were di&s;po&s;ed to think, they could have good terms from King <HI>James:</HI> And, that he was now &s;o convinced of former errors, that they might &s;afely tru&s;t him. The Earl of <HI>Monmouth</HI> let this out to my &s;elf twice; but in a &s;train that looked like one who was afraid of it, and who endeavoured to prevent it: but he &s;et forth the rea&s;ons for it with great advantage, and tho&s;e again&s;t it very faintly. Matters were tru&s;ted to <HI>Montgomery</HI> and <HI>Payne;</HI> And <HI>Fergu&s;on</HI> was taken into it, as a man that naturally loved to embroil things. So, a de&s;ign was managed, fir&s;t to alienate the City of <HI>London</HI> &s;o entirely from the King, that no Loans might be

advanced on the Money Bills; which, without credit upon them, could not an&s;wer the end, for which they were given. It was &s;et about, that King <HI>James</HI> would give a full Indemnity, for all that was pa&s;t; and that, for the future, he would &s;e|parate him&s;elf entirely from the <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;t, and be content|ed with a &s;ecret connivance at tho&s;e of his own Religion. It was &s;aid, he was weary of the In&s;olence of the <HI>French</HI> Court, and &s;aw his error, in tru&s;ting to it &s;o much as he had done. This corrupted Party had gone &s;o far, that they &s;eemed to fancy, that the re&s;toring him would be not only &s;afe, but hap|py to the Nation. I confe&s;s, it was long before I could let my &s;elf think, that the matter was gone &s;o far; But I was at la&s;t convinced of it.</P>
<P>I received a Letter from an unknown hand, with a direction <NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;covered to the $u|thor.</NOTE> how to an&s;wer it: The &s;ub&s;tance of it was, that he could di&s;|cover a Plot, deeply laid again&s;t the King, if he might, a&s;|&s;ured not to be made a Witne&s;s; and to have his friends, who were in it, pardoned: By the King's order, I promi&s;ed the fir&s;t; But an indefinite promi&s;e of Pardon, was too much to ask: He might, as to that, tru&s;t to the King's mercy. Upon this he came to me, and I found he was <HI>Montgomery</HI>'s Brother: He told me a Treaty was &s;ettled with King <HI>James;</HI> Articles were agreed on; And an Invitation was &s;ub&s;cribed, by the whole Ca|bal, to King <HI>James</HI> to come over: Which was to be &s;ent to the Court of <HI>France;</HI> both becau&s;e the Communication was ea&s;ier, and le&s;s watched, when it went thro' <HI>Flanders,</HI> than with <HI>Ire|land;</HI> And, to let the Court &s;ee how &s;trange a Party he had, and by that means to obtain the Supplies and Force that was de&s;ired. He &s;aid, he &s;aw the writing, and &s;ome hands to it; but he knew many more were to &s;ign it; And he undertook to put me in a method to &s;eize on the Original Paper. The King could not ea&s;ily believe the matter had gone &s;o far; Yet he ordered the Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> to receive &s;uch advices, as I &s;hould bring him, and immediately to do what was proper: So a few days after this, <HI>Montgomery</HI> told me, one <HI>William&s;on</HI> was that day gone to <HI>Dover,</HI> with the original Invitation: I found the Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> inclined enough to &s;u&s;pect <HI>Wil|liam&s;on.</HI> He had for &s;ome days &s;olicited a Pa&s;s for <HI>Flanders,</HI> and had got &s;ome per&s;ons, of whom it was not proper to &s;hew a Su&s;picion, to an&s;wer for him. So one was &s;ent Po&s;t after him, with orders to &s;eize him in his bed, and to take his Clothes and Portmanteau from him, which were &s;trictly examined; But nothing was found: Yet, upon the news of this, the Party was grievou&s;ly affrighted; But &s;oon recovered them&s;elves: The true

&s;ecret of which was afterwards di&s;covered. <HI>Simp&s;on</HI> was it &s;eems to go over with <HI>William&s;on;</HI> but fir&s;t to ride to &s;ome Hou&s;es that were in the way to <HI>Dover;</HI> whereas the other went directly in the Stage-Coach. It was thought &s;afe&s;t for <HI>Simp&s;on</HI> to carry the&s;e Papers; for there were many different Invita|tions, as they would not tru&s;t their hands to one common pa|per: <HI>Simp&s;on</HI> came to the Hou&s;e at <HI>Dover,</HI> where <HI>William&s;on</HI> was in the Me&s;&s;engers hands: Thereupon he went away immediately to <HI>Deal,</HI> and hired a boat, and got &s;afe to <HI>France</HI> with his Letters. <HI>Mortgomery,</HI> finding that nothing was di&s;covered, by the way which he had directed me to, upon that fancied he would be de&s;pi&s;ed by us, and perhaps &s;u&s;pected by his own &s;ide; And went over &s;oon after, and turned Papi&s;t: But I know not what became of him afterwards. The fear of this Di&s;covery &s;oon went off: <HI>Simp&s;on</HI> came back with large a&s;&s;urances: And 12000 Pounds were &s;ent to the <HI>Scotch,</HI> who undertook to do great matters. All pretended Di&s;coveries were laughed at, and looked on as the fictions of the Court: And upon this, the City of <HI>London</HI> were generally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a very ill opinion of the King. The Hou&s;e of Commons granted the Supplies, that were demanded for the Reduction of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and for the <HI>Quota,</HI> to which the King was obliged by his Al|liances: And they continued the gift of the Revenue for ano|ther year. But one great error was committed by the Court, in accepting remote Funds; whereby the Intere&s;t of the money, then advanced on a Funds, payable at the di&s;tance of &s;ome years, did not only eat up a great deal of the Sum, but &s;eemed &s;o doubtful, that great Premiums were to be offered to tho&s;e, who advanced money upon a Security, which was thought very contingent; &s;ince few believed that the Government would la&s;t &s;o long. So here was a &s;hew of great Supplies, which yet brought not in the half of what they were e&s;timated at.</P>
<P>The Tories, &s;eeing the $span$gs grow &s;ullen, and that they <NOTE PLACE="marg">$para$.</NOTE> would make no advances of money, began to treat with the Court, and promi&s;ed great advances, if the Parliament might be di&s;&s;olved, and a new one be &s;ummoned. Tho&s;e propo&s;i|tions came to be known; &s;o the Hou&s;e of Commons prepared a Bill, by which they hoped to have made &s;ure of all future Parliaments; In it they declared, that Corporations could not be $span$ed, nor their $word$ $word$; And they enacted, that all $word$ and $word$, who had been concerned in the private $span$, without the con&s;ent of the whole Body, and $span$ done that in a $span$ande&s;tine man|ner, before the Judg$span$ given again&s;t the Charte$
<PB N="39" REF="60">
of <HI>London,</HI> &s;hould be turned out of all Corporations, and be incapable of bearing Office in them for Six years. This was oppo&s;ed in the Hou&s;e of Commons, by the whole &s;trength of the Tory Party; for they &s;aw the carrying it was the total ru|ine of their Intere&s;t, thro' the whole Kingdom. They &s;aid a great deal again&s;t the declaratory part; But what&s;oever might be in that, they &s;aid, &s;ince the thing had been &s;o univer&s;al, it &s;eemed hard to puni&s;h it with &s;uch Severity: It was &s;aid, that by this means, the Party for the Church would be di&s;graced, and that the Corporations would be ca&s;t into the hands of Di&s;&s;enters. And now both Parties made their court to the King; The Whigs promi&s;ed every thing that he de&s;ired, if he would help them to get this Bill pa&s;&s;ed; And the Tories were not wanting in their promi&s;es, if the Bill &s;hould be &s;topp'd, and the Parliament di&s;&s;olved. The Bill was carried in the Hou&s;e of Commons by a great Majority: When it was brought up to the Lords, the fir&s;t point in debate was, upon the declaratory part, Whether a Corporation could be forfeited or &s;urrendred; <HI>Holt,</HI> and two other Judges, were for the Affirmative, but all the re&s;t were for the Negative: No Precedents for the Affirma|tive were brought, higher than the reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII, in which the Abbies were &s;urrendred; which was at that time &s;o great a point of State, that the authority of the&s;e Precedents &s;eemed not clear enough for regular times: The hou&s;e was &s;o equally divided, that it went for the Bill only by one Voice: After which, little doubt was made of the pa&s;&s;ing the Act. But now the applications of the Tories were much quickned; They made the King all po&s;&s;ible promi&s;es: And the promoters of the Bill &s;aw them&s;elves expo&s;ed to the Corporations, which were to feel the effects of this Bill, &s;o &s;en&s;ibly, that they made as great promi&s;es on their part: The matter was new at a cri|tical i&s;&s;ue; The pa&s;&s;ing the Bill put the King and the Nation in the hands of the Whigs; as the $span$ing it, and di&s;&s;olving the Parliament upon it, was &s;uch a tru&s;ting to the Tories, and &s;uch a breaking with the Whigs, that the King was long in &s;u&s;|pence what to do.</P>
<P>He was once very near a de&s;perate re&s;olution; He thought, he could not tru&s;t the Tories, and he $word$ he would not tru&s;t the Whigs; So he fancied, the Tories would be true to the Queen, and confide in her, tho' they would not in him. He therefore re&s;olved to go over to <HI>Holland,</HI> and leave the Govern|ment in the Queen's hands: So he called the Mar$$i&s;s of <HI>C$span$|marthen,</HI> with the $word$ of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> and &s;ome few more, and told them, he had a Convoy ready, and was $$$lved to
<PB N="40" REF="61">
leave all in the Queen's hands; &s;ince he did not &s;ee how he could extricate him&s;elf out of the difficulties, into which the animo|&s;ities of Parties had brought him: They pre&s;&s;ed him vehement|ly to lay a&s;ide all &s;uch de&s;perate re&s;olutions, and to comply with the pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ity; Much pa&s;&s;ion appeared among them: The Debate was &s;o warm, that many tears were &s;hed; In con|clu&s;ion, the King re&s;olved to change his fir&s;t De&s;ign, into ano|ther better Re&s;olution of going over in per&s;on, to put an end to the War in <HI>Ireland:</HI> This was told me &s;ome time after by the Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury;</HI> But the Queen knew nothing of it, till &s;he had it from me; So re&s;erved was the King to her, even in a matter that concerned her &s;o nearly. The King's de&s;ign, of going to <HI>Ireland,</HI> came to be &s;een by the Preparations, that were ordered; But a great Party was formed in both Hou&s;es to oppo&s;e it: Some did really apprehend the air of <HI>Ireland</HI> would be fatal to &s;o weak a Con&s;titution; And the Jacobites had no mind that King <HI>James</HI> &s;hould be &s;o much pre&s;&s;ed, as he would probably be, if the King went again&s;t him in per&s;on: It was by concert propo&s;ed in both Hou&s;es, on the &s;ame day, to pre|pare an Addre&s;s to the King again&s;t this Voyage: So the King, to prevent that, came the next day, and prorogued the Parlia|ment; and that was &s;oon after followed by a Di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>This Se&s;&s;ion had not rai&s;ed all the money, that was demand|ed for the following Campaign; So it was nece&s;&s;ary to i&s;&s;ue out <NOTE PLACE="marg">1690 A new Par|liament.</NOTE> Writs immediately for a new Parliament. There was a great Struggle all <HI>England</HI> over in Elections; But the Corporation Bill did &s;o highly provoke all tho&s;e, whom it was to have di&s;graced, that the Tories were by far the greater number in the new Parliament. One thing was a part of the Bargain, that the Tories had made, that the Lieutenancy of <HI>London</HI> &s;hould be changed: For upon the King's coming to the Crown, he had given a Commi&s;&s;ion, out of which they were all excluded; which was &s;uch a Mortification to them, that they &s;aid, they could not live in the City with credit, unle&s;s &s;ome of them were again brought into that Commi&s;&s;ion: The King recom|mended it to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> to prepare a Li&s;t of tho&s;e, who were known to be Churchmen, but of the more moderate, and of &s;uch as were liable to no ju&s;t exception; that &s;o the two Parties in the City might be kept in a Balance: The Bi|&s;hop brought a Li&s;t of the mo&s;t violent Tories in the City, who had been engaged in &s;ome of the wor&s;t things, that pa&s;&s;ed in the end of King <HI>Charles</HI>'s Reign: A Committee of Council was appointed to examine the Li&s;t; But it was &s;o named, that
<PB N="41" REF="62">
they approved of it. This was done to the great grief of the Whigs, who &s;aid, that the King was now putting him&s;elf in his Enemies hands; and that the Arms of the City were now put under a &s;ett of Officers, who, if there was a po&s;&s;ibility of doing it without hazard, would certainly u&s;e them for King <HI>James.</HI> This matter was managed by the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Caermarthen,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Nottingham;</HI> but oppo&s;ed by the Earl of <HI>Shrew&s;|bury,</HI> who was much troubled at the ill conduct of the Whigs, but much more at this great change in the King's Government. The Elections of Parliament went generally for men, who would probably have declared for King <HI>James,</HI> if they could have known how to manage matters for him. The King made a change in the Mini&s;try, to give them &s;ome &s;atisfaction; The Earls of <HI>Monmouth</HI> and <HI>Warrington</HI> were both di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; Other le&s;&s;er changes were made in inferior places: So that Whig and Tory were now pretty equally mixed; And both &s;tudied to court the King, by making advances upon the Money Bills.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t great Debate aro&s;e, in the Hou&s;e of Lords, upon a <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Bill re|cognizing the King, Queen, and the Acts of the Conven|tion.</NOTE> Bill that was brought in, acknowledging the King and Queen to be their Rightful and Lawful Sovereigns; and declaring all the Acts of the la&s;t Parliament to be good and valid. The fir&s;t part pa&s;&s;ed, with little contradiction; tho' &s;ome excepted to the words <HI>Rightful</HI> and <HI>Lawful,</HI> as not at all nece&s;&s;ary. But the &s;econd Article bore a long and warm Debate. The Tories of|fered to enact, that the&s;e &s;hould be all good Laws, for the time to come, but oppo&s;ed the doing it in the declaratory way. They &s;aid, it was one of the Fundamentals of our Con&s;titution, that no A&s;&s;embly could be called a Parliament, unle&s;s it was called and cho&s;en upon the King's Writ. On the other hand it was &s;aid, that what&s;oever tended to the calling the authority of that Parliament in que&s;tion, tended likewi&s;e to the weakning of the pre&s;ent Government, and brought the King's Title into que&s;tion. A real nece&s;&s;ity, upon &s;uch extraordinary occa&s;ions, mu&s;t &s;uper|&s;ede Forms of Law: Otherwi&s;e the pre&s;ent Government was under the &s;ame Nullity. Forms were only Rules for peaceable times: But, in &s;uch a juncture, when all that had a right to come, either in per&s;on, or by their Repre&s;entatives, were &s;um|moned, and freely elected; and when, by the King's Con&s;ent, the Convention was turned to a Parliament, the e&s;&s;entials, both with relation to King and People, were &s;till maintained in the Con&s;titution of that Parliament. After a long debate, the Act pa&s;&s;ed in the Hou&s;e of Lords, with this temper, declaring and enacting, that the Acts of that Parliament were and are good and valid: Many Lords prote&s;ting again&s;t it, at the head of whom
<PB N="42" REF="63">
was the Earl of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> notwith&s;tanding his great Office at Court. It was expected, that great and long Debates &s;hould have been made in the Hou&s;e of Commons upon this Act. But, to the wonder of all People, it pa&s;&s;ed in two days in that Hou&s;e, without any Debate or Oppo&s;ition. The truth was, the Tories had re&s;olved to commit the Bill; and in order to that, &s;ome trifling exceptions were made to &s;ome words, that might want correction; for Bills are not committed, unle&s;s &s;ome amend|ments are offered: And, when it was committed, it was then re&s;olved to oppo&s;e it. But one of them di&s;covered this too early; for he que&s;tioned the Legality of the Convention, &s;ince it was not &s;ummoned by Writ: <HI>Somers,</HI> then Solicitor General, an&s;wered this with great &s;pirit; He &s;aid, if that was not a Le|gal Parliament, they who were then met, and had taken the Oaths, enacted by that Parliament, were guilty of High Trea|&s;on; the Laws repealed by it were &s;till in force, &s;o they mu&s;t pre&s;ently return to King <HI>James;</HI> All the money levied, col|lected, and paid, by virtue of the Acts of that Parliament, made every one that was concerned in it highly criminal: This he &s;poke with much zeal, and &s;uch an a&s;cendant of Authority, that none was prepared to an&s;wer it; So the Bill pa&s;&s;ed with|out any more oppo&s;ition. This was a great &s;ervice, done in a very critical time, and contributed not a little to rai&s;e <HI>Somers</HI>'s character.</P>
<P>The Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Commons, Sir <HI>John Trevor,</HI> was a bold and dextrous man; and knew the mo&s;t effectual ways of recommending him&s;elf to every Government: He had been in great favour in King <HI>James</HI>'s time, and was made Ma&s;ter of the Rolls by him; And, if Lord <HI>Jefferies</HI> had &s;tuck at any thing, he was looked on as the man, likelie&s;t to have had the Great Seal: He now got him&s;elf to be cho&s;en Speaker, and was made Fir&s;t Commi&s;&s;ioner of the Great Seal: Being a Tory in principle, he undertook to manage that Party, provided he was furni&s;hed with &s;uch &s;ums of money, as might purcha&s;e &s;ome Votes; And by him began the practice of buying off men, in which hitherto the King had kept to &s;tricter rules. I took the liberty once to complain to the King of this method; He &s;aid, he hated it as much as any man could do; But he &s;aw, it was not po&s;&s;ible, con&s;idering the Corruption of the Age, to avoid it, unle&s;s he would endanger the whole.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of Commons gave the King the Cu&s;toms for five <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Reve|nue given for years.</NOTE> years, which they &s;aid made it a &s;urer Fund, for borrowing money upon, than if they had given it for life: The one was &s;ubject to accidents, but the other was more certain. They al&s;o
<PB N="43" REF="64">
continued the other branches of the Revenue for the &s;ame num|ber of years. It was much pre&s;&s;ed to have it &s;ettled for life; But it was taken up as a general maxim, that a Revenue for a certain and &s;hort term, was the be&s;t &s;ecurity that the Nation could have for frequent Parliaments. The King did not like this; He &s;aid to my &s;elf, why &s;hould they entertain a jealou&s;y of him, who came to &s;ave their Religion and Liberties; when they tru&s;ted King <HI>James</HI> &s;o much, who intended to de&s;troy both? I an&s;wered, they were not jealous of him, but of tho&s;e who might &s;ucceed him; And if he would accept of the Gift for a term of years, and &s;ettle the Precedent, he would be rec|koned the Deliverer of &s;ucceeding Ages, as well as of the pre|&s;ent; And, it was certain, that King <HI>James</HI> would never have run into tho&s;e Coun&s;els that ruined him, if he had obtained the Revenue only for a &s;hort term; which probably would have been done, if <HI>Argyle</HI>'s and <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s Inva&s;ions had not &s;o over-awed the Hou&s;e, that it would then have looked like being in a Con&s;piracy with them, to have oppo&s;ed the King's demand: I &s;aw the King was not plea&s;ed, tho' he was per|&s;uaded to accept of the Grant, thus made him. The Commons granted a Poll Bill, with &s;ome other Supplies, which they thought would an&s;wer all the occa&s;ions of that year: But as, what they gave, did not quite come up to what was demanded; So when the Supply was rai&s;ed, it came far &s;hort of what they e&s;timated it at. So that there were great Deficiencies to be taken care of, in every Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament: which run up every year, and made a great noi&s;e, as if the Nation was, thro mi&s;management, running into a great Arrear. An Act pa&s;&s;ed in this Se&s;&s;ion, putting the Admini&s;tration in the Queen, during the King's ab|&s;ence out of the Kingdom; but with this Provi&s;o, that the Orders which the King &s;ent &s;hould always take place. In all this Debate, the Queen &s;eemed to take no notice of the matter, nor of tho&s;e who had appeared for it, or again&s;t it: The Hou&s;e of Commons, to the great grief of the Whigs, made an Ad|dre&s;s to the King, thanking him for the Alterations he had made in the Lieutenancy of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>But the greate&s;t Debate in this Se&s;&s;ion, was concerning an <NOTE PLACE="marg">Debates for and again&s;t an Abjura+tion o King <HI>James.</HI></NOTE> Abjuration of King <HI>James;</HI> &s;ome of the Tories were at fir&s;t for it, as were all the Whigs: The Clergy were excepted out of it, to &s;often the oppo&s;ition that might be made; But &s;till the main body of the Tories declared, they would never take any &s;uch Oath; So they oppo&s;ed every &s;tep that was made in it, with a great copiou&s;ne&s;s of long and vehement arguing: They in&s;i&s;ted much on this; that when the Government was &s;ettled,
<PB N="44" REF="65">
Oaths were made to be the Ties of the Subject to it, and that all new Impo&s;itions were a Breach made on That, which might be called the Original Contract of the pre&s;ent Settlement: Things of that kind ought to be fixed and certain, and not mutable and endle&s;s; By the &s;ame rea&s;on, that the Abjuration was now propo&s;ed, another Oath might be prepared every year; and every Party, that prevailed in Parliament, would bring in &s;ome di&s;criminating Oath or Te&s;t, &s;uch as could only be taken by tho&s;e of their own &s;ide; And thus the largene&s;s and equality of Government would be lo&s;t, and contracted into a Faction. On the other &s;ide it was &s;aid, that this was only intended to be a &s;ecurity to the Government, during the War; For, in &s;uch a time it &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary, that all who were employed by the Government, &s;hould give it all po&s;&s;ible &s;ecurity: It was appa|rent, that the comprehen&s;ive Words in the Oaths of Allegiance had given occa&s;ion to much equivocation; Many who had ta|ken them having declared, which &s;ome had done in print, that they con&s;idered them&s;elves as bound by the Oaths, only while the King continued in peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; but not to a&s;&s;i&s;t or &s;upport his Title, if it was attacked or &s;haked; It was therefore nece&s;&s;ary, that men in publick Tru&s;ts &s;hould be brought under &s;tricter Ties. The Abjuration was debated in both Hou&s;es, at the &s;ame time; I concurred with tho&s;e that were for it. The Whigs pre&s;&s;ed the King to &s;et it forward; They &s;aid, every one who took it, would look on him&s;elf as impardonable, and &s;o would &s;erve him with the more Zeal and Fidelity; whereas tho&s;e, that thought the Right to the Crown was &s;till in King <HI>James,</HI> might perhaps &s;erve faithfully as long as the Government &s;tood firm; but, as they kept &s;till mea&s;ures with the other &s;ide, to whom they knew they would be always welcome, &s;o they would never act with that life and zeal, which the pre&s;ent &s;tate of affairs required. At the &s;ame time, the Tories were as earne&s;t in pre&s;&s;ing the King to &s;top the further progre&s;s of tho&s;e Debates: Much time was already lo&s;t in them; And it was evident, that much more mu&s;t be lo&s;t, if it was intended to carry it on, &s;ince &s;o many branches of this Bill, and incidents that aro&s;e upon the &s;ubject of it, would give occa&s;ion to much heat and wrangling: And it was a doubt, whether it would be carried, after all the time that mu&s;t be be&s;towed on it, or not: Tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed it would grow &s;ullen, and oppo&s;e every thing el&s;e that was mov|ed for the King's &s;ervice: And, if it &s;hould be carried, it would put the King again into the hands of the Whigs, who would immediately return to their old practices, again&s;t
<PB N="45" REF="66">
the Prerogative; And it would drive many into King <HI>James</HI>'s Party, who might otherwi&s;e &s;tick firm to the King, or at lea&s;t be Neutrals: The&s;e rea&s;ons prevailed with the King, to order an Intimation to be given in the Hou&s;e of Commons, that he de&s;ired they would let that Debate fall, and go to other mat|ters, that were more pre&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>This gave a new di&s;gu&s;t to the Whigs, but was very accep|table to the Tories; And it quickned the advances of Money upon the Funds that were given: It had indeed a very ill effect abroad; For both friends and enemies looked on it, as a &s;ign of a great decline in the King's Intere&s;t with his people: And the King's interpo&s;ing, to &s;top further Debates in the matter, was repre&s;ented, as an artifice only to &s;ave the affront of its be|ing rejected. The Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> was at the head of tho&s;e who pre&s;&s;ed the Abjuration mo&s;t; So, upon this change of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> left the Court.</NOTE> Coun&s;els, he thought, he could not &s;erve the King longer with reputation or &s;ucce&s;s: He &s;aw the Whigs, by u&s;ing the King ill, were driving him into the Tories; and he thought, the&s;e would &s;erve the King with more zeal, if he left his Po&s;t. The credit, that the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Caermarthen</HI> had gained, was not ea&s;y to him: So he re&s;olved to deliver up the Seals. I was the fir&s;t Per&s;on, to whom he di&s;covered this; And he had them in his hands, when he told me of it; Yet I prevailed with him not to go that night; He was in &s;ome heat. I had no mind, that the King &s;hould be &s;urpri&s;ed, by a thing of that kind; and I was afraid, that the Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> might have &s;aid &s;uch things to Him, as &s;hould have provoked him too much; So I &s;ent the King word of it. It troubled him more than, I thought, a thing of that &s;ort could have done; He lov|ed the Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury;</HI> And apprehended, that his leaving his &s;ervice at this time, might alienate the Whigs more entirely from him; For now they, who thought him before of too cold a Temper, when they &s;aw how firm he was, came to con&s;ider and tru&s;t him more than ever. The King &s;ent <HI>Tillot&s;on,</HI> and all tho&s;e, who had mo&s;t credit with the Earl, to divert him from his Re&s;olution: But all was to no purpo&s;e. The agitation of mind, that this gave him, threw him into a Fever, which al|mo&s;t co&s;t him his life. The King pre&s;&s;ed him to keep the Seals, till his return from <HI>Ireland,</HI> tho' he &s;hould not act as Secretary; But he could not be prevailed on. The Debate, for the Abjuration, la&s;ted longer in the Hou&s;e of Lords; it had &s;ome Variation, from that which was propo&s;ed in the Hou&s;e of Commons: and was properly an Oath of a &s;pecial Fidelity to the King, in oppo&s;ition to King <HI>James:</HI> The Tories offered, in Bar to
<PB N="46" REF="67">
this, a Negative Engagement, again&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;ting King <HI>James,</HI> or any of his In&s;truments, knowing them to be &s;uch, with &s;e|vere Penalties on &s;uch as &s;hould refu&s;e it. In oppo&s;ition to this, it was &s;aid, this was only an expedient to &s;ecure all King <HI>James</HI>'s Party, whatever &s;hould happen; &s;ince it left them the entire merit of being &s;till in his Intere&s;ts, and only re&s;trained them from putting any thing to hazard for him. The Hou&s;e was &s;o near an equality, in every Divi&s;ion, that what was gained in one Day, was lo&s;t in the next; And by the heat and length of tho&s;e Debates, the Se&s;&s;ion continued till <HI>June.</HI> A Bill, projected by the Tories, pa&s;&s;ed, relating to the City of <HI>London,</HI> which was intended, to change the hands that then governed it; But thro' the ha&s;te or weakne&s;s of tho&s;e who drew it, the Court of Aldermen was not comprehended in it; So, by this Act, the Government of the City was fixed in their hands: And they were generally Whigs. Many di&s;coveries were made of the practices from <HI>St. Germains</HI> and <HI>Ireland;</HI> But few were taken up upon them: And tho&s;e were too incon&s;iderable, to know more than, that many were provided with Arms and Ammunition, and that a method was projected, for bringing men together upon a call. And indeed things &s;eemed to be in a very ill di&s;po&s;ition, towards a fatal Turn.</P>
<P>The King was making all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te to open the Cam|paign, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's &s;en&s;e of Af|fairs.</NOTE> as &s;oon as things could be ready for it, in <HI>Ireland:</HI> The day before he &s;et out, he called me into his Clo&s;et; He &s;eemed to have a great weight upon his &s;pirits, from the &s;tate of his affairs, which was then very cloudy: He &s;aid, for his own part, he tru&s;ted in God, and would either go thro' with his bu&s;ine&s;s, or peri&s;h in it: He only pitied the poor Queen, re|peating that twice with great tenderne&s;s, and wi&s;hed, that tho&s;e who loved him, would wait much on her, and a&s;&s;i&s;t her: He lamented much the factions and the heats that were among us, and that the Bi&s;hops and Clergy, in&s;tead of allaying them, did rather foment and inflame them: But he was plea&s;ed to make an exception of my &s;elf: He &s;aid, the going to a Cam|paign was naturally no unplea&s;ant thing to him: He was &s;ure, he under&s;tood that better, than how to govern <HI>England:</HI> He added, that, tho' he had no doubt nor mi&s;tru&s;t of the cau&s;e he went on, yet the going again&s;t King <HI>James,</HI> in per&s;on, was hard upon him, &s;ince it would be a va&s;t trouble both to him|&s;elf and to the Queen, if he &s;hould be either killed or taken Pri&s;oner: He de&s;ired my Prayers, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed me, very deep|ly affected with all he had &s;aid.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="68">
I had a particular occa&s;ion to know, how tender he was of King <HI>James</HI>'s per&s;on, having learnt an in&s;tance of it from the fir&s;t hand: A propo&s;ition was made to the King, that a third <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's tenderne&s;s for King <HI>James</HI>'s Per&s;on.</NOTE> Rate Ship, well mann'd by a faithful Crew, and commanded by One, who had been well with King <HI>James,</HI> but was &s;uch a one as the King might tru&s;t, &s;hould &s;ail to <HI>Dublin,</HI> and de|clare for King <HI>James.</HI> The per&s;on, who told me this, offered to be the man, that &s;hould carry the me&s;&s;age to King <HI>James,</HI> (for he was well known to him) to invite him to come on Board, which he &s;eemed to be &s;ure he would accept of; and, when he was aboard, they &s;hould &s;ail away with him, and land him either in <HI>Spain</HI> or <HI>Italy,</HI> as the King &s;hould de&s;ire; and &s;hould have twenty thou&s;and Pounds to give him, when he &s;hould be &s;et a&s;hore: The King thought it was a well formed de&s;ign, and likely enough to &s;ucceed; But would not hearken to it: He &s;aid he would have no hand in Treachery: And King <HI>James</HI> would certainly carry &s;ome of his Guards, and of his Court aboard with him: And probably they would make &s;ome oppo&s;ition; And in the &s;truggle, &s;ome accident might happen to King <HI>James</HI>'s Per&s;on; In which he would have no hand. I acquainted the Queen with this; And I &s;aw in her a great tenderne&s;s for her Father's Per&s;on; And &s;he was much touched with the an&s;wer the King had made.</P>
<P>He had a quick pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Ireland,</HI> where matters had been <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King failed to <HI>Ireland.</HI></NOTE> kept, in the &s;tate they were in, all this Winter; <HI>Charlemont</HI> was reduced, which was the only place in <HI>Ul&s;ter,</HI> that was then left in King <HI>James</HI>'s hands. The King had a great Army; There were about 36,000 men, all in good plight, full of heart and zeal; He lo&s;t no time, but advanced in &s;ix days from <HI>Belfa&s;t,</HI> where he landed, to the River of <HI>Boyne,</HI> near <HI>Drogheda.</HI> King <HI>James</HI> had abandoned the Pa&s;&s;es, between <HI>Newry</HI> and <HI>Dundalk,</HI> which are &s;o &s;trait for &s;ome miles, that it had been ea&s;y to have di&s;puted every inch of ground; King <HI>James</HI> and his Court were &s;o much lifted up, with the news of the Debates in Parlia|ment, and of the di&s;tractions of the City of <HI>London,</HI> that they flattered them&s;elves with fal&s;e hopes, that the King dur&s;t not leave <HI>England,</HI> nor venture over to <HI>Ireland:</HI> He had been &s;ix days come, before King <HI>James</HI> knew any thing of it. Upon that, he immediately pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Boyne,</HI> and lay on the South &s;ide of it. His Army con&s;i&s;ted of 26,000 men; His Hor&s;e were good; And he had 5000 <HI>French</HI> Foot, for whom he had &s;ent over, in exchange, 5000 <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Foot. He held &s;ome Coun|cils of War, to con&s;ider what was fit to be done; whether he &s;hould make a &s;tand there, and put all to the deci&s;ion of a
<PB N="48" REF="69">
Battle, or if he &s;hould march off, and abandon that River, and by con&s;equence all the Country on to <HI>Dublin.</HI></P>
<P>All his Officers, both <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> who di&s;agreed al|mo&s;t <NOTE PLACE="marg">Advices given to King <HI>James.</HI></NOTE> in all their advices, yet agreed in this, that, tho' they had there a very advantageous Po&s;t to maintain, yet their Army be|ing &s;o much inferior, both in number, and in every thing el&s;e, they would put too much to hazard, if they &s;hould venture on a Battle. They therefore propo&s;ed the &s;trengthning their Garri&s;ons, and marching off to the <HI>Shannon</HI> with the Hor&s;e, and a &s;mall body of Foot, till they &s;hould &s;ee how matters went at Sea: For the <HI>French</HI> King had &s;ent them a&s;&s;urances, that he would, not only &s;et out a great Fleet, but that, as &s;oon as the Squadron that lay in the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Seas, to guard the Tran&s;|port Fleet, and to &s;ecure the King's pa&s;&s;age over, &s;hould &s;ail into the Channel, to join our Grand Fleet, he would then &s;end into the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Seas a Fleet of &s;mall Fregats and Privateers, to de&s;troy the King's Tran&s;ports. This would have been fatal, if it had taken effect; And the executing of it &s;eemed ea&s;y and certain. It would have &s;hut up the King within <HI>Ireland,</HI> till a new Tran&s;port Fleet could have been brought thither, which would have been the work of &s;ome months: So that <HI>England</HI> might have been lo&s;t, before he could have pa&s;&s;ed the Seas with his Army. And the de&s;truction of his Tran&s;ports mu&s;t have ruined his Army: For his Stores, both of Bread and Ammunition, were &s;till on Board; and they &s;ailed along the Coa&s;t, as he advanced on his march: Nor was there, in all that Coa&s;t, a &s;afe Port to cover and &s;ecure them. The King indeed reckoned, that by the time the Squadron, which lay in the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Seas, &s;hould be able to join the re&s;t of the Fleet, they would have advanced, as far as the Chops of the Channel, where they would guard both <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland:</HI> But things went far otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>The Queen was now in the Admini&s;tration. It was a new <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen in the Ad|mini&s;tration.</NOTE> &s;eene to her; She had, for above &s;ixteen months, made &s;o lit|tle figure in Bu&s;ine&s;s, that tho&s;e, who imagined, that every Woman of &s;en&s;e loved to be meddling, concluded that &s;he had a &s;mall proportion of it, becau&s;e &s;he lived &s;o ab&s;tracted from all Affair. Her behaviour was indeed very exemplary; She was exactly regular, both in her private and publick devotions: She was much in her clo&s;et, and read a great deal; She was of|ten bu&s;y at work, and &s;eemed to employ her time and thoughts, in any thing, rather than matters of State; Her conver&s;ation was lively and obliging; Every thing in her was ea&s;y and natural; She was &s;ingular in great Charities to the Poor; of
<PB N="49" REF="70">
whom, as there are always great numbers about Courts, &s;o the crouds of Per&s;ons of Quality, that had fled over from <HI>Ireland,</HI> drew from her liberal Supplies: All this was nothing to the Pub|lick. If the King talked with her of Affairs, it was in &s;o pri|vate a way, that few &s;eemed to believe it; The Earl of <HI>Shrews|bury</HI> told me, that the King had, upon many Occa&s;ions, &s;aid to him, that tho' he could not hit on the right way of plea&s;ing <HI>England,</HI> he was confident &s;he would; and that we &s;hould all be very happy under her. The King named a Cabinet Council of eight Per&s;ons, on who&s;e Advice &s;he was chiefly to rely; four of them were Tories, and four were Whigs: Yet the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Caermarthen</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> being of the fir&s;t &s;ort, who took mo&s;t upon them, and &s;eemed to have the greate&s;t credit, the Whigs were not &s;atisfied with the Nomination. The Queen balanced all things, with an extraordinary Temper; and became univer&s;ally beloved and admired by all about her.</P>
<P>Our concerns at Sea were then the chief thing to be looked to: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs at Sea.</NOTE> An unhappy Complement, of &s;ending a Fleet to convoy a Queen to <HI>Spain,</HI> proved almo&s;t fatal to us. They were &s;o long delay'd by contrary Winds, that a de&s;ign of blocking up <HI>Toulon,</HI> was lo&s;t by it. The great Ships, that lay there, had got out before our Fleet could reach the place. Our Squadron returned back, and went into <HI>Plymouth</HI> to refit there: and it was joined by that, which came from the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Seas. The&s;e two Squadrons con&s;i&s;ted of above thirty Ships of the line: The Earl of <HI>Torrington,</HI> that had the chief command, was a man of plea&s;ure, and did not make the ha&s;te that was nece&s;&s;ary, to go about and join them: Nor did the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet come over &s;o &s;oon as was promi&s;ed: So that our main Fleet lay long at <HI>Spithead.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> under|&s;tood, that our Fleets lay thus divided, and &s;aw the advantage of getting between them: So they came into the Channel, with &s;o fair a Wind, that they were near the I&s;le of <HI>Wight,</HI> before our Fleet had any advice, of their being within the Channel. The Earl of <HI>Torrington</HI> had no advice Boats out to bring him News; And tho' notice thereof was &s;ent po&s;t over Land, as &s;oon as the <HI>French</HI> came within the Channel, yet their Fleet &s;ailed as fa&s;t, as the Po&s;t could ride: But then the Wind turned upon them; otherwi&s;e they would, in all probability, have &s;urpri&s;ed us. But after this fir&s;t advantage, the Winds were always contrary to them, and favourable to us. So that the <HI>French</HI> Officers in <HI>Ire|land,</HI> had rea&s;on to look for that Fleet of &s;maller Ve&s;&s;els, which was promi&s;ed to be &s;ent, to de&s;troy the King's Tran&s;port Ships. And for the&s;e rea&s;ons, all King <HI>James</HI>'s Officers were again&s;t bringing the War, to &s;o &s;peedy a deci&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="71">
In oppo&s;ition to all their Opinions, King <HI>James</HI> him&s;elf was po&s;itive, that they mu&s;t &s;tay and defend the <HI>Boyne:</HI> If they marched off and abandoned <HI>Dublin,</HI> they would &s;o lo&s;e their reputation, that the people would leave them, and capitulate; It would al&s;o di&s;pirit all their Friends in <HI>England:</HI> Therefore he re&s;olved to maintain the Po&s;t he was in, and &s;eemed not a little plea&s;ed to think, that he &s;hould have one fair Battle for his Crown. He &s;poke of this with &s;o much &s;eeming plea&s;ure, that many about him apprehended, that he was weary of the &s;trug|gle, and even of Life, and longed to &s;ee an end of it at any rate: and they were afraid that he would play the Heroe a little too much. He had all the advantages he could de&s;ire: The River was deep, and ro&s;e very high with the Tide: There was a Mora&s;s to be pa&s;s'd, after the pa&s;&s;ing the River, and then a ri|&s;ing ground.</P>
<P>On the la&s;t of <HI>June,</HI> the King came to the Banks of the Ri|ver: And as he was riding along, and making a long &s;top in one <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Cannon Bail wound|ed the King.</NOTE> place, to ob&s;erve the Grounds, the Enemy did not lo&s;e their opportunity, but brought down two pieces of Cannon: And, with the fir&s;t firing, a Ball pa&s;&s;ed along the King's Shoulder, tore off &s;ome of his Cloaths, and about a hand-breadth of the Skin, out of which about a &s;poonful of Blood came. And that was all the harm it did him. It cannot be imagined, how much terror this &s;truck into all, that were about him: He him&s;elf &s;aid, it was nothing: Yet he was prevailed on to alight, till it was wa&s;hed, and a plai&s;ter put upon it, and immediately he mounted his Hor&s;e again, and rode about all the Po&s;ts of his Army: It was indeed nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hew him&s;elf every where, to take off the apprehen&s;ions, with which &s;uch an unu&s;ual accident filled his Soldiers. He continued that day, nineteen hours on hor&s;e|back: But upon his fir&s;t alighting from his hor&s;e, a De&s;erter had gone over to the Enemy with the news, which was carried quickly into <HI>France,</HI> where it was taken for granted, that he could not out-live &s;uch a Wound: So it ran over that Kingdom, that he was dead. And upon it, there were more publick rejoicings, than had been u&s;ual upon their greate&s;t Victories: Which gave that Court afterwards a va&s;t Confu&s;ion, when they knew that he was &s;till alive; and &s;aw, that they had rai&s;ed, in their own people, a high opinion of him, by this inhumane joy, when they believed him dead.</P>
<P>But, to return to the action of the <HI>Boyne:</HI> The King &s;ent a great body of Cavalry, to pa&s;s the River higher, while he re&s;olv|ed to pa&s;s it in the face of the Enemy: And the Duke of <HI>Schomberg</HI> was to pa&s;s it in a third place, a little below him. I
<PB N="51" REF="72">
will not enter into the particulars of that day's action, but leave that to Military men.</P>
<P>It was a compleat Victory: And tho&s;e, who were the lea&s;t di&s;po&s;|ed <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Battle of the <HI>Boyne.</HI></NOTE> to Flattery, &s;aid, it was almo&s;t wholly due to the King's Courage and Conduct. And, tho' he was a little &s;tiff by rea&s;on of his Wound, yet he was forced to quit his Hor&s;e in the Mora&s;s, and to go through it on foot: But he came up in time, to ride almo&s;t into every body of his Army: He charged in many different places; And nothing &s;tood before him. The <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Hor&s;e made &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance, but the Foot threw down their Arms, and ran away. The mo&s;t amazing Circum&s;tance was, that King <HI>James</HI> &s;taid all the while with his Guards, at a &s;afe di&s;tance, and never came into the places of Danger or of Action. But, when he &s;aw his Army was every where giving ground, was the fir&s;t that ran for it, and reached <HI>Dublin,</HI> before the action was quite over; for it was dark before the King for&s;ook the pur&s;uit of the <HI>Iri&s;h.</HI> His Hor&s;e and Dragoons were &s;o weary, with the fatigue of a long action, in a hot day, that they could not pur&s;ue far: nor was their Camp furni&s;hed with nece&s;&s;ary refre&s;hments, till next morning; for the King had marched fa&s;ter, than the waggons could po&s;&s;ibly follow. The Army of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> was &s;o entirely for&s;aken by their Officers, that the King thought they would have di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves, and &s;ubmitted; and that the fol|lowing them would have been a mere butchery, which was a thing he had always abhorred. The only allay to this Victory was the lo&s;s of the Duke of <HI>Schomberg:</HI> He pa&s;&s;ed the River in his Station, and was driving the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> before him, when a party of de&s;perate men &s;et upon him, as he was riding very carele&s;ly, with a &s;mall number about him. They charged, and in the di&s;|order of that Action he was &s;hot: But it could not be known by whom; for mo&s;t of all the Party was cut off. Thus that great man, like another <HI>Epaminondas,</HI> fell on the day, on which his &s;ide triumphed.</P>
<P>King <HI>James</HI> came to <HI>Dublin,</HI> under a very indecent Con&s;ter|nation; He &s;aid, all was lo&s;t; He had an Army in <HI>England,</HI> that could have fought, but would not: and now he had an Army, that would have fought, but could not. This was not very gratefully, nor decently &s;poken by him, who was among the fir&s;t that fled. Next morning he left <HI>Dublin;</HI> He &s;aid, too much Blood had been already &s;hed; It &s;eemed, God was with their Enemies; The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was a merciful Man; So he ordered tho&s;e, he left behind him, to &s;et the Pri&s;oners at li|berty, and to &s;ubmit to the Prince: He rode that day from <HI>Dublin</HI> to <HI>Duncannon</HI> Fort: But, tho' the place was con&s;idera|bly
<PB N="52" REF="73">
&s;trong, he would not tru&s;t to that, but lay aboard a <HI>French</HI> Ship, that anchored there, and had been provided, by his own &s;pecial directions to Sir <HI>Patrick Trant.</HI> His Courage &s;unk with his Affairs, to a degree, that amazed tho&s;e, who had known the former Parts of his Life. The <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Army was for&s;aken by their Officers for two days: If there had been a hot pur&s;uit, it would have put an end to the War of <HI>Ireland:</HI> But the King thought his fir&s;t care ought to be to &s;ecure <HI>Dublin:</HI> And King <HI>James</HI>'s Officers, as they abandoned it, went back to the Army, only in hopes of a good Capitulation. <HI>Dublin</HI> was thus for&s;ak|en; and no harm done, which was much apprehended: But the fear the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> were in was &s;uch, that they dur&s;t not venture on any thing, which mu&s;t have drawn &s;evere revenges after it. So the Prote&s;tants there, being now the Ma&s;ters, they declared for the King. <HI>Drogheda</HI> did al&s;o Capitulate.</P>
<P>But, to balance this great &s;ucce&s;s, the King had, the very day after the Battle at the <HI>Boyne,</HI> the news of a Battle fought in <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Battle of <HI>Flerus.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Flanders,</HI> between Prince <HI>Waldeck</HI> and the Mar&s;hal <HI>Luxem|bourg,</HI> in which the former was defeated. The Cavalry did at the fir&s;t charge run, but the Foot made an amazing &s;tand. The <HI>French</HI> had the honour of a Victory, and took many Pri|&s;oners, with the Artillery: Yet the &s;tand the Infantry made was &s;uch, that they lo&s;t more than they got by the day: Nor were they able to draw any advantage from it. This was the Battle of <HI>Flerus,</HI> that, in the Con&s;equence of it, proved the means of pre|&s;erving <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>On the day before the Battle of the <HI>Boyne,</HI> the two Fleets <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Engage|ment at Sea,</NOTE> came to a great Engagement at Sea. The Squadron, that lay at <HI>Plymouth,</HI> could not come up to join the great Fleet, the Wind being contrary; So it was under debate, what was fitte&s;t to be done: The Earl of <HI>Torrington</HI> thought he was not &s;trong e|nough, and advi&s;ed his coming in, till &s;ome more Ships, that were fitting out, &s;hould be ready: Some began to call his cou|rage in que&s;tion, and imputed this to fear; They thought, this would too much exalt our Enemies, and di&s;courage our Al|lies, if we left the <HI>French</HI> to triumph at Sea, and to be the ma&s;|ters of our Coa&s;t and Trade; For our Merchants riche&s;t Ships were coming home; So that the leaving them, in &s;uch a &s;uperi|ority, would be both very unbecoming, and very mi&s;chievous to us. The Queen ordered <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> to advi&s;e, both with the Navy Board, and with all that under&s;tood Sea affairs; And, upon a view of the &s;trength of both Fleets, they were of opinion, that tho' the <HI>French</HI> were &s;uperior in Number, yet our Fleet was &s;o equal in &s;trength to them, that it was rea&s;onable to &s;end orders
<PB N="53" REF="74">
to our Admiral, to venture on an Engagement: Yet the Orders were not &s;o po&s;itive, but that a great deal was left to a Council of War. The two Fleets engaged near <HI>Beachy</HI> in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex;</HI> The <HI>Dutch</HI> led the Van; and, to &s;hew their courage, they advanced too far out of the Line, and fought, in the beginning, with &s;ome advantage, the <HI>French</HI> plying before them; And our Blue Squa|dron engaged bravely: But the Earl of <HI>Torrington</HI> kept in his Line, and continued to fight at a di&s;tance: The <HI>French,</HI> &s;eeing the <HI>Dutch</HI> came out &s;o far before the Line, fell on them furiou&s;ly, both in front and flank, which the Earl of <HI>Torrington</HI> neglected for &s;ome time; And, when he endeavoured to come a little nearer, the calm was &s;uch, that he could not come up. The <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;uffered much; and their whole Fleet had peri&s;hed, if their Admiral, <HI>Calembourg,</HI> had not ordered them to drop their Anchors, while their Sails were all up; This was not ob&s;erved by the <HI>French:</HI> So they were carried by the Tide, while the others lay &s;till; And thus in a few minutes the <HI>Dutch</HI> were out of danger. They lo&s;t many men, and &s;unk &s;ome of their Ships, which had &s;uffered the mo&s;t, that they might not fall into the Enemies hands. It was now nece&s;&s;ary to order the Fleet to come in, with all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te; Both the <HI>Dutch</HI> and the Blue Squa|dron complained much of the Earl of <HI>Torrington;</HI> And it was a general opinion, that if the whole Fleet had come up to a clo&s;e Fight, we mu&s;t have beat the <HI>French:</HI> And, con&s;idering how far they were from <HI>Bre&s;t,</HI> and that our Squadron at <HI>Ply|mouth</HI> lay between them and home, a Victory might have had great con&s;equences. Our Fleet was now in a bad condition, and broken into factions; And if the <HI>French</HI> had not lo&s;t the night's Tide, but had followed us clo&s;e, they might have de&s;troyed ma|ny of our Ships: Both the Admirals were almo&s;t equally blam|ed; Ours for not fighting, and the <HI>French</HI> for not pur&s;uing his Victory.</P>
<P>Our Fleet came in &s;afe; And all po&s;&s;ible diligence was u&s;ed <NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>French</HI> ma&s;ters of the Sea.</NOTE> in refitting it: The Earl of <HI>Torrington</HI> was &s;ent to the Tower, and Three of our be&s;t Sea Officers had the joint command of the Fleet; But it was a Month before they could &s;et out; And, in all that time, the <HI>French</HI> were ma&s;ters of the Sea, and our Coa&s;ts were open to them. If they had followed the fir&s;t con&s;terna|tion, and had fallen to the burning our Sea Towns, they might have done us much mi&s;chief, and put our affairs in great di&s;or|der; for we had not above &s;even thou&s;and men then in <HI>Eng|land.</HI> The Militia was rai&s;ed, and &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons were put in pri&s;on: In this melancholy conjuncture, tho' the Harve&s;t drew on, &s;o that it was not convenient for people, to be long ab&s;ent
<PB N="54" REF="75">
from their labour, yet the Nation expre&s;&s;ed more zeal and af|fection to the Government, than was expected; And the Jaco|bites, all <HI>England</HI> over, kept out of the way, and were afraid of being fallen upon by the Rabble. We had no great lo&s;&s;es at Sea: for mo&s;t of our Merchant-men came &s;afe into <HI>Plymouth:</HI> The <HI>French</HI> &s;tood over, for &s;ome time, to their own Coa&s;t; And we had many fal&s;e alarms of their &s;hipping Troops, in order to a De&s;cent. But they had &s;uffered &s;o much, in the Battle at <HI>Flerus,</HI> and the <HI>Dutch</HI> u&s;ed &s;uch diligence, in putting their Army in a condition to take the Field again, and the Elector of <HI>Branden|burgh,</HI> bringing his Troops to act in conjunction with theirs, gave the <HI>French</HI> &s;o much work, that they were forced, for all their Victory, to lie upon the defen&s;ive, and were not able to &s;pare &s;o many men, as were nece&s;&s;ary for an Inva&s;ion. The <HI>Dutch</HI> did indeed &s;end po&s;itive orders to Prince <HI>Waldeck,</HI> not to hazard another Engagement, till the Fleet &s;hould be again at Sea: This re&s;trained the Elector, who, in conjunction with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> was much &s;uperior to <HI>Luxembourg:</HI> And afterwards, when the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;uper&s;eded tho&s;e Orders, the Elector did not think fit to hazard his Army. Such is the fate of Confederate Armies, when they are under a different direction; that when the one is willing, or at lea&s;t &s;eems to be &s;o, the other &s;tands off. The <HI>French</HI> riding &s;o long, &s;o quietly in our Seas, was far from what might have been expected, after &s;uch an advantage: We under&s;tood af|terwards, that they were &s;till waiting, when the Jacobites &s;hould, according to their promi&s;es, have begun a Ri&s;ing in <HI>England;</HI> But they excu&s;ed their failing in that, becau&s;e their Leaders were generally clapp'd up.</P>
<P>That Party began to boa&s;t, all <HI>England</HI> over, that it was vi|&s;ible the <HI>French</HI> meant no harm to the Nation; but only to bring back King <HI>James;</HI> &s;ince now, tho' our Coa&s;ts lay open to them, they did us no harm. And this might have made &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion, if the <HI>French</HI> had not effectually refuted it. Their Fleet lay for &s;ome days in <HI>Torbay;</HI> Their Equipages were weakned; And by a ve&s;&s;el, that carried a Pacquet from <HI>Tour|ville,</HI> to the Court of <HI>France,</HI> which was taken, it appeared, that they were then in &s;o bad a condition, that if our Fleet (which upon this was ha&s;tened out all that was po&s;&s;ible) could have over|taken them, we &s;hould have got a great Victory very cheap. But before they &s;ailed, they made a De&s;cent on a mi&s;erable Vil|lage, called <HI>Tinmouth,</HI> that happen'd to belong to a Papi&s;t; They burnt it, and a few Fi&s;her-Boats that belonged to it; But the Inhabitants got away; and, as a Body of Militia was march|ing thither, the <HI>French</HI> made great ha&s;te back to their Ships:
<PB N="55" REF="76">
The <HI>French</HI> publi&s;hed this in their Gazettes, with much pomp, as if it had been a great Trading Town, that had many Ships, with &s;ome Men of War in Port: This both render'd them ridi|culous, and &s;erved to rai&s;e the hatred of the Nation again&s;t them; for every Town, on the Coa&s;t, &s;aw what they mu&s;t expect, if the <HI>French</HI> &s;hould prevail.</P>
<P>In all this time of fear and di&s;order, the Queen &s;hewed an <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen's behaviour upon this occa&s;ion.</NOTE> extraordinary firmne&s;s; For tho' &s;he was full of di&s;mal thoughts, yet &s;he put on her ordinary cheerfulne&s;s, when &s;he appeared in publick, and &s;hewed no indecent concern: I &s;aw her all that while once a week; For I &s;taid that Summer at <HI>Wind&s;or;</HI> Her behaviour was, in all re&s;pects, heroical: She apprehended the greatne&s;s of our danger; But &s;he committed her&s;elf to God; And was re&s;olved to expo&s;e her&s;elf, if occa&s;ion &s;hould require it; For &s;he told me, &s;he would give me leave to wait on her, if &s;he was forced to make a Campaign in <HI>England,</HI> while the King was in <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>Whil&s;t the misfortunes in <HI>Flanders,</HI> and at Sea, were putting <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King came to <HI>Dublin.</HI></NOTE> us in no &s;mall agitation, the news fir&s;t of the King's pre&s;ervation from the Cannon ball, and then of the Victory, gained the day after, put another face on our Affairs: The Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI> told me, that when he carried the news to the Queen, and ac|quainted her in a few words, that the King was well; that he had gained an entire Victory; and that the late King had e|&s;caped; he ob&s;erved her Looks, and found that the la&s;t Article made her joy compleat, which &s;eemed in &s;ome &s;u&s;pence, till &s;he under&s;tood that. The Queen and Council, upon this, &s;ent to the King, pre&s;&s;ing him to come over with all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te; &s;ince, as <HI>England</HI> was of more importance, &s;o the &s;tate of Affairs re|quired his Pre&s;ence here: For it was hoped, the Reduction of <HI>Ireland</HI> would be now ea&s;ily brought about. The King, as he received the news of the Battle of <HI>Flerus,</HI> the day after the Vic|tory at the <HI>Boyne,</HI> &s;o on the day, in which he entred <HI>Dublin,</HI> he had the news of the misfortune at Sea, to temper the joy, that his own Succe&s;&s;es might give him; He had taken all the Earl of <HI>Tyrconnel</HI>'s papers in the Camp; And he found all King <HI>James</HI>'s papers, left behind him in <HI>Dublin:</HI> By the&s;e he under|&s;tood the de&s;ign, the <HI>French</HI> had of burning his Tran&s;port Fleet, which was therefore fir&s;t to be taken care of; And &s;ince the <HI>French</HI> were now Ma&s;ters at Sea, he &s;aw nothing that could hinder the execution of that De&s;ign.</P>
<P>Among the Earl of <HI>Tyrconnel</HI>'s papers, there was one Letter <NOTE PLACE="marg">A $span$ the King</NOTE> writ to Queen <HI>Mary</HI> at <HI>St. Germains,</HI> the night before the Bat|tle; But it was not &s;ent. In it, he &s;aid, he looked on all as lo&s;t;
<PB N="56" REF="77">
And ended it thus; <HI>I have now no hope in any thing but in</HI> Jones'<HI>s bu&s;ine&s;s.</HI> The Marqui&s;s of <HI>Caermartben</HI> told me, that &s;ome weeks before the King went to <HI>Ireland,</HI> he had received an adverti&s;ement, that one named <HI>Jones,</HI> an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> man, who had &s;erved &s;o long in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> that he &s;poke both Languages well, was to be &s;ent over to murder the King. And Sir <HI>Robert Southwell</HI> told me, that he, as Secretary of State for <HI>Ireland,</HI> had looked into all <HI>Tyrconnel</HI>'s papers, and the copies of the Letters he wrote to Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> which he had &s;till in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: And he gave me the Copies of two of them. In one of the&s;e he writes, that <HI>Jones</HI> was come; that his propo|&s;ition was more probable, and liker to &s;ucceed, than any yet made; His demands were high; but he added, <HI>if any thing can be high for &s;uch a &s;ervice.</HI> In another he writes, that <HI>Jones</HI> had been with the King, who did not like the thing at fir&s;t; But he added, we have now &s;o &s;atisfied him both in Con&s;cience and Honour, that every thing is done that <HI>Jones</HI> de&s;ires. <HI>Southwell</HI> further told me, that <HI>Deagle,</HI> the Attorney-General, had furni&s;hed him with money, and a Poignard of a particular compo&s;ition; and that they &s;ought long for a Bible, bound without a Common Prayer Book, which he was to carry in his pocket, that &s;o he might pa&s;s, if &s;eized on, for a Di&s;&s;en|ter. Some per&s;ons of great quality waited on him to the Boat, that was to carry him over: He was for &s;ome time delayed in <HI>Dublin;</HI> and the King had pa&s;&s;ed over to <HI>Ireland,</HI> before he could reach him; We could never hear of him more; So it is likely he went away with his money. A paper was drawn of all this matter, and de&s;igned to be publi&s;hed; But, upon &s;econd thoughts, the King and Queen had that tenderne&s;s for King <HI>James,</HI> that they &s;topp'd the publi&s;hing to the world &s;o &s;hame|ful a practice. The King &s;aid, upon this, to my &s;elf, that God had pre&s;erved him out of many dangers, and he tru&s;ted he would &s;till pre&s;erve him; He was &s;ure he was not capable of retaliating in that way. The e&s;cape of a Cannon Ball, that touched him, was &s;o &s;ignal, that it &s;wallowed up le&s;&s;er ones: Yet, in the Battle at the <HI>Boyne,</HI> a Musket Ball &s;truck the Heel of his Boot, and recoiling, killed a Hor&s;e near him; And one of his own men, mi&s;taking him for an Enemy, came up to &s;hoot him: but he gently put by his pi&s;tol, and only &s;aid, <HI>Do not you know your friends?</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Dublin</HI> he publi&s;hed a Proclamation of Grace, offering, to all the inferior &s;ort of the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> their Lives and per&s;onal E&s;tates, re&s;erving the con&s;ideration of the real E&s;tates of the bet|ter &s;ort to a Parliament, and indemnifying them only for their
<PB N="57" REF="78">
Lives: It was hoped, that the fulne&s;s of the pardon of the Com|mons might have &s;eparated them from the Gentry; and that, by this means, they would be &s;o for&s;aken, that they would accept of &s;uch terms, as &s;hould be offered them. The King had intended to have made the Pardon more comprehen&s;ive; hoping, by that, to bring the War &s;oon to an end: But the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in <HI>Ireland</HI> oppo&s;ed this. They thought the pre&s;ent opportunity was not to be let go, of breaking the great <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Families, upon whom the inferior &s;ort would always depend. And, in compliance with them, the Indemnity, now offered, was &s;o limited, that it had no effect: For the Prie&s;ts, who governed the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> with a very blind and ab&s;olute authority, prevailed with them to try their fortunes &s;till. The news of the Victory, the <HI>French</HI> had at Sea, was &s;o magnified among them, that they made the people believe, that they would make &s;uch a De&s;cent upon <HI>England,</HI> as mu&s;t oblige the King to abandon <HI>Ireland.</HI> The King was pre&s;&s;ed to pur&s;ue the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> who had retired to <HI>Athlone</HI> and <HI>Limerick,</HI> and were now joined by their Officers, and &s;o brought again into &s;ome or|der: But the main concern was, to put the Tran&s;port Fleet in a &s;afe &s;tation. And that could not be had, till the King was ma&s;ter of <HI>Waterford,</HI> and <HI>Duncannon</HI> Fort, which commanded the en|trance into the River: Both the&s;e places capitulated; and the Tran&s;ports were brought thither. But they were not now &s;o much in danger, as the King had rea&s;on to apprehend; for King <HI>James,</HI> when he &s;ailed away from <HI>Duncannon,</HI> was forced, by contrary winds, to go into the Road of <HI>Kin&s;ale,</HI> where he found &s;ome <HI>French</HI> Frigats, that were already come to burn our Fleet: He told them, it was now too late, all was lo&s;t in <HI>Ireland.</HI> So he carried them back, to convoy him over to <HI>France;</HI> where he had but a cold reception: For the mi&s;carriage of affairs in <HI>Ireland,</HI> was imputed both to his ill conduct, and his want of courage. He fell under much contempt of the people of <HI>France:</HI> Only that King conti|nued &s;till to behave him&s;elf decently towards him.</P>
<P>The King &s;ent his Army towards the <HI>Shannon;</HI> and he him|&s;elf came to <HI>Dublin,</HI> intending, as he was advi&s;ed, to go over to <HI>England;</HI> But he found there Letters of another &s;train; Things were in &s;o good a po&s;ture, and &s;o quiet in <HI>England,</HI> that they were no more in any apprehen&s;ion of a De&s;cent: So the King went back to his Army, and marched towards <HI>Limerick.</HI> Upon this <HI>Lau&s;un,</HI> who commanded the <HI>French,</HI> left the Town; and &s;ent his equipage to <HI>France,</HI> which peri&s;hed in the <HI>Shannon.</HI> It was hoped, that <HI>Limerick,</HI> &s;eeing it &s;elf thus abandoned, would have followed the example of other Towns, and have capitulated. Upon that confidence, the King marched towards it, tho' his Ar|my
<PB N="58" REF="79">
was now much dimini&s;hed; He had left many Garri&s;ons in &s;everal places, and had &s;ent &s;ome of his be&s;t Bodies over to <HI>England;</HI> So that he had not now above 20000 men together. <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Siege of <HI>Limerick.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Limerick</HI> lies on both &s;ides of the <HI>Shannon,</HI> and on an I&s;land, that the River makes there: The <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> were yet in great numbers in <HI>Connaught;</HI> &s;o that, unle&s;s they had been &s;hut up on that &s;ide, it was ea&s;ie to &s;end in a con&s;tant &s;upply both of men and provi|&s;ions: Nor did it &s;eem advi&s;eable to undertake the Siege of a place &s;o &s;ituated, with &s;o &s;mall an Army, e&s;pecially in that &s;ea&s;on, in which it u&s;ed to rain long; and by that means, both the <HI>Shan|non</HI> would &s;well, and the ground, which was the be&s;t &s;oil of <HI>Ire|land,</HI> would be apt to become deep, and &s;carce practicable for carriages. Yet the cowardice of the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> the con&s;ternation they were in, and their being abandoned by the <HI>French,</HI> made the King re&s;olve to &s;it down before it. Their Out-works might have been defended for &s;ome time; But they abandoned the&s;e in &s;o much di&s;order, that it was from hence believed, they would not hold out long. They al&s;o abandoned the Po&s;ts, which they had on the other &s;ide of the <HI>Shannon:</HI> Upon which, the King pa&s;t the River, which was then very low, and viewed tho&s;e Po&s;ts; but he had not men to maintain them: So he continued to pre&s;s the Town on the <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> &s;ide.</P>
<P>He &s;ent for &s;ome more Ammunition, and &s;ome great Guns; They had only a guard of two Troops of Hor&s;e, to convoy them, who de&s;pi&s;ed the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> &s;o much, and thought they were at &s;uch di&s;|tance, that they &s;et their Hor&s;es to gra&s;s, and went to bed. <HI>Sar&s;|field,</HI> one of the be&s;t Officers of the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> heard that the King rode about very carele&s;ly, and upon that, had got a &s;mall Body of re&s;olute men together, on de&s;ign to &s;eize his per&s;on; But now, hearing of this Convoy, he re&s;olved to cut it off: The King had adverti&s;ement of this brought him in time, and ordered &s;ome more Troops to be &s;ent, to &s;ecure the Convoy: They, either through Treachery or Carele&s;ne&s;s, did not march till it was night, tho' their Orders were for the morning; But they came a few hours too late. <HI>Sarsfield</HI> &s;urpri&s;ed the Party, de&s;troyed the Am|munition, broke the Carriages, and bur&s;t one of the Guns, and &s;o marched off: <HI>Lanier,</HI> whom the King had &s;ent with the Party, might have overtaken him; but the general ob&s;ervation made of him (and of mo&s;t of tho&s;e Officers, who had &s;erved King <HI>James,</HI> and were now on the King's &s;ide) was, that they had a greater mind to make them&s;elves rich, by the continuance of the War of <HI>Ireland,</HI> than their Ma&s;ter great and &s;afe by the &s;peedy conclu&s;ion of it.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="80">
By this, the King lo&s;t a Week, and his Ammunition was low; for a great &s;upply, that was put on Ship Board in the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> before the King left <HI>London,</HI> &s;till remained there, the <HI>French</HI> being Ma&s;ters of the Channel. Yet the King pre&s;&s;ed the Town &s;o hard, that the Trenches were run up to the Counter|&s;carp; And when they came to lodge there, the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> ran back &s;o fa&s;t, at a Breach that the Cannon had made, that a body of the King's men run in after them; And if they had been &s;econ|ded, the Town had been immediately taken; But none came in time, &s;o they retired: And tho' the King &s;ent another body, yet they were beaten back with lo&s;s. As it now began to rain, the King &s;aw that, if he &s;taid longer there, he mu&s;t leave his great Artillery behind him: He went into the Trenches every day; And it was thought he expo&s;ed him&s;elf too much. His Tent was pitched within the reach of their Cannon; They &s;hot often over it, and beat down a Tent very near it; So he was pre|vailed on, to let it be removed to a greater di&s;tance: Once, upon receiving a Packet from <HI>England,</HI> he &s;at down in the open Field for &s;ome hours, reading his Letters, while the Cannon Balls were flying round about him. The <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> fired well; and &s;hewed, they had &s;ome courage, when they were behind Walls, how little &s;oever they had &s;hewn in the Field.</P>
<P>The King lay three Weeks before <HI>Limerick;</HI> But at la&s;t the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Siege rai&s;ed.</NOTE> rains forced him to rai&s;e the Siege: They within did not offer to &s;ally out, and di&s;order the Retreat; This la&s;t action proving unlucky, had much damped the joy, that was rai&s;ed by the fir&s;t &s;ucce&s;s of this Campaign. The King expre&s;&s;ed a great equality of temper, upon the various accidents that happened at this time. Dr. <HI>Hutton,</HI> his fir&s;t Phy&s;ician, who took care to be always near him, told me, He had ob&s;erved his Behaviour very narrowly, upon two very different occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>The one was, after the return from the Victory at the <HI>Boyne;</HI> when it was almo&s;t midnight, after he had been &s;eventeen hours in con&s;tant fatigue, with all the &s;tiffne&s;s that his Wound gave him: He expre&s;&s;ed neither joy, nor any &s;ort of Vanity; Only he looked chearful; And when tho&s;e about him made &s;uch Complements, as will be always made to Princes, even tho' they do not de&s;erve them, he put all that by, with &s;uch an unaffected neglect, that it appeared how much &s;oever he might de&s;erve the acknowledgments, that were made him, yet he did not like them. And this was &s;o vi&s;ible to all about him, that they &s;oon &s;aw, that the way to make their Court was, neither to talk of his Wound, nor of his Behaviour on that day. As &s;oon as he &s;aw his Phy&s;ician, he ordered him to &s;ee that care &s;hould be
<PB N="60" REF="81">
taken of the wounded men, and he named the Pri&s;oners, as well as his own Soldiers. And tho' he had great rea&s;on to be offended with <HI>Hamilton,</HI> who had been employed to treat with the Earl of <HI>Tyrconnell,</HI> and was taken pri&s;oner in his &s;ight, and was pre&s;erved by his order: yet &s;ince he &s;aw he was wounded, he gave particular directions to look after him. Upon the whole matter, the King was as grave and &s;ilent as he u&s;ed to be; and the joy of a day, that had been both &s;o happy and &s;o glorious to him, did not &s;eem to alter his temper or deportment in any way.</P>
<P>He told me, he was al&s;o near him, when it was re&s;olved to rai&s;e the Siege of <HI>Limerick;</HI> and &s;aw the &s;ame calm, without the lea&s;t depre&s;&s;ion, di&s;order, or peevi&s;hne&s;s: From this he <NOTE PLACE="marg">The equa|lity of the King's tem|per.</NOTE> concluded, that either his mind was &s;o happily balanced, that no accident could put it out of that &s;ituation; or that, if he had commotions within, he had a very extraordinary command over his temper, in re&s;training or concealing them.</P>
<P>While he lay before <HI>Limerick,</HI> he had news from <HI>England,</HI> that our Fleet was now out, and that the <HI>French</HI> were gone to <HI>Bre&s;t:</HI> So, &s;ince we were Ma&s;ters of the Sea, the Earl of <HI>Marl|borough</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earl of <HI>Marlbo|rough</HI> pro|po&s;es the taking <HI>Cork</HI> and <HI>Kin&s;ale</HI> in Winter, and effects it.</NOTE> propo&s;ed, that five thou&s;and men, who had lain idle all this Summer in <HI>England,</HI> &s;hould be &s;ent to <HI>Ireland;</HI> and with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;uch men as the King &s;hould order to join them, they &s;hould try to take <HI>Cork</HI> and <HI>Kin&s;ale.</HI> The King ap|proved of this; And ordered the Earl to come over with them: And he left orders for about five thou&s;and more, who were to join him. And &s;o he broke up this Campaign, and came over to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and from thence to <HI>London.</HI> The contrary winds &s;topp'd the Earl of <HI>Marlborough</HI> &s;o, that it was <HI>October</HI> before he got to <HI>Ireland.</HI> He &s;oon took <HI>Cork</HI> by &s;torm: And four thou&s;and men, that lay there in Garri&s;on, were made pri&s;oners of War. In this action, the Duke of <HI>Grafton</HI> received a &s;hot, of which he died in a few days; He was the more lamented, as being the per&s;on of all King <HI>Charles</HI>'s Children, of whom there was the greate&s;t hope: He was brave, and probably would have become a great man at Sea. From <HI>Cork,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Marlborough</HI> marched to <HI>Kin&s;ale,</HI> where he found the two Forts, that com|manded the Port, to be &s;o much &s;tronger, than the Plans had re|pre&s;ented them to be, that he told me, if he had known their true &s;trength, he had never undertaken the expedition, in a &s;ea|&s;on &s;o far advanced; yet in a few days the place capitulated. The <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> drew their forces together, but dur&s;t not venture on rai&s;ing the Siege; But to divert it, they &s;et the Country about, which was the be&s;t built of any in <HI>Ireland,</HI> all in a flame.</P>

<P>Lord <HI>Melvill</HI> carried down Powers, fir&s;t to offer to Duke <HI>Ha|milton,</HI> if he would join in common mea&s;ures heartily with him, to be Commi&s;&s;ioner in Parliament, or if he proved intractable, as indeed he did, to &s;erve in that Po&s;t him&s;elf. He had full In|&s;tructions for the Settlement of Presbytery; For he a&s;&s;ured the King, that without that, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to carry any thing; Only the King would not con&s;ent to the taking away the Rights of Patronage, and the Supremacy of the Crown: Yet he found the&s;e &s;o much in&s;i&s;ted on, that he &s;ent one to the King to <HI>Ireland,</HI> for fuller in&s;tructions in tho&s;e Points; They were enlarged, but in &s;uch general words, that the King did not un|der&s;tand, that his In&s;tructions could warrant what Lord <HI>Melvill</HI> did; for he gave them both up. And the King was &s;o offended with him for it, that he lo&s;t all the credit he had with him; tho' the King did not think fit to di&s;own him, or to call him to an account, for going beyond his In&s;tructions.</P>
<P>The Jacobites per&s;waded all their Party to go to the Parlia|ment, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parlia|ment there.</NOTE> and to take the Oaths; for many of the Nobility &s;tood off, and would not own the King, nor &s;wear to him: Great Pains were taken by <HI>Pater&s;on,</HI> one of their Archbi&s;hops, to per|&s;wade them to take the Oaths, but on de&s;ign to break them; For he thought, by that means, they could have a majority in Parliament; tho' &s;ome of the Laity were too hone&s;t to agree to &s;uch Advices; but with all the&s;e wicked arts, they were not able to carry a majority. So other things failing, they &s;aw a nece&s;&s;ity of de&s;iring a Force to be &s;ent over from <HI>France:</HI> This appeared &s;o odious, and &s;o de&s;tructive of their Country, that &s;ome of them refu&s;ed to concur in it: Others were not plea&s;ed with the an&s;wers King <HI>James</HI> had &s;ent to the Propo&s;itions, they had made him. He had indeed granted all that they had asked, upon their own particular Intere&s;ts, and had promi&s;ed to &s;ettle Presbytery; but he rejected all tho&s;e demands, that imported a diminution of his Prerogative, in as firm a manner, as if he had been already &s;et on the Throne again: They propo&s;ed, finding his an&s;wer &s;o little to their &s;atisfaction, to &s;end him a &s;econd me&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>Upon this, the Earls of <HI>Argyle, Annandale,</HI> and <HI>Braidalbin,</HI> withdrew from them: <HI>Annandale</HI> came up to the <HI>Bath,</HI> pre|tending <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Plot di&s;|covered.</NOTE> his ill health: Both Lord <HI>Argyle</HI> and <HI>Braidalbin</HI> went to <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> pretending, as they &s;aid afterwards, that they intended to di&s;cover the whole matter to the King; But he had pa&s;&s;ed over to <HI>Ireland,</HI> before they got to <HI>Che&s;ter. Montgomery</HI> upon
<PB N="63" REF="84">
this, looked on the de&s;ign as broken; And &s;o he went, and reconciled him&s;elf to <HI>Melvill,</HI> and di&s;covered the whole Nego|tiation to him. Upon which, the Earl of <HI>Melvill</HI> pre&s;&s;ed the King to grant a general Indemnity, and gave <HI>Montgomery</HI> a Pa&s;s to go to <HI>London;</HI> And he wrote to the Queen in his Favour. But the King was re&s;olved to know the bottom of the Plot, and particularly how far any of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were engaged in it; So <HI>Montgomery</HI> ab&s;conded for &s;ome time in <HI>London,</HI> &s;ince he &s;aw no hopes of pardon, but upon a full di&s;covery. A Warrant was &s;ent to the <HI>Bath</HI> for the Earl of <HI>Annandale,</HI> of which he had notice given him, and went up privately to <HI>London. Mont|gomery</HI> &s;ent <HI>Fergu&s;on</HI> to him, a&s;&s;uring him, that he had di&s;co|vered nothing, and de&s;iring him to continue firm and &s;ecret; But when he had certain notice, that <HI>Montgomery</HI> had di&s;covered all the Negotiation among the <HI>Scotch,</HI> he ca&s;t him&s;elf on the Queen's mercy, asking no other conditions, but that he might not be made an evidence again&s;t others. He him&s;elf had not treated with any in <HI>England,</HI> &s;o, as to them, he was only a &s;econd-hand Witne&s;s; Only he informed again&s;t <HI>Nevil Payne,</HI> who had been &s;ent down to <HI>Scotland,</HI> to manage matters a|mong them: He was taken there, but would confe&s;s nothing; Upon the Earl of <HI>Annandale</HI>'s information, which he gave upon Oath, the Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI> wrote to the Council of <HI>Scotland,</HI> that he had in his hands a Depo&s;ition upon Oath, containing Matter of High Trea&s;on again&s;t <HI>Payne;</HI> Upon which it was pretended, that, according to the Law of <HI>Scotland,</HI> he might be put to the torture; and that was executed with rigour: He re&s;i&s;ted a double que&s;tion, yet was &s;till kept a pri&s;oner; And this was much cried out on, as barbarous and illegal. <HI>Mont|gomery</HI> lay hid for &s;ome months at <HI>London;</HI> But when he &s;aw he could not have his pardon, but by making a full di&s;covery, he cho&s;e rather to go beyond Sea: So fatally did Ambition and Di&s;content hurry a Man to ruin, who &s;eemed capable of greater things. His art in managing &s;uch a de&s;ign, and his firmne&s;s in not di&s;covering his Accomplices, rai&s;ed his character, as much as it ruined his fortune. He continued in perpetual Plots after this, to no purpo&s;e: He was once taken, but made his e&s;cape; And at la&s;t, &s;pleen and vexation put an end to a turbulent life.</P>
<P>The Lord <HI>Melvill</HI> had now a clear majority in Parliament, by the di&s;covery of the Plot; &s;ome ab&s;ented them&s;elves; and others, to redeem them&s;elves, were compliant in all things: The main point, by which <HI>Melvill</HI> de&s;igned to fix him&s;elf, and his party, was, the aboli&s;hing of Epi&s;copacy, and the &s;etting up of
<PB N="64" REF="85">
Presbytery. The one was &s;oon done, by repealing all the laws in favour of Epi&s;copacy, and declaring it contrary to the genius and con&s;titution of that Church and Nation; For the King would not con&s;ent to a plain and &s;imple condemnation of it. But it was not &s;o ea&s;y to &s;ettle Presbytery: If they had followed the pattern, &s;et them in the Year 1638, all the Clergy, in a parity, were to a&s;&s;ume the government of the Church; but tho&s;e being Epi&s;copal, they did not think it &s;afe to put the power of the Church in &s;uch hands; Therefore it was pretended, that &s;uch of the Presbyterian Mini&s;ters, as had been turned out in the Year 1662, ought to be con&s;idered, as the only &s;ound part of the Church; And of the&s;e there happened to be then three|&s;core alive: &s;o the government of the Church was lodged with them; And they were empowered, to take to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and to a &s;hare in the Church government, &s;uch as they &s;hould think fit: Some furious men, who had gone into very frantick Prin|ciples, and all tho&s;e who had been &s;ecretly ordained in the Presbyterian way, were pre&s;ently taken in: This was like to prove a fatal error, at their fir&s;t &s;etting out; The old men a|mong them, what by rea&s;on of their age, or their experience of former mi&s;takes, were di&s;po&s;ed to more moderate Coun&s;els; But the taking in &s;uch a number of violent men, put it out of their power to pur&s;ue them; So the&s;e broke out into a mo&s;t extravagant way of proceeding again&s;t &s;uch of the Epi&s;copal party, as had e&s;caped the rage of the former Year. Accu&s;ations were rai&s;ed again&s;t them; &s;ome were charged for their doctrine, as guilty of <HI>Arminiani&s;m;</HI> Others were loaded with more &s;can|dalous Imputations: But the&s;e were only thrown out to defame them. And where they looked for proof, it was in a way more becoming Inqui&s;itors, than Judges: &s;o apt are all parties, in their turns of power, to fall into tho&s;e very exce&s;&s;es, of which they did formerly make &s;uch tragical complaints. All other matters were carried in the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as the Lord <HI>Melvill,</HI> and the Presbyterians de&s;ired. In lieu of the King's Supremacy, he had Chimney-money given him; and a Te&s;t was impo&s;ed on all in office, or capable of electing, or being elected to &s;erve in Parliament, declaring the King and Queen to be their rightful and lawful Sovereigns, and renouncing any man|ner of Title pretended to be in King <HI>James.</HI></P>
<P>As for affairs abroad, the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> came into the Al|liance: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs a|$span$.</NOTE> The <HI>French</HI> &s;u&s;pected he was in a &s;ecret Treaty with the Emperor, and &s;o they forced him to declare it, before mat|ters were ripe for it. They demanded, that he would put <HI>Turin</HI> and <HI>Montmelian</HI> in their hands. This was upon the matter to
<PB N="65" REF="86">
ask all, and to make him a va&s;&s;al Prince: Upon his refu&s;al, a <HI>French</HI> Army took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Savoy;</HI> and marched into <HI>Piedmont,</HI> before he was ready to receive them: For tho' the Imperiali&s;ts and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had made him great promi&s;es, in which they are never wanting, when their affairs require it; yet they failed &s;o totally in the performance, that if the King and the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who had promi&s;ed him nothing, had not performed every thing effectually, he mu&s;t have become at once a prey to the <HI>French.</HI> The Emperor was this Year unhappy in <HI>Hungary,</HI> both by lo&s;ing <HI>Belgrade,</HI> and by &s;ome other ad|vantages, which the <HI>Turks</HI> gained: Yet he was as little inclined to Peace, as he was capable of carrying on the War.</P>
<P>The King, at his fir&s;t coming over from <HI>Ireland,</HI> was &s;o little wearied with that Campaign, that he intended to have gone over to his Army in <HI>Flanders:</HI> But it was too late; for they were going into Winter quarters: So he held the Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament early, about the beginning of <HI>October,</HI> that &s;o, the Funds being &s;ettled for the next Year, he might have an inter|view with many of the <HI>German</HI> Princes, who intended to meet him at the <HI>Hague,</HI> that they might concert mea&s;ures for the next Campaign.</P>
<P>Both Hou&s;es began with Addre&s;&s;es of Thanks and Congra|tulation <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament in <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> to the King and Queen, in which they &s;et forth the &s;en&s;e they had of their pious care of their people, of their courage and good government, in the highe&s;t expre&s;&s;ions that could be conceived; with promi&s;es of &s;tanding by them, and a&s;|&s;i&s;ting them, with every thing that &s;hould be found nece&s;&s;ary for the publick Service: And they were as good as their word: for the King, having laid before them the charge of the next Year's War, the e&s;timate ri&s;ing to above four millions, the va&s;t|e&s;t &s;um that ever a King of <HI>England</HI> had asked of his peo|ple, they agreed to it; the oppo&s;ition, that was made, being very incon&s;iderable; And they con&s;ented to the Funds pro|po&s;ed, which were thought equal to that, which was demanded, tho' the&s;e proved afterwards to be defective. The Admini&s;tra|tion was &s;o ju&s;t and gentle, that there were no grievances to in|flame the Hou&s;e; by which the mo&s;t promi&s;ing beginnings of &s;ome Se&s;&s;ions, in former Reigns, had often mi&s;carried.</P>
<P>Some indeed began to complain of a mi&s;management of the Publick Money: But the Mini&s;try put a &s;top to that, by moving for a Bill, empowering &s;uch, as the Parliament &s;hould name, to examine into all Accounts, with all particulars relating to them; giving them authority to bring all per&s;ons, that they &s;hould have occa&s;ion for, before them, and to tender them an Oath,
<PB N="66" REF="87">
to di&s;cover their knowledge of &s;uch things, as they &s;hould ask of them. This was like the power of a Court of Inqui&s;ition: And how unu&s;ual &s;oever &s;uch a Commi&s;&s;ion was, yet it &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary to grant it; for the bearing down, and &s;ilencing all &s;candalous reports. When this Bill was brought to the Lords, it was moved, that &s;ince the Commons had named none, but Members of their own Hou&s;e, that the Lords &s;hould add &s;ome of their Number: This was done by ballot; And the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> having made the motion, the greate&s;t number of bal|lots were for him; But he refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to this, with &s;o much firmne&s;s, that the other Lords, who were named with him, &s;eemed to think they were in Honour bound to do the &s;ame; &s;o, &s;ince no Peer would &s;uffer him&s;elf to be named, the Bill pa&s;&s;ed as it was &s;ent up. Many complaints were made, of the illegal Commitments of &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons for High Trea&s;on; tho' there was nothing &s;worn again&s;t them. But the Danger was &s;o apparent, and the Publick &s;afety was &s;o much concerned in tho&s;e Impri&s;onments, that the Hou&s;e of Commons made a precedent, for &s;ecuring a Mini&s;try, that &s;hould do the like, upon the like nece&s;&s;ity, and yet maintained the <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> Act; They indemnified the Mini&s;try, for all that had been done contrary to that Act.</P>
<P>Great Complaints were brought over from <HI>Ireland,</HI> where <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ireland</HI> much wa&s;t|ed by the <HI>Rapparees</HI> and the Ar|my there.</NOTE> the King's Army was almo&s;t as heavy on the Country, as the <HI>Rapparees</HI> were: There was a great Arrear due to them; for which rea&s;on, when the King &s;ettled a Government in <HI>Ire|land,</HI> of three Lords Ju&s;tices, he did not put the Army under their Civil Authority, but kept them in a military &s;ubjection to their Officers: For he &s;aid, &s;ince the Army was not regu|larly paid, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to keep them from Mutiny, if they were put under &s;trict Di&s;cipline, and puni&s;hed accor|dingly. The Under Officers, finding that they were only an|&s;werable to their Superior Officers, took great Liberties in their Quarters; and, in&s;tead of protecting the Country, they op|pre&s;&s;ed it. The King had brought over an Army of &s;even thou|&s;and <HI>Danes,</HI> under the command of a very gallant Prince, one of the Dukes of <HI>Wirtemberg;</HI> But they were cruel friends, and thought they were Ma&s;ters; Nor were the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Troops much better. The <HI>Dutch</HI> were the lea&s;t complained of; <HI>Ginkle,</HI> who had the chief command, looked &s;trictly to them; But he did not think it convenient to put tho&s;e of other Nations, under the &s;ame &s;evere mea&s;ures. But the Pay, due for &s;ome months, being now &s;ent over, the Orders were changed; And the Army was made &s;ubject to the Civil Government: Yet it was under|&s;tood,
<PB N="67" REF="88">
that In&s;tructions were &s;ent to the Lord's Ju&s;tices, to be cautious in the exerci&s;e of their Authority over them; &s;o the Country &s;till &s;uffered much by the&s;e Forces.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of Commons pa&s;t a Vote, to rai&s;e a million of <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Bill con|cerning the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> For|feitures.</NOTE> money, out of the Forfeitures and Confi&s;cations in <HI>Ireland:</HI> And in order to that, they pa&s;&s;ed a Bill of Attainder of all tho&s;e, who had been engaged in the Rebellion of <HI>Ire|land,</HI> and appropriated the Confi&s;cations, to the rai&s;ing a Fund for defraying the expence of the pre&s;ent War; Only they left a power to the King, to grant away a third part of tho&s;e confi&s;cated E&s;tates, to &s;uch as had &s;erved in the War; and to give &s;uch Articles and Capitulations to tho&s;e, who were in Arms, as he &s;hould think fit. Upon this Bill, many petitions were offered, the creditors of &s;ome, and the heirs of others, who had continued faithful to the Government, de&s;ired provi&s;o's for their &s;ecurity. The Commons, &s;eeing that there was no end of Petitions, for &s;uch provi&s;o's, rejected them all; imitating in this too much the mock Parliament, that King <HI>James</HI> held in <HI>Dublin;</HI> in which about 3000 per&s;ons were attainted, with|out proof or proce&s;s, only becau&s;e &s;ome of them were gone over to <HI>England,</HI> and others were ab&s;conding, or informed a|gain&s;t in <HI>Ireland.</HI> But when this Bill was brought up to the Lords, they thought they were in ju&s;tice bound to hear all pe|titions: Upon this, the Bill was like to be clogg'd with many provi&s;o's; And the matter mu&s;t have held long: So the King, to &s;top this, &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the Commons: And he &s;poke to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, afterwards from the Throne, to both Hou&s;es: He promi&s;ed, he would give no Grants of any confi&s;cated E|&s;tates; but would keep that matter entire, to the con&s;ideration of another Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament: By which the King intended only, to a&s;&s;ure them, that he would give none of tho&s;e E&s;tates to his Courtiers or Officers; But he thought, he was &s;till at liberty, to pa&s;s &s;uch Acts of Grace, or grant &s;uch Articles to the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> as the &s;tate of his affairs &s;hould require.</P>
<P>There were no important Debates, in the Hou&s;e of Lords. <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earl of <HI>Torrington</HI> tried and ju&s;tified.</NOTE> The Earl of <HI>Torrington</HI>'s Bu&s;ine&s;s held them long: The form of his Commitment was judged to be illegal; And the Martial Law, to which, by the Statute, all who &s;erved in the Fleet were &s;ubject, being lodged in the Lord High Admiral, it was doubted, whether, the Admiralty being now in Commi&s;&s;ion, that power was lodged with the Commi&s;&s;ioners. The Judges were of o|pinion, that it was: Yet, &s;ince the power of life and death was too &s;acred a thing, to pa&s;s only by a con&s;truction of Law, it was thought the &s;afe&s;t cour&s;e, to pa&s;s an Act, declaring, that the
<PB N="68" REF="89">
powers of a Lord High Admiral did ve&s;t in the Commi&s;&s;ioners. The &s;ecret Enemies of the Government, who intended to embroil matters, moved that the Earl of <HI>Torrington</HI> &s;hould be impeached in Parliament; Proceedings in that way being always &s;low, In|cidents were al&s;o apt to fall in, that might create di&s;putes be|tween the two Hou&s;es, which did &s;ometimes end in a Rup|ture: But the King was apprehen&s;ive of that; And, tho' he was much incen&s;ed again&s;t that Lord, and had rea&s;on to be|lieve, that a Council of War would treat him very favourably; yet he cho&s;e rather to let it go &s;o, than to di&s;order his affairs. The Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Admiralty named a Court to try him, who did it with &s;o gro&s;s a partiality, that it reflected much on the Ju&s;tice of the Nation; &s;o that, if it had not been for the great Intere&s;t the King had in the States, it might have occa&s;ioned a breach of the Alliance between them and us. He came off &s;afe as to his Per&s;on and E&s;tate, but much loaded in his Reputation; &s;ome charging him with want of courage, while others imputed his ill conduct, to a haughty &s;ullenne&s;s of temper, that made him, &s;ince orders were &s;ent him, contrary to the advices he had given, to re&s;olve indeed to obey them, and fight; but in &s;uch a manner, as &s;hould ca&s;t the blame on tho&s;e, who had &s;ent him the Orders, and give them cau&s;e to repent of it.</P>
<P>Another Debate was moved in the Hou&s;e of Lords (by tho&s;e <NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;igns a|gain&s;t the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Caermar|then.</HI></NOTE> who intended to revive the old Impeachment of the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Caermarthen)</HI> whether Impeachments continued, from Parlia|ment to Parliament, or whether they were not extingui&s;hed by an Act of Grace: Some antient Precedents were brought to favour this, by tho&s;e who intended to keep them up: But in all the&s;e, there had been an order of one Parliament, to con|tinue them on to the next: So they did not come home to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e: and how doubtful &s;oever it was, whether the King's Pardon could be pleaded in Bar to an Impeachment; yet, &s;ince the King had &s;ent an Act of Grace, which had pa&s;&s;ed in the fir&s;t Se&s;&s;ion of this Parliament, it &s;eemed very unrea&s;onable, to offer an Impeachment again&s;t an Act of Parliament. All this di&s;covered a de&s;ign again&s;t that Lord, who was believed to have the greate&s;t credit, both with the King and Queen, and was again falling under an univer&s;al hatred. In a Hou&s;e of Commons, every motion again&s;t a Mini&s;ter, is apt to be well entertained; Some envy him; Others are angry at him; Many hope to &s;hare in the &s;poils of him, or of his Friends, that fall with him; And a love of change, and a wantonne&s;s of mind, makes the attacking a Mini&s;ter, a diver&s;ion to the re&s;t: The thing was well laid, and fourteen leading men had
<PB N="69" REF="90">
undertaken to manage the matter again&s;t him; In which the Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> had the chief hand, as he him&s;elf told me; For he had a very bad opinion of the man, and thought his advices would, in conclu&s;ion, ruin the King and his affairs. But a Di&s;covery was at this time made, that was of great con&s;equence; And it was managed chiefly, by his means, &s;o that put an end to the de&s;igns again&s;t him for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament was drawing to a conclu&s;ion: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord <HI>Pre&s;|ton</HI> &s;ent over to <HI>France.</HI></NOTE> And the King was making ha&s;te over, to a great Congre&s;s of many Princes, who were coming to meet him at the <HI>Hague.</HI> The Jacobites thought this opportunity was not to be lo&s;t; They fancied it would be ea&s;y, in the King's ab&s;ence, to bring a Revolution about: So they got the Lord <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI> to come up to <HI>London,</HI> and to undertake the Journey to <HI>France,</HI> and to manage this Negotiation. They thought, no time was to be lo&s;t, and that no great force was to be brought over with King <HI>James;</HI> but that a few re&s;olute men, as a guard to his per&s;on, would &s;erve the turn, now that there was &s;o &s;mall a force left within the Kingdom, and the Nation was &s;o incen&s;ed at a burthen of four millions in Taxes. By this means, if He &s;urpri&s;ed us, and managed his coming over with &s;uch &s;ecrecy, that he &s;hould bring over with him&s;elf the fir&s;t news of it, they believed this Revolution would be more ea&s;y, and more &s;udden, than the la&s;t. The men that laid this de&s;ign were, the Earl of <HI>Clarendon,</HI> the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Ely,</HI> the Lord <HI>Pre&s;ton,</HI> and his brother Mr. <HI>Graham,</HI> and <HI>Pen</HI> the famous Quaker. Lord <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI> re&s;olved to go over, and to carry Letters, from tho&s;e who had joined with him in the de&s;ign, to King <HI>James</HI> and his Queen. The Bi&s;hop of <HI>Ely</HI>'s Letters were writ in a very particular &s;tile; He under|took both for his elder Brother, and the re&s;t of the Family; which was plainly meant of <HI>Sancroft,</HI> and the other deprived Bi&s;hops: In his Letter to King <HI>James</HI>'s Queen, he a&s;&s;ured her of his, and all their zeal for the Prince of <HI>Wales;</HI> and that they would no more part with that, than with their hopes of Heaven. <HI>A&s;hton,</HI> a &s;ervant of that Queen's, hired a ve&s;&s;el to carry them over; But the owner of the ve&s;&s;el, being a man zealous for the Government, di&s;covered all he knew; which was only, that he was to carry &s;ome per&s;ons over to <HI>France:</HI> The notice of this was carried to the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Caermarthen:</HI> And the matter was &s;o ordered, that Lord <HI>Pre&s;ton, A&s;hcon,</HI> and a young man <HI>(Elliot)</HI> were got aboard, and falling down the River, when the Officer &s;ent to take them came, on pretence to &s;earch, and pre&s;s for Seamen; And drew the three Pa&s;|&s;engers out of the Hold, in which they were hid. Lord <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI>
<PB N="70" REF="91">
left his Letters behind him in the Hold, together with King <HI>James</HI>'s Signet; <HI>A&s;hton</HI> took them up, on de&s;ign to have thrown them in the Sea; But they were taken from him.</P>
<P>Both they and their Letters were brought to <HI>Whitehall.</HI> Lord <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI>'s mind &s;unk &s;o vi&s;ibly, that it was concluded, he would not die, if confe&s;&s;ing all he knew could &s;ave him. <HI>A&s;hton</HI> was more firm and &s;ullen; <HI>Elliot</HI> knew nothing. There was among their Papers one, that contained the heads of a Decla|ration, with a&s;&s;urances of Pardon, and promi&s;es to pre&s;erve the Prote&s;tant Religion, and the Laws; Another paper contained &s;hort memorials, taken by Lord <HI>Pre&s;ton,</HI> in which many of the Nobility were named: The mo&s;t important of all was, a rela|tion of a Conference, between &s;ome Noblemen and Gentlemen, Whigs and Tories; by which it appeared, that, upon a conver|&s;ation on this &s;ubject, they all &s;eemed convinced, that upon this occa&s;ion <HI>France</HI> would not &s;tudy to conquer, but to oblige <HI>England;</HI> and that King <HI>James</HI> would be wholly governed by Prote&s;tants, and follow the Prote&s;tant and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t. The Pri&s;oners were quickly brought to their Trial; Their de|&s;ign <NOTE PLACE="marg">Taken, tri|ed, and con|demned.</NOTE> of going to <HI>France,</HI> and the trea&s;onable Papers found about them, were fully proved: Some of them were writ in Lord <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI>'s, and &s;ome in <HI>A&s;hton</HI>'s hand. They made but a poor defence: They &s;aid, a &s;imilitude of hands was not thought a good proof in <HI>Sidney</HI>'s Ca&s;e; But this was now only a circum&s;tance; in what hand &s;oever the Papers were writ, the Crime was al|ways the &s;ame, &s;ince they were open, not &s;ealed: So they knew the contents of them, and thus were carrying on a Negotiation of High Trea&s;on, with the King's Enemies: Upon full evidence they were condemned.</P>
<P><HI>A&s;hton</HI> would enter into no Treaty with the Court; but pre|pared <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A&s;hton</HI> &s;uf|fered.</NOTE> him&s;elf to die. And he &s;uffered with great decency and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s. He left a Paper behind him, in which he owned his dependance on King <HI>James,</HI> and his fidelity to him; He al&s;o affirmed, that he was &s;ure the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> was born of the Queen; He denied, that he knew the contents of the Papers, that were taken with him. This made &s;ome conclude, that his paper was penned by &s;ome other per&s;on, and too ha&s;|tily copied over by him&s;elf, without making due reflections on this part of it; for I compared this paper, which he gave the Sheriff, and which was written in his own hand, with tho&s;e found about him; and it was vi&s;ible, both were writ in the &s;ame hand.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI> went backward and forward: He had no mind to die, and yet was not willing to tell all he knew; He acted
<PB N="71" REF="92">
a weak part in all re&s;pects: When he was heated by the Im|portunities of his friends, who were violently engaged again&s;t the Government, and after he had dined well, he re&s;olved he <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord <HI>$word$ $word$</HI> $word$ $word$.</NOTE> would die heroically; But by next morning, that heat went off; And when he &s;aw Death in full view, his heart failed him. The Scheme he carried over was &s;o fooli&s;h, &s;o ill concerted, and &s;o few engaged in it, that tho&s;e who knew the whole &s;e|cret concluded, that if he had got &s;afe to the Court of <HI>France,</HI> the Project would have been &s;o de&s;pi&s;ed, that he mu&s;t have been &s;u&s;pected, as &s;ent over to draw King <HI>James</HI> into a Snare, and bring him into the King's hands. The Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> was &s;eized, and put in the Tower; But the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Ely, Grimes,</HI> and <HI>Pen,</HI> ab&s;conded. After &s;ome months, the King, in regard to the Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI>'s relation to the Queen, would proceed to no extremities again&s;t him, but gave him leave to live, confined to his hou&s;e in the Country.</P>
<P>The King had &s;uffered the deprived Bi&s;hops to continue, now <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Beha|viour of the deprived Bi|&s;hops.</NOTE> above a Year, at their Sees: They all the while neglected the concerns of the Church, doing nothing, but living privately in their Palaces. I had, by the Queen's Order, moved both the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> and Sir <HI>John Trevor,</HI> who had great credit with them, to try whether, in ca&s;e an Act could be obtained, to excu&s;e them from taking the Oaths, they would go on, and do their functions in Ordinations, In&s;titutions, and Confirma|tions; and a&s;&s;i&s;t at the Publick Wor&s;hip, as formerly; But they would give no an&s;wer; Only they &s;aid, they would live quietly, that is, keep them&s;elves clo&s;e, till a proper time &s;hould encourage them to act more openly. So all the thoughts of this kind were, upon that, laid a&s;ide. One of the con&s;ider|able&s;t men of the party, Dr. <HI>Sherlock,</HI> upon King <HI>James</HI>'s going out of <HI>Ireland,</HI> thought that this gave the pre&s;ent Government a thorough &s;ettlement; And in that ca&s;e, he thought it lawful to take the Oaths; And upon that, not only took them him|&s;elf, but publickly ju&s;tified what he had done; Upon which, he was mo&s;t &s;everely libelled by tho&s;e, from whom he withdrew. The di&s;covery of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Ely</HI>'s corre&s;pondence, and en|gagement in the name of the re&s;t, gave the King a great ad|vantage in filling tho&s;e vacant Sees; which he re&s;olved to do, upon his return from the Congre&s;s, to which he went over in <HI>January.</HI></P>
<P>In his way, he ran a very great hazard; When he got within <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Cong$span$ of Prin$span$ the <HI>$word$</HI></NOTE> the <HI>Mae&s;e,</HI> &s;o that it was thought, two hours rowing would bring him to Land, being weary of the Sea, he went into an open Boat with &s;ome of his Lords: But by Mi&s;ts and Storms, he was
<PB N="72" REF="93">
to&s;&s;ed up and down above &s;ixteen hours, before he got &s;afe to Land. Yet neither he, nor any of tho&s;e who were with him, were the wor&s;e for all this cold and wet Weather. And, when the Seamen &s;eemed very apprehen&s;ive of their danger, the King &s;aid in a very intrepid manner; What are you afraid to die in my Company? He &s;oon &s;ettled &s;ome points, at which the States had &s;tuck long; And they created the Funds for that Year. The Electors of <HI>Bavaria</HI> and <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> the Dukes of <HI>Zell</HI> and <HI>Wolfenbuttel,</HI> with the Landgrave of <HI>He&s;&s;e,</HI> and a great many other <HI>German</HI> Princes, came to this Interview, and entred into con&s;ultations concerning the operations of the next Cam|paign. The Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI>'s affairs were then very low; But the King took care of him, and both furni&s;hed, as well as pro|cured him &s;uch Supplies, that his affairs had quickly a more promi&s;ing face. Things were concerted among the Princes them|&s;elves, and were kept &s;o &s;ecret, that they did not tru&s;t them to their Mini&s;ters: At lea&s;t, the King did not communicate them to the Earl of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> as he prote&s;ted &s;olemnly to me, when he came back. The Princes &s;hewed to the King all the re&s;pects that any of their rank ever paid to any crowned Head; And they lived together in &s;uch an ea&s;y freedom, that points of Ceremony occa&s;ioned no di&s;putes among them; tho' tho&s;e are often, upon le&s;s &s;olemn interviews, the &s;ubjects of much quarrelling, and in|terrupt more important Debates.</P>
<P>During this Congre&s;s, Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> the Eighth, <HI>Ottoboni,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">A new Pope cho&s;en after a long Con|clave.</NOTE> died. He had &s;ucceeded Pope <HI>Innocent,</HI> and &s;ate in that Chair almo&s;t a Year and a half: He was a <HI>Venetian,</HI> and intended to enrich his Family as much as he could. The <HI>French</HI> King re|nounced his preten&s;ions to the Franchi&s;es: And he, in return for that, promoted <HI>Fourbin,</HI> and &s;ome others, recommended by that Court, to be Cardinals; which was much re&s;ented by the Emperor. Yet he would not yield the point of the Regale to the Court of <HI>France:</HI> Nor would he grant the Bulls for tho&s;e, whom the King had named to the vacant Bi&s;hopricks in <HI>France,</HI> who had &s;igned the Formulary, pa&s;&s;ed in 1682, that declared the Pope fallible, and &s;ubject to a General Council. When Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> felt him&s;elf near Death, he pa&s;&s;ed a Bull in due Form, by which he confirmed all Pope <HI>Innocent</HI>'s Bulls: And by this he put a new &s;top, to any Reconciliation with the Court of <HI>France.</HI> This he did, to render his Name and Family more ac|ceptable to the <HI>Italians,</HI> and mo&s;t particularly to his Country|men, who hated the <HI>French</HI> as much as they feared them. Upon his Death, the Conclave continued &s;hut up for five months, be|fore they could agree upon an Election. The party of the Zea|lots
<PB N="73" REF="94">
&s;tood long firm to <HI>Barbarigo,</HI> who had the reputation of a Saint, and &s;eemed in all things to &s;et Cardinal <HI>Borromeo</HI> before him as a Pattern: They at la&s;t were per&s;waded to con&s;ent to the choice of <HI>Pignatelli,</HI> a <HI>Neapolitan,</HI> who, while he was Arch|bi&s;hop of <HI>Naples,</HI> had &s;ome di&s;putes with the Viceroy, concern|ing the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Immunities, which he a&s;&s;erted &s;o highly, that he excommunicated &s;ome of the Judges, who, as he thought, had invaded them. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> had &s;eemed di&s;plea&s;ed at this; which recommended him &s;o to the <HI>French,</HI> that they al&s;o concurred to his Elevation. He a&s;&s;umed Pope <HI>Innocent</HI>'s name, and &s;eemed re&s;olved to follow his maxims and &s;teps; for he did not &s;eek to rai&s;e his Family; Of which the King told me a con&s;iderable in&s;tance: One of his neare&s;t kindred was then in the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Service in <HI>Flanders;</HI> and ha&s;ted to <HI>Rome</HI> upon his promotion; He received him kindly enough, but pre&s;ently di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him, giving him no other pre&s;ent, if he &s;aid true, but &s;ome &s;nuff. It is true, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> afterwards promoted him: But the Pope took no notice of that.</P>
<P>To return to the Low Countries: The King of <HI>France</HI> re&s;olved to break off the Conferences at the <HI>Hague,</HI> by giving the A|larm of an early Campaign: <HI>Mons</HI> was be&s;ieged; And the King <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Siege of <HI>Mons</HI></NOTE> came before it in per&s;on. It was thereupon given up, as a lo&s;t Place; For the <HI>French</HI> Mini&s;ters had laid that down among their chief maxims, that their King was never to undertake any thing in his own per&s;on, but where he was &s;ure of &s;ucce&s;s. The King broke up the Congre&s;s, and drew a great Army very &s;oon together: And, if the Town had held out &s;o long as, they might well have done, or if the Governour of <HI>Flanders</HI> had per|formed what he undertook, of furni&s;hing Carriages to the Army, the King would either have rai&s;ed the Siege, or forced the <HI>French</HI> to a Battle. But &s;ome Prie&s;ts had been gained by the <HI>French,</HI> who laboured &s;o effectually among the Town&s;men, who were almo&s;t as &s;trong as the Garri&s;on, that they at la&s;t forced the Governour to capitulate. Upon that, both Armies went into Quarters of refre&s;hment: And the King came over again to <HI>England</HI> for a few weeks.</P>
<P>He gave all nece&s;&s;ary Orders for the Campaign in <HI>Ireland;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs set|tled for the next Can+paign</NOTE> in which <HI>Ginkle</HI> had the chief command. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> had the com|mand of the Fleet, which was &s;oon ready, and well manned. The <HI>Dutch</HI> Squadron came over in good time. The proportion of the Quota, &s;ettled between <HI>England</HI> and the <HI>States,</HI> was, that we were to furni&s;h five, and they three Ships of equal rates and &s;trength.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="95">
Affairs in <HI>Scotland</HI> were now brought to &s;ome temper: Many of the Lords, who had been concerned in the late Plot, came up, and confe&s;&s;ed and di&s;covered all, and took out their pardon; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> They excu&s;ed them&s;elves, as apprehending that they were ex|po&s;ed to ruin; and that they dreaded the tyranny of Presbytery, no le&s;s than they did Popery: And they promi&s;ed that, if the King would &s;o balance matters, that the Lord <HI>Melvill,</HI> and his party, &s;hould not have it in their power to ruin them and their friends, and in particular, that they &s;hould not turn out the Mini&s;ters of the Epi&s;copal Per&s;wa&s;ion, who were yet in office, nor force Presbyterians on them, they would engage in the King's Intere&s;ts faithfully and with zeal: They al&s;o undertook to quiet the Highlanders, who &s;tood out &s;till, and were robbing the Country in Parties: And they undertook to the King, that, if the Epi&s;copal Clergy could be a&s;&s;ured of his protection, they would all acknowledge and &s;erve him: They did not de&s;ire, that the King &s;hould make any &s;tep towards the changing the Govern|ment, that was &s;ettled there; They only de&s;ired, that Epi&s;copal Mini&s;ters might continue to &s;erve, in tho&s;e places that liked them be&s;t; and that no man &s;hould be brought into trouble for his opinion, as to the government of the Church; and that &s;uch Epi&s;copal men, as were willing to mix with the Presbyterians in their Judicatories, &s;hould be admitted, without any &s;evere impo&s;ition in point of opinion.</P>
<P>This looked &s;o fair, and agreed &s;o well with the King's own <NOTE PLACE="marg">Some Changes made in <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> &s;en&s;e of things, that he very ea&s;ily hearkned to it; And I did believe that it was &s;incerely meant; &s;o I promoted it with great zeal; tho' we afterwards came to &s;ee, that all this was an arti|fice of the Jacobites, to engage the King to di&s;gu&s;t the Presby|terians; And by lo&s;ing them, or at lea&s;t rendring them remi&s;s in his Service, they reckoned they would be &s;oon Ma&s;ters of that Kingdom. For the party re&s;olved now to come in generally, to take the Oaths; But in order to that, they &s;ent one to King <HI>James,</HI> to &s;hew the nece&s;&s;ity of it, and the &s;ervice they intended him in it; and therefore they asked his leave to take them. That King's an&s;wer was more hone&s;t; He &s;aid, he could not con&s;ent to that, which he thought unlawful; But if any of them took the Oaths on de&s;ign to &s;erve him, and continued to advance his intere&s;ts, he promi&s;ed, it &s;hould never be remembred again&s;t them. Young <HI>Dalrymple</HI> was made conjunct Secretary of State, with the Lord <HI>Melvill;</HI> And he undertook to bring in mo&s;t of the Jacobites to the King's Service; but they entred at the &s;ame time, into a clo&s;e corre&s;pondence with St. <HI>Germains:</HI> I believed
<PB N="75" REF="96">
nothing of all this at that time, but went in cordially to &s;erve many, who intended to betray us.</P>
<P>The truth was, the Presbyterians, by their violence and other fooli&s;h practices, were rendring them&s;elves both odious and con|temptible: They had formed a General A&s;&s;embly, in the end of the former Year, in which they did very much expo&s;e them&s;elves, by the weakne&s;s and peevi&s;hne&s;s of their conduct: Little Learn|ing or Prudence appeared among them; Poor preaching and wretched haranguing; partialities to one another, and violence and inju&s;tice to tho&s;e who differed from them, &s;hewed them|&s;elves in all their Meetings. And the&s;e did &s;o much &s;ink their reputation, that they were weaning the Nation mo&s;t effectually from all fondne&s;s to their Government: But the fal&s;hood of many, who, under a pretence of moderating matters, were really undermining the King's Government, helped in the &s;equel to pre&s;erve the Presbyterians, as much as their own conduct did now alienate the King from them.</P>
<P>The next thing the King did was, to fill the Sees vacant by <NOTE PLACE="marg">The vacant Sees filled.</NOTE> Deprivation. He judged right, that it was of great con&s;equence, both to his Service and to the intere&s;ts of Religion, to have <HI>Canterbury</HI> well filled: for the re&s;t would turn upon that. By the Choice, he was to make, all the Nation would &s;ee, whether he intended to go on, with his fir&s;t de&s;ign of moderating matters, and healing our Breaches, or if he would go into the pa&s;&s;ions and humours of a High Party, that &s;eemed to court him as abjectly, as they inwardly hated him. Dr. <HI>Tillot&s;on</HI> had been now well known to him for two Years; his &s;oft and prudent Coun&s;els, and his zeal for his Service, had begot, both in the King and Queen, a high and ju&s;t opinion of him. They had both, for above a Year, pre&s;&s;ed him to come into this Po&s;t: And he had &s;truggled again&s;t it with great earne&s;tne&s;s: As he had no am|bition, nor a&s;piring in his temper, &s;o he fore&s;aw what a &s;cene of trouble and &s;lander he mu&s;t enter on, now in the decline of his age. The prejudices, that the Jacobites would po&s;&s;e&s;s all people with, for his coming into the room of One, whom they called a Confe&s;&s;or, and who began now to have the publick compa&s;|&s;ion on his &s;ide, were well fore&s;een by him. He al&s;o appre|hended the continuance of that heat and aver&s;ion, that a violent party had always expre&s;&s;ed towards him, tho' he had not only avoided to provoke any of them, but had, upon all occa&s;ions, done the chief of them great &s;ervices, as oft as it was in his Power. He had large Principles, and was free from Super&s;tition; His zeal had been chiefly again&s;t Athei&s;m and Popery: But he had never &s;hewed much &s;harpne&s;s again&s;t the Di&s;&s;enters. He
<PB N="76" REF="97">
had lived in a good corre&s;pondence with many of them: He had brought &s;everal over to the Church, by the force of rea&s;on, and the &s;oftne&s;s of per&s;wa&s;ion and good u&s;age; but was a declared enemy to violence and &s;everities on tho&s;e heads. Among other prejudices again&s;t him, one related to my&s;elf: He and I had lived, for many Years, in a clo&s;e and &s;trict friend&s;hip; He laid before the King all the ill effects, that, as he thought, the pro|moting him would have on his own Service: But all this had &s;erved only to increa&s;e the King's e&s;teem of him, and fix him in his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop of <HI>Ely</HI>'s Letters to St. <HI>Germains,</HI> gave &s;o fair an occa&s;ion of filling tho&s;e Sees, at this time, that the King re&s;olved <NOTE PLACE="marg">Many Pro|motions in the Church.</NOTE> to lay hold on it: And <HI>Tillot&s;on,</HI> with great unea&s;ine&s;s to him&s;elf, &s;ubmitted to the King's command: And &s;oon after, the See of <HI>York</HI> falling void, Dr. <HI>Sharp</HI> was promoted to it: So tho&s;e two Sees were filled with the two be&s;t Preachers, that had &s;at in them in our time: Only <HI>Sharp</HI> did not know the World &s;o well, and was not &s;o &s;teady as <HI>Tillot&s;on</HI> was. Dr. <HI>Patrick</HI> was ad|vanced to <HI>Ely,</HI> Dr. <HI>More</HI> was made Bi&s;hop of <HI>Norwich,</HI> Dr. <HI>Cumberland</HI> was made Bi&s;hop of <HI>Peterborow,</HI> Dr. <HI>Fowler</HI> was made Bi&s;hop of <HI>Gloce&s;ter, Iron&s;ide</HI> was promoted to <HI>Hereford, Grove</HI> to <HI>Chiche&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Hall</HI> to <HI>Bri&s;tol;</HI> as <HI>Hough,</HI> the Pre|&s;ident of <HI>Magdalen</HI>'s, was the Year before this, made Bi&s;hop of <HI>Oxford.</HI> So that in two Years time, the King had named fifteen Bi&s;hops; And they were generally looked on as the learnede&s;t, the wi&s;e&s;t, and be&s;t men, that were in the Church. It was vi&s;ible, that in all the&s;e nominations, and the filling the inferior Dig|nities, that became void by their promotion, no ambition, nor Court favour, had appeared; Men were not &s;crambling for Preferment, nor u&s;ing arts, or employing friends to &s;et them forward; On the contrary, men were &s;ought &s;or, and brought out of their Retirements; And mo&s;t of them very much again&s;t their own inclinations: They were men both of moderate Prin|ciples and of calm tempers: This great promotion was &s;uch a di&s;covery of the King and Queen's de&s;igns, with relation to the Church, that it &s;erved much to remove the jealou&s;ies, that &s;ome other &s;teps the King had made, were beginning to rai&s;e in the Whigs, and very much &s;oftned the ill humour, that was &s;pread among them.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as this was over; the King went back to command <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cam|paign in <HI>Flanders</HI></NOTE> his Army in <HI>Flanders.</HI> Both Armies were now making ha&s;te to take the Field. But the <HI>French</HI> were quicker than the Confederates had yet learned to be. Prince <HI>Waldeck</HI> had not got above eighteen thou&s;and men together, when <HI>Luxemburg,</HI>
<PB N="77" REF="98">
with an Army of forty thou&s;and men, was marching to have &s;urprized <HI>Bru&s;&s;els:</HI> And at the &s;ame time, <HI>Bouflers,</HI> with an|other Army, came up to <HI>Liege. Waldeck</HI> po&s;ted his Army &s;o well, that <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> believing it &s;tronger than indeed it was, did not attempt to break through, in which it was believed he might have &s;ucceeded. The King ha&s;tned the re&s;t of the Troops, and came him&s;elf to the Army in good time, not only to cover <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> but to &s;end a detachment to the relief of <HI>Liege;</HI> which had been bombarded for two days. A Body of <HI>Germans,</HI> as well as that which the King &s;ent to them, came in good time to &s;upport tho&s;e of <HI>Liege,</HI> who were beginning to think of Capitulating. So <HI>Bouflers</HI> drew off; And the <HI>French</HI> kept them&s;elves &s;o clo&s;e in their Po&s;ts, all the re&s;t of the Cam|paign, that though the King made many motions, to try if it was po&s;&s;ible to bring them to a Battle, yet he could not do it. Signal pre&s;ervations of his per&s;on did again &s;hew, that he had a watchful Providence &s;till guarding him. Once he had &s;tood under a tree for &s;ome time, which the Enemy ob&s;erving, they levelled a Cannon &s;o exactly, that the tree was &s;hot down two minutes after the King was gone from the place. There was one, that belonged to the train of Artillery, who was corrupted to &s;et fire to the Magazine of powder: And he fired the matches of three Bombs, two of the&s;e blew up, without doing any mi&s;chief, tho' there were twenty four more Bombs in the &s;ame Waggon, on which they lay, together with a Barrel of powder: The third Bomb was found, with the match fired, before it had its effect. If this wicked practice had &s;ucceeded, the confu&s;ion, that was in all rea&s;on to be expected, upon &s;uch an accident, while the Enemy was not above a League from them, drawn up, and looking for the &s;ucce&s;s of it, mu&s;t have had terrible effects. It cannot be ea&s;ily imagined, how much mi&s;chief might have followed upon it, in the mere de&s;truction of &s;o many as would have peri&s;hed immediately, if the whole Magazine had taken fire; as well as in the pannick fear, with which the re&s;t would have been &s;truck upon &s;o terrible an accident; by the &s;urprize of it, the <HI>French</HI> might have had an opportunity to have cut off the whole Army. This may well be reckoned one of the Miracles of Providence, that &s;o little harm was done, when &s;o much was &s;o near being done. The two Armies lay along between the <HI>Samber</HI> and the <HI>Mae&s;e:</HI> But no Action followed. When the time came of going into Quarters, the King le&s;t the Armies in Prince <HI>Wal|deck</HI>'s hands, who was ob&s;erved not to march off with that caution, that might have been expected from &s;o old a Captain:
<PB N="78" REF="99">
<HI>Luxemburgh</HI> upon that drew out his Hor&s;e, with the King's Hou&s;hold, de&s;igning to cut off his Rear; And did, upon the fir&s;t &s;urprize, put them into &s;ome di&s;order; But they made &s;o good a &s;tand, that, after a very hot action, the <HI>French</HI> marched off, and lo&s;t more men on their &s;ide than we did. <HI>Auverquerque</HI> commanded the Body, that did this &s;ervice: And with it the Campaign ended in <HI>Flanders.</HI></P>
<P>Matters went on at Sea with the &s;ame caution. <HI>Dunkirk</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs at Sea.</NOTE> was for &s;ome time block'd up by a Squadron of ours. The great Fleet went to find out the <HI>French;</HI> But they had Orders to avoid an Engagement: And, though for the &s;pace of two months, <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> did all he could to come up to them, yet they &s;till kept at a di&s;tance, and &s;ailed off in the night: So that, though he was &s;ometimes in view of them, yet he lo&s;t it next day. The trading part of the Nation was very apprehen&s;ive of the danger the <HI>Smirna</HI> Fleet might be in, in which the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Effects together, were valued at four millions: for, tho' they had a great Convoy, yet the <HI>French</HI> Fleet &s;tood out to intercept them: But they got &s;afe into <HI>Kin&s;ale.</HI> The Sea&s;on went over without any Action; And <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> at the end of it, came into <HI>Plymouth</HI> in a Storm: which was much cen&s;ured; for that Road is not &s;afe: and two con&s;iderable Ships were lo&s;t upon the occa&s;ion. Great Factions were among the Flag Offi|cers: And no other Service was done by this great Equipment, but that our Trade was maintained.</P>
<P>But, while we had no &s;ucce&s;s, either in <HI>Flanders</HI> or at Sea, we were more happy in <HI>Ireland,</HI> even beyond expectation. The <NOTE PLACE="marg">$para$</NOTE> Campaign was opened with the taking of <HI>Baltimore,</HI> on which the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> had wrought much, that <HI>Athlone</HI> might be covered by it: We took it in one day; and the Garri&s;on had only Am|munition for a day more. St. <HI>Ruth,</HI> one of the violente&s;t of all the Per&s;ecutors of the Prote&s;tants in <HI>France,</HI> was &s;ent over with two hundred Officers to command the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Army: This fir&s;t action reflected much on his Conduct, who left a thou&s;and men, with &s;o &s;lender a provi&s;ion of Ammunition, that they were all made Pri&s;oners of War. From thence <HI>Ginkle</HI> advanc'd to <HI>Athline,</HI> where St. <HI>Ruth</HI> was po&s;ted on the other &s;ide of the <HI>Shannon,</HI> with an Army in number equal to his: The River was deep, but fordable in &s;everal places: The Ca&s;tle was &s;oon turned to a muin by the Cannon: But the pa&s;&s;ing the River, in the face of an Enemy, was no ea&s;y thing, the Ford being &s;o narrow, that they could not pa&s;s above twenty in front: Parties were &s;ent out to try other Fords, which probably made the Enemy imagine, that they never intended to pa&s;s the River, ju&s;t
<PB N="79" REF="100">
under the Town, where the Ford was both deep and narrow. <HI>Talma&s;h,</HI> a General Officer, moved, that two Battallions might have Guineas apiece to encourage them; And he offered to march over at the Head of them; which was pre&s;ently executed by <HI>Mackay,</HI> with &s;o much re&s;olution, that many ancient Officers &s;aid, it was the gallante&s;t action they had ever &s;een. They pa&s;t the River, and went through the Breaches into the Town, with <NOTE PLACE="marg">Athlore <HI>taken.</HI></NOTE> the lo&s;s only of fifty men, having killed above a thou&s;and of the Enemy; And yet they &s;pared all, that asked quarter. St. <HI>Ruth</HI> did not, upon this occa&s;ion, act &s;uitably to the reputa|tion he had formerly acquired; He retired to <HI>Aghrem;</HI> where he po&s;ted him&s;elf to great advantage, and was much &s;uperior to <HI>Ginkle</HI> in number; for he had abandoned many &s;mall Garri&s;ons, to increa&s;e his Army, which was now twenty eight thou&s;and &s;trong; whereas <HI>Ginkle</HI> had not above twenty thou&s;and; &s;o that the attacking him was no advi&s;able thing, if the courage of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and the cowardice of the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> had not made a difference &s;o con&s;iderable, as neither numbers nor po&s;ts could balance.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Ruth</HI> had indeed taken the mo&s;t effectual way po&s;&s;ible to infu&s;e courage into the <HI>Iri&s;h:</HI> He had &s;ent their Prie&s;ts <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Battle of $word$.</NOTE> about among them, to animate them by all the methods they could think of: And, as the mo&s;t powerful of all others, they made them &s;wear on the Sacrament, that they would never for&s;ake their Colours. This had a great effect on them: For as, when <HI>Ginkle</HI> fell on them, they had a great Bog before them; and the Grounds on both &s;ides were very favourable to them: With tho&s;e advantages, they maintained their Ground much longer, than they had been accu&s;tomed to do. They di&s;puted the matter &s;o ob&s;tinately, that for about two hours the Action was very hot, and every Battalion and Squadron, on both &s;ides, had a &s;hare in it. But nature will be always too &s;trong for art; The <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> in conclu&s;ion, tru&s;ted more to their heels, than to their hands; The Foot threw down their Arms, and ran away. St. <HI>Ruth,</HI> and many more Officers, were killed, and about eight thou&s;and Soldiers, and all their Cannon and Baggage was taken. So that it was a total Defeat; Only the night favoured a Body of Hor&s;e, that got off. From thence <HI>Ginkle</HI> advanced to <HI>Gal|loway,</HI> which capitulated; &s;o that now <HI>Limerick</HI> was the only place that &s;tood out; A Squadron of Ships was &s;ent to &s;hut up the River. In the mean while, the Lords Ju&s;tices i&s;&s;ued out a new Proclamation, with an offer of life and e&s;tate, to &s;uch as, within a fortnight, &s;hould come under the King's Protection.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="101">
<HI>Ginkle</HI> pur&s;ued his advantages: And, having reduced all <HI>Con|naught,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1691 <HI>Limerick</HI> be&s;ieged.</NOTE> he came and &s;at down before <HI>Limerick,</HI> and bom|barded it; But that had no great effect; And though mo&s;t of the hou&s;es were beat down, yet as long as the <HI>Connaught</HI> &s;ide was open, fre&s;h men and provi&s;ions were &s;till brought into the place. When the Men of War were come up, near the Town, <HI>Ginkle</HI> &s;ent over a part of his Army to the <HI>Connaught</HI> &s;ide, who fell upon &s;ome Bodies of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> that lay there, and broke them; and pur&s;ued them &s;o clo&s;e, as they retired to <HI>Limerick,</HI> that the <HI>French</HI> Governour <HI>D'u&s;&s;on,</HI> fearing that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> would have come in with them, drew up the Bridge; &s;o that many of them were killed and drowned. This contributed very much to|wards heightning the prejudices, that the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> had again&s;t the <HI>French.</HI> The latter were &s;o incon&s;iderable, that, if <HI>Sarsfield</HI> and &s;ome of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> had not joined with them, they could not have made their party good. The Earl of <HI>Tyrconnell</HI> had, with a particular view, &s;tudied to divert the <HI>French,</HI> from &s;ending over Soldiers into <HI>Ireland;</HI> For he de&s;igned, in ca&s;e of new misfortunes, to treat with the King, and to pre&s;erve him&s;elf and his friends; And now he began to di&s;po&s;e the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> to think of treating; &s;ince they &s;aw that otherwi&s;e their ruin was inevi|table. But as &s;oon as this was &s;u&s;pected, all the military men, who re&s;olved to give them&s;elves up entirely to the <HI>French</HI> In|tere&s;t, combined again&s;t him, and bla&s;ted him as a feeble and fal&s;e man, who was not to be tru&s;ted. This was carried &s;o far; that to avoid affronts, he was advi&s;ed to leave the Army: And he &s;taid all this Summer at <HI>Limerick,</HI> where he died of grief, as was believed: But before he died, he advi&s;ed all that came to him, not to let things go to extremities, but to accept of &s;uch terms as could be got: And his words &s;eemed to weigh more after his death, than in his life-time: For the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> began ge|nerally to &s;ay, that they mu&s;t take care of them&s;elves, and not be made &s;acrifices to &s;erve the ends of the <HI>French.</HI> This was much heightned, by the &s;laughter of the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> whom the <HI>French</HI> Governor had &s;hut out, and left to peri&s;h. They wanted no provi&s;ions in <HI>Limerick.</HI> And a Squadron of <HI>French</HI> Ships &s;tood over to that Coa&s;t, which was much &s;tronger than ours, that had &s;ailed up to the Town. So it was to be feared, that they might come into the River to de&s;troy our Ships.</P>
<P>To hinder that, another Squadron of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men of War was ordered thither. Yet the <HI>French</HI> did not think fit to venture their Ships within the <HI>Shannon,</HI> where they had no places of &s;helter; The mi&s;under&s;tanding that daily grew, between the
<PB N="81" REF="102">
<HI>Iri&s;h</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> was great; And all appearance of relief from <HI>France</HI> failing, made them re&s;olve to capitulate. This was very welcome to <HI>Ginkle</HI> and his Army, who began to be in great wants; For that Country was quite wa&s;ted, having been the Seat of War for three Years: And all their draught-hor&s;es were &s;o wearied out, that their Camp was often ill &s;upplied.</P>
<P>When they came to capitulate, the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> in&s;i&s;ted on very high <NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Capitulate</NOTE> demands; which was &s;et on by the <HI>French,</HI> who hoped they would be rejected: But the King had given <HI>Ginkle</HI> &s;ecret di|rections, that he &s;hould grant all the demands they could make, that would put an end to that War: So every thing was granted, to the great di&s;appointment of the <HI>French,</HI> and the no &s;mall grief of &s;ome of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who hoped this War &s;hould have ended in the total ruine of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t. During the Treaty, a &s;aying of <HI>Sarsfield</HI>'s de&s;erves to be remembred; for it was much talked of, all <HI>Europe</HI> over. He asked &s;ome of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Officers, if they had not come to a better opinion of the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> by their behaviour during this War; And, whereas they &s;aid, it was much the &s;ame, that it had always been; <HI>Sarsfield</HI> an|&s;wered, as low as we now are, change but Kings with us, and we will fight it over again with you. Tho&s;e of <HI>Limerick</HI> treated, not only for them&s;elves, but for all the re&s;t of their Countrymen, that were yet in Arms. They were all indem|nified and re&s;tored to all, that they had enjoyed in King <HI>Charles</HI>'s time. They were al&s;o admitted to all the Privileges of Subjects, upon their taking the Oaths of Allegiance to their Maje&s;ties, without being bound to take the Oath of Supremacy. Not only the <HI>French,</HI> but as many of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> as had a mind to go over to <HI>France,</HI> had free liberty, and a &s;afe tran&s;portation. And upon that, about twelve thou&s;and of them went over.</P>
<P>And thus ended the War of <HI>Ireland:</HI> And with that our <NOTE PLACE="marg">The War there at an end.</NOTE> Civil War came to a final end. The Articles of Capitulation were punctually executed; and &s;ome doubts that aro&s;e, out of &s;ome ambiguous words, were explained in favour of the <HI>Iri&s;h.</HI> So earne&s;tly de&s;irous was the King to have all matters quieted at home, that he might direct his whole force again&s;t the Ene|my abroad. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> tho' none could &s;uffer more, by the continuance of the War, than they did, yet were unea&s;y, when they &s;aw that the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> had obtained &s;uch good conditions; Some of the more violent men among them, who were much exa&s;perated with the wrongs, that had been done them, began to call in que&s;tion the legality of &s;ome of the Articles: But the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> did not think fit to enter upon that di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; Nor made they any motions to|wards

the violating the Capitulation. <HI>Ginkle</HI> came over full of honour, after &s;o glorious a Campaign, and was made Earl of <HI>Athlone,</HI> and had noble rewards for the great Service he had done; though, without detracting from him, a large &s;hare of all that was done, was due to &s;ome of the General Officers, in particular to <HI>Rouvigny,</HI> made upon this Earl of <HI>Gallway,</HI> to <HI>Mackay,</HI> and <HI>Tallma&s;h.</HI> Old <HI>Rouvigny</HI> being dead, his Son offered his Service to the King, who unwillingly accepted of it; becau&s;e he knew that an e&s;tate, which his Fa|ther had in <HI>France,</HI> and of which, he had &s;till the income, would be immediately confi&s;cated: But he had no regard to that, and heartily engaged in the King's Service, and has been ever &s;ince employed in many eminent Po&s;ts; in all which he has acquitted him&s;elf with that great reputation, both for Capacity, Integrity, Courage, and Application, as well as Suc|ce&s;s in mo&s;t of his Undertakings, that he is ju&s;tly reckoned among the great men of the Age: And to crown all, he is a man of eminent Vertues, great Piety, and Zeal for Religion.</P>
<P>The Emperor's affairs in <HI>Hungary</HI> went on &s;ucce&s;sfully this <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in <HI>Hungary.</HI></NOTE> Year, under the command of Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Baden;</HI> tho' he committed an error, that was like to have proved fatal to him: His &s;tores lay near him, in great boats on the <HI>Danube:</HI> But upon &s;ome de&s;ign, he made a motion off from that River; Of which the Grand <HI>Vizier</HI> took the advantage, and got into his Camp, between him and his &s;tores; &s;o he mu&s;t either &s;tarve, or break through to come at his provi&s;ions. The <HI>Turks</HI> had not time to fortify them&s;elves in their new Camp: So he at|tacked them with &s;uch fury, that they were quite routed, and lo&s;t Camp and Cannon, and a great part of their Army; The Grand <HI>Vizier</HI> him&s;elf being killed. If the Court of <HI>Vienna</HI> had really de&s;ired a Peace, they might have had it, upon this Vic|tory, on very ea&s;y terms: But they re&s;olved they would be Ma&s;ters of all <HI>Tran&s;ilvania;</HI> And, in order to that, they under|took the Siege of <HI>Great Waradin,</HI> which they were forced to turn to a Blockade: So that it fell not into their hands till the Spring following. The Emperor was led on by the Prophecies, that a&s;&s;ured him of con&s;tant Conque&s;ts, and that he &s;hould, in conclu&s;ion, arrive at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> it&s;elf: So that the prac|tices of tho&s;e, whom the <HI>French</HI> had gained about him, had but too much matter to work on in him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The news of the total reduction of <HI>Ireland,</HI> confirmed him in his re&s;olutions, of carrying on the War in <HI>Hungary.</HI> It was <NOTE PLACE="marg">$para$</NOTE> reckoned that <HI>England,</HI> being now di&s;engaged at home, would, with the re&s;t of the Prote&s;tant Allies, be able to carry on the
<PB N="83" REF="104">
War with <HI>France.</HI> And the two chief pa&s;&s;ions in the Empe|ror's mind, being his hatred of Here&s;y, and his hatred of <HI>France,</HI> it was &s;aid, that tho&s;e about him, who &s;erved the intere&s;ts of that Court, per&s;waded him that he was to let the War go on be|tween <HI>France,</HI> and tho&s;e he e&s;teemed Hereticks; Since he would be a gainer, which &s;ide &s;oever &s;hould lo&s;e; either <HI>France</HI> would be humbled, or the Hereticks be exhau&s;ted; while he &s;hould extend his Dominions, and conquer Infidels: The King had a &s;ort of regard and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Emperor, that he had to no other Prince what&s;oever: So that he did not pre&s;s him, as many de&s;ired he &s;hould, to accept of a Peace with the <HI>Turks,</HI> that &s;o he might turn his whole force again&s;t <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Germany</HI> was now more entirely united in one common in|tere&s;t <NOTE PLACE="marg">The State of the Empire.</NOTE> than ever: The third party, that the <HI>French</HI> had formed, to ob&s;truct the War, were now gone off from tho&s;e mea&s;ures, and engaged in the general intere&s;t of the Empire: The two Northern Kings had &s;ome &s;atisfaction given them, in point of Trade, that &s;o they might maintain their neutrality: And they were favourable to the Allies, though not engaged with them. The King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> whom the <HI>French</HI> were pre&s;&s;ing to offer his mediation for a Peace, wrote to the Duke of <HI>Hannover,</HI> a&s;&s;uring him, he would never hearken to that propo&s;ition, till he had full a&s;&s;urances from the <HI>French,</HI> that they would own the pre|&s;ent Government of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>That Duke, who had been long in a <HI>French</HI> management, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Ninth E|lector creat|ed.</NOTE> did now break off all commerce with that Court, and enter'd into a Treaty, both with the Emperor and with the King: He promi&s;ed great &s;upplies again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> and the <HI>Turk,</HI> if he might be made an Elector of the Empire; In which the King concurred to pre&s;s the matter &s;o earne&s;tly, at the Court of <HI>Vienna,</HI> that they agreed to it, in ca&s;e he could gain the con&s;ent of the other Electors; which the Emperor's Mini&s;ters re|&s;olved to oppo&s;e, underhand, all they could. He quickly gained the con&s;ent of the greater number of the Electors; Yet new objec|tions were &s;till made. It was &s;aid, that if this was granted, another Electorate in a <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Family, ought al&s;o to be created, to balance the advantage that this gave the <HI>Lutherans:</HI> And they moved that <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> &s;hould be made an Electorate. But this was &s;o much oppo&s;ed, &s;ince it gave the Emperor two Votes in the E|lectoral College, that it was let fall. In conclu&s;ion, after a Year's negotiation, and a great oppo&s;ition, both by Popi&s;h and Prote&s;tant Princes, (&s;ome of the latter, con&s;idering more their jealou&s;ies of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hannover,</HI> than the intere&s;t of their Religion,) the Inve&s;titure was given, with the Title of Elector
<PB N="84" REF="105">
of <HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> and Great Mar&s;hal of the Empire. The <HI>French</HI> oppo&s;ed this, with all the artifices they could &s;et at work. The matter lay long in an un&s;ettled &s;tate; Nor was he now admitted into the College; it being &s;aid, that the unanimous con&s;ent of all the Electors mu&s;t be fir&s;t had.</P>
<P>The Affairs of <HI>Savoy</HI> did not go on &s;o pro&s;perou&s;ly as was <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in $word$.</NOTE> hoped for: <HI>Caraffa,</HI> that commanded the Imperial Army, was more intent on rai&s;ing Contributions, than on carrying on the War: He cro&s;&s;ed every good motion that was made: <HI>Montme|lian</HI> was lo&s;t, which was chiefly imputed to <HI>Caraffa;</HI> The young Duke of <HI>Schomberg,</HI> &s;ent thither to command tho&s;e Troops, that the King paid, undertook to relieve the place, and was a&s;&s;ured that many Prote&s;tants in <HI>Dauphiny,</HI> would come and join him. But <HI>Caraffa,</HI> and indeed the Court of <HI>Turin,</HI> &s;eemed to be more afraid of the &s;trength of Here&s;y, than of the Power of <HI>France;</HI> and cho&s;e to let that important place fall into their hands, rather than &s;uffer it to be relieved by tho&s;e they did not like. When the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI>'s Army went into Quarters, <HI>Caraffa</HI> obliged the neighbouring Princes, and the State of <HI>Genoa,</HI> to contribute to the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the Imperial Army, threatning them otherwi&s;e with Winter Quarters: So that how ill &s;oever he managed the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI>'s concerns, he took care of his own. He was recalled, upon the Complaints made again&s;t him on all hands; and <HI>Caprara</HI> was &s;ent to command in his room.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t danger lay in <HI>Flanders,</HI> where the feeblene&s;s of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Elector of <HI>$word$</HI> commanded $n <HI>Flanders</HI></NOTE> the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Government, did &s;o exhau&s;t and weaken the whole Country, that all the &s;trength of the Confederate Armies was &s;carce able to defend it: The <HI>Spaniards</HI> had offered to deliver it up to the King, either as he was King of <HI>England,</HI> or as he was Stadtholder of the United Provinces. He knew the bigotry of the people &s;o well, that he was convinced, it was not po&s;&s;ible to get them to &s;ubmit to a Prote&s;tant Government; But he pro|po&s;ed the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> who &s;eemed to have much heat, and an ambition of &s;ignalizing him&s;elf in that Country, which was then the chief &s;eene of War: And he could &s;upport that Government by the Troops and Trea&s;ure, that he might draw out of his Electorate: Be&s;ides, if he governed that Country well, and acquired a fame in Arms, that might give him a Pro&s;|pect of &s;ucceeding to the Crown of <HI>Spain,</HI> in the right of his Electore&s;s, who, if the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon</HI> was &s;et a&s;ide, was next in that Succe&s;&s;ion. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> agreed to this Propo&s;al; But they would not make the fir&s;t offer of it to that Elector, nor would he ask it; and it &s;tuck for &s;ome time at this: But the
<PB N="85" REF="106">
Court of <HI>Vienna</HI> adju&s;ted the matter, by making the propo&s;ition, which the Elector accepted: And that put a new life into tho&s;e oppre&s;&s;ed and mi&s;erable Provinces.</P>
<P>This was the general &s;tate of affairs, when a new Se&s;&s;ion of <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament.</NOTE> Parliament was opened at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> and then it appeared, that a Party was avowedly formed again&s;t the Government. They dur&s;t not own that before, while the War of <HI>Ireland</HI> con|tinued. But now, &s;ince that was at an end, they began to infu&s;e into all people, that there was no need of keeping up a great Land Army, and that we ought only to a&s;&s;i&s;t our Allies, with &s;ome auxiliary Troops, and increa&s;e our force at Sea. Many that under&s;tood not the &s;tate of foreign affairs, were drawn into this conceit; not con&s;idering, that if <HI>Flanders</HI> was lo&s;t, <HI>Holland</HI> mu&s;t &s;ubmit, and take the be&s;t terms they could get. And the conjunction of tho&s;e two great Powers at Sea, mu&s;t pre&s;ently ruine our Trade, and in a little time &s;ubdue us entirely. But it was not ea&s;y to bring all people to apprehend this aright; And tho&s;e who had ill intentions, would not be beaten out of it, but covered wor&s;e de&s;igns with this pretence: And this was &s;till kept up as a prejudice, again&s;t the King and his Government, that he loved to have a great Army about him; and that when they were once modelled, he would never part with them, but govern in an arbitrary way, as &s;oon as he had prepared his Sol|diers to &s;erve his ends.</P>
<P>Another prejudice had more colour, and as bad effects. The <NOTE PLACE="marg">Jealou&s;ies of the King.</NOTE> King was thought to love the <HI>Dutch</HI> more than the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> to tru&s;t more to them, and to admit them to more freedom with him. He gave too much occa&s;ion to a general di&s;gu&s;t, which was &s;pread both among the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Officers, and the Nobility: He took little pains to gain the affections of the Nation; Nor did he con&s;train him&s;elf enough to render his Government more acceptable: He was &s;hut up all the day long; And his &s;ilence, when he admitted any to an audience, di&s;ta&s;ted them as much, as if they had been denied it. The Earl of <HI>Marlborough</HI> thought, that the great &s;ervices he had done, were not acknowledged nor rewarded, as they well de&s;erved; and began to &s;peak like a man di&s;contented. And the &s;train of all the Nation almo&s;t was, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were overlooked, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> were the only per&s;ons favoured or tru&s;ted. This was National; And the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> being too apt to de&s;pi&s;e other Nations, and being of more lively tempers than the <HI>Dutch,</HI> grew to expre&s;s a contempt and an aver&s;ion for them, that went almo&s;t to a mutiny. It is true, the <HI>Dutch</HI> behaved them&s;elves &s;o well, and &s;o regularly in their Quarters, and paid for every thing &s;o punctually, whereas the
<PB N="86" REF="107">
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were apt to be rude and exacting; e&s;pecially tho&s;e who were all this Winter coming over from <HI>Ireland,</HI> who had been &s;o long in an Enemy's Country, that they were not ea&s;ily brought into order; &s;o that the common people were generally better plea&s;ed with the <HI>Dutch</HI> Soldiers, than with their own Countrymen, but it was not the &s;ame as to the Officers. The&s;e &s;eeds of di&s;|content, were carefully managed by the Enemies of the Govern|ment; And by tho&s;e means, matters went on heavily in the Hou&s;e of Commons. The King was al&s;o believed to be &s;o ten|der, in every point that &s;eemed to relate to his Prerogative, that he could not well bear any thing, that was a diminution of it: And he was &s;aid to have taken a di&s;like and mi&s;tru&s;t of all tho&s;e, who&s;e notions leaned to publick Liberty, tho' tho&s;e were the per&s;ons that were the firme&s;t to him, and the mo&s;t zealous for him. The men, who&s;e notions of the Prerogative were the highe&s;t, were &s;u&s;pected to be Jacobites: Yet it was ob&s;erved, that many of the&s;e were much courted, and put into Employments, in which they &s;hewed &s;o little af|fection to the Government, and &s;o clo&s;e a Corre&s;pondence with its profe&s;&s;ed Enemies, that it was generally believed they intended to betray it. The blame of employing the&s;e men, was ca&s;t on the Earl of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> who, as the Whigs &s;aid, infu&s;ed into the King Jealou&s;ies of his be&s;t Friends, and inclined him to court &s;ome of his bittere&s;t Enemies.</P>
<P>The taking off Parliament men, who complained of griev|ances, by Places and Pen&s;ions, was believed to be now very ge|nerally <NOTE PLACE="marg">1692</NOTE> practi&s;ed. <HI>Seimour,</HI> who had, in a very injurious man|ner, not only oppo&s;ed every thing, but had reflected on the King's Title and Conduct, was this Winter brought into the Trea&s;ury, and the Cabinet Council: Yet tho' a great oppo&s;ition was made, and many delays contrived, all the money that was asked was at length given. Among the Bills that were offered to the King, at the end of the Se&s;&s;ion, one was to &s;ecure the Judges Salaries; and to put it out of the King's power to &s;top them. The Judges had their Com|mi&s;&s;ion, during their good behaviour; Yet their Salaries were not &s;o &s;ecured to them, but that the&s;e were at the King's plea|&s;ure. But the King put a &s;top to this, and refu&s;ed to pa&s;s the Bill: for it was repre&s;ented to him, by &s;ome of the Judges them&s;elves, that it was not fit they &s;hould be out of all depen|dence on the Court; tho' it did not appear, that there was any hurt in making Judges, in all re&s;pects, free and independent. A Parliament was &s;ummoned to meet in <HI>Ireland,</HI> to annul all that
<PB N="87" REF="108">
had pa&s;&s;ed in King <HI>James</HI>'s Parliament; to confirm anew the Act of Settlement; and to do all other things, that the broken &s;tate of that impoveri&s;hed I&s;land required, and to grant &s;uch Supplies, as they could rai&s;e, and as the &s;tate of their affairs would permit.</P>
<P>Affairs in <HI>Scotland</HI> were put in another method; Lord <HI>Twee|dale</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> was made Lord Chancellor, and not long after a Marqui&s;s in that Kingdom: Lord <HI>Melvill</HI> was put in a le&s;s important Po&s;t; And mo&s;t of his creatures were laid a&s;ide; But &s;everal of tho&s;e, who had been in <HI>Montgomery</HI>'s Plot, were brought into the Council and Mini&s;try. <HI>John&s;toun,</HI> who had been &s;ent Envoy to the Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> was called home, and made Secretary of State for that Kingdom: It began &s;oon to appear in <HI>Scotland,</HI> how ill the King was advi&s;ed, when he brought in &s;ome of the Plotters into the chief Po&s;ts of that Government; As this di&s;gu&s;ted the Presbyterians, &s;o it was very vi&s;ible, that tho&s;e pretended Converts came into his Service, only to have it in their power, to deliver up that Kingdom to King <HI>James:</HI> They &s;carce di&s;gui&s;ed their de&s;igns; So that the tru&s;ting &s;uch men amazed all people. The Presbyterians had very much of|fended the King, and their fury was in&s;trumental in rai&s;ing great Jealou&s;ies of him in <HI>England:</HI> He well fore&s;aw the ill effects this was like to have; And therefore he recommended to a General A&s;&s;embly, that met this Winter, to receive the Epi&s;|copal Clergy, to concur with them, in the Government of the Church, upon their de&s;iring to be admitted: And in ca&s;e the A&s;&s;embly could not be brought to con&s;ent to this, the King or|dered it to be di&s;&s;olved, without naming any other time or place of meeting. It was not likely, that there could be any agree|ment, where both Parties were &s;o much inflamed one again&s;t another; And tho&s;e, who had the greate&s;t credit with both, &s;tudied rather to exa&s;perate, than to &s;often them. The Epi&s;copal Party carried it high; They gave it out, that the King was now theirs; and that they were willing to come to a concurrence with Presbytery, on de&s;ign to bring all about to Epi&s;copacy, in a little time: The Presbyterians, who at all times were &s;tiff and peevi&s;h, were more than ordinarily &s;o at this time: They were jealous of the King; Their Friends were now di&s;graced, and their bittere&s;t Enemies were coming into favour: So they were &s;urly, and would abate in no point of their Government: And upon that, the A&s;&s;embly was di&s;&s;olved. But they pretended, that by Law they had a right to an Annual meeting, from which nothing could cut them off; for they &s;aid, according to a di&s;|tinction much u&s;ed among them, that the King's power of
<PB N="88" REF="109">
calling Synods and A&s;&s;emblies was cumulative, and not pri|vative; That is, he might call them if he would, and appoint time and place; but that, if he did not call them, they might meet by an inherent right that the Church had, which was confirmed by Law: Therefore they adjourned them&s;elves. This was repre&s;ented to the King as a high &s;train of in&s;olence, that invaded the Rights of the Crown, of which he was become very &s;en&s;ible: Mo&s;t of tho&s;e, who came now into his Service, made it their bu&s;ine&s;s to incen&s;e him again&s;t the Presbyterians, in which he was &s;o far engaged, that it did alienate that party much from him.</P>
<P>There was, at this time, a very barbarous Ma&s;&s;acre committed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> which &s;hewed both the cruelty and the treachery of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Affair or <HI>Glencoe.</HI></NOTE> &s;ome of tho&s;e, who had unhappily in&s;inuated them&s;elves, into the King's Confidence: The Earl of <HI>Braidalbin</HI> formed a Scheme of quieting all the Highlanders, if the King would give twelve or fifteen thou&s;and pounds for doing it, which was remitted down from <HI>England;</HI> And this was to be divided among the Heads of the Tribes, or Clanns of the Highlanders. He em|ployed his Emi&s;&s;aries among them, and told them, the be&s;t &s;ervice they could do King <HI>James,</HI> was to lie quiet, and re&s;erve them&s;elves to a better time; And if they would take the Oaths, the King would be contented with that, and they were to have a &s;hare of this &s;um, that was &s;ent down to buy their quiet; But this came to nothing; Their demands ro&s;e high; They knew this Lord had money to di&s;tribute among them; They believed he intended to keep the be&s;t part of it to him&s;elf; So they asked more than he could give: Among the mo&s;t cla|morous and ob&s;tinate of the&s;e, were the <HI>Mackdonalds</HI> of <HI>Glencoe,</HI> who were believed guilty of much robbery, and many murders; And &s;o had gained too much by their pil&s;ering War, to be ea&s;ily brought to give it over. The head of that Vally had &s;o par|ticularly provoked Lord <HI>Braidalbin,</HI> that as his Scheme was quite defeated, by the oppo&s;ition that he rai&s;ed, &s;o he de&s;igned a &s;evere revenge. The King had, by a Proclamation, offered an indemnity to all the Highlanders, that had been in Arms again&s;t him, upon their coming in, by a prefixed day, to take the Oaths; The day had been twice or thrice prolonged; And it was at la&s;t carried to the end of the Year 1691; with a po&s;itive threatning, of proceeding to military execution, again&s;t &s;uch as &s;hould not come into his obedience, by the la&s;t day of <HI>December.</HI></P>
<P>All were &s;o terrified, that they came in; and even that <HI>Macdonald</HI> went to the Governor of Fort <HI>William,</HI> on the la&s;t
<PB N="89" REF="110">
of <HI>December,</HI> and offered to take the Oaths; But he, being only a military man, could not, or would not tender them; And <HI>Macdonald</HI> was forced to &s;eek for &s;ome of the Legal Magi&s;trates, to tender them to him. The Snows were then fallen, &s;o four or five days pa&s;&s;ed, before he could come to a Magi&s;trate; He took the Oaths in his pre&s;ence, on the fourth or fifth of <HI>January,</HI> when, by the &s;trictne&s;s of Law, he could claim no benefit by it; The matter was &s;ignified to the Council; and the per&s;on had a reprimand, for giving him the Oaths, when the day was pa&s;t.</P>
<P>This was kept up from the King; And the Earl of <HI>Brai|dalbin</HI> came to Court, to give an account of his diligence, and to bring back the money, &s;ince he could not do the &s;ervice, for which he had it. He informed again&s;t this <HI>Macdonald,</HI> as the chief per&s;on, who had defeated that good de&s;ign; And that he might both gratify his own revenge, and render the King odious to all the Highlanders, he propo&s;ed, that Orders &s;hould be &s;ent for a military execution, on tho&s;e of <HI>Glencoe.</HI> An In|&s;truction was drawn by the Secretary of State, to be both &s;igned and counter&s;igned by the King (that &s;o he might bear no part of the blame, but that it might lie wholly on the King) that &s;uch as had not taken the Oaths, by the time limited, &s;hould be &s;hut out of the benefit of the Indemnity, and be received only upon mercy. But when it was found, that this would not au|thorize what was intended, a &s;econd Order was got to be &s;igned and counter&s;igned, that if the <HI>Glencoe</HI> men could be &s;eparated, from the re&s;t of the Highlanders, &s;ome Examples might be made of them, in order to &s;trike terror into the re&s;t. The King &s;igned this, without any enquiry about it; for he was too apt to &s;ign papers in a hurry, without examining the importance of them. This was one effect of his &s;lowne&s;s in di&s;patching bu&s;i|ne&s;s: for as he was apt to &s;uffer things to run on, till there was a great heap of papers laid before him; &s;o then he &s;igned them, a little too precipitately. But all this while, the King knew nothing of <HI>Macdonald</HI>'s offering to take the Oaths, within the time, nor of his having taken them &s;oon after it was pa&s;t, when he came to a proper Magi&s;trate. As the&s;e Orders were &s;ent down, the Secretary of State writ many private Letters to <HI>Leving|&s;toun,</HI> who commanded in <HI>Scotland,</HI> giving him a &s;trict charge and particular directions for the execution of them: And he ordered the pa&s;&s;es in the Valley to be kept, de&s;cribing them &s;o minutely, that the Orders were certainly drawn by one, who knew the Country well. He gave al&s;o a po&s;itive direction, that no Pri&s;oners &s;hould be taken, that &s;o the execution might be as
<PB N="90" REF="111">
terrible as was po&s;&s;ible. He pre&s;&s;ed this upon <HI>Leving &s;toun,</HI> with &s;trains of vehemence, that looked as if there was &s;omething more than ordinary in it; He indeed grounded it on his zeal for the King's &s;ervice, adding, that &s;uch Rebels and Murderers &s;hould be made Examples of.</P>
<P>In <HI>February,</HI> a Company was &s;ent to <HI>Glencoe,</HI> who were kindly received, and quartered over the Valley; the Inhabitants think|ing them&s;elves &s;afe, and looking for no Ho&s;tilities; After they had &s;taid a week among them, they took their time in the night, and killed about &s;ix and thirty of them, the re&s;t taking the alarm, and e&s;caping: This rai&s;ed a mighty out-cry, and was publi&s;hed by the <HI>French</HI> in their Gazettes, and by the Jacobites in their Libels, to ca&s;t a reproach on the King's Government, as cruel and barbarous; tho' in all other in&s;tances it had ap|peared, that his own inclinations were gentle and mild, rather to an exce&s;s. The King &s;ent Orders to inquire into the matter; But when the Letters, writ upon this bu&s;ine&s;s, were all examined, which I my&s;elf read, it appeared, that &s;o many were involved in the matter, that the King's gentlene&s;s prevailed on him to a fault; and he contented him&s;elf with di&s;mi&s;&s;ing only the Ma&s;ter of <HI>Stair</HI> from his Service: The Highlanders were &s;o inflamed with this, that they were put in as forward a di&s;po&s;ition, as the Jaco|bites wi&s;hed for, to have rebelled upon the fir&s;t favourable op|portunity: And indeed the not puni&s;hing this with a due rigour, was the greate&s;t blot in this whole Reign, and had a very ill effect in alienating that Nation, from the King and his Govern|ment.</P>
<P>An Incident happened near the end of this Se&s;&s;ion, that had <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earl of <HI>Marlboro'</HI> di&s;graced.</NOTE> very ill effects; which I unwillingly mention, becau&s;e it cannot be told without &s;ome reflections on the memory of the Queen, whom I always honoured, beyond all the per&s;ons I had ever known. The Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI> came to the Earl of <HI>Marl|borough,</HI> with a me&s;&s;age from the King, telling him, that he had no more u&s;e for his Service, and therefore he demanded all his Commi&s;&s;ions. What drew &s;o &s;udden and &s;o hard a me&s;&s;age was not known: For he had been with the King that morning, and had parted with him in the ordinary manner. It &s;eemed, &s;ome Letter was intercepted, which gave &s;u&s;picion: It is certain, that he thought he was too little con&s;idered, and that he had, upon many occa&s;ions, cen&s;ured the King's conduct, and reflected on the <HI>Dutch.</HI> But the original cau&s;e of his di&s;grace, aro&s;e from another con&s;ideration; The Prince&s;s thought her&s;elf too much neglected by the King, who&s;e cold way towards her, was &s;oon ob&s;erved: After the King was on the Throne, no propo&s;itions
<PB N="91" REF="112">
were made to her of a Settlement, nor any advances of money. So &s;he, thinking &s;he was to be kept in a nece&s;&s;itous dependance on the Court, got &s;ome to move in the Hou&s;e of Commons, in the year 1690, when they were in the Debate concerning the Revenue, that &s;he &s;hould have a&s;&s;ignments, &s;uitable to her Dignity. This both King and Queen took ami&s;s from her; The Queen complained more particularly, that &s;he was then ill, after her lying-in of the Duke of <HI>Gloce&s;ter</HI> at <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> and that &s;he her&s;elf was treat|ing her and the young child, with the tenderne&s;s of a mother, and that yet &s;uch a motion was made, before &s;he had tried, in a private way, what the King intended to a&s;&s;ign her. The Prin|ce&s;s, on the other hand, &s;aid, &s;he knew the Queen was a good wife, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and obedient to every thing that the King de|&s;ired; &s;o &s;he thought, the be&s;t way was to have a Settlement by Act of Parliament: On the other hand, the cu&s;tom had al|ways been, that the Royal Family (a Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> not ex|cepted) was kept in a dependance on the King, and had no al|lowance, but from his meer favour and kindne&s;s; yet in this ca&s;e, in which the Prince&s;s was put out of the Succe&s;&s;ion, during the King's life, it &s;eemed rea&s;onable, that &s;omewhat more than ordinary &s;hould be done in con&s;ideration of that. The Act pa&s;t, allowing her a Settlement of fifty thou&s;and pounds. But upon this a coldne&s;s followed, between not only the King, but even the Queen, and the Prince&s;s. And the blame of this mo|tion was ca&s;t on the Counte&s;s of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> as mo&s;t in favour with the Prince&s;s: And this had contributed much to alienate the King from her husband, and had di&s;po&s;ed him to receive ill impre&s;&s;ions of him.</P>
<P>Upon his di&s;grace, his Lady was forbid the Court; The <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Breach between the Queen and the Prince&s;s.</NOTE> Prince&s;s would not &s;ubmit to this; She thought, &s;he ought to be allowed to keep what per&s;ons &s;he plea&s;ed about her&s;elf. And when the Queen in&s;i&s;ted on the thing, &s;he retired from the Court. There were, no doubt, ill offices done on all hands, as there were &s;ome that pre&s;&s;ed the Prince&s;s to &s;ubmit to the Queen, as well as others who pre&s;&s;ed the Queen to pa&s;s it over; but without effect: Both had engaged them&s;elves, before they had well reflected on the con&s;equences of &s;uch a breach: And the matter went &s;o far, that the Queen ordered, that no publick Honours &s;hould be &s;hewed the Prince&s;s, be&s;ides many other le&s;&s;er matters, which I unwillingly reflect on, becau&s;e I was much troubled to &s;ee the Queen carry &s;uch a matter &s;o far: And the breach continued to the end of her life. The Enemies of the Government tried what could be made of this, to create di&s;tractions among us; But the Prince&s;s gave no encouragement
<PB N="92" REF="113">
to them. So that this mi&s;under&s;tanding had no other effect, but that it gave Enemies much ill-natured joy, and a &s;ecret &s;piteful diver&s;ion.</P>
<P>The King gave <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> the Command of the Fleet; tho' he had put him&s;elf in ill terms with him, by pre&s;&s;ing to know the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> com|manded the Fleet.</NOTE> grounds of the Earl of <HI>Marlborough</HI>'s di&s;grace: He had not only lived in great friend&s;hip with him, but had carried the fir&s;t me&s;&s;ages that had pa&s;&s;ed between him and the King, when he went over to <HI>Holland;</HI> He almo&s;t upbraided the King with the Earl of <HI>Marlborough</HI>'s Services, who, as he &s;aid, had &s;et the Crown on his head. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> al&s;o came to be in ill terms with the Earl of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> who as he thought, &s;upported a faction among the Flag Officers again&s;t him; And he fell indeed into &s;o ill an humour, on many accounts, that he &s;eemed to be for &s;ome time in doubt, whether he ought to undertake the com|mand of the Fleet, or not: I tried, at the de&s;ire of &s;ome of his friends, to &s;often him a little, but without &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The King went over to <HI>Holland</HI> in <HI>March,</HI> to prepare for <NOTE PLACE="marg">A De&s;cent in $word$ $word$ by K. <HI>James.</HI></NOTE> an early Campaign. He intimated &s;omewhat in his Speech to the Parliament, of a de&s;cent de&s;igned upon <HI>France;</HI> But we had neither men nor money to execute it. And, while we were plea&s;ing our &s;elves with the thoughts of a de&s;cent in <HI>France,</HI> King <HI>James</HI> was preparing for a real one in <HI>England.</HI> It was intended to be made in the end of <HI>April:</HI> He had about him fourteen thou&s;and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Iri&s;h;</HI> And Mar&s;hal <HI>Belfonds</HI> was to accompany him, with about three thou&s;and <HI>French.</HI> They were to fail from <HI>Cherbourg</HI> and <HI>La Hogue,</HI> and &s;ome other places in <HI>Normandy,</HI> and to land in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> and from thence to march with all ha&s;te to <HI>London.</HI> A Tran&s;port-Fleet was al&s;o brought thither: They were to bring over only a &s;mall number of hor&s;es; for their party, in <HI>England,</HI> undertook to furni&s;h them with hor&s;es, at their landing. At the &s;ame time, the King of <HI>France</HI> was $word$ march with a great Army into <HI>Flanders;</HI> and he reckoned, that the de&s;cent in <HI>England,</HI> would either have &s;ucceeded, &s;ince there $word$ very &s;mall force left within the Kingdom; or at lea&s;t, that $word$ would have obliged the King to come over, with &s;ome of his <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Troops: And in that ca&s;e, which way &s;oever the War of <HI>England</HI> had ended, he &s;hould have ma&s;tered <HI>Flanders,</HI> and $word$ forced the <HI>States</HI> to &s;ubmit: And, in ca&s;e other de&s;igns had failed, there was one in re&s;erve, managed by the <HI>French</HI> Mini&s;try, and by <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating the King, which would have brought about all their de&s;igns. The <HI>French</HI> King &s;eemed to think the Project was &s;o well laid, that it could not mi&s;carry: for he &s;aid publickly, before he &s;et out, that he was going to
<PB N="93" REF="114">
make an end of the War. We in <HI>England</HI> were all this while very &s;ecure, and did not apprehend we were in any danger. Both the King and his Secretaries were much blamed, for taking &s;o little care to procure Intelligence; If the winds had favoured the <HI>French,</HI> they them&s;elves would have brought us the fir&s;t news of their de&s;ign; They &s;ent over &s;ome per&s;ons, to give their friends notice, but a very few days, before they reckoned, they &s;hould be on our Coa&s;t: One of the&s;e was a <HI>Scotchman,</HI> and brought the fir&s;t di&s;covery to <HI>John&s;toun:</HI> Orders were pre&s;ently &s;ent out, to bring together &s;uch Forces as lay &s;cattered in Quar|ters; And a Squadron of our Fleet, that was &s;et to Sea, was ordered to lay on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Normandy:</HI> But the Heavens &s;ought again&s;t them more effectually, than we could have done. There was, for a whole month together, &s;uch a Storm that lay on their Coa&s;t, that it was not po&s;&s;ible for them to come out of their Ports; nor could Mar&s;hal <HI>D'E&s;trees</HI> come about with the Squadron from <HI>Toulon,</HI> &s;o &s;oon as was expected. In the beginning of <HI>May,</HI> about forty of our Ships were on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Normandy,</HI> and were endeavouring to de&s;troy their Tran&s;port Ships: Upon which, Orders were &s;ent to Mar&s;hal <HI>Tourville,</HI> to &s;ail to the Channel, and fight the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet. They had a We&s;terly wind to bring them within the Channel: But then the wind &s;truck into the Ea&s;t, and &s;tood &s;o long there, that it both brought over the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet, and brought about our great Ships. By this means, our whole Fleet was joined: So that <HI>Tourville</HI>'s de&s;ign, of getting between the &s;everal Squadrons that compo&s;ed it, was lo&s;t. The King of <HI>France,</HI> being then in <HI>Flanders,</HI> upon this change of wind, &s;ent Orders to <HI>Tourville</HI> not to fight: Yet the Ve&s;&s;el that carried the&s;e was taken, and the duplicate of the&s;e Orders, that was &s;ent by another conveyance, came not to him till the day after the Engagement.</P>
<P>On the nineteenth of <HI>May, Ru&s;&s;el</HI> came up with the <HI>French,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">A great Vic|tory at Sea.</NOTE> and was almo&s;t twice their number; Yet not above the half of his Ships could be brought into the Action, by rea&s;on of the winds: <HI>Rook,</HI> one of his Admirals, was thought more in fault. The number of the Ships that engaged was almo&s;t equal; Our men &s;aid, that the <HI>French</HI> neither &s;hewed courage nor skill in the Action; The night and a fog &s;eparated the two Fleets, after an Engagement that had la&s;ted &s;ome hours. The greate&s;t part of the <HI>French</HI> Ships drew near their Coa&s;ts; But <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> not ca&s;ting anchor, as the <HI>French</HI> did, was carried out by the tide: So next morning he was at &s;ome di&s;tance from them. A great part of the <HI>French</HI> Fleet &s;ailed We&s;tward, through a dangerous Sea, called the Race of <HI>Alderney: A&s;hby</HI> was &s;ent to pur&s;ue

But <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> was provoked by &s;ome Letters and Orders, that the Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI> &s;ent him from the Queen, which he thought were the effects of ignorance; And upon that he fell into a cro&s;&s;ne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition; He found fault with every Order that was &s;ent him; But would offer no advices on his part. And he came &s;oon after to St. <HI>Helens;</HI> which was much cen&s;ured; for tho' the di&s;abled Ships mu&s;t have been &s;ent in, yet there was no &s;uch rea&s;on for bringing in the re&s;t, that were not touched. Cro&s;s winds kept them long in Port; So that a great part of the Summer was &s;pent, before he went out again. The <HI>French</HI> had recovered out of the fir&s;t di&s;order, that had quite di&s;pirited them. A de&s;cent in <HI>France</HI> came to be thought on, when it was too late: About &s;even thou&s;and men were &s;hipped; And it was intended to land them at St. <HI>Malo</HI>'s; But the Seamen were of opinion, that neither there, nor any where el&s;e, a de|&s;cent was then practicable. They complained, that the Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI> was ignorant of Sea affairs, and yet that he &s;et on propo&s;itions relating to them, without con&s;ulting Seamen, and &s;ent Orders which could not be obeyed, without endangering the whole Fleet. So the men, who were thus &s;hipped, lay &s;ome days on board, to the great reproach of our Coun&s;els: But that we might not appear too ridiculous, both at home and abroad, by landing them again in <HI>England;</HI> the King ordered them to be &s;ent over to <HI>Flanders,</HI> after they had been for &s;ome weeks on Shipboard; And &s;o our Campaign on the Sea, that began &s;o gloriou&s;ly, had a poor conclu&s;ion. The common reflection that was made on our conduct was, that the providence of God, and the valour of our men, had given us a victory, of which we knew not what u&s;e we &s;hould make: And which was wor&s;e, our Merchants complained of great lo&s;&s;es this Summer; for the <HI>French</HI> having laid up their Fleet, let their Seamen go and &s;erve in Privateers, with which they watched all the motions of our Trade: And &s;o, by an odd Rever&s;e of things, as we made no

con&s;iderable lo&s;&s;es, while the <HI>French</HI> were Ma&s;ters of our Sea, two years before; &s;o now, when we triumphed on that Ele|ment, our Merchants &s;uffered the mo&s;t. The conclu&s;ion of all was, <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> complained of the Mini&s;try, particularly of the Earl of <HI>Nottingham;</HI> and they complained no le&s;s of him; and the Merchants complained of the Admiralty: But they, in their own defence &s;aid, that we had not Ships nor Seamen, both to fur|ni&s;h out a great Fleet, and at the &s;ame time to &s;end out Con|voys for &s;ecuring the Trade.</P>
<P>In <HI>Flanders,</HI> the de&s;ign, to which the <HI>French</HI> tru&s;ted mo&s;t, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A De&s;ign to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the King.</NOTE> failed: That was laid for a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating the King: One <HI>Grand|val</HI> had been in treaty with <HI>Louvoy</HI> about it; And it was in|tended to be executed the former year. He joined with <HI>Du Mont</HI> to follow the King and &s;hoot him, as he was riding about in his ordinary way, moving &s;lowly, and vi&s;iting the po&s;ts of his Army. The King of <HI>France</HI> had lo&s;t two Mini&s;ters, one after another. <HI>Seignelay</HI> died fir&s;t, who had no extraordinary genius, but he knew all his father's methods, and pur&s;ued them &s;o, that he governed him&s;elf, both by his father's maxims, and with his tools. <HI>Louvoy</HI> did not &s;urvive him long; He had more fire, and &s;o grew unea&s;y at the authority, Madam de <HI>Maintenon</HI> took in things which &s;he could not under&s;tand: And was, in conclu&s;ion, &s;o unacceptable to the King, that once, when he flung his bundle of papers down upon the floor before him, upon &s;ome provocation, the King lifted up his cane: But the Lady held him from doing more; Yet that affront, as was given out, &s;unk &s;o deep into <HI>Louvoy</HI>'s &s;pirits, that he died &s;ud|denly a few days after. Some &s;aid, it was of an Apoplexy; Others &s;u&s;pected poi&s;on; for a man that knew &s;o many &s;ecrets, would have been dangerous, if he had out-lived his favour. His Son <HI>Barbe&s;ieux</HI> had the &s;urvivance of his place, and con|tinued in it for &s;ome years; But, as he was young, &s;o he had not a capacity equal to the po&s;t. He found, among his father's papers, a memorandum of this de&s;ign of <HI>Grandval</HI>'s; So he &s;ent for him, and re&s;olved to pur&s;ue it; in which Madam <HI>de Maintenon</HI> concurred, and <HI>Luxemburgh</HI> was tru&s;ted with the direction of it. <HI>Du Mont</HI> retired this winter to <HI>Zell,</HI> as one that had for&s;aken the <HI>French</HI> Service: From &s;ome practices and di&s;cour&s;es of his, a &s;u&s;picion aro&s;e, of which Sir <HI>William Colt,</HI> the King's Envoy there, gave notice: So one <HI>Leefdale,</HI> a <HI>Dutch</HI> Papi&s;t, was &s;ecretly &s;ent to <HI>Paris,</HI> as a per&s;on that would enter into the de&s;ign; But, in reality, went on purpo&s;e to di&s;cover it.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="117">
<HI>Grandval</HI> and he came back to <HI>Flanders,</HI> to &s;et about it; But <HI>Leefdale</HI> brought him into a party, that &s;eized on him: Both King <HI>James,</HI> and his Queen, were, as <HI>Grandval</HI> &s;aid, engaged <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Grandval</HI> &s;uffered for it, and con|fe&s;&s;es it.</NOTE> in the de&s;ign; One <HI>Parkher,</HI> whom they employed in many black de&s;igns, had concerted the matter with <HI>Grandval,</HI> as he confe&s;&s;ed, and had carried him to King <HI>James,</HI> who encou|raged him to go on with it, and promi&s;ed great rewards. When <HI>Grandval</HI> &s;aw there was full proof again&s;t him, he confe&s;&s;ed the whole &s;eries of the management, without &s;taying till he were put to the torture. Mr. <HI>Morel</HI> of <HI>Berne,</HI> a famous Medali&s;t, (who had, for &s;ome years, the charge of the <HI>French</HI> King's ca|binet of medals, but being a Prote&s;tant, and refu&s;ing to change his Religion, was kept a clo&s;e pri&s;oner in the <HI>Ba&s;tile</HI> for &s;even years) was let out in <HI>April</HI> this year. And, before he left <HI>Paris,</HI> his curio&s;ity carried him to St <HI>Germains,</HI> to &s;ee King <HI>James:</HI> He happened both to go and come back in the Coach with <HI>Grandval;</HI> And while he was there, he &s;aw him in private di&s;cour&s;e with King <HI>James: Grandval</HI> was full of this project, and, according to the <HI>French</HI> way, he talked very loo&s;ely to <HI>Morel,</HI> not knowing who he was; but fancied he was well af|fected to that Court. He &s;aid there was a de&s;ign in hand, that would confound all <HI>Europe:</HI> For the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> &s;o he called the King, would not live a month. This <HI>Morel</HI> writ over to me in too carele&s;s a manner; for he directed his Letter with his own hand, which was well known at Court; Yet it came &s;afe to me. The King gave Orders, that none belonging to him &s;hould go near <HI>Grandval,</HI> that there might be no colour for &s;aying, that the hopes of life had drawn his Confe&s;&s;ion from him; Nor was he &s;trictly interrogated concerning Circum&s;tances; but was left to tell his &s;tory, as he plea&s;ed him&s;elf. He was condemned; and &s;uffered with &s;ome &s;light remor&s;e, for going into a de&s;ign to kill a King: His Confe&s;&s;ion was printed. But how black &s;oever it repre&s;ented the Court of <HI>France,</HI> no notice was taken of it: Nor did any of that Court offer to di&s;own or di&s;prove it, but let it pa&s;s and be forgotten: Yet &s;o blind and violent was their party among us, that they re&s;olved they would believe nothing, that either blemi&s;hed King <HI>James,</HI> or the <HI>French</HI> Court.</P>
<P>But tho' this mi&s;carried, the <HI>French</HI> &s;ucceeded in the Siege <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Namur</HI> was taken by the <HI>French.</HI></NOTE> of <HI>Namur:</HI> A place of great importance, that commanded both the <HI>Mae&s;e</HI> and <HI>Sambre,</HI> and covered both <HI>Liege</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;tricht:</HI> The Town did &s;oon capitulate, but the Citadel held out much longer. The King came with a great Army to rai&s;e the Siege; <HI>Luxemburgh</HI> lay in his way with another to cover it, and the
<PB N="97" REF="118">
<HI>Mehaigne</HI> lay between. The King intended to pa&s;s the River, and force a Battle; But &s;uch rains fell, the night before he de|&s;igned to do it, and the River &s;welled &s;o much, that he could not pa&s;s it for &s;ome days: He tried, by another motion, to come and rai&s;e the Siege. But the Town having capitulated &s;o early, and the Citadel laying on the other &s;ide of the <HI>Sambre,</HI> he could not come at it: So after a month's Siege it was taken. This was looked on as the greate&s;t action of the <HI>French</HI> King's life; that, notwith&s;tanding the depre&s;&s;ion of &s;uch a defeat at Sea, he yet &s;upported his mea&s;ures, &s;o as to take that important place, in the view of a great Army. The King's conduct was on this occa&s;ion much cen&s;ured: It was &s;aid, he ought to have put much to hazard, rather than &s;uffer &s;uch a place to be taken in his &s;ight.</P>
<P>After <HI>Namur</HI> &s;urrendred, that King went back to <HI>Paris</HI> in his u&s;ual method; for, according to the old <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Luxury, he u&s;ed to bring the Ladies with him, with the Mu&s;ick, Poems, and Scenes, for an Opera, and a Ball; in which he and his actions were to be &s;et out, with the pomp of much flattery. When this action was over, his Forces lay on the Defen&s;ive, and both Armies made &s;ome motions, watching and waiting on one another.</P>
<P>At <HI>Steenkirk,</HI> the King thought he had a favourable occa&s;ion <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Battle of <HI>Steen|kirk.</HI></NOTE> for attacking the <HI>French,</HI> in their Camp; But the ground was found to be narrower, and le&s;s practicable, than the King had been made to believe it was. Ten Battalions begun the Attack, and carried a Po&s;t with Cannon, and maintained it long, doing great execution on the Enemy; And if they had been &s;upported, or brought off, it had proved a brave attempt: But they were cut in pieces. In the whole action, the <HI>French</HI> lo&s;t many more men than the Confederates did; for they came &s;o thick, that our fire made great execution. The conduct of this affair was much cen&s;ured. It was &s;aid, the ground ought to have been better examined, before the attack was begun; And the men ought to have been better maintained, than they were: For many thought, that if this had been done, we might have had a total Victory. Count <HI>Solms</HI> bore the blame of the errors, com|mitted on this occa&s;ion. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had been &s;ometimes check'd by him, as he was much di&s;gu&s;ted with their heat and pride: So they charged all on him, who had &s;ome good qualities; but did not manage them in an obliging manner. We lo&s;t in this action about five thou&s;and men, and many brave Officers; Here <HI>Mackay</HI> was killed, being ordered to a Po&s;t that he &s;aw could not be maintained; He &s;ent his opinion about
<PB N="98" REF="119">
it; But the former Orders were confirmed: So he went on, &s;aying only, The Will of the Lord be done. He was a man of &s;uch &s;trict principles, that he would not have &s;erved in a War that he did not think lawful. He took great care of his Soldiers morals, and forced them to be both &s;ober and ju&s;t in their Quarters: He &s;pent all the time that he was ma&s;ter of, in &s;ecret Prayers, and in the reading of the Scriptures. The King often ob&s;erved, that when he had full lei&s;ure for his devotions, he acted with a peculiar exaltation of courage. He had one very &s;ingular quality; In Councils of War, he delivered his opi|nion freely, and maintained it with due zeal; But how po&s;itive &s;oever he was in it, if the Council of War over-ruled it, even tho' he he was not convinced by it, yet to all others he ju&s;tified it, and executed his part with the &s;ame zeal, as if his own opinion had prevailed After the Action at <HI>Steenkirk,</HI> there was little done this Campaign. A Detachment, that the King &s;ent from his Army, joined with tho&s;e Bodies that came from <HI>England,</HI> broke in &s;ome way in to the <HI>French</HI> Conque&s;ts: They fortified <HI>Dixmuyde</HI> and <HI>Furnes,</HI> and put the Country about them under Contribution, and became very unea&s;y neighbours to <HI>Dun|kirk.</HI> The Command of tho&s;e Places was given to the Count of <HI>Horn,</HI> who under&s;tood well the way to make all po&s;&s;ible ad|vantages by Contributions; But he was a man of no great worth, and of as little courage. This di&s;gu&s;ted the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;till more; who &s;aid, the <HI>Dutch</HI> were always tru&s;ted and preferred, while they were neglected. They had &s;ome colour to cen&s;ure this choice the following winter: For, upon the motion of &s;ome <HI>French</HI> Troops, <HI>Horn</HI> (without &s;tudying to amu&s;e the Enemy, or to gain time, upon which, much may depend in Winter) did immediately abandon <HI>Dixmuyde.</HI> All he had to ju&s;tify him&s;elf, was a Letter from the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> telling him, that he could &s;end him no relief; and therefore he ordered him to take care of the Garri&s;on, which was of more importance than the Place it&s;elf. Thus the Campaign ended in <HI>Flanders; Na|mur</HI> was lo&s;t; The Reputation of the King's conducting Ar|mies was much &s;unk, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were generally di&s;con|tented, and alienated from the <HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>Nothing was done on the <HI>Rhine.</HI> The Elector of <HI>Saxony</HI> had <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in <HI>$word$.</HI></NOTE> promi&s;ed to bring an Army thither: But <HI>Shening</HI> his General, who had great power over him, was gained by the <HI>French,</HI> to break his de&s;ign. The Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> complained, that the Emperor favoured the Circles of <HI>Franconia</HI> and <HI>Swabia</HI> &s;o much, that he could have no good Quarters a&s;&s;igned him for his Army: And upon this occa&s;ion it was &s;aid, that the Emperor drew much
<PB N="99" REF="120">
money from tho&s;e Circles, that they might be covered from Winter Quarters; and that he applied all that to carrying on the War in <HI>Hungary;</HI> and &s;o left the weight of the War with <HI>France,</HI> to lie very heavy on the Princes of the Empire. This conte&s;t went on &s;o high, that <HI>Shening,</HI> who was thought the ill in&s;trument in it, going for his health to the Hot Baths in <HI>Bohemia,</HI> was &s;eized on by the Emperor's Orders; Upon which, great ex|po&s;tulations pa&s;&s;ed between the Courts of <HI>Vienna</HI> and <HI>Dre&s;den.</HI> There were two &s;mall Armies that acted &s;eparately on the <HI>Rhine,</HI> under the Command of the Landgrave of <HI>He&s;&s;e,</HI> and the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Bareith:</HI> But they were not able to cover the Empire: And another &s;mall Army, brought together by the Duke of <HI>Wirtemberg,</HI> for the defence of his Country, was to|tally defeated; Not only Cannon and Baggage, but the Duke him&s;elf fell into the Enemies hands.</P>
<P>But, tho' the Emperor did, as it were, abandon the Empire <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in <HI>Hungary.</HI></NOTE> to the <HI>French,</HI> he made no great progre&s;s in <HI>Hungary:</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> lay upon a defen&s;ive; And the Sea&s;on was &s;pent in mo|tions, without either Battle or Siege. There was &s;till &s;ome di&s;|cour&s;e, but no great probability of Peace. Two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Am|ba&s;&s;adors dying, the one, Sir <HI>Thomas Hu&s;&s;ay,</HI> &s;oon after his ar|rival at <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> and the other, Mr. <HI>Harbord,</HI> on his way thither; The Lord <HI>Paget,</HI> then our Amba&s;&s;ador at the Emperor's Court, was ordered to go thither, to mediate the Peace. He found the Mediation was, in a great mea&s;ure, &s;po$$ed by the <HI>Dutch</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, before his arrival: for he had been pre|vailed on, by the Court of <HI>Vienna,</HI> to offer the Mediation of the <HI>Dutch</HI> upon a very high Scheme. <HI>Caminieck,</HI> and the <HI>Ukrain,</HI> and <HI>Podolia,</HI> with <HI>Moldavia,</HI> and <HI>Valachia,</HI> were demanded for <HI>Poland: Tran&s;ilvania,</HI> with the per&s;on of Count <HI>Tekeli,</HI> for the Emperor; and <HI>Achaia</HI> and <HI>Livadia,</HI> as an Antemurale to cover the <HI>Morea,</HI> for the <HI>Venetians.</HI> The Court of <HI>Vienna,</HI> by offering &s;uch a Project, reckoned the War mu&s;t go on, which they de|&s;ired. The Mini&s;ters of the Port, who were gained by the <HI>French</HI> to carry on the War, were glad to &s;ee &s;o high a Project; They were afraid of Tumults; So they &s;pread this Project over the whole Empire, to &s;hew, on what ignominious terms the Mediation was propo&s;ed; And by that they they ju&s;tified their going on with the War. But the Lord <HI>P$ge$</HI> offered the King's Mediation upon another Project; which was, that every Prince was to keep what he was then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of: And <HI>Camini$span$k</HI> was only demanded to be razed. If this had been offered a$ fir&s;t, the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Court dur&s;t not have refu&s;ed it: The people were become &s;o weary under a long and unpro&s;p$span$ War;
<PB N="100" REF="121">
But the <HI>Vizier</HI> &s;uppre&s;&s;ed this, and made it &s;till pa&s;s among them, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> pre&s;&s;ed the &s;ame Project, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> had propo&s;ed; which was the more ea&s;ily believed there, be|cau&s;e how ignorant &s;oever they were at that Court, they knew well what an intere&s;t the King of <HI>England</HI> had in the <HI>States.</HI> So the War was &s;till carried on there; And <HI>Trumbal,</HI> who came over to <HI>England</HI> at this time, told the King, that if in&s;tead of &s;ending Emba&s;&s;ies, he would &s;end a powerful Fleet into the Mediterranean, to de&s;troy the <HI>French</HI> Trade, and &s;top the Com|merce with <HI>Turkey,</HI> he would quickly bring that Court to other mea&s;ures, or rai&s;e &s;uch tumults among them, as would &s;et that Empire, and even <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> it&s;elf, all in a flame.</P>
<P>In <HI>Piedmont,</HI> the Campaign was opened very late; And the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in <HI>Pie$mont.</HI></NOTE> <HI>French</HI> were on a defen&s;ive: So the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> entred into <HI>Dauphiny</HI> with an Army; And if he had carried on that at|tempt with the Spirit, with which he began it, he had put the affairs of <HI>France</HI> on that &s;ide into great di&s;order: But he was either ill &s;erved, or betrayed in it; He &s;at down before <HI>Ambrun,</HI> and be&s;ieged it in form: So that a place, which he might have carried in three days, co&s;t him &s;ome weeks: And in every &s;tep, he made it appear, there was either a great feeblene&s;s, or much treachery in his Coun&s;els. He made no great progre&s;s; Yet the di&s;order, it threw that and the neighbouring Provinces into, was very great. He was &s;topped by the Small Pox, which &s;aved his honour, as much as it endangered his per&s;on: The retreat of his Army, when his life was in danger, looked like a due caution. He recovered of the Small Pox, but a ferment remained &s;till in his Blood, and broke out &s;o often into feveri&s;h relap&s;es, that it was generally thought he was poi&s;oned. Many months pa&s;&s;ed, before he was out of danger. So the Campaign ended there with con&s;iderable lo&s;&s;es to the <HI>French,</HI> but with no great advantage to the Duke. The greate&s;t prejudice the <HI>French</HI> &s;uffered this year, was from the Sea&s;on; They had a very bad harve&s;t, and no vintage in the Northern parts. We in <HI>England</HI> had great apprehen&s;ions of as bad an one, from a very cold and wet Summer. Great deluges of rain continued till the very time of harve&s;t. But, when we were threatned with a famine, it plea&s;ed God to &s;end &s;uch an extraordinary change of the Sea|&s;on, that we had a very plentiful crop, enough both to &s;erve our &s;elves, and to &s;upply our neighbours, which made us ea&s;y at h$span$e, and brought in much wealth, for that Corn which we were ab$$ to &s;pare.</P>
<P>In the beginning of <HI>September,</HI> there was an Earthquake felt <NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ $word$ <HI>$word$.</HI></NOTE> in mo&s;t places in <HI>England;</HI> and was at the &s;ame time felt in
<PB N="101" REF="122">
many parts of <HI>France, Germany,</HI> and the <HI>Netherlands.</HI> No harm was done by it, tho' it continued for three or four minutes. I can write nothing of it from my own Ob&s;ervation; for it was not &s;en&s;ible in the place where I happened to be at that time; Nor can it be determined, whether this had any relation to tho&s;e terrible Earthquakes that happened, &s;ome months after this, in <HI>Sicily</HI> and <HI>Malta:</HI> Upon which I cannot enlarge, hav|ing &s;een no other account of them, than what was in publick Gazettes, which repre&s;ented them as the dreadfulle&s;t by much, of any that are in Hi&s;tory: It was e&s;timated, that about one hundred thou&s;and per&s;ons peri&s;hed by them in <HI>Sicily.</HI> It is &s;carce to be imagined, that the Earthquake, which about the &s;ame time de&s;troyed the be&s;t part of the chief Town in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> could have any connection with the&s;e in <HI>Europe.</HI> The&s;e were very extraordinary things, which made tho&s;e, who &s;tudied Apo|calyptical matters, imagine that the end of the World drew near. It had been happy for us, if &s;uch di&s;mal accidents had &s;truck us with a deeper &s;en&s;e of the Judgments of God.</P>
<P>We were indeed brought to more of an outward face of <NOTE PLACE="marg">A great Corrup$$$n over <HI>Eng|lan$.</HI></NOTE> vertue and &s;obriety: And the great examples, that the King and Queen &s;et the Nation, had made &s;ome con&s;iderable altera|tions, as to publick practices: But we became deeply corrupted in principle: A disbelief of Revealed Religion, and a profane mocking at the Chri&s;tian Faith, and the My&s;teries of it, became avowed and &s;candalous. The Queen, in the King's ab&s;ence, gave orders to execute the Laws again&s;t Drunkenne&s;s, Swearing, and the Profanation of the Lord's Day; and &s;ent directions over <HI>England,</HI> to all Magi&s;trates to do their duty in executing them; to which the King joined his Authority, upon his return to <HI>England.</HI> Yet the Reformation of Manners, which &s;ome zealous men &s;tudied to promote, went on but &s;lowly: Many of the inferior Magi&s;trates were not only remi&s;s, but very faulty them&s;elves: They did all they could to di&s;courage tho&s;e, who endeavoured to have Vice &s;uppre&s;&s;ed and puni&s;hed: And it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the behaviour of many Clergymen gave Athei&s;ts no &s;mall advantage: They had taken the Oaths, and read the Prayers for the pre&s;ent Government; They ob&s;erved the Orders for publick Fa&s;ts and Thank&s;givings; And yet they &s;hewed in many places their aver&s;ion to our E&s;tabli&s;hment but too vi&s;ibly: So that the offence that this gave, in many parts of the Nation, was too evident: In &s;ome places, it broke out in very indecent In&s;tances, that were brought into Courts of Law, and cen&s;ured. This made many conclude, that the Clergy were a &s;ort of men, that would &s;wear and pray, even again&s;t their

Con&s;ciences, rather than lo&s;e their Benefices; and by con&s;e|quence, that they were governed by Intere&s;t, and not by Prin|ciple. The Jacobites grew &s;till to be more and more outrageous, while the Clergy &s;eemed to be Neutrals in the di&s;pute; And which was yet the mo&s;t extraordinary thing in the whole mat|ter, the Government it&s;elf acted with &s;o much remi&s;&s;ne&s;s, and &s;o few were enquired after, or puni&s;hed, that tho&s;e who were employed by the King, behaved them&s;elves, in many places, as if they had &s;ecret In&s;tructions to be heavy upon his be&s;t friends, and to be gentle to his Enemies. Upon the whole matter, the Nation was falling under &s;uch a general corruption, both as to Morals and Principles; And that was &s;o much &s;pread among all &s;orts of people, that it gave us great apprehen&s;ions of heavy Judgments from Heaven.</P>
<P>The Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament was opened under great di&s;advan|tages. <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament.</NOTE> The Earl of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> and &s;ome other Peers, had been put in the Tower, upon a fal&s;e accu&s;ation of High Trea&s;on, which was evidently proved to be a Con&s;piracy, de&s;igned by &s;ome profligate creatures, who fancied that forgeries and fal&s;e &s;wearing would be as acceptable, and as well rewarded, in this Reign, as they had been formerly. But till this was detected, the per&s;ons accu&s;ed were kept in Pri&s;on; and were now only out upon Bail: So it was &s;aid to be contrary to the nature and freedom of Parliaments, for Pri&s;oners to &s;it in it. It was con|fe&s;&s;ed, that in times of danger, and &s;uch was the former Sum|mer, it mu&s;t be tru&s;ted to the di&s;cretion of a Government, to commit &s;uch per&s;ons as were &s;u&s;pected: But when the danger was over, by our Victory at Sea, tho&s;e again&s;t whom there lay nothing be&s;ides &s;u&s;picions, ought to have been &s;et at liberty: And this was thought rea&s;onable. There was an A&s;&s;ociation pretended to be drawn again&s;t the Government, to which the Sub&s;criptions of many Lords were &s;et &s;o dexterou&s;ly, that the Lords them&s;elves &s;aid, they could not di&s;tingui&s;h between their true Sub&s;criptions, and tho&s;e that were forged for them. But the manner of the di&s;covery, with &s;everal other circum&s;tances, carried &s;uch marks of Impo&s;ture, that the Lords of the Council ordered a &s;trict pro|&s;ecution of all concerned in it, which ended in a full conviction of the forgery: And tho&s;e who had combined in it, were whipt and pilloried, which, to the reproach of our Con&s;titution, is the only puni&s;hment that our Law has yet provided for &s;uch prac|tices. The Lords pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome Votes, a&s;&s;erting their Privileges; and were offended with the Judges, for detaining &s;ome in pri&s;on, tho' there was no rea&s;on nor colour for their di&s;plea&s;ure. But
<PB N="103" REF="124">
where the Privilege, or the Dignity of Peerage is in que&s;tion, it is not ea&s;y to keep the Hou&s;e within bounds.</P>
<P>The Debate went off in a Bill, that indemnified the Mini&s;try for tho&s;e Commitments, but limited them, for the future, by &s;everal rules; all which rules were rejected by the Commons. They thought tho&s;e Limitations gave a Legal power to commit, in ca&s;es where they were ob&s;erved; whereas they thought the fafer way was, to indemnify the Mini&s;try, when it was vi&s;ible they did not commit any but upon a real danger, and not to &s;et them any rules: Since, as to the committing of &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons, where the danger is real and vi&s;ible, the publick &s;afety mu&s;t be fir&s;t looked to, and &s;uper&s;ede all particular Laws. When this was over, an attempt was made in both Hou&s;es, for the Abjuration of King <HI>James:</HI> The King him&s;elf was more &s;et on it, than he had been formerly. It was rejected by the Hou&s;e of Commons: And tho' &s;ome &s;teps were made in it by the Lords, yet the oppo&s;ition was &s;o great, that it was let fall.</P>
<P>The affairs at Sea occa&s;ioned much heat in both Hou&s;es. The Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI> laid before the Lords, upon an Addre&s;s they had made to the King, all the Letters that had pa&s;t be|tween him&s;elf and <HI>Ru&s;&s;el;</HI> with all the Orders he had &s;ent him: And he aggravated <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI>'s errors and neglects very &s;e|verely. But the Hou&s;e of Commons ju&s;tified <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> and gave him thanks over and over again; and remained &s;o fixed in this, that tho' the Lords then communicated the papers, the Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI> had laid before them, to the Commons, they would not &s;o much as read them, but renewed their fir&s;t Votes, that ju&s;tified <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI>'s fidelity, courage, and conduct.</P>
<P>The King was now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed again&s;t him: For he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed <NOTE PLACE="marg">Jealou&s;ies of the $span$g's Mini&s;ters.</NOTE> him from his Service, and put the Command of the Fleet into the hands of three per&s;ons, <HI>Killigrew, Delaval,</HI> and <HI>Shovel:</HI> The two fir&s;t were thought &s;o inclinable to King <HI>James</HI>'s In|tere&s;ts, that it made &s;ome in&s;inuate, that the King was in the hands of tho&s;e, who intended to betray him to his Enemies: For tho' no exception lay again&s;t <HI>Shovel,</HI> yet it was &s;aid, he was only put with the other Two, to give &s;ome reputation to the Commi&s;&s;ion, and that he was One again&s;t Two; &s;o that he could neither hinder nor do any thing. The chief blame of this Nomination was thrown on the Earl of <HI>Nottingham;</HI> and of tho&s;e, who belonged to his Office, many &s;tories were rai&s;ed and &s;pread about, as if there had been among them, be&s;ides a very great remi&s;&s;ne&s;s in &s;ome of the concerns of the Government, an actual betraying of all our Secrets and Coun&s;els. The opi|nion of this was &s;pread both within and without the Kingdom;
<PB N="104" REF="125">
And mo&s;t of our Con&s;ederates were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with it. He ju&s;|tified not only him&s;elf, but all his Under Secretaries; Both King and Queen continued &s;till to have a good opinion of his fide|lity; But they &s;aw &s;ome defects in his Judgment, with a mo&s;t violent Party heat, that appeared upon all occa&s;ions, and even in the &s;malle&s;t matters. The Bills for the &s;upply went on with a heavy progre&s;s in the Hou&s;e of Commons; Tho&s;e who could not oppo&s;e them, yet &s;hewed their ill humour in delaying them, and clogging them with unacceptable clau&s;es all they could. And they continued that wa&s;teful method, of rai&s;ing money upon remote Funds; by which there lay a heavy di&s;count on Tallies; &s;o that above a fourth part was, in &s;ome of them, to be di&s;counted: The parties of Whig and Tory appeared almo&s;t in every debate, and in every que&s;tion.</P>
<P>The ill humour prevailed mo&s;t in the Hou&s;e of Lords, where <NOTE PLACE="marg">Complaints in Parlia|ment.</NOTE> a &s;trong oppo&s;ition was made to every thing that was propo&s;ed for the Government. They pa&s;t many Votes, and made many Addre&s;&s;es to the King, which were chiefly de&s;igned to load the Admini&s;tration, and to alienate the King from the <HI>Dutch.</HI> The Commons begun with great complaints of the Admiralty: And then they had the conduct in <HI>Flanders,</HI> par|ticularly in the Action at <HI>Steenkirk,</HI> before them: And they voted &s;ome heads of an Addre&s;s relating to tho&s;e matters: But by a &s;ecret management, they let the whole thing fall, after they had pa&s;&s;ed tho&s;e angry Votes. Any thing that the Lords could do, was of le&s;s moment, when it was not like to be &s;e|conded by the Commons; Yet they &s;hewed much ill humour.</P>
<P>This was chiefly managed by the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Halifax,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Mulgrave;</HI> And they drew in the Earl of <HI>Shrews|bury,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">169$</NOTE> who was very ill plea&s;ed with the credit, that &s;ome had with the King, and lived in a particular friend&s;hip with the Earl of <HI>Marlborough;</HI> and thought that he was both ungratefully and unju&s;tly per&s;ecuted. The&s;e Lords had all the Jacobites ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, in every thing that could embroil matters; A great many Whigs, who were di&s;contented, and jealous of the Mini&s;try, joined with them: They knew that all their mur|muring would &s;ignify little, unle&s;s they could &s;top a Money-bill: And, &s;ince it was &s;ettled in the Hou&s;e of Commons as a maxim, that the Lords could not make any alterations in Money-bills; When the Bill for four &s;hillings in the pound Land-tax came up, they put their &s;trength to carry a clau&s;e, that the Peers &s;hould $word$ $word$. And tho', in the way in which this $lau&s;$ w$span$ up, it could not be defended, yet they did
<PB N="105" REF="126">
all that was po&s;&s;ible, to put a &s;top to the Bill; and with unu|&s;ual vehemence pre&s;&s;ed for a delay, till a Committee &s;hould be appointed to examine Precedents. This the Earl of <HI>Mulgrave</HI> pre&s;&s;ed for many hours, with a force of Argument and Elo|quence, beyond any thing that I had ever heard in that Hou&s;e. He in&s;i&s;ted much upon the dignity of Peerage; and made this, which was now propo&s;ed, to be &s;o main a part of that dignity, that he exhau&s;ted all the topicks of Rhetorick, to convince the Lords, that, if they yielded to this, they dive&s;ted them&s;elves of their true greatne&s;s; and nothing would remain, but the name and &s;hadow of a Peer, which was but a Pageant. But after all the pomp and heat of his Oratory, the Lords con&s;idered the &s;afety of the Nation, more than the &s;hadow of a Privilege; And &s;o they pa&s;&s;ed the Bill.</P>
<P>The&s;e Lords al&s;o &s;et on foot a propo&s;ition, that had never been offered, but when the Nation was ready to break out into Civil Wars; And that was, that a Committee of Lords and Commons &s;hould be appointed to confer together, concerning the &s;tate of the Nation: This once begun, would have grown in a very &s;hort time, to have been a Council of State; And they would &s;oon have brought all affairs under their in&s;pection; But this was &s;o &s;trongly oppo&s;ed, that it was &s;oon let fall.</P>
<P>When the Party, that was &s;et again&s;t the Court, &s;aw they could carry nothing in either Hou&s;e of Parliament, then they turned their whole &s;trength again&s;t the pre&s;ent Parliament, to force a di&s;&s;olution; And in order to that, they fir&s;t loaded it with a name of an ill &s;ound; And, whereas King <HI>Charles</HI>'s Long Parliament was called the Pen&s;ioner Parliament, they called this the Officer's Parliament; becau&s;e many, that had Com|mands in the Army, were of it: And the word, that they gave out among the people, was, that we were to be governed by a &s;tanding Army, and a &s;tanding Parliament. They tried to carry a Bill, that render'd all Members of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons incapable of places of tru&s;t or profit; &s;o that every Mem|ber that accepted a place, &s;hould be expelled the Hou&s;e, and be incapable of being cho&s;en again, to &s;it in the current Parlia|ment. The truth was, it came to be ob&s;erved, that &s;ome got credit by oppo&s;ing the Government; and that to &s;ilence them, they were preferred: And then they changed their note, and were as ready to flatter, as before to find fault. This gave a &s;pecious colour to tho&s;e, who charged the Court with de&s;igns of corrupting Members, or at lea&s;t of &s;topping their mouths by places and pen&s;ions. When this Bill was &s;et on, it went through the Hou&s;e of Commons with little or no difficulty: Tho&s;e who
<PB N="106" REF="127">
were in places, had not &s;trength and credit to make great op|po&s;ition to it, they being the per&s;ons concerned, and looked on as Parties: And tho&s;e who had no places, had not the courage to oppo&s;e it; for in them it would have looked as an art to recommend them&s;elves to one. So the Bill pa&s;&s;ed in the Hou&s;e <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Bill to ex|clude Mem|bers of Par|liament from Places.</NOTE> of Commons: but it was rejected by the Lords; &s;ince it &s;eemed to e&s;tabli&s;h an oppo&s;ition between the Crown and the People, as if tho&s;e who were employed by the one, could not be tru&s;ted by the other.</P>
<P>When this failed, another attempt was made in the Hou&s;e <NOTE PLACE="marg">Another for a Triennial Parliament.</NOTE> of Lords; in a Bill that was offered, enacting, That a Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament &s;hould be held every year, and a new Parliament be &s;ummoned every third year, and that the pre&s;ent Parliament &s;hould be di&s;&s;olved within a limited time. The Statutes, for Annual Parliaments in King <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t, and King <HI>Edward</HI> the third's time, are well known. But it is a que&s;tion, whether the &s;uppo&s;ition <HI>if need be</HI> falls upon the whole Act, or only upon tho&s;e words, <HI>or oftner:</HI> It is certain the&s;e Acts were never ob|&s;erved; And the non-ob&s;ervance of them was never complained of as a grievance. Nor did the famous Act in King <HI>Charles</HI> the fir&s;t's time, carry the nece&s;&s;ity of holding a Se&s;&s;ion further, than to once in three years. Antiently, con&s;idering the ha&s;te and hurry in which Parliaments &s;at, an annual Parliament might be no great inconvenience to the Nation: But by rea&s;on of the &s;low methods of Se&s;&s;ions now, an annual Parliament in times of peace would become a very in&s;upportable grievance. A Par|liament of a long continuance, &s;eemed to be very dangerous, either to the Crown, or to the Nation: If the conjuncture, and their proceedings, gave them much credit, they might grow very unea&s;y to the Crown, as happened in King <HI>Charles</HI> the fir&s;t's time; Or in another &s;ituation of affairs, they might be &s;o prac|ti&s;ed upon by the Court, that they might give all the money, and all the liberties of <HI>England</HI> up, when they were to have a large &s;hare of the money, and were to be made the in&s;truments of Ty|ranny; as it was in King <HI>Charles</HI> the &s;econd's time. It was like|wi&s;e hoped, that frequent Parliaments would put an end to the great expence Candidates put them&s;elves to in Elections; and that it would oblige the Members to behave them&s;elves &s;o well, both with relation to the Publick, and in their private de|portment, as to recommend them to their Electors at three years end: Whereas when a Parliament was to &s;it many years, Members covered with Privileges were apt to take great liberties, for|got that they repre&s;ented others, and took care only of them&s;elves. So it was thought, that <HI>England</HI> would have a truer Repre&s;en|tative,
<PB N="107" REF="128">
when it was cho&s;en anew every third year, than when it run on to the end of a Reign. All that was objected again&s;t this was, that frequent Elections would make the Freeholders proud and in&s;olent, when they knew that applications mu&s;t be made to them at the end of three years: This would e&s;tabli&s;h a Faction in every body, that had a right to an Election; And whereas now an Election put men to a great charge all at once, then the charge mu&s;t be perpetual all the three years, in laying in for a new Election, when it was known how &s;oon it mu&s;t come round. And as for the di&s;&s;olution of the pre&s;ent Parlia|ment, &s;ome were for leaving it to the general triennial clau&s;e, that it might &s;till &s;it three years; They thought that, during &s;o critical a War, as that in which we were now engaged, it was not advi&s;able to venture on a new Election; &s;ince we had &s;o many among us, who were &s;o ill affected to the pre&s;ent E&s;ta|bli&s;hment: yet it was &s;aid, this Parliament had already &s;at three years; and therefore, it was not con&s;i&s;tent with the general rea&s;on of the Act, to let it continue longer. So the Bill pa&s;&s;ed in the Hou&s;e of Lords: And tho' a Bill from them, di&s;&s;olving a Parliament, &s;truck only at the Hou&s;e of Commons, the Lords being &s;till the &s;ame men; &s;o that, upon that &s;ingle account, many thought they would have rejected it, yet they al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed it, and fixed their own di&s;&s;olution to the twenty fifth of <HI>March</HI> in the next year; So that they re&s;erved another Se&s;&s;ion to them|&s;elves. The King let the Bill lie for &s;ome time on the Table; So that mens eyes and expectations were much fixed on the i&s;&s;ue of it. But in conclu&s;ion, he refu&s;ed to pa&s;s it; So the Se&s;&s;ion ended in ill humour. The rejecting a Bill, tho' an unque&s;tion|able right of the Crown, has been &s;o &s;eldom practi&s;ed, that the two Hou&s;es are apt to think it a hard&s;hip, when there is a Bill denied.</P>
<P>But to &s;often the di&s;ta&s;te this might otherwi&s;e give, the King <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Change in the Mi|ni&s;try.</NOTE> made con&s;iderable alterations in his Mini&s;try. All people were now grown weary of the Great Seal's being in Commi&s;&s;ion; It made the proceedings in Chancery, to be both more dilatory, and more expen&s;ive: And there were &s;uch exceptions made, to the Decrees of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, that Appeals were brought again&s;t mo&s;t of them, and generally they were rever&s;ed. Sir <HI>John Somers</HI> had now got great reputation, both in his Po&s;t of Attorney General, and in the Hou&s;e of Commons; So the King gave him the Great Seal. He was very learned in his own Profe&s;|&s;ion, with a great deal more Learning in other Profe&s;&s;ions, in Divinity, Philo&s;ophy, and Hi&s;tory. He had a great capacity for bu&s;ine&s;s, with an extraordinary temper: for he was fair and
<PB N="108" REF="129">
gentle, perhaps to a fault, con&s;idering his Po&s;t. So that he had all the patience and &s;oftne&s;s, as well as the ju&s;tice and equity, becoming a great Magi&s;trate. He had always agreed in his no|tions with the Whigs; and had &s;tudied to bring them to better thoughts of the King, and to a greater confidence in him. <HI>Trenchard</HI> was made Secretary of State: He had been engaged far with the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> as was told formerly. He got out of <HI>England,</HI> and lived &s;ome years beyond Sea, and had a right under&s;tanding of affairs abroad: He was a calm and &s;edate man; and was much more moderate, than could have been expected, &s;ince he was a leading man in a party. He had too great a regard to the Stars, and too little to Religion. The bringing the&s;e men into tho&s;e Po&s;ts, was a&s;cribed chiefly to the great credit the Earl of <HI>Sunderland</HI> had gained with the King; He had now got into his confidence, and declared openly for the Whigs. The&s;e advancements had a great effect on the whole party: and brought them to a much better opinion of the King. A young man, Mr. <HI>Montague,</HI> a branch of the Earl of <HI>Manche&s;ter</HI>'s family, began to make a great figure in the Hou&s;e of Commons. He was a Commi&s;&s;ioner of the Trea&s;ury, and &s;oon after made Chancellor of the Exchequer. He had great vivacity and clearne&s;s, both of thought and expre&s;&s;ion: His &s;pirit was at fir&s;t turned to Wit and Poetry, which he con|tinued &s;till to encourage in others, when he applied him&s;elf to more important bu&s;ine&s;s. He came to have great notions, with relation to all the concerns of the Trea&s;ury, and of the Publick Funds, and brought tho&s;e matters into new and better methods: He &s;hewed the error of giving money upon remote Funds, at a va&s;t di&s;count, and with great premiums to rai&s;e Loans upon them; which occa&s;ioned a great out-cry, at the &s;ums that were given, at the &s;ame time that they were much &s;hrunk, before they produced the money, that was expected from them. So he pre&s;&s;ed the King to in&s;i&s;t on this as a maxim, to have all the money for the &s;ervice of a year, to be rai&s;ed within that year.</P>
<P>But as the employing the&s;e men had a very good effect on <NOTE PLACE="marg">Factions formed a|gain&s;t the Court.</NOTE> the King's affairs, &s;o a party came to be now formed, that &s;tu|died to cro&s;s and defeat every thing; This was led by <HI>Seimour</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;grave.</HI> The la&s;t was a Gentleman of a noble family in <HI>Cumberland,</HI> who&s;e life had been regular, and his deportment grave. He had lo&s;t a place in King <HI>James</HI>'s time: for tho' he was always a high Tory, yet he would not comply with his de&s;igns. He had indeed contributed much to increa&s;e his re|venue, and to offer him more than he asked; yet he would not go into the taking off the Te&s;ts. Upon the Revolution,
<PB N="109" REF="130">
the place out of which he had been turned, was given to a man, that had a good &s;hare of merit in it. This alienated him from the King; And he, being a man of good judgment, and of great experience, came to be con&s;idered as the Head of the Party; in which he found his account &s;o well, that no offers that were made him, could ever bring him over to the King's Intere&s;ts. Upon many critical occa&s;ions, he gave up &s;ome im|portant points, for which the King found it nece&s;&s;ary to pay him very liberally.</P>
<P>But the Party of the Tories was too incon&s;iderable to have rai&s;ed a great oppo&s;ition, if a Body of Whigs had not joined with them; Some of the&s;e had &s;uch Republican notions, that they were much &s;et again&s;t the Prerogative: And they thought the King was become too &s;tiff in maintaining it: Others were offended, becau&s;e they were not con&s;idered nor preferred, as they thought they de&s;erved. The chief of the&s;e were, Mr. <HI>Paul Foley</HI> and Mr. <HI>Harley;</HI> The fir&s;t of the&s;e was a younger &s;on of one, who from mean beginnings had, by Iron Works, rai&s;ed one of the greate&s;t e&s;tates, that had been in <HI>England</HI> in our time. He was a learned, tho' not a practi&s;ing Lawyer; and was a man of vertue, and good principles, but moro&s;e and wil|ful: And he had the affectation of pa&s;&s;ing for a great Patriot, by his con&s;tant finding fault with the Government, and keeping up an ill humour, and a bad opinion of the Court. <HI>Harley</HI> was a man of a noble family, and very eminently learned; much turned to Politicks, and of a re&s;tle&s;s Ambition. He was a man of great indu&s;try and application; and knew forms, and the Records of Parliament &s;o well, that he was capable both of lengthening out, and of perplexing debates. Nothing could an&s;wer his a&s;piring temper: So He and <HI>Foley</HI> joined with the Tories to create jealou&s;ies, and rai&s;e an oppo&s;ition: They &s;oon grew to be able to delay matters long; and &s;et on foot &s;ome very unea&s;y things, that were popular; &s;uch as the Bill again&s;t Parliament men's being in places, and that for di&s;|&s;olving the Parliament, and for having a new one every third year.</P>
<P>That which gave them much &s;trength was, the King's cold and re&s;erved way; He took no pains to oblige tho&s;e that came to him; nor was he ea&s;y of acce&s;s; He lived out of Town at <HI>Ken&s;ington;</HI> And his chief Confidents were <HI>Dutch.</HI> He took no notice of the Clergy, and &s;eemed to have little concern in the matters of the Church, or of Religion: And at this time &s;ome Athei&s;ts and Dei&s;ts, as well as Socinians, were publi&s;hing Books again&s;t Religion in general, and more particularly again&s;t
<PB N="110" REF="131">
the My&s;teries of our Faith. The&s;e expre&s;&s;ed great zeal for the Government: which gave a handle to tho&s;e, who were waiting for all advantages, and were careful of increa&s;ing and improv|ing them, to &s;pread it all over the Nation, that the King, and tho&s;e about him, had no regard to Religion, nor to the Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But now I go on to the tran&s;actions of this Summer: The King had, in his Speech to the Parliament, told them, he intended to land a con&s;iderable Army in <HI>France</HI> this year. So after the Se&s;&s;ion, Orders were given for hiring a Fleet for Tran&s;ports, with &s;o great a train of Artillery, that it would have &s;erved an Army of forty thou&s;and men: This was very acceptable to the whole Nation, who loved an active War; and were very unea&s;y to &s;ee &s;o much money paid, and &s;o little done with it: But all this went off without any effect. The <HI>French</HI> had attempted this <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in <HI>Flanders.</HI></NOTE> Winter the Siege of <HI>Rhinfeldt,</HI> a place of no great con&s;equence. But it lay upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> not far from <HI>Coblentz;</HI> And by it <HI>Franconia</HI> would have been open to them. They could not cut off the communication by the <HI>Rhine:</HI> &s;o that fre&s;h &s;upplies of men and provi&s;ions were every day &s;ent to them, by the care of the Landgrave of <HI>He&s;&s;e,</HI> who managed the matter with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that after a fortnight's &s;tay before it, the <HI>French</HI> were forced to rai&s;e the Siege; which was a repul&s;e, &s;o &s;eldom given them, that upon it &s;ome &s;aid, they were then &s;ure, <HI>Louvoy</HI> was dead. The <HI>French</HI> had al&s;o made another attempt upon <HI>Huy,</HI> of a &s;horter continuance, but with the like &s;ucce&s;s. The Campaign was opened with great Pomp in <HI>Flanders:</HI> for the King of <HI>France</HI> came thither in per&s;on, accompanied by the Ladies of the Court, which appeared the more ridiculous, &s;ince there was no Queen at the head of them; unle&s;s Madam <HI>de Maintenon</HI> was to be taken for one, to whom re&s;pects were indeed paid with more &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, than is commonly done to Queens; &s;o that what might be wanting in the outward ceremony, was more than ballanced by the real authority that &s;he had. It was given out, that the King of <HI>France,</HI> after he had amu&s;ed the King for &s;ome days, intended to have turned either to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> on the one hand, or to <HI>Liege</HI> on the other. In the mean while the <HI>French</HI> were working on the <HI>Dutch,</HI> by their &s;ecret practices, to make them hearken to a &s;eparate Peace; And the ill humour that had appeared in the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> again&s;t them, was an ar|gument much made u&s;e of, to convince them how little ground they had, to tru&s;t to their Alliance with <HI>England:</HI> So that, as <HI>French</HI> pra$span$ had rai&s;ed this ill humour among us, they made now this u&s;e of it, to break our mutual confidence, and by con|&s;equence
<PB N="111" REF="132">
our Alliance with the <HI>States.</HI> The King made great ha&s;te, and brought his Army much &s;ooner together, than the <HI>French</HI> expected: He encamped at <HI>Park</HI> near <HI>Louvain;</HI> by which he broke all the <HI>French</HI> mea&s;ures: for he lay equally well po&s;ted to relieve <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> or <HI>Liege.</HI> It was grown the more nece&s;&s;ary to take care of <HI>Liege;</HI> becau&s;e tho' the Bi&s;hop was true to the Allies, yet there was a faction formed among the Capitulars, to offer them&s;elves to the <HI>French;</HI> But the Garri&s;on adhered to the Bi&s;hop; And now, when &s;o great an Army lay near them, they broke the mea&s;ures which that faction had taken. The <HI>French</HI> King, &s;eeing that the practices of treachery, on which he chiefly relied, &s;ucceeded &s;o ill, re&s;olved not to ven|ture him&s;elf in any dangerous enterprize; &s;o he and the Ladies went back to <HI>Ver&s;ailles.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Dauphin,</HI> with a great part of the Army, was &s;ent to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in the Empire.</NOTE> make head again&s;t the <HI>Germans,</HI> who had brought an Army together, commanded by the Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> the Landgrave of <HI>He&s;&s;e,</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Baden:</HI> The <HI>Germans</HI> moved &s;lowly, and were retarded by &s;ome di&s;putes about the Command: So that the <HI>French</HI> came on to <HI>Heidelberg,</HI> before they were ready to cover it: The Town could make no long re&s;i&s;tance; But it was too &s;oon abandoned by a timorous Governor. The <HI>French</HI> were not able to hinder the conjunction of the <HI>Germans,</HI> tho' they endeavoured it; They advanced towards them. And tho' the Dauphin was much &s;uperior in numbers, and &s;tudied to force them to action, yet they kept clo&s;e; and he did not think fit to attack them in their Camp. The <HI>French</HI> rai&s;ed great contributions in the <HI>Wirtemberg;</HI> But no action happened on the <HI>Rhine</HI> all this Campaign. The <HI>French</HI> had better &s;ucce&s;s and le&s;s oppo&s;ition in <HI>Catalonia:</HI> They took <HI>Ro&s;es,</HI> and ad|vanced to <HI>Barcelona,</HI> expecting their Fleet, which was to have bombarded it from the Sea, while their Army attacked it by Land: This put all <HI>Spain</HI> under a great con&s;ternation; The de&s;ign of this Inva&s;ion was, to force them to treat of a &s;eparate Peace; while they felt them&s;elves &s;o vigorou&s;ly attacked, and &s;aw that they were in no condition to re&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>Affairs in <HI>Piedmont</HI> gave them a &s;ea&s;onable relief: The Duke <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in Piedmont</NOTE> of <HI>Savoy</HI>'s motions were &s;o &s;low, that it &s;eemed, both &s;ides were re&s;olved to lie upon the defen&s;ive. The <HI>French</HI> were very weak there, and they expected to be as weakly oppo&s;ed. But in the end of <HI>July,</HI> the Duke began to move: And he obliged <HI>Cati|nat</HI> to retire with his &s;mall Army, having made him quit &s;ome of his Po&s;ts. And then he formed the Siege of St. <HI>Bridges,</HI> a fort that lay above <HI>Pigncrol,</HI> and, as was believed, might com|mand
<PB N="112" REF="133">
it. After twelve days Siege, the <HI>French</HI> abandoned it, and he was ma&s;ter of it. But he was not furni&s;hed for undertaking the Siege of <HI>Pignerol:</HI> And &s;o the Campaign went off in Marches and Countermarches: But in the end of it, <HI>Catinat,</HI> having increa&s;ed his Army by &s;ome detachments, came up to the Duke of <HI>Savoy.</HI> They engaged at <HI>Orba&s;&s;on,</HI> where the ho|nour of the action, but with that the greate&s;t lo&s;s, fell to the <HI>French:</HI> for tho' they carried it by their numbers, their bodies being le&s;s &s;pent and fuller, yet the re&s;i&s;tance that was made, was &s;uch, that the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> gained more in his reputation, than he &s;uffered by the lo&s;s of the day.</P>
<P>The two Armies lay long in <HI>Flanders,</HI> watching one another's <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Battle of <HI>$word$.</HI></NOTE> motions, without coming to action. In <HI>July, Luxemburgh</HI> went to be&s;iege <HI>Huy,</HI> and carried it in two or three days. The King moved that way, on de&s;ign either to rai&s;e the Siege, or to force a Battle. Tho&s;e in <HI>Huy</HI> did not give him time to come to their relief; And <HI>Luxemburgh</HI> made a feint towards <HI>Liege,</HI> which obliged the King to &s;end &s;ome Battallions to reinforce the Garri&s;on of that Place. He had al&s;o &s;ent another great detach|ment, commanded by the Duke of <HI>Wirtemberg,</HI> to force the <HI>French</HI> Lines, and to put their Country under Contribution; which he executed with great &s;ucce&s;s, and rai&s;ed above four millions. <HI>Luxemburgh</HI> thought this was an advantage not to be lo&s;t: So that, as &s;oon as he had received Orders from the King of <HI>France</HI> to attack the King in his Camp, He came up to him near <HI>Landen,</HI> upon the River <HI>Gitte.</HI> He was about double the King's number, chiefly in Hor&s;e. The King might have &s;ecured him&s;elf from all attacks, by pa&s;&s;ing the River: And his conduct in not doing it, was much cen&s;ured, con&s;idering his &s;trength, and the Enemy's. He cho&s;e rather to &s;tay for them; But &s;ent away the Baggage and heavy Cannon to <HI>Mechelen;</HI> and &s;pent the whole night in planting Batteries, and ca&s;ting up Retrenchments. On the twenty ninth of <HI>July,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> be|gan their attack, early in the morning, and came on with great re&s;olution, tho' the King's Cannon did great execution: They were beat off, with the lo&s;s of many Officers in &s;everal attacks: Yet they came &s;till on with fre&s;h Bodies; till at la&s;t, after an action of &s;even or eight hours continuance, they broke through, in a place where there was &s;uch a Body of <HI>German</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Hor&s;e, that the Army on no &s;ide was thought le&s;s in danger. The&s;e Troops gave way; And &s;o the <HI>French</HI> carried the honour of the day, and were ma&s;ters both of the King's Camp and Can|non: But the King pa&s;&s;ed the river, and cut the bridges, and $word$ &s;ecure out of reach. He had &s;upported the whole action
<PB N="113" REF="134">
with &s;o much courage, and &s;o true a judgment, that it was thought, he got more honour that day, than even when he triumphed at the <HI>Boyne:</HI> He charged him&s;elf in &s;everal places. Many were &s;hot round about him, with the Enemies Cannon: One musket-&s;hot carried away part of his &s;carf, and another went through his hat, without doing him any harm. The <HI>French</HI> lo&s;t &s;o many men, and &s;uffered &s;o much, in the &s;everal on&s;ets they had made, that they were not able to pur&s;ue a Vic|tory, which co&s;t them &s;o dear. We lo&s;t in all about 7000: And among the&s;e, there was &s;carce an Officer of note; Only the Count <HI>de Solms</HI> had his Leg &s;hot off by a Cannon Ball, of which he died in a few hours. By all the accounts that came from <HI>France,</HI> it appeared, that the <HI>French</HI> had lo&s;t double the number, with a va&s;tly greater proportion of Officers. The King's behaviour, during the Battle, and in the retreat, was much magnified by the Enemy, as well as by his own &s;ide. The King of <HI>France</HI> was reported to have &s;aid upon it, that <HI>Luxemburgh</HI>'s behaviour was like the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI>'s, but the King's like M. <HI>Turenne</HI>'s. His Army was, in a few days, as &s;trong as ever, by recalling the Duke of <HI>Wirtemberg,</HI> and the Batallions he had &s;ent to <HI>Liege,</HI> and &s;ome other Bodies, that he drew out of Garri&s;ons. And the re&s;t of the Campaign pa&s;t over, without any other action; Only at the end of it, after the King had left the Army, <HI>Charleroy</HI> was be&s;ieged by the <HI>French:</HI> The Country about it had been &s;o eat up, that it was not po&s;|&s;ible <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Charleroy</HI> taken by the <HI>French.</HI></NOTE> to &s;ub&s;i&s;t an Army, that might have been brought to re|lieve it: The Garri&s;on made a brave re&s;i&s;tance, and held out a month; But it was taken at la&s;t.</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>French</HI> triumphed every where: But their &s;ucce&s;&s;es <NOTE PLACE="marg">Attempts made for a Peace.</NOTE> were more than ballanced by two bad harve&s;ts, that came &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively one after another: They had al&s;o &s;uffered much in their vintage; &s;o that they had neither bread nor wine. Great diligence was u&s;ed to bring in Corn from all parts; And &s;trict Orders were given by that Court, for regulating the price of it; and for furni&s;hing their Markets: There was al&s;o a liberal di&s;tribution ordered by that King, for the relief of the poor. But mi&s;ery will be mi&s;ery &s;till, after all po&s;&s;ible care to alleviate it; Great multitudes peri&s;hed for want, and the whole King|dom fell under an extream poverty: So that all the pomp of their Victories could not make them ea&s;y at home. They tried all po&s;&s;ible methods for bringing about a general Peace; or if that failed, for a &s;eparate Peace with &s;ome of the Con&s;ederates; But there was no di&s;po&s;ition in any of them to hearken to it; nor could they engage the Northern Crowns to offer their me|diation.
<PB N="114" REF="135">
Some &s;teps were indeed made; for they offered to acknowledge the pre&s;ent Government of <HI>England:</HI> But in all other points, their demands were &s;till &s;o high, that there was no pro&s;pect of a ju&s;t Peace, till their affairs &s;hould have brought them to an humbler po&s;ture.</P>
<P>But while the Campaign, in all its &s;cenes, was thus unequal and various, the <HI>French,</HI> tho' much weaker at Sea, were the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Our Affairs at Sea.</NOTE> mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful there: And tho' we had the &s;uperior &s;trength, we were very unpro&s;perous; And by our ill conduct we lo&s;t much, both in our honour and intere&s;t, on that Element. The great difficulty that the <HI>French</HI> were under in their Marine was, by rea&s;on of their two great Ports, <HI>Bre&s;t</HI> and <HI>Toulon;</HI> and from the bringing their Fleets together, and &s;ending them back again. The danger they ran in that, and the delays that it put them under, were the chief occa&s;ions of their lo&s;&s;es la&s;t year: But the&s;e were, in a great mea&s;ure, made up to them now. We were &s;ending a very rich Fleet of Merchants Ships to the Me|diterranean, which was valued at many millions; Some of the&s;e had lain ready a year and a half, waiting for a Convoy, but were &s;till put off by new delays; nor could they obtain one after <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI>'s Victory, tho' we were then Ma&s;ters at Sea. They were promi&s;ed a great one in Winter. The number of the Merchant Ships did &s;till increa&s;e; &s;o that the Convoy, which was at fir&s;t de&s;igned, was not thought equal to the riches of the Fleet, and to the danger they might run by Ships, that might be &s;ent from <HI>Toulon</HI> to intercept them. The Court of <HI>France</HI> was watch|ing this carefully: A Spy among the Jacobites gave advice, that certain Per&s;ons &s;ent from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>France,</HI> to &s;hew with how &s;mall a force they might make them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of that King|dom, had hopes given them for &s;ome time; Upon which &s;everal military men went to <HI>Lanca&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Northumberland,</HI> to &s;ee what could be expected from thence, if commotions &s;hould happen in <HI>Scotland:</HI> But in <HI>February</HI> the <HI>French</HI> &s;aid, they could not do what was expected; And the <HI>Scotch</HI> Agents were told, that they were obliged to look after the <HI>Smirna</HI> Fleet; which they reckoned might be of more con&s;equence, than even the carrying <HI>Scotland</HI> could be. The Fleet was ready in <HI>February,</HI> But new excu&s;es were again made; For it was &s;aid, the Convoy mu&s;t be increa&s;ed to twenty Men of War; <HI>Rook</HI> was to com|mand it; A new delay was likewi&s;e put in, on the pretence of &s;taying for advice from <HI>Toulon,</HI> whether the Squadron that was laid up there, was to lie in the Mediterranean this year, or to come about to <HI>Bre&s;t.</HI> The Merchants were very unea&s;y under tho&s;e delays; &s;ince the charge was like to eat up the profit of
<PB N="115" REF="136">
the Voyage: But no di&s;patch could be had; and very probable rea&s;ons were offered to ju&s;tify every new retardment. The <HI>French</HI> Fleet had gone early out of <HI>Toulon,</HI> on de&s;ign to have de&s;troyed the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Fleet, which lay in the Bay of <HI>Puzzolo;</HI> But they lay &s;o &s;afe there, that the <HI>French</HI> &s;aw they could not &s;ucceed in any attempt upon them; Afterwards they &s;tood off to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Catalonia,</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t their Army, which was mak|ing &s;ome Conque&s;ts there. Yet the&s;e were only feints to amu&s;e and to cover their true de&s;ign. The Fleet at <HI>Bre&s;t</HI> &s;ailed away from thence &s;o &s;uddenly, that they were neither compleatly manned nor victualled; And they came to <HI>Lagos</HI> Bay in <HI>Al|garve.</HI> Tenders were &s;ent after them, with the nece&s;&s;ary Com|plement of men and provi&s;ions; This &s;udden and unprovided motion of the <HI>French</HI> Fleet looked, as if &s;ome &s;ecret advice had been &s;ent from <HI>England,</HI> acquainting them with our de&s;igns. But at the Secretary's office, not only there was no Intelligence concerning their Fleet, but when a Ship came in, that brought the news of their having &s;ailed from <HI>Bre&s;t,</HI> they were not be|lieved. Our main Fleet &s;ailed out into the Sea, for &s;ome leagues with <HI>Rook,</HI> and the Merchant Ships: And when they thought they were out of danger, they came back. <HI>Rook</HI> was unhappy in that, which, upon any other occa&s;ion, would have been a great happine&s;s; He had a fair and a &s;trong gale of wind; &s;o that no advice &s;ent after him could overtake him: Nor did he meet with any Ships at Sea, that could give him notice of the dan|ger that lay before him. He doubled the Cape of St. <HI>Vincent,</HI> and had almo&s;t fallen in with the <HI>French</HI> Fleet, before he was aware of it: He dreamed of no danger, but from the <HI>Toulon</HI> Squadron, till he took a Fire-&s;hip; The Captain whereof en|deavoured to deceive him, by a fal&s;e &s;tory, as if there had been only fifteen men of War lying at <HI>Lagos,</HI> that intended to join <HI>D'E&s;trees:</HI> The Merchants were for going on, and believed the information; They were confirmed in this, by the di&s;order the <HI>French</HI> &s;eemed to be in; for they were cutting their cables, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turky</HI> Fleet in great dan|ger.</NOTE> and drawing near the Shore. The truth was, when they &s;aw <HI>Rook</HI>'s Fleet, they apprehended, by their numbers, that the whole Fleet of <HI>England</HI> was coming toward them: And indeed had they come &s;o far with them, here was an occa&s;ion offered, which perhaps may not be found again in an Age, of de&s;troying their whole &s;trength at Sea. But as the <HI>French</HI> &s;oon perceived their error, and were forming them&s;elves into a Line; <HI>Rook</HI> &s;aw his error likewi&s;e, and &s;tood out to Sea, while the Merchants fled, as their fears drove them; a great many of them &s;tick|ing &s;till clo&s;e to him: Others &s;ailed to <HI>Cadiz,</HI> and &s;ome got to
<PB N="116" REF="137">
<HI>Gibraltar:</HI> And in&s;tead of pur&s;uing their Voyage, put in there: Some Ships were burnt or &s;unk, and a very &s;mall number was taken by the <HI>French.</HI> They did not pur&s;ue <HI>Rook,</HI> but let him &s;ail away to the <HI>Maderas;</HI> And from thence he came, fir&s;t to <HI>Kin&s;ale,</HI> and then into <HI>England.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> tried what they could do upon <HI>Cadiz;</HI> but found that it was not practicable. They came next to <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> where the Mer|chants &s;unk their Ships, to prevent their falling into their hands: From thence they &s;ailed along the Coa&s;t of <HI>Spain,</HI> and burnt &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships, that were laying at <HI>Malaga, Alicant,</HI> and in &s;ome other places. They hoped to have de|&s;troyed the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Fleet; But they put in at <HI>Port Mahone,</HI> where they were &s;afe: At length, after a very glorious Cam|paign, the <HI>French</HI> came back to <HI>Toulon:</HI> It is certain, if <HI>Tour|ville</HI> had made u&s;e of all his advantages, and had executed the de&s;ign, as well as it was projected, he might have done us much mi&s;chief; Few of our Men of War, or Merchant-men, could have got of his hands: The lo&s;s fell heavie&s;t on the <HI>Dutch:</HI> The Voyage was quite lo&s;t; And the di&s;grace of it was vi&s;ible to the whole World, and very &s;en&s;ible to the trading part of the Nation.</P>
<P>The appearances were &s;uch, that it was generally &s;urmi&s;ed, our Coun&s;els were betrayed. The Secretary, that attended on the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Jea|lou&s;ies of the King's Mi|ni&s;try.</NOTE> Admirals, was much &s;u&s;pected, and charged with many things: But the &s;u&s;picions ro&s;e high, even as to the Secretary of State's office. It was &s;aid, that our Fleet was kept in port, till the <HI>French</HI> were laid in their way, and was then ordered to &s;ail, that it might fall into their hands: Many particulars were laid together, which had &s;uch colours, that it was not to be won|dred at, if they created jealou&s;y, e&s;pecially in minds &s;ufficiently prepared for it. Upon enquiry it appeared, that &s;everal of tho&s;e, who, for the la&s;t two years, were put in the &s;ubaltern employ|ments, through the Kingdom, did upon many occa&s;ions &s;hew a di&s;affection to the Government, and talked and acted like E|nemies. Our want of intelligence of the motions of the <HI>French,</HI> while they &s;eemed to know every thing that we either did, or de&s;igned to do, ca&s;t a heavy reproach upon our Mini&s;ters, who were now broke &s;o in pieces, that they acted without union or concert: Every one &s;tudied to ju&s;tify him&s;elf, and to throw the blame on others: A good &s;hare of this was ca&s;t on the Earl of <HI>Nottingham;</HI> The Marqui&s;s of <HI>Caermarthen</HI> was much &s;u&s;pected: The Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> began now to have great credit with the Queen; and &s;eemed to be &s;o violently &s;et again&s;t the Whigs, that they looked for dreadful things from him, if he came again
<PB N="117" REF="138">
to govern: For, being naturally warm, and apt to heat him|&s;elf in company, he broke out into Sallies, which were carried about, and began to create jealou&s;ies, even of the Queen her &s;elf.</P>
<P>I was in &s;ome &s;ort an&s;werable for this: For, when the Queen came into <HI>England,</HI> &s;he was &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed again&s;t him, that he tried all his Friends and Intere&s;t in the Court, to be admitted to clear him&s;elf, and to recover her favour, but all in vain; for they found her &s;o alienated from him, that no per&s;on would un|dertake it. Upon that, he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me: I thought that, if he came into the &s;ervice of the Government, his relation to the Queen would make him firm and zealous for it: And I &s;erved him &s;o effectually, that the Queen laid a&s;ide all her re|&s;entments, and admitted him, by degrees, into a high mea&s;ure of favour and confidence. I quickly &s;aw my error: And he took pains to convince me effectually of it: For he was no &s;ooner po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of her favour, than he went into an intere&s;t, very dif|ferent from what I believed he would have pur&s;ued. He talked again&s;t all favour to Di&s;&s;enters, and for &s;etting up the notions of Per&s;ecution and Violence, which he had &s;o much promoted in King <HI>Charles</HI>'s time, and profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf an enemy to the pre&s;ent Bi&s;hops, and to the methods they were taking, of preach|ing and vi&s;iting their Dioce&s;es, of obliging the Clergy to attend more carefully to their Functions, and of endeavouring to gain the Di&s;&s;enters by gentle and calm methods.</P>
<P>The King had left the matters of the Church wholly in the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The State of the Clergy and Church.</NOTE> Queen's hands. He found he could not re&s;i&s;t Importunities, which were not only vexatious to him, but had drawn prefer|ments from him, which he came &s;oon to &s;ee were ill be&s;towed: So he devolved that care upon the Queen, which &s;he managed with &s;trict and religious prudence: She declared openly again&s;t the preferring of tho&s;e, who put in for them&s;elves; and took care to inform her&s;elf particularly of the merits of &s;uch of the Clergy, as were not &s;o much as known at Court, nor u&s;ing any methods to get them&s;elves recommended: So that we had rea|&s;on to hope, that, if this cour&s;e &s;hould be long continued, it would produce a great change in the Church, and in the temper of the Clergy. She con&s;ulted chiefly with the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canter|bury,</HI> whom &s;he favoured and &s;upported in a mo&s;t particular manner. She &s;aw what need there was of it: For a party was formed again&s;t him, who &s;et them&s;elves to cen&s;ure every thing he did. It was a melancholy thing to con&s;ider that, tho' we never &s;aw an Archbi&s;hop before him, apply him&s;elf &s;o entirely, without partiality or bia&s;s, to all the concerns of the Church and
<PB N="118" REF="139">
Religion, as he did; and that the Queen's heart was &s;et on promoting them, yet &s;uch an evil &s;pirit &s;hould &s;eem to be let loo&s;e upon the Clergy. They complained of every thing that was done, if it was not in their own way: And the Archbi&s;hop bore the blame of all. He did not enter into any clo&s;e corre|&s;pondence, or the concerting mea&s;ures with the Mini&s;try, but lived much ab&s;tracted from them: So they &s;tudied to depre&s;s him all they could. This made a great impre&s;&s;ion upon him. He grew very unea&s;y in his great Po&s;t: We were all &s;oon convinced, that there was a &s;ort of Clergymen among us, that would never be &s;atisfied, as long as the Toleration was continued: And they &s;eemed re&s;olved to give it out, that the Church was in danger, till a pro&s;ecution of Di&s;&s;enters &s;hould be again &s;et on foot: Nor could they look at a man with patience, or &s;peak of him with temper, who did not agree with them in the&s;e things. The Bi|&s;hops fell under the di&s;plea&s;ure of the Whigs, by the methods they took, not only of protecting, but of preferring &s;ome of the&s;e men, hoping by that means both to have &s;oftned them, and their friends: But they took their preferments, as the rewards that they &s;uppo&s;ed were due to their merit; and they employed the credit and authority which their preferments brought them, wholly again&s;t tho&s;e to whom they owed them. The Whigs were much turned again&s;t the King; and were not plea&s;ed with tho&s;e who had left them, when they were &s;o violent in the begin|ning of this Reign: And it was a hard thing, in &s;uch a divided time, to re&s;olve to be of no party, &s;ince men of that temper are pu&s;hed at by many, and protected by no &s;ide. Of this we had many in&s;tances at that time: And I my&s;elf had &s;ome very &s;en|&s;ible ones: but they are too incon&s;iderable to be mentioned. In this bad &s;tate we were, when a Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament came on with great apprehen&s;ions, occa&s;ioned by our ill &s;ucce&s;s, and by the King's temper, which he could no way con&s;train, or render more complai&s;ant, but chiefly from the di&s;po&s;ition of mens minds, which was practi&s;ed on with great indu&s;try, by the ene|mies of the Government, who were driving on Jealou&s;ies daily.</P>
<P>A Parliament had been &s;ummoned in <HI>Ireland</HI> by the Lord <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in <HI>Ireland</HI></NOTE> <HI>Sidney;</HI> But they met full of di&s;content, and were di&s;po&s;ed to find fault with every thing: And there was too much matter to work upon; for the Lord Lieutenant was apt to excu&s;e or ju&s;tify tho&s;e, who had the addre&s;s to in&s;inuate them&s;elves into his fa|vour: So that they were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, before they brought their Bills to perfection. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in <HI>Ireland</HI> thought the Go|vernment favoured the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> too much; &s;ome &s;aid, this was the effect of Bribery, whereas others thought, it was nece&s;&s;ary to
<PB N="119" REF="140">
keep them &s;afe from the pro&s;ecutions of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who hated them, and were much &s;harpned again&s;t them. The protecting the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> was indeed in &s;ome &s;ort nece&s;&s;ary, to keep them from breaking out, or from running over to the <HI>French:</HI> But it was very plain, that the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> were <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> &s;till, enemies to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, and to the pre&s;ent Government: So that all kindne&s;s &s;hewed them, beyond what was due in &s;trict ju&s;tice, was the cheri&s;hing an inveterate enemy. There were al&s;o great com|plaints of an ill Admini&s;tration, chiefly in the Revenue, in the pay of the Army, and in the embezzelling of Stores. Of the&s;e, much noi&s;e was made in <HI>England,</HI> which drew Addre&s;&s;es from both Hou&s;es of Parliament to the King, which were very invi|diou&s;ly penned: Every particular being &s;everely aggravated. So the King called back the Lord <HI>Sidney,</HI> and put the Government of <HI>Ireland,</HI> into three Lords Ju&s;tices; Lord <HI>Capel,</HI> Brother to the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> Sir <HI>Cyril Wyche,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Duncomb.</HI> When they were &s;ent from Court, the Queen did very earne&s;tly re|commend to their care, the reforming of many di&s;orders, that were prevailing in that Kingdom: For, neither had the late de&s;tructive War, out of which they were but beginning to re|cover them&s;elves, nor their poverty, produced tho&s;e effects, that might have been well expected.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of <HI>Ireland</HI> leads me to in&s;ert here a very particular <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen's Strictne&s;s and pious De&s;igns.</NOTE> in&s;tance of the Queen's pious care, in the di&s;po&s;ing of Bi&s;hopricks: Lord <HI>Sidney</HI> was &s;o far engaged in the intere&s;t of a great Fa|mily of <HI>Ireland,</HI> that he was too ea&s;ily wrought on, to recom|mend a Branch of it to a vacant See. The repre&s;entation was made with an undue character of the per&s;on: So the Queen granted it. But when &s;he under&s;tood, that he lay under a very bad character, &s;he wrote a letter, in her own hand, to Lord <HI>Sidney,</HI> letting him know what &s;he had heard, and ordered him to call for &s;ix <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Bi&s;hops, whom &s;he named to him, and to require them to certify to her their opinion of that per&s;on: They all agreed, that he laboured under an ill fame: And, till that was examined into, they did not think it proper to promote him; &s;o that matter was let fall. I do not name the per&s;on; for I intend not to leave a blemi&s;h on him: But &s;et this down as an Example, fit to be imitated by Chri&s;tian Princes.</P>
<P>Another effect of the Queen's pious care of the Souls of her people was fini&s;hed this year, after it had been much oppo&s;ed, and long &s;topped. Mr. <HI>Blair,</HI> a very worthy man, came over from <HI>Virginia,</HI> with a propo&s;ition for erecting a College there. In order to which, he had &s;et on foot a voluntary Sub&s;cription, which aro&s;e to a great Sum: And he found out &s;ome branches
<PB N="120" REF="141">
of the Revenue there, that went all into private hands, without being brought into any publick account, with which a Free-School and College might be well endowed. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> born there were, as he &s;aid, capable of every thing, if they were pro|vided with the means of a good education; And a foundation of this kind in <HI>Virginia,</HI> that lay in the middle, between our Southern and Northern Plantations, might be a common Nur|&s;ery to them all; and put the people born there, in a way of further improvement. Tho&s;e concerned in the management of the Plantations, had made &s;uch advantages of tho&s;e particulars, out of which the Endowment was to be rai&s;ed, that all po&s;&s;ible objections were made to the Project, as a de&s;ign that would take our Planters off from their mechanical employments, and make them grow too knowing, to be obedient and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive. The Queen was &s;o well plea&s;ed with the de&s;ign, as apprehend|ing the very good effects it might have, that no objection a|gain&s;t it could move her: She hoped, it might be a means of improving her own people, and of preparing &s;ome to propagate the Go&s;pel among the Natives; And therefore, as &s;he e&s;pou&s;ed the matter with a particular zeal, &s;o the King did very readily concur with her in it. The Endowment was fixed, and the Patent was pa&s;&s;ed for the College, called from the Founders, the <HI>William</HI> and <HI>Mary</HI> College.</P>
<P>Affairs in <HI>Scotland</HI> grew more and more out of joint. Many <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> whom the King had tru&s;ted in the Mini&s;try there, were thought enemies to Him and his Government; and &s;ome took &s;o little care to conceal their inclinations, that, when an Inva&s;ion was looked for, they &s;eemed re&s;olved to join in it. They were taken out of a Plot, which was managed by per&s;wading many to take Oaths to the Government, on de&s;ign to betray it; and were now tru&s;ted with the mo&s;t important Po&s;ts. The Presbyterians began to &s;ee their error, in driving matters &s;o far, and in provok|ing the King &s;o much; And they &s;eemed de&s;irous to recover his favour, and to manage their matters with more temper. The King came likewi&s;e to &s;ee, that he had been a little too &s;udden in tru&s;ting &s;ome, who did not de&s;erve his confidence. Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> had for &s;ome years withdrawn from bu&s;ine&s;s; But he was now prevailed with to return to Council; Many Letters were intercepted between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Scotland:</HI> In tho&s;e from <HI>Scot|land,</HI> the ea&s;ine&s;s of engaging that Nation was often repeated, if no time were lo&s;t; It &s;eemed therefore nece&s;&s;ary to bring that Kingdom into a better &s;tate.</P>
<P>A Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament was held there, to which Duke <HI>Ha|milton</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament there.</NOTE> was &s;ent as the King's Commi&s;&s;ioner; The Supplies that
<PB N="121" REF="142">
were asked were granted; And now the whole Presbyterian Party was again entire in the King's Intere&s;t; The matters of the Church were brought to more temper, than was expected: The Epi&s;copal Clergy had more moderate terms offered them; They were only required to make an Addre&s;s to the General A&s;&s;embly, offering to &s;ub&s;cribe to a Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith, and to acknow|ledge Presbytery to be the only Government of that Church, with a promi&s;e to &s;ubmit to it; upon which, within a fortnight after they did that, if no matter of &s;candal was objected to them, the A&s;&s;embly was either to receive them into the Govern|ment of the Church; or, if they could not be brought to that, the King was to take them into his protection, and maintain them in their Churches, without any dependance on the Pre&s;|bytery. This was a &s;train of Moderation, that the Presbyterians were not ea&s;ily brought to; A Sub&s;cription that owned Presby|tery to be the only Legal Government of that Church, without owning any Divine Right in it, was far below their u&s;ual pre|ten&s;ions. And this Act ve&s;ted the King with an authority, very like that which they were wont to condemn as <HI>Era&s;tiani&s;m.</HI> Another act was al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed, requiring all in any Office in Church or State, to take, be&s;ides the Oath of Allegiance, a Declaration called the <HI>A&s;&s;urance,</HI> owning the King and Queen to be their rightful and lawful Sovereigns, and promi&s;ing Fidelity to them again&s;t King <HI>James,</HI> and all his Adherents. The Council was al&s;o impowered to tender the&s;e, as they &s;hould &s;ee cau&s;e for it, and to fine and impri&s;on &s;uch as &s;hould refu&s;e them. When the Se&s;&s;ion was near an end, <HI>Nevil Payne</HI> was brought before the Parliament, to be examined, upon the many Letters that had been intercepted. There was a full evidence again&s;t him in many of his own Letters; But he &s;ent word to &s;everal of the Lords, in particular to Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> that as long as his Life was his own, he would accu&s;e none: But he was re&s;olved he would not die; and he could di&s;cover enough to de&s;erve his pardon. This &s;truck &s;uch terror into many of them, who&s;e Sons or near Relations had been concerned with him, that he moving for a delay, on a pretence of &s;ome witne&s;&s;es that were not then at hand, a time was given him beyond the continu|ance of the Se&s;&s;ion; &s;o he e&s;caped, and that enquiry was &s;tifled: The Se&s;&s;ion ended calmly. But the King &s;eemed to have for|got <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;o entirely, that he let three months go over, before he took notice of any of their Petitions: And, tho' he had asked, and had Supplies for an Augmentation of Forces; and many had been gained to con&s;ent to the Tax, by the hope of Commi&s;&s;ions in the Troops, that were to be levied; yet the
<PB N="122" REF="143">
King did not rai&s;e any new ones, but rai&s;ed the Supply, and applied it to other u&s;es: This began again to rai&s;e an ill humour, that had been almo&s;t quite laid down, in the whole cour&s;e of this Se&s;&s;ion, which was thought a reconciling One. The Clergy let the day prefixed, for making their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the A&s;&s;embly, &s;lip, and did not take the Oaths; &s;o they could claim no Bene|fit by the Act, that had been carried in their favour, not without &s;ome difficulty. And the Law, that was intended to &s;ave them, did now expo&s;e them to ruine; &s;ince by it, they, not taking the Oaths, had lo&s;t their Legal Rights to their Benefices. Yet they were &s;uffered to continue in them, and were put in hope, that the King would protect them, tho' it was now again&s;t Law. They were al&s;o made to believe, that the King did not de&s;ire that they &s;hould take the Oaths, or make any &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to Presbytery: And it is certain, that no publick &s;ignification of the King's mind was made to them; &s;o they were ea&s;ily impo&s;|ed on by &s;urmizes and whi&s;pers; upon this the di&s;tractions grew up afre&s;h. Many concluded there, as well as in <HI>England,</HI> that the King's heart led him &s;till to court his Enemies, even after all the manife&s;t rea&s;ons he had to conclude, that the &s;teps they made towards him were only feign'd Submi&s;&s;ions, to gain &s;uch a Confidence, as might put it in their power to deliver him up.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Middletoun</HI> went over to <HI>France,</HI> in the begin|ning of this Year: And it was believed, he was &s;ent by a great <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earl of <HI>Middletoun</HI> went to <HI>France.</HI></NOTE> body among us, with a Propo&s;ition, which, had he had the a&s;|&s;urance to have made, and they the wi&s;dom to have accepted, might have much increa&s;ed our Factions and Jealou&s;ies. It was, that King <HI>James</HI> &s;hould offer to re&s;ign his Title in fa|vour of his Son, and likewi&s;e to &s;end him to be bred in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> under the direction of a Parliament, till he &s;hould be of Age; But I could never hear that he ventured on this advice; in another he &s;ucceeded better. When King <HI>James</HI> thought the Inva&s;ion from <HI>Normandy,</HI> the former Year, was &s;o well laid, that he &s;eemed not to apprehend it could mi&s;carry, he had pre|pared a Declaration, of which &s;ome Copies came over. He promi&s;ed nothing in it, and pardoned no body by it. But he &s;poke in the &s;tile of a Conquerour, who thought he was Ma|&s;ter, and therefore would limit him&s;elf by no promi&s;es, but &s;uch as were conceived in general words, which might be afterwards expounded at plea&s;ure. This was much blamed, even by his own party, who thought that they them&s;elves were not enough &s;e|cured by &s;o loo&s;e a Declaration: &s;o the Earl of <HI>Middletoun,</HI> upon his going over, procured one of another &s;train, which, as far as
<PB N="123" REF="144">
Words could go, gave all content: For he promi&s;ed every thing, and pardoned all per&s;ons. His Party got this into their hands; I &s;aw a Copy of it, and they waited for a fit occa&s;ion to pub|li&s;h it to the Nation.</P>
<P>We were al&s;o at this time alarmed with a Negotiation, that the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI> of|fered to the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></NOTE> Court of <HI>France</HI> was &s;etting on Foot at <HI>Madrid:</HI> They offered to re&s;tore to the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> all that had been taken from it, &s;ince the Peace of <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> on condition that the Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI> &s;hould be declared the Heir of that Crown, in default of I&s;&s;ue by the King: The Grandees of <HI>Spain,</HI> who are bred up to a di&s;regard and contempt of all the World be&s;ides them&s;elves, were inclinable to entertain this Propo&s;ition; tho' they &s;aw that by &s;o doing, they mu&s;t lo&s;e the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and many of their other Allies. But the King him&s;elf, weak as he was, &s;tood firm and intractable; and &s;eem|ed to be as much &s;et on watching their conduct, as a man of his low Genius could po&s;&s;ibly be. He re&s;olved to adhere to the Alliance, and to carry on the War; tho' he could do little more than barely re&s;olve on it. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> thought of nothing, but their Intrigues at <HI>Madrid;</HI> And for the manage|ment of the War, and all their affairs, they left the care of that to their Stars, and to their Allies.</P>
<P>The King came over to <HI>England</HI> in <HI>November;</HI> He &s;aw the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of <HI>Shrews|bury</HI> is again made Secre|tary of State.</NOTE> nece&s;&s;ity of changing both his Mea&s;ures and his Mini&s;ters; He expre&s;&s;ed his di&s;like of the whole conduct at Sea; and named <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> for the Command of the Fleet next Year: He di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the Earl of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> and would immediately have brought the Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> again into the Mini&s;try: But when that Lord came to him, he thought the King's Inclinations were &s;till the &s;ame, that they had been for &s;ome Years, and that the turn, which he was now making, was not from choice, but force; So that went off; and the Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> went into the Coun|try: Yet the King &s;oon after &s;ent for him, and gave him &s;uch a&s;&s;urances, that he was again made Secretary of State, to the general &s;atisfaction of the Whigs. But the per&s;on, that had the King's Confidence to the highe&s;t degree, was the Earl of <HI>Sun|derland,</HI> who, by his long experience and his knowledge of men and things, had gained an a&s;cendant over him, and had more credit with him, than any <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> ever had: He had brought the King to this Change of Councils, by the pro&s;pect he gave him of the ill condition his affairs were in, if he did not entirely both tru&s;t and &s;atisfy tho&s;e, who, in the pre&s;ent conjuncture, were the only party, that both could and would &s;upport him. It was &s;aid, that the true &s;ecret of this change of
<PB N="$24" REF="145">
mea&s;ures was, that the Tories &s;ignified to the King plainly, that they could carry on the War no longer, and that therefore he mu&s;t accept of &s;uch a Peace, as could be had: This was the mo&s;t pernicious thing that could be thought on, and the mo&s;t contrary to the King's notions and de&s;igns; but they being po|&s;itive, he was forced to change hands, and to turn to the other Party; So the Whigs were now in favour again, and every thing was done that was like to put them in good humour. The Commi&s;&s;ion of the Lieutenancy for the City of <HI>London,</HI> on which they had &s;et their hearts, much more perhaps than it de&s;erved, was &s;o altered, that the Whigs were the &s;uperior number; and all other Commi&s;&s;ions over <HI>England</HI> were much changed. They were al&s;o brought into many places of Tru&s;t and Profit; So that the King put his affairs chiefly into their hands: Yet &s;o, that no Tory, who had expre&s;&s;ed zeal or affe|ction for the Government, was turned out. Upon this, the Whigs expre&s;t new zeal, and confidence in the King. All the Money that was asked, for the next Year's expence, was granted very readily.</P>
<P>Among other Funds that were created, One was for con&s;ti|tuting a Bank, which occa&s;ioned great debates: Some thought <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Bank erected.</NOTE> a Bank would grow to be a Monopoly. All the Money of <HI>England</HI> would come into their hands; And they would in a few years become the Ma&s;ters of the Stock and Wealth of the Nation. Others argued for it: That the credit it would have, mu&s;t increa&s;e Trade and the circulation of Money, at lea&s;t in Bank Notes. It was vi&s;ible, that all the Enemies of the Go|vernment &s;et them&s;elves again&s;t it, with &s;uch a vehemence of zeal, that this alone convinced all people, that they &s;aw the &s;trength that our affairs would receive from it. I had heard the <HI>Dutch</HI> often reckon up the great advantages they had from their Banks; And they concluded that, as long as <HI>England</HI> con|tinued jealous of the Government, a Bank could never be &s;ettled among us, nor gain credit enough to &s;upport it&s;elf: And upon that, they judged that the &s;uperiority in Trade mu&s;t &s;till lie on their &s;ide. This, with all the other remote Funds that were created, had another good effect: It engaged all tho&s;e, who were concerned in them, to be, upon the account of their own Intere&s;t, zealous for maintaining the Government; &s;ince it was not to be doubted, but that a Revolution would have &s;wept all the&s;e away. The advantages that the King, and all concerned in Tallies, had from the Bank, were &s;oon &s;o &s;en&s;ibly felt, that all people &s;aw into the &s;ecret rea&s;ons, that made the Enemies of
<PB N="125" REF="146">
the Con&s;titution &s;et them&s;elves with &s;o much earne&s;tne&s;s again&s;t it.</P>
<P>The enquiry into the conduct at Sea, particularly, with re|lation <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Con|duct of the Fleet exa|mined.</NOTE> to the <HI>Smirna</HI> Fleet, took up much time, and held long: Great exceptions were taken to the many delays; by which it &s;eemed a train was laid, that they &s;hould not get out of our Ports, till the <HI>French</HI> were ready to lie in their way, and inter|cept them; Our want of Intelligence was much complained of: The In&s;tructions that the Admirals, who commanded the Fleet, had received from the Cabinet Council, were thought ill given, and yet wor&s;e executed; Their Orders &s;eem'd weakly drawn, ambiguous, and defective: Nor had they &s;hewed any zeal in doing more, than &s;trictly to obey &s;uch orders: They had very cautiou&s;ly kept within them, and had been very careful never to exceed them in a tittle: They had u&s;ed no diligence to get certain information, concerning the <HI>French</HI> Fleet, whether it was &s;till in <HI>Bre&s;t,</HI> or had &s;ailed out; But in that important matter, they had tru&s;ted general and uncertain reports too ea&s;ily: Nor had they &s;ailed with <HI>Rook,</HI> till he was pa&s;t danger. To all this their an&s;wer was, that they had ob&s;erved their Or|ders; They had rea&s;on to think, the <HI>French</HI> were &s;till in <HI>Bre&s;t;</HI> that therefore it was not &s;afe to &s;ail too far from the Coa&s;t of <HI>England,</HI> when they had (as they under&s;tood) ground to be|lieve, that they had left behind them a great Naval force, which might make an impre&s;&s;ion on our Coa&s;t, when they were at too great a di&s;tance from it; The getting certain Intelligence from <HI>Bre&s;t,</HI> was repre&s;ented as impracticable. They had many &s;pe|cious things to &s;ay in their own defence, and many friends to &s;upport them; For it was now the bu&s;ine&s;s of one party to ac|cu&s;e, and of another to ju&s;tifie that conduct. In conclu&s;ion, there was not ground &s;ufficient to condemn the Admirals; as they had followed their In&s;tructions: So a Vote pa&s;&s;ed in their favour. The re&s;t of the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Se&s;&s;ion was managed both with dexterity and &s;ucce&s;s: All ended well, tho' a little too late: for the Se&s;&s;ion was not fini&s;hed before the end of <HI>April.</HI> Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Baden</HI> came this Winter to concert mea&s;ures with the King: He &s;tayed above two Months in <HI>England,</HI> and was treated with very &s;ingular re&s;pects, and at a great expence.</P>
<P>The Tories began in this Se&s;&s;ion, to ob&s;truct the King's Mea|&s;ures <NOTE PLACE="marg">1694 The Go|vernment mi&s;repre|&s;ented.</NOTE> more openly than before; The Earls of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Not|tingham</HI> did it in the Hou&s;e of Lords, with a peculiar edge and violence: They &s;aw how great a reputation, the fair Admini|&s;tration of Ju&s;tice by the Judges, and more particularly that
<PB N="126" REF="147">
Equity, which appeared in the whole proceedings of the Court of Chancery, gave the Government; therefore they took all occa&s;ions, that gave them any handle to reflect on the&s;e. We had many &s;ad declamations, &s;etting forth the Mi&s;ery the Nation was under, in &s;o tragical a &s;train, that tho&s;e who thought it was quite otherwi&s;e with us, and that under all our taxes and lo&s;&s;es, there was a vi&s;ible encrea&s;e of the Wealth of the Nation, could not hear all this without &s;ome Indignation.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hops had their &s;hare of ill humour vented again&s;t them; It was vi&s;ible to the whole Nation, that there was ano|ther <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bi&s;hops are heavily charged.</NOTE> face of &s;trictne&s;s, of humility and charity among them, than had been ordinarily ob&s;erved before: They vi&s;ited their Dioce&s;es more; They confirmed and preached oftner, than any who had in our memory gone before them; They took more care in examining tho&s;e whom they Ordained, and in looking into the behaviour of their Clergy, than had been formerly practi&s;ed; But they were faithful to the Government, and zea|lous for it; They were gentle to the Di&s;&s;enters, and did not rail at them, nor &s;eem unea&s;y at the Toleration. This was thought &s;uch a heinous matter, that all their other diligence was de|&s;pi&s;ed; And they were repre&s;ented as men, who de&s;igned to un|dermine the Church, and to betray it.</P>
<P>Of this, I will give one In&s;tance; The matter was of great <NOTE PLACE="marg">Debates concerning Divorce.</NOTE> importance; and it occa&s;ioned great and long Debates in this, and in the former Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament: It related to the Duke of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> who had proved his Wife guilty of Adultery, and did move for an Act of Parliament, di&s;&s;olving his Marriage, and allowing him to marry again: In the later Ages of Popery, when Marriage was reckoned among the Sacraments, an opinion grew to be received, that Adultery did not break the Bond, and that it could only entitle to a &s;eparation, but not &s;uch a di&s;|&s;olution of the Marriage, as gave the party, that was injured, a right to marry again: This became the Rule of the Spiritual Courts; tho' there was no Definition made about it, before the Council of <HI>Trent.</HI> At the time of the Reformation, a &s;uit of this nature was pro&s;ecuted by the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Northampton:</HI> The Marriage was di&s;&s;olved, and he married a &s;econd time; But he found it nece&s;&s;ary to move for an Act of Parliament, to confirm this &s;ub&s;equent Marriage: In the Reformation of the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Laws, that was prepared by <HI>Cranmer</HI> and others, in King <HI>Edward</HI>'s time, a Rule was laid down, allowing of a &s;econd Marriage, upon a Divorce for Adultery. This matter had lai$ a&s;leep above an hundred years, till the pre&s;ent Duke of <HI>Rutland,</HI> then Lord <HI>Roos,</HI> moved for the like liberty. At that
<PB N="127" REF="148">
time a &s;ceptical and libertine &s;pirit prevailed, &s;o that &s;ome began to treat Marriage, only as a Civil Contract, in which the Parlia|ment was at full liberty, to make what Laws they plea&s;ed; And mo&s;t of King <HI>Charles</HI>'s Courtiers applauded this, hoping by this doctrine, that the King might be divorced from the Queen. The greater part of the Bi&s;hops, apprehending the con&s;equence that Lord <HI>Roos</HI>'s Act might have, oppo&s;ed every &s;tep that was made in it; tho' many of them were per&s;uaded, that in the ca&s;e of Adultery, when it was fully proved, a &s;econd Marriage might be allowed. In the Duke of <HI>Norfolk</HI>'s ca&s;e, as the Lady was a Papi&s;t, and a bu&s;y Jacobite, &s;o a great Party appeared for her. All that favoured the Jacobites, and tho&s;e who were thought engaged in lewd Practices, e&s;pou&s;ed her concern with a zeal that did them&s;elves little honour. Their number was &s;uch, that no progre&s;s could be made in the Bill, though the proofs were but too full, and too plain. But the main que&s;tion was, whether, &s;uppo&s;ing the matter fully proved, the Duke of <HI>Norfolk</HI> &s;hould be allowed a &s;econd Marriage: The Bi&s;hops were de&s;ired to deliver their opinions, with their rea|&s;ons: All tho&s;e, who had been made during the pre&s;ent Reign, were of opinion, that a &s;econd Marriage in that ca&s;e was law|ful, and conformable, both to the Words of the Go&s;pel, and to the Doctrine of the Primitive Church; and that the contrary opinion was &s;tarted in the late and dark Ages: But all the Bi|&s;hops, that had been made by the two former Kings, were of another opinion; tho' &s;ome of them could not well tell why they were &s;o. Here was a colour for men, who looked at things &s;uperficially, to ob&s;erve that there was a difference of opinion, between the la&s;t made Bi&s;hops, and tho&s;e of an elder &s;tanding: from which they inferred, that we were departing from the received Doctrine of our Church; and upon that topick, the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> charged us very vehemently. The Bill was let fall at this time; Nor was the Di&s;pute kept up, for no Books were writ on the &s;ubject of either &s;ide.</P>
<P>The King went beyond Sea in <HI>May;</HI> And the Campaign was <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Com|paign in <HI>Flanders.</HI></NOTE> opened &s;oon after: The Armies of both &s;ides came very near one another: The King commanded that of the Confederates, as the Dauphin did the <HI>French:</HI> They lay between <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> and <HI>Leige;</HI> And it was given out, that they intended to be|&s;iege <HI>Ma&s;tricht;</HI> The King moved toward <HI>Na$span$r,</HI> that he might either cut off their provi&s;ions, or force them to &s;ight; But they were re&s;olved to avoid a Battle: So they retired like|wi&s;e, and the Campaign pa&s;t over in the ordinary manner; both of them moving, and watching one another. The King

&s;ent a great Detachment to break into the <HI>French</HI> Countrey at <HI>Pont E&s;peries:</HI> But tho' the Body he &s;ent had made a great ad|vance, before the <HI>French</HI> knew any thing of their march, yet they &s;ent away their Cavalry with &s;o much ha&s;t, and in &s;o con|tinued a march, that they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Pa&s;s before the Body, the King had &s;ent, could reach it; whereby they gained their point, tho' their Cavalry &s;uffered much. This de&s;ign failing, the King &s;ent another Body towards <HI>Huy,</HI> who took it in a few days: It was become more nece&s;&s;ary to do this, for the covering of <HI>Liege,</HI> which was now much broken into faction; Their Bi&s;hop was dead, and there was a great divi&s;ion in the Chapter: Some were for the Elector of <HI>Cologne,</HI> and others were for the Elector <HI>Palatine</HI>'s Brother: But that for the Elector of <HI>Cologne</HI> was the &s;tronger party, and the Court of <HI>Rome</HI> judged in their favour. The differences between that Court, and that of <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> were now &s;o far made up, that the Bulls for the Bi&s;hops, whom the King had named to the vacant Sees, were granted, upon the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of all tho&s;e, who had been con|cerned in the Articles of 1682. Yet after all that Reconciliation, the real Inclinations of the Court of <HI>Rome</HI> lay &s;till towards the Confederates: The Alliance that <HI>France</HI> was in with the Turk, was a thing of an odious &s;ound at <HI>Rome.</HI> The taking of <HI>Huy</HI> cover|ed <HI>Liege;</HI> So that they were both &s;afer and quieter. The Confe|derates, e&s;pecially the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and the <HI>Dutch,</HI> grew weary of keep|ing up va&s;t Armies, that did nothing el&s;e, but lay for &s;ome Months advantageou&s;ly po&s;ted, in view of the Enemy, without any Action.</P>
<P>On the <HI>Rhine,</HI> things went much in the u&s;ual manner; only at the end of the Campaign, the Prince of <HI>Baden</HI> pa&s;&s;ed the <NOTE PLACE="marg">On the <HI>Rhine.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Rhine,</HI> and rai&s;ed great Contributions in <HI>Al&s;ace,</HI> which the <HI>French</HI> &s;uffered him to do, rather than hazard a Battle. There was nothing of any importance done on either &s;ide in <HI>Pied|mont;</HI> Only there appeared to be &s;ome &s;ecret management be|tween the Court of <HI>France,</HI> and that of <HI>Turin,</HI> in order to a Peace: It was chiefly negotiated at <HI>Rome,</HI> but was all the while denied by the Duke of <HI>Savoy.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Catalonia,</HI> the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were beat off from &s;ome Po&s;ts, <NOTE PLACE="marg">And in <HI>Catalonia.</HI></NOTE> and <HI>Gironne</HI> was taken; nor was <HI>Barcelona</HI> in any condition to have re&s;i&s;ted, if the <HI>French</HI> had &s;et down before it. The Court of <HI>Madrid</HI> felt their weakne&s;s, and &s;aw their danger &s;o vi&s;ibly, that they were forced to implore the Protection of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet: The <HI>French</HI> had carried the be&s;t part of their Naval Force into the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> and had re&s;olved to attack <HI>Barcelona,</HI> both by Sea and Land, at the &s;ame time: And, upon their &s;ucce&s;s there, to have gone round <HI>Spain,</HI> de&s;troying their Coa&s;t every
<PB N="129" REF="150">
where. All this was intended to force them to accept the offers the <HI>French</HI> were willing to make them; But to prevent this, <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> was ordered to &s;ail into the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> with a Fleet of three&s;core great Ships: He was &s;o long &s;topt in his Voyage by contrary Winds, that the <HI>French,</HI> if they had pur&s;ued their advantages, might have fini&s;hed the Conque&s;t of <HI>Catalonia;</HI> But they re&s;olved not to hazard their Fleet; So it was brought back to <HI>Toulon,</HI> long before <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> could get into the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> which was now left entirely to him. But it was thought, that the <HI>French</HI> intended to make a &s;econd Attempt, in the end of the year, a&s;&s;oon as he &s;hould &s;ail back to <HI>England:</HI> So it was propo&s;ed, that he might lie at <HI>Cadiz</HI> all the winter. This was an affair of that importance, that it was long and much de|bated, before it was re&s;olved on. It was thought a dangerous thing, to expo&s;e the be&s;t part of our Fleet, &s;o much as it mu&s;t <NOTE PLACE="marg">Our Fleet lay at <HI>Ca|diz.</HI></NOTE> be, while it lay at &s;o great a di&s;tance from us, that Convoys of Stores and Provi&s;ions might ea&s;ily be intercepted: And indeed, the Ships were &s;o low in their Provi&s;ions, when they came back to <HI>Cadiz</HI> (the Ve&s;&s;els that were ordered to carry them, having been &s;topt four months in the Channel by contrary winds) that our Fleet had not then above a fortnight's Victuals on Board: Yet when the whole matter was thoroughly canva&s;t, it was agreed, that our Ships might both lie &s;afe, and be well careened at <HI>Cadiz;</HI> Nor was the difference in the expence, be|tween their lying there, and in our own Ports, con&s;iderable. By our lying there, the <HI>French</HI> were &s;hut within the <HI>Mediter|ranean;</HI> &s;o that the Ocean and their Coa&s;ts were left open to us. They were in effect &s;hut up within <HI>Toulon;</HI> for they, having no other Port in tho&s;e Seas but that, re&s;olved not to venture abroad; So that now we were Ma&s;ters of the Seas every where. The&s;e con&s;iderations, determined the King to &s;end Orders to <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> to lie all the winter at <HI>Cadiz;</HI> which produced very good ef|fects; The <HI>Venetians</HI> and the <HI>Great Duke</HI> had not thought fit to own the King till then: A great Fleet of Stores and Am|munition, with all other provi&s;ions for the next Campaign, came &s;afe to <HI>Cadiz:</HI> and &s;ome clean Men of War were &s;ent out, in exchange for others, which were ordered home.</P>
<P>But while we were very fortunate in our main Fleet, we had not the like good &s;ucce&s;s, in an attempt that was made <NOTE PLACE="marg">A de&s;ign on <HI>Camar$t.</HI></NOTE> on <HI>Camaret,</HI> a &s;mall neck of Land that lies in the mouth of the River of <HI>Bre&s;t,</HI> and would have commanded that River, if we could have made our &s;elves Ma&s;ters of it. <HI>Talma&s;h</HI> had form|ed the de&s;ign of &s;eizing on it; He had taken care to be well informed of every thing relating to it; 6000 Men &s;eemed to
<PB N="130" REF="151">
be more than were nece&s;&s;ary for taking and keeping it: The de&s;ign, and the preparations for it, were kept &s;o &s;ecret, that there was not the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of the Project, till the hiring Tran&s;port Ships di&s;covered it. A propo&s;ition had been made of this two years before to the Earl of <HI>Nottingham;</HI> who, a|mong other things, charged <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> with it, that this had been laid before him, by men that came from thence, but that he had neglected it: Whether the <HI>French</HI> apprehended the de&s;ign from that motion, or whether it was now betrayed to them, by &s;ome of tho&s;e who were in the &s;ecret, I know not: It is cer|tain, that they had &s;uch timely knowledge of it, as put them on their guard. The Preparations were not quite ready, by the day that was &s;ettled: And, when all was ready, they were &s;topt by a we&s;terly wind for &s;ome time: So that they came thither, a month later than was intended. They found the place was well fortified by many Batteries, that were rai&s;ed in diffe|rent Lines upon the Rocks, that lay over the place of De&s;cent: And great numbers were there ready to di&s;pute their landing. When our Fleet came &s;o near as to &s;ee all this, the Council of Officers were all again&s;t making the attempt; But <HI>Talma&s;h</HI> had &s;et his heart &s;o much upon it, that he could not be di|verted from it:</P>
<P>He fancied, the men they &s;aw were only a Rabble brought <NOTE PLACE="marg">It mi&s;car|ried.</NOTE> together to make a &s;how, tho' it appeared very evidently, that there were regular bodies among them, and that their numbers were double to his. He began with a landing of &s;ix hundred men, and put him&s;elf at the head of them; the men followed him with great courage; But they were &s;o expo&s;ed to the Enemies $span$e, and could do them &s;o little harm, that it quickly appear|ed, it was needle&s;ly throwing away the lives of brave men, to per&s;i&s;t longer in &s;o de&s;perate an undertaking. The greate&s;t part of tho&s;e who landed, were killed, or taken pri&s;on|ers; And not above an hundred of them came back. <HI>Tal|ma&s;h</HI> him&s;elf was &s;hot in the thigh, of which he died in a few days, and was much lamented; For he was a brave and ge|nerous man, and a good Officer, very fit to animate and en|courage inferior Officers and Soldiers; But he was much too apt to be di&s;contented, and to turn mutinous; &s;o that upon the whole, he was one of tho&s;e dangerous men, that are capable of doing as much mi&s;chief, as good &s;ervice. Thus that De|&s;ign mi&s;carried, which, if it had been undertaken at any time, before the <HI>French</HI> were &s;o well prepared to receive us, might have &s;ucceeded; And mu&s;t have had great effects.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="152">
Our Fleet came back to <HI>Plymouth;</HI> and after they had &s;et the Land Forces a&s;hore, being well furni&s;hed with Bomb-ve&s;&s;els and Ammunition, they were ordered to try what could be done on <NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>French</HI> Coa$ bom|barded.</NOTE> the <HI>French</HI> Coa&s;t; They lay fir&s;t before <HI>Dieppe,</HI> and burnt it almo&s;t entirely to the ground; They went next to <HI>Havre de Grace,</HI> and de&s;troyed a great part of that Town: <HI>Dunkirk</HI> was the place of the greate&s;t Importance: So that attempt was long pur&s;ued in &s;everal ways; But none of them &s;ucceeded. The&s;e Bombardings of the <HI>French</HI> Towns &s;oon &s;pread a Terror, a|mong all that lived near the Coa&s;t; Batteries were every where rai&s;ed, and the people were brought out to defend their Coun|try; But they could do us no hurt, while our Bombs at a mile's di&s;tance did great execution: The action &s;eemed inhu|man; But the <HI>French,</HI> who had bombarded <HI>Genoa,</HI> without a previous Declaration of War, and who had &s;o often put whole Countries under Military Execution, even after they had paid the Contributions, that had been laid on them (for which they had protection given them) had no rea&s;on to complain of this way of carrying on the War, which they them&s;elves had fir&s;t begun.</P>
<P>The Campaign ended every where, to the advantage of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in <HI>Turky.</HI></NOTE> Confederates, tho' no &s;ignal &s;ucce&s;&s;es had happened to their Arms; And this new &s;cene of action at Sea rai&s;ed the hearts of our people, as much as it &s;unk our Enemies. The War in <HI>Turky,</HI> went on this year with various &s;ucce&s;s: The <HI>Venctians</HI> made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the I&s;le of <HI>Scio,</HI> the riche&s;t and the be&s;t peopled of all the I&s;lands in the <HI>Archipelago:</HI> Tho&s;e of that I&s;land had a greater &s;hare of liberty left them, than any Subjects of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire; and they flouri&s;hed accord|ingly: The great Trade of <HI>Smirna,</HI> that lay &s;o near them, made them the more con&s;iderable: The <HI>Venetians</HI> fortified the Port, but u&s;ed the Natives wor&s;e than the <HI>Turks</HI> had done: And as the I&s;land had a greater number of People upon it, than could &s;ub&s;i&s;t by the productions within them&s;elves, and the <HI>Turks</HI> prohibited all Commerce with them from <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> from whence they had their Bread; the <HI>Venetians</HI> could not keep this Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, unle&s;s they had carried off the greate&s;t part of the In|habitants to the <HI>Morea,</HI> or their other Dominions, that wanted People. The <HI>Turks</HI> brought their whole power at Sea toge|ther, to make an attempt for recovering this I&s;land: Two Ac|tions happened at Sea, within ten days one of another; In the la&s;t of which, the <HI>Venetians</HI> pretended they had got a great Vic|tory: But their abandoning <HI>Scio,</HI> in a few days after, &s;hewed that they did not find it convenient to hold that I&s;land, which
<PB N="132" REF="153">
obliged them to keep a Fleet, at &s;uch a di&s;tance from their other Dominions, and at a charge, which the keeping the I&s;land could not ballance. The <HI>Turks</HI> &s;ent, as they did every year, a great Convoy to <HI>Caminieck,</HI> guarded by the <HI>Crim-Tartars:</HI> The <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Army routed the Convoy, and became Ma&s;ters of all the Provi&s;ions; But a &s;econd Convoy was more happy, and got into the place; Otherwi&s;e it mu&s;t have been abandoned. There was great di&s;traction in the Affairs of <HI>Poland:</HI> Their Queen's intrigues with the Court of <HI>France,</HI> gave much jealou|&s;y; Their Diets were broke up in confu&s;ion; And they could never agree &s;o far in the Preliminaries, as to be able by their forms to do any bu&s;ine&s;s. In <HI>Tran&s;ilvania,</HI> the Emperor had, after a long Blockade, forced <HI>Giula</HI> to &s;urrender; So that the <HI>Turks</HI> had now nothing in tho&s;e parts, on the North of the <HI>Danube,</HI> but <HI>Teme&s;waer.</HI> The Grand <HI>Vizier</HI> came into <HI>Hun|gary</HI> with a great Army, while the Emperor had a very &s;mall one to oppo&s;e him. If the <HI>Turks</HI> had come on re&s;olutely, and if the weather had continued good, it might have brought a fatal rever&s;e on all the Imperial affairs, and retrieved all that the <HI>Turks</HI> had lo&s;t. But the Grand <HI>Vizier</HI> lay &s;till, while the Em|peror's Army encrea&s;ed, and &s;uch rains fell, that nothing could be done. The affairs of <HI>Turky</HI> were thus in great di&s;order: The Grand Seignior died &s;oon after: And his Succe&s;&s;or in that Empire gave his Subjects &s;uch hopes of Peace, that they were calmed for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>At the end of the Campaign, the Court of <HI>France</HI> flattered <NOTE PLACE="marg">Attempts for $word$ $word$.</NOTE> their People with hopes of a &s;peedy end of the War: And &s;ome men of great con&s;ideration were &s;ent to try, what terms they could bring the Empire or the States to: But the <HI>French</HI> were yet far from offering conditions, upon which a ju&s;t or a &s;afe Peace could be treated of: The <HI>States</HI> &s;ent &s;ome, as far as to <HI>Ma&s;tricht,</HI> to &s;ee what Powers, tho&s;e &s;ent from <HI>France,</HI> had brought with them; before they would grant them the Pa&s;&s;|ports, that they de&s;ired: And when they &s;aw how limited the&s;e were, the Negotiation was &s;oon at an end; or rather, it never began. When the <HI>French</HI> &s;aw this, they di&s;owned their hav|ing &s;ent any on &s;uch an errand; And pretended, that this was only an artifice of the Confederates, to keep one another and their people in heart, by making them believe, that they had now only a &s;mall remnant of the War before them, &s;ince the <HI>French</HI> had In&s;truments, every where at work, to &s;ollicit a Peace.</P>
<P>The King came to <HI>England</HI> in the beginning of <HI>November;</HI> And the Parliament was opened with a calmer face, than had <NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ $word$ of $line$.</NOTE> appeared in any Se&s;&s;ion during this Reign: The Supplies that
<PB N="133" REF="154">
were demanded, the total amounting to five Millions, were all granted readily: An ill humour indeed appeared in &s;ome, who oppo&s;ed the Funds, that would mo&s;t ea&s;ily and mo&s;t certainly rai&s;e the money that was given, upon this pretence, that &s;uch Taxes would grow to be a general Exci&s;e; and that the more ea&s;ily money was rai&s;ed, it would be the more ea&s;y to continue &s;uch Duties to a longer period, if not for ever; the truth was, the &s;ecret Enemies of the Government propo&s;ed &s;uch Funds, as would be the heavie&s;t to the people, and would not fully an|&s;wer what they were e&s;timated at; that &s;o the Nation might be unea&s;y under that load, and that a con&s;tant Deficiency might bring on &s;uch a Debt, that the Government could not di&s;|charge, but mu&s;t &s;ink under it.</P>
<P>With the Supply Bills, as the price or bargain for them, the <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Act for frequent Parliaments.</NOTE> Bill for frequent Parliaments went on; It enacted, that a new Parliament &s;hould be called every third year, and that the pre|&s;ent Parliament &s;hould be di&s;&s;olved before the <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> of <HI>January</HI> 1695-6; And to this, the Royal A&s;&s;ent was given: It was re|ceived with great Joy, many fancying that all their other Laws and Liberties were now the more &s;ecure, &s;ince this was pa&s;&s;ed into a Law. Time mu&s;t tell what effects it will produce; whe|ther it will put an end to the great Corruption, with which Elections were formerly managed, and to all tho&s;e other prac|tices that accompanied them. Men that intended to &s;ell their own Votes within doors, &s;pared no co&s;t to buy the Votes of others in Elections: But now it was hoped we &s;hould &s;ee a Golden Age, wherein the character men were in, and reputation they had, would be the prevailing con&s;iderations in Elections: And by this means it was hoped, that our Con&s;titution, in particular that part of it, which related to the Hou&s;e of Commons, would again recover both its &s;trength and reputation; which was now very much &s;unk; for Corruption was &s;o generally &s;pread, that it was believed every thing was carried by that method.</P>

His di&s;temper did &s;o op|pre&s;s him, and &s;peaking was &s;o unea&s;y to him, that tho' it ap|peared, by &s;igns and other indications, that his Under&s;tanding remained long clear, yet he was not able to expre&s;s him&s;elf, &s;o as to edify others. He &s;eemed &s;till &s;erene and calm; And in broken words he &s;aid, He thanked God, he was quiet within, and had nothing then to do, but to wait for the Will of Hea|ven. I preached his Funeral Sermon, in which I gave a Cha|racter of him, which was &s;o &s;everely true, that I perhaps kept too much within bounds, and &s;aid le&s;s than he de&s;erved. But we
<PB N="135" REF="156">
had lived in &s;uch friend&s;hip together, that I thought it was more decent, as it always is more &s;afe, to err on that hand: He was the man of the true&s;t judgment, and be&s;t temper, I had ever known: He had a clear head, with a mo&s;t tender and com|pa&s;&s;ionate heart; He was a faithful and zealous friend, but a gentle and &s;oon conquered enemy; He was truly and &s;eriou&s;ly religious, but without affectation, bigottry, or &s;uper&s;tition; His notions of Morality were fine and &s;ublime; His thread of Rea&s;oning, was ea&s;y, clear, and &s;olid; He was not only the be&s;t Preacher of the age, but &s;eemed to have brought Preaching to perfection; His Sermons were &s;o well heard and liked, and &s;o much read, that all the Nation propo&s;ed him as a Pattern, and &s;tudied to copy after him; His parts re|mained with him clear and unclouded; But the perpetual Slan|ders, and other ill u&s;age he had been followed with, for many years, mo&s;t particularly &s;ince his advancement to that great Po&s;t, gave him too much trouble, and too deep a concern; It could neither provoke him, nor fright him from his duty; But it affected his mind &s;o much, that this was thought to have &s;hortned his days.</P>
<P><HI>Sancroft</HI> had died a year before, in the &s;ame poor and de&s;|picable <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sancroft</HI>'s Death.</NOTE> manner, in which he had lived for &s;ome years; He died in a &s;tate of Separation from the Church; And yet he had not the courage to own it in any publick declaration: For neither living nor dying, did he publi&s;h any thing concerning it: His Death ought to have put an end to the Schi&s;m, that &s;ome were endeavouring to rai&s;e; upon this pretence, that a Parliamentary Deprivation was never to be allowed, as contrary to the intrin|&s;ick Power of the Church; And therefore they looked on <HI>San|croft</HI> as the Archbi&s;hop &s;till, and reckoned <HI>Tillot&s;on</HI> an U&s;urper; And all that joined with him were counted Schi&s;maticks; They were willing to forget, as &s;ome of them did plainly condemn, the Deprivations made in the progre&s;s of the Reformation, more particularly, tho&s;e in the fir&s;t Parliament of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Reign, and the Deprivations made by the Act of Uniformity in the year 1662: But from thence, the Controver&s;y was carried up to the Fourth Century; And a great deal of angry reading was brought out on both &s;ides, to ju&s;tify, or to condemn tho&s;e pro|ceedings. But arguments will never have the better of intere&s;t and humour; Yet now, even according to their own preten|&s;ions, the Schi&s;m ought to have cea&s;ed; &s;ince he, on who&s;e account it was &s;et up, did never a&s;&s;ert his right; and therefore that might have been more ju&s;tly con&s;trued a tacit yielding it: But tho&s;e who have a mind to embroil Church or State, will

never want a pretence, and no Arguments will beat them from it.</P>
<P>Both King and Queen were much affected with <HI>Tillot&s;on</HI>'s <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Teni&s;on</HI> &s;ucceeded.</NOTE> death: The Queen for many days &s;poke of him, in the tender|e&s;t manner, and not without tears; He died &s;o poor, that if the King had not forgiven his Fir&s;t Fruits, his debts could not have been all payed: So generous and charitable was he in a Po&s;t, out of which <HI>Sancroft</HI> had rai&s;ed a great E&s;tate, which he left to his Family: But <HI>Tillot&s;on</HI> was rich in good works. His See was filled by <HI>Teni&s;on,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Lincoln;</HI> Many wi&s;hed that <HI>Stillingfleet</HI> might have &s;ucceeded, he being not only &s;o eminent|ly learned, but judged a man in all re&s;pects fit for the Po&s;t. The Queen was inclined to him, &s;he &s;poke with &s;ome earne&s;t|ne&s;s, oftner than once, to the Duke of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> on that &s;ubject: She thought, he would fill that Po&s;t with great dig|nity: She al&s;o pre&s;&s;ed the King earne&s;tly for him: But as his ill health made him not capable of the fatigue that belonged to this Province: So the Whigs did generally apprehend, that both his notions and his temper were too high; and all concurred to de&s;ire <HI>Teni&s;on,</HI> who had a firmer health, with a more active temper; and was univer&s;ally well liked, for having &s;erved the Cure of St. <HI>Martin</HI>'s, in the wor&s;t time, with &s;o much courage and di&s;cretion; So that at this time he had many Friends, and no Enemies.</P>
<P>The Small Pox raged this winter about <HI>London;</HI> Some thou|&s;ands dying of them; which gave us great apprehen&s;ions, with relation to the Queen; for &s;he had never had them.</P>
<P>In conclu&s;ion, &s;he was taken ill, but the next day that &s;eem|ed <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen's Sickne&s;s.</NOTE> to go off: I had the honour to be half an hour with her that day: And &s;he complained then of nothing. The day follow|ing, &s;he went abroad; But her illne&s;s returned &s;o heavily on her, that &s;he could di&s;gui&s;e it no longer: She &s;hut her &s;elf up long in her Clo&s;et that night, and burnt many Papers, and put the re&s;t in order: After that, &s;he u&s;ed &s;ome &s;light remedies, think|ing it was only a tran&s;ient indi&s;po&s;ition; But it encrea&s;ed upon her; And within two days after, the Small Pox appeared, and with very bad Symptoms. I will not enter into another's Pro|vince, nor &s;peak of matters &s;o much out of the way of my own Profe&s;&s;ion: But the Phy&s;icians part was univer&s;ally con|demned, and her death was imputed to the negligence or unskilfulne&s;s of Dr. <HI>Ratcliffe.</HI> He was called for; and it ap|pe$$ed, but too evidently, that his Opinion was chiefly con&s;i|dered; and was mo&s;t depended on. Other Phy&s;icians were afterwards called; But not till it was too late. The King was
<PB N="137" REF="158">
&s;truck with this beyond expre&s;&s;ion; He came, on the &s;econd day of her illne&s;s, and pa&s;&s;ed the Bill for frequent Parlia|ments; which if he had not done that day, it is very proba|ble he would never have pa&s;&s;ed it. The day after, he called me into his Clo&s;et, and gave a free vent to a mo&s;t tender pa&s;|&s;ion; He bur&s;t out into tears; and cried out, that there was no hope of the Queen; and that, from being the happie&s;t, he was now going to be the mi&s;erable&s;t creature upon Earth. He &s;aid, during the whole cour&s;e of their Marriage, he had never known one &s;ingle fault in her; There was a worth in her, that no body knew be&s;ides him&s;elf; tho' he added, that I might know as much of her as any other per&s;on did. Ne|ver was &s;uch a face of univer&s;al Sorrow &s;een in a Court, or in a Town, as at this time: All people, men and women, young and old, could &s;carce refrain from Tears: On <HI>Chri&s;t|mas</HI> Day, the Small Pox &s;unk &s;o entirely, and the Queen felt her &s;elf &s;o well upon it, that it was for a while con|cluded &s;he had the Mea&s;les, and that the danger was over. This hope was ill grounded, and of a &s;hort continuance: For before night, all was &s;adly changed. It appeared, that the Small Pox were now &s;o &s;unk, that there was no hope of rai&s;ing them. The new Archbi&s;hop attended on her; He performed all devotions, and had much private di&s;cour&s;e with her: When the de&s;perate condition &s;he was in, was evident beyond doubt, he told the King, He could not do his duty faithfully, unle&s;s he acquainted her with the danger &s;he was in: The King approved of it, and &s;aid, whatever effect it might have, he would not have her deceived in &s;o impor|tant a matter. And, as the Archbi&s;hop was preparing the Queen, with &s;ome addre&s;s, not to &s;urpri&s;e her too much with &s;uch tidings, &s;he pre&s;ently apprehended his drift, but &s;hewed no fear nor di&s;order upon it. She &s;aid, &s;he thanked God &s;he had always carried this in her mind, that nothing was to be left to the la&s;t hour; &s;he had nothing then to do, but to look up to God, and &s;ubmit to his Will; It went further indeed than &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; for &s;he &s;eemed to de&s;ire Death, rather than Life; And &s;he continued to the la&s;t minute of her life in that calm and re&s;igned &s;tate. She had formerly wrote her mind, in many particulars, to the King: And &s;he gave order, to look carefully for a &s;mall Scrutoir that &s;he made u&s;e of, and to deliver it to the King: And, having di&s;patched that, &s;he avoided the giving her &s;elf or him the tenderne&s;s, which a final parting might have rai&s;ed in them both. She was al|mo&s;t perpetually in Prayer; The day before &s;he died, &s;he receiv|ed
<PB N="$$8" REF="159">
the Sacrament, all the Bi&s;hops who were attending, being admitted to receive it with her: We were, God knows, a &s;or|rowful Company; For we were lo&s;ing her, who was our chief $ope and glory on Earth; She followed the whole Office, re|$span$ating it after the Archbi&s;hop; She apprehended, not without $span$e concern, that &s;he &s;hould not be able to &s;wallow the Bread, $word$ it went down ea&s;ily. When this was over, &s;he compo&s;ed her &s;elf &s;olemnly to die; She &s;lumbered &s;ometimes, but &s;aid, &s;he was not refre&s;hed by it; and &s;aid often, that nothing did her good but Prayer; She tried once or twice to have &s;aid &s;omewhat to the King, but was not able to go through with it. She ordered the Archbi&s;hop to be reading to her &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture, as might fix her Attention, and rai&s;e her Devotion: Several Cordials were given, but all was ineffectual; She lay &s;ilent for &s;ome hours: And &s;ome words that came from her, &s;hewed her thoughts began to break: In conclu&s;ion, &s;he died on the <HI>28th</HI> of <HI>December,</HI> about One in the Morning, in <NOTE PLACE="marg">And Death.</NOTE> the Thirty third year of her Age, and in the Sixth of her Reign.</P>
<P>She was the mo&s;t univer&s;ally lamented Prince&s;s, and de&s;erved the be&s;t to be &s;o, of any in our Age, or in our Hi&s;tory. I will add no more concerning her, in the way of a Character: I have &s;aid a great deal already in this work; And I wrote a Book, as an E&s;&s;ay on her Character, in which I have &s;aid nothing, but that which I knew to be &s;trictly true, without the enlarge|ment of Figure or Rhetorick. The King's affliction for her Death was as great as it was ju&s;t; It was greater than tho&s;e who knew him be&s;t, thought his temper capable of: He went beyond all bounds in it; During her Sickne&s;s, he was in an Agony, that amazed us all, fainting often, and breaking out into mo&s;t violent Lamentations; When &s;he died, his Spirits &s;unk &s;o low, that there was great rea&s;on to apprehend, that he was follow|ing her; For &s;ome Weeks after, he was &s;o little Ma&s;ter of him|&s;elf, that he was not capable of minding bu&s;ine&s;s, or of &s;eeing Company. He turned him&s;elf much to the Meditations of Religion, and to &s;ecret Prayer; The Archbi&s;hop was often and long with him; He entred upon &s;olemn and &s;erious re&s;olu|tions of becoming, in all things, an exact, and an exemplary Chri&s;tian. And now I am come to the Period of this Book, with a very melancholy Pro&s;pect: But God has ordered mat|ters &s;ince, beyond all our expectations.</P>

<P>_THE Two Hou&s;es of Parliament &s;et an Example, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1695</NOTE> that was followed by the whole Nation, of mak|ing con&s;olatory and dutiful Addre&s;&s;es to the King. <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pro|ceeding in Parliament.</NOTE> The Queen was buried with the ordinary Ceremo|ny, and with one piece of Magnificence that could never happen before; for both Hou&s;es of Parliament went in Proce&s;&s;ion before the Chariot, that carried her Body to <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter</HI> Abbey; where places were prepared for both Hou&s;es, to &s;it in form, while the Archbi&s;hop preached the Funeral Ser|mon. This could never happen before, &s;ince the Sovereign's
<PB N="140" REF="161">
Death had always di&s;&s;olved our Parliaments: It is true, the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> tried, if he could have rai&s;ed a doubt of the Lega|lity of this Parliament's continuance, &s;ince it was &s;ummoned by King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary;</HI> So upon her death, the writ, that ran in her name, &s;eemed to die with her: This would have had fatal Con&s;equences, if in that &s;ea&s;on of the year, all things mu&s;t have &s;tood &s;till, till a new Parliament could have been brought together: But the Act, that put the Admini&s;tration en|tirely in the King, tho' the Queen had a &s;hare in the dignity of Sovereign, made this cavil appear to be &s;o ill-grounded, that no body &s;econded &s;o dangerous a &s;ugge&s;tion.</P>
<P>The Parliament went on with the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Nation; <NOTE PLACE="marg">The ill &s;tate of the Coin.</NOTE> In which the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> and that Party, artfully &s;tudied, all that was po&s;&s;ible, to embroil our affairs: The &s;tate of our Coin gave then too great a handle for it. We had two &s;orts of Coin, The one was milled, and could not be practi&s;ed on: But the other was not &s;o, and was &s;ubject to clipping; And in a cour&s;e of &s;ome years, the old money was every year &s;o much dimini&s;hed, that it at la&s;t grew to be le&s;s than the half of the intrin&s;ick value; Tho&s;e who drove this Trade, were as much enriched, as the Nation &s;uffered by it: When it came to be generally ob&s;erved, the King was advi&s;ed to i&s;&s;ue out a Pro|clamation, that no money &s;hould pa&s;s for the future, by the tale, but by the weight, which would put a pre&s;ent end to clip|ping. But <HI>Seimour,</HI> being then in the Trea&s;ury, oppo&s;ed this; He advi&s;ed the King to look on, and let that matter have its cour&s;e: The Parliament would in due time take care of it; But in the mean while, the badne&s;s of money quickned the Cir|culation, while every one &s;tudied to put out of his hands all the bad money; And this would make all people the readier to bring their ca&s;h into the Exchequer; And &s;o a Loan was more ea&s;ily made. The badne&s;s of the money began now to grow very vi&s;ible; It was plain, that no remedy could be provided for it, but by recoining all the Specie of <HI>England;</HI> And that could not be &s;et about, in the end of a Se&s;&s;ion. The Earls of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Nottingham</HI> repre&s;ented this very tragically in the Hou&s;e of Lords, where it was not po&s;&s;ible to give the proper remedy; It produced only an Act, with &s;tricter clau&s;es and &s;e|verer penalties again&s;t Clippers; This had no other effect, but that it alarmed the Nation, and &s;unk the value of our money in the Exchange; Guineas, which were equal in value to twenty one Shillings and Six-pence in Silver, ro&s;e to thirty Shillings, that is to &s;ay, thirty Shillings &s;unk to twenty one Shillings and Six|pence. This publick di&s;grace, put on our Coin, when the evil
<PB N="141" REF="162">
was not cured, was in effect a great point carried, by which there was an opportunity given to &s;ink the credit of the Govern|ment, and of the publick Funds; And it brought a di&s;count of above <HI>40l. per Cent.</HI> upon Tallies.</P>
<P>Another Bill was &s;et on foot, which was long pur&s;ued, and, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Bill con|cerning Tri|als for Trea|&s;on.</NOTE> in conclu&s;ion, carried by the Tories: It was concerning Trials for Trea&s;on; And the de&s;ign of it &s;eemed to be, to make men as &s;afe in all trea&s;onable Con&s;piracies and Practices, as was po&s;|&s;ible: Two Witne&s;&s;es were to concur to prove the &s;ame Fact, at the &s;ame time: Council in matters of Fact, and Witne&s;&s;es upon Oath, were by it allowed to the Pri&s;oners; They were to have a Copy of the Indictment, and the Pannel in due time: All the&s;e things were in them&s;elves ju&s;t and rea&s;onable: And if they had been moved by other men, and at another time, they would have met with little oppo&s;ition: They were chiefly &s;et on by <HI>Finch,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI>'s Brother, who had been con|cerned in the hard pro&s;ecutions for Trea&s;ons in the end of King <HI>Charles</HI>'s Reign, and had then carried all Prerogative points very far; but was during this Reign, in a con&s;tant oppo&s;ition to every thing, that was propo&s;ed for the King's Service: He had a copious way of &s;peaking, with an appearance of Beau|ty and Eloquence to vulgar Hearers: But there was a &s;uper|ficialne&s;s in mo&s;t of his harangues, that made them &s;eem tedious to better Judges; His Rhetorick was all vicious, and his Rea&s;oning was too &s;ubtle. The occa&s;ion given for this Bill, leads me to give an account of &s;ome Trials for Trea&s;on, during the la&s;t har|ve&s;t, which, for the relation they have to this matter, I have re&s;erved for this place.</P>
<P><HI>Lunt</HI> an <HI>Iri&s;hman,</HI> who was bold and poor, and of a mean <NOTE PLACE="marg">Trials in <HI>Lanca&s;hire.</HI></NOTE> under&s;tanding, had been often employed to carry Letters and Me&s;&s;ages between <HI>Ireland</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> when King <HI>James</HI> was there. He was once taken up on &s;u&s;picion, but he was faithful to his Party, and would di&s;cover nothing; So he continued after that to be tru&s;ted by them. But, being kept very poor, he grew weary of his low e&s;tate, and thought of gaining the re|wards of a di&s;covery. He fell into the hands of one <HI>Taff,</HI> an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Prie&s;t, who had not only changed his Religion, but had married in King <HI>James</HI>'s time. <HI>Taff</HI> came into the &s;ervice of the pre&s;ent Government, and had a &s;mall pen&s;ion. He was long in pur&s;uit of a di&s;covery of the Impo&s;ture in the Birth of the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and was engaged with more &s;ucce&s;s in di&s;co|vering the concealed E&s;tates of the Prie&s;ts, and the Religious Orders, in which &s;ome progre&s;s was made. The&s;e &s;eemed to be &s;ure evidences of the &s;incerity of the man, at lea&s;t in his oppo|&s;ition

to tho&s;e, whom he had for&s;aken, and whom he was pro|voking in &s;o &s;en&s;ible a manner. All this I mention, the more particularly, to &s;hew how little that &s;ort of men is to be depend|ed on; He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed tho&s;e, to whom his other di&s;coveries gave him acce&s;s, of the importance of this <HI>Lunt,</HI> who was then come from St. <HI>Germains,</HI> and who could make great di&s;coveries: So <HI>Lunt</HI> was examined by the Mini&s;ters of State; And he gave them an account of &s;ome di&s;cour&s;es and de&s;igns again&s;t the King, and of an In&s;urrection, that was to have broke out in the year 1692, when King <HI>James</HI> was de&s;igning to come over from <HI>Normandy;</HI> for, he &s;aid, he had carried at that time Commi&s;|&s;ions to the chief men of the party, both in <HI>Lanca&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Che&s;hire.</HI> A Carrier had been employed to carry down great quantities of Arms to them: One of the Che&s;ts, in which they were put up, had broke in the carriage, &s;o the Carrier &s;aw what was in them; And he depo&s;ed, he had carried many of the &s;ame weight and &s;ize; The per&s;ons concerned, finding the Carrier was true and &s;ecret, continued to employ him in that &s;ort of carriage for a great while. <HI>Lunt</HI>'s &s;tory &s;eemed probable and coherent in all its circum&s;tances: So orders were &s;ent to &s;eize on &s;ome per&s;ons, and to &s;earch hou&s;es for Arms. In one hou&s;e they found Arms for a Troop of Hor&s;e, built up within walls, very dexterou&s;ly. <HI>Taff</HI> was all this while very zealous in &s;upporting <HI>Lunt</HI>'s credit, and in a&s;&s;i&s;ting him in his di&s;coveries; A &s;olemn Trial of the Pri&s;oners was ordered in <HI>Lanca&s;hire.</HI> When the &s;et time drew near, <HI>Taff</HI> &s;ent them word, that, if he &s;hould be well paid for it, he would bring them all off; It may be ea&s;ily imagined that they &s;tuck at nothing for &s;uch a &s;ervice; He had got out of <HI>Lunt</HI> all his depo&s;itions, which he di&s;clo&s;ed to them; So they had the advantage of being well prepared to meet, and overthrow his evidence in many cir|cum&s;tances: And at the Trial, <HI>Taff</HI> turned again&s;t him, and witne&s;&s;ed many things again&s;t <HI>Lunt,</HI> that &s;hook his credit. There was another Witne&s;s that &s;upported <HI>Lunt</HI>'s evidence; but he was &s;o profligate a man, that great and ju&s;t objections lay again&s;t giving him any credit; But the Carrier's evidence was not &s;haken. <HI>Lunt,</HI> in the Trial, had named two Gentlemen wrong, mi&s;taking the one for the other: But he quickly cor|rected his mi&s;take, he had &s;een them but once, and they were both together; So he might mi&s;take their names: But he was &s;ure the&s;e were the two per&s;ons, with whom he had tho&s;e trea|&s;onable Negotiations. <HI>Taff</HI> had engaged him in company in <HI>London,</HI> to whom he had talked very idly, like a man who re&s;olved to make a fortune by &s;wearing: And it &s;eemed, by

what he &s;aid, that he had many di&s;coveries yet in re&s;erve, which he intended to &s;pread among many, till he &s;hould grow rich and con&s;iderable by it: This was &s;worn again&s;t him: By all the&s;e things, his Evidence was &s;o bla&s;ted, that no credit was given to him. Four of the Judges were &s;ent down to try the Pri&s;oners at <HI>Manche&s;ter,</HI> and at <HI>Che&s;ter;</HI> where they managed matters with an impartial exactne&s;s: Any leaning that appear|ed, was in favour of the Pri&s;oners, according to a Characte|ri&s;tick, that Judges had always pretended to, but had not of late de&s;erved &s;o well, as upon this occa&s;ion, of being Council for the Pri&s;oner. The evidence, that was brought again&s;t <HI>Lunt,</HI> was afterwards found to be fal&s;e; But it looked then with &s;o good an appearance, that both the King's Council and the Judges were &s;atisfied with it; And &s;o, without calling for the re&s;t of the Evidence, the matter was let fall: And when the Judges gave the Charge to the Jury, it was in favour of the Pri&s;oners, &s;o that they were acquitted. And the re&s;t of tho&s;e, who were ordered to be tried after them, were all di&s;|charged without Trial.</P>
<P>The whole Party triumphed upon this, as a Victory; and complained both of the Mini&s;ters of State, and of the Judges; The matter was examined into, by both Hou&s;es of Parliament; and it evidently appeared, that the proceeding had been, not only exactly according to Law, but that all rea&s;onable favour had been &s;hewed the Pri&s;oners: So that both Hou&s;es were fully &s;atisfied; Only the Earls of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Nottingham</HI> hung on the matter long, and with great eagerne&s;s; and in conclu&s;ion, prote&s;ted again&s;t the Vote, by which the Lords ju&s;tified the&s;e proceedings. This Examination was brought on with much noi&s;e, to give the more &s;trength to the Bill of Trea&s;ons: But the progre&s;s of the examination turned &s;o much again&s;t Them, who had made this u&s;e of it, that it appeared there was no ju&s;t occa&s;ion, given by that Trial, to alter the Law. Yet the Commons pa&s;&s;ed the Bill: But the Lords in&s;i&s;ted on a clau&s;e, that all the Peers &s;hould be &s;ummoned to the Trial of a Peer, that was charged with High Trea&s;on; The Commons would not agree to that; And &s;o the Bill was dropt for this time. By the late Trial, it had manife&s;tly appeared, how little the Crown gained by one thing, which yet was thought an ad|vantage; that the Witne&s;&s;es for the Pri&s;oner were not upon Oath: Many things were upon this occa&s;ion witne&s;&s;ed in favour of the Pri&s;oners, which were afterwards found to be notoriou&s;ly fal&s;e; And it is certain, that the terror of an Oath is a great re&s;traint, and many, whom an Oath might over-awe, would
<PB N="144" REF="165">
more freely allow them&s;elves the liberty of Lying, in behalf of a Pri&s;oner, to &s;ave his life.</P>
<P>When this de&s;ign failed, another was &s;et up again&s;t the Bank, which began to have a flouri&s;hing credit, and had &s;upplied the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Complaints of the Bank.</NOTE> King &s;o regularly with money, and that upon &s;uch rea&s;onable terms, that tho&s;e who intended to make matters go heavily, tri|ed what could be done to &s;hake the credit of the Bank. But this attempt was rejected in both Hou&s;es with indignation; It was very evident, that publick Credit would &s;ignify little, if what was e&s;tabli&s;hed in one Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, might be fallen upon, and &s;haken in another.</P>
<P>Towards the end of the Se&s;&s;ion, complaints were made of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Enquiries into corrupt practices.</NOTE> &s;ome Military men, who did not pay their Quarters, pretending their own pay was in arrear; But it appearing, that they had been payed; and the matter being further examined into, it was found, that the &s;uperior Officers had cheated the Subalterns, which excu&s;ed their not paying their Quarters. Upon this, the enquiry was carried further; And &s;uch di&s;coveries were made, that &s;ome Officers were broke upon it, while others prevented complaints, by &s;atisfying tho&s;e, whom they had oppre&s;&s;ed: It was found out, that the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury had taken two hundred Guineas, for procuring the Arrears due to a Re|giment, to be payed; whereupon, he was &s;ent to the Tower, and turned out of his place: Many were the more &s;harpned a|gain&s;t him, becau&s;e it was believed that he, as well as <HI>Trevor</HI> the Speaker, were deeply concerned in corrupting the Members of the Hou&s;e of Commons: He had held his place both in King <HI>Charles</HI> and King <HI>James</HI>'s time: And the &s;hare he had in the &s;ecret di&s;tribution of money, had made him a nece&s;&s;ary man for tho&s;e methods.</P>
<P>But the Hou&s;e, being on this &s;cent, carried the matter &s;till further. In the former Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, an Act had pa&s;&s;ed, creating a Fund for the repayment of the Debt owing to the Orphans, by the Chamber of <HI>London;</HI> And the Chamber had made <HI>Trevor</HI> a Pre&s;ent of a thou&s;and Guineas, for the Service he did them in that matter; This was entred in their Books; So that full proof was made of it. It was indeed believed, that a much greater Pre&s;ent had been made him in behalf of the Orphans: But no proof of that appeared; Whereas, what had been taken in &s;o publick a manner could not be hid. This was objected to <HI>Trevor</HI> as Corruption, and a Breach of Tru&s;t; And upon it, he was expelled the Hou&s;e; And Mr. <HI>Paul Foley</HI> was cho&s;en Speaker in his room; who had got great credit by his Integrity, and his con&s;tant complaining of the Admini&s;tration.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="166">
One di&s;covery made way for another: It was found, that in the Books of the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Company, there were Entries made of great Sums given, for &s;ecret Service done the Company, <NOTE PLACE="marg">And into the Pre&s;ents made by the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company.</NOTE> that amounted to 170000 Pounds; And it was generally be|lieved, that the greate&s;t part of it had gone among the Members of the Hou&s;e of Commons; For the two preceeding Winters, there had been attempts, eagerly pur&s;ued by &s;ome, for break|ing the Company, and either opening a free Trade to the <HI>In|dies,</HI> or at lea&s;t, erecting a new Company: But it was ob&s;erv|ed, that &s;ome of the hotte&s;t &s;ticklers again&s;t the Company, did in&s;en&s;ibly, not only fall off from that heat, but turned to &s;erve the Company, as much as they had at fir&s;t endeavoured to de&s;troy it. <HI>Seimour</HI> was among the chief of the&s;e: And it was &s;aid, that he had 12000 Pounds of their money, under the colour of a Bargain for their Salt-petre. Great pains and art was u&s;ed to &s;tifle this Enquiry; But curio&s;ity, envy, and ill-nature, as well as vertue, will on &s;uch occa&s;ions always prevail, to &s;et on enquiries. Tho&s;e, who have had nothing, de&s;ire to know who have had &s;omething, while the guilty per&s;ons dare not &s;hew too great a concern in oppo&s;ing di&s;coveries. Sir <HI>Thomas Cook,</HI> a rich Merchant, who was Governour of the Company, was exa|mined concerning that great Sum given for Secret Service; But he refu&s;ed to an&s;wer. So a &s;evere Bill was brought in again&s;t him, in ca&s;e he &s;hould not, by a prefixed day, confe&s;s how all that money had been di&s;po&s;ed of. When the Bill was &s;ent up to the Lords, and was like to pa&s;s, he came in, and offer|ed to make a full di&s;covery, if he might be indemnified, for all that he had done, or that he might &s;ay in that matter: The Enemies of the Court hoped for great di&s;coveries, that &s;hould di&s;grace both the Mini&s;ters and the Favourites; But it appeared, that, whereas both King <HI>Charles</HI> and King <HI>James</HI> had obliged the Company, to make them a yearly pre&s;ent of 10000 Pounds, that the King had received this but once; and that, tho' the Company offered a Pre&s;ent of 50000 Pounds, if the King would grant them a new Charter, and con&s;ent to an Act of Parliament confirming it, the King had refu&s;ed to hear|ken to it. There were indeed pre&s;umptions, that the Mar|qui&s;s of <HI>Caermarthen</HI> had taken a Pre&s;ent of 5000 Guineas, which were &s;ent back to Sir <HI>Thomas Cook,</HI> the morning before he was to make his di&s;covery. The Lords appointed twelve of their Body to meet with twenty four of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, to examine into this matter; But they were &s;o ill &s;a|tisfied with the account, that was given them, by the four per&s;ons who had been entru&s;ted with this &s;ecret, that by a par|ticular
<PB N="146" REF="167">
Act, that pa&s;&s;ed both Hou&s;es, they were committed to the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> till the end of the next Se&s;&s;ion of Par|liament, and re&s;trained from di&s;po&s;ing of their E&s;tates, real or per&s;onal. The&s;e were proceedings of an extraordinary nature, which could not be ju&s;tified, but from the extraordinary occa|&s;ion that was given for them. Some &s;aid, this looked like the &s;etting up a Court of Inqui&s;ition, when new Laws were made on purpo&s;e to di&s;cover &s;ecret Tran&s;actions; and that no bounds could be &s;et to &s;uch a method of proceeding. Others &s;aid, that when Entries were made of &s;uch Sums, &s;ecretly di&s;po&s;ed of, it was as ju&s;t for a Parliament to force a confe&s;&s;ion, as it was common in the cour&s;e of the Law to <HI>&s;ubpoena</HI> a man, to declare all his knowledge of any matter, how &s;ecretly &s;oever it might have been managed, and what per&s;on &s;oever might have been concerned in it. The Lord Pre&s;ident felt, that he was deeply wounded with this di&s;covery; For while the Act, again&s;t <HI>Cook,</HI> was pa&s;&s;ing in the Hou&s;e of Lords, he took occa&s;ion to affirm, with &s;olemn prote&s;tations, that he him&s;elf was not at all concerned in that matter; But now all had broke out: One <HI>Firebra&s;s</HI> a Merchant, employed by the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company, had treated with <HI>Bates,</HI> a friend of the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Caermar|then</HI>'s; and for the favour that Lord was to do them, in pro|curing them a new Charter, <HI>Bates</HI> was to have for his u&s;e five thou&s;and Guineas. But now a new turn was to be given to all this: <HI>Bates</HI> &s;wore, that he indeed received the money, and that he offered it to that Lord, who po&s;itively refu&s;ed to take it: But, &s;ince it was already payed in, he advi&s;ed <HI>Bates</HI> to keep it to him&s;elf; tho' by the examination, it appeared, that <HI>Bates</HI> was to have five hundred Pounds for his own negotiating the affair: It did al&s;o appear, that the money was payed into one of that Lord's Servants; But he could not be come at: Upon this di&s;|covery, the Hou&s;e of Commons voted an Impeachment for a Mi&s;demeanour again&s;t the Lord Pre&s;ident; He, to prevent that, de&s;ired to be heard &s;peak to that Hou&s;e in his own Ju&s;tification; When he was before them, he &s;et out the &s;ervices that he had done the Nation, in terms that were not thought very decent; He a&s;&s;umed the greate&s;t &s;hare of the honour of the Revolu|tion to him&s;elf; He expre&s;&s;ed a great unea&s;ine&s;s, to be brought under &s;o black an Imputation, from which he cleared him&s;elf as much as words could do; In the end, he de&s;ired a pre&s;ent Trial. Articles were upon that brought again&s;t him; He, in an&s;wer to the&s;e, denied his having received the money. But his Ser|vant, who&s;e te&s;timony only could have cleared that point, di&s;|appearing, the &s;u&s;picion &s;tuck &s;till on him. It was intended to
<PB N="147" REF="168">
hang up the matter to another Se&s;&s;ion; But an Act of Grace came in the end of this, with an exception indeed as to Cor|ruption; Yet this whole di&s;covery was let fall, and it was be|lieved, too many of all &s;ides were concerned in it: For by a common con&s;ent, it was never revived; And thus the Se&s;&s;ion ended.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t con&s;ultation, after it was over, was concerning the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;ulta|tions about the Coin.</NOTE> Coin, what methods &s;hould be taken to prevent further clip|ping, and for remedying &s;o great an abu&s;e. Some propo&s;ed the recoining the money, with &s;uch a rai&s;ing of the value of the Species, as &s;hould ballance the lo&s;s upon the old money, that was to be called in: This took with &s;o many, that it was not ea&s;y to correct an error, that mu&s;t have had very bad ef|fects in the conclu&s;ion: For the only fixed &s;tandard mu&s;t be the intrin&s;ick value of an Ounce of Silver; And it was a publick Robbery, that would very much prejudice our Trade, not to keep the value of our Species, near an equality with its weight and finene&s;s in Silver. So that the difference, between the old and new money, could only be &s;et right by the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, in a Supply to be given for that end. The Lord Keeper <HI>Somers</HI> did indeed propo&s;e that, which would have put an ef|fectual &s;top to clipping for the future; It was, that a Procla|mation &s;hould be prepared with &s;uch &s;ecrecy, as to be pub|li&s;hed over all <HI>England</HI> on the &s;ame day, ordering money to pa&s;s only by weight; but that, at the &s;ame time, during three or four days after the Proclamation, all per&s;ons in every County, that had money, &s;hould bring it in to be told and weighed; and the difference was to be regi&s;tred, and the money to be &s;ealed up, to the end of the time given, and then to be re&s;tored to the owners; and an a&s;&s;urance was to be given, that this deficiency in weight, &s;hould be laid before the Parliament, to be &s;uppli|ed another way, and to be allowed them in the following Taxes. But tho' the King liked this propo&s;ition, yet all the re&s;t of the Council were again&s;t it. They &s;aid, this would &s;top the circulation of money, and might occa&s;ion tumults in the Markets. Tho&s;e, who&s;e money was thus to be weighed, would not believe that the difference, between the tale and the weight, would be allowed them, and &s;o might grow mutinous; Therefore, they were for leaving this matter, to the Con&s;idera|tion of the next Parliament. So this propo&s;ition was laid a&s;ide: which would have &s;aved the Nation above a million of money. For now, as all people believed, that the Parliament would re|ceive the clipt money in its tale, clipping went on, and became more vi&s;ibly &s;candalous, than ever it had been.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="169">
There was indeed rea&s;on to apprehend Tumults; For now, after the Queen's death, the Jacobites began to think, that the Government had lo&s;t the half of its &s;trength, and that things <NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;ulta|tions among the Jaco|bites.</NOTE> could not be kept quiet at home, when the King &s;hould be beyond Sea. Some pretended, they were for putting the Prin|ce&s;s, in her Si&s;ter's place; But that was only a pretence, to which &s;he gave no &s;ort of encouragement: King <HI>James</HI> lay at bottom. They fancied, an Inva&s;ion in the King's ab&s;ence would be an ea&s;y attempt, which would meet with little re&s;i&s;tance: So they &s;ent &s;ome over to <HI>France,</HI> in particular one <HI>Charnock,</HI> a Fellow of <HI>Magdalen</HI> College, who in King <HI>James</HI>'s time had turned Papi&s;t, and was a hot and active Agent among them: They undertook to bring a Body of 2000 Hor&s;e, to meet &s;uch an Army as &s;hould be &s;ent over; But <HI>Charnock</HI> came back with a cold account, that nothing could be done at that time; Upon which it was thought nece&s;&s;ary, to &s;end over a man of Quality, who &s;hould pre&s;s the matter with &s;ome more autho|rity: So the Earl of <HI>Ailesbury</HI> was prevailed on to go: He was admitted to a &s;ecret conver&s;ation with the <HI>French</HI> King: And this gave ri&s;e to a De&s;ign, which was very near being executed the following Winter.</P>
<P>But if Sir <HI>John Fenwick</HI> did not &s;lander King <HI>James,</HI> they at <NOTE PLACE="marg">A de&s;ign to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the King.</NOTE> this time propo&s;ed a &s;horter and more infallible way, by a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;inating the King; For he &s;aid, that &s;ome came over from <HI>France</HI> about this time, who a&s;&s;ured their Party, and him&s;elf in parti|cular, that a Commi&s;&s;ion was coming over, &s;igned by King <HI>James,</HI> which they affirmed they had &s;een, warranting them to attack the King's Per&s;on. This, it is true, was not yet arrived; But &s;ome affirmed, they had &s;een it, and that it was tru&s;ted to One, who was on his way hither; Therefore, &s;ince the King was &s;o near going over to <HI>Holland,</HI> that he would probably be gone before the Commi&s;&s;ion could be in <HI>England;</HI> it was de|bated among the Jacobites, whether they ought not to take the fir&s;t opportunity to execute this Commi&s;&s;ion, even tho' they had it not in their hands: It was re&s;olved to do it; and a day was &s;et for it; But as <HI>Fenwick</HI> &s;aid, he broke the de&s;ign; and &s;ent them word, that he would di&s;cover it, if they would not promi&s;e to give over the thoughts of it: And upon this rea&s;on, he believed, he was not let into the &s;ecret the following win|ter. This his Lady told me from him, as an article of merit to obtain his pardon: But he had tru&s;ted their word very ea&s;ily, it &s;eems, &s;ince he gave the King no warning to be on his guard; And the two witne&s;&s;es, whom he &s;aid he could pro|duce to vouch this, were then under pro&s;ecution, and out-law|ed:
<PB N="149" REF="170">
So that the proof was not at hand, and the warning had not been given, as it ought to have been. But of all this, the Government knew nothing, and &s;u&s;pected nothing at this time.</P>
<P>The King &s;ettled the Government of <HI>England</HI> in &s;even Lords <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Govern|ment in the King's ab|&s;ence.</NOTE> Ju&s;tices, during his ab&s;ence; And in this, a great error was committed, which had &s;ome ill effects, and was like to have had wor&s;e: The Queen, when She was dying, had received a kind Letter from, and had &s;ent a reconciling Me&s;&s;age to the Prince&s;s; And &s;o, that breach was made up. It is true, the Si&s;ters did not meet; It was thought, That might throw the Queen into too great a commotion; So it was put off till it was too late; Yet the Prince&s;s came &s;oon after to &s;ee the King; And there was after that an appearance of a good cor|re&s;pondence between them: But it was little more than an ap|pearance. They lived &s;till in terms of civility, and in formal vi&s;its. But the King did not bring her into any &s;hare in bu&s;ine&s;s; nor did he order his Mini&s;ters to wait on her, and give her any ac|count of Affairs. And now, that he was to go beyond Sea, &s;he was not &s;et at the head of the Councils, nor was there any care taken, to oblige tho&s;e who were about her. This looked either like a jealou&s;y and di&s;tru&s;t, or a coldne&s;s towards her, which gave all the &s;ecret Enemies of the Government a co|lour of complaint. They pretended zeal for the Prince&s;s, tho' they came little to her; And they made it very vi&s;ible, on many occa&s;ions, that this was only a di&s;gui&s;e for wor&s;e de&s;igns.</P>

So that no other per&s;on could think he was neglected, by the preference: They were not envied for this Titular Greatne&s;s; Since it was indeed only Titular; For they had no real Authority tru&s;ted with them. They took care to keep within bounds, and to do nothing, but in matters of cour&s;e, till they had the King's Orders, to which they adhered exactly: So that no complaints could be made of them, becau&s;e they took nothing on them, and did only keep the peace of the King|dom, and tran&s;mit and execute the King's Orders.

made the attempt &s;eem bold and doubtful; The dry Sea&s;on put the King under another difficulty; The <HI>Mae&s;e</HI> was &s;o low, that there was not water enough to bring up the Barks, loaden with Artillery and Ammunition, from <HI>Liege</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;tricht;</HI> So that, many days were lo&s;t in bringing the&s;e over Land; And if <HI>Villeroy</HI> had followed the King clo&s;e, it is thought he mu&s;t have quitted the de&s;ign: But the <HI>French</HI> pre&s;umed upon the &s;trength of the Place and Garri&s;on, and on our being &s;o little practi&s;ed in Sieges: They thought, that <HI>Villeroy</HI> might make &s;ome con&s;iderable Conque&s;t in <HI>Flanders,</HI> and when that was done, come in good time to rai&s;e the Siege. Prince <HI>Vaude|mont</HI> managed his Army with &s;uch skill and conduct, that as he covered all the Places, on which he thought the <HI>French</HI> had an eye, &s;o he marched with that caution, that tho' <HI>Ville|roy</HI> had above double his &s;trength, yet he could not force him to an engagement, nor gain any advantage over him. The Military men, that &s;erved under him, magnified his conduct highly, and compared it to any thing that <HI>Turenne,</HI> or the great|e&s;t Generals of the Age had done. Once it was thought, he could not get off; But he marched under the Cannon of <HI>Ghent</HI> without any lo&s;s. In this, <HI>Villeroy</HI>'s conduct was blamed, but without cau&s;e; For he had not over&s;een his advantage, but had ordered the Duke of <HI>Mayne,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> King's beloved Son, to make a motion with the Hor&s;e, which he commanded; And probably, if that had been &s;peedily executed, it might have had ill effects on the Prince of <HI>Vaudemont:</HI> But the Duke <HI>de Mayne</HI> de&s;pi&s;ed <HI>Villeroy,</HI> and made no ha&s;te to obey his Orders, &s;o the advantage was lo&s;t, and the King of <HI>France</HI> put him under a &s;light di&s;grace for it. <HI>Villeroy</HI> attackt <HI>Dixmuyde</HI> and <HI>Dein&s;e;</HI> The Garri&s;ons were not indeed able to make a great re&s;i&s;tance; But they were ill commanded: If their Officers had been Ma&s;ters of a true judgment, or pre&s;ence of mind, they might at lea&s;t have got a favourable compo&s;ition, and have &s;aved the Garri&s;ons, tho' the Places were not tenable; Yet they were ba&s;ely delivered up, and about 7000 men were made pri&s;oners of War. And hereupon, tho' by a Cartel that had been &s;ettled between the two Armies, all Pri&s;oners were to be redeemed at a &s;et price, and within a limited time: Yet the <HI>French,</HI> having now &s;o many men in their hands, did, without either colour or &s;hame, give a new e&s;&s;ay of their perfidiou&s;ne&s;s; for they broke it, upon this occa&s;ion, as they had often done at Sea; indeed, as often as any advantages on their &s;ide tempted them to it: The Governours of tho&s;e places were at fir&s;t believed to have betrayed their Tru&s;t, and &s;old the Garri&s;ons, as well as the
<PB N="152" REF="173">
places to the <HI>French;</HI> But they were tried afterwards; And it appeared, that it flowed from Cowardice, and want of Sen&s;e; for which one of them &s;uffered, and the other was broke with di&s;grace.</P>
<P><HI>Villeroy</HI> marched toward <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> and was followed by Prince <HI>Vaudemont,</HI> who&s;e chief care was, to order his motions &s;o, that <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bru&s;&s;el</HI>'s was bom|barded.</NOTE> the <HI>French</HI> might not get between him, and the King's Camp at <HI>Namur.</HI> He apprehended, that <HI>Villeroy</HI> might bombard <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> and would have hindred it, if the Town could have been wrought on, to give him the a&s;&s;i&s;tance that he de&s;ired of them: Town&s;men, upon all &s;uch occa&s;ions, are more apt to con&s;ider a pre&s;ent, tho' a &s;mall expence, than a great, tho' an imminent danger: So Prince <HI>Vaudemont</HI> could not pretend to cover them: The Electore&s;s of <HI>Bavaria</HI> was then in the Town; And tho' <HI>Villeroy</HI> &s;ent a Complement to her, yet he did not give her time to retire; but bombarded the place for two days, with &s;o much fury, that a great part of the lower Town was burnt down: The damage was valued at &s;ome Millions, and the Electore&s;s was &s;o frighted, that &s;he mi&s;carried upon it of a Boy. When this execution was done, <HI>Villeroy</HI> marched towards <HI>Namur;</HI> His Army was now &s;o much encrea&s;ed, by Detach|ments brought from the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and Troops drawn out of Gar|ri&s;ons, that it was &s;aid to be 100000 &s;trong: Both Armies on the <HI>Rhine,</HI> were &s;o equal in &s;trength, that they could only lie on a Defen&s;ive; neither &s;ide being &s;trong enough to undertake any thing: M. <HI>De L'Orge</HI> commanded the <HI>French,</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Baden,</HI> the Imperiali&s;ts: The former was &s;inking as much in his health as in his credit; So a great Body was ordered to march from him to <HI>Villeroy;</HI> And another Body equal to that, commanded by the Landgrave of <HI>He&s;&s;e,</HI> came and joined the King's Army.</P>
<P>The Siege was carried on with great vigour; The errors, to <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Namur</HI> was taken.</NOTE> which our want of practice expo&s;ed us, were all corrected by the courage of our men; The Fortifications, both in &s;trength, and in the extent of the out-works, were double to what they had been when the <HI>French</HI> took the place; Our men did not only &s;ucceed in every attack, but went much further: In the fir&s;t great Sally, the <HI>French</HI> lo&s;t &s;o many, both Officers and Sol|diers, that after that, they kept within their Works, and gave us no di&s;turbance: Both the King and the Elector of <HI>Ba|varia,</HI> went frequently into the Trenches; The Town held out one Month, and the Cittadel another: Upon <HI>Villeroy</HI>'s ap|proach, the King drew off all the Troops that could be &s;pared from the Siege, and placed him&s;elf in his way, with an Army
<PB N="153" REF="174">
of 60000 men; But he was &s;o well po&s;ted, that after <HI>Villeroy</HI> had looked on him for &s;ome days, he found it was not advi&s;a|ble to attack him: Our men wi&s;hed for a Battle, as that which would not only decide the fate of <HI>Namur,</HI> but of the whole War; The <HI>French</HI> gave it out, that they would put all to hazard, rather than &s;uffer &s;uch a diminution of their King's Glory, as the retaking that place &s;eemed to be; But the Signal of the Cittadel's treating, put an end to <HI>Villeroy</HI>'s de&s;igns: Upon which, he apprehending that the King might then attack him, drew off with &s;o much precipitation, that it looked liker a flight than a retreat.</P>
<P>The Capitulation was &s;oon ended and &s;igned by <HI>Bouflers,</HI> who, as was &s;aid, was the fir&s;t Mare&s;chal of <HI>France</HI> that had ever delivered up a place; He marched out with 5000 men, &s;o it appeared he had lo&s;t 7000 during the Siege: And we lo&s;t in it only about the &s;ame number. This was reckoned one of the greate&s;t actions of the King's Life, and indeed, one of the greate&s;t that is in the whole Hi&s;tory of War. It rai&s;ed his Cha|racter much, both at home and abroad, and gave a great repu|tation to his Troops: The King had the entire Credit of the matter; His General Officers having a very &s;mall &s;hare in it, being mo&s;t of them men of low Genius, and little practi&s;ed in things of that nature. <HI>Cohorn,</HI> the chief Engineer, &s;ignalized him&s;elf &s;o eminently on this occa&s;ion, that he was looked on as the greate&s;t Man of the Age: and out-did even <HI>Vauban,</HI> who had gone far beyond all tho&s;e, that went before him, in the conduct of Sieges: But it was confe&s;&s;ed by all, that <HI>Cohorn</HI> had carried that Art to a much farther perfection during this Siege. The Subaltern Officers and Soldiers gave hopes of a better race, that was growing up, and &s;upplied the errors and defects of their Superior Officers. As the Garri&s;on marched out, the King ordered <HI>Bouflers</HI> to be &s;topt, in repri&s;al for the Garri|&s;ons of <HI>Dixmuyde</HI> and <HI>Dein&s;e. Bouflers</HI> complained of this as a Breach of Articles, and the action &s;eemed liable to cen&s;ure. But many authorities and precedents were brought, both from Law and Hi&s;tory, to ju&s;tify it: All obligations among Princes, both in Peace and War, mu&s;t be judged to be reciprocal; So that he who breaks the&s;e fir&s;t, &s;ets the other at liberty. At length, the <HI>French</HI> con&s;ented to &s;end back the Garri&s;ons, pur|&s;uant to the Cartel; <HI>Bouflers</HI> was fir&s;t &s;et at liberty, and then the&s;e Garri&s;ons were relea&s;ed according to promi&s;e.</P>
<P>The Officers were tried and proceded again&s;t, by Councils of War, according to Martial Law; They were rai&s;ed in the Army by ill methods, and maintained them&s;elves by wor&s;e; Corrup|tion

had broke into the Army, and Oppre&s;&s;ion and Inju&s;tice were much complained of; The King did not approve of tho&s;e practices; But he did not enquire after them, nor puni&s;h them, with a due &s;everity; Nor did he make difference enough be|tween tho&s;e who &s;erved well, &s;old nothing, and u&s;ed their Sub|alterns kindly, and tho&s;e who &s;et every thing to &s;ale, and op|pre&s;&s;ed all that were under them; and when things of that kind go unpuni&s;hed, they will &s;oon make a great progre&s;s. There was little more done, during the Campaign in <HI>Flanders;</HI> Nor was there any Action upon the <HI>Rhine.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Italy,</HI> there was nothing done in the Field by force of Arms: But an affair of great con&s;equence was tran&s;acted, in a very my&s;terious manner; The Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> after a very long Blockade, undertook the Siege of <HI>Ca&s;al;</HI> but he was &s;o ill pro|vided <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ca&s;al</HI> was &s;urrendred.</NOTE> for it, that no good account of it could be expected; The King had &s;o little hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, that he was not ea&s;ily prevailed on to con&s;ent to the be&s;ieging it; But either the <HI>French</HI> intended to gain the Pope and the <HI>Venetians,</HI> and in conclu&s;ion, that Duke him&s;elf, with this extraordinary conce&s;|&s;ion; Or, &s;ince our Fleet was then before <HI>Toulon,</HI> they judged it more nece&s;&s;ary to keep their Troops, for the defence of their Coa&s;t and Fleet, than to &s;end them to relieve <HI>Ca&s;al;</HI> So Orders were &s;ent to the Governour to Capitulate, in &s;uch a number of days, after the Trenches were opened: So that the Place was &s;urrendred, tho' it was not at all &s;traitned: It was agreed, that it &s;hould be re&s;tored to the Duke of <HI>Mantua,</HI> but &s;o di&s;mant|led, that it might give jealou&s;y to no &s;ide; And the &s;lighting the Fortifications went on &s;o &s;lowly, that the whole Sea&s;on was &s;pent in it, a Truce being granted all that while. Thus did the <HI>French</HI> give up <HI>Ca&s;al,</HI> after they had been at a va&s;t expence in fortifying it, and had made it one of the &s;tronge&s;t places in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Our Fleet was all the Summer, Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Mediterra|nean;</HI> The <HI>French</HI> were put under great di&s;order, and &s;eemed <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs at Sea.</NOTE> to apprehend a De&s;cent; For <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> came before <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> and <HI>Toulon</HI> oftner than once; Contrary Winds forced him out to Sea again, but with no lo&s;s; He him&s;elf told me, he believed nothing could be done there; Only the honour of command|ing the Sea, and of &s;hutting the <HI>French</HI> within their Ports, gave a great reputation to our affairs. In <HI>Catalonia,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> made no progre&s;s; They abandoned <HI>Palamos,</HI> and made <HI>Gi|ronne</HI> their Frontier. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> once pretended to be&s;iege <HI>Palamos,</HI> but they only pretended to do it; They de&s;ired &s;ome men from <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> for he had Regiments of Marines on Board:
<PB N="155" REF="176">
They &s;aid, they had begun the Siege, and were provided with every thing that was nece&s;&s;ary to carry it on, only they wanted men; So he &s;ent them &s;ome Battalions; But when they came thither, they found not any one thing, that was nece&s;&s;ary to carry on a Siege, not &s;o much as Spades, not to mention Guns and Ammunition: So <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> &s;ent for his men back again. But the <HI>French</HI> of them&s;elves quitted the place; for as they found the charge of the War in <HI>Catalonia</HI> was great, and tho' they met with a feeble oppo&s;ition from the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> yet &s;ince they &s;aw, they could not carry <HI>Barcelona,</HI> &s;o long as our Fleet lay in tho&s;e Seas, they re&s;olved to lay by, in expectation of a better occa&s;ion. We had another Fleet in our own Channel, that was ordered to bombard the <HI>French</HI> Coa&s;t; They did &s;ome execu|tion upon St. <HI>Malos,</HI> and de&s;troyed <HI>Grandville,</HI> that lay not far from it: They al&s;o attempted <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> but failed in the execution; Some Bombs were thrown into <HI>Calais,</HI> but with|out any great effect; So that the <HI>French</HI> did not &s;uffer &s;o much by the Bombardment, as was expected: The Country indeed was much alarmed by it; They had many Troops di&s;|per&s;ed all along their Coa&s;t; So that it put their affairs in great di&s;order, and we were every where Ma&s;ters at Sea. Another Squadron, commanded by the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Carmarthen</HI> (who&s;e Father was created Duke of <HI>Leeds,</HI> to colour the di&s;mi&s;&s;ing him from bu&s;ine&s;s, with an encrea&s;e of Title) lay off from the I&s;les of <HI>Scilly,</HI> to &s;ecure our Trade, and convoy our Merchants: He was an extravagant man, both in his Plea&s;ures and Hu|mours; He was &s;low in going to Sea; and, when he was out, he fancied the <HI>French</HI> Fleet was coming up to him, which proved to be only a Fleet of Merchant Ships: So he left his &s;ta|tion, and retired into <HI>Milford Haven:</HI> By which means, that Squadron became u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>This proved fatal to our Trade; Many of our <HI>Barbadoes</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lo&s;&s;es of our Mer|chants.</NOTE> Ships were taken by <HI>French</HI> Cruizers and Privateers: Two rich Ships, coming from the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> were al&s;o taken, 150 Leagues to the We&s;tward, by a very fatal accident, or by &s;ome treacherous adverti&s;ement; for Cruizers &s;eldom go &s;o far into the Ocean: And to compleat the misfortunes of the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company, three other Ships, that were come near <HI>Gallway,</HI> on the We&s;t of <HI>Ireland,</HI> fell into the hands of &s;ome <HI>French</HI> Privateers: Tho&s;e five Ships were valued at a Million, &s;o here was great occa&s;ion of di&s;content in the City of <HI>London.</HI> They complained, that neither the Admiralty, nor the Government, took the care that was nece&s;&s;ary for pre&s;erving the Wealth of the Nation. A <HI>French</HI> Man of War, at the &s;ame time, fell upon our
<PB N="156" REF="177">
Factory on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea;</HI> He took the &s;mall Fort we had there, and de&s;troyed it; The&s;e misfortunes were very &s;en|&s;ible to the Nation, and did much abate the Joy, which &s;o glorious a Campaign would otherwi&s;e have rai&s;ed; And much matter was laid in for ill humour to work upon.</P>
<P>The War went on in <HI>Hungary;</HI> The new Grand <HI>Signior</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in <HI>Hungary.</HI></NOTE> came late into the Field; But as late as it was, the Imperiali&s;ts were not ready to receive him: He tried to force his way into <HI>Tran&s;ilvania,</HI> and took &s;ome weak and ill defended Forts, which he &s;oon after abandoned; <HI>Veterani,</HI> who was the mo&s;t beloved of all the Emperor's Generals, lay with a &s;mall Army to de|fend the Entrance into <HI>Tran&s;ilvania;</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> fell upon him, and overpowered him with numbers; His Army was de&s;troyed, and him&s;elf killed; But they &s;old their Lives dear; The <HI>Turks</HI> lo&s;t double their number, and their be&s;t Troops in the action; So that they had only the name and honour of a Victory; They were not able to pro&s;ecute it, nor to draw any advantage from it. The &s;tragglers of the defeated Army drew together, towards the Pa&s;&s;es. But none purfued them, and the <HI>Turks</HI> marched back to <HI>Andrianople,</HI> with the Triumph of having made a glorious Campaign. There were &s;ome &s;light Engage|ments at Sea, between the <HI>Venetians</HI> and the <HI>Turks,</HI> in which, the former pretended they had the advantage; But nothing fol|lowed upon them. Thus affairs went on abroad during this Summer.</P>
<P>There was a Parliament held in <HI>Scotland,</HI> where the Mar|qui&s;s <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parlia|ment in <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> of <HI>Tweedale</HI> was the King's Commi&s;&s;ioner: Every thing that was asked for the King's Supply, and for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tance of his Troops, was granted; The Ma&s;&s;acre in <HI>Glencoe,</HI> made &s;till a great noi&s;e; and the King &s;eemed too remi&s;s in inquir|ing into it. But when it was repre&s;ented to him, that a Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament could not be managed, without high motions and complaints of &s;o crying a matter, and that his Mini&s;ters could not oppo&s;e the&s;e, without &s;eeming to bring the guilt of that Blood, that was &s;o perfidiou&s;ly &s;hed, both on the King, and on them&s;elves: To prevent that, he ordered a Commi&s;&s;ion to be pa&s;&s;ed under the Great Seal, for a precognition in that matter, which is a practice in the Law of <HI>Scotland,</HI> of exa|mining into Crimes, before the Per&s;ons concerned are brought upon their Trial. This was looked on as an artifice, to cover that tran&s;action by a private enquiry; Yet, when it was com|plained of in Parliament, not without reflections on the &s;lack|ne&s;s in examining into it, the King's Commi&s;&s;ioner a&s;&s;ured them, that by the King's Order, the matter was then under examina|tion,
<PB N="157" REF="178">
and that it &s;hould be reported to the Parliament: The Enquiry went on; And, in the progre&s;s of it, a new practice of the Earl of <HI>Braidalbin</HI>'s was di&s;covered; For the Highlanders depo&s;ed that, while he was treating with them, in order to their &s;ubmitting to the King, he had a&s;&s;ured them, that he &s;till ad|hered to King <HI>James</HI>'s Intere&s;t, and that he pre&s;&s;ed them to come into that Pacification, only to pre&s;erve them for his &s;ervice, till a more favourable opportunity. This, with &s;everal other trea&s;onable di&s;cour&s;es of his, being reported to the Parliament, he covered him&s;elf with his pardon; But the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es hap|pened to be &s;ub&s;equent to it; So he was &s;ent a Pri&s;oner to the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Edinburgh:</HI> He pretended, he had &s;ecret Orders from the King, to &s;ay any thing that would give him credit with them; which the King owned &s;o far, that he ordered a new pardon to be pa&s;t for him. A great Party came to be formed in this Se&s;&s;ion, of a very odd mixture; The High Presbyteri|ans, and the Jacobites, joined together to oppo&s;e every thing; Yet it was not &s;o &s;trong as to carry the Majority; But great heats aro&s;e among them.</P>
<P>The Report of the Ma&s;&s;acre of <HI>Glencoe,</HI> was made in full <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bu&s;i|ne&s;s of <HI>Glen+coe</HI> examin|ed.</NOTE> Parliament: By that it appeared, that a black de&s;ign was laid, not only to cut off the men of <HI>Glencoe,</HI> but a great many more Clans, reckoned to be in all above Six Thou&s;and per&s;ons: The whole was pur&s;ued in many Letters, that were writ with great earne&s;tne&s;s; And tho' the King's Orders carried nothing in them, that was in any &s;ort blameable, yet the Secretary of <HI>State</HI>'s Letters went much further. So the Parliament ju&s;tified the King's In&s;tructions, but voted the execution in <HI>Glencoe,</HI> to have been a barbarous Ma&s;&s;acre, and that it was pu&s;hed on by the Se|cretary of <HI>State</HI>'s Letters, beyond the King's Orders: Upon that, they voted an Addre&s;s to be made to the King, that he, and others concerned in that matter, might be proceeded again&s;t ac|cording to Law: This was carried by a great Majority.</P>
<P>In this Se&s;&s;ion, an Act pa&s;t, in favour of &s;uch of the Epi&s;|copal Clergy, as &s;hould enter into tho&s;e engagements to the King, that were by Law required; That they &s;hould continue in their Benefices under the King's Protection, without being &s;ubject to the power of Presbytery. This was carried with &s;ome addre&s;s, before the Presbyterians were aware of the con&s;equences of it; for it was plainly that which they call <HI>Era&s;tiani&s;m.</HI> A day was limited to the Clergy for taking the Oaths: And by a very zealous and dextrous management, about &s;eventy of the be&s;t of them were brought to take the Oaths to the King;
<PB N="158" REF="179">
And &s;o they came within the Protection promi&s;ed them by the Act.</P>
<P>Another Act pa&s;&s;ed, that has already produced very fatal con&s;equences to that Kingdom, and may yet draw wor&s;e <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Act for a new Com|pany.</NOTE> after it: The Interlopers in the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade, finding that the Company was like to be favoured by the Parlia|ment, as well as by the Court, were re&s;olved to try other me|thods to break in upon that Trade: They entred into a Treaty with &s;ome Merchants in <HI>Scotland;</HI> And they had, in the former Se&s;&s;ion, procured an Act, that promi&s;ed Letters Patents to all &s;uch, as &s;hould offer to &s;et up new Manufactures, or drive any new Trade, not yet practi&s;ed by that Kingdom, with an ex|emption for twenty one years from all Taxes and Cu&s;toms, and with all &s;uch other Privileges, as &s;hould be found nece&s;&s;ary for e&s;tabli&s;hing or encouraging &s;uch projects. But here was a ne|ce&s;&s;ity of procuring Letters Patents, which they knew the cre|dit, that the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company had at Court, would certain|ly render ineffectual. So they were now in treaty for a new Act, which &s;hould free them from that difficulty. There was one <HI>Pater&s;on,</HI> a man of no education, but of great Notions; which, as was generally &s;aid, he had learned from the <HI>Buc|caneers,</HI> with whom he had con&s;orted for &s;ome time. He had con&s;idered a place in <HI>Darien,</HI> where he thought a good Settle|ment might be made, with another over again&s;t it, in the <HI>South Sea;</HI> And by two Settlements there, he fancied a great Trade might be opened both for the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t-Indies;</HI> and that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the neighbourhood might be kept in great &s;ubjec|tion to them; So he made the Merchants believe, that he had a great &s;ecret, which he did not think fit yet to di&s;cover, and re&s;erved to a fitter opportunity; Only he de&s;ired, that the <HI>We&s;t Indies</HI> might be named in any new Act, that &s;hould be $span$red to the Parliament: He made them in general under|&s;tand, that he knew of a Country, not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by <HI>Spaniards,</HI> where there were rich Mines, and Gold in abundance. While th$span$ matters were in treaty, the time of the King's giving the In$span$uctions to his Commi&s;&s;ioner for the Parliament came on; $span$d it had been a thing of cour&s;e, to give a general In&s;truc|tion, to pa&s;s all Bills for the encouragement of Trade. <HI>John|$span$</HI> told the King, that he heard there was a &s;ecret manage|$span$ among the Merchants for an Act in <HI>Scotland,</HI> under which the <HI>$word$ India</HI> Trade might be &s;et up; So he propo&s;ed, and drew $word$ In&s;truction, impowering the Commi&s;&s;ioner to pa&s;s any Bill, promi&s;ing Letters Patents for encouraging of Trade, $word$ $word$, $word$ that it &s;hould not interfere with the Trade of

<HI>England:</HI> When they went down to <HI>Scotland,</HI> the King's Com|mi&s;&s;ioner either did not con&s;ider this, or had no regard to it; for he gave the Royal A&s;&s;ent to an Act, that gave the Under|takers, either of the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> or <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Trade, all po&s;&s;i|ble privileges, with exemption of twenty one years from all Impo&s;itions: And the Act directed Letters Patents to be pa&s;&s;ed under the Great Seal, without any further Warrant for them: When this was printed, it gave a great alarm in <HI>England,</HI> more particularly to the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company; For many of the Merchants of <HI>London</HI> re&s;olved to join Stock with the <HI>Scotch</HI> Company; And the exemption from all Duties gave a great pro&s;pect of gain. Such was the po&s;ture of affairs in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Ireland,</HI> the three Lords Ju&s;tices did not agree long to|gether; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in <HI>Ireland.</HI></NOTE> The Lord <HI>Capel</HI> &s;tudied to render him&s;elf popular, and e&s;pou&s;ed the intere&s;ts of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> without any nice regard to ju&s;tice or equity: He was too ea&s;ily &s;et on, by tho&s;e who had their own end in it, to do every thing that gained him applau&s;e: The other two were men of &s;evere tem|pers, and &s;tudied to protect the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> when they were oppre&s;t; nor did they try to make them&s;elves otherwi&s;e popular, than by a wi&s;e and ju&s;t Admini&s;tration: So Lord <HI>Capel</HI> was highly magnified, and they were as much complained of, by all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in <HI>Ireland.</HI> Lord <HI>Capel</HI> did undertake to manage a Par|liament &s;o, as to carry all things, if he was made Lord Depu|ty, and had power given him to place and di&s;place &s;uch as he &s;hould name. This was agreed to, and a Parliament was held there, after he had made &s;everal removes: In the beginning of the Se&s;&s;ion, things went &s;moothly; The Supply that was asked, for the &s;upport of that Government, was granted; All the pro|ceedings in King <HI>James</HI>'s Parliament were annulled, and the great Act of Settlement was confirmed and explained, as they de&s;ired: But this good temper was quickly lo&s;t, by the heat of &s;ome, who had great credit with Lord <HI>Capel.</HI> Complaints were made of Sir <HI>Charles Porter,</HI> the Lord Chancellor, who was beginning to &s;et on foot a Tory humour in <HI>Ireland,</HI> whereas it was certainly the intere&s;t of that Government, to have no other divi&s;ion among them, but that of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> and of Prote&s;tant and Papi&s;t: Lord <HI>Capel</HI>'s Party, moved in the Hou&s;e of Commons, that <HI>Porter</HI> &s;hould be impeached; But the grounds, upon which this motion was made, appeared to be &s;o frivolous, after the Chancellor was heard by the Hou&s;e of Commons, in his own ju&s;tification, that he was voted clear from all imputation, by a Majority of two to one; This &s;et the Lord Deputy and the Lord Chancellor, with all the friends of both,
<PB N="160" REF="181">
at &s;o great a di&s;tance from each other, that it put a full &s;top, for &s;ome time, to all bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Thus Factions were formed in all the King's Dominions; And he, being for &s;o much of the year at a great di&s;tance from the &s;cene, there was no pains taken to quiet the&s;e, and to check the animo&s;ities which aro&s;e out of them. The King &s;tudied only to ballance them, and to keep up among the Parties, a jealou&s;y of one another, that &s;o he might oblige them all to depend more entirely on him&s;elf.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Campaign was over in <HI>Flanders,</HI> the King in|tended <NOTE PLACE="marg">A new Par|liament cal|led</NOTE> to come over directly into <HI>England;</HI> But he was kept long on the other &s;ide by contrary winds; The fir&s;t point, that was under debate upon his arrival, was, whether a new Par|liament &s;hould be &s;ummoned, or the old one be brought to|gether again, which by the Law that was lately pa&s;&s;ed, might &s;it till <HI>Lady-day:</HI> The happy &s;tate the Nation was in, put all men, except the Merchants, in a good temper; None could be &s;ure, we &s;hould be in &s;o good a &s;tate next year; So that now probably Elections would fall on men, who were well affected to the Government; A Parliament, that &s;aw it &s;elf in its la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion, might affect to be froward; The Members, by &s;uch a behaviour, hoping to recommend them&s;elves to the next Elec|tion; Be&s;ides, if the &s;ame Parliament had been continued, pro|bably the Enquiries into Corruption would have been carried on, which might divert them from more pre&s;&s;ing affairs, and kindle greater heats; all which might be more decently dropt by a new Parliament, than &s;uffered to lie a&s;leep by the old one. The&s;e con&s;iderations prevailed, tho' it was &s;till believed, that the King's own inclinations led him, to have continued the Parlia|ment yet one Se&s;&s;ion longer; For he reckoned, he was &s;ure of the major Vote in it. Thus this Parliament was brought to a Conclu&s;ion, and a new one was &s;ummoned.</P>
<P>The King made a progre&s;s to the North; And &s;taid &s;ome days at the Earl of <HI>Sunderland</HI>'s, which was the fir&s;t publick mark of the high favour he was in; The King &s;tudied to con|&s;train him&s;elf to a little more openne&s;s and affability, than was $word$ to him: But his cold and dry way had too deep a root, $word$ to return too oft upon him; The Jacobites were &s;o decried, $word$ few of them were elected; But many of the &s;ourer &s;ort of $word$ who were much alienated from the King, were cho&s;en: $word$, they were men of E&s;tates, but many were young, hot, and without experience. <HI>Foley</HI> was again cho&s;en Speaker; The demand of the Supply was &s;till very high, and there was
<PB N="161" REF="182">
a great arrear of Deficiencies; All was readily granted, and lodg|ed on Funds, that &s;eemed to be very probable.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of the Coin was con&s;idered, and there were great <NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;tate of the Coin rectified.</NOTE> and long Debates about the proper remedies: The motion of rai&s;ing the money above its intrin&s;ick value, was &s;till much pre&s;&s;ed; Many apprehended this matter could not be cured, without ca&s;ting us into great di&s;orders: Our money they thought would not pa&s;s, and &s;o the Markets would not be furni&s;hed; And it is certain, that if there had been ill humours then &s;tir|ring in the Nation, this might have ca&s;t us into great Convul|&s;ions. But none happened, to the di&s;appointment of our Ene|mies, who had their eyes and hopes long fixed on the effects, this might produce. All came in the end to a wi&s;e and happy re&s;olution, of Recoining all the Specie of <HI>England,</HI> in mill'd money; All the old money was ordered to be brought in, in publick Payments, or Loans to the Exchequer, and that by de|grees; fir&s;t the half Crown pieces, and the re&s;t of the money by a longer day; Money of a bad Allay, as well as clipt mo|ney, was to be received; tho' this was thought an ill precedent, and that it gave too much encouragement to fal&s;e Coining; Yet it was judged nece&s;&s;ary upon this occa&s;ion; And it gave a pre&s;ent calm to a ferment, that was then working all <HI>England</HI> over. Twelve hundred thou&s;and Pounds was given, to &s;upply the deficiency of the bad and clipt money. So this matter was hap|pily &s;ettled, and was put in a way to be effectually remedied, and it was executed with an order and a ju&s;tice, with a qui|et and an exactne&s;s, beyond all mens expectation. So that we were freed from a great and threatning mi&s;chief, without any of tho&s;e effects, that were generally apprehended from it.</P>
<P>The Bill of Trials in Ca&s;es of Trea&s;on, was again brought <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Act of Trials in Ca&s;es of Trea&s;on.</NOTE> into the Hou&s;e of Commons, and pa&s;&s;ed there; When it came up to the Lords, they added the Clau&s;e, for &s;ummoning all the Peers to the Trial of a Peer, which was not ea&s;ily carried; for tho&s;e, who wi&s;hed well to the Bill, looked on this as a device to lo&s;e it, as no doubt it was; And there|fore they oppo&s;ed it; But, contrary to the hopes of the Court, the Commons were &s;o de&s;irous of the Bill, that when it came down to them, they agreed to the Clau&s;e, and &s;o the Bill pa&s;&s;ed, and had the Royal A&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>A &s;evere Bill was brought in, for voiding all the Elections <NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts con cerning Elec|tions to Par|liament.</NOTE> of Parliament Men, where the Elected had been at any ex|pence in meat, drink, or money, to procure Votes: It was very &s;trictly penned; But time mu&s;t &s;hew, whether any eva|&s;ions can be found out to avoid it: Certainly, if it has the
<PB N="162" REF="183">
de&s;ired effect, it would prove one of the be&s;t Laws that ever was made in <HI>England;</HI> For abu&s;es in Elections were grown to mo&s;t intolerable exce&s;&s;es, which threatned even the ruin of the Nation. Another Act pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t unlawful and double Returns; For per&s;ons had been often returned, plainly contrary to the Vote of the Majority; and in Burroughs, where there was a con|te&s;t, between the &s;elect number of the Corporation, and the whole Populace, both &s;ides had obtained favourable deci&s;ions, as that &s;ide prevailed, on which the per&s;on elected happened to be; So both Elections were returned, and the Hou&s;e judged the matter. But by this Act, all Returns were ordered to be made, according to the la&s;t determination of the Hou&s;e of Commons: The&s;e were thought good Securities for future Par|liaments; It had been happy for the Nation, if the fir&s;t of the&s;e had proved as effectual, as the la&s;t was.</P>
<P>Great Complaints were made in both Hou&s;es of the Act for <NOTE PLACE="marg">Complaints of the <HI>Scotch</HI> Act.</NOTE> the <HI>Scotch Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company, and Addre&s;&s;es were made to the King, &s;etting forth the Inconveniencies that were like to ari&s;e from thence to <HI>England:</HI> The King an&s;wered, that he had been ill &s;erved in <HI>Scotland;</HI> But he hoped Remedies &s;hould be found, to prevent the ill con&s;equences, that they apprehended from the Act: And &s;oon after this, he turned out both the Secretaries of State, and the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Tweedale:</HI> And great Changes were made in the whole Mini&s;try of that Kingdom, both high and low. No Enquiry was made, nor proceedings ordered, concerning the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Glencoe;</HI> So that furni&s;hed the Li|bellers with &s;ome colours, in a&s;per&s;ing the King, as if he mu&s;t have been willing to &s;uffer it to be executed, &s;ince he &s;eemed &s;o unwilling to let it be puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>But when it was under&s;tood in <HI>Scotland,</HI> that the King had <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Scotland</HI> much &s;et on &s;upporting $word$</NOTE> di&s;owned the Act for the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company, from which it was expected that great Riches &s;hould flow into that Kingdom, it is not ea&s;y to conceive how great, and how general an in|dignation was &s;pread over the whole Kingdom; The Jacobites &s;aw what a Game it was like to prove in their hands; They played it with great skill, and to the advantage of their cau&s;e, in a cour&s;e of many years; and continue to manage it to this day: There was a great deal of noi&s;e made of the <HI>Scotch</HI> Act in both Hou&s;es of Parliament in <HI>England</HI> by &s;ome, who &s;eemed to have no other de|&s;ign in that, but to heighten our di&s;tractions, by the apprehen|&s;ions that they expre&s;&s;ed. The <HI>Scotch</HI> Nation fancied nothing but Mountains of Gold; And the credit of the de&s;ign ro&s;e &s;o high, that Sub&s;criptions were made, and advances of money were offered, beyond what any believed the Wealth of that King|dom
<PB N="163" REF="184">
could have furni&s;hed. <HI>Pater&s;on</HI> came to have &s;uch credit among them, that the de&s;ign of the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade, how promi&s;ing &s;oever, was wholly laid a&s;ide; And they re&s;olved to employ all their wealth, in the &s;ettling a Colony, with a Port and Fortifications in <HI>Darien,</HI> which was long kept a &s;ecret, and was only tru&s;ted to a &s;elect number, empowered by this new Company, who a&s;&s;umed to them&s;elves the name of the <HI>African</HI> Company, tho' they never meddled with any concern in that part of the World: The unhappy progre&s;s of this affair will ap|pear in its proper time.</P>
<P>The Lo&s;&s;es of the Merchants gave great advantages to tho&s;e, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A motion for a Coun|cil of Trade.</NOTE> who complained of the Admini&s;tration; The conduct, with re|lation to our Trade, was repre&s;ented as at be&s;t a neglect of the Nation, and of its Pro&s;perity: Some, with a more &s;piteful ma|lice, &s;aid, it was de&s;igned, that we &s;hould &s;uffer in our Trade, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> might carry it from us: And how extravagant &s;oever this might &s;eem, it was often repeated by &s;ome men of virulent tempers. And in the end, when all the errors, with relation to the protection of our Trade, were &s;et out, and much aggravated, a motion was made to create, by Act of Parlia|ment, a Council of Trade.</P>
<P>This was oppo&s;ed by tho&s;e, who looked on it, as a change of our Con&s;titution, in a very e&s;&s;ential point: The Executive part of the Government was wholly in the King: So that the appointing any Council, by Act of Parliament, began a Prece|dent of their breaking in upon the execution of the Law, in which, it could not be ea&s;y to &s;ee how far they might be car|ried; It was indeed offered, that this Council &s;hould be much limited as to its Powers; Yet many apprehended, that if the Par|liament named the per&s;ons, how low &s;oever their powers might be at fir&s;t, they would be enlarged every Se&s;&s;ion; and from being a Council to look into matters of Trade, they would be next empowered to appoint Convoys and Cruizers; This in time, might draw in the whole Admiralty, and that part of the Revenue or Supply, that was appropriated to the Navy; So that a King would &s;oon grow to be a Duke of <HI>Venice;</HI> And indeed tho&s;e, who &s;et this on mo&s;t zealou&s;ly, did not deny that they de&s;igned to graft many things upon it.</P>
<P>The King was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the ill effects this would have, that he ordered his Mini&s;ters to oppo&s;e it, as much as po&s;&s;ibly they could: The Earl of <HI>Sunderland,</HI> to the wonder of many, declared for it, as all that depended on him promoted it: He was afraid of the violence of the Republican Party, and would not venture on provoking them; The Mini&s;ters were much of|fended
<PB N="164" REF="185">
with him, for taking this method to recommend him|&s;elf at their co&s;t; The King him&s;elf took it ill, and he told me, if he went on, driving it as he did, that he mu&s;t break with him; He imputed it to his Fear; For the unhappy &s;teps he had made in King <HI>James</HI>'s time, gave his Enemies &s;o many handles and colours for attacking him, that he would venture on nothing, that might provoke them. Here was a Debate, plainly in a point of Prerogative, how far the Government &s;hould continue on its antient bottom of Monarchy, as to the Executive part; or how far it &s;hould turn to a Commonwealth; and yet by an odd rever&s;e, the Whigs, who were now mo&s;t em|ployed, argued for the Prerogative, while the Tories &s;eemed zealous for publick Liberty: So powerfully does intere&s;t bia&s;s men of all forms.</P>
<P>This was going on, and probably would have pa&s;t in both <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Con&s;pira|cy di&s;cover|ed.</NOTE> Hou&s;es, when the di&s;covery of a Con&s;piracy turned mens thoughts quite another way: So that all angry motions were let fall, and the Se&s;&s;ion came to a very happy conclu&s;ion, with greater advan|tages to the King, than could have been otherwi&s;e expected. We were all this Winter alarmed, from many different quar|ters, with the in&s;olent di&s;cour&s;es of the Jacobites, who &s;eemed &s;o well a&s;&s;ured of a &s;udden Revolution, which was to be both quick and entire; that at <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> they &s;aid, it would be brought about, within &s;ix weeks. The <HI>French</HI> Fleet, which we had &s;o long &s;hut up within <HI>Toulon,</HI> was now fitting out, and was ordered to come round to <HI>Bre&s;t;</HI> Our Fleet, that lay at <HI>Cadiz,</HI> was not &s;trong enough to fight them, when they &s;hould pa&s;s the Streights; <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> had come home, with many of the great Ships, and had left only a Squadron there; But a great Fleet was ordered to go thither; It was ready to have &s;ailed in <HI>De|cember;</HI> But was kept in our Ports by contrary Winds, till <HI>Fe|bruary;</HI> This was then thought a great unhappine&s;s; But we found afterwards, that our pre&s;ervation was chiefly owing to it; And it was &s;o extraordinary a thing, to &s;ee the wind fixed at South We&s;t during the whole Winter, that few could re&s;i&s;t the ob&s;erving a &s;ignal Providence of God in it. We were all this while in great pain for <HI>Rook,</HI> who commanded the Squadron that lay at <HI>Cadiz;</HI> and was like to &s;uffer for want of the Provi&s;ions and Stores, which this Fleet was to carry him, be&s;ides the addition of &s;trength this would bring him, in ca&s;e the <HI>Toulon</HI> Squadron &s;hould come about; We were only apprehen&s;ive of danger from that Squadron; For we thought, that we could be in none at home, till that Fleet was brought about; the adverti&s;ements came from many places, that &s;ome very important thing was ready to
<PB N="165" REF="186">
break out: It is true, the Jacobites fed their Party with &s;uch &s;tories every year; But they both talked and wrote now with more than ordinary a&s;&s;urance. The King had been &s;o accu&s;tomed to alarms and reports of this kind, that he had now &s;o little re|gard to them, as &s;carce to be willing to hearken to tho&s;e, who brought him &s;uch adverti&s;ements. He was &s;o much &s;et on pre|paring for the next Campaign, that all other things were little con&s;idered by him.</P>
<P>But in the beginning of <HI>February,</HI> one Captain <HI>Fi&s;her</HI> came <NOTE PLACE="marg">Of a&s;&s;$$$a|nating the King.</NOTE> to the Earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> and in general told him, there was a de&s;ign to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the King; But he would not, or could not then name any of the per&s;ons, who were concerned in it; He never appeared more, for he had a&s;&s;urances given him, that he &s;hould not be made u&s;e of as a witne&s;s; Few days af|ter that, one <HI>Pendergra&s;s,</HI> an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Officer, came to the Earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> and di&s;covered all that he knew of the matter; He freely told him his own name; but would not name any of the Con&s;pirators; <HI>La Rue,</HI> a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> came al&s;o to Bri|gadier <HI>Levi&s;on,</HI> and di&s;covered to him all that he knew; The&s;e two <HI>(Pendergra&s;s</HI> and <HI>La Rue)</HI> were brought to the King apart, not knowing of one another's di&s;covery: They gave an account of two Plots then on foot, the one for a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating the King, and the other for invading the Kingdom. The King was not ea&s;ily brought to give credit to this, till a variety of circum|&s;tances, in which the Di&s;coveries did agree, convinced him of the truth of the whole de&s;ign.</P>
<P>It has been already told, in how many Projects King <HI>James</HI> was engaged, for a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating the King; But all the&s;e had fail|ed; So now one was laid, that gave better hopes, and look'd liker a Military action, than a foul murder: Sir <HI>George Berkeley,</HI> a <HI>Scotchman,</HI> received a Commi&s;&s;ion from King <HI>James,</HI> to go and attack the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> in his Winter Quarters: <HI>Char|nock,</HI> Sir <HI>William Perkins,</HI> Captain <HI>Porter,</HI> and <HI>La Rue,</HI> were the men to who&s;e conduct the matter was tru&s;ted; The Duke of <HI>Berwick</HI> came over, and had &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e with them about the method of executing it: Forty Per&s;ons were thought ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the attempt; They intended to watch the King, as he &s;hould go out to hunt, or come back from it in his Coach; Some of them were to engage the Guards, while others &s;hould attack the King, and either carry him off a Pri&s;oner, or, in ca&s;e of any re&s;i&s;tance, kill him. This &s;oft manner was propo&s;ed, to draw Military men to act in it, as a warlike Exploit: <HI>Porter</HI> and <HI>Knightly</HI> went and viewed the Grounds, and the way thro' which the King pa&s;t, as he went between <HI>Ken&s;ington</HI> and <HI>Rich|mond</HI>
<PB N="166" REF="187">
Park, where he u&s;ed to hunt commonly on <HI>Saturdays;</HI> And they pitched on two places, where they thought they might well execute the de&s;ign. King <HI>James</HI> &s;ent over &s;ome of his Guards to a&s;&s;i&s;t in it; He &s;poke him&s;elf to one <HI>Harris</HI> to go over, and to obey &s;uch Orders as he &s;hould receive from <HI>Berke|ley;</HI> He ordered money to be given him, and told him, that, if he was forced to &s;tay long at <HI>Calais,</HI> the Pre&s;ident there would have orders to furni&s;h him.</P>
<P>When the Duke of <HI>Berwick</HI> had laid the matter &s;o well here, that he thought it could not mi&s;carry, he went back to <HI>France,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">And to $word$ $word$ $word$ the $word$.</NOTE> and met King <HI>James</HI> at St. <HI>Denis,</HI> who was come &s;o far on his way from <HI>Paris:</HI> He &s;topt there, and after a long Confe|rence with the Duke of <HI>Berwick,</HI> he &s;ent him fir&s;t to his Queen at St. <HI>Germains,</HI> and then to the King of <HI>France,</HI> and he him|&s;elf called for a Notary, and pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome Act: But it was not known to what effect. When that was done, he pur&s;ued his journey to <HI>Calais,</HI> to &s;et him&s;elf at the head of an Army of al out 20000 men, that were drawn out of the Garri&s;ons, which lay near that Frontier. The&s;e being full in that &s;ea&s;on, an Ar|my was in a very few days brought together, without any pre|vious warning or noi&s;e. There came every Winter a coa&s;ting Fleet, from all the Sea-ports of <HI>France</HI> to <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> with all the provi&s;ions for a Campaign; And it was given out, that the <HI>French</HI> intended an early one this year. So that this coa&s;ting $leet was ordered to be there by the end of <HI>January;</HI> Thus here were Tran&s;port Ships, as well as an Army, brought toge|ther in a very &s;ilent manner; There was al&s;o a &s;mall Fleet of $word$, and &s;ome Men of War ready to convoy them over; Many Regiments were embarked, and King <HI>James</HI> was wait|$ng a$ <HI>Cala$s,</HI> for &s;ome tidings of that, on which he chiefly $word$; For upon the fir&s;t notice of the &s;ucce&s;s of the A&s;&s;a&s;|$word$, he was re&s;olved to have &s;et &s;ail: So near was the mat|$span$ $word$ to a C$span$i&s;is, when it broke out by the di&s;covery, $span$ by the per&s;ons above named. <HI>La Rue</HI> told all particu|$span$, with the greate&s;t frankne&s;s, and named all the per&s;ons $span$ i$$ended to engage in the execution of it; For $span$, $word$ among them, and tho&s;e who concerted $span$ tho&s;e Li&s;ts given them; And took it for grant|ed, $span$ named in tho&s;e Li&s;ts was engaged; Since they were $span$ whom they depended, as knowing their $span$ that they would readily enter into the $span$ i$ $word$ not been, at that time, propo&s;ed to many of $span$.

They were ca&s;t into &s;everal parties, and an <HI>Aid de Camp</HI> was a&s;&s;igned to every one of them, both to bring them together, and to give the whole the air of a Military action: <HI>Pendergra&s;s</HI> owned very freely to the King, that he was engaged in intere&s;t again&s;t him, as he was of a Religion contrary to his; He &s;aid, he would have no Reward for his di&s;covery; But he hated a ba&s;e action; And the point of Honour was the only motive that prevailed on him: He owned, that he was de&s;ired to a&s;&s;i&s;t, in the &s;eizing on him, and he named the per&s;on that was fixed on to &s;hoot him; He abhorred the whole thing, and immediately came to reveal it: His &s;tory did in all particulars agree with <HI>La Ruc</HI>'s; For &s;ome time he &s;tood on it, as a point of Honour, to name no per&s;on; But upon a&s;&s;urance given him, that he &s;hould not be brought as a witne&s;s again&s;t them, he named all he knew: The King ordered the Coaches and Guards to be made ready next morning, being the <HI>15th</HI> of <HI>February,</HI> and on <HI>Saturday,</HI> his u&s;ual day of Hunting: But &s;ome accident was pretended to cover his not going abroad that day; The Con&s;pirators conti|nued to meet together, not doubting but that they &s;hould have occa&s;ion to execute their de&s;ign the next <HI>Saturday;</HI> They had &s;ome always about <HI>Ken&s;ington,</HI> who came and went continually, and brought them an account of every thing that pa&s;t there; On <HI>Saturday,</HI> the <HI>22d</HI> of <HI>February,</HI> they put them&s;elves in a readine&s;s; And were going out to take the Po&s;ts a&s;&s;igned them; but were &s;urpri&s;ed, when they had notice that the King's Hunting was put off a &s;econd time; They apprehended, they might be di&s;covered: Yet as none were &s;eized, they &s;oon quieted them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Next night, a great many of them were taken in their beds: <NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ $word$ $word$ $word$ $word$ $word$.</NOTE> And the day following, the whole di&s;covery was laid before the Privy Council: At the &s;ame time, Advices were &s;ent to the King from <HI>Flanders,</HI> that the <HI>French</HI> Army was marching to <HI>Dun|kirk,</HI> on de&s;ign to invade <HI>England:</HI> And now, by a very hap|py Providence, tho' hitherto, a very unacceptable one, we had a great Fleet at <HI>Spith$$d,</HI> ready to &s;ail: And we had another Fleet, de&s;igned for the Summer's &s;ervice in our own Seas, quite ready, tho' not yet manned.

that in three days, <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> who was &s;ent to command, &s;tood over to the Coa&s;t of <HI>France,</HI> with a Fleet of above fifty Men of War. The <HI>French</HI> were amazed at this; And upon it, their Ships drew &s;o near their Coa&s;ts, that he dur&s;t not follow them in &s;uch &s;hallow Water, but was contented with breaking their De&s;ign, and driving them into their Harbours. King <HI>James</HI> &s;tayed for &s;ome weeks there. But, as the <HI>French</HI> &s;aid, his malignant Star &s;till bla&s;ted every project, that was formed for his Service.</P>
<P>The Court of <HI>France</HI> was much out of countenance with this <NOTE PLACE="marg">The de&s;ign of the Inva|&s;ion broken.</NOTE> di&s;appointment; for that King had ordered his de&s;ign of In|vading <HI>England,</HI> to be communicated to all the Courts, in which he had Mini&s;ters: And they &s;poke of it with &s;uch an air of a&s;&s;urance, as gave violent pre&s;umptions, that the King of <HI>France</HI> knew of the Con&s;piracy again&s;t the King's Per&s;on, and depended upon it; for indeed, without that, the De&s;ign was impracticable, con&s;idering how great a Fleet we had at <HI>Spit|head;</HI> Nor could any Men of common &s;en&s;e have entertained a thought of it, but with a view of the Confu&s;ion, into which the intended A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination mu&s;t have ca&s;t us. They went on in <HI>England,</HI> &s;eizing the Con&s;pirators; And a Proclamation was i&s;|&s;ued out, for apprehending tho&s;e that ab&s;conded, with a pro|mi&s;e of a thou&s;and Pound Reward, to &s;uch as &s;hould &s;eize on any of them, and the offer of a Pardon to every Con&s;pirator, that &s;hould &s;eize on any of the re&s;t: This &s;et all people at work, and in a few weeks, mo&s;t of them were apprehended; Only <HI>Berkeley</HI> was not found, who had brought the Commi&s;|&s;ion from King <HI>James,</HI> tho' great &s;earch was made for him. For, tho' the reality of &s;uch a Commi&s;&s;ion, was fully proved afterwards, in the Trials of the Con&s;pirators, by the Evidence of tho&s;e, who had &s;een and read it all written in King <HI>James</HI>'s own hand (&s;uch a Paper being too important to be tru&s;ted to any to copy) yet much pains was taken, to have found the very per&s;on who ws intru&s;ted with it: The Commi&s;&s;ion it&s;elf would have been a valuable piece, and &s;uch an Original, as was not to be &s;ound any where.</P>
<P>The Military Men would not engage on other terms; They thought, by the Laws of War, they were bound to obey all Orders, that run in a Military Stile, and no other; And &s;o they imagined, that their part in it was as innocent, as the going on any de&s;perate de&s;ign, during a Campaign: Many of them re|pined at the Service, and wi&s;hed that it had not been put on them; But, being commanded, they &s;ancied that they were lia|ble to no Blame nor In&s;amy, but ought to be treated as Pri&s;on|ers of War.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="190">
Among tho&s;e who were taken, <HI>Porter</HI> and <HI>Pendergra&s;s</HI> were brought in. <HI>Porter</HI> had been a vitious man, engaged in many ill things; and was very forward and furious in all their Con|&s;ultations: <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Porter</HI> di&s;|covered all.</NOTE> The Lord <HI>Cutts,</HI> who, as Captain of the Guards, was pre&s;ent, when the King examined <HI>Pendergra&s;s,</HI> but did not know his name, when he &s;aw him brought in, pre&s;&s;ed him to own him&s;elf, and the &s;ervice that he had already done; But he claimed the promi&s;e of not being forced to be a Wit|ne&s;s, and would &s;ay nothing: <HI>Porter</HI> was a man of plea&s;ure, who loved not the hard&s;hips of a Pri&s;on, and much le&s;s the &s;olemnities of an Execution; So he confe&s;&s;ed all: And then <HI>Pendergra&s;s,</HI> who had his dependance on him, freely confe&s;&s;ed likewi&s;e: He &s;aid, <HI>Porter</HI> was the man who had tru&s;ted him; He could not be an In&s;trument to de&s;troy him; Yet he lay under no obligations to any others among them. <HI>Porter</HI> had been in the management of the whole matter: So he gave a very copious account of it all, from the fir&s;t beginning. And now it appeared, that <HI>Pendergra&s;s</HI> had been but a very few days among them, and had &s;een very few of them; and that he came and di&s;covered the Con&s;piracy, the next day after it was opened to him.</P>
<P>When by the&s;e Examinations the matter was clear and unde|niable, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Both Hou&s;es of Parlia|ment enter into a volun|tary A&s;&s;ocia|tion.</NOTE> the King communicated it, in a Speech to both Hou&s;es of Parliament: They immediately made Addre&s;&s;es of Congra|tulation, with a&s;&s;urances of adhering to him again&s;t all his Ene|mies, and in particular, again&s;t King <HI>James;</HI> And after that, Motions were made in both Hou&s;es, for an A&s;&s;ociation, wherein they &s;hould own him as their Rightful and Lawful King, and promi&s;e faithfully to adhere to him again&s;t King <HI>James,</HI> and the pretended Prince of <HI>Wales;</HI> engaging at the &s;ame time to maintain the Act of Succe&s;&s;ion, and to revenge his Death on all who &s;hould be concerned in it. This was much oppo&s;ed in both Hou&s;es, chiefly by <HI>Seimour</HI> and <HI>Finch</HI> in the Hou&s;e of Commons, and the Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI> in the Hou&s;e of Lords: They went chiefly upon this, that <HI>Rightful</HI> and <HI>Lawful</HI> were words, that had been laid a&s;ide in the beginning of this Reign; that they imported one that was King by De&s;cent, and &s;o could not belong to the pre&s;ent King. They &s;aid, the Crown and the Prerogatives of it were ve&s;ted in him, and therefore they would obey him, and be faithful to him, tho' they could not acknow|ledge him their Rightful and Lawful King. Great exceptions were al&s;o taken to the word <HI>Revenge,</HI> as not of an Evangelical &s;ound; But that word was &s;o explained, that the&s;e were &s;oon cleared; <HI>Revenge</HI> was to be meant in a legal &s;en&s;e, either in the pro&s;e|cution

of Ju&s;tice at home, or of War abroad; And the &s;ame word had been u&s;ed in that A&s;&s;ociation, into which the Nation entred, when it was apprehended, that Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Life was in danger, by the practices of the Queen of <HI>Scots.</HI> After a warm Debate, it was carried in both Hou&s;es, that an A&s;&s;ocia|tion &s;hould be laid on the Table, and that it might be &s;igned by all &s;uch, as were willing of their own accord to &s;ign it; only with this difference, that in&s;tead of the words <HI>Rightful</HI> and <HI>Lawful</HI> King, the Lords put the&s;e words, That King <HI>Wil|liam</HI> hath the Right by Law to the Crown of the&s;e Realms, and that neither King <HI>James,</HI> nor the pretended Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> nor any other per&s;on, has any Right what&s;oever to the &s;ame. This was done, to &s;atisfy tho&s;e, who &s;aid, they could not come up to the words <HI>Rightful</HI> and <HI>Lawful;</HI> And the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> offering the&s;e words, they were thought to an&s;wer the ends of the A&s;&s;ociation, and &s;o were agreed to. This was &s;igned by both Hou&s;es, excepting only Four&s;core in the Hou&s;e of Commons, and Fifteen in the Hou&s;e of Lords: The A&s;&s;o|ciation was carried from the Hou&s;es of Parliament over all <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and was &s;igned by all &s;orts of people, a very few only excepted: The Bi&s;hops al&s;o drew a Form for the Clergy, ac|cording to that &s;igned by the Hou&s;e of Lords, with &s;ome &s;mall variation, which was &s;o univer&s;ally &s;igned, that not above an Hundred all <HI>England</HI> over refu&s;ed it.</P>
<P>Soon after this, a Bill was brought into the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, declaring all men incapable of publick Tru&s;t, or to &s;erve in Parliament, who did not &s;ign the A&s;&s;ociation; This pa&s;t with no con&s;iderable oppo&s;ition; for tho&s;e who had &s;igned it of their own accord, were not unwilling to have it made general; and &s;uch as had refu&s;ed it when it was voluntary, were re&s;olved to &s;ign it, as &s;oon as the Law &s;hould be made for it. And at the &s;ame time, an Order pa&s;t in Council, for reviewing all the Commi&s;&s;ions in <HI>England,</HI> and for turning out of them all tho&s;e, who had not &s;igned the A&s;&s;ociation, while it was volun|tary; Since this &s;eemed to be &s;uch a declaration of their Princi|ples and Affections, that it was not thought rea&s;onable, that &s;uch per&s;ons &s;hould be any longer, either Ju&s;tices of Peace, or De|puty Lieutenants.</P>
<P>The Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament was &s;oon brought to a conclu&s;ion. They created one Fund, upon which, two Millions and an half <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Fund up+on a Land Bank.</NOTE> were to be rai&s;ed, which the be&s;t judges did apprehend was neither ju&s;t nor prudent. A new Bank was propo&s;ed, called the Land Bank, becau&s;e the Securities were to be upon Land: This was the main difference between it, and the Bank of <HI>Eng|land:</HI>
<PB N="171" REF="192">
And by rea&s;on of this, it was pretended, that it was not contrary to a Clau&s;e in the Act for that Bank, that no other Bank &s;hould be &s;et up in oppo&s;ition to it. There was a &s;et of Undertakers, who engaged that it &s;hould prove effectual, for the Money for which it was given: This was chiefly managed by <HI>Foley, Harley,</HI> and the Tories; It was much laboured by the Earl of <HI>Sunderland;</HI> And the King was prevailed on to con|&s;ent to it, or rather to de&s;ire it, tho' he was then told by ma|ny, of what ill con&s;equence it would prove to his affairs: The Earl of <HI>Sunderland</HI>'s excu&s;e for him&s;elf, when the Error ap|peared afterwards but too evidently, was, that he thought it would engage the Tories in intere&s;t to &s;upport the Govern|ment.</P>
<P>After mo&s;t of the Con&s;pirators were taken, and all Examina|tions were over, &s;ome of them were brought to their Trials. <HI>Charnock, King,</HI> and <HI>Keys,</HI> were begun with: The De&s;ign was <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Charnock</HI> and others tried and executed.</NOTE> fully proved again&s;t them. <HI>Charnock</HI> &s;hewed great pre&s;ence of mind, with temper and good judgment, and made as good a defence as the matter could bear: But the proof was &s;o full, that they were all found guilty. Endeavours were u&s;ed to per&s;uade <HI>Charnock</HI> to confe&s;s all he knew; for he had been in all their Plots from the beginning: His Brother was employed to deal with him, and he &s;eemed to be once in &s;u&s;pence: But the next time that his Brother came to him, he told him, He could not &s;ave his own Life without doing that, which would take away the Lives of &s;o many, that he did not think his own Life worth it. This &s;hewed a greatne&s;s of mind, that had been very valuable, if it had been better directed. Thus this matter was under&s;tood at the time. But many years after this, the Lord <HI>Somers</HI> gave me a different account of it. <HI>Charnock,</HI> as he told me, &s;ent an Offer to the King, of a full di&s;covery of all their con&s;ultations and de&s;igns; and de&s;ired no pardon, but only that he might live in &s;ome ea&s;y pri&s;on; and if he was found to prevaricate, in any part of his di&s;covery, he would look for the execution of the Sentence: But the King apprehended, that &s;o many per&s;ons would be found concerned, and thereby be rendred de&s;perate, that he was afraid to have &s;uch a Scene opened, and would not accept of this offer. At his death, <HI>Charnock</HI> delivered a paper, in which he confe&s;&s;ed, he was engaged in a de&s;ign to attack the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Guards; But he thought him&s;elf bound to clear King <HI>James,</HI> from having given any Commi&s;|&s;ion to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him. <HI>King</HI>'s Paper, who &s;uffered with him, was to the &s;ame purpo&s;e; and they both took pains to clear all tho&s;e of their Religion, from any acce&s;&s;ion to it. <HI>King</HI>
<PB N="172" REF="193">
expre&s;&s;ed a &s;en&s;e of the Unlawfulne&s;s of the undertaking; But <HI>Charnock</HI> &s;eemed fully &s;atisfied with the lawfulne&s;s of it. <HI>Keys</HI> was a poor ignorant Trumpeter, who had his dependance on <HI>Porter,</HI> and now &s;uffered chiefly upon his Evidence, for which he was much reflected on: It was &s;aid, that Servants had often been Witne&s;&s;es again&s;t their Ma&s;ters, but that a Ma&s;ter's wit|ne&s;&s;ing again&s;t his Servant, was &s;omewhat new and extraor|dinary.</P>
<P>The way that <HI>Charnock</HI> and <HI>King</HI> took to vindicate King <NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$ them.</NOTE> <HI>James,</HI> did rather fa&s;ten the imputation more upon him; They did not deny, that he had &s;ent over a Commi&s;&s;ion to attack the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> which, as <HI>Porter</HI> depo&s;ed, <HI>Charnock</HI> told him he had &s;een; If this had been denied by a dying man, his la&s;t words would have been of &s;ome weight: But in&s;tead of denying that which was &s;worn, he only denied, that King <HI>James</HI> had given a Commi&s;&s;ion for A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination: And it &s;eems great weight was laid on this Word; for all the Con&s;pirators agreed in it, and denied that King <HI>James</HI> had given a Com|mi&s;&s;ion to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the Prince of <HI>Orange.</HI> This was an odi|ous word, and perhaps no per&s;on was ever &s;o wicked, as to order &s;uch a thing, in &s;o crude a manner: But the &s;ending a Commi&s;&s;ion, to attack the King's Per&s;on, was the &s;ame thing upon the matter; and was all that the witne&s;&s;es had depo&s;ed. Therefore their not denying this, in the terms in which the Witne&s;&s;es &s;wore it, did plainly imply a Confe&s;&s;ion that it was true. But &s;ome, who had a mind to deceive them&s;elves or others, laid hold on this, and made great u&s;e of it, that dying men had acquitted King <HI>James</HI> of the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination. Such &s;light colours will &s;erve, when people are engaged before-hand to believe, as their affections lead them.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>John Friend,</HI> and Sir <HI>William Perkins,</HI> were tried next. The fir&s;t of the&s;e had ri&s;en from mean beginnings to great cre|dit, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Friend</HI> and <HI>Perkins</HI> tri|ed and &s;uf|fered.</NOTE> and much wealth; He was employed by King <HI>James,</HI> and had all this while &s;tuck firm to his intere&s;ts: His Pur&s;e was more con&s;idered than his head, and was open on all occa|&s;ions, as the Party applied to him: While <HI>Parker</HI> was former|ly in the Tower, upon Information of an A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of the King de&s;igned by him, he furni&s;hed the money that corrupt|ed his Keepers, and helped him to make his e&s;cape out of the Tower: He knew of the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, tho' he was not to be an Actor in it: But he had a Commi&s;&s;ion for rai&s;ing a Regiment for King <HI>James,</HI> and he had entertained and payed the Offi|cers, who were to &s;erve under him: He had al&s;o joined with tho&s;e who had &s;ent over <HI>Charnock,</HI> in <HI>May</HI> 1695, with the Me&s;|&s;age
<PB N="173" REF="194">
to King <HI>James,</HI> mentioned in the account of the former year: It appearing now, that they had then de&s;ired an Inva|&s;ion with 8000 Foot, and 1000 Hor&s;e, and had promi&s;ed to join the&s;e with 2000 Hor&s;e, upon their landing. In this, the Earl of <HI>Ailesbury,</HI> the Lord <HI>Montgomery,</HI> Son to the Mar|qui&s;s of <HI>Powis,</HI> and Sir <HI>John Fenwick,</HI> were al&s;o concerned: Upon all this evidence, <HI>Friend</HI> was condemned, and the Earl of <HI>Ailesbury</HI> was committed Pri&s;oner to the Tower. <HI>Perkins</HI> was a Gentleman of E&s;tate, who had gone violently into the Pa&s;|&s;ions and Intere&s;ts of the Court, in King <HI>Charles</HI>'s time: He was one of the &s;ix Clerks in Chancery, and took all Oaths to the Government, rather than lo&s;e his Place: He did not only con&s;ent to the de&s;ign of A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, but undertook to bring five men, who &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t in it; And he had brought up Hor&s;es for that Service, from the Country; But had not nam|ed the Per&s;ons; &s;o this lay yet in his own brea&s;t: He him&s;elf was not to have acted in it, for he likewi&s;e had a Commi&s;&s;ion for a Regiment; And therefore, was to re&s;erve him&s;elf for that Service: He had al&s;o provided a &s;tock of Arms, which were hid under Ground, and were now di&s;covered: Upon this Evi|dence, he was condemned. Great endeavours were u&s;ed, both with <HI>Friend</HI> and him, to confe&s;s all they knew: <HI>Friend</HI> was more &s;ullen, as he knew le&s;s; for he was only applied to and tru&s;ted, when they needed his money: <HI>Perkins</HI> fluctuated more; He confe&s;&s;ed the whole thing for which he was condemned; But would not name the five per&s;ons, whom he was to have &s;ent in, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination; He &s;aid, he had engaged them in it, &s;o he could not think of &s;aving his own Life by de|&s;troying theirs: He confe&s;&s;ed, he had &s;een King <HI>James</HI>'s Com|mi&s;&s;ion; The words differed a little from tho&s;e which <HI>Porter</HI> had told; But <HI>Porter</HI> did not &s;wear that he &s;aw it him&s;elf; He only related what <HI>Charnock</HI> had told him concerning it; Yet <HI>Perkins</HI> &s;aid, they were to the &s;ame effect: He believed, it was all writ with King <HI>James</HI>'s own hand, he had &s;een his writing often, and was confident it was writ by him: He own|ed, that he had rai&s;ed and maintained a Regiment; But he thought he could not &s;wear again&s;t his Officers, &s;ince he him|&s;elf had drawn them into the Service; and he affirmed that he knew nothing of the other Regiments: He &s;ent for the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Ely,</HI> to whom he repeated all the&s;e particulars, as the Bi|&s;hop him&s;elf told me; He &s;eemed much troubled with a &s;en&s;e of his former Life, which had been very irregular: The Hou&s;e of Commons &s;ent &s;ome to examine him: But he gave them &s;o little &s;atisfaction, that they left him to the cour&s;e of the Law:
<PB N="174" REF="195">
His tenderne&s;s, in not accu&s;ing tho&s;e whom he had drawn in, was &s;o generous, that this alone &s;erved to create &s;ome regard for a man, who had been long under a very bad Character. In the beginning of <HI>April, Friend</HI> and he were executed toge|ther.</P>
<P>A very unu&s;ual in&s;tance of the boldne&s;s of the Jacobites ap|peared upon that occa&s;ion; The&s;e two had not changed their Religion, but &s;till called them&s;elves Prote&s;tants; So three of the Nonjuring Clergymen waited on them to Tyburn, two of them had been oft with <HI>Friend,</HI> and one of them with <HI>Perkins;</HI> And all the three, at the place of Execution, joined to give them <NOTE PLACE="marg">They had a publick Ab|&s;olution giv|en them.</NOTE> Publick Ab&s;olution, with an Impo&s;ition of Hands, in the view of all the People; A &s;train of Impudence, that was as new as it was wicked; &s;ince the&s;e per&s;ons died, owning the ill De|&s;igns they had been engaged in, and expre&s;&s;ing no &s;ort of Re|pentance for them. So the&s;e Clergymen, in this &s;olemn Ab&s;o|lution, made an open Declaration of their allowing and ju&s;ti|fying the&s;e per&s;ons, in all they had been concerned in: Two of the&s;e were taken, and cen&s;ured for this in the King's Bench, the third made his e&s;cape.</P>
<P>Three other Con&s;pirators, <HI>Rookwood, Lowick,</HI> and <HI>Cranborn,</HI> were tried next. By this time, the new Act for Trials in &s;uch <NOTE PLACE="marg">$para$</NOTE> ca&s;es began to take place, &s;o the&s;e held long; for their Council &s;tuck upon every thing. But the Evidence was now more co|pious: For three other Witne&s;&s;es came in; The Government being &s;o gentle as to pardon even the Con&s;pirators, who con|$span$d their guilt, and were willing to be Witne&s;&s;es again&s;t o|thers. The two fir&s;t were Papi&s;ts, they expre&s;&s;ed their di&s;like o$ the De&s;ign; But in&s;i&s;ted on this, that as Military Men they were bound to obey all Military Orders; And they thought, that the King, who knew the Laws of War, ought to have a regard to this, and to forgive them. <HI>Cranborn</HI> called him&s;elf a Prote&s;tant, but was more &s;ullen than the other two; to &s;uch a degree of &s;ury and perver&s;ene&s;s, had the Jacobites wrought up their Party. <HI>Knightly</HI> was tried next; He confe&s;&s;ed all, and upon that, tho' he was condemned, he had a Reprieve, and was afterwards pardoned. The&s;e were all the Trials and Exe|cutions that even this black Con&s;piracy drew from the Govern|ment; for the King's Inclinations were &s;o merciful, that he &s;eemed unea&s;y even under the&s;e Acts of nece&s;&s;ary Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P><HI>Cook</HI> was brought next upon his Trial, on account of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">$para$</NOTE> intended Inva&s;ion; for he was not charged with the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ina|tion; His Trial was con&s;idered as introductory to the Earl of <HI>$span$bury</HI>'s; for the Evidence was the &s;ame as to both. <HI>Porter</HI>
<PB N="175" REF="196">
and <HI>Goodman</HI> were two Witne&s;&s;es again&s;t him; They had been with him at a meeting, in a Tavern in <HI>Leadenhall</HI> Street, where <HI>Charnock</HI> received In&s;tructions to go to <HI>France,</HI> with the Me&s;|&s;age formerly mentioned; All that was brought again&s;t this, was, that the Ma&s;ter of the Tavern, and two of his Servants &s;wore, that they remembred well when that Company was at the Ta|vern, for they were often coming into the Room where they &s;at, both at dinner time, and after it; and that they &s;aw not <HI>Good|man</HI> there, nay, they were po&s;itive, that he was not there. On the other hand, <HI>Porter</HI> depo&s;ed, that <HI>Goodman</HI> was not with them at dinner; but that he came to that Hou&s;e after dinner, and &s;ent him in a note; upon which he, with the con&s;ent of the Com|pany, went out and brought him in: And then it was certain, that the Servants of the Hou&s;e were not in that con&s;tant at|tendance; nor could they be believed in a negative, again&s;t po&s;itive evidence to the contrary. Their credit was not &s;uch, but that it might be well &s;uppo&s;ed, that, for the intere&s;t of their hou&s;e, they might be induced to make &s;tretches: The Evi|dence was believed, and <HI>Cook</HI> was found guilty, and condemn|ed; He obtained many &s;hort Reprieves, upon a&s;&s;urances that he would tell all he knew: But it was vi&s;ible he did not deal &s;incerely, his puni&s;hment ended in a Bani&s;hment. Sir <HI>John Fenwick</HI> was taken not long after, going over to <HI>France,</HI> and was ordered to prepare for his Trial: Upon which, he &s;eemed willing to di&s;cover all he knew: And in this, he went off and on, for he had no mind to die, and hoped to &s;ave him&s;elf by &s;ome practice or other: Several days were &s;et for his Trial, and he procured new delays, by making &s;ome new di&s;coveries: At la&s;t, when he &s;aw that &s;light and general ones would not &s;erve his turn, he &s;ent for the Duke of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> and wrote a Paper as a di&s;covery, which he gave him to be &s;ent to the King; And that Duke, affirming to the Lords Ju&s;tices, that it was not fit that Paper &s;hould be &s;een by any, before the King &s;aw it, the matter was &s;uffered to re&s;t for this time.</P>
<P>The Summer went over, both in <HI>Flanders</HI> and on the <HI>Rhine,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cam+paign be|yond Sea $eebly carri|ed on</NOTE> without any action: All the Funds given for this year's Service proved defective, but that of the Land Bank &s;ailed totally: And the credit of the Bank of <HI>England</HI> was much &s;haken. A|bout five Millions of clipt money was brought into the Exche|quer; And the lo&s;s that the Nation &s;uffered, by the recoining of the money, amounted to two Millions, and two Hundred Thou&s;and pounds. The Coinage was carried on with all po&s;|&s;ible ha&s;te; About eighty Thou&s;and pounds was coined every Week: Yet &s;till this was &s;low, and the new money was gene|rally
<PB N="176" REF="197">
kept up; &s;o that, for &s;everal months, little of it appeared. This &s;top in the free Circulation of money, put the Nation in|to great di&s;order: Tho&s;e who, according to the Act of Parlia|ment, were to have the fir&s;t Payments in Milled money, for the Loans they had made, kept their Specie up, and would not let it go, but at an unrea&s;onable advantage. The King had no money to pay his Army, &s;o they were in great di&s;tre&s;s, which they bore with wonderful patience: By this means, the King could undertake nothing, and was forced to lie on the defen&s;ive: Nor were the <HI>French</HI> &s;trong enough to make an Im|pre&s;&s;ion in any place; The King had a mighty Army, and was much &s;uperior to the Enemy; Yet he could do nothing; And it pa&s;&s;ed for a happy Campaign, becau&s;e the <HI>French</HI> were not able to take any advantage from tho&s;e ill accidents, that our want of Specie brought us under; which indeed were &s;uch, that nothing but the &s;en&s;e all had of the late Con&s;piracy, kept us quiet and free from tumults. It now appeared, what a &s;trange error the King was led into, when he accepted of &s;o great a Sum, to be rai&s;ed by a Land Bank: It was &s;carce ho|nourable, and not very &s;afe at any time; But it might have proved fatal at a time, in which, money was like to be much wanted, which want would have been le&s;s felt, if Paper Credit had been kept up: But one Bank working again&s;t another, and the Gold&s;miths again&s;t both, put us to great &s;treights: Yet the Bank &s;upplied the King in this extremity, and thereby con|vinced him, that they were his friends in affection, as well as intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;ecret practices in <HI>Italy</HI> were now ready to break out; The <HI>Pope</HI> and the <HI>Venetians</HI> had a mind to &s;end the <HI>Germans</HI> out <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Peace in <HI>Piedmont.</HI></NOTE> of <HI>Italy,</HI> and to take the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> out of the nece&s;&s;ity of depending on tho&s;e, they called Hereticks. The manage|ment in the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Ca&s;al</HI> looked &s;o dark, that the Lord <HI>Gallway,</HI> who was the King's General and Envoy there, did apprehend there was &s;omewhat my&s;terious under it. One &s;tep more remained, to &s;ettle the Peace there; for the Duke of <HI>Sa|voy</HI> would not own that he was in any Negotiation, till he &s;hould have received the advances of money, that were promi|&s;ed him from <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland;</HI> for he was much &s;et on the heaping of Trea&s;ure, even during the War; to which end, he had deba&s;ed his Coin, &s;o, that it was not above a &s;ixth part in intrin&s;ick value, of what it pa&s;&s;ed for. He was always be&s;et with his Prie&s;ts, who were perpetually complaining of the pro|gre&s;s, that Here&s;y was like to make in his Dominions; He had indeed granted a very full Edict, in favour of the <HI>Vaudois,</HI> re|&s;toring
<PB N="177" REF="198">
their former Liberties and Privileges to them, which the Lord <HI>Gallway</HI> took care to have put, in the mo&s;t emphatical words, and pa&s;t with all the formalities of Law, to make it as effectual, as Laws and Promi&s;es can be: Yet every &s;tep, that was made in that affair, went again&s;t the grain, and was ex|torted from him, by the interce&s;&s;ion of the King and the States, and by the Lord <HI>Gallway</HI>'s zeal.</P>
<P>In conclu&s;ion, the <HI>French</HI> were grown &s;o weary of that War, and found the Charge of it &s;o heavy, that they offered, not only to re&s;tore all that had been taken, but to demoli&s;h <HI>Pig|nerol,</HI> and to pay the Duke &s;ome Millions of Crowns; and to compleat the whole, that the Duke of <HI>Burgundy</HI> &s;hould mar|ry his Daughter: To this he con&s;ented; But to cover this De|fection from his Allies, it was further agreed, that <HI>Catinat</HI> &s;hould draw his Army together, before the Duke could bring his, to make head again&s;t him; And that he &s;hould be or|dered to attempt the Bombardment of <HI>Turin,</HI> that &s;o the Duke might &s;eem to be forced, by the extremity of his affairs, to take &s;uch conditions, as were offered him. He had a mind to have ca&s;t the blame on his Allies; But they had a&s;&s;i&s;ted him more effectually at this time, than on other occa&s;ions: A Truce was fir&s;t made, and that, after a few months, was turned into an entire Peace; One Article whereof was, that the <HI>Milaneze</HI> &s;hould have a neutrality granted them, in ca&s;e the <HI>German</HI> Forces were &s;ent out of <HI>Italy;</HI> All the <HI>Italian</HI> Princes and States concurred in this, to get rid of the <HI>Germans</HI> as &s;oon as was po&s;&s;ible; So the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> promi&s;ed to join with the <HI>French</HI> to drive them out. <HI>Valence</HI> was the fir&s;t place, that the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> attackt; There was a good Garri&s;on in it, and it was better provided, than the places of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> generally were: It was not much pre&s;&s;ed, and the Siege held &s;ome weeks, many dying in it. At la&s;t, the Courts of <HI>Vienna</HI> and <HI>Madrid</HI> accepted of the Neutrality, and engaged to draw the <HI>Germans</HI> out of the&s;e parts, upon an advance of money, which the Princes of <HI>Italy</HI> were glad to pay, to be delivered from &s;uch trouble&s;ome gue&s;ts.</P>
<P>Thus ended the War in <HI>Piedmont,</HI> after it had la&s;ted &s;ix years: <HI>Pignerol</HI> was demoli&s;hed; But the <HI>French,</HI> by the Trea|ty, might build another Fort at <HI>Fene&s;trella,</HI> which is in the middle of the Hills: And &s;o it will not be &s;o important as <HI>Pig|nerol</HI> was, tho' it may prove an unea&s;y neighbour to the Duke of <HI>Savoy.</HI> His Daughter was received in <HI>France</HI> as Dutche&s;s of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> tho' not yet of the Age of Con&s;ent: for &s;he was but ten years old.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="199">
Nothing of con&s;equence pa&s;&s;ed in <HI>Catalonia;</HI> The <HI>French</HI> went no further than <HI>Gironne,</HI> and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> gave them no di&s;turbance; Both the King and Queen of <HI>Spain</HI> were at this time &s;o ill, that, as is u&s;ual upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, it was &s;u&s;pected they were both poi&s;oned: The King of <HI>Spain</HI> relap&s;ed often, and at la&s;t, remain'd in that low &s;tate of health, in which he &s;eemed to be always rather dying than living. The Court of <HI>France</HI> were glad of his recovery; for they were not then in a condition, to undertake &s;uch a War, as the <HI>Dauphin</HI>'s Preten&s;ions mu&s;t have engaged them in.</P>
<P>In <HI>Hungary,</HI> the <HI>Turks</HI> advanced again towards <HI>Tran&s;ilva|nia,</HI> where the Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> commanded the Imperial Ar|my: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in <HI>Hungary.</HI></NOTE> The <HI>Turks</HI> did attack them, and they defended them&s;elves &s;o well, that, tho' they were beat, yet it co&s;t the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;o dear, that the Grand <HI>Signior</HI> could undertake nothing afterwards. The Imperiali&s;ts lo&s;t about 5000 men; But the <HI>Turks</HI> lo&s;t above twice that number; And the Grand <HI>Signior</HI> went back with an empty Triumph, as he did the former year: But ano|ther action happened, in a very remote place, which may come to be of a very great con&s;equence to him. The <HI>Mu&s;co|vites,</HI> after they had been for &s;ome years under the divided Mo|narchy of Two Brothers, or rather, of a Si&s;ter, who governed all in their Name, by the death of one of the&s;e came now under one <HI>Czar:</HI> He entered into an Alliance with the Empe|ror, again&s;t the <HI>Turks;</HI> and <HI>Azuph,</HI> which was reckon'd a &s;trong place, that commanded the mouth of the <HI>Tanais</HI> or <HI>Donn,</HI> where it falls into the <HI>Meotis-palus,</HI> after a long Siege, was taken by his Army. This opened the <HI>Euxine</HI> Sea to him; So that, if he be furni&s;hed with men, skilled in the building, and in the &s;ailing of Ships, this may have con&s;equences, that may very much di&s;tre&s;s <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and be in the end, fatal to that Empire. The King of <HI>Denmark</HI>'s Health was now on a decline; Upon which, the Duke of <HI>Hol&s;tein</HI> was taking advan|tage, and new di&s;putes were like to ari&s;e there.</P>
<P>Our affairs at Sea went well, with relation to Trade: All our Merchant Fleets came happily home; we made no con&s;i|derable <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs at Sea.</NOTE> Lo&s;&s;es; on the contrary, we took many of the <HI>French</HI> Privateers; they now gained little in that way of War, which in &s;ome of the former years, had been very advantageous to them. Upon the breaking out of the Con&s;piracy, Orders were &s;ent to <HI>Cadiz,</HI> for bringing home our Fleet; The <HI>Spaniards</HI> murmured at this, tho' it was rea&s;onable for us to take care of our &s;elves in the fir&s;t place. Upon that, the <HI>French</HI> Fleet was al&s;o ordered to come about; They met with rough Wea|ther,
<PB N="179" REF="200">
and were long in the pa&s;&s;age: So that if we had &s;ent a Squadron before <HI>Bre&s;t,</HI> we had probably made &s;ome con&s;iderable advantage; but the Fleet was &s;o divided, that Faction appeared in every order, and in every motion; Nor did the King &s;tudy enough to remedy this, but rather kept it up, and &s;eemed to think, that was the way to plea&s;e both Parties; but he found afterwards, that by all his management with the Tories, he di&s;gu&s;ted tho&s;e, who were affectionate and zealous for him; and that the Tories had too deep an alienation from him, to be overcome with good u&s;age: Their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions however to him gained their end, which was to provoke the Whigs to be pee|vi&s;h and unea&s;y. Our Fleet &s;ailed towards the I&s;le of <HI>Rhae,</HI> with &s;ome Bomb Ve&s;&s;els: Some &s;mall I&s;lands were burnt and plundered, as St. <HI>Martin</HI>'s was bombarded: The lo&s;s the <HI>French</HI> made, was not con&s;iderable in it&s;elf, but it put their affairs in great di&s;traction: and the charge they were at in defending their Coa&s;t, was much greater than ours in attacking it. This was the &s;tate of affairs in <HI>England,</HI> and abroad, during this Summer.</P>
<P><HI>Scotland</HI> was falling under great mi&s;ery, by rea&s;on of two <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> &s;ucce&s;&s;ive bad Harve&s;ts, which exhau&s;ted that Nation, and drove away many of their People; the greate&s;t number went over to <HI>Ireland:</HI> A Parliament was held at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and in a very thin Hou&s;e, every thing that was asked was granted: They were in a mi&s;erable condition, for two &s;uch bad years lay ex|tremely heavy on them.</P>
<P>This Summer, the <HI>French</HI> were making &s;teps towards a Peace; <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Treaty of Peace &s;et on foot by the <HI>French.</HI></NOTE> The Court was very unea&s;y under &s;o long and &s;o de&s;tructive a War; The Country was exhau&s;ted, they had neither men nor money: Their Trade was &s;unk to nothing, and publick Credit was lo&s;t: The Creation of new Offices, which always was con&s;idered as a re&s;ource, never to be exhau&s;ted, did not work as formerly; Few buyers or undertakers appeared: That King's health was thought declining; He affected &s;ecrecy and retirement, &s;o that both the temper of his mind, and the &s;tate of his affairs, di&s;po&s;ed him to de&s;ire a Peace. One <HI>Callieres</HI> was &s;ent, to make propo&s;itions to the States, as D' <HI>Avaux</HI> was pre&s;&s;ing the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> to offer his Mediation: The States would hearken to no propo&s;ition, till two Preliminaries were agreed to; The fir&s;t was, that all things &s;hould be brought back to the &s;tate, in which they were put, by the Treaties of <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Nimeguen.</HI> This imported, not only the re&s;toring <HI>Mons</HI> and <HI>Charleroy,</HI> but likewi&s;e <HI>Strasburg</HI> and <HI>Luxembourg,</HI> and that, in the &s;tate which they were in at pre&s;ent; The other
<PB N="180" REF="201">
Preliminary was, that <HI>France</HI> &s;hould own the King, when&s;oever the Peace &s;hould be concluded. The Emperor, who de&s;igned to keep off any Negotiation as much as po&s;&s;ible, moved that this &s;hould be done before the Treaty was opened: But the King thought the other was &s;ufficient, and would not &s;uffer the Peace to be ob&s;tructed, by a thing, that might &s;eem per&s;onal to him&s;elf. To all this, the Court of <HI>France,</HI> after &s;ome delays, con&s;ented; But that &s;pirit of Chicane and Inju&s;tice, that had reigned &s;o long in that Court, did &s;till appear in every &s;tep that was made: For they made u&s;e of equivocal terms, in every Pa|per that was offered in their name: The <HI>States</HI> had felt the ef|fects of the&s;e in former Treaties too &s;en&s;ibly, not to be now on their guard again&s;t them: The <HI>French</HI> &s;till returned to them, and when &s;ome points &s;eemed to be quite &s;ettled, new diffi|culties were &s;till thrown in. It was propo&s;ed by the <HI>French,</HI> that the Popi&s;h Religion mu&s;t continue &s;till at <HI>Strasburg,</HI> that the King of <HI>France</HI> could not in con&s;cience yield that point: It was al&s;o pretended, that <HI>Luxembourg</HI> was to be re&s;tored in the &s;ame &s;tate, in which it was when the <HI>French</HI> took it: The&s;e variations did almo&s;t break off the Negotiation; but the <HI>French</HI> would not let it fall, and yielded them up again: So it was vi|&s;ible all this was only an amu&s;ement, and an artifice, by this &s;hew of Peace, to get the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> to declare for it: Since as a Trading Nation mu&s;t grow weary of War, &s;o the Party they had among us, would join in with the inclina|tion, that was now become general to promote the Peace: For tho' our affairs were in all re&s;pects, except that of the Coin, in &s;o good a condition, that we felt our &s;elves grow richer by the War, yet during each Campaign, we ran a greater ri&s;que, than our Enemies did: For all our pre&s;ervation hung on the &s;ingle thread of the King's Life, and on that pro&s;pect, the Party, that wrought again&s;t the Government, had great hopes, and acted with much &s;pirit during the War, which we had rea&s;on to think mu&s;t &s;ink with a Peace.</P>
<P>The Parliament met in <HI>November;</HI> And at the opening of <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament in <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> the Se&s;&s;ion, the King, in his Speech to the two Hou&s;es, ac|quainted them with the Overtures, that were made towards a Peace: But added, that the be&s;t way to obtain a good one was, to be in a po&s;ture for carrying on the War. The great difficulty was, to find a way to re&s;tore Credit: There was a great Arrear due; All Funds had proved deficient; And the total failing of the Land Bank had brought a great confu&s;ion on all payments; The Arrears were put upon the Funds of the Re|venue, which had been granted for a term of but five years, and
<PB N="181" REF="202">
that was now ending; So a new continuance of tho&s;e Revenues was granted; and they were put under the management of the Bank of <HI>England,</HI> which upon that &s;ecurity, undertook the payment of them all. It was long before all this was fully &s;et|tled: The Bank was not willing to engage in it; yet at la&s;t it was agreed: And the Bank quickly recovered its Credit &s;o entirely, that there was no di&s;count upon the Notes. The Arrear amounted to ten Millions: And five Millions more were to be rai&s;ed for the Charge of the following year. So that one Se&s;&s;ion was to &s;ecure fifteen Millions, a Sum never before thought po&s;|&s;ible to be provided for, in any one Se&s;&s;ion. There was not Specie enough, for giving that quick circulation, which is ne|ce&s;&s;ary for Trade; So to remedy that, the Trea&s;ury was em|powered to give out Notes, to the value of almo&s;t three Milli|ons, which were to circulate as a Species of Money, and to be received in Taxes, and were to &s;ink gradually, as the money &s;hould ari&s;e out of the Fund, that was created to an&s;wer them; By the&s;e methods, all the demands, both for Arrears, and for the following year, were an&s;wered. The Commons &s;ent a Bill to the Lords, limiting Elections to future Parliaments, that none &s;hould be cho&s;en, but tho&s;e who had &s;uch a proportion of E&s;|tate or Money; The Lords rejected it: They thought it rea|&s;onable to leave the Nation to their freedom, in choo&s;ing their Repre&s;entatives in Parliament: It &s;eemed both unju&s;t and cruel, that if a poor man had &s;o fair a Reputation, as to be cho&s;en, notwith&s;tanding his Poverty, by tho&s;e, who were willing to pay him Wages, that he &s;hould be branded with an Incapacity, be|cau&s;e of his &s;mall e&s;tate. Corruption in Elections was to be apprehended from the rich, rather than from the poor. Ano|ther Bill was &s;ent up by the Commons, but rejected by the Lords, prohibiting the Importation of all <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Silks, and <HI>Bengales:</HI> This was propo&s;ed, to encourage the Silk Manu|facture at home; And Petitions were brought for it by great multitudes, in a very tumultuary way; But the Lords had no regard to that.</P>
<P>The great bu&s;ine&s;s of this Se&s;&s;ion, that held longe&s;t in both <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fenwick</HI>'s Bu&s;ine&s;s.</NOTE> Hou&s;es, was a Bill relating to Sir <HI>John Fenwick:</HI> The thing was of &s;o particular a nature, that it de&s;erves to be related in a &s;pe|cial manner; And the great &s;hare that I bore in the Debate, when it was in the Hou&s;e of <HI>Lords,</HI> makes it more nece&s;&s;ary for me copiou&s;ly to enlarge upon it: For it may at fir&s;t view, &s;eem very liable to exception, that a man of my Pro&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;hould enter &s;o far into a Debate of that nature. <HI>Fenwick,</HI> when he was fir&s;t taken, writ a Letter to his Lady, &s;etting forth his
<PB N="182" REF="203">
Misfortune, and giving him&s;elf for dead, unle&s;s powerful appli|cations could be made for him, or that &s;ome of the Jury could be hired to &s;tarve out the re&s;t; and to that he added, <HI>This or nothing can &s;ave my Life:</HI> This Letter was taken from the per|&s;on, to whom he had given it: At his fir&s;t Examination, be|fore the Lords Ju&s;tices, he denied every thing, till he was &s;hew|ed this Letter; and then he was confounded. In his private Treaty with the Duke of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> he de&s;ired an a&s;&s;urance of Life, upon his promi&s;e to tell all he knew; But the King re|fu&s;ed that, and would have it left to him&s;elf, to judge of the truth, and the importance of the di&s;coveries, he &s;hould make. So he re&s;olving to ca&s;t him&s;elf on the King's Mercy, &s;ent him a Paper, in which, after a bare account of the Con&s;ultations among the Jacobites (in which he took care to charge none of his own Party) he &s;aid, that King <HI>James,</HI> and tho&s;e who were employed by him, had a&s;&s;ured them, that both the Earls of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> and <HI>Marlborough,</HI> the Lord <HI>Godolphin,</HI> and Admiral <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> were reconciled to him, and were now in his Intere&s;ts, and acting for him. This was a Di&s;covery that could &s;ignify nothing, but to give the King a jealou&s;y of tho&s;e per&s;ons; For he did not offer the lea&s;t &s;hadow or circum&s;tance, either of proof or of pre&s;umption, to &s;upport this accu&s;ation. The King, not be|ing &s;atisfied herewith, &s;ent an Order for bringing him to a Trial, unle&s;s he made fuller Di&s;coveries: He de&s;ired to be fur|ther examined by the Lords Ju&s;tices, to whom he, being upon Oath, told &s;ome more Particulars; But he took care to name none of his own &s;ide, but tho&s;e again&s;t whom Evidence was already brought, or who were &s;afe and beyond Sea; Some few others he named, who were in matters of le&s;s Con&s;equence, that did not amount to High Trea&s;on; He owned a thread of Negotiations, that had pa&s;&s;ed between them and King <HI>James,</HI> or the Court of <HI>France;</HI> He &s;aid, the Earl of <HI>Ailesbury</HI> had gone over to <HI>France,</HI> and had been admitted to a private Au|dience of the <HI>French</HI> King, where he had propo&s;ed the &s;ending over an Army of 30000 Men, and had undertaken that a great Body of Gentlemen and Hor&s;es &s;hould be brought to join them: It appeared by his Di&s;coveries, that the Jacobites in <HI>England</HI> were much divided: Some were called Compounders, and others Noncompounders. The fir&s;t &s;ort de&s;ired Securities from King <HI>James,</HI> for the pre&s;ervation of the Religion and Liberties of <HI>England;</HI> whereas, the &s;econd &s;ort were for tru&s;ting him upon di&s;cretion, without asking any terms, putting all in his power, and relying entirely on his honour and genero&s;ity. The&s;e &s;eem|ed indeed to act more &s;uitably to the great Principle, upon

which they all in&s;i&s;ted, that Kings have their Power from God, and are accountable only to him for the exerci&s;e of it. Dr. <HI>Lloyd,</HI> the deprived Bi&s;hop of <HI>Norwich,</HI> was the only eminent Clergyman that went into this: And therefore, all that Party had, upon <HI>Sancroft</HI>'s Death, recommended him to King <HI>James,</HI> to have his nomination for <HI>Canterbury.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fenwick</HI> put all this in writing, upon a&s;&s;urance, that he &s;hould <NOTE PLACE="marg">Many de|lays.</NOTE> not be forced to witne&s;s any part of it. When that was &s;ent to the King, all appearing to be &s;o trifling, and no other proof being offered, for any part of it, except his own word, which he had &s;tipulated, &s;hould not be made u&s;e of, his Maje&s;ty &s;ent an Order to bring him to his Trial. But as the King was &s;low in &s;ending this Order, &s;o the Duke of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> who had been in the &s;ecret Management of the matter, was for &s;ome time in the Country: The Lords Ju&s;tices delayed the matter, till he came to Town: And then the King's coming was &s;o near, that it was re&s;pited till he came over. By the&s;e delays, <HI>Fenwick</HI> gained his main de&s;ign in them, which was to practi&s;e upon the Witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>His Lady began with <HI>Porter;</HI> He was offered, that if he <NOTE PLACE="marg">Practices upon Wit|ne&s;&s;es.</NOTE> would go beyond Sea, he &s;hould have a good Sum in hand, and an Annuity &s;ecured to him for his Life; He hearkned &s;o far to the propo&s;ition, that he drew tho&s;e, who were in Treaty with him, together with the Lady her&s;elf, who carried the Sum, that he was to receive, to a meeting, where he had provided Witne&s;&s;es, who &s;hould over-hear all that pa&s;&s;ed, and &s;hould, up|on a Signal, come in, and &s;eize them with the money; which was done, and a pro&s;ecution upon it was ordered. The prac|tice was fully proved, and the per&s;ons concerned in it were cen&s;ured, and puni&s;hed: So <HI>Porter</HI> was no more to be dealt with. <HI>Goodman</HI> was the other Witne&s;s; Fir&s;t they gathered matter to defame him, in which his wicked cour&s;e of Life fur|ni&s;hed them very copio&s;ly; But they tru&s;ted not to this me|thod, and betook them&s;elves to another, in which they prevail|ed more effectually; They per&s;uaded him to go out of <HI>Eng|land:</HI> And by this means, when the la&s;t Orders were given for <HI>Fenwick</HI>'s Trial, there were not two Witne&s;&s;es again&s;t him; So by the cour&s;e of Law, he mu&s;t have been acquitted: The whole was upon this kept entire for the Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament. The King &s;ent to the Hou&s;e of Commons the two Papers that <HI>Fen|wick</HI> had &s;ent him; <HI>Fenwick</HI> was brought before the Hou&s;e: But he refu&s;ed to give any farther account of the matter con|tained in them; So they rejected them as fal&s;e and &s;candalous, made only to create jealou&s;ies: And they ordered a Bill of At|tainder
<PB N="184" REF="205">
to be brought again&s;t <HI>Fenwick;</HI> which met with great oppo&s;ition in both Hou&s;es, in every &s;tep that was made. The Debates were the hotte&s;t, and held the longe&s;t, of any that ever I knew. The Lords took a very extraordinary method to force all their ab&s;ent Members to come up; They &s;ent Me&s;&s;engers for them to bring them up, which &s;eemed to be a great Breach on their Dignity; For the Privilege of making a Proxy was an un|doubted Right belonging to their Peerage; But tho&s;e, who in|tended to throw out the Bill, re&s;olved to have a full Hou&s;e. The Bill &s;et forth the Artifices, <HI>Fenwick</HI> had u&s;ed to gain de|lays; <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Bill of Attainder again&s;t <HI>Fen|wick.</HI></NOTE> and the practice upon <HI>Porter,</HI> and <HI>Goodman</HI>'s e&s;cape; the la&s;t having &s;worn Trea&s;on again&s;t him at <HI>Cook</HI>'s Trial, and likewi&s;e to the Grand Jury, who had found the Bill again&s;t him upon that Evidence. So now <HI>Porter</HI> appearing, and giv|ing his Evidence again&s;t him, and the Evidence that <HI>Goodman</HI> had given, being proved, it was inferred, that he was guilty of High Trea&s;on, and that therefore he ought to be Attainted.</P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;tance of the Arguments brought again&s;t this way <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rea&s;ons again&s;t it.</NOTE> of proceeding, was, that the Law was all Mens Security, as well as it ought to be their Rule: If this was once broke thro', no Man was &s;afe: Men would be pre&s;umed guilty without legal proofs, and be run down, and de&s;troyed by a torrent: Two Witne&s;&s;es &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary, by an indi&s;putable Law of Ju&s;tice, to prove a Man guilty: The Law of God given to <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> as well as the Law of <HI>England,</HI> made this nece&s;&s;ary: And, be&s;ides all former ones, the Law lately made for Trials in Ca&s;es of Trea&s;on, was &s;uch a &s;acred one, that it was to be hoped, that even a Parliament would not make a Breach upon it. A written Depo&s;ition was no Evidence, becau&s;e the Per&s;on accu&s;ed could not have the benefit of cro&s;s interrogating the Witne&s;s, by which much fal&s;e &s;wearing was often detected: Nor could the Evidence given in one Trial be brought again&s;t a Man, who was not a party in that Trial: The Evidence that was offered to a Grand Jury, was to be examined all over again at the Trial; Till that was done, it was not Evidence. It did not appear, that <HI>Fenwick</HI> him&s;elf was concerned in the practice upon <HI>Porter;</HI> What his Lady did, could not be charged on him: No Evidence was brought, that <HI>Goodman</HI> was practis'd on; So his withdrawing him&s;elf could not be charged on <HI>Fenwick.</HI> Some very black things were proved again&s;t <HI>Goodman,</HI> which would be &s;trong to &s;et a&s;ide his Te&s;timony, tho' he were pre&s;ent; And that proof, which had been brought in <HI>Cook</HI>'s Trial, again&s;t <HI>Porter</HI>'s Evidence, was again made u&s;e of, to prove that as he was the &s;ingle Witne&s;s, &s;o he was a doubtful and &s;u&s;pected
<PB N="185" REF="206">
one: Nor was it proper, that a Bill of this nature &s;hould begin in the Hou&s;e of Commons, which could not take Examinations upon Oath. This was the &s;ub&s;tance of the Arguments, that were urged again&s;t the Bill.</P>
<P>On the other hand, it was &s;aid, in behalf of the Bill, that <NOTE PLACE="marg">1697 Rea&s;ons for the Bill.</NOTE> the nature of Government required, that the Legi&s;lature &s;hould be recurred to, in extraordinary Ca&s;es, for which effectual Pro|vi&s;ion could not be made by fixed and &s;tanding Laws: Our Common Law grew up out of the Proceedings of the Courts of Law: Afterwards, This in ca&s;es of Trea&s;on was thought too loo&s;e, &s;o the Law in this point was limited, fir&s;t by the famous Statute in King <HI>Edward</HI> the Third's time, and then by the Statute in King <HI>Edward</HI> the Sixth's time; the two Witne&s;&s;es were to be brought face to face with the per&s;on accu&s;ed: And that the Law, lately made, had brought the method of Trials to a yet further cer|tainty; Yet in that, as well as in the Statute of <HI>Edward</HI> III. Parliamentary Proceedings were &s;till excepted; And indeed, tho' no &s;uch provi&s;ion had been expre&s;ly made in the Acts them&s;elves, the nature of Government puts always an exception, in favour of the Legi&s;lative Authority. The Legi&s;lature was indeed bound to ob&s;erve Ju&s;tice and Equity, as much, if not more, than the inferior Courts; Becau&s;e the Supreme Court ought to &s;et an Example to all others: But they might &s;ee cau&s;e to pa&s;s over Forms, as occa&s;ion &s;hould require; This was the more rea&s;on|able among us, becau&s;e there was no Nation in the World be|&s;ides <HI>England,</HI> that had not recour&s;e to Torture, when the Evi|dence was probable but defective: That was a mighty re&s;traint, and &s;truck a terror into all People; And the free&s;t Govern|ments, both antient and modern, thought they could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t without it. At pre&s;ent, the <HI>Venetians</HI> have their Civil Inqui&s;i|tors, and the <HI>Gri&s;ons</HI> have their High Courts of Ju&s;tice, which act without the Forms of Law, by the ab&s;olute Tru&s;t that is repo&s;ed in them, &s;uch as the <HI>Romans</HI> repo&s;ed in Dictators, in the time of their Liberty. <HI>England</HI> had neither Torture, nor any unlimited Magi&s;trate in its Con&s;titution; And therefore, upon great Emergencies, recour&s;e mu&s;t be had to the Supreme Legi|&s;lature. Forms are nece&s;&s;ary in &s;uborbinate Courts; But there is no rea&s;on to tie up the Supreme One by them: This me|thod of Attainder, had been practi&s;ed among us at all times; It is true, what was done in this way at one time, was often rever&s;ed at another; But that was the effect of the violence of the Times; and was occa&s;ioned often, by the inju&s;tice of tho&s;e Attainders: The Judgments of the inferior Courts were upon
<PB N="186" REF="207">
the like account often rever&s;ed; But when Parliamentary At|tainders went upon good grounds, tho' without ob&s;erving the Forms of Law, they were never blamed, not to &s;ay condemn|ed. When poi&s;oning was fir&s;t practi&s;ed in <HI>England,</HI> and put in a pot of Porridge in the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI>'s Hou&s;e, this, which was only Felony, was by a &s;pecial Law made to be High Trea&s;on; And a new Puni&s;hment was appointed by Act of Parliament: The Poi&s;oner was boiled alive. When the Nun of <HI>Kent</HI> pretended to Vi&s;ions, to oppo&s;e King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth's Divorce, and his &s;econd Marriage; and &s;aid, if he married again, he &s;hould not live long after it, but &s;hould die a Villain's death; This was judged in Parliament to be High Trea&s;on; And &s;he and her Accomplices &s;uffered accordingly. After that, there pa&s;&s;ed many Attainders in that Reign, only upon Depo|&s;itions, that were read in both Hou&s;es of Parliament: It is true, the&s;e were much blamed, and there was great cau&s;e for it; There were too many of them; For this extream way of pro|ceeding is to be put in practice but &s;eldom, and upon great occa&s;ions; Whereas, many of the&s;e went upon &s;light grounds, &s;uch as the uttering &s;ome pa&s;&s;ionate and indecent Words, or the u&s;ing &s;ome Embroidery in Garments and Coats of Arms, with an ill intent. But that, which was indeed execrable, was, that per&s;ons in Pri&s;on were attainted, without being heard in their own defence; This was &s;o contrary to natural Ju&s;tice, that it could not be enough condemned. In King <HI>Edward</HI> the Sixth's time, the Lord <HI>Seimour</HI> was attainted in the &s;ame manner, only with this difference, that the Witne&s;&s;es were brought to the Bar, and there examined; Whereas, formerly, they proceeded upon &s;ome Depo&s;itions, that were read to them: At the Duke of <HI>So|mer&s;et</HI>'s Trial, which was both for High Trea&s;on and for Felony, in which he was acquitted of the former, but found guilty of the latter, Depo&s;itions were only read again&s;t him; But the Witne&s;&s;es were not brought face to face, as he pre&s;&s;ed, they might be: Upon which it was, that the following Parliament enacted, that the Accu&s;ers (that is the Witne&s;&s;es) &s;hould be exa|mined face to face, if they were alive: In Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s time, the Parliament went out of the method of Law, in all the &s;teps of their Proceedings again&s;t the Queen of <HI>Scots;</HI> It is true, there were no Parliamentary Attainders in <HI>England,</HI> during that long and glorious Reign, upon which, tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed the Bill, in&s;i&s;ted much; Yet that was only, becau&s;e there then was no occa&s;ion here in <HI>England</HI> for any &s;uch Bill: But in <HI>Ire|land,</HI> where &s;ome things were notoriou&s;ly true, which yet could not be legally proved, that Government was forced to have, on
<PB N="187" REF="208">
many different occa&s;ions, recour&s;e to this method. In King <HI>James</HI> the Fir&s;t's time, tho&s;e who were concerned in the Gunpowder Plot, and cho&s;e to be killed, rather than taken, were by Act of Parliament, attainted after their death; which the Courts of Law could not do, &s;ince by our Law, a Man's Crimes die with him&s;elf; for this rea&s;on, becau&s;e he cannot make his own Defence, nor can his Children do it for him. The famous At|tainder of the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> in King <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t's time, has been much and ju&s;tly cen&s;ured; not &s;o much, becau&s;e it pa&s;t by Bill, as becau&s;e of the Inju&s;tice of it: He was accu&s;ed, for having &s;aid, upon the Hou&s;e of Commons refu&s;ing to grant the Sub&s;idies, the King had asked, <HI>That the King was ab&s;olved from all the Rules of Government, and might make u&s;e of force to &s;ubdue this Kingdom.</HI> The&s;e words were proved only by one Witne&s;s, all the re&s;t of the Council, who were pre&s;ent, depo|&s;ing, that they remembered no &s;uch Words, and were po&s;itive, that the Debate ran only upon the War with <HI>Scotland;</HI> So that tho' <HI>this Kingdom,</HI> &s;ingly taken, mu&s;t be meant of <HI>England,</HI> yet it might well be meant of <HI>that Kingdom,</HI> which was the Subject then of the Debate; Since then the words were capable of that favourable &s;en&s;e, and that both he who &s;poke them, and they who heard them, affirmed that they were meant and under&s;tood in that &s;en&s;e, it was a mo&s;t pernicious Precedent, fir&s;t to take them in the mo&s;t odious &s;en&s;e po&s;&s;ible, and then to de&s;troy him who &s;aid them, upon the te&s;timony of one &s;ingle exceptionable Witne&s;s; Whereas, if, upon the Commons refu|&s;ing to grant the King's demand, he had plainly advi&s;ed the King to &s;ubdue his people by force, it is hard to tell, what the Parliament might not ju&s;tly have done, or would not do again in the like ca&s;e. In King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second's time, &s;ome of the mo&s;t eminent of the Regicides were attained, after they were dead.; and in King <HI>James</HI>'s time, the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> was attainted by Bill: The&s;e la&s;t Attainders had their fir&s;t beginning in the Hou&s;e of Commons. Thus it appeared, that the&s;e la&s;t two hundred years, not to mention much ancienter Precedents, the Nation had upon extraordinary occa&s;ions proceded in this Par|liamentary way by Bill. There were already many Precedents of this method; And whereas it was &s;aid, that an ill Parlia|ment might carry the&s;e too far; It is certain, the Nation, and every Per&s;on in it, mu&s;t be &s;afe, when they are in their own hands, or in tho&s;e of a Repre&s;entative cho&s;en by them&s;elves: As on the other hand, if that be ill cho&s;en, there is no help for it; the Nation mu&s;t peri&s;h, for it is by their own fault; They have already too many Precedents for this way of proceeding,
<PB N="188" REF="209">
if they intend to make an ill u&s;e of them: But a Precedent is only a ground or warrant for the like proceeding, upon the like occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Two Rules were laid down for all Bills of this nature: Fir&s;t, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The grounds upon which &s;uch a Bill was nece&s;&s;a|ry and ju&s;t.</NOTE> that the Matter be of a very extraordinary nature: Le&s;&s;er Crimes had better be pa&s;&s;ed over, than puni&s;hed by the Legi&s;lature. Of all the Crimes, that can be contrived again&s;t the Nation, cer|tainly the mo&s;t heinous one is, that of bringing in a Foreign Force to conquer us: This ruines both Us, and our Po&s;terity for ever: Di&s;tractions at home, how fatal &s;oever, even tho' they &s;hould end ever &s;o tragically, as ours once did in the Murder of the King, and in a Military U&s;urpation, yet were capable of a Cri&s;is and a Cure. In the Year 1660, we came again to our wits, and all was &s;et right again; Whereas, there is no pro&s;|pect after a Foreign Conque&s;t, but of Slavery and Mi&s;ery: And how black &s;oever the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating the King mu&s;t needs appear, yet a Foreign Conque&s;t was wor&s;e, it was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating the King|dom: And therefore the inviting and contriving that, mu&s;t be the blacke&s;t of Crimes. But, as the importance of the matter ought to be equal to &s;uch an unu&s;ual way of proceeding, &s;o the certainty of the Facts ought to be &s;uch, that if the defects in Legal Proof, are to be &s;upplied, yet this ought to be done upon &s;uch grounds, as make the Fact charged appear &s;o evi|dently true, that tho' a Court of Law could not proceed upon it, yet no Man could rai&s;e in him&s;elf a doubt concerning it. Antiently, Trea&s;on was judged, as Felony &s;till is, upon &s;uch pre&s;umptions, as &s;atisfied the Jury: The Law has now limited this to two Witne&s;&s;es brought face to face; But the Parliament may &s;till take that liberty, which is denied to Inferior Courts, of judging this matter, as an ordinary Jury does in a ca&s;e of Felony. In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, there was one Witne&s;s, <HI>viva voce,</HI> upon who&s;e Te&s;timony, &s;everal Per&s;ons had been condemned, and had &s;uffered; And the&s;e neither at their Trial, nor at their Death, di&s;proved or denied any circum&s;tance of his Depo&s;itions. If he had been too much a Libertine in the cour&s;e of his Life, that did not de&s;troy his credit as a Witne&s;s: In the fir&s;t Tri|al, this might have made him a doubtful Witne&s;s; But what had happened &s;ince, had de&s;troyed the po&s;&s;ibility even of &s;u&s;|pecting his Evidence; A Party had been in intere&s;t concerned to enquire into his whole Life, and in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e had full time for it; And every circum&s;tance of his Depo&s;ition had been examined; and yet nothing was di&s;covered that could &s;o much as create a doubt; All was &s;till untouched, &s;ound and true. The only circum&s;tance in which the dying Speeches of
<PB N="189" REF="210">
tho&s;e who &s;uffer'd on his Evidence, &s;eemed to contradict him, was concerning King <HI>James</HI>'s Commi&s;&s;ion: Yet none of them denied really what <HI>Porter</HI> had depo&s;ed, which was, that <HI>Char|nock</HI> told him, that there was a Commi&s;&s;ion, come from King <HI>James,</HI> for attacking the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Guards: They on|ly denied, that there was a Commi&s;&s;ion for a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating him. Sir <HI>John Friend,</HI> and Sir <HI>William Perkins,</HI> were condemned, for the Con&s;ultation now given in Evidence again&s;t <HI>Fenwick:</HI> They died, not denying it; on the contrary, they ju&s;tified all they had done: It could not be &s;uppo&s;ed, that, if there had been a tittle in the Evidence that was fal&s;e, they &s;hould both have been &s;o far wanting to them&s;elves, and to their friends, who were to be tried upon the &s;ame Evidence, as not to have declared it in the &s;olemne&s;t manner: The&s;e things were more undeniably certain, than the Evidence of ten Witne&s;&s;es could po&s;&s;ibly be. Witne&s;&s;es might con&s;pire to &s;wear a fal&s;|hood; But in this ca&s;e, the Circum&s;tances took away the po&s;&s;i|bility of a doubt. And therefore, the Parliament, without tak|ing any notice of <HI>Goodman</HI>'s Evidence, might well judge <HI>Fen|wick</HI> guilty, for no Man could doubt of it, in his own mind.</P>
<P>The ancient <HI>Romans</HI> were very jealous of their Liberty; But how exact &s;oever they might be in ordinary Ca&s;es, yet when any of their Citizens &s;eemed to have a De&s;ign of making him|&s;elf King, they either created a Dictator to &s;uppre&s;s, or de&s;troy him, or el&s;e the People proceeded again&s;t him, in a &s;ummary way. By the <HI>Portian</HI> Law, no Citizen could be put to Death for any Crime what&s;oever; yet &s;uch regard did the <HI>Romans</HI> pay to Ju&s;tice, even above Law, that, when the <HI>Campanian</HI> Legion had perfidiou&s;ly broke in upon <HI>Rhegium,</HI> and pillaged it, they put them all to Death for it. In the famous ca&s;e of <HI>Catiline</HI>'s Con&s;piracy, as the Evidence was clear, and the Danger extream; The Accomplices in it, were executed, notwith&s;tanding the <HI>Por|tian</HI> Law: And this was done by the Order of the Senate, with|out either hearing them make their own Defence, or admit|ting them to claim the Right, which the <HI>Valerian</HI> Law gave them, of an Appeal to the People. Yet that whole Proceed|ing was chiefly directed by the two greate&s;t A&s;&s;erters of Publick Liberty, that ever lived, <HI>Cato</HI> and <HI>Cicero;</HI> And <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> who oppo&s;ed it, on pretence of its being again&s;t the <HI>Portian</HI> Law, was for that rea&s;on, &s;u&s;pected of being in the Con&s;piracy: It appeared afterwards, how little regard he had, either to Law or Liberty, though, upon this occa&s;ion, he made u&s;e of the one, to protect tho&s;e, who were in a Plot again&s;t the other. This
<PB N="190" REF="211">
Expre&s;&s;ion was much re&s;ented by tho&s;e, who were again&s;t this Bill, as carrying a bitter reflection upon them, for oppo&s;ing it.</P>
<P>In conclu&s;ion, the Bill pa&s;&s;ed, by a &s;mall Majority, of only <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bill pa&s;&s;ed.</NOTE> &s;even in the Hou&s;e of Lords; The Royal A&s;&s;ent was &s;oon given to it; <HI>Fenwick</HI> then made all po&s;&s;ible applications to the King for a Reprieve; And as a main ground for that, and as an article of merit, related how he had &s;aved the King's Life, two years before, as was already told in the beginning of the Year 1695. But as this Fact could not be proved, &s;o it could confer no obligation on the King, &s;ince he had given him no warning of his danger; And according to his own &s;tory, had tru&s;ted the Con&s;pirators words very ea&s;ily, when they promi&s;ed to pur&s;ue their de&s;ign no farther, which he had no rea&s;on to do. So that this preten&s;ion was not much con&s;idered; But he was pre&s;t to make a full Di&s;covery; And for &s;ome days, he &s;eemed to be in &s;ome &s;u&s;|pence, what cour&s;e to take. He de&s;ired to be &s;ecured, that nothing which he confe&s;t, &s;hould turn to his own prejudice; The Hou&s;e of Lords &s;ent an Addre&s;s to the King, intreating, that they might be at liberty to make him this Promi&s;e; And that was readily granted. He then farther de&s;ired, that, upon his making a full Confe&s;&s;ion, he might be a&s;&s;ured of a Pardon, without being obliged to become a Witne&s;s again&s;t any other Per&s;on: To this, the Lords an&s;wered, that he had to do with Men of Honour, and that he mu&s;t tru&s;t to their Di&s;cretion; that they would mediate for him with the King, in proportion as they &s;hould find his Di&s;coveries &s;incere and important: His behaviour to the King hitherto, had not been &s;uch, as to induce the Lords to tru&s;t to his Candour, it was much more rea&s;onable, that he &s;hould tru&s;t to them. Upon this, all hopes of any Di&s;coveries from him were laid a&s;ide. But a matter of another nature broke out, which, but for its &s;ingular Circum&s;tances, &s;carce de&s;erves to be mentioned.</P>
<P>There was one <HI>Smith,</HI> a Nephew of Sir <HI>William Perkins,</HI> who had for &s;ome time been in Treaty at the Duke of <HI>Shrews|bury</HI>'s <NOTE PLACE="marg">Practices again&s;t the Duke of <HI>Shrews|bury.</HI></NOTE> Office, pretending that he could make great Di&s;coveries, and that he knew all the motions and de&s;igns of the Jaco|bites: He &s;ent many dark and ambiguous Letters to that Duke's Under-Secretary, which were more properly to be called A|mu&s;&s;ments than Di&s;coveries; For he only gave hints and &s;craps of Stories; but he had got a promi&s;e not to be made a Witne&s;s, and yet he never offered any other Witne&s;s, nor told where any of tho&s;e, he informed again&s;t, were lodged, or how they might be taken. He was always asking more Money, and bragging
<PB N="191" REF="212">
what he could do, if he were well &s;upplied, and he &s;eemed to think he never had enough. Indeed, before the Con&s;piracy broke out, he had given &s;uch hints, that when it was di&s;cover|ed, it appeared, he mu&s;t have known much more of it, than he thought fit to tell. One Letter he wrote, two days before it was intended to have been put in Execution, &s;hewed, he mu&s;t have been let into the Secret very far (if this was not an arti|fice to lay the Court more a&s;leep) for he &s;aid, That as things ripened and came near execution, he &s;hould certainly know them better: It was not improbable, that he him&s;elf was one of the five, whom <HI>Perkins</HI> undertook to furni&s;h, for a&s;&s;i&s;ting in the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination; And that he hoped to have &s;aved him&s;elf by this pretended Di&s;covery, in ca&s;e the Plot mi&s;carried. The Duke of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> acquainted the King with his Di&s;coveries, but nothing could then be made either of them or of him. When the whole Plot was unravelled, it then was manife&s;t from his Letters, that he mu&s;t have known more of it, than he would own: But he &s;till claimed the Promi&s;e before made him, that he &s;hould not be a Witne&s;s. Upon the whole therefore, he rather de&s;erved a &s;evere Puni&s;hment, than any of tho&s;e Rewards, which he pretended to. He was accordingly di&s;mi&s;t by the Duke of <HI>Shrews|bury,</HI> who thought that even this &s;u&s;picious Behaviour of his did not relea&s;e him, from keeping the Promi&s;es he had made him. <HI>Smith,</HI> thereupon, went to the Earl of ^*^*^* and po&s;&s;e&s;t him with bad impre&s;&s;ions of the Duke of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> and found him much inclined to entertain them; He told him, that he had made great Di&s;coveries, of which that Duke would take no notice; And becau&s;e the Duke's ill Health had obliged him to go into the Country, two days before the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination was intended; He put this con&s;truction upon it, that he was willing to be out of the way, when the King was to be murthered. To fix this imputation, he &s;hewed him the Copies of all his Letters, all of which, but the la&s;t more e&s;pecially, had the face of a great Di&s;covery. The Lord ^*^*^* carried this to Court, and it made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion there, that the Earl of <HI>Portland</HI> &s;ent <HI>Smith</HI> Money, and entertained him as a Spy, but never could by his means learn any one real piece of Intelligence. When this happened, the King was ju&s;t going beyond Sea; So <HI>Smith</HI>'s Letters were taken, and &s;ealed up by the King's Order, and left in the hands of Sir <HI>William Trumball,</HI> who was the other Secretary of State. This matter lay quiet, till <HI>Fenwick</HI> began to make Di&s;coveries: And when Lord ^*^*^* under&s;tood, that he had not named him&s;elf (about which he expre&s;t too vehement a concern) but that he had named Lord <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI>
<PB N="192" REF="213">
it was &s;aid, that he entred into a Negotiation with the Dutch|e&s;s of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> that &s;he &s;hould, by <HI>Fenwick</HI>'s Lady, encourage him to per&s;i&s;t in his Di&s;coveries; And that he dictated &s;ome Papers to the Dutche&s;s, that &s;hould be offered to him, as an additional one; In which, many little &s;tories were related, which had been told the King, and might be believed by him; And by the&s;e, the King might have been di&s;po&s;ed to believe the re&s;t of <HI>Fenwick</HI>'s Paper; And the whole ended in &s;ome Di&s;cove|ries concerning <HI>Smith,</HI> which would naturally occa&s;ion his Let|ters to be called for, and then they would probably have had great effect. The Dutche&s;s of <HI>Norfolk</HI> declared, that he had dictated all the&s;e Schemes of his to her, who copied them, and handed them to <HI>Fenwick;</HI> And that he had left one Paper with her; It was &s;hort, but contained an Ab&s;tract of the whole de&s;ign, and referred to a larger one, which he had only dic|tated to her. The Dutche&s;s &s;aid, &s;he had placed a Gentle|woman, who carried her Me&s;&s;ages to <HI>Fenwick</HI>'s Lady, to over|hear all that pa&s;t; So that &s;he both had another Witne&s;s, to &s;upport the Truth of what &s;he related, and a Paper left by him with her. She &s;aid, that <HI>Fenwick</HI> would not be guided by him; And &s;aid, he would not meddle with contrived Di&s;|coveries: That thereupon this Lord was highly provoked; He &s;aid, if <HI>Fenwick</HI> would follow his Advice, he would certainly &s;ave him; But if he would not, he would get the Bill to pa&s;s. And indeed, when that matter was depending, he &s;poke two full hours in the Hou&s;e of Lords, in favour of the Bill, with a peculiar vehemence. <HI>Fenwick</HI>'s Lady, being much provok|ed at this, got her Nephew the Earl of <HI>Carlile,</HI> to move the Lords, that <HI>Fenwick</HI> might be examined, concerning any Ad|vices that had been &s;ent him, with relation to his Di&s;cove|ries: And upon this, <HI>Fenwick</HI> told what his Lady had brought him, and thereupon, the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Norfolk</HI> and her Confi|dent were likewi&s;e interrogated, and gave the account which I have here related: In conclu&s;ion, <HI>Smith</HI>'s Letters were read, and he him&s;elf was examined: This held the Lords &s;everal days; For the Earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> by the King's Orders, produc|ed all <HI>Smith</HI>'s Papers: By them it appeared, that he was a very in&s;ignificant Spy, who was always in&s;i&s;ting in his old &s;train of asking Money, and taking no care to de&s;erve it. The Earl of ^*^*^* was, upon the Accu&s;ation and Evidence above-men|tioned, &s;ent to the Tower, and turned out of all his Employ|ments. But the Court had no mind to have the matter far|ther examined into; For the King &s;poke to my &s;elf to do all I could, to &s;often his Cen&s;ure, which he afterwards acknowledg|ed
<PB N="193" REF="214">
I had done. I did not know what new &s;cheme of Confu|&s;ion might have been opened by him, in his own excu&s;e. The Hou&s;e of Lords was much &s;et again&s;t him, and &s;eemed re&s;olv|ed to go great Lengths: To allay that heat, I put them in mind, that he &s;et the Revolution fir&s;t on foot, and was a great promoter of it, coming twice over to <HI>Holland,</HI> to that end; I then moved, that he &s;hould be &s;ent to the Tower; This was agreed to, and he lay there till the end of the Se&s;&s;ion, and was removed from all his Places: But that lo&s;s, as was believ|ed, was &s;ecretly made up to him, for the Court was re&s;olved not to lo&s;e him quite.</P>
<P><HI>Fenwick</HI> &s;eeing no hope was left, prepared him&s;elf to die; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fenwick</HI>'s Execution.</NOTE> He de&s;ired the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of one of the deprived Bi&s;hops, which was not ea&s;ily granted; But in that, and in &s;everal other mat|ters, I did him &s;uch &s;ervice, that he wrote me a Letter of thanks upon it. He was beheaded on <HI>Tower-Hill,</HI> and died very compo&s;ed, in a much better temper, than was to be expected; For his Life had been very irregular. At the place of his Execution, he delivered a Paper in writing, wherein he did not deny the Facts, that had been &s;worn again&s;t him, but complained of the Inju&s;tice of the Procedure, and left his Thanks to tho&s;e, who had voted again&s;t the Bill. He owned his Loyalty to King <HI>James,</HI> and to the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> after him; But mentioned the De&s;ign of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating King <HI>Willi|am,</HI> in terms full of horror. The Paper was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been drawn by Bi&s;hop <HI>White,</HI> and the Jacobites were much provoked with the Paragraph, la&s;t mentioned. This was the conclu&s;ion of that unacceptable affair, in which I had a much larger &s;hare, than might &s;eem to become a Man of my Profe&s;|&s;ion: But the Hou&s;e of Lords, by &s;evere Votes, obliged all the Peers to be pre&s;ent, and to give their Votes in the matter: Since I was therefore convinced, that he was guilty of the Crime laid to his charge, and that, &s;uch a method of proceed|ing was not only lawful, but in &s;ome ca&s;es nece&s;&s;ary; And &s;ince, by the &s;earch I made into Attainders and Parliamen|tary Proceedings, when I wrote the <HI>Hi&s;tory of the Reformation,</HI> I had &s;een further into tho&s;e matters, than otherwi&s;e I &s;hould ever have done; I thought, it was incumbent on me, when my opi|nion determined me to the &s;everer &s;ide, to offer what Rea&s;ons occurred to me, in Ju&s;tification of my Vote. But this did not exempt me, from falling under a great load of Cen&s;ure, upon this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;oon as the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament was at <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in <HI>F$a$iers.</HI></NOTE> an end, the King went beyond Sea; The Summer pa&s;&s;ed over
<PB N="194" REF="215">
very quietly in <HI>England,</HI> for the Jacobites were now humble and &s;ilent. The <HI>French</HI> were re&s;olved to have Peace at any rate, by the end of the Year; They therefore &s;tudied to pu&s;h matters as far as po&s;&s;ible, during this Campaign, that they might obtain the better terms, and that their King might &s;till, to outward appearance, maintain a Superiority in the Field, as if nothing could &s;tand before him, and from thence might indulge his Vanity in boa&s;ting, that, notwith&s;tanding all his Succe&s;&s;es, he was willing to &s;acrifice his own advantages, to the quiet of <HI>Europe.</HI> The Campaign was opened with the Siege of <HI>Aeth;</HI> The Place was ill furni&s;hed, and the bad &s;tate, both of our Coin and Cre|dit, &s;et the King's Preparations &s;o far back, that he could not come in time to relieve it. From thence, the <HI>French</HI> were ad|vancing towards <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> on de&s;ign, either to take or bom|bard it. But the King, by a very happy diligence preventing them, po&s;&s;e&s;t him&s;elf of an advantageous Camp, about three hours before the <HI>French</HI> could reach it; by which they were wholly incapacitated to execute their De&s;ign. After this, there was no more Action in <HI>Flanders</HI> all the Summer; The re&s;t of the time was &s;pent in Negotiation.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> were more &s;ucce&s;sful in <HI>Catalonia;</HI> They &s;ent <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Barcelona</HI> taken by the <HI>French.</HI></NOTE> an Army again&s;t <HI>Barcelona,</HI> commanded by the Duke of <HI>Ven|dome,</HI> and their Fleet came to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance: The Garri&s;on was under the Command of a Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e,</HI> who had &s;erved in the King's Army, and, upon changing his Religion, was now at the head of the <HI>German</HI> Troops, that were &s;ent into <HI>Spain.</HI> The Viceroy (whether by a Fate common to all the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> or from a jealou&s;y, that the whole Honour would accrue to a Stranger, if the Place &s;hould hold out) &s;o entirely neglected to do his part, that he was &s;urprized, and his &s;mall Army was routed. The Town was large and ill fortified, yet it held out two Months, after the Trenches were opened: So that time was given to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> &s;ufficient to have brought Relief from the furthe&s;t corner of <HI>Spain:</HI> Nothing had happened, during the whole cour&s;e of the War, that did more evidently demon&s;trate the feeblene&s;s, into which that Monar|chy was fallen; For no Relief was &s;ent to <HI>Barcelona,</HI> &s;o that they were forced to Capitulate. By this, the <HI>French</HI> gained a great point; Hitherto, the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who contributed the lea&s;t towards carrying on the War, were the mo&s;t backward to all Overtures of Peace: They had felt little of the Mi&s;eries of War, and thought them&s;elves out of its reach: But now, <HI>France</HI> be|ing Ma&s;ter of &s;o important a Place, which cut off all their Com|munication
<PB N="195" REF="216">
with <HI>Italy;</HI> They became as earne&s;t for Peace, as they had hitherto been aver&s;e from it.</P>
<P>Nor was this all their Danger: A Squadron had been &s;ent, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A <HI>French</HI> Squadron in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI></NOTE> at the &s;ame time, to &s;eize on the Plate Fleet in the <HI>We&s;t-In|dies;</HI> The King ordered a Squadron, which he had lying at <HI>Ca|diz,</HI> to &s;ail after them, and a&s;&s;i&s;t the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> finding, that the Galleons were already got to the <HI>Havana,</HI> where they could not attack them, &s;ailed to <HI>Carthagena,</HI> which was in no condition to re&s;i&s;t them. The Plate had all been &s;ent away, before they came thither; But they landed and pillaged the Place, and then gave it out, that they had found many Millions there, which at fir&s;t &s;eemed incredible, and was afterwards known to be fal&s;e: Yet it was confidently a&s;&s;erted at that time, to cover the reproach of having mi&s;carried in the at|tempt, on which they had rai&s;ed great expectations, and to which many Undertakers had been drawn in. Our Squadron was much &s;uperior to theirs, yet never engaged them: Once indeed, they came up to the <HI>French,</HI> and had &s;ome Advantage over them; But did not pur&s;ue it. The <HI>French</HI> &s;ailed to the North, towards <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> where we had another Squa|dron lying, which was &s;ent with &s;ome Land Forces&punc; to reco|ver <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s Bay: The&s;e Ships might have fallen upon the <HI>French,</HI> and would probably have ma&s;ter'd them: But as they had no certain account of their &s;trength, &s;o being &s;ent out up|on another Service, they did not think it proper to hazard the attacking them: So the <HI>French</HI> got &s;afe home, and the Conduct of our affairs at Sea was much cen&s;ured: Yet our Admiralty de|clared them&s;elves &s;atisfied, with the account the Commanders gave of their Proceedings. But that Board was accu&s;ed of much partiality: On all &s;uch occa&s;ions, the unfortunate mu&s;t expect to be blamed, and to outward appearance, there was much room given, either to cen&s;ure the Orders, or the execution of them. The King owned, he did not under&s;tand tho&s;e matters: And <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> now made Earl of <HI>Orford,</HI> had both the Admi|ralty and the Navy Board, in a great dependance on him&s;elf; So that he was con&s;idered almo&s;t as much, as if he had been Lord High Admiral: He was too much in the power of tho&s;e, in whom he confided, and tru&s;ted them too far: And it was generally believed, that there was much Corruption, as it was certain there was much Faction, if not Treachery, in the conduct of our Marine. Our Mi&s;carriages made all people cry, that we mu&s;t have a Peace, for we could not manage the War to any good purpo&s;e; Since, notwith&s;tanding our great &s;uperiority at Sea, the <HI>French</HI> conducted their matters &s;o much better than
<PB N="196" REF="217">
us, that we were Lo&s;ers, even in that Element, where we u&s;ed to triumph mo&s;t. Our Squadron, in the Bay of <HI>Mexico,</HI> did very little &s;ervice; They only robbed and de&s;troyed &s;ome of the <HI>French</HI> Colonies; And that &s;ent to <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s Bay, found it quite abandoned by the <HI>French;</HI> &s;o that both returned home inglo|rious.</P>
<P>A great change of affairs happened this year in <HI>Poland:</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of <HI>Poland</HI>'s Death.</NOTE> Their King, <HI>John Sobieski,</HI> after he had long outlived the Fame he had got, by rai&s;ing the Siege of <HI>Vienna,</HI> died at la&s;t under a general contempt. He was going backwards and forwards, as his Queen's Negotiations in the Court of <HI>France</HI> were entertained or rejected: His Government was &s;o feeble and disjointed at home, that all their Diets broke up upon Preliminaries, before they could, according to their forms, enter upon bu&s;ine&s;s: He was &s;et on heaping up Wealth, which &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary to give his Son an intere&s;t in the &s;ucceeding Election. And upon his Death, a great party appeared for him, notwith&s;tanding the gene|ral aver&s;ion to the Mother: But the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Nobility re&s;olved to make no ha&s;te with their Election, they plainly &s;et the Crown to Sale; And encouraged all Candidates that would bid for it; One Party declared for the Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> of which their Pri|mate, then a Cardinal, was the Head; The Emperor did all he could to &s;upport the late King's Son; but when he &s;aw the <HI>French</HI> Party were too &s;trong for him, he was willing to join with any other Pretender.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Baden,</HI> and Don <HI>Li|vio Ode&s;chalchi,</HI> Pope <HI>Innocent</HI>'s Nephew, were all named; But <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Elector of <HI>Saxony</HI> cho&s;en King of <HI>Poland.</HI></NOTE> the&s;e not being likely to &s;ucceed, a Negotiation was &s;ecretly ma|naged with the Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> which &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that he was prevailed on to change his Religion, to advance his Troops towards the Frontier of <HI>Poland,</HI> to di&s;tribute Eight Millions of Florins among the <HI>Poles,</HI> and to promi&s;e to con|firm all their Privileges, and in particular, to undertake the Siege of <HI>Caminieck.</HI> He con&s;ented to all this, and declared him&s;elf a Candidate, a very few Days before the Election; And &s;o he was &s;et up by the Imperiali&s;ts, in oppo&s;ition to the <HI>French</HI> Party: His Party became quickly &s;o &s;trong, that tho', upon the fir&s;t appearance at the Election, while every one of the Competitors was trying his &s;trength, the <HI>French</HI> Party was the &s;tronge&s;t, and was &s;o declared by the Cardinal; yet when the other Pretenders &s;aw, that they could not carry the Elec|tion for them&s;elves, they united in oppo&s;ition to the <HI>French</HI> In|tere&s;t, and gave over all their Voices to the Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> by which his Party became much the &s;tronge&s;t, &s;o he was
<PB N="197" REF="218">
proclaimed the Elected King. The Cardinal gave notice to the Court of <HI>France,</HI> of what had been done in favour of the Prince of <HI>Conti;</HI> and de&s;ired that he might be &s;ent quickly thi|ther, well furni&s;hed with Arms and Ammunition, but chiefly with Money. But the Party for <HI>Saxony</HI> made more di&s;patch; that Elector lay nearer, and had both his Money and Troops ready, &s;o he took the Oaths that were required, and got the Change of his Religion to be atte&s;ted by the Imperial Court: He made all the ha&s;tate he could with his Army to <HI>Cracow,</HI> and he was &s;oon after Crowned, to the great joy of the Imperial Party, but the unexpre&s;&s;ible trouble of all his Subjects in <HI>Saxony.</HI></P>
<P>The Secular Men, there &s;aw, that the &s;upporting this Elec|tive Crown, would ruin his Hereditary Dominions: And tho&s;e, who laid the concerns of the Prote&s;tant Religion to heart, were much more troubled, when they &s;aw that Hou&s;e, under who&s;e Protection their Religion grew up at fir&s;t, now fall off to Po|pery. It is true, the pre&s;ent Family, ever &s;ince <HI>Maurice</HI>'s time, had &s;hewed very little zeal in that Cau&s;e: The Elected King had &s;o &s;mall a &s;hare of Religion in him&s;elf, that little was to be expected from him: Nor was it much apprehended that he would become a Bigot, or turn a Per&s;ecutor: But &s;uch was the eagerne&s;s of the Popi&s;h Clergy, toward the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing what they call Here&s;y, and the perpetual jealou&s;ies, with which there|fore they would po&s;&s;e&s;s the <HI>Poles,</HI> were like to be &s;uch, in ca&s;e he u&s;ed no violence towards his <HI>Saxon</HI> Subjects, as po&s;&s;ibly might have great effects on him; &s;o that it is no wonder, if they were &s;truck with a general Con&s;ternation, upon his revolt. His Electore&s;s, tho' a very young per&s;on, de&s;cended of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Brandenbourg,</HI> expre&s;&s;ed &s;o extraordinary a mea&s;ure of zeal and piety upon this occa&s;ion, that it contributed much to the pre&s;ent quieting of their fears: The new King &s;ent a Po|pi&s;h Statholder to <HI>Dre&s;den,</HI> but &s;o weak a Man, that there was no rea&s;on to apprehend much from any conduct of his.

He &s;ent an Emba&s;&s;y to <HI>Holland,</HI> to regulate &s;ome matters of Commerce, and to &s;ee if they would a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the War, he was de&s;igning again&s;t the <HI>Turk;</HI> When the Amba&s;&s;adors were &s;et out, he &s;ettled his Af|fairs in &s;uch hands, as he tru&s;ted mo&s;t to, and with a &s;mall re|tinue of two or three Servants, he &s;ecretly followed his Amba&s;|&s;adors, and quickly overtook them; He di&s;covered him&s;elf fir&s;t to the Elector of <HI>Brandenbourg,</HI> who was then in <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> look|ing on the Di&s;pute, that was like to ari&s;e in <HI>Poland,</HI> in which, if a War &s;hould follow, he might be forced to have a &s;hare: The <HI>Czar</HI> concerned him&s;elf much in the matter, not only by rea&s;on of the Neighbourhood, but becau&s;e he &s;eared, that if the <HI>French</HI> Party &s;hould prevail, <HI>France</HI> being in an Alliance with the <HI>Turk,</HI> a King &s;ent from thence would probably, not only make a Peace with the <HI>Turk,</HI> but turn his Arms again&s;t him&s;elf, which would hinder all his De&s;igns for a great Fleet.

<P>The Negotiation for a Peace was held at <HI>Ry&s;wick,</HI> a Hou&s;e of the King's, between the <HI>Hague</HI> and <HI>Delft.</HI> The chief of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Treaty at <HI>Ry&s;wick.</HI></NOTE> our Plenipotentiaries was the Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> a Man of emi|nent Virtue, and of great and profound Learning, particularly in the Mathematicks: This made him a little too &s;peculative and ab&s;tracted in his Notions; He had great application, but he lived a little too much out of the World, tho' in a publick Station; a little more practice among Men, would give him the la&s;t fini&s;hing: There was &s;omewhat, in his per&s;on and manner, that created him an univer&s;al re&s;pect; for we had no Man among us, whom all &s;ides loved and honoured &s;o much, as they did him: There were two others joined with him in that Em|ba&s;&s;y.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Sweden</HI> was received as Mediator, but he died before any progre&s;s was made in the Treaty: His Son, who <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of <HI>Sweden</HI>'s Death.

The Father was a rough and boi&s;terous Man; He loved fatigue, and was free from Vice; He reduced his Kingdom to a Military State, and was ever going round it, to &s;ee how his Troops were ordered, and his Di&s;cipline ob&s;erv|ed: He looked narrowly into the whole Admini&s;tration; He had quite altered the Con&s;titution of his Kingdom; It was for|merly changed from being an Elective, to be a Hereditary King|dom, yet till his time, it had continued to be rather an Ari|&s;tocracy, than a Monarchy; But he got the Power of the Se|nators to be quite taken away, &s;o that it was left free to him, to make u&s;e of &s;uch Coun&s;ellors as he &s;hould choo&s;e; The Se|nators had enriched them&s;elves, and oppre&s;&s;ed the People; They had devoured the Revenues of the Crown, and in two Reigns,

in which the Sovereign was long in a &s;tate of Infancy, both in Queen <HI>Chri&s;tina</HI>'s and in this King's time, the Senators had taken care of them&s;elves, and had &s;tripped the Crown. So the King moved for a general Re&s;umption, and this he obtained ea&s;ily of the States: Who, as they envied the Wealth of the Senators, &s;o they hoped that, by making the King rich, the Peo|ple would be le&s;s charged with Taxes; This was not all; He got likewi&s;e an Act of Revi&s;ion, by which tho&s;e who had Grants were to account for the mean profits, and this was applied even to tho&s;e who had Grants upon valuable Con&s;iderations; for when it appeared, that the valuable Con&s;ideration was &s;atisfied, they were to account for all they had received over and above that, and to repay this, with the intere&s;t of the Money, at 12 <HI>per Cent.</HI> for all the Years they had enjoyed it. This brought a great Debt on all the Senators and other Families of the King|dom, it did utterly ruin them and left them at Mercy; And when the King took from them all they had, he kept them &s;till in a dependance upon him, giving them Imployments in the Army or Militia that he &s;et up.</P>
<P>After that, he procured of the States of his Kingdom, an ab&s;olute Authority to govern them as he thought fit, and ac|cording to Law; But even this limitation &s;eemed unea&s;y, and their Slavery was fini&s;hed by another Act, which he obtained, that he &s;hould not be obliged to govern by Law, but by his meer Will and Plea&s;ure: So &s;ucce&s;sful was he, in the &s;pace of five Years, to ruin all the Families in his Kingdom, and to de&s;troy their Laws and Liberties, and that by their own con|&s;ent: He died when his Son was but fifteen years old, and gave great hopes of being an active, warlike, and indefatiga|ble Prince, which his Reign ever &s;ince has demon&s;trated to the World.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t act of his Reign, was the Mediation at <HI>Ry&s;wick,</HI> where the Treaty went on but &s;lowly, till <HI>Harlay,</HI> the fir&s;t of the <HI>French</HI> Plenipotentiaries, came to the <HI>Hague,</HI> who, as was believed, had the &s;ecret. He &s;hewed a fairer inclination, than had appeared in the others, to treat frankly and honourably; and to clear all the Difficulties, that had been &s;tarted before: But while they were negotiating, by exchanging Papers, which was a &s;low method, &s;ubject to much delay, and too many ex|ceptions and eva&s;ions; The Mar&s;hal <HI>Bouflers</HI> de&s;ired a Confe|rence with the Earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> and by the order of their Ma&s;ters, they met four times, and were long alone: That Lord told me him&s;elf, that the &s;ubject of tho&s;e Conferences, was concerning King <HI>James:</HI> The King de&s;ired to know, how the

King of <HI>France</HI> intended to di&s;po&s;e of him, and how he could own him, and yet &s;upport the other: The King of <HI>France</HI> would not renounce the protecting him, by any Article of the Treaty: But it was agreed between them, that the King of <HI>France</HI> &s;hould give him no a&s;&s;i&s;tance, nor give the King any di&s;turbance on his account: And that he &s;hould retire from the Court of <HI>France,</HI> either to <HI>Avignon</HI> or to <HI>Italy:</HI> On the other hand, his Queen &s;hould have Fifty thou&s;and pounds a Year, which was her Jointure, &s;ettled after his Death, and that it &s;hould now be paid her, he being reckoned as dead to the Nation; and in this, the King very readily acquie&s;ced: The&s;e Meetings made the Treaty go on with more di&s;patch, this ten|der point being once &s;ettled.</P>
<P>A new Difficulty aro&s;e with relation to the Empire: The <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Peace was made and the Treaty &s;ign|ed.</NOTE> <HI>French</HI> offered <HI>Brizack</HI> and <HI>Fribourg,</HI> as an equivalent for <HI>Stras|bourg;</HI> The Court of <HI>Vienna</HI> con&s;ented to this, but the Empire refu&s;ed it; The&s;e Places belonged to the Emperor's Hereditary Dominions, whereas <HI>Strasbourg</HI> was a free City, as well as a Prote&s;tant Town; So the Emperor was &s;oon brought to accept of the exchange. All other matters were concerted; <HI>Spain</HI> was now as impatient of Delays, as <HI>France: England</HI> and the <HI>States</HI> had no other concern in the Treaty, but to &s;ecure their Allies, and to &s;ettle a Barrier in the <HI>Netherlands;</HI> So in <HI>Sep|tember</HI> the Treaty was &s;igned by all, except the <HI>German</HI> Princes: But a &s;et time was prefixed for them to come into it. The Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> was comprehended within it; and the Princes of the Empire, finding they could &s;truggle no longer, did at la&s;t con&s;ent to it. A new piece of Treachery, again&s;t the Pro|te&s;tant Religion, broke out in the conclu&s;ion of all: The <HI>French</HI> declared that, that part of the Palatinate, which was &s;tipulated to be re&s;tored in the &s;tate in which it was, by virtue of that Article, was to continue in the &s;ame &s;tate, with relation to Re|ligion, in which it was at that time: By this, &s;everal Churches were to be condemned, that otherwi&s;e, according to the Laws of the Empire, and in particular of tho&s;e Dominions, were to be re&s;tored to the Prote&s;tants: The Elector <HI>Palatine</HI> accepted of the condition very willingly, being bigotted to a high de|gree: But &s;ome of the Princes, the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> in particu|lar, as Duke of <HI>Deuxponts,</HI> refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to it: But this had been &s;ecretly concerted, among the whole <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Party, who are always firm to the Intere&s;ts of their Religion, and zealous for them; Whereas, the Prote&s;tant Courts are too ready to Sacrifice the common Intere&s;t of their Religion, to their own private advantage. The King was troubled at this treacherous
<PB N="202" REF="223">
Motion, but he &s;aw no Inclination in any of the Allies to op|po&s;e it, with the zeal with which it was pre&s;&s;ed on the other hand: The Importance of the thing, Sixteen Churches being only condemned by it, as the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> told me, was not &s;uch as to de&s;erve, he &s;hould venture a rupture upon it: And it was thought, the Elector <HI>Palatine</HI> might, on other ac|counts, be &s;o obnoxious to the Prote&s;tants, and might need their A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Protection &s;o much, that he would be obliged afterwards to re&s;tore the&s;e Churches, thus wre&s;ted from them: So the King contented him&s;elf, with ordering his Plenipotentiaries to prote&s;t again&s;t this, which they did in a formal Act, that they pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The King by this Peace concluded the great De&s;ign, of put|ting a &s;top to the progre&s;s of the <HI>French</HI> Arms, which he had <NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections on the Peace.</NOTE> con&s;tantly pur&s;ued from his fir&s;t appearance on the Stage, in the Year 1672. There was not one of the Allies who. complain|ed, that he had been forgot by him, or wronged in the Trea|ty: Nor had the de&s;ire, of having his Title univer&s;ally acknow|ledged, rai&s;ed any impatience in him, or made him run into this Peace with any indecent ha&s;te. The terms of it were &s;till too much to the advantage of <HI>France;</HI> But the length and charge of the War had &s;o exhau&s;ted the Allies, that the King &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of accepting the be&s;t Conditions that could be got: It is true, <HI>France</HI> was more hara&s;&s;ed by the War, yet the arbitrary frame of that Government made their King, the Ma&s;ter of the whole Wealth of his people; And the War was managed on both &s;ides, between them and us, with this vi&s;ible difference, that every Man who dealt with the <HI>French</HI> King was ruined by it; whereas, among us, every Man grew rich by his dealings with the King: And it was not ea&s;y to &s;ee, how this could be either prevented or puni&s;hed. The regard that is &s;hewn to the Members of Parliament among us, makes that few abu&s;es can be enquired into or di&s;covered; And the King found his Reign grow &s;o unacceptable to his people, by the conti|nuance of the War, that he &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of coming to a Peace. The <HI>States</HI> were under the &s;ame pre&s;&s;ure; they were heavier charged, and &s;uffered more by the War than the <HI>Eng|li&s;h:</HI> The <HI>French</HI> got indeed nothing by a War which they had mo&s;t perfidiou&s;ly begun; They were forced to return to the Peace of <HI>Nimeguen; Pignerol</HI> and <HI>Brizack,</HI> which Cardi|nal <HI>Richlieu</HI> had con&s;idered as the Keys of <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> were now parted with; And all that ba&s;e practice, of claiming &s;o much, under the head of Re-unions and Dependencies, was abandoned: The Dutchy of <HI>Lorrain</HI> was al&s;o entirely re&s;tored;
<PB N="203" REF="224">
It was generally thought, that the King of <HI>France</HI> intended, to live out the re&s;t of his days in quiet; For his parting with <HI>Barcelona,</HI> made all people conclude, that he did not intend to pro&s;ecute the <HI>Dauphin</HI>'s Preten&s;ions upon the Crown of <HI>Spain,</HI> after that King's Death, by a new War; and that he would only try how to manage it by Negotiation.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t melancholy part of this Treaty was, that no ad|vantages were got by it, in favour of the Prote&s;tants in <HI>France;</HI> The <HI>French</HI> Refugees made all po&s;&s;ible Applications to the King, and to the other Prote&s;tant Allies; But as they were no part of the Cau&s;e of the War, &s;o it did not appear that the Allies could do more for them, than to recommend them, in the warme&s;t manner, to the King of <HI>France;</HI> But he was &s;o far engaged in a cour&s;e of Super&s;tition and Cruelty, that their condition be|came wor&s;e by the Peace; The Court was more at lei&s;ure to look after them, and to per&s;ecute them, than they thought fit to do, during the War. The Military Men in <HI>France</HI> did ge|nerally complain of the Peace, as di&s;honourable and ba&s;e; The Jacobites among us, were the more confounded at the News of it, becau&s;e the Court of <HI>France</HI> did, to the la&s;t minute, a&s;|&s;ure King <HI>James,</HI> that they would never abandon his Intere&s;ts: And his Queen &s;ent over a&s;&s;urances, to their Party here, that <HI>England</HI> would be left out of the Treaty, and put to maintain the War alone: Of which they were &s;o confident, that they entred into deep Wagers upon it; a practice little known among us before the War, but it was carried on, in the progre&s;s of it, to a very extravagant degree; So that they were ruined in their Fortunes, as well as &s;unk in their Expectations, by the Peace; Upon which, it was &s;aid, King <HI>James</HI>'s Queen made a bold Repartee to the <HI>French</HI> King, when he told her the Peace was &s;igned: She &s;aid, &s;he wi&s;hed it might be &s;uch, as &s;hould rai&s;e his Glory, as much as it might &s;ettle his Repo&s;e.</P>
<P>But while the Peace was concluded in the&s;e parts, the War between the Emperor and the <HI>Turk,</HI> went on in <HI>Hungary:</HI> The Imperial Army was commanded by Prince <HI>Eugene,</HI> a Bro|ther of the Count of <HI>Soi&s;&s;ons,</HI> who apprehending, that he was not like to be &s;o much con&s;idered, as he thought he might de&s;erve in <HI>France,</HI> went and &s;erved the Emperor, and grew up, in a few years, to be one of the greate&s;t Generals of the Age.</P>
<P>The <HI>Grand Signior</HI> came to command his Armies in per&s;on, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> Army in <HI>Hungary</HI> routed.</NOTE> and lay encamped on both &s;ides of the <HI>Thei&s;&s;e,</HI> having laid a Bridge over the River; Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> marched up to him, and attackt his Camp, on the We&s;t &s;ide of the River, and after a

&s;hort di&s;pute, he broke in and was Ma&s;ter of the Camp, and forces all, who lay on that &s;ide, over the River; In this ac|tion many were killed and drowned; he followed them cro&s;s the <HI>Thei&s;&s;e</HI> and gave them a total de&s;eat: Mo&s;t of their Jani|zaries were cut off, and the Prince became Ma&s;ter of all their Ar|tillery and Magazines: The <HI>Grand Signior</HI> him&s;elf narrowly e|&s;caped, with a Body of Hor&s;e, to <HI>Belgrade;</HI> This was a com|pleat Victory, and was the greate&s;t blow the <HI>Turks</HI> had received, in the whole War. At the &s;ame time, the <HI>Czar</HI> was very &s;ucce&s;ful on his &s;ide again&s;t the <HI>Tartarians.</HI> The <HI>Venetians</HI> did little on their part, and the Confu&s;ions in <HI>Poland</HI> made that Republick but a feeble Ally: So that the weight of the War lay wholly on the Emperor. But tho' he, being now delivered from the War with <HI>France,</HI> was more at lei&s;ure to pro&s;ecute this, yet his Revenue was &s;o exhau&s;ted, that he was willing to &s;uffer a Treaty to be carried on, by the Mediation of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Hol|land;</HI> And the <HI>French,</HI> being now no longer concerned to en|gage the Port to carry on the War, the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> fearing a Revolution upon his ill &s;ucce&s;s, was very glad to hearken to a Treaty, which was carried on all this Winter, and was fi|ni&s;hed the next year at <HI>Carlowitz,</HI> from which place it takes its name.</P>
<P>By it, both Parties were to keep that, of which they were <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Peace of <HI>Carlo|witz.</HI></NOTE> then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and &s;o this long War of <HI>Hungary,</HI> which had brought both &s;ides by turns very near the la&s;t extremities, was concluded by the Direction and Mediation of the King of <HI>Eng|land:</HI> Upon which I will add a curious Ob&s;ervation, that tho' it may &s;eem to be out of the Laws of Hi&s;tory, yet con&s;idering my Profe&s;&s;ion, will I hope be forgiven.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Lloyd,</HI> the pre&s;ent mo&s;t learned Bi&s;hop of <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The dura|tion of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Wars.</NOTE> who has now, for above twenty Years, been &s;tudying the <HI>Reve|lations</HI> with an amazing diligence and exactne&s;s, had long be|fore this year &s;aid, The Peace, between the <HI>Turks</HI> and the <HI>Pa|pal</HI> Chri&s;tians, was certainly to be made in the year 1698, which he made out thus: The four Angels, mentioned in the fourteenth Chapter of the <HI>Revelations,</HI> that were bound in the River <HI>Euphrates,</HI> which he expounds to be the Captains of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Forces, that till then were &s;ubject to the <HI>Sultan</HI> at <HI>Ba|bylon,</HI> were to be loo&s;ed, or freed from that Yoke, and to &s;et up for them&s;elves: And the&s;e were prepared, to &s;lay the third part of men, for an hour, a day, a month, and a year: He reck|ons the year, in St. <HI>John,</HI> is the <HI>Julian</HI> year of 365 days, that is, in the Prophetick &s;tile, each day a year; a month is 30 of the&s;e days; and a day makes one; which added to the former
<PB N="205" REF="226">
number makes 396. Now he proves from Hi&s;torians, that <HI>Ot|toman</HI> came, and began his Conque&s;ts at <HI>Prou&s;&s;e,</HI> in the year 1302, to which the former number, in which they were to &s;lay the third part of men, being added, it mu&s;t end in the year 1698: And tho' the Hi&s;torians do not mark the hour, or the twelfth part of the day or year, which is a month, that is, the beginning of the De&s;truction the <HI>Turks</HI> were to make; yet he is confident, if that is ever known, that the Prophecy will be found, even in that, to be punctually accompli&s;hed. After this, he thinks their time of hurting the <HI>Papal</HI> Chri&s;tians, is at an end; They may indeed &s;till do mi&s;chief to the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> or per&s;ecute their own Chri&s;tian Subjects, but they can do no hurt to the <HI>Papalins;</HI> and he is &s;o po&s;itive in this, that he con&s;ents that all his Scheme &s;hould be laid a&s;ide, if the <HI>Turk</HI> engages in a new War with them; and I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that their refu&s;ing now, in a cour&s;e of three years, to take any advantage from the Troubles in <HI>Hungary,</HI> to begin the War again, tho' we know they have been much &s;ollicited to it, gives for the pre&s;ent a confirmation, to this learned Prelate's Expo&s;ition of that part of the Prophecy.</P>
<P>The King came over to <HI>England,</HI> about the middle of <HI>No|vember;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King came back to <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> And was received by the City of <HI>London,</HI> in a &s;ort of Triumph, with all the Magnificence that he would admit; Some progre&s;s was made in preparing Triumphal Arches, but he put a &s;top to it; He &s;eemed, by a natural mode&s;ty, to have contracted an antipathy to all vain &s;hows; which was much increa&s;ed in him, by what he had heard of the gro&s;s exce&s;&s;es of flattery, to which the <HI>French</HI> have run, beyond the exam|ples of former Ages, in honour of their King; Who having &s;hewed too great a plea&s;ure in the&s;e, they have been &s;o far pur|&s;ued, that the wit of that Nation has been for &s;ome years chiefly imployed on the&s;e; For they &s;aw that mens fortunes were more certainly advanced, by a new and lively invention in that way, than by any &s;ervice or merit what&s;oever. This, in which that King has &s;eemed to be too much plea&s;ed, rendring him contemptible to better Judges, gave the King &s;uch an aver|&s;ion to every thing that looked that way, that he &s;carce bore even with things, that were decent and proper.</P>
<P>The King ordered many of his Troops to be disbanded &s;oon <NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;ulta|tions about a &s;tanding Army.</NOTE> after the Peace; But a &s;top was put to that, becau&s;e the <HI>French</HI> were very &s;low in evacuating the Places, that were to be re&s;tor|ed by the Treaty, and were not beginning to reduce their Troops: So, tho' the King declared what he intended to do, yet he made no ha&s;te to execute it, till it &s;hould appear how
<PB N="206" REF="227">
the <HI>French</HI> intended to govern them&s;elves. The King thought it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, to keep up a con&s;iderable Land Force; he knew the <HI>French</HI> would &s;till maintain great Ar|mies, and that the pretended Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> would certainly be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by them, if <HI>England</HI> &s;hould fall into a feeble and defencele&s;s Condition; The King of <HI>Spain</HI> was al&s;o, in &s;uch an uncertain &s;tate of health, &s;o weak and &s;o exhau&s;ted, that it &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary, that <HI>England</HI> &s;hould be in a condition to bar <HI>France</HI>'s invading that Empire, and to maintain the Rights of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria.</HI> But tho' he explained him&s;elf thus in general to his Mini&s;ters, yet he would not de&s;cend to particu|lars, to tell how many he thought nece&s;&s;ary, &s;o that they had not authority to declare, what was the lowe&s;t number the King in&s;i&s;ted on.</P>
<P>Papers were writ on both &s;ides, for and again&s;t a &s;tanding <NOTE PLACE="marg">The matter argued on both &s;ides.</NOTE> Force; On the one hand, it was pretended, that a &s;tanding Army was incompatible with publick Liberty, and according to the Examples of former times, the one mu&s;t &s;wallow up the other; It was propo&s;ed, that the Militia might be better modelled and more trained, which, with a good naval Force, &s;ome thought, would be an effectual &s;ecurity again&s;t Foreign Inva&s;ions, as well as it would maintain our Laws and Liberties at home. On the other &s;ide, it was urged, that &s;ince all our Neighbours were armed, and the mo&s;t formidable of them all kept up &s;uch a mighty Force, nothing could give us a real &s;ecurity, but a good Body of regulated Troops; Nothing could be made of the Militia, chiefly of the Hor&s;e, but at a va&s;t charge; and if it was well regulated, and well commanded, it would prove a mighty Army; But this of the Militia was only talked of, to put by the other; for no project was ever propo&s;ed to render it more u&s;eful; A Force at Sea might be &s;o &s;hattered, while the Enemy kept within their Ports (as it actually happened at the Revolution) that this &s;trength might come to be u&s;ele&s;s, when we &s;hould need it mo&s;t; So that without a con&s;iderable Land Force, it &s;eemed the Nation would be too much expo&s;ed. The word, <HI>&s;tanding Army,</HI> had an odious &s;ound in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> ears; So the popularity lay on the other &s;ide; And the King's Mi|ni&s;ters &s;uffered generally in the good Characters, they had hi|therto maintained, becau&s;e they &s;tudied to &s;top the tide, that run &s;o &s;trong the other way.</P>

like the way the King took of offering them his opinion in the point: This &s;eemed a pre&s;cription to them, and might bia&s;s &s;ome, in the Coun&s;els they were to offer the King, and be a bar to the freedom of Debate; The Managers for the Court had no Or|ders to name any number; So the Hou&s;e came to a Re&s;o|lution of paying off and disbanding all the Forces, that had been rai&s;ed &s;ince the year 1680; This Vote brought the Army to be le&s;s than 8000: The Court was &s;truck with this; and <NOTE PLACE="marg">A &s;mall force kept up.</NOTE> then they tried, by an after-game, to rai&s;e the number to 15000 Hor&s;e and Foot. If this had been propo&s;ed in time, it would probably have been carried without any difficulty; but the King was &s;o long upon the re&s;erve, that now, when he thought fit to &s;peak out his mind, he found it was too late: So a Force not exceeding 10000 Hor&s;e and Foot was all that the Hou&s;e could be brought to. This gave the King the greate&s;t di&s;ta&s;te of any thing, that had befallen him in his whole Reign; He thought it would derogate much from him, and render his Alliance &s;o incon&s;iderable, that he doubted whether he could carry on the Government, after it &s;hould be reduced to &s;o weak and &s;o contemptible a &s;tate. He &s;aid, that if he could have imagined, that after all the &s;ervice he &s;hould have done the Nation, he &s;hould have met with &s;uch returns, he would never have meddled in our Affairs; and that he was weary of govern|ing a Nation, that was &s;o jealous, as to lay it&s;elf open to an Enemy, rather than tru&s;t him, who had acted &s;o faithfully dur|ing his whole Life, that he had never once deceived tho&s;e who tru&s;ted him.

<P>During the&s;e Debates, the Earl of <HI>Sunderland</HI> had argued with many upon the nece&s;&s;ity of keeping up a greater Force; <NOTE PLACE="marg">1698 The Earl of <HI>Sunderland</HI> retired from bu&s;ine&s;s.</NOTE> This was in &s;o many hands, that he was charged as the Author of the Coun&s;el, of keeping on foot a &s;tanding Army: So he was often named in the Hou&s;e of Commons, with many &s;evere reflections, for which there had been but too much occa&s;ion given, during the two former Reigns. The Tories pre&s;&s;ed hard upon him, and the Whigs were &s;o jealous of him, that he appre|hending, that while the former would attack him, the others would defend him faintly, re&s;olved to prevent a publick affront, and to retire from the Court and from Bu&s;ine&s;s; not only again&s;t the entreaties of his Friends, but even the King's earne&s;t de&s;ire that he would continue about him; Indeed, upon this occa&s;ion, his Maje&s;ty expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch a concern and value for him, that

the jealou&s;ies were encrea&s;ed, by the confidence the Court &s;aw, the King had in him. During the time of his credit, things had been carried on, with more &s;pirit and better &s;ucce&s;s than before: He had gained &s;uch an a&s;cendant over the King, that he brought him to agree to &s;ome things, that few expected he would have yielded to: He managed the publick affairs, in both Hou&s;es, with &s;o much &s;teddine&s;s and &s;o good a conduct, that he had procured to him&s;elf a greater mea&s;ure of e&s;teem, than he had in any of the former parts of his Life; And the feeblene&s;s and disjointed &s;tate we fell into, after he withdrew, contributed not a little to e&s;tabli&s;h the Cha|racter, which his admini&s;tration had gained him.</P>
<P>The Parliament went on &s;lowly in fixing the Fund for the Supplies they had voted: They &s;ettled a Revenue on the King <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Civil Li&s;t &s;ettled on the King for Life.</NOTE> for Life, for the ordinary expence of the Government, which was called the Civil Li&s;t: This they carried to Seven hundred thou&s;and pounds a year, which was much more than the for|mer Kings of <HI>England</HI> could apply to tho&s;e occa&s;ions; Six hundred thou&s;and pounds was all that was de&s;igned, but it had been promi&s;ed at the Treaty of <HI>Ry&s;wick,</HI> that King <HI>James,</HI> be|ing now as dead to <HI>England,</HI> his Queen &s;hould enjoy her Join|ture, that was Fifty thou&s;and pound a year; and it was intend|ed to &s;ettle a Court about the Duke of <HI>Gloce&s;ter,</HI> who was then nine years old; So to enable the King, to bear that expence, this large provi&s;ion was made for the Civil Li&s;t: But by &s;ome great error in the management, tho' the Court never had &s;o much, and never &s;pent &s;o little, yet payments were ill made, and by &s;ome &s;trange con&s;umption, all was wa&s;ted.</P>
<P>While the Hou&s;e of Commons was &s;eeking a Fund, for paying the Arrears of the Army, and for the Expence at Sea <NOTE PLACE="marg">A new <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Com|pany.</NOTE> and Land for the next year; A Propo&s;ition was made, for con&s;tituting a new <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company, who &s;hould trade with a joint Stock, others being admitted in a determinate Propor|tion to a &s;eparate Trade: The old <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company oppo&s;ed this, and offered to advance a Sum (but far &s;hort of what the publick Occa&s;ions required) for an Act of Parliament, that &s;hould confirm their Charters. The Projectors of the new Company offered two Millions, upon the &s;ecurity of a good Fund, to pay the Intere&s;t of their Money at eight <HI>per Cent;</HI> Great oppo&s;ition was made to this: For the King, upon an Ad|dre&s;s that was made to him by the Hou&s;e of Commons, had granted the old Company a new Charter, they being obliged to take in a new Sub&s;cription of Seven hundred thou&s;and pounds, to encrea&s;e their Stock and Trade. Tho&s;e empowered

by this new Charter, were not charged with any Malever&s;ation; They had been trading under great di&s;advantages, and with great lo&s;&s;es, by rea&s;on of the War: It is true, the King had re&s;erved a power to him&s;elf, by a clau&s;e in the Charter, to di&s;&s;olve them upon warning given, three years before &s;uch di&s;&s;olution: So it was &s;aid, that no inju&s;tice was done them, if publick notice &s;hould be given of &s;uch an intended di&s;&s;olution. To this it was an&s;wered, that the Clau&s;e, re&s;erving that power, was put in many Charters, but that it was con&s;idered only as a threat|ning, obliging them to a good conduct; But that it was not ordinary to di&s;&s;olve a Company, by virtue of &s;uch a Clau&s;e, when no Error or Malever&s;ation was objected: The old Company came at la&s;t to offer the whole Sum that was wanted; But the Party was now formed, &s;o they came too late, and this had no other effect, but to rai&s;e a clamour again&s;t this proceeding, as extremely rigorous, if not unju&s;t. This threw the old Com|pany, and all concerned in it, into the hands of the Tories, and made a great breach and disjointing in the City of <HI>Lon|don:</HI> And it is certain, that this Act, together with the Incli|nations which tho&s;e of the Whigs, who were in good Po&s;ts, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Whigs lo&s;e their credit in the Nation.</NOTE> had expre&s;&s;ed for keeping up a greater Land Force, did con|tribute to the bla&s;ting the reputation, they had hitherto main|tained, of being good Patriots, and was made u&s;e of over <HI>England</HI> by the Tories, to di&s;grace both the King and them. To this, another charge of a high nature was added, that they robbed the Publick, and applied much of the Money, that was given for the &s;ervice of the Nation, both to the &s;upporting a va&s;t Expence, and to the rai&s;ing great E&s;tates to them&s;elves. This was &s;en&s;ible to the people, who were unea&s;y under heavy Taxes, and were too ready to believe, that, according to the practice in King <HI>Charles</HI>'s time, a great deal of the Money that was given in Parliament&punc; was divided among tho&s;e who gave it. The&s;e clamours were rai&s;ed and managed with great dexterity, by tho&s;e, who intended to render the King, and all who were be&s;t affected to him, &s;o odious to the Nation, that by this means they might carry &s;uch an Election, of a new Hou&s;e of Com|mons, as that by it all might be overturned. It was &s;aid, that the Bank of <HI>England</HI> and the new <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company, being in the hands of Whigs, they would have the command of all the Money, and by con&s;equence, of all the Trade of <HI>England;</HI> So a great Party was rai&s;ed again&s;t the new Company, in both Hou&s;es: But the Act for it was carried: The King was very indifferent in the matter at fir&s;t, but the greatne&s;s of the Sum that was wanted, which could not probably be rai&s;ed by any

<P>Before the King went into <HI>Holland,</HI> which was in <HI>July,</HI> News came from <HI>Spain,</HI> that their King was dying; This <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s ill &s;tate of health.</NOTE> Alarm was often given before, but it came much quicker now; The <HI>French</HI> upon this, &s;ent a Fleet to lie before <HI>Cadiz,</HI> which came thither, at the time that the Galleons were expected home from the <HI>We&s;t-Indies;</HI> And it was apprehended, that, if the King had died, they would have &s;eized on all that Trea|&s;ure. We &s;ent a Fleet thither to &s;ecure them, but it came too late, to have done any &s;ervice, if it had been needed; This was much cen&s;ured, but the Admiralty excu&s;ed them&s;elves, by &s;aying, that the Parliament was &s;o late in fixing the Funds for the Fleet, that it was not po&s;&s;ible to be ready &s;ooner than they were: The King of <HI>Spain</HI> recovered for that time, but it was &s;o far from any entire recovery, that a Relap&s;e was &s;till apprehended. When the King went to <HI>Holland,</HI> he left &s;ome &s;ealed Orders behind him, of which &s;ome of his Mini&s;ters told me, they knew not the contents till they were opened: By the&s;e, the King ordered 16000 Men to be kept up; For excu&s;ing this, it was &s;aid, that tho' the Parliament had, in their Votes, mentioned only 10000 Land men, to whom they had afterwards added 3000 Marines, and had rai&s;ed only the Money nece&s;&s;ary for that number, yet no de|termined number was mentioned in the Act it&s;elf; So, &s;ince the apprehen&s;ion of the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Death made it advi&s;a|ble, to have a greater force ready for &s;uch an Accident, the King re&s;olved to keep up a Force, &s;omewhat beyond that, which the Hou&s;e of Commons had con&s;ented to; The leaving the&s;e Orders &s;ealed, made the whole blame to be ca&s;t &s;ingly on the King, as it skreened the Mini&s;ters from a &s;hare in this Coun&s;el: And we have more than once known Mini&s;ters put the advices, that they them&s;elves gave, in &s;uch a manner on their Ma&s;ters, that in executing them, our Kings have taken more care to &s;helter their Mini&s;ters, than to pre&s;erve them&s;elves.</P>

on publick as well as on private accounts, never to engage in any oppo&s;ition to him, and yet I could not help thinking he might have carried matters further than he did; And that he was giving his Enemies handles, to weaken his Government. I had tried, but with little &s;ucce&s;s, to u&s;e all due freedom with him; He did not love to be found fault with; and tho' he bore every thing that I &s;aid very gently, yet he either di&s;couraged me with &s;ilence, or an&s;wered in &s;uch general expre&s;&s;ions, that they &s;ignified little or nothing. The&s;e con&s;iderations di&s;po&s;ed me, rather to retire from the Court and Town, than to engage deeper in &s;uch a con&s;tant attendance, for &s;o many years, as this Imployment might run out to; The King made it indeed ea&s;y, in one re&s;pect; for as the young Prince was to be all the Summer at <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> which was in my Dioce&s;e; So he allowed me ten weeks in the year, for the other parts of my Dioce&s;e. All my endeavours to decline this were without effect; the King would tru&s;t that care only to me, and the Prince&s;s gave me &s;uch encouragement, that I re&s;olved not only to &s;ubmit to this, which &s;eemed to come from a direction of Providence, but to give my &s;elf wholly up to it. I took, to my own Province, the reading and explaining the Scriptures to him, the in&s;tructing him in the Principles of Religion, and the Rules of Virtue, and the giving him a view of Hi&s;tory, Geography, Politicks and Go|vernment. I re&s;olved al&s;o to look very exactly to all the Ma&s;|ters, that were appointed to teach him other things; But now I turn, to give an account of &s;ome things, that more immedi|ately belong to my own Profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>This year, <HI>Thomas Firmin,</HI> a famous Citizen of <HI>London,</HI> di|ed; <NOTE PLACE="marg">The pro|gre&s;s of So|ciniani&s;m.</NOTE> He was in great e&s;teem, for promoting many charitable De|&s;igns, for looking after the Poor of the City, and &s;etting them to work; for rai&s;ing great Sums for Schools and Ho&s;pitals, and indeed, for Charities of all &s;orts, private and publick; He had &s;uch credit with the riche&s;t Citizens, that he had the command of great Wealth, as oft as there was occa&s;ion for it; And he laid out his own time chiefly, in advancing all &s;uch de&s;igns: The&s;e things gained him a great reputation; He was called a <HI>Socinian,</HI> but was really an <HI>Arian,</HI> which he very freely own|ed, before the Revolution; But he gave no publick vent to it, as he did afterwards. He &s;tudied to promote his Opinions, af|ter the Revolution, with much heat; Many Books were print|ed again&s;t the Trinity, which he di&s;per&s;ed over the Nation, di&s;|tributing them freely to all who would accept of them; Pro|fane Wits were much delighted with this; It became a com|mon Topick of Di&s;cour&s;e, to treat all My&s;teries in Religion, as

the contrivances of Prie&s;ts, to bring the World into a blind &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to them; Prie&s;tcraft grew to be another word in fa&s;hion, and the Enemies of Religion vented all their Impieties, under the cover of the&s;e words; But while the&s;e pretended much zeal for the Government, tho&s;e who were at work to under|mine it, made great u&s;e of all this; They rai&s;ed a great outcry again&s;t Socinani&s;m, and gave it out, that it was like to over-run all; For Archbi&s;hop <HI>Tillot&s;on,</HI> and &s;ome of the Bi&s;hops, had lived in great friend&s;hip with Mr. <HI>Firmin,</HI> who&s;e charitable tem|per they thought it became them to encourage; Many under|took to write in this Controver&s;y; Some of the&s;e were not fit|ted for handling &s;uch a nice Subject; A learned Dei&s;t made a &s;evere remark on the progre&s;s of this Di&s;pute; He &s;aid, he was &s;ure the Divines would be too hard for the <HI>Socinians,</HI> in proving their Doctrines out of Scripture; But if the Doctrine could be once laughed at and rejected as ab&s;urd, then its being proved, how well &s;oever, out of Scripture, would turn to be an Argument again&s;t the Scriptures them&s;elves, as containing &s;uch incredible Doctrines.</P>
<P>The Divines did not go all in the &s;ame method, nor upon the &s;ame Principles; Dr. <HI>Sherlock</HI> engaged in the Controver&s;y; <NOTE PLACE="marg">$span$ferent $span$lana|$span$s of the $span$y</NOTE> He was a clear, a polite and a &s;trong Writer, and had got great credit in the former Reign, by his Writings again&s;t tho&s;e of the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> But he was apt to a&s;&s;ume too much to him&s;elf, and to treat his Adver&s;aries with contempt; This creat|ed him many Enemies, and made him pa&s;s for an in&s;olent haugh|ty Man; He was at fir&s;t a Jacobite, and while, for not taking the Oaths, he was under &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, he wrote again&s;t the <HI>So|cinians,</HI> in which he took a new method of explaining the Trinity; He thought there were three eternal Minds; two of the&s;e i&s;&s;uing from the Father, but that the&s;e were one, by rea|&s;on of a mutual con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s in the three, to every of their thoughts: This was looked on as plain Trithei&s;m; But all the Party applauded him and his Book; Soon after that, an accident of an odd nature happened.</P>
<P>There was a Book drawn up by Bi&s;hop <HI>Overall,</HI> four&s;core <NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ $span$erl$ck $word$ J$|$span$.</NOTE> years ago, concerning Government; in which, its being of a Divine In&s;titution was very po&s;itively a&s;&s;erted; It was read in Convocation, and pa&s;&s;ed by that Body, in order to the pub|li&s;hing it, in oppo&s;ition to the Principles laid down, in that fa|mous book of <HI>Par&s;on's</HI> the Je&s;uit, publi&s;hed under the name of <HI>Dollman;</HI> King <HI>James</HI> the Fir&s;t, did not like a Convoca|tion entring into &s;uch a Theory of Politicks; So he wrote a long Letter to <HI>Abbot,</HI> who was afterwards Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Can|terbury,</HI>

but was then in the Lower Hou&s;e; I had the Original, writ all in his own hand, in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; By it he de&s;ired, that no further progre&s;s &s;hould be made in that matter, and that this Book might not be offered to him for his a&s;&s;ent: Thus that matter &s;lept, but <HI>Sancroft</HI> had got <HI>Overal</HI>'s own Book into his hands; So, in the beginning of this Reign, he re&s;olved to publi&s;h it, as an authentick Declaration, that the Church of <HI>England</HI> had made in this matter; And it was publi&s;hed, as well as licen&s;ed by him, a very few days before he came under &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, for not taking the Oaths: But there was a Para|graph or two in it, that they had not con&s;idered, which was plainly calculated, to ju&s;tify the owning the United Provinces to be a lawful Government: For it was there laid down, that when a change of Government was brought to a thorough &s;et|tlement, it was then to be owned and &s;ubmitted to, as a work of the Providence of God; and a part of King <HI>James</HI>'s Letter to <HI>Abbot</HI> related to this. When <HI>Sherlock</HI> ob&s;erved this, he had &s;ome Conferences with the Party, in order to convince them by that, which he &s;aid had convinced him&s;elf; Soon after that he took the Oaths, and was made Dean of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s; He publi&s;hed an account of the grounds he went on, which drew out many virulent Books again&s;t him; After that they pur&s;ued him with the clamour of Trithei&s;m, which was done with much malice, by the very &s;ame per&s;ons, who had highly magnified the performance, while he was of their Party: So powerful is the bia&s;s of intere&s;t and pa&s;&s;ion, in the mo&s;t &s;peculative and the mo&s;t important Doctrines.</P>

He explained the Trinity in the common method, that the Deity was one E&s;&s;ence in three Sub&s;i&s;tencies; <HI>Sherlock</HI> replied, and charged this as Sabelliani&s;m; and &s;ome others went into the Di&s;pute, with &s;ome Learning, but with more heat: One preached <HI>Sherlock</HI>'s Notion, before the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Oxford,</HI> for which he was cen&s;ured; but <HI>Sherlock</HI> wrote again&s;t that Cen&s;ure, with the highe&s;t &s;trains of contempt: The <HI>Socinians</HI> triumphed, not a little upon all this: and, in &s;erveral of their Books, they divi|ded their Adver&s;aries into real and nominal Trinitarians; <HI>Sher|lock</HI> was put in the fir&s;t Cla&s;s; As for the &s;econd Cla&s;s, they pretended it had been the Doctrine of the We&s;tern Church,

<P>The ill effects that were like to follow, on tho&s;e different <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Injunctions &s;ilence tho&s;e Di&s;putes.</NOTE> Explanations, made the Bi&s;hops move the King to &s;et out In|junctions, requiring them to &s;ee to the repre&s;&s;ing of Error and Here&s;y, with all po&s;&s;ible zeal, more particularly in the funda|mental Articles of the Chri&s;tian Faith: And to watch again&s;t and hinder the u&s;e of new Terms or new Explanations in tho&s;e mat|ters: This put a &s;top to tho&s;e Debates, as Mr. <HI>Firmin</HI>'s Death put a &s;top to the printing and &s;preading of <HI>Socinian</HI> Books. Upon all this, &s;ome angry Clergymen, who had not that &s;hare of Preferment, that they thought they de&s;erved, begun to com|plain, that no Convocation was &s;uffered to &s;it, to whom the judging in &s;uch points, &s;eemed mo&s;t properly to belong: Books were writ on this head; It was &s;aid, that the Law made in King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth's time, that limited the Power of that body, &s;o that no new Canons could be attempted or put in u&s;e, without the King's Licen&s;e and Con&s;ent, did not di&s;able them from &s;itting: On the contrary, a Convocation was held to be a part of the Parliament, &s;o that it ought always to at|tend upon it, and to be ready, when advi&s;ed with, to give their Opinions chiefly in matters of Religion. They had al&s;o, as the&s;e men pretended, a right to prepare Articles and Canons, and to lay them before the King, who might indeed deny his a&s;&s;ent to them, as he did to Bills, that were offered him by both Hou&s;es of Parliament. This led them to &s;trike at the King's Supremacy, and to a&s;&s;ert the intrin&s;ick Power of the Church which had been di&s;owned by this Church, ever &s;ince the time of the Reformation: And indeed, the King's Supremacy was thought to be carried formerly too high, and that, by the &s;ame &s;ort of men, who were now &s;tudying to lay it as low. It &s;eemed, that &s;ome men were for maintaining it, as long as it was in their management, and that it made for them: but re&s;olved to weaken it, all they could, as &s;oon as it went out of their hands, and was no more at their di&s;cretion: Such a turn do mens intere&s;ts and partialites give to their Opi|nions.</P>

All this while it was manife&s;t, that there were two different Parties among the Clergy; One was firm and faithful to the pre&s;ent Government, and &s;erved it with zeal; The&s;e did not <NOTE PLACE="marg">Divi&s;ions among the Clergy.</NOTE> envy the Di&s;&s;enters the ca&s;e, that the Toleration gave them; they wi&s;hed for a favourable opportunity of making &s;uch alte|rations, in &s;ome few Rites and Ceremonies, as might bring into the Church tho&s;e, who were not at too great a di&s;tance from it; And I do freely own that I was of this number. Others took the Oaths indeed, and concurred in every act of compliance with the Government, but they were not only cold in &s;erving it, but were always blaming the Admini&s;tration, and aggravat|ing misfortunes; They expre&s;&s;ed a great e&s;teem for Jacobites, and in all Elections, gave their Votes to tho&s;e, who leaned that way: At the &s;ame time, they &s;hewed great re&s;entments again&s;t the Di&s;&s;enters, and were enemies to the Toleration, and &s;eemed re&s;olved never to con&s;ent to any alteration in their favour. The bulk of the Clergy ran this way, &s;o that the moderate Party was far out numbered.

There is a breach running thro' the <HI>Lutheran</HI> Churches; It appeared at fir&s;t openly at <HI>Hamborough,</HI> where many were going into &s;tricter methods of Piety, who from thence were called Pieti&s;ts; there is no difference of Opi|nion between them and the re&s;t, who are mo&s;t rigid to old forms, and are jealous of all new things, e&s;pecially of a &s;tricter cour&s;e of Devotion, beyond what they them&s;elves are inclined to practi&s;e: There is likewi&s;e a Spirit of Zeal and Devotion, and of publick Charities, &s;prung at home, beyond what was known among us in former times; of which I may have a good occa&s;ion to make mention hereafter.</P>
<P>But to return from this digre&s;&s;ion: The Company in <HI>Scot|land,</HI> this year, &s;et out a Fleet, with a Colony, on de&s;ign to <NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Scotch</HI> &s;ettle at <HI>Da|rien.</HI></NOTE> &s;ettle in <HI>America;</HI> The &s;ecret was better kept, than could have been well expected, con&s;idering the many hands in which it was lodged; It appeared at la&s;t, that the true de&s;ign had been gue&s;&s;ed, from the fir&s;t motion of it; They landed at <HI>Darien,</HI> which, by the report that they &s;ent over, was capable of being made a &s;trong place, with a good Port. It was no wonder, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> complained loudly of this; It lay &s;o near <HI>Porto Belo</HI> and <HI>Panama</HI> on the one &s;ide, and <HI>Carthagena</HI> on the other, that they could not think they were &s;afe, when &s;uch a Neighbour came &s;o near the Center of their Empire in <HI>A|merica;</HI> The King of <HI>France</HI> complained al&s;o of this, as an In|va&s;ion of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Dominion, and offered the Court of <HI>Ma|drid</HI> a Fleet to di&s;lodge them. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> pre&s;&s;ed the King hard upon this; They &s;aid, they were once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that place; and tho' they found it too unhealthy to &s;ettle there, yet the right to it belonged &s;till to them: So this was a breach of Treaties, and a violent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their Country; In an&s;wer to this, the <HI>Scotch</HI> pretended, that the Natives of <HI>Darien</HI> were never conquered by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and were by con&s;equence
<PB N="217" REF="238">
a free People; they &s;aid, they had purcha&s;ed of them leave to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of that place, and that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> aban|doned the Country, becau&s;e they could not reduce the Natives: So the preten&s;ion of the fir&s;t di&s;covery was made void, when they went off from it, not being able to hold it; and then the Natives being left to them&s;elves, it was lawful for the <HI>Scots</HI> to treat with them: It was given out, that there was much Gold in the Countrey. Certainly, the Nation was &s;o full of hopes from this Project, that they rai&s;ed a Fund for carrying it on, greater than, as was thought, that Kingdom could &s;tretch to; Four hundred thou&s;and pounds Sterling was &s;ub&s;cribed, and a fourth part was paid down, and afterwards, Seventy thou&s;and pounds more was brought in, and a National fury &s;eemed to have tran&s;ported the whole Kingdom, upon this Project.</P>
<P>The Jacobites went into the management, with a particular <NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Di&s;|putes about it.</NOTE> heat; They &s;aw the King would be much pre&s;&s;ed from <HI>Spain;</HI> The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation apprehending, that this would be &s;et up as a breach of Treaties, and that upon a Rupture, their Effects in <HI>Spain</HI> might be &s;eized, grew al&s;o very unea&s;y at it; upon which it was thought, that the King would in time be forced to di&s;own this Inva&s;ion, and to declare again&s;t it, and in that ca&s;e, they hoped to have inflamed the Kingdom with this, that the King denied them his Protection, while they were only acting according to Law; and this, they would have &s;aid, was contrary to the Coro|nation Oath, and &s;o they would have thought they were freed from their Allegiance to him. The Jacobites, having this pro&s;pect, did all that was po&s;&s;ible to rai&s;e the hopes of the Nation to the highe&s;t degree; Our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plantations grew al&s;o very jealous of this new Colony; They feared, that the double pro&s;pect, of finding Gold, and of robbing the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> would draw many Planters from them, into this new Settlement; and that the <HI>Buccaneers</HI> might run into them: For by the <HI>Scotch</HI> Act, this place was to be made a free Port; and if it was not ruined, before it was well formed, they reckoned it would become a &s;eat of Piracy and another <HI>Algiers</HI> in tho&s;e parts. Upon the&s;e grounds, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation inclined to declare again&s;t this, and the King &s;eemed convinced, that it was an infraction of his Treaties with <HI>Spain:</HI> So Orders were &s;ent, but very &s;ecret|ly, to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plantations, particularly to <HI>Jamaica</HI> and the <HI>Leeward</HI> I&s;lands, to forbid all Commerce with the <HI>Scots</HI> at <HI>Darien.</HI> The <HI>Spaniards</HI> made &s;ome faint attempts on them, but without &s;ucce&s;s; This was a very great difficulty on the King; He &s;aw how much he was like to be pre&s;&s;ed on both hands, and he apprehended what ill con&s;equences were like to follow, on his declaring him&s;elf either way.</P>

The Parliament of <HI>England</HI> had now &s;ate its period of three years, in which great things had been done; The whole Money of <HI>England</HI> was recoined, the King was &s;ecured in his Govern|ment, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The pre&s;ent Mini&s;try's good con|duct.</NOTE> an honourable Peace was made, Publick Credit was re|&s;tored, and the payment of Publick Debts was put on &s;ure and good Funds. The chief conduct lay now in a few hands; The Lord <HI>Somers</HI> was made a Baron of <HI>England;</HI> and as he was one of the able&s;t and the mo&s;t incorrupt Judges, that ever &s;ate in Chancery; &s;o his great Capacity for all Affairs made the King con&s;ider him beyond all his Mini&s;ters, and he well de&s;erved the confidence that the King expre&s;&s;ed for him on all occa&s;ions. In the Hou&s;e of Commons, Mr. <HI>Mountague</HI> had gained &s;uch a vi&s;ible a&s;cendant over all, that were zealous for the King's Ser|vice, that he gave the Law to the re&s;t, which he did always with great &s;pirit, but &s;ometimes with too a&s;&s;uming an air: The Fleet was in the Earl of <HI>Orford</HI>'s management, who was both Trea&s;urer of the Navy, and was at the head of the Admiralty; he had brought in many into the Service, who were very zea|lous for the Government, but a &s;pirit of Impiety and Di&s;&s;olu|tion ran thro' too many of them, &s;o that tho&s;e, who intended to ca&s;t a load upon the Government, had too great advantages given by &s;ome of the&s;e. The Admini&s;tration at home was otherwi&s;e without exception, and no grievances were complain|ed of.</P>
<P>There was a new Parliament called, and the Elections fell <NOTE PLACE="marg">A new Par|liament.</NOTE> generally on men, who were in the Intere&s;ts of the Govern|ment: Many of them had indeed &s;ome popular Notions, which they had drank in under a bad Government, and thought they ought to keep them under a good one; So that tho&s;e, who wi&s;hed well to the publick, did apprehend great difficulties in managing them. The King him&s;elf did not &s;eem to lay this to heart, &s;o much as was fitting; He &s;tayed long beyond Sea; He had made a vi&s;it to the Duke of <HI>Zell,</HI> where he was treated in a mo&s;t magnificent manner. Cro&s;s Winds hinder'd his coming to <HI>England,</HI> &s;o &s;oon as he had intended; upon which, the Par|liament was prorogued for &s;ome weeks, after the Members were come up; even this &s;oured their &s;pirits, and had too great a &s;hare in the ill humour, that appeared among them.</P>
<P>The King's keeping up an Army beyond the Votes of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Forces much dimi|ni&s;hed.</NOTE> former Parliament, was much re&s;ented, nor was the occa&s;ion for doing it enough con&s;idered; All this was increa&s;ed by his own management after he came over. The Mini&s;ters repre|&s;ented to him, that they could carry the keeping up a Land Force of ten or twelve thou&s;and, but that they could not carry
<PB N="219" REF="240">
it further; He &s;aid, &s;o &s;mall a number was as good as none at all, therefore he would not authorize them to propo&s;e it; On the other hand, they thought they &s;hould lo&s;e their Credit with their be&s;t friends, if they ventured to &s;peak of a greater number. So, when the Hou&s;e of Commons took up the De|bate, the Mini&s;try were &s;ilent and propo&s;ed no number; upon which tho&s;e, who were in the contrary intere&s;t, named Seven thou&s;and Men, and to this they added, that they &s;hould be all the King's natural born Subjects: Both the parts of this Vote gave the King great unea&s;ine&s;s; He &s;eemed not only to lay it much to heart, but to &s;ink under it; He tried all that was po&s;&s;ible to &s;truggle again&s;t it, when it was too late; it not be|ing &s;o ea&s;y to recover things in an after-game, as it was to have prevented this mi&s;under&s;tanding, that was like to ari&s;e between him and his Parliament. It was &s;urmized, that he was re&s;olved not to pa&s;s the Bill, but that he would abandon the Government, rather than hold it, with a Force that was too &s;mall to pre&s;erve and protect it; yet this was con&s;idered only as a threatning, &s;o that little regard was had to it: The Act pa&s;&s;ed with &s;ome oppo&s;ition in the Hou&s;e of Commons; a feeble attempt was made in the Hou&s;e of Lords again&s;t it, but it was rather a re|proach, than a &s;ervice to the Government, it being faintly made and ill &s;upported. The Royal A&s;&s;ent was given, and when it was hoped, that the pa&s;&s;ing the Act had &s;oftned peoples minds, a new attempt was made for keeping the <HI>Dutch</HI> Guards in <HI>England,</HI> but that was rejected, tho' the King &s;ent a Me&s;&s;age de&s;iring it.</P>
<P>In the carrying the&s;e points, many hard things were &s;aid <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Party oppo&s;ed the King with great bitter|ne&s;s.</NOTE> again&s;t the Court, and again&s;t the King him&s;elf; It was &s;ug|ge&s;ted, that he loved not the Nation; that he was on the re|&s;erve with all <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> and &s;hewed no confidence in them; But that as &s;oon as the Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament was over, he went immediately to <HI>Holland;</HI> And they &s;aid, this was not to look after the affairs of the <HI>States,</HI> which had been more excu|&s;able; but that he went thither to enjoy a lazy privacy at <HI>Loo;</HI> where, with a few Favourites, he hunted and pa&s;&s;ed away the Summer, in a way that did not rai&s;e his Character much. It is certain, the u&s;age he had met with of late, put his Spirits too much on the fret; and he neither took care to di&s;gui&s;e that, nor to overcome the ill humour, which the manner of his deportment, rather than any ju&s;t occa&s;ion given by him, had rai&s;ed in many again&s;t him. Some, in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, began to carry things much further, and to &s;ay, that they were not bound to maintain the Votes, and to keep up the
<PB N="220" REF="241">
Credit of the former Parliament; And they tried to &s;hake the Act, made in favour of the new <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company: This was &s;o contrary to the fundamental Maxims of our Con&s;titu|tion, that it gave cau&s;e of Jealou&s;y, &s;ince this could be intend|ed for nothing, but to ruine the Government: Money rai&s;ed by Parliament, upon Bargains and Conditions that were per|formed, by tho&s;e who advanced it, gave them &s;uch a purcha&s;e of tho&s;e Acts, and this was &s;o &s;acred, that to overturn it mu&s;t de&s;troy all Credit for the future, and no Government could be maintained that did not pre&s;erve this religiou&s;ly.</P>
<P>Among other Complaints, one made again&s;t the Court was, that the King had given Grants of the confi&s;cated E&s;tates in <NOTE PLACE="marg">1699 A Debate concerning Grants of <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> E&s;|tates.</NOTE> <HI>Ireland;</HI> It was told before, that a Bill being &s;ent up by the Commons, attainting the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> that had been in Arms, and ap|plying their E&s;tates to the paying the Publick Debts, leaving on|ly a Power to the King, to di&s;po&s;e of the third part of them, was like to lie long before the Lords; Many Petitions being of|fered again&s;t it; Upon which the King, to bring the Se&s;&s;ion to a &s;peedy conclu&s;ion, had promi&s;ed, that this matter &s;hould be kept entire, till their next meeting: But the next Se&s;&s;ion going over, without any proceeding in it, the King granted away all tho&s;e Confi&s;cations: It being an undoubted Branch of the Royal Prerogative, that all Confi&s;cations accrued to the Crown, and might be granted away at the plea&s;ure of the King: It was pretended, that tho&s;e E&s;tates came to a Million and a half in value. Great Objections were made to the merits of &s;ome, who had the large&s;t &s;hare in tho&s;e Grants; Attempts had been made, in the Parliament of <HI>Ireland,</HI> to obtain a confirmation of them, but that which <HI>Ginkle,</HI> who was created Earl of <HI>Athlone,</HI> had, was only confirmed; Now it was become a popular &s;ubject of Declamation, to arraign both the Grants, and tho&s;e who had them: Motions had been often made, for a general Re&s;umption of all the Grants, made in this Reign; But in an&s;wer to this, it was &s;aid, that &s;ince no &s;uch motion was made, for a Re|&s;umption of the Grants made in King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second's Reign, notwith&s;tanding the extravagant profu&s;ion of them, and the ill grounds, upon which they were made, it &s;hewed both a di&s;re&s;pect and a black ingratitude, if, while no other Grants were re&s;umed, this King only &s;hould be called in que&s;tion. The Court Party &s;aid often, let the Retro&s;pect go back to the year 1660, and they would con&s;ent to it, and that which might be got by it would be worth the while. It was an&s;wered, this could not be done after &s;o long a time, that &s;o many Sales,
<PB N="221" REF="242">
Mortgages, and Settlements had been made, pur&s;uant to tho&s;e Grants; So all the&s;e attempts came to nothing. But now they fell on a more effectual method: A Commi&s;&s;ion was given, by Act of Parliament, to &s;even per&s;ons named by th&eacute; Hou&s;e of Commons, to enquire into the Value of the confi&s;cated E&s;tates in <HI>Ireland</HI> &s;o granted away, and into the Con&s;iderations, upon which tho&s;e Grants were made. This pa&s;t in this Se&s;&s;ion, and in the Debates, a great alienation di&s;covered it&s;elf in many from the King and his Government, which had a very ill effect upon all affairs, both at home and abroad. When the time prefixed for the disbanding the Army came, it was reduced to Seven thou|&s;and Men: of the&s;e, Four thou&s;and were Hor&s;e and Dragoons, the Foot were Three thou&s;and; The Bodies were al&s;o reduced to &s;o &s;mall a number of Soldiers, that it was &s;aid we had now an Army of Officers: The new model was much approved of by proper judges, as the be&s;t into which &s;o &s;mall a number could have been brought. There was at the &s;ame time, a very large Provi&s;ion made for the Sea, greater than was thought nece&s;&s;ary in a time of Peace. Fifteeen thou&s;and Seamen, with a Fleet proportioned to that number, was thought a nece&s;&s;ary &s;ecurity, &s;ince we were made &s;o weak by Land.</P>

Into this, the King, the States, and the Elec|tor of <HI>Bavaria</HI> entred; The Court of <HI>Spain</HI> agreed to this; and that King, by his Will, confirmed his Father's Will, by which the Succe&s;&s;ion of the Crown was &s;ettled on the I&s;&s;ue of the &s;e|cond Daughter, and it was re&s;olved to engage all the Grandees and Cities of <HI>Spain,</HI> to maintain the Succe&s;&s;ion, according to this Settlement. The Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> complained of this, and pretended that, by a long tract of reciprocal Settlements, &s;everal mutual Entails had pa&s;&s;ed, between tho&s;e two Branches of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria;</HI> The Court of <HI>France</HI> &s;eemed al&s;o to com|plain of it, but they were &s;ecretly in it, upon engagements, that the Dominions in <HI>Italy</HI> &s;hould fall to their &s;hare; But while the&s;e engagements, in favour of the Prince Electoral,
<PB N="224" REF="245">
were rai&s;ing great apprehen&s;ions every where, that young Prince, who &s;eemed marked out for great things, and who had all the promi&s;ing beginnings, that could be expected in a Child of &s;e|ven years old, fell &s;ick, and was carried off the third or fourth day of his illne&s;s; So uncertain are all the pro&s;pects, and all the hopes, that this World can give. Now the <HI>Dauphin</HI> and the Emperor were to di&s;pute, or to divide this Succe&s;&s;ion between them; So a new Treaty was &s;et on foot: It was generally given out, and too ea&s;ily believed, that the King of <HI>France</HI> was grown weary of War, and was re&s;olved to pa&s;s the re&s;t of his days in Peace and Quiet; But that he could not con&s;ent to the ex|altation of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria;</HI> yet if that Hou&s;e were &s;et a|&s;ide, he would yield up the <HI>Dauphin's</HI> preten&s;ions; and &s;o the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> was much talked of, but it was with the pro|&s;pect of having his Hereditary Dominions yielded up to the Crown of <HI>France:</HI> But this great matter came to another dige&s;tion a few Months after.</P>
<P>About this time, the King &s;et up a new Favourite: <HI>Keppel,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earl of <HI>Albemarle's</HI> favour.</NOTE> a Gentleman of <HI>Guelder,</HI> was rai&s;ed from being a Page, into the highe&s;t degree of favour, that any per&s;on had ever attained, about the King: He was now made Earl of <HI>Albemarle,</HI> and &s;oon after Knight of the Garter, and by a quick and unaccount|able progre&s;s, he &s;eemed to have engro&s;&s;ed the Royal Favour &s;o entirely, that he di&s;po&s;ed of every thing, that was in the King's Power. He was a cheerful young man, that had the art to plea&s;e, but was &s;o much given up to his own plea&s;ures, that he could &s;carce &s;ubmit to the attendance and drudgery, that was nece&s;&s;ary to maintain his Po&s;t. He never had yet di&s;tin|gui&s;hed him&s;elf in any thing, tho' the King did it in every thing. He was not cold nor dry, as the Earl of <HI>Portland</HI> was thought to be; who &s;eemed to have the art of creating many enemies to him&s;elf, and not one friend: But the Earl of <HI>Al|bemarle</HI> had all the Arts of a Court, was civil to all, and pro|cured many favours. The Earl of <HI>Portland</HI> ob&s;erved the pro|gre&s;s of this favour with great unea&s;ine&s;s; They grew to be not only incompatible, as all Rivals for favour mu&s;t needs be, but to hate and oppo&s;e one another in every thing; by which the King's Affairs &s;uffered much; The one had more of the confi|dence, and the other much more of the favour; The King had heaped many Grants on the Earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> and had &s;ent him Amba&s;&s;ador to <HI>France,</HI> upon the Peace; where he ap|peared with great Magnificence, and at a va&s;t Expence, and had many very unu&s;ual Re&s;pects put upon him by that King and all that Court; but upon his return, he could not bear
<PB N="225" REF="246">
the vi&s;ible &s;uperiority in favour, that the other was grown up to; So he took occa&s;ion, from a &s;mall preference that was given him, in prejudice of his own Po&s;t, as Groom of the Stole, and upon it withdrew from the Court, and laid down all his Im|ployments. The King u&s;ed all po&s;&s;ible means to divert him from this re&s;olution, but without prevailing on him; He con|&s;ented to &s;erve the King &s;till in his affairs, but he would not return to any Po&s;t in the Hou&s;hold; And not long after that he was employed in the new Negotiation, &s;et on foot for the Suc|ce&s;&s;ion to the Crown of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>This year died the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> whom the King <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Death of the Duke of <HI>Bolton.</HI></NOTE> had created Duke of <HI>Bolton;</HI> He was a man of a &s;trange mix|ture; He had the Spleen to a high degree, and affected an ex|travagant behaviour; for many weeks he would take a conceit not to &s;peak one word; and at other times, he would not open his mouth, till &s;uch an hour of the day, when he thought the Air was pure; He changed the day into night, and often hunt|ed by torch light, and took all &s;orts of Liberties to him&s;elf, many of which were very di&s;agreeable to tho&s;e about him. In the end of King <HI>Charles's</HI> time, and during King <HI>James's</HI> reign, he affected an appearance of folly, which afterwards he com|pared to <HI>Junius Brutus's</HI> behaviour under the <HI>Tarquins.</HI> With all this, he was a very knowing and a very crafty politick man: and was an artful Flatterer, when that was nece&s;&s;ary to compa&s;s his end, in which generally he was &s;ucce&s;sful: He was a man of a profu&s;e expence, and of a mo&s;t ravenous ava|rice to &s;upport that; and tho' he was much hated, yet he car|ried matters before him with &s;uch authority and &s;ucce&s;s, that he was in all re&s;pects, the great Riddle of the age.</P>
<P>This Summer, Sir <HI>Jo&s;iah Child</HI> died; He was a man of <NOTE PLACE="marg">And of Sir <HI>Jo&s;iah Child.</HI></NOTE> great Notions as to Merchandize, which was his Education, and in which he &s;ucceeded beyond any man of his time; He applied him&s;elf chiefly to the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade, which by his management was rai&s;ed &s;o high, that it drew much envy and jealou&s;y both upon him&s;elf and upon the Company; He had a compa&s;s of knowledge and apprehen&s;ion, beyond any Mer|chant I ever knew; He was vain and covetous, and thought too cunning, tho' to me he &s;eemed always &s;incere.</P>

<P>Dr. <HI>Wat&s;on</HI> was promoted by King <HI>James</HI> to the Bi&s;hoprick of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bi&s;hop of St. <HI>Da|vid's</HI> de|prived for Simony.</NOTE> St. <HI>David</HI>'s; It was believed that he gave money for his ad|vancement, and that, in order to the reimbur&s;ing him&s;elf, he &s;old mo&s;t of the &s;piritual Preferments in his Gift: By the Law and Cu&s;tom of this Church, the Archbi&s;hop is the only Judge of a Bi&s;hop, but, upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, he calls for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome of the Bi&s;hops; He called for &s;ix in this cau&s;e; I was one of them; It was proved, that the Bi&s;hop had collated a Nephew of his to a great many of the be&s;t Preferments in his Gift, and that, for many years, he had taken the whole profits of the&s;e to him&s;elf, keeping his Nephew very poor, and oblig|ing him to perform no part of his duty: It was al&s;o proved, that the Bi&s;hop obtained leave to keep a Benefice, which he held before his Promotion, by a <HI>Commendam</HI> (one of the abu&s;es, which the Popes brought in among us, from which we have not been able hitherto to free our Church) he had &s;old both the Cure, and the Profits to a Clergyman, for a &s;um of Money, and had obliged him&s;elf to re&s;ign it upon demand; That is, as &s;oon as the Clergyman could, by another &s;um, purcha&s;e the next pre&s;entation of the Patron: The&s;e things were fully prov|ed. To the&s;e, was added a charge of many oppre&s;&s;ive Fees, which being taken for Benefices, that were in his Gift, were not only Extortion but a pre&s;umptive Simony: all the&s;e he had taken him&s;elf, without making u&s;e of a Regi&s;ter or Actuary; for as he would not tru&s;t tho&s;e &s;ecrets to any other, &s;o he &s;wallowed up the Fees, both of his Chancellor and Regi&s;ter; He had al&s;o ordained many per&s;ons, without tendring them the Oaths, enjoined by Law, and yet, in their Letters of Orders, he had certified under his hand and Seal, that they had taken tho&s;e Oaths; This was, what the Law calls <HI>Crimen fal&s;i,</HI> the

certifying that, which he knew to be fal&s;e; No exceptions lay to the Witne&s;&s;es, by whom the&s;e things were made out, nor did the Bi&s;hop bring any proofs, on his &s;ide, to contradict their Evi|dence; Some affirmed, that he was a &s;ober and regular man, and that he &s;poke often of Simony, with &s;uch dete&s;tation, that they could not think him capable of committing it: The Bi|&s;hop of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> withdrew from the Court, on the day, in which Sentence was to be given; He con&s;ented to a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, but he did not think that a Bi&s;hop could be deprived, by the Archbi&s;hop: When the Court &s;ate to give Judgment, the Bi&s;hop re&s;umed his Privilege of Peerage, and pleaded it; but he, hav|ing waved it in the Hou&s;e of Lords, and having gone on &s;till &s;ubmitting to the Court; No regard was had to this, &s;ince a Plea to the Juri&s;diction of the Court, was to be offered in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, but could not be kept up to the la&s;t, and then be made u&s;e of: The Bi&s;hops, that were pre&s;ent, agreed to a &s;entence of Deprivation: I went further, and thought that he ought to be excommunicated. He was one of the wor&s;t men, in all re&s;pects, that ever I knew in Holy Orders: pa&s;&s;ionate, co|vetous, and fal&s;e in the blacke&s;t in&s;tances; without any one vertue or good quality, to balance his many bad ones. But, as he was advanced by King <HI>James,</HI> &s;o he &s;tuck firm to that Intere&s;t; and the Party, tho' a&s;hamed of him, yet were re&s;olved to &s;upport him, with great zeal: He appealed to a Court of Delegates; and they, about the end of the year, confirmed the Archbi&s;hop's &s;entence. Another pro&s;ecution followed for Si|mony, again&s;t <HI>Jones</HI> Bi&s;hop of St. <HI>A&s;aph,</HI> in which, tho' the pre&s;umptions were very great, yet the Evidence was not &s;o clear, as in the former ca&s;e; The Bi&s;hops in <HI>Wales</HI> give almo&s;t all the Benefices in their Dioce&s;e; So this Primitive Con&s;titu|tion, that is &s;till pre&s;erved among them, was &s;candalou&s;ly abu&s;ed by &s;ome wicked men, who &s;et holy things to &s;ale, and thereby encrea&s;ed the prejudices, that are but too ea&s;ily received, both again&s;t Religion and the Church.</P>
<P>I publi&s;hed this year an Expo&s;ition of the Thirty nine Arti|cles <NOTE PLACE="marg">I publi&s;hed an Expo&s;i|tion of the Thirty nine Articles.</NOTE> of Religion: It &s;eemed a Work much wanted, and it was ju&s;tly to be wondred at, that none of our Divines had at|tempted any &s;uch Performance, in a way &s;uitable to the digni|ty of the &s;ubject: For &s;ome &s;light Analy&s;es of them are not worth, either mentioning or reading. It was a work, that re|quired &s;tudy and labour, and laid a man open to many mali|cious attacks; This made &s;ome of my friends advi&s;e me again&s;t publi&s;hing it; In compliance with them, I kept it five years by me, after I had fini&s;hed it: But I was now prevail'd on by
<PB N="228" REF="249">
the Archbi&s;hop and many of my own Order, be&s;ides a great many others, to delay the publi&s;hing it no longer. It &s;eemed a proper addition to the Hi&s;tory of the Reformation, to explain and prove the Doctrine, which was then e&s;tabli&s;hed. I was moved fir&s;t, by the late Queen, and pre&s;&s;ed by the late Arch|bi&s;hop to write it; I can appeal to the Searcher of all hearts, that I wrote it, with great &s;incerity and a good intention; and with all the application and care, I was capable of; I did then expect, what I have &s;ince met with, that malicious men would imploy both their indu&s;try and ill-nature, to find matter for cen&s;ure and cavils; But tho' there have been &s;ome Books writ on purpo&s;e again&s;t it, and many in Sermons and other Treati|&s;es have occa&s;ionally reflected, with great &s;everity, upon &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages in it, yet this has been done, with &s;o little ju&s;tice or rea&s;on, that I am not yet convinced, that there is one &s;ingle period or expre&s;&s;ion, that is ju&s;tly remarked on, or that can give me any occa&s;ion, either to retract, or &s;o much as to ex|plain any one part of that whole Work; which I was very ready to have done, if I had &s;een cau&s;e for it. There was another rea&s;on, that &s;eemed to determine me to the publi&s;hing it at this time.</P>
<P>Upon the Peace of <HI>Ry&s;wick,</HI> a great &s;warm of Prie&s;ts came <NOTE PLACE="marg">The growth of Popery.</NOTE> over to <HI>England,</HI> not only tho&s;e, whom the Revolution had frighted away, but many more new men, who appeared in many places with great in&s;olence; And it was &s;aid, that they boa&s;ted of the favour and protection, of which they were a&s;&s;ur|ed. Some enemies of the Government began to give it out, that the favouring that Religion was a &s;ecret Article of the Peace; and &s;o ab&s;urd is malice and calumny, that the Jaco|bites began to &s;ay, that the King was either of that Religion, or at lea&s;t a favourer of it: Complaints of the avowed practices and in&s;olence of the Prie&s;ts were brought from &s;everal places, during the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, and tho&s;e were malici|ou&s;ly aggravated by &s;ome, who ca&s;t the blame of all on the King.</P>
<P>Upon this, &s;ome propo&s;ed a Bill, that obliged all per&s;ons <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Act a|gain&s;t Pa|pi$span$.</NOTE> educated in that Religion, or &s;u&s;pected to be of it, who &s;hould &s;ucceed to any E&s;tate before they were of the age of eighteen, to take the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, and the Te&s;t, as &s;oon as they came to that age; and till they did it, the E&s;tate was to devolve to the next of kin, that was a Prote&s;tant; but was to return back to them, upon their taking the Oaths. All popi&s;h Prie&s;ts were al&s;o bani&s;hed by the Bill, and were adjudged to perpetual impri&s;onment, if they &s;hould

again return into <HI>England;</HI> and the reward of an hundred pound was offered to every one, who &s;hould di&s;cover a Popi&s;h Prie&s;t, &s;o as to convict him. Tho&s;e, who brought this into the Hou&s;e of Commons, hoped, that the Court would have oppo&s;|ed it; But the Court promoted the Bill; So when the Party &s;aw their mi&s;take, they &s;eemed willing to let the Bill fall; and when that could not be done, they clogged it with many &s;evere and &s;ome unrea&s;onable Clau&s;es, hoping that the Lords would not pa&s;s the Act; And it was &s;aid, that if the Lords &s;hould make the lea&s;t alteration in it, they, in the Hou&s;e of Commons, who had &s;et it on, were re&s;olved to let it lie on their Table, when it &s;hould be &s;ent back to them. Many Lords, who &s;e|cretly favoured Papi&s;ts, on the Jacobite account, did for this very rea&s;on, move for &s;everal alterations; Some of the&s;e im|porting a greater &s;everity; But the zeal again&s;t Popery was &s;uch in that Hou&s;e, that the Bill pa&s;t without any amendment, and it had the Royal A&s;&s;ent. I was for this Bill, notwith&s;tand|ing my Principles for Toleration, and again&s;t all Per&s;ecution for Con&s;cience &s;ake; I had always thought, that if a Government found any Sect in Religion, incompatible with its quiet and &s;afety, it might, and &s;ometimes ought to &s;end away all of that Sect, with as little hard&s;hip as po&s;&s;ible; It it certain, that as all Papi&s;ts mu&s;t, at all times, be ill &s;ubjects to a Prote&s;tant Prince, &s;o this is much more to be apprehended, when there is a pretended Popi&s;h Heir in the ca&s;e; This Act hurt no man, that was in the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an E&s;tate, it only incapaci|tated his next Heir, to &s;ucceed to that E&s;tate, if he continued a Papi&s;t; So the danger of this, in ca&s;e the Act &s;hould be well looked to, would put tho&s;e of that Religion, who are men of Con&s;cience, on the &s;elling their E&s;tates; and in the cour&s;e of a few years, might deliver us from having any Papi&s;ts left among us. But this Act wanted &s;everal nece&s;&s;ary Clau&s;es, to enforce the due execution of it; The word <HI>next of kin,</HI> was very in|definite, and the <HI>next of kin</HI> was not obliged to claim the be|nefit of this Act, nor did the Right de&s;cend to the remoter Heirs, if the more immediate ones &s;hould not take the benefit of it; The Te&s;t, relating to matters of Doctrine and Wor&s;hip, did not &s;eem a proper ground for &s;o great a &s;everity; So this Act was not followed nor executed in any &s;ort; But here is a Scheme laid, tho' not fully dige&s;ted, which on &s;ome great pro|vocation, given by tho&s;e of that Religion, may di&s;pose $word$ Par|liament to put &s;uch Clau&s;es in a new Act, as may make this effectual.</P>

<PB N="231" REF="252">
had treated that principality, in the &s;ame rough manner, in which he had oppre&s;&s;ed his other Dominions; So it was thought, that the <HI>Livonians</HI> were di&s;po&s;ed (as &s;oon as they &s;aw a power ready to protect them, and to re&s;tore them to their former Liberties) to &s;hake off the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Yoke; e&s;pecially, if they &s;aw the King attack'd in &s;o many different places at once.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Poland</HI> had a farther de&s;ign in this Inva&s;ion: <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of <HI>Poland</HI>'s de&s;igns.</NOTE> He had an Army of <HI>Saxons</HI> in <HI>Poland,</HI> to whom he chiefly tru&s;ted, in carrying on his De&s;igns there; The <HI>Poles</HI> were be|come &s;o jealous, both of him and of his <HI>Saxons,</HI> that in a general Diet, they had come to very &s;evere Re&s;olutions, in ca&s;e the <HI>Saxons</HI> were not &s;ent out of the Kingdom, by a prefixed day; That King therefore reckoned, that as the reduction of <HI>Livonia</HI> had the fair appearance, of recovering the antient inhe|ritance of the Crown; So by this means, he would carry the <HI>Saxons</HI> out of <HI>Poland,</HI> as was decreed, and yet have them with|in call: He likewi&s;e &s;tudied to engage tho&s;e of <HI>Lithuania,</HI> to join with him in the attempt. His chief dependance was on the <HI>Czar,</HI> who had a&s;&s;ured him, that if he could make Peace with the <HI>Turk,</HI> and keep <HI>Azuph,</HI> he would a&s;&s;i&s;t him power|fully again&s;t the <HI>Swedes;</HI> His de&s;ign being to recover <HI>Narva,</HI> which is capable of being made a good Port. By this means, he hoped to get into the <HI>Baltick,</HI> where if he could once &s;ettle, he would &s;oon become an unea&s;y Neighbour, to all the nor|thern Princes: The King of <HI>Poland</HI> went into <HI>Saxony,</HI> to mortgage and &s;ell his Lands there, and to rai&s;e as much money, as was po&s;&s;ible, for carrying on this War; and he brought the Electorate to &s;o low a &s;tate, that if his De&s;igns in <HI>Poland</HI> mi&s;|carry; and if he is driven back into <HI>Saxony,</HI> he, who was the riche&s;t Prince of the Empire, will become one of the poore&s;t. But the Amu&s;ements of Balls and Opera's con&s;umed &s;o much, both of his Time and Trea&s;ure, that whereas the De&s;ign was laid to &s;urprize <HI>Riga,</HI> in the middle of the Winter, he did not begin his attempt upon it, before the end of <HI>February,</HI> and the&s;e De&s;igns went no farther this year.</P>
<P>While the King was at <HI>Loo</HI> this Summer, a new Treaty was <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parti|tion Treaty.</NOTE> &s;et on foot, concerning the Succe&s;&s;ion to the Crown of <HI>Spain;</HI> The King and the States of the United Provinces &s;aw the dan|ger, to which they would be expo&s;ed, if they &s;hould engage in a new War, while we were yet under the va&s;t Debts, that the former had brought upon us; The King's Mini&s;ters in the Hou&s;e of Commons a&s;&s;ured him, that it would be a very dif|ficult thing to bring them, to enter into a new War, for main|taining
<PB N="232" REF="253">
the rights of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria.</HI> During the De|bates concerning the Army, when &s;ome mentioned the danger of that Monarchy falling into the hands of a Prince of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> it was &s;et up for a maxim, that it would be of no con&s;equence to the affairs of <HI>Europe,</HI> who was King of <HI>Spain,</HI> whether a <HI>Frenchman</HI> or a <HI>German;</HI> And that as &s;oon as the Succe&s;&s;or &s;hould come within <HI>Spain,</HI> he would become a true <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and be governed by the Maxims and Intere&s;ts of that Crown; So that there was no pro&s;pect of being able to infu&s;e into the Nation an apprehen&s;ion of the con&s;equence of that Succe&s;&s;ion. The Emperor had a very good claim; but as he had little &s;trength to &s;upport it by Land, &s;o he had none at all by Sea; and his Trea&s;ure was quite exhau&s;ted, by his long War with the <HI>Turk:</HI> The <HI>French</HI> drew a great Force towards the Frontiers of <HI>Spain,</HI> and they were re&s;olved to march into it, upon that King's death: There was no &s;trength ready to oppo&s;e them, yet they &s;eemed willing to compound the matter; But they &s;aid, the con&s;ideration mu&s;t be very valuable, that could make them de&s;i&s;t from &s;o great a Preten&s;ion; and both the King and the States thought it was a good Bargain, if, by yield|ing up &s;ome of the le&s;s important branches of that Monarchy, they could &s;ave tho&s;e in which they were mo&s;t concerned, which were <HI>Spain</HI> it&s;elf, the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and the <HI>Netherlands.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> &s;eemed willing to accept of the Dominions in and about <HI>Italy,</HI> with a part of the Kingdom of <HI>Navarre,</HI> and to yield up the re&s;t to the Emperor's &s;econd Son, the Archduke <HI>Charles;</HI> The Emperor entred into the Treaty, for he &s;aw he could not hope to carry the whole Succe&s;&s;ion entire; but he pre&s;&s;ed to have the Dutchy of <HI>Milan</HI> added to his hereditary Dominions in <HI>Germany;</HI> The expedient that the King propo&s;ed was, that the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> &s;hould have the Dutchy of <HI>Milan,</HI> and that <HI>France</HI> &s;hould accept of <HI>Lorrain</HI> in&s;tead of it; He was the Emperor's Nephew, and would be entirely in his Intere&s;ts; The Emperor did not agree to this, but yet he pre&s;&s;ed the King, not to give over the Treaty, and to try if he could make a better Bargain for him; above all things, he recommended Secrecy, for he well knew how much the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would be offended, if any Treaty &s;hould be owned, that might bring on a di&s;membring of their Monarchy; for tho' they were taking no care to pre&s;erve it, in whole or in part, yet they could not bear the having any branch torn from it. The King rec|koned that the Emperor, with the other Princes of <HI>Italy,</HI> might have &s;o much intere&s;t in <HI>Rome,</HI> as to &s;top the Pope's giving the Inve&s;titure of the Kingdom of <HI>Naples;</HI> And which way &s;oever
<PB N="233" REF="254">
that matter might end, it would oblige the Pope to &s;hew great partiality, either to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> or the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bour|bon;</HI> which might occa&s;ion a breach among them, with other con&s;equences, that might be very happy to the whole Prote&s;|tant Intere&s;t; Any War, that might follow in <HI>Italy,</HI> would be at great di&s;tance from us, and in a Country, that we had no rea&s;on to regard much; Be&s;ides, that the Fleets of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> mu&s;t come, in conclu&s;ion, to be the Arbiters of the matter.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the King's &s;ecret motives; For I had mo&s;t of them from his own mouth: The <HI>French</HI> con&s;ented to this Scheme, and if the Emperor would have agreed to it, his Son the Archduke was immediately to go to <HI>Spain,</HI> to be con&s;idered as the Heir of that Crown: By the&s;e Articles, &s;igned both by the King of <HI>France</HI> and the <HI>Dauphin,</HI> they bound them&s;elves, not to accept of any Will, Te&s;tament, or Donation, contrary to this Treaty, which came to be called the <HI>Partition Treaty.</HI> I had the Original in my hands, which the <HI>Dauphin</HI> &s;igned; The <HI>French</HI> and the Emperor tried their &s;trength in the Court of <HI>Spain;</HI> It is plain, the Emperor tru&s;ted too much to his In|tere&s;t in that Court, and in that King him&s;elf; And he refu&s;ed to accept of the Partition, meerly to ingratiate him&s;elf with them; otherwi&s;e, it was not doubted, but that, &s;eeing the im|po&s;&s;ibility of mending matters, he would have yielded to the nece&s;&s;ity of his affairs. The <HI>French</HI> did, in a mo&s;t perfidious manner, &s;tudy to alienate the <HI>Spaniards</HI> from their Allies, by &s;hewing them to how great a diminution of their Monarchy they had con&s;ented; So that no way po&s;&s;ible was left, for them to keep tho&s;e Dominions &s;till united to their Crown, but by accepting the Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI> to be their King, with whom all &s;hould be again re&s;tored. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> complained in the Courts of their Allies, in ours in particular, of this Partition, as a dete&s;table Project; which was to rob them of tho&s;e Domi|nions, that belonged to their Crown, and ought not to be torn from it; No mention was made of this, during the Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, for tho' the thing was generally believed, yet it not being publickly owned, no notice could be taken of bare Reports; and nothing was to be done, in pur&s;uance of this Treaty, dur|ing the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Life.</P>
<P>In <HI>Scotland,</HI> all men were full of hopes, that their new <NOTE PLACE="marg">The affairs of <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> Colony &s;hould bring them home mountains of Gold; The Pro|clamations, &s;ent to <HI>Jamaica</HI> and to the other <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Planta|tions, were much complained of, as acts of Ho&s;tility and a Violation of the common Rights of humanity; The&s;e had a
<PB N="234" REF="255">
great effect on them, tho' without the&s;e, that Colony was too weak and too ill &s;upplied, as well as too much divided within it&s;elf, to have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted long; Tho&s;e, who had fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of it, were forced to abandon it; Soon after they had gone from it, a &s;econd Recruit of Men and Provi&s;ions was &s;ent thither from <HI>Scotland;</HI> But one of their Ships unhap|pily took Fire, in which they had the greate&s;t &s;tock of Provi|&s;ions; And &s;o the&s;e likewi&s;e went off: And tho' the third Re|inforcement, that &s;oon followed this, was both &s;tronger and better furni&s;hed, yet they fell into &s;uch Factions among them&s;elves, that they were too weak to re&s;i&s;t the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who feeble as they were, yet &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of attacking them: And they finding them&s;elves unable to re&s;i&s;t the Force, which was brought again&s;t them, capitulated; and with that the whole De&s;ign fell to the ground, partly for want of &s;tock and skill in tho&s;e who managed it, and partly by the ba&s;ene&s;s and treachery of tho&s;e whom they imployed.</P>
<P>The conduct of the King's Mini&s;ters in <HI>Scotland</HI> was much cen&s;ured, in the whole progre&s;s of this affair; For they had <NOTE PLACE="marg">Great di&s;|content upon the lo&s;s of <HI>Darien.</HI></NOTE> connived at it, if not encouraged it, in hopes that the De&s;ign would fall of it&s;elf, but now it was not &s;o ea&s;y, to cure the uni|ver&s;al di&s;content, which the mi&s;carriage of this De&s;ign, to the impoveri&s;hing the whole Kingdom, had rai&s;ed, and which now began to &s;pread like a Contagion, among all &s;orts of people. A Petition for a pre&s;ent Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament was immediately &s;ent about the Kingdom, and was &s;igned by many thou&s;ands: This was &s;ent up, by &s;ome of the chief of their Nobility, whom the King received very coldly: Yet a Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament was granted them, to which the Duke of <HI>Queensbury</HI> was &s;ent down Commi&s;&s;ioner. Great pains were taken, by all &s;orts of practices, to be &s;ure of a Majority; Great offers were made them in order to lay the di&s;contents, which ran then very high; A Law for a <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> with a great Freedom for Trade, and every thing, that they could demand, was offered, to per|&s;uade them to de&s;i&s;t, from pur&s;uing the de&s;ign upon <HI>Darien.</HI> The Court had tried, to get the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> to in|terpo&s;e in that matter, and to declare them&s;elves again&s;t that Undertaking; The Hou&s;e of Lords was prevailed on, to make an Addre&s;s to the King, repre&s;enting the ill effects that they apprehended from that Settlement; But this did not &s;ignify much, for as it was carried in that Hou&s;e by a &s;mall Majority of &s;even or eight, &s;o it was laid a&s;ide by the Hou&s;e of Commons. Some were not ill plea&s;ed, to &s;ee the King's affairs run into an embroilment; And others did apprehend, that there was a De|&s;ign
<PB N="235" REF="256">
to involve the two Kingdoms, in a National quarrel, that by &s;uch an artifice, a greater Army might be rai&s;ed, and kept up on both &s;ides; So they let that matter fall, nor would they give any entertainment to a Bill, that was &s;ent them by the Lords, in order to a Treaty for the Union of both Kingdoms. The managers in the Hou&s;e of Commons, who oppo&s;ed the Court, re&s;olved to do nothing, that &s;hould provoke <HI>Scotland,</HI> or that &s;hould take any part of the blame and general di&s;con|tent, that &s;oured that Nation, off from the King: It was fur|ther given out, to rai&s;e the National di&s;gu&s;t yet higher, that the oppo&s;ition the King gave to the <HI>Scotch</HI> Colony, flowed nei|ther from a regard to the Intere&s;ts of <HI>England,</HI> nor to the Trea|ties with <HI>Spain,</HI> but from a care of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who from <HI>Cu|ra&s;oe</HI> drove a coa&s;ting Trade, among the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Plantations, with great advantage; which, they &s;aid, the <HI>Scotch</HI> Colony, if once well &s;ettled, would draw wholly from them. The&s;e things were &s;et about that Nation with great indu&s;try; The ma|nagement was chiefly in the hands of Jacobites; Neither the King nor his Mini&s;ters were treated with the decencies, that are &s;ometimes ob&s;erved, even after Subjects have run to Arms; The keene&s;t of their rage was plainly pointed at the King him|&s;elf; Next him the Earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> who had &s;till the direc|tion of their affairs, had a large &s;hare of it. In the Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, it was carried by a Vote, to make the affair of <HI>Da|rien</HI> a national concern; Upon that, the Se&s;&s;ion was for &s;ome|time di&s;continued; When the news of the total abandoning of <HI>Darien</HI> was brought over, it cannot be well expre&s;&s;ed, into how bad a temper this ca&s;t the body of that people; They had now lo&s;t almo&s;t two hundred thou&s;and pounds Sterling, upon this Project, be&s;ides all the imaginary trea&s;ure, they had pro|mi&s;ed them&s;elves from it: So the Nation was rai&s;ed into a &s;ort of a fury upon it, and in the fir&s;t heat of that, a remon&s;trance was &s;ent about the Kingdom for hands, repre&s;enting to the King, the nece&s;&s;ity of a pre&s;ent &s;itting of the Parliament, which was drawn in &s;o high a &s;train, as if they had re&s;olved to pur&s;ue the effects of it, by an armed Force. It was &s;igned by a great Majority of the Members of Parliament, and the ferment in mens &s;pirits was rai&s;ed &s;o high, that few thought it could have been long curbed, without breaking forth into great extremi|ties.</P>
<P>The King &s;tay'd beyond Sea till <HI>November;</HI> Many expected <NOTE PLACE="marg">A S$&s;&s;ion $word$ Parliament.</NOTE> to &s;ee a new Parliament; For the King's Speech at the end of the former Se&s;&s;ion looked like a Complaint, and an Appeal to the Nation again&s;t them; He &s;eemed inclined to it, but his
<PB N="236" REF="257">
Mini&s;ters would not venture on it; The di&s;&s;olving a Parliament in anger has always ca&s;t &s;uch a load on tho&s;e, who were thought to have advi&s;ed it, that few have been able to bear it; be&s;ides, the disbanding the Army had render'd the Members, who pro|moted it, very popular to the Nation; So that they would have &s;ent up the &s;ame men, and it was thought that there was little occa&s;ion for heat in another Se&s;&s;ion; But tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed the King, re&s;olved to force a change of the Mini&s;try upon him; They were &s;eeking Colours for this, and thought they had found one, with which they had made much noi&s;e; It was this.</P>
<P>Some Pirates had got together in the <HI>Indian</HI> Seas, and rob|bed &s;ome of the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Ships, in particular one, that he was <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Com|plaint made of &s;ome Pi|rates.</NOTE> &s;ending with Pre&s;ents to <HI>Mecca;</HI> mo&s;t of them were <HI>Engli&s;h:</HI> The <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company, having repre&s;ented the danger of the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s taking Repri&s;als of them, for the&s;e Lo&s;&s;es, it appeared that there was a nece&s;&s;ity of de&s;troying tho&s;e Pirates, who were harbouring them&s;elves in &s;ome creeks in <HI>Madaga&s;car.</HI> So a Man of War was to be &s;et out to de&s;troy them, and one <HI>Kid</HI> was pitched upon, who knew their haunts, and was thought a proper man for the &s;ervice; But there was not a Fund, to bear the charge of this; For the Parliament had &s;o appropriat|ed the money given for the Sea, that no part of it could be applied to this expedition. The King propo&s;ed the managing it, by a private undertaking, and &s;aid he would lay down three thou&s;and pounds him&s;elf, and recommended it to his Mi|ni&s;ters, to find out the re&s;t: In compliance with this, the Lord <HI>Somers,</HI> the Earls of <HI>Orford, Rumney, Bellamount,</HI> and &s;ome others contributed the whole expence; For the King excu&s;ed him&s;elf, by rea&s;on of other accidents, and did not advance the &s;um, that he had promi&s;ed: Lord <HI>Somers</HI> under&s;tood nothing of the matter, and left it wholly to the management of others, &s;o that he never &s;aw <HI>Kid,</HI> only he thought it became the Po&s;t he was in, to concur in &s;uch a publick Service. A Grant was made to the Undertakers, of all that &s;hould be taken from tho&s;e Pirates, by their Ship. Here was a handle for Complaint, for as it was again&s;t Law, to take a Grant of the Goods of any Offenders before Conviction, &s;o a parity between that and this ca&s;e was urged: but without any rea&s;on: The Provi&s;ions of Law being very different, in the ca&s;e of Pirates and that of o|ther Criminals. The former cannot be attackt, but in the way of War; and therefore &s;ince tho&s;e, who undertook this, mu&s;t run a great ri&s;que in executing it, it was rea&s;onable, and ac|cording to the Law of War, that they &s;hould have a right to all, that they found in the Enemies hands, whereas tho&s;e, who
<PB N="237" REF="258">
&s;eize common Offenders, have &s;uch a &s;trength by the Law, to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, and incur &s;o little danger in doing it, that no ju&s;t inference can be drawn from the one ca&s;e to the other. When this <HI>Kid</HI> was thus &s;et out, he turned Pirate him&s;elf; So a hea|vy load was ca&s;t on the Mini&s;try, chiefly on him, who was at the head of the Ju&s;tice of the Nation; It was &s;aid, he ought not to have engaged in &s;uch a Project; And it was maliciou&s;ly in&s;inuated, that the Privateer turned Pirate, in confidence of the protection of tho&s;e, who imployed him, if he had not &s;ecret Orders from them for what he did. Such black con&s;tructions are men, who are engaged in Parties, apt to make of the actions of tho&s;e, whom they intend to di&s;grace, even again&s;t their own Con&s;ciences: So that an Undertaking, that was not only inno|cent but meritorious, was traduced as a de&s;ign for Robbery and Piracy. This was urged in the Hou&s;e of Commons as highly criminal, for which all, who were concerned in it, ought to be turned out of their Imployments; and a Que&s;tion was put upon it, but it was rejected by a great Majority. The next attempt was to turn me out from the Tru&s;t of Educating the Duke of <HI>Gloce&s;ter:</HI> Some objected my being a <HI>Scotchman,</HI> others remember'd the Book that was ordered to be burnt; So they pre&s;&s;ed an Addre&s;s to the King, for removing me from that Po&s;t; but this was likewi&s;e lo&s;t by the &s;ame Majority, that had carried the former Vote. The pay for the &s;mall Army, and the expence of the Fleet, were &s;ettled: And a Fund was given for it; Yet tho&s;e, who had reduced the Army, thought it needle&s;s to have &s;o great a Force at Sea; They provided only for eight thou&s;and men; This was moved by the Tories, and the Whigs readily gave way to this reduction, becau&s;e the Fleet was now in another management; <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> (now Earl of <HI>Orford)</HI> with his friends being laid a&s;ide, and a &s;et of Tories being brought into their places.</P>
<P>The great bu&s;ine&s;s of this Se&s;&s;ion was the Report brought <NOTE PLACE="marg">1700</NOTE> from <HI>Ireland,</HI> by four of the &s;even Commi&s;&s;ioners, that were &s;ent by Parliament, to examine into the Confi&s;cations, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Debates con|cerning E|&s;tates in <HI>Ire|land.</HI></NOTE> the Grants made of them. Three of the &s;even refu&s;ed to &s;ign it, becau&s;e they thought it fal&s;e, and ill grounded in many par|ticulars, of which they &s;ent over an account to both Hou&s;es; But no regard was had to that, nor was any enquiry made into their objections to the Report. The&s;e three were looked on, as men gained by the Court; And the re&s;t were magnified, as men that could not be wrought on, nor frighted from their duty. They had proceeded like Inqui&s;itors, and did rea|dily
<PB N="238" REF="259">
believe every thing, that was offered to them, that tended to inflame the Report; as they &s;uppre&s;&s;ed all, that was laid be|fore them, that contradicted their de&s;ign, of repre&s;enting the value of the Grants as very high, and of &s;hewing how unde|&s;erving tho&s;e were, who had obtained them: There was &s;o much truth, in the main of this, that no Complaints again&s;t their proceedings could be hearkned to; And indeed, all the methods that were taken, to di&s;grace the Report, had the quite contrary effect: They repre&s;ented the Confi&s;cated E&s;tates to be &s;uch, that out of the Sale of them, a Million and a half might be rai&s;ed; So this &s;pecious Propo&s;ition, for di&s;charging &s;o great a part of the Publick Debt, took with the Hou&s;e; The ha|tred, into which the Favourites were fallen, among whom and their Creatures the Grants were chiefly di&s;tributed, made the motion go the quicker; All the oppo&s;ition that was made, in the whole progre&s;s of this matter, was looked on as a court|ing the men in favour; nor was any regard paid to the re&s;erve of a third part, to be di&s;po&s;ed of by the King, which had been in the Bill that was &s;ent up eight years before to the Lords. When this was mentioned, it was an&s;wered, that the Gran|tees had enjoyed tho&s;e E&s;tates &s;o many years, that the mean profits did ari&s;e to more than a third part of their value: Lit|tle regard al&s;o was &s;hewn to the Purcha&s;es made under tho&s;e Grants, and to the great improvements, made by the Purcha|&s;ers or Tenants, which were &s;aid to have doubled the value of tho&s;e E&s;tates. All that was &s;aid, on that head, made no im|pre&s;&s;ion, and was &s;carce heard with patience: Yet, that &s;ome ju&s;tice might be done both to Purcha&s;ers and Creditors, a num|ber of Tru&s;tees were named, in whom all the confi&s;cated E|&s;tates <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Act $span$ them $n Tru&s;tees.</NOTE> were ve&s;ted, and they had a very great and uncontroula|ble Authority lodged with them, of hearing and determin|ing all ju&s;t claims, relating to tho&s;e E&s;tates, and of &s;elling them to the be&s;t Purcha&s;ers; And the money to be rai&s;ed by this Sale, was appropriated to pay the Arrears of the Army. When all this was dige&s;ted into a Bill, the Party apprehended, that many Petitions would be offered to the Hou&s;e, which the Court would probably encourage, on de&s;ign at lea&s;t to retard their proceedings: So, to prevent this, and that they might not lo&s;e too much time, nor clog the Bill with too many Clau&s;es and Provi&s;o's, they pa&s;&s;ed a Vote of a very extraordinary na|t$$e; That they would receive no Petitions, relating to the matter of this Bill. The Ca&s;e of the Earl of <HI>Athlone</HI>'s Grant was very &s;ingular; The Hou&s;e of Commons had been &s;o &s;en&s;i|ble of his good &s;ervice, in reducing <HI>Ireland,</HI> that they had
<PB N="239" REF="260">
made an Addre&s;s to the King, to give him a recompence, &s;uit|able to his Services: And the Parliament of <HI>Ireland</HI> was &s;o &s;en|&s;ible of their obligations to him, that they, as was formerly told, confirmed his Grant, of between two and three thou&s;and pounds a year. He had &s;old it to tho&s;e, who thought they purcha&s;ed under an unque&s;tionable Title, yet all that was now &s;et a&s;ide, no regard being had to it; So that this E&s;tate was thrown into the heap. Some Exceptions were made, in the Bill, in favour of &s;ome Grants, and Provi&s;ion was made for reward|ing others, whom the King, as they thought, had not enough con&s;idered. Great oppo&s;ition was made to this by &s;ome, who thought that all Favours and Grants ought to be given by the King, and not originally by a Hou&s;e of Parliament, and this was managed with great heat, even by &s;ome of tho&s;e, who concurred in carrying on the Bill: In conclu&s;ion it was, by a new term as well as a new invention, con&s;olidated with the Money Bill, that was to go for the pay of the Fleet and Army, and &s;o it came up to the Hou&s;e of Lords; which by con&s;e|quence they mu&s;t either pa&s;s or reject. The method, that the Court took in that Hou&s;e to oppo&s;e it, was, to offer &s;ome Al|terations, that were indeed very ju&s;t and rea&s;onable; but &s;ince the Hou&s;e of Commons would not &s;uffer the Lords to alter Money Bills, this was in effect to lo&s;e it. The Court, upon &s;ome previous Votes, found they had a Majority among the Lords; So, for &s;ome days, it &s;eemed to be de&s;igned to lo&s;e the Bill, and to venture on a Prorogation or a Di&s;&s;olution, rather than pa&s;s it. Upon the apprehen&s;ions of this, the Commons were beginning to fly out into high Votes, both again&s;t the Mi|ni&s;ters and the Favourites; The Lord <HI>Somers</HI> was attack'd a &s;e|cond time, but was brought off by a greater Majority, than had appeared for him, at the beginning of the Se&s;&s;ion. Dur|ing the Debates about the Bill, he was ill; And the wor&s;t con|&s;truction po&s;&s;ible was put on that; it was &s;aid, he advi&s;ed all the oppo&s;ition that was made to it, in the Hou&s;e of Lords, but that, to keep him&s;elf out of it, he feigned that he was ill: Tho' his great attendance in the Court of Chancery, the Hou&s;e of Lords, and at the Council Table, had &s;o impaired his health, that every year, about that time, he u&s;ed to be brought very low, and di&s;abled from bu&s;ine&s;s. The King &s;eemed re&s;olved, to venture on all the ill con&s;equences, that might follow the lo&s;ing this Bill; tho' tho&s;e would probably have been fatal. As far as we could judge, either another Se&s;&s;ion of that Parliament, or a new One, would have bani&s;hed the Favourites, and be|gun the Bill anew, with the addition of obliging the Gran|tees,
<PB N="240" REF="261">
to refund all the mean profits: Many in the Hou&s;e of Lords, that in all other things were very firm to the King, were for pa&s;&s;ing this Bill, notwith&s;tanding the King's earne&s;tne&s;s a|gain&s;t it, &s;ince they apprehended the ill con&s;equences, that were like to follow, if it was lo&s;t. I was one of the&s;e, and the King was much di&s;plea&s;ed with me for it: I &s;aid, I would ven|ture his di&s;plea&s;ure, rather than plea&s;e him in that, which I feared would be the ruine of his Government: I confe&s;s, I did not at that time apprehend, what inju&s;tice lay under many of the Clau&s;es in the Bill, which appeared afterwards &s;o evidently, that the very &s;ame per&s;ons, who drove on the Bill, were con|vinced of them, and redre&s;&s;ed &s;ome of them in Acts, that pa&s;&s;|ed in &s;ub&s;equent Se&s;&s;ions: If I had under&s;tood that matter a|right and in time, I had never given my Vote for &s;o unju&s;t a Bill. I only con&s;idered it as a hard&s;hip put on the King, ma|ny of his Grants being thus made void; &s;ome of which had not been made on good and rea&s;onable con&s;iderations, &s;o that they could hardly be excu&s;ed, much le&s;s ju&s;tified; I thought the thing was a &s;ort of force, to which it &s;eemed rea&s;onable to give way, at that time, &s;ince we were not furni&s;hed with an equal &s;trength, to with&s;tand it: But when I &s;aw afterwards, what the con&s;equences of this Act proved to be; I did firmly re&s;olve, never to con&s;ent again to any tack to a Money Bill, as long as I lived. The King became &s;ullen upon all this, and upon the many incidents, that are apt to fall in upon Debates of this nature: He either did not apprehend, in what &s;uch things might end, or he was not much concerned at it: His re|&s;entment, which was much provoked, broke out into &s;ome in|&s;tances, which gave &s;uch handles to his Enemies, as they wi&s;h|ed for; and they improved tho&s;e advantages, which his ill con|duct gave them, with much &s;pite and indu&s;try, &s;o as to alie|nate the Nation from him. It was once in agitation among the Party, to make an Addre&s;s to him, again&s;t going beyond Sea, but even that was diverted, with a malicious de&s;ign. Hi|therto the Body of the Nation retained a great mea&s;ure of af|fection to him; This was beginning to dimini&s;h, by his going &s;o con&s;tantly beyond Sea, as &s;oon as the Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament was ended; tho' the War was now over. Upon this, it grew to be publickly &s;aid, that he loved no <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI>'s face, nor his company; So his Enemies reckoned it was fit for their ends, to let that prejudice go on, and encrea&s;e in the minds of the peo|ple; till they might find a proper occa&s;ion, to graft &s;ome bad de&s;igns upon it. The Se&s;&s;ion ended in <HI>April;</HI> Men of all &s;ides, being put into a very ill humour by the proceedings in it.</P>

The Leaders of the Tories began to in&s;inuate to the Favou|rites, the nece&s;&s;ity of the King's changing his Mini&s;try, in par|ticular of removing the Lord <HI>Somers,</HI> who, as he was now con&s;i|dered <NOTE PLACE="marg">A change in the Mini&s;try.</NOTE> as the Head of the Whigs, &s;o his wi&s;e Coun&s;els, and his mode&s;t way of laying them before the King, had gained him a great &s;hare of his e&s;teem and confidence; and it was rec|koned, that the chief &s;trength of the Party lay in his credit with the King, and in the prudent methods he took, to govern the Party, and to moderate that heat and tho&s;e jealou&s;ies, with which the King had been &s;o long di&s;gu&s;ted, in the fir&s;t years of his Reign. In the Hou&s;e of Commons, he had been parti|cularly charged, for turning many Gentlemen out of the Com|mi&s;&s;ion of the Peace; This was much aggravated, and rai&s;ed a very high complaint again&s;t him; but there was no ju&s;t cau&s;e for it: When the de&s;ign of the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination and Inva&s;ion, in the year 1695 and 1696 was di&s;covered, a voluntary A&s;&s;ociation was entred into, by both Hou&s;es of Parliament, and that was &s;et round the Nation: In &s;uch a time of danger, it was thought, that tho&s;e, who did not enter voluntarily into it, were &s;o ill affected, or at lea&s;t &s;o little zealous for the King, that it was not fit, they &s;hould continue Ju&s;tices of Peace: So an Order pa&s;&s;ed in Council, that all tho&s;e, who had &s;o refu&s;ed, &s;hould be turned out of the Commi&s;&s;ion: He had obeyed this Order, upon the repre&s;entations made to him, by the Lords Lieute|nants and the <HI>Cu&s;todes Rotulorum</HI> of the &s;everal Counties, who were not all equally di&s;creet: Yet he laid tho&s;e repre&s;entations before the Council, and had a &s;pecial Order, for every per&s;on, that was &s;o turned out. All this was now magnified, and it was charged on him, that he had advi&s;ed and procured the&s;e Orders, yet this could not be made &s;o much as a colour to pro|ceed again&s;t him, a clamour and murmuring was all that could be rai&s;ed from it. But now the Tories &s;tudied to get it infu&s;ed into the King, that all the hard things, that had been of late put on him by the Parliament, were occa&s;ioned by the hatred, that was born to his Mini&s;ters; and that if he would change hands, and imploy others, matters might be &s;oftned and mend|ed in another Parliament: With this the Earl of <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> &s;tudied to po&s;&s;e&s;s the Earl of <HI>Albemarle;</HI> And the unea&s;ine&s;s the King was in, di&s;po&s;ed him to think, that if he &s;hould bring in a &s;et of Tories, into his bu&s;ine&s;s, they would &s;erve him with the &s;ame zeal, and with better &s;ucce&s;s, than the Whigs had done; and he hoped to throw all upon the Mini&s;ters, that were now to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="263">
The fir&s;t time that the Lord <HI>Somers</HI> had recovered &s;o much health, as to come to Court, the King told him, it &s;eemed ne|ce&s;&s;ary for his &s;ervice, that he &s;hould part with the Seals, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lord <HI>Somers</HI> is turned out.</NOTE> he wi&s;hed, that he would make the delivering them up his own Act: He excu&s;ed him&s;elf in this; all his Friends had pre&s;&s;ed him, not to offer them, &s;ince that &s;eemed to &s;hew fear or guilt; So he begged the King's pardon, if in this he followed their ad|vice; but he told the King that, when&s;oever he &s;hould &s;end a Warrant under his hand, commanding him to deliver them up, he would immediately obey it; The Order was brought by Lord <HI>Jer&s;ey,</HI> and upon it the Seals were &s;ent to the King. Thus the Lord <HI>Somers</HI> was di&s;charged from this great Office, which he had held &s;even years, with a high reputation for capaci|ty, integrity, and diligence: He was in all re&s;pects the great|e&s;t Man I had ever known in that Po&s;t; His being thus re|moved, was much cen&s;ured by all, but tho&s;e who had pro|cured it; Our Princes u&s;ed not to di&s;mi&s;s Mini&s;ters, who &s;erved them well, unle&s;s they were pre&s;&s;ed to it by a Hou&s;e of Com|mons, that refu&s;ed to give money, till they were laid a&s;ide. But here a Mini&s;ter (who was always vindicated by a great Ma|jority in the Hou&s;e of Commons, when he was charged there, and who had &s;erved both with fidelity and &s;ucce&s;s, and was indeed cen&s;ured for nothing &s;o much, as for his being too com|pliant with the King's humour and notions, or at lea&s;t for be|ing too &s;oft or too feeble in repre&s;enting his errors to him) was removed without a &s;hadow of complaint again&s;t him. This was done with &s;o much ha&s;te, that tho&s;e, who had prevailed with the King to do it, had not yet concerted, who &s;hould &s;ucceed him; They thought, that all the great Men of the Law were a&s;piring to that high Po&s;t, &s;o that any one, to whom it &s;hould be offered, would certainly accept of it: But they &s;oon found they were mi&s;taken; for what, by rea&s;on of the in&s;tability of the Court, what by rea&s;on of the ju&s;t apprehen&s;ions men might have, of &s;ucceeding &s;o great a man, both <HI>Holt</HI> and <HI>Trevor,</HI> to whom the Seals were offered, excu&s;ed them&s;elves. It was Term|time, &s;o a vacancy in that Po&s;t put things in &s;ome confu&s;ion. A temporary Commi&s;&s;ion was granted, to the three Chief Judges, to judge in the Court of Chancery; and after a few days, the Seals were given to Sir <HI>Nathan Wright,</HI> in whom there was no|thing equal to the Po&s;t much le&s;s to him, who had lately fil|led it. The King's inclinations &s;eemed now turned to the To|ries, and to a new Parliament: It was for &s;ome time in the dark, who had the Confidence, and gave directions to affairs; we, who looked on, were often di&s;po&s;ed to think, that there
<PB N="243" REF="264">
was no direction at all, but that every thing was left to take its cour&s;e, and that all was given up to hazard.</P>
<P>The King, that he might give &s;ome content to the Nation, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Fleet &s;ent to the Sound.</NOTE> &s;tay'd at <HI>Hampton-Court</HI> till <HI>July,</HI> and then went to <HI>Holland;</HI> But before he went, the Mini&s;ter of <HI>Sweden</HI> pre&s;&s;ed him to make good his engagements with that Crown; <HI>Riga</HI> was now be&s;ieged by the King of <HI>Poland;</HI> The fir&s;t attempt, of carrying the place by &s;urprize, mi&s;carried; Tho&s;e of <HI>Riga</HI> were either over-awed by the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Garri&s;on, that commanded there, or they apprehended, that the change of Ma&s;ters would not change their condition, unle&s;s it were for the wor&s;e; So they made a greater &s;tand, than was expected; and in a Siege of above eight months, very little progre&s;s was made: The firmne&s;s of that place, made the re&s;t of <HI>Livonia</HI> continue fixt to the <HI>Swedes;</HI> The <HI>Saxons</HI> made great wa&s;te in the Country, and ruined the Trade of <HI>Riga:</HI> The King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> being obliged to imploy his main Force el&s;ewhere, was not able to &s;end them any con&s;i|derable a&s;&s;i&s;tance: The Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> lay quiet, with|out making any attempt: So did the Princes of <HI>He&s;&s;e</HI> and <HI>Wol|fembuttle;</HI> The two &s;cenes of Action were in <HI>Hol&s;tein,</HI> and be|fore <HI>Copenhagen.</HI> The King of <HI>Denmark</HI> found the taking the Forts, that had been rai&s;ed by the Duke of <HI>Hol&s;tein,</HI> an ea&s;y work; they were &s;oon carried and demoli&s;hed; He be&s;ieged <HI>Toninghen</HI> next, which held him longer. Upon the <HI>Swedes</HI> de|mand of the Auxiliary Fleets, that were &s;tipulated, both by the King and the States, Orders were given for equipping them here, and likewi&s;e in <HI>Holland;</HI> The King was not willing to communicate this de&s;ign to the two Hou&s;es, and try if the Hou&s;e of Commons would take upon them&s;elves the Expence of the Fleet; They were in &s;o bad a humour, that the King appre|hended, that &s;ome of them might endeavour to put an affront upon him, and oppo&s;e the &s;ending a Fleet into the Sound: Tho' others advi&s;ed the venturing on this, for no Nation can &s;ub&s;i&s;t without Alliances &s;acredly ob&s;erved; And this was an ancient one, lately renewed by the King; &s;o that an oppo&s;ition in &s;uch a point, mu&s;t have turned to the prejudice of tho&s;e who &s;hould move it. Soon after the Se&s;&s;ion, a Fleet of thirty Ships <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> was &s;ent to the <HI>Baltick,</HI> commanded by <HI>Rook;</HI> The <HI>Danes</HI> had a good Fleet at Sea, much &s;uperior to the <HI>Swedes,</HI> and almo&s;t equal to the Fleet &s;ent from hence; But it was their whole &s;trength, &s;o they would not run the hazard of lo&s;ing it; They kept at Sea for &s;ome time, having got between the <HI>Swedes</HI> and the Fleet of their Allies, and &s;tudied to hinder their conjunction; When they &s;aw that could not be done, they re|tired,
<PB N="244" REF="265">
and &s;ecured them&s;elves within the Port of <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> which is a very &s;trong one: The <HI>Swedes,</HI> with their Allies, came before that Town and bombarded it for &s;ome days, but with little damage to the Place, and none to the Fleet. The Dukes of <HI>Lunenburgh,</HI> together with the Forces, that the <HI>Swedes</HI> had at <HI>Bremen,</HI> pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Elbe,</HI> and marched to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Duke of <HI>Hol&s;tein:</HI> This obliged the <HI>Danes,</HI> to rai&s;e the Siege of <HI>Toninghen,</HI> and the two Armies lay in view of one another, for &s;ome weeks, without coming to any Action: Ano|ther de&s;ign of the <HI>Danes</HI> did al&s;o mi&s;carry. A Body of <HI>Saxons</HI> broke into the Territories of the Duke of <HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> in hopes to force their Army to come back, to the defence of their own Country: But the Duke of <HI>Zell</HI> had left things in &s;o good order, that the <HI>Saxons</HI> were beat back, and all the booty that they had taken, was recovered.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the King offered his Mediation, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace be|tween <HI>Den|mark</HI> and <HI>Sweden.</HI></NOTE> a Treaty was &s;et on foot: The two young Kings were &s;o much &s;harpned again&s;t one another, that it was not ea&s;y to bring them, to hearken to terms of Peace. The King of <HI>Denmark</HI> propo&s;ed, that the King of <HI>Poland</HI> might be included in the Treaty, but the <HI>Swedes</HI> refu&s;ed it: And the King was not Guarantee of the Treaties between <HI>Sweden</HI> and <HI>Poland,</HI> &s;o he was not obliged to take care of the King of <HI>Poland:</HI> The Treaty went on but &s;lowly, this made the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> ap|prehend, that he &s;hould lo&s;e the Sea&s;on, and be forced to aban|don <HI>Riga,</HI> which began to be &s;traitned: So, to quicken the Treaty, he re&s;olved on a De&s;cent in <HI>Zealand.</HI> This was execut|ed, without any oppo&s;ition, the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> conducting it in per&s;on, and being the fir&s;t that landed: He &s;hewed &s;uch &s;pirit and courage in his whole Conduct, as rai&s;ed his Character very high: It &s;truck a terror thro' all <HI>Denmark:</HI> For now the <HI>Swedes</HI> re&s;olved to be&s;iege <HI>Copenhagen.</HI> This did &s;o quicken the Treaty, that by the middle of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> it was brought to a full end: old Treaties were renewed, and a liberty of fortifying was re&s;erved for <HI>Hol&s;tein,</HI> under &s;ome limitations: and the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> pay'd the Duke of <HI>Hol&s;tein</HI> two hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and rix-dollars for the charge of the War. The Peace being thus made, the <HI>Swedes</HI> retired back to <HI>Schonen:</HI> and the Fleets of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> returned home. The King's Conduct, in this whole matter, was highly applauded; he ef|fectually protected the <HI>Swedes,</HI> and yet obliged them to accept of rea&s;onable terms of Peace: The King of <HI>Denmark</HI> &s;uffered mo&s;t in honour and intere&s;t: It was a great happine&s;s, that this War was &s;o &s;oon at an end; for if it had continued, all the

North mu&s;t have engaged in it, and there the chief &s;trength of the Prote&s;tant Religion lay: &s;o that Intere&s;t mu&s;t have &s;uf|fered much, which &s;ide &s;oever had come by the wor&s;t, in the progre&s;s of the War: and it is already &s;o weak, that it needed not a new diminution.</P>
<P>The &s;ecret of the Partition Treaty was now publi&s;hed; and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cen&s;ure$ pa&s;t on the Partition Treaty.</NOTE> the Project was to be offered jointly, by the Mini&s;ters of <HI>France, England</HI> and the <HI>States,</HI> to all the Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> but par|ticularly to tho&s;e, who were mo&s;t concerned in it; and an An|&s;wer was to be demanded, by a day limited for it. The Empe|ror refu&s;ed to declare him&s;elf, till he knew the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s mind concerning it: The Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> and the Princes of <HI>Italy,</HI> were very apprehen&s;ive of the neighbourhood of <HI>France:</HI> The Pope was extreme old, and declined very fa&s;t. The Treaty was variou&s;ly cen&s;ured: Some thought it would deliver up the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea, and all our Trade there, into the hands of <HI>France:</HI> Others thought, that the Treaties of Princes were (according to the pattern, that the Court of <HI>France</HI> had &s;et now for almo&s;t half an age) only artifices to bring matters to a pre|&s;ent quiet, and that they would be afterwards ob&s;erved, as Prin|ces found their account in them. The pre&s;ent good under|&s;tanding, that was between our Court and the Court of <HI>France,</HI> made, that the Party of our Malecontents at home, having no &s;upport from thence, &s;unk much in their heat, and they had now no pro&s;pect; for it &s;eemed, as if the King of <HI>France</HI> had &s;et his heart on the Partition Treaty, and it was nece&s;&s;ary for him, in order to the obtaining his ends in it, to live in a good Corre&s;pondence with <HI>England</HI> and the <HI>States:</HI> All our hopes were, that the King of <HI>Spain</HI> might yet live a few years longer, till the great Mortgages, that were on the Revenue, might be cleared, and then it would be more ea&s;y for us, to engage in a new War, and to be the Arbiters of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>But while we were under the apprehen&s;ion of his death, we <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Death of the Duke of <HI>Gloce&s;ter.</HI></NOTE> were &s;urprized by an unlooked for and &s;udden death of our young Prince at home, which brought a great change on the face of affairs. I had been tru&s;ted with his education now for two years; and he had made an amazing progre&s;s; I had read over the <HI>P&s;alms, Proverbs,</HI> and <HI>Go&s;pels</HI> with him, and had explained things, that fell in my way, very copiou&s;ly; and was often &s;urprized, with the Que&s;tions that he put me, and the Reflections that he made; he came to under&s;tand things, relat|ing to Religion, beyond imagination; I went thro' Geography &s;o often with him, that he knew all the Maps very particular|ly; I explained to him the forms of Government in every Coun|try,
<PB N="246" REF="267">
with the Intere&s;ts and Trade of that Country, and what was both good and bad in it: I acquainted him, with all the great Revolutions, that had been in the world, and gave him a copious account of the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Hi&s;tories, and of <HI>Plutarch</HI>'s Lives; The la&s;t thing I explained to him was the <HI>Gothick</HI> Con&s;titution, and the Beneficiary and Feudal Laws: I talked of the&s;e things at different times, near three hours a day: This was both ea&s;y and delighting to him. The King ordered five of his chief Mini&s;ters, to come once a quar|ter, and examine the progre&s;s he made: They &s;eemed amazed both at his knowledge, and the good under&s;tanding that appear|ed in him: He had a wonderful memory, and a very good judge|ment. He had gone thro' much weakne&s;s, and &s;ome years of ill health: The Prince&s;s was with Child of him, during all the Di&s;order we were in at the Revolution, tho' &s;he did not know it her&s;elf at the time, when &s;he left the Court: This probably had given him &s;o weak a Con&s;titution, but we hoped the dan|gerous time was over: His Birth-day was the <HI>24th</HI> of <HI>July,</HI> and he was then eleven years old: He complained a little the next day, but we imputed that to the fatigues of a Birth-day; So that he was too much neglected; The day after, he grew much wor&s;e, and it proved to be a Malignant Fever; He died the fourth day of his illne&s;s, to the great grief of all who were con|cerned in him. He was the only remaining Child, of &s;eventeen that the Prince&s;s had born, &s;ome to the full time and the re&s;t before it. She attended on him, during his &s;ickne&s;s, with great tenderne&s;s, but with a grave compo&s;edne&s;s, that amazed all who &s;aw it: She bore his death with a Re&s;ignation and Piety that were indeed very &s;ingular. His death gave a great alarm to the whole Nation: The Jacobites grew in&s;olent upon it and &s;aid, now the chief difficulty was removed out of the way of the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI>'s Succe&s;&s;ion. Soon after this, the Hou&s;e of <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> returned the Vi&s;it, that the King had made them la&s;t year, and the eyes of all the Prote&s;tants in the Nation turn|ed towards the Electore&s;s of <HI>Brun&s;wick;</HI> who was Daughter to the Queen of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and was the next Prote&s;tant Heir, all Papi&s;ts being already excluded from the Succe&s;&s;ion. Thus, of the four Lives that we had in view, as our chief &s;ecurity, the two that we depended mo&s;t on, the Queen and the Duke of <HI>Gloce&s;ter</HI> were carried off on the &s;udden, before we were aware of it, and of the two that remain'd (the King and the Prin|ce&s;s) as there was no i&s;&s;ue, and little hopes of any by either of them, &s;o the King, who at be&s;t was a man of a feeble Con|&s;titution, was now falling under an ill habit of body: His Legs

were much &s;welled, which &s;ome thought was the beginning of a Drop&s;y, while others thought it was only a &s;corbutick Di&s;|temper.</P>
<P>Thus God was giving us great alarms, as well as many mer|cies: <NOTE PLACE="marg">The temper of the Na|tion.</NOTE> He bears long with us, but we are become very corrupt in all re&s;pects; So that the &s;tate of things among us gives a melancholy pro&s;pect. The Nation was falling under a general di&s;content, and a di&s;like of the King's per&s;on and government; And the King, on his part, &s;eemed to grow weary of us and of our affairs; and partly by the fret, from the oppo&s;ition he had of late met with, partly from his ill health, he was falling as it were into a lethargy of mind; We were, upon the mat|ter, become already more than half a Commonwealth; &s;ince the Government was plainly in the hands of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, who mu&s;t &s;it once a year, and as long as they thought fit, while the King had only the Civil Li&s;t for Life, &s;o that the whole Admini&s;tration of the Government was under their in&s;pection: The Act for Triennial Parliaments kept up a &s;tand|ing faction in every County and Town of <HI>England:</HI> But tho' we were falling in&s;en&s;ibly into a Democracy, we had not learn|ed the virtues, that are nece&s;&s;ary for that &s;ort of Government; Luxury, Vanity, and Ambition increa&s;ed daily, and our animo&s;ities were come to a great height, and gave us di&s;mal apprehen&s;ions. Few among us &s;eem'd to have a right notion of the love of their Country, and of a zeal for the good of the Publick: The Hou&s;e of Commons, how much &s;oever its power was advanced, yet was much &s;unk in its credit; very little of gravity, order, or common decency appeared among them: The balance lay chiefly in the Hou&s;e of Lords, who had no natural &s;trength to re&s;i&s;t the Commons: The Toleration, of all the &s;ects among us, had made us live more quietly together of late, than could be expected, when &s;evere Laws were rigorou&s;ly executed again&s;t Di&s;&s;enters. No tumults or di&s;orders had been heard of in any part of the Kingdom, the&s;e eleven years, &s;ince that Act pa&s;&s;ed: and yet the much greater part of the Clergy &s;tudied to blow up this fire again, which &s;eemed to be now, as it were covered over with a&s;hes.</P>
<P>The Di&s;&s;enters behaved them&s;elves more quietly, with relation <NOTE PLACE="marg">Divi&s;ions among the Di&s;&s;enters.</NOTE> to the Church, they having quarrels and di&s;putes among them|&s;elves: The Independents were rai&s;ing the old <HI>Antinomian</HI> Te|nets, as if men, by believing in Chri&s;t, were &s;o united to him, that his righteou&s;ne&s;s became theirs, without any other condi|tion, be&s;ides that of their Faith: So that, tho' they acknow|ledged the obedience of his Laws to be nece&s;&s;ary, they did not
<PB N="248" REF="269">
call it a condition, but only a con&s;equence of ju&s;tification. In this, they were oppo&s;ed by mo&s;t of the Presbyterians, who &s;eemed to be &s;en&s;ible, that this &s;truck at the root of all Religion, as it weaken'd the obligation to a holy life: This year had pro|duced a new extravagance in that matter. One <HI>A&s;gil,</HI> a Member of Parliament, had publi&s;hed a Book, grounded on their notions, on which he had grafted a new and wild inference of his own, that &s;ince true Believers recover'd in Chri&s;t all that they lo&s;t in <HI>Adam,</HI> and our natural death was the effect of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Sin, he inferr'd that Believers were render'd immortal by Chri&s;t, and not liable to death: And that tho&s;e who believed, with a true and firm Faith, could not die. This was a &s;train beyond all that ever went before it, and &s;ince we &s;ee that all men die, the natural con&s;equence that re&s;ulted from this was, that there neither are nor ever were any true Believers. The Presbyte|rians had been al&s;o engaged in di&s;putes with the Anabapti&s;ts. They complain'd, that they &s;aw too great a giddine&s;s in their people, and &s;eemed &s;o &s;en&s;ible of this, and &s;o de&s;irous to be brought into the Church, that a few incon&s;iderable Conce&s;&s;ions would very probably have brought the bulk of them into our Communion: But the greater part of the Clergy were &s;o far from any di&s;po&s;ition this way, that they &s;eem to be more preju|diced again&s;t them than ever.</P>
<P>The Quakers have had a great breach made among them, <NOTE PLACE="marg">And among the Quakers.</NOTE> by one <HI>George Keith,</HI> a <HI>Scotchman,</HI> with whom I had my fir&s;t education at <HI>Aberdeen;</HI> He had been thirty &s;ix years among them; He was e&s;teemed the mo&s;t learned man, that ever was in that &s;ect; He was well ver&s;ed both in the Oriental Tongues, in Philo&s;ophy and Mathematicks; After he had been above thirty years in high e&s;teem among them; He was &s;ent to <HI>Pen|&s;ilvania</HI> (a Colony &s;et up by <HI>Pen,</HI> where they are very nume|rous) to have the chief direction of the education of their youth. In tho&s;e parts, he &s;aid, he fir&s;t di&s;covered that, which had been always either denied to him, or &s;o di&s;gui&s;ed that he did not &s;u&s;pect it; But being far out of reach, and in a place where they were Ma&s;ters, they &s;poke out their mind plainer; and it ap|peared to him, that they were Dei&s;ts, and that they turned the whole Doctrine of the Chri&s;tian Religion into Allegories; chief|ly tho&s;e, which relate to the Death and Re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t, and the reconciliation of Sinners to God, by virtue of his Cro&s;s: He being a true Chri&s;tian, &s;et him&s;elf with great zeal again&s;t this, upon which they grew weary of him, and &s;ent him back to <HI>England.</HI> At his return, he &s;et him&s;elf to read many of their Books, and then he di&s;covered the My&s;tery, which was formerly &s;o hid from him, that he had not ob&s;erved it: Upon
<PB N="249" REF="270">
this, he opened a new meeting, and by a printed Summons he called the whole Party, to come and &s;ee the Proof, that he had to offer, to convince them of the&s;e errors: Few Quakers came to his Meetings, but great multitudes of other People flockt about him: He brought the Quakers Books with him, and read &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages out of them, as convinced his hearers, that he had not charged them fal&s;ly: He continued the&s;e Meetings, being &s;till in outward appearance a Quaker, for &s;ome years; till hav|ing prevailed, as far as he &s;aw any probability of &s;ucce&s;s, he laid a&s;ide their exterior, and was reconciled to the Church, and is now in Holy Orders among us, and likely to do good &s;ervice, in undeceiving and reclaiming &s;ome of tho&s;e mi&s;led Enthu&s;ia&s;ts.</P>
<P>The Clergy continued to be much divided: All mode|rate <NOTE PLACE="marg">A divi&s;ion in the Church.</NOTE> Divines were looked upon by &s;ome hot men, with an ill eye, as per&s;ons who were cold and indifferent in the mat|ters of the Church: That which flowed from a gentlene&s;s, both of temper and principle, was repre&s;ented, as an incli|nation to favour Di&s;&s;enters, which pa&s;&s;ed among many, for a more heinous thing than leaning to Popery it&s;elf. Tho&s;e men, who began now to be called the <HI>High Church</HI> Party, had all along expre&s;&s;ed a coldne&s;s, if not an oppo&s;ition to the pre&s;ent Settlement; Soon after the Revolution, &s;ome great Pre|ferments had been given among them, to try if it was po&s;&s;i|ble to bring them, to be hearty for the Government; but it appearing, that they were &s;oured with a leaven, that had gone too deep to be wrought out, a &s;top was put to the courting them any more; When they &s;aw Preferments went in another Chan|nel, they &s;et up a complaint over <HI>England</HI> of the want of Con|vocations, they that were not allowed to &s;it nor act with a free liberty, to con&s;ider of the grievances of the Clergy, and of the danger the Church was in. This was a new preten&s;ion, never thought of &s;ince the Reformation; Some Books were writ to ju&s;tify it, with great acrimony of &s;tile, and a &s;train of in|&s;olence, that was peculiar to one <HI>Atterbury,</HI> who had indeed very good parts, great learning, and was an excellent Preacher, and had many extraordinary things in him; but was both am|bitious and virulent out of mea&s;ure; And had a &s;ingular ta|lent in a&s;&s;erting Paradoxes with a great air of a&s;&s;urance, &s;hewing no &s;hame when he was detected in them, tho' this was done in many in&s;tances: But he let all $$e&s;e pa&s;s, without either con|&s;e&s;&s;ing his errors, or pretending to ju&s;tify him&s;elf: he went on &s;till venting new fal&s;hoods in &s;o barefaced a manner, that he &s;eemed to have outdone the Je&s;uits them&s;elves. He thought
<PB N="250" REF="271">
the Government had &s;o little &s;trength or credit, that any claim again&s;t it would be well received; he attack'd the Supremacy of the Crown, with relation to Eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters, which had been hitherto maintained by all our Divines with great zeal; But now the hot men of the Clergy did &s;o readily entertain his Notions, that in them it appeared, that tho&s;e who are the mo&s;t earne&s;t in the defence of certain points, when the&s;e &s;eem to be for them, can very nimbly change their minds upon a change of circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>An eminent in&s;tance of this had appeared in the Hou&s;e of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Debates con|cerning the Bi&s;hop of St. <HI>David's.</HI></NOTE> Lords, in the former Se&s;&s;ion; Where the deprived Bi&s;hop of St. <HI>David</HI>'s complained of the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury;</HI> Fir&s;t, For breach of Privilege, &s;ince Sentence was pa&s;t upon him, tho' he had in Court claimed Privilege of Parliament, to which no regard had been paid: But as he had waved his Privilege in the Hou&s;e of Lords, it was carried, after a long Debate and by no great Majority, that in that ca&s;e, he could not re|&s;ume his Privilege. He excepted next to the Archbi&s;hop's Juri&s;|diction, and pretended that he could not judge a Bi&s;hop, but in a Synod of the Bi&s;hops of the Province, according to the Rules of the Primitive Times: In oppo&s;ition to this it was &s;hewn, that from the ninth and tenth Century downward, both Popes and Kings had concurred to bring this Power &s;ingly in|to the hands of the Metropolitans; That this was the con&s;tant practice in <HI>England</HI> before the Reformation; that by the pro|vi&s;ional Clau&s;e, in the Act pa&s;t in the twenty fifth of <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, that empowered thirty two per&s;ons to draw a new Body of Church Laws, all former Laws or Cu&s;toms were to continue in force, till that new Body was prepared: So that the Power, the Metropolitan then was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, &s;tood confirmed by that Clau&s;e: It is true, during the High Commi&s;&s;ion, all Proceedings again&s;t Bi&s;hops were brought before that Court, which proceeded in a Summary way, and again&s;t who&s;e Sen|tence no Appeal lay; But after that Court was taken away, a full Declaration was made, by an Act of Parliament, for conti|nuing the Power that was lodged with the Metropolitan. It was al&s;o urged, that if the Bi&s;hop had any exception to the Arch|bi&s;hop's Juri&s;diction, that ought to have been pleaded in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and not re&s;erved to the conclu&s;ion of all: Nor could the Archbi&s;hop erect a new Court, or proceed in the Trial of a Bi&s;hop in any other way, than in that, which was warranted by Law or Precedent. To all this no an&s;wer was made, but the bu&s;ine&s;s was kept up, and put off by many de|lays; It was &s;aid, the thing was new, and the Hou&s;e was not
<PB N="251" REF="272">
yet well apprized of it; and the la&s;t time, in which the Debate was taken up in the Hou&s;e, it ended in an intimation, that it was hoped the King would not fill that See, till the Hou&s;e &s;hould be better &s;atisfied, in the point of the Archbi&s;hop's Authority: So the Bi&s;hoprick was not di&s;po&s;ed of for &s;ome years: And this un|certainty put a great delay to the Proce&s;s again&s;t the other <HI>Welch</HI> Bi&s;hop, accu&s;ed of the &s;ame Crime.</P>
<P>In <HI>October</HI> the Pope died; and at the &s;ame time, all <HI>Europe</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The death of the King of <HI>Spain.</HI></NOTE> was alarmed with the de&s;perate &s;tate of the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s health; when the news came to the Court of <HI>France,</HI> that he was in the la&s;t Agony, the Earl of <HI>Manche&s;ter,</HI> who was then our Amba&s;&s;ador in that Court, told me, that Mr. <HI>Tor|cy,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Secretary of State, was &s;ent to him by the King of <HI>France,</HI> de&s;iring him to let the King his Ma&s;ter know the News, and to &s;ignify to him, that the <HI>French</HI> King hoped, that he would put things in a readine&s;s, to execute the Treaty, in ca&s;e any oppo&s;ition &s;hould be made to it; And in his whole di&s;cour&s;e, he expre&s;&s;ed a fixed Re&s;olution in the <HI>French</HI> Councils to adhere to it: A few days after that, the news came of his Death and of his Will, declaring the Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI> the Uni|ver&s;al Heir of the whole <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy: It is not yet cer|tainly known, by what means this was brought about, nor how the King of <HI>Spain</HI> was drawn to con&s;ent to it, or whether it was a meer forgery, made by Cardinal <HI>Portocarrero</HI> and &s;ome of the Grandees, who partly by practice and corruption, and partly for &s;afety and that their Monarchy might be kept entire (they imagining that the Power of <HI>France</HI> was far &s;uperior to all, that the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> would be able to engage in its intere&s;ts) had been prevailed on to prepare and publi&s;h this Will; and, to make it more acceptable to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> among other For|feitures of the Crown, not only the Succe&s;&s;or's departing from, what they call the Catholick Faith, but even his not maintain|ing the immaculate Conception of the Virgin, was One.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the news came to <HI>Rome,</HI> it quickned the Intrigues <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Clement</HI> the Eleventh cho&s;en Pope.</NOTE> of the Conclave, &s;o they &s;et up <HI>Albano,</HI> a man of fifty two years of age, who beyond all mens expectation was cho&s;en Pope, and took the name of <HI>Clement</HI> the Eleventh: He had little practice in affairs, but was very learned; And in &s;o critical a time, it &s;eems, a Pope of Courage and Spirit, not &s;unk with age into covetou&s;ne&s;s or peevi&s;hne&s;s, was thought the fitte&s;t Per|&s;on for that See. <HI>France</HI> had &s;ent no exclu&s;ion to bar him, not imagining that he could be thought on: At fir&s;t they did not &s;eem plea&s;ed with the choice, but it was too late to oppo&s;e it: So they re&s;olved to gain him to their intere&s;ts, in which
<PB N="252" REF="273">
they have &s;ucceeded beyond what they then hoped for. When the Court of <HI>France</HI> had notice &s;ent them of the late King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Will, real or pretended, they &s;eemed to be at a &s;tand for &s;ome days; And the Letters wrote from the Secretary's Of|fice, gave it out for certain, that the King would &s;tick to the Partition Treaty: Madam <HI>de Maintenon</HI> had an un&s;peakable fondne&s;s for the Duke of <HI>Anjou;</HI> So &s;he prevailed with the <HI>Dauphin</HI> to accept of the Will, and &s;et a&s;ide the Treaty; She al&s;o engaged <HI>Pontchartrain</HI> to &s;econd this.</P>
<P>They being thus prepared; when the news of the King of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Wi$$ is ac|cepted.</NOTE> <HI>Spain</HI>'s Death came to <HI>Fontainebleau,</HI> where the Court was at that time; Mr. <HI>Spanheim,</HI> who was then there as Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> told me, that a Cabinet Council was called, within two hours after the news came; It met in Madam <HI>de Mainte|non</HI>'s Lodgings, and &s;ate about four hours: <HI>Pontchartrain</HI> was for accepting the Will, and the re&s;t of the Mini&s;try were for adhering to the Treaty; But the <HI>Dauphin</HI> joined, for accepting the Will, with an air of po&s;itivene&s;s, that he had never a&s;&s;um|ed before; So it was believed to be done by concert with the King, who was re&s;erved and &s;eemed more enclined to the Trea|ty: In conclu&s;ion, Madam <HI>Maintenon</HI> &s;aid, what had the Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI> done, to provoke the King, to barr him of his Right to that Succe&s;&s;ion? And upon this, all &s;ubmitted to the <HI>Dau|phin</HI>'s opinion, and the King &s;eemed overcome with their rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>This was on <HI>Munday;</HI> But tho' the matter was re&s;olved on, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI> de|clared King of <HI>Spain.</HI></NOTE> yet it was not publi&s;hed till <HI>Thur&s;day;</HI> For then, at the King's Levee, he declared, that he accepted of the Will, and the Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI> was now treated as King of <HI>Spain.</HI> Notice of this being &s;ent to <HI>Spain,</HI> an Amba&s;&s;ador came in form, to &s;ignify the Will, and to de&s;ire that their King might go and live among them; Upon which he was &s;ent thither, accompanied by his two Brothers, who went with him to the Frontiers of <HI>Spain.</HI> When the Court of <HI>France</HI> publi&s;hed this Re&s;olution, and &s;ent it to all the Courts of <HI>Europe,</HI> they added a mo&s;t infamous excu&s;e, for this notorious breach of Faith: They &s;aid, the King of <HI>France</HI> con&s;idered chiefly what was the main de&s;ign of the $span$ty, which was to maintain the Peace of <HI>Europe;</HI> and there|fore to pur&s;ue this, he departed from the words of the Treaty, $span$e adhered to the Spirit and the chief intent of it. This $word$ to be an equivocation of &s;o gro&s;s a nature, that it look|ed like the invention of a Je&s;uit Confe&s;&s;or, adding impudence to Perjury. The King and the <HI>States</HI> were &s;truck with this: The King was full of indignation, to find him&s;elf &s;o much abu&s;ed; So he came over to <HI>England,</HI> to &s;ee what was to be
<PB N="253" REF="274">
done upon &s;o great an emergency. The <HI>Spaniards,</HI> &s;eeing them|&s;elves threaten'd with a War from the Emperor, and apprehend|ing that the Empire, together with <HI>England</HI> and the United Provinces, might be engaged to join in the War, and being unable to defend them&s;elves, delivered all into the hands of <HI>France;</HI> And upon that, both the <HI>Spani&s;h Netherlands</HI> and the Dutchy of <HI>Milan</HI> received <HI>French</HI> Garri&s;ons: The <HI>French</HI> Fleet came to <HI>Cadiz;</HI> A Squadron was al&s;o &s;ent to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies;</HI> So that the whole <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Empire fell now, without a &s;troke of the Sword, into the <HI>French</HI> Power. All this was the more formidable, becau&s;e the Duke of <HI>Burgundy</HI> had then no Children, and by this means, the King of <HI>Spain</HI> was in time likely to &s;ucceed to the Crown of <HI>France;</HI> And thus the World &s;aw the appearance of a new Univer&s;al Monarchy, like to ari&s;e out of this conjunction.</P>
<P>It might have been expected that, when &s;uch a new unlook|ed <NOTE PLACE="marg">A new Par|liament &s;ummoned.</NOTE> for Scene was opened, the King &s;hould have lo&s;t no time in bringing his Parliament together, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; It was prorogued to the <HI>20th</HI> of <HI>November,</HI> and the King had &s;ent Orders from <HI>Holland,</HI> to &s;ignify his Re&s;olution for their Meeting on that day; But the Mini&s;ters, whom he was then bringing into his bu&s;ine&s;s, had other views: They thought they were not &s;ure of a Majority in Parliament for their purpo&s;es, &s;o they prevailed with the King to di&s;&s;olve the Parliament, and after a &s;et of Sheriffs were pricked, fit for the turn, a new Par|liament was &s;ummoned, to meet on the &s;ixth day of <HI>February,</HI> but it was not opened till the tenth.</P>
<P>And now I am come to the end of this Century, in which <NOTE PLACE="marg">The end of the Century.</NOTE> there was a black appearance of a new and di&s;mal &s;cene; <HI>France</HI> was now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a great Empire, for a &s;mall part of which they had been in Wars (broke off indeed in &s;ome intervals) for above two hundred years; while we in <HI>England,</HI> who were to protect and defend the re&s;t, were, by wretched factions and violent animo&s;ities, running into a feeble and di&s;|jointed &s;tate; The King's cold and re&s;erved manner, upon &s;o high a provocation, made &s;ome conclude, that he was in &s;ecret engagements with <HI>France;</HI> that he was re&s;olved to own the new King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and not to engage in a new War: This &s;eemed &s;o different from his own inclinations, and from all the former parts of his Life, that it made many conclude, that he found him&s;elf in an ill &s;tate of health, the &s;welling of his Legs being much encrea&s;ed, and that this might have &s;uch effects on his mind, as to make him le&s;s warm and active, le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to involve him&s;elf in new troubles; and that he might think
<PB N="254" REF="275">
it too incon&s;iderate a thing to enter on a new War, that was not like to end &s;oon, when he felt him&s;elf in a declining &s;tate of health: But the true &s;ecret, of this unaccountable behaviour in the King, was &s;oon di&s;covered.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> was now &s;et at the head of his bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and was to bring the Tories into his Service: They had <NOTE PLACE="marg">A new Mi|ni&s;try.</NOTE> continued, from his fir&s;t acce&s;&s;ion to the Throne, in a con|&s;tant oppo&s;ition to his intere&s;ts; Many of them were believed to be Jacobites in their hearts, and they were generally much again&s;t the Toleration, and violent enemies to the Di&s;&s;enters: They had been backward in every thing, that was nece&s;&s;ary for carrying on the former War; they had oppo&s;ed Taxes as much as they could, and were again&s;t all &s;uch, as were ea&s;ily levied and le&s;s &s;en&s;ibly felt by the people; and were always for tho&s;e, that were mo&s;t grievous to the Nation, hoping that by tho&s;e heavy burthens, the people would grow weary of the War and of the Go|vernment; On the contrary the Whigs, by &s;upporting both, were become le&s;s acceptable to the Nation: In Elections their Intere&s;t was much &s;unk; every new Parliament was a new di&s;covery, that they were become le&s;s popular, and the others, who were always oppo&s;ing and complaining, were now cried up as the Patriots. In the three la&s;t Se&s;&s;ions, the Whigs had &s;hewed &s;uch a readine&s;s to give the King more force, together with a management to pre&s;erve the Grants of <HI>Ireland,</HI> that they were publickly charged as Betrayers of their Country, and as men that were for tru&s;ting the King with an Army; in a word, they were accu&s;ed of too ready a compliance with the humours and intere&s;ts of Courts and Favourites, &s;o they were generally cen&s;ured and decried: And now &s;ince they had not &s;ucceeded to the King's mind, &s;ome about him po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him with this, that either they would not, or could not &s;erve him. In &s;ome of them indeed, their Principles lay again&s;t tho&s;e things, whereas the Tories Principles did naturally lead them to make the Crown great and powerful: It was al&s;o &s;aid, that the great oppo&s;ition made, to every thing the King de&s;ired, and the difficulties that had been of late put upon him, flowed chiefly from the hatred born to tho&s;e, who were imployed by him, and who had brought in their friends and creatures into the be&s;t Po&s;ts; And they were now &s;tudying, to recover their lo&s;t popularity; which would make them cold, if not backward in complying with who, the King might de&s;ire for the future; The Whigs did al&s;o began to complain of the King's Conduct, of his minding Af|fairs &s;o $word$, of his being &s;o much out of the Kingdom, and of his ill choice of Favourites; and they imputed the late
<PB N="255" REF="276">
mi&s;carriages to errors in conduct, which they could neither pre|vent nor redre&s;s: The Favourites, who thought of nothing but to continue in favour, and to be &s;till &s;afe and &s;ecure in their credit, concurred to pre&s;s the King to take other mea&s;ures, and to turn to another &s;et of men, who would be no longer his enemies, if they had &s;ome of the be&s;t Places &s;hared among them: And tho' this method had been almo&s;t fatal, when the King had followed it, &s;oon after his fir&s;t Acce&s;&s;ion to the Crown, yet there &s;eemed to be le&s;s danger in trying it now, than was formerly. We were in full Peace: And it was commonly &s;aid, that no body thought any more of King <HI>James,</HI> and therefore it was fit, for the King's Service, to encourage all his people to come into his intere&s;ts, by letting them &s;ee how &s;oon he could forget all that was pa&s;t. The&s;e con&s;iderations had &s;o far prevailed with him, that before he went out of <HI>England,</HI> he had engaged him&s;elf &s;ecretly to them: It is true, the Death, fir&s;t of the Duke of <HI>Gloce&s;ter,</HI> and now of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> had very much changed the face of affairs, both at home and abroad; yet the King would not break off from his engage|ments.</P>
<P>Soon after his return to <HI>England,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> was declared Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and he had the chief di|rection of affairs; And, that the mo&s;t eminent man of the Whigs might not oppo&s;e them in the new Parliament, they got Mr. <HI>Mountague</HI> to be made a Baron, who took the Title of <HI>Halifax,</HI> which was &s;unk by the death of that Marqui&s;s, with|out i&s;&s;ue Male. The man, on who&s;e management of the Hou&s;e of Commons, this new Set depended, was Mr. <HI>Harley,</HI> the Heir of a Family, which had been hitherto the mo&s;t eminent of the Presbyterian Party; his Education was in that way: But he, not being con&s;idered at the Revolution, as he thought he de&s;erved, had &s;et him&s;elf to oppo&s;e the Court in every thing, and to find fault with the whole Admini&s;tration; he had the chief hand, both in the reduction of the Army, and in the matter of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Grants; The High Party tru&s;ted him, tho' he &s;till kept up an intere&s;t among the Presbyterians; and he had &s;o particular a dexterity, that he made both the High Church Party and the Di&s;&s;enters depend upon him; &s;o it was agreed that he &s;hould be Speaker. All this while, the new Mini&s;ters talked of nothing but Negotiations, and gave it out, that the King of <HI>France</HI> was ready to give all the &s;ecurity that could be de&s;ired, for maintaining the Peace of <HI>Europe.</HI> At this time, the Emperor &s;ent over to <HI>England</HI> a Mini&s;ter, to &s;et forth his Title to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy, &s;ettled on his
<PB N="256" REF="277">
Hou&s;e by antient Entails, often repeated, and now devolving on him by an undoubted Right, &s;ince by the Renunciation made by the late Queen of <HI>France,</HI> (as was &s;tipulated by the Treaty of the <HI>Pyrenees,</HI> and then made by her in due form) this could not be called in que&s;tion. Our new Mini&s;ters were &s;carce civil to the Emperor's Envoy; and would not enter into any Con|&s;ultations with him: But the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who were about the King, and all the Foreign Mini&s;ters &s;poke in another Stile; they &s;aid, that nothing but a General Union of all the Powers in <HI>Europe,</HI> could hinder the conjunction of the two Monarchies: So, by what tho&s;e, who talked often with the King, gave out, it came to be &s;oon known, that the King &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of a new War, but that he kept him&s;elf in a great re&s;erve, that he might manage his new Mini&s;ters and their Party, and &s;ee if he could engage them to concur with him.</P>
<P>But before I conclude the relation of this year, at which the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King, of <HI>Sweden</HI>'s glorious Campaign.</NOTE> Century ends, I mu&s;t clo&s;e it with an account of the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>'s glorious Campaign: He made all the ha&s;te he could to relieve <HI>Livonia,</HI> where not only <HI>Riga</HI> was for &s;ome months be&s;ieged by the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> but <HI>Narva</HI> was al&s;o attackt by the <HI>Czar,</HI> who hoped by taking it, to get an entrance into the <HI>Baltick:</HI> The <HI>Czar</HI> came in Per&s;on again&s;t it, with an Ar|my of one hundred thou&s;and men: <HI>Narva</HI> was not provided for a Siege: It had a &s;mall Garri&s;on, and had very poor Ma|gazines, yet the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> attackt it &s;o feebly, that it held out beyond all expectation, till the end of the year. Upon the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>'s landing at <HI>Revel,</HI> the <HI>Saxons</HI> drew off from <HI>Riga,</HI> after a long Siege at a va&s;t charge: This being done, and <HI>Riga</HI> both opened and &s;upplied, that King marched next to <HI>Narva;</HI> The <HI>Czar,</HI> upon his March towards him, left his Army in &s;uch a manner, as made all people conclude, he had no mind to hazard his Per&s;on; The King marched thro' ways, that were thought &s;o impracticable, that little care had been taken to &s;ecure them; So he &s;urpri&s;ed the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> and broke into their Camp, before they apprehended he was near them; he totally routed their Army, took many Pri&s;oners, with all their Artillery and Baggage, and &s;o made a glorious entry into <HI>Nar|va.</HI> This is the noble&s;t Campaign that we find in any Hi&s;to|ry; in which a King about eighteen years of age, led an Army him&s;elf again&s;t three Kings, who had confederated again&s;t him, and was &s;ucce&s;sful in every one of his Attempts, giving great marks, both of per&s;onal courage and good conduct in them all; and which is more extraordinary, an eminent mea&s;ure both of Virtue and Piety appeared in his whole behaviour. In him,
<PB N="257" REF="278">
the World hoped to &s;ee another <HI>Gu&s;tavus Adolphus,</HI> who con|quered, or rather po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of <HI>Livonia,</HI> in the &s;ame year of his age, in which this King did now &s;o gloriou&s;ly re|cover it, when almo&s;t lo&s;t by the Inva&s;ion of two powerful Neighbours. There were great di&s;orders at this time in <HI>Li|thuania,</HI> occa&s;ioned by the Factions there, which were &s;et on and fomented by the King, who &s;eemed to a&s;pire to be the Hereditary King of <HI>Poland.</HI> But as the&s;e things are at a great di&s;tance from us, &s;o &s;ince we have no publick Mini&s;ter in tho&s;e parts, I cannot give an account of them, nor form a true judg|ment thereupon. The Eighteenth Century began with a great Scene, that opened with it.</P>
<P>The new King of <HI>Spain</HI> wrote to all the Courts of <HI>Europe,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1701 Great ap|prehen&s;ions of the dan|ger <HI>Europe</HI> was now in.</NOTE> giving notice of his Acce&s;&s;ion to that Crown, only he forgot <HI>England;</HI> And it was publickly given out, that he had pro|mi&s;ed the pretended Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> that in due time he would take care of his intere&s;ts: The King and the <HI>States</HI> were much alarmed, when they beheld the <HI>French</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the <HI>Spani&s;h Netherlands;</HI> A great part of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Army lay &s;cattered up and down in tho&s;e Garri&s;ons, more particularly in <HI>Luxemburgh, Namur</HI> and <HI>Mons,</HI> and the&s;e were now made Pri&s;oners of War: Neither Officers nor Soldiers could own the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> for their Ma&s;ters had not yet done it: At this time, the <HI>French</HI> pre&s;&s;ed the <HI>States</HI> very hard to declare them|&s;elves: A great Party in the <HI>States</HI> were for owning him, at lea&s;t in form, till they could get their Troops again into their own hands, according to Capitulation: Nor were they then, in a condition to re&s;i&s;t the impre&s;&s;ion, that might have been made upon them, from the Garri&s;ons in the <HI>Spani&s;h Guelder,</HI> who could have attack'd them before they were able to make head; So the <HI>States</HI> con&s;ented to own the King of <HI>Spain.</HI> That being done, their Battalions were &s;ent back, but they were ill u&s;ed, contrary to Capitulation, and the Soldiers were tempt|ed to de&s;ert their Service, yet very few could be prevailed on to do it.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as our Parliament was opened, it appeared that the <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Party for <HI>France</HI> in the Parlia|ment.</NOTE> <HI>French</HI> had a great Party in it; It is certain, great Sums came over this Winter from <HI>France,</HI> the Packet-boat came &s;eldom without 10000 <HI>Louis d'Or's,</HI> it brought often more; The Na|tion was filled with them, and in &s;ix months time, a Million of Gui$span$s were coined out of them; The Merchants indeed &s;aid, that the ballance of Trade was then &s;o much turned to our &s;ide, that, whereas we were wont to carry over a Million of our
<PB N="258" REF="279">
Money in Specie, we then &s;ent no money to <HI>France;</HI> and had at lea&s;t half that Sum &s;ent over to ballance the Trade: yet this did not account for that va&s;t flood of <HI>French</HI> Gold, that was vi&s;ible among&s;t us: And, upon the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador's going away, a very &s;en&s;ible alteration was found in the Bills of Ex|change; So it was concluded, that great remittances were made to him, and that the&s;e were di&s;tributed among tho&s;e, who re&s;olved to merit a &s;hare in that Wealth, which came over now &s;o copiou&s;ly, beyond the example of former times. The King, in his Speech to the Parliament, in the mo&s;t effectual manner po&s;&s;ible, recommended the &s;ettling the Succe&s;&s;ion of the Crown, in the Prote&s;tant Line; and with relation to Foreign affairs, he laid them before the Two Hou&s;es, that they might offer him &s;uch Advices, as the State of the Nation and her Alliances re|quired: but he did not &s;o much as intimate to them his own thoughts concerning them. A de&s;ign was laid, in the Hou&s;e of Commons, to open the Se&s;&s;ion with an Addre&s;s to the King, that he would own the King of <HI>Spain;</HI> The matter was &s;o far concerted, that they had agreed on the words of the Vote, and &s;eemed not to doubt of the concurrence of the Hou&s;e; but Mr. <HI>Monkton</HI> oppo&s;ed it with great heat, and among other things &s;aid, if that Vote was carried, he &s;hould expect that the next Vote to be put, would be for owning the pretended Prince of <HI>Wales:</HI> Upon this occa&s;ion it appeared, how much popular A&s;&s;emblies are apt to be turned, by a thing boldly &s;aid, tho' the con&s;equence is ever &s;o remote; &s;ince the connection of the&s;e two points lay at &s;ome di&s;tance, yet the i&s;&s;ue of the Debate was quite contrary to that which was de&s;igned: It ended in an Addre&s;s to the King, to enter into new Alliances with the <HI>States,</HI> for our mutual Defence, and for pre&s;erving the Liberty and Peace of <HI>Europe;</HI> The&s;e la&s;t words were not carried, without much dif|ficulty: They were con&s;idered, as they were indeed, an in&s;inu|ation towards a War.</P>
<P>Upon the view of the Hou&s;e, it appeared very evidently, that <NOTE PLACE="marg">Partiality in judging E|lections.</NOTE> the Tories were a great Majority; yet they, to make the mat|ter &s;ure, re&s;olved to clear the Hou&s;e of a great many, that were engaged in another intere&s;t: Reports were brought to them of Elections, that had been &s;candalou&s;ly purcha&s;ed, by &s;ome who were concerned in the new <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company; in&s;tead of Drinking and Entertainments, by which Elections were formerly managed, now a mo&s;t &s;candalous practice was brought in of buying Votes, with &s;o little decency, that the Electors engaged them&s;elves by Sub&s;cription, to chu&s;e a blank per&s;on, before they were tru&s;ted with the name of their Candi|date.
<PB N="259" REF="280">
The old <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company had driven a cour&s;e of Corruption within doors with &s;o little &s;hame, that the new Company intended to follow their example, but with this dif|ference, that, whereas the former had bought the per&s;ons who were elected, they re&s;olved to buy Elections. Sir <HI>Edward Sei|mour,</HI> who had dealt in this Corruption his whole life-time, and whom the old Company was &s;aid to have bought before, at a very high price, brought before the Hou&s;e of Commons the di&s;covery of &s;ome of the practices of the New Company: The examining into the&s;e took up many days; In conclu&s;ion, the matter was &s;o well proved, that &s;everal Elections were declared void: and &s;ome of the per&s;ons &s;o cho&s;en, were for &s;ome time kept in pri&s;on; after that they were expelled the Hou&s;e. In the&s;e proceedings, great partiality appeared; for when in &s;ome ca&s;es, Corruption was proved clearly, again&s;t &s;ome of the Tory Party, and but doubtfully again&s;t &s;ome of the contrary &s;ide, that, which was voted Corruption in the latter, was called the giving Alms in tho&s;e of the former &s;ort. Thus for &s;ome weeks, the Hou&s;e &s;eemed to have forgot all the Concerns of <HI>Europe,</HI> and was wholly imployed in the weakening of one &s;ide, and in fortifying the other; To make &s;ome &s;hew of zeal for the Publick &s;afety, they voted thirty thou&s;and Men for the Fleet; But they would allow no Marines, tho' they were told, that a Fleet without the&s;e was only a good &s;ecurity for our own De|fence, but could have no influence on the Affairs of <HI>Europe,</HI> ei|ther to frighten or to encourage tho&s;e abroad: Such a Fleet as it could not offend, &s;o it was much too &s;trong, if it was intend|ed only for a defence, and it looked like a needle&s;s wa&s;ting the Trea&s;ure of the Nation, to imploy &s;o much of it to &s;o little purpo&s;e, and only to make a &s;hew.</P>
<P>While the Hou&s;e of Commons was going on, minding only <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parti|tion Treaty charged in the Hou&s;e of Lords.</NOTE> Party matters, a de&s;ign was laid in the Hou&s;e of Lords, to at|tack the Partition Treaty and &s;ome of tho&s;e, who were con|cerned in it; They begun with an Addre&s;s to the King, that he would order all the Treaties made, &s;ince the Peace of <HI>Ry&s;|wick,</HI> to be laid before them. This was complied with &s;o &s;lowly, that they were not brought to the Hou&s;e till the <HI>26th</HI> of <HI>Fe|bruary,</HI> and no notice was taken of them, till the <HI>10th</HI> of <HI>March;</HI> It &s;oon appeared that this was done by a <HI>French</HI> di|rection. The Court of <HI>France</HI> (perceiving that the <HI>Dutch</HI> were alarmed at their neighbourhood, and were encrea&s;ing their force, both by Sea and Land, and were calling upon their Al|lies to furni&s;h their Quota's, which they were bound by Trea|ties to &s;end to their defence) enter'd upon a Negotiation with
<PB N="260" REF="281">
them at the <HI>Hague,</HI> to try what would lay the&s;e fears. Upon this, in the beginning of <HI>March,</HI> the <HI>States,</HI> in conjunction with Mr. <HI>Stanhope,</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Envoy at the <HI>Hague,</HI> gave in Memorials, in which they in&s;i&s;ted on the violation of the Par|tition Treaty, and particularly on the <HI>French</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them|&s;elves of the <HI>Spani&s;h Netherlands:</HI> They al&s;o de&s;ired, that the Emperor might have ju&s;t &s;atisfaction in his preten&s;ions, and that in the mean while, <HI>Luxemburgh, Namur, Mons,</HI> and <HI>Aeth,</HI> might be put in their hands; and <HI>O&s;tend</HI> and <HI>Newport</HI> into the hands of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and both they and the <HI>Dutch</HI> might have a free Trade, as before, to all the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Dominions. The <HI>French</HI> &s;eeing the&s;e demands run &s;o high, and being re&s;olved to offer no other &s;ecurity for the Peace of <HI>Europe,</HI> but the renew|ing the Treaty of <HI>Ry&s;wick,</HI> &s;et all their Engines at work in <HI>England,</HI> to involve us into &s;uch contentions at home, as &s;hould both di&s;able us, from taking any care of Foreign affairs, and make the re&s;t of <HI>Europe</HI> conclude, that nothing con&s;iderable was to be expected from <HI>England.</HI> A&s;&s;oon as the news of tho&s;e Memorials could come to <HI>England,</HI> the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Nor|manby</HI> and the re&s;t of the Tories, took up the Debate concerning the Partition Treaty: This they managed with great dexterity, while the matter was as much neglected by the King, who went that day to <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> where he &s;tay'd &s;ome time; by this means, no directions were given, and we were involved in great difficulties, before the Court was aware of it: The King either could not prevail with his new Mini&s;ters to excu&s;e the Treaty, if they would not ju&s;tify it; or he neglected them &s;o far, as not to &s;peak to them at all about it. Tho&s;e, who attack'd it, &s;aid, they meant nothing in that but to offer the King Advices for the future, to prevent &s;uch errors as had been committed in that Treaty, both as to matter and form. They blamed the giving &s;uch Territories to the Crown of <HI>France,</HI> and the for&s;aking the Emperor; They al&s;o complained of the &s;ecrecy, in which the Treaty was carried on, it not being com|municated to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Council or Mini&s;try, but privately tran&s;acted by the Earls of <HI>Portland</HI> and <HI>Jer&s;ey:</HI> They al&s;o blam|ed the putting the Great Seal, fir&s;t to blank Powers, and then to the Treaty it&s;elf, which the King's new Mini&s;ters &s;aid, was unju&s;t in the contrivance, and ridiculous in the execution. To all this, it was an&s;wered, that there not being a Force ready and &s;ufficient to hinder the <HI>French</HI> from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them&s;elves of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy, which they were prepared for, the Emperor had de&s;ired the King to enter into a Treaty of Par|tition, and had con&s;ented to every Article of it, except that
<PB N="261" REF="282">
which related to the Dutchy of <HI>Milan;</HI> But the King, not think|ing that worth the engaging in a new War, had obtain'd an ex|change of it for the Dutchy of <HI>Lorrain:</HI> The Emperor did not agree to this, yet he pre&s;&s;ed the King not to break off the Treaty, but to get the be&s;t terms he could for him, and above all things, he recommended &s;ecrecy, that &s;o he might not lo&s;e his intere&s;t in <HI>Spain,</HI> by &s;eeming to con&s;ent to this Partition: It is certain, that by our Con&s;titution, all Foreign Negotiations were tru&s;ted entirely to the Crown; that the King was under no obligation by Law, to communicate &s;uch &s;ecrets to his Coun|cil, or to hear, much le&s;s was he obliged to follow their Ad|vices: In particular it was &s;aid, that the Keeper of the Great Seal had no &s;ort of authority, to deny the putting it, either to Powers for a Treaty, or to any Treaty which the King &s;hould agree to: The Law gives no direction in &s;uch matters, and he could not refu&s;e to put the Great Seal to any thing, for which he had an Order from the King, unle&s;s the matter was contrary to Law, which had made no provi&s;ion in this ca&s;e: They in|&s;i&s;ted mo&s;t on the other &s;ide, upon the concluding a Treaty of this importance, without communicating it fir&s;t to the Privy Council; &s;o the fir&s;t day of the Debate ended with this.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Portland</HI> apprehending that this might fall too hea|vy <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lords advi&s;ed with in i$ oppo&s;ed it.</NOTE> on him, got the King's leave to communicate the whole matter next day to the Hou&s;e; So he told them, that he had not concluded the Treaty alone, but had, by the King's Order, acquainted &s;ix of his chief Mini&s;ters with it, who were the Earls of <HI>Pembroke</HI> and <HI>Marlborough,</HI> the Vi&s;count <HI>Lon&s;dale,</HI> the Lords <HI>Somers</HI> and <HI>Hali|fax,</HI> and Secretary <HI>Vernon;</HI> Upon which tho&s;e Lords, being likewi&s;e freed by the King from the Oath of Secrecy, told the Hou&s;e, that the Earl of <HI>Jer&s;ey,</HI> having in the King's Name called them together, the Treaty was read to them, and that they excepted to &s;eve|ral things in it, but they were told, that the King had carried the matter as far as was po&s;&s;ible, and that he could obtain no better terms: So when they were told, that no alterations could be made, but that every thing was &s;ettled, they gave over in|&s;i&s;ting on particulars; they only advi&s;ed, that the King might not engage him&s;elf in any thing, that would bring on a new War, &s;ince the Nation had been &s;o unea&s;y under the la&s;t. This was carried to the King, and a few days after that, he told &s;ome of them, that he was made acquainted with their excep|tions, but how rea&s;onable &s;oever they were, he had driven the matter as far as he could; The Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> &s;aid to the Hou&s;e of Lords, he had offered the King tho&s;e Advices, that he thought were mo&s;t for his &s;ervice, and for the good of the
<PB N="262" REF="283">
Nation; but that he did not think him&s;elf bound to give an account of that, to any other per&s;ons; He was not the man &s;truck at, &s;o there was nothing &s;aid, either again&s;t him, or the Earls of <HI>Marlborough</HI> or <HI>Jer&s;ey:</HI> Upon this, the Debate went on; Some &s;aid, this was a mockery, to ask advice, when there was no room for it: It was an&s;wered, the King had asked the ad|vice of his Privy Council, and they had given it; but that, &s;uch was the Regal Prerogative, that it was &s;till free to him to follow it or not, as he &s;aw cau&s;e.</P>
<P>In conclu&s;ion, the Hou&s;e of Lords re&s;olved to &s;et out this <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Addre&s;s to the King about it.</NOTE> whole matter, in an Addre&s;s to the King, complaining both of the Partition Treaty, and of the method in which it had been carried on; The Lord <HI>Wharton</HI> moved an addition to the Ad|dre&s;s, that, whereas the <HI>French</HI> King had broke that Treaty, they &s;hould advi&s;e the King to treat no more with him, or rely on his word without further &s;ecurity: This was much oppo&s;ed, by all tho&s;e who were again&s;t the engaging in a new War; They &s;aid, all Motions of that kind ought to come from the Hou&s;e of Commons, who only could &s;upport &s;uch an Advice, that did upon the matter engage us into a new War; nor would they lay any blame on the breaking of a Treaty, which they were re&s;olved to condemn: They al&s;o excepted to the words <HI>further &s;ecurity</HI> as ambiguous; yet the Majority of the Hou&s;e agreed to it; for there was &s;uch treachery in the <HI>French</HI> Negotiations, that they could not be relied on, without a good Guarantee, and the Pledge of &s;ome &s;trong places. It now plain|ly appeared, that the de&s;ign was, to &s;et on the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, to impeach &s;ome of the Lords, who had been concern|ed in the Partition Treaty, for it was moved to &s;end the Ad|dre&s;s to the Hou&s;e of Commons, for their concurrence; but that was not carried. The King &s;eemed to bear all this with his u&s;ual coldne&s;s: and the new Mini&s;ters continued &s;till in his confidence, but he laid the matter much to heart; Now he &s;aw the error he had fallen into, by the change he had made in the Mini&s;try: It was plain they re&s;olved to govern him in every thing, and not to be governed by him in any one thing.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as this was over, the Earl of <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> did, by the King's Order, bring to the Hou&s;e of Lords the Memorials that had <NOTE PLACE="marg">Memorials $$nt from the States.</NOTE> been given in at the <HI>Hague,</HI> and then, by comparing Dates, it was ea&s;y to conjecture, why the Partition Treaty had been let lie &s;o long on the Table, and it &s;eemed as if it was taken up at la&s;t, only to bla&s;t this Negotiation; A <HI>French</HI> management appearing very plainly in the whole &s;teps, that had been made.

The Hou&s;e of Commons began, at the &s;ame time, not only to complain of the Partition Treaty, but likewi&s;e of the demand of <HI>O&s;tend</HI> and <HI>Newport,</HI> nor would they &s;hew any concern for the Emperor's preten&s;ions: The <HI>Dutch</HI> demanded the execu|tion of the Treaty, that King <HI>Charles</HI> had made with them, in the year 1677, by which <HI>England</HI> was bound to a&s;&s;i&s;t them with ten thou&s;and Men and twenty Ships of War, if they were attack'd; Some endeavoured, all that was po&s;&s;ible, to put this off for the pre&s;ent, pretending that they were not yet at|tack'd: Others moved, that the pay of ten thou&s;and Men might be given to them, with the twenty Ships, as a full equi|valent to the Treaty; yet they not liking this, it was in con|clu&s;ion agreed to &s;end the ten thou&s;and Men: five thou&s;and of the&s;e were to be drawn out of the Army in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and five thou&s;and of them were to be new levied; but they took care, that <HI>Ireland</HI> &s;hould not be provided with any new Forces in their &s;tead, &s;o jealous were they of tru&s;ting the King with an Army. The repre&s;entation &s;ent over by the <HI>States,</HI> &s;etting forth the danger they were in, and de&s;iring the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> was penned with great &s;pirit, and in a very moving &s;train; The Hou&s;e of Lords did, upon a Debate on that &s;ubject, make an Addre&s;s to the King, to enter into Leagues Offen&s;ive and Defen&s;ive, with the Emperor and other Princes and <HI>States,</HI> who were intere&s;ted again&s;t the conjunction of the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchies; But the Hou&s;e of Commons could not, upon this occa&s;ion, be carried further, than to advi&s;e the King to enter into &s;uch Alliances, as &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary, for our common &s;ecurity, and for the Peace of <HI>Europe.</HI> This coldne&s;s and uncertainty in our Councils, gave the <HI>French</HI> great advan|tages in their Negotiations, both in <HI>Germany</HI> and in <HI>Portugal;</HI> They tried the Courts of <HI>Italy,</HI> but without &s;ucce&s;s; only the Duke of <HI>Mantua</HI> con&s;ented, that they &s;hould make a &s;hew, as if they had &s;urprized him, and &s;o force him to put <HI>Mantua</HI> in their hands: The Pope and the <HI>Venetians</HI> would not declare them&s;elves; the Pope favoured the <HI>French,</HI> as the <HI>Venetians</HI> did the Emperor; who began the War with a preten&s;ion on the Dutchy of <HI>Milan,</HI> as a Fief of the Empire that devolved on him; and he was making Magazines, both in <HI>Tirol</HI> and at <HI>Trent:</HI> The <HI>French</HI> &s;eemed to de&s;pi&s;e all he could do, and did not apprehend, that it was po&s;&s;ible for him to march an Army into <HI>Italy;</HI> Both the King and the <HI>States</HI> pre&s;&s;ed him to make that attempt; The Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and &s;ome of the Circles, had agreed to a Neutrality this year; So there was no hope of doing much upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> were making the

<P>The handle, that brought this about, was given by the Earl <NOTE PLACE="marg">A de&s;ign to impeach the former Mi|ni&s;try.</NOTE> of <HI>Portland;</HI> When he was excu&s;ing his own part in the Par|tition Treaty, he &s;aid, that having withdrawn him&s;elf from bu&s;ine&s;s, and being at his Country Hou&s;e in <HI>Holland,</HI> the King &s;ent to him, de&s;iring him to enter upon that Negotiation; up|on that, he wrote to Secretary <HI>Vernon,</HI> to ask his advice and the advice of his other Friends, whether it was fit for him to meddle in that matter, &s;ince his being by Birth a Foreigner, &s;eemed a ju&s;t excu&s;e for not engaging in a thing of &s;uch con&s;e|quence; To this Secretary <HI>Vernon</HI> an&s;wered, that all his friends thought he was a very proper per&s;on, to be imployed in that Treaty, &s;ince he had known the progre&s;s of all tho&s;e Treaties, and the per&s;ons, who were imployed on that occa&s;ion; and he named the Lord <HI>Somers</HI> among tho&s;e, who had advi&s;ed this. The Earl of <HI>Portland</HI> had mi&s;taken this circum&s;tance, which did not belong to the la&s;t Partition Treaty, but to that of the year before, in favour of the Prince Electoral of <HI>Bavaria.</HI> The Hou&s;e of Commons, hearing of this, required Secretary <HI>Vernon</HI> to lay before them that Letter, with his an&s;wer to it; for the Earl of <HI>Portland</HI> &s;aid, that he had left all Papers, relating to that matter, in <HI>Holland. Vernon</HI> &s;aid, he had received no &s;uch Letter in the year 1699; So that led them to enquire farther, and they required him, to lay before them all the Letters he had, relating to both Treaties: He &s;aid, tho&s;e were the King's Se|crets, writ in confidence, by the per&s;ons he imployed; But in &s;uch a ca&s;e, a Hou&s;e of Commons will not be put off: a deni|al rather rai&s;es in them more earne&s;tne&s;s, in following their point; It was &s;aid, the King had di&s;pen&s;ed with the Oath of Secrecy, when he ordered all matters to be laid before them, and they would admit of no excu&s;e. <HI>Vernon</HI> upon this went to the King, and told him, &s;ince the&s;e were his Secrets, he was ready to expo&s;e him&s;elf to the indignation of the Hou&s;e, and to refu&s;e to &s;hew his Letters: But the King &s;aid, his refu&s;ing to do it would not only rai&s;e a &s;torm again&s;t him&s;elf, from which the King could not protect him, but it would occa&s;ion an Ad|dre&s;s

to the King, to order him to lay every thing before the Hou&s;e, which, in the &s;tate that things were in then, he could not deny: <HI>Vernon,</HI> upon the&s;e Orders given him, at two dif|ferent times, carried all the Letters, and laid them before the Hou&s;e of Commons; It appeared by the&s;e, that he had com|municated the Treaty to the King's Mini&s;ters, who were in Town, about the end of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1698; That Lord <HI>Somers</HI> be|ing then at <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> he went to him; and that he had com|municated the Project, both to the Earl of <HI>Orford</HI> and the Lord <HI>Halifax;</HI> Several objections were made by them to many parts of the Treaty, which were mentioned in <HI>Vernon</HI>'s Letters; but, if better terms could not be had, they thought it was better to conclude the Treaty, than to leave the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy, to be over-run by <HI>France,</HI> or to involve <HI>Europe</HI> in a new War; Lord <HI>Somers</HI> had al&s;o put the Seals to Blank Powers, for con|cluding this Treaty. When all this was read, tho&s;e, who were &s;et on to blow up the flame, moved the Hou&s;e to impeach &s;ome of the Mini&s;ters, who had been concerned in this tran&s;ac|tion; yet in this they proceded, with &s;o vi&s;ible a partiality, that tho' the Earl of <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> had &s;igned the Treaty, had been Plenipotentiary at <HI>Ry&s;wick,</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador in <HI>France,</HI> and Secreta|ry of State, while the Partition Treaty was negotiating; yet he, having joined him&s;elf to the new Mini&s;try, was not que&s;tioned about it: The Party &s;aid, he had been too ea&s;ily drawn into it, but that he was not in the Secret, and had no &s;hare in the Councils, that projected it.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t of <HI>April,</HI> the Hou&s;e of Commons brought up a <NOTE PLACE="marg">They are impeached.</NOTE> general Impeachment of the Earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> for high Crimes and Mi&s;demeanors; but the chief de&s;ign was again&s;t the Earl of <HI>Orford,</HI> and the Lords <HI>Somers</HI> and <HI>Halifax.</HI> Their Ene|mies tried again what u&s;e could be made of <HI>Kid</HI>'s bu&s;ine&s;s, for he was taken in our Northern <HI>Plantations</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> and brought over: He was examined by the Hou&s;e, but either he could not lay a probable &s;tory together, or &s;ome remnants of hone&s;ty, rai&s;ed in him by the near pro&s;pect of death, re&s;trained him; he accu&s;ed no per&s;on of having advi&s;ed or encouraged his turning Pirate; He had never talked alone with any of the Lords, and never at all with Lord <HI>Somers:</HI> He &s;aid, he had no Orders from them, but to pur&s;ue his Voyage again&s;t the Pirates in <HI>Madaga&s;car;</HI> All endeavours were u&s;ed to per&s;uade him to accu&s;e the Lords; he was a&s;&s;ured that if he did it, he &s;hould be pre&s;erved; and if he did it not, he &s;hould certainly did for his Piracy; yet this could not prevail on him to charge them: So he, with &s;ome of his Crew, were hanged, there ap|pearing

not &s;o much as a colour to fa&s;ten any imputation on tho&s;e Lords; yet their Enemies tried, what u&s;e could be made of the Grant of all that <HI>Kid</HI> might recover from the Pirates, which &s;ome bold and ignorant Lawyers affirmed to be again&s;t Law. So this matter was for the fourth time debated in the Hou&s;e of Commons, and the behaviour of tho&s;e Peers in it appeared to be &s;o innocent, &s;o legal and in truth &s;o meritorious, that it was again let fall. The in&s;i&s;ting &s;o much on it, &s;erved to convince all people, that the enemies of the&s;e Lords wanted not inclinations, but only matter to charge them, &s;ince they made &s;o much u&s;e of this; But &s;o partial was a great part of the Hou&s;e, that the dropping this was carried only by a &s;mall Majority: When one de&s;ign failed, another was &s;et up.</P>
<P>It was pretended, that by Secretary <HI>Vernon</HI>'s Letters it was <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord <HI>Somers</HI> heard by the Hou&s;e of Com|mons.</NOTE> clearly proved, that the Lord <HI>Somers</HI> had con&s;ented to the Par|tition Treaty; So a Debate coming on concerning that, Lord <HI>Somers</HI> de&s;ired that he might be admitted, to give an account of his &s;hare in it, to the Hou&s;e of Commons; Some oppo&s;i|tion was made to this, but it had been always granted, &s;o it could not be denied him; He had obtained the King's leave, to tell every thing; So that when he appeared before the Hou&s;e, he told them, the King had writ to him, that the &s;tate of the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s health was de&s;perate, and that he &s;aw no way to prevent a new War, but to accept of the propo&s;ition, the <HI>French</HI> made for a Partition: The King &s;ent him the Scheme of this, and ordered him to communicate it to &s;ome others, and to give him both his own opinion and theirs concerning it, and to &s;end him over Powers for a Treaty, but in the &s;ecrete&s;t manner that was po&s;&s;ible: Yet the King added, that, if he and his other Mini&s;ters thought that a Treaty ought not to be made upon &s;uch a Project, then the whole matter mu&s;t be let fall, for he could not bring the <HI>French</HI> to better terms. Lord <HI>So|mers</HI> upon this &s;aid, that he thought it was the taking too much upon him&s;elf, if he &s;hould have put a &s;top to a Treaty of &s;uch con&s;equence; If the King of <HI>Spain</HI> had died, before it was fini&s;hed, and the blame had been ca&s;t on him, for not &s;ending the nece&s;&s;ary Powers, becau&s;e he was not ordered to do it, by a Warrant in full form, he could not have ju&s;tified that, &s;ince the King's Letter was really a Warrant, and there|fore he thought he was bound to &s;end the Powers that were called for, which he had done. But at the &s;ame time, he wrote his own opinion very fully to the King, objecting to many particulars, if there was room for it, and propo&s;ing &s;e|veral things, which, as he thought, were for the good and in|tere&s;t
<PB N="267" REF="288">
of <HI>England.</HI> Soon after the Powers were &s;ent over by him, the Treaty was concluded, to which he put the Great Seal, as he thought he was bound to do: In this, as he was a Privy Councellor, he had offered the King his be&s;t advice, and as he was Chancellor, he had executed his Office according to his duty. As for putting the Seal to the Powers, he had done it upon the King's Letter, which was a real Warrant, tho' not a formal one: he had indeed de&s;ired, that a Warrant in due form might be &s;ent him for his own &s;ecurity; but he did not think it became him, to endanger the Publick, only for want of a point of Form, in &s;o critical a time, where great di&s;patch was requi&s;ite. He &s;poke &s;o fully and &s;o clearly, that, upon his with|drawing, it was believed, if the Que&s;tion had been quickly put, the whole matter had been &s;oon at an end, and that the pro|&s;ecution would have been let fall: But his enemies drew out the Debate to &s;uch a length, that the impre&s;&s;ion, which his Speech had made, was much worn out; and the Hou&s;e &s;itting till it was pa&s;t midnight, they at la&s;t carried it by a Majority of &s;even or eight to impeach him and the Earl of <HI>Orford</HI> and the Lord <HI>Halifax,</HI> of high Crimes and Mi&s;demeanors: The general Impeachment was brought up the next day to the Lords Bar.</P>
<P>The Commons were very &s;en&s;ible, that tho&s;e Impeachments <NOTE PLACE="marg">Contrary Addre&s;&s;es of the Two Hou&s;es.</NOTE> mu&s;t come to nothing, and that they had not a Majority in the Hou&s;e of Lords, to judge in them, as they &s;hould direct; So they re&s;olved on a &s;horter way, to fix a &s;evere cen&s;ure on the Lords, whom they had thus impeached; They voted an Addre&s;s to the King, for excluding them from his Pre&s;ence and Coun|cils for ever; This had never gone along with an Impeachment before; The Hou&s;e of Commons had indeed begun &s;uch a practice in King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second's time: When they di&s;liked a Mini&s;ter, but had not matter to ground an Impeachment on, they had taken this method, of making an Addre&s;s again&s;t him, but it was a new attempt, to come with an Addre&s;s af|ter an Impeachment: This was puni&s;hing before Trial, con|trary to an indi&s;pen&s;ible Rule of Ju&s;tice, of not judging before the Parties were heard: The Lords &s;aw, that this made their Judicature ridiculous, when, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance of an Accu&s;a|tion, application was made to the King for a Cen&s;ure, and a very &s;evere one; &s;ince few Mi&s;demeanors could de&s;erve a har|der Sentence. Upon the&s;e grounds, the Lords prevented the Commons, and &s;ent &s;ome of their Body to the King, with an Addre&s;s, praying him, that he would not proceed to any Cen|&s;ure of the&s;e Lords, till they had undergone their Trial. The
<PB N="268" REF="289">
King received the&s;e Addre&s;&s;es, &s;o contrary to one another, from both Hou&s;es, but made no an&s;wer to either of them; unle&s;s the letting the names of the&s;e Lords continue &s;till in the Council Books, might be taken as a refu&s;ing to grant what the Com|mons had de&s;ired. They renewed their Addre&s;s, but had no direct an&s;wer from the King; This, tho' a piece of common ju&s;tice, was complained of, and it was &s;aid, that the&s;e Lords had &s;till great credit with the King; The Commons had, for forms &s;ake, ordered a Committee to prepare Articles of Im|peachment, but they intended to let the matter &s;leep; think|ing that, what they had already done had &s;o marked tho&s;e Lords, that the King could not imploy them any more; for that was the main thing they drove at.</P>
<P>While this was in agitation, a Letter came to the King from the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> giving notice of his Acce&s;&s;ion to that Crown; <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King owned the King of <HI>Spain.</HI></NOTE> It was dated, the day after he entred into <HI>Spain,</HI> but the Date and the Letter were vi&s;ibly writ at different times; The King ordered the Letter to be read in the Cabinet Council; there was &s;ome &s;hort Debate concerning it, but it was never brought into any further deliberation there. The Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> &s;aw the King &s;eemed di&s;tru&s;tful of him, and re&s;erved to him in that matter, and was highly offended at it: He and the re&s;t of the new Mini&s;try pre&s;&s;ed the King, to own the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and to an&s;wer his Letter; and &s;ince the <HI>Dutch</HI> had done it, it &s;eemed rea&s;onable that the King &s;hould likewi&s;e do it; They prevailed at la&s;t, but with much difficulty; The thing was kept &s;ecret, and was not communicated to the Privy Council, or to the Two Hou&s;es, nor did the King &s;peak of it to any of the Foreign Mini&s;ters; The <HI>Paris Gazette</HI> gave the World the fir&s;t notice of it. This being carried in &s;uch a manner, &s;eem|ed the more &s;trange, becau&s;e his Mini&s;try had &s;o lately con|demned a former One, for not communicating the Partition Treaty to the Council, before it was concluded; and yet had, in a matter of great con&s;equence, &s;o &s;oon forgot the Cen&s;ures, they had thrown out &s;o liberally, upon the &s;ecrecy with which that matter had been tran&s;acted. While things were moving in &s;uch a &s;low and uncertain pace in <HI>England,</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> had daily new allarms brought them of the Forces, that the <HI>French</HI> were pouring into their Neighbourhood; into the <HI>Spani&s;h Guel|der</HI> on the one hand, and into <HI>Antwerp</HI> on the other; So that they were apprehen&s;ive of a de&s;ign, both upon <HI>Nimeguen</HI> and <HI>Bergen-op-zom:</HI> They took the be&s;t care they could to &s;ecure their Frontier: The Negotiations went on &s;lowly at the <HI>Hague;</HI> The <HI>French</HI> rejected all their demands, and offered nothing but

In the mean while they armed powerfully; and our Fleet, in conjunction with theirs, were Ma&s;ters of the Sea; but for want of Marines, they were in no condition to make any impre&s;&s;ion on the Ene|my. The Emperor went on, with his preparation for a Cam|paign in <HI>Italy;</HI> The <HI>French</HI> &s;ent an Army into the <HI>Milaneze,</HI> that they reckoned would be much &s;uperior to any Force the Emperor could &s;end thither; The Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> was engaged in the intere&s;t of <HI>France,</HI> by King <HI>Philip</HI>'s marrying his Second Daughter: The Pope &s;till refu&s;ed to give the Inve&s;titure of <HI>Na|ples,</HI> or to accept the Annual pre&s;ent; for he would not quite break with the Emperor.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> practices were every where the more prevalent, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Negotla|tions in &s;eve|ral places.</NOTE> becau&s;e they gave out that <HI>England</HI> would not engage in a War, and the face of our Affairs looked but dark at home; The Emperor's Mini&s;ters had an unea&s;y time among us; the King encouraged them, but the new Mini&s;ters were &s;carce civil to them, and &s;tudied to put them quite out of hope; The King of <HI>Denmark</HI> entered into a Treaty with the Emperor and the <HI>States;</HI> Great pains were taken to mediate a Peace between <HI>Sweden</HI> and <HI>Poland;</HI> The Court of <HI>France,</HI> as well as that of <HI>Vienna,</HI> tried it; both &s;ides hoping that <HI>Sweden,</HI> if not <HI>Poland,</HI> might enter into their intere&s;ts: The <HI>French</HI> reckoned that <HI>Den|mark</HI> and <HI>Sweden</HI> could never be on the &s;ame &s;ide; So, when they found they could not gain <HI>Denmark,</HI> they tried a Media|tion, hoping to get <HI>Sweden</HI> into an Alliance with them, but all attempts for a Mediation proved un&s;ucce&s;sful.

The manner, in which this motion of the Succe&s;&s;ion was managed, did not carry in it great marks of &s;incerity; It was often put off from one day to another, and it gave place to the mo&s;t trifling matters; at la&s;t, when a day was &s;olemnly &s;et for it, and all people expect|ed, that it &s;hould pa&s;s without any difficulty, <HI>Harley</HI> moved, that &s;ome things previous to that might be fir&s;t con&s;idered.

When &s;ome time had been &s;pent in tho&s;e Preliminaries, it came to the nomination of the Per&s;on; Sir <HI>John Bowles,</HI> who was then di&s;ordered in his Sen&s;es, and &s;oon after quite lo&s;t them, was &s;et on by the Party, to be the fir&s;t that &s;hould name the Electore&s;s Dowager of <HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> which &s;eemed done to make it le&s;s &s;erious, when moved by &s;uch a per&s;on: He was, by the Forms of the Hou&s;e, put in the Chair of the Committee, to whom the Bill was committed: The thing was &s;till put off for many weeks; At every time that it was called for, the motion was entertained with cold|ne&s;s, which &s;erved to heighten the jealou&s;y; The Committee once or twice &s;ate upon it, but all the Members ran out of the Hou&s;e, with &s;o much indecency, that the Contrivers &s;eem|ed a&s;hamed of this management: There were &s;eldom fifty or &s;ixty at the Committee; yet in conclu&s;ion, it pa&s;t and was &s;ent up to the Lords; where we expected great oppo&s;ition would be made to it: Some imagined, the Act was only an artifice, de&s;igned to gain credit to tho&s;e, who at this time were &s;o ill thought of over the Nation, that they wanted &s;ome colourable thing, to excu&s;e their other proceedings: Many of the Lords ab&s;ented them&s;elves on de&s;ign; Some little oppo&s;ition was made by the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Normanby;</HI> And four Lords, the Earls of <HI>Hun|tington</HI> and <HI>Plymouth</HI> and the Lords <HI>Guilford</HI> and <HI>Jefferies,</HI> prote&s;ted again&s;t it. Tho&s;e, who wi&s;ht well to the Act, were glad to have it pa&s;&s;ed any way, and &s;o would not examine the Limitations that were in it; They thought it of great impor|tance to carry the Act, and that, at another time, tho&s;e Li|mitations might be better con&s;idered: So the Act pa&s;&s;ed, and the King &s;ent it over by the Earl of <HI>Macclesfield</HI> to the Elec|tore&s;s, together with the Garter to the <HI>Elector.</HI> We reckoned it a great point carried, that we had now a Law on our &s;ide, for a Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;or; for we plainly &s;aw, a great Party formed again&s;t it, in favour of the pretended Prince of <HI>Wales.</HI> He was now pa&s;t thirteen, bred up with a hatred both of our Religion and our Con&s;titution, in an admiration of the <HI>French</HI> Government; and yet many who called them&s;elves Prote&s;tants, &s;eemed fond of &s;uch a Succe&s;&s;or; a degree of infatuation that might ju&s;tly amaze all who ob&s;erved it, and &s;aw the fury with which it was promoted.</P>

<P>The Impeachments lay long neglected in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceedings upon the Impeach|ments.</NOTE> and probably they would have been let &s;leep, if the Lords concerned had not moved for a Trial; On their motion, Me&s;|&s;ages were &s;ent to the Commons to quicken their Proceedings; At la&s;t, Articles were framed and brought up, fir&s;t again&s;t the Earl of <HI>Orford:</HI> He was charged for taking great Grants from <NOTE PLACE="marg">And fir&s;t, The Articles again&s;t the Earl of <HI>Or|ford.</HI></NOTE> the King; <HI>Kid</HI>'s bu&s;ine&s;s was objected to him; he was al&s;o charged for abu&s;es in managing the Fleet, and victualling it, when it lay on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Spain,</HI> and for &s;ome Orders he had given, during his Command; and in conclu&s;ion, for his ad|vi&s;ing the Partition Treaty.

the King was bound to maintain the Emperor's right to that Succe&s;&s;ion: yet this was not intended by tho&s;e, who managed the Party, who had not hitherto given any countenance to the Em|peror's preten&s;ions: So apt are Parties to make u&s;e of any thing, that may &s;erve a turn, without con&s;idering the con&s;equences of it.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Orford</HI> put in his An&s;wer in four days; He <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earl of <HI>Orford</HI>'s An&s;wer.</NOTE> &s;aid he had no Grant of the King, but a Rever&s;ion at a great di&s;tance, and a Gift of ten thou&s;and Pounds, after he had de|feated the <HI>French</HI> at <HI>La Hogue,</HI> which he thought he might lawfully accept of, as all others before him had done: He opened <HI>Kid</HI>'s matter, in which he had acted legally, with good intentions to the publick, and to his own lo&s;s: His Accounts, while he commanded the Fleet, had been all examined and were pa&s;t; but he was ready to wave that, and to ju&s;tify him|&s;elf in every particular, and he denied his having given any Advice about the Partition Treaty; This was immediately &s;ent down to the Commons; But they let it lie before them, with|out coming to a replication; which is only a piece of Form, by which they undertake to make good their charge.</P>

He put in his An&s;wer in a very few days: In the Partition Trea|ty, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord <HI>Somers</HI> An&s;wer.</NOTE> he &s;aid, he had offered the King very faithful advice as a Coun&s;ellor, and had acted according to the duty of his Po&s;t, as Chancellor; So he had nothing more to an&s;wer for: As for his Grants, the King de&s;igned him a Grant to &s;uch a value; The King was not deceived in the value; The manner of pa&s;|&s;ing it, was according to the u&s;ual methods of the Trea&s;ury, in order to make a Grant &s;ure, and out of the danger of be|ing avoided. <HI>Kid</HI>'s bu&s;ine&s;s was opened, as was formerly &s;et forth; and as to the Court of Chancery, he had applied him|&s;elf wholly to the di&s;patch of bu&s;ine&s;s in it, with little regard to his own health or quiet, and had acted according to the be&s;t of his judgment, without fear or favour. This was pre&s;ently

&s;ent down to the Hou&s;e of Commons, and upon that they were at a full &s;tand: They framed no Articles again&s;t the Earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> which was repre&s;ented to the King, as an expre&s;&s;ion of their re&s;pect to him.</P>
<P>Some time after this, near the end of the Se&s;&s;ion, they &s;ent up Articles again&s;t the Lord <HI>Halifax,</HI> which I mention here, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Articles of Impeach|ment again&s;t Lord <HI>Hali|fax.</HI></NOTE> that I may end this matter all at once; They charged him for a Grant that he had in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and that he had not pay'd in the produce of it, as the Act concerning tho&s;e Grants had enacted: They charged him for another Grant, out of the Fo|re&s;t of <HI>Dean,</HI> to the wa&s;te of the Timber, and prejudice of the Navy of <HI>England:</HI> They charged him, for holding Places that were incompatible, being at the &s;ame time both a Com|mi&s;&s;ioner of the Trea&s;ury, and Auditor of the Exchequer; and in conclu&s;ion, he was charged for advi&s;ing the two Partition Treaties. He was as quick with his An&s;wer as the other Lords <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord <HI>Hali|fax</HI>'s An|&s;wer.</NOTE> had been; He &s;aid, his Grant in <HI>Ireland</HI> was of &s;ome Debts and Sums of Money, and &s;o was not thought to be within the Act, concerning confi&s;cated E&s;tates; All he had ever received of it was four hundred pounds; If he was bound to repay it, he was liable to an action for it; but every man was not to be impeach|ed, who did not pay his Debts, at the day of payment. His Grant in the Fore&s;t of <HI>Dean</HI> was only of the Weedings; &s;o it could be no wa&s;te of Timber, nor a prejudice to the Navy; The Auditor's place was held by another, till he obtained the King's leave to withdraw from the Trea&s;ury; As for the fir&s;t Partition Treaty, he never once &s;aw it, nor was he ever advi&s;ed with in it; As for the &s;econd, he gave his Advice very freely about it, at the &s;ingle time, in which he had ever heard any thing con|cerning it; This was &s;ent down to the Commons, but was ne|ver &s;o much as once read by them. When, by the&s;e Articles and the An&s;wers to them, it appeared, that after all the noi&s;e and clamour that had been rai&s;ed again&s;t the former Mini&s;try (more particularly again&s;t the Lord <HI>Halifax)</HI> for the great wa&s;te of Trea&s;ure, during their Admini&s;tration, that now, upon the &s;tricte&s;t &s;earch, all ended in &s;uch poor accu&s;ations; it turn|ed the minds of many, that had been formerly prejudiced a|gain&s;t them. It appeared, that it was the animo&s;ity of a Party at be&s;t, if it was not a <HI>French</HI> practice, to ruine men, who had &s;erved the King faithfully, and to di&s;courage others, from engaging them&s;elves &s;o far in his Intere&s;ts, as the&s;e Lords had done.

rai&s;e a &s;pirit in the Nation, for &s;upporting &s;uch an important and dangerous War, as this now in pro&s;pect was like to prove.</P>
<P>This gave a general di&s;gu&s;t to all <HI>England,</HI> more particular|ly <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pro|ceedings of Parliament much cen|&s;ured.</NOTE> to the City of <HI>London,</HI> where Foreign affairs and the intere&s;t of Trade were generally better under&s;tood; The old <HI>Ea&s;t-In|dia</HI> Company, tho' they hated the Mini&s;try that &s;et up the new, and &s;tudied to &s;upport this Hou&s;e of Commons, from whom they expected much favour; yet they, as well as the re&s;t of the City, &s;aw vi&s;ibly that fir&s;t the ruine of Trade, and then, as a con&s;equence of that, the ruine of the Nation mu&s;t cer|tainly en&s;ue, if <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> were once firmly united: So they began openly to condemn the proceedings of the Com|mons, and to own a jealou&s;y, that the <HI>Louis d'Or's</HI> &s;ent hither of late, had not come over to <HI>England</HI> for nothing. This di&s;po&s;ition to blame the &s;lowne&s;s, in which the Hou&s;e of Com|mons proceeded, with relation to Foreign Affairs, and the heat with which private quarrels were pur&s;ued, began to &s;pread it &s;elf thro' the whole Nation. Tho&s;e of the County of <HI>Kent</HI> &s;ent up a Petition to the Hou&s;e, de&s;iring them to mind the Pub|lick <NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Kenti&s;h</HI> Petition.</NOTE> more, and their private heats le&s;s, and to turn their Ad|dre&s;&s;es to the King, to Bills of Supplies, to enable him both to protect the Nation, and to defend our Allies. This was brought up by &s;ome Per&s;ons of Quality, and was pre&s;ented by them to the Hou&s;e: But it was looked on as a Libel on their Proceed|ings; and the Gentlemen, who brought it up, were &s;ent to Pri&s;on; where they lay till the Prorogation, but they were much vi&s;ited and treated as Confe&s;&s;ors. This was highly cen&s;ured; it was &s;aid, the Commons were the Creatures of the People, and upon all other occa&s;ions, they u&s;ed to favour and encourage Petitions: This feverity was condemned therefore as unnatural, and without a precedent: It was much que&s;tioned, whether they had really an Authority to Impri&s;on any except their own Mem|bers, or &s;uch as had violated the Privilege of their Hou&s;e: But the Party thought it was convenient, by &s;uch an unu&s;ual &s;eve|rity, to di&s;courage others from following the example &s;et them by tho&s;e of <HI>Kent:</HI> for a de&s;ign was laid to get Addre&s;&s;es of the &s;ame nature, from all parts of the Kingdom, chiefly from the City of <HI>London.</HI> The Mini&s;ters repre&s;ented to the King, what an indignity this would be to the Hou&s;e of Commons; and that, if he did not di&s;courage it, he might look for unac|ceptable things from them. It might rather di&s;courage, than give heart to our Allies, if they &s;hould &s;ee &s;uch a disjointing, and both City and Country in an oppo&s;ition to the Hou&s;e of Commons; Some went in his Name, to the eminent

Men of the City, to divert it, yet with all this it came &s;o near, for &s;uch an Addre&s;s, in a Common Council, that the Lord Mayor's Vote turned it for the Negative, &s;o that fell. But a di&s;|po&s;ition to a War, and to a more hearty concurrence with the King, appeared to be the general &s;en&s;e of the Nation, and this had a great effect on the Hou&s;e of Commons: They began to talk of a War as unavoidable; and when the Se&s;&s;ion drew near an end, they, by an Addre&s;s de&s;ired the King to enter into &s;uch Alliances with the Emperor, and other States and Princes, as were nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of us and our Allies, and to bring down the exorbitant Power of <HI>France.</HI> This was op|po&s;ed with great zeal by tho&s;e, who were looked on as the chief Conductors of the Jacobite Party, tho' many, who had in other things gone along with them, thought this was the only mean that was left, to recover their Credit with the people: for the current ran &s;o &s;trong for a War, that tho&s;e, who &s;trug|gled again&s;t it, were looked on as little better than publick E|nemies. They had found good Funds for a Million and a half; It is true, one of the&s;e was very unacceptable to the King: It was ob&s;erved, that the allotment for the Civil Lift did far exceed the Sum that was de&s;igned, which was only &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds, and that, as King <HI>James</HI>'s Queen would not take her Jointure, &s;o by the Duke of <HI>Gloce&s;ter</HI>'s death, the charge on it was now le&s;s than when it was grant|ed; &s;o they took almo&s;t four thou&s;and pounds a Week out of the Exci&s;e, and, upon an A&s;&s;ignation made of that for &s;ome years, a great &s;um was rai&s;ed; This, was very &s;en&s;ible to the Court, and the new Mini&s;ters found it no ea&s;y thing to main|tain, at the &s;ame time, their Intere&s;t both with the King and their Party: This matter was at la&s;t yielded to by the King. All the remainder of this Se&s;&s;ion relates to the Impeachments.</P>
<P>The Lords had re&s;olved to begin with the Trial of the Earl <NOTE PLACE="marg">Me&s;&s;ages pa&s;t between the Two Hou&s;es.</NOTE> of <HI>Orford;</HI> becau&s;e the Articles again&s;t him were the fir&s;t that were brought up; and &s;ince the Commons made no Replica|tion, the Lords, according to clear Precedents, named a day for his Trial, and gave notice of it to the Hou&s;e of Commons: Upon this, th&eacute; Commons moved the Lords, to agree to name a Committee of both Hou&s;es for &s;ettling the Preliminaries of the Trial, and they named two Preliminaries; One was, that the Lord who was to be tried, &s;hould not &s;it as a Peer; the other was, that tho&s;e Lords, who were impeached for the &s;ame matter, might not vote in the Trial of one another: They al|&s;o acquainted the Lords, that the cour&s;e of their Evidence led them to begin with the Lord <HI>Somers.</HI> The Lords judged their
<PB N="277" REF="298">
la&s;t demand rea&s;onable, and agreed to it; but di&s;agreed to the others. They con&s;idered them&s;elves as a Court of Ju&s;tice, and how great &s;oever the regard due to the Hou&s;e of Commons might be, in all other re&s;pects, yet in matters of Ju&s;tice, where they were the Accu&s;ers, they could only be con&s;idered as Par|ties. The King, when he had a Suit with a Subject, &s;ubmit|ted to the equality of Ju&s;tice; So the Commons ought to pre|tend to no advantage over a &s;ingle per&s;on, in a Trial; A Court of Ju&s;tice ought to hear the demands of both Parties pleaded fairly, and then to judge impartially; A Committee named by one of the Parties, to &s;it in an equality with the Judges, and to &s;ettle matters relating to the Trial, was a thing practi&s;ed in no Court or Nation, and &s;eemed contrary to the principles of Law or rules of Ju&s;tice: By the&s;e means, they could at lea&s;t delay Trials, as long as they plea&s;ed, and all delays of ju&s;tice are real and great inju&s;tices. This had never been demanded but once, in the ca&s;e of the Popi&s;h Plot; then it was often re|fu&s;ed; it is true, it was at la&s;t yielded to by the Lords, tho' with great oppo&s;ition; That was a ca&s;e of Trea&s;on, in which the King's Life and the Safety of the Nation was concerned; There was then a great jealou&s;y of the Court, and of the Lords that belonged to it; and the Nation was in &s;o great a fer|ment, that the Lords might at that time yield to &s;uch a motion, tho' it derogated from their Judicature: That ought not to be &s;et up for a precedent for a quiet time, and in a ca&s;e pretend|ed to be no more than a Mi&s;demeanor; So the Lords re|&s;olved not to admit of this, but to hear what&s;oever &s;hould be propo&s;ed by the Commons, and to give them all ju&s;t and rea|&s;onable &s;atisfaction in it. The chief point in que&s;tion, in the year 1679, was, how far the Bi&s;hops might &s;it and vote in Trials of Trea&s;on; but without all di&s;pute, they were to vote in Trials for Mi&s;demeanors; It was al&s;o &s;ettled in the ca&s;e of the Lord <HI>Mordaunt,</HI> that a Lord tried for a Mi&s;demeanor was to &s;it within the Bar; In all other Courts, men tried for &s;uch Offences came within the Bar; This was &s;tronger in the ca&s;e of a Peer, who by his Patent had a Seat in that Hou&s;e, from which nothing but a judgment of the Hou&s;e, for &s;ome offence, could remove him: They indeed found that, in King <HI>James</HI> the Fir&s;t's time, the Earl of <HI>Middle&s;ex,</HI> being accu&s;ed of Mi&s;de|meanors, was brought to the Bar; But as that pro&s;ecution was violent, &s;o there had been no later precedent of that kind, to govern proceedings by it: There had been many &s;ince that time, and it had been &s;ettled, as a rule for future times, that Peers tried for &s;uch Offences were to &s;it within the Bar. The
<PB N="278" REF="299">
other Preliminary was, that Peers accu&s;ed for the &s;ame Offence, might not vote in the Trials of the others: The Lords found that a right of voting was &s;o inherent in every Peer in all cau&s;es, except where him&s;elf was a Party, that it could not be taken from him, but by a &s;entence of the Hou&s;e; a Vote of the Hou&s;e could not deprive him of it; Otherwi&s;e, a Majority might up|on any pretence deny &s;ome Peers their right of voting, and the Commons, by impeaching many Peers at once, for the &s;ame offence, might exclude as many Lords as they plea&s;ed from judging: It was al&s;o ob&s;erved, that a man might be a judge in any cau&s;e, in which he might be a Witne&s;s; And it was a common practice to bring per&s;ons, charged with the &s;ame of|fence, if they were not in the &s;ame Indictment, to witne&s;s the facts, with which they them&s;elves were charged, in another In|dictment: and a parity of rea&s;on appeared in the ca&s;e of Lords, who were charged in different Impeachments, for the &s;ame facts, that they might be judges in one another's Trials. Upon the&s;e points, many Me&s;&s;ages pa&s;&s;ed between the Two Hou&s;es, with &s;o much precipitation, that it was not ea&s;y to di&s;tingui&s;h, between the An&s;wers and the Replies: The Commons &s;till kept off the Trial, by affected delays; It was vi&s;ible, that when a Trial &s;hould come on, they had nothing to charge the&s;e Lords with: So the Leaders of the Party &s;hewed their skill, in find|ing out excu&s;es, to keep up the clamour, and to hinder the matters from being brought to an i&s;&s;ue: The main point, that was &s;till in&s;i&s;ted on, was a Committee of both Hou&s;es, &s;o ac|cording to the forms of the Hou&s;e, it was brought to a free Conference.</P>
<P>In it, the Lord <HI>Haver&s;ham,</HI> &s;peaking to the point of Lords being partial in their own ca&s;es and therefore not proper judges, &s;aid that the Hou&s;e of Commons had plainly &s;hewed their par|tiality, in impeaching &s;ome Lords for facts, in which others were equally concerned with them, who yet were not impeached by them, tho' they were &s;till in credit and about the King; which &s;hewed, that they thought neither the one nor the other were Guilty. The Commons thought, they had now found an occa&s;ion of quarrelling with the Lords, which they were looking for; So they immediately withdrew from the Confe|rence, tho' they were told that the Lord <HI>Haver&s;ham</HI> &s;poke only his own private &s;en&s;e, and not by any direction from the Hou&s;e. The Hou&s;e of Commons &s;ent up a Complaint to the Lords, of this Reflection on their Proceedings, as an indignity done them, for which they expected Reparation; Upon this, the Lord <HI>Haver&s;ham</HI> offered him&s;elf to a Trial, and &s;ubmitted to any
<PB N="279" REF="300">
Cen&s;ure, that the Lords &s;hould think he had de&s;erved; but in&s;i&s;ted that the words mu&s;t fir&s;t be proved, and he mu&s;t be allowed to put his own &s;en&s;e on them; The Lords &s;ent this to the Commons, but they &s;eemed to think that the Lords ought to have proceeded to cen&s;ure him in a &s;ummary way, which the Lords thought, being a Court of Judicature, they could not do, till the words were proved, and the importance of them di&s;cu&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of Commons had now got a pretence to ju&s;tify <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lords tried and acquitted.</NOTE> their not going further in the&s;e Trials; and they re&s;olved to in&s;i&s;t upon it: They &s;aid, they could expect no ju&s;tice, and therefore they could not go on with the pro&s;ecutions of their Impeachments; And a day being &s;et for the Lord <HI>Somers</HI>'s Tri|al, they excepting &s;till, it was put off for &s;ome time, at la&s;t a peremptory day was fixed for it; But the Commons refu&s;ed to appear, and &s;aid they were the only Judges, when they were ready with their Evidence, and that it was a mockery, to go to a Trial, when they were not ready to appear at it. There were great and long Debates upon this in the Hou&s;e of Lords; The new Mini&s;try, and all the Jacobites joined to &s;upport the preten&s;ions of the Commons: every &s;tep was to be made by a Vote, again&s;t which many Lords prote&s;ted, and the rea&s;ons given, in &s;ome of their prote&s;tations, were thought to be &s;o in|jurious to the Hou&s;e, that they were by a Vote ordered to be expunged, a thing that &s;eldom happens. When the day &s;et for the Trial came, the other Lords, who were al&s;o impeached, asked the leave of the Hou&s;e to withdraw, and not to &s;it and vote in it; This was granted them, tho' it was much oppo&s;ed and prote&s;ted again&s;t by the Tory Party, becau&s;e the giving &s;uch leave, &s;uppo&s;ed that they had a right to vote: The Lords went down in Form to <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall,</HI> where the Articles again&s;t the Lord <HI>Somers</HI> were fir&s;t read; Lord <HI>Somers</HI>'s An&s;wers were next read; and none appearing to make good the charge, the Lords came back to their Hou&s;e, where they had a long and warm Debate of many hours, concerning the Que&s;tion that was to be put; The Judges told them, that, according to the Forms of Law, it ought to be <HI>Guilty,</HI> or <HI>not Guilty:</HI> But tho&s;e of the Party &s;aid, as it was certain, that none could vote him Guilty, &s;o &s;ince the Hou&s;e of Commons had not come to make good the charge, they could not vote him not Guilty; &s;o to give them &s;ome content, the Que&s;tion, agreed on to be put, was, whether he ought to be acquitted of the Impeachment or not? That being &s;ettled, the Lords went again to the Hall, and the que&s;tion being put, fifty &s;ix voted in the Affirmative, and thirty one in the Negative. Upon this, the Hou&s;e of Com|mons
<PB N="280" REF="301">
pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome high Votes again&s;t the Lords, as having de|nied them ju&s;tice, and having ob&s;tructed the publick proceed|ings; and called the Trial a pretended Trial. The Lords went as high in their Votes again&s;t the Commons; and each Hou&s;e ordered a Narrative of the proceedings to be publi&s;hed, for &s;atisfying the Nation; A few days after this, the Earl of <HI>Orford</HI>'s Trial came on, but all the Lords of the other &s;ide withdrawing, there was no di&s;pute; So he was acquitted by an unanimous Vote. The Lords did al&s;o acquit both the Earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Halifax;</HI> and becau&s;e the Commons had never in&s;i&s;ted on their pro&s;ecution of the Duke of <HI>Leeds,</HI> which they had begun &s;ome years before, they likewi&s;e acquit|ted him, and &s;o this contentious Se&s;&s;ion came to an end. The Two Hou&s;es had gone &s;o far in their Votes again&s;t one another, that it was believed they would never meet again; The pro|ceedings of the Lords had the general approbation of the Na|tion on their &s;ide; Mo&s;t of the Bi&s;hops adhered to the impeach|ed Lords, and their behaviour on this occa&s;ion was much com|mended; I bore &s;ome &s;hare in tho&s;e Debates, perhaps more than became me, con&s;idering my &s;tation and other circum|&s;tances; But as I was convinced of the innocence of the Lords, &s;o I thought the Government it&s;elf was &s;truck at, and there|fore when I apprehended all was in danger, I was willing to venture every thing in &s;uch a quarrel; The violence, as well as the folly of the Party, lo&s;t them much ground, with all in|different men; but with none more, than with the King him|&s;elf; who found his error, in changing his Mini&s;try at &s;o criti|cal a time; and he now &s;aw, that the Tories were at heart irre|concilable to him: in particular, he was extream unea&s;y with the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> of who&s;e imperious and intractable tem|per, he complained much, and &s;eemed re&s;olved to di&s;engage him&s;elf quickly from him, and never to return to him any more. He thought the Party was neither &s;olid nor &s;incere, and that they were actuated by pa&s;&s;ion and revenge, without any views with relation to our quiet at home, or to our affairs abroad.</P>
<P>But having now given an account of the Se&s;&s;ion of Parlia|ment, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Convoca|tion of the Clergy men.</NOTE> I turn to another &s;cene: When the new Mini&s;try under|took to &s;erve the King, one of their Demands was, that a Con|vocation &s;hould have leave to &s;it, which was promi&s;ed, and it &s;ate this Winter; Dr. <HI>Atterbury</HI>'s Book, concerning the Rights of a Convocation, was reprinted with great Corrections and Ad|ditions; The fir&s;t Edition was drawn out of &s;ome imperfect and di&s;orderly Collections, and he him&s;elf &s;oon &s;aw that, not|with&s;tanding
<PB N="281" REF="302">
the a&s;&s;urance and the virulence with which it was writ, he had made many great mi&s;takes in it; So, to pre|vent a di&s;covery from other hands, he corrected his Book, in many important matters; Yet he left a great deal to tho&s;e who an&s;wered him, and did it with &s;uch a &s;uperiority of Argument and of Knowledge in the&s;e matters, that his in&s;olence in de&s;pi&s;ing the&s;e An&s;wers, was as extraordinary, as the Parties adhering to him after &s;uch manife&s;t di&s;coveries. Dr. <HI>Kennet</HI> laid him &s;o open, not only in many particulars, but in a thread of igno|rance that ran thro' his whole Book, that if he had not had a mea&s;ure of confidence peculiar to him&s;elf; he mu&s;t have been much humbled under it. The Clergy hoped to recover many lo&s;t Privileges, by the help of his performances; They fancied they had a right to be a part of the Parliament, &s;o they look|ed on him as their Champion, and on mo&s;t of the Bi&s;hops, as the Betrayers of the Rights of the Church: This was encourag|ed by the new Mini&s;try; They were di&s;plea&s;ed with the Bi|&s;hops, for adhering to the old Mini&s;try; and they hoped, by the Terror of a Convocation, to have forced them to apply to them for &s;helter. The Jacobites intended to put us all in &s;uch a flame, as they hoped would di&s;order the Government. The things the Convocation pretended to, were fir&s;t, that they had a right to &s;it when&s;oever the Parliament &s;ate; So that they could not be prorogued, but when the Two Hou&s;es were pro|rogued: Next they advanced, that they had no need of a Licence to enter upon Debates, and to prepare matters, tho' it was con|fe&s;&s;ed, that the Practice for an hundred years was again&s;t them; But they thought the Convocation lay under no farther re&s;traint, than that the Parliament was under; and as they could pa&s;s no Act without the Royal A&s;&s;ent; &s;o they confe&s;&s;ed that they could not enact or publi&s;h a Canon without the King's Li|cen&s;e. Antiently the Clergy granted their own Sub&s;idies apart, but ever &s;ince the Reformation, the Grant of the Convocation was not thought good, till it was ratified in Parliament; But the Rule of Sub&s;idies being &s;o high on the Clergy, they had &s;ubmitted to be taxed by the Hou&s;e of Commons, ever &s;ince the year 1665, tho' no Memorials were left to inform us, how that matter was con&s;ented to &s;o generally, that no oppo&s;ition of any &s;ort was made to it; The giving of Money being yield|ed up, which was the chief bu&s;ine&s;s of Convocations, they had after that nothing to do; &s;o they &s;ate only for Form's &s;ake, and were adjourned of cour&s;e; nor did they ever pretend, not|with&s;tanding all the danger that Religion was in during the for|mer Reigns, to &s;it and act as a Synod; but now this was de|manded
<PB N="282" REF="303">
as a Right, and they complained of their being &s;o often prorogued, as a violation of their Con&s;titution, for which all the Bi&s;hops, but more particularly the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> was cried out on; They &s;aid, that he and the Bi&s;hops looked &s;o much to their own Intere&s;ts, that they forgot the Intere&s;ts of the Church, or rather betrayed them: The greater part of the Clergy were in no good temper: they hated the Toleration, and were heavily charged with the Taxes, which made them very unea&s;y; and this di&s;po&s;ed them to be &s;oon inflamed by tho&s;e, who were &s;eeking out all po&s;&s;ible methods to di&s;order our affairs: They hoped to have engaged them again&s;t the Suprema|cy, and reckoned, that in the feeble &s;tate to which the Go|vernment was now brought, they might hope either to wre&s;t it quite from the Crown, and then it would fall into the Ma|nagement of the Hou&s;e of Commons; Or if the King &s;hould proceed again&s;t them according to the Statute, and &s;ue them in a Premunire, this might unite the Clergy into &s;uch an op|po&s;ition to the Government, as would probably throw us into great Convul&s;ions: But many a&s;piring men among them, had no other de&s;ign, but to force them&s;elves into Preferment, by the oppo&s;ition they made. In the Writ that the Bi&s;hops had, &s;ummoning them to Parliament, the Clau&s;e, known by the fir&s;t word of it <HI>Premunientes,</HI> was &s;till continued: at fir&s;t, by virtue of it, the inferior Clergy were required to come to Parliament, and to con&s;ent to the Aids there given: But after the Archbi&s;hops had the provincial Writ, for a Convocation of the Province, the other was no more executed, tho' it was &s;till kept in the Writ, and there did not appear the lea&s;t &s;hadow of any u&s;e that had been made of it, for &s;ome hundreds of years; yet now &s;ome Bi&s;hops were prevailed on, to execute this Clau&s;e, and to Summon the Clergy by virtue of it: The Con|vocation was opened with Speeches, full of &s;harp Reflections on the Bi&s;hops, which they pa&s;t over, being unwilling to begin a Di&s;pute.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Hooper,</HI> Dean of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> was cho&s;en Prolocutor, a man of Learning and good conduct hitherto; he was re&s;erved, <NOTE PLACE="marg">They di&s;|pute the Archbi|&s;hop's Pow|er of ad|journing them.</NOTE> crafty and ambitious; his Deanery had not &s;often'd him, for he thought he de&s;erved to be rai&s;ed higher. The con&s;tant method of Adjournments had been this; the Archbi&s;hop &s;igned a Schedule for that purpo&s;e, by which the Upper Hou&s;e was immediately adjourned, and that being &s;ent down to the Prolocutor, did al|&s;o adjourn the Lower Hou&s;e: The Clergy perceiving that, by this means, the Archbi&s;hop could adjourn them at plea&s;ure, and either hinder or break off all Debates, re&s;olved to begin at

di&s;puting this point; and they brought a Paper to the Upper Hou&s;e, in which they a&s;&s;erted their right of Adjourning them|&s;elves, and cited &s;ome Precedents for it; To this, the Bi&s;hops drew a very copious an&s;wer, in which all their Precedents were examined and an&s;wered, and the matter was &s;o clearly &s;tated, and &s;o fully proved, that we hoped we had put an end to the Di&s;pute: The Lower Hou&s;e &s;ate for &s;ome time about the Re|ply to this; but in&s;tead of going on with that, they de&s;ired a free Conference: and began to affect, in all their Proceedings, to follow the methods of the Hou&s;e of Commons: The Bi&s;hops re&s;olved not to comply with this, which was wholly new: They had, upon &s;ome occa&s;ions, called up the Lower Hou&s;e to a Conference, in order to the explaining &s;ome things to them: But the Clergy had never taken upon them, to de&s;ire a Con|ference with the Bi&s;hops before; So they re&s;olved not to admit of it, and told them, they expected an An&s;wer to the Paper they had &s;ent them: The Lower Hou&s;e re&s;olved not to comply with this, but on the contrary, to take no more notice of the Archbi&s;hop's Adjournments: They did indeed ob&s;erve the rule of adjourning them&s;elves to the day, which the Archbi&s;hop had appointed in his Schedule, but they did it as their own Act, and they adjourned them&s;elves to intermediate days.</P>
<P>That they might expre&s;s a zeal in the matters of Religion, <NOTE PLACE="marg">They Cen|&s;ure Books.</NOTE> they re&s;olved to proceed again&s;t &s;ome bad Books; They began with one, entitled <HI>Chri&s;tianity not My&s;terious,</HI> wrote by one <HI>To|land,</HI> a man of a bold and petulant wit, who pa&s;&s;ed for a <HI>So|cinian,</HI> but was believed to be a man of no Religion: They drew &s;ome propo&s;itions out of this Book, but did it with &s;o lit|tle judgment, that they pa&s;&s;ed over the wor&s;t, that were in it, and &s;ingled out &s;ome, that how ill &s;oever they were meant, yet were capable of a good &s;en&s;e: They brought up the Cen&s;ure, that they had pa&s;t on this Book, to the Bi&s;hops, and de&s;ired them to agree to their Re&s;olutions: This &s;truck &s;o directly at the Epi&s;copal Authority, that it &s;eemed &s;trange to &s;ee men, who had &s;o long a&s;&s;erted the Divine Right of Epi&s;copacy, and that Presbyters were only their A&s;&s;i&s;tants and Council (according to the Language of all Antiquity) now a&s;&s;ume to them&s;elves the mo&s;t important Act of Church Government, the judging in Points of Doctrine: In this it appeared, how &s;oon mens Inte|re&s;ts and Pa&s;&s;ions can run them from one extreme to another: The Bi&s;hops &s;aw, that their de&s;ign in this was only to gain &s;ome credit to them&s;elves, by this &s;hew of zeal for the great Articles of Religion; So they took advice of men learned in the Law, how far the Act of Submi&s;&s;ion in the twenty fifth of <HI>Henry</HI> the
<PB N="284" REF="305">
Eighth did re&s;train them in this ca&s;e. There had been the like complaint made in the Convocation 1698, of many ill Books then publi&s;hed; and the Bi&s;hops had then advi&s;ed both with Civilians and Common Lawyers in this matter: They were an|&s;wered, that every Bi&s;hop might proceed in his own Court, again&s;t the Authors or Spreaders of ill Books, within his Dioce&s;e: But they did not know of any Power the Convocation had to do it: it did not &s;o much as appear, that they could &s;ummon any to come before them: And when a Book was publi&s;hed, with the Author's Name to it, the condemning it, without hearing the Author upon it, &s;eemed contrary to the common rules of Ju&s;tice. It did not &s;eem to be a Court at all, and &s;ince no Appeal lay from it, it certainly could not be a Court, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance. When this Que&s;tion was now again put to Lawyers, &s;ome were afraid, and others were unwilling to an&s;wer it: But Sir <HI>Edward Northey,</HI> afterwards made Attor|ney General, thought the condemning Books was a thing of great con&s;equence; &s;ince the Doctrine of the Church might be altered, by condemning Explanations of one &s;ort, and allowing tho&s;e of another; and &s;ince the Convocation had no Licence from the King, he thought that, by meddling in that matter, they &s;hould incur the Pains in the Statute: &s;o all further De|bate of this matter was let fall by the Bi&s;hops. The Lower Hou&s;e going on, to &s;it in intermediate days, many of the mo&s;t eminent and learned among them, not only refu&s;ed to &s;it with them on tho&s;e days, but thought it was incumbent on them, to pro|te&s;t again&s;t their Proceedings; but the Lower Hou&s;e refu&s;ing to &s;uffer this to be enter'd in their Books, they &s;ignified it in a Petition to the Archbi&s;hop. The Party &s;itting alone, in tho&s;e intermediate days; they enter'd into &s;uch a &s;ecrecy, that it could not be known what they &s;ate &s;o clo&s;e upon: So the Arch|bi&s;hop appointed five Bi&s;hops, together with ten they &s;hould name, as a Committee to examine their Books; But tho' this had been often done, yet, upon this occa&s;ion, the Lower Hou&s;e refu&s;ed to comply with it, or to name a Committee: This was &s;uch an unprecedented inva&s;ion of the Epi&s;copal Authori|ty, that the Upper Hou&s;e re&s;olved to receive nothing from them, till that irregularity was &s;et right.</P>
<P>Hereupon they, being highly incen&s;ed again&s;t me, cen&s;ured <NOTE PLACE="marg">And com|plain of my Expo&s;ition.</NOTE> my Expo&s;ition of the Articles, which, in imitation of the Gene|ral Impeachments by the Hou&s;e of Commons, they put in three General Propo&s;itions: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That it allowed a diver&s;ity of Opinions, which the Articles were framed to avoid. <HI>Secondly,</HI> That it contained many Pa&s;&s;ages contrary to the true mean|ing
<PB N="285" REF="306">
of the Articles, and to other received Doctrines of our Church. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> That &s;ome things in it were of dangerous con&s;equence to the Church, and derogated from the honour of the Reformation. What the particulars, to which the&s;e gene|ral Heads referred, were, could never be learned; this was a Secret lodged in confiding hands: I begg'd, that the Archbi|&s;hop would di&s;pen&s;e with the Order made, again&s;t further com|munication with the Lower Hou&s;e, as to this matter: But they would enter into no particulars, unle&s;s they might at the &s;ame time offer &s;ome other matters, which the Bi&s;hops would not admit of.</P>
<P>In the&s;e Proceedings the Bi&s;hops were unanimous, except the Bi&s;hops of <HI>London, Roche&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Exeter:</HI> The Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI> had been twice di&s;appointed of his hopes, of being ad|vanced to the See of <HI>Canterbury;</HI> &s;o for &s;everal years he was engaged with the Tory Party, and oppo&s;ed the Court in eve|ry thing, but with little force or authority: The Bi&s;hop of <HI>Ro|che&s;ter</HI> had been deeply engaged in the former Reigns, and he &s;tuck firm to the Party, to which, by rea&s;on of the liberties of his Life, he brought no &s;ort of honour. The&s;e Bi&s;hops gave no great reputation to the proceedings of the Lower Hou&s;e, to which they adhered; They likewi&s;e enter'd their Di&s;&s;ent to the Re&s;olutions taken in the Upper Hou&s;e. From the fire rai&s;ed thus in Convocation, a great heat was &s;pread thro' the whole Clergy of the Kingdom: it alienated them from their Bi&s;hops, and rai&s;ed Factions among them every where.</P>
<P>Thus ended the Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament and Convocation, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King was &s;till re|&s;erved.</NOTE> which had the wor&s;t a&s;pect of any, that had &s;ate during this Reign. The new Mini&s;ters pre&s;&s;ed the King often to di&s;&s;olve the Commi&s;&s;ion, that recommended to Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Prefer|ments, and to turn out &s;ome of the Whigs, who were in Im|ployments, the Lord <HI>Haver&s;ham</HI> in particular, who was in the Admiralty: But the King could not be prevailed on to do any thing, yet he kept him&s;elf &s;o much on the re&s;erve, that when he went out of <HI>England,</HI> it was not certainly known, whether he intended to di&s;&s;olve the Parliament or not. When the King came to the <HI>Hague,</HI> he found the Negotiation with <HI>France</HI> quite at an end: the King of <HI>France</HI> had recalled his Mini&s;ter; The <HI>States</HI> had encrea&s;ed their Force, and the <HI>French</HI> were very &s;trong in their Neighbourhood: So that though no War was ac|tually declared, yet it was very near breaking out.</P>
<P>The Emperor's Army was now got into <HI>Italy:</HI> The entrance <NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince <HI>Fu|gene</HI> march|ed into <HI>Ita|ly.</HI></NOTE> towards <HI>Verona</HI> was &s;topt by the <HI>French;</HI> but Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> came in by <HI>Vincenza;</HI> and when the Reinforcements and Artil|lery

came up to him, he made a feint of pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Po</HI> near <HI>Ferrara;</HI> and having thus amu&s;ed the <HI>French,</HI> he pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Adige</HI> near <HI>Carpi,</HI> where a Body of five thou&s;and <HI>French</HI> lay: the&s;e he routed, &s;o the <HI>French</HI> retired to the <HI>Mincio:</HI> He fol|lowed them, and pa&s;&s;ed that River in their &s;ight, without any oppo&s;ition: The <HI>French</HI> Army was commanded by the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> with him were the Mare&s;chal <HI>Catinat,</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Vaudemont,</HI> Governor of <HI>Milan:</HI> The&s;e differed in opinion, the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> was for fighting; <HI>Catinat</HI> and Prince <HI>Vaudemont</HI> were again&s;t it: So the Mare&s;chal <HI>Villeroy</HI> was &s;ent thither, with Or|ders to fight. <HI>Catinat,</HI> who was the be&s;t General the <HI>French</HI> had left, looking on this as a Di&s;grace, retired and langui&s;hed for &s;ome time; yet he recovered. There were many &s;mall engagements of Parties &s;ent out on both &s;ides, in which the <HI>Germans</HI> had always the better: yet this did not di&s;courage <HI>Villeroy,</HI> from ventur|ing to attack them in their Camp at <HI>Chiari:</HI> but they were &s;o well entrenched, and defended them&s;elves with &s;o much re&s;o|lution, that the <HI>French</HI> were forced to draw off with great lo&s;s: about five thou&s;and of them were killed, whereas the lo&s;s of the <HI>Germans</HI> was incon&s;iderable. Sickne&s;s likewi&s;e broke in upon the <HI>French,</HI> &s;o that their Army was much dimini&s;hed; and after this, they were not in a condition to undertake any thing. Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> lay for &s;ome time in his Camp at <HI>Chiari,</HI> &s;ending out Parties as far as the <HI>Adda,</HI> who meeting oft with Parties of the <HI>French,</HI> had always the advantage, killing &s;ome, and taking ma|ny Pri&s;oners: For &s;everal Months, Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> had no place of defence to retire to; his Camp was all; &s;o that a blow given him there, mu&s;t have ruined his whole Army: towards the end of the Campaign, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of all the <HI>Mantuan</HI> Territo|ry, except <HI>Mantua</HI> and <HI>Goits:</HI> he blockt them both up; and when the Sea&s;on obliged the <HI>French</HI> to go into Quarters, he took all the Places on the <HI>Oglio,</HI> and continued in motion the whole following Winter. The <HI>French</HI> had no other Enemy to deal with, &s;o they poured in their whole force upon him: He was then but a young man, and had little a&s;&s;i&s;tance from tho&s;e about him, and none at all during the Summer from the Princes and States of <HI>Italy:</HI> For the Pope and the <HI>Venetians</HI> pretend|ed to maintain a Neutrality, tho' upon many occa&s;ions, the Pope &s;hewed great partiality to the <HI>French:</HI> The People indeed favoured him, &s;o that he had good and &s;ea&s;onable Intelligence brought him of all the motions of the <HI>French:</HI> and in his whole Conduct, he &s;hewed both a depth of contrivance, and an exactne&s;s in execution, with all the courage, but without any of the ra&s;hne&s;s of youth.</P>

But to carry on the &s;eries of his motions as far as this period of my Hi&s;tory goes, his attempt in <HI>January</HI> following upon <HI>Cremona,</HI> had almo&s;t proved a deci&s;ive one.

But the other Body did not come up critically, at the time appointed: So an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Regiment &s;ecured the Bridge: And thus the De&s;ign, that was &s;o well contrived, and &s;o happily executed in one part, did fail. Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> had but four thou&s;and Men with him, &s;o that &s;ince the other Body could not join him, he was forced to march back, which he did without any con&s;ide|rable lo&s;s, carrying Mare&s;chal <HI>Villeroy</HI> and &s;ome other Pri&s;oners with him. In this attempt, tho' he had not an entire Succe&s;s, yet he gained all the Glory, to which the ambition of a Military Man could a&s;pire, &s;o that he was looked on as the greate&s;t and happie&s;t General of the Age: He went on enlarging his Quar|ters, &s;ecuring all his Po&s;ts, and &s;traitning the Blockade of <HI>Man|tua,</HI> and was in perpetual motion during the whole Winter: The <HI>French</HI> were &s;truck with this ill &s;ucce&s;s; More Troops were &s;ent into <HI>Italy,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Vendome</HI> went to command the Armies there.</P>

This took up &s;ome time, and occa&s;ioned many di&s;putes: all was &s;ettled at la&s;t: But their Grant was &s;hort of what was ex|pected, and did not defray the charges of the King's &s;tay in the place. A great di&s;po&s;ition to revolt appeared in the King|dom of <HI>Naples,</HI> and it broke out in &s;ome feeble attempts, that were &s;oon ma&s;tered, the Leaders of the&s;e were taken and exe|cuted: They ju&s;tified them&s;elves by this Apology, that till the Pope granted the Inve&s;titure, they could not be bound to obey the new King: The Duke of <HI>Medina</HI> was a &s;evere Governor, hoth on his Ma&s;ter's account and on his own: Some of the <HI>Au&s;trian</HI> Party made their e&s;cape to <HI>Rome</HI> and to <HI>Vienna:</HI> They repre&s;ented to the Emperor, that the di&s;po&s;ition of the Coun|try was &s;uch, in his favour, that a &s;mall Force of ten thou&s;and Men, would certainly put that Kingdom wholly into his hands. Orders were upon that &s;ent to Prince <HI>Eugene,</HI> to &s;end a Detachment into the Kingdom of <HI>Naples:</HI> But tho' he believed, a &s;mall Force would &s;oon reduce that Kingdom, yet he judged that &s;uch a diminution of his own &s;trength, when the <HI>French</HI> were &s;ending &s;o many Troops into the <HI>Milaneze,</HI> would &s;o expo&s;e him, that it would not be po&s;&s;ible to maintain a defen|&s;ive, with &s;uch an unequal Force: Yet repeated Orders came to him to the &s;ame effect; but in oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e, he made &s;uch repre&s;entations, that at la&s;t it was left to him&s;elf, to do what he found &s;afe&s;t and mo&s;t for the Emperor's Service; with that the matter was let fall, and it &s;oon appeared, that he had judged better than the Court of <HI>Vienna:</HI> but this was, by his Enemies, imputed to humour and ob&s;tinacy: So that for &s;ome time after that, he was neither con&s;idered nor &s;upported, as his great Services had de&s;erved. This might flow from envy and malice, which are the ordinary growth of all Courts, chiefly of feeble ones: Or it might be a practice of the <HI>French,</HI> who had corrupt|ed mo&s;t Courts, and that of <HI>Vienna</HI> in particular; &s;ince nothing could more advance their ends, than to alienate the Emperor from Prince <HI>Eugene;</HI> which might &s;o far di&s;gu&s;t him, as to make him more remi&s;s in his Service.</P>

<P>This was the &s;tate of the Affairs of <HI>Europe</HI> this Summer. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Several Ne|gotiations.</NOTE> Several Negotiations were &s;ecretly carried on; The Elector of <HI>Cologn</HI> was entirely gained to the <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;t, but was re|&s;olved not to declare him&s;elf, till his Brother thought fit likewi&s;e to do it: All the progre&s;s that the <HI>French</HI> made with the two Brothers this Summer, was, that they declared for a Neutrality, and again&s;t a War with <HI>France:</HI> The Dukes of <HI>Wolfembuttle</HI> and <HI>Saxe Gotha,</HI> were al&s;o engaged in the &s;ame de&s;ign; They made great Levies of Troops, beyond what they them|&s;elves could pay, for which it was vi&s;ible that they were &s;up|plied from <HI>France:</HI> Here was a formidable appearance of great di&s;tractions in the Empire. An Alliance was al&s;o projected with the King of <HI>Portugal:</HI> His Mini&s;ters were in the <HI>French</HI> In|tere&s;ts, but he him&s;elf inclined to the <HI>Au&s;trian</HI> Family: He for &s;ome time affected Retirement, and avoided the giving Audi|ence to Foreign Mini&s;ters: He &s;aw no good pro&s;pect from <HI>Eng|land;</HI> So being pre&s;&s;ed to an Alliance with <HI>France,</HI> his Mini&s;ters got leave from him to propo&s;e one, on terms of &s;uch advantage to him, that as it was not expected they could be granted; &s;o it was hoped this would run into a long Negotiation: But the <HI>French</HI> were as liberal in making large promi&s;es, as they were perfidious in not ob&s;erving them: So the King of <HI>France</HI> agreed to all that was propo&s;ed, and &s;igned a Treaty pur&s;uant to it, and publi&s;hed it to the World; Yet the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> de|nied that he had con&s;ented to any &s;uch Project: and he was &s;o hardly brought to &s;ign the Treaty, that when it was brought to

him, he threw it down, and kickt it about the Room, as our Envoy wrote over: In conclu&s;ion however, he was prevailed on to &s;ign it: But it was generally thought, that when he &s;hould &s;ee a good Fleet come from the Allies, he would ob&s;erve this Treaty with the <HI>French,</HI> as they have done their Treaties with all the re&s;t of the World. <HI>Spain</HI> grew unea&s;y and di&s;content|ed under a <HI>French</HI> Management: The Grandees were little con|&s;idered, and they &s;aw great de&s;igns, for the better conduct of the Revenues of the Crown, likely to take place every where, which were very unacceptable to them, who minded nothing &s;o much as to keep up a va&s;t Magnificence, at the King's Co&s;t. They &s;aw them&s;elves much de&s;pi&s;ed by their new Ma&s;ters, as there was indeed great cau&s;e for it; They had too much pride to bear this well, and too little courage to think how they &s;hould &s;hake it off.</P>
<P>But now to return to our Affairs at home, the Duke of <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parlia|ment in <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Queensbury</HI> was &s;ent down to hold a Parliament in <HI>Scotland;</HI> where people were in &s;o bad a humour, that much practice was nece&s;&s;ary to bring them into any temper. They pa&s;&s;ed many angry Votes upon the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Darien,</HI> but in conclu&s;ion the Se&s;&s;ion ended well. The Army was reduced one half, and the Troops that were ordered to be broke, were &s;ent to the <HI>States,</HI> who were now encrea&s;ing their Force: This Se&s;&s;ion was chiefly managed by the Duke of <HI>Queensbury</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Argyle,</HI> and in reward for it, the one had the Garter, and the other was made a Duke.</P>
<P>In <HI>Ireland,</HI> the Tru&s;tees went on to hear the Claims of the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> and in many ca&s;es, they gave judgment in their favour: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in <HI>Ireland.</HI></NOTE> But now it began to appear, that whereas it had been given out, that the Sale of the confi&s;cated E&s;tates would amount to a Million and a half, it was not like to ri&s;e to the third part of that Sum: In the mean while, the Tru&s;tees lived in great State there, and were Ma&s;ters of all the Affairs of that King|dom: But no propo&s;itions were yet made for the purcha|&s;ing of tho&s;e E&s;tates: During the King's ab&s;ence, the Nation was in a great ferment, which was increa&s;ed by many Books that were wrote, to expo&s;e the late Management in the Hou&s;e of Commons, and the new Mini&s;try, the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> in particular, who was thought the driver of all violent motions: The few Books that were publi&s;hed, on the other &s;ide, were &s;o poorly writ, that it tempted one to think, they were writ by men who per&s;onated the being on their &s;ide, on de&s;ign to ex|po&s;e them. The Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> delayed his going to <HI>Ireland</HI>

very long: He perceived that the King's heart was not with him, and was very unea&s;y at that: as on the other hand, the King complained much of his intractable temper and imperious manner, and by his intercour&s;e with him, the King came to &s;ee that he was not the man he had taken him for; that he had no great nor clear notions of Affairs abroad, and that, in&s;tead of moderating the violence of his Party, he inflamed them; &s;o that he often &s;aid, that the year, in which he directed the Coun|cils, was one of the unea&s;ie&s;t of his whole Life. The Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> finding the King's coldne&s;s towards him, expo&s;tulated with him upon it, and &s;aid, he could &s;erve him no longer, &s;ince he &s;aw he did not tru&s;t him. The King heard this with his u&s;ual flegm, and concluded upon it, that he &s;hould &s;ee him no more: But <HI>Harley</HI> made him a little more &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and to|wardly. After the King was gone beyond Sea, he al&s;o went into <HI>Ireland,</HI> there he u&s;ed much art in obliging people of all &s;orts, Di&s;&s;enters as well as Papi&s;ts: yet &s;uch confidence was put in him by the High Church Party, that they bore every thing at his hands: It was not ea&s;y to behave him&s;elf towards the Tru&s;tees, &s;o as not to give a general di&s;ta&s;te to the Nation, for they were much hated, and openly charged with partiality, in|ju&s;tice, and corruption: That which gave the greate&s;t di&s;gu&s;t in his Admini&s;tration there, was, his u&s;age of the reduced Of|ficers, who were upon half pay, a Fund being &s;ettled for that by Act of Parliament: They were ordered to live in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and to be ready for Service there: The Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> call|ed them before him, and required them to expre&s;s under their hands their readine&s;s to go and &s;erve in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies;</HI> They did not comply with this: So he &s;et them a day for their final An&s;wer, and threaten'd, that they &s;hould have no more appointments, if they &s;tood out beyond that time. This was repre&s;ented to the King, as a great hard&s;hip put on them, and as done on de&s;ign to leave <HI>Ireland</HI> de&s;titute of the &s;ervice, that might be done by &s;o many gallant Officers, who were all known to be well affected to the pre&s;ent Government; So the King ordered a &s;top to be put to it.</P>

<HI>Cherburg,</HI> in the year 1692: The other &s;eemed to be laid with more depth, as well as with more infamy, when an Army was brought to <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and the de&s;ign of the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination was thought &s;ure, upon which it was rea&s;onably hoped, that we mu&s;t have fallen into &s;uch convul&s;ions, that we &s;hould have been an ea&s;y prey to an Army ready to invade us. The re|proach, that &s;o black a contrivance ca&s;t upon him, brought him under &s;o much contempt, that even the ab&s;olute Authority of the <HI>French</HI> Court could hardly prevail &s;o far, as to have com|mon re&s;pect paid him after that. He him&s;elf &s;eemed to be the lea&s;t concerned in all his misfortunes; and tho' his Queen could never give over meddling, yet he was the mo&s;t ea&s;y, when he was lea&s;t troubled with tho&s;e airy Schemes, upon which &s;he was &s;till employing her thoughts. He went &s;ometimes to the Mona&s;tery of <HI>La Trappe,</HI> where the poor Monks were much edified with his humble and pious deportment: Hunting was his chief diver&s;ion, and for the mo&s;t part he led a harmle&s;s, in|nocent Life; being &s;till very zealous about his Religion. In the opening of this year, he had been &s;o near Death, that it was generally thought the decline of it would carry him off: He went to <HI>Bourbon,</HI> but had no benefit by the Waters there: In the beginning of <HI>September,</HI> he fell into &s;uch fits, that it was concluded he could not live many days: The King of <HI>France</HI> came to &s;ee him, and &s;eemed to be much touched with the &s;ight: He, with &s;ome difficulty, recommended his Queen and Son to his care and protection; The <HI>French</HI> King an&s;wered, he would reckon their Concerns as his own; and when he left him, he promi&s;ed tho&s;e of his Court, that he would, upon King <HI>James</HI>'s Death, own the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> as King of <HI>England,</HI> and that he would take care of them all. King <HI>James</HI> died on the <HI>6th</HI> day of <HI>September.</HI> He was a Prince that &s;eemed made <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Charac|ter.</NOTE> for greater things, than will be found in the cour&s;e of his Life, more particularly of his Reign: He was e&s;teemed in the for|mer parts of his Life, a Man of great Courage, as he was quite thro' it a man of great application to bu&s;ine&s;s: He had no vivacity of thought, invention or expre&s;&s;ion: But he had a good judgment, where his Religion or his Education gave him not a bia&s;s, which it did very often: He was bred with &s;trange No|tions of the Obedience due to Princes, and came to take up as &s;trange ones, of the Submi&s;&s;ion due to Prie&s;ts: He was natural|ly a man of truth, fidelity, and ju&s;tice: But his Religion was &s;o infu&s;ed in him, and he was &s;o managed in it by his Prie&s;ts, that the Principles which Nature had laid in him, had little
<PB N="293" REF="314">
power over him, when the concerns of his Church &s;tood in the way: He was a gentle Ma&s;ter, and was very ea&s;y to all who came near him: yet he was not &s;o apt to pardon, as one ought to be, that is the Vicegerent of that God, who is &s;low to an|ger, and ready to forgive: He had no per&s;onal Vic$s but of one &s;ort: He was &s;till wandring from one Amour to another, yet he had a real &s;en&s;e of Sin, and was a&s;hamed of it: But Prie&s;ts know how to engage Princes more entirely into their in|tere&s;ts, by making them compound for their Sins, by a great zeal for Holy Church, as they call it. In a word, if it had not been for his Popery, he would have been, if not a great yet a good Prince. By what I once knew of him, and by what I &s;aw him afterwards carried to; I grew more confirmed in the very bad opinion, which I was always apt to have, of the Intrigues of the Popi&s;h Clergy, and of the Confe&s;&s;ors of Kings: He was undone by them, and was their Martyr, &s;o that they ought to bear the chief load of all the errors of his inglorious Reign, and of its fatal Cata&s;trophe. He had the Funeral which he him&s;elf had de&s;ired, private, and without any &s;ort of Ceremo|ny: As he was dying, he &s;aid nothing concerning the Legitimacy of his Son, on which &s;ome made &s;evere remarks: Others thought that, having &s;poken &s;o oft of it before, he might not reflect on the fitne&s;s of &s;aying any thing concerning it, in his la&s;t extre|mity. He recommended to him Firmne&s;s in his Religion, and Ju&s;tice in his Government, if ever he &s;hould come to reign. He &s;aid, that by his practice, he recommended Chri&s;tian For|givene&s;s to him, for he heartily forgave both the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> and the Emperor: It was believed, that the naming the Emperor was &s;ugge&s;ted to him by the <HI>French,</HI> to render the Emperor odious to all tho&s;e of that Religion.</P>
<P>Upon his Death, it was debated in the <HI>French</HI> Council what <NOTE PLACE="marg">The pre|tended Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> own|ed King by the <HI>French</HI> Court.</NOTE> was fit to be done, with relation to his pretended Son: The Mini&s;try advi&s;ed the King to be pa&s;&s;ive, to let him a&s;&s;ume what Title he plea&s;ed, but that, for &s;ome time at lea&s;t, the King &s;hould not declare him&s;elf: This might be &s;ome re&s;traint on the King of <HI>England,</HI> whereas a pre&s;ent Declaration mu&s;t precipi|tate a Rupture: But the <HI>Dauphin</HI> interpo&s;ed with &s;ome heat, for the pre&s;ent owning him King: He thought the King was bound in honour to do it: He was of his Blood, and was dri|ven away on the account of his Religion; So Orders were given to proclaim him at St. <HI>Germains.</HI> The Earl of <HI>Manche&s;|ter,</HI> then the King's Amba&s;&s;ador at <HI>Paris,</HI> told me, that his own Court was going about it; But a difficulty, propo&s;ed by the
<PB N="294" REF="315">
Earl of <HI>Middletoun,</HI> put a &s;top to it: He apprehended, that it would look very &s;trange, and might provoke the Court of <HI>France,</HI> if among his Titles he &s;hould be called King of <HI>France;</HI> and it might di&s;gu&s;t their Party in <HI>England,</HI> if it was omit|ted: So that piece of Ceremony was not performed: Soon af|ter this, the King of <HI>Spain</HI> owned him, &s;o did the Pope and the Duke of <HI>Savoy:</HI> And the King of <HI>France</HI> pre&s;&s;ed all other Princes to do it, in who&s;e Courts he had Mini&s;ters, and pre|vailed on the Pope, to pre&s;s the Emperor and other Popi&s;h Princes to own him, tho' without effect. The King looked up|on this, as an open violation of the Treaty of <HI>Ry&s;wick,</HI> and he ordered the Earl of <HI>Manche&s;ter</HI> to leave that Court, with|out asking an Audience. The <HI>French</HI> pretended, that the bare owning of his Title, &s;ince they gave him no a&s;&s;i&s;tance to make good his Claim, was not a breach of the Treaty: But this could not pa&s;s on the World, &s;ince the owning his Right was a plain Declaration, that they would a&s;&s;i&s;t him in claiming it, when&s;oever the &s;tate of their affairs &s;hould allow of it.</P>
<P>This gave a univer&s;al di&s;ta&s;te to the whole <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation: <NOTE PLACE="marg">With which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation was inflamed.</NOTE> all people &s;eemed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a high indignation upon it, to &s;ee a Foreign Power, that was at Peace with us, pretend to declare who ought to be our King: Even tho&s;e, who were per|haps &s;ecretly well plea&s;ed with it, were yet, as it were forced, for their own &s;afety, to comply with the general &s;en&s;e of the re&s;t in this matter: The City of <HI>London</HI> began, and all the Na|tion followed, in a &s;et of Addre&s;&s;es, expre&s;&s;ing their abhorrence of what the <HI>French</HI> King had done, in taking upon him to declare who &s;hould be their King, and renewing a Vow of Fidelity to the King, and to his Succe&s;&s;ors, according to the Act of Set|tlement. A great diver&s;ity of Stile appeared in the&s;e Addre&s;&s;es, &s;ome avoided to name the <HI>French</HI> King, the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> or the Act of Settlement, and only reflected on the Tran&s;ac|tion in <HI>France,</HI> in general and &s;oft words: But others carried the matter farther, encouraging the King, to go on in his Al|liances, promi&s;ing him all faithful a&s;&s;i&s;tance in &s;upporting them, and a&s;&s;uring him that, when he &s;hould think fit to call a new Parliament, they would choo&s;e &s;uch Members as &s;hould concur in enabling him, to maintain his Alliances: This rai&s;ed the Di|vi&s;ions of the Nation higher.

<P>The fir&s;t thing that &s;ell under Debate, upon his return, was, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A new Par|liament call|ed.</NOTE> whether the Parliament &s;hould be continued, or di&s;&s;olved and a new one called; Some of the leading Men of the former Par|liament had been &s;ecretly askt, how they thought they would proceed, if they &s;hould meet again: of the&s;e, while &s;ome an|&s;wered doubtfully, others &s;aid po&s;itively, they would begin where they had left off, and would in&s;i&s;t on their Im|peachmen. The new Mini&s;try &s;truggled hard again&s;t a Di&s;&s;olution, and when they &s;aw the King re&s;olved on it, &s;ome of them left his Service. This convinced the Nation, that the King was not in a double game, which had been confidently given out before, and was too ea&s;ily believed by many: The heats in Elections encrea&s;ed with every new Summons. This was thought &s;o critical a conjuncture, that both &s;ides exerted their full &s;trength. Mo&s;t of the great Counties, and the chief Cities, cho&s;e Men that were zealous for the King and Govern|ment, but the rotten part of our Con&s;titution, the &s;mall Bur|roughs, were in many places wrought on to choo&s;e bad men; upon the whole however, it appeared, that a clear Majority was in the King's Intere&s;ts, yet the activity of the angry &s;ide was &s;uch, that they had a Majority in choo&s;ing the Speaker, and in determining controverted Elections; but in matters of Publick concern, things went on as the King de&s;ired, and as the Inte|re&s;t of the Nation required.</P>
<P>The King opened the Parliament with the be&s;t Speech that <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Speech.</NOTE> he, or perhaps any other Prince ever made to his People: He laid the &s;tate of our Affairs, both at home and abroad, before them in a mo&s;t pathetical manner; He laid it upon them to con&s;ider the dangers they were in, and not to encrea&s;e the&s;e, by new divi&s;ions among them&s;elves; He expre&s;&s;ed a readine&s;s to forgive all Offences again&s;t him&s;elf, and wi&s;hed they would as readily forgive one another; &s;o that no other divi&s;ion might remain, but that of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> Prote&s;tant and Papi&s;t; He had enter'd into &s;ome Alliances, pur&s;uant to the Addre&s;&s;es of the la&s;t Parliament, and was negotiating &s;ome others, all which &s;hould be laid before them, and this was accordingly done. Both Hou&s;es began with Addre&s;&s;es, in which they did very fully renounce the Prince of <HI>Wales;</HI> The Hou&s;e of Lords ordered that all &s;uch as were willing to do it, &s;hould &s;ign the Addre&s;s, that was enter'd into their Books. This was without a Precedent, and yet it was promoted by tho&s;e, who, as was
<PB N="296" REF="317">
thought, hoped by &s;o unu&s;ual a practice, to prevent any further proceedings on that head. No exception was made to any Ar|ticle of the Alliances: One addition was only propo&s;ed, that no Peace &s;hould be made, till a full reparation was offered to the King, for the Indignity done him, by the <HI>French</HI> King's de|claring the pretended Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> King of <HI>England;</HI> which was &s;oon after propo&s;ed to the Allies, and was agreed to by them all. By the Alliances, the King was obliged to <NOTE PLACE="marg">All were to a War.</NOTE> furni&s;h forty thou&s;and Men to &s;erve in the Armies, be&s;ides what he was to do by Sea: All was con&s;ented to in every particular; angry men &s;hewed much rancour again&s;t the King, and tried to cro&s;s every thing that was propo&s;ed, both as to the Quota's of the Troops we were to furni&s;h, and as to the &s;trength of our Fleet. But the Publick Intere&s;t was now &s;o vi|&s;ible, and the concurrent &s;en&s;e of the Nation ran &s;o vehement|ly for a War, that even tho&s;e who were mo&s;t aver&s;e to it, found it convenient to put on the appearance of zeal for it. The City of <HI>London</HI> was now more united, than it had been at any time during this Reign, for the two Companies that trad|ed to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> &s;aw that their Common Intere&s;t required they &s;hould come to an agreement; and tho' men of ill de|&s;igns did all they could to ob&s;truct it, yet in conclu&s;ion it was happily effected. This made the body of the City, which was formerly much divided between the two Companies, fall now into the &s;ame mea&s;ures. But tho&s;e, who intended to defeat all this good beginning of the Se&s;&s;ion, and to rai&s;e a new flame, &s;et on Debates that mu&s;t have embroil'd all again, if they had &s;ucceeded in their de&s;igns: They began with Complaints of &s;ome Petitions and Addre&s;&s;es, that had reflected on the Pro|ceedings of the la&s;t Hou&s;e of Commons; but it was carried a|gain&s;t them, that it was the Right of the Subjects to petition as they thought them&s;elves aggrieved: yet they were not di&s;cou|raged by this, but went on to complain, that the Lords had deni|ed Ju&s;tice in the matter of the Impeachments. This bore a long and hot Debate in a very full Hou&s;e: But it was carried, tho' by a &s;mall Majority, that Ju&s;tice had not been denied them: After this, the Party gave over any farther &s;truggling, and things were carried on with more unanimity.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of Commons began a Bill of Attainder of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The pre|tended Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> at|tainted.</NOTE> pretended Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> this could not be oppo&s;ed, much le&s;s &s;topt; yet many &s;hewed a coldne&s;s in it, and were ab&s;ent on the days in which it was ordered to be read: It was &s;ent up to the Lords, and it pa&s;t in that Hou&s;e, with an addition of an
<PB N="297" REF="318">
Attainder of the Queen, who acted as Queen Regent for him. This was much oppo&s;ed; for no Evidence could be brought to prove that Allegation, yet the thing was &s;o notorious, that it pa&s;t, and was &s;ent down again to the Commons. It was ex|cepted to there as not regular, &s;ince but one Precedent in King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth's time was brought for it, and in that the Commons had added &s;ome names, by a clau&s;e in a Bill of At|tainder, &s;ent down to them by the Lords; yet as this was a &s;ingle Precedent, &s;o it &s;eemed to be a hard one: Attainders by Bill were the greate&s;t rigours of the Law, &s;o &s;tretches in them ought to be avoided: It was therefore thought more proper to attaint her by a Bill apart, than by a Clau&s;e in another Bill: To this the Lords agreed, &s;o the Bill again&s;t the pretended Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> pa&s;t. The Lords al&s;o pa&s;t a new Bill, attaint|ing the Queen, but that was let &s;leep in the Hou&s;e of Commons.</P>
<P>The matter, that occa&s;ioned the longe&s;t and warme&s;t De|bates <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Act for abjuring him.</NOTE> in both Hou&s;es, was an Act for abjuring the pretended Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and for &s;wearing to the King, by the Title of <HI>Rightful</HI> and <HI>Lawful</HI> King, and to his Heirs, according to the Act of Settlement: This was begun in the Hou&s;e of Lords, and the fir&s;t de&s;ign was, that it &s;hould be voluntary, it being only to be tender'd to all per&s;ons, and their &s;ub&s;cription or refu&s;al to be recorded, without any other penalty. It was vehemently oppo&s;ed by all the Tory Party, at the head of whom the Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI> &s;et him&s;elf. They who argued again&s;t it, &s;aid, that this Government was fir&s;t &s;ettled with another Oath, which was like an Original Contract, and it was unju&s;t and unrea&s;on|able to offer a new one: There was no need of new Oaths, as there was no new &s;trength got by them: Oaths, relating to mens opinions, had been always looked on as &s;evere Impo&s;i|tions: A voluntary Oath &s;eemed to be by its nature unlawful; for we cannot &s;wear lawfully, unle&s;s we are required to do it. To all this it was an&s;wered, that in ancient time, the Oath of Allegiance was &s;hort and &s;imple, becau&s;e then it was not thought that Princes had any right, other than what was conveyed to them by Law: But of late, and indeed very lately, new Opi|nions had been &s;tarted of a Divine Right, with which former times were not acquainted: So it was nece&s;&s;ary to know, who among us adhered to the&s;e opinions: The pre&s;ent Government was begun upon a comprehen&s;ive foot, it being hoped, that all Parties might have been brought to concur in &s;upporting it: But the effects had not an&s;wered expectation: Di&s;tinctions had been made between a King <HI>de jure</HI> and a King <HI>de facto;</HI> by
<PB N="298" REF="319">
the&s;e men plainly declared, with whom they believed the right was lodged: This opinion mu&s;t, when&s;oever that Right comes to be claimed, oblige tho&s;e who hold it, to adhere to &s;uch Clai|mers: It &s;eemed therefore in &s;ome &s;ort nece&s;&s;ary, that the Government &s;hould know, on whom it might depend: The di&s;crimination made, by &s;uch a Te&s;t, was to be without com|pul&s;ion or penalty: no hard&s;hip was put on any per&s;on by it: Tho&s;e who refu&s;ed to give this &s;ecurity, would &s;ee what ju&s;t cau&s;e of jealou&s;y they gave: and would thereby be obliged, to behave them&s;elves decently and with due caution: When a Go|vernment tender'd an Oath, tho' under no penalty, that was a &s;ufficient authority for all to take it, who were &s;atisfied with the &s;ub&s;tance of it: While therefore, there was &s;o great a power beyond Sea, that did &s;o openly e&s;pou&s;e this young man's preten|&s;ions, and while there was ju&s;t grounds to &s;u&s;pect, that many at home favoured him, it &s;eemed very rea&s;onable to offer a me|thod, by which it &s;hould appear, who obeyed the pre&s;ent Go|vernment from a Principle, believing it <HI>Lawful,</HI> and who &s;ub|mitted only to it, as to a pro&s;perous U&s;urpation. About twen|ty Lords per&s;i&s;ted in their oppo&s;ition to this Bill, tho&s;e who were for it being thrice that number: But, in the Hou&s;e of Commons, when it appeared how the Lords were inclined, they re&s;olved to bring in a Bill, that &s;hould oblige all per&s;ons to take this Abjuration. It was drawn by Sir <HI>Charles Hedges;</HI> All Imployments in Church or State were to be &s;ubject to it; Some things were added to the Abjuration, &s;uch as an obliga|tion to maintain the Government in King, Lords, and Com|mons, and to maintain the Church of <HI>England,</HI> together with the Toleration for Di&s;&s;enters: <HI>Finch</HI> offered an alteration to the Clau&s;e, abjuring the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> &s;o that it imported only an obligation not to a&s;&s;i&s;t him; but tho' he pre&s;&s;ed this with unu&s;ual vehemence, in a Debate that he re&s;umed &s;eventeen times in one Se&s;&s;ion, again&s;t all rules, he had few to &s;econd him in it: The Debate, whether the Oath &s;hould be impo&s;ed or left free, held longer: it was carried, but by one Vote, to impo&s;e it: The Party cho&s;e that, rather than to have it left free: for they reckoned the taking an Oath that was impo&s;ed, was a part of their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the U&s;urpation; but the tak|ing any Oath, that &s;trengthened the Government, of their own accord, did not &s;uit with their other Principles: But to help the matter with a &s;hew of zeal, they made the Clau&s;e that im|po&s;ed it very exten&s;ive, &s;o that it comprehended all Clergymen, Fellows of Colleges, Schoolma&s;ters, and private Tutors: The
<PB N="299" REF="320">
Clau&s;e of maintaining the Government in King, Lords, and Commons, was rejected with great indignation; &s;ince the Go|vernment was only in the King: The Lords and Commons be|ing indeed a part of the Con&s;titution, and of the Legi&s;lative Body, but not of the Government. This was a bare-faced Re|publican Notion, and was wont to be condemned as &s;uch, by the &s;ame per&s;ons who now pre&s;&s;ed it. It was farther &s;aid, that if it appeared that our Con&s;titution was in danger, it might be rea&s;onable to &s;ecure it by an Act and an Oath apart: but &s;ince the &s;ingle point, that required this Abjuration, was the <HI>French</HI> King's declaring, that the pretended Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> was our King, it was not fit to join matters foreign to that in this Oath: Upon the &s;ame rea&s;on, the Clau&s;e in favour of the Church, and of the Toleration were al&s;o laid a&s;ide. The de|&s;ign of this Act was to di&s;cover to all, both at home and a|broad, how unanimou&s;ly the Nation concurred in abjuring the pretended Prince of <HI>Wales:</HI> But here was a clau&s;e, to one part of which (the maintaining the Church) the Di&s;&s;enters could not &s;wear; and even the more moderate men of the Church, who did well approve of the Toleration, yet might think it too much to &s;wear to maintain it; &s;ince it was rea&s;onable, to oblige the Di&s;&s;enters to u&s;e their Liberty mode&s;tly, by keeping them un|der the apprehen&s;ion of having it taken away, if it was abu&s;ed by them. One addition was offered, and received without any Debate about it, or the &s;hadow of any oppo&s;ition: It was de|clared to be High Trea&s;on, to endeavour to prevent or defeat the Prince&s;s's Right of Succe&s;&s;ion: The Tories pretended great zeal for her, and gave it out that there was a de&s;ign to &s;et her a&s;ide, and to have the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover</HI> to &s;ucceed the King immediately; tho' it could never be made appear, that any mo|tion of this kind had ever been, either made or debated, even in private di&s;cour&s;e, by any of the whole Whig Party. Great endeavours were u&s;ed, and not altogether without effect, to in|fu&s;e this jealou&s;y into the Prince&s;s, and into all about her, not without in&s;inuations, that the King him&s;elf was inclined to it. When this Clau&s;e was offered, its being without a Precedent, gave handle enough to oppo&s;e it, yet there was not one Word &s;aid in oppo&s;ition to it, in either Hou&s;e, all agreeing heartily in it. This ought to have put an end to the &s;u&s;picion, but &s;ur|mi&s;es of that kind, when rai&s;ed on de&s;ign, are not &s;oon parted with.</P>
<P>Soon after the Se&s;&s;ion was opened, the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> wrote <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in <HI>Ireland.</HI></NOTE> to the King, and asked leave to come over: it was &s;oon grant|ed, but when he &s;ignified this to the Council of <HI>Ireland,</HI> the
<PB N="300" REF="321">
whole Board joined in a reque&s;t to him, that he would lay be|fore the King the great Grievances, under which the whole Kingdom lay, by the proceedings of the Tru&s;tees, who &s;tretch|ed the Authority, that the Law gave them, in many in&s;tances, to the oppre&s;&s;ing of the Nation: He &s;eemed unea&s;y at the mo|tion, but promi&s;ed to lay it before the King, which he did at his coming over. Soon after that, Petitions were &s;ent round all the Counties of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and &s;igned by many, repre&s;enting both the hard&s;hips of the Act, and the &s;evere methods the Tru&s;tees took in executing it: All this was believed, to be &s;et on &s;ecretly by the Court, in hope that &s;ome temper might be found in that matter, &s;o that the King's Grants might again take place in whole or in part. The Hou&s;e of Commons was mov|ed, to proceed &s;everely again&s;t the Promoters of the&s;e Petitions; yet the complaining of Grievances, had been &s;o often a&s;&s;erted to be a Right of the Subject, that this was let fall: But &s;ince no per&s;on appeared, to ju&s;tify the Facts &s;et forth and &s;ugge&s;ted in tho&s;e Petitions, they were voted fal&s;e and &s;candalous, and this &s;topt a further progre&s;s in that method. The heat with which that Act had been carried was now much qualified, and the Tru&s;tees having judged for &s;o many Claims in favour of <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Papi&s;ts, &s;hewing too manife&s;t a partiality for them, and having now &s;ate two years, in which they had con&s;umed all the Rents that aro&s;e out of the confi&s;cated E&s;tates, the Hou&s;e was applied to for their interpo&s;ition, by many Petitions relating to that mat|ter. This was the more nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e, as was formerly told, when that Act was pa&s;&s;ing, they had pa&s;t a Vote again&s;t receiving any Petition, relating to it: The thing had now lo&s;t much of the credit and value that was &s;et upon it at fir&s;t: tho' the &s;ame Party &s;till oppo&s;ed the receiving any Petitions, yet the current was now &s;o &s;trong the other way, that they were all received, and in a great many ca&s;es ju&s;tice was done: yet with a manife&s;t partiality, in favour of Papi&s;ts; it being a maxim, among all who favoured King <HI>James</HI>'s Intere&s;ts, to &s;erve Papi&s;ts, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who&s;e E&s;tates were confi&s;cated for ad|hering to him. One motion was carried, not without difficulty, in favour of tho&s;e, who had purcha&s;ed under the Grantees, and had made great improvements, that they &s;hould be admitted to purcha&s;e, with an abatement of two years value of the E&s;tates; The Earl of <HI>Athlone,</HI> who&s;e ca&s;e was &s;ingular, as was formerly &s;et out, having &s;old his Grant to men, who had rea&s;on to think they had purcha&s;ed under a &s;ecure Title, a &s;pecial Clau&s;e was offered in their favour; but the Party had &s;tudied &s;o far to in|flame the Nation again&s;t the <HI>Dutch,</HI> that in this the Votes
<PB N="301" REF="322">
were equal, and the Speaker's Vote being to turn the matter, he gave it again&s;t the Purcha&s;ers. Many Bills were brought in relating to <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Forfeitures, which took up the greate&s;t part of the Se&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Commons, after a long delay, &s;ent up the Bill, abjur|ing the Prince of <HI>Wales.</HI> In the Hou&s;e of Lords, the Tories oppo&s;ed it all they po&s;&s;ibly could: It was a new Bill, &s;o the Debate was entirely open: They fir&s;t moved for a Clau&s;e, ex|cu&s;ing the Peers from it: If this had been received, the Bill would have been certainly lo&s;t, for the Commons would never have yielded to it: When this was rejected, they tried to have brought it back to be Voluntary: It was a &s;trange piece of in|con&s;i&s;tence in men, to move this, who had argued even again&s;t the lawfulne&s;s of a voluntary Oath; but it was vi&s;ible they in|tended by it only to lo&s;e or at lea&s;t to delay the Bill: When this was over-ruled by the Hou&s;e, not without a mixture of indignation in &s;ome again&s;t the movers; They next offered all tho&s;e Clau&s;es, that had been rejected in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, with &s;ome other very &s;trange additions, by which they di&s;covered both great weakne&s;s, and an inveterate rancour a|gain&s;t the Government; but all the oppo&s;ition ended in a Pro|te&s;tation of nineteen or twenty Peers again&s;t the Bill.</P>
<P>And now I am arrived at the fatal period of this Reign. The <NOTE PLACE="marg">1702 The King's illne&s;s and fall from his Hor&s;e.</NOTE> King &s;eemed all this Winter in a very fair way of recovery; He had made the Royal Apartments in <HI>Hampton-Court</HI> very noble, and he was &s;o much plea&s;ed with the Place, that he went thither once a week, and rode often about the Park: In the end of <HI>February,</HI> the Hor&s;e he rode on &s;tumbled, and he, being then very feeble, fell off and broke his Collar-bone: He &s;eemed to have no other hurt by it, and his &s;trength was then &s;o much impaired, that it was not thought nece&s;&s;ary to let him Blood, no Symptom appearing that required it: The Bone was well &s;et, and it was thought there was no danger: &s;o he was brought to <HI>Ken&s;ington</HI> that night: He him&s;elf had apprehended all this Winter, that he was &s;inking; he &s;aid to the Earl of <HI>Port|land,</HI> both before and after this accident, that he was a dead man: It was not in his Legs, nor now in his Collar-Bone, that he felt him&s;elf ill, but all was decayed within, &s;o that he be|lieved he &s;hould not be able to go thro' the fatigue of another Campaign. During his illne&s;s, he &s;ent a Me&s;&s;age to the Two Hou&s;es, recommending the Union of both Kingdoms to them. The occa&s;ion of this was, a Motion that the Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI> had made, in the Hou&s;e of Lords, when the Act of Abjuration
<PB N="302" REF="323">
was agreed to: He &s;aid, tho' he had differed from the Majori|ty of the Hou&s;e, in many particulars relating to it, yet he was &s;uch a friend to the de&s;ign of the Act, that in order to the &s;ecuring a Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, he thought an Union of the whole I&s;land was very nece&s;&s;ary; and that therefore, they &s;hould con&s;ider how both Kingdoms might be united; but in order to this, and previous to it, he moved, that an Addre&s;s &s;hould be made to the King, that he would be plea&s;ed to di&s;&s;olve the Parliament now &s;itting in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to call a new one: Since the pre&s;ent Parliament was at fir&s;t a Convention, and then turned to a Parliament, and was continued ever &s;ince, &s;o that the Legality of it might be called in que&s;tion: and it was nece&s;|&s;ary, that &s;o important a thing, as the Union of both King|doms, &s;hould be treated in a Parliament, again&s;t the Con&s;titution of which no exception could lie. The Motion was warmly op|po&s;ed; for that Nation was then in &s;uch a ferment, that the calling a new Parliament would have been probably attended with bad con&s;equences: So that Project was let fall, and no progre&s;s was made upon the King's Me&s;&s;age. On the third of <HI>March,</HI> the King had a &s;hort fit of an Ague, which he re|garded &s;o little, that he &s;aid nothing of it: It returned on him next day: I happened to be then near him, and ob&s;erved &s;uch a vi&s;ible alteration, as gave me a very ill opinion of his condi|tion: After that, he kept his Chamber till <HI>Friday;</HI> every day it was given out that his Fits abated: On <HI>Friday,</HI> things had &s;o melancholy a face, that his being dangerou&s;ly ill was no lon|ger concealed: There was now &s;uch a difficulty of breathing, and his pul&s;e was &s;o &s;unk, that the alarm was given out every where: He had &s;ent the Earl of <HI>Albemarle</HI> over to <HI>Holland,</HI> to put things in a readine&s;s for an early Campaign. He came back on the <HI>7th</HI> of <HI>March</HI> in the morning, with &s;o good an account of every thing, that, if matters of that kind could have wrought on the King, it mu&s;t have revived him: but the coldne&s;s with which he received it, &s;hewed how little hopes were left: Soon after, he &s;aid <HI>Je tire vers ma fin, (I draw towards my end.)</HI> The Act of Ab|juration, and the Money Bill, were now prepared for the Royal A&s;&s;ent: The Council ordered all things to be in a readine&s;s, for the pa&s;&s;ing of tho&s;e Bills by a &s;pecial Commi&s;&s;ion, which ac|cording to form mu&s;t be &s;igned by the King, in the pre&s;ence of the Lord Keeper and the Clerks of the Parliament: They came to the King, when his Fit began, and &s;tayed &s;ome hours before they were admitted: Some in the Hou&s;e of Commons moved for an Adjournment, tho' the Lords had &s;ent to them not to adjourn for &s;ome time: By this means, they hoped the
<PB N="303" REF="324">
Bill of Abjuration &s;hould be lo&s;t; But it was contrary to all rules to adjourn, when &s;uch a Me&s;&s;age was &s;ent them by the Lords, &s;o they waited till the King had &s;igned the Commi&s;&s;ion and the Bills, and thus tho&s;e Acts pa&s;s'd in the la&s;t day of the King's Life.</P>
<P>The King's &s;trength and pul&s;e was &s;till &s;inking, as the difficul|ty <NOTE PLACE="marg">And Death.</NOTE> of breathing encrea&s;ed, &s;o that no hope was left. The Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> and I went to him on <HI>Saturday</HI> morn|ing, and did not &s;tir from him till he died. The Archbi&s;hop prayed on <HI>Saturday</HI> &s;ome time with him, but he was then &s;o weak, that he could &s;carce &s;peak, but gave him his hand, as a &s;ign that he firmly believed the Truth of the Chri&s;tian Religion, and &s;aid, he intended to receive the Sacrament: His rea&s;on and all his &s;en&s;es were entire to the la&s;t minute: About five in the morning he de&s;ired the Sacrament, and went thro' the Office with great appearance of &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, but could not expre&s;s him&s;elf: When this was done, he called for the Earl of <HI>Albe|marle,</HI> and gave him a charge to take care of his Papers. He thanked Mr. <HI>Auverquerque</HI> for his long and faithful &s;ervices. He took leave of the Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> and called for the Earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> but before he came, his Voice quite failed, &s;o he took him by the hand, and carried it to his heart with great ten|derne&s;s. He was often looking up to Heaven, in many &s;hort Ejaculations; between &s;even and eight a Clock the rattle began, the Commendatory Prayer was &s;aid for him, and as it ended, he died, in the fifty &s;econd year of his Age, having reigned thir|teen years and a few days. When his Body was opened, it appeared that, notwith&s;tanding the &s;welling of his Legs, he had no Drop&s;y: His Head and Heart was &s;ound: There was &s;carce any Blood in his Body: His Lungs &s;tuck to his Side, and by the fall from his Hor&s;e, a part of them was torn from it, which occa&s;ioned an Inflammation, that was believed to be the imme|diate cau&s;e of his Death, which probably might have been pre|vented for &s;ome time, if he had been then let Blood. His Death would have been a great &s;troke at any time, but in our circum&s;tances, as they &s;tood at that time, it was a dreadful one. The Earl of <HI>Portland</HI> told me, that when he was once encourag|ing him, from the good &s;tate his affairs were in, both at home and abroad, to take more heart; the King an&s;wered him, that he knew Death was that, which he had looked at on all occa|&s;ions without any terror, &s;ometimes he would have been glad to have been delivered out of all his troubles, but he confe&s;&s;ed now he &s;aw another Scene, and could wi&s;h to live a little lon|ger. He died with a clear and full pre&s;ence of mind, and in
<PB N="304" REF="325">
a wonderful tranquillity: Tho&s;e who knew it was his Rule all his Life long, to hide the impre&s;&s;ions that Religion made on him, as much as po&s;&s;ible, did not wonder at his &s;ilence in his la&s;t minutes, but they lamented it much: They knew what a handle it would give to cen&s;ure and obloquy.</P>
<P>Thus lived and died <HI>William</HI> the Third, King of <HI>Great-Bri|tain,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Charac|ter.</NOTE> and Prince of <HI>Orange;</HI> He had a thin and weak Body, was brown haired, and of a clear and delicate Con&s;titution: He had a <HI>Roman</HI> Eagle No&s;e, bright and &s;parkling Eyes, a large front, and a Countenance compo&s;ed to gravity and authority: All his Sen&s;es were critical and exqui&s;ite. He was always a&s;th|matical, and the dregs of the Small Pox falling on his Lungs, he had a con&s;tant deep Cough. His Behaviour was &s;olemn and &s;erious, &s;eldom cheerful, and but with a few: He &s;poke little and very &s;lowly, and mo&s;t commonly with a di&s;gu&s;ting dryne&s;s, which was his Character at all times, except in a day of Bat|tle: for then he was all fire, tho' without pa&s;&s;ion: He was then every where, and looked to every thing. He had no great ad|vantage from his Education; <HI>De Wit</HI>'s Di&s;cour&s;es were of great u&s;e to him, and he, being apprehen&s;ive of the ob&s;er|vation of tho&s;e, who were looking narrowly into every thing he &s;aid or did, had brought him&s;elf under a habitual cau|tion, that he could never &s;hake off, tho' in another &s;cene it proved as hurtful, as it was then nece&s;&s;ary to his affairs: He &s;poke <HI>Dutch, French, Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>German</HI> equally well; and he under&s;tood the <HI>Latin, Spani&s;h</HI> and <HI>Italian,</HI> &s;o that he was well fitted to command Armies compo&s;ed of &s;everal Nations. He had a Memory that amazed all about him, for it never failed him: He was an exact ob&s;erver of men and things: His &s;trength lay rather in a true di&s;cerning and a &s;ound judgment, than in imagination or invention: His De&s;igns were always great and good: But it was thought he tru&s;ted too much to that, and that he did not de&s;cend enough to the humours of his people, to make him&s;elf and his notions more acceptable to them: This, in a Government that has &s;o much of freedom in it as ours, was more nece&s;&s;ary than he was inclined to believe: His re&s;ervedne&s;s grew on him, &s;o that it di&s;gu&s;ted mo&s;t of tho&s;e who &s;erved him: but he had ob&s;erved the errors of too much talking, more than tho&s;e of too cold a &s;ilence. He did not like contradiction, nor to have his actions cen&s;ured: but he loved to imploy and favour tho&s;e, who had the arts of com|placence, yet he did not love Flatterers: His genius lay chiefly to War, in which his courage was more admired than his con|duct: Great errors were often committed by him, but his he|roical
<PB N="305" REF="326">
courage &s;et things right, as it inflamed tho&s;e who were about him: He was too lavi&s;h of money on &s;ome occa&s;ions, both in his Buildings and to his Favourites, but too &s;paring in re|warding Services, or in encouraging tho&s;e who brought Intelli|gence: He was apt to take ill impre&s;&s;ions of people, and the&s;e &s;tuck long with him; but he never carried them to indecent revenges: He gave too much way to his own humour, almo&s;t in every thing, not excepting that which related to his own health: He knew all Foreign Affairs well, and under&s;tood the State of every Court in <HI>Europe</HI> very particularly: He in&s;tructed his own Mini&s;ters him&s;elf, but he did not apply enough to Af|fairs at home: He tried how he could govern us, by ballancing the two Parties one again&s;t another, but he came at la&s;t to be per&s;uaded, that the Tories were irreconcilable to him, and he was re&s;olved to try and tru&s;t them no more. He believed the Truth of the Chri&s;tian Religion very firmly, and he expre&s;&s;ed a horror at Athei&s;m and Bla&s;phemy: and tho' there was much of both in his Court, yet it was always denied to him, and kept out of &s;ight. He was mo&s;t exemplarily decent and devout, in the publick exerci&s;es of the Wor&s;hip of God, only on week days he came too &s;eldom to them: He was an attentive hearer of Sermons, and was con&s;tant in his private Prayers, and in read|ing the Scriptures: And when he &s;poke of religious matters, which he did not often, it was with a becoming gravity: He was much po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the belief of ab&s;olute Decrees: He &s;aid to me, he adhered to the&s;e, becau&s;e he did not &s;ee how the Belief of Providence could be maintained upon any other Suppo&s;ition: His indifference as to the Forms of Church-Government, and his being zealous for Toleration, together with his cold Behaviour towards the Clergy, gave them generally very ill impre&s;&s;ions of him: In his deportment towards all about him, He &s;eemed to make little di&s;tinction between the good and the bad, and tho&s;e who &s;erved well, or tho&s;e who &s;erved him ill: He loved the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and was much beloved among them: but the ill returns he met from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, their jealou&s;ies of him, and their perver&s;ene&s;s towards him, had too much &s;oured his Mind, and had in a great mea&s;ure alienated him from them, which he did not take care enough to conceal, tho' he &s;aw the ill effects this had upon his bu&s;ine&s;s. He grew, in his la&s;t years, too remi&s;s and carele&s;s as to all Affairs; till the Treacheries of <HI>France</HI> awakened him, and the dreadful con|junction of the Monarchies gave &s;o loud an Alarm to all <HI>Europe.</HI> For a watching over that Court, and a be&s;tirring him&s;elf again&s;t their practices, was the prevailing pa&s;&s;ion of his whole Life:
<PB N="306" REF="327">
Few men had the art of concealing and governing Pa&s;&s;ion more than he had; yet few men had &s;tronger Pa&s;&s;ions, which were &s;eldom felt but by inferior Servants, to whom he u&s;ually made &s;uch recompences, for any &s;udden or indecent vents he might give his anger, that they were glad at every time, that it broke upon them: He was too ea&s;y to the faults of tho&s;e about him, when they did not lie in his own way, or cro&s;s any of his de&s;igns: and he was &s;o apt to think, that his Mini&s;ters might grow in&s;olent, if they &s;hould find that they had much credit with him, that he &s;eemed to have made it a Maxim, to let them often feel, how little power they had, even in &s;mall matters: His Favourites had a more intire power, but he accu&s;tomed them only to inform him of things, but to be &s;paring in offer|ing Advice, except when it was asked: It was not ea&s;y to ac|count for the rea&s;ons of the favour that he &s;hewed, in the high|e&s;t in&s;tances, to two per&s;ons beyond all others, the Earls of <HI>Portland</HI> and <HI>Albemarle;</HI> they being in all re&s;pects men, not only of different, but of oppo&s;ite Characters: Secrecy and Fi|delity were the only qualities, in which it could be &s;aid, that they did in any &s;ort agree. I have now run thro' the chief branches of his Character; I had occa&s;ion to know him well, having ob&s;erved him very carefully in a cour&s;e of Sixteen years: I had a large mea&s;ure of his favour, and a free acce&s;s to him all the while, tho' not at all times to the &s;ame degree: The freedom, that I u&s;ed with him, was not always acceptable: but he &s;aw that I &s;erved him faithfully, &s;o, after &s;ome intervals of coldne&s;s, he always returned to a good mea&s;ure of confi|dence in me: I was, in many great in&s;tances, much obliged by him; but that was not my chief bia&s;s to him: I con&s;idered him, as a Per&s;on rai&s;ed up by God to re&s;i&s;t the Power of <HI>France,</HI> and the progre&s;s of Tyranny and Per&s;ecution: The Series of the five Princes of <HI>Orange,</HI> that was now ended in him, was the noble&s;t Succe&s;&s;ion of Heroes that we find in any Hi&s;tory: And the thirty years, from the year 1672 to his Death, in which he acted &s;o great a part, carry in them &s;o many amazing &s;teps of a glorious and di&s;tingui&s;hing Providence, that in the words of <HI>David,</HI> he may be called, <HI>The man of God's right hand, whom he made &s;trong for him&s;elf:</HI> After all the abatements, that may be allowed for his Errors and Faults, he ought &s;till to be rec|koned among the greate&s;t Princes that our Hi&s;tory, or indeed that any other, can afford. He died in a critical time for his own Glory; &s;ince he had formed a great Alliance, and had projected the whole Scheme of the War; &s;o that if it &s;ucceeds, a great part of the Honour of it will be a&s;cribed to him: and
<PB N="307" REF="328">
if otherwi&s;e, it will be &s;aid He was the Soul of the Alliance, that did both animate and knit it together, and that it was na|tural for that Body to die and fall a&s;under, when he who gave it life, was withdrawn. Upon his Death, &s;ome moved for a magnificent Funeral; but it &s;eemed not decent to run into un|nece&s;&s;ary Expence, when we were entring on a War, that mu&s;t be maintained at a va&s;t charge: &s;o a private Funeral was re&s;olv|ed on. But for the Honour of his Memory, a noble Monument and an Eque&s;trian Statue were ordered. Some years mu&s;t &s;hew whether the&s;e things were really intended, or if they were only &s;poke of to excu&s;e the Privacy of his Funeral, which was &s;carce decent, &s;o far was it from being Magnificent.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the Life and Reign of Queen <HI>ANNE.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_BY the Death of King <HI>William,</HI> pur&s;uant to the Act <NOTE PLACE="marg">1702 Queen <HI>Anne</HI> &s;ucceeds.</NOTE> that had &s;ettled the Succe&s;&s;ion of the Crown, it devolved on <HI>Anne,</HI> the younge&s;t Daughter of King <HI>James,</HI> by his fir&s;t Marriage; She was then entred on the Thirty eighth year of her Age. Upon the King's Death, the Privy Council came in a body, to wait on the new Queen: She received them with a well con&s;i|dered <NOTE PLACE="marg">Her Fir&s;t Speech.</NOTE> Speech: She expre&s;&s;ed great re&s;pect to the Memory of the late King, in who&s;e &s;teps &s;he intended to go, for pre&s;erving both Church and State, in oppo&s;ition to the growing Power
<PB N="310" REF="330">
of <HI>France,</HI> and for maintaining the Succe&s;&s;ion in the Prote&s;tant Line: She pronounced this, as &s;he did all her other Speeches, with great weight and authority, and with a &s;oftne&s;s of Voice and &s;weetne&s;s in the pronunciation, that added much life to all &s;he &s;poke. The&s;e her fir&s;t Expre&s;&s;ions were heard with great and ju&s;t acknowledgments: Both Hou&s;es of Parliament met that day, and made Addre&s;&s;es to her, full of re&s;pect and duty: She an&s;wered both very favourably, and &s;he received all that came to her in &s;o gracious a manner, that they went from her highly &s;atisfied with her goodne&s;s, and her obliging deport|ment; for &s;he hearkened with attention to every thing that was &s;aid to her. Two days after, &s;he went to the Parliament, which, to the great happine&s;s of the Nation, and to the advan|tage of her Government, was now continued to &s;it, notwith|&s;tanding the King's Demi&s;e, by the Act, that was made five years before, upon the di&s;covery of the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination Plot. In her Speech &s;he repeated, but more copiou&s;ly, what &s;he had &s;aid to the Council, upon her fir&s;t Acce&s;&s;ion to the Throne: There were two pa&s;&s;ages in this Speech, that were thought not &s;o well con&s;idered: She a&s;&s;ured them, her Heart was <HI>entirely Engli&s;h:</HI> This was looked on, as a reflection on the late King: &s;he al&s;o added, that they might <HI>depend on her word:</HI> Both the&s;e Expre&s;|&s;ions had been in her Father's fir&s;t Speech, how little &s;oever they were afterwards minded by him. The City of <HI>London,</HI> and all the Counties, Cities, and even the &s;ubaltern Bodies of Cities, came up with Addre&s;&s;es: In the&s;e, a very great diver&s;ity of Stile was ob&s;erved, &s;ome mentioned the late King in terms full of re|&s;pect and gratitude; others named him very coldly: &s;ome took no notice of him, nor of his death; and &s;imply congratulated her coming to the Crown: and &s;ome in&s;inuated reflections on his Memory, as if the Queen had been ill u&s;ed by him. The Queen received all civilly, to mo&s;t &s;he &s;aid nothing, to others &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf in general words, and &s;ome things were given out in her Name, which &s;he di&s;owned.</P>
<P>Within a week after her coming to the Crown, &s;he &s;ent the <NOTE PLACE="marg">She pur&s;ues the Alliance and the War.</NOTE> Earl of <HI>Marlborough</HI> to <HI>Holland,</HI> to give the <HI>States</HI> full a&s;&s;u|rances of her maintaining the Alliances, that had been con|cluded by the late King, and of doing every thing that the common concerns of <HI>Europe</HI> required: She gave notice al&s;o of her coming to the Crown to all the Princes and States of <HI>Eu|rope,</HI> except <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI> The Earl of <HI>Marlborough</HI> &s;tay'd &s;ome days in <HI>Holland,</HI> to very good purpo&s;e: The King's Death had &s;truck them all with &s;uch a damp, that they need|ed the encouragement of &s;uch a Me&s;&s;age, as he brought them:
<PB N="311" REF="331">
When they had the fir&s;t news of the King's Death, they a&s;&s;em|bled together immediately, they looked on one another as men amazed: They embraced one another, and promi&s;ed they would &s;tick together, and adhere to the intere&s;ts of their Countrey: They &s;ate up mo&s;t of the night, and &s;ent out all the Orders that were nece&s;&s;ary, upon &s;o extraordinary an emergency. They were now much revived by the Earl of <HI>Marlborough</HI>'s pre&s;ence, and by the temper that both Hou&s;es of Parliament were in, with relation to the Alliances, and the War with <HI>France:</HI> and they entered into &s;uch Confidence with the Earl of <HI>Marlbo|rough,</HI> that he came back as well &s;atisfied with them, as they were with him. The Queen in her fir&s;t Speech, had asked of the Commons the continuance of that Revenue, which &s;upport|ed the Civil Li&s;t, and it was granted to her for Life, very una|nimou&s;ly, tho' many &s;eemed to apprehend, that &s;o great a Re|venue might be applied to u&s;es, not &s;o profitable to the Pub|lick, in a Reign that was like to be frugal, and probably would not be &s;ubject to great accidents. When the Queen came to pa&s;s the Act, and to thank the Parliament for it; &s;he &s;aid, &s;he intended to apply one hundred thou&s;and pounds of it, to the publick occa&s;ions of the pre&s;ent year: This was received with great applau&s;e, and particular notice was taken of it, in all the Addre&s;&s;es that came up afterwards.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, the Queen pa&s;&s;ed a Bill for receiving and <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Bill for the Publick Accounts.</NOTE> examining the Publick Accounts; and in her Speech, &s;he ex|pre&s;&s;ed a particular approbation of that Bill: a Commi&s;&s;ion to the &s;ame effect had been kept up, for &s;ix or &s;even years, during the former Reign, but it had been let fall for &s;ome years; &s;ince the Commi&s;&s;ioners had never been able to make any di&s;|covery what&s;oever, and &s;o had put the Publick to a con&s;iderable charge, without reaping any &s;ort of fruit from it. Whether this flowed from the weakne&s;s or corruption of the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners, or from the integrity or cunning of tho&s;e, who dealt in the Publick Money, cannot be determined. The Party that had oppo&s;ed the late King, had made this the chief &s;ub|ject of their Complaints all the Nation over, that the Publick was robbed, and that private men lived high, and yet rai&s;ed large E&s;tates out of the Publick Trea&s;ure: This had a great effect over <HI>England;</HI> for all people naturally hearken to Complaints of this kind, and very ea&s;ily believe them: It was al&s;o &s;aid, to excu&s;e the fruitle&s;sne&s;s of the former Commi&s;&s;ions, that no di&s;|coveries could be made, under a Mini&s;try, that would &s;urely fa|vour their under-workmen, tho' they were known to be Guilty. One vi&s;ible cau&s;e of mens rai&s;ing great E&s;tates, who were con|cerned
<PB N="312" REF="332">
in the Admini&s;tration, was this, that for &s;ome years the Parliament laid the Taxes upon very remote Funds, &s;o that, be|&s;ides the di&s;tance of the term of Payment, for which Intere&s;t was allowed, the danger the Government it&s;elf &s;eemed to be of|ten in (upon the continuance of which the continuance and a&s;|&s;ignment of the&s;e Funds was grounded) made that &s;ome Tallies were &s;old at a great di&s;count, even of the one half, to tho&s;e who would employ their Money that way, by which great ad|vantages were made. The gain that was made, by robbing the Coin, in which many Gold&s;miths were believed to be deep|ly concerned, contributed not a little to the rai&s;ing tho&s;e va&s;t E&s;tates, to which &s;ome had grown, as &s;uddenly as unaccounta|bly. All the&s;e complaints were ea&s;ily rai&s;ed, and long kept up, on de&s;ign to ca&s;t the heavier load on the former Mini&s;try: This made that Mini&s;try, who were &s;en&s;ible of the mi&s;chief this cla|mour did them, and of their own innocence, promote the Bill with much zeal, and put the &s;tronge&s;t Clau&s;es in it, that could be contrived to make it effectual. The Commi&s;&s;ioners named in the Bill, were the hotte&s;t men in the Hou&s;e, who had rai&s;ed as well as kept up the clamour, with the greate&s;t earne&s;tne&s;s. One Clau&s;e put in the Act, was not very acceptable to the Commi&s;&s;ioners; for they were rendered incapable of all Im|ployments, during the Commi&s;&s;ion: The Act carried a Retro|&s;pect quite back to the Revolution: It was given out, that great di&s;coveries would be made by them, and the art and indu&s;try with which this was &s;pread over <HI>England,</HI> had a great effect in the Elections to the &s;ucceeding Parliament. The Coronation was on the <HI>23d</HI> of <HI>April,</HI> on St. <HI>George</HI>'s day; it was perform|ed with the u&s;ual Magnificence; The Archbi&s;hop of <HI>York</HI> preached a good and wi&s;e Sermon on the occa&s;ion: The Queen, immediately after that, gave Orders for naming the Electore&s;s of <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> in the Collect for the Royal Family, as the next Heir of the Crown; and &s;he formed a Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>The coldne&s;s had continued between the King and her, to &s;uch a degree, that tho' there was a reconciliation after the <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Min&s;try $ormed.</NOTE> Queen's Death, yet it went not much farther, than what civility and decency required: She was not made acquainted with pub|lick Affairs; She was not encouraged to recommend any to Po&s;ts of tru&s;t and advantage: Nor had the Mini&s;try Orders to inform her how matters went, nor to oblige tho&s;e about her: Only pains had been taken to plea&s;e the Earl of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> with which he was fully &s;atisfied: nothing had contented him better, than the Command he had the former year of the Troops, which were &s;ent to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>States.</HI> The Whigs had
<PB N="313" REF="333">
lived at a great di&s;tance with the Queen, all the former Reign: The Tories had made much noi&s;e with their zeal for her, chiefly after the death of the Duke of <HI>Gloce&s;ter,</HI> tho' they came &s;eldom to her: Her Court was then very thin, &s;he lived in a due ab&s;trac|tion from bu&s;ine&s;s; &s;o that &s;he neither gave jealou&s;y, nor encou|raged faction: Yet the&s;e things had made tho&s;e impre&s;&s;ions on her, that had at fir&s;t ill effects, which were &s;oon ob&s;erved and reme|died. The late King had &s;ent a Me&s;&s;age to the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> &s;ome weeks before he died, letting him know, that he had put an end to his Commi&s;&s;ion of Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> but that was not executed in form; &s;o the Commi&s;&s;ion did &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t in his per&s;on: He was upon that now declared Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland.</HI> The Lord <HI>Godolphin</HI> was made Lord Trea&s;urer: This was very $span$&s;y to him&s;elf, for he re&s;i&s;ted the motion long; but the Earl of <HI>Marlborough</HI> pre&s;&s;ed it in &s;o po&s;itive a manner, that he &s;aid he could not go beyond Sea to command our Armies, un|le&s;s the Trea&s;ury was put in his hands; for then he was &s;ure that remittances would be punctually made to him: He was declared Captain General, and the Prince had the Title of Generali&s;&s;imo of all the Queen's Forces by Sea or Land. It was for &s;ome time given out, that the Prince intended to go beyond Sea, to com|mand the Armies of the Alliance, but this report &s;oon fell; and it was &s;aid, the <HI>Dutch</HI> were not willing to tru&s;t their Armies to the command of a Prince, who might think it below him to be limit|ed by their In&s;tructions, or to be bound to obey their Orders. The late King had di&s;&s;olved the Commi&s;&s;ion, for executing the Of|fice of the Lord Admiral, and had committed that great Tru&s;t to the Earl of <HI>Pembroke:</HI> The Secrets of that Board were &s;o ill kept, and there was &s;uch a Faction in it, that the King re&s;olved to put it in a &s;ingle per&s;on: The Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> was not ea&s;ily brought to &s;ubmit to it: He &s;aw it would drawn a heavy load on him, and he was &s;en&s;ible that by his ignorance of Sea Affairs, he might com|mit errors: yet he took good Officers to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance: He re&s;olv|ed to command the Fleet in per&s;on, and he took great pains to put things in &s;uch Order, that it might be &s;oon ready. A Land Army was de&s;igned to go with the Fleet, to the Command of which the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> had been named: But upon new mea&s;ures, the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> was fir&s;t &s;ent to, not to go to Sea in per|&s;on, and &s;oon after he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his Po&s;t, with the of|fer of a great Pen&s;ion, which he very generou&s;ly refu&s;ed, tho' the &s;tate of his Affairs and Family &s;eemed to require it. The Prince was made Lord High Admiral, which he was to govern by a Council: the Legality of this was much que&s;tioned, for it was a new Court, which could not be authorized to act, but by an Act of Parliament: yet the re&s;pect paid the Queen made that no pub|lick
<PB N="314" REF="334">
que&s;tion was made of this, &s;o that objections to it never went beyond a &s;ecret murmur. The Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI> and Sir <HI>Charles Hedges</HI> were made Secretaries of State: The Tories would tru&s;t none but the Earl of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> and he would &s;erve with none but <HI>Hedges;</HI> The Maxim laid down at Court, was, to put the direction of Affairs in the hands of the Tories. The Earl of <HI>Marlborough</HI> a&s;&s;ured me this was done, upon the promi&s;es they made to carry on the War, and to maintain the Alliances: if they kept the&s;e, then Affairs would go on &s;moothly in the Hou&s;e of Commons, but if they failed in this, the Queen would put her bu&s;ine&s;s in other hands, which at that time few could believe. The Marqui&s;s of <HI>Normanby</HI> was, to the admiration of all men, made Lord Privy Seal, and &s;oon after Duke of <HI>Buckingham:</HI> The Earl of <HI>Abington,</HI> Vi&s;count <HI>Weymouth,</HI> Lord <HI>Dartmouth, Seimour, Mu&s;grave, Greenvil, How, Lucan Gower, Harcourt,</HI> with &s;everal others, who had, during the la&s;t Reign, expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t violent and unrelenting aver&s;ion to the whole Admini&s;tration, were now brought to the Council Board, and put in good Po&s;ts.</P>
<P>Before the King's death, it was generally thought, that &s;ome in <NOTE PLACE="marg">Few refu&s;ed the Abjura|tion.</NOTE> both Hou&s;es, and many more over the Nation, would refu&s;e the Abjuration: They had oppo&s;ed it &s;o vehemently, that no le&s;s could be expected from them. Some went out of Town when the day came, in which the Hou&s;es re&s;olved to try all their Mem|bers; but they &s;oon came to other Re&s;olutions, and with them almo&s;t the whole Party came and took the Oath, and profe&s;&s;ed great zeal for the Queen, and an entire &s;atisfaction in her Title. Some &s;u&s;pected this was Treachery, on de&s;ign to get the Govern|ment once into their hands, that &s;o they might deliver it up, or at lea&s;t that they might carry a Parliament &s;o to their mind, that the Act might be repealed; and they might think, that then the Oath would fall with it. Di&s;tinctions were &s;et about among them, which heightened the&s;e &s;u&s;picions; for tho' in the Oath, they declared, that the pretended Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> had not any Right what&s;oever to the Crown, yet in a Paper (which I &s;aw) that went about a|mong them, it was &s;aid that <HI>Right</HI> was a term of Law, which had only relation to <HI>Legal Rights,</HI> but not to a <HI>Divine Right,</HI> or to <HI>Birth Right:</HI> So &s;ince that Right was condemned by Law, they, by abjuring it, did not renounce the <HI>Divine Right,</HI> that he had by his Birth. They al&s;o &s;uppo&s;ed, that this Abjuration could only bind, during the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, but not in ca&s;e of another Revolution, or of a Conque&s;t: This was too dark a thing, to be enquired after, or &s;een into, in the &s;tate matters were then in. The Queen continued mo&s;t of the great Officers of the Hou&s;hold, all the Judges except two, and mo&s;t of the Lords Lieutenants of Counties; nor did &s;he make any change in the Fo|reign

Mini&s;try. It was generally believed, that the Earl of <HI>Ro|che&s;ter</HI> and his Party were for &s;evere methods, and for a more entire change, to be carried quite thro' all &s;ubaltern Imployments; But that the Lord <HI>Godolphin</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Marlborough</HI> were for more moderate proceedings: So that tho' no Whigs were put into Imployments, yet many were kept in the Po&s;ts they had been put into during the former Reign. Repeated a&s;&s;urances were &s;ent to all the Allies, that the Queen would adhere firmly to them.</P>
<P>The Queen in her fir&s;t Speech to her Parliament, had renewed <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Union of both Kingdoms propo&s;ed.</NOTE> the Motion, made by the late King, for the Union of both King|doms: Many of tho&s;e, who &s;eemed now to have the greate&s;t &s;hare of her favour and confidence, oppo&s;ed it with much heat, and not without indecent reflexions on the <HI>Scotch</HI> Nation; yet it was carried by a great Majority, that the Queen &s;hould be em|powered to name Commi&s;&s;ioners, for treating of an Union: It was &s;o vi&s;ibly the Intere&s;t of <HI>England,</HI> and of the pre&s;ent Govern|ment, to &s;hut that back door again&s;t the practices of <HI>France,</HI> and the attempts of the pretended Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> that the oppo&s;ition made to this fir&s;t &s;tep towards an Union, and the indecent &s;corn with which <HI>Seimour</HI> and others treated the <HI>Scots,</HI> were clear indi|cations that the Po&s;ts they were brought into, had not changed their tempers: but that in&s;tead of healing matters, they intended to irritate them farther, by their reproachful Speeches. The Bill went thro' both Hou&s;es, notwith&s;tanding the rough treatment it met with at fir&s;t.</P>

<P>A Report was &s;pread about the Town, and over the Nation, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A fal&s;e re|port of de|&s;igna again&s;t the Queen.</NOTE> with &s;uch a &s;eeming a&s;&s;urance, that many were inclined to be|lieve it, that a Scheme had been found among the King's Pa|pers, for &s;etting a&s;ide the Queen; Some added for impri&s;oning her, and for bringing the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover</HI> immediately into the Succe&s;&s;ion; and that, to &s;upport this, a great change was to be made in all the Imployments and Offices over the whole King|dom: This, many of tho&s;e, who were now in Po&s;ts, had talked in &s;o publick a manner, that it appeared they intended to po&s;&s;e&s;s the

whole Nation with a belief of it; hoping thereby to alienate the people from tho&s;e, who had been in the late King's confidence, and di&s;grace all that &s;ide, in order to the carrying all Elections of Parliament for Men of their Party. Five Lords had been or|dered by the Queen to vi&s;it the late King's Papers, and bring her &s;uch of them, as related to the Alliances or other Affairs of the Crown: The&s;e were the Dukes of <HI>Somer&s;et</HI> and <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> and the Earls of <HI>Marlborough, Jer&s;ey,</HI> and <HI>Albemarle:</HI> The Whigs &s;aw the de&s;ign which was driven at, by tho&s;e fal&s;e reports; &s;o a Motion was made in the Hou&s;e of Lords, by the Earl of <HI>Car|li&s;le,</HI> and &s;econded by the Lords <HI>Wharton, Halifax,</HI> and others, that an enquiry &s;hould be made, into the truth of that Report, and of all other &s;tories of that kind, that &s;o, if there was any truth in them, &s;uch as had been concerned in tho&s;e wicked de&s;igns might be puni&s;hed; and if they were found to be fal&s;e, that tho&s;e who &s;pread them about, might be cha&s;ti&s;ed. Upon this, the Hou&s;e de&s;ired that tho&s;e Lords, who had vi&s;ited the late King's Papers, would let them know, if they had met with any among them, relating to the Queen's Succe&s;&s;ion, or to the Succe&s;&s;ion of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover.</HI> Four of them were then in the Hou&s;e, only the Earl of <HI>Marlborough</HI> was ill that day, &s;o the four who were pre&s;ent &s;aid, they had found nothing, that did in any &s;ort relate to that matter, and this was confirmed by the Earl of <HI>Marlborough</HI> to &s;ome Peers, who were &s;ent by the Hou&s;e, to ask him the &s;ame que&s;tion. Upon which a Vote pa&s;t, that the&s;e Reports were fal&s;e and &s;candalous; and an Order was made for pro&s;ecuting the &s;preaders of them. Some Books had been publi&s;hed, charging the late Mini&s;try, and the whole Whig Party with the like de&s;igns: The&s;e Books were cen&s;ured, and the Authors of them were or|dered to be pro&s;ecuted; tho' both the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Normanby</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> did all they could to excu&s;e tho&s;e Wri|ters. When the fal&s;hood of tho&s;e Calumnies was apparent, then it was given out, with an unu&s;ual confidence, that no &s;uch Re|ports had been ever &s;et about; tho' the contrary was evident, and the thing was boldly a&s;&s;erted in tho&s;e Books: So that a pe|culiar mea&s;ure of a&s;&s;urance was nece&s;&s;ary, to face down a thing, which they had taken &s;uch pains to infu&s;e into the minds of the credulous Vulgar, all <HI>England</HI> over. The Earl of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> to divert this Enquiry, moved, that another might be made into tho&s;e Books, in which the Murder of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t was ju&s;tified; tho' the provocation given to &s;ome of the&s;e, was, by a Sermon preached by Dr. <HI>Binks</HI> before the Convocation, on the 30th of <HI>January,</HI> in which he drew a Parallel between King <HI>Charles</HI>'s Sufferings and tho&s;e of our Saviour: and, in &s;ome very indecent Expre&s;&s;ions, gave the preference to the former. When
<PB N="317" REF="337">
the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament was all done, the Queen di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them, with thanks for the money they had given, re|commending earne&s;tly to them a good agreement among them|&s;elves, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia|ment is di&s;|&s;olved.</NOTE> a&s;&s;uring them, that as on the one hand &s;he would main|tain the Toleration, &s;o on the other hand, her own principles would oblige her, to have a particular regard to tho&s;e, who ex|pre&s;&s;ed the true&s;t zeal for the Church of <HI>England:</HI> Thus the Se&s;&s;ion ended, and the Proclamation di&s;&s;olving the Parliament, with the Writs for a new one, came out not long after.</P>
<P>During &s;ome part of this Parliament, a Convocation &s;ate: <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Convoca|tion &s;ate.</NOTE> The Faction rai&s;ed, in the Lower Hou&s;e, had &s;till the Majo|rity; Several Books were writ to &s;hew, that by our Con&s;titu|tion, the power of Adjourning was wholly in the Archbi&s;hop: The Original Book of the Convocation, that &s;ate in the year 1661, being happily found, it &s;hewed the practice of that Convocation agreed with the Bi&s;hops in every particular: But tho' it was com|municated to the Lower Hou&s;e, that had no effect on them; for when Parties are once formed, and a re&s;olution is taken up on other con&s;iderations, no Evidence can convince tho&s;e, who have before hand re&s;olved to &s;tick to their point. But the Prolocutor dying, and the King's Death following, the Convocation was by that di&s;&s;olved: &s;ince in the Act, that empowered the Parliament to &s;it after the King's Death, no provi&s;ion was made to continue the Convocation. The Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> moved in the Hou&s;e of Lords, that it might be con&s;idered, whether the Convocation was not a part of the Parliament, and whether it was not continued, in con&s;equence of the Act, that continued the Parliament: But that was &s;oon let fall, for the Judges were all of Opinion, that it was di&s;&s;olved by the King's Death.</P>
<P>Upon the Queen's Acce&s;&s;ion to the Crown, all the&s;e angry men, that had rai&s;ed this flame in the Church, as they treated the Me|mory of the late King with much indecent contempt, &s;o they &s;eemed very confident, that for the future, all Preferments &s;hould be di&s;tributed among them (the Queen having &s;uper&s;eded the Commi&s;&s;ion for Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Preferments) and they thought they were full of merit, and were as full of hopes.</P>
<P>Such an evil &s;pirit as is now &s;pread among the Clergy, would <NOTE PLACE="marg">Societies for Reforma|tion.</NOTE> be a &s;ad &s;peculation at any time, but in our pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, when we are near &s;o great a cri&s;is, it is a dreadful thing: But a little to ballance this, I &s;hall give an account of more promi&s;ing beginnings and appearances, which tho' they are of an elder date, yet of late they have been brought into a more regulated form. In King <HI>James</HI>'s Reign, the fear of Popery was &s;o &s;trong, as well as ju&s;t, that many, in and about <HI>London,</HI> began to meet often together, both for Devotion, and for their further In&s;truction:
<PB N="318" REF="338">
Things of that kind had been formerly practi&s;ed, only among the Puritans and the Di&s;&s;enters: But the&s;e were of the Church, and came to their Mini&s;ters, to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted with Forms of Prayer and other directions: They were chiefly conducted by Dr. <HI>Beve|ridge</HI> and Dr. <HI>Horneck.</HI> Some di&s;liked this, and were afraid it might be the Original of new Factions and Parties; but wi&s;er and better men thought, it was not fit nor decent to check a &s;pi|rit of Devotion, at &s;uch a time: It might have given &s;candal, and it &s;eemed a di&s;couraging of piety, and might be a mean to drive well-meaning per&s;ons over to the Di&s;&s;enters. After the Revolu|tion, the&s;e Societies grew more numerous, and for a greater en|couragement to Devotion, they got &s;uch Collections to be made, as maintained many Clergymen to read Prayers in &s;o many places, and at &s;o many different hours, that devout per&s;ons might have that comfort, at every hour of the day: There were con&s;tant Sa|craments every Lord's Day in many Churches: There were both greater numbers and greater appearances of Devotion at Prayers and Sacraments, than had been ob&s;erved in the memory of Man. The&s;e Societies re&s;olved, to inform the Magi&s;trates of Swearers, Drunkards, Profaners of the Lord's Day, and of Lewd Hou&s;es; and they threw in the part of the Fine, given by Law to Inform|ers, into a &s;tock of Charity: From this, they were called Societies of Reformation: Some good Magi&s;trates encouraged them; but others treated them roughly. As &s;oon as the late Queen heard of this, &s;he did, by her Letters and Proclamations, encourage the&s;e good de&s;igns, which were afterwards pro&s;ecuted by the late King. Other Societies &s;et them&s;elves to rai&s;e Charity Schools, for teaching poor Children, for cloathing them and binding them out to Trades; Many Books were printed, and &s;ent over the Nation by them, to be freely di&s;tributed: The&s;e were called Societies for propagating Chri&s;tian Knowledge: By this means, &s;ome thou|&s;ands of Children are now well educated and carefully looked after. In many places of the Nation, the Clergy met often to|gether, to confer about matters of Religion and Learning; and they got Libraries to be rai&s;ed for their common u&s;e. At la&s;t a Corporation was created by the late King, for propagating the Go&s;pel among Infidels, for &s;ettling Schools in our Plantations, for furni&s;hing the Clergy that were &s;ent thither, and for &s;ending Mi&s;&s;ionaries among &s;uch of our Plantations, as were not able to provide Pa&s;tors for them&s;elves. It was a glorious conclu&s;ion of a Reign, that was begun with pre&s;erving our Religion, thus to create a Corporation, for propagating it to the remoter parts of the Earth, and among Infidels: There were very liberal Sub|&s;criptions made to it, by many of the Bi&s;hops and Clergy, who &s;et about it with great care and zeal: Upon the Queen's
<PB N="319" REF="339">
Acce&s;&s;ion to the Crown, they had all po&s;&s;ible a&s;&s;urances of her favour and protection, of which upon every application, they re|ceived very eminent marks.</P>
<P>The Affairs of <HI>Scotland</HI> began to be &s;omewhat embroiled: By <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> an Act made &s;oon after the Revolution, it was provided, that all Princes &s;ucceeding to the Crown, &s;hould take the Coronation Oath, before they enter'd upon their Regal Dignity; but no di|rection was given, concerning tho&s;e who &s;hould tender it, or the manner in which it &s;hould be taken: So this being left undeter|mined, the Queen called together all the late King's Mini&s;ters for that Kingdom, and in the pre&s;ence of about twelve of them, &s;he took the Coronation Oath: Men, who were di&s;po&s;ed to cen&s;ure every thing, &s;aid, that this ought not to be done, but in the pre|&s;ence of &s;ome, deputed for that effect, either by the Parliament, or at lea&s;t by the Privy Council of that Kingdom. Another point occa&s;ioned a more important Debate.</P>
<P>Upon the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination Plot, an Act had pa&s;&s;ed in <HI>Scotland</HI> for continuing the Parliament, that &s;hould be then in being, &s;ix months after the Death of the King, with two &s;pecial Clau&s;es in it; the fir&s;t was, that it &s;hould meet twenty days after the Death of the King: But the Queen did, by &s;everal Prorogations, conti|nue the Parliament almo&s;t three months after the King's Death, before it was opened; Some &s;aid the Parliament was by this di&s;|&s;olved, &s;ince it did not meet upon the day, limited by the Act to continue it; but there was another Provi&s;o in the Act, that &s;aved to the Crown the full Prerogative of adjourning or di&s;|&s;olving it within that time; yet in oppo&s;ition to that, it was ac|knowledged, that as to all &s;ub&s;equent days of Meeting, the Prero|gative was entire, but the day that was limited, that is the twen|ty fir&s;t after the King's Death, &s;eemed to be fixed for the fir&s;t opening the Se&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Clau&s;e was, a limitation on the Power of the Par|liament, during their &s;itting, that it &s;hould not extend to the re|pealing Laws; they were empowered only, to maintain the Pro|te&s;tant Religion, and the publick peace of the Country: It was therefore &s;aid, that the Queen was peaceably obeyed, and the Country now in full quiet, &s;o there was no need of a&s;&s;embling the Parliament: The end of the Law being compa&s;&s;ed, it was &s;aid, the Law fell of it &s;elf, and therefore it was nece&s;&s;ary to call a new Parliament: for the old one, if a&s;&s;embled, could have no Authority, but to &s;ee to the pre&s;ervation of Religion, and the peace of the Country, their power being limited to tho&s;e two heads, by the Act that authorized their &s;itting. In oppo&s;ition to this, it was &s;aid, that the Act which gave them Authority to &s;it as a Par|liament for &s;ix months, gave them the full Authority of a Parlia|ment:
<PB N="320" REF="340">
the directing them to take care of &s;ome more important matters, did not hinder their meddling with other matters, &s;ince no Parliament can limit a &s;ub&s;equent one: It was al&s;o &s;aid, that, &s;ince the Queen was now engaged in a War, the pub|lick Peace could not be &s;ecured, without &s;uch a Force and &s;uch Taxes to maintain it, as the pre&s;ent &s;tate of Affairs required. The Duke of <HI>Queensbury,</HI> and his Party, were for continuing the Par|liament: But Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> and the others, who had oppo&s;ed that Duke in the la&s;t Parliament, complained highly of this way of proceeding: They &s;aid, they could not acknowledge this to be a legal Parliament, they could not &s;ubmit to it, but mu&s;t pro|te&s;t again&s;t it: This was ominous; a Reign was to be begun with a Parliament, liable to a di&s;pute; and from &s;uch a breach, it was ea&s;y to fore&s;ee a train of mi&s;chief likely to follow. The&s;e Lords came up, and repre&s;ented to the Queen, and tho&s;e in fa|vour with her, their exceptions to all, that was intended to be done; every thing they &s;aid was heard very calmly; but the Queen was a &s;tranger to their Laws, and could not take it upon her to judge of them, &s;o &s;he was determined by the Advice of the Privy Council of that Kingdom. The Lords that came up to oppo&s;e the Duke of <HI>Queensbury,</HI> continued to pre&s;s for a new Parliament, in which they promi&s;ed to give the Queen all that &s;he could ask of them, and to con&s;ent to an Act of Indemnity, for all that was pa&s;t in the former Reign; But it was thought, that the Nation was then in too great a heat to venture on that; and that &s;ome more time was nece&s;&s;ary, to prepare matters, as well as mens minds, before a new Parliament &s;hould be &s;ummoned. Both Parties went down, and both being very &s;en&s;ible that the Presby|terian Intere&s;t would, with its weight, turn that &s;cale, into which it &s;hould fall; Great pains were taken by both &s;ides to gain that Party. On the one hand, they were made to apprehend, what a madne&s;s it would be for them, to provoke the Queen in the be|ginning of her Reign, who might be enough di&s;po&s;ed to entertain prejudices again&s;t them: the&s;e would be much heightened, if in a point, in which Con&s;cience could not be pretended, they &s;hould engage in a Faction again&s;t her, e&s;pecially when they could not &s;ay, that any cau&s;e of jealou&s;y was given: on the contrary, the Queen had, in all her publick Letters, promi&s;ed to maintain Pres|byterian Government; and tho' that gave great offence, in the late King's time, when tho&s;e publick Letters were printed, yet now this pa&s;t without cen&s;ure. The other Party was as bu&s;y to in|flame them; They told them the Queen was certainly in her heart again&s;t them: All tho&s;e who were now in her confidence, the Earls of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Nottingham</HI> in particular, were ene|mies to Presbyterian Government: Good words were now given
<PB N="321" REF="341">
them, to &s;eparate them from a national Intere&s;t, knowing well, that if they went off from that, and &s;o lo&s;t the hearts of the Nation, they lo&s;t that, in which their chief &s;trength lay: The Party that now governed, as &s;oon as they &s;hould have carried the pre&s;ent point by their help, and render'd them odious, by their concur|ring in it, would &s;trengthen them&s;elves at Court, by entering into the Epi&s;copal Intere&s;t, and trying to introduce Epi&s;copacy into <HI>Scotland:</HI> which would be &s;oon brought about, if the Presbyte|rians &s;hould once lo&s;e their popularity: The&s;e were the methods and rea&s;onings that were u&s;ed on both hands.</P>
<P>The Parliament was brought together on the <HI>9th</HI> of <HI>June;</HI> at <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament there.</NOTE> the opening the Se&s;&s;ion, Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> read a Paper, importing, that this was not a legal Parliament, &s;ince the only ends, for which they were empowered to meet, were already obtained; The Queen was obeyed, Religion was &s;ecured, and the Peace of the Country was &s;ettled: &s;o there &s;eemed to be no occa&s;ion for their continuance; Upon which he and &s;eventy four more withdrew; but one hundred and twelve Members continued to &s;it, and voted them&s;elves to be a free and legal Parliament, and declared, that pur&s;uant to their ancient Laws, it was High Trea&s;on to impugn their Authority. They ratified all Acts made, in favour of Presbyterian Government, in which they proceeded with &s;uch vio|lence, that Sir <HI>Alexander Bruce</HI> moving, that all tho&s;e Acts might be read, for he believed &s;ome of them might be found incon&s;i&s;|tent with Monarchy, he was for that expelled the Hou&s;e. They by one Act recognized the Queen's Title; by another, they em|powered her to name Commi&s;&s;ioners to treat of the Union of the Two Kingdoms; and by a third, they gave a Tax &s;ufficient to keep up the Force, that was then in <HI>Scotland,</HI> for two years lon|ger: and &s;o the Parliament was brought to a quiet conclu&s;ion.</P>

<P>Thus all the North of <HI>Germany</HI> was united, and ready to de|clare <NOTE PLACE="marg">The War in <HI>Poland.</HI></NOTE> again&s;t <HI>France;</HI> only the War in <HI>Poland</HI> was &s;o near them, that they were obliged to continue armed, and &s;ee the i&s;&s;ue of that War: The King of <HI>Sweden</HI> was engaged in it, with &s;uch a determined oppo&s;ition to King <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> that there was no hope of treating a Peace, tho' it was endeavoured both by <HI>England</HI> and the <HI>States:</HI> The King of <HI>Sweden</HI> &s;eemed to have accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to fatigue and danger, &s;o that he grew to love both; and tho' the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> had fallen upon the Frontiers of <HI>Sweden,</HI> where they had gained &s;ome advantages, yet even that could not divert him from carrying on the War in <HI>Poland.</HI> A Diet was &s;ummon|ed there, but it broke up in confu&s;ion, without coming to any conclu&s;ion, only they &s;ent Amba&s;&s;adors to the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> to treat of a Peace. The King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> was very apprehen&s;ive of the con&s;equences of this War, which was now in the neighbour|hood of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia;</HI> and the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> threaten'd to invade <HI>Saxony,</HI> with the Troops that he had in <HI>Pomerania,</HI> which could not be done, but thro' his Territories. The King of <HI>Sweden</HI> de|lay'd giving Audience to the Amba&s;&s;adors of <HI>Poland;</HI> and march|ed on to <HI>War&s;aw;</HI> &s;o the King of <HI>Poland</HI> retired to <HI>Cracow,</HI> and &s;ummoned tho&s;e Palatines, who adhered to him, to come about him: When the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> came to <HI>War&s;aw,</HI> he &s;ent to the Cardinal to &s;ummon a Diet, for choo&s;ing a new King: This went further than the re&s;entments of the <HI>Poles</HI> yet carried them: But the re&s;t of this matter will appear hereafter.</P>
<P>All <HI>Germany</HI> was now united, only the two Brothers of <HI>Bava|ria;</HI> The Court of <HI>Vienna</HI> &s;et on foot &s;everal Negotiations with <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Treaty with the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bavaria.</HI></NOTE> the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> but all to no purpo&s;e: for that Elector

The Pope pre|tended he would keep the Neutrality of a common Father, but his partiality to the <HI>French</HI> appeared on many occa&s;ions: yet the Court of <HI>Vienna</HI> had that veneration for the See, that they con|tented them&s;elves with expo&s;tulating, without carrying their re|&s;entments further.

<P>The Prince of <HI>Baden</HI> drew together the Troops of the Empire; <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Siege of <HI>Landaw.</HI></NOTE> he began with blocking up <HI>Landaw,</HI> and that was &s;oon turned to a Siege: <HI>Catinat</HI> was &s;ent to Command the <HI>French</HI> Army in <HI>Al&s;ace,</HI> but it was &s;o weak, that he was not able to make head with it. In the end of <HI>April,</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> formed three Armies; one under the Prince of <HI>Na&s;&s;aw,</HI> undertook the Siege of <HI>Kei&s;er|wert;</HI> Another was commanded by the Earl of <HI>Athlone,</HI> and lay in the Dutchy of <HI>Cleve,</HI> to cover the Siege; A third commanded by <HI>Cohorn,</HI> broke into <HI>Flanders,</HI> and put a great part of that Country under Contribution.

<PB N="324" REF="344">
came down po&s;t from <HI>Paris,</HI> to Command it: The <HI>States</HI> ap|prehended, that &s;o great a Prince would, at his fir&s;t appearance, undertake &s;omewhat worthy of him, and thought the De&s;ign might be upon <HI>Mae&s;tricht:</HI> &s;o they put twelve thou&s;and Men in Garri&s;on there: The Auxiliary Troops from <HI>Germany</HI> did not come &s;o &s;oon as was expected, and cro&s;s Winds &s;topt a great part of our Army: So that the Earl of <HI>Athlone</HI> was not &s;trong enough to enter into action with Mare&s;chal <HI>Bouflers:</HI> but he lay about <HI>Cleve,</HI> watching his motions. The Siege of <HI>Kei&s;erwert</HI> went on &s;lowly: the <HI>Rhine</HI> &s;welling very high, &s;o filled their Trenches, that they could not work in them. Mare&s;chal <HI>Tallard</HI> was &s;ent to lie on the other of &s;ide the <HI>Rhine,</HI> to cannonade the Be&s;ieg|ers, and to &s;end fre&s;h Men into the Town: The King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> came to <HI>Wezel,</HI> from whence he furni&s;hed the Be&s;iegers with all that was nece&s;&s;ary: There was one vigorous Attack made, in which many were killed on both &s;ides; In conclu&s;ion, after a brave defence, the Counter&s;carp was carried, and then the Twon capitulated, and was rai&s;ed according to agreement. When the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Kei&s;erwert</HI> taken.</NOTE> Duke of <HI>Burgundy</HI> &s;aw, that the Siege could not be rai&s;ed, he tried to get between the Earl of <HI>Athlone</HI> and <HI>Nimeguen:</HI> The De|&s;ign was well laid, and wanted little of being punctually executed: It mu&s;t have had fatal effects, had it &s;ucceeded: for the <HI>French</HI> would either have got into <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> or have forced the Earl of <HI>Athlone</HI> to fight at a great di&s;advantage. But the Earl of <HI>Athlone</HI> &s;o carefully watched their motions, that he got be|fore them, under the Cannon of <HI>Nimeguen;</HI> yet by this means, he was forced to abandon <HI>Cleve.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> di&s;charged their fury upon that Town, and on the Park, and all the delicious Walks of that charming place, little to the Honour of the Prince who commanded the Army: for upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, Princes are apt to be civil to one another, and not to make havock of &s;uch embelli&s;hments as can be of no u&s;e to them. The Earl of <HI>Athlone</HI>'s conduct on this occa&s;ion, rai&s;ed his credit, as much as it &s;unk <HI>Bouflers,</HI> who, tho' he had the &s;uperior Army, animated by the pre&s;ence of &s;o great a Prince, yet was able to do nothing; but was un&s;ucce&s;sful in every thing that he de&s;igned; and his Parties, that at any time were engaged with tho&s;e of the Earl of <HI>Athlone,</HI> were beaten almo&s;t in every Action.</P>
<P>Soon after this, the Earl of <HI>Marlborough</HI> came over, and took <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earl of <HI>Marlbo+rough</HI> com|mands the Army.</NOTE> the Command of the Army.

The
<PB N="325" REF="345">
Earl of <HI>Athlone</HI> was always inclined to cautious and &s;ure, but feeble Coun&s;els: But the Earl of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> when the Army was brought together, finding his Force &s;uperior to the Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Mae&s;e</HI> at the <HI>Grave,</HI> and marched up to the <HI>French;</HI> they retired as he advanced: this made him for ventur|ing on a deci&s;ive Action, but the <HI>Dutch</HI> apprehended the put|ting things to &s;uch a hazard, and would not con&s;ent to it. The Pen&s;ioner; and tho&s;e who ordered matters at the <HI>Hague,</HI> pro|ceeded the more timorou&s;ly, becau&s;e, upon the King's Death, tho&s;e who had always oppo&s;ed him, were beginning to form Parties, in &s;everal of their Towns, and were de&s;igning a change of Go|vernment: So that a publick misfortune in their conduct, would have given great advantages to tho&s;e who were watching for them. The Pen&s;ioner was particularly aimed at: this made him more unwilling to run any ri&s;que. Good Judges thought, that if the Earl of <HI>Marlborough</HI>'s Advices had been followed, matters might have been brought to a happy deci&s;ion: But as he conducted the Army prudently, &s;o he was careful not to take too much upon him. The Duke of <HI>Burgundy</HI> finding him&s;elf obliged to retreat, as the Confederate Army advanced, thought this was not &s;uitable to his dignity; So he left the Army, and ended his fir&s;t Cam|paign very ingloriou&s;ly; and it &s;eems, the King was not &s;atisfied with Mare&s;chal <HI>Bouflers,</HI> for he never commanded their Armies &s;ince that time. The Earl of <HI>Marlborough</HI> went on, taking &s;eve|ral places, which made little or no re&s;i&s;tance; and &s;eeing that Mare&s;chal <HI>Bouflers</HI> kept at a &s;afe di&s;tance, &s;o that there was no hope of an engagement with him, he re&s;olved to fall into the <HI>Spa|ni&s;h Guelder:</HI> he began with <HI>Venlo.</HI> There was a Fort on the other &s;ide of the River, that commanded it, which was taken by the Lord <HI>Cutts,</HI> in &s;o gallant a manner, that it de&s;erved to be much commended by every body but him&s;elf: but he lo&s;t the honour, that was due to many brave Actions of his, by talking too much of them: The young Earl of <HI>Huntington</HI> &s;hewed upon this, as upon many other occa&s;ions, an extraordinary heat of Courage: He called to the Soldiers, who had got over the palli&s;adoes, to help him over, and promi&s;ed them all the money he had about him, which he performed very generou&s;ly, and led them on with much bravery and &s;ucce&s;s: Upon the Fort's being taken, the Town capitulated. <HI>Ruremonde</HI> and <HI>Stevenzwert</HI> were taken in a few days after; for Mare&s;chal <HI>Bouflers</HI> did not come to their relief. Upon the&s;e Succe&s;&s;es, that came quicker than was expected, the Earl of <HI>Marlborough</HI> advanced to <HI>Liege,</HI> which was a place of more importance, in which he might put a great part of his Ar|my in Winter Quarters: The Town quickly capitulated; The Cittadel was carried by &s;torm, and another Fort in the Town
<PB N="326" REF="346">
likewi&s;e &s;urrender'd. Here was a very pro&s;perous Campaign: many places were taken with little re&s;i&s;tance, and an incon&s;ide|rable lo&s;s, either of time or of men. The Earl of <HI>Marlborough</HI>'s conduct and deportment gained him the hearts of the Army: The <HI>States</HI> were highly &s;atisfied with every thing he did, and the Earl of <HI>Athlone</HI> did him the ju&s;tice to own, that he had differed in opinion from him in every thing that was done: and that therefore the Honour of their Succe&s;s was wholly owing to him.</P>
<P>The Campaign was kept open till <HI>November,</HI> and at the end <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earl of <HI>Marlbo|rough</HI> taken, by a Party of the <HI>French,</HI> got out of their hands.</NOTE> of it, an accident happened, that had almo&s;t lo&s;t the advan|tages and honour got in it. The Earl of <HI>Marlborough</HI> thought the ea&s;ie&s;t and quicke&s;t, as well as the &s;afe&s;t way of returning to the <HI>Hague,</HI> was by &s;ome of tho&s;e great Boats, that pa&s;s on the <HI>Mae&s;e:</HI> There was one Company in the Boat in which he went, and two Companies went in another, that was to be before him: There were al&s;o &s;ome Troops ordered, to ride along the Banks for their Guard. The great Boat that went before, &s;ailed away too quick, and the Hor&s;e mi&s;took their way in the night: The <HI>French</HI> had yet the Town of <HI>Guelder</HI> in their hands, which was indeed all they had of the <HI>Spani&s;h Guelder:</HI> A Party from thence was lying on the Banks of the River, waiting for an Adventure, and they &s;eized this Boat, the whole Company being fa&s;t a&s;leep: &s;o they had now both the Earl of <HI>Marlborough</HI> and <HI>Opdam,</HI> one of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Generals, and <HI>Gueldermal&s;en,</HI> one of the States Deputies in their hands: They did not know the Earl of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> but they knew the other two. They both had Pa&s;&s;es, according to a Civility, u&s;ually practi&s;ed among the Generals of both &s;ides. The Earl of <HI>Marlborough</HI>'s Brother had a Pa&s;s, but his ill health made him leave the Campaign, &s;o his Pa&s;s was left with his Brother's Se|cretary, and that was now made u&s;e of for him&s;elf. 'Tis true, the Date of the Pa&s;s was out, but they being in ha&s;te, and in the night, that was not con&s;idered: The Boat was rifled, and they took Pre|&s;ents from tho&s;e, who they believed were protected by their Pa&s;|&s;es: So, after a &s;top of &s;ome hours, they were let go, and happily e&s;caped the danger. The news of their being taken got before them to the <HI>Hague;</HI> upon which the <HI>States</HI> immediately met, under no &s;mall con&s;ternation: They &s;ent Orders to all their Forces, to march immediately to <HI>Guelder,</HI> and to threaten the Gar|ri&s;on with all extremities, unle&s;s they &s;hould deliver the Pri&s;oners: and never to leave the Place, till they had either taken it, or had the Generals delivered to them. But before the&s;e Orders could be di&s;patched, the Earl of <HI>Marlborough</HI> came to the <HI>Hague,</HI> where he was received with inexpre&s;&s;ible joy, not only by the <HI>States,</HI> but by all the Inhabitants: for he was beloved there to a high de|gree: Soon after his return to <HI>England,</HI> the Queen made him

Duke of <HI>Marlborough;</HI> and both Hou&s;es of Parliament &s;ent &s;ome of their number to him, with their Thanks for the great &s;ervices he had done this Campaign.</P>
<P>The Campaign likewi&s;e ended happily on the Upper <HI>Rhine:</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Landaw</HI> was taken.</NOTE> <HI>Landaw</HI> was taken after a long Siege; The King of the <HI>Romans</HI> came in time to have the honour of taking it: But with &s;o great a train, and &s;o &s;plendid an equipage, that the expence of it put all the Emperor's Affairs in great di&s;order: the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary things being neglected, while a needle&s;s piece of Pomp devoured &s;o great a part of their Trea&s;ure; The Siege was &s;topt &s;ome weeks for want of Ammunition, but in conclu&s;ion, the place was taken.</P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;ities of the King of <HI>France</HI>'s Affairs, forced him at this time, to grant the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> all his demands: It is not yet known what they were; But the Court of <HI>France</HI> did not agree to what he asked, till <HI>Landaw</HI> was given for lo&s;t: and then &s;eeing that the Prince of <HI>Baden</HI> might have over-run all the <HI>Hon|druck,</HI> and carried his Winter Quarters into the neighbourhood of <HI>France;</HI> it was nece&s;&s;ary to gain this Elector on any terms: If this agreement had been &s;ooner made, probably the Siege, how far &s;oever it was advanced, mu&s;t have been rai&s;ed. The Elector <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> declares for <HI>France.</HI></NOTE> made his Declaration, when he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of <HI>Ulm,</HI> which was a rich free Town of the Empire: It was taken by a ftrata|gem, that, how &s;ucce&s;sful &s;oever it proved to the Elector, was fa|tal to him who conducted it: for he was killed by an accident, after he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Town. This gave a great alarm to the neighbouring Circles and Princes, who called away their Troops from the Prince of <HI>Baden,</HI> to their own defence; by this means, his Army was much dimini&s;hed; but with the Troops that were left him, he &s;tudied to cut off the Communication be|tween <HI>Strazbourg</HI> and <HI>Ulm.</HI> The Emperor with the Diet, pro|ceeded according to their forms again&s;t the Elector; But he was now engaged, and continued firm to the Intere&s;ts of <HI>France.</HI> Mare&s;chal <HI>Villars,</HI> who commanded the <HI>French</HI> Army in <HI>Al&s;atia,</HI> had Orders to break thro' the Black Fore&s;t, and join the <HI>Bavari|ans:</HI> His Army was much &s;uperior to the Prince of <HI>Baden;</HI> but the latter had &s;o po&s;ted him&s;elf, that after an un&s;ucce&s;sful at|tempt, <HI>Villars</HI> was forced to return to <HI>Strazbourg.</HI></P>

<PB N="328" REF="348">
he was forced to abandon a great many places, but apprehending that <HI>Ber&s;ello</HI> might be be&s;ieged, and con&s;idering the importance of that place, he put a &s;trong Garri&s;on in it. He complained much, that the Court of <HI>Vienna</HI> &s;eemed to forget him; and did not &s;end him the Reinforcements they had promi&s;ed: It was thought, that his Enemies at that Court, under colour of &s;upport|ing the King of the <HI>Romans</HI> in his fir&s;t Campaign, were willing to neglect every thing that related to him: by this means, the be&s;t Army the Emperor ever had, was left to moulder away to nothing.</P>
<P>King <HI>Philip</HI> took a very extraordinary re&s;olution of going over to <HI>Italy,</HI> to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of the Kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> and to put <NOTE PLACE="marg">King <HI>Phi|lip</HI> went to <HI>Italy.</HI></NOTE> an end to the War in <HI>Lombardy;</HI> he was received at <HI>Naples</HI> with outward &s;plendor, but he made little progre&s;s, in quieting the minds of that unruly Kingdom: He did not obtain the Inve&s;ti|ture of it from the Pope, tho' he &s;ent him a Cardinal Legate, with a high Complement: The <HI>Germans</HI> thought this was too much, while the <HI>French</HI> thought it was not enough; yet upon it, the Emperor's Amba&s;&s;ador left <HI>Rome.</HI> King <HI>Philip</HI> was conducted from <HI>Naples</HI> to <HI>Final</HI> by the <HI>French</HI> Fleet, that had carried him from <HI>Barcelona</HI> to <HI>Naples.</HI> As he was going to Command the Duke of <HI>Vendome</HI>'s Army, he was met by the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> of whom there was &s;ome jealou&s;y, that, having married his two Daughters &s;o greatly, he began now to di&s;cern his own di&s;tinct intere&s;t, which called upon him to hinder the <HI>French</HI> from being Ma&s;ters of the <HI>Milaneze.</HI> King <HI>Philip</HI> wrote to the Duke of <HI>Vendome,</HI> not to fight Prince <HI>Eugene,</HI> till he could join him: He &s;eemed jealous, lea&s;t that Prince &s;hould be driven out of <HI>Ita|ly,</HI> before he could come to &s;hare in the Honour of it; yet when he came, he could do nothing, though Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> was mi&s;e|rably abandoned by the Court of <HI>Vienna.</HI> Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> Pre|&s;ident of the Council of War, was much &s;u&s;pected, as corrupted by <HI>France:</HI> The Supplies promi&s;ed, were not &s;ent into <HI>Italy:</HI> The apprehen&s;ions they were under of the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI>'s declaring, &s;ome time before he did it, gave a colour to tho&s;e, who were jealous of Prince <HI>Eugene</HI>'s Glory, to detain the Recruits and Troops that had been promi&s;ed to him, for the Emperor's own defence: But tho' he was thus for&s;aken, yet he managed the Force he had about him, with great skill and conduct.

he had in that engagement, much further. The ill &s;tate of his Af|fairs forced him upon that de&s;perate action, in which he &s;ucceeded beyond expectation; It put the <HI>French</HI> to &s;uch a &s;tand, that all they could do after this, was only to take <HI>Luzara,</HI> and &s;ome other incon|&s;iderable places; but Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> &s;till kept his Po&s;ts.

<P>The Court of <HI>France</HI> was in a management with the Cardinal <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in <HI>Poland.</HI></NOTE> Primate of <HI>Poland,</HI> to keep that Kingdom &s;till embroiled: The King of <HI>Sweden</HI> marched on to <HI>Cracow,</HI> which was much cen&s;ured, as a de&s;perate attempt, &s;ince a defeat there mu&s;t have de&s;troyed him and his Army entirely, being &s;o far from home. He attackt the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and gave him &s;uch an Overthrow, that tho' the Army got off, he carried both their Camp and Artillery. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of <HI>Cracow,</HI> where he &s;tay'd &s;ome Months, till he had rai&s;ed all the money they could produce: and tho' the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> with the <HI>Li|thuanians</HI> de&s;troyed <HI>Livonia,</HI> and broke into <HI>Sweden,</HI> yet that could not call him back. The Duke of <HI>Hol&s;tein,</HI> who had married his elde&s;t Si&s;ter, was thought to be gained by the <HI>French,</HI> to pu&s;h on this young King, to pro&s;ecute the War with &s;uch an unrelenting fury, in which he might have a de&s;ign for him&s;elf, &s;ince the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>'s ven|turing his own per&s;on &s;o freely, might make way for his Dutche&s;s to &s;ucceed to the Crown. That Duke was killed in the battle of <HI>Cracow.</HI> There was &s;ome hopes of Peace this Winter, but the two Princes were &s;o exa&s;perated again&s;t one another, that it &s;eemed impo&s;&s;ible to compo&s;e that animo&s;ity: This was very unacceptable to the Allies: for both Kings were well inclined to &s;upport the Confederacy, and to engage in the War again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> if their own Quarrels could have been made up. The King of <HI>Sweden</HI> continued &s;till &s;o vertuous and pious in his whole deportment, that he &s;eemed to be formed, to be one of the Heroes of the Reformation. This was the &s;tate of Affairs on the Continent, during this Campaign.</P>
<P>One unlooked for accident &s;prung up in <HI>France:</HI> An In&s;urrection <NOTE PLACE="marg">An In&s;urrec|tion in the <HI>Cevennes.</HI></NOTE> happened in the <HI>Cevennes</HI> in <HI>Languedoc:</HI> of which I can &s;ay nothing that is very particular, or well a&s;&s;ured. When it fir&s;t broke out, it was looked on as the effect of Oppre&s;&s;ion and De&s;pair, which would quickly end in a &s;cene of Blood: but it had a much longer conti|nuance than was expected; and it had a con&s;iderable effect on the Affairs of <HI>France;</HI> for an Army of ten or twelve thou&s;and men,
<PB N="330" REF="350">
who were de&s;igned, either for <HI>Italy</HI> or <HI>Spain,</HI> was imployed, without any immediate &s;ucce&s;s in reducing them.</P>
<P>I now change the Element, to give an account of our operations <NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet &s;ent to <HI>Cadiz.</HI></NOTE> at Sea: <HI>Rook</HI> had the Command; The Fleet put to Sea much later than we hoped for; The <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet came over, about a month be|fore ours was ready; The whole con&s;i&s;ted of fifty Ships of the Line, and a Land Army was put on board, of twelve thou&s;and men, &s;even thou&s;and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and five thou&s;and <HI>Dutch: Rook</HI> &s;poke &s;o coldly of the De&s;ign he went upon, before he &s;ailed, that tho&s;e who conver&s;ed with him, were apt to infer, that he intended to do the Enemy as little harm as po&s;&s;ible. Advice was &s;ent over from <HI>Holland,</HI> of a Fleet that &s;ailed from <HI>France,</HI> and was ordered to call in at the <HI>Groyne. Munden</HI> was recommended by <HI>Rook,</HI> to be &s;ent again&s;t this Fleet; but tho' he came up to them, with a &s;uperior Force, yet he behaved him&s;elf &s;o ill, and &s;o un&s;ucce&s;sfully, that a Council of War was ordered to &s;it on him: They indeed acquitted him, &s;ome ex|cu&s;ing them&s;elves, by &s;aying that if they had condemned him, the puni&s;hment was Death: whereas they thought his errors flowed from a want of &s;ence: &s;o that it would have been hard to condemn him, for a defect of that, which Nature had not given him. Tho&s;e who recommended him to the Imployment, &s;eemed to be more in fault. This acquittal rai&s;ed &s;uch an outcry, that the Queen ordered him to be broke. <HI>Rook,</HI> to divert the de&s;ign that he him&s;elf was to go up|on, wrote up from St. <HI>Helen</HI>'s, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet was victualled only to the middle of <HI>September;</HI> So they, being then in <HI>July,</HI> no great de&s;ign could be undertaken, when &s;o large a part of the Fleet was &s;o ill provided. When the <HI>Dutch</HI> Admiral heard of this, he &s;ent to their Amba&s;&s;ador, to complain to the Queen of this misinfor|mation: for he was victualled till the middle of <HI>December.</HI> They were for &s;ome time &s;topt by contrary Winds, accidents and pretences, many of which were thought to be &s;trained and &s;ought for: but the Wind being turned wholly favourable, after &s;ome cro&s;s Winds, which had render'd their pa&s;&s;age &s;low and tedious, they came on the <HI>12th</HI> of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> into the Bay of <HI>Cadiz. Rook</HI> had laid no di&s;po&s;ition be|fore hand, how to proceed upon his coming thither: Some days were lo&s;t on pretence of &s;eeking for intelligence: It is certain, our Court had fal&s;e accounts of the &s;tate the place was in, both with re|lation to the Garri&s;on and the Fortifications; The Garri&s;on was much &s;tronger, and the Fortifications were in a better ca&s;e, than was repre&s;ented. The <HI>French</HI> Men of War, and the Gallies that lay in the Bay, retired within the <HI>Puntals.</HI> In the fir&s;t &s;urprize, it had been ea&s;y to have followed them, and to have taken or burnt them; which <HI>Fairborn</HI> offered to execute, but <HI>Rook</HI> and the re&s;t of his creatures did not approve of this. Some days were lo&s;t, before a Council of War was called; In the mean while, the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> &s;ent &s;ome Engineers and Pilots to &s;ound the South-&s;ide of <HI>Cadiz,</HI> near

the I&s;land of St. <HI>Pedro:</HI> but while this was doing, the Officers, by the taking of &s;ome Boats, came to know, that tho&s;e of <HI>Cadiz</HI> had &s;ent over the be&s;t of their Goods and other Effects to the Port of St. <HI>Maries,</HI> an open Village over again&s;t it, on the Continent of <HI>Spain;</HI> &s;o that here was good plunder to be had ea&s;ily, whereas the Land|ing on the I&s;le of <HI>Cadiz</HI> was like to prove dangerous, and, as &s;ome made them believe, impracticable. In the Council of War, in which their In&s;tructions were read, it was propo&s;ed to con&s;ider, how they &s;hould put them in execution; <HI>Haro,</HI> one of the General Officers, made a long Speech again&s;t Landing: He &s;hewed how de&s;perate an attempt it would prove, and how different they found the &s;tate of the place, from the repre&s;entation made of it in <HI>England:</HI> The great|er number agreed with him, and all that the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> could &s;ay to the contrary was of no effect. <HI>Rook</HI> &s;eemed to be of the &s;ame mind with the Duke, but all his Dependants were of another opi|nion, &s;o this was thought to be a piece of craft in him: In conclu|&s;ion, the Council of War came to a re&s;olution, not to make a De|&s;cent on the I&s;land of <HI>Cadiz:</HI> But before they broke up, tho&s;e, whom the Duke had &s;ent to &s;ound the Landing places on the South-&s;ide, came and told them, that as they might Land &s;afely, &s;o the Ships might ride &s;ecurely on that &s;ide; yet they had no regard to this, but adhered to their former re&s;olution, nor were there any Orders given for Bombarding the Town. The Sea was for the mo&s;t part very high while they lay there, but it was &s;o calm for one day, that the Engi|neers believed they could have done much mi&s;chief; but they had no Orders for it: And indeed it appeared very evidently, that they intended to do nothing but rob St. <HI>Maries.</HI></P>
<P>A Landing on the Continent was re&s;olved on; and tho' the Sea <NOTE PLACE="marg">They landed and robbed St. <HI>Maries.</HI></NOTE> was high, and the danger great, yet the hope of &s;poil made them venture on it; they landed at <HI>Rota;</HI> a Party of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Hor&s;e &s;eem|ed to threaten &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance, but they retired, and &s;o our men came to St. <HI>Maries,</HI> which they found de&s;erted, but full of riches: Both Officers and Soldiers &s;et them&s;elves, with great courage, again&s;t this tempting but harmle&s;s enemy; Some of the General Officers &s;et a very ill example to all the re&s;t; chiefly <HI>Haro</HI> and <HI>Bella&s;is.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> tried to hinder it, but did not exert his authority; for if he had made &s;ome examples at fir&s;t, he might have prevented the mi&s;chief that was done: But the whole Army, running &s;o vio|lently on the Spoil, he either was not able, or, thro' a gentlene&s;s of temper, was not willing to proceed to extremities. He had pub|li&s;hed a Manife&s;to, according to his In&s;tructions, by which the <HI>Spa|niards</HI> were invited to &s;ubmit to the Emperor; and he offered his Protection to all that came in to him: But the Spoil of St. <HI>Maries</HI> was thought an ill Commentary on that Text. After &s;ome days of unfruitful Trials, on the Forts of that &s;ide, it appeared that no|thing could be done; &s;o about the middle of <HI>September,</HI> they all re|embarked.
<PB N="332" REF="352">
Some of the Ships Crews were &s;o imployed, in bringing and be&s;towing the Plunder, that they took not the nece&s;&s;ary care to furni&s;h them&s;elves with fre&s;h Water. <HI>Rook,</HI> without pro&s;ecuting his other in&s;tructions, in ca&s;e the de&s;ign on <HI>Cadiz</HI> mi&s;carried, gave Orders only for a Squadron to &s;ail to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> with &s;ome Land Forces; and tho' he had a Fleet of Victuallers, that had Provi&s;ions to the middle of <HI>December,</HI> he ordered them to &s;ail home; by this means, the Men of War were &s;o &s;cantily furni&s;hed, that they were &s;oon forced to be put on &s;hort allowance. Nor did <HI>Rook</HI> &s;end Advice-Boats, either to the Ports of <HI>Algarve,</HI> or to <HI>Lisbon,</HI> to &s;ee what Or|ders or Advices might be lying for him, but &s;ailed in a direct cour&s;e for <HI>England:</HI> But &s;ome Ships, not being provided with Water for the Voyage to <HI>England,</HI> touched on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Algarve,</HI> to take in Water.</P>
<P>They met with intelligence there, that the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Plate Fleet, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gal|leons put in at <HI>Vigo.</HI></NOTE> with a good Convoy of <HI>French</HI> Men of War, had put in at <HI>Vigo,</HI> a Port in <HI>Galicia,</HI> not far from <HI>Portugal;</HI> where the entrance was nar|row, and capable of a good defence. It widened within Land, into a Bay or Mouth of a River, where the Ships lay very conveniently: He who commanded the <HI>French</HI> Fleet, ordered a Boom to be laid cro&s;s the entrance, and Forts to be rai&s;ed on both &s;ides: He had not time to fini&s;h what he de&s;igned, otherwi&s;e the place had been inac|ce&s;&s;ible: But as it was, the difficulty in forcing this Port was believed to be greater, than any they would have met with, if they had landed on the I&s;le of <HI>Cadiz.</HI> As &s;oon as this Fleet had put in at <HI>Vigo; Methuen,</HI> the Queen's Mini&s;ter at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> &s;ent Adverti&s;ements of it, to all the places, where he thought our Advice-Boats might be order|ed to call: <HI>Rook</HI> had given no Orders for any to call, and &s;o held on his cour&s;e towards Cape <HI>Fini&s;terre:</HI> But one of his Captains, <HI>Har|dy,</HI> whil&s;t he water'd in <HI>Algarve,</HI> heard the news there; upon which, he made all the Sail he could after <HI>Rook,</HI> and overtook him. <HI>Rook</HI> upon that, turned his cour&s;e towards <HI>Vigo,</HI> very unwillingly as was &s;aid, and finding the Advice was true, he re&s;olved to force his way in.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> landed with a Body of the Army, and at|tack'd the Forts with great bravery, while the Ships broke the Boom, <NOTE PLACE="marg">But they were burnt or taken by the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></NOTE> and forced the Port. When the <HI>French</HI> &s;aw what was done, they left their Ships, and &s;et &s;ome of the Men of War and &s;ome of the Galleons on fire: Our Men came up with &s;uch diligence, that they &s;topt the progre&s;s of the fire, yet fifteen Men of War and eight Gal|leons were burnt or &s;unk; but our Men were in time to &s;ave five Men of War, and five Galleons, which they took. Here was a great de&s;truction made, and a great Booty taken, with very little lo&s;t on our &s;ide. One of our Ships was &s;et on fire by a Fire-Ship, but &s;he too was &s;aved, tho' with the lo&s;s of &s;ome Men; which was all the lo&s;s we &s;u&s;tained in this important Action. The Duke of <HI>Or|mond</HI> marched into the Country, and took &s;ome Forts, and the Town
<PB N="333" REF="353">
of <HI>Ritondella,</HI> where much Plunder was found; The <HI>French</HI> Sea|men and Soldiers e&s;caped, for we having no Hor&s;e, were not in a condition to pur&s;ue them: The <HI>Spaniards</HI> appeared at &s;ome di|&s;tance, in a great Body: But they did not offer to enter into any Action with the Duke of <HI>Ormond:</HI> It appeared, that the re&s;entments of that proud Nation, which was now governed by <HI>French</HI> Councils, were &s;o high, that they would not put them&s;elves in any danger, or to any Trouble, even to &s;ave their own Fleet, when it was in &s;uch hands.</P>
<P>After this great Succe&s;s, it came under con&s;ultation, whether it was not advi&s;able to leave a good Squadron of Ships, with the Land Forces, to Winter at <HI>Vigo:</HI> The Neighbourhood of <HI>Portugal</HI> made, that they could be well furni&s;hed with Provi&s;ions, and all other ne|ce&s;&s;aries from thence: This might al&s;o encourage that King to de|clare him&s;elf, when there was &s;uch a Force and Fleet lying &s;o near him: It might likewi&s;e encourage &s;uch of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> as favour|ed the Emperor, to declare them&s;elves, when they &s;aw a &s;afe place of retreat, and a Force to protect them: The Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> up|on the&s;e con&s;iderations, offered to &s;tay, if <HI>Rook</HI> would have con&s;ent|ed; but he excu&s;ed it; he had &s;ent home the Victuallers with the Stores; and &s;o he could not &s;pare what was nece&s;&s;ary, for &s;uch as would &s;tay there: and indeed, he had &s;o ordered the matter, that he could not &s;tay long enough to try, whether they could rai&s;e and &s;earch the Men of War and the Galleons that were &s;unk: He was obliged to make all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te home; and if the Wind had turn|ed to the Ea&s;t, which was ordinary in that Sea&s;on, a great part of our Ships Crews mu&s;t have died of hunger.</P>
<P>The Wind continued favourable, &s;o they got home &s;afe, but half <NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> &s;tarved. Thus ended this Expedition, which was ill projected, and wor&s;e executed. The Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> told me, he had not half the Ammunition that was nece&s;&s;ary, for the taking <HI>Cadiz,</HI> if they had defended them&s;elves well: tho' he believed they would not have made any great re&s;i&s;tance, if he had landed on his fir&s;t arri|val, and not given them time to recover from the di&s;order, into which the fir&s;t &s;urprize had put them. A great deal of the Trea|&s;ure taken at <HI>Vigo</HI> was embezzled, and fell into private hands: One of the Galleons founder'd at Sea. The Publick was not much en|riched by this extraordinary Capture, yet the lo&s;s our enemies made by it was a va&s;t one, and to compleat the ruine of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Mer|chants, their King &s;eized on the Plate, that was taken out of the Ships, upon their fir&s;t arrival at <HI>Vigo.</HI> Thus the Campaign ended; very happily for the Allies, and mo&s;t gloriou&s;ly for the Queen, who&s;e fir&s;t year, being &s;uch a continued cour&s;e of Succe&s;s, gave a hopeful pre&s;age, of what might be hereafter expected.</P>
<P>The Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament comes next to be related: The <NOTE PLACE="marg">A new $span$</NOTE> Queen did not openly interpo&s;e in the Elections, but her inclina|tion to the Tories appearing plainly, all people took it for grant|ed,
<PB N="334" REF="354">
that &s;he wi&s;hed they might be the Majority: This wrought on the incon&s;tancy and &s;ervility, that is natural to multitudes: and the conceit, which had been infu&s;ed and propagated with much Indu&s;try, that the Whigs had charged the Nation with great Taxes, of which a large &s;hare had been devoured by them&s;elves, had &s;o far turned the tide, that the Tories in the Hou&s;e of Commons were at lea&s;t double the number of the Whigs. They met full of fury again&s;t the Memory of the late King, and again&s;t tho&s;e, who had been imploy'd by him. The fir&s;t in&s;tance, wherein this appeared, was in their Addre&s;s to the Queen, congratulating her great Succe&s;|&s;es; they added, that by her wi&s;e and happy Conduct, the Honour of the Kingdom was <HI>Retrieved.</HI> The word <HI>Retrieved</HI> implying that it was formerly lo&s;t, all that had a ju&s;t regard to the King's Memo|ry oppo&s;ed it: He had carried the Honour of the Nation further, than had been done in any Reign before his: To him they owed their pre&s;ervation, their &s;afety, and even the Queen's being on the Throne; He had de&s;igned and formed that great Confederacy, at the head of which &s;he was now &s;et. In oppo&s;ition to this, it was now &s;aid, that during his Reign, things had been conducted by Stran|gers, and tru&s;ted to them; and that a va&s;t Trea&s;ure had been &s;pent in unprofitable Campaigns in <HI>Flanders.</HI> The Partition Treaty, and every thing el&s;e, with which the former Reign could be loaded, was brought into the account, and the keeping the word <HI>Retrieved,</HI> in the Addre&s;s, was carried by a great Majority; All that had favour at Court, or hoped for any, going into it. Controverted Elections were judged in favour of Tories, with &s;uch a bare-faced partiality, that it &s;hewed the Party was re&s;olved on every thing, that might &s;erve their ends.</P>
<P>Of this I &s;hall only give two In&s;tances: The one was of the Bo|rough of <HI>Hindon,</HI> near me at <HI>Salisbury,</HI> where upon a complaint of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Great par|tiality in judging E|lections.</NOTE> Bribery, the proof was &s;o full and clear, that they ordered a Bill to disfranchize the Town for that Bribery, and yet, becau&s;e the Bribes were given by a man of their Party, they would not pa&s;s a Vote on him as guilty of it: So that a Borough was voted, to lo&s;e its Right of Electing, becau&s;e many in it were guilty of a Corruption, in which no man appeared to be the Actor. The other was of more importance; and becau&s;e it may be &s;et up for a Precedent, I will be more particular in the Report: Mr. <HI>John How</HI> had been Vice-Chamberlain to the late Queen, but mi&s;&s;ing &s;ome of tho&s;e advanta|ges, that he had propo&s;ed to him&s;elf, he had gone into the highe&s;t oppo&s;ition, that was made in the Hou&s;e of Commons, to the Court, during the la&s;t Reign: not without many indecent reflections on the per&s;on of the late King; and a mo&s;t virulent attacking of all his Mini&s;ters. He was a man of &s;ome wit, but of little judgment, and of &s;mall principles of Religion: He &s;tood Knight of the Shire for <HI>Gloce&s;ter&s;hire;</HI> and had drawn a Party in that County to join
<PB N="335" REF="355">
with him in an Addre&s;s to the Queen, in which, reflections were made on the danger and ill u&s;age &s;he had gone thro' in the former Reign; this Addre&s;s was received by the Queen, in &s;o particular a manner, that it looked like the owning that the Contents of it were true; but &s;he made &s;uch an excu&s;e for this, when the offence it gave was laid before her, that probably, &s;he was not acquainted with the matter of the Addre&s;s, when &s;he &s;o received it. Upon this, great oppo&s;ition was made to his Election; When it came to the the Poll, it appeared, he had lo&s;t it; So the Sheriff was moved for a Scrutiny, to examine, whether all tho&s;e who had &s;worn, that they were Freeholders of forty Shillings a year, had &s;worn true. By the Act of Parliament, the matter was referred to the Parties Oath, and their &s;wearing fal&s;e was declared Perjury: Therefore &s;uch, as had &s;worn fal&s;ly, were liable to a Pro&s;ecution: but by all Laws, an Oath is looked upon as an end of Controver&s;y, till he who &s;wore is con|vict of Perjury: and the Sheriff, being an Officer named by the Court, if he had a power to review the Poll, this put the Election of Counties, wholly in the power of the Crown: yet upon this oc|ca&s;ion, the heat of a Party prevailed &s;o far, that they voted <HI>How</HI> duly elected.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of Commons very unanimou&s;ly, and with great di&s;|patch, <NOTE PLACE="marg">All the Sup|ply agreed to.</NOTE> agreed to all the demands of the Court, and voted all the Supplies that were nece&s;&s;ary for carrying on the War. Upon the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI>'s coming over, a new demand for an addi|tional Force was made, &s;ince the King of <HI>France</HI> had given out Commi&s;&s;ions, for a great increa&s;e of his Armies: Upon that, the <HI>States</HI> moved the Queen, for ten thou&s;and more men: This was con&s;ented to, but with a condition, which how rea&s;onable &s;oever it might be in it&s;elf, yet the manner, in which it was managed, &s;hew|ed a very ill di&s;po&s;ition towards the <HI>Dutch;</HI> and in the Debate, they were treated very indecently. It was in&s;i&s;ted on, that before the Pay of the&s;e new Troops &s;hould begin, the <HI>States</HI> &s;hould prohibit all Trade with <HI>France,</HI> and break off all Corre&s;pondence with that Kingdom. It was indeed true, that <HI>France</HI> could not have &s;uppli|ed their Armies in <HI>Italy</HI> but by the means of this &s;ecret Trade; &s;o it was rea&s;onable to break it; but the impo&s;ing it on the <HI>Dutch,</HI> in the manner in which this was pre&s;&s;ed, carried in it too high a &s;train of Authority over them. Theirs is a Country, that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts not by any intrin&s;ick Wealth of their own, but by their Trade; &s;ome &s;eem|ed to hope, that the oppo&s;ition, which would be rai&s;ed on this head, might force a Peace, at which many among us were driving &s;o in|decently, that they took little care to conceal it. The <HI>States</HI> re|&s;olved to comply with <HI>England</HI> in every thing; and tho' they did not like the manner of demanding this, yet they readily con&s;ented to it. The ordinary bu&s;ine&s;s of a Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament was &s;oon di&s;patched, no oppo&s;ition being made to the Supply, at which, in the former Reign, things &s;tuck longe&s;t.</P>

When tho&s;e matters were &s;ettled, a Bill was brought in by the Tories, again&s;t Occa&s;ional Conformity, which produced great and long Debates: By this Bill, all tho&s;e who took the Sacrament and <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Bill a|gain&s;t occa|&s;ional Con|formity.</NOTE> Te&s;t (which by the Act pa&s;&s;ed in the year 1673, was made nece&s;&s;a|ry to tho&s;e, who held Offices of Tru&s;t, or were Magi&s;trates in Cor|porations, but was only to be taken once by them) and did after that, go to the Meetings of Di&s;&s;enters, or any Meeting for Religious Wor|&s;hip, that was not according to the <HI>Liturgy</HI> or Practice of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> where five per&s;ons were pre&s;ent, more than the Family, were di&s;abled from holding their Imployments, and were to be fined in an hundred pounds, and in five pounds a day for every day, in which they continued to act in their Imployments, after their having been at any &s;uch Meeting: They were al&s;o made incapable to hold any other Imployment, till after one whole year's Conformity to the Church, which was to be proved at the Quarter Se&s;&s;ion: Upon a relap&s;e, the penalty and the time of incapacity were doubled: no limitation of time was put in the Bill, nor of the way, in which the Offence was to be proved: But whereas, the Act of the Te&s;t only included the Magi&s;trates in Corporations, all the inferior Officers or Freemen in Corporations, who were found to have &s;ome intere&s;t in the Elections, were now comprehended within this Bill. The Pre|amble of the Bill a&s;&s;erted the Toleration, and condemned all Per&s;e|cution for Con&s;cience &s;ake, in a high &s;train: Some thought the Bill was of no con&s;equence, and that, if it &s;hould pa&s;s into a Law, it would be of no effect: but that the Occa&s;ional Conformi&s;ts would become con&s;tant ones. Others thought, that this was &s;uch a break|ing in upon the Toleration, as would undermine it, and that it would have a great effect on Corporations; as indeed, the intent of it was believed to be, the modelling Elections, and by con&s;equence of the Hou&s;e of Commons.</P>
<P>On behalf of the Bill, it was &s;aid, the de&s;ign of the Te&s;t Act was, that all in Office &s;hould continue in the Communion of the Church; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Creat De|bates about it.</NOTE> that coming only once to the Sacrament for an Office, and going afterwards to the Meetings of Di&s;&s;enters, was both an cluding the in|tent of the Law, and a profanation of the Sacrament, which gave great &s;candal, and was abhorred by the better &s;ort of Di&s;&s;enters. Tho&s;e who were again&s;t the Bill, &s;aid, the Nation had been quiet ever &s;ince the Toleration, the Di&s;&s;enters had lo&s;t more ground and &s;trength by it, than the Church; The Nation was now engaged in a great War; it &s;eemed therefore unrea&s;onable, to rai&s;e animo&s;ities at home, in matters of Religion, at &s;uch a time; and to encourage a tribe of $nformers, who were the wor&s;t &s;ort of men: The Fines were exec$$$ve; higher than any laid on Papi&s;ts by Law; and &s;ince no limitation of Time, nor concurrence of Witne&s;&s;es, was provided for in the Bill, men would be for ever expo&s;ed to the malice of a bold Swearer, or wicked Servant: It was moved, that &s;ince the great|e&s;t
<PB N="337" REF="357">
danger of all was from Athei&s;ts and Papi&s;ts, that all &s;uch as re|ceived the Sacrament for an Office, &s;hould be obliged to receive it three times a year, which all were by Law required to do; and to keep to their Pari&s;h Church, at lea&s;t one Sunday a Month; but this was not admitted. All, who pleaded for the Bill, did in words de|clare for the continuance of the Toleration, yet the &s;harpne&s;s, with which they treated the Di&s;&s;enters in all their Speeches, &s;hewed as if they de&s;igned their extirpation. The Bill was carried in the Hou&s;e of Commons, by a great Majority. The Debates held longer in the Hou&s;e of Lords: Many were again&s;t it, becau&s;e of the high Penal|ties: Some remember'd the practice of Informers, in the end of King <HI>Charles</HI>'s Reign, and would not con&s;ent to the reviving &s;uch infamous methods; All believed, that the chief de&s;ign of this Bill was, to model Corporations, and to ca&s;t out of them all tho&s;e, who would not vote in Elections for Tories: The Toleration it&s;elf was vi&s;ibly aimed at, and this was only a &s;tep to break in upon it. Some thought, the de&s;ign went yet further, to rai&s;e &s;uch quarrels and di&s;tractions among us, as would &s;o embroil us at home, that our Allies might &s;ee, they could not depend upon us; and that we, being weaken'd by the di&s;orders, occa&s;ioned by tho&s;e Pro&s;ecutions, might be di&s;abled from carrying on the War, which was the chief thing driven at, by the promoters of the Bill. So that many of the Lords, as well as the Bi&s;hops, agreed in oppo&s;ing this Bill, tho' upon different views: yet they con&s;ented to &s;ome parts of it; chiefly, that &s;uch as went to Meetings, after they had received the Sacrament, &s;hould be di&s;abled from holding any Imployments, and be fined in twenty pounds; many went into this, tho' they were again&s;t every part of the Bill, becau&s;e they thought this the mo&s;t plau&s;ible way of lo&s;ing it: &s;ince the Hou&s;e of Commons had of late &s;et it up for a maxim, that the Lords could not alter the Fines, that they &s;hould fix in a Bill, this being a meddling with money, which they thought was &s;o peculiar to them, that they would not let the Lords, on any pretence, break in upon it.</P>
<P>The Lords hereupon appointed a very exact &s;earch to be made in|to all the <HI>Rolls,</HI> that lay in the Clerk of the Parliament's Office, from the middle of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh's Reign, down to the pre&s;ent time: and they found, by &s;ome hundreds of Precedents, that in &s;ome Bills the Lords began the Clau&s;es, that &s;et the Fines; and that when Fines were &s;et by the Commons, &s;ometimes they altered the Fines, and at other times, they changed the u&s;e, to which they were applied: The Report made of this was &s;o full and clear, that there was no po&s;&s;ibility of replying to it, and the Lords ordered it to be enter'd in their Books. But the Commons were re&s;olved to maintain their point, without entering into any Debate upon it. The Lords al&s;o added Clau&s;es, requiring proof to be made by two Witne&s;&s;es, and that the Information &s;hould be given in within ten days, and the
<PB N="338" REF="358">
Pro&s;ecution commenced within three months after the Fact. The Commons agreed to this, but would not alter the Penalties that they had &s;et. The thing depended long between the Two Hou&s;es; both &s;ides took pains to bring up the Lords that would vote with them, &s;o that there were above an hundred and thirty Lords in the Hou&s;e; the greate&s;t number that had ever been together.</P>
<P>The Court put their whole &s;trength to carry the Bill; Prince <HI>George,</HI> who had received the Sacrament, as Lord High Admiral, and yet kept his Chapel in the <HI>Lutheran</HI> way, &s;o that he was an oc|ca&s;ional Communicant, came and voted for the Bill: After &s;ome Conferences, wherein each Hou&s;e had yielded &s;ome &s;maller differen|ces to the other, it came to a free Conference in the Painted Cham|ber, which was the mo&s;t crowded upon that occa&s;ion, that had ever been known; &s;o much weight was laid on this matter on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>When the Lords retired, and it came to the final Vote <HI>of Adher|ing,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Two Hou&s;es di&s;|agreeing, the Bill was lo&s;t.</NOTE> the Lords were &s;o equally divided, that in three Que&s;tions, put on different heads, the <HI>Adhering</HI> was carried but by one voice in every one of them; and it was a different per&s;on that gave it in all the three Divi&s;ions. The Commons likewi&s;e <HI>adhered,</HI> &s;o the Bill was lo&s;t. This Bill &s;eemed to favour the Intere&s;ts of the Church, &s;o hot men were for it: and the greater number of the Bi&s;hops be|ing again&s;t it, they were cen&s;ured, as cold and &s;lack in the concerns of the Church: a reproach, that all moderate men mu&s;t expect, when they oppo&s;e violent motions. A great part of this fell on my &s;elf: for I bore a large &s;hare in the Debates, both in the Hou&s;e of Lords, and at the free Conference. Angry men took occa&s;ion from hence, to charge the Bi&s;hops as enemies to the Church, and betray|ers of its Intere&s;ts, becau&s;e we would not run blindfold into the pa&s;|&s;ions and de&s;igns of ill tempered men; tho' we can appeal to all the world, and which is more, to God him&s;elf, that we did faithfully and zealou&s;ly pur&s;ue the true Intere&s;ts of the Church, the promot|ing Religion and Learning, the encouraging of all good men, and good de&s;igns: and that we did apply our &s;elves to the duties of our Function, and to the work of the Go&s;pel. Having this quiet within our &s;elves, we mu&s;t bear the cro&s;s, and &s;ubmit to the will of God: The le&s;s of our Reward that we receive from men, we have &s;o much the more to look for from Him.</P>
<P>While the Bill, that had rai&s;ed &s;o much heat, was in agitation: The Queen &s;ent a Me&s;&s;age to the Commons, de&s;iring them to make <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Bill for Prince <HI>George.</HI></NOTE> &s;ome &s;uitable provi&s;ion for Prince <HI>George,</HI> in ca&s;e he &s;hould out-live her. He was many years elder than the Queen, and was troubled with an A&s;thma, that every year had ill effects on his health; it had brought him into great danger this Winter; yet the Queen thought it became her to provide for all events. <HI>How</HI> moved, that it &s;hould be an hundred thou&s;and pounds a year: This was &s;econded by tho&s;e, who knew how acceptable the Motion would be to the Queen; tho'
<PB N="339" REF="359">
it was the double of what any Queen of <HI>England</HI> ever had in Join|ture; &s;o it pa&s;&s;ed without any oppo&s;ition. But while it was pa&s;&s;ing, a motion was made upon a Clau&s;e in the Act, which limited the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Debates on a Clau&s;e that was in it.</NOTE> Succe&s;&s;ion to the <HI>Hanover</HI> Family; which provided again&s;t &s;tran|gers, tho' naturalized, being capable to hold any Imployments among us. This plainly related only to tho&s;e, who &s;hould be naturalized in a future Reign, and had no retro&s;pect to &s;uch as were already naturalized, or &s;hould be naturalized during the pre&s;ent Reign. It was however propo&s;ed as doubtful, whether when that Family might reign: all who were naturalized before &s;hould not be incapacitated by that Clau&s;e, from &s;itting in Parliament, or holding Imployments; and a Clau&s;e was offered to except the Prince, from being compre|hended in that incapacity. Again&s;t this two Objections lay; One was, that the Lords had re&s;olved by a Vote, to which the greater number had &s;et their hands, that they would never pa&s;s any Money Bill, &s;ent up to them by the Commons, to which any Clau&s;e was tacked, that was foreign to the Bill. They had done this, to pre|vent the Commons from fa&s;tning matters of a different nature to a Money Bill, and then pretending, that the Lords could not meddle with it; for this was a method to alter the Government, and bring it entirely into their own hands: By this means, when money was nece&s;&s;ary for pre&s;erving the Nation, they might force, not only the Lords, but the Crown to con&s;ent to every thing they propo&s;ed, by tacking it to a Money Bill. It was &s;aid, that a capacity for holding Imployments, and for &s;itting in the Hou&s;e of Lords, were things of a different nature from money; &s;o that this Clau&s;e &s;eemed to many to be a Tack; Whereas others thought it was no Tack, becau&s;e both parts of the Act related to the &s;ame per&s;on. The other Objection was, that this Clau&s;e &s;eemed to imply, that per&s;ons already natura|lized, and in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Rights of natural born Subjects, were to be excluded in the next Reign; tho' all people knew, that no &s;uch thing was intended, when the Act of Succe&s;&s;ion pa&s;&s;ed. Great oppo&s;ition was made, for both the&s;e rea&s;ons, to the pa&s;&s;ing this Clau&s;e; but the Queen pre&s;&s;ed it with the greate&s;t earne&s;tne&s;s, &s;he had yet &s;hewed in any thing what&s;oever; She thought it became her, as a good Wife, to have the Act pa&s;&s;ed; in which &s;he might be the more earne&s;t, becau&s;e it was not thought advi&s;able, to move for an Act, that &s;hould take Prince <HI>George,</HI> into a Con&s;ort&s;hip of the Regal Dignity. This matter rai&s;ed a great heat in the Hou&s;e of Lords: Tho&s;e, who had been advanced by the late King, and were in his Intere&s;ts, did not think it became them to con&s;ent to this, which &s;eemed to be a prejudice, or at lea&s;t, a di&s;grace to tho&s;e, whom he had rai&s;ed. The Court managed the matter &s;o dextrou&s;ly, that the Bill pa&s;&s;ed, and the Queen was highly di&s;plea&s;ed with tho&s;e, who had oppo&s;ed it, among whom I had my &s;hare. The Clau&s;e was put in the Bill, by &s;ome in the Hou&s;e of Commons, only becau&s;e
<PB N="340" REF="360">
they believed it would be oppo&s;ed by tho&s;e, again&s;t whom they in|tended to irritate the Queen.</P>
<P>Soon after this, the Commons &s;ent up a Bill, in favour of tho&s;e, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A further &s;ecurity to|the Prote&s;|tant Succe&s;|&s;ion.</NOTE> who had not taken the Oath, abjuring the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> by the day that was named; granting them a year longer to con&s;ider of it: for it was &s;aid, that the whole Party was now come entirely into the Queen's Intere&s;ts: Tho' on the other hand, it was given out, that Agents were come from <HI>France,</HI> on de&s;ign to per&s;uade all per&s;ons to take the Abjuration, that they might become capable of Imploy|ments, and &s;o might in time be a Majority in Parliament, and by that means, the Act of Succe&s;&s;ion, and the Oath impo&s;ed by it, might be repealed. When the Bill, for thus prolonging the time, was brought up to the Lords, a Clau&s;e was added, qualifying tho&s;e per&s;ons, who &s;hould in the new extent of time take the Oaths, to return to their Benefices or Imployments, unle&s;s they were already legally filled. When this was agreed, two Clau&s;es of much greater con&s;equence were added to the Bill. One was, declaring it High Trea&s;on to endeavour to defeat the Succe&s;&s;ion to the Crown, as it was now limited by Law, or to &s;et a&s;ide the next Succe&s;&s;or; This had a Precedent in the former Reign, &s;o it could not be denied now: It &s;eemed the more nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e there was another Per&s;on, who openly claimed the Crown; &s;o that a further &s;ecurity might well be in&s;i&s;ted on. This was a great &s;urprize to many, who were vi&s;ibly unea&s;y at the motion, but were not prepared for it, and did not &s;ee how it could be re&s;i&s;ted. The other Clau&s;e was, for &s;ending the Abjuration to <HI>Ireland,</HI> and obliging all there (in the &s;ame man|ner as in <HI>England)</HI> to take it: This &s;eemed the more rea&s;onable, con&s;idering the &s;trength of the Popi&s;h Intere&s;t there. Both Clau&s;es pa&s;&s;ed in the Hou&s;e of Lords, without any oppo&s;ition: but it was apprehended, that the Hou&s;e of Commons would not be &s;o ea&s;y: yet when it was &s;ent to them, they &s;truggled only again&s;t the fir&s;t Clau&s;e, that barred the return of per&s;ons, upon their taking the Oaths, into places that were already filled. The Party tried their &s;trength upon this, and upon their &s;ucce&s;s in it, they &s;eemed re&s;olved to di&s;|pute the other Clau&s;e: but it was carried, tho' only by one voice, to agree with the Lords. When the Clau&s;e, relating to the Succe&s;|&s;ion, was read; <HI>Mu&s;grave</HI> try'd if it might not be made a Bill by it &s;elf, and not put as a Clau&s;e in another Bill: but he &s;aw the Hou&s;e was re&s;olved to receive both Clau&s;es, &s;o he did not in&s;i&s;t on his mo|tion. All people were &s;urprized to &s;ee a Bill, that was begun in fa|vour of the Jacobites, turned &s;o terribly upon them; &s;ince by it, we had a new &s;ecurity given, both in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> for a Pro|te&s;tant Succe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>At this time, the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> quitted his place of Lord Lieu|tenant of <HI>Ireland:</HI> He was unea&s;y at the preference which the Duke <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> &s;aid down his Imploy|ments.</NOTE> of <HI>Marlborough</HI> had in the Queen's confidence, and at the Lord <HI>Go|dolphin</HI>'s
<PB N="341" REF="361">
being Lord Trea&s;urer. It was generally believed, he was endeavouring to embroil our Affairs, and that he was laying a train of oppo&s;ition in the Hou&s;e of Commons: The Queen &s;ent a Me&s;|&s;age to him, ordering him to make ready to go to <HI>Ireland;</HI> for it &s;eemed very &s;trange, e&s;pecially in a time of War, that a per&s;on, in &s;o great a Po&s;t, &s;hould not attend upon it: but he, after &s;ome days advi&s;ing about it, went to the Queen, and de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed from that Imployment: This was readily accepted, and upon that he withdrew from the Councils. It was immediately offered to the Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> and he was made Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> upon his fir&s;t arrival from the expedition to <HI>Cadiz,</HI> complained very openly of <HI>Rook</HI>'s Conduct, and &s;eemed re|&s;olved <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rook</HI>'s con|duct exa|mined and ju&s;tified.</NOTE> to carry the matter, to a publick accu&s;ation: But the Court found the Party, that prevailed in the Hou&s;e of Commons, determined to ju&s;tify <HI>Rook;</HI> &s;o to comply with this, the Queen made him a Privy Coun&s;ellor, and much pains were taken on the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> to &s;tifle his re&s;entments: He was in a great mea&s;ure &s;oft|ten'd, yet he had made his complaints to &s;o many Lords, that they moved the Hou&s;e to examine, both his In&s;tructions and the Journals relating to that Expedition. A Committee of the Hou&s;e of Peers &s;ate long upon the matter: They examined all the Admirals and Land Officers, as well as <HI>Rook</HI> him&s;elf, upon the whole progre&s;s of that Af|fair. <HI>Rook</HI> was &s;o well &s;upported by the Court, and by his Party in the Hou&s;e of Commons, that he &s;eemed to de&s;pi&s;e all that the Lords could do. Some, who under&s;tood Sea matters, &s;aid, that it appear|ed from every motion that he made during the Expedition, that he intended to do nothing but amu&s;e and make a &s;hew: They al&s;o concluded, from the protection that the Mini&s;try gave him, that they intended no other. He took much pains to &s;hew, how improper a thing a De&s;cent on <HI>Cadiz</HI> was, and how fatal the Attempt mu&s;t have proved: and in doing this, he arraigned his In&s;tructions, and the De&s;ign he was &s;ent on, with great boldne&s;s, and &s;hewed little regard to the Mini&s;ters; who took more pains to bring him off, than to ju&s;ti|fy them&s;elves. The Lords of the Committee prepared a Report, which was hard upon <HI>Rook,</HI> and laid it before the Hou&s;e; but &s;o &s;trong a party was made, to oppo&s;e every thing that reflected on him, that tho' every particular in the Report was well proved, yet it was rejected, and a Vote was carried in his favour, ju&s;tifying his whole Conduct. The great Imployment given to the Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> &s;o effectually prevailed on him, that tho' the enquiry was &s;et on by his means, and upon his &s;ugge&s;tions, yet he came not to the Hou&s;e, when it was brought to a conclu&s;ion: So <HI>Rook,</HI> being but faintly pu&s;hed by him, and mo&s;t zealou&s;ly &s;upported by his party, was ju&s;|tified by a Vote, though univer&s;ally condemned by more impartial Judges. The behaviour of the Mini&s;try in this matter heightened the jealou&s;ies, with which many were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, for it was inferred,
<PB N="342" REF="362">
that they were not in earne&s;t in this whole Expedition; &s;ince the conduct, being &s;o contrary to the in&s;tructions, their ju&s;tifying the one, was plainly condemning the other.</P>
<P>The Report made by the Commi&s;&s;ioners, appointed to take the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The enquiry made into the publick Accounts.</NOTE> publick Accounts, was another bu&s;ine&s;s, that took up much time in this Se&s;&s;ion, and occa&s;ioned many Debates. They pretended, that they had made great di&s;coveries; They began with the Earl of <HI>Rane|lagh,</HI> who had been in great Po&s;ts; and had all the arts that were nece&s;&s;ary to recommend a man in a Court; who &s;tuck at nothing, that could maintain his Intere&s;t, with tho&s;e whom he &s;erved: He had been Pay-ma&s;ter of the Army in King <HI>James</HI>'s time; and being very fit for the Po&s;t, he had been continued all the la&s;t Reign: He had lived high, and &s;o it was believed, his appointments could not &s;upport &s;o great an expence: He had an Account of one and twen|ty Millions lay upon him. It was given out, that a great deal of the money, lodged in his Office, for the pay of the Army, was di|verted to other u&s;es, di&s;tributed among Favourites, or given to cor|rupt Members of Parliament; and that &s;ome Millions had been &s;ent over to <HI>Holland:</HI> It had been often &s;aid, that great di&s;coveries would be made, when&s;oever his Accounts were looked into: and that he, to &s;ave him&s;elf, would lay open the ill practices of the former Reign. But now, when all was brought under a &s;trict examination, a few incon&s;iderable Articles, of &s;ome hundreds of pounds, was all that could be found to be objected to him: and even to the&s;e, he gave clear and full An&s;wers. At la&s;t they found, that, upon the breaking of a Regiment, a Sum which he had i&s;&s;ued out for its pay, had been returned to his Office, the Regiment be|ing broke &s;ooner, than that pay was exhau&s;ted: and that no en|try of this was made in his Accounts. To this he an&s;wered, that his Officer, who received the money, was within three days after, taken &s;o ill of a confirmed Stone, that he never came again to the Office, but died in great mi&s;ery: and during tho&s;e three days, he had not enter'd that Sum in the Books. Lord <HI>Ranelagh</HI> acknow|ledged, that he was liable to account for all the money that was re|ceived by his Under Officers; but here was no crime or fraud de|&s;igned; yet this was &s;o aggravated, that he &s;aw his good Po&s;t was his greate&s;t guilt: So he quitted that, which was divided into two: One was appointed to be Pay-ma&s;ter of the Guards and Garri&s;ons at home; and another, of the Forces that were kept beyond Sea: <HI>How</HI> had the fir&s;t, as being the more la&s;ting Po&s;t. With this, all the clamour rai&s;ed again&s;t the Earl of <HI>Ranelagh</HI> was let fall; yet to make a &s;hew of &s;everity, he was expelled the Hou&s;e; But he appeared, up|on all this canva&s;&s;ing, to be much more innocent, than even his friends had believed him. <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cla|mour again&s;t the former Reign &s;till kept up.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Clamour that had been long kept up again&s;t the former Mi|ni&s;try, as Devourers of the Publick Trea&s;ure, was of &s;uch u&s;e to the
<PB N="343" REF="363">
Party, that they re&s;olved to continue it, by all po&s;&s;ible methods: So a Committee of the Hou&s;e of Commons prepared a long Addre&s;s to the Queen, reflecting on the ill management of the Funds, upon which they laid the great Debt of the Nation, and not upon the Deficien|cies: This was branched out into many particulars, which were all heavily aggravated. Yet, tho' a great part of the outcry had been formerly made again&s;t <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> Trea&s;urer of the Navy, and his Office, they found not &s;o much as a colour to fix a Complaint there: Nor could they charge any thing on the Chancery, the Trea&s;ury, or the Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice. Great Complaints were made of &s;ome Accounts, that &s;tood long out, and they in&s;i&s;ted on &s;ome pretended neglects, the old methods of the Exchequer not having been ex|actly followed: tho' it did not appear, that the Publick &s;uffered in any &s;ort by tho&s;e failures. They kept up a clamour likewi&s;e again&s;t the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Prizes, tho' they had pa&s;t their Accounts, as the Law directed; and no objection was made to them. The Ad|dre&s;s was full of &s;evere reflections and &s;piteful in&s;inuations; and thus it was carried to the Queen, and publi&s;hed to the Nation, as the &s;ence of the Commons of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Lords, to prevent the ill impre&s;&s;ions this might make, ap|pointed <NOTE PLACE="marg">It was exa|mined by the Lords, and found to be ill|grounded.</NOTE> a Committee, to examine all the ob&s;ervations, that the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners of Accounts had offered to both Hou&s;es: They &s;earched all the Publick Offices, and were amazed to find, that there was not one Article, in all the long Addre&s;s that the Commons had made to the Queen, or in the Ob&s;ervations then before them, that was of any importance, but what was fal&s;e in fact. They found the Deficiencies in the former Reign were of two &s;orts: the one was of Sums, that the Commons had voted, but for which, they had made no &s;ort of provi&s;ion: The other was, where the Supply that was given came &s;hort of the Sum it was e&s;timated at: and between the&s;e two, the Deficiencies amounted to fourteen Millions: This was the root of the great Debt that lay on the Nation. They examined into all the pre|tended mi&s;management, and found that what the Commons had &s;ta|ted &s;o invidiou&s;ly was mi&s;taken. So far had the late King and his Mini&s;ters been, from mi&s;applying the money that was given for Pub|lick Occa&s;ions, that he applied three Millions to the Publick Service, that by Law was his own Money, of which they made up the ac|count. They al&s;o found, that &s;ome &s;mall omi&s;&s;ions, in &s;ome of the forms of the Exchequer, were of no con&s;equence, and neither had nor could have any ill effect: and whereas a great clamour was rai&s;|ed again&s;t pa&s;&s;ing of Accounts by Privy Seals, they put an end to that effectually, when it appeared on what ground this was done. By the ancient methods of the Exchequer, every Account was to be car|ried on, &s;o that the new Officer was to begin his Account with the balance of the former Account; Sir <HI>Edward Seimour,</HI> who had been Trea&s;urer of the Navy, owed by his la&s;t account, an hundred and
<PB N="344" REF="364">
eighty thou&s;and pounds, and he had received after that an hundred and forty thou&s;and pounds, for which the Accounts were never made up: Now it was not po&s;&s;ible for tho&s;e who came after him, to be liable for his Accounts: Therefore the Trea&s;urers of the Navy in the la&s;t Reign, were forced to take out Privy Seals for making up their Accounts: The&s;e imported no more, than that they were to account only for the money that they them&s;elves had received: for in all other re&s;pects, their Accounts were to pa&s;s, according to the ordinary methods of the Exchequer. Complaints had been al&s;o made of the remi&s;sne&s;s of the Lords of the Trea&s;ury, or their Officers, appointed to account with the Receivers of Counties, for the Aids that had been given: but when this was examined, it appeared, that this had been done with &s;uch exactne&s;s, that of the &s;um of twenty four Millions, for which they had accounted, there was not owing above &s;ixty thou|&s;and pounds, and that was for the mo&s;t part in <HI>Wales;</HI> where it was not thought advi&s;able to u&s;e too much rigour in rai&s;ing it: and of that &s;um, there was not above fourteen thou&s;and pounds, that was to be reckoned as lo&s;t. The Collectors of the Cu&s;toms likewi&s;e an&s;wered all the ob&s;ervations made on their accounts &s;o fully, that the Hou&s;e of Commons was &s;atisfied with their An&s;wers, and di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed them, without &s;o much as a reprimand. All this was re|ported to the Hou&s;e of Lords, and they laid it before the Queen in an Addre&s;s, which was afterwards printed with the Vouchers to every particular: By this means, it was made out to the &s;atisfaction of the whole Nation, how fal&s;e tho&s;e Reports were, which had been &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread, and were &s;o ea&s;ily believed by the greater part: for the bulk of Mankind will be always apt to think, that Courts and Mini&s;ters &s;erve their own ends, and &s;tudy to enrich them&s;elves at the publick co&s;t. This Examination held long, and was followed with great exactne&s;s, and had all the effect that could be de&s;ired from it: for it &s;ilenced that noi&s;e, which the late King's enemies had rai&s;ed, to a&s;per&s;e him and his Mini&s;ters. With this the Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament ended. In it the Lords had rendered them|&s;elves very con&s;iderable, and had gained an univer&s;al Reputation over the whole Nation: It is true, tho&s;e who had oppo&s;ed the per&s;ons, that had carried matters before them in this Se&s;&s;ion, were &s;o near them in number, that things of the greate&s;t con&s;equence were carried only by one or two voices; therefore as they intended to have a clear Majority in both Hou&s;es, in the next Se&s;&s;ion, they prevailed with the Queen, &s;oon after the Prorogation, to create four new Peers, who had been the violente&s;t of the whole Party; <HI>Finch, Gower, Granvil,</HI> and young <HI>Seimour,</HI> were made Barons. Great reflections <NOTE PLACE="marg">Some new Peers made.</NOTE> were made upon this Promotion; When &s;ome &s;evere things had been thrown out in the Hou&s;e of Commons upon the oppo&s;ition, that they met with from the Lords, it was in&s;inuated, that it would be ea&s;y to find men of Merit and E&s;tate to make a clear Majority in
<PB N="345" REF="365">
that Hou&s;e: This was an open declaration of a de&s;ign, to put eve|ry thing in the hands and power of that Party. It was al&s;o an en|croachment on one of the tendere&s;t points of the Prerogative, to make motions of creating Peers in the Hou&s;e of Commons. <HI>Hervey,</HI> tho' of the other &s;ide, was at the &s;ame time made a Baron, by pri|vate favour. Thus the Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament was brought to a much better conclu&s;ion, than could have been rea&s;onably expected by tho&s;e, who knew of whom it was con&s;tituted, and how it had begun. No harm was done in it: The Succe&s;&s;ion was fortified by a new &s;ecu|rity, and the popular clamours of Corruption and Peculate, with which the Nation had been &s;o much po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, were in a great mea|&s;ure di&s;&s;ipated.</P>
<P>The Proceedings of the Convocation, which &s;ate at the &s;ame time, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pro|ceedings in Convoca|tion.</NOTE> are next to be related: At the fir&s;t opening of it, there was a Con|te&s;t between the Two Hou&s;es, that la&s;ted &s;ome days, concerning an Addre&s;s to the Queen. The Lower Hou&s;e intended to ca&s;t &s;ome reflections on the former Reign, in imitation of what the Hou&s;e of Commons had done, and the&s;e were worded &s;o invidiou&s;ly, that mo&s;t of the Bi&s;hops were pointed at by them; but the Upper Hou&s;e, refu&s;ing to concur, the Lower Hou&s;e receded, and &s;o they both a|greed in a very decent Addre&s;s. The Queen received it graciou&s;ly, promi&s;ing all favour and protection to the Church, and exhorting them all to Peace and Union among them&s;elves. After this, the Lower Hou&s;e made an Addre&s;s to the Bi&s;hops, that they might find an expedient, for putting an end to tho&s;e Di&s;putes, that had &s;topt the Proceedings of former Convocations: The Bi&s;hops re&s;olved to offer them all that they could, without giving up their Character and Authority: So they made a Propo&s;ition, that, in the intervals of Se&s;|&s;ions, the Lower Hou&s;e might appoint Committees to prepare Mat|ters, and when bu&s;ine&s;s was brought regularly before them, that the Archbi&s;hop &s;hould &s;o order the Prorogations, that they might have convenient and &s;ufficient time, to &s;it and deliberate about it. This fully &s;atisfied many of that Body; But the Majority thought, this kept the matter &s;till in the Archbi&s;hop's Power, as it was indeed in|tended it &s;hould: So they made another application to the Bi&s;hops, de&s;iring them to refer the points in que&s;tion to the Queen's deci&s;ion, and to &s;uch as &s;he &s;hould appoint to hear and &s;ettle them. To this the Bi&s;hops an&s;wered, that they reckoned them&s;elves &s;afe and happy in the Queen's Protection, and would pay all due &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to her Plea&s;ure and Orders: But the Rights, which the Con&s;titution of the Church and the Law had ve&s;ted in them, were Tru&s;ts lodged with them, which they were to convey to their Succe&s;&s;ors, as they had received them from their Predece&s;&s;ors, and that it was not in their power to refer them. It would have been a &s;trange &s;ight, very ac|ceptable to the enemies of the Church, chiefly to Papi&s;ts, to &s;ee the Two Hou&s;es of Convocation, pleading their Authority and Rights
<PB N="346" REF="366">
before a Committee of Council, that was to determine the matter. This failing, the Lower Hou&s;e tried what they could obtain of the Hou&s;e of Commons; but they could not be carried further than a general Vote, which amounted to nothing, that they would &s;tand by them in all their ju&s;t Rights and Privileges. They next made a &s;eparate Addre&s;s to the Queen, de&s;iring her Protection, praying her to hear and determine the Di&s;pute: She received this favour|ably; &s;he &s;aid, &s;he would con&s;ider of it, and &s;end them Her an|&s;wer. The matter was now brought into the hands of the Mini&s;ters; The Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI> was of their &s;ide, but confe&s;&s;ed that he under&s;tood not the Controver&s;y; The Judges and the Queen's Council were ordered to examine, how the matter &s;tood in point of Law, which was thus &s;tated to them: The con&s;tant practice, as far as we had Books or Records, was, that the Archbi&s;hop prorogued the Convocation by a <HI>Schedule;</HI> of this the Form was &s;o fixed, that it could not be altered but by Act of Parliament: There was a Clau&s;e in the Schedule, that continued all matters before the Convo|cation, in the &s;tate in which they then were, to the day, to which He prorogued them; this made it evident, that there could be no intermediate Se&s;&s;ion, for a Se&s;&s;ion of the Lower Hou&s;e could, by pa&s;&s;ing a Vote in any matter, alter the &s;tate in which it was. It was kept a &s;ecret, what opinion the Lawyers came to, in this matter. It was not doubted, but they were again&s;t the preten&s;ions of the Lower Hou&s;e; The Queen made no An&s;wer to their Addre&s;s; and it was believed, that the rea&s;on of this was, becau&s;e the An&s;wer mu&s;t, according to the opinion of Lawyers, have been contrary to what they expected: and therefore the Mini&s;ters cho&s;e rather, to give no An&s;wer, and that it &s;hould &s;eem to be forgot, than that &s;uch an one &s;hould be given, as would put an end to the Debate, which they intended to cheri&s;h and &s;upport.</P>
<P>The Lower Hou&s;e finding, that by oppo&s;ing their Bi&s;hops in &s;o rough as well as in &s;o unheard of a manner, they were repre&s;ented as favourers of Presbytery; to clear them&s;elves of that imputation, came &s;uddenly into a conclu&s;ion, that Epi&s;copacy was of Divine and Apo&s;tolical Right. The Party that &s;tuck together in their Votes, and kept their intermediate Se&s;&s;ions &s;igned this, and brought it up to the Bi&s;hops, de&s;iring them to concur in &s;ettling the matter; &s;o that it might be the &s;tanding Rule of the Church. This was a plain attempt to make a Canon or Con&s;titution, without obtaining a Royal Licence, which by the Statute confirming the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the Clergy in King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth's time, made both them, and all who cho&s;e them, incur a <HI>Premunire;</HI> So the Bi&s;hops re&s;olved not to entertain the Propo&s;ition, and a great many of the Lower Hou&s;e ap|prehending, what the con&s;equence of &s;uch proceedings might be, by a Petition to the Bi&s;hops, pray'd that it might be enter'd in their Books, that they had not concurred in that Definition, nor in the
<PB N="347" REF="367">
Addre&s;s made pur&s;uant to it. The Lower Hou&s;e looked on what they did in this matter, as a Ma&s;ter-piece: for if the Bi&s;hops con|curred with them, they reckoned they gained their point: and if they refu&s;ed it, they re&s;olved to make them, who would not come up to &s;uch a po&s;itive Definition, pa&s;s for &s;ecret favourers of Presby|tery. But the Bi&s;hops &s;aw into their de&s;igns, and &s;ent them for An|&s;wer, That they acquie&s;ced in the Declaration, that was already made on that head, in the Preface to the Book of Ordinations; and that they did not think it &s;afe, either for them or for the Clergy, to go further in that matter, without a Royal Licence. To this, a dark An&s;wer was made, and &s;o all the&s;e matters were at a full &s;tand, when the Se&s;&s;ion came to an end, by the Prorogation of the Parlia|ment; which was become nece&s;&s;ary, the Two Hou&s;es being fixed in an oppo&s;ition to one another.</P>
<P>From tho&s;e Di&s;putes in Convocation, Divi&s;ions ran thro' the whole <NOTE PLACE="marg">Great di&s;|tractions a|mong the Clergy</NOTE> Body of the Clergy, and to fix the&s;e, new names were found out: they were di&s;tingui&s;hed by the names of HIGH CHURCH and LOW CHURCH. All that treated the Di&s;&s;enters with temper and moderation, and were for re&s;iding con&s;tantly at their Cures, and for labouring diligently in them; that expre&s;&s;ed a zeal again&s;t the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and for the Revolution; that wi&s;hed well to the pre&s;ent War, and to the Alliance again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> were repre&s;ented as &s;ecret favourers of Presbytery, and as ill affected to the Church, and were called <HI>Low Churchmen:</HI> it was &s;aid, that they were in the Church only, while the Law and Preferments were on its &s;ide; but that they were ready to give it up, a&s;&s;oon as they &s;aw a proper time for declaring them&s;elves: With the&s;e fal&s;e and invidious Characters did the High Party endeavour to load all tho&s;e, who could not be brought into their mea&s;ures and de&s;igns. When the Se&s;&s;ion was at an end, the Court was wholly taken up with the preparations for the Campaign.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> had a great dome&s;tick affliction at <NOTE PLACE="marg">1703 Preparations for the Cam|paign.</NOTE> this time: He lo&s;t his only Son, a graceful per&s;on, and a very pro|mi&s;ing youth: He died at <HI>Cambridge</HI> of the Small Pox: This, as may be imagined, went very deep in his Father's heart, and &s;top his pa&s;&s;ing the Seas &s;ome days longer than he had intended. Upon his arrival on the other &s;ide, the <HI>Dutch</HI> brought their Armies into the Field: The fir&s;t thing they undertook, was the Siege of <HI>Bonne.</HI> In the mean while, all mens eyes were turned towards <HI>Bavaria:</HI> The Court of <HI>Vienna</HI> had given it out, all the former Winter, that they would bring &s;uch a Force upon that Elector, as would quick|ly put an end to that War, and &s;eize his whole Country. But the &s;lowne&s;s of that Court appeared on this, as it had done on many other occa&s;ions: For tho they brought two Armies into the Field, yet they were not able to deal with the Elector's Forces;
<PB N="348" REF="368">
<HI>Villars,</HI> who lay with his Army at <HI>Strazbourg,</HI> had Orders to break thro' and join the Elector: So he was to force his way to him, at all adventures. He pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and &s;et down before <HI>Fort Keil,</HI> which lay over again&s;t <HI>Strasbourg,</HI> and took it in a few days. Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> was in no condition to rai&s;e the Siege; for the be&s;t part of his Army was called away to the War in <HI>Bavaria:</HI> He therefore po&s;ted him&s;elf advantageou&s;ly at <HI>Stollhoffen,</HI> yet he could not have maintained it, if the <HI>States</HI> had not &s;ent him a good Body of Foot, which came &s;ea&s;onably, a few days before Mare&s;|chal <HI>Villars</HI> attack'd him with an Army, that was more than double his number: But his Men, chiefly the <HI>Dutch</HI> Battalions, received them with &s;o much courage, that the <HI>French</HI> were forc|ed to quit the attack, after they had lo&s;t about four thou&s;and Men in it. Yet, upon repeated Orders from <HI>France,</HI> Mare&s;chal <HI>Villars</HI> re&s;olved to venture the lo&s;s of his whole Army, rather than abandon the Elector; who, tho' he had taken <HI>Newburg,</HI> and had &s;urprized <HI>Ratisbon,</HI> and had &s;everal advantages in little engage|ments with the Imperiali&s;ts, yet was like to be over-powered by a &s;uperior Force, if he was not relieved in time. The Black Fo|re&s;t was thought impracticable in that &s;ea&s;on, which was a very wet one; This was to much tru&s;ted to, &s;o that the Pa&s;&s;es were ill looked after: and therefore <HI>Villars</HI> overcame all difficulties, and joined the Elector: but his Troops were &s;o harra&s;&s;ed with the March, that he was obliged to put them, for &s;ome time, into Quar|ters of Refre&s;hment.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> carried on the Siege of <HI>Bonne,</HI> with <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bonne</HI> $ken.</NOTE> &s;uch vigour, that they capitulated within ten days after the Trenches were opened; The <HI>French</HI> reckoned upon a longer re&s;i&s;tance, and hoped to have diverted this by an attempt upon <HI>Liege:</HI> The <HI>States</HI> had a &s;mall Army about <HI>Ma&s;tricht,</HI> which the <HI>French</HI> intended to fall upon, being much &s;uperior to it: But they found the <HI>Dutch</HI> in &s;o good order, and &s;o well po&s;ted, that they retired within their Lines, a&s;&s;oon as they &s;aw the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> after the Siege of <HI>Bonne,</HI> was marching towards them. The Winter had produced very little action in <HI>Italy:</HI> The Country was under another heavy Plague, by a continued &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of threatning, and of &s;ome very devouring Earthquakes: <HI>Rome</HI> it&s;elf had a &s;hare in the common Ca|lamity: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Earth quakes in <HI>Italy.</HI></NOTE> but it proved to them more dreadful, than it was mi&s;chie|vous. Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> found that his Letters, and the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing repre&s;entations he could &s;end to the Court of <HI>Vienna,</HI> had no ef|fect: &s;o at la&s;t he obtained leave to go thither.</P>
<P>The Motions of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Army made it believed, there was a de|&s;ign <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Battle of <HI>$ckereu.</HI></NOTE> on <HI>Antwerp: Cohorn</HI> was making Advances in the <HI>Dutch Flan|ders,</HI> and <HI>Opdam</HI> commanded a &s;mall Army on the other &s;ide of the <HI>Scheld,</HI> while the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> lay with the main Army, near the Lines in <HI>Brabant. Bouflers</HI> was detached from <HI>Villeroy</HI>'s
<PB N="349" REF="369">
Army, with a Body, double in number to <HI>Opdam</HI>'s, to fall on him; he marched &s;o quick, that the <HI>Dutch,</HI> being &s;urprized at <HI>Eckeren,</HI> were put in great di&s;order, and <HI>Opdam,</HI> apprehending all was lo&s;t, fled with a Body of his Men to <HI>Breda:</HI> but the <HI>Dutch</HI> rallied, and maintained their ground with &s;uch firmne&s;s, that the <HI>French</HI> retired, little to their honour; &s;ince tho' they were much &s;uperior in num|ber, yet they let the <HI>Dutch</HI> recover out of their fir&s;t confu&s;ion, and keep their ground, although for&s;aken by their General, who ju&s;tified him&s;elf in the be&s;t manner he could, and ca&s;t the blame on others.</P>
<P><HI>Bouflers</HI>'s Conduct was &s;o much cen&s;ured, that it was thought this fini&s;hed his di&s;grace; for he was no more put at the head of the <HI>French</HI> Armies: Nor was the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> without &s;ome &s;hare of cen&s;ure on this occa&s;ion, &s;ince it was pretended, that he ought to have &s;ent a force to &s;upport <HI>Opdam,</HI> or have made an at|tempt on <HI>Villeroy</HI>'s Army, when it was weakened by the detachment &s;ent with <HI>Bouflers.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> Lines were judged to be &s;o &s;trong, that the forcing <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Huy, Lim|bourg,</HI> and <HI>Guelder,</HI> with all the <HI>Coudras</HI> taken.</NOTE> them &s;eemed impracticable, &s;o the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> turned to|wards <HI>Huy,</HI> which was &s;oon taken; and after that to <HI>Limbourg,</HI> which he took with no lo&s;s, but that of &s;o much time, as was nece&s;&s;ary to bring up a train of Artillery: and as &s;oon as that was done, the Gar|ri&s;on were made Pri&s;oners of War, for they were in no condition to maintain a Siege. <HI>Guelder</HI> was al&s;o blockt up, &s;o that before the end of the Campaign, it was brought to capitulate. Thus the <HI>Low Rhine</HI> was &s;ecured, and all that Country, called the <HI>Coudras,</HI> was in|tirely reduced: This was all that our Troops, in conjunction with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> could do in <HI>Flanders:</HI> We had the &s;uperior Army, but what by rea&s;on of the cautious maxims of the <HI>States,</HI> what by rea&s;on of the Factions among them, which were ri&s;ing very high, between tho&s;e, who had been of the late King's Party, and were now for hav|ing a Captain General, and tho&s;e of the <HI>Love&s;tein</HI> Party, who were for governing all by a deputation from the <HI>States,</HI> no great de&s;ign could be undertaken by an Army &s;o much di&s;tracted.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Upper Rhine,</HI> matters went much wor&s;e; <HI>Villars</HI> lay, for <NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;ucce&s;s of the <HI>French</HI> on the <HI>Da|nube.</HI></NOTE> &s;ome time on the <HI>Danube,</HI> while the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> marched into <HI>Tirol,</HI> and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of <HI>In&s;pruck:</HI> The Emperor's Force was &s;o broken into many &s;mall Armies, in different places, that he had not one good one any where: he had none at all in <HI>Tirol:</HI> and all that the Prince of <HI>Baden</HI> could do, was to watch <HI>Villars</HI>'s motions: but he did not venture on attacking him, during this &s;e|paration. Many blamed his conduct: &s;ome called his courage, and others his fidelity in que&s;tion; while many excu&s;ed him, &s;ince his Army was both weak, and ill furni&s;hed in all re&s;pects. The Duke of <HI>Vendome</HI> had Orders to march from the <HI>Milaneze</HI> to <HI>Tirol,</HI> there to join the Elector of <HI>Bavaria:</HI> upon which junction, the ruin of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> would have probably followed: But the Boors

in <HI>Tirol</HI> ro&s;e, and attack'd the Elector with &s;o much re&s;olution, that he was forced to retire out of the Country, with con&s;iderable lo&s;s, and was driven out before the Duke of <HI>Vendome</HI> could join him, &s;o that he came too late: He &s;eemed to have a de&s;ign on <HI>Trent,</HI> but the Boors were now &s;o animated with their &s;ucce&s;&s;es, and were &s;o con|ducted and &s;upported by Officers and Troops &s;ent them by the Em|peror, that <HI>Vendome</HI> was forced to return back, without being able to effect any thing.</P>
<P>Nothing pa&s;&s;ed this Summer in <HI>Italy:</HI> The Imperiali&s;ts were too weak, and too ill &s;upplied from <HI>Germany,</HI> to be able to act offen|&s;ively: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Little done in <HI>Italy.</HI></NOTE> and the mi&s;carriage of the de&s;ign upon <HI>Tirol,</HI> lo&s;t the <HI>French</HI> &s;o much time, that they undertook nothing, unle&s;s it were the Siege of <HI>O$tiglia,</HI> in which they failed. <HI>Ber&s;ello,</HI> after a long Blockade, was forced to capitulate, and by that means, the <HI>French</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of the Duke of <HI>Modena</HI>'s Country: The Duke of <HI>Bur|gundy</HI> came to <HI>Al&s;ace,</HI> and &s;ate down before <HI>Bri&s;ack,</HI> of which he was &s;oon Ma&s;ter, by the cowardice or treachery of tho&s;e who com|manded, for which they were condemned by a Council of War.</P>
<P>The Emperor's misfortunes grew upon him; Cardinal <HI>Calonitz</HI> and <HI>E&s;terha$i</HI> had the Government of <HI>Hungary,</HI> tru&s;ted chiefly to <NOTE PLACE="marg">A War be|gun in <HI>Hun|gary.</HI></NOTE> them: The former was &s;o cruel, and the other &s;o ravenous, that the <HI>Hungarians</HI> took advantage from this di&s;traction in the Emperor's Affairs, to run together in great bodies, and in many places, &s;etting Prince <HI>Ragotzki</HI> at their head. They demanded, that their Grie|vances &s;hould be redre&s;&s;ed, and that their Privileges &s;hould be re|&s;tored: They were much animated in this, by the practices of the <HI>French,</HI> and the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI>'s Agents: Some &s;mall a&s;&s;i&s;tance was &s;ent them by the way of <HI>Poland;</HI> They were encouraged to enter upon no Treaty, but to unite and fortify them&s;elves; a&s;&s;urances being given them, that no Peace &s;hould be concluded, unle&s;s they were fully re&s;tored to all their antient Liberties.</P>
<P>The Court of <HI>Vienna</HI> was much alarmed at this; fearing it might <NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;orders in the Empe|ror's Court.</NOTE> be &s;ecretly &s;et on by the <HI>Turks:</HI> tho' that Court gave all po&s;&s;ible a&s;|&s;urances, that they would maintain the Peace of <HI>Carlowitz</HI> mo&s;t re|ligiou&s;ly, and that they would in no &s;ort encourage or a&s;&s;i&s;t the Malecontents. A Revolution happening in that Empire, in which a new Sultan was &s;et up, rai&s;ed new apprehen&s;ions of a breach on that &s;ide: But the Sultan renewed the a&s;&s;urances of maintaining the Peace &s;o &s;olemnly, that all tho&s;e fears were &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated. There was a great Faction in the Emperor's Court, and among his Mini&s;|ters; and it did not appear, that he had &s;trength of Genius enough to govern them. Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> was much &s;u&s;pected of being in the Intere&s;ts of <HI>France;</HI> The Prince of <HI>Baden,</HI> and Prince <HI>Eugene,</HI> both agreed in charging his Conduct, tho' they differed almo&s;t in every thing el&s;e: yet he was &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Emperor's favour and con|fidence, that it was not ea&s;y to get him &s;et a&s;ide: In conclu&s;ion, he
<PB N="351" REF="371">
was advanced to a high Po&s;t in the Emperor's Hou&s;hold, and Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> was made Pre&s;ident of the Council of War.</P>
<P>But what effect &s;oever this might have in &s;ucceeding Campaigns, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Augsbourg</HI> and <HI>Lan|daw</HI> taken by the <HI>French.</HI></NOTE> it was then too late in the year to find remedies for the pre&s;ent di&s;|orders: and all Affairs on the South of the <HI>Danube</HI> were falling into great confu&s;ion. Things went a little better on the North &s;ide of that River: The Upper Palatinate was entirely conquered; but near the end of the year, <HI>Augsbourg</HI> was forced to &s;ubmit to the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and <HI>Landaw</HI> was be&s;ieged by the <HI>French: Tal|lard,</HI> who commanded the Siege, took it in fewer Weeks, than it had co&s;t the <HI>Germans</HI> Months, to take it the former year: Nor was this all, an Army of the Confederates was brought together to rai&s;e the Siege: The young Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e</HI> commanded, but the Prince of <HI>Na&s;&s;aw Welburg,</HI> as a man of more experience in War, was chiefly depended on; tho' his conduct &s;hewed how little he de&s;erved it. The Emperor's Birth-day, was a day of diver&s;ion, and the <HI>German</HI> Generals, then at <HI>Spire,</HI> allowed them&s;elves all the idle liberties, u&s;ed in Courts on &s;uch days, without the ordinary precaution, of having Scouts or Parties abroad, in the &s;ame carele&s;s &s;tate, as if no Enemy had been near them. <HI>Tallard,</HI> having intelligence of this, left a Party of his Army to make a &s;hew, and maintain the Works before <HI>Lan|daw;</HI> and marched with his be&s;t Troops again&s;t the <HI>Germans:</HI> He &s;urprized and routed them: upon which <HI>Landaw</HI> capitulated: with this the warlike operations of this Campaign ended, very gloriou&s;ly, and with great advantage to the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>But two great Negotiations, then brought to a conclu&s;ion, very <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Treaty with the King of <HI>Portugal.</HI></NOTE> much changed the face of Affairs: All the Confederates pre&s;&s;ed the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> to come into the Alliance, as his own intere&s;t led him to it; &s;ince it was vi&s;ible, that as &s;oon as <HI>Spain</HI> was once united to the Crown of <HI>France,</HI> he could not hope to continue long in <HI>Portugal.</HI> The <HI>Almirante</HI> of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> was believed to be in the Intere&s;ts of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria;</HI> therefore to &s;end him out of the way, he was appointed to go Amba&s;&s;ador to <HI>France;</HI> He &s;eemed to undertake it, and made the nece&s;&s;ary preparations; He &s;aw this Emba&s;&s;y was intended for an Exile, and that it put him in the power of his enemies; So, after he had rai&s;ed what was nece&s;&s;ary to defray his expence, he &s;ecretly changed his cour&s;e, and e&s;caped with the Wealth he had in his hands to <HI>Lisbon:</HI> where he entered into &s;ecret Negotiations with the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and the Emperor: He gave great a&s;&s;urances of the good di&s;po&s;itions, in which both the People and Grandees of <HI>Spain</HI> were, who were grown &s;ick of their new Ma&s;ters. The ri&s;que, he him&s;elf ran, &s;eemed a very full credential; He a&s;&s;ured them, the new King was de&s;pi&s;ed, and that the <HI>French</HI> about him were univer&s;ally hated; The <HI>Spaniards</HI> could not bear the being made a Province, either to <HI>France</HI> or to the Emperor.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="372">
He therefore propo&s;ed that the Emperor and the King of the <HI>Romans</HI> &s;hould renounce all their preten&s;ions, and transfer them to the Archduke, and declare him King of <HI>Spain;</HI> and that he &s;hould be immediately &s;ent thither; for he a&s;&s;ured them, the <HI>Spa|niards</HI> would not revolt from a King that was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, till they &s;aw another King, who claimed his Right: and in that ca&s;e, they would think they had a right to adhere to the King they lik|ed be&s;t: The King of <HI>Portugal</HI> likewi&s;e demanded an enlargement of his Frontiers, and &s;ome new acce&s;&s;ions to his Crown, which were rea&s;onable, but could not be &s;tipulated, but by a King of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>In the Treaty, that the Emperor had made with the late King, and with the <HI>States,</HI> one Article was, that they &s;hould be at liber|ty to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of the Dominions, which the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> had in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and he ve&s;ted in them the right, that their Arms &s;hould give them, in the&s;e Acqui&s;itions; upon which the King had de&s;igned to &s;end a great Fleet, with a Land Army, into the Bay of <HI>Mexico,</HI> to &s;eize &s;ome important places there, with a de&s;ign of re&s;toring them to the Crown of <HI>Spain,</HI> upon ad|vantageous Articles for a free Trade, as &s;oon as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;hould receive a King, of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria.</HI> This de&s;ign was now laid a&s;ide, and the rea&s;on that the Mini&s;ters gave for it, was, that the <HI>Almirante</HI> had a&s;&s;ured them, that if we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed our &s;elves of any of their places in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> the whole Nation would by that means become entirely <HI>French;</HI> they would never believe our promi&s;es of re&s;toring them; and &s;eeing they had no Naval Power of their own to recover them, they would go into the <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;t very cordially, as the only way left to recover the&s;e Places.</P>
<P>An entire credit was given to the <HI>Almirante;</HI> So the Queen and the <HI>States</HI> agreed to &s;end over a great Fleet, with a Land Army of twelve thou&s;and Men, together with a great &s;upply of Money and Arms to <HI>Portugal;</HI> that King undertaking to have an Army of twenty eight thou&s;and Men ready to join ours. In this Treaty, an incident hap|pened, that had almo&s;t &s;poiled the whole; The King of <HI>Portugal</HI> in&s;i&s;ted, on demanding the Flag, and the other Re&s;pects to be paid by our Admiral, when he was in his Ports; The Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI> in&s;i&s;ted, it was a di&s;honour to <HI>England</HI> to &s;trike, even in another King's Ports; This was not demanded of the Fleet, that was &s;ent to bring over Queen <HI>Katharine,</HI> &s;o, tho' <HI>Methuen</HI> our Amba&s;&s;ador, had agreed to this Article, he pre&s;&s;ed the Queen not to ratify it.</P>
<P><HI>Methuen,</HI> in his own ju&s;tification, &s;aid, he con&s;ented to the Ar|ticle, becau&s;e he &s;aw it was in&s;i&s;ted on &s;o much, that no Treaty could be concluded, unle&s;s that Point were yielded: The low &s;tate of their affairs, in the year 1662, when the Protection of <HI>England</HI> was all they had in view, for their pre&s;ervation, made

&s;uch a difference between that and the pre&s;ent time, that the one was not to be &s;et up for a Precedent to govern the other: be&s;ides, even then the matter was much conte&s;ted in their Councils, tho' the extremities, to which they were reduced, made them yield it. The Lord <HI>Godolphin</HI> looked on this, as too incon&s;iderable to be in|&s;i&s;ted on, the whole affairs of <HI>Europe</HI> &s;eemed to turn upon this Trea|ty, and &s;o important a matter ought not to be retarded a day for &s;uch Punctilio's, as a &s;alute or &s;triking the Flag: and it &s;eemed rea|&s;onable, that every Sovereign Prince &s;hould claim this acknowledg|ment, unle&s;s where it was otherwi&s;e &s;tipulated by expre&s;s Treaties. The laying &s;o much weight on &s;uch Matters, very much heigh|tened jealou&s;ies; and it was &s;aid, that the Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI> and the Tories &s;eemed to lay hold on every thing that could ob&s;truct the progre&s;s of the War; while the round proceeding of the Lord <HI>Godolphin</HI> reconciled many to him. The Queen confirmed the Treaty; upon which, the Court of <HI>Vienna</HI> was de&s;ired to do their part. But that Court proceeded with its ordinary &s;lowne&s;s; The milde&s;t Cen&s;ure pa&s;t on the&s;e delays was, that they proceeded from an unrea&s;onable affectation of Magnificence in the Ceremo|nial, which could not be performed &s;oon nor ea&s;ily, in a poor but a haughty Court: It was done at la&s;t, but &s;o late in the year, that the new declared King of <HI>Spain</HI> could not reach <HI>Holland,</HI> be|fore the end of <HI>October.</HI> A Squadron of our Fleet was lying there, to bring him over; &s;uch as was wont to convoy the late King, when he cro&s;&s;ed the Seas. But the Mini&s;ters of the King of <HI>Spain</HI> thought it was not &s;trong enough; They pretended, they had adverti&s;ements, that the <HI>French</HI> had a &s;tronger Squadron in <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> which might be &s;ent out to intercept him: &s;o an additional &s;trength was &s;ent; this lo&s;t &s;ome time, and a fair wind.</P>
<P>It had like to have been more fatal; for about the end of <HI>No|vember</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The great Wind in <HI>No|vember.</HI></NOTE> the Weather grew very boi&s;terous, and broke out on the 27th of <HI>November,</HI> in the mo&s;t violent Storm, both by Sea and Land, that had been known in the memory of man: The City of <HI>London</HI> was &s;o &s;haken with it, that people were generally afraid of being buried in the ruines of their hou&s;es: Some hou&s;es fell and cru&s;hed their Ma&s;ters to death: great hurt was done in the Sou|thern parts of <HI>England;</HI> little happening in the North, where the Storm was not &s;o violent. There was a great fall of Trees, chief|ly of Elms, that were blown down by the wind. We had, at that time, the be&s;t part of our Naval Force upon the Sea: which filled all people with great apprehen&s;ions of an irreparable lo&s;s; and indeed, if the Storm had not been at its height at full Flood, and in a Spring tide, the lo&s;s might have proved fatal to the Na|tion. It was &s;o con&s;iderable, that fourteen or fifteen Men of War were ca&s;t away, in which 1500 Seamen peri&s;hed; Few Merchant|men
<PB N="354" REF="374">
were lo&s;t; &s;uch as were driven to Sea were &s;afe: &s;ome few only were over-&s;et. Thus the mo&s;t threatning danger, to which the Nation could be expo&s;ed, went off with little damage: we all &s;aw our hazard, &s;ince the lo&s;s of our Fleet mu&s;t have been the lo&s;s of the Nation. If this great Hurricane had come at Low wa|ter, or in a quarter tide, our Ships mu&s;t have been driven out upon the Banks of Sand, that lie before the Coa&s;t, and have &s;tuck and peri&s;hed there, as &s;ome of the Men of War did: but the Sea being &s;o full of water, all but &s;ome heavy Ships got over the&s;e &s;afe: Our Squadron, which was then in the <HI>Mae&s;e,</HI> &s;uffered but little, and the Ships were &s;oon re&s;itted, and ready to &s;ail.</P>
<P>About the end of <HI>December</HI> the King of <HI>Spain</HI> landed at <HI>Port&s;|mouth;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The new King of <HI>Spain</HI> came to <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> The Duke of <HI>Somer&s;et</HI> was &s;ent by the Queen to receive him, and to bring him to an Interview, which was to be at <HI>Wind|&s;or;</HI> Prince <HI>George</HI> went and met him on the way, and he was treated with great Magnificence: The Court was very &s;plendid, and much thronged; The Queen's Behaviour towards him was very noble and obliging; The young King charmed all that were there; he had a gravity beyond his Age, tempered with much mode&s;ty; His behaviour was in all points &s;o exact, that there was not a circum&s;tance, in his whole deportment, that was liable to cen&s;ure; He paid an extraordinary Re&s;pect to the Queen, and yet maintained a due greatne&s;s in it; He had an art of &s;eeming well plea&s;ed with every thing, without &s;o much as &s;miling once all the while he was at Court, which was only three days; He &s;poke but little, and all he &s;aid was judicious and obliging; All po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te was made, in fitting out the Fleet, &s;o that he &s;et &s;ail in the beginning of <HI>January,</HI> and for five days he had a fair wind with good weather, but then the wind changed, and he was driven back to <HI>Port&s;mouth;</HI> He lay there above three weeks, and then he had a very pro&s;perous Navigation. The Forces, that were ordered to go over to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, were by this time got ready to attend on him, &s;o he &s;ailed with a great Fleet, both of Men of War and Tran&s;port Ships: He arrived happily at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> where he was re|ceived <NOTE PLACE="marg">He landed at <HI>Lisbon.</HI></NOTE> with all the outward expre&s;&s;ions of joy and welcome, and at an expence, in a vain magnificence, which that Court could not well bear: but a National Vanity prevailed to carry this too far, by which other things, that were more nece&s;&s;ary, were neg|lected: That Court was then very melancholy; for the young <HI>In|fanta,</HI> whom the King of <HI>Spain</HI> was to have married, as had been agreed, died a few days before his arrival.</P>
<P>While this Negotiation with <HI>Portugal</HI> was carried on, the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> began to &s;ee his own danger, if the two Crowns &s;hould come to be united; and he &s;aw, that if the King of <HI>France</HI> drove the Imperiali&s;ts out of <HI>Italy,</HI> and became Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Milaneze,</HI> he mu&s;t lie expo&s;ed, and at mercy; He had married his two

Daughters to the Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> and to King <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Spain;</HI> but as he wrote to the Emperor, he was now to take care of him&s;elf and his Son: His Alliance with <HI>France</HI> was only for one <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> came into the Alliance.</NOTE> year, which he had renewed from year to year, &s;o he offered, at the end of the year, to enter into the great Alliance; and he de|manded for his &s;hare, the <HI>Novarize</HI> and the <HI>Montferrat.</HI> His leav|ing the Allies, as he had done in the former War, &s;hewed that he maintained the character of his Family, of changing &s;ides, as oft as he could expect better terms, by a new turn: yet his intere&s;t lay &s;o vi&s;ibly now on the &s;ide of the Alliance, that it was very rea&s;ona|ble to believe, he was re&s;olved to adhere firmly to it. So when the demands he made were laid before the Court of <HI>Vienna,</HI> and from thence tran&s;mitted to <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance, that he propo&s;ed, was promi&s;ed him: The Court of <HI>Vienna</HI> had no money to &s;pare, but <HI>England</HI> and the <HI>States</HI> were to pay him twen|ty thou&s;and pounds a month, of which <HI>England</HI> was to pay him two thirds, and the <HI>States</HI> the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Since I am to relate the re&s;t of this Tran&s;action, I mu&s;t look back, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;ecret rea&s;ons of his former departure from it.</NOTE> and give &s;ome account of his departing from the Alliance in the former War, which I had from Mon&s;ieur <HI>Herval,</HI> who was then the King's Envoy in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Refugee, but originally of a <HI>German</HI> Family of <HI>Augsbourg,</HI> &s;ettled but lately in <HI>France.</HI> In <HI>Ja|nuary</HI> 1696, when the Plot for a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating the King and invad|ing the Nation, was thought &s;o &s;urely laid, that it could not mi&s;car|ry; The King of <HI>France</HI> &s;ent Mr. <HI>Chanley</HI> very &s;ecretly to the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> with a full credence to the Propo&s;itions he was to make, demanding a po&s;itive an&s;wer within &s;ix hours: with that the Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI> wrote very warmly to him; he &s;aid, he had imployed all his Intere&s;t with the King his Brother, to get the&s;e Offers made to him, which he conjur'd him to accept of, otherwi&s;e he mu&s;t look for utter ruin, without remedy or recovery. <HI>Chanley</HI> told him, that at that pre&s;ent time, he was to reckon that King <HI>James</HI> was repo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Throne of <HI>England,</HI> and that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was either dead, or in his hands: &s;o he offered to re&s;tore <HI>Cazal</HI> and <HI>Pigneroll,</HI> and all that was afterwards agreed to by the Trea|ty, if he would depart from the Alliance. The Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> being thus alarmed with a Revolution in <HI>England,</HI> and being &s;o &s;traitned in time, thought the extreme nece&s;&s;ity, to which he would be reduced, in ca&s;e that was true, mu&s;t ju&s;tify his &s;ubmitting, when otherwi&s;e his ruin was unavoidable. The wor&s;t part of this was, that he got leave to pretend to continue in the Alliance, till he had drawn all the Supplies, he was to expect for that year from <HI>England</HI> and the <HI>States,</HI> and then the whole matter was owned, as has been related in the Tran&s;actions of that year.

ravaging the Country, and they engaged the King's Troops with much re&s;olution, and &s;ometimes with great advantage; They &s;eem|ed re&s;olved to accept of nothing le&s;s, than the re&s;toring their Edicts to them; for a connivance at their own way of Wor&s;hip was offer|ed them; They had many among them, who &s;eemed qualified in a very &s;ingular manner, to be the Teachers of the re&s;t; they had a great mea&s;ure of Zeal without any Learning; they &s;carce had any Education at all; I &s;poke with the per&s;on who, by the Queen's or|der, &s;ent one among them to know the &s;tate of their Affairs; I read &s;ome of the Letters, which he brought from them, full of a &s;ublime zeal and piety, expre&s;&s;ing a courage and confidence that could not be daunted; One in&s;tance of this was, that they all agreed, that if any of them was &s;o wounded, in an Engagement with the enemy, that he could not be brought off, he &s;hould be &s;hot dead, rather than be left alive to fall into the enemies hands; It was not po&s;&s;ible then, to form a judgment of that In&s;urrection, the reports about it were &s;o various and uncertain, it being as much magnified by &s;ome, as it was undervalued by others; The whole number, that they could reckon on, was four thou&s;and men, but they had not Arms and Clothes for half that number, &s;o they u&s;ed the&s;e by turns, while the re&s;t were left at home, to follow their labour; They put the Country all about them in a great fright, and to a va&s;t expence; while no intelligence could be had of their de&s;igns, and they broke out in &s;o many diffe|rent places, that all who lay within their reach were in a perpetual agitation; It was a lamentable thing, that they lay &s;o far within the Country, that it was not po&s;&s;ible to &s;end Supplies to them, unle&s;s the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> &s;hould be in a condition to break into <HI>Dauphiny;</HI> and therefore Advices were &s;ent them, to accept of &s;uch Terms as could be had, and to re&s;erve them&s;elves for better times.</P>
<P>In <HI>Poland</HI> the &s;cene was more embroiled than ever; There was <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Affairs of <HI>Poland.</HI></NOTE> &s;ome appearance of Peace this Summer, but it went off in Winter; The old fierce Cardinal drew a Diet to <HI>War&s;aw;</HI> there it was de|clared, that their King had broken all their Laws: upon that they, by a formal Sentence, depo&s;ed him, and declared the Throne vacant. This was done, in concert with the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> who lay with his Army at &s;ome di&s;tance from them, in the neighbourhood of <HI>Dantzick,</HI> which alarmed the Citizens very much; It was believed, that they de&s;igned to choo&s;e <HI>Sobieski,</HI> the elde&s;t Son of the late King, who then lived at <HI>Bre&s;law</HI> in <HI>Sile&s;ia,</HI> and being in the Emperor's Dominions, he thought him&s;elf &s;afer than he proved to be; The King of <HI>Poland</HI> retired into <HI>Saxony</HI> in &s;ome ha&s;te, which made many con|clude, that he re&s;olved to abandon <HI>Poland;</HI> but he laid another de|&s;ign, which was executed to his mind, tho' in the &s;equel it proved not much to his advantage; <HI>Sobieski</HI> and his Brother were in a cor|re&s;pondence with the Party in <HI>Poland,</HI> that oppo&s;ed the King, upon which they ought to have looked to their own &s;ecurity with more

precaution: They, it &s;eems, apprehended nothing where they then were, and &s;o diverted them&s;elves at hunting, and otherwi&s;e in their u&s;ual manner; upon this &s;ome, &s;ent by the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> took them both Pri&s;oners, and brought them to <HI>Dre&s;den,</HI> where they were &s;afely kept; and all the Remon&s;trances that the Emperor could make, upon &s;uch an act of Ho&s;tility, had no effect. This for a while broke their mea&s;ures at <HI>War&s;aw;</HI> many for&s;ook them, while the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> &s;eemed implacable in his oppo&s;ition to <HI>Augu&s;tus;</HI> who&s;e chief confidence was in the <HI>Czar:</HI> It was &s;u&s;pected, that the <HI>French</HI> had a management in this matter; &s;ince it was certain that, by the War in <HI>Poland,</HI> a great part of that Force was diverted, which might other-wi&s;e have been engaged in the common Cau&s;e of the great Alliance. All the Advices that we had from thence agreed in this, that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> him&s;elf was in no under&s;tanding with the <HI>French,</HI> but it was vi&s;ible, that what he did, contributed not a little to &s;erve their Ends. This was the &s;tate of Affairs at Land.</P>
<P>I turn next to another Element; and to give an account of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs at See</NOTE> Operations at Sea, where things were ill de&s;igned, and wor&s;e exe|cuted; The making Prince <HI>George</HI> out Lord High Admiral, proved in many in&s;tances very unhappy to the Nation: Men of bad de|&s;igns impo&s;ed on him, he under&s;tood tho&s;e matters very little, and they &s;helter'd them&s;elves under his Name, to which a great Submi&s;|&s;ion was paid; but the Complaints ro&s;e the higher for that: Our main Fleet was ready to go out in <HI>May,</HI> but the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet was not yet come over; &s;o <HI>Rook</HI> was &s;ent out, to alarm the Coa&s;t of <HI>France;</HI> He linger'd long in Port, pretending ill health; upon that <HI>Churchill</HI> was &s;ent to command the Fleet; but <HI>Rook</HI>'s health return|ed happily for him, or he thought fit to lay a&s;ide that pretence, and went to Sea, where he continued a month; but in &s;uch a Station, as if his de&s;ign had been to keep far from meeting the <HI>French</HI> Fleet, which &s;ailed out at that time; and to do the Enemy no harm, not &s;o much as to di&s;turb their quiet, by coming near their Coa&s;t: at la&s;t he returned, without having attempted any thing.</P>
<P>It was after this re&s;olved, to &s;end a &s;trong Fleet into the <HI>Mediter|ranean;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">A $word$ $word$ into the <HI>Me|diterra|nean.</HI></NOTE> It was near the End of <HI>June,</HI> before they were ready to &s;ail, and they had Orders to come out of the <HI>Streights,</HI> by the end of <HI>September:</HI> Every thing was &s;o ill laid in this Expedition, as if it had been intended, that nothing &s;hould be done by it, be&s;ides the con|voying our Merchant Ships; which did not require the fourth part of &s;uch a Force. <HI>Shovel</HI> was &s;ent to command; when he &s;aw his In&s;tructions, he repre&s;ented to the Mini&s;try, that nothing could be ex|pected from this Voyage; He was ordered to go, and he obeyed his Orders; He got to <HI>Leghorn</HI> by the beginning of <HI>September.</HI> His arrival &s;eemed to be of great con&s;equence, and the Allies began to take courage from it; but they were &s;oon di&s;appointed of their hopes, when they under&s;tood, that by his Orders he could only &s;tay a few
<PB N="359" REF="379">
days there: Nor was it ea&s;y to imagine, what the de&s;ign of &s;o great an Expedition could be, or why &s;o much Money was thrown away on &s;uch a Project, which made us de&s;pi&s;ed by our Enemies, while it provoked our Friends; who might ju&s;tly think, they could not de|pend upon &s;uch an Ally, who managed &s;o great a Force with &s;o poor a conduct, as neither to hurt their Enemies, nor protect their Friends by it.</P>
<P>A Squadron was &s;ent to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> commanded by <HI>Gray|don;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Another to the <HI>We&s;t-In|dies.</HI></NOTE> a man brutal in his way, and not well affected to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of Affairs: The de&s;ign was, to gather all the Forces that we had, &s;cattered up and down the Plantations, and with that &s;trength to go and take <HI>Placentia,</HI> and &s;o to drive the <HI>French</HI> out of the <HI>New|foundland</HI> Trade: but the Secret of this was &s;o ill kept, that it was commonly talked of, before he failed: The <HI>French</HI> had timely no|tice of it, and &s;ent a greater Force to defend the Place, than he could bring together to attack it. His Orders were pre&s;&s;ing, in particular, that he &s;hould not go out of his way, to pur&s;ue any of the Enemy's Ships, whom he might &s;ee: The&s;e he ob&s;erved &s;o punctually, that when he &s;aw a Squadron of four <HI>French</HI> Men of War &s;ailing towards <HI>Bre&s;t,</HI> that were vi&s;ibly foul, and in no condition to make any re&s;i&s;t|ance, he &s;ent indeed one of his Ships to view them, who engaged them, but <HI>Graydon</HI> gave the Signal to call him off, upon which they got &s;afe into <HI>Bre&s;t.</HI> This was afterwards known to be <HI>Du Ca&s;&s;e</HI>'s Squadron, who was bringing Trea&s;ure home from <HI>Cartagena,</HI> and other Ports of the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> reported to be four Millions of pieces of Eight: But tho' here was a good prey lo&s;t, yet &s;o careful was the Prince's Council to excu&s;e every thing, done by &s;uch a man, that they ordered an Adverti&s;ement to be put in the <HI>Gazette,</HI> to ju&s;tify <HI>Graydon;</HI> in which it was &s;aid, that pur&s;uant to his Orders, he had not engaged that Fleet. The Orders were indeed &s;trangely given, <NOTE PLACE="marg">They return|ed without &s;ucce&s;s.</NOTE> yet our Admirals had never thought them&s;elves &s;o bound down to them, but that, upon great occa&s;ions, they might make &s;tretches; e&s;pecially where the advantage was vi&s;ible, as it was in this ca&s;e: for &s;ince they were out of the way of new Orders, and new occa&s;ions might happen, which could not be known, when their Orders were given, the nature of the Service &s;eemed to give them a greater liberty, than was fit to be allowed in the Land Service. When he came to the Plantations, he acted in &s;o &s;avage a manner, as if he had been &s;ent rather to terrify, than to protect them: When he had drawn the Forces together, that were in the Plantations, he went to attack <HI>Pla|centia:</HI> but he found it to be &s;o well defended, that he did not think fit &s;o much as to make any attempt upon it: So this Expedition ended very ingloriou&s;ly, and many Complaints of <HI>Graydon</HI>'s Con|duct was &s;ent after him.</P>
<P>There was al&s;o a great Complaint thro' the whole Fleet of their <NOTE PLACE="marg">Our Fleete were ill vic|tualled.</NOTE> Victualling; we lo&s;t many of our Seamen, who, as was &s;aid, were
<PB N="360" REF="380">
poi&s;oned by ill food; and tho' great complaints were made of the Victuallers, before the Fleet went out, yet there was not &s;uch care taken to look into it, as a matter of that con&s;equence de&s;erved: The Merchants did al&s;o complain, that they were ill &s;erved with Convoys, and &s;o little care had been taken of the <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> Fleet, that the price of Coals ro&s;e very high: It was al&s;o &s;aid, that there was not a due care had of our Seamen, that were taken by the Privateers, many of them died by rea&s;on of their ill u&s;age, while others, to deliver them&s;elves from that, went into the <HI>French</HI> Service. Thus all our Marine Affairs were much out of order, and the&s;e di&s;orders were charged on tho&s;e, who had the conduct of them; every thing was unpro&s;perous, and that will always be laid heavily on tho&s;e, who are in the management of Affairs: It is certain that, in the begin|ning of this Reign, all tho&s;e who hated the late King and his Go|vernment, or had been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the Service by him, were &s;ought out, and invited into Imployments: &s;o it was not to be expected, that they could be faithful or cordial in the War again&s;t <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The Affairs of <HI>Scotland</HI> come next to be related: A new Parlia|ment <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Affairs of <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> was called, and many were cho&s;en to &s;erve in it, who were believed to be in &s;ecret Engagements with the Court at St. <HI>Germains;</HI> The Lords, who had hitherto kept out of Parliament, and were known to be Jacobites, came and qualified them&s;elves, by taking the Oaths, to vote in Parliament: It was &s;et up for a Maxim, by the new Mini&s;try, that all the Jacobites were to be invited home: &s;o a Proclamation was i&s;&s;ued out, of a very great extent, indemnifying all per&s;ons, for all Trea&s;ons committed before <HI>April</HI> la&s;t; without any limitation of Time for their coming home, to accept of this Grace, and without demanding any Security of them for the future. The Duke of <HI>Queensbury</HI> was &s;ent down the Queen's Commi&s;&s;ioner to the Parliament: This inflamed all tho&s;e who had formerly oppo&s;|ed him; They re&s;olved to oppo&s;e him &s;till in every thing, and the greater part of the Jacobites joined with them, but &s;ome of them were bought off, as was &s;aid, by him: He, &s;eeing &s;o &s;trong an oppo|&s;ition formed again&s;t him, &s;tudied to engage the Presbyterian Party to &s;tick to him: and even the Party that united again&s;t him, were &s;o apprehen&s;ive of the &s;trength of that Intere&s;t, that they likewi&s;e &s;tu|died to court them, and were very careful not to give them any um|brage. By this, all the hopes of the Epi&s;copal Party were lo&s;t; and every thing relating to the Church did not only continue in the &s;ame &s;tate, in which it was during the former Reign, but the Presbyterians got a new Law in their favour, which gave them as firm a Set|tlement, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Presbytery was con|firmed.</NOTE> and as full a Security, as Law could give; for an Act pa&s;&s;ed, not only confirming the Claim of Rights, upon which the Crown had been offered to the late King, one of its Ar|ticles being again&s;t Prelacy, and for a Parity in the Church,
<PB N="357" REF="381">
but it was declared High Trea&s;on to endeavour any Alteration of it. It had been often propo&s;ed to the late King, to pa&s;s this into an Act, but he would never con&s;ent to it: He &s;aid, he had taken the Crown on the Terms in that Claim, and that therefore he would never make a breach on any part of it; but he would not bind his Succe&s;&s;ors, by making it a perpetual Law. Thus a Mini&s;try, that carried all Matters relating to the Church to &s;o great a heighth, yet, with other views, gave a fatal Stroke to the Epi&s;copal Intere&s;t in <HI>Scotland,</HI> to which the late King would never give way. The great <NOTE PLACE="marg">Debates concerning the Succe&s;|&s;ion to the Crown.</NOTE> Debates in this Se&s;&s;ion were concerning the Succe&s;&s;ion of the Crown, in ca&s;e the Queen &s;hould die without I&s;&s;ue. They re&s;olved to give the Preference to that Debate, before they would con&s;ider the Sup|plies; it was &s;oon re&s;olved that the Succe&s;&s;or to the Crown after the Queen, &s;hould not be the &s;ame Per&s;on that was King or Queen of <HI>England,</HI> unle&s;s the ju&s;t Rights of the Nation &s;hould be declared in Parliament, and fully &s;ettled in an Independance upon <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Intere&s;ts and Councils. After this, they went to name Particulars, which by &s;ome were carried &s;o far, that tho&s;e Expedients were in|deed the &s;etting up a Commonwealth, with the empty Name of a King: for it was propo&s;ed, that the whole Admini&s;tration &s;hould be committed to a Council, named by Parliament, and that the Legi&s;|lature &s;hould be entirely in the Parliament, by which no &s;hadow of Power was left with the Crown, and it was merely a Nominal Thing: But the further entring upon Expedients was laid a&s;ide for that Time, only one Act pa&s;s'd, that went a great way towards them: It was declared, that no &s;ucceeding King &s;hould have the Power to engage the Nation in a War, without con&s;ent of Parliament. Ano|ther Act of a &s;trange Nature pa&s;t, allowing the Importation of <HI>French</HI> Goods, which, as was pretended, were to be imported, in the Ships of a neutral State. The truth was, the Revenue was &s;o exhau&s;ted, that they had not enough to &s;upport the Government, without &s;uch help: Tho&s;e who de&s;ired to drink good Wine, and all who were concerned in Trade, ran into it; &s;o it was carried, though with great Oppo&s;ition: The <HI>Jacobites</HI> al&s;o went into it, &s;ince it opened a free Corre&s;pondence with <HI>France:</HI> It was certainly again&s;t the publick Intere&s;t of the Government, in oppo&s;ition to which private Intere&s;t does often prevail. The Court of <HI>St. Germains,</HI> perceiving &s;uch a Disjointing in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and &s;o great an Oppo&s;i|tion made in Parliament, was from thence encouraged to &s;et all their Emi&s;&s;aries in that Kingdom at work, to engage both the chief of the Nobility, and the &s;everal Tribes in the Highlands, to be ready to appear for them. One <HI>Frazier</HI> had gone thro' the High|lands the former Year, and from thence he went to <HI>France,</HI> where he pretended, he had Authority from the Highlanders, to under|take to bring together a Body of 12000 Men, if they might be a&s;|&s;i&s;ted

by &s;ome Force, together with Officers, Arms, Ammunition, and Money from <HI>France.</HI> After he had delivered this Me&s;&s;age, to the Queen at <HI>St. Germains,</HI> &s;he recommended him to the <HI>French</HI> Mini&s;ters; &s;o he had &s;ome Audiences of them. He propo&s;ed that <NOTE PLACE="marg">Practices from <HI>France.</HI></NOTE> 5000 Men &s;hould be &s;ent from <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> to land near <HI>Dundee,</HI> with Arms for 20000 Men; and that 500 &s;hould be &s;ent from <HI>Bre&s;t,</HI> to &s;eize on <HI>Fort William,</HI> which commanded the great Pa&s;s in the Highlands. The <HI>French</HI> hearkened to all this, but would not venture much upon &s;light Grounds, &s;o they &s;ent him back with &s;ome others, in whom they confided more, to &s;ee how much they might depend on, and what the Strength of the Highlanders was: They were al&s;o ordered, to try whether any of the great Nobility of that Kingdom would engage in the De&s;ign.</P>
<P>When the&s;e came over, <HI>Frazier</HI> got him&s;elf &s;ecretly introduced to the Duke of <HI>Queensbury,</HI> to whom he di&s;covered all that had <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Di&s;covery made of the&s;e.</NOTE> been already tran&s;acted: And he undertook to di&s;cover the whole Corre&s;pondence, between <HI>St. Germains</HI> and the <HI>Jacobites:</HI> He al&s;o named many of the Lords, who oppo&s;ed him mo&s;t in Parliament, and &s;aid, they were already deeply engaged. The Duke of <HI>Queens|bury</HI> hearkened very willingly to all this, and he gave him a Pa&s;s to go thro' the Highlands again, where he found &s;ome were &s;till very forward, but others were more re&s;erved. At his return, he re&s;olved to go back to <HI>France,</HI> and promi&s;ed to make a more entire Di&s;co|very: He put one Letter in the Duke of <HI>Queensbury</HI>'s hands, from the Queen at <HI>St. Germains,</HI> directed on the Back (but by another hand) to the Marquis of <HI>Athol:</HI> The Letter was writ, in &s;uch gene|ral Terms, that it might have been directed to any of the great No|bility: And probably he, who was tru&s;ted with it, had power given him to direct it to any, to whom he found it would be mo&s;t accep|table: For there was nothing in the Letter, that was particular to any one Per&s;on or Family; it only mentioned the Promi&s;es and A&s;|&s;urances &s;ent to her by that Lord. This <HI>Frazier</HI> had been ac|cu&s;ed of a Rape, committed on a Si&s;ter of the Lord <HI>Athol</HI>'s, for which he was convicted and outlawed: So it might be &s;uppo&s;ed, that he, to be revenged of the Lord <HI>Athol,</HI> who had pro&s;ecuted him for that Crime, might put his Name on the back of that Let|ter. It is certain, that the others who were more tru&s;ted, and were &s;ent over with him, avoided his Company, &s;o that he was not made acquainted with that Proceeding. <HI>Frazier</HI> came up to <HI>Lon|don</HI> in Winter, and had &s;ome Meetings with the practi&s;ing <HI>Jaco|bites</HI> about the Town, to whom he di&s;covered his Negotiation: He continued &s;till to per&s;uade the Duke of <HI>Queensbury</HI> of his Fide|lity to him: His Name was not told the Queen, for when the Duke of <HI>Queensbury</HI> wrote to her an Account of the Di&s;covery, he added, that unle&s;s &s;he commanded it, he had promi&s;ed not to name
<PB N="359" REF="385">
the Per&s;on, for he was to go back to <HI>St. Germains,</HI> to compleat the Di&s;covery. The Queen did not ask his Name, but had more re|gard to what he &s;aid, becau&s;e in the main it agreed with the Intel|ligence, that her Mini&s;ters had from their Spies at <HI>Paris.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Queensbury</HI> procured a Pa&s;s for him to go to <HI>Holland,</HI> but by another name: For he opened no part of this Matter to the Earl of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> who gave the Pa&s;s. The <HI>Jacobites</HI> in <HI>London</HI> &s;u&s;|pected <HI>Frazier</HI>'s Corre&s;pondence with the Duke of <HI>Queensbury,</HI> and gave adverti&s;ement to the Lord <HI>Athol,</HI> and by this means the whole Matter broke out, as &s;hall be told afterwards. What Influence &s;o|ever this, or any other Practice might have in <HI>Scotland,</HI> it is cer|tain the Oppo&s;ition in Parliament grew &s;till greater; and &s;ince the Duke of <HI>Queensbury</HI> would not &s;uffer them to proceed, in tho&s;e &s;trange Limitations upon the Crown, that had been propo&s;ed, tho the Queen ordered him to pa&s;s the other Bills, they would give no Supply; &s;o that the Pay of the Army, with the Charge of the Go|vernment, was to run upon Credit, and by this means Matters there were like to come to extremities. A national Humour of rendring them&s;elves a free and independent Kingdom did &s;o inflame them, that as they had a Majority of &s;eventy in Parliament; they &s;eemed ca|pable of the mo&s;t extravagant things, that could be &s;ugge&s;ted to them: The greate&s;t part of the Mini&s;try for&s;ook the Duke of <HI>Queens|bury</HI> in Parliament; both the Earl of <HI>Seafield,</HI> Lord Chancellor, the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Athol,</HI> the Lord Privy-Seal, and Lord <HI>Tarbet,</HI> the Secretary of State, with all that depended on them, broke off from him: Yet upon the Conclu&s;ion of the Se&s;&s;ion, <HI>Athol</HI> was made a Duke, and <HI>Tarbet</HI> was made Earl of <HI>Cromarty,</HI> which looked like rewarding them for their Oppo&s;ition. Soon after that, the Queen re&s;olved to revive the Order of the Thi&s;tle, that had been rai&s;ed by her Father, but was let fall by the late King: It was to be carried in a green Ribbon, as the <HI>George</HI> is in a blue, and the Glory was in the Form of a St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s Cro&s;s, with a Thi&s;tle in the middle. <HI>Argyle, Athol, Annandale, Orkney,</HI> and <HI>Seafield</HI> were the fir&s;t that had it, the number being limited to Twelve. And to &s;uch a heighth did the Di&s;orders in that Kingdom ri&s;e, that great Skill and much &s;ecret Practice &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary to &s;et Matters right there: The Aver&s;ion and Jealou&s;y towards tho&s;e, who had been mo&s;t active <NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections on the Con|duct of Af|fairs there.</NOTE> in the la&s;t Reign, and the Favour &s;hewed to tho&s;e, who were in King <HI>James</HI>'s Intere&s;ts, had an appearance of bringing Matters out of an Exce&s;s, to a Temper: And it was much magnified by tho&s;e, who in|tended to flatter the Queen, on de&s;ign to ruin her. Tho' the &s;ame Mea&s;ures were taken in <HI>England,</HI> yet there was le&s;s danger in following them here than there: Errors might be &s;ooner ob&s;erved, and ea&s;ier corrected, where Per&s;ons are in view, and are watched in all their
<PB N="360" REF="386">
Motions: but this might prove fatal at a greater di&s;tance, where it was more ea&s;y to deny or palliate Things, with great A&s;&s;urance. The Duke of <HI>Queensbury</HI>'s engro&s;&s;ing all things to him&s;elf, en|crea&s;ed the Di&s;gu&s;t, at the Credit he was in: He had begun a Prac|tice of drawing out the Se&s;&s;ions of Parliament, to an unu&s;ual length; by which his Appointments exhau&s;ted &s;o much of the Revenue, that the re&s;t of the Mini&s;ters were not paid, and that will always create di&s;content: He tru&s;ted entirely to a few Per&s;ons, and his Conduct was liable to ju&s;t Exceptions: Some of tho&s;e, who had the greate&s;t Credit with him, were believed to be engaged in a Fo|reign Intere&s;t, and his pa&s;&s;ing, or rather promoting the Act, that o|pened a Corre&s;pondence with <HI>France,</HI> was con&s;idered as a De&s;ign, to &s;ettle a Commerce there: And upon that, his Fidelity or his Ca|pacity were much que&s;tioned.</P>
<P>There were &s;till high Di&s;contents in <HI>Ireland,</HI> occa&s;ioned by the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Affairs of <HI>Ireland.</HI></NOTE> behaviour of the Tru&s;tees there. The Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> was the better received, when he went to that Government, becau&s;e he came after the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter;</HI> till it appeared, that he was in all things governed by him; and that he pur&s;ued the Mea&s;ures, which he had begun to take, of rai&s;ing new Divi&s;ions in that Kingdom: For, before that Time, the only Divi&s;ion in <HI>Ireland</HI> was, that of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> Prote&s;tants and Papi&s;ts: But of late an Animo&s;ity came to be rai&s;ed there, like that we labour un|der in <HI>England,</HI> between Whig and Tory. The wi&s;er &s;ort of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> re&s;olved to oppo&s;e this all they could, and to proceed with Temper and Moderation: The Parliament there was opened with Speeches and Addre&s;&s;es, that carried the Complements to the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> &s;o far, as if no other Per&s;on be&s;ides him&s;elf, could have given them that Settlement, which they expected from his Government. The Tru&s;tees had rai&s;ed a Scandal upon that Nation, as if they de&s;igned to &s;et up an Independance upon <HI>England:</HI> &s;o they began the Se&s;&s;ion with a Vote, di&s;claiming that, as fal&s;e and injurious. They expre&s;&s;ed on all Occa&s;ions their hatred of the Tru&s;tees and of their Proceedings, yet they would not pre&s;ume to meddle with any thing they had done, pur&s;uant to the Act, that had pa&s;s'd in <HI>England,</HI> which ve&s;ted the Tru&s;t in them. They offer|ed the nece&s;&s;ary Supplies, but took Exceptions to the Accounts, that were laid before them, and ob&s;erved &s;ome Errors in them. This begat an Unea&s;ine&s;s in the Duke of <HI>Ormond;</HI> for tho' he was ge|nerous, and above all &s;ordid Practices, yet being a Man of Plea|&s;ure, he was much in the power of tho&s;e, who acted under him, and who&s;e Integrity was not &s;o clear. One great De&s;ign of the wi&s;er among them was, to break the Power of Popery, and the Intere&s;t, that the Heads of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Families had among them:
<PB N="361" REF="387">
They enacted the Succe&s;&s;ion of the Crown, to follow the Pattern &s;et them by <HI>England,</HI> in every particular: They al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed an Act concerning Papi&s;ts, &s;omewhat like that which had pa&s;&s;ed in <HI>Eng|land</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Act pa&s;&s;ed there again&s;t Pa|pery.</NOTE> three Years before; but with &s;ome more effectual Clau&s;es, for the want of which, we have not yet had any Fruit from that Act: The main Difference was that, which made it look le&s;s invidious, and yet was more effectual, for breaking the Dependance on the Heads of Families: For it was provided, that all E&s;tates &s;hould be equally divided among the Children of Papi&s;ts, notwith&s;tanding any Settlements to the contrary, unle&s;s the Per&s;ons, on whom they were &s;ettled, qualified them&s;elves by taking the Oaths, and coming to the Communion of the Church: This &s;eemed to carry no Hard|&s;hip to the Family in general, and yet gave hopes of weakning that Intere&s;t &s;o con&s;iderably, that the Bill was offered to the Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> pre&s;&s;ing him, with more than u&s;ual Vehemence, to inter|ceed &s;o effectually, that it might be returned back under the Great Seal of <HI>England.</HI> They under&s;tood, that the Papi&s;ts of <HI>Ireland</HI> had rai&s;ed a con&s;iderable Sum, to be &s;ent over to <HI>England,</HI> to &s;upport their Practices, in order to the &s;topping this Bill: It came over, warmly recommended by the Duke of <HI>Ormond:</HI> But it was as warmly oppo&s;ed by tho&s;e, who had a mind to have a &s;hare in the Pre&s;ents, that were ready to be made. The Pretence for oppo&s;ing it was, that while the Queen was &s;o deeply engaged with the Em|peror, and was interceeding for Favour to the Prote&s;tants in his Do|minions; it &s;eemed not &s;ea&s;onable, and was &s;carce decent, to pa&s;s &s;o &s;evere a Law again&s;t tho&s;e of his Religion: Tho' this had the le&s;s Strength, &s;ince it was very evident, that all the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Papi&s;ts were in the <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;t, &s;o there was no rea&s;on to apprehend that the Emperor could be much concerned for them. The Par|liament of <HI>England</HI> was &s;itting when this Bill came over, and Mens Eyes were much &s;et on the I&s;&s;ue of it: So that the Mini&s;ters judged, it was not &s;afe to deny it: But a Clau&s;e was added, which they hoped would hinder its being accepted in <HI>Ireland.</HI> That Matter was carried on &s;o &s;ecretly, that it was known to none, but tho&s;e who were at the Council, till the News of it came from <HI>Ireland,</HI> upon its being &s;ent thither: The Clau&s;e was to this purpo&s;e, that none in <HI>Ireland</HI> &s;hould be capable of any Employment, or of being in the Magi&s;tracy in any City, who did not qualify them&s;elves by receiving the Sacrament, according to the Te&s;t-Act pa&s;&s;ed in <HI>Eng|land;</HI> which before this time had never been offered to the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Nation. It was hoped by tho&s;e, who got this Clau&s;e to be added to the Bill, that tho&s;e in <HI>Ireland</HI> who promoted it mo&s;t, would now be the le&s;s fond of it, when it had &s;uch a Weight hung to it: The greate&s;t part of <HI>Ul&s;ter</HI> was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Scotch,</HI> who adhered &s;tiffly to their fir&s;t Education in <HI>Scotland:</HI> And they were &s;o united
<PB N="362" REF="388">
in that way, that it was believed they could not find &s;uch a number of Men, who would qualify them&s;elves, as was nece&s;&s;ary by this Clau&s;e, to maintain the Order and Ju&s;tice of the Country. Yet upon this occa&s;ion the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Parliament proceeded with great Cau|tion and Wi&s;dom: They reckoned that this Act, &s;o far as it related to Papi&s;ts, would have a certain and great effect, for their common Security: And that when it was once pa&s;s'd, it would never be re|pealed: Whereas if great Inconveniencies did ari&s;e upon this new Clau&s;e, it would be an ea&s;ier thing to obtain a Repeal of it, in a &s;ub|&s;equent Parliament, either of <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Ireland.</HI> So the Act was pa&s;&s;ed, and tho&s;e who thought they had managed the Matter with a Ma&s;ter-piece of Cunning, were outwitted by an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Parliament. However this Artifice, and &s;ome other things in the Duke of <HI>Or|mond</HI>'s Conduct, put them into &s;uch an ill humour, that the Sup|ply Bill was clogged and le&s;&s;ened by many Clau&s;es added to it. The Se&s;&s;ion ended in &s;o much Heat, that it was thought that Par|liament would meet no more, if the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> was con|tinued in the Government.</P>
<P>Thus the Parts of the Government that were thought the mo&s;t <NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> ea&s;ily managed, <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> had of late been put into &s;o much di&s;order, that it might prove no ea&s;y Work to &s;et them again in order: The Government was every where going, as it were, out of joint: Its Nerves and Strength &s;eemed to be much &s;lackened: The tru&s;ting and imploying, not only violent Tories, but even known <HI>Jacobites,</HI> as it brought a Weakne&s;s on the Management, &s;o it rai&s;ed a Jealou&s;y, that could not be ea&s;ily cured. Stories were confidently vented, and by &s;ome ea&s;ily believed, that the Queen was convinced of the Wrong done her pretended Brother, and that &s;he was willing to put Affairs in the hands of Per&s;ons, who favoured his Succe&s;&s;ion: It was al&s;o ob&s;erved, that our Court kept to cold Civilities with the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover,</HI> and did nothing that was tender or cordial looking that way: Nor were any imployed, who had expre&s;&s;ed a particular Zeal for their Intere&s;ts. The&s;e things gave great Jealou&s;y: All that was &s;aid in excu&s;e for tru&s;ting &s;uch Per&s;ons, was, that it was fit once to try if good U&s;age could $span$ten them, and bring them entirely into the Queen's Intere&s;ts: And A&s;&s;urances were given, that, if upon a trial, the effect hoped $word$ did not follow, they &s;hould be again di&s;mi&s;s'd.</P>
<P>This was the State of our Affairs when a new Se&s;&s;ion of Parlia|ment was opened in <HI>November:</HI> The Queen, in her Speech ex|pre&s;&s;ed a great Zeal, for carrying on the War, and with relation to the Affairs of <HI>Europe:</HI> She recommended Union and good Agree|ment to all her People; &s;he &s;aid &s;he wanted Words to expre&s;s, how earne&s;tly &s;he de&s;ired this. This was under&s;tood, as an Intimation of her De&s;ire, that there &s;hould be no further Proceeding in the
<PB N="363" REF="389">
Bill again&s;t Occa&s;ional Conformity: Addre&s;&s;es full of Re&s;pect were made to the Queen, in return to her Speech; and the Lords, in theirs, promi&s;ed to avoid every thing, that &s;hould occa&s;ion Di&s;-union or Contention: But nothing could lay the Heat of a Party, which was wrought on by &s;ome, who had De&s;igns, that were to be denied or di&s;gui&s;ed, till a proper time for owning them &s;hould appear. A Motion was made in the Hou&s;e of Commons, for bringing in the Bill again&s;t Occa&s;ional Conformity: Great Oppo&s;ition was made to <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Bill again&s;t Occa&s;ional Confor|mity.</NOTE> it; the Court was again&s;t it, but it was carried by a great Majority, that &s;uch a Bill &s;hould be brought in. So a new Draught was for|med: In it the Preamble, that was in the former Bill, was left out. The Number be&s;ides the Family, that made a Conventicle, was en|larged from Five to Twelve: And the Fine &s;et on tho&s;e, who went to Conventicles, after they had received the Sacrament, be&s;ides the lo&s;s of their Employment, was brought down to Fifty Pound: The&s;e were Artifices, by which it was hoped, upon &s;uch Softnings, once to carry the Bill on any Terms: And when that point was gained, it would be ea&s;y afterwards to carry other Bills of greater Severity. There was now &s;uch a Divi&s;ion upon this Matter, that it was fairly debated in the Hou&s;e of Commons: Whereas before, it went there with &s;uch a Torrent, that no Oppo&s;ition to it could be hearkened to. Tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed the Bill went chiefly upon this ground, that this Bill put the Di&s;&s;enters in a wor&s;e Condition, than they were before: So it was a Breach made upon the Toleration, which ought not to be done, &s;ince they had not de&s;erved it by any ill Behaviour of theirs, by which it could be pretended that they had forfeited any of the Benefits, de&s;igned by that Act: Things of this kind could have no effect, but to imbroil us with new Di&s;|tractions, and to di&s;gu&s;t Per&s;ons well affected to the Queen and her Government: It was nece&s;&s;ary to continue the happy Quiet, that we were now in, e&s;pecially in this time of War, in which even the &s;e|vere&s;t of Per&s;ecutors made their Stops, for fear of irritating ill Hu|mours too much. The old Topicks of Hypocri&s;y, and of the Dan|ger the Church was in, were brought up again on behalf of the Bill, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Pa&s;s'd in Common.</NOTE> and the Bill pa&s;&s;ed in the Hou&s;e of Commons by a great Majority: And &s;o it was &s;ent up to the Lords, where it occa&s;ioned one De|bate of many Hours, whether the Bill &s;hould be entertained and read a &s;econd time, or be thrown out: The Prince appeared no more for it, nor did he come to the Hou&s;e upon this occa&s;ion: Some who had voted for it, in the former Se&s;&s;ion, kept out of the Hou&s;e, and others owned they &s;aw farther into the De&s;ign of the Bill, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">But rejected by the Lords.</NOTE> &s;o voted again&s;t it. Upon a Divi&s;ion it was carried, by a Majority of Twelve, not to give it a &s;econd Reading, but to reject it.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hops were almo&s;t equally divided: There were two more again&s;t it, than for it: Among the&s;e, I had the large&s;t &s;hare of
<PB N="364" REF="390">
Cen&s;ure on me, becau&s;e I &s;poke much again&s;t the Bill: I knew how the Act of Te&s;t was carried, as has been already &s;hewn in its proper place: I related that in the Hou&s;e, and the many Practices of the Papi&s;ts, of &s;etting us of the Church again&s;t the Di&s;&s;enters, and the Di&s;&s;enters again&s;t us by turns, as it might &s;erve their ends: I ventured to &s;ay, that a Man might lawfully communicate with a Church, that he thought had a Wor&s;hip and a Doctrine uncorrupted, and yet communicate more frequently with a Church, that he thought more perfect: I my&s;elf had communicated with the Churches of <HI>Geneva</HI> and <HI>Holland;</HI> and yet at the &s;ame time com|municated with the Church of <HI>England:</HI> So, tho' the Di&s;&s;enters were in a Mi&s;take, as to their Opinion, which was the more per|fect Church, yet allowing them a Toleration in that Error, this Practice might be ju&s;tified. I was de&s;ired to print what I &s;aid upon that occa&s;ion, which drew many virulent Pamphlets upon me, but I an&s;wered none of them: I &s;aw the <HI>Jacobites</HI> de&s;igned to rai&s;e &s;uch a Flame among us, as might make it &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to carry on the War; tho&s;e who went not &s;o deep, yet de&s;igned to make a Breach on the Toleration by gaining this Point: And I was re&s;olved never to be &s;ilent, when that &s;hould be brought into debate: For I have long looked on Liberty of Con&s;cience, as one of the Rights of Hu|man Nature, antecedent to Society, which no Man could give up, becau&s;e it was not in his own power: And our Saviour's Rule, of doing as we would be done by, &s;eemed to be a very expre&s;s Deci|&s;ion to all Men, who would lay the Matter home to their own Con|&s;cience, and judge as they would willingly be judged by others.</P>
<P>The Clergy over <HI>England,</HI> who were generally inflamed with <NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> this Matter, could hardly forgive the Queen and the Prince, the Coldne&s;s that they expre&s;&s;ed on this occa&s;ion: The Lord <HI>Godolphin</HI> did &s;o po&s;itively declare, that he thought the Bill un&s;ea&s;onable, and that he had done all he could, to hinder its being brought in, that tho' he voted to give the Bill a &s;econd Reading, that did not re|concile the Party to him: They &s;et up the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> as the only Man to be depended on, who de&s;erved to be the chief Mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of Commons gave all the Supplies, that were nece&s; <NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> &s;ary, for carrying on the War: Some tried to tack the Bill again&s;t Occa&s;ional Conformity to the Bill of Supply, but they had not Strength to carry it: The Commons &s;hewed a very unu&s;ual Neg|lect of all that related to the Fleet, which was wont to be one of their chief Cares: It was &s;urmized, that they &s;aw, that if they opened that Door, Di&s;coveries would be made of Errors that could neither be ju&s;tified nor palliated, and that the&s;e mu&s;t come home chiefly to their greate&s;t Favourites; &s;o they avoided all Examina+tions, that would probably draw &s;ome Cen&s;ure on them.</P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="391">
The Lords were not &s;o tender: They found great Fault with the Coun&s;els, chiefly with the &s;ending <HI>Shovell</HI> to the Mediterranean, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Enquiries into the Conduct of the Fleet.</NOTE> and <HI>Graydon</HI> to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies:</HI> And laid all the Di&s;coveries, that were made to them, with their own Ob&s;ervations on them, before the Queen, in Addre&s;&s;es that were very plain, tho' full of all due Re&s;pect: They went on likewi&s;e, in their Examinations of the out|cry made of the Wa&s;te of the publick Trea&s;ure in the la&s;t Reign; they examined the Earl of <HI>Orford</HI>'s Accounts, which amounted to &s;eventeen Millions, and upon which &s;ome Ob&s;ervations had been made by the Commi&s;&s;ioners, for examining the publick Accounts; they found them all to be fal&s;e in Fact, or ill grounded, and of no Importance.</P>
<P>The only Particular, that &s;eemed to give a ju&s;t Colour to Excep|tion, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earl of <HI>$span$s</HI> Accounts ju&s;tified</NOTE> was very &s;trictly examined: He had victualled the Fleet, while they lay all Winter at <HI>Cadiz:</HI> the Pur&s;ers Receipts for the Quantity, that was laid into every Ship, were produced, but they had no Re|ceipts of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> from whom they had bought the Provi|&s;ions; but they had entred the Prices of them in their own Books, and the&s;e were given in upon Oath. This Matter had been much canva&s;&s;ed in the late King's Time, and it &s;tood thus: <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> now Earl of <HI>Orford,</HI> when he had been ordered to he at <HI>Cadiz,</HI> wrote to the Board of Victualling, to &s;end one over to provide the Fleet; they an&s;wered, that their Credit was then &s;o low, that they could not undertake it: &s;o he was de&s;ired to do it upon his own Credit. It appeared, that no Fleet nor &s;ingle Ship had ever been victualled &s;o cheap, as the Fleet was then by him: It was not the cu&s;tom in <HI>Spain</HI> to give Receipts; but if any Fraud had been intended, it would have been ea&s;y to have got the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> after they had their Money, to have &s;igned any Receipts, that could have been offered them, for &s;welling up the Accounts; for the Practices of &s;welling Accounts, in their dealings with their own Court, were well known there. Upon the&s;e Rea&s;ons, the Lords of the Trea&s;ury had pa&s;s'd his Accounts, and were of opinion that he had done a great Service to the Government, in that whole Tran&s;action. The Hou&s;e of Lords did now confirm this; and ordered an Account of that whole matter to be printed.</P>
<P>The Commons made no progre&s;s in any Di&s;coveries of ill Practices in the Earl of <HI>Ranclagh</HI>'s Office, but concluded that matter with an Addre&s;s to the Queen, that &s;he would order a Pro&s;ecution. This was an Artifice to make the Nation &s;till think, that great Di&s;coveries of Corruption might be made, if carefully look'd after: It was expected, after &s;uch an Outcry as they had made, and after the expence the Nation was put to, for this Commi&s;&s;ion, and the extra|ordinary Powers that were lodged with the Commi&s;&s;ioners, that at lea&s;t &s;ome important Di&s;coveries &s;hould have been made by them.</P>
<P><PB N="366" REF="392">
The Commons &s;ent up a Bill to the Lords, for continuing the <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Bill for examining the publick Accounts lo&s;t between the two Hou&s;es.</NOTE> Commi&s;&s;ion another Year: It was ob&s;erved that an Alteration was made of the Per&s;ons; &s;ome who expected better Places, got their Names to be left out. The Lords excepted to one <HI>Bierly,</HI> who was named to be one of the Commi&s;&s;ioners; becau&s;e he had been a Co|lonel, and had not yet cleared the Accounts of his own Regiment: &s;o they &s;truck out his Name, and named another; and they added two more, who were not Members of the Hou&s;e of Commons. The rea&s;on of this was, becau&s;e the Members of that Hou&s;e would not appear before them, to explain &s;ome Particulars; they only &s;ent their Clerk, to inform them, and when the Lords &s;ent a Me&s;&s;age to the Hou&s;e of Commons, to de&s;ire them to order their Members to attend on their Committee, all the return they had was, that they would &s;end an an&s;wer, by Me&s;&s;engers of their own: but this was illu&s;ory, for they &s;ent no &s;uch Me&s;&s;age. So the Lords thought it nece&s;&s;ary, in order to their being better informed, to put &s;ome in the Commi&s;&s;ion for the future, who &s;hould be bound to attend upon them, as out as they &s;hould be called for. The Commons rejected the&s;e Amendments; and pretended that this was of the Nature of a Money-Bill, and that therefore the Lords could make no Altera|tions in it. The Me&s;&s;age, that the Commons &s;ent the Lords upon this Head, came &s;o near the End of the Se&s;&s;ion, that the Lords could not return an An&s;wer to it, with the Rea&s;ons for which they in&s;i&s;ted on their Amendments; &s;o that Bill fell.</P>
<P>The Charge of this Commi&s;&s;ion amounted to Eight Thou&s;and Pounds a-year; the Commi&s;&s;ioners made much noi&s;e, and brought many Per&s;ons before them to be examined, and gave great di&s;tur|bance to all the Publick Offices, what by their Attendance on them, what by copying out all their Books for their Peru&s;al; and yet in a Cour&s;e of many Years, they had not made any one Di&s;covery: &s;o a full &s;top was put to this way of proceeding.</P>
<P>An Incident happened during this Se&s;&s;ion, which may have great <NOTE PLACE="marg">A D$span$ co$span$ In$span$ the Elections of Members of Parlia|ment.</NOTE> Con&s;equences, tho' in it &s;elf it might &s;eem incon&s;iderable: There have been great Complaints long made, and the&s;e have increa&s;ed much within the&s;e few Years, of great Partiality and Inju&s;tice in the Elections of Parliament-Men, both by Sheriffs in Counties, and by the returning Officers in Burroughs. In <HI>Aylesbury,</HI> the Return was made by four Con&s;tables, and it was believed, that they made a bargain with &s;ome of the Candidates, and then managed the Mat|ter, &s;o as to be &s;ure, that the Majority &s;hould be for the Per&s;on, to whom they had engaged them&s;elves; they canva&s;&s;ed about the Town, to know how the Voters were &s;et, and they re&s;olved to find &s;ome Pretence for di&s;abling tho&s;e, who were engaged to vote for other Per&s;ons than their Friends, that they might be &s;ure to have the Majority in their own hands. And when this Matter came to
<PB N="367" REF="393">
be examined by the Hou&s;e of Commons, they gave the Election al|ways for him who was reckoned of the Party of the Majority, in a manner &s;o barefaced, that they were &s;carce out of countenance, when they were charged for Inju&s;tices in judging Elections. It was not ea&s;y to find a Remedy, to &s;uch a crying Abu&s;e, of which all &s;ides in their turns, as they happened to be depre&s;&s;ed, had made great Complaints; but when they came to be the Majority, &s;eemed to have forgot all, that they had formerly cried out on. Some few excu&s;ed this, on the Topick of Retaliation; they &s;aid, they dealt with others as they had dealt with them, or their Friends. At la&s;t an Action was brought again&s;t the Con&s;tables of <HI>Aylcsbury,</HI> at the Suit of one, who had been always admitted to vote in former Elec|tions, but was denied it in the la&s;t Election. This was tried at the <HI>A&s;&s;izes,</HI> and it was found there by the Jury, that the Con&s;tables had denied him a Right, of which he was undoubtedly in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;o they were to be ca&s;t in Damages; but it was moved in the Queen's Bench, to qua&s;h all the Proceedings in that Matter, &s;ince no Action did lie or had ever been brought upon that account. <HI>Powel, Gould</HI> and <HI>Powis</HI> were of opinion, that no Hurt was done the Man; that the judging of Elections belonged to the Hou&s;e of Commons; that as this Action was the fir&s;t of its kind, &s;o if it was allowed, it would bring on an Infinity of Suits, and put all the Officers, concerned in that Matter, upon great Difficulties: Lord Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Holt,</HI> tho' alone, yet differed from the re&s;t; he thought this was a Matter of the greate&s;t Importance, both to the whole Na|tion in general, and to every Man in his own particular; he made a great Difference between an Election of a Member, and a Right to vote in it; the Hou&s;e of Commons were the only Judges of the former, whether it was rightly managed or not, without Bribery, Fraud or Violence; but the Right of voting in an Election, was an original Right founded either on a Freehold of Forty Shillings a-year in the County; or on Burgageland, or upon a Pre&s;crip|tion, or by Charter, in a Burrough: The&s;e were all legal Titles, and as &s;uch were triable in a Court of Law. Acts of Parliament were made concerning them, and by rea&s;on of the&s;e, every thing relating to tho&s;e Acts, was triable in a Court of Law; he &s;poke long and learnedly, and with &s;ome Vehemence upon the Subject; but he was one again&s;t three, &s;o the Order of the Court went, in favour of the Con&s;tables. The Matter was upon that brought before the Hou&s;e of Lords, by a Writ of Error; the Ca&s;e was very fully argued at the Bar, and the Judges were ordered to deliver their Opinions up|on it, which they did very copiou&s;ly.</P>
<P>Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Trevor</HI> in&s;i&s;ted much, on the Authority that the Hou&s;e of Commons had, to judge of all tho&s;e Elections; from that he inferred, that they only could judge who were the Electors: Petitions were often grounded on this, that in the Poll &s;ome were
<PB N="368" REF="394">
admitted to a Vote, who had no Right to it, and that others were denied it, who had a Right; &s;o that in &s;ome Ca&s;es they were the pro|per Judges of this Right: And if they had it in &s;ome Ca&s;es, they mu&s;t have it in all. From this he inferred, that every thing relating to this Matter was triable by them, and by them only; if two inde|pendent Juri&s;dictions might have the &s;ame Ca&s;e brought before them, they might give contrary Judgments in it; and this mu&s;t breed great Di&s;traction, in the Execution of tho&s;e Judgments.</P>
<P>To all this it was an&s;wered, that a &s;ingle Man, who was wronged in this Matter, had no other Remedy but by bringing it into a Court of Law; for the Hou&s;e of Commons could not examine the Right of every Voter; if the Man, for whom he would have voted, was returned, he could not be heard to complain to the Hou&s;e of Commons, tho' in his own Particular he was denied a Vote, &s;ince he could not make any Exceptions to the Return; &s;o he mu&s;t bear his Wrong, without a Remedy, if he could not bring it into a Court of Law. A Right of voting in an Election was the greate&s;t of all the Rights of an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> &s;ince by that he was repre&s;ented in Parliament; the Hou&s;e of Commons could give no Relief to a Man wronged in this, nor any Damages; they could only &s;et a&s;ide one, and admit of another Return; but this was no Redre&s;s to him, that &s;uffered the Wrong; it made him to be the le&s;s con&s;idered in his Burrough, and that might be a real Damage to him in his Trade: &s;ince this was a Right, inherent in a Man, it &s;eemed rea&s;onable that it &s;hould be brought, where all other Rights were tried, into a Court of Law; the Abu&s;e was new, and was daily growing, and it was already &s;welled to a great heighth; when new Di&s;orders hap|pen, new Actions mu&s;t lie, otherwi&s;e there is a Failure in Ju&s;tice, which all Laws abhor; Practices of this &s;ort were enormous and crying; and if the Rule made in the Queen's Bench was affirmed, it would very much encrea&s;e the&s;e Di&s;orders, by this Indemnity, that &s;eemed to be given to the Officers, who took the Poll.</P>
<P>After a long Debate, it was carried by a great Majority to &s;et a|&s;ide <NOTE PLACE="marg">The $word$ $span$ Law.</NOTE> the Order in the Queen's Bench, and to give Judgment ac|cording to the Verdict given at the A&s;&s;izes. This gave great Offence to the Hou&s;e of Commons, who pa&s;&s;ed very high Votes upon it, a|gain&s;t the Man of <HI>Aylesbury,</HI> as guilty of a Breach of their Privi|ledges, and again&s;t all others who &s;hould for the future bring any &s;uch Suits into Courts of Law; and likewi&s;e again&s;t all Council, Attorneys and others, who &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t in any &s;uch Suits; and they affirmed, that the whole Matter relating to Elections belonged only to them: yet they did not think fit to &s;end for the Man, who had &s;ued, or rather in who&s;e Name the Suit was carried on; &s;o they let the Matter as to him fall, under a &s;hew of Moderation and Pity, and let it re&s;t upon tho&s;e general Votes. The Lords on their part ordered the whole State of the Ca&s;e to be drawn up and printed,
<PB N="369" REF="395">
which was done with much Learning and Judgment; they al&s;o a&s;|&s;erted the Right, that all the People of <HI>England</HI> had, to &s;eek for Ju&s;tice in Courts of Law, upon all &s;uch Occa&s;ions; and that the Hou&s;e of Commons, by their Votes, &s;truck at the Liberties of the People, at the Law of <HI>England,</HI> and at the Judicature of the Hou&s;e of Lords; and they ordered the Lord Keeper to &s;end a Copy of the Ca&s;e, and of their Votes to all the Sheriffs of <HI>England,</HI> to be com|municated to all the Boroughs in their Counties. The Hou&s;e of Com|mons was much provoked with this, but they could not hinder it; the Thing was popular, and the Lords got great Credit, by the Judg|ment they gave, which let the People of <HI>England</HI> &s;ee, how they might be redre&s;&s;ed for the future, if they &s;hould meet with the In|ju&s;tice, the Partiality and other ill Practices, that had appeared of late in Elections, even beyond the Examples of former Times. This may prove a Re&s;traint on the Officers, now that they &s;ee they are liable to be &s;ued, and that a Vote of the Hou&s;e of Commons cannot cover them.</P>
<P>During the Se&s;&s;ion and on her own Birth-day, which was the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen gave the Tenths and Fir&s;t-fruits for the Be|nefit of the poor Clergy.</NOTE> &s;ixth of <HI>February,</HI> the Queen &s;ent a Me&s;&s;age to the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, &s;ignifying her Purpo&s;e, to apply that Branch of the Revenue, that was rai&s;ed out of the Fir&s;t-Fruits and Tenths, payed by the Clergy, to the encrea&s;e of all the &s;mall Benefices in the Nation: This Branch was an Impo&s;ition, begun by the Popes, in the Time of the Holy Wars, and it was rai&s;ed as a Fund to &s;upport tho&s;e Ex|peditions: But when Taxes are once rai&s;ed by &s;uch an Arbitrary Power, as the Popes then a&s;&s;umed, and after there has been a Sub|mi&s;&s;ion, and the Payments have been &s;ettled into a Cu&s;tom, they are always continued, even after the Pretence, upon which they were at fir&s;t rai&s;ed, &s;ub&s;i&s;ts no more: So this became a &s;tanding Branch of the Papal Revenue, 'till <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth &s;eemed re&s;olved to take it away: It was fir&s;t aboli&s;hed for a Year, probably to draw in the Clergy, to con&s;ent the more willingly to a Change, that de|livered them from &s;uch heavy Impo&s;itions: But in the &s;ucceeding Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, this Revenue was again &s;ettled as Part of the Income of the Crown for ever. It is true, it was the more ea&s;ily born, becau&s;e the Rates were &s;till at the old Value, which in &s;ome Places was not the tenth, and in mo&s;t not above the fifth Part of the true Value: And the Clergy had been often threatened with a new Valuation, in which the Rates &s;hould be rigorou&s;ly &s;et to their full Extent.</P>
<P>The Tenths amounted to about 11000 <HI>l.</HI> a-year, and the Fir&s;t-Fruits, which were more ca&s;ual, ro&s;e one Year with another, to 5000 <HI>l.</HI> &s;o the whole amounted to between Sixteen and Seventeen Thou&s;and Pounds a-year: This was not brought into the Trea&s;ury, as the other Branches of the Revenue; but the Bi&s;hops, who had been the Pope's Collectors, were now the King's, &s;o Per&s;ons in &s;a|vour
<PB N="370" REF="396">
obtained A&s;&s;ignations on them, for Life or for a Term of Years: This had never been applied to any good u&s;e, but was &s;till obtained by Favourites, for them&s;elves and their Friends: And in King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second's Time, it went chiefly among his Women and his Natural Children. It &s;eemed &s;trange, that while the Clergy had much Credit at Court, they had never repre&s;ented this, as Sacri|lege, unle&s;s it was applied to &s;ome Religious Purpo&s;e, and that during Archbi&s;hop <HI>Laud</HI>'s Favour with King <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t, or at the Re&s;tauration of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, no Endeavours had been u&s;ed to appropriate this to better U&s;es: Sacrilege was charged on other things, on very &s;light Grounds; but this, which was more vi&s;ible, was always forgot.</P>
<P>When I wrote the Hi&s;tory of the Reformation, I con&s;idered this Matter &s;o particularly, that I &s;aw here was a proper Fund, for pro|viding better Sub&s;i&s;tence to the poor Clergy; we having among us &s;ome Hundreds of Cures, that have not of certain Provi&s;ion Twenty Pounds a-year; and &s;ome Thou&s;ands, that have not Fifty: Where the Encouragement is &s;o &s;mall, what can it be expected, Clergymen &s;hould be? It is a crying Scandal, that at the Re&s;tauration of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, the Bi&s;hops and other Dignitaries, who rai&s;ed much above a Million in Fines, yet did &s;o little this way: I had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the late Queen with this, &s;o that &s;he was fully re&s;olved, if ever &s;he had lived to &s;ee Peace and Settlement, to have cleared this Branch of the Revenue, of all the A&s;&s;ignations, that were upon it, and to have applied it to the Augmentation of &s;mall Benefices. This is plainly in&s;inuated, in the E&s;&s;ay that I wrote on her Memory, &s;ome time after her Death. I laid the Matter before the late King, when there was a Pro&s;pect of Peace, as a proper Expre&s;&s;ion both of his Thankfulne&s;s to Almighty God, and of his Care of the Church; I hoped that this might have gained the Hearts of the Clergy: It might at lea&s;t have put a &s;top to a groundle&s;s Clamour rai&s;ed again&s;t him, that he was an Enemy to the Clergy, which began then to have a very ill effect on all his Affairs. He entertained this &s;o well, that he ordered me to &s;peak to his Mini&s;ters about it: They all ap|proved it, the Lord <HI>Somers</HI> and the Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> did it, in a mo&s;t particular manner: But the Earl of <HI>Sunderland</HI> obtained an A&s;&s;ig|nation, upon two Dioce&s;es, for Two Thou&s;and Pound a-year for two Lives; &s;o nothing was to be hoped for after that. I laid this Matter very fully before the pre&s;ent Queen, in the King's time, and had &s;poken often of it to the Lord <HI>Godolphin.</HI></P>
<P>This Time was perhaps cho&s;en, to pacify the angry Clergy, who were di&s;&s;atisfied with the Court, and began now to talk of the Dan|ger the Church was in, as much as they had done during the former Reign: This extraordinary Mark of the Queen's Piety and Zeal for the Church, produced many Addre&s;&s;es, full of Complements, but it has not yet had any great effect, in &s;oftening the Tempers of
<PB N="371" REF="397">
peevi&s;h Men. When the Queen's Me&s;&s;age was brought to the Hou&s;e of Commons, &s;ome of the Whigs, particularly Sir <HI>John Holland</HI> and Sir <HI>Jo&s;eph Jekyll,</HI> moved that the Clergy might be entirely freed from that Tax, &s;ince they bore as heavy a Share of other Taxes; and that another Fund might be rai&s;ed of the &s;ame Value, out of which &s;mall Benefices might be augmented: But this was violently oppo&s;ed by <HI>Mu&s;grave,</HI> and other Tories, who &s;aid the Clergy ought to be kept &s;till in a Dependance on the Crown.</P>
<P>Upon the Queen's Me&s;&s;age, a Bill was brought in, enabling her to <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Act pa&s;|&s;ed abo$&punc; $word$.</NOTE> alienate this Branch of the Revenue, and to create a Corporation by Charter, to apply it to the u&s;e for which &s;he now gave it: They added to this a Repeal of the Statute of <HI>Mortmain,</HI> &s;o far as that it might be free to all Men, either by Deed or by their la&s;t Wills, to give what they thought fit towards the augmenting of Benefices: It was &s;ugge&s;ted, how truly I cannot tell, that this Addition was made in hope that it would be rejected by the Lords, and that the Scandal of lo&s;ing the Bill might lie on them. It occa&s;ioned a great Debate in the Hou&s;e of Lords: It was &s;aid, that this Law was made and kept up even during the Times of Popery, and it &s;eemed not rea&s;onable to open a Door to Practices upon dying Men. It was an&s;wered, that we had not the Arts of affrighting Men by the Terrors of Purgatory, or by Fables of Apparitions: Where the&s;e were practi&s;ed, it was very rea&s;onable to re&s;train Prie&s;ts from tho&s;e Artifices, by which they had &s;o enriched their Church, that with|out &s;ome &s;uch effectual Checks they would have &s;wallowed up the whole Wealth of the World, as they had indeed in <HI>England,</HI> during Popery, made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of a full third part of the Nation. The Bi&s;hops were &s;o zealous and unanimous for the Bill, that it was carried and pa&s;&s;ed into a Law. The Queen was plea&s;ed to let it be known, that the fir&s;t Motion of this Matter came from me: Such a Project would have been much magnified at another time; and tho&s;e, who had promoted it, would have been looked on as the true&s;t Friends of the Church: But this did not &s;eem to make any great Impre&s;&s;ion at that time; only it produced a Set of Addre&s;&s;es, from all the Clergy of <HI>England,</HI> full of Thanks and ju&s;t Acknow|ledgments.</P>
<P>I come now, in the la&s;t place, to give the Relation of the Di&s;cove|ries <NOTE PLACE="marg">A P$span$ di&s;|covered</NOTE> made of a Plot, which took up much of the Lords Time, and gave occa&s;ion to many &s;harp Reflections, that pa&s;s'd between the two Hou&s;es in their Addre&s;&s;es to the Queen. About the &s;ame time that the Story of <HI>Frazier</HI>'s Pa&s;s and Negotiations began to break out, Sir <HI>John Macclean</HI> a Papi&s;t, and the Head of that Tribe or Clan in the Highlands and We&s;tern I&s;les of <HI>Scotland,</HI> came over from <HI>France</HI> in a little Boat, and landed &s;ecretly at <HI>Folk&s;ton</HI> in <HI>Kent:</HI> He brought his Lady with him, tho' &s;he had been delivered of a Child, but eleven Days before. He was taken, and &s;ent up to <HI>London;</HI> and
<PB N="372" REF="398">
it &s;eemed, by all Circum&s;tances, that he came over upon &s;ome im|portant De&s;ign: He pretended at fir&s;t, that he came only to go thro' <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> to take the Benefit of the Queen's general Pardon there: But when he was told, that the Pardon in <HI>Scotland</HI> was not a good Warrant to come into <HI>England,</HI> and that it was High-Trea&s;on to come from <HI>France,</HI> without a Pa&s;s, he was not willing to expo&s;e him&s;elf to the Severity of the Law: So he was pre|vailed on to give an account of all that he knew, concerning the Ne|gotiations between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Scotland.</HI> Some others were at the &s;ame time taken up upon his Information, and &s;ome upon Su&s;picion: Among the&s;e there was one <HI>Keith,</HI> who&s;e Uncle was one of tho&s;e, who was mo&s;t tru&s;ted by the Court of <HI>St. Germains,</HI> and whom they had &s;ent over with <HI>Frazier,</HI> to bring them an account of the Tem|per the <HI>Scotch</HI> were in, upon which they might depend. <HI>Keith</HI> had been long at that Court, he had free Acce&s;s both to that Queen and Prince, and hoped they would have made him Under Secretary for <HI>Scotland;</HI> for &s;ome time, he denied that he knew any thing, but afterwards he confe&s;&s;ed he was made acquainted with <HI>Frazier</HI>'s Tran&s;actions, and he undertook to deal with his Uncle to come and di&s;cover all he knew, and pretended there was no other De&s;ign among them, but to lay Matters &s;o, that the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> &s;hould reign after the Queen. <HI>Fergu&s;on</HI> offered him&s;elf to make great Di&s;|coveries: He &s;aid <HI>Frazier</HI> was imployed by the Duke of <HI>Queensbury,</HI> to decoy &s;ome into a Plot, which he had framed and intended to di&s;cover, as &s;oon as he had drawn many into the Guilt: He affirmed that there was no Plot among the <HI>Jacobites,</HI> who were glad to &s;ee one of the Race of the <HI>Stuarts</HI> on the Throne: And they de&s;igned, when the State of the War might di&s;po&s;e the Queen to a Treaty with <HI>France,</HI> to get &s;uch Terms given her, as King <HI>Stephen</HI> and King <HI>Henry</HI> the Sixth had, to reign during her Life. When I heard this, I could not but remember what the Duke of <HI>Athol</HI> had &s;aid to my&s;elf, &s;oon after the Queen's coming to the Crown: I &s;aid, I hoped none in <HI>Scotland</HI> thought of the Prince of <HI>Wales:</HI> He an|&s;wered, he knew none that thought of him as long as the Queen lived: I replied, that if any thought of him after that, I was &s;ure the Queen would live no longer, than till they thought their De&s;igns for him were well laid: But he &s;eemed to have no Apprehen&s;ions of that. I pre&s;ently told the Queen this, without naming the Per&s;on, and &s;he an&s;wered me very quick, there was no manner of doubt of that: But tho' I could not but reflect often on that Di&s;cour&s;e, yet &s;ince it was &s;aid to me in Confidence, I never &s;poke of it to any one Per&s;on, during all the Enquiry, that was now on foot: But I think it too material not to &s;et it down here. <HI>Fergu&s;on</HI> was a Man of a particular Character: Upon the Revolution he had a very good Place given him, but his Spirit was &s;o turned to Plotting, that within a few Months after he turned about, and he has been ever &s;ince the
<PB N="373" REF="399">
bolde&s;t and mo&s;t active Man of the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Party: He pretended he was now for High Church, but many believed him a Papi&s;t: There was Matter of Trea&s;on &s;worn both again&s;t him and <HI>Keith,</HI> but there was only one Witne&s;s to it.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time <HI>Lind&s;ey</HI> was taken up; he had been Under-Secretary fir&s;t to the Earl of <HI>Melfort,</HI> and then to the Earl of <HI>Mid|dletoun;</HI> he had carried over from <HI>France</HI> the Letters and Orders, that gave ri&s;e to the Earl of <HI>Dundee</HI>'s breaking out, the Year after the Revolution; and he had been much tru&s;ted at <HI>St. Germains;</HI> he had a &s;mall E&s;tate in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and he pretended, that he took the Benefit of the Queen's Pardon, and had gone to <HI>Scotland</HI> to &s;ave that; and being &s;ecured by this Pardon, he thought he might come from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England;</HI> but he could pretend no colour for his coming to <HI>England;</HI> &s;o it was not doubted, but that he came hither to manage their Corre&s;pondence and Intrigues. He pretended he knew of no De&s;igns again&s;t the Queen and her Go|vernment; and that the Court of <HI>St. Germains,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Middletoun</HI> in particular, had no De&s;ign again&s;t the Queen; but when he was &s;hewed <HI>Frazier</HI>'s Commi&s;&s;ion to be a Colonel, &s;igned by the pretended King, and counter&s;igned <HI>Middletoun,</HI> he &s;eemed amazed at it; he did not pretend it was a Forgery, but he &s;aid that things of that kind were never communicated to him.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, that the&s;e were taken up, others were taken on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex;</HI> one of the&s;e, <HI>Boucher,</HI> was a chief Officer in the Duke of <HI>Berwick</HI>'s Family, who was then going to <HI>Spain,</HI> but it was &s;u&s;pected that this was a Blind to cover his going to <HI>Scotland;</HI> the Hou&s;e of Lords apprehended, that this Man was &s;ent on great De&s;igns, and &s;u&s;pect|ing a Remi&s;&s;ne&s;s in the Mini&s;try, in looking after and examining tho&s;e, who came from <HI>France,</HI> they made an Addre&s;s to the Queen, that <HI>Boucher</HI> might be well look'd to; they did al&s;o order Sir <HI>John Macclean</HI> to be brought before them; but the Queen, &s;ent them a Me&s;&s;age, that <HI>Macclean</HI>'s Bu&s;ine&s;s was then in a Method of Exami|nation, and that &s;he did not think fit to alter that, for &s;ome time: But as for <HI>Boucher,</HI> and tho&s;e who were taken with him, the Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI> told the Hou&s;e, that they were brought up, and that they might do with them as they plea&s;ed; upon that the Hou&s;e &s;ent back <HI>Macclean,</HI> and ordered the U&s;her of the Black Rod to take the other Pri&s;oners into his Cu&s;tody, and they named a Committee of &s;even Lords to examine them. At this time, the Queen came to the Parliament, and acquainted both Hou&s;es, that &s;he had unque&s;|tionable Proofs of a Corre&s;pondence between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> with which &s;he would acquaint them, when the Examinations were taken.</P>
<P>The Commons were in an ill humour again&s;t the Lords, and &s;o <NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;putes be|tween the two Hou&s;es in $word$ to the Queen.</NOTE> they were glad to find Occa&s;ions to vent it: They thought the Lords ought not to have entred upon this Examination; they complained
<PB N="374" REF="400">
of it as of a new and unheard-of thing, in an Addre&s;s to the Queen; they &s;aid it was an Inva&s;ion of her Prerogative, which they de&s;ired her to exert. This was a Proceeding without a Precedent; the Par|liamentary Method was, when one Hou&s;e was offended with any thing done in the other, Conferences were demanded, in which Matters were freely debated; to begin an Appeal to the Throne was new, and might be managed, by an ill-de&s;igning Prince, &s;o as to end in the Subver&s;ion of the whole Con&s;titution; and it was an amazing thing, to &s;ee a Hou&s;e of Commons affirm, in &s;o pub|lick a manner and &s;o po&s;itively, that the Lords taking Criminals into their own Cu&s;tody, in order to an Examination, was without Warrant or Precedent; when there were &s;o many In&s;tances, fre&s;h in every Man's Memory, e&s;pecially &s;ince the Time of the Popi&s;h Plot, of Precedents in both Hou&s;es, that went much further; of which a full Search has been made, and a long Li&s;t of them was read in the Hou&s;e of Lords. That did not a little confound tho&s;e among them, who were believed to be in a &s;ecret Corre&s;pondence with the Hou&s;e of Commons; they were forced to confe&s;s, that they &s;aw the Lords had clear Precedents to ju&s;tify them, in what they had done, of which they were in great doubt before.</P>
<P>The Lords upon this made a very long Addre&s;s to the Queen, in which they complained of the ill U&s;age they had met with from the Hou&s;e of Commons; they u&s;ed none of tho&s;e hard Words, that were in the Addre&s;s made again&s;t them by the Hou&s;e of Commons, yet they ju&s;tified every Step they had taken, as founded on the Law and Practice of Parliament, and no way contrary to the Duty and Re&s;pect they owed the Queen: The Behaviour of the Hou&s;e of Commons was &s;uch, on this occa&s;ion, as if they had no mind that Plots &s;hould be narrowly looked into; no Hou&s;e of Parliament, and indeed no Court of Judicature, did examine any Per&s;on, without taking him into their own Cu&s;tody, during &s;uch Examination; and if a Per&s;on's being in Cu&s;tody mu&s;t re&s;train a Hou&s;e of Parliament from examining him, here was a Maxim laid down, by which bad Mini&s;ters might cover them&s;elves from any Enquiry into their ill Practices, only by taking the Per&s;ons, who could make Di&s;cove|ries, into Cu&s;tody: The Lords al&s;o &s;et forth the ill Con&s;equences that might follow, upon one Hou&s;e of Parliament carrying their Complaints of another to the Throne, without taking fir&s;t the pro|per Method of Conferences: This Addre&s;s was drawn with the utmo&s;t Force, as well as Beauty and Decency of Stile; and was reckoned one of the be&s;t Pieces of its kind, that were in all the Re|cords of Parliament. The Queen, in her An&s;wer, expre&s;&s;ed a great Concern to &s;ee &s;uch a Di&s;pute, between the two Hou&s;es.</P>
<P><HI>Boucher,</HI> when he was examined, would confe&s;s nothing; he &s;aid, he was weary of living &s;o long out of his Country, and that having made &s;ome Attempt to obtain a Pa&s;s, when that was denied

him, he cho&s;e, rather than to live always abroad, to come and ca&s;t him&s;elf upon the Queen's Mercy; it did not &s;eem rea&s;on|able to believe this; &s;o the Lords made an Addre&s;s to the Queen, that he might have no hopes of Pardon, till he was more &s;incere in his Di&s;coveries; and they prayed that he might be pro&s;ecuted on the Statute: He confe&s;&s;ed his Crime, and was condemned, but con|tinued &s;till denying, that he knew any thing; few could believe this; yet there being no &s;pecial Matter laid again&s;t him, his Ca&s;e was to be pitied; he proved, that he had &s;aved the Lives of many Pri&s;oners, during the War of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and that during the War in <HI>Flanders,</HI> he had been very careful of all <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pri&s;oners: When all this was laid before the Lords, they did not think fit to carry the Matter farther, &s;o he was reprieved, and that Matter &s;lept.</P>
<P>About the end of <HI>January,</HI> the Queen &s;ent the Examinations of the Pri&s;oners to the two Hou&s;es; the Hou&s;e of Commons heard them read, but pa&s;s'd no Judgment upon them, nor did they offer any Advice to the Queen, upon this occa&s;ion; they only &s;ent them back to the Queen, with Thanks for communicating them, and for her Wi&s;dom and Care of the Nation: It was thought &s;trange, to &s;ee a Bu&s;ine&s;s of this nature treated &s;o &s;lightly, by a Body that had looked, in former times, more carefully to things of this kind; e&s;pe|cially &s;ince it had appeared, in many In&s;tances, how dextrous the <HI>French</HI> were in rai&s;ing Di&s;tractions in their Enemies Country: It was evident, that a Negotiation was begun, and had been now carried on for &s;ome time, for an Army that was to be &s;ent from <HI>France</HI> to <HI>Scot|land;</HI> upon this, which was the main of the Di&s;covery, it was very amazing to &s;ee, that the Commons neither offered the Queen any Advice, nor gave her a Vote of Credit, for any extraordinary Ex|pence, in which the Progre&s;s of that Matter might engage her; a Credit &s;o given might have had a great effect, towards defeating the De&s;ign, when it appeared how well the Queen was furni&s;hed to re|&s;i&s;t it: This Coldne&s;s, in the Hou&s;e of Commons, gave great and ju&s;t ground of Su&s;picion, that tho&s;e, who had the chief Credit there, did not act heartily, in order to the defeating all &s;uch Plots, but were willing to let them go on, without Check or Oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The Lords re&s;olved to examine the whole Matter narrowly; the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lords ordered a &s;e|cret Exami|nation of all who were &s;u&s;pected to be in this Plot.</NOTE> Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI> laid before them, an Ab&s;tract of all the Exami|nations, the Council had taken; but &s;ome took great Exceptions to it, as drawn on de&s;ign to make it appear more incon&s;iderable, than they believed it to be: The Sub&s;tance of the whole was, that there went many Me&s;&s;ages between the Courts of <HI>St. Germains</HI> and <HI>Ver|&s;ailles,</HI> with relation to the Affairs of <HI>Scotland;</HI> the Court of <HI>Ver|&s;ailles</HI> was willing to &s;end an Army to <HI>Scotland,</HI> but they de&s;ired to be well a&s;&s;ured of the A&s;&s;i&s;tance they might expect there; in order to which, &s;ome were &s;ent over, according to what <HI>Frazier</HI> had told the Duke of <HI>Queensbury;</HI> &s;ome of the Papers were writ

in Gibberi&s;h, &s;o the Lords moved that a Reward &s;hould be offered, to any who &s;hould decypher the&s;e. When the Lords asked the Earl of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> if every thing was laid before them, he an&s;wered, that there was only one Particular kept from them; becau&s;e they were in hopes of a Di&s;covery, that was like to be of more Con&s;e|quence than all the re&s;t: &s;o after the delay of a few Days, to &s;ee the I&s;&s;ue of it, which was <HI>Keith</HI>'s endeavouring to per&s;uade his Un|cle (who knew every Step that had been made, in the whole Pro|gre&s;s of this Affair) to come in and di&s;cover it, when they were told there was no more hope of that, the Lords ordered the Com|mittee, which had examined <HI>Boucher,</HI> to examine into all the&s;e Di&s;coveries. Upon this the Commons, who expre&s;&s;ed a great un|ea&s;ine&s;s, at every Step the Lords made in the Matter, went with a new Addre&s;s to the Queen, in&s;i&s;ting on their former Complaints, again&s;t the Proceedings of the Lords, as a wre&s;ting the Matter out of the Queen's Hands, and the taking it wholly into their own; and they prayed the Queen to re&s;ume her Prerogative, thus violated by the Lords, who&s;e Proceedings they affirmed to be without a Pre|cedent.</P>
<P>The &s;even Lords went on with their Examinations, and after &s;ome Days they made a Report to the Hou&s;e; <HI>Macclean</HI>'s Confe&s;|&s;ion was the main thing; it was full and particular; he named the Per&s;ons that &s;ate in the Council at <HI>St. Germains;</HI> he &s;aid, the Com|mand was offered to the Duke of <HI>Berwick,</HI> which he declined to accept, till trial was made whether Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> would accept of it, who he thought was the proper Per&s;on; he told likewi&s;e, what Directions had been &s;ent to hinder the &s;ettling the Succe&s;&s;ion in <HI>Scotland;</HI> none of which Particulars were in the Paper, that the Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI> had brought to the Hou&s;e of his Confe&s;&s;ion. It was farther ob&s;erved, that all the re&s;t, who&s;e examinations a|mounted to little, were obliged to write their own Confe&s;&s;ions, or at lea&s;t to &s;ign them: But <HI>Macclean</HI> had not done this; for after he had delivered his Confe&s;&s;ion by Word of Mouth to the Earl of <HI>Not|tingham,</HI> that Lord wrote it all from his Report, and read it to him the next Day; upon which he acknowledged, it contained a full Account of all he had &s;aid. <HI>Macclean</HI>'s Di&s;covery to the Lords was a clear Series of all the Coun&s;els and Me&s;&s;ages, and it gave a full View of the Debates and Opinions in the Council at <HI>St. Germains,</HI> all which was omitted in that, which was taken by the Earl of <HI>Not|tingham,</HI> and his Paper concerning it was both &s;hort and dark; there was an Appearance of Truth, in all that <HI>Macclean</HI> told, and a re|gular Progre&s;s was &s;et forth in it.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e Ob&s;ervations tho&s;e Lords, who were not &s;atisfied with the Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI>'s Paper, intended to have pa&s;&s;ed a Cen&s;ure upon it, as imperfect: It was &s;aid, in the Debate that followed upon this Motion, either <HI>Macclean</HI> was asked, who was to com|mand
<PB N="377" REF="403">
the Army to be &s;ent into <HI>Scotland,</HI> or he was not; if he was asked the Que&s;tion, and had an&s;wered it, then the Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI> had not &s;erved the Queen or u&s;ed the Parliament well, &s;ince he had not put it in the Paper; if it was not asked, here was great Remi&s;&s;ne&s;s in a Mini&s;ter, when it was confe&s;&s;ed, that the &s;ending over an Army was in con&s;ultation, not to ask who was to command that Army. Upon this Occa&s;ion, the Earl of <HI>Torrington</HI> made &s;ome Reflections, that had too deep a Venom in them: He &s;aid, the Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI> did prove, that he had often read over the Paper, in which he had &s;et down <HI>Macclean</HI>'s Confe&s;&s;ion, in his hearing; and had asked him, if all he had con|fe&s;&s;ed to him was not fully &s;et down in that Paper; to which he al|ways an&s;wered, that every thing he had &s;aid was contained in it. Upon this, that Earl ob&s;erved, that <HI>Macclean,</HI> having perhaps told his whole Story to the Earl of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> and finding afterwards, that he had writ &s;uch a defective Account of it, he had rea&s;on to conclude, (for he believed, had he been in his condition, he &s;hould have concluded &s;o him&s;elf,) that the Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI> had no mind, that he &s;hould mention any thing, but what he had writ down, and that he de&s;ired that the re&s;t might be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed: He could not judge of others but by him&s;elf; if his Life had been in danger, and if he were interrogated by a Mini&s;ter of State, who could do him either much Good or much Hurt, and if he had made a full Di&s;covery to him, but had ob&s;erved that this Mini&s;ter, in taking his Confe&s;&s;ion in Writing, had omitted many things, he &s;hould have under&s;tood that, as an Intimation that he was to &s;peak of the&s;e things no more; and &s;o he believed he &s;hould have &s;aid it was all, tho' at the &s;ame time he knew it was not all, that he had &s;aid. It was hereupon moved, that <HI>Macclean</HI> might be &s;ent for and interrogated, but the Party was not &s;trong enough to carry any thing of that kind; and by a previous Vote it was carried, to put no que&s;tion concerning the Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI>'s Paper.</P>
<P>The Lords were highly offended with <HI>Fergu&s;on</HI>'s Paper, and pa&s;s'd a &s;evere Vote again&s;t tho&s;e Lords, who had received &s;uch a &s;candalous Paper from him, and had not ordered him to be pro&s;ecuted upon it; which they directed the Attorney-General to do. It was ap|parent, there was a Train of dangerous Negotiations, that pa&s;&s;ed between <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>St. Germains,</HI> tho' they could not penetrate into the Bottom and Depth of it: And the De&s;ign of <HI>Keith</HI>'s bring|ing in his Uncle, was managed &s;o remi&s;&s;ly, that it was generally con|cluded that it was not in earne&s;t de&s;ired it &s;hould &s;ucceed. During the&s;e Debates, one very extraordinary thing happened: The Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI> did, upon three or four occa&s;ions, affirm, that &s;ome things had been ordered in the Cabnet Council, which the Dukes of <HI>Somer&s;et</HI> and <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> who were likewi&s;e of that Council, did not agree with him in.</P>
<P><PB N="378" REF="404">
After all the&s;e Examinations and Debates, the Lords concluded the whole Matter, with voting that there had been dangerous Plots between &s;ome in <HI>Scotland</HI> and the Court of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>St. Germains;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ Lord&punc; $span$nion up $span$ whole Matter.</NOTE> and that the Encouragement of this Plotting came, from the not &s;ettling the Succe&s;&s;ion to the Crown of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover:</HI> The&s;e Votes they laid before the Queen; and promi&s;ed, that when this was done, they would endeavour to promote the Union of the two Kingdoms, upon ju&s;t and rea&s;onable Terms.</P>
<P>This being ended, they made a long and vigorous Addre&s;s, in an&s;wer to that which the Commons had made again&s;t them: They <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Addre&s;s ju&s;tifying the Pro|ceeding of the Lords.</NOTE> ob&s;erved how unea&s;y the Commons had been at the whole Progre&s;s of their Inquiry into this Matter, and had taken Methods to ob|&s;truct it all they could; which did not &s;hew that Zeal for the Queen's Safety, and the Pre&s;ervation of the Nation, to which all Men pre|tended: They annexed to their Addre&s;s, a Li&s;t of many Prece|dents, to &s;hew what good Warrants they had for every Step they had made: They took not the Examination to them&s;elves, &s;o as to exclude others who had the &s;ame Right, and might have done it as well as they, if they had plea&s;ed: Their Proceedings had been Re|gular and Parliamentary, as well as full of Zeal and Duty to the Queen: They made &s;evere Ob&s;ervations on &s;ome of the Proceedings in the Hou&s;e of Commons, particularly on their not ordering Writs to be i&s;&s;ued out for &s;ome Burroughs, to proceed to new Elections, when they, upon pretence of Corruption, had voted an Election void; which had been practi&s;ed of late, when it was vi&s;ible that the Election would not fall on the Per&s;on they favoured. They charged this as a Denial of Ju&s;tice, and of the Right that &s;uch Burroughs had to be repre&s;ented in Parliament, and as an arbitrary and illegal way of proceeding: This Addre&s;s was penned with great Care and much Force. The&s;e Addre&s;&s;es were drawn by the Lord <HI>Somers,</HI> and were read over and con&s;idered and corrected very criti|cally, by a few Lords, among whom I had the honour to be called for one. This, with the other Papers that were publi&s;hed by the Lords, made a great Impre&s;&s;ion on the Body of the Nation: For the difference that was between the&s;e, and tho&s;e publi&s;hed by the Hou&s;e of Commons, was indeed &s;o vi&s;ible, that it did not admit of any Compari&s;on, and was confe&s;&s;ed even by tho&s;e who were the mo&s;t partial to them.</P>
<P>An Act pa&s;&s;ed in this Se&s;&s;ion, which may be of great advan|tage <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Act for Rec$span$.</NOTE> to the Nation, if well executed; otherwi&s;e, &s;ince it is only enacted for one Year, it will not be of much u&s;e: It impowers the Ju&s;tices of Peace, or any three of them, to take up &s;uch idle Per&s;ons, as have no Callings nor Means of Sub&s;i&s;tence, and to deliver them to the Officers of the Army, upon paying them the Levy Money, that is allowed for making Recruits: The Methods of

rai&s;ing the&s;e hitherto, by drinking and other bad Practices, as they were ju&s;tly odious, &s;o they were now &s;o well known, that they were no more of any effect: So that the Army could not be recruited, but by the help of this Act. And if this is well managed, it will prove of great advantage to the Nation; &s;ince by this means, they will be delivered from many vicious and idle Per&s;ons, who are be|come a Burthen to their Country: And indeed there was of late Years &s;o great an Encrea&s;e of the Poor, that their Maintenance was become in mo&s;t Places a very heavy Load, and amounted to the full half of the publick Taxes. The Party in both Hou&s;es, that had been all along cold and backward in the War, oppo&s;ed this Act with unu&s;ual Vehemence; they pretended Zeal for the publick Liberty, and the Freedom of the Per&s;on, to which, by the Con&s;titution, they &s;aid every <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> had a Right; which they thought could not be given away, but by a legal Judgment, and for &s;ome Crime. They thought this put a Power in the hands of Ju&s;tices of Peace, which might be &s;tretched and abu&s;ed, to &s;erve bad Ends: Thus Men, that &s;eemed engaged to an Intere&s;t, that was de&s;tructive to all Liberty, could yet make u&s;e of that &s;pecious Pretence, to &s;erve their Purpo&s;e. The Act pa&s;s'd, and has been continued from Year to Year, with a very good effect: Only a vi&s;ible Remi&s;&s;ne&s;s appears in &s;ome Ju&s;tices, who are &s;ecretly influenced by Men of ill De&s;igns.</P>
<P>The chief Objection made to it in the Hou&s;e of Lords was, that <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Addre&s;s concerning the Ju&s;tices of Peace.</NOTE> the Ju&s;tices of Peace had been put in and put out, in &s;o &s;trange a manner, ever &s;ince <HI>Wright</HI> had the Great Seal, that they did not de&s;erve &s;o great a Power &s;hould be committed to them: Many Gen|tlemen, of good E&s;tates, and ancient Families, had been of late put out of the Commi&s;&s;ion, for no other vi&s;ible rea&s;on, but becau&s;e they had gone in heartily to the Revolution, and had continued zealous for the late King. This &s;eemed done on de&s;ign to mark them, and to le&s;&s;en the Intere&s;t they had in the Elections of Members of Parlia|ment: And at the &s;ame time, Men of no Worth nor E&s;tate, and known to be ill-affected to the Queen's Title, and to the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, were put in, to the great Encouragement of ill-de&s;igning Men: All was managed by &s;ecret Accu&s;ations, and Characters that were very partially given. <HI>Wright</HI> was a Zealot to the Party, and was become very exceptionable in all Re&s;pects: Money, as was &s;aid, did every thing with him; only in his Court, I never heard him charged, for any thing but great Slowne&s;s, by which the Chan|cery was become one of the heavie&s;t Grievances of the Nation. An Addre&s;s was made to the Queen, complaining of the Commi&s;&s;ions of the Peace, in which the Lords delivered their Opinion, that &s;uch as would not &s;erve, or act under the late King, were not fit to &s;erve her Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>With this the Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament was brought to a quiet Con|clu&s;ion, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The ill Temper of many, e&s;pe|cially of the Clergy.</NOTE> after much Heat and a great deal of Contention between
<PB N="380" REF="406">
the two Hou&s;es: The Queen, as &s;he thanked them for the Supplies, &s;o &s;he again recommended Union and Moderation to them. The&s;e Words, which had hitherto carried &s;o good a Sound, that all &s;ides pretended to them, were now become &s;o odious to violent Men, that even in Sermons, chiefly at <HI>Oxford,</HI> they were arraigned as import|ing &s;omewhat, that was unkind to the Church, and that favoured the Di&s;&s;enters: The Hou&s;e of Commons had, during this Se&s;&s;ion, lo&s;t much of their Reputation, not only with fair and impartial Judges, but even with tho&s;e, who were mo&s;t inclined to favour them. It is true, the Body of the Freeholders began to be unea&s;y under the Taxes, and to cry out for a Peace: And mo&s;t of the capi|tal Gentry of <HI>England,</HI> who had the mo&s;t to lo&s;e, &s;eemed to be ill|turned, and not to apprehend the Dangers we were in, if we &s;hould fall under the Power of <HI>France,</HI> and into the hands of the pretended Prince of <HI>Wales;</HI> or el&s;e they were &s;o fatally blinded, as not to &s;ee that the&s;e mu&s;t be the Con&s;equences of tho&s;e Mea&s;ures, into which they were engaged.</P>
<P>The Univer&s;ities, <HI>Oxford</HI> e&s;pecially, have been very unhappily &s;ucce&s;sful in corrupting the Principles of tho&s;e, who were &s;ent to be bred among them: So that few of them e&s;caped the Taint of it, and the Generality of the Clergy were not only ill-principled, but ill|tempered; they exclaimed again&s;t all Moderation as endangering the Church, tho' it is vi&s;ible, that the Church is in no &s;ort of Danger, from either the Numbers or the Intere&s;t that the Di&s;&s;enters have among us, which by rea&s;on of the Toleration is now &s;o quieted, that nothing can keep up any Heat in tho&s;e Matters, but the Folly and bad Humour, that the Clergy are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with, and which they infu&s;e into all tho&s;e, with whom they have Credit: But at the &s;ame time, tho' the great and vi&s;ible Danger, that hangs over us, is from Popery, which a Mi&s;carriage in the pre&s;ent War mu&s;t let in upon us, with an Inundation, not to be either re&s;i&s;ted or recovered, they &s;eem to be blind on that &s;ide, and to apprehend and fear no|thing from that Quarter.</P>
<P>The Convocation did little this Winter, they continued their for|mer ill Practices, but little Oppo&s;ition was made to them, as very little regard was had to them: They drew up a Repre&s;entation of &s;ome Abu&s;es in the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Di&s;cipline, and in the Con&s;i&s;torial Courts: But took care to mention none of tho&s;e greater ones, of which many among them&s;elves were eminently guilty; &s;uch as Plu|ralities, Non-re&s;idence, the Neglect of their Cures, and the Irregu|larities in the Lives of the Clergy, which were too vi&s;ible.</P>
<P>Soon after the Se&s;&s;ion was ended, the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> went <NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$.</NOTE> over to <HI>Holland.</HI> He had gone over for &s;ome Weeks, at the de&s;ire of the <HI>States,</HI> in <HI>January,</HI> and then there was a Scheme form'd for the Operations of the next Campaign.

of a fruitle&s;s one in the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> they would have a &s;mall Army there, to lie only on the defen&s;ive, which was to be commanded by M. <HI>Auverquerque;</HI> but that, &s;ince the <HI>Rhine</HI> was open, by the taking of <HI>Bonne,</HI> all up to the <HI>Mozelle,</HI> their main Army, that was to be commanded by the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> &s;hould act there: More was not under&s;tood to be de&s;igned, except by tho&s;e who were taken into the Confidence. Upon this, all the Preparations for the Campaign were ordered to be carried up to the <HI>Rhine;</HI> and &s;o every thing was in a readine&s;s, when he returned back to them in <HI>April:</HI> The true Secret was in few hands, and the <HI>French</HI> had no hint of it, and &s;eemed to have no Apprehen&s;ions about it.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI> was animated by the Party, to pre&s;s the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI> quitted his Place.</NOTE> Queen, to di&s;mi&s;s the Dukes of <HI>Somer&s;et</HI> and <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> from the Cabinet Council, at lea&s;t that they might be called thither no more: He moved it often, but finding no Inclination in the Queen to com|ply with his Motion, he carried the Signet to her, and told her, he could not &s;erve any longer in Councils, to which the&s;e Lords were admitted: But the Queen de&s;ired him to con&s;ider better of it.

<P>So he marched with all po&s;&s;ible Expedition from the <HI>Rhine</HI> to the <HI>Danube;</HI> which was a great Surprize to the Court of <HI>France,</HI> as <NOTE PLACE="marg">$span$ched $word$ <HI>Da|$span$.</HI></NOTE> well as to the Elector of <HI>Bavaria.</HI> The King of <HI>France</HI> &s;ent Orders to Mare&s;chal <HI>Tallard,</HI> to march in all ha&s;te, with the be&s;t Troops they had, to &s;upport the Elector; he apprehended, that the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> would endeavour to pa&s;s the <HI>Danube</HI> at <HI>Donawert,</HI> and &s;o to break into <HI>Bavaria:</HI> To prevent that, he po&s;ted about 16000 of his be&s;t Troops at <HI>Schellenberg</HI> near <HI>Donawert;</HI> which was looked on as a very &s;trong and tenable Po&s;t. The Duke of <HI>Marlbo|rough</HI> joined the Prince of <HI>Baden,</HI> with the Imperial Army, in the beginning of <HI>July;</HI> and after a long March, continued from three in the Morning, they came up to the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Troops towards the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Battle of <HI>S$span$</HI></NOTE> Evening; they were &s;o well po&s;ted, that our Men were repul&s;ed in the three fir&s;t Attacks with great Lo&s;s; at la&s;t the Enemy were beat from their Po&s;ts, which was followed with a total Rout, and we became Ma&s;ters of their Camp, their Artillery and their Baggage. Their General <HI>Arco,</HI> with many others, &s;wam over the <HI>Danube:</HI> Others got into <HI>Donawert,</HI> which they abandoned next Morning, with that precipitation, that they were not able to execute the Elec|tor's cruel Orders, which were to &s;et fire to the Town, if they &s;hould
<PB N="383" REF="409">
be forced to abandon it: Great Quantities of Scraw were laid in many places, as a Preparation for that, in ca&s;e of a Misfortune.</P>
<P>The be&s;t half of the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Forces were now entirely routed, about 5000 of them were killed: We lo&s;t as many, for the Action was very hot, and our Men were much expo&s;ed; yet they went &s;till on, and continued the Attack with &s;uch Re&s;olution, that it let the Generals &s;ee, how much they might depend on the Courage of their Soldiers. Now we were Ma&s;ters of <HI>Donawert,</HI> and thereby of a Pa&s;&s;age over the <HI>Danube,</HI> which laid all <HI>Bavaria</HI> open to our Army: Upon that the Elector, with Marc&s;chal <HI>Mar&s;in,</HI> drew the re&s;t of his Army under the Cannon of <HI>Augsbourg,</HI> where he lay &s;o well po&s;ted, that it was not po&s;&s;ible to attack him, nor to force him out of it; the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> followed him, and got between him and his Country; &s;o that it was wholly in his power. When he had him at this di&s;advantage, he entred upon a Treaty with him, and offered him what Terms he could de&s;ire, either for him&s;elf or his Brother, even to the paying him the whole Charge of the War, upon condition that he would immediately break with the <HI>French,</HI> and &s;end his Army into <HI>Italy,</HI> to join with the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> there: His Sub|jects, who were now at mercy, pre&s;&s;ed him vehemently to accept of tho&s;e Terms; he &s;eemed inclined to hearken to them, and Me&s;&s;engers went often between the two Armies: but this was done only to gain time, for he &s;ent Courier after Courier, with mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing In&s;tances to ha&s;ten the Advance of the <HI>French</HI> Army. When he &s;aw, he could gain no more time, the Matter went &s;o far, that the Articles were ordered to be made ready for &s;igning: In conclu&s;ion, he refu&s;ed to &s;ign them; and then &s;evere Orders were given for Military Execu|tion on his Country: Every thing that was within the reach of the Army, that was worth taking, was brought away; and the re&s;t was burnt and de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>The two Generals did after that re&s;olve on further Action, and &s;ince the Elector's Camp could not be forced, the Siege of <HI>Ingol&s;tad</HI> was to be carried on: It was the mo&s;t important Place he had, in which his great Magazines were laid up. The Prince of <HI>Baden</HI> went to be&s;iege it; and the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> was to cover the Siege, in conjunction with Prince <HI>Eugene,</HI> who commanded a Body of the Imperial Army, which was now drawn out of the Po&s;ts, in which they had been put, in order to hinder the March of the <HI>French:</HI> But they were not able to maintain them, again&s;t &s;o great a Force as was now coming up; the&s;e formed a great Army. Prince <HI>Eugene,</HI> having Intelligence of the quick Motions of the <HI>French,</HI> po&s;ted his Troops, that were about 18000, as advantageou&s;ly as he could: And went to concert Matters with the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> who lay at &s;ome di&s;tance: He upon that marched towards the Prince's Army with all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te, and &s;o the two Armies joined; it was now in the beginning of <HI>Augu&s;t.</HI> The Elector hearing how
<PB N="384" REF="410">
near M. <HI>Tallard</HI> was, marched with M. <HI>Mar&s;in,</HI> and joined him. Their Armies advanced very near ours, and were well po&s;ted; having the <HI>Danube</HI> on one &s;ide, and a Rivulet on the other, who&s;e Banks were high, and in &s;ome places formed a Mora&s;s before them. The two Armies were now in view one of another: The <HI>French</HI> were &s;uperior to us in Foot, by about 10000; but we had 3000 Hor&s;e more than they: The Po&s;t, of which they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, was capable of being, in a very little time, put out of all danger of future Attacks; &s;o the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> and Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> &s;aw how important it was, to lo&s;e no time, and re&s;olved to attack them the next Morning: They &s;aw the Danger of being forced otherwi&s;e to lie idle in their Camp, 'till their Forage &s;hould be con&s;umed, and their Provi&s;ions &s;pent. They had al&s;o intercepted Letters from Mare&s;chal <HI>Villeroy</HI> to the Elector, by which it appeared, that he had Orders to march into <HI>Wirtemberg,</HI> to de&s;troy that Coun|try, and to cut off the Communication with the <HI>Rhine,</HI> which mu&s;t have been fatal to us: So the nece&s;&s;ary Di&s;po&s;itions were made for the next Morning's Action. Many of the General Officers came and repre&s;ented to the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> the Difficulties of the De&s;ign; he &s;aid he &s;aw the&s;e well, but the Thing was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary: &s;o they were &s;ent to give Orders every where, which was received all over the Army with an Alacrity, that gave a happy Pre|&s;age of the Succe&s;s that followed.</P>
<P>I will not venture on a particular Relation of that great Day; I have &s;een a copious Account of it, prepared by the Duke of <HI>Marl|borough</HI>'s Orders, that will be printed &s;ome time or other: But there are &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages in it, which make him not think it fit to be pub|li&s;hed pre&s;ently. He told me, he never &s;aw more evident Charac|ters of a &s;pecial Providence, than appeared that Day; a &s;ignal one related to his own Per&s;on; a Cannon-Ball went into the Ground &s;o near him, that he was &s;ome time quite covered with the Cloud of Du&s;t and Earth that it rai&s;ed about him. I will &s;um up the Action in a few Words.</P>
<P>Our Men quickly pa&s;&s;ed the Brook, the <HI>French</HI> making no Op|po&s;ition: <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Battle of <HI>H$span$</HI></NOTE> This was a fatal Errour, and was laid wholly to <HI>Tallard</HI>'s Charge; the Action that followed, was for &s;ome time very hot, many fell on both &s;ides; ten Battalions of the <HI>French</HI> &s;tood their ground, but were in a manner mowed down in their Ranks; upon that, the Hor&s;e ran, many of them into the <HI>Danube,</HI> mo&s;t of the&s;e peri&s;hed; <HI>Tallard</HI> him&s;elf was taken Pri&s;oner. The re&s;t of his Troops were po&s;ted in the Village of <HI>Blenheim:</HI> The&s;e, &s;eeing all lo&s;t, and that &s;ome Bodies were advancing upon them, which &s;eemed to them to be thicker than indeed they were, and appre|hending that it was impo&s;&s;ible to break thro', they did not attempt it, tho' brave Men might have made their way. In&s;tead of that, when our Men came up to &s;et fire to the Village; the Earl of <HI>Orkney</HI>
<PB N="385" REF="411">
fir&s;t beating a Parley, they hearkened to it very ea&s;ily, and were all made Pri&s;oners of War: There were about 1300 Officers and 12000 common Soldiers, who laid down their Arms, and were now in our hands. Thus all <HI>Tallard</HI>'s Army was either killed in the Action, drowned in the <HI>Danube,</HI> or become Pri&s;oners by Ca|pitulation: Things went not &s;o ea&s;ily on Prince <HI>Eugene</HI>'s &s;ide, where the Elector and <HI>Mar&s;in</HI> commanded; he was repul&s;ed in three Attacks, but carried the fourth, and broke in; and &s;o he was Ma&s;ter of their Camp, Cannon, and Baggage. The Enemy retired in &s;ome order, and he pur&s;ued them as far as Men, wearied with an Action of about &s;ix Hours, in an extreme hot Day, could go; thus we gained an entire Victory. In this Action there was on our &s;ide about 12000 killed and wounded; but the <HI>French</HI> and the Elector lo&s;t about 40000 killed, wounded and taken.</P>
<P>The Elector marched with all the ha&s;te he could to <HI>Ulm,</HI> where he left &s;ome Troops, and then with a &s;mall Body got to <HI>Villeroy</HI>'s Army. Now all <HI>Bavaria</HI> was at mercy; the Electre&s;s received the Civilities due to her Sex, but &s;he was forced to &s;ubmit to &s;uch Terms, as were impo&s;ed on her: <HI>Ingol&s;tad</HI> and all the fortified Places in the Electorate, with the Magazines that were in them, were &s;oon delivered up: <HI>Augsbourg, Ulm</HI> and <HI>Memimg</HI> quickly recovered their Liberty; &s;o now our Army, having put a &s;peedy Conclu&s;ion to the War, that was got &s;o far into the Bowels of the Empire, marched quickly back to the <HI>Rhine.</HI> The Emperor made great Acknowledgements of this &s;ignal Service, which the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> had done him, and upon it offered to make him a Prince of the Empire; he very decently &s;aid, he could not accept of this, till he knew the Queen's Plea&s;ure; and upon her con&s;enting to it, he was created a Prince of the Empire, and about a Year after, <HI>Mindleheim</HI> was a&s;&s;igned him for his Principality.</P>
<P>Upon this great Succe&s;s in <HI>Germany,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> &s;ent a very pre&s;&s;ing Me&s;&s;age for a pre&s;ent Supply; the Duke of <HI>Vendome</HI> was in <HI>Piedmont,</HI> and after a long Siege had taken <HI>Verceil,</HI> and was like to make a further Progre&s;s: The few Remains of the Imperial Army, that lay in the <HI>Modoneze,</HI> gave but a &s;mall Diver&s;ion; the Grand Prior had &s;o &s;hut them up, that they lay on a feeble Defen&s;ive; Baron <HI>Leiningen</HI> was &s;ent, with another &s;mall Army into the <HI>Bre&s;cian;</HI> but he was &s;o ill &s;upplied, that he could do nothing, but eat up the Country; and the <HI>Venetians</HI> were &s;o feeble and &s;o fearful, that they &s;uffered their Country to be eat up by both &s;ides, without declaring for or again&s;t either. The Prince of <HI>Baden</HI> in&s;i&s;ted on under|taking the Siege of <HI>Landau,</HI> as nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure the Circles, <HI>Suabia</HI> in particular, from the Excur&s;ions of that Garri&s;on: This was popular in <HI>Germany,</HI> and tho' the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> did not ap|prove it, he did not oppo&s;e it, with all the Authority that his great Suc|ce&s;s gave him: So the Prince of <HI>Baden</HI> undertook it, while the Duke
<PB N="386" REF="412">
with his Army cover'd the Siege. This was univer&s;ally blamed, for while <HI>France</HI> was in the Con&s;ternation, which the late great Lo&s;s brought them under, a more vigorous Proceeding was like to have greater Effects; be&s;ides that the Imperial Army was ill provided, the great Charge of a Siege was above their Strength: The Prince of <HI>Baden</HI> &s;uffered much in his Reputation for this Undertaking; it was that, which the <HI>French</HI> wi&s;hed for, and &s;o it was &s;u&s;pected, that &s;ome &s;ecret Practice had prevailed on that Prince to propo&s;e it. It is certain, that he was jealous of the Glory the Duke had got, in which he had no &s;hare; and it was believed, that if he had not gone to be|&s;iege <HI>Ingol&s;tat,</HI> the Battle had never been fought: He was indeed &s;o fierce a Bigot in his Religion, that he could not bear the Succe&s;&s;es of tho&s;e, he called Hereticks, and the Exaltation which he thought Here&s;y might have upon it.</P>
<P>While the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> lay covering the Siege, <HI>Villeroy</HI> with his Army came and looked on him; but as our Soldiers were exalted with their Succe&s;s, &s;o the <HI>French</HI> were too much di&s;pirited with their Lo&s;&s;es, to make any Attack, or to put any thing to hazard, in order to rai&s;e the Siege: They retired back, and went into Quar|ters, and tru&s;ted to the bad State of the Imperial Army, who were ill provided and ill &s;upplied; the Garri&s;on made as vigorous a De|fence, and drew out the Siege to as great a Length, as could be ex|pected: The Prince of <HI>Baden</HI> had neither Engineers nor Ammuni|tion, and wanted Money to provide them; &s;o that if the Duke had not &s;upplied him, he mu&s;t have been forced to give it over. The King of the <HI>Romans</HI> came again, to have the honour of taking the Place; his Behaviour there did not &s;erve to rai&s;e his Character; he was not often in the Places of Danger, and was content to look on at a great and &s;afe Di&s;tance; he was always be&s;et with Prie&s;ts, and &s;uch a face of Super&s;tition and Bigotry appeared about him, that it very much damped the Hopes, that were given of him.</P>
<P>When it appeared, that there was no need of an Army to cover <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of <HI>Marlbo|rough</HI> ad|vanced to <HI>Triers,</HI></NOTE> the Siege, and that the Place could not hold out many Days: The Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> re&s;olved to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of <HI>Triers,</HI> as a good Winter Quarter, that brought him near the Confines of <HI>France;</HI> from whence he might open the Campaign next Year, with great Advantage: And he reckoned that the taking of <HI>Traerback,</HI> even in that advanced Sea&s;on, would be &s;oon done: And then the Com|munication with <HI>Holland,</HI> by Water, was all clear: So that during the Winter, every thing that was nece&s;&s;ary could be brought up thi|ther from <HI>Holland</HI> &s;afe and cheap. This he executed with that Di|ligence, that the <HI>French</HI> abandoned every Place as he advanced, with &s;uch precipitation, that they had not time given them, to burn the Places they for&s;ook, according to the barbarous Method, which they had long practi&s;ed. The Duke got to <HI>Triers,</HI> and that being a large Place, he po&s;ted a great Part of his Army in and about it, and left
<PB N="387" REF="413">
a &s;ufficient Force with the Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e</HI> for the taking of <HI>Traer|back,</HI> which held out &s;ome Weeks, but capitulated at la&s;t. <HI>Landau</HI> was not taken before the middle of <HI>November.</HI></P>
<P>Thus ended this glorious Campaign; in which <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Hol|land</HI> gained a very unu&s;ual Glory: for as they had never &s;ent their Armies &s;o far by Land, &s;o their triumphant Return helped not a little to animate and unite their Coun&s;els. Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> had a ju&s;t Share, in the Honour of this great Expedition, which he had chiefly promoted by his Coun&s;els, and did &s;o nobly &s;upport by his Conduct. The Prince of <HI>Baden</HI> had no &s;hare in the publick Joy: His Conduct was as bad as could be, and the Fret he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with, upon the Glory that the other Generals carried from him, threw him, as was believed, into a Langui&s;hing, of which he never quite recovered, and of which he died two Years after.</P>
<P>At the Conclu&s;ion of the Campaign, the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> went to <HI>Berlin,</HI> where he concerted the Mea&s;ures for the next Cam|paign, and agreed with the King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> for 8000 of his Troops, which were to be &s;ent to <HI>Italy</HI> upon the Queen's Pay: He had &s;et|tled Matters with the Emperor's Mini&s;ters, &s;o that they undertook to &s;end Prince <HI>Eugene,</HI> with an Army of 20000 Men, who &s;hould begin their March into <HI>Italy,</HI> as &s;oon as it was po&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s the Mountains: Of the&s;e the Queen and the <HI>States</HI> were to pay 16000. He returned, by the Court of <HI>Hanover,</HI> where he was treated with all the Honour, that the Succe&s;s of the Campaign well de&s;erved: He met with the &s;ame Reception in <HI>Holland,</HI> and was as much con&s;i|dered and &s;ubmitted to, as if he had been their <HI>Stadtholder:</HI> The Credit he was in among them was very happy to them, and was indeed nece&s;&s;ary at that time, for keeping down their Factions and Animo&s;ities, which were ri&s;ing in every Province, and in mo&s;t of their Towns. Only <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> as it was the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible of the com|mon Danger, &s;o it was not only quiet within it&s;elf, but it contributed not a little to keep all the re&s;t &s;o, which was chiefly maintained by the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI>'s prudent Management. <HI>England</HI> was full of Joy, and Addre&s;&s;es of Congratulation were &s;ent up from all Parts of the Nation; but it was very vi&s;ible that, in many Places, the Tories went into the&s;e very coldly, and perhaps that made the Whigs the more zealous and affectionate.</P>
<P>I now turn to the other Element, where our Affairs were car|ried <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs at Sea.</NOTE> on more doubtfully. <HI>Rook</HI> &s;ailed into the <HI>Straits</HI> where he reckoned he was &s;trong enough for the <HI>Toulon</HI> Squadron, which was then abroad in the <HI>Mediterranean.</HI> Soon after that, a &s;trong Squa|dron from <HI>Bre&s;t</HI> pa&s;&s;ed by <HI>Lisbon</HI> into the <HI>Straits. Methuen,</HI> our Amba&s;&s;ador there, apprehending, that if the&s;e two Squadrons &s;hould join to attack <HI>Rook,</HI> it would not be po&s;&s;ible for him to fight again&s;t &s;o great a Force, &s;ent a Man-of-War, that <HI>Rook</HI> had left at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> with &s;ome particular Orders, which made him very unwilling to
<PB N="388" REF="414">
carry the Me&s;&s;age, but <HI>Methuen</HI> promi&s;ed to &s;ave him harmle&s;s. He upon that &s;ailed thro' the <HI>French</HI> Fleet, and brought this important Adverti&s;ement to <HI>Rook;</HI> who told him, that on this occa&s;ion he would pa&s;s by his not ob&s;erving his Orders, but that for the future, he would find the &s;afe&s;t Cour&s;e was to obey Orders. Upon this, <HI>Rook</HI> &s;tood out of the way of the <HI>French,</HI> towards the Mouth of the <HI>Straits,</HI> and there he met <HI>Shovel,</HI> with a Squadron of our be&s;t Ships; &s;o being thus reinforced, he failed up the <HI>Straits,</HI> being now in a Condition, if need were, to engage the <HI>French.</HI> He came before <HI>Barcelona,</HI> where the Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e Darm&s;tat</HI> a&s;&s;ured him, there was a &s;trong Party ready to declare for King <HI>Charles,</HI> as it was certain, that there was a great Di&s;po&s;ition in many to it. But <HI>Rook</HI> would not &s;tay above three Days before it: So that the Motions within the Town, and the Di&s;coveries that many made of their In|clinations, had almo&s;t proved fatal to them: He an&s;wered, when pre&s;&s;ed to &s;tay a few Days more, that his Orders were po&s;itive: He mu&s;t make towards <HI>Nice:</HI> which it was believed the <HI>French</HI> intended to be&s;iege.</P>
<P>But as he was &s;ailing that way, he had Advice, that the <HI>French</HI> had made no Advances in that De&s;ign: So he turned his Cour&s;e We&s;tward, and came in &s;ight of the <HI>French</HI> Fleet, &s;ailing from <HI>Bre&s;t</HI> to <HI>Toulon:</HI> The Advantage he had was &s;o vi&s;ible, that it was expected he would have made towards them; he did it not: What Orders he had was not known, for the Matter never came under Examination: They got to <HI>Toulon,</HI> and he &s;teered another way. The whole <HI>French</HI> Fleet was then together in that Harbour, for tho' the <HI>Toulon</HI> Squadron had been out before, it was then in Port.</P>
<P>A very happy Accident had pre&s;erved a rich Fleet of Merchant Ships from <HI>Scanderoon,</HI> under the Convoy of three or four Frigates, from falling into their hands: The <HI>French</HI> Fleet lay in their way in the Bay of <HI>Tunis,</HI> and nothing could have &s;aved them from being taken, but that which happened in the critical Minute, in which they needed it: A thick Fog covered them all the while, that they were &s;ailing by that Bay, &s;o that they had no Apprehen&s;ion of the Danger they were in, till they had pa&s;s'd it. I know it is not po&s;|&s;ible to determine, when &s;uch Accidents ri&s;e from a Chain of &s;econd Cau&s;es in the Cour&s;e of Nature, and when they are directed by a &s;pecial Providence: But my Mind has always carried me &s;o &s;trongly to acknowledge the latter, that I love to &s;et the&s;e Reflections in the way of others, that they may con&s;ider them with the &s;ame &s;erious Attention, that I feel in my&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Rook,</HI> as he &s;ailed back, fell in upon <HI>Gibraltar;</HI> where he &s;pent <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gibraltar</HI> was taken.</NOTE> much Powder, bombarding it to very little purpo&s;e, that he might &s;eem to attempt &s;omewhat; though there was no rea&s;on to hope that he could &s;ucceed: Some bold Men ventured to go a-&s;hore, in a Place where it was not thought po&s;&s;ible to climb up the Rocks;
<PB N="389" REF="415">
yet they &s;ucceeded in it: When they got up, they &s;aw all the Wo|men of the Town were come out, according to their Super&s;tition, to a Chapel there, to implore the Virgin's Protection; they &s;eized on them, and that contributed not a little to di&s;po&s;e tho&s;e in the Town to &s;urrender; they had leave to &s;tay or go as they plea&s;ed; and in ca&s;e they &s;taid, they were a&s;&s;ured of Protection in their Religion, and in every thing el&s;e; for the Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e,</HI> who was to be their Governour, was a Papi&s;t: But they all went away, with the &s;mall Garri&s;on that had defended the Place.

<P>It has been much que&s;tioned, by Men who under&s;tand the&s;e Mat|ters well, whether our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing our&s;elves of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> and our maintaining our&s;elves in it &s;o long, was to our Advantage or not; it has certainly put us to a great Charge, and we have lo&s;t many Men in it; but it &s;eems the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who &s;hould know the Im|portance of the Place be&s;t, think it &s;o valuable, that they have been at a much greater Charge, and have lo&s;t many more Men, while they have endeavoured to recover it, than the taking or keeping it has co&s;t us: And it is certain that in War, what&s;oever Lo&s;s on one &s;ide occa&s;ions a greater Lo&s;s of Men or of Trea&s;ure to the other, mu&s;t be reckoned a Lo&s;s only to the &s;ide that &s;uffers mo&s;t.</P>
<P>Our Expedition in <HI>Portugal,</HI> and our Armies there, which co&s;t <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Affairs of <HI>Portugal.</HI></NOTE> us &s;o dear, and from which we expected &s;o much, had not hitherto had any great Effects: The King of <HI>Portugal</HI> expre&s;&s;ed the be&s;t In|tentions po&s;&s;ible; but he was much governed by his Mini&s;ters, who were all in the <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;ts; they had a great Army, but they had made no Preparations for taking the Field; nor could they bring their Troops together, for want of Provi&s;ions and Carriages; the Forms of their Government made them very &s;low, and not ea&s;ily acce&s;&s;ible: They were too proud to confe&s;s that they wanted any thing, when they had nothing; and too lazy to be&s;tir them&s;elves, to execute what was in their power to do; and the King's ill Health furni&s;hed them with an Excu&s;e, for every thing that was defec|tive, and out of order. The Prie&s;ts both in <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portugal</HI> were &s;o univer&s;ally in the <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;t, that even the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> that had been formerly &s;o much in their favour, was now in di&s;grace with them: Their Alliance with Hereticks, and their bringing over an Army of them, to maintain their Preten&s;ions, had made all their former Services be forgotten: The governing Body at <HI>Rome</HI> did certainly engage all their Zealots every where to &s;upport that Intere&s;t, which is now &s;o &s;et on the De&s;truction of Here&s;y. King <HI>Philip</HI> advanced towards the Frontiers of <HI>Portugal,</HI>

his Army being commanded by the Duke of <HI>Berwick,</HI> who began to &s;hine there, tho' he had pa&s;s'd el&s;ewhere for a Man of no very great Character. They had &s;everal Advantages of the <HI>Portugueze;</HI> &s;ome of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Battalions, which were &s;o po&s;ted, that they could not be relieved, and in Places that were not tenable, fell into the Enemies hands, and were made Pri&s;oners of War. Some of the General Officers, who came over, &s;aid to me, that if the Duke of <HI>Berwick</HI> had followed his Advantages, nothing could have hindered his coming to <HI>Lisbon.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Schomberg</HI> was a better Officer in the Field, than in the Cabinet; he did not enough know how to prepare for a Campaign; he was both too unactive and too haughty; &s;o it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end another to command: The Earl of <HI>Galway</HI> was judged the fitte&s;t Per&s;on for that Service; he undertook it, more in &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Queen's Commands, than out of any great Pro&s;pect or Hopes of Succe&s;s; things went on very heavily there; the Di&s;traction that the taking <HI>Gibraltar</HI> put the <HI>Spa|niards</HI> in, as it occa&s;ioned a Diver&s;ion of &s;ome of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Forces, that lay on their Frontier, &s;o it furni&s;hed them with Advantages, which they took no care to improve.</P>
<P><HI>Rook,</HI> after he had &s;upplied <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> failed again into the <HI>Me|diterranean:</HI> And there he met the Count of <HI>Thoulou&s;e,</HI> with the <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Fight at Sea.</NOTE> whole <HI>French</HI> Fleet: They were &s;uperiour to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in number, and had many Gallies with them, that were of great u&s;e. <HI>Rook</HI> called a Council of War, in which it was re&s;olved to engage them; there was not due Care taken, to furni&s;h all the Ships with a &s;ufficient quantity of Powder, for &s;ome had wa&s;ted a great part of their Stock of Ammunition before <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> yet they had generally Twenty|five Rounds, and it had &s;eldom happened, that &s;o much Powder was &s;pent in an Action at Sea. On the 12th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> ju&s;t ten Days after the Battle of <HI>Hock&s;ted,</HI> the two Fleets engaged: <HI>Shovel</HI> ad|vanced with his Squadron to a clo&s;e Fight, for it was the Maxim of our Seamen to fight as near as they could; he had the Advantage, and the Squadron before him gave way: <HI>Rook</HI> fought at a greater di&s;tance; many Broad-&s;ides pa&s;&s;ed, and the Engagement continued till Night parted them; &s;ome Ships, that had &s;pent all their Ammu|nition, were forced on that account to go out of the Line, and if the <HI>French</HI> had come to a new Engagement next Day, it might have been fatal, &s;ince many of our Ships were without Powder, whil&s;t others had enough and to &s;pare.</P>
<P>In this long and hot Action, there was no Ship of either &s;ide, that was either taken, &s;unk or burnt; we made a &s;hew, the next Day, of preparing for a &s;econd Engagement; but the Enemy bore off, to the great Joy of our Fleet; the <HI>French</HI> &s;uffered much in this Ac|tion; and went into <HI>Toulon</HI> &s;o di&s;abled, that they could not be put in a condition to go to Sea again in many Months. They left the Sea, as the Field of Battel, to us; &s;o the Honour of the Action re|mained

with us; tho' the Nation was not much lifted up, with the News of a drawn Battle at Sea with the <HI>French.</HI> We were long without a certain Account of this Action; but the Mode&s;ty, in which the King of <HI>France</HI> wrote of it, to the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Paris,</HI> put us out of all fears; for whereas their Stile was very boa&s;ting of their Succe&s;&s;es, in this it was only &s;aid, that the Action was to his Advantage; from that cold Expre&s;&s;ion we concluded the Victory was on our &s;ide.</P>
<P>When the full Account was &s;ent home from our Fleet, the Par|tialities on both &s;ides appeared very &s;ignally; the Tories magnified this, as a great Victory, and in their Addre&s;&s;es of Congratulation to the Queen, they joined this with that which the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> had gained at <HI>Hock&s;ted.</HI> I under&s;tand nothing of Sea-Matters; and therefore cannot make a Judgment in the Point: I have heard Men, skilled in tho&s;e Affairs, differ much in their Sentiments of <HI>Rook</HI>'s Conduct in that Action; &s;ome not only ju&s;tifying but extol|ling it, as much as others condemn'd it. It was certainly ridiculous, to &s;et forth the Glory of &s;o di&s;putable an Engagement, in the &s;ame Words, with the Succe&s;&s;es we had by Land: The Fleet &s;oon after &s;ailed home for <HI>England, Leak</HI> being left with a Squadron at <HI>Lisbon.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> drew all the Forces, they had in <HI>Andalou&s;ia</HI> and <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Siege of <HI>Gibraltar.</HI></NOTE> <HI>E&s;tremadura</HI> together, to retake <HI>Gibraltar;</HI> that Army was command|ed by the Duke of <HI>Villadarias;</HI> he had with him &s;ome <HI>French</HI> Troops, with &s;ome Engineers of that Nation, who were chiefly relied on, and were &s;ent from <HI>France</HI> to carry on the Siege. This gave &s;ome Di&s;|gu&s;t to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who were &s;o fooli&s;h in their Pride, that tho' they could do nothing for them&s;elves, and indeed knew not how to &s;et about it, yet could not bear to be taught by others, or to &s;ee them&s;elves out-done by them. The Siege was continued for above four Months, during which time the Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e</HI> had many oc|ca&s;ions given him to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf very eminently, both as to his Courage, Conduct, and indefatigable Application. Convoys came frequently from <HI>Lisbon,</HI> with Supplies of Men and Provi&s;ions; which the <HI>French</HI> were not able to hinder, or to intercept. <HI>Pointy</HI> at la&s;t came, with a Squadron of twenty <HI>French</HI> Ships, and lay long in the Bay, trying what could be done by Sea; while the Place was pre&s;&s;ed by Land; upon that, a much &s;tronger Squadron was &s;ent from <HI>Lisbon,</HI> with a great Body of Men, and Stores of all &s;orts, to relieve the Place and to rai&s;e the Siege; and the Court of <HI>France,</HI> not being &s;atisfied with the Conduct of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> General, &s;ent Mare&s;chal <HI>Te&s;&s;e</HI> to carry on the Siege with greater Expedition.

occa&s;ioned by Di&s;orders in his Youth; he had not been treated skil|fully, &s;o he was often relap&s;ing, and was not in a condition to ap|ply him&s;elf much to Bu&s;ine&s;s: For &s;ome time, our Queen Dowager was &s;et at the Head of their Councils; her Admini&s;tration was much commended, and &s;he was very careful of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and all their Concerns.</P>
<P>In <HI>Italy</HI> the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> had a melancholy Campaign, lo&s;ing <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in <HI>Italy.</HI></NOTE> Place after Place; but he &s;upported his Affairs with great Conduct; and &s;hewed a Firmne&s;s in his Misfortunes, beyond what could have been imagined: <HI>Verceil</HI> and <HI>Yvrea</HI> gave the Duke of <HI>Vendome</HI> the trouble of a tedious Siege; they &s;tood their ground as long as po&s;&s;ible; the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI>'s Army was not &s;trong enough to rai&s;e the&s;e Sieges, &s;o both Places fell in conclu&s;ion.

The <HI>French</HI> Army &s;uffered much, by conti|nuing the Siege all the Winter, and they were at a va&s;t Charge in carrying it on; the Bridge of Communication was, after many un|&s;ucce&s;sful Attempts, at la&s;t cut off; and the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> being thus &s;eparated from the Place, retired to <HI>Chivaz,</HI> and left them to de|&s;end them&s;elves, as long as they could, which they did beyond what could in rea&s;on have been expected. The Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> com|plained much of the Emperor's failing to make good his Promi&s;es; but in a Di&s;cour&s;e upon that Subject, with the Queen's Envoy, he &s;aid, tho' he was abandoned by his Allies, he would not abandon him&s;elf.</P>

<P>The Di&s;orders in <HI>Hungary</HI> had a deeper Root, and a greater <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of <HI>Hungary.</HI></NOTE> Strength; it was hoped, that the Ruin of the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> would have quite di&s;heartened them, and have di&s;po&s;ed them to accept of rea&s;onable Terms; if the Emperor could have been prevailed on to offer them frankly, and immediately upon their fir&s;t Con&s;ternation, after the Conque&s;t of <HI>Bavaria.</HI> There were great Errors in the Government of that Kingdom; by a long Cour&s;e of Oppre&s;&s;ion and Inju&s;tice, the <HI>Hungarians</HI> were grown &s;avage and intractable; they &s;aw they were both hated and de|&s;pi&s;ed by the <HI>Germans;</HI> the Court of <HI>Vienna</HI> &s;eemed to con&s;ider them, as &s;o many Enemies, who were to be depre&s;&s;ed, in order to their being extirpated; upon any pretence of Plots, their Per|&s;ons were &s;eized on, and their E&s;tates confi&s;cated: The Je&s;uits were believed to have a great &s;hare, in all tho&s;e Contrivances and Pro&s;ecutions; and it was &s;aid, that they purcha&s;ed the confi&s;cated E&s;tates upon very ea&s;y Terms; the Nobility of <HI>Hungary</HI> &s;eemed irreconcileable to the Court of <HI>Vienna:</HI> On the other hand, tho&s;e of that Court, who had the&s;e Confi&s;cations a&s;&s;igned them, and knew that the re&s;toring the&s;e would certainly be in&s;i&s;ted on as a nece&s;&s;ary Article, in any Treaty that might follow, did all they could to ob&s;truct &s;uch a Treaty. It was vi&s;ible that <HI>Ragotski,</HI> who was at their head, aimed at the Principality of <HI>Tran&s;ylvania:</HI> And it was natural for the <HI>Hungarians</HI> to look on his arriving at that Dignity, by which he could protect and a&s;&s;i&s;t them, as the be&s;t Security they could have. On the other hand, the Court of <HI>Vienna,</HI> being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that Principality, would not ea&s;ily part with it. In the mid&s;t of all this Fermentation, a Revolu|tion happened in the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Empire: A new Sultan was &s;et up. So all things were at a &s;tand, till it might be known, what was to be expected from him. They were &s;oon delivered from this Anxiety; for he &s;ent a <HI>Chiaus</HI> to the Court of <HI>Vienna,</HI> to a&s;&s;ure them, that he was re&s;olved to maintain the Peace in all points; and that he would give no A&s;&s;i&s;tance to the Malecontents. The Court of <HI>Vienna</HI> being freed from tho&s;e Apprehen&s;ions, re&s;olved to carry on the War in <HI>Hungary,</HI> as vigorou&s;ly as they could: This was imputed to a &s;ecret Practice from <HI>France,</HI> on &s;ome of that Court, and there were &s;o many there, concerned in the Con|fi&s;cations, that every Propo&s;ition that way was powerfully &s;upported: thus <HI>Italy</HI> was neglected, and the Siege of <HI>Landau</HI> was ill &s;up|ported; their chief Strength being imployed in <HI>Hungary.</HI> Yet when the Mini&s;ters of the Allies pre&s;&s;ed the Opening a Treaty with the Malecontents, the Emperor &s;eemed willing to refer the Arbi|tration of that Matter to his Allies: But tho' it was fit to &s;peak in
<PB N="394" REF="420">
that Stile, yet no &s;uch thing was de&s;igned. A Treaty was opened, but when it was known that <HI>Zeiher</HI> had the chief Management of it, there was no rea&s;on to expect any good effect of it: He was born a Prote&s;tant, a Subject of the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> and was oft em|ployed by the Elector <HI>Charles Lewis,</HI> to negotiate Affairs at the Court of <HI>Vienna;</HI> he, &s;eeing a Pro&s;pect of ri&s;ing in that Court, changed his Religion, and became a Creature of the Je&s;uits; and adhered &s;teadily to all their Intere&s;ts. He managed that &s;ecret Practice with the <HI>French</HI> in the Treaty of <HI>Ry&s;wick,</HI> by which the Prote&s;tants of the <HI>Palatinate</HI> &s;uffered &s;o con&s;iderable a Prejudice.

<P>So was its neighbouring Kingdom of <HI>Poland:</HI> It was hoped, that <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Affairs of <HI>Poland.</HI></NOTE> the Talk of a new Election was only a loud Threatning, to force a Peace the &s;ooner; but it proved otherwi&s;e: A Diet was brought together of tho&s;e, who were irreconcileable to King <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> and after many Delays, <HI>Stani&s;laus,</HI> one of the <HI>Palatines,</HI> was cho&s;en and proclaimed their King; and he was pre&s;ently owned by the King of <HI>Sweden.</HI> The Cardinal &s;eemed at fir&s;t unwilling to agree to this, but he &s;uffered him&s;elf to be forced to it; this was be|lieved to be only an Artifice of his, to excu&s;e him&s;elf to the Court of <HI>France,</HI> who&s;e Pen&s;ioner he was, and to whom he had en|gaged to carry the Election for the Prince of <HI>Conti.</HI> The War went on this Year, with various Succe&s;s on both &s;ides; King <HI>Au|gu&s;tus</HI> made a quick March to <HI>War&s;aw,</HI> where he &s;urprized &s;ome of <HI>Stani&s;lau</HI>'s Party, he him&s;elf e&s;caping narrowly; but the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> followed &s;o clo&s;e, that not being able to fight him, he was forced to retreat into <HI>Saxony,</HI> where he continued for &s;ome Months: There he ruined his own Dominions, by the great Pre|parations he made, to return with a mighty Force; the Delay of that made many for&s;ake his Party; for it was given out, that he would return no more, and that he was weary of the War, and he had good rea&s;on &s;o to be. <HI>Poland,</HI> in the mean while, was in a mo&s;t mi&s;erable Condition; the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted his Army in it, and his Temper grew daily more fierce and <HI>Gothick;</HI> he was re&s;olved to make no Peace, till <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI>

was driven out: in the mean while, his own Country &s;uf|fered much; <HI>Livonia</HI> was de&s;troyed by the <HI>Mu&s;covites;</HI> they had taken <HI>Narva,</HI> and made &s;ome progre&s;&s;es into <HI>Sweden.</HI> The Pope e&s;pou&s;ed the Intere&s;ts of King <HI>Augu&s;tus;</HI> for to &s;upport a new Convert of &s;uch Importance, was thought a Point worthy the Zeal of that See; &s;o he cited the Cardinal to appear at <HI>Rome,</HI> and to give an Account of the &s;hare he had in all that War.</P>
<P>The Pope was now wholly in the <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;t, and main|tained <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pope wholly in the <HI>French</HI> In|tere&s;t.</NOTE> the Character, they pretend to, of a common Father, with &s;o much Partiality, that the Emperor him&s;elf, how tame and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive &s;oever to all the Impo&s;itions of that See, yet could not bear it: But made loud Complaints of it. The Pope had threatned, that he would thunder out Excommunications again&s;t all tho&s;e Troops, that &s;hould continue in his Dominions: the Emperor was &s;o implicit in his Faith, and &s;o ready in his Obedience, that he ordered his Troops to retire out of the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical State; but all the Effect that this had, was to leave that State entirely in the hands of the <HI>French,</HI> again&s;t whom the Pope did not think fit to fulminate; yet the Pope &s;till pretended that he would maintain a Neutrality, and both the <HI>Venetians</HI> and the Great Duke adhered to him in that Re&s;olution, and continued neutral during the War.</P>
<P>Having now given a View of the State of Affairs abroad; I <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Affairs of <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> return back to pro&s;ecute the Relation of tho&s;e at home, and be|gin with <HI>Scotland.</HI> A Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament was held there this Summer: The Duke of <HI>Queensbury</HI>'s Management of the Plot was &s;o liable to Exception, that it was not thought fit to imploy him, and it &s;eems he had likewi&s;e brought him&s;elf under the Queen's Di&s;plea&s;ure; for it was propo&s;ed by &s;ome of his Friends in the Hou&s;e of Lords, to de&s;ire the Queen to communicate to them a Letter, which he had wrote to her of &s;uch a Date: This looked like an Examination of the Queen her&s;elf, to whom it ought to have been left, to &s;end what Letters &s;he thought fit to the Hou&s;e, and they ought not to call for any one in particular. The Matter of that Letter made him liable to a very &s;evere Cen|&s;ure in <HI>Scotland:</HI> For in plain Words he charged the Majority of the Parliament, as determined in their Proceedings, by an In|fluence from <HI>St. Germains:</HI> This expo&s;ed him in <HI>Scotland</HI> to the Fury of a Parliament; for how true &s;oever this might be, by the Laws of that Kingdom, &s;uch a Repre&s;entation of a Parliament to the Queen, e&s;pecially in Matters which could not be proved, was <HI>Lea&s;ing-making,</HI> and was capital.</P>
<P>The chief De&s;ign of the Court in this Se&s;&s;ion, was to get the Succe&s;&s;ion of the Crown to be declared, and a Supply to be given for the Army, which was run into a great Arrear. In the Debates of the former Se&s;&s;ion, tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed every thing,

more particularly the declaring the Succe&s;&s;ion, had in&s;i&s;ted chiefly on Motions to bring their own Con&s;titution to &s;uch a Set|tlement, that they might &s;uffer no Prejudice, by their King's living in <HI>England.</HI> Mr. <HI>John&s;toun</HI> was now taken in by the Mi|ni&s;ters into a new Management: It was propo&s;ed by him, in concert with the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Tweedale,</HI> and &s;ome others in <HI>Scot|land,</HI> that the Queen &s;hould empower her Commi&s;&s;ioner to con|&s;ent to a Revival of the whole Settlement, made by King <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t, in the Year 1641.</P>
<P>By that, the King named a Privy Council and his Mini&s;ters of State in Parliament, who had a power to accept of, or to ex|cept to the Nomination, without being bound to give the Rea&s;on for excepting to it: In the Intervals of Parliament, the King was to give all Imployments, with the Con&s;ent of the Privy Council: This was the main Point of that Settlement, which was looked on by the wi&s;e&s;t Men of that time, as a full Security to all their Laws and Liberties: It did indeed dive&s;t the Crown of a great part of the Prerogative; and it brought the Parliament into &s;ome Equality with the Crown.</P>
<P>The Queen, upon the Repre&s;entation made to her by her Mini&s;ters, offered this as a Limitation on the Succe&s;&s;or, in ca&s;e they would &s;ettle the Succe&s;&s;ion, as <HI>England</HI> had done; and for doing this, the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Tweedale</HI> was named her Commi&s;&s;io|ner. The Queen did al&s;o &s;ignify her Plea&s;ure very po&s;itively to all who were imployed by her, that &s;he expected they &s;hould concur in &s;ettling the Succe&s;&s;ion, as they de&s;ired the Continuance of her Favour. Both the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> and the Lord <HI>Godolphin</HI> expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves very fully and po&s;itively to the &s;ame purpo&s;e; yet it was dextrou&s;ly &s;urmized, and indu&s;|triou&s;ly &s;et about by the <HI>Jacobites,</HI> and too ea&s;ily believed by jealous and cautious People, that the Court was not &s;incere in this Matter; and that at be&s;t they were indifferent as to the Suc|ce&s;s. Some went further, and &s;aid, that tho&s;e who were in a particular Confidence at Court, did &s;ecretly oppo&s;e it, and en|tred into a Management on de&s;ign to ob&s;truct it: I could never &s;ee any good ground for this Sugge&s;tion; yet there was Matter enough for Jealou&s;y to work on, and this was carefully improved by the <HI>Jacobites,</HI> in order to defeat the De&s;ign. Mr. <HI>John|&s;toun</HI> was made Lord Regi&s;ter, and was &s;ent down to promote the De&s;ign; the <HI>Jacobites</HI> were put in hopes, in ca&s;e of a Rupture, to have a con&s;iderable Force &s;ent to &s;upport them from <HI>Dunkirk.</HI></P>
<P>A Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament being opened, and the Speeches made, and the Queen's Letter read, all which tended to the &s;ettling the Succe&s;&s;ion, that was the fir&s;t Debate: A great Party was now
<PB N="397" REF="423">
wrought on, when they under&s;tood the Security, that was to be offered to them: For the wi&s;e&s;t Patriots in that Kingdom had al|ways magnified that Con&s;titution, as the be&s;t contrived Scheme that could be de&s;ired: So they went in with great Zeal, to the accepting of it. But tho&s;e who, in the former Se&s;&s;ion, had re|jected all the Motions of treating with <HI>England</HI> with &s;ome Scorn, and had made this their con&s;tant Topick, that they mu&s;t in the fir&s;t place &s;ecure their own Con&s;titution at home, and then they might tru&s;t the re&s;t to Time, and to &s;uch Accidents, as Time might bring forth; now when they &s;aw that every thing, that could be de&s;ired, was offered with relation to their own Govern|ment; they (being re&s;olved to oppo&s;e any Declaration of the Suc|ce&s;&s;ion, what Terms &s;oever might be granted to obtain it) turned the Argument wholly another way; to &s;hew the nece&s;&s;ity of a previous Treaty with <HI>England.</HI> They were upon that told, that the Queen was ready to grant them every thing, that was rea&s;on|able, with relation to their own Con&s;titution, yet without the Concurrence of the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> &s;he could grant no|thing, in which <HI>England</HI> was concerned; for they were for de|manding a &s;hare of the Plantation-Trade, and that their Ships might be comprehended within the Act of Navigation.</P>
<P>After a long Debate, the main Que&s;tion was put, whether <NOTE PLACE="marg">Debates about the Succe&s;&s;ion.</NOTE> they &s;hould then enter upon the Con&s;ideration of the Limitations of the Government, in order to the fixing the Succe&s;&s;ion of the Crown, or if that &s;hould be po&s;tponed till they had obtained &s;uch a Security, by a Treaty with <HI>England,</HI> as they &s;hould judge ne|ce&s;&s;ary. It was carried by a Majority of forty, to begin with a Treaty with <HI>England:</HI> Of the&s;e, about thirty were in immediate Dependence on the Court, and were determined according to the Directions given them. So, notwith&s;tanding a long and idle Speech of the Earl of <HI>Cromarty</HI>'s, which was printed, running in|to a Di&s;tinction among Divines, between the Revealed and Secret Will of God, &s;hewing, that no &s;uch Di&s;tinction could be applied to the Queen; She had but one Will, and that was Revcaled; yet it was &s;till &s;u&s;pected, that at lea&s;t her Mini&s;ters had a Secret Will in the Ca&s;e. They went no further in this Vote for a Treaty <NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;ettling it put off for that Se&s;&s;ion.</NOTE> with <HI>England;</HI> for they could not agree among them&s;elves, who &s;hould be the Commi&s;&s;ioners, and tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed the de|claring the Succe&s;&s;ion, were concerned for no more, when that Que&s;tion was once &s;et a&s;ide: So it was po&s;tponed, as a Matter about which they took no further care.</P>
<P>They offered to the Court &s;ix Months <HI>Ce&s;&s;e,</HI> for the Pay of <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Money-Bill with a Tack to it.</NOTE> the Army; but they tacked to this a great part of a Bill which pa&s;&s;ed the former Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, but was refu&s;ed by the
<PB N="398" REF="424">
Throne: By that it was provided, that if the Queen &s;hould die without I&s;&s;ue, a Parliament &s;hould pre&s;ently meet, and they were to declare the Succe&s;&s;or to the Crown, who &s;hould not be the &s;ame Per&s;on, that was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> unle&s;s before that time there &s;hould be a Settlement made in Parliament, of the Rights and Liberties of the Nation, independent on <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Councils. By another Clau&s;e in the Act, it was made lawful to arm the Subjects, and to train them and put them, in a Po&s;ture of Defence. This was chiefly pre&s;&s;ed, in behalf of the be&s;t-affected in the Kingdom, who were not armed; for the Highlanders, who were the wor&s;t-affected, were well armed; &s;o to ballance that, it was moved, that Leave &s;hould be given to arm the re&s;t. All was carried with great Heat and much Vehemence; for a national Humour, of being independent on <HI>England,</HI> ferment|ed &s;o &s;trongly, among all &s;orts of People without doors, that tho&s;e, who went not into every hot Motion, that was made, were looked on as the Betrayers of their Country: And they were &s;o expo&s;ed to a popular Fury, that &s;ome of tho&s;e, who &s;tudied to &s;top this Tide, were thought to be in danger of their Lives. The Presbyterians were &s;o over-awed with this, that tho' they wi&s;hed well to the &s;ettling the Succe&s;&s;ion, they dur&s;t not openly declare it. The Dukes of <HI>Hamilton</HI> and <HI>Athol</HI> led all tho&s;e violent Mo|tions, and the whole Nation was &s;trangely inflamed.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;ters were put to a great difficulty with the Supply-Bill, and the Tack that was joined to it: If it was denied, the Army could be no longer kept up: They had run &s;o far in Ar|rear, that con&s;idering the Poverty of the Country, that could not be carried on much longer. Some &s;ugge&s;ted, that it &s;hould be pro|po&s;ed to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mini&s;try, to advance the Sub&s;i&s;tence Money, till better Mea&s;ures could be taken; but none of the <HI>Scotch</HI> Mini|&s;try would con&s;ent to that. An Army is reckoned to belong to tho&s;e who pay it: So an Army paid from <HI>England,</HI> would be called an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Army: Nor was it po&s;&s;ible to manage &s;uch a thing &s;ecretly. It was well known, that there was no Money in the <HI>Scotch</HI> Trea&s;ury to pay them, &s;o if Money were once brought into the Trea&s;ury, how &s;ecretly &s;oever, all Men mu&s;t conclude, that it came from <HI>England:</HI> And Men's Minds were then &s;o full of the Conceit of Independency, that if a Su&s;picion aro&s;e of any &s;uch Practice, probably it would have occa&s;ioned Tumults: Even the Army was &s;o kindled with this, that it was believed, that neither Officers nor Soldiers would have taken their Pay, if they had believed it came from <HI>England.</HI> It came then to this, that either the Army mu&s;t be disbanded, or the Bill mu&s;t pa&s;s: It is true, the Army was a very &s;mall one, not above 3000; but it
<PB N="399" REF="425">
was &s;o ordered, that it was double or treble officer'd; &s;o that it could have been ea&s;ily encrea&s;ed to a much greater number, if there had been occa&s;ion for it. The Officers had &s;erved long, and were Men of a good Character: So, &s;ince they were alarmed with an Inva&s;ion, which both &s;ides looked for, and the Intelligence, which the Court had from <HI>France,</HI> a&s;&s;ured them it was intended; they thought the Inconveniences ari&s;ing from the Tack might be remedied afterwards: but the breaking of the Army was &s;uch a pernicious thing, and might end &s;o fatally, that it was not to be ventured on. Therefore by common con&s;ent, a Letter was wrote to the Queen, which was &s;igned by all the Mini&s;ters there, in <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mini|&s;ters there advi&s;e the Queen to pa&s;s it.</NOTE> which they laid the whole Matter before her, every thing was &s;tated and ballanced: All concluded in an humble Advice to pa&s;s the Bill. This was very heavy on the Lord <HI>Godolphin,</HI> on who&s;e Advice the Queen chiefly relied: He &s;aw the ill Con&s;e|quences of breaking the Army, and laying that Kingdom open to an Inva&s;ion, would fall on him, if he &s;hould, in contradiction to the Advice given by the Mini&s;try of <HI>Scotland,</HI> have advi&s;ed the Queen to reject the Bill. This was under Con&s;ultation in the end of <HI>July,</HI> when our Matters abroad were yet in a great Un|certainty; for tho' the Victory at <HI>Schellemberg</HI> was a good &s;tep, yet the great Deci&s;ion was not then come: So he thought, con|&s;idering the State of Affairs, and the Accidents that might hap|pen, that it was the &s;afe&s;t thing for the Queen to comply with the Advices of tho&s;e, to whom &s;he tru&s;ted the Affairs of that Kingdom.</P>
<P>The Queen &s;ent Orders to pa&s;s the Bill: It pa&s;s'd on the <NOTE PLACE="marg">It was pa&s;s'd.</NOTE> 6th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> after the great Battle was over, but &s;everal Days before the News of it came to us. When the Act pa&s;&s;ed, Copies of it were &s;ent to <HI>England;</HI> where it was &s;oon printed, by tho&s;e who were unea&s;y at the Lord <HI>Godolphin</HI>'s holding the White Staff, and re&s;olved to make u&s;e of this again&s;t him; for the whole Blame of pa&s;&s;ing it was ca&s;t on him. It was not po&s;&s;i|ble to prove, that he had advi&s;ed the Queen to it: So &s;ome took it by another Handle, and re&s;olved to urge it again&s;t him, that he had not per&s;uaded the Queen to reject it: Tho' that &s;eemed a great Stretch, for he being a Stranger to that Kingdom, it might have been liable to more objection, if he had pre&s;umed to advi&s;e the Queen, to refu&s;e a Bill, pa&s;s'd in the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which all the Mini&s;try there advi&s;ed her to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>Severe Cen&s;ures pa&s;&s;ed on this. It was &s;aid, that the two King|doms <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cen&s;ures pa&s;s'd upon it.</NOTE> were now divided by Law, and that the <HI>Scotch</HI> were putting them&s;elves in a Po&s;ture to defend it; and all &s;aw by who&s;e Ad|vices this was done: One thing, that contributed to keep up an
<PB N="400" REF="426">
ill humour in the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> was more ju&s;tly im|puted to him: The Queen had promi&s;ed to &s;end down to them all the Examinations relating to the Plot: If the&s;e had been &s;ent down, probably in the fir&s;t Heat the Matter might have been carried far again&s;t the Duke of <HI>Queensbury.</HI> But he, who &s;taid all the while at <HI>London,</HI> got it to be repre&s;ented to the Queen, that the &s;ending down the&s;e Examinations, with the Per&s;ons con|cerned in them, would run the Se&s;&s;ion into &s;o much Heat, and into &s;uch a Length, that it would divert them quite from con&s;i|dering the Succe&s;&s;ion, and it might produce a tragical Scene. Upon the&s;e Sugge&s;tions, the Queen altered her Re&s;olution of &s;end|ing them down; tho' repeated Applications were made to her, both by the Parliament and by her Mini&s;ters, to have them &s;ent; yet no An&s;wer was made to the&s;e, nor was &s;o much as an Excu&s;e made, for not &s;ending them. The Duke of <HI>Queensbury</HI> having gained this Point, got all his Friends to join with the Party that oppo&s;ed the new Mini&s;try: This both defeated all their Projects, and &s;oftened the Spirits of tho&s;e, who were &s;o &s;et again&s;t him, that in their fir&s;t Fury no &s;top could have been put to their Pro|ceedings: But now, the Party that had de&s;igned to ruin him, was &s;o much wrought on, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance that his Friends gave them in this Se&s;&s;ion, that they re&s;olved to pre&s;erve him.</P>
<P>This was the State of that Nation, which was aggravated very odiou&s;ly all <HI>England</HI> over: It was confidently, tho', as was af|terwards known, very fal&s;ely reported, that great Quantities of Arms were brought over, and di&s;per&s;ed thro' the whole King|dom: and it being well known how poor the Nation was at that time, it was &s;aid, that tho&s;e Arms were paid for by other hands, in imitation of what it was believed Cardinal <HI>Richelieu</HI> did, in the Year 1638. Another thing was given out very ma|liciou&s;ly, by the Lord Trea&s;urer's Enemies, that he had given Directions under-hand, to hinder the declaring the Succe&s;&s;ion, and that the Secret of this was tru&s;ted to <HI>John&s;ton,</HI> who they &s;aid talked openly one way, and acted &s;ecretly another; tho' I could never &s;ee a colour of Truth in tho&s;e Reports. Great u&s;e was to be made of the Affairs of <HI>Scotland;</HI> becau&s;e there was no ground of Complaint of any thing in the Admini&s;tration at home: All the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI>'s Enemies &s;aw his chief Strength lay in the Credit that the Lord <HI>Godolphin</HI> was in at home, while he was &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful abroad: So it being impo&s;&s;ible to attack him, in &s;uch a Cour&s;e of Glory, they laid their Aims again&s;t the Lord Trea&s;urer. The Tories re&s;olved to attack him, and that di&s;po&s;ed the Whigs to pre&s;erve him; and this was &s;o managed by them, that it gave a great Turn to all our Councils at home.</P>
<P><PB N="401" REF="427">
In the beginning of <HI>November,</HI> the Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament was opened: it might well be expected, that after &s;uch a &s;ummer, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament in <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> the Addre&s;&s;es of both Hou&s;es would run in a very high &s;train: the Hou&s;e of Commons in their Addre&s;s put the &s;ucce&s;&s;es by Sea and Land on a level, and magnified both in the &s;ame expre&s;&s;ions: But the Hou&s;e of Lords in their Addre&s;s took no notice of <HI>Rook</HI> nor of the Sea. The Lower Hou&s;e of Convocation were re&s;olved to follow the example of the Hou&s;e of Commons, and would have the Sea and Land both mentioned in the &s;ame terms; but the Bi&s;hops would not vary from the pattern &s;et them by the Hou&s;e of Lords; &s;o no Addre&s;s was made by the Convocation. The Commons agreed to every thing that the Court propo&s;ed, for &s;upporting the War another year; this was carried through with great di&s;patch and unanimity: So that the main bu&s;ine&s;s of the Se&s;&s;ion was &s;oon over; all the Money-Bills were prepared and car|ried on in the regular method, without any ob&s;truction: Tho&s;e who intended to embroil matters, &s;aw it was not advi&s;able to act above board, but to proceed more covertly.</P>
<P>The Act again&s;t Occa&s;ional Conformity was again brought in, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1705. The Occa|oual Bill is again brought in; and endea|vour'd to be tack'd to a Money-Bill.</NOTE> but moderated in &s;everal Clau&s;es: For tho&s;e who pre&s;t it, were now re&s;olved to bring the terms as low as was po&s;&s;ible, in order once to carry a Bill upon that head. The Oppo&s;ition in the Hou&s;e of Commons made to it, was become &s;o con&s;iderable (for the de&s;ign was now more clearly di&s;cerned) that it was carried in that Hou&s;e only by a majority of fifty. When the Bill was to be committed, it was moved, that it &s;hould be committed to the &s;ame Committee, which was preparing the Bill for the Land-Tax: The de&s;ign of this was, that the one &s;hould be tack'd to the other, and then the Lords would have been put upon a great difficulty. If they &s;hould untack the Bill, and &s;eparate one from the other; then the Hou&s;e of Commons would have in&s;i&s;ted on a maxim, that was now &s;ettled among them, as a fundamental principle never to be departed from, that the Lords cannot alter a Money-Bill, but mu&s;t either pa&s;s it or reject it, as it is &s;ent to them: On the other hand, the Lords could not agree to any &s;uch Tack, with|out departing from that &s;olemn Re&s;olution, which was in their Books, &s;igned by mo&s;t of them, never to admit of a Tack to a Money-Bill: If they yielded now, they taught the Hou&s;e of Commons the way to impo&s;e any thing on them at their plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The party in the Hou&s;e of Commons put their whole &s;trength to the carrying this point: They went further in their de&s;ign: That which was truly aimed at, by tho&s;e in the Secret, was to break the War, and to force a Peace: They knew a Bill with this
<PB N="402" REF="428">
Tack could not pa&s;s in the Hou&s;e of Peers: Some Lords of their party told my&s;elf that they would never pa&s;s the Bill with this Tack, &s;o by this means Money would be &s;topped: This would put all matters in great confu&s;ion both at home and abroad; and di&s;po&s;e our Allies, as de&s;pairing of any help from us, to ac|cept of &s;uch terms as <HI>France</HI> would offer them: So here was an artful de&s;ign formed to break, at lea&s;t to &s;hake, the whole Al|liance. The Court was very apprehen&s;ive of this, and the Lord <HI>Godolphin</HI> oppo&s;ed it with much zeal: The Party di&s;owned the de&s;ign for &s;ome time, 'till they had brought up their whole &s;trength, and thought they were &s;ure of a Majority.</P>
<P>The Debate held long: Tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed it &s;aid, this now aimed at was a change of the whole Con&s;titution; and was in effect turning it into a Commonwealth: for it imported the de|nying, not only to the Lords, but to the Crown, the free u&s;e of their Negative in the Legi&s;lature; if this was once &s;ettled, then as often as the publick occa&s;ions made a Money-Bill nece&s;&s;ary, every thing that the Majority in their Hou&s;e had a mind to, would be tacked to it. It is true &s;ome Tacks had been made to Money-Bills in King <HI>Charles</HI>'s time; but even the&s;e had &s;till &s;ome relation to the Money that was given: But here a Bill, who&s;e operation was only for one year, and which determined as &s;oon as the four &s;hillings in the pound was paid, was to have a perpetual Law tacked to it, that mu&s;t continue &s;till in force, after the greate&s;t part of the Act was expired and dead: To all this, in an&s;wer, &s;ome precedents were oppo&s;ed, and the nece&s;&s;ity of the Bill for the pre&s;ervation of the Church was urged, which they &s;aw was not like to pa&s;s, unle&s;s &s;ent to the Lords &s;o accompanied; which &s;ome thought was very wittily pre&s;&s;ed, by calling it a portion annexed to the Church, as in a Marriage; and they &s;aid they did not doubt but tho&s;e of the Court would be&s;tir them&s;elves to get it pa&s;s'd, when it was accompanied with two Millions as its Price.</P>
<P>Upon the Divi&s;ion 134 were for the Tack, and 250 were <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Tack was rejected.</NOTE> again&s;t it: So that de&s;ign was lo&s;t by tho&s;e, who had built all their hopes upon it, and were now highly offended with &s;ome of their own party, who had by their oppo&s;ition wrought them&s;elves into good places, and for&s;ook that Intere&s;t, to which they owed their advancement: The&s;e, to redeem them&s;elves with their old friends, &s;eemed &s;till zealous for the Bill, which after went on coldly and &s;lowly in the Hou&s;e of Commons, for they lo&s;t all hopes of carrying it in the Hou&s;e of Lords, now that the Mine they had laid was &s;prung.</P>
<P>While this was going on in the Hou&s;e of Commons, the De|bate <NOTE PLACE="marg">Debates concerning <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> about the <HI>Scotch</HI> Act was taken up with great heat in the
<PB N="403" REF="429">
Hou&s;e of Lords: The ill effects that were like to follow upon it were opened, in very tragical &s;trains: It was after much de|claiming moved, that the Lords might pa&s;s &s;ome Votes upon it. The Tories who pre&s;&s;ed this, intended to add a &s;evere Vote again&s;t all tho&s;e who had advi&s;ed it; and it was vi&s;ible at whom this was aimed. The Whigs diverted this: They &s;aid the putting a Vote again&s;t an Act pa&s;&s;ed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> looked like the claiming &s;ome Superiority over them, which &s;eemed very improper at that time, &s;ince that Kingdom was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a National jealou&s;y on this head; that would be much encrea&s;ed by &s;uch a Proceeding: More moderate methods were therefore propo&s;ed and agreed to, in order to the making up of a breach in this I&s;land, with which they &s;eemed to be then threatned. So an Act was brought in, impowering the Queen to name Commi&s;&s;ioners to treat of a full Union of both Kingdoms, as &s;oon as the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hould pa&s;s an Act to the &s;ame purpo&s;e: but if no &s;uch Union &s;hould be agreed on, or if the &s;ame Succe&s;&s;ion to the Crown, with that of <HI>England,</HI> &s;hould not be enacted by a day prefixed, then it was enacted that after that day no <HI>Scotchman,</HI> that was not Re&s;ident in <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Ireland,</HI> or employed in the Queen's &s;ervice by &s;ea or land, &s;hould be e&s;teem'd a natural-born Subject of <HI>England:</HI> They added to this, a Prohibition of the Importation of <HI>Scotch</HI> Cattle, and the Manufacture of <HI>Scotland:</HI> All this fell in the Hou&s;e of Commons, when &s;ent down to them, becau&s;e of the Money-Penalties, which were put in the &s;everal Clau&s;es of the Bill. The Commons were re&s;olved to adhere to a notion, that had now taken &s;uch root among them, that it could not be &s;haken, that the Lords could not put any &s;uch Clau&s;e in a Bill begun with them: This was wholly new; penalties upon tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions could not be con&s;trued to be a giving of money: The Lords were clearly in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of proceeding thus; &s;o that the calling it in que&s;tion was an attempt on the &s;hare which the Lords had in the Legi&s;|lature: The Commons let this Bill lie on the table, and began a new one to the &s;ame purpo&s;e; it pa&s;&s;ed: And the following <HI>Chri&s;t|mas</HI> was the day prefixed for the <HI>Scotch</HI> to enact the Succe&s;&s;ion, or on failure thereof, then this Act was to have its effect. A great coldne&s;s appeared in many of the Commons, who u&s;ed to be hot on le&s;s important occa&s;ions: they &s;eemed not to de&s;ire that the <HI>Scotch</HI> &s;hould &s;ettle the Succe&s;&s;ions: And it was vi&s;ible, that &s;ome of them hoped, that the Lords would have u&s;ed their Bill, as they had u&s;ed that &s;ent down by the Lords: Many of them were le&s;s concerned in the fate of the Bill, becau&s;e it diverted the cen&s;ure, which they had intended to fix on the Lord-Trea&s;urer. The Lords were aware of this, and pa&s;s'd the Bill.</P>
<P><PB N="404" REF="430">
Tho&s;e who wi&s;h'd well to the Union, were afraid that the Prohibition, and the declaring the <HI>Scots</HI> Aliens after the day pre|fixed, would be looked on as threatnings: And they &s;aw cau&s;e to apprehend, that ill-temper'd men in that kingdom, would u&s;e this as a handle to divert that Nation, which was already much &s;oured, from hearkning to any motion, that might tend to pro|mote the Union, or the declaring the Succe&s;&s;ion: It was given out by the&s;e, that this was an indignity done their Kingdom, and that they ought not &s;o much as to treat with a Nation, that threatned them in &s;uch a manner. The Marque&s;s of <HI>Tweedale</HI> excu&s;ed him&s;elf from &s;erving longer; &s;o the Duke of <HI>Argyle,</HI> who&s;e father was lately dead, was named to be &s;ent down Com|mi&s;&s;ioner to hold a Parliament in <HI>Scotland:</HI> He was then very young, and was very brave.</P>
<P>This being di&s;patched ea&s;ier than was expected, the Parliament <NOTE PLACE="marg">Complaints of the Ad|miralty.</NOTE> went on the other bu&s;ine&s;s; Complaints of an ill management both at the board of the Prince's Council, and at &s;ea ro&s;e very high: This Hou&s;e of Commons, during the whole continuance of the Parliament, never appointed a Committee to look into tho&s;e matters, which had been formerly a main part of their care: They &s;aw things were ill conducted, but the chief managers of &s;ea-affairs were men of their party, and that atoned for all faults, and made them unwilling to find them out, or to cen&s;ure them: The truth was, the Prince was prevailed on to continue &s;till in the Admiralty, by tho&s;e who &s;heltered them&s;elves under his name: tho' this brought a great Load on the Government. The Lords went on as they had done the former Se&s;&s;ion, examining into all complaints: They named two Committees, the one to ex|amine the books of the Admiralty, the other to con&s;ider the pro|ceedings at &s;ea: No progre&s;s was made in the fir&s;t of the&s;e; for tho' there was a great deal &s;ugge&s;ted in private, yet &s;ince this &s;eemed to be complaining of the Prince, none would appear directly again&s;t him: But the other afforded matter enough, both for enquiry and cen&s;ure: The mo&s;t important, and that which had the wor&s;t con&s;equences was, that tho' there were 22 &s;hips appointed for crui&s;ing, yet they had followed that &s;ervice &s;o re|mi&s;sly, and the orders &s;ent them were &s;o languid, and &s;o little urgent, that three diligent crui&s;ing Ships could have performed all the &s;ervices done by that numerous fleet: This was made out in a &s;cheme, in which all the days of their being out at &s;ea were reckoned up, which did not exceed what three Crui&s;ers might have performed. It did not appear, whether this was only the effect of &s;loth or ignorance, or if there lay any de&s;igned treachery at bottom: It &s;eemed very plain, that there was treachery &s;ome|where,
<PB N="405" REF="431">
at lea&s;t among the Under-Officers: For a <HI>French</HI> Privateer being taken, they found among his Papers In&s;tructions &s;ent him by his Owners, in which he was directed to lie in &s;ome &s;tations, and to avoid others: and it happened that this agreed &s;o exactly with the orders &s;ent from the Admiralty, that it &s;eemed that could not be by chance, but that the directions were &s;ent, upon &s;ight of the orders. The Queen began this winter to come to the Hou&s;e of Lords upon great occa&s;ions to hear their debates, which as it was of good u&s;e for her better Information, &s;o it was very &s;erviceable in bringing the Hou&s;e into better order. The fir&s;t time She came, was when the Debate was taken up concerning the <HI>Scotch</HI> Act: She knew the Lord-Trea&s;urer was aimed at by it, and &s;he diverted the &s;torm by her endeavours, as well as &s;he re&s;trained it by her pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>She came likewi&s;e thither to hear the debates upon the Bill <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bill again&s;t Oc|ca&s;ional Conformity debated and rejected by the Lords.</NOTE> again&s;t Occa&s;ional Conformity, which was &s;ent up by the Com|mons; if it had not been for the Queen's being pre&s;ent, there would have been no long debate on that head, for it was &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to &s;ay much, that had not been formerly &s;aid; but to give the Queen full information, &s;ince it was &s;uppo&s;ed, that &s;he had heard that matter only on one &s;ide, it was re&s;olved to open the whole matter in her hearing: The topicks mo&s;t in&s;i&s;ted on were, the quiet that we enjoyed by the Toleration, on which head the &s;everities of former Reigns were laid open, both in their inju&s;tice, cruelty, and their being managed only to advance Po|pery, and other bad de&s;igns: The peaceable behaviour of the Di&s;&s;enters, and the zeal they expre&s;&s;ed for the Queen, and her Government, was al&s;o copiou&s;ly &s;et forth; while others &s;hewed a malignity to it. That which was chiefly urged was, that every new Law made in the matter, altered the &s;tate of things, from what it was, when the Act for Toleration fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ed; this gave the Di&s;&s;enters an alarm, they might from thence ju&s;tly conclude, that one &s;tep would be made after another, 'till the whole Effect of that Act &s;hould be overturned. It did not appear from the behaviour of any among them, that they were not contented with the Toleration they enjoyed, or that they were carrying on de|&s;igns again&s;t the Church: In that ca&s;e it might be rea&s;onable to look for a further &s;ecurity, but nothing tending that way, was &s;o much as pretended: All went on jealou&s;ies and fears, the com|mon topicks of Sedition. On the other hand, to &s;upport the Bill, all &s;tories were brought up to &s;hew, how re&s;tle&s;s and unquiet that &s;ort of men had been in former times. When it came to the que&s;tion, whether the Bill &s;hould be read a &s;econd time or not, it went for the negative by a majority of 20 Lords.</P>
<P><PB N="406" REF="432">
Another debate, that brought the Queen to the Hou&s;e, was concerning <HI>Wat&s;on,</HI> late Lord Bi&s;hop of <HI>St. David's:</HI> His bu&s;ine&s;s had been kept long on foot in the Courts below, by all the me|thods <NOTE PLACE="marg">Bi&s;hop <HI>Wat|&s;on</HI>'s prac|tices.</NOTE> of delay that Lawyers could invent: After five years plead|ing the concluding judgment was given in the Exchequer, that he had no right to the Temporalities of that Bi&s;hoprick: And that being affirmed in the Exchequer-Chamber, it was now by a Writ of Error, brought before the Lords, in the la&s;t Re&s;ort: But as the Hou&s;e &s;eemed now to be &s;et, he had no mind to let it go to a final deci&s;ion: So he delayed the a&s;&s;igning the Errors of the judgment, 'till the days were lap&s;ed, in which, according to a &s;tanding order, Errors ought to be a&s;&s;igned, upon a Writ of Error: in default of which, the Record was to be &s;ent back. He &s;uffered the time to lap&s;e, tho' particular notice was ordered to be given him, on the la&s;t day, in which, ac|cording to the &s;tanding order, he might have a&s;&s;igned his Er|rors: And the Hou&s;e &s;ate that day &s;ome hours on purpo&s;e waiting for it. Some weeks after that, when the Se&s;&s;ion was &s;o near an end, that he thought his Cau&s;e could not be heard during the Se&s;&s;ion, and &s;o mu&s;t in cour&s;e have been put off to another Se&s;&s;ion; he petitioned for leave to a&s;&s;ign his Errors: This was one of the mo&s;t &s;olemn orders, that related to the judicature of the Lords, and had been the mo&s;t con&s;tantly &s;tood to: It was not therefore thought rea&s;onable to break through it, in favour of &s;o bad a man, of whom they were all a&s;hamed, if parties could have any &s;hame: He had affected, in every &s;tep he had made, to &s;eek out all po&s;&s;ible delays, for keeping the See &s;till void, which by rea&s;on of a bad Bi&s;hop and a long Vacancy, was fallen into great di&s;order: Yet after all this, he had &s;till by law the benefit of a Writ of Error, which he might bring in any &s;ub&s;equent Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament.</P>
<P>Upon this the Queen re&s;olved to fill that See: And &s;he pro|moted to it, the celebrated Dr. <HI>Bull,</HI> who had writ the learnede&s;t <NOTE PLACE="marg">Some pro|motions in the Church.</NOTE> Treati&s;e, that this Age had produced, of the Doctrine of the pri|mitive Church concerning the Trinity: This had been &s;o well received all <HI>Europe</HI> over, that in an A&s;&s;embly General of the Clergy of <HI>France,</HI> the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Meaux</HI> was de&s;ired to write over to a Corre&s;pondent he had in <HI>London,</HI> that they had &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of the &s;ervice he had done their common Faith, that up|on it they &s;ent him their particular thanks: I read the Letter, and &s;o I can deliver it for a certain truth, how uncommon &s;oever it may &s;eem to be. The Queen had a little before this promoted Dr. <HI>Beveridge</HI> to the See of <HI>St. A&s;aph,</HI> who had &s;hewed him&s;elf very learned in the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Knowledge. They were both
<PB N="407" REF="433">
pious and devout Men, but were now declining; both of them being old, and not like to hold out long. Soon after this the See of <HI>Lincoln</HI> became vacant by that Bi&s;hop's death: Dr. <HI>Wake</HI> was after &s;ome time promoted to it: A man eminently learned, an excellent writer, a good preacher, and, which is above all, a man of an exemplary life.</P>
<P>A de&s;ign was formed in this Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, but there <NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;ign: with relation to the Elec|tore&s;s of <HI>Planover.</HI></NOTE> was not &s;trength enough to carry it on at this time, the Earl of <HI>Ro|che&s;ter</HI> gave a hint of it in the Hou&s;e of Lords, by &s;aying that he had a motion of great con&s;equence to the &s;ecurity of the nation, which he would not make at this time, but would do it when next they &s;hould meet together. He &s;aid no more to the Hou&s;e, but in private di&s;cour&s;e he owned it was for bringing over the Electore&s;s of <HI>Hanover</HI> to live in <HI>England:</HI> Upon this I will digre&s;s a little, to open the de&s;ign and the views, which he and &s;ome others might have in this motion.</P>
<P>It &s;eemed not natural to believe that a Party, which had been all along backward at be&s;t, and cold in every &s;tep that was made in &s;ettling the Succe&s;&s;ion in that Family, &s;hould become all on the &s;udden, &s;uch Converts as to be zealous for it; &s;o it was not an unrea&s;onable jealou&s;y to &s;u&s;pect, that &s;omewhat lay hid under it: It was thought that they either knew, or did apprehend, that this would not be acceptable to the Queen; and they, being highly di&s;plea&s;ed with the mea&s;ures &s;he took, went into this de|&s;ign both to vex her, and in hopes that a Faction might ari&s;e out of it, which might breed a di&s;traction in our Councils, and &s;ome of them might hope thereby to revive the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI>'s pre|ten&s;ions. They reckoned &s;uch a motion would be popular: And if either the Court or the Whigs, on whom the Court was now beginning to look more favourably, &s;hould oppo&s;e it, this would ca&s;t a load on them as men, who after all the zeal they had ex|pre&s;&s;ed for that Succe&s;&s;ion, did now, upon the hopes of favour at Court, throw it up: And tho&s;e who had been hitherto con|&s;idered as the Enemies of that Hou&s;e, might hope by this motion to overcome all the prejudices that the nation had taken up again&s;t them; and they might create a merit to them&s;elves in the minds of that Family, by this early zeal, which they re&s;olved now to expre&s;s for it.</P>
<P>This was &s;et on foot among all the party: But the more &s;incere among them could not be prevailed on to act &s;o fal&s;e a part, tho' they were told this was the likelie&s;t way, to advance the Pre|tended Prince of <HI>Wales</HI>'s Intere&s;ts. <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Hou&s;e of Com|mons com|mitted to pri&s;on &s;ome of the men of <HI>Arlesbury.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>I now come to give an account of the la&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s of this Se&s;|&s;ion, with which the Parliament ended; it was formerly told,
<PB N="408" REF="434">
what proceedings had been at law upon the Election at <HI>Ailesbury;</HI> the judgment that the Lords gave in that matter was executed, and upon that five others of the inhabitants brought their actions again&s;t the Con&s;tables, upon the &s;ame grounds. The Hou&s;e of Commons looked on this as a great contempt of their Votes, and they voted this a Breach of Privilege, to which they added a new, and 'till then unheard-of Crime, that it was contrary to the De|claration that they had made; upon that they &s;ent their Me&s;&s;enger for the&s;e five men, and committed them to <HI>Newgate,</HI> where they lay three months pri&s;oners; they were all the while well-&s;upplied and much vi&s;ited; &s;o they lay without making any application to the Hou&s;e of Commons: It was not thought advi&s;able to move in &s;uch a matter, 'till all the Money-Bills were pa&s;&s;ed; then mo|tions were made, in the Interval between the Terms, upon the Statute for a <HI>Habeas Corpus;</HI> but the Statute relating only to com|mitments by the Royal Authority, this did not lie within it.</P>
<P>When the Term came, a motion was made in the Queen's Bench upon the Common-Law, in behalf of the Pri&s;oners for a <HI>Habeas Corpus;</HI> the Lawyers who moved it, produced the Com|mitment, in which their offence was &s;et forth, that they had claimed the benefit of the law in oppo&s;ition to a Vote of the Hou&s;e of Commons to the contrary; they &s;aid the &s;ubjects were governed by the Laws, which they might, and were bound to know, and not by the Votes of a Hou&s;e of Parliament, which they were nei|ther bound to know, nor to obey: Three of the Judges were of opinion, that the Court could take no cognizance of that matter; the Chief-Ju&s;tice was of another mind; he thought a general war|rant of commitment for breach of privilege was of the nature of an execution; and &s;ince the ground of the commitment was &s;pe|cified in the warrant, he thought it plainly appeared, that the pri&s;oners had been guilty of no legal offence, and that therefore they ought to be di&s;charged: He was but one again&s;t three, &s;o the Pri&s;oners were remanded.</P>
<P>Upon that they moved for a Writ of Error, to bring the matter before the Lords; that was only to be come at, by petitioning the Queen to order it: The Commons were alarmed at this, and made an Addre&s;s to the Queen, &s;etting forth, that they had pa&s;&s;ed all the Money-Bills, therefore they hoped her Maje&s;ty would not grant this. Ten Judges agreed, that in civil matters a petition for a Writ of Error was a petition of right, and not of grace; two of them only were of another mind; it was therefore thought a very &s;trange thing, which might have mo&s;t pernicious con&s;equences, for a Hou&s;e of Commons to de&s;ire the Queen, not to grant a pe|tition of right, which was plainly a breach of Law and of her
<PB N="409" REF="435">
Coronation-Oath; they al&s;o took on them to affirm, that the Writ did not lie; tho' that was clearly the work of the Judi|cature to declare, whether it lay or not, and that was unque&s;ti|onably the Right of the Lords; They only could determine that; the &s;upplying the publick occa&s;ions was a &s;trange con&s;ideration to be offered the Queen, as an argument to per&s;uade her to act again&s;t Law: as if they had pretended that they had bribed her to infringe the Law; and to deny Ju&s;tice: Money given for pub|lick &s;ervice was given to the Country, and to them&s;elves, as pro|perly as to the Queen.</P>
<P>The Queen an&s;wered their Addre&s;s, and in it &s;aid, that the &s;topping Proceedings at Law, was a matter of &s;uch con&s;equence, that &s;he mu&s;t con&s;ider well of it: This was thought &s;o cold, that they returned her no thanks for it; tho' a well-compo&s;ed Hou&s;e of Commons would certainly have thanked her, for that tender regard to Law and Ju&s;tice. The Hou&s;e of Commons carried their anger farther; they ordered the Pri&s;oners to be taken out of <HI>New|gate,</HI> and to be kept by their Serjeant; they al&s;o ordered the Law|yers and the Sollicitors to be taken into cu&s;tody, for appearing in behalf of the Pri&s;oners: The&s;e were &s;uch &s;trange and unheard|of Proceedings, that by them the minds of all people were much alienated from the Hou&s;e of Commons. But the Pri&s;oners were under &s;uch management, and &s;o well &s;upported, that they would not &s;ubmit nor ask pardon of the Hou&s;e; it was generally be|lieved, that they were &s;upplied and managed by the Lord <HI>Wharton;</HI> they petitioned the Hou&s;e of Lords for relief; and the Lords re|&s;olved to proceed in the matter, by &s;ure and regular &s;teps: They fir&s;t came to &s;ome general Re&s;olutions; That neither Hou&s;e of Parliament could a&s;&s;ume or create any new Privilege, that they had not been formerly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of; That Subjects claiming their Rights in a Cour&s;e of Law, again&s;t tho&s;e who had no Privilege, could not be a Breach of Privilege of either Hou&s;e; That the impri&s;oning the men of <HI>Ailesbury,</HI> for acting contrary to a De|claration made by the Hou&s;e of Commons, was again&s;t Law; That the committing their Friends and their Coun&s;el for a&s;&s;i&s;ting them, in order to the procuring their Liberty in a legal way, was contrary to Law; and that the Writ of Error could not be denied without breaking the <HI>Magna Charta</HI> and the Laws of <HI>England.</HI> The&s;e Re&s;olutions were communicated to the Hou&s;e of Commons at a Conference.</P>
<P>They made a long An&s;wer to them: In it they &s;et forth, that the right of determining Elections was lodged only with them, and that therefore they only could judge who had a Right to elect; they only were the Judges of their own Privileges, the Lords could
<PB N="410" REF="436">
not intermeddle in it; they quoted very copiou&s;ly the Proceedings in the year 1675, upon an Appeal brought again&s;t a Member of their Hou&s;e; they &s;aid their Pri&s;oners ought only to apply them|&s;elves to them for their liberty; and that no motion had ever been made for a Writ of Error in &s;uch a ca&s;e. Upon this &s;econd Con|ference according to form, the matter was brought to a free Con|ference, where the point was fully argued on both &s;ides; the City and the Body of the Nation were on the Lords &s;ide in the matter. Upon this, the Lords drew up a full repre&s;entation of the whole thing, and laid it before the Queen, with an earne&s;t prayer to her Maje&s;ty, to give order for the Writ of Error; this was thought &s;o well drawn, that &s;ome preferred it to tho&s;e of the former Se&s;&s;ions; it contained a long and clear deduction of the whole affair, with great decency of &s;tyle, but with many heavy reflections on the Hou&s;e of Commons.</P>
<P>By this time the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of the Se&s;&s;ion was brought to a conclu&s;ion; for the Lords, who had the Money-Bills, would not pa&s;s them, 'till this was ended: They carried their Repre&s;en|tation to the Queen, who in an&s;wer to it told them, that &s;he would have granted the Writ of Error, but &s;he &s;aw it was nece&s;|&s;ary to put a pre&s;ent conclu&s;ion to the Se&s;&s;ion. This being reported to the Hou&s;e, was looked on by them as a clear deci&s;ion in their fayour; therefore they ordered their humble thanks to be imme|diately returned to her Maje&s;ty for it: An hour after that, the Queen came to the Hou&s;e of Lords, and pa&s;&s;ed all the Bills, and ended the Se&s;&s;ion, with a Speech full of thanks for the Supplies &s;o readily granted; &s;he took notice with regret of the Effects of the ill-humour and animo&s;ity, that had appeared; and &s;poke of the narrow e&s;cape we had made, which &s;he hoped would teach all per&s;ons to avoid &s;uch dangerous Experiments for the future; this was univer&s;ally under&s;tood to be meant of the <HI>Tack,</HI> as indeed it could be meant of nothing el&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus this Se&s;&s;ion, and with it this Parliament came to an end: it was no &s;mall ble&s;&s;ing to the Queen, and to the Nation, that <NOTE PLACE="marg">The end of the Par|liament</NOTE> they got well out of &s;uch hands: They had di&s;covered, on many occa&s;ions, and very manife&s;tly, what lay at bottom with mo&s;t of them; but they had not skill enough to know how to manage their advantages, and to make u&s;e of their numbers; the con&s;tant Succe&s;&s;es, with which God had ble&s;&s;ed the Queen's Reign, put it out of their power to compa&s;s that, which was aimed at by them; the forcing a Peace, and of con&s;equence the delivering all up to <HI>France.</HI> Sir <HI>Chri&s;topher Mu&s;grave,</HI> the wi&s;e&s;t Man of the Party, died before the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion; and by their conduct after his death, it appeared, that they wanted his Direction: He had been at the
<PB N="411" REF="437">
head of the oppo&s;ition, that was made in the la&s;t Reign from the beginning to the end; but he gave up many points of great im|portance in the critical minute, for which I had good rea&s;on to believe, that he had 12000 pounds from the late King, at different times: At his death it appeared, that he was much richer, than by any vi&s;ible computation he could be valued at: Which made &s;ome ca&s;t an Imputation on his memory, as if he had received great &s;ums even from <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude the relation of this Parliament with an account <NOTE PLACE="marg">Bills were no pa&s;&s;ed</NOTE> of &s;ome things, that were begun, but not perfected by them: There was a Bill offered for the Naturalization of &s;ome Hundreds of <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> to which the Commons added a Clau&s;e, di&s;abling the per&s;ons &s;o naturalized, from voting in Elections of Parliament; the true rea&s;on of this was, becau&s;e it was ob&s;erved that the <HI>French</HI> among us gave in all Elections their Votes, for tho&s;e who were mo&s;t zealous again&s;t <HI>France:</HI> and yet, with an apparent di&s;ingenuity, &s;ome gave it as a rea&s;on for &s;uch a Clau&s;e, that they mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;o partial to the Intere&s;ts of their own Country, that it was not fit to give them any &s;hare in our Government. The Lords looked on this as a new attempt, and the Clau&s;e added was a plain contradiction to the body of the Bill, which gave them all the Rights of natural-born Subjects; and this took from them the chief of them all, the chu&s;ing their Repre&s;entatives in Parlia|ment: They would not agree to it, and the Commons re&s;olved not to depart from it; &s;o without coming to a free Conference, the Bill fell with the Se&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Another Bill was begun by the Lords again&s;t the Papi&s;ts: It was occa&s;ioned by &s;everal complaints brought from many parts of the Kingdom, chiefly from <HI>Che&s;hire,</HI> of the practices and in&s;o|lence of tho&s;e of that Religion: So a Bill was ordered to be brought in, with Clau&s;es in it, that would have made the Act, pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t them four years before, prove effectual; which for want of the&s;e, has hitherto been of no effect at all: This pa&s;&s;ed in the Hou&s;e of Lords, and was &s;ent to the Commons. They had no mind to pa&s;s it; but to avoid the ill effects of their refu&s;ing &s;uch a Bill, they added a Clau&s;e to it, containing &s;evere Penalties on Papi&s;ts who &s;hould once take the Oaths, and come into the Com|munion of our Church, if they &s;hould be guilty of any Occa|&s;ional Conformity with Popery afterwards: They fancied that this of Occa&s;ional Conformity was &s;o odious to the Lords, that every Clau&s;e that condemned it, would be rejected by them: But when they came to under&s;tand that the Lords were re&s;olved to agree to the Clau&s;e, they would not put it to that hazard: So the Bill lay on their Table, and &s;lept 'till the Prorogation.</P>
<P><PB N="412" REF="438">
A General Self-denying Bill was offered in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, by tho&s;e very Men, who in the fir&s;t Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, when they hoped for Places them&s;elves, had oppo&s;ed the motion of &s;uch a Bill with great indignation: Now the &s;cene was a little altered, they &s;aw they were not like to be Favourites, &s;o they pre|tended to be Patriots. This looked &s;o &s;trangely in them, that it was rejected: But another Bill of a more re&s;trained nature pa&s;&s;ed, di&s;abling &s;ome Officers, particularly tho&s;e that were concerned in the Prize-Office, from &s;erving in Parliament: To this a general Clau&s;e was added, that di&s;abled all who held any Office, that had been created &s;ince the year 1684, or any Office that &s;hould be created for the future, from &s;itting in Parliament: This pa&s;&s;ed among them, and was &s;ent to the Lords; who did not think fit to agree to &s;o general a Clau&s;e, but con&s;ented to a particular di&s;|ability, put on &s;ome Offices by name: The Commons did not agree to this Alteration; they would have all or nothing: So the Bill fell.</P>
<P>The conclu&s;ion of the Parliament &s;et the whole Nation in a general ferment; both &s;ides &s;tudied how to di&s;po&s;e people's minds in the new Elections, with great indu&s;try and zeal: All people looked on the Affairs of <HI>France,</HI> as reduced to &s;uch a &s;tate, that the War could not run beyond the period of the next Parliament: A well-cho&s;en one mu&s;t prove a publick ble&s;&s;ing, not only to <HI>England,</HI> but to all <HI>Europe;</HI> as a bad one would be fatal to us at home, as well as to our Allies abroad: The Affairs of <HI>France</HI> were run very low: All methods of rai&s;ing money were now exhau&s;ted, and could afford no great &s;upplies: So, in imi|tation of our Exchequer-Bills, they began to give out Mint-Bills; but they could not create that confidence, which is ju&s;tly put in Parliamentary credit. The <HI>French</HI> had hopes from their Party here in <HI>England,</HI> and there was a disjointing in the &s;everal Pro|vinces of the <HI>United Netherlands:</HI> But as long as we were firm and united, we had a great influence on the States, at lea&s;t to keep things entire during the War: So it was vi&s;ible that a good Elec|tion in <HI>England,</HI> mu&s;t give &s;uch a pro&s;pect for three years, as would have a great Influence on all the Affairs of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t, before I end the relation of the Parliament, &s;ay &s;ome|what <NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceedings in the Con|vocation.</NOTE> of the Convocation, that attended upon it, tho' it was then &s;o little con&s;idered, that &s;carce any notice was taken of them, and they de&s;erved that no mention &s;hould be made of them. The Lower Hou&s;e continued to proceed with much indecent vi|olence: They &s;till held their intermediate Se&s;&s;ions, and brought up injurious and reflecting Addre&s;&s;es to the Upper Hou&s;e, which gave a very large exerci&s;e to the patience and forbearance of the
<PB N="413" REF="439">
Archbi&s;hop and Bi&s;hops; the Archbi&s;hop, after he had born long with their perver&s;ene&s;s, and &s;aw no good effect of it, proceeded to an Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Monition again&s;t their intermediate meetings: This put a &s;top to that, for they would not venture on the Cen|&s;ures, that mu&s;t in cour&s;e follow, if no regard was had to the Mo|nition. At the final Prorogation, the Archbi&s;hop di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them with a wi&s;e well-compo&s;ed Speech; he laid open to them their indecent behaviour, and the many wrong &s;teps they had made; to this he added a &s;evere, but grave reprimand, with much good advice. The governing men among them were head&s;trong and fac|tious, and de&s;igned to force them&s;elves into Preferments, by the noi&s;e they made, and by this ill humour that they endeavoured to &s;pread among the Clergy, who were generally &s;oured, even with relation to the Queen her&s;elf, beyond what could be ima|gined po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Now having given a full relation of our Coun&s;els and other Af|fairs at home, I &s;hall next con&s;ider the Progre&s;s of tho&s;e abroad. The fir&s;t operation of the Campaign was before <HI>Gibraltar: Lake</HI> was &s;ailing from <HI>Lisbon</HI> thither, and as he went out he met <HI>Dilks,</HI> who was &s;ent from <HI>England</HI> to encrea&s;e his Force; by this Ad|dition he had a &s;trong Fleet of 30 Men of War, &s;o he held on his cour&s;e with all expedition, hoping to find <HI>Pointy</HI> in the Bay of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Siege of <HI>Gibraltar</HI> rai&s;ed.</NOTE> <HI>Gibraltar;</HI> but a great Storm had blown all, but five Ships, up the <HI>Mediterranean. Pointy</HI> remained only with the&s;e, when he was &s;urpri&s;ed by <HI>Lake,</HI> who did quickly overpower him, and took three Capital Ships; the other two, that were the greate&s;t of them, were run a&s;hore, and burnt near <HI>Marbella. Lake</HI> &s;ailed to the <HI>Levant,</HI> to &s;ee if he could overtake tho&s;e Ships, that the Wind had driven from the re&s;t; but after a fruitle&s;s pur&s;uit for &s;ome days, he returned back to <HI>Gibraltar:</HI> That Garri&s;on was now &s;o well &s;upplied, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> lo&s;t all hopes of being able to take it; &s;o they rai&s;ed the Siege, turning it into a very feeble Blockade. This advantage came at the &s;ame time, that <HI>Verue</HI> was lo&s;t, to ballance that.</P>
<P>Now the Campaign was to be opened, the Duke of <HI>Marlbo|rough</HI> de&s;igned that the <HI>Mo&s;elle</HI> &s;hould be the Scene of Action, and care had been taken to lay up Magazines of all &s;orts in <HI>Triers:</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of <HI>Marl|borough</HI> marched to <HI>Triers.</HI></NOTE> The States con&s;ented, that he &s;hould carry the greate&s;t part of their Army to the <HI>Mo&s;elle,</HI> and re&s;olved to lie on the Defen&s;ive upon their own Frontiers; for they reckoned that how &s;trong &s;oever the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI>'s Army was at that time, yet when&s;oever <HI>France</HI> &s;hould be pre&s;&s;ed, with &s;o great a Force as they reckoned would be on the <HI>Mo&s;elle,</HI> he would be ordered to &s;end &s;uch De|tachments thither, that his Army would be quickly dimini&s;hed,
<PB N="414" REF="440">
and &s;o would not have the &s;uperiour &s;trength long. Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Baden</HI> &s;eemed to like this Scheme of the Campaign &s;o well, and had concurred &s;o cordially in the concert of it, during the Winter, that no doubt was made of his being both able and willing, to en|ter upon this new Scene of the War: But as the Duke of <HI>Marl|borough</HI> was &s;etting out, depending on his Concurrence, he re|ceived an Expre&s;s from him, excu&s;ing him&s;elf both on his own want of Health, and becau&s;e the Force he had about him was not con&s;iderable, nor was that, which he expected, like to come to him &s;o &s;oon as might be wi&s;hed for. This could not &s;top the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> who had &s;et his heart on opening the Cam|paign in tho&s;e Parts, and had great hopes of Succe&s;s: &s;o he re|&s;olved to pu&s;h the matter, as far as he could. He went to the Prince of <HI>Baden</HI> to concert Matters with him; who&s;e ill Health &s;eemed only to be a Pretence: It was true, that the Princes and Circles of the Empire had not &s;ent in their Quotas, but it appeared that there was already &s;trength enough, in conjunction with the Army, that the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> was to bring, to advance, and open the Campaign with great advantage, at lea&s;t 'till De|tachments &s;hould come from other Parts: The Prince of <HI>Baden</HI> at la&s;t con&s;ented to this, and promi&s;ed to follow, with all the Forces he could bring.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> was &s;o &s;atisfied with the&s;e A&s;&s;uran|ces, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Expecting the Prince of <HI>Baden.</HI></NOTE> that he came back to his Army, and quickened their March, &s;o that he brought them to <HI>Triers;</HI> and he advanced eight Leagues further, through &s;o many Defil&eacute;s, that the <HI>French</HI> might ea&s;ily have made his March both dangerous and difficult. He po&s;ted him&s;elf very near Mare&s;chal <HI>Villars</HI>'s Camp, not doubting but that the Prince of <HI>Baden</HI> would quickly follow him: In&s;tead of that, he repeated his former excu&s;e of want of Health and Force. That which gave the wor&s;t &s;u&s;picions of him was, that it appeared plainly, that the <HI>French</HI> knew what he intended to do, and their Management &s;hewed they depended on it; for they ordered no Detachments to encrea&s;e M. <HI>Villars</HI>'s Army: On the contrary, the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> having the &s;uperiour Force, pre&s;&s;ed the States on their Frontier. <HI>Huy</HI> was be&s;ieged and taken, after it had beyond all expectation held out ten days: <HI>Liege</HI> was attacked next; the Town was taken, but the Citadel held out. Upon this, the States &s;ent to the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> to march back with all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te; he had then eat up the Forage round about him, and was out of all hope, of the Prince of <HI>Baden</HI>'s coming to join him; &s;o he &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of marching back, after he had lo&s;t &s;ome weeks in a fruitle&s;s Attempt: He made &s;uch ha&s;te in his March, that he lo&s;t many of his Men in the way, by fatigue and
<PB N="415" REF="441">
de&s;ertion; the <HI>French</HI> gave him no trouble, neither while he lay &s;o near their Camp, nor when he drew off, to march away with &s;o much ha&s;te. To compleat the ill Conduct of the <HI>Germans,</HI> tho&s;e who were left with the Magazines at <HI>Triers,</HI> pretending danger, de&s;troyed them all, and abandoning <HI>Triers,</HI> retired back to the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Who failed him.</NOTE> <HI>Rhine.</HI></P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Baden</HI>'s Conduct through this whole matter was li|able to great Cen&s;ure: The wor&s;t &s;u&s;picion was, that he was corrup|ted by the <HI>French.</HI> Tho&s;e who did not carry their Cen&s;ure &s;o far, attributed his acting as he did to his Pride, and thought he, envy|ing the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> and apprehending that the whole Glory of the Campaign would be a&s;cribed to him, &s;ince he had the &s;tronger Army, cho&s;e rather to defeat the whole De&s;ign, than &s;ee another carry away the chief Honour of any Succe&s;&s;es, that might have happened. The Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> came back in good time to rai&s;e the Siege of the Citadel of <HI>Liege;</HI> and he re|took <HI>Huy</HI> in three days: After that, in conjunction with the <HI>Dutch</HI> Army, he advanced towards the <HI>French</HI> Lines: He for &s;ome days <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of <HI>Marlbo|rough</HI> broke through the <HI>French</HI> Lines.</NOTE> amu&s;ed them with feints; at la&s;t he made the Attack, where he had de&s;igned it, and broke through the Lines, and gave a great Defeat to the Body of the <HI>French</HI> that defended them, with the Lo&s;s only of &s;even Men on his &s;ide; and &s;o without more oppo|&s;ition he came very near <HI>Louvain,</HI> the <HI>Dyle</HI> running between his Camp and the Town: A Deluge of Rain fell that Night, and &s;welled the <HI>Dyle</HI> &s;o, that it was not po&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s it. This gave the <HI>French</HI> time to recover them&s;elves out of the fir&s;t Con&s;ter|nation, that the Advantages he had gained put them in: After a few days, when the pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Dyle</HI> was practicable, the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> gave orders for it: But the <HI>French</HI> were po&s;ted with &s;o much advantage on the other &s;ide, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ge|nerals per&s;uaded the Deputies of the <HI>States,</HI> that they mu&s;t run <NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Dutch</HI> would not venture a Battel.</NOTE> a great ri&s;que, if they &s;hould venture to force the Pa&s;&s;age. The Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> was not a little mortified with this, but he bore it calmly, and moved another way. After &s;ome few Motions, another occa&s;ion was offered, which he intended to lay hold on: Orders were given to force the Pa&s;&s;age; but a Motion through a Wood, that was thought nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport that, was not be|lieved practicable: &s;o the Deputies of the <HI>States</HI> were again po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the Danger of the Attempt; and they thought their Affairs were in &s;o good a Condition, that &s;uch a de&s;perate Undertaking, as that &s;eemed to be, was not to be ventured on.</P>
<P>This was very unea&s;y to the Duke, but he was forced to &s;ub|mit to it, tho' very unwillingly: All agreed that the Enterprize was bold and doubtful; &s;ome thought it mu&s;t have &s;ucceeded,
<PB N="416" REF="442">
though with &s;ome Lo&s;s at fir&s;t; and that if it had &s;ucceeded, it might have proved a deci&s;ive Action; others indeed looked on it as too de&s;perate. A great Breach was like to ari&s;e upon this, both in the Army, and among the <HI>States</HI> at the <HI>Hague,</HI> and in the Towns of <HI>Holland,</HI> in <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> in particular; where the Burghers came in a body to the <HI>Stadthou&s;e,</HI> complaining of the Deputies, and that the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> had not fuller Powers.</P>
<P>I can give no judgment in &s;o nice a point, in which Military Men were of very different opinions, &s;ome ju&s;tifying the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> as much as others cen&s;ured him: He &s;hewed great tem|per on this occa&s;ion, and though it gave him a very &s;en&s;ible trouble yet he &s;et him&s;elf to calm all the heat, that was rai&s;ed upon it. The Campaign in <HI>Flanders</HI> produced nothing after this, but fruitle&s;s Marches, while our Troops were &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in the Enemy's Country, 'till the time came of going into Winter-Quarters. Prince <HI>Lewis</HI>'s Backwardne&s;s, and the Caution of the Deputies of the <HI>States,</HI> made this Campaign le&s;s Glorious than was expected; for I never knew the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> go out &s;o full of hopes, as in the beginning of it: But things had not an&s;wered his expectation.</P>
<P>This Summer the Emperor <HI>Leopold</HI> died: He was the mo&s;t <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Em|peror's Death and Character.</NOTE> knowing and the mo&s;t virtuous Prince of his Communion; only he wanted the Judgment that was nece&s;&s;ary for conducting great Affairs, in &s;uch Critical Times: He was almo&s;t always betrayed, and yet he was &s;o firm to tho&s;e, who had the Addre&s;s to in&s;inuate them&s;elves into his good Opinion and Confidence, that it was not po&s;&s;ible to let him &s;ee tho&s;e Mi&s;carriages, that ruined his Af|fairs &s;o often, and brought them &s;ometimes near the la&s;t Extre|mities: Of the&s;e every body el&s;e &s;eemed more &s;en&s;ible than he him&s;elf. He was devout and &s;trict in his Religion, and was &s;o implicit in his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to tho&s;e Prie&s;ts, who had credit with him, the Je&s;uits in particular, that he owed all his Troubles to their Coun&s;els. The Per&s;ecution they began in <HI>Hungary</HI> rai&s;ed one great War; which gave the <HI>Turks</HI> occa&s;ion to be&s;iege <HI>Vienna,</HI> by which he was almo&s;t entirely &s;wallowed up: This danger did not produce more Caution; after the Peace of <HI>Carlowitz,</HI> there was &s;o much Violence and Oppre&s;&s;ion in the Government of <HI>Hun|gary,</HI> both of Papi&s;ts and Prote&s;tants, that this rai&s;ed a &s;econd War there, which, in conjunction with the Revolt of the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> brought him a &s;econd time very near utter Ruin: Yet he could never be prevailed on, either to puni&s;h, or &s;o much as to &s;u&s;pect tho&s;e, who had &s;o fatally entangled his Affairs; that without Foreign Aid nothing could have extricated them. He was naturally merciful to a fault, for even the Puni&s;hment of
<PB N="417" REF="443">
Criminals was unea&s;y to him: Yet all the Cruelty in the Per&s;e|cution of Hereticks &s;eemed to rai&s;e no relentings in him. It could not but be ob&s;erved by all Prote&s;tants, how much the ill influence of the Popi&s;h Religion appeared in him, who was one of the milde&s;t and mo&s;t virtuous Princes of the Age, &s;ince Cruelty in the Matters of Religion had a full cour&s;e under him, though it was as contrary to his natural Temper, as it was to his Intere&s;ts, and proved oftener than once almo&s;t fatal to all his Affairs. His Son <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> elected King of the <HI>Romans,</HI> &s;ucceeded him both in his Hereditary and Elective Dignities: It was given out, that he would apply him&s;elf much to Bu&s;ine&s;s, and would avoid tho&s;e Rocks on which his Father had &s;truck, and almo&s;t &s;plit; and correct tho&s;e Errors to which his Father's ea&s;ine&s;s had expo&s;ed him: He promi&s;ed to tho&s;e Mini&s;ters, that the Queen and the States had in his Court, that he would offer all rea&s;onable Terms to the <HI>Hun|garians:</HI> And he con&s;ented to their &s;etting a Treaty on foot, in which they were to be the Mediators, and become the Guarantees for the ob&s;ervance of &s;uch Articles, as &s;hould be agreed on; and he gave great hopes, that he would not continue in that &s;ubjec|tion to the Prie&s;ts, to which his Father had been captivated.</P>
<P>He de&s;ired to confer with the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> and to concert all Affairs with him: The Queen con&s;i&s;ted to this, and the Duke went to <HI>Vienna,</HI> where he was treated with great free|dom and confidence, and he had all a&s;&s;urances given him, that could be given in words: He found, that the Emperor was high|ly di&s;&s;atisfied with the Prince of <HI>Baden,</HI> but he had &s;uch credit in the Empire, e&s;pecially with the Circles of <HI>Suabia</HI> and <HI>Franco|nia,</HI> that it was nece&s;&s;ary to bear with that, which could not be helped. The Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> returned thro' the Hereditary Dominions to <HI>Berlin,</HI> where he had learned &s;o perfectly to ac|commodate him&s;elf to that King's Temper, that he &s;ucceeded in every thing he propo&s;ed, and renewed all Treaties for one year longer. He came from thence to the Court of <HI>Hanover,</HI> and there he gave them full A&s;&s;urances of the Queen's adhering firmly to their Intere&s;ts, in maintaining the Succe&s;&s;ion to the Crown in their Family, with which the Elector was fully &s;atisfied: But it appeared that the Electore&s;s had a mind, to be invited over to <HI>England.</HI> From thence he came back to <HI>Holland,</HI> and it was near the end of the year before he came over to <HI>England.</HI> Thus I have ca&s;t all that relates to him, in one continued &s;eries, though it ran out into a Cour&s;e of many Months.</P>
<P>The <HI>German</HI> Army was not brought together before <HI>Augu&s;t:</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in <HI>Germany.</HI></NOTE> It was a very brave one, yet it did not much; the <HI>French</HI> gave way, and retired before them: <HI>Haguenaw</HI> and &s;ome other
<PB N="418" REF="444">
Places were left by the <HI>French,</HI> and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Imperiali&s;ts: a Blockade was laid to Fort <HI>Lewis.</HI> But nothing was done by that noble Army, equal either to their Numbers and Strength, or to the Reputation that the Prince of <HI>Baden</HI> had formerly acquired. This was contrary to the general expectation; for it was thought, that being at the head of &s;o great an Army, he would have &s;tudied to have &s;ignalized him&s;elf, if it had been but to rival the Glory, that the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> and Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> had acquired.</P>
<P>Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> had a hard time in <HI>Italy:</HI> He had a weak Army, <NOTE PLACE="marg">And in <HI>Italy.</HI></NOTE> and it was both ill-provided and ill-paid; he was long &s;hut up within the Country of <HI>Bergamo;</HI> at la&s;t he broke through to <HI>Cu|&s;ano;</HI> where there was a very hot Action between him and the Duke of <HI>Vendo&s;me;</HI> both Sides pretended they had the Victory, yet the Duke of <HI>Vendo&s;me</HI> repa&s;&s;ed the River, and the Im|periali&s;ts kept the Field of Battel. The <HI>French</HI> threatned <HI>Turin</HI> with a Siege, but they began with <HI>Chivas,</HI> which held out &s;ome Months, and was at la&s;t abandoned; the Duke of <HI>Feuillade</HI> com|manded the Army near <HI>Turin,</HI> and &s;eemed to di&s;po&s;e every thing in order to a Siege; but the De&s;ign was turned upon <HI>Nice,</HI> tho' late in the year: They made a brave re&s;i&s;tance for many weeks; in <HI>December</HI> they were forced to capitulate, and the Place was demoli&s;hed by the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>The Firmne&s;s, that the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> expre&s;&s;ed in all the&s;e Lo&s;&s;es, was the wonder of all <HI>Europe;</HI> he had now but a &s;mall Army of 8000 Foot and 4000 Hor&s;e, and had &s;carce Terri|tory enough to &s;upport the&s;e; he had no con&s;iderable Places le&s;t him but <HI>Turin</HI> and <HI>Coni:</HI> But he &s;eemed re&s;olved to be driven out of all, rather than to abandon the Alliance. His Dutche&s;s with all the Clergy, and indeed all his Subjects, prayed him to &s;ubmit to the nece&s;&s;ity of his Affairs; nothing could &s;hake him; he admitted none of his Bi&s;hops nor Clergy into his Councils, and as his Envoy the Count <HI>Briancon</HI> told me, he had no certain Fa|ther-Confe&s;&s;or, but &s;ent &s;ometimes to the <HI>Dominicans,</HI> and &s;ome|times to the <HI>Franci&s;cans</HI> for a Prie&s;t, when he intended to go to Confe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I turn next to <HI>Spain,</HI> which was this year a Scene of mo&s;t <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in <HI>Spain.</HI></NOTE> important Tran&s;actions: The fir&s;t Campaign in <HI>Portugal</HI> be|fore the hot Sea&s;on, produced nothing: The &s;econd Campaign &s;eemed to promi&s;e &s;omewhat, but the Conduct was &s;o feeble, that though the Earl of <HI>Galloway</HI> did all that was po&s;&s;ible, to put things in a good po&s;ture, yet he &s;aw a di&s;po&s;ition in the Mi|ni&s;ters, and in their whole Management, that made him often de&s;pair, and wi&s;h him&s;elf out of the Service. <HI>Fagel,</HI> that com|manded the <HI>Dutch</HI> Forces, acted in every thing in oppo&s;ition to
<PB N="419" REF="445">
him, and it was vi&s;ible that the Mini&s;ters did &s;ecretly encourage that, by which they excu&s;ed them&s;elves.</P>
<P>King <HI>Charles</HI> was &s;o di&s;gu&s;ted with the&s;e Proceedings, that he <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Fleet and Army &s;ent to <HI>Spain.</HI></NOTE> was become quite weary of &s;taying in <HI>Portugal:</HI> So when the Fleet of the Allies came to <HI>Lisbon</HI> with an Army on board, of above 5000 Men, commanded by the Earl of <HI>Peterborough,</HI> he re&s;olved to go aboard, and to try his Fortune with them. The Almirante of <HI>Ga&s;tile</HI> died about that time; &s;ome thought that was a great Lo&s;s; though others did not &s;et &s;o high a value upon him, nor on any of the Intrigues that were among the Grandees at <HI>Madrid:</HI> They were indeed offended with &s;everal &s;mall matters in King <HI>Philip</HI>'s Conduct, and with the A&s;cendant, that the <HI>French</HI> had in all their Councils; for they &s;aw every thing was directed by Orders &s;ent from <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> and that their King was really but a Viceroy: They were al&s;o highly provoked by &s;ome Innovations made in the Ceremonial, which they valued above more important Matters; many &s;eemed di&s;gu&s;ted at that Conduct, and withdrew from the Court. The Marque&s;s of <HI>Leganes</HI> was con&s;idered, as mo&s;t active in infu&s;ing Jealou&s;ies and a Di&s;like of the Govern|ment into the other Grandees, &s;o he was &s;eized on, and &s;ent Pri|&s;oner to <HI>Navarre;</HI> the Grandees, in all their Conduct, &s;hewed more of a haughty Sullenne&s;s in maintaining their own Privileges, than of a generous Re&s;olution to free their Country from the Sla|very, under which it was fallen; they &s;eemed neither to have Heads capable of laying any &s;olid De&s;igns, for &s;haking off the yoke, nor Hearts brave enough to undertake it.</P>
<P>Our Fleet &s;ailed from <HI>Lisbon</HI> with King <HI>Charles;</HI> they &s;topt at <HI>Gibraltar;</HI> and carried along with them the Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e,</HI> who had been &s;o long Governour of <HI>Barcelona,</HI> that he knew both the Tempers, and the Strength, and Importance of the Place. The fir&s;t De&s;ign of this Expedition was concerted with the Duke of <HI>Savoy;</HI> and the Forces they had on board, were either to join him, or to make an attempt on <HI>Naples</HI> or <HI>Sicily,</HI> as &s;hould be found mo&s;t advi&s;able: There were Agents employed in different Parts of <HI>Spain,</HI> to give an account of the di&s;po&s;ition People were in, and of what &s;eemed mo&s;t practicable. A Body of Men ro&s;e in <HI>Catalonia</HI> about <HI>Vick:</HI> upon the knowledge King <HI>Charles</HI> had of this, and upon other Adverti&s;ements that were &s;ent to our Court, of the di&s;po&s;itions of tho&s;e of that Principality, the Orders which King <HI>Charles</HI> de&s;ired were &s;ent; and brought by a Runner, that was di&s;|patched from the Queen to the Fleet: So the Fleet &s;teered to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Catalonia,</HI> to try what could be done there. The Earl of <HI>Peterborough,</HI> who had &s;et his heart on <HI>Italy,</HI> and on Prince
<PB N="420" REF="446">
<HI>Eugene,</HI> was not a little di&s;plea&s;ed with this, as appeared in a long Letter from him, which the Lord-Trea&s;urer &s;hewed me.</P>
<P>They landed not far from <HI>Barcelona,</HI> and were joined with many <HI>Miquelets</HI> and others of the Country; the&s;e were good at <NOTE PLACE="marg">They landed near <HI>Bar|celona.</HI></NOTE> plundering, but could not &s;ubmit to a regular Di&s;cipline, nor were they willing to expo&s;e them&s;elves to dangerous Services. <HI>Bar|celona</HI> had a Garri&s;on of 5000 Men in it; the&s;e were commanded by Officers, who were entirely in the Intere&s;ts of King <HI>Philip;</HI> it &s;eemed a very unrea&s;onable thing to undertake the Siege of &s;uch a Place, with &s;o &s;mall a Force; they could not depend on the raw and undi&s;ciplined Multitudes, that came in to join them, who if things &s;ucceeded not in their hands, would &s;oon abandon them, or perhaps &s;tudy to merit a pardon, by cutting their throats. A Council of War was called, to con&s;ult on what could be pro|po&s;ed and done; <HI>Stanhope,</HI> who was one of them, told me, that both <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> were all of opinion, that the Siege could not be undertaken, with &s;o &s;mall a Force; tho&s;e within being as &s;trong as they were, nor did they &s;ee any thing el&s;e worth the at|tempting: They therefore thought that no time was to be lo&s;t, but that they were all to go again on board, and to con&s;ider what Cour&s;e was next to be taken, before the Sea&s;on were &s;pent, when the Fleet would be obliged to return back again, and if they could not fix them&s;elves any where before that time, they mu&s;t &s;ail back with the Fleet. The Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e</HI> only was of opinion, that they ought to &s;it down before <HI>Barcelona;</HI> he &s;aid, he had &s;ecret intelligence of the good affections of many in the Town, who were well-known to him, and on whom he relied, and he undertook to an&s;wer for their Succe&s;s: This could not &s;a|tisfy tho&s;e who knew nothing of his Secrets, and &s;o could only judge of things by what appeared to them.</P>
<P>The Debate la&s;ted &s;ome hours: In conclu&s;ion, the King him|&s;elf &s;poke near half an hour; he re&s;umed the whole Debate, he <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King pre$&s;ed the $word$.</NOTE> an&s;wered all the Objections that were made again&s;t the Siege; and treated every one of tho&s;e who had made them, as he an|&s;wered them, with particular Civilities; he &s;upported the truth of what the Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e</HI> had a&s;&s;erted, as being known to him|&s;elf; he &s;aid, in the State in which his Affairs then &s;tood, nothing could be propo&s;ed that had not great difficulties in it, all was doubtful, and much mu&s;t be put to hazard; but this &s;eemed le&s;s dangerous than any other thing that was propo&s;ed: Many of his Subjects had come and declared for him, to the hazard of their Lives; it became him therefore to let them &s;ee, that he would run the &s;ame hazard with them; he de&s;ired that they would &s;tay &s;o long with him, 'till &s;uch attempts &s;hould be made, that all the
<PB N="421" REF="447">
World might be convinced, that nothing could be done, and he hoped that till that appeared, they would not leave him; he ad|ded, that if their Orders did oblige them to leave him, yet he could not leave his own Subjects: upon this they re&s;olved to &s;it down before <HI>Barcelona.</HI> They were all amazed to &s;ee &s;o young a Prince, &s;o little practi&s;ed in Bu&s;ine&s;s, argue in &s;o nice a point, with &s;o much force; and conclude with &s;uch he|roical Re&s;olutions. This proved happy in many Re&s;pects; It came to be known afterwards, that the <HI>Catalans</HI> and <HI>Miquelets,</HI> who had joined them, hearing that they were re&s;olved to aban|don them, and go back to their Ships, had re&s;olved, either out of re&s;entment, or that they might merit their pardon, to murder as many of them as they could. When this &s;mall Army &s;ate down before <HI>Barcelona,</HI> they found they were too weak to be&s;iege it; they could &s;carce mount their Cannon: When they came to examine their Stores, they found them very defective; and far &s;hort of the Quantities that by their Li&s;ts they expected to find; whether this flowed from Treachery or Carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, I will not determine; there is much of both in all our Offices. It &s;oon appeared that the Intelligence was true, concerning the In|clinations of tho&s;e in the Town, their Affections were entire for King <HI>Charles:</HI> but they were over-awed by the Garri&s;on, and by <HI>Vela&s;co,</HI> who as well as the Duke of <HI>Popoli,</HI> who had the chief command, was devoted to the Intere&s;ts of King <HI>Philip.</HI> De&s;erters came daily from the Town and brought them Intelli|gence: the mo&s;t con&s;iderable thing was, that Fort <HI>Montjuy</HI> was <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fort <HI>Mont|juy</HI> attacked</NOTE> very ill guarded, it being thought above their Strength to make an attempt on it; &s;o it was concluded that all the hopes of reducing <HI>Barcelona</HI> lay in the Succe&s;s of their De&s;ign on that Fort. Two Bodies were ordered to march &s;ecretly that night, and to move to|wards the other &s;ide of <HI>Barcelona,</HI> that the true De&s;ign might not be &s;u&s;pected, for all the hopes of Succe&s;s lay in the &s;ecrecy of the March. The fir&s;t Body con&s;i&s;ted of 800, and both the Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Peterborough</HI> led them: The other Body con&s;i&s;ted of 600, who were to follow the&s;e at &s;ome di&s;tance; and were not to come above half way up the Hill, till further Order: <HI>Stanhope</HI> led this Body, from whom I had this Account. They drew up with them &s;ome &s;mall Field-pieces and Mortars; they had taken a great compa&s;s, and had marched all night, and were much fatigued by the time that they had gained the Top of the Hill; 300 of them, being commanded to another &s;ide of the Fort, were &s;eparated from the re&s;t, and mi&s;taking their way, fell into the hands of a Body of Men, &s;ent up from the Town to reinforce the Garri&s;on in the
<PB N="422" REF="448">
Fort; before they were &s;eparated, the whole Body had attacked the Out-works, and carried them; but while the Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e</HI> was leading on his Men he received a Shot in his Body, upon which he fell; yet he would not be carried off, but continued too long in the place giving Orders, and died in a few hours, much and ju&s;tly lamented. The Governour of the Fort, &s;eeing a &s;mall Body in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Out-works, re&s;olved to &s;ally out upon them, and drew up 400 Men in order to it; the&s;e would &s;oon have ma&s;ter'd a &s;mall and wearied Body, di&s;hearten'd by &s;o great a lo&s;s; &s;o that if he had followed his re&s;olution all was lo&s;t, for all that <HI>Stanhope</HI> could have done, was, to receive, and bring off &s;uch as could get to him; but one of tho&s;e newly taken, happening to cry out, <HI>O poor Prince of</HI> He&s;&s;e, the Governour hearing this, called for him, and examined him, and when he learned that both the Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Peterborough</HI> were with that Body, he concluded that the whole Army was certainly coming up after them; and reflecting on that, he thought it was not fit for him to expo&s;e his Men, &s;ince he be|lieved the Body they were to attack would be &s;oon much &s;upe|riour to him; &s;o he re&s;olved not to ri&s;que a Sally, but to keep within and maintain the Fort again&s;t them. Thus the Earl of <HI>Peterborough</HI> continued quiet in the Out-works, and being rein|forced with more Men, he attacked the Fort, but with no great hopes of &s;ucceeding: he threw a few Bombs into it, one of the&s;e fell happily into the Magazine of Powder, and blew it up: By this the Governour and &s;ome of the be&s;t Officers were killed, which &s;truck the re&s;t with &s;uch a Con&s;ternation, that they de|livered up the Place. This Succe&s;s gave them great hopes, the <NOTE PLACE="marg">And taken.</NOTE> Town lying ju&s;t under the Hill, which the Fort &s;tood on: Upon this the Party in <HI>Barcelona,</HI> that was well affected to K. <HI>Charles,</HI> began to take heart, and to &s;hew them&s;elves: And after a few days Siege, another happy Bomb fell with &s;o good an effect, that the Garri&s;on was forced to capitulate.</P>
<P>King <HI>Charles</HI> was received into <HI>Barcelona,</HI> with great expre&s;|&s;ions of joy: In the fir&s;t tran&s;port, they &s;eemed re&s;olved to break through the Articles granted to the Garri&s;on, and to make &s;acri|fices of the chief Officers at lea&s;t. Upon that the Earl of <HI>Peter|borough,</HI> with <HI>Stanhope</HI> and other Officers, rode about the Streets, <NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> to &s;top this fury, and to prevail with the People to maintain their Articles religiou&s;ly; and in doing this, <HI>Stanhope</HI> &s;aid to me, they ran a greater hazard, from the &s;hooting and fire, that was flying about in that di&s;order, than they had done during the whole Siege: They at la&s;t quieted the People, and the Articles of Ca|pitulation were punctually ob&s;erved. Upon this unexpected Suc|ce&s;s,
<PB N="423" REF="449">
the whole Principality of <HI>Catalonia</HI> declared for King <HI>Charles:</HI> I will not pro&s;ecute this Relation &s;o minutely in other Parts of it, having &s;et down &s;o particularly, that which I had from &s;o good a Hand, chiefly to &s;et forth the &s;ignal Steps of Providence, that did appear in this matter.</P>
<P>Soon after, our Fleet &s;ailed back to <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Stanhope</HI> was &s;ent over in it, to give a full Relation of this great Tran&s;action $word$ By him King <HI>Charles</HI> wrote to the Queen a long and clear ac|count of all his Affairs; full of great Acknowledgements of her <NOTE PLACE="marg">K. <HI>Char$span$</HI>'s Letters.</NOTE> a&s;&s;i&s;tance, with a high Commendation of all Her Subjects, more particularly of the Earl of <HI>Peterborough:</HI> The Queen was plea&s;ed to &s;hew me the Letter; it was all writ in his own hand, and the <HI>French</HI> of it was &s;o little correct, that it was not like what a Se|cretary would have drawn for him: &s;o from that I concluded he penned it him&s;elf. The Lord-Trea&s;urer had likewi&s;e another long Letter from him, which he &s;hewed me: It was all in his own hand: One Correction &s;eemed to make it evident, that He him&s;elf compo&s;ed it. He wrote towards the end of the Letter, that he mu&s;t depend on <HI>his Protection;</HI> upon reflection, that word &s;eemed not fit for him to u&s;e to a Subject, &s;o it was da&s;hed out, but the Letters were &s;till plain, and in&s;tead of it <HI>Application</HI> was writ over head: The&s;e Letters gave a great Idea of &s;o young and unexperienced a Prince, who was able to write with &s;o much Clearne&s;s, Judgment, and Force. By all that is re|ported of the Prince of <HI>Lichten&s;tein,</HI> that King could not receive any great A&s;&s;i&s;tance from him: He was &s;poken of, as a Man of a low Genius, who thought of nothing but the ways of enriching him&s;elf, even at the hazard of ruining his Ma&s;ter's Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Our Affairs at Sea were more pro&s;perous this year, than they <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs at Sea.</NOTE> had been formerly: In the beginning of the Sea&s;on our Cruizers took &s;o many of the <HI>French</HI> Privateers, that we had &s;ome thou&s;ands of their Seamen in our hands: We kept &s;uch a Squa|dron before <HI>Bre&s;t,</HI> that the <HI>French</HI> Fleet did not think &s;it to venture out, and their <HI>Toulon</HI> Squadron had &s;uffered &s;o much in the Action of the former years, that they either could not, or would not venture out: By this means our Navigation was &s;afe, and our Trade was pro&s;perous.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Campaign in <HI>Portugal</HI> ended wor&s;e than the fir&s;t: <HI>Badajos</HI> was be&s;ieged, and the Earl of <HI>Gallway</HI> hoped he &s;hould have been quickly Ma&s;ter of it; but his hopes were not well|grounded, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Siege of <HI>$word$</HI> rai&s;ed</NOTE> for the Siege was rai&s;ed: In one Action the Earl of <HI>Gallway</HI>'s Arm was broke by a Cannon-ball: It was cut off, and for &s;ome days his Life was in great danger; the Mi&s;carriage of the De&s;ign heightening the Fever that followed his Wound, by
<PB N="424" REF="450">
vexation that it gave him. But now upon the news from <HI>Cata|lonia,</HI> the Councils of <HI>Portugal</HI> were quite changed: They had a better pro&s;pect than formerly, of the Reduction of <HI>Spain:</HI> The <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Coun|cils of <HI>Por|tugal.</HI></NOTE> War was now divided, which lay wholly upon them before: And the <HI>French</HI> Party in that Court had no more the old pretence, to excu&s;e their Councils by, which was, that it was not fit for them to engage them&s;elves too deep in that War, nor to provoke the <HI>Spaniards</HI> too much, and &s;o expo&s;e them&s;elves to Revenges, if the Allies &s;hould de&s;pair and grow weary of the War, and recall their Troops and Fleets. But now that they &s;aw the War carried on &s;o far, in the remote&s;t corner of <HI>Spain,</HI> which mu&s;t give a great Diver&s;ion to King <HI>Philip</HI>'s Forces, it &s;eemed a much &s;afer, as well as it was an ea&s;ier thing to carry on the War, with more Vigour for the future. Upon this all po&s;&s;ible A&s;&s;urances were given the Earl of <HI>Gallway,</HI> that things &s;hould be conducted hereafter fully to his content. So that by two of his Di&s;patches, which the Lord-Trea&s;urer &s;hewed me, it appeared that he was then fully con|vinced of the Sincerity of their Intentions, of which he was in great doubt, or rather de&s;pairing formerly.</P>
<P>In <HI>Hungary</HI> matters went on very doubtfully: <HI>Tran&s;ylvania</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in <HI>Hungary.</HI></NOTE> was almo&s;t entirely reduced; <HI>Ragotzi</HI> had great Misfortunes there, as the Court of <HI>Vienna</HI> publi&s;hed the Progre&s;s of the new Empe|ror's Arms, but this was not to be much depended on: They could not conceal on the other hand the great Ravages, that the Malecontents made in other places: So that <HI>Hungary</HI> continued to be a Scene of Confu&s;ion and Plunder.</P>
<P><HI>Poland</HI> was no better: King <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI>'s Party continued firm <NOTE PLACE="marg">And in <HI>Po|land.</HI></NOTE> to him, tho' his long &s;tay in <HI>Saxony,</HI> gave credit to a Report &s;pread about, that he was re&s;olved to abandon that Kingdom, and to return to it no more: This Summer pa&s;t over in Motions, and Actions of no great con&s;equence: what was gained in one place, was lo&s;t in another. <HI>Stani&s;laus</HI> got him&s;elf to be crowned: The old Cardinal, tho' &s;ummoned to <HI>Rome,</HI> would not go thither: He &s;uffered him&s;elf to be forced to own <HI>Sta|ni&s;laus,</HI> but died before his Coronation, and that Ceremony was performed by the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Cujavia:</HI> The <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> made as great ravages in <HI>Lithuania,</HI> as they had done formerly in <HI>Livo|nia:</HI> The King of <HI>Sweden</HI> was in perpetual motion: But tho' he endeavoured it much, he could not bring things to a deci&s;ive action. In the beginning of Winter, King <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> with two Per&s;ons only, broke thro' <HI>Poland</HI> in di&s;gui&s;e, and got to the <HI>Mu&s;|covite</HI> Army, which was put under his Command. The Cam|paign went on all the Winter-&s;ea&s;on, which, con&s;idering the ex|tream Cold in tho&s;e Parts, was thought a thing impracticable
<PB N="425" REF="451">
before. In the Spring after, <HI>Rein&s;child</HI> a <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> General, fell upon the <HI>Saxon</HI> Army, that was far &s;uperiour to his in number: He had not above 10000 Men, and the <HI>Saxons</HI> were about 18000: He gave them a total Defeat, killed about 7000, and took 8000 Pri&s;oners, and their Camp, Baggage, and Artillery: Numbers upon &s;uch Occa&s;ions are often &s;welled, but it is certain this was an entire Victory: The <HI>Swedes</HI> gave it out, that they had not lo&s;t a thou&s;and Men in the Action; and yet even this great advantage was not like to put an end to the War, nor to the Di&s;tractions, into which that mi&s;erable Kingdom was ca&s;t. In it the World &s;aw the Mi&s;chiefs of an Elective Government, e&s;pe|cially when the Electors have lo&s;t their Virtue, and &s;et them&s;elves to &s;ale. The King of <HI>Sweden</HI> continued in an ob&s;tinate Aver&s;ion to all Terms of Peace: His Temper, his Courage, and his mili|tary Conduct were much commended; only all &s;aid he grew too &s;avage, and was &s;o po&s;itive and peremptory in his Re&s;olutions, that no Applications could &s;often him: He would &s;carce admit them to be made: He was &s;aid to be devout almo&s;t to Enthu|&s;ia&s;m, and he was &s;everely engaged in the <HI>Lutheran</HI> Rigidity, almo&s;t equally again&s;t Papi&s;ts and Calvini&s;ts: Only his Education was &s;o much neglected, that he had not an equal mea&s;ure of Knowledge, to direct his Zeal.</P>
<P>This is &s;uch a general View of the State of <HI>Europe</HI> this Sum|mer, as may &s;erve to &s;hew how things went on in every Part of it. I now return to <HI>England.</HI> The Election of the Members of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parlia|ment cho&s;en in <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> Hou&s;e of Commons was managed with Zeal and Indu&s;try on both &s;ides: The Clergy took great pains to infu&s;e, into all Peo|ple, tragical Apprehen&s;ions of the Danger the Church was in: The Univer&s;ities were inflamed with this, and they took all means to &s;pread it over the Nation, with much Vehemence: The Danger the Church of <HI>England</HI> was in, grew to be as the Word given in an Army; Men were known as they an&s;wered it: None carried this higher than the Jacobites, tho' they had made a Schi&s;m in the Church: At la&s;t, even the Papi&s;ts, both at home and abroad, &s;eemed to be di&s;turbed, with the Fears that the Danger our Church was in, put them under: and this was &s;up|ported by the <HI>Paris</HI> Gazette, tho' the Party &s;eemed concerned and a&s;hamed of that. Books were writ and di&s;per&s;ed over the Nation with great Indu&s;try, to po&s;&s;e&s;s all People with the Ap|prehen&s;ions that the Church was to be given up, that the Bi|&s;hops were betraying it, and that the Court would &s;ell it to the Di&s;&s;enters. They al&s;o hoped, that this Campaign, proving le&s;s pro&s;perous than had been expected, might put the Nation into ill humour, which might furni&s;h them with &s;ome Advantages. In
<PB N="426" REF="452">
oppo&s;ition to all this, the Court acted with &s;uch caution and coldne&s;s, that the Whigs had very little Strength given them by the Mini&s;ters, in managing Elections: They &s;eemed rather to look on, as indifferent Spectators, but the Whigs exerted them|&s;elves with great Activity and Zeal. The Di&s;&s;enters, who had been formerly much divided, were now united, entirely in the Intere&s;ts of the Government, and joined with the Whigs every where.</P>
<P>When the Elections were all over, the Court took more heart: for it appeared, that they were &s;ure of a great Majority, and the Lord <HI>Godolphin</HI> declared him&s;elf more openly, than he had done formerly, in favour of the Whigs: The fir&s;t in&s;tance given of this, was the di&s;mi&s;&s;ing of <HI>Wright,</HI> who had continued &s;o long Lord-Keeper, that he was fallen under a high degree of Con|tempt with all &s;ides; even the Tories, tho' he was wholly theirs, de&s;pi&s;ing him: He was &s;ordidly covetous, and did not at all live &s;uitably to that High Po&s;t: He became extream rich, yet I ne|ver heard him charged with Bribery in his Court, but there was a foul Rumour, with relation to the Livings of the Crown, that were given by the Great Seal, as if they were &s;et to &s;ale, by the Officers under him.</P>
<P>The Seals being &s;ent for, they were given to <HI>Cowper,</HI> a Gentle|man of a good Family, of excellent Parts and of an engaging <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cowper</HI> Lord-Keeper.</NOTE> Deportment, very eminent in his Profe&s;&s;ion; and who had for many years been con&s;idered, as the Man who &s;poke the be&s;t of any in the Hou&s;e of Commons: He was a very acceptable Man to the Whig Party: They had been much di&s;gu&s;ted with the Lord-Trea&s;urer, for the Coldne&s;s he expre&s;&s;ed, as if he would have maintained a Neutrality between the two Parties; tho' the one &s;upported him, while the other de&s;igned to ruin him: But this Step went a great way towards the reconciling the Whigs to him.</P>
<P>A Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament met this Summer in <HI>Scotland:</HI> There was a Change made in the Mini&s;try there: Tho&s;e who were em|ployed in the former Se&s;&s;ion, could not undertake to carry a Ma|jority: So all the Duke of <HI>Queensbury</HI>'s Friends were again brought into Employment. The Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI>'s In&s;tructions were, that he &s;hould endeavour to procure an Act, &s;ettling the Succe&s;&s;ion as it was in <HI>England,</HI> or to &s;et on foot a Treaty for the Union of the two Kingdoms: When he came to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and laid his In&s;tructions before the re&s;t of the Mini&s;ters there; the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Anandale</HI> pre&s;&s;ed, that they &s;hould fir&s;t try that, which was fir&s;t named in the In&s;tructions, and he &s;eemed confident, that if all who were in Imployments would concur in it, they &s;hould
<PB N="427" REF="453">
be able to carry it. Tho&s;e of another mind, who were in their hearts for the Pretended Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> put this by with great Zeal: They &s;aid they mu&s;t not begin with that, which would meet with great Oppo&s;ition, and be perhaps rejected: That would beget &s;uch an Union of Parties, that if they mi&s;carried in the one, they would not be able to carry the other; therefore they thought, that the fir&s;t Propo&s;ition &s;hould be for the Union: that was popular, and &s;eemed to be a remote thing; &s;o there would be no great Oppo&s;ition made to a general Act about it. Tho&s;e who intended &s;till to oppo&s;e it, would reckon they would find matter enough in the Particulars, to rai&s;e a great Oppo&s;ition, and &s;o to defeat it. This cour&s;e was agreed on, a which the Mar|que&s;s of <HI>Anandale</HI> was &s;o highly offended, that he concurred no <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Act for a Treaty of Union pa&s;t.</NOTE> more in the Councils of tho&s;e, who gave the other Advice. Some did &s;incerely de&s;ire the Union, as that which would render the whole I&s;land happy: others were in their Hearts again&s;t it; they thought it was a plau&s;ible &s;tep, which they believed would run, by a long Treaty, into a cour&s;e of &s;ome years; that during that time, they would be continued in their Imployments, and they &s;eemed to think it was impo&s;&s;ible &s;o to adju&s;t all Matters, as to frame &s;uch a Treaty, as would pa&s;s in the Parliaments of both Kingdoms. The Jacobites concurred all heartily in this: It kept the &s;ettling the Succe&s;&s;ion at a di&s;tance, and very few looked on the Motion for the Union, as any thing but a Pretence, to keep Mat|ters yet longer in &s;u&s;pence: So this being propo&s;ed in Parliament, it was &s;oon and readily agreed to, with little or no Oppo&s;ition. But that being over, Complaints were made of the Acts pa&s;&s;ed, in the Parliament of <HI>England:</HI> which carried &s;uch an appearance of Threatning, that many thought it became them not to enter on a Treaty, till the&s;e &s;hould be repealed. It was carried, but not without difficulty, that no Clau&s;e relating to that &s;hould be in the Act, that empowered the Queen to name the Commi&s;&s;ioners; but that an Addre&s;s &s;hould be made to the Queen, praying her that no Proceedings &s;hould be made in the Treaty, till the Act, that declared the <HI>Scotch</HI> Aliens by &s;uch a Day, &s;hould be re|pealed: They al&s;o voted, that none of that Nation &s;hould enter upon any &s;uch Treaty, till that were fir&s;t done. This was po|pular, and no Oppo&s;ition was made to it: But tho&s;e who had ill Intentions, hoped that all would be defeated by it. The Se&s;&s;ion run out into a great length, and in the Harve&s;t-time, which put the Country to a great Charge.</P>
<P>In <HI>Ireland,</HI> the new Heat among the Prote&s;tants there, rai&s;ed <NOTE PLACE="marg">The State of <HI>Ireland.</HI></NOTE> in the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI>'s time, and connived at, if not encouraged by the Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> went on &s;till: A Body of hot Clergy|men
<PB N="428" REF="454">
&s;ent from <HI>England,</HI> began to form Meetings in <HI>Dublin,</HI> and to have Emi&s;&s;aries and a Corre&s;pondence over <HI>Ireland,</HI> on de&s;ign to rai&s;e the &s;ame Fury in the Clergy of that Kingdom again&s;t the Di&s;&s;enters, that they had rai&s;ed here in <HI>England:</HI> Whether this was only the effect of an unthinking and ill-governed heat a|mong them, or if it was &s;et on by foreign Practices, was not yet vi&s;ible. It did certainly &s;erve their ends, &s;o that it was not to be doubted, that they were not wanting in their Endeavours to keep it up, and to promote it, whether they were the original Con|trivers of it or not; for indeed hot Men, not practi&s;ed in Affairs, are apt enough of their own accord, to run into wild and unrea|&s;onable Extravagances.</P>
<P>The Parliament of <HI>England</HI> met in the end of <HI>October:</HI> The <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parlia|ment in <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> fir&s;t Struggle was about the choice of a Speaker, by which a Judgment was to be made of the Temper and Inclinations of the Members. The Court declared for Mr. <HI>Smith:</HI> He was a Man of clear Parts, and of a good Expre&s;&s;ion: He was then in no Em|ployment, but he had gone thro' great Po&s;ts in the former Reign, with Reputation and Honour. He had been a Commi&s;&s;ioner of the Trea&s;ury and Chancellor of the Exchequer: He had, from his <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Speaker cho&s;en.</NOTE> fir&s;t &s;etting out into the World, been throughly in the Principles and Intere&s;ts of the Whigs, yet with a due Temper in all per&s;o|nal things, with relation to the Tories: But they all declared a|gain&s;t him for Mr. <HI>Bromley,</HI> a Man of a grave Deportment, and good Morals, but looked on as a violent Tory, and as a great Fa|vourer of Jacobites; which appeared evidently in a Relation he printed of his Travels. No Matter of that &s;ort had ever been car|ried with &s;uch a Heat on both &s;ides, as this was: So that it was ju&s;t to form a Judgment upon it of the Temper of the Hou&s;e, it went for Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> by a Majority of four and forty.</P>
<P>The Queen, after &s;he had confirmed this choice, made a Speech, in which &s;he recommended Union to them, in a very particular man|ner: She complained of the Reports, that were &s;pread by ill-de|&s;igning Men, of the Danger the Church was in, who under the&s;e In&s;inuations covered that, which they dur&s;t not own: She recom|mended the Care of the publick Supplies to the Commons, and &s;poke of the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> in high and very obliging Terms. This produced Addre&s;&s;es from both Hou&s;es, in which they ex|pre&s;&s;ed a Dete&s;tation of tho&s;e Practices, of infu&s;ing into her Sub|jects groundle&s;s Fears, concerning the Church: This went ea&s;ily, for &s;ome kept out of the way, from whom it was expected, that they would afterwards open more copiou&s;ly on the Subject. The Chairmen of the &s;everal Committees of the Hou&s;e of Commons, were Men of whom the Court was well a&s;&s;ured.</P>
<P><PB N="429" REF="455">
The fir&s;t Matter, with which they commonly begin, is to receive Petitions again&s;t the Members returned, &s;o that gave a further di&s;covery of the Inclinations of the Majority: The Corruption of the Nation was grown to &s;uch a height, and there was &s;o much foul practice on all hands, that there was, no doubt, great cau&s;e of complaint. The fir&s;t Election that was judged, was that of <HI>St. Albans,</HI> where the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Marlborough</HI> had a Hou&s;e: She recommended Admiral <HI>Killigrew</HI> to tho&s;e in the Town; which was done all <HI>England</HI> over, by Per&s;ons of Quality, who had any Intere&s;t in the Burghers: yet, tho' much foul practice was proved on the other hand, and there was not the lea&s;t colour of Evidence, to fix any ill practice on her, &s;ome reflected very indecently upon her: <HI>Bromley</HI> compared her to <HI>Alice Piers,</HI> in King <HI>Edward</HI> the Third's time, and &s;aid many other virulent things again&s;t her; for indeed &s;he was looked upon, by the whole Party, as the Per&s;on who had reconciled the Whigs to the Queen, from whom &s;he was naturally very aver&s;e. Mo&s;t of the controverted Elections were carried in favour of the Whigs: In &s;ome few they failed, more by rea&s;on of private Animo&s;ities, than by the Strength of the other &s;ide. The Hou&s;e of Commons came readily in to vote all the Supplies that were asked, and went on to provide proper Funds for them.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t important Debates that were in this Se&s;&s;ion, began in the Hou&s;e of Lords; the Queen being pre&s;ent at them all. The Lord <HI>Haver&s;ham</HI> opened the Motions of the Tory &s;ide: He arraigned the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI>'s Conduct, both on the <HI>Mo|&s;elle</HI> and in <HI>Brabant,</HI> and reflected &s;everely on the <HI>Dutch,</HI> which he carried &s;o far as to &s;ay, that the War co&s;t them nothing; and after he had wandered long in a rambling Di&s;cour&s;e, he came at la&s;t to the Point which was laid, to be the Debate of the Day: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Debates a|bout the next Suc|ce&s;&s;or.</NOTE> He &s;aid we had declared a Succe&s;&s;or to the Crown, who was at a great di&s;tance from us: While the Pretender was much nearer; and <HI>Scotland</HI> was armed and ready to receive him; and &s;eemed re&s;olved not to have the &s;ame Succe&s;&s;or, for whom <HI>England</HI> had declared: The&s;e were threatning Dangers that hung over us, and might be near us. He concluded, that he did not &s;ee how they could be prevented, and the Nation made &s;afe, by any other way, but by inviting the next Succe&s;&s;or to come and live among us. The Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> the Earls of <HI>Roche&s;ter, Nottingham,</HI> and <HI>An|gle&s;ey</HI> carried on the Debate, with great Earne&s;tne&s;s: It was urged, that they had &s;worn to maintain the Succe&s;&s;ion, and by that they were bound to in&s;i&s;t on this Motion, &s;ince there was no means &s;o &s;ure to maintain it, as to have the Succe&s;&s;or upon the Place, ready to a&s;&s;ume and maintain his Right: It appeared, thro' our
<PB N="430" REF="456">
whole Hi&s;tory, that who&s;oever came fir&s;t into <HI>England,</HI> had al|ways carried it: The pretending Succe&s;&s;or might be in <HI>England</HI> within three Days, whereas it might be three Weeks before the declared Succe&s;&s;or could come: From thence it was inferred, that the Danger was apparent and dreadful, if the Succe&s;&s;or &s;hould not be brought over: If King <HI>Charles</HI> had been in <HI>Spain,</HI> when the late King died, probably that would have prevented all this War, in which we were now engaged. With the&s;e Lords, by a &s;trange rever&s;e, all the Tories joined; and by another, and as &s;trange a re|ver&s;e, all the Whigs joined in oppo&s;ing it. They thought this mat|ter was to be left wholly to the Queen; that it was neither proper nor &s;afe either for the Crown, or for the Nation, that the Heir &s;hould not be in an entire Dependance on the Queen; a Rivalry between two Courts might throw us into great Di&s;tractions, and be attended with very ill Con&s;equences: The next Succe&s;&s;or had expre&s;&s;ed a full Satisfaction, and re&s;ted on the A&s;&s;urances the Queen had given her, of her firm adherence to her Title, and to the maintaining of it: The Nation was prepared for it, by the Orders the Queen had given to name Her in the daily Prayers of the Church: great Endeavours had been u&s;ed, to bring the <HI>Scotch</HI> Nation to declare the &s;ame Succe&s;&s;or. It was true, we &s;till want|ed one great Security, we had not yet made any Provi&s;ion, for carrying on the Government, for maintaining the publick Quiet, for proclaiming and &s;ending for the Succe&s;&s;or; and for keeping things in order, till the Succe&s;&s;or &s;hould come: It &s;eemed there|fore nece&s;&s;ary, to make an effectual Provi&s;ion again&s;t the Di&s;or|ders, that might happen in &s;uch an Interval. This was propo&s;ed fir&s;t by my&s;elf, and it was &s;econded by the Lord <HI>Godolphin,</HI> and all the Whigs went into it; and &s;o the Que&s;tion was put upon the other Motion, as fir&s;t made, by a previous Divi&s;ion, whether that &s;hould be put or not, and was carried in the negative by about three to one.</P>
<P>The Queen heard the Debate, and &s;eemed amazed at the Be|haviour of &s;ome, who when they had Credit with her, and ap|prehended that &s;uch a Motion might be made by the Whigs, had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her with deep Prejudices again&s;t it: For they made her apprehend, that when the next Succe&s;&s;or &s;hould be brought over, &s;he her&s;elf would be &s;o eclip&s;ed by it, that &s;he would be much in the Succe&s;&s;or's power, and reign only at her or his Courte&s;y: Yet the&s;e very Per&s;ons, having now lo&s;t their Intere&s;t in her, and their Po&s;ts, were driving on that very Motion, which they had made her apprehend was the mo&s;t fatal thing that could befall. This the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Marlborough</HI> told me, but &s;he named no Per&s;on: And upon it a very black Su&s;picion was taken up, by
<PB N="431" REF="457">
fome, that the Propo&s;ers of this matter knew or at lea&s;t believed, that the Queen would not agree to the Motion, which way &s;oever it might be brought to her; whether in an Addre&s;s, or in a Bill; and then they might reckon, that this would give &s;uch a Jealou&s;y, and create &s;uch a Mi&s;under&s;tanding between Her and the Parlia|ment, or rather the whole Nation, as would un&s;ettle her whole Government, and put all things in di&s;order. But this was only a Su&s;picion, and more cannot be made of it.</P>
<P>The Lords were now engaged to go on in the Debate for a Re|gency: <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Bill for a Regency.</NOTE> It was opened by the Lord <HI>Wharton</HI> in a manner, that charmed the whole Hou&s;e: He had not been pre&s;ent at the former Debate, but he &s;aid he was much delighted, with what he had heard concerning it; he &s;aid, he had ever looked on the &s;ecuring a Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion to the Crown, as that which &s;ecured all our Happine&s;s: He had heard the Queen recommend from the Throne, Union and Agreement to all her Subjects, with a great Emotion in his own Mind: It was now evident, there was a Di|vinity about her, when &s;he &s;poke; the Cau&s;e was certainly &s;uper|natural, for we &s;aw the Miracle that was wrought by it; now all were for the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion; it had not been always &s;o: He rejoiced in their Conver&s;ion, and confe&s;&s;ed it was a Miracle: He would not, he could not, he ought not to &s;u&s;pect the Sincerity of tho&s;e, who moved for inviting the next Succe&s;&s;or over; yet he could not hinder him&s;elf from remembring what had pa&s;&s;ed, in a cour&s;e of many Years; and how Men had argued, voted and pro|te&s;ted all that while. This confirmed his Opinion that a Miracle was now wrought; and that might oblige &s;ome to &s;hew their change, by an exce&s;s of Zeal, which he could not but commend, tho' he did not fully agree to it. After this Preamble, he opened the Propo&s;ition for the Regency, in all the branches of it; That Regents &s;hould be empower'd to act, in the name of the Succe&s;&s;or, till he &s;hould &s;end over Orders: That be&s;ides tho&s;e, whom the Parliament &s;hould name, the next Succe&s;&s;or &s;hould &s;end over a Nomination &s;ealed up, and to be opened, when that Accident &s;hould happen, of Per&s;ons who &s;hould act in the &s;ame capacity, with tho&s;e who &s;hould be named by Parliament: So the Motion being thus dige&s;ted, was agreed to by all the Whigs, and a Bill was ordered to be brought in, pur&s;uant to the&s;e Propo&s;itions. But upon the Debate on the Heads of the Bill, it did appear that the Conver&s;ion, which the Lord <HI>Wharton</HI> had &s;o plea&s;antly mag|nified, was not &s;o entire as he &s;eemed to &s;uppo&s;e: There was &s;ome cau&s;e given to doubt of the Miracle; for when a Security, that was real and vi&s;ible, was thus offered, tho&s;e who made the other Motion, flew off from it. They pretended, that it was, be|cau&s;e
<PB N="432" REF="458">
they could not go off from their fir&s;t Motion; but they were told, that the immediate Succe&s;&s;or might indeed, during her Life, continue in <HI>England,</HI> yet it was not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that her Son the <HI>Elector</HI> could be always ab&s;ent from his own Dominions, and throw off all care of them, and of the Concerns of the Empire, in which He bore &s;o great a &s;hare. If he &s;hould go over, for ever &s;o &s;hort a time, the Accident might happen, in which it was certainly ne|ce&s;&s;ary to provide &s;uch an Expedient, as was now offered. This laid them open to much Cen&s;ure, but Men engaged in Parties are not ea&s;ily put out of countenance. It was re&s;olved, that the Re|gents &s;hould be &s;even and no more; and they were fixed by the Po&s;ts they were in: The Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> the Lord <HI>Keeper,</HI> the Lord <HI>Trea&s;urer,</HI> Lord <HI>Pre&s;ident,</HI> Lord <HI>Privy Seal,</HI> Lord <HI>High Admiral,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Chief Ju&s;tice</HI> for the time being, were named for that high Tru&s;t. The Tories &s;truggled hard, that the Lord <HI>Trea&s;urer</HI> &s;hould not be one, only to &s;hew their Spite to the Lord <HI>Godolphin,</HI> but the Motion was rejected with &s;corn; for it &s;eemed ridiculous, in a time, when there might be much oc|ca&s;ion for Mony, to exclude an Officer from that high Tru&s;t, who alone could furni&s;h them with it, or direct them how to be fur|ni&s;hed. The Tories moved, that the Lord <HI>Mayor</HI> of <HI>London</HI> &s;hould be one, but that was likewi&s;e rejected: for the De&s;ign of the Act was, that the Government &s;hould be carried on, by tho&s;e who &s;hould be at that time in the conduct and &s;ecret of Affairs, and were Per&s;ons nominated by the Queen; whereas the Lord <HI>Mayor</HI> was cho&s;en by the City, and had no practice in bu&s;ine&s;s. The&s;e Regents were required to proclaim the next Succe&s;&s;or, and to give Orders for the like Proclamation over <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ire|land:</HI> The next Succe&s;&s;or might &s;end a Triplicate of the Per&s;ons, named by Her or Him; One of the&s;e was to be depo&s;ited with the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> another with the Lord <HI>Keeper,</HI> and a third with his own Mini&s;ter, re&s;iding at this Court; upon the producing whereof, the Per&s;ons nominated were to join with the Regents, and to act in equality with them: The la&s;t Parliament, even tho' di&s;&s;olved, was to be pre&s;ently brought together, and empower'd to continue &s;itting for &s;ix Months; and thus things were to be kept in order, till the Succe&s;&s;or &s;hould either come in Per&s;on, or &s;end over his Orders.</P>
<P>The Tories made &s;ome oppo&s;ition to every Branch of the Act, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Op|po&s;ition made to it.</NOTE> but in that of the Parliament's &s;itting, the Oppo&s;ition was more remarkable: The Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> moved, that the Parliament and the Regents &s;hould be limited, to pa&s;s no Act of Repeal, of any part of the Act of <HI>Uniformity,</HI> and in his po&s;itive way &s;aid, if this was not agreed to, he &s;hould &s;till think the Church was in
<PB N="433" REF="459">
danger, notwith&s;tanding what they had heard from the Throne, in the beginning of the Se&s;&s;ion. It was objected to this, that if the Regal Power was in the Regents, and if the Parliament was likewi&s;e a legal one, then by the Con&s;titution the whole Legi&s;|lature was in them, and that could not be limited: for they could repeal any Law that limited them; but the Judges were of opi|nion, that the Power of Regents might be limited: &s;o that, as the de&s;ign of moving this might be, to have a new colour to po&s;&s;e&s;s the Clergy, that there was a &s;ecret De&s;ign again&s;t the Church, which might break out at &s;uch a time, the Lords gave way to it, tho' they thought it unrea&s;onable, and propo&s;ed with no good De&s;ign. The Tories, upon the yielding this to them, propo&s;ed a great many more Limitations, &s;uch as the re&s;training the Regents from con&s;enting to a Repeal of the Act for Triennial Parliaments, the Acts for Trials in Ca&s;es of Trea&s;on, and &s;ome others: and &s;o extravagant were they, in their De&s;ign of making the Act appear ridiculous, that they propo&s;ed as a Limitation, that they &s;hould not have Power to repeal the Acts of Succe&s;&s;ion: All the&s;e were re|jected with Scorn and Indignation; the Lords &s;eeing by this their Error in yielding to that, propo&s;ed by the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter.</HI> The Bill pa&s;&s;ed in the Hou&s;e of Lords, but the Tories prote&s;ted again&s;t it.</P>
<P>I never knew any thing, in the management of the Tories, by which they &s;uffered more in their Reputation, than by this: They hoped, that the Motion for the Invitation would have cleared them of all Su&s;picions, of Inclinations towards the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and would have reconciled the Body of the Nation to them, and turned them again&s;t all, who &s;hould oppo&s;e it: But the Progre&s;s of the Matter produced a contrary effect: The Management was &s;o ill di&s;gui&s;ed, that it was vi&s;ible they intended only to provoke the Queen by it, hoping that the Provocation might go &s;o far, that in the Sequel all their De&s;igns might be brought about, tho' by a method that &s;eemed quite contrary to them, and de&s;tructive of them.</P>
<P>The Bill lay long in the Hou&s;e of Commons, by a &s;ecret Ma|nagement, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A &s;ecret Manage|ment in the Hou&s;e of Commons.</NOTE> that was again&s;t it: The Tories there likewi&s;e propo&s;ed, that the next Succe&s;&s;or &s;hould be brought over; which was oppo&s;ed by the Whigs, not by any Vote again&s;t it, but by re&s;olving to go thro' the Lords Bill fir&s;t: The &s;ecret Management was from <HI>Hanover.</HI> Some indigent Per&s;ons, and others imployed by the Tories, had &s;tudied to infu&s;e Jealou&s;ies of the Queen and Her Mi|ni&s;ters, into the old <HI>Electore&s;s.</HI> She was then Seventy-five; but had &s;till &s;o much Vivacity, that as &s;he was the mo&s;t knowing, and the mo&s;t entertaining Woman of the Age, &s;o &s;he &s;eemed willing to
<PB N="434" REF="460">
change her Scene, and to come and &s;hine among us here in <HI>Eng|land;</HI> they prevailed with Her to write a Letter to the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> intimating Her readine&s;s to come over, if the Queen and Parliament &s;hould de&s;ire it: This was made publick by the intriguing Per&s;ons in that Court: And a colour was &s;oon found, to keep &s;ome Whigs from agreeing to the Act. In the Act that fir&s;t &s;ettled the Succe&s;&s;ion, One Limitation (as was told in its proper place) had been, that when the Crown &s;hould pa&s;s into that Hou&s;e, no Man who had either Place or Pen&s;ion &s;hould be capa|ble of &s;itting in the Hou&s;e of Commons: The Clau&s;e in this Bill, that empowered either the Parliament, that &s;hould be current at the Queen's Death, or that which had &s;ate la&s;t (tho' di&s;&s;olved) to &s;it for &s;ix Months, or till the Succe&s;&s;or &s;hould di&s;&s;olve it, &s;eemed contrary to this incapacitating Clau&s;e, in the former Act. Great Exceptions were taken to this by &s;ome zealous Whigs, who were &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the Notion of a &s;elf-denying Bill, as nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve Publick Liberty, from the Practices of a de&s;igning Court, that for &s;ome Weeks there was cau&s;e to fear, not only the lo&s;s of the Bill, but a Breach among the Whigs upon this head: Much Pains were taken, and with very good effect, to heal this: It was at la&s;t &s;ettled; a great many Offices were enumerated, and it was declared that every Man, who held any of the&s;e, was thereby incapacitated from &s;itting in the Hou&s;e of Commons; and every Member of the Hou&s;e, who did accept of any other Office, was upon that excluded the Hou&s;e, and a new Writ was to go out, to tho&s;e whom he repre&s;ented, to choo&s;e again; but it was left free to them to choo&s;e him, or any other as they plea&s;ed. It was <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Act of the Regency pa&s;t.</NOTE> de&s;ired by tho&s;e, who pre&s;&s;ed this Matter mo&s;t, that it &s;hould take place only in the next Reign: But to remove all Jealou&s;y, the Mini&s;ters were content, that the&s;e Clau&s;es &s;hould take place immediately, upon the Di&s;&s;olution of the pre&s;ent Parliament. And when the Hou&s;e of Commons &s;ent up the&s;e &s;elf-denying Clau&s;es to the Lords, they added to them a Repeal of that Clau&s;e, in the fir&s;t Act of Succe&s;&s;ion, by which the &s;ucceeding Princes were limited to govern by the Advice of their Council, and by which all the Privy-Coun&s;ellors were to be obliged to &s;ign their Advices; which was impracticable, &s;ince it was vi&s;ible that no Man would be a Privy-Coun&s;ellor on tho&s;e Terms: The Lords added the Repeal of this Clau&s;e, to the Amendments &s;ent up by the Commons; and the Commons readily agreed to it.</P>
<P>After this Act had pa&s;&s;ed, the Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> remembring what the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> had &s;aid, concerning the Danger the Church <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Dan|ger$ of the Church en|quired into.</NOTE> might be in, moved that a Day might be appointed, to enquire into tho&s;e Dangers, about which &s;o many tragical Stories had been
<PB N="435" REF="461">
publi&s;hed of late: A Day was appointed for this, and we were all made believe, that we &s;hould hear many frightful things: But our Expectations were not an&s;wered: &s;ome &s;poke of Danger from the Presbytery, that was &s;ettled in <HI>Scotland:</HI> Some &s;poke of the Ab&s;ence of the next Succe&s;&s;or: Some reflected on the Occa&s;ional Bill, that was rejected in that Hou&s;e: Some complained of the Schools of the Di&s;&s;enters: And others reflected on the Principles, that many had drank in, that were different from tho&s;e formerly received, and that &s;eemed de&s;tructive of the Church.</P>
<P>In oppo&s;ition to all this, it was &s;aid, that the Church was &s;afer now, than ever it had been: At the Revolution, Provi&s;ion was made, that our King mu&s;t be of the Reformed Religion, nor was this all; in the late Act of Succe&s;&s;ion it was enacted, that he &s;hould be of the Communion of the Church of <HI>England:</HI> It was not rea&s;onable to object to the Hou&s;e the rejecting a Bill, which was done by the Majority, of whom it became not the le&s;&s;er number to complain: We had all our former Laws left to us, not only entire, but fortified by late Additions and Explanations: So that we were &s;afer in all the&s;e, than we had been at any time formerly: The Di&s;&s;enters gained no new Strength, they were vi&s;ibly de|crea&s;ing: The Toleration had &s;oftened their Tempers, and they concurred zealou&s;ly in &s;erving all the Ends of the Government: Nor was there any particular Complaint brought again&s;t them: They &s;eemed quiet and content with their Toleration; if they could be but &s;ecure of enjoying it: The Queen was taking the mo&s;t ef|fectual means po&s;&s;ible, to deliver the Clergy from the Depre&s;&s;ions of Poverty, that brought them under much Contempt, and de|nied them the nece&s;&s;ary means and helps of Study: The Bi&s;hops looked after their Dioce&s;es with a care, that had not been known in the Memory of Man: Great Sums were yearly rai&s;ed, by their care and zeal, for &s;erving the Plantations, better than had ever yet been done: A Spirit of Zeal and Piety appeared in our Churches, and at Sacrament beyond the example of former Times. In one re&s;pect it was acknowledged the Church was in danger; there was an evil Spirit and a virulent Temper &s;pread among the Clergy; there were many indecent Sermons preached on publick Occa|&s;ions, and tho&s;e hot Clergy-men, who were not the mo&s;t regu|lar in their Lives, had rai&s;ed Factions in many Dioce&s;es again&s;t their Bi&s;hops: The&s;e were Dangers created by tho&s;e very Men, who filled the Nation with this Out-cry, again&s;t imaginary ones, while their own Conduct produced real and threatning Dangers. Many &s;evere Reflections were thrown out on both &s;ides, in the Progre&s;s of this Debate.</P>
<P><PB N="436" REF="462">
It ended in a Vote carried by a great Majority: That the Church of <HI>England,</HI> under the Queen's happy Admini&s;tration, was in a &s;afe and flouri&s;hing condition; and to this a &s;evere Cen|&s;ure <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Vote and an Addre&s;s to the Queen about that.</NOTE> was added, on the Spreaders of the&s;e Reports of Dangers; that they were the Enemies of the Queen and of Her Government. They al&s;o re&s;olved to make an Addre&s;s to the Queen, in which, after this was &s;et forth, they prayed Her to order a Pro&s;ecution, according to Law, of all who &s;hould be found guilty of this Of|fence: They &s;ent this down to the Hou&s;e of Commons, where the Debate was brought over again, but it was run down with great force: The Commons agreed with the Lords, and both Hou&s;es went together to the Queen with this Addre&s;s. Such a Concurrence of both Hou&s;es had not been &s;een for &s;ome Years: And indeed there was in both &s;o great a Majority, for carrying on all the Intere&s;ts of the Government; that the Men of ill Inten|tions had no hopes, during the whole Se&s;&s;ion, of embroiling Mat|ters, but in the Debates concerning the &s;elf-denying Clau&s;e a|bovementioned.</P>
<P>But tho' the main De&s;igns and Hopes of the Party had thus not only failed them, but turned again&s;t them; yet they re&s;olved <NOTE PLACE="marg">1706. Complaints of the Allies rejected.</NOTE> to make another attempt: It was on the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> tho' they &s;poke of him with great re&s;pect. They complained of the Errors committed this Year, in the Conduct of the War: They indeed laid the blame, of the Mi&s;carriage of the De&s;ign on the <HI>Mo&s;elle,</HI> on the Prince of <HI>Baden,</HI> and the Errors committed in <HI>Brabant,</HI> on the <HI>States</HI> and their Deputies; but they &s;aid they could not judge of the&s;e things, nor be able to lay before the Queen tho&s;e Advices, that might be fit for them to offer to Her, unle&s;s they were made acquainted with the whole Series of tho&s;e Affairs: therefore they propo&s;ed, that by an Addre&s;s, they might pray the Queen to communicate to them, all that &s;he knew con|cerning tho&s;e Tran&s;actions, during the la&s;t Campaign: for they reckoned, that if all particulars &s;hould be laid before them, they would find &s;omewhat in the Duke of <HI>Marlborough's</HI> Conduct, on which a Cen&s;ure might be fixed. To this it was an&s;wered, that if any Complaint was brought, again&s;t any of the Queen's Sub|jects, it would be rea&s;onable for them to enquire into it, by all proper ways: but the Hou&s;e of Lords could not pretend to exa|mine or to cen&s;ure the Conduct of the Queen's Allies: they were not &s;ubject to them, nor could they be heard to ju&s;tify them|&s;elves: and it was &s;omewhat extraordinary, if they &s;hould pa&s;s a Cen&s;ure or make a Complaint of them. It was one of the Tru&s;ts that was lodged with the Government, to manage all Treaties
<PB N="437" REF="463">
and Alliances: So that our Commerce with our Allies was wholly in the Crown: Allies might &s;ometimes fail, being not able to perform what they undertook: They are &s;ubject both to Errors and Accidents, and are &s;ometimes ill-&s;erved: The entring into that Matter was not at all proper for the Hou&s;e, unle&s;s it was intended to run into ra&s;h and indi&s;creet Cen&s;ures, on de&s;ign to provoke the Allies, and by that means to weaken, if not break the Alliance: The Queen would no doubt endeavour to redre&s;s what&s;oever was ami&s;s, and that mu&s;t be tru&s;ted to her Conduct.</P>
<P>So this Attempt not only failed, but it happened upon this, as upon other occa&s;ions, that it was turned again&s;t tho&s;e who made it: An Addre&s;s was made to the Queen, praying Her to go on in her Alliances, and in particular to cultivate a perfect Union and Corre&s;pondence, with the <HI>States</HI> of the <HI>United Provinces:</HI> This had a very good effect in <HI>Holland,</HI> for the Agents of <HI>France</HI> were, at the &s;ame time, both &s;preading Reports among us, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> were inclined to a Peace; and among them, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had very unkind Thoughts of them: The de&s;ign was, to alienate us from one another, that &s;o both might be thereby the better di&s;po|&s;ed to hearken to a Project of Peace; which in the &s;tate, in which Matters were at that time, was the mo&s;t de&s;tructive thing that could be thought on: And all Motions that look'd that way, gave very evident Di&s;coveries of the bad Intentions of tho&s;e, who made them.</P>
<P>The next Bu&s;ine&s;s, of a Publick Nature, that came before the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Acts again&s;t the the <HI>Scot.</HI> $epealed.</NOTE> Parliament, was carried very unanimou&s;ly: The Queen laid be|fore the two Hou&s;es the Addre&s;&s;es of the <HI>Scotch</HI> Parliament, again&s;t any Progre&s;s in the Treaty of Union, till the Act, which declared them Aliens by &s;uch a Day, &s;hould be repealed: The Tories, upon this occa&s;ion, to make them&s;elves popular, after they had failed in many Attempts, re&s;olved to promote this; apprehend|ing that the Whigs, who had fir&s;t moved for that Act, would be for maintaining their own Work: but they &s;eemed to be much &s;urprized, when after they had prefaced their Motions in this matter, with &s;uch Declarations of their Intentions for the publick Good, that &s;hewed they expected Oppo&s;ition and a Debate, the Whigs not only agreed to this, but carried the Motion further, to the other Act relating to their Manufacture and Trade. This pa&s;&s;ed very unanimou&s;ly in both Hou&s;es; and by this means way was made, for opening a Treaty, as &s;oon as the Se&s;&s;ion &s;hould come to an end. All the Northern Parts of <HI>England,</HI> which had been di&s;turbed for &s;ome years, with Apprehen&s;ions of a War with <HI>Scotland,</HI> that would certainly be mi&s;chievous to them, what|&s;oever
<PB N="438" REF="464">
the End of it might prove, were much delighted with the pro&s;pect of Peace and Union with their Neighbours.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the mo&s;t important Debates during this Se&s;&s;ion; at all which the Queen was pre&s;ent: She &s;taid all the while, and hearkned to every thing with great Attention. The Debates were managed on the one &s;ide, by the Lords <HI>Godolphin, Wharton, Sommers, Halifax, Sunderland,</HI> and <HI>Town&s;hend;</HI> on the other &s;ide by the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and the Lords <HI>Roche&s;ter, Not|tingham, Angle&s;ey, Guern&s;ey,</HI> and <HI>Haver&s;ham.</HI> There was &s;o much Strength and Clearne&s;s on the one &s;ide, and &s;o much Heat and Artifice on the other, that nothing but ob&s;tinate Partiality could re&s;i&s;t &s;o evident a Conviction.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of Commons went on in creating Funds, for the Supplies they had voted, for the next year: And the Nation was <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Publick Credit very high.</NOTE> &s;o well &s;atisfied with the Government, and the Conduct of Af|fairs, that a Fund being created for Two Millions and a half, by way of Annuities for Ninety-nine Years, at Six and a half <HI>per Cent.</HI> at the end of which the Capital was to &s;ink; the whole Sum was &s;ub&s;cribed, in a very few days: At the &s;ame time the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> propo&s;ed the Advance of a Sum of 500,000 <HI>l.</HI> to the Emperor, for the u&s;e of Prince <HI>Eugene,</HI> and the Service of <HI>Italy,</HI> upon a Branch of the Emperor's Revenue in <HI>Sile&s;ia,</HI> at Eight <HI>per Cent.</HI> and the Capital to be repaid in eight Years: The Nation did &s;o abound, both in Money and Zeal, that this was likewi&s;e advanced in a very few days: Our Armies, as well as our Allies, were every where punctually paid: The Credit of the Nation was never rai&s;ed &s;o high in any Age, nor &s;o &s;acredly main|tained: The Trea&s;ury was as exact and as regular in all Pay|ments, as any private Banker could be. It is true, a great deal of Money went out of the Kingdom in Specie: That which main|tained the War in <HI>Spain,</HI> was to be &s;ent thither in that manner, the way by Bills of Exchange not being yet opened: Our Trade with <HI>Spain</HI> and the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> which formerly brought us great Returns of Money, was now &s;topt: by this means there grew to be a &s;en&s;ible Want of Money over the Nation: This was in a great mea&s;ure &s;upplied, by the Currency of Exchequer-Bills and Bank-Notes: And this lay &s;o obvious to the di&s;affected Party, that they were often attempting to bla&s;t, at lea&s;t to di&s;parage this Paper Credit: But it was &s;till kept up. It bred a ju&s;t Indignation in all, who had a true Love to their Country, to &s;ee &s;ome u&s;ing all po&s;|&s;ible methods to &s;hake the Admini&s;tration, which, notwith&s;tand|ing the Difficulties at home and abroad, was much the be&s;t that had been in the memory of Man: And was certainly not only
<PB N="439" REF="465">
ea&s;y to the Subjects in general, but gentle even towards tho&s;e, who were endeavouring to undermine it.</P>
<P>The Lord <HI>Sommers</HI> made a Motion in the Hou&s;e of Lords, to <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Bill to re|gulate Pro|ceedings at Law.</NOTE> correct &s;ome of the Proceedings in the Common Law, and in Chan|cery, that were both dilatory and very chargeable: He began the Motion with &s;ome In&s;tances, that were more con&s;picuous and gro&s;s; and he managed the Matter &s;o, that both the Lord <HI>Keeper</HI> and <HI>Judges</HI> concurred with him; tho' it pa&s;&s;es generally for a Maxim, that Judges ought rather to enlarge, than contract their Juri&s;diction. A Bill pa&s;&s;ed the Hou&s;e, that began a Reformation of Proceedings at Law, which, as Things now &s;tand, are certainly among the greate&s;t Grievances of the Nation: When this went thro' the Hou&s;e of Commons, it was vi&s;ible that the Intere&s;t of Under-Of|ficers, Clerks, and Attorneys, who&s;e Gains were to be le&s;&s;ened by this Bill, was more con&s;idered, than the Intere&s;t of the Nation it &s;elf: Several Clau&s;es, how beneficial &s;oever to the Subject, which touched on their Profit, were left out by the Commons. But what Fault &s;oever the Lords might have found with the&s;e Altera|tions, yet to avoid all Di&s;putes with the Commons, they agreed to their Amendments.</P>
<P>There was another general Complaint made of the private Acts of Parliament, that pa&s;&s;ed thro' both Hou&s;es too ea&s;ily, and in &s;o great a number, that it took up a great part of the Se&s;&s;ion to examine them, even in that cur&s;ory way, that was &s;ubject to many Inconveniencies: The Fees that were paid for the&s;e, to the Speakers and Clerks of both Hou&s;es, inclined them to favour and promote them: So the Lord <HI>Sommers</HI> propo&s;ed &s;uch a Regulation in that matter, as will probably have a good effect for the future. The pre&s;ent Lord <HI>Keeper</HI> did indeed very generou&s;ly ob&s;truct tho&s;e Private Bills, as much as his Predece&s;&s;or had promoted them: He did another thing of a great Example; On the fir&s;t day of the year, it was become a Cu&s;tom, for all tho&s;e who practi&s;ed in <HI>Chancery,</HI> to offer a New-year's Gift to the Lord, who had the Great Seal: the&s;e grew to be &s;o con&s;iderable, that they amounted to 1500 <HI>l.</HI> a year: On this New-year's day, which was his fir&s;t, he &s;ignified to all who, according to cu&s;tom, were expected to come with their Pre&s;ents, that he would receive none, but would break that cu&s;tom. He thought it looked, like the in&s;inuating them&s;elves into the favour of the Court; and that if it was not Bribery, yet it came too near it, and looked too like it: This con|tributed not a little to the rai&s;ing his Character: He managed the Court of Chancery with impartial Ju&s;tice, and great Di&s;patch; and was very u&s;eful to the Hou&s;e of Lords, in the promoting of Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="440" REF="466">
When the Se&s;&s;ion was near an end, great Complaints were made in both Hou&s;es of the Progre&s;s of Popery in <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> and of many In&s;olencies committed there, both by the Laity and Prie&s;ts <NOTE PLACE="marg">Complaints of the Pro|gre&s;s of Po|pery.</NOTE> of that Religion: Upon this a Bill was brought into the Hou&s;e of Commons, with Clau&s;es that would have rendred the Bill, pa&s;t again&s;t Papi&s;ts in the End of the la&s;t Reign, effectual: This alarm'd all of that Religion: &s;o that they made very powerful (or to follow the Raillery of that Time) very weighty Interce&s;&s;ions with the con&s;iderable Men of that Hou&s;e. The Court look'd on, and &s;eem'd indifferent in the Matter, yet it was given out that &s;o &s;evere a Law would be very unrea&s;onable; when we were in Alliance with &s;o many Princes of that Religion, and that it mu&s;t le&s;&s;en the Force of the Queen's Interce&s;&s;ion, in favour of the Prote&s;tants, that liv'd in the Dominions of tho&s;e Princes: The Proceeding &s;eem'd rigorous, and not &s;uited to the Gentlene&s;s, that the Chri&s;tian Religion did &s;o particularly recommend, and was contrary to the Maxims of Liberty of Con&s;cience and Tole|ration, that were then in great vogue. It was an&s;wered, that the Dependance of tho&s;e of that Religion, on a foreign Juri&s;dic|tion, and at pre&s;ent on a foreign Pretender to the Crown, put them out of the ca&s;e of other Subjects, who might differ from the e&s;tabli&s;hed Religion; &s;ince there &s;eemed to be good rea&s;on to con|&s;ider them as Enemies, rather than as Subjects. But the Applica|tion was made in &s;o effectual a manner, that the Bill was let fall: And tho' the Lords had made &s;ome Steps towards &s;uch a Bill, yet &s;ince they &s;aw what Fate it was like to have in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, in&s;tead of proceeding farther in it, they di&s;mi&s;&s;ed that matter with an Addre&s;s to the Queen, that &s;he would give Orders, both to the Ju&s;tices of Peace, and to the Clergy, that a Return might be made to the next Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, of all the Pa|pi&s;ts in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>There was another Project &s;et on foot at this time by the Lord <NOTE PLACE="marg">A De&s;ign for a Publick Library.</NOTE> <HI>Halifax,</HI> for putting the Records and the Publick Offices of the Kingdom in better order: He had, in a former Se&s;&s;ion, moved the Lords to &s;end &s;ome of their number to view the Records in the <HI>Tower,</HI> which were in great di&s;order, and in a vi&s;ible decay for want of &s;ome more Officers, and by the Neglect of tho&s;e we had. The&s;e Lords in their Report propo&s;ed &s;ome Regulations for the future, which have been &s;ince followed &s;o effectually, though at a con&s;iderable Charge, by creating &s;everal new Officers, that the Nation will reap the Benefit of all this very &s;en&s;ibly: But Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> carried his Project much further. The famous Library, collected by Sir <HI>Robert Cotton,</HI> and continued down in his Family, was the greate&s;t Collection of Manu&s;cripts relating to the Publick,
<PB N="441" REF="467">
that perhaps any Nation in <HI>Europe</HI> could &s;hew: The late Owner of it, Sir <HI>John Cotton,</HI> had, by his Will, left it to the Publick, but in &s;uch Words, that it was rather &s;hut up, than made any way u&s;eful: And indeed it was to be &s;o carefully pre|&s;erved, that none could be the better for it: So that Lord moved the Hou&s;e to intreat the Queen, that &s;he would be plea&s;ed to buy <HI>Cotton-Hou&s;e,</HI> which &s;tood ju&s;t between the two Hou&s;es of Par|liament; &s;o that &s;ome part of that Ground would furni&s;h them with many u&s;eful Rooms, and there would be enough left, for building a noble Structure for a Library: To which, be&s;ides the <HI>Cotton</HI> Library and the Queen's Library, the Royal Society, who had a very good Library at <HI>Gre&s;ham</HI> College, would remove and keep their A&s;&s;emblies there, as &s;oon as it was made convenient for them. This was a great De&s;ign, which the Lord <HI>Halifax,</HI> who &s;et it fir&s;t on foot, &s;eemed re&s;olved to carry on till it were fini&s;hed: It will &s;et Learning again on foot among us, and be a great ho|nour to the Queen's Reign.</P>
<P>Thus this Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament came to a very happy conclu|&s;ion: There was in it the be&s;t Harmony within both Hou&s;es, and between Them, as well as with the Crown, and it was the be&s;t applauded in the City of <HI>London,</HI> over the whole Nation, and indeed over all <HI>Europe,</HI> of any Se&s;&s;ion that I had ever &s;een: And when it was con&s;idered, that this was the fir&s;t of the three, &s;o that we were to have two other Se&s;&s;ions of the &s;ame Members, it gave an univer&s;al Satisfaction, both to our own People at home, and our Allies abroad, and afforded a pro&s;pect of a happy End, that &s;hould be put to this devouring War, which in all probabi|lity mu&s;t come to a period before the conclu&s;ion of the pre&s;ent Parliament. This gave an un&s;peakable Satisfaction to all who loved their Country and their Religion, who now hoped that we had in view a good and a &s;afe Peace.</P>
<P>The Convocation &s;ate at the &s;ame time; it was cho&s;en as the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceeding$ in C$span$vo|cation.</NOTE> former had been, and the Members, that were ill affected, were &s;till prevailed on to come up, and to continue in an expen&s;ive but u&s;ele&s;s Attendance in Town. The Bi&s;hops drew up an Addre&s;s to the Queen, in which, as the two Hou&s;es of Parliament had done, they expre&s;&s;ed a ju&s;t Indignation at the Jealou&s;ies, that had been &s;pread about the Nation, of the Danger of the Church: When this was communicated to the Lower Hou&s;e, they refu&s;ed to join in it, but would give no rea&s;on for their Refu&s;al: They drew an Addre&s;s of their own, in which no notice was taken of the&s;e A&s;per&s;ions: The Bi&s;hops, according to antient Precedents, required them either to agree to their Addre&s;s, or to offer their Objections again&s;t it; they would do neither; &s;o the Addre&s;s was
<PB N="442" REF="468">
let fall: And upon that, a &s;top was put to all further Communi|cation between the two Hou&s;es. The Lower Hou&s;e, upon this, went on in their former practice of intermediate Se&s;&s;ions, in which they began to enter upon Bu&s;ine&s;s, to approve of &s;ome Books, and to cen&s;ure others; and they re&s;olved to proceed upon the &s;ame Grounds, that factious Men among them had before &s;et up, tho' the Fal&s;hood of their Preten&s;ions had been evidently made to ap|pear. The Archbi&s;hop had prorogued them to the fir&s;t of <HI>March:</HI> When that day came, the Lower Hou&s;e was &s;urprized with a Prote&s;tation, that was brought to the Upper Hou&s;e, by a great part of their Body, who, being di&s;&s;atisfied with the Proceedings of the Majority, and having long &s;truggled again&s;t them, tho' in vain, at la&s;t drew up a Prote&s;tation again&s;t them: They &s;ent it up and down, thro' the whole Province, that they might get as many Hands to it as they could; but the matter was managed with &s;uch caution, that tho' it was in many Hands, yet it was not known to the other &s;ide, till they heard it was pre&s;ented to the Pre&s;ident of the Upper Hou&s;e: In it, all the irregular Mo|tions of the Lower Hou&s;e were reckoned up, in&s;i&s;ting more par|ticularly on that of holding intermediate Se&s;&s;ions, again&s;t all which they prote&s;ted, and prayed that their Prote&s;tation might be en|tered in the Books of the Upper Hou&s;e, that &s;o they might not be involved in the Guilt of the re&s;t: This was &s;igned by above Fifty, and the whole Body was but an Hundred and Forty-five: Some were neutral: So that hereby very near one half broke off from the re&s;t, and left them, and &s;ate no more with them. The Lower Hou&s;e was deliberating how to vent their Indignation again&s;t the&s;e, when a more &s;en&s;ible Mortification followed: The Arch|bi&s;hop &s;ent for them, and when they came up; He read a Let|ter to them, that was wrote to him by the Queen, in which &s;he took notice that the Differences between the two Hou&s;es were &s;till kept up; &s;he was much concerned, to &s;ee that they were rather encrea&s;ed than abated: She was the more &s;urprized at this, be|cau&s;e it had been her con&s;tant Care, as it &s;hould continue always to be, to pre&s;erve the Con&s;titution of the Church, as it was by Law e&s;tabli&s;hed, and to di&s;countenance all Divi&s;ions and Innova|tions what&s;oever: She was re&s;olved to maintain her Supremacy, and the due Subordination of Presbyters to Bi&s;hops, as fundamen|tal Parts of it: She expected, that the Archbi&s;hop and Bi&s;hops would act conformable to this Re&s;olution, and in &s;o doing they &s;hould be &s;ure of the continuance of her Protection and Favour, which &s;hould not be wanting to any of the Clergy, as long as they were true to the Con&s;titution, and dutiful to Her, and their Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Superiors, and pre&s;erved &s;uch a Temper, as became
<PB N="443" REF="469">
tho&s;e, who were in Holy Orders. The Archbi&s;hop, as he was re|quired to read this to them, &s;o he was directed to prorogue them, for &s;uch a time as &s;hould appear convenient to him: They were &s;truck with this, for it had been carried &s;o &s;ecretly, that it was a Surprize to them all. When they &s;aw they were to be prorogued, they ran very indecently to the Door, and with &s;ome difficulty were kept in the Room, till the Prorogation was intimated to them: They went next to their own Hou&s;e, where, tho' pro|rogued, they &s;ate &s;till in form, as if they had been a Hou&s;e, but they did not venture on pa&s;&s;ing any Vote: So factious were they, and &s;o implicitly led by tho&s;e, who had got an A&s;cendant over them, that tho' they had formerly &s;ubmitted the Matters in de|bate to the Queen, yet now, when &s;he declared her Plea&s;ure, they would not acquie&s;ce in it.</P>
<P>The Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament being now at an end, the Preparations <NOTE PLACE="marg">Prepara|tions for the Campaign.</NOTE> for the Campaign were carried on with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch: That which was mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing was fir&s;t done. Upon <HI>Stanhope</HI>'s fir&s;t coming over, in the beginning of <HI>January,</HI> Orders were imme|diately i&s;&s;ued out for &s;ending over 5000 Men, with all nece&s;&s;ary Stores to <HI>Spain:</HI> The Orders were given in very pre&s;&s;ing Terms; yet &s;o many Offices were concerned in the Execution, that many Delays were made, &s;ome of the&s;e were much cen&s;ured; at la&s;t they &s;ailed in <HI>March.</HI> The Fleet that had gone into the <HI>Medi|terranean</HI> with King <HI>Charles,</HI> and was to return and winter at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> was detained by We&s;terly Winds longer in tho&s;e Seas, than had been expected.</P>
<P>The People of <HI>Valencia</HI> &s;eemed to hope, that they were to <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Revolt in <HI>Valencia.</HI></NOTE> winter in tho&s;e Seas; and by this they were encouraged to declare for King <HI>Charles:</HI> but they were much expo&s;ed to tho&s;e, who commanded in King <HI>Philip</HI>'s name. All <HI>Catalonia</HI> had &s;ubmitted to King <HI>Charles</HI> except <HI>Ro&s;es;</HI> Garri&s;ons were put in <HI>Gironne, Le|rida,</HI> and <HI>Torto&s;a:</HI> and the States of that Principality prepared them&s;elves, with great Zeal and Re&s;olution, for the next Cam|paign, which, they had rea&s;on to expect, would come both early and &s;everely upon them. There was a Breach, between the Earl of <HI>Peterborough</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Lichten&s;tein,</HI> whom he charged very heavily, in the King's own pre&s;ence, with Corruption and Inju&s;tice: The Matter went far, and the King blamed the Earl of <HI>Peterborough,</HI> who had not much of a forbearing or for|giving temper in him. There was no method of Communication with <HI>England</HI> yet &s;ettled: We did not hear from them, nor they from us, in five Months: This put them out of all hope: Our Men wanted every thing, and could be &s;upplied there with no|thing. The Revolt in <HI>Valencia</HI> made it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end &s;uch a
<PB N="444" REF="470">
Supply to them from <HI>Barcelona,</HI> as could be &s;pared from thence: The Di&s;gu&s;t that was taken, made it advi&s;eable to &s;end the Earl of <HI>Peterborough</HI> thither, and he willingly undertook the Service: He marched towards that Kingdom with about Fifteen Hundred <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and a Thou&s;and <HI>Spaniards:</HI> They were all ill equipped and ill furni&s;hed, without Artillery, and with very little Ammuni|tion: But as they marched, all the Country either came in to them, or fled before them. He got to <HI>Valencia</HI> without any Oppo&s;ition, and was received there with all po&s;&s;ible Demon&s;trations of Joy: This gave a great di&s;turbance to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Councils at <HI>Madrid:</HI> They advi&s;ed the King, to begin with the Reduction of <HI>Valencia:</HI> It lay nearer, and was ea&s;ier come at: And by this the Di&s;po&s;i|tion to revolt would be checked, which might otherwi&s;e go fur|ther: But this was over-ruled from <HI>France,</HI> where little regard was had to the <HI>Spaniards:</HI> They re&s;olved to begin with <HI>Bar|celona:</HI> In it King <HI>Charles</HI> him&s;elf lay; and on taking it, they reckoned all the re&s;t would fall.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> re&s;olved to &s;end every thing, that was nece&s;&s;ary for the Siege by Sea, and the Count of <HI>Toulou&s;e</HI> was ordered to lie <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Siege of <HI>$span$o|na.</HI></NOTE> with the Fle$t before the Place, whil&s;t it was be&s;ieged by Land: It was concerted, to begin the Siege in <HI>March,</HI> for they knew that if they begun it &s;o early, our Fleet could not come in time to relieve it: But two great Storms, that came &s;oon one after another, did &s;o &s;catter their Tartanes, and di&s;able their Ships of War, that as &s;ome were ca&s;t away, and others were much &s;hattered, &s;o they all lo&s;t a Month's time, and the Siege could not be formed before the beginning of <HI>April:</HI> King <HI>Charles</HI> &s;hut him&s;elf up in <HI>Barce|lona,</HI> by which the People were both animated and kept in order: This gave all the Allies very &s;ad Apprehen&s;ions, they feared not only the Lo&s;s of the Place, but of his Per&s;on. <HI>Lake</HI> &s;ailed from <HI>Lisbon</HI> in the end of <HI>March:</HI> He mi&s;&s;ed the Galleons very nar|rowly, but he could not pur&s;ue them; for he was to lo&s;e no time, but ha&s;te to <HI>Barcelona:</HI> His Fleet was encrea&s;ed to Thirty Ships of the Line, by the time he got to <HI>Gibraltar;</HI> but tho' Twenty more were following him, he would not &s;tay, but ha&s;ted on to the Relief of the Place, as fa&s;t as the Wind &s;erved.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time the Campaign was opened on the &s;ide of <HI>Portugal:</HI> The Earl of <HI>Gallway</HI> had full Powers and a brave <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A$span$tara</HI> taken.</NOTE> Army of about 20000 Men, well furni&s;hed in all re&s;pects: He le&s;t <HI>Badajos</HI> behind him, and marched on to <HI>Alcantara.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Berwick</HI> had a very &s;mall Force left him, to defend that Frontier: It &s;eems the <HI>French</HI> tru&s;ted to the Intere&s;t they had in the Court of <HI>Portugal:</HI> His Troops were &s;o bad, that he &s;aw in one &s;mall Action, that he could not depend on them: He put a
<PB N="445" REF="471">
good Garri&s;on in <HI>Alcantara;</HI> where their be&s;t Magazine was laid in. But when the Earl of <HI>Gallway</HI> came before the Town, within three Days the Garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;ting of 4000 Men, delivered up the Place and them&s;elves as Pri&s;oners of War: The <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> would have &s;top'd there, and thought they had made a good Campaign, tho' they had done no more: But the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Am|ba&s;&s;ador at <HI>Lisbon</HI> went to the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and pre&s;&s;ed him, that Orders might be immediately &s;ent to the Earl of <HI>Gall|way</HI> to march on: And when he &s;aw great Coldne&s;s in &s;ome of the Mini&s;ters, he threatned a pre&s;ent Rupture, if it was not done: And he continued waiting on the King, till the Orders were &s;igned, and &s;ent away. Upon Receipt of the&s;e, the Earl of <HI>Gall|way</HI> advanced towards <HI>Placentia,</HI> all the Country declaring for him, as &s;oon as he appeared; and the Duke of <HI>Berwick</HI> &s;till re|tiring before him, not being able to give the lea&s;t Interruption to his March.</P>
<P>The Campaign was opened in <HI>Italy</HI> with great advantage to <NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Ger|mans</HI> are de|feated in <HI>Italy.</HI></NOTE> the <HI>French:</HI> The Duke of <HI>Vendome</HI> marched into the <HI>Bre&s;cian,</HI> to attack the Imperiali&s;ts, before Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> could join them, who was now come very near: He fell on a Body of about 12000 of them, being double their number; he drove them from their Po&s;ts, with the Lo&s;s of about 3000 Men killed and taken; but it was believed there were as many of the <HI>French</HI> killed, as of the Imperiali&s;ts. Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> came up within two Days, and put all in order again: He retired to a &s;urer Po&s;t, waiting till the Troops from <HI>Germany</HI> &s;hould come up: The Slowne&s;s of the <HI>Germans</HI> was always fatal, in the beginning of the Campaign: The Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> was now reduced to great Extremities: He &s;aw the Siege of <HI>Turin</HI> was de&s;igned; he fortified &s;o many Out-Po&s;ts, and put &s;o good a Garri&s;on in it, that he prepared well for a long Siege, and a great Re&s;i&s;tance: He wrote to the Queen, for a further Supply of 50000 Pounds, a&s;&s;uring her, that by that means the Place &s;hould be put in &s;o good a State, that he would undertake that all &s;hould be done, which could be expected from brave and re&s;olute Men: And &s;o careful was the Lord Trea&s;urer to encourage him, that the Courier was &s;ent back the next Day, after he came, with credit for the Money. There was &s;ome Hopes of a Peace, as there was an actual Ce&s;&s;ation of War in <HI>Hungary:</HI> The Malecontents had been put in hopes, of a great Diver&s;ion of the Emperor's Forces, on the &s;ide of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> where there was a great In&s;urrection, provoked, as was &s;aid, by the Op|pre&s;&s;ion of the Imperial Officers, who were &s;o accu&s;tomed to be heavy in their Quarters, that when they had the Pretence, that they were among Enemies, it may be ea&s;ily believed, there was
<PB N="446" REF="472">
much ju&s;t occa&s;ion of complaint; And that they were guilty of great Exactions and Rapine. This looked formidably at fir&s;t, and &s;eemed to threaten a new War in tho&s;e Parts; but all was &s;oon &s;uppre&s;&s;ed: The Pea&s;ants had no Officers among them, no Di&s;cipline, nor Magazines, and no Place of Strength: So they were quickly di&s;per&s;ed, and &s;tricter Orders were given, for the better regulating the Military Men, tho' it was not expected that the&s;e would be long ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>While Matters were in this di&s;po&s;ition abroad; the Treaty for the Union of the two Kingdoms was brought on, and managed <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Treaty for the Union of the two King|doms.</NOTE> with great Solemnity. Commi&s;&s;ions were given out for Thirty|two Per&s;ons of each Kingdom, to meet at <HI>London</HI> on the 18th of <HI>April: Somer&s;et-Hou&s;e</HI> was appointed for the place of the Treaty; the Per&s;ons, who were named to treat on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ide, were well cho&s;en: They were the mo&s;t capable of ma|naging the Treaty, and the be&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to it, of any in the Kingdom. Tho&s;e who came from <HI>Scotland,</HI> were not looked on as Men &s;o well affected to the De&s;ign: Mo&s;t of them had &s;tood out in a long and firm Oppo&s;ition to the Revolution, and to all that had been done afterwards, pur&s;uant to it. The Nomi|nation of the&s;e was fixed on, by the Dukes of <HI>Queensbury</HI> and <HI>Argyle:</HI> It was &s;aid by them, that tho' the&s;e Objections did in|deed lie again&s;t them, yet they had &s;uch an Intere&s;t in <HI>Scotland,</HI> that the engaging them to be cordially for the Union, would be a great means to get it agreed to, in the Parliament there: The <HI>Scotch</HI> had got among them the Notion of a Foederal Union, like that of the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> or of the Cantons in <HI>Switzerland:</HI> But the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> re&s;olved to lo&s;e no time, in the examining or di&s;cu&s;|&s;ing of that Project, for this rea&s;on, be&s;ides many others, that as long as the two Nations had two different Parliaments, they could break that Union when&s;oever they plea&s;ed; for each Nation would follow their own Parliament: The De&s;ign was now to &s;ettle a la&s;ting and indi&s;&s;oluble Union between the Kingdoms, therefore they re&s;olved to treat only, about an incorporating Union, that &s;hould put an end to all Di&s;tinctions, and unite all their In|tere&s;ts: &s;o they at la&s;t entered upon the Scheme of an entire Union.</P>
<P>But now to look again into our Affairs abroad: The <HI>French</HI> &s;eemed to have laid the De&s;ign of their Campaign &s;o well, that it had every where a formidable Appearance: And if the Execution had an&s;wered their Scheme, it would have proved as glorious, as it was in the Conclu&s;ion fatal to them. They reckoned the taking of <HI>Barcelona</HI> and <HI>Turin</HI> &s;ure: And by the&s;e, they thought the War, both in <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> would be &s;oon brought to
<PB N="447" REF="473">
an end: They Knew they would be &s;uperiour to any Force, that the Prince of <HI>Baden</HI> could bring together, on the Upper <HI>Rhine;</HI> and they intended to have a great Army in <HI>Flanders,</HI> where they knew our chief Strength would be, to act as occa&s;ion or their other Affairs &s;hould require. But how well &s;oever this De&s;ign might &s;eem to be laid, it appeared Providence had ano|ther: Which was brought to bear every where, in a mo&s;t won|derful manner, and in rever&s;e to all their Views. The Steps of this, I intend to &s;et out, rather as a Meditation on the Providence of God, than as a particular Hi&s;tory of this &s;ignal Year, for which I am no way furni&s;hed: Be&s;ides that, if I were, it does not an|&s;wer my principal De&s;ign in Writing.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> lay Thirty-&s;even Days before <HI>Barcelona:</HI> Of that time, Twenty-two were &s;pent in taking <HI>Mountjoy;</HI> they &s;eemed to think there was no danger of rai&s;ing the Siege, and that therefore they might proceed as &s;lowly as they plea&s;ed: The Town was under &s;uch a Con&s;ternation, that nothing but the King's Pre&s;ence could have kept them, from capitulating, the fir&s;t Week of the Siege: There were &s;ome Mutinies rai&s;ed, and &s;ome of the Ma|gi&s;trates were killed in them: But the King came among them on all occa&s;ions, and both quieted and animated them. <HI>Stanhope</HI> wrote, after the Siege was over, (whether as a Courtier or not, I cannot tell, for he had now on him the Character of the <HI>Queen</HI>'s Envoy to King <HI>Charles)</HI> that the King went into all places of Danger, and made all about him Examples to the re&s;t, to be hard at work, and con&s;tant upon duty. After <HI>Mountjoy</HI> was taken, the Town was more pre&s;&s;ed: The Earl of <HI>Peterborough</HI> came from <HI>Valentia,</HI> and was upon the Hills, but could not give them any great A&s;&s;i&s;tance: Some few from <HI>Gironne,</HI> and other Places, got into the Town: The <HI>French</HI> Engineers performed their part, with little Skill and Succe&s;s; tho&s;e they relied mo&s;t on, happened to be killed in the beginning of the Siege. The <HI>Levant</HI> Wind was all this while &s;o &s;trong, that it was not po&s;&s;ible for <HI>Leak</HI> to come up, &s;o &s;oon as was de&s;ired, to their relief.</P>
<P>But when their Strength, as well as their Patience, was almo&s;t <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Siege of <HI>Barcelona</HI> rai&s;ed.</NOTE> quite exhau&s;ted, the Wind turned, and <HI>Leak</HI> with all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te &s;ailed to them: As &s;oon as the Count of <HI>Toulou&s;e</HI> had Intel|ligence, that he was near him, he &s;ailed back to <HI>Toulon. Te&s;&s;e,</HI> with King <HI>Philip</HI> (who was in the Camp, but was not once named in any action) continued three Days before <HI>Barcelona,</HI> after their Fleet &s;ailed away: they could then have no hopes of carrying it, unle&s;s a Storm at Sea had kept our Fleet at a di&s;tance: At la&s;t, on the fir&s;t of <HI>May</HI> O. S. the Siege was rai&s;ed, with great precipitation, and in much di&s;order: Their Camp was left
<PB N="448" REF="474">
well furni&s;hed, and the Sick and Wounded could not be car|ried off.</P>
<P>On the Day of the rai&s;ing the Siege, as the <HI>French</HI> Army was <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Eclip&s;e of the Sun.</NOTE> marching off, the Sun was eclip&s;ed, and it was total in tho&s;e Parts: It is certain that there is no weight to be laid on &s;uch things; yet the Vulgar being apt to look on them as ominous, it was cen&s;ured as a great Error in <HI>Te&s;&s;e,</HI> not to have rai&s;ed the Siege a Day &s;ooner; and that the rather, becau&s;e the King of <HI>France</HI> had made the Sun, with a Motto of <HI>Nec pluribus Impar,</HI> his Device. King <HI>Philip</HI> made all the ha&s;te he could to <HI>Perpignan,</HI> but his Army was almo&s;t quite ruined, before he got thither: There was no manner of Communication, over land, between <HI>Barcelona</HI> and <HI>Por|tugal:</HI> So the <HI>Portugueze,</HI> doubting the i&s;&s;ue of that Siege, had no mind to engage further, till they &s;aw how it ended: There|fore they ordered their Army to march a&s;ide to <HI>Ciudad Roderigo,</HI> on pretence that it was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure their Frontier, by taking <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earl of <HI>Galleay</HI> ad|vance.</NOTE> that place: It was taken after a very &s;hort Siege, and with &s;mall Re&s;i&s;tance: From thence they advanced to <HI>Salamanca.</HI> But upon the News of rai&s;ing the Siege of <HI>Barcelona,</HI> they went on towards <HI>Madrid;</HI> the Duke of <HI>Berwick</HI> only ob&s;erving their Motions, and &s;till retiring before them. King <HI>Philip</HI> went, with great expedi|tion, and a very &s;mall Train, from <HI>Perpignan</HI> to <HI>Navarre,</HI> from thence he came po&s;t to <HI>Madrid;</HI> but finding he had no Army, <NOTE PLACE="marg">King <HI>Philip</HI> cartre <HI>Ma|drid</HI> and &s;oon left it.</NOTE> that he could tru&s;t to, the Grandees being now retired, and look|ing as &s;o many dead Men; and he &s;eeing that the <HI>Portugueze</HI> were &s;till advancing, &s;ent his Queen to <HI>Burgos,</HI> and followed her in a few Days, carrying with him that which was valuable in the Palace: And it &s;eems he de&s;paired ever to return thither again, &s;ince he de&s;troyed all that could not be carried away; in which he acted a very extraordinary part, for he did &s;ome of this with his own hand; as the Gentleman, whom the Earl of <HI>Gallway</HI> &s;ent over, told me, was univer&s;ally believed in <HI>Madrid.</HI></P>
<P>The capital City being thus for&s;aken, the Earl of <HI>Gallway</HI> came to it by the end of <HI>June;</HI> he met with no re&s;i&s;tance indeed, but <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earl of <HI>Gallaway</HI> came to it, but King <HI>Charles</HI> de|laved too $word$ come $word$.</NOTE> with as little welcome: An Army of <HI>Portugueze,</HI> with a Here|tick at their head, were certainly very &s;trange &s;ights to the <HI>Ca&s;ti|lians,</HI> who retained all the Pride, without any of the Courage, of their Ance&s;tors: They thought it below them to make their Sub|mi&s;&s;ions to any, but to the King him&s;elf; and if King <HI>Charles</HI> had come thither immediately, it was believed that the entire Re|duction of <HI>Spain</HI> would have been &s;oon brought about. It is not yet certain, what made him &s;tay &s;o long as he did at <HI>Barcelona,</HI> even from the beginning of <HI>May</HI> till near the end of <HI>July.</HI> Tho&s;e about him pretended, it was not fit to go to <HI>Madrid,</HI> till he was
<PB N="449" REF="475">
well furni&s;hed with Money, to make a decent Entry: <HI>Stanhope</HI> offered to furni&s;h him with what was nece&s;&s;ary for the Journey, but could not afford a magnificent Equipage for a &s;olemn Entry. King <HI>Charles</HI> wrote a very pre&s;&s;ing Letter to the Duke of <HI>Marl|borough,</HI> &s;etting forth his Nece&s;&s;ities, and de&s;iring greater Supplies; I &s;aw this Letter, for the Duke &s;ent it over to the Lord Trea&s;u|rer: but little regard was had to it, becau&s;e it was &s;ugge&s;ted from many different hands, that the Prince of <HI>Lichten&s;tein</HI> was enrich|ing him&s;elf, and keeping his King poor. Others pretended the true cau&s;e of the Delay was a &s;ecret Amour of that King's at <HI>Bar|celona;</HI> what&s;oever the Cau&s;e of it might be, the Effects have hi|therto proved fatal: It was fir&s;t propo&s;ed, that King <HI>Charles</HI> &s;hould march thro' <HI>Valentia,</HI> as the neare&s;t and much the &s;afe&s;t way, and he came on that de&s;ign as far as <HI>Tarracona:</HI> But Advice be|ing brought him there, that the Kingdom of <HI>Arragon</HI> was in a good di&s;po&s;ition to declare for him, he was diverted from his fir&s;t Intentions, and prevailed on to go to <HI>Saragoza;</HI> where he was acknowledged by that Kingdom: but he lo&s;t much time, and more in the Reputation of his Arms, by delaying &s;o long to move to|wards <HI>Madrid:</HI> So King <HI>Philip</HI> took heart, and came back from <HI>Burgos</HI> to <HI>Madrid.</HI> The Earl of <HI>Gallway</HI> was very unea&s;y at this &s;low Motion, which King <HI>Charles</HI> made: King <HI>Philip</HI> had &s;ome more Troops &s;ent him from <HI>France,</HI> and the broken Bodies of his Army, being now brought together, he had an Army equal in Numbers to the Earl of <HI>Gallway,</HI> and &s;o he marched up to him; but &s;ince &s;o much depended on the I&s;&s;ue of an Action, the Earl of <HI>Gallway</HI> avoided it, becau&s;e he expected every day Reinforcements, to be brought up to him, both by King <HI>Charles,</HI> and by the Earl of <HI>Peterborough</HI> from <HI>Valentia:</HI> Therefore to facilitate this Conjunction, he moved towards <HI>Arragon;</HI> &s;o that <HI>Madrid</HI> was again left to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by King <HI>Philip.</HI> At la&s;t, in the beginning of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> King <HI>Charles</HI> came up, but with a very incon&s;iderable Force: A few days after, the Earl of <HI>Peterborough</HI> came al&s;o with an E&s;corte, rather than any Strength; for he had not with him above 500 Dragoons. He was now un|ea&s;y, becau&s;e he could not have the &s;upreme Command, both the Earl of <HI>Gallway</HI> and Count <HI>Noyelles</HI> being much ancienter Offi|cers, than he was. But to deliver him from the Unea&s;ine&s;s, of being commanded by them, the Queen had &s;ent him the Powers of an Amba&s;&s;ador Extraordinary; and he took that Cha|racter on him for a few Days. His complaining, &s;o much as he did, of the Prince of <HI>Lichten&s;tein</HI> and the <HI>Germans,</HI> who were &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of King <HI>Charles</HI>'s Confidence, made him very unac|ceptable to that King: So he, waiting for Orders from the Queen,
<PB N="450" REF="476">
withdrew from the Camp, and &s;ailed away in one of the Queen's Ships to <HI>Genoa.</HI> Our Fleet lay all the Summer in the <HI>Mediterranean;</HI> which obliged the <HI>French</HI> to keep theirs within <HI>Toulon. Cartagena</HI> declared for King <HI>Charles,</HI> and was &s;ecured by &s;ome of our Ships: The Fleet came before <HI>Alicant;</HI> the Sea|men landed and &s;tormed the Town; the Ca&s;tle held out &s;ome Weeks, but then it capitulated, and the Soldiers by Articles were obliged to march to <HI>Cadiz.</HI> Soon after that, our Fleet &s;ailed out of the Streights; one Squadron was &s;ent to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies;</HI> ano|ther was to lie at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> and the re&s;t were ordered home. After King <HI>Charles</HI> had joined Lord <HI>Gallway,</HI> King <HI>Philip</HI>'s Army and his looked on one another for &s;ome time, but without venturing on any Action: They were near an Equality, and both &s;ides ex|pected to be reinforced; &s;o in that uncertainty, neither &s;ide would put any thing to hazard.</P>
<P>But now I turn to another and a greater Scene: The King of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Battle of <HI>Ramellies.</HI></NOTE> <HI>France</HI> was a&s;&s;ured, that the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> would &s;tand upon &s;ome high Demands, he made to the Allies, &s;o that the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> could not have the <HI>Danes,</HI> who were about Ten or Twelve Thou&s;and, to join him for &s;ome time; and that the <HI>Pru&s;&s;ians,</HI> almo&s;t as many as the <HI>Danes,</HI> could not come up to the confederate Army, for &s;ome Weeks: So he ordered the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> and <HI>Villeroy</HI> to march up to them, and to venture on a Battle; &s;ince, without the <HI>Danes,</HI> they would have been much &s;uperior in number. The <HI>States</HI> yielded to all <HI>Denmark</HI>'s De|mands, and the Prince of <HI>Wirtemberg,</HI> who commanded their Troops, being very well affected, reckoned that all being granted, he needed not &s;tay, till he &s;ent to <HI>Denmark,</HI> nor wait for their expre&s;s Orders: But marched and joined the Army, the Day be|fore the Engagement. Some thought, that the King of <HI>France,</HI> upon the News of the Di&s;grace before <HI>Barcelona,</HI> that he might cover that, re&s;olved to put all to venture, hoping that a Victory would have &s;et all to rights; this pa&s;&s;ed generally in the World. But the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> told me, that there being only twelve Days, between the rai&s;ing of the Siege of <HI>Barcelona</HI> and this Battle, the one being on the fir&s;t of <HI>May,</HI> and the other on the twelfth, eight of which mu&s;t be allowed for the Courier to <HI>Paris,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Brabant,</HI> it &s;eemed not po&s;&s;ible to put things in the order, in which he &s;aw them, in &s;o &s;hort a time. The <HI>French</HI> left their Baggage and heavy Cannon at <HI>Judoign;</HI> and marched up to the Duke of <HI>Marlborough:</HI> He was marching to|wards them, on the &s;ame De&s;ign, for if they had not offered him Battle on the twelfth, he was re&s;olved to have attacked them on the thirteenth of <HI>May:</HI> They met near a Village called <HI>Ramellies</HI>

(not far from the <HI>Mehaigne)</HI> from whence the Battle takes its Name.</P>
<P>The Engagement was an entire one; and the Action was hot <NOTE PLACE="marg">A great Vic|tory gained.</NOTE> for two Hours; both the <HI>French Mou&s;quetaires</HI> and the <HI>Cuira&s;|&s;iers</HI> were there; the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> &s;aid, it was the be&s;t Army he ever beheld: But after two Hours, the <HI>French</HI> gave way every where, &s;o it ended in an entire Defeat. They lo&s;t both their Camp, Baggage and Artillery, as well as all that they had left in <HI>Judoign;</HI> and in all po&s;&s;ible Confu&s;ion, they pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Dyle;</HI> our Men pur&s;uing, till it was dark. The Duke of <HI>Marl|borough</HI> &s;aid to me, the <HI>French</HI> Army look'd the be&s;t of any he had ever &s;een: But that their Officers did not do their part, nor &s;hew the Courage, that had appeared among them on other Oc|ca&s;ions. And when I asked him the difference, between the Actions at <HI>Hock&s;tedt</HI> and at <HI>Ramellies;</HI> he &s;aid, the fir&s;t Battle la&s;ted be|tween &s;even and eight Hours, and we lo&s;t above 12000 Men in it; whereas the &s;econd la&s;ted not above two Hours, and we lo&s;t not above 2500 Men. Orders were pre&s;ently &s;ent to the great Cities, to draw the Garri&s;ons out of them, that &s;o the <HI>French</HI> might have again the Face of an Army: For their Killed, their De&s;erters, and their Pri&s;oners, on this great Day, were above 20000 Men. The Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> lo&s;t no time, but fol|lowed them clo&s;e: <HI>Louvain, Mechlin,</HI> and <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> &s;ubmitted, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>Brabant</HI> reduced.</NOTE> be&s;ides many le&s;&s;er Places; <HI>Antwerp</HI> made a &s;hew of &s;tanding out, but &s;oon followed the Example of the re&s;t; <HI>Ghendt</HI> and <HI>Bruges</HI> did the &s;ame: in all the&s;e King <HI>Charles</HI> was proclaimed. Upon this unexpected Rapidity of Succe&s;s, the Duke of <HI>Marlbo|rough</HI> went to the <HI>Hague,</HI> to concert Mea&s;ures with the <HI>States,</HI> where he &s;taid but few Days; for they agreed to every thing he propo&s;ed, and &s;ent him back with full Powers: The fir&s;t thing he undertook was the Siege of <HI>O&s;tend,</HI> a Place famous for its long Siege in the la&s;t Age: The Natives of the Place were di&s;po|&s;ed <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>O&s;tend</HI> and <HI>Menin</HI> taken.</NOTE> to return to the <HI>Au&s;trian</HI> Family, and the <HI>French,</HI> that were in it, had &s;o lo&s;t all Heart and Spirit, that they made not the Re|&s;i&s;tance, that was looked for: In ten Days, after they &s;ate down before it, and within four Days after the Batteries were fini&s;hed, they capitulated. From t$ence the Confederates went to <HI>Menin,</HI> which was e&s;teemed the be&s;t fini&s;hed Fortification, in all tho&s;e Parts: It was built after the Peace of <HI>Nimeguen;</HI> nothing that Art could contrive was wanting, to render it impregnable; and it was defended by a Garri&s;on of 6000 Men, &s;o that many thought it was too bold an Undertaking, to &s;it down before it. The <HI>French</HI> Army was become con&s;iderable, by great Detachments brought from the <HI>Upper Rhine;</HI> where Marc&s;chal <HI>Villars</HI> was
<PB N="452" REF="478">
&s;o far &s;uperior to the <HI>Germans,</HI> that, if it had not been for this Revul&s;ion of his Forces, the Circles of <HI>Suabia</HI> and <HI>Franconia</HI> would have been much expo&s;ed to Pillage and Contribution.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Vendome</HI>'s Conduct in <HI>Italy</HI> had &s;o rai&s;ed his <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of <HI>Vendome</HI> commanded in <HI>Flanders.</HI></NOTE> Character, that he was thought the only Man, fit to be at the Head of the Army in <HI>Flanders:</HI> &s;o he was &s;ent for, and had that Command given him, with a very high Complement, which was very injurious to the other Officers, &s;ince he was declared to be the &s;ingle Man, on whom <HI>France</HI> could depend, and by whom it could be protected, in that Extremity. The Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI> was &s;ent to command in <HI>Italy,</HI> and Mare&s;chal <HI>Mar&s;in</HI> was &s;ent with him to a&s;&s;i&s;t, or rather in reality to govern him: And &s;o ob&s;ti|nately was the King of <HI>France</HI> &s;et, on pur&s;uing his fir&s;t De&s;igns, that notwith&s;tanding his Di&s;graces both in <HI>Spain</HI> and in the <HI>Ne|therlands,</HI> yet (&s;ince he had ordered all the Preparations for the Siege of <HI>Turin)</HI> he would not de&s;i&s;t from that Attempt, but or|dered it to be pur&s;ued, with all po&s;&s;ible Vigour. The Siege of <HI>Menin</HI> was, in the mean while, carried on &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully, that the Trenches were opened on the 24th of <HI>July,</HI> and the Batte|ries were fini&s;hed on the 29th: and they pre&s;&s;ed the Place &s;o warmly, that they capitulated on the 11th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> and march'd out on the 14th, being St. <HI>Lewis</HI>'s Day; 4000 Men march'd out of the Place.</P>
<P>It &s;eemed &s;trange, that a Garri&s;on, which was &s;till &s;o nume|rous, &s;hould give up, in &s;o &s;hort a time, a Place that was both &s;o &s;trong and &s;o well furni&s;hed: But as the <HI>French</HI> were much &s;unk, &s;o the Allies were now become very expert at carrying on of Sieges; and &s;pared no co&s;t that was nece&s;&s;ary for di&s;patch. <HI>Dendermonde</HI> had been, for &s;ome Weeks, under a Blockade: this, the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> ordered to be turned into a formal Siege. The Place was &s;o &s;urrounded with Water, that the King of <HI>France,</HI> having once begun a Siege there, was forced to rai&s;e <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dender|monde</HI> and <HI>Aeth</HI> taken.</NOTE> it; yet it was now &s;o pre&s;&s;ed, that the Garri&s;on offered to capitu|late, but the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> would give them no other Terms, but tho&s;e of being Pri&s;oners of War, to which they were forced to &s;ubmit. <HI>Aeth</HI> was next inve&s;ted, it lay &s;o inconveniently between <HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>Brabant,</HI> that it was nece&s;&s;ary to clear that Communication, and to deliver <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> from the Danger of that Neighbourhood: In a fortnight's time, it was al&s;o obliged to ca|pitulate, and the Garri&s;on were made Pri&s;oners of War.</P>
<P>During tho&s;e Sieges, the Duke of <HI>Vendome,</HI> having fixed him|&s;elf in a Camp, that could not be forced, did not think fit to give the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> any Di&s;turbance; while he lay with his Army covering the Sieges: The <HI>French</HI> were jealous of
<PB N="453" REF="479">
the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI>'s Heat, and tho' he de&s;ired to command an Army apart, yet it was not thought fit to divide their Forces, tho' now grown to be very numerous. De&s;erters &s;aid, the Pan|nick was &s;till &s;o great in the Army, that there was no appearance of their venturing on any Action: <HI>Paris</HI> it &s;elf was under a high Con&s;ternation, and tho' the King carried his Misfortunes with an appearance of Calmne&s;s and Compo&s;ure, yet he was often let blood, which was thought an indication of a great Commotion within; and this was no doubt the greater, becau&s;e it was &s;o much di&s;gui&s;ed. No News was talked of at that Court; all was &s;ilent and &s;olemn; &s;o that even the Dutche&s;s Dowager of <HI>Orleans</HI> knew not the true State of their Affairs; which made her write to her Aunt, the Electore&s;s of <HI>Hanover,</HI> to learn News of her.</P>
<P>There was another Alarm given them, which heighten'd the <NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;igns for a De&s;cent in <HI>France.</HI></NOTE> Di&s;order they were in: The <HI>Queen</HI> and the <HI>States</HI> formed a De|&s;ign of a De&s;cent in <HI>France,</HI> with an Army of about 10000 Foot and 1200 Hor&s;e. The Earl of <HI>Rivers</HI> commanded the Land-Army, as <HI>Shovell</HI> did a Royal Fleet, that was to convoy them, and to &s;ecure their Landing; it was to be near <HI>Bourdeaux:</HI> but the Secret was then &s;o well kept, that the <HI>French</HI> could not pene|trate into it; &s;o the Alarm was general. It put all the maritime Counties of <HI>France</HI> to a va&s;t charge, and under di&s;mal apprehen|&s;ions: Officers were &s;ent from the Court to exerci&s;e them; but they &s;aw what their Militia was, and that was all their defence. I have one of the Manife&s;to's, that the Earl of <HI>Rivers</HI> was ordered to publi&s;h, upon his landing: He declared by it, that he was come neither to pillage the Country, nor to conquer any part of it; He came only to re&s;tore the People to their Liberties, and to have A&s;&s;emblies of the <HI>States,</HI> as they had anciently, and to re|&s;tore the <HI>Edicts</HI> to the Prote&s;tants; He promi&s;ed protection to all that &s;hould come in to him. The Troops were all put aboard at <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> in the beginning of <HI>July,</HI> but they were kept in our Ports by contrary Winds, till the beginning of <HI>October:</HI> The De|&s;ign on <HI>France</HI> was then laid a&s;ide; it was too late in the Year, for the Fleet to &s;ail into the Bay of <HI>Bi&s;cay,</HI> and to lie there, for any con&s;iderable time, in that Sea&s;on: The Reduction of <HI>Spain</HI> was of the greate&s;t importance to us; &s;o new Orders were &s;ent them to &s;ail fir&s;t to <HI>Lisbon,</HI> and there to take &s;uch Mea&s;ures, as the State of the Affairs of <HI>Spain</HI> &s;hould require.</P>
<P>The Siege of <HI>Turin</HI> was begun in <HI>May,</HI> and was continued till <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Siege of <HI>Turin.</HI></NOTE> the beginning of <HI>September:</HI> There was a &s;trong Garri&s;on with|in it, and it was well furni&s;hed, both with Provi&s;ions and Ammu|nition. The Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> put all to the hazard: He &s;ent his Dutche&s;s with his Children to <HI>Genoa;</HI> and him&s;elf, with a Body
<PB N="454" REF="480">
of 3000 Hor&s;e, was moving about <HI>Turin,</HI> from Valley to Valley, till that Body was much dimini&s;hed: for he was, as it were, hun|ted from place to place, by the Duke of <HI>Feuillade,</HI> who com|manded in the Siege, and drove the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> before him: &s;o that all hope of Relief lay in Prince <HI>Eugene.</HI> The Garri&s;on made a noble re&s;i&s;tance, and maintained their Outworks long; they blew up many Mines, and di&s;puted every Inch of Ground, with great Re&s;olution: They lo&s;t about 6000 Men, who were either killed, or had de&s;erted during the Siege; and their Powder was at la&s;t &s;o &s;pent, that they mu&s;t have capitulated within a day or two, if they had not been relieved. The Siege co&s;t the <HI>French</HI> very dear; they were often forced to change their Attacks, and lo&s;t about 14000 Men before the Place; for they were frequently beat from the Po&s;ts, that they had gain'd.</P>
<P>Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> made all the ha&s;te, he could to their relief: The <NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince <HI>Eu|gene</HI> mar|ches to rai&s;e it.</NOTE> Court of <HI>Vienna</HI> had not given due Orders, as they had under|taken, for the Provi&s;ion of the Troops, that were to march thro' their Country, to join him: This occa&s;ioned many Complaints, and &s;ome Delay. The truth was, that Court was &s;o much &s;et on the Reduction of <HI>Hungary,</HI> that all other things were much neg|lected, while that alone &s;eemed to po&s;&s;e&s;s them. A Treaty was &s;et on foot, with the Malecontents there, by the Mediation of <HI>England</HI> and of the <HI>States;</HI> a Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms was agreed to, for two Months: All that belonged to that Court were very unea&s;y, while that continued; they had &s;hared among them the Confi&s;cations of all the great E&s;tates in <HI>Hungary,</HI> and they &s;aw, that if a Peace was made, all the&s;e would be vacated, and the E&s;tates would be re&s;tored to their former Owners: &s;o they took all po&s;&s;ible means to traver&s;e the Negotiation, and to inflame the Emperor. There &s;eemed to be &s;ome probability, of bringing things to a Settlement, but that could not be brought to any conclu&s;ion, during the Term of the Ce&s;&s;ation; when that was lap&s;ed, the Emperor could not be prevailed on to renew it: He recalled his Troops from the Upper <HI>Rhine,</HI> tho' that was contrary to all his Agreements with the Empire. Notwith&s;tanding all this ill Management of the Court of <HI>Vienna,</HI> Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> got together the greate&s;t part of tho&s;e Troops, that he expected in the <HI>Verone&s;e,</HI> before the end of <HI>June:</HI> They were not yet all come up, but he, believing him|&s;elf &s;trong enough, re&s;olved to advance; and he left the Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e,</HI> with a Body to receive the re&s;t, and by them to force a Diver&s;ion, while he &s;hould be going on. The Duke of <HI>Vendome</HI> had taken care of all the Fords of the <HI>Adige,</HI> the <HI>Mincio,</HI> and the <HI>Oglio;</HI> and had ca&s;t up &s;uch Lines and Entrenchments every where, that he had a&s;&s;ured the Court of <HI>France,</HI> it was not
<PB N="455" REF="481">
po&s;&s;ible for Prince <HI>Eugene,</HI> to break thro' all that Oppo&s;ition, at lea&s;t to do it, in any time to relieve <HI>Turin.</HI> By this time the Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI> was come to take the Army, out of <HI>Vendome</HI>'s hands: but before that Duke had left it, they &s;aw that he had reckon'd wrong, in all tho&s;e Hopes, he had given the Court of <HI>France,</HI> of &s;topping Prince <HI>Eugene</HI>'s March. For, in the beginning of <HI>July,</HI> he &s;ent a few Battalions, over one of the Fords of the <HI>Adige,</HI> where the <HI>French</HI> were well po&s;ted, and double their number; yet they ran away with &s;uch precipitation, that they left every thing behind them: Upon that, Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Adige,</HI> with his whole Army, and the <HI>French,</HI> in a Con&s;ternation, retired behind the <HI>Mincio.</HI> After this, Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> &s;urprized the <HI>French</HI> with a Motion, that they had not looked for, nor prepared again&s;t, for he pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Po;</HI> the Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI> followed him, but de|clined an Engagement; whereupon Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> wrote to the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> that he felt the Effects of the Battle of <HI>Ramellies,</HI> even in <HI>Italy,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> &s;eeming to be every where di&s;pirited with their Misfortunes. Prince <HI>Eugene,</HI> marching nearer the <HI>Appenines,</HI> had gained &s;ome Days March of the Duke of <HI>Orleans;</HI> upon which, that Duke repa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Po,</HI> and ad|vanced with &s;uch ha&s;te towards <HI>Turin,</HI> that he took no care of the Pa&s;s at <HI>Stradella,</HI> which might have been kept and di&s;puted for &s;ome Days: Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> found no Oppo&s;ition there; nor did he meet with any other difficulty, but from the length of the March, and the heat of the Sea&s;on; for he was in motion all the Months of <HI>July</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>In the Beginning of <HI>September,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> joined him, with the &s;mall Remnants of his Army, and they ha&s;ted on to <HI>Turin.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI> had got thither before them, and the place was now reduced to the la&s;t Extremities; the Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> with mo&s;t of the chief Officers, were for marching out of the Trenches; <HI>Mar&s;in</HI> was of another mind, and when he found it hard to maintain his Opinion, he produced po&s;itive Or|ders for it, which put an end to the Debate. The Duke of <HI>Sa|voy</HI> &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of attacking them, in their Trenches; his Army con&s;i&s;ted of 28000 Men, but they were good Troops; the <HI>French</HI> were above 40000, and in a well fortified Camp; yet after two Hours Re&s;i&s;tance, the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> broke thro', and then there was a great de&s;truction; the <HI>French</HI> flying in much di&s;order, and leaving a va&s;t Trea&s;ure in their Camp, be&s;ides great Stores of Provi&s;ions, Ammunition and Artillery. It was &s;o en|tire <NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>French</HI> Army rout|ed, and the Siege rai&s;ed.</NOTE> a Defeat, that not above 1600 Men, of that great Army, got off in a Body; and they made all the ha&s;te they could into <HI>Dau|phiny.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> went into <HI>Turin;</HI> where it may be
<PB N="456" REF="482">
ea&s;ily imagined, he was received with much Joy; the Garri&s;on, for want of Powder, was not in a condition to make a Sally on the <HI>French,</HI> while he attack'd them; the <HI>French</HI> were pur&s;ued as far, as Men, wearied with &s;uch an Action, could follow them, and many Pri&s;oners were taken. The Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> tho' he lo&s;t the Day, yet gave great Demon&s;trations of Courage, and re|ceived &s;everal Wounds: Mare&s;chal <HI>Mar&s;in</HI> fell into the Enemies hands, but died of his Wounds in a few Hours; and upon him all the Errors of this di&s;mal Day were ca&s;t, tho' the heavie&s;t part of the Load fell on <HI>Chamillard,</HI> who was then in the &s;upreme degree of favour at Court, and was entirely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Madam <HI>Maintenon</HI>'s Confidence. <HI>Feuillade</HI> had married his Daughter, and in order to the advancing him, he had the Command of this Siege given him, which was thus ob&s;tinately pur&s;ued, till it ended in this fatal manner. The Ob&s;tinacy continued, for the King &s;ent Orders, for a Month together, to the Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> to march back into <HI>Piedmont,</HI> when it was ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible; yet repeated Orders were &s;ent, and the rea&s;on of this was under|&s;tood afterwards: Madam <HI>Maintenon</HI> (it &s;eems) took that care of the King's Health and Humour, that &s;he did not &s;uffer the ill &s;tate of his Affairs to be fully told him: He, all that while, was made believe, that the Siege was only rai&s;ed, upon the Advance of Prince <HI>Eugene</HI>'s Army; and knew not that his own was de|feated and ruined. I am not enough ver&s;ed in Military Affairs, to offer any Judgment upon that point, whether they did well or ill, not to go out of their Camp to fight: It is certain, that the Fight was more di&s;orderly, and the Lo&s;s was much greater, by rea&s;on of their lying, within their Lines: In this I have known Men of the Trade of different Opinions.</P>
<P>While this was done at <HI>Turin,</HI> the Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e</HI> advanced to the <HI>Mincio,</HI> which the <HI>French</HI> abandoned; but as he went to take <HI>Ca&s;tiglione, Medavi,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> General, &s;urprized him, and cut off about 2000 of his Men; upon which he was forced to re|tire to the <HI>Adige.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> magnified this exce&s;&s;ively, hoping with the noi&s;e they made about it, to ballance their real Lo&s;s at <HI>Turin.</HI> The Prince of <HI>Vaudemont,</HI> upon the News from <HI>Turin,</HI> left the City of <HI>Milan,</HI> and retired, with the &s;mall Force he had, to <HI>Cremona:</HI> The Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> and Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> marched, with all ha&s;te, into the <HI>Milaneze:</HI> The City of <HI>Milan</HI> was opened to them; but the Cittadel and &s;ome &s;trong Places, that had Gar|ri&s;ons in them, &s;tood out &s;ome time; yet Place after Place capi|tulated, &s;o that it was vi&s;ible, all would quickly fall into their hands.</P>
<P>Such a Succe&s;&s;ion of eminent Misfortunes, in one Campaign, and in &s;o many different Places, was without example: It made
<PB N="457" REF="483">
all People conclude, that the time was come, in which the Per|fidy, the Tyranny, and the Cruelty of that King's long and bloody Reign, was now to be repayed him, with the &s;ame &s;evere mea&s;ure, with which he had formerly treated others: But the Se|crets of God are not to be too boldly pried into, till he is plea&s;ed to di&s;play them to us more openly. It is certainly a Year, that de&s;erves to be long and much remembred.</P>
<P>In the end of the Campaign, in which <HI>Poland</HI> had been har|ra&s;&s;ed, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of <HI>$span$</HI> ar|ched into <HI>Saxony.</HI></NOTE> with the continuance of the War, but without any great Action; the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> &s;eeing that King <HI>Angu&s;tus</HI> &s;up|ported his Affairs in <HI>Poland,</HI> by the Supplies both of Men and Money, that he drew from his Electorate, re&s;olved to &s;top that Re&s;&s;ource: So he marched thro' <HI>Sile&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Lu&s;atia</HI> into <HI>Saxony.</HI> He quickly made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of an open Country, that was looking for no &s;uch Inva&s;ion, and was in no &s;ort prepared for it, and had few &s;trong Places in it, capable of any Re&s;i&s;tance: The rich Town of <HI>Leip$ick</HI> and all the re&s;t of the Country was, with|out any Oppo&s;ition, put under Contribution. All the Empire was alarmed at this; it was at fir&s;t apprehended, that it was &s;et on by the <HI>French</HI> Councils, to rai&s;e a new War in <HI>Germany,</HI> and to put the North all in a flame. The King of <HI>Sweden</HI> gave it out, that he had no de&s;ign to give any di&s;turbance to the Empire: That he intended, by this March, only to bring the War of <HI>Poland</HI> to a &s;peedy conclu&s;ion; and it was rea&s;onable to believe, that &s;uch an unlooked for Incident would &s;oon bring that War to a Cri&s;is.</P>
<P>This was the State of our Affairs abroad, in this glorious and <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Treaty of Union con|cluded.</NOTE> ever-memorable Year. At home, another matter of great con&s;e|quence was put in a good and promi&s;ing method: The Commi&s;|&s;ioners of both Kingdoms &s;ate clo&s;e in a Treaty, till about the middle of <HI>July;</HI> in conclu&s;ion, they prepared a compleat Scheme of an entire Union of both Nations: Some Particulars being only referred, to be &s;ettled by their Parliaments re&s;pectively. When every thing was agreed to, they pre&s;ented one Copy of the Treaty to the Queen, and each &s;ide had a Copy, to be pre&s;ented to their re&s;pective Parliament, all the three Copies being &s;igned by the Commi&s;&s;ioners of both Kingdoms: It was re&s;olved to lay the mat|ter, fir&s;t before the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> becau&s;e it was appre|hended, that it would meet with the greate&s;t oppo&s;ition there.</P>
<P>The Union of the two Kingdoms was a Work, of which many had quite de&s;paired, in which number I was one; and tho&s;e who entertained better hopes, thought it mu&s;t have run out into a long Negotiation for &s;everal Years: but beyond all Mens expectation, it was begun and fini&s;hed, within the Compa&s;s of One.

Commi&s;&s;ioners, brought up from <HI>Scotland,</HI> for the Treaty, were &s;o &s;trangely cho&s;en (the far greater number having continued in an Oppo&s;ition to the Government, ever &s;ince the Revolution) <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Articles of the Union.</NOTE> that from thence many concluded, that it was not &s;incerely de|&s;igned by the Mini&s;try, when they &s;aw &s;uch a Nomination. This was a piece of the Earl of <HI>Stair</HI>'s Cunning, who did heartily pro|mote the De&s;ign: He then thought, that if &s;uch a number of tho&s;e, who were looked on as <HI>Jacobites,</HI> and were popular Men on that account, among the Di&s;affected there, could be &s;o wrought on, as to be engaged in the Affair, the Work would be much the ea&s;ier, when laid before the Parliament of <HI>Scotland:</HI> And in this, the Event &s;hewed, that he took right Mea&s;ures. The Lord <HI>Somers</HI> had the chief hand, in projecting the Scheme of the Union, into which, all the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation went very ea&s;ily: The Advantages, that were offered to <HI>Scotland,</HI> in the whole Frame of it, were &s;o great, and &s;o vi&s;ible, that no|thing but the Con&s;ideration of the Safety, that was to be procured by it to <HI>England,</HI> could have brought the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to agree to a Project, that, in every Branch of it, was much more favourable to the <HI>Scotch</HI> Nation.</P>
<P>They were to bear le&s;s, than the fortieth part of the Publick Taxes: When four Shillings in the Pound was levied in <HI>England,</HI> which amounted to two Millions, <HI>Scotland</HI> was only to be taxed at 48000 Pounds, which was eight Months A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment: They had been accu&s;tomed for &s;ome Years to pay this, and they &s;aid it was all that the Nation could bear. It is held a Maxim, that in the framing of a Government, a Proportion ought to be ob|&s;erved, between the Share in the Legi&s;lature, and the Burden to be born; yet in return of the fortieth part of the Burden, they offer'd the <HI>Scotch</HI> near the eleventh part of the Legi&s;lature: For the Peers of <HI>Scotland</HI> were to be repre&s;ented, by &s;ixteen Peers in the Hou&s;e of Lords, and the Commons, by forty five Members in the Hou&s;e of Commons; and the&s;e were to be cho&s;en, according to the Methods, to be &s;ettled in the Parliament of <HI>Scotland.</HI> And &s;ince <HI>Scotland</HI> was to pay Cu&s;toms and Exci&s;es, on the &s;ame foot with <HI>England,</HI> and was to bear a &s;hare in paying much of the Debt, <HI>England</HI> had contracted during the War; 398000 Pounds was to be rai&s;ed in <HI>England,</HI> and &s;ent into <HI>Scotland,</HI> as an Equi|valent for that; and that was to be applied to the recoining the Money, that all might be of one Denomination and Standard, and to paying the Publick Debts of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and repaying, to their <HI>African</HI> Company, all their Lo&s;&s;es with Intere&s;t; upon which that Company was to be di&s;&s;olved; and the Over-plus of the Equivalent was to be applied, to the Encouragement of Manu|factures.

Trade was to be free all over the I&s;land, and to the Plantations; private Rights were to be pre&s;erved; and the Judi|catories and Laws of <HI>Scotland</HI> were &s;till to be continued: But all was put, for the future, under the Regulation of the Parliament of <HI>Great Britain;</HI> the two Nations now were to be one King|dom, under the &s;ame Succe&s;&s;ion to the Crown, and united in one Parliament. There was no Provi&s;ion made in this Treaty, with relation to Religion: For in the Acts of Parliament, in both Kingdoms, that empowered the Queen to name Commi&s;&s;ioners, there was an expre&s;s Limitation, that they &s;hould not treat of tho&s;e Matters.</P>
<P>This was the Sub&s;tance of the Articles of the Treaty, which <NOTE PLACE="marg">Debated long in the Parliament of <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> being laid before the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> met with great Op|po&s;ition there. It was vi&s;ible, that the Nobility of that Kingdom &s;uffered a great Diminution by it; for tho' it was agreed, that they &s;hould enjoy all the other Privileges of the Peers of <HI>England,</HI> yet the greate&s;t of them all, which was the Voting in the Hou&s;e of Lords, was re&s;trained to Sixteen, to be elected by the re&s;t at every new Parliament; yet there was a greater Majority of the Nobility, that concurred in Voting for the Union, than in the other States of that Kingdom. The Commi&s;&s;ioners from the Shires and Boroughs, were almo&s;t equally divided, tho' it was evident they were to be the chief Gainers by it; among the&s;e the Union was agreed to, by a very &s;mall Majority: It was the No|bility, that in every Vote turned the Scale for the Union: they were &s;everely reflected on, by tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed it; it was &s;aid, many of them were bought off, to &s;ell their Country and their Birth-right: All tho&s;e, who adhered inflexibly to the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Intere&s;t, oppo&s;ed every Step that was made, with great Vehe|mence; for they &s;aw that the Union &s;truck at the Root of all their Views and De&s;igns, for a new Revolution. Yet the&s;e could not have rai&s;ed or maintained &s;o great an Oppo&s;ition, as was now made; if the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> had not been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a Jea|lou&s;y, that the con&s;equence of this Union would be, the Change of Church-Government among them, and that they would be &s;wallowed up by the Church of <HI>England.</HI> This took &s;uch root in many, that no A&s;&s;urances, that were offered, could remove their Fears: It was infu&s;ed in them chiefly by the old Dutche&s;s of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> who had great credit with them: And it was &s;ug|ge&s;ted, that &s;he, and her Son, had particular Views, as hoping, that if <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hould continue a &s;eparated Kingdom, the Crown might come into their Family, they being the next in Blood, af|ter King <HI>James</HI>'s Po&s;terity. The Infu&s;ion of &s;uch Apprehen&s;ions, had a great effect on the main Body of that Party, who could
<PB N="460" REF="486">
&s;carce be brought to hearken, but never to accept of the Offers, that were made for &s;ecuring their <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Government. A great Part of the Gentry of that Kingdom, who had been oft in <HI>England,</HI> and had ob&s;erved the Protection, that all Men had from a Hou&s;e of Commons, and the Security that it procured, again&s;t partial Judges, and a violent Mini&s;try, entred into the De&s;ign with great Zeal. The opening a free Trade, not only with <HI>England,</HI> but with the Plantations, and the Protection of the Fleet of <HI>England,</HI> drew in tho&s;e who under&s;tood the&s;e Mat|ters, and &s;aw there was no other way in view, to make the Na|tion rich and con&s;iderable. Tho&s;e who had engaged far into the De&s;ign of <HI>Darien,</HI> and were great Lo&s;ers by it, &s;aw now an ho|nourable way to be reimbur&s;ed, which made them wi&s;h well to the Union, and promote it. But that which advanced the De&s;ign mo&s;t effectually, and without which, it could not have &s;ucceeded, was, that a con&s;iderable number of Noblemen and Gentlemen, who were in no Engagements with the Court (on the contrary, they had been di&s;obliged, and turned out of great Po&s;ts, and &s;ome very lately) declared for it. The&s;e kept them&s;elves very clo&s;e and united, and &s;eemed to have no other Intere&s;t, but that of their Country, and were for that rea&s;on called the <HI>Squadrone:</HI> The chief of the&s;e were, the Marque&s;s of <HI>Tweedale,</HI> the Earls of <HI>Rothes, Roxburgh, Hadington,</HI> and <HI>Marchmont;</HI> they were in great credit, becau&s;e they had no vi&s;ible Bia&s;s on their Minds; ill u&s;age had provoked them rather to oppo&s;e the Mini&s;try, than to concur in any thing, where the chief Honour would be car|ried away by others. When they were &s;poke to by the Mini&s;try, they an&s;wered coldly, and with great Re&s;erves, &s;o it was expected they would have concurred in the Oppo&s;ition, and they being between twenty and thirty in number, if they had &s;et them&s;elves again&s;t the Union, the De&s;ign mu&s;t have mi&s;carried. But they continued &s;till &s;ilent, till the fir&s;t Divi&s;ion of the Hou&s;e obliged them to declare, and then, they not only joined in it, but pro|moted it effectually, and with Zeal: There were great and long Debates, managed on the &s;ide of the Union, by the Earls of <HI>Seafield</HI> and <HI>Stair</HI> for the Mini&s;try, and of the <HI>Squadrone</HI> by the Earl of <HI>Roxburgh</HI> and <HI>Marchmont;</HI> and again&s;t it by the Dukes of <HI>Hamilton</HI> and <HI>Athol</HI> and the Marque&s;s of <HI>Annandale.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Athol</HI> was believed to be in a foreign Corre&s;pondence, and was much &s;et on violent methods: Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> managed the Debate with great Vehemence, but was again&s;t all de&s;perate Motions: He had much to lo&s;e, and was re&s;olved not to venture all, with tho&s;e who &s;ug|ge&s;ted the nece&s;&s;ity of running, in the old <HI>Scotch</HI> way, to Ex|tremities. The Topicks, from which the Arguments again&s;t the
<PB N="461" REF="487">
Union were drawn, were the Antiquity and Dignity of their Kingdom, which was offered to be given up, and &s;old: They were departing from an Independent State, and going to &s;ink into a Dependence on <HI>England;</HI> what Conditions &s;oever might be now &s;peciou&s;ly offered, as a Security to them, they could not expect that they &s;hould be adhered to, or religiou&s;ly maintained in a Parliament, where &s;ixteen Peers and forty five Commoners could not hold the ballance, again&s;t above an hundred Peers and five hundred and thirteen Commoners. <HI>Scotland</HI> would be no more con&s;idered as formerly by foreign Princes and States: Their Peers would be precarious and elective: They magnified their Crown, with the other Regalia &s;o much, that &s;ince the Nation &s;eemed re|&s;olved never to &s;uffer them to be carried away, it was provided, in a new Clau&s;e added to the Articles, that the&s;e &s;hould &s;till re|main within the Kingdom. They in&s;i&s;ted mo&s;t vehemently on the Danger, that the Con&s;titution of their Church mu&s;t be in, when all &s;hould be under the power of a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament: This was pre&s;&s;ed with Fury by &s;ome, who were known to be the mo&s;t violent Enemies to <HI>Presbytery,</HI> of any in that Nation: but it was done on de&s;ign, to inflame that Body of Men by tho&s;e Apprehen&s;ions, and &s;o to engage them to per&s;i&s;t in their Oppo&s;ition. To allay that Heat, after the general Vote was carried for the Union, be|fore they entered on the Con&s;ideration of the particular Articles, an Act was prepared for &s;ecuring the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Government: by which it was declared to be the only Government of that Church, unalterable in all &s;ucceeding Times, and the maintain|ing it was declared to be a fundamental and e&s;&s;ential Article and Condition of the Union; and this Act was to be made a part of the Act for the Union, which, in the Con&s;equence of that, was to be ratified by another Act of Parliament in <HI>England.</HI> Thus tho&s;e, who were the greate&s;t Enemies to <HI>Presbytery,</HI> of any in the Nation, rai&s;ed the Clamour of the Danger that Form of Govern|ment would be in, if the Union went on, to &s;uch a heighth, that by their means this Act was carried, as far as any human Law could go, for their Security: For by this, they had, not only all the Security that their own Parliament could give them, but they were to have the Faith and Authority of the Parliament of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> it being, in the Stipulation, made an e&s;&s;ential Condition of the Union: The carrying this Matter &s;o far, was done in hopes, that the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> would never be brought to pa&s;s it. This Act was pa&s;&s;ed, and it gave an entire Satisfaction to tho&s;e, who were di&s;po&s;ed to receive any; but nothing could &s;a|tisfy Men, who made u&s;e of this, only to inflame others. Tho&s;e, who oppo&s;ed the Union, finding the Majority was again&s;t them,
<PB N="462" REF="488">
&s;tudied to rai&s;e a Storm without doors, to frighten them: A Set of Addre&s;&s;es again&s;t the Union were &s;ent round all the Countries, in which, tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed it, had any Intere&s;t: There came up many of the&s;e, in the Name of Counties and Burroughs, and at la&s;t, from Pari&s;hes: This made &s;ome Noi&s;e abroad, but was very little con&s;idered there, when it was known, by who&s;e Arts and Practices they were procured. When this appeared to have little effect, Pains were taken to animate the Rabble to violent At|tempts, both at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and at <HI>Gla&s;gow.</HI> Sir <HI>Patrick John&s;ton</HI> Lord Provo&s;t of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> had been one of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, and had concurred heartily in the De&s;ign: A great Multitude ga|thered about his Hou&s;e, and were forcing the Doors on de&s;ign, as was believed, to murder him; but Guards came and di&s;per&s;ed them. Upon this Attempt, the Privy-Council &s;et out a Procla|mation again&s;t all &s;uch Riots, and gave orders for quartering the Guards within the Town: But to &s;hew, that this was not intended to over-awe the Parliament, the whole Matter was laid before them, and the Proceedings of the Privy-Council were approved. No other violent Attempt was made after this, but the Body of the People &s;hewed &s;o much Sullenne&s;s, that probably, had any Per|&s;on of Authority once kindled the Fire, they &s;eemed to be of &s;uch combu&s;tible Matter, that the Union might have ca&s;t that Nation into great Convul&s;ions. The&s;e things made great Impre&s;|&s;ions on the Duke of <HI>Queensbury,</HI> and on &s;ome about him: He de&s;paired of &s;ucceeding, and he apprehended his Per&s;on might be in danger: One about him wrote to my Lord Trea&s;urer, re|pre&s;enting the ill Temper the Nation was generally in, and moved for an Adjournment, that &s;o with the help of &s;ome Time and good Management, tho&s;e Difficulties, which &s;eemed then in&s;upe|rable, might be conquered. The Lord Trea&s;urer told me, his An&s;wer was, that a delay was, upon the Matter, laying the whole De&s;ign a&s;ide; Orders were given, both in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> to have Troops ready upon call; and if it was nece&s;&s;ary, more Forces &s;hould be ordered from <HI>Flanders:</HI> The <HI>French</HI> were in no condition to &s;end any A&s;&s;i&s;tance to tho&s;e, who might break out, &s;o that the Circum&s;tances of the Time were favourable; he de|&s;ired therefore, that they would go on, and not be alarmed at the fooli&s;h Behaviour of &s;ome, who, whatever might be given out in their Names, he believed, had more Wit than to ruin them&s;elves. Every Step that was made, and every Vote that was carried, was with the &s;ame Strength, and met with the &s;ame Oppo&s;ition: Both Parties giving &s;trict Attendance during the whole Se&s;&s;ion, which la&s;ted for three Months. Many Prote&s;tations were printed, with every Man's Vote: In conclu&s;ion, the whole Articles of the
<PB N="463" REF="489">
Treaty were agreed to, with &s;ome &s;mall Variations. The Earl of <NOTE PLACE="marg">1707. At la&s;t agreed to.</NOTE> <HI>Stair,</HI> having maintained the Debate on the la&s;t Day, in which, all was concluded, died the next Night &s;uddenly, his Spirits being quite exhau&s;ted by the Length and Vehemence of the De|bate. The Act pa&s;&s;ed, and was &s;ent up to <HI>London</HI> in the begin|ning of <HI>February.</HI></P>
<P>The Queen laid it before the two Hou&s;es; the Hou&s;e of Com|mons agreed to it all, without any Oppo&s;ition, &s;o &s;oon, that it was thought they interpo&s;ed not Delay and Con&s;ideration enough, &s;uitable to the Importance of &s;o great a Tran&s;action. The De|bates were longer and more &s;olemn in the Hou&s;e of Lords; the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> moved, that a Bill might be brought in, for &s;ecuring the Church of <HI>England;</HI> by it, all Acts, pa&s;&s;ed in favour of our Church, were declared to be in full force for ever; and this was made a fundamental and e&s;&s;ential Part of the Union. Some Exceptions were taken to the Words of the Bill, as not &s;o &s;trong as the Act pa&s;&s;ed in <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;eemed to be, &s;ince the Government of it was not declared to be unalterable: But they were judged more proper, &s;ince, where a &s;upreme Legi&s;lature is once acknow|ledged, nothing can be unalterable. After this was over, the Lords entered upon the Con&s;ideration of the Articles, as they were amended in <HI>Scotland;</HI> it was pretended, that here a new Con|&s;titution was made, the con&s;equence of which, they &s;aid, was the altering all the Laws of <HI>England.</HI> All the Judges were of opinion, that there was no weight in this; great Exceptions were taken to the &s;mall Proportion, <HI>Scotland</HI> was rated at, in the lay|ing on of Taxes; and their Election of Peers, to every new Par|liament, was &s;aid to be contrary to the Nature of Peerage. To all the Objections that were offered, this general An&s;wer was made, that &s;o great a thing, as the Uniting the whole I&s;land into one Government, could not be compa&s;&s;ed, but with &s;ome In|conveniences: But if the Advantage of Safety and Union, was greater than tho&s;e Inconveniences, then a le&s;&s;er Evil mu&s;t be &s;ub|mitted to. An Elective Peer was indeed a great prejudice to the Peers of <HI>Scotland,</HI> but &s;ince they had &s;ubmitted to it, there was no ju&s;t occa&s;ion given to the Peers of <HI>England</HI> to complain of it. But the Debate held longe&s;t upon the Matters, relating to the Government of the Church; it was &s;aid, here was a real Danger the Church ran into, when &s;o many Votes, of Per&s;ons tied to <HI>Presbytery,</HI> were admitted to a &s;hare in the Legi&s;lature. All the Rigour, with which the Epi&s;copal Clergy had been treated in <HI>Scotland,</HI> was &s;et forth, to &s;hew with how implacable a Temper they were &s;et again&s;t the Church of <HI>England;</HI> yet, in return to all that, it was now demanded, from the Men of this Church,
<PB N="464" REF="490">
to enact, that the <HI>Scotch</HI> Form &s;hould continue unalterable, and to admit tho&s;e to vote among us, who were &s;uch declared Ene|mies to our Con&s;titution. Here was a plau&s;ible Subject for popu|lar Eloquence, and a great deal of it was brought out upon this occa&s;ion, by <HI>Hooper, Beveridge,</HI> and &s;ome other Bi&s;hops, and by the Earls of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Nottingham.</HI> But to all this it was an&s;wered, that the chief Dangers the Church was in, were from <HI>France</HI> and from Popery: &s;o that what&s;oever &s;ecured us from the&s;e, delivered us from our ju&s;te&s;t Fears. <HI>Scotland</HI> lay on the weake&s;t &s;ide of <HI>England,</HI> where it could not be defended, but by an Army: The Coaleries on the <HI>Tine</HI> lay expo&s;ed for &s;everal Miles, and could not be pre&s;erved, but at a great charge, and with a great force: If a War &s;hould fall out between the two Nations, and if <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hould be conquered, yet, even in that ca&s;e, it mu&s;t be united to <HI>England,</HI> or kept under by an Army: The Danger of keeping up a Standing Force, in the hands of any Prince, and to be modelled by him (who might engage the <HI>Scotch</HI> to join with that Army and turn upon <HI>England)</HI> was vi&s;ible: and any Union, after &s;uch a Conque&s;t, would look like a Force, and &s;o could not be la&s;ting; whereas all was now voluntary. As for Church|matters, there had been &s;uch Violence u&s;ed by all &s;ides in their turns, that none of them could reproach the others much, with|out having it returned upon them too ju&s;tly. A &s;ofter Manage|ment would lay tho&s;e Heats, and bring Men to a better Temper: The <HI>Cantons</HI> of <HI>Switzerland,</HI> tho' very zealous in their different Religions, yet were united in one general Body: The Diet of <HI>Germany</HI> was compo&s;ed of Men of three different Religions: &s;o that &s;everal Con&s;titutions of Churches might be put under one Legi&s;lature; and if there was a danger of either &s;ide, it was much more likely that 513 would be too hard for 45, than that 45 would ma&s;ter 513; e&s;pecially when the Crown was on their &s;ide: and there were twenty &s;ix Bi&s;hops in the Hou&s;e of Lords, to outweigh the &s;ixteen Votes from <HI>Scotland.</HI> It was indeed &s;aid, that all in <HI>England</HI> were not zealous for the Church; to which it was an&s;wered, that by the &s;ame rea&s;on it might be concluded, that all tho&s;e of <HI>Scotland</HI> were not zealous for their Way, e&s;pe|cially when the Favour of the Court lay in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Scale. The matter was argued, for the Union, by the Bi&s;hops of <HI>Oxford, Nor|wich</HI> and my &s;elf, by the Lord <HI>Trea&s;urer,</HI> the Earls of <HI>Sunder|land</HI> and <HI>Wharton,</HI> and the Lords <HI>Town&s;hend</HI> and <HI>Halifax;</HI> but above all, by the Lord <HI>Somers.</HI> Every Divi&s;ion of the Hou&s;e was made, with &s;o great an inequality, that they were but 20, again&s;t 50 that were for the Union. When all was agreed to, in both Hou&s;es, a Bill was ordered to be brought in to enact it; which
<PB N="465" REF="491">
was prepared by <HI>Harcourt,</HI> with &s;o particular a Contrivance, that it cut off all Debates. The Preamble was a Recital of the Ar|ticles, as they were pa&s;&s;ed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> together with the Acts made in both Parliaments, for the Security of their &s;everal Chur|ches; and in conclu&s;ion, there came one Enacting Clau&s;e, ratify|ing all. This put tho&s;e, upon great Difficulties, who had re&s;ol|ved to object to &s;everal Articles, and to in&s;i&s;t on demanding &s;ome Alterations in them; for they could not come at any De|bate about them; they could not object to the Recital, it being merely Matter of fact; and they had not Strength enough, to op|po&s;e the general Enacting Clau&s;e, nor was it ea&s;y to come at particulars, and to offer Provi&s;o's relating to them. The Matter was carried on with &s;uch Zeal, that it pa&s;&s;ed through the Hou&s;e of Commons, before tho&s;e, who intended to oppo&s;e it, had reco|vered them&s;elves out of the Surprize, under which the Form, it was drawn in, had put them. It did not &s;tick long in the Hou&s;e of Lords, for all the Articles had been copiou&s;ly debated there for &s;everal Days, before the Bill was &s;ent up to them: And thus this great De&s;ign, &s;o long wi&s;hed and laboured for in vain, was begun, and happily ended, within the Compa&s;s of Nine Months. The Union was to commence on the Fir&s;t of <HI>May,</HI> and 'till that time, the two Kingdoms were &s;till di&s;tinct, and their two Par|liaments continued &s;till to &s;it.</P>
<P>In <HI>Scotland,</HI> they proceeded to di&s;po&s;e of the Sum, provided <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Equiva|lent di&s;po&s;ed of.</NOTE> to be the Equivalent: In this, great Partialities appeared, which were much complained of; but there was not Strength to op|po&s;e them. The Mini&s;try, and tho&s;e who depended on them, moved for very extravagant Allowances to tho&s;e, who had been employed in this la&s;t, and in the former Treaty; and they made large Allotments, of &s;ome Publick Debts, that were complained of as unrea&s;onable and unju&s;t; by which, a great part of the Sum was diverted, from an&s;wering the End, for which it was given. This was much oppo&s;ed by the <HI>Squadrone;</HI> but as the Mini&s;ters promoted it, and tho&s;e, who were to get by it, made all the In|tere&s;t they could to obtain it (&s;ome few of them only excepted, who, as became generous Patriots, &s;hewed more regard to the Publick, than to their private Ends) &s;o tho&s;e, who had op|po&s;ed the Union, were not ill plea&s;ed to &s;ee this Sum &s;o mi&s;ap|plied; hoping by that means, that the Aver&s;ion, which they en|deavoured to infu&s;e into the Nation again&s;t the Union, would be much encrea&s;ed; therefore they let every thing go as the Mini&s;ters pro|po&s;ed, to the great grief of tho&s;e, who wi&s;hed well to the Pub|lick. It was re&s;olved, that the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> &s;hould &s;it out its Period, which, by the Law for Triennial Parliaments,
<PB N="466" REF="492">
ran yet a Year further; it was thought nece&s;&s;ary, to have another Se&s;&s;ion continued of the &s;ame Men, who had made this Union, &s;ince they would more readily con&s;olidate and &s;trengthen their own Work. Upon this ground, it &s;eemed mo&s;t proper, that the Members, to repre&s;ent <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;hould be na|med by the Parliament there: Tho&s;e, who had oppo&s;ed the U|nion, carried their Aver&s;ion to the <HI>Squadrone</HI> &s;o far, that they concurred with the Mini&s;try in a Nomination, in which very few of them were included, not above three of the Peers, and fif|teen Commoners; &s;o that great and ju&s;t Exceptions lay again&s;t ma|ny, who were nominated to repre&s;ent that Kingdom: all this was very acceptable to tho&s;e, who had oppo&s;ed the Union. The Cu&s;|toms of <HI>Scotland</HI> were then in a Farm, and the Farmers were the Creatures of the Mini&s;try, &s;ome of whom, as was believed, were Sharers with them: It was vi&s;ible, that &s;ince there was to be a free Trade opened, between <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> after the Fir&s;t of <HI>May,</HI> and &s;ince the Duties in <HI>Scotland,</HI> laid on Trade, were much lower than in <HI>England,</HI> that there would be a great Importation into <HI>Scotland,</HI> on the Pro&s;pect of the Advantage, that might be made by &s;ending it into <HI>England.</HI> Upon &s;uch an Emergency, it was rea&s;onable to break the Farm, as had been ordinarily done upon le&s;s rea&s;on, and to take the Cu&s;toms into a new Management, that &s;o the Gain, to be made in the Inter|val, might go to the Publick, and not be left in private Hands: but the Lea&s;e was continued in favour of the Farmers. They were Men of no Intere&s;t of their own, &s;o it was not doubted, but that there was a &s;ecret practice in the Ca&s;e. Upon the view of the Gain, to be made by &s;uch an Importation, it was under|&s;tood, that Orders were &s;ent to <HI>Holland,</HI> and other places, to buy up Wine, Brandy, and other Merchandize. And another notorious Fraud was de&s;igned by &s;ome in <HI>England;</HI> who, be|cau&s;e of the great Draw-back, that was allowed for Tobacco and other Plantation Commodities, when exported, were &s;ending great Quantities to <HI>Scotland,</HI> on de&s;ign to bring them back after the Fir&s;t of <HI>May,</HI> that &s;o they might &s;ell them free of that Duty: So a Bill was offered to the Hou&s;e of Commons, for preventing this. While this was going on, <HI>Harley</HI> propo&s;ed the joining ano|ther Clau&s;e, to this effect; That all Goods, that were carried to <HI>Scotland,</HI> after the Fir&s;t of <HI>February</HI> (unle&s;s it were by the natu|ral-born Subjects of that Kingdom, inhabiting in it) in ca&s;e they were imported into <HI>England</HI> after the Fir&s;t of <HI>May,</HI> &s;hould be liable to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Duties; and of this the Proof was to lie on the Importer. This angred all the <HI>Scotch,</HI> who rai&s;ed a high Clamour upon it, and &s;aid the Union was broke by it; and that
<PB N="467" REF="493">
&s;uch a Proceeding would have very ill Effects in <HI>Scotland.</HI> But the Hou&s;e of Commons were &s;o alarmed, with the News of a va&s;t Importation, which was aggravated far beyond the truth, and by which they concluded the Trade of <HI>England</HI> would great|ly &s;uffer, at lea&s;t for a Year or two, that they pa&s;&s;ed the Bill, and &s;ent it to the Lords, where it was rejected; for it appeared plainly to them, that this was an Infraction of &s;ome of the Ar|ticles of the Treaty. It was &s;ugge&s;ted, that a Rece&s;s for &s;ome days was nece&s;&s;ary, that &s;o the Commons might have an oppor|tunity to prepare a Bill, prohibiting all Goods from being brought to <HI>England,</HI> that had been &s;ent out, only in order that the Mer|chants might have the Draw-back allowed. With this view, the Parliament was prorogued for a few days; but at their next meeting, the Commons were more inflamed than before: So they prepared a new Bill, to the &s;ame effect, only in &s;ome Clau|&s;es it was more &s;evere than the former had been: But the Lords did not agree to it, and &s;o it fell.</P>
<P>Thus far I have carried on the Recital of this great Tran&s;ac|tion, rather in &s;uch a general view, as may tran&s;mit it right to Po&s;terity, than in &s;o copious a Narration, as an Affair of &s;uch con&s;equence might &s;eem to de&s;erve: It is very probable, that a particular Journal, of the Debates in the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which were long and fierce, may at &s;ome time or other be made publick: But I hope this may &s;uffice for a Hi&s;tory. I cannot, upon &s;uch a &s;ignal Occa&s;ion, re&s;train my&s;elf from making &s;ome <NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections on the U|nion.</NOTE> Reflections, on the Directions of Providence in this matter. It it certain the De&s;ign on <HI>Darien,</HI> the great Charge it put the Na|tion to, and the total Mi&s;carriage of that Project, made the tra|ding Part of that Kingdom &s;ee the Impo&s;&s;ibility of undertaking any great De&s;ign in Trade; and that made them the more rea|dily concur, in carrying on the Union, The wi&s;er Men of that Nation had ob&s;erved long, that <HI>Scotland</HI> lay at the mercy of the Mini&s;try, and that every new Set of Mini&s;ters made u&s;e of their Power, to enrich them&s;elves and their Creatures, at the Co&s;t of the Publick; that the Judges, being made by them, were in &s;uch a Dependance, that &s;ince there are no Juries allowed in <HI>Scotland</HI> in Civil Matters, the whole Property of the Kingdom was in their hands, and by their means in the hands of the Mi|ni&s;ters: They had al&s;o ob&s;erved, how ineffectual it had been to complain of them at Court: It put tho&s;e, who ventured on it, to a va&s;t Charge, to no other purpo&s;e, but to expo&s;e them the more to the Fury of the Mini&s;try. The poor Noblemen, and the poor Burroughs made a great Majority in their Parliament, and were ea&s;ily to be purcha&s;ed by the Court: So they &s;aw no
<PB N="468" REF="494">
hopes of a Remedy to &s;uch a Mi&s;chief, but by an incorpora|ting Union with <HI>England.</HI> The&s;e Thoughts were much quick|ned, by the Pro&s;pect of recovering, what they had lo&s;t in that ill|concerted Undertaking of <HI>Darien;</HI> and this was &s;o univer&s;al and &s;o operative, that the De&s;ign on <HI>Darien,</HI> which the <HI>Jacobites</HI> had &s;et on foot and pro&s;ecuted with &s;o much fury, and with bad Intentions, did now engage many to promote the Union, who, without that Con&s;ideration, would have been at lea&s;t neu|tral, if not backward in it. The Court was engaged to promote the Union, on account of the Act of Security, pa&s;t in the Year 1704, which was imputed chiefly to the Lord Trea&s;urer: Threat|nings, of Impeaching him for advi&s;ing it, had been often let fall, and upon that, his Enemies had &s;et their chief hopes of pulling him down: for though no proof could be brought of his Coun|&s;el in it, yet it was not doubted, but that his Advice had deter|mined the Queen to pa&s;s it. An Impeachment was a word of an odious &s;ound, which would engage a Party again&s;t him, and di&s;order a Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament; and the lea&s;t ill effect it might have, would be to oblige him to withdraw from Bu&s;ine&s;s, which was chiefly aimed at. The Queen was very &s;en&s;ible, that his ma|naging the great Tru&s;t he was in, in the manner he did, made all the re&s;t of her Government both &s;afe and ea&s;y to her; &s;o &s;he &s;pared no pains to bring this about, and it was believed &s;he was at no &s;mall Co&s;t to compa&s;s it, for tho&s;e of <HI>Scotland</HI> had learned from <HI>England,</HI> to &s;et a Price on their Votes, and they expected to be well paid for them: The Lord Trea&s;urer did al&s;o be&s;tir him&s;elf in this matter, with an Activity and Zeal, that &s;eemed not to be in his nature: and indeed, all the application, with which the Court &s;et on this Affair, was nece&s;&s;ary to ma&s;ter the Oppo&s;ition and Difficulties, that &s;prang up in the progre&s;s of it. That which compleated all was, the low State to which the Affairs of <HI>France</HI> were reduced: They could neither &s;pare Men, nor Mo|ney, to &s;upport their Party, which otherwi&s;e they would un|doubtedly have done: They had, in imitation of the Exchequer-Notes here in <HI>England,</HI> given out <HI>Mint-Bills,</HI> to a great Value; &s;ome &s;aid two hundred Millions of Livres: The&s;e were ordered to be taken, by the Subjects in all Payments, as Money to the full Value, but were not to be received in payments of the King's Taxes: This put them under a great Di&s;credit, and the Fund created, for repaying them, not being thought a good one, they had &s;unk 70 <HI>per Cent.</HI> This created an unexpre&s;&s;ible Di&s;order in all Payments, and in the whole Commerce of <HI>France:</HI> All the Methods, that were propo&s;ed for rai&s;ing their Credit, had proved ineffectual; for they remained after all, at the Di&s;count
<PB N="469" REF="495">
of 58 <HI>per Cent.</HI> A Court, in this di&s;tre&s;s, was not in a condi|tion to &s;pare much, to &s;upport &s;uch an incon&s;iderable Intere&s;t, as they e&s;teemed their Party in <HI>Scotland:</HI> &s;o they had not the a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which they promi&s;ed them&s;elves from thence. The conjuncture, of all the&s;e things meeting together, which brought this great Work to a happy conclu&s;ion, was &s;o remarkable, that I hope my laying it all in one view, will be thought no imperti|nent Digre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>This was the chief Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament: and it was brought about, here in <HI>England,</HI> both &s;ooner, and with le&s;s Difficulty, than was expected. The Grant of the Supplies went on quicker, than was u&s;ual. There was only one Parti|cular, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sup|plies were granted.</NOTE> to which great Objections were made: Upon the great and early Succe&s;s of the former Campaign, it was thought nece&s;|&s;ary to follow that, with other Projects, that drew on a great Expence, beyond what had been e&s;timated, and laid before the Parliament. An Imbarkation, fir&s;t de&s;igned again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> and afterwards &s;ent to <HI>Portugal;</HI> and the extraordinary Supplies, that the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI>'s Affairs called for, amounted to about 800,000 <HI>l.</HI> more, than had been provided for by Parliament. Some complained of this, and &s;aid, that if a Mini&s;try could thus run the Nation into a great Charge, and expect that the Parliament mu&s;t pay the Reckoning, this might have very ill Con&s;equences. But to this it was an&s;wered, that a Mini&s;try de&s;erved publick Thanks, that had followed our Advantages, with &s;uch Vigour: If any thing was rai&s;ed without nece&s;&s;ity, or ill applied, under the pretence of &s;erving the Publick, it was very rea&s;onable to enquire into it, and to let it fall heavy on tho&s;e, who were in fault: But if no other Exception lay to it, than becau&s;e the mat|ter could not be fore&s;een, nor communicated to the Parliament, before tho&s;e Accidents happened, that occa&s;ioned the Expence, it was a very unju&s;t Di&s;couragement, if Mini&s;ters were to be quarrelled with, for their Care and Zeal: So it was carried by a great Majority, to di&s;charge this Debt. All the other Supplies, and among them the Equivalent for <HI>Scotland,</HI> were given, and lodged on good Funds: So that no Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament had ever rai&s;ed &s;o much, and &s;ecured it &s;o well, as this had done. The Se&s;&s;ion came to a happy conclu&s;ion, and the Parliament to an end. But the Queen, by virtue of a Clau&s;e in the Act of Union, revived it by Proclamation. Upon this, many of the <HI>Scotch</HI> Lords came up, and were very well received; two of them, <HI>Montro&s;e</HI> and <HI>Roxburgh,</HI> were made Dukes in <HI>Scotland;</HI> &s;ome of them were made Privy Coun&s;ellours in <HI>England;</HI> and a Commi&s;&s;ion, for a new Council, was &s;ent to <HI>Scotland:</HI> There ap|peared
<PB N="470" REF="496">
&s;oon two different Parties, among the <HI>Scotch;</HI> &s;ome of them moved, that there &s;hould neither be a di&s;tinct Government, nor a Privy Council continued there, but that all &s;hould be brought under one Admini&s;tration, as the &s;everal Counties in <HI>England</HI> were; They &s;aid, the &s;ooner all were con&s;olidated, in all re&s;pects, into one Body, the Po&s;&s;ibility of &s;eparating and di&s;uniting them, would be the &s;ooner extingui&s;hed; this was pre&s;&s;ed with the mo&s;t Earne&s;tne&s;s by tho&s;e, who were weary of the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try, and longed to &s;ee their Power at an end: But the Mini&s;try, who had a mind to keep up their Authority, &s;aid, there was a nece&s;|&s;ity of pre&s;erving a &s;hew of Greatne&s;s, and a form of Govern|ment in tho&s;e Parts, both for &s;ubduing the <HI>Jacobites,</HI> and that the Nation might not be di&s;gu&s;ted, by too &s;udden an Alteration of outward Appearances. The Court re&s;olved to maintain the Mi|ni&s;try there, till the next Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, in which new Mea|&s;ures might be taken. Thus our Affairs were happily &s;ettled at home, and the Fir&s;t of <HI>May</HI> was celebrated, with a decent So|lemnity, for then the Union took place.</P>
<P>The Convocation &s;at this Winter; and the &s;ame Temper, that <NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceedings in Convo|cation.</NOTE> had for &s;ome Years po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Lower Hou&s;e, did &s;till prevail a|mong them: When the Debates concerning the Union were before the Parliament, &s;ome in the Lower Hou&s;e &s;poke very tragically on that Subject: a Committee was named to con&s;ider of the pre&s;ent Danger of the Church, though but a little while before, they had concurred with the Bi&s;hops, in a very re&s;pectful Addre&s;s to the Queen, in which it was acknowledged, that the Church was, under her Maje&s;ty's Admini&s;tration, in a &s;afe and flouri&s;hing Con|dition: This was carried, by the private Management of &s;ome a&s;|piring Men among&s;t them, who hoped by a piece of skill to &s;hew what they could do, that it might recommend them to farther Preferment; they were much cried out on, as Betrayers of their Party, for carrying that Addre&s;s; &s;o to recover their Credit, and becau&s;e their hopes from the Court were not &s;o promi&s;ing, they re&s;olved now to act another part. It was given out, that they in|tended to make an Application to the Hou&s;e of Commons, a|gain&s;t the Union; to prevent that, the Queen wrote to the Arch|bi&s;hop, ordering him to prorogue them for three Weeks: by this means that De&s;ign was defeated, for before the end of the three Weeks, the Union had pa&s;&s;ed both Hou&s;es. But, when one fac|tious De&s;ign failed, they found out another; they ordered a Re|pre&s;entation, to be made to the Bi&s;hops, which &s;et forth, that ever &s;ince the Submi&s;&s;ion of the Clergy in <HI>Henry</HI> the VIII's time, which was for a cour&s;e of 173 Years, no &s;uch Prorogation had ever been ordered, during the &s;itting of Parliament: and
<PB N="471" REF="497">
they be&s;ought the Bi&s;hops, that from the con&s;oientious Regard, which they doubted not they had, for the welfare of this Church, they would u&s;e their utmo&s;t endeavours, that they might &s;till enjoy tho&s;e U&s;ages, of which they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and which they had never mi&s;employed: With this, they brought up a Sche|dule, containing, as they &s;aid, all the Dates of the Prorogations, both of Parliament and Convocation, thereby to make good their A&s;&s;ertion: And to cover this &s;eeming Complaint of the Queen's Proceedings, they pa&s;&s;ed a Vote, that they did not in|tend to enter into any Debate, concerning the Validity of the late Prorogation, to which they had humbly &s;ubmitted. It was found to be a &s;trange and a bold A&s;&s;ertion, that this Prorogation was without a Precedent: Their Charge, in the pre&s;erving their U|&s;ages, on the Con&s;ciences of the Bi&s;hops, in&s;inuated that this was a Breach made on them: The Bi&s;hops &s;aw this was plainly an At|tempt on the Queen's Supremacy; &s;o they ordered it to be laid before her Maje&s;ty: and they ordered al&s;o a Search to be made into the Records. For though it was an undoubted Maxim, that nothing but a po&s;itive Law could limit the Prerogative, which a Non-u&s;age could not do; yet they ordered the Schedule, offer|ed by the Lower Hou&s;e, to be compared with the Records: they found that &s;even or eight Prorogations had been ordered, during the &s;itting of Parliament, and there were about thirty or forty more, by which it appeared, that the Convocation &s;at &s;ometimes before, and &s;ometimes after a Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, and &s;at &s;ometimes, even when the Parliament was di&s;&s;olved. Upon all this, the Queen wrote another more &s;evere Letter to the Archbi|&s;hop, complaining of the Clergy, for not only continuing their illegal Practices, but reflecting on her late Order, as without a Precedent, and contrary to ancient U&s;ages; which as it was un|true in fact, &s;o it was an Inva&s;ion of her Supremacy: She had &s;hewed much Tenderne&s;s to the Clergy, but if any thing of this nature &s;hould be attempted for the future, &s;he would u&s;e means warranted by Law, for puni&s;hing Offenders, how unwil|ling &s;oever &s;he might be to proceed to &s;uch mea&s;ures. When the day came, on which this was to be communicated to the Low|er Hou&s;e, the <HI>Prolocutor</HI> had gone out of Town, without &s;o much as asking the Archbi&s;hop's leave, &s;o a very &s;mall num|ber of the Clergy appeared: Upon this &s;ignal Contempt, the Archbi&s;hop pronounced him contumacious, and referred the fur|ther cen&s;uring him to the day, he &s;et for their next meeting: The Prolocutor's Party pre&s;&s;ed him to &s;tand it out, and to make no Submi&s;&s;ion; but he had &s;ounder Advice given him, by &s;ome who under&s;tood the Law better; &s;o he made a full Submi&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="472" REF="498">
with which the Archbi&s;hop was &s;atisfied: Yet a Party continued, with great Impudence to a&s;&s;ert, that their Schedule was true, and that the Queen was mi&s;informed, though the Lord Chancellor, made now a Peer of <HI>England,</HI> and the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Holt,</HI> had, upon peru&s;al of the Records, affirmed to the Queen, that their A&s;&s;ertion was fal&s;e, and that there were many Precedents, for &s;uch Prorogations.</P>
<P>And now I mu&s;t look abroad into foreign Affairs. The <HI>French</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in <HI>Italy.</HI></NOTE> were lo&s;ing place after place in <HI>Lombardy: Cremona, Mantua,</HI> and the Citadel of <HI>Milan,</HI> were the only places, that were left in their hands: It was not po&s;&s;ible to maintain the&s;e long, with|out a greater force, nor was it ea&s;y to convey that to them. On the other hand, the reducing tho&s;e Fortre&s;&s;es was like to be a work of time, which would fatigue the Troops, and would bring a great Charge with it; &s;o a Capitulation was propo&s;ed, for delivering up tho&s;e places, and for allowing the <HI>French</HI> Troops a free March to <HI>Dauphiny.</HI> As &s;oon as this was &s;ent to <HI>Vienna,</HI> it was agreed to, without communicating it to the Al|lies, which gave ju&s;t cau&s;e of offence: It was &s;aid in excu&s;e, that every General had a power to agree to a Capitulation; &s;o the Emperor, in this ca&s;e, was not bound to &s;tay, for the Con&s;ent of the Allies. This was true, if the Capitulation had been for one &s;ingle place, but this was of the nature of a Treaty, being of a greater extent: By this, the <HI>French</HI> &s;aved ten or 12000 Men, who mu&s;t all have been, in a little time, made Pri&s;oners of War: They were veterane Troops, and were &s;ent into <HI>Spain,</HI> of which we quickly felt the ill Effects.</P>
<P>The De&s;ign was formed, for the following Campaign, after this manner: The Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> undertook to march an Army into <HI>France,</HI> and to act there, as &s;hould be concerted by the Allies: Some propo&s;ed the marching through <HI>Dauphiny,</HI> to the River of the <HI>Rhone,</HI> and &s;o up to <HI>Lyons:</HI> But an Attempt upon <HI>Toulon</HI> was thought the mo&s;t important thing, that could be de&s;igned; &s;o that was &s;ettled on. Mare&s;chal <HI>Te&s;&s;e</HI> was &s;ent to &s;ecure the Pa&s;&s;es, and to cover <HI>France</HI> on that &s;ide. This Winter the Prince of <HI>Baden</HI> died, little e&s;teemed, and little lamented; the Mar|qui&s;s of <HI>Bareith</HI> had the Command of the Army, on the Up|per <HI>Rhine,</HI> from whom le&s;s was expected; he was &s;o ill &s;upport|ed, that he could do nothing. The Court of <HI>Vienna</HI> was &s;o &s;et on the Reduction of <HI>Hungary,</HI> that they thought of nothing el&s;e: The <HI>Hungarians</HI> were very numerous, but they wanted both Officers and Di&s;cipline: <HI>Ragotzi</HI> had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of almo&s;t all <HI>Tran&s;ilvania,</HI> and the <HI>Hungarians</HI> were &s;o alienated from the Emperor, that they were con&s;ulting about chu&s;ing a new King.</P>
<P><PB N="473" REF="499">
The Eyes of all <HI>Europe</HI> were upon the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> who having po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of <HI>Saxony,</HI> made King <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> &s;oon feel, that now, that his Hereditary Dominions were in his Ene|my's <NOTE PLACE="marg">And in <HI>Po|land.</HI></NOTE> hands, he could no longer maintain the War in <HI>Poland:</HI> So a Treaty was &s;et on foot, with &s;uch &s;ecrecy, that it was con|cluded, before it was apprehended to be in agitation. King <HI>Au|gu&s;tus</HI> was only waiting for a fit Opportunity, to di&s;engage him|&s;elf from his <HI>Polanders,</HI> and from the <HI>Mu&s;covites;</HI> an Incident happened that had almo&s;t imbroiled all again: The <HI>Polanders</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> attacked a Body of <HI>Swedes,</HI> at a great di&s;advan|tage, being much &s;uperior to them in number: So the <HI>Swedes</HI> were almo&s;t cut to pieces. King <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> had no &s;hare in this, and did all that he dur&s;t venture on, to avoid it: He paid dear for it, hard Conditions were put on him, to which the nece&s;&s;ity of his affairs forced him to &s;ubmit. He made all the ha&s;te, he &s;afely could, to get out of <HI>Poland:</HI> he re&s;igned back their Crown to them, and was contented with the empty name of King, though that &s;eemed rather to be a reproach, than any acce&s;&s;ion of Honour to his Electoral Dignity; He thought other|wi&s;e, and &s;tipulated that it &s;hould be continued to him: He was at mercy, for he had neither Forces nor Trea&s;ure. It was thought the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> treated him with too much rigour, when he had &s;o entirely ma&s;tered him: The other was as little pitied, as he de&s;erved to be, for by many wrong Practices, he had drawn all his Misfortunes on him&s;elf. The King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> being in the heart of <HI>Germany,</HI> in &s;o formidable a Po&s;ture, gave great Apprehen&s;ions to the Allies. The <HI>French</HI> made &s;trong applica|tions to him, but the Courts of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Hanover</HI> were in &s;uch a concert with that King, that they gave the re&s;t of the Al|lies great a&s;&s;urances, that he would do nothing, to di&s;turb the Peace of the Empire, nor to weaken the Alliance: The Court of <HI>France</HI> pre&s;&s;ed him to offer his Mediation for a general Peace; all the an&s;wer he gave was, that if the Allies made the like Ap|plication to him, he would interpo&s;e, and do all good Offices in a Treaty. So he refu&s;ed to enter into any &s;eparate mea&s;ures with <HI>France,</HI> yet the Court of <HI>Vienna</HI> was under a great apprehen&s;ion, of his &s;eeking matter for a Quarrel with them. The <HI>Czar</HI> at this time over-run <HI>Poland,</HI> &s;o that King <HI>Stani&s;laus</HI> was forced to fly into <HI>Saxony,</HI> to the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> for Protection: both he and his Queen &s;tayed there all the Winter, and a great part of this Summer. The <HI>Czar</HI> pre&s;&s;ed the <HI>Polanders</HI> to proceed to the Election of another King, but could not carry them to that; &s;o it was generally believed, that they were re&s;olved to come to a Treaty with King <HI>Stani&s;laus,</HI> and to &s;ettle the Quiet of that King|dom,
<PB N="474" REF="500">
exhau&s;ted by a long and de&s;tructive War. The <HI>Czar</HI> tried, if it were po&s;&s;ible to come to a Peace with the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and made great Offers in order to it; but that King was implacable, and &s;eemed re&s;olved to pull him down, as he had done King <HI>Augu&s;tus.</HI> That King's De&s;igns were impenetrable, he advi&s;ed <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cha|racter of the King of <HI>Sweden.</HI></NOTE> with few, and kept him&s;elf on great re&s;erves with all foreign Mi|ni&s;ters, whom he would not &s;uffer to come near him, except when they had a particular Me&s;&s;age to deliver. Our Court was advi&s;ed, by the Elector of <HI>Hanover,</HI> to &s;end the Duke of <HI>Marl|borough</HI> to Him: It was thought this would plea&s;e him much, if it had no other effect; &s;o he went thither, but could gain no ground on him. He affected a neglect of his Per&s;on, both in Cloaths, Lodging, and Diet; all was &s;imple, even to meanne&s;s, nay, he did not &s;o much as allow a decent Cleanline&s;s: He ap|peared to have a real Sen&s;e of Religion, and a Zeal for it, but it was not much enlightned: He &s;eemed to have no notion of Pub|lick-Liberty, but thought Princes ought to keep their Promi&s;es religiou&s;ly, and to ob&s;erve their Treaties punctually: He render|ed him&s;elf very acceptable to his Army, by coming &s;o near their way of living, and by his readine&s;s to expo&s;e his own Per&s;on, and to reward Services done him: He had little Tenderne&s;s in his nature, and was a fierce Enemy, too rough, and too &s;avage: He looked on Foreign Mini&s;ters, as Spies by their Character, and treated them accordingly; and he u&s;ed his own Mini&s;ters, rather as In&s;truments to execute his Orders, than as Coun&s;ellors.</P>
<P>The Court of <HI>France</HI> finding they could not prevail on him, made a publick Application to the Pope, for his mediating a <NOTE PLACE="marg">Propo&s;itions for a Peace.</NOTE> Peace: They offered the Dominions in <HI>Italy</HI> to King <HI>Charles,</HI> to the States a Barrier in the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> and a Compen&s;ation to the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> for the wa&s;te made in his Country; provided, that on tho&s;e Conditions, King <HI>Philip</HI> &s;hould keep <HI>Spain,</HI> and the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI> It was thought, the Court of <HI>Vienna</HI> wi&s;hed this Project might be entertained, but the other Allies were &s;o di&s;gu&s;ted at it, that they made no &s;teps toward it: The Court of <HI>Vienna</HI> did what they could, to confound the De&s;igns of this Campaign; for they ordered a Detachment of 12,000 Men to march, from the Army in <HI>Lombardy,</HI> to the Kingdom of <HI>Naples.</HI> The Court of <HI>England,</HI> the <HI>States,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> &s;tu|died to divert this, with the warme&s;t in&s;tances po&s;&s;ible, but in vain: though it was repre&s;ented to that Court, that if the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> could enter into <HI>Provence,</HI> with a great Army, that would cut off all Supplies, and Communication with <HI>France:</HI> &s;o that Succe&s;s, in this great De&s;ign, would make <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Sicily</HI> fall into their hands of cour&s;e; but the Imperial Court was
<PB N="475" REF="501">
inflexible: They pretended, they had given their Party in <HI>Naples</HI> &s;uch A&s;&s;urances of an Inva&s;ion, that if they failed in it, they ex|po&s;ed them all to be de&s;troyed, and thereby they might provoke the whole Country, to become their mo&s;t inveterate Enemies. Thus they took up a Re&s;olution, without con&s;ulting their Allies, and then pretended that it was fixed, and could not be altered.</P>
<P>The Campaign was opened very fatally in <HI>Spain:</HI> King <HI>Charles</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Battel of <HI>Alman|za.</HI></NOTE> pretended, there was an Army coming into <HI>Catalonia</HI> from <HI>Rou&s;|&s;illon;</HI> and that it was nece&s;&s;ary for him, to march into that Country: The dividing a Force, when the whole together was not equal to the Enemy's, has often proved fatal: He ought to have made his Army as &s;trong as po&s;&s;ibly he could, and to have marched with it to <HI>Madrid;</HI> for the re&s;t of <HI>Spain</HI> would have fallen into his hands, upon the Succe&s;s of that Expedition. But he per&s;i&s;ted in his fir&s;t Re&s;olution, and marched away with a part of the Army, leaving about 16000 Men under the Earl of <HI>Gallway</HI>'s command. They had eaten up all their Stores in <HI>Valentia,</HI> and could &s;ub&s;i&s;t no longer there; &s;o they were forced to break into <HI>Ca&s;tile:</HI> The Duke of <HI>Berwick</HI> came again&s;t them with an Army, not much &s;uperiour to theirs: But the Court of <HI>France</HI> had &s;ent the Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI> into <HI>Spain,</HI> with &s;ome of the be&s;t Troops, that they had brought from <HI>Italy;</HI> and the&s;e joined the Duke of <HI>Berwick,</HI> a day before the two Armies engaged. Some De&s;erters came over, and brought the Earl of <HI>Gallway</HI> the news of the Con|junction; but they were not believed, and were looked on as Spies, &s;ent to frighten them. A Council of War had re&s;olved to venture on a Battel, which the State of their Affairs &s;eemed to make nece&s;&s;ary: They could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t where they were, nor be &s;ub&s;i&s;ted if they retired back into <HI>Valentia;</HI> &s;o on the 14th of <HI>April,</HI> the two Armies engaged in the Plain of <HI>Almanza.</HI> The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> beat the Enemy, and broke through twice; but the <HI>Portugueze</HI> gave way: upon that the Enemy, who were almo&s;t double in number, both Hor&s;e and Foot, flanked them, and a total Rout followed, in which about 10,000 were killed or taken pri&s;oners. The Earl of <HI>Gallway</HI> was twice wounded; once &s;o near the Eye, that for &s;ome time it put him out of a ca|pacity of giving Orders: but at la&s;t he, with &s;ome other Officers, made the be&s;t Retreat they could. Our Fleet came happily on that Coa&s;t, on the day that the Battel was fought; &s;o he was &s;up|plied from thence, and he put Gari&s;ons into <HI>Denia</HI> and <HI>Alicant,</HI> and retired to the <HI>Ebro,</HI> with about 3000 Hor&s;e and almo&s;t as many Foot. The Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI> pur&s;ued the Victory; <HI>Valen|tia</HI> &s;ubmitted, and &s;o did <HI>Saragoza;</HI> &s;o that the Principality of <HI>Catalonia</HI> was all, that remained in King <HI>Charles</HI>'s obedience. The
<PB N="476" REF="502">
King of <HI>Portugal</HI> died this Winter, but that made no great change in Affairs there: The young King agreed to every thing that was propo&s;ed to him by the Allys; yet the <HI>Portugueze</HI> were under a great Con&s;ternation, their be&s;t Troops being either cut off, or at that time in <HI>Catalonia.</HI></P>
<P>Mar&s;hal <HI>Villars</HI> was &s;ent to command in <HI>Al&s;ace:</HI> He under|&s;tood that the Lines of <HI>Stolhoven</HI> were ill kept, and weakly man|ned; &s;o he pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and without any lo&s;s and very lit|tle oppo&s;ition he broke through, and &s;eized on the Artillery, and on &s;uch Magazines as were laid in there. Upon this &s;hameful Di&s;grace, the <HI>Germans</HI> retired to <HI>Hailbron:</HI> The Circle of <HI>Sua|bia</HI> was now open, and put under Contribution; and <HI>Villars</HI> de|&s;igned to penetrate as far as to <HI>Bavaria.</HI> The blame of this Mi&s;carriage was laid chiefly on the Imperial Court, who neither &s;ent their Quota thither, nor took care to &s;ettle a proper General for the defence of the Empire. In <HI>Flanders</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Army, commanded by the Duke of <HI>Vendome,</HI> came and took po&s;t at <HI>Gem|blours,</HI> in a &s;afe Camp; the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> lay at <HI>Meldert</HI> in a more open one: Both Armies were about 100,000 &s;trong; but the <HI>French</HI> were rather &s;uperiour to that number.</P>
<P>In the Month of <HI>June,</HI> the De&s;ign upon <HI>Toulon</HI> began to ap|pear: The <HI>Queen</HI> and the <HI>States</HI> &s;ent a &s;trong Fleet thither, com|manded by Sir <HI>Cloude&s;ly Shovel;</HI> who, from mean beginnings, had ri&s;en up to the &s;upreme Command; and had given many Proofs of great Courage, Conduct and Zeal, in the whole cour&s;e of his Life. Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> had the command of the Imperial Army, that was to &s;econd the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> in this Underta|king, upon the Succe&s;s of which the final Conclu&s;ion of the War depended. The Army was not &s;o &s;trong, as it was intended it &s;hould have been: The Detachment of 12,000 Men was ordered to march to <HI>Naples;</HI> and no Applications could prevail at the Court of <HI>Vienna,</HI> to obtain a delay in that Expedition: There were al&s;o eight or ten thou&s;and Recruits, that were promi&s;ed to be &s;ent to reinforce Prince <HI>Eugene,</HI> which were &s;topt in <HI>Germa|ny;</HI> for the Emperor was under &s;uch Apprehen&s;ions of a Rupture with <HI>Sweden,</HI> that he pretended it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, for his own &s;afety, to keep a good Force at home. Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> had al&s;o Orders, not to expo&s;e his Troops too much; by this means they were the le&s;s &s;erviceable: Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e Di&s;|appointments, the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> after he had for &s;ome Weeks covered his true De&s;ign, by a Feint upon <HI>Dauphiny,</HI> by which he drew mo&s;t of the <HI>French</HI> Troops to that &s;ide; as &s;oon as he heard that the Confederate Fleet was come upon the Coa&s;t, he made a very quick March through Ways, that were thought im|practicable,
<PB N="477" REF="503">
on to the River <HI>Var,</HI> where the <HI>French</HI> had ca&s;t up &s;uch Works, that it was reckoned the&s;e mu&s;t have &s;topt his pa&s;|&s;ing the River: and they would have done it effectually, if &s;ome Ships had not been &s;ent in from the Fleet, into the mouth of the River, to attack the&s;e where there was no defence; becau&s;e no Attack from that &s;ide was apprehended. By this means they were forced to abandon their Works, and &s;o the Pa&s;&s;age over the River was free: Upon this, that Duke entred <HI>Provence,</HI> and made all the ha&s;te he could towards <HI>Toulon.</HI> The Artillery and Am|munition were on board the Fleet, and were to be landed near the Place, &s;o the March of the Army was as little encumbred as was po&s;&s;ible; yet it was impo&s;&s;ible to advance with much ha&s;te in an Enemy's Country, where the Provi&s;ions were either de&s;troyed or carried into fortified Places, which tho' they might have ea&s;ily been taken, yet no time was to be lo&s;t in executing the great De|&s;ign; &s;o this retarded the March for &s;ome days: Yet in conclu|&s;ion they came before the Place, and were quickly ma&s;ters of &s;ome of the Eminencies, that commanded it. At their fir&s;t coming, they might have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of another called <HI>St. Anne's Hill,</HI> if Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> had executed the Duke of <HI>Sa|voy</HI>'s Orders: He did it not, which rai&s;ed a high Di&s;content; but he excu&s;ed him&s;elf, by &s;hewing the Orders he had received, not to expo&s;e the Emperor's Troops. Some days were lo&s;t by the roughne&s;s of the Sea, which hindred the Ships from landing the Artillery and Ammunition. In the mean while, the Troops of <HI>France</HI> were ordered to march from all parts to <HI>Toulon:</HI> The Gar|ri&s;on within was very &s;trong; the Forces that were on their march to <HI>Spain,</HI> to pro&s;ecute the Victory of <HI>Almanza,</HI> were coun|termanded; and &s;o great a part of <HI>Villars</HI>'s Army was called away, that he could not make any further progre&s;s in <HI>Germany.</HI> So that a great Force was, from all hands, marching to rai&s;e this Siege; and it was declared, in the Court of <HI>France,</HI> that the Duke of <HI>Burgundy</HI> would go and lead on the Army. The Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> lo&s;t no time, but continued Cannonading the Place, while the Fleet came up to bombard it: They attack'd the two Forts, that commanded the Entrance into the Mole with &s;uch fury, that they made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of them; but one of them was afterwards blown up. Tho&s;e within the Town were not idle: They &s;unk &s;ome Ships, in the Entrance into the Mole, and fired furiou&s;ly at the Fleet, but did them little harm: They beat the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> out of one of his mo&s;t important Po&s;ts, which was long defended by a gallant Prince of <HI>Saxe-Gotha;</HI> who not being &s;upported in time, was cut to pieces. This Po&s;t was afterwards regained, and the Fleet continued for &s;ome days to bombard the
<PB N="478" REF="504">
Place. But in the end, the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> who&s;e Strength had never been above 30,000 Men, &s;eeing &s;o great a Force marching towards him, who might intercept his pa&s;&s;age, and &s;o de&s;troy his whole Army; and there being no hope of his carrying the Place, found it nece&s;&s;ary to march home in time: which he did with &s;o much order and precaution, that he got back into his own Coun|try, without any lo&s;s; and &s;oon after his return, he &s;ate down before <HI>Suza,</HI> and took it in a few weeks. Our Fleet did all the <NOTE PLACE="marg">It failed in the Execu|tion.</NOTE> execution they could on the Town: their Bombs &s;et &s;ome places on fire, which they believed were Magazines; for they conti|nued burning for many hours; in conclu&s;ion, they &s;ailed off: They left behind them a Fleet of &s;ix and twenty Ships in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> and the great Ships &s;ailed homewards. Thus this great De&s;ign, on which the eyes of all <HI>Europe</HI> were &s;et, failed in the execution, chiefly by the Emperor's means: <HI>England</HI> and the <HI>States,</HI> performed all that was expected of them, nor was the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> wanting on his part; though many &s;u&s;pected him, as backward, and at lea&s;t cold in the Undertaking. It was not yet perfectly under&s;tood what Damage the <HI>French</HI> &s;u&s;tained: Many of their Ships were rendered un&s;erviceable, and continue to be &s;o &s;till: Nor did they &s;et out any Fleet all the following Winter; though the Affairs of King <HI>Charles</HI> in <HI>Spain</HI> were then &s;o low, that if they could have cut off the Communication by Sea, between <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> they mu&s;t &s;oon have been Ma&s;|ters of all, that was left in his hands: &s;o that from their fitting out no Fleet at <HI>Toulon,</HI> it was concluded, that they could not do it. When the De&s;ign upon <HI>Toulon</HI> was broke, more Troops were &s;ent into <HI>Spain:</HI> The Earl of <HI>Gallway</HI> did, with incredible Diligence and Activity, endeavour to repair the lo&s;s at <HI>Almanza,</HI> as much as was po&s;&s;ible: The Supplies and Stores that he had from our Fleet, put him in a Capacity to make a &s;tand; he form|ed a new Army, and put the &s;trong Places in the be&s;t po&s;ture he could; <HI>Lerida</HI> was the mo&s;t expo&s;ed, and &s;o was the be&s;t looked to; <HI>Torto&s;a, Tarragona,</HI> and <HI>Gironne,</HI> were al&s;o well fortified, and good Garri&s;ons were put in them. The Attempt on <HI>Toulon,</HI> as it put a &s;top to all the Motions of the <HI>French,</HI> &s;o it gave him time to put the Principality of <HI>Catalonia</HI> in a good &s;tate of de|fence. The Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> being reinforced with Troops <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Siege o$ <HI>Lerida</HI></NOTE> from <HI>France,</HI> &s;at down before <HI>Lerida,</HI> in the end of <HI>September,</HI> with an Army of 30,000 Men: The Place was commanded by a Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e,</HI> who held out above forty Days: After &s;ome time, he was forced to abandon the Town, and to retire into the Ca&s;tle; the Army &s;uffered much in this long Siege. When the Be&s;ieged &s;aw how long they could hold out, they gave
<PB N="479" REF="505">
the Earl of <HI>Gallway</HI> notice, upon which he intended to have rai&s;ed the Siege; and if the King of <HI>Spain</HI> would have con&s;ented to his drawing, out of the other Garri&s;ons, &s;uch a Force as might have been &s;pared, he undertook to rai&s;e it, which was believed might have been ea&s;ily done: and if he had &s;ucceeded, it would have given a new turn to all the Affairs of <HI>Spain.</HI> But Count <HI>Noyelles,</HI> who was well practi&s;ed in the arts of Flattery, and knew how much King <HI>Charles</HI> was alienated from the Earl of <HI>Gallway,</HI> for the hone&s;t Freedom he had u&s;ed with him, in laying before him &s;ome Errors in his Conduct, &s;et him&s;elf to oppo&s;e this, ap|prehending that Succe&s;s in it, would have rai&s;ed the Earl of <HI>Gallway</HI>'s Reputation again, which had &s;uffered a great diminu|tion by the Action of <HI>Almanza:</HI> He &s;aid, this would expo&s;e the little Army they had left them, to too great a hazard; for if the De&s;ign mi&s;carried, it might occa&s;ion a Revolt of the whole Prin|cipality. Thus the Humours of Princes are often more regarded than their Intere&s;t; the De&s;ign of relieving <HI>Lerida</HI> was laid a&s;ide. The <HI>French</HI> Army was dimini&s;hed a fourth part, and the long Siege had &s;o fatigued them, that it was vi&s;ible, the rai&s;ing it would have been no difficult Performance, but the thoughts of that being given over, <HI>Lerida</HI> capitulated in the beginning of <HI>November:</HI> The <HI>Spaniards</HI> made &s;ome feeble Attempts, on the &s;ide of <HI>Portugal,</HI> with &s;ucce&s;s, for little Re&s;i&s;tance was made; the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> excu&s;ing them&s;elves by their feeblene&s;s, &s;ince their be&s;t Troops were in <HI>Catalonia.</HI></P>
<P>King <HI>Charles,</HI> finding his Affairs in &s;o ill a condition, wrote <NOTE PLACE="marg">Relief &s;ent to <HI>Spain</HI></NOTE> to the Emperor, and to the other Allies, to &s;end him Supplies, with all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te: <HI>Stanhope</HI> was &s;ent over, to pre&s;s the Queen and the <HI>States</HI> to di&s;patch the&s;e the &s;ooner. At the end of the Campaign in <HI>Italy,</HI> 7000 of the Imperial Troops were prepared to be &s;ent over to <HI>Barcelona:</HI> and the&s;e were carried in the Winter, by the Confederate Fleet, without any di&s;turbance given them, by the <HI>French.</HI> Recruits and Supplies of all &s;orts were &s;ent over from <HI>England,</HI> and from the States to <HI>Portugal.</HI> But while the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> was &s;truggling with great diffi|culties, two pieces of Pomp and Magnificence con&s;umed a great part of their Trea&s;ure: An Emba&s;&s;y was &s;ent from <HI>Lisbon,</HI> to demand the Emperor's Si&s;ter for that King, which was done with an unu&s;ual and extravagant Expence: A Wife was to be &s;ought for King <HI>Charles,</HI> among the Prote&s;tant Courts, for there was not a &s;uitable Match in the Popi&s;h Courts: He had &s;een the Prince&s;s of <HI>An&s;pach,</HI> and was much taken with her; &s;o that great applications were made, to per&s;uade her to change her Religion, but &s;he could not be prevailed on, to buy a Crown at &s;o dear a

rate: And &s;oon after, &s;he was married to the Prince Electoral of <HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> which gave a glorious Character of her to this Nation; and her pious Firmne&s;s is like to be rewarded, even in this Life, by a much better Crown, than that which &s;he rejected. The Prince&s;s of <HI>Wolfenbutle</HI> was not &s;o firm; &s;o &s;he was brought to <HI>Vienna,</HI> and &s;ome time after was married by proxy to K. <HI>Charles,</HI> and was &s;ent to <HI>Italy,</HI> in her way to <HI>Spain.</HI> The Solemnity, with which the&s;e Matters were managed, in all this Di&s;tre&s;s of their Affairs, con&s;umed a va&s;t deal of Trea&s;ure; for &s;uch was the Pride of tho&s;e Courts on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, that, rather than fail in a point of Splendor, they would let their mo&s;t important Affairs go to wreck. That Prince&s;s was landed at <HI>Barcelona:</HI> And the Queen of <HI>Portugal</HI> the &s;ame year came to <HI>Holland,</HI> to be carried to <HI>Lisbon,</HI> by a Squadron of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet.</P>
<P>But while Matters were in a doubtful State in <HI>Spain,</HI> the Expe|dition <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Con|que&s;t of <HI>Naples.</HI></NOTE> to <HI>Naples</HI> had all the Succe&s;s, that was expected: The De|tachment from <HI>Lombardy</HI> marched thro' the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical State, and &s;truck no &s;mall Terror into the Court of <HI>Rome,</HI> as they pa&s;s'd near it: It was apprehended, &s;ome Re&s;i&s;tance would have been made in <HI>Naples,</HI> by tho&s;e who governed there under King <HI>Philip:</HI> But the in-bred Hatred the <HI>Neapolitans</HI> bore the <HI>French,</HI> together with the Severities of their Government, had put that whole King|dom, into &s;uch a Di&s;po&s;ition to revolt, that the &s;mall Party, which adhered to King <HI>Philip,</HI> found it not advi&s;eable to offer any re|&s;i&s;tance, &s;o they had only time enough to convey their Trea&s;ure, and all their riche&s;t Goods to <HI>Cayeta,</HI> and to retire thither: They reckoned, they would either be relieved from <HI>France</HI> by Sea, or obtain a good Capitulation: or if that failed, they had &s;ome Ships and Galleys, in which, they might hope to e&s;cape. The <HI>Impe|rial$&s;ts</HI> took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Naples,</HI> where they were received with great Rejoicings; their ill Conduct quickly moderated that Joy, and very much di&s;po&s;ed the <HI>Neapolitans</HI> to a &s;econd Revolt: But upon Applications, made to the Courts of <HI>Vienna</HI> and <HI>Barcelona,</HI> the Exce&s;&s;es of the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts,</HI> who carried their ravenous di&s;po|&s;ition with them where&s;oever they went, were &s;omewhat corrected, &s;o that they became more tolerable. As &s;oon as a Government could be &s;ettled at <HI>Naples,</HI> they undertook the Siege of <HI>Cayeta,</HI> which went on at fir&s;t very &s;lowly: So that tho&s;e within &s;eemed to apprehend nothing &s;o much, as the want of Provi&s;ions, upon which, they &s;ent the few Ships they had to <HI>Sicily,</HI> to bring them Supplies, for all they might want; when the&s;e were &s;ent away, the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts,</HI> knowing what a rich Booty was lodged in the Place, pre&s;&s;ed it very hard, and, in conclu&s;ion, took it by &s;torm; and &s;o were Ma&s;ters of all the Wealth, that was in it: The Gar|ri&s;on
<PB N="481" REF="507">
retired into the Ca&s;tle, but they were &s;oon after forced to &s;urrender, and were all made Pri&s;oners of War. It was propo&s;ed to follow this Succe&s;s, with an Attempt upon <HI>Sicily:</HI> But it was not ea&s;y to &s;upply <HI>Naples</HI> with Bread; nor was our Fleet at liber|ty to a&s;&s;i&s;t them; for they were ordered to lie on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Spain,</HI> and to wait there for Orders: when the&s;e arrived, they required them to carry the Marque&s;s <HI>das Minas</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Gallway,</HI> with the Forces of <HI>Portugal,</HI> to <HI>Lisbon;</HI> which was happily performed: and the Earl of <HI>Gallway</HI> found the Character and Powers of an Amba&s;&s;ador, lying for him there. The Thoughts, of attempting <HI>Sicily,</HI> were therefore laid a&s;ide for this time; tho' the <HI>Sicilians</HI> were known to be in a very good di&s;po&s;ition to en|tertain it. A &s;mall Force was &s;ent, from <HI>Naples,</HI> to &s;eize on tho&s;e Places, which lay on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Tu&s;cany,</HI> and belonged to the Crown of <HI>Spain:</HI> Some of them were &s;oon taken, but <HI>Porto Longone</HI> and <HI>Port Hercole</HI> made a better Re&s;i&s;tance: This was the State of Affairs in <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> all this Year, and till the open|ing of the Campaign the next Year.</P>
<P><HI>Villars</HI> continued in <HI>Germany,</HI> laying <HI>Suabia</HI> under heavy Con|tributions; and very probably he would have penetrated into <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs on the <HI>Rhine.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Bavaria,</HI> if the Detachments, he was ordered to &s;end away, had not &s;o weakned his Army, that he dur&s;t not venture further, nor undertake any con&s;iderable Siege. While the Empire was thus expo&s;ed, all Mens Eyes turned towards the Elector of <HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> as the only Per&s;on, that could recover their Affairs out of tho&s;e Extremities, into which they were brought: The Emperor pre&s;&s;ed him to accept of the &s;upreme Command; this was &s;econded by all the Allies, but mo&s;t earne&s;tly by the Queen and the <HI>States:</HI> The Elector u&s;ed all the Precaution, that the imbarking in &s;uch a De|&s;ign required, and he had &s;uch A&s;&s;urances of A&s;&s;i&s;tance, from the Princes and Circles, as he thought might be depended upon; &s;o he undertook the Command: His fir&s;t care was to re&s;tore mili|tary Di&s;cipline, which had been very little con&s;idered or &s;ubmitted to, for &s;ome Years pa&s;t; and he e&s;tabli&s;hed this, with &s;uch impar|tial Severity, that the Face of Affairs there was &s;oon changed: But the Army was too weak, and the Sea&s;on was too far &s;pent, to enter on great De&s;igns. One con&s;iderable Action happened, which very much rai&s;ed the Reputation of his Conduct: <HI>Villars</HI> had &s;ent a Detachment of 3000 Hor&s;e and Dragoons, either to extend his Contribution, or to &s;eize on &s;ome important Po&s;t; again&s;t the&s;e, the Elector &s;ent out another Body, that fell upon the <HI>French,</HI> and gave them a total Defeat; in which 2000 of them were cut off: Soon after that, <HI>Villars</HI> retired back to <HI>Stras|bourg,</HI> and the Campaign in tho&s;e Parts ended.</P>
<P><PB N="482" REF="508">
I will take in here a Tran&s;action, that lay not far from the Scene of Action. There was, all this Summer, a Di&s;pute at <HI>Neufcha&s;tel,</HI> upon the Death of the old Dutche&s;s of <HI>Nemours,</HI> in <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> judged Prince of <HI>Neufcha&s;tel.</HI></NOTE> whom the Hou&s;e of <HI>Longueville</HI> ended: She enjoyed this Princi|pality, which, &s;ince it lay as a Frontier to <HI>Switzerland,</HI> was on this occa&s;ion much con&s;idered. There were many Pretenders of the <HI>French</HI> Nation, the chief was the Prince of <HI>Conti;</HI> all the&s;e came to <HI>Neufcha&s;tel,</HI> and made their application to the <HI>States</HI> of that Country, and laid their &s;everal Titles before them: The King of <HI>France</HI> &s;eemed to favour the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> mo&s;t: But yet he left it free to the <HI>States,</HI> to judge of their Preten&s;ions, provided they gave judgment, in favour of one of his Subjects; adding &s;e|vere Threatnings, in ca&s;e they &s;hould judge in behalf of any other Pretender. The King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> as Heir by his Mother to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Charlons,</HI> claimed it as his right, which the late King had, by a particular agreement, made over to him; &s;o he &s;ent a Mini&s;ter thither, to put in his claim: And the Queen, and the <HI>States,</HI> ordered their Mini&s;ters in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> to do their be&s;t Offices, both for advancing his Preten&s;ions, and to engage the Cantons to maintain them; the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> wrote al&s;o to the Cantons to the &s;ame effect. The Allies looked on this, as a Mat|ter of great con&s;equence; &s;ince it might end in a Rupture between the Prote&s;tant Cantons and <HI>France;</HI> for the Popi&s;h Cantons were now wholly theirs. After much pleading, and a long Di&s;pute, the <HI>States</HI> of the Principality gave judgment, in favour of the King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia;</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Pretenders prote&s;ted again&s;t this, and left <HI>Neufcha&s;tel,</HI> in a high Di&s;content: The <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador threatned that little State, with an Inva&s;ion, and all Commerce with them was forbid: The Canton of <HI>Bern</HI> e&s;pou&s;ed their Con|cern, with a Spirit and Zeal, that was not expected from them: They declared, they were in a Comburgher&s;hip with them; and upon that, they &s;ent a Body of 3000 Men, to defend them. The <HI>French</HI> continued to threaten, and <HI>Villars</HI> had Orders to march a great Part of his Army towards them; but when the Court of <HI>France</HI> &s;aw, that the Cantons of <HI>Bern</HI> and <HI>Zurick</HI> were not frightened with tho&s;e Marches, they let the whole Matter fall, very little to their honour: And &s;o the Intercour&s;e, between the <HI>French</HI> Do|minions and that State, was again opened, and the Peace of the Cantons was &s;ecured. The King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> engaged his ho|nour, that he would govern that State, with a particular Zeal, for advancing both Religion and Learning in it; and upon the&s;e A&s;&s;urances, he per&s;uaded the Bi&s;hops of <HI>England,</HI> and my&s;elf in particular, to u&s;e our be&s;t Endeavours to promote his Preten&s;ions; upon which we wrote, in the mo&s;t effectual manner we could,

to Monf. <HI>O&s;tervald,</HI> who was the mo&s;t eminent Eccle&s;ia&s;tick of that State, and one of the be&s;t and mo&s;t judicious Divines of the Age: He was bringing that Church, to a near agreement with our Forms of Wor&s;hip: The King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> was well &s;et, in all Matters relating to Religion; and had made a great &s;tep, in order to reconcile the <HI>Lutherans</HI> and the <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> in his Domi|nions, by requiring them, not to preach to the People on tho&s;e Points, in which they differ; and by obliging them, to commu|nicate together, notwith&s;tanding the Diver&s;ity of their Opinions: Which is indeed the only wi&s;e and hone&s;t way, to make up that Breach.</P>
<P>The Affinity of the Matter, leads me next to give an account <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of <HI>Sweden</HI> gets the Pro|te&s;tant Churches in <HI>Sile&s;ia</HI> to be re&s;tored to them.</NOTE> of the Differences, between the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and the Court of <HI>Vienna:</HI> That King, after he had been a very heavy Gue&s;t in <HI>Saxony,</HI> came to under&s;tand, that the Prote&s;tants in <HI>Sile&s;ia</HI> had their Churches, and the free Exerci&s;e of their Religion, &s;tipulated to them by the Peace of <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> and that the Crown of <HI>Sweden</HI> was the Guarantee, for ob&s;erving this: The&s;e Churches were ta|ken from them; &s;o the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> was in ju&s;tice bound, to &s;ee to the ob&s;erving of that Article; he very readily embraced this opportunity, which had been long neglected, or forgotten by his Father. When this was fir&s;t repre&s;ented to the Court of <HI>Vienna,</HI> it was treated there with much Scorn: And Count <HI>Zabor,</HI> one of the Mini&s;ters of that Court, &s;poke of the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> in a &s;tyle, that he thought furni&s;hed him with a ju&s;t preten&s;ion to demand, that he &s;hould be &s;ent to him, to be puni&s;hed, as he thought fit: this was &s;oon yielded; the Count was &s;ent to the King, and made &s;uch an humble Submi&s;&s;ion to him, as was accepted: But the Demand, for re&s;toring the Churches, was a matter of hard di|ge&s;tion, to a bigotted and haughty Court. The King of <HI>Sweden</HI> had a great Army at hand, and he threatned an immediate Rup|ture, if this Demand was not agreed to, without delay: In this, he was &s;o po&s;itive, that the Imperial Court at la&s;t yielded, they being then in no condition, to re&s;i&s;t a warlike Prince, and an Ar|my, hardened by an exact Di&s;cipline, and the Fatigues of a long War: &s;o that every thing that was demanded, pur&s;uant to that Article of the Treaty of <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> was agreed to be performed, within a prefixed time: And upon that, the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> marched his Army, under the mo&s;t regular Di&s;cipline thro' <HI>Sile&s;ia,</HI> as had been agreed, into <HI>Poland.</HI> The <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> made great oppo|&s;ition, to the performance of what had been &s;tipulated; but the Imperial Court would not provoke a Prince, who they thought was &s;eeking a colour, to break with them: So, by the day pre|fixed, all the Churches were re&s;tored, to the Prote&s;tants in <HI>Sile&s;ia&punc;</HI>
<PB N="484" REF="510">
Upon this, he was highly magnified, and great Endeavours were again u&s;ed, to engage him in the Alliance; but he was &s;o &s;et again&s;t the <HI>Czar,</HI> whom he de&s;igned to dethrone, that nothing could then divert him from it: Yet he &s;o far entred into the In|tere&s;ts of Religion, that, as he wrote to the King of <HI>France,</HI> de|&s;iring him not to oppo&s;e the King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> in his Preten&s;ions on <HI>Neufcha&s;tel;</HI> he al&s;o wrote to the Cantons, de&s;iring them to promote and &s;upport them. The Cantons &s;eeing tho&s;e Characters of Zeal in him, &s;ent a <HI>French</HI> Gentleman of Quality to him, the Marquis <HI>de Rochegude,</HI> to let him know what regard they had to his Recommendations, and to de&s;ire him to interpo&s;e his good Offices, with the King of <HI>France,</HI> for &s;etting at liberty about three hun|dred Per&s;ons, who were condemned to the Galleys, and treated mo&s;t cruelly in them, upon no other pretence, but becau&s;e they would not change their Religion, and had endeavoured to make their e&s;cape out of <HI>France:</HI> He received this Me&s;&s;age with a par|ticular Civility, and immediately complied with it; ordering his Mini&s;ter, at the Court of <HI>France,</HI> to make it his de&s;ire to that King, that the&s;e Confe&s;&s;ors might be delivered to him: But the Mini&s;ters of <HI>France</HI> &s;aid, that was a point of the King's Govern|ment at home, in which he could not &s;uffer foreign Princes to meddle: He &s;eemed &s;en&s;ible of this neglect, and it was hoped, that when his Affairs could admit of it, he would expre&s;s a due re&s;entment of it.</P>
<P>To end all the Affairs of <HI>Germany,</HI> for this Year, at once; I <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Sedition in <HI>Hambo|rough.</HI></NOTE> mu&s;t mention a Quarrel, rai&s;ed in <HI>Hamborough,</HI> between &s;ome private Per&s;ons, one of whom was a <HI>Lutheran</HI> Mini&s;ter; which created a great divi&s;ion in that City. One &s;ide was protected by the Senate, which gave &s;o great a Di&s;gu&s;t to the other &s;ide, that it was like to end in a Revolt again&s;t the Magi&s;trates, and a Civil War within the Town: And it being known, that the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> had; for many Years, had an eye on that Place, the neighbouring Princes apprehended, that he might take advantage from tho&s;e Commotions, or that the weaker &s;ide might chu&s;e ra|ther, to fall under his power, than under the Revenges of the adver&s;e Party. The Kings of <HI>Sweden</HI> and <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> with the Hou&s;e of <HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> re&s;olved therefore to &s;end Troops thither, to quiet this Di&s;traction, and to cha&s;tize the more refractory; while the Emperor's Mini&s;ters, together with the Queen's, endeavoured to accommodate Matters, without &s;uffering them to run to Extre|mities.</P>
<P>It remains, that I give an account of the Campaign in <HI>Flanders:</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cam|paign in <HI>Flanders</HI></NOTE> The <HI>French</HI> kept clo&s;e within their Po&s;ts; tho' the Duke of <HI>Marl|borough</HI> often drew out his Troops, to &s;ee if that could provoke

them; but they were re&s;olved not to fight on equal Terms; and it was not thought advi&s;eable to attempt the forcing their Po&s;ts: they lay, for &s;ome Months, looking on one another; but both Armies had behind them &s;uch a &s;afe and plentiful conveyance of Provi&s;ions, that no want of any &s;ort could oblige either &s;ide to di&s;lodge. The Duke of <HI>Vendome</HI> had Orders, to &s;end De|tachments, to reinforce Mare&s;chal <HI>Villars,</HI> in lieu of tho&s;e De|tachments, that he had been ordered to &s;end to <HI>Provence.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> &s;eemed to wonder, that the Confederates lay &s;o quiet, and gave the Duke of <HI>Vendome</HI> no di&s;turbance; and that they could not, at lea&s;t, oblige him to keep all his Army toge|ther: At la&s;t the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> decamped, and moved towards <HI>French Flanders:</HI> The <HI>French</HI> decamped, about the &s;ame time, but lodged them&s;elves again in &s;uch a &s;afe Camp, that he could not force them into any Action: Nor was his Army &s;o nu|merous, as to &s;pare a Body to undertake a Siege, by that means to draw them to a Battle; &s;o that the Campaign was carried on there, in a very inoffen&s;ive manner, on both &s;ides: And thus Matters &s;tood in the Continent, every where this Sea&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>France</HI> &s;et out no Fleet this Year, and yet, we never had <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs at Sea.</NOTE> greater Lo&s;&s;es on that Element: The Prince's Council was very unhappy, in the whole conduct of the Cruizers and Convoys: The Merchants made heavy Complaints, and not without rea&s;on: Convoys were &s;ometimes denied them; and when they were granted, they were often delayed beyond the time limited, for the Merchants to get their Ships in readine&s;s: and the &s;ailing Orders were &s;ometimes &s;ent them &s;o unhappily (but as many &s;aid, &s;o treacherou&s;ly) that a <HI>French</HI> Squadron was then laying in their way, to intercept them. This was liable to very &s;evere Reflections: For many of the Convoys, as well as the Merchant-Ships, were taken: And to compleat the Misfortunes of our Affairs at Sea, this Year, when Sir <HI>Cloude&s;ly Shovel</HI> was &s;ailing home, with the great Ships, by an unaccountable Carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and Security, he, and two other capital Ships, ran foul upon tho&s;e Rocks, beyond the <HI>Land's End,</HI> known by the name of the <HI>Bi&s;hop and his Clerks;</HI> and they were in a Minute broke to pieces; &s;o that not a Man of them e&s;caped. It was dark, but there was no Wind, other|wi&s;e the whole Fleet had peri&s;hed with them: All the re&s;t tack'd in time, and &s;o they were &s;aved. Thus one of the greate&s;t Sea|men of the Age was lo&s;t, by an Error in his own Profe&s;&s;ion, and a great Mi&s;reckoning; for he had lain by, all the Day be|fore, and &s;et &s;ail at Night, believing, that next Morning, he would have time enough, to guard again&s;t running on tho&s;e Rocks; but he was &s;wallowed up within three Hours after.</P>
<P><PB N="486" REF="512">
This was the State of our Affairs abroad, both by Sea and Land. Things went at home, in their ordinary Channels: But the Con|duct, with relation to <HI>Scotland,</HI> was more unaccountable: For <NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceedings with relation to <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> whereas, it might have been rea&s;onably expected, that the Ma|nagement, of the newly united Part of this I&s;land, &s;hould have been particularly taken care of, &s;o as to give no ju&s;t di&s;ta&s;te to the <HI>Scots,</HI> nor offer Handles to tho&s;e, who were &s;till endeavour|ing to inflame that Nation, and to encrea&s;e their Aver&s;ion to the Union: Things were, on the contrary, &s;o ordered, as if the De|&s;ign had been to contrive Methods, to exa&s;perate the Spirits of the People there. Though the Management of the <HI>Scotch</HI> Revenue was to fall into the Lord Trea&s;urer's hands, on the fir&s;t of <HI>May,</HI> no care was taken to have all the Commi&s;&s;ions ready at the Day, with new Officers to &s;erve in them: So that the whole Trade of <HI>Scotland</HI> was &s;top'd, for almo&s;t two Months, for want of Orders, to put it into the new cour&s;e, in which it was to be carried on. Three Months pa&s;&s;ed, before the Equivalent was &s;ent to <HI>Scotland:</HI> And when Wines and other Merchandize were imported into <HI>England</HI> from thence, Seizures were every where made, and this was managed with a particular Affectation of Roughne&s;s. All the&s;e things heightened the Prejudices, with which that Nation had been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, again&s;t the Union: It was al&s;o known, that many Me&s;&s;ages pa&s;&s;ed, between <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>France;</HI> and that there were many Meetings, and much Con&s;ultation, among the di&s;contented Party there; a great Body appeared openly for the Pretended Prince of <HI>Wales;</HI> and celebrated his Birth-day very publickly, both at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and in other Places of the King|dom; and it was openly talked, that there was now an Opportu|nity, that was not to be lo&s;t, of invading the Kingdom, tho' with a &s;mall Force; and that a general Concurrence, from the Body of that Nation, might be depended on: The&s;e things were done, in &s;o bare&s;aced a manner, that no check being given to them, nor Enquiry made after them, by tho&s;e who were in the Govern|ment, it gave occa&s;ion to many melancholy Speculations. The Management from <HI>England</HI> looked, like a thing concerted, to heighten that Di&s;temper; and the whole Conduct of the Fleet afforded great Cau&s;e of Jealou&s;y.</P>
<P>But to open this, as clearly as it has yet appeared to me, I mu&s;t give an account of a new Scene at Court. It was ob&s;erved, that <NOTE PLACE="marg">A new Pa$$y at Court</NOTE> Mr. <HI>Harley,</HI> who had been for &s;ome Years Secretary of State, had gained great Credit with the Queen, and began to &s;et up for him|&s;elf, and to act no more under the Direction of the Lord Trea&s;urer: There was one of the Bedchamber Women, who, being nearly re|lated to the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> had been taken care of by
<PB N="487" REF="513">
her, together with her whole Family (for they were fallen low) in a mo&s;t particular manner. She brought her not only into that Po&s;t, but &s;he had treated her with &s;uch a Confidence, that it had introduced her into a high degree of Favour with the Queen: Which, for &s;ome Years, was con&s;idered as an effect of the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Marlborough</HI>'s Credit with Her; &s;he was al&s;o nearly related to Mr. <HI>Harley;</HI> and they two entred into a clo&s;e Corre&s;pondence. She learned the Arts of a Court, and ob&s;erved the Queen's Tem|per, with &s;o much Application, that &s;he got far into her Heart: And &s;he imployed all her Credit, to e&s;tabli&s;h <HI>Harley</HI> in the &s;u|preme Confidence with the Queen, and to alienate her Affections from the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> who &s;tudied no other method of pre&s;erving her Favour, but by pur&s;uing the true Intere&s;t of the Queen, and of the Kingdom. It was &s;aid, that the Prince was brought into the Concert; and that he was made to appre|hend, that he had too &s;mall a Share in the Government, and that he was &s;hut out from it, by the great Power, that the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> and the Lord Trea&s;urer had drawn into their hands: It was &s;aid, all depended on them, that the Queen was only a Cypher in the Government, that &s;he was in the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Marlborough</HI>'s hands, as her Affairs were in the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI>'s: It was likewi&s;e talked among tho&s;e, who made their Court to the new Favourites, that there was not now a <HI>Jaco|bite</HI> in the Nation, that all were for the Queen, and that, without doubt, &s;he would reign out peaceably her whole Life; but &s;he needed not concern her&s;elf for a <HI>German</HI> Family: The&s;e Di&s;|cour&s;es began to break out, and gave &s;ad Thoughts to tho&s;e to whom they were brought. This went on too long, little re|garded; the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Marlborough</HI> &s;eemed &s;ecure of her In|tere&s;t in the Queen, and &s;hewed no Jealou&s;y of a Favour, to which her&s;elf gave the fir&s;t ri&s;e. This was the State of the Court at the opening of the Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament.</P>
<P>There were, at that time, three Bi&s;hopricks vacant: <HI>Trelawny</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Promotions in the Church.</NOTE> had been removed, the Summer before, from <HI>Exeter</HI> to <HI>Win|che&s;ter;</HI> which gave great di&s;gu&s;t to many, he being con&s;iderable for nothing, but his Birth, and his Intere&s;t in <HI>Cornwall.</HI> The Lord Trea&s;urer had engaged him&s;elf to him, and he was &s;en&s;ible that he was much reflected upon for it. But he, to &s;often the Cen|&s;ure that this brought on him, had promi&s;ed, that, for the fu|ture, Preferments &s;hould be be&s;towed on Men well principled, with relation to the pre&s;ent Con&s;titution, and on Men of Me|rit. The Queen, without regarding this, did &s;ecretly engage her&s;elf to Dr. <HI>Blackhall</HI> for <HI>Exeter;</HI> and <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> (being at the &s;ame time void, by the Death of Dr. <HI>Stratford)</HI> to Sir <HI>William

Dawes</HI> for that See: The&s;e Divines were in them&s;elves Men of Value and Worth, but their Notions were all on the other &s;ide; They had &s;ubmitted to the Government, but they, at lea&s;t <HI>Black|hall,</HI> &s;eemed to condemn the Revolution, and all that had been done pur&s;uant to it. <HI>Dawes</HI> al&s;o was looked on, as an a&s;piring Man, who would &s;et him&s;elf at the head of the Tory Party: &s;o this Nomination gave a great di&s;gu&s;t. To qualify this a little, <HI>Patrick,</HI> the pious and learned Bi&s;hop of <HI>Ely,</HI> dying at this time, the Queen advanced <HI>More</HI> from <HI>Norwich</HI> thither; and Dr. <HI>Trim|nell,</HI> a worthy Per&s;on in all re&s;pects, was named for <HI>Norwich:</HI> yet this did not quiet the Unea&s;ine&s;s, many were under, by rea|&s;on of the other Nominations, which &s;eemed to flow from the Queen her&s;elf, and &s;o di&s;covered her Inclinations. To prevent the ill effects, that this might have, in the approaching Se&s;&s;ion, &s;ome of the Eminent Members of the Hou&s;e of Commons were called to a Meeting, with the Dukes of <HI>Somer&s;et</HI> and <HI>Devon&s;hire:</HI> The&s;e Lords a&s;&s;ured them, in the Queen's name, that &s;he was very &s;en&s;ible of the Services, the Whigs did her; and tho' &s;he had engaged her&s;elf &s;o far, with relation to tho&s;e two Bi&s;hopricks, that &s;he could not recall the Promi&s;es &s;he had made, yet for the future, &s;he was re&s;olved to give them full content. But while this was &s;aid to &s;ome Whigs, <HI>Harley</HI> and his Friends <HI>St. John</HI> and <HI>Harcourt,</HI> took great pains on the Leaders of the Tories (in particular on <HI>Hanmer, Bromley</HI> and <HI>Freeman)</HI> to engage them in the Queen's Intere&s;ts: a&s;&s;uring them, that her Heart was with them, that &s;he was weary of the Tyranny of the Whigs, and long'd to be deliver'd from it. But they were not wrought on, by that Management; they either mi&s;tru&s;ted it, as done only to en&s;nare them, or they had other Views, which they did not think &s;it to own. This Double-dealing came to be known, and gave occa&s;ion to much jealou&s;y and di&s;tru&s;t. A little before the Se&s;|&s;ion was opened, an eminent Misfortune happen'd at Sea: A Convoy, of five Ships of the Line of Battel, was &s;ent to <HI>Portugal,</HI> to guard a great Fleet of Merchant-Ships; and they were ordered to &s;ail, as if it had been by concert, at a time when a Squadron from <HI>Dunkirk</HI> had joined another from <HI>Bre&s;t,</HI> and lay in the way, waiting for them. Some Adverti&s;ements were brought to the Admiralty, of this Conjunction, but they were not believed. When the <HI>French</HI> &s;et upon them, the Convoy did their part very gallantly, tho' the Enemy were three to one; one of the Ships was blown up, three of them were taken, &s;o that only one e&s;caped, much &s;hattered: But they had fought &s;o long, that mo&s;t of the Merchant-men had time to get away, and &s;ailed on, not being pur&s;ued, and &s;o got &s;afe to <HI>Lisbon.</HI> This, coming almo&s;t at the

&s;ame time with the Misfortune, that happened to <HI>Shovel,</HI> the Se&s;|&s;ion was begun with a melancholy Face; and a Di&s;pute, upon their Opening, had almo&s;t put them into great Di&s;order.</P>
<P>It was generally thought, that tho' this was a Parliament, that had now &s;ate two Years, yet it was a new Parliament, by rea&s;on it had been let fall, and was revived by a Proclamation, as was formerly told: And the con&s;equence of this was, that tho&s;e who had got Places, were to go to a new Election. Others maintained, that it could not be a new Parliament, &s;ince it was not &s;ummoned by a new Writ, but by virtue of a Clau&s;e in an Act of Parliament. The Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> upon his coming over, prevailed to have it yielded to be a new Parliament; but <HI>Harley</HI> was for maintaining it to be an old Parliament. The Hou&s;e of Com|mons cho&s;e the &s;ame Speaker over again, and all the u&s;ual Forms, in the fir&s;t beginning of a new Parliament, were ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>The&s;e were no &s;ooner over, than the Complaints of the Admi|ralty <NOTE PLACE="marg">Complaints of the Ad|miralty.</NOTE> were offered to both Hou&s;es: Great Lo&s;&s;es were made, and all was imputed to the Weakne&s;s, or to a wor&s;e Di&s;po&s;ition, in &s;ome, who had great Credit with the Prince, and were believed to govern that whole Matter: For as they were entirely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Prince's Confidence, &s;o when the Prince's Council was divided in their Opinions, the Deci&s;ion was left to the Prince, who un|der&s;tood very little of tho&s;e Matters, and was always determined by others. By this means they were really Lord High Admiral, without being liable to the Law for Errors and Mi&s;carriages. This Council was not a legal Court, warranted by any Law, tho' they a&s;&s;umed that to them&s;elves; being Coun&s;ellors, they were bound to an&s;wer only for their fidelity. The Complaints were feebly ma|naged, at the Bar of the Hou&s;e of Commons; for it was &s;oon un|der&s;tood, that not only the Prince, but the Queen likewi&s;e con|cerned Her&s;elf much in this Matter: And both looked on it as a De&s;ign, levelled at their Authority. Both Whigs and Tories &s;eemed to be at fir&s;t equally zealous in the Matter; but by rea&s;on of the Oppo&s;ition of the Court, all tho&s;e, who intended to recom|mend them&s;elves to favour, abated of their Zeal: Some were ve|hement in their Endeavours to baffle the Complaints: They had great Advantages, from the Merchants managing their Complaints but poorly; &s;ome were frighted, and others were practi&s;ed on, and were carried even to magnify the Conduct of the Fleet, and to make Excu&s;es for all the Misfortunes that had happened. That which had the chief Operation, on the whole Tory Party, was, that it was &s;et round among them, that the De&s;ign of all the&s;e Complaints was, to put the Earl of <HI>Orford</HI> again at the Head of the Fleet: Upon which they all changed their Note, and They, in
<PB N="490" REF="516">
concurrence with tho&s;e, who were in Offices, or pretended to them, managed the Matter &s;o, that it was let fall, very little to their honour. Unkind Remarks were made on &s;ome, who had changed their Conduct upon their being preferred at Court; but the Matter was managed with more Zeal and Courage in the Hou&s;e of Lords, both Whigs and Tories concurring in it.</P>
<P>A Committee was appointed, to examine the Complaints; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Examined by the Hou&s;e of Lords.</NOTE> they called the Merchants, who had &s;igned the Petition, before them; and treated them not with the Scorn, that was very inde|cently offered them by &s;ome of the Hou&s;e of Commons, but with great Patience and Gentlene&s;s: They obliged them, to prove all their Complaints, by Witne&s;&s;es upon Oath. In the Pro&s;ecution of the Enquiry, it appeared, that many Ships of War were not fit|ted out, to be put to Sea, but lay in Port neglected, and in great decay; that Convoys had been often flatly denied the Merchants, and that, when they were promi&s;ed, they were &s;o long delayed, that the Merchants lo&s;t their Markets, were put to great Charge, and, when they had peri&s;hable Goods, &s;uffered great Damage in them: The Cruizers were not order'd to proper Stations in the Channel; and when Convoys were appointed, and were ready to put to Sea, they had not their &s;ailing Orders &s;ent them, till the Enemies Ships were laid in their way, prepared to fall on them, which had often happened. Many Adverti&s;ements, by which tho&s;e Misfortunes might have been prevented, had been offered to the Admiralty, but had not only been neglected by them, but tho&s;e, who offered them, had been ill treated for doing it. The Committee made Report of all this to the Hou&s;e of Lords; upon which, the Lord Trea&s;urer moved, that a Copy of the Report might be &s;ent to the Lord Admiral, which was done, and in a few days an An&s;wer was &s;ent to the Hou&s;e, excu&s;ing, or ju&s;tifying the Conduct, in all the Branches of it. The chief Foundation of the An&s;wer was, that the great Fleets, which were kept in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> obliged us to &s;end away &s;o many of our Ships and Seamen thither, that there was not a &s;ufficient num|ber left, to guard all our Trade; while the Enemy turned all their Forces at Sea into Squadrons, for de&s;troying it; and that all the Ships, that could be &s;pared, from the Publick Service abroad, were imployed to &s;ecure the Trade; the Promi&s;e of Con|voys had been often delayed, by rea&s;on of cro&s;s Winds, and o|ther Accidents, that had hindred the Return of our Men of War longer, than was expected; they being then abroad, convoying other Merchant-Ships: And it was &s;aid, that there was not a &s;uf|ficient number of Ships, for Cruizers and Convoys both. The Paper ended, with &s;ome &s;evere Reflections on the la&s;t Reign, in
<PB N="491" REF="517">
which great Sums were given, for the building of Ships, and yet the Fleet was at that time much dimini&s;hed, and Four Thou&s;and Merchant Ships had been taken during that War: This was be|lieved to have been &s;ugge&s;ted by Mr. <HI>Harley,</HI> on de&s;ign to morti|fy King <HI>William</HI>'s Mini&s;try. Upon reading of this An&s;wer, a new and a fuller Examination of the Particulars was again re|&s;umed, by the &s;ame Committee; and all the Allegations in it were exactly con&s;idered: It appeared, that the half of tho&s;e Sea|men, that the Parliament had provided for, were not employed in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> that many Ships lay idle in Port, and were not made u&s;e of; and that in the la&s;t War, in which it ap|peared there were more Seamen, tho' not more Ships, employed in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> than were now kept there, yet the Trade was &s;o carefully looked after, by Cruizers and Convoys, that few Complaints were then made: and as to the Reflections made on the la&s;t Reign, it was found that not half the Sum, that was named, was given for the building of Ships; and that in&s;tead of the Fleet's being dimini&s;hed, during that War, as had been af|firmed, it was increa&s;ed by above Forty Ships; nor could any proof be given, that four thou&s;and Ships were taken during that War: All the Seamen, who were then taken and exchanged, did not exceed 15000, and in the pre&s;ent War 18000 were already exchanged; and we had 2000 &s;till remaining in our Enemies hands: &s;o much had the Prince been impo&s;ed on, in that Paper, that was &s;ent to the Lords in his name.</P>
<P>When the Examination was ended, and reported to the Hou&s;e, <NOTE PLACE="marg">And laid be|fore the Queen in an Addre&s;s.</NOTE> it was re&s;olved to lay the whole matter before the Queen, in an Addre&s;s; and then the Tories di&s;covered the De&s;ign, that they drove at; for they moved in the Committee, that prepared the Addre&s;s, that the blame of all the Mi&s;carriages might be laid on the Mini&s;try, and on the Cabinet Council. It had been often &s;aid in the Hou&s;e of Lords, that it was not intended, to make any complaint of the Prince him&s;elf; and it not being admitted, that his Council was of a legal Con&s;titution, the complaining of them would be an acknowledging their Authority; therefore the blame could be laid regularly no where, but on the Mini&s;try: This was much pre&s;&s;ed by the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Haver&s;ham.</HI> But to this it was an&s;wered, by the Earl of <HI>Orford,</HI> the Lord <HI>Somers,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Halifax,</HI> that the Hou&s;e ought to lay before the Queen only that, which was made out before them upon Oath: and therefore &s;ince, in the whole Examination, the Mini&s;try, and the Cabinet Council were not once named, they could offer the Queen nothing, to their prejudice. Some of the things complained of, &s;ell on the Navy-Board,
<PB N="492" REF="518">
which was a Body, acting by a legal Authority: The Lords ought to lay before the Queen, &s;uch Mi&s;carriages as were proved to them; and leave it to Her, to find out, on whom the blame ought to be ca&s;t: So far was the Mini&s;try, from appearing to be in fault, that they found &s;everal Adverti&s;ements were &s;ent, by the Secretaries of State, to the Admiralty, that, as appeared afterwards, were but too well grounded, yet the&s;e were neglected by them; and that which rai&s;ed the Clamour the higher, was, that during the Winter there were no Cruizers, laying in the Channel; &s;o that many Ships which had run thro' all Dangers at Sea, were taken in &s;ight of Land, for the Privateers came up boldly to our Ports. All this was dige&s;ted into a full and clear Addre&s;s, laid, by the Hou&s;e, before the Queen: There was a general An|&s;wer made to it, giving A&s;&s;urances, that the Trade &s;hould be care|fully looked to; but nothing el&s;e followed upon it; and the Queen &s;eemed to be highly offended at the whole Proceeding. At this time, an Enquiry likewi&s;e into the Affairs of <HI>Spain</HI> was begun in both Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Peterborough</HI> had received &s;uch po&s;itive Orders re|calling <NOTE PLACE="marg">Enquity into the Affairs of <HI>Spain.</HI></NOTE> him, that tho' he delayed as long as he could, yet at la&s;t he came home in <HI>Augu&s;t:</HI> But the Queen, before &s;he would ad|mit him into her Pre&s;ence, required of him an account of &s;ome Particulars in his Conduct, both in Military Matters, in his Ne|gotiations, and in the Di&s;po&s;al of the Money remitted to him. He made &s;uch general An&s;wers, as gave little &s;atisfaction: But he &s;eemed to re&s;erve the Matter, to a Parliamentary Examination, which was entred upon by both Hou&s;es. All the Tories magnified his Conduct, and &s;tudied to detract from the Earl of <HI>Gallway;</HI> but it was thought, that the Mini&s;try were under &s;ome re&s;traints, with relation to the Earl of <HI>Peterborough,</HI> tho' he did not &s;pare them; which gave occa&s;ion to many to &s;ay, they were afraid of him, and dur&s;t not provoke him. The Whigs, on the other hand, made &s;evere Remarks on his Conduct: The Complaints, that King <HI>Charles</HI> made of him, were read, upon which he brought &s;uch a number of Papers, and &s;o many Witne&s;&s;es to the Bar, to ju&s;tify his Conduct, that after ten or twelve Days, &s;pent wholly in reading Papers, and in hearing Witne&s;&s;es, both Hou&s;es grew equally weary of the Matter; &s;o, without coming to any Conclu|&s;ion, or to any Vote, they let all, that related to him, fall: But that gave them a handle, to con&s;ider the pre&s;ent State of Affairs in <HI>Spain.</HI> It was found, that we had not above half the Troops there, that the Parliament had made provi&s;ion for; and that not above half the Officers, that belonged to tho&s;e Bodies, &s;erved there; this gave the Hou&s;e of Commons a high Di&s;ta&s;te, and it
<PB N="493" REF="519">
was hoped by the Tories, that they &s;hould have carried the Hou&s;e, to &s;evere Votes and warm Addre&s;&s;es on that head; which was much laboured by them, in order to load the Mini&s;try. In this, <HI>Harley</HI> and his Party were very cold and pa&s;&s;ive, and it was ge|nerally believed, that the Matter was privately &s;et on by them: But the Court &s;ent an Explanation of the whole Matter to the Hou&s;e, by which it appeared, that tho', by Death and De&s;ertion, the number of the Troops there was much dimini&s;hed, yet the whole number provided, or at lea&s;t very near it, was &s;ent out of <HI>England.</HI> The Service in <HI>Spain</HI> was much decried; and there was good rea&s;on for it; things there could not be furni&s;hed, but at exce&s;&s;ive Rates, and the Soldiers were generally ill u&s;ed in their Quarters. They were treated very unkindly, not by King <HI>Charles,</HI> but by tho&s;e about him, and by the bigotted <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>During the&s;e Debates, &s;evere things were &s;aid in general, of <NOTE PLACE="marg">1708.</NOTE> the Conduct of Affairs, in both Hou&s;es: It was ob&s;erved, that a va&s;t Army was well &s;upplied in <HI>Flanders,</HI> but that the Intere&s;t of the Nation required, that <HI>Spain</HI> &s;hould be more con&s;idered: It was moved in both Hou&s;es, that the Emperor &s;hould be earne&s;tly applied to, to &s;end Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> into <HI>Spain;</HI> Complaints were al&s;o made of the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> as continuing the War, tho', at the end of the Campaign of 1706, the <HI>French</HI> had offered to yield up <HI>Spain</HI> and the <HI>We&s;t-Indies;</HI> but that was a fal&s;e Sug|ge&s;tion. All the&s;e Heats in the Hou&s;e, after they had got this vent, were allayed: The Queen a&s;&s;ured them, all pa&s;t Errors &s;hould be redre&s;&s;ed for the future; and with repeated Importuni|ties, &s;he pre&s;&s;ed the Emperor to &s;end Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> to <HI>Spain:</HI> That Court delayed to comply in this particular; but &s;ent Count <HI>Staremberg</HI> thither, who had indeed acquired a very high Repu|tation. The Queen entered al&s;o into Engagements with the Emperor, that &s;he would tran&s;port, pay, and furni&s;h all the Troops, that he could &s;pare for his Brother's Service. The&s;e Steps quieted the Di&s;content, the Hou&s;e had expre&s;&s;ed, upon the ill Conduct of Affairs in <HI>Spain;</HI> but upon <HI>Stanhope</HI>'s coming over, he gave a better Pro&s;pect of Affairs there; and he found a readi|ne&s;s, to agree to all the Propo&s;itions, that he was &s;ent over to make. All this while an Act was preparing, both for a better Se|curity to our Trade by Cruizers and Convoys, and for the en|couraging Privateers, particularly in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and in the <HI>South-Sea.</HI> They were to have all they could take, entirely to them&s;elves; the &s;ame Encouragement was al&s;o given to the Cap|tains of the Queen's Ships, with this difference, that the Captains of Privateers were to divide their Capture, according to Agree|ments
<PB N="494" REF="520">
made among them&s;elves; but they left the Di&s;tribution of Prizes, taken by Men of War, to the Queen: who, by Procla|mation, ordered them to be divided into eight Shares; of which the Captain was to have three, unle&s;s he had a &s;uperior Officer over him, in which ca&s;e, the Commodore was to have one of the three; the other five Parts were to be di&s;tributed equally, among the Officers and Mariners of the Ships, put in five diffe|rent Cla&s;&s;es: All the Clau&s;es, that the Merehants de&s;ired, to en|courage Privateers, were readily granted, and it was hoped, that a great Stock would be rai&s;ed to carry on this private War. This pa&s;t without Oppo&s;ition, all concurring in it.</P>
<P>But as to other Matters, the Tories di&s;covered much ill-humour again&s;t the Mini&s;try; which broke out on all occa&s;ions: And the Jealou&s;ies, with which the Whigs were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, made them as cold as the others were hot. This gave the Mini&s;ters great un|ea&s;ine&s;s: They found Mr. <HI>Harley</HI> was endeavouring to &s;upplant them at Court, and to heighten the Jealou&s;ies of the Whigs; for he &s;et it about among the Tories, as well as among the Whigs, that both the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> and the Lord Trea&s;urer were as much inclined, to come into mea&s;ures with the Tories, as the Queen her&s;elf was: This broke out, and was like to have had very ill Effects; it had almo&s;t lo&s;t them the Whigs, tho' it did not bring over the Tories.</P>
<P>At this time two Di&s;coveries were made, very unlucky for <NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;coveries of a Corre|&s;pondence with <HI>France.</HI></NOTE> Mr. <HI>Harley: Tallard</HI> wrote oft to <HI>Chamillard,</HI> but he &s;ent his Letters open, to the Secretary's Office, to be peru&s;ed and &s;ealed up, and &s;o to be conveyed by the way of <HI>Holland:</HI> The&s;e were opened, upon &s;ome Su&s;picion in <HI>Holland;</HI> and it appeared, that one, in the Secretary's Office, put Letters in them, in which, as he offered his Service to the Courts of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>St. Germains,</HI> &s;o he gave an Account of all Tran&s;actions here: In one of the&s;e, he &s;ent a Copy of the Letter, that the Queen was to write, in her own Hand, to the Emperor: And he marked what Parts of the Letter were drawn by the Secretary, and what Additions were made to it, by the Lord Trea&s;urer: This was the Letter, by which the Queen pre&s;&s;ed the &s;ending Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> into <HI>Spain,</HI> and this, if not intercepted, would have been at <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> many Days before it could reach <HI>Vienna.</HI> He, who &s;ent this, wrote, that by this they might &s;ee what Service he could do them, if well encouraged; all this was &s;ent over to the Duke of <HI>Marlbo|rough,</HI> and upon Search, it was found to be writ by one <HI>Gregg,</HI> a Clerk, whom <HI>Harley</HI> had not only entertained, but had taken into a particular Confidence, without Enquiry into the former Parts of his Life; for he was a vicious and a nece&s;&s;itous Per&s;on,
<PB N="495" REF="521">
who had been Secretary to the Queen's Envoy in <HI>Denmark,</HI> but was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by him, for tho&s;e his ill Qualities. <HI>Harley</HI> had made u&s;e of him to get him Intelligence, and he came to tru&s;t him with the Peru&s;al, and the &s;ealing up of the Letters, which the <HI>French</HI> Pri&s;oners, here in <HI>England,</HI> &s;ent over to <HI>France:</HI> And by that means, he got into the method of &s;ending Intelligence thither. He, when &s;eized on, either upon Remor&s;e, or the Hopes of Pardon, confe&s;&s;ed all, and &s;igned his Confe&s;&s;ion; upon that he was tried; he pleaded guilty, and was condemned as a Traitor, for corre&s;ponding with the Queen's Enemies. At the &s;ame time <HI>Valiere</HI> and <HI>Bara,</HI> whom <HI>Harley</HI> had imployed, as his Spies, to go oft over to <HI>Calais,</HI> under the Pretence of bringing him Intelligence, were informed again&s;t, as Spies imployed by <HI>France,</HI> to get Intelligence from <HI>England;</HI> who carried over many Letters to <HI>Calais</HI> and <HI>Bulloign:</HI> and, as was believed, gave &s;uch Infor|mation of our Trade and Convoys, that by their means, we had made our great Lo&s;&s;es at Sea. They were often complained of upon Su&s;picion, but they were always protected by <HI>Harley;</HI> yet the Pre&s;umptions again&s;t them were &s;o violent, that they were at la&s;t &s;eized on and brought up Pri&s;oners. The&s;e Accidents might make <HI>Harley</HI> more earne&s;t, to bring about a change in the Con|duct of Affairs, in which he relied on the Credit of the new Fa|vourite. The Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> and the Lord Trea&s;urer, having di&s;covered many of his Practices, laid them before the Queen: She would believe nothing, that was &s;ugge&s;ted to his prejudice: She denied &s;he had given any Authority, for carry|ing Me&s;&s;ages to the Tories; but would not believe, that he or his Friends had done it, nor would &s;he enter into any Examina|tion of his ill Conduct, and was unea&s;y when &s;he heard it &s;poke of. So the&s;e Lords wrote to the Queen, that they could &s;erve her no longer, if he was continued in that Po&s;t: And on the <HI>Sunday</HI> following, when they were &s;ummoned to a Cabinet Council, they both went to the Queen, and told her, they mu&s;t quit her Ser|vice, &s;ince they &s;aw, &s;he was re&s;olved not to part with <HI>Harley.</HI> She &s;eem'd not much concerned, at the Lord <HI>Godolphin</HI>'s offering to lay down; and it was believed, to be a Part of <HI>Harley</HI>'s new Scheme to remove him; but &s;he was much touched with the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI>'s offering to quit, and &s;tudied, with &s;ome &s;oft Expre&s;&s;ions, to divert him from that Re&s;olution: but he was firm, and &s;he did not yield to them: So they both went away, to the wonder of the whole Court. Immediately after, the Queen went to the Cabinet Council, and <HI>Harley</HI> opened &s;ome Matters, relating to foreign Affairs: The whole Board was very unea&s;y; the Duke of <HI>Somer&s;et</HI> &s;aid, he did not &s;ee how they could deli|berate
<PB N="496" REF="522">
on &s;uch Matters, &s;ince the General was not with them; he repeated this with &s;ome Vehemence, while all the re&s;t looked &s;o cold and &s;ullen, that the Cabinet Council was &s;oon at an end; and the Queen &s;aw, that the re&s;t of her Mini&s;ters, and the chief Officers, were re&s;olved to withdraw from her Service, if &s;he did not recall the Two, that had left it. It was &s;aid, that &s;he would have put all to the hazard, if <HI>Harley</HI> him&s;elf had not apprehended his Danger, and re&s;olved to lay down: The Queen &s;ent the next day for the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> and after &s;ome Expo&s;tulations, &s;he told him, <HI>Harley</HI> &s;hould immediately leave his Po&s;t, which he did within two Days: But the Queen &s;eemed to carry a deep Re&s;entment of his and the Lord <HI>Godolphin</HI>'s Behaviour on this oc|ca&s;ion; and tho' they went on with her Bu&s;ine&s;s, they found they had not her Confidence. The Dutche&s;s of <HI>Marlborough</HI> did, for &s;ome Weeks, ab&s;tain from going to Court, but afterwards that Breach was made up in Appearance, tho' it was little more than an Appearance. Both Hou&s;es of Parliament expre&s;&s;ed a great concern, at this Rupture in the Court; and apprehended the ill Effects it might have: The Commons let the Bill of Sup|ply lie on the Table, tho' it was ordered for that Day: And the Lords ordered a Committee, to examine <HI>Gregg</HI> and the other Pri&s;oners. As <HI>Harley</HI> laid down, both <HI>Harcourt,</HI> then Attorney-General, <HI>Man&s;ell,</HI> the Comptroller of the Hou&s;hold, and <HI>St. John,</HI> the Secretary of War, went and laid down with him. The Queen took much time to con&s;ider, how &s;he &s;hould fill &s;ome of the&s;e Places, but Mr. <HI>Boyle,</HI> Uncle to the Earl of <HI>Burlington,</HI> was pre|&s;ently made Secretary of State.</P>
<P>The Lords, who were appointed to examine <HI>Gregg,</HI> could not <NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> find out much by him; he had but newly begun his De&s;igns of betraying Secrets; and he had no A&s;&s;ociates with him in it: He told them, that all the Papers of State lay &s;o carele&s;sly about the Office, that every one belonging to it, even the Door-keepers, might have read them all. <HI>Harley</HI>'s cu&s;tom was to come to the Office, late on Po&s;t-Nights, and after he had given his Orders, and wrote his Letters, he u&s;ually went away, and left all to be copied out, when he was gone: By that means he came to &s;ee every thing, in particular the Queen's Letter to the Emperor. He &s;aid, he knew the De&s;ign on <HI>Toulon</HI> in <HI>May</HI> la&s;t, but he did not di&s;cover it; for he had not entred on his ill Practices till <HI>October:</HI> This was all he could &s;ay. By the Examination of <HI>Valiere</HI> and <HI>Ba$a,</HI> and of many others, who lived about <HI>Dover</HI> and were imployed by them, a Di&s;covery was made of a con&s;tant Inter|cour&s;e, they were in with <HI>Calais,</HI> under <HI>Harley</HI>'s protection: They often went over with Boats full of Wooll, and brought back
<PB N="497" REF="523">
Brandy; tho' both the Import and Export were &s;everely prohi|bited: They, and tho&s;e who belong'd to the Boats, carried over by them, were well treated on the <HI>French</HI> &s;ide, at the Governor's Hou&s;e, or at the Commi&s;&s;ary's; they were kept there, till their Letters could be &s;ent to <HI>Paris,</HI> and till Returns could be brought back, and were all the while upon free co&s;t: The Order, that was con&s;tantly given them, was, that if an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship came up to them, they &s;hould ca&s;t their Letters into the Sea; but that they &s;hould not do it, when <HI>French</HI> Ships came up to them: &s;o they were looked on, by all on that Coa&s;t, as the Spies of <HI>France.</HI> They u&s;ed to get what Information they could, both of Merchant-Ships, and of the Ships of War, that lay in the <HI>Downs;</HI> and upon that they u&s;ually went over, and it happened that &s;oon after &s;ome of tho&s;e Ships were taken: The&s;e Men, as they were Papi&s;ts, &s;o they behaved them&s;elves very in&s;olently, and boa&s;ted much of their Power and Credit. Complaints had been often made of them, but they were always protected; nor did it appear, that they ever brought any Information of importance to <HI>Harley</HI> but once, when, according to what they &s;wore, they told him, that <HI>Fourbin</HI> was gone from <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> to lie in wait for the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> Fleet; which proved to be true: he both went to watch for them, and he took a great part of the Fleet. Yet, tho' this was the &s;ingle piece of Intelligence that they ever brought, <HI>Harley</HI> took &s;o little notice of it, that he gave no adverti&s;ement to the Ad|miralty, concerning it. This Particular excepted, they only brought over common News, and the <HI>Paris</HI> Gazettes. The&s;e Exa|minations la&s;ted for &s;ome Weeks; when they were ended, a full Re|port was made of them, to the Hou&s;e of Lords; and they ordered the whole Report, with all the Examinations, to be laid before the Queen in an Addre&s;s, in which they repre&s;ented to her the nece&s;&s;i|ty of making <HI>Gregg</HI> a publick Example; upon which he was exe|cuted: He continued to clear all other Per&s;ons of any acce&s;&s;ion to his Crimes, of which he &s;eemed very &s;en&s;ible, and died much bet|ter than he had lived.</P>
<P>A very few days after the breach, that had happened at Court, we were alarmed from <HI>Holland,</HI> with the News of a De&s;ign, of which the <HI>French</HI> made then no Secret; that they were &s;ending the Pretended Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> to <HI>Scotland,</HI> with a Fleet and an Army, to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of that Kingdom. But before I go fur|ther, I will give an account, of all that related to the Affairs of that part of the I&s;land.</P>
<P>The Members, &s;ent from <HI>Scotland,</HI> to both Hou&s;es of Parlia|ment, <NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ $word$ to <HI>Scotland</HI></NOTE> were treated with very particular Marks of Re&s;pect and E&s;teem: and they were Per&s;ons of &s;uch di&s;tinction, that they very

well de&s;erved it. The fir&s;t thing propo&s;ed, in the Hou&s;e of Commons, with relation to them, was to take off the &s;top, that was put on their Trade: It was agreed unanimou&s;ly, to pray the Queen by an Addre&s;s, that &s;he would give order for it; &s;ome de|bate ari&s;ing only, whether it was a matter of Right or of Fa|vour: <HI>Harley</HI> pre&s;&s;ed the la&s;t, to ju&s;tify tho&s;e Proceedings, in which he him&s;elf had &s;o great a &s;hare, as was formerly &s;et forth, and on which others made &s;evere Reflections: But &s;ince all a|greed in the Conclu&s;ion, the di&s;pute concerning the Premi&s;&s;es was &s;oon let fall. After this, a more important Matter was pro|po&s;ed, concerning the Government of <HI>Scotland,</HI> whether it &s;hould continue in a di&s;tinct Privy Council, or not: All the Court was for it; Tho&s;e, who governed <HI>Scotland,</HI> de&s;ired to keep up their Authority there, with the advantage they made by it: and they gave the Mini&s;ters of <HI>England</HI> great a&s;&s;urances, that by their In|fluence, Elections might be &s;o managed as to &s;erve all the Ends of the Court; but they &s;aid, that without due care, the&s;e might be carried &s;o, as to run all the contrary way. This was the &s;e|cret Motive, yet this could not be owned in a publick A&s;&s;embly; &s;o that, which was pretended, was, that many great Families in <HI>Scotland,</HI> with the greate&s;t part of the Highlanders, were &s;o ill affected, that without a watchful Eye, ever intent upon them, they could not be kept quiet: It lay at too great a di&s;tance from <HI>London,</HI> to be governed by Orders &s;ent from thence. To this it was an&s;wered, that by the Circuits of the Ju&s;ticiary Courts, and by Ju&s;tices of Peace, that Country might be well governed, not|with&s;tanding its di&s;tance, as <HI>Wales</HI> and <HI>Cornwall</HI> were. It was carried, upon a Divi&s;ion, by a great Majority, that there &s;hould be only one Privy Council for the whole I&s;land. When it was &s;ent up to the Lords, it met with a great oppo&s;ition there: The Court &s;tood alone; all the Tories, and the much greater part of the Whigs were for the Bill. The Court, &s;eeing the Party for the Bill &s;o &s;trong, was willing to compound the matter; and whereas, by the Bill, the Council of <HI>Scotland</HI> was not to &s;it after the fir&s;t of <HI>May,</HI> the Court moved to have it continued, to the fir&s;t of <HI>October.</HI> It was vi&s;ible that this was propo&s;ed only, in order to the managing Elections for the next Parliament; &s;o the Lords adhered to the Day prefixed in the Bill: But a new De|bate aro&s;e about the Power, given by the Bill to the Ju&s;tices of Peace, which &s;eemed to be an Encroachment on the Juri&s;diction of the Lords <HI>Regalities,</HI> and of the Hereditary <HI>Sheriffs</HI> and <HI>Stewards,</HI> who had the right of trying Criminals, in the fir&s;t in|&s;tance, for fourteen days time: yet it was ordinary, in the ca&s;es of great Crimes and Riots, for the Privy Council to take imme|diate
<PB N="499" REF="525">
cognizance of them, without any regard to the fourteen days; &s;o by this Act, the Ju&s;tices of Peace were only impowered to do that, which the Privy Council u&s;ually did: and except the Occa&s;ion was &s;o great, as to demand a quick di&s;patch, it was not to be doubted, but that the Ju&s;tices of Peace would have great regard to all private Rights; yet &s;ince this had the ap|pearance, of breaking in upon private Rights, this was much in&s;i&s;ted on, by tho&s;e who hoped, by laying a&s;ide the&s;e Powers given to the Ju&s;tices of the Peace, to have gained the main Point of keeping up a Privy Council in <HI>Scotland:</HI> For all the <HI>Scotch</HI> Mini&s;ters &s;aid, the Country would be in great danger, if there were not a &s;u|preme Government &s;till kept up in it: But it &s;eemed an ab&s;urd thing, that there &s;hould be a different Admini&s;tration, where there was but one Legi&s;lature. While <HI>Scotland</HI> had an entire Le|gi&s;lature within it &s;elf, the Nation a&s;&s;embled in Parliament could procure the Correction of Errors in the Admini&s;tration: Whereas now, that it was not a tenth part of the Legi&s;lative Body, if it was &s;till to be kept under a different Admini&s;tration, that Nation could not have Strength enough, to procure a Redre&s;s of its Grievances in Parliament; &s;o they might come to be &s;ubdued and governed as a Province: And the arbitrary way, in which the Council of <HI>Scotland</HI> had proceeded, ever &s;ince King <HI>James</HI> the Fir&s;t's time, but more particularly &s;ince the Re&s;toration, was fre&s;h in memory, and had been no &s;mall Motive, to induce the be&s;t Men of that Na|tion to promote the Union; that they might be delivered from the Tyranny of the Council: And their Hopes would be di&s;appointed, if they were &s;till kept under that Yoke. This Point was in Con|clu&s;ion yielded, and the Bill pa&s;s'd, tho' to the great Di&s;content of the Court; there was a new Court of Exchequer created in <HI>Scotland,</HI> according to the Frame of that Court in <HI>England:</HI> Special Acts were made, for the Elections and the Returns of the Repre&s;entatives, in both Hou&s;es of Parliament; and &s;uch was the Di&s;po&s;ition of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to oblige them, and the Behaviour of the <HI>Scots</HI> was &s;o good and di&s;creet, that every thing that was propo&s;ed for the Good of their Country, was agreed to; both Whigs and Tories vied with one another, who &s;hould &s;hew mo&s;t Care and Concern for the Welfare of that part of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>On the twentieth of <HI>February,</HI> which was but a few days after <NOTE PLACE="marg">A De&s;cent $word$ upon <HI>Scot|land.</HI></NOTE> the Act, di&s;&s;olving the Council in <HI>Scotland,</HI> had pa&s;s'd, we un|der&s;tood there was a Flect prepared in <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> with about twelve Battalions, and a Train of all things nece&s;&s;ary for a De&s;cent in <HI>Scotland:</HI> And a few Days after, we heard that the Pretended Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> was come from <HI>Paris,</HI> with all the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> and <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> that were about him, in order to his Imbarkation.

Surprize was great, for it was not looked for, nor had we a Pro|&s;pect of being able to &s;et out in time a Fleet, able to deal with theirs, which con&s;i&s;ted of Twenty-&s;ix Ships, mo&s;t of them of above forty Guns: But that Providence (which has, on all Occa|&s;ions, directed Matters &s;o happily for our Pre&s;ervation) did appear very &s;ignally in this critical Conjuncture: Our greate&s;t Want was of Seamen, to mann the Fleet; for the Ships were ready to be put to Sea: This was &s;upplied, by &s;everal Fleets of Merchant Ships, that came home at that time, with their Convoys: The Flag Offi|cers were very acceptable to the Seamen, and they be&s;tirred them|&s;elves &s;o effectually, that, with the help of an Embargo, there was a Fleet of above forty Ships, got ready in a fortnight's time, to the &s;urprize of all at home, as well as abroad: The&s;e &s;tood over to <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> ju&s;t as they were imbarking there. Upon the &s;ight of &s;o great a Fleet, <HI>Fourbin,</HI> who commanded the <HI>French</HI> Fleet, &s;ent to <HI>Paris</HI> for new Orders: He him&s;elf was again&s;t venturing out, when they &s;aw a &s;uperior Fleet, ready to engage, or to pur&s;ue them. The King of <HI>France</HI> &s;ent po&s;itive Orders, to pro&s;ecute the De&s;ign: So <HI>Fourbin</HI> (&s;eeing that our Fleet, after it had &s;hewed it&s;elf to them, finding the Tides and Sea run high, as being near the Equinox, had &s;ailed back into the <HI>Downs)</HI> took that occa&s;ion to go out of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> on the eighth of <HI>March:</HI> but contrary Winds <NOTE PLACE="marg">A <HI>Fleet</HI> &s;ail|ed from <HI>Dunkurk.</HI></NOTE> kept him on that Coa&s;t, till the eleventh, and then he &s;et &s;ail with a fair Wind. Our Admiral, Sir <HI>George Bing,</HI> came over again to watch his Motions; and as &s;oon as he under&s;tood, that he had &s;ail'd, which was not till twenty Hours after, he followed him. The <HI>French</HI> de&s;igned to have landed in the <HI>Frith,</HI> but they out|&s;ailed their Point a few Leagues; and by the time, that they had got back to the North Side of the <HI>Frith, Bing</HI> came to the South Side of it, and gave the Signal for coming to an Anchor; this was heard by <HI>Fourbin:</HI> He had &s;ent a Frigate into the <HI>Frith,</HI> to give Signals, which it &s;eems had been agreed on, but no An&s;wers were made. The De&s;ign was to land near <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> where they be|lieved the Ca&s;tle was in &s;o bad a condition, and &s;o ill provided, that it mu&s;t have &s;urrendered upon Summons: And they reckoned, that upon the Reputation of that, the whole Body of the King|dom would have come in to them. But when <HI>Fourbin</HI> under&s;tood, on the thirteenth of <HI>March,</HI> that <HI>Bing</HI> was &s;o near him, he tack'd, and would not &s;tay to venture an Engagement. <HI>Bing</HI> pur&s;ued him, with all the Sail that he could make, but the <HI>French</HI> &s;tood out to Sea; there was &s;ome firing on the Ships, that &s;ailed the heavie&s;t, and the <HI>Salisbury,</HI> a Ship taken from us, and then their Vice-Admiral, was engaged by two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships, and taken without any Re&s;i&s;tance. There were about 500 Land-men on board her, with
<PB N="501" REF="527">
&s;ome Officers and Per&s;ons of Quality, the chief of the&s;e were the Lord <HI>Griffin,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Middleton</HI>'s two Sons. <HI>Bing</HI> (hav|ing lo&s;t &s;ight of the <HI>French,</HI> con&s;idering that the <HI>Frith</HI> was the Station of the greate&s;t Importance, as well as Safety, and was the Place where they de&s;igned to land) put in there, till he could hear what cour&s;e the <HI>French</HI> &s;teered: The Tides ran high, and there was a &s;trong Gale of Wind. Upon the Alarm of the intended De&s;cent, Orders were &s;ent to <HI>Scotland,</HI> to draw all their Forces about <HI>Edinburgh:</HI> The Troops that remained in <HI>England</HI> were ordered to march to <HI>Scotland:</HI> And the Troops in <HI>Ireland</HI> were ordered to march northward, to be ready when called for: There were al&s;o twelve Battalions &s;ent from <HI>O&s;tend</HI> under a good Con|voy, and they lay at the Mouth of the <HI>Tine</HI> till further Orders. Thus all Preparations were made to di&s;&s;ipate that &s;mall Force: But it appeared, that the <HI>French</HI> relied chiefly on the A&s;&s;i&s;tance, that they expected would have come in to them, upon their landing: Of this they &s;eemed &s;o well a&s;&s;ured, that the King of <HI>France</HI> &s;ent In&s;tructions, to his Mini&s;ters in all the Courts, that <NOTE PLACE="marg">Reports &s;pread by the <HI>French.</HI></NOTE> admitted of them, to be publi&s;hed every where, that the Pre|tended Prince being invited by his Subjects, chiefly tho&s;e of <HI>Scot|land,</HI> to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Throne of his Ance&s;tors, the King had &s;ent him over at their De&s;ire, with a Fleet and Army to a&s;&s;i&s;t him: That he was re&s;olved to pardon all tho&s;e, who &s;hould come in to him, and he would trouble none upon the account of Re|ligion: Upon his being re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, the King would give Peace to the re&s;t of <HI>Europe.</HI> When the&s;e Mini&s;ters received the&s;e Di|rections, they had likewi&s;e Advice &s;ent them, which they pub|li&s;hed both at <HI>Rome, Venice,</HI> and in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> that the <HI>French</HI> had, before this Expedition was undertaken, &s;ent over &s;ome Ships with Arms and Ammunition to <HI>Scotland:</HI> And that there was already an Army on foot there, that had proclaimed this Pre|tended Prince, King. It was &s;omewhat extraordinary to &s;ee &s;uch eminent Fal&s;hoods publi&s;hed all <HI>Europe</HI> over: They al&s;o affirmed, that Ho&s;tages were &s;ent from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>Paris,</HI> to &s;ecure the ob|&s;erving the Engagements, they had entred into; tho' all this was Fiction and Contrivance.</P>
<P>The <HI>States</HI> were &s;truck with great Apprehen&s;ions, &s;o were all the Allies; for tho' they were &s;o long accu&s;tomed to the cunning Practices of the Court of <HI>France,</HI> yet this was an Original; and therefore it was generally concluded, that &s;o &s;mall an Army, and &s;o weak a Fleet would not have been &s;ent, but upon great A&s;&s;u|rances of A&s;&s;i&s;tance, not only from <HI>Scotland,</HI> but from <HI>England:</HI> And upon this Occa&s;ion, &s;evere Reflections were made, both on the Conduct of the Admiralty, and on that Tract of Corre&s;pon|dence

lately di&s;covered, that was managed under <HI>Harley</HI>'s Pro|tection: And on the great Breach, that was &s;o near the disjoint|ing all our Affairs, but a few Days before. The&s;e things, when put together, filled Men's Minds with Thoughts of no ea&s;y Di|ge&s;tion.</P>
<P>The Parliament was &s;itting, and the Queen, in a Speech to <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia|ment &s;tands firmly by the Queen.</NOTE> both Hou&s;es, communicated to them the Adverti&s;ements &s;he had received: Both Hou&s;es made Addre&s;&s;es to Her, giving her full a&s;|&s;urance of their adhering &s;tedfa&s;tly to her, and to the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion: And mixed with the&s;e broad Intimations, of their Apprehen&s;ions of Treachery at home. They pa&s;&s;ed al&s;o two Bills; the one, that the Abjuration might be tendred to all Per|&s;ons, and that &s;uch as refu&s;ed it, &s;hould be in the condition of convict Recu&s;ants: By the other, they &s;u&s;pended the <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> Act till <HI>October,</HI> with relation to Per&s;ons taken up by the Government upon Su&s;picion: And the Hou&s;e of Commons, by a Vote, engaged to make good to the Queen, all the extraordi|nary Charge, this Expedition might put her to.</P>
<P>A Fortnight went over, before we had any News of the <HI>French</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>French</HI> Fl$span$ a$span$ <HI>Dunkirk.</HI></NOTE> Fleet: Three of their Ships landed near the Mouth of <HI>Spey,</HI> only to refre&s;h them&s;elves; for the Ships being &s;o filled with Land|men, there was a great want of Water: At la&s;t all their Ships got &s;afe into <HI>Dunkirk:</HI> The Land-men either died at Sea, or were &s;o ill, that all the Ho&s;pitals in <HI>Dunkirk</HI> were filled with them. It was reckoned, that they lo&s;t above 4000 Men, in this unaccount|able Expedition: Forthey were above a Month to&s;&s;ed in a very tem|pe&s;tuous Sea. Many &s;u&s;pected Per&s;ons were taken up in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and &s;ome few in <HI>England:</HI> But further Di&s;coveries of their Cor|re&s;pondents were not then made. If they had landed, it might have had an ill effect on our Affairs, chiefly with relation to all Paper Credit: And if by this, the Remittances to <HI>Piedmont, Ca|talonia,</HI> and <HI>Portugal</HI> had been &s;top'd, in &s;o critical a Sea&s;on, that might have had fatal Con&s;equences abroad: For if we had been put into &s;uch a Di&s;order at home, that Foreign Princes could no more reckon on our A&s;&s;i&s;tance, they might have been di&s;po&s;ed to hearken to the Propo&s;itions, that the King of <HI>France</HI> would then have probably made to them. So that, the total defeating of this De&s;ign, without its having the lea&s;t ill effect on our Affairs, or our lo&s;ing one &s;ingle Man in the little Engagement, we had with the Enemy, is always to be reckoned as one of tho&s;e happy Provi|dences, for which we have much to an&s;wer.</P>
<P>The Queen &s;eemed much alarmed with this Matter, and &s;aw with what Fal&s;hoods &s;he had been abu&s;ed, by tho&s;e who pre|tended to a&s;&s;ure her, there was not now a <HI>Jacobite</HI> in the Nation:
<PB N="503" REF="529">
One Variation in her Style was now ob&s;erved: She had never, in any Speech, mentioned the Revolution, or tho&s;e, who had been concerned in it: And many of tho&s;e, who made a con&s;iderable figure about her, &s;tudied, tho' again&s;t all Sen&s;e and Rea&s;on, to di&s;tingui&s;h her Title from the Revolution: It was plainly founded on it, and on nothing el&s;e. In the Speeches &s;he now made, &s;he named the Revolution twice: And &s;aid &s;he would look on tho&s;e concerned in it, as the &s;urest to her Intere&s;ts: She al&s;o fixed a new De&s;ignation on the Pretended Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and called him the Pretender; and he was &s;o called in a new Set of Ad|dre&s;&s;es, which, upon this occa&s;ion, were made to the Queen: And I intend to follow the Precedent, as often as I may have oc|ca&s;ion hereafter to mention him. The Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament was clo&s;ed in <HI>March,</HI> &s;oon after defeating the De&s;ign of the De&s;cent: It was di&s;&s;olved in <HI>April</HI> by Proclamation, and the Writs were i&s;&s;ued out, for the Elections of a new Parliament, which rai&s;ed that Ferment over the Nation, that was u&s;ual on &s;uch occa&s;ions. The ju&s;t Fears and vi&s;ible Dangers, to which the Attempt of the Inva&s;ion had expo&s;ed the Nation, produced very good Effects: For the Elections did, for the mo&s;t part, fall on Men well affected to the Government, and zealou&s;ly &s;et again&s;t the Pretender.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the State of Affairs at home was well &s;ettled, the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The De|$$gn of the Campaign are con|certed.</NOTE> Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> went over to <HI>Holland,</HI> and there Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> met him: Being &s;ent by the Emperor, to concert with him and the <HI>States,</HI> the Operations of the Campaign; from the <HI>Hague,</HI> they both went to <HI>Hanover,</HI> to &s;ettle all Matters relating to the Empire, and to engage the Elector to return, to command the Army on the Upper <HI>Rhine.</HI> Every thing was fixed: Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> went back to <HI>Vienna,</HI> and was obliged to return by the beginning of <HI>June;</HI> for the Campaign was then to be opened every where.</P>

<P>About this time, 6000 Men were embarked at <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> in order to be &s;ent over to <HI>Portugal:</HI> But they were ordered to lie for &s;ome time on the Coa&s;t of <HI>France,</HI> all along from <HI>Bulloigne</HI> to <HI>Dieppe,</HI> in order to force a Diver&s;ion, we hoping, that this would oblige the <HI>French</HI> to draw &s;ome of their Troops out of <HI>Flanders,</HI> for the Defence of their Coa&s;t: This had no great effect, and the Appearance that the <HI>French</HI> made, gave our Men &s;uch Apprehen&s;ions of their Strength, that tho' they once begun to land their Men, yet they &s;oon returned back to their Ships: But as their Behaviour was not a little cen&s;ured, &s;o the State of the War in <HI>Flanders,</HI> made it nece&s;&s;ary to have a greater Force at <HI>O&s;tend.</HI> They were, upon this, ordered to come and land there: <NOTE PLACE="marg">A new Sup|ply &s;ent to <HI>O&s;tend.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Earl,</HI> who commanded them, came out and took a Po&s;t at <HI>Lef|fingen,</HI> that lay on the Canal, which went from <HI>Newport</HI> to <HI>Bruges,</HI> to &s;ecure the Pa&s;&s;age of a great Convoy of 800 Waggons, that were to be carried from <HI>O&s;tend</HI> to the Army: If that had been intercepted, the Siege mu&s;t have been rai&s;ed: For the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> had &s;ent &s;ome Ammunition from his Army, to carry on the Siege, and he could &s;pare no more: He began to de&s;pair of the Undertaking, and &s;o prepared his Friends to look for the rai&s;ing the Siege, being in great Apprehen&s;ions concerning this Convoy; upon which, the whole Succe&s;s of this Enterprize depended: He &s;ent <HI>Webb,</HI> with a Body of 6000 Men to &s;ecure the Convoy.</P>

But when the <HI>French</HI> advanced, our Men fired upon them, both in Front and from the Coppices, with that Fury, and with &s;uch Succe&s;s, that they began to run; and tho' their Officers did all that was po&s;&s;ible to make them &s;tand, they could not prevail: So, after they had lo&s;t about 6000 Men, they marched back to <HI>Bruges: Webb</HI> dur&s;t not leave the advantageous Ground he was in, to pur&s;ue them, being &s;o much inferiour in number. So unequal an Action, and &s;o &s;hameful a Flight, with &s;o great Lo&s;s, was looked on as the mo&s;t extraordinary thing, that had happened during the whole War: And it encouraged the one &s;ide, as much as it di&s;pirited the other. Many Reproaches pa&s;&s;ed on this occa&s;ion, between the <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> the latter, who had &s;uffered the mo&s;t, blaming the former for abandoning them: This, which is the ordinary con&s;equence of all great Misfortunes, was not &s;oon quieted.</P>

By the means of the&s;e Supplies, the Siege was carried on &s;o effectually, that by the end of <HI>October</HI> the Town capitulated: Mare&s;chal <HI>Boufflers</HI> retiring into the Citadel, with 6000 Men.

Whe|ther the notice of the Feint, that the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> gave out of his De&s;ign on <HI>Ghendt,</HI> occa&s;ioned the <HI>French</HI> drawing off their Cannon, and their being &s;o &s;ecure, that they &s;eemed to have no Apprehen&s;ions of his true De&s;igns, was not yet certainly known: But the abandoning tho&s;e Lines, on which they had been working for many Weeks, was a Surprize to all the World: Their Councils &s;eemed to be weak, and the Execution of them was wor&s;e: So that they, who were &s;o long the Terror, were now become the Scorn of the World.</P>

This was a great Conque&s;t; the noble&s;t, the riche&s;t, and the &s;tronge&s;t Town in tho&s;e Provinces, was thus reduced: And the mo&s;t regular Citadel in <HI>Europe,</HI> fortified and furni&s;hed at a va&s;t <NOTE PLACE="marg">$para$</NOTE> Expence, was taken without firing one Cannon again&s;t it.

All the &s;eve|ral Methods the <HI>French</HI> had u&s;ed, to give a Diver&s;ion, had proved ineffectual: But that, in which the Ob&s;ervers of Providence re|joiced mo&s;t, was the &s;ignal Character of a particular Ble&s;&s;ing on this Siege: It was all the whole time a rainy Sea&s;on, all <HI>Europe</HI> over, and in all the neighbouring Places; yet during the Siege of the Town, it was dry and fair about it: And on tho&s;e Days of Capitulation, in which time was allowed for the Garri&s;on to march into the Citadel, it rained; but as &s;oon as the&s;e were elap&s;ed, &s;o that they were at liberty to be&s;iege the Citadel, fair Weather re|turned, and continued till it was taken.</P>

The Burghers did not de&s;erve &s;o good U&s;age; but it was thought fit, to try how far gentle Treatment could prevail on them, and overcome their Perver&s;ene&s;s: And indeed it may be thought, that they had &s;uffered &s;o much by their Treachery, that they were &s;ufficiently puni&s;hed for it: <HI>Ghendt</HI> was delivered to the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> on the la&s;t of <HI>December</HI> N.

But the&s;e Lo&s;&s;es by Land, were well made up by the Succe&s;&s;es of our Fleet: <HI>Sardinia</HI> was reduced, after a very feeble and &s;hort Struggle: The Plenty of the I&s;land made the Conque&s;t the more con&s;iderable at that time, for in <HI>Catalonia</HI> they were much &s;traitened for want of Provi&s;ions, which were now &s;upplied from <HI>Sardinia.</HI> Towards the end of the Campaign, the Fleet, with a Thou&s;and Land-men on board, came before <HI>Minorca,</HI> and in a few Days made them|&s;elves Ma&s;ters of that I&s;land, and of tho&s;e Forts that commanded <HI>Port Mahon,</HI> the only valuable thing in that I&s;land: all was car|ried after a very faint Re&s;i&s;tance, the Garri&s;ons &s;hewing either great Cowardice, or great Inclinations to King <HI>Charles.</HI> By this, our Fleet had got a &s;afe Port, to lie in and refit, and to retire into on all occa&s;ions; for till then we had no place nearer than <HI>Lisbon:</HI> this was &s;uch an Advantage to us, as made a great Impre&s;&s;ion on all the Princes and States in <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>At this time the Pope began to threaten the Emperor with Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical <NOTE PLACE="marg">The $span$</NOTE> Cen&s;ures, and a War, for po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing him&s;elf of <HI>Com|machio,</HI> and for taking Quarters in the Papal Territories: He le|vied Troops, and went often to review them, not without the Affectation of &s;hewing him&s;elf a General, as if he had been again to draw the Sword, as St. <HI>Peter</HI> did: He opened <HI>Sixtus</HI> the Fifth's Trea&s;ure, and took out of it 500,000 Crowns for this Ser|vice: Many were afraid, that this War &s;hould have brought the Emperor's Affairs into a new Entanglement; for the Court of <HI>France</HI> laid hold of this Rupture, and to inflame it, &s;ent Mare&s;chal <HI>T$&s;&s;e</HI> to <HI>Rome,</HI> to encourage the Pope, with great A&s;&s;urances of
<PB N="513" REF="539">
Support. He was al&s;o ordered to try, if the Great Duke and the Republicks of <HI>Venice</HI> and <HI>Genoa,</HI> could be engaged in an Alliance, again&s;t the Imperiali&s;ts.</P>
<P>The Emperor bore all the Pope's Threats, with great patience, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> took <HI>Exilles</HI> and <HI>Fene&s;trella</HI></NOTE> till the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> ended the Campaign: That Duke, at the fir&s;t opening of it, marched into <HI>Savoy,</HI> from whence it was thought his De&s;igns were upon <HI>Dauphiny. Villars</HI> was &s;ent again&s;t him, to defend that Frontier; tho' he did all he could to decline that Command: He drew all his Forces together to cover <HI>Dau|phiny;</HI> and by the&s;e Motions, the Pa&s;&s;age into the <HI>Alps</HI> was now open: &s;o the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> &s;ecured that, and then marched back to be&s;iege fir&s;t <HI>Exilles,</HI> and then <HI>Fene&s;trella,</HI> two Places &s;trong by their Situation, from whence Excur&s;ions could have been made into <HI>Piedmont;</HI> &s;o that in ca&s;e of any Misfortune, in that Duke's Affairs, they would have been very unea&s;y Neighbours to him: he took them both. The greate&s;t Difficulty in tho&s;e Sieges, was from the Impracticablene&s;s of the Ground, which drew them out into &s;uch a length, that the Snow began to fall, by the time both were taken. By this means the <HI>Alps</HI> were cleared, and <HI>Dauphiny</HI> was now open to him: He was al&s;o Ma&s;ter of the Valley of <HI>Pra|gelas,</HI> and all things were ready, for a greater Progre&s;s in another Campaign.</P>
<P>The Emperor's Troops, that were commanded by him, were, at the end of the Sea&s;on, ordered to march into the Pope's Territo|ries; and were joined by &s;ome more Troops, drawn out of the <HI>Milaneze</HI> and the <HI>Mantuan.</HI> The Pope's Troops began the War, in a very barbarous manner; for while they were in a &s;ort of a Ce&s;&s;ation, they &s;urprized a Body of the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts,</HI> and without Mercy put them all to the Sword: But as the Imperial Army ad|vanced, the <HI>Papalins,</HI> or, as the <HI>Italians</HI> in deri&s;ion called them, the <HI>Papagallians,</HI> fled every where before them, even when they were three to one. As they came on, the Pope's Territories and Places were all ca&s;t open to them: <HI>Bologna,</HI> the mo&s;t important, and the riche&s;t of them all, capitulated; and received them with|out the lea&s;t Re&s;i&s;tance. The People of <HI>Rome</HI> were unea&s;y at the Pope's Proceedings, and at the Apprehen&s;ions of a new Sack from a <HI>German</HI> Army: They &s;hewed this &s;o openly, that Tumults there were much dreaded, and many Cardinals declared openly again&s;t this War. The Emperor &s;ent a Mini&s;ter to <HI>Rome,</HI> to &s;ee if Mat|ters could be accommodated: But the Terms propo&s;ed &s;eemed to be of hard Dige&s;tion, for the Pope was required to acknowledge King <HI>Charles,</HI> and in every particular to comply with the Empe|ror's Demands.</P>
<P><PB N="514" REF="540">
The Pope was amazed at his ill Succe&s;s, and at tho&s;e high Terms; but there was no Remedy left: The ill State of Affairs in <HI>France,</HI> was now &s;o vi&s;ible, that no regard was had to the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pope is obliged to &s;ubmit to the Em|peror.</NOTE> great Promi&s;es, which Mare&s;chal <HI>Te&s;&s;e</HI> was making, nor was there any hopes of drawing the Princes and States of <HI>Italy,</HI> into an Al|liance for his Defence. In conclu&s;ion, the Pope, after he had delayed yielding to the Emperor's Demands long enough, to give the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> time to eat up his Country, at la&s;t &s;ubmitted to every thing; yet he delayed acknowledging King <HI>Charles</HI> for &s;ome Months, tho' he then promi&s;ed to do it; upon which the Emperor drew his Troops out of his Territories. The Pope turned over the manner of acknowledging King <HI>Charles,</HI> to a Congre|gation <NOTE PLACE="marg">And ac|knowledged K. <HI>Charles</HI></NOTE> of Cardinals: But they had no mind to take the load of this upon them&s;elves, which would draw an Exclu&s;ion upon them from <HI>France,</HI> in every Conclave; they left it to the Pope, and he affected Delays: So that it was not done, till the end of the following Year.</P>
<P>The Affairs in <HI>Hungary</HI> continued in the &s;ame ill State, in <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in <HI>Hungary.</HI></NOTE> which they had been for &s;ome Years: The Emperor did not grant the Demands of the Diet, that he had called; nor did he redre&s;s their Grievances, and he had not a Force &s;trong enough to reduce the Malecontents: So that his Council could not fall on Methods, either to &s;atisfy, or to &s;ubdue them.</P>
<P><HI>Poland</HI> continued &s;till to be a Scene of War and Mi&s;ery; to their other Calamities, they had the Addition of a Plague, which <NOTE PLACE="marg">And in <HI>Poland.</HI></NOTE> laid &s;ome of their great Towns wa&s;te: The Party, formed again&s;t <HI>Stani&s;laus,</HI> continued &s;till to oppo&s;e him, tho' they had no King to head them: The King of <HI>Sweden</HI>'s warlike Humour po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him to &s;uch a degree, that he re&s;olved to march into <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI> The <HI>Czar</HI> tried, how far Submi&s;&s;ions and Interce&s;&s;ions could &s;often him; but he was inflexible: He marched thro the <HI>Ukrain,</HI> but made no great progre&s;s: The whole <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Force fell on one of his Generals, that had about him only a Part of his Army, and gave him a total Defeat, mo&s;t of his Hor&s;e being cut off. After that, we were, for many Months, without any certain News from tho&s;e Parts: Both &s;ides pretended, they had great Advantages; and as <HI>Stani&s;laus</HI>'s Intere&s;ts carried him to &s;et out and magnify the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Succe&s;s, &s;o the Party that oppo&s;ed him, &s;tudied as much to rai&s;e the Credit of the <HI>Mu&s;covites:</HI> So that it was not yet ea&s;y to know, what to believe further, than that there had been no deci&s;ive Action, throughout the whole Year; nor was there any during the following Winter.</P>
<P>Our Affairs at Sea were le&s;s unfortunate this Year, than they had been formerly: The Merchants were better &s;erved with <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs at Sea.</NOTE>

Convoys, and we made no con&s;iderable Lo&s;&s;es. A Squadron that was &s;ent to the Bay of <HI>Mexico,</HI> met with the Galleons, and en|gaged them: If all their Captains had done their Duty, they had been all taken: Some few fought well. The Admiral of the Galleons, which carried a great Trea&s;ure, was &s;unk; the Vice-Admiral was taken, and the Rear-Admiral run him&s;elf a&s;hore near <HI>Cartagena;</HI> the re&s;t got away. The Enemy lo&s;t a great deal by this Action, tho' we did not gain &s;o much as we might have done, if all our Captains had been brave and diligent. Another Squadron carried over the Queen of <HI>Portugal,</HI> which was performed with great Magnificence; &s;he had a quick and ea&s;y Pa&s;&s;age. This did in &s;ome mea&s;ure compen&s;ate to that Crown for our failing them, in not &s;ending over the Supplies that we had &s;tipulated; it was a particular Happine&s;s, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were &s;o weak, as not to be able to take advantage of the naked and unguarded State, in which the <HI>Portugueze</HI> were at this time.</P>
<P>In the end of <HI>October, George</HI> Prince of <HI>Denmark</HI> died, in the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince <HI>George</HI>'s Death:</NOTE> Fifty-&s;ixth Year of his Age, after he had been Twenty-five Years, and &s;ome Months, married to the Queen: He was A&s;thmatical, which grew on him with his Years; for &s;ome time he was con|&s;idered as a dying Man, but the la&s;t Year of his Life, he &s;eemed to be recovered, to a better State of Health. The Queen had been, during the whole cour&s;e of her Marriage, an extraordinary tender and affectionate Wife: And in all his Illne&s;s, which la&s;ted &s;ome Years, &s;he would never leave his Bed; but &s;ate up, &s;ome|times half the Night in the Bed by him, with &s;uch Care and Concern, that &s;he was looked on very de&s;ervedly, as a Pattern in this re&s;pect.</P>
<P>This Prince had &s;hewed him&s;elf brave in War, both in <HI>Den|mark</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">And Cha|racter.</NOTE> and in <HI>Ireland:</HI> His Temper was mild and gentle: He had made a good progre&s;s in Mathematicks: He had travelled thro' <HI>France, Italy,</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> and knew much more, than he could well expre&s;s; for he &s;poke acquired Languages ill and ungracefully. He was free from all Vice: He meddled little in Bu&s;ine&s;s, even after the Queen's Acce&s;&s;ion to the Crown: He was &s;o gained to the Tories, by the Act which they carried in his favour, that he was much in their Intere&s;t: He was unhappily prevailed with, to take on him the Po&s;t of High-Admiral, of which he under&s;tood little; but was &s;atally led by tho&s;e, who had Credit with him, who had not all of them his good Quali|ties, but had both an ill Temper and bad Principles: His being bred to the Sea, gained him &s;ome Credit in tho&s;e Matters. In the Conduct of our Affairs, as great Errors were committed, &s;o
<PB N="516" REF="542">
great Misfortunes had followed on them: All th$&s;e were imputed to the Prince's Ea&s;ine&s;s, and to his Favourite's ill Management and bad De&s;igns. This drew a very heavy load on the Prince, and made his Death to be the le&s;s lamented: The Queen was not only decently, but deeply affected with it.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> was now advanced to the Po&s;t of High-Admiral; <NOTE PLACE="marg">A new Mi|ni&s;try.</NOTE> which he entred on with great Unea&s;ine&s;s, and a ju&s;t Apprehen&s;ion, of the Difficulty of maintaining it well, in a time of War: He was at that time both Lord <HI>Pre&s;ident</HI> of the Council, and Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland.</HI> The Earl of <HI>Wharton</HI> had the Government of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Somers</HI> was made Lord Pre&s;ident of the Council: The great Capacity and inflexible Inte|grity of this Lord, would have made his Promotion to this Po&s;t very acceptable to the Whigs, at any Juncture, but it was mo&s;t par|ticularly &s;o at this time; for it was expected that Propo&s;itions for a general Peace would be quickly made; and &s;o they reckoned, that the Management of that, upon which, not only the Safety of the Nation, but of all <HI>Europe</HI> depended, was in &s;ure hands, when he was &s;et at the head of the Councils, upon whom, neither ill Prac|tices nor fal&s;e Colours were like to make any Impre&s;&s;ion. Thus the Minds of all tho&s;e, who were truly zealous for the pre&s;ent Con&s;titution, were much quieted by this Promotion; tho' their Jealou&s;ies had a deep root, and were not ea&s;ily removed.</P>
<P>The Parliament was opened in the middle of <HI>November,</HI> with <NOTE PLACE="marg">A new Par|liament opened.</NOTE> great advantage; for the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try was now wholly &s;uch, that it gave an entire content, to all who wi&s;hed well to our Af|fairs: And the great Succe&s;&s;es abroad, &s;ilenced tho&s;e who were otherwi&s;e di&s;po&s;ed to find fault, and to complain. The Queen did not think it decent for her to come to Parliament, during this whole Se&s;&s;ion: So it was managed by a Commi&s;&s;ion repre&s;enting her Per&s;on. Sir <HI>Richard On&s;low</HI> was cho&s;en Speaker, without the lea&s;t Oppo&s;ition: He was a worthy Man, entirely zealous for the Government; he was very acceptable to the Whigs, and the Tories felt that they had &s;o little &s;trength in this Parliament, that they re&s;olved to lie &s;ilent, and to wait for &s;uch Advantages, as the Cir|cum&s;tances of Affairs might give them. In the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, the Supplies that were demanded, were granted very una|nimou&s;ly, not only for maintaining the Force then on foot, but for an Augmentation of 10000 more: This was thought nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;s the War with more force, as the &s;ure&s;t way to bring on a &s;peedy Peace: The <HI>States</HI> agreed to the like Augmentation on their &s;ide. The <HI>French,</HI> according to their u&s;ual Vanity, gave out, that they had great De&s;igns in view for the next Campaign: And it was confidently &s;pread about by the <HI>Jacobites,</HI> that a new
<PB N="517" REF="543">
Inva&s;ion was de&s;igned, both on <HI>Scotland,</HI> and on <HI>Ireland.</HI> At the end of the Campaign, Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> went to the Court of <HI>Vienna,</HI> which obliged the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> to &s;tay on the other &s;ide, till he returned. Things went on in both Hou&s;es, ac|cording to the directions given at Court, for the Court being now joined with the Whigs, they had a clear Majority in every thing: All Elections were judged in favour of Whigs and Courtiers, but with &s;o much Partiality, that tho&s;e, who had formerly made loud Complaints of the Inju&s;tice of the Tories, in determining Elections, when they were a Majority, were not &s;o much as out of counte|nance, when they were reproached for the &s;ame thing: They pre|tended, they were in a State of War with the Tories, &s;o that it was rea&s;onable to retaliate this to them, on the account of their former Proceedings: But this did not &s;atisfy ju&s;t and upright Men, who would not do to others, that which they had com|plained of, when it was done to them, or to their Friends. The Hou&s;e of Commons voted a Supply of &s;even Millions, for the Ser|vice of the en&s;uing Year; the Land-Tax, and the Duty on Malt, were readily agreed to: But it took &s;ome time to find a Fund for the re&s;t, that they had voted.</P>
<P>A Petition, of a new nature, was brought before the Lords, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1709. Debates concerning the Elections of the Peers of <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> with relation to the Election of the Peers from <HI>Scotland:</HI> There was a Return made in due form, but a Petition was laid before the Hou&s;e in the name of four Lords, who pretended that they ought to have been returned: The Duke of <HI>Queensbury</HI> had been created a Duke of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> by the Title of Duke of <HI>Dover,</HI> yet he thought he had &s;till a right to vote as a Peer of <HI>Scotland:</HI> He had likewi&s;e a Proxy, &s;o that two Votes depended on this point, whether the <HI>Scotch</HI> Peerage did &s;ink into the Peerage of <HI>Great Bri|tain.</HI> Some Lords, who were Pri&s;oners in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> on &s;u&s;picion, as favouring the Pretender, had &s;ent for the Sheriff of <HI>Lothian</HI> to the Ca&s;tle, and had taken the Oaths before him; and upon that, were reckoned to be qualified to vote or make a Proxy; now it was pretended, that the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> was a Con&s;tabulatory, and was out of the Sheriff's Juri&s;diction; and that therefore, he could not legally tender them the Oaths: Some Proxies were &s;igned, without &s;ub&s;cribing Witne&s;&s;es, a Form ne|ce&s;&s;ary by their Law: Other Exceptions were al&s;o taken, from &s;ome Rules of the Law of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which had not been ob&s;erved. The Clerks being al&s;o complained of, they were &s;ent for, and were or|dered to bring up with them all In&s;truments or Documents relating to the Election: When they came up, and every thing was laid before the Hou&s;e of Lords, the whole Matter was long and well debated.</P>
<P><PB N="518" REF="544">
As to the Duke of <HI>Queensbury</HI>'s voting among the <HI>Scotch</HI> Lords, it was &s;aid, that if a Peer of <HI>Scotland,</HI> being made a Peer of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> did &s;till retain his Intere&s;t in electing the Six|teen <NOTE PLACE="marg">A <HI>Scotch</HI> Peer created a Peer of <HI>Great Bri|tain</HI> was to have no Vote there.</NOTE> from <HI>Scotland,</HI> this would create a great Inequality among Peers; &s;ome having a Vote by Repre&s;entation, as well as in Per|&s;on: The Precedent was mi&s;chievous, &s;ince by the creating &s;ome of the chief Families in <HI>Scotland,</HI> Peers of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> they would be able to carry the whole Election of the Sixteen, as they plea&s;ed. It was objected, that by a Clau&s;e in the Act pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince the Union, the Peers of <HI>England</HI> (who were likewi&s;e Peers of <HI>Scot|land)</HI> had a right to vote, in the Election of <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;till re|&s;erved to them, &s;o there &s;eemed to be a Parity in this Ca&s;e with that: But it was an&s;wered, that a Peer of <HI>England</HI> and a Peer of <HI>Scotland</HI> held their Dignity under two different Crowns, and by two different Great Seals: But <HI>Great Britain,</HI> including <HI>Scotland</HI> as well as <HI>England,</HI> the <HI>Scotch</HI> Peerage mu&s;t now merge in that of <HI>Great Britain:</HI> Be&s;ides, that there were but five, who were Peers of both Kingdoms, before the Union; &s;o that, as it might be rea&s;onable to make Provi&s;ion for them, &s;o was it of no great con|&s;equence, but if this Precedent were allowed, it might go much further: and have very ill Con&s;equences. Upon a Divi&s;ion of the Hou&s;e, the Matter was determined again&s;t the Duke of <HI>Queens|bury.</HI></P>
<P>A great deal was &s;aid both at the Bar by Lawyers, and in the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Other Ex|ceptions were deter|mined.</NOTE> Debate in the Hou&s;e, upon the point of Juri&s;diction, and of the Exemption of a Con&s;tabulatory: It was &s;aid, that the Sheriffs Court ought to be, as all Courts were, open and free; and &s;o could not be held within a Ca&s;tle or Pri&s;on: But no expre&s;s De|ci&s;ion had ever been made in this Matter. The Pri&s;oners had taken the Oaths, which was the chief Intent of the Law, in the be&s;t manner they could; &s;o that it &s;eemed not rea&s;onable to cut them off from the main Privilege of Peerage, that was re&s;erved to them, becau&s;e they could not go abroad to the Sheriffs Court: After a long Debate, it was carried, that the Oaths were duly ten|dred to them. Some other Exceptions were proved and admitted, the Returns of &s;ome, certifying that they had taken the Oaths, were not &s;ealed, and &s;ome had &s;igned the&s;e, without &s;ub&s;cribing Witne&s;&s;es: other Exceptions were offered from Provi&s;ions, the Law of <HI>Scotland</HI> had made, with relation to Bonds and other Deeds, which had not been ob&s;erved in making of Proxies: But the Hou&s;e of Lords did not think the&s;e were of that Importance, as to vacate the Proxies on that account. So, after a full Hearing, and a Debate that la&s;ted many Days, there was but one of the Peers, that was re|turned, who was found not duly elected, and only one of the

petitioning Lords was brought into the Hou&s;e; the Marque&s;s of <HI>An|nandale</HI> was received, and the Marque&s;s of <HI>Lothian</HI> was &s;et a&s;ide.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scotch</HI> Members in both Hou&s;es were divided into Fac|tions: <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Faction among the <HI>Scots.</HI></NOTE> The Duke of <HI>Queensbury</HI> had his Party, &s;till depending on him: He was in &s;uch credit with the Lord Trea&s;urer and the Queen, that all the Po&s;ts in <HI>Scotland</HI> were given to Per&s;ons re|commended by him: The chief Mini&s;ters at Court &s;eemed to have laid it down for a Maxim, not to be departed from, to look carefully to Elections in <HI>Scotland;</HI> that the Members returned from thence, might be in an entire Dependance on them, and be either Whigs or Tories, as they &s;hould &s;hift &s;ides. The Duke of <HI>Queensbury</HI> was made third Secretary of State; he had no foreign Province a&s;&s;igned him, but <HI>Scotland</HI> was left to his Management: The Dukes of <HI>Hamilton, Montro&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Roxburgh,</HI> had &s;et them|&s;elves in an oppo&s;ition to his Power, and had carried many Elec|tions again&s;t him: The Lord <HI>Somers</HI> and <HI>Sunderland</HI> &s;upported them, but could not prevail with the Lord Trea&s;urer, to bring them into an equal &s;hare of the Admini&s;tration; this had almo&s;t occa&s;ioned a Breach; for the Whigs, tho' they went on in a con|junction with the Lord Trea&s;urer, yet continued &s;till to be jealous of him.</P>

adhered to the <HI>Scotch</HI> Mini&s;ters, and &s;upported them, by which, the advantage that might have been made from the&s;e &s;evere Pro|ceedings was lo&s;t; but the chief occa&s;ion given, to the Act con|cerning Trea&s;ons in <HI>Scotland,</HI> was from a Trial of &s;ome Gentle|men of that Kingdom, who had left their Hou&s;es, when the Pre|tender was on the Sea, and had gone about armed, and in &s;o &s;ecret and &s;u&s;picious a manner, that it gave great cau&s;e of Jea|lou&s;y: There was no clear Evidence to convict them, but there were very &s;trong, if not violent Pre&s;umptions again&s;t them: Some Forms in the Trial had not been ob&s;erved, which the cri|minal Court judged were nece&s;&s;ary, and not to be di&s;pen&s;ed with. But the Queen's Advocate Sir <HI>James Stuart</HI> was of another mind: The Court thought it was nece&s;&s;ary by their Laws, that the Names of the Witne&s;&s;es &s;hould have been &s;ignified to the Pri&s;oners fifteen Days before their Trial: But the Queen's Advocate had not com|plied with this, as to the chief Witne&s;&s;es; &s;o the Court could not hear their Evidence: He did not upon that move for a Delay, &s;o the Trial went on, and the Gentlemen were acquitted. Severe Expo&s;tulations pa&s;&s;ed between the Queen's Advocate and the Court: They complained of one another to the Queen, and both &s;ides ju&s;tified their Complaints in print. Upon this it appeared, that the Laws in <HI>Scotland,</HI> concerning Trials in Ca&s;es of Trea&s;on, were not fixed nor certain: So a Bill was brought into the Hou&s;e of Commons, to &s;ettle that matter; but it was &s;o much oppo&s;ed by the <HI>Scotch</HI> Members, that it was dropt in the Committee: It was taken up and managed with more Zeal by the Lords.</P>
<P>It con&s;i&s;ted of three Heads: All Crimes, which were High-Trea&s;on <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Head$ of the Act.</NOTE> by the Law of <HI>England</HI> (and the&s;e only) were to be High-Trea&s;on in <HI>Scotland:</HI> The Manner of proceeding &s;ettled in <HI>England</HI> was to be ob&s;erved in <HI>Scotland;</HI> and the Pains and For|feitures were to be the &s;ame in both Nations. The <HI>Scotch</HI> Lords oppo&s;ed every Branch of this Act: They moved, that all things that were High-Trea&s;on by the Law of <HI>England,</HI> might be enumerated in the Act, for the Information of the <HI>Scotch</HI> Nation: Otherwi&s;e they mu&s;t &s;tudy the Book of Statutes, to know when they were &s;afe, and when they were guilty. To this it was an&s;wered, that Di|rection would be given to the Judges, to publi&s;h an Ab&s;tract of the Laws of High-Trea&s;on, which would be a &s;ufficient Infor|mation to the People of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in this matter: That Nation would by this means be in a much &s;a&s;er condition, than they were now; for the Laws they had, were conceived in &s;uch ge|neral Words, that the Judges might put &s;uch Con&s;tructions on them, as &s;hould &s;erve the ends of a bad Court; but they would by this Act be re&s;trained in this matter for the $uture.</P>
<P><PB N="521" REF="547">
The Second Head in this Bill occa&s;ioned a much longer De|bate: It changed the whole Method of Proceedings in <HI>Scotland:</HI> The former way there was, the Queen's Advocate &s;igned a Ci|tation <NOTE PLACE="marg">The $orms of proceed|ing in <HI>Scot|land.</HI></NOTE> of the Per&s;ons, &s;etting forth the &s;pecial Matter of High-Trea&s;on, of which they were accu&s;ed; this was to be delivered to them, together with the Names of the Witne&s;&s;es, fifteen Days before the Trial. When the Jury was empannelled, no pe|remptory Challenges were allowed; Rea&s;ons were to be offered with every Challenge, and if the Court admitted them, they were to be proved immediately. Then the Matter of the Charge, which is there called the Relevancy of the Libel, was to be argued by Lawyers, whether the Matter, &s;uppo&s;e it &s;hould be proved, did amount to High-Trea&s;on or not; this was to be determined by a Sentence of the Court, called the <HI>Interloquitur:</HI> And the Proof of the Fact was not till then to be made: Of that the Jury had the Cognizance. Antiently the Verdict went with the Majority, the number being fifteen; but by a late Act, the Verdict was to be given, upon the Agreement of two third Parts of the Jury: In the Sentence, the Law did not limit the Judges to a certain Form, but they could aggravate the Puni&s;hment, or moderate it, ac|cording to the Circum&s;tances of the Ca&s;e. All this method was to be &s;et a&s;ide: A Grand Jury was to find the Bill, the Judges were only to regulate Proceedings, and to declare what the Law was, and the whole Matter of the Indictment was to be left en|tirely to the Jury, who were to be twelve, and all to agree in their Verdict.</P>
<P>In one particular, the Forms in <HI>Scotland</HI> were much preferable to tho&s;e in <HI>England;</HI> the Depo&s;itions of the Witne&s;&s;es were taken indeed by Word of Mouth, but were writ out, and after that were &s;igned by the Witne&s;&s;es; they were &s;ent in to the Jury; and the&s;e were made a part of the Record. This was very &s;low and tedious, but the Jury, by this means, was more certainly po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Evidence; and the Matter was more clearly delivered down to Po&s;terity: whereas the Records in <HI>England</HI> are very de|fective, and give no light to a Hi&s;torian, that peru&s;es them, as I found when I wrote the <HI>Hi&s;tory of the Reformation.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Scotch</HI> oppo&s;ed this Alteration of their way of Proceeding; they &s;aid, that neither the Judges, the Advocates, nor the Clerks would know how to manage a Trial of Trea&s;on: They in&s;i&s;ted mo&s;t on the having the Names of the Witne&s;&s;es, to be given to the Per&s;ons, &s;ome Days before their Trial: It &s;eemed rea&s;onable, that a Man &s;hould know who was to be brought to witne&s;s again&s;t him, that &s;o he might examine his Life, and &s;ee what credit ought to be given to him: On the other hand it was &s;aid, this
<PB N="522" REF="548">
would open a door to much Practice, either upon the Witne&s;&s;es to corrupt them, or in &s;uborning other Witne&s;&s;es, to defame them. To this it was an&s;wered, that a guilty Man knew what could be brought again&s;t him, and without &s;uch notice would take all the Methods po&s;&s;ible to defend him&s;elf: But Provi&s;ion ought to be made for innocent Men, who&s;e chief guilt might be a good E&s;tate, upon which a Favourite might have an eye: And therefore &s;uch Per&s;ons ought to be taken care of. This was after|wards &s;o much &s;oftened, that it was only de&s;ired, that the Names of the Witne&s;&s;es, that had given evidence to the Grand Jury &s;hould, upon their finding the Bill, be &s;ignified to the Pri&s;oner, five Days before his Trial. Upon a Divi&s;ion of the Hou&s;e on this Que&s;tion, the Votes were equal; &s;o by the Rule of the Hou&s;e, that in &s;uch a ca&s;e the Negative prevails, it was lo&s;t. Upon the third Head of the Bill, the Debates grew &s;till warmer: In <HI>Scot|land</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the For|feitures in Ca&s;es of Trea&s;on.</NOTE> many Families were &s;ettled by long Entails and Perpetuities; &s;o it was &s;aid, that &s;ince, by one of the Articles of the Union, all private Rights were &s;till pre&s;erved, no Breach could be made on the&s;e Settlements. I carried this farther: I thought it was neither ju&s;t nor rea&s;onable to &s;et the Children on begging, for their Fa|ther's Faults: The <HI>Romans,</HI> during their Liberty, never thought of carrying Puni&s;hments &s;o far: It was an Invention, under the Tyranny of the Emperors, who had a particular Revenue called the <HI>Fi&s;c,</HI> and all Forfeitures were claimed by them, from whence they were called Confi&s;cations: It was never the Practice of free Go|vernments: <HI>Bologna</HI> flouri&s;hed beyond any Town in the Pope's Dominions, becau&s;e they made it an Article of their Capitulation with the Pope, that no Confi&s;cation &s;hould follow on any Crime what&s;oever. In <HI>Holland</HI> the Confi&s;cation was redeemable by &s;o very &s;mall a Sum, as an Hundred Guilders: Many In&s;tances could be brought of Pro&s;ecutions, only to obtain the Confi&s;cation: But none of the Lords &s;econded me in this; it was acknowledged, that this was ju&s;t and rea&s;onable, and fit to be pa&s;&s;ed in good times, but &s;ince we were now expo&s;ed to &s;o much Danger from abroad, it did not &s;eem advi&s;eable to abate the Severity of the Law: But Clau&s;es were agreed to, by which, upon Marriages, Settlements might be made in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as was practi&s;ed in <HI>England;</HI> for no E&s;tate is forfeited for the Crime of him, who is only Tenant for Life. By this Act al&s;o, Tortures were con|demned, and the Queen was empowered to grant Commi&s;&s;ions of <HI>Oyer</HI> and <HI>Terminer</HI> as in <HI>England,</HI> for trying Trea&s;ons: The <HI>Scotch</HI> in&s;i&s;ted on this, that the Ju&s;ticiary or the Criminal Court being pre&s;erved by an Article of the Union, this broke in upon that. It was an&s;wered, the Criminal Court was &s;till to &s;it, in the
<PB N="523" REF="549">
Times regulated: But the&s;e Commi&s;&s;ions were granted upon &s;pe|cial Occa&s;ions. In the Intervals, between the Terms, it might be nece&s;&s;ary upon &s;ome Emergency not to delay Trials too long: But to give &s;ome content, it was providedby a Clau&s;e, that a Judge of the Criminal Court &s;hould be always one of the <HI>Quorum,</HI> in the&s;e Commi&s;&s;ions: So the Bill pa&s;&s;ed in the Hou&s;e of Lords, notwith&s;tanding the Oppo&s;ition of all the <HI>Scotch</HI> Lords, with whom many of the Tories concurred; they being di&s;po&s;ed to op|po&s;e the Court in every thing, and to make Trea&s;on as little to be dreaded as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The Bill met with the &s;ame Oppo&s;ition in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Amend|ments to the Act.</NOTE> yet it pa&s;&s;ed with two Amendments: By one, the Names of the Witne&s;&s;es, that had appeared before the Grand Jury, were ordered to be &s;ent to the Pri&s;oner, ten Days before his Trial: The other was, that no E&s;tate in Land was to be forfeited, upon a Judgment of High-Trea&s;on: This came up fully to the Motion I had made. Both the&s;e Amendments were looked on as &s;uch popular things, that it was not probable, that the Hou&s;e of Com|mons would recede from them: Upon that, the Whigs in the Hou&s;e of Lords did not think fit to oppo&s;e them, or to lo&s;e the Bill: So it was moved to agree to the&s;e Amendments, with this Provi&s;o, that they &s;hould not take place till after the Death of the <HI>Pretender:</HI> It was &s;aid, that &s;ince he a&s;&s;umed the Title of King of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and had &s;o lately attempted to invade us, it was not rea&s;onable to le&s;&s;en the Puni&s;hment, and the Dread of Trea&s;on, as long as he lived. Others objected to this, that there would be &s;till a Pretender after him, &s;ince &s;o many Per&s;ons &s;tood in the Li|neal De&s;cent before the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover;</HI> &s;o that this Provi&s;o &s;eemed to be, upon the Matter, the rejecting the Amendment: but it was ob&s;erved, that to pretend to the Right of &s;ucceeding, was a different thing from a&s;&s;uming the Title, and attempting an Inva|&s;ion. The Amendment was received by the Hou&s;e of Lords with this Provi&s;o; tho&s;e who were again&s;t the whole Bill, did not agree to it. The Hou&s;e of Commons con&s;ented to the Pro|vi&s;o, which the Lords had added to their Amendment, with a further Addition, that it &s;hould not take place till three Years after the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover</HI> &s;hould &s;ucceed to the Crown.</P>
<P>This met with great Oppo&s;ition, it was con&s;idered as a di&s;tin|gui&s;hing <NOTE PLACE="marg">It pa&s;&s;ed in both Hou&s;es.</NOTE> Character of tho&s;e, who were for or again&s;t the pre&s;ent Con&s;titution, and the Succe&s;&s;ion; the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;till oppo&s;ing it on the account of their formal Laws: Both Parties mu&s;tered up their Strength, and many, who had gone into the Country, were brought up on this occa&s;ion: So that the Bill, with all the Amendments and Provi&s;o's, was carried by a &s;mall Majority;
<PB N="524" REF="550">
the Lords agreeing to this new Amendment. The <HI>Scotch</HI> Mem|bers in both Hou&s;es &s;eemed to apprehend, that the Bill would be very odious in their Country; &s;o to maintain their Intere&s;t at home, they, who were divided in every thing el&s;e, did agree in oppo&s;ing this Bill.</P>
<P>The Court apprehended from the Heat, with which the De|bates <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Act of Grace.</NOTE> were managed, and the Difficulty in carrying the Bill thro' both Hou&s;es, that ill-di&s;po&s;ed Men would endeavour to po&s;&s;e&s;s People, with Apprehen&s;ions of bad De&s;igns and Severities, that would be &s;et on foot; &s;o they re&s;olved to have an Act of Grace immediately upon it: It was the fir&s;t the Queen had &s;ent, tho' &s;he had then reigned above &s;even Years: The Mini&s;ters, for their own &s;ake, took care that it &s;hould be very full; it was indeed fuller than any former Act of Grace, all Trea&s;ons committed before the &s;igning the Act, which was the 19th of <HI>April,</HI> were pardoned, tho&s;e only excepted that were done upon the Sea: By this, tho&s;e who had imbarked with the Pretenderwere &s;till at mercy. This Act, according to form, was read once in both Hou&s;es, and with the u&s;ual Complements of Thanks, and with that the Se&s;&s;ion ended.</P>
<P>Other things of great Importance pa&s;&s;ed during this Se&s;&s;ion: <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Enlarge|ment of the Bank.</NOTE> The Hou&s;e of Commons voted an Enlargement of the <HI>Bank,</HI> al|mo&s;t to three Millions, upon which, the Books were opened to receive new Sub&s;criptions: and to the Admiration of all <HI>Europe,</HI> as well as of our &s;elves at home, the whole Sum was &s;ub&s;cribed in a few Hours time: This &s;hewed both the Wealth of the Nation, and the Confidence that all People had in the Government. By this Sub|&s;cription, and by a further Prolongation of the General Mortgage of the Revenue, they created good Funds, for an&s;wering all the Money, that they had voted in the beginning of the Se&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Our Trade was now very high; and was carried on every where <NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Riche$ in <HI>Portugal.</HI></NOTE> with advantage, but no where more than at <HI>Lisbon:</HI> For the <HI>Por|tugueze</HI> were &s;o happy, in their Dominions in <HI>America,</HI> that they di&s;covered va&s;t Quantities of Gold in their Mines, and we were a&s;&s;ured that they had brought home to <HI>Portugal,</HI> the former Year, about four Millions <HI>Sterling,</HI> of which they, at that time, &s;tood in great need, for they had a very bad Harve&s;t: But Gold an|&s;wers all things: They were &s;upplied from <HI>England</HI> with Corn, and we had in return a large &s;hare of their Gold.</P>
<P>An Act pa&s;&s;ed in this Se&s;&s;ion, that was much de&s;ired, and had <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Act for a General Na|turalization of all Pro|te&s;tants.</NOTE> been often attempted, but had been laid a&s;ide in &s;o many former Parliaments, that there was &s;carce any hopes left to encourage a new Attempt: It was for Naturalizing all foreign Prote&s;tants, upon their taking the Oaths to the Government, and their receiving the Sacrament in any Prote&s;tant Church. Tho&s;e who were again&s;t
<PB N="525" REF="551">
the Act, &s;oon perceived that they could have no Strength, if they &s;hould &s;et them&s;elves directly to oppo&s;e it; &s;o they &s;tudied to limit Strangers in the receiving the Sacrament, to the way of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> This probably would not have hindred many, who were otherwi&s;e di&s;po&s;ed to come among us: For the much greater part of the <HI>French</HI> came into the way of our Church. But it was thought be&s;t to ca&s;t the Door as wide open as po&s;&s;ible, for en|couraging of Strangers: And therefore &s;ince, upon their fir&s;t coming over, &s;ome might chu&s;e the Way, to which they had been accu&s;tomed beyond Sea, it &s;eemed the more inviting method to admit of all who were in any Prote&s;tant Communion: This was carried in the Hou&s;e of Commons, with a great Majority; but all tho&s;e, who appeared for this large and comprehen&s;ive way, were reproached for their Coldne&s;s and Indifference in the Concerns of the Church: And in that I had a large &s;hare; as I &s;poke copiou&s;ly for it, when it was brought up to the Lords: the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> &s;poke as zealou&s;ly again&s;t it, for he &s;eemed re&s;olved to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf, as a Zealot for that which was called High-Church. The Bill pa&s;&s;ed with very little Oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>There was all this Winter great talk of Peace; which the Mi&s;e|ries <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Addre&s;s to the Queen $word$ $word$ of Peace &s;hould be opened.</NOTE> and Nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>France</HI> &s;eemed to drive them to: This gave occa&s;ion to a Motion, concerted among the Whigs, and opened by the Lord <HI>Halifax,</HI> that an Addre&s;s &s;hould be made to the Queen, to conclude no Peace with <HI>France,</HI> till they &s;hould di&s;|own the Pretender, and &s;end him out of that Kingdom, and till the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion &s;hould be univer&s;ally owned, and that a Guaranty &s;hould be &s;ettled among the Allies for &s;ecuring it. None dur&s;t venture to oppo&s;e this, &s;o it was ea&s;ily agreed to, and &s;ent down to the Hou&s;e of Commons, for their Concurrence. They pre&s;ently agreed to it, but added to it, a Matter of great impor|tance, that the demoli&s;hing of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> &s;hould be likewi&s;e in&s;i&s;ted on, before any Peace were concluded: So both Hou&s;es carried this Addre&s;s to the Queen, who received and an&s;wered it very favoura|bly. This was highly acceptable to the whole Nation, and to all our Allies. The&s;e were the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Tran&s;actions of this Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, which was concluded on the 21&s;t of <HI>April.</HI></P>
<P>The Convocation was &s;ummoned, cho&s;en, and returned as the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Convo|cation $word$ $word$ by a $span$.</NOTE> Parliament was: But it was too evident, that the &s;ame ill Tem|per, that had appeared in former Convocations, did &s;till prevail, tho' not with &s;uch a Majority: When the day came, in which it was to be opened, a Writ was &s;ent from the Queen to the Arch|bi&s;hop, ordering him to prorogue the Convocation for &s;ome Months: and at the end of the&s;e, there came another Writ, ordering a fur|ther
<PB N="526" REF="552">
Prorogation: So the Convocation was not opened during this Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament; by this, a pre&s;ent Stop was put to the factious Temper of tho&s;e, who &s;tudied to recommend them&s;elves by embroiling the Church.</P>
<P>It did not cure them; for they continued &s;till by Libels and <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Faction among the Clergy of <HI>Ireland.</HI></NOTE> fal&s;e Stories to animate their Party: and &s;o catching a thing is this turbulent Spirit, when once it prevails among Clergymen, that the &s;ame ill Temper began to &s;erment and &s;pread it &s;elf among the Clergy of <HI>Ireland;</HI> none of tho&s;e Di&s;putes had ever been thought of in that Church formerly, as they had no Records nor Minutes of former Convocations. The Faction here in <HI>England</HI> found out proper In&s;truments, to &s;et the &s;ame Humour on foot, during the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI>'s Government, and, as was &s;aid, by his Di|rections: And it being once &s;et a going, it went on by rea&s;on of the Indolence of the &s;ucceeding Governours: So the Clergy were making the &s;ame bold Claim there, that had rai&s;ed &s;uch Di&s;putes among us; and upon that, the Party here publi&s;hed tho&s;e Pre|ten&s;ions of theirs, with their u&s;ual Confidence, as founded on a clear Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and Pre&s;cription: And drew an Argument from that, to ju&s;tify and &s;upport their own Preten&s;ions, tho' tho&s;e in <HI>Ireland</HI> never dreamed of them, till they had the Pattern and Encouragement from hence. This was received by the Party with great Triumph, into &s;uch indirect Practices do Mens ill De&s;igns and Animo&s;ities engage them: But tho' this whole <NOTE PLACE="marg">A$span$ Tem|per among $line$ $word$ up.</NOTE> Matter was well detected and made appear, to their &s;hame, who had built &s;o much upon it, yet Parties are never out of counte|nance; but when one Artifice fails, they will lay out for ano|ther. The &s;ecret Encouragement, with which they did mo&s;t ef|fectually animate their Party, was, that the Queen's Heart was with them: And that tho' the War, and the other Circum&s;tances of her Affairs, obliged her at pre&s;ent to favour the moderate Party, yet as &s;oon as a Peace brought on a better Settlement, they pro|mi&s;ed them&s;elves all Favour at her hands. It was not certain, that they had then any ground for this, or that &s;he her&s;elf, or any by her order, gave them the&s;e Hopes; but this is certain, that many things might have been done to extingui&s;h tho&s;e Hopes, which were not done: &s;o that they &s;eemed to be left to plea&s;e them&s;elves with tho&s;e Expectations, which kept &s;till Life in their Party; and indeed it was but too vi&s;ible, that the much greater part of the Clergy, were in a very ill Temper, and under very bad Influences; Enemies to the Toleration, and &s;oured again&s;t the Di&s;&s;enters.</P>
<P>I now mu&s;t relate the Negotiations, that the <HI>French</HI> &s;et on foot <NOTE PLACE="marg">$span$ for Peace</NOTE> for a Peace. Soon after the Battle of <HI>Ramellies,</HI> the Elector of
<PB N="527" REF="553">
<HI>Bavaria</HI> gave out Hopes of a Peace; and that the King of <HI>France</HI> would come to a Treaty of Partition; that <HI>Spain</HI> and the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> &s;hould go to King <HI>Charles,</HI> if the Dominions of <HI>Italy</HI> were given to K. <HI>Philip.</HI> They hoped that <HI>England</HI> and the <HI>States</HI> would agree to this, as le&s;s concerned in <HI>Italy:</HI> But they knew, the Court of <HI>Vienna</HI> would never hearken to it; for they valued the Domi|nions in <HI>Italy,</HI> with the I&s;lands near them, much more than all the re&s;t of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy. But at the &s;ame time, that <HI>Lewis</HI> the XIVth was tempting us, with the Hopes of <HI>Spain</HI> and the <HI>We&s;t-Indies;</HI> by a Letter to the Pope, that King offered the Dominions in <HI>Italy</HI> to King <HI>Charles.</HI> The Parliament had al|ways declared, the ground of the War to be, the re&s;toring the whole <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> (which indeed the <HI>States</HI> had never done) &s;o the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> could not hearken to this: He convinced the <HI>States</HI> of the treacherous De&s;igns of the Court of <HI>France,</HI> in this Offer, and it was not en|tertained.</P>
<P>The Court of <HI>Vienna</HI> was &s;o alarmed at the Inclinations, &s;ome had expre&s;&s;ed towards the entertaining this Project, that this was believed to be the &s;ecret Motive of the Treaty, the &s;ucceeding Winter, for evacuating the <HI>Milane&s;e,</HI> and of their per&s;i&s;ting &s;o ob&s;tinately, the Summer after, in their De&s;igns upon <HI>Naples;</HI> for by this means they became Ma&s;ters of both. The <HI>French,</HI> being now reduced to great Extremities, by their con&s;tant ill Suc|ce&s;s, and by the Mi&s;eries of their People, re&s;olved to try the <HI>States</HI> again; and when the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> came over to <HI>England,</HI> Mr. <HI>Rouill&eacute;</HI> was &s;ent to <HI>Holland,</HI> with general Offers of Peace, de&s;iring them to propo&s;e what it was they in&s;i&s;ted on: And he offered them, as good a Barrier for them&s;elves as they could ask. The <HI>States,</HI> contrary to their Expectation, re&s;olved to adhere firmly to their Con&s;ederates, and to enter into no &s;epa|rate Treaty, but in conjunction with their Allies: &s;o, upon the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI>'s Return, they, with their Allies, began to prepare Preliminaries, to be fir&s;t agreed to, before a general Treaty &s;hould be opened: They had been &s;o well acquainted with the perfidious Methods of the <HI>French</HI> Court, when a Treaty was once opened, to divide the Allies, and to create Jealou&s;ies among them, and had felt &s;o &s;en&s;ibly the ill Effects of this, both at <HI>Nimeguen</HI> and <HI>Ry&s;wick,</HI> that they re&s;olved to u&s;e all nece&s;&s;ary Precautions for the future; &s;o Preliminaries were prepared, and the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> came over hither, to concert them with the Mini&s;try at home.</P>
<P>In this &s;econd Ab&s;ence of his, Mr. <HI>de Torcy,</HI> the Secretary of State for foreign Affairs, was &s;ent to the <HI>Hague,</HI> the better to di&s;po&s;e
<PB N="528" REF="554">
the <HI>States</HI> to Peace, by the Influence of &s;o great a Mini&s;ter; no Methods were left untried, both with the <HI>States</HI> in general, and with every Man they &s;poke with in particular, to beget in them a full A&s;&s;urance of the King's &s;incere Intentions for Peace: But they knew the Artifices of that Court too well, to be &s;oon de|ceived; &s;o they made no Advances till the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> came back, who carried over the Lord Vi&s;count <HI>Town&s;hend,</HI> to be conjunct Plenipotentiary with him&s;elf, reckoning the Load too great to bear it wholly on him&s;elf. The Choice was well made; for as Lord <HI>Town&s;hend</HI> had great Parts, had improved the&s;e by Travelling, and was by much the mo&s;t &s;hining Per&s;on of all our young Nobility, and had, on many Occa&s;ions, di&s;tingui&s;hed him|&s;elf very eminently; &s;o he was a Man of great Integrity, and of good Principles in all re&s;pects, free from all Vice, and of an engaging Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>The Foundation of the whole Treaty was, the re&s;toring of the whole <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy to King <HI>Charles,</HI> within two Months: <NOTE PLACE="marg">The P$span$ agreed on.</NOTE> <HI>Torcy</HI> &s;aid, the Time was too &s;hort, and that perhaps it was not in the King of <HI>France</HI>'s power to bring that about; for the <HI>Spa|niards</HI> &s;eemed re&s;olved to &s;tick to King <HI>Philip.</HI> It was, upon this, in&s;i&s;ted on, that the King of <HI>France</HI> &s;hould be obliged to concur with the Allies, to force it by all proper Methods: But this was not farther explained, for the Allies were well a&s;&s;ured, that if it was &s;incerely intended by <HI>France,</HI> there would be no great diffi|culty in bringing it about. This therefore, being laid down as the Ba&s;is of the Treaty, the other Preliminaries related to the re|&s;toring all the Places in the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> except <HI>Cambray</HI> and <HI>St. Omer;</HI> the demoli&s;hing or re&s;toring of <HI>Dunkirk;</HI> the re&s;toring of <HI>Strasbourg, Bri&s;ack,</HI> and <HI>Huningen</HI> to the Empire; <HI>Neu|foundland</HI> to <HI>England;</HI> and <HI>Savor</HI> to that Duke, be&s;ides his con|tinuing po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all, he then had in his hands; the acknow|ledging the King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI>'s Royal Dignity; and the Electorate in the Hou&s;e of <HI>Brun&s;wick;</HI> the &s;ending the <HI>Pretender</HI> out of <HI>France,</HI> and the owning the Succe&s;&s;ion to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> as it was &s;ettled by Law. As all the great Intere&s;ts were provided for, by the&s;e Preliminaries; &s;o all other Matters were re&s;erved to be con&s;idered, when the Treaty of Peace &s;hould be opened: A Ce&s;&s;ation of all Ho&s;tilities was to begin, within two Months, and to continue till all was concluded by a compleat Treaty, and ratified: provided the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy was then intirely re&s;tored. The <HI>French</HI> Plenipotentiaries &s;eemed to be confounded at the&s;e Demands. <HI>Torcy</HI> excepted to the leaving <HI>Exilles</HI> and <HI>Fene&s;trella</HI> in the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI>'s hands; for he &s;aid, he had no In&s;tructions relating to them: But in conclu&s;ion, they &s;eemed to &s;ubmit to
<PB N="529" REF="555">
them, and <HI>Torcy</HI> at parting de&s;ired the Ratifications might be returned with all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te, and promi&s;ed that the King of <HI>France</HI>'s final An&s;wer &s;hould be &s;ent, by the fourth of <HI>June;</HI> but &s;poke of their Affairs as a Man in de&s;pair: He &s;aid, he did not know but he might find King <HI>Philip</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> before he got thi|ther, and &s;aid all that was po&s;&s;ible, to a&s;&s;ure them of the Since|rity of the King of <HI>France,</HI> and to divert them from the Thoughts of opening the Campaign; but at the &s;ame time King <HI>Philip</HI> was getting his Son, the Prince of <HI>A&s;turias,</HI> to be acknowledged, by all the Towns and Bodies of <HI>Spain,</HI> as the Heir of that Mo|narchy.</P>
<P>Upon this outward Appearance of agreeing to the Prelimina|ries, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of <HI>France</HI> re|fu&s;es to ra|tify them.</NOTE> all People looked upon the Peace to be as good as made; and Ratifications came from all the Courts of the Allies, but the King of <HI>France</HI> refu&s;ed to agree to them: He pretended &s;ome Exceptions to the Articles, relating to the Emperor, and the Duke of <HI>Savoy;</HI> but in&s;i&s;ted chiefly on that, of not beginning the Su&s;pen&s;ion of Arms, till the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy &s;hould be all re&s;tored; he &s;aid, that was not in his power to execute; he or|dered his Mini&s;ter afterwards to yield up all but this la&s;t; and by a third Per&s;on, one <HI>Pettecum,</HI> it was offered, to put &s;ome more Towns into the hands of the Allies, to be kept by them, till <HI>Spain</HI> was re&s;tored. It appeared by this, that the <HI>French</HI> had no other De&s;ign in all this Negotiation, but to try if they could beget an ill Under&s;tanding among the Allies, or, by the &s;eeming great Conce&s;&s;ions, for the Security of the <HI>States,</HI> provoke the People of <HI>Holland</HI> again&s;t their Magi&s;trates, if they &s;hould carry on the War, when they &s;eemed to be &s;afe; and they reckoned, if a Su&s;|pen&s;ion of Arms could be once obtained, upon any other Terms, than the re&s;toring of <HI>Spain,</HI> then <HI>France</HI> would get out of the War, and the Allies mu&s;t try, how they could conquer <HI>Spain. France</HI> had &s;o perfidiou&s;ly broke all their Treaties, during this King's Reign, that it was a Piece of inexcu&s;able Folly, to expect any other from them. In the Peace of the <HI>Pyrenees,</HI> where the Intere&s;t of <HI>France</HI> was not &s;o deeply engaged, to pre&s;erve <HI>Portugal</HI> from falling under the Yoke of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> as it was now to pre&s;erve <HI>Spain</HI> in the hands of a Grand&s;on; after the King had &s;worn to give no A&s;&s;i&s;tance to <HI>Portugal,</HI> yet, under the pretence of breaking &s;ome Bodies, he &s;uffered them to be en|tertained by the <HI>Portugueze</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, and &s;ent <HI>Schomberg</HI> to command that Army; pretending he could not hinder one, that was a <HI>German</HI> by Birth, to go and &s;erve where he plea&s;ed: Un|der the&s;e Pretences, he had broke his Faith, where the Con&s;ide|ration was not &s;o &s;trong, as in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e. Thus it was
<PB N="530" REF="556">
vi&s;ible no Faith, that King could give, was to be relied on, and that unle&s;s <HI>Spain</HI> was re&s;tored, all would prove a fatal Delu&s;ion: Be&s;ides, it came afterwards to be known, that the Places in <HI>Bra|bant</HI> and <HI>Hainault,</HI> commanded by the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> would not have been evacuated by him, unle&s;s he had Orders for it from the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> under whom he governed in them; and that was not to be expected: So the Ea&s;ine&s;s, with which the <HI>French</HI> Mini&s;ters yielded to the Preliminaries, was now un|der&s;tood to be an Artifice, to &s;lacken the Zeal of the Confede|rates, in advancing the Campaign, as the lea&s;t Effect it would have: But in that, their Hopes failed them, for there was no time lo&s;t, in preparing to take the Field.</P>
<P>I do not mix, with the relation that I have given upon good Authority, the uncertain Reports we had of Di&s;tractions in the Court of <HI>France,</HI> where it was &s;aid, that the Duke of <HI>Bur|gundy</HI> pre&s;&s;ed the making a Peace, as nece&s;&s;ary to prevent Ruin of <HI>France,</HI> while the <HI>Dauphin</HI> pre&s;&s;ed more vehemently the continuance of the War, and the &s;upporting of the King of <HI>Spain:</HI> It was &s;aid, that Madam <HI>Maintenon</HI> appeared le&s;s at Court; <HI>Chamillard,</HI> who had mo&s;t of her Favour, was di&s;mi&s;s'd: but' it it is not certain, what Influence that had on the publick Coun|cils; and the Conduct of this whole Negotiation &s;hewed plainly, that there was nothing de&s;igned in it, but to divide, or to deceive the Confederates; and, if po&s;&s;ible, to gain a &s;eparate Peace for <HI>France;</HI> and then to let the Allies conquer <HI>Spain</HI> as they could. But the Allies kept firm to one another, and the Treachery of the <HI>French</HI> appeared &s;o vi&s;ible, even to the People in <HI>Holland,</HI> that all the Hopes they had, of inflaming them again&s;t their Ma|gi&s;trates, likewi&s;e failed. The People in <HI>France</HI> were much wrought on, by this pretended Indignity, offered to their Mo|narch, to oblige him to force his Grand&s;on to abandon <HI>Spain;</HI> and even, here in <HI>England,</HI> there wanted not many, who &s;aid it was a cruel Hard&s;hip put on the <HI>French</HI> King, to force him into &s;uch an unnatural War: But if he was guilty of the Inju&s;tice, of putting him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that Kingdom, it was but a rea&s;onable piece of Ju&s;tice, to undo what he him&s;elf had done: And it was &s;o vi&s;ible, that King <HI>Philip</HI> was maintained on that Throne, by the Councils and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>France,</HI> that no doubt was made, but that, if the King of <HI>France</HI> had really de&s;igned it, he could ea&s;ily have obliged him to relinqui&s;h all Proten&s;ions to that Crown.</P>
<P>Thus the Negotiations came &s;oon to an end; without pro|ducing <NOTE PLACE="marg">The War went on,</NOTE> any ill effect among the Allies; and all the Mini&s;ters at the <HI>Hague</HI> made great Acknowledgments to the Pen&s;ioner

<HI>Hein&s;ius,</HI> and to the <HI>States,</HI> for the Candor and Firmne&s;s they had expre&s;&s;ed on that occa&s;ion. The Mi&s;eries of <HI>France</HI> were repre|&s;ented, from all Parts, as extreme great; the Pro&s;pect both for Corn and Wine was &s;o low, that they &s;aw no Hope nor Relief. They &s;ent to all places for Corn, to pre&s;erve their People, many of the Ships that brought it to them, were taken by our Men of War; but this did not touch the Heart of their King, who &s;eemed to have hardened him&s;elf, again&s;t the Sen&s;e of the Mi&s;eries of his People. <HI>Villars</HI> was &s;ent to command the Armies in <HI>Flanders,</HI> of whom the King of <HI>France</HI> &s;aid, that he was never beaten; <HI>Har|court</HI> was &s;ent to command on the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Ber|wick</HI> in <HI>Dauphiny.</HI> This Summer pa&s;&s;ed over, without any con|&s;iderable Action in <HI>Spain:</HI> There was an Engagement on the Frontier of <HI>Portugal,</HI> in which the <HI>Portugueze</HI> behaved them|&s;elves <NOTE PLACE="marg">In <HI>Portugal,</HI></NOTE> very ill, and were beaten; but the <HI>Spaniards</HI> did not pur|&s;ue the Advantage they had by this Action: for they, apprehend|ing that our Fleet might have a De&s;ign upon &s;ome part of their Southern Coa&s;t, were forced to draw their Troops from the Fron|tiers of <HI>Portugal,</HI> to defend their own Coa&s;t; tho' we gave them no Di&s;turbance on that &s;ide.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>France,</HI> to carry on the &s;how of a De&s;ign for <NOTE PLACE="marg">In <HI>Spain,</HI></NOTE> Peace, withdrew his Troops out of <HI>Spain,</HI> but at the &s;ame time took care, to encourage the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Grandees, and to &s;upport his Grand&s;on: And &s;ince it was vi&s;ible, that either the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> or the Allies, were to be deceived by him, it was much more rea|&s;onable to believe that the Allies, and not the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> were to feel the Effects of this fraudulent way of proceeding. The <HI>French</HI> General <HI>Be&s;ons,</HI> who commanded in <HI>Arragon,</HI> had in|deed Orders not to venture on a Battle, for that would have been too gro&s;s a thing, to be in any wi&s;e palliated; but he continued all this Summer commanding their Armies.

near <HI>Ba&s;il,</HI> and on de&s;ign to break into <HI>Franche Comt&eacute;;</HI> but a de|tached Body of the <HI>French,</HI> lying in their way, there followed a very &s;harp Engagement; 2000 Men were reckoned to be killed on each &s;ide; but tho' the lo&s;s of Men was reckoned equal, yet the De&s;ign mi&s;carried, and the <HI>Germans</HI> were forced to repa&s;s the <HI>Rhine.</HI> The re&s;t of the Campaign went over there, without any Action.</P>
<P>The chief Scene was in <HI>Flanders;</HI> where the Duke of <HI>Marl|borough</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">And in <HI>Flan|ders.</HI></NOTE> tru&s;ting little to the Shews of Peace, had every thing in readine&s;s to open the Campaign, as &s;oon as he &s;aw what might be expected from the Court of <HI>France.</HI> The Army was formed near <HI>Li&s;le,</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> lay near <HI>Doway;</HI> the Train of Artillery was, by a Feint, brought up the <HI>Lys</HI> to <HI>Courtray;</HI> &s;o it was believed the De&s;ign was upon <HI>Ypres,</HI> and there being no Apprehen&s;ion of any Attempt on <HI>Tournay,</HI> no particular care was taken of it; but it was on the &s;udden inve&s;ted, and the Train was &s;ent back to <HI>Ghendt,</HI> and brought up the <HI>Scheld</HI> to <HI>Tournay.</HI> The Siege was carried on regularly: No Di&s;turbances was given to the Works by Sallies, &s;o the Town capitulated within a Month, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tournay</HI> is be&s;ieged and taken.</NOTE> the Garri&s;on being allowed to retire into the Citadel, which was counted one of the &s;tronge&s;t in <HI>Europe,</HI> not only fortified with the utmo&s;t Exactne&s;s, but all the Ground was wrought into Mines; &s;o that the Re&s;i&s;tance of the Garri&s;on was not &s;o much apprehended, as the Mi&s;chief they might do by blowing up their Mines. A Capitulation was propo&s;ed, for delivering it up on the fifth of <HI>September,</HI> if it &s;hould not be relieved &s;ooner, and that all Ho&s;tilities &s;hould cea&s;e till then. This was offered by the Garri&s;on, and agreed to by the Duke of <HI>Marlborough;</HI> but the King of <HI>France</HI> would not con&s;ent to it, unle&s;s there were a ge|neral Su&s;pen&s;ion, by the whole Army, of all Ho&s;tilities; and that being rejected, the Siege went on. Many Men were lo&s;t in it, but the Proceeding by Sap prevented much Mi&s;chief; in the end no Relief came, and the Garri&s;on capitulated in the beginning of <HI>September,</HI> but could obtain no better Conditions, than to be made Pri&s;oners of War.</P>
<P>After this Siege was over, <HI>Mons</HI> was inve&s;ted, and the Troops marched thither, as &s;oon as they had levelled their Trenches about <HI>Tournay:</HI> But the Court of <HI>France</HI> re&s;olved to venture a Battle, rather than to look on, and &s;ee &s;o important a Place taken from them. <HI>Boufflers</HI> was &s;ent from Court to join with <HI>Villars,</HI> in the Execution of this De&s;ign: They po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of a Wood, and intrenched them&s;elves &s;o &s;trongly, that in &s;ome places there were three Intrenchments ca&s;t up, one within another. The Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> and Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> &s;aw plainly, it was not po&s;&s;ible to carry on the Siege of <HI>Mons,</HI> while the <HI>French</HI> Army lay
<PB N="533" REF="559">
&s;o near it; &s;o it was nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;lodge them. The Attempt was bold, and they &s;aw the Execution would be difficult, and co&s;t them many Men. This was the &s;harpe&s;t Action in the whole <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Battle of <HI>Blarignies.</HI></NOTE> War, and la&s;ted the longe&s;t. The <HI>French</HI> were po&s;ted &s;o advan|tageou&s;ly, that our Men were oft repul&s;ed; and indeed the <HI>French</HI> maintained their Ground better, and &s;hewed more Courage, than appeared in the whole Cour&s;e of the War: Yet in conclu&s;ion they were driven from all their Po&s;ts, and the Action ended in a com|pleat Victory. The number of Slain was almo&s;t equal on both &s;ides, about 12000 of a &s;ide. We took 500 Officers Pri&s;oners, be&s;ides many Cannon, Standards, and En&s;igns. <HI>Villars</HI> was di&s;|abled by &s;ome Wounds he received, &s;o <HI>Boufflers</HI> made the Retreat in good order. The Military Men have always talked of this, as the &s;harpe&s;t Action in the whole War, not without reflecting on the Generals, for beginning &s;o de&s;perate an Attack. The <HI>French</HI> thought it a &s;ort of a Victory, that they had animated their Men, to fight &s;o well behind Entrenchments, and to repul&s;e our Men &s;o often, and with &s;o great Lo&s;s. They retired to <HI>Valenciennes,</HI> and &s;ecured them&s;elves by ca&s;ting up &s;trong Lines, while they left our Army to carry on the Siege of <HI>Mons,</HI> without giving them the lea&s;t Di&s;turbance. As &s;oon as the Train of Artillery was brought from <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mons</HI> be|&s;ieged and taken.</NOTE> <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> the Siege was carried on with great Vigour, tho' the Sea&s;on was both cold and rainy: The Outworks were carried with little Re&s;i&s;tance, and <HI>Mons</HI> capitulated about the end of <HI>October;</HI> with that the Campaign ended, both Armies retiring into Winter Quarters.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t important thing, that relates to <HI>Italy,</HI> was, that the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in <HI>Italy.</HI></NOTE> Pope delayed acknowledging King <HI>Charles,</HI> by &s;everal pretended Difficulties; his De&s;ign being to &s;tay and &s;ee the I&s;&s;ue of the Cam|paign; but when he was threatened, towards the end of it, that if it was not done, the Imperial Army &s;hould come and take up their Winter Quarters in the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical State, he &s;ubmitted, and ac|knowledged him.

This put their Neighbours under great Apprehen&s;ions, they feared the &s;preading of the Contagion; but it plea&s;ed God, it went no farther. This &s;udden, and, as it &s;eemed, total Rever&s;e of all the De&s;igns of the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> who had been for many Years the Terror of all his Neighbours, made me write to Dr. <HI>Ro|bin&s;on,</HI> who had lived above thirty Years in that Court, and is
<PB N="535" REF="561">
now Bi&s;hop of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> for a particular Character of that King. I &s;hall &s;et it down in his own Words.</P>
<P>He is now in the 28th Year of his Age, tall and &s;lender, &s;toops <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Cha|racter</NOTE> a little, and in his walking di&s;covers, tho' in no great degree, the effect of breaking his Thigh-bone about eight Years ago: He is of a very vigorous and healthy Con&s;titution, takes a plea&s;ure in enduring the greate&s;t Fatigues, and is little curious about his Re|po&s;e: His chief and almo&s;t only Exerci&s;e has been riding, in which he has been extremely exce&s;&s;ive: He u&s;ually eats, with a good Appetite, e&s;pecially in the Morning, which is the be&s;t of his three Meals: He never drinks any thing but &s;mall Beer, and is not much concerned whether it be good or bad: He &s;peaks little, is very thoughtful, and is ob&s;erved to mind nothing &s;o much as his own Affairs, laying his De&s;igns, and contriving the ways of acting, without communicating them to any, till they are to be put in execution: He holds few or no Councils of War; and tho' in Civil Affairs his Mini&s;ters have leave to explain their Thoughts, and are heard very patiently; yet he relies more on his own Judgment, than on theirs, and frequently falls on &s;uch Me|thods, as are farthe&s;t from their Thoughts: So that, both his Mi|ni&s;ters and Generals have hitherto had the Glory of Obedience, without either the Prai&s;e or Blame of having advi&s;ed prudently or otherwi&s;e. The rea&s;on of his Re&s;ervedne&s;s in con&s;ulting others may be thus accounted for; he came, at the Age of Fifteen, to &s;uc|ceed, in an Ab&s;olute Monarchy, and by the forward Zeal of the States of the Kingdom, was in a few Months declared to be of Age: There were tho&s;e about him, that magnified his Under|&s;tanding, as much as his Authority, and in&s;inuated that he neither needed Advice, nor could &s;ubmit his Affairs to the Deli|beration of others, without &s;ome Diminution of his own &s;upreme Power. The&s;e Impre&s;&s;ions had not all their effect, till after the War was begun, in the cour&s;e of which, he &s;urmounted &s;o many Impo&s;&s;ibilities (as tho&s;e about him thought them) that he came to have le&s;s value for their Judgments, and more for his own, and at la&s;t to think nothing impo&s;&s;ible. So it may be truly &s;aid, that under God, as well all his glorious Succe&s;&s;es, as the late fatal Re|ver&s;e of them, have been owing &s;olely to his own Conduct. As to his Piety, it cannot be &s;aid but that the outward Appearances have highly recommended it, only it is not very ea&s;y to account for the exce&s;s of his Revenge again&s;t King <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> and &s;ome other In&s;tances; but he is not &s;u&s;pected of any bodily Indul|gencies. It is mo&s;t certain, he has all along wi&s;hed well to the Allies, and not at all to <HI>France,</HI> which he never intended to &s;erve by any Steps he has made. We hear the <HI>Turks</HI> u&s;e him well, but
<PB N="536" REF="562">
Time mu&s;t &s;hew what u&s;e they will make of him, and how he will get back into his own Kingdom. If this Misfortune does not quite ruin him, it may temper his Fire, and then he may become one of the greate&s;t Princes of the Age. Thus I leave him and his Character.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Denmark</HI> &s;pent a great part of this Summer in a <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in <HI>Denmark.</HI></NOTE> very expen&s;ive cour&s;e of travelling, thro' the Courts of <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> and it was believed he intended to go to <HI>Rome,</HI> where great Preparations were making, for giving him a &s;plendid Recep|tion; for it was given out, that he intended to change his Reli|gion: But whether the&s;e Reports were altogether groundle&s;s, or whether their being &s;o commonly believed, was like to produce &s;ome Di&s;orders in his own Kingdom, is not certainly known; only thus much is certain, that he &s;topt at <HI>Florence,</HI> and went no fur|ther, but returned home; and upon the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>'s Misfor|tunes, entered into Mea&s;ures to attack <HI>Sweden,</HI> with King <HI>Au|gu&s;tus;</HI> who had called a Diet in <HI>Poland,</HI> in which he was ac|knowledged their King, and all things were &s;ettled there, accord|ing to his Wi&s;hes. The King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> upon his return home, &s;ent an Army over the <HI>Sound</HI> into <HI>Schonen;</HI> but his Coun&s;els were &s;o weak, and &s;o ill conducted, that he did not &s;end a Train of Ar|tillery, with other Nece&s;&s;aries, after them: Some Places, that were not tenable, were yielded up by the <HI>Swedes,</HI> and by the Pro|gre&s;s, that he made at fir&s;t, he &s;eemed to be in a fair way of reco|vering that Province; but the <HI>Swedes</HI> brought an Army together, tho' far inferiour to the <HI>Danes</HI> in number, and falling on them, gave them &s;uch an entire Defeat, that the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> was forced to bring back, as well as he could, the broken Remnants of his Army, by which an end was put to that inglorious Ex|pedition.</P>
<P>The <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Army, that was in <HI>Poland,</HI> having got into <HI>Po|merania,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> &s;tudied to engage them to fall into <HI>Saxony,</HI> to embroil the Affairs of <HI>Germany,</HI> and by that means engage the neighbouring Princes, to recall the Troops that were in the Queen's Service, and that of the other Allies in <HI>Flanders;</HI> but the Queen and the <HI>States</HI> interpo&s;ed effectually in this Matter, and the <HI>Swedes</HI> were &s;o &s;en&s;ible, how much they might need their Pro|tection, that they acquie&s;ced in the Propo&s;itions, that were made to them; &s;o the Peace of the Northern Parts of the Empire was &s;ecured. A Peace was likewi&s;e made up, between the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> and the <HI>Czar:</HI> The King of <HI>Sweden</HI> continued &s;till at <HI>Bender;</HI> the War in <HI>Hungary</HI> went &s;till on. The Court of <HI>Vienna</HI> publi&s;hed ample Relations of the great Succe&s;&s;es they had there; but an <HI>Hungarian</HI> a&s;&s;ured me, the&s;e were given out, to

make the Malecontents &s;eem an incon&s;iderable and ruined Party. There were &s;ecret Negotiations &s;till going on, but without effect.</P>
<P>Nothing of Importance pa&s;s'd on the Sea: The <HI>French</HI> put out <NOTE PLACE="marg">Our Flect well con|ducted.</NOTE> no Fleet, and our Convoys were &s;o well ordered, and &s;o happy, that our Merchants made no Complaints: Towards the end of the Year, the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> found the Care of the Fleet a Load too heavy for him to bear, and that he could not di&s;charge it, as it ought to be done; &s;o he de&s;ired leave to lay it down. It was offered to the Earl of <HI>Orford;</HI> but tho' he was willing to &s;erve at the Head of a Commi&s;&s;ion, he refu&s;ed to accept of it &s;ingly; &s;o it was put in Commi&s;&s;ion, in which he was the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>I now come to give an account of the Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, that <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament.</NOTE> came on this Winter. All the Supplies, that were asked, for carrying on the War, were granted, and put on good Funds; in this there was a general unanimous Concurrence: But the great Bu&s;ine&s;s of this Se&s;&s;ion, that took up mo&s;t of their time, and that had great Effects in conclu&s;ion, related to Dr. <HI>Sacheverel:</HI> This being one of the mo&s;t extraordinary Tran&s;actions in my Time, I will relate it very copiou&s;ly. Dr. <HI>Sacheverel</HI> was a bold in&s;olent Man, with a very &s;mall mea&s;ure of Religion, Virtue, Learning, or Good Sen&s;e, but he re&s;olved to force him&s;elf into Popularity and Preferment, by the mo&s;t petulant Railings at Di&s;&s;enters, and Low-Churchmen, in &s;everal Sermons and Libels, wrote without either Cha&s;tne&s;s of Stile, or Liveline&s;s of Expre&s;&s;ion: All was one un|practi&s;ed Strain of indecent and &s;currilous Language. When he had pur&s;ued this Method for &s;everal Years without effect, he was at la&s;t brought up by a popular Election to a Church in <HI>Southwark,</HI> where he began to make great Reflections on the Mini&s;try, re|pre&s;enting that the Church was in danger, being neglected by tho&s;e who governed, while they favoured her mo&s;t inveterate Ene|mies. At the A&s;&s;izes in <HI>Derby</HI> (where he preached before the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sacheverel</HI>'s Sermons.</NOTE> Judges) and on the fifth of <HI>November</HI> (preaching at St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s in <HI>London)</HI> he gave a full vent to his Fury, in the mo&s;t virulent De|clamation, that he could contrive, upon the&s;e Words of St. <HI>Paul's, Perils from Fal&s;e Brethren;</HI> in which, after &s;ome &s;hort Reflections upon Popery, he let him&s;elf loo&s;e into &s;uch Indecencies, that both the Man and the Sermon were univer&s;ally condemned: He a&s;|&s;erted the Doctrine of Non-Re&s;i&s;tance in the highe&s;t &s;train po&s;&s;ible, and &s;aid, that to charge the Revolution with Re&s;i&s;tance, was to ca&s;t black and odious Imputations on it; pretending, that the late King had di&s;owned it, and cited for the Proof of that, &s;ome Words in his Declaration, by which he vindicated him&s;elf from a De&s;ign of Conque&s;t. He poured out much Scorn and Scurrility on the Di&s;&s;enters, and reflected &s;everely on the Toleration; and &s;aid the
<PB N="538" REF="564">
Church was violently attack'd by her Enemies, and loo&s;ely de|fended by her pretended Friends: He animated the People, to &s;tand up for the De&s;ence of the Church, for which he &s;aid he &s;ounded the Trumpet, and de&s;ired them to put on the whole Armour of God. The Court of Aldermen refu&s;ed to de&s;ire him to print his Sermon; but he did print it, pretending it was upon the De&s;ire of <HI>Garrard,</HI> then Lord Mayor, to whom he dedicated it, with an inflaming Epi&s;tle at the head of it. The Party, that oppo&s;ed the Mini&s;try, did &s;o magnify the Sermon, that, as was generally reckoned, about 40000 of them were printed, and di&s;per&s;ed over the Nation. The Queen &s;eemed highly offended at it, and the Mini&s;try looked on it as an Attack made on them, that was not to be de&s;pi&s;ed. The Lord Trea&s;urer was &s;o de|&s;cribed, that it was next to the naming him, &s;o a Parliamentary Impeachment was re&s;olved on; <HI>Eyre,</HI> then Sollicitor General, and others thought the &s;hort way of burning the Sermon, and keep|ing him in Pri&s;on during the Se&s;&s;ion, was the better method; but the more &s;olemn way was unhappily cho&s;en.</P>
<P>There had been, ever &s;ince the Queen came to the Crown, an <NOTE PLACE="marg">Many Books wrote a|gain&s;t the Queen's Title.</NOTE> open Revival of the Doctrine of Pa&s;&s;ive-Obedience and Non-Re&s;i&s;tance, by one <HI>Le&s;ley,</HI> who was the fir&s;t Man that began the War in <HI>Ireland;</HI> &s;aying, in a Speech &s;olemnly made, that King <HI>James,</HI> by declaring him&s;elf a Papi&s;t, could no longer be our King, &s;ince he could not be the Defender of our Faith, nor the Head of our Church, Dignities &s;o inherent in the Crown, that he, who was incapable of the&s;e, could not hold it: A Copy of which Speech, the pre&s;ent Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Dublin</HI> told me he had, under his own hand. As he animated the People with this Speech, &s;o &s;ome Actions followed under his Conduct, in which, &s;everal Men were killed; yet this Man changed &s;ides quickly, and became the violente&s;t Jacobite in the Nation, and was engaged in many Plots, and in writing many Books again&s;t the Revolution, and the pre|&s;ent Government. Soon after the Queen was on the Throne, he, or his Son as &s;ome &s;aid, publi&s;hed a Series of weekly Papers un|der the Title of the <HI>Rebear&s;al,</HI> pur&s;uing a Thread of Arguments in them all, again&s;t the Lawfulne&s;s of Re&s;i&s;tance, in any Ca&s;e what&s;oever; deriving Government wholly from God, denying all Right in the People, either to confer, or to coerce it: The Mi|ni&s;ters connived at this, with what intention God knows.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e &s;editious Papers had a free cour&s;e for many Years, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1710. $span$</NOTE> and were much &s;pread and magnified; one <HI>Hoadly,</HI> a pious and judicious Divine, being called to preach before the Lord Mayor, cho&s;e for his Text the fir&s;t Ver&s;es of the 13th Chapter to the
<PB N="539" REF="565">
<HI>Romans,</HI> and fairly explained the Words there, that they were to be under&s;tood only again&s;t re&s;i&s;ting good Governours, upon the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Principles; but, that tho&s;e Words had no relation to bad and cruel Governours: and he a&s;&s;erted, that it was not only lawful, but a Duty incumbent on all Men, to re&s;i&s;t &s;uch; con|cluding all, with a Vindication of the Revolution, and the pre|&s;ent Government. Upon this, a great Outcry was rai&s;ed, as if he had preached up Rebellion; &s;everal Books were wrote again&s;t him, and he ju&s;tified him&s;elf, with a vi&s;ible Superiority of Argument, to them all, and did &s;o &s;olidly overthrow the Con|ceit of one <HI>Filmer,</HI> now e&s;pou&s;ed by <HI>Le&s;ley</HI> (that Government was derived by Primogeniture from the fir&s;t Patriarchs) that for &s;ome time, he &s;ilenced his Adver&s;aries: but it was an ea&s;ier thing to keep up a Clamour, than to write a &s;olid An&s;wer. <HI>Sacheverel</HI> did, with great Virulence, reflect on him, and on me, and &s;everal other Bi&s;hops, carrying his Venom as far back as to Archbi&s;hop <HI>Grindal,</HI> whom, for his Moderation, he called a perfidious Prelate, and a fal&s;e Son of the Church. When it was moved to impeach him, the Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> being a Member of the Hou&s;e of Commons, was examined to this Point, whether the Sermon was printed at his de&s;ire or order; upon his owning it, he would have been expelled the Hou&s;e; but he denied he had given any &s;uch order, tho' <HI>Sacheverel</HI> affirmed it, and brought Witne&s;&s;es to prove it: Yet the Hou&s;e would not en|ter upon that Examination; but it was thought more decent to &s;eem to give credit to their own Member, tho' indeed few be|lieved him.</P>
<P>Some oppo&s;ition was made to the Motion, for impeaching <HI>Sa|cheverel,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sacheverel</HI> was im|peached by the Hou&s;e of Commons.</NOTE> but it was carried by a great Majority: The Proceedings were &s;low; &s;o tho&s;e, who intended to inflame the City, and the Nation upon that occa&s;ion, had time &s;ufficient given them, for laying their De&s;igns: They gave it out boldly, and in all Places, that a De&s;ign was formed by the Whigs, to pull down the Church, and that this Pro&s;ecution was only &s;et on foot to try their Strength; and that, upon their Succe&s;s in it, they would proceed more openly. Tho' this was all Fal&s;ehood and Forgery, yet it was propagated with &s;o much Application and Zeal, and the Tools imployed in it, were &s;o well &s;upplied with Money (from whom, was not then known) that it is &s;carce credible how generally it was believed.</P>
<P>Some things concurred to put the Vulgar in ill humour; it was a time of Dearth and Scarcity, &s;o that the Poor were much pinched: The Summer before, ten or twelve Thou&s;and poor People of the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> who were reduced to great Mi&s;ery, came into
<PB N="540" REF="566">
<HI>England;</HI> they were well received and &s;upplied, both by the Queen, and by the voluntary Charities of good People: This filled our own Poor with great Indignation; who thought tho&s;e Charities, to which they had a better Right, were thus intercepted by Stran|gers; and all who were ill affected, &s;tudied to heighten the&s;e their Re&s;entments. The Clergy did generally e&s;pou&s;e <HI>Sacheve|rel,</HI> as their Champion, who had &s;tood in the Breach; and &s;o they reckoned his Cau&s;e was their own. Many Sermons were preach|ed, both in <HI>London</HI> and in other Places, to provoke the People, in which they &s;ucceeded beyond expectation. Some Accidents concurred to delay the Proceedings; much time was &s;pent in preparing the Articles of Impeachment: And the An&s;wer was, by many &s;hifts, long delayed: It was bold, without either Sub|mi&s;&s;ion or common Re&s;pect; he ju&s;tified every thing in his Ser|mon, in a very haughty and a&s;&s;uming Stile. In conclu&s;ion, the Lords ordered the Trial to be at the Bar of their Hou&s;e; but tho&s;e who found, that by gaining more time, the People were &s;till more inflamed, moved that the Trial might be publick in <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter Hall;</HI> where the whole Hou&s;e of Commons might be pre&s;ent: This took &s;o with unthinking People, that it could not be with&s;tood, tho' the Effects it would have, were well fore|&s;een: The preparing <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall</HI> was a Work of &s;ome Weeks.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, on the 27th of <HI>February,</HI> the Trial begun. <HI>Sache|verel</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">And tried in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall.</HI></NOTE> was lodged in the <HI>Temple,</HI> and came every day with great Solemnity, in a Coach to the <HI>Hall;</HI> great Crouds ran about his Coach with many Shouts expre&s;&s;ing their Concern for him, in a very rude and tumultuous manner. The Trial la&s;ted three Weeks, in which all other Bu&s;ine&s;s was at a &s;tand; for this took up all Mens Thoughts: The Managers for the Commons opened the Matter very &s;olemnly: Their Performances were much and ju&s;tly commended: <HI>Jekyll, Eyre, Stanhope, King,</HI> but above all <HI>Parker,</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in a very particular manner: They did copiou&s;ly ju&s;tify both the Revolution, and the Pre&s;ent Admini&s;tration. There was no need of Witne&s;&s;es; for the Ser|mon being owned by him, all the Evidence was brought from it, by laying his Words together, and by &s;hewing his Intent and Meaning in them, which appeared from comparing one place with another. When his Council, Sir <HI>Simon Harcourt, Dodd, Phipps,</HI> and two others, came to plead for him, they very freely acknow|ledged the Lawfulne&s;s of Re&s;i&s;tance in extreme Ca&s;es, and plainly ju&s;tified the Revolution, and our Deliverance by King <HI>William:</HI> But they &s;aid, it was not fit, in a Sermon, to name &s;uch an Ex|ception; that the Duties of Morality ought to be delivered in
<PB N="541" REF="567">
their full extent, without &s;uppo&s;ing an extraordinary Ca&s;e: And therefore <HI>Sacheverel</HI> had followed Precedents, &s;et by our greate&s;t Divines, ever &s;ince the Reformation, and ever &s;ince the Revolu|tion. Upon this, they opened a great Field; they began with the Declarations made in King <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIIth's Time; they in&s;i&s;ted next, upon the Homilies, and from thence in&s;tanced in a large Series of Bi&s;hops and Divines, who had preached the Duty of Submi&s;&s;ion and Non-Re&s;i&s;tance, in very full Terms, without &s;uppo&s;ing any Exception; &s;ome excluding all Exceptions, in as po&s;itive a manner, as he had done: They explained the Word <HI>Revolution,</HI> as belonging to the new Settlement upon King <HI>James</HI>'s withdrawing; tho', in the common Acceptation, it was under&s;tood of the whole Tran&s;action, from the landing of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Army, till the Settlement made by the Convention. So they under&s;tanding the Revolution in that Sen&s;e, there was indeed no <HI>Re&s;i&s;tance</HI> there: If the Pa&s;&s;age, quoted from the Declaration, given out by the late King, while he was Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> did not come up to that, for which he quoted it; he ought not to be cen&s;ured becau&s;e his Quotation did not fully prove his Point. As for his Invective again&s;t the Di&s;&s;enters and the Toleration, they laboured to turn that off, by &s;aying, he did not reflect on what was allowed by Law, but on the permi&s;&s;ion of, or the not puni&s;h|ing many, who publi&s;hed impious and bla&s;phemous Books: And a Collection was made, of Pa&s;&s;ages in Books, full of crude Im|piety and of bold Opinions. This gave great offence to many, who thought that this was a &s;olemn publi&s;hing of &s;o much Im|piety to the Nation, by which more mi&s;chief would be done, than by the Books them&s;elves; for mo&s;t of them had been neg|lected, and known only to a &s;mall number, of tho&s;e who encouraged them: And the Authors, of many of the&s;e Books, had been pro|&s;ecuted and puni&s;hed for them. As to tho&s;e Parts of the Sermon, that &s;et out the Danger the Church was in, tho' both Hou&s;es had &s;ome Years ago voted it a great Offence, to &s;ay it was in danger, they &s;aid it might have been in none four Years ago, when the&s;e Votes pa&s;s'd, and yet be now in danger: The greate&s;t of all Dan|gers was to be apprehended, from the Wrath of God for &s;uch Im|pieties. They &s;aid, the Reflections on the Admini&s;tration were not meant of tho&s;e, imployed immediately by the Queen, but of Men in inferior Po&s;ts: If his Words &s;eemed capable of a bad Sen&s;e, they were al&s;o capable of a more innocent one; and every Man was allowed to put any Con&s;truction on his Words, that they could bear. When the Coun&s;el had ended their Defence, <HI>Sache|verel</HI> concluded it with a Speech, which he read with much bold Heat; in which, with many &s;olemn A&s;&s;everations, he ju&s;tified
<PB N="542" REF="568">
his Intentions towards the Queen and her Government; he &s;poke with re&s;pect, both of the Revolution and the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;|&s;ion; he in&s;i&s;ted mo&s;t on condemning all Re&s;i&s;tance, under any Pretence what&s;oever, without mentioning the exception of ex|treme Nece&s;&s;ity, as his Coun&s;el had done: he &s;aid, it was the Doctrine of the Church, in which he was bred up; and added many pathetical Expre&s;&s;ions, to move the Audience to Compa&s;|&s;ion. This had a great effect on the weaker &s;ort, while it po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed tho&s;e, who knew the Man and his ordinary Di&s;cour&s;es, with Horror, when they heard him affirm &s;o many Fal&s;ehoods, with &s;uch &s;olemn Appeals to God. It was very plain the Speech was made for him by others; for the Stile was correct, and far different from his own.</P>
<P>During the Trial, the Multitudes that followed him, all the <NOTE PLACE="marg">A great Di&s;|order at that time.</NOTE> way as he came, and as he went back, &s;hewed a great concern for him, pre&s;&s;ing about him, and &s;triving to ki&s;s his Hand: Mo|ney was thrown among them; and they were animated to &s;uch a pitch of Fury, that they went to pull down &s;ome Meeting-hou&s;es, which was executed on five of them, as far as burning all the Pews in them. This was directed by &s;ome of better Fa&s;hion, who followed the Mob in Hackney Coaches, and were &s;een &s;ending Me&s;&s;ages to them: The Word, upon which all &s;houted, was <HI>The Church and Sacheverel:</HI> And &s;uch, as joined not in the Shout, were in&s;ulted and knocked down: Before my own Door, One, with a Spade, cleft the Skull of another, who would not &s;hout as they did. There happened to be a Meeting-hou&s;e near me, out of which they drew every thing, that was in it, and burned it before the Door of the Hou&s;e. They threatened to do the like Execution on my Hou&s;e; but the Noi&s;e of the Riot coming to Court, Orders were &s;ent to the Guards to go about, and di&s;per&s;e the Multitudes, and &s;ecure the publick Peace. As the Guards advanced, the People ran away; &s;ome few were only taken; the&s;e were afterwards pro&s;ecuted; but the Party &s;hewed a violent concern for them; two of them were condemned as guilty of High Trea&s;on; &s;mall Fines were &s;et on the re&s;t; but no Execution followed; and after &s;ome Months, they were par|doned: and indeed this Remi&s;&s;ne&s;s, in puni&s;hing &s;o great a Di&s;|order, was looked on as the preparing and encouraging Men to new Tumults. There was a &s;ecret Management in this Mat|ter, that amazed all People: for tho' the Queen, upon an Ad|dre&s;s made to her by the Hou&s;e of Commons, &s;et out a Procla|mation, in which this Riot was, with &s;evere Words, laid upon Papi&s;ts and Nonjurors, who were certainly the chief Promoters of it; yet the Proceedings afterwards did not an&s;wer the Threat|nings of the Proclamation.</P>
<P><PB N="543" REF="569">
When <HI>Sacheverel</HI> had ended his Defence, the Managers for the Hou&s;e of Commons replied, and &s;hewed very evidently, that the Words of his Sermon could not rea&s;onably bear any other <NOTE PLACE="marg">Continua|tion of the Trial.</NOTE> Sen&s;e, but that for which they had charged him; this was an ea&s;y Performance, and they managed it with great life: but the humour of the Town was turned again&s;t them, and all the Clergy appeared for <HI>Sacheverel.</HI> Many of the Queen's Chaplains &s;tood about him, encouraging and magnifying him; and it was given out, that the Queen her&s;elf favoured him: Tho', upon my fir&s;t coming to Town, which was after the Impeachment was brought up to the Lords, &s;he &s;aid to me, that it was a bad Sermon, and that he de&s;erved well to be puni&s;hed for it. All her Mini&s;ters, who were in the Hou&s;e of Commons, were named to be Managers, and they &s;poke very zealou&s;ly for publick Liberty, ju&s;tifying the Revolu|tion. <HI>Holt,</HI> the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice of the <HI>King's Bench,</HI> died during <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir <HI>John Holt</HI>'s Death and Cha|racter.</NOTE> the Trial: He was very learned in the Law, and had upon great Occa&s;ions &s;hewed an intrepid Zeal in a&s;&s;erting its Authority; for he ventured on the Indignation of both Hou&s;es of Parliament by turns, when he thought the Law was with him: He was a Man of good Judgment and great Integrity, and &s;et him&s;elf with great Application to the Functions of that important Po&s;t. Imme|diately upon his Death, <HI>Parker</HI> was made Lord Chief Ju&s;tice: <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Parker</HI> made Lord Chief Ju&s;tice.</NOTE> This great Promotion &s;eemed an evident Demon&s;tration of the Queen's approving the Pro&s;ecution; for none of the Managers had treated <HI>Sacheverel</HI> &s;o &s;everely as he had done; yet &s;ecret Whi&s;pers were very confidently &s;et about, that tho' the Queen's Affairs put her on acting the Part of one, that was plea&s;ed with this Scene, yet &s;he di&s;liked it all, and would take the fir&s;t occa|&s;ion to &s;hew it.</P>
<P>After the Trial was ended, the Debate was taken up in the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Debates $word$ the Hou&s;e of Lords $word$ the Trial.</NOTE> Hou&s;e of Lords: It &s;tuck long on the fir&s;t Article; none pre|tended to ju&s;tify the Sermon, or to a&s;&s;ert ab&s;olute Non-Re&s;i&s;tance: All who favoured him, went upon this, that the Duty of Obe|dience ought to be delivered in full and general Words, without putting odd Exceptions, or &s;uppo&s;ing odious Ca&s;es: This had been the Method of all our Divines. Pains were al&s;o taken to &s;hew, that his Sermon did not reflect on the Revolution: On the other hand, it was &s;aid, that &s;ince the Revolution had happened &s;o lately, and was made &s;till the Subject of much Controver&s;y, tho&s;e ab&s;olute Expre&s;&s;ions did plainly condemn it. The Revolution was the whole Progre&s;s of the Turn, from the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s landing, till the Act of Settlement pa&s;s'd. The Act of Parlia|ment expre&s;&s;ed, what was meant, by the Abdication and the Va|cancy of the Throne; that it did not only relate to King <HI>James</HI>'s
<PB N="544" REF="570">
withdrawing him&s;elf, but to his cea&s;ing to govern according to our Con&s;titution and Laws, &s;etting up his meer Will and Plea|&s;ure, as the Mea&s;ure of his Government: This was made plainer, by another Clau&s;e in the Acts then pa&s;s'd, which provided, that if any of our Princes &s;hould become Papi&s;ts, or marry Papi&s;ts, the Subjects were, in tho&s;e Ca&s;es, declared to be free from their Allegiance. Some of the Bi&s;hops &s;poke in this Debate on each &s;ide; <HI>Hooper,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Bath and Wells,</HI> &s;poke in ex|cu&s;e of <HI>Sacheverel:</HI> But <HI>Talbot,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Oxford; Wake,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Lincoln;</HI> and <HI>Trimnel,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Norwich,</HI> and my&s;elf, &s;poke on the other &s;ide. We &s;hewed the Fal&s;ehood of an Opinion too commonly received, that the Church of <HI>England</HI> had always condemned Re&s;i&s;tance, even in the Ca&s;es of extreme Tyranny: The Books of the <HI>Maccabees,</HI> bound in our Bibles, and approved by our Articles, (as containing Examples of Life and In&s;truction of Manners, tho' not as any Part of the Ca|non of the Scripture) contained a full and clear Precedent for re&s;i&s;ting and &s;haking off extreme Tyranny: The <HI>Jews,</HI> under that brave Family, not only defended them&s;elves again&s;t <HI>Antio|chus,</HI> but formed them&s;elves into a free and new Government. Our Homilies were only again&s;t wilful Rebellion, &s;uch as had been then again&s;t our Kings, while they were governing by Law: But at that very time, Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> had a&s;&s;i&s;ted, fir&s;t the <HI>Scotch,</HI> and then the <HI>French,</HI> and to the end of her Days conti|tinued to protect the <HI>States,</HI> who not only re&s;i&s;ted, but, as the <HI>Maccabees</HI> had done, &s;hook off the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Yoke, and &s;et up a new Form of Government: In all this &s;he was not only ju&s;tified by the be&s;t Writers of that time, &s;uch as <HI>Jewel</HI> and <HI>Bil&s;on,</HI> but was approved and &s;upported in it: Both her Parliaments and Convocations gave her Sub&s;idies, to carry on tho&s;e Wars. The &s;ame Principles were kept up all King <HI>James</HI>'s Reign: In the beginning of King <HI>Charles</HI>'s Reign, he protected the <HI>Rochellers,</HI> and asked Supplies from the Parliament, to enable him to do it effectually; and ordered a Fa&s;t and Prayers to be made for them. It is true, &s;oon after that, new Notions of ab&s;olute Power, derived from God to Kings, were taken up; at the fir&s;t Ri&s;e gi|ven to the&s;e by <HI>Manwaring,</HI> they were condemned by a Sen|tence of the Lords; and tho' he &s;ubmitted, and retracted his Opi|nion, yet a &s;evere Cen&s;ure pa&s;&s;ed upon him: But during the long Di&s;continuance of Parliaments that followed, this Doctrine was more favoured; it was generally preached up, and many things were done pur&s;uant to it, which put the Nation into the great Convul&s;ions, that followed in our Civil Wars. After the&s;e were over, it was natural to return to the other Extreme, as
<PB N="545" REF="571">
Courts naturally favour &s;uch Doctrines. K. <HI>James</HI> tru&s;ted too much to it; yet the very A&s;&s;ertors of that Doctrine were the fir&s;t, who pleaded for Re&s;i&s;tance, when they thought they needed it. Here was Matter for a long Debate: It was carried by a Majority of Seventeen, that the fir&s;t Article was proved. The Party, that was for <HI>Sacheverel,</HI> made no Oppo&s;ition to the Votes upon the fol|lowing Articles; but contented them&s;elves, with prote&s;ting again&s;t them: The Lords went down to the Hall, where the Que&s;tion be|ing put upon the whole Impeachment, <HI>Guilty</HI> or <HI>Not Guilty,</HI> Fifty|two voted him <HI>Not Guilty,</HI> and Sixty-nine voted him <HI>Guilty.</HI></P>
<P>The next Debate was, what Cen&s;ure ought to pa&s;s upon him: And here a &s;trange Turn appeared; &s;ome &s;eemed to apprehend <NOTE PLACE="marg">He is cen|&s;ured very gently.</NOTE> the Effects of a Popular Fury, if the Cen&s;ure was &s;evere; to others it was &s;aid, that the Queen de&s;ired it might be mild; &s;o it was propo&s;ed to &s;u&s;pend him from preaching for one Year; others were for &s;ix Years; but by a Vote it was fixed to three Years. It was next moved, that he &s;hould be incapable of all Preferment for tho&s;e three Years; upon that, the Hou&s;e was divided, Fifty-nine were for the Vote, and Sixty were again&s;t it: &s;o that being laid a&s;ide, the Sermon was ordered to be burnt, in the pre&s;ence of the Lord Mayor, and the Sheriffs of <HI>London,</HI> and this was done; only the Lord Mayor, being a Member of the Hou&s;e of Commons, did not think he was bound to be pre&s;ent. The Lords al&s;o voted, that the Decrees of the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Oxford,</HI> pa&s;&s;ed in 1683, in which the ab&s;olute Authority of Princes, and the Unalterablene&s;s of the Hereditary Right of &s;ucceeding to the Crown, were a&s;|&s;erted in a very high Strain, &s;hould be burnt with <HI>Sacheverel</HI>'s Sermon: The Hou&s;e of Commons likewi&s;e ordered the impious Collection of bla&s;phemous Expre&s;&s;ions, that <HI>Sacheverel</HI> had printed as his Ju&s;tification, to be al&s;o burnt.</P>
<P>When this mild Judgment was given, tho&s;e, who had &s;up|ported him during the Trial, expre&s;&s;ed an inconceivable Glad|ne&s;s, as if they had got a Victory; Bonefires, Illuminations, and other Marks of Joy appeared, not only in <HI>London,</HI> but over the whole Kingdom.</P>
<P>This had yet greater Effects; Addre&s;&s;es were &s;et on foot, from <NOTE PLACE="marg">Addre&s;&s;es again&s;t the Pa$$$$ment.</NOTE> all the Parts of the Nation, in which the Ab&s;olute Power of our Princes was a&s;&s;erted, and all Re&s;i&s;tance was condemned, under the De&s;ignation of Antimonarchical and Republican Principles; the Queen's Hereditary Right was acknowledged, and yet a Zeal for the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion was likewi&s;e pretended, to make tho&s;e Addre&s;&s;es pa&s;s the more ea&s;ily, with unthinking Multitudes: Mo&s;t of the&s;e concluded, with an Intimation of their Hopes, that the Queen would di&s;&s;olve the pre&s;ent Parliament, giving A&s;|&s;urances,
<PB N="546" REF="572">
that in a new Election, they would choo&s;e none, but &s;uch as &s;hould be faithful to the Crown, and zealous for the Church: The&s;e were at fir&s;t more coldly received; for the Queen either made no An&s;wer at all, or made them in very general Words. Addre&s;&s;es were brought upon the other hand, magnifying the Conduct of the Parliament, and expre&s;&s;ing a Zeal for main|taining the Revolution and the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In the beginning of <HI>April</HI> the Parliament was prorogued, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen's Speech.</NOTE> the Queen, in her Speech thereupon, expre&s;&s;ed her concern, that there was Cau&s;e given for that, which had taken up &s;o much of their Time, wi&s;hing that all her People would be quiet, and mind their own Bu&s;ine&s;s; adding, that in all Times there was too much occa&s;ion given to complain of Impiety, but that &s;he would continue that Zeal, which &s;he had hitherto expre&s;&s;ed for Religion, and for the Church: This &s;eemed to look a different way from the Whi&s;pers that had been &s;et about. Soon after that, &s;he made a Step that revived them again: The Duke of <HI>Shrew&s;|bury</HI> had gone out of <HI>England</HI> in the end of the former Reign, thinking, as he gave out, that a warmer Climate was nece&s;&s;ary for his Health: He &s;taid &s;everal Years at <HI>Rome,</HI> where he became acquainted with a <HI>Roman</HI> Lady: And &s;he, upon his leaving <HI>Rome</HI> to return to <HI>England,</HI> went after him to <HI>Augsbourg,</HI> where &s;he overtook him, and declared her&s;elf a Prote&s;tant; upon which, he married her there, and came with her back to <HI>England,</HI> in the Year 1706. Upon his Return, the Whigs lived in Civilities <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Duke of $word$</HI> $word$ <HI>Lo$d $span$er|$word$.</HI></NOTE> with him; but they thought his leaving <HI>England,</HI> and his living &s;o long out of it, while we were in &s;o much danger at home, and his &s;trange Marriage, gave ju&s;t cau&s;e of Su&s;picion. The Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Godolphin,</HI> lived &s;till in Friend&s;hips with him, and &s;tudied to overcome the Jealou&s;ies, that the Whigs had of him; for they generally believed, that he had advi&s;ed the late King to the Change he made in his Mini&s;try, towards the end of his Reign. He &s;eemed not to be concerned at the di&s;|tance, in which he was kept from Bu&s;ine&s;s; but in the late Trial, he left the Whigs in every Vote; and a few days after the Parlia|ment was prorogued, the Queen, without communicating the Matter to any of her Mini&s;ters, took the <HI>Chamberlain's</HI> White Staff from the Marquis of <HI>Kent,</HI> (whom, in recompence for that, the advanced to be a Duke) and gave it to the Duke of <HI>Shrewsbury.</HI> This gave a great Alarm; for it was upon that concluded, that a total change of the Mini&s;try would quickly follow; the change of Principles, that he had di&s;covered in the Trial, was imputed to a &s;ecret Management between him and <HI>Harley,</HI> with the new Favourite. The Queen's Inclination to her, and her Alie|nation
<PB N="547" REF="573">
from the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> did encrea&s;e, and broke out in many little things, not worth naming: Upon that, the Dutche&s;s retired from the Court, and appeared no more at it. The Duke of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> gave the Mini&s;ters very po&s;itive A&s;|&s;urances, that his Principles were the &s;ame they had been during the la&s;t Reign, and were in no re&s;pect altered: Upon which, he de&s;ired to enter into Confidences with them; but there was now too much ground given for Su&s;picion.</P>
<P>During this Winter, I was encouraged by the Queen, to &s;peak <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen was &s;poke to with great Freedom.</NOTE> more freely to her of her Affairs, than I had ever ventured to do formerly; I told her what Reports were &s;ecretly &s;pread of her, thro' the Nation, as if &s;he favoured the De&s;ign of bringing the <HI>Pretender,</HI> to &s;ucceed to the Crown, upon a Bargain that &s;he &s;hould hold it during her Life: I was &s;ure the&s;e Reports were &s;pread about by Per&s;ons, who were in the Confidence of tho&s;e, that were believed to know her Mind; I was well a&s;&s;ured, that the <HI>Jacobites</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> had, upon her coming to the Crown, &s;ent up one <HI>Ogilby</HI> of <HI>Boyne,</HI> who was in great e&s;teem among them, to propo&s;e the Bargain to her; he, when he went back, gave the Party full A&s;&s;urances that &s;he accepted of it: this I had from &s;ome of the Lords of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who were then in the Se|cret with the profe&s;&s;ed <HI>Jacobites.</HI> The Earl <HI>Cromarty</HI> made a Speech in Parliament, as was formerly mentioned, contradicting this, and alluding to the Di&s;tinction of the <HI>Calvini&s;ts,</HI> made be|tween the &s;ecret and the revealed Will of God; he a&s;&s;ured them, the Queen had no &s;ecret Will, contrary to that which &s;he de|clared: Yet at the &s;ame time his Brother gave the Party A&s;|&s;urances to the contrary. I told the Queen all this; and &s;aid, if &s;he was capable of making &s;uch a Bargain for her&s;elf, by which her People were to be delivered up, and &s;acrificed after her Death, as it would darken all the Glory of her Reign, &s;o it mu&s;t &s;et all her People to con&s;ider of the mo&s;t proper ways of &s;ecuring them|&s;elves, by bringing over the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ors; in which, I told her plainly I would concur, if &s;he did not take effectual means to extingui&s;h tho&s;e Jealou&s;ies. I told her, her Mini&s;ters had &s;erved her with that Fidelity, and &s;uch Succe&s;s, that her making a change among them would amaze all the World. The Glory of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Reign aro&s;e from the Firmne&s;s of her Coun&s;els, and the Continuance of her Mini&s;ters, as the three la&s;t Reigns, in which the Mini&s;try was often changed, had &s;uffered extremely by it. I al&s;o &s;hewed her, that if &s;he &s;uffered the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s Party to prepare the Nation, for his &s;ucceeding her, &s;he ought not to imagine, that when they thought they had fixed that Matter, they would &s;tay for the natural End of her Life; but that they would
<PB N="548" REF="574">
find ways to &s;horten it: nor did I think it was to be doubted, but that in 1708, when the <HI>Pretender</HI> was upon the Sea, they had laid &s;ome A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inates here, who, upon the News of his landing, would have tried to di&s;patch her. It was certain, that their Inte|re&s;t led them to it, as it was known that their Principles did al|low of it. This, with a great deal more to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, I laid before the Queen; &s;he heard me patiently; &s;he was for the mo&s;t part &s;ilent: yet, by what &s;he &s;aid, &s;he &s;eemed de&s;irous to make me think, &s;he agreed to what I laid before her; but I found afterwards it had no effect upon her: Yet I had great quiet in my own Mind, &s;ince I had, with an hone&s;t Freedom, made the be&s;t u&s;e I could of the Acce&s;s I had to her.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> went beyond Sea in <HI>February,</HI> to prepare all Matters for an early Campaign, de&s;igning to open it in <HI>April,</HI> which was done: The <HI>French</HI> had wrought &s;o long upon their Lines, that it was thought, they would have taken as much care in maintaining them; but upon the Advance of our Army, they abandoned them. And tho' they &s;eemed re&s;olved to make a &s;tand upon the <HI>Scarp,</HI> yet they ran from that likewi&s;e; and this opened the way all on to <HI>Doway:</HI> So that was inve&s;ted. The Garri&s;on was 8000 &s;trong, well furni&s;hed with every thing <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Doway</HI> be|&s;ieged and taken.</NOTE> nece&s;&s;ary to make a brave Defence; the Be&s;ieged &s;allied out of|ten, &s;ometimes with Advantage, but much oftener with Lo&s;s; it was the middle of <HI>May</HI> before the <HI>French</HI> could bring their Army together; it appeared, that they re&s;olved to &s;tand upon the defen&s;ive, tho' they had brought up together a va&s;t Army of two Hundred Battallions, and three Hundred Squadrons: They lay before <HI>Arras,</HI> and advanced to the Plains of <HI>Lens; Villars</HI> com|manded, and made &s;uch Speeches to his Army, that it was ge|nerally believed, he would venture on a Battle, rather than look on and &s;ee <HI>Doway</HI> lo&s;t. The Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> and Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> po&s;ted their Army &s;o advantageou&s;ly, both to cover the Siege, and to receive the Enemy, that he dur&s;t not attack them; but after he had looked on a few Days, in which the two Armies were not above a League di&s;tant, he drew off: So the Siege going on, and no Relief appearing, both <HI>Doway</HI> and the <HI>Fort E&s;carp</HI> capitulated on the 14th of <HI>June.</HI></P>
<P>I have now compleated my fir&s;t De&s;ign in Writting, which <NOTE PLACE="marg">Th$span$.</NOTE> was to give a Hi&s;tory of our Affairs for fifty Years, from the 29th of <HI>May</HI> 1660: So if I confined my&s;elf to that, I &s;hould here give over: But the War &s;eeming now to be near an end, and the Peace, in which it mu&s;t end, being that which will probably give a new Settlement to all <HI>Europe,</HI> as well as to our Affairs, I
<PB N="549" REF="575">
re&s;olve to carry on this Work to the Conclu&s;ion of the War. And therefore I begin with the Progre&s;s of the Negotiations for Peace, which &s;eemed now to be pro&s;ecuted with warmth.</P>
<P>All the former Winter, an Intercour&s;e of Letters was kept up <NOTE PLACE="marg">Negotia|tions for a Peace.</NOTE> between <HI>Pettecum</HI> and <HI>Torcy,</HI> to try if an Expedient could be found, to &s;often that Article, for the Reduction of <HI>Spain,</HI> to the Obe|dience of King <HI>Charles;</HI> which was the Thirty-&s;eventh Article of the Preliminaries: It &s;till was kept in agitation upon the foot of offering three Towns, to be put into the hands of the Allies, to be re&s;tored by them, when the Affairs of <HI>Spain</HI> &s;hould be &s;ettled; otherwi&s;e to be &s;till retained by them. The meaning of which was no other, than that <HI>France</HI> was willing to lo&s;e three more Towns, in ca&s;e King <HI>Philip</HI> &s;hould keep <HI>Spain</HI> and the <HI>We&s;t-Indies:</HI> The Places therefore ought to have born &s;ome Equality to that, for which they were to be given in pawn; but the An&s;wers the <HI>French</HI> made to every Propo&s;ition, &s;hewed they meant nothing but to amu&s;e and di&s;tract the Allies. The fir&s;t Demand the Allies made, was of the Places in <HI>Spain,</HI> then in the hands of the King of <HI>France;</HI> for the delivering up the&s;e, might have been a good &s;tep to the Reduction of the whole: But this was flatly refu&s;ed; and, that the King of <HI>France</HI> might put it out of his power to treat about it, he ordered his Troops to be drawn out of all the &s;trong Places in <HI>Spain,</HI> and &s;oon after out of that Kingdom, pre|tending he was thereby evacuating it; tho' the <HI>French</HI> Forces were kept &s;till in the Neighbourhood: So a &s;hew was made of leaving <HI>Spain</HI> to defend it&s;elf. And upon that, King <HI>Philip</HI> prevailed on the <HI>Spa|niards,</HI> to make great Efforts, beyond what was ever expected of them. This was done by the <HI>French</HI> King, to deceive both the Allies and his own Subjects, who were calling loudly for a Peace: And it likewi&s;e ea&s;ed him of a great part of the Charge, that <HI>Spain</HI> had put him to. But while his Troops were called out of that Kingdom, as many de&s;erted, by a vi&s;ible Connivance, as made up &s;everal Battalions: And all the <HI>Walloon</HI> Regiments, as being Subjects of <HI>Spain,</HI> were &s;ent thither: So that King <HI>Philip</HI> was not weakened by the recalling the <HI>French</HI> Troops; and by this means, the Places in <HI>Spain</HI> could not be any more demanded. The next, as mo&s;t important towards the Reduction of <HI>Spain,</HI> was the Demand that <HI>Bayonne</HI> and <HI>Perpignan</HI> might be put into the hands of the Allies, with <HI>Thionville</HI> on the &s;ide of the Empire. By the two former, all Communication between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> would be cut off, and the Allies would be enabled to &s;end Forces thither, with le&s;s Expence and Trouble: But it was &s;aid, the&s;e were the Keys of <HI>France,</HI> which the King could not part with; &s;o it remained to treat of Towns on the Frontier of the
<PB N="550" REF="576">
<HI>Netherlands;</HI> and even there they excepted <HI>Doway, Arras,</HI> and <HI>Cambray:</HI> &s;o that all their Offers appeared illu&s;ory; and the Intercour&s;e by Letters was for &s;ome time let fall. But in the end of the former Year, <HI>Torcy</HI> wrote to <HI>Pettecum,</HI> to de&s;ire, either that Pa&s;&s;es might be granted to &s;ome Mini&s;ters to come to <HI>Hol|land,</HI> to go on with the Negotiation, or that <HI>Pettecum</HI> might be &s;uffered to go to <HI>Paris,</HI> to &s;ee if an Expedient could be found: and the <HI>States</HI> con&s;ented to the la&s;t. In the mean while, King <HI>Philip</HI> publi&s;hed a <HI>Manife&s;to,</HI> prote&s;ting again&s;t all that &s;hould be tran&s;acted at the <HI>Hague,</HI> to his prejudice; declaring his Re&s;olu|tion to adhere to his faithful <HI>Spaniards:</HI> He al&s;o named Plenipo|tentiaries, to go in his name to the Treaty, who gave the <HI>States</HI> notice of their Powers and In&s;tructions; and, in a Letter to the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> they gave Intimations, how grateful King <HI>Philip</HI> would be to him, if by his means the&s;e his De&s;ires might be complied with; as the like In&s;inuations had been often made by the <HI>French</HI> Agents: But no notice was taken of this Me&s;&s;age from King <HI>Philip,</HI> nor was any An&s;wer given to it. <HI>Pettecum,</HI> after &s;ome days &s;tay at <HI>Paris,</HI> came back without the pretence of offering any Expedient, but brought a Paper, that &s;eemed to &s;et a&s;ide the Preliminaries: yet it &s;et forth, that the King was willing to treat on the Foundation of the Conce&s;&s;ions made in them to the Allies; and that the Execution of all the Articles &s;hould be|gin after the Ratification. This de&s;troyed all that had been hi|therto done; and the di&s;tinction, the King had formerly made, between the Spirit and the Letter of the <HI>Partition Treaty,</HI> &s;hewed how little he was to be relied on: So the <HI>States</HI> re&s;olved to in&s;i&s;t, both on the Preliminaries, and on the Execution of them, be|fore a general Treaty &s;hould be opened. By this Me&s;&s;age, all Thoughts of a Treaty were at a full &s;tand. In the beginning of <HI>February</HI> another Project was &s;ent, which was an Amplification of that, brought by <HI>Pettecum;</HI> only the re&s;toring the two Elec|tors was in&s;i&s;ted on as a Preliminary, as al&s;o the re&s;toring the Up|per Palatinate to the Elector of <HI>Bavaria;</HI> but the Allies &s;till in|&s;i&s;ted on the former Preliminaries. The Court of <HI>France</HI> &s;eeing, that the <HI>States</HI> were not to be wrought on, to go off from the Preliminaries, &s;ent another Me&s;&s;age to them, that the King agreed to all the Preliminaries, except the Thirty-&s;eventh; and if they would con&s;ent, that his Mini&s;ters &s;hould come and confer with them upon that Article, he did not doubt, but what &s;hould be propo&s;ed from him, would be to their Satisfaction. This &s;eemed to give &s;ome Hopes, &s;o the <HI>States</HI> re&s;olved to &s;end the Pa&s;&s;ports; but they fore&s;aw the ill Effects, of &s;uffering the <HI>French</HI> Mini&s;ters to come into their Country, who, by their Agents, were every

<P>The Mini&s;ters &s;ent by <HI>France,</HI> were the Marquis <HI>d'Uxelles</HI> and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Confe|rences at <HI>Gertruy|denburg.</HI></NOTE> the Abbot <HI>de Polignac;</HI> and tho&s;e from the <HI>States,</HI> were <HI>Buys</HI> and <HI>Vanderdu&s;&s;en:</HI> The Conferences began in <HI>March.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> propo&s;ed, that the Dominions in <HI>Italy,</HI> with the I&s;lands, &s;hould be given to one of the Competitors for the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Mo|narchy, without naming which; but it was under&s;tood, that they meant King <HI>Philip:</HI> The Deputies did not ab&s;olutely reject this; but &s;hewed, that the Emperor would never con&s;ent to parting with <HI>Naples,</HI> nor giving the <HI>French</HI> &s;uch footing in <HI>Italy;</HI> the <HI>French</HI> &s;eemed to be &s;en&s;ible of this: The fir&s;t Conference ended, upon the return of the Courier, whom they &s;ent to <HI>Ver|&s;ailles.</HI> They moved for another Conference; and upon &s;everal Propo&s;itions, there were &s;everal Conferences renewed. The King of <HI>France</HI> de&s;i&s;ted from the Demand of <HI>Naples,</HI> but in&s;i&s;ted on that of the Places on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Tu&s;cany:</HI> At la&s;t they de&s;i&s;ted from that too, and in&s;i&s;ted only on <HI>Sicily</HI> and <HI>Sardinia:</HI> So now the Partition &s;eemed as it were &s;ettled. Upon which, the Depu|ties of the <HI>States</HI> pre&s;&s;ed the Mini&s;ters of <HI>France</HI> to give them &s;olid A&s;&s;urances of King <HI>Philip</HI>'s quitting <HI>Spain</HI> and the <HI>We&s;t-Indies;</HI> to this (upon Adverti&s;ement given to the Court of <HI>France)</HI> they an&s;wered, that the King would enter into Mea&s;ures with them to force it. Many Difficulties were &s;tarted, about the Troops to be imployed, what their number &s;hould be, and who &s;hould command them; all which &s;hewed the Execution would prove impracticable. Then they talked of a Sum of Money, to be paid annually, during the War; and here new Difficulties aro&s;e, both in &s;ettling the Sum, and in &s;ecuring the Payment: They offered the Bankers of <HI>Paris;</HI> but the&s;e mu&s;t all break, when|&s;oever the King had a mind they &s;hould: So it plainly appeared, all was intended only to divide the Allies, by this Offer of a Par|tition, to which the <HI>States</HI> con&s;ented; and at which, the <HI>French</HI> hoped the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> would have been provoked again&s;t them. The <HI>French</HI> asked an A&s;&s;urance of the Deputies, that no other Articles &s;hould be in&s;i&s;ted on, but tho&s;e in the Prelimina|ries; this the Deputies po&s;itively refu&s;ed; for they had, by one of the Preliminaries, re&s;erved a Power to all the Allies to make farther Demands, when a general Treaty &s;hould be opened; they &s;aid, they them&s;elves would demand no more, but they could not limit the re&s;t, from their ju&s;t Demands.

Artifice, to provoke the Empire, and the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> as if the <HI>States</HI> intended to force them to accept of &s;uch a Peace, as they &s;hould pre&s;cribe: In another Conference, the <HI>States</HI> rejected the Offer of a Sum of Money, for carrying on the War in <HI>Spain,</HI> and therefore demanded, that the <HI>French</HI> would explain them&s;elves upon the Subject of evacuating <HI>Spain</HI> and the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> in favour of King <HI>Charles,</HI> before they could declare their Intentions, with relation to the Partition; and added, that all further Conferences would be to no purpo&s;e, till that was done.</P>

<P>The Queen's Intentions to make a change in her Mini&s;try now <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Change of the Mi|ni&s;try in <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> began to break out; in <HI>June</HI> &s;he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the Earl of <HI>Sunderland</HI> from being Secretary of State, without pretending any Male|ver&s;ation in him, and gave the Seals to the Lord <HI>Dartmouth.</HI> This gave the Alarm, both at home and abroad; but the Queen, to le&s;&s;en that, &s;aid to her Subjects here, in particular to the Governours of the Bank of <HI>England,</HI> and wrote to her Mini&s;ters abroad, that they &s;hould a&s;&s;ure her Allies, that &s;he would make no other Changes; and &s;aid this her&s;elf to the Mini&s;ter, whom the <HI>States</HI> had here: All the&s;e concurred to expre&s;s their Joy in this Re&s;olution, and joined to it their Advice, that &s;he would not di&s;&s;olve the Parlia|ment. This was repre&s;ented by tho&s;e, who had never been ver&s;ed in the Negotiations of Princes in an Alliance, as a bold in|truding into the Queen's Councils; tho' nothing is more common than for Princes to offer mutual Advices, in &s;uch Ca&s;es. Two Months after the change of the Secretary of State, the Queen di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed the Earl of <HI>Godolphin,</HI> from being Lord Trea&s;urer, and put the Trea&s;ury in Commi&s;&s;ion: Lord <HI>Powlet</HI> was the fir&s;t in
<PB N="553" REF="579">
form, but Mr. <HI>Harley</HI> was the Per&s;on, with whom the Secret was lodged; and it was vi&s;ible, he was the Chief Mini&s;ter: and now it appeared, that a total Change of the Mini&s;try, and the Di&s;&s;olution of the Parliament, were re&s;olved on.</P>
<P>In the mean while <HI>Sacheverel,</HI> being pre&s;ented to a Benefice in <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sacheverel'<HI>s Progre&s;s to</HI> Wales.</NOTE> <HI>North Wales,</HI> went down to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it; as he pa&s;&s;ed thro' the Counties, both going and coming, he was received and followed by &s;uch Numbers, and entertained with &s;uch Magnifi|cence, that our Princes in their Progre&s;&s;es have not been more run after, than he was: Great Fury and Violence appeared, on many occa&s;ions, tho' care was taken to give his Followers no &s;ort of Provocation; he was looked on as the Champion of the Church; and he &s;hewed as much In&s;olence on that occa&s;ion, as his Party did Folly. No notice was taken, by the Government, of all the&s;e Riots; they were rather favoured and encouraged than check'd; all this was like a Prelude to a greater Scene, that was to be acted at Court. The Queen came in <HI>October</HI> to Council, and called for a Proclamation, di&s;&s;olving the Parliament, which <HI>Harcourt</HI> (now made Attorney-General in the room of <HI>Montague,</HI> who had quitted that Po&s;t) had prepared: when it was read, the Lord Chancellor offered to &s;peak; but the Queen ro&s;e up, and would admit of no Debate, and ordered the Writs for a new Parliament to be pre|pared. At that time &s;he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the Lord <HI>Somers,</HI> and in his room made the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> Lord Pre&s;ident of the Council: She &s;ent to the Duke of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> for the Lord Steward's Staff, and gave it to the Duke of <HI>Buckingham;</HI> Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI> was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from being Secretary of State, and Mr. <HI>St. John</HI> had the Seals: The Earl of <HI>Derby</HI> was removed from being Chancellor of the Dutchy of <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> and was &s;ucceeded by the Lord <HI>Berkeley.</HI> The Lord Chancellor came, upon all the&s;e Removes, and delivered up the Great Seal; the Queen did not look for this, and was &s;ur|prized at it; and not knowing how to di&s;po&s;e of it, &s;he, with an unu&s;ual Earne&s;tne&s;s, pre&s;&s;ed him to keep it one day longer; and the day following, &s;he having con&s;idered the Matter with her Fa|vourites Mrs. <HI>Ma&s;&s;am</HI> and Mr. <HI>Harley,</HI> received it very readily; and it was &s;oon given to Sir <HI>Simon Harcourt.</HI> The Earl of <HI>Whar|ton</HI> delivered up his Commi&s;&s;ion of Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland;</HI> and that was given to the Duke of <HI>Ormond:</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Or|ford,</HI> with &s;ome of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Admiralty, with|drew from that Board, in who&s;e room others were put. So &s;ud|den, and &s;o entire a Change of the Mini&s;try, is &s;carce to be found in our Hi&s;tory, e&s;pecially where Men of great Abilities had &s;erved, both with Zeal and Succe&s;s, in&s;omuch, that the Admini&s;tration of all Affairs, at home and abroad, in their hands, was not only
<PB N="554" REF="580">
without exception, but had rai&s;ed the Admiration of all <HI>Europe.</HI> All this ro&s;e purely from the great Credit of the new Favourites, and the Queen's per&s;onal Di&s;ta&s;te to the old ones. The Queen was much delighted with all the&s;e Changes, and &s;eemed to think &s;he was freed from the Chains the old Mini&s;try held her in: She &s;poke of it to &s;everal Per&s;ons as a Captivity, &s;he had been long under. The Duke of <HI>Somer&s;et</HI> had very much alienated the Queen from the old Mini&s;try, and had no &s;mall &s;hare in their Di&s;grace; but he was &s;o di&s;plea&s;ed with the Di&s;&s;olution of the Parliament, and the new Model of the Mini&s;try, that, tho' he continued &s;ome time Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, he refu&s;ed to &s;it any more in Council, and complained openly of the Artifices, had been u&s;ed, to make him in&s;trumental to other People's De&s;igns, which he did among others to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>The next, and indeed the greate&s;t Care of the new Mini&s;try <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Elec|tions of Par|liament-Men.</NOTE> was, the managing the Elections to Parliament. Unheard-of Methods were u&s;ed to &s;ecure them; in <HI>London,</HI> and in all the Parts of <HI>England,</HI> but more remarkably in the great Cities, there was a va&s;t Concour&s;e of rude Multitudes brought together, who be|haved them&s;elves in &s;o boi&s;terous a manner, that it was not &s;afe, and in many places not po&s;&s;ible, for tho&s;e who had a Right to vote, to come and give their Votes for a Whig; open Violence was u&s;ed in &s;everal Parts: this was &s;o general, thro' the whole Kingdom, all at the &s;ame time, that it was vi&s;ible the thing had been for &s;ome time concerted, and the proper Methods and Tools had been prepared for it. The Clergy had a great &s;hare in this; for be&s;ides a Cour&s;e, for &s;ome Months, of inflaming Sermons, they went about from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e, pre&s;&s;ing their People to &s;hew, on this great occa&s;ion, their Zeal for the Church, and now or never to &s;ave it: They al&s;o told them, in what ill hands the Queen had been kept, as in Captivity, and that it was a Charity, as well as their Duty, to free her from the Power the late Mini|&s;try exerci&s;ed over her.</P>
<P>While the Poll was taken in <HI>London,</HI> a new Commi&s;&s;ion for the Lieutenancy of the City was &s;ent in; by which a great Change was made; Tories were put in, and Whigs were left out; in a word, the Practice and Violence u&s;ed now in Elections, went far beyond any thing, that I had ever known in <HI>England:</HI> And by &s;uch means, above three Parts in four of the Members returned to Parliament, may at any time be packed: And, if free Elections are nece&s;&s;ary to the Being of a Parliament, there was great rea&s;on to doubt, if this was a true Repre&s;entative duly elected.</P>
<P><PB N="555" REF="581">
The Bank was the Body, to which the Government of late had recour&s;e, and was always readily furni&s;hed by it; but their Credit was now &s;o &s;unk, that they could not do as they had <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Sinking of Credit.</NOTE> done formerly; Actions, that &s;ome Months before were at 130, &s;unk now &s;o low as to 95, and did not ri&s;e above 101 or 102, all the following Winter. The new Mini&s;ters gave it out, that they would act moderately at home, and &s;teadily abroad, main|tain our Alliances, and carry on the War. But before I enter on the Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, I will give an account of Affairs abroad.</P>
<P>King <HI>Philip</HI> went to <HI>Arragon</HI> to his Army, and gave it out, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in <HI>Spain.</HI></NOTE> that he was re&s;olved to put all to the Deci&s;ion of a Battle with King <HI>Charles,</HI> who was likewi&s;e come to head his Army; they lay &s;o near one another, that King <HI>Philip</HI> cannonaded the Camp of his Enemies, but his Men were beat off with lo&s;s, and drew away to a greater di&s;tance; however, before the end of <HI>July,</HI> there was an Action of great Importance near <HI>Almanara:</HI> The main Body of King <HI>Philip</HI>'s Hor&s;e de&s;igned to cut off a Part of King <HI>Charles</HI>'s Foot, that was &s;eparated from the Cavalry, commanded by <HI>Stanhope:</HI> He drew his whole Body together; and tho' he was much inferiour in number, yet he &s;ent to King <HI>Charles</HI> for Orders, to engage the Enemy. It was not without &s;ome dif|ficulty, and after &s;ome re-iterated pre&s;&s;ing In&s;tances, that he got leave to fall on.</P>
<P>As the two Bodies were advancing one again&s;t another, <HI>Stan|hope</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Battle of <HI>A$span$|nara.</HI></NOTE> rode at the head of his Body, and the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> General ad|vanced at the head of his Troops: The two Generals began the Action; in which, very happily for <HI>Stanhope,</HI> he killed the <HI>Spa|niard:</HI> And his Men, animated with the Example and Succe&s;s of their General, fell on and broke the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Hor&s;e &s;o entirely, that King <HI>Philip</HI> lo&s;t the be&s;t part of his Cavalry in that Action; upon which, he retired towards <HI>Saragoza;</HI> but was clo&s;ely fol|lowed by King <HI>Charles:</HI> And on the 20th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> they came to a total Engagement, which ended in an entire Defeat: And by this means <HI>Arragon</HI> was again in King <HI>Charles</HI>'s hands. King <HI>Philip</HI> got off with a very &s;mall Body to <HI>Madrid.</HI> But he &s;oon left it, and retired with all the Tribunals following him to <HI>Validolid;</HI> and &s;ent his Queen and Son to <HI>Victoria.</HI> Some of his Troops got off in &s;mall Bodies; and the&s;e were, in a little time brought together, to the number of about 10000 Men; the Troops, that they had on the Frontier of <HI>Portugal,</HI> were brought to join them, with which they &s;oon made up the Face of an Army.</P>

King <HI>Charles</HI> made all the ha&s;te he could to <HI>Madrid,</HI> but found none of the Grandees there; and it appeared, that the <HI>Ca&s;tilians</HI> were firmly united to King <HI>Philip,</HI> and re&s;olved to adhere to him, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>K.</HI> Charles <HI>at</HI> Madrid.</NOTE> at all hazards. The King of <HI>France</HI> now &s;hewed, he was re&s;olved to maintain his Grand&s;on, &s;ince if he had ever intended to do it, it was now very ea&s;y to oblige him to evacuate <HI>Spain.</HI> On the con|trary, he &s;ent the Duke of <HI>Vendome,</HI> to command the Army there; and he ordered &s;ome Troops to march into <HI>Catalonia,</HI> to force King <HI>Charles</HI> to come back, and &s;ecure that Principality. King <HI>Charles</HI> continued till the beginning of <HI>December</HI> in <HI>Ca&s;tile.</HI> In all that time, no care was taken by the Allies, to &s;upply or &s;up|port him: We were &s;o engaged in our Party-Matters at home, that we &s;eemed to take no thought of things abroad, and without us no|thing could be done: The Court of <HI>Vienna</HI> was &s;o apprehen&s;ive of the Danger from a War, like to break out, between the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> and the <HI>Czar,</HI> that they would not dimini&s;h their Army in <HI>Hungary.</HI> After King <HI>Charles</HI> left his Army, <HI>Starembergh</HI> &s;eemed re&s;olved to take his Winter Quarters in <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> and made a &s;hew of fortifying <HI>Toledo;</HI> but for want of Provi&s;ion, and chiefly for fear that his Retreat to <HI>Arragon</HI> might be cut off, he re&s;olved to march back to the <HI>Ebro:</HI> King <HI>Philip</HI> marched after him. <HI>Sta|rembergh</HI> left <HI>Stanhope</HI> &s;ome Hours March behind him, and he took up his Quarters in an unfortified Village, called <HI>Brihuega:</HI> But finding King <HI>Philip</HI> was near him, he &s;ent his <HI>Aid de Camp</HI> to let <HI>Starembergh</HI> know his Danger, and to de&s;ire his A&s;&s;i&s;tance. <HI>Starembergh</HI> might have come in time to have &s;aved him; but he moved &s;o &s;lowly, that it was conjectured, he envied the Glory <HI>Stanhope</HI> had got, and was not &s;orry to &s;ee it eclip&s;ed; and there|fore made not that ha&s;te, he might and ought to have done.</P>
<P><HI>Stanhope</HI> and his Men ca&s;t up Entrenchments, and defended the&s;e <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Battle of <HI>Villa V$|c$o&s;a.</HI></NOTE> very bravely, as long as their Powder la&s;ted; but in conlu&s;ion they were forced to &s;urrender them&s;elves Pri&s;oners of War: Some Hours after that, <HI>Starembergh</HI> came up; and tho' the Enemy were more than double his number, yet he attack'd them with &s;uch Succe&s;s, that he defeated them quite, killed 7000 of their Men, took their Cannon and Baggage, and &s;taid a whole Day in the Field of Battle. The Enemy drew back; but <HI>Starembergh</HI> had &s;uffered &s;o much in the Action, that he was not in a condi|tion to pur&s;ue them; nor could he carry off their Cannon for want of Hor&s;es; but he nailed them up, and by &s;low Marches got to <HI>Saragoza,</HI> the Enemy not thinking it convenient to give him any Di&s;turbance. As he did not judge it &s;afe, to &s;tay long in <HI>Ar|ragon,</HI> &s;o, in the beginning of <HI>January,</HI> he marched into <HI>Catalo|nia;</HI> but his Army had &s;uffered &s;o much, both in the la&s;t Action

<P>The <HI>Czar</HI> carried on the War in <HI>Livonia</HI> with &s;uch Succe&s;s, <NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ in the No$$h</NOTE> that he took both <HI>Riga</HI> and <HI>Revel;</HI> and to add to the Mi&s;eries of <HI>Sweden,</HI> a great Plague &s;wept away many of their People. <HI>Sweden</HI> it&s;elf was left expo&s;ed to the <HI>Danes</HI> and the <HI>Czar;</HI> but their Do|minions in <HI>Germany</HI> were &s;ecured by the Guaranty of the Allies: Yet, tho' the Government of <HI>Sweden</HI> did accept of this provi&s;io|nally, till the King's Plea&s;ure &s;hould be known, it was not with|out difficulty, that he was prevailed on to give way to it.</P>
<P>I come now to give an Account of the Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Th$ $word$ Parliament opened</NOTE> which was opened the 25th of <HI>November:</HI> The Queen, in her Speech, took no notice of the Succe&s;&s;es of this Campaign, as &s;he had always done in her former Speeches; and in&s;tead of promi&s;ing

to maintain the Toleration, &s;he &s;aid &s;he would maintain the In|dulgence granted by Law to &s;crupulous Con&s;ciences; this change of Phra&s;e into <HI>Sacheverel</HI>'s Language was much ob&s;erved. The Lords made an Addre&s;s of an odd Compo&s;ition to her; which &s;hewed it was not drawn by tho&s;e, who had penned their former Addre&s;&s;es: In&s;tead of promi&s;ing, that they would do all that was po&s;&s;ible, they only promi&s;ed to do all that was rea&s;onable, which &s;eemed to import a Limitation, as if they had apprehended, that unrea&s;onable things might be asked of them: And the Conclu&s;ion was in a very cold &s;train of Rhetorick; they ended with &s;aying, <HI>They had no more to add.</HI> The Commons were more hearty in their Addre&s;s; and in the end of it, they reflected on &s;ome late Practices again&s;t the Church and State. <HI>Bromley</HI> was cho&s;en Speaker without any Oppo&s;ition; there were few Whigs returned, again&s;t whom Petitions were not offered; there were in all about an Hundred; and by the fir&s;t &s;teps, the Majority made it appear, that they intended to clear the Hou&s;e of all, who were &s;u&s;pected to be Whigs. They pa&s;&s;ed the Bill for four Shillings in the Pound, before the &s;hort Rece&s;s at <HI>Chri&s;tmas.</HI></P>
<P>During that time, the News came of the ill Succe&s;s in <HI>Spain;</HI> and this giving a handle to examine into that part of our Conduct, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1711. The Con|duct in <HI>Spain</HI> cen&s;ured by the Lords.</NOTE> the Queen was advi&s;ed to lay hold on it; &s;o, without &s;taying till &s;he heard from her own Mini&s;ters or her Allies, as was u&s;ual, &s;he laid the Matter before the Parliament, as the publick News brought it from <HI>Paris;</HI> which was afterwards found to be fal&s;e in many Particulars; and told them, what Orders &s;he had given upon it, of which &s;he hoped they would approve. This was a mean Expre&s;&s;ion from the Sovereign, not u&s;ed in former Me&s;&s;ages; and &s;eemed to be below the Dignity of the Crown. She ordered &s;ome Regiments to be carried over to <HI>Spain,</HI> and named the Earl of <HI>Peterborough,</HI> to go to the Court of <HI>Vienna,</HI> to pre&s;s them to join in the mo&s;t effectual mea&s;ures, for &s;upporting King <HI>Charles</HI> there. The Lords, in their An&s;wer to this Me&s;&s;age, promi&s;ed that they would examine into the Conduct of the War in <HI>Spain,</HI> to &s;ee if there had been any Mi&s;management, in any part of it: And they entred immediately into that Enquiry. They began it with an Addre&s;s to the Queen, to delay the Di&s;patch of the Earl of <HI>Peterborough,</HI> till the Hou&s;e might receive from him &s;uch In|formations of the Affairs of <HI>Spain,</HI> as he could give them. This was readily granted, and he gave the Hou&s;e a long Re|cital of the Affairs of <HI>Spain,</HI> loading the Earl of <HI>Gallway</HI> with all the Mi&s;carriages in that War. And in particular he &s;aid, that in a Council of War in <HI>Valencia,</HI> in the middle of <HI>January</HI>
<PB N="559" REF="585">
1706-7, the Earl of <HI>Gallway</HI> had pre&s;&s;ed the pu&s;hing an offen&s;ive War for that Year; and that the Lord <HI>Tyrawly</HI> and <HI>Stanhope</HI> had concurred with him in that: Whereas he him&s;elf was for lying on a defen&s;ive War for that Year in <HI>Spain:</HI> He &s;aid, this Re&s;olution was carried by tho&s;e three, again&s;t the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s own Mind; and he imputed all the Misfortunes that followed in <HI>Spain,</HI> to this Re&s;olution &s;o taken. <HI>Stanhope</HI> had given an Ac|count of the Debates in that Council to the Queen; and the Earl of <HI>Sunderland,</HI> in an&s;wer to his Letter, had wrote by the Queen's Order, that &s;he approved of their pre&s;&s;ing for an offen&s;ive War; and they were ordered to per&s;i&s;t in that. The Earl of <HI>Sun|derland</HI> &s;aid, in that Letter, that the Queen took notice, that they three (meaning the Earl of <HI>Gallway,</HI> Lord <HI>Tyrawly,</HI> and <HI>Stanhope)</HI> were the only Per&s;ons that were for acting offen&s;ively: And that little regard was to be had to the Earl of <HI>Peterborough</HI>'s Oppo&s;i|tion. Upon the Strength of this Letter the Earl of <HI>Peterborough</HI> affirmed, that the whole Council of War was again&s;t an offen&s;ive War: He laid the blame, not only of the Battle of <HI>Almanza,</HI> and all that followed in <HI>Spain,</HI> upon tho&s;e Re&s;olutions, but likewi&s;e the Mi&s;carriage of the De&s;ign on <HI>Toulon;</HI> for he told them of a great De&s;ign, he had concerted with the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> and of the u&s;e that might have been made of &s;ome of the Troops in <HI>Spain,</HI> if a defen&s;ive War had been agreed to there. The Earl of <HI>Gallway</HI> and the Lord <HI>Tyrawly</HI> were &s;ent for; and they were asked an Ac|count of that Council at <HI>Valencia:</HI> They &s;aid, there were many Councils held there about that time; and that both the <HI>Portu|gueze</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador and General, and the Envoy of the <HI>States</HI> agreed with them in their Opinions, for an offen&s;ive War; and they named &s;ome <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that were of the &s;ame mind: They al&s;o &s;aid, that all along, even to the Battle of <HI>Almanza,</HI> in all their Re&s;olutions, the Majority of the Council of War voted for every thing that was done, and that they were directed to per&s;i&s;t in their Opinions, by Letters wrote to them, in the Queen's Name, by the Secretaries of State: That as to the Words, in the Earl of <HI>Sunderland</HI>'s Letter, that &s;poke of them, as the only Per&s;ons that were of that Opinion; the&s;e were under&s;tood by them, as belong|ing only to the Queen's Subjects, and that they related more im|mediately to the Earl of <HI>Peterborough,</HI> who oppo&s;ed that Re&s;olu|tion, but not to the re&s;t of the Council of War; for the Majority of them was of their mind.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Gallway</HI> gave in two Papers; the one related to his own Conduct in <HI>Spain;</HI> the other was an An&s;wer to the Relation given in writing by the Earl of <HI>Peterborough.</HI> The Hou&s;e of Lords was &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, that the Majority believed every thing that was

&s;aid by the Earl of <HI>Peterborough;</HI> and it was carried, that his Ac|count was honourable, faithful, and ju&s;t; and that all the Misfor|tunes in <HI>Spain</HI> were the Effect and Con&s;equence of tho&s;e Re&s;olu|tions, taken in the middle of <HI>January.</HI></P>
<P>From this Cen&s;ure on the Earl of <HI>Gallway,</HI> the Debate was car|ried to that, which was chiefly aimed at, to put a Cen&s;ure on the Mini&s;try here. So it was moved, that an Addre&s;s &s;hould be made to the Queen, to free tho&s;e, who were under an Oath of Secrecy, from that Tie, that a full Account might be laid before the Hou&s;e, of all their Con&s;ultations: The Queen granted this readily; and came to the Hou&s;e, which was under&s;tood to be on de&s;ign to favour that, which was aimed at. Upon this the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> the Earls of <HI>Godolphin</HI> and <HI>Sunderland,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Cowper</HI> &s;hewed that, con&s;idering the Force &s;ent over to <HI>Spain</HI> under the Lord <HI>Rivers,</HI> they thought an offen&s;ive War was ad|vi&s;eable; that the Expence of that War was &s;o great, and the Pro&s;pect was &s;o promi&s;ing, that they could not but think an offen|&s;ive War nece&s;&s;ary; and that to advi&s;e a defen&s;ive one, would have made them liable to a ju&s;t Cen&s;ure, as de&s;igning to protract the War. The De&s;ign on <HI>Toulon</HI> was no way intermix'd with the Affairs of <HI>Spain;</HI> the Earl of <HI>Peterborough</HI> fancied he was in that Secret, and had indeed propo&s;ed the bringing over &s;ome Troops from <HI>Spain</HI> on that De&s;ign, and had offered a Scheme to the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> in which that was mentioned, and had &s;ent that over to <HI>England.</HI> But tho' the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> &s;uffered that Lord to amu&s;e him&s;elf, with his own Project, which he had concerted for the Attempt on <HI>Toulon;</HI> that Duke had declared he would not undertake it, if it was not managed with the utmo&s;t Secrecy, which was &s;acredly kept, and communicated only to tho&s;e, to whom it mu&s;t be tru&s;ted for the Execution of it. No Troops from <HI>Spain</HI> were to be imployed in that Service, nor did it mi&s;carry for want of Men. The&s;e Lords farther &s;aid, they gave their Opinions in Council, according to the be&s;t of their Judgment; their Inten|tions were very &s;incere, for the Service of the Queen, and to bring the War to a &s;peedy Conclu&s;ion. Yet a Vote pa&s;s'd, that they were to blame for advi&s;ing an offen&s;ive War in <HI>Spain,</HI> upon which the lo&s;s of the Battle of <HI>Almanza</HI> followed; and that this occa&s;ioned the mi&s;carrying of the De&s;ign upon <HI>Toulon.</HI></P>
<P>Here was a new and &s;trange Precedent, of cen&s;uring a Re&s;olu|tion taken in Council; and of de&s;iring the Queen to order all, that <NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$ made $word$</NOTE> had pa&s;s'd in Council, to be laid before the Hou&s;e: In all the hot Debates in King <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t's Reign, in which many Re&s;o|lutions taken in Council were ju&s;tly cen&s;urable, yet the pa&s;&s;ing any Cen&s;ure on them was never attempted by Men, who were no way
<PB N="561" REF="589">
partial in favour of the Prerogative: But they under&s;tood well what our Con&s;titution was in that point: A Re&s;olution in Council is only the Sovereign's Act, who, upon hearing his Coun&s;ellors de|liver their Opinions, forms his own Re&s;olution: A Coun&s;ellor may indeed be liable to Cen&s;ure, for what he may &s;ay at that Board; but the Re&s;olution taken there has been hitherto treated with a &s;ilent Re&s;pect: but by this Precedent, it will be hereafter &s;ubject to a Parliamentary Enquiry. The Queen was &s;o de&s;irous to have a Cen&s;ure fix'd on her former Mini&s;try, that &s;he did not enough con&s;ider the Wound given to the Prerogative, by the way in which it was done.</P>
<P>After this was over; another Enquiry was made into the Force we had in <HI>Spain,</HI> at the time of the Battle of <HI>Almanza;</HI> and it was found not to exceed 14000 Men, tho' the Parliament had voted 29000 for the War in <HI>Spain.</HI> This &s;eemed to be a crying thing; tragical Declamations were made upon it: But in truth that Vote had pa&s;s'd here only in the <HI>January</HI> before the Battle of <HI>Almanza,</HI> which was fought on the 14th of <HI>April.</HI> Now it was not po&s;&s;ible to levy and tran&s;port Men in &s;o &s;hort a time: It was made appear, that all the Money, given by the Parliament for that Service, was i&s;&s;ued out and applied to it, and that extraordinary Deligence was u&s;ed, both in forwarding the Levies and in their Tran&s;portation: They were &s;ent from <HI>Ireland,</HI> the Pa&s;&s;age from thence being both &s;afe&s;t and quicke&s;t. All this, and a great deal more to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, was &s;aid: But it &s;ignified nothing; for when Re&s;olutions are taken up beforehand, the Debating con|cerning them is only a piece of Form u&s;ed to come at the Que&s;|tion with &s;ome Decency: And there was &s;o little of that ob&s;erved at this time, that the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> &s;aid in plain Words, that they had the Majority, and would make u&s;e of it, as he had ob&s;erved done by others, when they had it on their &s;ide. So, tho' no Examination had been made, but into that &s;ingle point of the Numbers at <HI>Almanza,</HI> they came to a gene|ral Vote, That the late Mini&s;try had been negligent, in the Ma|nagement of the War in <HI>Spain,</HI> to the great prejudice of the Na|tion; and they then ordered all their Proceedings and Votes to be put in an Addre&s;s, and laid before the Queen: And tho' they had made no Enquiry into the Expence of that War, nor into the Application of the Money, given by the Parliament for it, yet in their Addre&s;s they mentioned the great Profu&s;ion of Money in that Service. This they thought would touch the Nation very &s;en&s;ibly; and they hoped the thing would be ea&s;ily believed on their Word. Prote&s;ts were made again&s;t every Vote, in the whole
<PB N="562" REF="590">
Progre&s;s of this Matter: Some of the&s;e carried &s;uch Reflections, on the Votes of the Hou&s;e, that they were expunged.</P>
<P>I never &s;aw any thing carried on, in the Hou&s;e of Lords, &s;o <NOTE PLACE="marg">A &s;trange way of Pro|ceeding.</NOTE> little to their Honour as this was; &s;ome, who voted with the re&s;t, &s;eemed a&s;hamed of it: They &s;aid, &s;omewhat was to be done, to ju&s;tify the Queen's change of the Mini&s;try; and every thing el&s;e|where had been &s;o well conducted, as to be above all Cen|&s;ure: So the Misfortune of <HI>Almanza,</HI> being a vi&s;ible thing, they re&s;olved to lay the Load there. The Management of the publick Trea&s;ure was exact and unexceptionable: &s;o that the &s;ingle Mi&s;|fortune of the whole War was to be magnified; &s;ome were more ea&s;ily drawn to concur in the&s;e Votes, becau&s;e by the Act of Grace, all tho&s;e, who had been concerned in the Admini&s;tration, were covered from Pro&s;ecution and Puni&s;hment: So this was repre|&s;ented to &s;ome, as a Compliment that would be very acceptable to the Queen, and by which no Per&s;on could be hurt. They loaded &s;ingly the Earl of <HI>Gallway,</HI> with the lo&s;s of the Battle of <HI>Almanza,</HI> tho' it was re&s;olved on in a Council of War, and he had behaved him&s;elf in it, with all the Bravery and Conduct that could be ex|pected from a great General, and had made a good Retreat, and &s;ecured <HI>Catalonia</HI> with unexpre&s;&s;ible Diligence. They al&s;o cen|&s;ured him for not in&s;i&s;ting on the Point of Honour, in the Prece|dence to be given to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Troops, as &s;oon as the <HI>Portugueze</HI> Army entered into <HI>Spain:</HI> But, by our Treaty with that Crown, the Army was to be commanded by a <HI>Portugueze</HI> General; &s;o it was not in his power to change the Order of the Army: If he had made the lea&s;t Struggle about it, the <HI>Portugueze,</HI> who were not ea&s;ily prevailed on to enter into <HI>Spain,</HI> would have gladly enough laid hold of any occa&s;ion, which &s;uch a Di&s;pute would have gi|ven them, and have turned back upon it: And &s;o by his in&s;i&s;ting on &s;uch a Punctilio, the whole De&s;ign would have been lo&s;t. We had likewi&s;e, in our Treaty with them, yielded expre&s;&s;ly the Point of the Flag in tho&s;e Seas, for which alone, on other occa|&s;ions, we have engaged in Wars; &s;o he had no rea&s;on to conte&s;t a le&s;&s;er point: Yet a Cen&s;ure was likewi&s;e laid on this. And this was the conclu&s;ion of the Enquiries, made by the Hou&s;e of Lords this Se&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Harley,</HI> in the Hou&s;e of Commons, led them to enquire into <NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ $word$ &s;ured in the Hou&s;e of Common.</NOTE> &s;ome Abu&s;es in the Victualling the Navy: They had been pub|lickly practi&s;ed for many Years, &s;ome have &s;aid ever &s;ince the Re&s;toration: The Abu&s;e was vi&s;ible, but connived at, that &s;eve|ral Expences might be an&s;wered that way: Some have &s;aid, that the Captains Tables were kept out of the Gain made in it. Yet a Member of the Hou&s;e, who was a Whig, was complained of
<PB N="563" REF="591">
for this, and expelled the Hou&s;e; and a Pro&s;ecution was ordered again&s;t him: But the Abu&s;e goes on &s;till, as avowedly as ever; here was a &s;hew of Zeal, and a &s;eeming Di&s;covery of fraudulent Practices, by which the Nation was deceived.</P>
<P>The Money did not come into the Trea&s;ury &s;o readily as for|merly, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Supplies gi|ven for the War.</NOTE> neither upon the Act of four Shillings in the Pound, nor on the Duty laid on Malt: So, to rai&s;e a quick Supply, there were two Bills pa&s;s'd, for rai&s;ing three Millions and a half by two Lotteries, the fir&s;t of <HI>1,500,000l.</HI> and the &s;econd of two Mil|lions, to be paid back in thirty-two Years; and for a Fund, to an&s;wer this, Duties were laid on Hops, Candles, Leather, Cards and Dice, and on the Po&s;tage on Letters. In one Branch of this, the Hou&s;e of Commons &s;eemed to break in upon a Rule, that had hitherto pa&s;&s;ed for a &s;acred one. When the Duty upon Lea|ther was fir&s;t propo&s;ed, it was rejected by a Majority, and &s;o, by their u&s;ual Orders, it was not to be offered again, during that Se&s;&s;ion: But after a little Practice upon &s;ome Members, the &s;ame Duty was propo&s;ed, with this Variation, that Skins and Tanned Hides &s;hould be &s;o charged; this was Leather in another Name. The Lotteries were &s;oon filled up; &s;o, by this means, Money came into the Trea&s;ury: and indeed this Method has never yet failed of rai&s;ing a &s;peedy Supply. There was no more asked, tho' in the beginning of this Se&s;&s;ion, the Hou&s;e had voted a Mil|lion more, than the&s;e Bills amounted to; which made &s;ome con|clude, there was a &s;ecret Negotiation and Pro&s;pect of a Peace.</P>
<P>As the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> was involved in the general Cen|&s;ure <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of $word$ $span$.</NOTE> pa&s;&s;ed on the former Mini&s;try, &s;o he had not the u&s;ual Com|pliment of Thanks for the Succe&s;&s;es of the former Campaign: When that was moved in the Hou&s;e of Lords, it was oppo&s;ed with &s;uch Eagerne&s;s by the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> and others, that it was let fall: For this the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> was prepared by the Queen; who, upon his coming over, told him that he was not to expect the Thanks of the two Hou&s;es, as had been formerly: She added, that &s;he expected he &s;hould live well with her Mi|ni&s;ters, but did not think fit to &s;ay any thing of the Rea&s;ons &s;he had, for making tho&s;e Changes in her Mini&s;try. Yet he &s;hewed no Re&s;entments, for all the ill U&s;age he met with; and, ha|ving been much pre&s;&s;ed by the <HI>States</HI> and our other Allies, to continue in the Command of the Army, he told me, upon that account, he re&s;olved to be patient, and to &s;ubmit to every thing, in order to the carrying on the War; and finding the Queen's Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion again&s;t his Dutche&s;s was not to be overcome, he carried a Surrender of all her Places to the Queen: She was Groom of the Stole, had the Robes, and the Privy Pur&s;e; in all which,
<PB N="564" REF="592">
&s;he had &s;erved with great Occonomy and Fidelity to the Queen, and Ju&s;tice to tho&s;e, who dealt with the Crown. The Dutche&s;s of <HI>Somer&s;et</HI> had the two fir&s;t of the&s;e Employments, and Mrs. <HI>Ma&s;&s;am</HI> had the la&s;t.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of Commons found the Encouragement given the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Complaints upon the Fa|vour &s;hewed the <HI>Pala|tines.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Palatines,</HI> was &s;o di&s;plea&s;ing to the People, that they ordered a Committee to examine into that Matter. The Truth of this Story was, that in the Year 1708, about fifty <HI>Palatines,</HI> who were <HI>Lutherans,</HI> and were ruined, came over to <HI>England:</HI> The&s;e were &s;o effectually recommended to Prince <HI>George</HI>'s Chaplains, that the Queen allowed them a Shilling a-day, and took care to have them tran&s;ported to the Plantations: They, ravi&s;hed with this good Reception, wrote over &s;uch an Account of it, as oc|ca&s;ioned a general Di&s;po&s;ition among all the Poor of that Coun|try to come over, in &s;earch of better Fortunes: And &s;ome of our Merchants, who were concerned in the Plantations, and knew the Advantage of bringing over great numbers to people tho&s;e de&s;art Countries, encouraged them with the Promi&s;es of Lands and Settlements there. This being printed, and &s;pread thro' tho&s;e Parts, they came to <HI>Holland</HI> in great Bodies: The Anabap|ti&s;ts there were particularly helpful to them, both in &s;ub&s;i&s;ting tho&s;e in <HI>Holland,</HI> and in tran&s;porting them to <HI>England.</HI> Upon their coming over, the Queen relieved them at fir&s;t; and great Charities were &s;ent to &s;upport them: All the Tories de|clared again&s;t the good Reception that was given them, as much as the Whigs approved of it. It happened at a bad Sea&s;on, for Bread was then &s;old at double the ordinary Price; &s;o the Poor complained, that &s;uch Charities went to &s;upport Strangers, when they needed them &s;o much: The time of our Fleet's &s;ailing to the Plantations was likewi&s;e at a great di&s;tance. The <HI>Palatines</HI> ex|pected to be all kept together in a Colony, and became very un|ea&s;y, when they &s;aw that could not be compa&s;&s;ed: Some of them were both unactive and mutinous; and this heightened the Out|cry again&s;t them: Some Papi&s;ts mixed among them, and came over with them; but they were pre&s;ently &s;ent back. Great num|bers were &s;ent to <HI>Ireland;</HI> but mo&s;t of them to the Plantations in <HI>North America,</HI> where it is believed their Indu&s;try will quickly turn to a good account. The De&s;ign was now formed, to load the late Admini&s;tration all that was po&s;&s;ible; &s;o it was pretended, that in all that Affair, there was a De&s;ign again&s;t the Church, and to encrea&s;e the Numbers and Strength of the Di&s;&s;enters. It had indeed pa&s;&s;ed for an e&s;tabli&s;hed Maxim, in all Ages, and in all Governments, that the drawing of Numbers of People to any Nation, did increa&s;e its intrin&s;ick Strength; which is only to be
<PB N="565" REF="593">
mea&s;ur'd, by the Multitude of the People, that inhabit and cul|tivate it: Yet the Hou&s;e of Commons came to a &s;udden Vote, That tho&s;e who had encourag'd and brought over the <HI>Palatines,</HI> were Enemies to the Nation: And, becau&s;e a Letter, wrote by the Earl of <HI>Sunderland,</HI> in the Queen's Name, to the Council of Trade, was laid before them, by which they were order'd to con&s;ider of the be&s;t Methods of di&s;po&s;ing of them, it was moved to lay the Load of that Matter on him, in &s;ome &s;evere Votes: Yet this was put off for that time; and afterwards by &s;everal Adjourn|ments delay'd, till at la&s;t it was let fall.</P>
<P>But while the Heat, rai&s;ed by this Enquiry, was kept up; the <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Bill to re|peal the ge|neral Natu|ralization re|jected by the Lords.</NOTE> Commons pa&s;s'd a Bill to repeal the Act for a general Naturali|zation of all Prote&s;tants, which had pa&s;s'd two Years before; pre|tending that it gave the Encouragement to the <HI>Palatines</HI> to come over, tho' none of them had made u&s;e of that Act, in order to their Naturalization. This was &s;ent up to the Lords; and the Lord <HI>Guern&s;ey,</HI> and &s;ome others, entertained them with tragical Declamations on the Subject; yet, upon the fir&s;t reading of the Bill, it was rejected.

<P>Another Bill, for qualifying Members, by having 600 <HI>l.</HI> a-year <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Bill quali|fying Mem|bers to be cho&s;en pa&s;&s;ed.</NOTE> for a Knight of the Shire, and 300 <HI>l.</HI> a-year for a Burge&s;s, &s;uc|ceeded better: The De&s;ign of this was to exclude Courtiers, Mi|litary Men, and Merchants, from &s;itting in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, in hopes that this being &s;ettled, the Land Intere&s;t would be the prevailing Con&s;ideration, in all their Con&s;ultations. They did not extend the&s;e Qualifications to <HI>Scotland;</HI> it being pretended that E&s;tates there, being generally &s;mall, it would not be ea&s;y to find Men &s;o qualified, capable to &s;erve. This was thought to &s;trike at an e&s;&s;ential Part of our Con&s;titution, touching the Free|dom of Elections: And it had been, as oft as it was attempted, oppo&s;ed by the Mini&s;try, tho' it had a fair Appearance of &s;ecuring Liberty, when all was lodged with Men of E&s;tates: Yet our Gen|try was become &s;o ignorant, and &s;o corrupt, that many appre|hended the ill Effects of this; and that the Intere&s;t of Trade, which indeed &s;upports that of the Land, would neither be un|der&s;tood nor regarded. But the new Mini&s;ters re&s;olved to be po|pular with tho&s;e who promoted it; &s;o it pa&s;&s;ed, and was much magnified, as a main part of our Security for the future.</P>
<P>Another Bill pa&s;&s;ed, not much to the honour of tho&s;e who <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Act for <HI>French</HI> Wine</NOTE> promoted it, for the Importation of the <HI>French</HI> Wine: The In|tere&s;t of the Nation lay again&s;t this &s;o vi&s;ibly, that nothing but the delicate Palates of tho&s;e, who loved that Liquor, could have
<PB N="566" REF="594">
carried &s;uch a Motion thro' the two Hou&s;es. But, tho' the Bill pa&s;s'd, it was like to have no effect: For it was provided, that the Wine &s;hould be imported in neutral Ve&s;&s;els; and the King of <HI>France</HI> had forbid it to be exported, in any Ve&s;&s;els but his own: it &s;eems he reckoned, that our de&s;ire of drinking his Wine, would carry us to take it on &s;uch Terms, as he &s;hould pre&s;cribe. In the Hou&s;e of Commons there appeared a new Combination of To|ries, of the highe&s;t form, who thought the Court was yet in &s;ome Management with the Whigs, and did not come up to their heighth, which they imputed to Mr. <HI>Harley;</HI> &s;o they began to form them&s;elves in oppo&s;ition to him, and expre&s;&s;ed their Jealou&s;y of him on &s;everal occa&s;ions, &s;ometimes publickly. But an odd Accident, that had almo&s;t been fatal, proved happy to him; <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Attempt on <HI>Harley</HI> by <HI>Gui&s;card.</HI></NOTE> it fell out on the 8th of <HI>March,</HI> the Day of the Queen's Acce&s;&s;ion to the Crown: One <HI>Gui&s;card,</HI> who was an Abbot in <HI>France,</HI> had for &s;ome enormous Crimes made his e&s;cape out of that King|dom; he printed a formal Story of a De&s;ign he was laying, to rai&s;e a general In&s;urrection in the Southern Parts of <HI>France</HI> (in conjunction with tho&s;e, who were then up in the <HI>Cevennes)</HI> for recovering their ancient Liberties, as well as for re&s;toring the Edicts in favour of the <HI>Huguenots:</HI> And he &s;eemed very zea|lous for publick Liberty. He in&s;inuated him&s;elf &s;o into the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> that he recommended him to our Court, as a Man ca|pable of doing great Service: He &s;eemed forward to undertake any thing, that he might be put on; he had a Pen&s;ion a&s;&s;igned him for &s;ome Years, but it did not an&s;wer his Expence; &s;o when he was out of hope of getting it increa&s;ed, he wrote to one at the Court of <HI>France,</HI> to offer his Service there; and it was thought, he had a De&s;ign again&s;t the Queen's Per&s;on; for he had tried, by all the ways that he could contrive, to be admitted to &s;peak with her in private; which he had attempted that very Morning: but his Letter being opened at the Po&s;t-hou&s;e, and brought to the Cabinet Council, a Me&s;&s;enger was &s;ent from the Council, to &s;eize on him. He found him walking in <HI>St. James's</HI> Park; and having di&s;armed him, carried him to the Lords, who were then &s;itting: As he waited without, before he was called in, he took up a Penknife, which lay among Pens in a Standi&s;h; when he was que&s;tioned upon his Letter, he de&s;ired to &s;peak in private with Secretary <HI>St. John,</HI> who refu&s;ed it; and he being placed out of his reach, whereas <HI>Harley</HI> &s;ate near him, he &s;truck him in the Brea&s;t with the Penknife, again and again, till it broke; and indeed wounded him as much as could be done, with &s;o &s;mall a Tool. The other Coun&s;ellors drew their Swords, and &s;tabbed <HI>Gui&s;card</HI> in &s;everal Places; and their Attendants being called in,
<PB N="567" REF="595">
they dragged him out. <HI>Harley</HI>'s Wound was pre&s;ently &s;earched; it appeared to be a &s;light one, yet he was long in the Surgeon's hands: &s;ome imputed this to an ill Habit of Body; others thought it was an Artifice, to make it &s;eem more dangerous than indeed it was. <HI>Gui&s;card</HI>'s Wounds were deeper, and not ea&s;ily managed; for at fir&s;t he was &s;ullen, and &s;eemed re&s;olved to die; yet after a day, he &s;ubmitted him&s;elf to the Surgeons: But did not complain of a Wound in his Back, till it gangreened; and of that he died. It was not known, what Particulars were in his Letter, for various Reports went of it; nor was it known what he confe&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>This Accident was of great u&s;e to <HI>Harley;</HI> for the Party formed again&s;t him, was a&s;hamed to pu&s;h a Man, who was thus a&s;&s;a&s;&s;i|nated by one, that was &s;tudying to recommend him&s;elf to the Court of <HI>France,</HI> and who was believed to have formed a De&s;ign again&s;t the Queen's Per&s;on. Her Health was at this time much &s;haken. She had three Fits of an Ague; the la&s;t was a &s;evere one: but the Progre&s;s of the Di&s;ea&s;e was &s;topped by the Bark.</P>
<P>The Tories continued &s;till to pur&s;ue the Memory of K. <HI>William;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">A De&s;ign again&s;t King <HI>William</HI>'s Grants mi&s;|carries</NOTE> they complained of the Grants made by him, tho' the&s;e were far &s;hort of tho&s;e, that had been made by King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second; but that they might di&s;tingui&s;h between tho&s;e, whom they in|tended to favour, and others, again&s;t whom they were &s;et, they brought in a Bill, empowering &s;ome Per&s;ons to examine all the Grants made by him, and to report both the Value of them, and the Con&s;iderations upon which they were made: This was the Method, that had &s;ucceeded with them before, with relation to <HI>Ireland;</HI> &s;o the bringing in this Bill was looked on, as a &s;ure &s;tep, for carrying the Re&s;umption of all the Grants, that they had a mind to make void. When it was brought up to the Lords, the De&s;ign appeared to be an unju&s;t Malice again&s;t the Memory of our Deliverer, and again&s;t tho&s;e, who had &s;erved him be&s;t; &s;o upon the fir&s;t reading of the Bill, it was rejected.</P>
<P>Their Malice turned next again&s;t the Earl of <HI>Godolphin:</HI> They <NOTE PLACE="marg">Enquiries into the Ac|counts</NOTE> found, that the Supplies given by Parliament were not all re|turned, and the Accounts of many Millions were not yet pa&s;&s;ed in the <HI>Exchequer;</HI> &s;o they pa&s;&s;ed a Vote, that the Accounts of Thirty-five Millions yet &s;tood out. This was a va&s;t Sum; but to make it up, &s;ome Accounts in King <HI>Charles</HI>'s time were thrown into the heap; the Lord <HI>Ranelagh</HI>'s Accounts of the former Reign were the greate&s;t part; and it appeared, that in no time Accounts were &s;o regularly brought up, as in the Queen's Reign. Mr. <HI>Bridges</HI>'s Accounts, of fourteen or fifteen Millions, were the great <HI>Item,</HI> of which, not above half a Million was pa&s;&s;ed: But
<PB N="568" REF="596">
there were Accounts of above eleven Millions brought in, tho' not pa&s;s'd in form, thro' the great Caution and Exactne&s;s of the Duke of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> at who&s;e Office they were to pa&s;s; and he was very &s;low, and would allow nothing, without hearing Coun&s;el on every Article. The truth is, the Methods of pa&s;&s;ing Accounts were &s;o &s;ure, that they were very &s;low; and it was not po&s;&s;ible, for the proper Officer, to find Time and Lei&s;ure to pa&s;s the Accounts that were already in their hands. Upon this, tho' the Earl of <HI>Godolphin</HI> had managed the Trea&s;ury, with an Un|corruptne&s;s, Fidelity, and Diligence, that were &s;o unexceptiona|ble, that it was not po&s;&s;ible to fix any Cen&s;ure on his Admini|&s;tration; yet, becau&s;e many Accounts &s;tood out, they pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome angry Votes on that: But &s;ince nothing had appeared, in all the Examination they had made, that reflected on him, or on any of the Whigs, they would not con&s;ent to the Motion that was made, for printing that Report; for by that, it would have ap|peared, who had &s;erved well, and who had &s;erved ill.</P>
<P>When this Se&s;&s;ion drew near an end, &s;ome were concerned to find, that a Body, cho&s;en &s;o much by the Zeal and Influence of the Clergy, &s;hould have done nothing for the good of the Church; &s;o it being apparent, that in the Suburbs of <HI>London,</HI> there were about 200,000 People more, than could po&s;&s;ibly wor&s;hip God in the Churches built there, upon a Me&s;&s;age to them from the Queen (to which the Ri&s;e was given by an Addre&s;s to her from the Convocation) they voted that fifty more Churches &s;hould be built; and laid the Charge of it, upon that part of the Duty on Coals, that had been re&s;erved for building of <HI>St. Paul's,</HI> which was now fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>In the begining of <HI>April,</HI> the <HI>Dauphin</HI> and the Emperor both died of the Small Pox; the fir&s;t on the third, the &s;econd on the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Dau|phin</HI>'s Death, and the Em|peror's</NOTE> &s;ixth of the Month: Time will &s;hew what Influence the one or the other will have on publick Affairs. The Electors were all re&s;olved to chu&s;e King <HI>Charles</HI> Emperor. A little before the Emperor's Death, two great Affairs were fully &s;ettled; the Dif|ferences between that Court and the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> were com|po&s;ed, to the Duke's &s;atisfaction: The other was of more impor|tance; Offers of Amne&s;ty and Conce&s;&s;ions were &s;ent to the Male|contents in <HI>Hungary,</HI> with which they were &s;o well &s;atisfied, that a full Peace was like to follow on it: And, le&s;t the News of the Emperor's Death &s;hould be any &s;top to that Settlement, it was kept up from them, till a Body of 10,000 came in and de|livered up their Arms, with the Fort of <HI>Ca&s;&s;aw,</HI> and took an Oath of Obedience to King <HI>Charles,</HI> which was the fir&s;t notice they had of <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>'s Death.</P>
<P><PB N="569" REF="597">
The Effects of this will probably go farther, than barely to the quieting of <HI>Hungary:</HI> For the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> the <HI>Crim Tartar,</HI> and the Agents of <HI>France</HI> had &s;o animated the <HI>Turks</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">War break|ing out be|tween the <HI>Turk</HI> and the <HI>Czar.</HI></NOTE> again&s;t the <HI>Mu&s;covites;</HI> that tho' the Sultan had no mind to en|gage in a new War, till the Affairs of that Empire &s;hould be put in a better State; yet he was &s;o apprehen&s;ive of the Janizaries, that, much again&s;t his own Inclinations, he was brought to declare War again&s;t the <HI>Czar:</HI> But both the <HI>Czar</HI> and he &s;eemed in|clined to accept the Mediation, that was offered by <HI>England</HI> and by the <HI>States;</HI> to which very probably the <HI>Turks</HI> may the more ea&s;ily be brought, when they &s;ee no hope of any Advantage to be made, from the Di&s;tractions in <HI>Hungary.</HI></P>
<P>It did not yet appear, what would be undertaken on either &s;ide in <HI>Spain:</HI> King <HI>Philip</HI> had not yet opened the Campaign; but it was given out, that great Preparations were made for a Siege: On the other hand, King <HI>Charles</HI> had great Re-inforcements &s;ent him; &s;o that his Force was reckoned not inferiour to King <HI>Philip</HI>'s: Nor was it yet known, what Re&s;olutions he had taken, &s;ince he received the News of the Emperor's Death.</P>
<P>The Campaign was now opened on both &s;ides in the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> tho' later than was intended: The Sea&s;on continued long &s;o rainy, that all the Ways in tho&s;e parts were impracticable: Nothing was yet attempted on either &s;ide; both Armies lay near one another; and both were &s;o well po&s;ted, that no Attack was yet made: And this was the pre&s;ent State of Affairs abroad, at the end of <HI>May.</HI> At home Mr. <HI>Harley</HI> was created Earl of <HI>Oxford,</HI> and then made Lord High Trea&s;urer, and had now the &s;upreme Fa|vour: The Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament was not yet at an end. There had been a great Project carried on, for a Trade into the <HI>South Sea;</HI> and a Fund was projected, for paying the Intere&s;t of nine Millions, that were in Arrear for our Marine Affairs.</P>
<P>From our temporal Concerns, I turn to give an account of tho&s;e, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Convo|cation met.</NOTE> which related to the Church: The Convocation of the Province of <HI>Canterbury</HI> was opened, the 25th of <HI>November,</HI> the &s;ame day in which the Parliament met: And <HI>Atterbury</HI> was cho&s;en Pro|locutor. Soon after, the Queen &s;ent a Licence to the Convoca|tion, empowering them to enter upon &s;uch Con&s;ultations, as the pre&s;ent State of the Church required, and particularly to con&s;ider of &s;uch Matters, as &s;he &s;hould lay be&s;ore them; limiting them to a <HI>Quorum,</HI> that the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> or the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Bath and Wells</HI> &s;hould be pre&s;ent, and agree to their Re&s;olutions. With this Licence, there was a Let|ter directed to the Archbi&s;hop, in which the Convocation was ordered, to lay before the Queen an Account of the late exce&s;&s;ive
<PB N="570" REF="598">
growth of Infidelity and Here&s;y among us; and to con&s;ider how to redre&s;s Abu&s;es in Excommunications; how rural Deans might be made more effectual; how Terriers might be made and pre|&s;erved more exactly; and how the Abu&s;es in Licences for Mar|riage might be corrected.</P>
<P>In this whole Matter, neither the Archbi&s;hop nor any of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Exceptions to the Li|cence &s;ent them.</NOTE> Bi&s;hops were &s;o much as con&s;ulted with; and &s;ome things in the Licence were new: The Archbi&s;hop was not named the Pre&s;i|dent of the Convocation, as was u&s;ual in former Licences; and in the&s;e, the Archbi&s;hop's Pre&s;ence and Con&s;ent alone was made nece&s;&s;ary, except in ca&s;e of Sickne&s;s, and then the Archbi&s;hop had named &s;ome Bi&s;hops to pre&s;ide, as his Commi&s;&s;aries: And in that ca&s;e, the Convocation was limited to his Commi&s;&s;aries, which &s;till lodged the Pre&s;ident&s;hip and the Negative with the Archbi|&s;hop: This was according to the primitive Pattern, to limit the Clergy of a Province to do nothing, without the Con&s;ent of the Metropolitan; but it was a thing new and unheard-of, to limit the Convocation to any of their own Body, who had no Deputa|tion from the Archbi&s;hop. So a Report of this being made, by a Committee that was appointed to &s;earch the Records, it was laid before the Queen: And &s;he &s;ent us a Me&s;&s;age to let us know, that &s;he did not intend, that tho&s;e whom &s;he had named to be of the <HI>Quorum,</HI> &s;hould either pre&s;ide or have a Negative upon our Deliberations, tho' the contrary was plainly in&s;inuated in the Li|cence. The Archbi&s;hop was &s;o ill of the Gout, that after our fir&s;t Meetings, he could come no more to us; &s;o was the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London:</HI> upon which, the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Bath and Wells,</HI> &s;eeing how invidiou&s;ly he was di&s;tingui&s;hed from his Brethren, in which he had not been con&s;ulted, pretended ill Health; and we were at a &s;tand, till a new Licence was &s;ent us, in which the Bi&s;hops of <HI>Winche&s;ter, Bri&s;tol,</HI> and <HI>St. Davids,</HI> were added to be of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">A new Li|cence.</NOTE> <HI>Quorum.</HI> The two la&s;t were newly con&s;ecrated, and had been in no Functions in the Church before: So the Queen, not only pa&s;&s;ed over all the Bi&s;hops, made in King <HI>William</HI>'s Reign, but a great many of tho&s;e named by her&s;elf, and &s;et the two la&s;t in a Di&s;tinction above all their Brethren. All this was directed by <HI>Atterbury,</HI> who had the Confidence of the chief Mini&s;ter; and becau&s;e the other Bi&s;hops had maintained a good Corre&s;pondence with the former Mini&s;try, it was thought fit to put Marks of the Queen's Di&s;tru&s;t upon them, that it might appear, with whom her Royal Favour and Tru&s;t was lodged.</P>
<P>The Convocation entred on the Con&s;ideration of the Matters <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Repre&s;en|tation drawn for the Queen.</NOTE> referred to them by the Queen: And a Committee was appointed, to draw a Repre&s;entation of the pre&s;ent State of the Church, and
<PB N="571" REF="599">
of Religion among us; but after &s;ome Heads were agreed on, <HI>Atterbury</HI> procured, that the drawing of this might be left to him: And he drew up a mo&s;t virulent Declamation, defaming all the Admini&s;tration, from the time of the Revolution: Into this he brought many impious Principles and Practices, that had been little heard of or known, but were now to be publi&s;hed, if this &s;hould be laid before the Queen. The Lower Hou&s;e agreed to his Draught; but the Bi&s;hops laid it a&s;ide, and ordered ano|ther Repre&s;entation to be drawn, in more general and more mo|de&s;t Terms. It was not &s;ettled, which of the&s;e Draughts &s;hould be made u&s;e of, or whether any Repre&s;entation at all &s;hould be made to the Queen: For it was known, that the De&s;ign in asking one was only to have an A&s;per&s;ion ca&s;t, both on the former Mini&s;try and on the former Reign. Several Provi&s;ions were pre|pared, with relation to the other Particulars in the Queen's Let|ter: But none of the&s;e were agreed to by both Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>An Incident happened, that diverted their Thoughts to ano|ther <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Whi&s;ton</HI> re|vived <HI>Aria|ni&s;m.</HI></NOTE> matter: Mr. <HI>Whi&s;ton,</HI> the Profe&s;&s;or of Mathematicks in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> a learned Man, of a &s;ober and exemplary Life, but much &s;et on hunting for Paradoxes, fell on the reviving the <HI>Arian</HI> Here&s;y, tho' he pretended to differ from <HI>Arius,</HI> in &s;everal Parti|culars: Yet upon the main he was partly <HI>Apollinari&s;t,</HI> partly <HI>Arian;</HI> for he thought the <HI>Nous</HI> or <HI>Word</HI> was all the Soul that acted in our Saviour's Body. He found his Notions favoured by the Apo&s;tolical Con&s;titutions; &s;o he reckoned them a Part, and the chief Part of the Canon of the Scriptures. For the&s;e Tenets, he was cen&s;ured at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and expelled the Univer&s;ity: Upon that, he wrote a Vindication of him&s;elf and his Doctrine, and dedicated it to the Convocation, promi&s;ing a larger Work on the&s;e Subjects. The unconte&s;ted way of proceeding in &s;uch a ca&s;e was, that the Bi&s;hop of the Dioce&s;e, in which he lived, &s;hould cite him into his Court, in order to his Conviction or Cen&s;ure, from who&s;e Sentence an Appeal lay to the Archbi&s;hop, and from him to the Crown: Or the Archbi&s;hop might proceed in the fir&s;t in&s;tance in a Court of Audience: But we &s;aw no clear Precedents, of any Proceedings in Convocation, where the Juri&s;|diction was conte&s;ted; a Reference made by the High Com|mi&s;&s;ion to the Convocation, where the Party &s;ubmitted to do Penance, being the only Precedent that appeared in Hi&s;tory; and even of this we had no Record: &s;o that it not being thought a clear Warrant for our proceeding, we were at a &s;tand. The Act, that &s;ettled the cour&s;e of Appeals in King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth's Time, made no mention of Sentences in Convocation; and yet, by the Act in the fir&s;t of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> that defined
<PB N="572" REF="600">
what &s;hould be judged Here&s;y, that Judgment was declared to be in the Crown: By all this (which the Archbi&s;hop laid before the Bi&s;hops in a Letter, that he wrote to them on this occa&s;ion) it &s;eemed doubtful, whether the Convocation could, in the fir&s;t in|&s;tance, proceed again&s;t a Man for Here&s;y: And their Proceedings, if they were not warranted by Law, might involve them in a <HI>Prae|munire.</HI> So the Upper Hou&s;e, in an Addre&s;s, prayed the Queen to ask the Opinions of the Judges, and &s;uch others as &s;he thought fit, concerning the&s;e Doubts, that they might know how the Law &s;tood in this matter.</P>
<P>Eight of the Judges, with the Attorney and Sollicitor-General, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The diffe|rent Opi|nion, of the Judge, con|cerning the Power of the Convo|cation.</NOTE> gave their Opinion, that We had a Juri&s;diction, and might pro|ceed in &s;uch a ca&s;e; but brought no expre&s;s Law nor Precedent to &s;upport their Opinion: They only ob&s;erved, that the Law-Books &s;poke of the Convocation, as having Juri&s;diction; and they did not &s;ee that it was ever taken from them: They were al&s;o of Opinion, that an Appeal lay from the Sentence of Convo|cation to the Crown; but they re&s;erved to them&s;elves a Power to change their mind, in ca&s;e, upon an Argument that might be made for a Prohibition, they &s;hould &s;ee cau&s;e for it. Four of the Judges were po&s;itively of a contrary Opinion, and main|tained it from the Statutes made at the Reformation. The Queen, having received the&s;e different Opinions, &s;ent them to the Archbi&s;hop, to be laid before the two Hou&s;es of Convoca|tion; and, without taking any notice of the diver&s;ity between them, &s;he wrote that, there being now no doubt to be made of our Juri&s;diction, &s;he did expect, that we &s;hould proceed in the Matter before us. In this it was vi&s;ible, that Tho&s;e who advi&s;ed the Queen to write that Letter, con&s;idered more their own Hu|mours than her Honour. Yet two great Doubts &s;till remained, even &s;uppo&s;ing we had a Juri&s;diction: The fir&s;t was, of whom the Court was to be compo&s;ed; whether only of the Bi&s;hops, or what &s;hare the Lower Hou&s;e had in this Judiciary Authority: The other was, by what Delegates, in ca&s;e of an Appeal, our Sentence was to be examined: Were no Bi&s;hops to be in the Court of Dele|gates? Or was the Sentence of the Archbi&s;hop and his twenty|one Suffragan Bi&s;hops, with the Clergy of the Province, to be judged by the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>York</HI> and his three Suffragan Bi|&s;hops? The&s;e Difficulties appearing to be &s;o great, the Bi&s;hops re&s;olved to begin with that, in which they had, by the Queen's Licence, an Undi&s;putable Authority; which was to examine and cen&s;ure the Book, and to &s;ee if his Doctrine was not contrary to the Scriptures, and the fir&s;t four General Councils, which is the Mea&s;ure &s;et by Law, to judge Here&s;y. They drew out &s;ome Pro|po&s;itions
<PB N="573" REF="601">
from his Book, which &s;eemed plainly to be the reviving of <HI>Ariani&s;m;</HI> and cen&s;ured them as &s;uch. The&s;e they &s;ent down to the Lower Hou&s;e, who, tho' they excepted to one Propo&s;ition, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Whi&s;ton</HI>'s Doctrines condemned</NOTE> yet cen&s;ured the re&s;t in the &s;ame manner. This the Archbi&s;hop (being then di&s;abled by the Gout) &s;ent by one of the Bi&s;hops to the Queen for her A&s;&s;ent, who promi&s;ed to con&s;ider of it: But to end the matter at once, at their next meeting in Winter, no An&s;wer being come from the Queen, two Bi&s;hops were &s;ent to ask it; but &s;he could not tell, what was become of the Paper, which the Archbi&s;hop had &s;ent her; &s;o a new Extract of the Cen|&s;ure was again &s;ent to her: But &s;he has not yet thought fit, to &s;end any An&s;wer to it. So <HI>Whi&s;ton</HI>'s Affair &s;leeps, tho' he has publi&s;hed a large Work in four Volumes in Octavo, ju&s;tifying his Doctrine, and maintaining the Canonicalne&s;s of the Apo&s;tolical Con&s;titutions, preferring their Authority not only to the Epi&s;tles, but even to the Go&s;pels. In this la&s;t I do not find he has made any <HI>Pro&s;e|lytes,</HI> tho' he has &s;et him&s;elf much to &s;upport that Paradox.</P>
<P>The Lower Hou&s;e would not enter into the Con&s;ideration of the Repre&s;entation, &s;ent down to them by the Bi&s;hops; &s;o none was agreed on, to be pre&s;ented to the Queen: But both were printed, and &s;evere Reflections were made, in &s;everal Tracts, on that which was drawn by the Lower Hou&s;e, or rather by <HI>Atterbury.</HI> The Bi&s;hops went thro' all the Matters, recommended to them by the Queen; and drew up a Scheme of Regulations on them all: But neither were The&s;e agreed to, by the Lower Hou&s;e; for their Spirits were &s;o exa&s;perated, that nothing &s;ent by the Bi&s;hops could be agreeable to them. At la&s;t the Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament and Con|vocation came to an end.</P>
<P>The la&s;t thing &s;ettled by the Parliament was, the creating a <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Act Act for the <HI>South$span$ Sea</HI> $word$</NOTE> new Fund for a Trade in the <HI>South Sea:</HI> There was a great Debt upon the Navy, occa&s;ioned partly, by the Deficiency of the Funds appointed for the Service at Sea, but chiefly by the nece&s;|&s;ity of applying &s;uch Supplies as were given, without Appropria|ting Clau&s;es, to the Service abroad; where it was impo&s;&s;ible to carry it on by Credit, without ready Money, &s;o it was judged ne|ce&s;&s;ary to let the Debt of the Navy run on upon Credit: This had ri&s;en up to &s;everal Millions; and the Di&s;count on the Navy-Bills ran high. All this Debt was thrown into one Stock; and a Fund was formed, for paying the Intere&s;t at 6 <HI>per Cent.</HI></P>
<P>The Flatterers of the new Mini&s;ters made great u&s;e of this, to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections on the old Mini&s;try fully cleared</NOTE> magnify them, and to a&s;per&s;e the old Mini&s;try: But a full Report of that matter was &s;oon after publi&s;hed, by which it appeared, that the publick Money had been managed with the utmo&s;t fidelity and frugality; and it was made evident, that when there was not
<PB N="574" REF="602">
Money enough to an&s;wer all the Expence of the War, it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to apply it to that, which pre&s;&s;ed mo&s;t, and where the Service could not be carried on by Credit: So this Debt was con|tracted by an inevitable Nece&s;&s;ity; and all rea&s;onable Per&s;ons were fully &s;atisfied with this Account of the Matter. The Earl of <HI>Go|dolphin</HI>'s unblemi&s;h'd Integrity was &s;uch, that no Imputation of any &s;ort could be fa&s;tened on him; &s;o, to keep up a Clamour, they reflected on the Expence he had run the Nation into, upon the early Succe&s;&s;es in the Year 1706; which were very ju&s;tly ac|knowledged, and cleared in the &s;ucceeding Se&s;&s;ion, as was for|merly told: But that was now revived; and it was &s;aid to be an Inva&s;ion of the great Right of the Commons in giving Supplies, to enter on De&s;igns and to engage the Nation in an Expence, not provided for by Parliament. This was aggravated, with many tragical Expre&s;&s;ions, as a Subver&s;ion of the Con&s;titution; &s;o with this, and that of the thirty-five Millions, of which the Accounts were not yet pa&s;s'd, and &s;ome other Particulars, they made an inflaming Addre&s;s to the Queen, at the end of the Se&s;&s;ions. And this was artificially &s;pread thro' the Nation, by which weaker Minds were &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, that it was not ea&s;y to undeceive them, even by the fulle&s;t and cleare&s;t Evidences; the Nation &s;eemed &s;till infatuated beyond the power of Conviction. With this the Se&s;&s;ion ended, and all con&s;idering Per&s;ons had a very melancholy Pro&s;pect, when they &s;aw what might be apprehended from the two Se&s;&s;ions, that were yet to come of the &s;ame Parliament.</P>
<P>I now turn to Affairs abroad. The Bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Spain</HI> had <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in <HI>Spain.</HI></NOTE> been &s;o much pre&s;&s;ed from the Throne, and &s;o much in&s;i&s;ted on all this Se&s;&s;ion, and the Commons had given 1,500,000 <HI>l.</HI> for that Service (a Sum far beyond all that had been granted in any preceding Se&s;&s;ion) &s;o that it was expected, Matters would have been carried there in another manner than formerly. The Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> was &s;ent to command the Queen's Troops there, and he &s;eemed full of Heat: But all our Hopes failed. The Duke of <HI>Vendome</HI>'s Army was in &s;o ill a condition, that if <HI>Starembergh</HI> had been &s;upported, he promi&s;ed him&s;elf great Advantages: It does not yet appear what made this to fail; for the Parliament has not yet taken this into Examination. It is certain the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> did nothing; neither he nor his Troops were once named, during the whole Campaign; he wrote over very heavy Complaints, that he was not &s;upported, by the failing of the Remittances, that he expected: But what ground there was for that, does not yet appear: For, tho' he afterwards came over, he was very &s;ilent, and &s;eemed in a good Under&s;tanding with the Mini&s;ters. <HI>Starembergh</HI> drew out his Forces; and the two Armies
<PB N="575" REF="603">
lay for &s;ome time looking on one another, without coming to any Action: <HI>Vendome</HI> ordered a Siege to be laid to two &s;mall Places, but without Succe&s;s. That of <HI>Cardona</HI> was per&s;i&s;ted in ob&s;tinately, till near the end of <HI>December,</HI> and then <HI>Starembergh</HI> &s;ent &s;ome Bodies to rai&s;e the Siege, who &s;ucceeded &s;o well in their Attempt, that they killed 2000 of the Be&s;iegers, and forced their Camp; &s;o that they not only rai&s;ed the Siege, but made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the Enemies Artillery, Ammunition, and Baggage; and the Duke of <HI>Vendome</HI>'s Army was &s;o dimini&s;hed, that if <HI>Starem|bergh</HI> had received the A&s;&s;i&s;tance, which he expected from <HI>Eng|land,</HI> he would have pierced far into <HI>Spain.</HI> But we did nothing, after all the Zeal we had expre&s;s'd for retrieving Matters on that &s;ide.</P>
<P>The Emperor's Death, as it pre&s;ently opened to King <HI>Charles</HI> the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Elec|tion of King <HI>Charles</HI> to be Emperor.</NOTE> Succe&s;&s;ion to the Hereditary Dominions; &s;o a Di&s;po&s;ition appeared unanimou&s;ly, among all the Electors, to chu&s;e him Emperor: Yet he &s;taid in <HI>Barcelona</HI> till <HI>September;</HI> and then leaving his Queen behind, to &s;upport his Affairs in <HI>Spain,</HI> he &s;ailed over to <HI>Italy:</HI> He &s;taid &s;ome Weeks at <HI>Milan,</HI> where the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> came to him; and we were told, that all Matters in debate were adju&s;ted between them. We hoped this Campaign would have produced &s;omewhat in tho&s;e Parts, of advantage to the common Cau&s;e, upon the Agreement made before the Emperor <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>'s Death. And Mr. <HI>St. John,</HI> when he moved in the Hou&s;e of Commons, for the Sub&s;idies to the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> &s;aid, all our hopes of Suc|ce&s;s this Year lay in that Quarter; for in <HI>Flanders</HI> we could do nothing. The Duke came into <HI>Savoy,</HI> and it was given out that he was re&s;olved to pre&s;s forward; but upon what Views, it was not then known, he &s;top'd his Cour&s;e; and after a &s;hort Cam|paign, repa&s;&s;ed the Mountains.</P>
<P>The Election of the Emperor came on at <HI>Francfort,</HI> where &s;ome Electors came in Per&s;on, others &s;ent their Deputies; &s;ome Weeks were &s;pent in preparing the Capitulations; great Appli|cations were made to them, to receive Deputies from the Elec|tors of <HI>Bavaria</HI> and <HI>Cologne;</HI> but they were rejected, for they were under the <HI>Ban</HI> of the Empire; nor were they plea&s;ed, with the Interpo&s;ition of the Pope's <HI>Nuntio,</HI> who gave them much trouble in that Matter; but they per&s;i&s;ted in refu&s;ing to admit them. <HI>Francfort</HI> lay &s;o near the Frontier of the Empire, that it was ap|prehended, the <HI>French</HI> might have made an Attempt that way; for they drew &s;ome Detachments from their Army in <HI>Flanders,</HI> to encrea&s;e their Forces on the <HI>Rhine.</HI> This obliged Prince <HI>Eugene,</HI> after he, in conjunction with the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> had opened the Campaign in <HI>Flanders,</HI> to draw off a Detachment
<PB N="576" REF="604">
from thence, and march with it towards the <HI>Rhine;</HI> and there he commanded the Imperial Army; and came in good time, to &s;ecure the Electors at <HI>Francfort;</HI> who being now &s;afe, from the fear of any In&s;ult, went on &s;lowly in all that they thought fit to propo&s;e, previous to an Election; and concluded unanimou&s;ly to chu&s;e <HI>Charles,</HI> who was now declared Emperor by the Name of <HI>Charles</HI> the Sixth: He went from <HI>Milan</HI> to <HI>In&s;pruck,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Francfort,</HI> where he was crowned with the u&s;ual Solemnity. Thus that Matter was happily ended, and no Action happened on the <HI>Rhine</HI> all this Campaign.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Marlborough's</HI> Army was not only weakened by <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of <HI>Marlbo|rough</HI> pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>French</HI> Lines.</NOTE> the Detachment, that Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> carried to the <HI>Rhine,</HI> but by the calling over 5000 Men of the be&s;t Bodies of his Army, for an Expedition de&s;igned by Sea; &s;o that the <HI>French</HI> were &s;u|periour to him in number: They lay behind Lines, that were looked on as &s;o &s;trong, that the forcing them was thought an impracticable thing; and it was &s;aid, that <HI>Villars</HI> had wrote to the <HI>French</HI> King, that he had put a <HI>Ne plus ultra</HI> to the Duke of <HI>Marlborough:</HI> But, contrary to all expectation, he did &s;o amu&s;e <HI>Villars</HI> with &s;eint Motions, that at la&s;t, to the &s;urprize of all <HI>Europe,</HI> he pa&s;s'd the Lines near <HI>Bouchain,</HI> without the lo&s;s of a Man.</P>
<P>This rai&s;ed his Character, beyond all that he had done for|merly; the De&s;ign was &s;o well laid, and was &s;o happily executed, that in all Mens Opinions, it pa&s;s'd for a Ma&s;ter-piece of military Skill; the honour of it falling entirely on the Duke of <HI>Marlbo|rough,</HI> no other Per&s;on having any &s;hare, except in the Execu|tion. When our Army was now &s;o happily got within the <HI>French</HI> Lines, the <HI>Dutch</HI> Deputies propo&s;ed the attacking the <HI>French,</HI> and venturing a Battle, &s;ince this Surprize had put them in no &s;mall Di&s;order. The Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> differed from them, he thought there might be too much Danger in that At|tempt; the Army was much fatigued with &s;o long a March, in which their Cavalry had been eight and forty Hours on hor&s;e|back, alighting only twice, about an Hour at a time, to feed their Hor&s;es; for they marched eleven Leagues in one Day: The <HI>French</HI> were fre&s;h; and our Army was in no condition to enter upon Action, till &s;ome time was allowed for Refre&s;hment: And the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> thought that, in ca&s;e of a Misfor|tune, their being within the <HI>French</HI> Lines might be fatal.</P>
<P>He propo&s;ed the be&s;ieging <HI>Bouchain;</HI> which he thought might <NOTE PLACE="marg">He be&s;ieged <HI>Bouchain.</HI></NOTE> oblige the <HI>French</HI> to endeavour to rai&s;e the Siege; and that might give occa&s;ion to their fighting on more equal Terms; or it would bring both a Di&s;reputation and a Di&s;heartening on their Army,
<PB N="577" REF="605">
if a Place of &s;uch Importance &s;hould be taken in their &s;ight: Both the <HI>Dutch</HI> Deputies and the General Officers thought the De&s;ign was too bold, yet they &s;ubmitted to him in the Matter: It &s;eemed impracticable to take a Place, &s;ituated in a Mora&s;s, well fortified, with a good Garri&s;on in it, in the &s;ight of a &s;uperior Army; for the <HI>French</HI> lay within a Mile of them: There was al&s;o great dan|ger from the Excur&s;ions, that the Garri&s;ons of <HI>Valenciennes</HI> and <HI>Cond&eacute;</HI> might make, to cut off their Provi&s;ions, which were to come to them from <HI>Tournay.</HI> All about the Duke &s;tudied to di|vert him from &s;o dangerous an Undertaking; &s;ince a Misfortune in his Conduct would have furni&s;hed his Enemies with the Advan|tages, that they waited for. He was &s;en&s;ible of all this, yet he had laid the Scheme &s;o well, that he re&s;olved to venture on it: the <HI>French</HI> tried to throw more Men into the Place, by a narrow Cau&s;eway thro' the Mora&s;s, but he took his Mea&s;ures &s;o well, that he was guarded again&s;t every thing: He &s;aw what the Event of the Siege might be; &s;o he be&s;tirred him&s;elf with unu&s;ual Appli|cation, and was more fatigued in the cour&s;e of this Siege, than he had been at any time, during the whole War. He carried on the Trenches, and by his Batteries and Bombs the Place was &s;oon laid in Ruins. <HI>Villars</HI> &s;eemed to be very bu&s;y, but to no purpo&s;e; yet, &s;eeing he could not rai&s;e the Siege, he tried to &s;urprize <HI>Doway;</HI> but they di&s;covered the De&s;ign, and forced the Body that was &s;ent thither, to retreat in all ha&s;te. After twenty Days, from the opening the Trenches, the Garri&s;on of <HI>Bouchain</HI> capitulated; <NOTE PLACE="marg">And took it.</NOTE> and could have no better Terms than to be made Pri&s;oners of War. As this was reckoned the mo&s;t extraordinary thing in the whole Hi&s;tory of the War, &s;o the Honour of it was acknowledged to be|long wholly to the Duke of <HI>Marlborough;</HI> as the Blame of a Mi&s;|carriage in it mu&s;t have fallen &s;ingly on him. <HI>Villar</HI>'s Conduct on this occa&s;ion was much cen&s;ured; but it was approved by the King of <HI>France:</HI> And with this the Campaign ended in tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P>No Action happened at Sea, for the <HI>French</HI> had no Fleet out: An Expedition was de&s;igned by Sea for taking <HI>Quebec</HI> and <HI>Pla|centia;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Expedi|tion by Sea to <HI>Canada.</HI></NOTE> and for that end, 5000 Men were brought from <HI>Flan|ders: Hill,</HI> who was Brother to the Favourite, had the Com|mand. There was a &s;trong Squadron of Men of War ordered, to &s;ecure the Tran&s;port Fleet; they were furni&s;hed from hence with Provi&s;ions, only for three Months; but they de&s;igned to take in a &s;econd Supply at <HI>New England.</HI> A Commi&s;&s;ioner of the Victual|ling then told me, he could not gue&s;s what made them be &s;ent out &s;o ill furni&s;hed; for they had Stores, lying on their hands, for a full Supply. They &s;ailed, &s;oon after the end of the Se&s;&s;ion, and
<PB N="578" REF="606">
had a quick Pa&s;&s;age to <HI>New England;</HI> but were forced to &s;tay many Weeks on that Coa&s;t, before they could be &s;upplied with Provi&s;ions: They &s;ailed near the end of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> into the River of <HI>Canada,</HI> which was thirty Miles broad: But they were ill &s;erved with Pilots; and at that Sea&s;on, Storms were ordinary in tho&s;e parts: One of the&s;e broke upon them, by which &s;everal Ships were over&s;et, and about 2500 Men were lo&s;t. Thus the De&s;ign <NOTE PLACE="marg">It mi&s;car|ried.</NOTE> of <HI>Quebec</HI> mi&s;carried; and their Provi&s;ions were too &s;canty, to venture an Attempt on <HI>Placentia:</HI> So they returned home un|pro&s;perous.</P>
<P>This was a great Mortification to the new Mini&s;try; it being their fir&s;t Undertaking, ill projected, and wor&s;e executed, in every &s;tep of it: It was the more liable to Cen&s;ure, becau&s;e at the very time, that the old Mini&s;try were charged with entring on De&s;igns, that had not been laid before the Parliament, and for which no Supplies had been given, they projected this, even while a Se&s;&s;ion was yet going on, without communicating it to the Par+liament; whereas, what the former Mini&s;try had done this way, was upon Emergents, and Succe&s;&s;es, after the end of the Se&s;&s;ion: But this Matter has not yet been brought under a Parliamentary Examination, &s;o the Di&s;coveries, that may be made if that hap|pens, mu&s;t be referred to their proper place. This was the State of our Affairs during this Campaign; the Merchants complained of great Lo&s;&s;es made at Sea, by the ill Management of Convoys and Cruizers.</P>
<P>The War between the <HI>Turk</HI> and the <HI>Czar</HI> came to a quick <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in <HI>Turkey.</HI></NOTE> end: The <HI>Czar</HI> advanced with his Army &s;o far into <HI>Moldavia,</HI> that he was cut off from his Provi&s;ions: An Engagement followed, in which both &s;ides pretended they had the advantage. It is cer|tain, the <HI>Czar</HI> found he was reduced to great Extremities; for he propo&s;ed, in order to a Peace, to &s;urrender <HI>Azuph,</HI> with &s;ome other Places, and demanded that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> might be &s;ent home to his own Country. The <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> was glad to arrive at &s;o &s;peedy a Conclu&s;ion of the War; and, notwith&s;tand|ing the great Oppo&s;ition made by the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> he con|cluded a Peace with the <HI>Mu&s;covite,</HI> not without &s;u&s;picion of his being corrupted by Money to it. The King of <HI>Sweden</HI> being highly offended at this, charged the <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> for neglect|ing the great Advantages he had over the <HI>Czar,</HI> &s;ince he and his whole Army were at mercy; and he prevailed &s;o far at the <HI>Port,</HI> that upon it the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> was depo&s;ed, and there was an appearance of a War ready to break out the next Year: for the <HI>Czar</HI> delayed the rendring <HI>Azuph</HI> and the other Places agreed to be delivered up; pretending that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> was not
<PB N="579" REF="607">
&s;ent home, according to agreement; yet to prevent a new War, all the Places were at length delivered up: What Effect this may have, mu&s;t be left to farther time.</P>
<P>Towards the end of the Year the <HI>Danes</HI> and <HI>Saxons</HI> broke in <NOTE PLACE="marg">And in <HI>Po|merania.</HI></NOTE> by concert upon <HI>Pomerania,</HI> re&s;olving to be&s;iege <HI>Stralzund;</HI> but every thing nece&s;&s;ary for a Siege came &s;o &s;lowly from <HI>Denmark,</HI> that no Progre&s;s was made, tho' the Troops lay near the Place, for &s;ome Months; and in that time the <HI>Swedes</HI> landed a con&s;i|derable Body of Men, in the I&s;le of <HI>Rugen:</HI> At la&s;t the Be&s;iegers, being in want of every thing, were forced to rai&s;e the Siege, and to retire from that Neighbourhood, in the beginning of <HI>January.</HI> They &s;ate down next before <HI>Wi&s;mar,</HI> but that Attempt likewi&s;e mi&s;carried, which rendered the Conduct of the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> very contemptible; who thus ob&s;tinately carried on a War (at a time that a Plague &s;wept away a third part of the People of <HI>Copen|hagen)</HI> with as little Conduct as Succe&s;s. Having thus given a &s;hort View of Affairs abroad;</P>
<P>I come next to give the be&s;t Account I can, of a &s;ecret and im|portant <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Harley</HI> made an Earl, and Lord Trea|&s;urer.</NOTE> Tran&s;action at home: The Mini&s;ters now found, how hard it was to re&s;tore Credit, and by con&s;equence to carry on the War; Mr. <HI>Harley</HI>'s Wound gave the Queen the occa&s;ion, which &s;he &s;eemed to be waiting for; upon his Recovery &s;he had created him an Earl, by a double Title, of <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Mortimer.</HI> Preambles to Patents of Honour u&s;ually carry in them a &s;hort Account of the Dignity of the Family; and of the Services of the Per&s;on advanced: But his Preamble was very pompous, and &s;et him out in the mo&s;t extravagant Characters that Flatterers could invent; in particular it &s;aid, that he had redeemed the Nation from Robbery, had re&s;tored Credit, and had rendered the Publick great Service in a cour&s;e of many Years: All this was &s;et out in too ful&s;ome Rhetorick, and being prepared by his own Direction, plea&s;ed him &s;o much, that whereas all other Patents had been only read in the Hou&s;e of Lords, this was printed. He was at the &s;ame time made Lord Trea&s;urer, and became the chief, if not &s;ole Mini&s;ter, for every thing was di|rected by him. It &s;oon appeared, that his Strength lay in managing Parties, and in engaging weak People by Rewards and Promi&s;es, to depend upon him; but that he neither thoroughly under&s;tood the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Trea&s;ury, nor the Conduct of foreign Affairs. But he tru&s;ted to his Intere&s;t in the Queen and in the Favourite.</P>
<P>He &s;aw the Load, that the carrying on the War mu&s;t bring <NOTE PLACE="marg">Negotia|tions for a Peace with <HI>France.</HI></NOTE> upon him; &s;o he re&s;olved to &s;trike up a Peace as &s;oon as was po&s;|&s;ible. The Earl of <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> had &s;ome Corre&s;pondence in <HI>Paris</HI> and at <HI>St. Germains,</HI> &s;o he tru&s;ted the Conduct of the Negotiation to him. The Duke of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> who was Lord Privy Seal, died
<PB N="580" REF="608">
of an Apoplexy in <HI>July,</HI> being the riche&s;t Subject that had been in <HI>England</HI> for &s;ome Ages; he had an E&s;tate of above 40000 <HI>l.</HI> a-year, and was much &s;et on encrea&s;ing it. Upon his Death it was re&s;olved to give the Earl of <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> the Privy Seal; but he died &s;uddenly the very day in which it was to be given him; upon that it was conferred on <HI>Robin&s;on,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> who was de&s;igned to be the Plenipotentiary in the Treaty, that was projected. One <HI>Prior,</HI> who had been <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI>'s Secretary, upon his Death, was im|ployed to pro&s;ecute that, which the other did not live to fini&s;h. <HI>Prior</HI> had been taken a Boy, out of a Tavern, by the Earl of <HI>Dor&s;et,</HI> who accidentally found him reading <HI>Horace;</HI> and he, be|ing very generous, gave him an Education in Literature: He was &s;ent to the Court of <HI>France</HI> in <HI>September,</HI> to try on what Terms we might expect a Peace; his Journey was carried on &s;ecretly; but upon his Return, he was &s;topt at <HI>Dover;</HI> and a Packet, that he brought, was kept, till an Order came from Court to &s;et him free: And by this Accident the Secret broke out. Soon after that, one <HI>Me&s;nager</HI> was &s;ent over from <HI>France,</HI> with Preliminaries; but very different from tho&s;e, that had been concerted at the <HI>Hague,</HI> two Years before.</P>
<P>By the&s;e, the King of <HI>France</HI> offered, to acknowledge the Queen, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Prelimina|ries offered by <HI>France.</HI></NOTE> and the Succe&s;&s;ion to the Crown, according to the pre&s;ent Settle|ment; and that he would <HI>bona fide</HI> enter into &s;uch Mea&s;ures, that the Crowns of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> &s;hould never belong to the &s;ame Per&s;on; that he would &s;ettle a &s;afe and proper Barrier to all the Allies; that he would raze <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> provided an Equivalent &s;hould be given, for de&s;troying the Fortifications, he had made there, at &s;o great an Expence; and that he would procure both to <HI>England</HI> and to the <HI>States</HI> the re-e&s;tabli&s;hing of their Com|merce. The Court was then at <HI>Wind&s;or:</HI> The&s;e Propo&s;itions were &s;o well entertained at our Court, that a Copy of them was or|dered to be given to Count <HI>Gallas,</HI> the Emperor's Mini&s;ter; he treated the&s;e Offers with much Scorn, and printed the Prelimina|ries in one of our News-Papers; &s;oon after that, he was ordered to come no more to Court, but to make ha&s;te out of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The proceeding was &s;evere and unu&s;ual; for the common Me|thod, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Count <HI>Gal|las</HI> &s;ent a|way with Di&s;grace.</NOTE> when a Provocation was given by a Publick Mini&s;ter, was to complain of him to his Ma&s;ter, and to de&s;ire him to be recalled. It was not then known upon what this was grounded; that which was &s;urmized was, that his Secretary <HI>Gaultier</HI> (who was a Prie&s;t) betrayed him; and di&s;covered his &s;ecret Corre&s;pondence, and the Adverti&s;ements he &s;ent the Emperor, to give him ill Impre&s;&s;ions of our Court; &s;or which Treachery he was rewarded with an Abbey in <HI>France:</HI> But of this I have no certain Information.</P>
<P><PB N="581" REF="609">
When our Court was re&s;olved on this Project; they knew the Lord <HI>Town&s;hend</HI> &s;o well, that they could not depend on his &s;erv|ing their ends; &s;o he was both recalled and di&s;graced: And <NOTE PLACE="marg">Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> &s;ent Amba&s;|&s;ador to <HI>Holland.</HI></NOTE> the Lord <HI>Raby</HI> was brought from the Court of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> and ad|vanced to be Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> and &s;ent Amba&s;&s;ador to <HI>Holland.</HI> It was not then known, how far our Court carried the Negotia|tions with <HI>France;</HI> it was not certain, whether they only ac|cepted of the&s;e Preliminaries, as a Foundation for a Treaty, to be opened upon them; or if any private Promi&s;e or Treaty was &s;igned: This la&s;t was very po&s;itively given out, both in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI> The very treating, without the concurrence of our Allies, was certainly an open Violation of our Alliances, which had expre&s;sly provided again&s;t any &s;uch Negotiation.</P>
<P>Many mercenary Pens were &s;et on work, to ju&s;tify our Pro|ceedings, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Many Libels again&s;t the Allies.</NOTE> and to defame our Allies, more particularly the <HI>Dutch;</HI> this was done with much Art, but with no regard to Truth, in a Pamphlet entitled the <HI>Conduct of the Allies, and of the late Mi|ni&s;try;</HI> to which very full An&s;wers were written, detecting the Thread of Fal&s;hood, that ran thro' that Work. It was now &s;aid, <HI>England</HI> was &s;o exhau&s;ted, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to carry on the War: And when King <HI>Charles</HI> was cho&s;en Emperor, it was al&s;o &s;aid, he would be too great and too dangerous to all his Neighbours, if <HI>Spain</HI> were join'd to the Emperor and to the Hereditary Dominions: It was al&s;o zealou&s;ly, tho' mo&s;t fal&s;ely, infu&s;ed into the Minds of the People, that our Allies, mo&s;t par|ticularly the <HI>Dutch,</HI> had impo&s;ed on us, and failed us on many occa&s;ions. The <HI>Jacobites</HI> did, with the greater Joy entertain this Pro&s;pect of Peace, becau&s;e the <HI>Dauphin</HI> had, in a Vi&s;it to <HI>St. Germains,</HI> congratulated that Court upon it; which made them conclude, that it was to have a happy effect, with relation to the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s Affairs.</P>
<P>Our Court denied this; and &s;ent the Earl of <HI>Rivers</HI> to <HI>Ha|nover,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Earl <HI>Rivers</HI> &s;ent to <HI>Ha|nover,</HI> but &s;ucceeded not.</NOTE> to a&s;&s;ure the Elector, that the Queen would take e&s;pecial care, to have the Succe&s;&s;ion to the Crown &s;ecured to his Fa|mily, by the Treaty that was to be opened: This made little impre&s;&s;ion on that Elector; for he &s;aw clearly, that if <HI>Spain</HI> and the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> were left to King <HI>Philip,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> would &s;oon become the &s;uperiour Power to all the re&s;t of <HI>Europe;</HI> that <HI>France</HI> would keep <HI>Spain</HI> in &s;ubjection, and by the Wealth they would fetch from the <HI>Indies,</HI> they would give Law to all a|bout them, and &s;et what King they plea&s;ed on the Throne of <HI>England.</HI> Earl <HI>Rivers</HI> &s;taid a few days there, and brought an An&s;wer from the Elector in Writing; yet the Elector apprehend|ed, not without rea&s;on, that it might be &s;tifled; therefore he
<PB N="582" REF="610">
ordered his Mini&s;ter to give a full Memorial, to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, of which our Court took no notice: But the Memorial was tran&s;lated and printed here, to the great &s;atisfaction of all tho&s;e, who were afraid of the ill De&s;igns, that might be hid, under the pretence of the Treaty then propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> pre&s;&s;ed the <HI>States,</HI> to comply with the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>States</HI> are $word$ to open a Treaty.</NOTE> Queen's De&s;ire, of opening a Treaty: They an&s;wered very &s;lowly, being de&s;irous to &s;ee how the Parliament was inclined; but the Parliament was prorogued from the 13th to the 29th of <HI>Novem|ber,</HI> and from that to the 7th of <HI>December.</HI> It was al&s;o reported in <HI>Holland,</HI> that the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> (&s;eeing the <HI>States</HI> &s;low in granting the Pa&s;&s;ports, and upon that apprehending the&s;e Delays flowed from their expecting to &s;ee, how the Parliament of <HI>Eng|land</HI> approved of the&s;e Steps) told them plainly, that till they agreed to a Treaty, and granted the Pa&s;&s;ports, the Se&s;&s;ion &s;hould not be opened: So they granted them, and left the Time and Place of Treaty, to the Queen's Determination. She named <HI>Utrecht</HI> as the Place of Congre&s;s, and the fir&s;t of <HI>January</HI> O. S. for opening it; and wrote a circular Letter to all the Allies, in|viting them to &s;end Plenipotentiaries to that Place. The Empe|ror &s;et him&s;elf vehemently to oppo&s;e the Progre&s;s of this Matter; he &s;ent Prince <HI>Eugene,</HI> to di&s;&s;uade the <HI>States</HI> from agreeing to it, and offered a new Scheme of the War, that &s;hould be ea&s;ier to the Allies, and lie heavier on him&s;elf: But the Pa&s;&s;ports were now &s;ent to the Court of <HI>France;</HI> that Court demanded Pa&s;&s;|ports likewi&s;e, for the Plenipotentiaries of King <HI>Philip,</HI> and of the Electors of <HI>Bavaria</HI> and <HI>Cologn:</HI> this was offered by our Court to the <HI>States,</HI> they refu&s;ed it, but whether our Mini&s;ters then agreed to it or not, I cannot tell.</P>
<P>Before the opening the Se&s;&s;ion, Pains were taken on many Per|&s;ons, <NOTE PLACE="marg">$para$.</NOTE> to per&s;uade them to agree to the Mea&s;ures the Court were in; the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> upon his coming over, &s;poke ve|ry plainly to the Queen again&s;t the Steps, that were already made; but he found her &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, that what he &s;aid made no Im|pre&s;&s;ion, &s;o he de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed from coming to Council, &s;ince he mu&s;t oppo&s;e every &s;tep, that was made in that Affair. Among others, the Queen &s;poke to my&s;elf; &s;he &s;aid, &s;he hoped Bi&s;hops would not be again&s;t Peace: I &s;aid, a good Peace was what we prayed daily for, but the Preliminaries offered by <HI>France</HI> gave no hopes of &s;uch an one; and the tru&s;ting to the King of <HI>France</HI>'s Faith, after all that had pa&s;s'd, would &s;eem a &s;trange thing. She &s;aid, we were not to regard the Preliminaries; we &s;hould have a Peace upon &s;uch a bottom, that we &s;hould not at all rely on the King of <HI>France</HI>'s Word; but we ought to &s;u&s;pend
<PB N="583" REF="611">
our Opinions, till &s;he acquainted us with the whole Matter. I asked leave to &s;peak my Mind plainly; which &s;he granted: I &s;aid, any Treaty by which <HI>Spain</HI> and the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> were left to King <HI>Philip,</HI> mu&s;t in a little while deliver up all <HI>Europe</HI> into the hands of <HI>France;</HI> and, if any &s;uch Peace &s;hould be made, &s;he was betrayed, and we were all ruined; in le&s;s than three Years time, &s;he would be murdered, and the Fires would be again rai&s;ed in <HI>Smithfield:</HI> I pur&s;ued this long, till I &s;aw &s;he grew unea&s;y; &s;o I withdrew.</P>
<P>On the &s;eventh of <HI>December,</HI> &s;he opened the Parliament: In <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen's Speech to the two Hou&s;es.</NOTE> her Speech &s;he &s;aid, notwith&s;tanding the Arts of tho&s;e who de|lighted in War, the Time and Place were appointed for treating a general Peace; her Allies, e&s;pecially the <HI>States,</HI> had by their ready concurrence expre&s;&s;ed an entire Con&s;idence in her; and &s;he promi&s;ed, to do her utmo&s;t to procure rea&s;onable &s;atisfaction to them all: She demanded of the Hou&s;e of Commons the ne|ce&s;&s;ary Supplies, for carrying on the War; and hoped that none would envy her the Glory of ending it by a ju&s;t and honourable Peace; &s;he in particular recommended Unanimity, that our Ene|mies might not think us a divided People, which might prevent that good Peace, of which &s;he had &s;uch rea&s;onable Hopes, and &s;o near a View.</P>
<P>The Speech gave occa&s;ion to many Reflections; <HI>The Arts of</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections on it.</NOTE> <HI>tho&s;e who delighted in War</HI> &s;eemed to be levelled at the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> and the Preliminaries concerted at the <HI>Hague;</HI> her &s;aying, that the Allies repo&s;ed an entire Confidence in her, amazed all tho&s;e who knew, that neither the Emperor nor the Empire had agreed to the Congre&s;s, but were oppo&s;ing it with great Vehemence; and that even the <HI>States</HI> were far from being cordial or ea&s;y, in the &s;teps that they had made.</P>
<P>After the Speech, a Motion was made in the Hou&s;e of Lords, <NOTE PLACE="marg">$arl of <HI>Not|$span$</HI> $word$. $word$, that $o Peace could be $word$, un$span$ <HI>Spain</HI> and the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> $word$ taken from the Hou&s;e of <HI>$word$.</HI></NOTE> to make an Addre&s;s of Thanks to the Queen for her Speech; upon this, the Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI> did very copiou&s;ly &s;$t forth the nece&s;&s;ity of having <HI>Spain</HI> and the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> out of the hands of a Prince of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon;</HI> he moved that, with their Addre&s;s of Thanks, they &s;hould offer that as their Advice to the Queen; he &s;et forth the Mi&s;ery that all <HI>Europe,</HI> but <HI>England</HI> mo&s;t particularly, mu&s;t be under, if the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> came into a <HI>French</HI> Management; and that King <HI>Philip</HI>'s po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them was, upon the Matter, the putting them into the hands of <HI>France.</HI> This was much oppo&s;ed by the Mini&s;ters; they moved the re|ferring that Matter to another occa&s;ion, in which it might be fully debated; but &s;aid, it was not &s;it to clog the Addre&s;s with it. Some officious Courtiers &s;aid, that &s;ince Peace and War be|longed,
<PB N="584" REF="612">
as Prerogatives to the Crown, it was not proper to offer any Advice in tho&s;e Matters, 'till it was asked: But this was re|jected with Indignation, &s;ince it was a con&s;tant Practice in all Se&s;&s;ions of Parliament, to offer Advices; no Prerogative could be above Advice; this was the end &s;pecified in the Writ, by which a Parliament was &s;ummoned; nor was the Motion for a Delay re|ceived. The Eyes of all <HI>Europe</HI> were upon the pre&s;ent Se&s;&s;ion; and this was a Po&s;t-Night: So it was fit they &s;hould come to a pre&s;ent Re&s;olution, in a matter of &s;uch importance. The Que&s;|tion <NOTE PLACE="marg">Agreed to by the Lords.</NOTE> was put, whether this Advice &s;hould be part of the Addre&s;s; and the previous Que&s;tion being fir&s;t put, it was carried by one Voice to put it; and the main Que&s;tion was carried by three Voices: &s;o this Point was gained, tho' by a &s;mall Majority. The &s;ame Motion was made in the Hou&s;e of Commons, but was re|jected by a great Majority; yet in other re&s;pects their Addre&s;s was well couched: for they &s;aid, they hoped for a ju&s;t, honourable, and la&s;ting Peace, to her Maje&s;ty and to all her Allies.</P>
<P>When the Addre&s;s of the Lords was reported to the Hou&s;e, by the Committee appointed to prepare it, the Court tried to get the whole matter to be conte&s;ted over again, pretending that the De|bate was not now, upon the matter, debated the day before, but only whether they &s;hould agree to the Draught, prepared by the Committee: But that part of it, which contained the Advice, was conceived in the very Words, in which the Vote had pa&s;s'd; and it was a &s;tanding Rule, that what was once voted, could never again be brought into que&s;tion, during that Se&s;&s;ion. This was &s;o &s;acred a Rule, that many of tho&s;e, who voted with the Court the Day before, expre&s;&s;ed their Indignation again&s;t it, as &s;ubverting the very Con&s;titution of Parliaments, if things might be thus voted and unvoted again, from day to day: Yet even upon this a Divi|&s;ion was called for, but the Majority appearing &s;o evidently again&s;t the Motion, it was yielded, without counting the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>When the Addre&s;s was pre&s;ented to the Queen, her An&s;wer was; &s;he was &s;orry, that any &s;hould think, &s;he would not do her <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen's $word$.</NOTE> utmo&s;t to hinder <HI>Spain</HI> and the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> from remaining in the hands of a Prince of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon:</HI> And the Lords returned her Thanks for this gracious An&s;wer; for they under|&s;tood, by the doing her utmo&s;t, was meant the continuing the War. The Court was much troubled to &s;ee the Hou&s;e of Lords &s;o backward; and both &s;ides &s;tudied to fortify them&s;elves, by bringing up their Friends, or by getting their Proxies.</P>
<P>The next Motion was made by the Earl of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> for leave to bring in a Bill again&s;t Occa&s;ional Conformity: He told <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Bill again&s;t Occa&s;ional Confor|$word$.</NOTE> tho&s;e, with whom he now joined, that he was but One Man come
<PB N="585" REF="613">
over to them, unle&s;s he could carry a Bill to that effect; but, if they would give way to that, he hoped he &s;hould be able to bring many to concur with them in other things. They yielded this the more ea&s;ily, becau&s;e they knew that the Court had of|fered, to the high Men in the Hou&s;e of Commons, to carry any Bill that they &s;hould de&s;ire in that Matter: The Earl of <HI>Nottin|gham</HI> promi&s;ed to draw it with all po&s;&s;ible Temper. It was thus prepared; that all Per&s;ons in Places of Profit and Tru&s;t, and all the Common-Council Men in Corporations, who &s;hould be at any Meeting for Divine Wor&s;hip (where there were above ten Per&s;ons, more than the Family) in which the Common Prayer was not u&s;ed, or where the Queen and the Prince&s;s <HI>Sophia</HI> were not prayed for, &s;hould upon Conviction forfeit their Place of Tru&s;t or Profit, the Witne&s;&s;es making Oath within ten Days, and the Pro&s;ecution being within three Months after the Offence; and &s;uch Per&s;ons were to continue incapable of any Imployment, 'till they &s;hould depo&s;e, that for a whole Year together they had been at no Conventicle. The Bill did al&s;o enact, that the Tole|ration &s;hould remain inviolable, in all time to come; and that if any Per&s;on &s;hould be brought into Trouble, for not having ob|&s;erved the Rules, that were pre&s;cribed by the Act that fir&s;t granted the Toleration, all &s;uch Pro&s;ecution &s;hould cea&s;e, upon their taking the Oath pre&s;cribed by that Act: And a Teacher, licen&s;ed in any one County, was by the Bill qualified, to &s;erve in any licen&s;ed Meeting in any Part of <HI>England;</HI> and by another Clau&s;e, all who were concerned in the Practice of the Law in <HI>Scotland</HI> were required to take the <HI>Abjuration,</HI> in the Month of <HI>June</HI> next.</P>
<P>No oppo&s;ition was made to this in the Hou&s;e of Lords; &s;o it <NOTE PLACE="marg">Pa&s;&s;ed with|out oppo&s;i|tion.</NOTE> pa&s;&s;ed in three Days; and it had the &s;ame fate in the Hou&s;e of Commons; only they added a Penalty on the Offender of forty Pounds, which was to be given to the Informer: and &s;o it was offered to the Royal A&s;&s;ent, with the Bill for four Shillings in the Pound. Great Reflections were made on the fate of this Bill, which had been formerly &s;o much conte&s;ted, and was &s;o often re|jected by the Lords, and now went thro' both Hou&s;es, in &s;o &s;ilent a manner, without the lea&s;t oppo&s;ition: Some of the Di&s;&s;enters complained much, that they were thus for&s;aken by their Friends, to whom they had tru&s;ted; and the Court had Agents among them, to inflame their Re&s;entments, &s;ince they were &s;acrificed by tho&s;e, on whom they depended. All the excu&s;e that the Whigs made, for their ea&s;ine&s;s in this Matter, was, That they gave way to it, to try how far the yielding it might go toward quiet|ing the Fears of tho&s;e, who &s;eemed to think the Church was &s;till
<PB N="586" REF="614">
in danger, 'till that Act pa&s;s'd; and thereby to engage the&s;e, to concur with them, in tho&s;e important Matters that might come before them. It mu&s;t be left to Time to &s;hew, what good effect this Act may have on the Church, or what bad ones it may have on Di&s;&s;enters.</P>
<P>The next point that occa&s;ioned a great Debate in the Hou&s;e of Lords, which was e&s;pou&s;ed by the Court with great Zeal, was a <NOTE PLACE="marg">Duke <HI>Ha|milton</HI>'s Pa|tent exa|mined.</NOTE> Patent creating Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> a Duke in <HI>England:</HI> Lawyers were heard for the Patent, the Queen's Prerogative in conferring Honours was clear; all the Subjects of the United Kingdom had likewi&s;e a Capacity of receiving Honour; the Commons of <HI>Scot|land</HI> had it unque&s;tionably; and it &s;eemed a &s;trange A&s;&s;ertion, that the Peers of that Nation &s;hould be the only Per&s;ons, incapa|ble of receiving Honour: By the Act of Union the Peers of <HI>Scot|land</HI> were, <HI>by virtue of that Treaty,</HI> to have a Repre&s;entation of Sixteen, for their whole Body; the&s;e Words, <HI>by virtue of that Treaty,</HI> &s;eemed to intimate, that by Creation or Succe&s;&s;ion they might be made capable. And, in the Debate that followed in the Hou&s;e, the <HI>Scotch</HI> Lords, who had been of the Treaty, af|firmed that the&s;e Words were put in on that de&s;ign: And upon this, they appealed to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Lords: This was denied by none of them. It was al&s;o urged, that the Hou&s;e of Lords had already judged the Matter, when they not only received the Duke of <HI>Queensbury,</HI> upon his being created Duke of <HI>Dover;</HI> but had &s;o far affirmed his being a Peer of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> that upon that account, they had denied him the Right of Voting in the Election of the Sixteen Peers of <HI>Scotland.</HI> But in oppo&s;ition to all this, it was &s;aid, That the Prerogative could not operate when it was barred by an Act of Parliament; the Act of Union had made all the Peers of <HI>Scotland,</HI> Peers of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> as to all Intents, except the Voting in the Hou&s;e of Lords, or &s;itting in Judgment on a Peer; and as to their Voting, that was ve&s;ted in their Repre&s;entatives, by whom they voted: The Queen might give them what Titles &s;he plea&s;ed; but this Incapacity of Voting, otherwi&s;e than by the&s;e Sixteen, being &s;ettled by Law, the Pre|rogative was by that limited as to them: They had indeed ad|mitted the Duke of <HI>Queensbury</HI> to &s;it among them, as Duke of <HI>Dover;</HI> but that Matter was never brought into debate; &s;o it was only pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence: And he was mentioned in their $span$ks, upon the occa&s;ion of his voting in the Choice of the Six|$span$ Peers of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in Terms that were far from determining $word$; for it was there &s;aid, that he claiming to be Duke of <HI>Dover,</HI> could not vote as a <HI>Scotch</HI> Peer. The <HI>Scotch</HI> Lords in&s;i&s;ted, in ar|guing for the Patent, with great vehemence, not without Inti|mations
<PB N="587" REF="615">
of the di&s;mal Effects, that might follow, if it &s;hould go in the Negative. The Court put their whole Strength to &s;upport the Patent; this heightened the Zeal of tho&s;e, who oppo&s;ed it: For they apprehended, that con&s;idering the Dignity and the An|tiquity of the <HI>Scotch</HI> Peers, and the Poverty of the greater part of them, the Court would always have recour&s;e to this, as a &s;ure Expedient to have a con&s;tant Majority in the Hou&s;e of Lords. There was no limitation indeed on the Prerogative, as to the Creation of new Peers, yet the&s;e were generally Men of E&s;tates, who could not be kept in a con&s;tant dependance, as &s;ome of the <HI>Scotch</HI> Lords might be.</P>
<P>The Queen heard all the Debate, which la&s;ted &s;ome Hours; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Judged a|gain&s;t him.</NOTE> in conclu&s;ion, when it came to the final Vote, fifty-two voted for the Patent, and fifty-&s;even again&s;t it. The Queen and the Mi|ni&s;ters &s;eemed to be much concerned at this, and the <HI>Scotch</HI> were enraged at it: They met together, and &s;igned a Repre&s;entation to the Queen, complaining of it as a Breach of the Union, and a Mark of Di&s;grace put on the whole Peers of <HI>Scotland,</HI> adding &s;olemn Promi&s;es of maintaining her Prerogative, either in an united or &s;eparated State. This made the Mini&s;ters re&s;olve on another Method to let the Peers, and indeed the whole World &s;ee, that they would have that Hou&s;e kept in a con&s;tant de|pendance on the Court, by creating &s;uch a number of Peers at once, as &s;hould give them an unque&s;tionable Majority. On the twenty-&s;econd of <HI>December</HI> the Bill for four Shillings in the Pound was ready for the Royal A&s;&s;ent; yet the Hou&s;e of Com|mons adjourned to the fourteenth of <HI>January,</HI> which was a long Rece&s;s in &s;o critical a time.</P>
<P>A Motion was made in the Hou&s;e of Lords, by the Duke of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lords Addre&s;s that our Allies might be carried along with us in the $span$y.</NOTE> <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> for leave to bring in a Bill, to give the Prince Elec|toral of <HI>Hanover,</HI> as Duke of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> the Precedence of all Peers; this was granted, and &s;o was like to meet with no oppo|&s;ition. The Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI> moved next, that before their Rece&s;s, they &s;hould make an Addre&s;s to the Queen, de&s;iring her to order her Plenipotentiaries to concert, with the Mini&s;ters of the Allies, the Grounds upon which they were to proceed in their Treaties, and to agree on a mutual Guaranty to &s;ecure them to us, as well as to all <HI>Europe,</HI> and in particular to &s;ecure the Pro|te&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion to <HI>England.</HI> All the oppo&s;ition that the Court made to this was, to &s;hew it was needle&s;s, for it was already or|dered: And the Lord Trea&s;urer &s;aid, the Lords might, in order to their &s;atisfaction, &s;end to examine their In&s;tructions. To this it was an&s;wered, that the offering &s;uch an Addre&s;s would &s;ortify the Plenipotentiaries, in executing their In&s;tructions. The Court

<P>But a new Scene was ready to be opened in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons; the Commi&s;&s;ioners for examining the Publick Accounts <NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;coveries of Bribery Pretended.</NOTE> made &s;ome Di&s;coveries, upon which they intended to proceed, at their next Meeting. <HI>Walpole,</HI> who had been Secretary of War, and who had appeared with great Firmne&s;s in the defence of the late Mini&s;try, was fir&s;t aimed at; a Bill had been remitted to him of 500 <HI>l.</HI> by tho&s;e who had contracted to forage the Troops, that lay in <HI>Scotland;</HI> this made way to a Matter of more Importance: A <HI>Jew,</HI> concerned in the Contract for furni&s;hing Bread to the Army in <HI>Flanders,</HI> made a Pre&s;ent yearly to the Duke of <HI>Marl|borough</HI> of between 5 and 6000 <HI>l.</HI> The General of the <HI>States</HI> had the like Pre&s;ent, as a Perqui&s;ite to &s;upport his Dignity, and to enable him to procure Intelligence: The Queen ordered 10000 <HI>l.</HI> a-year more to the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> for the &s;ame Service: The late King had al&s;o agreed, that Two and a half <HI>per Cent.</HI> &s;hould be deducted out of the Pay of the foreign Troops, which amounted to 15000 <HI>l.</HI> This the Queen had by a Warrant appointed the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> to receive, on the &s;ame account.</P>
<P>He heard his Enemies had di&s;covered the Pre&s;ent, made him by <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of <HI>Marlbo|rough</HI> armed at.</NOTE> the <HI>Jew,</HI> while he was beyond Sea; &s;o he wrote to them, and owned the whole Matter to be true, and added, that he had ap|plied the&s;e Sums to the procuring good Intelligence, to which, next to the Ble&s;&s;ing of God and the Bravery of the Troops, their con|&s;tant Succe&s;&s;es were chiefly owing. This did not &s;atisfy the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners; but, tho' no Complaints were brought from the Army, of their not being con&s;tantly &s;upplied with good Bread, yet they &s;aw here was Matter to rai&s;e a Clamour, which they chiefly aimed at; &s;o this was reported to the Hou&s;e of Commons before their Rece&s;s.</P>
<P>A few Days after this, the Queen wrote him a Letter, complain|ing of the ill Treatment &s;he received from him, and di&s;charged <NOTE PLACE="marg">He is turned out of all his Imploy|ments.</NOTE> him of all his Imployments: This was thought very extraordinary, after &s;uch long and eminent Services; &s;uch Accidents, when they happen, &s;hew the In&s;tability of all human things; this was indeed &s;o little expected, that tho&s;e who looked for Precedents, could find none &s;ince the Di&s;grace of <HI>Beli&s;arius</HI> in <HI>Ju&s;tinian</HI>'s time: The only thing pretended to excu&s;e it was, his being con&s;idered as the Head of tho&s;e, who oppo&s;ed the Peace, on which the Court &s;eemed to &s;et their Hearts.</P>
<P>But they, finding the Majority of the Hou&s;e of Lords could not <NOTE PLACE="marg">Twelve new $word$ made</NOTE> be brought to favour their De&s;igns, re&s;olved to make an Experiment,
<PB N="589" REF="617">
that none of our Princes had ventured on in former times: A Re&s;olution was taken up very &s;uddenly of making twelve Peers all at once; three of the&s;e were called up by Writ, being elde&s;t Sons of Peers; and nine more were created by Patent. Sir <HI>Miles Wharton,</HI> to whom it was offered, refu&s;ed it: He thought it looked like the &s;erving a Turn; and that, whereas Peers were wont to be made for Services they had done, he would be made for Serviors to be done by him; &s;o he excu&s;ed him&s;elf, and the Favourite's Husband, Mr. <HI>Ma&s;&s;am,</HI> was put in his room. And whereas formerly <HI>Jefferies</HI> had the Vanity to be made a Peer, while he was Chief Ju&s;tice, which had not been practi&s;ed for &s;ome Ages; yet the Precedent &s;et by him was followed, and <HI>Trevor,</HI> Chief Ju&s;tice of the Common Pleas, was now advanced to be a Peer. This was looked upon as an undoubted part of the Prerogative; &s;o there was no ground in Law to oppo&s;e the re|ceiving the new Lords into the Hou&s;e: Nor was it po&s;&s;ible to rai&s;e, in the ancient Peers, a &s;en&s;e of the Indignity that was now put upon their Hou&s;e; &s;ince the Court did by this openly de|clare, that they were to be kept in ab&s;olute Submi&s;&s;ion and Obedience.</P>
<P>When the &s;econd of <HI>January</HI> came, they were all introduced <NOTE PLACE="marg">1712. The Queen's Me&s;&s;age to the Lords to adjourn, di&s;puted, but obeyed.</NOTE> into the Hou&s;e of Lords without any oppo&s;ition; and when that was over, the Lord Keeper delivered a Me&s;&s;age from the Queen, commanding them to adjourn forthwith to the fourteenth; for by that time her Maje&s;ty would lay Matters of great Impor|tance before the two Hou&s;es. Upon this a great Debate aro&s;e; it was &s;aid, that the Queen could not &s;end a Me&s;&s;age to any one Hou&s;e to adjourn, when the like Me&s;&s;age was not &s;ent to both Hou&s;es: the Plea&s;ure of the Prince, in convening, di&s;&s;olving, proroguing, or ordering the Adjournment of Parliaments, was always directed to both Hou&s;es; but never to any one Hou&s;e, without the &s;ame Intimation was made, at the &s;ame time, to the other. The con&s;e|quence of this, if allowed, might be the ordering one Hou&s;e to adjourn, while the other was left to &s;it &s;till; and this might end in a total disjointing of the Con&s;titution: The Vote was carried for adjourning, by the weight of the twelve new Peers. It is true, the Odds in the Books is thirteen; but that was, becau&s;e one of the Peers, who had a Proxy, without reflecting on it, went away when the Proxies were called for.</P>
<P>At this time Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> was &s;ent by the Emperor to <HI>Eng|land,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince <HI>Eu|gene</HI> came to <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> to try if it was po&s;&s;ible to engage our Court, to go on with the War; offering a new Scheme, by which he took a much larger &s;hare of it on him&s;elf, than the late Emperor would bear.
<PB N="590" REF="618">
That Prince's Character was &s;o ju&s;tly high, that all People for &s;ome Weeks pre&s;&s;ed about the Places, where he was to be &s;een, to look on him; I had the honour to be admitted at &s;everal times, to much di&s;cour&s;e with him; his Character is &s;o uni|ver&s;ally known, that I will &s;ay nothing of him, but from what appeared to my&s;elf. He has a mo&s;t unaffected Mode&s;ty, and does &s;carcely bear the Acknowledgments, that all the World pay him: He de&s;cends to an ea&s;y Equality with tho&s;e, with whom he conver&s;es; and &s;eems to a&s;&s;ume nothing to him&s;elf, while he rea&s;ons with others: He was treated with great re&s;pect by both Parties; but he put a di&s;tingui&s;hed Re&s;pect on the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> with whom he pa&s;&s;ed mo&s;t of his Time. The Queen u&s;ed him civilly, but not with the Di&s;tinction, that was due to his high Merit: Nor did he gain much ground with the Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>When the fourteenth of <HI>January</HI> came, the Hou&s;es were or|dered <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Me&s;&s;age to both Hou&s;es.</NOTE> to adjourn to the eighteenth, and then a Me&s;&s;age was &s;ent to both Hou&s;es; the Queen told them, the Congre&s;s was opened, and that &s;he would &s;et a day for ending it, as well as &s;he had done for opening it. She had ordered her Plenipotentiaries, to agree with the Mini&s;ters of her Allies, according to all her Treaties with them; to obtain rea&s;onable &s;atisfaction to their Demands; in particular concerning <HI>Spain</HI> and the <HI>We&s;t Indies;</HI> by which, the fal&s;e Reports of ill-de&s;igning Men, who, for evil ends, had reported that a &s;eparate Peace was treated, would appear, for there was never the lea&s;t Colour given for this. She al&s;o pro|mi&s;ed, that the Articles of the Treaty &s;hould be laid before the Hou&s;es, before any thing &s;hould be concluded. Upon this, the Hou&s;e of Lords agreed to an Addre&s;s, thanking her Maje&s;ty, for communicating this to them, and for the Promi&s;es &s;he had made them, repeating the Words in which they were made: it was moved to add the Words, <HI>Conform to her Alliance;</HI> but it was &s;aid, the Queen a&s;&s;ured them of that, &s;o the repeating the&s;e Words &s;eemed to intimate a Di&s;tru&s;t; and that was not carried. But, becau&s;e there &s;eemed to be an Ambiguity in the mention made of <HI>Spain</HI> and the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> the Hou&s;e expre&s;&s;ed, in what &s;en&s;e they under&s;tood them, by adding the&s;e Words, <HI>Which were of the greate&s;t importance to the Safety and Commerce of the&s;e Na|tions.</HI> The Commons made an Addre&s;s to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, in which they only named <HI>Spain</HI> and the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI></P>
<P>The Lord Trea&s;urer prevented the Duke of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> who had prepared a Bill for giving Precedence to the Duke of <HI>Cam|bridge;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Bill giving Precedence to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover.</HI></NOTE> for he offered a Bill, giving Precedence to the whole Electoral Family, as the Children and Nephews of the Crown;
<PB N="591" REF="619">
and it was intimated, that Bills relating to Honours and Prece|dence ought to come from the Crown: The Duke of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> would make no di&s;pute on this head; if the thing pa&s;&s;ed, he ac|quie&s;ced in the manner of pa&s;&s;ing it, only he thought it lay within the Authority of the Hou&s;e. On this occa&s;ion, the Court &s;eemed, even to an Affectation, to &s;hew a particular Zeal in promoting this Bill: For it pa&s;&s;ed thro' both Hou&s;es in two Days, it being read thrice in a Day, in them both. For all this ha&s;te, the Court did not &s;eem to de&s;ign any &s;uch Bill, till it was propo&s;ed by others, out of who&s;e hands they thought fit to take it. There were two other Articles, in the Queen's Me&s;&s;age; by the one, &s;he de&s;ired their Advice and A&s;&s;i&s;tance, to quiet the Unea&s;ine&s;s, that the Peers of <HI>Scotland</HI> were under, by the Judgment lately given: By the other, &s;he complained of the Licence of the Pre&s;s, and de&s;ired &s;ome Re&s;traint might be put upon it. The Lords entred upon the Con&s;ideration of that part of the Queen's Me&s;&s;age, that related <NOTE PLACE="marg">Debates concerning the <HI>Scotch</HI> Peers.</NOTE> to the Peers of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and it took up almo&s;t a whole Week. The Court propo&s;ed, that an Expedient might be found, that the Peers of <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hould not &s;it among them by Election, but by De&s;cent, in ca&s;e the re&s;t of the Peers of that Nation &s;hould con&s;ent to it: A Debate followed concerning the Articles of the Union, which of them were fundamental and not alterable; it was &s;aid, that by the Union no private Right could be taken away, but by the Con&s;ent of the Per&s;ons concerned; therefore no Alteration could be made in the Right of the Peers of <HI>Scot|land,</HI> unle&s;s they con&s;ented to it. It was afterwards debated, whether an Alteration might be made with this condition, in ca&s;e they &s;hould con&s;ent to it; or whether the fir&s;t Ri&s;e to any &s;uch Alteration ought not to be given, by a previous De&s;ire. This was not &s;o &s;ubject to an ill Management; the Court &s;tudied to have a &s;ub&s;equent Con&s;ent received as &s;ufficient; but a previous De&s;ire was in&s;i&s;ted on, as vi&s;ibly fairer and ju&s;ter.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of Commons, after the Rece&s;s, entred on the Ob|&s;ervations <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Walpole</HI>'s Ca&s;e and Cen&s;ure.</NOTE> of the Commi&s;&s;ioners for taking the Publick Accounts; and began with <HI>Walpole,</HI> whom they re&s;olved to put out of the way of di&s;turbing them in the Hou&s;e. The thing laid to his charge &s;tood thus; after he, as Secretary of War, had contracted with &s;ome for Forrage to the Hor&s;e, that lay in <HI>Scotland;</HI> he, find|ing that the two Per&s;ons who contracted for it made &s;ome gain by it, named a Friend of his own as a third Per&s;on, that he might have a &s;hare in the Gain; but the other two had no mind to let him in, to know the Secret of their Management; &s;o they offered him 500 <HI>l.</HI> for his Share; he accepted of it, and the Money was remitted. But they, not knowing his Addre&s;s, directed their
<PB N="592" REF="620">
Bill to <HI>Walpole,</HI> who endor&s;ed it, and the Per&s;on concerned re|ceived the Money; this was found out, and <HI>Walpole</HI> was charged with it as a Bribe, that he had taken for his own u&s;e, for making the Contract. Both the Per&s;ons that remitted the Money, and he who received it were examined, and affirmed that <HI>Walpole</HI> was neither directly nor indirectly concerned in the Matter; but the Hou&s;e in&s;i&s;ted upon his having endor&s;ed the Bill, and not only voted this a Corruption, but &s;ent him to the Tower, and ex|pelled him the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The next Attack was on the Duke of <HI>Marlborough:</HI> The Money <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cen|&s;ure put on the Duke of <HI>Marlbo|rough.</HI></NOTE> received from the <HI>Jew,</HI> was &s;aid to be a Fraud; and that, deducted out of the Pay of the Foreign Troops, was &s;aid to be Publick Mo|ney, and to be accounted for: The Debate held long; it appeared, that during the former War, King <HI>William</HI> had 50000 <HI>l.</HI> a-year for Contingencies; it was often reckoned to have co&s;t much more. The Contingency was that Service, which could be brought to no certain head, and was chiefly for procuring Intelligence; the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> had only 10000 <HI>l.</HI> for the Contingencies; that and all the other <HI>Items</HI> joined together, amounted but to 30000 <HI>l.</HI> a Sum much inferiour to what had been formerly given; and yet, with this moderate Expence, he had procured &s;o good Intelligence, that he was never &s;urprized, and no Party he &s;ent out was ever intercepted or cut off. By means of this Intelligence, all his De|&s;igns were &s;o well concerted, that he &s;ucceeded in every one of them, and by many In&s;tances, the exactne&s;s of his Intelligence was fully demon&s;trated. It was proved, both by Witne&s;&s;es, and by for|mal Atte&s;tations from <HI>Holland,</HI> that ever &s;ince the Year 1672, the <HI>Jews</HI> had made the like Pre&s;ent to the General of the <HI>States</HI> Army; and it was under&s;tood as a Perqui&s;ite belonging to that Command: No Bargain was made with the <HI>Jews</HI> for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Troops, that made by the <HI>States</HI> being applied to them; &s;o that it appeared, that the making &s;uch a Pre&s;ent to the General was cu&s;tomary; but that was denied: And they voted, the taking that Pre&s;ent to be illegal; and, tho' he had the Queen's Warrant to receive the Sixpence in the Pound, or Two and a half <HI>per Cent.</HI> deducted from the Pay of the Foreign Troops, yet that was voted to be unwarrantable, and that it ought to be accounted for. The Court e&s;pou&s;ed this with &s;uch Zeal, and paid &s;o well for it, that it was carried by a great Majority: Upon this, many virulent Wri|ters (whether &s;et on to it, or officiou&s;ly &s;tudying to merit by it, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Many Labels again&s;t him</NOTE> did not appear) threw out, in many defamatory Libels, a great deal of their Malice again&s;t the Duke of <HI>Marlborough:</HI> They compared him to <HI>Catiline,</HI> to <HI>Cra&s;&s;us,</HI> and to <HI>Anthony;</HI> and &s;tu|died to repre&s;ent him as a Robber of the Nation, and as a publick

Enemy. This gave an Indignation to all, who had a &s;en&s;e of Gratitude, or a regard to Ju&s;tice; in one of the&s;e &s;currilous Pa|pers, wrote on de&s;ign to rai&s;e the Rabble again&s;t him, one of the Periods began thus, <HI>He was perhaps once fortunate.</HI> I took occa|&s;ion to let Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> &s;ee the Spite of the&s;e Writers, and men|tioned this Pa&s;&s;age; upon which he made this plea&s;ant Reflec|tion, That it was the greate&s;t Commendation could be given him, &s;ince he was always &s;ucce&s;sful; &s;o this implied, that in one &s;ingle In&s;tance he might be fortunate, but that all his other Succe&s;&s;es were owing to his Conduct. I upon that &s;aid, that &s;ingle In&s;tance mu&s;t be then his e&s;caping out of the hands of the Party, that took him, when he was &s;ailing down the <HI>Mae&s;e</HI> in the Boat. But their Ill-Will re&s;ted not in Defamation; the Queen was prevailed on to &s;end an Order to the Attorney-General, to pro&s;ecute him for the 15000 <HI>l.</HI> that was deducted yearly out of the Pay of the Foreign Troops, which he had received by her own Warrant: But what this will end in, mu&s;t be le&s;t to Time.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> was declared General, and had the fir&s;t Regiment of Guards; and the Earl of <HI>Rivers</HI> was made Ma&s;ter of the Ordnance, in his room.</P>
<P>Secret Enquiries were made, in order to the laying more Load <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Inno|cence ap|peared evi|dently.</NOTE> on the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> and to &s;ee whether Po&s;ts in the Army, or in the Guards were &s;old by him; but nothing could be found: He had &s;uffered a Practice to go on, that had been begun in the late King's time, of letting Officers &s;ell their Commi&s;&s;ions; but he had never taken any part of the Price to him&s;elf: Few thought that he had been &s;o clear in that Matter; for it was the only thing, in which now his Enemies were confident, that &s;ome Di&s;coveries would have been made to his prejudice; &s;o that the Endeavours u&s;ed, to &s;earch into tho&s;e Matters, producing no|thing, rai&s;ed the Reputation of his incorrupt Admini&s;tration, more than all his Well-wi&s;hers could have expected. Thus happy does &s;ometimes the Malice of an Enemy prove! In this whole Tran&s;action we &s;aw a new Scene of Ingratitude, acted in a mo&s;t imprudent manner; when the Man, to whom the Nation owed more, than it had ever done in any Age to any Subject, or per|haps to any Per&s;on what&s;oever, was for &s;ome Months pur&s;ued with &s;o much Malice: He bore it with Silence and Patience, with an Exteriour that &s;eemed always calm and cheerful; and, tho' he prepared a full Vindication of him&s;elf, yet he delayed publi&s;hing it, 'till the Nation &s;hould return to its Sen&s;es, and be capable of examining the&s;e Matters, in a more impartial manner.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scotch</HI> Lords, &s;eeing no Redre&s;s to their Complaint, &s;eemed <NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Scotch</HI> Lords put in good Hopes.</NOTE> re&s;olved to come no more to &s;it in the Hou&s;e of Peers; but the
<PB N="594" REF="622">
Court was &s;en&s;ible, that their Strength in that Hou&s;e con&s;i&s;ted chiefly in them, and in the new Peers: So Pains were taken, and &s;ecret forcible Arguments were u&s;ed to them, which proved &s;o effectual, that after a few days Ab&s;ence, they came back, and continued, during the Se&s;&s;ion, to &s;it in the Hou&s;e. They gave it out, that an Expedient would be found, that would be to the &s;a|tisfaction of the Peers of <HI>Scotland:</HI> But, nothing of that appear|ing, it was concluded that the Satisfaction was private, and per|&s;onal. The great Arrear, into which all the regular Payments, both of the Hou&s;hold and of Salaries and Pen&s;ions was left to run, made it to be generally believed, that the Income for the Civil Li&s;t, tho' it exceeded the E&s;tabli&s;hment very far, was ap|plied to other Payments, which the Mini&s;ters dur&s;t not own. And, tho' &s;ecret Practice on Members had been of a great while too common, yet it was believed, that it was at this time ma|naged, with an extraordinary Profu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e, who were &s;u&s;pected to have very bad De&s;igns, applied them&s;elves with great indu&s;try to drive on &s;uch Bills, as they hoped would give the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;uch Alarms, as might di&s;po&s;e them to remon&s;trate, that the Union was broken. They pa&s;&s;ed not all at once; but I &s;hall lay them together, be|cau&s;e one and the &s;ame De&s;ign was pur&s;ued in them all.</P>
<P>A Toleration was propo&s;ed for the Epi&s;copal Clergy, who <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Toleration to the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Liturgy in <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> would u&s;e the Liturgy of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> this &s;eemed &s;o rea&s;onable, that no oppo&s;ition was made to it: one Clau&s;e put in it, occa&s;ioned great Complaints; the Magi&s;trates, who by the Laws were obliged to execute the Sentences of the Judicatories of their <HI>Kirk,</HI> were by this Act required, to execute none of them. It was rea&s;onable to require them to execute no Sentences, that might be pa&s;&s;ed on any, for doing what was tolerated by this Act; but the carrying this to a general Clau&s;e, took away the Civil Sanction, which in mo&s;t Places is looked on as the chief, if not the only, Strength of Church Power. Tho&s;e, who were to be thus Tolerated, were required, by a Day limited in the Act, to take the Oath of Abjuration; it was well known, that few, if any of them, would take that Oath; &s;o to cover them from it, a Clau&s;e was put in this Act, requiring all the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Mi|ni&s;ters <NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;igns to provoke the <HI>Presbyte|rians</HI> there.</NOTE> to take it; &s;ince it &s;eemed rea&s;onable, that tho&s;e of the legal E&s;tabli&s;hment &s;hould be required to take that, which was now to be impo&s;ed on Tho&s;e, who were only to be Tolerated. It was well under&s;tood, that there were Words in the Oath of Abju|ration, to which the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> excepted. In the Act of Succe&s;|&s;ion, one of the Conditions on which the Succe&s;&s;or was to be received, was, his being of the Communion of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> and
<PB N="595" REF="623">
by the Oath of Abjuration, the Succe&s;&s;ion was &s;worn to, as limited by that Act: The Word <HI>Limitation</HI> imported only the Entail of the Crown; but it was &s;ugge&s;ted, that the Particle <HI>As,</HI> related to all the Conditions in that Act. This was &s;pread among &s;o many of that Per&s;ua&s;ion, that it was believed a great Party among them, would refu&s;e to take it: So a &s;mall Alteration was made by the Hou&s;e of Lords of the&s;e Words, <HI>As was limited,</HI> into Words of the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, <HI>Which was limited;</HI> but tho&s;e, who intended to excu&s;e the Epi&s;copal Party, who they knew were in the <HI>Pre|tender</HI>'s Intere&s;ts, from taking the Oath, were for keeping in tho&s;e Words, which the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> &s;crupled. The Commons accordingly di&s;agreed to the Amendment made by the Lords; and they receding from it, the Bill pa&s;s'd, as it had been &s;ent up from the Commons. Another Act pa&s;&s;ed for di&s;continuing the Courts of Judicature, during &s;ome Days at <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> though the ob&s;erving of Holidays was contrary to their Principles: This was intended only to irritate them.</P>
<P>After that, an Act was brought in, for the re&s;toring of Patro|nages; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Patronages re&s;tored.</NOTE> the&s;e had been taken away by an Act in King <HI>William</HI>'s Reign; it was &s;et up by the <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> from their fir&s;t Be|ginning, as a Principle, that Pari&s;hes had, from Warrants in Scripture, a Right to chu&s;e their Mini&s;ters; &s;o that they had al|ways look'd on the Right of Patronage, as an Inva&s;ion made on that: it was therefore urged, that &s;ince, by the Act of Union, <HI>Presbytery,</HI> with all its Rights and Privileges, was inalterably &s;e|cured, and &s;ince their Kirk-Se&s;&s;ion was a Branch of their Con|&s;titution, the taking from them the Right of chu&s;ing their Mini&s;ters was contrary to that Act: Yet the Bill pa&s;&s;ed thro' both Hou&s;es, a &s;mall oppo&s;ition being only made in either. By the&s;e Steps the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> were alarmed, when they &s;aw the Succe&s;s of every Motion that was made, on de&s;ign to weaken and undermine their E&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>Another Matter, of a more publick nature, was at this time <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Battle Treaty.</NOTE> &s;et on foot; both Hou&s;es of Parliament had, in the Year 1709, agreed in an Addre&s;s to the Queen, that the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion might be &s;ecured by a Guaranty, in the Treaty of Peace; and this was &s;ettled at the <HI>Hague,</HI> to be one of the Preliminaries: But when an end was put to the Conferences at <HI>Gertruydenberg,</HI> the Lord <HI>Town&s;hend</HI> was ordered to &s;et on a Treaty with the <HI>States</HI> to that effect. They entertained it readily; but at the &s;ame time they propo&s;ed, that <HI>England</HI> &s;hould enter into a Guaranty with them, to maintain their Barrier; which con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ome Places they were to garri&s;on, the Sovereignty of which was &s;till in the Crown of <HI>Spain;</HI> and of other Places, which had not belonged
<PB N="596" REF="624">
to that Crown, at the Death of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, but had been taken in the Progre&s;s of the War: for, by their Agreements with us, they bore the Charge of the Sieges, and &s;o the Places taken were to belong to them: The&s;e were chiefly <HI>Li&s;le, Tournay, Menin,</HI> and <HI>Doway;</HI> and were to be kept &s;till by them. But as for tho&s;e Places, which, from the time of the Treaty of the <HI>Pyrenees,</HI> belonged to the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> they had been &s;o ill looked after, by the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Governours of <HI>Flanders,</HI> who were more &s;et on enriching them&s;elves, and keeping a mag|nificent Court at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> than on pre&s;erving the Country; that neither were the Fortifications kept in due Repair, nor the Maga|zines furni&s;hed, nor the Soldiers paid: So that when&s;oever a War broke out, the <HI>French</HI> made them&s;elves very ea&s;ily Ma&s;ters of Places &s;o ill kept. The <HI>States</HI> had therefore propo&s;ed, during this War, that the Sovereignty of tho&s;e Places &s;hould continue &s;till to belong to the Crown of <HI>Spain;</HI> but they &s;hould keep Garri|&s;ons in the &s;tronge&s;t and the mo&s;t expo&s;ed, in particular tho&s;e that lay on the <HI>Lys</HI> and the <HI>Scheld;</HI> and for the maintaining this, they asked 100000 <HI>l.</HI> a-year from tho&s;e Provinces; by which means they would be kept better and cheaper than ever they had been, while they were in the hands of the <HI>Spaniards:</HI> They al&s;o asked a free Pa&s;&s;age for all the Stores, that they &s;hould &s;end to tho&s;e Places. This &s;eemed to be &s;o rea&s;onable, that &s;ince the In|tere&s;t of <HI>England,</HI> as well as of the <HI>States,</HI> required that this Fron|tier &s;hould be carefully maintained, the Mini&s;try were ready to hearken to it: It was objected, that in ca&s;e of a War between <HI>England</HI> and the <HI>States,</HI> the Trade of tho&s;e Provinces would be wholly in the hands of the <HI>Dutch;</HI> but this had been &s;ettled in the great Truce, which, by the Mediation of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> was made between the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and the <HI>States:</HI> There was a provi&s;ional Order therein made, for the Freedom of Trade in tho&s;e Provinces; and that was turned to a perpetual one, by the Peace of <HI>Mun&s;ter.</HI> King <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> had agreed to the main of the Barrier; &s;ome Places on the <HI>Scheld</HI> were not nece&s;&s;ary for a Frontier, but the <HI>States</HI> in&s;i&s;ted on them, as nece&s;&s;ary to main|tain a Communication with the Frontier; the King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> excepted likewi&s;e to &s;ome Places in the <HI>Spani&s;h Guelder.</HI> The Lord <HI>Town&s;hend</HI> thought, that the&s;e were &s;uch incon&s;iderable Ob|jections, that tho' his In&s;tructions did not come up to every Par|ticular, yet he &s;igned the Treaty, known by the Name of the <HI>Barrier Treaty:</HI> By it the <HI>States</HI> bound them&s;elves to maintain the Queen's Title to her Dominions and the Prote&s;tant Suc|ce&s;&s;ion, with their whole Force; and <HI>England</HI> was reciprocally bound to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in maintaining this Barrier.</P>
<P><PB N="597" REF="625">
The mercenary Writers, that were hired to defend the Peace, then projected with <HI>France,</HI> attacked this Treaty with great Viru|lence, and by Arguments that gave ju&s;t Su&s;picions of black De|&s;igns: <NOTE PLACE="marg">It was com|plained of.</NOTE> They &s;aid, it was a Di&s;grace to this Nation, to engage any other State to &s;ecure the Succe&s;&s;ion among us, which perhaps we might &s;ee cau&s;e to alter: Whereas by this Treaty, the <HI>States</HI> had an Authority given them, to interpo&s;e in our Coun&s;els. It was al&s;o &s;aid, that if the <HI>States</HI> were put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all tho&s;e &s;trong Towns, they might &s;hut us out from any &s;hare of Trade in them, and might erect our Manufactures in Provinces, very ca|pable of them: But it was an&s;wered, that this could not be done, as long as this Treaty continued in force, unle&s;s the Sovereign of the Country &s;hould join with them again&s;t us. Some objected to the Settlement made at <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> as a Tran&s;action when we were in &s;uch Confu&s;ion at home, that we had no Mini&s;ter there; but that Treaty had only rendred the Truce, and the provi&s;ional Set|tlement made before, by the Mediation of <HI>England,</HI> perpetual; and we had &s;ince acquie&s;ced in that Settlement for above Sixty Years. By examining into the Particulars of the Treaty it ap|peared, that in &s;ome incon&s;iderable Matters the Lord <HI>Town&s;hend</HI> had gone beyond the Letter of his In&s;tructions, in which he had &s;o fully &s;atisfied the Mini&s;try, that tho' upon his fir&s;t &s;igning it, &s;ome Exceptions had been taken, yet the&s;e were pa&s;&s;ed over, and the Treaty was ratified in form.</P>
<P>But the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try had other Views: They de&s;igned to &s;et the Queen at liberty from her Engagements by the&s;e Alliances, and to di&s;engage her from Treaties. The Hou&s;e of Commons went now very ha&s;tily into &s;everal Re&s;olutions, that were very in|jurious to the <HI>States:</HI> They pretended, they had failed in the Performance of all Agreements, with relation to the Service, both at Sea and Land; and as to the Troops, that were to have been fur|ni&s;hed in <HI>Portugal</HI> and <HI>Savoy,</HI> as well as the Sub&s;idies due to tho&s;e Princes. They fell next on the <HI>Barrier Treaty;</HI> they gave it <NOTE PLACE="marg">And con|demned by the Hou&s;e of Lords</NOTE> out, that the old Mini&s;try de&s;igned to bring over an Army from <HI>Holland,</HI> when&s;oever they &s;hould, for other ends, pretend that the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion was in danger; and it was &s;aid, there was no need of any foreign A&s;&s;i&s;tance to maintain it. In the De|bate, it was in&s;i&s;ted on, that it could be maintained &s;a&s;ely no other way; it was not to be doubted, but the King of <HI>France</HI> would a&s;&s;i&s;t the <HI>Pretender; England</HI> was not inclined to keep up a Standing Army, in time of Peace, to re&s;i&s;t him: So that we could not be &s;o &s;a&s;e any other way, as by having the <HI>States</HI> en|gaged, to &s;end over their Army, if it &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary. But Rea&s;on is a feeble thing, to bear down Re&s;olutions already taken:
<PB N="598" REF="626">
&s;o the Hou&s;e of Commons voted the Treaty di&s;honourable, and injurious to <HI>England;</HI> and that the Lord <HI>Town&s;hend</HI> had gone be|yond his In&s;tructions in &s;igning it; and that he and all, who had advi&s;ed and ratified that Treaty, were publick Enemies to the Kingdom. The&s;e Votes were carried by a great Majority, and were looked on as &s;trange Preludes to a Peace. When the <HI>States</HI> heard, what Exceptions were taken to the <HI>Barrier Treaty;</HI> they wrote a very re&s;pectful Letter to the Queen, in which they offered to explain or mollify any part of it, that was wrong under&s;tood; but the Managers of the Hou&s;e of Commons got all their Votes to be dige&s;ted, into a well-compo&s;ed inflaming Repre&s;entation, which was laid before the Queen; by it all the Allies, but mo&s;t particu|larly the <HI>States,</HI> were charged for having failed in many Par|ticulars, contrary to their Engagements: They al&s;o laid before the Queen the Votes they had made, with relation to the <HI>Barrier Treaty;</HI> and that they might name a great Sum, that would make a deep Impre&s;&s;ion on the Nation (which was ready to receive all things implicitly from them) they &s;aid <HI>England</HI> had been, during the War, overcharged nineteen Millions, beyond what they ought to have paid; all which was ca&s;t on the old Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>The <HI>States,</HI> in an&s;wer to all this, drew up a large Memorial, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>States</HI> ju&s;tify them&s;elves.</NOTE> in which every Particular in the Repre&s;entation was examined, and fully an&s;wered: They &s;ent it over to their Envoy, who pre|&s;ented it to the Queen; but no notice was taken of it; the End was already &s;erved; and the entring into a Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion about it, could have no other effect, but to confound tho&s;e who drew it. The two fir&s;t Heads of the <HI>States</HI> Memorial, that related to the Service at Sea and in <HI>Flanders,</HI> were printed here, and con|tained a full An&s;wer to all that was charged on them, as to tho&s;e Matters; to the ample Conviction of all, who examined the Par|ticulars. The Hou&s;e of Commons &s;aw the effect this was like to have; &s;o they voted it a fal&s;e, malicious, &s;candalous, and injurious Paper, and that the printing it was a Breach of Privilege: And to &s;top the printing the other Heads, they put the Printer in pri&s;on; this was a Confutation, to which no Reply could be made; yet it &s;eemed to be a Confe&s;&s;ion, that their Repre&s;entation could not be ju&s;ti&s;ied, when the An&s;wer to it was &s;o carefully &s;tifled. The Hou&s;e of Commons went next to repeal the Naturalization Act, in which they met with no oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The &s;elf-denying Bill was brought into the Hou&s;e of Commons, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;elf|denying Bill $word$</NOTE> and, as was ordinary, it pa&s;&s;ed ea&s;ily there: the Scandal of Cor|ruption was now higher than ever; for it was believed Men were not only bribed for a whole Se&s;&s;ion, but had new Bribes for parti|cular Votes. The twelve new Peers being brought into the Hou&s;e
<PB N="599" REF="627">
of Lords, had irritated &s;o many there, that for two Days, by all the Judgments that could be made of the Hou&s;e, the Bill was likely to have pa&s;s'd that Hou&s;e: But upon &s;ome prevailing Argu|ments, &s;ecretly and dextrou&s;ly applied to &s;ome Lords, an Altera|tion was made in it, by which it was lo&s;t: For whereas the Bill, as it &s;tood, was to take place after the Determination of the pre|&s;ent Parliament, this was altered, &s;o as that it &s;hould take place after the Demi&s;e of the Queen; &s;o it was no more thought on.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of Commons voted two Millions to be rai&s;ed by a Lottery; for which a Fund was created that might pay both Prin|cipal and Intere&s;t in thirty-two Years.</P>
<P>I look next to <HI>Utrecht,</HI> where the Treaty was opened: The <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Treaty at <HI>Utrecht</HI> opened.</NOTE> Emperor and the Empire &s;ent their Mini&s;ters very late and unwil|lingly thither; but they &s;ubmitted to the Nece&s;&s;ity of their Af|fairs; yet with this Condition, that the <HI>French</HI> Propo&s;als (for &s;o the Propo&s;itions, that were formerly called Preliminaries, came to be named) &s;hould be no ground to proceed on; and that a new Treaty &s;hould be entred on, without any regard to them. It was al&s;o agreed, to &s;ave the lo&s;s of time in &s;ettling the Cere|monial, that the Plenipotentiaries &s;hould a&s;&s;ume no Character of Dignity, 'till all matters were adju&s;ted, and made ready for &s;ign|ing. The fir&s;t of <HI>January</HI> was the Day named for opening the Congre&s;s; but they waited &s;ome time for the Allies: In the be|ginning of <HI>February</HI> O. S. the <HI>French</HI> made their Propo&s;als in a very high &s;train.</P>
<P>They promi&s;ed, that at the &s;igning of the Treaty they would <NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>French</HI> Propo&s;als.</NOTE> own the Queen and the Succe&s;&s;ion to the Crown, as &s;he &s;hould direct; <HI>Spain</HI> and the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> were to remain with King <HI>Philip;</HI> the Dominions in <HI>Italy,</HI> with the I&s;lands, except <HI>Sicily,</HI> were to go to the Emperor, and the <HI>Spani&s;h Netherlands</HI> to the Elector of <HI>Bavaria:</HI> The Trade was to be regulated, as it was before the War; &s;ome Places in <HI>Canada</HI> were to be re&s;tored to <HI>England,</HI> with the freedom of Fi&s;hery in <HI>Newfoundland;</HI> but <HI>Placentia</HI> was to remain with the <HI>French: Dunkirk</HI> was o&s;&s;ered to be demoli&s;hed; but <HI>Li&s;le</HI> and <HI>Tournay</HI> were to be given for it: The <HI>States</HI> were to have their Demands for the Barrier; and the Frontier between <HI>France,</HI> the Empire, and <HI>Italy,</HI> was to be the &s;ame, that it was before the War; by which <HI>Landau, Fene&s;irella,</HI> and <HI>Exiles,</HI> were to be re&s;tored to <HI>France.</HI> The&s;e Demands were as extravagant, as any that <HI>France</HI> could have made, in the mo&s;t pro&s;perous State of their Affairs: This &s;illed the Allies with In|dignation, and heightned the Jealou&s;y they had of a &s;ecret Under|&s;tanding, between the Courts of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="600" REF="628">
But a great Change happened in the Affairs of <HI>France,</HI> at this very time, that their Plenipotentiaries were making the&s;e Demands at <HI>Utrecht:</HI> The <HI>Dauphine&s;s</HI> was taken &s;uddenly ill of a Surfeit, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Death of the two <HI>Dauphins.</HI></NOTE> as it was given out, and died in three days; and within three or four days after that, the <HI>Dauphin</HI> him&s;elf died; and in a few days after him, his elde&s;t Son, about five or &s;ix Years old, died like|wi&s;e; and his &s;econd Son, then about three Years old, was thought to be in a dying condition: The&s;e Deaths coming &s;o quick one after another, &s;truck that Court: The King him&s;elf was for &s;ome days ill, but he &s;oon recovered. Such repeated Strokes were look'd on with amazement: Poi&s;on was &s;u&s;pected, as is u&s;ual upon all &s;uch occa&s;ions; and the Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI> was generally charged with it: He was believed to have dealt much in Chymi&s;try, and was an ambitious Prince. While he was in <HI>Spain,</HI> at the head of King <HI>Philip</HI>'s Army, he formed a Project to &s;et him a&s;ide, and to make him&s;elf King of <HI>Spain;</HI> in which, as the Lord <HI>Town&s;hend</HI> told me, he went &s;o far, that he try'd to engage Mr. <HI>Stanhope,</HI> to pre&s;s the Queen and the <HI>States</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, promi&s;ing to break with <HI>France,</HI> and to marry King <HI>Charles</HI>'s Dowager. This came to be di&s;covered: He was upon that called out of <HI>Spain;</HI> and it was thought, that the only thing that &s;aved him, was the King's kindne&s;s to his Natural Daughter, whom he had married. The King not only pa&s;t it over; but &s;oon after, he obliged the Duke of <HI>Berry</HI> to marry his Daughter: &s;uch care had that old King taken, to corrupt the Blood of <HI>France,</HI> with the mixture of his &s;purious I&s;&s;ue. King <HI>Philip</HI> was not at all plea&s;ed with the Alliance; but wrote to his elder Brother, ex|po&s;tulating for his not oppo&s;ing the Marriage more vigorou&s;ly; with which he pro&s;e&s;t him&s;elf &s;o di&s;plea&s;ed, that he could not be brought to congratulate upon it. This Letter was &s;ent from <HI>Ma|drid</HI> to <HI>Paris;</HI> but was intercepted, and &s;ent to <HI>Barcelona,</HI> and from thence to the <HI>Hague;</HI> Dr. <HI>Hare</HI> told me, he read the original Letter.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> when he became <HI>Dauphin,</HI> upon his Father's death, had been let into the under&s;tanding the Secrets of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cha|racter of the <HI>Dauphin</HI></NOTE> Government; and, as was given out, he had on many occa&s;ions expre&s;&s;ed a deep Sen&s;e of the Mi&s;eries of the People, with great Sentiments of Ju&s;tice: He had likewi&s;e, in &s;ome Di&s;putes that Cardinal <HI>de Noailles</HI> had with the Je&s;uits, e&s;pou&s;ed his Intere&s;ts, and protected him. It was al&s;o believed, that he retained a great Affection to the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Cambray,</HI> who&s;e Fable of <HI>Tele|machus</HI> carried in it the noble&s;t Maxims po&s;&s;ible, for the Conduct of a wi&s;e and good Prince, and &s;et forth that Station in &s;hining Characters, but which were the Rever&s;e of <HI>Lewis</HI> the XIVth's whole Li&s;e and Reign.

Sen&s;e of the Lo&s;s they had in his Death; and the Apprehen&s;ions of a Minority, after &s;uch a Reign, &s;truck them with a great Con|&s;ternation.

The Propo&s;itions made by the <HI>French</HI> were treated here with the greate&s;t Scorn; nor did the Mini&s;ters pretend to &s;ay any thing in excu&s;e for them: And an Addre&s;s was made to the Queen, expre&s;&s;ing a ju&s;t Indignation at &s;uch a Pro|ceeding, promi&s;ing her all A&s;&s;i&s;tance in carrying on the War, 'till &s;he &s;hould arrive at a ju&s;t and honourable Peace.</P>
<P>The Allies did offer their Demands next, which ran as high <NOTE PLACE="marg">The De|mands of the Allies.</NOTE> another way: The Emperor asked the whole <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy; <HI>England</HI> asked the re&s;toring <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> and the demoli&s;hing of <HI>Dunkirk;</HI> the <HI>States</HI> asked their whole <HI>Barrier;</HI> and every Allie asked Satisfaction to all the other Allies, as well as to him|&s;elf: <HI>England</HI> and the <HI>States</HI> declared, that they demanded <HI>Spain</HI> and the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> for the Emperor; &s;o the high Pattern &s;et by the <HI>French,</HI> in their Demands, was to the full imitated by the Allies. The <HI>French</HI> &s;et a Day, for offering their An&s;wer; but when the Day came, in&s;tead of offering an An&s;wer in Writing, they propo&s;ed to enter into verbal Conferences, upon the Demands made on both &s;ides: This had indeed been practi&s;ed in Treaties, where Mediators interpo&s;ed; but that was not done, 'till the main Points were &s;ecretly agreed to. The Allies rejected this Propo&s;i|tion, and demanded &s;pecifick An&s;wers in Writing; &s;o, till the be|ginning of <HI>May,</HI> the Treaty went on in a very languid manner, in many fruitle&s;s Meetings, the <HI>French</HI> always &s;aying, they had yet received no other Orders: &s;o that the Negotiation there was at a full &s;tand.</P>

<P>There was a Doubt &s;ugge&s;ted, whether the Queen's Licence <NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceedings in Con$o|cation.</NOTE> did &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t, after a Prorogation by a Royal Writ: The Attor|ney General gave his Opinion, that it was &s;till in force; upon which, the Bi&s;hops went on with the Re&s;olution, in which the former Se&s;&s;ion had ended, and &s;ent back to the Lower Hou&s;e a Paper, which had been &s;ent to them from that Hou&s;e in the for|mer Se&s;&s;ion, with &s;uch Amendments, as they thought proper: But then <HI>Atterbury</HI> &s;tarted a new Notion, That as, in a Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, a Prorogation put an end to all Matters not fini&s;hed, &s;o that they were to begin all a-new; the &s;ame Rule was to be ap|plied to Convocations, in pur&s;uance of his favourite Notion, that the Proceedings in Parliament were likewi&s;e to be ob&s;erved among&s;t them. The Bi&s;hops did not agree to this; for, upon &s;earching their Books, they found a Cour&s;e of Precedents to the contrary: And the Schedule, by which the Archbi&s;hop prorogued them, when the Royal Writ was &s;ent him, did in expre&s;s Words conti|nue all things, in the State in which they were then, to their next Meeting. Yet this did not &s;atisfy <HI>Atterbury</HI> and his Party; &s;o the Lower Hou&s;e ordered him to lay the Matter before the At|torney-General for his Opinion; he did that very partially, for he did not &s;hew him the Paper &s;ent down by the Bi&s;hops; he only gave him a very defective Ab&s;tract of it: whereupon the Attorney-General gave him &s;uch an An&s;wer as he de&s;ired, by which it was very plain, that he was not rightly informed about it. The Bi&s;hops
<PB N="603" REF="631">
re&s;olved to adhere to the method of former Convocations, and not to begin Matters afre&s;h, that had been formerly near fini&s;hed. By this means they were at a full &s;top, &s;o that they could not deter|mine tho&s;e Points, which had been recommended to them by the Queen: But they entered upon new ones; there was then a Bill, in the Hou&s;e of Parliament, for building fifty new Churches, in and about <HI>London</HI> and <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter;</HI> &s;o an Office, for con&s;ecrating Churches and Church-yards, was prepared: and probably this will be all the Fruit, that the Church will reap from this Convo|cation.</P>
<P>The Cen&s;ure that was pa&s;s'd on <HI>Whi&s;ton</HI>'s Book, in the former <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cen&s;ure on <HI>Whi&s;ton</HI>'s Book not confirmed by the Queen.</NOTE> Se&s;&s;ion, had been laid before the Queen in due form for her Ap|probation: But at the opening of this Se&s;&s;ion in <HI>December,</HI> the Bi&s;hops finding that no Return was come from the Throne in that Matter, &s;ent two of their number, to receive her Maje&s;ty's Plea&s;ure in it; the Archbi&s;hop being &s;o ill of the Gout, that he came not among us all that Winter. The Queen had put the Cen&s;ure, that we had &s;ent her, into the hands of &s;ome of her Mini&s;ters, but could not remember to whom &s;he gave it; &s;o a new Extract of it was &s;ent to her; and &s;he &s;aid, &s;he would &s;end her Plea&s;ure upon it very &s;peedily: but none came during the Se&s;&s;ion, &s;o all further Proceed|ings again&s;t him were &s;topped, &s;ince the Queen did not confirm the &s;tep, that we had made. This was not unacceptable to &s;ome of us, and to my&s;elf in particular; I was gone into my Dioce&s;s, when that Cen&s;ure was pa&s;&s;ed; and I have ever thought, that the true Intere&s;t of the Chri&s;tian Religion was be&s;t con&s;ulted, when nice di&s;puting about My&s;teries was laid a&s;ide and forgotten.</P>
<P>There appeared at this time an Inclination, in many of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Inclina|tion in &s;ome of the Cler|gy towards Popery.</NOTE> Clergy, to a nearer Approach towards the Church of <HI>Rome; Hicks,</HI> an ill-tempered Man, who was now at the Head of the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Party, had in &s;everal Books promoted a Notion, that there was a proper Sacrifice made in the <HI>Euchari&s;t,</HI> and had on many occa|&s;ions &s;tudied to le&s;&s;en our Aver&s;ion to Popery: The Supremacy of the Crown in Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Matters, and the Method in which the Reformation was carried, was openly condemned; one <HI>Brett</HI> had preached a Sermon, in &s;everal of the Pulpits of <HI>London,</HI> which he afterwards printed; in which he pre&s;&s;ed the nece&s;&s;ity of Prie&s;tly Ab&s;olution, in a &s;train beyond what was pretended to even in the Church of <HI>Rome:</HI> He &s;aid no Repentance could &s;erve without it, and affirmed, that the Prie&s;t was ve&s;ted, with the &s;ame power of Pardoning, that our Saviour him&s;elf had. A Motion was made in the Lower Hou&s;e of Convocation, to cen&s;ure this; but it was &s;o ill &s;upported, that it was let fall. Another Conceit was taken up, of the Invalidity of Lay-Bapti&s;m, on which &s;everal Books have been
<PB N="604" REF="632">
writ; nor was the Di&s;pute a trifling one, &s;ince by this Notion, the Teachers among the Di&s;&s;enters pa&s;&s;ing for Lay-Men, this went to the re-baptizing them and their Congregations.</P>
<P><HI>Dodwell</HI> gave the Ri&s;e to this Conceit; he was a very learned <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dodwell</HI>'s Notions.</NOTE> Man, and led a &s;trict Life; he &s;eemed to hunt after Paradoxes in all his Writings, and broached not a few; he thought none could be &s;aved, but tho&s;e who, by the Sacraments, had a federal Right to it; and that the&s;e were the Seals of the Covenant: So that he left all, who died without the Sacraments, to the uncovenanted Mercies of God; and to this he added, that none had a Right to give the Sacraments, but tho&s;e who were commi&s;&s;ioned to it; and the&s;e were the Apo&s;tles, and after them Bi&s;hops and Prie&s;ts or|dained by them: It followed upon this, that Sacraments ad|mini&s;tred by others were of no Value. He pur&s;ued the&s;e No|tions &s;o far, that he a&s;&s;erted that the Souls of Men were na|turally mortal, but that the immortalizing Virtue was conveyed by Bapti&s;m, given by Per&s;ons Epi&s;copally ordained. And yet, after all this, which carried the Epi&s;copal Function &s;o high, he did not lay the Original of that Government, on any In&s;truction or War|rant in the Scripture: But thought it was &s;et up, in the beginning of the &s;econd Century, after the Apo&s;tles were all dead. He wrote very doubtfully of the Time, in which the Canon of the New Te&s;tament was &s;ettled; he thought it was not before the &s;econd Century, and that an extraordinary In&s;piration was continued in the Churches to that very Time, to which he a&s;cribed the Origi|nal of Epi&s;copacy. This &s;trange and precarious Sy&s;tem was in great credit among us; and the Nece&s;&s;ity of the Sacrament, and the Invalidity of eccle&s;ia&s;tical Functions, when performed by Per|&s;ons, who were not Epi&s;copally ordained, were entertained by many with great Applau&s;e: This made the Di&s;&s;enters pa&s;s for no Chri&s;tians, and put all Thoughts of reconciling them to us far out of view: And &s;everal little Books were &s;pread about the Nation, to prove the nece&s;&s;ity of re-baptizing them, and that they were in a State of Damnation 'till that was done; but few were, by the&s;e Arguments, prevailed upon to be re-baptized: This &s;truck even at the Bapti&s;m by Midwives in the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> which was practi&s;ed and connived at here in <HI>England,</HI> 'till it was objected in the Conference, held at <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> &s;oon after King <HI>James</HI> the Fir&s;t's Acce&s;&s;ion to the Crown, and Bapti&s;m was not 'till then limited to Per&s;ons in Orders: Nothing of this kind was &s;o much as mentioned in the Year 1660, when a great part of the Nation had been baptized by Di&s;&s;enters; but it was now promoted with much heat.</P>
<P><PB N="605" REF="633">
The Bi&s;hops thought it nece&s;&s;ary to put a &s;top to this new and extravagant Doctrine; &s;o a Declaration was agreed to, fir&s;t again&s;t the Irregularity of all Bapti&s;m by Per&s;ons, who were not <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bi&s;hops de&s;igned to condemn the re|baptizing Di&s;&s;enters.</NOTE> in Holy Orders; but that yet, according to the Practice of the Primitive Church, and the con&s;tant U&s;age of the Church of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> no Bapti&s;m (in or with Water, in the Name of the Father, Son and Holy Gho&s;t) ought to be reiterated. The Archbi&s;hop of <HI>York</HI> at fir&s;t agreed to this; &s;o it was re&s;olved to publi&s;h it, in the Name of all the Bi&s;hops of <HI>England;</HI> but he was prevailed on to change his Mind; and refu&s;ed to &s;ign it, pretending that this would encourage irregular Bapti&s;m: So the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> with mo&s;t of the Bi&s;hops of his Province, re&s;olved to <NOTE PLACE="marg">But the Clergy did not agree to it.</NOTE> offer it to the Convocation. It was agreed to in the Upper Hou&s;e, the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> only di&s;&s;enting: But when it was &s;ent to the Lower Hou&s;e, they would not &s;o much as take it into con&s;ide|ration, but laid it a&s;ide; thinking that it would encourage tho&s;e, who &s;truck at the Dignity of the Prie&s;thood. This was all that pa&s;s'd in Convocation.</P>
<P>The Supplies demanded were given, in all about &s;ix Millions; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Sup|plies given.</NOTE> there were two Lotteries of 1,800,000 <HI>l.</HI> a-piece, be&s;ides the Four Shillings in the Pound, and the Malt Bill. A Motion was made for a Clau&s;e, to be put in one of the Lottery Bills, for a Commi&s;|&s;ion to enquire into the Value and Con&s;ideration of all the Grants, made by King <HI>William.</HI> The Mini&s;ters apprehended the diffi|culty of carrying a Money-Bill, with a Tack to it, thro' the Hou&s;e of Lords; &s;o they prevailed to get it &s;eparated from the Money-Bill, and &s;ent up in a particular one; and undertook to carry it. When it came up to the Hou&s;e of Lords, a great Party was made again&s;t it; tho&s;e who continued to pay a Re&s;pect to the Memory of King <HI>William,</HI> thought it was a very unbecoming Return to him, who had delivered the Nation from Slavery and Popery, to ca&s;t &s;o particular an Indignity on his Grants: The Bill made all its Steps thro' the Hou&s;e of Lords to the la&s;t, with a &s;mall Majority of one or two. The Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI> was ab|&s;ent the fir&s;t two Days, but came to the Hou&s;e on the la&s;t; he &s;aid, he always thought tho&s;e Grants were too large, and very un&s;ea&s;onably made, but he thought there ought to be an equal way of proceeding in that Matter; they ought either to re&s;ume them all, or to bring all concerned in them, to an equal Compo|&s;ition: He therefore could not approve of this Bill, which by a very clear Con&s;equence would put it in the power of a Fellow-Subject, to re&s;ume or to cover Grants, at his plea&s;ure; and &s;o it would put the Per&s;ons, concerned in the Grants, into too great
<PB N="606" REF="634">
a Dependance on him. At the la&s;t reading of the Bill &s;eventy|eight, in Per&s;on or by Proxy, were for the Bill; and as many were again&s;t it: The Votes being equal, by the Rule of the Hou&s;e, the Negative carried it: So, for that time, the Bill was lo&s;t.</P>
<P>During the Se&s;&s;ion, Reports were often given out, that all things were agreed, and that the Treaty was as good as fini&s;hed: But new Stories were &s;et on foot, and pretended Delays, to put off the Expectation of Peace; however, in the end of <HI>May,</HI> we were &s;urprized with Letters from the Camp, which told us, that the Army of the Allies being joined, was 25000 Men &s;tronger than the <HI>French;</HI> an Advantage that they never had before, during the whole cour&s;e of the War. That Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> there|fore <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> ordered not to act of|fen&s;ively.</NOTE> propo&s;ed, that they &s;hould march towards the Head of the <HI>Scheld,</HI> where the <HI>French</HI> Army lay, and upon their advancing the <HI>French</HI> would be obliged, either to venture on Action, or to retire; and in that ca&s;e <HI>Cambray</HI> would be left open to the Al|lies, to &s;it down before it. The Council of War agreed to this, but to their great &s;urprize, the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> &s;hewed Orders, not to act offen&s;ively again&s;t the <HI>French;</HI> he &s;eemed to be very un|ea&s;y with the&s;e Orders, but &s;aid he mu&s;t obey them. This was much re&s;ented by the whole Army, and by the Mini&s;ters of the Allies at the <HI>Hague</HI> and at <HI>Utrecht:</HI> And it &s;truck us here in <HI>England</HI> with Amazement.</P>
<P>Motions were made upon it, in both Hou&s;es of Parliament; for it &s;eemed, we were neither to have Peace nor War: So it was pro|po&s;ed, that an Addre&s;s &s;hould be made to the Queen, that &s;he would &s;et the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> at liberty, to act in concurrence with the other Generals, and carry on the War, &s;o as to obtain a good Peace. Tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed this, asked, what Proofs they had, of what was &s;aid, concerning the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI>'s Orders; they had only private Letters, which were not produced: So, it was &s;aid, there was not ground enough to found an Addre&s;s upon; which ought not to be made, on bare Reports. The Mini&s;ters would neither confe&s;s, nor deny the Matter, pretending the Oath of Secrecy; yet they affirmed the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> was at liberty to cover a Siege.</P>
<P>That which prevailed in both Hou&s;es, to hinder the Addre&s;s, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A &s;eparate Peace di&s;|owned by the Lord Trea&s;urer.</NOTE> was, that the Mini&s;ters in both did affirm, that the Peace was agreed on, and would be laid before them in three or four Days: It was upon that &s;ugge&s;ted, that this mu&s;t be a &s;eparate Peace, &s;ince the Allies knew nothing of it. The Lord Trea&s;urer &s;aid, a &s;eparate Peace was &s;o ba&s;e, &s;o knavi&s;h, and &s;o villainous a thing, that every one who &s;erved the Queen knew, they mu&s;t an&s;wer it with their Heads to the Nation; but it would appear to be a &s;afe
<PB N="607" REF="635">
and a glorious Peace, much more to the Honour and Intere&s;t of the Nation, than the Preliminaries that were agreed to, three Years before: He al&s;o affirmed, that the Allies knew of it, and were &s;atisfied with it; &s;o the Motion fell: And all were in great expectation, to &s;ee what a few Days would produce. In order to this, it was propo&s;ed to examine into all the Proceedings at the <HI>Hague,</HI> and at <HI>Gertruydenberg,</HI> in the Years 1709 and 1710; this was &s;et on by a Repre&s;entation made by the Earl of <HI>Strafford;</HI> for he affirmed in the Hou&s;e of Lords, that tho&s;e Matters had not been fairly repre&s;ented; he &s;aid, he had his Information from one of the two, who had been imployed in tho&s;e Conferences: By this, it was plain he meant <HI>Buys.</HI> Lord <HI>Town&s;hend</HI> had in|formed the Hou&s;e, that tho&s;e who treated with the <HI>French</HI> at <HI>Gertruydenberg</HI> did, at their return, give an Account of their Negotiation to the Mini&s;ters of the Allies, in the Pen&s;ioner's pre|&s;ence, before they reported it to the <HI>States</HI> them&s;elves: But upon this, the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> &s;aid, they had been fir&s;t &s;ecretly with the Pen&s;ioner, who directed them both what to &s;ay, and what to &s;uppre&s;s. Upon this, the Hou&s;e made an Addre&s;s to the Queen, de&s;iring her to lay before them all that pa&s;&s;ed at that Time, and in that Negotiation: But nothing followed upon this; for it was &s;aid to be de&s;igned only to amu&s;e the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Surprizes came at this time quick one after another: At <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen, by the Bi|&s;hop of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> &s;aid &s;he was free from all her Treaties with the <HI>States.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Utrecht,</HI> on the &s;econd of <HI>June</HI> N. S. the Plenipotentiaries of the <HI>States</HI> expo&s;tulated with the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> upon the Orders &s;ent to the Duke of <HI>Ormond:</HI> He an&s;wered, he knew nothing of them; but &s;aid, he had received a Letter, two Days before, from the Queen, in which &s;he complained that, notwith&s;tanding all the Advances &s;he had made, to engage the <HI>States</HI> to enter with her upon a Plan of Peace, they had not an&s;wered her as they ought, and as &s;he hoped they would have done: therefore &s;he did now think her&s;elf at liberty, to enter into &s;eparate Mea&s;ures, to obtain a Peace for her own Convenience. The Plenipoten|tiaries &s;aid, this was contrary to all their Alliances and Treaties; they thought that, by the Deference they had &s;hewed Her, on all occa&s;ions, they had merited much better U&s;age from Her: They knew nothing of any Advances made to them, on a Plan of Peace. The Bi&s;hop replied, that con&s;idering the Conduct of the <HI>States,</HI> the Queen thought her&s;elf di&s;engaged from all Al|liances and Engagements with them: The Bi&s;hop did not in ex|pre&s;s Words name the <HI>Barrier Treaty;</HI> but he did not except it: So they reckoned it was included, in the general Words he had u&s;ed. This did not agree, with what the Lord Trea&s;urer had &s;aid in the Hou&s;e of Lords: And when the <HI>States</HI> Envoy
<PB N="608" REF="636">
complained to him, of the&s;e Declarations made them by the Bi|&s;hop, all the An&s;wer he made was, <HI>that he was certainly in a very had humour, when he talked at that rate.</HI></P>
<P>On the fifth of <HI>June,</HI> the Queen came to the Parliament, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen laid before the Parlia|ment the Plan of the Peace.</NOTE> told them on what Terms a Peace might be had: King <HI>Philip</HI> was to renounce the Succe&s;&s;ion to the Crown of <HI>France,</HI> if it &s;hould devolve on him; and this was to execute it&s;elf, by putting the next to him into the Succe&s;&s;ion: <HI>Sicily</HI> was to be &s;eparated from <HI>Spain,</HI> tho' it was not yet &s;ettled, who &s;hould have it. The Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion was to be &s;ecured; and he, who had pre|tended to the Crown, was no more to be &s;upported. <HI>Dunkirk</HI> was to be demoli&s;hed, and <HI>Newfoundland</HI> to be delivered to <HI>Eng|land. Gibraltar</HI> and <HI>Port-Mahon</HI> were to remain in our hands: We were al&s;o to have the <HI>A&s;&s;iento,</HI> a Word importing, the fur|ni&s;hing the <HI>Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indies</HI> with Slaves from <HI>Africa.</HI> The <HI>Dutch</HI> were to have their <HI>Barrier,</HI> except two or three Places: And due regard would be had to all our Allies.</P>
<P>Both Hou&s;es agreed to make Addre&s;&s;es of Thanks to the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Addre&s;&s;es of both Hou&s;es upon it.</NOTE> Queen, for communicating this Plan to them, de&s;iring her to <HI>fini&s;h it:</HI> An Addition to the&s;e la&s;t Words, <HI>in conjunction with her Allies,</HI> was moved in both Hou&s;es; that &s;o there might be a Gua|ranty &s;ettled for the maintaining the Terms of the Treaty: But it was rejected, by a great Majority in both Hou&s;es. It was &s;aid, in oppo&s;ition to it, that it would &s;ubject the Queen and the whole Treaty, to the Plea&s;ure of the Allies, who might prove backward and intractable: And &s;ince <HI>England</HI> had born the greate&s;t &s;hare of the Burthen of the War, it was rea&s;onable that the Queen &s;hould be the Arbiter of the Peace. On the other hand it was &s;aid, that if the Allies did not enter into a Guaranty, we mu&s;t depend on the Faith of the <HI>French,</HI> and be at their mercy; and &s;o have nothing to tru&s;t to, but the Promi&s;es of a Court noted, in a cour&s;e of many Years, for a Train of Perfidy: But many had formed an ob&s;tinate Re&s;olution to get out of the War on any Terms: So nothing that was offered, that &s;eemed to ob&s;truct the arriving &s;peedily at that end, was heard with patience; and no regard was had to the Faith of Treaties: Yet both Hou&s;es ob&s;erved one Caution, not to expre&s;s their being &s;atisfied with the Plan of the Peace, tho' it was covertly in&s;inuated. Mention was al&s;o made of our Treaties with our Allies, and of the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion: The Lords, who had all along prote&s;ted again&s;t the Steps, that the Court had taken, entred the Rea&s;ons of their prote&s;ting again&s;t the Negative, put on adding the Words, <HI>in conjunction with her Allies,</HI> and on the former Vote, concerning the Orders &s;ent to to the Duke of <HI>Ormond:</HI> The&s;e carried in them &s;uch ju&s;t and

&s;evere Reflections on the Mini&s;try, as running the Nation into an open Breach of all publick Tru&s;t, and putting every thing into the hands of the <HI>French;</HI> that by the Strength of the Majority they were expunged: Yet they were printed, and Copies of them were &s;ent over the Nation; but nothing could break thro' that In&s;en|&s;ibility, which had &s;tupified the People.

<P>About the middle of <HI>June,</HI> the Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament came to <NOTE PLACE="marg">The end of the Se&s;&s;ion of Parlia|ment.</NOTE> an end: The Queen in her Speech &s;aid, &s;he was glad to find they approved of her Scheme of Peace, tho' that was in none of the Ad|dre&s;&s;es; many, who intended to merit by their officious Zeal, had indeed magnified it in both Hou&s;es, but it was not in either of their Addre&s;&s;es.

<P>Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> ordered <HI>Que&s;noy</HI> to be be&s;ieged; and he, in <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> proclaims a Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms, and left Prince <HI>Eugene</HI>'s Army.</NOTE> conjunction with the Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> covered the Siege; but, when the Place was &s;o &s;treightned, that it could not hold out above two or three Days, the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> &s;ent Prince <HI>Eu|gene</HI> word, that he had Orders to proclaim a Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms for two Months.

to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Place. The Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> made a &s;econd Attempt, on the Generals of the <HI>German</HI> Troops, to &s;ee if they would agree to the Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms: But they excu&s;ed them&s;elves, upon the Orders they had received from their Ma&s;ters: So he proclaimed the Ce&s;&s;ation, at the Head of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Troops; upon which, he &s;eparated him&s;elf from Prince <HI>Eugene</HI>'s Army, and retired to <HI>Ghendt</HI> and <HI>Bruges,</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing him&s;elf of them: The fortified Places, near the Frontier, had Orders to let the Officers pa&s;s through, but not to &s;uffer the Troops to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of them. The withdrawing the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Forces in this manner, from the Confederate Army, was cen&s;ured, not only as a manife&s;t Breach of Faith and of Treaties, but as treacherous in the highe&s;t and ba&s;e&s;t degree. The Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> had given the <HI>States</HI> &s;uch A&s;&s;urances, of his going along with them thro' the whole Campaign, that he was let into the Secrets of all their Coun&s;els, which by that Confidence were all known to the <HI>French:</HI> And, if the auxiliary <HI>German</HI> Troops had not been pre|pared to di&s;obey his Orders, it was believed he, in conjunction with the <HI>French</HI> Army, would have forced the <HI>States</HI> to come into the new Mea&s;ures. But that was happily prevented; yet all this Conduct of our General was applauded at home as great, ju&s;t and wi&s;e; and our People were led to think it a kind of Triumph, upon <HI>Dunkirk</HI>'s being put into our hands; not con&s;idering, that we had more truly put our&s;elves into the Hands of the <HI>French,</HI> by this open Breach of Faith; after which, the Con&s;ederates could no longer tru&s;t or depend on us. Nor was this only the Act of the Court and Mini&s;try, but it became the Act of the Nation, which by a general Voice did not only approve of it, but ap|plaud it.</P>
<P>Prince <HI>Eugene</HI>'s next Attempt was upon <HI>Landrecy,</HI> in which <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Landrecy</HI> be&s;ieged.</NOTE> it &s;eemed probable that he would &s;ucceed; but this Pro&s;pect, and indeed the whole Campaign, had a fatal Rever&s;e: There was a Body of 8000 or 10000 Men po&s;ted at <HI>Denain,</HI> on the <HI>Scheld,</HI> commanded by the Earl of <HI>Albemarle,</HI> to &s;ecure the conveying Bread and Ammunition to the Army, and to the Siege. <HI>Villars</HI> made a Motion, as if he de&s;igned to give Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> Battle; but after a Feint that way, he turned quick upon this Body, that lay on both &s;ides of the River, with only one Bridge of Pontoons: The re&s;t had been &s;ent to the Siege of <HI>Landrecy;</HI> and there was not a Supply of more brought. That Bridge, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A grey Lo$span$ $word$ $word$ $word$ $word$ $word$ $word$ $word$ $word$</NOTE> with the Weight that was on it, broke; &s;o the Bodies could not be joined: but Military Men a&s;&s;ured me, that, if it had not been for that Misfortune, <HI>Villar</HI>'s Attempt might have turned fatally on him&s;elf, and to the Ruin of his whole Army. But in conclu|&s;ion,

he gave them a total Defeat, and &s;o made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of tho&s;e Po&s;ts, which they were to defend. This opened a new Scene; it not only forced the rai&s;ing the Siege of <HI>Landrecy,</HI> but gave <HI>Villars</HI> an occa&s;ion to &s;eize on <HI>Marchiennes,</HI> and &s;ome other Places, where he found great Stores of Artillery and Ammuni|tion; and furni&s;hed him likewi&s;e, with an Opportunity of &s;itting down before <HI>Doway.</HI> What Errours were committed, either in the Coun&s;els or Orders, or in the Execution of them, and at who&s;e door the&s;e ought to be laid, is far above my Under&s;tand|ing in Military Matters: But be that as it will, this Misfortune &s;erved not a little to rai&s;e the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI>'s Character, under who&s;e Command no &s;uch thing had ever happened. The Effects of this Di&s;grace were great; <HI>Doway</HI> was taken, after a long and brave Defence; Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> tried to rai&s;e the Siege, but did not &s;ucceed in it: indeed the <HI>States</HI> would not put things to &s;o great a venture, after &s;uch a Lo&s;s; the Garri&s;on were made Pri&s;oners of War. <HI>Que&s;noy</HI> was next be&s;ieged; the great Artil|lery, that had been employed in the Siege, were left in the place: The Garri&s;on improved that Advantage; &s;o that the taking it co&s;t the Enemy very dear.</P>
<P>The&s;e Lo&s;&s;es created a great Di&s;traction in the Coun&s;els at the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;tractions at the <HI>Hague.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Hague;</HI> many were inclined to accept of a Ce&s;&s;ation; the Em|peror and the Princes of the Empire made great Offers to the <HI>States,</HI> to per&s;uade them to continue the War; at the &s;ame time, the <HI>French</HI> grew very in&s;olent upon their Succe&s;&s;es, and took oc|ca&s;ion, from a Quarrel between the Footmen of one of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Plenipotentiaries, and one of theirs, to demand an extravagant Reparation; which the <HI>Dutch</HI> not complying with, a full &s;top was put to all Proceedings at <HI>Utrecht,</HI> for &s;ome Months. Our Court took &s;ome pains to remove that Ob&s;truction; but the <HI>French</HI> King's Pride being now again in exaltation, he was in|tractable: <HI>St. John,</HI> being made Vi&s;count <HI>Bolingbroke,</HI> was &s;ent over with &s;ecret In&s;tructions, to the Court of <HI>France;</HI> where, as it was believed, the Peace was fully concluded: But all, that was publi&s;hed upon his Return, was a new Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms, both by Sea and Land, for four Months longer. Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> was named to go Amba&s;&s;ador to <HI>France,</HI> and Lord <HI>Lexington</HI> to <HI>Spain.</HI> The Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> continued to pre&s;s the <HI>States,</HI> to come into the Queen's Mea&s;ures, which 'twas &s;aid he managed with great Imperiou&s;ne&s;s: The <HI>States</HI> re&s;olved to offer their Plan to the Queen, in which they pre&s;&s;ed the re&s;toring <HI>Strazbourg</HI> to the Empire, to have <HI>Valenciennes</HI> demoli&s;hed, and <HI>Cond&eacute;</HI> added to their Barrier, and that the old <HI>Tariff</HI> for Trade &s;hould be again re&s;tored.</P>

The Lord <HI>Lexington</HI> went fir&s;t to <HI>Spain,</HI> where the <HI>Cortes</HI> were &s;ummoned, in which that King did &s;olemnly renounce, for him&s;elf and his Heirs, the Right of Succe&s;&s;ion to the Crown of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Re|nunciation of the Suc|ce&s;&s;ions in <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>France.</HI></NOTE> <HI>France;</HI> and limited the Succe&s;&s;ion to the Crown of <HI>Spain,</HI> after his own Po&s;terity, to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Savoy.</HI> The like Renunciation was made &s;ome Months after that, by the Princes of <HI>France</HI> to the Crown of <HI>Spain:</HI> And <HI>Philip</HI> was declared incapable of &s;ucceed|ing to the Crown of <HI>France.</HI> It was &s;omething &s;trange, to &s;ee &s;o much Weight laid on the&s;e Renunciations, &s;ince the King of <HI>France</HI> had &s;o often, and &s;o &s;olemnly declared (upon his claiming, in the right of his Queen, the <HI>Spani&s;h Netherlands;</HI> when the Renunciation made by his Queen before the Marriage, pur&s;uant to the Treaty of the <HI>Pyrenees,</HI> of all Rights of Succe&s;&s;ion to her Father's Dominions, was objected to him) that no Renunciation, which was but a civil Act, could de&s;troy the Rights of Blood, founded on the Laws of Nature: But this was now forgot, or very little con&s;idered.

<P>The War in <HI>Pomerania</HI> went on but &s;lowly, tho' the <HI>Czar</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Affairs in the <HI>North.</HI></NOTE> and the Kings of <HI>Denmark</HI> and <HI>Poland</HI> joined their Forces; upon which it was thought, the Intere&s;t of <HI>Sweden</HI> mu&s;t have &s;unk in tho&s;e Parts: But the Feeblene&s;s of one or other of tho&s;e Princes lo&s;t them great Advantages. <HI>Steinbock,</HI> the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> General, &s;eeing the <HI>Danes</HI> were &s;eparated from their Allies, made a quick March toward them; and, tho' the <HI>Saxons</HI> had joined them, be|fore he came up, yet he attacked them.

At the &s;ame time the <HI>Swedes</HI> were animated, by Reports from <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> which gave them Hopes of the War, between the <HI>Turks</HI> and the <HI>Czar,</HI> being like to break out again, which the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> continued to &s;ollicit, and in which he had all the A&s;&s;i&s;tance, that the <HI>French</HI> could give him.</P>
<P>This gave the Emperor great Apprehen&s;ions, that Di&s;orders in <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Empe|ror prepares for the War with <HI>France.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Hungary</HI> might follow upon it, which would defeat the Mea&s;ures he had taken to &s;ettle Matters in that Kingdom, &s;o that being &s;afe on that &s;ide, he might turn his whole Force again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> and by that means, encourage the <HI>States</HI> to continue the War.

A Force much &s;uperiour to his, was brought again&s;t him; but he maintained him&s;elf &s;o re&s;olutely in his Hou&s;e, that &s;ome Hundreds of tho&s;e who attacked him were killed: The <HI>Turks</HI> upon that &s;et &s;ire to the Hou&s;e, whereupon he was forced to &s;urrender, and was put under a Guard; and mo&s;t of his <HI>Swedes</HI> were &s;old for Slaves; he was carried to a Hou&s;e near <HI>Adrianople,</HI> but not &s;uffered to come to Court; only the <HI>Sultan</HI> di&s;owned the Violence u&s;ed to his Per&s;on. In the mean while, the <HI>Czar</HI> &s;hipped an Army from <HI>Petersburgh,</HI> that landed in <HI>Finland:</HI> The <HI>Swedes</HI> were not able to &s;tand before him; every Place, as he advanced, &s;ub|mitted to him; and he was now Ma&s;ter of <HI>Abo,</HI> the Capital of <HI>Finland,</HI> and of that whole Province. <HI>Stcinbock,</HI> with his Army, maintained him&s;elf in <HI>Tonningen,</HI> as long as their Provi&s;ion la&s;ted: But, all Supplies being carefully &s;topp'd, he was forced at la&s;t to deliver up him&s;elf and his Army Pri&s;oners of War; and the&s;e were the be&s;t Troops the <HI>Swedes</HI> had, &s;o that <HI>Sweden</HI> was &s;truck with a general Con&s;ternation: In this di&s;tracted State has that fu|rious Prince abandoned his own Kingdom. And there I mu&s;t leave it, to return to our own Affairs.</P>
<P>After a long Expectation we at la&s;t knew, that on the thir|teenth <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Trea|ties $word$ and $word$ $word$ Par+liament opened</NOTE> of <HI>March</HI> the Treaty of Peace between <HI>England, France,</HI> and the <HI>States</HI> was &s;igned: Upon this, the Parliament was opened on the ninth of <HI>April.</HI> The Queen in her Speech told the two Hou&s;es, that &s;he had now concluded a Peace, and had obtained a further Security for the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, and that &s;he was in an intire Union with the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover;</HI> &s;he asked of the
<PB N="618" REF="646">
Commons, the nece&s;&s;ary Supplies, and recommended to both Hou&s;es, the cultivating the Arts of Peace, with a Reflection upon Faction. Upon this Speech, a Debate aro&s;e in the Hou&s;e of Lords, concerning &s;ome Words, that were moved to be put in the Ad|dre&s;s, (which of cour&s;e was to be made to the Queen) applauding the Conditions of the Peace, and the Security for the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion: This was oppo&s;ed, &s;ince we did not yet know what the Conditions of the Peace were, nor what that Security was; all that appeared was, that the <HI>Pretender</HI> was gone out of <HI>France</HI> into the <HI>Barrois,</HI> a Part of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> for which that Duke did Homage to the Crown of <HI>France.</HI> An Addre&s;s of Congratulation was agreed to, but without any Approbation of the Peace. The Hou&s;e of Commons ob&s;erved the &s;ame Caution in their Addre&s;s. But upon this, a new Set of Addre&s;&s;es ran thro' the Nation, in the u&s;ual Strains of Flattery and fal&s;e Eloquence. The Parliament &s;ate above a Month, before the Articles of Peace (and of a Treaty of Commerce, made at that &s;ame time) were laid before them. It was given out, that, 'till the Ratifications were exchanged, it was not proper to publi&s;h them; but when that was done, they were communicated to both Hou&s;es, and printed.</P>
<P>By the Treaty of Peace, the <HI>French</HI> King was bound to give <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sub|&s;tance of the Treaties of Peace and Commerce</NOTE> neither Harbour nor A&s;&s;i&s;tance to the <HI>Pretender,</HI> but acknow|ledged the Queen's Title and the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, as it was &s;ettled by &s;everal Acts of Parliament: <HI>Dunkirk</HI> was to be razed in a Time limited, within five Months, after the Ratifications; but that was not to be begun, 'till an Equivalent for it was put in the hands of <HI>France. Newfoundland, Hud&s;on's Bay,</HI> and <HI>St. Chri&s;topher's</HI> were to be given to <HI>England;</HI> but <HI>Cape Breton</HI> was left to the <HI>French,</HI> with a Liberty to dry their Fi&s;h on <HI>Newfoundland:</HI> This was the main Sub&s;tance of the Articles of Peace. The Treaty of Commerce &s;ettled a free Trade, according to the <HI>Tariff</HI> in the Year 1664, excepting &s;ome Commodities, that were &s;ubjected to a new <HI>Tariff</HI> in the Year 1699, which was &s;o high, that it amounted to a Prohibition: All the Productions of <HI>France</HI> were to come into <HI>England</HI> under no other Duties, but tho&s;e that were laid on the &s;ame Productions from other Countries; and when this was &s;ettled, then Commi&s;|&s;aries were to be &s;ent to <HI>London,</HI> to agree and adju&s;t all Matters relating to Trade: The Treaty of Commerce with <HI>Spain</HI> was not yet fini&s;hed. As for the Allies, <HI>Portugal</HI> and <HI>Savoy</HI> were &s;atisfied; the Emperor was to have the Dutchy of <HI>Milan,</HI> the Kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> and the <HI>Spani&s;h Netherlands: Sicily</HI> was to be given to the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> with the Title of King: And <HI>Sardinia,</HI> with the &s;ame Title, was to be given to the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> in lieu of his Lo&s;&s;es: The <HI>States</HI> were to deliver up <HI>Li&s;le,</HI> and the little
<PB N="619" REF="647">
Places about it: And, be&s;ides the Places of which they were al|ready po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, they were to have <HI>Namur, Charleroy, Luxem|bourg, Ypres,</HI> and <HI>Newport:</HI> The King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ta</HI> was to have the <HI>Upper Guelder,</HI> in lieu of <HI>Orange,</HI> and the other E&s;tates, which the Family had in <HI>Franche Comt&eacute;:</HI> This was all that I think nece&s;&s;ary to in&s;ert here, with relation to our Treaty: The Em|peror was to have time to the fir&s;t of <HI>June,</HI> to declare his accepting of it. It did not appear what Equivalent the King of <HI>France</HI> was to have for <HI>Dunkirk:</HI> No mention was made of it in the Treaty; &s;o the Hou&s;e of Commons made an Addre&s;s to the Queen, de|&s;iring to know what that Equivalent was. Some Weeks pa&s;&s;ed before they had an An&s;wer; at la&s;t the Queen by a Me&s;&s;age &s;aid, the <HI>French</HI> King had that Equivalent already in his own hands; but we were &s;till in the dark as to that, no further Explanation being made of it. As to <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> it was thought that the <HI>French</HI> &s;ettling at <HI>Cape Breton,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>Placentia,</HI> would be of great advantage to them with relation to the Fi&s;hery, which is the only thing, that makes Settlements in tho&s;e Parts of any Value. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have always pretended that, the fir&s;t Di&s;co|very of <HI>Newfoundland</HI> being made in <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh's Time, the Right to it was in the Crown of <HI>England.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> had leave given them in King <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t's Time to fi&s;h there, paying Tribute, as an Acknowledgment of that Licence: It is true, they carried this much further, during the Civil Wars; and this grew to a much greater heighth in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second: But in King <HI>William</HI>'s Time, an Act of Parliament pa&s;&s;ed, a&s;&s;ert|ing the Right of the Crown to <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> laying open the Trade thither to all the Subjects of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> with a po&s;i|tive and con&s;tant Exclu&s;ion of all Aliens and Foreigners: The&s;e were the Re&s;lections on the Treaty of Peace; but there were more important Objections made to the Treaty of Commerce. During K. <HI>Charles</HI> the Second's Reign, our Trade with <HI>France</HI> was often and loudly complained of, as very prejudicial to the Nation; there was a Commi&s;&s;ion appointed in the Year 1674, to adju&s;t the Conditions of our Commerce with that Nation, and then it appeared, in a Scheme that was prepared by very able Mer|chants, that we lo&s;t every Year a Million of Money by our Trade thither. This was then &s;o well received, that the Scheme was entred into the Journals of both Hou&s;es of Parliament, and into the Books of the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e: But the Court at that time fa|voured the Intere&s;ts of <HI>France</HI> &s;o much, preferably to their own, that the Trade went &s;till on 'till the Year 1678, when the Parlia|ment laid, upon all <HI>French</HI> Commodities, &s;uch a Duty as amounted to a Prohibition, and was to la&s;t for three Years, and to the end of the next Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament: At the end of the
<PB N="620" REF="648">
three Years, King <HI>Charles</HI> called no more Parliaments; and that Act was repealed in King <HI>James</HI>'s Parliament: But, during the whole la&s;t War, high Duties were laid on all the Produc|tions and Manufactures of <HI>France;</HI> which by this Treaty were to be no higher charged, than the &s;ame Productions from other Countries. It was &s;aid that, if we had been as often beat by the <HI>French,</HI> as they had been by us, this would have been thought a very hard Treaty; and if the Articles of our Com|merce had been &s;ettled, before the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> was or|dered to &s;eparate his Troops from the Confederates, the <HI>French</HI> could not have pretended to draw us into &s;uch Terms, as they had in&s;i&s;ted on &s;ince that time, becau&s;e we put our&s;elves into their power. We were engaged by our Treaty with <HI>Portugal,</HI> that their Wines &s;hould be charged a third part lower than the <HI>French</HI> Wines; but if the Duties were, according to this Treaty of Commerce, to be made equal, then con&s;idering the Difference of Freight, which is more than double from <HI>Portugal,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Wines would be much cheaper; and the Nation generally linking them better, by this means we &s;hould not only break our Treaties with <HI>Portugal,</HI> but if we did not take off their Wines, we mu&s;t lo&s;e their Trade, which was at pre&s;ent the mo&s;t advantageous, that we drove any where: For be&s;ides a great Vent of our Manufac|tures, we brought over yearly great Returns of Gold from thence; four, five, and &s;ix hundred thou&s;and Pounds a-year. We had brought the Silk Manufacture here to &s;o great Perfection, that about 300000 People were maintained by it. For carrying this on, we brought great Quantities of Silk from <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Turky,</HI> by which People in tho&s;e Countries came to take off as great Quantities of our Manufactures: So that our Demand for Silk had opened good Markets for our Woollen Goods abroad, which mu&s;t fail, if our Manufacture of Silk at home &s;hould be lo&s;t: Which, if once we gave a free Vent for Silk Stuffs from <HI>France</HI> among us, mu&s;t &s;oon be the ca&s;e; &s;ince the Cheapne&s;s of Provi&s;ions and of Labour in <HI>France,</HI> would enable the <HI>French</HI> to under&s;ell us, even at our own Markets. Our Linnen and Paper Manufactures would likewi&s;e be ruined by a free Importation of the &s;ame Goods from <HI>France.</HI> The&s;e things came to be &s;o generally well under&s;tood; that even, while flattering Addre&s;&s;es were com|ing to Court from all the Parts of the I&s;land, Petitions came from the Towns and Counties concerned in Trade, &s;etting forth the Prejudice they apprehended from this Treaty of Commerce. The Mini&s;ters u&s;ed all po&s;&s;ible Arts to bear this Clamour down; they called it Faction, and decried it with a Boldne&s;s, that would have &s;urprized any, but tho&s;e who had ob&s;erved the Methods, they
<PB N="621" REF="649">
had taken for many Years, to vent the foule&s;t Calumnics, and the fal&s;e&s;t Mi&s;repre&s;entations po&s;&s;ible. But the Matter came to be &s;o univer&s;ally apprehended, that it could not be di&s;gui&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of Commons gave an Aid of Two Shillings in the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aid given by the Com|mons.</NOTE> Pound, tho' the Mini&s;ters hoped to have carried it higher; but the Members dur&s;t not venture on that, &s;ince a new Election was &s;oon to follow the Conclu&s;ion of the Se&s;&s;ion: They went next to renew the Duty on Malt, for another Year; and here a Debate aro&s;e, that was kept up &s;ome Days in both Hou&s;es of Par|liament, whether it &s;hould be laid on the whole I&s;land: It was <NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Scots</HI> oppo&s;e their being charged with the Duty on Malt.</NOTE> carried in the Affirmative, of which the <HI>Scots</HI> complained heavily, as a Burden that their Country could not bear: And whereas it was &s;aid, that tho&s;e Duties ought to be laid equally on all the Subjects of the United Kingdom, the <HI>Scots</HI> in&s;i&s;ted on an Article of the Union, by which it was &s;tipulated, that no Duty &s;hould be laid on the Malt in <HI>Scotland</HI> during the War, which ought to be ob&s;erved religiou&s;ly. They &s;aid, it was evident, the War with <HI>Spain</HI> was not yet ended; no Peace with that Crown was yet proclaimed, nor &s;o much as &s;igned: And, tho' it was as good as made, and was every day expected, yet it was a Maxim in the Con&s;truction of all Laws, that odious Matters ought to be &s;trictly under&s;tood, whereas Matters of Favour were to be more liberally interpreted. It was farther &s;aid on the <HI>Scotch</HI> &s;ide, that this Duty was, by the very Words of the Act, to be applied to Deficiencies during the War: So this Act was, upon the Matter, making <HI>Scotland</HI> pay that Duty during the War, from which the Articles of the Union did by expre&s;s Words exempt them. A great number of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were convinced of the Equity of the&s;e Grounds, that the <HI>Scots</HI> went on; but the Majority was on the other &s;ide. So, when the Bill had pa&s;&s;ed thro' the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, all the <HI>Scots</HI> of both Hou&s;es met together, and agreed to <NOTE PLACE="marg">And moved to have the Union di&s;|&s;olved.</NOTE> move for an Act, di&s;&s;olving the Union; they went fir&s;t to the Queen, and told her how grievous and indeed intolerable this Duty would be to their Country, &s;o that they were under a ne|ce&s;&s;ity to try, how the Union might be broken. The Queen &s;eemed unea&s;y at the Motion; &s;he &s;tudied to divert them from it, and a&s;&s;ured them that her Officers &s;hould have Orders to make it ea&s;y to them. This was under&s;tood to imply that the Duty &s;hould not be levied; but they knew this could not be depended on: So the Motion was made in the Hou&s;e of Lords, and mo&s;t of the Lords of that Nation &s;poke to it: They &s;et forth all the Hard&s;hips, that they lay under &s;ince the Union; they had no more a Council in <HI>Scotland;</HI> their Peers at pre&s;ent were the only Per&s;ons in the whole I&s;land, that were judged incapable of
<PB N="622" REF="650">
Peerage by De&s;cent; their Laws were altered in Matters of the highe&s;t Importance, particularly in Matters of Trea&s;on; and now an Impo&s;ition was to be laid on their Malt, which mu&s;t prove an intolerable Burden to the Poor of that Country, and force them to drink Water. Upon all the&s;e Rea&s;ons they moved for liberty to bring in a Bill, to di&s;&s;olve the Union, in which they would give full Security, for maintaining the Queen's Preroga|tive, and for &s;ecuring the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion. This was op|po&s;ed with much Zeal by the Mini&s;ters, but was &s;upported by others; who, tho' they did not intend to give up the Union, yet thought it rea&s;onable to give a Hearing to this Motion, that they might &s;ee how far the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion could be &s;ecured, in ca&s;e it &s;hould be entertained; but the Majority were for reject|ing the Motion: When the Malt-Bill was brought up to the Lords, there was &s;uch an oppo&s;ition made to it, that fifty-&s;ix voted again&s;t it, but &s;ixty-four were for it, and &s;o it pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Matter of the greate&s;t Con&s;equence in this Se&s;&s;ion was, a <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Bill for rendring the Treaty of Commerce with <HI>France</HI> effectual.</NOTE> Bill for &s;ettling the Commerce with <HI>France,</HI> according to the Treaty, and for taking off the Prohibitions and high Duties, that were laid on the Productions of <HI>France.</HI> The Traders in the City of <HI>London,</HI> and Tho&s;e in all the other Parts of <HI>England</HI> were alarmed, with the great Prejudice this would bring on the whole Nation. The <HI>Turkey</HI> Company, tho&s;e that traded to <HI>Portugal</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> and all who were concerned in the Woollen and Silk Manufactures, appeared before both Hou&s;es, and &s;et forth the great Mi&s;chief, that a Commerce with <HI>France,</HI> on the foot of the Treaty, would bring upon the Nation; while none appeared on the other &s;ide, to an&s;wer their Arguments, or to &s;et forth the Advantage of &s;uch a Commerce. It was manife&s;t, that none of the trading Bodies had been con&s;ulted in it; and the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners for Trade and Plantations had made very material Ob&s;ervations on the fir&s;t Project, which was &s;ent to them for their Opinion: And afterwards, when this pre&s;ent Project was formed, it was al&s;o tran&s;mitted to that Board by the Queen's Order, and they were required to make their Remarks on it: but <HI>Arthur Moor,</HI> who had ri&s;en up from being a Footman without any Education, to be a great Dealer in Trade, and was the Per&s;on of that Board, in whom the Lord Trea&s;urer confided mo&s;t, moved that they might fir&s;t read it every one a-part, and then debate it; and he de&s;ired to have the fir&s;t Peru&s;al: So he took it away, and never brought it back to them, but gave it to the Lord <HI>Bolingbroke,</HI> who carried it to <HI>Paris,</HI> and there it was &s;ettled. The Bill was very feebly maintained by tho&s;e who ar|gued for it; yet the Majority went with the Bill 'till the la&s;t day;
<PB N="623" REF="651">
and then the oppo&s;ition to it was &s;o &s;trong, that the Mini&s;ters &s;eemed inclined to let it fall: But it was not then known, whe|ther this was only a Feint, or whether the In&s;tances of the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, and the Engagements, that our Mini&s;ters were un|der to that Court, prevailed for carrying it on. It was brought to the la&s;t Step; and then a great many of tho&s;e, who had hitherto gone along with the Court, broke from them in this Matter, and be&s;tirred them&s;elves &s;o effectually, that when it came to the la&s;t Di|vi&s;ion, 185 were for the Bill, and 194 were again&s;t it: By &s;o &s;mall a Majority was a Bill of &s;uch great Importance lo&s;t. But the Hou&s;e of Commons, to &s;often the ill Con&s;tructions that might be made of their rejecting this Bill, made an Addre&s;s to the Queen, in which they thanked her for the Peace &s;he had concluded, and for the Foundation laid for &s;ettling our Commerce; and prayed her to name Commi&s;&s;aries to regulate and fini&s;h that Matter.</P>
<P>To this the Queen &s;ent an An&s;wer, of a &s;ingular Compo&s;ition: She &s;aid, &s;he was glad to &s;ee they were &s;o well plea&s;ed with the Treaty of Peace and Commerce, that &s;he had made, and a&s;&s;ured them that &s;he would u&s;e her be&s;t Endeavours to &s;ee all the Ad|vantages, that &s;he had &s;tipulated for her Subjects, performed: This was &s;urprizing, &s;ince the Hou&s;e of Commons had &s;uffi|ciently &s;hewed, how little they were plea&s;ed with the Treaty of Commerce, by their rejecting the Bill, that was offered to con|firm it; and this was in&s;inuated in their Addre&s;s it&s;elf: But it was plea&s;antly &s;aid, that the Queen an&s;wered them, according to what ought to have been in their Addre&s;s, and not according to what was in it; be&s;ides it was ob&s;ervable, that her Promi&s;e, to maintain what was already &s;tipulated, did not at all an&s;wer the Prayer of their Addre&s;s. This was all that pa&s;&s;ed in this Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament with relation to the Peace. It was once apprehended, that the Mini&s;ters would have moved for an Act, or at lea&s;t for an Addre&s;s, approving the Peace: and upon that I prepared a Speech, which I intended to make on the Subject: It was the only Speech, that I ever prepared beforehand; but &s;ince that Matter was never brought into the Hou&s;e, I had no occa&s;ion to make it; yet I think proper to in&s;ert it here, that I may deliver down my Thoughts of this great Tran&s;action to Po&s;terity.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;MY LORDS, this Matter now before you, as it is of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Speech I prepared when the Approba|tion of the Peace &s;hould be moved in the Hou&s;e of Lords.</NOTE> greate&s;t Importance, &s;o it may be &s;een in very different Lights; I will not meddle with the Political View of it; I leave that to Per&s;ons, who can judge and &s;peak of it much better than I can: I will only offer to you what appears to me, when I con&s;ider it, with relation to the Rules of

Morality and Religion; in this I am &s;ure I act within my proper Sphere. Some things &s;tick &s;o with me, that I could have no Quiet in my Con&s;cience, nor think I had an&s;wered the Duty of my Function, if I did not make u&s;e of the Freedom of Speech, that our Con&s;titution and the Privileges of this Hou&s;e allow me: I am the more encouraged to do this, becau&s;e the bringing tho&s;e of our Order into Publick Councils, in which we have now &s;uch a &s;hare, was originally intended for this very end, that we &s;hould offer &s;uch Con&s;iderations, as ari&s;e from the Rules of our Holy Religion, in all Matters that may come before us. In the opening my Sen&s;e of things, I may be forced to u&s;e &s;ome Words, that may perhaps appear &s;evere: I cannot help it, if the Nature of the&s;e Affairs is &s;uch, that I cannot &s;peak plainly of them, in a &s;ofter &s;train: I intend not to reflect on any Per&s;on: And I am &s;ure I have &s;uch a pro|found Re&s;pect for the Queen, that no part of what I may &s;ay, can be under&s;tood to reflect on her in any &s;ort: Her Inten|tions are, no doubt, as &s;he declares them to be, all for the Good and Happine&s;s of her People; but it is not to be &s;up|po&s;ed, that &s;he can read long Treaties, or carry the Articles of them in her Memory: So if things have been either concealed from her, or mi&s;repre&s;ented to her, <HI>She can do no Wrong:</HI> And, if any &s;uch thing has been done, we know on whom our Con&s;titution lays the Blame.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The Treaties that were made &s;ome Years ago with our Allies are in print; both the Grand Alliance, and &s;ome &s;ub&s;equent ones: We &s;ee many things in the&s;e, that are not provided for by this Peace; it was in particular &s;tipulated, that no Peace &s;hould be treated, much le&s;s concluded, without the Con&s;ent of the Allies. But, before I make any Ob&s;ervations on this, I mu&s;t de&s;ire you will con&s;ider how &s;acred a thing the publick Faith, that is engaged in Treaties and Alliances, &s;hould be e&s;teemed.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;I hope, I need not tell you, that even Heathen Nations va|lued them&s;elves upon their Fidelity, in a punctual ob&s;erving of all their Treaties, and with how much Infamy they branded the Violation of them: If we con&s;ider that, which Revealed Religion teaches us to know, that Man was made after the Image of God, the God of all Truth, as we know who is the Father of Lyes; <HI>God hates the deceitful Man, in who&s;e Mouth there is no Faithfulne&s;s.</HI> In that le&s;s perfect Religion of the <HI>Jews,</HI> when the <HI>Gibconites</HI> had, by a fraudulent Proceeding, drawn <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> and the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> into a League with them, it was &s;acredly ob&s;erved; and the Violation of it, &s;ome Ages

<P><Q>&startq;The Popes had for &s;ome Ages po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of a Power, to which they had often recour&s;e, of di&s;&s;olving the Faith of Treaties, and the Obligation of Oaths: The famous, but fatal Story of <HI>Ladi&s;laus,</HI> King of <HI>Hungary,</HI> breaking his Faith to <HI>Amurath</HI> the <HI>Turk,</HI> by virtue of a Papal Di&s;pen&s;ation, is well known. Oneof the la&s;t publick Acts of this &s;ort was, when Pope <HI>Clement</HI> the Seventh ab&s;olved <HI>Francis</HI> the Fir&s;t, from the Treaty made and &s;worn to at <HI>Madrid,</HI> while he was Pri|&s;oner there: The &s;evere Revenge that <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth took of this, in the Sack of <HI>Rome,</HI> and in keeping that Pope for &s;ome Months a Pri&s;oner, has made Popes more cautious, &s;ince that time, than they were formerly: This al&s;o drew &s;uch heavy but ju&s;t Reproaches, on the Papacy, from the Reformers, that &s;ome &s;top &s;eems now to be put to &s;uch a barefaced Protection of Per|jury. But the late King told me, that he under&s;tood from the <HI>German</HI> Prote&s;tant Princes, that they believed the Confe&s;&s;ors of Popi&s;h Princes had Faculties from <HI>Rome,</HI> for doing this as ef|fectually, tho' more &s;ecretly: He added, that they knew it went for a Maxim among Popi&s;h Princes, that their Word and Faith bound them as they were Men, and Members of Society; but that their Oaths, being Acts of Religion, were &s;ubject to the Direction of their Confe&s;&s;ors; and that they, apprehending this, did, in all their Treaties with the Princes of that Religion, depend upon their Honour, but never asked the Confirmation of an Oath, which had been the Practice of former Ages. The Prote&s;tants of <HI>France</HI> thought they had gained an additional Security, for ob&s;erving the Edict of <HI>Nantes,</HI> when the &s;wearing to ob&s;erve it was made a part of the Coronation Oath: But it is probable, this very thing undermined and ruined it.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>&startq;Grotius, Puffendorf,</HI> and others who have wrote of the Law of Nations, lay this down for a rule, that the Nature of a Treaty, and the Tie that ari&s;es out of it, is not altered by the having or not having an Oath; the Oath &s;erves only to heighten

the Obligation. They do al&s;o agree in this, that Confederacies do not bind States, to carry on a War to their <HI>Utter Ruin;</HI> but that Princes and States are bound to u&s;e their <HI>Utmo&s;t Efforts,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Pernicies, Summus Conatus.</NOTE> in maintaining them: And it is agreed by all, who have treated of the&s;e Matters, that the common Enemy, by offering to any one Confederate all his Preten&s;ions, cannot ju&s;tify <HI>his</HI> departing from the Confederacy; becau&s;e it was entered into with that View, that all the Preten&s;ions, upon which the Confederacy was made, &s;hould be in&s;i&s;ted on or departed from, by common Con&s;ent.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;It is true, that in Confederacies, where Allies are bound to the Performance of &s;everal Articles, as to their <HI>Quota's</HI> or Shares, if any one fails in the Part he was bound to, the other Confederates have a right to demand a Reparation for his Non|performance: But even in that ca&s;e, Allies are to act as Friends, by making Allowances for what could not be helped, and not as Enemies by taking Advantages, on de&s;ign to di&s;en|gage them from their Allies. It is certain, Allies forfeit their Right to the Alliance, if they do not perform their Part: But the Failure mu&s;t be evident, and an Expo&s;tulation mu&s;t be fir&s;t made: And, if upon Satisfaction demanded, it is not given, then a Prote&s;tation &s;hould be made, of &s;uch Non-per|formance; and the re&s;t of the Confederates are at liberty, as to him who fails on his part: The&s;e are reckoned among the Cu&s;toms and Laws of Nations: And, &s;ince nothing of this kind has been done, I cannot &s;ee how it can be made out, that the Tie of the Confederacy, and by con&s;equence, that the Publick Faith has not been fir&s;t broken on our &s;ide.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;My Lords, I cannot reconcile the carrying on a Treaty with the <HI>French,</HI> without the Knowledge and Concurrence of the other Confederate States and Princes, and the concluding it, without the Con&s;ent of the Emperor, the principal Confede|rate, not to mention the vi&s;ible Unea&s;ine&s;s that has appeared in the others, who &s;eem to have been forced to con&s;ent, by De|clarations, if not by Threatnings, from hence: I &s;ay, I cannot reconcile this, with the Articles of the Grand Alliance, and the other later Treaties, that are in Print: This &s;eems to come within the Charge of the Prophet again&s;t tho&s;e <HI>who deal treache|rou&s;ly, with tho&s;e who had not dealt treacherou&s;ly with them;</HI> upon which, the Threatening that follows may be ju&s;tly ap|prehended: It will have a &s;trange Sound among all Chri&s;tians, but more particularly among the Reformed, when it is reported, that the Plenipotentiary of the Head of the Reformed Princes, &s;aid openly to the other Plenipotentiaries, that the Qeeen held

her&s;elf free from all her Treaties and Alliances: If this be &s;et for a Precedent, here is a &s;hort way of di&s;pen&s;ing with the Publick Faith; and if this was &s;poken by one of our Prelates, I am afraid it will leave a heavy Reproach on our Church; and, to &s;peak freely, I am afraid it will draw a much heavier Cur&s;e after it. My Lords, there is a God in Heaven, who will judge all the World, without re&s;pect of Per&s;ons: Nothing can pro&s;per without his Ble&s;&s;ing: He can bla&s;t all the Coun&s;els of Men, when laid in Fraud and Deceit, how cunningly &s;oever they may be either contrived or di&s;gui&s;ed: And I mu&s;t think that a Peace made, in oppo&s;ition to the expre&s;s Words of &s;o many Treaties, will prove a Cur&s;e in&s;tead of a Ble&s;&s;ing to us: God is provoked by &s;uch Proceedings, to pour heavy Judg|ments on us, for the Violation of a Faith &s;o often given, which is &s;o openly broken: By this our Nation is di&s;honoured, and our Church di&s;graced: And I dread to think, what the Con|&s;equence of tho&s;e things is like to prove. I would not have expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf in &s;uch a manner, if I had not thought, that I was bound to it by the Duty that I owe to Almighty God, by my Zeal for the Queen, and the Church, and by my Love to my Country. Upon &s;o great an occa&s;ion, I think my Po&s;t in the Church and in this Hou&s;e lays me under the &s;tricte&s;t Obligations to di&s;charge my Con&s;cience, and to &s;peak plainly without Fear or Flattery, let the effect of it, as to my&s;elf, be what it will: I &s;hall have the more quiet in my own Mind, both living and dying, for having done that, which &s;eemed to me an indi&s;pen&s;able Duty.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;I hope this Hou&s;e will not bring upon them&s;elves and the Nation, the Blame and Guilt of approving that, which &s;eems to be much more ju&s;tly cen&s;urable: The Reproach that may belong to this Treaty, and the Judgments of God, that may follow on it, are now what a few only are concerned in. A national Approbation is a thing of another nature, the pub|lick Breach of Faith, in the Attack that was made on the <HI>Smyrna</HI> Fleet forty Years ago, brought a great Load of Infamy on tho&s;e, who advi&s;ed and directed it; but they were more mode&s;t than to ask a publick Approbation of &s;o opprobrious a Fact: It lay on a few; and the Nation was not drawn in to a &s;hare in the Guilt of that, which was then univer&s;ally de|te&s;ted, tho' it was pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence: It &s;eems enough, if not too much, to be &s;ilent on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion. I can carry my Compliances no further.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><PB N="628" REF="656">
I now go on with the Account what was farther done in this Se&s;|&s;ion: The Hou&s;e of Commons was, as to all other things except the <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Demand of Money for the Civil Li&s;t Debts.</NOTE> Matter of Commerce, &s;o entirely in the hands of the Mini&s;ters, that they ventured on a new Demand, of a very extraordinary nature, which was made in as extraordinary a manner. The Ci|vil Li&s;t, which was e&s;timated at 600,000 <HI>l.</HI> a-year, and was given for the ordinary Support of the Government, did far ex|ceed it: And this was &s;o evident that, during the three fir&s;t Years of the Queen's Reign, 100,000 <HI>l.</HI> was every Year applied to the War; 200,000 <HI>l.</HI> was laid out in building of <HI>Blenheim</HI> Hou&s;e, and the entertaining the <HI>Palatines</HI> had co&s;t the Queen 100,000 <HI>l.</HI> So that here was apparently a large Overplus, beyond what was nece&s;&s;ary towards the Support of the Government. Yet the&s;e extraordinary Expences had put the ordinary Payments into &s;uch an Arrear, that at <HI>Mid&s;ummer</HI> 1710, the Queen owed 510,000 <HI>l.</HI> But upon a new Account, this was brought to be 80,000 <HI>l.</HI> le&s;s; and at that time, there was an Arrear of 190,000 <HI>l.</HI> due to the Civil Li&s;t; the&s;e two Sums together amounting to 270,000 <HI>l.</HI> the Debt that remained was but 240,000 <HI>l.</HI> Yet now, in the end of the Se&s;&s;ion, when, upon the rejecting the Bill of Com|merce, mo&s;t of the Members were gone into the Country, &s;o that there were not 180 of them left, a Me&s;&s;age was &s;ent to the Hou&s;e of Commons, de&s;iring a power to mortgage a Branch of the Civil Li&s;t, for thirty-two Years, in order to rai&s;e upon it 500,000 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>This was thought a Demand of very bad con&s;equence, &s;ince <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rea&s;ons again&s;t it.</NOTE> the granting it to one Prince would be a Precedent to grant the like to all future Princes; and, as the Account of the Debt was deceitfully &s;tated, &s;o it was known, that the Funds &s;et off for the Civil Li&s;t would increa&s;e con&s;iderably in times of Peace: So an Oppo&s;ition was made to it, with a great Superiority in point of Argument, but there was a great Majority for it: And all People concluded, that the true end of getting &s;o much Money into the hands of the Court, was to furni&s;h their Creatures &s;uffi|ciently, for carrying their Elections.</P>
<P>The Lords were &s;en&s;ible, that the method of procuring this Supply was contrary to their Privileges, &s;ince all publick Supplies <NOTE PLACE="marg">But it was granted.</NOTE> were either asked from the Throne, or by a Me&s;&s;age which was &s;ent to both Hou&s;es at the &s;ame time: This Practice was enquired into by the Lords; no Precedents came up to it; but &s;ome came &s;o near it, that nothing could be made of the Objection. But the Mini&s;ters, apprehending that an oppo&s;ition would be made to the
<PB N="629" REF="657">
Bill, if it came up alone, got it con&s;olidated with another of 1,200,000 <HI>l.</HI> that was before them. And the weight of the&s;e two joined together, made them both pa&s;s in the Hou&s;e of Lords, without oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>While this was in agitation, the Earl of <HI>Wharton</HI> &s;et forth, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Addre&s;s of both Hou&s;es to get the <HI>Pretender</HI> removed from <HI>Lor|rain.</HI></NOTE> in the Hou&s;e of Lords, the Danger the Nation was in by the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s being &s;ettled in <HI>Lorrain;</HI> &s;o he moved, that an Ad|dre&s;s &s;hould be made to the Queen, de&s;iring her, to u&s;e her mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing In&s;tances, with the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> to remove him, and with all Princes, that were in Amity or Corre&s;pon|dence with her, not to receive the <HI>Pretender,</HI> nor to &s;uffer him to continue in their Dominions: This was oppo&s;ed by none, but the Lord <HI>North;</HI> &s;o it was carried to the Queen. The Day after the Lords had voted this, <HI>Stanhope</HI> made a Motion to the $ame purpo&s;e in the Hou&s;e of Commons, and it was agreed to, <HI>Nemine Contradicente.</HI> The Queen, in her An&s;wer to the Addre&s;s of the Lords, &s;aid, &s;he would repeat the In&s;tances, &s;he had already u&s;ed, to get that Per&s;on removed, according to their De&s;ire in the Addre&s;s: This &s;eemed to import, that &s;he had already pre&s;&s;ed the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> on that Subject, tho' the Mini&s;ters, in the Hou&s;e of Lords, acknowledged that they knew of no Applications made to the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and thought the Words of the An&s;wer related only to the In&s;tances &s;he had u&s;ed, to get the <HI>Pretender</HI> to be &s;ent out of <HI>France:</HI> But the natural Signification of the Words, &s;eeming to relate to the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> the Lords made a &s;econd Addre&s;s, in which they &s;aid, they were &s;urprized to find, that tho&s;e In|&s;tances had not their full effect, notwith&s;tanding the Kings of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> had &s;hewed their Compliance with her De|&s;ire, on that occa&s;ion: All the An&s;wer brought to this was, that the Queen received it graciou&s;ly. She an&s;wered the Com|mons more plainly, and promi&s;ed to u&s;e her Endeavours to get him removed. It was generally believed, that the Duke of <HI>Lor|rain</HI> did not con&s;ent to receive him, till he &s;ent one over, to know the Queen's Plea&s;ure upon it, and that he was very readily informed of That.</P>
<P>In the end of <HI>May, Spratt,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> died; his <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Death of &s;ome Bi&s;hops.</NOTE> Parts were very bright in his Youth, and gave great Hopes; but the&s;e were bla&s;ted by a lazy libertine Cour&s;e of Life, to which his Temper and Good Nature carried him, without con|&s;idering the Duties or even the Decencies of his Profe&s;&s;ion: He was ju&s;tly e&s;teemed a great Ma&s;ter of our Language, and one of our correcte&s;t Writers. <HI>Atterbury</HI> &s;ucceeded him in that See,

and in the Deanry of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter:</HI> Thus was he promoted, and rewarded for all the Flame, that he had rai&s;ed in our Church. <HI>Compton,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> died in the beginning of <HI>July,</HI> in the eighty-fir&s;t Year of his Age: He was a generous and good-na|tured Man, but ea&s;y and weak, and much in the power of others: He was &s;ucceeded by <HI>Robin&s;on,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Bri&s;tol.</HI> On the eighteenth of <HI>July,</HI> the Queen came to the Hou&s;e of Lords, to pa&s;s the Bills, and to put an end to the Se&s;&s;ion: She made a Speech to her Parliament, in which, after &s;he had thanked them for the Service they had done the Publick, and for the Sup|plies that the Commons had given; &s;he &s;aid, &s;he hoped the Af|fair of Commerce would be &s;o well under&s;tood at their next Meeting, that the advantageous Conditions, &s;he had obtained from <HI>France,</HI> would be made effectual, for the Benefit of our Trade: She enlarged on the Prai&s;es of the pre&s;ent Parliament; &s;he &s;aid, at their fir&s;t Meeting they had ea&s;ed the Subjects of more than Nine Millions, without any further Charge on them, not to mention the Advantage, which the way of doing it, might bring to the Nation; and now they had enabled her likewi&s;e to pay her Debts: They had &s;upported the War, and &s;trengthened her hands, in obtaining a Peace: She told them, at her fir&s;t coming to the Crown, &s;he found a War prepared for her: And that &s;he had now made her many Victories u&s;eful, by a &s;afe and honourable Peace. She promi&s;ed her&s;elf, that with their Con|currence, it would be la&s;ting: She de&s;ired they would make her Subjects &s;en&s;ible, what they gained by the Peace, and en|deavour to di&s;&s;ipate all the groundle&s;s Jealou&s;ies, which had been too indu&s;triou&s;ly fomented; that &s;o our Divi&s;ions might not endanger the Advantages, &s;he had obtained for her Kingdoms: There were &s;ome (very few &s;he hoped) that would never be &s;a|tisfied with any Government; &s;he hoped they would exert them|&s;elves, to obviate the Malice of the Ill-minded, and to unde|ceive the Deluded: She recommended to them the adhering to the Con&s;titution in Church and State; &s;uch Per&s;ons had the be&s;t Title to her favour; &s;he had no other Aim, but their Ad|vantage, and the &s;ecuring our Religion, and Liberty; &s;he hoped to meet a Parliament next Winter, that &s;hould act upon the &s;ame Principles, and with the &s;ame Prudence and Vigour, to &s;upport the Liberties of <HI>Europe</HI> abroad, and to reduce the Spirit of Faction at home. Few Speeches from the Throne have in my time been more &s;everely reflected on, than this was: It &s;eemed &s;trange that the Queen, who did not pretend to under|&s;tand Matters of Trade, &s;hould pa&s;s &s;uch a Cen&s;ure on both

Hou&s;es, for their not under&s;tanding the Affair of Commerce; &s;ince at the Bar of both Hou&s;es, and in the Debates within them upon it, the Intere&s;t of the Nation did appear &s;o vi&s;ibly to be contrary to the Treaty of Commerce, that it looked like a Con|tempt put on them, to repre&s;ent it as advantageous to us, and to rank all tho&s;e, who had oppo&s;ed it, among the Ill-minded, or at lea&s;t among the Deluded. Nor did it e&s;cape Cen&s;ure, that &s;he &s;hould affirm, that the Nation was by them ea&s;ed of the Load of Nine Millions, without any further Charge, &s;ince the Nation mu&s;t bear the con&s;tant Charge of Intere&s;t at Six <HI>per Cent.</HI> till the Capital &s;hould be paid off. <HI>The Sharpne&s;s</HI> with which &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf was &s;ingular, and not very well &s;uited to her Dignity or her Sex: Nor was it well under&s;tood, what could be meant by her &s;aying, that &s;he found a War prepared for her, at her coming to the Crown; &s;ince &s;he her&s;elf began it, upon the Addre&s;&s;es of both Hou&s;es. It was al&s;o ob&s;erved, that there was not, in all her Speech, one Word of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> or of the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion; but that, which made the greate&s;t Impre&s;&s;ion on the whole Nation was, that this Speech di&s;covered plainly, that the Court was re&s;olved to have the Bill of Com|merce pa&s;s in the next Se&s;&s;ion: All People concluded, the Mi|ni&s;ters were under Engagements to the Court of <HI>France</HI> to get it &s;ettled: And this was taken to be the Sen&s;e of the Queen's Words concerning the making the Peace la&s;ting; what Effect this may have on the next Elections, which are quickly to follow, mu&s;t be left to Time.</P>
<P>I am now come to the end of the War, and of this Parlia|ment, both at once: It was fit they &s;hould bear &s;ome propor|tion to one another; for, as this was the wor&s;t Parliament I ever &s;aw, &s;o no A&s;&s;embly, but one compo&s;ed as this was, could have &s;ate quiet under &s;uch a Peace: But I am now arrived at my full Period, and &s;o &s;hall clo&s;e this Work: I had a noble Pro&s;pect before me, in a Cour&s;e of many Years, of bringing it to a Glorious Conclu&s;ion; now the Scene is &s;o fatally altered, that I can &s;carce re&s;train my&s;elf from giving vent to a ju&s;t Indigna|tion, in &s;evere Complaints: But an Hi&s;torian mu&s;t tell things truly as they are, and leave the de&s;canting on them to o|thers: So I here conclude this Hi&s;tory of above three and fifty Years.</P>

<HEAD>THE CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>_I HAVE now &s;et out the State of Affairs for above half a Century, with all the Care and Attention that I was capable of: I have enquired into all Matters among us, and have ob&s;erved them, during the cour&s;e of my Life, with a particular Application and Im|partiality. But my Intention in writing was not &s;o much, to tell a fine Tale to the World, and to amu&s;e them with a Di&s;co|very of many Secrets and of Intrigues of State; to bla&s;t the Me|mory of &s;ome and to exalt others, to di&s;grace one Party and to recommend another: My chief De&s;ign was better formed, and deeper laid: It was to give &s;uch a Di&s;covery of Errors in Go|vernment, and of the Exce&s;&s;es and Follies of Parties, as may make the next Age wi&s;er, by what I may tell them of the la&s;t. And I may pre&s;ume, that the Ob&s;ervations I have made, and the Ac|count that I have given, will gain me &s;o much Credit, that I may &s;peak with a plain Freedom to all &s;orts of Per&s;ons: This not being to be publi&s;hed 'till after I am dead, when Envy, Jea|lou&s;y or Hatred will be buried with me in my Grave; I may hope, that what I am now to offer to &s;ucceeding Ages, may be better heard, and le&s;s cen&s;ured, than any thing I could offer to the pre&s;ent: So that this is a &s;ort of Te&s;tament or Dying Speech, which I leave behind me, to be read and con&s;idered when I can &s;peak no more: I do mo&s;t earne&s;tly beg of God to direct me in it, and to give it &s;uch an effect on the Minds of tho&s;e who read it, that I may do more Good, when dead, than I could ever hope to do while I was alive.</P>
<P><PB N="634" REF="662">
My Thoughts have run mo&s;t, and dwelt longe&s;t on the Con|cerns <NOTE PLACE="marg">My Zeal for the Church of <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> of the Church and Religion: Therefore I begin with them. I have always had a true Zeal for the Church of <HI>England;</HI> I have lived in its Communion with great Joy, and have pur&s;ued its true Intere&s;ts with an unfeigned Affection: Yet I mu&s;t &s;ay there are many things in it, that have been very unea&s;y to me.</P>
<P>The requiring Sub&s;criptions to the Thirty-nine Articles is a <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Doc|trine.</NOTE> great Impo&s;ition: I believe them all my&s;elf: But as tho&s;e, about Original Sin and Prede&s;tination, might be expre&s;&s;ed more unex|ceptionably, &s;o I think it is a better way, to let &s;uch Matters continue to be &s;till the Standard of Doctrine, with &s;ome few Corrections, and to cen&s;ure tho&s;e who teach any contrary Te|nets; than to oblige all, that &s;erve in the Church, to &s;ub&s;cribe them: The greater Part &s;ub&s;cribe without ever examining them; and others do it becau&s;e they mu&s;t do it, tho' they can hardly &s;atisfy their Con&s;ciences about &s;ome things in them. Churches and Societies are much better &s;ecured by Laws, than by Sub|&s;criptions: It is a more rea&s;onable, as well as a more ea&s;y Method of Government.</P>
<P>Our Wor&s;hip is the perfecte&s;t Compo&s;ition of Devotion, that <NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ Wor|$word$</NOTE> we find in any Church, ancient or modern: Yet the Corrections that were agreed to, by a Deputation of Bi&s;hops and Divines in the Year 1689, would make the whole Frame of our Liturgy &s;till more perfect, as well as more unexceptionable; and will, I hope, at &s;ome time or other, be better entertained, than they were then. I am per&s;uaded they are &s;uch, as would bring in the much greater part of the Di&s;&s;enters to the Communion of the Church, and are in them&s;elves de&s;irable, tho' there were not a Di&s;&s;enter in the Nation.</P>
<P>As for the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Juri&s;diction, it has been the Burden of <NOTE PLACE="marg">And Di&s;ci|pline.</NOTE> my Life, to &s;ee how it was admini&s;tred: Our Courts are ma|naged under the Rules of the Canon Law, dilatory and expen|&s;ive: And as their Con&s;titution is bad, &s;o the Bu&s;ine&s;s in them is &s;mall; and therefore all po&s;&s;ible Contrivances are u&s;ed, to make the mo&s;t of tho&s;e Cau&s;es, that come before them: So that they are univer&s;ally dreaded and hated. God grant that a time may come, in which that noble De&s;ign, &s;o near being perfected in King <HI>Edward</HI> the Sixth's Days, of the <HI>Reformatio Legum Ec|cle&s;ia&s;ticarum,</HI> may be reviewed and e&s;tabli&s;hed: That &s;o Matri|monial and Te&s;tamentary Cau&s;es, which are of a mixed nature, may be left, a little better regulated, to the Lay Hands of Chan|cellors and other Officers; but that the whole Correction of the Manners of the Laity, and the In&s;pection into the Lives and La|bours of the Clergy, may be brought again into the hand of Spi|ritual

It would be well if, after the poor Clergy are relieved by the Tenths and Fir&s;t Fruits, a Fund were formed (of Twenty or Thirty Pound a-year) for the Rural Deans; and that they, with at lea&s;t three of the Clergy of the Deanry, named by the Bi&s;hop, examined into the Man|ners both of Clergy and Laity; and after the Methods of private Ad|monition had been tried, according to our Saviour's Rule, but with|out effect, that the Matter &s;hould be laid before the Bi&s;hop, who, after his Admonitions were al&s;o ineffectual, might proceed to Cen&s;ures, to a Su&s;pen&s;ion from the Sacrament, and to a full Ex|communication, as the Ca&s;e &s;hould require. This would bring our Church indeed into a primitive Form, in which at pre&s;ent the Clergy have le&s;s Authority, and are under more Contempt, than in any Church, that I have yet &s;een. For, tho' in the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> the publick Authority is in general managed, ac|cording to the Method continued among us, yet it was in many particulars corrected by the Council of <HI>Trent;</HI> whereas we, by that unhappy Provi&s;o in the Act, authorizing the Thirty-two Com|mi&s;&s;ioners to reform our Courts, are fatally tied down to all, that was in u&s;e in the twenty-fifth Year of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth. Be&s;ides, in that Church the Clergy have, by auricular Confe&s;&s;ion, but too great an Authority over the People; I am far from thinking that to be a lawful, or even a de&s;irable thing: But &s;ince that is not to be thought of, we are in a woful condition, in which the Clergy are, as it were, &s;hut out from any &s;hare of the main Parts of the Care of Souls.</P>
<P>The want of a true well-regulated Di&s;cipline is a great Defect, <NOTE PLACE="marg">My Zeal again&s;t Se|paration.</NOTE> own'd to be &s;o in the Preface to the Office of Commination: And, while we continue in this condition, we are certainly in an imperfect State. But this did never appear to me, to be a ju&s;t ground of Sepa|tion; which I could never think lawful, unle&s;s the Terms of Communion among us were unlawful, and did oblige a Man to &s;in: That &s;eems to me, the only ju&s;tifiable Cau&s;e of Separation, of leaving the E&s;tabli&s;hed Church, and of &s;etting up a di&s;tinct or oppo&s;ite Communion. Nothing under this &s;eems to be a ju&s;t ground of rending the Body of Chri&s;t, or of di&s;turbing the Order of the World and the Peace of Mankind, thereby draw|ing on that Train of ill Con&s;equences, that mu&s;t and do follow upon &s;uch a disjointing the Society of Chri&s;tians; by which they become alienated from one another, and in the Sequel grow to hate and to devour each other, and by which they are in dan|ger of being con&s;umed one of another.</P>
<P>I do wi&s;h, and will pray for it as long as I live, that &s;ome re|gard <NOTE PLACE="marg">And Ten|de$ne$$ to $span$</NOTE> may be had to tho&s;e Scruples, with which the Di&s;&s;enters are
<PB N="636" REF="664">
entangled: And, tho' I think they are not all well grounded, yet for Peace &s;ake I wi&s;h &s;ome things may be taken away, and that other things may be &s;oftened and explained: Many of the&s;e things were retained at the Reformation, to draw the People more entirely into it; who are apt to judge, e&s;pecially in times of Ig|norance, by outward Appearances, more than by the real Value of things: So the pre&s;erving an Exterior, that looked &s;omewhat like what they had been formerly accu&s;tomed to, without doubt had a great effect at fir&s;t on many Per&s;ons, who, without that, could not have been ea&s;ily brought over to adhere to that Work: And this was a ju&s;t and lawful Con&s;ideration. But it is now at an end; none now are brought over from Popery by this means; there is not therefore &s;uch a nece&s;&s;ity for continuing them &s;till, as there was for keeping them up at fir&s;t. I confe&s;s, it is not advi&s;able, without good rea&s;on for it, to make great Changes in things that are vi&s;ible and &s;en&s;ible; yet, upon ju&s;t Grounds, &s;ome may be made without any Danger. No Inconvenience could follow, on leav|ing out the Cro&s;s in Bapti&s;m, or on laying a&s;ide Surplices, and regulating Cathedrals, e&s;pecially as to that indecent way of &s;inging Prayers, and of Laymen's reading the Litany: All Bowings to the Altar have at lea&s;t an ill Appearance, and are of no u&s;e; the excluding Parents from being the Spon&s;ors in Bapti&s;m, and re|quiring them to procure others, is extreme inconvenient, and makes that to be a Mockery, rather than a &s;olemn Spon&s;ion, in too many. Other things may be &s;o explained, that no ju&s;t Excep|tions could lie to them.</P>
<P>Thus I wi&s;h the Terms of Communion were made larger and ea&s;ier; but &s;ince all is now bound on us by a Law, that cannot be repealed but in Parliament, there mu&s;t be a great Change in the Minds, both of Princes and People, before that can be brought about: Therefore the Di&s;&s;enters ought to con&s;ider well, what they can do for Peace, without &s;inning again&s;t God. The To|leration does not at all ju&s;tify their Separation; it only takes away the Force of Penal Laws again&s;t them: Therefore, as Lying in com|mon Di&s;cour&s;e is &s;till a Sin, tho' no Statute puni&s;hes it; and In|gratitude is a ba&s;e thing, tho' there is no Law again&s;t it; &s;o Sepa|rating from a National Body and from the Publick Wor&s;hip, is certainly an ill thing, unle&s;s &s;ome Sin be committed there, in which we think our&s;elves involved, by joining with that Body, and in that Wor&s;hip: So that the Toleration is only a Freedom from Puni&s;hment, and does not alter the nature of the thing.</P>
<P>I &s;ay not this from any Di&s;like of Toleration; I think it is a <NOTE PLACE="marg">My Zeal again&s;t Per|&s;ecution.</NOTE> Right due to all Men; their Thoughts are not in their own power; they mu&s;t think of things, as they appear to them; their Con|&s;ciences
<PB N="637" REF="665">
are God's; he only knows them, and he only can change them. And as the Authority of Parents over their Children is antecedent to Society, and no Law, that takes it away, can be binding; &s;o Men are bound, antecedently to all Society, to fol|low what appears to them to be the Will of God; and, if Men would act hone&s;tly, the Rule of doing to all others what we would have others do to us, would &s;oon determine this Mat|ter; &s;ince every hone&s;t Man mu&s;t own, that he would think him&s;elf hardly dealt with, if he were ill u&s;ed for his Opinions, and for performing &s;uch Parts of Wor&s;hip, as he thought him&s;elf indi&s;pen&s;ably obliged to. Indeed the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> has &s;ome colour for her Cruelty, &s;ince &s;he pretends to be infallible. But the&s;e Practices are ab&s;urdly unrea&s;onable among tho&s;e, who own that they may be mi&s;taken, and &s;o may be per&s;ecuting the Innocent and the Orthodox. Per&s;ecution, if it were lawful at all, ought to be extreme, and go, as it does in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> to Extirpation; for the bad Treatment of tho&s;e, who are &s;uffered &s;till to live in a Society, is the creating &s;o many Malecontents, who at &s;ome time or other may make tho&s;e, who treat them ill, feel their Revenge: And the Principle of Per&s;ecution, if true, is that, to which all have a Right, when they have a Power to put it in practice: Since they, being per&s;uaded that they are in the right, from that mu&s;t believe they may lawfully exert again&s;t others that Severity, under which they groaned long them&s;elves. This will be aggravated in them by the Voice of Revenge, which is too apt to be well heard by hu|man Nature, chiefly when it comes with the Mask and Ap|pearance of Zeal. I add not here any Political Con&s;iderations, from the apparent Intere&s;t of Nations, which mu&s;t di&s;po&s;e them to encourage the Encrea&s;e of their People, to advance Indu&s;try, and to become a Sanctuary to all, who are oppre&s;&s;ed: But tho' this is vi&s;ible and is confe&s;&s;ed by all, yet I am now con&s;idering this Matter only as it is righteous, ju&s;t, and merciful, in the Principle; for if it were not &s;o well &s;upported in tho&s;e re&s;pects, other Motives would only be a Temptation to Princes and States to be governed by Intere&s;t, more than by their Duty.</P>
<P>Having thus given my Thoughts in general, with relation to <NOTE PLACE="marg">My Thoughts conce$ning the Clergy.</NOTE> the Con&s;titution of our Church and the Communion with it, I &s;hall proceed, in the next place, to that which is &s;pecial with re|lation to the Clergy. I have &s;aid a great deal on this Head, in my Book of the <HI>Pa&s;toral Care,</HI> which of all the Tracts I ever wrote, is that in which I rejoice the mo&s;t: And, tho' it has brought much Anger on me from tho&s;e, who will not &s;ubmit to the Plan there laid down, yet it has done much Good during my

own Life, and I hope it will do yet more good, after I am dead: This is a Subject I have thought much upon, and &s;o I will here add &s;ome things, to what will be found in that Book.</P>
<P>No Man ought to think of this Profe&s;&s;ion, unle&s;s he feels within <NOTE PLACE="marg">An inward Vocation.</NOTE> him&s;elf a Love to Religion, with a Zeal for it, and an internal true Piety; which is chiefly kept up by &s;ecret Prayer, and by reading of the Scriptures: As long as the&s;e things are a Man's Burden, they are infallible Indications, that he has no inward Vocation, nor Motion of the Holy Gho&s;t to undertake it. The Capital Error in Men's preparing them&s;elves for that Function is, that they &s;tudy Books more than them&s;elves, and that they read Divinity more in other Books, than in the Scriptures: Days of Prayer, Meditation, and Fa&s;ting, at lea&s;t once a quarter in the <HI>Ember</HI> Week, in which they may read over and over again both Offices of Ordination, and get by heart tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages in the Epi&s;tles to <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus,</HI> that relate to this Function, would form their Minds to a right Sen&s;e of it, and be an effectual mean to prepare them duly for it.</P>
<P>Ask your&s;elves often (for thus I addre&s;s my &s;elf to you, as if I were &s;till alive) would you follow that cour&s;e of Life, if there were no &s;ettled E&s;tabli&s;hment belonging to it, and if you were to preach under the Cro&s;s, and in danger of Per&s;ecution? For till you arrive at that, you are yet carnal, and come into the Prie&s;t|hood, for a Piece of Bread: Study to keep alive in you a Flame of exalted Devotion; be talking often to your&s;elves, and com|muning with your own Hearts; dige&s;t all that you read care|fully, that you may remember it &s;o well, as not to be at a lo&s;s when any Point of Divinity is talked of: A little Study well di|ge&s;ted, in a good &s;erious Mind, will go a great way, and will lay in Materials for your whole Life: Above all things, rai&s;e within your&s;elves a Zeal for doing Good, and for gaining Souls; in|deed I have lamented, during my whole Life, that I &s;aw &s;o little true Zeal among our Clergy: I &s;aw much of it in the Clergy of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> tho' it is both ill directed and ill con|ducted: I &s;aw much Zeal likewi&s;e throughout the foreign Churches: The Di&s;&s;enters have a great deal among them; but I mu&s;t own, that the main Body of our Clergy has always ap|peared dead and lifele&s;s to me; and in&s;tead of animating one another, they &s;eem rather to lay one another a&s;leep. Without a vi&s;ible Alteration in this, you will fall under an univer&s;al Con|tempt, and lo&s;e both the Credit and the Fruits of your Mi|ni&s;try.</P>

I do affirm this, upon the Ob&s;ervation of my whole Life, that I never knew any one, who conducted him&s;elf by the&s;e Rules, but he was brought into good Po&s;ts, or at lea&s;t into an ea&s;y State of Sub|&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>Do not affect to run into new Opinions, nor to heat your&s;elves in Di&s;putes, about Matters of &s;mall Importance: Begin with &s;et|tling in your Minds the Foundations of your Faith; and be full of this, and ready at it, that you may know how to deal with Unbelievers; for that is the &s;preading Corruption of this Age: There are few Athei&s;ts, but many Infidels, who are indeed very little better than the Athei&s;ts. In this Argument, you ought to take pains to have all well dige&s;ted, and clearly laid in your Thoughts, that you may manage the Controver&s;y gently, without any A&s;pe|rity of Words, but with a Strength of Rea&s;on: In di&s;puting, do not offer to an&s;wer any Argument, of which you never heard before, and know nothing concerning it; that will both expo&s;e you, and the Cau&s;e you maintain; and, if you feel your&s;elves grow too warm at any time, break off and per&s;i&s;t no longer in the di&s;pute; for you may by that grow to an indecent heat, by which you may wrong the Cau&s;e, which you endeavour to defend. In the Matter of My&s;teries be very cautious; for the Simplicity, in which tho&s;e &s;ublime Truths are delivered in the Scriptures, ought to be well &s;tudied and adhered to: Only one part of the Argument &s;hould be in&s;i&s;ted on, I mean, the Shortne&s;s and De|fectivene&s;s of our Faculties; which being well con&s;idered, will afford a great Variety of noble Speculations, that are obvious and ea&s;ily apprehended, to re&s;train the wanton Sallies of &s;ome pe|tulant Men.</P>
<P>Study to under&s;tand well the Controver&s;ies of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> chiefly tho&s;e concerning Infallibility and Tran&s;ub&s;tantia|tion; for, in managing tho&s;e, their Mi&s;&s;ionaries have a particu|lar Addre&s;s. Learn to view Popery in a true Light, as a Con|&s;piracy to exalt the Power of the Clergy, even by &s;ubjecting the mo&s;t &s;acred Truths of Religion to Contrivances for rai&s;ing their Authority, and by offering to the World another Method of being &s;aved, be&s;ides that pre&s;cribed in the Go&s;pel. Popery is a Ma&s;s of Impo&s;tures, &s;upported by Men, who manage them with great Advantages, and impo&s;e them with inexpre&s;&s;ible Severities,
<PB N="640" REF="668">
on tho&s;e who dare call any thing in que&s;tion, that they dictate to them. I &s;ee a Spirit ri&s;ing among us, too like that of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> of advancing the Clergy beyond their due Authority, to an unju&s;t Pitch: This rather heightens Jealou&s;ies and Prejudices again&s;t us, than advances our real Authority; and it will fortify the De&s;igns of profane Infidels, who de&s;ire nothing more than to &s;ee the publick Mini&s;try of the Church fir&s;t di&s;graced, and then aboli&s;hed. The carrying any thing too far does commonly lead Men into the other Extream: We are the Di&s;pen&s;ers of the Word and Sacraments; and the more faithful and diligent we are in this, the World will pay &s;o much the more Re&s;pect and Submi&s;&s;ion to us: And our maintaining an Argument for more Power, than we now have, will be of no effect, unle&s;s the World &s;ees, that we make a good u&s;e of the Authority, that is already in our hands: It is with the Clergy as with Princes; the only way to keep their Prerogative from being unea&s;y to their Subjects, and from being di&s;puted, is to manage it wholly for their Good and Advantage; then all will be for it, when they find it is for them: This will prevail more effectually, than all the Arguments of Lawyers, with all the Precedents of former Times. Therefore let the Clergy live and labour well, and they will feel that as much Authority will follow that, as they will know how to manage well. And to &s;peak plainly; <HI>Dodwell</HI>'s ex|travagant Notions, which have been too much drunk in by the Clergy in my time, have weakened the Power of the Church, and &s;oured Men's Minds more again&s;t it, than all the Books wrote, or Attempts made again&s;t it, could ever have done: And in|deed, the &s;ecret Poi&s;on of tho&s;e Principles has given too many of the Clergy a Bia&s;s towards Popery, with an Aver&s;ion to the Refor|mation, which has brought them under much Contempt. This is not to be recovered, but by their living and labouring, as they ought to do, without an eager maintaining of Arguments for their Authority, which will never &s;ucceed, 'till they live better and labour more: When I &s;ay live better, I mean, not only to live without Scandal, which I have found the greate&s;t part of them do, but to lead exemplary Lives; to be eminent in Humi|lity, Meekne&s;s, Sobriety, Contempt of the World, and un&s;eigned Love of the Brethren; ab&s;tracted from the vain Conver&s;ation of the World, retired, and at home, fa&s;ting often, joining Prayer and Meditation with it; without which, fa&s;ting may do well with relation to the Body, but will &s;ignify little with relation to the Mind.</P>
<P><PB N="641" REF="669">
If, to &s;uch a cour&s;e of Life, Clergymen would add a little more Labour, not only performing publick Offices, and preach|ing to the Edification of the People, but watching over them, in&s;tructing them, exhorting, reproving, and comforting them, as occa&s;ion is given, from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e, making their Calling the Bu&s;ine&s;s of their whole Life; they would &s;oon find their own Minds grow to be in a better Temper, and their People would &s;hew more E&s;teem and Regard for them, and a Ble&s;&s;ing from God would attend upon their Labours. I &s;ay it with great regret, I have ob&s;erved the Clergy, in all the Places thro' which I have travelled, Papi&s;ts, Lutherans, Calvini&s;ts and Di&s;|&s;enters; but of them all, our Clergy is much the mo&s;t remi&s;s in their Labours in private, and the lea&s;t &s;evere in their Lives. Do not think I &s;ay this to expo&s;e you, or to defame this Church; tho&s;e Cen&s;ures have pa&s;s'd on me for my Freedom during my Life, God knows how unju&s;tly, my De&s;igns being all to awaken the Clergy, and by that means to pre&s;erve the Church; for which, He, who knows all things, knows how much and how long I have been mourning in &s;ecret, and fa&s;ting and praying before him. And let me &s;ay this freely to you, now that I am out of the reach of Envy and Cen&s;ure, unle&s;s a better Spirit po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the Clergy, Arguments, (and which is more) Laws and Autho|rity will not prove &s;trong enough to pre&s;erve the Church; e&s;pe|cially if the Nation ob&s;erves a Progre&s;s in that Bia&s;s, which makes many &s;o favourable to Popery, and &s;o &s;evere towards the Di&s;&s;enters; this will recommend them the more to Pity and Fa|vour, and will draw a general Odium upon you, that may end in your Ruin, or in a Per&s;ecution; for which the Clergy of this Age &s;eem to be very little prepared: God grant tho&s;e of the next may be more &s;o.</P>
<P>Oh my Brethren, (for I &s;peak to you as if I were among you,) think what manner of Per&s;ons you ought to be, in all Holy Con|ver&s;ation and Godline&s;s, that &s;o you may &s;hine as Lights in the World: Think of the Account you mu&s;t give, for tho&s;e Immor|tal Souls committed to your care, which were redeemed by the Blood of Chri&s;t, who has &s;ent you in his Name, to per&s;uade them to be reconciled to God, and at la&s;t to pre&s;ent them to him faultle&s;s with exceeding Joy; he &s;ees and ob&s;erves your La|bours, and will recompence them gloriou&s;ly in that great Day.</P>
<P>I leave all the&s;e things on your Con&s;ciences, and pray earne&s;tly that God may give his Ble&s;&s;ing to this po&s;thumous Labour of mine, that our Church may be &s;o built up by your Labours, that it may continue to be long the Joy of the whole Earth, in the Perfec|tion

of its Beauty, and may be a Pattern, as well as give Pro|tection, to all the Churches of God.</P>
<P>I now turn to my Brethren and Succe&s;&s;ors in the Epi&s;copal Order: You are they in who&s;e hands the Government of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">My Advices to the Bi|&s;hops.</NOTE> Church is put; in &s;ome re&s;pects it is believed to be wholly in you, tho' I know, and have often felt it, that your Power is &s;o limited, that you can do little; Exemptions (a &s;candalous Rem|nant of Popery) take a great part of your Dioce&s;s out of your hands. This I have often wondred at, that &s;ome who plead, that the Government of the Church is &s;ettled by Divine Authority in the Bi&s;hops, can yet, by the virtue of Papal Bulls, confirmed by an unhappy Clau&s;e in an Act of Parliament, exerci&s;e Epi&s;copal Juri&s;diction; which is plainly to act by virtue of the Secular Power, in oppo&s;ition to that, which, according to their Princi|ples, is &s;ettled by a Divine Appointment. Archdeacons Vi&s;ita|tions were an Invention of the latter Ages, in which the Bi&s;hops, neglecting their Duty, ca&s;t a great part of their Care upon them: Now their Vi&s;itations are only for Form and for Fees; and they are a Charge on the Clergy; &s;o, when this Matter is well looked into, I hope Archdeacons, with many other Burdens that lay heavy on the Clergy, &s;hall be taken away. All the various In|&s;truments, upon which heavy Fees mu&s;t be rai&s;ed, were the in|famous Contrivances of the Canoni&s;ts, and can never be main|tained, when well examined. I &s;ay nothing to you of your Lives, I hope you are and &s;hall ever be &s;hining Lights; I wi&s;h the Pomp of Living, and the keeping high Tables could be quite taken away; it is a great Charge, and no very decent one; a great Devourer of Time; it lets in much promi&s;cuous Company, and much vain Di&s;cour&s;e upon you: Even Civility may carry you too far, in a Freedom and Familiarity, that will make you look too like the re&s;t of the World; I hope this is a Burden to you: It was indeed one of the greate&s;t Burdens of my Life, to &s;ee &s;o much Time lo&s;t, to hear &s;o much idle Talk, and to be living in a luxurious Wa&s;te of that, which might have been much better be&s;towed. I had not &s;trength enough to break thro' that, which Cu&s;tom has impo&s;ed on tho&s;e, provided with plentiful Bi&s;hopricks; I pray God to help you to find a decent way of laying this down.</P>
<P>The Wives and Children of Bi&s;hops ought to be exemplary in their Apparel, and in their whole Deportment; remembring that no part of the Bi&s;hops Honours belongs to them: The Wife of a Bi&s;hop ought to vi&s;it the Widow and the Fatherle&s;s, and by a grave Authority, in&s;truct and admoni&s;h as well as oblige and fa|vour the Wives of the re&s;t of the Clergy.</P>
<P><PB N="643" REF="671">
The Children of Bi&s;hops ought to be well in&s;tructed, and managed with all Gravity; Bi&s;hops ought not to pre&s;s them be|yond their Inclinations to take Orders: For this looks as if they would thru&s;t them, how unfit or unwilling &s;oever, into &s;uch Preferments as they can give or procure for them: On the con|trary, tho' their Children &s;hould de&s;ire to go into Orders, they ought not to &s;uffer it, unle&s;s they &s;ee in them a good Mind and &s;in|cere Intentions, with the other nece&s;&s;ary Qualifications; in which they cannot be deceived, unle&s;s they have a mind to deceive them|&s;elves: It is a betraying of their Tru&s;t, and the wor&s;t &s;ort of Si|mony, to provide Children with great Dignities and Benefices, only as an E&s;tate to be given them, without a due regard to their Capacities or Tempers. Ordinations are the only Parts of the Epi&s;copal Function, on which the Law has laid no Re&s;traint; &s;o this ought to be heavy on your Thoughts.</P>
<P>Ordination Weeks were always dreadful Things to me, when I remembred tho&s;e Words, <HI>Lay Hands &s;uddenly on no Man, be not Partaker of other Men's Sins: Keep thy&s;elf pure.</HI> It is true, tho&s;e who came to me were generally well prepared as to their Studies, and they brought Te&s;timonials and Titles, which is all that in our pre&s;ent Con&s;titution can be demanded: I never put over the examining them to my Chaplains: I did that always my|&s;elf, and examined them chiefly on the Proofs of Revealed Re|ligion, and the Terms of Salvation, and the new Covenant thro' Chri&s;t; for tho&s;e are the Fundamentals: But my principal Care was to awaken their Con&s;ciences, to make them con&s;ider whether they had a Motion of the Holy Gho&s;t, calling them to the Function, and to make them apprehend, what belonged both to a Spiritual Life, and to the Pa&s;toral Care. On the&s;e Subjects I &s;poke much and often to every one of them a-part, and &s;ome|times to them all together, be&s;ides the publick Examination of them with my Chapter.</P>
<P>This was all that I could do: But alas! how defective is this! <NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ $word$ $word$ con|$span$ng Or|d$nations</NOTE> And it is too well known how ea&s;y the Clergy are, in &s;igning Te&s;timonials: That which I here propo&s;e is, that every Man, who intends to be ordained, &s;hould be required to come and acquaint the Bi&s;hop with it a Year before: that &s;o he may then talk to his Con&s;cience, and give him good Directions, both as to his Studies and the Cour&s;e of his Life and Devotions; and that he may re|commend him to the Care and In&s;pection of the be&s;t Clergymen, that he knows in the Neighbourhood where he lives; that &s;o he may have from him, by &s;ome other Conveyance than the Per|&s;on concerned, &s;uch an Account of him as he may rely on.

<P>As to the Labours of a Bi&s;hop, they ought to think them&s;elves <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duties of a Bi&s;hop.</NOTE> obliged to preach, as much as their Health and Age can admit of; this the Form of ordaining Bi&s;hops &s;ets before them, together with the Sen&s;e of the Church in all Ages; the complaint of the be&s;t Men, in the wor&s;t Ages, &s;hews how much the Sloth and Lazine&s;s of Bi&s;hops will be cried out on, and how acceptable the Labours of preaching Bi&s;hops have always been: The People run to hear them, and hearken to their Sermons, with more than ordinary Attention: You will find great comfort in your Labours this way, and will &s;ee the Fruits of them. The di&s;creet Conduct of your Clergy is to be your chief care; keep not at too great a di&s;tance, and yet let them not grow too familiar: A Bi&s;hop's di&s;cour&s;e &s;hould be well &s;ea&s;oned, turned chiefly to good Subjects, In&s;truction in the matters of Religion, and the Pa&s;toral Care: And the more di|verting ones ought to be matters of Learning, Critici&s;m, or Hi|&s;tory. It is in the power of a Bi&s;hop to <HI>let no Man de&s;pi&s;e him.</HI></P>
<P>A grave but &s;weet Deportment and a holy Conver&s;ation will command a general Re&s;pect; and as for &s;ome hot and froward Spirits, the le&s;s they are meddled with, they will be the le&s;s able to do mi&s;chief; they delight in oppo&s;ition, which they think will make them the more con&s;iderable. I have had much experience this way, nothing mortifies them &s;o much as neglect; the more ab&s;tracted Bi&s;hops live (from the World, from Courts, from Cabals, and from Parties) they will have the more quiet within them&s;elves; their Thoughts will be free and le&s;s intangled, and they will in conclu&s;ion be the more re&s;pected by all, e&s;pecially if an Integrity and a ju&s;t Freedom appear among them in the Hou&s;e of Lords, where they will be much ob&s;erved; and Judgments will be made of them there, that will follow them home to their Dio|ce&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Nothing will alienate the Nation more from them, than their <NOTE PLACE="marg">Th$span$ $word$ $word$ from $word$ $span$</NOTE> becoming Tools to a Court, and giving up the Liberties of their Country, and advancing Arbitrary De&s;igns; nothing will work more effectually on the Di&s;&s;enters, than a cour&s;e of Moderation towards them; this will di&s;arm their Pa&s;&s;ions, and when that is done, they may be better dealt with in point of Rea&s;on; all care ought to be taken, to &s;tifle new Controver&s;ies in their birth, to check new Opinions and vain Curio&s;ities.</P>
<P>Upon the whole matter, Bi&s;hops ought to con&s;ider, that the honour given them, and the Revenues belonging to them, are &s;uch Rewards for former Services, and &s;uch Encouragements to go on to more Labour and Diligence, as ought to be improved, as

<P>But if they abandon them&s;elves to Sloth and Idlene&s;s, if they neglect their proper Function, and follow a &s;ecular, a vain, a covetous or a luxurious Cour&s;e of Life; if they, not content with educating their Children well, and with &s;uch a Competency as may &s;et them afloat in the World, think of building up their own Hou&s;es, and rai&s;ing up great E&s;tates, they will put the World on many unacceptable Enquiries: Wherefore is this wa&s;te made? Why are the&s;e Revenues continued to Men, who make &s;uch an ill u&s;e of them? and why is an Order kept up, that does the Church &s;o little good, and gives it &s;o much &s;candal? The Violences of Archbi&s;hop <HI>Laud,</HI> and his promoting arbitrary Power ruined him|&s;elf and the Church both. A return of the like practices will bring with it the like dreadful Con&s;equences: The Labours and the Learning, the Moderation and good Lives of the Bi&s;hops of this Age have changed the Nation much, with relation to them, and have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them of a general E&s;teem; &s;ome fiery Spirits only excepted, who hate and revile them for that, which is their true Glory: I hope another Age may carry this yet much further, that &s;o they may be univer&s;ally looked on, as the true and tender-heart|ed Fathers of the Church.</P>
<P>The Affinity of the matter leads me, before I enter on another <NOTE PLACE="marg">Concerning Patrons.</NOTE> Scene, to &s;ay &s;omewhat concerning the Patronage of Benefices, which have a Care of Souls belonging to them: it is a noble Dignity in a Family; it was highly e&s;teemed in the times of Popery, becau&s;e the Patron was to be named, in all the Ma&s;&s;es &s;aid in his Church: There is a more real value in it in our Con&s;titution, &s;ince the Pa|tron has the Nomination of him, to whom the Care of Souls is to be committed; which mu&s;t take place, unle&s;s &s;ome ju&s;t and legal Exception can be made by the Bi&s;hop. Even that is not ea&s;y to be maintained, in the Courts of Law, where the Bi&s;hop will &s;oon be run into &s;o great an Expence, that I am afraid many, rather than venture on that, receive unworthy Men into the &s;ervice of the Church, who are in the &s;equel Reproaches to it; and this is often the ca&s;e of the riche&s;t and be&s;t-endowed Benefices.</P>
<P>Some &s;ell the next Advow&s;on, which I know is &s;aid to be le|gal, tho' the Incumbent lies at the point of Death; others do not &s;tick to buy and &s;ell Benefices, when open and vacant, tho' this is declared to be Simony by Law: Parents often buy them for their Children, and reckon that is their Portion; in that ca&s;e, it is true,
<PB N="646" REF="674">
there is no Perjury in taking the Oath, for the Per&s;on pre&s;ented is no party to the Bargain: Often Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks them&s;elves buy the next Advow&s;on, and lodge it with Tru&s;tees for their own Advantage.</P>
<P>Where nothing of all this Traffick intervenes, Patrons be&s;tow Benefices on their Children or Friends, without con&s;idering ei|ther their Abilities or Merit; Favour or Kindred being the only thing that weighs with them. When all this is laid together, how great a part of the Benefices of <HI>England</HI> are di&s;po&s;ed of, if not &s;imoniacally, yet at lea&s;t unworthily, without regard to &s;o &s;acred a Tru&s;t, as the Care of Souls? Certainly Patrons, who, without due Care and Enquiry, put Souls into bad hands, have much to an&s;wer for.</P>
<P>I will not &s;ay, that a Patron is bound always to be&s;tow his Church on the be&s;t Man he can find; that may put him on Anxieties, out of which it will not be ea&s;y to extricate him&s;elf; nor will it be always po&s;&s;ible to ballance the different Excellen|cies of Men, who may have various Talents, that lie &s;everal ways, and all of them may be u&s;eful, &s;ome more, &s;ome le&s;s: But in this I am po&s;itive, that no Patron an&s;wers the Obligation of that Tru&s;t, unle&s;s he is well per&s;uaded, that the Clerk he pre&s;ents is a truely good Man, has a competent mea&s;ure of Knowledge, Zeal and Di&s;cretion, &s;o &s;uited to the People, for whom he names him, that he has rea&s;on to believe, he will be a faithful Pa&s;tor and a prudent Guide to them.</P>
<P>Patrons ought to take this on their Con&s;cience, to ma|nage it with great caution, and in the Fear of God, and not to enter into that filthy Merchandize of the Souls of Men, which is too common; it is like to be a Moth on their E&s;tates, and may bring a Cur&s;e on their Families, as well as on their Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>I do not enter into the &s;candalous Practices of Non-re&s;idence and Pluralities, which are &s;heltred by &s;o many Colours of Law <NOTE PLACE="marg">Non-re&s;i|dence and Pluralities.</NOTE> among us; whereas the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> from whence we had tho&s;e and many other Abu&s;es, has freed her&s;elf from this, under which we &s;till labour, to our great and ju&s;t Reproach: This is &s;o &s;hameful a Pro&s;anation of Holy Things, that it ought to be treated with Dete&s;tation and Horrour: Do &s;uch Men think on the Vows, they made on their Ordination; on the Rules in the Scriptures, or on the Nature of their Function, or that it is a Care of Souls? How long, how long &s;hall this be the peculiar Di&s;grace of our Church, which, for aught I know, is the only Church in the World that tolerates it? I mu&s;t add, that I do not reckon the holding poor Livings that lie contiguous, a Plurality, where both are looked after, and both afford only a competent Maintenance.</P>
<P><PB N="647" REF="675">
I have now gone thro' the mo&s;t important things, that occur <NOTE PLACE="marg">Concerning the Body of the People</NOTE> to my Thoughts with relation to the Clergy: I turn next to &s;uch Ob&s;ervations, Reflections, and Advices, as relate to the Laity. I begin with the Body of the People: The Commonalty of this Nation are much the happie&s;t, and live the ea&s;ie&s;t and the mo&s;t plentifully of any, that ever I &s;aw: They are very &s;agacious and skilful in managing all their Concerns; but at the &s;ame time it is not to be conceived how ignorant they are, in the Matters of Religion: The Di&s;&s;enters have a much larger &s;hare of Knowledge among them, than is among tho&s;e who come to our Churches. This is the more to be wondered at, con&s;idering the Plainne&s;s, in which Matters of Religion are wrote in this Age, and the many &s;mall Books concerning the&s;e, that have been publi&s;hed of late Years, which go at ea&s;y Rates, and of which many Thou&s;ands are every Year &s;ent about, by chari|table Societies in <HI>London,</HI> to be freely given to &s;uch as will but take them, and read them: So that this Ignorance &s;eems to be ob&s;tinate and incurable.</P>
<P>Upon this Subject, all that I can propo&s;e, lies in two Advices to the Clergy: The one is, that they catechize the Youth much at Church, not only asking the Que&s;tions and hearing the An|&s;wers, but joining to that the explaining the Terms in other Words, and by turning to the Bible for &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ages, as prove or enlarge on them: The doing this con&s;tantly, would infu&s;e into the next Age, a higher mea&s;ure of Knowledge, than the pre&s;ent is like to be ble&s;s'd with. Long Sermons, in which Points of Divinity or Morality are regularly handled, are above the Capa|city of the People; &s;hort and plain ones, upon a large Portion of Scripture, would be better hearkened to, and have a much better effect; they would make the Hearers under&s;tand and love the Scriptures more. Preachers ought to dwell often, in their Ser|mons, on tho&s;e Sins that their Hearers mu&s;t needs know them&s;elves guilty of, if they are &s;o; &s;uch as Swearing, Lying, Cheating, Drunk|enne&s;s, Leud Deportment, Breach of Promi&s;e, Love of the World, Anger, Envy, Malice, Pride and Luxury: Short Di&s;cour&s;es upon the&s;e, and often repeated, in many Glances and Reflections on them, &s;etting forth the real Evil of them, with the ill Con&s;equences that follow, not only to others, but to the Per&s;ons them&s;elves, are the be&s;t means can be thought of, for reforming them; and the&s;e will have an effect on &s;ome, if not on many. But above all, and in order to all the re&s;t, they ought to be called on, upon all occa&s;ions, to reflect on their ways, to con&s;ider how they live, to pray in &s;ecret to God, confe&s;&s;ing their Sins to him, begging Pardon and Mercy for what is pa&s;t, and his Holy Spirit to
<PB N="648" REF="676">
a&s;&s;i&s;t, &s;trengthen, and direct them for the time to come, forming &s;incere Re&s;olutions to amend their ways, with relation to every particular Sin, that they find they may have fallen into. If the Clergy will faithfully do their Duty in this method, and join to it earne&s;t Prayers for their People, they may hope thro' the ble&s;&s;ing of God to &s;ucceed better in their Labours. The Peo|ple ought to be often put in mind of the true End of the Re&s;t on the Lord's Day, which is chiefly to give them time and opportu|nity, for Meditations and Reflections on them&s;elves, on what they have &s;aid or done, and on what has befallen them the former Week; and to con&s;ider what may be before them, in the Week they are entring on. Mini&s;ters ought to vi&s;it their People, not only when they are &s;ick unto Death, but when they are in an ill &s;tate of Health, or when they are under Affliction: The&s;e are the times, in which their Spirits are tender, and they will be&s;t bear with a due freedom, which ought to be managed, in the di&s;creet|e&s;t and mo&s;t affectionate manner: And a Clergyman ought not to be a Re&s;pecter of Per&s;ons, and neglect the meane&s;t of his Cure: They have as immortal Souls as the greate&s;t, and for which Chri&s;t has paid the &s;ame Ran&s;om.</P>
<P>From the Commonalty I turn to the Gentry: They are for <NOTE PLACE="marg">O$ the $word$</NOTE> the mo&s;t part the wor&s;t in&s;tructed, and the lea&s;t knowing of any of their Rank, I ever went among&s;t. The <HI>Scotch,</HI> tho' le&s;s able to bear the Expence of a learned Education, are much more knowing: The Rea&s;on of which is this; the <HI>Scotch,</HI> even of indifferent For|tunes, &s;end private Tutors with their Children, both to Schools and Colleges; the&s;e look after the young Gentlemen, Mornings and Evenings, and read over with them what they have learned, and &s;o make them perfecter in it: They generally go abroad a Year or two, and &s;ee the World; this obliges them to behave them&s;elves well. Whereas a Gentleman here is often both ill taught and ill bred: This makes him haughty and in&s;olent. The Gentry are not early acquainted with the Principles of Religion: So that, after they have forgot their Catechi&s;m, they acquire no more new Knowledge, but what they learn in Plays and Romances: They grow &s;oon to find it a modi&s;h thing, that looks like Wit and Spirit, to laugh at Religion and Virtue; and &s;o become crude and unpoli&s;hed In&s;idels. If they have taken a wrong Tincture at the Univer&s;ity, that too often di&s;po&s;es them to hate and de&s;pi&s;e all tho&s;e, who &s;eparate from the Church, tho' they can give no better Rea&s;on than the Papi&s;ts have for hating Hereticks, becau&s;e they for&s;ake the Church: In tho&s;e Seats of Education, in&s;tead of being formed to love their Country and Con&s;titution, the Laws and Liber$span$ of $word$ they are rather di&s;po&s;ed to love Arbitrary

Government, and to become Slaves to ab&s;olute Monarchy: A Change of Intere&s;t, Provocation, or &s;ome other Con&s;ideration may &s;et them right again as to the Publick; but they have no inward Principle of Love to their Country, and of publick Liberty: So that they are ea&s;ily brought to like Slavery, if they may be the Tools for managing it.</P>
<P>This is a di&s;mal Repre&s;entation of things; I have &s;een the Na|tion <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Danger of lo&s;ing Publick Li|berty.</NOTE> thrice, on the brink of Ruin, by Men thus tainted. After the Re&s;toration, all were running fa&s;t into Slavery; had King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second been attentive to tho&s;e bad De&s;igns (which he pur&s;ued afterwards with more caution) upon his fir&s;t Return, Sla|very and Ab&s;olute Power might then have been &s;ettled into a Law, with a Revenue able to maintain it: He plaid away that Game without thought, and he had then hone&s;t Mini&s;ters, who would not &s;erve him in it; after all that he did, during the Cour&s;e of his Reign, it was &s;carce credible, that the &s;ame Temper &s;hould have returned in his Time; yet he recovered it in the la&s;t four Years of his Reign; and the Gentry of <HI>England</HI> were as Active and Zealous, to throw up all their Liberties, as their Ance&s;tors ever had been to pre&s;erve them. This continued above half a Year in his Brother's Reign; and he depended &s;o much upon it, that he thought it could never go out of his hands: But he, or rather his Prie&s;ts, had the Skill and Dexterity to play this Game likewi&s;e away, and lo&s;e it a &s;econd time; &s;o that, at the Revolution, all &s;eemed to come again into their Wits. But Men, who have no Princi|ples, cannot be &s;teady; now the greater part of the capital Gentry &s;eem to return again to a Love of Tyranny, provided they may be the Under-Tyrants them&s;elves; and they &s;eem to be even un|ea&s;y with a Court, when it will not be as much a Court as they would have it. This is a folly of &s;o particular a nature, that really it wants a Name; it is natural for poor Men, who have little to lo&s;e, and much to hope for, to become the In&s;truments of Slavery; but it is an extravagance, peculiar to our Age, to &s;ee rich Men grow as it were in love with Slavery and Arbitrary Power. The Root of all this is, that our Gentry are not betimes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a true Mea&s;ure of &s;olid Knowledge and &s;ound Religion, with a Love to their Country, a Hatred of Tyranny, and a Zeal for Liberty. <HI>Plutarch</HI>'s Lives, with the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Hi&s;tory, ought to be early put in their hands; they ought to be well ac|quainted with all Hi&s;tory, more particularly that of our own Na|tion; which they &s;hould not read in Abridgments, but in the fulle&s;t and mo&s;t copious Collectors of it, that they may &s;ee to the bottom, what is our Con&s;titution, and what are our Laws, what are the Methods bad Princes have taken to en&s;lave us, and by
<PB N="650" REF="678">
what Conduct we have been pre&s;erved: Gentlemen ought to ob|&s;erve the&s;e things, and to entertain one another often upon the&s;e Subjects, to rai&s;e in them&s;elves, and to &s;pread around them to all others, a noble Ardour for Law and Liberty. They ought to under&s;tand Popery well, to view it in its Politicks, as well as in its religious Corruptions, that they may ob&s;erve and guard a|gain&s;t their &s;ecrete&s;t Practices; particularly that main one, that prevails &s;o fatally among us, of making us de&s;pi&s;e the foreign Churches, and hate the Di&s;&s;enters at home. The whole Body of Prote&s;tants, if united, might be an equal Match to the Church of <HI>Rome:</HI> It is much &s;uperiour to them in Wealth and in Force, if it were animated with the Zeal, which the Mona&s;tick Orders, but chiefly the <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> &s;pread thro' their whole Communion: Whereas the Reformed are cold and unconcerned, as well as di&s;|jointed in Matters that relate to Religion. The chief Maxim by which Men, who have a true Zeal for their Religion and their Country, ought to govern them&s;elves, is, to live within the Ex|tent of their E&s;tates, to be above Luxury and Vanity, and all Expences that wa&s;te their Fortunes: Luxury mu&s;t drive them to court Favour, to depend on Mini&s;ters, and to a&s;pire after Places and Pen&s;ions; and as the &s;eeking after the&s;e does often com|pleat the Ruin of broken Families, &s;o in many they prove only a Reprieve, and not a Recovery; whereas he, who is contented with his Fortune, and mea&s;ures his way of Living by it, has ano|ther Root within him; out of which every noble and generous Thought will naturally &s;pring. Publick Liberty has no &s;ure Foundation but in Virtue, in Par&s;imony and Moderation: Where the&s;e fail, Liberty may be pre&s;erved by Accidents and Circum|&s;tances of Affairs, but it has no bottom to re&s;t &s;ecurely on. A knowing and virtuous Gentleman, who under&s;tands his Religion and loves it, who practi&s;es the true Rules of Virtue, without Affectation and Moro&s;ene&s;s, who knows enough of Law, to keep his Neighbours in order, and to give them good Advice; who keeps Meetings for his County, and re&s;trains Vice and Di&s;|order at them; who lives ho&s;pitably, frugally and charitably; who re&s;pects and encourages good Clergymen, and wor&s;hips God, both in his Family and at Church; who educates his Children well, who treats his Servants gently, and deals equitably with his Tenants and all others, with whom he has any Concerns; &s;uch a Man &s;hines, and is a publick Ble&s;&s;ing to all that &s;ee him, or come near him. Some &s;uch In&s;tances are yet left among us; but alas! there are not many of them. Can there be any thing more barbarous, or rather treacherous, than for Gentlemen to think it is one of the Honours of their Hou&s;es,

that none mu&s;t go out of them &s;ober; it is but a little more in|famous to poi&s;on them; and yet this pa&s;&s;es as a Character of a noble Hou&s;e-keeper, who entertains his Friends kindly. Idle|ne&s;s and Ignorance are the Ruin of the greate&s;t part, who, if they are not fit for better things, &s;hould de&s;cend to any thing, rather than &s;uffer them&s;elves to &s;ink into Sloth; that will carry them to the Exce&s;&s;es of Hunting, Gaming, and Drinking, which may ruin both Soul, Body and E&s;tate. If a Man, by an ill-managed or a neglected Education, is &s;o turned, that every &s;ort of Study or Reading is a Burden; then he ought to try if he has a Genius to any Mechani&s;m, that may be an Entertainment to him: The managing a Garden is a noble, and may be made a u&s;eful Amu&s;e|ment; the taking &s;ome part of his E&s;tate into his own hands, if he looks carefully to it, will both employ his Time well, and may turn to a good Account; in a word, &s;ome Employments may be better than others; but there is no Employment &s;o bad, as the having none at all; the Mind will contract a Ru&s;t, and an Unfitne&s;s for every good thing; and a Man mu&s;t either fill up his Time with good or at lea&s;t innocent Bu&s;ine&s;s, or it will run to the wor&s;t &s;ort of Wa&s;te, to Sin and Vice.</P>
<P>I have often thought it a great Error, to wa&s;te young Gentle|men's <NOTE PLACE="marg">$span$ Education.</NOTE> Years &s;o long, in learning <HI>Latin,</HI> by &s;o tedious a Gram|mar; I know tho&s;e, who are bred to the Profe&s;&s;ions in Litera|ture, mu&s;t have the <HI>Latin</HI> correctly; and for that, the Rules of Grammar are nece&s;&s;ary: but the&s;e are not at all requi&s;ite to tho&s;e, who need only &s;o much <HI>Latin,</HI> as thoroughly to under&s;tand and delight in the <HI>Roman</HI> Authors and Poets. But &s;uppo&s;e a Youth had, either for want of Memory or of Application, an incurable Aver&s;ion to <HI>Latin,</HI> his Education is not for that to be de&s;paired of; there is much noble Knowledge to be had in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Languages; Geography, Hi&s;tory, chiefly that of our own Country, the Knowledge of Nature, and the more practical Parts of the Mathematicks (if he has not a Genius for the demon|&s;trative) may make a Gentleman very knowing, tho' he has not a Word of <HI>Latin;</HI> there is a Finene&s;s of Thought, and a No|blene&s;s of Expre&s;&s;ion indeed in the <HI>Latin</HI> Authors, that will make them the Entertainment of a Man's whole Life, if he once under&s;tands and reads them with delight: But if this cannot be attained to, I would not have it reckoned, that the Education of an ill <HI>Latin</HI> Scholar is to be given over. A competent mea|&s;ure of the Knowledge of the Law is a good Foundation, for di&s;|tingui&s;hing a Gentleman; but I am in doubt, whether his being for &s;ome time in the Inns of Court will contribute much to this, if he is not a &s;tudious Per&s;on: Tho&s;e who think they are there,

only to pa&s;s away &s;o many of their Years, commonly run toge|ther, and live both idly and viciou&s;ly. I &s;hould imagine it a much better way, tho' it is not much practi&s;ed, to get a learned young Lawyer, who has not got into much Bu&s;ine&s;s, to come and pa&s;s away a long Vacation or two with a Gentleman, to carry him through &s;uch an Introduction to the Study of the Law, as may give him a full View of it, and good Directions how to pro|&s;ecute his Study in it. A competent Skill in this makes a Man very u&s;eful in his Country, both in conducting his own Affairs, and in giving good Advice to tho&s;e about him: It will enable him to be a good Ju&s;tice of Peace, and to &s;ettle Matters by Ar|bitration, &s;o as to prevent Law-&s;uits; and, which ought to be the Top of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentleman's Ambition, to be an able Par|liament Man: to which no Gentleman ought to pretend, unle&s;s he has a true Zeal for his Country, with an inflexible Integrity and Re&s;olution to pur&s;ue what appears to him ju&s;t and right, and for the good of the Publick: The Parliament is the Foun|tain of Law, and the Fence of Liberty; and no &s;ort of In&s;truction is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for a Gentleman, as that which may qualify him to appear there with Figure and Reputation.</P>
<P>Gentlemen in their Marriages ought to con&s;ider a great many things more than Fortune, tho', generally &s;peaking, that is the <NOTE PLACE="marg">And in Marriages.</NOTE> only thing &s;ought for: A good Under&s;tanding, good Principles, and a good Temper, with a liberal Education, and acceptable Per&s;on, are the fir&s;t things to be con&s;idered: And certainly For|tune ought to come after all the&s;e. Tho&s;e Bargains now in fa&s;hion make often unhallowed Marriages, in which (be&s;ides the greater Evils) more Fortune is often wa&s;ted, than is brought, with a vain, a fooli&s;h, an indi&s;creet and a hated Wife. The fir&s;t Thought in choo&s;ing a Wi&s;e ought to be, to find a Help meet for the Man: In a married State the mutual Study of both ought to be to help and plea&s;e one another: This is the Foundation of all dome&s;tick Happine&s;s; as to &s;tay at home and to love home, is the greate&s;t help to Indu&s;try, Order and the good Government of a Family.

Exteriour, mixed with the&s;e in the capital City; but upon the whole, they are the be&s;t we have: Want of Exerci&s;e is a great Prejudice to their Health, and a Corrupter of their Minds, by rai&s;ing Vapours and Melancholy, that fills many with dark Thoughts, rendring Religion, which affords the true&s;t Joy, a Burden to them, and making them even a Burden to them&s;elves; this furni&s;hes Prejudices again&s;t Religion to tho&s;e, who are but too much di&s;po&s;ed to &s;eek for them. The too con&s;tant Intercour&s;e of Vi&s;its in Town is a va&s;t Con&s;umption of Time, and gives much oc|ca&s;ion to Talk, which is at be&s;t idle, if not wor&s;e: This certainly wants Regulation, and is the Effect of Idlene&s;s and Vanity.</P>
<P>The Stage is the great Corrupter of the Town; and the bad <NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Stage&punc;</NOTE> People of the Town have been the chief Corrupters of the Stage, who run mo&s;t after tho&s;e Plays that defile the Stage and the Au|dience: Poets will &s;eek to plea&s;e, as Actors will look for &s;uch Pieces, as draw the mo&s;t Spectators: They pretend their de&s;ign is to di&s;courage Vice; but they do really recommend it, in the mo&s;t effectual manner. It is a &s;hame to our Nation and Religion, to &s;ee the Stage &s;o reformed in <HI>France,</HI> and &s;o polluted &s;till in <HI>Eng|land. Moliere</HI> for Comedy, and <HI>Racine</HI> for Tragedy, are great Patterns; few can, and as few will &s;tudy to copy after them. But, till another Scene appears, certainly our Plays are the greate&s;t Debauchers of the Nation. Gaming is a wa&s;te of Time, that ri&s;es out of Idlene&s;s, and is kept up by Covetou&s;ne&s;s; tho&s;e who can think, read, or write to any purpo&s;e, and tho&s;e who under&s;tand what Conver&s;ation and Friend&s;hip are, will not want &s;uch a Help to wear out the Day; &s;o that upon the whole matter, Sloth and Ignorance, bad Education and ill Company, are the chief Sources of all our Vice and Di&s;orders.</P>
<P>The ill Methods of Schools and Colleges give the chief Ri&s;e <NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$.</NOTE> to the Irregularities of the Gentry; as the breeding young Women to Vanity, Dre&s;&s;ing and a fal&s;e Appearance of Wit and Behaviour, without proper Work or a due Mea&s;ure of Knowledge and a &s;e|rious Sen&s;e of Religion, is the Source of the Corruption of that Sex: Something like Mona&s;teries without Vows would be a glo|rious De&s;ign, and might be &s;o &s;et on foot, as to be the Honour of a Queen on the Throne: But I will pur&s;ue this no further.</P>

Friend&s;hip nor Party, with a true Under&s;tanding, will for the mo&s;t part direct them in their Judgment, &s;ince few Ca&s;es occur, where the Point of Law is dark or doubtful.</P>
<P>Every Per&s;on of a high Rank, who&s;e E&s;tate can bear it, ought <NOTE PLACE="marg">Of their E|ducation.</NOTE> to have two Per&s;ons to manage his Education; the one a Gover|nour to form his Mind, to give him true Notions, to repre&s;ent Religion and Virtue in a proper Light to him, to give him a View of Geography, not barely de&s;cribing the Maps, but adding to it the Natural Hi&s;tory of every Country, its Productions, Arts, and Trade, with the Religion and Government of the Country, and a general Idea of the Hi&s;tory of the World, and of the various Revolutions, that have happened in it. Such a View will open a young Per&s;on's Mind: It mu&s;t be often gone over, to fix it well. The ancient Government in <HI>Greece,</HI> but much more that of <HI>Rome,</HI> mu&s;t be minutely delivered, that the Difference, between a ju&s;t and a vicious Government, may be well apprehended. The Fall of the <HI>Roman</HI> Greatne&s;s, under the Emperors, by rea&s;on of the ab&s;olute Power, that let Vice in upon them, which corrupted not only their Courts, but their Armies, ought to be fully opened: Then the <HI>Go|thick</HI> Government, and the Feudal Law &s;hould be clearly explained, to open the Original of our own Con&s;titution. In all this, the chief Care of a wi&s;e and good Former of Youth ought to be, to po&s;&s;e&s;s a young Mind with noble Principles of Ju&s;tice, Liberty and Vir|tue, as the true Ba&s;is of Government; and with an Aver&s;ion to Violence and Arbitrary Power, &s;ervile Flattery, Faction and Luxury, from which the Corruption and Ruin of all Governments have ari&s;en.</P>
<P>To this Governour (qualified for all this, to be &s;ought out and hired at any rate) I would join a Ma&s;ter for Languages and other things, in which this young Lord is to be in&s;tructed; who ought to be put under the Direction and Eye of the Governour, that his Time may not be lo&s;t in Trifles; that nothing of Pedantry or of Affectation may be infu&s;ed into a young Mind, which is to be pre|pared for great Things. A Simplicity of Style, with a true and grave Pronunciation, ought to be well looked to; and this young Nobleman ought to be accu&s;tomed, as he grows up, to &s;peak his Thoughts, on the &s;udden, with a due Force and Weight both of Words and Voice. I have often wondered to &s;ee Parents, who are to leave va&s;t E&s;tates, and who &s;tick at no expence in other Things, yet be &s;o Frugal and Narrow in the Education of their Children. They owe to their Country a greater Care in preparing the Elde&s;t, to make that Figure in it, to which he is born: And they owe to their younger Children, who are not to be &s;o plentifully provided, &s;uch a liberal Education, as may fit them to an&s;wer the Dignity of
<PB N="655" REF="683">
their Birth, and prepare them for Employments, by which they may in time give a further Strength and Addition to their Fa|mily. I have been amazed to &s;ee, how profu&s;e &s;ome are, in pro|curing good Dancing, Fencing, and Riding-Ma&s;ters for their Children, and &s;etting them out in fine Clothes; and how &s;paring they are in that, which is the chief and mo&s;t important thing, and which in time may become the mo&s;t u&s;eful, both to them&s;elves and to their Country. I look on the Education of the Youth, as the Foundation of all that can be propo&s;ed, for bettering the next Age: It ought to be one of the chief Cares of all Governments, tho' there is nothing more univer&s;ally neglected. How do &s;ome of our Peers &s;hine, meerly by their Virtue and Knowledge; and what a contemptible figure do others make, with all their high Titles and great E&s;tates?</P>
<P>Noblemen begin to neglect the having Chaplains in their <NOTE PLACE="marg">Of their Chaplains&punc;</NOTE> Hou&s;es, and I do not much wonder at it, when I reflect on the Behaviour of too many of the&s;e; light and idle, vain and in&s;o|lent, impertinent and pedantick; by this want however, the Wor&s;hip of God, and the In&s;truction of Servants is quite neg|lected: But, if a little more care were taken to choo&s;e well, a Lord might make a good u&s;e of a Chaplain, not only for tho&s;e ends, which I have mentioned, but for the reading &s;uch Books, as the Lord de&s;ires to be well informed about, but has not lei&s;ure to peru&s;e him&s;elf. The&s;e he may read by his Chaplain, and re|ceive an Account of them from him, and &s;ee what are the prin|cipal things to be learnt from them, for which he may find lei|&s;ure, tho' not for the whole Book: By this means he may keep his Chaplain well imployed, and may encrea&s;e his own Stock of Knowledge, and be well furni&s;hed with relation to all new Books and new Que&s;tions, that are &s;tarted. The Family of a Noble|man, well cho&s;en and well ordered, might look like a little Court in his Country: For tho' it is a Happine&s;s to the Nation, that the great number of idle and u&s;ele&s;s Retainers, that were about Noblemen anciently, is much reduced; yet &s;till they mu&s;t entertain many Servants, to be either Nu&s;ances where they live, or to &s;et a Pattern to others. The greater Men are, they ought to be the more mode&s;t and affable, and more ea&s;y of Acce&s;s, that &s;o they may, by the be&s;t &s;ort of Popularity, render them&s;elves ac|ceptable to their Country; they ought more particularly, to pro|tect the Oppre&s;&s;ed, to mortify In&s;olence and Inju&s;tice, and to enter into the true Grievances of their Country; that they may repre&s;ent the&s;e, where it may be proper; and &s;hew at lea&s;t a ten|der Care of tho&s;e, who ought to be protected by them, if they can|not effectually procure a Redre&s;s of their Grievances. A continued

Pur&s;uit of &s;uch Methods, with an exemplary Deportment, would &s;oon re&s;tore the Nobility to their ancient Lu&s;tre, from which they &s;eem very &s;en&s;ible how much they are fallen, tho' they do not take the proper Methods to recover it. Have we not &s;een in our Time four or five Lords, by their Knowledge, good Judg|ment and Integrity, rai&s;e the Hou&s;e of Peers to a pitch of Re|putation and Credit, that &s;eemed once beyond the Expectation or Belief of tho&s;e, who now &s;ee it? A Progre&s;s in this Method will give them &s;uch Authority in the Nation, that they will be able, not only to &s;upport their own Dignity, but even to &s;upport the Throne and the Church. If &s;o &s;mall a number has rai&s;ed Peerage to &s;uch a Regard, that the People, contrary to all former Prece|dents, have con&s;idered them more than their own Repre&s;entatives; what might not be expected from a greater number pur&s;uing the &s;ame Methods? The&s;e would become again that, which their Title imports, the Peers of the Crown as well as of the King|dom, of which that noble Right of putting on their Coronets, at the Coronation, is a clear Proof. Great Titles, &s;eparated from the great E&s;tates and the Intere&s;t their Ance&s;tors had in their Countries, mu&s;t &s;ink, if not &s;upported with &s;omewhat of more Value, great Merit and a &s;ublime Virtue.</P>
<P>After I have offered what I think of the greate&s;t Importance to the &s;everal Ranks of Men in the Nation, I go next to con&s;ider <NOTE PLACE="marg">Concerning the two Hou&s;es of Parliament.</NOTE> that augu&s;t Body, in which they are all united; I mean the Parliament. As long as Elections are &s;et to &s;ale, &s;o long we are under a Di&s;ea&s;e in our Vitals, that if it be not remedied in time, mu&s;t ruin us at la&s;t, and end in a Change of Government; and what that may be, God only knows.</P>
<P>All Laws that can be made, will prove ineffectual to cure &s;o great an Evil, till there comes to be a Change and Reformation <NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Flec|tion$&punc;</NOTE> of Morals in the Nation; we &s;ee former Laws are evaded, and &s;o will all the Laws that can be made, till the Candidates and Elec|tors both become Men of another Temper and other Principles, than appear now among them: The Expence of Elections ruins Families; and the&s;e Families will come in time to expect a full Reparation from the Crown; or they will take their Revenges on it, if that Hope fails them: The Commons will grow in&s;o|lent upon it, and look on the Gentry as in their dependance; during the War, and while the Heat of Parties ferments &s;o much, it is not ea&s;y to find a proper Remedy for this. When the War is over, one Expedient in the power of the Crown is, to declare that Elections to Parliament &s;hall be annual: But, if the &s;ame Heat and Rivalry of Parties &s;hould &s;till continue, that would ruin Families but &s;o much the &s;ooner.</P>
<P><PB N="657" REF="685">
The mo&s;t promi&s;ing Expedient, next to a general Reformation, which may &s;eem too remote and too hopele&s;s a Pro&s;pect, is to try how this great Divi&s;ion of the Nation into Whig and Tory may be le&s;&s;ened, if not quite removed: Great numbers on both &s;ides are drawn, to take up many groundle&s;s Jealou&s;ies one of ano|ther, with which Men of hone&s;t Minds are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>There are many of the Tories, that without doubt look to|wards <NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Par|ties of Whig and Tory.</NOTE> <HI>St. Germains</HI> and <HI>France;</HI> but this is not true of the Bulk of their Party. Many Infidels, who hate all Religion and all Churches alike (being only again&s;t the Church of <HI>England</HI> becau&s;e it is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion) do join with the Whigs and the Di&s;&s;enters, and appear for them; from thence the ill-di&s;po&s;ed Tories po&s;&s;e&s;s many of tho&s;e, who are better minded, with an Opinion, that the Whigs favour the Di&s;&s;enters, only to ruin and de&s;troy Religion: And great Multitudes of unthinking and ignorant Men are drawn into this Snare. The Principles of the Whigs lead them to be for the Revolution, and for every thing that has been done to &s;upport and e&s;tabli&s;h that; and therefore tho&s;e who, in their Hearts, hate the Revolution, fortify and promote their De&s;igns, by keeping up a Jealou&s;y of all that Body, which alone can and mu&s;t &s;upport it. The Whigs are indeed favoured by the Di&s;|&s;enters, becau&s;e they &s;ee their Principles are for Toleration, in which, it is vi&s;ible, that the Di&s;&s;enters acquie&s;ce, without pur|&s;uing any De&s;ign, contrary to the E&s;tabli&s;hed Church, into which the far greater number of them might be brought, if but a very few Conce&s;&s;ions were made them. On the other hand, the Whigs, &s;eeing the Leaders of the Tories drive on ill De&s;igns &s;o vi&s;ibly, (endeavouring to weaken the Government, to disjoint the Al|liance, and to put an untimely end to the War, thereby &s;erving the Intere&s;ts of <HI>France</HI> and of the <HI>Pretender)</HI> and that they are fol|lowed in this by the Body of the Tories, who promote their Elections, and adhere to them in all Divi&s;ions in the two Hou&s;es of Parliament, and are united in one Party with them, from thence conclude, that they are all equally concerned, and alike guilty: And thus they are jealous of them all. This Aver&s;ion is daily growing, and will certainly continue as long as the War la&s;ts; when that is ended, it may po&s;&s;ibly abate: but &s;o great a Di&s;ea&s;e will not be cured, 'till a Prince of Spirit and Authority, managed with Temper and Di&s;cretion, undertakes the Cure. We &s;ee Oaths and Sub&s;criptions make no Di&s;crimination, &s;ince the Abjuration, tho' penned as fully as Words can go, has been taken by &s;ome, who &s;eem re&s;olved to &s;wallow down every thing in order to the throwing up all at once, if they &s;hould come to have a clear Majority in Parliament, and dur&s;t lay a&s;ide the Mask.</P>
<P><PB N="658" REF="686">
In the Parliament of 1701, called the Impeaching Parliament, and in the fir&s;t Parliament called by the Queen, there was a Ma|jority of Tories; yet it appeared, the Men of ill de&s;igns dur&s;t not venture to di&s;cover them&s;elves to their Party and to the Nation; &s;o they proceeded with Caution. They de&s;igned in 1701 to have had the Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI> acknowledged, in order to have di&s;graced the late King, and his faithfulle&s;t Mini&s;ters; that &s;o the Princes abroad, who could do nothing without A&s;&s;i&s;tance from <HI>England,</HI> de&s;pair|ing of that, might be forced to &s;ubmit to the Offers <HI>France</HI> made them. In the fir&s;t Year of the Queen's Reign, they dur&s;t make no vi&s;ible Steps that way neither; but they tried to rai&s;e the Heat again&s;t the Di&s;&s;enters, to make a Breach on the Toleration, and to give that Body of Men &s;uch a Jealou&s;y of the Government, as &s;hould quite di&s;hearten Them, who were always the readie&s;t to lend Money to the Publick, without which the War could not be car|ried on vigorou&s;ly. By this it may appear, that many of the Tories have not tho&s;e Views and De&s;igns, that perhaps &s;ome of their Leaders may be ju&s;tly charged with. Now a wi&s;e and an active Prince may find Methods, to undeceive tho&s;e who are thus fatally impo&s;ed on, and led blindfold into the &s;erving the ill De&s;igns of others; e&s;pecially, if he will propo&s;e it, as a &s;ure way to his Favour, for all whom he employs, to procure a better Under&s;tanding and fre|quent Meetings, among the Men of good Lives and &s;oft Tempers in both Parties, who by a mutual Conver&s;ation will &s;o open them&s;elves to one another, that Jealou&s;ies may by this means be ea&s;ily removed. I can carry this no further at pre&s;ent; Men of good Intentions will ea&s;ily find out proper Methods to bring about this worthy De&s;ign of healing a Breach, that has rent the Nation from top to bottom. The Parties are now &s;o &s;tated and kept up, not only by the Elec|tions of Parliament-Men that return every third Year, but even by the yearly Elections of Mayors and Corporation-Men, that they know their Strength; and in every Corner of the Nation, the two Parties &s;tand, as it were, li&s;ted again&s;t one another. This may come, in &s;ome critical Time or other, at the Death of a Prince, or on an Inva&s;ion, to have terrible Effects; as at pre&s;ent it creates, among the be&s;t of each Side, a Coldne&s;s and a Jealou&s;y, and a great deal of Hatred and Virulence among the much greater part.</P>
<P>There are two things of a very Publick Nature, that de&s;erve the Care of a Parliament: The one mu&s;t begin in the Hou&s;e of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The $span$</NOTE> Lords, and the other in the Hou&s;e of Commons. The Law of <HI>England</HI> is the greate&s;t Grievance of the Nation, very expen&s;ive and dilatory: There is no end of Suits, e&s;pecially when they are brought into <HI>Chancery.</HI> It is a matter of deep Study, to be exact in the Law; great Advantages are taken, upon incon&s;iderable
<PB N="659" REF="687">
Errors; and there are loud Complaints of that, which &s;eems to be the chief Security of Property, I mean Juries, which are &s;aid to be much practi&s;ed upon. If a happy Peace gives us quiet, to look to our own Affairs, there cannot be a worthier De&s;ign un|dertaken, than to reduce the Law into Method, to dige&s;t it into a Body, and to regulate the Chancery, &s;o as to cut off the Te|diou&s;ne&s;s of Suits, and, in a word, to compile one entire Sy&s;tem of our Laws. The Work cannot be undertaken, much le&s;s fini&s;hed, but by &s;o great an Authority, as at lea&s;t an Addre&s;s from the Hou&s;e of Lords to the Queen. Nothing, after the War is happily ended, can rai&s;e the Glory of her Reign more, than to &s;ee &s;o noble a De&s;ign &s;et on foot in her Time: This would make her Name facred to Po&s;terity, which would &s;en&s;ibly feel all the Taxes, they have rai&s;ed, fully repaid them, if the Law were made &s;horter, clearer, more certain, and of le&s;s Expence.</P>
<P>The other Matter, that mu&s;t take its ri&s;e in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Provi&s;ions for the Poor</NOTE> is about the Poor, and &s;hould be much laid to heart. It may be thought a &s;trange Motion from a Bi&s;hop, to wi&s;h that the Act, for charging every Pari&s;h to maintain their own Poor, were well reviewed, if not quite taken away; this &s;eems to encourage idle and lazy People in their Sloth, when they know they mu&s;t be maintained: I know no other Place in the World, where &s;uch a Law was ever made. <HI>Scotland</HI> is much the poore&s;t part of the I&s;land; yet the Poor there are maintained by the voluntary Charities of the People; <HI>Holland</HI> is the perfecte&s;t Pattern, for put|ting Charity in a good Method; the Poor work as much as they can; they are humble and indu&s;trious; they never ask any Charity; and yet they are well relieved. When the Poor &s;ee, that their Supply mu&s;t in a great mea&s;ure depend on their Behaviour and on their Indu&s;try, as far as it can go, it will both make them better in them&s;elves, and move others to &s;up|ply them more liberally; and when Mens Offerings are free (and yet are called for, every time they go to Church or to Sa|crament) this will oblige tho&s;e, who di&s;tribute them, to be exact and impartial in it; &s;ince their ill Conduct might make the Givers tru&s;t them with their Charity no more, but di&s;tribute it them&s;elves. If a Spirit of true Piety and Charity &s;hould ever prevail in this Nation, tho&s;e, who&s;e Condition rai&s;es them above the Drudgery of &s;ervile Labour, might employ &s;ome Years of their Life in this Labour of Love, and relieve one another in their turn, and &s;o di&s;tribute among them this noble Part of Go|vernment. All this mu&s;t begin in the Hou&s;e of Commons; and I leave it to the Con&s;ideration of the wi&s;e and worthy Members of that Body, to turn their Thoughts to this, as &s;oon as by a
<PB N="660" REF="688">
happy Peace we are delivered from the Cares of the War, and are at lei&s;ure to think of our own Affairs at home.</P>
<P>One thing more I pre&s;ume to &s;ugge&s;t, which is, that we may <NOTE PLACE="marg">Of &s;horter Se&s;&s;ions of Parliament.</NOTE> have fewer and &s;horter Se&s;&s;ions of Parliament; the &s;taying long in Town both wa&s;tes E&s;tates, and corrupts the Morals of Mem|bers; their beginning &s;o late in the Day to enter upon Bu&s;i|ne&s;s is one great occa&s;ion of long Se&s;&s;ions; they are &s;eldom met, 'till about twelve a-Clock; and except on a Day, in which &s;ome great Points are to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, upon which the Parties di|vide, they grow di&s;po&s;ed to ri&s;e after two or three Hours &s;itting. The Authority of the Prince mu&s;t be interpo&s;ed to make them return to the old Hours of eight and nine; and if, from that time, they &s;ate till two, a great deal of Bu&s;ine&s;s might be di&s;patched in a &s;hort Se&s;&s;ion. It is al&s;o to be hoped that, when the War is ended, Parliaments will not give the nece&s;&s;ary Supplies from Year to Year, as in the time of War, but will &s;ettle Methods for paying the Publick Debt, and for the Support of the Govern|ment, for two, if not for three Years. The ill Effects of an An|nual Meeting of Parliament are &s;o vi&s;ible and &s;o great, that I hope nothing but invincible Nece&s;&s;ity will ever keep us under the Continuance of &s;o great an Inconvenience. I &s;peak of this with the more Concern, becau&s;e this is not only a great Charge on Bi&s;hops, heavy on the richer, and intolerable to the poorer Bi|&s;hopricks; but chiefly, becau&s;e it calls them away from their Dio|ce&s;&s;es, and from minding their proper Work, and fills their Heads too much with Secular Thoughts, and obliges them to mix too much with Secular Company; from which the more ab&s;tracted they are, as their Minds will be purer and freer, &s;o they will be able to follow their own Bu&s;ine&s;s with le&s;s di&s;trac|tion, in a more con&s;tant Attendance on the Mini&s;try of the Word and Prayer, to which, in imitation of the Apo&s;tles, they ought to give them&s;elves continually.</P>
<P>I have now gone over what &s;eemed to me mo&s;t practicable, as well as mo&s;t important, for all Ranks of Men &s;everally in the Nation, as well as for that great Union of them all, in the Re|pre&s;entative of the whole in Parliament: I have not gone into wild Notions of an imaginary Reformation, more to be wi&s;hed than hoped for; but have only touched on &s;uch ill Prac|tices, and bad Di&s;po&s;itions, as with a little Care and good Govern|ment may be in &s;ome mea&s;ure redre&s;&s;ed and corrected. And now, having by all the&s;e, as by &s;o many Steps, ri&s;en up to the Throne, I will end this Addre&s;s to the Nation, with an humble Repre&s;entation to tho&s;e, who are to &s;it on it.</P>

I have had the Honour to be admitted to much free Conver|&s;ation, <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Addre&s;s to our Prin|ces.</NOTE> with five of our Sovereigns; King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, King <HI>James</HI> the Second, King <HI>William</HI> the Third, Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> and Queen <HI>Anne.</HI> King <HI>Charles</HI>'s Behaviour was a thing never enough to be commended; he was a perfectly well-bred Man, ea&s;y of Acce&s;s, free in his Di&s;cour&s;e, and &s;weet in his whole Deportment; this was managed with great Art, and it covered bad De&s;igns; it was of &s;uch u&s;e to him, that it may teach all &s;ucceeding Princes, of what advantage an Ea&s;ine&s;s of Acce&s;s and an obliging Behaviour may be: This pre&s;erved him; it often di&s;armed tho&s;e Re&s;entments, which his ill Conduct in every thing, both Publick and Private, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all thinking People with very early, and all &s;orts of People at la&s;t: And yet none could go to him, but they were in a great mea&s;ure &s;oftned, before they left him: It looked like a Charm, that could hardly be re&s;i&s;ted: Yet there was no Good-Nature under that, nor was there any Truth in him. King <HI>James</HI> had great Application to Bu&s;ine&s;s, tho' without a right Under&s;tanding; that Application gave him a Reputation, till he took care to throw it off: If he had not come after King <HI>Charles,</HI> he would have pa&s;t for a Prince of a &s;weet Temper, and ea&s;y of Acce&s;s. King <HI>William</HI> was the rever&s;e of all this; he was &s;carce Acce&s;&s;ible, and was always Cold and Silent; he minded Affairs abroad &s;o much, and was &s;o &s;et on the War, that he &s;carce thought of his Government at home: This rai&s;ed a general Di&s;gu&s;t, which was improved by Men of ill De&s;igns, &s;o that it perplexed all his Affairs, and he could &s;carce &s;upport him&s;elf at Home, whil&s;t he was the Admiration of all Abroad. Queen <HI>Mary</HI> was Affable, Cheerful and Lively, &s;poke much, and yet under great Re&s;erves, minded Bu&s;ine&s;s, and came to under&s;tand it well; &s;he kept clo&s;e to Rules, chiefly to tho&s;e &s;et her by the King; and &s;he charmed all that came near her. Queen <HI>Anne</HI> is ea&s;y of Acce&s;s, and hears every thing very gently; but opens her&s;elf to &s;o few, and is &s;o Cold and General in her An&s;wers, that People &s;oon find that the chief Application is to be made to her Mini&s;ters and Favourites, who in their turns have an entire Credit and full Power with her: She has laid down the Splendor of a Court too much, and eats privately; &s;o that ex|cept on Sundays, and a few Hours, twice or thrice a Week at Night in the Drawing Room, &s;he appears &s;o little, that her Court is as it were abandoned. Out of all the&s;e Princes Conduct, and from their Succe&s;&s;es in their Affairs, it is evident what ought to be the Mea&s;ures of a wi&s;e and good Prince, who would go|vern the Nation happily and gloriou&s;ly.</P>
<P><PB N="662" REF="690">
The fir&s;t, the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential, and mo&s;t indi&s;pen&s;able Rule for a King is, to &s;tudy the Intere&s;t of the Nation, to be ever in it, and to be always pur&s;uing it; this will lay in for him &s;uch a degree of Con|fidence, that he will be ever &s;afe with his People, when they feel they are &s;afe in him. No part of our Story &s;hews this more vi&s;i|bly, than Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Reign, in which the true Intere&s;t of the Nation was con&s;tantly pur&s;ued; and this was &s;o well under|&s;tood by all, that every thing el&s;e was forgiven her and her Mini&s;ters both. Sir <HI>Simon Dewe</HI>'s Journal &s;hews a Treatment of Parliaments, that could not have been born at any other time, or under any other Admini&s;tration: This was the con&s;tant Sup|port of King <HI>William</HI>'s Reign, and continues to &s;upport the pre|&s;ent Reign, as it will &s;upport all who adhere &s;teadily to it.</P>
<P>A Prince, that would command the Affections and Pur&s;es of this Nation, mu&s;t not &s;tudy to &s;tretch his Prerogative, or be unea&s;y un|der the Re&s;traints of Law; as &s;oon as this Humour &s;hews it&s;elf, he mu&s;t expect, that a Jealou&s;y of him, and an unea&s;y Op|po&s;ition to him, will follow thro' the whole Cour&s;e of his Reign; whereas if he governs well, Parliaments will tru&s;t him, as much as a wi&s;e Prince would de&s;ire to be tru&s;ted; and will &s;upply him in every War that is nece&s;&s;ary, either for their own Pre&s;ervation, or the Pre&s;ervation of tho&s;e Allies, with whom mu|tual Intere&s;ts and Leagues unite him: But tho', &s;oon after the Re&s;toration, a &s;lavi&s;h Parliament &s;upported King <HI>Charles</HI> in the <HI>Dutch</HI> War, yet the Nation mu&s;t be &s;trangely changed, before any thing of that &s;ort can happen again.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t dete&s;table and the fooli&s;he&s;t Maxims, with relation to our Government, is to keep up Parties and a Rivalry among them; to &s;hift and change Mini&s;ters, and to go from one Party to another, as they can be brought in their turns to offer the Prince more Money, or to give him more Authority: this will in conclu&s;ion render him odious and contemptible to all Parties, who growing accu&s;tomed to his Ficklene&s;s, will never tru&s;t him, but rather &s;tudy to &s;ecure them&s;elves, by depre&s;&s;ing him; of which the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the Third of <HI>France</HI> is a &s;ignal In&s;tance. We &s;aw what Effects this had on King <HI>Charles</HI>'s Reign; and King <HI>William</HI> felt what an ill &s;tep he had made, near the end of his Reign, in pur&s;uing this Maxim. Nothing creates to a Prince &s;uch a Confidence, as a con&s;tant and clear Firmne&s;s and Steadine&s;s of Government, with an unblemi&s;hed Integrity in all his Pro&s;e&s;&s;ions; and nothing will create a more univer&s;al Dependance on him, than when it is vi&s;ible, he &s;tudies to allay the Heats of Parties, and to reconcile them to one ano|ther:
<PB N="663" REF="691">
This will demon&s;trate, that he loves his People, and that he has no ill De&s;igns of his own.</P>
<P>A Prince, who would be well &s;erved, ought to &s;eek out among his Subjects the be&s;t and mo&s;t capable of the Youth, and &s;ee to their good Education at home and abroad; he &s;hould &s;end them to travel, and order his Mini&s;ters abroad to keep &s;uch for &s;ome time about them, and to &s;end them from Court to Court, to learn their Language, and ob&s;erve their Tempers: If but twelve &s;uch were con&s;tantly kept, on an Allowance of 250 <HI>l.</HI> a|year, the whole Expence of this would ri&s;e but to 3000 <HI>l.</HI> a-year: By this incon&s;iderable Charge, a Prince might have a con&s;tant Nur&s;ery for a wi&s;e and able Mini&s;try. But tho&s;e ought to be well cho&s;en, none ought to pretend to the Nomination; it ought to ri&s;e from the Motion, of the hone&s;te&s;t and mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted of all his Mini&s;ters, to the Prince in &s;ecret. As great a care ought to be had, in the Nomination of the Chaplains of his Mini&s;ters abroad, that there may be a Breed of worthy Clergymen, who have large Thoughts and great Notions, from a more enlarged View of Mankind and of the World. If a Prince would have all that &s;erve him grateful and true to him, he mu&s;t &s;tudy to find out, who are the propere&s;t and worthie&s;t Men, capable of Employ|ments, and prevent their Applications, and &s;urprize them with be&s;towing good Po&s;ts un&s;ought, and rai&s;ing them higher, as they &s;erve well: When it is known, that a Prince has made it his Maxim, to follow this Method in di&s;tributing his Favours, he will cut off Applications for them; which will otherwi&s;e create a great Unea&s;ine&s;s to him, and have this certain ill effect, that, where there are many Pretenders, one mu&s;t have the pre&s;erence to all the re&s;t; &s;o that many are mortified for being rejected, and are full of Envy at him, who has obtained the Favour, and there|fore will detract from him as much as po&s;&s;ible. This has no where wor&s;e Effects than among the Clergy, in the Di&s;po&s;al of the Dignities of the Church: And therefore Queen <HI>Mary</HI> re&s;olved to break tho&s;e A&s;pirings; which Re&s;olution &s;he carried on effectually for &s;ome Years: A con&s;tant pur&s;uing that Maxim would have a great effect on the Nation.</P>
<P>Frequent Progre&s;&s;es round the Nation, &s;o divided, that once in &s;even, eight or ten Years, the chief Places of it might be gone thro', would recommend a Prince wonderfully to the Peo|ple; e&s;pecially if he were gentle and affable, and would &s;o ma|nage his Progre&s;s, that it &s;hould not be a Charge to any, by re|fu&s;ing to accept of Entertainments, from any Per&s;on what&s;oever: for the accepting the&s;e only from &s;uch, as could ea&s;ily bear the Charge of it, would be an affronting of others, who being of
<PB N="664" REF="692">
equal Rank, though not of equal E&s;tates, would likewi&s;e de&s;ire to treat the Prince. So to make a Progre&s;s every where accepta|ble, and no where chargeable, the &s;ure Method would be, ac|cording to the e&s;tabli&s;hed Rule of the Hou&s;hold, for the Prince to carry the travelling Wardrobe with him, and to take &s;uch Hou&s;es in the way, as are mo&s;t convenient for him; but to en|tertain him&s;elf and his Court there, and have a Variety of Ta|bles for &s;uch as may come to attend on him. On this Q. <HI>Mary</HI> had &s;et her Heart, if &s;he had lived to &s;ee Peace in her Days; by this means a Prince may &s;ee and be &s;een by his People; he may know &s;ome Men, that de&s;erve to be di&s;tingui&s;hed, of whom otherwi&s;e he would never have heard; and he may learn and redre&s;s the Grievances of his People, preventing all Parliamentary Complaints, except for &s;uch Matters as cannot be cured, but by a Remedy in Parliament: Methods like the&s;e would make a Prince become the Idol of his People.</P>
<P>It is certain, that their Affections mu&s;t follow a Prince, who would con&s;ider Government and the Royal Dignity as his Calling, and would be daily employed in it, &s;tudying the Good and Hap|pine&s;s of his People, pur&s;uing the propere&s;t ways for promoting it, without either delivering him&s;elf up to the Sloth of Luxury and vain Magnificence, or affecting the Barbarity of War and Conque&s;t; which render tho&s;e, who make the World a Scene of Blood and Rapine, indeed the Butchers of Mankind. If the&s;e Words &s;eem not decent enough, I will make no other Apology, but that I u&s;e them, becau&s;e I cannot find wor&s;e: For as they are the wor&s;t of Men, &s;o they de&s;erve the wor&s;t of Language. Can it be thought that Princes are rai&s;ed to the highe&s;t Pitch of Glory and Wealth, on de&s;ign to corrupt their Minds with Pride and Contempt of the re&s;t of Mankind, as if they were made only to be the In&s;truments of their Extravagancies, or the Subjects of their Pa&s;&s;ions and Humours? No! they are exalted for the Good of their Fellow-Creatures, in order to rai&s;e them to the true&s;t Sublimity, to become as like Divinity, as a mortal Crea|ture is capable of being. None will grudge them their great Trea&s;ures and Authority, when they &s;ee it is all employed to make their People happy. None will envy their Greatne&s;s, when they &s;ee it accompanied with a &s;uitable Greatne&s;s of Soul, whereas a magnified and flattered Pageant will &s;oon fall under univer&s;al Contempt and Hatred. There is not any one thing more cer|tain and more evident, than that Princes are made for the Peo|ple, and not the People for them; and perhaps there is no Na+tion under Heaven, that is more entirely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with this No+tion of Princes, than the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation is in this Age; &s;o th$span$
<PB N="665" REF="693">
they will &s;oon be unea&s;y to a Prince, who does not govern him|&s;elf by this Maxim, and in time grow very unkind to him.</P>
<P>Great Care ought to be taken, in the Nomination of Judges and Bi&s;hops. I join the&s;e together; for Law and Religion, Ju&s;tice and Piety, are the Support of Nations, and give &s;trength and Security to Governments: Judges mu&s;t be recommended by tho&s;e in the High Po&s;ts of the Law; but a Prince may, by his own Ta&s;te and upon Knowledge, choo&s;e his Bi&s;hops. They ought to be Men eminent for Piety, Learning, Di&s;cretion and Zeal; not broken with Age, which will quickly render them in|capable of &s;erving the Church, to any good purpo&s;e: A Per&s;on fit to be a Bi&s;hop at &s;ixty, was fit at forty; and had then Spirit and Activity, with a Strength both of Body and Mind. The va&s;t Expence they are at, in entering on their Bi&s;hopricks, ought to be regulated: No Bi&s;hopricks can be, in any good degree, &s;erved under 1000 <HI>l.</HI> a Year at lea&s;t. The Judges ought to be plentifully provided for, that they may be under no Temptation, to &s;upply them&s;elves by indirect Ways: One Part of a Prince's Care, to be recommended to Judges in their Circuits, is to know what Per&s;ons are, as it were, hid in the Nation, that are fit for Employments, and de&s;erve to be encouraged; of &s;uch, they ought to give an Account to the Lord Chancellor, who ought to lay it before the Throne. No Crime ought to be pardoned, till the Judge who gave Sentence is heard, to give an Account of the Evidence, with the Circum&s;tances of the Fact, as it appeared on the Trial: no regard ought to be had to Stories that are told, to move Compa&s;&s;ion; for in the&s;e, little regard is had to Truth: And an Ea&s;ine&s;s in pardoning is, in &s;ome &s;ort, an encouraging of Crimes, and a giving Licence to commit them.</P>
<P>But to run out no longer into particulars, the great and comprehen&s;ive Rule of all is, that a King &s;hould con&s;ider him&s;elf, as exalted by Almighty God into that high Dignity, as into a Capacity of doing much good, and of being a great ble&s;&s;ing to Mankind, and in &s;ome &s;ort a God on Earth; and therefore, as he expects, that his Mini&s;ters &s;hould &s;tudy to advance his Ser|vice, his Intere&s;ts and his Glory; and that, &s;o much the more, as he rai&s;es them to higher Po&s;ts of Favour and Honour; &s;o he, whom God has rai&s;ed to the greate&s;t Exaltation, this World is ca|pable of, &s;hould apply him&s;elf wholly to Cares, becoming his Rank and Station, to be in him&s;elf a Pattern of Virtue and true Religion, to promote Ju&s;tice, to relieve and revenge the Oppre&s;&s;ed, and to &s;eek out Men of Virtue and Piety, and bring them into &s;uch De|grees of Confidence, as they may be capable of; to encourage a due and a generous Freedom in their Advices, to be ready to
<PB N="666" REF="694">
&s;ee his own Errours, that he may correct them, and to entertain every thing, that is &s;ugge&s;ted to him, for the Good of his People, and for the Benefit of Mankind; and to make a Difference be|tween tho&s;e, who court his Favour for their own Ends, who &s;tudy to flatter and by that to plea&s;e him, often to his own Ruin, and tho&s;e who have great Views and noble Aims, who &s;et him on to pur&s;ue De&s;igns worthy of him, without mean or partial re|gards to any Ends or Intere&s;ts of their own. It is not enough for a Prince, not to encourage Vice or Impiety, by his own ill Prac|tices; it ought to appear, that the&s;e are odious to him, and that they give him Horrour: A Declaration of this kind, &s;olemnly made and &s;teadily pur&s;ued, would &s;oon bring on at lea&s;t an exte|riour Reformation, which would have a great Effect on the Body of the Nation, and on the ri&s;ing Generation, though it were but hypocritically put on at fir&s;t. Such a Prince would be perhaps too great a Ble&s;&s;ing to a wicked World: Queen <HI>Mary</HI> &s;eemed to have the Seeds of all this in her; but the World was not worthy of her: And &s;o God took her from it.</P>
<P>I will conclude this whole Addre&s;s to Po&s;terity with that, which is the mo&s;t important of all other things, and which alone will <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Exhor|tation to all to become truly Reli|gious.</NOTE> carry every thing el&s;e along with it; which is to recommend, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn and &s;erious manner, the Study and Practice of Religion to all &s;orts of Men, as that which is both <HI>the Light of the World,</HI> and <HI>the Salt of the Earth.</HI> Nothing does &s;o open our Faculties, and compo&s;e and direct the whole Man, as an in|ward Sen&s;e of God, of his Authority over us, of the Laws he has &s;et us, of his Eye ever upon us, of his hearing our Prayers, a&s;&s;i&s;ting our Endeavours, watching over our Concerns, and of his being to judge and to reward or puni&s;h us in another State, ac|cording to what we do in this: Nothing will give a Man &s;uch a Dete&s;tation of Sin, and &s;uch a Sen&s;e of the Goodne&s;s of God, and of our Obligations to Holine&s;s, as a right Under&s;tanding and a firm Belief of the Chri&s;tian Religion: Nothing can give a Man &s;o calm a Peace within, and &s;uch a firm Security again&s;t all Fears and Dangers without, as the Belief of a hind and wi&s;e Providence, and of a future State. An Integrity of Heart gives a Man a Cou|rage, and a Confidence that cannot be &s;haken: A Man is &s;ure that, by living according to the Rules of Religion, he becomes the wi&s;e&s;t, the be&s;t and happie&s;t Creature, that he is capable of being: Hone&s;t Indu&s;try, the employing his Time well, and a con&s;tant Sobriety, an undefiled Purity and Cha&s;tity, with a quiet Serenity, are the be&s;t Pre&s;ervers of Life and Health: So that, take a Man as a &s;ingle Individual, Religion is his Guard, his Perfec|tion,
<PB N="667" REF="695">
his Beauty, and his Glory: This will make him <HI>the Light of the World,</HI> &s;hining brightly, and enlightening many round about him.</P>
<P>Then take a Man as a Piece of Mankind, as a Citizen of the World, or of any particular State, Religion is indeed <HI>then the Salt of the Earth:</HI> For it makes every Man to be to all the re&s;t of the World, what&s;oever any one can with rea&s;on wi&s;h or de&s;ire him to be. He is true, ju&s;t, hone&s;t and faithful in the whole Commerce of Life, doing to all others, that which he would have others do to him: He is a Lover of Mankind, and of his Coun|try: He may and ought to love &s;ome more than others; but he has an Extent of Love to all, of Pity and Compa&s;&s;ion, not only to the poore&s;t, but to the wor&s;t; for the wor&s;e any are, they are the more to be pitied. He has a Complacency and Delight in all that are truely, tho' but defectively good, and a Re&s;pect and Veneration for all that are eminently &s;o: He mourns for the Sins, and rejoices in the Virtues of all that are round about him: In every Relation of Life, Religion makes him an&s;wer all his Obligations: It will make Princes ju&s;t and good, faithful to their Promi&s;es, and Lovers of their People: It will in&s;pire Sub|jects with Re&s;pect, Submi&s;&s;ion, Obedience and Zeal for their Prince: It will &s;anctify Wedlock to be a State of Chri&s;tian Friend&s;hip, and mutual A&s;&s;i&s;tance: It will give Parents the true&s;t Love to their Children, with a proper Care of their Education: It will command the Returns of Gratitude and Obe|dience from Children: It will teach Ma&s;ters to be gentle and careful of their Servants, and Servants to be faithful, zealous, and diligent in their Ma&s;ter's Concerns: It will make Friends tender and true to one another; it will make them generous, faithful and di&s;intere&s;ted: It will make Men live in their Neighbourhood, as Members of one common Body, promoting fir&s;t the general Good of the Whole, and then the Good of every Particular, as far as a Man's Sphere can go: It will make Judges and Ma|gi&s;trates ju&s;t and patient, hating Covetou&s;ne&s;s, and maintaining Peace and Order, without re&s;pect of Per&s;ons: It will make Peo|ple live in &s;o inoffen&s;ive a manner, that it will be ea&s;y to main|tain Ju&s;tice, whil&s;t Men are not di&s;po&s;ed to give Di&s;turbance to tho&s;e about them. This will make Bi&s;hops and Pa&s;tors faithful to their Tru&s;t, tender to their People, and watchful over them; and it will be get in the People an E&s;teem for their Per&s;ons, and their Functions.</P>
<P>Thus Religion, if truely received and &s;incerely adhered to, would prove the greate&s;t of all Ble&s;&s;ings to a Nation: But by Reli|gion,
<PB N="668" REF="696">
I under&s;tand &s;omewhat more than the receiving &s;ome Doc|trines, tho' ever &s;o true, or the profe&s;&s;ing them, and engaging to &s;upport them, not without Zeal and Eagerne&s;s. What &s;ignify the be&s;t Doctrines, if Men do not live &s;uitably to them; if they have not a due Influence upon their Thoughts, their Principles, and their Lives? Men of bad Lives, with &s;ound Opinions, are &s;elf condemned, and lie under a highly aggravated Guilt; nor will the Heat of a Party, ari&s;ing out of Intere&s;t, and managed with Fury and Violence, compen&s;ate for the ill Lives of &s;uch fal&s;e Pretenders to Zeal; while they are a Di&s;grace to that, which they profe&s;s and &s;eem &s;o hot for. By Religion I do not mean, an outward Compliance with Form and Cu&s;toms, in going to Church, to Prayers, to Sermons and to Sacraments, with an external Shew of Devotion, or, which is more, with &s;ome in|ward forced good Thoughts, in which many may &s;atisfy them&s;elves, while this has no vi&s;ible effect on their Lives, nor any inward Force to &s;ubdue and rectify their Appetites, Pa&s;&s;ions and &s;ecret De&s;igns. Tho&s;e cu&s;tomary Performances, how good and u&s;eful &s;oever, when well under&s;tood and rightly directed, are of little value, when Men re&s;t on them, and think that, becau&s;e they do them, they have therefore acquitted them&s;elves of their Duty, tho' they continue &s;till proud, covetous, full of Deceit, Envy and Malice: Even &s;ecret Prayer, the mo&s;t effectual of all other means, is de&s;igned for a higher end, which is to po&s;&s;e&s;s our Minds with &s;uch a con&s;tant and pre&s;ent Sen&s;e of Divine Truths, as may make the&s;e live in us, and govern us; and may draw down &s;uch A&s;&s;i&s;tances, as may exalt and &s;anctify our Natures.</P>
<P>So that by Religion I mean, &s;uch a Sen&s;e of divine Truth, as enters into a Man, and becomes a Spring of a new Nature within him; reforming his Thoughts and De&s;igns, purifying his Heart, and &s;anctifying him, and governing his whole Deportment, his Words as well as his Actions; convincing him that, it is not enough, not to be &s;eandalou&s;ly vicious, or to be innocent in his Conver&s;ation, but that he mu&s;t be entirely, uniformly and con|&s;tantly pure and vertuous, animating him with a Zeal, to be &s;till better and better, more eminently good and exemplary, u&s;ing Prayers and all outward Devotions, as &s;olemn Acts te&s;tifying what he is inwardly and at heart, and as Methods in&s;tituted by God, to be &s;till advancing in the u&s;e of them further and further, into a more re&s;ined and &s;piritual Sen&s;e of divine Matters. This is true Religion, which is the Perfection of Human Nature, and the Joy and Delight of every one, that feels it active and &s;trong within him; it is true, this is not arrived at

all at once; and it will have an unhappy allay, hanging long even about a good Man: But, as tho&s;e ill Mixtures are the per|petual Grief of his Soul, &s;o it is his chief Care to watch over and to mortify them; he will be in a continual Progre&s;s, &s;till gain|ing ground upon him&s;elf: And, as he attains to a good degree of Purity, he will find a noble Flame of Life and Joy growing upon him. Of this I write with the more Concern and Emo|tion, becau&s;e I have felt this the true and indeed the only Joy, which runs thro' a Man's Heart and Life: It is that which has been for many Years my greate&s;t Support: I rejoice daily in it; I feel from it the Earne&s;t of that &s;upreme Joy, which I pant and long for; I am &s;ure there is nothing el&s;e can afford any true or compleat Happine&s;s. I have, con&s;idering my Sphere, &s;een a great deal of all, that is mo&s;t &s;hining and tempting in this World: The Plea&s;ures of Sen&s;e I did &s;oon nau&s;eate; Intrigues of State, and the Conduct of Affairs have &s;omething in them, that is more &s;pecious; and I was, for &s;ome Years, deeply im|mer&s;ed in the&s;e, but &s;till with Hopes of reforming the World, and of making Mankind wi&s;er and better: But I have found, <HI>That which is crooked cannot be made &s;traight.</HI> I acquainted my &s;elf with Knowledge and Learning, and that in a great Variety, and with more Compa&s;s than Depth: but tho' <HI>Wi&s;dom excelleth Folly, as much as Light does Darkne&s;s;</HI> yet, as it is a <HI>&s;ore Travail,</HI> &s;o it is &s;o very defective, that what is <HI>wanting</HI> to compleat it, <HI>can|not be numbered.</HI> I have &s;een that <HI>two were better than one,</HI> and that a <HI>threefold Cord is not ea&s;ily loo&s;ed;</HI> and have therefore culti|vated Friend&s;hip with much Zeal and a di&s;intere&s;ted Tenderne&s;s; but I have found this was al&s;o Vanity and Vexation of Spirit, tho' it be of the be&s;t and noble&s;t &s;ort. So that, upon great and long Experience, I could enlarge on the Preacher's Text, <HI>Vanity of Vanities, and all is Vanity;</HI> but I mu&s;t al&s;o conclude with him; <HI>Fear God, and keep his Commandments, for this is the All of Man,</HI> the Whole both of his Duty, and of his Happine&s;s. I do therefore end all, in the Words of <HI>David,</HI> of the Truth of which, upon great Experience and a long Ob&s;ervation, I am &s;o fully a&s;&s;ured, that I leave the&s;e as my la&s;t Words to Po&s;terity: <Q><HI>&startq;Co$span$e ye Children, hearken unto me; I will teach you the Fear of the Lord; what Man is he that de&s;ireth Life, and loveth many Days, that he may &s;ee Good; keep thy Tongue from Evil, and thy Lips from &s;peaking Guile; depart from Evil, and do Good, &s;eek Peace and pur&s;ue it. The Eyes of the Lord are upon the Righteous, and his Ears are open to their Cry; but the Face of the Lord is again&s;t them that do Evil, to cut
<PB N="670" REF="698">
off the Remembrance of them, from the Earth. The Righteous cry, and the Lord heareth and delivereth them out of all their Troubles. The Lord is nigh unto them, that are of a broken Heart, and &s;aveth &s;uch as be of a contrite Spirit.&endq;</HI></Q></P>

<P>Our Author, Dr. GILBERT BURNET, was born at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> on the eighteenth Day of <HI>September</HI> in the Year 1643. His Fa|ther <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Au|thor's Birth and Pa|rentage.</NOTE> was the younger Brother of a Family, very con&s;iderable for its Antiquity as well as Intere&s;t, in the Shire of <HI>Aberdeen;</HI> and was bred to the Civil Law, which he &s;tudied for &s;even Years in <HI>France.</HI> His exce&s;&s;ive Mode&s;ty &s;o far depre&s;s'd his Abilities, that he never made a &s;hining Figure at the Bar, tho' he was univer&s;ally e&s;teemed a Man of Judgment and Knowledge in his Profe&s;&s;ion; he was eminent for Probity and Genero&s;ity in his Practice; in&s;o|much that near one half of it went in Acts of Charity and Friend|&s;hip: From the Poor he never took a Fee, nor from a Clergy|man, when he &s;ued in the Right of his Church. In the Year 1637, when the Troubles in <HI>Scotland</HI> were breaking out, he was &s;o di&s;gu&s;ted at the Conduct of the governing Bi&s;hops there, he cen&s;ured them with &s;o much Warmth, and was, at the &s;ame time, &s;o remarkable for his &s;trict and exemplary Life, that he was generally called a <HI>Puritan:</HI> But when he &s;aw, that in&s;tead of reforming Abu&s;es in the Epi&s;copal Order, the Order it&s;elf was &s;truck at, he adhered to it with great Zeal and Con&s;tancy; as he did to the Rights of the Crown, without once complying with that Party, which afterwards prevailed in both Nations. For tho' he agreed with <HI>Barclay</HI> and <HI>Grotius</HI> (with the latter of whom he had been intimately acquainted) as to their Notions of Re|&s;i&s;tance, where the Laws are broke through by a limited Sove|reign; yet he did not think that was then the Ca&s;e in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>Our Author's Mother was very eminent for her Piety and Virtue; &s;he was a warm Zealot for the Presbyterian Di&s;cipline; her Education that way had been very &s;trict; &s;he was Si&s;ter to the famous Sir <HI>Archibald John&s;toun,</HI> called Lord <HI>Warri&s;toun,</HI>
<PB N="673" REF="701">
who, during the Civil Wars, was at the Head of the Presbyte|rians; and was too often hurried away, by his Attachment to them, into Exce&s;&s;es that were not &s;uitable to his natural Temper; which was ju&s;t, generous and &s;elf-denying: In&s;omuch that he left behind him but a very &s;mall Provi&s;ion, for a Family of thirteen Children, though for many Years he had been entru&s;ted with the whole Government of <HI>Scotland.</HI> He was &s;o zealous in the Intere&s;ts of his Party, that neither Friend&s;hip nor Alliance could di&s;po&s;e him, to &s;hew favour to tho&s;e, who refu&s;ed the &s;o|lemn League and Covenant. Our Author's Father therefore, per|&s;i&s;ting in this Refu&s;al, at three &s;everal times was obliged to quit the Kingdom, and at one of them to remain an Exile for five Years: And, when his Return was afterwards connived at, as his Princi|ples would not permit him to renew the Practice of the Law, much le&s;s to accept of the Preferments in it, offered him by <HI>Oliver Cromwell,</HI> he lived retired in the Country upon his own E&s;tate, till the Re&s;toration; when he was made one of the Lords of the Se&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>His Father's Retirement from Bu&s;ine&s;s proved a con&s;iderable <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Educa|tion.</NOTE> Advantage to our Author's Education, which was wholly under his Care, and &s;o managed by him, that at ten Years old his Son was Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue: he was &s;ent at that Age to the College of <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> where he perfected him&s;elf in <HI>Greek,</HI> and went through the common Methods of the <HI>Ari&s;totalian</HI> Logick and Philo&s;ophy with Applau&s;e; he commenced Ma&s;ter of Arts before he was fourteen, and then applied him&s;elf to the Law, much to the regret of his Father, who had always de&s;igned him for a Clergyman. He continued &s;tudying the <HI>Civil</HI> and <HI>Feudal</HI> Law for above a Year, by which he laid in &s;uch true Notions of Society and Government, as are &s;eldom found among&s;t Divines; he then changed his Re&s;olution, and determined wholly to dedicate him&s;elf to the Church: Thereupon he pur&s;ued a very hard Cour&s;e of Study; he went through the old and new Te&s;tament, with all the &s;everal Commentaries upon the different Parts of it, then in repute; he examined into the mo&s;t noted Authors in Controver&s;y, and read <HI>Bellarmine</HI> and <HI>Chamier,</HI> in oppo&s;ition to each other, quite through; he peru&s;ed &s;ome of the mo&s;t received Sy&s;tems of School-Divinity, but was &s;oon di&s;gu&s;ted at the Subtlety of tho&s;e Writers, and readily ob&s;erved, how little all their Di&s;putes, which the Jargon of the Schools rendred endle&s;s, could tend towards making Men wi&s;er or better. In his Hours of Amu&s;ement, he ran through many Volumes of Hi&s;tory: And it is &s;carce con|ceivable, what a Progre&s;s he had made in the&s;e Studies, before he
<PB N="674" REF="702">
was eighteen, by an Application, which &s;eldom fell &s;hort of four|teen Hours in a Day.</P>
<P>At that Age, he was put upon his Trial, as a Probationer <NOTE PLACE="marg">He is ad|mitted as a Probationer.</NOTE> or Expectant Preacher; who, after having pa&s;s'd Examina|tion, is at liberty to preach where&s;oever he is de&s;ired, but has no particular Church, to which he is attendant. This is the fir&s;t Step in <HI>Scotland,</HI> towards an Admi&s;&s;ion into Orders, and was practi&s;ed both under the Epi&s;copal and Presbyterian Oeconomy. The Method ob&s;erved in it has &s;omething &s;o different from what is cu&s;tomary in <HI>England,</HI> that it may perhaps be worthy the Reader's Notice. The&s;e Probationers are fir&s;t appointed to preach practically on a Text a&s;&s;igned them; next, critically upon another, the Sen&s;e of which is controverted; and then a mix'd Sermon, of Critici&s;m on the Text, and practical Inferences from it, is expected from them. After this, the Examiners allot a Head of Divinity to each, on which they are to make a <HI>Latin</HI> Oration, and to give out <HI>The&s;es</HI> upon it, which they undertake to defend in publick: Then a <HI>Hebrew</HI> P&s;alm and a Portion of the <HI>Greek</HI> Te&s;|tament is given them, to render into <HI>Engli&s;h extempore;</HI> and la&s;t of all comes the Que&s;tionary Trial, in which every Mini&s;ter of the Di&s;trict is at liberty to put &s;uch Que&s;tions to the Per&s;on under Examination, as occur to him, out of the Scripture or Body of Divinity. Before any one can be admitted to this, he mu&s;t pro|duce a Te&s;timonial of his good Life from the Mini&s;ter of the Pari&s;h where he lives; and if during his Trial, which la&s;ts for three Months, any Scandal can be proved upon him, he is laid a&s;ide as unfit for the Church.</P>
<P>This Probation our Author went through, at the Age of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Refu&s;es a Pre&s;entation to a Living.</NOTE> Eighteen; about which time his Father was made a <HI>Lord</HI> of the <HI>Se&s;&s;ion,</HI> and his Cou&s;in German, Sir <HI>Alexander Burnet,</HI> gave him the Pre&s;entation to a very good Benefice, where his Family re|&s;ided, and which lay in the Center of all his Kindred. There is no Law in <HI>Scotland,</HI> that limits the Age a Mini&s;ter mu&s;t be of; but our Author thought his own &s;o unfit for a Cure of Souls, that he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to accept of it, notwith&s;tanding the repeated Importunities of all his Relations, except his Father, who left him wholly to his own Di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>In the Year 1661, his Father died; and &s;oon after his Bro|ther <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Father's Death, and his further Pur&s;uit of his Studies.</NOTE> <HI>Robert,</HI> who was then become very eminent at the Bar, as his other Brother <HI>Thomas</HI> was afterwards in Phy&s;ick: Upon the occa&s;ion of his Brother's Death, our Author was much &s;ollicited, by his Mother's Relations, to return to his former Study of the Law, wherein he was a&s;&s;ured of the greate&s;t Encouragement; but he per&s;i&s;ted in his former Re&s;olution, of devoting his Life
<PB N="675" REF="703">
to the Service of the Church, in which he was confirmed by Mr. <HI>Nairn,</HI> Mini&s;ter of the Abbey Church at <HI>Edinburgh.</HI> Mr. <HI>Nairn</HI> was then the admired Preacher of that Country, remark|able for Accuracy of Style, as well as Strength of Rea&s;oning and Sublimene&s;s of Thought: Him our Author purpo&s;ed to make his Pattern, in this Branch of the Pa&s;toral Office; and was not a little &s;urprized to find, that he always preached <HI>extempore.</HI> For though all Sermons in <HI>Scotland</HI> were delivered without book, yet were they premeditated Di&s;cour&s;es, fir&s;t written and then learn'd by heart; which was a lo&s;s of time Mr. <HI>Nairn</HI> could not &s;ubmit to, and he &s;oon put our Author upon attempting the &s;ame Me|thod of Preaching, which he continued to practi&s;e all the re&s;t of his Life <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I &s;hall only mention two remarkable In|&s;tances in relation to his preaching without Book. In 1691, when the Sees, vacant by the Depriva|tion of the Nonjuring Bi&s;hops, were filled up, Bi&s;hop <HI>Williams</HI> was appointed to preach one of the Con&s;ecration Sermons at <HI>Row-</HI>Church. But being detained by &s;ome Accident, the Clerk had twice &s;et the P&s;alm, and &s;till the Preacher did not appear. Whereupon the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canter|bury</HI> de&s;ired Dr. <HI>Burnet,</HI> then Bi&s;hop of <HI>Sarum,</HI> to &s;upply his Place, which he did; and, as the Archbi&s;hop declared, gave them the be&s;t Sermon he ever heard him preach. In 1705, he was ap|pointed to preach the Thank&s;giving Sermon be|fore the Queen at <HI>St. Paul's;</HI> and as it was the only Di&s;cour&s;e he had ever wrote beforehand, to this was the only time that he was ever at a pau&s;e in Preaching, which on that occa&s;ion la&s;ted for a|bove a Minute. The&s;e two Incidents were &s;o publickly known and &s;poke of, that I think it needle&s;s to alledge any particular Authority for them, unle&s;s they &s;hould be que&s;tioned.</NOTE>. He attained to an Ea&s;ine&s;s in it, chiefly by allotting many Hours of the Day to Meditation upon all &s;orts of Subjects, and by accu&s;toming him&s;elf, at tho&s;e times, to &s;peak his Thoughts aloud, &s;tudying always to render his Expre&s;&s;ion correct. Mr. <HI>Nairn</HI> led him likewi&s;e into a new Cour&s;e of Reading, by recommend|ing to his Peru&s;al <HI>Smith's Select Di&s;cour&s;es,</HI> Dr. <HI>More's Works,</HI> and the Writings of <HI>Plato</HI> and his Followers; but no Book plea&s;ed him more than <HI>Hooker's Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Polity,</HI> from the Principles of which he never departed.</P>
<P>In the Year 1662, the <HI>Scotch</HI> Bi&s;hops, who had been con&s;e|crated at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> made a pompous Entry into <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and, by the Pride of their fir&s;t Appearance, gave no good Omen of their future Conduct. Bi&s;hop <HI>Leightoun,</HI> though one of their number, would have no &s;hare in the State they took upon them, on this occa&s;ion: He &s;oon became acquainted with our Author's growing Fame, and as he conceived a great Affection for him, he took a peculiar Plea&s;ure in overlooking his Studies. By his Advice, he became conver&s;ant with all the Primitive Writers, going through the Apologys and other Treati&s;es of the Fathers of the three fir&s;t Centuries, and <HI>Binnius's</HI> Collection of Councils, down to the &s;econd Council of <HI>Nice.</HI></P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, our Author contracted an Intimacy with another eminent Divine, Mr. <HI>Charteris,</HI> a Man of great Pru|dence, joined to an unaffected Simplicity of Behaviour: He was not only very knowing in his own Profe&s;&s;ion, but was likewi&s;e a
<PB N="676" REF="704">
great Ma&s;ter of Hi&s;tory, both antient and modern, of Geography and Books of Travels, and not a little skilled in Mathematical Learning. The&s;e three Per&s;ons, by their Conver&s;ation and Ad|vice, contributed towards fini&s;hing an Education, which had been &s;o happily begun. And indeed, what might not be ex|pected from &s;uch early Helps, where Nature had laid in Mate|rials, &s;o fit to be wrought upon? For there was a robu&s;t Con&s;ti|tution, capable of the harde&s;t Labour and Study, an Apprehen|&s;ion that took things quickly, and a Memory that retained them long, an Imagination rather too lively, and a natural Fluency of Expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In the Year 1663, our Author took a &s;hort Tour into <HI>Eng|land:</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Journey to <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> He fir&s;t vi&s;ited the two Univer&s;ities; at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> he had an Opportunity to know and admire the exten&s;ive Learning of Dr. <HI>Cudworth,</HI> the Judgment and Moderation of Dr. <HI>Pear&s;on,</HI> the fine luxuriant Imagination of Dr. <HI>Burnet</HI> (Author of the Theory) and the Free-Thinking of Dr. <HI>Henry More,</HI> one of who&s;e Sayings, with relation to Rites and Ceremonies, then made great Impre&s;&s;ion on him; <HI>None of the&s;e,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>are bad enough to make Men bad, and I am &s;ure none of them are good enough to make Men good.</HI> At <HI>Oxford</HI> our Author was much ca|re&s;s'd, on account of his ready Knowledge of the Councils and Fathers, e&s;pecially by Dr. <HI>Fell,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Pocock,</HI> that great Ma&s;ter of Oriental Learning; he was much improved there in his Ma|thematicks and Philo&s;ophy by the In&s;tructions of Dr. <HI>Wallis,</HI> who likewi&s;e gave him a Letter of Recommendation to the Learned and Pious Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI> at <HI>London.</HI> Upon his Arrival there, he was introduced to all the mo&s;t noted Divines, &s;uch as <HI>Tillot&s;on, Stil|lingfleet, Patrick, Lloyd, Whitchcot</HI> and <HI>Wilkins,</HI> who&s;e Cha|racters are faithfully drawn by him in the Hi&s;tory. But no Con|ver&s;ation proved a greater Advantage to him, than that of Sir <HI>Ro|bert Murray,</HI> not only as he brought him into the be&s;t Company, but as he al&s;o acted the part of a faithful Monitor, in reprov|ing him for any Errors or Indi&s;cretions, his Youth might be|tray him into. After a Stay in <HI>England</HI> of about &s;ix Months, which, being &s;pent in the manner I have mentioned, could not but be highly u&s;eful, he returned to <HI>Scotland,</HI> where he was again pre&s;s'd to enter into Orders, and accept of one of the be&s;t Benefices in the We&s;t.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Robert Fletcher</HI> of <HI>Saltoun,</HI> who, during his &s;tay at <HI>Paris,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Delays ac|cepting a good Bene|fice.</NOTE> had received many Obligations from his Father, hearing &s;o great a Character of the Son, invited him down to his Seat, and had no &s;ooner heard him preach, than he offered him that Church, the Mini&s;ter of it being nominated to one of the Vacant Bi&s;hopricks.
<PB N="677" REF="705">
Our Author would have execu&s;ed him&s;elf, as having determined for &s;ome Months to travel beyond Sea; and &s;olicited the Living for his Friend Mr. <HI>Nairn:</HI> but Sir <HI>Robert</HI> would admit of no de|nial; and as the pre&s;ent Incumbent was not to be con&s;ecrated immediately, re&s;olved to keep the Benefice vacant, till his return from his Travels.</P>
<P>It was in the Year 1664, that our Author went over to <HI>Hol|land;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Travels into <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>France.</HI></NOTE> where, after he had &s;een what was remarkable in the &s;even Provinces, he fixed his Re&s;idence at <HI>Am&s;terdam.</HI> There, by the help of a learned <HI>Rabbi,</HI> he prefected him&s;elf in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Language; he likewi&s;e became acquainted with the leading Men of the different Per&s;ua&s;ions tolerated in that Country; as the <HI>Arminians;</HI> the <HI>Luthe|rans,</HI> the <HI>Unitarians,</HI> the <HI>Browni&s;ts,</HI> the <HI>Anabapti&s;ts,</HI> and the <HI>Pa|pi&s;ts:</HI> Among&s;t each of whom, he u&s;ed frequently to declare he had met with Men of &s;uch r&egrave;al Piety and Virtue, that there he became fix'd in that &s;trong Principle of univer&s;al Charity, and of thinking well of tho&s;e that differed from him, as likewi&s;e in an invincible Abhorrence of all Severities, on account of religious Di&s;&s;en&s;ions, which hath often drawn upon him the bittere&s;t Cen&s;ures from tho&s;e, who, perhaps by a narrower Education, were led into a narrower way of Thinking.</P>
<P>From <HI>Holland</HI> he pa&s;t through the <HI>Netherlands</HI> into <HI>France;</HI> he remained for &s;ome time at <HI>Paris,</HI> and conver&s;ed often with the two famous Mini&s;ters of <HI>Charenton, Daill&egrave;</HI> and <HI>Morus;</HI> the one re|nowned for his Learning and Judgment, the other for his bright Parts and Eloquence. He through there entred too much of the Ge&s;ture of the Theatre into <HI>Morus</HI>'s delivery; his Sermons were full of Fire and of Turns, which being out of the common Road, at once &s;urpri&s;ed and plea&s;ed his Audience; but when the&s;e Flights, which pa&s;t currently in a pathetick Di&s;cour&s;e, came to be coolly con&s;idered, they would hardly bear the Te&s;t: So that as our Au|thor found in him much that de&s;erved Imitation, there was &s;till more that required Correction. His Stay in <HI>France</HI> was the longer, on account of the great Freedom and Kindne&s;s, with which he was treated by the Lord <HI>Holles,</HI> then Amba&s;&s;ador at the <HI>French</HI> Court. Towards the End of the Year he returned to <HI>Scotland</HI> through <HI>London,</HI> where he was introduced, by the Pre&s;ident Sir <HI>Robert Murray,</HI> to be a Member of the Royal So|ciety.</P>
<P>Soon after his Arrival at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> Sir <HI>Robert Fletcher</HI> came <NOTE PLACE="marg">$para$</NOTE> thither, and carried him down to <HI>Saltoun,</HI> giving him the Pre|&s;entation to that Church; but he declined taking it ab&s;olutely at fir&s;t, and re&s;olved to continue there four Months, performing all the Functions of a Mini&s;ter, without engaging him&s;elf to the Pari&s;h, till
<PB N="678" REF="706">
he &s;hould have the joint Reque&s;t of all the Pari&s;hioners; which he afterwards had, without one &s;ingle Exception: and thereupon he was ordained a Prie&s;t by the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> in the Year 1665. During the five Years he remained at <HI>Saltoun,</HI> he preached twice every Sunday, and once more on one of the Week Days; he catechi&s;ed three times a Week, &s;o as to examine every Pa|ri&s;hioner, old or young, thrice over in the compa&s;s of a Year; he went round his Pari&s;h, from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e, in&s;tructing, re|proving or comforting them, as Occa&s;ion required; tho&s;e that were &s;ick, he vi&s;ited twice a day; he admini&s;tred the Sacrament four times a Year, and per&s;onally in&s;tructed all &s;uch, as gave No|tice they intended to receive it; all that remained above his own nece&s;&s;ary Sub&s;i&s;tence (in which he was very frugal) he gave away in Charity.

Thus as he knew the Concerns of his&endq;</Q> whole Pari&s;h, as he treated them with Tenderne&s;s and Care, and as he &s;et them a fair Example of every Article of that Duty, which he taught them, he had &s;oon gained the Affections of them all, not excepting the Presbyterians; though he was then the only Man in <HI>Scotland,</HI> that made u&s;e of the Prayers in the Liturgy of the Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>As his Studies were chiefly bent upon the Pa&s;toral Care, in which he endeavoured to in&s;truct him&s;elf from the be&s;t Writers, concerning the Con&s;titution of the Primitive Church, during the three fir&s;t Centuries, among whom St. <HI>Cyprian</HI> was the chief; he ob&s;erved, that the Bi&s;hops, who governed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> though they derived the &s;tronge&s;t Arguments for their Order, from the&s;e very Books, yet neglected all the Rules pre&s;cribed in them. He therefore drew up a Memorial of their Abu&s;es, of which &s;ome Relation is given in the Hi&s;tory, as likewi&s;e of the har&s;h Treat|ment he met with, upon that Occa&s;ion. However, as this Step had made &s;ome noi&s;e, and might be imputed to Ambition, or a De|&s;ire of becoming popular; he re&s;olved to live in a more retired
<PB N="679" REF="707">
manner, than he had done hitherto; and ab&s;tracting him&s;elf from all mixt Company, confining him&s;elf wholly to Study and the Duties of his Function, he entred into &s;uch an A&s;cetick Cour&s;e, as had well nigh put an end to his Life: for his bad Diet, joined to hard Study, had &s;o corrupted the Ma&s;s of his Blood, that in two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Fevers he was given over by the Phy&s;icians.</P>
<P>In the Year 1668, as the Government of <HI>Scotland,</HI> both in <NOTE PLACE="marg">Much con|&s;ulted by the Mini&s;try in <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> Church and State, was put into the hands of moderate Men, a|mong whom Sir <HI>Robert Murray</HI> was a principal Leader, our Au|thor was frequently &s;ent for and con&s;ulted by them; he was after|wards employed, as one of the chief Managers for the Church, in negociating the Scheme of an Accommodation, between the Epi&s;co|pal and Presbyterian Parties; of which a full Account is given in the Hi&s;tory. He was, upon that Occa&s;ion, introduced to the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Hamilton;</HI> who, though her Inclinations lay toward Presby|tery, profe&s;&s;ed her &s;elf a Friend to moderate Coun&s;els. By her he was invited, the Year following, to <HI>Hamilton,</HI> where he con|tracted an Acquaintance with the Regent of the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Gla&s;gow;</HI> who conceived &s;uch an E&s;teem for him, that, their Chair of Divinity being vacant, he propo&s;ed our Author, as the Per&s;on mo&s;t proper to fill it; and he recommended this in &s;o ef|fectual a manner, that in a few Days after, he brought over to <HI>Hamilton,</HI> the Decree of the Univer&s;ity, electing him their Pro|fe&s;&s;or. As this Matter had been wholly tran&s;acted without his <NOTE PLACE="marg">Is made Pro|fe&s;&s;or of Di|vinity at <HI>Gla&s;gow.</HI></NOTE> knowledge, &s;o was he, for &s;ome time, in &s;u&s;pen&s;e what Re&s;olu|tion to take; his Friends were all earne&s;t in per&s;uading him to ac|cept of it, his Pari&s;hioners at <HI>Saltoun,</HI> for whom he had a mo&s;t tender regard, were no le&s;s anxious to retain him: At length the Authority of Archbi&s;hop <HI>Leightoun</HI> prevailed, and he removed to <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> in the Year 1669, where he continued four years and a half, in no &s;mall Exerci&s;e of his Patience. The Presbyterian Zea|lots hated him, as apprehending that his Schemes of Moderation would, in the end, prove the &s;ure Way of e&s;tabli&s;hing Epi&s;copacy among&s;t them: The Epi&s;copal Party, on the other hand, could not endure a Man, who was for exempting the Di&s;&s;enters from their Pro&s;ecutions.</P>
<P>As his principal Care, in this new Station, was to form ju&s;t <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Con|$span$ $word$ that Station.</NOTE> and true Notions in the Students of Divinity; he laid down a Plan for that purpo&s;e, to which no other Objection could be of|fered, but that it &s;eemed to require the Labour of four or five, in&s;tead of one Man; yet he never failed executing every part of it, during his Re&s;idence at <HI>Gla&s;gow.</HI> On Mondays he made each of the Students, in his turn, explain a Head of Divi|nity in <HI>Latin,</HI> and propound &s;uch <HI>The&s;es</HI> from it, as he was to

defend again&s;t the re&s;t of the Scholars; and this Exerci&s;e con|cluded with our Author's deci&s;ion of the Point, in a <HI>Latin</HI> Ora|tion. On Tue&s;days he gave them a <HI>Prelection</HI> in the &s;ame Language, wherein he purpo&s;ed, in the cour&s;e of eight Years, to have gone through a compleat Sy&s;tem of Divinity. On Wed|ne&s;days, he read them a Lecture, for above an hour, by way of a critical Commentary on St. <HI>Mathew</HI>'s Go&s;pel, which he fini&s;hed before he quitted the Chair. On Thur&s;days the Exerci&s;e was al|ternate; one Thur&s;day he expounded a <HI>Hebrew</HI> P&s;alm, compa|ring it with the <HI>Septuagint,</HI> the <HI>Vulgar</HI> and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ver&s;ion; and the next Thur&s;day, he explained &s;ome Portion of the Ritual and Con&s;titution of the Primitive Church, making the Apo&s;toli|cal Canons his Text, and reducing every Article of Practice, under the Head of one or other of tho&s;e Canons. On Fridays he made each of his Scholars, in cour&s;e, preach a &s;hort Sermon, upon &s;ome Text he a&s;&s;igned; and when it was ended, he ob|&s;erved upon any thing, that was defective or ami&s;s, &s;hewing how the Text ought to have been opened and applied. This was the Labour of the Mornings; in the Evenings, after Prayer, he every day read them &s;ome Parcel of Scripture, on which he made a &s;hort Di&s;cour&s;e, and when that was over, he examined into the Progre&s;s of their &s;everal Studies, incouraging them to propo&s;e their difficulties to him, upon the Subjects they were then read|ing. This he performed, during the whole time the Schools were open; thereby an&s;wering the Duty of a Profe&s;&s;or, with the A&s;&s;iduity of a School-Ma&s;ter: and in order to acquit him&s;elf with Credit, he was obliged to &s;tudy hard from Four till Ten in the Morning; the re&s;t of the Day being of nece&s;&s;ity allotted, either to the U&s;e of his Pupils, or to hearing the Complaints of the Clergy; who, finding he had an Intere&s;t with the Men in Power, were not &s;paring in their Applications to him.</P>
<P>In times of Vacation, our Author made frequent Vi&s;its to <HI>Ha|milton;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">He under|takes $word$ $word$ the <HI>$span$ of $he Dukes of</HI> Hamilton.</NOTE> and was ea&s;ily engaged by the Dutche&s;s, to undertake the Task, of examining and putting in order all the Papers, that re|lated to her Father's and her Uncle's Mini&s;try; &s;he had kept the&s;e carefully together, but had not hitherto found a Per&s;on, whom &s;he thought &s;afe to be entru&s;ted with the Peru&s;al of them; yet now &s;he had &s;o entire a Confidence in him, that &s;he put them all into his hands. The Earl (afterwards Duke) of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> no &s;ooner heard that he was compiling <HI>Memoirs of the Dukes of Ha|milton,</HI> than he wrote to <HI>Scotland,</HI> earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ing him to come up to Court, in order to receive &s;uch Informations from him&s;elf, concerning the Tran&s;actions of tho&s;e Times, as he was able to furni&s;h. Our Author thereupon went to <HI>London,</HI> where he was

received, by the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> with &s;uch Marks of Con|fidence, as made it evident, that had he pur&s;ued the common Methods of cultivating an Intere&s;t, he might have rai&s;ed him|&s;elf to a great Fortune: But as he was a con&s;tant Enemy to all tho&s;e Artifices of a Court, whereby Men u&s;ually ri&s;e, &s;o was he naturally of too frank a Spirit, to bear with the Earl's imperious Temper. All the u&s;e therefore he made, of his Freedom of Acce&s;s, was in negotiating and concluding a Reconciliation, be|tween him and Duke <HI>Hamilton;</HI> who had A&s;&s;ignations given him, on the Revenues of the Crown, in &s;atisfaction of tho&s;e Preten&s;ions, of which our Author had found authentick Vouchers, among the Papers entru&s;ted to his Care; and the Duke, in return, promi&s;ed to concur with the Mea&s;ures of the Court, in the en&s;uing Parliament. Four Bi&s;hopricks in <HI>Scotland</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">He refu&s;es a Bi&s;hoprick in <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> becoming vacant at this time, our Author was offered his Choice of them; but he declined accepting a Station, for which he thought his Years were unfit, in which he fore&s;aw, he &s;hould be much entangled, and in all probability would be capable of do|ing little Good.</P>
<P>Soon after his Return to <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> he married the Lady <HI>Mar|garet</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Mar|riage with the Lady <HI>Mar|garet Ken|nedy.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Kennedy,</HI> a Daughter of the Earl of <HI>Ca&s;&s;iles,</HI> who lived in great Intimacy and Friend&s;hip with the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Hamilton:</HI> She was a Lady of di&s;tingui&s;hed Piety and Knowledge; her own Sentiments inclined &s;trongly towards the Presbyterians, with whom &s;he was in high Credit and E&s;teem; yet was &s;he far from entering into the rigid and narrow Zeal of &s;ome of their Leaders. As there was &s;ome Di&s;parity in their Ages, that it might remain with|out di&s;pute, that this Match was wholly owing to Inclination, not to Avarice or Ambition; the Day before their Marriage, our Au|thor delivered the Lady a Deed, whereby he renounced all Pre|ten&s;ion to her Fortune, which was very con&s;iderable, and mu&s;t otherwi&s;e have fallen into his hands, &s;he her&s;elf having no In|tention to &s;ecure it.</P>
<P>In the Year 1672, Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> was &s;ent down, as the King's Commi&s;&s;ioner, to hold a Parliament in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and our Au|thor was con&s;idered as the Per&s;on, who had the greate&s;t Influence over him; which was wholly employed in doing good Offices to needy Suitors, and in preventing a Breach, between him and Duke <HI>Hamilton;</HI> for which he was much exclaimed at, by the Party, then oppo&s;ing the Court, who could have no hopes of prevailing, unle&s;s the latter would put him&s;elf at their head. About this time, he publi&s;hed his <HI>Vindication of the Au|thority, Con&s;titution, and Laws of the Church and State of</HI> Scot|land; wherein he &s;trongly maintained the Cau&s;e of Epi&s;copacy,
<PB N="682" REF="710">
and the Illegality of Re&s;i&s;tance, merely on account of Religion. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Again re|fu&s;es a Bi|&s;hoprick, with the Promi&s;e of the next Archbi|&s;hoprick.</NOTE> This was thought, in that juncture, &s;uch a publick Service, that he was again courted to accept of a Bi&s;hoprick, with the Promi&s;e of the next Archbi&s;hoprick, that &s;hould be void; but he &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in his Refu&s;al.</P>
<P>In 1673, he was obliged to take another Journey to <HI>London,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Favour at Court.</NOTE> in order to obtain a Licence, for publi&s;hing his <HI>Memoirs of the Dukes of</HI> Hamilton; he went likewi&s;e with a full de&s;ign, to break off from farther meddling in Matters of State; he &s;aw that Popery was at bottom the prevailing Intere&s;t at Court, and that the Sacramental Te&s;t, whereby the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> the Lord <HI>Clifford</HI> and other Papi&s;ts in Employment had been excluded, was a meer Artifice of King <HI>Charles,</HI> to obtain Money for car|rying on the War that Summer with <HI>Holland.</HI> He &s;u&s;pected that the De&s;igns of the Court were both corrupt and de&s;perate; he therefore u&s;ed all the Freedom, he decently could, with the Duke and Dutche&s;s of <HI>Lauderdale;</HI> he pointed out to them the Errors of their Management in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the ill Effects it would have, both upon them&s;elves, and upon the whole Na|tion; and when he &s;aw no di&s;po&s;ition to rectify their Mea&s;ures, he rejected all Offers of Preferment made to him&s;elf; though he could not decline being &s;worn one of the King's Chaplains, which, as it was a Po&s;t of no profit, &s;o was it confer'd upon him at his Maje&s;ty's expre&s;s Nomination, upon having heard him preach. As Duke <HI>Lau|derdale</HI>'s Enemies were &s;oon informed of the Frankne&s;s, with which he had remon&s;trated to his Grace, again&s;t the Methods of Ad|mini&s;tration, he was then pur&s;uing; and as they knew his Friend&s;hip and Attachment to the <HI>Hamilton</HI> Family, they in|du&s;triou&s;ly magnified his Credit in <HI>Scotland,</HI> to &s;uch a degree, that his Maje&s;ty often &s;ent for him in private, and the Duke of <HI>York</HI> much oftener. He made no other u&s;e of the high Favour, &s;hewn him by the latter, than fir&s;t to introduce Dr. <HI>Stilling fleet</HI> to him; and afterwards to propo&s;e a Conference, to be held in his Royal Highne&s;s's pre&s;ence, between them two and the chief of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Prie&s;ts: though there was little Rea&s;on at that time to hope, that any Arguments would be able to effect the Duke's Conver&s;ion, and the very Propo&s;al of &s;uch a Di&s;pute, was in a great mea&s;ure renouncing all Preten&s;ions to Preferment. He likewi&s;e &s;ought no other Advantage, from the great Freedom with which the King received him, than only to awaken in that Prince a Sen&s;e of Religion, and to rou&s;e him from that Lethargy of Vice and Indolence, in which his natural great Talents &s;eemed wholly buried. This is &s;o much the rever&s;e of the Conduct of a&s;piring Clergymen, it lies &s;o directly out of the road to Power,

Riches, or Dignity, that I hope it may acquit him from all Imputation of Ambition.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the <HI>Memoirs of the Dukes of Hamilton</HI> were li|cen&s;ed <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Breach with Duke <HI>Lauderdale.</HI></NOTE> by Mr. Secretary <HI>Coventry;</HI> which was the longer de|layed, becau&s;e the King and many of the Mini&s;ters were de&s;irous to read them in Manu&s;cript; our Author returned to <HI>Scotland:</HI> And on his Arrival at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> finding the Animo&s;ity, be|tween the Dukes of <HI>Hamilton</HI> and <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> ri&s;en to a height not to be compo&s;ed, he retired to his Station at <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> and re|fu&s;ed to &s;tir from thence all that Winter. This, joined to the Jealou&s;y, the Favour &s;hewn him at <HI>London</HI> had rai&s;ed, drew upon him a Storm, which pur&s;ued him for many Years after, with the utmo&s;t Violence. The Mea&s;ures of the Court proving un&s;ucce&s;sful in Parliament, Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> threw the Load of his own Mi&s;carriage upon our Author, whom he repre&s;ented as the Cau&s;e and In&s;trument, under hand, of all the Oppo&s;i|tion he had met with. This Accu&s;ation made it incumbent on him, once more to return to Court in the Year 1674. The King received him coldly, and ordered his Name to be &s;truck out of the Li&s;t of Chaplains; yet, at the Duke of <HI>York</HI>'s Intreaty, he admitted him to offer, what he thought proper in his own Ju&s;tification: He thereupon gave his Maje&s;ty &s;o clear and &s;atis|factory an Account of his Conduct, appealing for the Truth of all his A&s;&s;ertions to Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> that in the end the King &s;eemed convinced of his Innocence, and ordered him home to <HI>Gla&s;gow.</HI> But the Duke of <HI>York</HI> di&s;&s;uaded him from returning thither, 'till his Peace &s;hould be entirely made; for he a&s;&s;ured him, that otherwi&s;e he would be clap'd up in Pri&s;on, and de|tained there perhaps as long as the &s;ame Intere&s;t prevailed at Court; his Royal Highne&s;s likewi&s;e u&s;ed his utmo&s;t Endeavours to have reconciled him with Duke <HI>Lauderdale;</HI> but that he found impracticable: the latter in&s;i&s;ting, that our Author &s;hould abandon his be&s;t Friends, and di&s;cover all the Secrets, he had hitherto been in; and the other, as firmly per&s;i&s;ting in his Ad|herence to tho&s;e, who had &s;hewn him Friend&s;hip, or repo&s;ed a Confidence in him.</P>
<P>Thus it became nece&s;&s;ary either, by going back to <HI>Scotland,</HI> to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Is forced to quit his Pro|fe&s;&s;or&s;hip at <HI>Gla&s;gow.</HI></NOTE> put him&s;elf in the power of Enemies, who were not likely to treat him with any regard to Ju&s;tice or his own Innocence, or el&s;e to re&s;ign his Profe&s;&s;or's Chair, and &s;ettle in <HI>England.</HI> He cho&s;e the latter, if it may be called a Choice; and &s;ought an E&s;tabli&s;hment in <HI>London:</HI> in which he met with all the oppo&s;i|tion, the Mini&s;try could give him; particularly in one Church (as he him&s;elf relates it in the Hi&s;tory) where the Electors were

Though the being thus in a manner turn'd a-drift, could not at the time but &s;eem a Misfortune, yet he ever &s;poke of it as the happie&s;t Event of his Life. He was but thirty Years old, and though the Charms of Ambition had not that Influence over him, which is u&s;ual at tho&s;e Years; yet he thought it a &s;ignal Ble&s;&s;ing, that any Acci|dent had di&s;entangled him, from the Snares of &s;o corrupt a Court, in who&s;e Service he had been &s;o far engaged, that he could not otherwi&s;e have been ea&s;ily delivered from them.</P>

After this, in the Year 1675, he was recom|mended by the Lord <HI>Holles</HI> to the Friend&s;hip of Sir <HI>Harbottle Grim&s;ton,</HI> Ma&s;ter of the Rolls, by whom he was appointed Preacher to the Chappel there: and though the Court &s;ent fir&s;t a Bi&s;hop, and then Mr. Secretary <HI>William&s;on,</HI> to per&s;uade Sir <HI>Harbottle</HI> to di&s;mi&s;s him, as one highly unacceptable to the King, yet he per&s;i&s;ted in the Nomination he had made.

Accordingly, in le&s;s than two Years after, he printed the Second Volume, which met with the &s;ame general Approbation, as the Fir&s;t: and &s;uch was his readine&s;s in compo&s;ing, that he wrote the Hi&s;torical Part, in the compa&s;s of Six Weeks, after all his Materials were laid in order.</P>

<P><Q>&startq;I Have not pre&s;umed to trouble Your Maje&s;ty for &s;ome <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Letter to the King.</NOTE> Months, not having any thing worthy your Time to offer; and now I choo&s;e rather this way, &s;ince the infinite Duty I owe you puts me under Re&s;traints in Di&s;cour&s;e, which I can|not &s;o ea&s;ily overcome. What I &s;hall now &s;ugge&s;t to your Maje&s;ty, I do it as in the pre&s;ence of Almighty God, to whom I know I mu&s;t give an Account of all my Actions: I therefore beg you will be graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to accept this mo&s;t faithful Zeal of your poor Subject, who has no other De&s;ign in it, than your Good, and the Di&s;charge of his own Con&s;cience.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;I mu&s;t then fir&s;t a&s;&s;ure Your Maje&s;ty, I never di&s;covered any thing like a De&s;ign of rai&s;ing Rebellion, among all tho&s;e with whom I conver&s;e; but I &s;hall add, on the other hand, that mo&s;t People grow fullen, and are highly di&s;&s;atisfied with You, and di&s;tru&s;tful of You. Formerly Your Mini&s;ters, or his Royal Highne&s;s, bore the blame of things that were ungrateful; but now it falls upon Your&s;elf, and Time, which cures mo&s;t other Di&s;tempers, encrea&s;es this. Your la&s;t Speech makes ma|ny think, it will be ea&s;y to &s;etch up Petitions from all Parts of <HI>England:</HI> This is now under Con&s;ultation, and is not yet determined; but I find &s;o many inclined to promote them, that as far as I can judge, it will go that way. If Your Ma|je&s;ty calls a new Parliament, it is believed, that tho&s;e who have promoted the Petitions will be generally elected; for the in|feriour &s;o$t of People are much &s;$t upon them, and make their Judgment of Men, from their Behaviour in that Matter. The $obe$er &s;o$t of tho&s;e, who are ill plea&s;ed at Your Conduct, reckon that either the State of Your Affairs beyond Sea, or of Your $x$heq$$r at home, will $word$ long nece&s;&s;itate Your meeting Your Parliament; and that then things mu&s;t be rectified: and therefore they u&s;e their utmo&s;t Endeavours to keep all quiet. If Your Maje&s;ty has a Se&s;&s;ion in <HI>April,</HI> for &s;upporting Your
<PB N="687" REF="715">
Allies, I find it is re&s;olved by many, That the Money nece&s;&s;ary to maintain Your Alliances, &s;hall be put into the hands of Commi&s;&s;ioners, to i&s;&s;ue it as they &s;hall an&s;wer to the two Hou&s;es: and the&s;e will be &s;o cho&s;en, that as it is likely, that the Per&s;ons will be very unacceptable to You, &s;o they being tru&s;ted with the Money, will be as a Council of State, to con|troul all Your Councils. And as to Your Exchequer, I do not find any Inclination to con&s;ider Your Nece&s;&s;ity, unle&s;s many things be done to put them into another Di&s;po&s;ition, than I can ob&s;erve in them. The Things that will be de|manded, will not be of &s;o ea&s;y a Dige&s;tion, as that I can ima|gine You will ever be brought to them, or indeed that it will be rea&s;onable or honourable for You to grant them. So that, in this Di&s;order of Affairs, it is ea&s;y to propo&s;e Difficulties, but not &s;o ea&s;y to find out that, which may remove them.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;There is one thing, and indeed the only thing, in which all hone&s;t Men agree, as that which can ea&s;ily extricate You out of all Your Troubles; it is not the Change of a Mini&s;ter, or of a Council, a new Alliance, or a Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, but it is (and &s;uffer me, Sir, to &s;peak it with a more than ordi|nary Earne&s;tne&s;s) a Change in Your own Heart, and in Your Cour&s;e of Life. And now, Sir, if You do not with Indigna|tion throw this Paper from You, permit me (with all the Hu|mility of a Subject pro&s;trate at your Feet) to tell you, That all the Di&s;tru&s;t Your People have of You, all the Nece&s;&s;ities You now are under, all the Indignation of Heaven, that is upon You, and appears in the defeating all Your Councils, flow from this, That You have not feared nor &s;erved God, but have given your&s;elf up to &s;o many &s;inful Plea&s;ures. Your Maje&s;ty may perhaps ju&s;tly think, that many of tho&s;e that oppo&s;e You have no regard for Religion, but the Body of Your People con&s;ider it more than you can imagine. I do not de&s;ire Your Maje&s;ty to put on a hypocritical Shew of Religion, as <HI>Henry</HI> the Third of <HI>France</HI> did, hoping thereby to have weathered the Storms of tho&s;e Times. No! that would be &s;oon &s;een through, and as it would provoke God more, &s;o it would encrea&s;e Jealou&s;ies. No! Sir, it mu&s;t be real, and the Evidences of it &s;ignal: All tho&s;e about You who are the occa&s;ions of Sin, chiefly the Women, mu&s;t be removed, and Your Court be reformed. Sir, if You will turn You to Religion &s;incerely and &s;eriou&s;ly, You &s;hall quickly find a &s;erene Joy of another nature po&s;&s;e&s;s your Mind, than what ari&s;es from gro&s;s Plea&s;ures; God would be at peace with You, and direct and ble&s;s all Your Coun&s;els; all good Men would pre&s;ently turn to You, and ill Men would be a&s;hamed, and
<PB N="688" REF="716">
have a thin Party. For I &s;peak it knowingly, there is nothing has &s;o alienated the Body of Your People from You, as what they have heard of Your Life, which di&s;po&s;es them to give an ea&s;y Belief to all other &s;candalous Reports.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Sir, this Coun&s;el is now almo&s;t as nece&s;&s;ary for Your Affairs as it is for Your Soul; and though You have highly offended that God, who has been infinitely merciful to You, in pre|&s;erving You at <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> Fight, and during Your long Exile, and who brought You back &s;o miraculou&s;ly, yet he is &s;till good and gracious; and will, upon Your &s;incere Repentance, and Change of Life, pardon all Your Sins and receive You into his Favour: Oh, Sir, what if You &s;hould die in the mid&s;t of all Your Sins? at the great Tribunal, where You mu&s;t appear, there will be no regard to the Crown You now wear; but it will aggravate Your Puni&s;hment, that being in &s;o eminent a Station, You have &s;o much di&s;honoured God. Sir, I hope, You believe there is a God, and a Life to come, and that Sin &s;hall not pa&s;s unpuni&s;hed. If Your Maje&s;ty will reflect upon Your having now been twenty Years upon the Throne, and in all that time how little You have glorified God, how much You have provoked him, and that Your ill Example has drawn &s;o many after You to Sin, that Men are not now a&s;hamed of their Vices, You cannot but think, that God is offended with You: And if You con&s;ider how ill Your Councils at home, and Your Wars abroad have &s;ucceeded, and how much You have lo&s;t the Hearts of Your People, You may rea&s;onably conclude, this is of God, who will not turn away his Anger from You, till You turn to him with Your whole Heart.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;I am no Enthu&s;ia&s;t, either in Opinion or Temper; yet I acknowledge, I have been &s;o pre&s;s'd in my Mind to make this Addre&s;s to You, that I could have no ea&s;e till I did it: And &s;ince you were plea&s;ed to direct me to &s;end You, through Mr. <HI>Chi&s;&s;inch</HI>'s hands, &s;uch Informations as I thought fit to convey to You, I hope Your Maje&s;ty will not be offended, if I have made this u&s;e of that Liberty. I am &s;ure I can have no other De&s;ign in it, but Your Good; for I know very well, this is not the Method to &s;erve any Ends of my own. I there|fore throw my&s;elf at Your Feet, and once more, in the Name of God, who&s;e Servant I am, do mo&s;t humbly be&s;eech Your Maje&s;ty, to con&s;ider of what I have written, and not to de|&s;pi&s;e it for the Meanne&s;s of the Per&s;on, who has &s;ent it; but to apply Your&s;elf to Religion in earne&s;t: And I dare a&s;&s;ure You of many Ble&s;&s;ings both Temporal and Spiritual in this Life, and of eternal Glory in the Life to come: But if You
<PB N="689" REF="717">
will go on in Your Sins, the Judgments of God will probably pur&s;ue You in this Life, &s;o that You may be a Proverb to After-Ages; and after this Life, You will be for ever mi&s;erable; and I, Your poor Subject that now am, &s;hall be a Witne&s;s again&s;t You in the great Day, that I gave You this free and faithful Warning.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Sir, no Per&s;on alive knows, that I have written to You to this purpo&s;e; and I cho&s;e this Evening, hoping that Your Exerci&s;e to-morrow may put You into a Di&s;po&s;ition to weigh it more carefully. I hope Your Maje&s;ty will not be offended with this &s;incere Expre&s;&s;ion of my Duty to You; for I dur&s;t not have ventured on it, if I had not thought my&s;elf bound to it, both by the Duty I owe to God, and that which will ever oblige me to be,&endq;</Q></P>

<P>This is the Letter, of which &s;ome mention is made in Page 507, of the Fir&s;t Volume of the Hi&s;tory, as likewi&s;e of the effect it produced: It conveys to the Reader a much &s;tronger Idea of the Author's Character, than any De&s;cription can give; and I pre&s;ume, it will &s;carce be thought a Step, which any Clergyman would have taken, who aimed more at Preferment than the &s;trict Di&s;charge of his Duty.</P>
<P>The unprejudiced Part our Author acted, during the whole Time that the Nation was inflamed with the Di&s;covery of the <HI>Popi&s;h Plot;</HI> his candid Endeavours to have &s;aved the Lives of <HI>Staley</HI> and the Lord <HI>Stafford,</HI> both zealous Papi&s;ts; his tempe|rate Conduct in regard to the Exclu&s;ion of the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> and the Scheme of a Prince Regent, propo&s;ed by him, in lieu of that Exclu&s;ion; are all &s;ufficiently related in the Hi&s;tory: This only may be farther ob&s;erved, that his Behaviour, in this critical Juncture, was &s;o impartial, as to di&s;plea&s;e both the Court and the Country Party; which, when Animo&s;ities run high, will always be the Fate of tho&s;e few, who follow the Dictates of their own Judgment and Con&s;cience, without entring into the con|certed Mea&s;ures of any one Set of Men. A Character as valua|ble as it is rare.</P>
<P>In 1682, when the Admini&s;tration was wholly changed, in fa|vour <NOTE PLACE="marg">His firm Ad|herence to his Friends.</NOTE> of the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> the Courtiers thought them&s;elves at liber|ty to rail at our Author; as if his Writings and Sermons again&s;t Po|pery had been only calculated, to facilitate the Project of the Exclu|&s;ion. Yet &s;o little did the Court regard the Reflections which were thrown upon him, that it being likely the Ma&s;ter&s;hip of the <HI>Temple</HI> would be &s;oon vacant, the Earls of <HI>Halifax</HI> and <HI>Clarendon</HI> obtained

the King's Promi&s;e of it for him: Upon which he was again &s;ent for by His Maje&s;ty, and received with peculiar Marks of Favour and Kindne&s;s. But the&s;e were &s;oon withdrawn, and he him&s;elf waved the Promi&s;e made him; when he found it was expected, he &s;hould break off Corre&s;pondence with &s;ome of his be&s;t Friends. And as, during the Debates concerning the Exclu&s;ion, he had lo&s;t all his Intere&s;t with Lord <HI>Shaftesbury</HI> and the Country Party, on account of his Intimacy with the Earl of <HI>Halifax,</HI> and his En|deavours to ju&s;tify, or at lea&s;t excu&s;e the Earl's Conduct in that Affair: So now he cho&s;e rather to &s;acrifice all the Advantages, he might reap from that Lord's great Power at Court, than to abandon the Society of the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> the Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> and Sir <HI>William Jones.</HI> As he was, at this time, much re&s;orted to by Per&s;ons of all Ranks and Parties, in order to avoid the nece&s;|&s;ity of returning Vi&s;its, he built a <HI>Laboratory,</HI> and for above a Year went through a Cour&s;e of Chemical Experiments; which, as it &s;erved to enlarge his Philo&s;ophical Notions, and was in it&s;elf an u&s;eful, as well as an innocent Amu&s;ement, &s;o it furni&s;h'd him with a proper Excu&s;e for &s;taying much at home. The Earl (&s;oon after created Marqui&s;s) of <HI>Halifax</HI> complains of this Retire|ment in a Letter, which I &s;hall here in&s;ert.</P>

<P><Q>&startq;THough I was tender in advi&s;ing you to wave any thing you might think advantageous for you, yet &s;ince you have thought fit to do it, I am at liberty to approve it: And I only de&s;ire you will not make too ha&s;ty Re&s;olutions concern|ing your&s;elf, and not be carried &s;o far by the &s;udden Motions of a &s;elf-denying Genero&s;ity, as to &s;hut the Door again&s;t tho&s;e Advantages, which you may expect with Ju&s;tice, and may re|ceive without Indecency.

<P>In the Year 1683, when the <HI>Rye Plot</HI> broke out, and the <NOTE PLACE="marg">How he avoided be|ing involved in any Plots.</NOTE> Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> and Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> were taken into Cu&s;tody, all who knew his long and &s;trict Friend&s;hip with tho&s;e Great Men, concluded that he would have been involved in the &s;ame Accu|&s;ation. But as it had been his con&s;tant Principle, that Re&s;i&s;tance was not lawful, on account of &s;ingle Acts of Inju&s;tice or Oppre&s;|&s;ion, unle&s;s the very Ba&s;is of the Con&s;titution was &s;truck at; &s;o in order to avoid being drawn into Secrets, he could not approve, he had declared to all tho&s;e he convers'd with, that 'till he &s;hould be convinced that Re&s;i&s;tance was warrantable, he &s;hould think it his Duty to di&s;clo&s;e all Con&s;ultations, which he was made privy to, tending to that End. By this Declaration, his mo&s;t intimate Friends, when they entered into Cabals of this nature, were &s;ufficiently warned again&s;t communicating their De&s;igns to him. And this now proved his Security.</P>
<P>His Behaviour at the Trial of the Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el;</HI> his Attendance on him in Pri&s;on, and afterwards upon the Scaffold, at the time of his Execution; the Examination he underwent before the Council, in relation to that Lord's Dying Speech, and the Bold|ne&s;s with which he there undertook to vindicate his Memory; as al&s;o the Indignation the Court expre&s;s'd again&s;t him, upon that occa&s;ion; are all fully &s;et forth in the Hi&s;tory. Thither I mu&s;t likewi&s;e refer the Reader, for an Account of the &s;hort Tour our Author took to <HI>Paris,</HI> and of the unu&s;ual Civilities there &s;hewn him, by the King of <HI>France</HI>'s expre&s;s Direction. His Friends at Court would indeed have per&s;uaded him to a longer &s;tay there; they apprehended great Severities were preparing for

him at home, which they repre&s;ented in the &s;tronge&s;t Light: But neither their Intreaties, nor the Menaces of his Enemies could prevent his returning to <HI>London.</HI> He &s;aid, <Q>&startq;That as he was con&s;cious of no Crime, which could be truly laid to his charge, &s;o he would not alarm him&s;elf, with the continual Apprehen|&s;ion of what fal&s;e Witne&s;&s;es might invent again&s;t him: That how fatal &s;oever his Return might prove, he could not think him&s;elf at liberty to be ab&s;ent from the Duties of his Function.&endq;</Q> This Objection was indeed &s;oon after removed; for he was, that very Year, di&s;charged from his Lecture at <HI>St. Clement's,</HI> in pur|&s;uance <NOTE PLACE="marg">Is di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his Lecture, and from the <HI>Rolls.</HI></NOTE> of the King's Mandate to Dr. <HI>Ha&s;card,</HI> Rector of that Pa|ri&s;h: And in <HI>December</HI> 1684, by an extraordinary Order from the Lord Keeper <HI>North</HI> to Sir <HI>Harbottle Gram&s;ton,</HI> he was forbid preaching any more in the Chapel at the <HI>Rolls.</HI></P>
<P>Thus at the Time of King <HI>Charles</HI>'s Death, he was happily di&s;engaged from all tho&s;e Ties, which might have rendered his <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Travels beyond Sea.</NOTE> Stay in <HI>England</HI> any part of his Duty. Upon King <HI>James</HI>'s Ac|ce&s;&s;ion to the Crown therefore, he de&s;ired his leave to go out of the Kingdom; which the Marquis of <HI>Halifax</HI> ea&s;ily obtained, the Court regarding him as one, whom they had no pro&s;pect of gain|ing, and whom it was their Intere&s;t therefore to keep out of the way. He fir&s;t went to <HI>Paris,</HI> where he lived in great Retirement, in order to avoid being involved in any of the Con&s;piracies, which the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s Friends were then forming in his favour. When that Rebellion was at an end, having contracted an Ac|quaintance with Brigadier <HI>Stouppe,</HI> a Prote&s;tant Officer then in the <HI>French</HI> Service, he was prevailed upon to take a Jour|ney with him into <HI>Italy;</HI> though many of his Friends thought it a bold Venture, con&s;idering how remarkably he had &s;ignalized him&s;elf, in the Controver&s;y with the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church. But as he was not him&s;elf of a Con&s;titution, very &s;ubject to Fear, &s;o the Advice of the Lord <HI>Mountague,</HI> who was then at <HI>Paris,</HI> en|couraged him to embrace this Opportunity of &s;eeing <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>The Relation of the&s;e Travels is &s;o amply given, in <HI>The Letters</HI> our Author publi&s;hed in the Year 1687, that there will be no occa&s;ion to add any thing here concerning them; except as to one Particular, which may &s;erve as a Proof, both of the great Regard paid him abroad, and of his own uniform Zeal for Toleration. He was much care&s;&s;ed and e&s;teemed by the principal Men of <HI>Geneva;</HI> He &s;aw they in&s;i&s;ted &s;trongly upon their <HI>Con&s;ent of Doctrine</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is a Formulary commonly known by the Name of the <HI>Con&s;en&s;us.</HI></NOTE>, which they required all tho&s;e to &s;ub&s;cribe, who were admitted into Orders. He therefore employed all the Eloquence he was
<PB N="693" REF="721">
Ma&s;ter of, and all the Credit he had acquired among&s;t them, to ob|tain an Alteration in this Practice: He repre&s;ented to them the Folly and ill Con&s;equence of &s;uch Sub&s;criptions; whereby the hone&s;te&s;t and worthie&s;t Men were frequently reduced to the Nece&s;&s;ity of quitting their Native Country, and &s;eeking a Sub&s;i&s;tence el&s;ewhere; whil&s;t others of le&s;s Virtue were induced to &s;ubmit, and comply again&s;t their Con&s;cience, and even begin their Mini&s;try with mental Equivocations. The Warmth, with which he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf on this Head, was &s;uch, and &s;uch was the weight of his Character, that the Clergy at <HI>Geneva</HI> were afterwards re|lea&s;ed from the&s;e Sub&s;criptions, and only left &s;ubject to Puni&s;h|ment or Cen&s;ure, in ca&s;e of writing or preaching again&s;t the e&s;tabli&s;hed Doctrine.</P>

When he was made acquainted with the Secret of their Councils, he advi&s;ed the putting the Fleet of <HI>Hol|land</HI> immediately into &s;uch Order, as might give Courage to their Friends in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> in ca&s;e Matters there &s;hould come to Extremities; he prevailed upon both their Highne&s;&s;es, to write a Letter to King <HI>James,</HI> in favour of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> who was then under Su&s;pen&s;ion; he ventured to propo&s;e to the Prince&s;s, the explaining her&s;elf, upon that nice but nece&s;&s;ary Point, of the Share the Prince was to expect in the Government, in ca&s;e the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Crown &s;hould devolve on her; and when it was deter|mined to &s;end over Mr. <HI>Dyckvelt,</HI> as Amba&s;&s;ador to <HI>England,</HI> our Author was employed to draw his &s;ecret In&s;tructions, of which the rough Draught is &s;till extant, in his own hand.</P>

<P>Our Author maintained an un&s;haken Credit with King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> during their whole Reign; indeed the King's Favour was &s;ometimes interrupted, with &s;hort Di&s;|gu&s;ts, at the uncourtly Liberty he took of &s;peaking his Mind, even upon &s;ome Subjects that he perceived were di&s;agreeable; but the real E&s;teem tho&s;e Princes had for him will appear be|yond Conte&s;t, from &s;everal Facts in the Hi&s;tory, too numerous to be recapitulated here, and from &s;ome others, which I &s;hall here|after have occa&s;ion to mention. The u&s;e he made of this Credit, is the principal Point, a Writer of his Life mu&s;t be con|cerned for: It is that alone, mu&s;t &s;ettle his real Character, which I am &s;atisfy'd has been too commonly mi&s;taken; and never more egregiou&s;ly, than by tho&s;e, who have repre&s;ented him as an <HI>Inveterate Party-Man.</HI> That he was &s;tedfa&s;t to his fir&s;t <NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ $word$ $word$ to P$r|$span$ Mat$span$.</NOTE> Principles; that in all his Conduct relating to the Publick, he

was rigidly &s;trict to the&s;e; is a Truth too much to his Honour, for me to di&s;pute: But it will be ea&s;y to demon&s;trate, that his own particular way of thinking, as to Party-Matters, had no In|fluence over him, either in his Friend&s;hips, in his Charities, or in his Preferments, where the Publick was not immediately con|cerned. It might be tedious, I am &s;ure it would be voluminous, here to in&s;ert all the Evidences in my hands, from whence it ap|pears, how frequently his whole Intere&s;t was exerted in favour of Men, who neither from their publick nor their private Conduct, had any rea&s;on to expect &s;uch Services from him. Some In|&s;tances of this nature, I &s;hall have occa&s;ion el&s;ewhere to produce; but I &s;hall content my&s;elf here with one, which is very remarka|ble, and may alone be &s;ufficient to e&s;tabli&s;h his Reputation on this head. Some of the har&s;he&s;t Treatment, he had met with in the two former Reigns, had pa&s;s'd through the hands of the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter;</HI> no two Men ever differed more widely in their Prin|ciples, both in Church and State: yet the fir&s;t good Offices done that Earl, with the King and Queen (after all other Applications for Introduction had failed) their entire Reconciliation to him, and the fir&s;t Advantages he reaped in con&s;equence of that Reconcilia|tion, were owing to our Author. And when the Earl of <HI>Claren|don</HI> was afterwards unhappily engaged in the Con&s;piracy, again&s;t the Government, in 1690; and &s;ome hotter Whigs were for the &s;evere&s;t Methods, the Bi&s;hop became a hearty and &s;ucce&s;sful Ad|vocate in his favour. The&s;e Matters are but cur&s;orily mentioned in the Hi&s;tory, but will more fully appear from the four following original Letters; the fir&s;t written by the Counte&s;s of <HI>Ranelagh,</HI> the other three by the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> him&s;elf.</P>

Nor can he, in my poor opinion, give you a clearer Proof of his being already over|come by you, than in chu&s;ing you to be the Per&s;on, to whom he would in &s;uch an Intere&s;t be obliged: Since he thereby puts him&s;elf upon the Peril of being faithfully Yours, or a very un|thankful Man; which I do &s;o much a&s;&s;ure my&s;elf he will not be, that I humbly beg your Lord&s;hip to put this Obligation upon him, to perfect what you have already begun to do for him, of a like nature, and to the &s;ame Royal Per&s;on.

<P><Q>&startq;THE good Offices, your Lord&s;hip has told me, you have endeavoured to do me with the Queen, of your own Accord and Genero&s;ity, incline me to be de&s;irous to be obliged to your Lord&s;hip, for the Favour of pre&s;enting the enclo&s;ed Petition to her Maje&s;ty.

reading it, the Occa&s;ion and the Subject of it; and I am &s;ure I need not &s;ugge&s;t any thing to your own kind Thoughts, to add at the Delivery of it, &s;ave only this, which I thought not proper to touch in the Petition, that I have certainly as good a Title in Law to it, as any Man has to any thing he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es; as likewi&s;e that the Pen&s;ion is appropriated, to be paid out of a part of the Revenue, which never was de&s;igned by any Act of Parliament, for any publick U&s;e of the Government: which I think has &s;omething of Weight and Rea&s;on, to di&s;|tingui&s;h it from tho&s;e Pen&s;ions, that are placed on the more publick Branches of the Revenue.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;I know not, whether the Queen can do me any good in this Affair, but I will believe her Maje&s;ty cannot but wi&s;h &s;he could; however, I think, I &s;hould have been very wanting to my Children, if I had not laid this Ca&s;e mo&s;t humbly before her Maje&s;ty: Le&s;t at one time or other, &s;he her&s;elf might &s;ay, I had been too negligent in not making Applications to her; which having now done, I leave the re&s;t, with all po&s;&s;ible Sub|mi&s;&s;ion, to her own Judgment, and to the Reflections, that &s;ome good-natured Moments may incline her to make to|wards my Family. I &s;hould &s;ay a great deal to your Lord|&s;hip, for my own Confidence, in addre&s;&s;ing all this to your Lord&s;hip, &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages of my Life having been &s;uch, as may very properly give it that Name: But, I think, whatever you would be content to hear on that Subject, will be better ex|pre&s;&s;ed by the Per&s;on, who does me the honour to deliver this to your Lord&s;hip, from&endq;</Q></P>

<P><Q>&startq;UPON what account &s;oever it is, that your Lord&s;hip is plea&s;ed to let me hear from you, I take it to be &s;ome|thing of good fortune, what&s;oever ill cau&s;e there may be in it too. Therefore I humbly thank your Lord&s;hip for the ho|nour of yours of the 18th from <HI>Salisbury;</HI> which was &s;ent me to this pretty Place, where I love to be, as much as you do at your Palace; and though I cannot do &s;o much Good to others, as your Lord&s;hip does there to all that are near you, yet I do more to my&s;elf, than I can do any where el&s;e. <HI>Quid &s;entire putas, quid credis, amice, precari?

aevi.</HI> Forgive this tran&s;gre&s;&s;ional Rapture, and receive my Thanks, which I pay your Lord&s;hip again, for your kind Let|ter: For indeed I do take it very kindly, that you were &s;o much concerned, as to give me a kind hint of that un&s;ea&s;onable Di&s;cour&s;e, you came to be acquainted with, when you were la&s;t in <HI>London:</HI> I will make the be&s;t u&s;e of it, I can; to pre|vent the like for the future, if I have any Credit. And in the mean time, I mu&s;t make u&s;e of this opportunity, to calm and &s;often your Re&s;entments, towards this Friend of mine, as you call him in the beginning of your Letter. I will allow you, as a Servant to the King and Queen, and a Subject to their Crown, to have as great a Dete&s;tation of the Contrivance, as you can wi&s;h; and upon my Word, I can accompany you in it. But when I con&s;ider you, as once you were, a concern'd Friend of this Lord, to have a re&s;pect for his Family, and particu|larly for my Father, who lo&s;t not only all the Honours and Preferments of this World, but even the Comforts of it too, for the Integrity and Uprightne&s;s of his Heart: You mu&s;t for|give me, if I conjure you, by all that's Sacred in this Genera|tion in which we live together, by the Character that you bear, and by the Religion you profe&s;s, that you do not (as much as in you lies) &s;uffer this next Heir of my good Father's Name and Honour, to go down with Sorrow to the Grave. I would not flatter my&s;elf, that your Lord&s;hip &s;hould be moved with any Fondne&s;s of mine, to endeavour to bring to pa&s;s, what is not fit for a wi&s;e and a good Man to propo&s;e; that would be to make a very ill u&s;e of your Friend&s;hip to me, and I would rather be corrected my&s;elf in my own De&s;ires, than expo&s;e your Lord&s;hip on &s;uch an account. But I hope that they, who are the &s;upreme Directors of this Matter under God, may in their great Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s judge, that it may prove as much to their Honour and Safety too, to pa&s;s over this Particular, as if they &s;hould pur&s;ue the &s;tricte&s;t Mea|&s;ures of Ju&s;tice in it. Though I am a Brother, if I did not, upon the greate&s;t Reflection I can make, think I &s;hould be of the &s;ame opinion, if I were none, I would not pre&s;s this Mat|ter upon you. For I cannot but think, that the Queen would do, and would be glad to avow it too, a very great thing for the Memory of that Gentleman, &s;o long in his Grave. It is upon his account, I am begging of your Lord&s;hip, to do all that's po&s;&s;ible, to pre&s;erve every Part and Branch and Member of his Family, from the lea&s;t tran&s;ient Stain of Infamy and Reproach. And if God was prevailed with by <HI>Abraham,</HI> to have &s;aved a whole City for the &s;ake of ten righteous Men, I
<PB N="704" REF="732">
hope there may be as charitable an Inclination, to &s;pare the <HI>Debris</HI> of our broken Family, for the &s;ake of him, who was the Rai&s;er of it.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;I ask your Lord&s;hip's Pardon, for being thus importunate; for I have great need of your help, and I hope I &s;hall have it from you. Lo&s;&s;es of many and good Friends I have born, and &s;ubmitted with patience to the Plea&s;ure of Almighty God: But a Calamity of this nature, that I now deprecate, has in it &s;omething &s;o frightful, and on &s;ome accounts &s;o unnatural; that I beg you for God's &s;ake, from an angry Man your&s;elf, grow an Advocate for me and for the Family on this account.

<P><Q>&startq;I Was warm, I confe&s;s, in the la&s;t Letter I gave your Lord|&s;hip the trouble of, and I thank you for reproving the Vehemence of my Stile, in your la&s;t of the 28th; I am grown cooler, and acknowledge my Fault; neither did I com|mit it, with an Apprehen&s;ion that your Lord&s;hip was inexorable, or that it would be &s;o much as needful to de&s;ire your A&s;&s;i&s;tance in that Matter. But you may remember, you had u&s;ed a Word to me, when you were here, <HI>an Attainder;</HI> that I acknowledge &s;ounded very har&s;h to me, and when I had reflected a little more upon it, as likewi&s;e that your Lord&s;hip did not u&s;e to &s;peak by chance, and con&s;equently that you had good ground for what you &s;aid, I own it heated me all over; which made me expre&s;s my Thoughts to you, with more Tran&s;port than was fit, and I will &s;ay no more of them, for fear of running into new Exce&s;&s;es. What your Lord&s;hip propo&s;es for my Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI> to de&s;ire, is perfectly agreeable to my Mind; but I know not, whether it be not a little too early, and that &s;uch a Petition might be pre&s;ented with a better Grace, if he were once out of the <HI>Tower</HI> upon Bail, than it would be while he is under this clo&s;e Confinement. But as your Lord&s;hip &s;ays, the Affair of <HI>Mons</HI> mu&s;t for the pre&s;ent put a &s;top to every Man's private Thoughts, for that is a Matter of &s;uch va&s;t Im|portance to the Publick, that it is but very fit, that all particu|lar Con&s;iderations &s;hould give way to it, and wait the Deter|mination of that great Point; I cannot but believe the <HI>French</HI> are Ma&s;ters of it before now, becau&s;e all the Letters, that came
<PB N="705" REF="733">
by the la&s;t Po&s;t, that I could hear of, looked upon it, as a thing impracticable to relieve it, but we have had no Letters &s;ince <HI>Saturday.</HI> What the <HI>French</HI> will do next, whether &s;end their Men into Quarters for two Months, or try to follow their Blow, is what Men are now mo&s;t anxious about. One of my old Friends, with whom of late I have renewed my Acquain|tance, &s;ays upon all the&s;e mighty occa&s;ions, <HI>Prudens futuri temporis exitum Galigino&s;a nocte premit Deus Ridetque &s;i morta|lis ultra Fas trepidat.</HI> But I confe&s;s to you, I cannot be quite &s;o overcome with Philo&s;ophy, as not to be concerned before|hand, at what this dark Night is to bring forth. One private Concern, in the mid&s;t of all the&s;e publick ones, has given me a great deal of Unea&s;ine&s;s, and I doubt not will do &s;o to your Lord&s;hip, when I tell you how very ill my Lady <HI>Ranelagh</HI> has been the&s;e two or three Days, with a Fever, which has almo&s;t quite de&s;troyed her; I am afraid &s;till for her: the la&s;t Night &s;he had a little Re&s;t; but &s;he is &s;o weak, and, you know, of late has been &s;o very tender, that I am in great pain for her. I know your Lord&s;hip will be troubled to lo&s;e a very good Friend and humble Servant of your own, as well as a mo&s;t wonderful good Per&s;on, to all that knew her. For my own part, I know no body alive, to whom I have &s;o many Obliga|tions, which I am &s;orry to &s;ee how little I can return, when there is mo&s;t need of &s;erving her. Among&s;t all her Favours, one that I &s;hall never forget was, her De&s;ire and Endeavours, not only to renew for me the Acquaintance, I formerly had with your Lord&s;hip, but to knit it clo&s;er into a Friend&s;hip; in which I am always to own your Lord&s;hip's ready Concur|rence; and, I hope, I &s;hall not fail, as faithfully to perform all the part, that belongs to,&endq;</Q></P>

<P>Hitherto the Reader has view'd our Author, as a Divine, only in the private Character of a Mini&s;ter in his Pari&s;h, a Profe&s;&s;or in his Chair, or a Preacher in his Lecture; but we mu&s;t now ob&s;erve his Conduct in a higher Function. As &s;oon as the Se&s;&s;ion of Par|liament in 1689 was ended, he went down to his Dioce&s;e; where he formed &s;uch a Plan, for executing the Duties of his Epi&s;copal Office, as he &s;eldom afterwards had occa&s;ion to alter.</P>
<P>His primary Vi&s;itation could only be regulated, by the <NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$.</NOTE> Practice of his Predece&s;&s;ors, who contented them&s;elves with formal Triennial Vi&s;itations of their Dioce&s;e, in which they
<PB N="706" REF="734">
u&s;ed always to confirm; but when he perceived the Hurry, the Di&s;order and Noi&s;e, that attended the&s;e publick Meetings, he thought them wholly unfit for &s;olemn Acts of Devotion: They &s;eemed much properer, for the Exerci&s;e of an <HI>Ordinary</HI>'s Juri&s;diction ac|cording to Law, than for the Performance of the more Chri&s;tian Functions of a Bi&s;hop: The&s;e were incon&s;i&s;tent with that Pomp and Shew, which perhaps the other required. He had always looked upon <HI>Confirmation,</HI> as the likelie&s;t means of reviving a Spirit of Chri&s;tianity; if Men could be brought to con&s;ider it, not as a meer Ceremony, but as an Act whereby a Man became a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> from his own Choice; &s;ince upon attaining to the u&s;e of Rea&s;on, he thereby renewed for him&s;elf a Vow, which others had only made for him at Bapti&s;m. He wrote a &s;hort <HI>Directory,</HI> containing proper Rules how to prepare the Youth upon &s;uch occa&s;ions; this he printed, and &s;ent Copies of it, &s;ome Months beforehand, to the Mini&s;ter of every Pari&s;h, where he intended to confirm. He every Summer took a Tour, for &s;ix Weeks or two Months, through &s;ome Di&s;trict of his Bi&s;hoprick, daily preaching and confirming from Church to Church, &s;o as in the Compa&s;s of three Years (be&s;ides his formal Triennial Vi&s;itation) to go through all the principal Livings in his Dioce&s;e. The Clergy, near the Places he pa&s;&s;ed through, generally attended on him; therefore, to avoid being burthen&s;ome in the&s;e Circuits, he enter|tained them all at his own Charge. He likewi&s;e, for many Years, entred into Conferences with them, upon the chief Heads of Divi|nity: One of which he u&s;ually opened at their meeting, in a Di&s;cour&s;e that la&s;ted near two Hours; and then encouraged tho&s;e pre&s;ent, to &s;tart &s;uch Que&s;tions or Difficulties upon it, as occur'd to them. Four of the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es again&s;t Infidelity, Sociniani&s;m, Popery and Schi&s;m, were printed in the Year 1694. When our Author had publi&s;hed <HI>His Expo&s;ition of the Thirty-nine Ar|ticles,</HI> Conferences of this nature &s;eemed in &s;ome mea&s;ure need|le&s;s: He therefore di&s;continued them, in order to apply him&s;elf wholly to the Work of <HI>Confirmation.</HI> To be more u&s;eful in it, he di&s;po&s;ed his annual Progre&s;s, during the la&s;t ten Years of his Life, in the following manner. He went through five or &s;ix of the con&s;iderable Market-Towns every Year: he fix'd him&s;elf for a whole Week in each of them; and though he went out every Morning, to preach and confirm in &s;ome Pari&s;h, within &s;even or eight Miles of the Place; yet at the Evening-Prayer, for &s;ix Days together, he catechi&s;ed the Youth of the Town, in the principal Church there, expounding to them &s;ome Portion of the <HI>Church-Catechi&s;m</HI> every Day, 'till he had gone through the whole: And on <HI>Sunday,</HI> he confirmed tho&s;e, who had been thus examin'd
<PB N="707" REF="735">
and in&s;tructed, and then inviting them all to dine with him, he gave to each a u&s;eful Pre&s;ent of Books. As the Country flocked in, from all Parts, to hear him; he was in hopes this would encourage the Clergy to Catechi&s;e more, and would rai&s;e an Emulation in Chri&s;tian Knowledge, among the inferiour &s;ort of People, who were ignorant to a &s;candal.</P>
<P>In the Intervals of Parliament, when the Bi&s;hop was not upon this Progre&s;s, his u&s;ual Re&s;idence was at <HI>Salisbury;</HI> there he preached the <HI>Thur&s;day's</HI> Lecture, founded at <HI>St. Thomas's</HI> Church, during the whole time of his Stay; he likewi&s;e preached and confirmed every <HI>Sunday</HI> Morning <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was &s;o punctual in this, that no Change of Weather could ever induce him, to di&s;appoint any Congregation where he was expected: And this A&s;&s;iduity had well high co&s;t him his Life, in the Year 1698. For having appointed to preach and confirm, at the Pari&s;h Church of <HI>D$$ton,</HI> within twelve Miles of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> on a prefixed <HI>Sunday,</HI> the Rains, that fell on that Day, and for &s;ome Days before, had &s;o &s;welled a Brook, which he was to cro&s;s, that his Coach was over|turned in the Water, and his own Life hardly &s;aved by a Miller, who jumped in and drew the Bi&s;hop out of the Water: for which &s;ea&s;onable Service, our Author paid him a yearly Gratuity all the re&s;t of his Life</NOTE>, in &s;ome Church of that City, or of the Neighbourhood round about it: And in the Evening he had a Lecture in his own Chappel, to which great Crouds re&s;orted, wherein he explained &s;ome Portion of Scripture, out of the Go&s;pels and Epi&s;tles in the Liturgy. He generally came down from <HI>London,</HI> &s;ome Days before <HI>Lent,</HI> on purpo&s;e to prepare the Youth of the two great Schools for Confirmation; by catechizing them every Week, during that Sea&s;on, in the <HI>Cathedral</HI> Church, and in&s;tructing them in the &s;ame manner, as he did tho&s;e in the other Towns of his Dioce&s;e. And to ren|der this Task of In&s;truction more ea&s;y to the re&s;t of his Clergy, he at length publi&s;hed an <HI>Explanation of the Church-Catechi&s;m</HI> in the Year 1710.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop's Con&s;i&s;torial Court, being much cry'd out again&s;t, as a Grievance both to the Clergy and Laity, he endeavoured to reform it, and for &s;ome Years went thither in Per&s;on; but tho' he might do &s;ome little Good by this Attendance, it was &s;o little, that he at la&s;t gave it over; for the true Foundation of Com|plaints was, the dilatory Cour&s;e of Proceedings, and the ex|orbitant Fees, which the Bi&s;hop had no Authority to correct: Nay, he could not even di&s;charge poor Suitors, who were op|pre&s;s'd there with vexatious Pro&s;ecutions, any otherwi&s;e than by paying their Fees him&s;elf, as he frequently did.</P>
<P>No part of the Epi&s;copal Office was more &s;trictly attended to by him, than the Examination of tho&s;e, who came for Orders: in this Matter the Law has left the Bi&s;hop entirely at liberty, to admit or refu&s;e. He never turned them over to the Care of a Chaplain or Archdeacon, farther than to try their Skill in the learned Languages. He examined them him&s;elf as to the Proofs
<PB N="708" REF="736">
of the Chri&s;tian Religion, the Authority of the Scriptures, and the Nature of the Go&s;pel-Covenant. If they were deficient in tho&s;e, he di&s;mi&s;s'd them at once, with proper Directions how to be better prepared for a &s;econd Trial: But if they were competently knowing in the&s;e e&s;&s;ential Points, he went through the other Heads of Divinity with le&s;s &s;trictne&s;s. When he was once &s;atisfied with their Capacity, he next directed his Di&s;cour&s;e to their Con&s;cience: He laid before them the Ba&s;ene&s;s of taking up a Sacred Profe&s;&s;ion, merely for the Lucre or Sub&s;i&s;tence it might afford; he gave them a di&s;tinct View of all the Branches of the <HI>Pa&s;toral Care,</HI> (of which he publi&s;hed a Treati&s;e, for the u&s;e of his Dioce&s;e, in 1692;) and endeavoured &s;trongly to di&s;&s;uade them from entring into Holy Orders, unle&s;s they were firmly re&s;olved to perform all the Duties of their Function; more particularly to lead &s;uch Lives, as might not contradict the Doctrines, they were to teach. A Day or two before Ordination, he &s;ubmitted all tho&s;e whom he had accepted, to the Examination of the Dean and Prebendaries, that &s;o he might have their Approbation.</P>
<P>In the Admi&s;&s;ion of Pre&s;entees, he could not be &s;o &s;trict; the Law having in &s;ome mea&s;ure taken the Judgment of their Quali|fications out of the Ordinary; yet in this he went unu&s;ual lengths, of which I &s;hall mention one &s;ingular in&s;tance <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">$span$well known to $word$ and $span$s now all.</NOTE> In the latter part of the Reign of Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> the Lord Chancellor pre&s;ented the younger Son of a noble Family in <HI>Oxford&s;hire</HI> to a Par&s;onage within his Dioce&s;e, which was in the Gift of the Crown. Upon Trial, our Author found him &s;o ignorant, that he refu&s;ed to in&s;titute him; the Mini&s;try threaten'd him with a Law-Suit, but finding him re&s;olute, they at length acquie&s;ced under the Refu&s;al. Thereupon the Bi&s;hop &s;ent for the young Gentleman, and told him, <Q>&startq;That as his Patrons had given up the Conte&s;t, and he had no De&s;ign to do him any per&s;onal In|jury, if he could prevail on his Friends, to keep the Benefice vacant, he him&s;elf would undertake the Charge of qualifying him for it. Accordingly he took &s;uch happy pains in his In|&s;truction,&endq;</Q> that &s;ome Months after, the Pre&s;entee pa&s;s'd Exami|nation with Applau&s;e, and had In&s;titution given him to the Living.</P>
<P>As the <HI>Pa&s;toral Care,</HI> and the admitting none to it, who were not duly qualified, was always uppermo&s;t in his Thoughts, he concluded that he could not render a more u&s;eful Ser|vice to Religion, to the Church, and more e&s;pecially to his own Dioce&s;e, than by forming under his Eye a number of Divines,
<PB N="709" REF="737">
well in&s;tructed in all the Articles of their Duty. He re&s;olved therefore, at his own Charge, to maintain a &s;mall Nur&s;ery of Students in Divinity at <HI>Salisbury,</HI> who might follow their Studies, till he &s;hould be able to provide for them. They were ten in number, to each of whom he allowed a Salary of thirty Pounds a-year: They were admitted to him once every day, to give an account of their Progre&s;s in Learning, to propo&s;e to him &s;uch Difficulties as they met with, in the cour&s;e of their Reading, and to hear a Lecture from him, upon &s;ome Speculative or Practical Point of Divinity, or on &s;ome part of the Pa&s;toral Function, which la&s;ted above an Hour: During the Bi&s;hop's ab&s;ence, the learned Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI> &s;upplied his Place, in overlooking and directing their Studies. By this means, our Author educated &s;everal young Clergymen, who proved an honour to the Church; but as this came to be con&s;idered as a pre&s;ent Provi&s;ion, with &s;ure Expecta|tions of a future Settlement, he was continually importuned, and &s;ometimes impo&s;ed upon, as to the Per&s;ons recommended to be of this number: And the Foundation it&s;elf was &s;o maliciou&s;ly exclaimed at, as a de&s;ign'd Affront upon the Method of Educa|tion at <HI>Oxford,</HI> that he was prevailed upon, after &s;ome Years, to lay it wholly a&s;ide.</P>
<P>Our Author was a warm and con&s;tant Enemy to <HI>Pluralities</HI> of Livings, not indeed where the two Churches lay near each other, and were but poorly endowed, for in that ca&s;e he rather encouraged them; as knowing the <HI>Labourer was worthy of his Hire.</HI> But when&s;oever <HI>Non-Re&s;idence</HI> was the Con&s;equence of a Plurality, he u&s;ed his utmo&s;t Endeavours to prevent it, and in &s;ome Ca&s;es even hazarded a Su&s;pen&s;ion, rather than give In&s;titution. In his Charges to the Clergy, he exclaimed again&s;t Pluralities, as a &s;acrilegious Robbery of the Revenues of the Church; a remarkable Effect of his Zeal upon this Subject may not be improper to be here related <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Fact was told me by Mr. <HI>Wa&s;tefield,</HI> and is well known ag <HI>Salisbury</HI></NOTE>. In his fir&s;t Vi&s;itation at <HI>Salisbury,</HI> he urged the Authority of St. <HI>Ber|nard,</HI> who being con&s;ulted by one of his Followers, whe|ther he might not accept of two Benefices, reply'd, <Q>&startq;And how will you be able to &s;erve them both? I intend (an|&s;wered the Prie&s;t) to officiate in one of them by a Deputy. Will your Deputy be damn'd for you too? (cry'd the Saint.) Believe me, you may &s;erve your Cure by Proxy, but you mu&s;t be damn'd in Per&s;on. This Expre&s;&s;ion &s;o affected Mr. <HI>Kel&s;ey,&endq;</HI></Q> a pious and worthy Clergyman there pre&s;ent, that he imme|diately re&s;igned the Rectory of <HI>Bemerton,</HI> worth Two Hundred
<PB N="710" REF="738">
Pounds a-year, which he then held with one of greater Value. Nor was this Chri&s;tian Act of Self-denial without its Reward; for though their Principles in Church Matters were very oppo|&s;ite, the Bi&s;hop conceived &s;uch an E&s;teem for him, from this Action, that he not only prevailed with the Chapter to elect him a Canon, but likewi&s;e made him Archdeacon of <HI>Sarum,</HI> and gave him one of the be&s;t Prebends in the Church.</P>

<P>Yet when this Spirit of <HI>Moderation,</HI> of which the Non|jurors felt the good Effects, was extended to the Di&s;$enters, our Author's Enemies repre&s;ented him, as betraying the Church into their hands; though he was really taking the mo&s;t effectual means to bring them over, not indeed by Compul&s;ion, but by the more Chri&s;tian Methods of Charity and Per&s;ua&s;ion: In which he was &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, that many Di&s;&s;enting Families, in his Dioce&s;e, were by him brought over to the Communion of our Church, in which they &s;till continue; and of two Pre&s;|byterian Preachers, who were well &s;upported when he fir&s;t

<P>He perceived that the chief Strength of the Sectaries lay in the <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Scheme for aug|menting poor Livings in his own <HI>Dioce&s;e.</HI></NOTE> Market-Towns; the Livings there were mo&s;t commonly in the Gift of the Lord Chancellor; and as the Lord <HI>Somers,</HI> during his Enjoyment of the Seals, left the Nomination to tho&s;e in the Dio|ce&s;e of <HI>Sarum,</HI> to the Bi&s;hop; he endeavoured to place in them none but learned, pious and moderate Divines, as being the be&s;t qualified to prevent the Growth of Schi&s;m. But as the&s;e Bene|fices were generally &s;mall, and a poor Church will be too often &s;erved by as poor a Clerk; our Author determin'd to obviate this Difficulty, by be&s;towing upon the&s;e Cures the Prebends in his Gift, as they became vacant; and till &s;uch a Vacancy happen'd, out of his own Income he allowed the Mini&s;ter of every &s;uch Church a Pen|&s;ion of Twenty Pounds a-year <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This appears from his Steward's Accounts, and was confirmed to me by Mr <HI>Wa&s;tefield.</HI></NOTE>: When the Prebend it&s;elf was con|ferred upon him, the Bi&s;hop in&s;i&s;ted on his giving a Bond to re|&s;ign it, if ever he quitted the Living. Though this Matter had been laid before the mo&s;t eminent Prelates and Divines of our Church, as well as the mo&s;t learned among the Canoni&s;ts, who highly approved the De&s;ign; yet it was &s;o warmly oppo&s;ed by &s;ome of the Clergy, that in order to rai&s;e no farther Strife in the Church, our Author was prevailed on to relinqui&s;h this Project, and give up all the Bonds he had taken. But as he could not, without the tendere&s;t Concern, behold the de&s;titute Condition of the&s;e poor Benefices, mo&s;t of which were attended with the large&s;t Cure of Souls; &s;o his Di&s;appointment in this Scheme, he had formed for his own Bi&s;hoprick, only gave occa&s;ion to a more univer&s;al Plan, which he projected for the Improvement of all the &s;mall Livings in <HI>England,</HI> and which was liable to no Ex|ception. This he pre&s;s'd forward with &s;o much Succe&s;s, that it terminated at length in an Act of Parliament, pa&s;s'd in the &s;econd Year of Queen <HI>Anne, for the Augmentation of the Maintenance of the poor Clergy.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>MEMORIAL</HI> concerning the Fir&s;t Fruits and Tenths. Given in to the King in <HI>January</HI> 1696 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Memorial in the Bi&s;hop's own Hand, with a Memorandum when it was delivered, is in the Editor's hands.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P><Q>&startq;THE Tenths and Fir&s;t Fruits were fir&s;t laid on by Popes, on pretence of &s;upporting the Holy War; in the twenty-&s;ixth Year of the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, the&s;e were given to the Crown; and &s;ince that time have been granted away in Pen&s;ions, by dormant Warrants. They are now in the hands of the Duke of <HI>St. Albans,</HI> Counte&s;s of <HI>Pli|mouth,</HI> Counte&s;s of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> Earl of <HI>Bath,</HI> Earl of <HI>Oxford</HI> and a few others. This Revenue may ju&s;tly be called in que&s;tion, as unlawful and &s;acrilegious in its nature; the applying it to a good u&s;e is the be&s;t way to ju&s;tify it.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The condition of many Livings in this Kingdom is mo&s;t mi&s;e|rable; many have not Twenty Pounds, and in &s;ome places, three of them put together do not amount to Forty Pounds a-year. A poor Clergyman may be &s;candalous, but he mu&s;t be con|temptible and ignorant. To this, in a great mea&s;ure, we owe the Athei&s;m and Impiety, the Sects and Divi&s;ions, that are &s;pread over the Nation.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;It would be a noble Demon&s;tration, both of Zeal for the Honour of God and Religion, and Affection for the Church of <HI>England,</HI> if the King would appropriate this Revenue, to the rai&s;ing of the Livings in this Nation to &s;ome ju&s;t Propor|tion, beginning at tho&s;e in Corporations, and tho&s;e within the King's Gift, but not excluding others, upon condition that the King &s;hall have his Turn in pre&s;enting, in proportion to the Augmentation that &s;hall be made by this Provi&s;ion.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;A Corporation might be &s;ettled, as was from the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> down to that of <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t, with power to receive the Gifts of Charitable Per&s;ons, to the &s;ame Pious End: And all Bi&s;hops, Deans and Chapters might be obliged to pay towards it a Fourth or Fifth of every Fine that they received.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;This, by the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, would make the Concerns of Religion and of the Church put on another Face, it would much rai&s;e his Maje&s;ty's Name and Character in the pre&s;ent, and in all &s;ucceeding Ages; by this the King gives away no|thing, that is in his own Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; he only gives away the Power of granting &s;uch new Pen&s;ions, as may be vacant in his
<PB N="714" REF="742">
Time. And there is little doubt to be made, (be&s;ides a Ble&s;|&s;ing from God, which may be expected upon &s;o noble a De|&s;ign) that this would be madeup to the Crown by Parliament: And would al&s;o give &s;uch an Impre&s;&s;ion of the King, as would have good Effect on all his Affairs.&endq;</Q></P>

<HEAD>A Second <HI>MEMORIAL</HI> concerning the Tenths and Fir&s;t Fruits. Given in to the King in <HI>December</HI> 1697 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Memorial in the Bi&s;hop's own Hand, with a Memorandum when he delivered it, is in $span$</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P><Q>&startq;IT is humbly propo&s;ed, that his Maje&s;ty would be plea&s;ed to con&s;ider, how proper it will be at this Time, to declare his Re&s;olution of applying the Fir&s;t Fruits and Tenths to mending the State of the poor Livings in <HI>England.&endq;</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The Peace being now concluded, this will be a noble Be|ginning of his Maje&s;ty's Reign in Peace, and a &s;uitable Re|turn to God, for his great Ble&s;&s;ings on his Royal Per&s;on and Affairs; it will gain him the Hearts of all true Friends of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> and &s;ince the Burroughs are generally the wor&s;t &s;erved, their Livings being univer&s;ally very &s;mall, this may probably have a great Effect on all the King's Affairs, perhaps on the &s;ucceeding Elections of Parliament.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;If his Maje&s;ty be re&s;olved to do it, it is humbly &s;ugge&s;ted, that he would declare his Re&s;olution in the Trea&s;ury, and ap|point the Commi&s;&s;ioners to acquaint the Hou&s;e of Commons with it, who will no doubt very quickly make it up to the Crown. Upon this, it is propo&s;ed, that the King will order a Commi&s;&s;ion for managing this Fund, and making it mo&s;t ef|fectual to the End intended by it.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The Per&s;ons proper for &s;uch a Commi&s;&s;ion, would be the two Archbi&s;hops, with two other Bi&s;hops, the Lord Chan|cellor, the Lord Privy-Seal, the two Secretaries of State, the fir&s;t Commi&s;&s;ioner of the Trea&s;ury, the Chancellor of the Ex|chequer, the two Chief Ju&s;tices, the Chief Baron, and the King's Attorney-General.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>Though this Propo&s;al was highly acceptable to the King; though it was &s;trongly &s;econded by the Prince&s;s of <HI>Denmark,</HI> who de&s;ired Copies to be given her of the two foregoing Memo|rials; yet underhand it met with &s;uch Oppo&s;ition among&s;t the Mini&s;try, as for a time ob&s;tructed the Execution of it. The Bi&s;hop would not however be di&s;couraged in it; but renewed his Sollicitations upon this Head, &s;o powerfully, in the Year 1701, that nothing but the Death of King <HI>William</HI> could have prevented
<PB N="715" REF="743">
its then taking effect. He had concerted his Mea&s;ures upon this occa&s;ion, with the Earl of <HI>Godolphin</HI> (who afterwards carried this De&s;ign into Execution) and with the Lord <HI>Somers,</HI> who&s;e Let|ter upon that Subject I &s;hall here in&s;ert.</P>

<P>Having thus given a &s;hort Account of every principal Part of our Author's Conduct, that properly relates to his Epi&s;copal Cha|racter, of which I thought the Reader would be be&s;t able to judge, if it were laid before him in one general View, without any &s;trict regard to the Series of Time; I &s;hall now return to the Thread of my Narration, by relating the other remarkable Incidents of his Life, in the Order, in which they happened.</P>
<P>The Year 1694 proved greatly unfortunate to him, I might <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Death of Queen <HI>Mary</HI> and of Archbi&s;hop <HI>Tillot&s;on.</HI></NOTE> have &s;aid to the whole Nation, by the Death of Archbi&s;hop <HI>Til|lot&s;on;</HI> a Name too well known to need an Encomium; who&s;e Funeral Sermon our Author preach'd, and who&s;e Vindication he undertook, again&s;t a Writer, who had virulently attack'd his Me|mory. This great Lo&s;s to the Church was &s;oon after followed by a greater, that of the excellent Queen MARY, who had always honoured our Author with a high degree of Favour and Confi|dence. The &s;trong Impre&s;&s;ion her uncommon Talents and &s;hining Qualities had made upon him, occa&s;ioned that <HI>E&s;&s;ay on her Cha|racter,</HI> which he publi&s;h'd in the Year 1695.</P>
<P>During her Life, the Affairs and Promotions in the Church had <NOTE PLACE="marg">He is one of the Eccle|$span$cal Commi&s;&s;ion to recom|mend to Pre$er|ments</NOTE> wholly pa&s;s'd through her hands; it was an Article of Govern|ment, for which the King thought him&s;elf unqualified, yet was unwilling to commit to the Care of his Mini&s;ters: Upon her Death therefore, a Commi&s;&s;ion was granted to the two Arch|bi&s;hops,
<PB N="716" REF="744">
to our Author, and to three other Prelates; whereby they, or any three of them, were appointed to recommend to all Bi&s;hopricks, Deanries, or other vacant Preferments in the Church, &s;ignifying the &s;ame to his Maje&s;ty, by writing under their hands: And during the King's Ab&s;ence beyond Sea, they were empowered, of their own Authority, to pre&s;ent to all Benefices in the Gift of the Crown, that were under the Value of an Hundred and Forty Pounds a-year. A like Commi&s;&s;ion was granted in the Year 1700, and the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Salisbury</HI> continued &s;till to be of the Number. It would be tedious here to enumerate the &s;everal Marks King <HI>William</HI> gave him, of his Friend&s;hip, during the whole Cour&s;e of his Reign; but though he obtained of his Ma|je&s;ty Employments, Pen&s;ions and Gratuities for others, even to the Value of Ten Thou&s;and Pounds to <HI>One Per&s;on</HI> now living; yet there was not one &s;ingle In&s;tance, wherein he &s;ollicited a Fa|vour for him&s;elf or his Family: On the contrary, he declined Preferment when it was offered to him.</P>
<P>In the Year 1698, when it became nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ettle the Duke of <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI>'s Family, the King &s;ent the Earl of <HI>Sunderland,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Is made Pre|ceptor to the Duke of <HI>Glouce&s;ter.</HI></NOTE> with a Me&s;&s;age to the Prince&s;s of <HI>Denmark,</HI> acquainting her, <Q>&startq;That he put the whole Management of her Son's Hou&s;hold into her hands, but that he owed the Care of his Education to him|&s;elf and his People, and therefore would name the Per&s;ons for that purpo&s;e. Accordingly the Earl of <HI>Marlborough</HI> being&endq;</Q> nominated his Governour, the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Salisbury</HI> was appointed his Preceptor. He was then retired into his Dioce&s;e, having lately lo&s;t his Wife by the Small Pox. He took that occa&s;ion therefore to wave the Offer of this important Charge; though he was a&s;&s;ured, <NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ be $word$ $span$|t$ decline.</NOTE> the Prince&s;s had te&s;tify'd her Approbation of the King's Choice.

<P>The Method he pur&s;ued in the Duke of <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI>'s Education, and the amazing Progre&s;s made in it, during the &s;hort time that Prince was under his Care, are mentioned in the Hi&s;tory: To which I &s;hall only add, that he conducted him&s;elf in &s;uch a manner, that the Prince&s;s of <HI>Denmark</HI> ever after retained a pecu|liar Regard for him, of which he received &s;ome &s;en&s;ible Marks, when &s;he came to the Throne, even at Times, when he was en|gaged in a publick Oppo&s;ition to the Mea&s;ures of her Mini&s;ters.</P>

This Work was afterwards peru&s;ed and approved by Archbi&s;hop <HI>Tenni&s;on,</HI> Archbi&s;hop <HI>Sharp,</HI> Bi&s;hop <HI>Stillingfleet, Patrick, Lloyd, Hall</HI> and <HI>Williams:</HI> The la&s;t of the&s;e &s;trongly recommended, the con&s;idering them only as Articles of Peace, in which Men were bound to acquie&s;ce without Contradiction; not as Articles of Faith, which they were obliged to believe. There might perhaps be rea&s;on to wi&s;h, that they had only been impo&s;ed as &s;uch, but there was nothing in our Con&s;titution to warrant an Expo&s;itor, in giving that Sen&s;e to them: The Book likewi&s;e pa&s;s'd through the hands of many learned Men in both <HI>Univer&s;ities,</HI> and was generally ap|plauded. Upon its fir&s;t Appearance in Print, it was univer&s;ally well received; tho&s;e, who had been employed to critici&s;e every Work the Bi&s;hop had publi&s;hed for &s;ome Years, were &s;ilent as to This. Indeed when the Convocation met, and the two Hou&s;es were warmly engaged in Di&s;putes, relating to their re&s;pective Privi|leges, in which our Author bore a con&s;iderable Share; the Lower Hou&s;e, in Re&s;entment, brought up a general Cen&s;ure of <HI>His Ex|po&s;ition,</HI> but refu&s;ed to point out the Particulars, upon which it was grounded: Though the Upper Hou&s;e remon&s;trated, how ne|ce&s;&s;ary that was, in order to enable them to concur in the Cen|&s;ure, which they could not pretend to do, till they were informed of the Rea&s;ons for it.</P>
<P>For five or &s;ix Years before his Death, our Author grew more ab&s;tracted from the World, than the Situation he had been in, during the former Parts of his Life, had permitted. To avoid the Di&s;traction of u&s;ele&s;s Vi&s;its, he &s;ettled in <HI>St. John's Court</HI> in <HI>Cler|kenwell,</HI> and kept up only an Intercour&s;e with his mo&s;t &s;elect and intimate Acquaintance: Their Names will be an Honour to his Memory, and therefore I beg leave to mention the mo&s;t con&s;ide|rable among&s;t them. Such were the late Dukes of <HI>Marlborough, Newca&s;tle</HI> and <HI>Shrewsbury;</HI> the Earls of <HI>Godolphin, Cowper</HI> and <HI>Halifax;</HI> the Lord <HI>Somers</HI> and <HI>Pelham:</HI> And the pre&s;ent Dutche&s;s Dowager of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> the Dukes of <HI>Montro&s;e</HI> and <HI>Roxburgh;</HI> the Lord <HI>Town&s;hend,</HI> the Lord <HI>King,</HI> the Ma&s;ter of the Rolls Sir <HI>Jo&s;eph Jekyll,</HI> the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Eyre,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Baillie</HI> of <HI>Jervi&s;wood,</HI> who, as he was his near Relation, &s;o he always lived with him in the Friend&s;hip and Freedom of a Brother.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid nothing in relation to the Part our Author acted <NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$.</NOTE> in Parliament, in Convocation, or in the &s;everal Matters of State, wherein he was con&s;ulted and employed; this is fully and impar|tially &s;et forth in the Hi&s;tory it&s;elf. Yet I ought to inform the Reader, that the Bi&s;hop's nece&s;&s;ary Attendance on the Hou&s;e of Lord, in the Winter Sea&s;on, was not a means of abating his
<PB N="721" REF="749">
Diligence in the Duties of his Calling, though it diverted the Exerci&s;e of it, from the proper Scene, his Dioce&s;e. For whil&s;t he &s;taid in Town, he failed not of preaching every <HI>Sunday</HI> Morning, in &s;ome Church or other in <HI>London;</HI> and as he was much followed, he was generally engaged for Charity Sermons, at which he him&s;elf was always a liberal Contributor: In the <HI>Sunday</HI> Evening, he had a Lecture in his own Hou&s;e, upon &s;ome &s;elect Portion of Scripture; to which many Per&s;ons of Di&s;tinction re|&s;orted, though at fir&s;t it was only intended, for the Benefit of his own Family.</P>
<P>As he lived to &s;ee the Turn, which the Affairs of <HI>Great Bri|tain,</HI> I might &s;ay of <HI>Europe,</HI> took upon the Death of Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> for whom he always had the highe&s;t per&s;onal Veneration, but whom he thought unwarily engaged in Mea&s;ures, which might have proved fatal: I need not &s;ay, with what comfort he &s;aw a Succe&s;&s;ion take place, of which he him&s;elf had been the <HI>fir&s;t Mover;</HI> and a Family e&s;tabli&s;hed, in who&s;e Intere&s;ts he had been &s;o &s;tedfa&s;t and zealous, and by whom he had been &s;o much entru&s;ted. He publi&s;hed a <HI>Third Volume,</HI> as a Supplement to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Writes a <HI>Third Volume</HI> as a Supple|ment to his <HI>Hi&s;tory of the Reformation.</HI></NOTE> his two former, <HI>of the Hi&s;tory of the Reformation,</HI> at the time of his late Maje&s;ty's Arrival in <HI>England,</HI> to whom it was dedicated. And as if his Life had only been prolonged to &s;ee this great Work compleat, and the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t in a fair Pro&s;pect of Security, he died &s;oon after.</P>
<P>Thus I have endeavoured to give &s;ome Account of our Au|thor's <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Do|me&s;tick Character.</NOTE> Behaviour, in all the different Stations he pa&s;s'd through in Publick: it may be expected, I &s;hould &s;ay &s;omething of him, in Dome&s;tick Life.</P>
<P>His Time, the only Trea&s;ure of which he &s;eemed covetous, <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Time how em|ployed.</NOTE> was employed in one regular and uniform manner. His con&s;tant Health permitted him to be an early Ri&s;er, he was &s;eldom in Bed later than five a-Clock in the Morning during the Summer, or than &s;ix in the Winter. Private Meditation took up the two fir&s;t Hours and the la&s;t Half-Hour of the Day. His fir&s;t and la&s;t Ap|pearance to his Family was, at the Morning and Evening Prayers, which were always read by him&s;elf, though his Chaplains were pre&s;ent. He drank his Tea in company with his Children, and took that opportunity of in&s;tructing them in Religion; he went through the Old and New Te&s;tament with them three times, giving his own Comment upon &s;ome Portion of it, for an Hour every Morning. When this was over, he retired to his Study, where he &s;eldom &s;pent le&s;s than &s;ix, often more than eight Hours in a Day. The re&s;t of his Time was taken up with
<PB N="722" REF="750">
Bu&s;ine&s;s, Exerci&s;e and nece&s;&s;ary Re&s;t, or be&s;towed on friendly Vi&s;its and chearful Meals. As he kept an open Table, in which there was Plenty without Luxury, &s;o no Man was more plea&s;ed with innocent Mirth there, no Man encouraged it more, or had a larger Fund of Entertainment to contribute towards it. His Equipage, like his Table, was decent and plain; and all his Expences denoted a Temper generous, but not profu&s;e. The Epi&s;copal Palace, when he came to <HI>Salisbury,</HI> was thought one of the wor&s;t; and when he died, was one of the be&s;t in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Character I have given his Wives, will &s;carce make it <NOTE PLACE="marg">An affectio|nate Hu&s;|band.</NOTE> an Addition to his, that he was a mo&s;t affectionate Husband. His tender Care of the fir&s;t, during a Cour&s;e of Sickne&s;s, that la&s;ted for many Years; and his fond Love to the other two, and the deep Concern he expre&s;s'd for their Lo&s;s, were no more than their ju&s;t due, from one of his Humanity, Gratitude and Di&s;|cernment.</P>
<P>His Love to his Children, perhaps accompanied with too <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Care of his Chil|dren's Edu|cation.</NOTE> much Indulgence, was not exerted in laying up for them a Hoard of Wealth, out of the Revenues of the Church, but in giving them a noble Education; though the Charge of it was wholly maintained out of his private Fortune. At &s;even Years old, he entered his Sons into <HI>Latin,</HI> giving each of them a di&s;tinct Tutor, who had a Salary of Forty Pounds a-year, which was never le&s;&s;en'd on account of any Prebend the Bi&s;hop gave him. After five or &s;ix Years had perfected his Sons in the Learned Languages, he &s;ent them to the <HI>Univer&s;ity;</HI> the Elde&s;t a Gentleman Commoner to <HI>Trinity College</HI> in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> the other Two Commoners to <HI>Merton College</HI> in <HI>Oxford;</HI> where, be&s;ides the College Tutor, they had a private one, to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in their Learning, and to overlook their Behaviour. In the Year 1706, he &s;ent them abroad for two Years to fini&s;h their Studies at <HI>Leyden;</HI> from whence two of them took a Tour through <HI>Germany, Switzerland</HI> and <HI>Italy.</HI> The Elde&s;t and Younge&s;t, by their own Choice, were bred to the Law, and the &s;econd to Divinity.</P>
<P>In his Friend&s;hips, our Author was warm, open-hearted and <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Firm|ne&s;s in his Friend&s;hips.</NOTE> con&s;tant: From tho&s;e I have taken the liberty to mention, the Reader will perceive, that they were formed upon the mo&s;t pru|dent Choice, and I cannot find an In&s;tance of any one Friend he ever lo&s;t, but by Death. It is a common, perhaps a ju&s;t Ob&s;er|vation, That a hearty Friend is apt to be as hearty an Enemy; yet this Rule did not hold in our Author. For though his Sta|tion, his Principles, but above all his &s;tedfa&s;t Adherence to the <HI>Hanover Succe&s;&s;ion,</HI> rai&s;ed him many Enemies; yet he no &s;ooner had it in his power, to have taken &s;evere Revenges on them, than
<PB N="723" REF="751">
he endeavoured, by the kinde&s;t good Offices, to repay all their Injuries, and overcome them, by returning Good for Evil. I have already given &s;ome In&s;tances of this nature here, and many more will occur to the Reader in the Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop was a kind and bountiful Ma&s;ter to his Servants, <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Conduct to tho&s;e in Employ|ment under him.</NOTE> whom he never changed, but with Regret and through Nece&s;|&s;ity: Friendly and obliging to all in Employment under him, and peculiarly happy in the Choice of them; e&s;pecially in that of the Steward to the Bi&s;hoprick and his Courts, <HI>William Wa&s;te|field,</HI> E&s;&abque; (a Gentleman of a plentiful Fortune, at the time of his accepting this Po&s;t) and in that of his Dome&s;tick Steward Mr. <HI>Mackney.</HI> The&s;e were both Men of approved Worth and Integrity, firmly attach'd to his Intere&s;ts, and were treated by him, as they well de&s;erved, with Friend&s;hip and Confidence. To them, I mu&s;t appeal, for the Truth of many Facts here re|lated, particularly tho&s;e concerning his Labours in his Dio|ce&s;e; from them I likewi&s;e had an Account of his exten&s;ive Charities.</P>
<P>This was indeed a principal Article of his Expence, impo&s;&s;ible <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Chari|ties.</NOTE> now to fix as to all the Particulars; our Author being as &s;ecret, as he was liberal, in tho&s;e Charities, which he di&s;tributed with his own hands: Yet the greate&s;t part of them could not be hid from the Per|&s;ons, who were entru&s;ted with the Management of his Affairs. His Gifts, for the Augmentation of &s;mall Livings, of an Hundred Pounds at a time; his con&s;tant Pen&s;ions to poor Clergymen, to their Widows, to Students for their Education at the Univer&s;ities, and to indu&s;trious Families, that were &s;truggling with the World; the frequent Sums given by him, towards the Repairs or Building of Churches and Vicarage-Hou&s;es; his liberal Contribution, to all publick Collections, to the Support of Charity-Schools (one of which for Fifty Children at <HI>Salisbury</HI> was wholly maintained by him,) and the many Apprentices, at different times put out to Trades at his Charge, were Charities that could not be wholly concealed. Nor were his Alms confined to one Nation, Sect or Party; Want and Merit in the Object were the only Mea&s;ures of his Liberality. Thus when Mr. <HI>Martin</HI> (Mini&s;ter of <HI>Compton Chamberlein)</HI> for refu&s;ing to take the Oaths to the Government, &s;oon after the Revolution, had forfeited his Prebend in the Church of <HI>Sarum;</HI> the Bi&s;hop, out of his own Income, paid him the yearly Value of it, during his Life. His u&s;ual Allowance for Charity was Five Hundred Pounds a-year, which he often exceeded; particularly in the two Years, that he was Preceptor to the Duke of <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> in which time this Article amounted to One and Twenty Hundred Pounds. In a word, no Object
<PB N="724" REF="752">
of Chri&s;tian Compa&s;&s;ion ever came within his Knowledge, with|out receiving a proportionable Relief. He looked upon him&s;elf, with regard to his Epi&s;copal Revenue, as a meer Tru&s;tee for the Church, bound to expend the whole, in the Maintenance of a decent Figure &s;uitable to his Station, in Ho&s;pitality, and in Acts of Charity. And he had &s;o faithfully ballanced this Account, that at his Death no more of the Income of his Bi&s;hoprick re|mained to his Family <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This Mr. <HI>Mackney</HI> his Steward a&s;&s;ured me ap|peared in his A$span$</NOTE>, than what was barely &s;ufficient for the Payment of his Debts.</P>
<P>But if he was thus liberal of his own Pur&s;e, he was not le&s;s <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Care of the Revenue of the See.</NOTE> &s;trict in pre&s;erving the Revenues of his See, for the Benefit of his Succe&s;&s;ors, of which this remarkable In&s;tance may &s;uffice <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This I had from the Mini&s;ter $word$ <HI>Monckton Farley,</HI> and many others at the Time, and it was confirmed to me $word$ by Mr. <HI>$span$field</HI> and Mr <HI>M$span$</HI></NOTE>. One of his Predece&s;&s;ors had converted a large E&s;tate at <HI>Monckton Farley,</HI> held of the Bi&s;hop, from a Lea&s;e of One and Twenty Years, into an E&s;tate for three Lives, and had received a valua|ble Con&s;ideration for &s;o doing. Our Author re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to re&s;tore it to the former Tenure, as being much more advanta|geous to the See: when therefore one of the Lives fell, he refu&s;ed to renew; and when, the other two Lives being very unhealthy, Sir <HI>John Talbot</HI> offered him a Thou&s;and Pounds for the Renewal of that one Life, and the Change of the other two, he &s;till per|&s;i&s;ted in his Refu&s;al: Till at length the Tenant, apprehending the whole E&s;tate would have fallen in, agreed to accept of a Lea&s;e for One and Twenty Years, for which the Bi&s;hop would take no more than Four Hundred Pounds Fine to him&s;elf; but made it part of his Agreement, that the Tenant &s;hould pay Ten Pounds yearly Rent, to the Mini&s;ter of the Pari&s;h, as a perpetual Augmentation to that poor Living, be&s;ides the u&s;ual Re&s;erved Rent to the See.</P>
<P>In <HI>March</HI> 1714/15, being the Seventy-&s;econd Year of his Age, our Author was taken ill of a violent Cold, which &s;oon turned <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Death</NOTE> to a Pleuritick Fever; he was attended in it, by his worthy Friend and Relation Dr. <HI>Cheyne,</HI> who treated him with the utmo&s;t Care and Skill: But finding the Di&s;temper grew to a height, which &s;eemed to baffle all Remedies, he called for the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Sir <HI>Hans Sloane</HI> and Dr. <HI>Mead,</HI> who quickly found his Ca&s;e was de&s;perate. His Character was too well known, to induce any one to conceal from him the Danger his Life was in. He bore the Notice of it, with that calm Re&s;ignation to Providence, which had always &s;upported him under the &s;evere&s;t Trials. As he pre&s;erved his Sen&s;es to the la&s;t, &s;o he employed the precious Remnant of Life, in continual Acts of Devotion, and in
<PB N="725" REF="753">
giving the be&s;t Advice to his Family; of whom he took leave, in a manner, that &s;hewed the utmo&s;t Tenderne&s;s, accompanied with the firme&s;t Con&s;tancy of Mind. And whil&s;t he was &s;o little &s;en&s;ible of the Terrors of Death, as to embrace its Approach with Joy; he could not but expre&s;s a Concern, for the Grief he &s;aw it cau&s;ed in others. He died on the Seventeenth Day of that Month.</P>
<P>It would be a Pre&s;umption in me to attempt the drawing his Character; when it has been done by &s;o elegant a Hand, as that of the late Marqui&s;s of <HI>Halifax:</HI> As this beautiful Piece, I believe, has never been made publick, the Reader will pardon my in&s;erting it here.</P>

His fir&s;t Thoughts may &s;ometimes require more Dige&s;tion, not from a Defect in his Judgment, but from the Abundance of his Fancy, which furni&s;hes too fa&s;t for him. His Friends love him too well, to &s;ee &s;mall Faults; or if they do, think that his greater Talents give him a Privilege of &s;traying from the &s;trict Rules of Caution, and exempt him from the ordinary Rules of Cen|&s;ure. He produces &s;o fa&s;t, that what is well in his Writings calls for Admiration, and what is incorrect de&s;erves an Excu&s;e; he may in &s;ome things require Grains of Allowance, which tho&s;e only can deny him, who are unknown or unju&s;t to him. He is not quicker in di&s;cerning other Men's Faults, than he is in forgiving them; &s;o ready, or rather glad to acknowledge his own, that from Blemi&s;hes they become Ornaments. All the repeated Provocations of his indecent Adver&s;aries, have had no other Effect, than the &s;etting his Good-Nature in &s;o much a better Light; &s;ince his Anger never yet went farther than to pity them. That Heat, which in mo&s;t other Men rai&s;es Sharpne&s;s and Satire, in him glows into Warmth for his Friends, and Compa&s;&s;ion for tho&s;e in Want and Mi&s;ery. As dull Men
<PB N="726" REF="754">
have quick Eyes, in di&s;cerning the &s;maller Faults of tho&s;e, that Nature has made &s;uperior to them, they do not mi&s;s one Blot he makes; and being beholden only to their Barrenne&s;s for their Di&s;cretion, they fall upon the Errors, which ari&s;e out of his Abundance; and by a Mi&s;take, into which their Malice be|trays them, they think that by finding a Mote in his Eye, they hide the Beams, that are in their own. His Quickne&s;s makes Writing &s;o ea&s;y a thing to him, that his Spirits are neither wa&s;ted nor &s;oured by it: The Soil is not forced, every thing grows, and brings forth without Pangs; which di&s;tingui&s;hes as much what he does, from that which &s;mells of the Lamp, as a good Palate will di&s;cern between Fruit, which comes from a rich Mould, and that which ta&s;tes of the uncleanly Pains, that have been be&s;towed upon it. He makes many Enemies, by &s;etting an ill-natured Example of Living, which they are not in|clined to follow. His Indifference for Preferment, his Con|tempt not only of Splendour, but of all unnece&s;&s;ary Plenty, his degrading him&s;elf into the lowe&s;t and mo&s;t painful Duties of his Calling; are &s;uch unprelatical Qualities, that let him be never &s;o orthodox in other things, in the&s;e he mu&s;t be a Di&s;|&s;enter. Virtues of &s;uch a &s;tamp are &s;o many Here&s;ies, in the opinion of tho&s;e Divines, who have &s;oftened the Primitive In|junctions, &s;o as to make them &s;uit better with the pre&s;ent Frailty of Mankind.
