<LETTER>
<OPENER>To DR. LEWIS.
DEAR LEWIS,</OPENER>
<P>YOUR fable of the monkey and the
pig, is what the Italians call <HI>ben
trovata:</HI> but I &s;hall not repeat it to my
apothecary, who is a proud Scotchman,
very thin &s;kinned, and, for aught I know,
may have his degree in his pocket&mdash;A
right Scotchman has always two &s;trings
to his bow, and is <HI>in utrumque paratus</HI>&mdash;
Certain it is, I have not '&s;caped a &s;cour|ing;
but, I believe, by means of that
<PB N="2" REF="4">
&s;couring, I have '&s;caped &s;omething wor&s;e,
perhaps a tedious fit of the gout or rheu|mati&s;m;
for my appetite began to &s;lagg,
and I had certain croakings in the bowels,
which boded me no good&mdash;Nay, I am
not yet quite free of the&s;e remembrances,
which warn me to be gone from this
centre of infection&mdash;</P>
<P>What temptation can a man of my turn
and temperament have, to live in a place
where every corner teems with fre&s;h ob|jects
of dete&s;tation and di&s;gu&s;t? What
kind of ta&s;te and organs mu&s;t tho&s;e peo|ple
have, who really prefer the adulte|rate
enjoyments of the town to the ge|nuine
plea&s;ures of a country retreat?
Mo&s;t people, I know, are originally &s;e|duced
by vanity, ambition, and childi&s;h
curio&s;ity; which cannot be gratified, but
in the <HI>bu&s;y haunts of men:</HI> but, in the cour&s;e
of this gratification, their very organs of
&s;en&s;e are perverted, and they become ha|bitually
lo&s;t to every reli&s;h of what is
genuine and excellent in it's own na|ture.</P>
<P>Shall I &s;tate the difference between my
town grievances, and my country com|forts?
At Brambleton-hall, I have el|bow-room
within doors, and breathe a
clear, ela&s;tic, &s;alutary air&mdash;I enjoy re|fre&s;hing
<PB N="3" REF="5">
&s;leep, which is never di&s;turbed
by horrid noi&s;e, nor interrupted, but in
a-morning, by the &s;weet twitter of the
martlet at my window&mdash;I drink the vir|gin
lymph, pure and cry&s;talline as it
gu&s;hes from the rock, or the &s;parkling
beveridge, home-brewed from malt of my
own making; or I indulge with cyder,
which my own orchard affords; or with
claret of the be&s;t growth, imported for
my own u&s;e, by a corre&s;pondent on who&s;e
integrity I can depend; my bread is &s;weet
and nouri&s;hing, made from my own
wheat, ground in my own mill, and
baked in my own oven; my table is, in a
great mea&s;ure, furni&s;hed from my own
ground; my five-year old mutton, fed
on the fragrant herbage of the mountains,
that might vie with veni&s;on in juice and
flavour; my delicious veal, fattened with
nothing but the mother's milk, that fills
the di&s;h with gravy; my poultry from
the barn-door, that never knew confine|ment,
but when they were at roo&s;t; my
rabbits panting from the warren; my game
fre&s;h from the moors; my trout and &s;al|mon
&s;truggling from the &s;tream; oy&s;ters
from their native banks; and herrings,
with other &s;ea-fi&s;h, I can eat in four hours
after they are taken&mdash;My &s;allads, roots,
<PB N="4" REF="6">
and pot-herbs, my own garden yields in
plenty and perfection; the produce of
the natural &s;oil, prepared by moderate
cultivation. The &s;ame &s;oil affords all
the different fruits which England may
call her own, &s;o that my de&s;ert is every
day fre&s;h-gathered from the tree; my
dairy flows with nectarious tides of milk
and cream, from whence we derive abun|dance
of excellent butter, curds, and
chee&s;e; and the refu&s;e fattens my pigs,
that are de&s;tined for hams and bacon&mdash;I
go to bed betimes, and ri&s;e with the &s;un
&mdash;I make &s;hift to pa&s;s the hours without
wearine&s;s or regret, and am not de&s;titute
of amu&s;ements within doors, when the
weather will not permit me to go abroad
&mdash;I read, and chat, and play at billiards,
cards, or back-gammon&mdash;Without doors,
I &s;uperintend my farm, and execute plans
of improvement, the effects of which I
enjoy with un&s;peakable delight&mdash;Nor do
I take le&s;s plea&s;ure in &s;eeing my tenants
thrive under my au&s;pices, and the poor
live comfortably by the employment
which I provide&mdash;You know I have one
or two &s;en&s;ible friends, to whom I can
open all my heart; a ble&s;&s;ing which, per|haps,
I might have &s;ought in vain among
the crowded &s;cenes of life: there are a
<PB N="5" REF="7">
few others of more humble parts, whom
I e&s;teem for their integrity; and their
conver&s;ation I find inoffen&s;ive, though
not very entertaining. Finally, I live in
the mid&s;t of hone&s;t men, and tru&s;ty de|pendants,
who, I flatter my&s;elf, have a
di&s;intere&s;ted attachment to my per&s;on&mdash;
You, your&s;elf, my dear Doctor, can
vouch for the truth of the&s;e a&s;&s;er|tions.</P>
<P>Now, mark the contra&s;t at London&mdash;
I am pent up in frowzy lodgings, where
there is not room enough to &s;wing a cat;
and I breathe the &s;teams of endle&s;s pu|trefaction;
and the&s;e would, undoubtedly,
produce a pe&s;tilence, if they were not
qualified by the gro&s;s acid of &s;ea-coal,
which is it&s;elf a pernicious nui&s;ance to
lungs of any delicacy of texture: but
even this boa&s;ted corrector cannot pre|vent
tho&s;e languid, &s;allow looks, that
di&s;tingui&s;h the inhabitants of London
from tho&s;e ruddy &s;wains that lead a coun|try-life
&mdash;I go to bed after mid-night,
jaded and re&s;tle&s;s from the di&s;&s;ipations of
the day&mdash;I &s;tart every hour from my
&s;leep, at the horrid noi&s;e of the watch|men
bawling the hour through every
&s;treet, and thundering at every door; a
&s;et of u&s;ele&s;s fellows, who &s;erve no other
<PB N="6" REF="8">
purpo&s;e but that of di&s;turbing the repo&s;e
of the inhabitants; and by five o'clock I
&s;tart out of bed, in con&s;equence of the
&s;till more dreadful alarm made by the
country ca$ts, and noi&s;y ru&s;tics bellow|ing
green pea&s;e under my window. If I
would drink water, I mu&s;t quaff the
mauki&s;h contents of an open aqueduct,
expo&s;ed to all manner of defilement; or
&s;wallow that which comes from the river
Thames, impregnated with all the filth
of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter&mdash;Human
excrement is the lea&s;t offen&s;ive part of the
concrete, which is compo&s;ed of all the
drugs, minerals, and poi&s;ons, u&s;ed in me|chanics
and manufacture, enriched with
the putrefying carca&s;es of bea&s;ts and men;
and mixed with the &s;courings of all the
wa&s;h-tubs, kennels, and common &s;ewers,
within the bills of mortality.</P>
<P>This is the agreeable potation, extolled
by the Londoners, as the fine&s;t water in
the univer&s;e&mdash;As to the intoxicating po|tion,
&s;old for wine, it is a vile, unpalat|able,
and pernicious &s;ophi&s;tication, bal|derda&s;hed
with cyder, corn &s;pirit, and the
juice of &s;loes. In an action at law, laid
again&s;t a carman for having &s;taved a
ca&s;k of port, it appeared from the evi|dence
of the cooper, that there were not
<PB N="7" REF="9">
above five gallons of real wine in the
whole pipe, which held above a hundred,
and even that had been brewed and adul|terated
by the merchant at Oporto. The
bread I eat in London, is a deleterious
pa&s;te, mixed up with chalk, alum, and
bone-a&s;hes; in&s;ipid to the ta&s;te, and de|&s;tructive
to the con&s;titution. The good
people are not ignorant of this adultera|tion;
but they prefer it to whol&s;ome
bread, becau&s;e it is whiter than the meal
of corn: thus they &s;acrifice their ta&s;te and
their health, and the lives of their tender
infants, to a mo&s;t ab&s;urd gratification of
a mi&s;-judging eye; and the miller, or the
baker, is obliged to poi&s;on them and their
families, in order to live by his profe&s;|&s;ion.
The &s;ame mon&s;trous depravity ap|pears
in their veal, which is bleached by
repeated bleedings, and other villanous
arts, till there is not a drop of juice left
in the body, and the poor animal is pa|ralytic
before it dies; &s;o void of all ta&s;te,
nouri&s;hment, and &s;avour, that a man
might dine as comfortably on a white
frica&s;ee of kid-&s;kin gloves, or chip hats
from Leghorn.</P>
<P>As they have di&s;charged the natural
colour from their bread, their butchers|meat,
and poultry, their cutlets, ragouts,
<PB N="8" REF="10">
frica&s;&s;ees, and &s;auces of all kinds; &s;o
they in&s;i&s;t upon having the complexion of
their pot-herbs mended, even at the
hazard of their lives. Perhaps, you will
hardly believe they can be &s;o mad as to
boil their greens with bra&s;s half-pence, in
order to improve their colour; and yet
nothing is more true&mdash;Indeed, without
this improvement in the colour, they have
no per&s;onal merit. They are produced in
an artificial &s;oil, and ta&s;te of nothing but
the dunghills, from whence they &s;pring.
My cabbage, cauliflower, and '&s;paragus
in the country, are as much &s;uperior in
flavour to tho&s;e that are &s;old in Covent|garden,
as my heath-mutton is to that of
St. James's-market; which, in fact, is
neither lamb nor mutton, but &s;omething
betwixt the two, gorged in the rank fens
of Lincoln and E&s;&s;ex, pale, coar&s;e, and
frowzy&mdash;As for the pork, it is an abomi|nable
carnivorous animal, fed with hor&s;e|fle&s;h
and di&s;tillers grains; and the poul|try
is all rotten, in con&s;equence of a fever,
occa&s;ioned by the infamous practice of
&s;ewing up the gut, that they may be
the &s;ooner fattened in coops, in con&s;e|quence
of this cruel retention.</P>
<P>Of the fi&s;h, I need &s;ay nothing in this
hot weather, but that it comes &s;ixty, &s;e|venty,
<PB N="9" REF="11">
four&s;core, and a hundred miles
by land-carriage; a circum&s;tance &s;uffi|cient,
without any comment, to turn a
Dutchman's &s;tomach, even if his no&s;e was
not &s;aluted in every alley with the &s;weet
flavour of <HI>fre&s;h</HI> mackarel, &s;elling by re|tail
&mdash;This is not the &s;ea&s;on for oy&s;ters;
neverthele&s;s, it may not be ami&s;s to men|tion,
that the right Colche&s;ter are kept
in &s;lime-pits, occa&s;ionally overflowed by
the &s;ea; and that the green colour, &s;o
much admired by the voluptuaries of this
metropolis, is occa&s;ioned by the vitriolic
&s;cum, which ri&s;es on the &s;urface of the
&s;tagnant and &s;tinking water&mdash;Our rab|bits
are bred and fed in the poulterer's
cellar, where they have neither air nor
exerci&s;e, con&s;equently they mu&s;t be firm
in fle&s;h, and delicious in flavour; and
there is no game to be had for love or
money.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be owned, that Covent-garden
affords &s;ome good fruit; which, how|ever,
is always engro&s;&s;ed by a few indi|viduals
of over-grown fortune, at an ex|orbitant
price; &s;o that little el&s;e than the
refu&s;e of the market falls to the &s;hare of
the community; and that is di&s;tributed by
&s;uch filthy hands, as I cannot look at
without loathing. It was but ye&s;terday
<PB N="10" REF="12">
that I &s;aw a dirty barrow-bunter in the
&s;treet, cleaning her du&s;ty fruit with her
own &s;pittle; and, who knows but &s;ome
fine lady of St. James's pari&s;h might ad|mit
into her delicate mouth tho&s;e very
cherries, which had been rolled and
moi&s;tened between the filthy, and, per|haps,
ulcerated chops of a St. Giles's
huck&s;ter&mdash;I need not dwell upon the pal|lid,
contaminated ma&s;h, which they call
&s;trawberries; &s;oiled and to&s;&s;ed by grea&s;y
paws through twenty ba&s;kets cru&s;ted
with dirt; and then pre&s;ented with the
wor&s;t milk, thickened with the wor&s;t
flour, into a bad likene&s;s of cream: but
the milk it&s;elf &s;hould not pa&s;s unanaly&s;ed,
the produce of faded cabbage-leaves and
&s;our draff, lowered with hot water, froth|ed
with brui&s;ed &s;nails, carried through the
&s;treets in open pails, expo&s;ed to foul
rin&s;ings, di&s;charged from doors and win|dows,
&s;pittle, &s;not, and tobacco-quids
from foot-pa&s;&s;engers, over-flowings from
mud-carts, &s;patterings from coach-wheels,
dirt and tra&s;h chucked into it by rogui&s;h
boys for the joke's-&s;ake, the &s;pewings of
infants, who have &s;labbered in the tin|mea&s;ure,
which is thrown back in that
condition among the milk, for the bene|fit
of the next cu&s;tomer; and, finally,
<PB N="11" REF="13">
the vermin that drops from the rags of
the na&s;ty drab that vends this precious
mixture, under the re&s;pectable denomi|nation
of milk-maid.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this catalogue of Lon|don
dainties, with that table-beer, guilt|le&s;s
of hops and malt, vapid and nau|&s;eous;
much fitter to facilitate the opera|tion
of a vomit, than to quench thir&s;t and
promote dige&s;tion; the tallowy rancid
ma&s;s, called butter, manufactured with
candle-grea&s;e and kitchen-&s;tuff; and their
fre&s;h eggs, imported from France and
Scotland.&mdash;Now, all the&s;e enormities
might be remedied with a very little at|tention
to the article of police, or civil
regulation; but the wi&s;e patriots of Lon|don
have taken it into their heads, that
all regulation is incon&s;i&s;tent with liberty;
and that every man ought to live in his
own way, without re&s;traint&mdash;Nay, as
there is not &s;en&s;e enough left among
them, to be di&s;compo&s;ed by the nui&s;ances
I have mentioned, they may, for aught
I care, wallow in the mire of their own
pollution.</P>
<P>A companionable man will, undoubt|edly,
put up with many inconveniences
for the &s;ake of enjoying agreeable &s;ociety.
A facetious friend of mine u&s;ed to &s;ay,
the wine could not be bad, where the
<PB N="12" REF="14">
company was agreeable; a maxim which,
however, ought to be taken <HI>cum grano &s;a|lis:</HI>
but what is the &s;ociety of London,
that I &s;hould be tempted, for its &s;ake, to
mortify my &s;en&s;es, and compound with
&s;uch uncleanne&s;s as my &s;oul abhors? All
the people I &s;ee, are too much engro&s;&s;ed
by &s;chemes of intere&s;t or ambition, to
have any room left for &s;entiment or
friend&s;hip&mdash;Even in &s;ome of my old ac|quaintance,
tho&s;e &s;chemes and pur&s;uits,
have obliterated all traces of our former
connexion&mdash;Conver&s;ation is reduced to
party-di&s;putes, and illiberal altercation&mdash;
Social commerce, to formal vi$its and
card-playing&mdash;If you pick up a diverting
original by accident, it may be dangerous
to amu&s;e your&s;elf with his oddities&mdash;He
is generally a tartar at bottom; a &s;harper,
a &s;py, or a lunatic. Every per&s;on you
deal with endeavours to over-reach you
in the way of bu&s;ine&s;s; you are preyed
upon by idle mendicants, who beg in the
phra&s;e of borrowing, and live upon the
&s;poils of the &s;tranger&mdash;Your trade&s;men
are without con&s;cience, your friends with|out
affection, and your dependants without
fidelity.&mdash;</P>
<P>My letter would &s;well into a treati&s;e,

that fills up the mea&s;ure of my

city&mdash;Thank Heaven! I am not &s;o far
&s;ucked into the vortex, but that I can

of philo&s;ophy&mdash;From this wild uproar of
knavery, folly, and impertinence, I &s;hall
fly with double reli&s;h to the &s;erenity of re|tirement,
the cordial effu&s;ions of unre|&s;erved

any con&s;iderable halt, as often as any
thing occurs, which I think can afford
you the lea&s;t amu&s;ement. In the mean

<PB N="14" REF="16">
<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bar^t. of
Je&s;us college, Oxon.
DEAR PHILLIPS,</OPENER>
<P>IN my la&s;t, I mentioned my having
&s;pent an evening with a &s;ociety of authors,
who &s;eemed to be jealous and afraid of
one another. My uncle was not at all
&s;urpri&s;ed to hear me &s;ay I was di&s;appoint|ed
in their conver&s;ation. &startq;A man may
be very entertaining and in&s;tructive
upon paper, (&s;aid he) and exceedingly
dull in common di&s;cour&s;e. I have ob|&s;erved,
that tho&s;e who &s;hine mo&s;t in
private company, are but &s;econdary
&s;tars in the con&s;tellation of genius&mdash;A
&s;mall &s;tock of ideas is more ea&s;ily ma|naged,
and &s;ooner di&s;played, than a
great quantity crowded together. There
is very &s;eldom any thing extraordinary
in the appearance and addre&s;s of a good
writer; whereas a dull author generally
di&s;tingui&s;hes him&s;elf by &s;ome oddity or
extravagance. For this rea&s;on, I fancy,
<PB N="15" REF="17">
an a&s;&s;embly of Grubs mu&s;t be very di|verting.&endq;</P>
<P>My curio&s;ity being excited by this hint,
I con&s;ulted my friend Dick Ivy, who un|dertook
to gratify it the very next day,
which was Sunday la&s;t.&mdash;He carried me
to dine with S&mdash;, whom you and I have
long known by his writings.&mdash;He lives in
the &s;kirts of the town, and every Sunday
his hou&s;e is open to all unfortunate bro|thers
of the quill, whom he treats with
beef, pudding, and potatoes, port, punch,
and Calvert's entire butt beer.&mdash;He has
fixed upon the fir&s;t day of the week for
the exerci&s;e of his ho&s;pitality, becau&s;e
&s;ome of his gue&s;ts could not enjoy it on
any other, for rea&s;ons that I need not ex|plain.
I was civilly received in a plain, yet
decent habitation, which opened backwards
into a very plea&s;ant garden, kept in excel|lent
order; and, indeed, I &s;aw none of the
outward &s;igns of author&s;hip, either in the
hou&s;e or the landlord, who is one of tho&s;e
few writers of the age that &s;tand upon
their own foundation, without patronage,
and above dependence. If there was no|thing
characteri&s;tic in the entertainer, the
company made ample amends for his
want of &s;ingularity.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="18">
At two in the afternoon, I found my|&s;elf
one of ten me&s;s-mates &s;eated at table;
and, I que&s;tion, if the whole kingdom
could produce &s;uch another a&s;&s;emblage of
originals. Among their peculiarities, I do
not mention tho&s;e of dre&s;s, which may be
purely accidental. What &s;truck me were
oddities originally produced by affecta|tion,
and afterwards confirmed by habit.
One of them wore &s;pectacles at dinner,
and another, his hat flapped; though (as
Ivy told me) the fir&s;t was noted for hav|ing
a &s;eaman's eye, when a bailiff was in
the wind; and the other was never known
to labour under any weakne&s;s or defect of
vi&s;ion, except about five years ago, when
he was complimented with a couple of
black eyes by a player, with whom he
had quarrelled in his drink. A third
wore a laced &s;tocking, and made u&s;e of
crutches, becau&s;e, once in his life, he
had been laid up with a broken leg,
though no man could leap over a &s;tick
with more agility. A fourth had con|tracted
&s;uch an antipathy to the country,
that he in&s;i&s;ted upon &s;itting with his back
towards the window that looked into the
garden, and when a di&s;h of cauliflower
was &s;et upon the table, he &s;nuffed up vo|latile
<PB N="17" REF="19">
&s;alts to keep him from fainting;
yet this delicate per&s;on was the &s;on of a
cottager, born under a hedge, and had
many years run wild among a&s;&s;es on a
common. A fifth affected di&s;traction&mdash;
When &s;poke to, he always an&s;wered from
the purpo&s;e&mdash;&s;ometimes he &s;uddenly &s;tart|ed
up, and rapped out a dreadful oath&mdash;
&s;ometimes he bur&s;t out a-laughing&mdash;then
he folded his arms, and &s;ighed&mdash;and then
he hi&s;&s;ed like fifty &s;erpents.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t, I really thought he was mad,
and, as he &s;at near me, began to be under
&s;ome apprehen&s;ions for my own &s;afety,
when our landlord, perceiving me alarm|ed,
a&s;&s;ured me aloud that I had nothing
to fear. &startq;The gentleman (&s;aid he) is
trying to act a part, for which he is by
no means qualified&mdash;if he had all the
inclination in the world, it is not in his
power to be mad. His &s;pirits are too
flat to be kindled into frenzy.&endq; &startq;'Tis
no bad p-p-puff, how-ow-ever (ob&s;erv|ed
a per&s;on in a tarni&s;hed laced coat):
aff-ffected m-madne&s;s w-will p-pa&s;s for
w-wit w-with nine-ninet-teen out of
t-twenty.&endq;&mdash;&startq;And affected &s;tuttering
for humour: replied our landlord, tho',
God knows, there is no affinity betwixt
them.&endq; It &s;eems, this wag, after hav|ing
<PB N="18" REF="20">
made &s;ome abortive attempts in
plain &s;peaking, had recour&s;e to this de|fect,
by means of which he frequently ex|torted
the laugh of the company, without
the lea&s;t expence of genius; and that im|perfection,
which he had at fir&s;t counter|feited,
was now become &s;o habitual, that
he could not lay it a&s;ide.</P>
<P>A certain winking genius, who wore
yellow gloves at dinner, had, on his fir&s;t
introduction, taken &s;uch offence at S&mdash;,
becau&s;e he looked and talked, and ate
and drank like any other man, that he
&s;poke contemptuou&s;ly of his under&s;tand|ing
ever after, and never would repeat
his vi&s;it, until he had exhibited the fol|lowing
proof of his caprice. Wat Wyvil,
the poet, having made &s;ome un&s;ucce&s;sful
advances towards an intimacy with S&mdash;,
at la&s;t gave him to under&s;tand, by a third
per&s;on, that he had written a poem in his
prai&s;e, and a &s;atire again&s;t his per&s;on;
that if he would admit him to his hou&s;e,
the fir&s;t &s;hould be immediately &s;ent to
pre&s;s; but that if he per&s;i&s;ted in declining
his friend&s;hip, he would publi&s;h the &s;atire
without delay. S&mdash;replied, that he
looked upon Wyvil's panegyrick, as in
effect, a &s;pecies of infamy, and would re|&s;ent
it accordingly with a good cudgel;
<PB N="19" REF="21">
but if he publi&s;hed the &s;atire, he might
de&s;erve his compa&s;&s;ion, and had nothing
to fear from his revenge. Wyvil having
con&s;idered the alternative, re&s;olved to
mortify S&mdash;by printing the panegyrick,
for which he received a &s;ound drubbing.
Then he &s;wore the peace again&s;t the ag|gre&s;&s;or,
who, in order to avoid a pro&s;e|cution
at law, admitted him to his good
graces. It was the &s;ingularity in S&mdash;'s
conduct on this occa&s;ion, that reconciled
him to the yellow-gloved philo&s;opher,
who owned he had &s;ome genius, and
from that period cultivated his acquain|tance.</P>
<P>Curious to know upon what &s;ubjects
the &s;everal talents of my fellow-gue&s;ts
were employed, I applied to my commu|nicative
friend Dick Ivy, who gave me to
under&s;tand, that mo&s;t of them were, or
had been, under&s;trappers, or journeymen,
to more creditable authors, for whom
they tran&s;lated, collated, and compiled,
in the bu&s;ine&s;s of book-making; and that
all of them had, at different times, la|boured
in the &s;ervice of our landlord,
though they had now &s;et up for them|&s;elves
in various departments of literature.
Not only their talents, but al&s;o their na|tions
and dialects were &s;o various, that
<PB N="20" REF="22">
our conver&s;ation re&s;embled the confu&s;ion
of tongues at Babel. We had the Iri&s;h
brogue, the Scotch accent, and foreign
idiom, twanged off by the mo&s;t di&s;cor|dant
vociferation; for, as they all &s;poke
together, no man had any chance to be
heard, unle&s;s he could bawl louder than
his fellows. It mu&s;t be owned, however,
there was nothing pedantic in their di&s;|cour&s;e;
they carefully avoided all learn|ed
di&s;qui&s;itions, and endeavoured to be
facetious; nor did their endeavours al|ways
mi&s;carry&mdash;&s;ome droll repartee
pa&s;&s;ed, and much laughter was excited;
and if any individual lo&s;t his temper &s;o
far as to tran&s;gre&s;s the bounds of deco|rum,
he was effectually checked by the
ma&s;ter of the fea&s;t, who exerted a &s;ort of
paternal authority over this irritable
tribe.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t learned philo&s;opher of the
whole collection, who had been expelled
the univer&s;ity for athei&s;m, has made great
progre&s;s in a refutation of lord Boling|broke's
metaphy&s;ical works, which is &s;aid
to be equally ingenious and orthodox;
but, in the mean time, he has been pre|&s;ented
to the grand jury as a public nui|&s;ance,
for having bla&s;phemed in an ale|hou&s;e
on the Lord's day. The Scotch|man
<PB N="21" REF="23">
gives lectures on the pronunciation
of the Engli&s;h language, which he is now
publi&s;hing by &s;ub&s;cription.</P>
<P>The Iri&s;hman is a political writer, and
goes by the name of my Lord Potatoe.
He wrote a pamphlet in vindication of a
mini&s;ter, hoping his zeal would be re|warded
with &s;ome place or pen&s;ion; but
finding him&s;elf neglected in that quarter,
he whi&s;pered about, that the pamphlet
was written by the mini&s;ter him&s;elf, and
he publi&s;hed an an&s;wer to his own pro|duction.
In this, he addre&s;&s;ed the author
under the title of <HI>your lord&s;hip</HI> with &s;uch
&s;olemnity, that the public &s;wallowed the
deceit, and bought up the whole impre&s;|&s;ion.
The wi&s;e politicians of the metro|polis
declared they were both ma&s;terly
performances, and chuckled over the
flim&s;y reveries of an ignorant garretteer,
as the profound &s;peculations of a veteran
&s;tate&s;man, acquainted with all the &s;ecrets
of the cabinet. The impo&s;ture was detect|ed
in the &s;equel, and our Hibernian pam|phleteer
retains no part of his a&s;&s;umed
importance, but the bare title of <HI>my lord,</HI>
and the upper part of the table at the po|tatoe-ordinary
in Shoe-lane.</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ite to me &s;at a Piedmonte&s;e, who
had obliged the public with a humorous
<PB N="22" REF="24">
&s;atire, intituled, <HI>The Balance of the Engli&s;h
Poets,</HI> a performance which evinced the
great mode&s;ty and ta&s;te of the author,
and, in particular, his intimacy with the
elegancies of the Engli&s;h language. The
&s;age, who laboured under the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">,
or <HI>horror of green fields,</HI> had ju&s;t fini&s;hed a
treati&s;e on practical agriculture, though,
in fact, he had never &s;een corn growing in
his life, and was &s;o ignorant of grain, that
our entertainer, in the face of the whole
company, made him own, that a plate of
hominy was the be&s;t rice pudding he had
ever eat.</P>
<P>The &s;tutterer had almo&s;t fini&s;hed his
travels through Europe and part of A&s;ia,
without ever budging beyond the liberties
of the King's Bench, except in term-time,
with a tip&s;taff for his companion; and as
for little Tim Cropdale, the mo&s;t face|tious
member of the whole &s;ociety, he
had happily wound up the cata&s;trophe of
a virgin tragedy, from the exhibition of
which he promi&s;ed him&s;elf a large fund
of profit and reputation. Tim had made
&s;hift to live many years by writing novels,
at the rate of five pounds a volume; but
that branch of bu&s;ine&s;s is now engro&s;&s;ed
by female authors, who publi&s;h merely
for the propagation of virtue, with &s;o
<PB N="23" REF="25">
much ea&s;e and &s;pirit, and delicacy, and
knowledge of the human heart, and all
in the &s;erene tranquillity of high life, that
the reader is not only inchanted by their
genius, but reformed by their morality.</P>
<P>After dinner, we adjourned into the
garden, where, I ob&s;erved, Mr. S&mdash;
gave a &s;hort &s;eparate audience to every in|dividual
in a &s;mall remote filbert walk,
from whence mo&s;t of them dropt off
one after another, without further cere|mony;
but they were replaced by fre&s;h
recruits of the &s;ame clan, who came to
make an afternoon's vi&s;it; and, among
other's, a &s;pruce book&s;eller, called Bir|kin,
who rode his own gelding, and made
his appearance in a pair of new jemmy
boots, with ma&s;&s;y &s;purs of plate. It was
not without rea&s;on, that this midwife of
the Mu&s;es u&s;ed exerci&s;e a-hor&s;eback, for
he was too fat to walk a-foot, and he un|derwent
&s;ome &s;arca&s;ms from Tim Crop|dale,
on his unweildy &s;ize and inaptitude
for motion. Birkin, who took umbrage
at this poor author's petulance in pre&s;um|ing
to joke upon a man &s;o much richer
than him&s;elf, told him, he was not &s;o un|weildy
but that he could move the Mar|&s;hal&s;ea
court for a writ, and even overtake
him with it, if he did not very &s;peedily
<PB N="24" REF="26">
come and &s;ettle accounts with him, re|&s;pecting
the expence of publi&s;hing his la&s;t
Ode to the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, of which he
had &s;old but three, and one of them was
to Whitefield the methodi&s;t. Tim affect|ed
to receive this intimation with good
humour, &s;aying, he expected in a po&s;t or
two, from Pot&s;dam, a poem of thanks
from his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty, who knew very
well how to pay poets in their own coin;
but, in the mean time, he propo&s;ed, that
Mr. Birkin and he &s;hould run three times
round the garden for a bowl of punch, to
be drank at A&s;hley's in the evening, and
he would run boots again&s;t &s;tockings.
The book&s;eller, who valued him&s;elf upon
his mettle, was per&s;uaded to accept the
challenge, and he forthwith re&s;igned his
boots to Cropdale, who, when he bad
put them on, was no bad repre&s;entation
of captain Pi&s;tol in the play.</P>
<P>Every thing being adju&s;ted, they &s;tart|ed
together with great impetuo&s;ity, and,
in the &s;econd round, Birkin had clearly
the advantage, <HI>larding the lean earth as he
puff'd along.</HI> Cropdale had no mind to
conte&s;t the victory further; but, in a
twinkling, di&s;appeared through the back|door
of the garden, which opened into a
private lane, that had communication
<PB N="25" REF="27">
with the high road.&mdash;The &s;pectators im|mediately
began to hollow, &startq;Stole away!&endq;
and Birkin &s;et off in pur&s;uit of him with
great eagerne&s;s; but he had not advanced
twenty yards in the lane, when a thorn
running into his foot, &s;ent him hopping
back into the garden, roaring with pain,
and &s;wearing with vexation. When he
was delivered from this annoyance by the
Scotchman, who had been bred to &s;urge|ry,
he looked about him wildly, exclaim|ing,
&startq;Sure, the fellow won't be &s;uch a
rogue as to run clear away with my
boots!&endq; Our landlord, having recon|noitred
the &s;hoes he had left, which, in|deed,
hardly de&s;erved that name, &startq;Pray,
(&s;aid he) Mr. Birkin, wa'n't your boots
made of calf-&s;kin?&endq; &startq;Claf-&s;kin or
cow-&s;kin, (replied the other) I'll find a
&s;lip of &s;heep-&s;kin that will do his bu&s;i|ne&s;s
&mdash;I lo&s;t twenty pounds by his farce,
which you per&s;uaded me to buy&mdash;I am
out of pocket five pounds by his damn'd
ode; and now this pair of boots, bran
new, co&s;t me thirty &s;hillings, as per re|ceipt.
&mdash;But this affair of the boots is
felony&mdash;tran&s;portation.&mdash;I'll have the
dog indicted at the Old Bailey&mdash;I will,
Mr. S&mdash;. I will be reveng'd, even
<PB N="26" REF="28">
though I &s;hould lo&s;e my debt in con|&s;equence
of his conviction.&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. S&mdash;&s;aid nothing at pre&s;ent, but
accommodated him with a pair of &s;hoes;
then ordered his &s;ervant to rub him down,
and comfort him with a gla&s;s of rum|punch,
which &s;eemed, in a great mea&s;ure,
to cool the rage of his indignation. &startq;Af|ter
all, (&s;aid our landlord) this is no
more than a <HI>humbug</HI> in the way of wit,
though it de&s;erves a more re&s;pectable
epithet, when con&s;idered as an effort of
invention. Tim, being (I &s;uppo&s;e) out
of credit with the cordwainer, fell upon
this ingenious expedient to &s;upply the
want of &s;hoes, knowing that Mr. Bir|kin,
who loves humour, would him|&s;elf
reli&s;h the joke upon a little recol|lection.
Cropdale literally lives by his
wit, which he has exerci&s;ed upon all his
friends in their turns. He once bor|rowed
my poney for five or &s;ix days to
go to Sali&s;bury, and &s;old him in Smith|field
at his return. This was a joke of
&s;uch a &s;erious nature, that, in the fir&s;t
tran&s;ports of my pa&s;&s;ion, I had &s;ome
thoughts of pro&s;ecuting him for hor&s;e|&s;tealing;
and even when my re&s;ent|ment
had in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;ub&s;ided, as
<PB N="27" REF="29">
he indu&s;triou&s;ly avoided me, I vowed, I
would take &s;atisfaction on his ribs with
the fir&s;t opportunity. One day, &s;eeing
him at &s;ome di&s;tance in the &s;treet, coming
towards me, I began to prepare my cane
for action, and walked in the &s;hadow of
a porter, that he might not perceive me
&s;oon enough to make his e&s;cape; but,
in the very in&s;tant I had lifted up the
in&s;trument of correction, I found Tim
Cropdale metamorpho&s;ed into a mi&s;er|able
blind wretch, feeling his way with a
long &s;tick from po&s;t to po&s;t, and roll|ing
about two bald unlighted orbs in|&s;tead
of eyes. I was exceedingly &s;hocked
at having &s;o narrowly e&s;caped the con|cern
and di&s;grace that would have at|tended
&s;uch a mi&s;application of ven|geance:
but, next day, Tim prevailed
upon a friend of mine to come and &s;ol|licit
my forgivene&s;s, and offer his note,
payable in &s;ix weeks, for the price of
the poney.&mdash;This gentleman gave me
to under&s;tand, that the blind man was
no other than Cropdale, who having
&s;een me advancing, and gue&s;&s;ing my
intent, had immediately converted him|&s;elf
into the object afore&s;aid.&mdash;I was &s;o
diverted at the ingenuity of the eva&s;ion,
that I agreed to pardon his offence, re|fu&s;ing
<PB N="28" REF="30">
his note, however, that I might
keep a pro&s;ecution for felony hanging
over his head, as a &s;ecurity for his fu|ture
good behaviour&mdash;But Timothy
would by no means tru&s;t him&s;elf in my
hands till the note was accepted&mdash;then
he made his appearance at my door as
a blind beggar, and impo&s;ed in &s;uch a
manner upon my man, who had been
his old acquaintance and pot-compa|nion,
that the fellow threw the door in
his face, and even threatened to give
him the ba&s;tinado. Hearing a noi&s;e in
the hall, I went thither, and imme|diately
recollecting the figure I had
pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;treet, acco&s;ted him by his
own name, to the un&s;peakable a&s;toni&s;h|ment
of the footmans.&endq;</P>
<P>Birkin declared he loved a joke as well
as another; but a&s;ked if any of the com|pany
could tell where Mr. Cropdale
lodged, that he might &s;end him a propo|&s;al
about re&s;titution, before the boots
&s;hould be made away with. &startq;I would
willingly give him a pair of new &s;hoes,
(&s;aid he) and half a guinea into the bar|gain,
for the boots, which fitted me
like a glove; and I &s;han't be able to
get the follows of them till the good
weather for riding is over.&endq; The &s;tut|tering
<PB N="29" REF="31">
wit declared, that the only &s;ecret
which Cropdale ever kept, was the place
of his lodgings; but, be believed, that,
during the heats of &s;ummer, he common|ly
took his repo&s;e upon a bulk, or indul|ged
him&s;elf, in fre&s;co, with one of the
kennel-nymphs, under the portico of St.
Martin's church. &startq;Pox on him! (cried
the book&s;eller) he might as well have
taken my whip and &s;purs&mdash;In that ca&s;e,
he might have been tempted to &s;teal
another hor&s;e, and then he would have
rid to the devil of cour&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>After coffee, I took my leave of Mr.
S&mdash;, with proper acknowledgements
of his civility, and was extremely well
plea&s;ed with the entertainment of the day,
though not yet &s;atisfied, with re&s;pect to
the nature of this connexion, betwixt a
man of character in the literary world, and
a parcel of authorlings, who, in all pro|bability,
would never be able to acquire
any degree of reputation by their labours.
On this head I interrogated my conductor,
Dick Ivy, who an&s;wered to this effect&mdash;
&startq;One would imagine S&mdash;had &s;ome view
to his own intere&s;t, in giving countenance
and a&s;&s;i&s;tance to tho&s;e people, whom he
knows to be bad men, as well as bad
writers; but, if he has any &s;uch view,
<PB N="30" REF="32">
he will find him&s;elf di&s;appointed; for
if he is &s;o vain as to imagine he can
make them &s;ub&s;ervient to his &s;chemes
of profit or ambition, they are cun|ning
enough to make him their proper|ty
in the mean time. There is not one
of the company you have &s;een to-day
(my&s;elf excepted) who does not owe
him particular obligations.&mdash;One of
them he bailed out of a &s;punging-hou&s;e,
and afterwards paid the debt&mdash;another
he tran&s;lated into his family, and cloath|ed,
when he was turned out half naked
from jail in con&s;equence of an act for
the relief of in&s;olvent debtors&mdash;a third,
who was reduced to a woollen night|cap,
and lived upon &s;heeps trotters, up
three pair of &s;tairs backward in But|cher-row,
he took into pre&s;ent pay and
free quarters, and enabled him to ap|pear
as a gentleman, without having
the fear of &s;heriff's officers before his
eyes. Tho&s;e who are in di&s;tre&s;s he
&s;upplies with money when he has it,
and with his credit when he is out of
ca&s;h. When they want bu&s;ine&s;s, he
either finds employment for them in his
own &s;ervice, or recommends them to
book&s;ellers to execute &s;ome project he
has formed for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. They
<PB N="31" REF="33">
are always welcome to his table, (which,
though plain, is plentiful) and to his
good offices as far as they will go; and
when they &s;ee occa&s;ion, they make u&s;e
of his name with the mo&s;t petulant fa|miliarity;
nay, they do not even &s;cruple
to arrogate to them&s;elves the merit of
&s;ome of his performances, and have been
known to &s;ell their own lucubrations as
the produce of his brain. The Scotch|man
you &s;aw at dinner once per&s;onated
him at an ale-hou&s;e in We&s;t-Smithfield,
and, in the character of S&mdash;, had
his head broke by a cow-keeper, for
having &s;poke di&s;re&s;pectfully of the
Chri&s;tian religion; but he took the
law of him in his own per&s;on, and the
a&s;&s;ailant was fain to give him ten
pounds to withdraw his action.&endq;</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved, that all this appearance of
liberality on the &s;ide of Mr. S&mdash;was
ea&s;ily accounted for, on the &s;uppo&s;ition
that they flattered him in private, and en|gaged
his adver&s;aries in public; and yet I
was a&s;toni&s;hed, when I recollected that I
often had &s;een this writer virulently abu&s;ed
in papers, poems, and pamphlets, and not
a pen was drawn in his defence.&mdash;&startq;But
you will be more a&s;toni&s;hed (&s;aid he)
when I a&s;&s;ure you, tho&s;e very gue&s;ts
<PB N="32" REF="34">
whom you &s;aw at his table to-day, were
the authors of great part of that abu&s;e;
and he him&s;elf is well aware of their
particular favours, for they are all
eager to detect and betray one ano|ther.&endq;
&mdash;&startq;But this is doing the devil's
work for nothing (cried I). What
&s;hould induce them to revile their bene|factor
without provocation?&endq; &startq;Envy
(an&s;wered Dick) is the general incite|ment;
but they are galled by an addi|tional
&s;courge of provocation. S&mdash;
directs a literary journal, in which their
productions are nece&s;&s;arily brought to
trial; and though many of them have
been treated with &s;uch lenity and fa|vour
as they little de&s;erved, yet the
&s;lighte&s;t cen&s;ure, &s;uch as, perhaps,
could not be avoided with any preten|&s;ions
to candour and impartiality, has
rankled in the hearts of tho&s;e authors
to &s;uch a degree, that they have taken
immediate vengeance on the critic in
anonymous libels, letters, and lam|poons.
Indeed, all the writers of the
age, good, bad, and indifferent, from
the moment he a&s;&s;umed this office,
became his enemies, either profe&s;|&s;ed
or in petto, except tho&s;e of his
friends who knew they had nothing to
<PB N="33" REF="35">
fear from his &s;trictures; and he mu&s;t be
a wi&s;er man than me, who can tell what
advantage or &s;atisfaction he derives
from having brought &s;uch a ne&s;t of
hornets about his ears.&endq;</P>
<P>I owned, that was a point which might
de&s;erve con&s;ideration; but &s;till I expre&s;&s;ed
a de&s;ire to know his real motives for con|tinuing
his friend&s;hip to a &s;et of ra&s;cals
equally ungrateful and in&s;ignificant.&mdash;He
&s;aid, he did not pretend to a&s;&s;ign any rea|&s;onable
motive; that, if the truth mu&s;t
be told, the man was, in point of conduct,
a mo&s;t incorrigible fool; that, though he
pretended to have a knack at hitting off
characters, he blundered &s;trangely in the
di&s;tribution of his favours, which were
generally be&s;towed on the mo&s;t unde&s;erv|ing
of tho&s;e who had recour&s;e to his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance;
that, indeed, this preference was
not &s;o much owing to want of di&s;cern|ment
as to want of re&s;olution, for he had
not fortitude enough to re&s;i&s;t the impor|tunity
even of the mo&s;t worthle&s;s; and,
as he did not know the value of money,
there was very little merit in parting with
it &s;o ea&s;ily; that his pride was gratified in
&s;eeing him&s;elf courted by &s;uch a number
of literary dependants; that, probably,
he delighted in hearing them expo&s;e and
<PB N="34" REF="36">
traduce one another; and, finally, from
their information, he became acquainted
with all the tran&s;actions of Grub-&s;treet,
which he had &s;ome thoughts of compiling,
for the entertainment of the public.</P>
<P>I could not help &s;u&s;pecting, from Dick's
di&s;cour&s;e, that he had &s;ome particular
grudge again&s;t S&mdash;, upon who&s;e con|duct
he had put the wor&s;t con&s;truction it
would bear; and, by dint of cro&s;s-exa|mination,
I found he was not at all &s;atis|fied
with the character which had been
given in the Review of his la&s;t perfor|mance,
though it had been treated civilly,
in con&s;equence of the author's application
to the critic. By all accounts, S&mdash;is
not without weakne&s;s and caprice; but
he is certainly good-humoured and civi|lized;
nor do I find, that there is any
thing over-bearing, cruel, or implacable
in his di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>I have dwelt &s;o long upon authors,
that you will perhaps &s;u&s;pect I intend to
enroll my&s;elf among the fraternity; but,
if I were actually qualified for the profe&s;|&s;ion,
it is at be&s;t but a de&s;perate re&s;ource
again&s;t &s;tarving, as it affords no provi&s;ion
for old age and infirmity. Salmon, at
the age of four&s;core, is now in a garret,
compiling matter, at a guinea a &s;heet for
<PB N="35" REF="37">
a modern hi&s;torian, who, in point of age,
might be his grand-child; and P&s;almo|nazar,
after having drudged half a century
in the literary mill, in all the &s;implicity and
ab&s;tinence of an A&s;iatic, &s;ub&s;i&s;ts upon the
charity of a few book&s;ellers, ju&s;t &s;ufficient
to keep him from the pari&s;h&mdash;I think
Guy, who was him&s;elf a book&s;eller,
ought to have appropriated one wing or
ward of his ho&s;pital to the u&s;e of decayed
authors; though, indeed, there is nei|ther

<LETTER>
<PB N="36" REF="38">
<OPENER>To Mi&s;s LAETITIA WILLIS, at Glouce&s;ter.
MY DEAR LETTY,</OPENER>
<P>THERE is &s;omething on my &s;pirits,
which I &s;hould not venture to communi|cate
by the po&s;t, but having the oppor|tunity
of Mrs. Brentwood's return, I &s;eize
it eagerly, to di&s;burthen my poor heart,
which is oppre&s;&s;ed with fear and vexation.
&mdash;O Letty! what a mi&s;erable &s;ituation it
is, to be without a friend to whom one
can apply for coun&s;el and con&s;olation in
di&s;tre&s;s! I hinted in my la&s;t, that one
Mr. Barton had been very particular in
his civilities: I can no longer mi&s;take his
meaning&mdash;he has formally profe&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf
my admirer; and, after a thou&s;and
a&s;&s;iduities, perceiving I made but a cold
return to his addre&s;&s;es, he had recour&s;e
to the mediation of lady Gri&s;kin, who has
acted the part of a very warm advocate in
his behalf:&mdash;but, my dear Willis, her
lady&s;hip over-acts her part&mdash;&s;he not only
expatiates on the ample fortune, the great
<PB N="37" REF="39">
connexions, and the unblemi&s;hed charac|ter
of Mr. Barton, but &s;he takes the trou|ble
to catechi&s;e me; and, two days ago,
peremptorily told me, that a girl of my
age could not po&s;&s;ibly re&s;i&s;t &s;o many con|&s;iderations,
if her heart was not pre-en|gaged.</P>
<P>This in&s;inuation threw me into &s;uch a
flutter, that &s;he could not but ob&s;erve
my di&s;order; and, pre&s;uming upon the
di&s;covery, in&s;i&s;ted upon my making her
the confidante of my pa&s;&s;ion. But, al|though
I had not &s;uch command of my|&s;elf
as to conceal the emotion of my
heart, I am not &s;uch a child as to di&s;clo&s;e
its &s;ecrets to a per&s;on who would certainly
u&s;e them to its prejudice. I told her, it
was no wonder if I was out of counte|nance
at her introducing a &s;ubject of con|ver&s;ation
&s;o un&s;uitable to my years and
inexperience; that I believed Mr. Barton
was a very worthy gentleman, and I was
much obliged to him for his good opi|nion;
but the affections were involuntary,
and mine, in particular, had as yet made
no conce&s;&s;ions in his favour. She &s;hook
her head with an air of di&s;tru&s;t that made
me tremble; and ob&s;erved, that if my af|fections
were free, they would &s;ubmit to
the deci&s;ion of prudence, e&s;pecially when
<PB N="38" REF="40">
enforced by the authority of tho&s;e who
had a right to direct my conduct. This
remark implied a de&s;ign to intere&s;t my
uncle or my aunt, perhaps my brother,
in behalf of Mr. Barton's pa&s;&s;ion; and I
am &s;adly afraid that my aunt is already
gained over. Ye&s;terday in the forenoon,
he had been walking with us in the Park,
and &s;topping in our return at a toy-&s;hop,
he pre&s;ented her with a very fine &s;nuff|box,
and me with a gold etuis, which I
re&s;olutely refu&s;ed, till &s;he commanded
me to accept it on pain of her di&s;plea|&s;ure:
neverthele&s;s, being &s;till un&s;atisfied
with re&s;pect to the propriety of receiving
this toy, I &s;ignified my doubts to my
brother, who &s;aid he would con&s;ult my
uncle on the &s;ubject, and &s;eemed to think
Mr. Barton had been rather premature in
his pre&s;ents.</P>
<P>What will be the re&s;ult of this con&s;ul|tation,
Heaven knows; but I am afraid
it will produce an explanation with Mr.
Barton, who will, no doubt, avow his
pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;ollicit their con&s;ent to a
connexion which my &s;oul abhors; for,
my deare&s;t Letty, it is not in my power to
love Mr. Barton, even if my heart was
untouched by any other tenderne&s;s. Not
that there is any thing di&s;agreeable about
<PB N="39" REF="41">
his per&s;on, but there is a total want of
that namele&s;s charm which captivates and
controuls the inchanted &s;pirit&mdash;at lea&s;t,
he appears to me to have this defect; but
if he had all the engaging qualifications
which a man can po&s;&s;e&s;s, they would be
excited in vain again&s;t that con&s;tancy,
which, I flatter my&s;elf, is the characteri&s;tic
of my nature. No, my dear Willis, I may
be involved in fre&s;h troubles, and I be|lieve
I &s;hall, from the importunities of this
gentleman and the violence of my re|lations;
but my heart is incapable of
change.</P>
<P>You know, I put no faith in dreams;
and yet I have been much di&s;turbed by
one that vi&s;ited me la&s;t night.&mdash;I thought
I was in a church, where a certain per&s;on,
whom you know, was on the point of be|ing
married to my aunt; that the clergy|man
was Mr. Barton, and that poor for|lorn
I &s;tood weeping in a corner, half
naked, and without &s;hoes or &s;tockings.&mdash;
Now, I know there is nothing &s;o childi&s;h
as to be moved by tho&s;e vain illu&s;ions;
but, neverthele&s;s, in &s;pite of all my rea|&s;on,
this hath made a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion
upon my mind, which begins to be very
gloomy. Indeed, I have another more
&s;ub&s;tantial cau&s;e of affliction&mdash;I have &s;ome
<PB N="40" REF="42">
religious &s;cruples, my dear friend, which
lie heavy on my con&s;cience.&mdash;I was per|&s;uaded
to go to the Tabernacle, where I
heard a di&s;cour&s;e that affected me deeply.
&mdash;I have prayed fervently to be enlighten|ed,
but as yet I am not &s;en&s;ible of the&s;e
inward motions, tho&s;e operations of grace,
which are the &s;igns of a regenerated &s;pirit;
and therefore I begin to be in terrible
apprehen&s;ions about the &s;tate of my poor
&s;oul. Some of our family have had very
uncommon acce&s;&s;ions, particularly my
aunt and Mrs. Jenkins, who &s;ometimes
&s;peak as if they were really in&s;pired; &s;o
that I am not like to want for either ex|hortation
or example, to purify my
thoughts, and recall them from the vani|ties
of this world, which, indeed, I would
willingly re&s;ign, if it was in my power;
but to make this &s;acrifice, I mu&s;t be en|abled

<LETTER>
<PB N="41" REF="43">
<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, of
Je&s;us college, Oxon.
DEAR PHILLIPS,</OPENER>
<P>THE moment I received your letter, I
began to execute your commi&s;&s;ion&mdash;With
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of mine ho&s;t at the Bull and
Gate, I di&s;covered the place to which
your fugitive valet had retreated, and
taxed him with his di&s;hone&s;ty&mdash;The fel|low
was in manife&s;t confu&s;ion at &s;ight of
me, but he denied the charge with great
confidence, till I told him, that if he
would give up the watch, which was a
family piece, he might keep the money
and the clothes, and go to the devil his
own way, at his lei&s;ure; but if he reject|ed
this propo&s;al, I would deliver him
forthwith to the con&s;table, whom I had
provided for that purpo&s;e, and he would
carry him before the ju&s;tice without fur|ther
delay. After &s;ome he&s;itation, he
de&s;ired to &s;peak with me in the next room,
where he produced the watch, with all
<PB N="42" REF="44">
its appendages, and I have delivered it to
our landlord, to be &s;ent you by the fir&s;t
&s;afe conveyance&mdash;So much for bu&s;i|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>I &s;hall grow vain, upon your &s;aying you
find entertainment in my letters; barren,
as they certainly are, of incident and im|portance,
becau&s;e your amu&s;ement mu&s;t
ari&s;e, not from the matter, but from the
manner, which you know is all my own
&mdash;Animated, therefore, by the approba|tion
of a per&s;on, who&s;e nice ta&s;te and
con&s;ummate judgment I can no longer
doubt, I will chearfully proceed with our
memoirs&mdash;As it is determined we &s;hall
&s;et out next week for York&s;hire, I went
to-day in the forenoon with my uncle to
&s;ee a carriage, belonging to a coach|maker
in our neighbourhood&mdash;Turning
down a narrow lane, behind Longacre,
we perceived a crowd of people &s;tanding
at a door; which, it &s;eems, opened into
a kind of a methodi&s;t meeting, and were
informed, that a footman was then hold|ing
forth to the congregation within.
Curious to &s;ee this phoenomenon, we
&s;queezed into the place with much diffi|culty;
and who &s;hould this preacher be,
but the identical Humphry Clinker. He
had fini&s;hed his &s;ermon, and given out a
<PB N="43" REF="45">
p&s;alm, the fir&s;t &s;tave of which he &s;ung
with peculiar graces&mdash;But if we were
a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee Clinker in the pulpit,
we were altogether confounded at find|ing
all the females of our family among
the audience&mdash;There was lady Gri&s;kin,
Mrs. Tabitha Bramble, Mrs. Winifred
Jenkins, my &s;i&s;ter Liddy, and Mr. Bar|ton,
and all of them joined in the p&s;al|mody,
with &s;trong marks of devotion.</P>
<P>I could hardly keep my gravity on this
ludicrous occa&s;ion; but old Square-toes
was differently affected&mdash;The fir&s;t thing
that &s;truck him, was the pre&s;umption of
his lacquey, whom he commanded to
come down, with &s;uch an air of autho|rity
as Humphry did not think proper
to di&s;regard. He de&s;cended immediate|ly,
and all the people were in commo|tion.
Barton looked exceedingly &s;heep|i&s;h,
lady Gri&s;kin flirted her fan, Mrs.
Tabby groaned in &s;pirit, Liddy changed
countenance, and Mrs. Jenkins &s;obbed
as if her heart was breaking&mdash;My uncle,
with a &s;neer, a&s;ked pardon of the ladies,
for having interrupted their devotion,
&s;aying, he had particular bu&s;ine&s;s with
the preacher, whom he ordered to call a
hackney-coach. This being immediately
brought up to the end of the lane, he
<PB N="44" REF="46">
handed Liddy into it, and my aunt and
I following him, we drove home, with|out
taking any further notice of the re&s;t
of the company, who &s;till remained in
&s;ilent a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>Mr. Bramble, perceiving Liddy in great
trepidation, a&s;&s;umed a milder a&s;pect, bid|ding
her be under no concern, for he was
not at all di&s;plea&s;ed at any thing &s;he had
done&mdash;&startq;I have no objection (&s;aid he) to
your being religiou&s;ly inclined; but I
don't think my &s;ervant is a proper
gho&s;tly director, for a devotee of your
&s;ex and character&mdash;if, in fact, (as I
rather believe) your aunt is not the &s;ole
conductre&s;s of this machine&mdash;&endq; Mrs.
Tabitha made no an&s;wer, but threw up
the whites of her eyes, as if in the act of
ejaculation&mdash;Poor Liddy &s;aid &s;he had
no right to the title of a devotee; that &s;he
thought there was no harm in hearing a
pious di&s;cour&s;e, even if it came from a
footman, e&s;pecially as her aunt was pre|&s;ent;
but that if &s;he had erred from ig|norance,
&s;he hoped he would excu&s;e it,
as &s;he could not bear the thoughts of liv|ing
under his di&s;plea&s;ure. The old gen|tleman,
pre&s;&s;ing her hand with a tender
&s;mile, &s;aid &s;he was a good girl, and that
he did not believe her capable of doing
<PB N="45" REF="47">
any thing that could give him the lea&s;t
umbrage or di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>When we arrived at our lodgings, he
commanded Mr. Clinker to attend him
up &s;tairs; and &s;poke to him in the&s;e
words&mdash;&startq;Since you are called upon by
the &s;pirit to preach and to teach, it is
high time to lay a&s;ide the livery of an
earthly ma&s;ter; and, for my part, I
am unworthy to have an apo&s;tle in my
&s;ervice&mdash;&endq; &startq;I hope (&s;aid Humphry)
I have not failed in my duty to your
honour&mdash;I &s;hould be a vile wretch if I
did, con&s;idering the mi&s;ery from which
your charity and compa&s;&s;ion relieved
me&mdash;but having an inward admonition
of the &s;pirit&mdash;&endq; &startq;An admonition
of the devil&mdash;(cried the '&s;quire, in a
pa&s;&s;ion) What admonition, you block|head?&mdash;What
right has &s;uch a fellow
as you to &s;et up for a reformer?&endq;
&startq;Begging your honour's pardon, (re|plied
Clinker) may not the new light
of God's grace &s;hine upon the poor
and the ignorant in their humility, as
well as upon the wealthy, and the phi|lo&s;opher
in all his pride of human
learning?&endq; &startq;What you imagine to be
the new light of grace, (&s;aid his ma|&s;ter)
I take to be a deceitful vapour,
<PB N="46" REF="48">
glimmering through a crack in your
upper &s;tory&mdash;In a word, Mr. Clinker,
I will have no light in my family but
what pays the king's taxes, unle&s;s it
be the light of rea&s;on, which you don't
pretend to follow.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ah, &s;ir! (cried Humphry) the light
of rea&s;on, is no more in compari&s;on to
the light I mean, than a farthing can|dle
to the &s;un at noon&mdash;&endq; &startq;Very true,
(&s;aid uncle) the one will &s;erve to &s;hew
you your way, and the other to daz|zle
and confound your weak brain&mdash;
Heark-ye, Clinker, you are either an
hypocritical knave, or a wrong-head|ed
enthu&s;ia&s;t; and, in either ca&s;e, un|fit
for my &s;ervice&mdash;If you are a quack
in &s;anctity and devotion, you will
find it an ea&s;y matter to impo&s;e upon
&s;illy women, and others of crazed un|der&s;tanding,
who will contribute la|vi&s;hly
for your &s;upport&mdash;if you are re|ally
&s;educed by the reveries of a di|&s;turbed
imagination, the &s;ooner you
lo&s;e your &s;en&s;es entirely, the better for
your&s;elf and the community. In that
ca&s;e, &s;ome charitable per&s;on might
provide you with a dark room and
clean &s;traw in Bedlam, where it would
not be in your power to infect others
<PB N="47" REF="49">
with your fanatici&s;m; whereas, if you
have ju&s;t reflection enough left to
maintain the character of a cho&s;en ve&s;|&s;el
in the meetings of the godly, you
and your hearers will be mi&s;led by a
Will-i'the-wi&s;p, from one error into
another, till you are plunged into re|ligious
frenzy; and then, perhaps, you
will hang your&s;elf in de&s;pair&mdash;&endq;
&startq;Which the Lord of his infinite mercy
forbid! (exclaimed the affrighted Clin|ker)
It is very po&s;&s;ible I may be under
the temptation of the devil, who wants
to wreck me on the rocks of &s;piritual
pride&mdash;Your honour &s;ays, I am either
a knave or a madman; now, as I'll
a&s;&s;ure your honour I am no knave,
it follows that I mu&s;t be mad; there|fore,
I be&s;eech your honour, upon my
knees, to take my ca&s;e into con&s;idera|tion,
that means may be u&s;ed for my
recovery&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>The '&s;quire could not help &s;miling at
the poor fellow's &s;implicity, and pro|mi&s;ed
to take care of him, provided he
would mind the bu&s;ine&s;s of his place,
without running after the new-light of
methodi&s;m: but Mrs. Tabitha took of|fence
at his humility, which &s;he inter|preted
into poorne&s;s of &s;pirit and world|ly
<PB N="48" REF="50">
mindedne&s;s&mdash;She upbraided him with
the want of courage to &s;uffer for con|&s;cience-&s;ake&mdash;She
ob&s;erved, that if he
&s;hould lo&s;e his place for bearing te&s;ti|mony
to the truth, Providence would not
fail to find him another, perhaps more
advantageous; and, declaring that it
could not be very agreeable to live in a
family where an inqui&s;ition was e&s;tabli&s;h|ed,
retired to another room in great agi|tation.</P>
<P>My uncle followed her with a &s;ignifi|cant
look, then, turning to the preacher,
&startq;You hear what my &s;i&s;ter &s;ays&mdash;If you
cannot live with me upon &s;uch terms
as I have pre&s;cribed, the vineyard of
methodi&s;m lies before you, and &s;he
&s;eems very well di&s;po&s;ed to reward
your labour&mdash;&endq; &startq;I would not will|ingly
give offence to any &s;oul upon
earth (an&s;wered Humphry); her lady|&s;hip
has been very good to me, ever
&s;ince we came to London; and &s;urely
&s;he has a heart turned for religious
exerci&s;es; and both &s;he and lady Gri&s;|kin
&s;ing p&s;alms and hymns like two
cherubims&mdash;But, at the &s;ame time,
I'm bound to love and obey your ho|nour&mdash;It
becometh not &s;uch a poor
ignorant fellow as me, to hold di&s;|pute
<PB N="49" REF="51">
with gentlemen of rank and learn|ing&mdash;As
for the matter of knowledge,
I am no more than a bea&s;t in compa|ri&s;on
of your honour; therefore I &s;ub|mit;
and, with God's grace, I will
follow you to the world's end, if you
don't think me too far gone to be out
of con&s;inement&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>His ma&s;ter promi&s;ed to keep him for
&s;ome time longer on trial; then de&s;ired
to know in what manner lady Gri&s;kin and
Mr. Barton came to join their religious
&s;ociety. He told him, that her lady&s;hip
was the per&s;on who fir&s;t carried my aunt
and &s;i&s;ter to the Tabernacle, whither he
attended them, and had his devotion
kindled by Mr. W&mdash;'s preaching: that
he was confirmed in this new way, by the
preacher's &s;ermons, which he had bought
and &s;tudied with great attention: that
his di&s;cour&s;e and prayers had brought
over Mrs. Jenkins and the hou&s;e-maid to
the &s;ame way of thinking; but as for Mr.
Barton, he had never &s;een him at &s;ervice
before this day, when he came in com|pany
with lady Gri&s;kin&mdash;Humphry,
moreover, owned that he had been en|couraged
to mount the ro&s;trum, by the
example and &s;ucce&s;s of a weaver, who
was much followed as a powerful mini|&s;ter:
<PB N="50" REF="52">
that on his fir&s;t trial, he found him|&s;elf
under &s;uch &s;trong impul&s;ions, as
made him believe he was certainly moved
by the &s;pirit; and that he had a&s;&s;i&s;ted in
lady Gri&s;kin's, and &s;everal private hou&s;es,
at exerci&s;es of devotion.</P>
<P>Mr. Bramble was no &s;ooner informed,
that her lady&s;hip had acted as the primum
mobile of this confederacy, than he con|cluded
&s;he had only made u&s;e of Clinker
as a tool, &s;ub&s;ervient to the execution of
&s;ome de&s;ign, to the true &s;ecret of which
he was an utter &s;tranger&mdash;He ob&s;erved,
that her lady&s;hip's brain was a perfect
mill for projects; and that &s;he and Tab|by
had certainly engaged in &s;ome &s;ecret
treaty, the nature of which he could not
comprehend. I told him I thought it was
no difficult matter to perceive the drift
of Mrs. Tabitha, which was to en&s;nare
the heart of Barton, and that in all like|lihood
my lady Gri&s;kin acted as her auxi|liary:
that this &s;uppo&s;ition would account
for their endeavours to convert him to
methodi&s;m; an event which would occa|&s;ion
a connexion of &s;ouls that might be
ea&s;ily improved into a matrimonial
union.</P>
<P>My uncle &s;eemed to be much divert|ed
by the thoughts of this &s;cheme's
<PB N="51" REF="53">
&s;ucceeding; but I gave him to under|&s;tand,
that Barton was pre-engaged: that
he had the day before made a pre&s;ent of
an etuis to Liddy, which her aunt had
obliged her to receive, with a view, no
doubt, to countenance her own accept|ing
of a &s;nuff-box at the &s;ame time: that
my &s;i&s;ter having made me acquainted
with this incident, I had de&s;ired an ex|planation
of Mr. Barton, who declared
his intentions were honourable, and ex|pre&s;&s;ed
his hope that I would have no ob|jections
to his alliance: that I had thank|ed
him for the honour he intended our
family; but told him, it would be ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to con&s;ult her uncle and aunt,
who were her guardians: and their appro|bation
being obtained, I could have no
objection to his propo&s;al; though I was
per&s;uaded that no violence would be of|fered
to my &s;i&s;ter's inclinations, in a
tran&s;action that &s;o nearly intere&s;ted the
happine&s;s of her future life: that he had
a&s;&s;ured me, he &s;hould never think of a|vailing
him&s;elf of a guardian's authority,
unle&s;s he could render his addre&s;&s;es agree|able
to the young lady her&s;elf; and that
he would immediately demand permi&s;&s;ion
of Mr. and Mi&s;s Bramble, to make Liddy
a tender of his hand and fortune.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="54">
The '&s;quire was not in&s;en&s;ible to the
advantages of &s;uch a match, and declared
he would promote it with all his in|fluence;
but when I took notice that
there &s;eemed to be an aver&s;ion on the
&s;ide of Liddy, he &s;aid he would &s;ound
her on the &s;ubject; and if her reluctance
was &s;uch as would not be ea&s;ily overcome,
he would civilly decline the propo&s;al of
Mr. Barton; for he thought that, in the
choice of a hu&s;band, a young woman
ought not to &s;acrifice the feelings of her
heart for any con&s;ideration upon earth&mdash;
&startq;Liddy is not &s;o de&s;perate (&s;aid he)
as to wor&s;hip fortune at &s;uch an ex|pence.&endq;
I take it for granted, this whole
affair will end in &s;moke; though there
&s;eems to be a &s;torm brewing in the quar|ter
of Mrs. Tabby, who &s;at with all the
&s;ullen dignity of &s;ilence at dinner, &s;eem|ingly
pregnant with complaint and ex|po&s;tulation.
As &s;he hath certainly mark|ed
Barton for her own prey, &s;he cannot
po&s;&s;ibly favour his &s;uit to Liddy; and
therefore I expect &s;omething extraordi|nary
will attend his declaring him&s;elf my
&s;i&s;ter's admirer. This declaration will
certainly be made in form, as &s;oon as the
lover can pick up re&s;olution enough to
&s;tand the brunt of Mrs. Tabby's di&s;ap|pointment;

<OPENER>To Dr. LEWIS.
DEAR LEWIS,</OPENER>
<P>THE deceitful calm was of &s;hort du|ration.
I am plunged again in a &s;ea of
vexation, and the complaints in my
&s;tomach and bowels are returned; &s;o
that I &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hall be di&s;abled from
pro&s;ecuting the excur&s;ion I had planned
&mdash;What the devil had I to do, to come
$word$ plague hunting with a lea&s;h of females
in my train? Ye&s;terday my precious &s;i&s;ter
(who, by the bye, has been for &s;ome time
a profe&s;&s;ed methodi&s;t) came into my a|partment,
attended by Mr. Barton, and
<PB N="54" REF="56">
de&s;ired an audience with a very &s;tately
air&mdash;&startq;Brother, (&s;aid &s;he) this gentle|man
has &s;omething to propo&s;e, which
I flatter my&s;elf will be the more accept|able,
as it will rid you of a trouble|&s;ome
companion.&endq; Then Mr. Barton
proceeded to this effect&mdash;&startq;I am, indeed,
extremely ambitious of being allied to
your family, Mr. Bramble, and I hope
you will &s;ee no cau&s;e to interpo&s;e your
authority.&endq; &startq;As for authority, (&s;aid
Tabby, interrupting him with &s;ome
warmth) I know of none that he has
a right to u&s;e on this occa&s;ion&mdash;If I
pay him the compliment of making
him acquainted with the &s;tep I intend
to take, it is all he can expect in rea|&s;on&mdash;This
is as much as I believe he
would do by me, if he intended to
change his own &s;ituation in life&mdash;In a
word, brother, I am &s;o &s;en&s;ible of Mr.
Barton's extraordinary merit, that I
have been prevailed upon to alter my
re&s;olution of living a &s;ingle life, and to
put my happine&s;s in his hands, by
ve&s;ting him with a legal title to my
per&s;on and fortune, &s;uch as they are.
The bu&s;ine&s;s at pre&s;ent, is to have the
writings drawn; and I &s;hall be obli|ged
<PB N="55" REF="57">
to you, if you will recommend a
lawyer to me for that purpo&s;e&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>You may gue&s;s what an effect this
overture had upon me; who, from the
information of my nephew, expected that
Barton was to make a formal declaration
of his pa&s;&s;ion for Liddy; I could not help
gazing in &s;ilent a&s;toni&s;hment, alternately
at Tabby, and her &s;uppo&s;ed admirer,
which la&s;t hung his head in the mo&s;t auk|ward
confu&s;ion for a few minutes, and
then retired on pretence of being &s;udden|ly
&s;eized with a vertigo&mdash;Mrs. Tabitha
affected much concern, and would have
had him make u&s;e of a bed in the hou&s;e;
but he in&s;i&s;ted upon going home, that he
might have recour&s;e to &s;ome drops, which
he kept for &s;uch emergencies, and his in|namorata
acquie&s;ced&mdash;In the mean time I
was exceedingly puzzled at this adven|ture,
(though I &s;u&s;pected the truth) and
did not know in what manner to demean
my&s;elf towards Mrs. Tabitha, when Jery
came in and told me, he had ju&s;t &s;een Mr.
Barton alight from his chariot at lady
Gri&s;kin's door&mdash;This incident &s;eemed to
threaten a vi&s;it from her lady&s;hip, with
which we were honoured accordingly, in
le&s;s than half an hour&mdash;&startq;I find (&s;aid &s;he)
there has been a match of cro&s;s pur|po&s;es
<PB N="56" REF="58">
among you good folks; and I'm
come to &s;et you to rights&mdash;&endq; So &s;ay|ing,
&s;he pre&s;ented me with the follow|ing
billet&mdash;</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>&startq;Dear Sir,</OPENER>
<P>I no &s;ooner recollected my&s;elf from
the extreme confu&s;ion I was thrown in|to,
by that unlucky mi&s;take of your
&s;i&s;ter, than I thought it my duty to
a&s;&s;ure you, that my devoirs to Mrs.
Bramble never exceeded the bounds of
ordinary civility; and that my heart is
unalterably fixed upon mi&s;s Liddy
Melford, as I had the honour to de|clare
to her brother, when he que&s;tion|ed
me upon that &s;ubject&mdash;Lady Gri&s;kin
has been &s;o good as to charge her&s;elf,
not only with the delivery of this note,
but al&s;o with the ta&s;k of undeceiving
Mrs. Bramble, for whom I have the
mo&s;t profound re&s;pect and veneration,
though my affection being otherwi&s;e
engaged, is no longer in the power

<P><PB N="57" REF="59">
Having ca&s;t my eyes over this billet, I
told her lady&s;hip, that I would no lon|ger
retard the friendly office &s;he had un|dertaken;
and I and Jery forthwith re|tired
into another room. There we &s;oon
perceived the conver&s;ation grow very
warm betwixt the two ladies; and, at
length, could di&s;tinctly hear certain terms
of altercation, which we could no longer
delay interrupting, with any regard to de|corum.
When we entered the &s;cene of
contention, we found Liddy had joined
the di&s;putants, and &s;tood trembling be|twixt
them, as if &s;he had been afraid they
would have proceeded to &s;omething more
practical than words&mdash;Lady Gri&s;kin's
face was like the full moon in a &s;torm of
wind, glaring, fiery, and portentuous;
while Tabby looked grim and gha&s;tly,
with an a&s;pect breathing di&s;cord and di&s;|may.&mdash;Our
appearance put a &s;top to their
mutual revilings; but her lady&s;hip turn|ing
to me, &startq;Cou&s;in, (&s;aid &s;he) I can't
help &s;aying I have met with a very un|grateful
return from this lady, for the
pains I have taken to &s;erve her fami|ly&mdash;&endq;
&startq;My family is much obliged
to your lady&s;hip (cried Tabby, with a
kind of hy&s;terical giggle); but we
have no right to the good offices of
<PB N="58" REF="60">
&s;uch an honourable go-between.&endq;
&startq;But, for all that, good Mrs. Tabitha
Bramble, (re&s;umed the other) I &s;hall
be content with the reflection, That
virtue is its own reward; and it &s;hall
not be my fault, if you continue to
make your&s;elf ridiculous&mdash;Mr. Bram|ble,
who has no little intere&s;t of his
own to &s;erve, will, no doubt, contri|bute
all in his power to promote a
match betwixt Mr. Barton and his
niece, which will be equally honour|able
and advantageous; and, I dare
&s;ay, mi&s;s Liddy her&s;elf will have no
objection to a mea&s;ure &s;o well calcu|lated
to make her happy in life&mdash;&endq;
&startq;I beg your lady&s;hip's pardon, (exclaim|ed
Liddy, with great vivacity) I have
nothing but mi&s;ery to expect from &s;uch
a mea&s;ure; and I hope my guardians
will have too much compa&s;&s;ion, to bar|ter
my peace of mind for any con&s;ide|ration
of intere&s;t or fortune&mdash;&endq; &startq;Up|on
my word, mi&s;s Liddy! (&s;aid &s;he)
you have profited by the example of
your good aunt&mdash;I comprehend your
meaning, and will explain it when I
have a proper opportunity&mdash;In the
mean time, I &s;hall take my leave&mdash;
Madam, your mo&s;t obedient, and de|voted
<PB N="59" REF="61">
humble &s;ervant.&endq; &s;aid &s;he, ad|vancing
clo&s;e up to my &s;i&s;ter, and curt&s;y|ing
&s;o low, that I thought &s;he intended to
&s;quat her&s;elf down on the floor&mdash;This
&s;alutation Tabby returned with equal &s;o|lemnity;
and the expre&s;&s;ion of the two
faces, while they continued in this atti|tude,
would be no bad &s;ubject for a pen|cil
like that of the incomparable Ho|garth,
if any &s;uch &s;hould ever appear
again, in the&s;e times of dulne&s;s and de|generacy.</P>
<P>Jery accompanied her lady&s;hip to her
hou&s;e, that he might have an opportu|nity
to re&s;tore the etuis to Barton, and
advi&s;e him to give up his &s;uit, which
was &s;o di&s;agreeable to his &s;i&s;ter, again&s;t
whom, however, he returned much irri|tated&mdash;Lady
Gri&s;kin had a&s;&s;ured him that
Liddy's heart was pre-occupied; and im|mediately
the idea of Wil&s;on recurring to
his imagination, his family-pride took the
alarm&mdash;He denounced vengeance again&s;t
that adventurer, and was di&s;po&s;ed to be
very peremptory with his &s;i&s;ter; but I
de&s;ired he would &s;uppre&s;s his re&s;entment,
until I &s;hould have talked with her in
private.</P>
<P>The poor girl, when I earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;|ed
her on this head, owned, with a flood
<PB N="60" REF="62">
of tears, that Wil&s;on had actually come
to the Hot Well at Bri&s;tol, and even in|troduced
him&s;elf into our lodgings as a
Jew pedlar; but that nothing had pa&s;&s;ed
betwixt them, further than her begging
him to withdraw immediately, if he had
any regard for her peace of mind: that
he had di&s;appeared accordingly, after
having attempted to prevail upon my
&s;i&s;ter's maid, to deliver a letter; which,
however, &s;he refu&s;ed to receive, though
&s;he had con&s;ented to carry a me&s;&s;age, im|porting
that he was a gentleman of a good
family; and that, in a very little time, he
would avow his pa&s;&s;ion in that character
&mdash;She confe&s;&s;ed, that although he had
not kept his word in this particular, he
was not yet altogether indifferent to her
affection; but &s;olemnly promi&s;ed, &s;he
would never carry on any corre&s;pondence
with him, or any other admirer, for the
future, without the privity and approba|tion
of her brother and me.</P>
<P>By this declaration, &s;he made her own
peace with Jery; but the hot-headed boy
is more than ever incen&s;ed again&s;t Wil|&s;on,
whom he now con&s;iders as an im|po&s;tor,
that harbours &s;ome infamous de|&s;ign
upon the honour of his family&mdash;As
for Barton, he was not a little mortified
<PB N="61" REF="63">
to find his pre&s;ent returned, and his ad|dre&s;&s;es
&s;o unfavourably received; but he
is not a man to be deeply affected by &s;uch
di&s;appointments; and I know not whe|ther
he is not as well plea&s;ed with being
di&s;carded by Liddy, as he would have
been with a permi&s;&s;ion to pro&s;ecute his
preten&s;ions, at the ri&s;que of being every
day expo&s;ed to the revenge or machina|tions
of Tabby, who is not to be &s;lighted
with impunity.&mdash;I had not much time
to moralize on the&s;e occurrences; for the
hou&s;e was vi&s;ited by a con&s;table and his
gang, with a warrant from ju&s;tice Buz|zard,
to &s;earch the box of Humphry
Clinker, my footman, who was ju&s;t ap|prehended
as a highwayman&mdash;This inci|dent
threw the whole family into confu|&s;ion.
My &s;i&s;ter &s;colded the con&s;table for
pre&s;uming to enter the lodgings of a gen|tleman
on &s;uch an errand, without having
fir&s;t a&s;ked, and obtained permi&s;&s;ion; her
maid was frightened into fits, and Lid|dy
&s;hed tears of compa&s;&s;ion for the un|fortunate
Clinker, in who&s;e box, how|ever,
nothing was found to confirm the
&s;u&s;picion of robbery.</P>
<P>For my own part, I made no doubt of
the fellow's being mi&s;taken for &s;ome
other per&s;on, and I went directly to
<PB N="62" REF="64">
the ju&s;tice, in order to procure his di&s;|charge;
but there I found the matter
much more &s;erious than I expected&mdash;Poor
Clinker &s;tood trembling at the bar, &s;ur|rounded
by thief-takers; and at a little
di&s;tance, a thick, &s;quat fellow, a po&s;ti|lion,
his accu&s;er, who had &s;eized him in
the &s;treet, and &s;wore po&s;itively to his per|&s;on,
that the &s;aid Clinker had, on the
15th day of March la&s;t, on Blackheath,
robbed a gentleman in a po&s;t-chai&s;e,
which he (the po&s;tilion) drove&mdash;This de|po&s;ition
was &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify his com|mitment;
and he was &s;ent accordingly to
Clerkenwell pri&s;on, whither Jery accom|panied
him in the coach, in order to re|commend
him properly to the keeper,
that he may want for no convenience
which the place affords.</P>
<P>The &s;pectators, who a&s;&s;embled to &s;ee
this highwayman, were &s;agacious enough
to di&s;cern &s;omething very villanous in his
a&s;pect; which (begging their pardon) is
the very picture of &s;implicity; and the
ju&s;tice him&s;elf put a very unfavourable
con&s;truction upon &s;ome of his an&s;wers,
which, he &s;aid, &s;avoured of the ambi|guity
and equivocation of an old offender;
but, in my opinion, it would have been
more ju&s;t and humane to impute them
to the confu&s;ion into which we may &s;up|po&s;e
<PB N="63" REF="65">
a poor country lad to be thrown on
&s;uch an occa&s;ion. I am &s;till per&s;uaded he
is innocent; and, in this per&s;ua&s;ion, I can

<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bart. of
Je&s;us college, Oxon.
DEAR WAT,</OPENER>
<P>THE farce is fini&s;hed, and another
piece of a graver ca&s;t brought upon
the &s;tage.&mdash;Our aunt made a de&s;perate
attack upon Barton, who had no other
way of &s;aving him&s;elf, but by leaving her
in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the field, and avowing his
preten&s;ions to Liddy, by whom he has been
rejected in his turn.&mdash;Lady Gri&s;kin acted
as his advocate and agent on this occa&s;ion,
with &s;uch zeal as embroiled her with Mrs.
Tabitha, and a high &s;cene of altercation
pa&s;&s;ed betwixt the&s;e two religioni&s;ts,
which might have come to action, had
not my uncle interpo&s;ed. They are how|ever
reconciled, in con&s;equence of an
event which hath involved us all in trou|ble
and di&s;quiet. You mu&s;t know, the
poor preacher, Humphry Clinker, is now
exerci&s;ing his mini&s;try among the felons
in Clerkenwell pri&s;on.&mdash;A po&s;tilion hav|ing
<PB N="65" REF="67">
&s;worn a robbery again&s;t him, no bail
could be taken, and he was committed to
jail, notwith&s;tanding all the remon&s;trances
and intere&s;t my uncle could make in his
behalf.</P>
<P>All things con&s;idered, the poor fellow
cannot po&s;&s;ibly be guilty, and yet, I be|lieve,
he runs &s;ome ri&s;que of being hang|ed.&mdash;Upon
his examination, he an&s;wered
with &s;uch he&s;itation and re&s;erve, as per|&s;uaded
mo&s;t of the people, who crowded
the place, that he was really a knave, and
the ju&s;tice's remarks confirmed their opi|nion.
Exclu&s;ive of my uncle and my&s;elf,
there was only one per&s;on who &s;eemed in|clined
to favour the culprit.&mdash;He was
a young man, well dre&s;&s;ed, and, from
the manner in which he cro&s;s-examined
the evidence, we took it for granted,
that he was a &s;tudent in one of the
inns of court.&mdash;He freely checked the
ju&s;tice for &s;ome uncharitable inferences he
made to the prejudice of the pri&s;oner,
and even ventured to di&s;pute with his
wor&s;hip on certain points of law.</P>
<P>My uncle, provoked at the uncon|nected
and dubious an&s;wers of Clinker,
who &s;eemed in danger of falling a &s;acri|fice
to his own &s;implicity, exclaimed, &startq;In
the name of God, if you are innocent,
<PB N="66" REF="68">
&s;ay &s;o.&endq; &startq;No, (cried he) God forbid,
that I &s;hould call my&s;elf innocent, while
my con&s;cience is burthened with &s;in.&endq;
&startq;What then, you did commit this rob|bery?&endq;
re&s;umed his ma&s;ter. &startq;No,
&s;ure, (&s;aid he) ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord,
I'm free of that guilt.&endq;</P>
<P>Here the ju&s;tice interpo&s;ed, ob&s;erving,
that the man &s;eemed inclined to make a
di&s;covery by turning king's evidence, and
de&s;ired the clerk to take his confe&s;&s;ion;
upon which Humphry declared, that he
looked upon confe&s;&s;ion to be a popi&s;h
fraud, invented by the whore of Babylon.
The Templar affirmed, that the poor fel|low
was <HI>non compos;</HI> and exhorted the
ju&s;tice to di&s;charge him as a lunatic.&mdash;
&startq;You know very well, (added he) that
the robbery in que&s;tion was not com|mitted
by the pri&s;oner.&endq;</P>
<P>The thief-takers grinned at one an|other;
and Mr. Ju&s;tice Buzzard replied
with great emotion, &startq;Mr. Martin, I de&s;ire
you will mind your own bu&s;ine&s;s; I
&s;hall convince you one of the&s;e days
that I under&s;tand mine.&endq; In &s;hort,
there was no remedy; the mittimus was
made out, and poor Clinker &s;ent to pri&s;on
in a hackney-coach, guarded by the con|&s;table,
and accompanied by your humble
<PB N="67" REF="69">
&s;ervant. By the way, I was not a little
&s;urpri&s;ed to hear this retainer to ju&s;tice
bid the pri&s;oner to keep up his &s;pirits,
for that he did not at all doubt, but that
he would get off for a few weeks confine|ment.&mdash;He
&s;aid, his wor&s;hip knew very
well that Clinker was innocent of the fact,
and that the real highwayman, who rob|bed
the chai&s;e, was no other than that
very individual Mr. Martin, who had
pleaded &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly for hone&s;t Hum|phry.</P>
<P>Confounded at this information, I a&s;k|ed,
&startq;Why then is he &s;uffered to go
about at his liberty, and this poor
innocent fellow treated as a malefac|tor?&endq;
&startq;We have exact intelligence
of all Mr. Martin's tran&s;actions; (&s;aid
he) but as yet there is not evidence
&s;ufficient for his conviction; and as for
this young man, the ju&s;tice could do
no le&s;s than commit him, as the po&s;ti|lion
&s;wore point-blank to his identity.&endq;
&startq;So if this ra&s;cally po&s;tilion &s;hould per|&s;i&s;t
in the fal&s;ity to which he is &s;worn,
(&s;aid I) this innocent lad may be brought
to the gallows.&endq;</P>
<P>The con&s;table ob&s;erved, that he would
have time enough to prepare for his trial,
and might prove an <HI>alibi;</HI> or, perhaps,
<PB N="68" REF="70">
Martin might be apprehended and con|victed
for another fact; in which ca&s;e,
he might be prevailed upon to take this
affair upon him&s;elf; or, finally, if the&s;e
chances &s;hould fail, and the evidence
&s;tand good again&s;t Clinker, the jury
might recommend him to mercy, in con|&s;ideration
of his youth, e&s;pecially if this
&s;hould appear to be the fir&s;t fact of which
he had been guilty.</P>
<P>Humphry owned, he could not pretend
to recollect where he had been on the
day when the robbery was committed,
much le&s;s prove a circum&s;tance of that
kind &s;o far back as &s;ix months, though he
knew he had been &s;ick of the fever and
ague, which, however, did not prevent
him from going about&mdash;then, turning up
his eyes, he ejaculated, &startq;The Lord's will
be done! if it be my fate to &s;uffer, I
hope I &s;hall not di&s;grace the faith, of
which, though unworthy, I make pro|fe&s;&s;ion.&endq;</P>
<P>When I expre&s;&s;ed my &s;urprize, that
the accu&s;er &s;hould per&s;i&s;t in charging
Clinker, without taking the lea&s;t notice
of the real robber, who &s;tood before him,
and to whom, indeed, Humphry bore not
the &s;malle&s;t re&s;emblance; the con&s;table
(who was him&s;elf a thief-taker) gave me
<PB N="69" REF="71">
to under&s;tand, that Mr. Martin was the
be&s;t qualified for bu&s;ine&s;s of all the gentle|men
on the road he had ever known;
that he had always acted on his own bot|tom,
without partner or corre&s;pondent,
and never went to work, but when he
was cool and &s;ober; that his courage and
pre&s;ence of mind never failed him; that
his addre&s;s was genteel, and his behaviour
void of all cruelty and in&s;olence; that he
never encumbered him&s;elf with watches or
trinkets, nor even with bank-notes, but
always dealt for ready money, and that in
the current coin of the kingdom; and
that he could di&s;gui&s;e him&s;elf and his
hor&s;e in &s;uch a manner, that, after the ac|tion,
it was impo&s;&s;ible to recognize either
the one or the other&mdash;&startq;This great man
(&s;aid he) has reigned paramount in all
the roads within fifty miles of London
above fifteen months, and has done
more bu&s;ine&s;s in that time, than all
the re&s;t of the profe&s;&s;ion put together;
for tho&s;e who pa&s;s through his hands
are &s;o delicately dealt with, that they
have no de&s;ire to give him the lea&s;t di&s;|turbance;
but for all that, his race is
almo&s;t run&mdash;he is now fluttering about
ju&s;tice, like a moth about a candle&mdash;
there are &s;o many lime-twigs laid in his
<PB N="70" REF="72">
way, that I'll bett a cool hundred, he
&s;wings before Chri&s;tmas.&endq;</P>
<P>Shall I own to you, that this portrait,
drawn by a ruffian, heightened by what I
my&s;elf had ob&s;erved in his deportment,
has intere&s;ted me warmly in the fate of
poor Martin, whom nature &s;eems to have
intended for a u&s;eful and honourable
member of that community upon which he
now preys for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence? It &s;eems, he
lived &s;ome time as a clerk to a timber-|merchant,
who&s;e daughter Martin having
privately married, was di&s;carded, and his
wife turned out of doors. She did not
long &s;urvive her marriage; and Martin,
turning fortune-hunter, could not &s;upply
his occa&s;ions any other way, than by tak|ing
to the road, in which he has travelled
hitherto with uncommon &s;ucce&s;s.&mdash;He
pays his re&s;pects regularly to Mr. Ju&s;tice
Buzzard, the thief-catcher-general of this
metropolis, and &s;ometimes they &s;moke a
pipe together very lovingly, when the
conver&s;ation generally turns upon the na|ture
of evidence.&mdash;The ju&s;tice has given
him fair warning to take care of him&s;elf,
and he has received his caution in good
part.&mdash;Hitherto he has baffled all the vi|gilance,
art, and activity of Buzzard and
his emi&s;&s;aries, with &s;uch conduct as would
<PB N="71" REF="73">
have done honour to the genius of a
Cae&s;ar or a Turenne; but he has one
weakne&s;s, which has proved fatal to all
the heroes of his tribe, namely, an in|di&s;creet
devotion to the fair &s;ex, and, in
all probability, he will be attacked on
this defencele&s;s quarter.</P>
<P>Be that as it may, I &s;aw the body of
poor Clinker con&s;igned to the gaoler of
Clerkenwell, to who&s;e indulgence I re|commended
him &s;o effectually, that he
received him in the mo&s;t ho&s;pitable man|ner,
though there was a nece&s;&s;ity for
equipping him with a &s;uit of irons, in
which he made a very rueful appearance.
The poor creature &s;eemed as much affect|ed
by my uncle's kindne&s;s, as by his own
misfortune. When I a&s;&s;ured him, that
nothing &s;hould be left undone for pro|curing
his enlargement, and making his
confinement ea&s;y in the mean time, he fell
down on his knees, and ki&s;&s;ing my hand,
which he bathed with his tears, &startq;O
'&s;quire! (cried he, &s;obbing) what &s;hall I
&s;ay?&mdash;I can't&mdash;no, I can't &s;peak&mdash;my
poor heart is bur&s;ting with gratitude to
you and my dear&mdash;dear&mdash;generous&mdash;
noble benefactor.&endq;</P>
<P>I prote&s;t, the &s;cene became &s;o pathetic,
that I was fain to force my&s;elf away, and
<PB N="72" REF="74">
returned to my uncle, who &s;ent me in the
afternoon with a compliment to one Mr.
Mead, the per&s;on who had been robbed
on Black-heath. As I did not find him
at home, I left a me&s;&s;age, in con&s;equence
of which he called at our lodgings this
morning, and very humanely agreed to
vi&s;it the pri&s;oner. By this time, lady
Gri&s;kin had come to make her formal
compliments of condolance to Mrs. Tabi|tha,
on this dome&s;tic calamity; and that
prudent maiden, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ion was now
cooled, thought proper to receive her
lady&s;hip &s;o civilly, that a reconcilia|tion
immediately en&s;ued. The&s;e two
ladies re&s;olved to comfort the poor
pri&s;oner in their own per&s;ons, and Mr.
Mead and I '&s;quired them to Clerkenwell,
my uncle being detained at home by
&s;ome &s;light complaints in his &s;tomach and
bowels.</P>
<P>The turnkey, who received us at Clerk|enwell,
looked remarkably &s;ullen; and
when we enquired for Clinker, &startq;I don't
care, if the devil had him; (&s;aid he)
here has been nothing but canting and
praying &s;ince the fellow entered the
place.&mdash;Rabbit him! the tap will be
ruined&mdash;we han't &s;old a ca&s;k of beer,
nor a dozen of wine, &s;ince he paid his
<PB N="73" REF="75">
gentlemen get drunk with
nothing but your damned religion.&mdash;
For my part, I believe as how your
man deals with the devil.&mdash;Two or
three as bold hearts as ever took the air
upon Houn&s;low, have been blubbering
all night; and if the fellow an't &s;peedi|ly
removed by Habeas Corpus, or
otherwi&s;e, I'll be damn'd if there's a
grain of true &s;pirit left within the&s;e
walls&mdash;we &s;han't have a &s;oul to do cre|dit
to the place, or make his exit like a
true born Engli&s;hman&mdash;damn my eyes!
there will be nothing but &s;nivelling in
the cart&mdash;we &s;hall all die like &s;o many
p&s;alm &s;inging weavers.&endq;</P>
<P>In &s;hort, we found that Humphry was,
at that very in&s;tant, haranguing the fe|lons
in the chapel; and that the gaoler's
wife and daughter, together with my
aunt's woman, Win Jenkins, and our
hou&s;e-maid, were among the audience,
which we immediately joined. I never
&s;aw any thing &s;o &s;trongly picture&s;que as
this congregation of felons clanking their
chains, in the mid&s;t of whom &s;tood orator
Clinker, expatiating, in a tran&s;port of
fervor, on the torments of hell, denoun|ced
in &s;cripture again&s;t evil-doers, com|prehending
murderers, robbers, thieves,
<PB N="74" REF="76">
and whoremongers. The variety of at|tention
exhibited in the faces of tho&s;e
ragamuffins, formed a groupe that would
not have di&s;graced the pencil of a Ra|phael.
In one, it denoted admiration;
in another, doubt; in a third, di&s;dain;
in a fourth, contempt; in a fifth, terror;
in a &s;ixth, deri&s;ion; and in a &s;eventh, in|dignation.&mdash;As
for Mrs. Winifred Jen|kin$s,
&s;he was in tears, overwhelmed with
&s;orrow; but whether for her own &s;ins, or
the misfortune of Clinker, I cannot pre|tend
to &s;ay. The other females &s;eemed
to li&s;ten with a mixture of wonder and de|votion.
The gaoler's wife declared he
was a &s;aint in trouble, &s;aying, &s;he wi&s;hed
from her heart, there was &s;uch another
good &s;oul, like him, in every gaol in Eng|land.</P>
<P>Mr. Mead, having earne&s;tly &s;urveyed
the preacher, declared his appearance
was &s;o different from that of the per&s;on
who robbed him on Black-heath, that he
could freely make oath he was not the
man: but Humphry him&s;elf was by this
time pretty well rid of all apprehen&s;ions
of being hanged; for he had been the
night before &s;olemnly tried and acquitted
by his fellow-pri&s;oners, &s;ome of whom he
had already converted to methodi&s;m. He
<PB N="75" REF="77">
now made proper acknowledgements for
the honour of our vi&s;it, and was permit|ted
to ki&s;s the hands of the ladies, who
a&s;&s;ured him, he might depend upon their
friend&s;hip and protection. Lady Gri&s;kin,
in her great zeal, exhorted his fellow-pri|&s;oners
to profit by the precious opportu|nity
of having &s;uch a &s;aint in bonds among
them, and turn over a new leaf for the
benefit of their poor &s;ouls; and, that her
admonition might have the greater effect,
&s;he reinforced it with her bounty.</P>
<P>While &s;he and Mrs. Tabby returned in
the coach with the two maid-&s;ervants, I
waited on Mr. Mead to the hou&s;e of ju&s;|tice
Buzzard, who, having heard his de|claration,
&s;aid his oath could be of no
u&s;e at pre&s;ent, but that he would be a ma|terial
evidence for the pri&s;oner at his trial;
&s;o that there &s;eems to be no remedy but
patience for poor Clinker; and, indeed,
the &s;ame virtue, or medicine, will be ne|ce&s;&s;ary
for us all, the '&s;quire in parti|cular,
who had &s;et his heart upon his
excur&s;ion to the northward.</P>
<P>While we were vi&s;iting hone&s;t Hum|phry
in Clerkenwell pri&s;on, my uncle re|ceived
a much more extraordinary vi&s;it at
his own lodgings. Mr. Martin, of whom
I have made &s;uch honourable mention,
<PB N="76" REF="78">
de&s;ired permi&s;&s;ion to pay him his re&s;pects,
and was admitted accordingly. He told
him, that having ob&s;erved him, at Mr.
Buzzard's, a good deal di&s;turbed by what
had happened to his &s;ervant, he had come
to a&s;&s;ure him he had nothing to apprehend
for Clinker's life; for, if it was po&s;&s;ible
that any jury could find him guilty upon
&s;uch evidence, he, Martin him&s;elf, would
produce in court a per&s;on, who&s;e depo&s;i|tion
would bring him off clear as the &s;un
at noon.&mdash;Sure, the fellow would not be
&s;o romantic as to take the robbery upon
him&s;elf!&mdash;He &s;aid, the po&s;tilion was an
infamous fellow, who had been a dabbler
in the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion, and &s;aved his life at
the Old Bailey by impeaching his compa|nions;
that being now reduced to great
poverty, he had made this de&s;perate pu&s;h,
to &s;wear away the life of an innocent
man, in hopes of having the reward upon
his conviction; but that he would find
him&s;elf mi&s;erably di&s;appointed, for the
ju&s;tice and his myrmidons were deter|mined
to admit of no interloper in this
branch of bu&s;ine&s;s; and that he did not
at all doubt but that they would find
matter enough to &s;hop the evidence him|&s;elf
before the next gaol-delivery. He
affirmed, that all the&s;e circum&s;tances were
<PB N="77" REF="79">
well known to the ju&s;tice; and that his
&s;everity to Clinker was no other than a
hint to his ma&s;ter to make him a pre&s;ent
in private, as an acknowledgement of his
candour and humanity.</P>
<P>This hint, however, was &s;o unpalat|able
to Mr. Bramble, that he declared,
with great warmth, he would rather con|fine
him&s;elf for life to London, which he
dete&s;ted, than be at liberty to leave it
to-morrow, in con&s;equence of encouraging
corruption in a magi&s;trate. Hearing&punc;
however, how favourable Mr. Mead's
report had been for the pri&s;oner, he is re|&s;olved
to take the advice of coun&s;el in
what manner to proceed for his imme|diate
enlargement. I make no doubt,
but that in a day or two this trouble&s;ome
bu&s;ine&s;s may be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed; and in this
hope we are preparing for our journey.

<OPENER>To Dr. LEWIS.</OPENER>
<P>THANK Heaven! dear Lewis, the
clouds are di&s;per&s;ed, and I have now the
cleare&s;t pro&s;pect of my &s;ummer campaign,
which, I hope, I &s;hall be able to begin
to-morrow. I took the advice of coun|&s;el,
with re&s;pect to the ca&s;e of Clinker, in
who&s;e favour a lucky incident has inter|vened.
The fellow who accu&s;ed him,
has had his own battery turned upon him|&s;elf.&mdash;Two
days ago, he was apprehend|ed
for a robbery on the highway, and
committed, on the evidence of an accom|plice.
Clinker, having moved for a writ
of <HI>habeas corpus,</HI> was brought before the
lord chief ju&s;tice, who, in con&s;equence
of an affidavit of the gentleman who had
been robbed, importing that the &s;aid Clink|er
was not the per&s;on who &s;topped him on
the highway, as well as in con&s;ideration of
the po&s;tilion's character and pre&s;ent cir|cum&s;tances,
was plea&s;ed to order, that my
&s;ervant &s;hould be admitted to bail, and
he has been di&s;charged accordingly, to
the un&s;peakable &s;atisfaction of our whole
<PB N="79" REF="81">
family, to which he has recommended
him&s;elf in an extraordinary manner, not
only by his obliging deportment, but by
his talents of preaching, praying, and
&s;inging p&s;alms, which he has exerci&s;ed
with &s;uch effect, that even Tabby re&s;pects
him as a cho&s;en ve&s;&s;el. If there was any
thing like affectation or hypocri&s;y in this
exce&s;s of religion, I would not keep him
in my &s;ervice; but, &s;o far as I can ob|&s;erve,
the fellow's character is downright
&s;implicity, warmed with a kind of enthu|&s;ia&s;m,
which renders him very &s;u&s;ceptible
of gratitude and attachment to his bene|factors.</P>
<P>As he is an excellent hor&s;eman, and
under&s;tands farriery, I have bought a
&s;tout gelding for his u&s;e, that he may at|tend
us on the road, and have an eye to
our cattle, in ca&s;e the coachman &s;hould not
mind his bu&s;ine&s;s. My nephew, who is
to ride his own &s;addle hor&s;e, has taken,
upon trial, a &s;ervant ju&s;t come from
abroad with his former ma&s;ter, &s;ir Wil|liam
Strollop, who vouches for his ho|ne&s;ty.
The fellow, who&s;e name is Dut|ton,
&s;eems to be a petit-maitre.&mdash;He has
got a &s;mattering of French, bows, and
grins, and &s;hrugs, and takes &s;nuff <HI>a la
mode de France,</HI> but values him&s;elf chiefly
<PB N="80" REF="82">
upon his &s;kill and dexterity in hair-dre&s;|&s;ing.&mdash;If
I am not much deceived by ap|pearance,
he is, in all re&s;pects, the very
contra&s;t of Humphry Clinker.</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ter has made up matters with
lady Gri&s;kin; though, I mu&s;t own, I
&s;hould not have been &s;orry to &s;ee that
connexion entirely de&s;troyed: but Tabby
is not of a di&s;po&s;ition to forgive Barton,
who, I under&s;tand, is gone to his &s;eat in
Berk&s;hire for the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on. I can|not
help &s;u&s;pecting, that in the treaty of
peace, which has been lately ratified be|twixt
tho&s;e two females, it is &s;tipulated,
that her lady&s;hip &s;hall u&s;e her be&s;t endea|vours
to provide an agreeable help-mate
for our &s;i&s;ter Tabitha, who &s;eems to be
quite de&s;perate in her matrimonial de|&s;igns.
Perhaps, the match-maker is to
have a valuable con&s;ideration in the way
of brokerage, which &s;he will mo&s;t cer|tainly
de&s;erve, if &s;he can find any man in
his &s;en&s;es, who will yoke with Mrs. Bram|ble
from motives of affection or intere&s;t.</P>
<P>I find my &s;pirits and my health affect
each other reciprocally&mdash;that is to &s;ay,
every thing that di&s;compo&s;es my mind,
produces a corre&s;pondent di&s;order in my
body; and my bodily complaints are re|markably
mitigated by tho&s;e con&s;idera|tions
<PB N="81" REF="83">
that di&s;&s;ipate the clouds of mental
chagrin.&mdash;The impri&s;onment of Clinker
brought on tho&s;e &s;ymptoms which I men|tioned
in my la&s;t, and now they are va|ni&s;hed
at his di&s;charge.&mdash;It mu&s;t be own|ed,
indeed, I took &s;ome of the tinc|ture
of gin&s;eng, prepared according to
your pre&s;cription, and found it exceeding|ly
grateful to the &s;tomach; but the pain
and &s;ickne&s;s continued to return, after
&s;hort intervals, till the anxiety of my
mind was entirely removed, and then I
found my&s;elf perfectly at ea&s;e. We have
had fair weather the&s;e ten days, to the

<P>HAVING the occa&s;ion of my cou&s;in

yards of green ribbon, and a &s;arment

Clinker has been in trouble, but the gates
of hell have not been able to prevail
again him.&mdash;His virtue is like poor
gould, &s;even times tried in the fire. He
was tuck up for a rubbery, and had be|fore
gu&s;ta&s;s Bu&s;shard, who made his mit|tamou&s;e;
<PB N="83" REF="85">
and the pore youth was &s;ent to
pri&s;on upon the fal&s;e oaf of a willian, that
wanted to &s;ware his life away for the
looker of cain.</P>
<P>The '&s;quire did all in his power, but
could not prevent his being put in chains,
and confined among common manufac|tors,
where he &s;tud like an innocent
&s;heep in the mid&s;t of wolves and tygers.&mdash;
Lord knows, what mought have happened
to this pyehou&s;e young man, if ma&s;ter
had not applied to Apias Korkus, who
lives with the ould bailiff, and is, they
&s;ay, five hundred years ould, (God ble&s;s

he wouldn't have &s;ought out Mr.
Clinker, as he did, in &s;pite of &s;tone walls,
iron bolts, and double locks, that flew
open at his command; for Ould Scratch
has not a greater enemy upon hearth than
Mr. Clinker, who is, indeed, a very
powerfull labourer in the Lord's vine|yard.
I do no more than yu&s;e the words
of my good lady, who has got the infec|tual

<PB N="87" REF="89">
<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bar^t. of
Je&s;us college, Oxon.
DEAR PHILLIPS,</OPENER>
<P>THE very day after I wrote my la&s;t,
Clinker was &s;et at liberty&mdash;As Martin
had foretold, the accu&s;er was him&s;elf
committed for a robbery, upon unque&s;|tionable
evidence. He had been for &s;ome
time in the &s;nares of the thief-taking &s;o|ciety;
who, re&s;enting his pre&s;umption
in attempting to incroach upon their mo|nopoly
of impeachment, had him taken
up and committed to Newgate, on the
depo&s;ition of an accomplice, who has
been admitted as evidence for the king.
The po&s;$ilion being upon record as an
old offender, the chief ju&s;tice made no
&s;cruple of admitting Clinker to bail,
when he peru&s;ed the affidavit of Mr.
Mead, importing that the &s;aid Clinker
was not the per&s;on that robbed him o$
Blackheath; and hone&s;t Humphry was
di&s;charged&mdash;When he came home, he ex|pre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="88" REF="90">
great eagerne&s;s to pay his re&s;pects
to his ma&s;ter, and here his elocution fail|ed
him, but his &s;ilence was pathetic; he
fell down at his feet, and embraced his
knees, &s;heding a flood of tears, which
my uncle did not &s;ee without emotion&mdash;
He took &s;nuff in &s;ome confu&s;ion; and,
putting his hand in his pocket, gave him
his ble&s;&s;ing in &s;omething more &s;ub&s;tantial
than words&mdash;&startq;Clinker, (&s;aid he) I am
&s;o well convinced, both of your ho|ne&s;ty
and courage, that I am re&s;olved
to make you my life-guard-man on the
highway.&endq;</P>
<P>He was accordingly provided with a
ca&s;e of pi&s;tols, and a carbine to be &s;lung
a-cro&s;s his &s;houlders; and every other
preparation being made, we &s;et out la&s;t
Thur&s;day, at &s;even in the morning; my
uncle, with the three women in the
coach; Humphry, well mounted on a
black gelding bought for his u&s;e; my|&s;elf
a-hor&s;eback, attended by my new
valet, Mr. Dutton, an exceeding cox|comb,
fre&s;h from his travels, whom I
have taken upon trial&mdash;The fellow wears
a &s;olitaire, u&s;es paint, and takes rappee
with all the grimace of a French marquis.
At pre&s;ent, however, he is in a riding-dre&s;s,
jack-boots, leather breeches, a
<PB N="89" REF="91">
&s;carlet wai&s;tcoat, with gold binding, a
laced hat, a hanger, a French po&s;ting-whip
in his hand, and his hair <HI>en
queue.</HI></P>
<P>Before we had gone nine miles, my
hor&s;e lo&s;t one of his &s;hoes; &s;o that I was
obliged to &s;top at Barnet to have another,
while the coach proceeded at an ea&s;y
pace over the common. About a mile
&s;hort of Hatfield, the po&s;tilions, &s;topping
the carriage, gave notice to Clinker that
there were two &s;u&s;picious fellows a-hor&s;e-|back,
at the end of a lane, who &s;eemed
waiting to attack the coach. Humphry
forthwith appri&s;ed my uncle, declaring
he would &s;tand by him to the la&s;t drop
of his blood; and, un&s;linging his carbine,
prepared for action. The '&s;quire had
pi&s;tols in the pockets of the coach, and re|&s;olved
to make u&s;e of them directly; but
he was effectually prevented by his fe|male
companions, who flung them&s;elves
about his neck, and &s;creamed in concert
&mdash;At that in&s;tant, who &s;hould come up
at a hand-gallop, but Martin, the high|way-man,
who, advancing to the coach,
begged the ladies would compo&s;e them|&s;elves
for a moment; then, de&s;iring
Clinker to follow him to the charge, he
pulled a pi&s;tol out of his bo&s;om, and
<PB N="90" REF="92">
they $word$ up together to give battle to
the rog$$s, who, having fired at a great
di&s;tance, fled a-cro&s;s the common. They
were in pur&s;uit of the fugitives when I
came up, not a little alarmed at the
&s;hreiks in the coach, where I found my
uncle in a violent rage, without his peri|wig,
&s;truggling to di&s;entangle him&s;elf
from Tabby and the other two, and
&s;wearing with great vociferation. Before
I had time to interpo&s;e, Martin and
Clinker returned from the pur&s;uit, and
the former payed his compliments with
great politene&s;s, giving us to under&s;tand,
that the fellows had &s;campered off, and
that he believed they were a couple of
raw 'prentices from London. He com|mended
Clinker for his courage, and
&s;aid, if we would give him leave, he
would have the honour to accompany us
as far as Stevenage, where he had &s;ome
bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>The '&s;quire, having recollected and ad|ju&s;ted
him&s;elf, was the fir&s;t to laugh at
his own &s;ituation; but it was not without
difficulty, that Tabby's arms could be
untwi&s;ted from his neck, Liddy's teeth
chattered, and Jenkins was threatened
with a fit as u&s;ual. I had communicated
to my uncle the character of Martin, as
<PB N="91" REF="93">
it was de&s;cribed by the con&s;table, and he
was much &s;truck with its &s;ingularity&mdash;
He could not &s;uppo&s;e the fellow had any
de&s;ign on our company, which was &s;o nu|merous
and well armed; he therefore
thanked him, for the &s;ervice he had ju&s;t
done them, &s;aid he would be glad of his
company, and a&s;ked him to dine with us
at Hatfield. This invitation might not
have been agreeable to the ladies, had
they known the real profe&s;&s;ion of our
gue&s;t, but this was a &s;ecret to all, ex|cept
my uncle and my&s;elf&mdash;Mrs. Tabitha,
however, would by no means con&s;ent to
proceed with a ca&s;e of loaded pi&s;tols in
the coach, and they were forthwith di&s;|charged
in complai&s;ance to her and the
re&s;t of the women.</P>
<P>Being gratified in this particular, &s;he
became remarkably good-humoured, and
at dinner behaved in the mo&s;t affable
manner to Mr. Martin, with who&s;e po|lite
addre&s;s and agreeable conver&s;ation
&s;he &s;eemed to be much taken. After
dinner, the landlord acco&s;ting me in the
yard, a&s;ked, with a &s;ignificant look, if
the gentleman that rode the &s;orrel belong|ed
to our company?&mdash;I under&s;tood his
meaning, but an&s;wered, <HI>no;</HI> that he had
come up with us on the common, and
<PB N="92" REF="94">
helped us to drive away two fellows, that
looked like highwaymen&mdash;He nodded
three times di&s;tinctly, as much as to &s;ay,
he knows his cue. Then he inquired, if
one of tho&s;e men was mounted on a bay
mare, and the other on a che&s;nut geld|ing
with a white &s;treak down his fore|head?
and being an&s;wered in the affir|mative,
he a&s;&s;ured me they had robbed
three po&s;t-chai&s;es this very morning&mdash;I
inquired, in my turn, if Mr. Martin was
of his acquaintance; and, nodding thrice
again, he an&s;wered, that <HI>he had &s;een the
gentleman.</HI></P>
<P>Before we left Hatfield, my uncle, fix|ing
his eyes on Martin with &s;uch expre&s;|&s;ion
as is more ea&s;ily conceived than de|&s;cribed,
a&s;ked, if he often travelled that
road? and he replied with a look which
denoted his under&s;tanding the que&s;tion,
that he very &s;eldom did bu&s;ine&s;s in that
part of the country. In a word, this ad|venturer
favoured us with his company
to the neighbourhood of Stevenage, where
he took his leave of the coach and me,
in very polite terms, and turned off up|on
a cro&s;s-road, that led to a village on
the left&mdash;At &s;upper, Mrs. Tabby was ve|ry
full in the prai&s;e of Mr. Martin's good|&s;en&s;e
and good-breeding, and &s;eemed to
<PB N="93" REF="95">
regret that &s;he had not a further oppor|tunity
to make &s;ome experiment upon his
affection. In the morning, my uncle was
not a little &s;urpri&s;ed to receive, from
the waiter, a billet couched in the&s;e
words&mdash;</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>&startq;Sir,&endq;</OPENER>
<P>&startq;I could ea&s;ily perceive from your
looks, when I had the honour to con|ver&s;e
with you at Hatfield, that my
character is not unknown to you; and,
I dare &s;ay, you won't think it &s;trange,
that I &s;hould be glad to change my
pre&s;ent way of life, for any other ho|ne&s;t
occupation, let it be ever &s;o hum|ble,
that will afford me bread in mo|deration,
and &s;leep in &s;afety&mdash;Perhaps
you may think I flatter, when I &s;ay,
that from the moment I was witne&s;s to
your generous concern in the cau&s;e of
your &s;ervant, I conceived a particular
e&s;teem and veneration for your per|&s;on;
and yet what I &s;ay is true. I
&s;hould think my&s;elf happy, if I could
be admitted into your protection and
&s;ervice, as hou&s;e-&s;teward, clerk, but|ler,
or bailiff, for either of which
places I think my&s;elf tolerably well
<PB N="94" REF="96">
qualified; and, &s;ure I am, I &s;hould not
be found deficient in gratitude and
fidelity&mdash;At the &s;ame time, I am very
&s;en&s;ible how much you mu&s;t deviate
from the common maxims of di&s;cre|tion,
even in putting my profe&s;&s;ions to
the trial; but I don't look upon you
as a per&s;on that thinks in the ordinary
&s;tile; and the delicacy of my &s;ituation,
will, I know, ju&s;tify this addre&s;s to a
heart warmed with beneficence and
compa&s;&s;ion&mdash;Under&s;tanding you are
going pretty far north, I &s;hall take an
opportunity to throw my&s;elf in your
way again, before you reach the bor|ders
of Scotland; and, I hope, by that
time, you will have taken into con&s;i|deration,
the truly di&s;tre&s;sful ca&s;e of,</P>
<CLOSER>honoured &s;ir,
your very humble,
and devoted &s;ervant,
<SIGNED>EDWARD MARTIN.&endq;</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>The '&s;quire, having peru&s;ed this letter,
put it into my hand, without &s;aying a
&s;yllable; and when I had read it, we
looked at each other in &s;ilence. From a
certain &s;parkling in his eyes, I di&s;cover|ed
<PB N="95" REF="97">
there was more in his heart, than he
cared to expre&s;s with his tongue, in favour
of poor Martin; and this was preci&s;ely
my own feeling, which he did not fail to
di&s;cern, by the &s;ame means of communi|cation&mdash;&startq;What
&s;hall we do (&s;aid he) to
&s;ave this poor &s;inner from the gallows,
and make him a u&s;eful member of the
commonwealth? and yet the proverb
&s;ays, Save a thief from the gallows,
and he'll cut your throat.&endq; I told him,
I really believed Martin was capable of
giving the proverb the lie; and that I
&s;hould heartily concur in any &s;tep he
might take in favour of his &s;o$licitation.
We mutually re&s;olved to deliberate upon
the &s;ubject, and, in the mean time, pro|ceeded
on our journey. The roads, hav|ing
been broke up by the heavy rains in
the &s;pring, were &s;o rough, that although
we travelled very &s;lowly, the jolting oc|ca&s;ioned
&s;uch pain to my uncle, that he
was become exceedingly peevi&s;h when
we arrived at this place, which lies about
eight miles from the po&s;t-road, between
Wetherby and Boroughbridge.</P>
<P>Harrigate-water, &s;o celebrated for its
efficacy in the &s;curvy and other di&s;tem|pers,
is &s;upplied from a copious &s;pring,
in the hollow of a wild common, round
<PB N="96" REF="98">
which, a good many hou&s;es have been
built for the convenience of the drinkers,
though few of them are inhabited. Mo&s;t
of the company lodge at &s;ome di&s;tance,
in five &s;eparate inns, &s;ituated in different
parts of the common, from whence they
go every morning to the well, in their own
carriages. The lodgers of each inn form
a di&s;tinct &s;ociety, that eat together; and
there is a commodious public room,
where they breakfa&s;t in di&s;habille, at &s;e|parate
tables, from eight o'clock till ele|ven,
as they chance or chu&s;e to come in
&mdash;Here al&s;o they drink tea in the after|noon,
and play at cards or dance in the
evening. One cu&s;tom, however, pre|vails,
which I look upon as a &s;oleci&s;m in
politene&s;s&mdash;The ladies treat with tea in
their turns; and even girls of &s;ixteen are
not exempted from this &s;hameful impo|&s;ition&mdash;There
is a public ball by &s;ub|&s;cription
every night at one of the hou&s;es,
to which all the company from the others
are admitted by tickets; and, indeed,
Harrigate treads upon the heels of Bath,
in the articles of gaiety and di&s;&s;ipation&mdash;
with this difference, however, that here
we are more &s;ociable and familiar. One
of the inns is already full up to the very
garrets, having no le&s;s than fifty lodgers,
<PB N="97" REF="99">
and as many &s;ervants. Our family does
not exceed thirty-&s;ix; and I &s;hould be
&s;orry to &s;ee the number augmented, as
our accommodations won't admit of much
increa&s;e.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent, the company is more agree|able
than one could expect from an acci|dental
a&s;&s;emblage of per&s;ons, who are
utter &s;trangers to one another&mdash;There
&s;eems to be a general di&s;po&s;ition among
us to maintain good-fellow&s;hip, and pro|mote
the purpo&s;es of humanity, in favour
of tho&s;e who come hither on the &s;core of
health. I &s;ee &s;everal faces which we left
at Bath, although the majority are of the
Northern counties, and many come from
Scotland for the benefit of the&s;e waters&mdash;
In &s;uch a variety, there mu&s;t be &s;ome
originals, among whom Mrs. Tabitha
Bramble is not the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable&mdash;
No place where there is &s;uch an inter|cour&s;e
between the &s;exes, can be di&s;|agreeable
to a lady of her views and tem|perament&mdash;She
has had &s;ome warm di&s;|putes
at table, with a lame par&s;on from
Northumberland, on the new birth, and
the in&s;ignificance of moral virtue; and
her arguments have been reinforced by
an old Scotch lawyer, in a tye periwig,
who, though he has lo&s;t his teeth, and the

u&s;e of his limbs, can &s;till wag his tongue
with great volubility. He has paid her

he is too much a fox to be in|veigled

<OPENER>To DR. LEWIS.
DEAR DOCTOR,</OPENER>
<P>CONSIDERING the tax we pay for
turnpikes, the roads of this country con|&s;titute
a mo&s;t intolerable grievance. Be|tween
Newark and Weatherby, I have
&s;uffered more from jolting and &s;winging
than ever I felt in the whole cour&s;e of my
life, although the carriage is remarkably
commodious and well hung, and the
po&s;tilions were very careful in driving.
I am now &s;afely hou&s;ed at the New Inn,
at Harrigate, whi$$ $word$ came to &s;atisfy my
curio&s;ity, rather $word$ with any view of ad|vantage
to my health; and, truly, after hav|ing
con&s;idered all the parts and particulars
of the place, I cannot account for the con|cour&s;e
of people one finds here, upon any
other principle but that of caprice, which
&s;eems to be the character of our nation.</P>
<P>Harrigate is a wild common, bare and
bleak, without tree or &s;hrub, or the
<PB N="100" REF="102">
lea&s;t &s;igns of cultivation; and the people
who come to drink the water, are crowd|ed
together in paltry inns, where the few
tolerable rooms are monopolized by the
friends and favourites of the hou&s;e, and
all the re&s;t of the lodgers are obliged to
put up with dirty holes, where there is
neither &s;pace, air, nor convenience. My
apartment is about ten feet &s;quare; and
when the folding bed is down, there is
ju&s;t room &s;ufficient to pa&s;s between it and
the fire. One might expect, indeed, that
there would be no occa&s;ion for a fire at
Mid&s;ummer; but here the climate is &s;o
backward, that an a&s;h tree, which our
landlord has planted before my window,
is ju&s;t beginning to put forth its leaves;
and I am fain to have my bed warmed
every night.</P>
<P>As for the water, which is &s;aid to have
effected &s;o many &s;urpri&s;ing cures, I have
drank it once, and the fir&s;t draught has
cured me of all de&s;ire to repeat the medi|cine.&mdash;
Some people &s;ay it &s;mells of rotten
eggs, and others compare it to the &s;cour|ings
of a foul gun.&mdash;It is generally &s;up|po&s;ed
to be &s;trongly impregnated with
&s;ulphur; and Dr. Shaw, in his book
upon mineral waters, &s;ays, he has &s;een
flakes of &s;ulphur floating in the well.&mdash;
<PB N="101" REF="103">
<HI>Pace tanti viri;</HI> I, for my part, have never
ob&s;erved any thing like &s;ulphur, either
in or about the well, neither do I find
that any brim&s;tone has ever been extract|ed
from the water. As for the &s;mell, if
I may be allowed to judge from my own
organs, it is exactly that of bilge-water;
and the &s;aline ta&s;te of it &s;eems to declare
that it is nothing el&s;e than &s;alt water pu|trified
in the bowels of the earth. I was
obliged to hold my no&s;e with one hand,
while I advanced the gla&s;s to my mouth
with the other; and after I had made
&s;hift to &s;wallow it, my &s;tomach could
hardly retain what it had received.&mdash;The
only effects it produced were &s;ickne&s;s,
griping, and in&s;urmountable di&s;gu&s;t.&mdash;
I can hardly mention it without puking.&mdash;
The world is &s;trangely mi&s;led by the af|fectation
of &s;ingularity. I cannot help
&s;u&s;pecting, that this water owes its repu|tation
in a great mea&s;ure to its being &s;o
&s;trikingly offen&s;ive.&mdash;On the &s;ame kind
of analogy, a German doctor has intro|duced
hemlock and other poi&s;ons, as
&s;pecifics, into the <HI>materia medica.</HI>&mdash;I am
per&s;uaded, that all the cures a&s;cribed to
the Harrigate water, would have been as
efficaciou&s;ly, and infinitely more agree|ably
performed, by the internal and ex|ternal
<PB N="102" REF="104">
u&s;e of &s;ea-water. Sure I am, this
la&s;t is much le&s;s nau&s;eous to the ta&s;te and
&s;mell, and much more gentle in its opera|tion
as a purge, as well as more exten|&s;ive
in its medical qualities.</P>
<P>Two days ago, we went acro&s;s the
country to vi&s;it '&s;quire Burdock, who
married a fir&s;t cou&s;in of my father, an
heire&s;s, who brought him an e&s;tate of a
thou&s;and a year. This gentleman is a de|clared
opponent of the mini&s;try in parlia|ment;
and having an opulent fortune,
piques him&s;elf upon living in the country,
and maintaining <HI>old Engli&s;h ho&s;pitality.</HI>&mdash;
By the bye, this is a phra&s;e very much
u&s;ed by the Engli&s;h them&s;elves, both in
words and writing; but I never heard of
it out of the i&s;land, except by way of
irony and &s;arca&s;m. What the ho&s;pitality
of our fore-fathers has been I &s;hould be
glad to &s;ee recorded, rather in the me|moirs
of &s;trangers who have vi&s;ited our
country, and were the proper objects and
judges of &s;uch ho&s;pitality, than in the
di&s;cour&s;e and lucubrations of the modern
Engli&s;h, who &s;eem to de&s;cribe it from
theory and conjecture. Certain it is, we
are generally looked upon by foreigners,
as a people totally de&s;titute of this vir|tue;
and I never was in any country
<PB N="103" REF="105">
abroad, where I did not meet with per|&s;ons
of di&s;tinction, who complained of
having been inho&s;pitably u&s;ed in Great
Britain. A gentleman of France, Italy,
or Germany, who has entertained and
lodged an Engli&s;hman at his hou&s;e, when
he afterwards meets with his gue&s;t at
London, is a&s;ked to dinner at the Sara|cen's-head,
the Turk's-head, the Boar's-head,
or the Bear, eats raw beef and
butter, drinks execrable port, and is
allowed to pay his &s;hare of the reckon|ing.</P>
<P>But to return from this digre&s;&s;ion,
which my feeling for the honour of my
country obliged me to make&mdash;our
York&s;hire cou&s;in has been a mighty fox|hunter
<HI>before the Lord;</HI> but now he is too
fat and unwieldy to leap ditches and five|bar
gates; neverthele&s;s, he &s;till keeps a
pack of hounds, which are well exerci&s;ed;
$span$ every night entertains
him with the adventures of the day's
chace, which he recites in a tone and
terms that are extremely curious and &s;ig|nificant.
In the mean time, his broad
brawn is &s;cratched by one of his grooms.
&mdash;This fellow, it &s;eems, having no in|clination
to curry any bea&s;t out of the &s;ta|ble,
was at great pains to &s;collop his nails
<PB N="104" REF="106">
in &s;uch a manner that the blood followed
at every &s;troke.&mdash;He was in hopes that
he would be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from this di&s;agree|able
office, but the event turned out con|trary
to his expectation.&mdash;His ma&s;ter de|clared
he was the be&s;t &s;cratcher in the
family; and now he will not &s;uffer any
other &s;ervant to draw a nail upon his car|ca&s;e.</P>
<P>The '&s;quire's lady is very proud, with|out
being &s;tiff or inacce&s;&s;ible.&mdash;She re|ceives
even her inferiors in point of fortune
with a kind of arrogant civility; but then
&s;he thinks &s;he has a right to treat them with
the mo&s;t ungracious freedoms of &s;peech,
and never fails to let them know &s;he is
&s;en&s;ible of her own &s;uperior affluence.&mdash;
In a word, &s;he &s;peaks well of no living
&s;oul, and has not one &s;ingle friend in the
world. Her hu&s;band hates her mortally;
but, although the brute is &s;ometimes &s;o
very powerful in him that he will have
his own way, he generally truckles to her
dominion, and dreads, like a &s;chool-boy,
the la&s;h of her tongue. On the other
hand, &s;he is afraid of provoking him too
far, le&s;t he &s;hould make &s;ome de&s;perate
effort to &s;hake off her yoke.&mdash;She, there|fore,
acquie&s;ces in the proofs he daily
gives of his attachment to the liberty of
<PB N="105" REF="107">
an Engli&s;h freeholder, by &s;aying and do|ing,
at his own table, whatever gratifies
the brutality of his di&s;po&s;ition, or contri|butes
to the ea&s;e of his per&s;on. The
hou&s;e, though large, is neither elegant
nor comfortable.&mdash;It looks like a great
inn, crowded with travellers, who dine
at the landlord's ordinary, where there is
a great profu&s;ion of victuals and drink,
but mine ho&s;t &s;eems to be mi&s;placed;
and I would rather dine upon filberts with
a hermit, than feed upon veni&s;on with a
hog. The footmen might be aptly com|pared
to the waiters of a tavern, if they
were more &s;erviceable and le&s;s rapacious;
but they are generally in&s;olent and inat|tentive,
and &s;o greedy, that, I think, I
can dine better, and for le&s;s expence, at
the Star and Ga$ter in Pall mall, than at
our cou&s;in's ca&s;tle in York&s;hire. The
'&s;quire is not only accommodated with a
wife, but he is al&s;o ble&s;&s;ed with an only
&s;on, about two and twenty, ju&s;t returned
from Italy a complete fidler and <HI>dillet|tante;</HI>
and he &s;lips no opportunity of
manife&s;ting the mo&s;t perfect contempt
for his own father.</P>
<P>When we arrived, there was a family
of foreigners at the hou&s;e, on a vi&s;it to
this virtuo&s;o, with whom they had been
<PB N="106" REF="108">
acquainted at the Spa: it was the count
de Melville, with his lady, on their way
to Scotland. Mr. Burdock had met with
an accident, in con&s;equence of which
both the count and I would have retired,
but the young gentleman and his mother
in&s;i&s;ted upon our &s;taying dinner; and
their &s;erenity &s;eemed to be &s;o little ruf|fled
by what had happened, that we com|plied
with their invitation. The '&s;quire
had been brought home over night in his
po&s;t-chai&s;e, &s;o terribly belaboured about
the pate, that he &s;eemed to be in a &s;tate
of &s;tupefaction, and had ever &s;ince re|mained
&s;peechle&s;s. A country apothe|cary,
called Grieve, who lived in a
neighbouring village, having been called
to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, had let him blood, and
applied a poulti$e to his head, declaring,
that he had no fever, nor any other bad
&s;ymptom but the lo&s;s of &s;peech, if he
really had lo&s;t that faculty. But the
young '&s;quire &s;aid this practitioner was an
<HI>ignorantaccio,</HI> that there was a fracture
in the <HI>cranium,</HI> and that there was a ne|ce&s;&s;ity
for having him trepanned without
lo&s;s of time. His mother, e&s;pou&s;ing this
opinion, had &s;ent an expre&s;s to York for
a &s;urgeon to perform the operation, and
he was already come with his 'prentice
and in&s;truments. Having examined the
<PB N="107" REF="109">
patient's head, he began to prepare his
dre&s;&s;ings; though Grieve &s;till retained his
fir&s;t opinion that there was no fracture,
and was the more confirmed in it as the
'&s;quire had pa&s;&s;ed the night in profound
&s;leep, uninterrupted by any catching or
convul&s;ion. The York &s;urgeon &s;aid he
could not tell whether there was a frac|ture,
until he &s;hould take off the &s;calp;
but, at any rate, the operation might be
of &s;ervice in giving vent to any blood that
might be extrava&s;ated, either above or
below the <HI>dura mater.</HI> The lady and her
&s;on were clear for trying the experiment;
and Grieve was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with &s;ome
marks of contempt, which, perhaps, he
owed to the plainne&s;s of his appearance.
He &s;eemed to be about the middle age,
wore his own black hair without any &s;ort
of dre&s;&s;ing; by his garb, one would have
taken him for a quaker, but he had none
of the &s;tiffne&s;s of that &s;ect, on the contra|ry,
he was very &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, re&s;pectful, and
remarkably taciturn.</P>
<P>Leaving the ladies in an apartment by
them&s;elves, we adjourned to the patient's
chamber, where the dre&s;&s;ings and in&s;tru|ments
were di&s;played in order upon a
powter di&s;h. The operator, laying a&s;ide
his coat and peri$vig, equipped him&s;elf
<PB N="108" REF="110">
with a night-cap, apron, and &s;leeves,
while his 'prentice and footman, &s;eizing
the '&s;quire's head, began to place it in a
proper po&s;ture.&mdash;But mark what fol|lowed.&mdash;
The patient, bolting upright in
the bed, collared each of the&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tants
with the gra&s;p of Hercules, exclaiming,
in a bellowing tone, &startq;I ha'n't lived &s;o
long in York&s;hire to be trepanned by
&s;uch vermin as you;&endq; and leaping on
the floor, put on his breeches quietly, to
the a&s;toni&s;hment of us all. The &s;urgeon
&s;till in&s;i&s;ted upon the operation, alledging
it was now plain that the brain was in|jured,
and de&s;iring the &s;ervants to put
him $nto bed again; but no body would
venture to execute his orders, or even
to interpo&s;e: when the '&s;quire turned
him and his a&s;&s;i&s;tants out of doors, and
threw his apparatus out at the window.
Having thus a&s;&s;erted his prerogative, and
pu$ on his cloaths with the help of a va|let,
the count, with my nephew and me,
were introduced by his &s;on, and received
with his u&s;ual &s;tile of ru&s;tic civility; then
turning to &s;ignor Macaroni, with a farca&s;|tic
gr$n, &startq;I tell thee what, Dick, (&s;aid
he) a man's &s;cull is not to be bored
every time his head is broken; and I'll
convince thee and thy mother, that I
<PB N="109" REF="111">
know as many tricks as e'er an old fox
in the We&s;t Riding.&endq;</P>
<P>We afterwards under&s;tood he had quar|relled
at a public hou&s;e with an exci&s;e|man,
whom he challenged to a bout
at &s;ingle &s;tick, in which he had been
wor&s;ted; and that the &s;hame of this de|feat
had tied up his tongue. As for ma|dam,
&s;he had &s;hewn no concern for his
di&s;a&s;ter, and now heard of his recovery
without emotion&mdash;She had taken &s;ome
little notice of my &s;i&s;ter and niece, though
rather with a view to indulge her own
petulance, than out of any &s;entiment of
regard to our family.&mdash;She &s;aid Liddy
was a fright, and ordered her woman to
adju&s;t her head before dinner; but &s;he
would not meddle with Tabby, who&s;e
&s;pirit, &s;he &s;oon perceived, was not to be
irritated with impunity. At table, &s;he
acknowledged me &s;o far as to &s;ay &s;he had
heard of my father; though &s;he hinted,
that he had di&s;obliged her family by
making a poor match in Wales. She
was di&s;agreeably familiar in her enquiries
about our circum&s;tances; and a&s;ked, if I
intended to bring up my nephew to the
law. I told her, that, as he had an inde|pendent
fortune, he &s;hould follow no
profe&s;&s;ion but that of a country gentle|man;
<PB N="110" REF="112">
and that I was not without hopes
of procuring for him a &s;eat in parliament.
&mdash;&startq;Pray, cou&s;in, (&s;aid &s;he) what may
his fortune be?&endq; When I an&s;wered,
that, with what I &s;hould be able to give
him, he would have better than two
thou&s;and a year, &s;he replied, with a di&s;|dainful
to&s;s of her head, that it would
be impo&s;&s;ible for him to pre&s;erve his in|dependence
on &s;uch a paltry provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>Not a little nettled at this arrogant re|mark,
I told her, I had the honour to &s;it
in parliament with her father, when he
had little more than half that income;
and I believed there was not a more in|dependent
and incorruptible member in
the hou&s;e. &startq;Ay; but times are changed,
(cried the '&s;quire)&mdash;Country gentlemen
now-a days live after another fa&s;hion.
&mdash;My table alone &s;tands me in a cool
thou&s;and a quarter, though I rai&s;e my
own &s;tock, import my own liquors,
and have every thing at the fir&s;t hand.
&mdash;True it is, I keep open hou&s;e, and
receive all comers, for the honour of
Old England.&endq; &startq;If that be the ca&s;e,
(&s;aid I) 'tis a wonder you can maintain
it at &s;o &s;mall an expence; but every
private gentleman is not expected to
keep a <HI>caravan&s;era</HI> for the accommoda|tion
<PB N="111" REF="113">
of travellers: indeed, if every in|dividual
lived in the &s;ame &s;tile, you
would not have &s;uch a number of
gue&s;ts at your table, of con&s;equence
your ho&s;pitality would not &s;hine &s;o
bright for the glory of the We&s;t Rid|ing.&endq;
The young '&s;quire, tickled by
this ironical ob&s;ervation, exclaimed, &startq;<HI>O
che burla!</HI>&endq;&mdash;his mother eyed me in
&s;ilence with a &s;upercilious air; and the
father of the fea&s;t, taking a bumper of
October, &startq;My &s;ervice to you, cou&s;in
Bramble, (&s;aid he) I have always heard
there was &s;omething keen and biting in
the air of the Welch mountains.&endq;</P>
<P>I was much plea&s;ed with the count de
Melville, who is &s;en&s;ible, ea&s;y, and po|lite;
and the counte&s;s is the mo&s;t amiable
woman I ever beheld. In the afternoon
they took leave of their entertainers, and
the young gentleman, mounting his hor&s;e,
undertook to conduct their coach through
the park, while one of their &s;ervants rode
round to give notice to the re&s;t, whom
they had left at a public hou&s;e on the
road. The moment their backs were
turned, the cen&s;orious daemon took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of our York&s;hire landlady and our
&s;i&s;ter Tabitha.&mdash;The former ob&s;erved,
that the counte&s;s was a good &s;ort of a
<PB N="112" REF="114">
body, but totally ignorant of good breed|ing,
con&s;equently aukward in her addre&s;s.
The '&s;quire &s;aid he did not pretend to the
breeding of any thing but colts; but
that the jade would be very hand&s;ome, if
&s;he was a little more in fle&s;h. &startq;Hand|&s;ome!
(cried Tabby) &s;he has indeed a
pair of black eyes without any mean|ing;
but then there is not a good fea|ture
in her face.&endq; &startq;I know not what
you call good features in Wales; (re|plied
our landlord) but they'll pa&s;s in
York&s;hire.&endq; Then turning to Liddy,
he added, &startq;What &s;ay you, my pretty
Red&s;treak?&mdash;what is your opinion of
the counte&s;s?&endq; &startq;I think (cried Lid|dy,
with great emotion) &s;he's an angel.&endq;
Tabby chid her for talking with &s;uch
freedom in company; and the lady of
the hou&s;e &s;aid, in a contemptuous t$ne,
&s;he &s;uppo&s;ed mi&s;s had been brought up
at &s;ome country boarding-&s;chool.</P>
<P>Our conver&s;ation was &s;uddenly inter|rupted
by the young gentleman, who
galloped into the yard all agha&s;t, ex|claiming,
that the coach was attacked by
a great number of highwaymen. My ne|phew
and I $word$ out, found his own
and his &s;ervant's hor&s;e ready &s;addled in the
&s;table, with pi&s;tols in the caps.&mdash;We
<PB N="113" REF="115">
mounted in&s;tantly, ordering Clinker and
Dutton to follow with all po&s;&s;ible expedi|tion;
but notwith&s;tanding all the &s;peed
we could make, the action was over be|fore
we arrived, and the count with his
lady, &s;afe lodged at the hou&s;e of Grieve,
who had &s;ignalized him&s;elf in a very re|markable
manner on this occa&s;ion. At
the turning of a lane, that led to the vil|lage
where the count's &s;ervants remained,
a couple of robbers a-hor&s;eback &s;uddenly
appeared, with their pi&s;tols advanced:
one kept the coachman in awe, and the
other demanded the count's money, while
the young '&s;quire went off at full &s;peed,
without ever ca&s;ting a look behind. The
count de&s;iring the thief to withdraw his
pi&s;tol, as the lady was in great terror, de|livered
his pur&s;e without making the lea&s;t
re&s;i&s;tance; but not &s;atisfied with this
booty, which was pretty con&s;iderable,
the ra&s;cal in&s;i&s;ted upon rifling her of her
ear-rings and necklace, and the counte&s;s
&s;creamed with affright. Her hu&s;band,
exa&s;perated at the violence with which
&s;he was threatened, wre&s;ted the pi&s;tol out
of the fellow's hand, and turning it upon
him, &s;napped it in his face; but the rob|ber
knowing there was no charge in it,
drew another from his bo&s;om, and in all
<PB N="114" REF="116">
probability would have killed him on the
&s;pot, had not his life been &s;aved by a won|derful
interpo&s;ition. Grieve, the apotheca|ry,
chancing to pa&s;s that very in&s;tant, ran
up to the coach, and with a crab-&s;tick,
which was all the weapon he had, brought
the fellow to the ground with the fir&s;t blow;
then &s;eizing his pi&s;tol, pre&s;ented it to his
colleague, who fired his piece at random,
and fled without further oppo&s;ition. The
other was &s;ecured by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the
count and the coachman; and his legs
being tied under the belly of his own
hor&s;e. Grieve conducted him to the vil|lage&punc;
whither al&s;o the carriage proceeded.
It was with great difficulty the counte&s;s
could be kept from &s;wooning; but at
la&s;t &s;he was happily conveyed to the hou&s;e
of the apothecary, who went into the &s;hop
to prepare &s;ome drops for her, while his
wife and daughter admini&s;tered to her in
another apartment.</P>
<P>I found the count &s;tanding in the kitchen
with the par&s;on of the pari&s;h, and expre&s;&s;ing
much impatience to &s;ee his protector,
whom as yet he had &s;carce found time to
thank for the e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice he had done
him and the counte&s;s.&mdash;The daughter
pa&s;&s;ing at the &s;ame time with a gla&s;s of
water, mon&s;ieur de Melville could not
<PB N="115" REF="117">
help taking notice of her figure, which
was &s;trikingly engaging.&mdash;&startq;Ay, (&s;aid the
par&s;on) &s;he is the prettie&s;t girl, and
the be&s;t girl in all my pari&s;h; and if
I could give my &s;on an e&s;tate of ten
thou&s;and a year, he &s;hould have my
con&s;ent to lay it at her feet. If Mr.
Grieve had been as &s;ollicitous about
getting money, as he has been in per|forming
all the duties of a primitive
Chri&s;tian, Fy would not have hung &s;o
long upon his hands.&endq; &startq;What is her
name?&endq; &s;aid I. &startq;Sixteen years ago
(an&s;wered the vicar) I chri&s;tened her by
the names of Seraphina Melvilia.&endq;
&startq;Ha! what! how! (cried the count
eagerly) &s;ure, you &s;aid Seraphina Mel|vilia.&endq;
&startq;I did; (&s;aid he) Mr. Grieve
told me tho&s;e were the names of two
noble per&s;ons abroad, to whom he had
been obliged for more than life.&endq;</P>
<P>The count, without &s;peaking another
&s;yllable, ru&s;hed into the parlour, crying,
&startq;This is your god-daughter, my dear.&endq;
Mrs. Grieve, then &s;eizing the counte&s;s by
the hand, exclaimed with great agitation,
&startq;O madam!&mdash;O &s;ir!&mdash;I am&mdash;I am your
poor Elinor.&mdash;This is my Seraphina
Melvilia.&mdash;O child! the&s;e are the
count and counte&s;s of Melville, the
<PB N="116" REF="118">
generous&mdash;the glorious benefactors of
thy once unhappy parents.&endq;</P>
<P>The counte&s;s ri&s;ing from her &s;eat,
threw her arms about the neck of the
amiable Seraphina, and cla&s;ped her to
her brea&s;t with great tenderne&s;s, while
&s;he her&s;elf was embraced by the weeping
mother. This moving &s;cene was com|pleted
by the entrance of Grieve him&s;elf,
who falling on his knees before the count,
&startq;Behold (&s;aid he) a penitent, who at
length can look upon his patron with|out
&s;hrinking.&endq; &startq;Ah, Ferdinand!
(cried he, rai&s;ing and folding him in
his arms) the play-fellow of my infan|cy&mdash;the
companion of my youth!&mdash;
Is it to you then I am indebted for my
life?&endq; &startq;Heaven has heard my pray|er,
(&s;aid the other) and given me an
opportunity to prove my&s;elf not alto|gether
unworthy of your clemency and
protection.&endq; He then ki&s;&s;ed the hand
of the counte&s;s, while mon&s;ieur de Mel|ville
&s;aluted his wife and lovely daughter,
and all of us were greatly affected by this
pathetic recognition.</P>
<P>In a word, Grieve was no other than
Ferdinand count Fathom, who&s;e adven|tures
were printed many years ago. Be|ing
a &s;incere convert to virtue, he had
<PB N="117" REF="119">
changed his name, that he might elude
the enquiries of the count, who&s;e generous
allowance he determined to forego, that
he might have no dependence but upon
his own indu&s;try and moderation. He
had accordingly &s;ettled in this village as a
practitioner in &s;urgery and phy&s;ic, and
for &s;ome years wre&s;tled with all the mi&s;e|ries
of indigence, which, however, he
and his wife had borne with the mo&s;t ex|emplary
re&s;ignation. At length, by dint
of unwearied attention to the duties of his
profe&s;&s;ion, which he exerci&s;ed with equal
humanity and &s;ucce&s;s, he had acquired a
tolerable &s;hare of bu&s;ine&s;s among the
farmers and common people, which ena|bled
him to live in a decent manner. He
had been &s;carce ever &s;een to &s;mile; was
unaffectedly pious; and all the time he
could &s;pare from the avocations of his
employment he &s;pent in educating his
daughter, and in &s;tudying for his own
improvement.&mdash;In &s;hort, the adventurer
Fathom was, under the name of Grieve,
univer&s;ally re&s;pected among the common|alty
of this di&s;trict, as a prodigy of learn|ing
and virtue. The&s;e particulars I
learned from the vicar, when we quitted
the room, that they might be under no re|&s;traint
in their mutual effu&s;ions. I make
<PB N="118" REF="120">
no doubt that Grieve will be pre&s;&s;ed to
leave off bu&s;ine&s;s, and re-unite him&s;elf to
the count's family; and as the counte&s;s
&s;eemed extremely fond of his daughter,
&s;he will, in all probability, in&s;i&s;t upon Se|raphina's
accompanying her to Scotland.</P>
<P>Having paid our compliments to the&s;e
noble per&s;ons, we returned to the '&s;quire's,
where we expected an invitation to pa&s;s the
night, which was wet and raw; but, it
&s;eems, '&s;quire Burdock's ho&s;pitality reach|ed
not &s;o far for the honour of York&s;hire:
we therefore departed in the evening, and
lay at an inn, where I caught cold.</P>
<P>In hope of riding it down before it
could take fa&s;t hold on my con&s;titution,
I re&s;olved to vi&s;it another relation, one
Mr. Pimpernel, who lived about a dozen
miles from the place where we lodged.
Pimpernel being the younge&s;t of four
&s;ons, was bred an attorney at Furnival's-inn;
but all his elder brothers dying, he
got him&s;elf called to the bar for the ho|nour
of his family, and &s;oon after this
preferment, &s;ucceeded to his father's e&s;tate,
which was very con&s;iderable. He carried
home with him all the knavi&s;h chicanery
of the lowe&s;t pettifogger, together with a
wife whom he had purcha&s;ed of a d$ay|man
for twenty pounds; and he &s;oon
<PB N="119" REF="121">
found means to obtain a <HI>Dedimus</HI> as an
acting ju&s;tice of peace. He is not only
a &s;ordid mi&s;er in his di&s;po&s;ition, but his
avarice is mingled with a &s;pirit of de&s;po|ti&s;m,
which is truly diabolical.&mdash;He is a
brutal hu&s;band, an unnatural parent, a
har&s;h ma&s;ter, an oppre&s;&s;ive landlord, a li|tigious
neighbour, and a partial magi|&s;trate.&mdash;
Friends he has none; and in
point of ho&s;pitality and good breeding,
our cou&s;in Burdock is a prince in com|pari&s;on
of this ungracious mi&s;creant,
who&s;e hou&s;e is the lively repre&s;entation of
a gaol. Our reception was &s;uitable to the
character I have &s;ketched. Had it de|pended
upon the wife, we &s;hould have
been kindly treated.&mdash;She is really a good
&s;ort of a woman, in &s;pite of her low ori|ginal,
and well re&s;pected in the county;
but &s;he has not intere&s;t enough in her
own hou&s;e to command a draught of ta|ble-beer,
far le&s;s to be&s;tow any kind of
education on her children, who run about,
like ragged colts, in a &s;tate of nature.&mdash;
Pox on him! he is &s;uch a dirty fellow,
that I have not patience to pro&s;ecute the
&s;ubject.</P>
<P>By that time we reached Harrigate, I
began to be vi&s;ited by certain rheumatic
&s;ymptoms. The Scotch lawyer, Mr.
<PB N="120" REF="122">
Micklewhimmen, recommended a hot
bath of the&s;e waters &s;o earne&s;tly, that I
was over-per&s;uaded to try the experi|ment.&mdash;
He had u&s;ed it often with &s;ucce&s;s,
and always &s;tayed an hour in the bath,
which was a tub filled with Harrigate
water, heated for the purpo&s;e. If I could
hardly bear the &s;mell of a &s;ingle tumbler
when cold, you may gue&s;s how my no&s;e
was regaled by the &s;teams ari&s;ing from a
hot bath of the &s;ame fluid. At night, I
was conducted into a dark hole on the
ground floor, where the tub &s;moaked and
&s;tunk like the pot of Acheron, in one
corner, and in another &s;tood a dirty bed
provided with thick blankets, in which
I was to &s;weat after coming out of the
bath. My heart &s;eemed to die within me
when I entered this di&s;mal bagnio, and
found my brain a&s;&s;aulted by &s;uch in&s;uffer|able
effluvia.&mdash;I cur&s;ed Micklewhimmen
for not con&s;idering that my organs were
formed on this &s;ide of the Tweed; but
being a&s;hamed to recoil upon the thre|&s;hold,
I &s;ubmitted to the proce&s;s.</P>
<P>After having endured all but real &s;uffo|cation
for above a quarter of an hour in
the tub, I was moved to the bed and
wrapped in blankets.&mdash;There I lay a full
hour panting with intolerable heat; but
<PB N="121" REF="123">
not the lea&s;t moi&s;ture appearing on my
&s;kin, I was carried to my own chamber,
and pa&s;&s;ed the night without clo&s;ing an
eye, in &s;uch a flutter of &s;pirits as render|ed
me the mo&s;t mi&s;erable wretch in be|ing.
I &s;hould certainly have run di&s;tract|ed,
if the rarefaction of my blood, occa|&s;ioned
by that Stygian bath, had not bur&s;t
the ve&s;&s;els, and produced a violent hae|morrhage,
which, though dreadful and
alarming, removed the horrible di&s;quiet.
&mdash;I lo&s;t two pounds of blood, and more,
on this occa&s;ion; and find my&s;elf &s;till
weak and languid; but, I believe, a little
exerci&s;e will forward my recovery; and
therefore I am re&s;olved to &s;et out to mor|row
for York, in my way to Scarbo|rough,
where I propo&s;e to brace up my
fibres by &s;ea-bathing, which, I know, is
one of your favourite &s;pecifics. There is;
however, one di&s;ea&s;e, for which you have
found as yet no &s;pecific, and that is old
age, of which this tedious unconnected
epi&s;tle is an infallible &s;ymptom:&mdash;<HI>what,</HI>

<LETTER>
<PB N="122" REF="124">
<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bart. of
Je&s;us college, Oxon.
DEAR KNIGHT,</OPENER>
<P>THE manner of living at Harrigate
was &s;o agreeable to my di&s;po&s;ition, that I
left the place with &s;ome regret&mdash;Our aunt
Tabby would have probably made &s;ome
objection to our departing &s;o &s;oon, had
not an accident embroiled her with Mr.
Micklewhimmen, the Scotch advocate,
on who&s;e heart &s;he had been practi&s;ing,
from the &s;econd day after our arrival&mdash;
That original, though &s;eemingly preclud|ed
from the u&s;e of his limbs, had turned
his genius to good account&mdash;In &s;hort, by
dint of groaning, and whining, he had ex|cited
the compa&s;&s;ion of the company &s;o
effectually, that an old lady, who occu|pied
the very be&s;t apartment in the hou&s;e,
gave it up for his ea&s;e and convenience.
When his man led him into the Long
Room, all the females were immediately
in commotion&mdash;One &s;et an elbow-chair;
<PB N="123" REF="125">
another &s;hook up the cu&s;hion; a third
brought a &s;tool; and a fourth a pillow,
for the accommodation of his feet&mdash;Two
ladies (of whom Tabby was always one)
&s;upported him into the dining-room, and
placed him properly at the table; and
his ta&s;te was indulged with a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
of delicacies, culled by their fair hands.
All this attention he repaid with a pro|fu&s;ion
of compliments and benedictions,
which were not the le&s;s agreeable for be|ing
delivered in the Scotti&s;h dialect. As
for Mrs. Tabitha, his re&s;pects were parti|cularly
addre&s;&s;ed to her, and he did not
fail to mingle them with religious reflec|tions,
touching free grace, knowing her
bia&s;s to methodi&s;m, which he al&s;o pro|fe&s;&s;ed
upon a calvini&s;tical model.</P>
<P>For my part, I could not help think|ing
this lawyer was not &s;uch an invalid as
he pretended to be. I ob&s;erved he ate
very heartily three times a-day; and
though his bottle was marked <HI>&s;tomachic
tincture,</HI> he had recour&s;e to it &s;o often,
and &s;eemed to &s;wallow it with &s;uch pecu|liar
reli&s;h, that I &s;u&s;pected it was not
compounded in the apothecary's &s;hop, or
the chemi&s;t's laboratory. One day, while
he was earne&s;t in di&s;cour&s;e with Mrs.
Tabitha, and his &s;ervant had gone out
<PB N="124" REF="126">
on &s;ome occa&s;ion or other, I dexterou&s;ly
exchanged the labels, and &s;ituation of his
bottle and mine; and having ta&s;ted his
tincture, found it was excellent claret.
I forthwith handed it about to &s;ome of
my neighbours, and it was quite emptied
before Mr. Micklewhimmen had occa&s;ion
to repeat his draught. At length, turn|ing
about, he took hold of my bottle,
in&s;tead of his own, and, filling a large
gla&s;s, drank to the health of Mrs. Tabi|tha&mdash;
It had &s;carce touched his lips, when
he perceived the change which had been
put upon him, and was at fir&s;t a little out
of countenance&mdash;He &s;eemed to retire
within him&s;elf, in order to deliberate,
and in half a minute his re&s;olution was
taken; addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to our quarter,
&startq;I give the gentleman cradit for his wit
(&s;aid he); it was a gude practical joke;
but &s;ometimes <HI>hi joci in &s;eria ducunt ma|la</HI>&mdash;I
hope for his own &s;ake he has na
drank all the liccor; for it was a vara
poorful infu&s;ion of jallap in Bourdeaux
wine; at its po&s;&s;able he may ha ta'en
&s;ic a do&s;e as will produce a terrible
cata&s;trophe in his ain booels&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>By far the greater part of the contents
had fallen to the &s;hare of a young clo|thier
from Leeds, who had come to make
<PB N="125" REF="127">
a figure at Harrigate, and was, in effect
a great coxcomb in his way. It was with
a view to laugh at his fellow-gue&s;ts, as
well as to mortify the lawyer, that he had
emptied the bottle, when it came to his
turn, and he had laughed accordingly:
but now his mirth gave way to his appre|hen&s;ion&mdash;He
began to &s;pit, to make wry
faces, and writhe him&s;elf into various
contor&s;ions&mdash;&startq;Damn the &s;tuff! (cried
he) I thought it had a villanous twang
&mdash;pah! He that would cozen a Scot,
mun get oop betimes, and take Old
Scratch for his coun&s;ellor&mdash;&endq; &startq;In
troth me&s;ter what d'ye ca'um, (replied
the lawyer) your wit has run you into a
filthy puddle&mdash;I'm truly con&s;$rned for
your waeful ca&s;e&mdash;The be&s;t advice I
can give you, in &s;ic a delemma, is to
&s;end an expre&s;s to Rippon for doctor
Waugh, without delay, and, in the
mean time, &s;wallow all the oil and but|ter
you can find in the hoo&s;e, to de|fend
your poor &s;tomach and inta&s;tins
from the villication of the particles of
the jallap, which is vara violent, even
when taken in moderation.&endq;</P>
<P>The poor clothier's torments had al|ready
begun: he retired, roaring with
pain, to his own chamber; the oil was
<PB N="126" REF="128">
&s;wallowed, and the doctor &s;ent for; but
before he arrived, the mi&s;erable patient
had made &s;uch di&s;charges upwards and
downwards, that nothing remained to
give him further offence; and this dou|ble
evacuation, was produced by imagi|nation
alone; for what he had drank
was genuine wine of Bourdeaux, which
the lawyer had brought from Scotland
for his own private u&s;e. The clothier,
finding the joke turn out &s;o expen&s;ive
and di&s;agreeable, quitted the hou&s;e next
morning, leaving the triumph to Mickle|whimmen,
who enjoyed it internally,
without any outward &s;igns of exultation
&mdash;on the contrary, he affected to pity
the young man for what he had &s;uffered;
and acquired fre&s;h credit from this &s;hew
of moderation.</P>
<P>It was about the middle of the night,
which &s;ucceeded this adventure, that the
$ent of the kitchen chimney being foul,
the &s;oot took fire, and the alarm was
given in a dreadful manner&mdash;Every body
leaped naked out of bed, and in a mi|nute
the whole hou&s;e was filled with cries
and confu&s;ion&mdash;There were two &s;tairs in
the hou&s;e, and to the&s;e we naturally ran;
but they were both &s;o blocked up, by the
people pre&s;&s;ing one upon another, that it
<PB N="127" REF="129">
&s;eemed impo&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s, without throw|ing
down and trampling upon the women.
In the mid&s;t of this anarchy, Mr. Mickle|whimmen,
with a leathern portmanteau
on his back, came running as nimble as
a buck along the pa&s;&s;age; and Tabby,
in her under-petticoat, endeavouring to
hook him under the arm, that &s;he might
e&s;cape through his protection, he very
fairly pu&s;hed her down, crying, &startq;Na,
na, gude faith, charity begins at hame!&endq;
Without paying the lea&s;t re&s;pect to the
&s;hrieks and intreaties of his female friends,
he charged through the mid&s;t of the
crowd, overturning every thing that op|po&s;ed
him; and actually fought his way
to the bottom of the &s;tair-ca&s;e&mdash;By this
time Clinker had found a ladder, by which
he entered the window of my uncle's
chamber, where our family was a&s;&s;em|bled,
and propo&s;ed that we &s;hould make
our exit &s;ucce&s;&s;ively by that conveyance.
The '&s;quire exhorted his &s;i&s;ter to begin
the de&s;cent; but, before &s;he could re|&s;olve,
her woman, Mrs. Winifred Jen|kins,
in a tran&s;port of terror, threw
her&s;elf out at the window upon the
ladder, while Humphry dropped upon
the ground, that he might receive
her in her de&s;cent&mdash;This maiden
<PB N="128" REF="130">
was ju&s;t as &s;he had &s;tarted out of bed,
the moon &s;hone very bright, and a fre&s;h
breeze of wind blowing, none of Mrs.
Winifred's beauties could po&s;&s;ibly e&s;cape
the view of the fortunate Clinker, who&s;e
heart was not able to with&s;tand the united
force of &s;o many charms; at lea&s;t, I am
much mi&s;taken, if he has not been her
humble &s;lave from that moment&mdash;He re|ceived
her in his arms, and, giving her
his coat to protect her from the weather,
a&s;cended again with admirable dexte|rity.</P>
<P>At that in&s;tant, the landlord of the
hou&s;e called out with an audible voice,
that the fire was extingui&s;hed, and the
ladies had nothing further to fear: this
was a welcome note to the audience, and
produced an immediate effect; the &s;hriek|ing
cea&s;ed, and a confu&s;ed &s;ound of ex|po&s;tulation
en&s;ued. I conducted Mrs.
Tabitha and my &s;i&s;ter to their own cham|ber,
where Liddy fainted away; but was
&s;oon brought to her&s;elf. Then I went to
offer my &s;ervices to the other ladies, who
might want a&s;&s;i&s;tance&mdash;They were all
&s;cudding through the pa&s;&s;age to their &s;e|veral
apartments; and as the thoroughfair
was lighted by two lamps, I had a pret|ty
good ob&s;ervation of them in their tran|&s;it;
<PB N="129" REF="131">
but as mo&s;t of them were naked to
the &s;mock, and all their heads &s;hrowded
in huge night-caps, I could not di&s;tingui&s;h
one face from another, though I recog|nized
&s;ome of their voices&mdash;The&s;e were
generally plaintive; &s;ome wept, &s;ome
&s;colded, and &s;ome prayed&mdash;I lifted up
one poor old gentlewoman, who had been
overturned and &s;ore brui&s;ed by a multi|tude
of feet; and this was al&s;o the ca&s;e
with the lame par&s;on from Northumber|land,
whom Micklewhimmen had in his
pa&s;&s;age overthrown, though not with im|punity,
for the cripple, in falling, gave
him &s;uch a good pelt on the head with
his crutch, that the blood followed.</P>
<P>As for this lawyer, he waited below till
the hurly burly was over, and then &s;tole
&s;oftly to his own chamber, from whence
he did not venture to make a &s;econd &s;al|ly
till eleven in the forenoon, when he was
led into the Public Room by his own &s;er|vant
and another a&s;&s;i&s;tant, groaning mo&s;t
woefully, with a bloody napkin round
his head. But things were greatly altered
&mdash;The &s;elfi&s;h brutality of his behaviour
on the &s;tairs had &s;teeled their hearts again&s;t
all his arts and addre&s;s&mdash;Not a &s;oul of|fered
to accommodate him with chair,
cu&s;hion, or foot&s;tool; &s;o that he was ob|liged
<PB N="130" REF="132">
to &s;it down on a hard wooden
bench&mdash;In that po&s;ition, he looked a|round
with a rueful a&s;pect, and, bowing
very low, &s;aid in a whining tone, &startq;Your
mo&s;t humble &s;ervant, ladies&mdash;Fire is
a dreadful calamity&mdash;&endq; &startq;Fire puri|fies
gold, and it tries friend&s;hip.&endq;
cried Mrs. Tabitha, bridling. &startq;Yea,
madam (replied Micklewhimmen);
and it trieth di&s;cretion al&s;o&mdash;&endq; &startq;If
di&s;cretion con&s;i&s;ts in for&s;aking a friend
in adver&s;ity, you are eminently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed
of that virtue.&endq; re&s;umed our aunt&mdash;
Na, madam, (rejoined the advocate)
well I wot, I cannot claim any merit
from the mode of my retreat&mdash;Ye'll
plea&s;e to ob&s;erve ladies, there are twa
independent principles that actuate
our nature&mdash;One is in&s;tinct, which we
have in common with the brute crea|tion,
and the other is rea&s;on&mdash;Noo, in
certain great emergencies, when the
faculty of rea&s;on is &s;u&s;pended, in&s;tinct
taks the lead, and when this predo|minates,
having no affinity with rea|&s;on,
it pays no &s;ort of regard to its
connections; it only operates for the
pre&s;ervation of the individual, and that
by the mo&s;t expeditious and effectual
means; therefore, begging your par|don,
<PB N="131" REF="133">
ladies, I'm no accountable in <HI>foro
con&s;cientiae,</HI> for what I did, while un|der
the influence of this irre&s;i&s;tible
pooer.&endq;</P>
<P>Here my uncle interpo&s;ing, &startq;I &s;hould
be glad to know, (&s;aid he) whether it
was in&s;tinct that prompted you to re|treat
with bag and baggage; for, I
think, you had a portmanteau on your
&s;houlder&mdash;&endq; The lawyer an&s;wered,
without he&s;itation, &startq;Gif I might tell my
mind freely, withoot incuring the &s;u&s;|picion
of pre&s;umption, I &s;hould think
it was &s;omething &s;uperior to either rea|&s;on
or in&s;tinct which &s;ugge&s;ted that
mea&s;ure, and this on a twafald ac|coont:
in the fir&s;t place, the port|manteau
contained the writings of a
worthy nobleman's e&s;tate; and their
being burnt would have occa&s;ioned a
lo&s;s that could not be repaired; &s;e|condly,
my good angel &s;eems to have
laid the portmantle on my &s;houlders, by
way of defence, to &s;u&s;tain the violence
of a mo&s;t inhuman blow, from the
crutch of a reverend clergyman;
which, even in &s;pite of that medium,
hath wounded me &s;orely, even unto
the pericranium.&endq; &startq;By your own
doctrine, (cried the par&s;on, who chanced
<PB N="132" REF="134">
to be pre&s;ent) I am not accountable
for the blow, which was the effect of
in&s;tinct.&endq; &startq;I crave your pardon, re|verend
&s;ir, (&s;aid the other) in&s;tinct ne|ver
acts but for the pre&s;ervation of the
individual; but your pre&s;ervation was
out of the ca&s;e&mdash;you had already re|ceived
the damage, and therefore the
blow mu&s;t be imputed to revenge,
which is a &s;inful pa&s;&s;ion, that ill be|comes
any Chri&s;tian, e&s;pecially a pro|te&s;tant
divine; and let me tell you,
mo&s;t reverend doctor, gin I had a|mind
to plea, the law would hauld
my libel relevant.&endq; &startq;Why, the da|mage
is pretty equal on both &s;ides
(cried the par&s;on); your head is broke,
and my crutch is &s;napt in the middle
&mdash;Now, if you will repair the one, I
will be at the expence of curing the
other.&endq;</P>
<P>This &s;ally rai&s;ed the laugh again&s;t
Micklewhimmen, who began to look
grave; when my uncle, in order to
change the di&s;cou&s;e, ob&s;erved, that in|&s;tinct
had been very kind to him in an|other
re&s;pect; for it had re&s;tored to him
the u&s;e of his limbs, which, in his exit,
he had moved with &s;urpri&s;ing agility.&mdash;
He replied, that it was the nature of fear
<PB N="133" REF="135">
to brace up the nerves; and mentioned
&s;ome &s;urpri&s;ing feats of &s;trength and ac|tivity
performed by per&s;ons under the
impul&s;e of terror; but he complained,
that in his own particular, the effects
had cea&s;ed when the cau&s;e was taken
away&mdash;The '&s;quire &s;aid, he would lay a
tea-drinking on his head, that he &s;hould
dance a Scotch mea&s;ure, without making
a fal&s;e &s;tep; and the advocate grinning,
called for the piper&mdash;A fiddler being at
hand, this original &s;tarted up, with his
bloody napkin over his black tye-peri|wig,
and acquitted him&s;elf in &s;uch a man|ner
as exerted the mirth of the whole
company; but he could not regain the
good graces of Mrs. Tabby, who did not
under&s;tand the principle of in&s;tinct; and
the lawyer did not think it worth his while
to proceed to further demon&s;tration.</P>
<P>From Harrigate, we came hither, by
the way of York, and here we &s;hall tar|ry
&s;ome days, as my uncle and Tabitha
are both re&s;olved to make u&s;e of the
waters. Scarborough, though a paltry
town, is romantic from its &s;ituation along
a cliff that over-hangs the &s;ea The bar|bour
is formed by a &s;mall elbow of land
that runs out as a natural mole, directly
oppo&s;ite to the town; and on that &s;ide is
<PB N="134" REF="136">
the ca&s;tle, which &s;tands very high, of
con&s;iderable extent, and, before the in|vention
of gun-powder, was counted im|pregnable.
At the other end of Scar|borough
are two public rooms for the
u&s;e of the company, who re&s;ort to this
place in the &s;ummer, to drink the waters
and bathe in the &s;ea; and the diver&s;ions
are pretty much on the &s;ame footing here
as at Bath. The Spa is a little way be|yond
the town, on this &s;ide, under a cliff,
within a few paces of the &s;ea, and thither
the drinkers go every morning in di&s;ha|bille;
but the de&s;cent is by a great num|ber
of &s;teps, which invalids find very in|convenient.
Betwixt the well and the
harbour, the bathing machines are ran|ged
along the beach, with all their pro|per
uten&s;ils and attendants&mdash;You have
never &s;een one of the&s;e machines&mdash;Image
to your&s;elf a &s;mall, &s;nug, wooden cham|ber,
fixed upon a wheel-carriage, having
a door at each end, and on each &s;ide a
little window above, a bench below&mdash;
The bather, a&s;cending into this apart|ment
by wooden &s;teps, &s;huts him&s;elf in,
and begins to undre&s;s, while the atten|dant
yokes a hor&s;e to the end next the
&s;ea, and draws the carriage forwards, till
the &s;urface of the water is on a level with
<PB N="135" REF="137">
the floor of the dre&s;&s;ing-room, then he
moves and fixes the hor&s;e to the other
end&mdash;The per&s;on within, being &s;tripped,
opens the door to the &s;ea-ward, where he
finds the guide ready, and plunges head|long
into the water&mdash;After having
bathed, he re-a&s;cends into the apart|ment,
by the &s;teps which had been &s;hift|ed
for that purpo&s;e, and puts on his
clothes at his lei&s;ure, while the carriage
is drawn back again upon the dry land;
&s;o that he has nothing further to do, but
to open the door, and come down as he
went up&mdash;Should he be &s;o weak or ill as
to require a &s;ervant to put off and on his
clothes, there is room enough in the a|partment
for half a dozen people. The
guides who attend the ladies in the wa|ter,
are of their own &s;ex, and they and
the female bathers have a dre&s;s of flan|nel
for the &s;ea; nay, they are provided
with other conveniences for the &s;upport
of decorum. A certain number of the ma|chines
are fitted with tilts, that project
from the &s;ea-ward ends of them, &s;o as to
&s;creen the bathers from the view of all
per&s;ons what&s;oever&mdash;The beach is admir|ably
adapted for this practice, the de&s;cent
being gently gradual, and the &s;and &s;oft
as velvet; but then the machines can be
<PB N="136" REF="138">
u&s;ed only at a certain time of the tide,
which varies every day; &s;o that &s;ome|times
the bathers are obliged to ri&s;e very
early in the morning&mdash;For my part, I
love &s;wimming as an exerci&s;e, and can
enjoy it at all times of the tide, without
the formality of an apparatus&mdash;You and
I have often plunged together into the
I&s;is; but the &s;ea is a much more noble
bath, for health as well as plea&s;ure. You
cannot conceive what a flow of &s;pirits it
gives, and how it braces every &s;inew of
the human frame. Were I to enumerate
half the di&s;ea&s;es which are every day cured
by &s;ea-bathing, you might ju&s;tly &s;ay you

<PB N="137" REF="139">
<OPENER>To Dr. LEWIS.</OPENER>
<P>I HAVE not found all the benefit I
expected at Scarborough, where I have
been the&s;e eight days&mdash;From Harrigate
we came hither by the way of York,
where we &s;tayed only one day to vi&s;it the
Ca&s;tle, the Min&s;ter, and the A&s;&s;embly-room.
The fir&s;t, which was heretofore a fortre&s;s,
is now converted to a pri&s;on, and is the
be&s;t, in all re&s;pects, I ever &s;aw at home
or abroad&mdash;It &s;tands in a high &s;ituation,
extremely well ventilated; and has a &s;pa|cious
area within the walls, for the health
and convenience of all the pri&s;oners, ex|cept
tho&s;e whom it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure
in clo&s;e confinement&mdash;Even the&s;e la&s;t
have all the comforts that the nature of
their &s;ituation can admit. Here the
a&s;&s;izes are held, in a range of buildings
erected for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>As for the Min&s;ter, I know not how to
di&s;tingui&s;h it, except by its great &s;ize and
the height of its &s;pire, from tho&s;e other
<PB N="138" REF="140">
antient churches in different parts of the
kingdom, which u&s;ed to be called mo|numents
of Gothic architecture; but it is
now agreed, that this &s;tile is Saracen ra|ther
than Gothic; and, I &s;uppo&s;e, it was
fir&s;t imported into England from Spain,
great part of which was under the domi|nion
of the Moors. Tho&s;e Briti&s;h archi|tects,
who adopted this &s;tile, don't &s;eem
to have con&s;idered the propriety of their
adoption. The climate of the country,
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Moors or Saracens, both
in Africa and Spain, was &s;o exceedingly
hot and dry, that tho&s;e who built places
of wor&s;hip for the multitude, employed
their talents in contriving edifices that
&s;hould be cool; and, for this purpo&s;e,
nothing could be better adopted than
tho&s;e buildings; va&s;t, narrow, dark, and
lo&s;ty, impervious to the &s;un beams, and
having little communication with the
&s;corched external atmo&s;phere; but ever
affording a refre&s;hing coolne&s;s, like &s;ub|terranean
cellars in the heats of &s;ummer,
or natural caverns in the bowels of huge
mountains. But nothing could be more
prepo&s;terous, than to imitate &s;uch a mode
of architecture in a country like Eng|land,
where the climate is cold, and the
air eternally loaded with vapours; and
<PB N="139" REF="141">
where, of con&s;equence, the builder's in|tention
&s;hould be to keep the people dry
and warm&mdash;For my part, I never entered
the Abbey church at Bath but once, and
the moment I &s;tept over the thre&s;hold, I
found my&s;elf chilled to the very marrow
of my bones&mdash;When we con&s;ider, that
in our churches, in general, we breathe a
gro&s;s &s;tagnated air, &s;urcharged with
damps from vaults, tombs, and charnel|hou&s;es,
may we not term them &s;o many
magazines of rheums, created for the be|nefit
of the medical faculty? and &s;afely
aver, that more bodies are lo&s;t, than
&s;ouls &s;aved, by going to church, in the
winter e&s;pecially, which may be &s;aid to
engro&s;s eight months in the year. I
&s;hould be glad to know, what offence it
would give to tender con&s;ciences, if the
hou&s;e of God was made more comfort|able,
or le&s;s dangerous to the health of
valetudinarians; and whether it would
not be an encouragement to piety, as well
as the &s;alvation of many lives, if the
place of wor&s;hip was well floored, wain|&s;cotted,
warmed, and ventilated, and its
area kept &s;acred from the pollution of the
dead. The practice of burying in
churches was the effect of ignorant &s;u|per&s;tition,
influenced by knavi&s;h prie&s;ta,
<PB N="140" REF="142">
who pretended that the devil could have
no power over the defunct, if he was in|terred
in holy ground; and this, indeed,
is the only rea&s;on that can be given for
con&s;ecrating all cemeteries, even at this
day.</P>
<P>The external appearance of an old ca|thedral
cannot be but di&s;plea&s;ing to the
eye of every man, who has any idea of
propriety and proportion, even though he
may be ignorant of architecture as a
&s;cience; and the long &s;lender &s;pire puts
one in mind of a criminal impaled, with
a &s;harp &s;take ri&s;ing up through his
&s;houlder&mdash;The&s;e towers, or &s;teeples, were
likewi&s;e borrowed from the Mahometans;
who, having no bells, u&s;ed &s;uch mina|rets
for the purpo&s;e of calling the people
to prayers&mdash;They may be of further u&s;e,
however, for making ob&s;ervations and
&s;ignals; but I would vote for their be|ing
di&s;tinct from the body of the church,
becau&s;e they &s;erve only to make the pile
more barbarous, or Saracencial.</P>
<P>There is nothing of this Arabic archi|tecture
in the A&s;&s;embly Room, which
&s;eems to me to have been built upon a de|&s;ign
of Palladio, and might be converted
into an elegant place of wor&s;hip; but it
is indifferently contrived for that &s;ort of
<PB N="141" REF="143">
idolatry which is performed in it at pre|&s;ent:
the grandeur of the fane gives a
diminutive effect to the little painted di|vinities
that are adored in it, and the
company, on a ball-night, mu&s;t look like
an a&s;&s;embly of fanta&s;tic fairies, revelling
by moon-light among the columns of a
Grecian temple.</P>
<P>Scarborough &s;eems to be falling off, in
point of reputation&mdash;All the&s;e places
(Bath excepted) have their vogue, and
then the fa&s;hion changes&mdash;I am per&s;uad|ed,
there are fifty &s;paws in England as
efficacious and &s;alutary as that of Scar|borough,
though they have not yet ri&s;en
to fame; and, perhaps, never will, un|le&s;s
&s;ome medical encomia&s;t &s;hould find
an intere&s;t in di&s;playing their virtues to
the public view&mdash;Be that as it may, re|cour&s;e
will always be had to this place
for the convenience of &s;ea-beathing, while
this practice prevails; but it were to be
wi&s;hed, they would make the beach more
acce&s;&s;ible to invalids.</P>
<P>I have here met with my old acquain|tance,
H&mdash;t, whom you have often
heard me mention as one of the mo&s;t
original characters upon earth&mdash;I fir&s;t
knew him at Venice, and afterwards &s;aw
him in different parts of Italy, where he
<PB N="142" REF="144">
was well known by the nick-name of Ca|vallo
Bianco, from his appearing always
mounted on a pale hor&s;e, like Death in
the Revelations. You mu&s;t remember
the account I once gave you of a curious
di&s;pute he had at Con&s;tantinople, with a
couple of Turks, in defence of the Chri|&s;tian
religion; a di&s;pute from which he
acquired the epithet of Demon&s;trator&mdash;
The truth is, H&mdash;owns no religion
but that of nature; but, on this occa&s;ion,
he was &s;timulated to &s;hew his parts, for
the honour of his country&mdash;Some years
ago, being in the Campidoglio at Rome,
he made up to the bu&s;t of Jupiter, and,
bowing very low, exclaimed in the Italian
language, &startq;I hope, &s;ir, if ever you get
your head above water again, you will
remember that I paid my re&s;pects to
you in your adver&s;ity.&endq; This &s;ally was
reported to the cardinal Camerlengo, and
by him laid before pope Benedict XIV.
who could not help laughing at the ex|travagance
of the addre&s;s, and &s;aid to the
cardinal, &startq;Tho&s;e Engli&s;h heretics think
they have a right to go to the devil in
their own way.&endq;</P>
<P>Indeed H&mdash;was the only Engli&s;h|man
I ever knew, who had re&s;olution
enough to live in his own way, in the
<PB N="143" REF="145">
mid&s;t of foreigners; for, neither in dre&s;s,
diet, cu&s;toms, or conver&s;ation, did he
deviate one tittle from the manner in
which he had been brought up. About
twelve years ago, he began a Giro or cir|cuit,
which he thus performed&mdash;At Na|ples,
where he fixed his head-quarters,
he embarked for Mar&s;eilles, from whence
he travelled with a Voiturin to Antibes&mdash;
There he took his pa&s;&s;age to Genoa and
Lerici; from which la&s;t place he pro|ceeded,
by the way of Cambratina, to Pi&s;a
and Florence&mdash;After having halted &s;ome
time in this metropolis, he &s;et out with a
Vetturino for Rome, where he repo&s;ed
him&s;elf a few weeks, and then continued
his route for Naples, in order to wait for
the next opportunity of embarkation&mdash;
After having twelve times de&s;cribed this
circle, he lately flew off at a tangent to
vi&s;it &s;ome trees at his country-hou&s;e in
England, which he had planted above
twenty years ago, after the plan of the
double colonnade in the piazza of St.
Peter's at Rome&mdash;He came hither to
Scarborough, to pay his re&s;pects to his
noble friend and former pupil, the M&mdash;
of G&mdash;, and, forgetting that he is now
turned of &s;eventy, &s;acrificed &s;o liberally
to Bacchus, that next day he was &s;eized
<PB N="144" REF="146">
a fit of the apoplexy, which has a little
impaired his memory; but he retains all
the oddity of his character in perfection,
and is going back to Italy, by the way
of Geneva, that he may have a confe|rence
with his friend Voltaire, about giv|ing
the la&s;t blow to the Chri&s;tian &s;uper|&s;tition&mdash;He
intends to take &s;hipping here
for Holland or Hamburgh; for it is a
matter of great indifference to him at
what part of the continent he fir&s;t
lands.</P>
<P>When he was going abroad the la&s;t
time, he took his pa&s;&s;age in a &s;hip bound
for Leghorn, and his baggage was actu|ally
embarked. In going down the river
by water, he was by mi&s;take put on board
of another ve&s;&s;el under &s;ail; and, upon
inquiry, under&s;tood &s;he was bound to
Peter&s;burgh&mdash;&startq;Peter&s;burgh,&mdash;Peter&s;|burgh&mdash;(&s;aid he)
I don't care if I go
along with you.&endq; He forthwith &s;truck
a bargain with the captain; bought a
couple of &s;hirts of the mate, and was
&s;afe conveyed to the court of Mu&s;covy,
from whence he travelled by land to re|ceive
his baggage at Leghorn&mdash;He is
now more likely than ever to execute a
whim of the &s;ame nature; and I will hold
any wager, that as he cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed
<PB N="145" REF="147">
to live much longer, according to the
cour&s;e of nature, his exit will be as odd
as his life has been extravagant<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">This gentleman cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea to France, vi&s;ited and con$erred with Mr. de Voltaire at Fernay, re|&s;umed his old circuit at Genoa, and died in 1767, at the hou&s;e of Vanini in Florence. Being taken with a &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of urine, he re&s;olved, in imitation of Pomponius Atticus, to take him&s;elf off by ab&s;tinence; and this re&s;olution he executed like an ancient Ro|man. He &s;aw company to the la&s;t, cracked his jokes, conver&s;ed freely, and entertained his gue&s;ts with mu&s;ic. On the third day of his fa&s;t, he found him|&s;elf entirely freed of his complaint; but refu&s;ed tak|ing &s;u&s;tenance. He &s;aid the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable part of the voyage was pa&s;t, and he &s;hould be a cur&s;ed fool indeed, to put about &s;hip, when he was ju&s;t entering the harbour. In the&s;e &s;entiments he per&s;i&s;ted, with|out any marks of affectation, and thus fini&s;hed his cour&s;e with &s;uch ea&s;e and &s;erenity, as would have done honour to the firme&s;t Stoic of antiquity.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But, to return from one humori&s;t to
another; you mu&s;t know I have received
benefit, both from the chaly beate and the
&s;ea, and would have u&s;ed them longer,
had not a mo&s;t ridiculous adventure, by
making me the town-talk, obliged me to
leave the place; for I can't bear the
thoughts of affording a &s;pectacle to the
multitude&mdash;Ye&s;terday morning, at &s;ix
o'clock, I went down to the bathing-place,
attended by my &s;ervant Clinker,
who waited on the beach as u&s;ual&mdash;The
wind blowing from the north, and the
<PB N="146" REF="148">
weather being hazy, the water proved &s;o
chill, that when I ro&s;e from my fir&s;t
plunge, I could not help &s;obbing and
bawling out, from the effects of the cold.
Clinker, who heard me cry, and &s;aw me
indi&s;tinctly a good way without the guide,
buffeting the waves, took it for granted
I was drowning, and ru&s;hing into the &s;ea,
clothes and all, overturned the guide in
his hurry to &s;ave his ma&s;ter. I had &s;wam
out a few &s;trokes, when hearing a noi&s;e,
I turned about and &s;aw Clinker, already
up to his neck, advancing towards me,
with all the wildne&s;s of terror in his a|&s;pect&mdash;
Afraid he would get out of his
depth, I made ha&s;te to meet him, when,
all of a &s;udden, he &s;eized me by one ear,
and dragged me bellowing with pain up|on
the dry beach, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of
all the people, men, women, and chil|dren
there a&s;&s;embled.</P>
<P>I was &s;o exa&s;perated by the pain of my
ear, and the di&s;grace of being expo&s;ed in
&s;uch an attitude, that, in the fir&s;t tran|&s;port,
I &s;truck him down; then, run|ning
back into the &s;ea, took &s;helter in the
machine where my clothes had been de|po&s;ited.
I &s;oon recollected my&s;elf &s;o far
as to do ju&s;tice to the poor fellow, who,
in great &s;implicity of heart, had acted
<PB N="147" REF="149">
from motives of fidelity and affection&mdash;
Opening the door of the machine, which
was immediately drawn on &s;hore, I &s;aw
him &s;tanding by the wheel, dropping like
a water-work, and trembling from head
to foot; partly from cold, and partly
from the dread of having offended his
ma&s;ter&mdash;I made my acknowledgments for
the blow he had received, a&s;&s;ured him I
was not angry, and in&s;i&s;ted upon his go|ing
home immediately, to &s;hift his
clothes; a command which he could
hardly find in his heart to execute, &s;o
well di&s;po&s;ed was he to furni&s;h the mob
with further entertainment at my ex|pence.
Clinker's intention was laudable
without all doubt, but, neverthele&s;s, I
am a &s;ufferer by his &s;implicity&mdash;I have
had a burning-heat, and a &s;trange buz|zing

<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bar^t. of
Je&s;us college, Oxon.
DEAR WATT,</OPENER>
<P>WE made a precipitate retreat from
Scarborough, owing to the exce&s;&s;ive de|licacy
of our '&s;quire, who cannot bear the
thoughts of being <HI>praetereuntium digito
mon&s;tratus.</HI></P>
<P>One morning, while he was bathing in
the &s;ea, his man Clinker took it in his
head that his ma&s;ter was in danger of
drowning; and, in this conceit, plung|ing
into the water, he lugged him out
naked on the beach, and almo&s;t pulled
off his ear in the operation. You may
gue&s;s how this atchievement was reli&s;h|ed
by Mr. Bramble, who is impatient,
ira&s;cible, and has the mo&s;t extravavant
ideas of decency and decorum in the
oeconomy of his own per&s;on&mdash;In the fir&s;t
ebullition of his choler, he knocked
Clinker down with his fi&s;t; but he after|wards
made him amends for this outrage,
<PB N="149" REF="151">
and, in order to avoid the further notice
of the people, among whom this incident
had made him remarkable, he re&s;olved
to leave Scarborough next day.</P>
<P>We &s;et out accordingly over the
moors, by the way of Whitby, and be|gan
our journey betimes, in hopes of
reaching Stockton that night; but in this
hope we were di&s;appointed&mdash;In the after|noon,
cro&s;&s;ing a deep gutter, made by a
torrent, the coach was &s;o hard &s;trained,
that one of the irons, which connect the
frame, &s;napt, and the leather &s;ling on the
&s;ame &s;ide, cracked in the middle&mdash;The
&s;hock was &s;o great, that my &s;i&s;ter Liddy
&s;truck her head again&s;t Mrs. Tabitha's
no&s;e with &s;uch violence that the blood
flowed; and Win Jenkins was darted
through a &s;mall window, in that part of
the carriage next the hor&s;es, where &s;he
&s;tuck like a bawd in the pillory, till &s;he
was relea&s;ed by the hand of Mr. Bram|ble.
We were eight miles di&s;tant from
any place where we could be &s;upplied
with chai&s;es, and it was impo&s;&s;ible to
proceed with the coach, until the da|mage
&s;hould be repaired&mdash;In this dilem|ma,
we di&s;covered a black-&s;mith's forge
on the edge of a &s;mall common, about
half a mile from the &s;cene of our di&s;a&s;ter,
<PB N="150" REF="152">
and thither the po&s;tilions made &s;hift to
draw the carriage &s;lowly, while the com|pany
walked a-foot; but we found the
black-&s;mith had been dead &s;ome days;
and his wife, who had been lately deli|vered,
was deprived of her &s;en&s;es, under
the care of a nur&s;e, hired by the pari&s;h.
We were exceedingly mortified at this
di&s;appointment, which, however, was
&s;urmounted by the help of Humphry
Clinker, who is a &s;urpri&s;ing compound
of genius and &s;implicity. Finding the
tools of the defunct, together with &s;ome
coals in the &s;mithy, he un&s;crewed the
damaged iron in a twinkling, and,
kindling a fire, united the broken pieces
with equal dexterity and di&s;patch&mdash;While
he was at work upon this operation, the
poor woman in the &s;traw, &s;truck with the
well-known &s;ound of the hammer and
anvil, &s;tarted up, and, notwith&s;tanding
all the nur&s;e's efforts, came running into
the &s;mithy, where, throwing her arms a|bout
Clinker's neck, &startq;Ah, Jacob!
(cried &s;he) how could you leave me in
&s;uch a condition?&endq;</P>
<P>This incident was too pathetic to oc|ca&s;ion
mirth&mdash;it brought tears into the
eyes of all pre&s;ent. The poor widow was
put to bed again; and we did not leave
<PB N="151" REF="153">
the village without doing &s;omething for
her benefit&mdash;Even Tabitha's charity was
awakened on this occa&s;ion. As for the
tender-hearted Humphry Clinker, he
hammered the iron and wept at the &s;ame
time&mdash;But his ingenuity was not confined
to his own province of farrier and black|&s;mith&mdash;it
was nece&s;&s;ary to join the
leather &s;ling, which had been broke; and
this &s;ervice he likewi&s;e performed, by
means of a broken awl, which he new-pointed
and ground, a little hemp,
which he &s;pun into lingels, and a few
tacks which he made for the purpo&s;e&mdash;
Upon the whole, we were in a condition
to proceed in little more than one hour;
but even this delay obliged us to pa&s;s the
night at Gi&s;borough&mdash;Next day we cro&s;&s;|ed
the Tees at Stockton, which is a neat
agreeable town; and there we re&s;olved to
dine, with purpo&s;e to lie at Durham.</P>
<P>Whom &s;hould we meet in the yard,
when we alighted, but Martin the adven|turer?
Having handed out the ladies,
and conducted them into an apartment,
where he payed his compliments to Mrs.
Tabby, with his u&s;ual addre&s;s, he beg|ged
leave to &s;peak to my uncle in another
room; and there, in &s;ome confu&s;ion, he
made an apology for having taken the
<PB N="152" REF="154">
liberty to trouble him with a letter at
Stevenage. He expre&s;&s;ed his hope, that
Mr. Bramble had be&s;towed &s;ome con&s;ider|ation
on his unhappy ca&s;e, and repeated
his de&s;ire of being taken into his &s;er|vice.</P>
<P>My uncle, calling me into the room,
told him, that we were both very well in|clined
to re&s;cue him from a way of life
that was equally dangerous and di&s;ho|nourable;
and that he &s;hould have no
&s;cruples in tru&s;ting to his gratitude and
fidelity, if he had any employment for
him, which he thought would &s;uit his
qualifications and his circum&s;tances; but
that all the departments he had men|tioned
in his letter, were filled up by per|&s;ons
of who&s;e conduct he had no rea&s;on
to complain; of con&s;equence he could
not, without inju&s;tice, deprive any one
of them of his bread&mdash;Neverthele&s;s, he
declared him&s;elf ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in
any fea&s;ible project, either with his pur&s;e
or credit.</P>
<P>Martin &s;eemed deeply touched at this
declaration&mdash;The tear &s;tarted in his eye,
while he &s;aid, in a faultering accent&mdash;
&startq;Worthy &s;ir&mdash;your genero&s;ity oppre&s;&s;es
me&mdash;I never dreamed of troubling you
for any pecuniary a&s;&s;i&s;tance&mdash;indeed I
<PB N="153" REF="155">
have no occa&s;ion&mdash;I have been &s;o lucky
at billiards and betting in different
places, at Buxton, Harrigate, Scar|borough,
and Newca&s;tle races, that
my &s;tock in ready-money amounts to
three hundred pounds, which I would
willingly employ, in pro&s;ecuting &s;ome
hone&s;t &s;cheme of life; but my friend,
ju&s;tice Buzzard, has &s;et &s;o many
&s;prings for my life, that I am under
the nece&s;&s;ity of either retiring imme|diately
to a remote part of the coun|try,
where I can enjoy the protection
of &s;ome generous patron, or of quit|ting
the kingdom altogether&mdash;It is
upon this alternative that I now beg
leave to a&s;k your advice&mdash;I have had
information of all your route, &s;ince I
had the honour to &s;ee you at Steven|age;
and, &s;uppo&s;ing you would come
this way from Scarborough, I came
hither la&s;t night from Darlington, to
pay you my re&s;pects.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It would be no difficult matter to
provide you with an a&s;ylum in the
country (replied my uncle); but a life
of indolence and ob&s;curity would not
&s;uit with your active and enterprizing
di&s;po&s;ition&mdash;I would therefore advi&s;e
you to try your fortune in the Ea&s;t Indies
<PB N="154" REF="156">
&mdash;I will give you a letter to a friend in
London, who will recommend you to
the direction, for a commi&s;&s;ion in the
company's &s;ervice; and if that cannot
be obtained, you will at lea&s;t be re|ceived
as a volunteer&mdash;in which ca&s;e,
you may pay for your pa&s;&s;age, and I
&s;hall undertake to procure you &s;uch
credentials, that you will not be long
without a commi&s;&s;ion.&endq;</P>
<P>Martin embraced the propo&s;al with
great eagerne&s;s; it was therefore re&s;olv|ed,
that he &s;hould &s;ell his hor&s;e, and
take a pa&s;&s;age by &s;ea for London, to ex|ecute
the project without delay&mdash;In the
mean time he accompanied us to Dur|ham,
where we took up our quarters for
the night&mdash;Here, being furni&s;hed with
letters from my uncle, he took his leave
of us, with &s;trong &s;ymptoms of gratitude
and attachment, and &s;et out for Sunder|land,
in order to embark in the fir&s;t col|lier,
bound for the river Thames. He
had not been gone half an hour, when
we were joined by another character,
which promi&s;ed &s;omething extraordinary
&mdash;A tall, meagure figure, an&s;wering,
with his hor&s;e, the de&s;cription of Don
Quixote mounted on Rozinante, ap|peared
in the twilight at the inn door,
<PB N="155" REF="157">
while my aunt and Liddy &s;tood at a win|dow
in the dining-room&mdash;He wore a coat,
the cloth of which had once been &s;car|let,
trimmed with Brandenburgs, now
totally deprived of their metal, and he
had hol&s;ter-caps and hou&s;ing of the &s;ame
&s;tuff and &s;ame antiquity. Perceiving la|dies
at the window above, he endeavour|ed
to di&s;mount with the mo&s;t graceful air
he could a&s;&s;ume; but the o&s;tler neglect|ing
to hold the &s;tirrup when he wheeled
off his right foot, and &s;tood with his
whole weight on the other, the girth un|fortunately
gave way, the &s;addle turned,
down came the cavalier to the ground,
and his hat and periwig falling off, di&s;|played
a head-piece of various colours,
patched and plai&s;tered in a woeful condi|tion&mdash;
The ladies, at the window above,
&s;hrieked with affright, on the &s;uppo&s;ition
that the &s;tranger had received &s;ome not|able
damage in his fall; but the greate&s;t
injury he had &s;u&s;tained aro&s;e from the
di&s;honour of his de&s;cent, aggravated by
the di&s;grace of expo&s;ing the condition of
his cranium; for certain plebeians that
were about the door, laughed aloud, in
the belief that the captain had got either
a &s;cald head, or a broken head, both
equally opprobrious.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="158">
He forthwith leaped up in a fury, and
&s;natching one of his pi&s;tols, threatened to
put the o&s;tler to death, when another
&s;quall from the women checked his re|&s;entment.
He then bowed to the win|dow,
while he ki&s;&s;ed the butt-end of his
pi&s;tol, which he replaced; adju&s;ted his
wig in great confu&s;ion, and led his hor&s;e
into the &s;table&mdash;By this time I had come
to the door, and could not help gazing
at the &s;trange figure that pre&s;ented it&s;elf
to my view&mdash;He would have mea&s;ured
above &s;ix feet in height, had he &s;tood
upright; but he &s;tooped very much; was
very narrow in the &s;houlders, and very
thick in the calves of his legs, which
were ca&s;ed in black &s;patterda&s;hes&mdash;As for
his thighs, they were long and &s;lender,
like tho&s;e of a gra&s;shopper; his face was,
at lea&s;t, half a yard in length, brown and
&s;hrivelled, with projecting cheek-bones,
little grey eyes on the greeni&s;h hue, a
large hook-no&s;e, a pointed chin, a mouth
from ear to ear, very ill furni&s;hed with
teeth, and a high, narrow fore-head,
well furrowed with wrinkles. His hor&s;e
was exactly in the &s;tile of its rider; a re|&s;urrection
of dry bones, which (as we af|terwards
learned) he valued exceeding|ly,
<PB N="157" REF="159">
as the only pre&s;ent he had ever receiv|ed
in his life.</P>
<P>Having &s;een this favourite &s;teed pro|perly
accommodated in the &s;table, he
&s;ent up his compliments to the ladies,
begging permi&s;&s;ion to thank them in per|&s;on
for the marks of concern they had
&s;hewn at his di&s;a&s;ter in the court-yard&mdash;
As the '&s;quire &s;aid they could not de|&s;ently
decline his vi&s;it, he was &s;hewn up
&s;tairs, and paid his re&s;pects in the Scotch
dialect, with much formality&mdash;&startq;Lad|dies,
(&s;aid he) perhaps ye may be &s;can|daleezed
at the appearance my heed
made, when it was uncovered by acci|dent;
but I can a&s;&s;ure you, the con|dition
you &s;aw it in, is neither the ef|fects
of di&s;ea&s;e, nor of drunkenne&s;s;
but an hone&s;t &s;car received in the &s;er|vice
of my country.&endq; He then gave
us to under&s;tand, that having been
wounded at Ticonderoga, in America, a
party of Indians rifled him, &s;calped him,
broke his &s;cull with the blow of a toma|hawk,
and left him for dead on the field
of battle; but that being afterwards
found with &s;igns of life, he had been
cured in the French ho&s;pital, though the
lo&s;s of &s;ub&s;tance could not be repaired; &s;o
<PB N="158" REF="160">
that the &s;cull was left naked in &s;everal
places, and the&s;e he covered with patches.</P>
<P>There is no hold by which an Engli&s;h|man
is &s;ooner taken than that of com|pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;We
were immediately intere&s;ted
in behalf of this veteran&mdash;Even Tabby's
heart was melted; but our pity was
warmed with indignation, when we learn|ed,
that in the cour&s;e of two &s;anguinary
wars, he had been wounded, maimed,
mutilated, taken, and en&s;laved, without
ever having attained a higher rank than
that of lieutenant&mdash;My uncle's eyes
gleamed, and his nether lip quivered,
while he exclamed, &startq;I vow to God, &s;ir,
your ca&s;e is a reproach to the &s;ervice
&mdash;The inju&s;tice you have met with is
&s;o flagrant&mdash;&endq; &startq;I mu&s;t crave
your pardon, &s;ir, (cried the other, in|terrupting
him) I complain of no in|ju&s;tice&mdash;
I purcha&s;ed an en&s;igncy thirty
years ago; and, in the cour&s;e of &s;er|vice,
ro&s;e to be a lieutenant, accord|ing
to my &s;eniority&mdash;&endq; &startq;But in &s;uch
a length of time, (re&s;umed the '&s;quire)
you mu&s;t have &s;een a great many
young officers put over your head&mdash;&endq;
&startq;Neverthele&s;s, (&s;aid he) I have no cau&s;e
to murmur&mdash;They bought their pre|ferment
with their money&mdash;I had no
<PB N="159" REF="161">
money to carry to market&mdash;that was
my misfortune; but no body was to
blame&mdash;&endq; &startq;What! no friend to ad|vance
a &s;um of money?&endq; (&s;aid Mr.
Bramble) &startq;Perhaps, I might have bor|rowed
money for the purcha&s;e of a
company (an&s;wered the other); but
that loan mu&s;t have been refunded;
and I did not chu&s;e to incumber my|&s;elf
with a debt of a thou&s;and pounds,
to be payed from an income of ten
&s;hillings a-day.&endq; &startq;So you have &s;pent
the be&s;t part of your life, (cried Mr.
Bramble) your youth, your blood, and
your con&s;titution, amid&s;t the dangers,
the difficulties, the horrors and hard|&s;hips
of war, for the con&s;ideration of
three or four &s;hillings a-day&mdash;a con&s;i|deration&mdash;&endq;
&startq;Sir, (replied the Scot,
with great warmth) you are the man
that does me inju&s;tice, if you &s;ay or

&s;uch paultry con&s;ideration&mdash;I am a
gentleman; and entered the &s;ervice as
other gentlemen do, with &s;uch hopes

effects &s;ufficient to defray the expence
of my burial.&endq;</P>
<P>My uncle a&s;&s;ured him, he had no in|tention
to give him the lea&s;t offence, by
the ob&s;ervations he had made; but, on
the contrary, &s;poke from a &s;entiment of
friendly regard to his intere&s;t&mdash;The lieu|tenant
thanked him with a &s;tiffne&s;s of ci|vility,
which nettled our old gentleman,
who perceived that his moderation was
all affected; for, what&s;oever his tongue
might declare, his whole appearance de|noted
di&s;&s;atisfaction&mdash;In &s;hort, without
pretending to judge of his military merit,
I think I may affirm, that this Caledoni|an
is a &s;elf-conceited pedant, aukward,
rude, and di&s;putacious&mdash;He has had the
benefit of a &s;chool-education, &s;eems to
have read a good number of books, his
memory is tenacious, and he pretends
to &s;peak &s;everal different languages; but
he is &s;o addicted to wrangling, that he
will cavil at the cleare&s;t truths, and, in
the pride of argumentation, attempt to
reconcile contradictions&mdash;Whether his
addre&s;s and qualifications are really of

</LETTER>
<LETTER>
<PB N="162" REF="164">
<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bar^t. of
Je&s;us college, Oxon.
DEAR PHILLIPS,</OPENER>
<P>IN my la&s;t I treated you with a high
flavoured di&s;h, in the character of the
Scotch lieutenant, and I mu&s;t pre&s;ent him
once more for your entertainment. It
was our fortune to feed upon him the
be&s;t part of three days; and I do not
doubt that he will &s;tart again in our way
before we &s;hall have fini&s;hed our nor|thern
excur&s;ion. The day after our
meeting with him at Durham proved &s;o
tempe&s;tous that we did not choo&s;e to
proceed on our journey; and my uncle
per&s;uaded him to &s;tay till the weather
&s;hould clear up, giving him, at the &s;ame
time, a general invitation to our me&s;s.
The man has certainly gathered a whole
budget of &s;hrewd ob&s;ervations, but he
brings them forth in &s;uch an ungracious
manner as would be extremely di&s;gu&s;ting,
if it was not marked by that charac|teri&s;tic
<PB N="163" REF="165">
oddity which never fails to at|tract
the attention.&mdash;He and Mr. Bram|ble
di&s;cour&s;ed, and even di&s;puted, on dif|ferent
&s;ubjects in war, policy, the belles
lettres, law, and metaphy&s;ics; and &s;ome|times
they were warmed into &s;uch alter|cation
as &s;eemed to threaten an abrupt
di&s;&s;olution of their &s;ociety; but Mr.
Bramble &s;et a guard over his own ira&s;ci|bility,
the more vigilantly as the officer
was his gue&s;t; and when, in &s;pite of all
his efforts, he began to wax warm, the
other prudently cooled in the &s;ame pro|portion.</P>
<P>Mrs. Tabitha chancing to acco&s;t her
brother by the familiar diminutive of
Matt, &startq;Pray, &s;ir, (&s;aid the lieutenant)
is your name Matthias?&endq; You mu&s;t
know, it is one of our uncle's foibles to
be a&s;hamed of his name Matthew, be|cau&s;e
it is puritanical; and this que&s;tion
chagrined him &s;o much, that he an&s;wered,
&startq;No, by G&mdash;d!&endq; in a very abrupt
tone of di&s;plea&s;ure.&mdash;The Scot took um|brage
at the manner of his reply, and
bri&s;tling up, &startq;If I had known (&s;aid he)
that you did not care to tell your name,
I &s;hould not have a&s;ked the que&s;tion&mdash;
The leddy called you Matt, and I na|turally
thought it was Matthias:&mdash;
<PB N="164" REF="166">
perhaps, it may be Methu&s;elah, or
Metrodorus, or Metellus, or Mathu|rinus,
or Malthinnus, or Matamoros,
or&mdash;&endq; &startq;No, (cried my uncle
laughing) it is neither of tho&s;e, captain:
&mdash;my name is Matthew Bramble, at
your &s;ervice.&mdash;The truth is, I have a
fooli&s;h pique at the name of Matthew,
becau&s;e it $avours of tho&s;e canting hypo|crites,
who, in Cromwell's time, chri&s;t|ened
all their children by names taken
from the &s;cripture.&endq;&mdash;&startq;A fooli&s;h
pique indeed, (cried Mrs. Tabby) and
even &s;inful, to fall out with your name
becau&s;e it is taken from holy writ.&mdash;
I would have you to know, you was
called after great-uncle Matthew ap
Madoc ap Meredith, e&s;quire, of Llan|wy&s;thin,
in Montgomery&s;hire, ju&s;tice
of the <HI>quorum,</HI> and <HI>cru&s;ty ruttleorum,</HI> a
gentleman of great worth and property,
de&s;cended in a &s;trait line, by the fe|male
&s;ide, from Llewellyn, prince of
Wales.&endq;</P>
<P>This genealogical anecdote &s;eemed to
make &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion upon the North-Briton,
who bowed very low to the de|&s;cendants
of Llewellyn, and ob&s;erved that
he him&s;elf had the honour of a &s;criptural
nomination. The lady expre&s;&s;ing a de|&s;ire
<PB N="165" REF="167">
of knowing his addre&s;s, he &s;aid, he
de&s;igned him&s;elf Lieutenant Obadiah
Li&s;mahago; and, in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t her
memory, he pre&s;ented her with a &s;lip of
paper in&s;cribed with the&s;e three words,
which &s;he repeated with great empha&s;is,
declaring, it was one of the mo&s;t noble
and &s;onorous names &s;he had ever heard.
He ob&s;erved, that Obadiah was an adven|titious
appellation, derived from his
great-grandfather, who had been one of
the original covenanters; but Li&s;mahago
was the family &s;urname, taken from a
place in Scotland &s;o called. He likewi&s;e
dropped &s;ome hints about the antiquity
of his pedigree, adding, with a &s;mile of
&s;elf-denial, <HI>Sed genus et proav$s, et quae
non fecimus ip&s;i, vix ea no&s;tra v$co,</HI> which
quotation he explained in deference to the
ladies; and Mrs. Tabitha did not fail to
compliment him on his mode&s;ty in wav|ing
the merit of his ance&s;try, adding,
that it was the le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to him, as he
had &s;uch a con&s;iderable fund of his own.
She now began to glew her&s;elf to his fa|vour
with the gro&s;&s;e&s;t adulation.&mdash;She
expatiated upon the antiquity and virtues
of the Scotti&s;h nation, upon their valour,
probity, learning, and politene&s;s.&mdash;She
even de&s;cended to encomiums on his own
<PB N="166" REF="168">
per&s;onal addre&s;s, his gallantry, good &s;en&s;e,
and erudition.&mdash;She appealed to her bro|ther,
whether the captain was not the
very image of our cou&s;in governor Grif|fith.&mdash;
She di&s;covered a &s;urpri&s;ing eager|ne&s;s
to know the particulars of his life,
and a&s;ked a thou&s;and que&s;tions concern|ing
his atchievements in war; all which
Mr. Li&s;mahago an&s;wered with a &s;ort of
je&s;uitical re&s;erve, affecting a reluctance to
&s;atisfy her curio&s;ity on a &s;ubject that con|cerned
his own exploits.</P>
<P>By dint of her interrogations, however,
we learned, that he and en&s;ign Murphy
had made their e&s;cape from the French
ho&s;pital at Montreal, and taken to the
woods, in hope of reaching &s;ome Engli&s;h
&s;ettlement; but mi&s;taking their route,
they fell in with a party of Miamis, who
carried them away in captivity. The in|tention
of the&s;e Indians was to give one
of them as an adopted &s;on to a venerable
$achem, who had lo&s;t his own in the
cour&s;e of the war, and to &s;acrifice the
other according to the cu&s;tom of the
country. Murphy, as being the younger
and hand&s;omer of the two, was de&s;igned
to fill the place of the decea&s;ed, not only
as the &s;on of the &s;achem, but as the
&s;pou&s;e of a beautiful &s;quaw, to whom his
<PB N="167" REF="169">
predece&s;&s;or had been betrothed; but in
pa&s;&s;ing through the different whigwhams
or villages of the Miamis, poor Murphy
was &s;o mangled by the women and chil|dren,
who have the privilege of torturing
all pri&s;oners in their pa&s;&s;age, that, by the
time they arrived at the place of the &s;a|chem's
re&s;idence, he was rendered altoge|ther
unfit for the purpo&s;es of marriage:
it was determined therefore, in the a&s;&s;em|bly
of the warriors, that en&s;ign Murphy
&s;hould be brought to the &s;take, and that
the lady &s;hould be given to lieutenant
Li&s;mahago, who had likewi&s;e received
his &s;hare of torments, though they had
not produced ema&s;culation.&mdash;A joint of
one finger had been cut, or rather &s;awed
off with a ru&s;ty knife; one of his great
toes was cru&s;hed into a ma&s;h betwixt two
&s;tones; &s;ome of his teeth were drawn,
or dug out with a crooked nail; &s;plinter|ed
reeds had been thru&s;t up his no&s;trils
and other tender parts; and the calves of
his legs had been blown up with mines
of gunpowder dug in the fle&s;h with the
&s;harp point of the tomahawk.</P>
<P>The Indians them&s;elves allowed that
Murphy died with great heroi&s;m, &s;inging,
as his death &s;ong, the <HI>Drimmendoo,</HI> in
concert with Mr. Li&s;mahago, who was
<PB N="168" REF="170">
pre&s;ent at the &s;olemnity. After the war|riors
and the matrons had made a hearty
meal upon the mu&s;cular fle&s;h which they
pared from the victim, and had applied a
great variety of tortures, which he bore
without flinching, an old lady, with a
&s;harp knife, &s;cooped out one of his eyes,
and put a burning coal in the &s;ocket.
The pain of this operation was &s;o exqui|&s;ite
that he could not help bellowing,
upon which the audience rai&s;ed a &s;hout of
exultation, and one of the warriors &s;teal|ing
behind him, gave him the <HI>coup de
grace</HI> with a hatchet.</P>
<P>Li&s;mahago's bride, the &s;quaw Squin|kina
$oo&s;ta, di&s;tingui&s;hed her&s;elf on this
occa&s;ion.&mdash;She &s;hewed a great &s;upe|riority
of genius in the tortures which
&s;he contrived and executed with her own
hands.&mdash;She vied with the &s;toute&s;t war|rior
in eating the fle&s;h of the &s;acrifice;
and after all the other females were fud|dled
with dram-drinking, &s;he was not &s;o
intoxicated but that &s;he was able to play
the game of the platter with the conjur|ing
&s;achem, and afterwards go through
the ceremony of her own wedding, which
was con&s;ummated that &s;ame evening.
The captain had lived very happily
with this accompli&s;hed &s;quaw for two
<PB N="169" REF="171">
years, during which &s;he bore him a &s;on,
who is now the repre&s;entative of his mo|ther's
tribe; but, at length, to his un|&s;peakable
grief, &s;he had died of a fever,
occa&s;ioned by eating too much raw bear,
which they had killed in a hunting ex|cur&s;ion.</P>
<P>By this time, Mr. Li&s;mahago was
elected &s;achem, acknowledged fir&s;t war|rior
of the Badger tribe, and dignified
with the name or epithet of Occacana&s;tao|garora,
which &s;ignifies <HI>nimble as a wea|&s;el;</HI>
but all the&s;e advantages and honours
he was obliged to re&s;ign, in con&s;equence
of being exchanged for the orator of the
community, who had been taken pri&s;oner
by the Indians that were in alliance with
the Engli&s;h. At the peace, he had &s;old
out upon half-pay, and was returned to
Britain, with a view to pa&s;s the re&s;t of
his life in his own country, where he
hoped to find &s;ome retreat where his &s;len|der
finances would afford him a decent
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Such are the out-lines of
Mr. Li&s;mahago's hi&s;tory, to which. Ta|bitha
<HI>did &s;eriou&s;ly incline her ear;</HI>&mdash;indeed,
&s;he &s;eemed to be taken with the &s;ame
charms that captivated the heart of
De&s;demona, who loved the Moor <HI>for the
dangers he had pa&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="172">
The de&s;cription of poor Murphy's &s;uf|ferings,
which threw my &s;i&s;ter Liddy into
a &s;woon, extracted &s;ome &s;ighs from the
brea&s;t of Mrs. Tabby: when &s;he under|&s;tood
he had been rendered unfit for mar|riage,
&s;he began to &s;pit, and ejaculated,
&startq;Je&s;us, what cruel barbarians!&endq; and &s;he
made wry faces at the lady's nuptial re|pa&s;t;
but &s;he was eagerly curious to
know the particulars of her marriage|dre&s;s;
whether &s;he wore high-brea&s;t|ed
&s;tays or boddice, a robe of &s;ilk or
velvet, and laces of Mechlin or minio|nette&mdash;&s;he
&s;uppo&s;ed, as they were con|nected
with the French, &s;he u&s;ed <HI>rouge,</HI>
and had her hair dre&s;&s;ed in the Pari&s;ian
fa&s;hion. The captain would have de|clined
giving a categorical explanation of
all the&s;e particulars, ob&s;erving, in gene|ral,
that the Indians were too tenacious
of their own cu&s;toms to adopt the modes
of any nation what&s;oever: he &s;aid,
moreover, that neither the &s;implicity of
their manners, nor the commerce of their
country, would admit of tho&s;e articles of
luxury which are deemed magnificence in
Europe; and that they were too virtuous
and &s;en&s;ible to encourage the introduction
of any fa&s;hion which might help to render
them corrupt and effeminate.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="173">
The&s;e ob&s;ervations &s;erved only to in|flame
her de&s;ire of knowing the particu|lars
about which &s;he had enquired; and,
with all his eva&s;ion, he could not help
di&s;covering the following circum&s;tances&mdash;
that his prince&s;s had neither &s;hoes, &s;tock|ings,
&s;hift, nor any kind of linen&mdash;that
her bridal dre&s;s con&s;i&s;ted of a petticoat of
red bays, and a fringed blanket, fa&s;tened
about her &s;houlders with a copper &s;kewer;
but of ornaments &s;he had great plenty.&mdash;
Her hair was curiou&s;ly plaited, and inter|woven
with bobbins of human bone&mdash;one
eye-lid was painted green, and the other
yellow; the cheeks were blue, the lips
white, the teeth red, and there was a
black li&s;t drawn down the middle of the
forehead as far as the tip of the no&s;e&mdash;a
couple of gaudy parrot's feathers were
&s;tuck through the divi&s;ion of the no&s;trils
&mdash;there was a blue &s;tone &s;et in the chin&mdash;
her ear-rings con&s;i&s;ted of two pieces of
hickery, of the &s;ize and &s;hape of drum|&s;ticks&mdash;her
arms and legs were adorned
with bracelets of wampum&mdash;her brea&s;t glit|tered
with numerous &s;trings of gla&s;s beads
&mdash;&s;he wore a curious pouch, or pocket,
of woven gra&s;s, elegantly painted with
various colours&mdash;about her neck was
hung the fre&s;h &s;calp of a Mohawk war|rior,
<PB N="172" REF="174">
whom her decea&s;ed lover had lately
&s;lain in battle&mdash;and, finally, &s;he was
anointed from head to foot with bear's
grea&s;e, which &s;ent forth a mo&s;t agreeable
odour.</P>
<P>One would imagine that the&s;e para|phernalia
would not have been much ad|mired
by a modern fine lady; but Mrs.
Tabitha was re&s;olved to approve of all
the captain's connexions.&mdash;She wi&s;hed,
indeed, the &s;quaw had been better pro|vided
with linen; but &s;he owned there
was much ta&s;te and fancy in her orna|ments;
&s;he made no doubt, therefore,
that madam Squinkinacoo&s;ta was a young
lady of good &s;en&s;e and rare accompli&s;h|ments,
and a good chri&s;tian at bottom.
Then &s;he a&s;ked whether his con&s;ort had
been high-church or low-church, pre&s;by|terian
or anabapti&s;t, or had been favour|ed
with any glimmering of the new light
of the go&s;pel? When he confe&s;&s;ed that
&s;he and her whole nation were utter
&s;trangers to the chri&s;tian faith, &s;he gazed
at him with &s;igns of a&s;toni&s;hment, and
Humphry Clinker, who chanced to be in
the room, uttered a hollow groan.</P>
<P>After &s;ome pau&s;e, &startq;In the name of
God, captain Li&s;mahago, (cried &s;he)
what religion do they profe&s;s?&endq; &startq;As
<PB N="173" REF="175">
to religion, madam, (an&s;wered the
lieutenant) it is among tho&s;e Indians a
matter of great &s;implicity&mdash;they never
heard of any <HI>Alliance between Church and
State.</HI>&mdash;They, in general, wor&s;hip two
contending principles; one the Foun|tain
of all Good, the other the &s;ource
of evil.&mdash;The common people there,
as in other countries, run into the ab|&s;urdities
of &s;uper&s;tition; but &s;en&s;ible
men pay adoration to a Supreme Being,
who created and &s;u&s;tains the univer&s;e.&endq;
&startq;O! what pity, (exclaimed the pious
Tabby) that &s;ome holy man has not
been in&s;pired to go and convert the&s;e
poor heathens!&endq;</P>
<P>The lieutenant told her, that while he
re&s;ided among them, two French mi&s;&s;io|naries
arrived, in order to convert them
to the catholic religion; but when they
talked of my&s;teries and revelations, which
they could neither explain nor authenti|cate,
and called in the evidence of mira|cles
which they believed upon hear&s;ay;
when they taught, that the Supreme
Creator of Heaven and Earth had allow|ed
his only Son, his own equal in power
and glory, to enter the bowels of a wo|man,
to be born as a human creature,
to be in&s;ulted, flagellated, and even exe|cuted
<PB N="174" REF="176">
as a malefactor; when they pre|tended
to create God him&s;elf, to &s;wallow,
dige&s;t, revive, and multiply him <HI>ad infi|nitum,</HI>
by the help of a little flour and
water, the Indians were &s;hocked at the im|piety
of their pre&s;umption.&mdash;They were
examined by the a&s;&s;embly of the &s;achems,
who de&s;ired them to prove the divinity
of their mi&s;&s;ion by &s;ome miracle.&mdash;They
an&s;wered, that it was not in their power.
&mdash;&startq;If you were really &s;ent by Heaven
for our conver&s;ion, (&s;aid one of the
&s;achems) you would certainly have
&s;ome &s;upernatural endowments, at lea&s;t
you would have the gift of tongues, in
order to explain your doctrine to the
different nations among which you are
employed; but you are &s;o ignorant of
our language, that you cannot expre&s;s
your&s;elves even on the mo&s;t trifling
&s;ubjects.&endq;</P>
<P>In a word, the a&s;&s;embly were convinced
of their being cheats, and even &s;u&s;pected
them of being &s;pies:&mdash;they ordered them
a bag of Indian corn a piece, and ap|pointed
a guide to conduct them to the
frontiers; but the mi&s;&s;ionaries having
more zeal than di&s;cretion, refu&s;ed to quit
the vineyard.&mdash;They per&s;i&s;ted in &s;aying
ma&s;s, in preaching, baptizing, and &s;quab|bling
<PB N="175" REF="177">
with the conjurers, or prie&s;ts of the
country, till they had thrown the whole
community into confu&s;ion.&mdash;Then the
a&s;&s;embly proceeded to try them as im|pious
impo&s;tors, who repre&s;ented the Al|mighty
as a trifling, weak, capricious be|ing,
and pretended to make, unmake,
and reproduce him at plea&s;ure: they
were, therefore, convicted of bla&s;phemy
and &s;edition, and condemned to the &s;take,
where they died &s;inging <HI>Salve regina,</HI> in a
rapture of joy, for the crown of martyr|dom
which they had thus obtained.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of this conver&s;ation, lieu|tenant
Li&s;mahago dropt &s;ome hints by
which it appeared he him&s;elf was a free|thinker.
Our aunt &s;eemed to be &s;tartled
at certain &s;arca&s;ms he threw out again&s;t
the creed of &s;aint Athana&s;ius.&mdash;He dwelt
much upon the words, <HI>rea&s;on, philo&s;ophy,</HI>
and <HI>contradiction in terms</HI>&mdash;he bid defiance
to the eternity of hell-fire; and even
threw &s;uch &s;quibs at the immortality of
the &s;oul, as &s;inged a little the whi&s;kers of
Mrs. Tabitha's faith; for, by this time,
&s;he began to look upon Li&s;mahago as a
prodigy of learning and &s;agacity.&mdash;In
&s;hort, he could be no longer in&s;en&s;ible to
the advances &s;he made towards his affec|tion;
and although there was &s;omething
<PB N="176" REF="178">
repul&s;ive in his nature, he overcame it &s;o
far as to make &s;ome return to her civilities.
&mdash;Perhaps, he thought it would be no bad
&s;cheme, in a &s;uperannuated lieutenant
on half-pay, to effect a conjunction with
an old maid, who, in all probability, had
fortune enough to keep him ea&s;y and
comfortable in the fag-end of his days.&mdash;
An ogling corre&s;pondence forthwith com|menced
between this amiable pair of ori|ginals.&mdash;
He began to &s;weeten the natural
acidity of his di&s;cour&s;e with the treacle of
compliment and commendation.&mdash;He
from time to time offered her &s;nuff, of
which he him&s;elf took great quantities,
and even made her a pre&s;ent of a pur&s;e of
&s;ilk gra&s;s, woven by the hands of the
amiable Squinkinacoo&s;ta, who had u&s;ed
it as a &s;hot-pouch in her hunting-expedi|tions.</P>
<P>From Donca&s;ter northwards, all the
windows of all the inns are &s;crawled with
doggrel rhimes, in abu&s;e of the Scotch
nation; and what &s;urpri&s;ed me very
much, I did not perceive one line written
in the way of recrimination&mdash;Curious to
hear what Li&s;mahago would &s;ay on this
&s;ubject, I pointed out to him a very &s;cur|rilous
epigram again&s;t his countrymen,
which was engraved on one of the win|dows
<PB N="177" REF="179">
of the parlour where we &s;at.&mdash;He
read it with the mo&s;t &s;tarched compo&s;ure;
and when I a&s;ked his opinion of the poe|try,
&startq;It is vara ter&s;e and vara poignant;
(&s;aid he) but with the help of a wat
di&s;h-clout, it might be rendered more
clear and par&s;picous.&mdash;I marvel much
that &s;ome modern wit has not publi&s;h|ed
a collection of the&s;e e&s;&s;ays under
the title of the <HI>Glazier's Triumph over
Sawney the Scot</HI>&mdash;I'm per&s;uaded it
would be a vara agreable offering to
the patriots of London and We&s;tmin|&s;ter.&endq;
When I expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;ur|prize
that the natives of Scotland, who
travel this way, had not broke all the
windows upon the road, &startq;With &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion,
(replied the lieutenant) that were
but &s;hallow policy&mdash;it would only &s;erve
to make the &s;atire more cutting and
&s;evere; and, I think, it is much better
to let it &s;tand in the window, than
have it pre&s;ented in the reckoning.&endq;</P>
<P>My uncle's jaws began to quiver with
indignation.&mdash;He &s;aid, the &s;cribblers
of &s;uch infamous &s;tuff de&s;erved to be
&s;courged at the cart's tail for di&s;gracing
their country with &s;uch monuments of
malice and &s;tupidity.&mdash;&startq;The&s;e vermin
(&s;aid he) do not con&s;ider, that they are
<PB N="178" REF="180">
affording their fellow-&s;ubjects, whom
they abu&s;e, continual matter of &s;elf-gratulation,
as well as the means of ex|ecuting
the mo&s;t manly vengeance that
can be taken for &s;uch low, illiberal at|tacks.
For my part, I admire the
philo&s;ophic forbearance of the Scots,
as much as I de&s;pi&s;e the in&s;olence of
tho&s;e wretched libellers, which is akin
to the arrogance of the village cock,
who never crows but upon his own
dunghill.&endq; The captain, with an af|fectation
of candour, ob&s;erved, that men
of illiberal minds were produced in every
&s;oil; that in &s;uppo&s;ing tho&s;e were the
&s;entiments of the Engli&s;h in general, he
&s;hould pay too great a compliment to his
own country, which was not of con&s;e|quence
enough to attract the envy of &s;uch
a flouri&s;hing and powerful people.</P>
<P>Mrs. Tabby broke forth again in prai&s;e
of his moderation, and declared that
Scotland was the &s;oil which produced eve|ry
virtue under heaven.&mdash;When Li&s;ma|hago
took his leave for the night, &s;he a&s;k|ed
her brother if the captain was not the
prettie&s;t gentleman he had ever &s;een; and
whether there was not &s;omething wonder|fully
engaging in his a&s;pect?&mdash;Mr. Bram|ble
having eyed her &s;ome time in &s;ilence,
<PB N="179" REF="181">
&startq;Si&s;ter, (&s;aid he) the lieutenant is, for
aught I know, an hone&s;t man, and a
good officer&mdash;he has a con&s;iderable
&s;hare of under&s;tanding, and a title to
more encouragement than he &s;eems to
have met with in life; but I cannot,
with a &s;afe con&s;cience, affirm, that he
is the prettie&s;t gentleman I ever &s;aw; nei|ther
can I di&s;cern any engaging charm
in his countenance, which, I vow to
Gad, is, on the contrary, very hard-favoured
and forbidding.&endq;</P>
<P>I have endeavoured to ingratiate my|&s;elf
with this North-Briton, who is really
a curio&s;ity; but he has been very &s;hy of
my conver&s;ation ever &s;ince I laughed at
his a&s;&s;erting that the Engli&s;h tongue was
&s;poke with more propriety at Edinburgh
than at London. Looking at me with a
double &s;queeze of &s;ouring in his a&s;pect,
&startq;If the old definition be true, (&s;aid he)
that ri&s;ibility is the di&s;tingui&s;hing cha|racteri&s;tic
of a rational creature, the
Engli&s;h are the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed for
rationality of any people I ever knew&endq;
I owned, that the Engli&s;h were ea&s;ily
&s;truck with any thing that appeared ludi|crous,
and apt to laugh accordingly; but
it did not follow, that, becau&s;e they were
more given to laughter, they had more
<PB N="180" REF="182">
rationality than their neighbours: I &s;aid,
&s;uch an inference would be an injury to
the Scots, who were by no means defec|tive
in rationality, though generally &s;up|po&s;ed
little &s;ubject to the impre&s;&s;ions of
humour.</P>
<P>The captain an&s;wered, that this &s;uppo|&s;ition
mu&s;t have been deduced either from
their conver&s;ation or their compo&s;itions,
of which the Engli&s;h could not po&s;&s;ibly
judge with preci&s;ion, as they did not un|der&s;tand
the dialect u&s;ed by the Scots in
common di&s;cour&s;e, as well as in their
works of humour. When I de&s;ired to
know what tho&s;e works of humour were,
he mentioned a con&s;iderable number of
pieces, which he in&s;i&s;ted were equal in
point of humour to any thing extant in
any language dead or living.&mdash;He, in
particular, recommended a collection of
detached poems, in two &s;mall volumes,
intituled, <HI>The Ever-green,</HI> and the works
of Allan Ram&s;ay, which I intend to pro|vide
my&s;elf with at Edinburgh.&mdash;He ob|&s;erved,
that a North-Briton is &s;een to a di&s;|advantage
in an Engli&s;h company, becau&s;e
he &s;peaks in a dialect that they can't reli&s;h,
and in a phra&s;eology which they don't un|der&s;tand.&mdash;
He therefore finds him&s;elf un|der
a re&s;traint, which is a great enemy to
<PB N="181" REF="183">
wit and humour.&mdash;The&s;e are faculties
which never appear in full lu&s;tre, but
when the mind is perfectly at ea&s;e, and,
as an excellent writer &s;ays, enjoys <HI>her
elbow-room.</HI></P>
<P>He proceeded to explain his a&s;&s;ertion
that the Engli&s;h language was &s;poken with
greater propriety at Edinburgh than in
London.&mdash;He &s;aid, what we generally
called the Scotti&s;h dialect was, in fact,
true, genuine old Engli&s;h, with a mixture
of &s;ome French terms and idioms, adopt|ed
in a long intercour&s;e betwixt the
French and Scotch nations; that the mo|dern
Engli&s;h, from affectation and fal&s;e
refinement, had weakened, and even cor|rupted
their language, by throwing out
the guttural &s;ounds, altering the pronun|ciation
and the quantity, and di&s;u&s;ing
many words and terms of great &s;ignifi|cance.
In con&s;equence of the&s;e innova|tions,
the works of our be&s;t poets, &s;uch as
Chaucer, Spen&s;er, and even Shake&s;peare,
were become, in many parts, unintelligi|ble
to the natives of South-Britain, where|as
the Scots, who retain the antient lan|guage,
under&s;tand them without the help
of a glo&s;&s;ary. &startq;For in&s;tance, (&s;aid he)
how have your commentators been
puzzled by the following expre&s;&s;ion in
<PB N="182" REF="184">
the <HI>Tempe&s;t&mdash;He's gentle, and not fearful;</HI>
as if it was a paralogi&s;m to &s;ay, that
being <HI>gentle,</HI> he mu&s;t of cour&s;e be <HI>cou|rageous:</HI>
but the truth is, one of the
original meanings, if not the &s;ole mean|ing,
of that word was, <HI>noble, high-minded;</HI>
and to this day, a Scotch wo|man,
in the &s;ituation of the young lady
in the <HI>Tempe&s;t,</HI> would expre&s;s her&s;elf
nearly in the &s;ame terms&mdash;Don't pro|voke
him; for being gentle, that is,
<HI>high &s;pirited,</HI> he won't tamely bear an
in&s;ult. Spen&s;er, in the very fir&s;t &s;tanza
of his <HI>Fairy Queen,</HI> &s;ays,&endq;</P>
<P>A <HI>gentle</HI> knight was pricking on the plain;&endq;
&startq;which knight, far from being <HI>tame</HI> and
fearful, was &s;o &s;tout that&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Nothing did he dread, but ever was ydr$d.&endq;</P>
<P>To prove that we had impaired the
energy of our language by fal&s;e refine|ment,
he mentioned the following words,
which, though widely different in &s;ignifi|cation,
are pronounced exactly in the
&s;ame manner&mdash;<HI>wright, write, right, rite;</HI>
but among the Scots, the&s;e words are as
different in pronunciation, as they are in
meaning and orthography; and this is the
ca&s;e with many others which he mention|ed
<PB N="183" REF="185">
by way of illu&s;tration.&mdash;He, more|over,
took notice, that we had (for what
rea&s;on he could never learn) altered the
&s;ound of our vowels from that which is
retained by all the nations in Europe; an
alteration which rendered the language
extremely difficult to foreigners, and
made it almo&s;t impracticable to lay
down general rules for orthography and
pronunciation. Be&s;ides, the vowels were
no longer &s;imple &s;ounds in the mouth of
an Engli&s;hman, who pronounced both <HI>i</HI>
and <HI>u</HI> as diphthongs. Finally, he affirmed,
that we mumbled our &s;peech with our
lips and teeth, and ran the words toge|ther
without pau&s;e or di&s;tinction, in &s;uch
a manner, that a foreigner, though he un|der&s;tood
Engli&s;h tolerably well, was often
obliged to have recour&s;e to a Scotchman
to explain what a native of England had
&s;aid in his own language.</P>
<P>The truth of this remark was confirmed
by Mr. Bramble from his own expe|rience;
but he accounted for it on another
principle.&mdash;He &s;aid, the &s;ame ob&s;erva|tion
would hold in all languages; that a
Swi&s;s talking French was more ea&s;ily un|der&s;tood
than a Pari&s;ian, by a foreigner
who had not made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the
language; becau&s;e every language had
<PB N="184" REF="186">
its peculiar recitative, and it would always
require more pains, attention, and practice,
to acquire both the words and the mu&s;ic,
than to learn the words only; and yet no
body would deny, that the one was im|perfect
without the other: he therefore
apprehended, that the Scotchman and the
Swi&s;s were better under&s;tood by learners,
becau&s;e they &s;poke the words only, with|out
the mu&s;ic, which they could not re|hear&s;e.
One would imagine this check
might have damped the North-Briton;
but it &s;erved only to agitate his humour
for di&s;putation.&mdash;He &s;aid, if every
nation had its own recitative or mu&s;ic,
the Scots had theirs, and the Scotchman
who had not yet acquired the cadence of
the Engli&s;h, would naturally u&s;e his own
in &s;peaking their language; therefore, if
he was better under&s;tood than the native,
his recitative mu&s;t be more intelligible
than that of the Engli&s;h; of con&s;equence,
the dialect of the Scots had an advantage
over that of their fellow-&s;ubjects, and
this was another &s;trong pre&s;umption that
the modern Engli&s;h had corrupted their
language in the article of pronunciation.</P>
<P>The lieutenant was, by this time, be|come
&s;o polemical, that every time he
opened his mouth out flew a paradox,
<PB N="185" REF="187">
which he maintained with all the enthu|&s;ia&s;m
of altercation; but all his paradoxes
&s;avoured &s;trong of a partiality for his own
country. He undertook to prove that
poverty was a ble&s;&s;ing to a nation; that
<HI>oatmeal</HI> was preferable to <HI>wheat-flour;</HI> and
that the wor&s;hip of Cloacina, in temples
which admitted both &s;exes, and every
rank of votaries promi&s;cuou&s;ly, was a fil|thy
&s;pecies of idolatry that outraged
every idea of delicacy and decorum. I
did not &s;o much wonder at his broaching
the&s;e doctrines, as at the arguments,
equally whim&s;ical and ingenious, which
he adduced in &s;upport of them.</P>
<P>In fine, lieutenant Li&s;mahago is a cu|rio&s;ity
which I have not yet &s;ufficiently
peru&s;ed; and therefore I &s;hall be &s;orry
when we lo&s;e his company, though, God
knows, there is nothing very amiable in
his manner or di&s;po&s;ition.&mdash;As he goes
directly to the &s;outh-we&s;t divi&s;ion of
Scotland, and we proceed in the road to
Berwick, we &s;hall part to-morrow at a
place called Felton-bridge; and, I dare
&s;ay, this &s;eparation will be very grievous
to our aunt Mrs. Tabitha, unle&s;s &s;he has

<LETTER>
<OPENER>To DR. LEWIS.
DEAR DOCTOR,</OPENER>
<P>I HAVE now reached the northern
extremity of England, and &s;ee, clo&s;e to
my chamber-window, the Tweed gliding
through the arches of that bridge which
connects this &s;uburb to the town of Ber|wick.&mdash;
York&s;hire you have &s;een, and
therefore I &s;hall &s;ay nothing of that opu|lent
province. The city of Durham ap|pears
like a confu&s;ed heap of &s;tones and
brick, accumulated &s;o as to cover a
mountain, round which a river winds its
brawling cour&s;e. The &s;treets are gene|rally
narrow, dark, and unplea&s;ant, and
<PB N="187" REF="189">
many of them almo&s;t impa&s;&s;ible in con&s;e|quence
of their declivity. The cathedral
is a huge gloomy pile; but the clergy are
well lodged.&mdash;The bi&s;hop lives in a
princely manner&mdash;the golden prebends
keep plentiful tables&mdash;and, I am told,
there is &s;ome good &s;ociable company in
the place; but the country, when viewed
from the top of Gate&s;head Fell, which ex|tends
to Newca&s;tle, exhibits the highe&s;t
&s;cene of cultivation that ever I beheld.
As for Newca&s;tle, it lies mo&s;tly in a bot|tom,
on the banks of the Tyne, and
makes an appearance &s;till more di&s;agree|able
than that of Durham; but it is ren|dered
populous and rich by indu&s;try and
commerce; and the country lying on both
&s;ides the river, above the town, yields a
delightful pro&s;pect of agriculture and
plantation. Morpeth and Alnwick are
neat, pretty towns, and this la&s;t is fa|mous
for the ca&s;tle which has belonged &s;o
many ages to the noble hou&s;e of Piercy,
earls of Northumberland.&mdash;It is, doubt|le&s;s,
a large edifice, containing a great
number of apartments, and &s;tands in a
commanding &s;ituation; but the &s;trength
of it &s;eems to have con&s;i&s;ted not &s;o much
in its &s;ite, or the manner in which it is for|tified,
as in the valour of its defendants.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="190">
Our adventures &s;ince we left Scarbo|rough,
are &s;carce worth reciting; and yet
I mu&s;t make you acquainted with my
&s;i&s;ter Tabby's progre&s;s in hu&s;band-hunt|ing,
after her di&s;appointments at Bath and
London. She had actually begun to
practi&s;e upon a certain adventurer, who
was in fact a highwayman by profe&s;&s;ion;
but he had been u&s;ed to &s;nares much more
dangerous than any &s;he could lay, and
e&s;caped accordingly.&mdash;Then &s;he opened
her batteries upon an old weather-beaten
Scotch lieutenant, called Li&s;mahago, who
joined us at Durham, and is, I think,
one of the mo&s;t &s;ingular per&s;onages I ever
encountered.&mdash;His manner is as har&s;h as
his countenance; but his peculiar turn of
thinking, and his pack of knowledge
made up of the remnants of rarities, ren|dered
his conver&s;ation de&s;irable, in &s;pite
of his pedantry and ungracious addre&s;s.
&mdash;I have often met with a crab-apple in a
hedge, which I have been tempted to eat
for its flavour, even while I was di&s;gu&s;t|ed
by its au&s;terity. The &s;pirit of con|tradiction
is naturally &s;o &s;trong in Li&s;ma|hago,
that I believe in my con&s;cience he
has rummaged, and read, and &s;tudied
with indefatigable attention, in order to
qualify him&s;elf to refute e&s;tabli&s;hed max|ims,
<PB N="189" REF="191">
and thus rai&s;e trophies for the grati|fication
of polemical pride.&mdash;Such is the
a&s;perity of his &s;elf-conceit, that he will
not even acquie&s;ce in a tran&s;ient compli|ment
made to his own individual in parti|cular,
or to his country in general.</P>
<P>When I ob&s;erved, that he mu&s;t have
read a va&s;t number of books to be able to
di&s;cour&s;e on &s;uch a variety of &s;ubjects,
he declared he had read little or nothing,
and a&s;ked how he &s;hould find books
among the woods of America, where he
had &s;pent the greate&s;t part of his life. My
nephew remarking that the Scots in ge|neral
were famous for their learning, he
denied the imputation, and defied him to
prove it from their works.&mdash;&startq;The Scots
(&s;aid he) have a &s;light tincture of let|ters,
with which they make a parade
among people who are more illiterate
than them&s;elves; but they may be &s;aid
to float on the &s;urface of &s;cience, and
they have made very &s;mall advances
in the u&s;eful arts.&endq; &startq;At lea&s;t, (cried
Tabby) all the world allows that the
Scots behaved gloriou&s;ly in fighting
and conquering the &s;avages of Ameri|ca.&endq;
&startq;I can a&s;&s;ure you, madam, you
have been mi&s;informed; (replied the
lieutenant) in that continent the Scots
<PB N="190" REF="192">
did nothing more than their duty, nor
was there one corps in his maje&s;ty's &s;er|vice
that di&s;tingui&s;hed it&s;elf more than
another.&mdash;Tho&s;e who affected to extol
the Scots for &s;uperior merit, were no
friends to that nation.&endq;</P>
<P>Though he him&s;elf made free with his
countrymen, he would not &s;uffer any
other per&s;on to glance a &s;arca&s;m at them
with impunity. One of the company
chancing to mention lord B&mdash;'s inglo|rious
peace, the lieutenant immediately
took up the cudgels in his lord&s;hip's fa|vour,
and argued very &s;trenuou&s;ly to
prove that it was the mo&s;t honourable
and advantageous peace that England
had ever made &s;ince the foundation of the
monarchy.&mdash;Nay, between friends, he of|fered
&s;uch rea&s;ons on this &s;ubject, that I
was really confounded, if not convinced.
&mdash;He would not allow that the Scots
abounded above their proportion in the
army and navy of Great-Britain, or that
the Engli&s;h had any rea&s;on to &s;ay his
countrymen had met with extraordinary
encouragement in the &s;ervice.&mdash;&startq;When
a South and North-Briton (&s;aid he) are
competitors for a place or commi&s;&s;ion,
which is in the di&s;po&s;al of an Engli&s;h
mini&s;ter or an Engli&s;h general, it would
<PB N="191" REF="193">
be ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e that the prefe|rence
will not be given to the native
of England, who has &s;o many advan|tages
over his rival.&mdash;Fir&s;t and fore|mo&s;t,
he has in his favour that laudable
partiality, which, Mr. Addi&s;on &s;ays,
never fails to cleave to the heart of an
Engli&s;hman; &s;econdly, he has more
powerful connexions, and a greater
&s;hare of parliamentary intere&s;t, by
which tho&s;e conte&s;ts are generally de|cided;
and la&s;tly, he has a greater
command of money to &s;mooth the way
to his &s;ucce&s;s. For my own part, (&s;aid
he) I know no Scotch officer, who has
ri&s;en in the army above the rank of a
&s;ubaltern, without purcha&s;ing every de|gree
of preferment either with money
or recruits; but I know many gentle|men
of that country, who, for want of
money and intere&s;t, have grown grey
in the rank of lieutenants; whereas
very few in&s;tances of this ill-fortune
are to be found among the natives of
South-Britain.&mdash;Not that I would in|&s;inuate
that my countrymen have the
lea&s;t rea&s;on to complain.&mdash;Preferment
in the &s;ervice, like &s;ucce&s;s in any other
branch of traffic, will naturally favour
tho&s;e who have the greate&s;t &s;tock of
<PB N="192" REF="194">
ca&s;h and credit, merit and capacity be|ing
&s;uppo&s;ed equal on all &s;ides.&endq;</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t hardy of all this original's
po&s;itions were the&s;e:&mdash;That commerce
would, &s;ooner or later, prove the ruin of
every nation, where it flouri&s;hes to any ex|tent&mdash;
that the parliament was the rotten
part of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution&mdash;that the
liberty of the pre&s;s was a national evil&mdash;
and that the boa&s;ted in&s;titution of juries,
as managed in England, was productive
of &s;hameful perjury and flagrant inju&s;tice.
He ob&s;erved, that traffick was an enemy
to all the liberal pa&s;&s;ions of the &s;oul,
founded on the thir&s;t of lucre, a &s;ordid
di&s;po&s;ition to take advantage of the ne|ce&s;&s;ities
of our fellow-creatures.&mdash;He
affirmed, the nature of commerce was &s;uch,
that it could not be fixed or perpetuated,
but, having flowed to a certain height,
would immediately begin to ebb, and &s;o
continue till the channels &s;hould be left
almo&s;t dry; but there was no in&s;tance of
the tide's ri&s;ing a &s;econd time to any con|&s;iderable
influx in the &s;ame nation. Mean
while the &s;udden affluence occa&s;ioned by
trade, forced open all the &s;luices of luxury
and overflowed the land with every &s;pe|cies
of profligacy and corruption; a total
pravity of manners would en&s;ue, and this
<PB N="193" REF="195">
mu&s;t be attended with bankruptcy and
ruin. He ob&s;erved of the parliament,
that the practice of buying boroughs, and
canva&s;&s;ing for votes, was an avowed
&s;y&s;tem of venality, already e&s;tabli&s;hed on
the ruins of principle, integrity, faith,
and good order, in con&s;equence of which
the elected and the elector, and, in &s;hort,
the whole body of the people, were
equally and univer&s;ally contaminated and
corrupted. He affirmed, that of a par|liament
thus con&s;tituted, the crown
would always have influence enough to
&s;ecure a great majority in its dependence,
from the great number of po&s;ts, places,
and pen&s;ions it had to be&s;tow; that &s;uch
a parliament would (as it had already
done) lengthen the term of its &s;itting and
authority, whenever the prince &s;hould
think it for his intere&s;t to continue the
repre&s;entatives; for, without doubt, they
had the &s;ame right to protract their au|thority
<HI>ad infinitum,</HI> as they had to extend
it from three to &s;even years.&mdash;With a
parliament, therefore, dependent upon
the crown, devoted to the prince, and
&s;upported by a &s;tanding army, garbled
and modelled for the purpo&s;e, any king
of England may, and probably &s;ome am|bitious
&s;overeign will, totally overthrow
<PB N="194" REF="196">
all the bulwarks of the con&s;titution; for
it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that a prince of a
high &s;pirit will tamely &s;ubmit to be
thwarted in all his mea&s;ures, abu&s;ed and
in&s;ulted by a populace of unbridled fero|city,
when he has it in his power to cru&s;h
all oppo&s;ition under his feet with the con|currence
of the legi&s;lature. He &s;aid, he
&s;hould always con&s;ider the liberty of the
pre&s;s as a national evil, while it enabled
the vile&s;t reptile to &s;oil the lu&s;tre of the
mo&s;t &s;hining merit, and furni&s;hed the
mo&s;t infamous incendiary with the means
of di&s;turbing the peace and de&s;troying the
good order of the community. He own|ed,
however, that, under due re&s;trictions,
it would be a valuable privilege; but af|firmed,
that at pre&s;ent there was no law in
England &s;ufficient to re&s;train it within
proper bounds.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to juries, he expre&s;&s;ed
him&s;elf to this effect:&mdash;Juries are ge|nerally
compo&s;ed of illiterate plebeians,
apt to be mi&s;taken, ea&s;ily mi&s;led, and open
to &s;ini&s;ter influence; for if either of the
parties to be tried, can gain over one of
the twelve jurors, he has &s;ecured the ver|dict
in his favour; the juryman thus
brought over will, in de&s;pight of all evi|dence
and conviction, generally hold out
<PB N="195" REF="197">
till his fellows are fatigued, and harra&s;&s;ed,
and &s;tarved into concurrence; in which
ca&s;e the verdict is unju&s;t, and the jurors
are all perjured: but ca&s;es will often oc|cur,
when the jurors are really divided in
opinion, and each &s;ide is convinced in op|po&s;ition
to the other; but no verdict will
be received, unle&s;s they are unanimous,
and they are all bound, not only in con|&s;cience,
but by oath, to judge and declare
according to their conviction.&mdash;What
then will be the con&s;equence?&mdash;They
mu&s;t either &s;tarve in company, or one &s;ide
mu&s;t &s;acrifice their con&s;cience to their
convenience, and join in a verdict which
they believe to be fal&s;e, This ab&s;urdity
is avoided in Sweden, where a bare ma|jority
is &s;ufficient; and in Scotland, where
two thirds of the jury are required to
concur in the verdict.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t not imagine that all the&s;e
deductions were made on his part, with|out
contradiction on mine.&mdash;No&mdash;the truth
is, I found my&s;elf piqued in point of ho|nour,
at his pretending to be &s;o much
wi&s;er than his neighbours.&mdash;I que&s;tioned
all his a&s;&s;ertions, &s;tarted innumerable ob|jections,
argued and wrangled with un|common
per&s;everance, and grew very
warm, and even violent, in the debate.&mdash;
<PB N="196" REF="198">
Sometimes he was puzzled, and once or
twice, I think, fairly refuted; but from
tho&s;e falls he ro&s;e again, like Antaeus,
with redoubled vigour, til at length I was
tired, exhau&s;ted, and really did not know
how to proceed, when luckily he dropped
a hint, by which he di&s;covered he had
been bred to the law; a confe&s;&s;ion which
enabled me to retire from the di&s;pute
with a good grace, as it could not be
&s;uppo&s;ed that a man like me, who had
been bred to nothing, &s;hould be able to
cope with a veteran in his own profe&s;&s;ion.
I believe, however, that I &s;hall for &s;ome
time continue to chew the cud of reflec|tion
upon many ob&s;ervations which this
original di&s;charged.</P>
<P>Whether our &s;i&s;ter Tabby was really
&s;truck with his conver&s;ation, or is re&s;olved
to throw at every thing &s;he meets in the
&s;hape of a man, till &s;he can fa&s;ten the ma|trimonial
noo&s;e, certain it is, &s;he has
taken de&s;perate &s;trides towards the affec|tion

$span$ &s;hould be to have his company

<PB N="197" REF="199">
told us, that his road was totally different
from that which we intended to take;
that, for his part, his company would be
of very little &s;ervice to us in our progre&s;s,
as he was utterly unacquainted with the
country, which he had left in his early youth,
con&s;equently, he could neither direct us
in our inquiries, nor introduce us to any
family of di&s;tinction. He &s;aid, he was &s;ti|mulated
by an irre&s;i&s;tible impul&s;e to revi&s;it
the <HI>paternus la$,</HI> or <HI>patria domus,</HI> though he
expected little &s;atisfaction, ina&s;much as he
under&s;tood that his nephew, the pre&s;ent
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, was but ill qualified to &s;upport
the honour of the family.&mdash;He a&s;&s;ured us,
however, as we de&s;ign to return by the
we&s;t road, that he will watch our motions,
and endeavour to pay his re&s;pects to us at
Dumfries.&mdash;Accordingly he took his
leave of us at a place half way betwixt
Morpeth and Alnwick, and pranced away
in great &s;tate, mounted on a tall, meagre,
raw-boned, &s;hambling grey gelding, with|out
e'er a tooth in his head, the very
counter-part of the rider; and, indeed,

<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bar^t. at

DEAR WAT,</OPENER>
<P>IN my two la&s;t you had &s;o much of
Li&s;mahago, that I &s;uppo&s;e you are glad
he is gone off the &s;tage for the pre&s;ent.&mdash;
I mu&s;t now de&s;cend to dome&s;tic occur|rences.&mdash;Love,
it &s;eems, is re&s;olved to
a&s;&s;ert his dominion over all the females
of our family.&mdash;After having practi&s;ed
upon poor Liddy's heart, and played
&s;trange vagaries with our aunt Mrs. Ta|bitha,
he began to run riot in the affec|tions
<PB N="200" REF="202">
of her woman Mrs. Winifred Jen|kins,
whom I have had occa&s;ion to men|tion
more than once in the cour&s;e of our
memoirs. Nature intended Jenkins for
&s;omething very different from the charac|ter
of her mi&s;tre&s;s; yet cu&s;tom and habit
have effected a wonderful re&s;emblance
betwixt them in many particulars. Win,
to be &s;ure, is much younger and more
agreeable in her per&s;on; &s;he is likewi&s;e
tender-hearted and benevolent, qualities
for which her mi&s;tre&s;s is by no means re|markable,
no more than &s;he is for being
of a timorous di&s;po&s;ition, and much &s;ub|ject
to fits of the mother, which are the
infirmities of Win's con&s;titution: but
then &s;he &s;eems to have adopted Mrs. Tab|by's
manner with her ca&s;t cloaths.&mdash;She
dre&s;&s;es and endeavours to look like her
mi&s;tre&s;s, although her own looks are much
more engaging.&mdash;She enters into her
&s;cheme of oeconomy, learns her phra&s;es,
repeats her remarks, imitates her &s;tile in
&s;colding the inferior &s;ervants, and, finally,
&s;ub&s;cribes implicitly to her &s;y&s;tem of de|votion&mdash;This,
indeed, &s;he found the
more agreeable, as it was in a great mea|&s;ure
introduced and confirmed by the mi|ni&s;try
of Clinker, with who&s;e per&s;onal
<PB N="201" REF="203">
merit &s;he &s;eems to have been &s;truck ever
&s;ince he exhibited the pattern of his
naked &s;kin at Marlborough.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, though Humphry had
this double hank upon her inclinations,
and exerted all his power to maintain the
conque&s;t he had made, he found it im|po&s;&s;ible
to guard it on the &s;ide of vanity,
where poor Win was as frail as any fe|male
in the kingdom. In &s;hort, my ra&s;|cal
Dutton profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf her admirer,
and, by dint of his outlandi&s;h qualifica|tions,
threw his rival Clinker out of the
&s;addle of her heart. Humphry may be
compared to an Engli&s;h pudding, compo&s;|ed
of good whole&s;ome flour and &s;uet, and
Dutton to a &s;yllabub or iced froth, which,
though agreeable to the ta&s;te, has nothing
&s;olid or &s;ub&s;tantial. The traitor not only
dazzled her with his &s;econd-hand finery,
but he fawned, and flattered, and cringed
&mdash;he taught her to take rappee, and pre|&s;ented
her with a &s;nuff-box of <HI>papier ma|ch&eacute;</HI>&mdash;he
&s;upplied her with a powder for
her teeth&mdash;he mended her complexion,
and he dre&s;&s;ed her hair in the Paris fa&s;hion
&mdash;he undertook to be her French ma&s;ter
and her dancing-ma&s;ter, as well as fri&s;eur,
and thus imperceptibly wound him&s;elf
into her good graces. Clinker perceived

the progre&s;s he had made, and repined in
&s;ecret.&mdash;He attempted to open her eyes
in the way of exhortation, and finding it
produced no effect had recour&s;e to prayer.
At Newca&s;tle, while he attended Mrs.
Tabby to the methodi&s;t meeting, his rival
accompanied Mrs. Jenkins to the play.
He was dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;ilk coat, made at
Paris for his former ma&s;ter, with a tawdry
wai&s;tcoat of tarni&s;hed brocard; he wore
his hair in a great bag with a huge &s;oli|taire,
and a long &s;word dangled from his
thigh. The lady was all of a flutter with
faded lute&s;tring, wa&s;hed gauze, and rib|bons
three times refre&s;hed; but &s;he was
mo&s;t remarkable for the fri&s;ure of her
head, which ro&s;e, like a pyramid, &s;even
inches above the &s;calp, and her face was
primed and patched from the chin up to
the eyes; nay, the gallant him&s;elf had
&s;pared neither red nor white in improving
the nature of his own complexion. In
this attire, they walked together through
the high &s;treet to the theatre, and as they
pa&s;&s;ed for players ready dre&s;&s;ed for act|ing,
they reached it unmole&s;ted; but as
it was &s;till light when they returned, and
by that time the people had got informa|tion
of their real character and condition,
they hi&s;&s;ed and hooted all the way, and
<PB N="203" REF="205">
Mrs. Jenkins was all be&s;pattered with
dirt, as well as in&s;ulted with the oppro|brious
name of <HI>painted Jezabel,</HI> &s;o that her
fright and mortification threw her into an
hy&s;teric fit the moment &s;he came home.</P>
<P>Clinker was &s;o incen&s;ed at Dutton,
whom he con&s;idered as the cau&s;e of her
di&s;grace, that he upbraided him &s;everely
for having turned the poor young wo|man's
brain. The other affected to treat
him with contempt, and mi&s;taking his
forbearance for want of courage, threaten|ed
to hor&s;e-whip him into good manners.
Humphry then came to me, humbly beg|ing
I would give him leave to cha&s;ti&s;e
my &s;ervant for his in&s;olence&mdash;&startq;He has
challenged me to fight him at &s;word's
point; (&s;aid he) but I might as well
challenge him to make a hor&s;e-&s;hoe,
or a plough-iron; for I know no more
of the one than he does of the other.&mdash;
Be&s;ides, it doth not become &s;ervants to
u&s;e tho&s;e weapons, or to claim the pri|vilege
of gentlemen to kill one another
when they fall out; moreover, I would
not have his blood upon my con&s;cience
for ten thou&s;and times the profit or &s;a|tisfaction
I &s;hould get by his death;
but if your honour won't be angry,
I'll engage to gee en a good drubbing,
<PB N="204" REF="206">
that, may hap, will do 'en &s;ervice, and
I'll take care it &s;hall do 'en no harm.&endq;
I &s;aid, I had no objection to what he pro|po&s;ed,
provided he could manage matters
&s;o as not to be found the aggre&s;&s;or, in
ca&s;e Dutton &s;hould pro&s;ecute him for an
a&s;&s;ault and battery.</P>
<P>Thus licen&s;ed, he retired; and that
&s;ame evening ea&s;ily provoked his rival to
&s;trike the fir&s;t blow, which Clinker return|ed
with &s;uch intere&s;t that he was obliged
to call for quarter, declaring, at the &s;ame
time, that he would exact &s;evere and
bloody &s;atisfaction the moment we &s;hould
pa&s;s the border, when he could run him
through the body without fear of the
con&s;equence.&mdash;This &s;cene pa&s;&s;ed in
pre&s;ence of lieutenant Li&s;mahago, who
encouraged Clinker to hazard a thru&s;t of
cold iron with his antagoni&s;t. &startq;Cold
iron (cried Humphry) I &s;hall never u&s;e
again&s;t the life of any human creature;
but I am &s;o far from being afraid of
his cold iron, that I &s;hall u&s;e nothing
in my defence but a good cudgel, which
&s;hall always be at his &s;ervice.&endq; In the
mean time, the fair cau&s;e of this conte&s;t,
Mrs. Winifred Jenkins, &s;eemed over|whelmed
with affliction, and Mr. Clinker
acted much on the re&s;erve, though he
<PB N="205" REF="207">
did not pre&s;ume to find fault with her
conduct.</P>
<P>The di&s;pute between the two rivals
was &s;oon brought to a very unexpected
i&s;&s;ue. Among our fellow-lodgers at Ber|wick,
was a couple from London, bound
to Edinburgh, on the voyage of matri|mony.
The female was the daughter and
heire&s;s of a pawn-broker decea&s;ed, who
had given her guardians the &s;lip, and put
her&s;elf under the tuition of a tall Hiber|nian,
who had conducted her thus far in
que&s;t of a clergyman to unite them in
marriage, without the formalities requir|ed
by the law of England. I know not
how the lover had behaved on the road,
&s;o as to decline in the favour of his inna|morata;
but, in all probability, Dutton
perceived a coldne&s;s on her &s;ide, which
encouraged him to whi&s;per, it was a pity
&s;he &s;hould have ca&s;t her affections upon a
taylor, which he affirmed the Iri&s;hman to
be. This di&s;covery completed her di&s;|gu&s;t,
of which my man taking the advan|tage,
began to recommend him&s;elf to her
good graces, and the &s;mooth-tongued ra&s;|cal
found no difficulty to in&s;inuate him&s;elf
into the place of her heart, from which
the other had been di&s;carded&mdash;Their re|&s;olution
was immediately taken. In the
<PB N="206" REF="208">
morning, before day, while poor Teague
lay &s;noring a-bed, his indefatigable rival
ordered a po&s;t-chai&s;e, and &s;et out with the
lady for Cold&s;tream, a few miles up the
Tweed, where there was a par&s;on who
dealt in this branch of commerce, and
there they were noo&s;ed, before the Iri&s;h|man
ever dreamt of the matter. But
when he got up at &s;ix o'clock, and found
the bird was flown, he made &s;uch a noi&s;e
as alarmed the whole hou&s;e. One of the
fir&s;t per&s;ons he encountered, was the po&s;|tilion
returned from Cold&s;tream, where he
had been witne&s;s to the marriage, and
over and above an hand&s;ome gratuity, had
received a bride's favour, which he now
wore in his cap&mdash;When the for&s;aken lover
under&s;tood they were actually married,
and &s;et out for London; and that Dut|ton
had di&s;covered to the lady, that he
(the Hibernian) was a taylor, he had like
to have run di&s;tracted. He tore the rib|bon
from the fellow's cap, and beat it
about his ears. He &s;wore he would pur|&s;ue
him to the gates of hell, and ordered a
po&s;t-chai&s;e and four to be got ready as
&s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; but, recollecting that his
finances would not admit of this way of
travelling, he was obliged to countermand
this order.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="209">
For my part, I knew nothing at all of
what had happened, till the po&s;tilion
brought me the keys of my trunk and
portmanteau, which he had received
from Dutton, who &s;ent me his re&s;pects,
hoping I would excu&s;e him for his abrupt
departure, as it was a &s;tep upon which his
fortune depended&mdash;Before I had time to
make my uncle acquainted with this event,
the Iri&s;hman bur&s;t into my chamber,
without any introduction, exclaiming,&mdash;
&startq;By my &s;oul, your &s;arvant has robbed
me of five thou&s;and pounds, and I'll
have &s;atisfaction, if I &s;hould be
hanged to-morrow.&mdash;&endq; When I a&s;k|ed
him who he was, &startq;My name (&s;aid
he) is Ma&s;ter Macloughlin&mdash;but it
&s;hould be Leighlin Oneale, for I am
come from Ter-Owen the Great; and &s;o
I am as good a gentleman as any in
Ireland; and that rogue, your &s;arvant,
&s;aid I was a taylor, which was as big a
lie as if he had called me the pope&mdash;
I'm a man of fortune, and have &s;pent
all I had; and &s;o being in di&s;tre&s;s, Mr.
Co&s;hgrave, the fa&s;hioner in Shuffolk|&s;treet,
tuck me out, and made me his
own private &s;hecretary: by the &s;ame
token, I was the la&s;t he bailed; for his
friends obliged him to tie him&s;elf up,
<PB N="208" REF="210">
that he would bail no more above ten
pounds; for why, becaa&s;e as how, he
could not refu&s;e any body that a&s;ked,
and therefore in time would have rob|bed
him&s;elf of his whole fortune, and,
if he had lived long at that rate, mu&s;t
have died bankrupt very &s;oon&mdash;and &s;o
I made my addre&s;&s;es to Mi&s;s Skinner,
a young lady of five thou&s;and pounds
fortune, who agreed to take me for
better nor wor&s;e; and, to be &s;ure, this
day would have put me in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, if
it had not been for that rogue, your
&s;arvant, who came like a tief, and &s;tole
away my property, and made her be|lieve
I was a taylor; and that &s;he was
going to marry the ninth part of a man:
but the devil burn my &s;oul, if ever I
catch him on the mountains of Tullo|ghobegly,
if I don't &s;hew him that I'm
nine times as good a man as he, or e'er
a bug of his country.&endq;</P>
<P>When he had rung out his fir&s;t alarm, I
told him I was &s;orry he had allowed him&s;elf
to be &s;o jockied; but it was no bu&s;ine&s;s of
mine; and that the fellow who robbed
him of his bride, had likewi&s;e robbed me
of my &s;ervant&mdash;&startq;Didn't I tell you then,
(cried he,) that Rogue was his true
Chri&s;tian name.&mdash;Oh if I had but one
<PB N="209" REF="211">
fair tru&s;t with him upon the &s;od, I'd
give him lave to brag all the re&s;t of his
life.&endq;</P>
<P>My uncle hearing the noi&s;e, came in,
and being informed of this adventure,
began to comfort Mr. Oneale for the la|dy's
elopement; ob&s;erving that he &s;eem|ed
to have had a lucky e&s;cape, that it was
better &s;he &s;hould elope before, than after
marriage&mdash;The Hibernian was of a very
different opinion. He &s;aid, &startq;If he had
been once married, &s;he might have
eloped as &s;oon as &s;he plea&s;ed; he would
have taken care that &s;he &s;hould not
have carried her fortune along with
her&mdash;Ah (&s;aid he) &s;he's a Judas I&s;cariot,
and has betrayed me with a ki&s;s; and,
like Judas, &s;he carried the bag, and
has not left me money enough to bear
my expences back to London; and &s;o
as I'm come to this pa&s;s, and the rogue
that was the occa&s;ion of it has left you
without a &s;arvant, you may put me in
his place; and by Ja&s;us, it is the be&s;t
thing you can do.&mdash;&endq; I begged to be
excu&s;ed, declaring I could put up with
any inconvenience, rather than treat as a
footman the de&s;cendant of Tir-Owen the
Great. I advi&s;ed him to return to his
friend, Mr. Co&s;grave, and take his pa&s;|&s;age
<PB N="210" REF="212">
from Newca&s;tle by &s;ea, towards
which I made him a &s;mall pre&s;ent, and he
retired, &s;eemingly re&s;igned to his evil for|tune.
I have taken upon trial a Scotchman,
called Archy M 'Alpin, an old &s;oldier,
who&s;e la&s;t ma&s;ter, a colonel, lately died at
Berwick. The fellow is old and wither|ed;
but he has been recommended to me
for his fidelity, by Mrs. Humphreys, a
very good &s;ort of a woman, who keeps
the inn at Tweedmouth, and is much re|&s;pected
by all the travellers on this road.</P>
<P>Clinker, without doubt, thinks him&s;elf
happy in the removal of a dangerous ri|val,
and he is too good a Chri&s;tian, to re|pine
at Dutton's &s;ucce&s;s. Even Mrs. Jen|kins
will have rea&s;on to congratulate her|&s;elf
upon this event, when &s;he cooly re|flects
upon the matter; for, how&s;oever
&s;he was forced from her poi&s;e for a &s;ea|&s;on,
by &s;nares laid for her vanity, Hum|phrey
is certainly the north-&s;tar to which
the needle of her affection would have
pointed at the long run. At pre&s;ent, the
&s;ame vanity is exceedingly mortified, up|on
finding her&s;elf abandoned by her new
admirer, in favour of another innamorata.
She received the news with a violent bur&s;t
of laughter, which &s;oon brought on a fit
of crying; and this gave the fini&s;hing
<PB N="211" REF="213">
blow to the patience of her mi&s;tre&s;s, which
had held out beyond all expectation. She
now opened all tho&s;e floodgates of repre|hen&s;ion,
which had been &s;hut &s;o long.
She not only reproached her with her le|vity
and indi&s;cretion, but attacked her on
the &s;core of religion, declaring roundly
that &s;he was in a &s;tate of apo&s;tacy and re|probation;
and finally, threatened to &s;end
her a-packing at this extremity of the
kingdom. All the family interceded for
poor Winifrid, not even excepting her
&s;lighted &s;wain, Mr. Clinker, who, on his
knees, implored and obtained her pardon.</P>
<P>There was, however, another con&s;ide|ration
that gave Mrs. Tabitha &s;ome di&s;|turbance.
At Newca&s;tle, the &s;ervants
had been informed by &s;ome wag, that
there was nothing to eat in Scotland, but
<HI>oat-meal</HI> and <HI>&s;heep's-heads;</HI> and Lieutenant
Li&s;mahago being con&s;ulted, what he &s;aid
&s;erved rather to confirm than to refute the
report. Our aunt being appri&s;ed of this
circum&s;tance, very gravely advi&s;ed her
brother to provide a &s;umpter hor&s;e with
&s;tore of hams, tongues, bread, bi&s;cuit,
and other articles for our &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, in
the cour&s;e of our peregrination, and Mr.
Bramble as gravely replied, that he would
take the hint into con&s;ideration: but, find|ing
<PB N="212" REF="214">
no &s;uch provi&s;ion was made, &s;he now
revived the propo&s;al, ob&s;erving that there
was a tolerable market at Berwick, where
we might be &s;upplied; and that my man's
hor&s;e would &s;erve as a bea&s;t of burthen&mdash;
The '&s;quire, &s;hrugging up his &s;houlders,
eyed her a&s;kance with a look of inef|fable
contempt; and, after &s;ome pau&s;e,
&startq;Si&s;ter, (&s;aid he) I can hardly per|&s;uade
my&s;elf you are &s;erious.&endq; She
was &s;o little acquainted with the geo|graphy
of the i&s;land, that &s;he ima|gined
we could not go to Scotland but by
&s;ea; and, after we had pa&s;&s;ed through the
town of Berwick, when he told her we
were upon Scotti&s;h ground, &s;he could
hardly believe the a&s;&s;ertion&mdash;If the truth
mu&s;t be told, the South Britons in gene|ral
are woefully ignorant in this particu|lar.
What, between want of curio&s;ity,
and traditional &s;arca&s;ms, the effect of an|cient
animo&s;ity, the people at the other
end of the i&s;land know as little of Scot|land
as of Japan.</P>
<P>If I had never been in Wales, I &s;hould
have been more &s;truck with the manife&s;t
difference in appearance betwixt the pea|&s;ants
and commonalty on different &s;ides
of the Tweed. The boors of Northum|berland
are lu&s;ty fellows, fre&s;h comple|xioned,
cleanly, and well cloathed; but
<PB N="213" REF="215">
the labourers in Scotland are generally
lank, lean, hard-featured, &s;allow, &s;oiled,
and &s;habby, and their little pinched blue
caps have a beggarly effect. The cattle
are much in the &s;ame &s;tile with their driv|ers,
meagre, &s;tunted, and ill equipt.
When I talked to my uncle on this &s;ub|ject,
he &s;aid, &startq;Though all the Scotti&s;h
hinds would not bear to be compared
with tho&s;e of the rich counties of South
Britain, they would &s;tand very well in
competition with the pea&s;ants of France,
Italy, and Savoy&mdash;not to mention the
mountaineers of Wales, and the red-&s;hanks
of Ireland.&endq;</P>
<P>We entered Scotland by a frightful
moor of &s;ixteen miles, which promi&s;es
very little for the interior parts of the
kingdom; but the pro&s;pect mended as
we advanced. Pa&s;&s;ing through Dunbar,
which is a neat little town, &s;ituated on the
&s;ea-&s;ide, we lay at a country inn, where
our entertainment far exceeded our ex|pectation;
but for this we cannot give
the Scots credit, as the landlord is a native
of England. Ye&s;terday we dined at Had|dington,
which has been a place of &s;ome
con&s;ideration, but is now gone to decay;
and in the evening arrived at this metro|polis,
of which I can &s;ay very little. It
<PB N="214" REF="216">
is very romantic, from its &s;ituation on the de|clivity
of a hill, having a fortified ca&s;tle
at the top, and a royal palace at the bot|tom.
The fir&s;t thing that &s;trikes the no&s;e
of a &s;tranger, &s;hall be namele&s;s; but
what fir&s;t &s;trikes the eye, is the uncon&s;cion|able
height of the hou&s;es, which gene|rally
ri&s;e to five, &s;ix, &s;even, and eight
&s;tories, and, in &s;ome places, (as I am a&s;|&s;ured)
to twelve. This manner of build|ing,
attended with numberle&s;s inconve|niences,
mu&s;t have been originally owing
to want of room. Certain it is, the town
&s;eems to be full of people: but their
looks, their language, and their cu&s;toms,
are &s;o different from ours, that I can
hardly believe my&s;elf in Great-Bri|tain.</P>
<P>The inn at which we put up, (if it
may be &s;o called) was &s;o filthy and di&s;|agreeable
in all re&s;pects, that my uncle be|gan
to fret, and his gouty &s;ymptoms to
recur&mdash;Recollecting, however, that he
had a letter of recommendation to one
Mr. Mitchel&s;on, a lawyer, he &s;ent it by
his &s;ervant, with a compliment, import|ing
that he would wait upon him next
day in per&s;on; but that gentleman vi&s;it|ed
us immediately, and in&s;i&s;ted upon our
going to his own hou&s;e, until he could
<PB N="215" REF="217">
provide lodgings for our accommodation.
We gladly accepted of his invitation, and
repaired to his hou&s;e, where we were
treated with equal elegance and ho&s;pitali|ty,
to the utter confu&s;ion of our aunt,
who&s;e prejudices, though beginning to give
way, were not yet entirely removed. To|day,
by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of our friend, we are
&s;ettled in convenient lodgings, up four
pair of &s;tairs, in the High-&s;treet, the
fourth &s;tory being, in this city, reckoned
more genteel than the fir&s;t. The air is,
in all probability, the better; but it re|quires

<OPENER>To Dr. LEWIS.
DEAR LEWIS,</OPENER>
<P>THAT part of Scotland contiguous
to Berwick, nature &s;eems to have intend|ed
as a barrier between two ho&s;tile na|tions.
It is a brown de&s;ert of con&s;idera|ble
extent, that produces nothing but
heath and fern; and what rendered it the
more dreary when we pa&s;&s;ed, there was
a thick fog that hindered us from &s;eeing
above twenty yards from the carriage&mdash;
My &s;i&s;ter began to make wry faces, and
u&s;e her &s;melling-bottle; Liddy looked
blank, and Mrs. Jenkins dejected; but in
a few hours the&s;e clouds were di&s;&s;ipated;
the &s;ea appeared upon our right, and on
the left the mountains retired a little,
leaving an agreeable plain betwixt them
and the beach; but, what &s;urpri&s;ed us
all, this plain, to the extent of &s;everal
miles, was covered with as fine wheat as
ever I &s;aw in the mo&s;t fertile parts of
<PB N="217" REF="219">
South Britain&mdash;This plentiful crop is
rai&s;ed in the open field, without any in|clo&s;ure,
or other manure than the <HI>alga
marina,</HI> or &s;ea-weed, which abounds on
this coa&s;t; a circum&s;tance which &s;hews
that the &s;oil and climate are favourable;
but that agriculture in this country is not
yet brought to that perfection which it
has attained in England. Inclo&s;ures
would not only keep the grounds warm,
and the &s;everal fields di&s;tinct, but would al|&s;o
protect the crop from the high winds,
which are &s;o frequent in this part of the
i&s;land.</P>
<P>Dunbar is well &s;ituated for trade, and
has a curious ba&s;on, where &s;hips of &s;mall
burthen may be perfectly &s;ecure; but
there is little appearance of bu&s;ine&s;s in
the place&mdash;From thence, all the way to
Edinburgh, there is a continual &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion
of fine &s;eats, belonging to noblemen
and gentlemen; and as each is &s;urround|ed
by its own parks and plantation, they
produce a very plea&s;ing effect in a coun|try
which lies otherwi&s;e open and expo&s;|ed.
At Dunbar there is a noble park,
with a lodge, belonging to the Duke of
Roxburgh, where Oliver Cromwell had
his head-quarters, when Le&s;ley, at the
head of a Scotch army, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
<PB N="218" REF="220">
of the mountains in the neighbourhood,
and hampered him in &s;uch a manner,
that he would have been obliged to em|bark
and get away by &s;ea, had not the fa|natici&s;m
of the enemy forfeited the ad|vantage
which they had obtained by their
general's conduct&mdash;Their mini&s;ters, by
exhortation, prayer, a&s;&s;urance, and pro|phecy,
in&s;tigated them to go down and
&s;lay the Phili&s;tines in Gilgal, and they
quitted their ground accordingly, not|with&s;tanding
all that Le&s;ley could do to
re&s;train the madne&s;s of their enthu&s;ia&s;m
&mdash;When Oliver &s;aw them in motion,
he exclaimed, &startq;Prai&s;ed be the Lord, he
hath delivered them into the hands of
his &s;ervant!&endq; and ordered his troops to
&s;ing a p&s;alm of thank&s;giving, while they
advanced in order to the plain, where
the Scots were routed with great &s;laugh|ter.</P>
<P>In the neighbourhood of Haddington,
there is a gentleman's hou&s;e, in the build|ing
of which, and the improvements a|bout
it, he is &s;aid to have expended forty
thou&s;and pounds: but I cannot &s;ay I was
much plea&s;ed with either the architec|ture
or the &s;ituation; though it has in
front a pa&s;toral &s;tream, the banks of
which are laid out in a very agreeable
<PB N="219" REF="221">
manner. I intended to pay my re&s;pects
to lord Elibank, whom I had the honour
to know at London many years ago. He
lives in this part of Lothian; but was
gone to the North, on a vi&s;it&mdash;You have
often heard me mention this nobleman,
whom I have long revered for his huma|nity
and univer&s;al intelligence, over and
above the entertainment ari&s;ing from the
originality of his character&mdash;At Mu&s;&s;el|burgh,
however, I had the good-fortune
to drink tea with my old friend Mr. Car|donel;
and at his hou&s;e I met with Dr.
C&mdash;, the par&s;on of the pari&s;h, who&s;e
humour and conver&s;ation inflamed me
with a de&s;ire of being better acquainted
with his per&s;on&mdash;I am not at all &s;urpri&s;ed
that the&s;e Scots make their way in every
quarter of the globe.</P>
<P>This place is but four miles from
Edinburgh, towards which we proceeded
along the &s;ea-&s;hore, upon a firm bottom
of &s;mooth &s;and, which the tide had left
uncovered in its retreat&mdash;Edinburgh,
from this avenue, is not &s;een to much
advantage&mdash;We had only an imperfect
view of the Ca&s;tle and upper parts of the
town, which varied ince&s;&s;antly according
to the inflexions of the road, and exhibit|ed
the appearance of detached &s;pires and
<PB N="220" REF="222">
turrets, belonging to &s;ome magnificent
edifice in ruins. The palace of Holy|rood
hou&s;e &s;tands on the left, as you en|ter
the Canongate&mdash;This is a &s;treet con|tinued
from hence to the gate called Ne|ther
Bow, which is now taken away; &s;o
that there is no interruption for a long
mile, from the bottom to the top of the
hill on which the Ca&s;tle &s;tands in a mo&s;t
imperial &s;ituation&mdash;Con&s;idering its fine
pavement, its width, and the lofty hou&s;es
on each &s;ide, this would be undoubtedly
one of the noble&s;t &s;treets in Europe, if
an ugly ma&s;s of mean buildings, called
the Lucken-Booths, had not thru&s;t it&s;elf,
by what accident I know not, into the
middle of the way, like Middle-Row in
Holborn. The city &s;tands upon two hills,
and the bottom between them; and, with
all its defects, may very well pa&s;s for
the capital of a moderate kingdom&mdash;It is
full of people, and continually re&s;ounds
with the noi&s;e of coaches and other carri|ages,
for luxury as well as commerce.
As far as I can perceive, here is no want
of provi&s;ions&mdash;The beef and mutton are
as delicate here as in Wales; the &s;ea af|fords
plenty of good fi&s;h; the bread is
remarkably fine; and the water is excel|lent,
though I'm afraid not in &s;ufficient
<PB N="221" REF="223">
quantity to an&s;wer all the purpo&s;es of
cleanline&s;s and convenience; articles in
which, it mu&s;t be allowed, our fellow-&s;ub|jects
are a little defective&mdash;The water is
brought in leaden pipes from a mountain
in the neighbourhood, to a ci&s;tern on the
Ca&s;tle-hill, from whence it is di&s;tributed
to public conduits in different parts of
the city&mdash;From the&s;e it is carried in bar|rels,
on the backs of male and female por|ters,
up two, three, four, five, &s;ix, &s;e|ven,
and eight pair of &s;tairs, for the u&s;e
of particular families&mdash;Every &s;tory is a
complete hou&s;e, occupied by a &s;eparate
family; and the &s;tair being common to
them all, is generally left in a very filthy
condition; a man mu&s;t tread with great
circum&s;pection to get $afe hou&s;ed with
unpolluted &s;hoes&mdash;Nothing can form a
&s;tronger contra&s;t, than the difference be|twixt
the out&s;ide and in&s;ide of the door;
for the good-women of this metropolis
are remarkably nice in the ornaments and
propriety of their apartments as if they
were re&s;olved to transfer the imputation
from the individual to the public. You
are no &s;tranger to their method of di&s;|charging
all their impurities from their
windows, at a certain hour of the night,
as the cu&s;tom is in Spain, Portugal, and
<PB N="222" REF="224">
&s;ome parts of France and Italy&mdash;A prac|tice
to which I can by no mear$s be re|conciled;
for notwith&s;tanding all the care
that is taken by their &s;cavengers to re|move
this nui&s;ance every morning by
break of day, enough &s;till remains to of|fend
the eyes, as well as other organs of

<P>The inhabitants &s;eem in&s;en&s;ible to the&s;e

affectation; but they ought to have &s;ome
compa&s;&s;ion for &s;trangers, who have not been
U&s;ed to this kind of &s;ufferance; and con&s;i|der,
whether it may not be worth while to
take &s;ome pains to vindicate them&s;elves
from the reproach that, on this account,
they bear among their neighbours. As to
the &s;urpri&s;ing height of their hou&s;es, it is
ab&s;urd in many re&s;pects; but in one par|ticular

that is, the dreadful &s;ituation of all
the families above, in ca&s;e the common
&s;tair ca&s;e &s;hould be rendered impa&s;&s;able
by a fire in the lower &s;tories&mdash;In order to
prevent the &s;hocking con&s;equences that

a right mea&s;ure to open doors of commu|nication
from one hou&s;e to another, on

<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bar^^t. of
Je&s;us college, Oxon.
DEAR PHILLIPS,</OPENER>
<P>IF I &s;tay much longer at Edinburgh,
I &s;hall be changed into a down-right Cale|donian&mdash;My
uncle ob&s;erves, that I have
already acquired &s;omething of the coun|try
accent. The people here are &s;o &s;oci|al
and attentive in their civilities to &s;tran|gers,
that I am in&s;en&s;ibly &s;ucked into the
channel of their manners and cu&s;toms,
although they are in fact much more dif|ferent
from ours than you can imagine&mdash;
That difference, however, which &s;truck
me very much at my fir&s;t arrival, I now
hardly perceive, and my ear is perfectly
reconciled to the Scotch accent, which I
find even agreeable in the mouth of a
pretty woman&mdash;It is a &s;ort of Doric dia|lect,
which gives an idea of amiable &s;im|plicity&mdash;You
cannot imagine how we
have been care&s;&s;ed and fea&s;ted in the
<HI>good town of Edinburgh,</HI> of which we are
<PB N="230" REF="232">
become free denizens and guild bro|thers,
by the &s;pecial favour of the ma|gi&s;tracy.</P>
<P>I had a whim&s;ical commi&s;&s;ion from
Bath, to a citizen of this metropolis&mdash;
Quin, under&s;tanding our intention to vi|&s;it
Edinburgh, pulled out a guinea, and
de&s;ired the favour I would drink it at a
tavern, with a particular friend and bot|tle-companion
of his, one Mr. R&mdash;C&mdash;,
a lawyer of this city&mdash;I charged my&s;elf
with the commi&s;&s;ion, and, taking the
guinea, &startq;You &s;ee (&s;aid I) I have pocket|ed
your bounty.&endq; &startq;Yes (replied
Quin, laughing); and a head-ake in|to
the bargain, if you drink fair.&endq; I
made u&s;e of this introduction to Mr.
C&mdash;, who received me with open arms,
and gave me the rendezvous, according
to the cartel. He had provided a company
of jolly fellows, among whom I found
my&s;elf extremely happy; and did Mr.
C&mdash;and Quin all the ju&s;tice in my
power; but, alas, I was no more than a
tiro among a troop of veterans, who had
compa&s;&s;ion upon my youth, and convey|ed
me home in the morning, by what
means I know not&mdash;Quin was mi&s;taken,
however, as to the head-ake; the claret
was too good to treat me &s;o roughly.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="233">
While Mr. Bramble holds conferences
with the graver literati of the place, and
our females are entertained at vi&s;its by
the Scotch ladies, who are the be&s;t and
kinde&s;t creatures upon earth, I pa&s;s my
time among the bucks of Edinburgh;
who, with a great &s;hare of &s;pirit and vi|vacity,
have a certain &s;hrewdne&s;s and
&s;elf-command that is not often found
among their neighbours, in the high-day
of youth and exultation&mdash;Not a hint
e&s;capes a Scotchman that can be inter|preted
into offence by any individual in
the company; and national reflections are
never heard&mdash;In this particular, I mu&s;t
own, we are both unju&s;t and ungrateful
to the Scots; for, as far as I am able to
judge, they have a real e&s;teem for the na|tives
of South-Britain; and never men|tion
our country, but with expre&s;&s;ions of
regard&mdash;Neverthele&s;s, they are far from
being &s;ervile imitators of our modes and
fa&s;hionable vices. All their cu&s;toms and
regulations of public and private oecono|my,
of bu&s;ine&s;s and diver&s;ion, are in their
own &s;tile. This remarkably predomi|nates
in their looks, their dre&s;s, and man|ner,
their mu&s;ic, and even their cookery.
Our '&s;quire declares, that he knows not
another people upon earth, &s;o &s;trongly
<PB N="232" REF="234">
marked with a national character&mdash;Now
we are upon the article of cookery, I
mu&s;t own, &s;ome of their di&s;hes are &s;avou|ry,
and even delicate; but I am not yet
Scotchman enough to reli&s;h their &s;inged
&s;heep's-head and haggice, which were
provided at our reque&s;t, one day at Mr.
Mitchel&s;on's, where we dined&mdash;The fir&s;t
put me in mind of the hi&s;tory of Congo,
in which I had read of negros' heads &s;old
publickly in the markets; the la&s;t, being
a me&s;s of minced lights, livers, &s;uet, oat-meal,
onions, and pepper, inclo&s;ed in a
&s;heep's &s;tomach, had a very &s;udden effect
upon mine, and the delicate Mrs. Tabby
changed colour; when the cau&s;e of our
di&s;gu&s;t was in&s;tantaneou&s;ly removed at
the nod of our entertainer. The Scots,
in general, are attached to this compo&s;i|tion,
with a &s;ort of national fondne&s;s, as
well as to their oat-meal bread; which is
pre&s;ented at every table, in thin triangu|lar
cakes, baked upon a plate of iron,
called a girdle; and the&s;e, many of the
natives, even in the higher ranks of life,
prefer to wheaten-bread, which they have
here in perfection&mdash;You know we u&s;ed to
vex poor Murray of Baliol-college, by
a&s;king, if there was really no fruit but
turnips in Scotland?&mdash;Sure enough, I
<PB N="233" REF="235">

not as a de&s;ert, but by way of <HI>hors d'
oeuvres,</HI> or whets, as radi&s;hes are &s;erved
up betwixt more &s;ub&s;tantial di&s;hes in
France and Italy; but it mu&s;t be ob&s;erv|ed,
that the turnips of this country are
as much &s;uperior in &s;weetne&s;s, delicacy,
and flavour, to tho&s;e of England, as a
mu&s;k-melon is to the &s;tock of a common
cabbage. They are &s;mall and conical, of
a yellowi&s;h colour, with a very thin &s;kin;
and, over and above their agreeable ta&s;te,
are valuable for their anti&s;corbutic qua|lity&mdash;As
to the fruit now in &s;ea&s;on, &s;uch
as cherries, goo&s;eberries, and currants,
there is no want of them at Edinburgh;
and in the gardens of &s;ome gentlemen,
who live in this neighbourhood, there is
now a very favourable appearance of apri|cots,
peaches, nectarines, and even
grapes: nay, I have &s;een a very fine
&s;hew of pine-apples within a few miles
of this metropolis. Indeed, we have no
rea&s;on to be &s;urpri&s;ed at the&s;e particulars,
when we con&s;ider how little difference
there is, in fact, betwixt this climate and
that of London.</P>
<P>All the remarkable places in the city
and its avenues, for ten miles around, we
have vi&s;ited, much to our &s;atisfaction. In
<PB N="234" REF="236">
the Ca&s;tle are &s;ome royal apartments,
where the &s;overeign occa&s;ionally re&s;ided;
and here are carefully pre&s;erved the re|galia
of the kingdom, con&s;i&s;ting of a

and a &s;word of &s;tate, adorned with
jewels&mdash;Of the&s;e &s;ymbols of &s;overeignty,
the people are exceedingly jealous&mdash;A
report being &s;pread, during the &s;itting of
the union-parliament, that they were re|moved
to London, &s;uch a tumult aro&s;e,
that the lord commi&s;&s;ioner would have
been torn in pieces, if he had not pro|duced
them for the &s;atisfaction of the po|pulace.</P>
<P>The palace of Holyrood hou&s;e is an
elegant piece of architecture, but &s;unk in
an ob&s;cure, and, as I take it, unwhole|&s;ome
bottom, where one would imagine
it had been placed on purpo&s;e to be con|cealed.
The apartments are lofty, but
unfurni&s;hed; and as for the pictures of
the Scotti&s;h kings, from Fergus I. to
king William&punc; they are paultry daubings,
mo&s;tly by the &s;ame hand, painted either
from the imagination, or porters hired
to &s;it for the purpo&s;e. All the diver&s;ions
of London we enjoy at Edinburgh, in a

meet plays on the flute, the violin, or
violoncello; and there is one nobleman,
who&s;e compo&s;itions are univer&s;ally ad|mired&mdash;Our
company of actors is very
tolerable; and a &s;ub&s;cription is now on
foot for building a new theatre; but their
a&s;&s;emblies plea&s;e me above all other pub|lic
exhibitions.</P>
<P>We have been at the hunters ball,
where I was really a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee &s;uch

but, I can declare with a &s;afe con|&s;cience,
I never &s;aw &s;o many hand&s;ome

Between friends, is has &s;u&s;tained &s;ome

was accompanied by the agreeable mi&s;s
Grieve, who made many conque&s;ts; nor
did my &s;i&s;ter Liddy pa&s;s unnoticed in the
a&s;&s;emby&mdash;She is become a toa&s;t at Edin|burgh,
by the name of the Fair Cam|brian,
and has already been the occa&s;ion
of much wine-&s;hed; but the poor girl
met with an accident at the ball, which
has given us great di&s;turbance.</P>
<P>A young gentleman, the expre&s;s image
of that ra&s;cal Wil&s;on, went up to a&s;k her
to dance a minuet; and his &s;udden ap|pearance
&s;hocked her &s;o much, that &s;he
fainted away&mdash;I call Wil&s;on a ra&s;cal, be|cau&s;e,
if he had been really a gentleman,
with honourable intentions, he would
have, ere now, appeared in his own cha|racter&mdash;I
mu&s;t own, my blood boils with
indignation when I think of that fellow's
pre&s;umption; and Heaven confound me
if I don't&mdash;But I won't be &s;o womani&s;h as
to rail&mdash;Time will, perhaps, furni&s;h oc|ca&s;ion&mdash;Thank
God, the cau&s;e of Lid|dy's
di&s;order remains a &s;ecret. The lady
directre&s;s of the ball, thinking &s;he was
overcome by the heat of the place, had
her conveyed to another room, where
&s;he &s;oon recovered &s;o well, as to return
<PB N="237" REF="239">
and join in the country-dances, in which
the Scotch la&s;&s;es acquit them&s;elves with
&s;uch &s;pirit and agility, as put their par|ners
to the height of their mettle&mdash;I be|lieve
our aunt, Mrs. Tabitha, had en|tertained
hopes of being able to do &s;ome
execution among $he cavaliers at this a&s;|&s;embly&mdash;She
had been &s;everal days in
con&s;ultation with milliners and mantua|makers,
preparing for the occa&s;ion, at
which &s;he made her appearance in a full
&s;uit of dama&s;k, &s;o thick and heavy, that
the &s;ight of it alone, at this &s;ea&s;on of the
year, was &s;ufficient to draw drops of &s;weat
from any man of ordinary imagination&mdash;
She danced one minuet with our friend,
Mr. Mitchel&s;on, who favoured her &s;o far,
in the &s;pirit of ho&s;pitality and politene&s;s;
and &s;he was called out a &s;econd time by
the young laird of Ballymawhawple, who,
coming in by accident, could not readily
find any other partner; but as the fir&s;t
was a married man, and the &s;econd pay|ed
no particular homage to her charms,
which were al&s;o over-looked by the re&s;t
of the company, &s;he became di&s;&s;atisfied
and cen&s;orious&mdash;At &s;upper, &s;he ob&s;erved
that the Scotch gentlemen made a very
good figure, when they were a little im|proved
by travelling; and therefore it
<PB N="238" REF="240">
was pity they did not all take the benefit
of going abroad&mdash;She &s;aid the women
were aukward, ma&s;culine creatures; that,
in dancing, they lifted their legs like &s;o
many colts; that they had no idea of
graceful motion, and put on their clothes
in a frightful manner; but if the truth
mu&s;t be told, Tabby her&s;elf was the mo&s;t
ridiculous figure, and the wor&s;t dre&s;&s;ed
of the whole a&s;&s;embly&mdash;The neglect of
the male &s;ex rendered her malcontent
and peevi&s;h; &s;he now found fault with
every thing at Edinburgh, and teized her
brother to leave the place, when &s;he was
&s;uddenly reconciled to it on a religious
con&s;ideration&mdash;There is a &s;ect of fana|ticks,
who have &s;eparated them&s;elves
from the e&s;tabli&s;hed kirk, under the name
of Seceders&mdash;They acknowledge no earth|ly
head of the church, reject lay-patron|age,
and maintain the methodi&s;t doctrines
of the new birth, the new light, the ef|ficacy
of grave, the in&s;ufficiency of works,
and the operations of the &s;pirit. Mrs.
Tabitha, attended by Humphry Clinker,
was introduced to one of their conven|ticles,
where they both received much e|dification;
and &s;he has had the good
fortune to come acquainted with a pious
Chri&s;tian, called Mr. Moffat, who is very
<PB N="239" REF="241">
powerful in prayer, and often a&s;&s;i&s;ts her
in private exerci&s;es of devotion.</P>
<P>I never &s;aw &s;uch a concour&s;e of gen|teel
company at any races in England, as
appeared on the cour&s;e of Leith&mdash;Hard
by, in the fields called the Links, the
citizens of Edinburgh divert them&s;elves
at a game called golf, in which they u&s;e
a curious kind of bats, tipt with horn,
and &s;mall ela&s;tic balls of leather, &s;tuffed
with feathers, rather le&s;s than tennis
balls, but of a much harder con&s;i&s;tence
&mdash;This they &s;trike with &s;uch force and
dexterity from one hole to another, that
they will fly to an incredible di&s;tance. Of
this diver&s;ion the Scots are &s;o fond, that
when the weather will permit, you may
&s;ee a multitude of all ranks, from the &s;e|nator
of ju&s;tice to the lowe&s;t trade&s;men,
mingled together in their &s;hirts, and fol|lowing
the balls with the utmo&s;t eager|ne&s;s&mdash;Among
others, I was &s;hewn one
particular &s;et of golfers, the younge&s;t of
whom was turned of four&s;core&mdash;They
were all gentlemen of independent for|tunes,
who had amu&s;ed them&s;elves with
this pa&s;time for the be&s;t part of a cen|tury,
without having ever felt the lea&s;t
alarm from &s;ickne&s;s or di&s;gu&s;t; and they
never went to bed, without having each
<PB N="240" REF="242">
the be&s;t part of a gallon of claret in his
belly. Such uninterrupted exerci&s;e, co|operating
with the keen air from the
&s;ea, mu&s;t, without all doubt, keep the
appetite always on edge, and &s;teel the con|&s;titution
again&s;t all the common attacks
of di&s;temper.</P>
<P>The Leith races gave occa&s;ion to an|other
entertainment of a very &s;ingular na|ture&mdash;There
is at Edinburgh a &s;ociety or
corporation of errand-boys, called caw|dies,
who ply in the &s;treets at night with
paper lanthorns, and are very &s;ervice|able
in carrying me&s;&s;ages&mdash;The&s;e fellows,
though &s;habby in their appearance, and
rudely familiar in their addre&s;s, are won|derfully
acute, and &s;o noted for fidelity,
that there is no in&s;tance of a cawdy's hav|ing
betrayed his tru&s;t&mdash;Such is their in|telligence,
that they know, not only eve|ry
individual of the place, but al&s;o every
&s;tranger, by that time he has been four
and twenty hours in Edinburgh; and no
tran&s;action, even the mo&s;t private, can
e&s;cape their notice&mdash;They are particular|ly
famous for their dexterity in executing
one of the functions of Mercury; though,
for my own part, I never employed them
in this department of bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;Had I oc|ca&s;ion
for any &s;ervice of this nature, my
<PB N="241" REF="243">
own man Archy M'Alpine, is as well
qualified as e'er a cawdie in Edinburgh;
and I am much mi&s;taken, if he has not
been heretofore of their fraternity. Be
that as it may, they re&s;olved to give a
dinner and a ball at Leith, to which they
formally invited all the young noblemen
and gentlemen that were at the races;
and this invitation was reinforced by an
a&s;&s;urance that all the celebrated ladies of
plea&s;ure would grace the entertainment
with their company.&mdash;I received a card
on this occa&s;ion, and went thither with
half a dozen of my acquaintance.&mdash;In a
large hall the cloth was laid on a long
range of tables joined together, and here
the company &s;eated them&s;elves, to the
number of about four&s;core, lords, and
lairds, and other gentlemen, courtezans
and cawdies mingled together, as the
&s;laves and their ma&s;ters were in the time
of the Saturnalia in ancient Rome.&mdash;The
toa&s;tma&s;ter, who &s;at at the upper end,
was one Cawdie Fra&s;er, a veteran pimp,
di&s;tingui&s;hed for his humour and &s;agacity,
well known and much re&s;pected in his
profe&s;&s;ion by all the gue&s;ts, male and fe|male,
that were here a&s;&s;embled.&mdash;He had
be&s;poke the dinner and the wine: he had
<PB N="242" REF="244">
taken care that all his brethren &s;hould ap|pear
in decent apparel and clean linen;
and he him&s;elf wore a periwig with three
tails, in honour of the fe&s;tival&mdash;I a&s;&s;ure
you the banquet was both elegant and
plentiful, and &s;ea&s;oned with a thou&s;and
&s;allies, that promoted a general &s;pirit of
mirth and good humour.&mdash;After the de|&s;ert,
Mr. Fra&s;er propo&s;ed the following
toa&s;ts, which I don't pretend to explain.&mdash;
&startq;The be&s;t in Chri&s;tendom.&endq;&mdash;&startq;Gibb's
contract.&endq;&mdash;&startq;The beggar's benni&s;on.&endq;
&mdash;&startq;King and kirk.&endq;&mdash;&startq;Great-Britain
and Ireland.&endq;&mdash;Then, filling a
bumper, and turning to me, &startq;Me&s;ter
Malford, (&s;aid he) may a' unkindne&s;s
cea&s;e betwixt John Bull and his &s;i&s;ter
Moggy.&endq;&mdash;The next per&s;on he &s;ingled
out, was a nobleman who had been
long abroad.&mdash;&startq;Ma lord, (cried Fra&s;er)
here is a bumper to a' tho&s;e noblemen
who have virtue enough to &s;pend their
rents in their ain countray.&endq;&mdash;He af|terwards
addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to a member
of parliament in the&s;e words:&mdash;&startq;Me&s;ter
&mdash;I'm &s;ure ye'll ha' nae objection to my
drinking, Di&s;grace and dule to ilka
Scot, that &s;ells his con&s;cience and his
vote.&endq;&mdash;He di&s;charged a third &s;arca&s;m
<PB N="243" REF="245">
at a per&s;on very gaily dre&s;&s;ed, who had
ri&s;en from &s;mall beginnings, and made a
con&s;iderable fortune at play.&mdash;Filling his
gla&s;s, and calling him by name, &startq;Lang
life (&s;aid he) to the wylie loon that
gangs a-field with a toom poke at his
lunzie, and comes hame with a &s;ack|ful
of &s;iller.&endq;&mdash;All the&s;e toa&s;ts being
received with loud bur&s;ts of applau&s;e,
Mr. Fra&s;er called for pint gla&s;&s;es, and
filled his own to the brim: then &s;tanding
up, and all his brethren following his ex|ample,
&startq;Ma lords and gentlemen (cried
he), here is a cup of thanks for the
great and unde&s;erved honour you have
done your poor errand-boys this day.&endq;
&mdash;So &s;aying, he and they drank off their
gla&s;&s;es in a trice, and, quitting their &s;eats,
took their &s;tation each behind one of the
other gue&s;ts;&mdash;exclaiming, &startq;Noo we're
your honours cawdies again.&endq;</P>
<P>The nobleman who had bore the fir&s;t
brunt of Mr. Fra&s;er's &s;atire, objected to
his abdication. He &s;aid, as the company
was a&s;&s;embled by invitation from the
cawdies, he expected they were to be en|tertained
at their expence. &startq;By no
means, my lord, (cried Fra&s;er) I wad
na be guilty of &s;ic pre&s;umption for the
<PB N="244" REF="246">
wide warld&mdash;I never affronted a gen|tleman
&s;ince I was born; and &s;ure at
this age, I wonnot offer an indignity to
&s;ic an honourable convention.&endq; &startq;Well,
(&s;aid his Lord&s;hip) as you have expend|ed
&s;ome wit, you have a right to &s;ave
your money. You have given me good
coun&s;el, and I take it in good part. As
you have voluntarily quitted your &s;eat,
I will take your place with the leave of
the good company, and think my&s;elf
happy to be hailed, <HI>Father of the Fea&s;t.</HI>&endq;
He was forthwith elected into the chair,
and complimented in a bumper in his new
character.</P>
<P>The claret continued to circulate with|out
interruption, till the gla&s;&s;es &s;eemed to
dance upon the table, and this, perhaps,
was a hint to the ladies to call for mu&s;ic&mdash;
At eight in the evening the ball began in
another apartment: at midnight we went
to &s;upper; but it was broad day before I
found the way to my lodgings; and, no
doubt, his Lord&s;hip had a &s;winging bill
to di&s;charge.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I have lived &s;o riotou&s;ly for
&s;ome weeks, that my uncle begins to be
alarmed on the &s;core of my con&s;titution,
and very &s;eriou&s;ly ob&s;erves, that all his
<PB N="245" REF="247">
own infirmities are owing to &s;uch exce&s;&s;es
indulged in his youth&mdash;Mrs. Tabitha &s;ays
it would be more for the advantage of my
&s;oul as well as body, if, in&s;tead of fre|quenting
the&s;e &s;cenes of debauchery, I
would accompany Mr. Moffat and her to
hear a &s;ermon of the reverend Mr.
M'Corkindale.&mdash;Clinker often exhorts
me, with a groan, to take care of my
precious health; and even Archy M'Al|pine,
when he happens to be overtaken,
(which is oftener the ca&s;e than I could
wi&s;h) reads me a long lecture upon tem|perance
and &s;obriety; and is &s;o very wi&s;e
and &s;ententious, that, if I could provide
him with a profe&s;&s;or's chair, I would will|ingly
give up the benefit of his admoni|tions
and &s;ervice together; for I was tutor|&s;ick
at alma mater.</P>
<P>I am not, however, &s;o much engro&s;&s;ed
by the ga$eties of Edinburgh, but that I
find time to make parties in the family
way.&mdash;We have not only &s;een all the vil|las
and villages within ten miles of the ca|pital,
but we have al&s;o cro&s;&s;ed the Firth,
which is an arm of the &s;ea &s;even miles
broad, that divides Lothian from the
&s;hire, or, as the Scots call it, the
<HI>kingdom of Fife.</HI> There is a number of
<PB N="246" REF="248">
large open &s;ea-boats that ply on this pa&s;|&s;age
from Leith to Kinghorn, which is a
borough on the other &s;ide. In one of
the&s;e our whole family embarked three
days ago, excepting my &s;i&s;ter, who, being
exceedingly fearful of the water, was left
to the care of Mrs. Mi$chel&s;on. We had
an ea&s;y and quick pa&s;&s;age into Fife, where
we vi&s;ited a number of poor towns on the
&s;ea-&s;ide, including St. Andrew's, which is
the &s;keleton of a venerable city; but we
were much better plea&s;ed with &s;ome noble
and elegant &s;eats and ca&s;tles, of which
there is a great number in that part of
Scotland. Ye&s;terday we took boat again
on our return to Leith, with fair wind and
agreeable weather; but we had not ad|vanced
half-way when the &s;ky was &s;ud|denly
overca&s;t, and the wind changing,
blew directly in our teeth; &s;o that we
were obliged to turn, or tack the re&s;t of
the way. In a word, the gale increa&s;ed
to a &s;torm of wind and rain, attended with
&s;uch a fog, that we could not &s;ee the
town of Leith, to which we were bound,
nor even the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh, not|with&s;tanding
its high &s;ituation. It is not
to be doubted but that we were all alarm|ed
on this occa&s;ion. And at the &s;ame
<PB N="247" REF="249">
time, mo&s;t of the pa&s;&s;engers were &s;eized
with a nau&s;ea that produced violent retch|ings.
My aunt de&s;ired her brother to
order the boatmen to put back to King|horn,
and this expedient he actually pro|po&s;ed;
but they a&s;&s;ured him there was no
danger. Mrs. Tabitha finding them ob|&s;tinate,
began to &s;cold, and in&s;i&s;ted upon
my uncle's exerting his authority as a
ju&s;tice of the peace. Sick and peevi&s;h as
he was, he could not help laughing at this
wi&s;e propo&s;al, telling her, that his com|mi&s;&s;ion
did not extend &s;o far, and, if it
did, he &s;hould let the people take their
own way; for he thought it would be
great pre&s;umption in him to direct them
in the exerci&s;e of their own profe&s;&s;ion.
Mrs. Winifred Jenkins made a general
clearance with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mr. Hum|phrey
Clinker, who joined her both in
prayer and ejaculation.&mdash;As he took it for
granted that we &s;hould not be long in this
world, he offered &s;ome &s;piritual con&s;ola|tion
to Mrs. Tabitha, who rejected it with
great di&s;gu&s;t, bidding him keep his &s;er|mons
for tho&s;e who had lei&s;ure to hear
&s;uch non&s;en&s;e.&mdash;My uncle &s;at, recollected
in him&s;elf, without &s;peaking; my man
Archy had recour&s;e to a brandy-bottle,
with which he made &s;o free, that I ima|gined
<PB N="248" REF="250">
he had &s;worn to die of drinking
any thing rather than &s;ea-water: but the
brandy had no more effect upon him in
the way of intoxication, than if it had
been &s;ea water in good earne&s;t.&mdash;As for
my&s;elf, I was too much engro&s;&s;ed by the
&s;ickne&s;s at my &s;tomach, to think of any
thing el&s;e.&mdash;Meanwhile the &s;ea &s;welled
mountains high, the boat pitched with
&s;uch violence, as if it had been going to
pieces; the cordage rattled, the wind
roa$ed; the lightning fla&s;hed, the thun|der
be$$owed, and the rain de&s;cended in
a deluge&mdash;Every time the ve&s;&s;el was put
about, we &s;hip'd a &s;ea that drenched us
all to the &s;kin.&mdash;When, by dint of turn|ing,
we thought to have cleared the pier
head, we were driven to leeward, and
then the boatmen them&s;elves began to
fear that the tide would fail before we
&s;hould fetch up our lee-way: the next
trip, however, brought us into &s;mooth wa|ter,
and we were &s;afely landed on the
quay, about one o'clock in the afternoon.
&mdash;&startq;To be &s;ure (cried Tabby, when &s;he
found her&s;elf on <HI>t$rra firma,</HI>) we mu&s;t
all have peri&s;hed, if we had not been
the particular care of Providence.&endq;&mdash;&startq;
Yes, (replied my uncle) but I am much
of the hone&s;t highlander's mind&mdash;af|ter
<PB N="249" REF="251">
he had made &s;uch a pa&s;&s;age as this:
his friend told him he was much in|debted
to Providence;&endq;&mdash;&startq;Certainly,
(&s;aid Donald) but, by my &s;aul, mon, I'&s;e
ne'er trouble Providence again, &s;o long
as the brig of Stirling &s;tands.&endq;&mdash;
You mu&s;t know the brig, or bridge of
Stirling, &s;tands above twenty miles up the
river Forth, of which this is the outlet&mdash;
I don't find that our '&s;quire has &s;uffered
in his health from this adventure; but
poor Liddy is in a peaking way&mdash;I'm
afraid this unfortunate girl is unea&s;y in
her mind; and this apprehen&s;ion di&s;tracts
me, for &s;he is really an amiable creature.</P>
<P>We &s;hall &s;et out to-morrow or next day
for Stirling and Gla&s;gow; and we pro|po&s;e
to penetrate a little way into the
Highlands, before we turn our cour&s;e to
the &s;outhward&mdash;In the mean time, com|mend
me to all our friends round Carfax,
and believe me to be, ever yours,</P>
