<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHatever Reluctance I have to trouble the
Publick, with a Detail of the Mortifications
I have &s;uffered, in my Attempts to bring the en|&s;uing
Performance on the Stage; I think it a Duty
incumbent upon me, to declare my Rea&s;ons for
pre&s;enting it in this extraordinary Manner; and
if the Explanation &s;hall be found either tedious or
trifling, I hope the candid Reader will charge my
Impertinence upon tho&s;e who drove me to the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of making &s;uch an ineffectual Appeal.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, I flatter my&s;elf, that a fair Repre&s;enta|tion
of the U&s;age I have met with, will be as a
Beacon, to caution other inexperienced Authors
again&s;t the In&s;incerity of Managers, to which they
might otherwi&s;e become egregious Dupes; and,
after a cajoling Dream of good Fortune, wake in
all the Aggravation of Di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>Although I claim no Merit from having fini&s;hed
a Tragedy at the Age of Eighteen; I cannot help
thinking my&s;elf intitled to &s;ome &s;hare of Indul|gence,
for the Humility, Indu&s;try and Patience,
I have exerted during a Period of ten Years, in
which this unfortunate Production hath been expo|&s;ed
to the Cen&s;ure of Criticks of all Degrees; and
in Con&s;equence of their &s;everal Opinions, altered,
and (I hope) amended Times without Number.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="3">
Had &s;ome of tho&s;e who were plea&s;ed to call
them&s;elves my Friends, been at any Pains to de&s;erve
the Character, and told me ingenuou&s;ly what I had
to expect in the Capacity of an Author, when I
fir&s;t profe&s;&s;ed my&s;elf of that venerable Fraternity,
I &s;hould in all Probability, have &s;pared my&s;elf the
incredible Labour and Chagrin I have &s;ince under|gone:
But as early as the Year 1739, my Play
was taken into the Protection of one of tho&s;e little
Fellows who are &s;ometimes called great Men; and
like other Orphans, neglected accordingly.</P>
<P>Stung with Re&s;entment, which I mi&s;took for
Contempt, I re&s;olved to puni&s;h this barbarous In|difference,
and actually di&s;carded my Patron; con|&s;oling
my&s;elf with the barren Prai&s;e of a few A&s;|&s;ociates,
who, in the mo&s;t indefatigable Manner,
employed their Time and Influence, in collecting
from all Quarters Ob&s;ervations on my Piece, which,
in con&s;equence of tho&s;e Sugge&s;tions, put on a new
Appearance almo&s;t every Day, until my Occa&s;ions
called me out of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>&mdash;Soon after my Return, I and my Production
were introduced to a late Patentee, of courteous
Memory, who (re&s;t his Soul!) found Means to
amu&s;e me a whole Sea&s;on, and then declared it
impracticable to bring it on till next Year; ad|vi&s;ing
me to make my Application more early in
the Winter, that we might have Time to concert
&s;uch Alterations, as &s;hould be thought nece&s;&s;ary
for its &s;ucce&s;sful Appearance on the Stage.&mdash;But
I did not find my Account in following this whole|&s;ome
Advice; for, to me, he was always le&s;s and
le&s;s at Lei&s;ure. In &s;hort after &s;undry Promi&s;es,
and numberle&s;s Eva&s;ions, in the Cour&s;e of which,
he practi&s;ed upon me the whole Art of Procra&s;|tination,
<PB N="v" REF="4">
I demanded his final An&s;wer, with &s;uch
Ob&s;tinacy and Warmth, that he could no longer
re&s;i&s;t my Importunity, and refu&s;ed my Tragedy
in plain Terms.&mdash;Not that he mentioned any ma|terial
Objections to the Piece it&s;elf; but &s;eemed
to fear my Intere&s;t was not &s;ufficient to &s;upport it
in the Repre&s;entation; affirming, that no drama|tic
Compo&s;ition, however perfect, could &s;ucceed
with an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Audience by its own Merit only;
but mu&s;t entirely depend upon a Faction rai&s;ed
in its Behalf.&mdash;Incen&s;ed at this unexpected Declara|tion,
I reproached him bitterly, for having trifled
with me &s;o long; and, like my Brother <HI>Bayes,</HI>
threaten'd to carry my Performance to the other
Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>This was actually my Intention, when I was
given to under&s;tand by a Friend, that an Noble|man
of great Weight, had expre&s;&s;ed an Inclina|tion
to peru&s;e it; and that, as Intere&s;t was requi|&s;ite,
I could not do better than gratify his De&s;ire
with all Expedition. I committed it accordingly
to the Care of my Coun&s;ellor, who undertook to
give me a good Account of it in le&s;s than a
Fortnight: But four Months elap&s;ed before I heard
any Tidings of my Play; and then it was retrieved
by pure Accident (I believe) from the mo&s;t di&s;ho|nourable
Apartment of his Lord&s;hip's Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Enraged at the Behaviour of this &s;upercilious Peer,
and exceedingly mortified at the Mi&s;carriage of all
my Efforts, I wreaked my Re&s;entment upon the
innocent Cau&s;e of my Di&s;graces, and forthwith
condemned it to Oblivion, where in all Probability,
it would have for ever &s;lept, like a mi&s;erable Abor|tion;
had not a young Gentleman of Learning
and Ta&s;te waked my paternal Sen&s;e, and per|&s;waded
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
me not only to re&s;cue it from the Tomb,
where it had lain two whole Years; but al&s;o to
new model the Plan, which was imperfect and un|dige&s;ted
before, and mould it into a regular Trage|dy,
confined within the Unites of the Drama.</P>
<P>Thus improved, it fell into the Hands of a Gen|tleman
who had wrote for the Stage, and happened
to plea&s;e him &s;o much, that he &s;poke of it very
cordially to a young Nobleman, &s;ince decea&s;ed, who
in the mo&s;t generous Manner, charged him&s;elf
with the Care of introducing it to the Pub|lick;
and, in the mean time, honour'd me with
his own Remarks, in Conformity to which, it was
immediately altered, and offered by his Lord&s;hip to
the new Manager of <HI>Drury-lane</HI> Theatre. It was
about the latter End of the Sea&s;on, when this can|did
Per&s;onage, to whom I owe many Obligations
for the Exerci&s;es of Patience he has &s;et me, received
the Performance, which, &s;ome Weeks after, he
returned, a&s;&s;uring my Friend, that he was pre-in|gaged
to another Author, but if I could be pre|vailed
upon to re&s;erve it 'till the en&s;uing Winter,
he would bring it on.&mdash;In the Interim, my noble
Patron left <HI>London,</HI> whither he was doomed never
to return; and the con&s;cientious Manager next
Sea&s;on, in&s;tead of fulfilling his own Promi&s;e and
my Expectation, gratified the Town with the Pro|duction
of a Player, the Fate of which every Body
knows.</P>
<P>I &s;hall leave the Reader to make his Reflections
on this Event, and proceed to relate the other Par|ticulars
of Fortune, that attended my unhappy
I&s;&s;ue, which in the &s;ucceeding Spring, had the good
Luck to acquire the Approbation of an eminent
Wit, who propo&s;ed a few Amendments, and re|commended
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
it to a Per&s;on, by who&s;e Influence, I
laid my Account with &s;eeing it appear at la&s;t, with
&s;uch Advantage as &s;hould make ample Amends
for all my Di&s;appointments.</P>
<P>But here too, I reckoned without my Ho&s;t. The
Ma&s;ter of <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> Theatre, bluntly reject|ed
it, as a Piece altogether unfit for the Stage; even
after he had told me, in Pre&s;ence of another Gentle|man,
that he believed he &s;hould not venture to find
Fault with any Performance which had gained the
good Opinion of the honourable Per&s;on who ap|proved
and recommended my Play.</P>
<P>Baffled in every Attempt, I renounced all Hopes
of its &s;eeing the Light, when a humane Lady of
Quality, interpo&s;ed &s;o urgently in its Behalf, with
my worthy Friend the other Manager, that he very
complai&s;antly received it again, and had Recour&s;e
to the old My&s;tery of Protraction, which he exer|ci&s;ed
with &s;uch Succe&s;s, that the Sea&s;on was almo&s;t
con&s;umed, before he could afford it a Reading.&mdash;
My Patience being by this Time quite exhau&s;ted,
I de&s;ired a Gentleman, who intere&s;ted him&s;elf in
my Concerns, to go and expo&s;tulate with the Va|ticide:
And indeed, this piece of Friend&s;hip he per|formed
with &s;o much Zeal, upbraiding him with
his eva&s;ive and pre&s;umptuous Behaviour, that the
&s;age Politician was enraged at his Reprimand; and
in the Mettle of his Wrath, pronounced my Play a
wretched Piece, deficient in Language, Sentiment,
Character and Plan. My Friend, who was &s;urpri|&s;ed
at the Hardne&s;s and Severity of this Sentence,
a&s;king how he came to change his Opinion, which
had been more favourable when the Tragedy was
fir&s;t put into his Hands; he an&s;wered, that his Opi|nion
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
was not altered, neither had he ever uttered
an Expre&s;&s;ion in its Favour.</P>
<P>This was an unlucky A&s;&s;ertion&mdash;For, the other
immediately produced a Letter which I had receiv|ed
from the young Nobleman two years before, be|ginning
with the&s;e Words&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;Sir, I have received Mr. <HI>L</HI>&mdash;'s An&s;wer; who
&s;ays, he thinks your Play has indubitable Merit,
but has prior Promi&s;es to Mr. <HI>T&mdash;n,</HI> as an hone&s;t
Man, cannot be evaded.&endq;&mdash;And concluding thus;
&startq;As the Manager has promi&s;ed me the Choice of
the Sea&s;on next Year, if you'll be advi&s;ed by me,
re&s;t it with me.&endq;</P>
<P>After having made &s;ome Remarks &s;uitable to the
Occa&s;ion, my Friend left him to chew the Cud of
Reflection, the Re&s;ult of which was, a Me&s;&s;age to
my Patrone&s;s, importing, (with many Expre&s;&s;ions
of Duty) that neither the Circum&s;tances of his
Company, nor the advanced Sea&s;on of the Year,
would permit him to obey her Command, but if I
would wait till next Winter, and during the Sum|mer,
make &s;uch Alterations as I had agreed to, at
a Conference with &s;ome of his principal Performers,
he would a&s;&s;uredly put my Play in Rehear&s;al, and
in the mean time give me an Obligation in Writ|ing,
for my further Satisfaction.&mdash;I would have
taken him at his Word, without He&s;itation, but
was per&s;uaded to di&s;pen&s;e with the proffered Secu|rity,
that I might not &s;eem to doubt the Influence
or Authority of her Lady&s;hip.&mdash;The Play (how|ever)
was altered and pre&s;ented to this upright Di|rector,
who renounced his Engagement, without
the lea&s;t Scruple, Apology or Rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="8">
Thus have I in the mo&s;t impartial Manner, (per|haps
too circum&s;tantially) di&s;played the Conduct of
tho&s;e Play-hou&s;e Managers with whom I have had
any Concern, relating to my Tragedy: And what|ever
Di&s;putes have happened between the Actors
and me, are &s;uppre&s;&s;ed as frivolous Animo&s;ities un|worthy
of the Reader's Attention.</P>
<P>Had I &s;uffered a Repul&s;e when I fir&s;t pre&s;ented
my Performance, I &s;hould have had Cau&s;e to com|plain
of my being excluded from that Avenue to the
public Favour, which ought to lie open to all Men
of Genius; and how far I de&s;erve that Di&s;tinction,
I now leave the World to decide; after I have in
Ju&s;tice to my&s;elf, declared that my Hopes of Suc|ce&s;s
were not derived from the partial Applau&s;e, of
my own Friends only, but in&s;pired (as &s;ome of my
greate&s;t Enemies know) by the Approbation of
Per&s;ons of the fir&s;t Note in the Republic of Ta&s;te;
who&s;e Countenance, I vainly imagined, would have
been an effectual Introduction to the Stage.</P>
<P>Be that as it will; I hope the unprejudiced Ob|&s;erver
will own, with Indignation and Di&s;dain, that
every Di&s;appointment I have endured, was an ac|cumulated
Injury; and the whole of my Adver&s;a|ry's
Conduct, a Series of the mo&s;t unju&s;tifiable E|quivocation
and in&s;olent Ab&s;urdity: For, though
he may be excu&s;able in refu&s;ing a Work of this
kind, either on Account of his Ignorance or Di&s;|cernment;
&s;urely, neither the one nor the other
can vindicate his Di&s;&s;imulation and Breach of Pro|mi&s;e
to the Author.</P>
<P>Abu&s;e of Prerogative, in Matters of greater Im|portance,
prevails &s;o much at pre&s;ent, and is &s;o ge|nerally
<PB N="x" REF="9">
overlooked, that it is almo&s;t ridiculous to
lament the Situation of Authors, who mu&s;t either,
at once, forego all Opportunities of acquiring Re|putation
in Dramatic Poetry; or humble them|&s;elves
&s;o, as to &s;ooth the Pride, and Humour the
Petulance of a meer <HI>Goth,</HI> who by the mo&s;t pre|po&s;terous
Delegation of Power, may become &s;ole
Arbiter of this kind of Writing.</P>
<P>Nay granting that a Bard is willing to pro&s;titute
his Talents &s;o &s;hamefully, perhaps he may never
find an Occa&s;ion to practice this vile Conde&s;cen&s;ion
to Advantage: For, after he has gained Admi&s;&s;ion
to a Patentee, who is often more difficult of Acce&s;s
than a Sovereign Prince, and even made Shift to
remove all other Objections; an in&s;urmountable
Ob&s;tacle may be rai&s;ed by the Manager's Avarice,
which will di&s;&s;uade him from hazarding a certain
Expence on an uncertain I&s;&s;ue, when he can fill
his Theatre without running any Ri&s;k, or di&s;oblig|ing
his principal Actors, by putting them to the
trouble of &s;tudying new Parts.&mdash;</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, he will be apt to &s;ay within him&s;elf,
&startq;If I mu&s;t entertain the Town with Variety, it
is but natural that I &s;hould prefer the Produc|tions
of my Friends, or of tho&s;e who have any
Friends worth obliging, to the Works of ob|&s;cure
Strangers, who have nothing to recom|mend
them but a doubtful Superiority of Merit,
which in all likelihood, will never ri&s;e in Judg|ment
again&s;t me.&endq;</P>
<P>That &s;uch have been the Reflections of Paten|tees,
I believe no Man of Intelligence and Veraci|ty
will deny; and I will venture to affirm, that on
<PB N="xi" REF="10">
the Strength of Intere&s;t or Connection with the
Stage, &s;ome People have commenced Dramatic
Authors, who otherwi&s;e, would have employed
their Faculties in Exerci&s;es better adapted to their
Capacity.</P>
<P>&mdash;After what has been &s;aid, any thing by way
of Application would be an In&s;ult on the Under|&s;tanding
of the Public, to which I owe and ac|knowledge
the mo&s;t indelible Obligation, for
former Favours as well as for the uncommon En|couragement
I have received in the Publication
of the following Play.</P>
