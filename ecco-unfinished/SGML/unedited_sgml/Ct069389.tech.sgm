<HEAD>THE
QUARREL
OF THE
School-Boys
AT
ATHENS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_IN the Days of the
ancient Philo&s;ophers,
when People acted by
the Light of Nature;
and when Rea&s;on was
the Guide of Politici|ans,
as State Maxims are now, a
Grave In&s;tructor of others told the
<PB N="2" REF="3">
following Story for the Ends and
Purpo&s;es, for which it was proper to
be made U&s;e of.</P>
<P>There was, &s;aid he, in <HI>Pelepone&s;&s;us,</HI>
a certain <HI>Grecian</HI> Schoolma&s;ter, who
taught Philo&s;ophy to his Scholars
in his own City, and with very
great Succe&s;s and Reputation; He
was a Per&s;on of great Excellency in
him&s;elf, famed for his Wi&s;dom and
for his Experience, and e&s;pecially for
his Dextcrity in the Government of
his School, and for his exqui&s;ite
Skill in the In&s;tructing his Scho|lars;
and as this had gain'd him
great Applau&s;e in the Country
where he dwelt, &s;o it had made his
Name very much talk'd of, and
re&s;pected in other Parts of the
World; He had a very great School
in his own Country, which he had
enjoyed for many Years, and of
which his Father had been School|ma&s;ter
before him; indeed his Father
was a very good Schoolma&s;ter in
his Time, but was &s;o out&s;hin'd by
the Excellencies of his Son, that the
World &s;eem'd to remember him, <HI>as
it were,</HI> only for the Honour he had
<PB N="3" REF="4">
to introduce &s;o extraordinary a
Per&s;on, <HI>as his Son was,</HI> into the
World.</P>
<P>In Proce&s;s of Time, <HI>Fate,</HI> who
&s;ingles out Men from their Birth,
determining them for great Things
fir&s;t, and then fini&s;hing them for
the great Works they are determin'd
to do: I &s;ay, <HI>Fate</HI> and the Decrees
<HI>of the Immortal Gods,</HI> which nothing
can with&s;tand, had handed on the
Fame of this great In&s;tructor, to a
Neighbouring Commonwealth, and
had &s;o effectually recommended his
Per&s;on, his Endowments, and par|ticularly
that of his being &s;o ex|ceedingly
qualified for the Govern|ment
of Youth, more than other
Men; That upon the Vacancy of
the greate&s;t and mo&s;t famous School
in tho&s;e Parts of the World, he was
by the unanimous Suffrage of the
Senate and People of that Coun|try,
fir&s;t nominated to that Po&s;t;
which, to be &s;hort, in Proce&s;s of
Time, he was afterwards call'd to,
and went over the Sea, (for it was
on the other Side of the Gulph,) to
take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of; where he was
<PB N="4" REF="5">
received with the joyful Acclamation
of the People of the Country.</P>
<P>It was true, and perhaps was
one Rea&s;on of the exceeding Joy of
the People on his Arrival, I &s;ay, <HI>it
was true,</HI> that after he was thus no|minated
to this School, and before
the Schoolma&s;ter's Place became
vacant, his Intere&s;t was oppo&s;ed by
&s;ome of the idle&s;t, and mo&s;t ignorant
of the Scholars, who were appre|hen&s;ive
of being kept under a &s;trict|er
Di&s;cipline, than they had been
u&s;ed to in the former Time; and
who loving their Vices, and e&s;peci|ally
Indulging their Neglect of Lear|ning,
were loth to &s;ubmit to &s;uch a
regular Government of the School,
as they expected from him; The&s;e
laid &s;everal Plots, got together into
Parties, and form'd &s;everal De&s;igns,
to have prevented the new School|ma&s;ter's
taking Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
School; nay, &s;o $ar had they carri|ed
on their Projects, that, after his
Coming, they offered great Di&s;tur|bance
to him, in&s;omuch, that con|trary
to his inclination, which was
to have taught them Obedience by
<PB N="5" REF="6">
Precepts and Per&s;wa&s;ions, rather
than by Coertion and Di&s;cipline;
he was obliged to take the Rod and
the Ferula in his Hand, almo&s;t a&s;-&s;oon
as he came into the School;
and fir&s;t, whereas at his very En|trance,
he found &s;ome Dunces and
illiterate Youths, and who, he
thought, were placed too high in
the School, beyond the Proficiency
they had arriv'd to; The&s;e he be|gan
with, and immediately di&s;plac|ing
them, cau&s;ed them to go back
to the lower Cla&s;&s;es, from whence
they had been too ha&s;tily rai&s;ed by
the Favour, rather than Judgment,
of the former Pedagogues.</P>
<P>This bred &s;ome bad Blood in the
School, and &s;ome of them took it
&s;o ill, that they left the School up|on
it, and rai&s;ed Reproaches and
Slanders again&s;t the good Govern|ment
of the Schoolma&s;ter, which
made him indeed a great many Ene|mies
in that Country: Others of
them behav'd &s;o ill in the Cla&s;&s;es
to which they were removed, that
there was no bearing them, and he
<PB N="6" REF="7">
was oblig'd to cau&s;e them to be
expell'd the School.</P>
<P>But as the&s;e Things are Matter
of Hi&s;tory, and would carry us too
far back into the Conduct of the&s;e
Youths, in the Time of the former
Schoolma&s;ters, Things which do
not relate much to the pre&s;ent De|&s;ign,
they are therefore omitted, to
proceed with the Story.</P>
<P>The Schoolma&s;ter having with an
inimitable Dexterity managed the
turbulent Spirits of the&s;e Youths;
and having purg'd the School, &s;o
that all the higher Cla&s;&s;es, upon
which depended the good Order of
the whole, were fill'd with VERY
GOOD BOYS; and having e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd
&s;uch Rules of Government
and Di&s;cipline in the School, as he
thought might be mo&s;t effectual to
pre&s;erve the Peace of the School,
he made his Only Son USHER of
the School; and taking Boat, went
over the Gulph into his Native
Country, to vi&s;it and &s;et in Order
the School he had le&s;t there.</P>
<P>His Son was a Per&s;on of &s;ome
Proficiency in Learning, but he was
<PB N="7" REF="8">
Young, and not &s;o fully experienc'd,
as his Father was, in the Art of go|verning
a School of &s;uch a Magni|tude;
and e&s;pecially where the up|per
Youths had been &s;o long out of
Government, and &s;o accu&s;tom'd to an
ill Habit of &s;elf-Management; How|ever,
the old <HI>Preceptor</HI> believing that
in Duty to him, and to pre&s;erve the
Oeconomy of the School, and above
all, from the Love which the &s;aid
Scholars of the Upper Cla&s;&s;es profe&s;s'd
for his Son, he might be ea&s;ie, and
need not que&s;tion, but they would
keep the School in very good Order,
and that the Son would have the
Reputation of having managed well
in the Ab&s;ence of his Father.</P>
<P>Indeed the People without Doors,
&s;aid the old Schoolma&s;ter was not at
all in the wrong, to tru&s;t the elder
Scholars as A&s;&s;i&s;tants to the <HI>&V;SHER,</HI>
in the good Government of the School;
for that their Wi&s;dom and Prudence,
their Vigilance and good Manage|ment
in that Affair, would exceeding|ly
recommend them, not to their Head
Schoolma&s;ter only at his Return, but
to all the Families in the Country,
(in the mean time,) who&s;e Children
<PB N="8" REF="9">
being entru&s;ted to their Di&s;cipline, in
the lower Cla&s;&s;es of the School, had
a very ju&s;t Concern in the Peace and
good Admini&s;tration of Things
during the Ab&s;ence of the Head
Schoolma&s;ter.</P>
<P>But <HI>alas!</HI> all the&s;e good Mea&s;ures
and wi&s;e Di&s;po&s;itions were not able
to pre&s;erve the Peace and Government
of the School; For no &s;ooner was
the old Gentleman's Back turn'd, but
the School became a Scene of Confu|&s;ion
and Di&s;order; not that the Con|duct
of the <HI>&V;SHER</HI> can be reflect|ed
on, who did his be&s;t, according to
the utmo&s;t of his Skill and Capacity,
to have pre&s;erv'd the Harmony and
good Under&s;taning of the Senior
Boys. But <HI>alas!</HI> they de&s;pi&s;ed his
Youth, and his want of Authority to
puni&s;h them; they al&s;o &s;aid &s;ome very
ill-natured Things of him, with Re|&s;pect
to his Judgment, in teaching
and in&s;tructing the Boys; Tho' this
was very di&s;obliging, and the <HI>&V;SH|ER</HI>
was not quite de&s;titute of good
Intelligence in the Ca&s;e, yet he con|cealed
his Re&s;entment for the pre&s;ent,
and from time to time laid it all be|fore
his Father, re&s;olving to receive
all his In&s;tructions from his own Hand.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="10">
It mu&s;t be ob&s;erv'd here; for Ju|&s;tice
mu&s;t be done as we go along,
that we do not find any of the Di&s;|orders,
of which we are now giving
an Account, proceeded from Di&s;like
of the Government of the School|ma&s;ter,
Di&s;re&s;pect to his Per&s;on, or
Di&s;gu&s;t at his Way of Teaching; nor
were there any of the&s;e Boys con|cern'd
in it at fir&s;t, who had been
concern'd in oppo&s;ing his coming to
take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the School, after he
had been nominated to it as above;
for all tho&s;e had, as has been noted,
either run away for Fear of being
whipp'd, or been expell'd the School
at fir&s;t, or were at lea&s;t mix'd &s;o up
and down among the lower Cla&s;&s;es of
the School, as that they had no Inte|re&s;t
in the&s;e things, and were &s;carce
known among the re&s;t.</P>
<P>On the contrary, the Youths of
whom we are now to &s;peak, were
chiefly of tho&s;e, who having te&s;tified
their Affection to their new Ma&s;ter,
even before his Coming; and run the
Ri&s;que of being ill treated for their
Fidelity, during the late di&s;orderly
Government of the School, had been
<PB N="10" REF="11">
now placed at the Head of the &s;everal
Cla&s;&s;es, as the Reward of their for|mer
good Conduct; nay, &s;ome of
them had really been expell'd the
School on that Account; a Treat|ment
which &s;ignifies the highe&s;t Di&s;|&s;atisfaction
and Di&s;plea&s;ure of the
Schoolma&s;ter, and is a Di&s;grace which,
to <HI>a good Boy,</HI> is much more mortify|ing
and afflicting, than the ordinary
Correction of the School.</P>
<P>To de&s;cend a little to Particulars:
One of the&s;e was Captain of the Ma|thematical
Form or Cla&s;s. Hi&s;tory has
not recorded his Name, nor indeed
the Names of any of the Scholars;
neither in Things done &s;o many Ages
ago, and in &s;o remote a Part of the
World, would tho&s;e Names be of any
Signification to us at this Time; we
&s;hall therefore content our &s;elves with
&s;uch De&s;criptions of their &s;everal Cha|racters,
and Stations in the School, as
the Relation we have met with fur|ni&s;hes
us with; from whence we &s;hall
gather enough to di&s;tingui&s;h the Per|&s;ons;
&s;o that the Reader may know
any of them, as they meet with their
Characters in the telling the Story,
<PB N="11" REF="12">
and &s;o as may let us far enough into
the &s;everal Circum&s;tances of their fu|ture
Conduct on this Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e Scholars, as is &s;aid,
was Captain of the Mathematical
Form or Cla&s;s, which being the fir&s;t
in the whole School, he was by Con|&s;equence
call'd <HI>Captain General</HI> of all
the Boys: He was of an antient Race
among the <HI>Greeks,</HI> a &s;prightly, vigo|rous
Youth, of wonderful Vivacity
and Spirit; he had a Genius for great
things, and his peculiar Study was in
tho&s;e Parts of the Mathematicks, which
relate to <HI>the Art of War;</HI> &s;uch as
<HI>fortifying of Towns, encamping of Ar|mies,
and Managing great Enterprizes;</HI>
he had obtain'd &s;uch a great Chara|cter
in his Studies, that it was thought
he was fit to have led on the greate&s;t
Armies; he had <HI>a cool Head,</HI> and <HI>a
warm Heart;</HI> and in a Word, as he
delighted in great Actions, &s;o he di&s;|charged
him&s;elf in the greate&s;t Affairs
of the School with &s;uch Dexterity,
that he kept all the tumultuous, cla|mouring
Cla&s;&s;es that were under him
in great Awe: He was no le&s;s a Po|litician,
than a Youth of Action; for
<PB N="12" REF="13">
he had made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of all the
Affairs of <HI>Greece;</HI> he knew the &s;eparate
Intere&s;ts of all the Princes, Cities,
and Commonwealths of <HI>Greece,</HI> as
well as if he had been bred among
them; and in a Word, by the&s;e con|curring
Excellencies in his Capacity,
he had with great Applau&s;e been en|tertain'd
by the new Schoolma&s;ter,
not as an inferiour, and a Pupil, or
Scholar, but rather as a Friend, an
Intimate or Confident, and one on
who&s;e Coun&s;el and Fidelity the Ma&s;ter
might depend in Matters of the great|e&s;t
Con&s;equence: Nor was this Con|fidence
due to his di&s;tingui&s;hing Merit
only; (I mean, as to his Capacity for
Council) but it was in &s;ome Mea&s;ure
due al&s;o to the Merit of his pa&s;t Suf|ferings;
for he had been furiou&s;ly
cha&s;tis'd by the former Schoolma&s;ters
and U&s;hers, and had been per&s;ecuted
by the ince&s;&s;ant Malice of the other
Heads of the Cla&s;&s;es, to that Degree,
that they not only expell'd him from
the School, but even oblig'd him to
fly out of his native City; and all this
ill U&s;age befel him principally, becau&s;e
he very early declar'd him&s;elf for the
<PB N="13" REF="14">
new Schoolma&s;ter, even from his fir&s;t
Nomination, and continued immove|able
to his Intere&s;t to the la&s;t.</P>
<P>Next to him, was a Youth of <HI>Nor|thern</HI>
Extract, of an ancient <HI>Gothick</HI>
Race, who coming from among the
<HI>Barbarians,</HI> had pretended to be ci|viliz'd
in the School of Wi&s;dom a|mong
the <HI>Greeks:</HI> He was of a fiery
Di&s;po&s;ition, and a mo&s;t impetuous
Courage, <HI>as is the known Character of
tho&s;e Nations;</HI> but wanted Temper to
manage that Spirit, which would have
otherwi&s;e been an Ornament to him:
He was ambitious and avaritious, but
managed both with more Policy than
he did his Pa&s;&s;ion: He had long en|vy'd
the Captain of the Mathematick
Cla&s;s, and a&s;pired to be <HI>Captain Gene|ral</HI>
of all the School; nay, in a Word,
he had upon many Occa&s;ions given
to under&s;tand, that nothing le&s;s would
content him: As this was his De&s;ign,
&s;o till he might bring it to pa&s;s, he
&s;hew'd an Impatience of being under
Command, and valued him&s;elf &s;o high,
as to treat tho&s;e who were plac'd a|bove
him, with the utmo&s;t Contempt:
This had cau&s;ed &s;everal Breaches be|tween
<PB N="14" REF="15">
him and the Captains of the
Cla&s;&s;es, that were above him, e&s;peci|ally
in the time of the former School|ma&s;ters,
&s;ome of which were never re|conciled
at all: He had an in&s;inuating
Art in his Conver&s;ation, and had be|hav'd
very well in the Ca&s;e mention'd
before, <HI>viz.</HI> of pre&s;erving the Intere&s;t
of the Ma&s;ter of the School, in the In|terval
between his Nomination and
Acce&s;&s;ion; and for this, as in Point of
Gratitude, was very well accepted
when the Ma&s;ter came to the School;
after this, being of a &s;prightly Temper,
and addicted much to his Plea&s;ures, he
lived very gay and courtly, and with an
uncommon Art, got him&s;elf particu|larly
into the Favour of the <HI>&V;SHER,</HI>
by who&s;e Support he kept him&s;elf very
well al&s;o with the Schoolma&s;ter for a
great while.</P>
<P>To allay the good Qualifications he
was Ma&s;ter of, he had &s;ome dark
Ways with him, which very much
expo&s;ed him; for he very early
drank in wicked Principles, and gave
him&s;elf over to all manner of Vice;
in a Word, he was lewd enough to
have debauch'd the whole School; nor
<PB N="15" REF="16">
had he any Government of him&s;elf in
the&s;e Follies; but being bold and
forward, and, as is &s;aid, of a fiery Di&s;|po&s;ition,
he made him&s;elf a Leader in
Vice, and expected to be followed:
The Schoolma&s;ter, who was a Lover
of Honour, and an Encourager of
Virtue, was &s;oon tir'd of this Youth,
even in Spight of the Inclinations he
had to be kind to him; and having
employ'd him in a Matter of great
Con&s;equence, in which, though he
came off well at la&s;t, yet he had al|mo&s;t
ruin'd the Bu&s;ine&s;s, and him&s;elf
too, by his Ra&s;hne&s;s; I &s;ay, having
acted thus, the Schoolma&s;ter, who
was a true Judge of Merit, let him
know, that he forgave him his Want
of Conduct, for the Sake of the Sin|cerity
of his Intention; but made him
&s;en&s;ible, that he had not acted &s;o as
to de&s;erve abundance of Commenda|tion.
From this Time al&s;o the School|ma&s;ter,
who, I &s;ay, was a perfect
Judge of Merit, abated &s;omething of
the Complacency he had formerly
&s;hewn him; but he, hot, and ambi|tious,
and impatient of Abatement
of Favour, &s;hew'd him&s;elf unea&s;y e|nough,
<PB N="16" REF="17">
and afterwards, on a nice Oc|ca&s;ion,
acted a very &s;ly and &s;ubtil
Part, which gave the Ma&s;ter &s;uch
Di&s;ta&s;t, that he expell'd him the
School, and &s;o got rid of him at once.
It was thought by &s;ome, that the
<HI>&V;&s;her</HI> would have kept him in, as to
that Part of his Scituation in the
School, which HE was concern'd
with him in; but he &s;hew'd too much
Judgment, as well as Duty, for that;
and re&s;olving not to countenance any
Boy in the School, who his Father
appeared di&s;&s;atisfied with, he parted
with him al&s;o; and thus he was re|duced
to his former independent State,
where we &s;hall have but little Occa|&s;ion
to &s;peak of him again; for his
being out of Place made him very un|capable,
though not the le&s;s willing,
to frame a Party in the en&s;uing Di|vi&s;ions.</P>
<P>The
Schoolma&s;ter had yet a third
Favourite among his Scholars, of
whom it is needful to &s;peak &s;ome|thing:
He was a Native of the Coun|try,
and one the Schoolma&s;ter had
heard much of, though he had no
Knowledge of him, as he had of the
<PB N="17" REF="18">
other two before he came over; he
was not equal to the other two in
Birth and Dignity of Family, but &s;u|periour
to many in his Capacities; he
had &s;ignalized him&s;elf by his extraor|dinary
Conduct, and early appearing
in the Intere&s;t of the pre&s;ent School|ma&s;ter,
as much as any Boy in the
School; al&s;o in the Ca&s;e of &s;ome Pri|vileges
of the School, which were in|vaded
during the Government of for|mer
Schoolma&s;ters and U&s;hers; he had
appeared very boldly, and indeed had
been ill u&s;ed by them for it; for they
had him &s;oundly whipp'd, put into
<HI>Dunce</HI>'s Hole, and at la&s;t expell'd the
School; in a Word, they put all the
Indignity po&s;&s;ible upon him, in Hopes
to have made him fly his Country,
as well as the School; but as one of
his Antagoni&s;ts, a Boy of Craft and
Subtilty, &s;aid of him, <HI>that he had a
mo&s;t audacious Courage;</HI> &s;o indeed he
&s;tood &s;toutly up to them, and never
flinched; nay, when he was turned
out of the School, he came up to the
very School Door, and in&s;ulted them
all; and thus he continued to behave
to the la&s;t, till the Vacancy came,
<PB N="18" REF="19">
and the new Schoolma&s;ter took Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion,
and then it was his Turn;
for as the new Schoolma&s;ter em|braced
him with a great deal of Af|fection,
&s;o he gave him the Power to
enquire into, and expo&s;e the Conduct
of tho&s;e, who had oppo&s;ed his Intere&s;t
before his Coming; and he, on the
other Hand, made U&s;e of it; for he
&s;pared none of them, but pu&s;hed at
them with all that Vigour and Fury,
which was natural to his Temper; and
'twas thought many of them fled a|way,
rather becau&s;e they thought he
was implacable, than that the Ma&s;ter
was &s;o: It was &s;aid of the other go|verning
Boys, which u&s;ed this hone&s;t
Boy &s;o cruelly, that they were but &s;orry
Politicians, even in that Particular;
or that it was a Sign they knew little
of the Temper of this Boy, to deal
that Way with him; for had they
known him perfectly, how fierce, how
terrible, and how implacable his Spirit,
they would not have exa&s;perated him;
becau&s;e they could not but know, that
he was one of tho&s;e, who would pay
them Home for it, if ever they came
into his Power.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="20">
The Schoolma&s;ter did not make
him Captain of one of the ordina|ry
Cla&s;&s;es, which &s;ome think had
been a more &s;uitable Station for one
of his Temper, but made him Head
of tho&s;e &s;elected Boys, who he em|ployed
for the greate&s;t Tru&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI>
to keep, receive, and direct the com|mon
Ca&s;h of the School, as well the
ordinary Salary or Revenue of the
Teachers, U&s;her, and Ma&s;ter, as the
extraordinary Money for the Incidents
of the School-Government: In this
Employ he was very faithful, as to
the Money; but as this Po&s;t furni&s;hed
him with extraordinary Power and
Influence over the re&s;t of the Scholars,
&s;o it rai&s;ed him many Enemies, even
in the very School; and particularly
the <HI>Captain General,</HI> and the <HI>Gothick
Captain,</HI> and all that &s;tuck to them,
began to change their Countenances
to him: Without Doors al&s;o there
were Complaints and In&s;inuations made
of him, <HI>viz.</HI> that being of an enter|prizing
Temper, he began to make
Excur&s;ions out of his Po&s;t, and to
top upon, encroach, and invade the
Office of the re&s;t of tho&s;e favourite

Boys, who the Ma&s;ter had entru&s;ted
with the Affairs of the School; nay,
they &s;aid, he could &s;carce refrain from
jo&s;tling with the USHER him&s;elf,
though he was the only Son of the
Schoolma&s;ter: It is true, that this
Boy was innocent of mo&s;t of the
Charge; but his Enemies rai&s;ing fir&s;t
the Report again&s;t him, left him to
clear him&s;elf as well as he could, not
doubting but &s;ome Dirt would &s;tick,
though &s;ome might fall off.</P>
<P>This forward Youth had the good
Fortune to have a Brother in Law,
who, though of another Cla&s;s, was
yet a great A&s;&s;i&s;tant to him; and that
e&s;pecially, as he frequently moderated
the Warmth of his Temper, and a&s;|&s;i&s;ted
him to con&s;ider Things more
&s;edately than he would otherwi&s;e
have done; he was of a better Family,
and of a h$gher Rank than the other,
though a Degree lower in his Station
in the School, being one of the chief
Clerks of the School: He was a Youth
of admirable Integrity, had great and
ju&s;t Ideas of things, and a mo&s;t clear
and penetrating Judgment; he was a
&s;teddy Friend to the Ma&s;ter, and had
<PB N="21" REF="22">
always e&s;pou&s;ed his Intere&s;t in the
Time of the greate&s;t Oppo&s;ition to it,
and was de&s;ervedly therefore placed in
a Po&s;t of as great Tru&s;t as any in the
School; for the Clerks are tho&s;e, thro'
who&s;e Hands mo&s;t of the &s;ecular Bu|&s;ine&s;s
of the School pa&s;&s;es, and are
mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to the Ma&s;ter, to take
off the Hurry of ordinary Matters from
his Mind, that nothing may divert
him from the great Affair of in&s;truct|ing
his Scholars in Ju&s;tice, Virtue, and
the Wor&s;hip of the Gods.</P>
<P>There were &s;ome other flouri&s;hing
Scholars in this famous School, who
had different Studies, and who were
encouraged and advanced in their
Proportion by the Ma&s;ter, <HI>viz.</HI> &s;ome
to the Study of the Laws of their
Country, out of whom the Princes of
tho&s;e Days u&s;ually cho&s;e their Chan|cellors,
Advocates, Coun&s;ellors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
and &s;ome to the &s;acred Offi$e of
Prie&s;ts of <HI>Jupiter.</HI> But of there Hi|&s;tory
has left little or no Remembrance,
except this, that at the coming of
the new Schoolma&s;ter, he &s;ound a ve|ry
&s;candalous, unhappy Wreten, Cap|tain
of this Form; a Boy he was,
<PB N="22" REF="23">
who&s;e principal Merit lay in tho&s;e
Things which wi&s;e Men reject, and
who was advanced to be Captain of
that Cla&s;s, rather becau&s;e he had &s;er|vile,
ba&s;e Principles, which would pro|&s;titute
him to any Drudgery that was
impo&s;ed upon him, than for any Re|&s;pect
tho&s;e who placed him there
really entertained for him; as he was
brought in with a De&s;ign to have him
betray the School, and overthrow the
Intere&s;t of the pre&s;ent Schoolma&s;ter,
&s;o he failed not to run any Lengths
which were required; for he was a
Boy that always loved Wickedne&s;s, nor
did he &s;top at any Mi&s;chief that was
ever propo&s;ed to him: He had arrived
to the Degree he was in, by meer
Eff$ontry and Strength of Forehead;
for he was a mo&s;t prof$$gate Youth
in his Per&s;on, a Contemner of Virtue,
and a Lover of tho&s;e who de&s;troyed
the Temples of the Gods; he had
been expell'd his Father's Hou&s;e for de|filing
a devoted Virgin, and had been
always e&s;teemed a Leader of the Sedi|tious,
and an Enemy to his Country.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="24">
This young Man was ju&s;tly ex|pell'd
the School; but whether it was
the Clemency of the Schoolma&s;ter, or
that his Time was not yet come,
when the Shame which, no doubt,
the ju&s;t Fates have re&s;erved for his Im|piety
&s;hall be brought upon him; I
&s;ay, whether of the&s;e were the Cau&s;e
that he was not then put into the
Hands of Ju&s;tice, Hi&s;tory is altogether
&s;ilent about.</P>
<P>Having expelled this wicked Boy
from the School, the Schoolma&s;ter re|&s;tored
a Youth, who formerly had
been Captain of that Cla&s;s; but was
put out, as above, to make Room for
one, who would pro&s;titute him&s;elf
in a Manner, which it was known the
other would abhor, and do the Drud|gery,
as above, which the other would
not; this Youth had, 'tis true, in his
fir&s;t &s;etting out, deviated in &s;ome
Things from the Rules of Virtue and
Honour; but was &s;ince reformed, and
became a Patron of Virtue in others;
whether he was eminent in the Pra|ctice
of it him&s;elf or not, is not to the
pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="25">
Having thus given the Character of
&s;ome of the Head Boys of the School,
it remains that we go on with the
Story. The Ma&s;ter being thus gone
Abroad, and the Conduct of the School
being left too much in the Power of
the&s;e three or four upper Boys, it
was not long, but not only all the
Harmony and Affection, good Under|&s;tanding
and Unanimity, which at
the Departure of their Ma&s;ter appeared
among them, was lo&s;t; but they, <HI>as
Boys will,</HI> and as indeed <HI>none but Boys
would,</HI> fell all to wrangling, quarrel|ling,
and di&s;puting with one ano|ther,
till the Concern for the publick
Good of the School, which was their
Duty, and ought to have been their
di&s;intere&s;ted Care, was quite forgot,
or turned almo&s;t wholly to the form|ing
of Parties and Intere&s;ts to &s;upplant
and to undermine one another, to
the great endangering the Peace of
the <HI>School,</HI> perplexing the good Hu|mour'd
USHER; and, in a Word,
to the putting the in&s;erior <HI>Scholars</HI> and
<HI>Cla&s;&s;es</HI> into the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion; a
brief Account of &s;ome Part of the&s;e
Things, take as follows:</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="26">
The warlike Youth we mentioned
fir&s;t, had always the &s;uperior Inte|re&s;t
in the Ma&s;ter's Affection; and the
greate&s;t Tru&s;t of his whole Concern
was, next to the <HI>&V;SHER,</HI> repo&s;ed
in him; but it fell out at that Time,
the poor Young Man was taken with
a violent Di&s;temper, which threatned
his Life, and indeed brought him &s;o
low, that he was given over by the
Phy&s;icians; this Di&s;temper was not
only dangerous, but tedious and lin|gring,
and had &s;everal Relap&s;es and
Returns, &s;o that it held him a
long Time, which was a great Blow
to his Intere&s;t; for not his Enemies
only, but even his own Friends, began
to fear he would never recover.</P>
<P>Though it's true, the Seeds of Jea|&s;ou&s;y
and Mi&s;under&s;tanding had been
&s;own a good while among the&s;e
Youths, yet it never &s;o openly &s;hew'd
it &s;elf as upon this Occa&s;ion, almo&s;t
all the other Leaders of the Boys
forming, and now profe&s;&s;ing to be
embark'd in De&s;igns to get into his
Place, as well in the Favour of the
Prince, as in the Advantages he made
of, and Power he had in his Cla&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="27">
It happened well for the <HI>Captain Ge|neral,</HI>
(<HI>as you know he was call'd</HI>) that
three of the be&s;t Friends he had in the
School, and who were always fa&s;t to
his Intere&s;t, went Abroad with, or
&s;oon after to the Schoolma&s;ter; &s;o
that having three &s;uch powerful
Friends with the Ma&s;ter, no one
could offer the lea&s;t Slur upon his
Conduct or Character, but it was im|mediately
taken up, and &s;uch good
Offices done with the Ma&s;ter in his
Behalf, as always pre&s;erv'd his Intere&s;t
flouri&s;hing and invulnerable.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, the Rivals to
his Power were far from being idle;
but as, by Rea&s;on of his Illne&s;s, the
whole Management of the School, at
lea&s;t under the USHER, devolv'd
upon them, or upon other Boys in
their Intere&s;t; &s;o they had Occa&s;ion in
all their Di&s;patches to the School|ma&s;ter,
to lay before him their &s;ecret
Objections again&s;t tho&s;e who acted
under the <HI>Captain General,</HI> not forget|ting
to lay &s;uch Foundations for them|&s;elves
as they found nece&s;&s;ary, in Ca&s;e
of his Decea&s;e, which indeed not they
only, but every one in the School,
<PB N="27" REF="28">
thought inevitable. It is not &s;aid,
whether the fir&s;t and chiefe&s;t Con|tention
began upon the a&s;piring to
his Place, as Captain of the Mathe|matick
Cla&s;s, or as he was the fir&s;t
Per&s;on in, and principal Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or,
next to the <HI>&V;&s;her,</HI> of the Favour
and Affection of the Schoolma&s;ter;
the latter &s;eem'd mo&s;t probable, tho'
we may &s;uppo&s;e it to be both; for we
&s;eldom &s;ee &s;uch Things terminated in
the Compa&s;s of one Point.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing it therefore to be both,
this reduced the main Strife to lye be|tween
the &s;aid Captain General, and
his Intere&s;t on one Hand, and the o|ther
Favourite Boy who kept the
School Ca&s;h, and his Friends and
Dependents on the other.</P>
<P>Like a Fire in a Hou&s;e, which lies
&s;mothering a great while, before it
gets Vent, but creeps with the Help
of Time, and enters its way into the
Rafters and Timber of the Hou&s;e, en|crea&s;ing
its Heat, and drying up all
the Moi&s;ture, till at la&s;t it breaks
out at once into a Flame; &s;o tho&s;e
cunning Boys did not at once fall to|gether
by the Ears, and go to box it
<PB N="28" REF="29">
out, but they managed &s;lily and &s;e|cretly,
engro&s;&s;ing Friends, and draw|ing
by Degrees almo&s;t the whole
School to be concern'd, and to &s;how
them&s;elves on one &s;ide or the other.</P>
<P>The Captain General held his Hold
principally by his Intere&s;t in the
Schoolma&s;ter, but felt a &s;en&s;ible In|jury
to his Cau&s;e in the want of his
Health; and being not &s;o well able to
manage as before, he found the other
Boy gat Ground of him in the School;
for there were &s;o many Boys who had
their Dependance upon the Ca&s;h-keep|er,
or at lea&s;t, he had &s;o many ways
to oblige and &s;erve his Friends, that
great Numbers adher'd to him on
that Account: and be&s;ides that, the
dextrous Management of that Youth,
who was Head Clark of the School,
got Ground for him; in &s;hort, that
one Boy carried all before him, he
di&s;patch'd Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o readily, with
&s;uch Exactne&s;s and Application, that
none ever executed that Office &s;o
much to the common Good; and this
gain'd him &s;uch a Character, and he
de&s;erv'd it &s;o well, that it was thought
<PB N="29" REF="30">
the Schoolma&s;ter could not but have
an exceeding Value for him.</P>
<P>It is certain, that in mo&s;t Govern|ments,
it is &s;ometimes a Crime to
excel; Moderate Merit gets many
Friends, but uncommon Merit rai&s;es
invincible Enemies, and Oppo&s;ition;
for all tho&s;e who cannot come up
to it, find they mu&s;t &s;ink under it,
and therefore vote it dangerous: The
Captain General of the Boys being
now recovered, and come into the
School again, &s;oon found that the
Captain of the Ca&s;hkeepers, &s;upported
by the extraordinary A&s;&s;i&s;tance of his
Brother in Law, began to be formida|ble,
and therefore found, that if he ex|pected
to carry his Point, this Sup|porter
mu&s;t be removed; not that he
had either any Room to form an Ac|cu&s;ation
again&s;t him, or any m$lici|ous
De&s;ire to hurt or de$ame him,
but he found he &s;tood in the Way
of his Intere&s;t, and would, perhaps,
in Time, be fatal to it: and therefore,
as it is &s;aid, he re&s;olv'd he mu&s;t be
removed.</P>
<P>Hi&s;torians differ in the Manner how
this Blow was given. Some relate that
<PB N="30" REF="31">
it was done purely by Defamation
and Slander, repre&s;enting him to the
<HI>Schoolma&s;ter</HI> as turbulent and quarrel|&s;ome
in the <HI>School,</HI> haughty and fierce,
affronting his <HI>Schoolfellows,</HI> pre&s;uming
on the Merit of his <HI>Services,</HI> and his
Intere&s;t with the Ma&s;ter, and &s;uch like;
Others relate, that they got a Propo|&s;al
craftily made to him, about bring|ing
in &s;ome <HI>Foreign</HI> Boys into the
<HI>School,</HI> which the Ma&s;ter had a Kind|ne&s;s
for; and that, on the other Hand,
they as craftily brought him to oppo&s;e
it; and then accu&s;ed him of Di&s;re&s;pect
to the Ma&s;ter: Others relate it
otherwi&s;e; &s;o the Matter is left doubt|ful
in Hi&s;tory; but this they all
agree in, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that without the lea&s;t
previous Notice, without any Reproof,
or the lea&s;t Hint from the Schoolma|&s;ter,
that he was di&s;plea&s;ed with him,
his Quietus was brought over, and
pre&s;ented him, and he was immedi|ately
removed from the Cla&s;s.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the
Confu&s;ion, this &s;udden Blow put all
the School in; The Boys were from
that Time forward all in an Uproar,
no Body knew who would be in, or
<PB N="31" REF="32">
who out, nor did any think him&s;elf
&s;afe; Some believing it was all done
by the Captain General of the Boys,
began to think he would carry all
before him, and therefore willing to
&s;ecure them&s;elves, they run all over
to him, clapt him on the Back, and
cry'd, <HI>G&mdash;d a mercy John:</HI> and &s;o
took Care to be thought his Friends,
if the wor&s;t came to the wor&s;t.</P>
<P>Others chagrin'd at this unu&s;ual,
unexpected Stop, and at the Manner
of it e&s;pecially, murmur'd in private,
and &s;aid, that it was very &s;trange,
that the Head Boys of the School
&s;hould act thus, after all that had
been &s;een and &s;aid, of the Madne&s;s
and Folly of tho&s;e that went before
them, when it was evident, that di|viding
and Party-making among the
Captains of Forms, and the Head
Boys of the School, was the Ruine and
De&s;truction of the School; and that
the&s;e very Boys had exclaim'd again&s;t
it &s;o much, nay, when in the publick
Exerci&s;es of the School, they had of|ten
recommended the&s;e Things as the
Subject of their Orations, Declama|tions,
and Poetical Flights, (<HI>viz.) the
<PB N="32" REF="33">
Wi&s;dom of Governments in pre&s;erving
Peace among the Senators: the Danger
of Divi&s;ions in a State: the Excellen|cy
of &V;nity among the Citizens: the
Nece&s;&s;ity of a Harmony among Magi|&s;trates,
to the Safety of the Common|wealth,
and the like.</HI> They &s;aid, it
was a &s;trange Thing, to &s;ee &s;uch
Doings among Boys, who had made
&s;uch loud Pretences to the contrary.</P>
<P><HI>Again, they &s;aid,</HI> the Reputation
of the <HI>School</HI> would be entirely ru|in'd,
if not the very Con&s;titution of
it; For now it would be &s;aid, that
the&s;e Boys were no better than tho&s;e
that went before them; that it
would be evident now to all the
World, that all the pretended Zeal
they had &s;hewn again&s;t the Rudene&s;s
and unlucky Tricks of the Boys that
were in before, was only that they
might get them expell'd, and &s;o
might &s;lip into their Places; that any
<HI>Schoolma&s;ter</HI> would have been alike
to them, only that they found
this <HI>Schoolma&s;ter</HI> would &s;tand by them,
and therefore it was, that they were
&s;o eager to &s;tand by him; That
now they were gotten in to be Heads
<PB N="33" REF="34">
of Cla&s;&s;es, and Captains of the Forms,
it was plain, they meant no other than
their own private Intere&s;t and Glory;
for that now, to maintain them&s;elves,
and &s;upplant one another, they made
no Scruple to run the Hazard of ru|ining
the Ma&s;ter, and all the re&s;t of
the Scholars, and in a Word, of break|ing
the whole School.</P>
<P>Others exclaimed another Way,
and &s;aid, the De&s;ign was good, and
that all the Captain General had in
View was, to temper the Heat of the
Ca&s;h-keepers Party in the School, who
carry'd Things too high, and was &s;o
unea&s;y, that he would never leave, till,
on Pretence of Ju&s;tice and Revenge,
he had frighted all the Boys that were
not of his Party away from the
School; they &s;aid, moderate Mea&s;ures
was the only Way to pre&s;erve the In|tere&s;t
of the Schoolma&s;ter; that it
was &s;ufficient that the Heads of former
Di&s;orders had been &s;everely &s;courged,
and expelled the School; that to pur|&s;ue
to Extremity all the particular
Boys, who had the lea&s;t Concern in
former Things, but were now re|claimed,
was carrying things too far;
<PB N="34" REF="35">
that the Bu&s;ine&s;s was to govern them,
not to de&s;troy them; that the School|ma&s;ter's
Power was &s;uch, that he was
out of Danger from their evil De|&s;igns,
if they had any; and that it
was more agreeable to the Clemency
of his Di&s;po&s;ition, to forgive, than to
puni&s;h them; that to run things on
with Severity, and &s;pare no Body,
was to con$e&s;s a Weakne&s;s of Power,
and a Fear that tho&s;e few Scholars
yet culpable, might be dangerous,
which it was below the Spirit of the
Ma&s;ter to apprehend; that Examples
enough had been made; and that now
it was Time to think of gentler Me|thods,
that the Schoolma&s;ter might
gain the Affection, as well as &s;ecure
the Submi&s;&s;ion of all his Scholars.
They added, that it was never known
before, but when any new <HI>School|ma&s;ter</HI>
came to the <HI>School,</HI> he would
forgive what was pa&s;t, that he might
encourage the Boys to merit well
of him for Time to come; but that to
ravel into Trifles, was rather to &s;eek
Occa&s;ions again&s;t the Scholars, than
to do Ju&s;tice; and that therefore they
<PB N="35" REF="36">
were for bringing the Troubles of
the School to an End.</P>
<P>To this it was return'd: That this
tended to make a divided School of it
to the End of the World; that it
would pre&s;erve Faction, and cultivate
Parties for ever; that now was the
Time they had &s;o long &s;truggled for,
and which their new Ma&s;ter had pro|mi&s;ed,
&s;hould be the Effect of his
coming to the School, <HI>viz.</HI> that the
School &s;hould be purged effectually of
all wicked, debauch'd, refractory, and
rebellious Boys, and that they &s;hould
be expell'd, whoever they were; that
they abhorred the Notion of a <HI>MOT|LEY</HI>
School, to &s;et up &s;ome Friends
to the Schoolma&s;ter, and &s;ome Ene|mies,
&s;o to have the Schoolma&s;ter be
never ea&s;y, never &s;erv'd, and the
School it &s;elf never &s;afe: They &s;aid,
this was to lo&s;e all the Fruit of their
long Struggle at once, and to pull
down with their own Hands the Bul|warks
of the School which they had
built up.</P>
<P>It cannot be doubted, but as this
put all the School into a Di&s;order, &s;o
an Account of it was, from time to
<PB N="36" REF="37">
time, &s;ent over to the Schoolma&s;ter,
and to de&s;ire him to ha&s;ten over as
fa&s;t as his Bu&s;ine&s;s would permit him,
that by his Pre&s;ence and Authority,
and the Maje&s;ty of his Office, he
might quiet the School, and bring
things into &s;ome better Order.</P>
<P>The Schoolma&s;ter, &s;en&s;ible of the
Nece&s;&s;ity there was of his Pre&s;ence,
made all the Ha&s;te he could to di&s;|patch
his Affairs; but having things
of great Con&s;equence on his Hands,
they took him up more Time than he,
or the Scholars, either expected, be|fore
he could come.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, the School was
a meer <HI>Bedlam,</HI> Books and Bu&s;ine&s;s
&s;eem'd all laid a&s;ide, every mean Scho|lar,
that had &s;carce entred into the
Verges of Philo&s;ophy, was over Head
and Ears in Politicks, and attach'd to
his Party. The Forms were all up in
Arms again&s;t one another, as the Heads
or Captains guided them, they fell into
the warme&s;t Di&s;putes imaginable;
nay, &s;ometimes they were &s;o hot, that
they were ready to throw their Books
at one anothers Heads.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="38">
In a Word; this Contention was
come to that Height, that, had it not
been that they had a Ma&s;ter, who&s;e
Authority and Per&s;on maintained an
Awe in their Minds, and who, they
knew, when he did come, would be
in a Condition to call them all to an
Account, and would not be afraid to
do it; I &s;ay, had it not been for this,
it was the Opinion of wi&s;e Men at
that Time, that they would have torn
one another to Pieces, and &s;et the
whole School on Fire.</P>
<P>In the very Cri&s;is of this Fewd,
and ju&s;t as they were all going mad,
being as it may be &s;aid, ju&s;t got out
of the Government of them&s;elves,
comes the Schoolma&s;ter on Shore, and
making no Stay, he went directly to
the School: He found by the Noi&s;e,
there was no Room for Words, Per|&s;wa&s;ions,
Expo&s;tulations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> where|fore
with an awful Frown upon his
Brow, and holding up his Rod in his
Hand, he enters the <HI>School,</HI> and being
ju&s;t within the Door, looked &s;ternly
round him, not &s;peaking a Word.</P>

The Boys no &s;ooner &s;aw the Ma&s;ter
and the Rod, but they all &s;at down
as quiet and as &s;till, as if nothing had
happened at all; not a Word was
&s;poken, not the lea&s;t Noi&s;e heard, all
was perfectly calm and quiet in a Mo|ment;
the Ma&s;ter went peaceably up to
his Chair of In&s;truction, and laid down
his Rod; the <HI>Scholars</HI> fell very loving|ly
to their Books, and have been very
good Boys ever &s;ince.</P>
