<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_AS this Way of Writing in
Ca&s;es not much unlike this,
has been approv'd of, and
has met with great Succe&s;s
in other Hands. It has been an En|couragement
to this &V;ndertaking.</P>
<P>Hi&s;torical Dialogues, it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;'d,
have a very taking Elegancy in
them, and the Story being handed for|ward
in &s;hort Periods, and quick Re|turns,
makes the retaining it in the
Mind the ea&s;ier, and the Impre&s;&s;ion the
more la&s;ting, as well as delightful.</P>
<P><PB REF="3">
The Story repre&s;ented here is capable
of &s;uch, and &s;o many Applications to the
Ca&s;es of young People, who&s;e Settlement
is always in View, that there will never
be a Time when the in&s;truction will be
u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>If any Body &s;hould object, that too
much is put here upon the Womans's Part,
and that a Lady cannot be &s;uppos'd in
the mid&s;t of her Lover's Adddre&s;&s;es, to
take upon her, to demand &s;uch an Ac|count
of him&s;elf as is here &s;ugge&s;ted;
that few Men will &s;toop to &s;uch an Exa|mination;
and few Women venture the
Lo&s;s of their Lovers upon &s;uch a Subject.
Let &s;uch con&s;ider how &s;mall the Satis|faction
here propos'd on the Ladies Part
is, and that no Gentleman can think
hard a Woman &s;hould be &s;atisfy'd, whe|ther
he is a Chri&s;tian or a Heathen; a
Man of Religion or an Athei&s;t, and
indeed, no Man of any tolerable Share of
Sen&s;e, will addre&s;s him&s;elf to a Lady
<PB REF="4">
for Marriage, but he will take care to
anticipate her Enquiries of that Kind,
by flowing &s;ome Concern, for knowing
what &s;he is her&s;elf.</P>
<P>The univer&s;al Neglect of this Trifle
both in Men and Women, is what this
Book is de&s;ign'd to correct, and there
needs no greater Satyr upon that Part,
than the Succe&s;s of the &s;everal Ca&s;es
here related; The happy Life of the
younge&s;t Si&s;ter who came into the Mea|&s;ures
propo&s;ed; and the mi&s;erable Con|dition
of the &s;econd Si&s;ter, who ra&s;hly
threw her&s;elf into the Arms of a Man
of differing Principles from her own, tho
ble&s;t with all the good Humour in the
World.</P>
<P>In the&s;e Accounts, the very great
Con&s;equence of being equally yok'd, is il|lu&s;trated;
and it appears here how e&s;|&s;entail
a Share of Religion, and Har|mony
of Principles in Religion, is to
the Felicity of Life.</P>
<P><PB REF="5">
To tho&s;e who do not ca&s;t off all con|cern
for them&s;elves; who do not make
marrying be a mere Leap in the Dark,
and as the fir&s;t Lady expre&s;&s;es it, a
ru&s;hing like a Hor&s;e into the Battle,
the&s;e things will be of &s;ome Moment.
As to tho&s;e that are void of Care of the&s;e
Matters, they mu&s;t go on, and pay for
their Experience, let them take heed,
and buy it as cheap as they can.</P>
<P>If the Women &s;eem to be favoured
in this Story, and have the better Part
of the Staff put into their Hands, it
is because really the Hazard is chiefly on
their Side, and they are generally the
greate&s;t Sufferers in the Succe&s;s; but
if it were otherwi&s;e, yet, if they are
treated with more than ordinary Regard,
the Author hopes they will not lay that
Sin to his Charge.</P>
<P>The Appendix to this Work, &s;peaks
for it &s;elf: Irreligious Servants in &s;ome
Re&s;pects, are the Plague of Families,
<PB REF="6">
and keep our Hou&s;es always in Di&s;order,
'Tis a wonderful Thing to reflect on,
that &s;o &s;candalous an Evil, &s;o ea&s;y to
be rectify'd &s;hould have gone on to &s;uch
a Degree as it has in the World; and
that Ma&s;ters and Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of Fami|lies,
have not long, ago for their own
Ea&s;e, and for the Satisfaction of one
another, come to a General Law, for
the managing, the puni&s;hing, and above
all, for the recommending of Servants;
which if they &s;hould do, they would ea&s;i|ly,
I &s;ay, bring them to know them|&s;elves,
and do their Duty; neither of
which is the Ca&s;e among Servants at
this Time.</P>
<P>But 'tis all our own Faults; we re|commend
Sluts, and Thieves, and
Drones, and &s;aucy in&s;olent Fellows,
and Wenches: I &s;ay, we recommend
them one to another, without any Con|cern
for our Neighbour's Safety or
Peace; in a Word, to pay the Debt of
<PB REF="7">
Charity for tho&s;e Creatures, which have
abus'd us, we forget the Debt of Ju&s;tice
to one another, and betray the Confidence
which one Hou&s;e-keeper and Neighbour
owes to another, in one of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;en|tial
Articles of their Families Quiet.</P>
<P>This is all expos'd here, and tho' this
Part is very &s;hort; being but an Ac|cident
to the other Di&s;cour&s;es; yet, I
pre&s;ume my &s;elf it will be as accepta|ble,
and in its Kind, as u&s;eful as any
of the Re&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<P>_THERE liv'd in a Village near <HI>Lon|don,</HI>
an ancient grave Gentleman
of a good E&s;tate, which he had
gain'd by Trade, having been bred
a Merchant, tho' of a very good
Family too; he had been a Man
in great Bu&s;ine&s;s, but his Circum|&s;tances
being ea&s;y, and his Love of a retir'd Life
increasing, with his Years, he had left off his Bu|&s;ine&s;s,
and taken a Hou&s;e a Mile or two out of
Town; he was a Widower at the Time of this
Affair, his Wife having been dead &s;ome years
before.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="9">
He had five or &s;ix Children, and all grown up,
but none &s;ettled in the World, tho' he had an
E&s;tate &s;ufficient to give them very plentiful For|tunes.
His three Daughters were very agreeable
Women, and, which was &s;till better, were very
&s;ober, mode&s;t, &s;en&s;ible and religious young Ladies,
two 'of them e&s;pecially; and as the Character of
their Father, and the Fortune he was able to give
them, recommended them very well to the World;
&s;o they had &s;everal Gentlemen that made honour|able
and hand&s;ome Propo&s;als to their Father for
their Marriage.</P>
<P>I &s;hall mo&s;t carefully avoid giving any room
here &s;o much as to gue&s;s what Opinion in Reli|gion
they were bred up in, or whether the old
Gentleman was a Churchman or a Di&s;&s;enter; and
the &s;ame Caution I &s;hall u&s;e with all the re&s;t of
the Per&s;ons whom I &s;hall bring upon the Stage in
the Cour&s;e of this Story: My Rea&s;on for which
every Body will under&s;tand by the Nature of the
Relation, and of the Times we live in.</P>
<P>The Father of the&s;e Ladies had been a Man al|ways,
till now, hurried in the World; being
crowded with a va&s;t Bu&s;ine&s;s, taken up with get|ting
Money, and with growing rich; &s;o that he
neither had much Concern for, or indeed took
any Care of the Education or In&s;truction of his
Children, but left them wholly to the Conduct of
their Mother. Nor was it any great Lo&s;s to the
Children, e&s;pecially to the Daughters, their Mo|ther
being a mo&s;t pious, religious and virtuous
Lady, who was not only extraordinarily qualified
to in&s;truct her Children, but gave up her whole
Time to it from their Childhood.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="10">
A little before her Death, calling to her Daugh|ters,
&s;he told them among other Things, That as
to Marriage &s;he had but two Injunctions to lay
upon them, which, as &s;he was not likely to live
to &s;ee them &s;ettled, file would de&s;ire them to lay
down as Maxims in the Choice of their Husbands;
and which &s;he would, as upon her Death-bed, if
her Words had any extraordinary Influence upon
them, oblige them to ob&s;erve &s;trictly, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>1. Never to marry any Man, what ever the For|tune
might be, that did not at lea&s;t profe&s;s to be a <HI>Re|ligious
Man.</HI></P>
<P>2. Never to marry any Man, how religious &s;oever he
may <HI>&s;eem to be,</HI> if he was not of the &s;ame Principles
and Opinion in Religion as them&s;elves.</P>
<P>And as this was but a little before her Death, &s;o
the Daughters were more than ordinarily touch'd
with the Sen&s;e of it, and re&s;olv'd to pur&s;ue it ex|actly.
How they did pur&s;ue it, and the Conf&s;e|quences
of it will be &s;een in the following Dia|logues.</P>
<P>It followed &s;ome time after, that a Gentleman
of a very good E&s;tate courted the younge&s;t of
the&s;e Daughters; and making Very hand&s;ome Pro|po&s;als
to her Father, (<HI>for he offer'd to &s;ettle</HI> 600 l. per
Annum <HI>upon her</HI>) the Father was exceedingly
plea&s;ed with the Match; he being a Gentleman
thoroughly well bred; an agreeable Per&s;on, and
in a Word, nothing appearing to give the lea&s;t
Rea&s;on, why he &s;hould not be as acceptable to the
Lady as he was to the Father.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="11">
As he came thus recommended to the Father,
there appeared nothing di&s;agreeable in it to the
young Lady; nor had &s;he at his fir&s;t Appearance
the lea&s;t Exception to make again&s;t the Gentle|man
as to his Per&s;on; Indeed, as to his E&s;tate,
<HI>tho' her Fortune was very hand&s;ome,</HI> yet his was &s;o far
beyond it, that there was no Compari&s;on in the
Ca&s;e; and be&s;ides all this, &s;he had this engaging
Circum&s;tance in the Propo&s;al, <HI>viz.</HI> That &s;he be|ing
the younge&s;t of the three Daughters, the
Gentleman had pa&s;s'd over her two elde&s;t Si&s;ters,
and had &s;ingled her put by his more particular
Fancy; giving her that undeniable Mark of his
Affection, <HI>viz.</HI> That &s;he would be the Wife of his
Choice, and con&s;equently that &s;he would have an
uncommon Security of the Sincerity of his Love
to her.</P>
<P>The Father oppos'd his Propo&s;al a little at fir&s;t,
as a Slight offer'd to his elde&s;t Daughters; but the
Gentleman told him, That he hop'd, if he accept|ed
his De&s;ign of corning into his Family, he would
give him leave to take the Per&s;on his Judgment
had made choice of, and that he thought he might
be happy with: That it would be a very hard
Circum&s;tance to him, and what he could not think
of with Patience, to marry one of his Daughters,
and be in love with another: That he was very
far from offering any Slight to the elde&s;t, letting
them know, that happening to &s;ee the younge&s;t
fir&s;t, he found &s;uch Suitablene&s;s, and &s;omething
&s;o agreeable in her to him, that he re&s;olv'd to look
no farther: That perhaps, if he had &s;een the elde&s;t
or the &s;econd Daughter fir&s;t, it might have been
the &s;ame thing; but that as he could not an&s;wer for
the Byafs of his Fancy, &s;o neither could he an&s;wer
it to his own Conduct, not to choo&s;e her, that was
<PB N="5" REF="12">
from the fir&s;t Moment he &s;aw her, the only Wo|man
in the World, that he ever thought could
make him happy.</P>
<P>Her Father could make no Return to an An&s;wer
that had &s;o much Weight in it, and which ap|peared
to be &s;o &s;incere; and therefore not acquaint|ing
his elde&s;t Daughters with the De&s;ign he had
had to propo&s;e her to him, he took occa&s;ion to talk
to them all together one Morning, as they were
drinking Chocolate; and begins merrily with them
thus:</P>

with his Daughter, and to tell her that, this was
the Gentleman that he had told her of, that in|tended
to court her, and that he expected, &s;he
<PB N="16" REF="23">
would <HI>think of the thing,</HI> and receive him as her
own Inclinations and his Merit &s;hould direct.</P>
<P>The Gentleman did not di&s;cour&s;e much with
her by her&s;elf that time, having no De&s;ign to be|gin
clo&s;ely at the fir&s;t View; however, he had the
Opportunity of walking two or three Turns with
her in a green Walk in the Garden, and when he
took his Leave, told her he re&s;olv'd to wait on her
again; to which &s;he made him no An&s;wer for that
time.</P>
<P>The next Evening he came again, and after that
for &s;everal Evenings together, when having made
her acquainted with his De&s;ign, and laid clo&s;e
Siege to her for &s;ome time, &s;he found nothing to
object again&s;t him; for he was indeed a mo&s;t agree|able
Per&s;on, and her Father pre&s;&s;ing her to it on
the other Hand, and letting her know, what ho|nourable
Propo&s;als he had made her&punc; and how he
had &s;ingled her out from all her Si&s;ters as the Ob|ject
of his Choice, &s;he began in&s;en&s;ibly to find
her Affections very &s;trongly bya&s;s'd in his Favour.</P>
<P>All this while &s;he could make no Di&s;covery of
any thing about Religion in him, nor &s;o much as
whether he was well inclin'd, or perfetctly de&s;ti|tute.
The Re&s;pect he &s;hew'd her, and the Di|&s;tance
&s;he kept him at, permitted him not to u&s;e
any loo&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions, that might give her any
Light into his Principles; and as he afterwards
confe&s;s'd, he found her &s;o nice in things of that
Kind, that the lea&s;t di&s;located Word would have
given her an Offence; and therefore he kept up|on
his Guard a great while, till at length, when
they became more intimate, he abated his u&s;ual
Caution.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="24">
By this Time, as &s;he confe&s;s'd to her Si&s;ter, &s;he

him Rea&s;on to fee, that &s;he de&s;ign'd to have him&punc;
But &s;he was under a great Concern, how to know
what he was as to Religion; and terribly afraid,

The next Evening the two Si&s;ters and this young
Gentleman walking in the Garden, as was u&s;ual
after Supper, and talking of &s;everal indifferent
Things, a Servant brings the elde&s;t Si&s;ter a Letter,
which made &s;ome little Stop in their Walk. She
open'd it, and read it; and he finding her Colour
change a little in the reading, &s;tept up to her;
&s;ays he, <HI>What's the matter, Si&s;ter?</HI> (for he always
call'd her Si&s;ter) <HI>You have no bad News, I hope?
Truly,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>one way 'tis no bad News, and another
way 'tis.</HI> And turning to her Si&s;ter, &s;he &s;ays, <HI>Sir</HI>
James <HI>is dead.</HI> He was a little concern'd to hear
&s;ome of the Family was dead, le&s;t it &s;hould grieve
his Mi&s;tre&s;s. But &s;he, without any appearance of
Trouble return'd, <HI>Well, &s;ince 'tis the Di&s;po&s;al of Pro|vidence,
I am not griev'd; For my Aunt is delivered
from one of the wor&s;t good Husbands, that ever a &s;ober
Woman had.</HI> He took hold of that Word pre&s;ently,
and &s;till directing his Speech to her Si&s;ter, &s;aid,
<HI>Wor&s;t good Husband! What My&s;tery is that?</HI> Why tru|ly,
&s;ays the Si&s;ter, <HI>the thing's too true:</HI> Sir <HI>James</HI>
was a very good Husband in his Humour, and in
&s;everal other Things; but my <HI>Lady</HI> had a dreadful
Life with him. <HI>Why,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>that may be very true;
a Man may be a very good Husband in one things, and be
very unkind in another, it's owing much to the Di&s;agree|ment
of Tempers.</HI> The young Lady's Si&s;ter was di&s;|appointed
in his An&s;wer; for &s;he expected he would
have inquired into the Particulars, but he put it
off, as a Thing, that did not concern him much; at
which the younger Si&s;ter look'd at her and &s;mil'd,
which was as much as to tell her, that &s;he had
found now, that what &s;he had told her was true;
namely, that &s;he would not &s;ee it ea&s;y to break in
upon him. She took the Hint, and re&s;olved &s;he
would try the be&s;t of her Skill, and &s;he found it
<PB N="21" REF="28">
&s;oon an&s;wer'd her End: &s;o &s;he returned to him
pretty &s;martly, <HI>No, no, Sir,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>It was not at
all from Di&s;agreement of Tempers in this Ca&s;e,</HI> it was
wor&s;e a great deal, <HI>it was Di&s;agreement of Principles;
for the Gentleman was of a very good Temper, I a&s;&s;ure you:
Then if he had a good Wife,</HI> returns he, <HI>he &s;hould
have made it his fir&s;t Principle to have been obliging and
good temper'd to his Wife.</HI> Alas! &s;ays the Lady, <HI>he
had no Religion, and &s;he is the mo&s;t pious religious Lady
in the World.</HI> It may be then, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> &s;he had
enough for her and her Husband too. <HI>Her being
religious,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>made his Want of it an in&s;ufferable
Burden to her:</HI> Then &s;he was co blame, &s;ayshe,
for what need &s;he have been unea&s;y at that? <HI>Not
unea&s;y!</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>How is it po&s;&s;ible a religious Woman
can live comfortably with an irreligious prophane Husband!
O very well,</HI> &s;ays he again; <HI>What &s;ignifies it to a Wo|man,
whether her Husband have any Religion or no?</HI>
I have better Thoughts of you, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> than to
believe you &s;peak as you think, or that you would
be under&s;tood &s;o.</P>
<P>Her Si&s;ter had li&s;tened very attentively to all
this, and was &s;en&s;ibly affected with it, but had &s;aid
nothing till now, when &s;he turned upon her Si&s;ter.
<HI>Why Si&s;ter,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>&s;hould you think &s;o? I hope Mr.</HI>
&mdash;<HI>&s;ays nothing but what he is very &s;incere in. Do
you think he has not his Religion to choo&s;e as well as other
young Gentlemen?</HI> Madam, &s;ays he, <HI>How &s;hould I
choo&s;e my Religion, that have not cho&s;en me a Wife?</HI> Then
you are for chu&s;ing you a Wife fir&s;t, <HI>&s;ays his Mi&s;tre&s;s,</HI>

&s;ays he, <HI>Don't all the Gentlemen in</HI> England <HI>do &s;o too?</HI>

She was now too well &s;atisfied of what &s;he fear'd

Father the News of the Death of his Brother in
Law, &s;he left her Si&s;ter to walk with her Lover,

God, and profe&s;s to fear and &s;erve him; and

<P>She was with him after that, &s;ome Hours in the

proper for the Family, and decent to their Father,
that they &s;hould make &s;ome little Alteration in
their Conduct, and de&s;ir'd he would not take it ill,
that &s;he retired from him &s;ooner than &s;he us'd to
do. This he could not object again&s;t, and accor|dingly
he took his leave, believing that her Unea|&s;ine&s;s
was nothing, but the Bu&s;ine&s;s of her Aunt's
being a Widow, which, tho', as &s;he &s;aid, me was
not much concern'd for, yet &s;everal things about
it, might take up her Thoughts, &s;o as to make her
not &s;o perfectly ea&s;y, or &s;o good Company as &s;he
was before.</P>
<P>But he was quite out in his Gue&s;s; for her Un|ea&s;ine&s;s

yet without being rude and uncivil to him, and
without di&s;obliging her Father; for &s;he was firmly

<P>When &s;he had thus taken her Leave of him, &s;he
went up into her Chamber, &s;ending her Maid to

to Supper, for &s;he was indi&s;po&s;ed.</P>

<P>This was a Night of Pa&s;&s;ion, and little was done
all the Evening by the Father but to make Work
for Repentance. He was &s;o provoked at his

he would turn her out of doors; that &s;he &s;hould go

whatever he left to the re&s;t of his Children, it
&s;hould be upon Condition, that they &s;hould never
relieve her, nor own her, nor call her Si&s;ter, and
that if they did, what they had &s;hould go to his

<P>He was &s;o di&s;turbed, that he got but little Sleep
all Night, and in the Morning he was obliged to
go out of Town early to his Si&s;ter's, about 40 Miles
off, who&s;e Husband was ju&s;t dead; &s;o that he did
not &s;ee his younge&s;t Daughter any more, before he
went; but ju&s;t as he was &s;tepping into his Chariot,
he call'd his elde&s;t Daughter to him, <HI>What,</HI> &s;ays he,
Child, is to be done in this Affair while I am gone?
She won't be &s;o rude to turn him off, while I am

<P>In this Temper the Father went away: The

it; however, upon talking farther with her
Si&s;ter the &s;ame Morning, and finding her inflexible,

<P>I a&s;&s;ure you, as I told you, he is no

like him the better for it.</P>

<SPEAKER>3d. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, after we had been together about
half an Hour, he &s;eemed to recollect him&s;elf, and
<HI>told me,</HI> he ask'd me Pardon, that he had not con|dol'd
with me for the Lo&s;s of my Uncle Sir <HI>James</HI>
&mdash;; <HI>I told him,</HI> he need not, for the Lo&s;s was
not &s;o great. <HI>He reply'd,</HI> He thought I appear'd
very much concerned at it la&s;t Night, which made
him withdraw &s;ooner than he intended. <HI>I told him,</HI>
I was thoughtful indeed, but not &s;o much about
that; for tho' I believed my Aunt was very &s;orry
for his Death, yet I thought &s;he had no great Rea|&s;on;
for I was &s;ure &s;he lived a very uncomfortable
Life with him. <HI>He wanted then very much to know,</HI>
what I was &s;o thoughtful about, if I was not
troubled at the Lo&s;s of my Uncle; I declin'd tel|ling
him, but did it in a way, that I intended &s;hould
prompt his Curio&s;ity; <HI>for I de&s;ired nothing more than
to have a fair Opportunity to tell him very plainly what
troubled me,</HI> and he &s;oon gave it me. <HI>He told me,</HI>
<PB N="40" REF="47">
He took him&s;elf to be &s;o much intere&s;ted in me
<HI>now,</HI> as to be concerned in all my Griefs; and he
claimed to know, if any thing afflicted me, that he
might bear his Share in it; and added &s;omething &s;o
hand&s;ome and &s;o obliging on that Head, that I mu&s;t
acknowledge, it &s;hook my Re&s;olution very much,
and I had almo&s;t given over my De&s;ign; but I re|covered
my &s;elf again in a Moment or two.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed you are a re&s;olute Girl: I think
what you repeat of him was very engaging.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> it was natural for People to
make &s;udden Tran&s;itions from other People's Ca&s;e
to their own, and that indeed that was the Occa&s;i|on
that made me &s;o unea&s;y: I knew my Aunt was
a Lady of great Piety and Vertue, that every one
knew to be exceedingly religious and &s;erious;
that on the other hand, Sir <HI>James</HI> was a mad, fro|lick&s;ome,
merry Fellow; that neither under&s;tood
any Religion, or troubled him&s;elf about it, but
would play a thou&s;and mad Tricks with her, be|cau&s;e
of her &s;trict Ob&s;ervation of religious Things;
and that this gave her a con&s;tant Unea&s;ne&s;s: He
&s;mil'd, and &s;aid, he hop'd I was not afraid of him
on that Score; for, <HI>Madam; &s;ays</HI> he, <HI>tho' I pretend
to no Religion my &s;elf, I cannot but re&s;pect them that do.</HI>
This was the fir&s;t, and I think a con&s;iderable Con|firmation
of what we had before; <HI>was it not, Si&s;ter?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am &s;orry to hear it; but I'll tell you
however, there was one thing, that I ob&s;erve to be
a good Foundation for Religion, <HI>viz.</HI> that he re|&s;pected
them that were religious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Si&s;ter; but we did not end here:
I told him, I was very &s;orry to hear him &s;ay, <HI>he had
no Religion him&s;elf;</HI> becau&s;e, as perhaps I had not a
great deal, to marry a Man that had none, would
endanger my lo&s;ing what I had, and I &s;hould ra|ther
<PB N="41" REF="48">
have a Husband to help me on towards Hea|ven,
than to pull me back.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>What could he &s;ay to that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>He told me, he did not doubt but I
would go to Heaven without his Help; he &s;aid
je&s;tingly, it was a Road he had never travelled; but
I might be a&s;&s;ured, he would not willingly pull me
back, if he did not help me on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, there was &s;omething very ho|ne&s;t
in that too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true, Si&s;ter; but negative Reli|gion
is a poor Stock to begin on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it's better than a De&s;pi&s;er of Re|ligion:
you ought to have acknowledged, what
good you found.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>My De&s;igns lay another Way; I aim'd
at a fuller Di&s;covery, and I &s;oon had it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, go on then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I told him, what Tricks my Uncle u&s;ed
to &s;erve my Aunt; how he got a Book of Devo|tions
out of her Clo&s;et once, and got a long print|ed
Story about ducking a Scold pa&s;ted into it; and
another time got the Ballad of <HI>Chevy Cha&s;e</HI> bound
into her P&s;alm-Book; how when he knew &s;he was
in her Clo&s;et at her Devotion, he would bring his
Hunt&s;man to feed the Hounds ju&s;t under her Win|dow;
and how one Time he made a Fellow cry
Fire, <HI>and the like;</HI> as you know, Si&s;ter, he play'd
many &s;uch Pranks and would do any thing to put
her Thoughts into Di&s;order. <HI>He told me,</HI> tho' he
was but a young Fellow, and had not troubled his
Thoughts much about Religion, (<HI>there was another
Stab to my Affections, Si&s;ter,</HI>) yet he &s;aid he could not
bear to make a Je&s;t of it neither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but that was another word in his
Favour too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="42" REF="49">
<SPEAKER>3d. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I reply'd,</HI> I was very &s;orry to hear him
own, that <HI>he had not troubled his Thoughts about Reli|gion,</HI>
and ask'd him upon what Foundation he could
think of &s;etting up a Family, if that was his Ca&s;e?
He told me, he kept a Chaplain, and je&s;ting told
me, he was devout enough for all the re&s;t of the
Hou&s;e. I grew chagrin and dull; I told him, that
the&s;e Things had fill'd me with very &s;ad Thoughts
about marrying, and it look'd very di&s;mal to me;
but all I could &s;ay, could not bring him to believe
I was in earne&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe he is really very good hu|mour'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Ay, Si&s;ter,</HI> that's true; but I look for
&s;omething farther in a Husband, or I am re&s;olved
I'll have no Husband at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but pray go on with your Story;
what An&s;wer did he make.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>He laugh'd at me, and told me, he be|lieved
marrying would make him mighty religious;
that he would choo&s;e a Wife fir&s;t, and then choo&s;e
his Religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Man was mad &s;ure to open him|&s;elf
&s;o fully.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I appeared then really di&s;turb'd; and
whether he perceived it or no, I am &s;ure the Tears
&s;tood in my Eyes; however I &s;truggled with my
Di&s;order, and told him I was very &s;orry then, that
it was his Misfortune to begin with one, that could
not be content to marry upon tho&s;e Terms; and
hoped, when he was fully &s;atisfied of the Rea&s;on
of &s;uch a Re&s;olution in me, he would not take it
ill, that <HI>I would &s;tay for him,</HI> till he had re&s;olved
more &s;eriou&s;ly upon a Thing of &s;o much more Im|portance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was very cunningly an&s;wer'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="43" REF="50">
<SPEAKER>3d. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then he began to think I was in earne&s;t,
and told me, he hop'd I would not <HI>talk &s;o,</HI> becau&s;e
it might be longer than he de&s;ired to be without
me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was &s;till making the Ca&s;e wor&s;e;

Religion, nor intended to have any.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not fail to take it &s;o, and <HI>told him,</HI>
the longer he was without me, it might be the
better for him; but the longer he was without Re|ligion,
I was &s;ure would be the wor&s;e for him; <HI>and
that I wonder'd,</HI> how a Man of his Sen&s;e could talk
&s;o. <HI>He reply'd,</HI> he had rather talk of any thing
el&s;e; for he found this Di&s;cour&s;e did not plea&s;e
me. <HI>I told him,</HI> he mi&s;took me very much; for tho'
I confe&s;s'd it did not plea&s;e me to find him to be
what I hoped he was not, that is, a Per&s;on who
pretended to no Religion; yet it plea&s;ed me very
well, that he had been &s;o ju&s;t to him&s;elf, as to let
me know it, before any Engagements had pa&s;s'd be|tween
us.</P>

<SPEAKER>1st. Sist.</SPEAKER>

<P>You know, 'tis all new to me; but

that as his Engagements were from him&s;elf
&s;o they were be&s;t known to him&s;elf; but that he
knew very well, I was under none to him. He
&s;mil'd then, <HI>and &s;aid,</HI> he hop'd I was; I an&s;wer'd, I
had not profe&s;s'd to be engag'd; I told him, I
would not deny, that I had Re&s;pect enough for him
to have gone farther, had not &s;uch Difficulties ap|peared
as I could never get over, and had he been
the Per&s;on he was repre&s;ented; <HI>but that,</HI> as it was
I had too much Re&s;pect for my &s;elf to ruin my &s;elf

<P>Would he not take that for being in

<P>Yes, he &s;hewed me then, that he too$$$
me to be in earne&s;t, and &s;hewed me, that he was; in
earne&s;t too; for he appeared warm and a little
angry; he told me, he was very &s;orry to be charged
with deceiving me; and ask'd, if ever he had &s;aid
any thing of him&s;elf, which was not true? For
<HI>Madam,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>if I am not the Per&s;on I appeared to
be, I mu&s;t have deceived you in &s;omething; pray what
&s;ort of a Per&s;on did you take me for?</HI> I reply'd <HI>as warn
as he,</HI> that I wonder'd he &s;hould mi&s;take me &s;o
much, that I thought he did not do me Ju&s;tice
that I had &s;aid indeed he was not the Per&s;on he
<HI>had been</HI> repre&s;ented, but never &s;aid, that <HI>he had re|pre&s;ented</HI>
him&s;elf one way or other. Then <HI>he begg'd my
Pardon again,</HI> and told me, he had taken me wrong
that whatever came of it, he would never deceive
me; I &s;hould know the wor&s;t of him, whether I
would have him or no. <HI>Indeed Sir,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>I am per|&s;uaded

No, Sir,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>I very much approve your Hone&s;ty,

say, that it was not in his Power to have deceived
me; but I hope he had acted a Part much more
like a Gentleman. <HI>He reply'd,</HI> that it was hard then,

<SPEAKER>3d. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I told him I thought the be&s;t Return
was to treat him with the &s;ame Sincerity, and that
was the Rea&s;on of the Freedom I took; that as he
told me plainly what he was, I mu&s;t tell him plain|ly,
I could not think of engaging with him any
farther, till he had thought a little of tho&s;e things,
which alone could make it rea&s;onable for him to
think of marrying. He would fain have turned it
off to a Je&s;t, he laugh'd at me, he banter'd me,
he ask'd me how long I would <HI>&s;tay for him?</HI> I told
him I was in no ha&s;te, <HI>He ask'd me</HI> how long I
thought I might &s;tay, before I got a Saint to my
Mind, as the World went now? <HI>I told him,</HI> I was
but an ill Judge of Saints, and might be cheated
as <HI>wi&s;er than I had been;</HI> but that, <HI>as I &s;aid before,</HI> I
would not fall into the Pit with my Eyes open.
<HI>He told me abruptly,</HI> he wi&s;h'd <HI>I had never &s;een him.</HI>
At that Word, I confe&s;s, I was a little alarm'd; how|ever
I made <HI>no An&s;wer,</HI> but look'd full in his Face;
I &s;aw he was concern'd, and, as I thought, in a

he repeated the Words thus, <HI>I wi&s;h with all my

He added, he wi&s;h'd <HI>he had known my Mind &s;ooner.</HI>

would not have this Man, or that Man, who ne|ver

not di&s;agreeable, and who&s;e E&s;tate and Propo&s;als
were very much better than I had Rea&s;on to expect;
yet that upon this one &s;ingle Account, I &s;&s;ured
him, I neither could nor would ever di&s;cour&s;e more

take it ill, that I was forced to be &s;o plain with him,

for &s;everal Rea&s;ons: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Becau&s;e he might find
&s;o many young Ladies abroad, who would not
trouble their Heads to make the Objection I had
done, and that there was no Occa&s;ion for him to
turn religious for a Wife. <HI>Secondly,</HI> becau&s;e there
was no Appearance of his returning upon tho&s;e
Terms. <HI>He &s;aid,</HI> that was more than I knew. <HI>But</HI>
pray Madam, &s;aid he, <HI>why do you lay &s;uch a mighty
Stre&s;s upon this Particular; Religion is an entire Article
by it &s;elf; my being religious or not religious need
not ob&s;truct our Affection to one another; I am no Enemy
to Religion.</HI> I an&s;wered, that it was indeed an ac|ceptable
Thing, as Times went now, not to find
Gentlemen De&s;pi&s;ers and Haters of Religion, and
of all that favour'd it; but that I was a&s;&s;ured, where
there was not a Profe&s;&s;ion of Religion, and where
God was not acknowledged, there could be no
Ble&s;&s;ing expected; and that I &s;hould think I had
renounced God, and declared War again&s;t Hea|ven,
if I &s;hould marry a Man, that openly acknow|ledged
he had no Religion. He told me, he was
&s;orry to &s;ee me run things to &s;uch an Extremity,
that he did not think I had been in earne&s;t, when
he in je&s;t &s;aid, he had not thought of Religion; that
he would not urge me in a Thing, which I laid &s;o
much Stre&s;s upon, but would wait on me again,
and hop'd to find me in another Mind, and to let
me know he was not quite &s;o bad, as I thought him
to be. And thus we broke up.</P>

<P>We mu&s;t now leave the two Si&s;ters a while, and
follow the young Gentleman a little, for his Story
does not end &s;o; he went away very much con|cern'd,
<HI>as above,</HI> and particularly it touch'd him
very &s;en&s;ibly, that he &s;hould be taken for &s;uch a
Creature, that a &s;ober, vertuous Lady, (for &s;uch he
was &s;ure his Mi&s;tre&s;s was) &s;hould refu&s;e him meer$y
on account of his wicked Character; and that tho'
&s;he acknowledged &s;he had a Re&s;pect for him, &s;he
was obliged to &s;hun him, purely becau&s;e &s;he was
afraid of him, as a Hater of Religion, and there|fore
dangerous to live with: It had run often in his
Mind, that &s;he had &s;aid, &s;he could expect no Ble&s;|&s;ing
with him; and that if &s;he married him, &s;he
&s;hould think &s;he had <HI>renounced God, and declared War
again&s;t Heaven;</HI> &s;o that <HI>to be &s;ure I am a dreadful Fel|low,</HI>
&s;ays he, <HI>that &s;he dares not take me, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould
appear to be a Confederate with one of God's Enemies.</HI></P>
<P>It then occurr'd to him, that it really was no
otherwi&s;e in Fact; that &s;he was in the right in it
all; that he had in truth no Religion, or Sen&s;e of
<PB N="50" REF="57">
God, upon his Mind, nor had ever entertained
any Notions of Religion in his Thoughts, <HI>and had
told her &s;o him&s;elf;</HI> and that therefore the young
Lady was in the right of it, and if &s;he had any
Fund of Religion her&s;elf, had a great deal of
Rea&s;on to refu&s;e him; that every &s;ober Woman
ought to refu&s;e him on the &s;ame Account; and
that &s;he, that did not, was not fit to make him a
Wife, or at lea&s;t &s;uch a Wife as he could expect any
Happine&s;s from; that this young Lady had made
a true Judgment, and it was his Bu&s;ine&s;s, not to
think of per&s;uading her to alter her Mind, <HI>which
in &s;hort mu&s;t le&s;&s;en his Opinion of her,</HI> but to con&s;ider
what State and Condition he was in, and what
was his fir&s;t Bu&s;ine&s;s to do, to deliver him&s;elf out
of it, before he went to her any more.</P>
<P>He grew unea&s;ie upon this Subject for &s;ome time,
and being perfectly ignorant of every thing call'd
<HI>Duty,</HI> having had an Education wholly void of In|&s;truction,
that Unea&s;ine&s;s increa&s;ed; and not know|ing
which way to ca&s;t his Thoughts for immediate
Direction, he grew very melancholy and dejected:
He lov'd this young Woman to an Extreme, and
that Affection was infinitely increas'd by her Con|duct
in this Affairs and by the extraordinary Man|ner
of her refu&s;ing him, But the Reproaches of
his Heart, as being &s;uch a Mon&s;ter, that a Woman,
that even own'd &s;he lov'd him, dur&s;t not join her|&s;elf
to him, doubled upon him, as his Affections
for her increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>He could not think of coming to her again; for
he confe&s;s'd the Rea&s;ons, which &s;he gave for her
not daring to take him, were &s;o ju&s;t, and &s;he had
argued them &s;o well, that if &s;he &s;hould abate any
thing of them, he &s;hould not have &s;o much E&s;teem
for her as he had before; and yet he &s;aw, that if
&s;he did not, he could never expect to have her;
<PB N="51" REF="58">
and yet al&s;o he could not bear the Thoughts of
not having her, <HI>for all that.</HI></P>
<P>He liv'd in this unea&s;y Condition &s;ome Months;
his Friends perceiving him to be very melancholy,
tried many Ways to divert him, but none reach'd
his Ca&s;e, or if they did, they under&s;tood not how
to advi&s;e him; for his Relations were mo&s;t like
him&s;elf, People of Levity and Gallantry, being
rich and gay; a Family that dealt very little in
Matters of Religion: He had an Aunt, his Mother's
Si&s;ter, who &s;eemed very much concerned about it;
but as &s;he thought, all that ailed him was his being
cro&s;t in his Affection, &s;he work'd her Thoughts
about, Night and Day to find out a Wife for him,
and &s;o to take his Thoughts off, and turn them a|nother
way: At length &s;he found out a young
Lady in the City, of a very great Fortune; for &s;he
had near 20000 <HI>l.</HI> to her Portion, and &s;he ply'd it
&s;o warmly with him, that he con&s;ented to treat of
it with her Friends, and his Circum&s;tances being
&s;uch as few Fortunes would refu&s;e, he found his
Way clear enough, and &s;o went to vi&s;it the young
Lady.</P>
<P>It was an odd kind of Court&s;hip you may be
&s;ure, and he went about it accordingly; for, <HI>as
he confe&s;s'd afterward,</HI> he re&s;olved, before he &s;aw her,
nor to like her, or any thing &s;he &s;aid or did; no,
nor ever to be in earne&s;t with her upon the thing;
only to je&s;t with and banter her, and he told his
Aunt &s;o before hand; however his Aunt would
not take him at his Word, but would have him
wait upon her, and &s;o he did; but he needed not
to have taken up any Re&s;olutions in the Ca&s;e, for he
was &s;poiled for Court&s;hip already, at lea&s;t for mo&s;t
of the Ladies of the Times; he had no Reli&s;h for
any of their Conver&s;ation; it was like Mu&s;ick to
one that had no Ear; all the Gayety and Flutter
<PB N="52" REF="59">
about them was lo&s;t upon him; his fir&s;t Mi&s;tre&s;s
had treated him with &s;uch &s;olid Rea&s;oning, &s;uch
&s;erious Talk, and had handled him after &s;uch a
Manner, that in &s;hort nothing but what was &s;eri|ous
had now any Reli&s;h with him; however, <HI>as I
have &s;aid,</HI> he re&s;olved to put a Force upon him&s;elf
&s;o far, as to go and &s;ee what kind of Thing his
new Mi&s;tre&s;s was, and accordingly he did go <HI>as
above.</HI></P>
<P>Bus when he had been one Evening there, and
had talk'd a little with her, he &s;oon &s;aw he had no
need of making Re&s;olutions; that he was in no
Danger of being in&s;nared by her; the Levity of
her Behaviour, the Emptine&s;s of her Di&s;cour&s;e, the
Weakne&s;s of her Conduct, made him &s;ick of her
the very fir&s;t Time; and when he came away, he
&s;aid to him&s;elf, <HI>Is it po&s;&s;ible for any Man in his Sen&s;es,</HI>
to bear this Shuttlecock, that had but been one half Hour
with my other Mi&s;tre&s;s! and away he came, not plea|&s;ed
at all: However he went again for &s;ome time,
till at la&s;t, not finding things mend, but rather
grow wor&s;e, he was re&s;olved he would talk a lit|tle
with her about Religion; and as he ask'd her
one Night, <HI>what Religion &s;he was of?</HI> &s;he an&s;wered
him ju&s;t in the very Words that he had banter'd
his other Mi&s;tre&s;s, O, &s;ays &s;he, <HI>I am a mighty good
Chri&s;tian.</HI> I believe &s;o, <HI>thought he,</HI> ju&s;t &s;uch ano|ther
as I was, when I was ask'd the &s;ame Que&s;tion,
However he conceal'd his Thoughts, re&s;olv'd to
carry it on a little farther, and gave her a mighty
civil An&s;wer, <HI>I don't doubt that, Madam,</HI> &s;ays he$
<HI>Well,</HI> &s;ays &s;he then, <HI>what would you have more?</HI> Nay,
<HI>nothing, Madam,</HI> returned he, <HI>I was only in je&s;t. O,</HI>
&s;ays &s;he, <HI>you want to know, what Opinion I am of? you &s;ee
I am no</HI> Quaker. <HI>No,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>Madam, I am not concern'd
about your Opinion; you may ea&s;ily have as much Religion
as I. Nay,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>I han't troubled my Head much
<PB N="53" REF="60">
about it; I don't know what I may do, when I keep a
Chaplain.</HI> He had enough of that Di&s;cour&s;e, and
&s;o he turn'd it off to &s;omething el&s;e; for tho' it was
almo&s;t the Pattern of what he had done with his
fir&s;t Mi&s;tre&s;s, yet it look'd with &s;uch a different
Face to him now, that, <HI>as he &s;aid afterwards,</HI> it
made his very Blood run cold within him; and
fill'd him with Horror at his own Picture, which,
he thought, now was &s;et before his Eyes in all its
ju&s;t Deformities. When he came away from her,
he &s;aid to him&s;elf, <HI>Well, now I &s;ee the true Force of
what that dear Creature argued for her&s;elf again&s;t me;
That to venture upon me, while I declared again&s;t Reli|gion,
was to run her&s;elf into the Pit</HI> with her Eyes open,
<HI>and ruin her&s;elf by meer premeditated Choice: It would be
ju&s;t &s;o with me in this Ca&s;e, if I &s;hould marry this But|terfly,
we &s;hould even go hand in hand very lovingly to
the Devil. This will not do my Bu&s;ine&s;s!</HI> So he put
an end to that Affair as &s;oon as he could, and re|&s;olved
to &s;ee her no more.</P>
<P>All this while he had no A&s;&s;i&s;tance from either
Books, Friends, Mini&s;ters, or any Body, only the
ju&s;t and natural Reflections of his own Rea&s;on: But
he was a Gentleman of polite Manners, and bred
to Conver&s;ation with Gentlemen of the be&s;t Qua|lity,
as well as of the be&s;t Parts, &s;o the Govern|ment
of him&s;elf was the more ea&s;y, and he re|&s;trained
the Dejection of his Spirits from making
any extraordinary Di&s;covery of it &s;elf, only that
he appeared a little more &s;edate, and more thought|ful
than before: and was a little more retir'd in his
way of Living; but not &s;o much, but that he came
often into publick Company, as before.</P>
<P>It happen'd one Time, that in promi&s;cuous Con|ver&s;ation
at a Chocolate-hou&s;e near the Court,
this Gentleman and &s;even or eight more being pre|&s;ent,
the Company fell from talking of News to
<PB N="54" REF="61">
talking of Religion: The Di&s;cour&s;e began about
the Differences which had happened in <HI>France</HI> late|ly,
and were then depending between the Pope
and the <HI>French</HI> Clergy; and of the <HI>Sorbonne</HI> or Fa|culty
of Theology, as they are called there, being
at that Time employed in drawing up a new Sy|&s;tem
of Divinity, or Body of Doctrine as they call'd
it; and as a Con&s;equence, it was hinted how likely
it was, that &s;uch a &s;trict Enquiry made by Men
of Learning and Virtue, into the Fundamentals
of Religion, &s;hould lead them at la&s;t into Pro|te&s;tant
Principles, and break that whole Kingdom
off from the Errors and Ignorance of Popery, open|ing
the Eyes of the People to Chri&s;tian Know|ledge.
There being &s;ome &s;ober and &s;en&s;ible Gen|tlemen
there, the Di&s;cour&s;e was carried on very
gravely and judiciou&s;ly, and the whole Company
&s;eemed to receive it with Plea&s;ure; when a cou|ple
of young Beaus, who happened to be in the
Room, beginning to be tir'd with a Thing &s;o much
out of their Way, one of them ri&s;es up on a &s;ud|den,
and &s;ays to the other, Come, <HI>Jack,</HI> I am
tir'd of this dull, religious Stuff; prithee let us go,
there's nothing in it: Ay, &s;ays t'other, with all
my Heart, I know nothing of the Matter: Come,
will you go to the Opera? There &s;at another
young Gentleman of their Acquaintance there, and
they pull'd him to come with them; No, &s;ays he,
I like this Di&s;cour&s;e very well, 'tis worth two O|pera's
to me: Why, &s;ays t'other, how long have
you been <HI>in Orders,</HI> pray? is &s;uch Stuff, as that, fit
Conver&s;ation for Gentlemen? Yes, &s;ays the &s;ober
young Gentleman, I think 'tis; Pray what can
there be in religious Conver&s;ation, that is unfit for
a Gentleman? There &s;at an ancient Nobleman
by, talking with a Clergyman, who hearing the
young Gentleman's Reply, fell a laughing; <HI>for this
<PB N="55" REF="62">
Di&s;cour&s;e put the former Subject to a Stop.</HI> On my
Word, Gentlemen, &s;ays his Lord&s;hip, Mr.&mdash;
has met with you: I don't think you can an&s;wer
his Que&s;tion. Yes, <HI>My Lord,</HI> &s;ays the fooli&s;h Beau,
<HI>I think 'tis below a Man of Quality to trouble his Head
about it.</HI> Pray, Sir, &s;ays the Lord, is it below a
Man of Quality to be a Chri&s;tian? O, my Lord,
&s;ays the other Beau, bantering and je&s;ting, <HI>we are
mighty good Chri&s;tians at the Opera;</HI> and turning a|way
to his Comerade, &s;ays he, Come, come, <HI>Jack,</HI>
prithee let's go; &s;o they went both out together,
for they did not care to ingage. Our Gentleman
li&s;tned with Plea&s;ure to all this Di&s;cour&s;e, till he
heard that Word <HI>mighty good Chri&s;tians,</HI> and then he
reflected upon his having u&s;ed that Expre&s;&s;ion to
his Mi&s;re&s;s, and how his la&s;t Lady gave him the
&s;ame Return, and he thought it was &s;o empty, &s;o
ab&s;urd a Turn, to a Thing of that Con&s;equence,
that he reproach'd him&s;elf with having talk'd &s;o
fooli&s;hly, and was a&s;ham'd to think, how like one
of the&s;e Fops he had appeared to her; and how he
had talk'd after the &s;ame &s;en&s;ele&s;s Way, which he
now look'd upon to be the mo&s;t empty, &s;canda|lous
Thing in the World.</P>
<P>When the two young Rakes were gone, the
Lord, turning to the young Gentleman that had
refu&s;ed them, complemented him upon his having
given them &s;o hand&s;om an An&s;wer, and having run
them both a-ground at one Enquiry. <HI>My, Lord,</HI>
&s;aid the Gentleman, <HI>if my Que&s;tion run them a-ground,</HI>
your Lord&s;hip's <HI>Que&s;tion quite confounded them.</HI> In|deed,
<HI>My Lord,</HI> continued he, <HI>'tis too much the No|tion</HI>
now, <HI>e&s;pecially among Per&s;ons of Quality, that
'tis below them to be religious.</HI> My Lord &s;aid, <HI>It was
&s;o indeed; but that he would fain ask &s;uch People, whe|ther
they thought</HI> St. Paul <HI>was a Gentleman, or no? and
whether he did not &s;hew as much good Breeding and good
<PB N="56" REF="63">
Manners, when he appeared before</HI> Agrippa, Fe&s;tus, <HI>and
the Governor</HI> Sergius Paulus, <HI>as any Nobleman in Bri|tain
could have done at the Bar of the Hou&s;e of Lords?</HI>
Upon this Subject his Lord&s;hip went on for half
an Hour, with a Di&s;cour&s;e &s;o hand&s;ome, &s;o to the
Purpo&s;e, and yet &s;o &s;erious, that it highly enter|tained
the Company; &s;hewing how it became eve|ry
Man of Quality to behave him&s;elf in Subjection
to the Rules given him by his Maker, as it became
every Subject to honour his Governor; how Piety
and Religion were the Glory of a Man of Quality,
and made Nobility truly illu&s;trious; that it was &s;o far
from being true, that Religion was not &s;uited to
the Life of a Gentleman, that it was certain a Man
could not truly be a Gentleman without it; that
Religion was &s;o far from being a dull flegmatick
Thing, and u&s;ele&s;s in Conver&s;ation, as was the fa&s;hi|onable
Nation of the Town, that really no Man
could be &s;o bright, &s;o perfectly ea&s;y, &s;o chearful,
&s;o &s;ociable, and &s;o always in humour for Society
as a <HI>Chri&s;tian;</HI> that Religion was the Beauty of
Conver&s;ation, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted to make it plea&s;ant and
agreeable; that without it Company was empty,
Di&s;cour&s;e unprofitable, Society unplea&s;ant; and in
&s;hort, that Conver&s;ation, without a Mixture of
&s;o$$thing regarding Religion, and a due Conne|ction
with it, was like a Dance without Mu&s;ick, a
Song without Mea&s;ure; like Poetry without Quan|tity,
or Speech without Grammar; that it was a
Mi&s;take to think Chri&s;tianity received Honour
from the Dignity of the Per&s;ons who profe&s;t it;
and his Lord&s;hip &s;aid, he wonder'd to hear Men
expre&s;s them&s;elves &s;o ab&s;urdly vain, as to &s;ay, &s;uch
a Man is <HI>an Honour to Religion;</HI> that the thing was
true only in the Rever&s;e, and it &s;hould be &s;aid,
Religion is an Honour to &s;uch a Per&s;on; that it
was a Contradiction in the very Nature of the
<PB N="57" REF="64">
Thing, to &s;ay, &s;uch a Man was noble, great, honour|able,
or a Gentleman without Religion; and it
might with every jot as much Sen&s;e be &s;aid &s;o of a
Per&s;on who had neither Birth, Family or Manners.</P>
<P>Our Gentleman came home charm'd with this
Di&s;cour&s;e, <HI>as indeed the whole Company were be&s;ides;</HI>
e&s;pecially con&s;idering the Authority and Dignity
of the Per&s;on who &s;poke it; his Mind was in&s;pir'd
with New Thoughts by it, both of Religion and
of him&s;elf; he not only &s;aw more of the Excel|lency
of Religion in it &s;elf, but began to &s;ee clear|ly
it was the Ornament of a Gentleman to be a
Chri&s;tian: It was with the greate&s;t Contempt,
that he now look'd back upon the Notion he had
formerly e&s;pous'd of a Gentleman's being above
troubling him&s;elf with &s;erious Things. How for-did
and bruti&s;h did the two Beaus appear, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI>
compared to that noble and excellent Per&s;on my
Lord&mdash;? How were they laugh'd at and de|&s;pis'd
by all the Gentlemen in the Company, and
look'd upon as Fellows fit for nothing, but in the
Highway to Di&s;a&s;ter: On the other hand it oc|curr'd
to him, how hand&s;omly did that young Gen|tleman
an&s;wer them? with what Mode&s;ty did he
&s;peak, and yet boldly, in Defence of a religious
Life? and what an Honour was paid him for it, by
all the Company, and by the Nobleman in parti|cular!
and then to think of what that Lord had
&s;aid, with what Applau&s;e it was received; how all
the Company li&s;tned to his Lord&s;hip, as to an
Oracle; how general a Con&s;ent was given to it
by all the Gentlemen; and <HI>in a Word,</HI> how agree|able
the Conver&s;ation of the Day was, put it all to|gether,
and yet, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> of eleven Gentlemen in
the Room, there was not one Man among them,
except the Clergyman, who were not above me
both in Quality and E&s;tate.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="65">
From all this he drew this general and happy
Conclu&s;ion for him&s;elf, <HI>viz.</HI> That he &s;hould never
be a complete Gentleman, till he became a religi|ous
Man; and that the more of a Chri&s;tian he was,
the &s;itter he &s;hould be for the Conver&s;ation of the
be&s;t and greate&s;t Men in the Kingdom; and in
con&s;equence of this Re&s;olution he re&s;olved to ap|ply
him&s;elf &s;eriou&s;ly to the Study of religious
Things.</P>
<P>To avoid the u&s;ual Diver&s;ions of the Town,
while the&s;e &s;erious Thoughts were upon him, he
re&s;olved to retire into the Country, to a little Seat
he had in <HI>Hamp&s;hire,</HI> remote from all Conver&s;ation,
and where he had no body to talk to, but his own
Servants, or &s;ome of the Neighbourhood, who
were all his Tenants. When he found him&s;elf &s;o
perfectly alone, it began to be a little too much
for him, and he grew very heavy, and a little hy|pocondriack;
his Mind was oppre&s;t with the

<P>I talk of being religious! and being a Chri&s;tian!
Why, I under&s;tand nothing of it, or how to go
about it: <HI>What is it?</HI> What is Religion? and what
is it to be a Chri&s;tian? He pos'd him&s;elf with the
Que&s;tions, and knew not what An&s;wer to give
him&s;elf, when it came thus into his Mind, Did
not that dear fir&s;t Preacher (<HI>meaning the young Lady
be bad courted</HI>) tell me what Religion was? and
how &s;he under&s;tood it, <HI>viz.</HI> a Reverence of God,
a Sen&s;e of his Wor&s;hip, and Impre&s;&s;ions of Duty
to him that made us. This certainly is Religion,
and this is to be religious: But which way mu&s;t I
go about it?</P>

He was &s;eriou&s;ly mu&s;ing on this Part one Even|ing,
walking all alone in a Field near his Hou&s;e,

the Want, which he felt, of an early Foundation
laid in his Mind by a religious Education. <HI>Sure,</HI>
&s;aid he to him&s;elf, <HI>we that are Men of Fortune, are

below them; for knowing little or nothing of it them&s;elves,
they had no other Excu&s;e to one another for the leaving
their Children intirely de&s;titute of it, but by pretending, it
was below their Quality.</HI> This flung him into a Re|flection,
which rai&s;ed this &s;udden pa&s;&s;ionate Ex|pre&s;&s;ion,

<P>He had wander'd &s;o long in the&s;e Meditations,

on, and he &s;carce knew he was &s;o far from his own
Hou&s;e, till he look'd about him, when he re&s;olv'd
to go back; &s;o he broke off his Thoughts a while,
and made a little ha&s;te homeward; in his Way he
nece&s;&s;arily went by a poor labouring Man's Door,
who, with a Wi&s;e and four Children, liv'd in a
&s;mall Cottage on the Wa&s;te, where he (<HI>the Gentle|man</HI>)
was Lord of the Manor; as he pa&s;t by, he
thought he heard the Man's Voice, and &s;tepping
up clo&s;e to the Door, he perceived that the poor
good old Man was praying to God with his Fami|ly:
<HI>As he &s;aid afterwards,</HI> his Heart &s;prung in his
Brea&s;t for Joy at the Occa&s;ion, and he li&s;ten'd ea|gerly
to hear what was &s;aid: The poor Man was,
it &s;eems, giving God Thanks for his Condition,
and that of his little Family, which he did with
great Affection; repeating how comfortably they
liv'd; how plentifully they were provided for, how
God had di&s;tingui&s;h'd them in his Goodne&s;s, that
they were alive, when others were &s;natch'd away
by Di&s;ea&s;es and Di&s;a&s;ters; in Health, when others
langui&s;h'd with Pain and Sickne&s;s; had Food, when
others were in Want; at Liberty, when others
were in Pri&s;on; were cloathed and cover'd, when
others were naked and without Habitation; con|cluding
with admiring and adoring the Wonders of
God's Providence and Mercy to them, who had de|&s;erved
nothing.</P>
<P>He was confounded, and <HI>&s;truck</HI> as it were <HI>&s;peech|le&s;s</HI>
at the Surprize of what he had heard: Nothing

Vent to his Thought, and throwing out his Arms,
<HI>Merciful God!</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>is this to be a Chri&s;tian!</HI> what
then have I been all my Days! what is this Man
thus thankful for! Why, my Dogs live better than
he does in &s;ome Re&s;pects, and is he on his Knees
adoring infinite Goodne&s;s for his Enjoyments! why
I have enjoy'd all I have, and never had the lea&s;t
Sen&s;e of God's Goodne&s;s to me, or ever once &s;aid,
<HI>God I thank thee</HI> for it, in my Life. Well might a
&s;ober Woman be afraid of me: Is this humble Tem|per,
this Thankfulne&s;s for meer Poverty! is this
the Effects of being a Chri&s;tian! why then Chri|&s;tians
are the happie&s;t People in the World! Why
I &s;hould hang my &s;elf, if I was to be reduced to a
Degree a hundred times above him; and yet here
is <HI>Peace,</HI> Ea&s;e of Mind, Satisfaction in Circum|&s;tances,
nay <HI>Thankfulne&s;s,</HI> which is the Exce&s;s of
human Felicity; and all this in a Man that ju&s;t
lives one degree above &s;tarving: We think our

Earth to &s;upport us that are their Landlords, and
who look upon us like their Lords and Ma&s;ters;
why this poor wretch is but a Drudge to tho&s;e
Drudges, a Slave of Slaves; and yet he gives God

Hope,</HI> the Poor would be <HI>of all Men the most mi&s;er|able;</HI>
ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, that our Portion is not
in this Life. But, Sir, <HI>and't plea&s;e you,</HI> I hope you
will not di&s;courage your&s;elf neither; for God has
not cho&s;en the Poor only, rich Men have Tempta|tions
from the World, and Hindrances very many,
and it is hard for them to enter into the Kingdom
of Heaven; but they <HI>are not &s;hut out,</HI> the Gate is
not barr'd upon them becau&s;e they are rich.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not how it is, <HI>William,</HI> nor which
way to begin; but I &s;ee &s;o many Ob&s;tructions in
the Work, that I doubt I &s;hall never get over it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not &s;ay &s;o, I be&s;eech you, Sir, <HI>and't
plea&s;e you;</HI> the Promi&s;e <HI>is made to all;</HI> and if God
has given you a Heart to &s;eek him, he will <HI>meet
you and ble&s;s you,</HI> for he has &s;aid, <HI>their Hearts &s;hall live
that &s;eek the Lord:</HI> Many great and rich Men have
been good Men; we read of good Kings and good
Princes; and if your Difficulties are great, you
have great Encouragements; for you that are great
Men, have great Opportunities to honour God,
and do good to his Church; poor Men are denied
the&s;e Encouragements; we can only &s;it &s;till and
be patient under the Weight of our Sorrows, and
our Poverty, and look for his Ble&s;&s;ing, which alone
<HI>makes rich, and adds no Sorrow to it.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>But tell me, <HI>William,</HI> what is the fir&s;t Step
&s;uch a poor uneducated Thing as I am &s;hould Take?
I &s;ee a Beauty in Religion, which I cannot reach;
<PB N="69" REF="76">
I &s;ee the Happine&s;s which thou enjoye&s;t, <HI>William,</HI>
in an humble, religious, correct Life: I would
give all my E&s;tate to be in thy Condition; I
would labour at the Hedge and the Ditch, as thou
do&s;t, could I have the &s;ame Peace within, and be
as thankful, and have &s;uch an intire Con&s;idence in
God as thou ha&s;t; I &s;ee the Happine&s;s of it, but
nothing of the Way how to obtain it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! Sir, <HI>and't plea&s;e you,</HI> you do not know
my Condition; I am a poor di&s;con&s;olate Creature;
I am &s;ometimes &s;o lo&s;t, &s;o dark, &s;o overwhelm'd
with my Condition, and with my Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, that I am
tempted to fear God <HI>has forgotten to be gracious;</HI> that
I am ca&s;t off, and left to &s;ink under my own Bur|then:
I am &s;o unworthy, &s;o forgetful of my Duty,
&s;o ea&s;ily let go my Hold, and ca&s;t off my Confi|dence,
that I fear often I &s;hall de&s;pair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what do you do then, <HI>William?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! Sir, I go mourning many a Day,
and waking many a Night; but I ble&s;s the Lord, I
always mourn after him; I always cleave to him;
I am not tempted to run from him; I know I am
undone, if I &s;eek Comfort in any other: <HI>Alas!
whither el&s;e &s;hould I go!</HI> I cry Night and Day, <HI>Return,
return, O Father!</HI> and re&s;olve to lye at his Foot;
and that <HI>if he &s;tay me, yet I will trust in him;</HI> and
ble&s;&s;ed be the God of my Hope, he does &s;end
Comfort and Peace, tho' &s;ometimes it is very long.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, <HI>William;</HI> and is this a di&s;con&s;olate
Condition! would you change your Condition
with me that am the <HI>rich Glutton?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>O do not &s;ay &s;o of your &s;elf, <HI>and't plea&s;e
you;</HI> God has touch'd your Wor&s;hip's Heart, I per|ceive,
with an earne&s;t De&s;ire after him; you have
a gracious Promi&s;e, that would greatly encourage
you, if you would but take it to your &s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="70" REF="77">
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Encourage me, <HI>William!</HI> that's impo&s;&s;ible:
what can encourage me? What Promi&s;e is it you
talk of, that looks towards me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, <HI>and't plea&s;e you,</HI> I heard you &s;ay, you
would change your Condition with &s;uch a poor
Wretch as I; you would labour at the Hedge and
the Ditch, to have the Knowledge of God and
Religion, and to be able to be thankful to him,
and have Confidence in him: This implies, that
you have a <HI>longing earnest De&s;ire after him,</HI> and after
the Knowledge of his Truth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed that is true, <HI>William.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Then there are many comforting Scrip|tures,
which &s;peak directly to you, Sir,</HI> viz. Ble&s;|&s;ed
are they that hunger and thir&s;t after Righteou&s;ne&s;s, for
they &s;hall be filled: The longing Soul &s;hall be &s;atisfy'd:
<HI>He will</HI> &s;atisfy the De&s;ires of all tho&s;e that fear him, <HI>and
the like.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what mu&s;t I do? which is the Way, an
ignorant Wretch mu&s;t take?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, <HI>and't plea&s;e you,</HI> the Way is plain: We
mu&s;t pray to him; Prayer is the fir&s;t Duty, and
Prayer is the greate&s;t Privilege we can enjoy in the
World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, <HI>William;</HI> but there is a great deal re|quired
in Prayer, that I am an utter Stranger to:
I never pray'd in my Life; no, nor I believe my
Father or Grandfather before me, <HI>William!</HI> I came
of a cur&s;ed Race, <HI>William,</HI> and I doubt 'tis en|tail'd
upon the Family like the E&s;tate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, Sir, do not &s;ay that: the Scripture is
plain, <HI>and't plea&s;e you,</HI> that the Children &s;hall not
be puni&s;hed for the Father's Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then certainly they mu&s;t not tread in
their Fathers Steps, as I do exactly, <HI>William?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true indeed, Sir, they mu&s;t not
tread in tho&s;e Steps.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="71" REF="78">
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what do&s;t talk then of Prayer being
the fir&s;t Duty? Why, if that be the fir&s;t Thing, I
mu&s;t not begin; for how can &s;uch a Creature as I
pray to God?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>As the Spirit of God will a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e, who&s;e
Hearts are towards him, &s;o we mu&s;t pray, that we
may be taught to pray.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it not a difficult Thing for a Man to pray
to God, <HI>William,</HI> that &s;carce ever thought of God
in all his Life?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir; but who do you think put tho&s;e
Thoughts into your Mind, which you now have?
and who open'd your Eyes, Sir, to &s;ee a Beauty
in Religion, as now you &s;ee? and touch'd your
Heart with &s;uch an earne&s;t De&s;ire after the Ways
and Things of God, as you now expre&s;ly &s;ay you
have? Do you think this is not of God, <HI>and't plea&s;e
you?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, <HI>William,</HI> I know not; it would be
a very delightful Thing to me, if I thought it was
&s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without Que&s;tion, Sir, <HI>it is:</HI> Man can
have no &s;uch Power; Nature prompts us to evil
Thoughts and evil De&s;ires, and to them only; <HI>the
Imagination of the Thoughts of our Hearts are evil, and
only evil;</HI> if there are any good Motions, or hea|venly
De&s;ires in the Heart, they are all from God.
<HI>Every good Giving, and every perfect Gift comes down
from above;</HI> 'tis his Power works them, his invi&s;i|ble
Grace forms all holy De&s;ires in the Soul.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; and what do you infer from thence,
<HI>William?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, <HI>and't plea&s;e you,</HI> if God has be|gun
a good Work, he will perfect it; if he has
turned your Face towards him, he will lift up your
Heart to him: To pray to God is as natural to a
<PB N="72" REF="79">
Convert, as to cry after the Father or Mother is
to an Infant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou &s;peake&s;t, <HI>William,</HI> with more Clear|ne&s;s
than ever I heard before; but 'tis a &s;trange
Thing to me to talk of praying to God: I pray!
that, except ju&s;t the common Road of going to
Church, cannot &s;ay that ever I kneel'd down to
pray to God once in all my Life! How &s;hall I
pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's &s;ad indeed, <HI>and't plea&s;e you!</HI> I am
&s;orry to hear your Wor&s;hip &s;ay &s;o; Does any Crea|ture
live and not pray to God! O dear! that's a
&s;ad dreadful Thing in truth! but however, Sir, do
not let that hinder you now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do&s;t mean hinder me? what can be
&s;aid to hinder me doing what I have no knowledge
in, no Notion of, no Inclination to?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>O Sir, and't plea&s;e you,</HI> you mi&s;take your
own Condition very much: Do not di&s;courage
your &s;elf thus; you know how to pray, better than
many that make much Noi&s;e with their Devotions,
I &s;ee it plainly</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pray! <HI>William,</HI> I pray! I tell thee, I never
pray'd in my Life, as I know of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>And't plea&s;e your Wor&s;hip not to be an|gry
with me for my plain Way&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee, <HI>William,</HI> be plain, and &s;peak free|lly
; don't <HI>wor&s;hip me</HI> and <HI>&s;ir me</HI> now; talk to me, as
it I were your Neighbour or Comerade; the&s;e are
not Things to be talk'd of with C$inges and Bows:
I am a wretched, contemptible, poor, rich Man,
thou are a poor, rich, happy Chri&s;tian; talk plain|ly
the cour&s;er the better, I like it be&s;t; there will
be no Difference, <HI>William,</HI> between thee and I
hereafter, but what will be on thy &s;ide; tell me
therefore, what you mean, <HI>William,</HI> by my Praying?</P>
</SP>
<PB N="73" REF="80">
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, if you allow me to be plain
then, I &s;ay, you mi&s;take your own Condition, and
thereby put off the Comfort you might receive;
I &s;ay, you do pray, and know better how to pray,
than many that appear as if they pray'd every
Day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mu&s;t explain your &s;elf, <HI>William,</HI> I do
not under&s;tand you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, tho&s;e earne&s;t De&s;ires you have
after the Knowledge of God, and after the true
Wor&s;hip of God, <HI>which is the Sum of Religion,</HI> I &s;ay,
tho&s;e earneft De&s;ires are really Prayers in their
own Nature; &s;incere Wi&s;hes of the Heart for Grace
are Prayers to God for Grace; Prayer it &s;elf is no|thing
but tho&s;e Wi&s;hes and De&s;ires put into Words,
and the fir&s;t is the e&s;&s;ential Part; for there may
be Words u&s;ed without the De&s;ire, and that is not
Prayer, but a Mockery of God; but the De&s;ires
of the Heart may be Prayers even without the
Words.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>You &s;urprize me a little, <HI>William.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be&s;ides, Sir, <HI>and't plea&s;e you,</HI> tho&s;e earne&s;t
De&s;ires you have after Religion, and after the Know|ledge
of God, will force you to pray fir&s;t or la&s;t,
even in a verbal Prayer; they will break out like
a Flame that cannot be withheld; your Heart will
pray when you know not of it: Praying to God,
Sir, is the fir&s;t Thing a Sen&s;e of Religion dictates,
as a Child cries as &s;oon as it is born.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! <HI>William,</HI> I know nothing of it; I am
&s;uch an unaccountable Wretch, God knows, I
know nothing what belongs to praying, not I;
thou fa&s;t let me &s;ee farther into it, bythat thou &s;aid&s;t
ju&s;t now, than ever I &s;aw or heard before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, look ye, now, <HI>and't plea&s;e you,</HI> I
told you it would break out, when you knew not
<PB N="74" REF="81">
of it, and you would pray to God be&s;ore you
were aware: Did you not pray ju&s;t now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La. Pray!</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what did I &s;ay? I &s;aid, I know
nothing of Prayer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, that was not all: What is the Mean|ing
of tho&s;e Words, <HI>Alas, William!</HI> and whence
came that <HI>Sigh,</HI> when you called your &s;elf that hard
Name? and what was the Sen&s;e of your Soul but
this, <HI>God be merciful to me, and teach me to pray; for
alas I know nothing what belongs to praying:</HI> Was not
all this praying?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, <HI>William,</HI> my Heart had &s;uch a kind
of Meaning; but I cannot form the Thought into
Words, no not in my very Soul.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's all one, Sir: God that moves the
Soul, certainly hears his own Motion; how &s;hould
he but hear it? is it not his own working! <HI>The
Preparation of the Heart, and the An&s;wer of the Tongue,
is of the Lord:</HI> He will hear every &s;incere De&s;ire,
which he forms in your Soul, whether it be con|ceived
into Words or no; for it is the Voice of his
own Spirit and Grace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou art a comforting Preacher, <HI>William;</HI>
I don't wonder you enjoy &s;uch a &s;hining Beam of
Light in your own Soul, when you have &s;uch a
Sen&s;e of Things as this; you &s;hall be my In&s;tru|ctor,
<HI>William,</HI> I may call you Father rather; for
thou art better to me than ten Fathers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Sir, <HI>and't plea&s;e you,</HI> my Di&s;comforts are
very great, and the Beam you &s;peak of is very dim
in me; <HI>do not &s;peak &s;uch Things of me;</HI> it makes me
very &s;ad; for I know my own Darkne&s;&s;, I am a
poor de&s;pis'd Creature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but God may make you an In&s;tru|ment
of Good to me, or to any one he plea&s;e: I
never had thus much In&s;truction in my Life, <HI>Wil|liam;</HI>
<PB N="75" REF="82">
you will not be backward to do good, I
hope, if it be thus ca&s;t in your Way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hall be very glad, if &s;uch a Worm, as I
am, &s;hould be an In&s;trument in God's Hand to
comfort or inform your Wor&s;hip, and &s;hall prai&s;e
God for this Occa&s;ion, as long as I live; and indeed
I rejoyce, <HI>and't plea&s;e you,</HI> to &s;ee your Wor&s;hip in|quiring
after the&s;e Things; I pray God increa&s;e
the Knowledge of him&s;elf in your Mind, and
comfort you with the Hope of his Pre&s;ence and
Ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I thank you, <HI>William.</HI></P>
</SP>

<P>Look you now, Sir, <HI>and't plea&s;e you,</HI> did
you not pray then again?</P>

<P>I joyn'd with you, <HI>William;</HI> I don't know;
but if that be praying, I think I did pray.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thus God will move your Heart to pray
to him: and I be&s;eech your Wor&s;hip to read the
Scriptures; read them much, read them &s;eriou&s;ly,
and pray, Sir, ob&s;erve this one Thing, when you
read, which I have experienc'd often, and very
comfortably; and I dare &s;ay, you and every one
that reads the Word of God, with de&s;ire of a Ble&s;|&s;ing,
will experience the like, <HI>viz.</HI> When you are
reading, and come to any Place that touches you,
and that your Mind is affected with, <HI>you &s;hall find</HI>
even whether you will or no, your Heart will eve|ry
now and then lift it &s;elf up thus, <HI>Lord! make
good this Word to me! Lord! draw my Heart thus to thee!
Lord! help me thus to &s;eek thee,</HI> and the like; and be
not afraid to call that Praying; for <HI>mental Petition</HI>
is Prayer as well as Words; and is, perhaps the
be&s;t mov'd Prayer, and the be&s;t expre&s;t in the
World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="76" REF="83">
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will per&s;uade me, <HI>William,</HI> that I both
have pray'd already, and &s;hall again, whether I
will or no, and whether I know any thing of it or
no, and that I want no teaching.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Sir, does a Child want to be taught
to cry?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will that Simile hold, <HI>William?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed it will, Sir: Read the Scripture; if
God's Word reaches your Heart, you will not need
to be taught to pray</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>I told you, <HI>William,</HI> you hardly knew who
you were talking to: You talk of my <HI>reading the
Scripture;</HI> why, I'll tell thee, <HI>William,</HI> I han't a
Bible in the World, and never had one in my Life:
There's the Manor-hou&s;e yonder; I que&s;tion whe|ther
God was ever pray'd to in it, or his Name
mention'd there, except prophanely, or perhaps
to &s;wear by it, &s;ince 'twas built: why you know
as well as I, what a Family it was that liv'd in it,
when my Father purcha&s;ed it; they were as much
Strangers to Religion, <HI>William,</HI> as thou art to
<HI>Greek.</HI> and <HI>Hebrew;</HI> and ours were but little better,
that came after them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fear, indeed, <HI>and't plea&s;e your Wor&s;hip,</HI> it
was &s;o: Poor Gentlemen! they liv'd badly indeed;
very badly: Alas! Gentlemen mu&s;t not be told
of it by us poor Men; but they were a &s;ad wicked
Family, I remember it well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, <HI>William,</HI> thou can'&s;t lend me a Bible
can&s;t thou not? and I'll read it all over while I
&s;tay here.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and't plea&s;e your Wor&s;hip, I'll lend
you a Bible; I'll bring it in the Morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do, <HI>William,</HI> and come and &s;tay with me
to Morrow; I'll make thee amends for thy Day's

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank your Wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>They were now come to the Manor-hou&s;e, and
he was loth to detain him, becau&s;e it was late, and
becau&s;e he was &s;o affected with the Di&s;cour&s;e they
had had, that he wanted very much to be alone
again.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he came into his own Hou&s;e, he lock'd
him&s;elf into a Parlour, and began to con&s;ider with
great Seriou&s;ne&s;s all the&s;e Things, and e&s;pecially
what the poor Man had &s;aid to him about praying
to God; and as his Thoughts were intent upon the
Meaning of Prayer, the Nature of it, and the Ad|vantages
of it, at every Turn of the&s;e Thoughts
he found a &s;ecret kind of Hint like a Voice <HI>in him,</HI>
not a Voice <HI>to him,</HI> O that I could pray! O if I
could but pray as that poor Man does! How hap|py
&s;hould I be, if I could but pray to God! and the
like: He was not aware of the&s;e Movements; they
&s;eemed to be w$ought in his Affections perfectly
involuntary and &s;udden; and they pa&s;s'd over with|out
being notie'd or ob&s;erv'd, even by him&s;elf, till
after a good while they returned &s;tronger and more
frequent upon him, &s;o that he not only perceived
it, but remembred how often his Heart had thrown
out tho&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions; when on a &s;udden the poor
Man's Words came into his Mind with &s;uch a
Force, as if the Man him&s;elf had been there; <HI>why
this was praying;</HI> certainly I have been praying all
this while, and knew it not.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="85">
Upon this Reflection, it was impo&s;&s;ible for him
to expre&s;s, <HI>as be &s;aid afterwards,</HI> what a &s;trange
Rapture of Joy po&s;&s;e&s;s'd his Mind, and how his
Heart was turn'd within him; then he fell into the
&s;ame &s;ecret Ejaculations of another Kind, <HI>viz.</HI> of
Admiration, Prai&s;es, Thank&s;giving, and meer A|&s;toni&s;hment;
but &s;till without &s;peaking, otherwi&s;e
than a kind of mental Voice, &s;ounding or inject|ing
Words into his Mind &s;uch as the&s;e, Lord! &s;hall
I be brought to pray to God! I that have never
been told &s;o much as how to mention his Name!
I that have never known any thing of God, or my
&s;elf! or have been taught any thing of my Duty
to him! &s;hall I be taught to pray! and taught by
who! by this poor de&s;picable Creature, that, at
another time, I would not have &s;poken to, if he
had made me twentyBows and Scrapes! HisTongue
then was let loo&s;e, and he cry'd out, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be God
that ever I came near that poor Man.</HI></P>
<P>He continued all that Evening filled with com|forting
Reflections, and with a kind of inward
Peace and Satis&s;action; which, as he had never
known before, &s;o he knew not how to de&s;cribe or
relate it, or indeed how to manage it: In the Morning
he found the &s;ame Meditation and the &s;ame Light|ne&s;s
upon his Spirits return'd, and he remembred
what the poor Man had pray'd for, for him, <HI>viz.</HI>
That he might be comforted with the Hopes of the
Pre&s;ence and Ble&s;&s;ing of God, to which his Heart
had &s;o readily &s;aid <HI>Amen:</HI> and now he long'd for
the poor Man coming with the Bible.</P>
<P>The poor Man's was likewi&s;e mightily affected
with his Ca&s;e, con&s;idering him a young Gentleman
of &s;uch a Family and Fortune; and who was &s;o far
above him, as that, tho' he was his Landlord, he
dur&s;t never offer to &s;peak to him in his Life, but
with the greate&s;t Submi&s;&s;ion and Di&s;tance; how he
<PB N="79" REF="86">
&s;hould come to call him out, and to talk to him,
<HI>of &s;uch Things e&s;pecially,</HI> and in &s;o &s;erious a Manner.</P>
<P>He then reflected with a &s;erious Joy, that this
young Gentleman &s;hould be thus touch'd with a
&s;olid Sen&s;e of Religion and good Things, <HI>for it
was ea&s;y to &s;ee, that it was not a &s;light or an in&s;incere
Work upon his Mind;</HI> it rejoyc'd his Heart, that the
Heir of the E&s;tate &s;hould be thus likely to prove a
good Man;and it pre&s;ently occurr'd to his Thoughts
how great a Ble&s;&s;ing &s;uch a Gentleman might be
to the County, to the Poor, and to the unin&s;tru|cted
People round him; as well by reforming their
Manners, and re&s;training their Vices, as perhaps by
bringing Religion to be accepted and received a|mong
them by his Example.</P>
<P>The&s;e were &s;ome of the Thoughts he came along
with, and he pray$d to God, as he walk'd, very ear|ne&s;tly,
that he might be made an In&s;rument to
bring the Soul of this Gentleman to the Know|ledge
of God, and to bow at the Foot&s;tool of his
Redeemer as a true Penitent.</P>
<P>His Prayers were not in vain: Prayer put up
from &s;uch a Principle, and with &s;uch a Spirit, &s;el|dom
is made in vain</P>
<P>He came to the Gentleman, while he was in Bed;
for he had given order to his Servants to bring him
up to his Chamber; there he deliver'd him the Bi|ble,
and told him he hop'd he would find in it both
Encouragement and Direction in the great Work
which he was going about, and that God would
ble&s;s it to him, and would &s;upply by his Grace all
the Wants of early In&s;truction, which he had &s;o
much complain'd of.</P>
<P>He received the poor Man with a glad Heart,
made him &s;it down by him, and told him, God
had made him the In&s;trument of &s;o much Good to
<PB N="80" REF="87">
him, that he could not part with him any more
while he &s;taid in the Country.</P>

brings his Child to our Lord to be healed, when
po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of an evil Spirit: Our Lord asks him, if he

<P>O Sir! I &s;aw your very Heart; I know
you pray'd; I know you &s;aid <HI>Amen</HI> in your very
Soul to that Word: Glory be to the Grace of God,
and to the Word of God for you; the Scripture,
read with &s;uch a Heart as yours now is, will &s;oon

out thus; Lord! what a Creature have I been, that
have liv'd without the Teachings of the Scripture

<HEAD>DIALOGUE III.</HEAD>
<P>_WE mu&s;t now go back to the Family, which
we began with: The Father of the
young Ladies was gone into the Coun|try
to vi&s;it his Si&s;ter, who was newly
become a Widow; little thinking whatever his
elde&s;t Daughter had &s;aid to him, that his younge&s;t
Daughter would make &s;uch &s;hort Work with her
Lover in his Ab&s;ence; and that &s;he would quite
put an end to his Court&s;hip all at one Blow, as &s;he
had done, before he came Home again:</P>
<P>He &s;pent &s;ome little Time at his Si&s;ter's, to com|fort
her, and a&s;&s;i&s;t her in her Affairs, after the
Lofs of' her, Husband; and particularly becau&s;e her
elde&s;t Son being of Age, and ju&s;t upon marrying,
&s;he intended to remove; the Hou&s;e which was the
Seat of the Family being to be &s;itted up for her
new <HI>Daughter in Law:</HI> Upon the&s;e Circum&s;tances
he began the following Di&s;cour&s;e with his Si&s;ter.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, pray Si&s;ter, what kind of a Lady has
my Nephew got? is he well marry'd?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, Brother, I can hardly tell, how to
an&s;wer you that Que&s;tion; I believe every body
will be better pleas'd than I.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Si&s;ter, what is the Ca&s;e, pray; that
you are &s;o difficult?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="85" REF="92">
<SPEAKER>Sist</SPEAKER>
<P>O Brother! the main Difficulty, that has
made me all my Days the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of all
Women.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! Religion I warrant you; you would
have had him have marry'd a Nun?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I don't know why I &s;hould de&s;ire a
religious Woman to come into the Family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never &s;aw the like of you, <HI>Si&s;ter,</HI> you are
always a complaining; you have had one of the
be&s;t humour'd, goode&s;t condition'd, merrie&s;t Fel|lows
in the World for this five and twenty Years,
and yet you call your &s;elf a <HI>Mi&s;erable</HI> Woman: what
could you ask in a Husband, that you had not in
Sir <HI>James?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Brother, is this a Time for me to tell
you what I wanted in Sir <HI>James,</HI> when he is in his
Grave? I have wanted nothing in him, that a Wo|man
could de&s;ire in a Husband; he was rich in his
E&s;tate, a lovely, compleat, hand&s;ome Gentleman
in his Per&s;on, and held it to the la&s;t; he was the
be&s;t-humour'd Man, that ever Woman had, and kind
<HI>as a Husband</HI> to the la&s;t degree; I never &s;aw him in
a Pa&s;&s;ion in my Life; he was a Man of good Sen&s;e
and good Learning; a Man of Honour, good
Breeding, and good Manners; none went beyond
him; all the Country knows it, and lov'd him for
it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro. Very well;</SPEAKER>
<P>and yet my Si&s;ter a mi&s;erable
Woman! would not any Man laugh at you? I
think, Si&s;ter, if ever you were a <HI>mi&s;erable Woman,</HI>
it is now; becau&s;e you have lo&s;t him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, that's true too; I am &s;o now, many
Ways, and &s;ome perhaps that you do not think of,
Brother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know what you mean again; I warrant
you ha' been whining over him, to think what is
become of him now: Prithee what's that to you,
<PB N="86" REF="93">
or I? what can you by your Concern for him, do
in this Ca&s;e, one way or other? can't you leave
him to God's Mercy, now he's gone?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Brother, it is in vain to an&s;wer you;
I mu&s;t leave him to God's Mercy, and &s;o we mu&s;t
leave our &s;elves; but do you think, 'tis not an af|flicting
dreadful Thing to me, that know how he
liv'd, and how he dy'd, to reflect upon his Condi|tion,
if I had any Love for him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, how did he live? he liv'd like a Gen|tleman,
as he was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true; and that, as Times go, <HI>Bro|ther,</HI>
is to live like a Heathen; you know well e|nough,
what a Life I have had with him on that
only Account; you know, he was &s;o far from hav|ing
any Sen&s;e of Religion, or of his Maker, on
his Mind, that he made a Je&s;t and a Mock of it all
his Days, even to the la&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know he did not trouble him&s;elf much
about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, he not only did not him&s;elf, but he
did not really love to have any body about him
religious: I have known many Gentlemen that
have had no Religion them&s;elves, yet value it in
others, and value and reverence good Men; but
he thought all People Hypocrites, that talk'd of any
thing religious; and could not abide to &s;ee any
Appearance of it in the Hou&s;e; it was the only
Thing we had any Difference about, all our Days.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I think you were a great Fool to have
any Difference with him about that: Could not
you ha' kept your Religion to your &s;elf, and have
let him alone to be as merry and as frolick&s;ome as
he would without it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I was oblig'd to do that, you may be
&s;ure; you know it well enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="87" REF="94">
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, I know he &s;erv'd you many a
merry Prank about your religious doings, &s;uch as
putting every now and then a Ballad in your Pray|er
Book, or your P&s;alm Book; and I think he put
the Story of <HI>Tom. Thumb</HI> once in one of Dr. <HI>Tillot|&s;on</HI>'s
Sermons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; 'twas two Leaves out of <HI>Don Quixot:</HI>
He did a great many &s;uch things as tho&s;e to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>But they were all Frolicks, there was no|thing
of Pa&s;&s;on or ill Nature in them: Did not
he write &s;omething in the Children's <HI>Spelling-Book</HI>
once, and make them get it without Book in&s;tead
of the Le&s;&s;on you had &s;et them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, he play'd me thou&s;and Tricks
that way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think, once he pa&s;ted a Receipt to make a
Tanzy or a Cake, ju&s;t next to one of the Que&s;ti|ons
of the Catechi&s;m, where your Daughter's Le&s;|&s;on
was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay; and every now and then he would
pa&s;te a &s;ingle printed Word, that he cut out of
&s;ome other Book, ju&s;t over another Word in their
Books, &s;o cunningly, that they could not perceive
it, and make them read Non&s;en&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what Harm was there in all that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, it &s;hewed his general Contempt of
good Things, and making a Mock of them; other|wi&s;e
the thing was not of &s;o much Value.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and wherein was you mi&s;erable, pray,
in all this? I don't under&s;tand you in that at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why in this, that he was not at all a religi|ous
Man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what was that to you &s;till?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, fir&s;t, Brother, there was all <HI>Family-Religion</HI>
lo&s;t at one Blow; there could not be &s;o
much as the Appearance of wor&s;hiping or ac|knowledging
the God that made us; nay, we
<PB N="88" REF="95">
&s;carce ask'd him leave to eat our Meat, but in &s;e|cret,
as if we were a&s;ham'd of it; Sir <HI>James</HI> never
&s;o much as &s;aid Grace or gave Thanks at Table in
his Life, that I remember.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>And they that do, make it nothing but a
Ceremony, and do it for Fa&s;hion-&s;ake not that
they think it &s;ignifies any thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, let them do it for Fa&s;hion-&s;ake then,
if they will, but let them do it; 'tis the mo&s;t ra|tional
Thing in the World, while we own that
God gives us our Meat, that we &s;hould ask him
Leave to eat it; and thank him for it when we have
done: But alas! this is but a &s;mall Part of the ill
Con&s;equences of an irreligious Family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, what more is there? for this is no|thing,
but what is in thou&s;ands of Families, who
pretend to Religion on all &s;ides.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, all <HI>Relative Religion</HI> was lo&s;t too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro. Relative Religion!</SPEAKER>
<P>Si&s;ter, what do you mean
by that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> mean by it, that Religion which
ought to be between a Man and his Wi&s;e; &s;uch as
comforting, encouraging, and directing one ano|ther,
helping one another on in the Way to Hea|ven,
a&s;&s;i&s;ting one another in Chri&s;tian Duties,
praying with and for one another, and much more
which I could name; and which, without doubt,
pa&s;&s;es to their mutual Comfort and Delight be|tween
a Man and his Wife, where they are mutu|ally
agreed in wor&s;hiping and &s;erving God, and
walking on in the happy Cour&s;e of a religious Life:
All this has been lo&s;t, and it has been a &s;ad Lo&s;s to
me, Brother; we have all need of Helps, and it
is not every one that con&s;iders, or indeed that
knows, what Help, what Comfort, what Sup|port,
a religious Husband and Wife are or may be
<PB N="89" REF="96">
to one another; this, I &s;ay, has been a &s;ad Lo&s;s to
me I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>The&s;e are nice Things; but methinks if
you could not have tho&s;e Helps from your Hu&s;|band,
you might find them in other Things, &s;uch

<P>'Tis &s;uch a Lo&s;s, Brother, that if I were to
live my Days over again, I would not marry a

our Duty, our Felicity, in this World, and
our way to the next, what Comfort, what Hap|pine&s;s
can there be, where the&s;e are wanting in the
Head of the Family?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is better to be &s;ure, where they may be
had, but to lay all the Happine&s;s of Life upon it,
as if a Man or a Woman could not be religious by
them&s;elves, without they were both &s;o together,
I do not &s;ee that; I think you carry it too far.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll convince you, that I do not carry it too
far at all; I do not &s;ay, a Man or Woman may not
be religious by them&s;elves, tho' the Husband or
Wife be not &s;o; but I &s;ay, all the Help and Com|fort
of <HI>Relative Religion</HI> is lo&s;t; the Benefit and
Value of which none knows, but they that enjoy
it, or feel the Want of it; but there is another
Lo&s;s, which I have not nam'd, and which my
Heart bleeds in the Sen&s;e of, every Day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's that I wonder?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="90" REF="97">
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why Children! Brother, Children! you
&s;ee I have five Children: what dreadful Work has
this want of <HI>Family-Religion</HI> made among my poor
Children!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir <HI>James</HI> did not hinder you in&s;tru|cting
your Children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did he not? 'tis true he did not, when they
were little; but has he not by Example and want
of Re&s;traint encouraged all manner of Levity,
Vanity, Folly, nay, and even Vice it &s;elf in them?
Do you think Children, thus let loo&s;e to humour
their young Inclinations, and to the full &s;wing of
their Plea&s;ures, would not &s;oon &s;natch them&s;elves
out of the Arms of their Mother, and deliver
them&s;elves from the Importunities of one that had
no other Authority with them than that of Affe|ction?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, truly there is &s;omething in that; but
I do not &s;ee, that your Children are much the
wor&s;e; there's your elde&s;t Son, Sir <HI>James</HI> that is
now, he is a pretty young Gentleman, I hear a ve|ry
good Character of him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly, Brother, as Times go now with
Gentlemen, we may be thankful, neither he nor his
Brother are debauch'd or vicious; and I am thank|ful
for it; they have good Characters for mo|de&s;t
pretty Gentlemen, as you &s;ay; but &s;till, Bro|ther,
the main Thing is wanting; I cannot be
partial to them, tho' they are my own; there is
not the lea&s;t Sen&s;e or Notion of Religion in them;
they cannot &s;ay they have no Knowledge of it, I
took Care to deprive them of that Excu&s;e, as ear|ly
as they knew any thing: But it goes no Father;
my elde&s;t Son will tell me &s;ometimes, he has
as much Religion as a Gentleman of a Thou&s;and
a Year &s;hould have; and his Brother tells me, if I
would have had him have any Religion, I &s;hould
<PB N="91" REF="98">
have kept our Pari&s;h Living for him, and bred him
a Par&s;on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are very merry with you then, I find,
upon that Subject.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a dreadful Je&s;t to me, Brother; I am
far from taking it merrily; you know, I was other|wi&s;e
brought up, our Father and Mother were of an|other
&s;ort of People; they united their very Souls
in the Work of God, they joyn'd in every good
Thing with the utmo&s;t Affection; they lov'd the
Souls as well as the Bodies of us their Children;
the Family was a Hou&s;e of chearful Devotion;
God was &s;erv'd Night and Day; and, <HI>in a Word,</HI>
as they liv'd, &s;o they dy'd; they dropt comfort|ably
off, and went, as it were, Hand in Hand to
Heaven.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, Si&s;ter, you &s;ee, we that were
their Children were not all alike; there's our
Brother <HI>Jack,</HI> and our Si&s;ters <HI>Sarah,</HI> and <HI>Betty</HI> what
can be &s;aid about them? Pray what Religion are
they of?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you, what can be &s;aid, and what
will &s;tick clo&s;e to them one time or other, <HI>viz.</HI> If
they are lo&s;t, it is not for want of good In&s;truction,
or good Example; they cannot blame Father or
Mother; it has been all their own; Parents may
beg Grace for their Children, but they cannot give
it them; they may teach their Children good things,
but they cannot make them learn; that is the Work
of God, and Parents mu&s;t &s;ubmit it to him; but
when Parents do nothing; nay, rather by Exam|ple
and Encouragement, lead their Children into
Wickedne&s;s; what a dreadful thing is that!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but our two Si&s;ters were not led into
Wickedne&s;s; and yet, as I &s;aid, they value Religi|on
as little as any Body.</P>

<PB N="92" REF="99">

<P>What do you mean by ruin'd? they are not
ruin'd, I hope.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mean as to their Principles, Brother, which
I think is the wor&s;t &s;ort of Ruin; they were ruin'd
by marrying profligate irreligious Husbands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know, what you mean by profligate,
I think they are both very well marry'd.</P>

<P>Yes, as you call well marry'd, and that I
call being undone.</P>

<P>Truly, Brother, ju&s;t the other Extreme, he
has a wild, giddy, Playhou&s;e-bred Wife; full of Wit,
and void of Grace, that never had any Religion,
nor knew what the Meaning of it was; <HI>this has
ruin'd him:</HI> My Brother was &s;ober, well taught,
well inclin'd young Man, as could be de&s;ired, but
getting &s;uch a Tempter at his Elbow, in&s;tead of a
Wife to help him on to Heaven, &s;he has led him
hood-wink'd to the Gates of Hell, and goes chear|fully
along with him; a &s;ad In&s;tance, Brother, of
the Want of Family Religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but what's all this so what we are

<P>I cannot &s;ay that; few Parents, tho' they

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, that has been the Ca&s;e of my Fami|ly;

<P>I warrant you, they do not think &s;o, Si&s;ter:
Religion makes us good Chri&s;tians, that is confe&s;t,
but I do not &s;ee it makes a Gentleman; what is
more frequent, than to &s;ee Religion make Men
cynical, and &s;our in their Tempers, moro&s;e and
&s;urly in their Conver&s;ation; they think them&s;elves
above the Practice of good Manners or good Hu|mour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is all by the Mi&s;take of the Thing;
'tis want of Religion, that makes Men thus; it is
in good Breeding, as it is in Philo&s;ophy; a little
Phil&s;ophy, a little Learning makes a Man an A|thei&s;t,
a great deal brings him back, and makes him
a Chri&s;tian; &s;o a little Religion makes a Man a
Churl, but a great deal teaches him to know him|&s;elf,
and be a Gentleman; when good Principles
joyn with good Manners, how &s;hould they but il|lu&s;trate
the Education, and &s;et off the Breeding
of a Man of Quality; as it's a Mi&s;take to &s;ay, that
Jewels &s;hould be worn by none but homely Women,
it is ju&s;t the contrary; &s;o Religion adorns Edu|cation,
as Jewels give real Beauty a double Lu&s;tre.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you are wrapt up in the&s;e Notions,
Si&s;ter; I fancy you have been documenting my

got ju&s;t the &s;ame things in her Noddle, and &s;he
has carried her Scruples to &s;uch a length, that &s;he
had like to have refu&s;ed the be&s;t Match, that ever
will be offer'd her, as long as &s;he lives; but I believe
I rattled her out of it, when I came away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am perhaps the fuller of it, becau&s;e it has
been the Ruin of my Family, and of my Children,
and I think if ever poor Woman was unhappy with
a Gentleman, that had not one had Quality in him,
it was I; Sir <HI>James,</HI> as I told you, was &s;uch a Man
for every thing el&s;e, as there are few &s;uch in the

us all.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>You would make any one laugh to hear you
talk of being <HI>ruin'd:</HI> why are you not left happy,
ea&s;y, plea&s;ant? is not your elde&s;t Son a Baronet,
and has 1400<HI>l.</HI> a year? is not your &s;econd Son very
well provided for? have not your Daughters 5000<HI>l.</HI>
a-piece Fortune left them? and are not you left &s;o
rich, you know not what to do with it all!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not &s;peak of Ruin, as you under&s;tand
it, Brother; I think a Family without Religion is
a Family ruin'd, and that in the wor&s;t Sen&s;e, that
Ruin can be under&s;tood in; if I were to marry
again, I would not marry the be&s;t Duke in the Na|tion,
that would not endeavour to carry me to Hea|ven,
and to go there him&s;elf; The Command of
the Scripture is plain in it, <HI>Be not unequally yoked,

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why Sir <HI>James</HI> did not hinder your Prayers,
Si&s;ter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did he not? Sir <HI>James</HI> is in his Grave, and
'tis not my Part to &s;ay what he did; but 'tis the
mutual Prayers of Husband and Wife together, that's
meant in that Scripture: Do you think Sir <HI>James</HI>
ever pray'd with his Wife?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I believe he did not indeed, nor with
any body el&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>And do you think, that's the Life of a Chri|&s;tian,
or the Manner of a Chri&s;tian Family, Bro|ther?
you and I were not bred up &s;o, and yet our
Father was a Gentleman, and wanted neither Fa|mily
nor Fortune equal to any of them: Sir <HI>James</HI>
is in his Grave, and I have no more to &s;ay of that;
but if I were as young, as I was when I marry'd
him, and were to choo&s;e again, I would not marry
the be&s;t Nobleman in the Nation, if he was not a
religious Man; all Enjoyments in the World are
nothing without it, unle&s;s I re&s;olved to ca&s;t off all
Religion too, and where would that end!</P>

<P>Be&s;ides, Brother, con&s;ider another thing:
how many young Women and young Men too,

marrying been a Snare to? that when they come
to husbands with no Religion, or to giddy, loo&s;e,
profane Wifes, they drop all their own Principles,
and become empty of all Religion too at la&s;t: you

can &s;ay little to it; but if this be it, that &s;he re|fu&s;es

right; &s;he is a good religious Child her&s;elf, my

&s;he marrys a Gentleman, <HI>as the Times go now,</HI> that

you what I have been, I have been a <HI>Memento</HI> to

&s;hew them the Danger of it by their Aunt's Exam|ple:
I Pray God, they may take the Warning: I
know &s;he was not wanting to them in her In&s;tru|ction,
and in cautioning them again&s;t every thing
that was hurtful; and if &s;he forgot this of caution|ing
them never to marry a Man of no Religion,
then &s;he was not that wi&s;e Woman I took her for.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not who has caution'd her, nor who
has in&s;tructed her, but if I had not took it up very
warmly, &s;he had ruin'd her&s;elf with her Nicety:

have Power to di&s;&s;olve even a Vow or Promi&s;e of
hers, to marry or not to marry at all: But if your
Daughter is not willing to marry one you may like,
I do not think, you have the &s;ame Right of Com|mand;
for you might then command her to mar|ry
a Per&s;on &s;he may have an Abhorrence of, and
an Aver&s;ion to, which could not be; the very
Laws of Matrimony forbid it; &s;he could not repeat
the Office of Matrimony at her Marriage, <HI>viz.</HI> to
<HI>love</HI> and <HI>honour him:</HI> and to promi&s;e what &s;he knew
at the &s;ame Time would be impo&s;&s;ible for her to
perform, would be to perjure her&s;elf, (<HI>for the Marriage
Promi&s;e is a &s;olemn Oath</HI>) and to deceive her Hu&s;|band
in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Manner; neither of which

<P>Her Si&s;ter was now in as great a Fright as be|fore;

Father hurry and terrify his Children &s;o with his

<SP>

<P>That's becau&s;e you do not act like a Chri|&s;tian
Father; you make your &s;elf a Terror to your

<PB N="104" REF="111">
dare not &s;peak to you; why, what do you mean,

complete young Gentleman as any the Town
can produce, and every way unexceptionable;
nay &s;he own'd her&s;elf he was one &s;he could like
very well, and to have her affront him and her Fa|ther,
and to di&s;mi&s;s him of her own Head, with|out
con&s;ulting me, or &s;taying till I came to Town!
and this after five Weeks keeping him Company,
and when &s;he knew the Writings were drawing for
her Marriage-Settlement; is this a decent way of
treating a Father? I think you are <HI>free</HI> with me in|deed,
to take their Pares in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Brother, &s;uppo&s;e all this to be, ju&s;t
as you relate it, yet if the young People <HI>could not
hit it,</HI> do we not always, when we make Propo&s;als
one to another for our Children, make this Condi|tion,
<HI>viz. if the young People can agree?</HI> and do we
not put them together to talk with one another, on
purpo&s;e that they may be acquainted, and &s;ee whe|ther
they can like one another, or no?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Well,</HI> and &s;o did I: Has he not waited up|on
her Lady&s;hip, <HI>I tell you,</HI> five Weeks? was not
that Time enough to know, whether &s;he lik'd him,
or no?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Time enough to like or di&s;like, I grant it;
and &s;he tells you plainly, &s;he does not like, and
cannot marry him; what would you have? and as
to putting him off in your Ab&s;ence, &s;he &s;ays, &s;he
<PB N="105" REF="112">
told you her Mind po&s;itively, before you went out
of Town, and would have given you her Rea&s;ons
for it; but you treated her with &s;o little Temper,
that &s;he had no room to &s;peak; and at la&s;t told her
you would have none of her Rea&s;ons, but expect|ed
&s;he &s;hould have him; how do you an&s;wer that
<HI>pray?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>

however I gave her till my Return to con&s;ider of
it; what had &s;he to do to turn him off without my
Knowledge, and affront a Gentleman of his Qua|lity?
it's an In&s;ult upon her Father, and a Scandal
to the whole Family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's all an&s;wer'd by what I &s;aid before,
that &s;he told you po&s;itively, before you went out of
Town, &s;he would never have him, and indeed had
re&s;olv'd then, to &s;ee him no more? for what &s;hould
a young Woman keep a Man Company for, when &s;he
re&s;olves not to have him? whatever you may
think, Brother, it would not have been very hand|&s;ome
on her &s;ide; be&s;ides, I can a&s;&s;ure you, your
Daughters are none of tho&s;e Women, that do any
thing unbecoming.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, &s;he did keep him Company after it,
for all that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never but once, that &s;he might di&s;mi&s;s him
civilly, and that was meerly a Force of your own
upon her, becau&s;e your Pa&s;&s;ion with her, obliged
her to do that Work her&s;elf, which you ought to
have done for her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, &s;he's an undutiful, di&s;re&s;pectful Crea|ture

<P>You'll con&s;ider of that, Brother, when
your Pa&s;&s;ion is over.</P>

all your Family: is Pa&s;&s;ion a proper Weapon to
manage Children with, Brother?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>

is a Thing no Man can bear with Pa|tience.</P>

<P>But who &s;hall be Judge between you, Bro|ther?
for it's po&s;&s;ible you may be in the wrong as

between me and my Children?</P>

then, and not the Madman, as (<HI>I mu&s;t be plain with
you</HI>) I think you do now.</P>

no longer.</P>

<PB N="107" REF="114">
of &s;uch an Alliance in your Family; his E&s;tate, his

that they are an Honour to your Family;
their Mother in&s;till'd Principles of Virtue, Piety,

<P>Brother, <HI>let me be free with you;</HI> &s;he had two
bad Examples to let before them, where a want of

more of that: But the&s;e are all Digre&s;&s;ions. The

bring a Gentleman to court one of them, who,
with all the Advantages his Per&s;on and Circum|&s;tances
pre&s;ent, yet wants the main Thing, which
&s;he looks for in a Husband; and without which &s;he
declares &s;he will not marry, no not if a Peer of

&s;ome Opportunity to be better &s;atisfied in her main
Scruple about Religion, and that &s;he might have
got it over: But on the contrary, he made &s;uch
<PB N="114" REF="121">
an open Declaration of his Contempt of all Reli|gion,
and his perfect Ignorance of any thing about
it, that I could not but wonder at it; &s;ure he mu&s;t
think we were a Family of Athei&s;ts, or el&s;e he
did it to affront her, for he could never think it
could be agreeable to any of us; and upon this
&s;he made the &s;ame open Declaration to him, that
&s;he could never think of joyning her&s;elf to a Man
&s;o perfectly void of Principles; and &s;o they parted
as it were by Agreement.</P>

corodes the Spirits, &s;tagnates the very Sen&s;es, and

when it came within a certain &s;pace of the Heart,
it had two Ways to go; if it a a&s;cended, it quitted
the hypocondriack Ve&s;&s;els, and &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the

to tell her Father, how ill &s;he was, and that &s;he
thought the Country might divert her a little, but
that if he de&s;ired her to come Home, &s;he would
return whenever he plea&s;ed: Her elde&s;t Si&s;ter did
&s;o, but all the An&s;wer &s;he got was, <HI>&s;he might &s;tay
there for ever, if &s;he would, he never de&s;ired to be troubled

<HEAD>DIALOGUE IV.</HEAD>
<P>_THE former Dialogue having put an End
to &s;he Court&s;hip between the Gentle|man
and his Mi&s;tre&s;s for the pre&s;ent,
and there being &s;ome Interval of Time
between tho&s;e Things and the remaining Part of
the Story, that Interval is filled up with another
little Affair in the &s;ame Family, of &s;till a nicer
Nature than the other, tho' not carried &s;o far.</P>
<P>The Father had frequently di&s;cour&s;ed the&s;e
Things with his elde&s;t Daughter in the Ca&s;e of her
Si&s;ter, as is to be &s;een in the la&s;t Dialogue, and
found by her Di&s;conr&s;e that &s;he was pretty much
of her Si&s;ter's Opinion in the Matter of choo&s;ing
a Husband; But having a Gentleman in his Thoughts
for her, who had the Character of a very &s;ober;
religious Per&s;on, he made no Que&s;tion but he
&s;hould di&s;po&s;e this Daughter both to her Satisfaction
and his own.</P>
<P>It was with a View to this De&s;ign that he had
je&s;ed with her in one; of then la&s;t di&s;cour&s;e, that
he had a religious Husband in &s;tore for her, and
that he hop'd he &s;hould give her no Occa&s;ion to
play the Fool as her Si&s;ter had done.</P>
<P>In the Con&s;equence of this he took Occa&s;ion to
tell her one Evening after Supper, that what he
had &s;poken in a way of Je&s;t to her at &s;uch a Time,
was really no Je&s;t in his own Thoughts; that he
had been &s;poken to by a certain Gentleman, a con|&s;iderable
<PB N="130" REF="137">
Merchant in the City, who&s;e elde&s;t Son
had an Inclination to pay his Re&s;pects to her; and
<HI>I a&s;&s;ure you, my Dear,</HI> &s;ays her Father, <HI>he has the Cha|racter
of a very &s;ober, religious Gentleman,</HI> and I am
&s;ure his Father and Mother are very good People;
indeed the whole Family are noted for a religious
Family, and I know no Family in the whole City
that have a better Character.</P>
<P>She made him no An&s;wer at all, till he began
with her again, <HI>Why are you &s;o &s;ilent, Child,</HI> &s;aid her
Father? Have you nothing to &s;ay? Methinks when
I look back upon the Di&s;order which the Ob&s;tinacy
of your Si&s;ter has put us all in, I would be glad to
have every Difficulty removed before-hand with you,
and therefore I &s;peak early, that if you have
any Objections, I may hear them, and not be dri|ven
a&s;teawards to ask People Pardon, for ill U&s;age
which I have had no hand in; and I would have
you u&s;e your Freedom now, that I may take no|thing
ill from you afterwards: And thus he pre&s;s'd
her to &s;peak.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daughter.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am in no ha&s;te, Sir, to marry; the
Times terrify me; the Education, the Manner,
the Conduct of Gentlemen is now &s;o univer&s;ally
loo&s;e, that I think for a young Woman to marry,
is like a Hor&s;e ru&s;hing into the Battel; I have no
Courage &s;o much as to think of it.</P>

wicked.</P>

<P>Sir, it is tho&s;e civilized People which I &s;peak
of; for even tho&s;e who now pa&s;s for &s;ober, are not
like what it was formerly; when you look narrow|ly
among them, as there are in the Gro&s;s ten Rakes
to one &s;ober Man, &s;o among the &s;ober. Men that
<PB N="131" REF="138">
are called civiliz'd Men, and who&s;e Morals will
bear any Character, there are ten Athei&s;ts to one
religious Man; and, <HI>which is wor&s;e than all the re&s;t,</HI>
if a Woman finds a religious Man, it is three to one
again, whether he agrees with her in Principles;
and &s;o &s;he is in danger of being undone even in the
be&s;t.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never heard the like! why what are my

<SP>

<P>I think, Sir, I ought to nave a negative Voice,
without being obliged to di&s;pute my Rea&s;ons with
my Father, for that's ju&s;t bringing me into the
&s;ame Condition with my Si&s;ter; her Rea&s;ons are
good to her, but not to you, Sir; and &s;o you take
her Con&s;cience of Duty to God to be a Contempt

<PB N="133" REF="140">
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I think when you propo&s;e marrying to
me, the Di&s;cour&s;e of Portion and Settlement is in
your Province, and I have nothing to do with it;
but I think I ought to be at Liberty to like or di&s;like
receive or refu&s;e the Per&s;on, and that ab&s;blutely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>What without &s;hewing any Rea&s;on?</P>

<P>No; I ought, without doubt, to tell my

all the Arguments my Father may u&s;e to &s;atisfie my

<P>And you capitulate with me for this Liberty
before you &s;ee this Gentleman, do you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir, I do not capitulate with you, but
I hope you will of your own accord grant me the
Liberty which the Nature of the Thing calls for;
that if I mu&s;t &s;ee the Gentleman, I may have the
Freedom to take or refu&s;e, if not there is no need
to &s;ee him, I may be given by a Contract, and
marry'd by Proxy, as the great People (Fools I

<P>I can have no Objection to a Man I never

ever &s;o inviting; I need not give Rea&s;ons
for this, Sir, what I have &s;aid, what my Si&s;ter and
my Aunts have &s;aid on that Account is enough; but
it is my Misfortune, Sir, to have another Scruple
beyond all that, and which the Ca&s;e of my Si&s;ter
gave no Occa&s;ion to mention.</P>

<P>Tho' her Father &s;eemed to give it over thus in
Di&s;cour&s;e with his Daughter, yet he had gone far|ther
with the Gentleman that made the Propo&s;al,
than he had told her, and had invited the Fa|ther
and Mother to Dinner the next Day, with an
intent that they &s;hould &s;ee and be acquainted with
his Daughters, &s;uppo&s;ing, at the &s;ame time, that
they would bring the young Gentleman with them.</P>
<P>They came to Dinner accordingly; but as the Fa|ther
knew well enough, that the Education of their
Son was a differing Way from that of his Daughters,
and that &s;he had declared her&s;elf &s;o po&s;itively in
that Part, he had de&s;ired them privately, not to
bring Their Son to Dinner: When they were come
and before his Daughter was call'd in, the Father
told them how the Ca&s;e &s;tood between him and
his elde&s;t Daughter, and that he &s;aw no Remedy
but this, that as he had not cold her any thing of
the De&s;ign, of this Invitation, or that they were
the Family he had de&s;igned her a Husband out of,
&s;o if they thought fit to turn their Eyes to his &s;e|cond
<PB N="137" REF="144">
Daughter, he was in hopes &s;he would have
more Wit than to run into the ridiculous Scruples
of the elde&s;t: They presently agreed, that it was
not at all reasonable to force the Inclination of the
young Lady; that they &s;aw no room to bring the
Opinions in Religion together, in their Children,
their Opinions at that Time differing extremely,
and their Son being as po&s;itive, they believed, as
his Daughter; &s;o they laid, with all their Hearts,
if their Son could fancy their &s;econd Daughter as
well, it &s;hould be the &s;ame thing to them: How|ever
the Mother of the young Gentleman ask'd
him if he would give her Leave to enter into Di&s;|cour&s;e
with his Daughter upon the Subject of her
Scruples; he told her with all his Heart, for he
would be glad to have her change her Mind; be|cau&s;e
as on the one hand he &s;hould be very well &s;a|tisfy'd
to bring them together, &s;o he really thought
her Notions were empty and &s;imple, and &s;hould be
glad &s;he was made wi&s;er; but then, Madam, <HI>&s;ays
he,</HI> you mu&s;t not discover the real De&s;ign, for if
you do, &s;he will be backward to &s;peak freely; &s;he
agreed to that, and &s;o this private Di&s;cour&s;e ended,
and his Daughters being introduced, and the u&s;ual
Ceremonies pa&s;s'd, they went to Dinner, the
young Ladies knowing nothing of the De&s;ign of
their being invited.</P>
<P>The Father and Mother were charm'd at the
Conduct of the young Woman; her Per&s;on and
Manner; the Mode&s;ty of her Behaviour, and a|bove
all, the Politene&s;s and Pertinence of her Di&s;|cour&s;e;
and &s;omething happening to be &s;aid about
marrying, the Father falls to rallying his Daughters
upon their Nicety in that Point; that nothing would
&s;erve them but religious Men: There's my Daughter
&mdash;<HI>&s;ays he,</HI> (pointing to his younge&s;t) I think
nothing will do for her but a Par&s;on; &s;he refu&s;ed a
<PB N="138" REF="145">
Gentleman of 2000 <HI>l.</HI> a year t'other Day, becau&s;e
he was not religious enough for her.</P>
<P>No, Madam, &s;ays his daughter, my Father
means, becau&s;e he had <HI>no Religion at all;</HI> hardly &s;o
much as a Coach-hor&s;e; for a Goach-horfe often
knows the way to the Church-door.</P>
<P>That alters the Ca&s;e quite, &s;aid Madam: Why,
Sir, &s;ays &s;he, you would not have married your
Daughter to a Brute! A Man without Religion is
a wor&s;e Bruce than a Hor&s;e! for the Hor&s;e obeys
the Dictates of Nature, but an Athei&s;t acts again&s;t
Rea&s;on, Nature and common Sen&s;e: I would not
marry a Child of mine to a Man of no Religion, if
he had ten thou&s;and Pound a year.</P>
<P>Well, &s;ays he, there's my Daughter&mdash;(point|ing
to his elde&s;t) &s;he goes farther; &s;he is not &s;ati&s;|fy'd
with a religious Husband, but &s;he mu&s;t have
one of her own Opinion in Religion, that goes to
Church where &s;he goes to Church, and wor&s;hips
ju&s;t as &s;he wor&s;hips; I don't think &s;he will ever be
plea&s;ed while &s;he lives.</P>
<P>Madam, &s;ays the elde&s;t, I expected my Father
would be upon my Bones next: My Father talks
of my Opinion, as if I was &s;omething that no bo|dy
el&s;e is; as if I was one of the new Prophets, or
of &s;ome &s;trange &s;ingular Opinion, &s;omething mon|&s;trous
in Religion; <HI>all I &s;ay</HI> is, that as I profe&s;s nothing
but what <HI>I think</HI> is light, and what thou&s;ands agree
with me in: if ever I do marry, <HI>as I &s;uppo&s;e I never
&s;hall,</HI> why &s;hould I not choo&s;e to have my Husband
and I of the &s;ame Opinion, that we may &s;erve God
together.</P>
<P>Madam, &s;ays the old Lady, your Father does
but je&s;t with you; he can never oppo&s;e &s;o rea&s;on|able
a thing as that; I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I think it is
much to be de&s;ired; I will not &s;ay, but there is a
<PB N="139" REF="146">
Po&s;&s;ibility of doing well without it; it may not be
a Sin, but I own, it is better if it can be &s;o.</P>
<P>I am &s;ure 'twould be a Sin in me, <HI>&s;ays the Daugh|ter,</HI>
becau&s;e it would be again&s;t my Conscience.</P>
<P>Nay, Madam, <HI>&s;ays the other,</HI> that's true; and you
are very much in the right to in&s;i&s;t upon it, if it
be &s;o; and no doubt your Father will be far from
offering; any thing that may &s;eem to be a Violence
upon your Conscience.</P>
<P>I offer Violence, Madam! <HI>&s;ays the Father,</HI> nay, they
are above that, they take upon them to &s;ay, I
will, and I won't, to their Father; I a&s;&s;ure you they
are pa&s;t my offering Violence to them.</P>
<P>In nothing, Madam, but this crabbed Bu&s;ine&s;s
of marrying, <HI>&s;ays the Daughter,</HI> and there indeed we
do take &s;ome Liberty with my Father.</P>
<P>Well Sir, &s;ays the old Lady, you mu&s;t allow Li|berty
there; Marriage is a Ca&s;e for Life, and mu&s;t
be well con&s;ider'd; and the young Ladies are to
bear it, fall it how it will, you know,, <HI>for better or
wor&s;e;</HI> they had need be allowed &s;ome Liberty there.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, Madam, &s;ays the younge&s;t, all the Li|berty
we cake is in Negatives only; we don't offer
to take any body that my Father don't like, only
we don't care to take &s;uch as we don't like our
&s;elves.</P>
<P>The old Gentleman then put in; upon my Word,
Sir, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I think your Daughters are in the right;
for certainly, tho' we may refu&s;e to let them marry
where they may choo&s;e, yet I can't think we &s;hould
deny them the Liberty to refu&s;e what we may offer,
or el&s;e we may as well give them in Marriage, as
was done in old Days, and never let them &s;ee one
another.</P>
<P>The elde&s;t Si&s;ter turn'd her Head towards her
Father at this, but &s;aid nothing.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="147">
I under&s;tand you, <HI>Betty,</HI> &s;ays her Father; but
&s;he &s;aid nothing &s;till; and the old Lady, finding
the Di&s;cour&s;e pinch'd a little hard, begun &s;ome o|ther
Talk, and &s;oon after, the Men withdrawing,
left the Ladies together.</P>
<P>When the Men were gone; Hark ye, &s;ays the
old Gentlewoman, I was willing to break off the
Di&s;cour&s;e ju&s;t now, becau&s;e I was afraid it was of|fen&s;ive
to your Father, but pray let me talk a little
more to you; I fully approve the Re&s;olution of
your younge&s;t Si&s;ter, but methinks yours is a little
uncharitable, <HI>&s;peaking to the eld&s;t.</HI></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was very much obliged to you Ma|dam,
for breaking off the Di&s;cour&s;e, for my Father
is pa&s;&s;ionate, and is &s;ometimes &s;o out of Temper
with us upon tho&s;e Points, that we are greatly
grieved at it, and particularly that he will not give
us Leave to &s;peak.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very &s;orry for it; for indeed I
think yours is nothing but what every Woman that
is a Chri&s;tian ought to think her&s;elf obliged to;
what dreadful Doings mu&s;t there be, when a reli|gious
Woman marries a Wretch that is a De&s;pi&s;er
of God? a Chri&s;tian to be link'd to an Infidel!
one that &s;erves God to be joyn'd to one of God's
Enemies! and then to love &s;uch a Man too! The very
Thought is enough to fill one with Cunfu&s;ion!
Take it which way you will, it is equally di&s;mal.
<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> To be marry'd to him and <HI>not love</HI> him, that's
a Hell upon Earth! and to love him! one that we
mu&s;t reflect on as a Limb of the Devil! a Son of
Perdition! to embrace one that God abhors? to
have the Affections bound to one that God hates!
what Contradictions are the&s;e! what Horror mu&s;t
fill the Soul while they live! and what dreadful
<PB N="141" REF="148">
Thoughts mu&s;t crowd into ones Mind, if &s;uch a
Man &s;hould come to die before us! Dear young
Lady, &s;ays &s;he, you are happy that you could de|fend
your &s;elf again&s;t &s;uch a Propo&s;al.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Madam, your Charge upon me
is a lirtle hard: I think the Arguments are as &s;trong
almo&s;t in my Part as my Si&s;ter's, tho' they are of
another Nature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old La.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I can't &s;ay &s;o, Madam: it is true,
there is &s;omething to be &s;aid in your Ca&s;e, but no|thing
&s;o e&s;&s;ential as in the other; and, as I &s;aid,
methinks it looks as if you wanted Charity: I hope,
Child, you do not think all Opinions but your own
are fatal to be profe&s;s'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Madam, not at all; I hope there
are good People of all Per&s;ua&s;ions; but if I did
not think my own be&s;t, how could I an&s;wer the
cleaving to it my &s;elf?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old La.</SPEAKER>
<P>So far you are right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, Madam, tho' in Charity I ought
to allow others to be good Chri&s;tians, and that I
&s;hould, and do keep up a friendly Correspondence
with them who di&s;&s;ent from my Judgment in reli|gious
Matters, yet there is a great deal of Diffe|rence
between Charity to them, and Union with
them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old La.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have &s;tudied the Point thoroughly I
perceives; I under&s;tand you perfectly; pray go on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, in Di&s;cour&s;e with my Father,
I could never u&s;e my Freedom, or obtain Leave to
propo&s;e my Scruples, with the Rea&s;ons of them;
but I hope you will allow me Liberty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old La.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my Heart, Madam, for I am
glad to enter into &s;o curious a Debate with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Religion, Madam, without Doors <HI>is
one thing,</HI> Religion within Doors <HI>is another:</HI> in the
Town among my Acquaintance, and in the Neigh|bourhood,
<PB N="142" REF="149">
a due Charity to every one is what I
think the Chri&s;tian Principle calls for, and I con|ver&s;e
freely with good People of every Opinion,
extending Charity to all <HI>in lowline&s;s of Mind, e&s;teeming
every one better than my &s;ef:</HI> But <HI>within doors the Ca&s;e
alters;</HI> Family-Religion is a &s;ociable Thing, and God
&s;hould be wor&s;hip'd there with one Heart, and with
one Voice; there can be no Separation there with|out
a dreadful Breach both of Charity and Duty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old La.</SPEAKER>
<P>You &s;tart a new Thing to me indeed, and
it is &s;omewhat &s;urprizing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be true, Madam that there
may be divers Opinions in a Nation, without breach
of Charity, but I believe it is impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould
be &s;o in a Family,, without breach of Affection:
what Union, what Onene&s;s of De&s;ires, what per|fect
Agreement (without which a Man and Wife
can never be &s;aid to di&s;charge the Duty of the Re|lation)
can there be, where there is a diver&s;ity of
Wor&s;hip, a cla&s;hing of <HI>Opinions,</HI> and an Oppo&s;i|tion
of Principles?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old La.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Child, you carry it too high; if
they differ <HI>in Principles</HI> indeed, there is &s;omething
to be &s;aid; but we are talking of a Difference in
Opinion only, where the Fundamentals may be the
&s;ame.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, I recall the Word <HI>Principles</HI>
then, and joyn with you to confine it to <HI>Opinion</HI>
only; But 'tis the &s;ame thing; the Union can never
be perfect, while the differing Sentiments of things
leave room for Di&s;putes between them: For Ex|ample,
Madam; the differing Forms of Wor&s;hip;
one will pray by a Book only, the other without
a Book wholly; this is as light a Difference as can
be &s;poken of: But how &s;hall God be wot&s;hip'd with
the united Voice and Affections of the whole Fa|mily
even in this Ca&s;e? what Helps will two &s;uch
<PB N="143" REF="150">
Relations be to one another, in praying to God ei|ther
by them&s;elves or with their Families?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my Word you &s;en&s;ibly affect me
now with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not enough, Madam, that they
being &s;incerely religious a part, and &s;hall wor&s;hip God
in their own &s;eparate Way, tho' better &s;o than not
at all; but the Zeal, the Affection, the uniting
their Hearts in their Wor&s;hip, their praying with
and for one another; this alas! is all lo&s;t: Then &s;ay
it be in the publick Wor&s;hip, there they make a wo|ful
Separation; God, that has made them one, is
&s;erv'd by them as two; God has joyn'd them to|gether,
and they part a&s;under in their &s;erving him;
God has made them one, and yet they cannot wor|&s;hip
him as one; how does this con&s;i&s;t, Madam?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old La.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;ee you are full of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>In their publick Wor&s;hip, Sacraments
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> neither one Heart or one Voice goes with
their Wor&s;hip: Tho' they communicate in the &s;ame
Ordinance, they &s;et up two Altars; one wor&s;hips
here, and one there; and tho' their Faces are both
&s;et Heaven-wards, perhaps they turn back to back
as &s;oon as they go out of then Doors co the pub|lick
Wor&s;hip of God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old La.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are very clear in it indeed, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is nor all, Madam; there are &s;e|veral
Family Circum&s;tances be&s;ides the&s;e, which
make a Union of Opinion ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary:
As fir&s;t, Family-Wor&s;hip, a Thing without which
Families, however privately and &s;eparately devout,
are coupled with Heathens, Jer. x, 25. <HI>Pour ouact thy
Wrath upon the Heathen, and upon the Families which
call not upon thy Name:</HI> Whatever there may be in
publick Wor&s;hip, there &s;hould always be an exact
Harmony in private; and how can this be, where
either of them di&s;tents tram the Manner? if there
<PB N="144" REF="151">
is a Di&s;cord in the Manner, there can beno Con|cord
in the Performance, no Union in the Affe|ctions;
in a Word their <HI>Prayers will be hindred,</HI> and
who would be thus unequally yoked?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old La.</SPEAKER>
<P>I expected you would name that Scrip|ture,
tho' it is certain that was &s;poken principally
to tho&s;e who married with Unbelievers, which is a
different Ca&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Madam, but to come to another
Ca&s;e: Suppo&s;e the Husband and Wife we are &s;peak|ing
of have Children, what Foundation of Eter|nal
Schi&s;m is there in the Family? &s;ome of the
Children adhere to the Father, &s;ome to the Mo|ther;
&s;ome wor&s;hip <HI>in this Mount,</HI> and &s;ome no
where <HI>but at Jeru&s;alem;</HI> &s;ome go with the Father,
&s;ome with the Mother; &s;ome kneel down with
the Father, &s;ome with the Mother; till, as they
grow up, they really learn not to kneel down at
all: Family-Education, united In&s;truction, Cau|tion,
Example, they are all dreadfully mangled
and divided, till in the End they come to nothing;
and the Children grow our of Government, pa&s;t
In&s;truction, and are all lo&s;t. The&s;e, Madam, are
&s;ome of the Rea&s;ons I would have given my Father
(if he would have had Patience with me;) why in
his late Propo&s;al he &s;aid he had to make, I de&s;ired
that I might be at Liberty to choo&s;e by my own
Principles, and not at random, as too many do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old La.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Madam, do you not allow, that if
both Parties are &s;incerely pious and religious, they
may make Allowances to one another, and make
Con&s;cience of hindring and pulling back one ano|ther
in the Duties of Religion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, Madam, as to that, two Things
offer to my View, for I have often con&s;idered
them both: Fir&s;t, The more &s;incere in Religion
either of them are, the more fixt in Principle and
<PB N="145" REF="152">
Opinion, it is likely they will be, and the farther
from making Abatements to one another; and e&s;|pecially,
Secondly, In the great Article of educa|ting
and in&s;tructing their Children; for what ten|der
Mother, that having fixt her Opinion, as &s;he
thinks, in the belt Manner and Way, could bea$
not to have her Children brought up in the &s;ame
Sentiments of Religion, which &s;he thinks mo&s;t
agreeable to the revealed Will of God? and the
more con&s;ciencious and religious &s;he was, the more
&s;teadily &s;he would cleave to it as her Duty; and
the like of the Man: So that here would be a con|&s;tant
Heart-burning and Unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, Madam, I think your Rea&s;ons good,
and you guard them &s;o well with &s;uch &s;elf-evi|dent
Conclu&s;ions, that I cannot think your Father
can de&s;ire you to break thro' them: If you think it
will be for your Service, I'll mention it again to
him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you do, Madam, I de&s;ire to be ab|&s;ent;
for he will not bear it from me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me alone for that.</P>
</SP>
<P>When the old Lady had done this Conversation,
&s;he began to call for her Husband and the Father;
&s;o the young Ladies withdrew: When &s;he was
come to them, &s;he applied her&s;elf to the Father
and her Husband in a few Words.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my Word, <HI>&s;ays &s;he to her Husband,</HI> this
young Lady has more Religion in her than all of
us, and a clearer Sight into the particular Parts of a
religious Life, than any that ever I met With before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, &s;ays the Father, have you had a
Battle with my Betty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="146" REF="153">
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, upon my Word, we have had no Bat|tel;
I have not been able to open my Mouth a|gain&s;t
one Word &s;he &s;ays; &s;he is able to run down
a whole Society of Doctors in the&s;e Points; I am a
perfect Convert to all &s;he &s;ays, and tho' I wi&s;h from
my Soul my Son had &s;uch a Wife, yet I would not
for the World they &s;hould come together at the
Price of putting the lea&s;t Violence upon &s;uch no|ble
Principles, &s;o &s;olidly e&s;tabli&s;h'd, and &s;o firmly
adher'd to; and I defy all Mankind to confute her.</P>

<P>You prompt my Curio&s;ity; I wi&s;h you
could tell us a little of the Story.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>A little! I can ea&s;ily repeat it to you; 'tis
impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould forget it: But it may be you,

<SP>

<P>Yes, yes; I would very willingly hear it,

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hu&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never heard any thing more &s;olid, and
intimating a thorough Sen&s;e of Religion in
my Life; I wi&s;h my Son and &s;he were both of the
&s;ame Opinion then; for a Woman of &s;uch Prin|ciples
can never be fatally mi&s;taken in Opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confe&s;s I would never give her Opportu|nity
to explain her &s;elf thus with me; but I a&s;|&s;ure
you I am &s;o mov'd with it, that I will never
offer to impo&s;e upon her again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you &s;ee, Sir, it was an Error to be
&s;o angry with your Child, as not to hear her; I
fear you have done &s;o with both of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly I have; but I &s;ee now I have been
wrong to them both; and indeed more to my
younge&s;t Daughter, than to my elde&s;t; for &s;he
<PB N="147" REF="154">
refu&s;ed the Gentleman becau&s;e he really had no
Religion at all, and yet I was in a violent Pa&s;&s;ion
with her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, that was hard indeed; for if there
be all this to be &s;aid, why a Woman &s;hould not
marry a Man of a different Opinion in Religion,
there mu&s;t be much more to be &s;aid why &s;he &s;hould
not marry one that de&s;pi&s;es Religion; and this in|deed
I &s;aid to your younge&s;t Daughter, applauding
her Conduct, tho' I did not know that you had
u&s;ed her hardly on that Account.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Madam, you are right, the thing
is &s;o indeed; but he was a pretty Gentleman, and
had a very noble E&s;tate, and I was mightily pleas'd
with the Thoughts of the Match, and that made
me more pa&s;&s;ionate with the Child, than I &s;hould

<P>But how came &s;he to know he was &s;uch a

<P>Truly, his own Folly too; he told her &s;o
directly, in &s;o many Words; own'd he had not trou|bled
his Head about Religion, and did not intend
it; made a Banter and Je&s;t of Religion in
general; told her, it was a Road he had never
travel'd, and that he intended to choo&s;e a Wife fir&s;t,
and then pehaps he might choo&s;e his Religion.</P>

<P>as to the la&s;t; he not only profe&s;t a great

my elde&s;t for him) and made her the particular
Mi&s;tre&s;s of his Choice; and I verily believe lov'd

<P>Upon this Foot the Di&s;cour&s;e ended for that
Time, and all Thoughts of the Match for the eld|e&s;t
Daughter with the Son of that Gentlewoman
being laid a&s;ide for the pre&s;ent, the old Lady, at
parting, in a very, friendly Manner invited the
young Ladies to her Hou&s;e, and they promi&s;ed to
come, and the Father &s;aid aloud he would come
and bring them.</P>
<P>It was not long before the young Ladies put
their Father in mind of his Appointment; for be|ing
mightily plea&s;ed with the old Gentlewoman,
they had a great Mind to pay the Vi&s;it, that the
Acquaintance might be &s;ettled. Their Father ap|pointed
<PB N="150" REF="157">
the next Day, but being interrupted ju&s;t
at the Time he intended to go, he cau&s;ed them to
go without him and &s;end the Coach back for him
to come after them when his Bu&s;ine&s;s was done.</P>
<P>While they were here, the good old Gentlewo|man,
who entertained them with great Civility,
diverted them with every thing &s;he could think of;
and after abundance of other u&s;eful Chat, they
fell to talking the old Stories over again, about
religious Husbands, and the Nece&s;&s;ity there was to
have both Husband and Wife joyn their Endea|vours
to propagating Family - Religion: The
younge&s;t Daughter repeated her Mother's Maxim;
Madam, &s;ays &s;he, it was a Rule my Mother gave
us at her Death, and which I &s;ee &s;o much Weight
in, that I de&s;ire to make it the Foundation, upon
which I would build all my Pro&s;pects of Happi|ne&s;s,
<HI>'viz.</HI> That a religious Life is the only Heaven upon
<HI>Earth:</HI> I have added &s;ome other things to it &s;ince,
which my own Observation directs me to, but
which I believe you will allow to be in their De|gree
ju&s;t &s;uch as the&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> That a religious Fa|mily
is one of the greate&s;t Comforts of a religious
Life, That where both Husband and Wife are not
mutually, at lea&s;t, if not equally religious, there
can never be a truly religious family; That there|fore
for a religiou&s;ly inclined Woman to marry an
irreligious Husband, is to entail Per&s;ecution upon
her&s;elf as long as &s;he lives. The old Lady reply'd,
I find, Madam, as young as you are, you have
&s;tudied this Point very well. Indeed, Madam,
<HI>&s;aid the eldest Si&s;ter,</HI> my Si&s;ter has had occa&s;ion for
it; for &s;he has been hard put to it, what with the
Offers of an extraordinary Match, my Father's
violent Pa&s;&s;ion, and, <HI>among our &s;elves, Madam,</HI> not
a little the Importunity of her own Affections,
that for my Parr, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I wonder &s;he has
<PB N="151" REF="158">
been able to &s;tand her Ground; They are three
powerful Arguments, I acknowledge, <HI>&s;aid the old
Lady,</HI> Pray, Madam, as far as it may be proper,
let me know &s;omething of the Manner; you need
not mention Per&s;ons; I am not inqui&s;itive on that
&s;core, I a&s;&s;ure you: If my Si&s;ter give me Leave,
Madam, &s;ays the elde&s;t, <HI>the younge&s;t &s;aid &s;he left her
at Liberty,</HI> Why then, Madam, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> My Fa|ther&mdash;<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Here &s;he gives her an Abridgement of the whole Sto|ry, but without the mo&s;t extravagant Part of her Fa|ther's Pa&s;&s;ion, that it might not reflect upon him.</NOTE></P>
<P>Well, Madam, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> I will not &s;ay all my
Thoughts on this &s;urprizing Story, becau&s;e your
Si&s;ter is here, for 'tis a Rule with me never to
prai&s;e any one to their Face, or reproach any
behind their Backs; but it is an extraordinary Sto|ry
indeed; and turning to the younge&s;t Si&s;ter, &s;he
&s;aid to her very &s;eriou&s;ly, <HI>I pray God fortify you,</HI> Child,
<HI>in &s;uch Re&s;olutions,</HI> and <HI>grant that you may have the
true End of them fully an&s;wer'd; that if ever you do
marry, it may be to a Man as uncommonly &s;erious, pious
and &s;incere as you have been inimitably re&s;olute in refu&s;ing
&s;uch great Offers, for the Want of it.</HI> Then turning to
her elde&s;t Si&s;ter, &s;ay &s;he, This &s;urprizing Story puts
me in mind of a Story which a very good Man and
an old Acquaintance of ours told me the o|ther
Day, and which they &s;ay has ju&s;t now hap|pen'd
to a young Gentleman that he knows in the
Country, it's a pretty way off too, but he told us
his Name, I believe my Husband knows the Name,
and I tell you the Story for your Si&s;ter's Encou|ragement;
who knows, but &s;he may be a means
by &s;uch unexampled Conduct as this of hers is, to
<PB N="152" REF="159">
bring the Gentleman &s;he has had upon her Hands
to &s;ome Sen&s;e of his Condition.</P>
<P>There is a Gentleman in that Country of a very
good Family; and of a very great E&s;tate, but
young, and a Batchelor I think he &s;aid; he is not
above &s;ix and twenty, and has between two and
three thou&s;and, a year, a mo&s;t accompli&s;h'd well|bred
Man, a hand&s;ome charming Per&s;on, and
every thing that could be &s;aid of a Man, to &s;et him
out, he &s;aid of him: He had indeed been of a Fa|mily,
<HI>he &s;aid</HI> that had been eminently wicked, &s;o
that the very Name of Religion had &s;carce been
heard of among them for &s;ome Ages; and <HI>young
Ma&s;ter,</HI> &s;aid my Friend, could not well be &s;aid to
be wor&s;e than his Father and Grandfather, that
went before him.</P>
<P>However it happen'd, it &s;eems that he went to
<HI>London, I think,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>my Friend &s;aid 'twas last
Winter,</HI> and when he came back he was &s;trangely
melancholy and dejected, and quite alter'd in his
Conver&s;ation; in&s;tead of riding abroad and vi&s;it|ing
the Gentlemen, and receiving Vi&s;its from them,
he &s;hun'd all Company, walk'd about his Gardens
and Woods all alone till very late in the Night,
and all his Servants wonder'd what ailed him; that
one Night they were in a great Fright for him,
knowing he was out on Foot, and alone; when,
about ten a Clock at Night he came in with a poor
hone&s;t Country Fellow with him, that liv'd almo&s;t
three Mile off; that the next Day he took that
poor Man home to his Hou&s;e, and &s;ent for his
Wife and Children, who all liv'd in a poor Cot|tage
on the Wa&s;te, and provided for them; gave
the poor Man a Farm Rent free for twelve Years,
which always went for 22 <HI>l.</HI> a year, with a good
Hou&s;e, and lent him a Stock for manuring it too,
and, made Him Bailiff of the Manor; and in &s;hort,
<PB N="153" REF="160">
made a Man of him: Whereupon every body &s;aid,
that the E&s;quire had been in &s;ome great Danger or
other, and the poor Man had &s;aved his Life; and
when &s;ome body happen'd to &s;ay as much to him
one Day, he an&s;wer'd <HI>yes,</HI> that poor Man had done
more than &s;aved his Life <HI>for he had &s;aved his Soul.</HI></P>
<P>It &s;eems this poor labouring Wretch, tho' mi&s;e|rable
to the la&s;t Degree, as to this World, was yet
known co be a mo&s;t religious &s;erious Chri&s;tian, and,
a very mode&s;t, humble, but knowing and &s;en&s;ible
Man, and he had been di&s;cour&s;ing good Things
with him, and from that time forward the poor
Man was &s;carce ever from him; that it was ob&s;erv'd
by &s;ome of the Servants, that the next Morning
after the poor Man came Home with him, he came
again and brought a Bible with him, which was left
in the young Gentleman's Chamber, and that this
poor Man and he were often lock'd up an Hour or
two together every Day; that next Market-Day
the poor Man went to the next Market Town upon
&s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s for the Gentleman, and brought
Home a new Bible, and &s;everal other religious
Books, and that his Ma&s;ter was continually reading
them; In &s;hort, our Friend tells us, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> that
he is become the mo&s;t &s;ober, religious Chri&s;tian,
that for a Man of his Fortune and Quality has ever
been heard of, and that he is admired by all the
Country for it.</P>
<P>I tell you this Story, Madam, turning to the
younge&s;t Si&s;ter, to confirm you in your Re&s;olution,
and to let you &s;ee, that there are &s;ome religious
Gentlemen in the World &s;till, and that the Gen|tlemen
may be a&s;hamed, when they pretend to &s;ay
Religion is below their Quality; for, <HI>my Friend &s;ays,</HI>
that this Gentleman is with his Religion al&s;o the
humble&s;t, &s;weete&s;t temper'd Creature in the World,
ready to do good Offices to the poore&s;t of the
<PB N="154" REF="161">
County, and yet mannerly and agreeably plea&s;ant
With the Greate&s;t, and his Family is a little Pattern
of Vertue to all round them.</P>
<P>Ay, Madam, <HI>&s;ays the elde&s;t,</HI> 'tis &s;uch a Gentle|man
my Si&s;ter would have: But, <HI>&s;ays her Si&s;ter,</HI>
where are they to be found? I never expect it:
Pray, Madam, &s;ays the elde&s;t Si&s;ter, in what Part
of the World does this <HI>Black Swan,</HI> this unheard
of non&s;uch Thing of a Gentleman live? I really
forget the Place, Madam, <HI>&s;ays the old Lady,</HI> but 'tis
&s;omewhere in <HI>Hamp&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>She perceiv'd <HI>at that Word</HI> both the young Ladies
chang'd a little, and look'd at one another; &s;o &s;he
turn'd her Di&s;cour&s;e off to &s;ome other Subject, and
left them in the dark as to the Name of the Gen|tleman;
for &s;he perceived they both gue&s;s'd at it,
or &s;u&s;pected it.</P>
<P>When they had taken their Leave, and the two
Si&s;ters were in the Coach coming Home, <HI>&s;ays the
elde&s;t Si&s;ter to the other,</HI> Did you ob&s;erve Mrs, B&mdash;s
Story of the Gentleman in <HI>Hamp&s;haire?</HI> Yes; &s;aid
the other, I did; and I believe you fancy 'tis the
&s;ame Per&s;on. we know of: It's very true, <HI>&s;ays the
eldest,</HI> I did think &s;o all the while &s;he was telling
the Story; and I expected &s;he would name him,
but I was loth to ask her his Name: I am glad you
didn't, <HI>&s;ays the other,</HI> for I know no Good it can be
to me, to hear it one way or other now he is gone.
Why would not you be glad to know that he was
really &s;uch a one as &s;he has de&s;cribed, <HI>&s;ays the elde&s;t?</HI>
Yes truly for his own Sake I &s;hould, <HI>&s;aid her Si&s;ter;</HI>
but 'tis nothing to me now; I had rather never
have him mention'd at all to me, upon any Occa|&s;ion
whatever.</P>
<P>After they were come Home, their Father, who
being engaged all the while, had &s;ent the Coach
back for them, with an Excu&s;e for his not coming,
<PB N="155" REF="162">
was very inqui&s;itive to know of them what Di&s;|cour&s;e
they had had, and his elde&s;t Daughter telling
him one Story and another Story, he would cry,
<HI>Well, was that all?</HI> for he expected &s;he had broke
the Thing to them: No, &s;ays the elde&s;t, &s;he told
us a &s;trange Story in Hamp&s;hire; and with that re|peated
the Pa&s;&s;age above Word for Word. Her
Father took no notice of it at that Time, but two
or three Days after, as they were at Supper, he
&s;ays to his elde&s;t Daughter, <HI>Betty,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>Who do
you think the Gentleman in</HI> Hamp&s;hire <HI>is, that Mrs.
B&mdash;told you the Story of?</HI> I cannot tell, &s;ays &s;he;
Pray who was it? Even as I thought when you
told of it, <HI>&s;aid her Father, for I had heard &s;omething of
it before;</HI> it's no body el&s;e but Mr.&mdash;the &s;ame
your wi&s;e Si&s;ter there thought fit to treat with &s;o
much ill Manners.</P>
<P>Nay, Sir, &s;ays the elde&s;t, do not &s;ay my Si&s;ter
treated him with <HI>ill Manners;</HI> for he owns the con|trary
to that <HI>him&s;elf;</HI> but how are you &s;ure of it,
Sir, that it is he? Why I have had the Story, <HI>&s;ays
her Father,</HI> from her Husband, who is greatly af|fected
with, and he named his Name to me, not
knowing in the lea&s;t that I knew any thing of him</P>
<P>Truly, <HI>&s;ays the eldest,</HI> I am very glad of it for
his Sake, but it does not &s;ignifie a Farthing to her
now; for if he was to come to her again to Mor|row,
with all his Sobriety and Reformation about
him, &s;he would have nothing to &s;ay to him.</P>
<P>Why &s;o, Child, <HI>&s;ays the Father?</HI> Did you not
own &s;he lov'd him? Yes, &s;ays the Daughter, be|fore
&s;he come to know what a Creature he was.
Well then, &s;ays her Father, if that be removed,
and he is become another Man, &s;he will love him
again; for &s;he had no other Objection again&s;t him,
had &s;he? No, Sir, &s;ays the Daughter, &s;he had no
other Objection, but &s;he will never believe him,
<PB N="156" REF="163">
let his Pretences to Religion be what they will$
Why &s;o, <HI>&s;ays the Father?</HI> Becau&s;e, Sir, he cold her
that if he had known her Mind, he would
have pretended a world of Reformation and Reli|gion,
and that he did not doubt but he could be
Hypocrite enough to cheat her.</P>
<P>Nay, if he has been &s;o fooli&s;h, I know not what
to &s;ay to it, &s;ays the Father; let it re&s;t as it is; if
&s;he will not have him, whether he be religious, or
not religious, then the Objection of his being not
religious, was a Sham and a Cloak, and &s;he &s;tands
out in meer Ob&s;tinacy again&s;t her own Intere&s;t,
purely to affront her Father; let her so on, till &s;he
comes to be convinced by her own Misfortune, I'll
meddle no more about it.</P>
<P>The elde&s;t Si&s;ter &s;ail'd not to relate this Story
very particularly to her Si&s;ter, who very gravely
mu&s;ing on the Particulars, an&s;wer'd her Si&s;ter thus,
after &s;everal other &s;ober and religious Expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Dear Si&s;ter, &s;ays &s;he, this Thing has been Af|fliction
enough to me, but my Father's Conduct
has always made it double; becau&s;e he cannot talk
of it without Re&s;entment and Unkindne&s;s: If it
be really &s;o, that this is the Gentleman Mrs. B&mdash;
told us the Story of Ye&s;terday, I &s;hould rejoyce;
nay, tho' I am loth to be cheated, and what he
&s;aid of playing the Hypocrite with me, has made
me the more backward to give Credit to Out&s;ides,
yet were I &s;ure it was a real Work of God in him,
and that he was become a religious Gentleman,
you know I have Affection enough to rejoyce on
my own Account, and to entertain him after an|other
Manner than before: But yet two Things
make it &s;till remote from me, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That I have no
Demon&s;tration of the Truth of the Fact: And,
<HI>Secondly,</HI> That if it is &s;o, he has made no Step to|wards
me, and perhaps never may; and you know,
<PB N="157" REF="164">
Si&s;ter, <HI>continued &s;he,</HI> 'tis no Bu&s;ine&s;s of mine till he
does.</P>
<P>Why that's true, <HI>&s;ays the eldest Si&s;ter,</HI> but what
mu&s;t be done then?</P>
<P>Done, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> let it alone; let it re&s;t, till we
hear &s;omething or other of it in the ordinary way
of &s;uch things.</P>
<P>But what mu&s;t we do with my Father? <HI>&s;ays the
eldest</HI> for for he is always talking to me about ic.</P>
<P>Do! <HI>&s;ays the other,</HI> give the &s;ame Anfwer to him
from me, as I do to you.</P>
<P>Then, <HI>&s;ays the eldest,</HI> I am &s;ure he will never re&s;t
till he brings it about again, for he is &s;trangely in|tent
upon it.</P>
<P>Let that be as plea&s;es God, I will be wholly
neuter, <HI>&s;ays the younge&s;t Si&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>Some time after this Di&s;cour&s;e, the Father, hav|ing
&s;ome occa&s;ion for his Health, went down to
the <HI>Bath,</HI> and taking all his Daughters with him,
they continued there &s;ome Months, in which Time
they contracted an intimate Acquaintance with a
Lady and her two Daughters, who came thither
from <HI>Hamp&s;hire:</HI> The old Lady had been a Widow
of a Gentleman of Quality, by whom &s;he had
had two Daughter, but was now married to an
eminent Clergyman in the Country where &s;he
liv'd; and they were all together at the <HI>Bath,</HI> and
lodg'd in the &s;ame Apartments with the&s;e Ladies.</P>
<P>It happen'd one Day after Dinner, talking free|ly
together about marrying religious Husbands and
Wives, the elde&s;t Daughter, as what is always
much upon the Mind, will be in. Proportion much
upon the Tongue, in&s;i&s;ted in Di&s;cour&s;e, upon the Mi|&s;ery
of unequal Matches, and how unhappy it was,
either to Husband or Wife, when a religious, pious
&s;incere Chri&s;tian, whether Man or Woman, was
married to another who had no Sen&s;e of Religion,
<PB N="158" REF="165">
and &s;he gives a long Account of a Relation of
their Father's, but without naming their Aunt, how
good a Husband &s;he had in all other Re&s;pects, how
comfortably and plea&s;antly they liv'd, but only for
that one Thing; and then &s;he told them (&s;till with|out
naming any Body) how many odd Tricks Sir
<HI>James</HI> &s;erv'd his Lady, and the like.</P>
<P>Well, Madam, <HI>&s;ays the old Clergyman,</HI> I can tell
you &s;uch a Story of a Lady in our County, as I
believe you never heard the like, I do not know
the Woman, <HI>&s;ays the Doctor,</HI> but I know the Gen|tleman
intimately well, and have had a great deal
of religious Conver&s;ation with him upon the Oc|ca&s;ion
I &s;hall tell you of.</P>
<P>He courted a young Lady, <HI>&s;ays the Dector,</HI> but
whether &s;he liv'd in our Country, or the City, or
Where, he is perfectly mute, only that he often
tells her Chri&s;tian Name; and &s;eeing he &s;eems re|&s;olved
to conceal her Per&s;on, no body will be &s;o
rude to pre&s;s him on that Head.</P>
<P>The Gentleman, <HI>&s;ays the Doctor,</HI> is of a very good
Family, has a noble E&s;tate, a comely Per&s;on, and
a compleat courtly Education, and till this happen'd,
was almo&s;t always at <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>His Mi&s;tre&s;s mu&s;t be little le&s;s than an Angel in
human Shape, by his De&s;crtption, but that we give
no heed to; for, Madam, <HI>&s;ays the old Doctor,</HI> you
know Men in Love give them&s;elves a Liberty that
way: But however, after all Things were agreed,
and the Writings drawing, it &s;eems, &s;he threw him
off intirely, and refu&s;ed him meerly becau&s;e &s;he
found he was a Man of no Religion.</P>
<P><HI>Says the elde&s;t Si&s;ter,</HI> How could &s;he know that,
Sir? he was not &s;o fooli&s;h to tell her &s;o him&s;elf, I
&s;uppo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="166">
Yes, <HI>&s;ays the Doctor,</HI> he did: Why then, <HI>&s;ays the
Si&s;ter,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e he was very indifferent whether
his had her or no. Indeed, <HI>&s;ays the Doctor,</HI> one
would think &s;o, <HI>and I &s;aid &s;o to him;</HI> but he told me
that it was &s;o far horn that, that he had taken up
his Re&s;olution never to have any other Woman, if
&s;he were the riche&s;t, be&s;t and mo&s;t beautiful Crea|ture
alive.</P>
<P>Then perhaps the Lady has a &s;uperiour Fortune
to him be&s;ides her other Qualifications, <HI>&s;ays the
Si&s;ter.</HI> No, ju&s;t the contrary, <HI>&s;ays the Doctor.</HI> But,
Mad m, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I'll tell you the Hi&s;tory of this
Gentleman, it it is net too long for you, 'tis a
Story cannot, be unprofitable to any one to hear,
e&s;pecially <HI>to you Ladies,</HI> who have taken up &s;uch
happy Re&s;olutions about marrying none but religi|ous
Husbands. <HI>The Ladies bow'd,</HI> in Token they
de&s;ired him to go on with his Story. <HI>So the Doctor
ment on.</HI></P>
<P>Nothing touch'd this Gentleman &s;o near, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI>
after be was gone from his Mi&s;rre&s;s, as to reflect
what kind of a Wretch or Mon&s;ter he was, that a
vertuous young Lady, and one who he had Rea&s;on
to believe had no di&s;like of him, &s;hould be afraid
to marry him for fear of being ruin'd, and that &s;he
&s;hould think if &s;he took him, &s;he declared War a|gain&s;t
Heaven, and renounc'd all Preten&s;ions of
Duty to her Maker&mdash;<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Here he related the whole Story, his Talk, with him|&s;elf, the Di&s;cour&s;e at the Chocolate hou&s;e, his Retreat into the Country, his happening to hear the poor Countryman at Prayer, his Conver&s;ation with him upon the Way, and
his Conduct afterward, all in the Manner as related be|fore;</NOTE></P>

We mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e the Si&s;ters to have <HI>much le&s;s</HI>

<P>But the elde&s;t Daughter, who, tho' perhaps her
Curio&s;ity was not greater than her Si&s;ter's, yet as
her Courage was greater, and her Concern in it

if po&s;&s;ible, accordingly, at length, &s;he ask'd
the Doctor, if the Name of this Gentleman was a
Secret? No, Madam, <HI>&s;ays the Doctor,</HI> the whole
Neighbourhood know the Story in general, and it
is nothing at all to his Di&s;honour. No indeed, Sir,
<HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> but ju&s;t the contrary; and if it was other|wi&s;e,
I would not have ask'd his Name. Indeed,
Madam, <HI>&s;ays the Doctor,</HI> his Name is no Secret; it
is Mr.&mdash;the elde&s;t Son of Sir <HI>Thomas&mdash;,</HI> by
whom he enjoys an E&s;tate of 2000 <HI>l.</HI> a year, and
after his Uncle, who is very old, he has near a
thou&s;and pound a year more intail'd upon him.</P>
<P>The two Si&s;ters had heard too much to hold
any longer, <HI>the younger e&s;pecially,</HI> who pretending
&s;ome Indi&s;po&s;ition, withdrew, and her Si&s;ter &s;oon
after: When her Si&s;ter came to her, &s;he &s;aid, <HI>Well,
Child, what do you &s;ay to this Story?</HI> There's no room
to think there can be any De&s;ign in this old Gen|tleman,
or any Hypocri&s;y in the Particulars, it they
are true.</P>
<P>Her Si&s;ter &s;aid never a Word, but &s;he found &s;he
had been crying, and that &s;he was &s;till too full of
it to &s;peak; &s;o &s;he let her alone a while, till, after
<PB N="161" REF="168">
after &s;ome time, fetching a great Sigh, which gave
her Pa&s;&s;ions &s;ome Vent, <HI>&s;ays the youngest,</HI> Why,
what do you &s;ay to it? I &s;ay to it! <HI>&s;ays the eldest
Si&s;ter,</HI> I can &s;ay neither le&s;s or more to it than what
the two Di&s;ciples &s;aid to one another, going to
<HI>Emmaus,</HI> about our Saviour's Di&s;cour&s;e to them, af|ter
he was gone, <HI>Did not our Hearts burn within us
when he talked to us?</HI> I am &s;ure mine did, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI>
Ay, and mine too, <HI>&s;ays the younge&s;t:</HI> But it's all
nothing to me, now. Nay, &s;ays the elde&s;t Si&s;ter,
if all the Story be true, it may be &s;omething to
you &s;till; for you &s;ee, <HI>the Doctor &s;ays,</HI> he is re&s;olv'd
to have no Body el&s;e. I give no heed to that, <HI>&s;ays
the youngest Si&s;ter,</HI> for the Tables are quite turn'd
now between us, and he ought to <HI>refu&s;e me now,</HI>
for the very &s;ame Rea&s;on that I <HI>refu&s;ed him before;</HI>
for I have not Religion enough for &s;uch a Convert
as this, I am &s;ure, any more than a Man without
any Notion of a Deity, had Religion enough for
me. Well, well, &s;ays her Si&s;ter, let Providence,
which brings all things to pa&s;s its own Way, work
as he fees &s;it; I dare &s;ay, <HI>as my Aunt &s;aid,</HI> we &s;hall
hear more of it.</P>
<P>They had very little Di&s;cour&s;e at that Time but
what ended thus: But the elde&s;t Si&s;ter had a great
mind her Father &s;hould hear the Story too, if po&s;|&s;ible
before they left the Place, and &s;he re&s;olved
to take an Opportunity to bring it about, it &s;he
could; but &s;he was happily prevented by the For|wardne&s;s
of her Father to complain of his Daugh|ter's
Nicety on all Occa&s;ions; for in Di&s;cour&s;e with
the Doctor and his Lady, the young Ladies on both
&s;ides being ab&s;ent, he took a Liberty to exclaim ve|hemently,
how fooli&s;h one of his Daughters had
been, and how &s;he had ob&s;tinately ca&s;t off a Gen|tleman
of &s;uch and &s;uch Qualifications, <HI>as before.</HI>
My Dear, &s;ays the Doctor's Lady to him, Pray
<PB N="162" REF="169">
tell Mr.&mdash;the Story you told die young Ladies
Ye&s;terday: With all my Heart, &s;aid the Doctor,
&s;o he repeated the whole Story.</P>
<P>The Father was exceedingly &s;urprized at the
Particulars, but more when <HI>the Doctor</HI> told him the
Name of the Gentleman; However? he held his
Tongue, as it happen'd, and did not let the Doctor
know how near it related to his Family; but in the
Evening, taking his Opportunity, he calls his elde&s;t
Daughter to him, <HI>Hark ye,</HI> Betty, &s;ays he, <HI>Did the
Doctor tell you a Story t'other Day of a Gentleman in</HI>
Hamp&s;hire? Yes, Sir, &s;ays &s;he: <HI>And was your Si&s;ter
by?</HI> &s;ays he Yes, Sir, &s;ays &s;he: And <HI>do you know
that this is the &s;ame Mr.&mdash;that we know of?</HI> &s;ays her
Father: Yes, Sir, &s;ays &s;he, he told us his Name: <HI>Well,</HI>
and <HI>what does your Si&s;ter &s;ay to it?</HI> &s;ays he: She &s;ays
little, Sir, <HI>&s;ays his Daughter;</HI> but &s;he cannot but be
mov'd with it, for 'tis a &s;urprizing Story. <HI>I dare &s;ay,</HI>
&s;ays her Father, <HI>I &s;hall hear of him again;</HI> &s;he won't
turn him off again, I hope; I am &s;ure &s;he does not
de&s;erve him now. She &s;ays &s;o her&s;elf, <HI>&s;ays the
Daughter,</HI> That he ought to refu&s;e her now, for
the &s;ame Rea&s;on that &s;he refu&s;ed him. <HI>Well,</HI> &s;ays
the Father, <HI>we &s;hall certainly hear of him again, I am
fully per&s;uaded;</HI> he will have no Re&s;t till he comes
to &s;ee for her again.</P>
<P>A few, Weeks after this they returned to <HI>London,</HI>
and the elde&s;t Si&s;ter being impatient to &s;ee her
Aunt, and to give her &s;ome Account of the&s;e
Things, they went both away to <HI>Hamp&s;tead:</HI> When
they came thither, file failed not to give her Aunt
a particular Account of all the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages, as well
that which had happen'd at their Vi&s;it to the Mer|chant's
Lady in <HI>London,</HI> as what had happen'd at
the <HI>Bath;</HI> all which, but e&s;pecially the la&s;t, were
wonderfully &s;urpri&s;ing and agreeable to their Aunt.
<HI>Well, Niece,</HI> &s;ays the Aunt to the younge&s;t Si&s;ter,
<PB N="163" REF="170">
<HI>what do you think of all the&s;e things?</HI> I can &s;ay little
to them, Madam, &s;ays &s;he; I am glad, For his &s;ake,
that God has open'd his Eyes. But is it no Sati&s;|faction
to you, <HI>Child, &s;ays her Aunt,</HI> that you have
been &s;o far the In&s;trument of it? <HI>Alas! Madam,
&s;ays &s;he,</HI> I the In&s;trument! I have been none of the
In&s;trument, not I. Yes, yes, <HI>replies her, Aunt,</HI> you
have, and he acknowledges it too: And turning
to the elde&s;t Si&s;ter, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> I think, Child, now
you may perform your Promi&s;e, and tell your
Si&s;ter what he &s;aid to you when he call'd here as
he went out of Town. Yes, Madam, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> &s;o
I think too<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Here &s;he gives her Si&s;ter a full Accounts of what he had &s;aid, as before.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I think you might have told me this before, <HI>&s;ays
the younger Si&s;ter.</HI> Nay, Si&s;ter, <HI>reply'd &s;he,</HI> Did you
not take me &s;hort, and forbid me telling you any
thing, and withdraw out of the Room, and bid
me tell it my Aunt? Why that's true, I did &s;o, <HI>&s;ays
&s;he again,</HI> and I have been &s;o confus'd, that I know
not when I do well, and when I do ill: Indeed,
Niece, <HI>&s;ays her, Aunt,</HI> I al&s;o obliged her not to tell
you; for I concluded, if there was any thing in
it, we &s;hould hear of it again, and if we did not,
it could do you no Service.</P>
<P>While they were talking thus, a Coach &s;topt at
the Door, and a Servant brought word their Fa|ther,
and another Gentleman with him, was below
Stairs.</P>
<P>It will be nece&s;&s;ary here to leave this Part a while,
and bring forward the Story of the young Gentle|man,
as far as it is needful to the Coherence of
Things, the Story al&s;o will be very &s;hort.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="171">
The young Gentleman having, as has been &s;aid,
taken his new Tutor, the poor Countryman, into
the Hou&s;e with him, received &s;o much A&s;&s;i&s;tance
from his Advice, and had daily &s;uch In&s;truction in
religious Things, from, the whol&s;ome plain Coun|&s;els
of this humble poor Creature, that the Benefit
of them &s;oon appeared in his Conver&s;ation, and
his Reformation &s;oon became vi&s;ible in the gene|ral
Cour&s;e of his Life, he kept Company with
the &s;obere&s;t, grave&s;t, and mo&s;t religious Per&s;ons
that ho could find; he kept a mo&s;t &s;ober, regular,
reformed Family, and &s;eeming to re&s;olve, to re&s;ide
pretty much there, for the better Government of
his Family, he took in a young Mini&s;ter of an ex|traordinary
good Character to be his Chaplain, and
cau&s;ed every Servant who appeared di&s;orderly or
vicious to be put away out of his Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e, as the natural Con&s;equences of a &s;incere
Work upon his own Mind, were the vi&s;ible Product
of that ble&s;&s;ed Change, and indeed an agreeable
Evidence of the Sincerity of it; but they were
far from being the Sum of Things; for, in a word,
he proved to be a mo&s;t pious &s;incere Chri&s;tian in
all his Ways; and as this was attended with a na|tural
Sweetnefs in his Di&s;po&s;ition, Mode&s;ty and
Genero&s;ity in his Manner, and an excellent Tem|per,
free from all manner of Pride or Hypocri&s;y,
it made him perfectly agreeable to all &s;orts of Peo|ple
I tho&s;e who were not like him valued and ho|noured
him, and the &s;ober, religious Part of Men
were delighted in him beyond expre&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>He went on thus for near two year, liv'd gene|rally
in the Country, and if he came to <HI>London,</HI>
as Occa&s;ion requir'd, yet it appeared that his
Choice was rather for the Country, e&s;pecially, be|cau&s;e
he could not be long from his faithful A&s;|&s;i&s;tant
the poor Countryman, who was upon all
<PB N="165" REF="172">
Occa&s;ions, as we may &s;ay, Clerk of the Clo&s;et to
him, and with whom he kept up a mo&s;t religious
but &s;ecret Conver&s;ation, and had Retirements with
him, which none were acquainted with but them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>But in all this Enjoyment of him&s;elf and the retir'd
Life he had now plac'd his Delight in, he found
&s;omething &s;till wanting too, as well to complete his
Happine&s;s here, as to forward his Progre&s;s in things
of an eternal and durable Nature, and he began to
&s;ay to him&s;elf, that he had robb'd him&s;elf of much
of his Comfort, in neglecting &s;o long to have the
A&s;&s;i&s;tance of that ble&s;&s;ed Creature, who God had
made the fir&s;t In&s;trument to touch his Mind with a
Sen&s;e of good Things.</P>
<P>The&s;e Thoughts dwelt upon his Heart a great
while, and he found him&s;elf very unea&s;y: It oc|curr'd
to him, that certainly, as it had plea&s;ed God
to make that young Woman give him the Alarm,
and &s;trike his Soul with the fir&s;t Sen&s;e of his
wretched Condition, he had certainly furni&s;h'd
her for his farther A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and made her capa|ble
of giving him farther Help, Light and Direc|tions
in his Duty? and that he &s;tood in the Way
of his own Comforts all the while he was without
her; nay, that he &s;eemed to reject the In&s;trument
by which God had done him &s;o much Good, with|out
inquiring whether God had de&s;igned her for
his farther Benefit or no.</P>
<P>He reflected how &s;uitable a Di&s;po&s;ition &s;he was
of in religious Things, to the De&s;ign he had of
keeping up a religious Family, and how admirable
a Wife, a Mother, a Mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;uch a Lady mu&s;t
needs be to him, and his whole Hou&s;e; who now
&s;aw the Truth of that excellent Sentence &s;he had
after repeated to him, <HI>viz. That a religious Life was
the only Heaven upon Earth.</HI> He di&s;cour&s;ed all the&s;e
<PB N="166" REF="173">
Things with his faithful Coun&s;ellor poor <HI>William,</HI>
who pre&s;&s;ed him by all the Per&s;ua&s;ions he could u&s;e
to go and make her his own; for it was the only
Fear <HI>William</HI> &s;aid he had for him, that he would
marry &s;ome Lady, who having been brought up in
the u&s;ual Levity of the Times, would pull him
backward, rather than forward him in his religious
Re&s;olutions.</P>
<P>With the&s;e Thoughts he re&s;olved to go to <HI>Lon|don,</HI>
and apply him&s;elf immediately to his former
Mi&s;tre&s;s, and obtain her for his own, if po&s;&s;ible;
but was exceedingly di&s;appointed, when he found
&s;he and her Father, and all the Family, were
gone to the <HI>Bath.</HI></P>
<P>However he waited, and hearing of their Re|turn,
he went immediately to make his Vi&s;it, with|out
any Ceremony: When he found &s;he was abroad,
he fell to work &s;eriou&s;ly with her Father; he told
him, that the la&s;t Time he was there, he had in|deed
promi&s;ed to wait on her again, but had not
yet clone it, for which he was come now to ask
her Pardon, and to give her the Rea&s;on of it, and
hoped he would give him Leave to fee his Daugh|ter
again, notwith&s;tanding what had pa&s;t. Her
Father told him he had received an Account how
his Daughter had us'd him; that he was in the
Country when it happen'd, otherwi&s;e he &s;hould
have concern'd him&s;elf to have &s;ecured him better
Treatment; that he had re&s;ented it &s;o already to
his Daughter, that he had &s;carce been in Speaking-Terms
with her &s;ince; that as to his Promi&s;e of
coming again, he believed &s;he was convinc'd that
&s;he had no Rea&s;on to expect it, &s;eeing no Gentle|man
would care to be ill us'd twice upon the &s;ame
Occa&s;ion. The young Gentleman an&s;wer'd, That
&s;he was very forry he &s;hould re&s;ent any thing from
his Daughter on his Account; that he was &s;urpriz'd
<PB N="167" REF="174">
to hear him &s;ay &s;he had ill us'd him; that upon his
Word &s;he had not done or &s;aid the lea&s;t unbecom|ing
thing to him; that he was even then when &s;he
did it, fully convinc'd of the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of
what &s;he had &s;aid, and ten times as much, <HI>if that
were po&s;&s;ible,</HI> of the ju&s;t Motives &s;he had to &s;ay it to
him; that if &s;he had done le&s;s, &s;he would have
acted from meaner Principles than he knew &s;he was
the Mi&s;tre&s;s of, and that her Rea&s;ons were &s;o good,
and &s;he &s;o well maintain'd them, that he had nei|ther
then, or now, the lea&s;t thing to offer again&s;t
them, and that his Bu&s;ine&s;s was not now to an&s;wer
her Arguments, but to &s;ee if he could comply bet|ter
with the ju&s;t Demands &s;he then made, than he
could before.</P>
<P>The Father an&s;wer'd with a great many Compli|ments
and Excu&s;es, and &s;uch like Di&s;cour&s;es; but the
Gentleman found that he neither reli&s;h'd the Rea&s;on
of his Daughter's Refu&s;al, or was affected at all with
all he could &s;ay to convince him how he had taken
it; and Mode&s;ty forbidding him to go farther in
any Declaration about religious Matters, e&s;peci|ally
where he found there was no Ta&s;te of it, he
declin'd &s;aying any more about it, but turn'd his
Di&s;cour&s;e to de&s;iring another Interview with his
Daughter upon the Terms of former Propo&s;als,
which the Father con&s;enting to, they went toge|ther
in the young Gentleman's Chariot to <HI>Hamp|&s;teads,</HI>
where the young Ladies were, and this was
the Gentleman, who, as I ob&s;erved, was come to
the Door with their Father, ju&s;t as they were above
talking of him with their Aunt.</P>
<P>I had given an Account before, that they heard
a Coach &s;top at the Gate, and that a Servant
brought up word, that, their Father and another
Gentleman was below &s;tairs: But they were &s;ur|priz'd,
you may be &s;ure, when the elde&s;t Si&s;ter,
<PB N="168" REF="175">
going down fir&s;t, comes running up &s;tairs again,
with the News, in &s;hort, that it was Mr.&mdash;,
and that their Father had brought him.</P>
<P>The Aunt, unwilling her Niece &s;hould appear
in any Di&s;order, &s;ays to her, <HI>Come, Child, you two
&s;hall &s;tay a little, and let me go down fir&s;t,</HI> which the
younger Si&s;ter was very glad of. It was ea&s;y to
perceive, and the Pa&s;&s;ages already related will al|low
us to &s;uppo&s;e, that altho' it was &s;ome Surprize
to the young Lady to have him come thus &s;udden|ly
and abruptly upon her, having not prepar'd her
Thoughts, or re&s;olv'd upon what Reception to
give him, and not having the lea&s;t Intimation from
her Father upon what Account he came, yet that
&s;he was not alarm'd <HI>as &s;he us'd to be;</HI> the Scruples of
her Con&s;cience were all an&s;wer'd; her Jealou&s;ies
of his Hypocri&s;y were over; and her Affection
had little or nothing to &s;truggle with now, unle&s;s
&s;he might doubt his Re&s;entment of Things pa&s;t, and
whether he came upon the old Account, or rather
to perform his Promi&s;e, and make a Vi&s;it of Cere|mony
only: However, &s;he beg'd her Si&s;ter to &s;peak
to her Aunt, that they might &s;tay at her Hou&s;e,
and that &s;he might receive his Vi&s;its there, becau&s;e
then &s;he would have her Aunt to advi&s;e and con|&s;ult
with, on every Occa&s;ion, and then that &s;he
would put off their being left together that Night,
that &s;he might con&s;ider Things a little, and know
the better how to receive him.</P>
<P>Her Si&s;ter went down, and &s;ending for her Aunt
into another Room, propo&s;ed the fir&s;t to her; let
me alone, <HI>Niece,</HI> for that, <HI>&s;ays &s;he:</HI> So the other
went up to her Si&s;ter, and &s;oon after the Father
calling for his two Daughters, they went down in|to
the Room. It was ea&s;y for her at fir&s;t &s;ight, to
perceive that <HI>her Lover</HI> was not at all alter'd in his
Affection to her; that he did not come to her with
<PB N="169" REF="176">
Re&s;entment, or with Ceremony; for he flew to
her, took her in his Arms, and told her, he came
to &s;ee if &s;he had Goodne&s;s enough to pardon his
not keeping his Word with her, in coming to wait
on her again, and al&s;o to claim her Promi&s;e <HI>of &s;tay|ing
for him:</HI> He &s;poke this &s;o &s;oftly, as not to be
heard by the Company, and without expecting any
An&s;wer, turn'd about to pay his Re&s;pects to her
Aunt; in doing which, he told her, he hop'd &s;he
would give him Leave to wait upon her Niece ac
her Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The Aunt took the Hint, and turning to the
Father, Brother, &s;ays &s;he to him privately, I think
if you would let my Niece &s;tay here &s;ome time,
and let the Gentleman come to wait on her here,
I would take care to prevent &s;uch little Scruples as
you know interrupted that Affair before, and you
will the &s;ooner bring it to an End, according to
your Mind. With all my hearty &s;ays, the Father;
if we had done &s;o before, I believe &s;he had not
play'd the Fool as &s;he did.</P>
<P>Upon this, turning them&s;elves to the Company,
<HI>&s;he &s;ays aloud,</HI> Niece, <HI>I don't intend to lo&s;e your Com|pany
thus;</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e if this Gentleman de&s;igns to
vi&s;it you, he won't think it a great way to come to
<HI>Hamp&s;tead,</HI> which, now the Roads are &s;o good, is
not above an Hour's driving; and I hope we &s;hall
not make his Entertainment &s;o ill, as to make him
weary of coming hither. Her Niece &s;aid, that
mu&s;t be as her Father plea&s;ed to direct; <HI>I know that
&s;ays her Aunt;</HI> and therefore I have got your Fa|ther's
Con&s;ent already. They bow'd both to her
in Token of A&s;&s;ent, and Night coming on, her
Father talk'd of going away; &s;o he cold her he
would take another Opportunity to wait on her,
which was what &s;he had de&s;ired. And thus ended
their fir&s;t Meeting.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="177">
They had &s;carce din'd the next Day, but, as he
had &s;aid, he came to vi&s;it her, and they had the
whole Afternoon to them&s;elves, and from that
Day they began to under&s;tand one another &s;o well,
that in a few Weeks Matters began to draw to a
Clo&s;e. But becau&s;e &s;ome Part of their Di&s;cour&s;e is
nece&s;&s;ary to fini&s;h the former Account, and may be
as u&s;eful as it is entertaining, I &s;hall give &s;ome
of the Particulars, as they occurr'd in Di&s;cour&s;e
between her and her Aunt and Si&s;ter, upon this
Occa&s;ion: As &s;he had advis'd with her Si&s;ter and
Aunt upon every Particular, and e&s;pecially with
her Si&s;ter, from the fir&s;t of it; &s;o &s;he made no Scru|ple
to give them a full Account of Things as they
pa&s;t. It was one Morning, after the Gentleman
had been above a Week in his new Addre&s;&s;es, that
coming into her Aunt's Dre&s;&s;ing-room, &s;he found
her Si&s;ter there drinking Coffee with her Aunt,
and her Si&s;ter began with her thus:</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Si&s;ter, you us'd to be free with
<HI>a body,</HI> and tell one now and then, how things went
with you; now we hear nothing from you; what
is it all to be a Secret?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Niece, you ought not to pre&s;s your
Si&s;ter to give an account of &s;uch Things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>When &s;he wanted Advice, <HI>Madam,</HI> &s;he
was open enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>For my Part I wi&s;h her as well as I do my
own Children; but I cannot de&s;ire her to give any

<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Madam, if I have not told any
thing, or every thing, both to you and my Si&s;ter,
it has not been by way of Re&s;erve; I am ready to
give you a full Account of all you de&s;ire; for there
is nothing pa&s;&s;es between us, that need be con|ceal'd
<PB N="171" REF="178">
from you that are &s;o near to me: As for my
Si&s;ter, I told her every Pa&s;&s;age before; and as for
you, Madam, did I not de&s;ire to be here, that I
might con&s;ult and advi&s;e with you, and have your
Directions in every Step? and I have wonder'd
you never ask'd about it before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>The chief Thing I want to know is,
how you find him as to the grand Affair of Reli|gion,
and whether you think him a Hypocrite,
or no?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, that's what I am curious about.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am but an ill Judge of Sincerity, e&s;|pecially
in a Ca&s;e where my Inclinations, you
know, are partial.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you were the nice&s;t Creature a|live
before, Si&s;ter; and yet, you know, your Af|fections
were the &s;ame way then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Niece, what can you &s;ay to that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, my Si&s;ter takes it quite wrong.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do I take you wrong, Si&s;ter?
Did you not conclude him to be an Athei&s;t?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I never &s;aid he was a Hypocrite;
If he had been no hone&s;ter than he was politick,
I had been effectually deceived; for it was too
true, as he &s;aid, if he had talk'd a little religiou&s;ly,
nay, if he had not openly profe&s;t his Contempt
of all Religion, he had cheated me, and I had ne|ver
made any Objection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true; you are right, Cou&s;in: But
how &s;tands it now? are all the Stories you told
me you heard at the <HI>Bath</HI> about him true, or no?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, I believe they are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are you but at believe &s;till? I would
have had the bottom of them all out by this time;
what have you been about all this while?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="172" REF="179">
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, we have &s;pent all the Time al|mo&s;t
about the great Difficulty of judging whether
he is &s;incere, or a Hypocrite; and we are &s;carce
got through it yet, I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then I think my Si&s;ter is mad:
What kind of Confe&s;&s;ion of Principles do you in|&s;i&s;t
on pray? I hope you don't &s;et up to examine
the Heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>You run all upon Mi&s;takes with me,
Si&s;ter; the Di&s;pute lies ju&s;t the other Way, I am
for allowing him to be &s;incere, but he will not grant
that I have any Rea&s;on to do &s;o; he &s;ays, that I
ought to believe he is a Hypocrite.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, <HI>Niece,</HI> let us have the whole Story
of it? we &s;hall then know how to judge of it to|gether.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my Heart, Madam; you know
he came to me la&s;t Tue&s;day Night, when you fir&s;t
left us together: After &s;ome Compliments, he re|peated
what he had &s;aid before, that he came to ask
my Pardon for not coming again, as he had &s;aid
he would: I told him, I did not expect him to
come again; and if I was to believe the Opinion
of other People, I had u&s;ed him &s;o rudely, that
it was not rea&s;onable to think that any Gentleman
that was &s;o treated, would ever have come again,
unle&s;s it was to affront me. He wonder'd, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI>
who could pretend to &s;ay &s;o; for <HI>he a&s;&s;ur'd me,</HI> he
not only never &s;aid I us'd him ill, but never
thought &s;o, and certainly I would not &s;ay &s;o to
any body; for he was per&s;uaded, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> I did nei|ther
do it on purpo&s;e to u&s;e him ill, or believe it
was ill U&s;age. <HI>I told him,</HI> he did me a great deal
of ju&s;tice, to &s;ay I did not act on purpo&s;e to af|front
him; but that I could not but &s;ay I thought
I had u&s;ed him a little too rudely for all that; and
that if he thought &s;o too, I was very ready to take
<PB N="173" REF="180">
this Opportunity to ask him Pardon, without &s;o
much as naming the Nece&s;&s;ity I was in on other
Accounts for doing what I did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>You were very courtly in that Particular,
Niece; pray what did he &s;ay to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>He told me, I had nothing to ask him
Pardon for, and a&s;&s;ured me he had not been gone
half an Hour from me, before he was convinc'd of
the Ju&s;tice of all I had &s;aid, and how much Rea&s;on
I had to refu&s;e him upon the Nicety which I had
refu&s;ed him upon: He added, that he had a
thou&s;and times &s;ince reproach'd him&s;elf with the
Folly of his own Conduct at that Time, or that
he could think it could recommend him to any
Woman of Vertue and Sen&s;e, to boa&s;t of having
no Thought or Sen&s;e of Religion: <HI>For,</HI> Madam,
&s;ays he, <HI>had you taken no Notice of it, I &s;hould of
Nece&s;&s;ity have concluded in a quarter of art Hour after,
that you had no Sen&s;e of Vertue or Religion your &s;elf.</HI>
Why what if I had not, <HI>&s;aid I?</HI> I had been but the
more &s;uitable to you, and you mu&s;t have lik'd me
the better for that. He return'd, No, Madam,
<HI>just the contrary;</HI> for tho' I own I had not thought
of Religion my &s;elf, yet had any Woman told me
&s;o of her&s;elf, I &s;hould pre&s;ently have &s;aid, &s;he was
no Match for a Gentleman; for no Man can be
&s;o void of Sen&s;e, as well as of Religion, as not to
know that a Woman of no Religion, is no Woman
fit to make a Wife of: <HI>And this,</HI> &s;ays he, convinc'd
me that you were in the right to refu&s;e me on that
Account.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was a very ingenious Confe&s;&s;ion, I con|fe&s;s;
the Truth of it is &s;o convincing, that I wi&s;h
all the young Women, who have their Settlement,
in View, would reflect &s;eriou&s;ly on this Point, that
however wicked Men are, they are always willing
to have &s;ober, religious and vertuous Wives; and
<PB N="174" REF="181">
'tis very rarely, that the wor&s;t Rake in Nature, if
his Sen&s;es are in Exerci&s;e, de&s;ires to have a Wife
loo&s;e like him&s;elf; but pray go on, <HI>Niece.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>He told me, he was not gone a quarter
of an Hour from me, but this Reflection &s;truck
with Horror upon his Mind; what a dreadful Crea|ture
am I! &s;ure I am a horrid &s;rightful Wretch!
that a Woman of Sobriety and Religion was afraid
to venture to take me, for fear of being ruin'd;
and that &s;he &s;hould think &s;he declared War again&s;t
Heaven, and joyned her&s;elf to one of God's Ene|mies:
He was going on, but I found his Speech
&s;top'd of a &s;udden; at which I was a little &s;urpriz'd,
and ask'd him if he was not well: He &s;aid yes,
and endeavour'd to hide the little Di&s;order he was
in, and went on: He then told me, that I had
been really very ju&s;t to him, and he had Rea&s;on to
thank me for it; and that he had de&s;ired my Si&s;ter
to expre&s;s his Mind fully on that Account, which
he hop'd &s;he had done. <HI>I told him,</HI> I could not
now enter upon an Apology for what I had &s;aid to
him <HI>&s;o long ago;</HI> that if i treated him rudely or &s;e|verely,
I was very &s;orry; <HI>but that</HI> what I did was
occa&s;ion'd <HI>as be knew very well,</HI> upon his making
&s;uch open, Declarations, <HI>and &s;uch as I thought he re|ally
had no Occa&s;ion for,</HI> concerning his Aver&s;ion to,
and Ignorance of all Religion; and that it was
really a dreadful thins to think of marrying on
&s;uch Terms; <HI>He reply'd,</HI> that if I had &s;aid le&s;s than I
did, he mu&s;t: nece&s;&s;arity, <HI>when he came to his Sen&s;es,</HI>
have had a meaner Opinion of me than he had; and
that it was really the Reproaches that I had given
him, and the excellent Rea&s;ons I had given him,
for my Resolutions of rejecting him, that had now
brought him back to me, and had made him re&s;olve to
have no Woman on Earth but me, <HI>if I would but
revoke the Re&s;olutions I had taken again&s;t him;</HI> for no|thing
<PB N="175" REF="182">
le&s;s than &s;o much Religion and Vertue could
ever make him happy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>If he was &s;incere in this, I a&s;&s;ure you,
Niece, it was a high Complement upon Religion,
as well as upon your Conduct.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I told him, that as the Rea&s;on I had for
u&s;ing him &s;o was thus approved by him&s;elf, he
bound me to pre&s;erve the &s;ame Resolution on the
Hazard of his having a lefs Efteem for me. <HI>Hle
confe&s;s'd that was very true;</HI> unle&s;s he could convince
me the Cau&s;e Was removed, <HI>which he &s;aw no hopes of,</HI>
and that was the Rea&s;on that he came to vi&s;it me
again, with &s;o little Encouragement, that he knew
not what to think of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>What could he mean by that? why
&s;ure then all we have heard mu&s;t be fal&s;e, and he is
the &s;ame Man as ever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was greatly &s;tartled at his Words, and
look'd &s;teadily at him, but could judge nothing
from his Countenance: But it grew late, and he
took his Leave, falling into &s;ome other cur&s;ory
Talk, <HI>and left me,</HI> I confe&s;s, <HI>in the greate&s;t Confu&s;ion
of Thoughts imaginable;</HI> for I was dreadfully afraid
he would declare him&s;elf to have no Sen&s;e of Re|ligion
on his Mind &s;till; and then I was in a wor&s;e
Condition than at fir&s;t, having thus admitted a &s;e|cond
Treaty with him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought, Child, you was a little per|plex'd
a Tue&s;day Night; but I took it to be only
a little Thoughtfulne&s;s more than ordinary, which
is u&s;ual on &s;uch Occa&s;ions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>When he came again the next Night, he
made a kind of an Apology for having left me in
more Disorder than he us'd to do: <HI>For to tell you
true,</HI> Madam, &s;ays he, <HI>I was not able to go on with
what I was &s;aying to you,</HI> neither am I now, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI>
&s;eeing I am come to wait on you, <HI>and yet have ef|fectually
<PB N="176" REF="183">
&s;hut the Door again&s;t my &s;elf.</HI> I told him I
did not perhaps rightly under&s;tand him, unle&s;s he
would explain him&s;elf; Why, <HI>says be,</HI> I have fir&s;t
tolds you &s;incerely, how abiolutely I approve the
Re&s;olution you took again&s;t me, and yet own'd,
and <HI>do &s;till,</HI> that I am no way able to convince you
that the Cau&s;e is removed. I told him, that I
thought he was not ju&s;t to him&s;elf; and that the
&s;ame thing, whatever it was, that had Power to
convince him that I was under a Nece&s;&s;ity to refu&s;e
him on that Occa&s;ion, would certainly a&s;&s;i&s;t him to
remove the Cau&s;e. <HI>He turn'd &s;hort upon me,</HI> but,
Madam, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> did I not make Conditions with
you, that whenever I talk'd of it, you &s;hould take
me for a Hypocrite? and did I not declare po&s;i|tively
to you, that I would deceive you if I could?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now I know what he meant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, &s;o did I too, but he run it up &s;o
high again&s;t him&s;elf, that I could not an&s;wer a
Word, unle&s;s I would have turn'd the Tables, <HI>as it
were,</HI> again&s;t my &s;elf, and courted him, by telling
him how well I was &s;atisfied of his Sincerity; &s;o
that, in &s;hort, I was quite puzzled: For what
could I &s;ay to a Man that did as it were bid me be|lieve
him to be a Hypocrite?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>You had a nice Ca&s;e before you, Cou&s;in;
pray what &s;aid you to it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I told him <HI>very coldly,</HI> I was under a Ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of believing every thing he &s;aid, becau&s;e he
had been &s;o &s;ncere with me all along; and I beg'd
him therefore not to tell me &s;eriou&s;ly <HI>now</HI> that he
was a Hypocrite; and that the Cau&s;e of my re|fu&s;ing
to talk with him before was not removed:
that I hop'd it was otherwi&s;e, but &s;hould de&s;pair of
it, if it came from his own Mouth; and that if I was
a&s;&s;ur'd from his own Mouth, that he came to de|ceive
me, he mu&s;t needs know I had nothing el&s;e
<PB N="177" REF="184">
to do, <HI>but to act as I did before,</HI> which he had
own'd I had Rea&s;on for. No, Madam, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI>
I do not &s;ay, I de&s;ire to deceive you; but, I &s;ay,
that having told you I would, you ought to believe
I de&s;ign it; and I &s;ee no room to convince you
that I am not a Hypocrite, &s;eeing I promis'd you
I would be &s;o; and I know not whether I dare tell
you. that I am not &s;o even in the be&s;t of me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I could have put an End to all this
Nicety in two Words.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you will tell me the ea&s;ier, how I
&s;hall do it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I would have told him, that tho'
I had not &s;o much Concern for him to bu&s;y my
&s;elf to inquire after his Conduct, yet I had not &s;o
little, as not to be glad to know by other Hands
than his own, that he was no Hypocrite, and that
I rejoyc'd for his Sake to hear, that his Eyes were
open'd to that which could alone make him the
happie&s;t Man alive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I mu&s;t at the &s;ame time have told
him, that my Scruples were all over about him;
which was as much as to tell him I would have him
whenever he pleas'd to take me, but I han't learn'd
that way of talking yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Niece, and if you had, after &s;o
long Acquaintance, and &s;o much pre&s;&s;ing, I do
not think you could have charg'd your &s;elf with
being forward.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, you will the better like
what has happen'd &s;ince, Madam.</P>

<P>With all my Heart; then pray go on, <HI>my
Dear.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Madam, this took up the fir&s;t
three or four Nights of our Di&s;cour&s;e: The
Night before la&s;t he, began a little more &s;eriou&s;ly,
and came clo&s;er to the Thing it &s;elf: He told me,
<PB N="178" REF="185">
he had made him&s;elf very melancholy with me the
two la&s;t Times he was with me; for he thought,
that in&s;tead of courting me to have me, he had
taken a great deal of Pains to court me to refu&s;e
him again: I told him, I thought &s;o too; and that
I confe&s;s'd I had been a little concern'd about it,
becau&s;e I could by no means under&s;tand him: He
told me it proceeded from the ju&s;t Reflection he
made on his fooli&s;h Di&s;cour&s;e two Years ago, <HI>viz.
That he wi&s;h'd he had counterfeited religious Di&s;cour&s;e;
and that he would certainly have cheated me if he could,
and did not doubt but he could have done it effectually.</HI> Tho&s;e
Words, he faid, flew in his Face, when he went
to &s;ay any thing &s;eriou&s;ly to me; and per&s;uaded
him that I would believe he was only counterfeit|ing
&s;erious Things on purpo&s;e to deceive me: I an|&s;wer'd,
he might reproach him&s;elf with tho&s;e
Things, but I did not lay any Stre&s;s on them; for
I believed he had too much Hone&s;ty, whether it
proceeded from Religion or no, &s;o offer to deceive
me in a Thing, in which he own'd &s;o ingenuou&s;ly I
was right. Then he told me, with the greate&s;t
Affection in his Di&s;cour&s;e that ever I &s;aw in my
Life, that he mu&s;t confe&s;s, as he had &s;aid before,
that my rejecting him, as I had done, had made Im|pre&s;&s;ions
on his Mind quite di&s;ferent from what he
had before; but that he found it the harde&s;t thing
in the World to expre&s;s what had happen'd to him
on that Account; and the Thoughts of tho&s;e things
that had taken up his Mind &s;ince that; only this
he would own to me, that I was in the right; that
he had mo&s;t notoriou&s;ly expo&s;ed him&s;elf to me, and
that he had perfectly the &s;ame Opinion now of tho&s;e
Things, which I had before, <HI>viz. That a religious Life
was the only Heaven upon</HI> Earth; but he could go no
farther, he &s;aid, nor could he an&s;wer for him&s;elf,
how far &s;uch Thoughts might carry him, or ex|pre&s;s
<PB N="179" REF="186">
to me the Particulars that had lain upon his
Mind about them; and how far what he had &s;aid
would &s;atis&s;y me, he did not know. I told him, I
hop'd he did not think, I &s;et up for a Judge of the
Particulars; that my Objection before lay again&s;t
a general Contempt of all Religion; that it was
my Terror to think of marrying an Enemy to God,
one that had no Sen&s;e of the common Duty we
all owe to him that made us; but that I never pre|tended
to expect a Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith from him,
or any Man, in &s;uch a Ca&s;e: <HI>He told me,</HI> he thought
it required more A&s;&s;urance than he was Ma&s;ter of,
to talk any thing of him&s;elf that way, at lea&s;t till
there was more Intimacy between us; That he
thought religious Things talk'd of in that Manner
received an Injury from the very Di&s;cour&s;e, and
that it was next door to boa&s;ting of them, which
was the wor&s;t kind of Hypocri&s;y; and if he could &s;ay
no more of him&s;&s;elf but this, he hop'd I would take
it for a &s;uffcient Te&s;timony of the Alteration of
his Thoughts, <HI>viz.</HI> That he loved me for the Ho|nour
I paid to Religion, and for that Steadine&s;s
which had made me refu&s;e him before. I told him,
I &s;aw his Difficulty, and that I would abate him
the Trouble of entring into Particulars, which I
found he was too mode&s;t to relate, and which
however I was not quite a Stranger to; and that I
de&s;ired we might &s;peak no more of a Thing which
I knew it was difficult for him to be free in: He
blu&s;h'd as red as Fire, when I &s;aid I was not a
Stranger to the Particulars which he declined to
expre&s;s, and &s;aid not one Word for a good while.
I told him, I knew it was a Point that could not
come ea&s;ily from a Man's own Mouth; that I did
not de&s;ire it, and would make him ea&s;y, &s;o far as
to tell him I was &s;atisfy'd he was no Hypocrite,
and hop'd he would give him&s;elf no more Trouble
<PB N="180" REF="187">
about it. He took me in his Arms, and told me
very affectionately, that I had &s;aid that of him, that
he would give all the World to be able to &s;ay of
him&s;elf; that however he hop'd to be beholding to
me for more than that; and as I had given him
the fir&s;t View of the Beauty of a religious Life,
he expected a great deal more from my A&s;&s;i&s;tance
and Example, in pur&s;uing the Steps of it. <HI>I told him,</HI>
that I begg'd of him we might avoid all religious
Complements, for they were the odde&s;t things in
Nature; that he quite mi&s;took me, <HI>that it was not</HI>
becau&s;e I thought my &s;elf capable of guiding in
religious Matters, that I in&s;i&s;ted on the Nece&s;&s;ity
of not marrying a Man void of Religion, but
from a due Sen&s;e of ju&s;t the contrary, <HI>viz.</HI> The
Want I &s;hould be in of being guided and a&s;&s;i&s;ted
in religious Things upon all Occa&s;ions my &s;elf:
That it would be a fatal Mi&s;take the other way, and
greatly to my Di&s;advantage, to have him expect
more from me than he would find; and that on the
contrary I thought I had now &s;o much le&s;&s; Reli|gion
than he, that he ought to refu&s;e me now, for
the &s;ame Rea&s;on that I refu&s;ed him before.</P>
<P>This is the Sum of our Affair, and thus it &s;tands,
only with this Addition, that he told me a very
plea&s;ant Story, which happen'd at a Chocolate-hou&s;e
near the Court, which is &s;o u&s;eful, as well as

<HEAD>PART II.</HEAD>
<P>_WE have &s;een the happy Conduct of the
younge&s;t of the three Daughters of
the Gentleman, who&s;e Family this
Book began with; and the comfortable
Succe&s;s of it: The &s;econd Daughter
from the Beginning acted upon other Principles,
or rather indeed upon no Principles at all; and her
Hi&s;tory may perhaps be no le&s;s fruitful of In&s;truc|tion
than the other, tho' &s;omething more tragical
as to her own Part of it.</P>
<P>She had declared to her Si&s;ter, as appears in the be|ginning
of her Story, that &s;he would not trouble her|&s;elf,
when it came to her Turn, what Religion the
Gentleman was of, or whether he had any Religion,
<PB N="184" REF="190">
or no, if &s;he had but a good Settlement; and now
we &s;hall &s;ee her be as good as her Word.</P>
<P>Her Father, who&s;e Character I have &s;ufficiently
&s;poken to already, having had for many Years a
con&s;iderable Trade into <HI>Italy,</HI> where he once liv'd;
there came an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentleman to vi&s;it him, who
had formerly been Cotemporary with him, and
long been his Corre&s;pondent or Factor there, <HI>viz.</HI>
at <HI>Leghorn;</HI> and who being grown very rich, was
come to <HI>England,</HI> re&s;olving to &s;ettle here. There
were &s;ome Accounts, it &s;eems, depending between
them, which they had appointed a Day to &s;ettle
and balance, in order to exchange Relea&s;es, which
being all fini&s;h'd in the Morning, the Father of
the&s;e Ladies takes his Factor into his Coach, and
carries him Home to Dinner with him, where the
old Gentleman entertain'd him very hand&s;omly,
and where he had an Opportunity to &s;ee the two
Maiden Daughters; for the younge&s;t, who had
been marry'd &s;ome time, was gone into <HI>Hamp&s;hire</HI>
to her Country-Seat with her Husband.</P>
<P>This <HI>Leghorn</HI> Merchant no &s;ooner &s;aw and con|vers'd
a little with the young Ladies, but he took
a Fancy to the younge&s;t, and from that time re|&s;olv'd
to make her his Wife. It was not long, be|fore
he let them know his Mind, and having made
very hand&s;ome Propo&s;ais to her Father, he (<HI>the Fa|ther</HI>)
received him with a Frankne&s;s &s;uitable to their
long Intimacy and Acquaintance, and told him,
with all his Heart, if his Daughter and he could
agree.</P>
<P>Before I bring them together, it is proper to the
Reli&s;h of the Story, to take a little Notice of the
Characters of the two young Per&s;ons, of who&s;e
Story we ought to have a general Idea, that we may
not be left to gather it up &s;lowly among the Par|ticulars.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="191">
The young Lady was very &s;ober, virtuous to
the nice&s;t Degree, extremely well bred, and won|derfully
good-humour'd; &s;he was likewi&s;e a very
lovely, beautiful Per&s;on, the hand&s;ome&s;t of the
three Si&s;ters beyond all Compari&s;on: As to Reli|gion,
&s;he had a very good Foundation of Know|ledge,
and had done nothing to make it be &s;up|po&s;ed
&s;he was not truly religious in Practice; but
&s;he was not altogether &s;o grave and &s;erious as her
elder Si&s;ter; much le&s;s was &s;he &s;o devout and &s;trict
as her younger Si&s;ter that was married, as might
be ob&s;erv'd from what pa&s;s'd between them at fir&s;t:
Her Temper was &s;prightly and gay, and tho' &s;he
govern'd her&s;elf &s;o, that &s;he gave every one room
to &s;ee, that &s;he was one that had a true Sen&s;e of
Religion at bottom, and a Fund of good Princi|ples
and good Notions in her Mind, yet &s;he was
young and merry, and did not tye her&s;elf up &s;o
&s;everely in &s;uch Things as her Si&s;ters had done;
which, tho' it was no Part of her Happine&s;s in the
Affair before her, yet it render'd her very agree|able
to her Father; and particularly, it made the
Affair with this Gentleman much ea&s;ier to her Fa|ther,
and he had much le&s;s Trouble with her, than
he had had with her two Si&s;ters.</P>
<P>The Gentleman was, as I have ob&s;erv'd, an
<HI>Italian</HI> Merchant, a very hand&s;ome, agreeable Per|&s;on,
perfectly well bred, having liv'd abroad, and
&s;een a great deal of the World: He was al&s;o a Man
of excellent Parts and Sen&s;e, talk'd admirably well
almo&s;t to every Thing that came in his Way; &s;poke
&s;everal Languages; and in &s;hort, was not a com|plete
bred Merchant only, but much of a Gentle|man;
and to all this was to be added, that he was
very &s;ober, grave, and oftentimes, as occa&s;ion of|fer'd,
his Di&s;cour&s;e upon religious Affairs di&s;cover'd
him to be very &s;erious and religious: As to his
<PB N="186" REF="192">
E&s;tate, it was not very well only, but extraordi|nary;
he was indeed a little too old, having liv'd
abroad about 22 Years, and was about &s;o much a|bove
twenty, which was the Age of the Lady:
However, as this was an Advantage in many other
Ways, in his Judgment and Experience in the
World, the Father made no Scruple at all of it,
nor did his Daughter inquire much after it.</P>
<P>In a Word, having been introduced to the young
Lady, &s;he mu&s;t have been a Woman of much more
Nicety and Scruple than &s;he profe&s;s'd her&s;elf to be,
if &s;he had di&s;lik'd any thing in his Per&s;on or Cir|cum&s;tances;
and therefore having kept her Com|pany
for &s;ome Weeks, Things began to draw to|wards
a Clo&s;e, when one Evening after the Gentle|man
had been with her, and was gone away, her
elde&s;t Si&s;ter and &s;e happened to meet; and the
following Dialogue between them may farther ex|plain
the Ca&s;e.</P>

I have no Obligation at all upon me, as I know of.</P>

<P>Why do you &s;ay &s;o, Si&s;ter? I mean
the Obligation, which is upon us all from the Charge
my Mother gave us upon her Death-bed, about
our marrying religious Husbands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I look upon what my Mother &s;aid to be
good Coun&s;el, which we &s;hould give its due Weight
to; but I do not take it to be a Command that
binds me ab&s;olutely in Duty to my Mother's Word;
Duty certainly ends when Death &s;eparates.</P>

<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not whether it does, or no,
Si&s;ter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think you are too &s;uper&s;titious that way,
Si&s;ter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but &s;uppo&s;e it to be but as <HI>Ad|vice,</HI>
yet it has a double Force with it: <HI>First,</HI> as it
came from a tender, dear and mo&s;t affectionate
Mother, who not only mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionately lov'd us,
but had an excellent Judgment to direct her to give
us the be&s;t Coun&s;el: And, <HI>Secondly,</HI> as our own
Judgment and Con&s;ciences mu&s;t te&s;tify with her,
that what &s;he enjoyn'd us to ob&s;erve, is the mo&s;t
rea&s;onable nece&s;&s;ary Thing for us to do that can be
imagin'd for our own Advantage, and as well for
our Happine&s;s here as hereafter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>You lay a greater Stre&s;s upon it than I do,
I confe&s;s: If my Mother had been alive indeed, I
&s;hould have thought my &s;elf oblig'd to be guided
by her Directions, and her Injunctions would have
<PB N="189" REF="195">
been po&s;itive Commands; but then &s;he would have
been able to judge of particular Circum&s;tances, and
would have given her Advice accordingly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>But her Advice to us was therefore
&s;uited to her pre&s;ent State of Ab&s;ence, and went
no farther than to a Cafe de&s;cribed by its own Cir|cum&s;tances,
and which nothing can alter, becau&s;e
the Obligation &s;uppo&s;es the Circum&s;tance; and
where the Circum&s;tance is not, the Obligation
cea&s;es.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>You talk &s;o learnedly, I want an Explana|tion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Si&s;ter, you don't want an Expla|nation
I am &s;ure; but you are di&s;po&s;ed to lay it all
a&s;ide, as a Thing you have no need of; however,
I'll explain my &s;elf in a Word &s;peaking: Our Mo|ther
warn'd us again&s;t marrying Men of no Reli|gion,
<HI>that is,</HI> Men that made no Profe&s;&s;ion of a
Reverence to God and his Wor&s;hip; this Want of
a religious Profe&s;&s;ion is the <HI>Circum&s;tance</HI> which I
&s;peak of; if the Circum&s;tance does not appear,
the Advice cea&s;es; for our Mother knew we could
not judge of Sincerity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; &s;o then if a Man tells me he is re|ligious,
it's well enough, whether he &s;peaks Truth
or no.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>What need we talk of this; I hope
you have an A&s;&s;urance of the contrary in Mr.&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, not I, indeed; what A&s;&s;urance can I
have? He &s;eems to be a &s;ober Man, that's all I
know of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and I would know more of it
however, if I were you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I do know &s;omething more of it too,
now I think of it; for we were talking of &s;uch
Things one Night, when we happen'd to mention</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;, and he &s;poke of him with a great
<PB N="190" REF="196">
deal of Indignation; he &s;aid he was a horrid Athe|i&s;tical
Wretch, and that he could not bear his
Company; for he was always making a Je&s;t of
&s;acred Things, bantering all Religion in &s;uch a
Manner, that no &s;ober Mind could abide it with|out
Horror.</P>

<P>Well, there is &s;omething in that, I
a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I take it for a plain Declaration, that
he has a ju&s;t Reverence for Religion, as my Si&s;ter
took the contrary in her Lover for a Declaration of
his having no Religion at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, he told her he <HI>had not,</HI> in &s;o ma|ny
Words, and that he had not troubled his Head
about it, and did not intend to do it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, and this Gentleman has told me
he has; for he owns he has &s;o much Regard for
Religion, that he cannot hear it ridicul'd and ban|ter'd
without Horror.</P>

But&mdash;</P>

<SP>

<P>But what? What would you have me do?
Mu&s;t I examine his Principles and Opinions? Shall
I ask him to &s;ay his Catechi&s;m? If I &s;hould talk on
that Fa&s;hion to him now, what a kind of a cateche|tical
Wife will he think I &s;hall make; he'll think I
&s;hall be a Schoolmi&s;tre&s;s rather than a Wi$e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; tho' you are &s;o pert with
your Si&s;ter for&s;ooth, you need not be &s;o with him,
I hope, nor need I tell you how to manage &s;uch a
Point; but I warrant you I would find it out, what
his Opinion was, one way or another; why he
may be a Papi&s;t for ought you know yet of him;
&s;ome of them are very religious in their Way, and
&s;peak very reverently and &s;eriou&s;ly of Religion in
general.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let him be a Papi&s;t and he will, I am &s;ure
I can never ask him &s;uch a Que&s;tion; but how|ever
I am pretty well &s;ati&s;fied of that too; for I
heard him &s;ay once, he had been at Church; and
another time, accidentally &s;peaking about Religion,

<P>That's boldly &s;aid, and I mu&s;t own to

<P>I per&s;wade my &s;elf you are not &s;o in|different

thus upon a Suppo&s;ition, that you are &s;ure he is a

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well you are in the right there too; I can|not
entertain &s;uch Thoughts of him; be&s;ides my

<P>It is our Misfortune, Si&s;ter, that my

<P>And is that our Misfortune &s;ay you? I do
not &s;ee it, I confe&s;s; for I think 'tis our Bu&s;ine&s;s to
choo&s;e for our &s;elves; and I ob&s;erve where Fathers
are &s;o very &s;trait-lac'd, and confine their Children to
&s;uch and &s;uch Particulars in the Husbands or Wives
they &s;hall choo&s;e, their Children generally choo&s;e
without much Regard to tho&s;e Injunctions, or el&s;e
fly directly in the Face of them, and go quite
contrary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>You argue, Si&s;ter, from the Practice
to the Duty, as if becau&s;e Children do not regard
the Care and Concern of their Parents in their
Marriages, therefore they ought to do &s;o; and that
it was not the Duty of Parents to Direct them, or
to concern them&s;elves about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not inquire what is the Duty of Pa|rents;
I am &s;peaking of what is the Practice of
Children.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you do not ju&s;tify that Practice, I
hope?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think, <HI>take one time with another,</HI> Children
do as well, when they tru&s;t to their own Directi|ons,
I mean when they choo&s;e with Judgment:
<PB N="195" REF="201">

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a wrong way of arguing, Si&s;ter,
that becau&s;e our Father neglects it, therefore Chil|dren
are not the better for &s;uch Parents as do their
Duty, and that &s;hew a ju&s;t Concern for the religi|ous
Happine&s;s of their Children, in &s;e$tling them
in the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I do not &s;ee much Difference, I &s;ay, but
&s;ometimes one do as well as the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, there is this Difference, Si&s;ter,
that where the Parents act right, the Children are
&s;eldom ruin'd, unle&s;s it be by their own wilful Ob|&s;tinacy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>And &s;ometimes Children are ruin'd, let the
Parents do their be&s;t; nay, &s;ometimes the Parents
them&s;elves know not what to direct.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>

Doctors die no body &s;hould take Phy&s;ick.</P>

<P>Every one has Eyes to choo&s;e for them&s;elves;

<P>I don't &s;ee the Want of it, perhaps, &s;o much

<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s I do &s;ee the Want of it,
and I think it is a &s;ad thing to be left &s;o as we are,
without the Guide of our Parents, for all that;
and if we in particular &s;hould be ruin'd by it, our

but if his Care was as much employ'd in choo&s;ing
religious Husbands for us, (&s;ince he will have us

<P>I can &s;ay no more, Si&s;ter; you are re|&s;olv'd,

<P>Do! I would enter into a &s;erious Di&s;|cour&s;e
of religious Matters with him; I would
know how we were to live together, whether as
Heathens, or as Chri&s;tians; I would find out his
Principles, if he has any, or find out that he has
none: This is not catechi&s;ing him, nor is there any
thing indecent in it: You are not a&s;ham'd to in|quire
into his E&s;tate, and make Provi&s;ion for your
&s;elf out of it by a good Joynture; and will you be
<PB N="197" REF="203">
a&s;ham'd to inquire after that, which is of ten thou|&s;and

before you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I tell you, it is clear to me, that he
is a Man that has a Sen&s;e of Religion upon his
Mind; I gave you an In&s;tance of it in his Dete&s;tation
of Sir <HI>Robert</HI> and his Practices: If my Si&s;ter could
have had but &s;o much Satisfaction as that, &s;he would
never have refus'd my Brother&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>You wrong my Si&s;ter, I a&s;&s;ure you;
&s;he did not come &s;o far indeed, becau&s;e &s;he came
to a clear Di&s;covery that he had no Religion at all,
which was the fir&s;t Point; but I can a&s;&s;ure you, if
&s;he had got over that Point, &s;he would have en|quir'd
farther; for 'tis a poor Satisfaction that is
founded upon Negative Religion only.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>If we expect to &s;earch into Po&s;itives, as the

our &s;elves, that we are not oblig'd to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>But certainly it is our Bu&s;ine&s;s to do it,
if we expect to live happily; for there are a great
many Men now a-days that are not Athei&s;ts, and
that abhor bantering of Religion, or making a je&s;t
of &s;acred Things; and yet have nothing at all in
them that is &s;it to be call'd Religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I am not to examine the In&s;ide; a

<P>Dear Si&s;ter, I &s;hould not &s;ay &s;o much,

out; you do not inquire after it; I do not find you
have exchange'd fix Words upon the Subject.</P>

<P>Yes, yes; but I allude only to it, and
ob&s;erve how le&s;s anxious you are, how much ea&s;ier
&s;atisfied, how &s;ooner &s;ecure, about the main Article
that con&s;titutes the Happine&s;s of your Life, and of
your Family, if ever you have one, than about
your E&s;tate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>You run this Matter up to a &s;trange Height,
Si&s;ter, as if all my Felicity con&s;i&s;ted in this one
Que&s;tion, Whether my Husband be a religious Man
or no? nay, as if it con&s;i&s;ted in his being of the
&s;ame Opinion in Religion as I am of, as if I could
not be religious, tho' my Husband was not &s;o; or,
in a Word, as if I could not go to Heaven with|out
my Husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Si&s;ter, it is you run it too high;
I do not &s;ay you cannot go to Heaven without
your Husband; or you cannot be religious without
your Husband, but I do &s;ay you cannot go com|fortably
thro' the Journey thither without him, or
he without you; A Woman is to be a Helpmeet,

and a Man is to be the &s;ame; Now a Husband will
be a &s;orry Help to a Wife, if he is not a Help in

it him&s;elf.</P>

<P>But I tell you he has a Sen&s;e of it, and an

</SP>
<SP>

<P>Well but it will hold in the other Part
of the Que&s;tion too&punc; Suppo&s;e he has, yet if his
Sen&s;e of Religion is not the &s;ame with, or agree|able
to your Sen&s;e of it; if he thinks you are go|ing
the wrong Way, and you think he is going the
wrong Way, one pulls this Way, and the other
pulls that Way, in Religion; what will this come
to in the Family, Si&s;ter? Have you con&s;ider'd
that?</P>

<P>Yes, yes, I have con&s;ider'd it very well.</P>

of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have con&s;ider'd it &s;o far, as to &s;ee that I
can do nothing in it any farther; I cannot enter
into a Debate about Principles; tell him what my
Opinion is, and ask him what his Opinion is, and
try beforehand whether they agree or no; I tell
you I don't think 'tis my Bu&s;ine&s;s, any more than

&s;uch an improper Thing for you to do: Sure I
could &s;ome way or other bring it in, that I would
make &s;ome Gue&s;s at him; why you have never
offer'd at it in the lea&s;t, neither has he &s;hewn you
any thing of it; I do not &s;o much as find that he

<P>I own I have no Ground to &s;uppo&s;e
him a Papi&s;t; but I would never marry any Man
in the World, without knowing what his Principles
are; 'tis no Satisfaction to me to &s;ay he is not an
Athei&s;t, he is not a prophane De&s;pi&s;er of Religion;
Negatives are a poor Foundation, Si&s;ter, to go up|on
in a Ca&s;e of &s;uch Con&s;equence; if he is of any
Religion, he &s;hould tell it me, or I would have no|thing
to &s;ay to him.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I told you, he &s;aid in particular, that
he was of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as by Law e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why fir&s;t, Dear Si&s;ter, I told you that's
nothing but what any Papi&s;t may &s;ay, even with|out

not &s;ay that, but in way of Di&s;cour&s;e to other

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, that's true; I have not de&s;ired any Sa|tisfaction
of him; for I take tho&s;e Ca&s;ual Occa&s;i|onal
Di&s;coveries of him&s;elf to have more of Na|ture
in them, and to be le&s;s liable to Su&s;picion,
than a formal &s;tudied An&s;wer to a jealous or doubt|ing
Que&s;tion; and I have many Rea&s;ons for my
Opinion too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that may be true; but I cannot
think that &s;uch occa&s;ional cur&s;ory Speeches can
have &s;olid Foundation enough to &s;atisfy you in a
thing of &s;uch Moment; and I think I have the
Te&s;timony of the Fathers of our Reformation on
my Side, who, without doubt, &s;aw in it the great
Weight that lies on this Part, <HI>viz.</HI> Of the Advan|tage
and Nece&s;&s;ity that there is, that Husband and
Wife &s;hould be of the &s;ame Opinion in Religion
one with another; when they appointed with the
Office of Matrimony, that the Communion be gi|ven
to the marry'd Couple at every Wedding; that
it might appear, not only that they both made a
Profe&s;&s;ion of the Chri&s;tian Religion, but that they
both agreed in the Profe&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame Princi|ples,
and joyn'd together in the &s;ame Communion
with the Reform'd Prote&s;tant Churches, and with
one another; and I think this is enough to convince
you of the Ju&s;tice of our Mother's Injunctions,
that we &s;hould not marry any Man, how religious
foever he was, unle&s;s he was of the &s;ame Opinion
in Religion with our &s;elves; or, as I ob&s;erv'd above,
that, as was the Cu&s;tom, the Man and the Wife
might communicate together.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I take that to be done principally to prevent
Prote&s;tants marrying with Papi&s;ts, and to di&s;cover

it of then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eid. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is then, becau&s;e Religion it &s;elf
is le&s;s in Fa&s;hion than it us'd to be, which indeed
is too true; al&s;o Marriages are now wholly taken
up with Mirth and gay Things, but in tho&s;e Days
Matrimony &s;eems to have been under&s;tood, <HI>as it
really is in it &s;elf,</HI> a &s;olemn and &s;erious Thing; not
to be ventur'd on ra&s;hly, con&s;ider'd of &s;lightly, or
perform'd with Levity and Loo&s;ene&s;s; 'tis a Tran&s;|action
of the greate&s;t Weight, attended with Cir|cum&s;tances
of the greate&s;t Importance, and Con|&s;equences
of the utmo&s;t Concern to our Welfare
or Mi&s;ery; The Happine&s;s of Life, the Pro&s;perity
of Families, and indeed the Intere&s;t of the Soul is
exceedingly dependent upon the good or bad Con|duct
of both Parties in this great Affair; and to
run headlong upon it, is rightly compar'd to a
Hor&s;e ru&s;hing into the Battel, and argues a mi&s;er|able
Thoughtle&s;sne&s;s of what is before us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Si&s;ter, you terrify me with talking
thus; what is it you would have me do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would have you take &s;ome Mea&s;ures,
&s;uch as Opportunity will not fail (in your Conver|&s;ation
with this Gentleman) to pre&s;ent you with,
that you may know not only <HI>negatively,</HI> that he is
no Hater and De&s;pi&s;er of God and Religion, but
<HI>po&s;itively</HI> what his Principles in Religion are; you
<PB N="204" REF="210">
may go as far further as you &s;ee room for it, but
le&s;s than this you can never be &s;atisfied with; and
can never an&s;wer it to God, to your &s;elf, to your
Mother's dying Injunctions, nor to your Children,
if you &s;hould have any, to venture upon marrying
him without it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>If Mr.&mdash;heard your Di&s;cour&s;e, he
would think you very much his Enemy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>If he was in his Sen&s;es, he
would think
me very much his Friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, quite the contrary, I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, <HI>My Dear,</HI> let me ask you one
Que&s;tion; for I mu&s;t own to you this is one of my
great &s;u&s;picions; has he inquir'd nothing after your
Religion, the Profe&s;&s;ion you make, or the Opi|nion
you are of? Has he ask'd you no Que&s;tion about
it neither?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, not a Word, he knows better; he knows
I &s;hould give him but a &s;hort An&s;wer, if he &s;hould
ask me any thing about my Religion; what do you
think I'll be catechiz'd already? No, no; it is not
come to that neither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is one of the &s;tronge&s;t Grounds
of Su&s;picion to me, and a&s;&s;ures me that he has very
little Regard to Religion in general; that he can
pretend to marry you, and know nothing whether
you are a Heathen or a Chri&s;tian; an Athei&s;t or a
religious Per&s;on, a Papi&s;t or a Prote&s;tant; the Man
can have no great Value for Religion, that is &s;o
little concern'd whether his Wife have any, or no;
for I take the Thing to weigh as much on one &s;ide
as on the other, where there is any &s;erious Con&s;i|deration
at bottom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed we have had no Di&s;cour&s;e about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>It &s;eems you are pretty well agreed;
<HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> that neither of you trouble your Heads
<PB N="205" REF="211">
about it: I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I think it will be a dread|ful
Match.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why &s;o? I tell you I have a Way to pre|vent
all the Mi&s;chief you fear, and that is, as I
told you before, I am re&s;olved we will agree; for
if he is not of my Opinion, I will be of his Opi|nion,
and &s;o we will never have any Strife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e you cannot do this; for I
take all that for loo&s;e Talk: For <HI>Example,</HI> &s;uppo&s;e
he &s;hould be a Papi&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I won't &s;o much as &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch a Thing; I
wonder you can &s;ugge&s;t it of him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>You &s;eem to be very much in the Fa&s;hi|on
of our City Ladies, Si&s;ter; I am &s;orry for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Fa&s;hion's that, Si&s;ter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why of re&s;erving their Choice of Prin|ciples,
till they &s;ee what Principles their Husbands
&s;hall be of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is it not a very obliging Cu&s;tom, Si&s;ter,
in the young Ladies? I think the Gentlemen owe
them a great deal for &s;o much Complai&s;ance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>There &s;eems to be &s;omething of Fore|ca&s;t
in it I con&s;e&s;s, <HI>viz.</HI> that they may be in a Po|&s;ture
to take any thing that offers; but there is
nothing of &s;erious Religion in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, there is a great deal of good Humour
in it; and it takes off the Occa&s;ions of religious
Di&s;putes afterward, which I take to be the wor&s;t
kind of Family Breaches.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>But is not a Concurrence of Principles
before-hand a much better Way? E&s;pecially con&s;i|dering
that the Enquiry is made during a State of
Di&s;tance, and while there is a Power of prevent|ing
the Mi&s;chiefs of being unequally yok'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I am per&s;uaded there never was &s;uch
a Thing done, except by my &s;tiff formal Si&s;ter;
Did ever a young Gentleman, when he came to
<PB N="206" REF="212">
court his Mi&s;tre&s;s, examine her, to know her Prin|ciples,
and ask her what Religion &s;he was of? Or
did ever young Lady, when &s;he was courted by
any Gentleman, &s;et up to catechize him upon the
Articles of his Creed, except, <HI>as I &s;ay,</HI> my &s;urly
Si&s;ter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me an&s;wer that Que&s;tion with a
Que&s;tion, Si&s;ter; Did ever a young Lady, that had any
Regard to Religion, and the future Happine&s;s of
her Life, &s;uffer her&s;elf to be courted two Months
by a &s;trange Per&s;on coming out of <HI>Italy,</HI> from the
very Bowels of Super&s;tition, and the very King|dom
of Popery, and go on with him even to draw|ing
of Writings, and never know what Religion
he was of, or whether he had any Religion, or no,
except that &s;he had heard by Accident that he was
not an Athei&s;t?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, mu&s;t take him <HI>for better</HI> and <HI>for wor&s;e,</HI> you know; I'll make the be&s;t of him I can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very &s;orry that I can't prevail
with you to prevent your own Misfortunes, when
it is &s;o ea&s;y to be done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>You propo&s;e what I cannot &s;o much as
mention to him; I tell you it would be the rude&s;t
Thing; I'm &s;ure, if he &s;hould do &s;o to me, I &s;hould
&s;pit in his Face, and bid him go and look for one
that was religious enough for him; &s;ure never any
&s;uch Thing was done in the World!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wonder you can talk &s;o, Si&s;ter! Do
you not remember the Pa&s;&s;ages about Mr.&mdash;,
when he courted my Cou&s;in&mdash;? Did he not
enter into a mo&s;t &s;erious pretty Di&s;cour&s;e with her
about Religion, when we were all at Table with
them? and don't you remember we all &s;aid, <HI>ay,
and you too, Si&s;ter,</HI> when you heard it? That he did
it with &s;o much Mode&s;ty, and &s;o hand&s;omely, that
nothing could be more becoming; and did not
<PB N="207" REF="213">
you, <HI>as well us I,</HI> call her a thou&s;and Fools for pre|tending
to be di&s;gu&s;ted at it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>But &s;he took ill his publick Manner of do|ing
it, which I think was wrong too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I find you don't know, or don't re|member
the re&s;t of the Story; &s;he expo&s;ed her&s;elf
to the la&s;t Degree by re&s;enting it: The Ca&s;e was
this, The Gentleman had courted her &s;ome Weeks,
and lik'd her, <HI>nay lov'd her,</HI> very well; but was
greatly perplexed to find out what Ta&s;te of Reli|gion
his Mi&s;tre&s;s had; he was loath to fall point
Blank upon her with the Que&s;tion, ju&s;t as you &s;ay
in your Ca&s;e, yet he was not willing to be &s;atisfy'd
with a &s;econd-hand Relation neither; but one Day
when we were all together at my Cou&s;in's, the
young Gentleman &s;upp'd there, and after Supper
her Mother and he and I entering into a Di&s;cour&s;e
together of &s;everal Matters, at la&s;t we began to
talk of Religion, and particularly of religious
Matches, when we were agreeably &s;urpriz'd to
hear him talk for near half an Hour wholly upon
that Subject; you were not there ju&s;t when he
talk'd of it, but we all gave you an Account of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was not there; I &s;upp'd at <HI>London</HI> that
Night, and came to you the next Day, I &s;uppo&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>You did &s;o; but it would have plea&s;ed
you to have heard him talk; he began with the
Meaning and Nature of Religion, how it con&s;i&s;ted
chiefly in Natural Duties, the Effects of the Know|ledge
and Acknowledgement of a God governing
the World, to whom we ow'd the Homage of our
Lives, and of all we enjoyed, and mu&s;t account
for the U&s;e or Abu&s;e of them then he ob&s;erv'd
how plea&s;ant and agreeable a religious Life was,
how it was Religion alone that made Life happy,
Families plea&s;ant, Society agreeable, and Relati|ons
<PB N="208" REF="214">
comfortable; how mi&s;erably &s;ome Families were
brought up for want of it; how beautiful it was to
&s;ee an Unity between Relations in Matters of that
Nature, and how dreadful the Stri&s;e was in Fami|lies
where it was otherwi&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where was &s;he all the while?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>She &s;ate ju&s;t by him, and he held her
by the Hand all the while: He went on then to
tell us a great many plea&s;ant Stories of Families
that he had known; How in &s;ome the Husband
was religious and the Wife athei&s;tic and prophane;
and in others the Wife was religious, and the Hu&s;|band
raki&s;h, loo&s;e and profiigate; and how mi&s;er|able
the one made the Life of the other: Then he
gave him&s;elf a loo&s;e to talk of the con&s;tant, never-failing
Felicity of Families where there was a Har|mony
in religious Things between Husband and
Wife; and then to try her, <HI>I &s;uppo&s;e,</HI> or perhaps to
prevent her thinking he pointed his Di&s;cour&s;e at
her, he turn'd to her, and &s;miling, <HI>My Dear,</HI> &s;ays
he, <HI>if there be any Defect on that Account between you
and I, 'twill be on my &s;ide; but I hope to be help'd forward
by you.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was a kind of a Wheedle, rather than
a &s;erious Turn in his Talk; and I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he took
it &s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, &s;he took it otherwi&s;e, I a&s;&s;ure
you; for he might ea&s;ly- &s;ee &s;he was not plea&s;ed;
however he went on, and told us a long Story of a
Couple that were marry'd, and were both very
religious, and yet, &s;aid he, they never had any
Happine&s;s any Agreement, or any practical Reli|gion
in the Family; this put me upon Enquiry in|to
the Circum&s;tances of it: <HI>Why, Madam,</HI> &s;ays he,
<HI>one was of one Opinion in Religion,</HI> and <HI>one was of an|other;
both of them were tenacious of their</HI> own Opi|nion,
<HI>and cen&s;orious of the</HI> other; One <HI>went to one
<PB N="209" REF="215">
Place to wor&s;hip, and</HI> One <HI>to another;</HI> One <HI>pray'd to
God in one part of the Hou&s;e,</HI> and <HI>One in another. Why,</HI>
&s;ays I, <HI>they pray'd to the &s;ame God, I hope; &s;ure Cha|rity
might have taught them to have pray'd together!</HI>
So far from that, Madam, <HI>&s;ays he&punc;</HI> that <HI>they not only
never pray'd with one another, but I believe they &s;carce
ever pray'd</HI> for <HI>one another in their Lives, but look'd up|on
one another as</HI> Heathens and Publicans, <HI>and &s;uch
as God him&s;elf would not hear.</HI></P>
<P>This was a &s;ad Family, Sir, <HI>&s;aid I;</HI> but I hope
there are very few &s;uch in this Nation, where Re|ligion
is &s;o heartily e&s;pous'd. Truly, Madam, <HI>says
he,</HI> it may teach us what Occa&s;ion there is for us
to &s;eek out for religious Wives, and to take Care to
be agreeable Husbands to them, when we have
them: And here he &s;aid a great many hand&s;ome
Things indeed of the little Concern Men gene|rally
took upon them&s;elves either to marry religi|ous
Wives, or to &s;ee that the Opinions of tho&s;e
they mar$ied were not too much &s;hocking with
their own; and e&s;pecially that when Men had re|ligious
Wives, or Women had religious Husbands,
they did not &s;tudy, as much as lay in them, on both
&s;ides, to bring their Opinions to agaee with one
another, bearing with one another, yielding as
much as po&s;&s;ible to one another, and the like; that
as the Scripture &s;aid, <HI>their Prayers</HI> might <HI>not be hin|dred.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well and was this the Di&s;cour&s;e that &s;he
did not like?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am &s;ure her Mother and I lik'd it;
but &s;he behaved her&s;elf &s;o &s;imply about it the next
Day, that gave him a Surfeit of her Religion, and
he declin'd her afterwards upon that very Account;
for as he told me &s;ince very &s;eriou&s;ly, &s;he di&s;co|ver'd
&s;uch a Temper at that Time, &s;uch a general
<PB N="210" REF="216">
Di&s;like of a religious Life, and of a regular Family
that made him particularly afraid of her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, he &s;hould have gone, if he was
&s;o nice; I &s;hould have lik'd his Di&s;cour&s;e no bet|ter
than &s;he did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can you &s;ay &s;o, &s;i&s;ter? when
you cannot but remember you did like it when
you heard of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hould have thought it was too publick
tho', and that it was a kind of forcing me to a Ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of giving an Account of my Opinions, whe|ther
I would or no.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, what you would have done, I
know not; but I think no Woman in her Sen&s;es
could have di&s;lik'd &s;uch a Principle as he went up|on;
it plainly &s;hew'd her that he was a Man that
placed the principal Felicity of his Life upon hav|ing
a religious Wife, a religious Conver&s;ation in
his Family, and a religious Government of it as it
increas'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>What was that to the Purpo&s;e? She would
have had him without it, and he might have talk'd
of it afterwards.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, &s;he would have had him with|out
it, that was her Folly; but he was re&s;olv'd he
would not have her without it; and that was his
Wi&s;dom; and there was an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity for
him to try before-hand what he had to expect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I would not have been try'd by him;
he &s;hould e'en have gone, I &s;ay, and taken a Fool
for his own fini&s;hing, where he could have found
her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and he did go; and you know
he marry'd afterwards a very &s;en&s;ible, &s;ober and re|ligious
Woman, and they are a very happy Family
as any I know; whereas our fooli&s;h Cou&s;in, you
<PB N="211" REF="217">
&s;ee, has marry'd a Rake; a Fellow of no Religion:
and is as mi&s;erable almo&s;t as it is po&s;&s;ible for a Wo|man
that has a good E&s;tate to be made in this
World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Si&s;ter, and how do you bring this
Story down to my Ca&s;e? I hope I am not going to
marry a Rake, <HI>as &s;he has done;</HI> if I thought it was
&s;o, I would &s;oon clear my &s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, Si&s;ter, I do not &s;ay &s;o; but
there are many kinds of Husbands to make a &s;ober
Woman mi&s;erable, be&s;ides Rakes, <HI>that I a&s;&s;ure you;</HI>
nor was it upon that Account that I told you the
Story.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>What about differing in Opinions you
mean? I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I think, Si&s;ter, you are too
nice in that Ca&s;e, and run it up, I &s;ay, too high:
I can give many In&s;tances where &s;uch Matches do
<HI>very well.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Pretty well,</HI> you &s;hould have &s;aid; and
I know where you are a-going to name a Family;
I &s;uppo&s;e you mean our Cou&s;in <HI>Martha</HI>&mdash;and
Friend <HI>James&mdash;;</HI> one a &s;trict Church-woman,
and the other a Quaker.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, &s;uppo&s;e I did mean tho&s;e; they live
very comfortably, and love one another very well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad you have nam'd them, be|cau&s;e
I would argue from the be&s;t Example you
can give: I allow they live as well as 'tis po&s;&s;ible
for two of &s;o wide and irreconcileable Principles
to do, and it is owing to a world of good Humour,
Affection and Charity in both of them; but if you
think there is not &s;omething wanting between
them, which ought to be between a Man and his
Wi&s;e, &s;omething e&s;&s;ential to what we call Happi|ne&s;s,
&s;omething they would give half their E&s;tate
to have, and the Want of which robs them of the
&s;weete&s;t part of Relation, and of the be&s;t and mo&s;t
<PB N="212" REF="218">
&s;olid Comfort of a married Life; or if you think
that they are not both &s;en&s;ible of it, you are great|ly
mi&s;taken.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not conver&s;e much with them, not I,
but I know they are a very loving Couple, and
every body takes notice of it, and admires them
for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Before I go on where I was &s;peaking,
let me take notice to you, that your very la&s;t Words
now are an Argument on my Side: It is true, they
are admir'd for their kind and plea&s;ant way of liv|ing
with one another, and <HI>why is it!</HI> but becau&s;e
it is &s;o &s;eldom, &s;o rare, &s;o wonderful indeed, to
find two of differing Opinions agree &s;o well, that
all People wonder at the&s;e two; and &s;hall any
young Woman, that values her Peace, and lays
any Stre&s;s upon the Happine&s;s of an Agreement
with her Husband, venture upon &s;uch a Circum|&s;tance,
in which it mu&s;t needs be next to a Miracle
if &s;he has any &s;uch Happine&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>You don't know but there may be many
more &s;uch.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well but I'll keep to your own Example,
and I will convince you, Si&s;ter, that even in the&s;e
two, who are happy to a Miracle, yet there is an
Exception to their Felicity; and tho' they love
entirely, and that Love covers a Multitude of Things,
yet, I &s;ay, they find &s;omething wanting, which
other People have, and &s;omething that they would
be glad to have; and I have had frequent Occa&s;i|ons
in &s;erious Di&s;cour&s;e with her, to hear her &s;peak
her Mind freely to me in this very Ca&s;e; particu|larly
I will give you one Example of it, <HI>viz.</HI> One
Sunday Morning, when I went to Church with
her, O! &s;aid &s;he to me, <HI>Cou&s;in,</HI> if I could but get
this dear <HI>Jemmy</HI> of mine to go to Church with me!
Well, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> what then? What then! <HI>&s;ays &s;he.</HI> Why
<PB N="213" REF="219">
then I &s;hould be the happie&s;t Woman upon Earth&punc;
Methinks 'tis the melancholie&s;t Thing, <HI>continued
&s;he:</HI> to go alone to the Wor&s;hip of God, and the
Man that I love, and is to me as my own Soul,
won't wor&s;hip with me; it breaks my Heart; it
quite takes away all the Comfort of my Life: A
while after this, as we walk'd along the Street to
go to Church, &s;he fetch'd a deep Sigh: <HI>What's the
matter with you,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>Cou&s;in?</HI> The Matter Cou&s;in!
<HI>&s;ays &s;he;</HI> Look there, <HI>you'll &s;ee what's the Matter:
There's Mrs.&mdash;with her Husband and all her Chil|dren,
going, hand in hand, to &s;erve God together; they
live a heavenly Life;</HI> while we! <HI>tho' we love one ano|ther
better than they do a great deal, yet live like two
Strangers</HI> on the Sabbath-day, <HI>whatever we do all the
rest of the Week:</HI> Now what think you of all their
apparent Affection to one another, Si&s;ter? will
that make up the Lo&s;s?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>They live very comfortably for all that; and
their Love makes up all tho&s;e Intervals in their Sa|tisfaction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I'll tell you <HI>how comfortably they
live;</HI> I a&s;&s;ure you, tho' they are Patterns to the
whole World for extraordinary Affections, and their
Love is &s;o uninterrupted, that it does make up a|bundance
of other Things, yet here, I &s;ay, it
makes up no Intervals, I can a&s;&s;ure you of it; nay,
I think verily that Affection which it is confe&s;s'd
they have one for another, and for which they are
both &s;o admir'd, makes it the wor&s;$; at lea&s;t it
makes it the more grievous to bear; and the Part
I am telling you will prove it; pray let me go on
with it: I came back with her and din'd, and af|ter
Dinner hone&s;t <HI>James</HI> takes up his Gloves and
his Cane, and came and ki&s;s'd her, and prepares
to go to the Quakers Meeting: She could hold
no longer then, but bur&s;t out into Tears; he was
<PB N="214" REF="220">
extremely anxious to know what ail'd her, but &s;he
could not &s;peak; &s;he was unwilling to grieve him,
and unwilling to &s;ay any thing that was unkind:
he pre&s;s'd her a long time, and &s;aid a thou&s;and
tender kind Things, that I hardly expected from
him; but that made her cry the more&punc; <HI>At la&s;t,</HI> I
&s;aid to him &s;miling, I know what troubles her, but
you won't relieve her: <HI>Won't I?</HI> &s;ays he a little mov'd,
<HI>Why do&s;t thee &s;ay &s;o? I would let out my Blood to do her
any good; and &s;he knows I will &s;tick at nothing to do for
her.</HI> Why, &s;ays I, you won't &s;erve God with her:
Won't I! &s;ays he; Yes I would with all my Heart,
if &s;he would let me. This I found laid a Founda|tion
for &s;ome Di&s;pute about their Principles, but
&s;he wi&s;ely avoided that, and I perceived it, &s;o I
put it off: <HI>I dare &s;ay,</HI> &s;ays I, <HI>&s;he would give all &s;he
has in the World you would but go to Church with her
now;</HI> at that &s;he bur&s;t out, tho' full of Tears, <HI>Ay,</HI>
&s;ays &s;he, <HI>I would give him back my Jointure with all my
Heart.</HI> He took her in his Arms, and with all the
tendere&s;t and kinde&s;t Expre&s;&s;ions that he was capa|ble
of, endeavoured to pacify her, and put an End
to it, as a Thing they could not di&s;pute of without
Unkindne&s;s, and therefore better to be avoided;
but it took up the whole Afternoon to re&s;tore them
to one another, and &s;he neither went to the Church,
nor he to the Meeting, and yet here was nothing
but Kindne&s;s and Affection between them all this
while.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never heard any thing of this before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I have heard a great deal more
from her, and from him too; tho' &s;he loves him to
an Extremity, and to give him his due, he merits
all her Affection, yet as &s;he is a very &s;ober, religi|ous
Woman, &s;he is ready to break her Heart to
think &s;ometimes what a Life &s;he lives, &s;he can
&s;carce ever talk to me of any thing el&s;e, I having
<PB N="215" REF="221">
been &s;omething more intimate with her on tho&s;e
Occa&s;ions than ordinary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>What has &s;he to complain of? Has &s;he not
a kind Husband? and does he not give her all the
Liberty and Freedom in the World? Does &s;he not
go as fine, and dre&s;s as well as &s;he plea&s;es? Does
he not keep her a Coach, and give her Leave to
give her own Liveries, and go where, and do what
&s;he will? Does &s;he not live like a Queen? what
can &s;he complain of?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her Ca&s;e, in a word, Si&s;ter, is the
very Ca&s;e our dear Mother warn'd us of; and it is
not hard to tell you what &s;he has to complain of; &s;he
is a very &s;ober religious Woman, that &s;erves God
Night and Day with a Sincerity and Devotion not
ea&s;y to be found among Women, <HI>as the World goes
now,</HI> and I'll tell you what grieves her, and what
&s;he complains of: Her Husband is as religious too
in <HI>his Way</HI> as &s;he is <HI>in hers;</HI> but as there is no Har|mony
or Concurrence in their &s;everal Principles
and Ways of Wor&s;hip; &s;o there can be no publick
&s;tated Family-Wor&s;hip; he does not joyn with her,
nor &s;he cannot joyn with him, &s;o all the Thing
call'd Family Religion, the Glory of a married
State, and the Comfort of Family-Society is in|tirely
lo&s;t; the Servants are left ungovern'd, the
Children unguided; and there again is her Grief
doubled, &s;he has four little young Children; it is
true, he is a Man of too good a Humour to deny
or re&s;train her in the Education of her Children;
but it is a &s;ad Thing to her to be obliged to in&s;truct
and caution her Children again&s;t the Practice of
their Father, who&s;e Life ought to be their Pattern,
and his Practice their Example. O Si&s;ter! if ever
you come to look into &s;uch a Condition with a
feeling Sen&s;e of it, as your own, you will find, it
is not all the Tenderne&s;s of the mo&s;t affectionate
<PB N="216" REF="222">
Husband in the World can make up the Lo&s;s o$
the&s;e Things: On the other hand, he has his Di&s;|&s;atisfactions
too; he is as &s;ad on the account of
her Difference from him, as the is for his Diffe|rence
from her; &s;o that in &s;hort the Unhappine&s;s is
mutual.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>They &s;hould have con&s;ider'd and prevented
the&s;e Things beforehand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true, Si&s;ter; and that's the Rea|&s;on
of all my Di&s;cour&s;e to you; that's my Propo|&s;al
to you, and the Rea&s;on why I pre&s;s you &s;o
much to come to a Certainty in the&s;e Things; you
will have &s;ad Reflections hereafter, when 'tis pa&s;t
Remedy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not &s;o nice in the Point; I told you
my Remedy for it; if he can't come up to me;
I can come up to him; I am &s;ure he is no
Quaker.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hear you, Si&s;ter; you make light of
it now: I believe he is no Quaker, but he may be
wor&s;e; and you are not &s;ure he will equal that
Quacker in goodne&s;s of Humour, Kindne&s;s and Affection,
the want of which, I mu&s;t tell you, will
make the want of the other be &s;o much the wor&s;e
to bear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I mu&s;t run the venture of it, I think,
'tit gone too far to break off now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not been per&s;uading you to break
it off, Si&s;ter, you mi&s;take me; I am only arguing
or rather per&s;uading you to inform your &s;elf of
Things, and know before hand what you are go|ing
to do, that you may not run into Mi&s;ery blind|fold,
and make your Marriage be, <HI>as old</HI> Hobbs <HI>&s;aid
of his Death, A Leap in the Dark.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think all Marriage is a Leap in the Dark,
in one Re&s;pect or another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="217" REF="223">
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Si&s;ter, if it be &s;o, it &s;hould not
be &s;o in Matters of Religion, in whatever other
Ca&s;e it is &s;o; that &s;hould be clear, whatever is
doubtful; that &s;hould be examined into, and per|fectly
di&s;cover'd, whatever is omitted; the Mi|&s;takes
in this are fatal to both Sides, and often ir|retrievable,
and the Con&s;equences di&s;mal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is all a Hazard, and that among the re&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, Si&s;ter; I am firm in my Opi|nion;
you and I have often argued it when you
have &s;eemed to be of my Mind: It is true, there is
a Hazard in every Part of the Change of Life; we
ri&s;que our Peace, our Affection, our Liberty, our
Fortunes, but we ought never to ri&s;que our Reli|gion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I am not running the ri&s;que of my
own Religion, tho' I do not know his.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes truly in &s;ome mea&s;ure, Si&s;ter, you
do, and your own Words acknowledg'd it ju&s;t now;
Did you not &s;ay, that if he would not be of your
Opinion, you would be of his? And is it not of|ten
that we &s;ee young Women change their Opi|nions,
nay, change the very Principles of their
Religion, in Compliance with their Husbands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and is it not very well to do &s;o?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>If their Principles were ill founded be|fore,
they do well to change them to be &s;ure; but
is it not oftner that they rather abandon Principle
than exchange it; lo&s;e their Religion than increa&s;e
it? for you cannot &s;ugge&s;t, that all the Women
who have chang'd their Opinions in Compliance
with their Husbands were wrong before, and have
chang'd for the better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is better &s;o far, that it takes away the
Foundation of Family-Breaches, which you &s;peak of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="218" REF="224">
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it is a &s;ad Exchange if it be
wrong; for the Woman then exchanges the
Peace of her Conference for Peace with her Hu&s;|band;
lo&s;es her Religion, and gives up her Princi|ples
in&s;tead of exchanging them for better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>There may be &s;ome Compliance &s;ure, with|out
intirely abandoning Principle; you propo&s;e no
Medium between right and wrong.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why take our Cou&s;in we were &s;peak|ing
of, or her Husband the Quaker, let them &s;tand
for the Example: Suppo&s;e her in Compliance with
him, for you know &s;he has Affection enough to do
any po&s;&s;ible thing to oblige him, &s;hould turn Qua|ker,
would &s;he not retain a Sting in her Soul, that
would de&s;troy all her inward Peace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know what to &s;ay to that; Quakers
are Chri&s;tians I hope?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I won't enter into that; I'll allow them
to be Chri&s;tians too; but take it of him as well as
of her: Suppo&s;e him to change then, and come
over to her, then it would be the &s;ame in him,
which is all one to the Ca&s;e in hand: Pray where
is the Felicity of &s;uch a Match? where one or o|ther
is &s;uppo&s;ed to act without Con&s;cience, or a|gain&s;t
Con&s;cience, all their Days, for Conjugal
Peace, and to &s;acrifice Principle to Affection: Are
not the&s;e &s;till invincible Arguments for what I am
per&s;uading to?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;carce know what you are per&s;uading to,
not I.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, you do, Si&s;ter, very well; how|ever
I'll repeat it as often as you &s;ay &s;o: I am urg|ing
the ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of young People com|paring
their religious Principles and Opinions be|fore
Marriage; and &s;eeing that they agree, at lea&s;t
&s;o far as to lay no Foundation of a religious Breach
in the Family after Marriage; that they may wor|&s;hip
<PB N="219" REF="225">
God together, joyn in Family Precepts, and
&s;upport Family-Religion; that they may agree in
their $n&s;tructions to their Children, and joyn in
&s;etting them Examples; that there may be no Di&s;|putings
or dividings again&s;t one another, but a mu|tual
Harmony in the propagating their own eter|nal
Intere&s;ts, and that they may go hand in hand
the true Way to Heaven.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>And cannot this happen to them without a
Settlement of Circum&s;tances before-hand, that we
mu&s;t capitulate about Religion, as we do about
Joyntures and &s;ettle Principles as we do Fortunes,
always before-hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>That it may not or cannot happen &s;o,
I will not &s;ay; but if you will take the World at
large, as it is now &s;tated, between tho&s;e that have
no Religion at all, and tho&s;e who differ from
others; you mu&s;t allow, Si&s;ter, it is a Lottery of a
thou&s;and Blanks to one Prize, and who that values
their own Peace, would venture the odds?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe I &s;hall venture for all that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then either you have no Principle
now, Si&s;ter, or it's ten to one but you give it up
when you are marry'd.</P>

<SP>

<P>Perhaps you may be mi&s;taken in both.</P>

<P>Let us have it however.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>If you will have it then, it is this,
That (to repeat the former) either, as I &s;aid, you
have no Principle now, or will give up your Prin|ciples
when you are marry'd, or will be very mi|&s;erable
in a continual Family Strife to maintain
them.</P>

<HEAD>DIALOGUE II.</HEAD>
<P>_THE young Lady mentioned in the fore|going
Dialogue is now to be view'd in
another Station of Life: She was not

her Di&s;cour&s;e to her Si&s;ter, about what was before

<PB N="225" REF="231">
word, the Girl te&s;t it all to her Father; and the
Father, perfectly indifferent as to Matters of Reli|gion,
left it out of his Inquiry; and thus they were
marry'd in a few Weeks after, and abundance of
Mirth and Jollitry they had, which cover'd all the
Appearances of other Things for a great while.</P>
<P>At length, the Lady went Home to her Hou&s;e
in the City, which was magnificently furni&s;h'd;
among other rich Furniture, the Rooms were
exceedingly &s;tor'd with a noble Collection of very,
fine Paintings, done by the be&s;t Mafters in <HI>Italy:</HI>
The Part of <HI>Italy</HI> where this Gentleman had liv'd,
<HI>viz.</HI> the Duke of <HI>Tu&s;cany</HI>'s Country, being parti|cularly
eminent for choice Pictures: It happen'd
after &s;he had been &s;ometime at Home, had &s;ettled
her Hou&s;e, and had fini&s;h'd the Decorations of
her Rooms, that her Husband bringing &s;ome very
fine Pictures Home, which were newly arrived
from <HI>Italy,</HI> had, among others, three very choice
Pieces hung up in their Bed-chamber, whereof one
being a Picture of the Crucifixion, extremely va|luable
and fine, he contriv'd to have hang'd up by
the Bed&s;ide.</P>
<P>His Wife, not us'd to &s;uch Things, perfectly ig|norant
of the De&s;ign, nor at all acquainted with
the U&s;e made of them in Popi&s;h Countries, took
no manner of notice of it at fir&s;t, taking it to be
only brought in there, as it was a mo&s;t noble piece
of Painting, and that her Husband thought it was
the be&s;t Thing he could grace her Chamber with:
It happen'd her two Si&s;ters came together &s;ome time
after, <HI>as is u&s;ual,</HI> to &s;ee her Hou&s;e, and to &s;ee the find
Collection of Paintings, which they had been told &s;o
much of; and after &s;ome time, their Si&s;ter and
their new Brother led them thro' all the Apartments,
which were indeed extreme fine: the Brother in
Law, as what he took great Delight in, made it his
<PB N="226" REF="232">
Bu&s;ine&s;s to tell them the De&s;ign of the &s;everal Pic|tures,
what Places or fine Hou&s;es &s;uch and &s;uch re|pre&s;ented,
what Stories and what Faces others were
drawn for, and the like; and being his Wife's
Si&s;ters, he treated them with all the Freedom and
Kindne&s;s imaginable.</P>
<P>When they came to the Crucifixion, which
hung by the Bed&s;ide, he told them, there was one
of the fine&s;t pieces of Painting in <HI>England;</HI> told
them the Name of the Painter that had drawn it,
who, he &s;aid, was one of the be&s;t Ma&s;ters in <HI>Italy;</HI>
and I'll a&s;&s;ure you, Si&s;ter, &s;ays he, this is counted
a fine Thing in <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>But why mu&s;t it hang in your Bed-chamber,
Brother? &s;ays the other marry'd Si&s;ter, not &s;u&s;pecting
any thing;; for her elde&s;t Si&s;ter had not told her
any thing of what &s;he had &s;aid to her Si&s;ter. O
Madam, &s;ays he, they always have the&s;e Things in
their Bed chambers in <HI>Italy</HI> on a religious Account.
Well, &s;ays the Si&s;ter, but as we do not make u&s;e of
them that Way, methinks they are better any where
el&s;e. Why, Si&s;ter, &s;ays he, our Bed-chambers are
Places where we are, or ought to be mo&s;t &s;erious.
Why, &s;ays &s;he again, but we that are Prote&s;tants
do not make a religious U&s;e of them. Not &s;o much
perhaps, &s;ays he, as the Romans do; but I cannot
&s;ay but they may be u&s;eful to a&s;&s;i&s;t Devotion. Not
at all&punc; &s;ays the Si&s;ter: At lea&s;t, Madam, &s;ays he,
they can be no Di&s;advantage to us; we want all
po&s;&s;ible Helps in our Adorations. We have the
Promi&s;e of the Spirit of God to a&s;&s;i&s;t us, &s;ays the
Si&s;ter Very warmly, and need no idolatrous Pic|tures.
He &s;aw &s;he was tart, and &s;eemed to be for|ward
to di&s;pute, which he avoided; &s;o he called
them to took on another Picture, and that pa&s;s'd
off the Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="233">
After they had gone through &s;everal Apartments&punc;
and had admired the fine Paintings, as indeed they
well de&s;erved, they came to his Clo&s;et; he would have
avoided going in, and told them it was in Confu|&s;ion,
and not worth their &s;eeing; but his Wife
having told them it was her Husband's Clo&s;et, they
would not be denied: When they went in, they were
&s;urprized with the mo&s;t charming Pictures that their
Eyes had ever beheld, with abundance of Rarities,
which their new Brother, being very curious, had
pick'd up in his Travels; and in a little Room on one
&s;ide of his Clo&s;et, upon a Table cover'd with a Carpet
of the fine&s;t Work they had ever &s;een, &s;tood a Pix
or Repo&s;itory of the Ho&s;t, all of Gold, and above
them an Altar-piece of mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Painting:
He was indeed jealous of being betray'd by the&s;e
Things, but there being none but the Ladies, who
had never &s;een &s;uch Things before, and knew no|thing
by the Form, they retired without &s;o much
as di&s;covering what it was, and as for his Wife, &s;he
was &s;o perfectly ignorant, that &s;he was ea&s;ily im|po&s;ed
upon.</P>
<P>They pa&s;s'd from this Place to the other &s;ide of
the Clo&s;et, where was abundance of very fine
Pieces; but here the elde&s;t Si&s;ter could not forbear
ob&s;erving that all the Pictures on that whole &s;ide of
the Room were religious Pieces, and tho' &s;till,
without much Su&s;picion, &s;he &s;aid to him, I ob|&s;erve,
Brother, you Gentlemen that have liv'd in
<HI>Italy</HI> are &s;o in love with the Popi&s;h Cu&s;toms, that
you are always full of the&s;e Church Paintings;
here's nothing but Repre&s;entations of Chri&s;t and
the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> in one Shape or another, in every
Room in your Hou&s;e: She went on je&s;tingly for
&s;ome time, till &s;he came to the upper end of the
Room to a Picture which hung ju&s;t over an ea&s;y
Chair, and which had a Curtain drawn over it;
<PB N="228" REF="234">
he thought &s;he would not have let her Curio&s;ity
out-run her good Manners, and &s;o did not appre|hend
her opening it; but &s;he made no Scruple of
offering to fling back the Curtain, but &s;oon found
it would not run back, being, as &s;he found after
wards, to draw up in Fe&s;toons with Pullies; How|ever
&s;he di&s;coverd, by what &s;he had done, that
the Picture was the &s;ame with that in the Bed|chamber,
<HI>viz.</HI> a large Crucifix, or Picture of the
Crucifixion.</P>
<P>She &s;aid no more, but ha&s;ten'd to view what was
farther to be &s;een, yet &s;o as that it was ea&s;y to di&s;|cover
that &s;he was in no little Di&s;order. Her Si&s;ter
that came with her di&s;cover'd it fir&s;t, and ask'd
what ail'd her; then the new-marry'd Si&s;ter, who&s;e
Hou&s;e &s;he was in, came to her with the &s;ame Que|&s;tion;
&s;he own'd to them &s;he was not very well,
and that pre&s;ently gave her an Excu&s;e to withdraw
into the Womens Apartment, where &s;he had &s;ome
Room to recollect her&s;elf: However &s;he took care
not to give the lea&s;t Cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect what ail'd her;
till &s;he got an Opportunity, when no body was
in the Room with her but her younge&s;t Si&s;ter, (&s;he
who was fir&s;t marry'd) and then &s;he bur&s;t out into
Tears, and taking her Si&s;ter about the Neck, with
the greate&s;t Pa&s;&s;ion imaginable, O my Dear Si&s;ter!
&s;ays &s;he, this poor Child is utterly undone: Un|done!
&s;ays her Si&s;ter, what do you mean? I think
&s;he is nobly marry'd: O Si&s;ter! I tell you &s;he is
undone! the Man's a Papi&s;t! Some body came in|to
the Room ju&s;t as &s;he had &s;aid this, &s;o that her
Si&s;ter had no Time to ask her any farther, and &s;he,
to prevent it, added, <HI>I'll tell you more by and by;</HI> &s;o
they pa&s;s'd it over.</P>
<P>You may be &s;ure it was, after this a very unea&s;y

their Vi&s;it, both longing earne&s;tly to be at Liberty

Lift that way; and then I ob&s;erve he hangs them

hang all by the Bed&s;ide, his Altar-pieces ju&s;t
at the upper end of the Room&#62; or on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide;
I cannot imagine why Prote&s;tants, if they will
have the Pictures, &s;hould ju&s;t hang them in the

as long as they do not make the &s;ame

Pa&s;&s;ion I told her it was none of my Bu&s;ine&s;s, my
own Heart &s;truck me with Reproach; for I knew
it was my Duty: I wi&s;h this poor Child had been

<P>But as it is an Affliction to me, and that you
may be &s;ure it is, Providence &s;eems to &s;hew me my
Sin, by my Puni&s;hment; I acknowledge I was in
the wrong before, and it is not owing to my
Prudence or Concern that your Si&s;ter was not
ruin'd; Be&s;ides, every Father that has a due Concern
for the Souls of his Children, will certainly inquire
narrowly into the Principles as well as Morals of
the Per&s;ons they match them to.</P>
</SP>
<P>In a word, their Father afflicted him&s;elf &s;o much
and &s;o long upon this Matter, that his two daugh|ters
were obliged to drop their Concern for their
Si&s;ter, and apply all the Skill they had to comfort
their Father: He was &s;o overwhelmed with it, that
it threw him into a deep Melancholly, and that in|to
<PB N="240" REF="246">
to a Fit of Sickne&s;s, which, tho' he recover'd, yet
he did not in a long time thoro'$y enjoy him&s;elf; al|ways
charging and reproaching him&s;elf with having
ruin'd his Child, having regarded nothing but the
out&s;ide of Things, and referring all her Happine&s;s
to a plentiful Fortune, and a gay extravagant way
of Living.</P>
<P>This went on &s;ome time; the elde&s;t Daughter,
who was left with the Father, managed Things &s;o
prudently, that no Notice of the&s;e Things were
taken in the Family, and. her Father readily agreed
with both his Daughters, that it was by no means
proper to let their Si&s;ter know what they had di&s;|covered;
concluding, that whenever &s;he di&s;cover'd
it her&s;elf, &s;he would come Home with a &s;ad Heart,
and make her Complaint to them fa&s;t enough.</P>
<P>But they were all mi&s;taken in their Si&s;ter; for
tho' &s;he di&s;cover'd the Thing, and liv'd a melancholy
Life with her Husband upon that Occa&s;ion, yet in
eight Year that &s;he liv'd with him, &s;he never com|plained,
or made her Sorrows known to any of her
Relations, but carried it with an even &s;teady Tem|per
and bore all her Griefs in her own Brea&s;t, as
&s;hall be &s;een at large in the next Dialogue.</P>

<HEAD>DIALOGUE III.</HEAD>
<P>_THE new marry'd Couple, of whom we
have been &s;peaking, liv'd in all the Splen|dor
and Greatne&s;s, that the highe&s;t de|gree
of private Per&s;ons admits of, and
which a Family po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of an immen&s;e Wealth,
could be &s;uppo&s;ed to do; he was not only very
rich when he marry'd her; as might be &s;uppo&s;ed
by the noble Furniture of his Hou&s;e, and his very
valuable Collection of Pictures and Rarities, and
the like, of which mention has been made, but as
he fell privately into a great Affair of remitting
Money by way of <HI>England</HI> to <HI>Genoa,</HI> for Supply of
the <HI>French</HI> Armies in <HI>Italy,</HI> he got that way a pro|digious
Sum of Money; and yet acting only by
Corre&s;pondents at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> he was liable to no
Re&s;entment or Objections from the Government
here.</P>
<P>After he had lived thus about eight Years, and
in that Time had &s;ix Children by this young Lady,
he died; &s;he had four of her &s;ix Children living:
But their Father, after having in vain tried all the
Per&s;ua&s;ions, Arguments and Intreaties (for he was
too good a Husband, and too much a Gentleman
to u&s;e any other Method&s;) to bring his Wife over to
the Roman Church, left her however under
<PB N="242" REF="248">
this terrible Affliction, that having di&s;po&s;ed of hi$
va&s;t E&s;tate in a very honourable Manner, as wel
to her, as to her Children, yet he took the Educa|tion
of her Children from her, leaving them to the
Tuition of Guardians to bring them up in the Ro|man
Religion: Nor was this the Effect of his Un|kindne&s;s
to her; for except in Di&s;putes about the&s;e
Things, they never had any Difference worth the
Name of a Di&s;pute in their Lives; and at his Death
he left to her own Di&s;po&s;al above &s;ix times the
Fortune &s;he brought him; but this of his Children
was a meer Point of Con&s;cience to him, which he
could not di&s;pen&s;e with: This was an inexpre&s;&s;ible
Grief to her, and that &s;uch, and &s;o heavy, as it is
impo&s;&s;ible to repre&s;ent it in this narrow Tract, &s;o
as to &s;ay how far it afflicted her, or what ill Con|&s;equences
attended it; the Drift and De&s;ign of
this Work al&s;o lying quite another Way, <HI>viz.</HI>
to &s;hew the Manner of Life, which naturally attends
the be&s;t Matches, where the religious Principles of
the Husband and Wife are not the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The elde&s;t Si&s;ter was now marry'd al&s;o, and
marry'd very happily and comfortably; the Princi|ples
as well as Practice of her Husband not only
concurr'd entirely with her own, but an&s;wer'd
in a mo&s;t agreeable Manner to the Character which
was given to her Father of him, <HI>viz.</HI> That he was
a Per&s;on truly religious.</P>
<P>Their Father, now grown old, had been a true
Penitent for his Mi&s;takes in the pa&s;t Conduct of his
Children; and had fully made up his want of Care
in his middle Daughter's Match, by his Difficulty
in being plea&s;ed for his elde&s;t: She needed no Con|cern
for, or to &s;hew any Nicety in examining into the
Per&s;on, for her Father was &s;o very nice for her, that
&s;carce anything could plea&s;e him; he rejected &s;eve|ral
very good Offers, meerly on account of religious
<PB N="243" REF="249">
Principles, and put them off without &s;o much as
naming them to his Daughter, till at la&s;t fixing
upon a Merchant in. the City, who both for So|briety,
Piety, Opinion in Religion, and E&s;tate
&s;uited every way both his own De&s;ires and his
Daughter's Judgment, the Match, under &s;uch
Circum&s;tances was &s;oon made; The uninterrupt|ed
Felicity this young Lady enjoyed, in having the
be&s;t Husband, the be&s;t Chri&s;tian, and the be&s;t tem|per'd
Man in the World, all in one, made
her the happie&s;t Woman alive, and indeed recom|mended

Choice, by its Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>Her Father liv'd with this Daughter, when

with his own Si&s;ter, the Lady&mdash;
Widow of Sir <HI>James</HI>&mdash;, of whom mention is made
in the fir&s;t Part of this Work: He lived very ea&s;y,

of his middle Daughter; who, tho' by far the rich|e&s;t

in the mo&s;t Splendor of all the re&s;t, yet he e&s;teemed

came from the <HI>Bath,</HI> where his middle Daughter
was gone with her Husband, to acquaint them, that
her Husband, after an Indi&s;po&s;ition of no more than
five Days, was dead: It &s;urpriz'd, them all; for they
had not &s;o much as heard that he was ill; and his
Di&s;temper being a Pleuri&s;y, it was exceeding vio|lent,

His Daughters got up from Table terribly frighted,
when they &s;aw the Di&s;order their Father was in,
not knowing what the Matter was; but he per|ceiving
it, turned about &s;uddenly, and &s;aid, <HI>Your

At this they &s;at down again all &s;urpriz'd, and
Indeed &s;en&s;ibly afflicted; for, excepting his Reli|gion,

<P>It was &s;ome Months after her Husband's Death,
and when all her Affairs were in a &s;ettled Po&s;ture,
that &s;he went to divert her Thoughts a little, and

them that it might go no farther, which they wil|lingly
promi&s;ed for her Satisfaction.</P>
<P>But this open'd the Door for Variety of Confe|rences
among them, as particularly her Si&s;ters told
her, how they di&s;cover'd it fir&s;t, and afterwards
their Father and repeated all the Di&s;cour&s;es they
had had about it, and how, and for what Rea&s;on
they had re&s;olved never to mention it to her, un|le&s;s
&s;he &s;poke fir&s;t of it; concluding that perhaps
he might conceal it from her, and they would
be very loth to di&s;cover a Thing to her, which
they knew could have no other Con&s;equence at that
Time, but to ruin and afflict her: Alas Si&s;ter! &s;ays
&s;he, I di&s;cover'd it within a Fortnight after I came
Home.</P>
<P>Ay! <HI>&s;ays her younge&s;t Si&s;ter,</HI> you had a good Go|vernment
of your &s;elf to refrain unbo&s;oming to
&s;ome of us; e&s;pecially con&s;idering my Si&s;ter here,
(<HI>meaning her elde&s;t Si&s;ter</HI>) had been &s;o &s;erious with.
you upon that very Head before you were married.</P>
<P>Dear Si&s;ter, <HI>&s;ays the Widow,</HI> to what purpo&s;e is it
for any Woman, when &s;he is marry'd, to complain
of her Di&s;appointments, which &s;he knows &s;he can|not
mend?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true, <HI>my Dear,</HI> but who is there can
deny them&s;elves that Ea&s;e to their Grief?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! complaining is but a poor Ea&s;e to
&s;uch Sorrows; 'tis like Sighing, which relieves
the Heart one Moment, and doubly loads it the
next.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Si&s;ter, &s;eeing you had &s;o intire a
Ma&s;tery over your &s;elf in that Part, and you
brought the Dominion of your Rea&s;on over your
<PB N="246" REF="252">
Pa&s;&s;ions, to &s;o perfect an Exerci&s;e, which is what
I confe&s;s I mu&s;t admire you for; I &s;ay, &s;eeing you
ma&s;ter'd your &s;elf &s;o well that way, I am oblig'd
to think, you ma&s;ter'd your &s;elf as well within
Doors; and with good Conduct perhaps you made
it no Inconv$nience to you: I with you would let
us hear how you manag'd, that we may &s;ee; per|haps
difference of Opinion may be &s;o manag'd as
to make no Breaches in a Family, and it might be
as well as if it had been otherwi&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no! Si&s;ter, don't fancy &s;o: Our dear
Mother was wi&s;er than &s;o, and you were all wi&s;er
than I, to $ay &s;o much Stre&s;s upon it as you did; I
am a Convert now to my Mother's In&s;tructions,
tho' it be too lace to help it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why Mr.&mdash;and you liv'd mighty ea&s;y;
you were always mighty well with one another I
thought.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was impo&s;&s;ible to be ill with him, he was
of &s;o excellent a Temper: But this makes my Ca&s;e
perfectly in&s;tructing to others, and proves effectu|ally,
that no Goodne&s;s of the Di&s;po&s;ition, no Ex|ce&s;s
of Affection, no prudent Compliances, tho'
they make the Ca&s;e rather better than wor&s;e, can
yet make up, no not in the lea&s;t, or any way ba|lance
the inexpre&s;&s;ible Deficiency that &s;uch a
Breach in religious Matters makes in a Family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, <HI>my Dear,</HI> I &s;ee it now, with a &s;ad
Heart, but it was far from any of my Thoughts
then; you owe all the Mi&s;e$y of it to my Neglect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I dare &s;ay, you did not mi&s;tru&s;t it; I
remember you &s;aid, he had always been a Prote&s;tant
when you was at <HI>Leghorn,</HI> and that you knew he
was b$ed &s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, <HI>my Dear;</HI> but it was my Bu&s;ine&s;s to
have inquir'd farther into it; I might ea&s;ily have
known it, if I had inquir'd; for &s;everal Merchants
<PB N="247" REF="253">
told me afterwards of it, but I $aid no Stre&s;s upon
it; <HI>in &s;hort,</HI> I did not con&s;ider the Con&s;equences.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is no need to afflict your &s;elf now,
Sir, about it; my Si&s;ter is deliver'd another way,
Sir, and the Thing is over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I am a warning to all Parents, that have
the Good of their Children at Heart; never to
make light of &s;uch Things, but &s;earch them to the
Bottom: and the more their Children depend upon
them, the greater is their Obligation to be very
careful.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my Si&s;ter is deliver'd from it all now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's a &s;ad Deliverance, Si&s;ter; and it's a
dreadful Ca&s;e to be &s;o marry'd, as that the Death
of a Husband &s;hould be counted a Deliverance;
and e&s;pecially of a good Husband too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do believe he was a good Husband indeed,
that one Particular excepted; but that was a terri|ble
Circum&s;tance, and would have made the be&s;t
Husband in the World a bad Husband to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Child, and &s;o it did to me in &s;ome
Ca&s;es, tho' he was otherwi&s;e the be&s;t humour'd
Man, and the be&s;t Husband imaginable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>No que&s;tion, there was &s;ome Unea&s;ine&s;s at
fir&s;t, but it &s;eems you got over it; I wi&s;h you
would tell us, Si&s;ter, how you manag'd the fir&s;t
Di&s;covery between you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, Si&s;ter, the Unea&s;ine&s;s was not &s;o
much at fir&s;t, as at la&s;t, and had we liv'd longer to|gether,
it mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity have grown wor&s;e,
e&s;pecially as the Children grew up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed there you might have come to
cla&s;h in Matters very e&s;&s;ential to your Peace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Might have cla&s;h'd do you &s;ay! indeed,
Si&s;ter, we mu&s;t have cla&s;h'd: It was unavoidable,
it could not be, that I could be ea&s;y to have the
<PB N="248" REF="254">
Children bred Papi&s;ts, or that he could have been
ea&s;y to have them bred, <HI>as he called it,</HI> Hereticks.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was impo&s;&s;ible indeed; and the more
you were both &s;ettled and &s;erious in your Opinions,
the more impo&s;&s;ible it would be for you to yield
that Point to one another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you know, Si&s;ter, Mr.&mdash;was a
very &s;erious grave Man; and I a&s;&s;ure you, in his
Way he was very devout; and this made his yield|ing
to me &s;ometimes to be very difficult to him; he
had very &s;trong Struggles between his Principles
and his Affection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Si&s;ter, it is always &s;o where there are
differing Opinions between a Man and his Wife;
the more zealous and con&s;ciencious they are in
their &s;everal Ways, the more difficult it is for them
to yield tho&s;e Points up to one another, which Kind|ne&s;s
and Affection may incline them to give up:
But pray give us a little Account of your fir&s;t Di&s;|putes
about the&s;e Things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis a &s;ad Story, Si&s;ter, and will bring ma|ny
grievous Things to remembrance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hould be very unwilling to impo&s;e &s;o
irk&s;ome a Task upon you; but I think it will be
very in&s;tructing to us all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why it was not much above a Fortnight
after we came Home, as I ob&s;erved to you, before
I di&s;cover'd it, and the Manner was thus: I won|der'd
that every Sabbath day my Spou&s;e contriv'd
&s;ome Excu&s;e or other to avoid going to Church
with me; I had taken &s;ome Notice of it, before we
went Home, but the &s;econd Sabbath-day I took up|on
me to de&s;ire him to go; he &s;eem'd not to deny
me, and went into the Coach with me, but pre|tended
a &s;udden Thought, that he was oblig'd to
go up to St. <HI>James</HI>'s; and having very civilly hand|ed
me ou$ of the Coach, and gone with me into
<PB N="249" REF="255">
the very Place, made a light Bow, when I could
not &s;tand to per&s;uade, and went back.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>What did he take the Coach too, and leave
you to come Home on Foot?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; he never &s;hew'd me &s;o little Re|&s;pect as that; he went but as far as <HI>Temple-Bar</HI>
in the Coach, and &s;ent it back, charging the Coach|man
to go and wait for his Mi&s;tre&s;s, which he did:
This however troubled me a little, and I began to
be unea&s;y, tho' I knew not for what.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, <HI>my Dear,</HI> did nothing occur to your
Thoughts, as it did to ours, about his Pictures, his
Crucifixes, Altar-pieces, and &s;uch Things?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, not at all: I had heard my Father &s;ay
it was the Fa&s;htion in <HI>Italy;</HI> and it being &s;o remote
from my Thoughts to imagine any thing of what
was the real Ca&s;e; I had indeed no Thoughts at
all about it, till the following Affair alarm'd me. I
was with him one Day in his Clo&s;et and viewing
his fine Things, the Pictures, Imagery, and other
Rarities, of which he had abundance; and &s;ome
Pieces of Antiquity, that are of very great Value,
he was mighty bu&s;y, and pleas'd in &s;hewing me
Things, and telling me what they were; for then
they were as new to me almo&s;t, as they were to
you; at la&s;t I went into the little Room within
his Clo&s;et, and look'd upon all the fine Things
there; where you know, Si&s;ter, there are abun|dance
of valuable Pieces of Paintings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, indeed 'tis a charming Place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon the Table there flood two fine Silver
Candle&s;ticks guilded, with large Wax-Candles in
them: My Dear, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> like an innocent Fool,
the&s;e Candle&s;ticks are very fine, I think they are
much fine$ than any we have about the Hou&s;e. My
Dear, &s;ays he, if you had rather have them in your
Clo&s;et, than to let them &s;tand here, they &s;hall be
<PB N="250" REF="256">
removed: No, my Dear, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> if we &s;hould want
them upon an extraordinary Occa&s;ion, 'tis but
borrowing them of you; We &s;aid no more of that
them, but the next Day he &s;ent me in from a Gold|&s;mith's
in <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> two Pair of Candle&s;ticks larger
and finer than the&s;e, of very curious Workman|&s;hip,
and all the high embo&s;s'd Work double-gilt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>So you had no need to grutch him tho&s;e
he u&s;ed in his Clo&s;et any more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>No indeed; But to go on: After I had
done &s;peaking of the Candle&s;ticks, I laid my Hands
upon a large Piece of Crim&s;on Damask, which
&s;eemed to cover &s;omething that flood upon the
Table, and &s;tanding up about &s;even or eight Inches
high in the middle, look'd as if there were &s;everal
Things together; and going to rurn it up, I &s;aid,
what is under here, <HI>my Dear?</HI> but added with a
Smile, and chinking nothing of the matter, <HI>may I
look?</HI> Me &s;mil'd a little, but laying his Hand upon
it too, &s;aid, I had rather not, <HI>my Dear;</HI> they are
Things I brought from <HI>Italy,</HI> but nothing of Orna|ment.
Well, well, &s;ays I, let it lye; I don't de|&s;ire
to look, not I, and immediately turn'd to look
at a Picture that hung near me, and all this while
I was &s;o dull as to perceive nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Curio&s;ity was not much it &s;eems.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Innocence &s;u&s;pects no body; but a &s;trange
Turn in his Countenance gave me an Alarm, which
I was not aware of; for there was a vi&s;ible Hurry
and Confu&s;ion in his Face, when he laid his Hands
upon the piece of Damask to prevent my taking it
up; and on a &s;udden, when I &s;o ea&s;ily and uncon|cernedly
pa&s;s'd it off, all that chagrin went off of
this Countenance in a Moment, and he was as
bright and as good-humour'd again as ever; and
this made me think afterwards that there was &s;ome|thing
in it more than u&s;ual.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="251" REF="257">
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mu&s;t have been very dull if you
not, &s;eeing you, perceived &s;uch a double Altera|tion,
and this would have heightned my De&s;ire to
inquire father into it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Per haps it did &s;o too in me; but I &s;aw
evidently he was concern'd, and why &s;hould I
make him unea&s;y? I could have pa&s;s'd a hundred
&s;uch Things by, and have re&s;train'd my Curio&s;ity
while I had no Su&s;picion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but what was this to the Ca&s;e? it
&s;eems here was no Di&s;covery then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, here was a Di&s;covery too, as it pre|par'd
for further Observation: I told you, that the
next Day he &s;ent me Home two pair of Candle|&s;ticks,
which were indeed very fine, and as I was
admiring them, I de&s;ir'd to have the other fetch'd
down to compare them with; upon which he made
&s;ome Difficulty, and &s;aid, he could not tru&s;t a Ser|vant
to go into his Clo&s;et alone, where Things of
Con&s;equence lay about; but, <HI>my Dear,</HI> &s;ays he, we
will go up and match them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, that Rea&s;on was ju&s;t enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was &s;o; and I went up with him into
his Clo&s;et, but not into the inner Room; but I
ob&s;erv'd ju&s;t when he &s;tept in, he made an extraor|dinary
low Bow towards that Place where the
Candle&s;ticks &s;tood: Indeed I took no notice of it
at fir&s;t, for I verily thought he had &s;toop'd for &s;ome
thing, but when he carry'd the Candle&s;ticks in again
he did the &s;ame, and that gave me &s;ome Thought.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Si&s;t</HI> That was a Di&s;covery indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>No really it was as not yet; for as I was a per|fect
Stanger to any of their Popi&s;h Ceremonies, I
&s;carce under&s;tood it when I was told: But how|ever
it gave me &s;ome Idea of this being an extra|ordinary
Place, tho' I did not know what; and I
very&punc; innocently ask'd him this fooli&s;h laughing
<PB N="252" REF="258">
Que&s;tion; My Dear, you are mighty mannerly to
your empty Rooms, you bow as if the King was
there; he put it off with a Smile, and an An&s;wer
that was indeed according to <HI>Solomon, An&s;wer a
Fool in his Folly,</HI> My Dear, &s;ays he, 'tis our Cu&s;tom
in <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>He was no Fool; what he &s;aid was
very true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, even all this while, and farther, I was
&s;till blind; for a little while after I pu&s;h'd into the
&s;ame Place with him, not out of Curio&s;ity, but
meerly by Chance; but tho' the piece of Crim&s;on
Damask &s;ay upon the Table, yet there was nothing
under it, nor did he make any Bow as before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo, Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my Dear, there was no need of it then;
for to be &s;ure the Idol was remov'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, however, as that was more than I
knew, it caus'd all my former He&s;itations and Ob|&s;ervations
to vani&s;h, till they were renewed again
upon the following Occa&s;ion: He was taken ill
one Evening, in a Manner that alarm'd me very
much, and we were oblig'd to get him to Bed with
all &s;peed; but ju&s;t as he was undre&s;&s;ing by the
Bed&s;ide, he &s;tarted up in a kind of a Rapture, and
pulling a String which drew back a Curtain, he
ca&s;t up his Eyes towards a Picture that hung there,
and &s;aid &s;ome Words which I did not under&s;tand,
and I perceive he cro&s;s'd him&s;elf two or three
times on the Brea&s;t, and then &s;tept into Bed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>To one, that had liv'd in <HI>Italy,</HI> this had been
no Novelty at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir, I under&s;tand it well enough now,
but I did not then; however it was &s;o plain then,
that it needed no Explanation to me; but it was
&s;uch a Surprize to me, that I thought I &s;hould
have fainted; my Heart &s;unk within me, and with
a Sigh, &s;aid I to my &s;elf, O Lord! I am undone! I
<PB N="253" REF="259">
thought I had &s;poke &s;o &s;oftly, that nothing could
have overheard me; but yet &s;o unhappy was my
Pa&s;&s;ion, that he heard the la&s;t Words, and rai&s;ing
his Voice, <HI>My Dear,</HI> &s;ays he ha&s;tily, what's the
matter? what art thou undone for? I made him
no An&s;wer, which increas'd his Eagerne&s;s to know
what ail'd me, but I declin'd it: At la&s;t, he pre&s;|&s;ing
me &s;till, I an&s;wer'd, My Dear, excu&s;e me for
the pre&s;ent, I am a little frighted, with which he
rings a little Bell, that I us'd to ring for my Wo|man,
and &s;he being but in the next Room, came
running in; I bad her fetch me a little Bottle out
of my Clo&s;et, and taking a few Drops, rather by
a Counterfeit Illne&s;s than a real, put an end to his
Inquiry, and got him to &s;leep.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hould e'en have charg'd him with it
downright, and have rav'd at him for a Rogue, that
had cheated and deluded me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Si&s;ter, I did not do &s;o; I was op|pre&s;s'd
with the Terror of it, and the Di&s;appoint|ment;
but my Affection &s;tept in the way of all
Re&s;entment; I lov'd him tenderly; and be&s;ides, it
was not a time for it; for he was really very ill,
and thought he &s;hould have dy'd; it was a Spice or
Ta&s;te of the &s;ame Di&s;temper that did at la&s;t kill
him, for it was a Pleuri&s;y; and after he had &s;lept
a little, he wak'd again in &s;uch a Condition, that
frighted all the Hou&s;e, and we were forc'd to fetch
a Surgeon out of his Bed to let him Blood.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sis</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, that reliev'd him I hope.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes it did; but I name it to tell you a Cir|cum&s;tance
which attended it; We had in the Hou&s;e
an old Man, an <HI>Italian,</HI> whom he always kept in the
Counting-hou&s;e to copy his Letters, and tran&s;late his
<HI>Italian</HI> Accounts, and for &s;uch other Bu&s;ine&s;s as he
imploy'd him in and they call'd him Doctor:
The Surgeon we had &s;ent for, being in Bed, did
<PB N="254" REF="260">
not come time enough, and he grew black and
de&s;perately ill, which frighted me exceedingly; and
when he &s;aw I was under a Surprize, he made
Signs (<HI>for he could not &s;peak to be under&s;tood, he was &s;o
Bad</HI>) to call up the old <HI>Italian:</HI> When he came into
the Room, he held out his Arm, and pointing at
it with his Finger, every one might under&s;tand that
he meant he &s;hould let him blood, upon which,
immediately the old Man call'd for things proper,
and I found he had a Launcet in his Pocket; I ask'd
him if he had been us'd to it, he &s;aid, yes, Madam,
I have let him blood &s;everal times before now: In
a word, he open'd a Vein, and it gave him Ea&s;e,
and he recover'd &s;oon after.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll lay a hundred Pound then, that Doctor
is a Prie&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, he is &s;o; and I knew it quickly
after.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And after he knew that you under&s;tood it,
did he not be&s;iege you with his Di&s;cour&s;es and Im|portunities,
my Dear, to turn.</P>
</SP>

<P>No really; at lea&s;t not &s;o, as I believe is u&s;ual,
he frequently let fall &s;ome Words about it, but with
great Mode&s;ty; for he was really a very good &s;ort
of a Man, exceeding retir'd and devout; very man|nerly
and re&s;pectful; he &s;poke once at Table, (for
&s;ometimes my Spou&s;e would ask me to let him &s;up
with us) and we had been talking very chearfully,
when the Doctor &s;aid &s;omething in <HI>Italian</HI> to his
Ma&s;ter, but gave me plain Rea&s;ons to know, that he
de&s;ired I &s;hould know what he &s;aid; upon which
my Spou&s;e &s;aid to me, My Dear, what do you
think the Doctor &s;ays? I don't know, but I am
&s;ure 'tis about me; Yes, &s;ays he, &s;o it is; and he
&s;ays, I mu&s;t tell you what it is, or el&s;e you will think
he is unmannerly to &s;peak any thing in a Language
you do not under&s;tand; Well, pray, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> what is
<PB N="255" REF="261">
it he &s;ays? What Pity it is, <HI>&s;aid my Spou&s;e,</HI> &s;uch a fine
Genius as my Lady Wife is &s;hould not be within
the Pale of the Catholick Church? While my
Spou&s;e was telling me this, he look'd very earne&s;tly
at him, to ob&s;erve when he repeated the Words,
and ju&s;t as he had repeated them, the good old Fa|ther
lift up his Eyes, and &s;aid &s;ome Words &s;oftly,
but with great Appearance of Seriou&s;te&s;s, which,
it &s;eems was, to pray co Chri&s;t to convert me;
and my Spou&s;e looking very &s;eriou&s;ly too, cro&s;s'd
him&s;elf and &s;aid <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<P>This was dangerous Work indeed, Si&s;ter;

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed &s;o it did me; I an&s;wer'd to I Hus|band,
My Dear, I hope I am; and if I thought I was
not, I would not &s;leep till I was; at which the
Doctor, my Spou&s;e repeating the Words to him
&s;hook his Head, and &s;aid, <HI>No, no!</HI> &s;ignifying, that
to be &s;ure I was not; and added, he hop'd God
would hear his Prayers for me; but this was the
mo&s;t that ever he offer'd that way.</P>
</SP>

very mode&s;tly too.</P>

<P>Well, but pray go back to the Story.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I told you my Husband recover'd from
his Illne&s;s, but it was otherwi&s;e with me; for be|ing
now fully &s;atisfy'd that my Spou&s;e was a Papi&s;t,
it ca&s;t me down to that degree, and overwhelm'd
my Spirits, that I was &s;carce able to bear it, and
e&s;pecially for want of &s;ome body to lodge my
Thoughts with, and open my Soul to.</P>

<P>Why did you not charge him with it
point blank? Did he not perceive your Di&s;order?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>He did to be &s;ure, and pre&s;s'd me with the
utmo&s;t Tenderne&s;s and Importunity, to let him
know what griev'd me.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, and I &s;hould have told him of it in

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Si&s;ter, you are too tender a Wife
your &s;elf, not to know, that where there is a &s;incere
Affection, even the highe&s;t Re&s;entment expre&s;&s;es
it &s;elf in the &s;ofte&s;t Terms: I could afflict my &s;elf
freely, but I could not think of afflicting him; and
tho' I do acknowledge I thought my &s;elf ill treated,
yet I could not u&s;e him ill in return.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, tell us what you &s;aid to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, when he pre&s;s'd me to let him know
what di&s;turb'd me, I told him, I had rather bear my
Grief than complain to him; that I was too &s;en|&s;ible
he knew what I meant; when I &s;aid I was un|done;
and I beg'd him not to oblige me to blame
him, for not having been ju&s;t to me i Why, <HI>My
Dear, &s;ays he,</HI> why are you undone, if your Opini|on
in Religion and mine may differ? Mu&s;t it af|fect
our Love? Cannot we be dear to one another
without entring into Di&s;putes of that kind? Yes,
&s;aid I, my Dear, I know better than to enter into
Di&s;putes with you; but I mu&s;t reckon my &s;elf un|done
for all that: Tears &s;topt my very Breath for
a while, for this was an open Acknowledgment of
his Profe&s;&s;ion; and I would fain have flatter'd my
&s;elf &s;o much, as to hope there was yet &s;ome room
to have thought my &s;elf mi&s;taken: When he &s;aw me
&s;o overwhelm'd, he came to me, and took me in
his Arms, and &s;aid all the kind things it is po&s;&s;ible
to think of, to pacify me: My Dear, &s;ays he, tho'
you may think this a Grief to you, expert to have
it made up abundantly, by all that it is po&s;&s;ible for
<PB N="257" REF="263">
Man to do to oblige you; and indeed if all the af|fectionate
Things a Man could &s;ay or do, could
make it up, it was made up to me; if it was po&s;|&s;ible
for a Man to do any thing to make a Woman
forget her Di&s;appointment, he did it; and this
from a Man too, who had a perfect Under&s;tand|ing
of every thing that could oblige and engage
the Affections: In a word, no Man could do
more, or Woman de&s;ire more, to make up the
Lo&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Si&s;ter, and pray tell me, did
it do? was it fully made up to you? Is it po&s;&s;ible
that two can be happy in the Condition of Man
and Wife, where Opinions in Religion differ?
You have had the Experience of it to be &s;ure in
its be&s;t Fortune, with all the Advantages imagin|able:
Now be plain, and tell us, is it po&s;&s;ible the
conjugal Felicity can be compleat? Was our dear
Mother in the right or no, Si&s;ter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Si&s;ter, you put hard upon me,
becau&s;e I know I too much &s;lighted my Mother's
Injunctions; and I remember I je&s;ted with you a|bout
it, but I have paid for the Experiment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Dear Si&s;ter,</HI> tho&s;e things are forgotten
long ago; I did not intend to reflect upon them;
but I ask upon a &s;erious Account, I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly, Si&s;ter, I mu&s;t acknowledge it
is impo&s;&s;ible: I &s;ay again, I find by &s;ad Experi|ence,
it is impo&s;&s;ible: No Kindne&s;s, no Tender|ne&s;s,
no Affection can make it up; the Condition
can never be happy, God faithfully &s;erved, Chil|dren
rightly educated, the Mind perfectly ea&s;y, or
the Duty of the Relation faithfully performed,
where the Opinions in Religion differ.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am of Opinion al&s;o, that it would
have been the &s;ame, tho' your Differences had not
been &s;o great as that of Papi&s;t and Prote&s;tant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="258" REF="264">
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, all one! for we never entred into
the Que&s;tion about our Principles; I re&s;olv'd it
from the beginning, to avoid bringing on any thing
that might be unkind or di&s;oblging between us,
and he approv'd it, and did the &s;ame for the &s;ame
Rea&s;on; &s;o that I never, after the fir&s;t Di&s;cour&s;e, &s;o
much as inquired what his Opinion was; it was
&s;ufficient to have the Grief that we could not wor|&s;hip
God together, either abroad or at home; we
could not think of one another with Charity, but
as deceived Per&s;ons, out of the way of eternal
Felicity, out of God's Ble&s;&s;ing and Protection;
we could not look upon one another but with
Sighs and &s;ad Hearts: Again, we could never con|ver&s;e
with one another upon religious Subjects,
for we could not enter upon the lea&s;t &s;erious thing,
but it lead us into Contradictions and wild di&s;trac|ted
Notions, which we were immediately forc'd to
take the Help of our Affections to &s;uppre&s;s, that
we might not break out into Indecencies to one
another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Si&s;ter, and what became of your
&s;mart An&s;wers to my Si&s;ter&mdash;, when &s;he and
you talk'd of the&s;e Things, viz. That if he was
not of your Opinion, you would be of his; that
if he was a Chri&s;tian; Catholick, you was a Catho|lick
Chri&s;tian and &s;o you would have no Differ|ence
about that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly, Si&s;ter, I was young, and did
not con&s;ider what I &s;aid; and be&s;ides, I did not in
the lea&s;t &s;u&s;pect what my Si&s;ter &s;ugge&s;ted; and yet
&s;o far I have kept up to it, we have, by the help
of abundance of good Humour on his &s;ide, and a
great deal of Love on both fides, avoided Differ|ences
and Di&s;putes upon that Subject: But alas'
Si&s;ter, that's but a Negative, and it can only be
&s;aid we did not quarrel <HI>which is a great deal to &s;ay
<PB N="259" REF="265">
too;</HI> but what's this to a happy Life? How was
our Family guided, our Children educated, and
how would they have been educated, if he had
liv'd? and how was God wor&s;hipp'd? he and his
Prie&s;t at their Ma&s;s in the Oratory or Chappel; I,
and my little unhappy Babies in my Chamber and
Clo&s;et, where I mourn'd over them continually,
(rather than pray'd over them) to think that &s;ome
time or other they &s;hould be &s;natch'd from me,
and brought up in Popery; nor would it have
been much otherwi&s;e, If he had been of any other
irreconcileable Opinion; for, as I told you before,
tho' I knew his Opinion, I never ask'd it; for any
Opinion, where there is not a Harmony in wor|&s;hipping,
a joyning in publick Prayer to God, and
in joynt &s;erving him in our Families, is the &s;ame
thing, only not in the &s;ame Extreme.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but you had no private Breaches a|bout
it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, never; we carefully avoided it; But
this is but an Evidence of the dreadful Con&s;equen|ces
of &s;uch Marriages in general; for where is there
a Couple that can &s;ay, <HI>as we could,</HI> that they
have had no Jars about it? And what Breaches
have religious Differences made in Families?
But if the Happine&s;s is &s;o little, and the evil Con|&s;equences
&s;o many, even with a Husband &s;o ex|qui&s;itely
kind and obliging, and where a Woman
cannot &s;ay &s;he has any one other thing to com|plain
of, what mu&s;t be the Ca&s;e in other Families?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Si&s;ter, you hint that the longer you
liv'd, the wor&s;e tho&s;e Differences grew.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, it was impo&s;&s;ible, Si&s;ter, but as we
grew forward, the&s;e things mu&s;t have come more
in our way: We have four Children, and Mr.&mdash;
was not a Man &s;o indifferent in his Religion, as to
be more carele&s;s about the Souls of his Children, that
<PB N="260" REF="266">
I a&s;&s;ure you; and tho' he left them entirely to
my Management, when they were little; yet he
would hint &s;ometimes, that he hop'd I would leave
them free, when they grew up, to choo&s;e for them|&s;elves,
as God &s;hould inlighten them; and that at
lea&s;t we &s;hould both &s;tand neuter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>What could you &s;ay to that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>I told him I could not tell how far I could
promi&s;e that, for if I thought my &s;elf in the right
way to Heaven, I could but ill an&s;wer it to him
that gave me my Children, to &s;tand &s;till and &s;ee
them go wrong, and not endeavour to per&s;uade
them (at lea&s;t) to choo&s;e better for them&s;elves: He
told me, that was an Argument ju&s;t as &s;trong on
his &s;ide, as it was on mine; and he added &s;miling,
How &s;hall we do then to agree, <HI>my Dear,</HI> when it
comes to that? I hope we &s;hall not love le&s;s than
we do now. I told him, I had a great many me|lancholy
Thoughts about it; and thus at la&s;t we
were always fain to drop the Di&s;cour&s;e; but to this
Hour I cannot conceive how we &s;hould have done
to have divided our Childrens In&s;truction between
us, if he had liv'd to &s;ee them grown up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my Dear, God has otherwise order'd
it; and I hope the Children wilt have the Benefit
of a good In&s;truction now without that Inter|ruption.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! Sir, I perceive you do not know
their Ca&s;e yet, and this is a remaining Grief to
me that I have not mention'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's that, Child?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, by his Will he has appointed
the old Prie&s;t, who I nam'd above, to be Tutor
to my two Sons, and has &s;ettled his E&s;tate &s;o, that
unle&s;s the Tru&s;tees bring them up Roman Catho|licks,
a great deal of the E&s;tate goes from them; &s;o
that I am to be robb'd of my Children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="261" REF="267">
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am &s;urpriz'd at that; why I never heard
a word of it! and what has he done with his two
Daughters?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has left them to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you know this before, Child? Had you
any Di&s;cour&s;e about it before he died?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, as much as the Violence of his
Di&s;temper would admit; I intreated, I per&s;waded,
I argued, as much as Tears and my oppre&s;&s;ed
Thoughts would allow me; for I thought my
Heart would have bur&s;t while I talk'd to him, to
&s;ee his Condition, whom I lov'd as my own Soul;
and to think what was to befal my Children, you
can hardly conceive what a Time it was to me; it
wounds my very Spirit to look back upon it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>it was a very bitter thing no doubt: But
what &s;aid he to you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>He beg'd of me not to importune him:
He told me, it was far from being an Unkindne&s;s
to me, but his Con&s;cience oblig'd him to it, and
he could not die in Peace, if he did not, as far as
in him lay, provide for the Souls of his Children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, if it was Con&s;cience, how came it
to pa&s;s he did not do the like by his Daughters?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, he &s;aid, he thought I had a right to
their Government as a half of the Family; for,
my Dear, &s;ays he, we are Partners; but, &s;ays he,
I intreat you, and as far as I am able to do it,
injoyn you to it, let the poor innocent Babes be
reconcil'd to the Church, and brought up in the
Catholick Faith; and I hope you will in God's
due time embrace it your &s;elf.</P>

<SP>

<P>What was you able to &s;ay to him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>I ble&s;s God I made no Promi&s;e about my
Children s nor indeed was I able to &s;peak to him
for Grief; for he was in &s;uch Agonies, that my
Heart could not hold to &s;tay by him; and the

</SP>
<SP>

<P>No, no; nor &s;hall they be taken away
from you neither; our Law gives you a Right to
the bringing up your own Children, and as for
the Doctor, I'll ingage he &s;hall give you no Di|&s;turbance;
he knows his own Circum&s;tances, and
I'll take care that he &s;hall take it for a Favour to be

<P>Not that altogether, Si&s;ter, tho' that might
joyn; but it was the Effect of an excellent Di&s;|po&s;ition,

<P>Dear Si&s;ter, 'tis a &s;orry Plea&s;ure that is

as it was my great Mercy that my Husband &s;trove
constantly to make his Difference in Religion as
little trouble&s;ome and offen&s;ive to me as po&s;&s;ible,
it would very ill have become me to make it my
Je&s;t; it had been a kind of be&s;peaking the Unea|&s;ine&s;&s;es
which it was my Happine&s;s to avoid.</P>

<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, he an&s;wer'd, he hop'd he wor&s;hip'd
no Idols but me, and if he err'd in that Point,

<P>Well, while he was &s;aying this, he pulls
out the Jewel, and opening the Ca&s;e, takes a &s;mall
Crim&s;on String that it hung to, and put it about my
Neck, but kept the Jewel in his Hand, &s;o that I
could not &s;ee it; and then taking me in his Arms,
&s;it down, my Dear, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> which I did upon a

<P>Well, well, you would not have &s;tood it

wor&s;t S$are; and &s;o that which is her Duty and
her greate&s;t Happine&s;s, is made the mo&s;t dangerous

<P>Truly, Si&s;ter, I'll be very plain with you:
When he ki&s;s'd the Jewel on his Knees, and mut|ter'd

<P>Dear Si&s;ter, let me confe&s;s to you, fine
Pre&s;ents, flattering Words, and the affectionate
Looks of &s;o obliging, &s;o dear, and &s;o near a Rela|tion
are dreadful Things, when they a&s;&s;ault Princi|ples;
the glittering Jewel had a &s;trange Influence,
and my Affections began to be too partial on his
Side: O let no Woman that values her Soul ven|ture
<PB N="267" REF="273">
into the Arms of a Husband of a differing
Religion! the kinder he is, the more likely to
undo her; every thing that indears him to her,
doubles her Danger; the more &s;he loves him, the
more &s;he inclines to yield to him; the more he
loves her, the &s;tronger are the Bonds, by which he
draws heri and her only Mercy would be to have
him barbarous and unkind to her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is indeed a &s;ad Ca&s;e, where to be mi&s;er|able
is the only Safety; but &s;o it is no doubt, and
&s;uch is the Ca&s;e of every Woman that is thus un|&s;uitably
match'd; if her Husband is kind, he is a
Snare to her; if unkind, he is a Terror to her;
his Love, which is his Duty, is her Ruin, and his
&s;lighting her, which is his Scandal, is her Pro|tection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was my Ca&s;e, dear Si&s;ter; &s;uch a Jewel!
&s;uch a Husband! How could I &s;peak an unkind
Word? Every thing he did was &s;o engaging, every

do?</P>
</SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;tood up and thank'd him, with a kind
of Ceremony; but told him, I wi&s;h'd it had been
rather in any other Form. Why, my Dear, &s;ays he,
&s;hould not the two mo&s;t valuable Forms in the
World be plac'd together? I told him, that as he
plac'd a religious Value upon it, he &s;hould have it
rather in another Place; He told me, my Brea&s;t
&s;hould be his Altar; and &s;o he might adore with.
a double Delight; I told him, I thought he was
a little prophane; and &s;ince I did not place the
<PB N="268" REF="274">
&s;ame Value upon it, or make the &s;ame U&s;e of it,
as he did, I might give him Offence by meer Ne|ce&s;&s;ity,
and make that Difference which we had
both avoided with &s;o much Care, break in upon
us in a Ca&s;e not to be re&s;i&s;ted. He an&s;wer'd, No,
my Dear, I am not going to bribe your Principles,
much le&s;s force them: Put you what Value you
think fit upon it, and give me the like Liberty: I
told him, I hop'd I &s;hould not undervalue it as his
Pre&s;ent, if he did not overvalue it upon another
Account. He return'd warmly, My Dear, the
la&s;t is impo&s;&s;ible; and for the fir&s;t 'tis a Trifle;
give it but Leave to hang where I have plac'd it,
that's all the Re&s;pect I ask you to &s;how it on my
Account.</P>

Eyes, when he took me in his Arms, and ki&s;s'd
me again, ki&s;s'd my Neck where the Cro&s;s hung,

<P>No, Si&s;ter, you would not have done &s;o
I am &s;ure; neither was it my Bu&s;ine&s;s to do &s;o;
my Bu&s;ine&s;s was not to quarrel with my Husband
about his Religion, which it was now too late to
help, but to keep him from being unea&s;y about
mine.</P>

<P>Nay, Si&s;ter, that's expre&s;ly contrary to the
Scripture, where this very Ca&s;e is &s;tated in the

let her not leave him.</HI> I Cor. vii. 13.</P>

know what I &s;hould have done in it; I would not
have wore it then.</P>

Roman Catholick: Why, in foreign Countries, that

<P>Yes, Sir, my Spou&s;e de&s;ired me to put it
on, and I could not well deny him: But I did not
know how to behave; for the Amba&s;&s;ador and all
his Retinue paid &s;o many Bows and Homages to
me, or to the Cro&s;s, that I &s;carce knew what to
do with my &s;elf, nor was I able to di&s;tingui&s;h their
good Manners from their Religion, and it was
well I did not then under&s;tand <HI>Italian,</HI> for, as my

out of &s;ight.</P>

<P>I did &s;o afterwards; I lengthen'd the String
it hung to, that it might hang a little lower, but
it was too big, if it went within my Stays, it
would hurt me, nor was it much odds to him;
for if he &s;aw the String, he knew the Cro&s;s was
there, and it was all one.</P>

that the Difference is not &s;o great as has been &s;ug|ge&s;ted

wor&s;hip the &s;ame God, believe the &s;ame Creed,
expect eternal Life by the Merits of the &s;ame Sa|viour,

<HI>My Dear, &s;ays he,</HI> all your own Divines, and all

the Church; and I &s;hall never be brought to be|lieve,
but God will open your Eyes fir&s;t or la&s;t;
and be&s;ides my earne&s;t De&s;ire to per&s;uade you and
win you to embrace the true Religion, will teach
me to do it by all the Tenderne&s;s and Love that it
is po&s;&s;ible for me to &s;hew you; for to be unkind to
you, would be the way to drive you farther off;
But be it as it will, I can never abate my Affection
to you; and, <HI>my Dear,</HI> &s;ays he, (with the mo&s;t o|bliging
pa&s;&s;ionate Air of Concern that it was po&s;|&s;ible
to &s;hew,) that I hope, to love you tender|ly
and violently is not the way to keep you at a
di&s;tance from the Church, but rather to draw you,
to engage you, and let you &s;ee, that Peace, Love
Joy, Charity, and all the Vertues of a Chri&s;tian,
are to be found among us; and not that we are
Furies and Tyrants, as we have been repre&s;ented;
and when he had &s;aid this, holding me &s;till in his
Arms, he ki&s;s'd me &s;everal Times, and went on:
My Dear, &s;ays he, let God alone to change your
Heart his own way; I'll never take any Method
but that of loving you &s;incerely and mo&s;t pa&s;&s;io|nately
while I live, and praying for you even af|ter
I am in Heaven; while he &s;aid this, I &s;aw &s;uch
an inexpre&s;&s;ible Tenderne&s;s in his Countenance,
and every Word came from him with &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ion,
that I could not hold from Tears: But he had not
done yet, for while he held me in one Arm, he
put his other Hand in his Pocket, and taking out
his Pocket-book, he bad me open it; I open'd it,
and there drop'd out a loo&s;e Paper doubled pretty
thick, which I took up, and went to put it in a|gain:
Take that Paper, my Dear, &s;ays he, and
put it up; you &s;hall have a Pledge for the Conti|nuance
or my Affection to you, whether you
change your Opinion or no: I open'd it, but
<PB N="275" REF="281">
could read very little of it, for I had but newly
begun to learn <HI>Italian:</HI> What is it, my Dear? &s;aid
I: It is, &s;aid he, an A&s;&s;ignment on the Bank of
<HI>Genoa</HI> for 2000 Ducats a year, and it &s;hall be made

<P>There's not &s;uch another upon Earth, Si&s;ter

the unkinde&s;t thing you could think of; I mu&s;t
break off the Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not call it unkind; I do not mean it
the way you take it: Suppo&s;e Things at the re|mote&s;t
distance you can, or &s;uppo&s;e it to be any
other body's Ca&s;e, would you advi&s;e any other

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Unle&s;s the Lady re&s;olv'd to turn Papi&s;t;
and if that, &s;he would do be&s;t to do it before-hand,
openly and avowedly, that &s;he might not be under

the Reflection of doing it on a wor&s;e Account,

<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>But after you have &s;aid &s;o many Things
of him, that are enough to recommend him, not to
the Affection, but even to the Admiration, of any
one; what can you &s;ay to per&s;uade any young
Woman not to think that you were very happy in
him, and that con&s;equently they would be &s;o with
&s;uch another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Si&s;ter! do not &s;ugge&s;t that I was happy
with him; I had as few happy Hours, as it was
po&s;&s;ible for any one to have, that ever had a good
Husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can you convince any one of that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Si&s;ter, it is plain to any one that
knows wherein the Happine&s;s of Life con&s;i&s;ts; It's
true, I wanted nothing; I liv'd in the abundance
of all things; I had the be&s;t humour'd Husband
on Earth, and one that lov'd me to an Extreme;
which had not our Ca&s;e indeed call'd for &s;o much
Affection another way, would have been a Sin;
for, in a word, he &s;um'd up all his earthly Felicity
in his Wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you were to give that Account to the
Gentlemen of this Age, they would &s;ay you were
writing the Character of a Fool.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's no matter for that; it was his Mercy
and mine too; for if it had been otherwi&s;e, we
had been the mi&s;erable&s;t Creatures alive; it
was bad enough as it was; and all that knew him,
will grant that he was no Fool.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what do you think then would have
been the Con&s;equence, if, <HI>as you &s;ay,</HI> he had lov'd
you le&s;s? Wherein mu&s;t you have been mi&s;erable?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="277" REF="283">
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Si&s;ter, if his abundant Affection had
not clo&s;ed every Debate with Kindne&s;s, whither
mu&s;t we have run? If he had not check'd all the
Forwardne&s;s of his religious Zeal for converting
me, by his Love to me, to what Severity in our
mutual Reproaches &s;hould we have gone on! in a
word, Si&s;ter, I mu&s;t have turn'd, or turn'd out of
Doors; I mu&s;t have been a Papi&s;t, or we mu&s;t
have parted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Si&s;ter, you know there's Mr. <HI>P</HI>&mdash;
and his Wife are in the very &s;ame Ca&s;e, and yet
they agree well enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Dear Si&s;ter,</HI> How can you name them! He
is a Papi&s;t, and &s;he is a Prote&s;tant, and when the
Name is taken away, it is hard to tell whether ei|ther
of them have any Religion or no, nor do
they care one Farthing which way either goes;
People that can live ea&s;y without Religion, may
live ea&s;y with any Religion; that is not the Ca&s;e
we are &s;peaking of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is a Difference there, I confe&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if, Si&s;ter, a religious Life be <HI>the only
Heaven upon Earth,</HI> as we have been taught to be|lieve,
tell me, <HI>if you can repre&s;ent &s;uch a Ca&s;e to your
&s;elf,</HI> what mu&s;t it be for two to live together, who
place their Happine&s;s really in &s;uch a Life as we
call religious, but differ &s;o extremely about what
Religion to build it upon? That agree in the gene|ral
but not in the Particulars; that aim mutually at
the End, viz. <HI>going to Heaven,</HI> but turn Back to
Back as to the way thither? Can a religious Life
be form'd between &s;uch as the&s;e! and if not, then
they are mutually deprived of that Heaven upon
Earth, which, <HI>as you and I agree,</HI> is alone to be
$ound in a religious Life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="278" REF="284">
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is true; but then in &s;uch a Ca&s;e the
Enjoyment mu&s;t be re&s;erved and &s;ingular, and a
Woman mu&s;t keep her Religion to her&s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you will allow her then to be depriv'd
at once of all &s;ocial Religion, of all Family-Reli|gion,
and by Con&s;equence of all the Comfort of a
religious Husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay that is true, and I am not &s;peaking
for it; but asking your Experience, whether with
&s;o tender a Husband, as you had, it might not be o|therwi&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Si&s;ter, his Tenderne&s;s, <HI>as I &s;aid be|fore</HI>
was my great Mercy, as it made him beat
with my Ob&s;tinacy, <HI>as he called it:</HI> Had he had the
&s;ame Tenderne&s;s, and been indifferent in his Prin|ciples,
I might have turn'd him; but had he want|ed
that Tenderne&s;s, and yet been as zealous in his
Religion as he was, he mu&s;t have turn'd me, or I
mu&s;t have liv'd a dreadful Life with him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I find he was a mighty religious Man in
his way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>To the greate&s;t degree imaginable devout,
and very &s;erious, I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, tho' he was mi&s;taken in his Princi|ples,
yet he was the more &s;ober, the more hone&s;t,
and every way the better prepared to be a good
Man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>His Devotion made him, without doubt,
the better Man: But if it had not been for the
Re&s;traints of his Affection, it had certainly made
him the wor&s;e Husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>So that in this Que&s;tion of marrying a
Man of a different Opinion in Religion, you
&s;uppo&s;e, that the more devout and &s;erious the
Per&s;on is in his way, the wor&s;e Husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="279" REF="285">
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without que&s;tion it is &s;o: The Zeal in
their own Opinions makes them always unea&s;y and
impatient with their Wives, teazing and baiting
them with impertinent Di&s;putes, and even driving
them by force of re&s;tle&s;s Importunities, (which, by
the way, is the wor&s;t &s;ort of Per&s;ecution) into a
Compliance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I agree with you in that Part: But, Si&s;ter,
you &s;ay, that even when your Husband's Love
was your Protection from the&s;e Importunities, you
were yet unhappy, and could not be able to lead
a religious Life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Si&s;ter, I did not &s;ay &s;o; I &s;aid we
could not have a religious Family; all &s;ocial Reli|gion
was lo&s;t; mutual Help and A&s;&s;i&s;tance in Re|ligion
were wanting; publick wor&s;hipping God in
the Family as a Hou&s;e, could not be &s;et up; Edu|cation
and In&s;truction of Children was all de|&s;troy'd;
Example to Servants and Inferiours all
&s;poil'd; nothing could be of Religion, but what
was meerly per&s;onal and retir'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>There indeed you are right, Niece.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>I a&s;&s;ure you, Madam, from my Experi|ence,
that next to the having the Husband and
Wife be religious, or at lea&s;t religiou&s;ly inclined,
they that would have a religious Family, &s;hould
take as much Care as po&s;&s;ible to have religious Ser|vants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I agree with you in that, my Dear, with
all my Heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to pre&s;erve the nece&s;&s;ary

given on that Account.</P>

where we left off.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>There was as much Religion in our Hou&s;e,
as it was po&s;&s;ible there &s;hould be, in our Circum|&s;tances;
for both of us de&s;ired it in general, and
pur&s;ued it in particular, only we could not joyn in
the Manner; and it was a perfect Scene of Con|fu&s;ion,
to &s;ee how Religion was carry'd on among
<PB N="281" REF="287">
us; the Servants were &s;ome Papi&s;ts, &s;ome Prote|&s;tants,
&s;ome Pagans; for we had three <HI>Ea&s;t-Indian
Blacks</HI> and one <HI>Negro</HI> among our People: The
Chri&s;tian Servants were every now and then toge|ther
by the Ears about per&s;wading the Negro to
turn Chri&s;tian, and be baptiz'd, but could not bear
to think which &s;ort of Chri&s;tian the poor Creature
&s;hould be; one of our Men, an <HI>Italian,</HI> would
have him be a Papi&s;t, and the other would have
him be a Prote&s;tant; and the poor Negro was &s;o
confounded between them, that he could not tell
what to do: The Negro was a &s;en&s;ible inqui&s;itive
Fellow, and had by meer asking Que&s;tions on
both &s;ides, gotten a great deal of Knowledge of
Religion; but was meerly &s;top'd in his Search af|ter
farther Particulars by the impertinent Quarrels
of tho&s;e Servants who pretended to in&s;truct him:
Both told him he mu&s;t believe a God, a future
State, a Heaven, a Hell, a Re&s;urrection to Life,
or to Death, and that he mu&s;t be &s;aved by a Re|deemer:
They agreed exactly in their De&s;cription
of the Joys of eternal Life, the Torments of Hell,
and particularly they had joyned in giving the poor
Negro a frightful Apprehen&s;ion of Hell, as the
Reward of his doing wickedly, and of the Devil as
a Tempter, an Enemy and Tormentor; &s;o that the
poor Fellow would pray to God very heartily to
&s;ave him from Hell, and to keep him from the
Devil.</P>
</SP>
<P>But when the&s;e poor ignorant Fellows began to
in&s;truct him how to wor&s;hip God, and who to look
to as his Redeemer and Saviour; to talk to him
about reading the Scriptures, and &s;uch Things,
they fell out to the la&s;t Degree; the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Foot|man
told the <HI>Italian</HI> he was an Idolater, and that
was wor&s;e than a Heathen; that <HI>Negum,</HI> (<HI>for &s;o the
poor Negro was called</HI>) was as good a Chri&s;tian as he,
<PB N="282" REF="288">
for tho' he did not wor&s;hip in the Name of Chri&s;t,
yet as he, (<HI>the Italian Footman</HI>) wor&s;hip'd a piece of
Wood for a Saviour, Chri&s;t would not accept him;
and it was as bad as <HI>Negum</HI>'s wor&s;hipping a Hob-Goblin,
or any Thing el&s;e. The <HI>Italian</HI> told him,
he was a Heretick, and his Religion was no Reli|gion
at all; that he was an Enemy to God, and
to the Church; and told <HI>Negum,</HI> that if he be|liev'd
what that Fellow &s;aid, the Devil would take
him away alive. They had many Quarrels about
it; but one Day above the re&s;t they came to that
height, that they fell to fighting; it &s;eems, the
re&s;t of the Servants had parted them before their
Ma&s;ter or I heard of it; but as we were both walk|ing
together in the Evening in our Garden, we by
meer chance &s;aw the Negro in the Kitchin-Garden
crying: His Ma&s;ter &s;aw him fir&s;t, and called him
to us; and the Fellow came with a Book in his
Hand, but terribly afraid his Matter &s;hould be
angry.</P>

a Prote&s;tant, I am &s;ure you won't de&s;ire him to be
a Catholick; and &s;o the poor Fellow mu&s;t be lo&s;t:
<HI>I told him,</HI> it was a critical Ca&s;e, in which I knew
not how to act; but as they were his Servants in
particular, and shat he brought this <HI>Negro</HI> out of
<HI>Italy</HI> with him, I thought they were to be at his
Di&s;po&s;al and Direction rather than mine: My

yours; don't &s;hift it off &s;o, but tell me what &s;hall
I do? I confe&s;s I trembled when he &s;aid &s;o; for I
was afraid &s;ome Debate would fall in between us,
in Con&s;equence of the Ca&s;e; however I an&s;wer'd
him thus; My Dear, you determined before for
me, what you might be &s;ure would be my
Thoughts; but what can I determine about your
Servants? Well, my Dear, &s;ays he, I'll do as <HI>So|lomon</HI>

be taught at all.</P>

&s;ent the Negro down to a Country Tenant we

&s;ow, and do Country Work, and there I kept
him near a Twelvemonth; at the &s;ame time the

having a Hint from me what to do, this poor Ne|gro

be a Prote&s;tant, than remain a Heathen, or lo&s;e
all de&s;ire of being a Chri&s;tian, for, &s;ayshe, God
can inlighten him farther by a Miracle, when he
plea&s;es; and then having been taught the general

<HEAD>PART III.</HEAD>
<P>_IN the latter Part of the la&s;t, Di&s;|cour&s;e
we left the Aunt and the
Widow Si&s;ter, who had marry'd
the Roman Catholick Gentleman,
entring upon a Di&s;cour&s;e about the
Inconveniencies of entertaining ir|religious
Servants; and al&s;o of en|tertaining
of Servants of differing Per&s;ua&s;ions and
Opinions in Religion, one from another, or of dif|ferent
Opinions from the Family they &s;erv'd in.
The Ladies put off the Di&s;cour&s;e of that Affair
for another Time, the Aunt being willing to en|ter
into a more particular Conver&s;ation about it,
This cau&s;ed &s;everal very entertaining Di&s;cour&s;es
<PB N="290" REF="295">
mong them at &s;everal times, &s;ome of which, I
hope, may be u&s;eful to be made publick. for the
Direction of other Families, and for the Encou|ragement
of all Ma&s;ters or Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of Families,
who de&s;ire to promote good Government and re|iligious
Things among their Children and Servants,
and particularly in &s;uch a Time as this, when 'tis
known that Servants are le&s;s apt to &s;ubmit to Fa|mily
Regulations, and good Hou&s;hold Govern|ment
than ever.</P>
<P>The two Ladies being at their Aunt's Hou&s;e,
which was at <HI>Hamp&s;tead,</HI> as I have ob&s;erved, their
Aunt had a little Squabble with one of her Maids
upon the following Occa&s;ion: The Maid had, it
&s;eems, been out in the Afternoon of a Sabbath-day,
and &s;taid longer than the u&s;ual time of being
at Church h and her Lady, who otherwi&s;e had
known nothing of it, happen'd unluckily for the
Wench to be ju&s;t in the way when &s;he came in,
that is to &s;ay, the Lady chancing to go down the
Back-&s;tairs, which was not ordinary for her to do,
meets her Maid dre&s;t in her be&s;t Cloaths, and
ju&s;t going up to undre&s;s her&s;elf; and this Rein|counter

it, &s;he won't keep you an Hour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, &s;he may do as &s;he will for that; I
told her plainly where I went, and that I thought
&s;he had nothing to do with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you &s;o, <HI>Mary?</HI> Then I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he told
you her mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, and I told her my mind too: I
won't be tied up to her religious Trumpery, not
I; if I do her Work what has &s;he to do with
what Religion I am of, or whether I have any
Religion, or no? 'tis no Bu&s;ine&s;s of hers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, <HI>Mary,</HI> I cannot go that Length nei|ther:
I think my Mi&s;tre&s;s may concern her&s;elf
with that; for it &s;he is religious her&s;elf, &s;he may
de&s;ire to have her Servants be &s;o too; and there|fore
if I do make a Breach &s;ometimes, I always
do it &s;o, as not to be found out; and I have had
&s;uch good Luck, that my Mi&s;tre&s;s has never
caught me yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well &s;he has caught me; and if it be a
fine Day next Sunday, &s;he &s;hall catch me a|gain,
if &s;he has a mind to it; I won't be ty'd
to go to Church but when I plea&s;e; I love Liber|ty:
Be&s;ides; this is about Religion, <HI>Betty,</HI> and &s;o
'tis Liberty of Con&s;cience; you know I love Li|berty
of Con&s;cience, <HI>Betty.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="297" REF="302">
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are witty upon it, <HI>Mary:</HI> Pray what
do you call Liberty of Con&s;cience?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! that I &s;hould have Liberty to go to
Church, or not to go to Church, as I think fit,
and when I plea&s;e; is not that Liberty of Con|&s;cience?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, <HI>Mary,</HI> I think that is Liberty without
Con&s;cience; for 'tis a Liberty in what we &s;hould
not do; that can never be Liberty of Con&s;cience,
<HI>Mary.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well; then let it be Liberty with|out
Con&s;cience; 'tis the Liberty I love; and I &s;ee
no Harm in it: Why you acknowledge you do
&s;o your &s;elf don't you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true, &s;o I do &s;ometimes; but I can|not
&s;ay 'tis as it &s;hould be; I cannot &s;ay as you do,
that there is no Harm in it; 'tis a Fault, I know
that; and I don't do it very often; and when I
do, as I told you, I take care not to have it known.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, then you are wor&s;e than I;
for you believe 'tis a Fault, and yet you do it:
Now I don't think 'tis a Fault at all, if I did,
it may be, I would not do it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't believe you can &s;ay with a &s;afe
Con&s;$$ence, that there is no Harm in it; you
only are harden'd a little more than I.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be &s;o; <HI>and you are even with me;</HI> for
you are a little more of a Hypocrite than I, and
for ought I &s;ee that's all the Difference between
us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, <HI>Mary,</HI> your Reproof is bitter; but
perhaps 'tis too true; and I &s;hall learn &s;o much
from you, that I &s;hall take more care how I do a|gain
what my own Con&s;cience convinces me is a
Fault.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="298" REF="303">
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and I may go on, becau&s;e I have

you mean.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not &s;ay &s;o; I believe you know 'tis a
Fault as well as I do, but you are a little more
us'd to tho&s;e Things, it may be, than I have been.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am as I was bred, and &s;o, it may be, are
you; I was never taught to lay much &s;tre&s;s upon
the&s;e Things, and &s;o I never trouble my &s;elf a|bout
them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, <HI>Mary,</HI> I am glad you think I have
been taught better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why as well as you have been taught, I
find you can take a Walk in the Fields a Sunday as
well as I.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I tell you again, I don't do it and
think there's no Harm in it, as you do; and I
think you have touch'd me &s;o Home with your
Reproof, that I re&s;olve never to do &s;o again while
I live.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what's all this to my Mi&s;tre&s;s and me?
What has &s;he to do with it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, <HI>Mary,</HI> my Mi&s;tre&s;s is a very pious
religious Lady, and &s;he thinks her&s;elf bound to call
her Servants to an Account how they &s;pend their
Time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, &s;o &s;he may for all the Week-days, for
that's her Time, but Sunday's my own, &s;he has
nothing to do with that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>I a&s;&s;ure you my Mi&s;tre&s;s will not allow that
Doctrine; &s;he thinks &s;he has as much to do with
you a Sunday as any other Day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>You talk of my Mi&s;tre&s;s being a religious
Lady, why &s;o &s;he may be, for ought I know; and
I think we have &s;o much Religion at Home, we
need not go abroad for it; Does not the Chap|lain
teaze us twice a day with his long Prayers,
<PB N="299" REF="304">
and reading of Chapters; I am &s;ure he has made
me neglect my Bu&s;ine&s;s many times to come in to
Prayers; but I give them the &s;lip &s;ometimes, and
if I did not, they would have many a good Di&s;h
of Meat &s;poil'd, &s;o they would.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are a merry Girl, <HI>Mary,</HI> when you
talk of Religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I don't under&s;tand it; I know no|thing
of the Matter; I come to do my Bu&s;ine&s;s,
and mind the Kitchen; if their Dinners are not
well di&s;h'd up, they may find fault, and I &s;hould
take &s;ome Care to mend it; but talk to me about
Religion, 'tis time enough hereafter, let them let
me alone to my &s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>But my Mi&s;tre&s;s will &s;atisfy you, that &s;he
is obliged, while &s;he keeps you for a Servant, to
&s;ee that you &s;erve God as well as you &s;erve her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>O dear! let them &s;erve God them&s;elves bet|ter
fir&s;t; I don't &s;ee that any of them have any
more regard to their Prayers and their Chapters
than I have that &s;tay away, but only for Form
&s;ake, and it may be for the Credit of employing a
Chaplain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, do not &s;ay &s;o neither; I can a&s;&s;ure
you my Mi&s;tre&s;s is a very pious religious Lady, and
you cannot &s;ay otherwi&s;e I am &s;ure, and &s;o are all
the young Ladies too, they are like her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be &s;o; and yet I have &s;een them all
a&s;leep at Prayers many a time, when I am &s;ure
they had not &s;o much more need to be &s;leepy than
I had, that work hard, nor &s;o much neither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sometimes they may be heavy, but that is
not often; and I &s;uppo&s;e you cannot &s;ay they
were ever all a&s;leep together.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis no matter for that, they do the &s;ame
at Church; and pray what's the difference between
my going to the Fields to take my Plea&s;ure a Sun|days,
<PB N="300" REF="305">
and their going to Church $o take their
Ea&s;e? between my wa&s;hing my Di&s;hes, while the
Chaplain is at Prayers, and their being fa&s;t a&s;leep
at Prayers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, <HI>Moll,</HI> thou art very malicious to take
notice of &s;uch Things, and they are Faults to be
&s;ure, but there is a va&s;t Difference in them too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>As how pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why thus: That tho' they may &s;ometimes
drop a&s;leep, 'tis not always; and they do it but
&s;eldom; you it &s;eems make the t'other a Prac|tice,
and do it always; then if they do &s;leep &s;ome|times
at Church or at Prayers, they don't pretend
to &s;ay there is no Harm in it, they mu&s;t ac|knowledge,
they ought not to do &s;o, but you
have the Impudence to &s;ay, when you &s;pend your
Time in the Fields, or perhaps wor&s;e, there is no
Harm in it: Now there's a great deal of difference
between doing a Thing which they acknowledge
to be wrong, and doing what is really wrong,
and ju&s;tifying it as if it was right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, let them do what they will, and
let me do what I will; I don't meddle with them,
let them let me alone, can't they?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it may be my Mi&s;tre&s;s thinks &s;he ought
to govern her Servants in religious Things, as
well as in her Hou&s;e-Affairs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why let her think what &s;he will, and do
what &s;he will, I will have my own Way, I &s;hall
mind nothing they &s;ay to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's none of my Bu&s;ine&s;s, <HI>Mary;</HI> you
mu&s;t do as you will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; and 'tis none of her Bu&s;ine&s;s neither,
I think.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't &s;ay that, <HI>Mary;</HI> I think, if you
were a Mi&s;tre&s;s, and kept a great many Servants,
as our Mi&s;tre&s;s does, you would talk otherwi&s;e
<PB N="301" REF="306">
and do otherwi&s;e too, or el&s;e you would &s;oon
have a Hou&s;e fall of Whores and Rogues.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know what I &s;hould do then, nor
do I trouble my Head with it; for I am never
like to be tried with it; but if I was a Hou&s;e|keeper,
and kept Maids, I would take care they
&s;hould do my Bu&s;ine&s;s, and that would keep them
from making &s;uch a di&s;orderly Hou&s;e as you &s;peak
of; as for their Religion, I &s;hould not trouble
my &s;elf about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but I would trouble my &s;elf about
that too, I a&s;&s;ure you, if I were a Mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why what would you do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why if I had a Chaplain or a Husband
that kept up good Orders in his Hou&s;e; I would
take care my Servants &s;hould always attend at
Prayers; and on Sundays I would take care they
&s;hould all go to Church, and come Home again
too when Church was done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>You would! and if I was your Maid, you
would make me come in to Prayers every Night
and Morning would you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes I would, or you &s;hould not live with
me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and if I did come in, I &s;hould on|ly
laugh at you all when I did, and make a je&s;t
of your Chaplain or your Husband, and &s;o would
other Servants too; Don't you &s;ee we do &s;o here?
An't we always a making Sport at our poor dull
Thing call'd a Champlain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I can't &s;ay but I &s;ee it, but I never
joyn with you in it; for I think there's no je&s;t at
all in it; and as for the poor good Man him&s;elf,
I know he &s;ees it, and 'tis a great Trouble and
Di&s;couragement to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="302" REF="307">
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what is &s;uch a Fellow good For, but
to be gam'd and made Sport with? Does he think
we take him for any thing but a religious Merry
Andrew?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mu&s;t think however my Mi&s;tre&s;s takes
him otherwi&s;e, and thinks it her Duty to keep him,
and to have good Orders in her Hou&s;e; and it
does not become us that are Servants to mock at
&s;uch Things; no Matter or Mi&s;tre&s;s that knew
their Servants mock'd at God's Wor&s;hip in their
Hou&s;e, ought to keep tho&s;e Servants an Hour
longer in their Families.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you would make me come to Church
if I was your Cook, would you <HI>Betty?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I don't &s;ay I would make you go to
Church, but you &s;hould either go to God's Wor|&s;hip,
or go about your Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well but what if I were a Di&s;&s;enter, and
did not like your Way, or did not care to go to
your Church? Or what if you were a Di&s;&s;enter,
and I did not like to go to the Meeting-hou&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly <HI>Mary,</HI> in general, I &s;ay if that
were the real Ca&s;e, I would not con&s;train you,
provided I was &s;atisfy'd you went but &s;omewhere;
but your Di&s;pute with my Mi&s;tre&s;s is between go|ing
&s;omewhere and no where, not between &s;erv|ing
God in this Manner or that Manner, but be|tween
&s;erving God &s;ome Way or other, and &s;erv|ing
him no Way at all, and that alters the Ca&s;e
mightily.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>But as to the Matter of coming to Pray|ers
at Home, it would be the &s;ame thing; for if
I were a Church-woman, and my Mi&s;tre&s;s a Di&s;|&s;enter;
or I a Di&s;&s;enter, and my Mi&s;tre&s;s of the
Church; I a Quaker, and my Mi&s;tre&s;s a Roman
Catholick; or my Mi&s;tre&s;s a Quaker, arid I a Ca|tholick,
it would be all the &s;ame thing; there
<PB N="303" REF="308">
would be the &s;ame Di&s;like and Contempt of what
was done in the Hou&s;e; I &s;hould no more like
the Cro&s;&s;es and the Ma&s;&s;es of the Papi&s;ts, the Yea
and Nay of the Quakers, and reading Prayers of
the Church, or Ex tempore Prayers of the Pre&s;|byterian,
if I was of the other Opinion, than I
now like any of them, while I declare I under|&s;tand
none of them; and &s;o all their Family-do|ings
would be but a je&s;t to me, and I'll make a
je&s;t of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why this is too true; and therefore I mu&s;t
own, that if I were a Mi&s;tre&s;s of a Hou&s;e, I would
always have my Servants go to the &s;ame Place, to
&s;erve God, as I did my &s;elf, or I would not keep
them; whether I went to the Church, or to the
Meeting-Hou&s;e; to the Quakers Meeting, or to
the Ma&s;s-hou&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what would you be the better? They
would but make a je&s;t of you &s;till; they would
be not the more of your Opinion for forcing them
to go where you went.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mi&s;take me much; I mean they &s;hould
be &s;uch as by Choice went to wor&s;hip &s;o before
they came to me, and that declared their Opini|on
to be &s;o when I hir'd them; for otherwi&s;e, I
grant that compelling them afterwards would be
nothing at all, or perhaps wor&s;e than the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what if an hone&s;t plain Wench like
me came to be hir'd, that knows nothing at all of
Religion, and troubled not her&s;elf about it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why &s;uch a one, when I ask'd her whe|ther
&s;he went to this or that Place, would &s;ay yes
to any of them as I happen'd to be my &s;elf, and
&s;o I might be deceived.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well and what would you do then, when
you found her out, and met her on the Back|&s;tairs,
<HI>Be&s;s,</HI> as my Mi&s;tre&s;s has done by me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="304" REF="309">
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I &s;hould do ju&s;t as my Mi&s;tre&s;s has
done with you, enquire about it, and when I found
you a reprobate prophane Wench, and a fa$cy one
too, as it &s;eems you acknowledge you have &s;hown
your &s;elf to Day, I &s;hould e'en give you warning to
mend your Manners, or provide your &s;elf, as it
&s;eems my Mi&s;tre&s;s has done too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>A pretty Story! &s;o I am come to make my
Complaint to you to fine purpo&s;e; for it &s;eems
you think me in the wrong all the way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed &s;o I do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what if I had came to you to be hir'd,
and you had ask'd me my Opinion about Religion,
and I had an&s;wer'd you, that I had not had ma|ny
Thoughts about it, that all Opinions were a
like to me; that when I did go any where, I
would go where you would have me go, and the
like.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, <HI>Mary,</HI> I mu&s;t own I &s;hould not like
it at all; neither I believe, &s;hould I hire you at
all; I &s;hould be afraid to take &s;uch a &s;tupid De|&s;pi&s;er
of God and Religion into my Hou&s;e, you
&s;hould e'en go without a Mi&s;tre&s;s of me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and you might go without a Ser|vant
too of me; for I can tell you there are Mi|&s;tre&s;&s;es
enough in the World that never ask the
Que&s;tion either before or after, nor care whether
their Servants &s;erve God or the Devil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, <HI>Mary,</HI> and that is one Rea&s;on, why
&s;o many of us Servants are of the &s;ame kind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, I don't doubt however bat I
&s;hall get a Place among them, and not be que&s;ti|on'd
about going to Church: I go to Service to
work, not to learn my Catechi&s;m; I under&s;tand
my Cookery, what is it to them whether I under|&s;tand
Religion, or no.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="305" REF="310">
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, look you, <HI>Betty,</HI> I don't learn my
Catechi&s;m any more than you, and yet I do not
like my Mi&s;tre&s;s the wor&s;e, I a&s;&s;ure you, for taking
Care that her Servants &s;hould go to Church, and
not caring to keep tho&s;e that are De&s;pi&s;ers of Re|ligion.
I think 'tis a Pity any Lady that is religious
&s;hould not have religious Servants about them.</P>
</SP>
<P>They had another Dialogue upon this Subject
afterwards: But it had too much Pa&s;&s;ion in it to
merit a Place in this Account; for the Ca&s;e was
this; <HI>Betty</HI> gave her Lady an Account of &s;ome
Part of <HI>Marry</HI>'s Di&s;cour&s;e, particularly that of ma|king
a Je&s;t of her Chaplain, and of her calling
the Family to Prayers; upon which her Mi&s;tre&s;s
turn'd her out of her Hou&s;e, giving her a Month's
Wages in&s;tead of a Month's Warning, as one not
fit to be allow'd to &s;tay in her Family; and <HI>Mary</HI>
fell upon her Fellow Servant for that Part, in a
great Rage: <HI>Betty</HI> told her in &s;o many Words,
&s;he thought her &s;elf obliged to mention it, tho'
it was not till her Mi&s;tre&s;s having heard that they
had di&s;cours'd together, made her promi&s;e to give
her a full Account of all that had pa&s;s'd between
them, and if &s;he had not done it faithfully, would
have put them both away together</P>
<P>The&s;e two &s;hort Dialogues or Di&s;putes about the
Maid's rambling on the Sabbath-Day, was the
Rea&s;on why the young Lady's Aunt was willing
to di&s;cour&s;e again with her Neice upon that Sub|ject;
and accordingly meeting together &s;ome Time
after, they renewed their Di&s;cour&s;e about Servants
in the following manners.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think <HI>Neice,</HI> when you and I talk'd la&s;t,
we were upon the Subject of taking religious Ser|vants;
I want to hear what you have to &s;ay upon

<P>Truly Madam; it is what I lay a great
Stre&s;s upon; and tho' I have not had much Occa|&s;ion
to complain in the few Years I have kept
Hou&s;e; yet I have &s;een &s;o much of it in my Mo|ther's
Time, and &s;ince that in other Families, and
a little in my own, that I am re&s;olved whatever
Shift I make, I will have no Servants, but &s;uch as
at lea&s;t, have a common Reverence for Religion
and for Religious Per&s;ons in a Family. To be &s;ure
I will never have any Scoffers and Mockers of Re|ligion
if I can help it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>As the World goes now, Child, it will
be very hard to find &s;uch; for Religion is &s;o much
made a Je&s;t of among Ma&s;ters, that it is hard to
find any Servants that do not je&s;t at it too, and
mock and &s;light all tho&s;e that have any Regard
to it.</P>

<P>Another mi&s;chief, Child! there are in|numerable
Family Mi&s;chiefs in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe &s;o, Madam. But this is one par|ticular
Ca&s;e, and which I have the greater Rea&s;on
to take Notice of, becau&s;e a certain Lady, an Ac|quaintance
and Neighbour of mine has had a great
deal of that Kind. And indeed in a particular
manner with her Servants.</P>

if I remember right, the la&s;t Time you did
me the Favour to dine with me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I remember it very well; and we talk'd a
little upon that very Subject; I mean, how rude
and in&s;olent Servants were grown at this Time;
<PB N="307" REF="312">
but I think we had not much Talk of their being
irreligious and profane.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, &s;he had a Servant, whom they
call'd <HI>her Woman;</HI> for &s;he was one to whom &s;he
entru&s;ted every Thing, and who was like a Hou&s;e|keeper;
and all the Servants were, as it were,
under her: She was a very good Sort of a Body
indeed, in the Hou&s;e; and as that Lady, if you re|member,
was very lame, &s;o &s;he could not &s;tir about
to look much after her Servants her &s;elf, and tru&s;t|ed
all to this Woman.</P>
</SP>
<P>She was a &s;en&s;ible Woman, had the knowledge of
almo&s;t every Thing in the World: and talk'd ad|mirably
well; had a World of Wit and Humour,
very mannerly and well behav'd, &s;ober and mo|de&s;t
enough; In &s;hort &s;he was an excellent Servant.</P>

Neice, I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>In a Word, Madam, &s;he had every Thing
about her, that could be de&s;ir'd in a Servant hut
Religion; and of that &s;he was as entirely empty
as you can imagine po&s;&s;ible for any Creature in
the World co be, that had ever heard of God or
Devil, or had liv'd among Chri&s;tians.</P>
</SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>No indeed, Madam, &s;he was &s;o far from
being ignorant, that &s;he was able co deceive any
Body: She would talk of religious Things as well,
and argue upon them &s;trongly, enough to delude
any Body; and this made it the wor&s;e, for &s;he
was &s;uch a human Devil, that &s;he made u&s;e of a
fluent Tongue and of an uncommon&punc; Wit&punc; not to
talk religiou&s;ly, but to mock and make a Je&s;t of
Religion, and of all tho&s;e that had any Regard
for it.</P>

<P>She had never been marry'd, Madam, but

wicked, prophane, and athei&s;tical Behaviour is e|nough

he know it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes Madam, he knows more of it than
&s;he does; for the Men Servants tell him of it,
and give him a particular Account &s;ometimes of
Pa&s;&s;ages which they ob&s;erve.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps he don't trouble him&s;elf about it:
For the Men do not often value the&s;e Things.</P>

<P>Indeed Madam, ju&s;t the contrary; for

very good Orders in his Hou&s;e, and 'tis a very
great Di&s;turbance to him.</P>

<SP>

<P>And has he &s;poken of it to his Wife?</P>
</SP>

<PB N="309" REF="314">

<P>I know not indeed how &s;he manages;

more Words about it, than about all other matters
put together, &s;ince they were marry'd; and &s;ome|times
it grows high, and they are very warm and
even angry about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, &s;he &s;eems to be a good &s;en&s;ible re|ligious

Part, e&s;pecially again&s;t her Husband?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Fir&s;t of all &s;he pretends that &s;he
does not believe it; that the other Servants rival
her the Favours &s;he receives, and her Mi&s;tre&s;s's parti|cular
Kindne&s;&s;es, and do it out of a malicious De&s;ign;
then &s;he &s;ays &s;he has examin'd her, and &s;he finds
&s;he clears her &s;elf of much of the Charge, and
makes the re&s;t appear to be trifling, and not worth
Notice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>But perhaps <HI>Neice,</HI> it really may be &s;o too,
and the other Servants may make Things wor&s;e
than they are, for the Rea&s;ons you mention.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice</SPEAKER>
<P>But Madam, it is otherwi&s;e in Fact; for
the Truth is, this Wench or Woman, manages all
the Servants &s;o effectually, that in &s;hort, if any
of them are religiou&s;ly enclin'd when they come,
&s;he makes them a&s;ham'd to be &s;o, when they
come to Her, for &s;he makes &s;uch a Mock of Re|ligion,
and &s;uch a Je&s;t of going to Church, or
going to Prayers in the Family, that &s;he laughs
them out of their Religion, and in a Word, they
all turn Reprobates like her &s;elf.</P>

is an excellent Servant, and the more her Mi&s;tre&s;s is

<P>But does he know nothing from his own
Knowledge?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Yes, Madam, he knows too much; for
the unwary Creature let him over-hear her one
Evening, making her Jeers, and flout at him to
&s;ome of the Servants, but behind his Back, for his
calling them all to Prayers; and not only &s;o, but at
&s;ome Expre&s;&s;ions which he had u&s;ed &s;ome Time or
other, which &s;he pretended were Non&s;ence, and
others trifling, and the like, as the Redundancy
of her Wit gave her Room to banter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was very unhappy indeed, and the
wor&s;e that he &s;hould know it too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it was, Madam; for it made the
poor Gentleman decline performing his Duty for
&s;ome Time, and made a very great Breach be|tween
him and his Lady, which is hardly quite
made up yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why &s;o pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why Madam, &s;he wanted to have him
continue to go on with his Duty, and to pray
in his Family as he us'd to do: He declar'd he
could not do it while that Creature was to be
there; that it was a Re&s;traint to him, and he
could not perform when he knew there was one
in the Place who made a Scoff and Jeer at him
for it. She alledg'd he ought to perform his Du|ty
for all that; and that it was a Piece of the
Devil's Craft, contrived to interrupt the Wor&s;hip of
God in his Family, and that he ought to di&s;re|gard
it entirely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="311" REF="316">
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I think, he was very much in the
wrong in that Part, for he certainly ought not
to have omitted his Duty upon &s;o mean an Obje|ction
as that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is true, and he owned it; but &s;aid
it was a Difficulty upon him, a Re&s;traint to him
in the Performance of his Duty, and that &s;he
ought to remove it for him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>He ought to have con&s;ider'd that the le&s;s
of Religion was to be found in his Servants, the
more Rea&s;on he had to pray For them, and with
them, that he might perhaps be the Occa&s;ion of
Good to them, and of bringing them to the Know|ledge
and Love of Religion, which would be an
Advantage he ought to be thankful for, and think.
it a Ble&s;&s;ing to his Hou&s;e if it happened &s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>She did argue ju&s;t &s;o to him, Madam: But
he return'd it &s;o &s;trong upon her, that &s;he ought
as far as lay in her, to remove every Difficulty that
lay in the Way of his Duty; that it was much
more forcible as to her; for he told her, that if
&s;he granted, that the Difficulty was a Snare laid in
his Way by the Devil, &s;he ought at the &s;ame time
that &s;he told him it was his Duty to re&s;i&s;t it, do all
&s;he could po&s;&s;ible, or that lay in her Power, to
remove the Occa&s;ion; otherwi&s;e &s;he made her
&s;elf acce&s;&s;ary to the Temptation, and a&s;&s;i&s;tant to
the Devil, in laying a Snare for her Husband, and
much of the Sin wou'd lie at her Door.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>There was a great deal in that; I confe&s;s,
and I think &s;he ought to have yielded immediate|ly.
Pray, what did &s;he &s;ay to it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>She in&s;i&s;ted, that the Charge was fal&s;e;
that her <HI>Woman</HI> deny'd it, and as I &s;aid before, that
it was a malicious De&s;ign of the other Servants; but
in &s;hort, the Bu&s;ine&s;s was, that &s;he was very loth to
<PB N="312" REF="317">
part with tier <HI>Woman,</HI> who, as I &s;aid before, was a
very good Servant, and u&s;eful to her divers Ways.</P>

it him&s;elf. Surely &s;he would believe him then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, &s;he could &s;ay nothing to that in|deed,
but &s;he put it off as well as &s;he could, with
telling him, &s;he wou'd tell her Woman of it, and
take Care &s;he &s;hould do &s;o no more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>

was in a matter of &s;uch Con&s;equence as ought
not to be trifled with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was &s;o: But he went yet further; he
entreated her, he begg'd of her to take away a
Thing &s;o irk&s;om, from him, and which was &s;o
much a Hindrance to his Duty: He told her, that
had a Servant been a meer ignorant untaught Crea|ture,
he &s;hould have had no Difficulty upon him,
but rather it would be an Encouragement to do
his Duty, in Hopes of being an In&s;trument of
opening their Eyes: But for a Mocker at Religi|on,
and one that not only de&s;pis'd Religion it
&s;elf, but mock'd at others for it; This made the
Ca&s;e differ exceedingly, and he knew not how
to get over it.</P>

bad many Ways. For <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> it kept the Lady and
her Husband in very ill Terms with one another
for near two Years; and <HI>Secondly,</HI> That unhappy

with her <HI>Woman,</HI> he took &s;o much upon him, as to
force her out of the Hou&s;e, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> he put

&s;aid to them at Church, or in the Family, that
had any thing &s;erious in it, into Banter and Ridi|cule,
and laugh'd them out of every thing that
look'd like Religion. She repre&s;ented Religion to
be a meer Piece of State-Policy and Prie&s;tcraft,
contrived between the Clergy and the State&s;men,
<PB N="314" REF="319">
only to &s;ubject the World to their Management:

preach Salvation to a loft World, by a glorious
but crucify'd Redeemer, &s;he de&s;pis'd with the low|e&s;t
or la&s;t Degree of Contempt; calling them Mer|canaries
and Trade&s;men, the Church their Idol,
and the Pulpit their Shop, where they &s;old what
they call'd the Word of God to <HI>who bid mo&s;t,</HI> and
&s;uch like horrid and bla&s;phemous Stuff. When the
hone&s;t Servants would have gone to Church with
their Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;he would carry them
away into the Fields, or to make &s;ome Vi&s;it or
other, and continually turn them off from what
was religious to &s;omething of Levity and Diver|&s;ion,
as a more &s;uitable Work for the Sabbath-Day;
and &s;till when &s;he had brought them to
break in upon Con&s;cience, and to prophane the
Sabbath-Day, &s;he would fall foul of Religion for
laying the Burthen of Rules upon the Liberties of
the World; and all &s;he did or &s;aid, was with a deal
of Wit, and by way of Sarca&s;m, as &s;harp and as

then? I doubt you don't chink much about it.</P>
<P>Not &s;o much as I &s;hould do, Madam, <HI>&s;ays the
Maid,</HI> and look'd very &s;imply and innocently at
the Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not expecting, <HI>it may be,</HI> to be ask'd
&s;uch Que&s;tions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I believe not; for they are Que&s;ti|ons
that I think, none of us ask &s;o much as we
&s;hould do, when we hire Servants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Servants value them&s;elves &s;o much now,
that they would take it as out of the way to be
ask'd about the&s;e Things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, if I have any Servants, they &s;hall
all be ask'd &s;uch Que&s;tions, and answer them too,
or they &s;hall be no Servants to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am of the &s;ame mind, Madam, if I can
po&s;&s;ibly find Servants that will &s;ubmit to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Child, if they won't &s;ubmit before they
are hired, to tell me what Religion they are of;
what are they like to &s;ubmit to, after they are
hir'd about Religions or any thing el&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why really Madam, I have had two or
three that made a great deal of Difficulty to do
it, and thought it very much out of the Way to
have me ask 'em about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="318" REF="323">
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did you take them after that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly, yes I did take two of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>And were they good for any Thing when
you had them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed they were good for very little I
mu&s;t confe&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be po&s;&s;ible indeed, that a Wench
may be a good Servant, that is not a good Chri|&s;tian;
but I mu&s;t acknowledge it is but very &s;el|dom
that it proves &s;o; but when a good Servant is
a good Chri&s;tian too, &s;uch a one is ten times the
more valuable for a Servant, as well as for her
Religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, Madam: But what &s;hall we &s;ay,
that &s;ome that are good Chri&s;tians, are neverthele&s;s
not good Servants; nay, there is a kind of a Scandal
upon tho&s;e we call religious Servants; that they
are generally &s;aucy, re&s;erv'd, and value them&s;elves
too upon it, always making Conditions with you,
and claiming Times and Liberties on Account of
religious Affairs, which are neither proper for the
Work of Religion, and perhaps not employ'd &s;o
when granted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>That brings me back to the Story I was
telling you, at lea&s;t to one Part of it.</P>

<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am &s;orry I interrupted it then. Pray
Madam, go on with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I told you that Gentlewoman my Neigh|bour
ask'd the Wench about her Religion, and
how mode&s;tly &s;he an&s;wer'd. However her Mi|&s;tre&s;s
put an End to that kind of Di&s;cour&s;e, and
&s;aid, <HI>Look ye, Sweet Heart,</HI> I &s;hall not chatechi&s;e
you too far; the Que&s;tion is, whether you have
been bred to the Church, or the Meeting-hou&s;e,
for I'll tell you before-hand, we are all Di&s;&s;enters,
and go to the Meeting.</P>

<P>No, no; &s;he was willing to let her
know fir&s;t, and &s;ee what An&s;wer &s;he would give
to it, not doubting but that if &s;he gave an An&s;wer
not founded upon Principle, &s;he &s;hould find it out.</P>

<P>Well Madam, perhaps &s;he would be any

</SP>
<SP>

<P>As to that, &s;he made her &s;elf Judge of it

<P>That's true; and &s;o between both, I

<P>No my Dear; 'twas wor&s;e than that; and

Example of a Family, where the Husband goes
one way, and the Wife another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay &s;o it was: However &s;he an&s;wer'd up|on
the whole, that &s;he was very willing to go to
the Meeting, &s;ince her Mi&s;tre&s;s de&s;ir'd it.</P>

<SP>

<P>That was to &s;ay, &s;he was perfectly in|different

Church-woman, or a Roman-Catholick, or a Jew,
or any Thing, or nothing.</P>
</SP>

did &s;he prove?</P>

<P>Why, ju&s;t as a poor uneducated ignorant
Creature would prove. She went with them to
the Meeting, but pretended to the Servants &s;he
did not like it, and &s;he had rather go to Church:
So her Mi&s;tre&s;s taking an Opportunity of talking
with her again one Day, told her what &s;he had
heard in the Hou&s;e of her, and ask'd her if &s;he had
&s;aid, that &s;he did not like going to the Meetings,
but had rather go to Church, and &s;he &s;aid, that
indeed &s;he did &s;ay &s;o, but &s;he meant nothing of
Harm.</P>
</SP>
<P><PB N="321" REF="326">
Well, <HI>&s;ays her Mi&s;tre&s;s,</HI> I never de&s;ire to offer

rather go to Church, you &s;hall go to Church, tho'
you know what you &s;aid to me, when I hir'd you,
that you were very willing to go to the Meeting.</P>
<P>That was very, true, &s;he &s;aid, and &s;he had not
&s;aid otherwi&s;e now; but &s;he &s;aid only, that &s;he
had rather go to Church: However, if &s;he pleas'd
&s;he would &s;tay at home.</P>
<P>No, no, &s;ays the Mi&s;tre&s;s, I'll have no &s;taying
at home; I will have all my Servants go to the
publick Wor&s;hip of God <HI>&s;omewhere;</HI> &s;taying at
home may be as much a mis-&s;pending the Sab|bath-Day,
as going abroad for Plea&s;ure: There|fore
go to Church, <HI>Betty,</HI> &s;ays her Mi&s;tre&s;s, by
all means; I am not &s;o much again&s;t going to
Church, as to think that they do not &s;erve and

certainly your Duty to go &s;omewhere, and mine
to oblige you to it.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was &s;poken like a Woman of very
good Principles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is a very good Sort of a Per&s;on I a&s;|&s;ure
you; and generally governs her &s;elf upon
good Principles, Principles of Ju&s;tice and of Cha|rity,
which is a great Part of Religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, pray what follow'd?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why &s;he went to Church, as &s;he &s;aid;
but in a little while her Mi&s;tre&s;s began to &s;u&s;pect
her, and once or twice &s;he betrayed her &s;elf, and
di&s;cover'd among, the Servants that &s;he had been
rambling about, but had not been at Church at
all: Upon this Su&s;picion her Mi&s;tre&s;s told her one
Day very calmly, that &s;he had &s;ome Rea&s;on to
&s;u&s;pect, that her &s;aying &s;he had rather go to Church
<PB N="322" REF="327">
than to the Meeting, was not a &s;incere Di&s;like of
one, or approving of one, more than of the other
but really a Project of her own to have the Li|berty
of &s;pending the Sabbath-Day no where; that
is to &s;ay, in running about as &s;he had been &s;uffered
to do, when &s;he was at home with her Father
and Mother.</P>
</SP>
<P>She reply'd with &s;ome Confidence, that indeed
it was not &s;o; and began to be more po&s;itive
about her having been at Church, than her Mi|&s;tre&s;s
de&s;ir'd &s;he &s;hould be, becau&s;e &s;he knew &s;he
told her what was fal&s;e: However &s;he run on,
told hee Mi&s;tre&s;s a Lye or two, which &s;he knew
to be &s;o; and in&s;i&s;ted that &s;he de&s;ired to go to
Church, becau&s;e &s;he lik'd to &s;erve God, in that
Way, better than the other; &s;o her Mi&s;tre&s;s let
it pa&s;s for that Time, and &s;he went to Church as
u&s;ual, that is to &s;ay, went where &s;he pleas'd for
&s;ome Time.</P>
<P>At la&s;t &s;he was trapp'd accidentally, and could
not get off any manner of way; for going ramb|ling
for her Plea&s;ure, with &s;ome of the Neigh|bouring
Servants, Men and Maids together, (for
by this Time &s;he had got a Gang like her &s;elf,)
and going to cro&s;s the Road about a Mile from
the Town, a young Citizen that was &s;pending the
Sabbath-Day on Hor&s;e-back, as &s;he was &s;pending
it on Foot, I mean in Plea&s;ure, coming ju&s;t up
at that Minute, his Hor&s;e &s;tarted at &s;omething, I
know not at what, and giving a Spring forward, run
again&s;t the poor Wench, beat her down, and rid
over her; then run away with the Man, and
threw him off a little farther, and hurt him too
very much.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what became of the poor Girl?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="323" REF="328">
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, &s;he was more frighted than any
thing el&s;e; but &s;he had a Kick or Brui&s;e by the
Hor&s;e on her Knee, or the Hor&s;e trod or her
Knee, &s;he could not well tell which; but by
that means, &s;he was lam'd, and could not get home
till about 8 a clock at Night, when her Mi&s;tre&s;s
coming to the Knowledge of it, &s;ent the Coach for
her, and brought her home.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then there was a full Di&s;covery in|deed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay &s;o there was; for the Neighbour's
Servants that were with her own'd where they
had been, and with who; and told hone&s;tly that
they had been at a Cake-hou&s;e to be merry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was no Crime perhaps in the Families
where they liv'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, none at all; or at lea&s;t, no Notice
was taken of it, e&s;pecially &s;ince they were only
with Neighbours, and <HI>as they call'd it,</HI> was in no
bad Company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what did &s;he do with her Maid?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, her Maid was the &s;ame; &s;he was &s;orry
for a while, and pretended &s;he would never go
abroad for Plea&s;ure again of a Sabbath-Day: But
that held but a little while; &s;he was the &s;ame
again a little while after: So her Mi&s;tre&s;s re&s;olv'd
to part with her, for &s;he two or three times en|ticed
the other Servants to go abroad with her,
and &s;till when they had been mi&s;s'd, the An&s;wer
was, they went to Church with <HI>Betty;</HI> and then
if <HI>Betty</HI> was ask'd, &s;he would lie very readily too,
and &s;ay yes. At la&s;t this camie out coo, and <HI>Betty</HI>
was call'd to an Account for it, and when &s;he
could deny it no longer, then &s;he would own it,
but promi&s;e to alter it, and do &s;o no more: At
length her Mi&s;tre&s;s, who was in a little Strait &s;till,
and loth to put any Force upon the Wench a|bout
<PB N="324" REF="329">
going to the Meeting, told her &s;he could
not bear the&s;e Things, and gave her Warning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was Time to part with her when &s;he
found &s;he &s;poil'd the re&s;t of the Servants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but the Wench, very loth to leave
good Place, came to her Mi&s;tre&s;s, and begg'd her to
let her &s;tay, and &s;he would go the Meeting, and
then &s;he Should be &s;ure &s;he did not ramble any
more on the Sabbath-Day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>So that 'twas plain &s;he would &s;erve God
any way for a good Place, and that was what I
&s;aid of her, as &s;oon as I heard her fir&s;t An&s;wer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>But her Mi&s;tre&s;s acted upon another Prin|ciple
&s;till, and &s;he refus'd her: No, &s;ays &s;he, <HI>Mary,</HI>
you declar'd in the Hou&s;e that you u&s;ed to go to
Church; that you did not like the Meetings, and
that you had rather go to Church: Now, I will
not have any body forc'd from going to Church
to plea&s;e me; if you had been one that was bred
to go the Meeting, I had been better pleas'd, be|cau&s;e
I have been &s;o brought up my &s;elf; but if
you choo&s;e to go to Church becau&s;e you like to
&s;erve God after that manner better than in the
Way I go, God forbid I &s;hould put any Force
upon you; I doubt not, but you may &s;erve and
wor&s;hip God very acceptably either way; but if
you go to the Meeting which you do not like,
only to keep your Place which you do like, 'tis
plain to me you will wor&s;hip God no where, for
you cannot be &s;aid to wor&s;hip God in a Way you
do not like.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>She was too nice, I think, and talk'd to
an ignorant Wench in Language that &s;he did not
under&s;tand; &s;he might e'en ha' let her gone any
where; for 'twas plain &s;he would &s;erve God no
where.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="325" REF="330">
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, &s;he acted her own Principles how|ever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what did &s;he do with the Maid then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why &s;he made her a new Propo&s;al Look|ye
<HI>Betty,</HI> &s;ays her Mi&s;tre&s;s, if you will go to
Church hone&s;tly, and &s;atisfy me that you do &s;o,
and that you do not, under a Pretence of going
to Church, go abroad and &s;pend your Time idly,
I &s;hall be ea&s;y; for this was all the Rea&s;on why at
fir&s;t I ask'd you where you went, and told you I, ex|pected
you &s;hould go with me; not that I am a|gain&s;t
any Body's going to the Church, but becau&s;e
I de&s;ire they &s;hould &s;erve God, and not ramble
abroad. <HI>Betty</HI> promi&s;ed heartily; Ay, but &s;ays
her Mi&s;tre&s;s, how &s;hall I be &s;atisfy'd of the Per|formance?
<HI>Betty</HI> &s;tood hard to have her Word be
taken for it; but that would not do, becau&s;e &s;he
had broke her Promi&s;e before, and had told &s;ome
Lyes too about the other Servants going to Church
with her as above. Well <HI>Betty, &s;ays her Mi&s;tres,</HI> I'll
put you in a Way to &s;atisfy me effectually: You
know the Clark of the Pari&s;h lives but ju&s;t by and in
your Way to the Church; his Wife is a very &s;ober
good Woman, and I know never fails going to
Church, if &s;he be well: Now, if you will go eve|ry
Sunday with her, I'll an&s;wer for it, that if you
are not there, &s;he will be true to me, and &s;o kind
to you, as to tell me of it, and this &s;hall &s;a|tisfy
me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>If the Clark's Wife was &s;o faithful to be
tru&s;ted it was right, but that was a doubtful thing;
for &s;he would be loth, I reckon, to ruin the poor
Wench for failing now and then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, the Short of the Story was this;
<HI>Betty</HI> was <HI>Betty</HI> &s;till; an ill Habit and Want of
Principle led her away; &s;he &s;eldom came to Church,
and the Clark's Wife would not lie for her, and
<PB N="326" REF="331">
&s;o at la&s;t her Mi&s;tre&s;s turn'd her away; and thus I
think all Servants Men and Maids &s;hould be &s;erv'd,
would the Matters and Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es do their Duty;
and if this was univer&s;ally practis'd, Servants would
&s;erve God and their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es too, better than
they do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>They would &s;o indeed, and for Want
of it, they &s;erve neither God nor their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es.
'Tis a want of a religious Regard to the Well-ordering
of Servants that makes them as they are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, But I have another Story to tell
you of the &s;ame Gentlewoman; for after, this &s;he
took a Servant that &s;he thought mu&s;t nece&s;&s;ary be
religious; for &s;he was $bred to the Meetings from
her Infancy: But it &s;eems &s;he was not of the &s;ame
Sort as her Mi&s;tre&s;s; But &s;he told her where &s;he
u&s;ed to go, and capitulated for Liberty to go to the
&s;ame Meeting &s;till. This her Mi&s;tre&s;s readily con|&s;ented
to, not doubting but that one that was under
&s;uch Obligations, would certainly be careful to do
her Duty; and when &s;he mentioned to the Maid
that &s;he was very ready to yield to her going where
&s;he &s;aid &s;he went, that &s;he only de&s;ir'd to be &s;atis|fy'd
that her Servants did really go where they &s;aid
they went the Maid &s;eem'd a little &s;urpriz'd, that &s;he
&s;hould be thought capable of &s;o wicked a Thing
as that, and &s;o &s;topp'd her Mi&s;tre&s;s's Mouth with
her Character.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well Madam, then I hope &s;he had one
to her mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>At the &s;ame Time her Husband had a
Man-Servant, who was a very religious devout
Fallow, and he was a Churchman: He truly con|ditioned
that he would be at Liberty to go to
Church, which upon their being &s;atisfy'd that he
was really a well-meaning &s;ober and &s;erious Fel|low,
they ea&s;ily con&s;ented to.</P>

<P>I thought you &s;aid they in&s;i&s;ted on their
Servants going to wor&s;hip God where they did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I told you they de&s;ir'd it, but that it was
chiefly that they might be &s;ure to have orderly
Servants; and that they did ob&s;erve the Lord's
Day, and wor&s;hipped God in &s;ome Place, or other,
not mi&s;pending the Sabbath; otherwi&s;e they were
Per&s;ons of a large Charity, and of a true Chri|&s;tian
Temper to tho&s;e from whom they differ'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but to return to their Servants,
how did they prove?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only the wor&s;t that ever was heard of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! both of them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, both of them. The Wench was
&s;aucy, rigid, cen&s;orious; took upon her to find
Fault, that her Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;tre&s;s, who were
chearful and good temper'd People, were not &s;e|rious
enough; &s;he would not come in to their
Family Wor&s;hip, becau&s;e &s;he &s;aid, 'twas &s;orrily per|form'd
and &s;he did not like it: When her Mi&s;tre&s;s en|tertain'd
any Friends, &s;he did not like it, 'twas wick|ed,
and it was loo&s;e and extravagant, and had too
much Luxury in it, <HI>and the like.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>She &s;hould have been Mi&s;tre&s;s, and not
Maid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her Mi&s;tre&s;s told her &s;o indeed one Day,
when over-hearing &s;ome of her Talk by Accident.
She call'd her to her, and &s;peaking &s;omething
angrily to her, <HI>Jane, &s;ays &s;he,</HI> an&s;wer me one Que|&s;tion,
What did I hire you for? <HI>Jane</HI> was a little
&s;urprized at fir&s;t, not under&s;tanding the Que&s;tion,
and &s;aid nothing; till her Mi&s;tre&s;s repeated the
Que&s;tion by way of Explanation thus, <HI>Jane Pray
did I not hire you to do my Work, and to be my Servant?</HI></P>
</SP>
<P>Yes Madam, &s;ays <HI>Jane.</HI></P>
<P>Well then, <HI>&s;ays her Mi&s;tre&s;s,</HI> Pray do your Bu|&s;ine&s;s,
and behave like a Servant, as becomes you,
<PB N="328" REF="333">
or remove and provide your &s;elf, and when I wan$
a Schoolmi&s;tre&s;s to teach me how to behave in
my Family, I'll &s;end for you.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was right; that was acting like a
Mi&s;tre&s;s; pray, what &s;aid <HI>Jane</HI> to it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>She was confounded, and &s;truk dumb at
fir&s;t, but her Mi&s;tre&s;s explain'd it to her after|wards.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>But pray, what was &s;he for a Servant?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! a mo&s;t extraordinary accompli&s;h'd
Slattern, and a &s;urly, heavy, unmannerly Crea|ture,
that, look'd always as it &s;he thought her &s;elf
fitter to be a Mi&s;tre&s;s, than her that was &s;o; did
every Thing with Reluctance, awkwardly and di&s;|re&s;pectful,
and yet wilful, and above being taught,
dull to the la&s;t Degree, but &s;corn'd Reproof.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly &s;he had more of the Pretence
to Religion than of the Reality; for Chri&s;tianity
teaches us to fill up every Relative Duty with
equal Exactne&s;s, and with a &s;uitable Diligence and
Application.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why to bring my Story to a Point,
&s;he had the Out&s;ide of Religion only: Whether
&s;he took it up with a De&s;ign to deceive, or whe|ther
&s;he deceived her &s;elf, and fell from what &s;he
at fir&s;t profe&s;s'd, I know not; but &s;he fell quite
off from Religion it &s;elf at la&s;t, and adding to
that &s;ome Follies, which I choo&s;e to &s;ay nothing
of, my good Neighbour turn'd her off, and got
rid of her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>There &s;he was cheated in her own way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>She was &s;o, and I told her of it; but &s;he
an&s;wer'd me with a Saying which I have often
made u&s;e of before, and that with, relation to my
&s;elf; <HI>I am never,</HI> &s;aid me, <HI>in &s;o much Danger to be cheat|ed,
as when People pretend to be religious; for then I
<PB N="329" REF="334">
think they dare not do &s;uch Things as I am afraid of.</HI></P>
<P>Here the Second Si&s;ter came into the Room,
and finding what Di&s;cour&s;e they were engag'd in,
after her Re&s;pects paid to her Aunt, and to her
Si&s;ter, &s;he de&s;ir'd they would go on with their Di&s;|cour&s;e,
for that &s;he knew the Subject, and it was
what &s;he came on purpo&s;e to have her Share in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was telling your Si&s;ter, how a Lady of
my Acquaintance was cheated with two religious
Servants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Second Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>I heard the la&s;t Part, and &s;he was
a nice one indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! I have not told you one half of her
Behaviour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but Madam, how did it fare
with the Man-Servant? how did he behave?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why every Jot as ill another way: When
he &s;hould be at hand to be call'd, and when his
Ma&s;ter wanted him on any Occa&s;ion, he was gone
to Church to Prayers; and when Prayers were
done, he would often fall in as he came home at
a certain Alehou&s;e that unhappily &s;tood in the Way
home, and I think once or twice came home
drunk.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fine Things indeed for a con&s;cienci|ous
Wretch! The&s;e were religious Servants it &s;eems.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Hold Neice!</HI> Religion, No, nor any Pro|fe&s;&s;ion
or Opinion in Religion is not alter'd
one way or other, by the Mi&s;takes and Mi&s;car|riages
of tho&s;e that make a Profe&s;&s;ion of it. The
Eleven ble&s;&s;ed Apo&s;tles were not at all the wor&s;e,
or is the memory of them co be the le&s;s reverenc'd
for the twelfth being a Devil; nor mu&s;t we ex|pect
that all our Servants &s;hould be Saints, when
they are what we call religious: All People have
<PB N="330" REF="335">
Failings, Religion does not always change
Tempers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>But we &s;hould expect they &s;hould
be Chri&s;tians and Servants too. Religion ne|ver
takes away good Manners or privileges Ser|vants
from observing the due &s;pace which Nature
has put between the Per&s;on to be &s;erv'd, and the
Per&s;on &s;erving.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fir&s;t Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>The great Thing I in&s;i&s;t upon ta|king
religious Servants for, is that they may be
Examples in a Family, of Sobriety, quiet Submi&s;|&s;ion,
Diligence and Seriou&s;ne&s;s to their Fellow-Servants;
that they, may be Encouragers, not Hin|derers
of God's Wor&s;hip in the Hou&s;e; that the
whole Family may chearfully unite in &s;erving
God, and in all religious Orders; and if any ig|norant
untaught Creature is taken into the Hou&s;e,
they may be in&s;tructed and led by the Hand into
the proper Duties of a Chri&s;tian; that all the
Hou&s;e may be a Cla&s;s of Chri&s;tians, doing their
Duty in their re&s;pective Places, both from a Prin|ciple
of Ju&s;tice and of Charity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>But 'tis very rare, Neice, to find what you
&s;peak of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fir&s;t Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is &s;o Madam: But then, &s;ince it
is not probable we &s;hould always find &s;uch, all that
I in&s;i&s;t on in the mean Time, is, that we &s;hould
take Care, as near as po&s;&s;ible, to take tho&s;e that
are well enclin'd, and well educated, not Ene|mies
to all Religion, not &s;uch as make a Mock
of wor&s;hipping their Maker, or ob&s;erving his Rules;
&s;uch I would dot entertain at all, on any Account
what&s;oever; they would be a continual Offence in
a &s;ober Family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>But there are &s;ome that may be in
the middle way, no Enemies to Religion, not
mockers at all &s;ober Things, and yet not much
<PB N="331" REF="336">
&s;tor'd with &s;erious Thoughts, not void of Princi|ple,
or void of Mode&s;ty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, it is true, there are &s;ome &s;uch, and
I know not what to &s;ay to &s;uch, I would rather
have them than the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fir&s;t Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>I like tho&s;e but little better, I
would have neither of them if I could help it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, that they always di&s;cover a
Coldne&s;s and Backwardne&s;s to every good Thing,
and &s;ecretly de&s;pi&s;e the mo&s;t &s;erious Things as well
as the other; but good manners re&s;trains them a
little from in&s;ulting the Family. I do not like
&s;uch, I confe&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>But they may be better born with
Madam, than the fir&s;t &s;ort.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but your Si&s;ter here is &s;o far from
approving that &s;ort; that even if they were &s;e|riou&s;ly
religious, &s;he would not entertain them
if they were of a different Opinion; &s;he is of the
&s;ame Notion with my Cook Maid, that I told
you the Story of, that all differing Opinions in
Religion, will in &s;uch Creatures as them, de&s;pi&s;e
and contemn tho&s;e that differ, from them, and ei|her
hate or make a Je&s;t of one nother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Si&s;ter, it may be, is grown rigid
that way, from the Di&s;a&s;ter of her Family with
re&s;pect to her Husband and her &s;elf: But in car|rying
it &s;o far then, &s;he will make it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;i|ble
to have any Servants at all, but &s;uch as we
bring upon our &s;elves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fir&s;t Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is no matter for that? I am po&s;i|tive
in it with, re&s;pect to a Family's Peace, and
the Harmony of religious Wor&s;hip in a Family;
it is all de&s;troy'd and lo&s;t by the&s;e little Difficul|ties,
and as long as there are Servants to be had,
and I could pay Wages, I would change 500 Ser|vants,
till I found one so my Purpo&s;e; nor &s;hould
<PB N="332" REF="337">
any Fitne&s;s for my Bu&s;ine&s;s, or any Goodne&s;s of
Humour in a Servant, prevail with me to keep
her, if &s;he wanted the main Article of Religion, and
the &s;ame Opinion of Religion too with my own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am afraid Child, you would change
500 indeed then, before you would be fitted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fir&s;t Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why Madam, I hope I am not of
&s;uch &s;trange Principles and Opinions, that no bo|dy
can be found of tho&s;e Opinions but me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my Dear; but Servants have rarely
any Notions of tho&s;e Things, or enter far into them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fir&s;t Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well Madam, I would venture it,
for I would no more entertain tho&s;e who differ'd
from my Opinion in Religion, than I would en|tertian
tho&s;e that had none at all; for the Diffe|rence
in Opinion in Servants, has more mi&s;|chiefs
in it &s;ometimes, than the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant it would be very well to have Ser|vants
of the &s;ame Opinion in Religion with our
&s;elves, but it cannot be always &s;o; the fir&s;t and
main Point that I have made my Rule, has been to
have Servants that are religiou&s;ly enclin'd in ge|neral
and that are willing tat be in&s;tructed;
the&s;e having a mode&s;t &s;ober Behaviour in the
main are more ea&s;ily brought to comply with re|ligious
Things in the Family, whether they are
the &s;ame way that they were fir&s;t inclin'd to or
not; &s;uch as the&s;e are often brought by good
Examples in the Hou&s;e, to be of the &s;ame Opi|nion
with our &s;elves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Such, are indeed a great Tye up|on
Ma&s;ters and Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of Families to take
Care that we recommend the Profe&s;&s;ion we
make of Religion by a good Example; for Ser|vants
are not likely to turn to our Opinion, or
embrace with us the Pare which we take in Religion
when they &s;ee us not prcati&s;e the Things we pre|tend
<PB N="333" REF="338">
to teach, and not winning them to our O|pinion
by a Conver&s;ation becoming Religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very true, <HI>Neice,</HI> and would Ma|&s;ters
and Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es keep upon their Minds a &s;en&s;e
of what Influence their Conduct may have up|on
their Servants; how they may be the means
of bringing them to a &s;erious embracing of Reli|gion,
or to a greater Levity and Indifference than
it may be they had before, as they &s;ee a good
or ill example in tho&s;e they &s;erve, we &s;hould have
much better Matters and Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es than we have,
and more religious Servants too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fir&s;t Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's very true, find it were to be
wi&s;h'd it were well ob&s;erv'd. But &s;ince it is not
always &s;o, I cannot reconcile it to common Rea|&s;oning,
that we &s;hould take Servants of any Prin|ciples
or Opinion in Religion, but &s;uch as we pro|fe&s;s
our &s;elves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>If it can be avoided.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fir&s;t Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly it may be avoided if we
Will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>You would except &s;uch as being ig|norant
and untaught, profe&s;s them&s;elves willing
to come into religious Families, that they may be
guided into good Things by Teaching and Exam|ple.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fir&s;t Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I do except &s;uch; for &s;uch are
to be moulded this way or that, as Providence
ca&s;ts them into religious or irreligious Families.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>We agree in that Part exactly; and in
deed were I to chu&s;e, I would rather take a Ser|vant,
who being ignorant in religious matters,
was yet &s;ober and willing to be in&s;tructed; I &s;ay
much rather than take one fixt in his or her reli|gious
Opinion, and that Opinion differing from
my own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="334" REF="339">
<SPEAKER>Fir&s;t Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed Madam, I am po&s;itive in that
Point; I cannot go from it: I would not take one
that differ'd from me in Opinion in Religion by
any means; no, upon no Account at all; it is
attended with nothing but Confu&s;ion in the Fa|mily:
I would almo&s;t as &s;oon take a loo&s;e profane
Wretch that own'd no Religion at all: I have &s;een
&s;o much of it, and found &s;uch Inconveniences in ha|ving
religious Quarrels and Differences in the Fa|mily
by it, that I think 'tis un&s;ufferable: I told
you the Story of our poor Negro that would
turn Chri&s;tian: We had one Servant a Papi&s;t, and
he would have the Boy a <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick; ano|ther
would have him be a Church of <HI>England</HI> Pro|te&s;tant,
and another would have had him been a
Presbyterian; 'twas a Reproach even to the Name
of Chri&s;tian, to hear how one told him he would
be damn'd if he was this, another told him he
would be damn'd if he was that, and the t'other
told him he would be damn'd if he was either of
them, and &s;o of the re&s;t; &s;o that the poor Boy
was almo&s;t di&s;tracted among them, as I told you
at large before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without entring into Examples, I grant
'tis very pernicious, and a great Ob&s;truction to
Family-Religion, and that many ways.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Were there a Spirit of Peace and
Charity always to be found where there was an
outward Appearance of Religion, it would be quite
otherwi&s;e; but that is not our Ca&s;e in this Age:
You &s;ee Madam, what was the Ca&s;e in your Neigh|bour's
Family, where the religious Servants, I
mean appearingly religious, were the wor&s;t Ser|vants,
and the wor&s;t Chri&s;tians they could have
met with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not bring tho&s;e Examples to le&s;&s;en
the Value of good, &s;erious, religious Servants;
<PB N="335" REF="340">
but to hint to you the Danger there is (among
tho&s;e that call them&s;elves &s;uch) to find Hypocrites,
and al&s;o to note that Religion does not always
make a good Servant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>It ought to do &s;o, and would do &s;o,
if the Rules of Chri&s;tianity were faithfully ob|&s;erved.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it is not always &s;o, and therefore, as
I &s;ay, I would not take a Servant that was not
religious, or religiou&s;ly enclin'd; &s;o I do not &s;ay,
that I would not for the Sake of their being &s;eri|ous
and religiou&s;ly enclin'd, take a bad Servant;
for Religion does not always qualify a Servant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>No Madam, Religion does not make
them good humour'd, cleanly, active, diligent and
mannerly, and the like; it will make them faith|ful
and hone&s;t, that is in&s;eparable,, but there is
many a good Chri&s;tian that makes a bad Ser|vant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I know &s;ome of them expect we &s;hould
bear with all the re&s;t, for being what they call
religious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fir&s;t Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>And perhaps are not &s;o at Bottom
neither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, that &s;ort of them are generally o|therwi&s;e,
and put on an Appearance of Religion
only to di&s;gui&s;e them&s;elves the more dextrou&s;ly,
and the&s;e are the religious Servants that I am
apte&s;t to be deceiv'd by, but there are &s;ome of
the other too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis one of the wor&s;t Parts of a Hy|pocrite,
I think, when they &s;tudy to cover a vi|tious
Life with the Mask of Religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I think too, that it is &s;oone&s;t di&s;co|ver'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may indeed, be &s;ooner di&s;cover'd
than other Di&s;gui&s;es, becau&s;e the Levity is apt to
<PB N="336" REF="341">
break out at proper Intervals, in &s;pite of the ut|mo&s;t
Caution: But the Mi&s;chief is often done
fir&s;t, when the Di&s;covery it too late to prevent
it; and therefore upon the whole, there is a great
Ri&s;que in taking Servants, that we are not very
well a&s;&s;ur'd of, one way or other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fir&s;t Neice.</SPEAKER>

own, tis a Critical Ca&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fir&s;t Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let it be as Critical as it will, 'tis
ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to be be taken Care of, if we
will have religious Servants. 'Tis a &s;ad Thing to
have the Ma&s;ter or Mi&s;tre&s;s praying in one Part
of the Hou&s;e, and the Men and Maids &s;wearing
or railing, or laughing and jeering in another
Part of it. Next to having the Matter and Mi|&s;tre&s;s
religious, it is e&s;&s;ential to a religious Family,
to have the Servants religious too.</P>

be made &s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>'Tis but cour&s;e Work to new-mould
a Servant: As you find them, you have them ge|nerally.

<P>So they have, I a&s;&s;ure you <HI>Neice.</HI></P>
</SP>

<PB N="337" REF="342">
<SPEAKER>Fir&s;t Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>But they were originally of a doci|ble,
tractable Temper then, which is very rare
among Servants. But Madam, allow, you could
take that Task upon you, and your Application
had &s;ucce&s;s, you would not expect that every
Mi&s;tre&s;s like you, &s;hould &s;et up for an In&s;tructor of
their Servants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; but it is not &s;o hopele&s;s a thing
however, as you may imagine; for if a Girl has
any Mode&s;ty, &s;he cannot but li&s;ten a little to the
In&s;truction of tho&s;e that wi&s;h her &s;o well, and that
have &s;o little Obligation upon them to do it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fir&s;t Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why Madam, an untaught Wench
that is mode&s;t and willing to be in&s;tructed, I take,
as I &s;aid before, to be among the Number that
are fit to be taken; The very Example of a religi|ous
Family, will make her Religious al&s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Dear, you touch us all there, and
that upon a nice Point too; it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd
that it is becau&s;e there are &s;o few religious Fami|lies,
that there are &s;o few religious Servants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fir&s;t Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is true, Madam; but on the
other hand, loo&s;e prophane irreligious Servants are
a great Hindrance to the &s;etting up a religious
Family. Tho&s;e I am utterly again&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>And that is the Rea&s;on, Child, that I &s;ay
they &s;hould not be taken into our Families.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fir&s;t Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>And &s;hould be turn'd out again as
&s;oon as di&s;cover'd, and that without any Certi|ficate
given them of their good Behaviour, or
without giving them what we call a good Cha|racter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>We cannot deny them a Certificate,
Child, when they have not wrong'd or robb'd
us, the Law requires that of us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="338" REF="343">
<SPEAKER>Fir&s;t Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then Madam, the Certificate
&s;hould mention that I di&s;mi&s;s'd &s;uch a Man, or
&s;uch a Maid, for being a prophane irreligious Per|&s;on,
or for breaking the Sabbath-Day, or for not
going to Church when ordered to go there, or
for going abroad to be merry, when they &s;hould
have been at Church, and &s;uch like, as the ca&s;e
may happen to be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own there is a great deal of Rea&s;on to
do &s;o; but we are apt to think it hard to do &s;o,
and that it is taking a poor Servant's Livelyhood
from them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fir&s;t Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>But we &s;hould con&s;ider too, how
much harder it is to pu&s;h a profligate Wretch in|to
a &s;ober Family, under the Recommendation
or a fal&s;e Character. We cannot &s;ay we do Ju&s;tice
to our Neighbour, or do as we would be done
by: For &s;till I go back to what we both &s;aid be|fore,
that irreligious Servants are a great Hin|drance
to Matters and Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es in &s;etting up
religious Rules and Exerci&s;es in their Families.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, and a great Di&s;couragement in car|rying
them on, when they are &s;et up, and for
both tho&s;e Rea&s;ons I would advi&s;e all my Friends
to take no Servants that had not &s;ome Sen&s;e of
Religion upon them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>I joyn heartily with my Si&s;ter in
her Opinion, if &s;uch Servants can be had; But
what then mu&s;t be done when we get irreligious
and prophane Creatures into our Hou&s;es, and
cannot help it; or find them &s;o, when we ex|pected
the contrary?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do! my Dear! the ca&s;e is plain; we
mu&s;t not let Servants laugh us out of our Reli|gion:
We mu&s;t go on in the Way of our Du|ty,
and &s;et up the Wor&s;hip of God in the Hou&s;e;
<PB N="339" REF="344">
and as often as we find the Servants flout at it,
or contemn it, return the Contempt upon them|&s;elves,
and turn them out, but go on to perform
the Duty: Turn them all away, that pretend to
behave irreverently, or pretend to mock or &s;coff
at it; I &s;ay, turn them all away, and let it be
the &s;tanding known Rule in the Family, that all
the Servants that come may hear of it as &s;oon
as they conver&s;e in the Hou&s;e; then they will
know what they have to tru&s;t to, and will be|have
accordingly. 'Tis omitting our Duty in our
Families, not our performing it, that makes Servants
mock. When they &s;ee us religious to Day, and
wicked to morrow, they may well &s;coff; but
where &s;erious Religion is &s;teddily maintain'd in
a Family, it commands that Awe and Reverence
of Servants, that they grow religious of cour&s;e.
Thus one good Family breeds good Servants for
another, and the good Examples of a &s;ober Fa|mily
makes the Servants all &s;ober.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>I acknowledge all that: But I have not
practis'd that Part indeed, of turning them away
for their irreligious prophane Carriage when di&s;|cover'd.
I have endeavour'd to get religious Ser|vants,
but When I have found them otherwi&s;e, I
have not turn'd them off, which indeed I &s;hould
have done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>So far you are wrong, my Dear; for
why not put away a Coachman, or Chamber|maid,
as well for being wicked as idle, for being an
Offender again&s;t Heaven, as well as for being an
Offender again&s;t our &s;elves? I think the Rea|&s;oning
is every way as good.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may hold in many ca&s;es.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed <HI>Neice,</HI> I think it will hold in all
ca&s;es; and I can give you &s;ome In&s;tances where
<PB N="340" REF="345">
it has been very happily practis'd, and where
Servants knowing it before, have behav'd much
the better on that Account: But 'tis late now;

<HEAD>DIALOGUE. III.</HEAD>
<P>_A Few Days after this Lady and her two
Neices had di&s;cours'd this Point, about
Servants, the Aunt and both her Neices,
that is to &s;ay, the elde&s;t of the Si&s;ters
and the Widow had another Dialogue upon the
Subject of giving a Character to Servants, and
the Ju&s;tice that was to be done in it on one &s;ide
and on the ether, on the following Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Elde&s;t Si&s;ter had taken a very Scoundrel
idle Jade of a Servant, and that too after having
receiv'd a very good Character of her from a Gen|tlewoman
with whom &s;he had liv'd before; and &s;he
complain'd heavily of the Inju&s;tice of it, and that
&s;he had been abus'd by the &s;aid Gentlewoman,
and was telling her Tale to her Aunt, which in|troduc'd
the following Dialogue.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I find Child, you lay all the Fault of
your being di&s;appointed upon the Wench's for|mer
Mi&s;tre&s;s; you don't &s;eem to &s;ay the Maid
her &s;elf has deceived you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fir&s;t Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed <HI>Madam,</HI> I am deceiv'd both
ways; but I blame the Maid's former Mi&s;tre&s;s
mo&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why &s;o? Did not the Maid pretend to
otherwi&s;e than you find her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="342" REF="347">
<SPEAKER>Fir&s;t Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes <HI>Madam,</HI> that is true; but I did
not expect &s;o much from a Maid when &s;he came
to be hir'd: I did not expect &s;he &s;hould tell me
her own Faults.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but on the other hand, you did
not expect &s;he &s;hould tell you &s;he was able to
do what &s;he did not under&s;tand, or &s;hould under|take
what &s;he was no ways qualified to perform.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fir&s;t Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, that's true Madam: But &s;he
was willing to get into a good Place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>And to do it &s;he mu&s;t bs allow'd to
introduce her &s;elf by a Parcel of Lies and Shams,
and pretend to be what &s;he has no Pretence to,
I think that as bad as any of the re&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>I join with my Aunt in that Part.
I think the Law &s;hould have provided &s;ome Pu|ni&s;hment
for Servants, that give them&s;elves Cha|racters
they do not de&s;erve, as well as for other
Pieces of Di&s;hone&s;ty; for in &s;hort, it is a down
right Fraud, a Cheat and a Piece of Di&s;hone&s;ty,
intolerable; for Example, a Cook comes and
hires her &s;elf to me, to &s;erve as &s;uch, and when
&s;he has undertaken the Bu&s;ine&s;s, it appears &s;he
under&s;tands nothing of Cookery, and has never
been any thing but a middle Maid to wa&s;h and
&s;crub the Rooms and the like; or a Chamber|maid
offers her &s;elf, and tells me &s;he knows how
to make Manteaus, cut Hair, clear-&s;tarch, and
the like; and when it comes to the Trial, ac|knowledges
&s;he does not under&s;tand any of them,
or only this, and not that, as it happens; why
&s;hould not this Maid be puni&s;hed as well as &s;he,
that pretending to be hone&s;t, proves a Thief?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>No Child; &s;he does de&s;erve to be ill
us'd; but the Ca&s;e differs as to a Thief; for &s;he
is puni&s;h'd, not for pretending Hone&s;ty, and de|ceiving
<PB N="343" REF="348">
me in her Character, but for her actual
Theft and robbing me of my Goods.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well <HI>Madam,</HI> then the Puni&s;hment
&s;hould differ too. I do not &s;ay &s;he &s;hould be
hang'd, but I think &s;he &s;hould be puni&s;h'd how|ever
&s;ome Way or other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fir&s;t Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have Ways to puni&s;h &s;uch a
Servant, and all Servants too, if all Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es
would but be ju&s;t to them&s;elves and to one ano|ther.
We might make up the Deficiency of the
Law in that Ca&s;e to our &s;elves very ea&s;ily, and
the Want of doing our &s;elves Ju&s;tice is the Thing
I complain of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>How would you make it up?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fir&s;t Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why <HI>Madam,</HI> whenever any &s;uch
Servant came to me, I would be &s;ure to turn her
away again with all the Re&s;entment that her Be|haviour
requir'd, and when &s;he &s;ent any future
Mi&s;tre&s;s to me for a Character, I would do her
Ju&s;tice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>You &s;hould &s;ay Si&s;ter, that you
would do the Gentlewoman Ju&s;tice who came
to enquire of you about her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly you put it right there, <HI>Si&s;ter.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed <HI>Madam,</HI> that is the Foundati|on
of all the Grievance we are under about Ser|vants,
that we make no Con&s;cience of doing one
another Ju&s;tice when we make Enquiries after
the Character of one anothers Servants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fir&s;t Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why we are loth to hinder poor
Servants; for to take away their Character is to
take away their Bread.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>We may &s;ay the &s;ame of a Thief, or
a Hou&s;e-breaker, when we find them in our Hou&s;es
or Gardens, and take them even in the very Fact:
We are loth to ruin them for it; that it was Ne|ce&s;&s;ity
forc'd them to do what they did, and if
<PB N="344" REF="349">
we have them committed, they will be hang'd
or tran&s;ported; nay the Argument is &s;tronger,
becau&s;e the Injury done may have been trifling,
and the Puni&s;hment there is Lois of Life, which we
may be loth to be concern'd in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fir&s;t Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>You carry the Ca&s;e a great deal too
high Si&s;ter; I cannot think they are alike.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly Si&s;ter, I think 'tis much the
&s;ame; but of the two here is the greater Obli|gation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe I take your Notion right, <HI>Neice;</HI>
the Obligation is this; If I take the Thief, and
give him up to the Law he is undone, and his
Life mu&s;t pay for it; and 'tis a &s;ad Thing for
me to let a poor Fellow be put to Death or trans|ported
for robbing me of a Trifle. But on the
other Hand I am to con&s;ider (1.) I am oblig'd
by the Law to do it; that, it is not I that put him
to Death, but the Laws of his Country and his
own Crime is the Cau&s;e of it; and I am an Of|fender
again&s;t that very Law, and in &s;ome &s;en&s;e
a Confederate with him, at lea&s;t an Encourager
of him in his Crime if I omit it: But which is more
than that, (2.) by (my perhaps unrea&s;onable)
and indeed unju&s;t Compa&s;&s;ion, I become, ac|ce&s;&s;ary
to all the Robberies he &s;hall be guilty
of after it; becau&s;e if I had done as the Law di|rected
me, I had put him out of a Condition to
rob or injure any more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have fully explain'd my Mean|ing
<HI>Madam,</HI> and I take the Ca&s;e to be the &s;ame; I
by no means do as I ought, or as the Law directs, if
when my Neighbour taking a Servant after me,
and coming to me for a Character of her, I de|cline
&s;peaking the Truth of her, ay and the whole
Truth too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="345" REF="350">
<SPEAKER>Fir&s;t Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then no Servant would get a Place
as Servants are now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then <HI>Neice,</HI> they would be more hum|ble
and careful how they behave.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fir&s;t Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a nice Ca&s;e, and we ought to
take great Care then, that we do net injure
them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true, we ought to do them
no Wrong; but we do the Per&s;on that is to take
them an irreparable Wrong if we recommend an
ill Servant to them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, we break another Law that you have
not thought of yet; for we do not do in it as
we wou'd be done by, which is the great Chri|&s;tean
Rule.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not only &s;o, <HI>Madam,</HI> but we do as
we wou'd not be done by; for would any of us
if we go to enquire of a Servant, be told &s;he was
hone&s;t when &s;he Was a Thief? that &s;he was neat
when &s;he was na&s;ty; tite when &s;he was a Slat|tern;
diligent when &s;he was idle; quiet when &s;he
was &s;aucy; and mode&s;t when &s;he was, it may be,
a bold Hu&s;&s;y? <HI>and the like.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I ob&s;erve indeed, there is a general Back|wardne&s;s
in People whenever we go to enquire
about a Servant. A Mi&s;tre&s;s cannot be &s;uppos'd
to recommend earne&s;tly, becau&s;e it is to be granted,
that &s;he parted with the Servant for &s;omething or
other. But &s;he is therefore on the other Hand
&s;hy and backward, and will &s;ay nothing or but
little of the real Character of the Servant, be|cau&s;e
for&s;ooth, &s;he would not hinder her of a Place;
and indeed I would be very loth my &s;elf to ruin
a poor Girl, becau&s;e I did not like her; but I
do think, as you &s;ay <HI>Neice,</HI> we Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es are too
<PB N="346" REF="351">
backward to be free with one another in &s;uch
Ca&s;es.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would not only an&s;wer the End,
<HI>Madam,</HI> as to the Law part, but it would bring
Servants back to be Servants again, as they us'd
to be, and as they ought to be; for really they
can hardly be call'd Servants now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fir&s;t Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wi&s;h it was with us, in the Ca&s;e
of our Maids, as it is with the Gentlemen in the
Ca&s;e of their Men Servants, <HI>viz.</HI> that we &s;hould
be oblig'd to give Certificates to our Maids when
they went away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why even then, the Ca&s;e would be
the &s;ame; for if the Form of the Certificate was
not &s;ettled too by the Act of Parliament, we
&s;hould &s;ign any Thing they de&s;ir'd of us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fir&s;t Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay Si&s;ter, that would be our
Faults.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Why, &s;o it is our Faults now, Child, if
we give them wrong Characters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fir&s;t Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not &s;ay we &s;hould give wrong
Characters; but I &s;hould be loth to &s;ay the ut|mo&s;t
of a poor Servant, and &s;o prejudice every
body again&s;t her; perhaps what &s;he did ami&s;s
with me, &s;he might mend with another, and per|haps
what might hot plea&s;e me, another might
bear with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will put an End to all that im|mediately,
Si&s;ter: I do not mean that I &s;hould
enter into a long Accu&s;ation of a Servant, and
give the Hi&s;tory of her Life; or that I would bla&s;t
her for Trifles, or give her an ill Name for not
&s;uiting exactly to my Temper. But I &s;peak in
capital e&s;&s;ential Articles, &s;uch as denominate a
Wench a good or a bad Servant, and I'll $ell
you a Ca&s;e; when I went to a Lady my &s;elf to
<PB N="347" REF="352">
enquire about a Chambermaid who I had &s;ent to
me by another Per&s;on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>What was the Per&s;on that &s;ent or re|commended
her? Did &s;he know her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>She was an hone&s;t well-meaning
poor Woman that us'd to help me to Maids when
I wanted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then, I &s;uppo&s;e did not know much
of her, of her own Knowledge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>No <HI>Madam,</HI> but the Maid gave me
an Account where &s;he had liv'd la&s;t, and I went
to the Lady, and told her I came to enquire of
&s;uch a Maid-Servant, who, <HI>as &s;he had &s;aid,</HI> had
liv'd with her. Yes, &s;he told me &s;he had liv'd
with her.</P>
</SP>
<P>Pray how long did &s;he live with you, Ma|dam?
<HI>&s;aid I.</HI></P>
<P>Pray <HI>Madam,</HI> how long does &s;he &s;ay &s;he liv'd
with me? <HI>&s;ays &s;he.</HI></P>
<P>Almo&s;t a Year, <HI>Madam, &s;ays I;</HI> I think it want|ed
but a Month or thereabouts; at which &s;he
made a kind of a Hum, and &s;aid nothing for a
while.</P>
<P>Now I did not like the Way of an&s;wering my
Que&s;tion with a Que&s;tion; for I thought &s;he
might have told me po&s;itively how long the Maid
had liv'd with her, and left me to judge whe|ther
&s;he had &s;poke Truth, whereas, by returning
the Que&s;tion upon me, &s;he kept it in her own
Brea&s;t to accu&s;e or excu&s;e her. So I turn'd it
&s;hort upon her. I hope, <HI>Madam, &s;aid I,</HI> You will
be &s;o plain with me, as to let me know whether
&s;he &s;ays true or not.</P>
<P>Yes, yes? <HI>Madam, &s;ays &s;he.</HI></P>
<P>This &s;urpriz'd me again; for this had a double
meaning as plain as could be, and it was impo&s;|&s;ible
to know whether &s;he meant, Yes, that it
<PB N="348" REF="353">
was as the Maid had &s;aid, or Yes, that &s;he would
let me know whether the Maid had &s;aid true
or no. So I &s;topp'd a while to give her Time
to go on, and explain her &s;elf; but finding &s;he
did hot, I repeated my Que&s;tion. Pray <HI>Madam,
&s;ays I,</HI> be pleas'd to let me know exactly how
long &s;he liv'd with you.</P>
<P>Why <HI>Madam, &s;ays &s;he,</HI> not quite a Year; the
Maid &s;ays true in that.</P>
<P>I was far from being &s;atisfy'd with that Kind
of An&s;wer, the manner of drawing out her
Words &s;hewing me plainly, that the Wench had
lyed. However, le&s;t I &s;hould quarrel with her
too &s;oon, and &s;o have no more out of her, I
dropp'd it and ask'd her &s;ome other Que&s;tions.</P>
<P>Pray <HI>Madam, &s;ays I,</HI> is &s;he a good Workwo|man?</P>
<P>Yes, yes, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> &s;he does her Work well e|nough.</P>
<P>This was all Equivocation again. Any body
would have under&s;tood by my Que&s;tion that I en|quired
if &s;he was good at her Needle, but &s;he would
not take it as I meant it, and put it off with an
An&s;wer which might be true, if the Wench knew
but how to make a Bed, or &s;weep a Room; &s;o
I explain'd my &s;elf and &s;aid, <HI>Madam,</HI> by a good
Workwoman I mean at her Needle, I hope you
under&s;tand me.</P>
<P>Truly <HI>Madam, &s;ays &s;he,</HI> I think &s;he is well e|nough,
I never put her to much of that Kind, ha|ving
other Hands in the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Well, there &s;he came better off with me a lit|tle
than before, but &s;till all this gave me no Cha|racter
of the Maid, &s;o I went on.</P>
<P>Pray <HI>Madam, &s;ays I,</HI> What do you &s;ay to her
Hone&s;ty? &s;he is hone&s;t, I hope.</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="354">
I have no Rea&s;on to tax her Hone&s;ty, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI>
&s;he never wrong'd me of any Thing that I know
of; I charge her with nothing.</P>
<P>Even this was but a very indifferent Way of
vouching for a Girl's Hone&s;ty, and if &s;he was real|ly
hone&s;t, &s;he was not ju&s;t to her.</P>
<P>Well <HI>Madam, &s;ays I,</HI> may I ask you what was
the Occa&s;ion of your parting with her.</P>
<P>O <HI>Madam, &s;ays &s;he,</HI> we parted indeed; &s;he and
I could not agree; I am pa&s;&s;ionate and pretty
trouble&s;ome, and my Maid and I could not hit it,
but &s;he may do very well with another. Perhaps
other Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es may not be &s;o humer&s;ome and
difficult as I am; &s;he may do very well; I a&s;&s;ure
you, &s;he knows how to plea&s;e any body but me;
&s;he told me &s;o her &s;elf.</P>
<P>I was indeed provok'd now, and an&s;wer'd <HI>Ma|dam,</HI>
you are pleas'd to give your &s;elf &s;ome hard
Words; but I beg you will allow me to &s;ay, I
did not come for a Character of the Maid's Mi|&s;tre&s;s,
but a Character of the Maid; and I doubt
by your Di&s;cour&s;e, you are willing to recommend
your Maid's Character at the Expence of your
own.</P>
<P>She only &s;mil'd at me when I &s;aid thus, and
&s;aid again, &s;he was very difficult and ill to plea&s;e;
but <HI>Betty</HI> might do very well with another.</P>
<P>I pre&s;s'd her again to let me know what &s;he
parted with her Maid for, but &s;till &s;he &s;huffled me
off, and gave me the cunninge&s;t eva&s;ive An&s;wers;
<HI>Betty</HI> her &s;elf could not have put me off with
half the Dexterity as her Mi&s;tre&s;s did; &s;o I made
my Honours as if I was going away.</P>
<P><HI>Madam, &s;ays I,</HI> You are exceeding tender of
your Maid; but I cannot &s;ay, you are equally ju&s;t
to a Stranger, that you &s;ee re&s;olv'd to depend up|on
your Word for the Character of a Servant.
<PB N="350" REF="355">
However. I &s;hall take it the Way I hope you
intend it, namely, that tho' it may not be for
the Girl's Advantage to have the Particulars of
her Behaviour told; yet you would have me un|der&s;tand
by it, that her Conduct will not bear
a Chaacter, and that you would not have me
venture upon her, and I &s;hall take your Advice.</P>
<P>At this &s;he &s;eem'd concern'd, as if me had ex|pected
that her awkward Way of talking of the
Wench had &s;atisfy'd me, and that I did not un|der&s;tand
her, and as I offer'd to go, Pray <HI>Madam,
&s;ays &s;he,</HI> don't &s;ay &s;o; <HI>Betty</HI> may make you a
very good Servant; I am &s;orry you mould take
me &s;o; the Maid may do very well in another
Place, tho' me might not &s;uit me.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erv'd in the Drawing-Room to the Room we
&s;at in there &s;at a Gentleman reading in a great Book;
and every now and then he look'd off of his Book
when his Wife (for it was her Husband) &s;poke, as if
he was &s;urpriz'd at what &s;he &s;aid, and as the Folding
Doors &s;tood wide open, &s;o that the Rooms were
as it were, let both into one, he heard all we
&s;aid, and I perceiv'd that as he look'd off of his
Book when his Wife &s;poke, &s;o he almo&s;t laugh'd
out right when I &s;poke.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, as if he was not able to hold any lon|ger,
he clapp'd up the Book pretty hard, and
threw it by, and came forward into the Room
we were in, and making me a very low Bow as
he pa&s;s'd, he offer'd to go out, when his Lady
&s;tept up to him, and &s;aid &s;omething &s;oftly which
he an&s;wer'd &s;oftly, and with abundance of good
Humour in his Face laid to his Wife, my Dear,
I will not interrupt you; upon which I offer'd
to go away; By no means <HI>Madam</HI> &s;aid he, my
Bu&s;ine&s;s is of no moment. So taking hold of
his Wife's Hand, he as it were turn'd her to|wards
<PB N="351" REF="356">
me, and at going away, my Dear, &s;ays he;
don't hold the Lady in Su&s;pen&s;e about your Maid,
for I hear that is the Bu&s;ine&s;s; let her have a
true Character of her; you would be glad to be
dealt plainly with your &s;elf: His Wife &s;mil'd
but &s;aid nothing at fir&s;t, but pre&s;ently turning to
him, and all in a plea&s;ant good Humour, &s;he gave
him a little Tap on the Arm with her Hand,
Do you give a Character of her if you think I
han't done it well. Mu&s;t I &s;ays he, Why then
<HI>Madam,</HI> &s;ays he to me, with my Wife's Leave,
&s;he is a damn'd Jade, a horrid Scold, a Liar, and
tho' &s;he has, I believe, &s;tollen nothing from us,
was a Thief in the Place where &s;he came la&s;t from,
which we heard of &s;ince, and for that very thing
my Wife turned her away.</P>
<P>I made him a Cur&s;y, and told him I was great|ly
oblig'd to him for &s;o much Sincerity, and
found his Lady had been only tender of the Maid's
Character, but had not at all recommended her.
Why <HI>Madam,</HI> &s;ays he, my Wife was cheated in
this Wench, only by the People &s;he liv'd with
before giving her ambiguous An&s;wers, and &s;peak|ing
as favourably of her as they could, and that
is the Ruin of us all, adds he, in taking Ser|vants.</P>
<P>But Sir, &s;ays I, the Lady &s;he liv'd with before
did your Lady a great deal of Wrong if &s;he knew
her to be what you &s;ay &s;he was in her Service.</P>
<P>I don't know <HI>Madam,</HI> how 'twas for that: I
never meddle with the&s;e Things, &s;ays he, but I
believe my Wife was not &s;o nice in her Inquiries
as you are; or if &s;he was, &s;he was ea&s;ier to be
cheated in their An&s;wers?' and 'tis the Ladies
being thus backward to give ju&s;t and plain Ac|counts
to one another, that is the Rea&s;on that
&s;uch a wretched Gang of Wenches run from
<PB N="352" REF="357">
Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e, and get Places, and behave in
them as they do. Would the Ladies, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> be
ju&s;t to one another, &s;peak plain and hone&s;tly,
and give the Creatures &s;uch Characters as they
de&s;erve, they would take Care to de&s;erve better
Characters, and not behave &s;o in&s;olently and &s;o
&s;aucily as they do. This Jade, <HI>Madam,</HI> &s;ays he,
that you come to inquire of, has in&s;ulted and
taunted her Mi&s;tre&s;s two or three Times at
&s;uch a Rate, that I have been forc'd to &s;end a
Footman into the Room to bring her out by
Head and Shoulders, for Fear her Mi&s;tre&s;s &s;hould
be frighted, and yet &s;he is &s;o good to that Slut,
that &s;he cannot find in her Heart to &s;peak the
Truth of her.</P>
<P>My Dear, <HI>&s;ays the Lady,</HI> I have not &s;aid any
Thing but Truth of her.</P>
<P>No, my Dear, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I do not mean &s;o, but
you have not laid all the Truth of her.</P>
<P>Well, my Dear, <HI>&s;ays &s;he again,</HI> I was not upon
my Oath.</P>
<P>Why, that is true too, Child, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> but you
are upon your Honour, and that is Equivalent
to an Oath; and it would be hard to have this
Lady left to take &s;uch a Devil into her Hou&s;e,
meerly for Fear of injuring the Wench; why
you would injure the Family you &s;uffer to take
her, much more than the Maid. Let her go &s;eek
her Fortune where no body, knows her, and
there &s;he may have Time to mend her manners,
and come to Town again.</P>

<P>Why <HI>Neice,</HI> this Gentleman was your In|&s;tructor.

quite as he does.</P>

'tis for want of this Gentleman's Rule that

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fir&s;t Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would make Servants more cau|tious
of their Behaviour I confe&s;s: But then Si|&s;ter,
it would put it into the Power of Mi&s;tre&s;|&s;es
to ruin poor Servants when they pleas'd, and
even when there was no good Cau&s;e; the Bread
of a Servant would depend upon the Breath of a
Mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is no good in this World
without a Mixture of Evil; no Convenience
without its Inconvenience; but the Damage that
way, if it &s;hould be &s;o at any Time is infinitely
le&s;s than the Mi&s;chief to Families which comes
by the In&s;olence and Wickedne&s;s of Servants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>May, by the univer&s;al Degeneracy of
Servants, you might have &s;aid; for even tho&s;e

<P>Well <HI>Madam,</HI> but I could propo&s;e a
Remedy even again&s;t that Part which my Si&s;ter
objects again&s;t, of doing Servants wrong; for I
do not deny that &s;ome Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es may injure
their Servants, and there ought to be no Wrong
on either hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fir&s;t Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have known a Mi&s;tre&s;e refu&s;e to
give a poor Servant a Character, only becau&s;e &s;he
was unwilling to part with her, and yet at the
&s;ame Time u&s;e her ill too.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Such Things may happen, I do not
deny that.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fir&s;t Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have al&s;o known a Mi&s;tre&s;s injure
a Servant by her Partiality in Favour of other
Servants, and give a Maid an ill Character when
&s;he has not de&s;erv'd it, by the meer Reproaches
rais'd on her by others.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not po&s;&s;ible to reckon up all

exact, as that no Body &s;hall be oppre&s;s'd: But I
have two Things to &s;ay;
<Q><P>1. All the Inju&s;tice that can be &s;uppos'd to
happen that Way, is not equal to that
which Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es and Families now &s;uffer
from the In&s;olence and Ba&s;ene&s;s of Ser|vants;
and therefore the Remedy is to be
be and the letter Evil cho&s;en.</P>
<P>2. There may be methods directed by the
Law, that in &s;uch Ca&s;es where Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es
have nothing Capital to charge upon a
Servant, they &s;hall be obliged to give them
Certificates of their Behaviour.</P></Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have often thought of that; but un|le&s;s
the Form of that Certificate be &s;ettled and
adju&s;ted by that very Act of Parliament, the
Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es will ju&s;t write what they, plea&s;e, and
when they are prejudic'd again&s;t a Servant, will
&s;ay nothing in their Certificates that &s;hall do
them any Service, or recommend them at all to
any one el&s;e.</P>

perhaps always will be.</P>

<P>Well, there may be a Remedy for
that too, for there may be two or three &s;everal
Forms of Certificates directed by the Law; one
Voluntier, and full to all the Behaviour of a Ser|vant,
and the other to her Hone&s;ty and Sobrie|ty

turn'd very &s;hort upon me, and told me &s;he was
&s;orry &s;he could not plea&s;e me, and hop'd I would
provide my &s;elf then; I told her, that &s;he &s;hould
not &s;ay, &s;he could not plea&s;e me, but that &s;he
would not plea&s;e me.</P>

<P>She an&s;wer'd very pertly, that it was <HI>as I would,
I might take it which Way I pleas'd.</HI></P>
<P>Very well, &s;ays I, <HI>Mary,</HI> you are very tart with
me. I hope when you tend your next Mi&s;tre&s;s
to me for a Character, you will expect to hear
tho&s;e very Words again.</P>
<P>Why, wou'd I be &s;o barbarous <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> to rip up
Words that pa&s;s'd in Anger, and give them for the
Character of any Servant?</P>
<P>No <HI>Mary,</HI> &s;ays I, you &s;hould not &s;ay, will I be
&s;o barbarous; you mould &s;ay, would I be &s;o ho|ne&s;t,
as to give a Character of you from your
own Mouth. Depend upon it, <HI>Mary,</HI> &s;ays I, I
&s;hall not be &s;o unju&s;t to any Mi&s;tre&s;s to conceal
a Thing of that moment from them; why it
would be doing them the greate&s;t Injury in the
World.</P>
<P>She &s;tood &s;till a good while, and &s;aid nothing;
but as &s;he &s;aw me looking at her, as if I expected
an An&s;wer, the Girl fell a crying, run to me,
and offering to kneel to me, begg'd my Pardon,
and told me &s;he hop'd I would allow her to re|call
