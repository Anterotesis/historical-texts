<L>Like long-lain-by Armour, they're ru&s;ty with Scorn;</L>

<L>In Men 'tis the &s;ame; they may &s;et up for Science,</L>
<L>And Cynical dare to &s;et laugh at Defiance:</L>
<L>Their Learning, their Rea&s;on, their Wi&s;dom they &s;how,</L>
<L>Yet one half Hour's Laugh's beyond all that they know.</L>

<LG>
<L>To help that laugh on we've open'd our Fea&s;t,</L>
