<HEAD>THE INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>_ON the fir&s;t <HI>Setting out</HI> depends the <HI>Fate of the Journey</HI>; and therefore to obviate a Prejudice, which might ea&s;ily happen, it is fit we &s;hou'd give all our Rea|dears <HI>one Caution</HI>, by way of Introduction.</P>
<P>We ea&s;ily fore&s;ee, that it will be impo&s;&s;ible for the Subjects we have cho&s;en in this our Fir&s;t Book, to be equally plea&s;ing to every Ta&s;te: Neither indeed cou'd any <HI>other</HI> have been &s;o, which we might have pitch'd on in their &s;tead. For it &s;hou'd be con&s;ider'd, that the <HI>Intere&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Inclinations</HI> of Men, are as various as their <HI>Faces</HI>; and that nothing was
<PB N="4" REF="4">
ever &s;o happily &s;truck, but that <HI>&s;ome</HI> have di&s;lik'd it.</P>
<P>Yet it were an Imprudence for a Man to conclude, that becau&s;e the E&s;&s;ays we <HI>begin with</HI>, may happen to differ from his Reli&s;h, or be <HI>out of his way</HI>, that therefore <HI>the Re&s;t</HI> will <HI>continue</HI> to be &s;o. Our Work mu&s;t con|&s;i&s;t of a never ending <HI>Variety:</HI> And be&s;ides, that a little Patience will certainly produce &s;omething fit for his Purpo&s;e, his Friends may be <HI>pleas'd</HI> in the Interim, and his Family <HI>in|&s;tructed</HI> by Subjects, which are ever &s;o wide from his own way of thinking.</P>
<P>There is more in this Caution than a Man at fir&s;t View perhaps wou'd imagine; and to fix it the &s;tronger in our Readers Opinion, we &s;hall tell a <HI>true Story</HI>, not at all from our Purpo&s;e, and leave the <HI>Application</HI> to every Man's Judgment.</P>
<P>When Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> was Governor of <HI>Brazile</HI> for the <HI>Dutch</HI>, and encourag'd the falling into Sugar Plantations, an Inhabitant of the Colony was pre&s;ented with a Book, which had been taken in a Prize, and con|tain'd an Account of &s;ome Progre&s;s in Experi|mental Philo&s;ophy, by a Profe&s;&s;or of that Science in the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Salamanca</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="5">The Planter, not accu&s;tom'd to read or con|&s;ider &s;uch Variety of Matter, and meeting, at his fir&s;t looking into the Treati&s;e, with a long Di&s;&s;ertation on the Nature of <HI>Colours</HI>, concluded the Subject to be <HI>out of his Way</HI>, and threw a&s;ide the Book, with the Negligence u&s;ual on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>It happened, a Year or Two after, that as this Planter was bu&s;ied in his Sugar Hou&s;e, he was dangerou&s;ly <HI>Scalded</HI> by the <HI>Boiling over</HI> of the <HI>Liquor</HI>, which kill'd a poor <HI>Ne|gro</HI> outright, and from which he <HI>him&s;elf</HI> found it difficult to recover, after tedious and painful Confinement to his Chamber.</P>
<P>He was &s;itting one Day, as he began to be on the mending Hand, and took Notice, that a Lap-Dog in the Room was more bu&s;y than ordinary in <HI>&s;craping</HI> and &s;truggling with his Feet, to get &s;omething out from under a Ca|binet. His Wife ro&s;e to &s;ee what it was, and drew out <HI>the Book above-mentioned</HI>, cover'd over with Du&s;t; having fallen by chance, and lain there forgotten and unenquir'd after.</P>
<P>The Planter, now, in more Compo&s;ure of Mind than was u&s;ual, through his long want of Company, bethought him&s;elf that he wou'd dip here and there in the Book, and endea|vour &s;ome Diver&s;ion from <HI>that Entertainment</HI>,
<PB N="6" REF="6">
for want of a <HI>Better</HI>. Accordingly, he open'd it at random, and the fir&s;t Page he fix'd on, began in this manner.&mdash;<HI>From the foregoing Con&s;iderations it is ea&s;y to a&s;&s;ign a good Rea|&s;on for a very odd Effect, which the Planters of Sugar ob&s;erve in their Boilers, into which, if they throw but a &s;mall piece of Butter, not much bigger than a Nutmeg, it infallibly keeps $wn the Liquor, which otherwi&s;e is often apt to boil</HI> over <HI>with a mo&s;t &s;udden and dangerous Violence</HI>.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y to imagine he was <HI>&s;tartled</HI>, to light unexpectedly on a Hint, which con|cern'd him &s;o <HI>nearly</HI>: He concluded however, that it was an improbable Fancy, and not worth believing; but his Wife, of a <HI>Nature</HI> more <HI>curious</HI> and <HI>inqui&s;itive</HI>, gave Orders to their Over&s;eer, for <HI>trying</HI> the <HI>Experiment</HI>, and found, to her Amazement, that upon throwing in the Butter, when the Liquor was ju&s;t in its Fury of ri&s;ing, it <HI>fell flat in a Mo|ment</HI>, and continued to boil with a miraculous <HI>Calmne&s;s</HI>.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, this poor Secret has, from that time to this, maintain'd its Reputation. It has gradually &s;pread through the Sugar Plan|tations of <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>America</HI>, and is practis'd at this very Day by our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in <HI>Barbadoes</HI>, with never-failing Effect. But the Planters <HI>pa&s;t Smart</HI> was <HI>renew'd</HI>, and made <HI>&s;harper</HI>, by
<PB N="7" REF="7">
Reflection on the Mi&s;ery he had &s;uffer'd through his <HI>want of Curio&s;ity</HI>; &s;ince he had certainly found out the Secret <HI>before</HI>, and thereby <HI>prevented</HI> his <HI>Misfortune</HI>, if he had not too ra&s;hly rejected the <HI>Whole</HI>, becau&s;e <HI>Part</HI> of the Book was not writ <HI>to his Reli&s;h</HI>.</P>
<P>The Reader will pre&s;ently &s;ee, what a <HI>U&s;e</HI> we propo&s;e he &s;hou'd make of the foregoing Example: Which having recommended once more to his <HI>&s;erious Reflection</HI>, we go on $word$ our Bu&s;ine&s;s; and begin the De&s;ign with $word$ following Matter, in Re&s;pect to the Ladies.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY I.</HEAD>
<P>_IT has long been a Notion receiv'd as a Certainty, that they cannot make fine <HI>China Ware</HI> in <HI>England</HI>, or indeed in any other Countrey of the World, but in that part of the <HI>Indies</HI>, from whence it is brought us: And to back this Opinion with &s;ome Shew of <HI>Rea&s;on</HI>, we are told, that the <HI>Chi|ne&s;e them&s;elves</HI> cannot make it, but of <HI>one</HI> kind of Earth only; and that <HI>even the proper Earth</HI> is unfit for the purpo&s;e, till it has lain for an Age or two <HI>buried</HI>; and that, as it draws nearer to its <HI>Pitch</HI> of <HI>Perfection</HI>, it Yearly <HI>increa&s;es in Value</HI>, and is left as a Legacy from Father to Son, till it reaches its <HI>Period</HI>.</P>
<P>We &s;hall prove this Report to be nothing but Amu&s;ement, by in&s;tructing the mo&s;t ordinary <HI>Pot|ter</HI> in <HI>England</HI>, to make as fine <HI>China</HI> as ever was &s;old by the <HI>Ea&s;t-India Company</HI>; and that with &s;uch Ea&s;e, that it may be afforded almo&s;t as cheap as the commone&s;t Earthen Ware. Bu$ we will <HI>begin</HI> the <HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI>, for the Satisfaction of Per&s;ons, who&s;e Curio&s;ity leads them to enquire after Things they are yet unacquainted withal, with a true Informati|on
<PB N="10" REF="10">
<HI>what Earth it is</HI> they make u&s;e of among the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI>, and <HI>bow</HI> they <HI>prepare it</HI> for this brittle Manufacture.</P>
<P>The Earth is a kind of <HI>Tobacco-Pipe Clay</HI>, per|haps &s;omewhat fitter than ours, by the Sun's nearer Influence. When they fir&s;t dig it up, they expo&s;e it a while to the Air, and then work it with Shovels, and much treading of their Feet; after which they form it in <HI>Molds</HI>, as we do <HI>Bricks</HI> in <HI>England</HI>, but <HI>&s;maller</HI>, and bake it in Ovens, with a violent Heat from Furnaces below them.</P>
<P>The&s;e bak'd Cakes of Earth they <HI>grind down to Powder</HI> in Mills made on purpo&s;e: When the Powder is as <HI>fine</HI> as it can be made by that Proce&s;s, they have recour&s;e to the <HI>following Contrivance</HI>, to make it <HI>&s;till finer</HI>.</P>
<P>They throw it into Ci&s;terns of <HI>Water</HI>, and &s;tir it about without cea&s;ing, for an Hour or more: After which they let it &s;tand ju&s;t &s;o long, as till the Surface is free from the <HI>Motion</HI> which their <HI>&s;tir|ring</HI> had given it, and then let it out at a Tap near the Bottom. By which means, the <HI>heavie&s;t</HI> Parti|cles, &s;inking naturally down, the <HI>fine</HI> undi&s;tin|gui&s;hable <HI>Atoms</HI>, which <HI>float</HI> in the Body of the Water, and colour it like Milk, are <HI>drawn off with it</HI>, into another large Ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>In this &s;econd Ve&s;&s;el, the Water is &s;uffer'd to <HI>&s;tand</HI> for a Week or Ten Days; in which time there is <HI>&s;ettled to the Bottom</HI>, a very con&s;iderable Quan|tity of a <HI>Milk white &s;oft Sub&s;tance</HI>, of an inex|pre&s;&s;ible <HI>Finene&s;s</HI>; which when they have obtain'd, by <HI>drawing off the Water</HI>, they <HI>work</HI>, and <HI>make
<PB N="11" REF="11">
up</HI>, as our <HI>Potters</HI> do <HI>Clay</HI>, but with a great deal more Neatne&s;s and Nicety.</P>
<P>Their Cups being <HI>&s;hap'd</HI>, and <HI>rough-made</HI>, they let &s;tand till half dry; and then with an In&s;tru|ment of Copper, by rubbing them over, in&s;ide and out, they <HI>poli&s;h</HI> and <HI>&s;mooth</HI> them to their Fancy, and replace them to dry, till they are fit to be <HI>glaz'd</HI>.</P>
<P>For the <HI>Glazing</HI>, they grind down that <HI>&s;now-white Enamel</HI>, which is commonly made by our <HI>Jewellers</HI> and <HI>others</HI>; and having purify'd it with <HI>Aqua Fortis</HI>, they prepare it by <HI>grinding</HI> on a Pain|ters Marble with a little <HI>Gum-water</HI>, and &s;o <HI>Glaze</HI> the <HI>China</HI>, and &s;et it to <HI>Bake</HI> in the Ovens above|mentioned, where the Fire mu&s;t be &s;trong enough to make it red hot; and be &s;uffer'd to go out, of it &s;elf, that the <HI>China</HI> may cool by <HI>degrees</HI>, which were otherwi&s;e in danger of <HI>breaking</HI>.</P>
<P>The next Thing they do, is to <HI>Paint</HI> the Out|&s;ides of the Ware, as we &s;ee it brought over. The Painting it &s;elf is no otherwi&s;e different from <HI>Limning in General</HI>, than in the way of <HI>preparing the Colours</HI>, which being form'd of the <HI>variou&s;ly-tinctur'd</HI> Enamels, are dry'd in by Fire, in little Furnaces for the Purpo&s;e: But the manner of Paint|ing on Enamel in all kind of Colours, being <HI>com|mon in England</HI>, it is needle&s;s to teach its Par|ticulars.</P>
<P>When the Di&s;hes are <HI>Painted</HI> to the Fancy of the Workman, they are <HI>once more</HI> put into the Furnace, to <HI>Bake in</HI> the Colours; after which there remains no more Work, and the <HI>China</HI> is fit for the Market.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="12">The foregoing De&s;cription contains the <HI>whole Chine&s;e Practice</HI> in making this valuable Ware, from the fir&s;t to the la&s;t; whence it plainly ap|pears, that as we have <HI>Potters, Enamellers</HI>, and <HI>Pointers</HI> in <HI>England</HI>, who can work in their Arts as well as the People of any other Nation what|ever, there is nothing we can <HI>want</HI> for the <HI>making of China</HI> in its utmo&s;t Perfection, but the <HI>Earth</HI> 'tis compos'd of.</P>
<P>We have not, as yet, had a proper Opportunity, to <HI>make the Experiment</HI>; but we firmly <HI>believe</HI>, our <HI>Tobacco-Pipe Clay</HI>, bak'd over and over, and often <HI>refin'd</HI> by the Proce&s;s before-mention'd, might be <HI>capable of doing it:</HI> And we are the rather in|clin'd to propo&s;e it, from an Ob&s;ervation, which all Men may, every Day make, that the <HI>Clay</HI> of which <HI>Tobacco-Pipes</HI> are <HI>made</HI>, can, by no means, compare with the Clearne&s;s and Whitene&s;s of the <HI>Pipes them&s;elves</HI>; and yet tho&s;e white Pipes attain that Improvement by <HI>one Single Baking</HI>.</P>
<P>But leaving the uncertain Effect of this <HI>Conjecture</HI> to the Trial of the Curious, we give you the fol|lowing, as a <HI>try'd</HI> and <HI>infallible</HI> Method.</P>
<P>Let any good Workman in the Potters Profe&s;|&s;ion, who would benefit him&s;elf by this Art, em|ploy &s;ome poor People to buy up the <HI>old broken China</HI>, which every Hou&s;e can afford him. This Ware he mu&s;t <HI>grind in a Mill</HI>, with a flat Stone and Runner. The Mill is a <HI>common one</HI>, and every-where to be met with. The Powder, when it comes from the Mill, mu&s;t be further reduced
<PB N="13" REF="13">
and <HI>refin'd</HI> by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Water</HI>, in the manner which was ju&s;t now de&s;crib'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>gro&s;s Parts</HI>, which <HI>&s;ettle</HI>, and <HI>lie in the Bottom</HI>, and are not drawn off with the Water, may be <HI>dry'd</HI>, and ground over again with new Ware, &s;o that nothing is lo&s;t in this Practice. But the fine Stuff, or Sub&s;tance, which will be got from the <HI>Settling</HI> of the <HI>Water</HI>, when let &s;tand in the Second Ve&s;&s;el, mu&s;t be mix'd with the Fourth Part of its Weight, of <HI>Quick-Lime</HI>, di&s;&s;olv'd in <HI>Gum-Water</HI>.</P>
<P>The Quick-Lime here meant, mu&s;t be <HI>diffe|rent</HI> from the <HI>common Sort</HI>, and is made in a Fur|nace, of what Size you plea&s;e, by no other La|bour, or Charge, than <HI>burning clean Oy&s;ter-&s;hells</HI>, as they do <HI>Chalk</HI>, in <HI>Lime-Kilns</HI>. Of this Compo&s;i|tion, mu&s;t the Di&s;hes be made; and being after|wards <HI>Bak'd, Glaz'd</HI>, and <HI>Painted</HI>, in all which there is nothing <HI>uncommon</HI>, or <HI>difficult</HI>, you have <HI>China-Ware</HI> perfect, and fini&s;h'd, as that from the <HI>Indies:</HI> For indeed it is the &s;ame, both in <HI>Figure</HI> and <HI>Sub&s;tance</HI>.</P>
<P>We have done with this Part of the Subject: And if any &s;hould object, that <HI>none but a Potter can be|nefit by it</HI>; they are an&s;wer'd, We began our E&s;&s;ays with a Caution to our Readers, that they &s;hou'd not expect to be <HI>all pleas'd at once</HI>. Though, be|&s;ides the great <HI>general Profit</HI> of &s;uch an Improve|ment in the Nation, the Pur&s;es of <HI>mo&s;t Men</HI> will be &s;en&s;ibly &s;erv'd, by reducing the pre&s;ent extra|vagant Rates of this Fa&s;hionable Furniture, and making &s;ome kind of <HI>Amends</HI> for its <HI>Brittlene&s;s</HI>,
<PB N="14" REF="14">
by giving a <HI>Value</HI>, even <HI>after 'tis broke</HI>, to that which is <HI>now</HI>, but <HI>unprofitable Rubbi&s;h</HI>.</P>
<P>We are &s;ure no Objection can rea&s;onably lie again&s;t putting in Practice &s;o gainful, as well as &s;o u&s;eful a Manufacture; unle&s;s it &s;hall be thought a &s;ufficient Ob&s;truction, that when the Improvement is generally fallen into, the <HI>Matter</HI> it &s;elf, upon which it depends, will <HI>fail them in Time</HI>, becau&s;e 'tis impo&s;&s;ible (when the fir&s;t Stock is con&s;um'd) to be furni&s;h'd with <HI>broken China</HI>, in Quantities proportion'd to the Call there will be for it.</P>
<P>We an&s;wer to this; 'twill be long before any &s;uch Want can take Place; and the <HI>fir&s;t Underta|kers</HI> will &s;ufficiently benefit them&s;elves in the Interim.</P>
<P>Neither is there any Rea&s;on to doubt, if our Hint of <HI>refining Tobacco-Pipe Clay</HI>, &s;hou'd not an|&s;wer our Hopes; but that when the making of <HI>China</HI> &s;hall be common in <HI>England</HI>, the inqui&s;itive Genius of our People, pu&s;h'd on to due Search by a Pro&s;pect of <HI>Profit</HI>, will di&s;cover, in &s;ome Part or other of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>, as fine, and as capable <HI>Earths</HI>, as tho&s;e of the <HI>Indies</HI>. And to &s;hew the Di&s;tru&s;ters, that this Expectation is no way <HI>Chi|merical</HI>, we will tell them a Story, that may <HI>en|courage</HI> &s;uch Endeavours.</P>
<P>In the Heat of the Second <HI>Dutch</HI> War, a Ship of that Country was wreck'd in a Storm on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Norfolk</HI>; one poor Sailor was all who e&s;cap'd of the Crew, and he made hard Shift to reach Land on a Piece of the Wreck.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="15">Half dead with <HI>Cold</HI>, and the <HI>Fatigue of his De|liverance</HI>; he crept to the Hou&s;e of a Neigh|bouring Farmer; who, believing it unlawful to &s;helter an Enemy, wou'd by no means be tempted to give him Admi&s;&s;ion; &s;o that driven to Extre|mity, unknown, and helple&s;s, he had no View before him, but to wander up and down, in hopes he might light accidentally on &s;ome more <HI>Ho&s;pi|table Dwelling</HI>.</P>
<P>In a Lane which he pa&s;s'd through, he &s;aw an <HI>old Coat</HI> hung over a Gate; he look'd every way round him to di&s;cover the <HI>Owner</HI>, but not &s;eeing any Body near him, and the Evening coming on, he bethought him&s;elf that it might be of U&s;e to put on that Coat, while he threw off his wet Cloaths to <HI>dry</HI>; &s;o he took it from the Gate, and withdrew towards a <HI>Cop&s;e</HI>, not far di&s;tant.</P>
<P>The Owner of the Coat was a <HI>Ditcher</HI>, then at work pretty near; he &s;aw the <HI>Dutch</HI> Sailor from an oppo&s;ite Hedge, coming over the Field, and thinking he had <HI>&s;tolen</HI> the Coat, he &s;urpriz'd him on a &s;udden, and taking it from him, examin'd him, in a Language he under&s;tood not the Mean|ing of, <HI>Who he was</HI>, and by what Means he <HI>came thither</HI> in &s;o wet a Condition.</P>
<P>The Gentleman, for whom the Ditcher was at Work, had formerly been a <HI>Merchant</HI>, and &s;pent much of his Youth with the <HI>Hollanders</HI>: He was walking at that Time in the <HI>Cop&s;e</HI>, and being di&s;turbed at the indi&s;tinct Sound of a Jargon, half <HI>Dutch</HI> half <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>, came our to the Field, and <HI>unriddled the Matter</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="16" MS="Y">He took Pity on the Mi&s;ery of a Stranger, brought him home to his Hou&s;e, and refre&s;h'd him with <HI>Sleep</HI>, and a <HI>warm Sute of Cloaths</HI>, and under|took to &s;ollicit the Means of his <HI>Return</HI> to his Country.</P>
<P>The Merit of his Charity was overtaken in the Act, by a <HI>Reward</HI> as unexpected as the <HI>Accident</HI>. The Gentleman had at this Time employ'd a great Number of Workmen, in <HI>draining</HI> a large Track of <HI>Meadow</HI>, and finding in Di&s;cour&s;e, that his <HI>Dutch Gue&s;t</HI> had &s;ome Skill in Bu&s;ine&s;s of that Nature, he took him out with him one Morning, and de|&s;ir'd his Advice, in removing &s;ome Difficulties, which his Drainers had met with.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Dutchman</HI> came into the Field, he &s;topp'd &s;hort with <HI>Surprize</HI>, at a Bank of <HI>Whi$e Earth</HI>, which had been ca&s;t up by the Diggers: The Gentleman demanded the Cau&s;e of his ex|amining that Clay with &s;uch <HI>Earne&s;tne&s;s</HI>; and was an&s;wer'd, that it was &s;old in his Country at extravagant Rates, to the Makers of <HI>Delf Ware</HI>, and fine Earthen Ve&s;&s;els, being brought down the <HI>Rhine</HI>, out of &s;ome Place in <HI>Germany</HI>, and very much coveted in all Parts of <HI>Holland</HI>.</P>
<P>The Gentleman, to make the be&s;t U&s;e of this Hint, upon Conclu&s;ion of the Peace, which hap|pen'd &s;oon after, &s;ent over a <HI>Sample</HI>, and finding the Sailor's Account to be <HI>true</HI>&punc; he open'd the <HI>Vein</HI>, and dug up &s;uch a Quantity, as brought him in a Profit of <HI>Ten Thou&s;and pounds</HI> in Lighte$n Months Time: But the St$ck was <HI>exhau&s;ted</HI> and he never could find any more in his Lands, thoug$

<P>We hope the <HI>Example of this Story</HI> may have Power to influence the <HI>Curio&s;ity</HI> of our <HI>Gentlemen:</HI> And the rather, becau&s;e there are many E&s;tates, now in <HI>Mortgage</HI> for above half their Value, who&s;e <HI>unfortunate Owners</HI> walk every Day over Trea&s;ure enough to make them ea&s;y for ever, without knowing, or thinking of any &s;uch Matter.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY II.</HEAD>
<P>_THERE is not among the many <HI>Com|plaints</HI> in this City, any one that is <HI>ju&s;ter</HI>, or more <HI>common</HI>, than that of the great <HI>Price of Coals in the Winter</HI>; by which means it &s;ometimes has happen'd, that many <HI>Poor People</HI> have been nigh &s;tarv'd to Death, and Per&s;ons of <HI>moderate Sub|&s;tance</HI> con&s;iderably Inconvenienc'd.</P>
<P>We believe we &s;hall do an <HI>Univer&s;al good Work</HI>, if we point out &s;ome Means for an <HI>Ea&s;e to this Burthen</HI>. And the rather, &s;ince there is not a Family in <HI>London</HI>, but may, with no further Trouble than the Labour of a Servant, conti|nually furni&s;h them&s;elves with large Coal for Firing, as u&s;eful as <HI>Scotch-Coal</HI>, at a Third Part of the Charge they are now at for common <HI>Sea-Coal</HI>.</P>
<P>The <HI>Expence</HI>, which is nece&s;&s;ary for beginning this Work, is very <HI>incon&s;iderable</HI>, in Compari&s;on with the <HI>Benefit</HI>, and is but for <HI>once</HI>. After which the Materials are &s;erviceable for ever, and require no Additional Charges. But People, who
<PB N="20" REF="21">
can't well afford to lay out the Money, how little &s;oever, they may without it perform all the La|bour <HI>by Hand</HI>, and that with much Ea&s;e, in Re|gard they con&s;ume a <HI>le&s;s Quantity</HI> of Fuel.</P>
<P>But they, who are <HI>able</HI> and <HI>willing</HI> to be at the above-meant Expence, mu&s;t give Orders to &s;ome <HI>Iron-Millmaker</HI>, to furni&s;h them with a Mill &s;ome|what <HI>bigger</HI>, and <HI>&s;tronger</HI> than a <HI>Malt-Mill</HI>, but of the &s;ame kind of <HI>Make</HI>, with a Hopper upon it, which will hold a good deal more than a Bu&s;hel; the Figure of which you may &s;ee in the Cut.</P>
<P>This Mill &s;hould be plac'd in &s;ome Corner of the Coal-Cellar, and the Coals, which are laid in for the U&s;e of the Family, may be ju&s;t a <HI>Fourth Part</HI> of the Quantity, which they formerly burnt. And whereas it is u&s;ual at pre&s;ent, for People to chu&s;e out the <HI>large&s;t</HI>, and mo&s;t <HI>lumpy Coal</HI> they can get; the fitte&s;t for their Purpo&s;e in this <HI>new Im|provement</HI>, will be the <HI>&s;malle&s;t</HI>, and mo&s;t <HI>broken</HI>, even, if po&s;&s;ible, the very <HI>Sifting</HI> of the Wharfin|gers Coal-Heaps.</P>
<P>The Coal, when laid into the Cellar, mu&s;t&punc; as Lei&s;ure and Opportunity offer, be <HI>ground down in the Mill</HI>, by the Labour of &s;ome Servant, or a Workman, who may be hir'd for the Purpo&s;e. The Mill mu&s;t be <HI>&s;et</HI> &s;o, as to grind very <HI>fine</HI>; for the &s;maller the Powder, the fitter for the Bu&s;ine&s;s. And if any Coals are too big for the Teeth of the Mill, 'twill be ea&s;y for the Workman to <HI>break them</HI> with a Mallet, and thereby reduce them to a Size more convenient.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="22">While the Coal is thus Grinding, and laid up in a Readine&s;s in one Corner of the Cellar, &s;ome Lightermen, Balla&s;tmen, or Bargemen, mu&s;t be agreed with for a Quantity of that <HI>black Ow&s;y Mud</HI>, which is common on both Sides the <HI>Thames</HI>, from Low-Water-Mark to the Banks of the River, and which may al&s;o be met with in all <HI>Ponds, Canals</HI>, and the <HI>Ditches</HI> of <HI>Gardiners, Whit&s;ers</HI>, and <HI>Mar&s;h-Lands</HI>, which abound beyond Number in the <HI>flat</HI> Grounds below Bridge.</P>
<P>It is to be noted, that, for the better Conve|niency of <HI>Carriage</HI>, the Ow&s;e may be thrown up to <HI>dry</HI> in round Heaps, above Highwater-Mark, by which Means, when the <HI>Lighters</HI> deliver it to <HI>Carmen</HI>, they may bring it <HI>in Sacks</HI>, or <HI>without</HI>, at their Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>When the Ow&s;e and the Coal are both ready in the Cellar, the Workman mu&s;t <HI>mix</HI> them as follows: To every Shovel-full of the Powder of <HI>Coal</HI>, he mu&s;t throw in Three Shovels full of <HI>Ow&s;e</HI>, and work, beat, and mingle them together, till he has got a large Heap in the middle of the Cellar. He mu&s;t then make a Hollow in the Top of the Heap, and pour in a Quantity of Wa|ter, ju&s;t enough to give <HI>Moi&s;tne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Con&s;i&s;tence</HI> to the Mixture; after which, he mu&s;t <HI>back, beat</HI> and <HI>labour it together</HI> with the Edges, and Back of a Spade, till 'tis thoroughly prepared, and will <HI>cut clo&s;e</HI> like Wax.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="23">He mu&s;t then, with his Hands, make it up into <HI>Balls</HI>, about the Size of a <HI>large Cannon Bullet</HI>, and lay them to <HI>Dry</HI>, in the manner of <HI>Pyramids</HI>, that the Air pa&s;&s;ing ea&s;ily through the Hollows, be|tween Ball and Ball, may <HI>harden</HI> and fit them for the U&s;e, they are made for.</P>
<P>For the better <HI>comprehending</HI> all this, we have repre&s;ented the &s;everal Parts of the Work in a Cut, Number 2.</P>
<P>We have narrowly &s;earch'd, by Experience, into the Charges, and the Benefits of this new Fuel: The Expence in the <HI>whole</HI>, brings the <HI>Culm-Balls</HI>, when fit for the Fire, to le&s;s than <HI>Four Pence per Bu&s;hel</HI>, &s;uppo&s;ing the <HI>Coals</HI> to be furni&s;h'd at the <HI>be&s;t Hand</HI>, and in the <HI>Summer Sea&s;on</HI>; and yet, for <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI>, for <HI>Heat</HI>, for <HI>long Burning</HI>, and <HI>Cleanline&s;s, One</HI> Bu&s;hel of <HI>this</HI> is worth <HI>Two</HI> of Sea-Coal.</P>
<P>The <HI>Figure</HI> of a <HI>Fire</HI> made of <HI>Culm-Balls</HI>, is exactly what you &s;ee it in the <HI>Cut</HI>. The Ow&s;e is &s;o <HI>Fat</HI>, and &s;o <HI>naturally Combu&s;tible</HI>, that 'tis im|po&s;&s;ible for any Thing to burn with &s;o <HI>&s;triking</HI> a <HI>Liveline&s;s</HI>; it throws out a forcible, glowing, and regular Heat; it continues to burn from Six to Eight Hours, with &s;carce any vi&s;ible Le&s;&s;ening: And it neither <HI>falls out</HI> through the Grate, like &s;mall Du&s;ty Coals, nor makes any foul <HI>Smoak</HI>, or heavy dark <HI>A&s;hes</HI>, but goes off, to the la&s;t, with a clear &s;prightly <HI>Brightne&s;s</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="24">Every Thing, we know, is a <HI>Difficulty</HI> to the Doubtful.

<P>_HAVING <HI>touch'd</HI> an Occa&s;ional Pro|&s;pect in the <HI>Clo&s;e</HI> of the foregoing <HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI>, concerning a probable Profit to be made of the overflow'd Mar&s;h-Lands at <HI>Dagenham</HI>, we &s;hall, in what fol|lows, propo&s;e a new, ea&s;y, and very cheap Method for <HI>&s;hutting up that Breach</HI>; and not only that, but all others, which already <HI>are made</HI>, or which here|after <HI>may happen</HI>, whether by Force of the <HI>Sea</HI>, or of <HI>Rivers</HI>.</P>
<P>We particularly aim this Di&s;cour&s;e as a <HI>Hint</HI>, which may do Service to a worthy and ingenious Gentleman, who has, for &s;ome Time, been engag'd in a Work of this Nature at the Place above|mention'd; it being conceiv'd, upon rational Grounds, that this very Breach, when <HI>at wor&s;t</HI>, might have been <HI>&s;topt</HI> by &s;uch Mea&s;ures, as we &s;hall <HI>lay down</HI>, for le&s;s than a <HI>Tenth Part</HI> of the Charge, which it has occa&s;ion'd in vain, even be|fore it was undertaken by the pre&s;ent Adventurer, who&s;e Experience, and former Succe&s;&s;es in Works of this kind, give us hopes it will <HI>now</HI> be accom|pli&s;h'd.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="28">About Eight Years ago, in the Night, by the force of a violent Wind, a High Tide bore too hard upon the Banks; and the <HI>Mar&s;h Wall</HI>, as they call it, which is the <HI>River Bank, giving way</HI>, the Wa|ter <HI>flow'd through</HI>, and came over the Pa&s;tures.</P>
<P>The Neglect of this Breach, or the too weak and &s;low Progre&s;s, which was <HI>then</HI> made again&s;t it, gave the River a Power to enlarge its Inva&s;ions, till at la&s;t they became <HI>irre&s;i&s;tible</HI>; and opening a Pa&s;&s;age of a Hundred Yards wide, the Tide ru&s;hes through it with a Swiftne&s;s and Violence, which cannot be &s;o much as imagin'd, but by &s;eeing it. And the numberle&s;s <HI>Fluxes</HI> and <HI>Refluxes</HI> having <HI>worn away the Bottom</HI> to a very great depth, the Endeavours of &s;everal Gentlemen, at prodigious Expences, were too weak to with&s;tand its <HI>over|bearing</HI>: For the <HI>Piles</HI>, or huge Trees, with &s;harp Iron-&s;hod Points, which they caus'd to be <HI>driven down</HI>, being <HI>&s;app'd</HI> and <HI>undermin'd</HI>, by the <HI>letting in</HI> of the Waters at their Bottom, were <HI>born up</HI> on a &s;udden, and the <HI>Chalk-&s;tones, Bags of Earth</HI>, and <HI>Bank Rubbi&s;h</HI> they &s;upported, were of cour&s;e <HI>wa&s;h'd away</HI> by the Deluge.</P>
<P>The Point to be gain'd, for effectually <HI>Inning</HI> this terrible Breach, is, to clo&s;e up the Throat of its Channel with a Bank of &s;uch Strength and So|lidity, as to bear all the Force of the Stream, while 'tis <HI>Rai&s;ing</HI>, and the great Weight of Water, which will a&s;&s;ault, and lie again&s;t it, when 'tis <HI>Rai&s;ed</HI>.</P>
<P>To which End, the Reader may be plea&s;ed to take notice, that the natural Soil of the Place is an excellent <HI>Clay</HI>, and if a <HI>Brick-work</HI> were erected
<PB N="27" REF="29">
<HI>on each &s;ide the Breach</HI>, they might make <HI>large &s;trong Bricks</HI> of a new kind, on purpo&s;e, <HI>in Moulds of Two Foot Square</HI>, or more, with <HI>Holes</HI> here and there left <HI>through them</HI> in their forming, which would make them <HI>dry ea&s;ily</HI>.</P>
<P>Such large Bricks as the&s;e are <HI>common</HI> in <HI>Italy</HI>, and frequently us'd in the <HI>Walls</HI> of their <HI>Ca&s;tles</HI>. They deliver them at the Makers for about <HI>Five Pound the Thou&s;and</HI>.</P>
<P>The <HI>Largene&s;s</HI> of the&s;e Bricks, when made at the Breach, will be no way a <HI>hinderance to their Burning</HI>; for not only the <HI>Quantity</HI> of Fuel is pro|portion'd to their <HI>&s;ize</HI>, but the <HI>Holes</HI>, which pa&s;s through them, by admitting the Heat, make their Hardening as ea&s;y, as if they were &s;maller: And it is to be ob&s;erv'd, that the purpo&s;e, for which we are making the&s;e Bricks, will require no Nicety of <HI>Colour</HI>; and they may therefore be burnt without Trouble, or Caution.</P>
<P>As the <HI>Earth</HI> for the Bricks is the <HI>Product</HI> of the <HI>Place</HI>, &s;o al&s;o may be the <HI>Fuel</HI> for their <HI>Burn|ing</HI>: The huge Reeds abounding, as we mention'd before, over all the drown'd Land, being <HI>cut up and dry'd</HI>, is the fine&s;t and propere&s;t Matter, which cou'd be wi&s;h'd for the purpo&s;e, and e&s;pecially, as it may be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the tough &s;tringy Sub&s;tance, than which the whole World cannot yield a more excellent Fuel.</P>
<P>Thus, without the Expence, or the Trouble of Carriage, is provided what &s;tore can be wanted of the&s;e new Materials, and it only remains to di&s;co|ver their <HI>U&s;es</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="30">In proportion to the Strength and Depth of the Water, mu&s;t the <HI>Breadth</HI> of a <HI>Bank</HI> be de&s;ign'd; In the Ca&s;e we are &s;peaking of, <HI>a Hundred Foot broad</HI> &s;hall be pitched on as a Standard, and (<HI>the Place for the Bank being cho&s;en, and mark'd out)</HI> exactly in the mid&s;t of the &s;pace 'tis to ri&s;e in, mu&s;t be laid, as may be &s;een in the Cut, a &s;trong <HI>Float</HI>, Floar'd with Deal, and built upon &s;mall Boats, or <HI>Pontons</HI>, and of Length enough to reach quite cro&s;s the Breach, kept exact to its Place, between <HI>Piles on each Shore</HI>, or by any <HI>other</HI> Means they like better, and ea&s;ily <HI>ri&s;ing</HI> and <HI>&s;inking</HI> with the <HI>Flood</HI> or the <HI>Ebb</HI>: The <HI>Breadth</HI> of the Float may be Fifteen or Twenty Foot over.</P>
<P>The Brick-kilns on either &s;ide the Breach, mu&s;t, as you may &s;ee in the Cut, &s;tand clo&s;e to the Edge of the Chanel, for the more &s;wift and ea&s;y Convey|ance of the <HI>Breach-&s;tones</HI>, as we will call them, to the Place of their Service on the Float-Bridge, which may be done in <HI>Wheelbarrows</HI>, as in the Cut, or by any other readier Method.</P>
<P>There mu&s;t be &s;everal Workmen continually em|ploy'd in <HI>carrying the Breach-&s;tones</HI>, and others, who <HI>apply them to their U&s;e</HI>, which la&s;t need not be more than <HI>Twenty</HI>; that is, one Man to every five Yards of the Length of the Float, &s;uppo&s;ing the Breach to be <HI>a Hundred Yards over</HI>.</P>
<P>The&s;e Twenty Men, &s;tanding every one in his proper place upon the Float, will have nothing to do, but to take up the Breach-&s;tones, which are brought to them by the other Labourers, and roll
<PB N="29" REF="31">
them gently over the &s;ide of the Float <HI>down into the Water</HI>.</P>
<P>Their great <HI>Weight</HI>, for they are, as was &s;aid be|fore, exact Squares of two Foot every way, which is <HI>Eight Foot &s;olid</HI>, will, in &s;pite of the Rapidity, and Depth of the Stream, carry them <HI>down</HI>, with very little &s;loping, <HI>to the Bottom of the Channel</HI>; and when they are <HI>there</HI>, the &s;ame weight will be &s;ure to keep them <HI>&s;teddy</HI>; and <HI>other Breach-&s;tones</HI> falling pre&s;ently after them, will lie either <HI>near</HI>, or <HI>upon them</HI>, and &s;o as the <HI>Number, let fall</HI>, grows <HI>greater</HI>, the <HI>Ridge</HI>, they will make, becomes <HI>higher</HI>, and con&s;equently <HI>weaker</HI>; and the Force of the Stream, gaining Power enough to <HI>overturn</HI> it, will do &s;ervice to the Work: For the Stones, which are &s;o overthrown by the Current, mu&s;t fall &s;ome|times to the Right, and &s;ometimes to the Left, and they will by that means <HI>always cover new Ground</HI>, within the compa&s;s of the de&s;ign'd Bank, and &s;o <HI>by widening the Work</HI>, afford a Foundation for a Super&s;tructure of the &s;ame kind, which by be|coming <HI>&s;till broader and broader</HI>, will at la&s;t be too &s;trong for the whole Force of the Current.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be noted, that as the&s;e Breach-&s;tones will fall and fix them&s;elves, &s;ome upon their <HI>Points</HI>, others upon their <HI>Flats</HI>, and &s;ome again upon their <HI>Edges</HI>; &s;o they will naturally leave large <HI>Hollows</HI>, and con&s;iderable Vacancies between Stone and Stone, of various Forms and Sizes: And, as the <HI>Stream</HI> in this, and all other Breaches, runs extreamly <HI>thick</HI>, and <HI>muddy</HI>, all the&s;e hollow Places will be filled by the <HI>gradual Settlings</HI> of the <HI>Mud within them</HI>; by which means the Bricks will be <HI>fix'd &s;trongly</HI> in
<PB N="30" REF="32">
their &s;everal Po&s;itions, and all <HI>join'd together</HI>, as a Wall is with Mortar.</P>
<P>This U&s;e of the thick muddy Water will be much help'd and forwarded, if with con&s;tant Re|gard to the Current of the Tide, a <HI>Liter</HI> lies at Anchor, as in the Cut, at a rea&s;onable di&s;tance from the Work, and &s;everal Men are employ'd on Board her, two or three times a Day, to &s;tir and rake up the Bottom with long Iron-pointed Poles, that &s;o the Water, being <HI>troubled</HI> more than ordinary, may convey among the Work a greater Quantity of the de&s;ir'd <HI>muddy Settlement</HI>.</P>
<P>It is plain, that in an Attempt of this kind there cou'd be &s;carce a <HI>Po&s;&s;ibility</HI> of <HI>Mi&s;carriage</HI>&punc; for every <HI>Overthrow</HI> of the <HI>Bank</HI>, the <HI>Ruin</HI> of all <HI>common</HI> Works of this Nature, wou'd be an infal|lible means of <HI>increa&s;ing its Strength</HI>, till having attain'd the Breadth of about <HI>Eighty</HI>, or a <HI>Hundred Foot</HI>, it wou'd be <HI>afterwards</HI> impo&s;&s;ible for any Force of Water to de&s;troy, or weaken it.</P>
<P>On the contrary, the <HI>&s;welling</HI> and <HI>beating</HI> of the River again&s;t it, would become of <HI>Service</HI> to the Work, when 'twas fini&s;h'd, becau&s;e every Tide wou'd of cour&s;e leave a <HI>New Coat of Mud</HI> upon the Slope, as we ob&s;erve on the &s;teep &s;helving Shores of almo&s;t all great Rivers.</P>
<P>The Work it &s;elf may, after it is once begun, be carry'd on without Intermi&s;&s;ion, till compleated, Day or Night, Summer or Winter, High-water or Low, being equally fit for this Bu&s;ine&s;s: And a &s;ufficient Quantity of the &s;quare Bricks being fir&s;t provided, we conceive that in three Weeks, or a
<PB N="31" REF="33">
Month at farthe&s;t, <HI>Dagenham Breach</HI> might be <HI>&s;e|curely &s;hut up</HI> by this ea&s;y method.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Charge</HI>, it will be nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;ay a word or two on that Head, for the Satisfacti|on of &s;ome Readers, who are not accu&s;tom'd to <HI>Computations</HI> of this kind, and po&s;&s;ibly may <HI>over|rate</HI> it in their Random Conceptions.</P>
<P>The Reader may plea&s;e to remember, what we declar'd in the foregoing Parts of this E&s;&s;ay, that in <HI>Italy</HI>, &s;uch Bricks, or larger, are us'd in the Walls of their Ca&s;tles, and Under-ground Build|ings, &s;uch as <HI>Arches</HI> and <HI>Foundations</HI>; and that the Price at the Makers is after the Rate of <HI>Five Pound a Thou&s;and</HI>; and certainly that will be more than they can fairly be reckon'd at in our Ca&s;e, when we con&s;ider that <HI>Clay</HI> for their <HI>Making</HI>, and <HI>Fuel</HI> for their <HI>Burning</HI>, the Two deare&s;t Articles, are <HI>here</HI> to be had on the <HI>Spot</HI>, and that <HI>Gratis</HI>, which in <HI>Italy</HI> is very much otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>If then we allow, that the Price of our Bricks will be <HI>Five Pounds per Thou&s;and</HI>, it only remains to compute, <HI>how many</HI> the Work will require, and what Number of <HI>Workmen</HI>.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e we will be &s;ure not to <HI>under-reckon</HI> the Charge, we will imagine the Bank to be built like a <HI>Wall</HI>, clo&s;e cemented together, and as wide at the Top as the Bottom; whereas on the contra|ry, &s;uch Banks are <HI>&s;loping both ways</HI>, and much <HI>narrowe&s;t upward</HI>; and the Breach-&s;tones <HI>not clo&s;e join'd</HI>, but kept <HI>wide</HI> by a very con&s;iderable Quan|tity of fat Earth between them. However, a Wall $span$ $ndred Foot long, One Hundred Foot

<P>This is ea&s;ily done by preparing <HI>white Clay</HI>, as the <HI>Pipemakers</HI> do, and then <HI>ca&s;ting it in Moulds</HI>, of what Bigne&s;s they plea&s;e, either Square, or of any other Figure they fancy: After which they mu&s;t <HI>Bake</HI> them to the requi&s;ite Hardne&s;s, and they will be <HI>glo&s;&s;y, white, &s;trong</HI>, and <HI>durable</HI>, and not only lighter than Stone in the Handling, but immediately ready for <HI>laying together</HI>, without any Trouble of <HI>Cutting</HI>, or <HI>Poli&s;hing</HI>.</P>

<P>Experience is the faire&s;t Confuter of Difficulties: And in An&s;wer to any &s;uch Objections as the&s;e, we need only ob&s;erve, That Sir <HI>John Winter</HI> did, long &s;ince, make Trial, and <HI>demon&s;trate</HI>, that 'tis <HI>ea&s;y</HI> to <HI>burn</HI> Bricks of any Thickne&s;s, or Form; as was plain from the huge <HI>Earthen Backs</HI>, and <HI>Fire-Hearths</HI>, which have been publickly &s;een And as for the <HI>Strength</HI>, and <HI>Duration</HI> of $uch Works, it may plainly be <HI>affirm'd</HI>, from the Pra|ctice now frequent in <HI>England</HI>, of carrying <HI>Water</HI> a great way under Ground, in Pipes made of Earth, and well <HI>luted</HI> at the Joints; which are found to re&s;i&s;t all Extremities of Weather; and

<P>_OUR Publi&s;hing the u&s;eful In&s;tru|ction, which compo&s;es this <HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI>, was owing entirely to a very <HI>odd Accident</HI>, which will be told you in the Sequel, and which, be&s;ides the <HI>particular</HI> Benefit, may afford us the Ad|vantage of this <HI>General</HI> Application, That <HI>the Negligence of Men is &s;o great, and univer&s;al, that CHANCE has a vi&s;ible Hand in the Di&s;covery of every Thing U&s;eful, or Ornamental to Life</HI>.</P>
<P>Nor will it be an unplea&s;ant Amu&s;ement, to produce a mo&s;t famous <HI>Example</HI> in the following Story.</P>
<P><HI>Gon&s;alvo Peralta</HI>, an old <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Merchant, who re&s;ided in one of the Cities of <HI>Peru</HI>, was equally remarkable for his <HI>Wealth</HI>, and his <HI>Ava|rice:</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="40">
His natural Di&s;po&s;ition to heap up his Stores, made him rigidly watchful over the Labours of his <HI>Negroes</HI>, and frequently induc'd him to <HI>puni&s;h</HI> them with a barbarous Severity.</P>
<P>One among the&s;e black Sufferers, who was either le&s;s able to <HI>bear</HI> than the re&s;t, or more apt to <HI>provoke</HI>, ran away from his Ma&s;ter's Plan|tation, and rambled, Day and Night, through the Woods, and wild Coverts of that thin-Peopled Country, under con&s;tant, and ter|rible Apprehen&s;ions to be met, or overtaken by the <HI>Guards</HI> of <HI>Light-Hor&s;e</HI>, who are &s;ent out to <HI>Patrole</HI> up and down, upon all &s;uch Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>He imagin'd one Day, that he heard at a Di|&s;tance the <HI>Approaches of Hor&s;emen</HI>, and in order to avoid them, thought it &s;afe&s;t to <HI>climb up</HI> a Mountain, on who&s;e <HI>Side</HI> he was travelling, and which <HI>ro&s;e</HI> from that Place with a <HI>horrible Steep|ne&s;s:</HI> Accordingly, with infinite Difficulty, he was got to a very con&s;iderable Height, when taking hold accidentally of a thick, &s;tubby <HI>Branch</HI>, which hung over a Rock, with De&s;ign, by its A&s;&s;i&s;tance, to help him&s;elf higher, the Tree, by his Weight, was drawn out by the Roots, and together with the <HI>Negro</HI>, roll'd down with much Swiftne&s;s to the bottom of the Mountain.</P>
<P>The poor Wretch lay long without Motion, or Sen&s;e, (the Effect of his Fright, and &s;ome
<PB N="39" REF="41">
dangerous Brui&s;es,) but when he came to him|&s;elf, he found his Hand <HI>clos'd on the Branch</HI>, which had occa&s;ion'd his Tumble, and per|ceiv'd at its Root a con&s;iderable Quantity of <HI>rich Silver Oar</HI>, which lay entangled with the Fibres.</P>
<P>He bethought him&s;elf, on a little Reflection, that this lucky Di&s;covery of a Mine of that Metal, which his Ma&s;ter was &s;o fond of, would procure him his <HI>Liberty</HI>, or &s;often at lea&s;t the <HI>Severity</HI> of his <HI>U&s;age:</HI> With this View he <HI>went back</HI>, and giving full <HI>Information</HI> of the Acci|dent, proper Searches were made; and to this <HI>&s;mall Beginning</HI>, the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Dominions owe all the Wealth, which abounds inexhau&s;ta|bly in the famous, and &s;o much envy'd <HI>Mines</HI> of <HI>Poto&s;i</HI>.</P>
<P>We have &s;horten'd the Circum&s;tances of the <HI>foregoing</HI> Relation, that we might not detain you too long from <HI>another</HI>, out of which, as we hinted before, we have taken Occa&s;ion to form the E&s;&s;ay we are about to pre&s;ent you.</P>
<P>Toward the End of that un&s;ea&s;onable <HI>Au|tumn</HI>, which happen'd la&s;t Year but one, the Wife of a Farmer, in that Part of <HI>Kent</HI> call'd the <HI>Wild</HI>, gather'd <HI>in</HI> a great Quantity of <HI>Green un|ripe Grapes</HI>, which the Sun had not Power to bring to Maturity, with De&s;ign to make <HI>Ver|juice</HI>; and to that End &s;he pre&s;s'd, and prepar'd them, as is u&s;ual in making that Liquor; but whether the <HI>Vine</HI> was of a particular <HI>Species</HI>, or
<PB N="41" REF="42">
the Grapes were grown <HI>riper</HI> than &s;he thought them, or to what <HI>other</HI> Cau&s;e it was owing, is unknown: But when, after &s;ome Months <HI>lying by</HI>, &s;he came to open her Ve&s;&s;el, and examine its Condition, the <HI>Verjuice</HI> &s;he expected, was an excellent <HI>Wine</HI>, of a high &s;prightly Reli&s;h, &s;parkling bri&s;kly in the Gla&s;s, and as clear as Rock-Water.</P>
<P>This <HI>perfect</HI>, however <HI>unexpected</HI> Operation of <HI>Nature her &s;elf</HI>, gave &s;ome Gentlemen of our Society, a convincing Demon&s;tration of what they had long believ'd po&s;&s;ible, That <HI>England</HI> wants <HI>Wine of her own</HI>, not through any <HI>Defect</HI> in her <HI>Climate</HI>, but the Omi&s;&s;ion of due <HI>Indu&s;try</HI> in her negligent <HI>Natives</HI>.</P>
<P>The <HI>Vintners</HI>, and <HI>Winecoopers</HI>, will have Rea&s;on to thank us, if we furni&s;h their Cellars without paying <HI>Cu&s;tom</HI>. And the Owners of <HI>Lands</HI>, which are fit for this Purpo&s;e, will not &s;cruple a Bumper of their <HI>Fir&s;t-born</HI> new Pro|duct, to the Health of our Society, if in the Cour&s;e of this E&s;&s;ay, we make undeniable the following Particulars: That this <HI>fortunate I&s;land</HI> is fitter than mo&s;t Parts of <HI>France</HI>, for the Pro|pagation of <HI>Vineyards:</HI> That, till about <HI>Six Hun|dred Years &s;ince</HI>, it was as common to make <HI>Wine</HI> in <HI>England</HI>, as it is now to make <HI>Malt:</HI> By what means it happen'd, that the <HI>Planting of Vineyards</HI> became <HI>di&s;continued</HI>: And how it may ea&s;ily be <HI>re&s;tored</HI> to the general Practice, &s;o that <HI>Wine</HI> may be afforded as <HI>cheap</HI>, as our <HI>Al$</HI> is at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="43">In the fir&s;t Place, 'tis true, that <HI>&s;ome Parts of France</HI>, &s;uch as <HI>Orleans, Provence</HI>, and <HI>Lan|guedoc</HI>, (which are famous for <HI>Wines</HI>,) are &s;eated much nearer the Sun, and are fitter in other Re&s;pects, than mo&s;t Parts of this <HI>I&s;land</HI>. But again, there are &s;ome of the fine&s;t <HI>French Wines</HI>, which grow about <HI>Paris, Beauvais, Diep, Arles</HI>, and <HI>Ruille:</HI> And &s;everal of the&s;e Places (as may be &s;een in the <HI>Maps</HI>) are as <HI>Nor|therly</HI> Seated, as the Latitudes of &s;ome Parts of <HI>England</HI>, particularly the <HI>South-We&s;t of Devon|&s;hire</HI>, about <HI>Dartmouth</HI>, and more e&s;pecially the I&s;lands of <HI>Guern&s;ey</HI>, and <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI>. We need not mention &s;ome Tracks of the <HI>Rhine</HI>, the <HI>Mo|&s;elle</HI>, and other Rivers in <HI>Germany</HI>, &s;o famous for the <HI>Old Hock</HI>, and <HI>Rheni&s;h</HI>, which are none of the wor&s;t Wines we deal in. It is plain, then, it is not our <HI>Di&s;tance from the Sun</HI>, which occa&s;ions this Deficiency: Let us &s;ee, if we owe it to our <HI>Air</HI>, or our <HI>Weather</HI>.</P>
<P>In both the&s;e Particulars we &s;hall find an Ad|vantage in our <HI>Favour:</HI> The Severity of the Winters in <HI>France</HI>, nay, in <HI>Italy it &s;elf</HI>, mu&s;t be own'd to be vi&s;ibly <HI>greater</HI> than in <HI>England</HI>, and their Fro&s;ts are &s;o la&s;ting, and &s;o nipping, that 'tis no <HI>rare</HI> Misfortune, to find their <HI>Vine|yards</HI> de&s;troy'd by that Means, very forward in <HI>April</HI>. On the contrary, <HI>our Winters</HI> are <HI>mild</HI>, and our <HI>Fro&s;ts</HI> much <HI>le&s;s piercing</HI>; which Bene|fits we owe to the <HI>Gro&s;sne&s;s</HI> of our <HI>Air</HI>, and our <HI>Neighbourhood</HI> to the <HI>Ocean</HI>: Neither are we &s;ubject to tho&s;e &s;trange Storms of <HI>Hail</HI> in
<PB N="42" REF="44">
the <HI>Summer</HI>, which are common in all the <HI>hot</HI> Countries of <HI>Europe</HI>; and &s;weeping, with a kind of Pe&s;tilential Sulphur, over great Tracks of Land, de&s;troy all the Grapes in their Journey: We are liable, 'tis true, to a good deal more <HI>Rain</HI> than the <HI>Continent</HI>, and &s;uperfluous <HI>Moi|&s;ture</HI> mu&s;t be own'd a great Enemy to <HI>Vine|yards:</HI> But that Inconvenience may not only be <HI>avoided</HI> by the <HI>Manner of our Planting</HI>, but is infinitely more than <HI>atton'd for</HI> by our various Advantages.</P>
<P>Thus 'tis vi&s;ible, that as to our Latitude, and the Temperature of our <HI>Climate</HI>, we are no way behind-hand with &s;ome of tho&s;e Countries, from whom we &s;upinely content our &s;elves to be furni&s;h'd with Wines, at what Rates they think fit to impo&s;e. But it is a <HI>remarkable Flaw</HI> in the <HI>Genius</HI> of our <HI>Nation</HI>, to di&s;tru&s;t new Im|provements, and believe nothing <HI>ea&s;y to be done</HI>, which is <HI>not done already</HI>; though perhaps 'tis a <HI>general Error</HI>, and infects <HI>Foreign</HI> Countries with an equal Stupidity. And our hone&s;t <HI>Un|believers</HI> may keep them&s;elves in Countenance, by remembring the Story of the <HI>Old Roman Sol|diers</HI>, who were &s;ent, as a Colony, to govern <HI>Al&s;atia</HI>, a mo&s;t <HI>Fertile</HI>, and <HI>Southerly</HI> Province of <HI>Germany</HI>. The&s;e merry <HI>old Topers</HI> had a No|tion, by &s;ome Means put into their Heads, that no <HI>Vines</HI> could grow in a Climate &s;o <HI>cold</HI>, as that they were going to, and therefore they <HI>Muti|ny'd</HI> again&s;t their <HI>Commanders</HI>, who, with no &s;mall Difficulty, brought them to believe, it was <HI>po&s;&s;ible</HI> to cultivate <HI>Vineyards</HI> in <HI>Al&s;atia</HI>, as well as in <HI>Italy</HI>. But Experience convinc'd them as
<PB N="43" REF="45">
&s;oon as they <HI>try'd</HI>; and from that Time to this, the be&s;t Vines in <HI>Europe</HI> abound in that Coun|try; from whence they have &s;pread many Hun|dred Miles more to the <HI>Northward</HI>. A Man might plea&s;antly argue from hence, that the <HI>Germans</HI>, and <HI>Italians</HI>, ow'd much of their Va|lour to the good <HI>Wine</HI>, they drank of; which we offer as a Hint, to be made u&s;e of on Occa&s;ion, when it &s;hall be objected to &s;ome hone&s;t Soldier over his Cups, that an <HI>Engli&s;h-Man can't fight with|out Beef in his Belly</HI>.</P>
<P>But &s;eriou&s;ly to return to our Subject: Other Nations take Advantage to expo&s;e us unju&s;tly, and ground their Reflections on our own Mi&s;|repre&s;entation of our Country's Fertility: What fairer Example of this can be given, than a &s;illy Ob&s;ervation we meet with in a <HI>French</HI> Book, Entituled, <HI>The Political Trea&s;ure</HI>; &s;o notoriou&s;ly fal&s;e, that 'twere downright ridi|culous to go about to confute it? <HI>It is true</HI>, &s;ays this Author, <HI>that their I&s;land of</HI> Eng|land <HI>abounds with good &s;tore of BUTTER, HARD CHEESE</HI>, and <HI>BLACK CAT|TLE; nor do they (being Peopled but thinly) find any want of BREAD-CORN among them: But were they to endeavour to propagate the Conveniences and Superflu|ities of</HI> FRANCE, <HI>they are mode&s;t enough to CONFESS, 'twou$d be labouring in vain: And this, among their other Misfortunes, is a remarkable Deficiency, That HOPS can by no Art whatever be brought to grow with them</HI>. It is no wonder, that the <HI>French</HI> think our Country incapable of <HI>Vineyards</HI>, if
<PB N="44" REF="46">
they will not allow the Poor <HI>Hop</HI> to find Nou|ri&s;hment among us.</P>
<P>But now, from the <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> we will come to the <HI>Fact</HI>, and prove, That, in old Time, Vineyards <HI>actually did</HI> thrive in <HI>England</HI>. To this Day there remains, in all Parts of this Nation, the old Name of <HI>Vineyard</HI> to pieces of Land, which have never in the Memory of Man been employ'd to that U&s;e; whence 'tis natural to argue, that they formerly <HI>were</HI> what they now bear the Name of. This, however, will pa&s;s for no more than a Pre|&s;umptive Evidence; and the Laws of our Coun|trey require clear and <HI>po&s;itive Proof</HI>, before Judg|ment.</P>
<P>The learned Mr. <HI>Cambden</HI> quotes &s;everal In&s;tan|&s;tances, to prove that many Hundred Years &s;ince, it was common for <HI>Vineyards to flouri&s;h in</HI> England. The famous old Record, call'd <HI>Dooms-day Book</HI>, which is a kind of General Survey of Church Lands, and their Product, abounds in remarkable Proofs of the Matter before us; and mentions, particularly, how many Acres of <HI>Vines</HI> grew at <HI>Ely</HI> in <HI>Cambridg&s;hire</HI>, and <HI>Leigh</HI> in the Hundreds of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>; which are both &s;o near <HI>London</HI>, that we cho&s;e tho&s;e two Places in Preference to others Further, <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Malmsbury</HI>, who liv'd before the Conque&s;t, in de&s;cribing the Ble&s;&s;ings of <HI>Eng|land</HI>, takes occa&s;ion to mention the <HI>Wine</HI>, that was every where made in his Time, with this Extraordinary <HI>Encomium</HI>, That it was <HI>equal</HI> to the <HI>French Wine</HI>, in every Thing to be <HI>lik'd</HI>, and infinitely <HI>exceeded</HI> it in this one Particu|lar,
<PB N="45" REF="47">
that it was not &s;o &s;ubject to an <HI>unplea&s;ant Tartne&s;s</HI>.</P>
<P>This may &s;erve to convince the mo&s;t diffident, that <HI>once we had Wine made among us</HI>: It remains to give a Gue&s;s at the Cau&s;e, <HI>why it was not con|tinued to our Time</HI>. And this appears ea&s;y from <HI>Circum&s;tances</HI> to be met with in our <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI>; and the <HI>Con&s;equences</HI>, which may be rea&s;ona|bly &s;ubjoin'd, as the Natural <HI>Effects</HI> of &s;uch <HI>Cau&s;es</HI>.</P>
<P>When <HI>William the Conqueror</HI>, by his Acqui&s;iti|on of <HI>England</HI>, annex'd to its Dominions the Duke|dom of <HI>Normandy</HI>, and its &s;pacious Dependancies, it is rea&s;onable to believe, that Him&s;elf, and his Succe&s;&s;ors, did, by all means, endeavour to e&s;ta|bli&s;h a good Corre&s;pondence, and mutual Affecti|on between his <HI>New</HI> People and his <HI>Old</HI>. The mo&s;t effectual way to do this, was, by &s;ome means or other, to make <HI>England</HI> beholden to his Native Dominions, for a yearly Supply of &s;ome Product we wou'd <HI>lea&s;t Care to want</HI>: Our Ance&s;tors are recorded for a <HI>fam'd Ho&s;pitality:</HI> The want of good <HI>Wine</HI>, that Support of good <HI>Humour</HI>, cou'd never be brook'd by Men &s;o di&s;pos'd; wherefore it was but to <HI>find &s;ome Pretence for de&s;troying the Vineyards of</HI> England; and it was a Con&s;e|quence that the Merchants of <HI>Ga&s;coign</HI>, and other <HI>French</HI> Provinces, might pour in upon us a yearly Inundation of <HI>Wine</HI>, to &s;upply the De|mands which the <HI>Law</HI> made it <HI>penal</HI> to furni&s;h <HI>at Home</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="48">Pretences cou'd never be wanting, to make this go down with the Multitude, as a <HI>National Bene|fit</HI>; the <HI>Encouragement of Trade</HI>; the <HI>Increa&s;e of Navigation</HI>; the greater <HI>Aptne&s;s of Soil</HI> in tho&s;e Countries, and the <HI>Witchcraft</HI> of <HI>Novelty</HI>: All the&s;e, and a great many more &s;uch Inducements, were &s;ufficient to quiet the Clamour of the Peo|ple, who were mo&s;t <HI>immediately Sufferers</HI>, by the De&s;truction of their Vineyards: And the di&s;con|tinuance of Planting them, being once grown a <HI>Cu&s;tom</HI>, Length of Time, wearing out the Remem|brance of the <HI>Truth</HI>, the Di&s;tinction is not ea&s;ily made between not being <HI>able</HI>, and not being <HI>&s;uf|fer'd</HI>.</P>
<P>There is nothing <HI>&s;urprizing</HI>, or <HI>improbable</HI> in this Imagination; and it is not yet out of &s;ome Peoples Remembrance, when a <HI>Step very like it</HI> w$ $ken, and the Growth of <HI>Tobacco</HI> in <HI>England</HI> was put down by Act of Parliament, for Advance|ment of <HI>Trade</HI>, and Encouragement of <HI>Virginia</HI>; tho' many of our Countries, and <HI>Glouce&s;ter&s;hire</HI> in particular, did not only produce Tobacco more plea&s;ant, and fit for our Con&s;titutions, but by that means made more Profit of their Lands, beyond all Compari&s;on, than by any other U&s;e they cou'd put them to.</P>

it will generally be believ'd, that the <HI>Cli|mate of</HI> England <HI>is unfit for Tobacco</HI>, and that <HI>there|fore</HI> they are forc'd, at &s;uch a yearly Expence, to be &s;upply'd from <HI>America</HI>.</P>
<P>But whatever may be thought of the <HI>Vineyards of old</HI>, the Matter in Hand will be out of Di&s;pute, if the Reader informs him&s;elf, which he ea&s;ily may, That even <HI>at this very time there are Vine|yards in</HI> England, from whence has been made mo&s;t agreeable <HI>Wine</HI>, in Quantity &s;ufficient to furni&s;h a great deal to the <HI>Vintners</HI> of <HI>London</HI>: As a Proof of which Fact, we need only men|tion Sir <HI>William Ba&s;&s;et</HI>'s known <HI>Vineyard</HI> near the <HI>Bath</HI>, Mr. <HI>Howard</HI>'s by <HI>Darking</HI> in <HI>Surry</HI>, and that of Sir <HI>John Mordaunt</HI> of <HI>Blackheath</HI> near <HI>London</HI>.</P>
<P>But tho' the&s;e, and &s;ome others, do often <HI>hit well</HI>, they are many times ob&s;erv'd, and e&s;peci|ally in un&s;ea&s;onable Years, to <HI>deceive</HI> very much the <HI>Expectation</HI> of their <HI>Owners</HI>; which Di&s;appoint|ments ari&s;e from <HI>two</HI> Principal <HI>Cau&s;es</HI>; their not chu&s;ing <HI>Grapes</HI> the mo&s;t <HI>fit</HI> for our Climate, and their Planting the <HI>Vines</HI> in a <HI>manner as im|proper</HI>.</P>
<P>If any Man therefore wou'd <HI>&s;ucce&s;sfully</HI> nou|ri&s;h a Vineyard, he need only give him&s;elf the Trouble of <HI>ob&s;erving</HI> the Directions which fol|low.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="50" MS="Y">The <HI>Situation</HI> &s;hou'd face the <HI>South-Ea&s;t</HI>, o$ <HI>South-We&s;t</HI>; the <HI>Soil</HI> &s;hou'd be <HI>Gravelly, Light, Sandy</HI>, or <HI>Stony</HI>; the Side of a <HI>Hill</HI> &s;hould be cho|&s;en, if po&s;&s;ible, but <HI>plain</HI> Ground, in <HI>our</HI> way, will be almo&s;t as &s;erviceable.</P>
<P>The <HI>Grapes</HI>, which are <HI>proper for England</HI>, are &s;uch as are <HI>earlie&s;t</HI> ripe, mo&s;t naturally <HI>hardy</HI>, and have &s;mall jagged Leaves, which <HI>&s;hade</HI> not too much, but let in the <HI>Sun</HI> with a double Re|fre&s;hment; &s;uch as the&s;e are the <HI>Canada Grape</HI>, the <HI>Vine</HI> of the <HI>Rhine</HI>; the &s;mall <HI>Mu&s;cadel</HI>, and above all, that &s;ort which abounds in the Vine|yards, which lie every where round the City of <HI>Paris</HI>, from whence we may be furni&s;h'd with well rooted Setts for about <HI>Six-Pence the Hun|dred</HI>, not reckoning in the Charge of <HI>bringing them over</HI>.</P>
<P>But we wou'd recommend, in&s;tead of the&s;e <HI>&s;mall Setts</HI>, which are commonly bought, the U&s;e of large full grown Roots, which are yearly cut up and thrown away about <HI>Paris</HI>, for the $in$ng their Vineyards: For the&s;e may not only $he had at as rea&s;onable a Price as the other bu$ being pack'd up in Boxes, with Earth thrown between them, will come over without mu$ $pence&punc; &s;ince <HI>four Hundred</HI> &s;uch Roots are &s;ufficient to plant a whole <HI>Acre</HI>; but will al&s;o &s;hoot &s;trongly, and bear Fruit the <HI>fir&s;t Summer</HI>&punc; whereas on the contrary, the <HI>&s;mall Setts</HI>, which are <HI>commonly planted</HI>, bear nothing at all in <HI>$ee Years</HI>, and even <HI>then</HI> produce <HI>&s;paringly</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="51">The&s;e Roots mu&s;t be planted in long &s;hal|low Trenches, at the di&s;tance of Ten Foot one from the other; and the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing Branches, as they ri&s;e, mu&s;t be &s;uffer'd to run, like our Peaches and Apricots, on the mo&s;t Sun|ny &s;ide of a low &s;light Wall, about Three Foot in Heighth, till they meet one another; after which, all &s;uperfluous Shoots mu&s;t be kept down by Pruning; and if the Top of the Walls were made to <HI>hang over</HI>, by being built about Three Inches broader than the re&s;t, they wou'd afford an infallible Security again&s;t all the <HI>Bla&s;ts</HI>, and ill Accidents, which frequently ruin an <HI>un|guarded</HI> Vineyard.</P>
<P>The Walls will by no means be &s;o expen&s;ive as may be thought, becau&s;e they are built of the <HI>Pebbles, Flints</HI>, and rough <HI>Stones</HI>, which are eve|ry $ere found <HI>upon the Spot</HI>, in Lands pro|per for <HI>Vine-bearing</HI>, and plai&s;ter'd together with common <HI>Clay</HI> and Water: They mu&s;t be built about Eight or Ten Foot from each other, &s;o as one may not &s;uffer by the Shadow of its Neighbour. They &s;hou'd &s;tand in &s;uch man|ner, that the <HI>Allies</HI> between them may be open all Day to the <HI>Cour&s;e of the Sun</HI>, and by that means the Vines will be al&s;o defended by the Walls at their Backs, from all noxious <HI>Winds</HI>, which might otherwi&s;e injure them: The Al|lies &s;hould be cover'd, till within a Foot of the Vines, with a &s;mooth <HI>Coat</HI> of <HI>Gravel</HI>, or <HI>Sand</HI>, or <HI>hard Stones</HI>, roll'd in, and kept free on the Surface from Gra&s;s, Weeds, or any
<PB N="50" REF="52">
Growth whatever: All which is pre&s;ented to the Eye, as correctly as cou'd be <HI>drawn</HI>, in the Cut which is prefix'd to this <HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI>.</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>Vines</HI>, being &s;helter'd from <HI>Winds</HI>, kept warm from all <HI>Fro&s;ts</HI>, not &s;uffer'd to <HI>wa&s;t</HI> them&s;elves by unprofitable &s;hooting, but kept <HI>low</HI>, and within the full Influence of the S$'s &s;trong <HI>Reflection</HI> from the <HI>Walls</HI>, and the <HI>Al|lies</HI>, will be Proof again&s;t any of the ordina|ry Accidents, and Annually produce you a plen|tiful Vintage, before the &s;hort Days, and lo&s;t Vigor of the Sun, can di&s;courage them in ri|pening.</P>
<P>It may po&s;&s;ibly be a <HI>Spur</HI> to the <HI>Undertaking</HI>, if be&s;ides the great <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI>, which wou'd fol|low this Improvement, we ob&s;erve what a <HI>Pro|fit</HI> woud, as &s;urely, attend it.
