<PB N="2" REF="4">
<P>&sect; I. WHEN the parliament met in October,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK I. 1703.</NOTE> the
Queen in her &s;peech took notice of the de|claration
by the Duke of Savoy, and the treaty with Por|tugal,
as circum&s;tances advantageous to the alliance. She
told them, that although no provi&s;ion was made for the
<PB N="3" REF="5">
expedition to Li&s;bon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VIII. 1703.</NOTE> and the augmentation of the land|forces,
the funds had an&s;wered &s;o well, and the produce
of prizes been &s;o con&s;iderable, that the public had not run
in debt by tho&s;e additional &s;ervices: that &s;he had contri|buted
out of her own revenue to the &s;upport of the circle
of Suabia, who&s;e firm adherence to the intere&s;t of the
allies de&s;erved her &s;ea&s;onable a&s;&s;i&s;tance. She &s;aid, &s;he
would not engage in any unnece&s;&s;ary expen&s;e of her own,
that &s;he might have the more to &s;pare towards the ca&s;e of
her &s;ubjects. She recommended di&s;patch and union, and
earne&s;tly exhorted them to avoid any heats or divi&s;ions
that might give encouragement to the common enemies
of the church and &s;tate. Notwith&s;tanding this admoni|tion,
and the addre&s;&s;es of both Hou&s;es, in which they
promi&s;ed to avoid all divi&s;ions, a motion was made in the
Hou&s;e of Commons for renewing the bill again&s;t occa|&s;ional
conformity, and carried by a great majority. In
the new draught, however, the penalties were lowered,
and the &s;evere&s;t clau&s;es mitigated. As the court no longer
intere&s;ted it&s;elf in the &s;ucce&s;s of this mea&s;ure, the Hou&s;e
was pretty equally divided with re&s;pect to the &s;peakers,
and the debates on each &s;ide were maintained with equal
&s;pirit and ability: at length it pa&s;&s;ed, and was &s;ent up to
the Lords, who handled it &s;till more &s;everely. It was op|po&s;ed
by a &s;mall majority of the bi&s;hops, and particularly
by Burnet of Sarum, who declaimed again&s;t it, as a
&s;cheme of the papi&s;ts to &s;et the church and prote&s;tants
at variance. It was &s;ucce&s;&s;ively attacked by the Duke of
Devon&s;hire, the Earl of Pembroke, the Lords Haver&s;ham,
Mohun, Ferrars, and Wharton. Prince George of Den|mark
ab&s;ented him&s;elf from the Hou&s;e; and the que&s;|tion
being put for a &s;econd reading, it was carried in the
negative: yet the Duke of Marlborough and Lord Go|dolphin
entered their di&s;&s;ent again&s;t its being rejected,
though the former had po&s;itively declared, that he thought
the bill un&s;ea&s;onable. The Commons having peru&s;ed
a copy of the treaty with Portugal, voted forty thou|&s;and
men, including five thou&s;and marines, for the &s;ea-&s;ervice
<PB N="4" REF="6">
of the en&s;uing year; and a like number of land|forces,
to act in conjunction with the allies, be&s;ides the
additional ten thou&s;and: they likewi&s;e re&s;olved, That the
proportion to be employed in Portugal &s;hould amount to
eight thou&s;and. Sums were granted for the maintenance
of the&s;e great armaments, as well as for the &s;ub&s;idies pay|able
to her Maje&s;ty's allies; and funds appointed equal to
the occa&s;ion. Then they a&s;&s;ured the Queen, in an addre&s;s,
that they would provide for the &s;upport of &s;uch alliances
as &s;he had made, or &s;hould make, with the Duke of
Savoy.</P>
<P>&sect; II. At this period the nation was alarmed by the de|tection
of a con&s;piracy &s;aid to be hatched by the Jacobites
of Scotland. Simon Fra&s;er Lord Lovat, a man of de&s;pe|rate
enterpri&s;e, profound di&s;&s;imulation, abandoned morals,
and ruined fortune, who had been outlawed for having
ravi&s;hed a &s;i&s;ter of the Marquis of Athol, was the per&s;on to
whom the plot &s;eems to have owed it's origin. He repaired
to the court of St. Germain's, where he undertook to a&s;|&s;emble
a body of twelve thou&s;and Highlanders to act in
favour of the Pretender, if the court of France would
a&s;&s;i&s;t them with a &s;mall reinforcement of troops, together
with officers, arms, ammunition, and money. The
French King &s;eemed to li&s;ten to the propo&s;al; but, as
Fra&s;er's character was infamous, he doubted his veracity.
He was, therefore, &s;ent back to Scotland with two other
per&s;ons, who were in&s;tructed to learn the &s;trength and
&s;entiments of the clans, and endeavour to engage &s;ome of
the nobility in the de&s;ign of an in&s;urrection. Fra&s;er no
&s;ooner returned than he privately di&s;covered the whole
tran&s;action to the Duke of Queen&s;berry, and undertook to
make him acquainted with the whole corre&s;pondence be|tween
the Pretender and the Jacobites. In con&s;equence of
this &s;ervice he was provided with a pa&s;s, to &s;ecure him
from all pro&s;ecution; and made a progre&s;s through the
Highlands, to $ound the inclination of the chieftains.
Before he &s;et out on this circuit, he delivered to the Duke
a letter from the Queen Dowager at St. Germain's, di|rected
<PB N="5" REF="7">
to the Marquis of Athol: it was couched in general
terms, and &s;uper&s;cribed in a different character; &s;o that,
in all probability, Fra&s;er had forged the direction, with a
view to ruin the Marquis, who had pro&s;ecuted him for
the injury done to his &s;i&s;ter. He propo&s;ed a &s;econd journey
to France, where he &s;hould be able to di&s;cover other more
material circum&s;tances; and the Duke of Queen&s;berry
procured a pa&s;s for him to go to Holland from the Earl of
Nottingham, though it was expedited under a borrowed
name. The Duke had communicated his di&s;covery to the
Queen, without di&s;clo&s;ing his name, which he de&s;ired
might be concealed: her Maje&s;ty believed the particulars,
which were confirmed by her &s;pies at Paris, as well as by
the evidence of Sir John Maclean, who had really been
conveyed from France to England in an open boat, and
apprehended at Folk&s;tone. This gentleman pretended at
fir&s;t, that his intention was to go through England to his
own country, in order to take the benefit of the Queen's
pardon; and this, in all probability, was his real de&s;ign:
but, being given to under&s;tand that he would be treated
in England as a traitor, unle&s;s he &s;hould merit forgive|ne&s;s,
by making important di&s;coveries, he related all he
knew of the purpo&s;ed in&s;urrection. From his informa|tion
the mini&s;try gave directions for apprehending one
Keith, who&s;e uncle had accompanied Fra&s;er from France,
and knew all the intrigues of the court of St. Germain's.
He declared, that there was no other de&s;ign on foot, except
that of paving the way for the Pretender's a&s;cending the
throne after the Queen's decea&s;e. Fergu&s;on, that veteran
con&s;pirator, affirmed that Fra&s;er had been employed by
the Duke of Queen&s;berry to decoy &s;ome per&s;ons whom he
hated into a con&s;piracy, that he might have an opportu|nity
to effect their ruin; and by the di&s;covery e&s;tabli&s;h
his own credit, which began to totter. Perhaps there was
too much rea&s;on for this imputation. Among tho&s;e who
were &s;ei&s;ed at this time, was a gentleman of the name of
Lind&s;ay, who had been under-&s;ecretary to the Earl of
Middleton. He had returned from France to Scotland, in
<PB N="6" REF="8">
order to take the benefit of the Queen's pardon, under the
&s;helter of which he came to England, thinking him&s;elf
&s;ecure from pro&s;ecution. He prote&s;ted he knew of no
de&s;igns again&s;t the Queen or her government; and that
he did not believe &s;he would ever receive the lea&s;t injury or
mole&s;tation from the court of St. Germain's. The Hou&s;e
of Lords having received intimation of this con&s;piracy,
re&s;olved, That a commi$tee &s;hould be appointed to exa|mine
into the particulars; and ordered, That Sir John
Maclean &s;hould be next day brought to their Hou&s;e. The
Queen, who was far from being plea&s;ed with this in&s;tance
of their officious interpo&s;ition, gave them to under&s;tand by
me&s;&s;age, that &s;he thought it would be inconvenient to
change the method of examination already begun; and
that &s;he would in a &s;hort time inform the Hou&s;e of the
whole affair. On the &s;eventeenth day of December the
Queen went to the Hou&s;e of Peers, and having pa&s;&s;ed the
bill for the land-tax, made a &s;peech to both Hou&s;es, in
which &s;he declared, that &s;he had unque&s;tionable informa|tion
of ill practices and de&s;igns carried on by the emi&s;&s;a|ries
of France in Scotland. The Lords per&s;i&s;ting in their
re&s;olution to bring the enquiry into their own Hou&s;e, cho&s;e
their &s;elect committee by ballot; and, in an addre&s;s, thanked
her Maje&s;ty for the information &s;he had been plea&s;ed to
communicate.</P>
<P>&sect; III. The Commons taking it for granted that the
Queen was di&s;obliged at the&s;e proceedings of the Upper
Hou&s;e, which, indeed, implied an in&s;ult upon her mini&s;try,
if not upon her&s;elf, pre&s;ented an addre&s;s, declaring them|&s;elves
&s;urpri&s;ed to find, that when per&s;ons &s;u&s;pected of
trea&s;onable practices were taken into cu&s;tody by her Ma|je&s;ty's
me&s;&s;engers, in order to be examined, the Lords, in
violation to the known laws of the land, had wre&s;ted
them out of her hands, and arrogated the examination
&s;olely to them&s;elves; &s;o that a due enquiry into the evil
practices and de&s;igns again&s;t her Maje&s;ty's per&s;on and
government might, in a great mea&s;ure, be ob&s;tructed.
They earne&s;tly de&s;ired, that &s;he would &s;uffer no diminu|tion
<PB N="7" REF="9">
of the prerogative; and they a&s;&s;ured her they would,
to the utmo&s;t of their power, &s;upport her in the exerci&s;e
of it at home, as well as in a&s;&s;erting it again&s;t all inva&s;ions
what&s;oever. The Queen thanked them for their concern
and a&s;&s;urances; and was not ill plea&s;ed at the nature of
the addre&s;s, though the charge again&s;t the Peers was not
&s;trictly true; for there were many in&s;tances of their hav|ing
a&s;&s;umed &s;uch a right of enquiry. The Upper Hou&s;e
deeply re&s;ented the accu&s;ation. They declared, that by
the known laws and cu&s;toms of parliament, they had an
undoubted right to take examinations of per&s;ons charged
with criminal matters, whether tho&s;e per&s;ons were, or
were not in cu&s;tody. They re&s;olved, That the addre&s;s
of the Commons was unparliamentary, groundle&s;s, with|out
precedent, highly injurious to the Hou&s;e of Peers,
tending to interrupt the good corre&s;pondence between the
two Hou&s;es, to create an ill opinion in her Maje&s;ty of
the Hou&s;e of Peers, of dangerous con&s;equence to the li|berties
of the people, the con&s;titution of the kingdom, and
privileges of parliament. They pre&s;ented a long remon|&s;trance
to the Queen, ju&s;tifying their own conduct, ex|plaining
the &s;teps they had taken, recriminating upon the
Commons, and expre&s;&s;ing the mo&s;t &s;ervent zeal, duty,
and affection to her Maje&s;ty. In her an&s;wer to this re|pre&s;entation,
which was drawn up with elegance, propri|ety,
and preci&s;ion, &s;he profe&s;&s;ed her &s;orrow for the mi&s;|under&s;tanding
which had happened between the two
Hou&s;es of Parliament, and thanked them for the concern
they had expre&s;&s;ed for the rights of the crown and the pre|rogative,
which &s;he &s;hould never exert &s;o willingly as for
the good of her &s;ubjects, and the protection of their liberties.</P>
<P>&sect; IV. Among other per&s;ons &s;ei&s;ed on the coa&s;t of Su&s;&s;ex,
on their landing from France, was one Boucher, who,
had been aide-du-camp to the Duke of Berwick. This
man, when examined, denied all knowledge of any con|&s;piracy:
he &s;aid, that being weary of living &s;o long
abroad, and having made &s;ome un&s;ucce&s;sful attempts to
obtain a pa&s;s, he had cho&s;en rather to ca&s;t him&s;elf on the
<PB N="8" REF="10">
Queen's mercy, than to remain longer in exile from his
native country. He was tried and condemned for high|trea&s;on,
yet continued to declare him&s;elf ignorant of the
plot. He proved, that in the war of Ireland, as well as
in Flanders, he had treated the Engli&s;h pri&s;oners with
great humanity. The Lords de&s;i&s;ted from the pro&s;ecution;
he obtained a reprieve, and died in Newgate. On the
twenty-ninth day of January the Earl of Nottingham told
the Hou&s;e, that the Queen had commanded him to lay
before them the papers containing all the particulars hi|therto
di&s;covered of the con&s;piracy in Scotland; but that
there was one circum&s;tance which could not yet be pro|perly
communicated, without running the ri&s;que of pre|venting
a di&s;covery of greater importance. They forth|with
drew up and pre&s;ented an addre&s;s, de&s;iring, that all
the papers might be immediately &s;ubmitted to their in|&s;pection.
The Queen &s;aid &s;he did not expect to be pre&s;&s;ed
in this manner immediately after the declaration &s;he had
made; but in a few days the Earl of Nottingham deli|vered
the papers &s;ealed to the Hou&s;e, and all the Lords
were &s;ummoned to attend on the eighth day of February,
that they might be opened and peru&s;ed. Nottingham was
&s;u&s;pected of a de&s;ign to &s;ti&s;le the con&s;piracy. Complaint
was made in the Hou&s;e of Commons, that he had di&s;|charged
an officer belonging to the late King James, who
had been &s;ei&s;ed by the governour of Berwick. A warm
debate en&s;ued, and at length ended in a re&s;olve, That the
Earl of Nottingham, one of her Maje&s;ty's principal &s;ecre|taries
of &s;tate, for his great ability and diligence in the
execution of his o$$ice, for his unque&s;tionable fidelity to
the Queen and her government, and for his &s;teady adher|ing
to the church of England as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed, highly
merited the tru&s;t her Maje&s;ty had repo&s;ed in him. They
ordered the Speaker to pre&s;ent this re&s;olution to the
Queen, who &s;aid, &s;he was glad to find them &s;o well &s;a|tisfied
with the Earl of Nottingham, who was tru&s;ted by
her in &s;o con&s;iderable an office. They peru&s;ed the exami|nations
of the witne&s;&s;es which were laid before them,
<PB N="9" REF="11">
without pa&s;&s;ing judgment, or offering advice on the &s;ub|ject:
but they thanked her Maje&s;ty for having communi|cated
tho&s;e particulars, as well as for her wi&s;dom and care
of the nation. When the Lords proceeded with uncom|mon
eagerne&s;s in their enquiry, the Lower Hou&s;e, in ano|ther
addre&s;s, renewed their complaints again&s;t the conduct
of the peers, which they &s;till affirmed was without a pre|cedent.
But this was the language of irritated faction, by
which indeed both &s;ides were equally actuated.</P>
<P>&sect; V. The &s;elect committee of the Lords pro&s;ecuted the
enquiry, and founded their report chiefly on the confe&s;&s;ion
of Sir John Maclean, who owned, that the court of
St. Germain's had li&s;tened to Lovat's propo&s;al: that
&s;everal councils had been held at the Pretender's court on
the &s;ubject of an inva&s;ion; and that per&s;ons were &s;ent
over to &s;ound &s;ome of the nobility in Scotland. But the
nature of their private corre&s;pondence and negociation
could not be di&s;covered. Keith had tampered with his
uncle to di&s;clo&s;e the whole &s;ecret; and this was the cir|cum&s;tance
which the Queen declined imparting to the
Lords, until &s;he &s;hould know the &s;ucce&s;s of his endea|vours,
which proved ineffectual. The uncle &s;tood aloof;
and the mini&s;try did not heartily engage in the enquiry.
The Hou&s;e of Lords having fini&s;hed the&s;e examinations,
and being warmed with violent debates, voted, That there
had been dangerous plots between &s;ome per&s;ons in Scot|land
and the courts of France and St. Germain's; and,
That the encouragement for this plotting aro&s;e from the
not &s;ettling the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown of Scotland in the
Hou&s;e of Hanover. The&s;e votes were &s;ignified to the
Queen in an addre&s;s; and they promi&s;ed, that when the
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion &s;hould be thus &s;ettled, they would endeavour to
promote the union of the two kingdoms upon ju&s;t and
rea&s;onable terms. Then they compo&s;ed another repre&s;en|tation,
in an&s;wer to the &s;econd addre&s;s of the Commons,
touching their proceedings. They charged the Lower
Hou&s;e with want of zeal in the whole progre&s;s of this
enquiry. They produced a great number of precedents,
<PB N="10" REF="12">
to prove that their conduct had been regular and parlia|mentary;
and they, in their turn, accu&s;ed the Commons
of partiality and inju&s;tice in vacating legal elections. The
Queen, in an&s;wer to this remon&s;trance, &s;aid, &s;he looked
upon any mi&s;under&s;tanding between the two Hou&s;es as a
very great misfortune to the kingdom; and that &s;he &s;hould
never omit any thing in her power to prevent all occa&s;ions
of them for the future.</P>
<P>&sect; VI. The Lords and Commons, animated by &s;uch
oppo&s;ite principles, &s;ei&s;ed every opportunity of thwarting
each other. An action having been brought by one
Matthew A&s;hby again&s;t William White, and the other
con&s;tables of Ayle&s;bury, for having denied him the privi|lege
of voting in the la&s;t election, the cau&s;e was tried at
the a&s;&s;izes, and the con&s;tables were ca&s;t with damages.
But an order was given in the Queen's-Bench to qua&s;h
all the proceedings, &s;ince no action had ever been brought
on that account. The cau&s;e being moved by writ of error
into the Hou&s;e of Lords, was argued with great warmth:
at length it was carried by a great majority, that the order
of the Queen's-Bench &s;hould be &s;et a&s;ide, and judgment
pronounced according to the verdict given at the a&s;&s;izes.
The Commons con&s;idered the&s;e proceedings as encroach|ments
on their privileges. They pa&s;&s;ed five different re&s;o|lutions,
importing, That the Commons of England in
parliament a&s;&s;embled had the &s;ole right to examine and
determine all matters relating to the right of election of
their own members: That the practice of determining
the qualifications of electors in any court of law would
expo&s;e all mayors, bailiffs, and returning-officers, to a
multiplicity of vexatious &s;uits, and in &s;upportable expen&s;es,
and &s;ubject them to di$$erent and independent juri&s;dictions,
as well as to incon&s;i&s;tent determinations in the &s;ame ca&s;e,
without relief: That Matthew A&s;hby was guilty of a
breach of privilege, as were all attornies, &s;ollicitors, coun|&s;ellors,
and &s;erjeants at law, &s;olliciting, pro&s;ecuting, or
pleading, in any ca&s;e of the &s;ame nature. The&s;e re&s;olu|tions,
&s;igned by the clerk, were fixed upon the gate of
<PB N="11" REF="13">
We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall. On the other hand, the Lords ap|pointed
a committee to draw up a &s;tate of the ca&s;e; and,
upon their report, re&s;olved, That every per&s;on being
wilfully hindered to exerci&s;e his right of voting, might
maintain an action in the Queen's courts again&s;t the officer
by whom his vote &s;hould be refu&s;ed, to a&s;&s;ert his right, and
recover damage for the injury: That an a&s;&s;ertion to the
contrary was de&s;tructive of the property of the &s;ubjects,
again&s;t the freedom of elections, and manife&s;tly tended
to the encouragement of partiality and corruption: That
the declaring Matthew A&s;hby guilty of a breach of privi|lege
of the Hou&s;e of Commons was an unprecedented
attempt upon the judicature of parliament, and an attempt
to &s;ubject the law of England to the votes of the Hou&s;e of
Commons. Copies of the ca&s;e, and the&s;e re&s;olutions, were
&s;ent by the Lord-keeper to all the &s;heriffs of England, to be
circulated through all the boroughs of their re&s;pective
counties.</P>
<P>&sect; VII. On the &s;eventh day of February the Queen or|dered
Secretary Hedges to tell the Hou&s;e of Commons,
that &s;he had remitted the arrears of the tenths to the poor
clergy: that &s;he would grant her whole revenue ari&s;ing
out of the fir&s;t-fruits and tenths, as far as it &s;hould be|come
free from incumbrance, as an augmentation of their
maintenance: that if the Hou&s;e of Commons could find
any method by which her intentions to the poor clergy
might be made more effectual, it would be an advantage
to the publick, and acceptable to her Maje&s;ty. The
Commons immediately brought in a bill, enabling her to
alienate this branch of the revenue, and create a corpora|tion
by charter, to direct the application of it to the u&s;es
propo&s;ed: they likewi&s;e repealed the &s;tatute of Mortmain,
&s;o far as to allow all men to bequeath by will, or grant by
deed, any &s;um they &s;hould think &s;it to give towards the
augmentation of benefices. Addre&s;&s;es of thanks and ac|knowledgement
from all the elergy of England were pre|&s;ented
to the Queen for her gracious bounty: but very
little regard was paid to Burnet, Bi&s;hop of Sarum, al|though
<PB N="12" REF="14">
the Queen declared that prelate author of the
project. He was generally hated either as a Scot, a low-church-man,
or a meddling parti&s;an.</P>
<P>&sect; VIII. In March an enquiry into the condition of the
navy was begun in the Hou&s;e of Lords. They de&s;ired
the Queen, in an addre&s;s, to give &s;peedy and effectual
orders, that a number of &s;hips &s;ufficient for the home-&s;ervice
&s;hould be equipped and manned with all po&s;&s;ible
expedition. They re&s;olved, That Admiral Graydon's not
attacking the four French &s;hips in the channel had been a
prejudice to the Queen's &s;ervice, and a di&s;grace to the
nation: That his pre&s;&s;ing men in Jamaica, and his &s;eve|rity
towards ma&s;ters of merchant ve&s;&s;els and tran&s;ports, had
been a great di&s;couragement to the inhabitants of that
i&s;land, as well as prejudicial to her Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice; and
they pre&s;ented the addre&s;s again&s;t him, in con&s;equence of
which he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. They examined the accounts of
the Earl of Orford, again&s;t which great clamour had been
rai&s;ed; and, taking cognizance of the remarks made by
the commi&s;&s;ioners of the publick accounts, found them
fal&s;e in fact, ill-grounded, or of no importance. The
Commons be&s;ought the Queen to order a pro&s;ecution on
account of ill practices in the Earl of Ranelagh's office;
and they &s;ent up to the Lords a bill for continuing the
commi&s;&s;ion on the publick accounts. Some alterations
were made in the Upper Hou&s;e, e&s;pecially in the nomina|tion
of Commi&s;&s;ioners; but the&s;e were rejected by the
Commons. The Peers adhering to their amendments,
the bill dropped, and the commi&s;&s;ion expired. No other
bill of any con&s;equence pa&s;&s;ed in this &s;e&s;&s;ion, except an
act for rai&s;ing recruits, which empowered ju&s;tices of the
peace to impre&s;s idle per&s;ons for &s;oldiers and marines. On
the third day of April the Queen went to the Hou&s;e of
Peers, and having made a &s;hort &s;peech on the u&s;ual topicks
of acknowledgement, unity, and moderation, prorogued
the parliament to the fourth day of July. The divi&s;ion
&s;till continued between the two Hou&s;es of convocation;
&s;o that nothing of moment was tran&s;acted in that a&s;&s;embly,
<PB N="13" REF="15">
except their addre&s;s to the Queen upon her granting the
fir&s;t-fruits and tenths for the augmentation of &s;mall bene|fices.
At the &s;ame time, the Lower Hou&s;e &s;ent their
prolocutor with a deputation to wait upon the Speaker of
the Hou&s;e of Commons, to return their thanks to that
honourable Hou&s;e for having e&s;pou&s;ed the intere&s;t of the
clergy; and to a&s;&s;ure them that the convocation would
pur&s;ue &s;uch methods as might be&s;t conduce to the &s;upport,
honour, intere&s;t, and &s;ecurity of the church as now by
law e&s;tabli&s;hed. They &s;ent up to the archbi&s;hop and pre|lates
divers repre&s;entations, containing complaints, and
propo&s;ing canons and articles of reformation: but very
little regard was paid to their remon&s;trances.</P>
<P>&sect; IX. About this period the Earl of Nottingham, after
having ineffectually pre&s;&s;ed the Queen to di&s;card the Dukes
of Somer&s;et and Devon&s;hire, re&s;igned the &s;eals. The
Earl of Jer&s;ey and Sir Edward Seymour were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed:
the Earl of Kent was appointed chamberlain, Harley &s;e|cretary
of &s;tate, and Henry St. John &s;ecretary of war.
The di&s;covery of the Scotti&s;h con&s;piracy was no &s;ooner
known in France, than Louis ordered Fra&s;er to be im|pri&s;oned
in the Ba&s;tile. In England, Lind&s;ay being &s;en|tenced
to die for having corre&s;ponded with France, was
given to under&s;tand that he had no mercy to expect un|le&s;s
he would di&s;cover the con&s;piracy. He per&s;i&s;ted in
denying all knowledge of any &s;uch con&s;piracy; and,
&s;corned to &s;ave his life by giving fal&s;e information. In
order to intimidate him into a confe&s;&s;ion, the mini&s;try
ordered him to be conveyed to Tyburn, where he &s;till
rejected life upon the terms propo&s;ed: then he was car|ried
back to Newgate, where he remained &s;ome years: at
length he was bani&s;hed, and died of hunger in Holland.
The mini&s;ters had been &s;o lukewarm and languid in the
inve&s;tigation of the Scotti&s;h con&s;piracy, that the Whigs
loudly exclaimed again&s;t them as di&s;gui&s;ed Jacobites, and
even whi&s;pered in&s;inuations, implying, that the Queen
her&s;elf had a &s;ecret bias of &s;i&s;terly affection for the court
of St. Germain's. What &s;eemed to confirm this allega|tion,
<PB N="14" REF="16">
was the di&s;grace of the Duke of Queen&s;berry, who
had exerted him&s;elf with remarkable zeal in the detection:
but the decline of his intere&s;t in Scotland was the real cau&s;e
of his being laid a&s;ide at this juncture.</P>
<P>&sect; X. The de&s;ign of the court was to procure in the
Scotti&s;h parliament the nomination of a &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the
crown, and the &s;upply for the forces, which could not be
obtained in the preceding &s;e&s;&s;ion. Secretary John&s;ton, in
concert with the Marquis of Tweedale, undertook to
carry the&s;e points, in return for certain limitations on the
&s;ucce&s;&s;or, to which her Maje&s;ty agreed. The Marquis
was appointed commi&s;&s;ioner.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet.</NOTE> The office of lord-regi&s;ter
was be&s;towed upon John&s;ton;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi&s;t. of Q. Anne.</NOTE> and the parliament met
on the &s;ixth day of July.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feuquieres.</NOTE> The Queen, in her letter, ex|pre&s;&s;ed
her concern that the&s;e divi&s;ions &s;hould have ri&s;en
to &s;uch a height,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lockhart.</NOTE> as to encourage the enemies of the na|tion
to employ their emi&s;&s;aries for debauching her good

to grant whatever could in rea&s;on be demanded for
quieting the minds of the people.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tindal.</NOTE> She told them, &s;he had
empowered the Marquis of Tweedale to give unque&s;tion|able
proofs of her determination to maintain the govern|ment
in church and &s;tate as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed in that
kingdom;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the Admirals.</NOTE> to con&s;ent to &s;uch laws as &s;hould be found
wanting for the further &s;ecurity of both,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Voltaire.</NOTE> and for prevent|ing
all encroachments for the future.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi&s;t. of Europe.</NOTE> She earne&s;tly ex|horted
them to &s;ettle the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the prote&s;tant line,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi&s;t. of the D. of Marl|borough.</NOTE>
as a &s;tep ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for their own peace and hap|pine&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1704.</NOTE>
the quiet and &s;ecurity of all her dominions, the
reputation of her affairs abroad, and the improvement of
the prote&s;tant intere&s;t through all Europe. She declared,
that &s;he had authori&s;ed the commi&s;&s;ioner to give the royal
a&s;&s;ent to whatever could be rea&s;onably demanded, and
was in her power to grant, for &s;ecuring the &s;overeignty
and liberties of that her ancient kingdom. The remain|ing
part of the letter turned upon the nece&s;&s;ity of their
granting a &s;upply, the di&s;couragement of vice, the en|couragement
<PB N="15" REF="17">
of commerce,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VIII. 1704.</NOTE> and the u&s;ual recommendation
of moderation and unanimity.</P>
<P>&sect; XI. The Duke of Hamilton pre&s;ented a re&s;olve, That
the parliament would not name a &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the crown,
until the Scots &s;hould have concluded a previous treaty
with England, in relation to commerce and other con|cerns.
This motion produced a warm debate, in the
cour&s;e of which Fletcher of Salton expatiated upon the
hard&s;hips and mi&s;eries which the Scots had &s;u&s;tained &s;ince
the union of the two crowns under one &s;overeign, and the
impo&s;&s;ibility of bettering their condition, unle&s;s they
&s;hould take care to anticipate any de&s;ign that tended to a
continuation of the &s;ame calamities. Another re&s;olve was
produced by the Earl of Rothes, importing, That the
parliament &s;hould proceed to make &s;uch limitations and
conditions of government as might be judged proper for
rectifying the con&s;titution; for vindicating and &s;ecuring
the &s;overeignty and independency of the nation; and that
then the parliament would take into con&s;ideration the
other re&s;olve offered by the Duke of Hamilton, for a treaty
previous to the nomination of a &s;ucce&s;&s;or. This propo&s;al
was &s;econded by the court-party, and violent heats en&s;ued.
At length, Sir James Falconer, of Phe&s;do, offered an
expedient, which neither party could refu&s;e with any
&s;how of moderation. He &s;ugge&s;ted a re&s;olve, That the
parliament would not proceed to the nomination of a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or,
until the previous treaty with England &s;hould be
di&s;cu&s;&s;ed; and that it would make the nece&s;&s;ary limita|tions
and conditions of government, before the &s;ucce&s;&s;or
&s;hould be nominated. This joint-re&s;olve being put to the
vote, was carried by a great majority. The treaty with
England was neglected, and the affair of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
con&s;equently po&s;tponed. The Duke of Athol moved,
That her Maje&s;ty &s;hould be de&s;ired to &s;end down the wit|ne&s;&s;es,
and all the papers relating to the con&s;piracy, that,
after due examination, tho&s;e who were unju&s;tly accu&s;ed
might be vindicated, and the guilty puni&s;hed according
to their demerits. The commi&s;&s;ioner declared, that he
<PB N="16" REF="18">
had already written,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK. 1. 1704.</NOTE> and would write again to the Queen
on that &s;ubject. The intention of the cavaliers was to
convict the Duke of Queen&s;berry of malice and calumny
in the pro&s;ecution of that affair, that they might wreak
their vengeance upon him for that in&s;tance of his animo|&s;ity,
as well as for his having de&s;erted them in the former
&s;e&s;&s;ion. He found means, however, to per&s;uade the Queen
that &s;uch an enquiry would not only protract the &s;e&s;&s;ion,
but al&s;o divert them from the &s;ettlement of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion,
and rai&s;e &s;uch a ferment as might be productive of tragical
con&s;equences. Alarmed at the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions, &s;he re&s;olved
to prevent the examination; and gave no an&s;wer to the
repeated applications made by her parliament and mini&s;ters.
Mean while the Duke of Queen&s;berry appea&s;ed his ene|mies
in Scotland, by directing all his friends to join in the
oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>&sect; XII. The Duke of Hamilton again moved, That the
parliament &s;hould proceed to the limitations, and name
commi&s;&s;ioners to treat with England, previous to all other
bu&s;ine&s;s, except an act for a land-tax of two months, ne|ce&s;&s;ary
for the immediate &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the forces. The
Earl of Marchmont propo&s;ed an act to exclude all popi&s;h
&s;ucce&s;&s;ors; but this was warmly oppo&s;ed an un&s;ea&s;onable,
by Hamilton and his party. A bill of &s;upply being offered
by the Lord-ju&s;tice Clerk, the cavaliers tacked to it great
part of the act of &s;ecurity, to which the royal a&s;&s;ent had
been refu&s;ed in the former &s;e&s;&s;ion. Violent debates aro&s;e;
&s;o that the Hou&s;e was filled with rage and tumult. The
national &s;pirit of independence had been wrought up to a
dangerous pitch of enthu&s;ia&s;m. The &s;treets were crowded
with people of all ranks, exclaiming again&s;t Engli&s;h in|fluence;
and, threatening to &s;acrifice as traitors to their
country, all who &s;hould embrace mea&s;ures that &s;eemed to
favour a foregin intere&s;t. The commi&s;&s;ioner and his friends
were confounded and appalled. Finding it impo&s;&s;ible to
&s;tem the torrent, he, with the concurrence of the other
mini&s;ters, wrote a letter to the Queen, repre&s;enting the
uncomfortable &s;ituation of affairs, and advi&s;ing her Ma|je&s;ty
<PB N="17" REF="19">
to pa&s;s the bill, incumbered as it was with the act of
&s;ecurity. Lord Godolphin, on who&s;e council &s;he chiefly
relied, found him&s;elf involved in great perplexity. The
Tories had devoted him to de&s;truction. He fore&s;aw that
the Queen's conce&s;&s;ion to the Scots in an affair of &s;uch
con&s;equence would furni&s;h his enemies with a plau&s;ible
pretence to arraign the conduct of her mini&s;ter: but he
cho&s;e to run that ri&s;que, rather than &s;ee the army di&s;band|ed
for want of a &s;upply, and the kingdom left expo&s;ed to
an inva&s;ion. He, therefore, &s;econded the advice of the
Scotti&s;h mini&s;ters; and the Queen authori&s;ed the com|mi&s;&s;ioner
to pa&s;s the bill that was depending. This act
provided, That in ca&s;e of the Queen's dying without
i&s;&s;ue, a parliament &s;hould immediately meet, and declare
the &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the crown, different from the per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ing
the throne of England, unle&s;s before that period a
&s;ettlement &s;hould be made in parliament of the rights and
liberties of the nation, independent of Engli&s;h councils:
by another clau&s;e, they were empowered to arm and train
the &s;ubjects, &s;o as to put them in a po&s;ture of defence.
The Scotti&s;h parliament having, by a laudable exertion of
&s;pirit, obtained this act of &s;ecurity, granted the &s;upply
without further he&s;itation: but, not yet &s;atisfied with
this &s;acrifice, they engaged in debates about the con&s;pi|racy,
and the proceedings of the Hou&s;e of Lords in Eng|land,
which they termed an officious intermeddling in
their concerns, and an encroachment upon the &s;overeignty
and independency of the nation. They drew up an ad|dre&s;s
to the Queen, de&s;iring that the evidence and papers
relating to the plot might be &s;ubjected to their examination
in the next &s;e&s;&s;ion. Mean while, the commi&s;&s;ioner, dread|ing
the further progre&s;s of &s;uch an ungovernable &s;erocity,
prorogued the parliament to the &s;eventh day of October.
The act of &s;ecurity being tran&s;mitted to England, copies
of it were circulated by the enemies of Godolphin, who
repre&s;ented it as a mea&s;ure of that mini&s;ter; and the king|dom
was filled with murmurs and di&s;content. People
openly declared, that the two kingdoms were now &s;epa|rated
<PB N="18" REF="20">
by law, &s;o as never to be rejoined. Reports were
&s;pread, that great quantities of arms had been conveyed to
Scotland, and that the natives were employed in preparati|ons
to invade England. All the blame of the&s;e tran&s;acti|ons
was imputed to Lord Godolphin, whom the Tories
determined to attack, while the other party re&s;olved to
exert their whole influence for his pre&s;ervation: yet in all
probability, he owned his immediate &s;upport to the &s;ucce&s;s
of his friend the Duke of Marlborough.</P>
<P>&sect; XIII. Nothing could be more deplorable than the
&s;ituation to which the Emperor was reduced in the begin|ning
of the &s;ea&s;on. The malcontents in Hungary had
rendered them&s;elves formidable by their &s;ucce&s;s: the
Elector of Bavaria po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the places on the Danube,
as far as Pa&s;&s;au, and even threatened the city of Vienna,
which mu&s;t have been infallibly lo&s;t, had the Hungarians
and Bavarians acted in concert. By the advice of Prince
Eugene, the Emperor implored the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her Bri|tannick
Maje&s;ty; and the Duke of Marlborough ex|plained
to her the nece&s;&s;ity of undertaking his relief. This
nobleman in the month of January had cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea to
Holland, and concerted a &s;cheme with the deputies of
the States-General, for the operations of the en&s;uing cam|paign.
They agreed, that General Auverquerque &s;hould
lie upon the defen&s;ive with a &s;mall body of troops in the
Netherlands, while the main army of the allies &s;hould act
upon the Rhine, under the command of the Duke of
Marlborough. Such was the pretext under which this
con&s;ummate general concealed another plan, which was
communicated to a few only, in who&s;e di&s;cretion he could
confide. It was approved by the Pen&s;ionary and &s;ome
leading men, who &s;ecured its $avourable reception with the
States-General, when it became nece&s;&s;ary to impart the
&s;ecret to that numerous a&s;&s;embly. In the mean time, the
preparations were made, on pretence of carrying the war
to the banks of the Mo&s;ell$.</P>
<P>&sect; XIV. In the month of April, the Duke, accompa|nied
by his brother General Churchill, Lieutenant-Ge|neral
<PB N="19" REF="21">
Lumley, the Earl of Orkney, and other officers of
di&s;tinction, embarked for Holland, where he had a long
conference with a deputation of the States, concerning a
prop&s;al of &s;ending a large army towards the Mo&s;elle.
The deputies of Zealand oppo&s;ed this mea&s;ure of &s;ending
their troops to &s;uch a di&s;tance &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly, that the
Duke was obliged to tell them, in plain terms, he had re|ceived
orders to march thither with the Briti&s;h forces. He
accordingly a&s;&s;embled his army at Mae&s;tricht; and on
the eighth day of May began his march into Germany.
The French imagined his intention was to begin the
campaign with the &s;iege of Traerbach, and penetrate into
France along the Mo&s;elle. In this per&s;ua&s;ion they &s;ent a
detachment to that river; and gave out that they intended
to inve&s;t Huy, a pretence to which the Duke paid no re|gard.
He continued his route by Bedburg, Kerpenord,
Kal&s;ecken: he vi&s;ited the fortifications of Bonne, where
he received certain advice, that the recruits and re-en|forcements
for the French army in Bavaria had joined the
Elector at Villingen. He redoubled his diligence, pa&s;&s;ed
the Neckar on the third of June, and halted at Laden|burgh:
from thence he wrote a letter to the States Ge|neral,
giving them to under&s;tand, that he had the Queen's
orders to march to the relief of the empire; and expre&s;&s;ing
his hope that they would approve the de&s;ign, and allow
their troops to &s;hare the honour of the expedition. By the
return of a courier he received their approbation, and full
power to command their forces. He then proceed to
Mildenheim, where he was vi&s;ited by Prince Eugene; and
the&s;e two great men, who&s;e talents were cogenial, imme|diately
contracted an intimacy of friend&s;hip. Next day
Prince Louis of Baden arrived in the camp at Great Hip|pach.
He told the Duke, his grace was come to &s;ave the
empire, and to give him an opportunity of vindicating his
honour, which he knew was at the la&s;t &s;take in the opi|nion
of &s;ome people. The Duke replied, he was come to
learn of him how to &s;erve the empire: that they mu&s;t be
ignorant indeed, who did not know that the Prince of
<PB N="20" REF="22">
Baden, when his health permitted him, and pre&s;erved the
empire, and extended its conque&s;ts.</P>
<P>&sect; XV. Tho&s;e three celebrated generals agreed that the
two armies &s;hould join: that the command &s;hould be al|ternately
ve&s;ted in the Duke and Prince Louis, from day
to day; and that Prince Eugene &s;hould command a &s;epa|rate
army on the Rhine. Prince Louis returned to his
army on the Danube; Prince Eugene &s;et out for Philip&s;|burg;
the Duke of Marlborough being joined by the Im|perial
army under Prince Louis of Baden, at We&s;tertellen,
pro&s;ecuted his march by Elchingen, Gingen, and Land|thau&s;&s;en.
On the fir&s;t day of July he was in &s;ight of the
enemy's entrenchments at Dillingen, and encamped with
his right at Amerdighem, and his left at Onderingen.
Under&s;tanding that the Elector of Bavaria had detached
the be&s;t part of his infantry to re-enforce the Count
D'Arco, who was po&s;ted behind &s;trong lines at Schellen|berg
near Donawert, he re&s;olved to attack their entrench|ments
without delay. On the &s;econd day of July he ad|vanced
towards the enemy, and pa&s;&s;ed the river Wermitz;
about five o'clock in the afternoon the attack was begun
by the Engli&s;h and Dutch infantry, &s;upported by the hor&s;e
and dragoons. They were very &s;everely handled, and even
obliged to give way, when Prince Louis of Baden march|ing
up, at the head of the Imperiali&s;ts, to another part of
the line, made a diver&s;ion in their favour. After an ob&s;ti|nate
re&s;i&s;tance they forced the entrenchments, and the
hor&s;e entering with the infantry, fell &s;o furiou&s;ly upon the
enemy, already di&s;ordered, that they were routed with
great &s;laughter. They fled with the utmo&s;t trepidation to
Donawert on the Danube, leaving &s;ix thou&s;and men
dead on the field of battle. The confederates took &s;ixteen
pieces of cannon, thirteen pair of colours, with all the
tents and baggage. Yet the victory was dearly purcha&s;ed;
&s;ome thou&s;ands of the allies were &s;lain in the attack, in|cluding
many gallant officers, among whom were the
Generals Goor and Beinheim, and Count Stirum was
mortally wounded. Next day the Bavarian garri&s;on aban|doned
<PB N="21" REF="23">
Donawert, of which the confederates took imme|diate
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, while the Elector pa&s;&s;ed the Danube in
his march to the river Leche, le&s;t the victors &s;hould cut off
his retreat to his own country. The confederates having
cro&s;&s;ed the Danube on &s;everal bridges of pontoons, a de|tachment
was &s;ent to pa&s;s the Leche, and take po&s;t in the
country of the Elector, who had retired under the cannon
of Aug&s;burg. The garri&s;on of Neuburg retiring to Ingol|&s;tadt,
the place was &s;ecured by the confederates; and the
Count de Frize was detached with nine battalions and
fifteen &s;quadrons to inve&s;t the town of Rain. Advice ar|riving
from Prince Eugene, that the Mare&s;chals Villeroy
and Tallard had pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine at Fort Kehl, with an
army of five-and-forty thou&s;and men, to &s;uccour the
Elector of Bavaria, the generals of the allies immediately
detached Prince Maximilian of Hanover, with thirty
&s;quadrons of hor&s;e, as a re-enforcement to the Prince. In
a few days Rain &s;urrendered, and Aicha was taken by
a&s;&s;ault. The Emperor no &s;ooner received a confirmation
of the victory of Schellenberg, than he wrote a letter of
acknowledgement to the Duke of Marlborough, and or|dered
Count Wrati&s;lau to intimate his intention of inve&s;t|ing
him with the title of prince of the empire, which the
Duke declined accepting, until the Queen interpo&s;ed her
authority at the de&s;ire of Leopold.</P>
<P>&sect; XVI. The allies advanced within a league of Aug&s;|burg,
and though they &s;ound the Elector of Bavaria too
&s;ecurely po&s;ted under the cannon of that city, to be di&s;|lodged
or attacked with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, they en|camped
with Friedburg in their centre, &s;o as to cut off all
communication between him and his dominions. The
Duke of Marlborough having reduced him to this &s;itua|tion,
propo&s;ed very advantageous terms of peace, provided
he would abandon the French intere&s;t, and join the Im|periali&s;ts
in Italy. His &s;ubjects &s;eeing them&s;elves at the
mercy of the allies, pre&s;&s;ed him to comply with the&s;e
offers, rather than expo&s;e his country to ruin and de&s;ola|tion.
A negociation was begun, and he &s;eemed ready to
<PB N="22" REF="24">
&s;ign the articles, when hearing that Mare&s;chal Tallard
had pa&s;&s;ed the Black-fore&s;t, to join him with a great body
of forces, he declared, that &s;ince the King of France had
made &s;uch powerful efforts to &s;upport him, he thought
him&s;elf obliged in honour to continue firm in his alliance.
The generals of the allies were &s;o exa&s;perated at this di&s;|appointment,
that they &s;ent out detachments to ravage
the country of Bavaria, as far as Munich: upwards of
three hundred towns, villages, and ca&s;tles were inhu|manly
de&s;troyed, to the indelible di&s;grace of tho&s;e who
countenanced and conducted &s;uch barbarous practices.
The Elector, &s;hocked at the&s;e brutal proceedings, de&s;ired,
in a letter to the Duke of Marlborough, that a &s;top
might be put to acts of violence &s;o oppo&s;ite to true glory.
The an&s;wer he received implied, that it was in his own
power to put an end to them by a &s;peedy accommodation.
Incen&s;ed at this reply, he declared, that &s;ince they had
obliged him to draw the &s;word, he would throw away the
&s;cabbard. The Duke and Prince Louis, finding it im|practicable
to attack the Elector in his &s;trong camp, re|&s;olved
to undertake the &s;iege of Ingold&s;tadt, and for that
purpo&s;e pa&s;&s;ed the Paer near the town of Schrobbenhau&s;en,
where they encamped, with their left at Clo&s;terberg. On
the fifth day of Augu&s;t the Elector of Bavaria marched to
Biberach, where he was joined by Tallard. He re&s;olved
to pa&s;s the Danube at Lawingen, to attack Prince Eugene,
who had followed the French army from the lines of
Biehl, and lay encamped at Hoch&s;tadt. Next day, how|ever,
he made a motion that di&s;appointed the enemy.
Neverthele&s;s, they per&s;i&s;ted in their de&s;ign of pa&s;&s;ing the
Danube, and encamping at Bl$nheim. The allies re|&s;olved
that Prince Louis &s;hould undertake the &s;iege of
Ingold&s;tadt, whil&s;t Prince Eugen$ and the Duke &s;hould
ob&s;erve the Elector of Bavaria. Advice being received
that he had actually cro&s;&s;ed the Danube at Lawingen, the
Duke of Marlborough joined the forces of Prince Eugene
at the camp of Mun&s;ter on the eleventh day of Augu&s;t,
Prince Louis having by this time marched off towards the
<PB N="23" REF="25">
place he intended to be&s;iege. Next day the Duke of
Marlborough and Prince Eugene ob&s;erved the po&s;ture of
the enemy, who were advantageou&s;ly po&s;ted on a hill near
Hoch&s;tadt, their right being covered by the Danube and
the village of Blenheim, their left by the village of Lut|zengen,
and their front by a rivulet, the banks of which
were &s;teep, and the bottom mar&s;hy.</P>
<P>&sect; XVII. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e difficulties, the generals
re&s;olved to attack them immediately, rather than lie in|active
until their forage and provi&s;ion &s;hould be con&s;umed.
They were moreover &s;timulated to this hazardous enter|pri&s;e,
by an intercepted letter to the Elector of Bavaria
from Mare&s;chal Villeroy, giving him to under&s;tand, that
he had received orders to ravage the county of Wirtem|berg,
and intercept all communication between the Rhine
and the allied army. The di&s;po&s;itions being made for the
attack, and the orders communicated to the general
officers, the forces advanced into the plain on the thir|teenth
day of Augu&s;t, and were ranged in order of battle.
The cannonading began about nine in the morning and
continued on both &s;ides till one in the afternoon. The
French and Bavarians amounted to about &s;ixty thou&s;and
men. Mare&s;chal Tallard commanded on the right, and
po&s;ted &s;even-and-twenty battalions, with twelve &s;quadrons,
in the village of Blenheim, &s;uppo&s;ing that there the allies
would make their chief effort: their left was conducted by
the Elector of Bavaria, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Mar&s;in, a French ge|neral
of experience and capacity. The number of the
confederates did not exceed five-and-fifty: their right was
under the direction of Prince Eugene, and their left com|manded
by the Duke of Marlborough. At noon the
action was begun by a body of Engli&s;h and He&s;&s;ians,
under Major-General Wilkes, who having pa&s;&s;ed the
rivulet with difficulty, and filed off to the left in the face
of the enemy, attacked the village of Blenheim with great
vigour; but were repul&s;ed after three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive attempts.
Mean while the troops in the centre, and part of the right
wing, pa&s;&s;ed the rivulet on planks in different places;
<PB N="24" REF="26">
and formed on the other &s;ide without any mole&s;tation from
the enemy. At length, however, they were charged by
the French hor&s;e with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, and &s;o terribly
galled in flank by the troops po&s;ted at Blenheim, that they
fell in di&s;order, and part of them repa&s;&s;ed the rivulet: but
a re-enforcement of dragoons coming up, the French ca|valry
were broke in their turn, and driven to the very
hedges of the village of Blenheim. The left wing of the
confederates being now completely formed, a&s;cended the
hill in a firm compacted body, charging the enemy's
hor&s;e, which could no longer &s;tand their ground, but ral|lied
&s;everal times as they gave way. Tallard, in order to
make a vigorous effort, ordered ten battalions to fill up
the intervals of his cavalry. The Duke, perceiving his de|&s;ign,
&s;ent three battalions of the troops of Zell to &s;u&s;tain
his hor&s;e. Neverthele&s;s, the line was a little di&s;ordered by
the prodigious fire from the French infantry, and even ob|liged
to recoil about &s;ixty paces: but the confederates
advancing to the charge with redoubled ardour, routed
the French hor&s;e; and their battalions being thus aban|doned,
were cut in pieces. Tallard, having rallied his
broken cavalry behind &s;ome tents that were &s;till &s;tanding,
re&s;olved to draw off the troops he had po&s;ted in the village
of Blenheim, and &s;ent an aide-du-camp to Mar&s;in, who
was with the Elector of Bavaria on the left, to de&s;ire he
would face the confederates with &s;ome troops to the right
of the village of Oberklau, &s;o as to keep them in play,
and favour the retreat of the forces from Blenheim. That
officer a&s;&s;ured him, he was &s;o far from being in a condi|tion
to &s;pare troops, that he could hardly maintain his
ground. The fate of the day was now more than half
decided. The French cavalry being vigorou&s;ly attacked in
flank were totally defeated. Part of them endeavoured to
gain the bridge which they had thrown over the Danube
between Hoch&s;tadt and Blenheim; but they were &s;o clo&s;ely
pur&s;ued, that tho&s;e who e&s;caped the &s;laughter threw them|&s;elves
into the river, where they peri&s;hed. Tallard, being
&s;urrounded, was taken near a mill behind the village of
<PB N="25" REF="27">
Sonderen, together with the Marquis de Montperouz,
general of hor&s;e, the Major-Generals de Seppeville,
de Silly, de la Valiere, and many other officers of di&s;tinc|tion.
Whil&s;t the&s;e occurrences pa&s;&s;ed on the left wing,
Mar&s;in's quarters at the village of Oberklau, in the centre,
were attacked by ten battalions, under the Prince of Hol|&s;tein-beck,
who pa&s;&s;ed the rivulet with undaunted re&s;olu|tion:
but before he could form his men on the other
&s;ide, he was overpowered by numbers, mortally wounded,
and taken pri&s;oner. His battalions being &s;upported by
&s;ome Dani&s;h and Hanoverian cavalry, renewed the charge,
and were again repul&s;ed: at length, the Duke of Marl|borough
in per&s;on brought up &s;ome fre&s;h &s;quadrons from
the body of re&s;erve, and compelled the enemy to retire.
By this time Prince Eugene had obliged the left wing of
the enemy to give ground, after having &s;urmounted a great
number of difficulties, &s;u&s;tained a very ob&s;tinate oppo&s;i|tion,
and &s;een his cavalry, in which his chief &s;trength
&s;eemed to lie, three times repul&s;ed. The Duke of Marl|borough
had no &s;ooner defeated the right wing, than he
made a di&s;po&s;ition to re-enforce the Prince, when he un|der&s;tood
from an aide-du-camp, that his highne&s;s had no
occa&s;ion for a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and that the Elector, with Mon|&s;ieur
de Mar&s;in had abandoned Oberklau and Lutzingen.
They were pur&s;ued as far as the villages of Mor&s;elingen
and Tei&s;&s;enhoven, from whence they retreated to Dillingen
and Lawingen. The confederates being now ma&s;ters of
the filed of battle, &s;urrounded the village of Blenheim, in
which, as we have already ob&s;erved, &s;even-and-twenty
battalions and twelve &s;quadrons were po&s;ted. The&s;e
troops, &s;eeing them&s;elves cut off from all communication
with the re&s;t of their army, and de&s;pairing of being able
to force their way through the allies, capitulated about
eight in the evening, laid down their arms, delivered
their colours and &s;tandards, and &s;urrendered them&s;elves
pri&s;oners of war, on condition that the officers &s;hould
not be rifled. This was one of the mo&s;t glorious and
complete victories that ever was obtained. Ten thou|&s;and
<PB N="26" REF="28">
French and Bavarians were left dead on the field of
battle: the greater part of thirty &s;quarons of hor&s;e and
dragoons peri&s;hed in the river Danube: thirteen thou&s;and
were made pri&s;oners: one hundred pieces of cannon were
taken, with twenty-four mortars, one hundred and twenty-nine
colours, one hundred and &s;eventy-one &s;tandards,
&s;eventeen pair of kettle-drums, three thou&s;and &s;ix hundred
tents, four-and-thirty coaches, three hundred laden mules,
two bridges of boats, fifteen pontoons, fifteen barrels and
eight ca&s;ks filled with &s;ilver. Of the allies, about four
thou&s;and five hundred men were killed, and about eight
thou&s;and wounded or taken. The lo&s;s of the battle was
imputed to two capital errors committed by Mare&s;chal
Tallard; namely, his weakening the centre, by detaching
&s;uch a number of troops to the village of Blenheim, and
his &s;uffering the confederates to pa&s;s the rivulet, and form
unmole&s;ted. Certain it is, the&s;e circum&s;tances contri|buted
to the &s;ucce&s;s of the Duke of Marlborough, who
rode through the hotte&s;t of the fire with the calme&s;t intre|pidity,
giving his orders with that pre&s;ence of mind and
deliberation which were &s;o peculiar to his character. When
he next day vi&s;ited Tallard, he told that general, he was
&s;orry &s;uch a misfortune &s;hould happen per&s;onally to one
for whom he had a profound e&s;teem. The Mare&s;chal con|gratulated
him on having vanqui&s;hed the be&s;t troops in the
world; a compliment to which the Duke replied, That
he thought his own the be&s;t troops in the world, &s;eeing they
had conquered tho&s;e upon whom the Mare&s;chal had be|&s;towed
&s;uch an encomium.</P>
<P>&sect; XVIII. The victorious generals having by this deci&s;ive
&s;troke &s;aved the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria from entire ruin, and
entirely changed the face of affairs in the empire, &s;ignified
their opinion to Prince Louis of Baden, that it would be
for the advantage of the common cau&s;e to join all their
forces, and drive the French out of Germany, rather than
lo&s;e time at the &s;iege of Ingold&s;tadt, which would &s;urrender
of cour&s;e. This opinion was confirmed by the conduct of
the French garri&s;on at Aug&s;burg, who quitted that place
<PB N="27" REF="29">
on the &s;ixteenth day of Augu&s;t. The magi&s;trates &s;ent a
deputation, craving the protection of the Duke of Marl|borough,
who forthwith ordered a detachment to take
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that important city. The Duke having &s;ent
Mare&s;chal de Tallard under a guard of dragoons to Frank|fort,
and di&s;po&s;ed of the other pri&s;oners of di&s;tinction in
the adjacent places, encamped at Se&s;illingen, within half
a league of Ulm. Here he held a conference with the
Princes Eugene and Louis of Baden, in which they
agreed that, as the enemy retreated towards the Rhine,
the confederate army &s;hould take the &s;ame route, excepting
three-and-twenty battalions and &s;ome &s;quadrons, to be left
for the &s;iege of Ulm, under General Thungen. They
began their march on the twenty-&s;ixth day of Augu&s;t, by
different routes, to the general rendezvous at Bru&s;chai,
near Philip&s;burg. Then they re&s;olved, that Prince Louis
of Baden &s;hould undertake the &s;iege of Landau, in order
to &s;ecure the circle of Suabia from the incur&s;ions of that
garri&s;on. Con&s;idering the con&s;ternation that prevailed all
over France, nothing could be more impolitick than this
mea&s;ure, which gave the enemy time for recollection, and
recruiting their forces. It was a propo&s;al on which the
Prince of Baden in&s;i&s;ted with uncommon ob&s;tinacy. He
was even &s;u&s;pected of corruption. He was jealous of the
glory which the Duke of Marlborough had acquired, and
&s;uch a bigoted papi&s;t, that he repined at the &s;ucce&s;s of an
heretical general. On the twelfth day of September he
marched towards Landau with the troops de&s;tined for the
&s;iege, and the Duke of Marlborough, with Prince Eugene,
encamped at Croon Wei&s;&s;enburg, to cover the enterpri&s;e.
By this time Ulm had &s;urrendered to Thungen, even be|fore
the trenches were opened. Villeroy advanced with
his army towards Landau, as if he had intended to attack
the confederates: but he retired without having made any
attempt for the relief of the place, which was de&s;ended
with the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate valour till the twenty-third day of
November, when the be&s;iegers having lodged them&s;elves
on the counter&s;carps, the breaches being practicable, and
<PB N="28" REF="30">
the di&s;po&s;itions made for a general a&s;&s;ault, the garri&s;on
capitulated upon honourable conditions. The King of the
Romans had arrived in the camp, that he might have the
credit of taking the place, the command of which he be|&s;towed
on the Count de Frize, who had before defended it
with equal courage and ability.</P>
<P>&sect; XIX. The next enterpri&s;e which the confederates
undertook, was the &s;iege of Traerbach. The Hereditary
Prince of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el being entru&s;ted with the direction
of the attacks, inve&s;ted the ca&s;tle in the beginning of No|vember.
Though it was &s;trongly fortified, and well de|fended,
he carried on his operations with &s;uch &s;pirit and
a&s;&s;iduity, that in about &s;ix weeks the garri&s;on &s;urrendered
the place on honourable terms. In the mean time the
Duke of Marlborough repaired to Berlin, where he ne|gociated
for a re-enforcement of eight thou&s;and Pru&s;&s;ians,
to &s;erve under Prince Eugene in Italy during the next
campaign. Thence he proceeded to the court of Hanover,
where, as in all other places, he was received with parti|cular
marks of di&s;tinction. When he arrived at the Hague,
he was congratulated by the States-General on his victories
at Schellenberg and Blenheim, and as much con&s;idered
in Holland as if he had been actually &s;tadtholder. He had
received a &s;econd letter from the Emperor, couched in the
warme&s;t terms of acknowledgement, and was declared
prince of the empire. In December he embarked for
England, where he found the people in a tran&s;port of joy,
and was welcomed as a hero who had retrieved the glory of
the nation.</P>
<P>&sect; XX. In Flanders, nothing of moment was executed,
except the bombardment of Bruges and Namur by Baron
Spaar, with nine thou&s;and Dutch troops; and two at|tempts
upon the French lines, which were actually pene|trated
by Auverquerque, though he was not able to main|tain
the footing he had gained. The Elector of Bavaria,
who had retired to Bru&s;&s;els after his defeat, formed a
&s;cheme for &s;urpri&s;ing the Dutch general at the end of the
campaign, and a&s;&s;embled all his troops at Tirlemont: but
<PB N="29" REF="31">
the French court, apprehen&s;ive of his temerity, &s;ent
Villeroy to watch his conduct, and prevent his hazarding
an engagement, except with a fair pro&s;pect of advantage.
The Mare&s;chal, finding him determined to give battle at
all events, repre&s;ented the improbability of &s;ucceeding
again&s;t an enemy &s;o advantageou&s;ly po&s;ted; and the ill
con&s;equences of a repul&s;e: but, finding the Elector deaf
to all his remon&s;trances, he flatly refu&s;ed to march, and
produced the King's order to avoid an engagement. In
Italy the French met with no oppo&s;ition. The Duke of
Savoy, being unable to face the enemy in the field, was
obliged to lie inactive. He &s;aw the Duke de Vendome
reduce Vercelli and Ivrea, and undertake the &s;iege of
Verac; while he po&s;ted his little army on the other &s;ide of
the Po, at Cre&s;centino, where he had a bridge of commu|nication,
by which he &s;upplied the place occa&s;ionally with
fre&s;h troops and provi&s;ion. The place held out five
months, again&s;t all the efforts of the French general: at
length, the communication being cut off, the Duke of
Savoy retired to Chivas. He bore his misfortunes with
great equanimity; and told the Engli&s;h mini&s;ter, that
though he was abandoned by the allies, he would never
abandon him&s;elf. The Emperor had neglected Italy, that
he might act with more vigour again&s;t Ragot&s;ki and the
Hungarian malcontents, over whom he obtained &s;everal
advantages; notwith&s;tanding which they continued for|midable,
from their number, bravery, and re&s;olution.
The mini&s;ters of the allies pre&s;&s;ed Leopold to enter into a
negociation for a peace with tho&s;e rebels; and conferences
were opened; but he was not &s;incerely di&s;po&s;ed to an ac|commodation,
and Ragot&s;ki aimed at the principality of
Tran&s;ylvania, which the court of Vienna would not ea&s;ily
relinqui&s;h. The Emperor was not a little alarmed by a
revolution at the Ortoman Porte, until the new &s;ultan
di&s;patched a chiaus to Vienna, with an a&s;&s;urance that he
would give no a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the malcontents of Hungary.
In Poland, the diet being a&s;&s;embled by the Cardinal-Pri|mate,
Stani&s;laus Lezin&s;ki, Palatine of Po&s;nania, was
<PB N="30" REF="32">
elected and proclaimed king, and recognized by Charles of
Sweden, who &s;till maintained his army by contributions
in that country, more intent upon the ruin of Augu&s;tus
than upon the pre&s;ervation of his own dominions; for he
paid no regard to the progre&s;s of the Mu&s;covites, who had
ravaged Livonia, reduced Narva, and made incur&s;ions
into Sweden. Augu&s;tus retreated into his Saxon domi|nions,
which he impoveri&s;hed, in order to rai&s;e a great
army, with which he might return to Poland: the Pope
e&s;pou&s;ed the intere&s;t of this new convert, &s;o far as to cite
the Cardinal-Primate to appear at Rome, and give an ac|count
of the &s;hare he had in the Poli&s;h troubles. The
prote&s;tants of the Cevennois, deriving courage from de&s;pair,
became &s;o trouble&s;ome to the government of France, that
Louis was obliged to treat them with lenity; he &s;ent
Mare&s;chal Villars again&s;t them with a fre&s;h re-enforcement;
but at the &s;ame time furni&s;hed him with in&s;tructions to treat
for an accommodation. This officer immediately com|menced
a negociation with Cavalier, the chief of the re|volters;
and a formal treaty was concluded, by which they
were indulged with liberty of con&s;cience; but the&s;e arti|cles
were very ill ob&s;erved by the French mini&s;try.</P>
<P>&sect; XXI. In Portugal, the intere&s;t of King Charles wore
a very melancholy a&s;pect. When he arrived at Li&s;bon,
he found no preparations made for opening the campaign.
The Portugue&s;e mini&s;try favoured the French in &s;ecret;
the people were aver&s;e to heretics; the Duke of Schom|berg
was on ill terms with Fagel, the Dutch general; the
Portugue&s;e forces con&s;i&s;ted of raw undi&s;ciplined pea&s;ants;
and the French amba&s;&s;adour had bought up the be&s;t hor&s;es
in the kingdom; &s;o that the troopers could not be properly
mounted. The King of Portugal had promi&s;ed to enter
Spain with Charles by the middle of May; but he was
not ready till the beginning of June, when they reached
Santaren. By this time they had publi&s;hed their re&s;pective
manife&s;toes; Charles di&s;playing his title to the crown of
Spain, and promi&s;ing pardon to all his &s;ubjects who &s;hould
in three months join his army; and the King of Portugal
<PB N="31" REF="33">
declaring, that his &s;ole aim in taking up arms was to re|&s;tore
the liberty of the Spani&s;h nation, oppre&s;&s;ed by the
power of France, as well as to a&s;&s;ert the right of Charles
to that monarchy. The pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, whom they
mentioned by the name of the Duke of Anjou, had already
anticipated their inva&s;ion. His general, the Duke of Ber|wick,
entering Portugal, took the town of Segura by
&s;tratagem. The governor of Salva-terra &s;urrendered at
di&s;cretion; Cebreros was reduced without much oppo&s;i|tion;
Zebredo was abandoned by the inhabitants; and
the town of Lhana la Viella was taken by a&s;&s;ault. Por|tugal
was at the &s;ame time invaded in different parts by the
Marquis de Jeoffreville, Prince T&s;erclaes de Tilly, and
the Marquis de Villadarias. Two Dutch battalions were
attacked and taken by the Duke of Berwick at Sodreira
Formo&s;a. Then he pa&s;&s;ed the Tagus, and joined Prince
T&s;erclaes. King Philip arriving in the army, inve&s;ted
Portalegre; and the garri&s;on, including an Engli&s;h regi|ment
of foot commanded by Colonel Stanhope, were made
pri&s;oners of war. The next place he be&s;ieged was Ca&s;tel
Davide, which met with the &s;ame fate. On the other
hand, the Marquis Das Minas, in order to make a diver|&s;ion,
entered Spain with fifteen thou&s;and men, took Fuente
Grimaldo, in Ca&s;tile, by a&s;&s;ault, defeated a body of French
and Spaniards commanded by Don Ronquillo, and made
him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Man&s;einto. The weather growing ex|ce&s;&s;ively
hot, Philip &s;ent his troops into quarters of re|fre&s;hment;
and the allies followed his example. Duke
Schomberg finding his advice very little regarded by the
Portugue&s;e mini&s;try, and &s;eeing very little pro&s;pect of &s;uc|ce&s;s,
de&s;ired leave to re&s;ign his command, which the
Queen be&s;towed upon the Earl of Galway, who, with a
re-enforcement of Engli&s;h and Dutch troops, arrived at
Li&s;bon on the thirteenth day of July. About the latter end
of September, the two Kings repaired to the camp near
Almeda, re&s;olving to invade Ca&s;tile; but they &s;ound the
river Agueda &s;o well guarded by the Duke of Berwick,
that they would not attempt a pa&s;&s;age. They, therefore,
<PB N="32" REF="34">
retired into the territories of Portugal, and the army was
put into winter-quarters. The Spaniards were now &s;o
weakened, by detachments &s;ent with the Marquis de Villa|darias
towards Gibraltar, that the Duke of Berwick could
not execute any &s;cheme of importance during the remain|ing
part of the campaign.</P>
<P>&sect; XXII. The arms of England were not le&s;s fortunate
by &s;ea than they had been upon the Danube. Sir George
Rooke having landed King Charles at Li&s;bon, &s;ent a
&s;quadron to crui&s;e off Cape Spartell, under the command
of Rear-Admiral Dilkes, who, on the twelfth of March,
engaged and took three Spani&s;h &s;hips of war, bound from
St. Seba&s;tian's to Cadiz. Rooke received orders from the
Queen to &s;ail to the relief of Nice and Villa Franca,
which were threatened with a &s;iege by the Duke de Ven|dome:
at the &s;ame time he was pre&s;&s;ed by King Charles
to execute a &s;cheme upon Barcelona, projected by the
Prince of He&s;&s;e d'Arm&s;tadt, who declared his opinion,
that the Catalonians would declare for the hou&s;e of
Au&s;tria, as &s;oon as they &s;hould be a&s;&s;ured of proper &s;up|port
and protection. The mini&s;try of England under|&s;tanding
that the French were employed in equipping a
&s;trong &s;quadron at Bre&s;t, and judging it was de&s;tined to
act in the Mediterranean, &s;ent out Sir Cloude&s;ley Shovel
with a con&s;iderable fleet, to watch the motions of the
Bre&s;t &s;quadron; and he was provided with in&s;tructions
how to act, in ca&s;e it &s;hould be &s;ailed to the Mediterra|nean.
Mean while, Sir George Rooke, in compliance
with the entreaties of King Charles, &s;ailed with the
tran&s;ports under his convoy to Barcelona, and on the
eighteenth of May appeared before the city. Next day,
the troops were landed by the Prince of He&s;&s;e, to the
number of two thou&s;and, and the Dutch ketches bom|barded
the place; but by this time the governor had
&s;ecured the chiefs of the Au&s;trian party; and the people
exhibiting no marks of attachment to King Charles, the
Prince re-embarked his &s;oldiers, from an apprehen&s;ion of
their being attacked and overpowered by &s;uperior numbers.
<PB N="33" REF="35">
On the &s;ixteenth day of June Sir George Rooke, being
joined by Sir Cloude&s;ley Shovel, re&s;olved to proceed up
the Mediterranean in que&s;t of the French fleet, which had
&s;ailed thither from Bre&s;t, and which Rooke had actually
di&s;covered, in the preceding month, on their voyage to
Toulon. On the &s;eventeenth day of July the Admiral
called a council of war in the road of Tetuan, when they
re&s;olved to make an attempt upon Gibraltar, which was
but &s;lenderly provided with a garri&s;on. Thither they &s;ail|ed,
and on the twenty-fir&s;t day of the month the Prince
of He&s;&s;e landed on the i&s;thmus with eighteen hundred
marines; then he &s;ummoned the governor to &s;urrender,
and was an&s;wered, that the place would be defended to
the la&s;t extremity. Next day the Admiral gave orders for
cannonading the town: perceiving that the enemy were
driven from their fortifications at the &s;outh mole-head, he
commanded Captain Whitaker to arm all the boats, and
a&s;&s;ault that quarter. The Captains Hicks and Jumper,
who happened to be neare&s;t the mole, immediately manned
their pinnaces, and entered the fortifications &s;word in hand.
The Spaniards &s;prung a mine, by which two lieutenants,
and about a hundred men, were killed or wounded. Ne|verthele&s;s,
the two Captains took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a platform,
and kept their ground until they were &s;u&s;tained by Captain
Whitaker, and the re&s;t of the &s;eamen, who took by &s;torm
a redoubt between the mole and the town. Then the
governour capitulated; and the Prince of He&s;&s;e entered
the place, amazed at the &s;ucce&s;s of this attempts, con&s;ider|ing
the &s;trength of the fortifications, which might have
been defended by fifty men again&s;t a numerous army.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIII. A &s;ufficient garri&s;on being left with his
Highne&s;s, the Admiral returned to Tetuan, to take in
wood and water; and when he $ailed, on the ninth day
of Augu&s;t, he de&s;eried the French &s;leet, to which he gave
cha&s;e with all the &s;ail he could &s;pread. On the thirteenth
he came up with it, as it lay in a line off Malaga ready
to receive him, to the number of two-and-fifty great &s;hips,
and four-and-twenty galleys, under the command of the
<PB N="34" REF="36">
Count de Tholou&s;e, high-admiral of France, with the
inferior flags of the white and blue divi&s;ions. The Engli&s;h
fleet con&s;i&s;ted of three-and-fifty &s;hips of the line, exclu&s;ive
of frigates; but they were inferior to the French in number
of guns and men, as well as in weight of metal, and alto|gether
unprovided of gallies, from which the enemy
reaped great advantage during the engagement. A little
after ten in the morning the battle began, with equal fury
on both &s;ides, and continued to rage with doubtful &s;uc|ce&s;s
till two in the afternoon, when the van of the French
gave way; neverthele&s;s, the fight was maintained till
night, when the enemy bore away to leeward. The wind
&s;hifting before morning the French gained the weather|gage;
but they made no u&s;e of this advantage: for two
&s;ucce&s;&s;ive days the Engli&s;h admiral endeavoured to renew
the engagement, which the Count de Tholou&s;e declined,
and at la&s;t he di&s;appeared. The lo&s;s was pretty equal on
both &s;ides, though not a &s;ingle &s;hip was taken or de&s;troyed
by either; but the honour of the day certainly remained
with the Engli&s;h. Over and above the di&s;advantages we
have enumerated, the bottoms of the Briti&s;h fleet were
foul, and &s;everal large &s;hips had expended all their &s;hot
long before the battle cea&s;ed: yet the enemy were &s;o
roughly handled, that they did not venture another en|gagement
during the whole war. The French King, in
order to rai&s;e the drooping &s;pirits of his people, claimed
the victory, and publi&s;hed an account of the action, which,
at this di&s;tance of time, plainly proves that he was reduced
to the mean &s;hift of impo&s;ing upon his &s;ubjects, by fal&s;e
and partial repre&s;entations. Among other exaggerations
in this detail, we find mention made of mi&s;chief done to
French &s;hips by Engli&s;h bombs; though nothing is more
certain than that there was not one bomb-ve&s;&s;el in the
combined fleet. The French academy, actuated by a
&s;ervile &s;pirit of adulation, cau&s;ed a medal to be &s;truck on
the occa&s;ion, which, in&s;tead of perpetuating the glory of
their prince, &s;erves only to tran&s;mit their own &s;hame to
po&s;terity. After the battle, Sir George Rooke &s;ailed to
<PB N="35" REF="37">
Gibraltar to re&s;it, and leaving a &s;quadron with Sir John
Leake, &s;et &s;ail for England on the twenty-fourth day of
Augu&s;t. He arrived in September, and was received by
the mini&s;try, and the people in general, with tho&s;e marks
of e&s;teem and veneration which were due to his long &s;er|vices
and &s;ignal &s;ucce&s;s; but he was &s;till per&s;ecuted with
a &s;pirit of envy and detraction. Philip King of Spain,
alarmed at the reduction of Gibraltar, &s;ent the Marquis
de Villadarias with an army to retake it. The &s;iege la&s;ted
four-months, during which the Prince of He&s;&s;e exhibited
many &s;hining proofs of courage and ability. The place
was &s;upplied with men and provi&s;ions by convoys from
Li&s;bon, until Mon&s;ieur de Pointis put a &s;top to that com|munication,
by entering the bay with a &s;trong &s;quadron:
but he was obliged to retire at the approach of Sir John
Leake and Admiral Vanderdu&s;&s;en; and the Marquis de
Villadarias having made little or no progre&s;s on land,
thought proper to abandon the enterpri&s;e.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIV. The parliament of England meeting on the
twenty-ninth day of October, the Queen, in her &s;peech,
ob&s;erved that the great and remarkable &s;ucce&s;s with
which God had ble&s;&s;ed her arms produced unanimous
joy and &s;atisfaction through all parts of the kingdom; and
that a timely improvement of the pre&s;ent advantages
would enable her to procure a la&s;ting foundation of &s;ecu|rity
for England, as well as a firm &s;upport for the liberty
of Europe. She declared her intention was to be kind
and indulgent to all her &s;ubjects. She expre&s;&s;ed her hope
that they would do nothing to endanger the lo&s;s of this
opportunity; and that there would be no contention among
them, but an emulation to promote the publick welfare.
Congratulatory addre&s;&s;es were voted and pre&s;ented by both
Hou&s;es. They were equal in their profe&s;&s;ions of duty and
affection to the Queen; but the addre&s;&s;es imbibed a very
different colour from the different factions by which the
two Hou&s;es were influenced. The Lords congratulated
her on the great and glorious &s;ucce&s;s of her arms under
the command of the Duke of Marlborough, without
<PB N="36" REF="38">
deigning to mention Sir George Rooke, who had defeated
the French navy at &s;ea, and added the important fortre&s;s
of Gibraltar to the Briti&s;h conque&s;ts. On the other hand,
the Commons affected to mention the battle of Blenheim,
and Rooke's naval victory, as events of equal glory and
importance. However they might be warped by prejudice
again&s;t individuals, they did not &s;uffer the war to langui&s;h
for want of &s;upplies. Having taken into con&s;ideration the
&s;ervices of the army and navy, they voted that the Queen
&s;hould be de&s;ired to be&s;tow her bounty on the &s;eamen and
land-forces who had behaved them&s;elves &s;o gallantly.
Then they deliberated upon the different articles of na|tional
expen&s;e, and granted four millions &s;ix hundred and
&s;eventy thou&s;and, nine hundred, and thirty-one pounds,
for the occa&s;ions of the en&s;uing year, to be rai&s;ed by a
land-tax, by the &s;ale of annuities, and other expedients.
The&s;e mea&s;ures were taken with &s;uch expedition, that the
land-tax received the royal a&s;&s;ent on the ninth day of De|cember;
when the Queen, in a &s;hort &s;peech, thanked the
Commons for their di&s;patch, which &s;he con&s;idered as a
&s;ure pledge of their affection.</P>
<P>&sect; XXV. The high-church party took this occa&s;ion to
promote the bill again&s;t occa&s;ional conformity, which was
revived and brought into the Hou&s;e on a new model, by
Mr. William Bromley, who moved that it might be
tacked to the land-tax bill, and &s;ent up to the Lords for
their concurrence. The court no longer e&s;pou&s;ed this
mea&s;ure; and the violent party was weakened by defec|tion.
After a warm and tedious debate, the tack was
rejected by a great majority. The bill, however, pa&s;&s;ed
the Hou&s;e of Commons, and was &s;ent up to the Lords on
the fourteenth day of December, when it would hardly
have excited a debate, had not the Queen been pre&s;ent
and de&s;irous of hearing what could be &s;aid on both &s;ides of
the que&s;tion. For the information and &s;atisfaction of her
Maje&s;ty the &s;ubject was again di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and all the argu|ments
being repeated, the bill was rejected by a majority
of one-and-twenty voices. The next &s;ubject on which the
<PB N="37" REF="39">
Hou&s;e of Lords employed their attention, was the late
conduct of the Scotti&s;h parliament. The Lord Haver&s;ham,
in a &s;et &s;peech, ob&s;erved, that the &s;ettlement of the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
in Scotland had been po&s;tponed, partly becau&s;e the
mini&s;try for that kingdom were weak and divided; partly
from a received opinion that the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was never &s;in|cerely
and cordially intended by tho&s;e who managed the
affairs of Scotland in the cabinet-council. He expatiated
on the bad con&s;equences that might attend the act of &s;e|curity,
which he &s;tiled a bill of exclu&s;ion; and particu|larly
mentioned that clau&s;e by which the heritors and
boroughs were ordained to exerci&s;e their &s;en&s;ible men every
month. He &s;aid the nobility and gentry of Scotland were
as learned and brave as any nation in Europe, and gene|rally
di&s;contented: that the common people were very
numerous, very &s;tout, and very poor; and he a&s;ked who
was the man that could tell what &s;uch a multitude, &s;o
armed, and &s;o di&s;ciplined, might do under &s;uch leaders,
could opportunities &s;uit their intention? He recommended
the&s;e circum&s;tances to the con&s;ideration of the Hou&s;e, and
concluded with the&s;e words of Lord Bacon, &startq;Let men
beware how they neglect or &s;uffer matter of troubles to
be prepared: for no man can forbid the &s;parks that may
&s;et all on fire.&endq; The Lords re&s;olved to con&s;ider the&s;e
&s;ubjects on the twenty-ninth day of November, when the
Queen repaired to the Hou&s;e of Peers to hear the debates,
and by her pre&s;ence moderate the heat of both parties.
The Earl of Nottingham reflected &s;o &s;everely on the me|mory
of King William, that he would have been &s;ent to
the Tower, had not the Lords declined any &s;uch motion
out of re&s;pect to her Maje&s;ty. After much declamation on
the Scotti&s;h act of &s;ecurity, the grand committee of the
Peers, by the advice of Lord Wharton, re&s;olved, That
the Queen &s;hould be enabled, by act of parliament on the
part of England, to name commi&s;&s;ioners to treat about an
union with Scotland, provided that the parliament of
Scotland &s;hould fir&s;t appoint commi&s;&s;ioners on the two
for the &s;ame purpo&s;e: That no Scot&s;men &s;hould$ed. A $word$

privileges of Engli&s;hmen, except &s;uch as were &s;ettled in
England, Ireland, and the plantations, and &s;uch as were
or might be in the &s;ea or land-&s;ervice, until an union
could be effected, or the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion &s;ettled as in England:
That the traffick by cattle from Scotland to England
&s;hould be prevented: That the Lord-Admiral &s;hould i&s;&s;ue
orders for taking &s;uch ve&s;&s;els as &s;hould be found trading
from Scotland to France, or to the ports of any of her
Maje&s;ty's enemies; and that care &s;hould be taken to pre|vent
the exportation of Engli&s;h wool into Scotland. On
the&s;e re&s;olutions a bill was formed for an entire union,
and pa&s;&s;ed the Hou&s;e on the twentieth day of December.
The Lords pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the Queen, repre&s;ent|ing
that they had duly weighed the dangerous and perni|cious
effects that were likely to be produced by divers acts
of parliament lately pa&s;&s;ed in Scotland: That they were
of opinion the &s;afety of the kingdom required that &s;peedy
and effectual orders &s;hould be given to put Newca&s;tle in
a po&s;ture of defence, to &s;ecure the port of Tinmouth, and
repair the fortifications of Hull and Carli&s;le. They like|wi&s;e
advi&s;ed her Maje&s;ty to give directions for di&s;ciplining
the militia of the four northern counteis; for providing
them with arms and ammunition; for maintaining a com|petent
number of regular troops on the northern borders
of England, as well as in the north of Ireland; and for
putting the laws in execution again&s;t papi&s;ts. The Queen
promi&s;ed that a &s;urvey &s;hold be made of the places they
had mentioned, and laid before the parliament; and that
&s;he would give the nece&s;&s;ary directions upon the other arti|cles
of the addre&s;s. The Commons &s;eemed to concur
with the Lords in their &s;entiments of the Scotti&s;h act of
&s;ecurity. They re&s;olved, That a bill &s;hould be brought
in for the effectual &s;ecuring the kingdom of England from
the apparent dangers that might ari&s;e from &s;everal acts
lately pa&s;&s;ed in the parliament of Scotland; and this was
$word$ on nearly the &s;ame re&s;olutions which had been
$span$ the Upper Hou&s;e. The bill &s;ent down by the
$span$ thrice read, and ordered to lie upon the table;
<PB N="39" REF="43">
but they pa&s;&s;ed their own, to take effect at Chri&s;tmas,
provided before that time the Scots &s;hould not &s;ettle the
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion. When it was offered to the Lords, they pa&s;&s;ed
it without any amendment, contrary to the expectation,
and even to the hope, of &s;ome members who were no
friends to the hou&s;e of Hanover, and firmly believed the
Lords would have treated this bill with the &s;ame contempt
which had been manife&s;ted for that which they had &s;ent
down to the Commons.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVI. The Duke of Marlborough, at his fir&s;t ap|pearance
in the Hou&s;e after his return to England, was
honoured with a very extraordinary eulogium, pronounced
by the Lord-Keeper, in the name of the Peers of England;
and a compliment of the &s;ame nature was pre&s;ented to him
by a committee of the Hou&s;e of Commons. Doctor De|laune,
vice-chancellor of Oxford, accompanied by the
principal members of the univer&s;ity, attended the Queen
with an addre&s;s of congratulation upon the &s;ucce&s;s of her
arms in Germany, under the admirable conduct and in|vincible
courage of the Duke of Marlborough; and at &s;ea,
under the mo&s;t brave and faithful Admiral Sir George
Rooke. He received a civil an&s;wer from her Maje&s;ty,
though now &s;he took umbrage at Rooke's being rai&s;ed
upon a level with the Duke of Marlborough, who&s;e great
victories had captivated her admiration, and who&s;e wife
had alienated her affection from the Tories. The Com|mons
perceiving how high he &s;tood in her Maje&s;ty's e&s;teem,
and having been properly tutored for the purpo&s;e, took
into con&s;ideration the great &s;ervices of the Duke; and, in
an addre&s;s, be&s;ought her Maje&s;ty to con&s;ider &s;ome proper
means to perpetuate the memory of &s;uch noble actions. In
a few days &s;he gave them to under&s;tand by a me&s;&s;age, that
&s;he was inclined to grant the intere&s;t of the crown in the
honour and manour of Wood&s;tock and hundred of Wooton
to the Duke of Marlborough and his heirs; and that as the
lieutenancy and ranger&s;hip of the parks, with the rents and
profits of the manours and hundreds, were granted for two
lives, &s;he wi&s;hed that incumberance could be removed. A
<PB N="40" REF="44">
bill was immediately brought in, enabling the Queen to
be&s;tow the&s;e honours and manours on the Duke of Marl|borough
and his heirs; and the Queen was de&s;ired to ad|vance
the money for clearing the incumberances. She not
only complied with this addre&s;s, but likewi&s;e ordered the
comptroller of her works to build, in Wood&s;tock-park, a
magnificent palace for the Duke, upon a plan much more
&s;olid than beautiful. By this time Sir George Rooke was
laid a&s;ide, and the command of the &s;leet be&s;towed upon
Sir Cloude&s;ley Shovel, now declared rear-admiral of Eng|land.
Mare&s;chal de Tallard, with the other French ge|nerals
taken at Hoch&s;tadt, arrived on the &s;ixteenth of De|cember
in the River Thames, and were immediatly con|veyed
to Nottingham and Lichfield, attended by a detach|ment
of the royal regiment of hor&s;e-guards. They were
treated with great re&s;pect, and allowed the privilege of
riding ten miles around the places of their confinement.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVII. While the Hou&s;e of Commons, in two
&s;ucce&s;&s;ive addre&s;&s;es, thanked the Queen for the treaty
which the Duke of Marlborough had concluded with
Pru&s;&s;ia, concerning the troops to be &s;ent to the Duke of
Savoy; and de&s;ired &s;he would u&s;e her intere&s;t with the
allies, that they might next year furni&s;h their complete
proportions of men by &s;ea and land; the Lords examined
into all the proceedings at &s;ea, and all the in&s;tructions of
the Admiralty; and pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the Queen,
explaining all the different articles of mi&s;management.
She promi&s;ed to con&s;ider them particularly, and give &s;uch
directions upon them as might be mo&s;t for the advantage
of the publick &s;ervice. The remaining part of the
&s;e&s;&s;ion was con&s;umed in di&s;putes and altercations between
the two Hou&s;es on the &s;ubject of the Ayle&s;bury con&s;ta|bles,
who were &s;ued by five other inhabitants for having
denied them the right of voting at the election. The&s;e
five per&s;ons were committed to Newgate by order of the
Hou&s;e of Commons. They moved for a habeas corpus in
the King's-Bench; but the court would take no cogni|zance
of the affair. Two of the pri&s;oners petitioned the
<PB N="41" REF="45">
Queen that their ca&s;e might be brought before her Ma|je&s;ty
in parliament. The Commons, in an addre&s;s, be|&s;ought
the Queen to refu&s;e granting a writ of error in this
ca&s;e, which would tend to the overthrowing the undoubted
rights and privileges of the Commons of England. She
a&s;&s;ured them &s;he would not do any thing to give them ju&s;t
cau&s;e of complaint; but this matter relating to the cour&s;e
of judicial proceedings, being of the highe&s;t importance,
&s;he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to weigh and con&s;ider very care|fully
what might be proper for her to do in a thing of &s;o
great concern. They voted all the lawyers who had
pleaded on the return of the habeas corpus in behalf of the
pri&s;oners guilty of a breach of privilege, and ordered them
to be taken into cu&s;tody. They likewi&s;e ordered the pri|&s;oners
to be removed from Newgate into the cu&s;tody of
their &s;erjeant at arms, le&s;t they &s;hould have been di&s;|charged
by the Queen's granting writs of error. The pri|&s;oners,
finding them&s;elves at the mercy of the exa&s;perated
Commons, petitioned the Lords for relief. The Upper
Hou&s;e pa&s;&s;ed &s;ix different re&s;olutions again&s;t the conduct of
the Commons, as being an ob&s;truction to ju&s;tice, and
contrary to magna charta. The Lower Hou&s;e demanded
a conference, in which they in&s;i&s;ted upon the &s;ole right of
determining elections: they affirmed, that they only could
judge who had a right of voting; and that they were
judges of their own privileges, in which the Lords could
not intermeddle.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVIII. The Upper Hou&s;e demanded a free con|ference,
which proved ineffectual. New re&s;olutions were
taken by the Commons, diametrically oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e of
the Peers, who, on the other hand, attended the Queen
with a long repre&s;entation of all the particulars relating to
this affair. They a&s;&s;irmed that the proceedings of the
Hou&s;e of Commons again&s;t the Ayle&s;bury men were
wholly new and unprecedented: that it was the birthright
of every Engli&s;hman, who apprehended him&s;elf injured,
to &s;eek for redre&s;s in her Maje&s;ty's courts of ju&s;tice: that
if any power could control this right, and pre&s;cribe when

The Duke of Buckingham&s;hire was deprived of the privy-&s;eal,
and that office conferred upon the Duke of New-ca&s;tle,
a nobleman of powerful influence with the Whig
party. The Earl of Montague was created Marquis of
Mounthermer and Duke of Montague: the Earl of Pe|terborough

&sect; XXIX. The mini&s;try of Scotland was now entirely
changed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VIII. 1705.</NOTE> The Marquis of Tweedale and John&s;ton, hav|ing
been found unequal to the undertaking, were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed.
The Duke of Queen&s;berry re&s;umed the management of
affairs in that kingdom, under the title of lord privy-&s;eal;
and the office of commi&s;&s;ioner was conferred upon the
young Duke of Argyle, who &s;ucceeded to his father's in|fluence
among the pre&s;byterians. He was a nobleman
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of good natural talents which had not been
neglected; candid, open, and &s;incere, brave, pa&s;&s;ionate,
and a&s;piring: had he been endued with a greater &s;hare of
liberality, his character would have been truely heroick.
At this juncture he was in&s;tructed to procure an act of the
Scotti&s;h parliament &s;ettling the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; or
to &s;et on foot a treaty for the union of the two kingdoms.
At the opening of the &s;e&s;&s;ion in June the members were
divided into three parties, namely, the Cavaliers or Jaco|bites,
the Revolutioners, the &s;quadrone volante, or flying
&s;quadron, headed by the Marquis of Tweedale, who di&s;|claimed
the other two factions, and pretended to act from
the dictates of con&s;cience alone. The parliament was
adjourned to the third day of July, when her Maje&s;ty's
letter was read, earne&s;tly recommending the &s;ettlement of
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the prote&s;tant line, and an act for a com|mi&s;&s;ion
to treat of an union between the two kingdoms.
The Marquis of Annandale propo&s;ed that the parliament
&s;hould proceed on the limitations and conditions of go|vernment:
that a committee &s;hould be appointed to con|&s;ider
the condition of the coin and the commerce of the
nation. The Earl of Mar moved, that the Hou&s;e would,
preferably to all other bu&s;ine&s;s, con&s;ider the means for
engaging in a treaty with England. After a long debate
they re&s;olved to proceed on the coin and the commerce.
Schemes for &s;upplying the nation with money by a paper-credit
were pre&s;ented by Dr. Hugh Chamberlayne and
John Law; but rejected. The Hou&s;e re&s;olved, That any
kind of paper-credit, by the circulation of bills, was an
improper expedient; and appointed a council to put the
<PB N="44" REF="48">
laws relating to trade in execution.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK I. 1705.</NOTE> The Duke of Ha|milton
propo&s;ed that the parliament &s;hould not proceed to
the nomination of a &s;ucce&s;&s;or, until the treaty with Eng|land
&s;hould be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and the limitations &s;ettled
This propo&s;al being approved, a draft of an an&s;wer to
her Maje&s;ty's letter was pre&s;ented by the Marquis of
Tweedale. Two different forms of an act for a treaty
with England were offered by the Earl of Mar and the
Marquis of Lothian: others were produced concerning
the election of officers of &s;tate, and the regulation of com|merce.</P>
<P>&sect; XXX. The chief aim of the cavaliers was to ob&s;truct
the &s;ettlement of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and with that view they
pre&s;&s;ed the project of limitations, to which they knew the
court would never a&s;&s;ent. A motion being made, to grant
the fir&s;t reading to an act of commi&s;&s;ion for a treaty with
England, the Duke of Hamilton in&s;i&s;ted on the limitations,
and a vote being &s;tated in the&s;e terms, &startq;Proceed to con|&s;ider
the act for a treaty or limitation,&endq; the latter was
carried in favour of the cavaliers. On the twenty-&s;econd
day of Augu&s;t an act for this purpo&s;e was approved; and
next day an act for a triennial parliament, which the
courtiers were enabled to defeat. They likewi&s;e pa&s;&s;ed
an act, ordaining, That the Scotti&s;h amba&s;&s;adours repre|&s;enting
Scotland &s;hould be pre&s;ent when the &s;overeign
might have occa&s;ion to treat with foreign princes and
&s;tates, and be accountable to the parliament of Scotland.
Fletcher, of Saltoun, pre&s;ented a &s;cheme of limitations that
&s;avoured &s;trong of republican principles. He afterwards
enlarged upon every article, endeavouring to prove that
they were ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to prevent the con&s;equences
of Engli&s;h influence; to enable the nation to defend its
rights and liberties; to deter mini&s;ters of &s;tate from giving
bad advice to their &s;overeign; to pre&s;erve the courts of
judicature from corruption, and &s;creen the people from
tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion. The Earl of Stair having argued
again&s;t the&s;e limitations. Fletcher replied, &startq;It was no
wonder he oppo&s;ed the &s;cheme; for, had &s;uch an act
<PB N="45" REF="49">
&s;ub&s;i&s;ted, his Lord&s;hip would have been hanged for the
bad council he had given to King James; for the con|cern
he had in the ma&s;&s;acre of Glencoe; and for his
conduct &s;ince the Revolution.&endq; The next &s;ubject on
which the parliament deliberated was the con&s;piracy. A
motion being made that the Hou&s;e might know what
an&s;wer the Queen had returned to their addre&s;s in the la&s;t
&s;e&s;&s;ion, the Chancellor delivered to the Clerk-Regi&s;ter
the papers relating to the plot, that they might be peru&s;ed
by the members; but the&s;e being copies, and the evi|dences
remaining at London, no further progre&s;s was
made in the affair. Yet the Duke of Athol, in a di&s;tinct
narrative of the pretended con&s;piracy, boldly accu&s;ed the
Duke of Queen&s;berry of having endeavoured to mi&s;lead
the Queen by fal&s;e in&s;inuations again&s;t her good &s;ubjects.
When the act for a treaty of union fell under con&s;idera|tion,
a draft for that purpo&s;e, pre&s;ented by the Earl of
Mar, was compared with the Engli&s;h act, importing,
That the Queen &s;hould name and appoint not only the
commi&s;&s;ioners for England, but likewi&s;e tho&s;e for Scot|land.
Fletcher did not fail to inveigh again&s;t the impe|rious
conduct of the Engli&s;h parliament in this affair. He
exhorted the Hou&s;e to re&s;ent &s;uch treatment, and offered
the draft of an addre&s;s to her Maje&s;ty on the &s;ubject;
but this the Hou&s;e rejected. Duke Hamilton propo&s;ed
that a clau&s;e might be added to the act, importing, That
the union &s;hould no ways derogate from any fundamental
laws, ancient privileges, offices, rights, liberties, and
dignities of the Scotti&s;h nation. This occa&s;ioned a long
debate; and, the que&s;tion being put, was carried in the
negative. Another clau&s;e was propo&s;ed, that the Scotti&s;h
commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould not begin to treat until the Engli&s;h
parliament &s;hould have re&s;einded their clau&s;e, enacting,
That the &s;ubjects of Scotland &s;hould be adjudged and
taken as aliens after the twenty-fifth day of December.
The courtiers, con&s;idering the temper of the Hou&s;e, would
not venture to oppo&s;e this motion directly, but propo&s;ed
that the clau&s;e &s;hould be formed into a &s;eparate act; and
<PB N="46" REF="50">
the expedient was approved. Though the Duke of Athol
entered a vigorous prote&s;t, to which the greater part of
the cavaliers, and all the &s;quadrons adhered, comprehend|ing
four-and-twenty peers, &s;even-and-thirty barons, and
eighteen boroughs, the act for the treaty of union was,
after much alteration, fini&s;hed, empowering commi&s;|&s;ioners
to meet and treat of an union; but re&s;training
them from treating of any alterations of the church-go|vernment
as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed. While this important
&s;ubject was under con&s;ideration, the Duke of Hamilton,
to the amazement of his whole party, moved that the
nomination of the commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould be left to the
Queen. Fourteen or fifteen of the cavaliers ran out of
the Hou&s;e in a tran&s;port of indignation, exclaiming that
they were de&s;erted and ba&s;ely betrayed by the Duke of
Hamilton. A very hot debate en&s;ued, in the cour&s;e of
which the Duke was &s;everely handled by tho&s;e whom he
had hitherto conducted; but, at length, the que&s;tion
being put, Whether the nomination &s;hould be left to the
Queen or to the parliament? the Duke's motion was ap|proved
by a very &s;mall majority. He afterwards excu&s;ed
him&s;elf for his defection, by &s;aying, he &s;aw it was in vain
to contend; and that, &s;ince the court had acquired a
great majority, he thought he might be allowed to pay
that compliment to his &s;overeign. He was de&s;irous of
being in the commi&s;&s;ion, and the Duke of Argyle pro|mi&s;ed
he &s;hould be nominated. The Queen refu&s;ing to
honour him with that mark of di&s;tinction, Argyle would
not &s;uffer him&s;elf to be named, and threatened to oppo&s;e
the union; but means were found to appea&s;e his re&s;ent|ment.
Two drafts of an addre&s;s being pre&s;ented by
the Earl of Sutherland and Fletcher, of Saltoun, be&s;eech|ing
her Maje&s;ty to u&s;e her endeavours with the parliament
of England, to re&s;eind that part of their act which de|clared
the &s;ubjects, of Scotland aliens; and an overture of
a bill being offered, ordaining that the Scotti&s;h commi&s;|&s;ioners
&s;hould not enter upon the treaty of union until that
clau&s;e &s;hould be repealed; the courtiers moved, that the
<PB N="47" REF="51">
parliament &s;hould proceed by way of order to their com|mi&s;&s;ioners,
and by addre&s;s to her Maje&s;ty. After &s;ome
debate the House a&s;&s;enting to this propo&s;al, the order and
addre&s;s were drawn up and approved. The great and
weighty affair of the treaty being at length happily
transacted, though not without a protest by Athol and his
adherents, the parliament granted a &s;upply of fifty thou&s;and
pounds, and the Hou&s;e was adjourned to the twentieth
day of December: then the Queen declared the Earl of
Mar &s;ecretary of &s;tate, in the room of the Marquis of
Annandale, who was appointed lord-pre&s;ident of the
council.</P>
<P>&sect;XXXI. In Ireland the parliament met at Dublin on
the fifth day of March, and voted one hundred and fifty
thou&s;and pounds for the &s;upport of the nece&s;&s;ary branches
of the e&s;tabli&s;hment. A di&s;pute aro&s;e between the Com|mons
and the Lower Hou&s;e of Convocation, relating to
the tithes of hemp and flax, a&s;certained in a clau&s;e of a
bill for the better improvement of the hempen and flaxen
manufactures of the kingdom. The Lower Hou&s;e of
Convocation pre&s;ented a memorial again&s;t this clau&s;e, as
prejudicial to the rights and properties of the clergy. The
Commons voted the per&s;on who brought it guilty of a
breach of privilege; and ordered him to be taken into
cu&s;tody. Then they re&s;olved, That the Convocation
were guilty of a contempt and breach of the privilege of
that Hou&s;e. The Convocation pre&s;uming to ju&s;tify their
memorial, the Commons voted, That all matters relating
to it &s;hould be razed out of the journals and books of Con|vocation.
The Duke of Ormond, dreading the con&s;e|quence
of &s;uch heats, adjourned the parliament to the fir&s;t
day of May, when the Hou&s;es meeting again, came to
&s;ome re&s;olutions that reflected obliquely on the Convoca|tion,
as enemies to her Maje&s;ty's government and the
prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The clergy, in order to acquit
them&s;elves of all &s;u&s;picion, re&s;olved in their turn, That
the church and nation had been happily delivered from
popery and tyranny by King William at the Revolution:
<PB N="48" REF="52">
That the continuance of the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings were due (under
God) to the au&s;picious reign and happy government of
her Maje&s;ty Queen Anne: That the future &s;ecurity and
pre&s;ervation of the church and nation depended wholly
(under God) on the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown as &s;ettled by
law in the prote&s;tant line: That if any clergyman &s;hould
by word or writing declare any thing in oppo&s;ition to
the&s;e re&s;olutions, they &s;hould look upon him as a &s;ower of
divi&s;ions among the prote&s;tants, and an enemy to the
con&s;titution. They levelled another re&s;olution again&s;t
the pre&s;byterians, importing, That to teach or preach
again&s;t the doctrine, government, rites, or ceremonies of
the church, or to maintain &s;chools or &s;eminaries for the
education of youth, in principles contrary to tho&s;e of the
e&s;tabli&s;hed church, was a contempt of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical
laws of the kingdom; of pernicious con&s;equence; and
&s;erved only to continue and widen the unhappy &s;chi&s;ms
and divi&s;ions in the nation. In June the parliament was
prorogued to the &s;ame month of the following year: then
the Duke of Ormond embarked for England, leaving the
admini&s;tration in the hands of Sir Richard Cox, lord|chancellor,
and the Lord Cutts, commander in chief of
the Queen's forces, who were appointed lords-ju&s;tices
during the Duke's ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXII. During the&s;e tran&s;actions in Great-Britain
and Ireland, the allies had not been remi&s;s in their prepa|rations
for the en&s;uing campaign. The Duke of Marlbo|rough
had fixed upon the Mo&s;elle for the &s;cene of action;
and magazines of all &s;orts were formed at Triers. On
the thirteenth day of March the Duke embarked for Hol|land,
where he prevailed upon the States-General to con|tribute
their troops for the execution of his project. Having
concerted with the deputies of the States and the Dutch
generals the nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures for opening the campaign,
he &s;et out for Mae&s;tricht, in order to a&s;&s;emble his army.
On the fifth day of May the Emperor Leopold died at
Vienna, and was &s;ucceeded on the Imperial throne by his
elde&s;t &s;on Jo&s;eph King of the Romans, a prince who
<PB N="49" REF="53">
re&s;embled his father in meekne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, narrowne&s;s
of intellect, and bigotry to the Romi&s;h religion. On the
fifteenth of June the Engli&s;h troops pa&s;&s;ed the Mae&s;e, and
continued their march towards the Mo&s;elle, under the
command of General Churchill; and the Duke &s;et out
for Creutznach, to con&s;er with Prince Louis of Baden,
who excu&s;ed him&s;elf on pretence of being much indi&s;po&s;ed.
Marlborough vi&s;ited him at Ra&s;tadt, where in a confe|rence
they re&s;olved that a &s;ufficient number of German
troops &s;hould be left for the &s;ecurity of the lines of Lauter|burg
and Stolhoffen, under the command of General
Thungen; and that Prince Louis of Baden &s;hould march
with a large detachment towards the Saar, to act in con|cert
with the Duke of Marlborough. The confederate
army pa&s;&s;ed the Mo&s;elle and the Saar in the beginning of
June, and encamped at Elft in &s;ight of the enemy, who
retired with great precipitation, and entrenched them&s;elves
in the neighbourhood of Coning&s;macheren. The Duke's
de&s;ign was to be&s;iege Saar-Louis; but Prince Louis failed
in the performance of his engagement: he feigned him&s;elf
&s;ick, and repaired to the bath at Schlangenbade, leaving
the &s;mall number of Imperial troops he had conducted as
far as Creutznach, under the command of the Count de
Frize. He was &s;u&s;pected of treachery; but probably acted
from envy of the Duke's military reputation.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The Duke of Marlborough, finding him&s;elf obliged to retreat, &s;ent a note with a trumpeter to Villars, containing an apology for decamping.&mdash; &startq;Do me the ju&s;tice (&s;aid he) to believe that my retreat is entirely owing to the failure of the Prince of Baden; but that my e&s;teem for you is &s;till greater than my re&s;entment of his conduct.&endq;</NOTE>.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIII. While this nobleman &s;u&s;tained &s;uch a mor|tifying
di&s;appointment on the Mo&s;elle, the French did
not fail to make advantage of their &s;uperiority in the Ne|therlands,
where General D'Auverquerque was obliged to
&s;tand on the defen&s;ive. They inve&s;ted Huy, and carried
on their operations &s;o vigorou&s;ly, that in a few days the
garri&s;on were obliged to &s;urrender them&s;elves pri&s;oners of
war: then Villeroy undertook the reduction of Liege, and
actually began his works before the citadel. Marlborough
<PB N="50" REF="54">
was no &s;ooner informed of the enemy's progre&s;s than he
marched to Triers, where, in a council, it was re&s;olved
that the army &s;hould return to the Netherlands. The
troops were in motion on the nineteenth of June, and
marched with &s;uch expedition, that they pa&s;&s;ed the Mae&s;e
on the fir&s;t day of July. Villeroy having received advice
of the Duke's approach, abandoned his enterpri&s;e, and
retired to Tongeren, from whence he retreated within his
lines, that reached from Marche aux Dames on the Meu&s;e,
along the Mehaigne, as far as Lenuive. Marlborough
having joined D'Auverquerque, &s;ent General Scholten with
a detachment to inve&s;t Huy; and in a few days the gar|ri&s;on
&s;urrendered at di&s;cretion. The Engli&s;h general re|&s;olving
to &s;trike &s;ome &s;troke of importance that &s;hould
atone for his di&s;appointment on the Mo&s;elle, &s;ent General
Hompe&s;ch to the States, with a propo&s;al for attacking
the French lines; and obtained their permi&s;&s;ion to do
whatever he &s;hould think proper for the good of the com|mon
cau&s;e. Then he explained the &s;cheme in two &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive
councils of war, by which, at length, it was ap|proved
and re&s;olved upon, though &s;ome Dutch generals
declared them&s;elves again&s;t the undertaking. The enemy
were po&s;ted along the lines, amounting to one hundred
battalions and one hundred and forty-&s;ix &s;quadrons. The
allied army did not much exceed that number. In order
to divide them, D'Auverquerque made a fal&s;e motion and
pa&s;&s;ed the Mehaigne, as if he had intended to attack the
lines about Me&s;&s;elin. The &s;tratagem &s;ucceeded. The
French weakened the other parts by &s;trengthening that
which was on the &s;ide of the Gerbi&s;e towards Namur.
The Duke of Marlborough having made the di&s;po&s;ition,
the army began to march in the night between the &s;even|teenth
and eighteenth of July, in order to force a pa&s;&s;age
of the French lines at Heyle&s;em, the ca&s;tle of Wauge,
and the villages of Wauge, Neerhespen, and Oo&s;tmalen.
The&s;e po&s;ts were taken with very little difficulty: but,
before the in&s;antry could come up, the enemy advanced
with fifty &s;quadrons and twenty battalions, and began to
<PB N="51" REF="55">
fire from eight pieces of cannon with triple barrels, which
did con&s;iderable execution. The Duke perceiving that
they were continually re-enforced from the other parts of
the lines, ordered the hor&s;e to charge their cavalry, which
were &s;oon broken and routed: but rallying behind their
infantry, interlined with foot, and joined by fre&s;h &s;qua|drons,
they advanced again towards the allies, who were
now &s;u&s;tained by their infantry, and moved forwards to
renew the charge. After a warm, though &s;hort engage|ment,
the enemy's hor&s;e were defeated with great &s;laughter.
The infantry, &s;eeing them&s;elves abandoned in the plain,
retreated in great di&s;order, between the villages of Heyle&s;em
and Gol&s;teven, where they were joined by the re&s;t of
their army, and formed again in order of battle. Mean
while the Duke of Marlborough ordered all his troops to
enter the lines; and extended his right towards the Great
Geete before Tirlemont, where the enemy had left the
battalion of Montluc, which &s;urrendered at di&s;cretion.
In this action the confederates took the Marquis D'Alegre
and the Count de Horne, lieutenant-generals, one major-general,
two brigadier-generals, with many other officers,
and a great number of common soldiers; a large heap of
&s;tandards, four colours, one pair of kettle-drums, and
ten pieces of cannon. In the action, as the Duke of
Marlborough advanced to the charge at the head of &s;everal
&s;quadrons, a Bavarian officer rode up to attack him &s;word
in hand; but in rai&s;ing him&s;elf on his &s;tirrups to &s;trike
with the greater advantage, he fell from his hor&s;e, and was
immediately &s;lain.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIV. The body of troops commanded by Mon|&s;ieur
D'Alegre being thus defeated with little or no lo&s;s to
the confederates, the Elector of Bavaria and the Mare&s;chal
de Villeroy pa&s;&s;ed the Great Geete and the Deule, with
great expedition, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;trong camp
at Parck, their left extending to Roo&s;elaer, and their right
to Wine&s;elen again&s;t the height of Louvain. Next day
the Duke of Marlborough marching through the plain of
Parck, took twelve hundred pri&s;oners, who could not
<PB N="52" REF="56">
keep pace with the re&s;t of the enemy's forces; and in the
evening he encamped with the right at the abbey of
Vlier&s;beck, and the left before Bierbeck, under the cannon
of Louvain. He detached Lieutenant-General Henkelum,
the Duke of Wirtemberg, and Count Oxien&s;tiern, with
a con&s;iderable body of forces, to attack &s;ome po&s;ts on the
Deule, which were &s;lenderly guarded. Their advanced
guard accordingly pa&s;&s;ed the river, and repul&s;ed the enemy:
but, for want of timely &s;upport, they were obliged to pa&s;s
it and retire. On the third of Augu&s;t Baron Spaar, with
a body of Dutch troops, marched to Raboth on the canal
of Bruges, forced the French lines at Lovendegen, and
took four forts by which they were defended; but receiv|ing
advice that the enemy were on their march towards
him, he retired to Mildegem, and carried with him &s;everal
ho&s;tages, as &s;ecurity for the payment of the contributions
he had rai&s;ed. On the fifteenth the Duke moved from
Mildert to Corbais; next day continued his march to
Genap, from whence he advanced to Fi&s;chermont. On
the &s;eventeenth General D'Auverquerque took the po&s;t of
Waterlo; and next day the confederate army was drawn
up in order of battle before the enemy, who extended from
Overy&s;che, near the wood of Soignies, to Neery&s;che, with
the little river Y&s;che in their front, &s;o as to cover Bru&s;&s;els
and Louvain. The Duke of Marlborough propo&s;ed to
attack them immediately before they &s;hould recollect them|&s;elves
from their con&s;ternation; and D'Auverquerque ap|proved
of the de&s;ign: but it was oppo&s;ed by General
Schlangenburg, and other Dutch officers, who repre|&s;ented
it in &s;uch a light to the deputies of the States, that
they refu&s;ed to concur in the execution. The Duke
being obliged to relinqui&s;h the &s;cheme, wrote an expo&s;tu|latory
letter to the States-General, complaining of their
having withdrawn that con&s;idence which they had repo&s;ed
in him while he acted in Germany. This letter being
publi&s;hed at the Hague, excited murmurs among the
people; and the Engli&s;h nation were incen&s;ed at the pre|&s;umption
of the Deputies, who wrote &s;everal letters in
<PB N="53" REF="57">
their own ju&s;tification to the States-General: but the&s;e
had no effect upon the populace, by whom the Duke was
re&s;pected even to a degree of adoration. The States being
appri&s;ed of the re&s;entment that prevailed over all England,
and that the Earl of Pembroke, lord-pre&s;ident of the
council, was appointed as envoy extraordinary to Holland,
with in&s;tructions to demand &s;atisfaction, thought proper
to anticipate his journey, by making &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to the
Duke, and removing Schlangenburg from his command.
The confederate army returned to Corbais, from whence
it marched to Perwitz, where it encamped. The little
town of Sout-Leeuwe, &s;ituated in the middle of a mora&s;s,
and constituting the chief defence of the enemy's lines,
being taken by a detachment under the command of Lieute|nant-General
Dedem, the Duke ordered the lines from
this place to Wa&s;&s;eigne to be levelled, and the town of
Tirlemont to be di&s;mantled: then pa&s;&s;ing the Demer, he
encamped on the nineteenth of September at Aer&s;chot.
About the latter end of the month he marched to He|venthals:
from hence the Duke repaired to the Hague,
where he had &s;everal conferences with the Pen&s;ionary. In
a few days he returned to the army, which decamping
from Heventhals, marched to Clampthout. On the
twenty-fourth day of October the Count de Noyelles in|ve&s;ted
Santvliet, which &s;urrendered before the end of the
month.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXV. At this period the Duke, in con&s;equence of
pre&s;&s;ing letters from the Emperor, &s;et out for Vienna, in
order to concert the operations of the en&s;uing campaign,
and other mea&s;ures of importance, in which the concerns
of the allies were intere&s;ted. In his way he was magni|ficently
entertained by the Elector Palatine, and him of
Triers, and complimented by the magi&s;tracy of Francfort,
where he conferred with Prince Louis of Baden. On the
twelfth of November he arrived at Vienna, where he was
treated with the highe&s;t marks of di&s;tinction and cordial
friend&s;hip by their Imperial maje&s;ties. His &s;on-in-law, the
Earl of Sunderland, had been &s;ent thither as envoy extra|ordinary;
<PB N="54" REF="58">
and now they conferred together with the Em|peror
and his mini&s;ters. They re&s;olved to maintain the
war with redoubled vigour. The treaties were renewed,
and provi&s;ion made for the &s;ecurity of the Duke of Savoy.
The Emperor, in con&s;ideration of the Duke's &s;ignal &s;er|vice
to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, pre&s;ented him with a grant
of the lord&s;hip of Mindelheim in Suabia, which was now
erected into a principality of the Roman empire. In his
return with the Earl of Sunderland he vi&s;ited the courts
of Berlin and Hanover, where he was received with that
extraordinary re&s;pect which was due to his character; and
arrived at the Hague on the fourteenth day of December.
There he &s;ettled the operations of the next campaign with
the States-General, who con&s;ented to join England in
maintaining an additional body of ten thou&s;and men, as
a re-enforcement to the army of Prince Eugene in Italy.
While the allies were engaged in the &s;iege of Santvliet,
the Elector of Bavaria &s;ent a detachment, under the com|mand
of Don Marcello de Grimaldi, to inve&s;t Die&s;t, the
garri&s;on of which were made pri&s;oners of war.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVI. On the Upper Rhine Mare&s;chal Villars
be&s;ieged and took Homburg, and pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine at
Stra&s;burg on the &s;ixth day of Augu&s;t. Prince Louis of
Baden arriving in the camp of the Imperiali&s;ts at Stol|hoffen,
not only obliged him to retire, but having pa&s;&s;ed
the river, forced the French lines at Hagenau: then he
reduced Dru&s;enheim and Hagenau, but attempted no en|terpri&s;e
equal to the number of his army, although the
Emperor had expo&s;tulated with him &s;everely on his con|duct;
and he had now a fair opportunity of emulating
the glory of Marlborough, upon whom he looked with
the eyes of an envious rival. In Italy a battle was fought
at Ca&s;ano, between Prince Eugene and the Duke de
Vendome, with dubious &s;ucce&s;s. The Duke de Feuil|lade
reduced Chivas, and inve&s;ted Nice, which, after an
ob&s;tinate defence, &s;urrendered in December. All the con|&s;iderable
places belonging to the Duke of Savoy were now
taken, except Coni and Turin; and his little army was
<PB N="55" REF="59">
reduced to twelve thou&s;and men, whom he could hardly
&s;upport. His duche&s;s, his clergy, and his &s;ubjects in
general, pre&s;&s;ed him to &s;ubmit to the nece&s;&s;ity of his
affairs; but he adhered to the alliance with &s;urpri&s;ing
fortitude. He with&s;tood the importunities of his duche&s;s,
excluded all the bi&s;hops and clergy from his councils;
and, when he had occa&s;ion for a confe&s;&s;or, cho&s;e a prie&s;t
occa&s;ionally, either from the Dominicans or Franci&s;cans.
The campaign in Portugal began with a very promi&s;ing
a&s;pect. The allies invaded Spain by the different frontiers
of Beyra and Alentejo. Their army, under the command
of the Conde das Galveas, undertook the &s;iege of Valencia
D'Alcantara in May, and took it by a&s;&s;ault: Albu|querque
&s;urrendered upon articles; and then the troops
were &s;ent into quarters of refre&s;hment. The Marquis de
las Minas, who commanded the Portugue&s;e in the pro|vince
of Beyra, reduced the town of Salva-terra, plun|dered
and burned Sarca; but was obliged to retire to Pe|namacos
at the approach of the enemy. Towards the end
of September the confederates being re-a&s;&s;embled, inve&s;ted
Badajox, by the advice of the Earl of Galway, who lo&s;t
his right-hand by a cannon-ball, and was obliged to be
carried off; &s;o that the conduct of the &s;iege was left to
General Fagel. He had made con&s;iderable progre&s;s to|wards
the reduction of the place, when the Marquis de
The&s;&s;$ found means to throw in a powerfull re-enforce|ment;
and then the confederates abandoned the enter|pri&s;e.
The war continued to rage in Hungary with va|rious
&s;ucce&s;s. Ragot&s;ki, though frequently wor&s;ted,
appeared &s;till in arms, and ravaged the country, which
became a &s;cene of mi&s;ery and de&s;olation. In Poland the
old Cardinal Primate owned Stani&s;laus, but died before the
coronation, which was performed by the Bi&s;hop of Cuja|via.
In the beginning of winter King Augu&s;tus had
pa&s;&s;ed through Poland in di&s;gui&s;e to the Mu&s;covite army,
which was put under his command in Lithuania; and the
campaign was protracted through the whole winter-&s;ea&s;on,
notwith&s;tanding the &s;everity of the weather in that
<PB N="56" REF="60">
northern climate. In the &s;pring the Swedi&s;h general,
Reinchild, obtained a complete victory over the Saxon ar|my,
which was either cut in pieces or taken, with their
camp, baggage, and artillery; yet the war was not ex|tingui&s;hed.
The King of Sweden continued ob&s;tinately
deaf to all propo&s;als of peace, and was become as &s;avage
in his manners, as brutal in his revenge.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVII. At &s;ea the arms of the allies were gene|rally
pro&s;perous. Philip of Spain being ob&s;tinately bent
upon retaking Gibraltar, &s;ent Mare&s;chal de The&s;&s;$ to
renew the &s;iege, while De Pointis was ordered to block up
the place by &s;ea with his &s;quadron. The&s;e French officers
carried on the &s;ege with &s;uch activity, that the Prince of
He&s;&s;e di&s;patched an expre&s;s to Li&s;bon with a letter, de&s;iring
Sir John Leake to &s;ail immediately to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. This
admiral having been re-enforced from England by Sir
Thomas Dilkes, with five &s;hips of the line and a body of
troops, &s;et sail immediately; and on the tenth day of
March de&s;cried five &s;hips of war hauling out of the bay of
Gibraltar. The&s;e were commanded by De Pointis in
per&s;on, to whom the Engli&s;h admiral gave cha&s;e. One
of them &s;truck, after having made a very flight re&s;i&s;tance;
and the re&s;t ran a&s;hore to the we&s;tward of Marbella, where
they were de&s;troyed. The remaining part of the French
&s;quadron had been blown from their anchors, and taken
&s;helter in the bay of Malaga; but now they &s;lipped their
cables, and made the be&s;t of their way to Toulon. The
Mare&s;chal de The&s;&s;e, in con&s;equence of this di&s;a&s;ter,
turned the &s;iege of Gibraltar into a blockade, and with|drew
the greater part of his forces. While Sir John Leake
was employed in this expedition, Sir George Byng, who
had been ordered to crui&s;e in &s;oundings for the protection
of trade, took a &s;hip of forty guns from the enemy, to|gether
with twelve privateers, and &s;even ve&s;&s;els richly laden
from the We&s;t-Indies.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVIII. But the mo&s;t eminent atchievement of
this &s;ummer, was the reduction of Barcelona, by the cele|brated
Earl of Peterborough and Sir Cloude&s;ley Shovel,
<PB N="57" REF="61">
who &s;ailed from St. Helen's in the latter end of May with
the Engli&s;h fleet, having on board a body of five thou&s;and
land-forces; and on the twentieth of June arrived at
Li&s;bon, where they were joined by Sir John Leake and the
Dutch admiral, Allemonde. In a council of war, they
determined to put to &s;ea with eight-and-forty &s;hips of the
line, which &s;hould be &s;tationed between Cape Spartel and
the bay of Cadiz, in order to prevent the junction of the
Toulon and Bre&s;t &s;quadrons. The Prince of He&s;&s;e-Darm&s;tadt
arriving from Gibraltar, a&s;&s;ured King Charles,
that the province of Catalonia and the kingdom of Valen|cia
were attached to his intere&s;t; and his Maje&s;ty being
weary of Portugal, re&s;olved to accompany the Earl of
Peterborough to Barcelona. He accordingly embarked
with him on board of the Ranelagh; and the fleet &s;ailed
on the twenty-eighth day of July, the Earl of Galway
having re-enforced them with two regiments of Engli&s;h
dragoons. At Gibraltar they took on board the Engli&s;h
guards, and three old regiments, in lieu of which they
left two new-rai&s;ed battalions. On the eleventh day of
Augu&s;t they anchored in the bay of Altea, where the Earl
of Peterborough publi&s;hed a manife&s;to in the Spani&s;h
language, which had &s;uch an effect, that all the inhabi|tants
of the place, the neighbouring villages, and adjacent
mountains, acknowledged King Charles as their lawful
&s;overeign. They &s;ei&s;ed the town of Denia for his &s;ervice;
and he &s;ent thither a garri&s;on of four hundred men under
the command of Major General Ramos. On the twenty-&s;econd
they arrived in the bay of Barcelona: the troops
were di&s;embarked to the ca&s;tward of the city, where they
encamped in a &s;trong &s;ituation, and were well received by
the country people. King Charles landed amid&s;t the ac|clamations
of an in$inite multitude from the neighbour|ing
towns and villages, who threw them&s;elves at his feet,
exclaiming, &startq;Long live the King!&endq; and exhibited all
the marks of the mo&s;t extravagant joy. The inhabitants
of Barcelona were well affected to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria,
but overawed by a garri&s;on of five thou&s;and men under
<PB N="58" REF="62">
the Duke de Popoli, Vala&s;co, and other officers devoted
to the intere&s;t of King Philip. Con&s;idering the &s;trength
of &s;uch a garri&s;on, and the &s;mall number of Dutch and
Engli&s;h troops, nothing could appear more de&s;perate and
dangerous than the de&s;ign of be&s;ieging the place; yet this
was propo&s;ed by the Prince of He&s;&s;e-Darm&s;tadt, who
&s;erved in the expedition as a volunteer, &s;trongly urged by
King Charles, and approved by the Earl of Peterborough
and Sir Cloude&s;ley Shovel. The city was accordingly in|ve&s;ted
on one &s;ide; but, as a previous &s;tep to the reduc|tion
of it, they re&s;olved to attack the fort of Montjuic,
&s;trongly &s;ituated on a hill that commanded the city. The
outworks were taken by &s;torm, with the lo&s;s of the gal|lant
Prince of He&s;&s;e, who was &s;hot through the body, and
expired in a few hours: then the Earl of Peterborough
began to bombard the body of the fort; and a &s;hell
chancing to fall into the magazine of powder, blew it up,
together with the governor and &s;ome of the be&s;t officers;
an accident which &s;truck &s;uch a terror into the garri&s;on,
that they &s;urrendered without further re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIX. This great point being gained, the Engli&s;h
general erected his batteries again&s;t the town, with the
help of the Miquelets and &s;eamen: the bomb-ketches
began to fire with &s;uch execution, that in a few days the
governor capitulated, and on the fourth day of October
King Charles entered in triumph<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Voltaire, upon what authority we know not, tells us, that during the capitulation, the German and Catalonian troops found means to climb over the ramparts into the city, and began to commit the mo&s;t barbarous exce&s;&s;es: the Vicer$y complained to Peterborough that his &s;oldiers had taken an unfair advantage of the treaty, and were actually employed in burning, plundering, murthering, and violating the inhabitants. The Earl replied, &startq;They mu&s;t then be the troops of the Prince of He&s;&s;e: allow me to enter the city with my Engli&s;h forces: I will &s;ave it from ruin; oblige the Germans to retire, and march back again to our pre&s;ent &s;ituation.&endq; The Viceroy tru&s;ted his honour, and forthwith admitted the Earl with his troops. He &s;oon drove out the Germans and Catalonians, after having obliged them to quit the plunder they had taken; and by accident he re&s;cued the Du|che&s;s of Popoli from the hands of two brutal &s;oldiers, and delivered her to her hu&s;band. Having thus appea&s;ed the tumult and di&s;pelled the horrours of the citizens, he returned to his former &s;tation, leaving the inhabitants of Barcelona amazed at &s;uch an in&s;tance of magnanimity and moderation in a people whom they had been taught to con&s;ider as the mo&s;t &s;avage barbarians.</NOTE> All the other places
in Catalonia declared for him, except Ro&s;es; &s;o that the
<PB N="59" REF="63">
large&s;t and riche&s;t province of Spain was conquered with
an army &s;carce double the number of the garri&s;on of Bar|celona.
King Charles wrote a letter with his own hand
to the Queen of England, containing a circum&s;tantial
detail of his affairs, the warme&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of acknow|ledgment,
and the highe&s;t encomiums on her &s;ubjects,
particularly the Earl of Peterborough. In a council of
war it was determined that the King and the Earl &s;hould
continue in Catalonia with the land-forces: that Sir
Cloude&s;ley Shovel &s;hould return to England; that five-and-twenty
Engli&s;h and fifteen Dutch &s;hips of war &s;hould
winter at Li&s;bon, under the command of Sir John Leake
and the Dutch rear-admiral, Wa&s;&s;enaer; and that four
Engli&s;h and two Dutch frigates &s;hould remain at Barce|lona.
Don Franci&s;co de Vela&s;co was tran&s;ported to Ma|laga
with about a thou&s;and men of his garri&s;on; the re&s;t
voluntarily engaged in the &s;ervice of King Charles, and &s;ix
other regiments were rai&s;ed by the &s;tates of Catalonia.
The Count de Cifuentes, at the head of the Miquelets
and Catalans attached to the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, &s;ecured
Tarragona, Torto&s;a, Lerida, San-Mattheo, Gironne,
and other places. Don Raphael Nevat, revolting from
Philip with his whole regiment of hor&s;e, joined General
Ramos at Denia, and made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of &s;everal
places of importance in the kingdom of Valencia. Flu&s;hed
with &s;uch unexpected &s;ucce&s;s they penetrated to the capital
of the &s;ame name, which they &s;urpri&s;ed, together with
the Marquis de Villa-Garcia, the viceroy, and the arch|bi&s;hop.
The&s;e advantages, however, were not properly
improved. The court of Charles was divided into
factions, and &s;o much time lo&s;t in di&s;putes, that the
enemy &s;ent a body of &s;ix thou&s;and men into the kingdom
of Valencia, under the command of the Conde de las
Torres, who forthwith inve&s;ted San-Mattheo, guarded
<PB N="60" REF="64">
by Colonel Jones at the head of five hundred Miquelets.
This being a place of great con&s;equence, on account of
its &s;ituation, the Earl of Peterborough marched thither
with one thou&s;and infantry, and two hundred dragoons;
and by means of feigned intelligence artfully conveyed to
the Conde, induced that general to abandon the &s;iege with
precipitation, in the apprehen&s;ion of being &s;uddenly at|tacked
by a con&s;iderable army. Peterborough afterwards
took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Nules, and purcha&s;ing hor&s;es at Ca&s;tillon
de la Plana, began to form a body of cavalry, which did
good &s;ervice in the &s;equel. Having a&s;&s;embled a little army,
con&s;i&s;ting of ten &s;quadrons of hor&s;e and dragoons, and
four battalions of regular troops, with about three thou|&s;and
militia, he marched to Molviedro, which was
&s;urrendered to him by the governor, Brigadier Mahoni.
Between this officer and the Duke d'Arcos, the Spani&s;h
general, he excited &s;uch jealou&s;ies by dint of artifices not
altogether ju&s;tifiable even in war, that the Duke was
more intent upon avoiding the &s;uppo&s;ed treachery of Ma|honi
than upon interrupting the Earl's march to Valencia,
where the inhabitants expre&s;&s;ed uncommon marks of joy
at his arrival. About this period a very ob&s;tinate action
happened at St. I&s;tevan de Litera, where the Chevalier
D'Asfeldt, with nine &s;quadrons of hor&s;e and dragoons, and
as many battalions of French infantry, attacked Colonel
Wills at the head of a &s;mall detachment; but this la&s;t
being &s;upported by Lieutenant-General Cuningham, who
was mortally wounded in the engagement, repul&s;ed the
enemy, though three times his number, with the lo&s;s of
four hundred men killed upon the &s;pot. The troops on
both &s;ides fought with the mo&s;t de&s;perate valour, keeping
up their fire until the muzzles of their pieces met, and
charging each other at the point of bayonet. The only
misfortunate that attended the Engli&s;h arms in the cour&s;e
of this year was the capture of the Baltic fleet homeward-bound,
with their convoy of three &s;hips of war, which
were taken by the Dunkirk &s;quadron under the command
of the Count de St. Paul, though he him&s;elf was killed
<PB N="61" REF="65">
in the engagement. When an account of this advantage
was communicated to the French King, he replied with a
&s;igh, &startq;Very well, I wi&s;h the &s;hips were &s;afe again in any
Engli&s;h port, provided the Count de St. Paul could be
re&s;tored to life.&endq; After the death of the famous Du
Bart, this officer was counted the be&s;t &s;eaman in France.</P>
<P>&sect; XL. The kingdom of England was now wholly
engro&s;&s;ed by the election of members for the new parlia|ment.
The Tories exerted them&s;elves with great indu&s;try,
and propagated the cry of the church's being in danger;
a cry in which the Jacobites joined with great fervour:
but, notwith&s;tanding all their efforts, in word and writ|ing,
a majority of Whigs was returned; and now the
Lord Godolphin, who had hitherto maintained a neutra|lity,
thought proper openly to countenance that faction.
By his intere&s;t co-operating with the influence of the
Duche&s;s of Marlborough, Sir Nathan Wright was de|prived
of the great &s;eal, which was committed to Mr.
William Cowper, with the title of lord-keeper. This was
a lawyer of good extraction, &s;uperior talents, engaging
manners, and eminence in his profe&s;&s;ion. He was &s;taunch
to whig principles, and for many years had been con&s;i|dered
as one of their be&s;t &s;peakers in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons.
The new parliament meeting on the twenty-fifth
day of October, a violent conte&s;t aro&s;e about the choice
of a &s;peaker. Mr. Bromley was &s;upported by the Tories,
and the Whigs propo&s;ed Mr. John Smith, who was
elected by a majority of forty-three voices. The Queen
in her &s;peech repre&s;ented the nece&s;&s;ity of acting vigorou&s;ly
again&s;t France, as a common enemy to the liberties of
Europe: &s;he commended the fortitude of the Duke of
Savoy, which &s;he &s;aid was without example; &s;he told
them her intention was to expedite commi&s;&s;ions for treat|ing
of an union with Scotland: &s;he earne&s;tly recommended
an union of minds and affections among her people: &s;he
ob&s;erved, that &s;ome per&s;ons had endeavoured to foment
animo&s;ities, and even &s;ugge&s;ted in print, that the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
church was in danger: &s;he affirmed that &s;uch
<PB N="62" REF="66">
people were enemies to her and to the kingdom, and
meant only to cover de&s;igns which they dur&s;t not pub|lickly
own, by endeavouring to di&s;tract the nation with
unrea&s;onable and groundle&s;s di&s;tru&s;ts and jealou&s;ies: &s;he
declared &s;he would always affectionately &s;upport and coun|tenance
the church of England, as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed;
that &s;he would inviolably maintain the toleration; that
&s;he would promote religion and virtue, encourage trade,
and every thing el&s;e that might make them a happy and
flouri&s;hing people.</P>
<P>&sect; XLI. The majority in both Hou&s;es now profe&s;&s;ed the
&s;ame principles, and were well di&s;po&s;ed to &s;upport the
Queen in all her de&s;igns. They fir&s;t pre&s;ented the u&s;ual
addre&s;&s;es, in the warme&s;t terms of duty and affection.
Then the Commons drew up a &s;econd, a&s;&s;uring her they
would, to the utmo&s;t of their power, a&s;&s;i&s;t her in bringing
the treaty of union to a happy conclu&s;ion. They de&s;ired
that the proceedings of the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, relat|ing
to the union and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, might be laid before the
Hou&s;e. The Lords had &s;olicited the &s;ame &s;atisfaction;
and her Maje&s;ty promi&s;ed to comply with their reque&s;t.
The Lower Hou&s;e having heard and decided in &s;ome ca&s;es
of controverted elections, proceeded to take into con&s;ide|ration
the e&s;timates for the &s;ervice of the en&s;uing year, and
granted the &s;upplies without he&s;itation. In the Hou&s;e of
Lords, while the Queen was pre&s;ent, Lord Haver&s;ham,
at the end of a long &s;peech, in which he reflected upon
the conduct of the Duke of Marlborough, both on the
Mo&s;elle and in Brabant, moved for an addre&s;s to de&s;ire
her Maje&s;ty would invite the pre&s;umptive heir to the
crown of England to come and re&s;ide in the kingdom.
This motion was earne&s;tly &s;upported by the Duke of
Buckingham, the Earls of Roche&s;ter, Nottingham, and
Angle&s;ey. They &s;aid there was no method &s;o effectual to
&s;ecure the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, as that of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors being upon
the &s;pot, ready to a&s;&s;ume and maintain his or her right
again&s;t any pretender; and they ob&s;erved, that in former
times, when the throne of England was vacant, the fir&s;t
<PB N="63" REF="67">
comer had always &s;ucceeded in his preten&s;ions. The pro|po&s;al
was vehemently oppo&s;ed by the Whigs, who knew
it was di&s;agreeable to the Queen, whom they would not
venture to di&s;oblige. They argued, that a rivalry be|tween
the two courts might produce di&s;tractions, and be
attended with very ill con&s;equences; and ob&s;erved, that
the Prince&s;s Sophia had expre&s;&s;ed a full &s;atisfaction in the
a&s;&s;urances of the Queen, who had promi&s;ed to maintain
her title. The que&s;tion being put, was carried in the
negative by a great majority. The de&s;ign of the Tories
in making this motion was to bring the other party into di&s;|grace,
either with the Queen or with the people. Their
joining in the mea&s;ure would have given umbrage to their
&s;overeign; and, by oppo&s;ing it, they ran the ri&s;que of
incurring the publick odium, as enemies to the prote&s;tant
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion; but the pretence of the Tories was &s;o thin, the
nation &s;aw through it; and the &s;ole effect the motion pro|duced,
was the Queen's re&s;entment again&s;t the whole
party. Burnet, Bi&s;hop of Sarum, propo&s;ed that pro|vi&s;ion
might be made for maintaining the publick quiet,
in the interval between the Queen's decea&s;e, and the ar|rival
of her &s;ucce&s;&s;or; the motion was &s;econded by the
Lord-Trea&s;urer; and a bill brought in for the better &s;e|curity
of her Maje&s;ty's per&s;on and government, and of the
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown of England. By this act, a re|gency
was appointed of the &s;even per&s;ons that &s;hould po&s;|&s;e&s;s
the offices of Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, Lord Chan|cellor
or Lord-Keeper, Lord-Trea&s;urer, Lord-Pre&s;ident,
Lord Privy-Seal, Lord High-Admiral, and the Lord-Chief-Ju&s;tice
of the Queen's-Bench. Their bu&s;ine&s;s was
to proclaim the next &s;ucce&s;&s;or through the kingdom of
England, and join with a certain number of per&s;ons named
as regents by the &s;ucce&s;&s;or, in three li&s;ts, to be &s;ealed up
and depo&s;ited with the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, the
Lord-Keeper, and the Mini&s;ter Re&s;identiary of Hanover,
It was enacted, That the&s;e joint regencies &s;hould conduct
the admini&s;tration; that the la&s;t Parliament, even though
di&s;&s;olved, &s;hould re-a&s;&s;emble, and continue &s;itting for &s;ix
<PB N="64" REF="68">
months after the decea&s;e of her Maje&s;ty. The bill met
with a warm oppo&s;ition from the Tories, and did not
pa&s;s the Upper Hou&s;e without a prote&s;t. It was &s;till fur|ther
ob&s;tructed in the Hou&s;e of Commons even by &s;ome of
the Whig party, who were given to under&s;tand that the
Prince&s;s Sophia had expre&s;&s;ed an inclination to re&s;ide in
England. Exceptions were likewi&s;e taken to that clau&s;e
in the bill, enacting that the la&s;t parliament &s;hould be
re-a&s;&s;embled. They affirmed, that this was incon&s;i&s;tent
with part of the act by which the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was at fir&s;t
&s;ettled; for, among other limitations, the parliament had
provided, that when the crown &s;hould devolve to the
hou&s;e of Hanover, no man, who had either place or
pen&s;ion, &s;hould be capable of &s;itting in the Hou&s;e of
Commons. After tedious di&s;putes and zealous alterca|tion,
they agreed that a certain number of offices &s;hould
be &s;pecified as di&s;qualifying places. This &s;elf-denying
clau&s;e, and &s;ome other amendments, produced confe|rences
between the two Hou&s;es, and at length the bill
pa&s;&s;ed by their mutual a&s;&s;ent. Lord Haver&s;ham moved
for an enquiry into the mi&s;carriages of the la&s;t campaign,
hoping to find &s;ome foundation for cen&s;ure in the conduct
of the Duke of Marlborough; but the propo&s;al was re|jected
as invidious; and the two Hou&s;es pre&s;ented an ad|dre&s;s
to the Queen, de&s;iring &s;he would pre&s;erve a good
corre&s;pondence among all the confederates. They like|wi&s;e
concurred in repealing the act by which the Scots had
been alienated, and all the northern counties alarmed
with the apprehen&s;ion of a rupture between the two na|tions.
The Lord Shannon and Brigadier Stanhope arriv|ing
with an account of the expedition to Catalonia, the
Queen communicated the good news in a &s;peech to both
Hou&s;es, expre&s;&s;ing her hope that they would enable her
to pro&s;ecute the advantages which her arms had acquired.
The Commons were &s;o well plea&s;ed with the tidings, that
they forthwith granted two hundred and fifty thou&s;and
pounds for her Maje&s;ty's proportion in the expen&s;e of pro|&s;ecuting
the &s;ucce&s;&s;es already gained by King Charles III.
<PB N="65" REF="69">
for the recovery of the monarchy of Spain to the hou&s;e of
Au&s;tria. On the fifteenth day of November, the Queen
gave the royal a&s;&s;ent to an act for exhibiting a bill to natu|ralize
the Prince&s;s Sophia, and the i&s;&s;ue of her body.</P>
<P>&sect; XLII. The&s;e mea&s;ures being taken, the &s;ixth day of
December was appointed for enquiring into tho&s;e dangers
to which the Tories affirmed the church was expo&s;ed; and
the Queen attended in per&s;on, to hear the debates on this
intere&s;ting &s;ubject. The Earl of Roche&s;ter compared the
expre&s;&s;ions in the Queen's &s;peech at the beginning of the
&s;e&s;&s;ion to the law enacted in the reign of Charles II. de|nouncing
the penalties of trea&s;on again&s;t tho&s;e who &s;hould
call the King a papi&s;t; for which rea&s;on, he &s;aid, he
always thought him of that per&s;ua&s;ion. He affirmed that
the church's danger aro&s;e from the act of &s;ecurity in
Scotland, the ab&s;ence of the &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the crown, and
the practice of occa&s;ional conformity. He was an&s;wered
by Lord Hallifax, who, by way of recrimination, ob|&s;erved
that King Charles II. was a Roman catholick, at
lea&s;t his brother declared him a papi&s;t after his death;
that his brother and &s;ucce&s;&s;or was a known Roman catho|lick,
yet the church thought her&s;elf &s;ecure; and tho&s;e
patriots who &s;tood up in its defence were di&s;countenanced
and puni&s;hed: nay, when that &s;ucce&s;&s;or a&s;cended the
throne, and the church was apparently in the mo&s;t immi|nent
danger, by the high commi&s;&s;ion court and otherwi&s;e,
the nation was then indeed generally alarmed; and every
body knew who &s;at in that court, and entered deeply
into the mea&s;ures which were then pur&s;ued. Compton,
Bi&s;hop of London, declared that the church was in danger,
from profanene&s;s, irrelion, and the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the
pre&s;s. He complained, that &s;ermons were preached
wherein rebellion was countenanced, and re&s;i&s;tance to the
higher powers encouraged. He alluded to a &s;ermon
preached before the Lord Mayor, by Mr. Hoadley, now
Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter. Burnet of Sarum &s;aid the Bi&s;hop
of London was the la&s;t man who ought to complain of
that &s;ermon; for if the doctrine it contained was not good,
<PB N="66" REF="70">
he did not know what defence his lord&s;hip could make for
his appearing in arms at Nottingham. He affirmed the
church would be always &s;ubject to profanene&s;s and irreli|gion,
but that they were not now &s;o flagrant as they
u&s;ually had been; he &s;aid the &s;ociety &s;et up for reforma|tion
in London, and other cities, had contributed con&s;i|derably
to the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of vice; he was &s;ure the corpora|tion
for propagating the go&s;pel had done a great deal to|wards
in&s;tructing men in religion, by giving great numbers
of books in practical divinity; by erecting libraries in
country pari&s;hes; by &s;ending many able divines to the
foreign plantations, and founding &s;chools to breed up
children in the chri&s;tian knowledge; though to this ex|pen&s;e
very little had been contributed by tho&s;e who ap|peared
&s;o wonderfully zealous for the church. The Arch|bi&s;hop
of York expre&s;&s;ed his apprehen&s;ion of danger from
the increa&s;e of di&s;&s;enters; particularly from the many aca|demies
they had in&s;tituted; he moved that the judges
might be con&s;ulted with re&s;pect to the laws that were in
force again&s;t &s;uch &s;eminaries, and by what means they
might be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. Lord Wharton moved that the
judges might al&s;o be con&s;ulted about means of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing
&s;chools and &s;eminaries held by nonjurors; in one of which
the &s;ons of a noble lord in that Hou&s;e had been educated.
To this &s;arca&s;m the Archbi&s;hop replied, that his &s;ons were
indeed taught by Mr. Ellis, a &s;ober, virtuous man; but
that when he refu&s;ed the oath of abjuration, they were
immediately withdrawn from his in&s;tructions. Lord
Wharton proceeded to declare, that he had carefully
peru&s;ed a pamphlet entitled &startq;The Memorial,&endq; which
was &s;aid to contain a demon&s;tration that the church was
in danger; but all he could learn was, that the Duke of
Buckingham, the Earls of Roche&s;ter and Nottingham,
were out of place; that he remembered &s;ome of the&s;e no|blemen
&s;at in the high-commi&s;&s;ion court, and then made
no complaint of the church's being in danger. Patri$$
Bi&s;hop of Ely complained of the heat and pa&s;&s;ion mani|fe&s;ted
by the gentlemen belonging to the univer&s;ities; and
<PB N="67" REF="71">
of the undutiful behaviour of the clergy towards their
bi&s;hops. He was &s;econded by Hough of Lichfield and
Coventry, who added, that the inferior clergy calumniated
their bi&s;hops, as if they were in a plot to de&s;troy the
church, and had compounded to be the la&s;t of their order.
Hooper of Bath and Wells expatiated on the invidious
di&s;tinction implied in the terms &startq;High church,&endq; and
&startq;Low church.&endq; The Duke of Leeds a&s;&s;erted, that the
church could not be &s;afe, without an act again&s;t occa&s;ional
conformity. Lord Somers recapitulated all the arguments
which had been u&s;ed on both &s;ides of the que&s;tion; he de|clared
his own opinion was, that the nation was happy
under a wi&s;e and ju&s;t admini&s;tration; that for men to rai&s;e
groundle&s;s jealou&s;ies at that juncture, could mean no le&s;s
than an intention to embroil the people at home, and de|feat
the glorious de&s;igns of the allies abroad. The debate
being fini&s;hed, the que&s;tion was put, Whether the church
of England was in danger? and carried in the negative by
a great majority: then the Hou&s;e re&s;olved, That the church
of England as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed, which was re&s;cued from
the extreme&s;t danger by King William III. of glorious
memory, is now, by God's ble&s;&s;ing, under the happy
reign of her Maje&s;ty, in a mo&s;t &s;afe and flouri&s;hing condi|tion;
and that whoever goes about to &s;ugge&s;t or in&s;inuate
that the church is in danger, under her Maje&s;ty's admini|&s;tration,
is an enemy to the Queen, the church, and the
kingdom. Next day the Commons concurred in this de|termination,
and joined the Lords in an addre&s;s to the
Queen, communicating this re&s;olution, be&s;eeching her to
take effectual mea&s;ures for making it publick; and al&s;o
for puni&s;hing the authors and &s;preaders of the &s;editious and
&s;candalous reports of the church's being in danger. She
accordingly i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, containing the re&s;olu|tion
of the two Hou&s;es, and offering a reward for di&s;co|vering
the author of the memorial of the church of Eng|land,
and for apprehending David Edwards, a pro&s;e&s;&s;ed
papi&s;t, charged upon oath to be the printer and publi&s;her of
that libel.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="72">
&sect; XLIII. After a &s;hort adjournment, a committee of
the Lower Hou&s;e pre&s;ented the thanks of the Commons
to the Duke of Marlborough, for his great &s;ervices per|formed
to her Maje&s;ty and the nation in the la&s;t campaign,
and for his prudent negociations with her allies. This
nobleman was &s;uch credit with the people, that when
he propo&s;ed a loan of five hundred thou&s;and pounds to the
Emperor, upon a branch of his revenue in Sile&s;ia, the
money was advanced immediately by the merchants of
London. The kingdom was ble&s;&s;ed with plenty; the
Queen was univer&s;ally beloved; the people in general
were zealous for the pro&s;ecution of the war; the forces
were well paid; the trea&s;ury was punctual; and, though
a great quantity of coin was exported for the maintenance
of the war, the paper-currency &s;upplied the deficiency &s;o
well, that no murmurs were heard, and the publick credit
flouri&s;hed both at home and abroad. All the funds being
e&s;tabli&s;hed, one in particular for two millions and a half
by way of annuities for ninety-nine years, at &s;ix and a
half per cent; and all the bills having received the royal
a&s;&s;ent, the Queen went to the Hou&s;e of Peers on the
nineteenth day of March, where having thanked both
Hou&s;es for the repeated in&s;tances of their affection which
&s;he had received, &s;he prorogued the parliament to the
twenty-fir&s;t day of May following<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Among other bills pa&s;&s;ed during this &s;e&s;&s;ion was an act for abridging and reforming &s;ome proceedings in the common law and in Chancery.</NOTE>. The new convoca|tion,
in&s;tead of imitating the union and harmony of the
parliament, revived the divi&s;ions by which the former had
been di&s;tracted, and the two Hou&s;es &s;eemed to act with
more determined rancour again&s;t each other. The Upper
Hou&s;e having drawn up a warm addre&s;s of thanks to the
Queen, for her affectionate care of the church, the Lower
Hou&s;e refu&s;ed to concur; nor would they give any rea&s;on
for their di&s;&s;ent. They prepared another in a different
&s;train,<NOTE PLACE="marg">$u$net.</NOTE> which was rejected by the Archbi&s;hop.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bo$er.</NOTE> Then they
agreed to divers re&s;olutions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lockhart.</NOTE> a&s;&s;erting their right of having

him to impart this declaration to the bi&s;hops and
clergy, and to prorogue the Convocation to &s;uch time as
&s;hould appear mo&s;t convenient. When he communicated
this letter to the Lower Hou&s;e, the members were not a
little confounded; neverthele&s;s, they would not comply
with the prorogation, but continued to &s;it in defiance of
her Maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure.</P>

the &s;ixteenth day of April,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK I. 1706.</NOTE> in the council-chamber of the
Cockpit near Whitehall, which was the place appointed
for the conferences. Their commi&s;&s;ions being opened
and read by the re&s;pective &s;ecretaries, and introductory
&s;peeches being pronounced by the Lord-Keeper of Eng|land,
and the Lord-Chancellor of Scotland, they agreed
to certain preliminary articles, importing, That all the
propo&s;als &s;hould be made in writing, and every point,
when agreed, reduced to writing; That no points &s;hould
be obligatory, till all matters &s;hould be adju&s;ted in &s;uch
a manner as would be proper to be laid before the Queen,
and the two parliaments, for their approbation: That a
committee &s;hould be appointed from each commi&s;&s;ion, to
revi&s;e the minutes of what might pa&s;s, before they &s;hould
be in&s;erted in the books by the re&s;pective &s;ecretaries; and
that all the proceedings during the treaty &s;hould be kept
&s;ecret. The Scots were inclined to a foederal union,
like that of the United Provinces; but the Engli&s;h were
bent upon an incorporation, &s;o as that no Scotti&s;h parlia|ment
&s;hould ever have power to repeal the articles of the
treaty. The Lord-Keeper propo&s;ed that the two king|doms
of England and Scotland &s;hould be for ever united
into one realm, by the name of Great-Britain; That it
&s;hould be repre&s;ented by one and the &s;ame parliament;
and, That the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of this monarchy, failing heirs
of her Maje&s;ty's body, &s;hould be according to the limita|tions
mentioned in the act of parliament pa&s;&s;ed in the
reign of King William, intituled, An act for the further
<PB N="71" REF="75">
limitation of the crown,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VIII. 1706.</NOTE> and the better &s;ecuring the
rights and liberties of the &s;ubject. The Scotti&s;h com|mi&s;&s;ioners,
in order to comply in &s;ome mea&s;ure with the
popular clamour of their nation, pre&s;ented a propo&s;al, im|plying
that the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown of Scotland &s;hould
be e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the &s;ame per&s;ons mentioned in the act
of King William's reign: That the &s;ubjects of Scotland
&s;hould for ever enjoy all the rights and privileges of the
natives in England, and the dominions thereunto belong|ing;
and, That the &s;ubjects of England &s;hould enjoy the
like rights and privileges in Scotland: That there &s;hould
be a free communication and intercour&s;e of trade and na|vigation
between the two kingdoms, and plantations
thereunto belonging; and that all laws and &s;tatutes in
either kingdom, contrary to the terms of this union,
&s;hould be repealed. The Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners declined
entering into any con&s;iderations upon the&s;e propo&s;als, de|claring
them&s;elves fully convinced that nothing but an
entire union could &s;ettle a perfect and la&s;ting friend&s;hip
between the two kingdoms. The Scots acquie&s;ced in this
reply, and both &s;ides proceeded in the treaty, without any
other intervening di&s;pute. They were twice vi&s;ited by the
Queen, who exhorted them to accelerate the articles of a
treaty that would prove &s;o advantageous to both kingdoms.
At length they were fini&s;hed, arranged, and mutually
&s;igned, on the twenty-&s;econd of July, and next day pre|&s;ented
to her Maje&s;ty, at the palace of St. James's, by
the Lord-Keeper, in the name of the Engli&s;h commi&s;|&s;ioners;
at the &s;ame time a &s;ealed copy of the in&s;trument
was likewi&s;e delivered by the Lord Chancellor of Scot|land;
and each made a &s;hort oration on the &s;ubject, to
which the Queen returned a very gracious reply. That
&s;ame day &s;he dictated an order of council, that whoever
&s;hould be concerned in any di&s;cour&s;e or libel, or in laying
wagers relating to the union, &s;hould be pro&s;ecuted with
the utmo&s;t rigour of the law.</P>
<P>&sect; XLV. In this famous treaty it was &s;tipulated, That
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the united kingdom of Great-Britain
<PB N="72" REF="76">
&s;hould be ve&s;ted in the Prince&s;s Sophia, and her heirs,

the &s;ame prohibitions, re&s;trictions, and regulations, with
re&s;pect to commerce and cu&s;toms; That Scotland &s;hould
not be charged with the temporary duties on &s;ome certain
commodities; That the &s;um of three hundred, ninety-eight
thou&s;and and eighty-five pounds, ten &s;hillings,
&s;hould be granted to the Scots, as an equivalent for &s;uch
parts of the cu&s;toms and exci&s;e charged upon that kingdom,
in con&s;equence of the union, as would be applicable to the

<P>&sect; I. WHILE this treaty was on the carpet at home,
the allied arms pro&s;pered &s;urpri&s;ingly in the
Netherlands, in Spain, and in Piedmont. The French
King had re&s;olved to make very con&s;iderable efforts in
the&s;e countries; and, indeed, at the beginning of the cam|paign
his armies were very formidable. He hoped that,
by the reduction of Turin and Barcelona, the war would
be extingui&s;hed in Italy and Catalonia. He knew he
could out number any body of forces that Prince Louis of
Baden &s;hould a&s;&s;emble on the Rhine; and he re&s;olved to
re-enfoce his army in Flanders, &s;o as to be in a condition
to act offen&s;ively again&s;t the Duke of Marlborough. This
nobleman repaired to Holland in the latter end of April;
and conferred with the States-General. Then he a&s;&s;em|bled
the army between Bor&s;chloen and Groe&s;-Waren, and
found it amounted to &s;eventy-four battalions of foot, and
one hundred and twenty-three &s;quadrons of hor&s;e and
dragoons, well &s;urni&s;hed with artillery and pontoons.
The court of France having received intelligence that
the Dani&s;h and Pru&s;&s;ian troops had not yet joined the
con&s;ederates, ordered the Elector of Bavaria and the Marc|&s;chal
de Villeroy to attack them before the junction could
be effected. In pur&s;uance of this order they pa&s;&s;ed the
Deule on the nineteenth day of May, and po&s;ted them&s;elves
<PB N="76" REF="80">
at Tirlemont, being &s;uperior in number to the allied army.
There they were joined by the hor&s;e of the army, com|manded
by the Mare&s;chal Mar&s;in, and encamped between
Tirlemont and Judoigne. On Whit&s;unday, early in the
morning, the Duke of Marlborough advanced with his
army in eight columns towards the village of Ramillies,
being by this time joined by the Danes; and he learned
that the enemy were in march to give him battale. Next
day the French generals perceiving the confederates &s;o near
them, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;trong camp, their right extend|ing
to the Tomb of Hauntemont, on the &s;ide of the Me|haigne;
their left to Anderkirk; and the village of
Ramillies being near their centre. The confederate army
was drawn up in order of battle, with the right wing near
Foltz on the brook of Yau&s;e, and the left by the village
of Franquenies, which the enemy had occupied. The
Duke ordered Lieutenant-General Schultz, with twelve
battalions and twenty pieces of cannon, to begin the action,
by attacking Ramillies, which was &s;trongly fortified with
artillery. At the &s;ame time Velt-Mare&s;chal D'Auverquer|que,
on the left, commanded Colonel Wertmuller, with
four battalions and two pieces of cannon, to di&s;lodge the
enemy's infantry po&s;ted among the hedges of Franquenies.
Both the&s;e orders were &s;ucce&s;sfully executed. The Dutch
and Dani&s;h hor&s;e of the left wing charged with great vi|gour
and intrepidity, but were &s;o roughly handled by the
troops of the French King's hou&s;ehold, that they began
to give way, when the Duke of Marlborough &s;u&s;tained
them with the body of re&s;erve, and twenty &s;quadrons
drawn from the right, where a mora&s;s prevented them
from acting. In the mean time, he in per&s;on rallied &s;ome
of the broken &s;quadrons, in order to renew the charge,
when his own hor&s;e falling, he was &s;urrounded by the
enemy, and mu&s;t have been either killed or taken pri|&s;oner,
had not a body of infantry come &s;ea&s;onably to his
relief. When he remounted his hor&s;e, the head of Colonel
Brien&s;ield, his gentleman of the hor&s;e, was carried off by a
cannon-ball while he held the Duke's &s;tirrup. Before the
<PB N="77" REF="81">
re-enforcement arrived, the be&s;t part of the French mou&s;|quetaires
were cut in pieces. All the troops po&s;ted in Ra|millies
were either killed or taken. The re&s;t of the ene|my's
infantry began to retreat in tolerable order, under
cover of the cavalry on their left wing, which formed
them&s;elves in three lines between O&s;&s;uz and Anderkirk:
but the Engli&s;h hor&s;e having found means to pa&s;s the
rivulet which divided them from the enemy, fell upon them
with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, that they abandoned their foot,
and were terribly &s;laughtered in the village of Anderkirk.
They now gave way on all &s;ides. The hor&s;e fled three
different ways: but were &s;o clo&s;ely pur&s;ued, that very
few e&s;caped. The Elector of Bavaria and the Mare&s;chal
de Villeroy &s;aved them&s;elves with the utmo&s;t difficulty.
Several waggons of the enemy's van-guard breaking down
in a narrow pa&s;s, ob&s;tructed the way in &s;uch a manner,
that the baggage and artillery could not proceed; nor
could their troops defile in order. The victorious hor&s;e
being informed of this accident, pre&s;&s;ed on them &s;o vigo|rou&s;ly,
that great numbers threw down their arms and
&s;ubmitted. The pur&s;uit was followed through Judoigne
till two o'clock in the morning, five leagues from the field
of battle, and within two of Louvaine. In a word, the
confederates obtained a complete victory. They took the
enemy's baggage and artillery, about one hundred and
twenty colours, or &s;tandards, &s;ix hundred officers, &s;ix
thou&s;and private &s;oldiers; and about eight thou&s;and were
killed or wounded.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The French impute the lo&s;s of this battle to the mi&s;conduct of Villeroy, who, it mu&s;t be owned, made a mo&s;t wretched di&s;po&s;ition. When he re|turned to Ver&s;ailles, where he expected to meet with nothing but reproaches, Louis received him without the lea&s;t mark of di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;aying, &startq;Mr. Mare&s;chal, you and I are too old to be fortunate.&endq;</NOTE> Prince Maximilian and Prince
Monba&s;on lo&s;t their lives: the Major-Generals Palavicini
and Mezieres were taken, together with the Marqui&s;&s;es
de Bar, de Nonant, and de la Baume, this la&s;t the &s;on
of the Mare&s;chal de Tallard, Mon&s;ieur de Montmorency,
nephew to the Duke of Luxembourg, and many other
per&s;ons of di&s;tinction. The lo&s;s of the allies did not exceed
<PB N="78" REF="82">
three thou&s;and men, including Prince Louis of He&s;&s;e, and
Mr. Bentick, who were &s;lain in the engagement. The
French generals retired with precipitation to Bru&s;&s;els,
while the allies took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Louvaine, and next day
encamped at Bethlem. The battle of Ramillies was at|tended
with the immediate conque&s;t of all Brabant. The
cities of Louvaine, Mechlin, Bru&s;&s;els, Antwerp, Ghent,
and Bruges &s;ubmitted without re&s;i&s;tance, and acknow|ledged
King Charles. O&s;tend, though &s;ecured by a &s;trong
garri&s;on, was &s;urrendered after a &s;iege of ten days. Me|nin,
e&s;teemed the mo&s;t fini&s;hed fortification in the Ne|therlands,
and guarded by &s;ix thou&s;and men, met with the
&s;ame fate. The garri&s;on of Dendermonde &s;urrendered
them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war; and Aeth &s;ubmitted on the &s;ame
conditions. The French troops were di&s;pirited. The
city of Paris was overwhelmed with con&s;ternation. Louis
affected to bear his misfortunes with calmne&s;s and com|po&s;ure:
but the con&s;traint had &s;uch an effect upon his
con&s;titution, that his phy&s;icians thought it nece&s;&s;ary to pre|&s;cribe
frequent bleeding, which he accordingly underwent.
At his court no mention was made of military tran&s;actions:
all was &s;olemn, &s;ilent and re&s;erved.</P>
<P>&sect; II. Had the i&s;&s;ue of the campaign in Catalonia been
&s;uch as the beginning &s;eemed to progno&s;ticate, the French
King might have in &s;ome mea&s;ure con&s;oled him&s;elf for his
di&s;graces in the Netherlands. On the &s;ixth day of April
King Philip, at the head of a numerous army, undertook
the &s;iege of Barcelona, while the Count de Tholou&s;e
blocked it up with a powerful &s;quadron. The inhabi|tants,
animated by the pre&s;ence of King Charles, made a
vigorous defence; and the garri&s;on was re-enforced with
&s;ome troops from Gironne and other places. But, after
the &s;ort of Montjuic was taken, the place was &s;o hard
pre&s;&s;ed, that Charles ran the utmo&s;t ri&s;que of falling into
the hands of the enemy; for the Earl of Peterborough,
who had marched from Valencia with two thou&s;and men,
&s;ound it impracticable to enter the city. Neverthele&s;s, he
maintained his po&s;t upon the hills; and, with &s;urpri&s;ing
<PB N="79" REF="83">
courage and activity, kept the be&s;iegers in continual alarm.
At length, Sir John Leake &s;ailed from Li&s;bon with thirty
&s;hips of the line; and on the eighth day of May arrived
in &s;ight of Barcelona. The French admiral no &s;ooner
received intelligence of his approach, than he &s;et &s;ail for
Toulon. In three days after his departure, King Philip
abandoned the &s;iege, and retired in great di&s;order, leaving
behind his tents, with the &s;ick and wounded. On the
&s;ide of Portugal the Duke of Berwick was left with &s;uch
an incon&s;iderable force as proved in&s;ufficient to defend the
frontiers. The Earl of Galway, with an army of twenty
thou&s;and men, undertook the &s;iege of Alcantara; and in
three days the garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;ting of four thou&s;and men,
were made pri&s;oners of war. Then he marched to Pla|centia,
and advanced as far the bridge of Almaras: but
the Portugue&s;e would penetrate no farther until they &s;hould
know the fate of Barcelona. When they under&s;tood the
&s;iege was rai&s;ed, they con&s;ented to proceed to Madrid,
Philip gue&s;&s;ing their intention, po&s;ted to that capital, and
&s;ent his Queen with all his valuable effects to Burgos,
whither he followed her in per&s;on, after having de&s;troyed
every thing that he could not carry away. About the latter
end of June the Earl of Galway entered the city without
re&s;i&s;tance: but the Spaniards were extremely mortified to
&s;ee an army of Portugue&s;e, headed by an heretick, in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of their capital. King Charles loitered away his
time in Barcelona, until his competitor recovered his &s;pirits,
and received &s;uch re-enforcements as enabled him to return
to Madrid, with an army equal to that commanded by
the Earl of Galway. This general made a motion to|wards
Arragon, in order to facilitate his conjunction with
Charles, who had &s;et out by the way of Sarago&s;&s;a, where
he was acknowledged as &s;overeign of Arragon and Valen|cia.
In the beginning of Augu&s;t this prince arrived at the
Portugue&s;e camp, with a &s;mall re-enforcement; and in
a few days was followed by the Earl of Peterborough, at
the head of &s;ive hundred dragoons. The two armies were
now pretty equal in point of number; but as each expected
<PB N="80" REF="84">
further re-enforcements, neither cho&s;e to hazard an en|gagement.
The Earl of Peterborough, who a&s;pired to
the chief command, and hated the Prince of Lichten&s;tein,
who enjoyed the confidence of King Charles, retired in
di&s;gu&s;t; and, embarking on board an Engli&s;h &s;hip of
war, &s;et &s;ail for Genoa. The Engli&s;h fleet continued all
the &s;ummer in the Mediterranean: they &s;ecured Cartha|gena,
which had declared for Charles: they took the town
of Alicant by a&s;&s;ault, and the ca&s;tle by capitulation. Then
&s;ailing out of the &s;traits, one &s;quadron was detached to
the We&s;t-Indies, another ordered to lie at Li&s;bon, and the
re&s;t were &s;ent home to England.</P>
<P>&sect; III. Fortune was not more propitious to the French
in Italy than in Flanders. The Duke de Vendome having
been recalled to a&s;&s;ume the command in Flanders after the
battle of Ramillies, the Duke of Orleans was placed at the
head of the army in Piedmont, under the tutorage and
direction of the Mare&s;chal de Mar&s;in. They were order|ed
to be&s;iege Turin, which was accordingly inve&s;ted in
the month of May; and the operations carried on till
the beginning of September. Great preparations had been
made for this &s;iege. It was not undertaken until the
Duke of Savoy had rejected all the offers of the French
monarch, which were &s;uffic$ent to have &s;haken a prince
of le&s;s courage and fortitude. The Duke de la Feuillade
having fini&s;hed the lines of circumvallation and contra|vallation,
&s;ent his quarter-ma&s;ter general with a trumpet,
to offer pa&s;&s;ports and a guard for the removal of the Du|che&s;s
and her children. The Duke of Savoy replied, that he
did not intend to remove his family, and that the Mare|&s;chal
might begin to execute his ma&s;ter's orders whenever
he &s;hould think fit: but, when the &s;iege began with un|common
fury, and the French fired red-hot balls into the
place, the two duche&s;&s;es, with the young prince and
prince&s;&s;es, quitted Turin, and retired to Quiera&s;co, from
whence they were conducted through many dangers into
the territories of Genoa. The Duke him&s;elf for&s;ook his
capital, in order to put him&s;elf at the head of his cavalry;
<PB N="81" REF="85">
and was pur&s;ued from place to place by five-and-forty
&s;quadrons, under the command of the Count D'Aubeterre.
Notwith&s;tanding the very noble defence which was made
by the garri&s;on of Turin, which de&s;troyed fourteen thou|&s;and
of the enemy during the cour&s;e of the &s;iege, the de|fences
were almo&s;t ruined, their ammunition began to fail,
and they had no pro&s;pect of relief but from Prince Eugene,
who had numberle&s;s difficulties to encounter before he could
march to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The Duke de Vendome, before
he left Italy, had &s;ecured all the fords of the Adige, the
Minicio, and the Oglio, and formed &s;uch lines and en|trechments
as he imagined would effectually hinder the
Imperial general from arriving in time to relieve the city
of Turin. But the Prince &s;urmounted all oppo&s;ition;
pa&s;&s;ed four great rivers in de&s;pite of the enemy; and reach|ed
the neighbourhood of Turin on the thirteenth day of
Augu&s;t. There being joined by the Duke of Savoy, he
pa&s;&s;ed the Po between Montcalier and Cavignan. On the
fifth day of September they took a convoy of eight hun|dred
loaded mules: next day they pa&s;&s;ed the Doria, and
encamped with the right on the bank of that river before
Piane&s;&s;a, and the left on the Stura before the Veneria.
The enemy were entrenched, having the Stura on their
right, the Doria on their left, and the convent of capu|chins,
called Notre Dame de la Campagne, in their centre.
When Prince Eugehe approached Turin, the Duke of
Orleans propo&s;ed to march out of the entrenchments, and
give him battle; and this propo&s;al was &s;econded by all the
general-officers, except Mar&s;in, who, finding the Duke
determined, produced an order from the French King,
commanding the Duke to follow the Mare&s;chal's advice.
The court of Ver&s;ailles was now become afraid of hazard|ing
an engagement again&s;t tho&s;e who had &s;o often de|feated
their armies; and this officer had private in&s;truc|tions
to keep within the trenches. On the &s;eventh day of
September the confederates marched up to the entrench|ments
of the French, in eight columns, through a terrible
fire from forty pieces of artillery, and were formed in order

of battle within half-cannon &s;hot of the enemy. Then
they advanced to the attack with &s;urpri&s;ing re&s;olution, and
met with &s;uch a warm reception as &s;eemed to &s;top their
progre&s;s. Prince Eugene perceiving this check, drew his
&s;word, and putting him&s;elf at the head of the battalions on
the left, forced the entrenchments at the fir&s;t charge.
The Duke of Savoy met with the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s in the cen|tre,
and on the right near Lucengo. The hor&s;e advanced
through the intervals of the foot, left for that purpo&s;e;
and breaking in with va&s;t impetuo&s;ity, completed the con|fu&s;ion
of the enemy, who were defeated on all hands, and
retired with precipitation to the other &s;ide of the Po, while
the Duke of Savoy entered his capital in triumph. The
Duke of Orleans exhibited repeated proofs of the mo&s;t
intrepid courage; and received &s;everal wounds in the en|gagement.
Mare&s;chal de Mar&s;in fell into the hands of
the victors, his thigh being &s;hattered with a ball, and died
in a few hours after the amputation. Of the French army
about five thou&s;and men were &s;lain on the field of battle:
a great number of officers, and upwards of &s;even thou&s;and
men were taken, together with two hundred and fifty-five
pieces of cannon, one hundred and eighty mortars, an in|credible
quantity of ammunition, all the tents and baggage,
five thou&s;and bea&s;ts of burthen, ten thou&s;and hor&s;es be|longing
to thirteen regiments of dragoons, and the mules
of the commi&s;&s;ary-general, &s;o richly laden, that this part
of the booty alone was valued at three millions of livres.
The lo&s;s of the confederates did not exceed three thou&s;and
men killed or di&s;abled in the action, be&s;ides about the
&s;ame number at the garri&s;on of Turin, which had fallen
&s;ince the beginning of the &s;iege. This was &s;uch a fatal
&s;troke to the intere&s;t of Louis, that Madame de Maintenon
would not venture to make him fully acquainted with the
&s;tate of his affairs. He was told that the Duke of Orleans
had rai&s;ed the &s;iege of Turin at the approach of Prince
Eugene; but he knew not that his own army was defeated
and ruined. The &s;pirits of the French were a little com|forted
in con&s;equence of an advantage gained about this
<PB N="83" REF="89">
time, by the Count de Medavi-grancey, who commanded
a body of troops left in the Mantuan territories. He
&s;urpri&s;ed the Prince of He&s;&s;e in the neighbourhood of
Ca&s;tiglione, and obliged him to retire to the Adige, with
the lo&s;s of two thou&s;and men: but this victory was at|tended
with no con&s;equence in their favour. The Duke
of Orleans retreated into Dauphin$e, while the French
garri&s;ons were driven out of every place they occupied in
Piedmont and Italy, except Cremona, Valenza, and the
ca&s;tle of Milan, which were blocked up by the confe|derates.</P>
<P>&sect; IV. Over and above the&s;e di&s;a&s;ters which the French
&s;u&s;tained in the cour&s;e of this campaign, they were mi&s;e|rably
alarmed by the project of an inva&s;ion from Britain,
formed by the Marquis de Gui&s;card, who, actuated by a
family di&s;gu&s;t, had abandoned his country, and become a
parti&s;an of the confederates. He was declared a lieute|nant-general
in the Emperor's army, and came over to
London, after having &s;ettled a corre&s;pondence with the
malcontents in the &s;outhern parts of France. He in&s;i|nuated
him&s;elf into the friend&s;hip of Henry St. John,
&s;ecretary of war, and other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction. His
&s;cheme of invading France was approved by the Briti&s;h
mini&s;try, and he was promoted to the command of a regi|ment
of dragoons de&s;tined for that &s;ervice. About eleven
thou&s;and men were embarked under the conduct of Earl
Rivers, with a large train of artillery; and the combined
&s;quadrons, commanded by Sir Cloude&s;ley Shovel, &s;et &s;ail
from Plymouth on the thirteenth day of Augu&s;t. Next
day they were forced into Torbay by contrary winds;
and there they held a council of war to concert their ope|rations,
when they di&s;covered that Gui&s;card's plan was
altogether chimerical, or at lea&s;t founded upon &s;uch &s;light
a&s;&s;urances and conjectures as could not ju&s;tify their pro|ceeding
to execution. An expre&s;s was immediately di&s;|patched
to the Admiralty, with the re&s;ult of this council;
and, in the mean time, letters arrived at court from the
Earl of Galway, after his retreat from Madrid to Valencia,
<PB N="84" REF="90">
&s;olliciting &s;uccours with the mo&s;t earne&s;t entreaties. The
expedition to France was immediately po&s;tponed; and
Sir Cloude&s;ley Shovel was ordered to make the be&s;t of his
way for Li&s;bon, there to take &s;uch mea&s;ures as the &s;tate
of the war in Spain &s;hould render nece&s;&s;ary. Gui&s;card
and his officers being &s;et on &s;hore, the fleet &s;ailed with the
fir&s;t fair wind, and towards the latter end of October ar|rived
at Li&s;bon. On the twenty-eighth day of the next
month the King of Portugal died, and his elde&s;t &s;on and
&s;ucce&s;&s;or being but eighteen years of age, was even more
than his father influenced by a mini&s;try which had private
connexions with the court of Ver&s;ailles. Neverthele&s;s,
Sir Cloude&s;ley Shovel and Earl Rivers, being pre&s;&s;ed by
letters from King Charles and the Earl of Galway, &s;ailed
to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the beginning of January; and on
the twenty-eighth arrived at Alicant, from whence the
Earl of Rivers proceeded by land to Valencia, in order to
a&s;&s;i&s;t at a general council of war. The operations of the
en&s;uing campaign being concerted, and the army joined
by the re-enforcement from England, Earl Rivers di&s;liking
the country, returned with the Admiral to Li&s;bon.</P>
<P>&sect; V. Poland was at length delivered from the pre&s;ence
of the King of Sweden, who in the beginning of Septem|ber
&s;uddenly marched though Lu&s;atia into Saxony; and
in a little time laid that whole electorate under contribu|tion.
Augu&s;tus being thus cut off from all re&s;ource,
re&s;olved to obtain peace on the Swede's own terms,
and engaged in a &s;ecret treaty for this purpo&s;e. In the
mean time the Poles and Mu&s;covites attacked the Swedi&s;h
forces at Kali&s;h in Great Poland; and by dint of numbers
routed them with great &s;laughter. Notwith&s;tanding this
event, Augu&s;tus ratified the treaty, by which he acknow|ledged
Stani&s;laus as true and rightful King of Poland, re|&s;erving
to him&s;elf no more than the empty title of &s;ove|reign.
The confederates were not a little alarmed to find
Charles in the heart of Germany; and the French court
did not fail to court his alliance: but he continued on the
re&s;erve again&s;t all their &s;ollicitations. Then they im|plored
<PB N="85" REF="91">
his mediation for a peace; and he an&s;wered, that he
would interpo&s;e his good offices, as &s;oon as he &s;hould know
they would be agreeable to the powers engaged in the
grand alliance.</P>
<P>&sect; VI. The pride of Louis was now humbled to &s;uch a
degree as might have excited the compa&s;&s;ion of his ene|mies.
He employed the Elector of Bavaria to write letters
in his name to the Duke of Marlborough and the deputies
of the States-General, containing propo&s;als for opening a
congre&s;s. He had already tampered with the Dutch, in a
memorial pre&s;ented by the Marquis d'Alegre. He like|wi&s;e
be&s;ought the Pope to interpo&s;e in his behalf. He
offered to cede either Spain and the We&s;t-Indies, or Milan,
Naples, and Sicily to King Charles; to give up a barrier
for the Dutch in the Netherlands; and to indemnify the
Duke of Savoy for the ravages that had been committed
in his dominions. Though his real aim was peace, yet
he did not de&s;pair of being able to excite &s;uch jealou&s;ies
among the confederates as might &s;hake the ba&s;is of their
union. His hope was not altogether di&s;appointed. The
court of Vienna was &s;o much alarmed at the offers he had
made, and the reports circulated by his emi&s;&s;aries, that
the Emperor re&s;olved to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Naples
before the allies &s;hould have it in their power to clo&s;e with
the propo&s;als of France. This was the true motive of his
concluding a treaty with Louis in the &s;ucceeding winter,
by which the Milane&s;e was entirely evacuated, and the
French King at liberty to employ tho&s;e troops in making
&s;trong efforts again&s;t the confederates in Spain and the
Netherlands. The Dutch were intoxicated with &s;ucce&s;s,
and their Pen&s;ionary, Hein&s;ius, entirely influenced by the
Duke of Marlborough, who found his account in the con|tinuance
of the war, which at once gratified his avarice
and ambition; for all his great qualities were ob&s;cured by
the &s;ordid pa&s;&s;ion of accumulating wealth. During the
whole war the allies never had &s;uch an opportunity as they
now enjoyed to bridle the power of France effectually,
and &s;ecure the liberties of the empire; and indeed, if their
<PB N="86" REF="92">
real de&s;ign was to e&s;tabli&s;h an equal balance between the
hou&s;es of Au&s;tria and Bourbon, it could not have been
better effected than by dividing the Spani&s;h monarchy
between the&s;e two potentates. The acce&s;&s;ion of Spain,
with all its appendages, to either, would have de&s;troyed
the equilibrium which the allies propo&s;ed to e&s;tabli&s;h.
But other motives contributed to a continuation of the
war. The powers of the confederacy were fired with the
ambition of making conque&s;ts; and England in particular
thought her&s;elf entitled to an indemnification for the im|men&s;e
&s;ums &s;he had expended. Animated by the&s;e con|curring
con&s;iderations, Queen Anne and the States-Ge|neral
rejected the offers of France; and declared, that they
would not enter into any negociation for peace, except in
concert with their allies.</P>
<P>&sect; VII. The Tories of England began to meditate
&s;chemes of oppo&s;ition again&s;t the Duke of Marlborough.
They looked upon him as a &s;elfi&s;h nobleman, who &s;acri|ficed
the intere&s;t of the nation, in protracting a ruinous
war for his own private advantage. They &s;aw their country
oppre&s;&s;ed with an increa&s;ing load of taxes, which they ap|prehended
would in a little time become an intolerable
burthen; and they did not doubt but at this period &s;uch
terms might be obtained as would fully an&s;wer the great
purpo&s;e of the confederacy. This, indeed, was the pre|vailing
opinion among all the &s;en&s;ible people of the nation
who were not particularly intere&s;ted in the pro&s;ecution of
the war, either by being connected with the General, or
in &s;ome &s;hape employed in the management of the finances.
The Tories were likewi&s;e in&s;tigated by a party-&s;pirit
again&s;t Marlborough, who, by means of his wife, was
in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Queen's confidence, and openly
patroni&s;ed the Whig faction. But the attention of people
in general was now turned upon the Scotti&s;h parliament,
which took into con&s;ideration the treaty of union lately
concluded between the commi&s;&s;ioners of both kingdoms.
On the third day of October, the Duke of Queen&s;berry, as
high-commi&s;&s;ioner, produced the Queen's letter, in which
<PB N="87" REF="93">
&s;he expre&s;&s;ed her hope, that the terms of the treaty would
be acceptable to her parliament of Scotland. She &s;aid, an
entire and perfect union would be the &s;olid foundation of a
la&s;ting peace; it would &s;ecure their religion, liberty, and
property, remove the animo&s;ities that prevailed among
them&s;elves, and the jealou&s;ies that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the
two nations; it would increa&s;e their &s;trength, riches, and
commerce; the whole i&s;land would be joined in affection,
and free from all apprehen&s;ion of different intere&s;ts; it
would be enabled to re&s;i&s;t all its enemies, &s;upport the pro|te&s;tant
intere&s;t every where, and maintain the liberties of
Europe. She renewed her a&s;&s;urance of maintaining the
government of their church; and told them, that now
they had an opportunity of taking &s;uch &s;teps as might be
nece&s;&s;ary for its &s;ecurity after the union. She demanded
the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies. She ob&s;erved, that the great &s;uc|ce&s;s
with which God Almighty had ble&s;&s;ed her arms af|forded
the nearer pro&s;pect of a happy peace, with which
they would enjoy the full advantages of this union; that
they had no rea&s;on to doubt but the parliament of England
would do all that &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary on their part to con|firm
the union; finally, &s;he recommended calmne&s;s and
unanimity in deliberating on this great and weighty affair,
of &s;uch con&s;equence to the whole i&s;land of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>&sect; VIII. Hitherto the articles of the union had been in|du&s;triou&s;ly
concealed from the knowledge of the people;
but the treaty being recited in parliament, and the parti|culars
divulged, &s;uch a &s;lame was kindled through the
whole nation, as had not appeared &s;ince the Re&s;toration.
The cavaliers or Jacobites had always fore&s;een that this
union would extingui&s;h all their hopes of a revolution in
favour of a pretender. The nobility found them&s;elves de|graded
in point of dignity and influence, by being ex|cluded
from their &s;eats in parliament. The trading part
of the nation beheld their commerce &s;addled with heavy
duties and re&s;trictions, and con&s;idered the privilege of
trading to the Engli&s;h-plantations as a precarious and un|certain
pro&s;pect of advantage. The barons or gentlemen
<PB N="88" REF="94">
were exa&s;perated at a coalition, by which their parliament
was annihilated, and their credit de&s;troyed. The people in
general exclaimed, that the dignity of their crown was
betrayed; that the independency of their nation had fallen
a &s;acrifice to treachery and corruption; that whatever
conditions might be &s;peciou&s;ly offered, they could not
expect they would be ob&s;erved by a parliament in which
the Engli&s;h had &s;uch a majority. They exaggerated the
dangers to which the con&s;titution of their church would
be expo&s;ed from a bench of bi&s;hops, and a parliament of
epi&s;copalians This con&s;ideration alarmed the pre&s;byte|rian
mini&s;ters to &s;uch a degree, that they employed all
their power and credit in waking the re&s;entment of their
hearers again&s;t the treaty, which produced an univer&s;al
ferment among all ranks of people. Even the mo&s;t rigid
puritans joined the cavaliers in expre&s;&s;ing their dete&s;tation
of the union; and, laying a&s;ide their mutual animo&s;ities,
promi&s;ed to co-operate in oppo&s;ing a mea&s;ure &s;o ignomi|nious
and prejudicial to their country. In parliament the
oppo&s;ition was headed by the Dukes of Hamilton and
Athol, and the Marquis of Annandale. The fir&s;t of
the&s;e noblemen had wavered &s;o much in his conduct, that
it is difficult to a&s;certain his real political principles. He
was generally &s;uppo&s;ed to favour the claim of the Pre|tender;
but he was afraid of embarking too far in his
cau&s;e, and avoided violent mea&s;ures in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of
this treaty, le&s;t he &s;hould incur the re&s;entment of the
Engli&s;h parliament, and forfeit the e&s;tate he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in
that kingdom. Athol was moe forward in his profe&s;&s;ions
of attachment to the court of St. Germain's; but he had
le&s;s ability, and his zeal was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been in|flamed
by re&s;entment again&s;t the mini&s;try. The debates
upon the different articles of the treaty were carried on
with great heat and vivacity; and many &s;hrewd arguments
were u&s;ed again&s;t this &s;cheme of an incorporating union.
One member affirmed, that it would furni&s;h a handle to
any a&s;piring prince to overthrow the liberties of all Bri|tain;
for if the parliament of Scotland could alter, or
<PB N="89" REF="95">
rather &s;ubvert its con&s;titution, this circum&s;tance might be
a precedent for the parliament of Great-Britain to a&s;&s;ume
the &s;ame power; that the repre&s;entatives for Scotland,
would, from their poverty, depend upon tho&s;e who po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
the means of corruption; and having expre&s;&s;ed &s;o
little concern for the &s;upport of their own con&s;titution,
would pay very little regard to that of any other. &startq;What!
(&s;aid the Duke of Hamilton) &s;hall we in half an hour
give up what our forefathers maintained with their
lives and fortunes for many ages? Are here none of the
de&s;cendants of tho&s;e worthy patriots, who defended the
liberty of their country again&s;t all invaders; who a&s;&s;i&s;ted
the great king Robert Bruce to re&s;tore the con&s;titution,
and revenge the fal&s;ehood of England, and the u&s;urpa|tion
of Baliol? Where are the Dougla&s;&s;es and Camp|bells?
Where are the peers, where are the barons,
once the bulwark of the nation? Shall we yield up the
&s;overeignty and independency of our country, when we
are commanded by tho&s;e we repre&s;ent to pre&s;erve the
&s;ame, and a&s;&s;ured of their a&s;&s;i&s;tance to &s;upport us?&endq;
The Duke of Athol prote&s;ted again&s;t an incorporating
union, as contrary to the honour, intere&s;t, fundamental
law, and con&s;titution of the kingdom of Scotland, the
birthright of the peers, the rights and privileges of the
barons and boroughs, and to the claim of right, property,
and liberty of the &s;ubjects. To this prote&s;t nineteen peers
and forty-&s;ix commoners adhered. The Earl Mari&s;chal
entered a prote&s;t, importing that no per&s;on being &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or
to the crown of England &s;hould inherit that of
Scotland, without &s;uch previous limitations as might &s;e|cure
the honour and &s;overeignty of the Scotti&s;h crown
and kingdom, the frequency and power of parliament, the
religion, liberty, and trade of the nation, from Engli&s;h
or any foreign influence. He was &s;econded by &s;ix-and-forty
members. With regard to the third article of the
union, &s;tipulating, that both kingdoms &s;hould be repre|&s;ented
by one and the &s;ame parliament, the country-party
ob&s;erved, that, by a&s;&s;enting to this expedient, they did in
<PB N="90" REF="96">
effect &s;ink their own con&s;titution, while that of England
underwent no alteration; that in all nations there are
fundamentals, which no power whatever can alter; that
the rights and privileges of parliament being one of the&s;e
fundamentals among the Scots, no parliament, or any
other power, could ever legally prohibit the meeting of
parliaments, or deprive any of the three e&s;tates of its right
of &s;itting or voting in parliament, or give up the rights
and privileges of parliament; but that by this treaty the
parliament of Scotland was entirely abrogated, its rights
and privileges &s;acrificed, and tho&s;e of the Engli&s;h parlia|ment
&s;ub&s;tituted in their place. They argued, that though
the legi&s;lative power in parliament was regulated and de|termined
by a majority of voices; yet the giving up the
con&s;titution, with the rights and privileges of the nation,
was not &s;ubject to &s;uffrage, being founded on dominion
and property; and therefore could not be legally &s;urren|dered
without the con&s;ent of every per&s;on who had a right
to elect and be repre&s;ented in parliament. They affirmed
that the obligation laid on the Scotti&s;h members to re&s;ide
&s;o long in London, in attendance on the Briti&s;h parliament,
would drain Scotland of all its money, impoveri&s;h the
members, and &s;ubject them to the temptation of being
corrupted. Another prote&s;t was entered by the Marquis
of Annandale again&s;t an incorporating union, as being
odious to the people, &s;ubver&s;ive of the con&s;titution, &s;ove|reignty,
and claim of right, and threatening ruin to the
church as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed. Fifty-two members joined in
this prote&s;tation. Almo&s;t every article produced the mo&s;t
inflammatory di&s;putes. The Lord Belhaven enumerated
the mi&s;chiefs which would attend the union, in a pa|thetick
&s;peech, that drew tears from the audience, and is
at this day looked upon as a prophecy by great part of the
Scotti&s;h nation. Addre&s;&s;es again&s;t the treaty, were pre|&s;ented
to parliament by the convention of boroughs, the
commi&s;&s;ioners of the general-a&s;&s;embly, the company trading
to Africa and the Indies, as well as from &s;everal &s;hires,
&s;tewartries, boroughs, towns, and pari&s;hes, in all the
<PB N="91" REF="97">
different parts of the kingdom, without di&s;tinction of Whig
or Tory, epi&s;copalian or pre&s;byterian. The Earl of Buchan
for the peers, Lockhart of Carnwath for the barons, Sir
Walter Stuart in behalf of the peers, barons, and boroughs;
the Earls of Errol and Mari&s;chal for them&s;elves, as high|con&s;table
and earl-mar&s;hal of the kingdom, prote&s;ted &s;eve|rally
again&s;t the treaty of union.</P>
<P>&sect; IX. While this oppo&s;ition raged within doors, the
re&s;entment of the people ro&s;e to tran&s;ports of fury and
revenge. The more rigid pre&s;byterians, known by the
name of Cameronians, cho&s;e officers, formed them&s;elves
into regiments, provided hor&s;es, arms, and ammunition,
and marching to Dumfries, burned the articles of the
union at the market-cro&s;s, ju&s;tifying their conduct in a
public declaration. They made a tender of their attach|ment
to Duke Hamilton, from whom they received en|couragement
in &s;ecret. They reconciled them&s;elves to
the epi&s;copalians and the cavaliers; they re&s;olved to
take the route to Edinburgh, and di&s;&s;olve the parliament;
while the Duke of Athol undertook to &s;ecure the pa&s;s
of Sterling with his Highlanders, &s;o as to open the com|munication
between the we&s;tern and northern parts of the
kingdom. Seven or eight thou&s;and men were actually
ready to appear in arms at the town of Hamilton, and
march directly to Edinburgh, under the Duke's command,
when that nobleman altered his opinion, and di&s;patched
private couriers through the whole country, requiring the
people to defer their meeting till further directions. The
more &s;anguine cavaliers accu&s;ed his grace of treachery;
but in all likelihood he was actuated by prudential motives.
He alledged, in his own excu&s;e, that the nation was not
in a condition to carry on &s;uch an enterpri&s;e, e&s;pecially
$s the Engli&s;h had already detached troops to the border,
and might in a few days have wafted over a con&s;iderable
$e-enforcement from Holland. During this commotion
among the Cameronians, the cities of Edinburgh and
$la&s;gow were filled with tumults. Sir Patrick John&s;ton,
rovo&s;t of Edinburgh, who had been one of the com|mi&s;&s;ioners
<PB N="92" REF="98">
for the union, was be&s;ieged in his own hou&s;e,
by the populace, and would have been torn in pieces, had
not the guards di&s;per&s;ed the multitude. The privy-coun|cil
i&s;&s;ued a proclamation again&s;t riots, commanding all
per&s;ons to retire from the &s;treets whenever the drum &s;hould
beat; ordering the guards to fire upon tho&s;e who &s;hould
di&s;obey this command, and indemnifying them from all
pro&s;ecution for maiming or &s;laying the lieges. The&s;e guards
were placed all round the hou&s;e in which the Peers and Com|mons
were a&s;&s;embled, and the council received the thanks
of the parliament, for having thus provided for their &s;afety.
Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e precautions of the government, the
commi&s;&s;ioner was con&s;tantly &s;aluted with the cur&s;es and
imprecations of the people as he pa&s;&s;ed along: his guards
were pelted; and &s;ome of his attendants wounded with
&s;tones as they &s;at by him in the coach, &s;o that he was
obliged to pa&s;s through the &s;treets in full gallop.</P>
<P>&sect; X. Again&s;t all this national fury, the Dukes of
Queen&s;berry and Argyle, the Earls of Montro&s;e, Seafield,
and Stair, and the other noblemen attached to the union,
acted with equal prudence and re&s;olution. They argued
&s;trenuou&s;ly again&s;t the objections that were &s;tarted in the
hou&s;e. They magnified the advantages that would accrue
to the kingdom from the privilege of trading to the Eng|li&s;h
plantations, and being protected in their commerce
by a powerful navy; as well as from the exclu&s;ion of a
popi&s;h pretender, who they knew was odious to the nation
in general. They found means, partly by their promi&s;es,
and partly by corruption, to bring over the Earls of Rox|burgh
and Marchmont, with the whole &s;quadron who
had hitherto been unpropitious to the court. They di&s;|armed
the re&s;entment of the clergy, by promoting an act
to be in&s;erted in the union, declaring the pre&s;byterian
di&s;cipline to be the only government of the church of
Scotland, unalterable in all &s;ucceeding times, and a fun|damental
article of the treaty. They &s;oothed the African
company with the pro&s;pect of being indemnified for the
lo&s;&s;es they had &s;u&s;tained. They amu&s;ed individuals with
<PB N="93" REF="99">
the hope of &s;haring the re&s;t of the equivalent. They em|ployed
emi&s;&s;aries to allay the ferment among the Came|ronians,
and di&s;unite them from the cavaliers, by canting,
praying, and demon&s;trating the ab&s;urdity, &s;infulne&s;s, and
danger of &s;uch a coalition. The&s;e remon&s;trances were
re-enforced by the &s;um of twenty thou&s;and pounds, which
the Queen privately lent to the Scotti&s;h trea&s;ury, and
which was now di&s;tributed by the mini&s;try in &s;uch a man|ner
as might be&s;t conduce to the &s;ucce&s;s of the treaty.
By the&s;e practices they dimini&s;hed, though they could not
&s;ilence the clamour of the people, and obtained a con|&s;iderable
majority in parliament, which out-voted all
oppo&s;ition. Not but that the Duke of Queen&s;berry at one
time de&s;paired of &s;uccceding, and being in continual ap|prehen&s;ion
for his life, expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of adjourning the
parliament, until by time and good management he &s;hould
be able to remove tho&s;e difficulties that then &s;eemed to be
in&s;urmountable. But the Lord-Trea&s;urer Godolphin, who
fore&s;aw that the mea&s;ure would be entirely lo&s;t by delay,
and was no judge of the difficulties, in&s;i&s;ted upon his pro|ceeding.
It was at this period that he remitted the money,
and gave directions for having forces ready at a call, both
in England and Ireland. At length the Scotti&s;h parliament
approved and ratified all the articles of the union, with
&s;ome &s;mall variation. Then they prepared an act for re|gulating
the election of the &s;ixteen peers and forty-five
commoners to repre&s;ent Scotland in the Briti&s;h parliament.
This being touched with the &s;ceptre, the three e&s;tates pro|ceeded
to elect their repre&s;entatives. The remaining part
of the &s;e&s;&s;ion was employed in making regulations con|cerning
the coin, in examining the accounts of their Afri|can
company, and providing for the due application of
the equivalent, which was &s;candalou&s;ly mi&s;applied. On
the twenty-fifth day of March the commi&s;&s;ioner adjourned
the parliament, after having in a &s;hort &s;peech taken notice
of the honour they had acquired in concluding an affair of
&s;uch importance to their country. Having thus accom|pli&s;hed
the great purpo&s;e of the court, he &s;et out for Lon|don,
<PB N="94" REF="100">
in the neighbourhood of which he was met by above
forty noblemen in their coaches, and about four hundred
gentlemen on hor&s;eback. Next day he waited upon the
Queen at Ken&s;ington, from whom he met with a very
gracious reception. Perhaps there is not another in&s;tance
upon record of a mini&s;try's having carried a point of this
importance again&s;t &s;uch a violent torrent of oppo&s;ition,
and contrary to the general &s;en&s;e and inclination of a whole
exa&s;perated people. The Scots were per&s;uaded that their
trade would be de&s;troyed, their nation oppre&s;&s;ed, and their
country ruined, in con&s;equence of the union with Eng|land;
and indeed their opinion was &s;upported by very plau|&s;ible
arguments. The majority of both nations believed
that the treaty would produce violent convul&s;ions, or at
be&s;t prove ineffectual. But we now &s;ee it has been at|tended
with none of the calamities that were progno&s;ti|cated;
that it quietly took effect, and fully an&s;wered all the
purpo&s;es for which it was intended. Hence we may learn,
that many great difficulties are &s;urmounted, becau&s;e they
are not &s;een by tho&s;e who direct the execution of any great
project; and that many &s;chemes which theory deems im|practicable,
will yet &s;ucceed in the experiment.</P>
<P>&sect; XI. The Engli&s;h parliament a&s;&s;embling on the third
day of December, the Queen, in her &s;peech to both Hou&s;es,
congratulated them on the glorious &s;ucce&s;&s;es of her arms.
She de&s;ired the Commons would grant &s;uch &s;upplies as
might enable her to improve the advantages of this &s;uc|ce&s;sful
campaign. She told them that the treaty of union,
as concluded by the commi&s;&s;ioners of both kingdoms,
was at that time under the con&s;ideration of the Scotti&s;h
parliament; and &s;he recommended di&s;patch in the publick
affairs, that both friends and enemies might be convinced
of the firmne&s;s and vigour of their proceedings. The par|liament
was perfectly well di&s;po&s;ed to comply with all her
Maje&s;ty's reque&s;ts. Warm addre&s;&s;es were pre&s;ented by
both Hou&s;es. Then they proceeded to the con&s;ideration
of the &s;upply, and having examined the e&s;timates in le&s;s
than a week, voted near &s;ix millions for the &s;ervice of the
<PB N="95" REF="101">
en&s;uing year.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. IX. 1706.</NOTE> Neverthele&s;s, in examining the accounts,
&s;ome objections aro&s;e. They found that the extraordinary
&s;upplies for the &s;upport of King Charles of Spain amount|ed
to eight hundred thou&s;and pounds more than the &s;ums
provided by parliament. Some members argued that very
ill con&s;equences might en&s;ue, if a mini&s;try could thus run
the nation in debt, and expect the parliament &s;hould pay
the money. The courtiers an&s;wered, that if any thing
had been rai&s;ed without nece&s;&s;ity, or ill-applied, it was rea|&s;onable
that tho&s;e who were in fault &s;hould be puni&s;hed;
but, as this expence was incurred to improve advantages,
at a time when the occa&s;ion could not be communicated to
parliament, the mini&s;try was rather to be applauded for
their zeal, than condemned for their liberality. The
que&s;tion being put, the majority voted that tho&s;e &s;ums had
been expended for the pre&s;ervation of the Duke of Savoy,
for the intere&s;t of King Charles again&s;t the common ene|my,
and for the &s;afety and honour of the nation. When
the Speaker pre&s;ented the money-bills, he told her, that
as the glorious victory obtained by the Duke of Marl|borough
at Ramillies was fought before it could be &s;up|po&s;ed
the armies were in the field, &s;o it was no le&s;s &s;ur|pri&s;ing
that the Commons had granted &s;upplies to her Ma|je&s;ty,
before the enemy could well know that the parlia|ment
was &s;itting.&mdash;The general was again honoured with
the thanks of both Hou&s;es. The Lords in an addre&s;s,
be&s;ought the Queen to &s;ettle his honours on his po&s;terity.
An act was pa&s;&s;ed for this purpo&s;e; and, in pur&s;uance of
another addre&s;s from the Commons, a pen&s;ion of five
thou&s;and pounds, out of the Po&s;t-Office, was &s;ettled upon
him and his de&s;cendants. The Lords and Commons
having adjourned them&s;elves to the la&s;t day of December,
the Queen clo&s;ed the year with triumphal proce&s;&s;ions.
As the &s;tandards and colours taken at Blenheim had been
placed in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, &s;o now tho&s;e that had been
brought from the field of Ramillies were put up in Guild|hall,
as trophies of that victory. About this time, the
Earls of Kent, Lind&s;ay, and King&s;ton were rai&s;ed to the
<PB N="96" REF="102">
rank of marqui&s;&s;es.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK I. 1706.</NOTE> The Lords Wharton, Poulet, Go|dolphin
and Cholmondeley were created earls. Lord Wal|den,
&s;on and heir apparent to the Earl of Suffolk, obtained
the title of Earl of Bindon; the Lord-Keeper Cowper and
Sir Thomas Pelham were ennobled as barons.</P>
<P>&sect; XII. The parliament being a&s;&s;embled after their &s;hort
rece&s;s, the Earl of Nottingham moved for an addre&s;s to
the Queen, de&s;iring her Maje&s;ty would order the proceed|ings
of the commi&s;&s;ioners for the union, as well as tho&s;e of
the Scotti&s;h parliament on the &s;aid &s;ubject, to be laid before
them. He was &s;econded by the Duke of Buckingham
and the Earl of Roche&s;ter; and an&s;wered by the Earl of
Godolphin, who told them they needed not doubt but that
her Maje&s;ty would communicate tho&s;e proceedings, as
&s;oon as the Scotti&s;h parliament &s;hould have di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the
&s;ubject of the union. The Lords Wharton, Somers,
and Hallifax ob&s;erved, that it was for the honour of
the nation that the treaty of union &s;hould fir&s;t come ratified
from the parliament of Scotland; and that then, and not be|fore,
it would be a proper time for the Lords to take it into
con&s;ideration. On the twenty-eighth day of January, the
Queen in per&s;on told both Hou&s;es, that the treaty of union,
with &s;ome additions and alterations, was ratified by an act of
the Scotti&s;h parliament: that &s;he had ordered it to be laid
before them; and hoped it would meet with their con|currence
and approbation. She de&s;ired the Commons
would provide for the payment of the equivalent, in ca&s;e
the treaty &s;hould be approved. She ob&s;erved to both
Hou&s;es, that now they had an opportunity of putting the
la&s;t hand to a happy union of the two kingdoms; and that
&s;he &s;hould look upon it as a particular happine&s;s, if this
great work, which had been &s;o often attempted without
&s;ucce&s;s, could be brought to perfection in her reign.
When the Commons formed them&s;elves into a committee
of the whole Hou&s;e, to deliberate on the articles of the
union, and the Scotti&s;h act of ratification, the Tory party,
which was very weak in that a&s;&s;embly, began to &s;tart &s;ome
objections. Sir John Packington di&s;approved of this in|corporating
<PB N="97" REF="103">
union, which he likened to a marriage with
a woman again&s;t her con&s;ent. He &s;aid it was an union
carried on by corruption and bribery within doors, by
force and violence without: that the promoters of it had
ba&s;ely betrayed their tru&s;t, in giving up their inde|pendent
con&s;titution, and he would leave it to the judg|ment
of the Hou&s;e, to con&s;ider whether or no men of
&s;uch principles were fit to be admitted into their Hou&s;e of
repre&s;entatives. He ob&s;erved, that her Maje&s;ty, by the
coronation-oath, was obliged to maintain the church of
England as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed; and likewi&s;e bound by the
&s;ame oath to defend the pre&s;byterian kirk of Scotland in
one and the &s;ame kingdom. Now (&s;aid he) after this union
is in force, who &s;hall admini&s;ter this oath to her Maje&s;ty?
It is not the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Scots, who are incapable of it,
and no well-wi&s;hers to the church of England. It is
then only the part of the bi&s;hops to do it; and can it
be &s;uppo&s;ed that tho&s;e reverend per&s;ons will, or can, act a
thing &s;o contrary to their own order and in&s;titution, as
thus to promote the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the pre&s;byterian
church-government in the united kingdom. He added
that the church of England being e&s;tabli&s;hed <HI>jure divino,</HI>
and the Scots pretending that the kirk was al&s;o <HI>jure divino,</HI>
he could not tell how two nations that cla&s;hed in &s;o e&s;&s;en|tial
an article could unite; he, therefore, thought it proper
to con&s;ult the convocation about this critical point. A
motion was made, that the fir&s;t article of the treaty,
which implies a peremptory agreement to an incorporating
union &s;hould be po&s;tponed; and that the Hou&s;e &s;hould
proceed to the con&s;ideration of the terms of the intended
union, contained in the other articles. This propo&s;al
being rejected, &s;ome Tory members quitted the Hou&s;e;
and all the articles were examined and approved without
further oppo&s;ition. The Whigs were &s;o eager in the pro|&s;ecution
of this point, that they proceeded in a very &s;uper|ficial
manner, and with &s;uch precipitation as furni&s;hed their
enemies with a plau&s;ible pretence to affirm that they had
<PB N="98" REF="104">
not con&s;idered the treaty with the coolne&s;s and deliberation
which an affair of this importance required.</P>
<P>&sect; XIII. Before the Lords began to inve&s;tigate the arti|cles
of the union, they, at the in&s;tance of the Archbi&s;hop
of Canterbury, brought in a bill for the &s;ecurity of the
church of England, to be in&s;erted as a fundamental and
e&s;&s;ential part of that treaty. It pa&s;&s;ed through both Hou&s;es
without oppo&s;ition, and received the royal a&s;&s;ent. On
the fifteenth day of February, the debates concerning the
union began in the Hou&s;e of Lords, the Queen being pre|&s;ent,
and the Bi&s;hop of Sarum chairman of the committee.
The Earls of Roche&s;ter, Angle&s;ey, and Nottingham ar|gued
again&s;t the union; as did the Bi&s;hop of Bath and
Wells. Lord Haver&s;ham, in a premeditated harangue,
&s;aid the que&s;tion was, Whether two nations independent
in their &s;overeignties, that had their di&s;tinct laws and
intere&s;ts, their different forms of wor&s;hip, church-go|vernment,
and order, &s;hould be united into one kingdom?
He &s;uppo&s;ed it an union made up of &s;o many mi&s;matched
pieces, of &s;uch jarring, incongruous ingredients, that
&s;hould it ever take effect, it would carry the nece&s;&s;ary
con&s;equence of a &s;tanding power and force, to keep them
from falling a&s;under and breaking in pieces every moment.
He repeated what had been &s;aid by Lord Bacon, that an
unity pieced up by direct admi&s;&s;ion of contrarieties in the
fundamental points of it, is like the toes of Nebuchad|nezzar's
image, which were made of iron and clay; they
may cleave together, but would never incorporate. He
di&s;&s;ented from the union for the &s;ake of the good old
Engli&s;h con&s;titution, in which he dreaded &s;ome alteration
from the additional weight of &s;ixty-one Scotti&s;h members,
and the&s;e too returned by a Scotti&s;h privy-council. He
took notice, that above one hundred Scotti&s;h peers, and
as many Commons, were excluded from &s;itting and voting
in parliament, though they had as much right of inheri|tance
to &s;it there, as any Engli&s;h peer had of &s;itting in the
parliament of England. He expre&s;&s;ed his apprehen&s;ion
of this precedent; and a&s;ked what &s;ecurity any peer of
<PB N="99" REF="105">
England had for his right and privilege of peerage, which
tho&s;e lords had not. He &s;aid, if the bi&s;hops would weak|en
their own cau&s;e, &s;o far as to give up the two great
points of epi&s;copal ordination and confirmation; if they
would approve and ratify the act for &s;ecuring the pre&s;by|terian
church-government in Scotland, as the true pro|te&s;tant
religion and purity of wor&s;hip; they mu&s;t give up
that which had been contended for between them and the
pre&s;byterians for thirty years, and been defended by the
greate&s;t and mo&s;t learned men in the church of England.
He objected to the exempting articles, by which heritable
offices and &s;uperiorities were re&s;erved. He affirmed that
the union was contrary to the &s;en&s;e of the Scotti&s;h nation;
that the murmurs of the people had been &s;o loud as to
fill the whole kingdom; and &s;o bold as to reach even to
the doors of the parliament; that the parliament it&s;elf
had &s;u&s;pended their beloved clau&s;e in the act of &s;ecurity
for arming the people; that the government had i&s;&s;ued
a proclamation, pardoning all &s;laughter, blood&s;hed, and
maiming, committed upon tho&s;e who &s;hould be found in
tumults. From the&s;e circum&s;tances he concluded, that
the Scotti&s;h nation was aver&s;e to an incorporating union,
which he looked upon as one of the mo&s;t dangerous ex|periments
to both nations. Lord North and Grey com|plained
of the &s;mall and unequal proportion of the land-tax
impo&s;ed upon Scotland. The Earl of Nottingham
&s;aid it was highly unrea&s;onable that the Scots, who were
by the treaty let into all the branches of the Engli&s;h trade,
and paid &s;o little towards the expen&s;e of the government,
&s;hould moreover have &s;uch a round &s;um by way of equi|valent.
The &s;ame topicks were in&s;i&s;ted upon by the Lords
North and Grey, Guern&s;ey, Granville, Stawell, and
Abingdon. The Earl of Nottingham, after having op|po&s;ed
every article &s;eparately, concluded with words to
his effect: &startq;As Sir John Maynard &s;aid to the late King
at the Revolution, that having buried all his cotempo|raries
in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, he was afraid, if his Ma|je&s;ty
had not come in that very juncture of time, he
<PB N="100" REF="106">
might have likewi&s;e outlived the very laws; &s;o, if this
union do pa&s;s, as I have no rea&s;on to doubt but it will,
I may ju&s;tly affirm I have outlived all the laws, and the
very con&s;titution of England; I, therefore, pray to God
to avert the dire effects which may probably en&s;ue from
&s;uch an incorporating union.&endq;</P>
<P>&sect; XIV. The&s;e arguments and objections were an&s;wered
by the Lord-Trea&s;urer Godolphin, the Earls of Sunder|land
and Wharton, the Lords Town&s;hend, Hallifax, and
Somers, the Bi&s;hops of Oxford, Norwich, and Sarum.
They ob&s;erved, that &s;uch an important mea&s;ure could not
be effected without &s;ome inconveniencies; but that the&s;e
ought to be born, in con&s;ideration of the greatne&s;s of the
advantage; that the chief dangers to which the church
was expo&s;ed aro&s;e from France and popery; and this
union would effectually &s;ecure it again&s;t the&s;e evils; that
Scotland lay on the weake&s;t &s;ide of England, which could
not be defended but by an expen&s;ive army. Should a war
break out between the two nations, and Scotland be con|quered,
yet even in that ca&s;e it would be nece&s;&s;ary to keep
it under with a &s;tanding army, which any enterpri&s;ing
prince might model for his ambitious purpo&s;es, and join|ing
with the Scots, en&s;lave his Engli&s;h dominions: that
any union after a conque&s;t would be compul&s;ive, con&s;e|quently
of &s;hort duration; whereas, now it was voluntary
it would be la&s;ting: that with regard to eccle&s;ia&s;tical
affairs, all heats and animo&s;ities might be allayed by &s;oft
and gentle management. The cantons of Switzerland,
though they profe&s;&s;ed different religions, were yet united
in one general body; and the diet of Germany was com|po&s;ed
of princes and &s;tates, among whom three different
per&s;ua&s;ions prevailed; &s;o that two &s;orts of di&s;cipline might
very well &s;ub&s;i&s;t under one legi&s;lature. If there was any
danger on either &s;ide, it threatened the Scots much more
than the Engli&s;h, as five hundred and thirteen members
would certainly be too hard for forty-five; and in the
Hou&s;e of Lords, &s;ix-and-twenty bi&s;hops would always
preponderate again&s;t &s;ixteen peers from Scotland. Not|with&s;tanding
<PB N="101" REF="107">
all the oppo&s;ition made by the lords of the
Tory intere&s;t, every article was approved by a great ma|jority,
though not without a good number of prote&s;ta|tions;
and a bill of ratification was prepared in the Lower
Hou&s;e by Sir Simon Harcourt, the &s;ollicitor-general, in
&s;uch an artful manner as to prevent all debates. All the
articles, as they pa&s;&s;ed in Scotland, were recited by way
of preamble, together with the acts made in both parlia|ments
for the &s;ecurity of their &s;everal churches;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet.</NOTE> and in
conclu&s;ion there was one clau&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Boyer.</NOTE> by which the whole was

&s;atisfaction. She &s;aid &s;he did not doubt but it would be
remembered and &s;poke of hereafter, to the honour of tho&s;e
who had been in&s;trumental in bringing it to &s;uch a happy
conclu&s;ion. She de&s;ired that her &s;ubjects of both king|doms
&s;hould from henceforward behave with all po&s;&s;ible
re&s;pect and kindne&s;s towards one another, that &s;o it might
appear to all the world they had hearts di&s;po&s;ed to become
one people.</P>
<P>&sect; XV.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1707.</NOTE> As the act of union did not take place till the
fir&s;t of May, a great number of traders in both kingdoms
re&s;olved to take advantage of this interval. The Engli&s;h
propo&s;ed to export into Scotland &s;uch commodities as en|titled
them to a drawback, with a view to bring them back
after the fir&s;t of May. The Scots, on the other hand,
as their duties were much lower than tho&s;e in England,
intended to import great quantities of wine, brandy, and
<PB N="102" REF="108">
other merchandize,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK I. 1707.</NOTE> which they could &s;ell at a greater ad|vantage
in England after the union, when there would be
a free intercour&s;e between the two nations. Some of the
mini&s;ters had embarked in this fraudulent de&s;ign, which
alarmed the merchants of England to &s;uch a degree, that
they pre&s;ented a remon&s;trance to the Commons. Re&s;olu|tions
were immediately taken in the Hou&s;e again&s;t the&s;e
practices, and a bill was prepared; but the Lords appre|hending
that it in &s;ome mea&s;ure infringed the articles of
the union, and that it might give umbrage to the Scotti&s;h
nation, it was dropped. The frauds had been in a good
mea&s;ure prevented by the previous re&s;olutions of the Hou&s;e;
and the fir&s;t day of May was now at hand; &s;o that the
bill was thought unnece&s;&s;ary. On the twenty-fourth day
of April the Queen prorogued the parliament, after having
given them to under&s;tand, that &s;he would continue by
proclamation the Lords and Commons already a&s;&s;embled,
as members in the fir&s;t Briti&s;h Parliament on the part of
England, pur&s;uant to the power ve&s;ted in her by the acts
of parliament of both kingdoms, ratifying the treaty of
union. The parliament was accordingly revived by pro|clamation,
and another i&s;&s;ued to convoke the fir&s;t parlia|ment
of Great-Britain for the twenty-third day of October.
The Scots repaired to London, where they were well re|ceived
by the Queen, who$ be&s;towed the title of duke on
the Earls of Roxburgh and Montro&s;e. She likewi&s;e
granted a commi&s;&s;ion for a new privy-council in that
kingdom, to be in force till the next &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament,
that the nation might not be di&s;gu&s;ted by too &s;udden an
alternation of outward appearances. The fir&s;t of May was
appointed as a day of publick thank&s;giving; and congra|tulatory
addre&s;&s;es were &s;ent up from all parts of England;
but the univer&s;ity of Oxford prepared no compliment; and
the Scots were wholly &s;ilent on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>&sect; XVI. In the cour&s;e of this &s;e&s;&s;ion the Commons, in
an addre&s;s to the Queen, de&s;ired &s;he would re&s;ettle the
i&s;lands of St. Chri&s;topher's and Nevis in the We&s;t-Indies,
which had been ravaged by the enemy. They likewi&s;e
<PB N="103" REF="109">
re&s;olved,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. IX. 1707.</NOTE> That an humble addre&s;s &s;hould be pre&s;ented to
her Maje&s;ty, praying &s;he would concert mea&s;ures for &s;up|pre&s;&s;ing
a body of pirates who had made a &s;ettlement on
the i&s;land of Madaga&s;car, as al&s;o for recovering and pre|&s;erving
the ancient po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, trade, and fi&s;hery in New|foundland.
The French refugees likewi&s;e delivered a re|mon&s;trance
to the Queen, recapitulating the benefits
which the per&s;ecuted prote&s;tants in France had reaped
from the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her royal progenitors, acknowledg|ing
their own happine&s;s in living under her gentle go|vernment,
among a people by whom they had been &s;o
kindly entertained when driven from their native country;
and imploring her Maje&s;ty's interpo&s;ition and good offices
in favour of their di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and per&s;ecuted brethren abroad.
She graciou&s;ly received this addre&s;s, declaring, &s;he had
always great compa&s;&s;ion for the unhappy circum&s;tances of
the prote&s;tants in France: that &s;he would communicate
her thoughts on this &s;ubject to her allies; and &s;he ex|pre&s;&s;ed
her hope that &s;uch mea&s;ures might be taken as
&s;hould effectually an&s;wer the intent of their petition. In
the month of May &s;he granted an audience to an amba&s;&s;a|dor
extraordinary from the Czar of Mu&s;covy, who deli|vered
a letter from his ma&s;ter, containing complaints of
King Augu&s;tus, who had maltreated the Ru&s;&s;ian troops
&s;ent to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, concluded a di&s;honourable peace
with Charles King of Sweden, without the knowledge of
his allies, and &s;urrendered Count Patkul, the Mu&s;covite
mini&s;ter, as a de&s;erter, to the Swedi&s;h monarch, contrary
to the law of nations, and even to the practice of barba|rians.
He, therefore, de&s;ired her Britannick Maje&s;ty would
u&s;e her good offices for the enlargement of the Count, and
the other Ru&s;&s;ian pri&s;oners detained at Stockholm; and
that &s;he would take into her protection the remains of the
Ru&s;&s;ian auxiliaries upon the Rhine, that they might either
enter into the &s;ervice of the allies, or be at liberty to return
in &s;afety to their own country. The Queen actually in|terpo&s;ed
in behalf of Patkul: but her interce&s;&s;ion proved
ineffectual, and that unhappy mini&s;ter was put to death
<PB N="104" REF="110">
with all the circum&s;tances of wanton barbarity. As many
&s;evere and &s;arca&s;tick writings had lately appeared, in which
the Whigs and mini&s;try were reviled, and reflexions hinted
to the prejudice of the Queen's per&s;on, the government
re&s;olved to make examples of the authors and publi&s;hers of
the&s;e licentious productions. Dr. Jo&s;eph Browne was
twice pillored for a copy of ver&s;es, intituled, &startq;The
country par&s;on's advice to the Lord-Keeper,&endq; and a
letter which he afterwards wrote to Mr. Secretary Harley.
William Stephens, rector of Sutton in Surrey, underwent
the &s;ame &s;entence, as author of a pamphlet, called, &startq;A
letter to the author of the memorial of the church of
England.&endq; Edward Ward was &s;ined and &s;et in the pil|lory,
for having written a burle&s;que poem on the times,
under the title of &startq;Hudibras redivivus;&endq; and the &s;ame
puni&s;hment was inflicted upon William Pittes, author of a
performance, intituled, &startq;The ca&s;e of the church of Eng|land's
memorial fairly &s;tated.&endq;</P>
<P>&sect; XVII. The Lower Hou&s;e of Convocation &s;till conti|nued
to wrangle with their &s;uperiors; and though they
joined the Upper Hou&s;e in a congratulatory addre&s;s to the
Queen on the &s;ucce&s;s of her arms, they re&s;olved to make
application to the Commons again&s;t the union. The
Queen being appri&s;ed of their de&s;ign, de&s;ired the Arch|bi&s;hop
to prorogue them for three weeks, before the expi|ration
of which the act of union had pa&s;&s;ed in parlia|ment.
The Lower Hou&s;e delivered a repre&s;entation to
the bi&s;hops, in which they affirmed, no &s;uch prorogation
had ever been ordered during the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament.
The bi&s;hops found in their records &s;even or eight prece|dents
of &s;uch prorogations, and above thirty in&s;tances of
the Convocation's having &s;at &s;ometimes before, and &s;ome|times
after a &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, nay, &s;ometimes even
when the parliament was di&s;&s;olved. The Queen, in|formed
of the&s;e proceedings, wrote a letter to the Arch|bi&s;hop,
intimating, that &s;he looked upon the Lower
Hou&s;e as guilty of an inva&s;ion of her royal &s;upremacy;
and that, if any thing of the &s;ame nature &s;hould be at|tempted
<PB N="105" REF="111">
for the future, &s;he would u&s;e &s;uch means for pu|ni&s;hing
offenders as the law warranted. The Prolocutor
ab&s;enting him&s;elf from the Convocation, the Archbi&s;hop
pronounced &s;entence of contumacy again&s;t him. The
Lower Hou&s;e in a prote&s;tation declared this &s;entence un|lawful
and altogether null. Neverthele&s;s, the Prolocutor
made a full &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, with which the Archbi&s;hop was
&s;atisfied, and the &s;entence was repealed. About this pe|riod
the Earl of Sunderland was appointed one of the
&s;ecretaries of &s;tate, in the room of Sir Charles Hedges.
This change was not effected without great oppo&s;ition
from Harley, who was in his heart an enemy to the Duke
of Marlborough, and all his adherents; and had already,
by his &s;ecret intrigues, made con&s;iderable progre&s;s in a
&s;cheme for &s;uper&s;eding the influence of the Duche&s;s.</P>
<P>&sect; XVIII. The French King at this juncture &s;eemed to
be entirely abandoned by his former good fortune. He
had &s;u&s;tained &s;uch a number of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive defeats as had
drained his kingdom of people; and his trea&s;ury was almo&s;t
exhau&s;ted. He endeavoured to &s;upport the credit of his
government by i&s;&s;uing mint-bills, in imitation of the
bank-notes of England: but, notwith&s;tanding all his pre|cautions,
they pa&s;&s;ed at a di&s;count of three-and-fifty per|cent.
The lands lay uncultivated: the manufactures.
could be no longer carried on; and the &s;ubjects peri&s;hed
with famine. The allies, on the other hand, &s;eemed to
pro&s;per in every quarter. They had become ma&s;ters of
the greate&s;t part of the Netherlands, in con&s;equence of
the victory at Ramillies: the army of King Charles was
con&s;iderably re-enforced: a &s;cheme was formed for the
conque&s;t of Toulon, by the troops of the Emperor and
the Duke of Savoy, &s;upplied with a large &s;um of money
by Queen Anne, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the combined &s;leets of
England and Holland, under the command of Sir
Cloude&s;ley Shovel. In a word, France &s;eemed to be re|duced
to the verge of de&s;truction, from which nothing in
all probability could have &s;aved her but the jealou&s;y and
mi&s;conduct of the con&s;ederates. Louis, by virtue of his
<PB N="106" REF="112">
capitulation with the Emperor in Italy, was enabled to
&s;end &s;uch re-enforcements into Spain, as turned the fortune
of the war in that country; while the di&s;tractions i$
the council of King Charles prevented that unanimity and
concurrence, without which no &s;ucce&s;s can be expected.
The Earl of Peterborough declared again&s;t an offen&s;ive
war, on account of the difficulty of finding &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in
Ca&s;tile; and advi&s;ed Charles to tru&s;t to the expedition
again&s;t Toulon. This opinion he &s;ent from Italy, to which
he had withdrawn.</P>
<P>&sect; XIX. Charles, however, was per&s;uaded to penetrate
once more to Madrid, and give battle to the enemy
wherever they &s;hould appear. On the thirteenth day of
March the army was a&s;&s;embled at Caudela, to the number
of &s;ixteen thou&s;and men, under the au&s;pices of the Mar|quis
das Minas, to whom the Earl of Galway was &s;econd
in command. They marched towards Yecla, and under|took
the &s;iege of Vilena; but, having received intelli|gence
that the Duke of Berwick was in the neighbour|hood,
they advanced on the fourteenth day of April in
four columns towards the town of Almanza, where the
enemy were drawn up in order of battle, their number
being con&s;iderably &s;uperior to that of the confederates.
The battle began about two in the afternoon, and the
whole front of each army was fully engaged. The Engli&s;h
and Dutch &s;quadrons on the left, &s;u&s;tained by the Portu|gue&s;e
hor&s;e of the &s;econd line, were overpowered after a
gallant re&s;i&s;tance. The centre, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of bat|talions
from Great-Britain and Holland, obliged the
enemy to give way, and drove their fir&s;t upon their &s;econd
line: but the Portugue&s;e cavalry on the right being
broken at the fir&s;t charge, their foot betook them&s;elves to
$$ight; &s;o that the Engli&s;h and Dutch troops being left
naked on the flanks, were &s;urrounded and attacked on
every &s;ide. In this dreadful emergency they formed them|&s;elves
into a &s;quare, and retired from the field of battle.
By this time the men were quite &s;pent with fatigue, and
all their ammunition exhau&s;ted: they were ignorant of
<PB N="107" REF="113">
the country, abandoned by their hor&s;e, de&s;titute of provi|&s;ion,
and cut off from all hope of &s;upply. Moved by
the&s;e di&s;mal con&s;iderations they capitulated, and &s;urren|dered
them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war, to the amount of
thirteen battalions. The Portugue&s;e, and part of the
Engli&s;h hor&s;e, with the infantry that guarded the baggage,
retreated to Alcira, where they were joined by the Earl of
Galway, with about five-and-twenty hundred dragoons
which he had brought from the field of battle. About
three thou&s;and men of the allied army were killed upon
the &s;pot, and among that number Brigadier Killigrew,
with many officers of di&s;tinction. The Earl of Galway,
who charged in per&s;on at the head of Gui&s;card's dragoons,
received two deep cuts in the face. The Marquis das
Minas was run through the arm, and &s;aw his concubine,
who fought in the habit of an Amazon, killed by his &s;ide:
the Lords Tyrawley, Mark Kerr, and Colonel Clayton,
were wounded: all their artillery, together with an hun|dred
and twenty colours and &s;tandards, and about ten
thou&s;and men, were taken; &s;o that no victory could be
more complete: yet it was not purcha&s;ed without the lo&s;s
of two thou&s;and men &s;lain in the action, including &s;ome
officers of eminence. The Duke of Berwick, who com|manded
the troops of King Philip, acquired a great addi|tion
of fame by his conduct and behaviour before and
during the engagement: but his authority was &s;uper&s;eded
by the Duke of Orleans, who arrived in the army imme|diately
after the battle. This prince &s;eemed to entertain
&s;ome private views of his own; for he took no effectual
&s;tep to improve the victory. He began a private negocia|tion
with the Earl of Galway, during which the two
armies lay inactive on the banks of the Cinca; and he
concluded the campaign with the &s;iege of Lerida, which
was &s;urrendered by capitulation on the &s;econd day of No|vember:
then the troops on both &s;ides went into winter-quarters.
The Earl of Galway and the Marquis das
Minas embarked at Barcelona for Li&s;bon, and General
Carpenter remained commander of the Engli&s;h forces
<PB N="108" REF="114">
quartered in Catalonia, which was now the only part of
Spain that remained to King Charles.</P>
<P>&sect; XX. The attempt upon Toulon by the Duke of
Savoy and Prince Eugene might have &s;ucceeded, if the
Emperor, notwith&s;tanding the repeated remon&s;trances of
the maritime powers, had not divided his army in Italy,
by detaching a con&s;iderable body through the eccle&s;ia&s;tical
&s;tate towards Naples, of which he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion without
any difficulty. Be&s;ides, ten thou&s;and recruits de&s;tined
for the Imperial forces in Italy were detained in Ger|many,
from an apprehen&s;ion of the King of Sweden,
who remained in Saxony, and &s;eemed to be upon very
indifferent terms with the Emperor. With the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
of the Engli&s;h and Dutch fleets the Duke of Savoy and
Prince Eugene pa&s;&s;ed the Var<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">This pa&s;&s;age was effected, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of the French who thought the works they had $ai&s;ed on that river were impregnable. The honour of the enterpri&s;e was in a great mea&s;ure owing to the gallantry of Sir John Norris and the Engli&s;h &s;eamen. That brave officer, embarking in boats with &s;ix hundred &s;ailors and mariners, entered the river, and were rowed within mu&s;ket &s;hot of the enemy's works, where they made &s;uch a vigorous and unexpected attack, that the French were immediately driven from part of their entrenchments: then Sir John landed with his men, clambered over the works that were deemed inacce&s;&s;ible, and attacking the defendants &s;word in hand, com$elled them to fly with the utmo&s;t precipita|tion. This detachment was &s;u&s;tained by Sir Cloude&s;ley Shovel in per&s;on. The Duke of Savoy, taking advantage of the enemy's con&s;ternation, pa&s;&s;ed the river almo&s;t without oppo&s;ition.</NOTE> on the eleventh day of
July, at the head of an army of thirty thou&s;and men, and
marched directly towards Toulon, whither the artillery
and ammunition were conveyed on board of the combined
&s;quadrons. The French King was extremely alarmed at
this attempt, as five thou&s;and pieces of cannon, va&s;t maga|zines,
and the be&s;t part of his fleet, were in the harbour
of Toulon, and ran the greate&s;t ri&s;que of being entirely
taken or de&s;troyed. The whole kingdom of France was
&s;illed with con&s;ternation, when they found their enemies
were in the bo&s;om of their country. The monarch re|&s;olved
to leave no &s;tone unturned for the relief of the place,
and his &s;ubjects exerted them&s;elves in a very extraordinary
<PB N="109" REF="115">
manner for its pre&s;ervation. The nobility of the adjacent
provinces armed their &s;ervants and tenants, at the head of
whom they marched into the city; they coined their
plate, and pawned their jewels for money to pay the
workmen employed upon the fortifications; and &s;uch in|du&s;try
was u&s;ed, that in a few days the town and harbour,
which had been greatly neglected, were put in a good
po&s;ture of defence. The allies took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the emi|nences
that commanded the city, and the ordnance being
landed, erected batteries. From the&s;e they began to can|nonade
and bombard the city, while the fleet attacked and
reduced two &s;orts at the entrance of the mole; and co|operated
in the &s;iege with their great guns and bomb|ketches.
The garri&s;on was numerous, and de&s;ended the
place with great vigour. They &s;unk &s;hips in the entrance
to the mole; they kept up a prodigious fire from the ram|parts;
they made de&s;perate &s;allies, and even drove the
be&s;iegers from one of their po&s;ts with great &s;laughter.
The French King, alarmed at this de&s;ign of his enemies,
ordered troops to march towards Toulon from all parts of
his dominions. He countermanded the forces that were
on their route to improve the victory of Almanza; a great
part of the army under Villars on the Rhine was detached
to Provence, and the court of Ver&s;ailles declared, that
the Duke of Burgundy &s;hould march at the head of a
&s;trong army to the relief of Toulon. The Duke of Savoy
being appri&s;ed of the&s;e preparations, &s;eeing no hope of
reducing the place, and being apprehen&s;ive that his pa&s;&s;age
would be intercepted, re&s;olved to abandon his enterpri&s;e.
The artillery being re-embarked, with the &s;ick and
wounded, he decamped in the night, under favour of a
terrible bombardment and cannonading from the Engli&s;h
&s;leet, and retreated to his own country without mole&s;ta|tion.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Had the Duke of Savoy marched with expedition from the Var, he would have found Toulon defencele&s;s: but he lingered in &s;uch a manner as gives rea&s;on to believe he was not hearty in the enterpri&s;e; and his opera|tions were reta$ded by a difference between him and his kinsman Prince Eugene.</NOTE>.
Then he undertook the reduction of Suza, the
<PB N="110" REF="116">
garri&s;on of which &s;urrendered at di&s;cretion. By this con|que&s;t
he not only &s;ecured the key to his own dominions,
but al&s;o opened to him&s;elf a free pa&s;&s;age into Dauphin&eacute;.</P>
<P>&sect; XXI. Sir Cloude&s;ley Shovel having left a &s;quadron
with Sir Thomas Dilkes for the Mediterranean &s;ervice,
&s;et &s;ail for England with the re&s;t of the fleet, and was in
&s;oundings on the twenty-&s;econd day of October. About
eight o'clock at night his own &s;hip, the A&s;&s;ociation,
&s;truck upon the rocks of Scilly, and peri&s;hed with every
per&s;on on board. This was likewi&s;e the fate of the Eagle
and the Romney; the Fire-brand was da&s;hed in pieces on
the rocks; but the captain and four-and-twenty men
&s;aved them&s;elves in the boat; the Phoenix was driven on
&s;hore; the Royal Anne was &s;aved by the pre&s;ence of mind
and uncommon dexterity of Sir George Byng and his
officers; the St. George, commanded by Lord Dur&s;ley,
&s;truck upon the rocks, but a wave &s;et her a-float again.
The admiral's body being ca&s;t a-&s;hore was &s;tripped and
buried in the &s;and; but afterwards di&s;covered and brought
into Plymouth, from whence it was conveyed to the London,
and interred in We&s;tmin&s;ter-abbey. Sir Cloude&s;ley Shovel
was born of mean parentage in the county of Suffolk; but
rai&s;ed him&s;elf to the chief command at &s;ea, by his indu&s;try,
valour, &s;kill, and integrity. On the Upper Rhine the
Allies were unpro&s;perous<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In the month of May three &s;hips of the line, namely the Royal Oak, of &s;eventy-&s;ix guns, commanded by Commodore Baron Wylde; the Grafton, of &s;eventy-guns, Captain Edward Action; and the Hampton-Court, of &s;eventy guns, Captain George Clements, &s;ailed as convoy to the We&s;t-India and Portugal &s;leet of merchant &s;hips, amounting to five-and-fifty &s;ail. They fell in with the Dunkirl$ &s;quadron, con&s;i&s;ting of ten &s;hips of war, one frigate, and four privateers, under the command of M. de Forbin. A furious action immediately en&s;ued, and notwith&s;tanding the va&s;t di&s;proportion in point of number, was maintained by the Engli&s;h Commodore with great gallantry, unti$l Captain Action was killed, Captain Clements mortally wounded, and the Grafton and Hampton. Court were taken, after having &s;unk the Sali&s;bury, at that time in the hands of the French: then the Commodore, having eleven feet water in his hold, di&s;engaged him&s;elf from the enemy, by whom he had been &s;urrounded, and ran his &s;hip aground near Dungene&s;&s;e; but &s;he afterwards floated, and he brought her &s;afe into the Downs. In the mean time the French frigate and privateers made prize of twenty-one Engli&s;h merchant-&s;hips of great value, which, with the Grafton and Hampton-Court, Forbin conveyed in triumph to Dunkirk. In July the &s;ame active officer took fifteen &s;hips belonging to the Ru&s;&s;ia company, off the coa&s;t of Lapland. In September he joined another &s;qua|dron fitted out at Bre&s;t, under the command of the celebrated M. de Guai Trooin, and the&s;e attacked, off the Lizard, the convoy of the Portugal fleet, con&s;i&s;ting of the Cumberland, Captain Richard Edwards, of eighty guns; the Devon&s;hire, of eighty; the Royal Oak, of &s;eventy-&s;ix; the Che&s;ter and Ruby, of fifty guns each. Though the French &s;quadron did not fall &s;hort of twelve &s;ail of the line, the Engli&s;h Captains maintained the action for many hours with &s;urpri&s;ing valour. At length the Devon&s;hire was obliged to yield to &s;uperior numbers&punc; the Cumberland blew up; the Che&s;ter and Ruhy were taken; the Royal Oak fought her way through the mid&s;t of her enemies, and arrived &s;afe in the harbour of Kin&s;ale; and the Li&s;bon fleet &s;aved them&s;elves, by making the be&s;t of their way during the engagement. Since the battle off Malaga the French King had never dared to keep the &s;ea with a largefleet, but carried on a kind of piratical war of this &s;ort, in order to di&s;tre&s;s the trade of England. He was the more encouraged to pur&s;ue the&s;e mea&s;ures, by the corre&s;pondence which his mini&s;ters carried on with &s;ome wretches belonging to the Admiralty, and other offices, who ba&s;ely betrayed their country in tran&s;mitting to France &s;uch intelligence concerning the convoys appointed for the protection of commerce, as enabled the enemy to attack them at advantage. In the cour&s;e of this year the French fi&s;hery, &s;tages, &s;hips, and ve&s;&s;els in Newfoundland were taken, burned, and de&s;troyed, by Captain John Underdown, of the Falleland.</NOTE>. The Prince of Baden was

could not defend the lines of Buhl again&s;t the Mare&s;chal
de Villars, who broke through this work, e&s;teemed the
rampart of Germany, reduced Ra&s;tadt, defeated a body
of hor&s;e, laid the duchy of Wirtemberg under contri|bution,
took Stutgard and Schorndorf; and routed three
thou&s;and Germans entrenched at Lorch, under the com|mand
of General Janus, who was made pri&s;oner. In all
probability, this active officer would have made great pro|gre&s;s
towards the re&s;toration of the Elector of Bavaria,
had not he been obliged to &s;top in the middle of his career,
in con&s;equence of his army's being dimini&s;hed by &s;ending
off detachments to Provence. The Imperial army retired
towards Hailbron, and the command of it was, at the
reque&s;t of the Emperor and allies, a&s;&s;umed by the Elector
of Hanover, who re&s;tored military di&s;cipline, and acted
with uncommon prudence and circum&s;pection; but he

had not force &s;ufficient to undertake any enterpri&s;e of im$portance.</P>
<P>&sect; XXII. In the month of April the Duke of Marlbo
rough &s;et out from the Hague for Leip&s;ick with a lette
from the Queen to Charles XII. of Sweden, who&s;e de&s;ign
were &s;till &s;o my&s;terious, that the confederates could no
help being alarmed at his being in the heart of Germany.
The Duke was pitched upon as the mo&s;t proper amba&s;&s;a|dor,
to &s;oothe his vanity and penetrate into his real in|tention<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">When the Duke arrived in his coach at the quarters of Count Piper, of whom he had demanded an audience, he was given to under&s;tand that the Count was bu&s;y, and obliged to wait half an hour before the Swedi&s;h mini&s;ter came down to receive him. When he appeared at la&s;t, the Duke alighted from his coach, put on his hat, pa&s;&s;ed the Count without &s;aluting him, and went a&s;ide to the wall, where having &s;taid &s;ome time, he returned and acco&s;ted him with the mo&s;t polite addre&s;s.</NOTE>. He found this original character, not &s;imple,
but forbid in his appearance and oeconomy, &s;avage in his
deportment, ferocious, illiterate, &s;tubborn, implacable,
and re&s;erved. The Engli&s;h general a&s;&s;ailed him on the
&s;ide of his vanity, the only part by which he was acce&s;&s;i|ble.
&startq;Sire (&s;aid he) I pre&s;ent to your Maje&s;ty a letter,
not from the Chancery, but from the heart of the
Queen my mi&s;tre&s;s, and written with her own hand.
Had not her &s;ex prevented her from taking &s;o long a
journey, &s;he would have cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea to &s;ee a prince
admired by the whole univer&s;e. I e&s;teem my&s;elf happy
in having the honour of a&s;&s;uring your Maje&s;ty of my
regard; and I &s;hould think it a great happine&s;s, if my
affairs would allow me to learn under &s;o great a general
as your Maje&s;ty, what I want to know in the art of
war.&endq; Charles was plea&s;ed with this over&s;trained
compliment, which &s;eems to have been calculated for a
raw, unintelligent barbarian, unacquainted with the
characters of mankind. He profe&s;&s;ed particular venera|tion
for Queen Anne, as well for the per&s;on of her
amba&s;&s;ador, and declared he would take no &s;teps to the
prejudice of the grand alliance. Neverthele&s;s, the &s;ince|rity
of this declaration has been que&s;tioned. The French
<PB N="113" REF="119">
court is &s;aid to have gained over his mini&s;ter, Count Piper,
to their intere&s;t. Certain it is, he indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;ought
occa&s;ion to quarrel with the Emperor, and treated him
with great in&s;olence, until he &s;ubmitted to all his de|mands.
The treaty being concluded upon the terms he
thought proper to impo&s;e, he had no longer the lea&s;t
&s;hadow of pretence to continue his di&s;putes with the court
of Vienna; and therefore began his march for Poland,
which was by this time over-run by the Czar of Mu&s;covy.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIII. The Duke of Marlborough returning from
Saxony, a&s;&s;embled the allied army at Anderlach near
Bru&s;&s;els, about the middle of May; and, under&s;tanding
that the Elector of Bavaria and the Duke de Vendome,
who commanded the French forces, had quitted their
lines, he advanced to Soignes, with a de&s;ign to engage
them in the plain of Fleurus. But receiving certain in|telligence,
that the enemy were greatly &s;uperior to the
allies in number, by the help of drafts from all their gar|ri&s;ons,
he retreated towards Bru&s;&s;els, and took po&s;t at
Mildert; while the French advanced to Gemblours.
Both armies lay inactive until the enemy &s;ent off a large
detachment towards Provence. Then the Duke of Marl|borough
and General D'Auverquerque re&s;olved to attack
them in their fortified camp at Gemblours. But they re|treated
with &s;uch celerity from one po&s;t to another, that
the confederates could not come up with them until they
were &s;afely encamped with their right at Pont-a-Tre&s;in,
and their left under the cannon of Li&s;le, covered with the
river Schelde, and &s;ecured by entrenchments. The allies
cho&s;e their camp at Helchin, and foraged under the
cannon of Tournay, within a league of the enemy; but
nothing could induce them to hazard an engagement; and
both armies went into winter-quarters in the latter end of
October. The Duke of Marlborough &s;et out for Frankfort,
where he conferred with the Electors of Mentz, Hanover,
and Palatine, about the operations of the next campaign;
then he returned to the Hague, and having concerted the
<PB N="114" REF="120">
nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures with the deputies of the States-General,
embarked for England in the beginning of November.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIV. The Queen's private favour was now &s;hifted to
a new object. The Duche&s;s of Marlborough was &s;upplanted
by Mrs. Ma&s;ham, her own kin&s;woman, whom &s;he had re&s;|cued
from indigence and ob&s;curity. This favourite &s;uc|ceeded
to that a&s;cendancy over the mind of her &s;overeign
which the Duche&s;s had formerly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. She was more
humble, pliable, and obliging than her fir&s;t patrone&s;s,
who had played the tyrant, and thwarted the Queen in
&s;ome of her mo&s;t re&s;pected maxims. Her Maje&s;ty's pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
in favour of the Tories and high-church men
was no longer in&s;olently condemned, and violently op|po&s;ed.
The new confidante conformed to all her preju|dices,
and encouraged all her de&s;igns with a&s;&s;ent and ap|probation.
In political intrigues &s;he acted an a&s;&s;ociate, or
rather auxiliary, to Mr. Secretary Harley, who had in&s;i|nuated
him&s;elf into the Queen's good graces; and deter|mined
to &s;ap the credit of the Duke of Marlborough and
the Earl of Godolphin. His aim was to unite the Tory
intere&s;t, under his own au&s;pices, and expel the Whigs from
the advantages they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed under the government. His
chief coadjutor in this &s;cheme was Henry St. John, after|wards
Lord Bolingbroke, a man of warm imagination and
elegant ta&s;te, penetrating, eloquent, ambitious, and en|terpri&s;ing,
who&s;e talents were rather &s;pecious than &s;olid,
and who&s;e principles were loo&s;e and fluctuating. He was
at fir&s;t contented to act in an inferior capacity, &s;ub&s;er|vient
to the de&s;igns of the &s;ecretary; but, when he under|&s;tood
the full extent of his own parts and influence, he
was fired with the ambition of eclip&s;ing his principal, and
from the &s;phere of his mini&s;ter, rai&s;ed him&s;elf to the cha|racter
of his rival. The&s;e politicians, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
of Sir Simon Harcourt, a colleague of uncommon ability
and credit, exerted their endeavours to rally and reconcile
the di&s;united Tories, who were given to under&s;tand, that
the Queen could no longer bear the tyranny of the Whigs:
that &s;he had been always a friend in her heart to the
<PB N="115" REF="121">
Tory and high-church party; and that &s;he would now
exhibit manife&s;t proofs of her inclination. She accordingly
be&s;towed the bi&s;hopricks of Che&s;ter and Exeter upon Sir
William Dawes and Dr. Blackall, who, though otherwi&s;e
of unblemi&s;hed characters, had openly condemned the Re|volution.</P>
<P>&sect; XXV. The people in general began to be &s;ick of the
Whig mini&s;try, whom they had formerly care&s;&s;ed. To
them they imputed the burthens under which they groaned;
burthens which they had hitherto been animated to bear
by the pomp of triumph and uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;s. At
pre&s;ent they were di&s;couraged by the battle of Almanza,
the mi&s;carriage of the expedition again&s;t Toulon, the lo&s;s
of Sir Cloude&s;ley Shovel, and the fate of four &s;hips of the
line, de&s;troyed or taken by a &s;quadron under the command
of Me&s;&s;ieurs Forbin and Du Guai Trouin, two of the
mo&s;t enterpri&s;ing &s;ea-officers in the French &s;ervice. No
new advantage had been obtained in the Netherlands:
France, in&s;tead of &s;inking under the weight of the confe|deracy,
&s;eemed to ri&s;e with fre&s;h vigour from every over|throw;
the Engli&s;h traders had lately &s;u&s;tained repeated
lo&s;&s;es for want of proper convoys; the coin of the nation
was vi&s;ibly dimini&s;hed; and the publick credit began to
decline. The Tories did not fail to inculcate and exag|gerate
the&s;e cau&s;es of di&s;content, and the mini&s;try were
too remi&s;s in taking proper &s;teps for the &s;atisfaction of the
nation. In&s;tead of &s;oothing by gentle mea&s;ures, and equal
admini&s;tration, the Scots, who had expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch aver|&s;ion
to the union, they treated them in &s;uch a manner, as
&s;erved to exa&s;perate the &s;pirits of that people. A &s;top was
put to their whole commerce for two months before it was
diverted into the new channel. Three months elap&s;ed
before the equivalent was remitted to that kingdom, and
before the equivalent was remitted to that kingdom, and
it was afterwards applied with the mo&s;t &s;hameful partiality.
Seizures of wines and other merchandi&s;e imported from
thence into England were made in all the northern parts,
with an affectation of &s;everity and di&s;dain: &s;o that the
generality of the Scotti&s;h nation loudly exclaimed again&s;t
<PB N="116" REF="122">
the union and the government. The Jacobites were
again in commotion. They held conferences; they main|tained
a corre&s;pondence with the court of St. Germain's;
a great number of the mo&s;t rigid Whigs entered &s;o far
into their mea&s;ures, as to think a revolution was ab&s;o|lutely
nece&s;&s;ary to retrieve the liberties, independence,
and commerce of their country; the Pretender's birth|day
was publickly celebrated in many different parts of
the kingdom; and every thing &s;eemed to portend an uni|ver&s;al
revolt. Ireland continued quiet under the admini|&s;tration
of the Earl of Pembroke, whom the Queen had
appointed lord-lieutenant of that kingdom. A parliament
having met at Dublin in the month of July, pre&s;ented
addre&s;&s;es of congratulation to her Maje&s;ty on the late union
of the two kingdoms. The Commons having in&s;pected
the public accounts, re&s;olved, That the kingdom had
been put to exce&s;&s;ive charge, by means of great arrears of
rent returned by the late tru&s;tees, as due out of the for|feited
e&s;tates, which returns were fal&s;e and unju&s;t; and,
That an humble repre&s;entation &s;hould be laid before her
Maje&s;ty on this &s;ubject. They pa&s;&s;ed another laudable
re&s;olution in favour of their own manufactures. They
granted the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies, and having fini&s;hed &s;everal
bills for the royal a&s;&s;ent, were prorogued on the twenty-ninth
day of October.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVI. It was on the twenty-third of the &s;ame month
that the fir&s;t parliament of Great-Britain a&s;&s;embled at
We&s;tmin&s;ter, when the Queen in her &s;peech to both
Hou&s;es palliated the mi&s;carriages in Provence and in Spain;
repre&s;ented the nece&s;&s;ity of making further efforts again&s;t
the common enemy; and exhorted them to be upon their
guard again&s;t tho&s;e who endeavoured to &s;ow jealou&s;ies in
the common-wealth. The Commons, in their addre&s;s,
expre&s;&s;ed the continuance of their former zeal and devo|tion
to her Maje&s;ty's government; but, in the Hou&s;e of
Lords, the Earl of Wharton expatiated upon the &s;carcity
of money, the decay of trade, the mi&s;management of the
navy. He was &s;econded by Lord Somers, and the leaders
<PB N="117" REF="123">
of the Tory party, who propo&s;ed, that, previous to every
mea&s;ure, they &s;hould con&s;ider the &s;tate of the nation. The
de&s;ign of Wharton and Somers, was to rai&s;e the Earl of
Orford once more to the head of the Admiralty; and the
Tories, who did not perceive their dirft, hoped in the
cour&s;e of the enquiry to fix the blame of all mi&s;manage|ment
upon the Whig mini&s;ters. A day being fixed for
this examination, the Hou&s;e received a petition from the
&s;heriffs and merchants of London, complaining of great
lo&s;&s;es by &s;ea, for want of crui&s;ers and convoys; and the&s;e
complaints were proved by witne&s;&s;es. The report was
&s;ent to the Lord-Admiral, who an&s;wered all the articles
&s;eparately; then the Tories moved for an addre&s;s, in
which the blame of the mi&s;carriages might be laid upon
the mini&s;try and cabinet-council; but the motion was
over-ruled; the Queen was pre&s;ented with a bare repre|&s;entation
of the facts, and de&s;ired that &s;he would take the
proper mea&s;ures for preventing &s;uch evils for the future.
The Commons made &s;ome progre&s;s in an enquiry of the
&s;ame nature; and brought in a bill for the better &s;ecuring
the trade of the kingdom. They chearfully granted the
&s;upplies for the &s;ervice of the en&s;uing year. They pre|pared
another bill for repealing the Scotti&s;h act of &s;ecurity,
and that about peace and war, which had excited &s;uch
jealou&s;y in the Engli&s;h nation. They re&s;olved, That
there &s;hould be but one privy-council in the kingdom of
Great-Britain: That the militia of Scotland &s;hould be
put on the &s;ame footing with that of England: That the
powers of the ju&s;tices of the peace &s;hould be the &s;ame
through the whole i&s;land: That the lords of ju&s;ticiary
in Scotland &s;hould go circuits twice in the year: That
the writs for electing Scotti&s;h members to &s;erve in the
Hou&s;e of Commons &s;hould be directed, and returns made,
in the &s;ame manner as practi&s;ed in England. An act
being formed on the&s;e re&s;olutions, they brought in a bill
for pre&s;erving the trade with Portugal: then they con&s;i|dered
the &s;tate of the war in Spain.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="124">
&sect; XXVII. When the Queen pa&s;&s;ed the&s;e bills, &s;he re|commended
an augmentation in the aids and auxiliaries
granted to the King of Spain and the Duke of Savoy.
This intimation produced a debate in the Hou&s;e of Lords,
on the affairs of Spain. The &s;ervices of the Earl of Pe|terborough
were extolled by the Earls of Roche&s;ter and
Lord Haver&s;ham, who levelled &s;ome oblique reflexions at
the Earl of Galway. Several lords enlarged upon the
nece&s;&s;ity of carrying on the war until King Charles
&s;hould be fully e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the throne of Spain. The
Earl of Peterborough &s;aid they ought to contribute nine
&s;hillings in the pound rather than make peace on any
other terms: he declared him&s;elf ready to return to Spain,
and &s;erve even under the Earl of Galway. The Earl of
Roche&s;ter repeated a maxim of the old Duke of Schom|berg,
That attacking France in the Netherlands was
like taking a bull by the horns. He, therefore, propo&s;ed,
that the allies &s;hould &s;tand on the defen&s;ive in Flanders,
and detach from thence fifteen or twenty thou&s;and men
into Catalonia. He was &s;econded by the Earl of Not|tingham;
but warmly oppo&s;ed by the Duke of Marlbo|rough,
who urged, that the great towns in Brabant which
he had conquered could not be pre&s;erved without a con&s;i|derable
number of men; and that if the French &s;hould
gain any advantage in Flanders from their &s;uperiority in
point of number, the di&s;contented party in Holland,
which was very numerous, and bore with impatience the
burthen of the war, would not fail crying aloud for peace.
Being challenged by Roche&s;ter to &s;how how troops could
be procured for the &s;ervice of Italy and Spain, he a&s;&s;ured
the Hou&s;e, that mea&s;ures had been already concerted with
the Emperor, for forming an army of forty thou&s;and men
under the Duke of Savoy, and for &s;ending powerful &s;uc|cours
to King Charles. This declaration fini&s;hed the
debate, which i&s;&s;ued in an affectionate addre&s;s to her Ma|je&s;ty.
The Lords re&s;olved, That no peace could be &s;afe
and honourable for her Maje&s;ty and her allies, if Spain
and the Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indies were &s;uffered to continue in
<PB N="119" REF="125">
the power of the Hou&s;e of Bourbon. They pre&s;ented an
addre&s;s, in which they de&s;ired &s;he would pre&s;s the Em|peror
to &s;end powerful &s;uccours to Spain, under the com|mand
of Prince Eugene, with all po&s;&s;ible expedition, to
make good his contract with the Duke of Savoy, and
&s;trengthen the army on the Rhine, which was now hap|pily
put under the conduct of that wi&s;e and valiant prince,
the Elector of Hanover. The Commons concurred in this
remon&s;trance, in con&s;equence of which the Queen de&s;ired
the Emperor to be&s;tow the command in Spain upon
Prince Eugene. The court of Vienna, however, did
not comply with this reque&s;t; but &s;ent thither Count
Staremberg, who, of all the German generals, was next
to the Prince in military reputation. The Commons now
proceeded to con&s;ider of ways and means, and actually
e&s;tabli&s;hed funds for rai&s;ing the &s;upply, which amounted to
the enormous &s;um of &s;ix millions.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVIII. At this period Mr. Harley's character in|curred
&s;u&s;picion from the treachery of William Gregg,
an inferior clerk in his office, who was detected in a cor|re&s;pondence
with Mon&s;ieur Chamillard, the French King's
mini&s;ter. When his practices were detected, he made an
ample confe&s;&s;ion, and pleading guilty to his indictment at
the Old-Bailey, was condemned to death for high-trea&s;on.
At the &s;ame time, John Bara and Alexander Valiere
were committed to Newgate, for corre&s;ponding with the
enemy; and Claude Baud, &s;ecretary to the Duke of Savoy's
mini&s;ter, was, at the reque&s;t of his ma&s;ter, apprehended
for traiterous practices again&s;t her Maje&s;ty and her govern|ment.
A committee of &s;even lords being appointed to
examine the&s;e delinquents, made a report to the Hou&s;e,
which was communicated to the Queen, in an addre&s;s,
importing, that Gregg had di&s;covered &s;ecrets of &s;tate to
the French mini&s;ter: that Alexander Valiere and John
Bara had managed a corre&s;pondence with the governours
and commi&s;&s;aries of Calais and Boulogn; and, in all
probability, di&s;covered to the enemy the &s;tations of the
Briti&s;h crui&s;ers, the &s;trength of their convoys, and the
<PB N="120" REF="126">
times at which the merchant-&s;hips proceeded on their
voyages: that all the papers in the office of Mr. Secre|tary
Harley had been for a con&s;iderable time expo&s;ed to
the view of the meane&s;t clerks; and that the peru&s;al of all
the letters to and from the French pri&s;oners had been
chiefly tru&s;ted to Gregg, a per&s;on of a very &s;u&s;picious cha|racter,
and known to be extremely indigent. The Queen
granted a reprieve to this man, in hope of his making
&s;ome important di&s;covery: but he really knew nothing of
con&s;equence to the nation. He was an indigent Scot,
who had been employed as a &s;py in his own country, and
now offered his &s;ervices to Chamillard, with a view of
being rewarded for his treachery: but he was di&s;covered
before he had reaped any fruits from his corre&s;pondence.
As he had no &s;ecrets of importance to impart, he was
executed at Tyburn, where he delivered a paper to the
&s;heriff, in which he declared Mr. Harley entirely ignorant
of all his trea&s;onable connexions, notwith&s;tanding &s;ome
endeavours that were made to engage him in an accu&s;ation
of that mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIX. The Queen had refu&s;ed to admit the Earl of
Peterborough into her pre&s;ence, until he &s;hould have vindi|cated
his conduct, of which King Charles had complained
in divers letters. He was eagerly de&s;irous of a parlia|mentary
enquiry. His military proceedings, his negocia|tions,
his di&s;po&s;al of the remittances were taken into con|&s;ideration
by both Hou&s;es: but he produced &s;uch a num|ber
of witne&s;&s;es and original papers to ju&s;tify every tran&s;|action,
that his character triumphed in the enquiry, which
was dropped before it produced any re&s;olution in parlia|ment.
Then they took cognizance of the &s;tate of affairs
in Spain, and found there had been a great deficiency in
the Engli&s;h troops at the battle of Almanza. This, how|ever,
was explained &s;o much to their &s;atisfaction, that they
voted an addre&s;s to the Queen, thanking her for having
taken mea&s;ures to re&s;tore the affairs in Spain, and provide
foreign troops for that &s;ervice. The bill for rendering the
union more complete met with a vigorous oppo&s;ition in
<PB N="121" REF="127">
the Hou&s;e of Lords from the court-party, on account of
the clau&s;e enacting, That, after the fir&s;t of May, there
&s;hould be but one privy-council in the kingdom of Great|Britain.
The mini&s;try finding it was &s;trenuou&s;ly &s;upport|ed
by all the Tories, and a con&s;iderable number of the
other faction, would have compromi&s;ed the difference, by
propo&s;ing that the privy-council of Scotland &s;hould con|tinue
to the fir&s;t day of October. They hinted this ex|pedient,
in hope of being able to influence the en&s;uing elec|tions:
but their de&s;ign being palpable, the motion was
over-ruled, and the bill received the royal a&s;&s;ent: a court
of Exchequer, however, was erected in Scotland upon the
model of that in England. The execution of Gregg,
and the examination of Valiere and Bara, who had acted
as &s;mugglers to the coa&s;t of France, under the protection
of Harley, to whom they engaged for intelligence, affected
the credit of that mini&s;ter, who was reviled and traduced
by the emi&s;&s;aries of the Whig party. The Duke of Marl|borough
and the Earl Godolphin, being appri&s;ed of his
&s;ecret practices with Mrs. Ma&s;ham, wrote to the Queen,
that they could &s;erve her no longer, &s;hould Mr. Harley
continue in the po&s;t of &s;ecretary. Being &s;ummoned to the
cabinet-council, they waited on her in per&s;on, and ex|po&s;tulated
on the &s;ame &s;ubject. She endeavoured to ap|pea&s;e
their re&s;entment with &s;oft per&s;ua&s;ion, which had no
effect; and when they retired from court, to the a&s;toni&s;h|ment
of all the &s;pectators, &s;he repaired in per&s;on to the
council. There Mr. Secretary Harley began to explain
the cau&s;e of their meeting, which was &s;ome circum&s;tance
relating to foreign affairs. The Duke of Somer&s;et &s;aid
he did not &s;ee how they could deliberate on &s;uch matters
while the general and trea&s;urer were ab&s;ent: the other
members ob&s;erved a &s;ullen &s;ilence; &s;o that the coun|$il
broke up, and the Queen found her&s;elf in danger of
being abandoned by her mini&s;ters. Next day her Ma|je&s;ty
&s;ent for the Duke of Marlborough, and told him that
$arley &s;hould immediately re&s;ign his office, which was
$on&s;erred upon Mr. Henry Boyle, chancellor of the Ex|chequer:
<PB N="122" REF="128">
but &s;he deeply re&s;ented the deportment of the
Duke and the Earl of Godolphin, from whom &s;he en|tirely
withdrew her confidence. Sir Simon Harcourt, at|torney-general,
Sir Thomas Man&s;el, comptroller of the
hou&s;ehold, and Mr. St. John, relinqui&s;hed their &s;everal
po&s;ts upon the di&s;grace of Harley.</P>
<P>&sect; XXX. The kingdom was at this period alarmed with a
threatened inva&s;ion from France. The Court of St. Ger|main's
had &s;ent over one Colonel Hook with credentials to
Scotland, to learn the &s;ituation, number, and ability of the
Pretender's friends in that country. This mini&s;ter, by his
mi&s;conduct, produced a divi&s;ion among the Scotti&s;h Jaco|bites.
Being a creature of the Duke of Perth, he attached
him&s;elf wholly to the Duke of Athol, and tho&s;e other
zealous parti&s;ans who were bent upon receiving the Pre|tender
without conditions; and he neglected the Duke of
Hamilton, the Earl Mari&s;chal, and other adherents of that
hou&s;e, who adopted the more moderate principles avowed by
the Earl of Middleton. At his return to France, he made
&s;uch a favourable report of the di&s;po&s;ition and power of the
Scotti&s;h nation, that Louis re&s;olved to equip an armament,
and &s;end over the Pretender to that kingdom. His pretence
was to e&s;tabli&s;h that prince on the throne of his ance&s;tors:
but his real aim was to make a divi&s;ion from the Nether|lands,
and excite a revolt in Great-Britain, which &s;hould
hinder Queen Anne from exerting her&s;elf again&s;t France
on the continent. He began to make preparations for this
expedition at Dunkirk, where a &s;quadron was a&s;&s;embled
under the command of the Chevalier de Fourbin; and a
body of land-forces were embarked with Mon&s;ieur de Gace,
afterwards known by the appellation of the Mare&s;chal de
Matignon. The Pretender, who had a&s;&s;umed the name of
the Chevalier de St. George, was furni&s;hed with &s;ervices
of gold and &s;ilver plate, &s;umptuous tents, rich clothes for
his life-guards, &s;plendid liveries, and all &s;orts of nece&s;|&s;aries
even to profu&s;ion. Louis at parting pre&s;ented him
with a &s;word &s;tudded with valuable diamonds, and re|peated
what he had formerly &s;aid to this adventurer's father;
<PB N="123" REF="129">
&startq;He hoped he &s;hould never &s;ee him again.&endq; The Pope
contributed to the expen&s;e of this expedition, and accom|modated
him with divers religious in&s;criptions, which
were wrought upon his colours and &s;tandards. Queen
Anne being informed of the&s;e preparations, and the de&s;ign
of the French monarch, communicated to the Commons
the advices which &s;he had received from Holland and the
Netherlands, touching the de&s;tination of the Dunkirk
armament: both Hou&s;es concurred in an addre&s;s, a&s;&s;uring
her they would a&s;&s;i&s;t her Maje&s;ty with their lives and for|tunes
again&s;t the pretended Prince of Wales, and all her
other enemies. Then they pa&s;&s;ed a bill, enacting, That
the oath of abjuration &s;hould be tendered to all per&s;ons, and
&s;uch as refu&s;ed to take it &s;hould be in the condition of
convicted recu&s;ants. By another, they &s;u&s;pended the Ha|beas
Corpus act till October, with relation to per&s;ons ap|prehended
by the government on &s;u&s;picion of trea&s;onable
practices. The Pretender and his adherents were pro|claimed
traitors and rebels; and a bill was pa&s;&s;ed, di&s;charg|ing
the clans of Scotland from all va&s;&s;alage to tho&s;e chiefs
who &s;hould take up arms again&s;t her Maje&s;ty. Tran&s;ports
were hired to bring over ten Briti&s;h battalions from O&s;tend:
a large fleet being equipped with incredible diligence,
&s;ailed from Deal towards Dunkirk, under the conduct of
Sir John Leake, Sir George Byng, and Lord Dur&s;ley.
The French imagined that Leake had &s;ailed to Li&s;bon,
and that Britain was unprovided of &s;hips of war; &s;o that
they were amazed and confounded when this fleet appeared
off Mardyke: a &s;top was immediately put to the embark|ation
of their troops: frequent expre&s;&s;es were di&s;patched
to Paris: The Count de Fourbin repre&s;ented to the French
King the little probability of &s;ucceeding in this enterpri&s;e,
and the danger that would attend the attempt: but he re|ceived
po&s;itive orders to embark the forces, and &s;et &s;ail with
the fir&s;t favourable wind.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXI. The Briti&s;h fleet being forced from their
&s;tation by &s;evere weather on the fourteenth day of March,
the French &s;quadron &s;ailed on the &s;eventeenth from the
<PB N="124" REF="130">
road of Dunkirk: but the wind &s;hifting, it anchored in
Newport-pits, till the nineteenth in the evening, when
they &s;et &s;ail again with a fair breeze, &s;teering their cour&s;e
for Scotland. Sir George Byng having received advice
of their departure, from an O&s;tend ve&s;&s;el &s;ent out for that
purpo&s;e by Major-General Cadogan, gave cha&s;e to the
enemy, after having detached a &s;quadron under Admiral
Baker, to convoy the troops that were embarked at O&s;tend
for England. On the tenth day of March, the Queen
went to the Hou&s;e of Peers, where, in a &s;peech to both
Hou&s;es, &s;he told them that the French fleet had &s;ailed;
that Sir George Byng was in pur&s;uit of them; and that
ten battalions of her troops were expected every day in
England. This intimation was followed by two very
warm addre&s;&s;es from the Lords and Commons, in which
they repeated their a&s;&s;urances of &s;tanding by her again&s;t all
her enemies. They exhorted her to per&s;evere in &s;upport|ing
the common cau&s;e, notwith&s;tanding this petty attempt
to di&s;turb her dominions; and levelled &s;ome &s;evere in&s;inu|ations
again&s;t tho&s;e who endeavoured to foment jealou&s;ies
between her Maje&s;ty and her mo&s;t faithful &s;ervants. Ad|dre&s;&s;es
on the &s;ame occa&s;ion were &s;ent up from different
parts of the kingdom; &s;o that the Queen &s;eemed to look
with contempt upon the de&s;igns of the enemy. Several
regiments of foot, with &s;ome &s;quadrons of cavalry, began
their march for Scotland: the Earl of Leven, commander
in chief of the forces in that country, and governor of the
ca&s;tle of Edinburgh, ha&s;tened thither to put that fortre&s;s
in a po&s;ture of defence, and to make the proper di&s;po&s;itions
to oppo&s;e the Pretender at his landing. But the vigilance
of Sir George Byng rendered all the&s;e precautions unne|ce&s;&s;ary.
He &s;ailed directly to the frith of Edinburgh,
where he arrived almo&s;t as &s;oon as the enemy, who im|mediately
took the advantage of a land breeze, and bore
away with all the &s;ail they could carry. The Engli&s;h
Admiral gave cha&s;e; and the Sali&s;bury, one of their &s;hips,
was boarded and taken. At night Mon&s;ieur de Fourbin
altered his cour&s;e; &s;o that next day they were out of reach
<PB N="125" REF="131">
of the Engli&s;h &s;quadron. The Pretender de&s;ired they
would proceed to the northward, and land him at Inver|ne&s;s,
and Fourbin &s;eemed willing to gratify his reque&s;t;
but the wind changing, and blowing in their teeth with
great violence, he repre&s;ented the danger of attempting to
pro&s;ecute the voyage; and, with the con&s;ent of the Cheva|lier
de St. George and his general, returned to Dunkirk,
after having been to&s;&s;ed about a whole month in very tem|pe&s;tuous
weather. In the mean time, Sir George Byng
&s;ailed up to Leith road, where he received the freedom of
the city of Edinburgh in a golden box, as a te&s;timony of
gratitude for his having delivered them from the dreadful
apprehen&s;ions under which they laboured.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXII. Certain it is, the Pretender could not have
cho&s;en a more favourable opportunity for making a de&s;cent
upon Scotland. The people in general were di&s;affected to
the government on account of the union; the regular
troops under Leven did not exceed five-and-twenty hun|dred
men, and even great part of the&s;e would in all proba|bility
have joined the invader: the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh
was de&s;titute of ammunition, and would in all appearance
have &s;urrendered at the fir&s;t &s;ummons; in which ca&s;e the
Jacobites mu&s;t have been ma&s;ters of the equivalent money
lodged in that fortre&s;s: a good number of Dutch &s;hips
loaded with cannon, &s;mall arms, ammunition, and a large
&s;um of money, had been driven on &s;hore in the &s;hire of
Angus, where they would have been &s;ei&s;ed by the friends
of the Pretender, had the French troops been landed; and all
the adherents of that hou&s;e were ready to appear in arms.
In England, &s;uch a demand was made upon the Bank, by
tho&s;e who favoured the inva&s;ion, and tho&s;e who dreaded
a revolution, that the publick credit &s;eemed to be in danger.
The Commons re&s;olved, That whoever de&s;ignedly endea|voured
to le&s;&s;en or de&s;troy the publick credit, e&s;pecially at a
time when the kingdom was threatened with an inva&s;ion,
was guilty of a high crime and mi&s;demeanor, and an enemy
to her Maje&s;ty and the kingdom. The Lord-Trea&s;urer &s;ig|nified
to the directors of the Bank, that her Maje&s;ty would
<PB N="126" REF="132">
allow, for &s;ix months, an intere&s;t of &s;ix per cent. upon their
bills, which was double the u&s;ual rate; and con&s;ider|able

The French refugees, &s;candali&s;ed at their behaviour, and authori&s;ed by the Bi&s;hop of London, as &s;uperior of the French congregations, re&s;olved to enquire into the mi&s;&s;ion of the&s;e pretended prophets, who&s;e names were Elias Marion, John Cavallier, and Durand Fage. They were declared impo&s;tors and counterfeits. Notwith|&s;tanding this deci&s;ion, which was confirmed by the bi&s;hops, they continued their a&s;&s;emblies in Soho, under the countenance of Sir Richard Bulkeley and John Lacy. They reviled the mini&s;ters of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church; they de|nounced judgments again&s;t the city of London, and the whole Briti&s;h nation; and publi&s;hed their predictions, compo&s;ed of unintelligible jargon. Then they were pro&s;ecuted at the expence of the French churches, as di&s;turbers of the publick peace, and fal&s;e prophets. They were &s;entenced to pay a fine of twenty marks each, and &s;tand twice on a &s;caffold, with papers on their brea&s;ts denoting their offence; a &s;entence which was executed accordingly at Charing-Cro&s;s, and the Royal-Exchange.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of this year, Mr. Stanhope, who was re&s;ident from the Queen at the court of Charles, concluded a treaty of commerce with this monarch, which would have proved extremely advantageous to Great-Britain, had he been firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed on the throne of Spain. It was &s;tipulated that the Engli&s;h merchants &s;hould enjoy the privilege of importing all kinds of merchandi&s;e from the coa&s;t of Barbary into the maritime places of Spain, without paying any higher duty than if that merchandi&s;e had been the pro|duce of Great-Britain; and that even the&s;e duties &s;hould not be paid till &s;ix months after the merchandi&s;e &s;hould be landed and &s;old, the merchants giving &s;ecurity for the cu&s;toms. It was agreed that the whole commerce of the Spa|ni&s;h We&s;t-Indies &s;hould be carried on by a joint company of Spani&s;h and Bri|ti&s;h merchants; and in the interim, as the greater part of that country was in the hands of Philip, his competitor con&s;ented that the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects &s;hould trade freely in all the ports of the We&s;t Indies with ten &s;hips of five hundred tons each, under &s;uch convoy as her Britannick Maje&s;ty &s;hould think fit to appoint.</P></NOTE>.</P>

&sect; XXXIII. On the fir&s;t day of April,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. IX. 1708.</NOTE> the parliament
was prorogued, and afterwards di&s;&s;olved by proclamation.
Writs were i&s;&s;ued out for new elections, together with a
proclamation, commanding all the peers of North-Bri|tain
to a&s;&s;emble at Holyrood-hou&s;e in Edinburgh, on the
&s;eventeenth day of June, to elect &s;ixteen peers to repre&s;ent
them in the en&s;uing Briti&s;h parliament, pur&s;uant to the
twenty-&s;econd article of the treaty of union. After the
di&s;&s;olution of parliament, the Lords Grifffin, Clermont, two
&s;ons of the Earle of Middleton, and &s;everal Scotti&s;h and
Iri&s;h officers, who had been taken on board the Sali&s;bury,
were brought to London, and impri&s;oned in the Tower or
in Newgate. Lord Griffin being attainted by outlawry, for
high-trea&s;on committed in the reign of King William,
was brought to the bar in the court of King's-Bench, and
a rule made for his execution; but he was reprieved from
month to month, until he died of a natural death in pri|&s;on.
The privy-council of Scotland was di&s;&s;olved; the
Duke of Queen&s;berry was created a Briti&s;h peer, by the
title of Baron of Rippon, Marquis of Beverly, and Duke
of Dover; and the office of &s;ecretary at war, vacant by
the re&s;ignation of Henry St. John, was be&s;towed upon Ro|bert
Walpole, a gentleman who had rendered him&s;elf con|&s;iderable
in the Hou&s;e of Commons, and who&s;e conduct
we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to mention more at large in the &s;e|quel.
About the &s;ame time a proclamation was i&s;&s;ued for
di&s;tributing prizes, in certain proportions, to the different
officers and &s;eamen of the royal navy; a regulation that
&s;till prevails.</P>

&sect; XXXIV.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK 1. 1708.</NOTE> The French King, not at all di&s;couraged
by the mi&s;carriage of his projected inva&s;ion, re&s;olved to
improve the advantages he had gained on the continent
during the la&s;t campaign; and indeed he made efforts that
were altogether incredible, con&s;idering the con&s;umptive
&s;tate of his finances.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Before the opening of the campaign, a very daring enterpri&s;e was formed by one Colonel Queintern, a parti&s;an in the Imperial army. This man laid a &s;cheme for carrying off the Dauphin of France from the court of Ver&s;ailles. He &s;elected thirty men of approved valour for this undertaking. He procured pa&s;&s;es for them, and they rendezvou&s;ed in the neighbourhood of Paris. On the twenty-fourth day of March, in the evening, he and his accomplices &s;top|ped a coach and &s;ix, with the King's liveries, and arre&s;ted the per&s;on who was in it, on the &s;uppo&s;ition of his being a prince of the blood. It was, how|ever, M. de Berringhen, the King's fir&s;t equerry. This officer they mounted on a &s;pare hor&s;e, and &s;et out for the Low Countries: but, being little ac|quainted with the roads, they did not reach Cha$$tilly till next morning, when they heard the Toxen, or alarm bell, and thence concluded that de|tachments were &s;ent out in pur&s;uit of them. Neverthele&s;s, they proceeded boldly, and would certainly have carried the point, had not Queintern halted three hours for the refre&s;hment of his pri&s;oner, who complained of being in|di&s;po&s;ed. He likewi&s;e procured a chai&s;e, and ordered the back of it to be low|ered for his convenience. The&s;e acts of humanity retarded him &s;o much, that he was overtaken by a detachment of hor&s;e at Ham, within three hours ride of a place of &s;afety. Finding him&s;elf &s;urrounded, he thought proper to &s;ur|render, and M. de Berringhen treated him with great genero&s;ity, for the civi|lities he had received at his hands. He carried him back to Ver&s;ailles, and lodged him in his own apartments. Madame de Berringhen made him a con|&s;iderable pre&s;ent: and the King ordered him and his companions to be di&s;|charged, on account of the courage and humanity they had di&s;played.</NOTE>. He a&s;&s;embled a prodigious army
in the Netherlands, under the command of the Duke of
Burgundy, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Vendome, and accompanied by the
Duke of Berry and the Chevalier de St. George. The
Elector of Bavaria was de&s;tined to the command of the
troops upon the Rhine, where he was &s;econded by the
Duke of Berwick; and the Mare&s;chal de Villeroy was
&s;ent to conduct the forces in Dauphin&eacute;. About the latter
end of March, the Duke of Marlborough repaired to the
Hague, where he was met by Prince Eugene; the&s;e two
celebrated generals conferred with the Pen&s;ionary Hein|&s;ius,
and the deputies of the States-General. Then they
made an excur&s;ion to Hanover, where they prevailed upon
<PB N="129" REF="135">
the Elector to be &s;atisfied with acting upon the defen&s;ive
in his command on the Rhine, and &s;pare part of his
forces, that the confederates might be enabled to make
vigorous efforts in the Netherlands. The Prince pro|ceeded
to Vienna, and the Duke immediately returned
to Flanders, where he a&s;&s;embled the army towards the
latter end of May. On the twenty-fifth day of that
month, the Duke de Vendome marched to Soignies, and
po&s;ted him&s;elf within three leagues of the confederates,
who were encamped at Billinghen and Halle. The Duke
of Marlborough having received intelligence that the ene|my
were on their march by Bois-Seigneur-I&s;aac to Braine-la-Leuwe,
concluded their intention was to take po&s;t on
the banks of the Deule, to hinder the allies from pa&s;&s;ing
that river, and to occupy Louvaine. He, therefore, com|manded
the army to march all night, and on the third
day of June encamped at Terbank, General D'Auver|querque
fixing his quarters in the &s;uburbs of Louvaine,
while the French advanced no farther than Genap and
Braine-la-Leuwe. As they were more numerous than the
con&s;ederates, and headed by a prince of the blood, the
generals of the allies at fir&s;t expected that they would hazard
a battle: but their &s;cheme was to retrieve by &s;tratagem the
places they had lo&s;t in Flanders. The Elector of Bavaria
had rendered him&s;elf extremely popular in the great towns:
the Count de Bergeyck, who had con&s;iderable intere&s;t
among them, was devoted to the Hou&s;e of Bour|bon:
the inhabitants of the great cities were naturally
incon&s;tant and mutinous, and particularly di&s;&s;atisfied with
the Dutch government. The French generals re&s;olved to
profit by the&s;e circum&s;tances. A detachment of their
troops, under the Brigadeers la Faille and Pa&s;t$ur, &s;ur|pri&s;ed
the city of Ghent, in which there was no garri&s;on:
at the &s;ame time, the Count de la Motte, with a &s;trong
body of forces, appeared before Bruges, which was &s;ur|rendered
to him without oppo&s;ition: then he made a fruit|le&s;s
attempt upon Damme, and marched to the little fort
of Pla&s;&s;endhal, which he took by a&s;&s;ault. The Duke of
<PB N="130" REF="136">
Marlborough was no &s;ooner appri&s;ed of the enemy's having
&s;ent a &s;trong detachment towards Tubize, than he march|ed
from Terbank, pa&s;&s;ed the canal, and encamped at An|derlech.
The French cro&s;&s;ed the Senne at Halle and
Tubize, and the allies re&s;olved to attack them next morn|ing:
but the enemy pa&s;&s;ed the Dender in the night with
great expedition; and the Duke of Marlborough next day
encamped at A&s;che, where he was joined by Prince Eu|gene,
who had marched with a con&s;iderable re-enforcement
of Germans from the Mo&s;elle. The enemy under&s;tanding
that this general was on his march, determined to reduce
Oudenarde, the only pa&s;s on the Schelde po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the
confederates; and inve&s;ted it on the ninth day of July,
hoping to &s;ubdue it before the allies could be re-enforced.
The Duke of Marlborough was immediately in motion,
and made a &s;urpri&s;ing march from A&s;che, as far as Her&s;e|lingen,
where he was joined by the re-enforcement. Then
he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;trong camp at Le&s;&s;ines, which
the French had intended to occupy, in order to cover the
&s;iege of Oudenarde.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXV. Thus di&s;appointed, the French generals
altered their re&s;olution, abandoned Oudenarde, and began
to pa&s;s the Schelde at Gavre. The two generals of the
confederates were bent upon bringing them to an engage|ment.
Cadogan was &s;ent with &s;ixteen battalions and eight
&s;quadrons to repair the roads, and throw bridges over the
Schelde below Oudenarde. The army was in motion at
eight o'clock, and marched with &s;uch expedition, that
by two in the afternoon the hor&s;e had reached the bridges
over which Cadogan and his detachment were pa&s;&s;ing.
The enemy had po&s;ted &s;even battalions in the village of
Heynem, &s;ituated on the banks of the Schelde, and the
French hou&s;ehold-troops were drawn up in order of battle
on the adjacent plain, oppo&s;ite to a body of troops under
Major-General Rantzaw, who were po&s;ted behind a
rivulet that ran into the river. The Duke de Vendome
intended to attack the confederates when one half of their
army &s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed the Schelde: but he was thwarted
<PB N="131" REF="137">
by the Duke of Burgundy, who &s;eemed to be perplexed
and irre&s;olute. This prince had ordered the troop to
halt in their march to Gavre, as if he had not yet formed
any re&s;olution; and now he recalled the &s;quadrons from
the plain, determined to avoid a battle. Vendome re|mon&s;trated
again&s;t this conduct, and the di&s;pute continued
till three in the afternoon, when the greater part of the
allied army had pa&s;&s;ed the Schelde without oppo&s;ition.
Then the Duke of Burgundy declared for an engagement,
and Vendome &s;ubmitted to his opinion with great re|luctance,
as the opportunity was now lo&s;t, and the army
unformed. Major-General Grimaldi was ordered to at|tack
Rantzaw with the hor&s;e of the King's hou&s;ehold,
who, finding the rivulet mar&s;hy, refu&s;ed to charge, and
retired to the right. Mean while Cadogan attacked the
village of Heynem, which he took, with three of the
&s;even battalions by which it was guarded. Rantzaw
pa&s;&s;ing the rivulet, advanced into the plain, and drove
before him &s;everal &s;quadrons of the enemy. In this attack
the electoral Prince of Hanover, his late Maje&s;ty, Geo. II.
charged at the head of Bulau's dragoons with great intre|pidity.
His hor&s;e was &s;hot under him, and Colonel
La&s;chky killed by his &s;ide. Divers French regiments
were entirely broken, and a good number of officers and
&s;tandards fell into the hands of the Hanoverians. The
confederates continued &s;till pa&s;&s;ing the river: but few or
none of the infantry were come up till five in the after|noon,
when the Duke of Argyle arrived with twenty
battalions, which immediately &s;u&s;tained a vigorous a&s;&s;ault
from the enemy. By this time the French were drawn
up in order of battle; and the allies being formed as they
pa&s;&s;ed the river, both armies were engaged through the
whole extent of their lines about &s;even in the evening.
Europe had not for many years produced two &s;uch noble
armies: above one hundred general officers appeared in
the field, and two hundred and fifty colonels fought at
the head of their re&s;pective regiments. The number of
the French exceeded that of the allies by twelve thou&s;and:
<PB N="132" REF="138">
but their generals were divided; their forces ill-di&s;po&s;ed;
and the men di&s;pirited by the uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;s of
their adver&s;aries. They &s;eemed from the beginning aver&s;e
to an engagement, and acted in hurry and trepidation.
Neverthele&s;s, the action was maintained until General
D'Auverquerque and Count Tilly, who commanded on
the left of the allies, obliged the right of the enemy to
give ground; and the Prince of Orange, with Count
Oxien&s;tern, attacked them in flank with the Dutch in|fantry.
Then they began to give way, and retired in
great confu&s;ion. The Duke de Vendome alighting from
his hor&s;e, rallied the broken battalions, called the officers
by name, conjured them to maintain the honour of their
country, and animated the men with his voice and exam|ple.
But, notwith&s;tanding all his endeavours, they were
forced back among the enclo&s;ures in great confu&s;ion.
Some regiments were cut in pieces: others de&s;ired to capi|tulate;
and, if the darkne&s;s had not interpo&s;ed, their
whole army would have been ruined. The night coming
on, &s;o that it became impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;tingui&s;h friends
from enemies, the two generals ordered the troops to
cea&s;e firing, and the enemy took this opportunity of e&s;cap|ing,
by the road which leads from Oudenarde to Ghent.
The Duke de Vendome &s;eeing the French forces flying in
the utmo&s;t terror and precipitation, formed a rear-guard
of about five-and-twenty &s;quadrons, and as many batta|lions,
with which he &s;ecured the retreat. To this pre|caution
the &s;afety of their army was entirely owing; for
at day-break the Duke of Marlborough &s;ent a large de|tachment
of hor&s;e and foot, under the Lieutenant-Generals
Bulau and Lumley, to pur&s;ue the fugitives: but the
hedges and ditches that &s;kirted the road were lined with
the French grenadiers in &s;uch a manner, that the cavalry
could not form, and they were obliged to de&s;i&s;t. The
French reached Ghent about eight in the morning, and
marching through the city, encamped at Lovendegen on
the canal. There they thought proper to ca&s;t up en|trenchments,
upon which they planted their artillery,
<PB N="133" REF="139">
which they had left at Gavre with their heavy baggage.
About three thou&s;and were &s;lain on the field of battle: two
thou&s;and de&s;erted; and about &s;even thou&s;and were taken,
including a great number of officers, together with ten pieces
of cannon, above an hundred &s;tandards and colours, and four
thou&s;and hor&s;es. The lo&s;s of the allies did not amount to
two thou&s;and men; nor was one officer of di&s;tinction killed
on their &s;ide during the whole engagement<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Among the officers who were engaged in this battle, old General D'Auverquerque and the Duke of Argyle di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by the mo&s;t extraordinary valour and activity.</NOTE>. After the
confederates had re&s;ted two days on the field of battle, a
detachment was ordered to level the French lines between
Ypres and the Lys: another was &s;ent to rai&s;e contribu|tions
as far as Arras: they ravaged the country, and
&s;truck terrour even into the city of Paris. While the
allies plundered the province of Picardy, a detachment
from the French army, under the Chevalier de Rozen,
made an irruption into Dutch-Flanders; broke through
the lines of Bervliet, which had been left unguarded, and
made a de&s;cent upon the i&s;land of Cad&s;andt, which they
laid under contribution.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVI. The generals of the allies now undertook
an enterpri&s;e, which, in the opinion of the French generals,
$avoured of ra&s;hne&s;s and incon&s;iderate &s;elf-&s;ufficiency.
This was the &s;iege of Li&s;le, the &s;tronge&s;t town in Flanders,
provided with all nece&s;&s;aries, &s;tore of ammunition, and a
garri&s;on re-enforced with one-and-twenty battalions of
the be&s;t troops in France, commanded by Mare&s;chal de
Bou&s;&s;lers in per&s;on. But the&s;e were not the principal
difficulties which the allies encountered. The enemy had
cut off the communication between them and their maga|zines
at Antwerp and Sas-Van-Ghent; &s;o that they were
obliged to bring their convoys from O&s;tend along a narrow
cau&s;eway, expo&s;ed to the attack of an army more nume|rous
than that with which they &s;at down before Li&s;le. On
the thirteenth of Augu&s;t it was inve&s;ted on one &s;ide by
<PB N="134" REF="140">
Prince Eugene, and on the other by the Prince of Orange-Na&s;&s;au,
Stadtholder of Frie&s;land; while the Duke of
Marlborough encamped at Helchin, to cover the &s;iege.
The trenches were opened on the twenty-&s;econd day of
Augu&s;t, and carried on with that vigour and alacrity
which is always in&s;pired by victory and &s;ucce&s;s. The
Dukes of Burgundy and Vendome being now joined by
the Duke of Berwick re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to relieve the
place; and made &s;everal marches and counter-marches
for this purpo&s;e. Marlborough, being appri&s;ed of their
intention, marched out of his lines to give them battle,
being re-enforced by a con&s;iderable body of troops from
the &s;iege, including Augu&s;tus King of Poland, and the
Landgrave of He&s;&s;e, as volunteers; but the enemy declined
and engagement, and the allies returned to their camp,
which they fortified with an entrenchment. On the
&s;eventh day of September, the be&s;iegers took by a&s;&s;ault
the counter&s;carp of Li&s;le, after an ob&s;tinate action, in
which they lo&s;t a thou&s;and men. The French generals
continued to hover about the camp of the confederates,
which they actually cannonaded; and the Duke of Marl|borough
again formed his army in order of battle; but
their de&s;ign was only to harra&s;s the allies with continual
alarms, and interrupt the operations of the &s;iege. They
endeavoured to &s;urpri&s;e the town of Aeth, by means of a
&s;ecret corre&s;pondence with the inhabitants: but the con|&s;piracy
was di&s;covered before it took effect. Then they
cut off all communication between the be&s;iegers and the
Schelde, the banks of which they fortified with &s;trong
entrenchments, and a prodigious number of cannon; &s;o
that now all the &s;tores and nece&s;&s;aries were &s;ent to the
camp of the confederates from O&s;tend. On the twenty-fir&s;t
day of September, Prince Eugene, who was in the
trenches, &s;eeing the troops driven by the enemy from a
lodgement they had made on the counter&s;carp of the Te|naille,
rallied and led them back to the charge; but being
wounded over the left eye with a mu&s;ket-&s;hot, he was
<PB N="135" REF="141">
obliged to retire, and for &s;ome days the Duke of Marlbo|rough
&s;u&s;tained the whole command, both in the &s;iege,
and of the covering army. On the twenty-third the
Tenaille was &s;tormed, and a lodgement made along the
covered-way. Mare&s;chal Boufflers having found means
to inform the Duke de Vendome that his ammunition was
almo&s;t expended, this general detached the Chevalier de
Luxemburg, with a body of hor&s;e and dragoons, to &s;upply
the place with gunpowder, every man carrying a bag of
forty pounds upon the crupper. They were di&s;covered in
pa&s;&s;ing through the camp of the allies, and pur&s;ued to the
barrier of the town, into which about three hundred were
admitted; but a great number were killed by the confede|rates,
or mi&s;erably de&s;troyed by the explo&s;ion of the powder
which they carried.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVII. The next attempt of the French generals
was to intercept a convoy from O&s;tend. The Count de
la Motte marched from Ghent, with about two-and-twenty
thou&s;and men, to attack this convoy, which was
guarded by &s;ix thou&s;and of the allies, commanded by Ma|jor-General
Webb. This officer made &s;uch an admirable
di&s;po&s;ition by the wood of Wynendale, and received the
enemy with &s;uch a clo&s;e &s;ire, that, after a very warm
action, that la&s;ted two hours, they retired in the utmo&s;t
confu&s;ion, notwith&s;tanding their great &s;uperiority in
number, leaving &s;ix thou&s;and men killed upon the field of
battle; the lo&s;s of the allies not exceeding nine hundred
and twelve officers and &s;oldiers. This was the mo&s;t ho|nourable
exploit performed during the whole war, and
of &s;uch con&s;equence to the confederates, that if the convoy
had been taken, the &s;iege mu&s;t have been rai&s;ed. The
Duke de Vendome ordered the dykes between Bruges and
Newport to be cut, &s;o as to lay the whole country under
water, in hopes of de&s;troying the communication between
O&s;tend and the camp of the confederates; and, after a
regular &s;iege, he took Colonel Caul&s;ield and a body of
Briti&s;h troops po&s;ted in the village of Le&s;&s;inghen, by
who&s;e means the convoys had been forwarded to the Duke
<PB N="136" REF="142">
of Marlborough. On the twenty-&s;econd of October,
mare&s;chal Boufflers de&s;ired to capitulate for the town of
Li&s;le; next day the articles were &s;igned; on the twenty-fifth
the allies took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the place, and the Ma|re&s;chal
retired into the citadel with the remains of his
garri&s;on, which, from twelve thou&s;and, was reduced to
le&s;s than the half of that number. A negociation was
begun for the &s;urrender of the citadel; but Boufflers made
&s;uch extravagant demands as were rejected with di&s;dain.
Ho&s;tilities were renewed on the twenty-ninth day of the
month; and the Earl of Stair was detached to provide
corn for the army in the di&s;tricts of Furnes and Dixmuyde.
During the&s;e tran&s;actions, Velt-Mare&s;chal d'Auverquerque
died at Rou&s;&s;elaer, in the &s;ixty-&s;eventh year of his age,
after having, in above thirty campaigns, exhibited innu|merable
proofs of uncommon courage, ability, and mode|ration.
The Duke de Vendome did not yet de&s;pair of
obliging the confederates to abandon their enterpri&s;e; the
French mini&s;ters at Rome and Venice publickly declared
the allied army was cooped up in &s;uch a manner, that it
mu&s;t either rai&s;e the &s;iege or be fami&s;hed. The Elector
of Bavaria, with a detachment of ten thou&s;and men,
marched to Bru&s;&s;els, and attacked the counter&s;carp with
incredible fury; but was repul&s;ed by the garri&s;on, under
the command of General Pa&s;chal, and retired with preci|pitation,
when he under&s;tood that the Duke of Marlbo|rough
was in motion to relieve the place. This nobleman
and Prince Eugene no &s;ooner under&s;tood the danger to
which Bru&s;&s;els was expo&s;ed, than they marched with the
covering-army to the Schelde, which they pa&s;&s;ed on pon|$oons
without oppo&s;ition, notwith&s;tanding the formidable
works which the French had rai&s;ed. They now aban|doned
them with precipitation, to the &s;urpri&s;e of the con|federates,
who had laid their account with the lo&s;s of a
thou&s;and men in the attack. Having pa&s;&s;ed the river be|tween
E&s;kenaffe and Hauterive, as well as at other places,
they marched to Oudenarde, where they received intelli|gence
that the Elector had retreated. Then Prince Eugene
<PB N="137" REF="143">
returned to Li&s;le, and the Duke of Marlborough proceeded
to Bru&s;&s;els, where he was received with joy and acclama|tion.
He afterwards took po&s;t at Oudenarde, &s;o as to
maintain a communication with Prince Eugene.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVIII. The be&s;iegers having made lodgements,
and rai&s;ed batteries on the &s;econd counter&s;carp of the ci|tadel,
&s;ent a me&s;&s;age to Boufflers, intimating, that if he
would &s;urrender before the opening of the batteries, he
&s;hould have an honourable capitulation; otherwi&s;e he and
his garri&s;on mu&s;t be made pri&s;oners of war. He cho&s;e to
avoid the la&s;t part of the alternative: ho&s;tages were ex|changed
on the eighth day of December, and the articles
&s;igned on the tenth; when the Mare&s;chal and his garri&s;on
marched out with the honours of war, and were con|ducted
to Douay. In this great enterpri&s;e, &s;pirit and
per&s;everance made amends for want of fore&s;ight and &s;kill,
which was &s;lagrant on the &s;ide of the confederates; yet
their &s;ucce&s;s was owing in a great mea&s;ure to the improvi|dence
and mi&s;conduct of the be&s;ieged. The French
generals never dreamed that the allies would attempt any
thing of con&s;equence after the reduction of Li&s;le, con&s;i|dering
the advanced &s;ea&s;on of the year, and therefore they
returned to Paris, after having di&s;tributed their army into
winter quarters. But their indefatigable antagoni&s;ts were
determined to &s;trike another &s;troke of importance before
their forces &s;hould &s;eparate. On the twentieth day of
December they inve&s;ted the city of Ghent on all &s;ides;
and on the thirtieth, when the batteries were ready to
open, the Count de la Motte, who commanded the garri|&s;on,
de&s;ired to capitulate. On the third day of the next
month he marched out with thirty battalions and &s;ixteen
$quadrons, which were conducted to Tournay; while the
Duke of Argyle, with &s;ix Briti&s;h battalions, took po&s;&s;e&s;|ion
of the town and citadel. Then the enemy abandoned
$ruges, Pla&s;&s;endabl, and Le&s;&s;engen; and the generals of
$he allies, having &s;ettled the plan of winter quarters, re|$aired
to Holland, leaving the forces under the command
$f Count Tilly. The French King was confounded and
<PB N="138" REF="144">
di&s;mayed at the&s;e conque&s;ts in the Netherlands. Nor was
he ea&s;y on the &s;ide of Dauphin&eacute;: in &s;pight of all the vigi|lance
and activity of Villars, the Duke of Savoy made
him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the important fortre&s;&s;es of Exilles, La
Perou&s;e, the valley of St. Martin, and Fene&s;trelles; &s;o
that by the end of the campaign he had &s;ecured a barrier
to his own frontiers, and opened a way into the French
provinces, after having made a diver&s;ion in favour of King
Charles, by obliging the enemy to &s;end a &s;trong detach|ment
from Rou$illon to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Villars.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIX. The campaign in Catalonia was productive
of a great event. Count Guido de Staremberg arrived at
Barcelona on the la&s;t day of April; but the Imperial troops
brought from Italy by Admiral Leake did not land in
time to relieve Torto&s;a, which the Duke of Orleans be|&s;ieged
and took, together with Denia, the garri&s;on of
which were made pri&s;oners of war, contrary to the arti|cles
of capitulation. The&s;e lo&s;&s;es, however, were abun|dantly
made up to the allies by the conque&s;t of Sardinia
and Minorca. Sir John Leake, having taken on board a
handful of troops, under the conduct of the Marquis
D'Alconzel, &s;et &s;ail for Cagliari, and &s;ummoned the
Viceroy to &s;ubmit to King Charles. As he did not &s;end
an immediate an&s;wer, the Admiral began to bombard the
city, and the inhabitants compelled him to &s;urrender at
di&s;cretion. The greater part of the garri&s;on inli&s;ted them|&s;elves
in the &s;ervice of Charles. The deputies of the &s;tates
being a&s;&s;embled by the Marquis D'Alconzel, acknow|ledged
that prince as their &s;overeign, and agreed to furni&s;h
his army with thirty thou&s;and &s;acks of corn, which were
accordingly tran&s;ported to Catalonia, where there was a
great &s;carcity of provi&s;ion. Major-General Stanhope
having planned the conque&s;t of Minorca, and concerted
with the Admiral the mea&s;ures nece&s;&s;ary to put it in exe|cution,
obtained from Count Staremberg a few battalions
of Spaniards, Italians, and Portugue&s;e: at the head of
the&s;e he embarked at Barcelona with a fine train of Briti&s;h
artillery, accompanied by Brigadier Wade and Colonel
<PB N="139" REF="145">
Petit, an engineer of great reputation. They landed on
the i&s;land, about two miles from St. Philip's fort, on the
twenty-&s;ixth of Augu&s;t, with about eight hundred ma|rines,
which augmented their number to about three
thou&s;and. Next day they erected batteries; and General
Stanhope ordered a number of arrows to be &s;hot into the
place, to which papers were affixed, written in the Spani&s;h
and French languages, containing threats, that all the
garri&s;on &s;hould be &s;ent to the mines, if they would not
&s;urrender before the batteries were fini&s;hed. The garri|&s;on
con&s;i&s;ted of a thou&s;and Spaniards and &s;ix hundred
French marines, commanded by Colonel la Jonquiere,
who imagined that the number of the be&s;iegers amounted
to at lea&s;t ten thou&s;and; &s;o artfully had they been drawn
up in &s;ight of the enemy. The batteries began to play,
and in a little time demoli&s;hed four towers that &s;erved as
outworks to the fort: then they made a breach in the
outward wall, through which Brigadier Wade, at the head
of the grenadiers, &s;tormed a redoubt, with &s;uch extraor|dinary
valour as &s;truck the be&s;ieged with con&s;ternation.
On the &s;econd or third day they thought proper to beat a
parley, and capitulate, on condition, That they &s;hould
march out with the honours of war: That the Spaniards
&s;hould be tran&s;ported to Murcia, and the French to Toulon.
The&s;e la&s;t, however, were detained, by way of repri&s;al
for the garri&s;on of Denia. The Spani&s;h governor was
&s;o mortified when he learned the real number of the be|&s;iegers,
that on his arrival at Murcia he threw him&s;elf
out of a window in de&s;pair, and was killed upon the &s;pot.
La Jonquiere was confined for life, and all the French
officers incurred their ma&s;ter's di&s;plea&s;ure. Fort St. Philip
being thus reduced, to the amazement of all Europe, and
$e garri&s;on of Port Fornelles having &s;urrendered them|&s;elves
pri&s;oners to the Admirals Leake and Whitaker, the
inhabitants gladly &s;ubmitted to the Engli&s;h government,
$word$ King Philip had oppre&s;&s;ed and deprived them of their
$rivileges: General Stanhope appointed Colonel Pe$it
Governour of Fort St. Philip, and deputy-governour of
<PB N="140" REF="146">
the whole i&s;land. After this important conque&s;t he re|turned
to the army in Spain, where an un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt
to &s;urpri&s;e Torto&s;a fini&s;hed the operations of the cam|paign.</P>
<P>&sect; XL. The Briti&s;h fleet not only contributed to the
reduction of Minorca, but likewi&s;e over-awed the Pope,
who had endeavoured to form a league of the Princes in
Italy again&s;t the Emperor. This pontiff had manife&s;ted
his partiality to the hou&s;e of Bourbon in &s;uch a palpable
manner, that his Imperial Maje&s;ty ordered Mon&s;ieur de
Bonneval to march with the troops that were in Italy,
re-enforced by tho&s;e belonging to the Duke of Modena,
and invade the duchy of Ferrara. He accordingly took
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Comachio and &s;ome other places, pretend|ing
they were allodial e&s;tates belonging to the Duke of
Modena, and fiefs of the Emperor, to which the Holy
&s;ee had no lawful claim. The Viceroy of Naples was
forbid to remit any money to Rome; and the council of
the kingdom drew up a long memorial, containing the
preten&s;ions of his Catholick Maje&s;ty, which &s;truck at
the very foundation of the Pope's temporal power. His
Holine&s;s wrote a long remon&s;trance to the Emperor, on
the inju&s;tice of tho&s;e proceedings, and declared that he
would a&s;&s;ert this cau&s;e though he &s;hould lo&s;e his life in the
conte&s;t. He forthwith began to rai&s;e an army, and re|vived
a plan of forming a league among the princes and
&s;tates of Italy, for their mutual defence. Sir John Leake
had received orders to bombard Civita-Vecchia, in re|&s;entment
for the Pope's having countenanced the Pre|tender's
expedition to Great-Britain; but as the Emperor
and Duke of Savoy hoped to effect an accommodation with
the court of Rome, they prevailed upon the Engli&s;h ad|miral
to &s;u&s;pend ho&s;tilities until they &s;hould have tried the
method of negociation. The Marquis de Prie, a Piedmonte&s;e
nobleman, was &s;ent as amba&s;&s;ador to Rome; but the Pope
would not receive him in that quality. Elated with the
promi&s;es of France, he &s;et the Emperor at de&s;iance; and
his troops having &s;urpri&s;ed a body of Imperiali&s;ts, were &s;o
<PB N="141" REF="147">
barbarous as to cut them all in pieces. The Duke of Savoy
having ended the campaign, the troops of the Emperor,
which had &s;erved under that prince, were ordered to march
into the papal territories, and drove the forces of his Ho|line&s;s
before them, without any regard to number. Bo|logna
capitulated; and Rome began to tremble with the
apprehen&s;ion of being once more &s;acked by a German
army. Then the Pope's courage failed; he was glad to
admit the Marquis de Prie as envoy from the Emperor.
He con&s;ented to di&s;band his new levies; to accommodate
the Imperial troops with winter-quarters in the papal ter|ritories;
to grant the inve&s;titure of Naples to King Charles;
and to allow at all times a pa&s;&s;age to the Imperial troops
through his dominions. On the Upper Rhine the electors
of Bavaria and Hanover were &s;o weak, that they could not
undertake any thing of con&s;equence again&s;t each other.
In Hungary the di&s;putes &s;till continued between the Em|peror
and the malcontents. Poland was at length deli|vered
from the oppre&s;&s;ion exerci&s;ed by the King of Sweden,
who marched into the Ukraine again&s;t the Czar of Mu&s;|covy,
notwith&s;tanding the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions with which that
monarch endeavoured to appea&s;e his indignation. During
the cour&s;e of this year the Engli&s;h merchants &s;u&s;tained no
con&s;iderable lo&s;&s;es by &s;ea: the cruizers were judiciou&s;ly
&s;tationed, and the trade was regularly &s;upplied with con|voys.
In the We&s;t-Indies Commodore Wager de&s;troyed
the admiral of the galleons, and took the rear-admiral on
the coa&s;t of Carthagena. Had the officers of his &s;quadron
done their duty, the greate&s;t part of the fleet would have
fallen into his hands. At his return to Jamaica two of
his captains were tried by a court-martial, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed
from the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>&sect; XLI. The court of England was about this time not
a little di&s;quieted, by the con&s;equences of an outrage
committed on the per&s;on of the Count de Matueof the
Mu&s;covite amba&s;&s;ador. He was publickly arre&s;ted at the
&s;uit of a laceman, and maltreated by the baili&s;&s;s, who
dragged him to pri&s;on, where he continued until he was
<PB N="142" REF="148">
bailed by the Earl of Fever&s;ham. Incen&s;ed at this in&s;ult,
he demanded redre&s;s of the government, and was &s;econded
in his remon&s;trances by the mini&s;ters of the Emperor,
the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, and &s;everal other foreign potentates.
The Queen expre&s;&s;ed uncommon indignation again&s;t the
authors of this violence, who were immediately appre|hended,
and orders were given to pro&s;ecute them with the
utmo&s;t &s;everity of the law. Matueof repeated his com|plaints
with great acrimony; and Mr. Secretary Boyle
a&s;&s;ured him, in the Queen's name, that he &s;hould have
ample &s;atisfaction. Notwith&s;tanding this a&s;&s;urance, he
demanded a pa&s;s for him&s;elf and family; refu&s;ed the or|dinary
pre&s;ents at his departure; and retired to Holland.
From thence he tran&s;mitted a memorial, with a letter from
the Czar to the Queen, in&s;i&s;ting upon her puni&s;hing
with death all the per&s;ons concerned in violating the law
of nations upon the per&s;on of his amba&s;&s;ador. Such
puni&s;hment being altogether incon&s;i&s;tent with the laws of
England, the Queen and her mini&s;try were extremely
perplexed, and held &s;everal councils, to deliberate upon
the mea&s;ures proper to be taken on &s;uch an occa&s;ion.
On the twenty-eighth day of October, Prince George of
Denmark died of an a&s;thma and drop&s;y, with which he had
been long afflicted. He was a prince of an amiable rather
than a &s;hining character, brave, good-natured, mode&s;t,
and humane, but devoid of great talents and ambition.
He had always lived in harmony with the Queen, who,
during the whole term of their union, and e&s;pecially in
his la&s;t illne&s;s, approved her&s;elf a pattern of conjugal
truth and tenderne&s;s. At his death the Earl of Pembroke
was created lord high-admiral, the Earl of Wharton pro|moted
to the government of Ireland, and Lord Somers
appointed pre&s;ident of the council. Notwith&s;tanding
the&s;e promotions of the Whig noblemen, the Duke of
Marlborough declined apace in his credit with the Queen,
who privately con&s;ulted and repo&s;ed her chief confidence
in Mr. Harley, though he had no vi&s;ible concern in the ad|mini&s;tration.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="149">
&sect; XLII. The new parliament, in which the Whig in|tere&s;t
&s;till preponderated, was a&s;&s;embled on the &s;ixteenth day
of November, when they were given to under&s;tand, by a
commi&s;&s;ion under the great &s;eal, that the Archbi&s;hop of
Canterbury, the Chancellor, the Lord-Trea&s;urer, the
Lord-Steward, and the Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, were appoint|ed
to repre&s;ent the per&s;on of her Maje&s;ty, whom decency
would not permit to appear in the Hou&s;e &s;o &s;oon after the
death of her con&s;ort. Sir Richard On&s;low being cho&s;en
&s;peaker of the Lower-Hou&s;e with the Queen's approbation,
the Chancellor, in a &s;peech to both Hou&s;es, recommended
the vigorous pro&s;ecution of the war, telling them her
Maje&s;ty hoped they would enable her to make a con&s;i|derable
augmentation for pre&s;erving and improving the
advantages which the allies had gained in the Netherlands:
that &s;he de&s;ired they would prepare &s;uch bills as might
confirm and render the union effectual; and that if they
would propo&s;e means for the advancement of trade and
manufacture, &s;he would take plea&s;ure in enacting &s;uch
provi&s;ions. Both Hou&s;es having pre&s;ented addre&s;&s;es of
condolance and congratulation, on the death of Prince
George, and the &s;ucce&s;s of her Maje&s;ty's arms during the
la&s;t campaign, the Commons took cognizance of contro|verted
elections, which were decided with &s;hameful par|tiality
for the Whig faction. Then they proceeded to
con&s;ider the different branches of the &s;upply: they approved
of an augmentation of ten thou&s;and men, which was
judged nece&s;&s;ary for the more vigorous pro&s;ecution of the
war; and they voted above &s;even millions for the &s;ervice of
the en&s;uing year. The Bank agreed to circulate two mil|lions
five hundred thou&s;and pounds in Exchequer bills for
the government, on condition that the term of their conti|nuance
&s;hould be prolonged for one-and-twenty years; and
that their &s;tock of two millions two hundred and one thou|&s;and
one hundred and &s;eventy-one pounds &s;hould be dou|bled
by a new &s;ub&s;cription. The two-thirds &s;ub&s;idy was
appropriated for the intere&s;t of the money rai&s;ed by this
expedient.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="150">
&sect; XLIII. Great debates having ari&s;en about Scotti&s;h
elections, the Hou&s;e con&s;idered the petitions and repre|&s;entations
that were delivered, touching the incapacity of
the elde&s;t &s;ons of Scotti&s;h peers, excluded from &s;itting in
the parliament of Great-Britain. Coun&s;el being heard
upon the &s;ubject, that incapacity was confirmed; and
new writs were i&s;&s;ued, that new members might be elected
for the &s;hires of Aberdeen and Linlithgow, in the room of
William Lord Haddo, and James Lord John&s;town. Peti|tions
were likewi&s;e pre&s;ented to the Hou&s;e of Lords by
&s;ome Scotti&s;h peers, concerning their right of voting, and
&s;igning proxies. After warm debates, the Hou&s;e, upon a
divi&s;ion, determined that a Scotti&s;h lord created a peer
of Great-Britain &s;hould no longer retain his vote in
Scotland; and that the noblemen who were in the ca&s;tle
of Edinburgh had a right to &s;ign proxies, after having
taken the oaths to the government. The Scotti&s;h peers and
commoners that &s;at in the Briti&s;h parliament were divided
into two factions. The Duke of Queen&s;berry was in great
credit with the Queen and the Lord-Trea&s;urer, by who&s;e
intere&s;t he was appointed &s;ecretary of &s;tate for Scotland.
His influence in elections was &s;o great, that all offices in
that kingdom were be&s;towed according to his recommen|dation.
He was oppo&s;ed by the Dukes of Hamilton,
Montro&s;e, and Roxburgh, who were &s;upported by the
Earl of Sunderland and Lord Somers; &s;o that the whole
intere&s;t of that country was engro&s;&s;ed by one or other mem|ber
of the mini&s;try. A bill for a general naturalization of
all prote&s;tants was brought into the Hou&s;e, and notwith|&s;tanding
violent oppo&s;ition from the Tories, both among the
Lords and Commons, was enacted into a law. The Whigs
argued for this bill, as a mea&s;ure that would encourage
indu&s;try, improve trade and manufacture, and repair the
wa&s;te of men which the war had occa&s;ioned: but one of
their chief motives was to throw an addition of foreigners
into the balance again&s;t the landed intere&s;t. The Tories
pleaded, that a conflux of aliens might prove dangerous to
the con&s;titution: that they would retain a fondne&s;s for
<PB N="145" REF="151">
their native countries, and, in times of war, act as &s;pies
and enemies: that they would in&s;inuate them&s;elves into
places of tru&s;t and profit; become members of parliament;
and by frequent intermarriages contribute to the extinction
of the Engli&s;h race: that they would add to the number of
the poor, already &s;o expen&s;ive; and &s;hare the bread of the
labourers and trade&s;men of England.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIV. An enquiry being &s;et on foot in both Hou&s;es,
concerning the late intended inva&s;ion of Scotland, Lord
Haver&s;ham and the other Tory members endeavoured to
demon&s;trate, that proper precautions had not been taken
for the &s;ecurity of that kingdom, even after the mini&s;try
had received undoubted intelligence of the Pretender's
de&s;ign: that &s;ince the attempt had mi&s;carried, many per|&s;ons
of quality had been apprehended, and &s;everely u&s;ed
by the government, on pretended &s;u&s;picion of high trea|&s;on;
though, in all probability, the aim of the mini&s;try,
in confining tho&s;e per&s;ons, was to remove all po&s;&s;i|bility
of their oppo&s;ing the court at the en&s;uing elections
for members of parliament. The&s;e a&s;&s;ertions were &s;up|ported
by many inconte&s;ted facts and &s;hrewd arguments,
notwith&s;tanding which, the majority were &s;o little di&s;po&s;ed
to find fault, that the enquiry i&s;&s;ued in a joint addre&s;s to
the Queen, containing re&s;olutions. That timely and
effectual care had been taken to di&s;appoint the de&s;igns of
her Maje&s;ty's enemies, both at home and abroad. A bill,
however, was brought into the Hou&s;e of Lords, under the
title of &startq;An act for improving the union of the two
kingdoms.&endq; It related to trials for trea&s;on in Scotland,
which by this law were regulated according to the manner
of proceeding in England, with &s;ome &s;mall variation.
The Scotti&s;h members oppo&s;ed it as an encroachment upon
the form of their laws; and they were joined by tho&s;e who
had laid it down as a maxim to oppo&s;e all the court-mea|&s;ures:
neverthele&s;s, the bill pa&s;&s;ed through both Hou&s;es,
and received the royal a&s;&s;ent. Yet, in order to &s;weeten
this unpalatable medicine, the Queen con&s;ented to an act
of grace, by which all trea&s;ons were pardoned, except
<PB N="146" REF="152">
tho&s;e committed on the high-&s;eas: an exception levelled at
tho&s;e who had embarked with the Pretender. Major-Gene|ral
Webb, who had been defrauded of his due honour, in
a partial repre&s;entation of the battle of Wynendale, tran&s;|mitted
by Cardonnel, &s;ecretary to the Duke of Marlbo|rough,
was now thanked by the Hou&s;e of Commons for
the great and eminent &s;ervices which he had performed in
that engagement.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet.</NOTE> This motion was made by the Tories;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Daniel.</NOTE>

and the Duke, at his arrival, was thanked, in the name of

in an addre&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the Admirals.</NOTE> de&s;ired the Queen would in&s;i&s;t on the demo|lition

the ocean,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Voltaire.</NOTE> and did infinite prejudice to the com|merce
of England. The Queen promi&s;ed to comply with
their reque&s;t. But &s;he was not a little &s;urpri&s;ed at the
next addre&s;s they pre&s;ented, humbly entreating, that &s;he
would have &s;uch indulgence to the hearty de&s;ires of her
&s;ubjects, as to entertain thoughts of a &s;econd marriage.
She told them, that the provi&s;ion &s;he had made for the
prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion would always be a proof how much
&s;he had at heart the future happine&s;s of the kingdom; but
the &s;ubject of this addre&s;s was of &s;uch a nature, that &s;he
was per&s;uaded they did not expect a particular an&s;wer.</P>
<P>&sect; XLV. The laws having been found in&s;ufficient to
puni&s;h capitally the authors of the in&s;ult offered to the Mu&s;|covite
amba&s;&s;ador, a bill was brought into the Hou&s;e of
Commons for pre&s;erving the privileges of amba&s;&s;adors and
other foreign mini&s;ters; and pa&s;&s;ed through both Hou&s;es:
as did another, to prevent the laying of wagers relating to
the publick, a practice which had been carried to a degree
of infatuation; and by which many unwary per&s;ons fell a
&s;acrifice to crafty adventurers.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1709.</NOTE> On the fourteenth day of
<PB N="147" REF="153">
March the Commons voted the &s;um of one hundred and
three thou&s;and two hundred and three pounds, for the
relief of the inhabitants of Nevis and St. Chri&s;topher's,
who had &s;uffered by the late inva&s;ion: and on the twenty-fir&s;t
day of April the parliament was prorogued. The
Mu&s;covite amba&s;&s;ador continued to write expo&s;tulatory
letters to Mr. Secretary Boyle, who at la&s;t owned, that
the laws of the kingdom did not admit of &s;uch puni&s;hment
as he demanded. An information was tried in the court
of Queen's-Bench for her Maje&s;ty again&s;t Thomas Morton,
laceman, and thirteen other per&s;ons concerned in the in|&s;ult,
of which they were found guilty; and the &s;pecial
matter of the privileges of amba&s;&s;adors was to be argued
next term before the judges. Mean while, the Queen,
by way of &s;atisfaction to the Czar, conde&s;cended to make
&s;olemn excu&s;es by her amba&s;&s;ador; to repair Matueof's
honour by a letter, and indemnify him for all his co&s;ts and
damages: conce&s;&s;ions with which the Czar and his am|ba&s;&s;ador
declared them&s;elves well &s;atisfied. The convo|cation
had been &s;ummoned, cho&s;en, and returned with
the new parliament: but as the old &s;pirit was &s;uppo&s;ed to
prevail in the Lower Hou&s;e, the Queen, by writ to the
Archbi&s;hop, ordered him to prorogue it from time to time,
until the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament was fini&s;hed.</P>

<P>&sect; I. THE French King was by this time reduced to
&s;uch a &s;tate of humiliation by the lo&s;&s;es of the
la&s;t campaign,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. X. 1709.</NOTE> and a &s;evere winter, which completed the
mi&s;ery of his &s;ubjects, that he re&s;olved to &s;acrifice all the
con&s;iderations of pride and ambition, as well as the intere&s;t
of his grand&s;on, to his de&s;ire of peace, which was now be|come
&s;o nece&s;&s;ary and indi&s;pen&s;ible. He di&s;patched the
pre&s;ident Rouill&eacute; privately to Holland, with general pro|po&s;als
of peace, and the offer of a good barrier to the
States-General, &s;till entertaining hopes of being able to
detach them from the confederacy. This mini&s;ter confer|red
in &s;ecret with Buys and Vanderdu&s;&s;en, the pen&s;ionaries
of Am&s;terdam and Gouda, at Moerdyke, from whence he
was permitted to proceed to Woerden, between Leyden
and Utrecht. The States immediately communicated
his propo&s;als to the courts of Vienna and Great-Britain.
Prince Eugene and the Duke of Marlborough arrived at
the Hague in April, and conferred with the grand pen|&s;ionary
Hein&s;ius, Buys, and Vanderdu&s;&s;en, on the &s;ubject
of the French propo&s;als, which were deemed un&s;atisfactory.
Rouill&eacute; immediately di&s;patched a courier to Paris, for fur|ther
in&s;tructions; and the Duke of Marlborough returned
to England, to make the Queen acquainted with the pro|gre&s;s
of the negociation. Louis, in order to convince the
&s;tates of his &s;incerity, &s;ent the Marquis de Torcy, his &s;e|cretary
for foreign affairs, to the Hague, with fre&s;h offers,
to which the deputies would make no an&s;wer until they
<PB N="150" REF="156">
knew the &s;entiments of the Queen of Great-Britain. The
Duke of Marlborough cro&s;&s;ed the &s;eas a &s;econd time, ac|companied
by the Lord Vi&s;count Town&s;hend, as am|ba&s;&s;ador
extraordinary, and joint-plenipotentiary: Prince
Eugene being likewi&s;e at the Hague, the conferences were
begun. The French mini&s;ter declared that his ma&s;ter
would con&s;ent to the demolition of Dunkirk: that he
would abandon the Pretender, and di&s;mi&s;s him from his
dominions: that he would acknowledge the Queen's title
and the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion: that he would renounce all
preten&s;ions to the Spani&s;h monarchy, and cede the places
in the Netherlands which the States-General demanded
for their barrier: that he would treat with the Emperor
on the footing of the treaty concluded at Ry&s;wick, and
even demoli&s;h the fortifications of Stra&s;burg. The mi|ni&s;ters
of the allies, rendered proud and wanton by &s;ucce&s;s,
and &s;eeing their own private intere&s;t in the continuation
of the war, in&s;i&s;ted upon the re&s;titution of the Upper and
Lower Al&s;ace to the empire: upon the French monarch's
re&s;toring Stra&s;burg in its pre&s;ent condition: upon his
ceding the town and ca&s;tellany of Li&s;le, demoli&s;hing
Dunkirk, New-Bri&s;ac, Fort-Louis, and Hunningen. In
a word, their demands were &s;o in&s;olent, that Louis would
not have &s;uffered them to be mentioned in his hearing, had
not he been reduced to the la&s;t degree of di&s;tre&s;s. One
can hardly read them without feeling a &s;entiment of com|pa&s;&s;ion
for that monarch, who had once given law to Eu|rope,
and been &s;o long accu&s;tomed to victory and con|que&s;t.
Notwith&s;tanding the di&s;couraging di&s;patches he had
received from the pre&s;ident Rouill&eacute;, after his fir&s;t confer|ences
with the deputies, he could not believe that the
Dutch would be &s;o blind to their own intere&s;t, as to reject
the advantages in commerce, and the barrier which he
had offered. He could not conceive that they would
choo&s;e to bear the burthen of exce&s;&s;ive taxes in pro&s;ecuting
a war, the events of which would always be uncertain,
rather than enjoy the ble&s;&s;ings of peace, &s;ecurity, and ad|vantageous
commerce: he &s;lattered him&s;elf, that the
<PB N="151" REF="157">
allies would not &s;o far deviate from their purpo&s;ed aim of
e&s;tabli&s;hing a balance of power, as to throw &s;uch an enor|mous
weight into the &s;cale of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, which
cheri&s;hed all the dangerous ambition and arbitrary princi|ples,
without the liberality and &s;entiment peculiar to the
hou&s;e of Bourbon. In proportion as they ro&s;e in their de|mands
Louis fell in his conde&s;cen&s;ion. His &s;ecretary of
&s;tate, the Marquis de Torcy, po&s;ted in di&s;gui&s;e to Hol|land,
on the faith of a common blank pa&s;&s;port. He &s;ol|licited,
he &s;oothed, he &s;upplicated, and made conce&s;&s;ions
in the name of his &s;overeign. He found the States were
wholly guided by the influence of Prince Eugene and the
Duke of Marlborough. He found the&s;e generals elated,
haughty, overbearing, and implacable. He in private at|tacked
the Duke of Marlborough on his weake&s;t &s;ide: he
offered to that nobleman a large &s;um of money, provided
he would effect a peace on certain conditions. The pro|po&s;al
was rejected. The Duke found his enemies in Eng|land
increa&s;ing, and his credit at court in the wane; and
he knew that nothing but a continuation of the war, and
new victories, could &s;upport his influence in England.
Torcy was &s;en&s;ible that his country was utterly exhau&s;ted:
that Louis dreaded nothing &s;o much as the opening of the
campaign; and he agreed to tho&s;e articles upon which
they in&s;i&s;ted as preliminaries. The French King was
confounded at the&s;e propo&s;als: he felt the complicated
pangs of grief, &s;hame, and indignation. He rejected the
preliminaries with di&s;dain. He even deigned to &s;ubmit his
conduct to the judgment of his &s;ubjects. His offers were
publi&s;hed, together with the demands of the allies. His
people intere&s;ted them&s;elves in the glory of their monarch.
They exclaimed again&s;t the cruelty and arrogance of his
enemies. Though impoveri&s;hed and half-&s;tarved by the
war, they re&s;olved to expend their whole &s;ub&s;tance in his
&s;upport; and rather to fight his battles without pay, than
leave him in the dire nece&s;&s;ity of complying with &s;uch
di&s;honourable terms. Animated by the&s;e &s;entiments,
they made &s;uch efforts as amazed the whole world. The
<PB N="152" REF="158">
preliminaries being rejected by the French King, Rouill&eacute;
was ordered to quit Holland in four-and-twenty hours; and
the generals of the confederates re&s;olved to open the cam|paign
without further he&s;itation.</P>
<P>&sect; II. Prince Eugene and the Duke of Marlborough
proceeded to Flanders, and towards the end of June the
allied army encamped in the plain of Li&s;le, to the number
of one hundred and ten thou&s;and fighting men. At the
&s;ame time, the Mare&s;chal Villars, accounted the mo&s;t
fortunate general in France, a&s;&s;embled the French forces
in the plain of Lens, where he began to throw up entrench|ments.
The confed&eacute;rate generals having ob&s;erved his
&s;ituation, and perceiving he could not be attacked with any
probability of &s;ucce&s;s, re&s;olved to undertake the &s;iege of
Tournay, the garri&s;on of which Villars had imprudently
weakened. Accordingly, they made a feint upon Ypres,
in order to deceive the enemy, and convert all their atten|tion
to that &s;ide, while they &s;uddenly inve&s;ted Tournay on
the twenty-&s;eventh day of June. Though the garri&s;on
did not exceed twelve weakened battalions, and four &s;qua|drons
of dragoons, the place was &s;o &s;trong, both by art
and nature, and Lieutenant de Surville, the governor, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
&s;uch admirable talents, that the &s;iege was protracted,
contrary to the expectation of the allies, and co&s;t them a
great number of men, notwith&s;tanding all the precautions
that could be taken for the &s;afety of the troops. As the
be&s;iegers proceeded by the method of &s;ap, their miners
frequently met with tho&s;e of the enemy under ground, and
fought with bayonet and pi&s;tol. The volunteers on both
&s;ides pre&s;ented them&s;elves to the&s;e &s;ubterraneous combats,
in the mid&s;t of mines and countermines ready primed for
explo&s;ion. Sometimes they were kindled by accident,
and &s;ometimes &s;prung by de&s;ign; &s;o that great numbers
of tho&s;e brave men were &s;tifled below; and whole batta|lions
blown into the air, or buried in the rubbi&s;h. On
the twenty-eighth day of July, the be&s;iegers having effected
a practicable breach, and made the nece&s;&s;ary di&s;po&s;itions
for a general a&s;&s;ault, the enemy offered to capitulate: the
<PB N="153" REF="159">
town was &s;urrendered upon conditions; and the garri&s;on
retired to the citadel. Surville likewi&s;e entered into a treaty
about giving up the citadel: the articles being &s;ent to the
court of Ver&s;ailles, Louis would not ratify them, except
upon condition that there &s;hould be a general ce&s;&s;ation in
the Netherlands till the fifth day of September. Ho&s;tilities
were renewed on the eighth day of Augu&s;t, and pro&s;ecuted
with uncommon ardour and animo&s;ity. On the thirtieth
Surville de&s;ired to capitulate on certain articles, which
were rejected by the Duke of Marlborough, who gave him
to under&s;tand that he had no terms to expect, but mu&s;t
&s;urrender at di&s;cretion. At length, his provi&s;ion being
quite exhau&s;ted, he was obliged to &s;urrender him&s;elf
and his garri&s;on pri&s;oners of war, though they were per|mitted
to return to France, on giving their parole that
they would not act in the field until a like number of the
allies &s;hould be relea&s;ed.</P>
<P>&sect; III. The next object that attracted the eyes of the
confederates was the city of Mons, which they re&s;olved to
be&s;iege with all po&s;&s;ible expedition. They pa&s;&s;ed the
Schelde on the third day of September, and detached the
Prince of He&s;&s;e to attack the French lines, from the Hai&s;ne
to the Sombre, which were abandoned at his approach.
On the &s;eventh day of September, Mare&s;chal de
Boufflers arrived in the French camp at Quievrain, content
to act in an inferior capacity to Villars, although his &s;u|perior
in point of &s;eniority. The Duke of Marlborough
having received advice that the French were on the march
to attack the advanced body under the Prince of He&s;&s;e,
decamped from Havre, in order to &s;upport that detach|ment.
On the ninth the allies made a motion to the left,
by which the two armies were brought &s;o near each other,
that a mutual cannonading en&s;ued. The French army,
amounting to one hundred and twenty thou&s;and men, were
po&s;ted behind the woods of La Merte and Tanieres, in the
neighbourhood of Malplaquet. The confederates, nearly
of the &s;ame number, encamped with the right near Sart
and Bleron, and the le&s;t on the edge of the wood of Lag|niere;
<PB N="154" REF="160">
the head-quarters being at Blaregnies. The enemy,
in&s;tead of attacking the allies, began to fortify their camp,
which was naturally &s;trong, with triple entrenchments.
In a word, they were &s;o covered with lines, hedges, en|trenchments,
cannon, and trees laid acro&s;s, that they
&s;eemed to be quite inacce&s;&s;ible. Had the confederates at|tacked
them on the ninth, the battle would not have been
&s;o bloody, and the victory would have proved more deci|&s;ive;
for they had not then begun to &s;ecure the camp; but
Marlborough po&s;tponed the engagement until they &s;hould
be re-enforced by eighteen battalions which had been em|ployed
in the &s;iege of Tournay; and, in the mean time,
the French fortified them&s;elves with incredible diligence
and di&s;patch. On the eleventh day of September, early in
the morning, the confederates, favoured by a thick fog,
erected batteries on each wing, and in the centre; and
about eight o'clock, the weather clearing up, the at|tack
began. Eighty-&s;ix battalions on the right, command|ed
by General Schuylemburg, the Duke of Argyle, and
other generals, and &s;upported by two-and-twenty battalion,
under Count Lottum, attacked the left of the enemy with
&s;uch vigour, that, notwith&s;tanding their lines and barri|cadoes,
they were in le&s;s than an hour driven from their
entrenchments, into the woods of Sart and Tanieres.
The Prince of Orange and Baron Fagel, with &s;ix-and-thirty
Dutch battalions, advanced again&s;t the right of the
enemy, po&s;ted in the wood of La Merte, and covered with
three entrenchments. Here the battle was maintained with
the mo&s;t de&s;perate courage on both &s;ides. The Dutch
obliged the French to quit the fir&s;t entrenchment; but were
repul&s;ed from the &s;econd with great &s;laughter. The Prince
of Orange per&s;i&s;ted in his efforts with incredible per&s;eve|rance
and intrepidity, even after two hor&s;es had been kil|led
under him, and the greater part of his officers either
&s;lain or di&s;abled. The French &s;ought with an ob&s;tinacy
of courage that bordered on de&s;pair, till &s;eeing their lines
forced, their left wing and centre giving way, and their
general, Villars, dangerou&s;ly wounded, they made an
<PB N="155" REF="161">
excellent retreat towards Bavay, under the conduct of
Boufflers, and took po&s;t between Que&s;noy and Valen|ciennes.
The field of battle they abandoned to the confede|rates,
with about forty colours and &s;tandards, &s;ixteen pieces
of artillery, and a good number of pri&s;oners; but this was
the deare&s;t victory the allies had ever purcha&s;ed. About
twenty thou&s;and of their be&s;t troops were killed in the
engagement; whereas the enemy did not lo&s;e half the
number, and retired at lei&s;ure, perfectly recovered of that
apprehen&s;ion with which they had been for &s;ome years
in&s;pired and overawed by the &s;ucce&s;&s;es of their adver&s;aries.
On the &s;ide of the allies, Count Lottum, General Tettau,
Count Oxien&s;tern, and the Marquis of Tullibardine were
killed, with many other officers of di&s;tinction. Prince
Eugene was &s;lightly wounded on the head: Lieutenant-General
Webb received a &s;hot in the groin. The Duke
of Argyle, who di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by extraordinary
feats of valour, e&s;caped unhurt; but &s;everal mu&s;ket-balls
penetrated through his clothes, hat, and periwig. In the
French army, the Chevalier de St. George charged twelve
times with the hou&s;ehold troops, and in the la&s;t was
wounded with a &s;word in the arm. The Mare&s;chal de
Villars confidently a&s;&s;erted, that if he him&s;elf had not
been di&s;abled, the confederates would certainly have been
defeated.</P>
<P>&sect; IV. Con&s;idering the &s;ituation of the French, the
number of their troops, and the manner in which they
were fortified, nothing could be more ra&s;h and imprudent
than the attack, which co&s;t the lives of &s;o many gallant
men, and was attended with &s;o little advantage to the con|querors.
Perhaps the Duke of Marlborough thought a vic|tory
was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport his &s;inking intere&s;t
at the court of Great-Britain. His intention was to have
given battle before the enemy had entrenched them&s;elves;
but Prince Eugene in&s;i&s;ted upon delaying the action until
the re-enforcement &s;hould arrive from Tournay. The ex|traordinary
carnage is imputed to the impetuo&s;ity of the
Prince of Orange, who&s;e aim, through this whole war.
<PB N="156" REF="162">
was to rai&s;e him&s;elf into con&s;ideration with the States-General,
by &s;ignal acts of military prowe&s;s. The French
having retired to Valenciennes, the allies were left at
liberty to be&s;iege Mons, which capitulated about the end
of October; and both armies were di&s;tributed in winter-quarters.
The campaign on the Rhine produced nothing
but one &s;harp action, between a detachment of the French
army commanded by the Count de Borgh, and a body of
troops under Count Merci, who had pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine, in
order to penetrate into Franche-comt&eacute;. The Imperial
officer was wor&s;ted in this encounter, with the lo&s;s of two
thou&s;and men; obliged to repa&s;s the river, and retired to
Fribourg. In Piedmont, Velt-Mare&s;chal Thaun com|manded
the confederates, in the room of the Duke of
Savoy, who refu&s;ed to take the field until &s;ome differences
which had ari&s;en between the Emperor and him &s;hould be
adju&s;ted. Thaun's de&s;ign was to be&s;iege Brian&ccedil;on; but
the Duke of Berwick had taken &s;uch precautions as fru|&s;trated
his intention, though part of the troops under the
French general were employed in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing an in&s;ur|rection
of the Cami&s;ars, and other malcontents in the
Vivarez. The&s;e were entirely defeated in a pitched battle;
and Abraham, one of their leaders, being taken, was broke
alive upon the wheel; three-and-twenty were hanged,
and the other pri&s;oners &s;ent to the gallies. The Pope de|layed
acknowledging King Charles, under various pre|tences,
in hope that the campaign would prove favourable
to the Hou&s;e of Bourbon; till at length the Emperor giving
him to under&s;tand that his army &s;hould take up their
winter-quarters in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate, his holine&s;s
&s;olemnly owned Charles as King of Spain, Naples, and
Sicily.</P>
<P>&sect; V. The military operations in Spain and Portugal
were unfavourable to the allies. On the &s;eventh of May,
the Portugue&s;e and Engli&s;h were defeated at Caya, by the
Spaniards under the command of the Mare&s;chal de Bay.
The ca&s;tle of Alicant, guarded by two Engli&s;h regiments,
had been be&s;ieged, and held out during the whole winter.
<PB N="157" REF="163">
At length the Chevalier d'Asfeldt ordered the rock to be
undermined, and having lodged two hundred barrels of
gunpowder, gave Syburg, the governor, to under&s;tand,
that two of his officers might come out and &s;ee the con|dition
of the works. This offer being accepted, A&s;feldt in
per&s;on accompanied them to the mine: he told them he
could not bear the thoughts of &s;eeing &s;o many brave men
peri&s;h in the ruins of a place they had &s;o gallantly de|fended;
and allowed them four-and-twenty hours to con|&s;ider
on the re&s;olution they &s;hould take. Syburg continued
deaf to his remon&s;trances; and, with an ob&s;tinacy that
favoured more of &s;tupidity than of valour, determined to
&s;tand the explo&s;ion. When the &s;entinels that were po&s;ted
on the &s;ide of the hill gave notice, by a preconcerted
&s;ignal, that fire was &s;et to the mine, the governor order|ed
the guard to retire, and walked out to the parade,
accompanied by &s;everal officers. The mine being &s;prung,
the rock opened under their feet, and they falling into the
cha&s;m, it in&s;tantly clo&s;ed, and cru&s;hed them to death.
Notwith&s;tanding this dreadful incident, Colonel d'Albon,
who &s;ucceeded to the command, re&s;olved to defend the
place to the la&s;t extremity. Sir Edward Whitaker &s;ailed
from Barcelona to the relief of the place; but the enemy
had erected &s;uch works as effectually hindered the troops
from landing. Then General Stanhope, who commanded
them, capitulated with the Spani&s;h general for the garri|&s;on,
which marched out with all the honours of war, and
was tran&s;ported to Minorca, where the men were put into
quarters of refre&s;hment. On the frontiers of Catalonia,
General Staremberg maintained his ground, and even an|noyed
the enemy. He pa&s;&s;ed the Segra, and reduced
Balaguer: having left a &s;trong garri&s;on in the place, he
repa&s;&s;ed the river, and &s;ent his forces into winter-quarters.
The mo&s;t remarkable event of this &s;ummer was the
battle of Pultowa, in which the King of Sweden was
entirely defeated by the Czar of Mu&s;covy, and obliged to
take refuge at Bender, a town of Moldavia, in the Turk|i&s;h
dominions. Augu&s;tus immediately marched into
<PB N="158" REF="164">
Poland again&s;t Stani&s;laus, and renounced his own re&s;ig|nation,
as if it had been the effect of compul&s;ion. He
formed a project with the Kings of Denmark and Pru&s;&s;ia,
to attack the Swedi&s;h territories in three different places;
but the Emperor and maritime powers prevented the exe|cution
of this &s;cheme, by entering into a guaranty for
pre&s;erving the peace of the empire. Neverthele&s;s, the
King of Denmark declared war again&s;t Sweden, and
tran&s;ported an army over the Sound to Schonen; but they
were attacked and defeated by the Swedes, and obliged to
re-embark with the utmo&s;t precipitation. The war &s;till
continued to rage in Hungary, where, however, the re|volters
were routed in many petty engagements.</P>
<P>&sect; VI. Though the events of the &s;ummer had been le&s;s
unfavourable to France than Louis had rea&s;on to expect,
he &s;aw that peace was as nece&s;&s;ary as ever to his kingdom;
but he thought he might now treat with &s;ome freedom and
dignity. His mini&s;ter, Torcy, maintained a corre&s;pondence
with Mr. Petkum re&s;ident of the Duke of Hol&s;tein at the
Hague: he propo&s;ed to this mini&s;ter, that the negociation
&s;hould be renewed; and demanded pa&s;&s;es, by virtue of
which the French plenipotentiaries might repair in &s;afety
to Holland. In the mean time, the French King with|drew
his troops from Spain, on pretence of demon&s;trating
his readine&s;s to oblige the allies in that particular; though
this mea&s;ure was the effect of nece&s;&s;ity, which obliged him
to recall tho&s;e troops for the defence of his own dominions.
The States-General refu&s;ed to grant pa&s;&s;es to the French
mini&s;ters; but they allowed Petkum to make a journey to
Ver&s;ailles. In the interim King Philip publi&s;hed a mani|fe&s;to,
prote&s;ting again&s;t all that &s;hould be tran&s;acted at
the Hague to his prejudice. Far from yielding Spain
and the Indies to his competitor, he declared his intention
of driving Charles from tho&s;e places that were now in his
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. He named the Duke of Alba, and Count
Bergheyck for his plenipotentiaries, and ordered them to
notify their credentials to the maritime powers; but no
regard was paid to their intimation. Philip tampered
<PB N="159" REF="165">
likewi&s;e with the Duke of Marlborough; and the Mar|quis
de Torcy renewed his attempts upon that general;
but all his application and addre&s;s proved ineffectual. Pet|kum
brought back from Ver&s;ailles a kind of memorial,
importing, That tho&s;e motives which influenced the
French, before the campaign was opened, no longer &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted:
That the winter &s;ea&s;on naturally produced a ce&s;&s;a|tion
of arms, during which he would treat of a general
and rea&s;onable peace, without re&s;tricting him&s;elf to the
form of the preliminaries which the allies had pretended to
impo&s;e: That, neverthele&s;s, he would &s;till treat on the
foundation of tho&s;e conditions to which he had con&s;ented,
and &s;end plenipotentiaries to begin the conferences with
tho&s;e of the allies, on the fir&s;t day of January. The
States-General inveighed again&s;t this memorial, as a proof
of the French King's in&s;incerity; though he certainly had
a right to retract tho&s;e offers they had formerly rejected.
They came to a re&s;olution, that it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary
to pro&s;ecute the war with vigour; and they wrote
pre&s;&s;ing letters on this &s;ubject to all their allies.</P>
<P>&sect; VII. The parliament of Great-Britain being a&s;&s;em|bled
on the fifteenth day of November, the Queen, in her
&s;peech, told both Hou&s;es, That the enemy had endea|voured,
by fal&s;e appearances, and deceitful in&s;inuations of
a de&s;ire after peace, to create jealou&s;ies among the allies:
That God Almighty had been plea&s;ed to ble&s;s the arms of
the confederates with a mo&s;t remarkable victory, and
other &s;ucce&s;&s;es, which had laid France open to the impre&s;|&s;ion
of the allied arms, and con&s;equently rendered peace
more nece&s;&s;ary to that kingdom than it was at the begin|ning
of the campaign. She in&s;i&s;ted upon the expediency
of pro&s;ecuting the advantages &s;he had gained; by reducing
that exorbitant and oppre&s;&s;ive power which had &s;o long
threatened the liberties of Europe. The parliament were
as eager and compliant as ever. They pre&s;ented con|gratulatory
addre&s;&s;es: they thanked the Duke of Marl|borough
for his &s;ignal &s;ervices; while great part of the
nation reproached him with having wantonly &s;acrificed &s;o
<PB N="160" REF="166">
many thou&s;and lives to his own private intere&s;t and repu|tation.
In le&s;s than a month, the Commons granted up|wards
of &s;ix millions for the &s;ervice of the en&s;uing year;
and e&s;tabli&s;hed a lottery, with other funds, to an&s;wer
this enormous &s;upply. On the thirteenth day of Decem|ber,
Mr. Dolben, &s;on to the late Archbi&s;hop of York,
complained to the Hou&s;e of two &s;ermons preached and
publi&s;hed by Dr. Henry Sacheverel, rector of St. Saviour's,
in Southwark, as containing po&s;itions contrary to Revolu|tion
principles, to the pre&s;ent government, and the pro|te&s;tant
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Sacheveral was a clergyman of narrow
intellects, and an over-heated imagination. He had ac|quired
&s;ome popularity among tho&s;e who di&s;tingui&s;hed
them&s;elves by the name of High-churchmen; and took all
occa&s;ions to vent his animo&s;ity again&s;t the di&s;&s;enters. At
the &s;ummer a&s;&s;izes at Derby, he had held forth in that
&s;train before the judges; on the fifth day of November,
in St. Paul's church, he, in a violent declamation, de|fended
the doctrine of non-re&s;i&s;tance; inveighed again&s;t
the toleration and di&s;&s;enters; declared the church was
dangerou&s;ly attacked by her enemies; and &s;lightly de|fended
by her fal&s;e friends: he &s;ounded the trumpet for
the church, and exhorted the people to put on the whole
armour of God. Sir Samuel Garrard, the lord-mayor,
countenanced this harangue, which was publi&s;hed under his
protection, extolled by the Tories, and circulated all over
the nation. The complaint of Mr. Dolben again&s;t Sache|verel
was &s;econded in the Hou&s;e of Commons by Sir
Peter King, and other members. The mo&s;t violent para|graphs
were read; the &s;ermons were voted &s;candalous and
&s;editious libels. Sacheverel being brought to the bar of
the Hou&s;e, acknowledged him&s;elf the author of both, and
mentioned the encouragement he had received from the
lord mayor to print that which was intituled, &startq;The perils
of fal&s;e brethren.&endq; Sir Samuel, who was a member, de|nied
he had ever given him &s;uch encouragement. The
doctor being ordered to withdraw, the Hou&s;e re&s;olved he
&s;hould be impeached of high crimes and mi&s;demeanours;
<PB N="161" REF="167">
and Mr. Dolben was ordered to impeach him at the bar of the
Hou&s;e of Lords, in the name of all the Commons of Eng|land.
A committee was appointed to draw up articles,
and Sacheverel was taken into cu&s;tody. At the &s;ame time,
in order to demon&s;trate their own principles, they re&s;olved,
That the Reverend Mr. Benjamin Hoadley, rector of St.
Peter's-Poor, for having often ju&s;tified the principles on
which her Maje&s;ty and the nation proceeded in the late
happy revolution, had ju&s;tly merited the favour and re|commendation
of the Hou&s;e; and they pre&s;ented an ad|dre&s;s
to the Queen, be&s;eeching her to be&s;tow &s;ome dignity
in the church on Mr. Hoadley, for his eminent &s;ervices
both to the church and &s;tate. The Queen returned a
civil an&s;wer, though &s;he paid no regard to their recom|mendation.
Hoadley was a clergyman of &s;ound under|&s;tanding,
unblemi&s;hed character, and uncommon mode|ration,
who, in a &s;ermon preached before the Lord-Mayor
of London, had demon&s;trated the lawfulne&s;s of re&s;i&s;ting
wicked and cruel governors; and vindicated the late revo|lution.
By avowing &s;uch doctrines, he incurred the re|&s;entment
of the high-churchmen, who accu&s;ed him of
having preached up rebellion. Many books were written
again&s;t the maxims he profe&s;&s;ed. The&s;e he an&s;wered;
and, in the cour&s;e of the controver&s;y, acquitted him&s;elf
with &s;uperior temper, judgement, and &s;olidity of argu|ment.
He, as well as Bi&s;hop Burnet, and &s;everal other
prelates, had been treated with great virulence in Sache|verel's
&s;ermon; and the Lord-Trea&s;urer was &s;currilou&s;ly
abu&s;ed under the name of Volpene.</P>
<P>&sect; VIII. The doctor being impeached at the bar of the
Upper-Hou&s;e, petitioned that he might be admitted to
bail; but this indulgence was refu&s;ed, and the Commons
&s;eemed bent upon pro&s;ecuting him with &s;uch &s;everity as
gave di&s;gu&s;t to men of moderate principles. Mean while
the Tories were not idle. They boldly affirmed that the
Whigs had formed a de&s;ign to pull down the church;
and that this pro&s;ecution was intended to try their &s;trength,
before they would proceed openly to the execution of their
<PB N="162" REF="168">
project. The&s;e a&s;&s;ertions were &s;upported, and even
credited by great part of the clergy, who did not fail to
alarm and inflame their hearers; while emi&s;&s;aries were em|ployed
to rai&s;e a ferment among the populace, already
prepared with di&s;content, ari&s;ing from a &s;carcity which
prevailed in almo&s;t every country of Europe. The mini|&s;ters
magni$ied the dangers to which the church was ex|po&s;ed,
from di&s;&s;enters, Whigs, and lukewarm prelates.
The&s;e they repre&s;ented as the authors of a ruinous war,
which in a little time would produce univer&s;al &s;amine;
and as the immediate encouragers of tho&s;e Palatine re|fugees
who had been brought over to the number of &s;ix
thou&s;and, and maintained by voluntary contributions
until they could be conveniently tran&s;ported into Ireland,
and the plantations in America. The charity be&s;towed
upon tho&s;e unhappy &s;trangers exa&s;perated the poor of Eng|land,
who felt &s;everely the effects of the dearth, and
helped to fill up the mea&s;ure of popular di&s;content. The
articles again&s;t Dr. Sacheverel being exhibited, his per&s;on
was committed to the deputy-u&s;her of the black-rod; but,
afterwards, the Lords admitted him to bail. Then he
drew up an an&s;wer to the charge, in which he denied &s;ome
articles, and others he endeavoured to ju&s;tify or extenuate.
The Commons having &s;ent up a replication, declaring
they were ready to prove the charge, the Lords appointed
the twenty-&s;eventh day of February for the trial, in We&s;t|min&s;ter-hall.</P>
<P>&sect; IX. The eyes of the whole kingdom were turned upon
this extraordinary trial. It la&s;ted three weeks, during
which all other bu&s;ine&s;s was &s;u&s;pended; and the Queen her|&s;elf
was every day pre&s;ent, though in quality of a private
&s;pectator. The managers for the Commons were Sir
Jo&s;eph Jekyl, Mr. Eyre, Sollicitor-General, Sir P$$er
King, recorder of the city of London, Lieutenant-General
Stanhope, Sir Thomas Parker, and Mr. Robert Walpole,
trea&s;urer of the navy. The doctor was defended by Sir
Simon Harcourt and Mr. Phipps, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Dr. At|terbury,
Dr. Smallridge, and Dr. Friend. A va&s;t multi|tude
<PB N="163" REF="169">
attended him every day to and from We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall,
&s;triving to ki&s;s his hand, and praying for his deliverance,
as if he had been a martyr and confe&s;&s;or. The Queen's
&s;edan was be&s;et by the populace, exclaiming, &startq;God
ble&s;s your Maje&s;ty and the church. We hope your
Maje&s;ty is for Dr. Sacheverel.&endq; They compelled all
per&s;ons to lift their hats to the doctor, as he pa&s;&s;ed in his
coach to the Temple, where he lodged; and among the&s;e
&s;ome members of parliament, who were abu&s;ed and in&s;ulted.
They de&s;troyed &s;everal meeting-hou&s;es; plundered the
dwelling-hou&s;es of eminent di&s;&s;enters; and threatened to
pull down tho&s;e of the Lord-Chancellor, the Earl of
Wharton, and the Bi&s;hop of Sarum. They even pro|po&s;ed
to attack the Bank; &s;o that the directors were
obliged to &s;end to Whitehall for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The hor&s;e and
foot guards were immediately &s;ent to di&s;per&s;e the rioters,
who fled at their approach. Next day the guards were
doubled at Whitehall, and the trained-bands of We&s;t|min&s;ter
continued in arms during the whole trial. The
Commons entreated the Queen, in an addre&s;s, to take
effectual mea&s;ures for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the pre&s;ent tumults, &s;et
on foot and fomented by papi&s;ts, nonjurors, and other
enemies to her title and government. She expre&s;&s;ed a
deep &s;en&s;e of their care and concern, as well as a ju&s;t re|&s;entment
at the&s;e tumultuous and violent proceedings. She
publi&s;hed a proclamation for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the tumults; and
&s;everal per&s;ons being apprehended, were afterwards tried for
high-trea&s;on. Two of them were convicted, and &s;entenced to
die; but neither &s;uffered. The Commons pre&s;ented another
addre&s;s of thanks to her Maje&s;ty, for her gracious an&s;wer to
their fir&s;t remon&s;trance. They took this occa&s;ion to de|clare,
that the pro&s;ecution of the Commons again&s;t Dr.
Henry Sacheverel proceeded only from the indi&s;pen&s;able
obligation they lay under to vindicate the late happy revo|lution,
the glory of their royal deliverer, her own title
and admini&s;tration, the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment and prote&s;tant
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion, together with the toleration and the quiet of
the government. When the doctor's coun&s;el had fini&s;hed
<PB N="164" REF="170">
his defence, he him&s;elf recited a &s;peech, wherein he &s;o|lemnly
ju&s;tified his intentions towards the Queen and her
government; and &s;poke in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful terms of
the Revolution, and the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. He main|tained
the doctrine of non-re&s;i&s;tance in all ca&s;es what&s;oever,
as a maxim of the church in which he was educated; and
by many pathetical expre&s;&s;ions endeavoured to excite the
compa&s;&s;ion of the audience. He was &s;urrounded by the
Queen's chaplains, who encouraged and extolled him as
the champion of the church; and he was privately favoured
by the Queen her&s;elf, who could not but reli&s;h a doctrine
&s;o well calculated for the &s;upport of regal authority.</P>
<P>&sect; X. On the tenth day of March, the Lords being ad|journed
to their own hou&s;e, the Earl of Nottingham pro|po&s;ed
the following que&s;tion, &startq;Whether, in pro&s;ecutions
by impeachments for high crimes and mi&s;demeanours,
by writing or &s;peaking, the particular words &s;uppo&s;ed
to be criminal are nece&s;&s;ary to be expre&s;sly &s;pecified in
&s;uch impeachments?&endq; The judges being con&s;ulted,
were unanimou&s;ly of opinion, that, according to law, the
grounds of an indictment or impeachment ought to be
expre&s;sly mentioned in both. One of the lords having
&s;ugge&s;ted, that the judges had delivered their opinions
according to the rules of We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, and not ac|cording
to the u&s;age of parliament, the Hen&s;e re&s;olved,
that in impeachments they &s;hould proceed according to the
laws of the land, and the law and u&s;age of parliaments.
On the &s;ixteenth day of the month, the Queen being in
the Hou&s;e incognito, they proceeded to con&s;ider whether
or not the Commons had made good the articles exhibited
again&s;t Dr. Sacheverel. The Earl of Wharton ob&s;erved,
that the doctor's &s;peech was a full confutation and con|demnation
of his &s;ermon: that all he had advanced about
non-re&s;i&s;tance and unlimited obedience was fal&s;e and ridi|culous:
that the doctrine of pa&s;&s;ive obedience, as urged by
the doctor, was not reconcileable to the practice of church|men:
that if the Revolution was not lawful, many in that
Hou&s;e, and va&s;t numbers without, were guilty of blood,
<PB N="165" REF="171">
murther, rapine, and inju&s;tice; and that the Queen her|&s;elf
was no lawful &s;overeign, &s;ince the be&s;t title &s;he had
to the crown, was her parliamentary title, founded
upon the Revolution. He was an&s;wered by the
Lord Haver&s;ham in a long &s;peech. Lord Ferrers &s;aid,
if the doctor was guilty of &s;ome fooli&s;h unguarded expre&s;|&s;ions,
he ought to have been tried at common law. The
Earl of Scarborough ob&s;erved, the Revolution was a nice
point, and above the law: he moved that they &s;hould
adjourn the debate, and take time to con&s;ider before they
gave judgement. Doctor Hooper, Bi&s;hop of Bath and
Wells, allowed the nece&s;&s;ity and legality of re&s;i&s;tance in
&s;ome extraordinary ca&s;es; but was of opinion, that this
maxim ought to be concealed from the knowledge of the
people, who are naturally too apt to re&s;i&s;t that the Revo|lution
was not to be boa&s;ted of, nor made a precedent:
but that a mantle ought to be thrown over it, and it &s;hould
be called a vacancy or abdication. He &s;aid the original
compact were dangerous words, not to be mentioned with|out
great caution: that tho&s;e who examined the Revolution
too nicely were no friends to it; and that there &s;eemed
to be a nece&s;&s;ity for preaching up non-re&s;i&s;tance and
pa&s;&s;ive obedience at that time, when re&s;i&s;tance was ju&s;tified.
The Duke of Argyle affirmed, that the clergy in all ages
had delivered up the rights and privileges of the people,
preaching up the King's power, in order to govern him
the more ea&s;ily; and, therefore, they ought not to be &s;uffer|ed
to meddle with politicks. The Earl of Angle&s;ey owned
the doctor had preached non&s;en&s;e; but &s;aid that was no
crime. The Duke of Leeds di&s;tingui&s;hed between re&s;i&s;t|ance
and revolution; for, had not the la&s;t &s;ucceeded, it
would have certainly been rebellion, &s;ince he know of no
other but hereditary right. The Bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury ju&s;ti|fied
re&s;i&s;tance from the book of Maccabees: he mentioned
the conduct of Queen Eli&s;abeth, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Scots,
the French, and the States-General, in re&s;i&s;ting their
different &s;overeigns, and was &s;upported in this practice
both by her parliaments and her convocations. He ob&s;erved
<PB N="166" REF="172">
that King Charles I. had a&s;&s;i&s;ted the citizens of Rochelle
in their rebellion: that Manwaring incurred a &s;evere cen|&s;ure
from the parliament, for having broached the doctrine
of the divine right of kings; and that though this became
a favourite maxim after the re&s;toration, yet its warme&s;t
a&s;&s;erters were the fir&s;t who pleaded for re&s;i&s;tance when they
thought them&s;elves oppre&s;&s;ed. The Archbi&s;hop of York,
the Duke of Buckingham, and other leaders of the Tory
intere&s;t, declared that they never read &s;uch a piece of mad|ne&s;s
and non&s;en&s;e as Sacheverel's &s;ermon; but they did
not think him guilty of a mi&s;demeanour. Next day, Dr.
Wake, Bi&s;hop of Lincoln, accu&s;ed Sacheverel of having
made a &s;trange and fal&s;e repre&s;entation of the de&s;ign for a
comprehen&s;ion, which had been &s;et on foot by Archbi&s;hop
Sancroft, and promoted by the mo&s;t eminent divines of
the church of England. He was of opinion that &s;ome &s;tep
&s;hould be taken for putting a &s;top to &s;uch preaching,
as, if not timely corrected, might kindle heats and ani|mo&s;ities
that would endanger both church and &s;tate. Dr.
Trimnel, Bi&s;hop of Norwich, expatiated upon the in&s;olence
of Sacheverel, who had arraigned Archbi&s;hop Grindal, one
of the eminent reformers, as a per&s;idious prelate, for
having favoured and tolerated the di&s;cipline of Geneva.
He enlarged upon the good effects of the toleration. He
took notice of Sacheverel's pre&s;umption in publi&s;hing in|flammatory
prayers, declaring him&s;elf under per&s;ecution,
while he was pro&s;ecuted for offending again&s;t the law, by
tho&s;e who in common ju&s;tice ought to be thought the
faire&s;t accu&s;ers, and before their lord&s;hips, who were ju&s;tly
acknowledged to be the mo&s;t impartial judges. In di&s;|cu&s;&s;ing
the fourth article, the Bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury &s;poke
with great vehemence again&s;t Sacheverel, who, by in|veighing
again&s;t the Revolution, toleration, and union,
&s;eemed to arraign and attack the Queen her&s;elf; &s;ince her
Maje&s;ty had &s;o great a &s;hare in the fir&s;t; had often declared
&s;he would maintain the &s;econd; and that &s;he looked upon
the third as the mo&s;t glorious event of her reign. He
affirmed that nothing could be more plain than the $word$
<PB N="167" REF="173">
reflecting upon her Maje&s;ty's mini&s;ters; and that he had
&s;o well marked out a noble peer there pre&s;ent, by an ugly
and &s;currilous epither which he would not repeat, that
it was not po&s;&s;ible to mi&s;take his meaning. Some of the
younger peers could not help laughing at this unde&s;igned
&s;arca&s;m upon the Lord-Trea&s;urer, whom Sacheverel had re|viled
under the name of Volpone: they exclaimed, &startq;Name
him, name him;&endq; and, in all probability, the zealous
bi&s;hop, who was remarkable for ab&s;ence of mind and un|guarded
expre&s;&s;ions, would have gratified their reque&s;t, had
not the Chancellor, interpo&s;ing, declared that no peer was
obliged to &s;ay more than he &s;hould think proper.</P>
<P>&sect; XI. After ob&s;tinate di&s;putes, and much virulent alter|cation,
Sacheverel was found guilty by a majority of &s;even|teen
voices; and four-and-thirty peers entered a prote&s;t
again&s;t this deci&s;ion. He was prohibited from preaching for
the term of three years; his two &s;ermons were ordered to be
burnt by the hands of the common hangman, in pre&s;ence of
the Lord-Mayor and the two &s;heriffs of London and Mid|dle&s;ex.
The Lords likewi&s;e voted that the executioner
&s;hould commit to the &s;ame fire the famous decree pa&s;&s;ed in
the convocation of the univer&s;ity of Oxford, a&s;&s;erting the
ab&s;olute authority and indefea&s;ible right of princes. A
like &s;entence was denounced by the Commons upon a book
intituled, &startq;Collections of pa&s;&s;ages referred to by Dr. Sa|cheverel,
in his an&s;wer to the articles of impeachment.&endq;
The&s;e he had &s;elected from pious books lately publi&s;hed,
and they were read by his coun&s;el, as proofs that the church
was in danger. The lenity of the &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed upon
Sacheverel, which was in a great mea&s;ure owing to the dread
of popular re&s;entment, his friends con&s;idered as a victory
obtained over a Whig faction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1710.</NOTE> and they celebrated their
triumph with bon&s;ires and illuminations.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bu$net.</NOTE> On the fifth day
of April,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hare.</NOTE> the Queen ordered the parliament to be pro|rogued,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Torcy.</NOTE>

her concern for the nece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ion which had taken
up great part of their time towards the latter end of the
&s;e&s;&s;ion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi&s;t. of the D. of Marl|borough. Tindal. Voltane.</NOTE> She declared that no prince could have a more true

church than &s;he had,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK I. 1710.</NOTE> and &s;hould always have; and &s;he
&s;aid it was very injurious to take a pretence from wicked
and malicious libels, to in&s;inuate that the church was in
danger by her admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>&sect; XII. The French King, &s;eeing the mi&s;ery of his people
daily increa&s;e, and all his re&s;ources fail, humbled him&s;elf
again before the allies, and by the means of Petkurn, who
&s;till corre&s;ponded with his mini&s;ters, implored the States-General,
that the negociation might be re&s;umed. In order
to facilitate their con&s;ent, he di&s;patched a new project of
pacification, in which he promi&s;ed to renounce his grand|&s;on,
and to comply with all their other demands, provided
the Electors of Cologn and Bavaria &s;hould be re-e&s;tabli&s;h|ed
in their e&s;tates and dignities. The&s;e overtures being
rejected, another plan was offered, and communicated to
the plenipotentiaries of the Emperor and Queen of Great-Britain.
Then Petkum wrote a letter to the Marquis de
Torcy, intimating, that the allies required his mo&s;t Chri|&s;tian
Maje&s;ty &s;hould declare, in plain and expre&s;&s;ive terms,
that he con&s;ented to all the preliminaries, except the thirty-&s;eventh
article, which &s;tipulated a ce&s;&s;ation of arms, in
ca&s;e the Spani&s;h monarchy &s;hould be delivered to King
Charles in the &s;pace of two months. He &s;aid, the allie,
would &s;end pa&s;&s;ports to the French mini&s;ters, to treat of
an equivalent for that article. Louis was even forced to
&s;wallow this bitter draught. He &s;ignified his con&s;ent, and
appointed the Mare&s;chal D'Uxelles and the Abb&eacute; Po|lignae
his plenipotentiaries. They were not &s;uffered,
however, to enter Holland, but were met by the Deputies
Buys and Vanderdu&s;&s;en at Gertruydenberg. Mean while,
the States de&s;ired the Queen of England to &s;end over the
Duke of Marlborough, to a&s;&s;i&s;t them with his advice in
the&s;e conferences. The two Hou&s;es of parliament &s;econd|ed
their reque&s;t in a joint addre&s;s to her Maje&s;ty, who told
them &s;he had already given directions for his departure:
and &s;aid &s;he was glad to find they concurred with her in a
ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the Duke's eminent &s;ervices. Both the letter
<PB N="169" REF="175">
and the addre&s;s were procured by the intere&s;t o$ Marlbo|rough,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. X. 1710.</NOTE>
to let the Queen &s;ee how much that nobleman was
con&s;idered both at home and abroad. But &s;he was already
wholly alienated from him in her heart, and the&s;e expedi|ents
&s;erved only to increa&s;e her di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>&sect; XIII. The French mini&s;ters were &s;ubjected to every
&s;pecies of mortification. They were in a manner con|fined
to a &s;mall fortified town, and all their conduct
narrowly watched. Their accommodation was mean:
their letters were opened; and they were daily in&s;ulted
by injurious libels. The Dutch deputies would hear of
no relaxation, and no expedient for removing the di&s;&s;i|culties
that retarded the negociation. In vain the pleni|potentiaries
declared, that the French King could not
with decency, or the lea&s;t regard to his honour, wage
war again&s;t his own grand&s;on: the deputies in&s;i&s;ted upon
his effecting the ce&s;&s;ion of Sapin and the Indies to the hou&s;e
of Au&s;tria; and &s;ubmitting to every other article &s;pecified
in the preliminaries. Nay, they even re&s;erved to them|&s;elves
a power of making ulterior demands after the pre|liminaries
&s;hould be adju&s;ted. Louis propo&s;ed that &s;ome
&s;mall provi&s;ion &s;hould be made for the Duke of Anjou,
which might induce him to relinqui&s;h Spain the more ea&s;ily.
He mentioned the kingdom of Arragon; and this hint
being di&s;agreeable to the allies, he demanded Naples and
Sicily. When they urged that Naples was already in
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, he re&s;tricted the pro|vi&s;ion
to Sicily and Sardinia. He offered to deliver up
four cautionary towns in Flanders, as a &s;ecurity for Philip's
evacuating Spain; and even promi&s;ed to &s;upply the con|federates
with a monthly &s;um of money, to de&s;ray the
expen&s;e of expelling that prince from his dominions,
&s;hould he refu&s;e to re&s;ign them with a good grace. The
&s;ub&s;tance of all the conferences was communicated to
Lord Town&s;hend, and Count Zinzendor&s;, the Imperial
plenipotentiary; but the conduct of the deputies was re|gulated
by the Pen&s;ionary Hein&s;ius, who was firmly at|tached
to Prince Eugene and the Duke of Marlborough,
<PB N="170" REF="176">
more aver&s;e than ever to a pacification. The negociatio$
la&s;ted from the nineteenth day of March to the twenty
fifth of July, during which term the conferences we$$
&s;everal times interrupted, and a great many di&s;patches and
new propo&s;als arrived from Ver&s;ailles. At length, the ple|nipotentiaries
returned to France, after having &s;ent a letter
to the Pen&s;ionary, in which they declared, that the pro|po&s;als
made by the deputies were unju&s;t and impracticable;
and complained of the unworthy treatment to which they
had been expo&s;ed. Louis re&s;olved to hazard another cam|paign,
not without hope, that there might be &s;ome lucky
incidents in the events of war, and that the approaching
revolution in the Engli&s;h mini&s;try, of which he was well
appri&s;ed, would be productive of a more rea&s;onable paci|fication.
The States-General re&s;olved, That the enemy
had departed from the foundation on which the negoci|ation
had begun, and &s;tudied pretences to evade the exe|cution
of the capital points, the re&s;titution of Spain and
the Indies; and, in &s;hort, that France had no other view
than to &s;ow and create jealou&s;y and di&s;union among the
allies. Lord Town&s;hend, in a memorial, a&s;&s;ured them, that
the Queen entirely approved their re&s;olution, and all the
&s;teps they had taken in the cour&s;e of the negociation;
and that &s;he was firmly re&s;olved to pro&s;ecute the war with
all po&s;&s;ible vigour, until the enemy &s;hould accept &s;uch
terms of peace as might &s;ecure the tranquillity of the
Chri&s;tian world.</P>
<P>&sect; XIV. The conferences did not retard the operations
of the campaign. Prince Eugene and the Duke of Marl|borough
&s;et out from the Hague on the fifteenth day of
March for Tournay, in order to a&s;&s;emble the forces which
were quartered on the Mae&s;e, in Flanders, and B$abant.
On the twentieth of April, they &s;uddenly advanced to
Font-a-Vendin, in order to attack the lines upon which
the French had been at work all the winter, hoping by
the&s;e to cover Douay and other frontier towns, which were
threatened by the con&s;ederates. The troops left for the
defence of the lines retired without oppo&s;ition. The allies
<PB N="171" REF="177">
having laid bridges over the Scarpe, the Duke of Marl|borough
with his divi&s;ion pa&s;&s;ed that river, and encamped
at Vitri. Prince Eugene remained on the other &s;ide, and
inve&s;ted Douay, the enemy retiring towards Cambray.
Mare&s;chal Villars &s;till commanded the French army,
which was extremely numerous and well appointed, con|&s;idering
the di&s;tre&s;s of that kingdom. Indeed, the number
was augmented by this di&s;tre&s;s; for many thou&s;ands &s;aved
them&s;elves from dying of hunger, by carrying arms in the
&s;ervice. The mare&s;chal having a&s;&s;embled all his forces,
pa&s;&s;ed the Schelde, and encamped at Boucham, declaring
that he would give battle to the confederates; an alteration
was immediately made in the di&s;po&s;ition of the allies, and
proper precautions taken for his reception. He advanced
in order of battle; but having viewed the &s;ituation of
the confederates, he marched back to the heights of St.
Laurence, where he fixed his camp. His aim was by
continual alarms to interrupt the &s;iege of Douay, which
was vigorou&s;ly defended by a numerous garri&s;on, under the
command of Mon&s;ieur Albergotti, who made a number of
&s;ucce&s;sful &s;allies, in which the be&s;iegers lo&s;t a great num|ber
of men. They were likewi&s;e repul&s;ed in &s;everal
a&s;&s;aults; but &s;till proceeded with unremitting vigour,
until the be&s;ieged being reduced to the la&s;t extremity, were
obliged to capitulate on the twenty-&s;ixth of June, fifty
days after the trenches had been opened. The generals
finding it impracticable to attack the enemy, who were
po&s;ted with &s;trong lines from Arras towards Miramont,
re&s;olved to be&s;iege Bethune, which was inve&s;ted on the
fifteenth day of July, and &s;urrendered on the twenty-ninth
of Augu&s;t. Villars marched out of his entrenchments
with a view to rai&s;e the &s;iege; but he did not think proper
to hazard an engagement: &s;ome warm &s;kirmi&s;hes, however,
happened between the &s;oragers of the two armies. After
the reduction of Bethune, the allies be&s;ieged at one time
the towns of Aire and St. Venant, which were taken
without much difficulty. Then the armies broke up, and
marched into winter-quarters.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="178">
&sect; XV. The campaign on the Rhine was productive of
no military event: nor was any thing of con&s;equence
tran&s;acted at Piedmont. The Duke of Savoy being in|di&s;po&s;ed
and out of humour, the command of the forces
&s;till continued ve&s;ted in Count Thaun, who endeavoured
to pa&s;s the Alps, and penetrate into Dauphin&eacute;; but the
Duke of Berwick had ca&s;t up entrenchments in the moun|tains,
and taken &s;uch precautions to guard them, as
ba&s;&s;led all the attempts of the Imperial general. Spain
was much more fruitful of military incidents. The hor&s;e
and dragoons in the army of King Charles, headed by
General Stanhope, attacked the whole cavalry of the ene|my
at Almennara. Stanhope charged in per&s;on, and with
his own hand &s;lew General Ame&s;&s;aga, who commanded
the guards of Philip. The Spani&s;h hor&s;e were entirely
routed, together with nine battalions that e&s;caped by
favour of the darkne&s;s; and the main body of the army
retired with precipitation to Lerida. General Starem|berg
pur&s;ued them to Sarago&s;&s;a, where he found them
drawn up in order of battle; and an engagement en&s;uing
on the ninth day of Augu&s;t, the enemy were totally defeat|ed:
five thou&s;and of their men were killed, &s;even thou&s;and
taken, together with all their artillery, and a great number
of colours and &s;tandards. King Charles entered Sara|go&s;&s;a
in triumph, while Philip with the wreck of his army
retreated to Madrid. Having &s;ent his Queen and &s;on to
Victoria, he retired to Valladolid, in, order to collect his
&s;cattered troops, &s;o as to form another army. The good
fortune of Charles was of &s;hort duration. Stanhope pro|po&s;ed
that he &s;hould immediately &s;ecure Pampeluna, the
only pa&s;s by which the French King could &s;end troops to
Spain: but this &s;alutary &s;cheme was rejected. King
Charles proceeded to Madrid, which was de&s;erted by all
the grandees; and he had the mortification to &s;ee that the
Ca&s;tilians were univer&s;ally attached to his competitor.</P>
<P>&sect; XVI. While his forces continued cantoned in the
neighbourhood of Toledo, the King of France, at the
reque&s;t of Philip, &s;ent the Duke de Vendome to take the
<PB N="173" REF="179">
command of the Spani&s;h army, which was at the &s;ame
time re-enforced by detachments of French troops. Ven|dome's
reputation was &s;o high, and his per&s;on &s;o beloved
by the &s;oldiery, that his pre&s;ence was almo&s;t equivalent
to an army. A great number of volunteers immediately
a&s;&s;embled to &s;ignalize them&s;elves under the eye of this
renowned general. The Ca&s;tilians were in&s;pired with
fre&s;h courage, and made &s;urpri&s;ing efforts in favour of
their &s;overeign; &s;o that in le&s;s than three months after his
defeat at Sarago&s;&s;a, he was in a condition to go in que&s;t
of his rival. Charles, on the other hand, was totally ne|glected
by the courts of Vienna and Great-Britain, which
took no &s;teps to &s;upply his wants, or enable him to pro&s;e|cute
the advantages he had gained. In the beginning of
November his army marched back to Sarago&s;&s;a, and was
cantoned in the neighbourhood of Cifuentes, where
Staremberg e&s;tabli&s;hed his head-quarters. General Stan|hope,
with the Briti&s;h forces, was quartered in the little
town of Brihuega, where, on the twenty-&s;eventh day of
the month, he found him&s;elf &s;uddenly &s;urrounded by the
whole Spani&s;h army. As the place was not tenable, and
he had very little ammunition, he was obliged, after a
&s;hort but vigorous re&s;i&s;tance, to capitulate, and &s;urrender
him&s;elf and all his forces pri&s;oners of war, to the amount
of two thou&s;and men, including three lieutenant-generals,
one major-general, one brigadier, with all the colonels and
officers of the re&s;pective regiments. He was greatly cen|&s;ured
for having allowed him&s;elf to be &s;urpri&s;ed; for, if
he had placed a guard upon the neighbouring hills, ac|cording
to the advice of General Carpenter, he might have
received notice of the enemy's approach time enough to
retire to Cifuentes. Thither he had detached his aide-du|camp
wito an account of his &s;ituation, on the appearance
of the Spani&s;h army; and Staremberg immediately a&s;|&s;embled
his forces. About eleven in the forenoon they
began to march towards Brihuega; but the roads were &s;o
bad, that night overtook them before they reached the
heights in the neighbourhood of that place. Staremberg
<PB N="174" REF="180">
is &s;aid to have loitered away his time unnece&s;&s;arily, from
motives of envy to the Engli&s;h general, who had &s;urren|dered
before his arrival. The troops lay all night on their
arms near Villa-vicio&s;a, and on the twenty-ninth were
attacked by the enemy, who doubled their number. Sta|remberg's
le&s;t wing was utterly defeated, all the infantry
that compo&s;ed it having been either cut in pieces or, taken:
but the victors, in&s;tead of following the blow, began to
plunder the baggage; and Staremberg with his right wing
fought their left with &s;urpri&s;ing valour and per&s;everance
till night. Then they retired in di&s;order, leaving him
ma&s;ter of the field of battle and of all their artillery. Six
thou&s;and of the enemy were killed on the &s;pot; but the
allies had &s;uffered &s;o &s;everely that the general could not
maintain his ground. He ordered the cannon to be nailed
up, and marched to Sarago&s;&s;a, from whence he retired to
Catalonia. Thither he was pur&s;ued by the Duke de
Vendome, who reduced Balaguer, in which he had left
a garri&s;on, and compelled him to take &s;helter under the
walls of Barcelona. At this period the Duke de Noailles
inve&s;ted Gironne, which he reduced, notwith&s;tanding the
&s;everity of the weather: &s;o that Philip, from a fugitive, be|came
in three months ab&s;olute ma&s;ter of the whole Spani&s;h
monarchy, except the province of Catalonia, and even
that lay open to his incur&s;ions. Nothing of con&s;equence
was atchieved on the &s;ide of Portugal, from whence the
Earl of Galway returned to England by the Queen's per|mi&s;&s;ion.
The operations of the Briti&s;h fleet, during this
&s;ummer, were &s;o incon&s;iderable as &s;carce to de&s;erve notice.
Sir John Norris commanded in the Mediterranean, and
with a view to &s;upport the Cami&s;ars, who were in arms in
the Cevennes, &s;ailed to port Cette, within a league of Mar|&s;eilles,
and at the di&s;tance of fifteen from the in&s;urgents.
The place &s;urrendered, without oppo&s;ition, to about &s;even
hundred men that landed under the command of Major-General
Sai&s;&s;an, a native of Languedoc. He likewi&s;e made
him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the town and ca&s;tle of Ayde; but the
<PB N="175" REF="181">
Duke de Noailles advancing with a body of forces to
join the Duke de Roquelaire, who commanded in tho&s;e
parts, the Engli&s;h abandoned their conque&s;ts, and re-em|barked
with precipitation. After the battle of Pultowa
the Czar of Mu&s;covy reduced all Livonia; but he and
King Augu&s;tus agreed to a neutrality for Pomerania.
The King of Sweden continued at Bender, and the Grand
Signor intere&s;ted him&s;elf &s;o much in behalf of that prince,
as to declare war again&s;t the Emperor of Ru&s;&s;ia. Ho&s;tili|ties
were carried on between the Swedi&s;h and Dani&s;h fleets
with various &s;ucce&s;s. The malcontents in Hungary &s;u|&s;tained
repeated lo&s;&s;es during the &s;ummer; but they were
encouraged to maintain the war by the rupture between
the Ottoman Porte and Ru&s;&s;ia. They were flattered with
hopes of auxiliaries from the Turks; and expected engi|neers
and money from the French monarch.</P>
<P>&sect; XVII. In England, the effects of tho&s;e intrigues
which had been formed again&s;t the Whig mini&s;ters began
to appear. The trial of Sacheverel had excited a popular
&s;pirit of aver&s;ion to tho&s;e who favoured the di&s;&s;enters.
From all parts of the kingdom addre&s;&s;es were pre&s;ented to
the Queen, cen&s;uring all re&s;i&s;tance as a rebellious doctrine,
founded upon antimonarchical and republican principles.
At the &s;ame time counter addre&s;&s;es were procured by the
Whigs, extolling the Revolution, and magnifying the con|duct
of the pre&s;ent parliament. The Queen began to ex|pre&s;s
her attachment to the Tories, by mortifying the
Duke of Marlborough. Upon the death of the Earl of
E&s;&s;ex &s;he wrote to the General, de&s;iring that the regi|ment
which had been commanded by that nobleman
&s;hould be given to Mr. Hill, brother to Mrs. Ma&s;ham, who
had &s;upplanted the Duche&s;s of Marlborough in the Queen's
friend&s;hip, and was in effect the &s;ource of this political
revolution. The Duke repre&s;ented to her Maje&s;ty, in
per&s;on, the prejudice that would redound to the &s;ervice
from the promotion of &s;uch a young officer over the heads
of a great many brave men, who had exhibited repeated
proofs of valour and capacity. He expo&s;tulated with his
<PB N="176" REF="182">
&s;overeign on this extraordinary mark of partial regard to
the brother of Mrs. Ma&s;ham, which he could not help con|&s;idering
as a declaration again&s;t him&s;elf and his family,
who had &s;o much cau&s;e to complain of that lady's malice
and ingratitude. To this remon&s;trance the Queen made no
other reply, but that he would do well to con&s;ult his friends.
The Earl of Godolphin enforced his friend's arguments,
though without effect; and the Duke retired in di&s;gu&s;t to
Wind&s;or. The Queen appeared at council without taking
the lea&s;t notice of his ab&s;ence, which did not fail to alarm
the whole Whig faction. Several noblemen ventured to
&s;peak to her Maje&s;ty on the &s;ubject, and explain the bad
con&s;equences of di&s;obliging a man who had done &s;uch emi|nent
&s;ervices to the nation. She told them his &s;ervices
were &s;till fre&s;h in her memory; and that &s;he retained all
her former kindne&s;s for his per&s;on. Hearing, however,
that a popular clamour was rai&s;ed, and that the Hou&s;e of
Commons intended to pa&s;s &s;ome votes that would be di&s;|agreeable
to her and her new coun&s;ellors, &s;he ordered the
Earl of Godolphin to write to the Duke, to di&s;po&s;e of the
regiment as he &s;hould think proper, and return to town
immediately. Before he received this intimation he had
&s;ent a letter to the Queen, de&s;iring &s;he would permit him
to retire from bu&s;ine&s;s. In an&s;wer to this petition, &s;he
a&s;&s;ured him his &s;u&s;picions were groundle&s;s, and in&s;i&s;ted
upon his coming to council. The Duche&s;s demanded an
audience of her Maje&s;ty, on pretence of vindicating her
own character from &s;ome a&s;per&s;ions. She hoped to work
upon the Queen's tenderne&s;s, and retrieve the influence
&s;he had lo&s;t. She prote&s;ted, argued, wept, and &s;uppli|cated:
but the Queen was too well plea&s;ed with her own
deliverance from the tyranny of the other's friend&s;hip, to
incur &s;uch &s;lavery for the future. All the humiliation of
the Duche&s;s &s;erved only to render her&s;elf the more con|temptible.
The Queen heard her without exhibiting the
lea&s;t &s;ign of emotion, and all &s;he would vouch&s;afe, was a
repetition of the&s;e words, &startq;You de&s;ired no an&s;wer, and
you &s;hall have none:&endq; alluding to an expre&s;&s;ion in a
<PB N="177" REF="183">
letter &s;he had received from the duche&s;s. As an addi|tional
mortification to the mini&s;try, the office of lord|chamberlain
was transferred from the Duke of Kent to
the Duke of Shrew&s;bury, who had lately voted with the
Tories, and maintained an intimacy of corre&s;pondence
with Mr. Harley. The intere&s;t of the Duke of Marlbo|rough
was not even &s;ufficient to prevent the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of
his own &s;on-in-law, the Earl of Sunderland, from the
po&s;t of &s;ecretary of &s;tate, in which he was &s;ucceeded by
Lord Dartmouth.</P>
<P>&sect; XVIII. The Queen was generally applauded for
thus a&s;&s;erting her ju&s;t prerogative, and &s;etting her&s;elf free
from an arbitrary cabal, by which &s;he had been &s;o long
kept in dependence. The Duke of Beaufort went to court
on this occa&s;ion, and told her Maje&s;ty, he was extremely
glad that he could now &s;alute her Queen in reality. The
whole Whig party were ju&s;tly alarmed at the&s;e alterations.
The directors of the bank repre&s;ented to her Maje&s;ty the
prejudice that would undoubtedly accrue to public credit
from a change of the mini&s;try. The Emperor and the
States-General interpo&s;ed in this dome&s;tic revolution.
Their mini&s;ters at London pre&s;ented memorials, explaining
in what manner foreign affairs would be influenced by an
alteration in the Briti&s;h mini&s;try. The Queen a&s;&s;ured
them, that, whatever changes might be made, the Duke of
Marlborough &s;hould be continued in his employments.
In the month of Augu&s;t the Earl of Godolphin was dive&s;ted
of his office, and the Trea&s;ury put in commi&s;&s;ion, &s;ubjected
to the direction of Harley, appointed chancellor of the
Exchequer and under-trea&s;urer. The Earl of Roche&s;ter
was declared pre&s;ident of the council, in the room of Lord
Somers: the &s;taff of lord-&s;teward being taken from the
Duke of Devon&s;hire, was given to the Duke of Bucking|ham;
and Mr. Boyle was removed from the &s;ecretary's
office, to make way for Mr. Henry St. John. The Lord-Chancellor
having re&s;igned the great &s;eal, it was fir&s;t put
in commi&s;&s;ion, and afterwards given to Sir Simon Har|court.
The Earl of Wharton &s;urrendered his commi&s;&s;ion
<PB N="178" REF="184">
of lord-lieutenant of Ireland, which the Queen conferred
on the Duke of Ormond. The Earl of Orford withdrew
him&s;elf from the board of Admiralty; and Mr. George
Granville was appointed &s;ecretary of war, in the room of
Mr. Robert Walpole. The command of the forces in
Portugal was be&s;towed upon the Earl of Portmore: the
Duke of Hamilton was appointed lord-lieutenant of the
county palatine of Lanca&s;ter. In a word, there was not
one Whig left in any office of &s;tate, except the Duke of
Marlborough, who would have renounced his command,
had not he been earne&s;tly di&s;&s;uaded by his particular friends
from taking &s;uch a &s;tep as might have been prejudicial to
the intere&s;t of the nation. That the triumph of the Tories
might be complete, the Queen di&s;&s;olved the Whig par|liament,
after &s;uch precautions were taken as could not
fail to influence the new election in favour of the other
party.</P>
<P>&sect; XIX. To this end nothing &s;o effectually contributed
as did the trial of Sacheverel, who was u&s;ed as an in&s;tru|ment
and tool to wind and turn the pa&s;&s;ions of the vulgar.
Having been pre&s;ented to a benefice in North-Wales, he
went in proce&s;&s;ion to that country, with all the pomp and
magnificence of a &s;overeign prince. He was &s;umptu|ou&s;ly
entertained by the univer&s;ity of Oxford, and different
noblemen, who, while they wor&s;hipped him as the idol of
their faction, could not help de&s;pi&s;ing the object of their
adoration. He was received in &s;everal towns by the ma|gi&s;trates
of the corporation in their formalities, and often
attended by a body of a thou&s;and hor&s;e. At Bridgenorth
he was met by Mr. Cre&s;well, at the head of four thou&s;and
hor&s;e, and the like number of per&s;ons on foot, wearing
white knots edged with gold, and three leaves of gilt
laurel in their hats. The hedges were for two miles
dre&s;&s;ed with garlands of flowers, and lined with people;
and the &s;teeples covered with &s;treamers, flags, and colours.
Nothing was heard but the cry of &startq;the church and Dr.
Sacheverel.&endq; The clergy were actuated by a &s;pirit of
enthu&s;ia&s;m, which &s;eemed to &s;pread like a contagion
<PB N="179" REF="185">
through all ranks and degrees of people, and had &s;uch
effect upon the elections for the new parliament, that very
few were returned as members but &s;uch as had di&s;tingui&s;hed
them&s;elves by their zeal again&s;t the Whig admini&s;tration.
Now the Queen had the plea&s;ure to &s;ee all the offices of
&s;tate, the lieutenancy of London, the management of
corporations, and the direction of both Hou&s;es of parlia|ment
in the hands of the Tories. When the&s;e met on
the twenty-fifth day of November, Mr. Bromley was
cho&s;en &s;peaker without oppo&s;ition. The Queen, in her
&s;peech, recommended the pro&s;ecution of the war with
vigour, e&s;pecially in Spain. She declared her&s;elf re&s;olved
to &s;upport the church of England; to pre&s;erve the Briti&s;h
con&s;titution according to the union; to maintain the in|dulgence
by law allowed to &s;crupulous con&s;ciences; and
to employ none but &s;uch as were heartily attached to the
prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the hou&s;e of Hanover. The Lords,
in their addre&s;s, promi&s;ed to concur in all rea&s;onable mea|&s;ures
towards procuring an honourable peace. The Com|mons
were more warm and hearty in their a&s;&s;urances,
exhorting her Maje&s;ty to di&s;countenance all &s;uch princi|ples
and mea&s;ures as had lately threatened her royal crown
and dignity; mea&s;ures, which, whenever they might pre|vail,
would prove fatal to the whole con&s;titution, both in
church and &s;tate. After this declaration they proceeded
to con&s;ider the e&s;timates, and chearfully granted the &s;up|plies
for the en&s;uing year, part of which was rai&s;ed by two
lotteries. In the Hou&s;e of Peers, the Earl of Scarborough
moved that the thanks of the Hou&s;e &s;hould be returned
to the Duke of Marlborough; but the Duke of Argyle
made &s;ome objections to the motion, and the general's
friends, dreading the con&s;equence of putting the que&s;tion,
po&s;tponed the con&s;ideration of this propo&s;al until the Duke
&s;hould return from the continent. The Earl of Peter|borough
was appointed amba&s;&s;ador extraordinary to the
Imperial court: the Earl of Rivers was &s;ent in the &s;ame
quality to Hanover; Mr. Richard Hill was nominated
envoy extraordinary to the United Provinces, as well as
<PB N="180" REF="186">
to the council of &s;tate appointed for the government of the
Spani&s;h Netherlands, in the room of Lieutenant-General
Cadogan. Meredith, Macartney, and Honeywood were
deprived of their regiments, becau&s;e in their cups they
had drunk confu&s;ion to the enemies of the Duke of Marl|borough.</P>
<P>&sect; XX. This nobleman arrived in England towards the
latter end of December. He conferred about half an hour
in private with the Queen, and next morning a&s;&s;i&s;ted at a
committee of the privy-council. Her Maje&s;ty gave him
to under&s;tand that he needed not to expect the thanks of
the parliament as formerly; and told him &s;he hoped he
would live well with her mini&s;ters. He expre&s;&s;ed no re|&s;entment
at the alterations which had been made; but re|&s;olved
to acquie&s;ce in the Queen's plea&s;ure, and retain the
command of the army on her own terms. On the &s;econd
day of January, the Queen &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to both Hou&s;es,
intimating that there had been an action in Spain to the
di&s;advantage of King Charles; that the damage having
fallen particularly on the Engli&s;h forces, &s;he had given di|rections
for &s;ending and procuring troops to repair the
lo&s;s, and hoped the parliament would approve her conduct.
Both Hou&s;es &s;ei&s;ed this opportunity of venting their &s;pleen
again&s;t the old mini&s;try. The hi&s;tory of England is di&s;|graced
by the violent conduct of two turbulent factions,
which, in their turn, engro&s;&s;ed the admini&s;tration and legi&s;|lative
power. The parliamentary &s;train was quite altered.
One can hardly conceive how re&s;olutions &s;o widely differ|ent
could be taken on the &s;ame &s;ubject, with any &s;hadow of
rea&s;on and decorum. Marlborough, who but a few
months before had been &s;o highly extolled and care&s;&s;ed by
the repre&s;entatives of the people, was now become the
object of parliamentary hatred and cen&s;ure, though no
&s;en&s;ible alteration had happened in his conduct or &s;ucce&s;s.
That hero, who had retrieved the glory of the Briti&s;h arms,
won &s;o many battles, &s;ubdued &s;uch a number of towns
and di&s;tricts, humbled the pride, and checked the am|bition
of France, &s;ecured the liberty of Europe; and, as
<PB N="181" REF="187">
it were, chained victory to his chariot wheels; was in a
few weeks dwindled into an object of contempt and deri&s;i|on.
He was ridiculed in publick libels, and reviled in
private conver&s;ation. In&s;tances were every where repeated
of his fraud, avarice, and extortion; his in&s;olence, cruelty,
ambition, and mi&s;conduct: even his courage was called in
que&s;tion; and this con&s;ummate general was repre&s;ented
as the lowe&s;t of mankind. So un&s;table is the popularity
of every character that fluctuates between two oppo&s;ite
tides of faction.</P>
<P>&sect; XXI. The Lords, in their an&s;wer to the Queen's me&s;|&s;age,
declared, that as the misfortune in Spain might have
been occa&s;ioned by &s;ome preceding mi&s;management, they
would u&s;e their utmo&s;t endeavours to di&s;cover it, &s;o as to
prevent the like for the future. They &s;et on foot an
enquiry concerning the affairs of Spain; and the Earl of
Peterborough being examined before the committee, im|puted
all the mi&s;carriages in the cour&s;e of that war to the
Earl of Galway and General Stanhope. Notwith&s;tanding
the defence of Galway, which was clear and convincing,
the Hou&s;e re&s;olved, That the Earl of Peterborough had
given a faithful and honourable account of the councils
of war in Valencia: That the Earl of Galway, Lord
Tyrawley, and General Stanhope, in advi&s;ing an offen|&s;ive
war, had been the unhappy occa&s;ion of the battle at
Almanza, the &s;ource of our misfortunes in Spain, and one
great cau&s;e of the di&s;appointment from the expedition to
Toulon, concerted with her Maje&s;ty. They voted, That
the pro&s;ecution of an offen&s;ive war in Spain was approved
and directed by the mini&s;ters, who were, therefore, ju&s;tly
blameable, as having contributed to all our misfortunes
in Spain, and to the di&s;appointment of the expedition
again&s;t Toulon: That the Earl of Peterborough, during
his command in Spain, had performed many great and
eminent &s;ervices; and, if his opinion had been followed,
it might have prevented the misfortunes that en&s;ued. Then
the Duke of Buckingham moved, That the thanks of the
Hou&s;e &s;hould be given to the Earl, for his remarkable and
<PB N="182" REF="188">
eminent &s;ervices; and the&s;e he actually received from the
mouth of the Lord-Keeper Harcourt, who took this oppor|tunity
to drop &s;ome oblique reflexions upon the merce|nary
di&s;po&s;ition of the Duke of Marlborough. The Hou&s;e
proceeding in the enquiry, pa&s;&s;ed another vote, importing,
That the late mini&s;try had been negligent in managing the
Spani&s;h war, to the great prejudice of the nation. Find|ing
that the Portugue&s;e troops were po&s;ted on the right of
the Engli&s;h at the battle of Almanza, they re&s;olved, that
the Earl of Galway, in yielding this point, had acted con|trary
to the honour of the imperial crown of Great-Britain.
The&s;e re&s;olutions they included in an addre&s;s to the Queen,
who had been pre&s;ent during the debates, which were ex|tremely
violent; and to every &s;eparate vote was attached a
&s;evere prote&s;t. The&s;e were not the proceedings of candour
and national ju&s;tice, but the ebullitions of party zeal and
rancorous animo&s;ity.</P>
<P>&sect; XXII. While the Lords were employed in this en|quiry,
the Commons examined certain abu&s;es which had
crept into the management of the navy; and &s;ome cen|&s;ures
were pa&s;&s;ed upon certain per&s;ons concerned in con|tracts
for victualling the &s;eamen. The inhabitants of St.
Olave's and other pari&s;hes pre&s;ented a petition, complain|ing
that a great number of Palatines inhabiting one hou&s;e
might produce among them a contagious di&s;temper; and
in time become a charge to the publick, as they were
de&s;titute of all vi&s;ible means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. This petition
had been procured by the Tories, that the Hou&s;e of Com|mons
might have another handle for attacking the late
mini&s;try. A committee was appointed to enquire upon
what invitation or encouragement tho&s;e Palatines had
come to England. The papers relating to this affair being
laid before them by the Queen's order, and peru&s;ed, the
Hou&s;e re&s;olved, That the inviting and bringing over the
poor Palatines of all religions, at the publick expen&s;e,
was an extravagant and unrea&s;onable charge to the king|dom,
and a &s;candalous mi&s;application of the publick
money, tending to the increa&s;e and oppre&s;&s;ion of the poor,
<PB N="183" REF="189">
and of dangerous con&s;equence to the con&s;titution in church
and &s;tate; and, That whoever advi&s;ed their being brought
over was an enemy to the Queen and kingdom. Ani|mated
by the heat of this enquiry, they pa&s;&s;ed the bill to
repeal the act for a general naturalization of all prote&s;tants:
but this was rejected in the Hou&s;e of Lords. Another
bill was enacted into a law, importing, That no per&s;on
&s;hould be deemed qualified for repre&s;enting a county in
parliament, unle&s;s he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an e&s;tate of &s;ix hundred
pounds a-year; and re&s;tricting the qualification of burge&s;s
to half that &s;um. The de&s;ign of this bill was to exclude
trading people from the Hou&s;e of Commons, and to lodge
the legi&s;lative power with the land-holders. A third act
pa&s;&s;ed, permitting the importation of French wine in neu|tral
bottoms; a bill again&s;t which the Whigs loudly ex|claimed,
as a national evil, and a &s;candalous compliment
to the enemy.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIII. A violent party in the Hou&s;e of Commons be|gan
to look upon Harley as a lukewarm Tory, becau&s;e he
would not enter precipitately into all their factious mea&s;ures:
they even began to &s;u&s;pect his principles, when his credit was
re-e&s;tabli&s;hed by a very &s;ingular accident. Gui&s;card, the
French parti&s;an, of whom mention hath already been made,
thought him&s;elf very ill rewarded for his &s;ervices, with a
precarious pen&s;ion of four hundred pounds, which he en|joyed
from the Queen's bounty. He had been renounced
by St. John the former companion of his plea&s;ures: he
had in vain endeavoured to obtain an audience of the
Queen, with a view to demand more con&s;iderable appoint|ments.
Harley was his enemy, and all acce&s;s to her Ma|je&s;ty
was denied. Enraged at the&s;e di&s;appointments, he
attempted to make his peace with the court of France,
and offered his &s;ervices, in a letter to one Moreau, a
banker, in Paris. This packet, which he endeavoured to
tran&s;mit by the way of Portugal, was intercepted, and a
warrant i&s;&s;ued out to apprehend him for high-trea&s;on.
When the me&s;&s;enger di&s;armed him in St. James's park,
he exhibited marks of guilty confu&s;ion and de&s;pair, and
<PB N="184" REF="190">
begged that he would kill him directly. Being conveyed
to the cockpit, in a &s;ort of frenzy, he perceived a pen|knife
lying upon a table, and took it up without being
perceived by the attendants. A committee of council
was immediately &s;ummoned, and Gui&s;card brought before
them to be examined. Finding that his corre&s;pondence with
Moreau was di&s;covered, he de&s;ired to &s;peak in private with
Secretary St. John, whom, in all probability, he had re|&s;olved
to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate. His reque&s;t being refu&s;ed, he &s;aid,
&startq;That's hard! not one word!&endq; St. John being out of
his reach, he &s;tepped up to Mr. Harley, and exclaiming,
&startq;Have at thee, then!&endq; &s;tabbed him in the brea&s;t with the
penknife which he had concealed. The in&s;trument broke
upon the bone, without penetrating into the cavity; never|thele&s;s,
he repeated the blow with &s;uch force, that the
Chancellor of the Exchequer fell to the ground. Secretary
St. John, &s;eeing him fall, cried out, &startq;The villain has
killed Mr. Harley!&endq; and drew his &s;word. Several other
members followed his example, and wounded Gui&s;card in
&s;everal places. Yet he made a de&s;perate defence, until he
was overpowered by the me&s;&s;engers and &s;ervants, and con|veyed
from the council-chamber, which he had filled with
terrour, tumult, and confu&s;ion. His wounds, though dan|gerous,
were not mortal; but he died of a gangrene oc|ca&s;ioned
by the brui&s;es he had &s;u&s;tained. This attempt
upon the life of Harley, by a per&s;on who wanted to e&s;ta|bli&s;h
a traiterous corre&s;pondence with France, extingui&s;hed
the &s;u&s;picions of tho&s;e who began to doubt that mini&s;ter's
integrity. The two Hou&s;es of parliament, in an addre&s;s
to the Queen, declard their belief, that Mr. Harley's
fidelity to her Maje&s;ty, and zeal for her &s;ervice, had
drawn upon him the hatred of all the abettors of popery
and faction.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet.</NOTE> They be&s;ought her Maje&s;ty to take all po&s;|&s;ible
care of her &s;acred per&s;on;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quincy.</NOTE> and,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feuquieres.</NOTE> for that purpo&s;e, to

<PB N="185" REF="191">
Commons after his recovery, he was congratulated upon
it by the Speaker, in a florid and ful&s;ome premediated
&s;peech. An act was pa&s;&s;ed, decreeing, That an attempt
upon the life of a privy-coun&s;ellor &s;hould be felony with|out
benefit of clergy.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conduct of the Duche&s;s of Marlbo|rough.</NOTE> The Earl of Roche&s;ter dying,
Harley became &s;ole mini&s;ter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tindal.</NOTE> was created baron of Wig|more,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the Admirals.</NOTE>
and rai&s;ed to the rank of earl, by the noble and an|tient
titles of Oxford and Mortimer:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Volataire.</NOTE> to crown his pro|&s;perity,
he was appointed lord-trea&s;urer, and ve&s;ted with
the &s;upreme admini&s;tration of affairs.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIV. The Commons empowered certain per&s;ons
to examine all the grants made by King William,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1711.</NOTE> and re|port
the value of them, as well as the con&s;iderations upon
which they were made. Upon their report a bill was
formed, pa&s;&s;ed that Hou&s;e; but the Lords rejected it
at the fir&s;t reading. Their next &s;tep was to examine the
publick accounts, with a view to fix an imputation on the
Earl of Godolphin. They voted, That above five-and-thirty
millions of the money granted by parliament remained
unaccounted for. This &s;um, however, included &s;ome ac|counts
in the reigns of King Charles and King William.
One half of the whole was charged to Mr. Bridges, the
payma&s;ter, who had actually accounted for all the money
he had received, except about three millions, though the&s;e
accounts had not pa&s;&s;ed through the auditor's office. The
Commons afterwards proceeded to enquire into the debts
of the navy, that exceeded five millions, which, with many
other debts, were thrown into one &s;tock, amounting to nine
millions four hundred and &s;eventy-one thou&s;and three
hundred and twenty-five pounds. A fund was formed for
paying an intere&s;t or annuity of &s;ix per cent. until the
principal &s;hould be di&s;charged; and with this was granted
a monopoly of a projected trade to the South-Sea, ve&s;ted
in the proprietors of navy-bills, debentures, and other
publick &s;ecurities, which were incorporated for this pur|po&s;e.
Such was the origin of the South-Sea company,
founded upon a chimerical &s;uppo&s;ition, that the Engli&s;h
would be permitted to trade upon the coa&s;t of Peru in the
<PB N="186" REF="192">
We&s;t-Indies.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK 1. 1711.</NOTE> Perhaps the new mini&s;try hoped to ob|tain
this permi&s;&s;ion, as an equivalent for their abandoning
the intere&s;t of King Charles, with re&s;pect to his preten|&s;ions
upon Spain. By this time the Emperor Jo&s;eph had
died of the &s;mall-pox without male i&s;&s;ue; &s;o that his bro|ther's
immediate aim was to &s;ucceed him on the Imperial
throne. This event was, on the twentieth day of April,
communicated by a me&s;&s;age from the Queen to both
Hou&s;es. She told them, that the States-General had con|curred
with her in a re&s;olution to &s;upport the Hou&s;e of
Au&s;tria; and that they had already taken &s;uch mea&s;ures
as would &s;ecure the election of Charles as head of the em|pire.</P>
<P>&sect; XXV. The Hou&s;e of Commons, in order to demon|&s;trate
their attachment to the church, in con&s;equence of
an addre&s;s from the lower hou&s;e of convocation, and a
quickening me&s;&s;age from the Queen, pa&s;&s;ed a bill for build|ing
fifty new churches in the &s;uburbs of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter,
and appropriated for this purpo&s;e the duty upon
coals, which had been granted for the building of St.
Paul's, now fini&s;hed. This impo&s;ition was continued
until it &s;hould rai&s;e the &s;um of three hundred and fifty
thou&s;and pounds. At the clo&s;e of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, the Com|mons
pre&s;ented a remon&s;trance or repre&s;entation to the
Queen, in which they told her, that they had not only
rai&s;ed the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies, but al&s;o di&s;charged the heavy
debts of which the nation had &s;o long and ju&s;tly com|plained.
They &s;aid, that, in tracing the cau&s;es of this
debt, they had di&s;covered fraud, embezzlement, and mi&s;|application
of the publick money: that they who of late
years had the management of the Trea&s;ury were guilty of
a notorious breach of tru&s;t and inju&s;tice to the nation, in
allowing above thirty millions to remain unaccounted for;
a purpo&s;ed omi&s;&s;ion that looked like a de&s;ign to conceal
embezzlements. They begged her Maje&s;ty would give
immediate directions for compelling the &s;everal impre&s;t ac|countants
&s;peedily to pa&s;s their accounts. They expre&s;&s;ed
their hope, that &s;uch of the accountants as had neglected
<PB N="187" REF="193">
their duty in pro&s;ecuting their accounts ought no longer
to be entru&s;ted with the publick money.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. X. 1711.</NOTE> They affirmed,
that from all the&s;e evil practices and wor&s;e de&s;igns of &s;ome
per&s;ons, who had, by fal&s;e profe&s;&s;ions of love to their coun|try,
in&s;inuated them&s;elves into her royal favour, irrepara|ble
mi&s;chief would have accrued to the publick, had not
her Maje&s;ty, in her great wi&s;dom, &s;ea&s;onably di&s;covered
the fatal tendency of &s;uch mea&s;ures, and removed from the
admini&s;tration tho&s;e who had &s;o ill an&s;wered her Maje&s;ty's
favourable opinion, and in &s;o many in&s;tances gro&s;ly abu&s;ed
the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them. They ob&s;erved, that her people
could with greater patience have &s;uffered the manifold
injuries done to them&s;elves, by the frauds and depredations
of &s;uch evil mini&s;ters, had not the &s;ame men proceeded to
treat her &s;acred per&s;on with undutifulne&s;s and di&s;regard.
This repre&s;entation being circulated through the kingdom,
produced the de&s;ired effect of inflaming the minds of the
people again&s;t the late mini&s;try. Such expedients were
become nece&s;&s;ary for the execution of Oxford's project,
which was to put a &s;peedy end to a war that had already
&s;ubjected the people to grievous oppre&s;&s;ion, and even
accumulated heavy burthens to be tran&s;mitted to their
po&s;terity. The nation was in&s;pired by extravagant ideas
of glory and conque&s;t, even to a rage of war-making; &s;o
that the new mini&s;ters, in order to di&s;pel tho&s;e dangerous
chimeras, were obliged to take mea&s;ures for exciting their
indignation and contempt again&s;t tho&s;e per&s;ons whom they
had formerly idoli&s;ed as their heroes and patriots. On the
twelfth day of June, the Queen having given the royal
a&s;&s;ent to &s;everal publick and private bills, made an a&s;&s;ec|tionate
&s;peech to both Hou&s;es. She thanked the Com|mons,
in the warme&s;t expre&s;&s;ions, for having complied
with all her de&s;ires; for having ba&s;&s;led the expectations of
her enemies in finding &s;upplies for the &s;ervice of the en|&s;uing
year; in having granted greater &s;ums than were ever
given to any prince in one &s;e&s;&s;ion; and in having &s;ettled
funds for the payment of the publick debts, &s;o that the
credit of the nation was re&s;tored. She expre&s;&s;ed her earne&s;t
<PB N="188" REF="194">
concern for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e of Hanover; and
her fixed re&s;olution to &s;upport and encourage the church of
England as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed. Then the parliament was
prorogued.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVI. Of the convocation which was a&s;&s;embled
with the new parliament, the lower hou&s;e cho&s;e Dr.
Atterbury their prolocutor. He was an enterpri&s;ing ec|cle&s;ia&s;tick,
of exten&s;ive learning, acute talents, violently
attached to Tory principles, and intimately connected
with the prime mini&s;ter, Oxford; &s;o that he directed all
the proceedings in the lower hou&s;e of convocation, in
concert with that mini&s;ter. The Queen, in a letter to the
archbi&s;hop, &s;ignified her hope, that the con&s;ultations of
the clergy might be of u&s;e to repre&s;s the attempts of loo&s;e
and profane per&s;ons. She &s;ent a licen&s;e under the broad
feal, empowering them to &s;it and do bu&s;ine&s;s in as ample
a manner as ever had been granted &s;ince the reformation.
They were ordered to lay before the Queen an account of
the exce&s;&s;ive growth of infidelity and here&s;y, as well as of
other abu&s;es, that nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures might be taken for
a reformation. The bi&s;hops were purpo&s;ely &s;lighted and
overlooked, becau&s;e they had lived in harmony with the
late mini&s;ters. A committee being appointed to draw up
a repre&s;entation of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the church and re|ligion,
Atterbury undertook the talk, and compo&s;ed a re|mon&s;trance
that contained the mo&s;t keen and &s;evere &s;tric|tures
upon the admini&s;tration, as it had been exerci&s;ed
&s;ince the time of the Revolution. Another was penned
by the bi&s;hops in more moderate terms; and &s;everal regu|lations
were made, but in none of the&s;e did the two
Hou&s;es agree. They concurred, however, in cen&s;uring
&s;ome tenets &s;avouring Ariani&s;m, broached and &s;upported
by Mr. Whi&s;ton, mathematical profe&s;&s;or in Cambridge.
He had been expelled the univer&s;ity, and wrote a vindi|cation
of him&s;elf, dedicated to the convocation. The
archbi&s;hop doubted whether this a&s;&s;embly could proceed
again&s;t a man for here&s;y: the judges were con&s;ulted, and
the majority of them gave in their opinion, that the con|vocation
<PB N="189" REF="195">
had a juri&s;diction. Four of them profe&s;&s;ed the
contrary &s;entiment, which they maintained from the
&s;tatutes made at the reformation. The Queen, in a letter
to the bi&s;hops, &s;aid, that as there was now no doubt of
their juri&s;diction, &s;he expected they would proceed in the
matter before them. Fre&s;h &s;cruples ari&s;ing, they deter|mined
to examine the book, without proceeding again&s;t the
author, and this was cen&s;ured accordingly. An extract
of the &s;entence was &s;ent to the Queen; but &s;he did not
&s;ignify her plea&s;ure on this &s;ubject, and the affair remained
in &s;u&s;pen&s;e. Whi&s;ton publi&s;hed a work in four volumes,
ju&s;tifying his doctrine, and maintaining that the apo&s;to|lical
con&s;titutions were not only canonical, but al&s;o
preferable in point of authority to the epi&s;tles and the
go&s;pel.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVII. The new mini&s;try had not yet determined to
&s;uper&s;ede the Duke of Marlborough in the command of
the army. This was a &s;tep which could not be taken
without giving umbrage to the Dutch and other allies.
He, therefore, &s;et out for Holland in the month of Febru|ary,
after the Queen had a&s;&s;ured him, that he might depend
upon the punctual payment of the forces. Having con|ferred
with the deputies of the States about the operations
of the campaign, he, about the middle of April, a&s;&s;embled
the army at Orchies, between Li&s;le and Douay; while
Mare&s;chal de Villars drew together the French troops in
the neighbourhood of Cambray and Arras. Louis had
by this time depopulated as well as impoveri&s;hed his king|dom;
yet his &s;ubjects &s;till flocked to his &s;tandard with
&s;urpri&s;ing &s;pirit and attachment. Under the pre&s;&s;ure of
extreme mi&s;ery they uttered not one complaint of
their &s;overeign; but imputed all their calamities to the
pride and ob&s;tinacy of the allies. Exclu&s;ive of all the other
impo&s;itions that were laid upon that people, they con|&s;ented
to pay the tenth penny of their whole &s;ub&s;tance:
but all their efforts of loyalty and affection to their prince
would have been ineffectual, had not the merchants of the
kingdom, by the permi&s;&s;ion of Philip, undertaken
<PB N="190" REF="196">
repeated voyages to the South-Sea, from whence they brought
home immen&s;e trea&s;ures; while the allies took no &s;teps for
intercepting the&s;e &s;upplies, though nothing could have
been more ea&s;y for the Engli&s;h than to deprive the enemy
of this great re&s;ource, and convert it to their own ad|vantage.
Had a &s;quadron of &s;hips been annually employed
for this purpo&s;e, the &s;ubjects of France and Spain mu&s;t
have been literally &s;tarved, and Louis obliged to &s;ubmit
to &s;uch terms as the confederates might have thought
proper to impo&s;e. Villars had &s;ound means to a&s;&s;emble a
very numerous army, with which he encamped behind the
river San&s;et, in &s;uch an advantageous po&s;t as could not be
attacked with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. Mean while the
Duke of Marlborough pa&s;&s;ed the Scarpe, and formed his
camp between Douay and Bouchain, where he was joined
by Prince Eugene on the twenty-third day of May. This
general, however, did not long remain in the Netherlands.
Under&s;tanding that detachments had been made from the
army of Villars to the Rhine, and that the Elector of
Bavaria intended to act in the empire, the Prince, by order
from the court of Vienna, marched towards the Upper
Rhine with the Imperial and Palatine troops, to &s;ecure
Germany. The Duke of Marlborough repa&s;&s;ing the
Scarpe, encamped in the plains of Lens, from whence he
advanced towards Aire, as if he had intended to attack
the French lines in that quarter. The&s;e lines, beginning
at Bouchain on the Schelde, were continued along the
San&s;et and the Scarpe to Arras, and thence along the Upper
Scarpe to Canch&eacute;. They were defended by redoubts and
other works, in &s;uch a manner, that Villars judged they
were impregnable, and called them the <HI>Ne plus ultra</HI> of
Marlborough.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVIII. This nobleman advancing within two
leagues of the French lines, ordered a great number of
fa&s;cines to be made, declaring he would attack them the
next morning; &s;o that Villars drew all his forces on that
&s;ide, in full expectation of an engagement. The Duke,
on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the pa&s;&s;age of the San&s;et by
<PB N="191" REF="197">
Arleux would be left unguarded, had ordered the Generals
Cadogan and Hompe&s;ch to a&s;&s;emble twenty battalions
and &s;eventeen &s;quadrons from Douay and the neighbour|ing
garri&s;ons, to march to Arleux, where they &s;hould en|deavour
to pa&s;s the San&s;et. Brigadier Sutton was de|tached
with the artillery and pontoons, to lay bridges over
the canal near Goulezen, and over the Scarpe at Vitry,
while the Duke, with the whole confederate army, began
his march for the &s;ame place about nine in the evening.
He proceeded with &s;uch expedition, that by five in the morn|ing
he pa&s;&s;ed the river at Vitry. There he received intelli|gence,
that Hompe&s;ch had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the pa&s;&s;es
on the San&s;et and Schelde without oppo&s;ition, the enemy
having withdrawn their detachments from that &s;ide, ju&s;t
as he had imagined. He him&s;elf, with his vanguard of
fifty &s;quadrons, ha&s;tened his march towards Arleux, and
before eight of the clock arrived at Bac&aacute;-Bachuel, where
in two hours he was joined by the heads of the columns
into which he had divided his infantry. Villars being
certified of his intention, about two in the morning, de|camped
with his whole army, and putting him&s;elf at the
head of the King's hou&s;ehold troops, marched all night with
&s;uch expedition, that about eleven in the &s;orenoon he was
in &s;ight of the Duke of Marlborough, who had by this
time joined Count Hompe&s;ch. The French general im|mediately
retreated to the main body of his army, which
had advanced to the high-road between Arras and Cam|bray,
while the allies encamped upon the Schelde, between
Oi&s;y and E&s;trun, after a march of ten leagues without
halting, &s;carce to be paralleled in hi&s;tory. By this plan,
&s;o happily executed, the Duke of Marlborough fairly out|witted
Villars, and, without the lo&s;s of one man, en|tered
the lines which he had pronounced impregnable.
This &s;troke of the Engli&s;h general was extolled as a
ma&s;ter-piece of military &s;kill, while Villars was expo&s;ed
to the ridicule even of his own officers. The field de|puties
of the States-General propo&s;ed that he &s;hould give
battle to the enemy, who pa&s;&s;ed the Schelde at Creve|coeur,
<PB N="192" REF="198">
in order to cover Bouchain: but the Duke would
not hazard an engagement, con&s;idering how much the
army was fatigued by the long march; and that any mi&s;|fortune,
while they continued within the French lines,
might be fatal. His intention was to be&s;iege Bouchain;
an enterpri&s;e that was deemed impracticable, ina&s;much as
the place was &s;ituated in a mora&s;s, &s;trongly fortified, and
defended by a numerous garri&s;on, in the neighbourhood
of an army &s;uperior in number to that of the allies.
Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e di&s;advantages, and the di&s;&s;ua&s;ions
of his own friends, he re&s;olved to undertake the &s;iege;
and, in the mean time, di&s;patched Brigadier Sutton to
England, with an account of his having pa&s;&s;ed the French
lines; which was not at all agreeable to his enemies. They
had progno&s;ticated that nothing would be done during
this campaign, and began to in&s;inuate that the Duke
could &s;trike no &s;troke of importance without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
of Prince Eugene. They now endeavoured to le&s;&s;en the
glory of his &s;ucce&s;s; and even taxed him with having
removed his camp from a convenient &s;ituation to a place
where the troops were in danger of &s;tarving. Nothing
could be more provoking than this &s;candalous malevo|lence
to a great man who had done &s;o much honour to
his country, and was then actually expo&s;ing his life in her
&s;ervice.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIX. On the tenth day of Augu&s;t, Bouchain was
inve&s;ted, and the Duke of Marlborough exerted him&s;elf
to the utmo&s;t extent of his vigilance and capacity, well
knowing the difficulties of the undertaking, and how much
his reputation would depend upon his &s;ucce&s;s. Villars
had taken every precaution that his &s;kill and experience
could &s;ugge&s;t, to baffle the endeavours of the Engli&s;h
general. He had re-enforced the garri&s;on to the number of
&s;ix thou&s;and cho&s;en men, commanded by officers of known
courage and ability. He made &s;ome efforts to rai&s;e the
&s;iege; but they were rendered ineffectual by the con&s;um|mate
prudence and activity of the Duke of Marlborough.
Then he laid a &s;cheme for &s;urpri&s;ing Douay, which
<PB N="193" REF="199">
likewi&s;e mi&s;carried. If we con&s;ider that the Engli&s;h gene|ral,
in the execution of his plan, was obliged to form lines,
erect regular forts, rai&s;e batteries, throw bridges over a
river, make a cau&s;eway through a deep mora&s;s, provide for
the &s;ecurity of convoys again&s;t a numerous army on one
&s;ide, and the garri&s;ons of Cond&eacute; and Valenciennes on the
other, we mu&s;t allow this was the bolde&s;t enterpri&s;e
of the whole war; that it required all the fortitude,
&s;kill, and re&s;olution of a great general, and all the va|lour
and intrepidity of the confederate troops, who had
&s;carce ever exhibited &s;uch amazing proofs of courage upon
any other occa&s;ion as they now di&s;played at the &s;iege
of Bouchain. In twenty days after the trenches were
opened, the garri&s;on were obliged to &s;urrender them&s;elves
pri&s;oners of war; and this conque&s;t was the la&s;t military
exploit performed by the Duke of Marlborough: the
breaches of Bouchain were no &s;ooner repaired than the
oppo&s;ite armies began to &s;eparate, and the allied forces
were quartered in the frontier towns, that they might be
at hand to take the field early in the &s;pring. They were
now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Mae&s;e, almo&s;t as far as the Sambre;
of the Schelde from Tournay; and of the Lys as far as it
is navigable. They had reduced Spani&s;h Guelderland,
Limburg, Brabant, Flanders, and the greate&s;t part of
Hainault: they were ma&s;ters of the Scarpe; and, by the
conque&s;t of Bouchain, they had opened to them&s;elves a
way into the very bowels of France. All the&s;e acqui&s;i|tions
were owing to the valour and conduct of the Duke
of Marlborough, who now returned to the Hague, and
arrived in England about the middle of November.</P>
<P>&sect; XXX. The Queen had conferred the command of her
forces in Spain upon the Duke of Argyle, who was re|called
from the &s;ervice in Flanders for that purpo&s;e. He
had long been at variance with the Duke of Marlborough;
a circum&s;tance which recommended him the more &s;trongly
to the mini&s;try. He landed at Barcelona on the twenty-ninth
of May, and found the Briti&s;h troops in the utmo&s;t
di&s;tre&s;s for want of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The Trea&s;urer had pro|mi&s;ed
<PB N="194" REF="200">
to &s;upply him liberally; the Commons had granted
one million five hundred thou&s;and pounds for that &s;ervice.
All their hopes of &s;ucce&s;s were fixed on the campaign in
that kingdom; and indeed the army commanded by the
Duke de Vendome was in &s;uch a wretched condition,
that if Staremberg had been properly &s;upported by the
allies, he might have obtained &s;ignal advantages. The
Duke of Argyle, having waited in vain for the promi&s;ed
remittances, was obliged to borrow money on his own
credit, before the Briti&s;h troops could take the field. At
length Staremberg advanced towards the enemy, who
attacked him at the pa&s;s of Prato del Rey, where they
were repul&s;ed with con&s;iderable damage. After this
action the Duke of Argyle was &s;ei&s;ed with a violent fever,
and conveyed back to Barcelona. Vendome inve&s;ted the
ca&s;tle of Cardona, which was vigorou&s;ly defended till the
end of December, when a detachment being &s;ent to the
relief of the place, defeated the be&s;iegers, killed two thou|&s;and
on the &s;pot, and took all their artillery, ammu|nition,
and baggage. Staremberg was unable to follow
the blow; the Duke of Argyle wrote pre&s;&s;ing letters to
the mini&s;try, and loudly complained that he was altogether
un&s;upported; but all his remon&s;trances were ineffectual;
no remittances arrived; and he returned to England
without having been able to attempt any thing of impor|tance.
In September, King Charles, leaving his queen
at Barcelona, &s;et &s;ail for Italy, and at Milan had an in|terview
with the Duke of Savoy, where all di&s;putes were
compromi&s;ed. That prince had forced his way into
Savoy, and penetrated as far as the Rhine; but he &s;ud|denly
halted in the middle of his career, and after a &s;hort
campaign repa&s;&s;ed the mountains. Prince Eugene, at the
head of the German forces, protected the Electors at
Franckfort from the de&s;igns of the enemy, and Charles was
unanimou&s;ly cho&s;en Emperor; the Electors of Cologn and
Bavaria having been excluded from voting, becau&s;e they
lay under the ban of the empire. The war between the
Ottoman Porte and the Mu&s;covites was of &s;hort duration.
<PB N="195" REF="201">
The Czar advanced &s;o far into Moldavia,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. X. 1711.</NOTE> that he was cut
off from all &s;upplies, and altogether in the power of his
enemy. In this emergency, he found means to corrupt
the Grand-Vi&s;ir in private, while in public he propo&s;ed
articles of peace that were accepted. The King of Sweden,
who was in the Turki&s;h army, charged the Vi&s;ir with
treachery, and that mini&s;ter was actually di&s;graced. The
Grand Signor threatened to renew the war; but he was
appea&s;ed by the Czar's &s;urrendering A&s;oph.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXI. The Engli&s;h mini&s;try had conceived great
expectations from an expedition again&s;t Quebeck and
Placentia, in North America, planned by Colonel Ni|chol&s;on
who had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Nova-Scotia, and
garri&s;oned Port-Royal, to which he gave the name of An|napolis.
He had brought four Indian chiefs to England,
and repre&s;ented the advantages that would redound to the
nation, in point of commerce, &s;hould the French be ex|pelled
from North-America. The mini&s;ters reli&s;hed the
propo&s;al. A body of five thou&s;and men was embarked in
tran&s;ports, under the command of Brigadier Hill, brother
to Mrs. Ma&s;ham; and they &s;ailed from Plymouth in the
beginning of May, with a &s;trong &s;quadron of &s;hips com|manded
by Sir Hovenden Walker. At Bo&s;ton in New-England,
they were joined by two regiments of Provin|cials;
and about four thou&s;and men, con&s;i&s;ting of Ameri|can
planters, Palatines, and Indians, rendezvou&s;ed at
Albany, in order to march by land into Canada, while
the fleet &s;ailed up the river of that name. On the twenty-fir&s;t
day of Augu&s;t, they were expo&s;ed to a violent &s;torm,
and driven among rocks, where eight tran&s;ports peri&s;hed,
with about eight hundred men. The admiral immediate|ly
&s;ailed back to Spani&s;h-River bay, where it was deter|mined,
in a council of war, that as the fleet and forces
were victualled for ten weeks only, and they could not
depend upon a &s;upply of provi&s;ions from New-England,
they &s;hould return home, without making any further at|tempt.
Such was the i&s;&s;ue of this paltry expedition,
<PB N="196" REF="202">
entru&s;ted to the direction of an officer without talents and
experience.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK I. 1711.</NOTE></P>
<P>&sect; XXXII. In the Iri&s;h parliament held during the
&s;ummer, the Duke of Ormond and the majority of the
Peers &s;upported the Tory-intere&s;t, while the Commons
expre&s;&s;ed the warme&s;t attachment to Revolution principles.
The two Hou&s;es made &s;trenuous repre&s;entations, and
pa&s;&s;ed &s;evere re&s;olutions again&s;t each other. After the
&s;e&s;&s;ion, Sir Con&s;tantine Phipps, the chancellor, and General
Ingold&s;by, were appointed ju&s;tices in the ab&s;ence of the
Duke of Ormond, who returned to England in the month
of November. In Scotland the Jacobites made no &s;cruple
of profe&s;&s;ing their principles and attachments to the Pre|tender.
The Duche&s;s of Gordon pre&s;ented the faculty
of Advocates with a &s;ilver medal, repre&s;enting the Chevalier
de St. George; and on the rever&s;e the Briti&s;h i&s;lands,
with the motto &startq;<HI>Redditte.</HI>&endq; After &s;ome debate, it was
voted, by a majority of &s;ixty-three voices again&s;t twelve,
that the Duche&s;s &s;hould be thanked for this token of her
regard. This ta&s;k was performed by Dunda&s;s of Arni|&s;toun,
who thanked her grace for having pre&s;ented them
with a medal of their &s;overeign lord the King; hoping,
and being confident, that her grace would very &s;oon have
an opportunity to compliment the Faculty with a &s;econd
medal, &s;truck upon the re&s;toration of the King and royal
family, upon the fini&s;hing rebellion, u&s;urping tyranny,
and whiggery. An account of this tran&s;action being laid
before the Queen, the Lord-Advocate was ordered to enquire
into the particulars. Then the Faculty were &s;o intimi|dated
that they di&s;owned Dunda&s;s, and Horne his accom|plice.
They pretended that the affair of the medal had
been tran&s;acted by a party at an occa&s;ional meeting, and
not by general con&s;ent; and by a &s;olemn act they declared
their attachment to the Queen and the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.
The court was &s;atisfied with this atonement; but the re|&s;ident
from Hanover having pre&s;ented a memorial to the
Queen, de&s;iring that Dunda&s;s and his a&s;&s;ociates might be
pro&s;ecuted, the government removed Sir David Dalrymp$$
<PB N="197" REF="203">
from his office of lord advocate, on pretence of his having
been too remi&s;s in pro&s;ecuting tho&s;e delinquents; and no
further enquiry was made into the affair.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIII. For &s;ome time a negociation for peace had
been carried on between the court of France and the new
mini&s;ters, who had a double aim in this mea&s;ure; namely,
to mortify the Whigs and the Dutch, whom they de|te&s;ted,
and to free their country from a ruinous war, which
had all the appearance of becoming habitual to the con|&s;titution.
They fore&s;aw the ri&s;que they would run by
entering into &s;uch mea&s;ures, &s;hould ever the oppo&s;ite
faction regain the a&s;cendancy; they knew the Whigs
would employ all their art and influence, which was very
powerful, in ob&s;tructing the peace, and in rai&s;ing a popu|lar
clamour again&s;t the treaty. But their motives for
treating were &s;uch as prompted them to undervalue all
tho&s;e difficulties and dangers. They hoped to obtain &s;uch
advantages in point of commerce for the &s;ubjects of
Great-Britain, as would &s;ilence all detraction. They
did not doubt of being able to maintain the &s;uperiority
which they had acquired in parliament; and perhaps &s;ome
of them cheri&s;hed views in favour of the Pretender, who&s;e
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown would have effectually e&s;tabli&s;hed
their dominion over the oppo&s;ite party. The Earl of
Jer&s;ey, who acted in concert with Oxford, &s;ent a private
me&s;&s;age to the court of France, importing the Queen's
earne&s;t de&s;ire of peace, repre&s;enting the impo&s;&s;ibility of a
private negociation, as the mini&s;try was obliged to act with
the utmo&s;t circum&s;pection, and de&s;iring that Louis would
propo&s;e to the Dutch a renewal of the conferences, in
which ca&s;e the Engli&s;h plenipotentiaries &s;hould have &s;uch
in&s;tructions, that it would be impo&s;&s;ible for the States-General
to prevent the conclu&s;ion of the treaty. This
intimation was delivered by one Gualtier, an ob&s;cure prie&s;t,
who acted as chaplain to Count Gallas, the Imperial am|ba&s;&s;ador,
and had been employed as a &s;py by the French
mini&s;try, &s;ince the commencement of ho&s;tilities. His
connexion with Lord Jer&s;ey was by means of that noble|man's
<PB N="198" REF="204">
lady, who profe&s;&s;ed the Roman Catholick religion.
His me&s;&s;age was extremely agreeable to the court of Ver|&s;ailles.
He returned to London, with a letter of compli|ment
from the Marquis de Torcy to the Earl of Jer&s;ey,
in which that mini&s;ter a&s;&s;ured him of his ma&s;ter's &s;incere
inclination for peace, though he was aver&s;e to a renewal
of the conferences with the States-General. Gualtier
wrote a letter to Ver&s;ailles, de&s;iring, in the name of the
Engli&s;h mini&s;try, that his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty would
communicate to them his propo&s;als for a general peace,
which they would communicate to the States-General,
that they might negociate in concert with their allies.
A general an&s;wer being made to this intimation, Gualtier
made a &s;econd journey to Ver&s;ailles, and brought over a
memorial, which was immediately tran&s;mitted to Holland.
In the mean time, the Pen&s;ionary endeavoured to renew
the conferences in Holland. Petkum wrote to the French
mini&s;try, that if his Maje&s;ty would re&s;ume the negociation,
in concert with the Queen of Great-Britain, he &s;hould
certainly have rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied with the conduct of the
Dutch deputies. This propo&s;al Louis declined, at the
de&s;ire of the Engli&s;h mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIV. The States-General having peru&s;ed the
memorial, a&s;&s;ured Queen Anne that they were ready to
join with her in contributing to the conclu&s;ion of a dura|ble
peace: but they expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire that the French
King would communicate a more particular plan for &s;e|curing
the intere&s;t of the allied powers, and for &s;ettling
the repo&s;e of Europe. Gualtier was once more &s;ent to
Ver&s;ailles, accompanied by Mr. Prior, who had re&s;ided
in France, as &s;ecretary to the emba&s;&s;ies of the Earls of
Portland and Jer&s;ey. This gentleman had acquired &s;ome
reputation by his poetial talents; was a man of uncom|mon
ability, in&s;inuating addre&s;s, and perfectly devoted to
the Tory intere&s;t. He was empowered to communicate
the preliminary demands of the Engli&s;h; to receive the
an&s;wer of the French King; and demand whether or not
King Philip had tran&s;mitted a power of treating to his
<PB N="199" REF="205">
grandfather. He arrived incognito at Fontainebleau, and
pre&s;ented the Queen's memorial, in which &s;he demanded
a barrier for the Dutch in the Netherlands, and another
on the Rhine for the empire; a &s;ecurity for the Dutch
commerce, and a general &s;atisfaction to all her allies.
She required that the &s;trong places taken from the Duke
of Savoy &s;hould be re&s;tored; and that he &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s
&s;uch towns and di&s;tricts in Italy as had been ceded to him
in treaties between him and his allies: that Louis &s;hould
acknowledge Queen Anne and the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion;
demoli&s;h the fortifications of Dunkirk; and agree to a
new treaty of commerce: that Gibralter and Port-Mahon
&s;hould be yielded to the crown of England: that the negro
trade in America, at that time carried on by the French,
&s;hould be ceded to the Engli&s;h, together with &s;ome towns
on that continent, where the &s;laves might be refre&s;hed.
She expected &s;ecurity that her &s;ubjects trading to Spain
&s;hould enjoy all advantages granted by that crown to the
mo&s;t favoured nation: that &s;he &s;hould be put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of Newfoundland and Hud&s;on's-Bay, either by way of
re&s;titution or ce&s;&s;ion; and that both nations &s;hould con|tinue
to enjoy whatever territories they might be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of in North-America at the ratification of the treaties.
She likewi&s;e in&s;i&s;ted upon a &s;ecurity that the crowns
of France and Spain &s;hould never be united on the
&s;ame head. Her Maje&s;ty no longer in&s;i&s;ted upon
Philip's being expelled from the throne of Spain by the
arms of his own grandfather. She now perceived that
the exorbitant power of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria would be as
dangerous to the liberty of Europe, as ever that of the
family of Bourbon had been, in the zenith of its glory.
She might have remembered the exce&s;&s;ive power, the in|&s;olence,
the ambition of Charles V. and Philip II. who
had en&s;laved &s;o many countries, and embroiled all Europe.
She was &s;increly de&s;irous of peace, from motives of hu|manity
and compa&s;&s;ion to her &s;ubjects and fellow-creatures:
&s;he was eagerly bent upon procuring &s;uch advantages to
<PB N="200" REF="206">
her people, as would enable them to di&s;charge the heavy
load of debt under which they laboured, and recompen&s;e
them in &s;ome mea&s;ure for the blood and trea&s;ure they had
&s;o lavi&s;hly expended in the pro&s;ecution of the war. The&s;e
were the &s;entiments of a Chri&s;tian prince&s;s; of an ami|able
and pious &s;overeign, who bore a &s;hare in the griev|ances
of her &s;ubjects, and looked upon them with the
eyes of maternal affection. She thought &s;he had the better
title to in&s;i&s;t upon tho&s;e advantages, as they had been
already granted to her &s;ubjects in a private treaty with
King Charles.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXV. As Prior's powers were limited in &s;uch
a manner that he could not negociate, Mr. Menager,
deputy from the city of Rouen to the Board of Trade, ac|companied
the Engli&s;h mini&s;ter to London, with full
powers to &s;ettle the preliminaries of the treaty. On his
arrival in London, the Queen immediately commi&s;&s;ioned
the Duke of Shrew&s;bury, the Earls of Jer&s;ey, Dartmouth,
Oxford, and Mr. St. John, to treat with him; and the
conferences were immediately begun. After long and
various di&s;putes, they agreed upon certain prelimary
articles, which, on the eighth day of October, were &s;igned
by the French mini&s;ter, and by the two &s;ecretaries of &s;tate,
in con&s;equence of a written order from her Maje&s;ty. Then
Menager was privately introduced to the Queen at Wind|&s;or.
She told him &s;he was aver&s;e to war: that &s;he would
exert all her power to conclude a &s;peedy peace: that &s;he
&s;hould be glad to live upon good terms with the King of
France, to whom &s;he was &s;o nearly allied in blood: &s;he
expre&s;&s;ed her hope that there would be a clo&s;er union after
the peace between them, and between their &s;ubjects, ce|mented
by a perfect corre&s;pondence and friend&s;hip. The
Earl of Strafford, who had been lately recalled from the
Hague, where he re&s;ided as amba&s;&s;ador, was now &s;ent back
to Holland, with orders to communicate to the Pen&s;ionary
the propo&s;als of peace which France had made; to &s;ignify
the Queen's approbation of them, and propo&s;e a place
where the plenipotentiaries &s;hould a&s;&s;emble. The Engli&s;h
<PB N="201" REF="207">
mini&s;ters now engaged in an intimate corre&s;pondence with
the court of Ver&s;ailles; and Mare&s;chal Tallard being re|lea&s;ed
from his confinement at Nottingham, was allowed
to return to his own country on his parole. After the de|parture
of Menager, the preliminaries were communi|cated
to Count Gallas, the Emperor's mini&s;ter, who, in
order to inflame the minds of the people, cau&s;ed them to
be tran&s;lated, and in&s;erted in one of the daily papers. This
&s;tep was &s;o much re&s;ented by the Queen, that &s;he &s;ent a
me&s;&s;age, de&s;iring he would come no more to court; but
that he might leave the kingdom as &s;oon as he &s;hould think
proper. He took the hint, and retired accordingly; but
the Queen gave the Emperor to under&s;tand, that any
other mini&s;ter he &s;hould appoint would be admitted by her
without he&s;itation.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVI. The States of Holland, alarmed at the
preliminaries, &s;ent over Buys, as envoy extraordinary, to
intercede with the Queen, that &s;he would alter her re&s;o|lutions;
but &s;he continued &s;teady to her purpo&s;e; and the
Earl of Strafford demanded the immediate concurrence of
the States, declaring, in the Queen's name, that &s;he
would look upon any delay, on their part, as a refu&s;al to
comply with her propo&s;itions. Intimidated by this decla|ration,
they agreed to open the general conferences at
Utrecht on the fir&s;t day of January. They granted pa&s;&s;|ports
to the French mini&s;ters; while the Queen appointed
Robin&s;on Bi&s;hop of Bri&s;tol, and the Earl of Strafford,
her plenipotentiaries at the congre&s;s. Charles, the new
Emperor, being at Milan when he received a copy of the
preliminaries, wrote circular letters to the Electors and
the princes of the empire, exhorting them to per&s;i&s;t in their
engagements to the grand alliance. He likewi&s;e de&s;ired
the States-General to join councils with him in per|&s;uading
the Queen of England to reject the propo&s;als of
France, and pro&s;ecute the war; or at lea&s;t to negociate
on the foundation of the fir&s;t preliminaries, which had
been &s;igned by the Marquis de Torey. He wrote a letter
to the &s;ame purpo&s;e to the Queen of Great-Britain, who
<PB N="202" REF="208">
received it with the mo&s;t mortifying indifference. No
wonder that he &s;hould zealou&s;ly contend for the con|tinuance
of a war, the expen&s;e of which &s;he and the Dutch
had hitherto almo&s;t wholly defrayed. The new prelimi|naries
were &s;everely attacked by the Whigs, who ridi|culed
and reviled the mini&s;try in word and writing. Pam|phlets,
libels, and lampoons were to-day publi&s;hed by one
faction, and to-morrow an&s;wered by the other. They
contained all the in&s;inuations of malice and contempt, all
the bitterne&s;s of reproach, and all the rancour of recrimi|nation.
In the mid&s;t of this contention, the Queen di&s;|patched
the Earl of Rivers to Hanover, with an a&s;&s;urance
to the Elector, that his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown &s;hould be
effectually a&s;certained in the treaty. The Earl brought
back an an&s;wer in writing: but, at the &s;ame time, his
electoral highne&s;s ordered the Baron de Bothmar, his en|voy
in England, to pre&s;ent a memorial to the Queen,
repre&s;enting the pernicious con&s;equences of Philip's re|maining
in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Spain and the We&s;t-Indies.
This remon&s;trance the Baron publi&s;hed, by way of appeal
to the people, and the Whigs extolled it with the highe&s;t
encomiums; but the Queen and her mini&s;ters re&s;ented this
&s;tep, as an officious and inflammatory interpo&s;ition.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVII. The propo&s;als of peace made by the French
King were di&s;agreeable even to &s;ome individuals of the
Tory party, and certain peers, who had hitherto adhered
to that intere&s;t, agreed with the Whigs, to make a re|mon&s;trance
again&s;t the preliminary articles. The court
being appri&s;ed of their intention, prorogued the parliament
till the &s;eventh day of December, in expectation of the
Scotti&s;h peers, who would ca&s;t the balance in favour of
the mini&s;try. In her &s;peech, at the opening of the &s;e&s;&s;ion,
&s;he told them that, notwith&s;tanding the arts of tho&s;e who
delighted in war, the place and time were appointed for a
congre&s;s; and that the States-General had expre&s;&s;ed their
entire confidence in her conduct. She declared her chief
concern &s;hould be to &s;ecure the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown in
the Hou&s;e of Hanover; to procure all the advantages to
<PB N="203" REF="209">
the nation which a tender and affectionate &s;overeign could
procure for a dutiful and loyal people; and to obtain &s;atis|faction
for all her allies. She ob&s;erved, that the mo&s;t
effectual way to procure an advantageous peace would
be to make preparations for carrying on the war with
vigour. She recommended unanimity, and prayed God
would direct their con&s;ultations. In the Hou&s;e of Lords,
the Earl of Nottingham, who had now a&s;&s;ociated him&s;elf
with the Whigs, inveighed again&s;t the preliminaries as
captious and in&s;ufficient, and offered a clau&s;e to be in|&s;erted
in the addre&s;s of thanks, repre&s;enting to her Ma|je&s;ty,
that, in the opinion of the Hou&s;e, no peace could
be &s;afe or honourable to Great-Britain or Europe, if Spain
and the We&s;t-Indies &s;hould be allotted to any branch of
the Hou&s;e of Bourbon. A violent debate en&s;ued, in the
cour&s;e of which the Earl of Angle&s;ey repre&s;ented the ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of ea&s;ing the nation of the burthens incurred by an
expen&s;ive war. He affirmed that a good peace might
have been procured immediately after the battle of Ramil|lies,
if it had not been prevented by &s;ome per&s;ons who
prolonged the war for their own private intere&s;t. This
in&s;inuation was levelled at the Duke of Marlborough, who
made a long &s;peech in his own vindication. He bowed to
the place where the Queen &s;at incognito; and appealed
to her, whether, while he had the honour to &s;erve her
Maje&s;ty as general and plenipotentiary, he had not con&s;tant|ly
informed her and her council of all the propo&s;als of
peace which had been made; and had not de&s;ired in&s;truc|tions
for his conduct on that &s;ubject? He declared, upon
his con&s;cience, and in pre&s;ence of the Supreme Being,
before whom he expected &s;oon to appear, that he was
ever de&s;irous of a &s;afe, honourable, and la&s;ting peace; and
that he was always very far from entertaining any de&s;ign
of prolonging the war for his own private advantage, as
his enemies had mo&s;t fal&s;ely in&s;inuated. At la&s;t the
que&s;tion being put, Whether the Earl of Nottingham's
advice &s;hould be part of the addre&s;s? it was carried in
the affirmative by a &s;mall majority. The addre&s;s was
<PB N="204" REF="210">
accordingly pre&s;ented; and the Queen, in her an&s;wer, &s;aid
&s;he &s;hould be very &s;orry any one could think &s;he would
not do her utmo&s;t to recover Spain and the We&s;t-Indies
from the Hou&s;e of Bourbon. Again&s;t this advice, how|ever,
&s;everal peers prote&s;ted, becau&s;e there was no prece|dent
for in&s;erting a clau&s;e of advice in an addre&s;s of thanks;
and becau&s;e they looked upon it as an inva&s;ion of the
royal prerogative. In the addre&s;s of the Commons there
was no &s;uch article; and, therefore, the an&s;wer they re|ceived
was warm and cordial.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVIII. The Duke of Hamilton claiming a &s;eat in
the Hou&s;e of Peers, as Duke of Brandon, a title he had
lately received, was oppo&s;ed by the anti-courtiers, who
pretended to fore&s;ee great danger to the con&s;titution from
admitting into the Hou&s;e a greater number of Scotti&s;h
peers than the act of Union allowed. Coun&s;el was heard
upon the validity of his patent. They ob&s;erved that no
objection could be made to the Queen's prerogative in con|ferring
honours; and that all the &s;ubjects of the united
kingdom were equally capable of receiving honour. The
Hou&s;e of Lords had already decided the matter, in ad|mitting
the Duke of Queen&s;berry upon his being created
Duke of Dover. The debate was managed with great
ability on both &s;ides: the Scotti&s;h peers united in defence
of the Duke's claim; and the court exerted its whole
&s;trength to &s;upport the patent. Neverthele&s;s, the que&s;tion
being put, Whether Scotti&s;h peers, created peers of Great-Britain
&s;ince the Union, had a right to &s;it in that Hou&s;e?
it was carried in the negative by a majority of $ive voices;
though not without a prote&s;t &s;igned by the lords in the
oppo&s;ition. The Scotti&s;h peers were &s;o incen&s;ed at this
deci&s;ion, that they drew up a repre&s;entation to the Queen,
complaining of it as an infringement of the Union, and a
mark of di&s;grace put upon the whole peerage of Scotland.
The bill again&s;t occa&s;ional conformity was revived by
the Earl of Nottingham, in more moderate terms than
tho&s;e that had been formerly rejected; and it pa&s;&s;ed both
<PB N="205" REF="211">
Hou&s;es by the connivance of the Whigs, upon the Earl's
promi&s;e, that if they would con&s;ent to this mea&s;ure, he
would bring over many friends to join them in matters of
greater con&s;equence. On the twenty-&s;econd day of De|cember,
the Queen being indi&s;po&s;ed, granted a commi&s;&s;ion
to the Lord-Keeper, and &s;ome other peers, to give the
royal a&s;&s;ent to this bill, and another for the land-tax.
The Duke of Devon&s;hire obtained leave to bring in a bill
for giving precedence of all peers to the Electoral Prince
of Hanover, as Duke of Cambridge. An addre&s;s was pre|&s;ented
to the Queen, de&s;iring &s;he would give in&s;tructions
to her plenipotentiaries, to con&s;ult with the mini&s;ters of
the allies in Holland before the opening of the congre&s;s;
that they might concert the nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures for pro|ceeding
with unanimity, the better to obtain the great ends
propo&s;ed by her Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIX. The commi&s;&s;ioners for examining the pub|lick
accounts having di&s;covered that the Duke of Marl|borough
had received an annual pre&s;ent of five or &s;ix
thou&s;and pounds from the contractors for bread to the
army, the Queen declared in council, that &s;he thought fit
to di&s;mi&s;s him from all his employments, that the matter
might be impartially examined. This declaration was im|parted
to him in a letter under her own hand, in which
&s;he took occa&s;ion to complain of the treatment &s;he had
received. She probably alluded to the in&s;olence of his
duche&s;s; the &s;ubjection in which &s;he had been kept by
the late mini&s;try; and the pains lately taken by the Whigs
to depreciate her conduct, and thwart her mea&s;ures with
re&s;pect to the peace. The Duke wrote an an&s;wer to her
Maje&s;ty, vindicating him&s;elf from the charge which had
been brought again&s;t his character; and his two daugh|ters,
the Counte&s;s of Sunderland and the Lady Rialton,
re&s;igned their places of ladies of the bed-chamber. The
mini&s;try, in order to a&s;certain a majority in the Hou&s;e of
Lords, per&s;uaded the Queen to take a mea&s;ure which no|thing
but nece&s;&s;ary could ju&s;tify. She created twelve
<PB N="206" REF="212">
peers at once<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Lord Compton and Lord Bruce, &s;ons of the Earls of Northampton and Ayle&s;bury, were called up by writ to the Hou&s;e of Peers. The other ten were the&s;e: Lord Duplin, of the kingdom of Scotland, created Baron Hay of Bedwardin, in the county of Hereford; Lord Vi&s;count Wind&s;or, of Ireland, made Baron Mountjoy, in the I&s;le of Wight; Henry Paget, &s;on of Lord Paget, created Baron Burton in the county of Stafford; Sir Thomas Man&s;el, Baron Man&s;el, of Margam, in the county of Glamorgan; Sir Thomas Wil|loughby, Baron Middleton, of Middleton, in the county of Warwick; Sir Thomas Trevor, Baron Trevor, of Bromham, in the county of Bedford; George Granville, Baron Land&s;down, of Biddeford, in the county of Devon; Samuel Ma&s;ham, Baron Ma&s;ham, of Oats, in the county of E&s;&s;ex; Thomas Foley, Baron Foley, of Kiddermin&s;ter, in the county of Worce&s;ter; and Allen Bathur&s;t, Baron Bathur&s;t, of Bathel&s;den, in the county of Bedford.&mdash;On the fir&s;t day of their being introduced, when the que&s;tion was put about ad|journing, the Earl of Wharton a&s;ked one of them, &startq;Whether they voted by their foreman?&endq;</NOTE> and on the &s;econd of January they were
introduced into the Upper-Hou&s;e without oppo&s;ition.
The Lord-Keeper delivered to the Hou&s;e a me&s;&s;age from
the Queen, de&s;iring they would adjourn to the fourteenth
day of the month. The anti-courtiers alledged that the
Queen could not &s;end a me&s;&s;age to any one Hou&s;e to ad|journ,
but ought to have directed it to both Hou&s;es. This
objection produced a debate, which was terminated in fa|vour
of the court by the weight of the twelve new peers.</P>
<P>&sect; XL. At this period Prince Eugene arrived in England,
with a letter to the Queen from the Emperor, and in|&s;tructions
to propo&s;e a new &s;cheme for pro&s;ecuting the
war. His errand was far from being agreeable to the mi|ni&s;try;
and they &s;u&s;pected that his real aim was to manage
intrigues among the di&s;contented party, who oppo&s;ed the
peace. Neverthele&s;s, he was treated with that re&s;pect
which was due to his quality and eminent talents. The
mini&s;ters, the nobility, and officers of di&s;tinction vi&s;ited
him at his arrival. He was admitted to an audience of
the Queen, who received him with great complacency.
Having peru&s;ed the letter which he delivered, &s;he ex|pre&s;&s;ed
her concern that her health did not permit her to
&s;peak with his Highne&s;s as often as &s;he could wi&s;h; but
that &s;he had ordered the Trea&s;urer and Secretary St. John
to receive his propo&s;als, and confer with him as fre|quently
<PB N="207" REF="213">
as he &s;hould think proper. He expre&s;&s;ed extra|ordinary
re&s;pect for the Duke of Marlborough, notwith|&s;tanding
his di&s;grace. The Lord-Trea&s;urer, while he
entertained him at dinner, declared that he looked upon
that day as the happie&s;t in the whole cour&s;e of his life,
&s;ince he had the honour to &s;ee in his hou&s;e the greate&s;t
captain of the age. The Prince is &s;aid to have replied,
&startq;If I am, it is owing to your lord&s;hip.&endq; Alluding to the
di&s;grace of Marlborough, whom the Earl's intrigues had
deprived of all military command. When Bi&s;hop Bur|net
conver&s;ed with him about the &s;candalous libels that
were every day publi&s;hed again&s;t the Duke, and in par|ticular
mentioned one paragraph, in which the author
allowed he had been once fortunate, the Prince ob&s;erved
it was greate&s;t commendation that could be be&s;towed
upon him, as it implied that all his other &s;ucce&s;&s;es were
owing to his courage and conduct. While the nobility of
both parties vied with each other in demon&s;trations of re|&s;pect
for this noble &s;tranger; while he was adored by the
Whigs, and admired by the people, who gazed at him in
crouds when he appeared in publick; even in the mid&s;t of
all the&s;e care&s;&s;es, party riots were excited to in&s;ult his per|&s;on,
and &s;ome &s;candalous reflexions upon his mother were
in&s;erted in one of the publick papers. The Queen treated
him with di&s;tingui&s;hed marks of regard; and, on her
birth-day, pre&s;ented him with a &s;word worth five thou&s;and
pounds. Neverthele&s;s, &s;he looked upon him as a patron
and friend of that turbulent faction to which &s;he owed &s;o
much di&s;quiet. She knew he had been pre&s;&s;ed to come
over by the Whig-noblemen, who hoped his pre&s;ence
would inflame the people to &s;ome de&s;perate attempt upon
the new mini&s;try: &s;he was not ignorant that he held pri|vate
conferences with the Duke of Marlborough, the
Earl of Sunderland, the Lords Somers, Hallifax, and all
the chiefs of that party; and that he entered into a clo&s;e
connection with the Baron de Bothmar, the Hanover$$$
envoy, who had been very active in &s;omething the di&s;tur|bances
of the people.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="214">
&sect; XLI. Her Maje&s;ty, who had been for &s;ome time
afflicted with the gout, &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to both Hou&s;es, on
the &s;eventeenth day of January, &s;ignifying that the pleni|potentiaries
were arrived at Utrecht; and that &s;he was
employed in making preparations for an early campaign:
&s;he hoped, therefore, that the Commons would proceed in
giving the nece&s;&s;ary di&s;patch to the &s;upplies. The Lord-Trea&s;urer,
in order to demon&s;trate his attachment to the
prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, brought in a bill which had been
propo&s;ed by the Duke of Devon&s;hire, giving precedence to
the whole electoral family, as children and nephews of the
crown; and, when it was pa&s;&s;ed into an act, he &s;ent it
over to Hanover by Mr. Thomas Harley. The &s;ixteen
peers for Scotland were prevailed upon, by promi&s;e of
&s;atisfaction, to re&s;ume their &s;eats in the Upper Hou&s;e, from
which they had ab&s;ented them&s;elves &s;ince the deci&s;ion
again&s;t the patent of the Duke of Hamilton: but what|ever
pecuniary recompen&s;e they might have obtained from
the court, on which they were meanly dependent, they
received no &s;atisfaction from the parliament. The Com|mons
finding Mr. Walpole very trouble&s;ome in their Hou&s;e,
by his talents, activity, and zealous attachment to the
Whig intere&s;t, found means to di&s;cover &s;ome clande&s;tine
practices in which he was concerned as &s;ecretary at war,
with regard to the forage-contract in Scotland. The
contractors, rather than admit into their partner&s;hip a
per&s;on whom he had recommended for that purpo&s;e, cho&s;e
to pre&s;ent his friend with five hundred pounds. Their
bill was addre&s;&s;ed to Mr. Walpole, who endor&s;ed it, and
his friend touched the money<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The commi&s;&s;ioners appointed for taking, &s;tating, and examining the pub|lick accounts having made their report touching the conduct of Mr. Wal|pole, the Hou&s;e, after a long debate, came to the following re&s;olutions: 1. That Robert Walpole, E&s;q. a member of this Hou&s;e, in receiving the &s;um of five hundred guineas, and in taking a note for five hundred more, on account of two contracts for forage of her Maje&s;ty's troops, quartered in North Bri|tain, made by him when &s;ecretary at war, pur&s;uant to a power granted to him by the late Lord-Trea&s;urer, is guilty of a high breach of tru&s;t and noto|rious corruption. 2. That the &s;aid Robert Walpole, E&s;q. be for the &s;aid of|fen&s;e committed pri&s;oner to the Tower of London, during the plea&s;ure of this Hou&s;e; and that Mr. Speaker do i&s;&s;ue his warrant accordingly. 3. That the &s;aid Robert Walpole, E&s;q. be for the &s;aid offen&s;e al&s;o expelled the Hou&s;e, and that the report of the commi&s;&s;ioners of publick accounts be taken into further con&s;ideration that day &s;e'nnight.&mdash;It appeared from the depo&s;itions of witne&s;&s;es that the publick had been defrauded con&s;iderably by the contracts&mdash;a very &s;evere &s;peech was made in the Hou&s;e, and next day publi&s;hed, reflecting upon Mr. Walpole, as guilty of the wor&s;t kind of corruption; and Sir Peter King declared in the Hou&s;e, that he de&s;erved hanging as well as he de&s;erved impri&s;onment and expul&s;ion.</NOTE>. This tran&s;action was
<PB N="209" REF="215">
interpreted into a bribe. Mr. Walpole was voted guilty
of corruption, impri&s;oned in the Tower, and expelled the
Hou&s;e. Being afterwards recho&s;en by the &s;ame borough of
Lynn-Regis, which he had before repre&s;ented, a petition
was lodged again&s;t him, and the Commons voted him in|capable
of being elected a member to &s;erve in the pre&s;ent
parliament.</P>
<P>&sect; XLII. Their next attack was upon the Duke of Marl|borough,
who was found to have received a yearly &s;um
from Sir Solomon Medina, a Jew, concerned in the con|tract
for furni&s;hing the army with bread; to have been
gratified by the Queen with ten thou&s;and pounds a year
to defray the expen&s;e of intelligence; and to have pocket|ed
a deduction of two and a half per cent. from the pay
of the foreign troops maintained by England. It was
alledged, in his ju&s;tification, that the pre&s;ent from the
Jews was a cu&s;tomary perqui&s;ite, which had always been
enjoyed by the general of the Dutch army: that the de|duction
of two and a half per cent. was granted to him by
an expre&s;s warrant from her Maje&s;ty: that all the articles
of the charge joined together did not exceed thirty thou|&s;and
pounds, a &s;um which inferior to that which had been
allowed to King William for contingencies: that the
money was expended in procuring intelligence, which was
&s;o exact that the Duke was never &s;urpri&s;ed: that none of
his parties were ever intercepted or cut off; and all his
de&s;igns were by the&s;e means &s;o well concerted, that he never
once mi&s;carried. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e repre&s;entations
the majority voted that his practices had been unwarrant|able
<PB N="210" REF="216">
and illegal; and that the deduction was to be account|ed
for as publick money. The&s;e re&s;olutions were com|municated
to the Queen, who ordered the Attorney-Gene|ral
to pro&s;ecute the Duke for the money he had deducted
by virtue of her own warrant. Such practices were cer|tainly
mean and mercenary, and greatly tarni&s;hed the glory
which the Duke had acquired by his military talents, and
other &s;hining qualities.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIII. The Commons now directed the &s;treams of
their re&s;entment again&s;t the Dutch, who had certainly
exerted all their endeavours to overwhelm the new mini|&s;try,
and retard the negociations for peace. They main|tained
an intimate corre&s;pondence with the Whigs of Eng|land.
They diffu&s;ed the mo&s;t invidious reports again&s;t
Oxford and Secretary St. John. Buys, their envoy at
London, acted the part of an incendiary, in &s;ugge&s;ting
violent mea&s;ures to the malcontents, and caballing again&s;t
the government. The mini&s;ters, by way of repri&s;al, in|fluenced
the Hou&s;e of Commons to pa&s;s &s;ome acrimonious
re&s;olutions again&s;t the States-General. They alledged
that the States had been deficient in their proportion of
troops, both in Spain and in the Netherlands, during the
whole cour&s;e of the war; and that the Queen had paid
above three millions of crowns in &s;ub&s;idies, above what
&s;he was obliged to advance by her engagements. They
attacked the barrier treaty, which had been concluded
with the States by Lord Town&s;hend, after the confer|ences
at Gertruydenberg. By this agreement, England
guaranteed a barrier in the Netherlands to the Dutch:
and the States bound them&s;elves to maintain, with their
whole force, the Queen's title, and the prote&s;tant &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion.
The Tories affirmed that England was di&s;graced
by engaging any other &s;tate to defend a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion which
the nation might &s;ee cau&s;e to alter: that, by this treaty,
the States were authori&s;ed to interpo&s;e in Briti&s;h councils
that being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all tho&s;e &s;trong towns, they might
exclude the Engli&s;h from trading to them, and interfere
with the manufactures of Great-Britain. The Hou&s;e of
<PB N="211" REF="217">
Commons voted, That in the barrier treaty there were
&s;everal articles de&s;tructive to the trade and intere&s;t of
Great-Britain; and therefore highly di&s;honourable to her
Maje&s;ty: That the Lord Vi&s;count Town&s;hend was not
authori&s;ed to conclude &s;everal articles in that treaty:
That he and all tho&s;e who had advi&s;ed its being ratified
were enemies to the Queen and kingdom. All their votes
were dige&s;ted into a long repre&s;entation pre&s;ented to the
Queen, in which they averred that England, during the war,
had been overcharged nineteen millions; a circum&s;tance
that implied mi&s;management or fraud in the old mini&s;try.
The States, alarmed at the&s;e re&s;olutions, wrote a re&s;pect|ful
letter to the Queen, repre&s;enting the nece&s;&s;ity of a
barrier, for the mutual &s;ecurity of England and the United
Provinces. They afterwards drew up a large memorial
in vindication of their proceedings during the war; and
it was publi&s;hed in one of the Engli&s;h papers. The Com|mons
immediately voted it a fal&s;e, &s;candalous, and ma|licious
libel, reflecting upon the re&s;olutions of the Hou&s;e;
and the printer the publi&s;her were taken into cu&s;tody, as
guilty of a breach of privilege.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIV. They now repealed the naturalization act.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet.</NOTE>
They pa&s;&s;ed a bill granting a toleration to the epi&s;co|pal
clergy in Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Boyer.</NOTE> without paying the lea&s;t regard

proceeded with the bill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tindal.</NOTE> and in&s;erted a clau&s;e
prohibiting civil magi&s;trates from executing the &s;entences
of the kirk-judicatories.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi&s;t. of the D. of Marl|borough.</NOTE> The epi&s;copal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mil. Hi&s;t.</NOTE> as well as the
pre&s;byterian clergy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Voltaire.</NOTE> were required to take the oath of ab|juration,
that they might be upon an equal footing in
ca&s;e of di&s;obedience; for the Commons well knew that
this condition would be rejected by both, from very differ|ent
motives. In order to exa&s;perate the pre&s;byterians
with further provocations, another act was pa&s;&s;ed for di&s;|continuing
the courts of judicature during the Chri&s;tmas
<PB N="212" REF="218">
holidays, which had never been kept by per&s;ons of that
per&s;ua&s;ions. When this bill was read for the third time,
Sir David Dalrymple &s;aid, &startq;Since the Hou&s;e is re&s;olved
to make no alteration in the body of this bill, I acqui|e&s;ee;
and only de&s;ire it may be intituled, A bill for
e&s;tabli&s;hing jacobiti&s;m and immorality.&endq; The chagrin
of the Scotti&s;h pre&s;byterians was completed by a third
bill, re&s;toring the right of patronage, which had been
taken away when the di&s;cipline of the kirk was la&s;t e&s;ta|bli&s;hed.
Prince Eugene having pre&s;ented a memorial to
the Queen, touching the conduct of the Emperor during
the war, and containg a propo&s;al with relation to the
affairs of Spain, the Queen communicated the &s;cheme to
the Hou&s;e of Commons, who treated it with the mo&s;t con|temptuous
neglect. The Prince, finding all his efforts in|effectual,
retired to the continent, as much di&s;plea&s;ed with
the mini&s;try, as he had rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied with the peo|ple
of England. The Commons having &s;ettled the funds
for the &s;upplies of the year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1712.</NOTE> amounting to &s;ix millions;
the Trea&s;urer formed the plan of a bill appointing commi&s;|&s;ioners
to examine the value and con&s;ideration of all the
grants made &s;ince the Revolution. His de&s;ign was to make
a general re&s;umption; but, as the intere&s;t of &s;o many
noblemen was concerned, the bill met with a very warm
oppo&s;ition; notwith&s;tanding which, it would have cer|tainly
pa&s;&s;ed, had not the Duke of Buckingham and the
Earl of Strafford ab&s;ented them&s;elves from the Hou&s;e

<PB N="214" REF="220">
<P>&sect; 1. IN the month of January the conferences for peace
began at Utrecht.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK I. 1712.</NOTE> The Earl of Jer&s;ey would
have been appointed the plenipotentiary for England, but
he dying after the corre&s;pondence with the court of France
was e&s;tabli&s;hed, the Queen conferred that charge upon
Robin&s;on, Bi&s;hop of Bri&s;tol, Lord Privy-Seal, and the
Earl of Strafford. The chief of the Dutch deputies named
for the congre&s;s, were Buys and Vanderdu&s;&s;en: the French
King granted his powers to the Mare&s;chal D'Uxelles,
the Abbot (afterwards Cardinal) de Polignac, and Mena|ger,
who had been in England. The mini&s;ters of the Em|peror
and Savoy likewi&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the conferences, to
which the empire and the other allies likewi&s;e &s;ent their,
plenipotentiaries, though not without reluctance. As all
the&s;e powers, except France, entertained &s;entiments very
different from tho&s;e of her Britannick Maje&s;ty, the con|ferences
&s;eemed calculated rather to retard than accelerate
a pacification. The Queen of England had fore&s;een and
<PB N="215" REF="221">
provided again&s;t the&s;e difficulties.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XI. 1712.</NOTE> Her great end was to
free her &s;ubjects from the mi&s;eries attending an unprofit|able
war, and to re&s;tore peace to Europe; and this aim
&s;he was re&s;olved to accompli&s;h, in &s;pite of all oppo&s;ition.
She had al&s;o determined to procure rea&s;onable terms of ac|commodation
for her allies, without, however, continuing
to lavi&s;h the blood and trea&s;ure of her people in &s;upporting
their extravagant demands. The Emperor ob&s;tinately in|&s;i&s;ted
upon his claim to the whole Spani&s;h monarchy, re|fu&s;ing
to give up the lea&s;t tittle of his preten&s;ions; and
the Dutch adhered to the old preliminaries which Louis
had formerly rejected. The Queen &s;aw that the liberties
of Europe would be expo&s;ed to much greater danger from
an actual union of the Imperial and Spani&s;h crowns in
one head of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, than from a bare
po&s;&s;ibility of Spain's being united with France in one
branch of the Hou&s;e of Bourbon. She knew by ex|perience
the difficulty of dethroning Philip, rooted as
he was in the affections of a brave and loyal people;
and that a pro&s;ecution of this de&s;ign would &s;erve no pur|po&s;e
but to protract the war, and augment the griev|ances
of the Briti&s;h nation. She was well acquainted
with the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the French, which &s;he con&s;idered
as pledges of their monarch's &s;incerity. She &s;ought not
the total ruin of that people, already reduced to the brink
of de&s;pair. The dictates of true policy di&s;&s;uaded her from
contributing to further conque&s;ts in that kingdom, which
would have proved the &s;ource of contention among the
allies, depre&s;&s;ed the Hou&s;e of Bourbon below that &s;tan|dard
of importance which the balance of Europe required
it &s;hould maintain, and aggrandize the States-General at
the expen&s;e of Great-Britain. As &s;he had bor'n the chief
burthen of the war, &s;he had a right to take the lead; and
dictate a plan of pacification: at lea&s;t, &s;he had a right to
con&s;ult the welfare of her own kingdom, in delivering,
by a &s;eparate peace, her &s;ubjects from tho&s;e enormous loads
which they could no longer &s;u&s;tain; and &s;he was well
<PB N="216" REF="222">
enough aware of her own con&s;equence, to think &s;he could
obtain advantageous conditions.</P>
<P>&sect; II. Such were the &s;entiments of the Queen; and her
mini&s;ters &s;eem to have acted on the &s;ame principles, though,
perhaps, party motives may have helped to influence their
conduct. The allies concurred in oppo&s;ing with all their
might any treaty which could not gratify their different
views of avarice, intere&s;t, and ambition. They practi&s;ed
a thou&s;and little artifices to intimidate the Queen, to ex|cite
a jealou&s;y of Louis, to blacken the characters of her
mini&s;ters, to rai&s;e and keep up a dangerous ferment among
her people, by which her life and government were en|dangered.
She could not fail to re&s;ent the&s;e efforts, which
greatly perplexed her mea&s;ures, and ob&s;tructed her de&s;ign.
Her mini&s;ters were &s;en&s;ible of the dangerous predicament
in which they &s;tood. The Queen's health was much im|paired; and the &s;ucce&s;&s;or countenanced the oppo&s;ite &s;ac|tion.
In ca&s;e of their &s;overeign's death they had nothing
to expect but pro&s;ecution and ruin for obeying her com|mands:
they &s;aw no hope of &s;afety, except in renouncing
their principles, and &s;ubmitting to their adver&s;aries, or el&s;e
in taking &s;uch mea&s;ures as would ha&s;ten the pacification,
that the troubles of the kingdom might be appea&s;ed, and the
people be &s;atisfied with their conduct before death &s;hould
deprive them of their &s;overeign's protection. With this
view they advi&s;ed her to &s;et on foot a private negociation
with Louis; to &s;tipulate certain advantages for her own
&s;ubjects in a concerted plan of peace; to enter into &s;uch
mutual confidence with that monarch, as would anticipate
all clande&s;tine tran&s;actions to her prejudice, and in &s;ome
mea&s;ure enable her pre&s;cribe terms for her to allies. The
plan was judiciou&s;ly formed: but executed with too much
precipitation. The &s;tipulated advantages were not &s;uch
as &s;he had a right to demand and in&s;i&s;t upon; and with|out
all doubt, better might have been obtained, had not
the ob&s;tinacy of the allies abroad, and the violent conduct
of the Whig faction at home, obliged the mini&s;ters to
<PB N="217" REF="223">
relax in &s;ome material points, and ha&s;ten the conclu&s;ion of
the treaty.</P>
<P>&sect; III. The articles being privately regulated between the
two courts of London and Ver&s;ailles, the Engli&s;h plenipo|tentiaries
at Utrecht were furni&s;hed with general powers
and in&s;tructions, being ignorant of the agreement which
the Queen had made with the French monarch, touching
the kingdom of Spain, which was indeed the ba&s;is of the
treaty. This &s;ecret plan of negociation, however, had
well nigh been de&s;troyed by &s;ome unfore&s;een events that
were doubly afflicting to Louis. The Dauphin had died
of the &s;mall-pox in the cour&s;e of the preceding year, and
his title had been con&s;erred upon his &s;on, the Duke of
Burgundy, who now expired on the la&s;t day of February,
&s;ix days after the death of his wife, Mary Adelaide of
Savoy. The parents were &s;oon followed to the grave by
their elde&s;t offspring, the Duke of Bretagne, in the &s;ixth
year of his age; &s;o that of the Duke of Burgundy's chil|dren,
none remained alive but the Duke of Anjou, the
late French king, who was at that time a &s;ickly infant.
Such a &s;eries of calamities could not fail of being extremely
&s;hocking to Louis in his old age; but they were &s;till more
alarming to the Queen of England, who &s;aw that nothing
but the precarious life of an unhealthy child divided the
two monarchies of France and Spain, the union of which
&s;he re&s;olved by all po&s;&s;ible means to prevent. She, there|fore,
&s;ent the Abb&eacute; Gualtier to Paris, with a memorial,
repre&s;enting the danger to which the liberty of Europe
would be expo&s;ed, &s;hould Philip a&s;cend the throne of
France; and demanding, that his title &s;hould be tran&s;|ferred
to his brother, the Duke of Berry, in con&s;equence of
his pure, &s;imple, and voluntary renunciation.</P>
<P>&sect; IV. Mean while the French plenipotentiaries at
Utrecht were prevailed upon to deliver their propo&s;als
in writing, under the name of &s;pecifick offers, which the allies
received with indignation. They were treated in England
with univer&s;al &s;corn. Lord Hallifax, in the Hou&s;e of
Peers, termed them trifling, arrogant, and injurious to her
<PB N="218" REF="224">
Maje&s;ty and her allies: an addre&s;s was pre&s;ented to the
Queen, in which they expre&s;&s;ed their re&s;entment again&s;t
the in&s;olence of France, and promi&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t her with all
their power in pro&s;ecuting the war, until a &s;afe and ho|nourable
peace &s;hould be obtained. The plenipotentiaries
of the allies were not le&s;s extravagant in their &s;pecifick de|mands
than the French had been arrogant in their offers.
In a word, the mini&s;ters &s;eemed to have been a&s;&s;embled
at Utrecht, rather to &s;tart new difficulties, and widen the
breach, than to heal animo&s;ities, and concert a plan of
pacification. They amu&s;ed one another with fruitle&s;s
conferences, while the Queen of Great-Britain endeavoured
to engage the States-General in her mea&s;ures, that they
might treat with France upon moderate terms, and give
law to the re&s;t of the allies. She departed from &s;ome of
her own preten&s;ions, in order to gratify them with the
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome towns in Flanders. She con&s;ented to
their being admitted into a participation of &s;ome advan|tages
in commerce; and ordered the Engli&s;h mini&s;ters at
the congre&s;s to tell them, that &s;he would take her mea&s;ures
according to the return they &s;hould make on this occa|&s;ion.
Finding them &s;till ob&s;tinately attached to their fir&s;t
chimerical preliminaries, &s;he gave them to under&s;tand, that
all her offers for adju&s;ting the differences were founded
upon the expre&s;s condition, That they &s;hould come into
her mea&s;ures, and co-operate with her openly and &s;in|cerely:
but they had made &s;uch bad returns to all her
conde&s;cen&s;ion towards them, that &s;he looked upon her&s;elf
as relea&s;ed from all engagements. The mini&s;ters of the
allies had in&s;i&s;ted upon a written an&s;wer to their &s;pecifick
demands; and this the French plenipotentiaries declined,
until they &s;hould receive fre&s;h in&s;tructions from their ma|&s;ter.
Such was the pretence for &s;u&s;pending the confer|ences:
but the real bar to a final agreement between
England and France, was the delay of Philip's renunciation,
which at length, however, arrived; and produced a ce&s;&s;ation
of arms.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="225">
&sect; V. In the mean time the Duke of Ormond, who was
now inve&s;ted with the &s;upreme command of the Briti&s;h
forces, received a particular order, that he &s;hould not
hazard an engagement. Louis had already undertaken
for the compliance of his grand&s;on. Reflecting on his own
great age, he was &s;hocked at the pro&s;pect of leaving his
kingdom involved in a pernicious war during a minority;
and determined to procure a peace at all events. The
Queen, knowing his motives, could not help believing his
prote&s;tations, and re&s;olved to avoid a battle, the i&s;&s;ue of
which might have con&s;iderably altered the &s;ituation of
affairs, and con&s;equently retarded the conclu&s;ion of the
treaty. Preparations had been made for an early campaign.
In the beginning of March, the Earl of Albemarle, having
a&s;&s;embled a body of thirty-&s;ix battalions, marched towards
Arras, which he reduced to a heap of a&s;hes by a mo&s;t ter|rible
cannonading and bombardment. In May, the Duke
of Ormond conferred with the deputies of the States-Ge|neral
at the Hague, and a&s;&s;ured them that he had orders
to act vigorou&s;ly in the pro&s;ecution of the war. He
joined Prince Eugene at Tournay; and, on the twenty-&s;ixth
day of May, the allied army, pa&s;&s;ing the Schelde, en|camped
at Ha&s;pre and Solemnes. The Imperial general
propo&s;ed that they &s;hould attack the French army under
Villars: but by this time the Duke was re&s;trained from
hazarding &s;iege or battle: a circum&s;tance well known to
the French commander, who therefore abated of his u&s;ual
vigilance. It could not be long concealed from Prince
Eugene and the deputies, who forthwith di&s;patched an
expre&s;s to their principals on this &s;ubject, and afterwards
pre&s;ented a long memorial to the Duke, repre&s;enting the
injury which the grand alliance would &s;u&s;tain from his
obedience of &s;uch an order. He &s;eemed to be extremely
unea&s;y at his &s;ituation; and, in a letter to Secretary St.
John, expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire that the Queen would permit him
to return to England.</P>
<P>&sect; VI. Prince Eugene, notwith&s;tanding the Queen's
order, which Ormond had not yet formally declared,
<PB N="220" REF="226">
inve&s;ted the town of Que&s;noy, and the Duke furni&s;hed to|wards
this enterpri&s;e &s;even battalions and nine &s;quadrons
of the foreign troops maintained by Great-Britain. The
Dutch deputies at Utrecht expo&s;tulating with the Bi&s;hop
of Bri&s;tol upon the Duke's refu&s;ing to act again&s;t the
enemy, that prelate told them, that he had lately received
an expre&s;s, with a letter from her Maje&s;ty, in which &s;he
complained, that as the States-General had not properly
an&s;wered her advances, they ought not to be &s;urpri&s;ed, if
&s;he thought her&s;elf at liberty to enter into &s;eparate mea|&s;ures,
in order to obtain a peace for her own conveniency.
When they remon&s;trated again&s;t &s;uch conduct, as contra|dictory
to all the alliances &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the Queen
and the States-General, the Bi&s;hop declared his in&s;truc|tions
further imported, that con&s;idering the conduct of the
States towards her Maje&s;ty, &s;he thought her&s;elf di&s;engaged
from all alliances and engagements with their High-Mighti|ne&s;&s;es.
The States and the mini&s;ters of the allies were in|&s;tantly
in commotion. Private mea&s;ures were concerted
with the Elector of Hanover, the Landgrave of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el,
and &s;ome other princes of the empire, concerning
the troops belonging to tho&s;e powers in the pay of Great-Britain.
The States General wrote a long letter to the
Queen, and ordered their envoy at London to deliver it
into her own hand. Count Zinzendorf, the Emperor's
plenipotentiary, di&s;patched expre&s;&s;es to his ma&s;ter, to
Prince Eugene, and to the Imperial amba&s;&s;ador at Lon|don.
The Queen had a council at Ken&s;ington upon the
&s;ubject of the letter; and a fre&s;h order was &s;ent to the
Duke of Ormond, directing him to concur with the general
of the allies in a &s;iege.</P>
<P>&sect; VII. On the twenty-eighth day of May, Lord Halli|fax,
in the Hou&s;e of Peers, de&s;canted upon the ill con&s;e|quences
of the Duke's refu&s;ing to co-operate with Prince
Eugene; and moved for an addre&s;s, de&s;iring her Maje&s;ty
would order the General to act offen&s;ively, in concert with
her allies. The Trea&s;urer ob&s;erved it was the prudent to avoid
a battle on the eve of a peace, e&s;pecially con&s;idering they
<PB N="221" REF="227">
had to do with an enemy &s;o apt to break his word. The
Earl of Wharton replied, this was a &s;trong rea&s;on for
keeping no mea&s;ures with &s;uch an enemy. When Ox|ford
declared, that the Duke of Ormond had received
orders to join the allies in a &s;iege, the Duke of Marl|borough
affirmed it was impo&s;&s;ible to carry on a &s;iege
without either hazarding a battle, in ca&s;e the enemy
&s;hould attempt to relieve the place, or &s;hamefully aban|doning
the enterpri&s;e. The Duke of Argyle having de|clared
his opinion, that &s;ince the time of Julius Cae&s;ar
there had not been a greater captain than Prince Eugene
of Savoy, ob&s;erved, that, con&s;idering the different intere&s;ts
of the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria and of Great-Britain, it might
not con&s;i&s;t with prudence to tru&s;t him with the manage|ment
of the war, becau&s;e a battle won or lo&s;t might en|tirely
break off a negociation of peace, which in all pro|bability
was near being concluded. He added, that two
years before, the confederates might have taken Arras and
Cambray, in&s;tead of amu&s;ing them&s;elves with the in&s;ig|nificant
conque&s;ts of Aire, Bethune, and St. Venant.
The Duke of Devon&s;hire &s;aid he was, by proximity of
blood, more concerned than any other in the reputation of
the Duke of Ormond; and, therefore, could not help ex|pre&s;&s;ing
his &s;urpri&s;e, that any one would dare to make a
nobleman of the fir&s;t rank, and of &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed a cha|racter,
the in&s;trument of &s;uch proceedings. Earl Paulet
an&s;wered, that nobody could doubt the Duke of Ormond's
courage; but he was not like a certain general, who
led troops to the &s;laughter, to cau&s;e a great number of
officers to be knocked on the head, that he might fill his
pockets by di&s;po&s;ing of their commi&s;&s;ions. The Duke of
Marlborough was &s;o deeply affected by this reflection,
that though he &s;uppre&s;&s;ed his re&s;entment in the Hou&s;e, he
took the fir&s;t opportunity to &s;end Lord Mohun to the
Earl with a me&s;&s;age, importing, that he &s;hould be glad to
$ome to an explanation with his lord&s;hip, about &s;ome
expre&s;&s;ions he had u&s;ed in that day's debate; and de&s;iring
$is company to take the air in the country. The Earl
<PB N="222" REF="228">
under&s;tood his meaning; but could not conceal his emo|tion
from the ob&s;ervation of his lady, by who&s;e means
the affair was communicated to the Earl of Dartmouth,
&s;ecretary of &s;tate. Two centinels were immediately
placed at his lord&s;hip's gate: the Queen, by the canal of
Lord Dartmouth, de&s;ired the Duke of Marlborough would
proceed no farther in the quarrel; and he a&s;&s;ured her he
would punctually obey her Maje&s;ty's commands. The
Earl of Oxford a&s;&s;ured the Hou&s;e, that a &s;eparate peace
was never intended: that &s;uch a peace would be &s;o ba&s;e,
&s;o knavi&s;h, and &s;o villainous, that every one who &s;erved
the Queen knew they mu&s;t an&s;wer it with their heads to
the nation; but that it would appear to be a &s;afe and glo|rious
peace, much more to the honour and intere&s;t of
the nation than the fir&s;t preliminaries in&s;i&s;ted upon by the
allies. The que&s;tion being put for adjourning was, after a
long debate, carried in the affirmative; but twenty lords en|tered
a prote&s;t. The Earl of Strafford, who had returned
from Holland, propo&s;ed, that they &s;hould examine the
negociations of the Hague and Gertruydenberg, before they
con&s;idered that of Utrecht. He ob&s;erved, that in the
former negociations the French mini&s;ters had conferred
only with the Pen&s;ionary, who communicated no more of
it to the mini&s;ters of the allies than what was judged pro|per
to let them know: &s;o that the Dutch were ab&s;olute
ma&s;ters of the &s;ecret. He a&s;&s;erted, that the States-General
had con&s;ented to give Naples and Sicily to King Philip:
a circum&s;tance which proved that the recovery of the
whole Spani&s;h monarchy was looked upon as impracticable.
He concluded with a motion for an addre&s;s to her Maje&s;ty,
de&s;iring that the papers relating to the negociations of the
Hague and Gertruydenberg &s;hould be laid before the Hou&s;e.
This was carried without a divi&s;ion.</P>
<P>&sect; VIII. In the Hou&s;e of Commons, Mr. Pulteney moved
for an addre&s;s, acquainting her Maje&s;ty, that her faithful
Commons were ju&s;tly alarmed at the intelligence received
from abroad, that her general in Flanders had declined
acting offen&s;ively again&s;t France, in concurrence with her
<PB N="223" REF="229">
allies; and be&s;eeching her Maje&s;ty, that he might receive
&s;peedy in&s;tructions to pro&s;ecute the war with the utmo&s;t
vigour. This motion was rejected by a great majority.
A certain member having in&s;inuated, that the pre&s;ent ne|gociation
had been carried on in a clande&s;tine and treacher|ous
manner, Mr. Secretary St. John &s;aid, he hoped it
would not be accounted treachery to act for the good and
advantage of Great-Britain: that he gloried in the &s;mall
&s;hare he had in the tran&s;action; and whatever cen&s;ure he
might undergo for it, the bare &s;atisfaction of acting in
that view would be a &s;ufficient recompen&s;e and comfort
to him during the whole cour&s;e of his life. The Hou&s;e
re&s;olved, That the Commons had an entire confidence in
her Maje&s;ty's promi&s;e, to communicate to her parliament
the terms of the peace before it &s;hould be concluded;
and, That they would &s;upport her again&s;t all &s;uch per|&s;ons,
either at home or abroad, as &s;hould endeavour
to ob&s;truct the pacification. The Queen thanked them
heartily for this re&s;olution, as being dutiful to her,
hone&s;t to their country, and very &s;ea&s;onable at a time
when &s;o many artifices were u&s;ed to ob&s;truct a good
peace, or to force one di&s;advantageous to Britain. They
likewi&s;e pre&s;ented an addre&s;s, de&s;iring they might have
an account of the negociations and tran&s;actions at the
Hague and Gertruydenberg, and know who were then
employed as her Maje&s;ty's plenipotentiaries.</P>
<P>&sect; IX. The mini&s;try, fore&s;eeing that Philip would not
willingly re&s;ign his hopes of &s;ucceeding to the crown of
France, propo&s;ed an alternative, that, in ca&s;e of his pre|ferring
his expectation of the crown of France to the pre|&s;ent
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Spain, this kingdom, with the Indies,
&s;hould be forthwith ceded to the Duke of Savoy; that
Philip, in the mean time, &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s the Duke's here|ditary
dominions, and the kingdom of Sicily, together
with Mont$errat and Mantua; all which territories
&s;hould be annexed to France at Philip's &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to that
crown, except Sicily, which &s;hould revert to the Hou&s;e of
Au&s;tria. Louis &s;eemed to reli&s;h this expedient, which,
<PB N="224" REF="230">
however, was rejected by Philip, who cho&s;e to make the
renunciation, rather than quit the throne upon which he
was e&s;tabli&s;hed. The Queen demanded, that the renun|ciation
&s;hould be ratified in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner by
the &s;tates of France; but &s;he afterwards waved this de|mand,
in con&s;ideration of its being regi&s;tered in the dif|ferent
parliaments. Such forms are but &s;lender &s;ecurities
again&s;t the power, ambition, and intere&s;t of princes. The
Marquis de Tor$y frankly owned, that Philip's renun|ciation
was of it&s;elf void, as being contrary to the funda|mental
laws and con&s;titution of the French monarchy;
but it was found nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;atisfaction of the Eng|li&s;h
people. Every material article being now adju&s;ted be|tween
the two courts, particularly tho&s;e relating to the
King of Spain, the commerce of Great-Britain, and the
delivery of Dunkirk, a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms prevailed in
the Netherlands, and the Duke of Ormond acted in con|cert
with Mare&s;chal de Villars.</P>
<P>&sect; X. On the &s;ixth day of June the Queen going to the
Hou&s;e of Peers, communicated the plan of peace to her
parliament, according to the promi&s;e &s;he had made. Af|ter
having premi&s;ed, that the making peace and war was
the undoubted prerogative of the crown, and hinted at
the difficulties which had ari&s;en both from the nature of
the affair, and numberle&s;s ob&s;tructions contrived by the
enemies of peace, &s;he proceeded to enumerate the chief
articles to which both crowns had agreed, without, how|ever,
concluding the treaty. She told them &s;he had &s;e|cured
the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, which France had ac|knowledged
in the &s;tronge&s;t terms; and that the Pre|tender
would be removed from the French dominions;
that the Duke of Anjoy &s;hould renounce for him&s;elf and
his de&s;cendants all claim to the crown of France; &s;o that
the two monarchies would be for ever divided. She ob|&s;erved,
that the nature of this propo&s;al was &s;uch as would
execute it&s;elf: that it would be the intere&s;t of Spain to
&s;upport the renunciation; and in France, the per&s;ons
intitled to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of that crown upon the death of
<PB N="225" REF="231">
the Dauphin were powerful enough to vindicate their
own right. She gave them to under&s;tand, that a treaty
of commerce between England and France had been be|gun,
though not yet adju&s;ted; but provi&s;ion was made,
that England &s;hould enjoy the &s;ame privileges that France
granted to the mo&s;t favoured nation: that the French
King had agreed to make an ab&s;olute ce&s;&s;ion of the i&s;land
of St. Chri&s;topher's, which had hitherto been divided
between the two nations: that he had al&s;o con&s;ented to
re&s;tore the whole bay and &s;traits of Hud&s;on; to deliver
the i&s;land of Newfoundland, with Placentia; to cede An|napolis,
with the re&s;t of Acadia or Nova-Scotia; to de|moli&s;h
the fortifications of Dunkirk; to leave England
in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Gibraltar, Port-Mahon, and the whole
i&s;land of Minorca; to let the trade of Spain in the We&s;t-Indies
be &s;ettled as it was in the reign of his late Catholick
Maje&s;ty: &s;he &s;ignified that &s;he had obtained for her &s;ub|jects
the a&s;&s;iento, or contract for furni&s;hing the Spani&s;h
We&s;t-Indies with negroes, for the term of thirty years,
in the &s;ame manner as it had been enjoyed by the French.
With re&s;pect to the allies, &s;he declared, that France of|fered
to make the Rhine the barrier of the empire: to
yield Bri&s;ac, Fort Kehl, and Landau, and raze all the
fortre&s;&s;es both on the other &s;ide of the Rhine, and in the
i&s;lands of that river: that the prote&s;tant intere&s;t in Ger|many
would be re&s;ettled on the footing of the treaty of
We&s;tphalia; that the Spani&s;h Netherlands, the kingdoms
of Naples and Sardinia, the duchy of Milan, and the
places belonging to Spain on the coa&s;t of Tu&s;cany might
be yielded to his Imperial Maje&s;ty; but the di&s;po&s;ition
of Sicily was not yet determined: that the demands of
the States-General with relation to commerce, and the
barrier in the Low-Countries, would be granted with a
few exceptions, which might be compen&s;ated by other
expedients: that no great progre&s;s had yet been made
upon the preten&s;ions of Portugal; but that tho&s;e of
Pru&s;&s;ia would be admitted by France without much diffi|culty:
that the difference between the barrier demanded
<PB N="226" REF="232">
by the Duke of Savoy in the year one thou&s;and &s;even
hundred and nine, and that which France now offered,
was very incon&s;iderable: that the Elector Palatine &s;hould
maintain his pre&s;ent rank among the Electors; and that
France would acknowledge the electral dignity in the
hou&s;e of Hanover. Such were the conditions which
the Queen hoped would make &s;ome amends to her
&s;ubjects for the great and unequal burthen they had
bor'n during the whole cour&s;e of the war. She con|cluded
with &s;aying, &s;he made no doubt but they were
fully per&s;uaded, that nothing would be neglected on her
part, in the progre&s;s of this negociation, to bring the peace
to an happy and &s;peedy i&s;&s;ue; and &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her depen|dence
upon the entire confidence and chearful concurrence
of her parliament.</P>
<P>&sect; XI. An addre&s;s of thanks and approbation was imme|diately
voted, drawn up, and pre&s;ented to the Queen by the
Commons in a body. When the Hou&s;e of Lords took the
&s;peech into con&s;ideration, the Duke of Marlborough
a&s;&s;erted, that the mea&s;ures pur&s;ued for a year pa&s;t were
directly contrary to her Maje&s;ty's engagements with the
allies: that they &s;ullied the triumphs and glories of her
reign; and would render the Engli&s;h name odious to all
nations. The Earl of Strafford &s;aid, that &s;ome of the
allies would not have &s;hown &s;uch backwardne&s;s to a peace,
had they not been per&s;uaded and encouraged to carry on
the war by a member of that illu&s;trious a&s;&s;embly, who
maintained a &s;ecret corre&s;pondence with them, and fed
them with hopes that they would be &s;upported by a &s;trong
party in England. In an&s;wer to this in&s;inuation again&s;t
Marlborough, Lord Cowper ob&s;erved, that it could never
be &s;ugge&s;ted as a crime in the meane&s;t &s;ubject, much le&s;s
in any member of that augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly, to hold corre&s;|pondence
with the allies of the nation; &s;uch allies, e&s;peci|ally,
who&s;e intere&s;t her Maje&s;ty had declared to be in&s;epa|rable
from her own, in her &s;peech at the opening of the
&s;e&s;&s;ion; whereas it would be a hard matter to ju&s;tify and
reconcile either with our laws, or with the laws of honour
<PB N="227" REF="233">
and ju&s;tice, the conduct of &s;ome per&s;ons, in treating
clande&s;tinely with the common enemy, without the parti|cipation
of the allies. This was a frivolous argument. A
corre&s;pondence with any per&s;on what&s;oever becomes cri|minal,
when it tends to foment the divi&s;ions of one's
country, and arm the people again&s;t their &s;overeign. If
England had it not in her power, without infringing the
laws of ju&s;tice and honour, to withdraw her&s;elf from a
confederacy which &s;he could no longer &s;upport, and treat
for peace on her own bottom, then was &s;he not an a&s;&s;ociate
but a &s;lave to the alliance. The Earl of Godolphin
affirmed, that the trade to Spain was &s;uch a trifle as de|&s;erved
no con&s;ideration; and that it would continually
dimini&s;h, until it &s;hould be entirely engro&s;&s;ed by the French
merchants. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e remon&s;trances again&s;t
the plan of peace, the majority agreed to an addre&s;s, in
which they thanked the Queen for her extraordinary con|de&s;cen&s;ion
in communicating tho&s;e conditions to her par|liament;
and expre&s;&s;ed an entire &s;atisfaction with her con|duct.
A motion was made for a clau&s;e in the addre&s;s,
de&s;iring her Maje&s;ty would take &s;uch mea&s;ures, in concert
with her allies, as might induce them to join with her in a
mutual guarantee. A debate en&s;ued: the que&s;tion was
put, and the clau&s;e rejected. Several noblemen entered a
prote&s;t, which was expunged from the journals of the
Hou&s;e by the deci&s;ion of the majority.</P>
<P>&sect; XII. In the Hou&s;e of Commons, a complaint was ex|hibited
again&s;t Bi&s;hop Fleetwood, who, in a preface to
four &s;ermons which he had publi&s;hed, took occa&s;ion to
extol the la&s;t mini&s;try, at the expen&s;e of the pre&s;ent ad|mini&s;tration.
This piece was voted malicious and factious,
tending to create di&s;cord and &s;edition among&s;t her Ma|je&s;ty's
&s;ubjects, and condemned to be burned by the hands
of the common hangman. They pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to
the Queen, a&s;&s;uring her of the ju&s;t &s;en&s;e they had of the
indignity offered to her, by printing and publi&s;hing a letter
from the States-General to her Maje&s;ty; and de&s;iring &s;he
would &s;o far re&s;ent &s;uch in&s;ults, as to give no an&s;wer for
<PB N="228" REF="234">
the future to any letters or memorials that &s;hould be thus
u&s;hered into the world, as inflammatory appeals to the pub|lick.
Mr. Hampden moved for an addre&s;s to her Maje&s;ty,
that &s;he would give particular in&s;tructions to her plenipo|tentiaries,
that in the conclu&s;ion of the treaty of peace,
the &s;everal powers in alliance with her Maje&s;ty might be
guarantees for the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the illu&s;trious
hou&s;e of Hanover. The que&s;tion being put, was carried
in the negative. Then the Hou&s;e re&s;olved, That they
had &s;uch confidence in the repeated declarations her Ma|je&s;ty
had made of her concern for a&s;&s;uring to the&s;e king|doms
the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed, that
they could never doubt of her taking the proper mea&s;ures
for the &s;ecurity thereof: that the Hou&s;e would &s;upport her
again&s;t faction at home and her enemies abroad; and did
humbly be&s;eech her, that &s;he would be plea&s;ed to di&s;|countenance
all tho&s;e who &s;hould endeavour to rai&s;e
jealou&s;ies between her Maje&s;ty and her &s;ubjects, e&s;pe|cially
by mi&s;repre&s;enting her good intentions for the welfare
of her people. The Queen was extremely plea&s;ed with
this re&s;olution. When it was pre&s;ented, &s;he told them
that they had &s;hown them&s;elves hone&s;t a&s;&s;erters of the
monarchy, zealous defenders of the con&s;titution, and real
friends to the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. She thought &s;he had
very little rea&s;on to countenance a compliment of &s;uper|erogation
to a prince who had caballed with the enemies
of her admini&s;tration. On the twenty-fir&s;t day of June
the Queen clo&s;ed the &s;e&s;&s;ion with a &s;peech, expre&s;&s;ing her
&s;atisfaction at the addre&s;&s;es and &s;upplies &s;he had received:
&s;he ob&s;erved, that &s;hould the treaty be broke off, their
burthens would be at lea&s;t continued, if not increa&s;ed:
that Britain would lo&s;e the pre&s;ent opportunity of improving
her own commerce, and e&s;tabli&s;hing a real balance of power
in Europe; and that though &s;ome of the allies might be
gainers by a continuance of the war, the re&s;t would &s;uffer
in the common calamity. Notwith&s;tanding the ferment of
the people, which was now ri&s;en to a very dangerous
pitch, addre&s;&s;es, approving the Queen's conduct, were
<PB N="229" REF="235">
pre&s;ented by the city of London, and all the corporations
in the kingdom that e&s;pou&s;ed the Tory-intere&s;t. At this
$uncture the nation was &s;o wholly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the &s;pirit of
party, that no appearance of neutrality or moderation re|mained.</P>
<P>&sect; XIII. During the&s;e tran&s;actions the trenches were open|ed
before Que&s;noy, and the &s;iege carried on with uncommon
vigour under cover of the forces commanded by the Duke
of Ormond. This nobleman, however, having received
a copy of the articles, &s;igned by the Marquis de Tor$y,
and fre&s;h in&s;tructions from the Queen, &s;ignified to Prince
Eugene and the Dutch deputies, that the French King
had agreed to &s;everal articles demanded by the Queen, as
the foundation of an armi&s;tice; and among others, to put
the Engli&s;h troops in immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Dunkirk: that
he could, therefore, no longer cover the &s;iege of Que&s;noy,
as he was obliged by his in&s;tructions to march with the Briti&s;h
troops, and tho&s;e in the Queen's pay, and declare a &s;u&s;|pen&s;ion
of arms as &s;oon as he &s;hould be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Dun|kirk.
He expre&s;&s;ed his hope, that they would readily ac|quie&s;ce
in the&s;e in&s;tructions, &s;eeing their concurrence
would act as the mo&s;t powerful motive to induce the Queen
to take all po&s;&s;ible care of their intere&s;ts at the congre&s;s;
and he endeavoured to demon&s;trate, that Dunkirk, as a
cautionary town, was a place of greater con&s;equence to the
allies than Que&s;noy. The deputies de&s;ired he would de|lay
his march five days, that they might have time to con|&s;ult
their principals, and he granted three days without
he&s;itation. Prince Eugene ob&s;erved, that his marching
off with the Briti&s;h troops, and the foreigners in the Queen's
pay, would leave the allies at the mercy of the enemy:
but he hoped the&s;e la&s;t would not obey the Duke's order.
He and the deputies had already tampered with their com|manding
officers, who ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to obey the Duke
of Ormond, alledging, that they could not &s;eparate from
the con&s;ederacy without expre&s;s directions from their
ma&s;ters, to whom they had di&s;patched couriers. An ex|traordinary
a&s;&s;embly of the States was immediately &s;um|moned
<PB N="230" REF="236">
to meet at the Hague. The mini&s;ters of the allies
were invited to the conferences. At length, the princes
who&s;e troops were in the pay of Britain a&s;&s;ured them,
that they would maintain them under the command of
Prince Eugene for one month at their own expen&s;e, and
afterwards &s;u&s;tain half the charge, provided the other
half &s;hould be defrayed by the Emperor and States-Gene|ral.</P>
<P>&sect; XIV. The Bi&s;hop of Bri&s;tol imparted to the other
plenipotentiaries at Utrecht the conce&s;&s;ions which France
would make to the allies; and propo&s;ed a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of
arms for two months, that they might treat in a friendly
manner, and adju&s;t the demands of all the confederates.
To this propo&s;al they made no other an&s;wer, but that they
had no in&s;tructions on the &s;ubject. Count Zinzendorf,
the fir&s;t Imperial plenipotentiary, pre&s;ented a memorial to
the States-General, explaining the danger that would re|&s;ult
to the common cau&s;e from a ce&s;&s;ation of arms; and
exhorting them to per&s;evere in their generous and vigorous
re&s;olutions. He propo&s;ed a renewal of the alliance for re|covering
the Spani&s;h monarchy to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria,
and a certain plan for pro&s;ecuting the war with redoubled
ardour. Prince Eugene, in order to dazzle the confede|rates
with &s;ome bold enterpri&s;e, detached Major-General
Grove&s;tein, with fifteen hundred cavalry, to penetrate into
the heart of France. This officer, about the middle of
June, advanced into Champagne, pa&s;&s;ed the Noire, the
Mae&s;e, the Mo&s;elle, and the Saar, and retired to Traer|bach
with a rich booty, and a great number of ho&s;tages,
after having extorted contributions as far as the gates of
Metz, ravaged the country, and reduced a great number
of villages and towns to a&s;hes. The con&s;ternation pro|duced
by this irruption reached the city of Paris: the
King of France did not think him&s;elf &s;afe at Ver&s;ailles
with his ordinary guards: all the troops in the neigh|bourhood
of the capital were a&s;&s;embled about the palace.
Villars &s;ent a detachment after Grove&s;tein, as &s;oon as he
under&s;tood his de&s;tination: but the other had gained a
<PB N="231" REF="237">
day's march of the French troops, which had the morti|fication
to follow him &s;o clo&s;e, that they found the flames
&s;till burning in the villages he had de&s;troyed. By way of
retaliation, Major-General Pa&s;teur, a French parti&s;an,
made an excur&s;ion beyond Bergen-op-zoom, and ravaged
the i&s;land of Tortole belonging to Zealand.</P>
<P>&sect; XV. The Earl of Strafford having returned to Hol|land,
propo&s;ed a ce&s;&s;ation of arms to the States-General,
by whom it was rejected. Then he proceeded to the army
of the Duke of Ormond, where he arrived in a few days
after the reduction of Que&s;noy, the garri&s;on of which were
made pri&s;oners of war on the fourth day of July. The
officers of the foreign troops had a &s;econd time refu&s;ed
to obey a written order of the Duke: and &s;uch a &s;pirit of
animo&s;ity began to prevail between the Engli&s;h and allies,
that it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to effect a &s;peedy &s;eparation.
Prince Eugene re&s;olved to undertake the &s;iege of Landrecy:
a de&s;ign is &s;aid to have been formed by the German generals
to confine the Duke, on pretence of the arrears that were due
to them; and to di&s;arm the Briti&s;h troops, left they &s;hould
join the French army. In the mean time, a literary cor|re&s;pondence
was maintained between the Engli&s;h general
and the Mare&s;chal de Villars. France having con&s;ented to
deliver up Dunkirk, a body of troops was tran&s;ported from
England, under the command of Brigadier Hill, who took
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the place on the &s;eventh day of July, the
French garri&s;on retiring to Winoxberg. On the &s;ixteenth
of the &s;ame month Prince Eugene marched from his camp
at Ha&s;pre, and was followed by all the auxiliaries in the
Briti&s;h pay, except a few battalions of the troops of Hol|&s;tein-Cottorp,
and Wale&s;'s regiment of dragoons belong|ing
to the &s;tate of Liege.</P>
<P>&sect; XVI. Landrecy was immediately inve&s;ted, while the
Duke of Ormond, with the Engli&s;h forces, removed from
Chateau-Cambre&s;is, and encamping at Ave&s;ne-le-Secq,
proclaimed by &s;ound of trumpet a ce&s;&s;ation of arms for two
months. On the &s;ame day the like armi&s;tice was declared
in the French army. The Dutch were &s;o exa&s;perated at
<PB N="232" REF="238">
the &s;ece&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h troops, that the governours
would not allow the Earl of Strafford to enter Bouchaine,
nor the Briti&s;h army to pa&s;s through Douay, though in
that town they had left a great quantity of &s;tores, together
with their general ho&s;pital. Prince Eugene and the
Dutch deputies, under&s;tanding that the Duke of Ormond
had begun his march towards Ghent, began to be in pain
for that city, and &s;ent Count Na&s;&s;au Woudenburg to
him with a written apology, condemning and di&s;avowing
the conduct of the commandants of Bouchaine and Douay:
but, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e excu&s;es, the Engli&s;h troops
afterwards met with the &s;ame treatment at Tournay, Ou|denarde,
and Li&s;le: in&s;ults which were re&s;ented by the
whole Briti&s;h nation. The Duke, however, pur&s;ued his
march, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Ghent and Bruges for the
Queen of England: then he re-enforced the garri&s;on of
Dunkirk, which he likewi&s;e &s;upplied with artillery and
ammunition. His conduct was no le&s;s agreeable to his
&s;overeign, than mortifying to the Dutch, who never
dreamed of leaving Ghent and Bruges in the hands of the
Engli&s;h, and were now fairly outwitted, and anticipated
by the motions and expedition of the Briti&s;h general.</P>
<P>&sect; XVII. The lo&s;s of the Briti&s;h forces was &s;o&oacute;n &s;evere|ly
felt in the allied army. Villars attacked a &s;eparate
body of their troops encamped at Denain, under the com|mand
of the Earl of Albemarle. Their entrenchments
were forced, and &s;eventeen battalions either killed or taken.
The Earl him&s;elf and all the &s;urviving officers were made
pri&s;oners. Five hundred waggons loaded with bread,
twelve pieces of bra&s;s cannon, a large quantity of am|munition
and provi&s;ions, a great number of hor&s;es, and a
con&s;iderable booty fell into the hands of the enemy: this
advantage they gained in &s;ight of Prince Eugene, who ad|vanced
on the other &s;ide of the Schedule to &s;u&s;tain Albe|marle;
but the bridge over that river was broke down by
accident; &s;o that he was prevented from lending the lea&s;t
a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Villars immediately inve&s;ted Marchiennes,
where the principal &s;tores of the allies were lodged. The
<PB N="233" REF="239">
place was &s;urrendered on the la&s;t day of July: and the
garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;ting of five thou&s;and men, were conducted
pri&s;oners to Valenciennes. He afterwards undertook the
&s;iege of Douay; an enterpri&s;e, in con&s;equence of which
Prince Eugene abandoned his de&s;ign on Landrecy, and
marched towards the French, in order to hazard an en|gagement.
The States, however, would not run the
ri&s;que; and the Prince had the mortification to &s;ee Douay
reduced by the enemy. He could not even prevent their
retaking Que&s;noy and Bouchain, of which places they
were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion before the tenth day of October. The
allies enjoyed no other compen&s;ation for their great lo&s;&s;es,
but the conque&s;t of Fort Knocque, which was &s;urpri&s;ed by
one of their parti&s;ans.</P>
<P>&sect; XVIII. The Briti&s;h mini&s;ters at the congre&s;s con|tinued
to pre&s;s the Dutch and other allies to join in the
armi&s;tice; but they were deaf to the propo&s;al, and con|certed
mea&s;ures for a vigorous pro&s;ecution of the war.
Then the Earl of Strafford in&s;i&s;ted upon their admitting
to the congre&s;s the plenipotentiaries of King Philip; but
he found them equally aver&s;e to this expedient. In the
beginning of Augu&s;t, Secretary St. John, now created
Lord Vi&s;count Bolingbroke, was &s;ent to the court of Ver|&s;ailles
incognito, to remove all ob&s;tructions to the treaty
between England and France. He was accompanied by
Mr. Prior and the Abb&eacute; Gualtier, treated with the mo&s;t
di&s;tingui&s;hed marks of re&s;pect, care&s;&s;ed by the French
King and the Marquis de Torcy, with whom he adju&s;ted
the principal intere&s;ts of the Duke of Savoy and the Elec|tor
of Bavaria. He &s;ettled the time and manner of the
renunciations, and agreed to a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms by &s;ea
and land for four months between the crowns of France
and England: this was accordingly proclaimed at Paris
and London. The negociation being fini&s;hed in a few
days, Bolingbroke returned to England, and Prior re|mained
as re&s;ident at the court of France. The States-General
breathed nothing but war: the Pen&s;ionary Hein|&s;ius
pronounced an oration in their a&s;&s;embly, repre&s;enting
<PB N="234" REF="240">
the impo&s;&s;ibility of concluding a peace without lo&s;ing the
fruits of all the blood and trea&s;ure they had expended.
The conferences at Utrecht were interrupted by a quarrel
between the dome&s;ticks of Menager, and tho&s;e of the
Count de Rechteren, one of the Dutch plenipotentiaries.
The populace in&s;ulted the Earl of Strafford and the Mar|quis
del Borgo, mini&s;ter of Savoy, who&s;e ma&s;ter was re|ported
to have agreed to the armi&s;tice. The&s;e ob&s;tructions
being removed, the conferences were renewed, and the
Briti&s;h plenipotentiaries exerted all their rhetorick, both in
public and private, to engage the allies in the Queen's
mea&s;ures. At length the Duke of Savoy was prevailed
upon to acquie&s;ce in the offers of France. Mr. Thomas
Harley had been &s;ent amba&s;&s;ador to Hanover, with a view
to per&s;uade the Elector that it would be for his intere&s;t to
co-operate with her Maje&s;ty; but that prince's re&s;olution
was already taken. &startq;Whenever it &s;hall plea&s;e God
(&s;aid he) to call me to the throne of Britain, I hope to
act as becomes me for the advantage of my people: in
the mean time, &s;peak to me as to a German prince, and
a prince of the empire.&endq; Nor was &s;he more &s;ucce&s;sful
in her endeavours to bring over the King of Pru&s;&s;ia to her
&s;entiments. In the mean time, Lord Lexington was ap|pointed
amba&s;&s;ador to Madrid, where King Philip &s;olemnly
&s;wore to ob&s;erve the renunciation, which was approved
and confirmed by the Cortez. The like renunciation to
the crown of Spain was afterwards made by the princes of
France; and Philip was declared incapable of &s;ucceeding
to the crown of that realm. The court of Portugal held
out again&s;t the remon&s;trances of England, until the Mar|quis
de Bay invaded that kingdom at the head of twenty
thou&s;and men, and undertook the &s;iege of Campo-Major,
and they &s;ound they had no longer any hope of being
a&s;&s;i&s;ted by his Britannick Maje&s;ty. The Portugue&s;e mi|ni&s;ter
at Utrecht &s;igned the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms on the
&s;eventh day of November, and excu&s;ed this &s;tep to the
allies, as the pure effect of nece&s;&s;ity. The Engli&s;h troops
in Spain were ordered to &s;eparate from the army of Count
<PB N="235" REF="241">
Staremberg, and march to the neighbourhood of Barce|lona,
where they were embarked on board an Engli&s;h &s;qua|dron,
commanded by Sir John Jennings, and tran&s;ported to
Minorca.</P>
<P>&sect; XIX. The campaign being at an end in the Nether|lands,
the Duke of Ormond returned to England, where
the party-di&s;putes were become more violent than ever.
The Whigs affected to celebrate the anniver&s;ary of the
late King's birth-day, in London, with extraordinary re|joicings.
Mobs were hired by both factions; and the
whole city was filled with riot and uproar. A ridiculous
&s;cheme was contrived to frighten the Lord-Trea&s;urer
with &s;ome &s;quibs in a band-box, which the mini&s;ters
magnified into a con&s;piracy. The Duke of Hamilton
having been appointed amba&s;&s;ador extraordinary to the
court of France, the Whigs were alarmed, on the &s;uppo|&s;ition
that this nobleman favoured the Pretender. Some
di&s;pute ari&s;ing between the Duke and Lord Mohun, on the
&s;ubject of a law-&s;uit, furni&s;hed a pretence for a quarrel.
Mohun, who had been twice tried for murther, and was
counted a mean tool, as well as the Hector of the Whig
party, &s;ent a me&s;&s;age by General Macartney to the Duke,
challenging him to &s;ingle combat. The principals met
by appointment in Hyde-Park, attended by Macartney and
Colonel Hamilton. They fought with &s;uch fury, that
Mohun was killed upon the &s;pot, and the Duke expired
before he could be conveyed to his own hou&s;e. Macart|ney
di&s;appeared, and e&s;caped in di&s;gui&s;e to the continent.
Colonel Hamilton declared upon oath before the privy-council,
that when the principals engaged, he and Ma|cartney
followed their example; that Macartney was im|mediately
di&s;armed; but the Colonel &s;eeing the Duke fall
upon his antagoni&s;t, threw away the &s;words, and ran to
lift him up; that while he was employed in rai&s;ing the
Duke, Macartney, having taken up one of the &s;words,
&s;tabbed his grace over Hamilton's &s;houlder, and retired
immediately. A proclamation was i&s;&s;ued, promi&s;ing a
reward of five hundred pounds to tho&s;e who &s;hould
<PB N="236" REF="242">
apprehend or di&s;cover Macartney, and the Duche&s;s of Ha|milton
offered three hundred pounds for the &s;ame purpo&s;e.
The Tories exclaimed again&s;t this event as a party duel:
they treated Macartney as a cowardly a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in; and af|firmed
that Whigs had po&s;ted others of the &s;ame &s;tamp
all round Hyde-Park, to murther the Duke of Hamilton,
in ca&s;e he had triumphed over his antagoni&s;t, and e&s;caped
the treachery of Macartney. The Whigs, on the other
hand, affirmed, that it was altogether a private quarrel:
that Macartney was entirely innocent of the per&s;idy laid
to his charge: that he afterwards &s;ubmitted to a fair
trial, at which Colonel Hamilton prevaricated in giving
his evidence, and was contradicted by the te&s;timony of
divers per&s;ons who &s;aw the combat at a di&s;tance. The
Duke of Marlborough, hearing him&s;elf accu&s;ed as the au|thor
of tho&s;e party mi&s;chiefs, and &s;eeing his enemies grow
every day more and more implacable, thought proper to
retire to the continent, where he was followed by his du|che&s;s.
His friend Godolphin had died in September, with
the general character of an able, cool, di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate mini|&s;ter,
who had rendered him&s;elf nece&s;&s;ary to four &s;ucce&s;|&s;ive
&s;overeigns, and managed the finances with equal &s;kill
and integrity. The Duke of Shrew&s;bury was nominated
amba&s;&s;ador to France, in the room of the Duke of Hamil|ton:
the Duke d'Aumount arrived at London in the
&s;ame quality from the court of Ver&s;ailles; and about the
&s;ame time the Queen granted an audience to the Marquis
de Montelcone, whom Philip had appointed one of his
plenipotentiaries at the congre&s;s.</P>
<P>&sect; XX. In vain had the Briti&s;h mini&s;ters in Holland
endeavoured to overcome the ob&s;tinacy of the States-Ge|neral,
by alternate threats, promi&s;es, and arguments. In
vain did they repre&s;ent, that the confederacy again&s;t
France could be no longer &s;upported with any pro&s;pect of
&s;ucce&s;s: that the Queen's aim had been to procure rea|&s;onable
terms for her allies; but that their oppo&s;ition to
her mea&s;ures prevented her from obtaining &s;uch conditi|ons
as &s;he would have a right to demand in their favour,
<PB N="237" REF="243">
were they unanimous in their con&s;ultations. In Novem|ber,
the Earl of Strafford pre&s;ented a new plan of peace,
in which the Queen promi&s;ed to in&s;i&s;t upon France's
ceding to the States the city of Tournay, and &s;ome other
places which they could not expect to po&s;&s;e&s;s, &s;hould
&s;he conclude a &s;eparate treaty. They now began to wa|ver
in their councils. The fir&s;t tran&s;ports of their re|&s;entment
having &s;ub&s;ided, they plainly perceived that the
continuation of the war would entail upon them a bur|then
which they could not bear, e&s;pecially &s;ince the Duke
of Savoy and the King of Portugal had de&s;erted the alli|ance:
be&s;ides, they were &s;taggered by the affair of the
new barrier, &s;o much more advantageous than that which
France had propo&s;ed in the beginning of the conferences.
They were influenced by another motive: namely, the
apprehen&s;ion of new mi&s;chiefs to the empire from the
King of Sweden, who&s;e affairs &s;eemed to take a favourable
turn at the Ottoman Porte, through the interce&s;&s;ion of
the French monarch. The Czar and King Augu&s;tus
had penetrated into Pomerania: the King of Denmark had
taken Staden, reduced Bremen, and laid Hamburgh under
contribution; but Count Steenbock, the Swedi&s;h general,
defeated the Dani&s;h army in Mecklenbourg, ravaged Hol|&s;tein
with great barbarity, and reduced the town of Al|tena
to a&s;hes. The Grand Signor threatened to declare
war again&s;t the Czar, or pretence that he had not per|formed
&s;ome e&s;&s;ential articles of the late peace: but his
real motive was an inclination to &s;upport the King of
Sweden. This di&s;po&s;ition, however, was defeated by a
powerful party at the Porte, who were aver&s;e to war-Charles,
who &s;till remained at Bender, was de&s;ired to re|turn
to his own kingdom, and given to under&s;tand, that
the Sultan would procure him a &s;afe pa&s;&s;age. He treated
the per&s;on who brought this intimation with the mo&s;t
outrageous in&s;olence; rejected the propo&s;al; fortified his
hou&s;e; and re&s;olved to defend him&s;elf to the la&s;t extre|mity.
Being attacked by a con&s;iderable body of Turki&s;h
forces, he and his attendants &s;ought with the mo&s;t frantick
<PB N="238" REF="244">
valour. They flew &s;ome hundreds of the a&s;&s;ailants; but at
la&s;t the Turks &s;et fire to the hou&s;e: &s;o that he was obliged
to &s;urrender him&s;elf and his followers, who were generally
&s;old for &s;laves. He him&s;elf was conveyed under a &s;trong
guard to Adrianople. Mean while the Czar landed with an
army in Finland, which he totally reduced. Steenbock
maintained him&s;elf in Tonningen until all his &s;upplies
were cut off; and then he was obliged to deliver him&s;elf
and his troops pri&s;oners of war. But this rever&s;e was not
fore&s;een when the Dutch dreaded a rupture between the
Porte and the Mu&s;covites, and were given to under&s;tand
that the Turks would revive the troubles in Hungary. In
that ca&s;e, they knew the Emperor would recall great part
of his troops from the Netherlands, where the burthen of
the war mu&s;t lie upon their &s;houlders. After various con|&s;ultations
in their different a&s;&s;emblies, they came into the
Queen's mea&s;ures, and &s;igned the barrier treaty.</P>
<P>&sect; XXI. Then the plenipotentiaries of the four a&s;&s;o|ciated
circles pre&s;ented a remon&s;trance to the Briti&s;h mi|ni&s;ters
at Utrecht, imploring the Queen's interpo&s;ition in
their favour, that they might not be left in the mi&s;erable
condition to which they had been reduced by former
treaties. They were given to under&s;tand, that if they
&s;hould not obtain what they de&s;ired, they them&s;elves
would be ju&s;tly blamed as the authors of their own di&s;|appointment:
that they had been deficient in furni&s;hing
their proportion of troops and other nece&s;&s;aries; and left
the whole burthen of the war to fall upon the Queen and
the States in the Netherlands: that when a ce&s;&s;ation was
judged nece&s;&s;ary, they had de&s;erted her Maje&s;ty to follow
the chimerical projects of Prince Eugene: that while &s;he
pro&s;ecuted the war with the utmo&s;t vigour, they had acted
with coldne&s;s and indifference; but when &s;he inclined to
peace they began to exert them&s;elves in pro&s;ecuting ho|&s;tilities
with uncommon eagerne&s;s: that, neverthele&s;s,
&s;he would not abandon their intere&s;ts, but endeavour to
procure for them as good conditions as their prepo&s;terous
conduct would allow her to demand. Even the Emperor's
<PB N="239" REF="245">
plenipotentiaries began to talk in more moderate terms.
Zinzendorf declared that his ma&s;ter was very well di&s;|po&s;ed
to promote a general peace; and no longer in&s;i&s;ted
on a ce&s;&s;ion of the Spani&s;h monarchy to the Hou&s;e of
Au&s;tria. Philip's mini&s;ters, together with tho&s;e of Bava|ria
and Cologn, were admitted to the congre&s;s; and now
the plenipotentiaries of Britain acted as mediators for the
re&s;t of the allies.</P>
<P>&sect; XXII. The pacification between France and England
was retarded, however, by &s;ome unfore&s;een difficulties that
aro&s;e in adju&s;ting the commerce and the limits of the
countries po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by both nations in North-America. A
long di&s;pute en&s;ued; and the Duke of Shrew&s;bury and
Prior held many conferences with the French mini&s;try: at
length it was compromi&s;ed, though not much to the ad|vantage
of Great-Britain; and the Engli&s;h plenipoten|tiaries
received an order to &s;ign a &s;eparate treaty. They
declared to the mini&s;ters of the other powers, that they
and &s;ome other plenipotentiaries were ready to &s;ign their
re&s;pective treaties on the eleventh day of April. Count Zin|zendorf
endeavoured to po&s;tpone this tran&s;action until he
&s;hould be furni&s;hed with fre&s;h in&s;tructions from Vienna;
and even threatened that if the States &s;hould &s;ign the
peace contrary to his de&s;ire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$.</NOTE> the Emperor would imme|diately
withdraw his troops from the Netherlands.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Boyer.</NOTE> The

that his Imperial Maje&s;ty &s;hould have time to con&s;ider whe|ther

would they agree to a ce&s;&s;ation of arms during that interval.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rou&s;&s;et.</NOTE>

of the French King for making peace with the
Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria and the empire.&endq; The Count and
the mini&s;ters of the German princes exclaimed again&s;t
<PB N="240" REF="246">
the in&s;olence of France, which had not even be&s;towed the
title of Emperor on Jo&s;eph; but wanted to impo&s;e terms
upon them with relation to the Electors of Cologn and
Bavaria.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIII.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1713.</NOTE> The treaties of peace and commerce between
England and France being ratified by the Queen of Eng|land,
the parliament was a&s;&s;embled on the ninth day of April,
The Queen told them the treaty was &s;igned, and that in
a few days the ratifications would be exchanged. She
&s;aid, what &s;he had done for the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and
the perfect friend&s;hip &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between her and the hou&s;e
of Hanover, would convince tho&s;e who wi&s;hed well to both,
and de&s;ired the quiet and &s;afety of their country, how
vain all attempts were to divide them. She left it entirely
to the Hou&s;e of Commons to determine what force might
be nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ecurity of trade by &s;ea, and for guards
and garri&s;ons. &startq;Make your&s;elves &s;afe (&s;aid &s;he) and I
&s;hall be &s;atisfied. Next to the protection of the divine
providence, I depend upon the loyalty and affection of
my people. I want no other guarantee.&endq; She recom|mended
to their protection tho&s;e brave men who had ex|po&s;ed
their lives in the &s;ervice of their country, and could
not be employed in time of peace. She de&s;ired they would
concert proper mea&s;ures for ea&s;ing the foreign trade of the
kingdom, for improving and encouraging manufactures
and the fi&s;hery: and for employing the hands of idle
people. She expre&s;&s;ed her di&s;plea&s;ure at the &s;candalous
and &s;editious libels which had been lately publi&s;hed. She
exhorted them to con&s;ider of new laws to prevent this li|centiou&s;ne&s;s,
as well as for putting a &s;top to the impious
practice of duelling. She conjured them to u&s;e their ut|mo&s;t
endeavours to calm the minds of men at home, that
the arts of peace might be cultivated; and that ground|le&s;s
jealou&s;ies contrived by a faction, and fomented by
party-rage, might not e&s;&s;ect that which their foreign ene|mies
could not accompli&s;h. This was the language of a
pious, candid, and benevolent &s;overeign, who loved her
<PB N="241" REF="247">
&s;ubjects with a truly parental affection.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. X1. 1713.</NOTE> The parliament
con&s;idered her in that light. Each Hou&s;e pre&s;ented her
with a warm address of thanks and congratulation, ex|pre&s;&s;ing,
in particular, their inviolable attachment to the
prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the illu&s;trious hou&s;e of Hanover.
The ratifications of the treaty being exchanged, the peace
was proclaimed on the fifth of May, with the u&s;ual cere|monies,
to the inexpre&s;&s;ible joy of the nation in general:
it was about this period that the Chevalier de St. George
conveyed a printed remon&s;trance to the mini&s;ters at Utrecht,
&s;olemnly prote&s;ting again&s;t all that might be &s;tipulated to
his prejudice. The Commons, in a &s;econd addre&s;s, had
be&s;ought her Maje&s;ty to communicate to the Hou&s;e in due
time the treaties of peace and commerce with France; and
now they were produced by Mr. Ben&s;on, Chancellor of the
Exchequer.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIV. By the treaty of peace the French King obli|ged
him&s;elf to abandon the Pretender, and acknowledge
the Queen's title and the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; to raze
the fortifications of Dunkirk within a limited time, on
condition of receiving an equivalent; to cede Newfound|land,
Hud&s;on's-Bay, and St. Chri&s;topher's to England;
but, the French were left in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Cape Breton,
and at liberty to dry their fi&s;h on Newfoundland. By the
treaty of commerce a free trade was e&s;tabli&s;hed, according
to the tariff of the year one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and &s;ixty|four,
except in &s;ome commodities that were &s;ubjected to new
regulations in the year &s;ixteen hundred and ninety-nine.
It was agreed, That no other duties &s;hould be impo&s;ed on
the productions of France imported into England than
tho&s;e that were laid on the &s;ame commodities from other
countries; and, That commi&s;&s;aries &s;hould meet at Lon|don,
to adju&s;t all matters relating to commerce: as for
the tariff with Spain, it was not yet fini&s;hed. It was
&s;tipulated, That the Emperor &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s the kingdom
of Naples, the duchy of Milan, and the Spani&s;h Nether|lands:
That the Duke of Savoy &s;hould enjoy Sicily, with
the title of king: That the &s;ame title, with the i&s;land of
<PB N="242" REF="248">
Sardinia, &s;hould be allotted to the Elector of Bavaria,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK 1. 1713.</NOTE> as
an indemnification for his lo&s;&s;es: That the States-General
&s;hould re&s;tore Li&s;le and its dependencies: That Namur,
Charleroy, Luxembourg, Ypres, and Newport &s;hould be
added to the other places they already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in Flan|ders;
and That the King of Pru&s;&s;ia &s;hould have Upper-Gueldre,
in lieu of Orange and the other e&s;tates belong|ing
to that family in Franche Comt&eacute;. The King of
Portugal was &s;atisfied; and the fir&s;t day of June was fixed
as the period of time granted to the Emperor for con&s;ide|ration.</P>
<P>&sect; XXV. A day being appointed by the Commons to
deliberate upon the treaty of commerce, very ju&s;t and
weighty objections were made to the eighth and ninth arti|cles,
importing, That Great-Britain and France &s;hould
mutually enjoy all the privileges in trading with each
other that either granted to the mo&s;t favoured nation;
and that no higher cu&s;toms &s;hould be exacted from the
commodities of France, than tho&s;e that were drawn from
the &s;ame productions of any other people. The balance of
trade having long inclined to the &s;ide of France, &s;evere
duties had been laid on all the productions and manu|factures
of that kingdom, &s;o as almo&s;t to amount to a
total prohibition. Some members ob&s;erved, that, by the
treaty between England and Portugal, the duties charged
upon the wines of that country were lower than tho&s;e
laid upon the wines of France: that &s;hould they now be
reduced to an equality, the difference of freight was &s;o
great, that the French wines would be found much cheap|er
than tho&s;e of Portugal; and, as they were more agree|able
to the ta&s;te of the nation in general, there would be
no market for the Portugue&s;e wines in England: that
&s;hould this be the ca&s;e, the Engli&s;h would lo&s;e their trade
with Portugal, the mo&s;t advantageous of any traffick which
they now carried on: for it con&s;umed a great quantity of
their manufactures, and returned a yearly &s;um of &s;ix hun|dred
thou&s;and pounds in gold. Mr. Nathaniel Gould,
formerly governor of the Bank, affirmed, that a France
<PB N="243" REF="249">
had, &s;ince the Revolution, encouraged woolen manufactures,
and prepared at home &s;everal commodities which formerly
they drew from England; &s;o the Engli&s;h had learned to
make &s;ilk &s;tuffs, paper, and all manner of toys formerly
imported from France: by which means, an infinite
number of artificers was employed, and a va&s;t &s;um annually
&s;aved to the nation: but the&s;e people would now be re|duced
to beggary, and that money lo&s;t again to the king|dom,
&s;hould French commodities of the &s;ame kind be im|ported
under ordinary duties, becau&s;e labour was much
cheaper in France than in England, con&s;equently the
Briti&s;h manufactures would be under&s;old and ruined. He
urged, that the ruin of the &s;ilk manufacture would be at|tended
with another di&s;advantage. Great quantities of
woolen cloths were vended in Italy and Turkey, in con|&s;equence
of the raw &s;ilk which the Engli&s;h merchants
bought up in tho&s;e countries; and, &s;hould the &s;ilk manu|facture
at home be lo&s;t, tho&s;e markets for Briti&s;h commo|dities
would fail of cour&s;e. Others alledged, that if the
articles of commerce had been &s;ettled before the Engli&s;h
troops &s;eparated from tho&s;e of the confederates, the French
King would not have pre&s;umed to in&s;i&s;t upon &s;uch terms,
but have been glad to comply with more moderate con|ditions.
Sir William Wyndham reflected on the late mini|&s;try,
for having neglected to make an advantageous peace
when it was in their power. He &s;aid that Portugal would
always have occa&s;ion for the woolen manufactures and
the corn of England, and be obliged to buy them at all
events. After a violent debate, the Hou&s;e re&s;olved, by a
great majority, That a bill &s;hould be brought in to make
good the eighth and ninth articles of the treaty of com|merce
with France. Again&s;t the&s;e articles, however, the
Portugue&s;e mini&s;ter pre&s;ented a memorial, declaring, that
&s;hould the duties on French wines be lowered to the &s;ame
level with tho&s;e that were laid on the wines of Portugal,
his ma&s;ter would renew the prohibition of the woolen
manufactures, and other products of Great-Britain. In|deed,
all the trading part of the nation exclaimed again&s;t
<PB N="244" REF="250">
the treaty of commerce, which &s;eems to have been con|cluded
in a hurry, before the mini&s;ters fully under&s;tood
the nature of the &s;ubject. This precipitation was owing to
the fears that their endeavours after peace would mi&s;carry,
from the intrigues of the Whig faction, and the ob&s;tinate
oppo&s;ition of the confederates.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVI. The Commons having granted an aid of two
&s;hillings in the pound, proceeded to renew the duty on
malt for another year, and extended this tax to the whole
i&s;land, notwith&s;tanding the warm remon&s;trances of the
Scotti&s;h members, who repre&s;ented it as a burthen which
their country could not bear. They in&s;i&s;ted upon an ex|pre&s;s
article of the Union, &s;tipulating, That no duty
&s;hould be laid on the malt in Scotland during the war,
which they affirmed was not yet fini&s;hed, inasmuch as the
peace with Spain had not been proclaimed. During the
adjournment of the parliament, on account of the Whit&s;un
holidays, the Scots of both Hou&s;es, laying a&s;ide all party-di&s;tinctions,
met and deliberated on this &s;ubject. They
deputed the Duke of Argyle, the Earl of Mar, Mr.
Lockhart, and Mr. Cockburn, to lay their grievances
before the Queen. They repre&s;ented, that their country|men
bore with impatience the violation of &s;ome articles
of the Union; and that the impo&s;ition of &s;uch an in&s;up|portable
burthen as the malt-tax would in all probability
prompt them to declare the Union di&s;&s;olved. The Queen,
alarmed at this remon&s;trance, an&s;wered, that &s;he wi&s;hed
they might not have cau&s;e to repent of &s;uch a precipitate
re&s;olution; but &s;he would endeavour to make all things
ea&s;y. On the fir&s;t day of June, the Earl of Findlater, in
the Hou&s;e of Peers, repre&s;ented that the Scotti&s;h nation
was aggrieved in many in&s;tances; that they were deprived
of a privy-council, and &s;ubjected to the Engli&s;h laws in ca&s;es
of trea&s;on; that their nobles were rendered incapable
of being created Briti&s;h peers; and that now they were
oppre&s;&s;ed with the in&s;upportable burthen of a malt-tax,
when they had rea&s;on to expect they &s;hould reap the bene|fits
of peace; he, therefore, moved, that leave might be
<PB N="245" REF="251">
given to bring in a bill for di&s;&s;olving the Union, and &s;e|curing
the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the hou&s;e of Hanover.
Lord North and Grey affirmed, that the complaints of
the Scots were groundle&s;s; that the di&s;&s;olution of the
Union was impracticable; and he made &s;ome &s;arca&s;tick re|flexions
on the poverty of that nation. He was an&s;wered
by the Earl of Eglington, who admitted the Scots were poor,
and therefore unable to pay the malt-tax. The Earl of
Ilay, among other pertinent remarks upon the Union, ob|&s;erved,
that when the treaty was made, the Scots took it
for granted that the parliament of Great-Britain would
never load them with any impo&s;ition that they had rea&s;on
to believe grievous. The Earl of Peterborough compared
the Union to a marriage. He &s;aid, that though England,
who mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed the hu&s;band, might in &s;ome in&s;tances
prove unkind to the lady, &s;he ought not immediately to &s;ue
for a divorce, the rather becau&s;e &s;he had very much mended
her fortune by the match. Ilay replied, that marriage was an
ordinance of God; and the Union no more than a political
expedient. The other affirmed, that the contract could
not have been more &s;olemn, unle&s;s, like the ten com|mandments,
it had come from heaven: he inveighed
again&s;t the Scots, as a people that would never be &s;atisfied;
that would have all the advantages re&s;ulting from the Union,
but would pay nothing by their good will, although they
had received more money from England than the amount
of all their e&s;tates. To the&s;e animadver&s;ions the Duke of
Argyle made a very warm reply. &startq;I have been reflected
on by &s;ome people (&s;aid he) as if I was di&s;gu&s;ted, and had
changed &s;ides; but I de&s;pi&s;e their per&s;ons, as much as
I undervalue their judgement.&endq; He urged, that the malt-tax
in Scotland was like taxing land by the acre through|out
England, becau&s;e land was worth five pounds an acre
$n the neighbourhood of London, and would not fetch &s;o
many &s;hillings in the remote counties. In like manner,
$he Engli&s;h malt was valued at four times the price of that
which was made in Scotland; therefore, the tax in this
$ountry mu&s;t be levied by a regiment of dragoons. He
<PB N="246" REF="252">
owned he had a great &s;hare in making the Union, with a
view to &s;ecure the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; but he was now
&s;atisfied this end might be an&s;wered as effectually if the
Union was di&s;&s;olved; and, if this &s;tep &s;hould not be taken,
he did not expect long to have either property left in Scot|land,
or liberty in England. All the Whig members
voted for the di&s;&s;olution of that treaty which they had &s;o
eagerly promoted; while the Tories &s;trenuou&s;ly &s;upported
the mea&s;ure again&s;t which they had once argued with
&s;uch vehemence. In the cour&s;e of the debate, the Lord-Trea&s;urer
ob&s;erved, that although the malt-tax were im|po&s;ed,
it might be afterwards remitted by the crown.
The Earl of Sunderland expre&s;&s;ed &s;urpri&s;e at hearing that
noble lord broach a doctrine which tended to e&s;tabli&s;h a
de&s;potick di&s;pen&s;ing power, and arbitrary government. Ox|ford
replied, his family had never been famous, as &s;ome
others had been, for promoting and advi&s;ing arbitrary mea|&s;ures.
Sunderland, con&s;idering this expre&s;&s;ion as a &s;ar|ca&s;m
levelled at the memory of his father, took occa&s;ion
to vindicate his conduct; adding, that in tho&s;e days the
other lord's family was hardly known. Much violent alter|cation
was di&s;charged. At length the motion for the bill
was rejected by a &s;mall majority, and the malt-bill after|wards
pa&s;&s;ed with great difficulty.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVII. Another bill being brought into the Hou&s;e
of Commons, for rendering the treaty of commerce ef|fectual,
&s;uch a number of petitions were delivered again&s;t
it, and &s;o many &s;olid arguments advanced by the merchants
who were examined on the &s;ubject, that even a great num|ber
of Tory members were convinced of the bad con&s;e|quence
it would produce to trade, and voted again&s;t the
mini&s;try on this occa&s;ion; &s;o that the bill was rejected by
a majority of nine voices. At the &s;ame time, however,
the Hou&s;e agreed to an addre&s;s, thanking her Maje&s;ty for
the great care &s;he had taken of the &s;ecurity and honour o$
her kingdoms in the treaty of peace; as al&s;o for having
laid &s;o good a foundation for the intere&s;t of her people in
trade. They likewi&s;e be&s;ought her to appoint commi&s;|&s;ioners
<PB N="247" REF="253">
to treat with tho&s;e of France, for adju&s;ting &s;uch
matters as &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;ettled on the &s;ubject
of commerce, that the treaty might be explained and per|fected
for the good and welfare of her people. The Queen
interpreted this addre&s;s into a full approbation of the trea|ties
of peace and commerce, and thanked them accordingly
in the warme&s;t terms of &s;atisfaction and acknowledgement.
The Commons afterwards de&s;ired to know what equivalent
&s;hould be given for the demolition of Dunkirk; and &s;he
gave them to under&s;tand, that this was already in the
hands of his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty: then they be&s;ought
her that &s;he would not evacuate the towns of Flanders
that were in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, until tho&s;e who were entitled
to the &s;overeignty of the Spani&s;h Netherlands &s;hould agree
to &s;uch articles for regulating trade as might place the
&s;ubjects of Great-Britain upon an equal footing with tho&s;e
of any other nation. The Queen made a favourable an|&s;wer
to all their remon&s;trances. Such were the &s;teps
taken by the parliament during this &s;e&s;&s;ion with relation
to the famous treaty of Utrecht, again&s;t which the Whigs
exclaimed &s;o violently, that many well-meaning people
believed it would be attended with the immediate ruin of
the kingdom: yet, under the &s;hadow of this very treaty,
Great-Britain enjoyed a long term of peace and tran|quillity.
Bi&s;hop Burnet was heated with an enthu&s;ia&s;tick
terrour of the Hou&s;e of Bourbon. He declared to the Queen
in private, that any treaty by which Spain and the We&s;t-Indies
were left in the hands of King Philip mu&s;t in a
little time deliver all Europe into the hands of France:
that if any &s;uch peace was made, the Queen was betrayed,
and her people ruined: that in le&s;s than three years &s;he
would be murthered, and the fires would blaze again in
Smithfield. This prelate lived to &s;ee his progno&s;tick di&s;|appointed;
therefore, he might have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed this anec|dote
of his own conduct.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVIII. On the twenty-fifth day of June, the
Queen &s;ignified, in a me&s;&s;age to the Hou&s;e of Commons,
that her civil li&s;t was burthened with &s;ome debts incurred
<PB N="248" REF="254">
by &s;everal articles of extraordinary expen&s;e; and that &s;he
hoped they would empower her to rai&s;e &s;uch a &s;um of
money upon the funds for that provi&s;ion, as would be
&s;ufficient to di&s;charge the incumberances, which amounted
to five hundred thou&s;and pounds. A bill was immediately
prepared for rai&s;ing this &s;um on the civil-li&s;t revenue, and
pa&s;&s;ed through both Hou&s;es with &s;ome difficulty. Both
Lords and Commons addre&s;&s;ed the Queen concerning the
Chevalier de St. George, who had repaired to Lorraine.
They de&s;ired &s;he would pre&s;s the Duke of that name, and
all the princes and &s;tates in amity with her, to exclude from
their dominions the pretender to the imperial crown of
Great-Britain. A publick thank&s;giving for the peace
was appointed and celebrated with great &s;olemnity; and
on the &s;ixteenth day of July the Queen clo&s;ed the &s;e&s;&s;ion
with a &s;peech which was not at all agreeable to the violent
Whigs, becau&s;e it did not contain one word about the Pre|tender
and the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. From the&s;e omi&s;&s;ions
they concluded, that the dictates of natural affection had bi|a&s;&s;ed
her in favour of the Chevalier de St. George. What|ever
&s;entiments of tenderne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion &s;he might
feel for that unfortunate exile, the acknowledged &s;on of
her own father, it does not appear that &s;he ever entertained
a thought of altering the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed.
The term of Sacheverel's &s;u&s;pen&s;ion being expired, extra|ordinary
rejoicing were made upon the occa&s;ion. He
was de&s;ired to preach before the Hou&s;e of Commons, who
thanked him for his &s;ermon; and the Queen promoted
him to the rich benefice of St. Andrew's, Holbourn. On
the other hand, the Duke d'Aumount, amba&s;&s;ador from
France, was in&s;ulted by the populace. Scurrilous ballad$
were publi&s;hed again&s;t him both in the Engli&s;h and French
languages. He received divers anonymous letters, con|taining
threats of &s;etting fire to his hou&s;e, which was ac|cordingly
burned to the ground, though whether by acci|dent
or de&s;ign he could not well determine. The ma|gi&s;tracy
of Dunkirk, having &s;ent a deputation with an
addre&s;s to the Queen, humbly imploring her Maje&s;ty to
<PB N="249" REF="255">
&s;pare the port and harbour of that town, and repre&s;enting
that they might be u&s;eful to her own &s;ubjects, the memorial
was printed and di&s;per&s;ed, and the arguments it contained
were an&s;wered and refuted by Addi&s;on, Steele, and Mayn|waring.
Commi&s;&s;ioners were &s;ent to &s;ee the fortifications
of Dunkirk demoli&s;hed. They were accordingly razed to
the ground; the harbour was filled up; and the Duke
d'Aumont returned to Paris in the month of November.
The Queen, by her remon&s;trances to the court of Ver|&s;ailles,
had procured the enlargement of one hundred and
thirty-&s;ix prote&s;tants from the gallies: under&s;tanding af|terwards
that as many more were detained on the &s;ame
account, &s;he made &s;uch application to the French mini&s;try,
that they too were relea&s;ed. Then &s;he appointed General
Ro&s;s her envoy extraordinary to the King of France.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIX. The Duke of Shrew&s;bury being nominated
lord-lieutenant of Ireland, a&s;&s;embled the parliament of that
kingdom on the twenty-fifth day of November, and found
the two Hou&s;es &s;till at variance, on the oppo&s;ite principles
of Whig and Tory. Allen Broderick being cho&s;en
&s;peaker of the Commons, they ordered a bill to be brought
in, to attaint the Pretender and all his adherents. They
pro&s;ecuted Edward Lloyd, for publi&s;hing a book intituled,
&startq;Memoirs of the Chevalier de St. George;&endq; and they
agreed upon an addre&s;s to the Queen, to remove from the
chancellor&s;hip Sir Con&s;tantine Phipps, who had counte|nanced
the Tories of that kingdom. The Lords, how|ever,
re&s;olved, that Chancellor Phipps had, in his &s;everal
&s;tations, acquitted him&s;elf with honour and integrity.
The two Hou&s;es of Convocation pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to
the &s;ame purpo&s;e. They likewi&s;e complained of Mr.
Mole&s;worth, for having in&s;ulted them, by &s;aying, when
they appeared in the ca&s;tle of Dublin, &startq;They that have
turned the world up&s;ide-down are come hither al&s;o;&endq;
and he was removed from the privy-council. The Duke
of Shrew&s;bury received orders to prorogue this parliament,
which was divided again&s;t it&s;elf, and portended nothing
but dome&s;tick broils. Then he obtained leave to return
<PB N="250" REF="256">
to England, leaving Chancellor Phipps, with the Arch|bi&s;hops
of Armagh and Tuam, ju&s;tices of the kingdom.</P>
<P>&sect; XXX. The parliament of England had been di&s;|&s;olved;
and the elections were managed in &s;uch a man|ner
as to retain the legi&s;lative power in the hands of the
Tories: but the meeting of the new parliament was de|layed
by repeated prorogations to the tenth day of Decem|ber;
a delay partly owing to the Queen's indi&s;po&s;ition;
and partly to the conte&s;ts among her mini&s;ters. Oxford
and Bolingbroke were competitors for power, and rivals in
reputation for ability. The Trea&s;urer's parts were
deemed the more &s;olid; the Secretary's more &s;hining: but
both mini&s;ters were a&s;piring and ambitious. The fir&s;t
was bent upon maintaining the fir&s;t rank in the admini|&s;tration,
which he had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ince the revolution in the
mini&s;try: the other di&s;dained to act as a &s;ubaltern to the
man whom he thought he excelled in genius, and equalled
in importance. They began to form &s;eparate cabals, and
adopt different principles. Bolingbroke in&s;inuated him&s;elf
into the confidence of Lady Ma&s;ham, to whom Oxford
had given &s;ome cau&s;e of di&s;gu&s;t. By this communication
he gained ground in the good opinion of his &s;overeign,
while the Trea&s;urer lo&s;t it in the &s;ame proportion. Thus
&s;he who had been the author of his elevation was now
u&s;ed as the in&s;trument of his di&s;grace. The Queen was
&s;en&s;ibly affected with the&s;e diffentions, which &s;he inter|po&s;ed
her advice and authority, by turns, to appea&s;e: but
their mutual animo&s;ity continued to rankle under an en|terior
accommodation. The intere&s;t of Bolingbroke was
powerfully &s;upported by Sir Simon Harcourt, the chan|cellor,
Sir William Wyndham, and Mr. Secretary Brom|ley.
Oxford perceived his own influence was on the
wane, and began to think of retirement. Mean while,
the Earl of Peterborough was appointed amba&s;&s;ador to the
King of Sicily; and &s;et out for Turin. The Queen
retired to Wind&s;or, where &s;he was &s;ei&s;ed with a very dan|gerous
inflammatory fever. The hopes of the Jacobites
vi&s;ibly ro&s;e: the publick funds immediately &s;ell: a great
<PB N="251" REF="257">
run was made upon the Bank, the directors of which were
overwhelmed with con&s;ternation, which was not a little
increa&s;ed by the report of an armament equipped in the
ports of France. They &s;ent one of their members to re|pre&s;ent
to the Trea&s;ure the danger that threatened the
publick credit. The Queen, being made acquainted with
the&s;e occurrences, &s;igned a letter to Sir Samuel Stancer,
lord-mayor of London, declaring, that now &s;he was re|covered
of her late indi&s;po&s;ition &s;he would return to the
place of her u&s;ual re&s;idence, and open the parliament on
the &s;ixteenth day of February. This intimation &s;he &s;ent
to her loving &s;ubjects of the city of London, to the intent
that all of them, in their &s;everal &s;tations, might di&s;coun|tenance
tho&s;e malicious rumours &s;pread by evil-minded
per&s;ons, to the prejudice of credit, and the imminent
hazard of the publick peace and tranquillity. The Queen's
recovery, together with certain intelligence that the ar|mament
was a phantom, and the Pretender &s;till in Lor|raine,
helped to a&s;&s;uage the ferment of the nation, which
had been indu&s;triou&s;ly rai&s;ed by party-writings. Mr. Ri|chard
Steele publi&s;hed a performance, intituled &startq;The
Cri&s;is,&endq; in defence of the Revolution and the prote&s;tant
e&s;tabli&s;hment, and enlarging upon the danger of a popi&s;h
&s;ucce&s;&s;or. On the other hand, the hereditary right of the
crown of England was a&s;&s;erted in a large volume, &s;up|po&s;ed
to be written with a view to pave the way for the
Pretender's acce&s;&s;ion. One Bedford was apprehended,
tried, convicted, and &s;everely puni&s;hed, as the publi&s;her of
this treati&s;e.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXI. While England was harra&s;&s;ed by the&s;e in|te&s;tine
commotions, the Emperor, rejecting the terms of
peace propo&s;ed by France, re&s;olved to maintain the war
at his own expen&s;e, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the empire. His
forces on the Rhine, commanded by Prince Eugene, were
&s;o much outnumbered by the French under Villars, that
they could not prevent the enemy from reducing the two
important fortre&s;&s;es of Landau and Friburg. His Im|perial
Maje&s;ty hoped that the death of Queen Anne, or
<PB N="252" REF="258">
that of Louis XIV. would produce an alteration in Europe
that might be favourable to his intere&s;t; and he depended
upon the conduct and fortune of Prince Eugene, for &s;ome
lucky event in war. But finding him&s;elf di&s;appointed in
all the&s;e expectations, and ab&s;olutely unable to &s;upport
the expen&s;e of another campaign, he hearkened to over|tures
of peace that were made by the Electors of Cologn
and Palatine; and conferences were opened at the ca&s;tle
of Al-Ra&s;tadt, between Prince Eugene and Mare&s;chal
de Villars, on the twenty-&s;ixth day of November. In the
beginning of February, the&s;e mini&s;ters &s;eparated, without
&s;eeming to have come to any conclu&s;ion; but all the ar|ticles
being &s;ettled between the two courts of Vienna and
Ver&s;ailles, they met again the latter end of the month:
the treaty was &s;igned on the third day of March; and or|ders
were &s;ent to the governors and commanders on both
&s;ides to de&s;i&s;t from all ho&s;tilities. By this treaty, the
French King yielded to the Emperor Old Bri&s;ac, with all
its dependencies, Friburg, the forts in the Bri&s;gau and
Black Fore&s;t, together with Fort Khel. He engaged to
demoli&s;h the fortifications oppo&s;ite to Huningen, the fort
of Sellingen, and all between that and Fort Louis. The
town and fortre&s;s of Landau were ceded to the King of
France, who acknowledged the Elector of Hanover. The
Electors of Bavaria and Cologn were re&s;tored to all their
dignities and dominions. The Emperor was put in im|mediate
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Spani&s;h Netherlands; and the
King of Pru&s;&s;ia was permitted to retain the high quarter
of Gueldres. Finally, the contracting parties agreed that a
congre&s;s &s;hould be opened on the fir&s;t of May, at Baden in
Switzerland, for terminating all differences; and Prince Eu|gene
and Mare&s;chal de Villars were appointed their fir&s;t
plenipotentiaries.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXII. The ratifications of the treaty between Great-Britain
and Spain being exchanged, the peace was pro|claimed
on the fir&s;t day of March, in London; and the
articles were not di&s;agreeable to the Engli&s;h nation. The
Kingdom$ of France and Spain were &s;eparated for ever.
<PB N="253" REF="259">
Philip acknowledged the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and re|nounced
the Pretender. He agreed to a renewal of the
treaty of navigation and commerce concluded in the year
one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and &s;ixty-&s;even. He granted an
exclu&s;ive privilege to the Engli&s;h for furni&s;hing the Spa|ni&s;h
We&s;t-Indies with negroes, according to the a&s;&s;iento
contract.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The a&s;&s;iento contract &s;tipulated that from the fir&s;t day of May, 1713, to the fir&s;t of May, 1743, the company &s;hould tran&s;port into the We&s;t-$word$ one hundred forty-four thou&s;and negroes, at the rate of four thou&s;and $word$ hundred negroes a year; and pay for each negro thirty-three pieces of $word$ and one third, in full for all royal duties.</NOTE> He ceded Gibraltar to England, as well as
the i&s;land of Minorca, on condition that the Spani&s;h in|habitants
&s;hould enjoy their e&s;tates and religion. He obli|ged
him&s;elf to grant a full pardon to the Catalonians, with
the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all their e&s;tates, honours, and privileges,
and to yield the kingdom of Sicily to the Duke of Savoy.
The new parliament was opened by commi&s;&s;ion in Febru|ary,
and Sir Thomas Hanmer was cho&s;en Speaker of the
Hou&s;e of Commons. On the &s;econd day of March, the
Queen being carried in a &s;edan to the Hou&s;e of Lords,
&s;ignified to both Hou&s;es, that &s;he had obtained an honour|able
and advantageous peace for her own people, and for
the greate&s;t part of her allies; and &s;he hoped her inter|po&s;ition
might prove effectual to complete the &s;ettlement
of Europe. She ob&s;erved, that &s;ome per&s;ons had been &s;o
malicious as to in&s;inuate that the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in
the hou&s;e of Hanover was in danger under her govern|ment;
but that tho&s;e who endeavoured to di&s;tract the
minds of men with imaginary dangers could only mean
to di&s;turb the public tranquillity. She &s;aid, that after
all &s;he had done to &s;ecure the religion and liberties of her
people, &s;he could not mention &s;uch proceedings without
&s;ome degree of warmth; and &s;he hoped her parliament
would agree with her, that attempts to weaken her autho|rity,
or to render the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the crown unea&s;y to her,
could never be proper means to &s;trengthen the prote&s;tant
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Affectionate addre&s;&s;es were pre&s;ented by the
Lords, the Commons, and the Convocation; but the ill
<PB N="254" REF="260">
humour of party &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, and was daily inflamed by
new pamphlets and papers. Steele, &s;upported by Addi&s;on
and Hallifax, appeared in the front of tho&s;e who drew their
pens in defence of Whig principles; and Swift was the
champion of the mini&s;try.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIII. The Earl of Wharton complained in the
Hou&s;e of Lords of a libel intituled, &startq;The publick &s;pirit
of the Whigs &s;et forth in their generous encourage|ment
of the author of the Cri&s;is.&endq; It was a &s;arca&s;tick
performance, imputed to Lord Bolingbroke and Swift,
inter&s;per&s;ed with &s;evere reflections upon the Union, the
Scotti&s;h nation, and the Duke of Argyle in particular.
The Lord-Trea&s;urer di&s;claimed all knowledge of the au|thor,
and readily concurred in an order for taking into
cu&s;tody John Morphew, the publi&s;her, as well as John
Barber, printer of the Gazette, from who&s;e hou&s;e the
copies were brought to Morphew. The Earl of Whartor
&s;aid it highly concerned the honour of that augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly
to find out the villain who was author of that fal&s;e and
&s;candalous libel, that ju&s;tice might be done to the Scotti&s;h
nation. He moved, that Barber and his &s;ervants might be
examined; but, next day, the Earl of Mar, one of the
Secretaries of State, declared, that, in pur&s;uance to he$
Maje&s;ty's command, he had directed John Barber to be
pro&s;ecuted. Notwith&s;tanding this interpo&s;ition, which
was calculated to &s;creen the offenders, the Lords pre&s;ented
an addre&s;s, be&s;eeching her Maje&s;ty to i&s;&s;ue out her roya$
proclamation, promi&s;ing a reward to any per&s;on who &s;hould
di&s;cover the author of the libel, which they conceived to be
fal&s;e, malicious, and factious, highly di&s;honourable and
&s;candalous to her Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects of Scotland, mo&s;t inju|rious
to her Maje&s;ty, and tending to the ruin of the con&s;ti|tution.
In compliance with their reque&s;t, a reward of three
hundred pounds was offered; but the author remained
&s;afe from all detection.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIV. The Commons having granted the &s;upplies
ordered a bill to be brought in for &s;ecuring the freedom of
parliaments, by limiting the number of officers in the
<PB N="255" REF="261">
Hou&s;e of Commons; and it pa&s;&s;ed through both Hou&s;es
with little difficulty. In March, a complaint was made
of &s;everal &s;candalous papers lately publi&s;hed, under the name
of Richard Steele, E&s;quire, a member of the Hou&s;e. Sir
William Wyndham ob&s;erved, that &s;ome of that author's
writings contained in&s;olent, injurious reflections on the
Queen her&s;elf, and were dictated by the &s;pirit of rebellion.
Steele was ordered to attend in his place: &s;ome paragraphs
of his works were read; and he an&s;wered them with an
affected air of &s;elf-confidence and unconcern. A day being
appointed for his trial, he acknowledged the writings, and
entered into a more circum&s;tantial defence. He was a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed
by Mr. Addi&s;on, General Stanhope, and Mr. Walpole;
and attacked by Sir William Wyndham, Mr. Foley, and
the Attorney-General. Whatever could be urged in his
favour was but little regarded by the majority, which voted,
that two pamphlets, entituled, &startq;The Engli&s;hman, and the
Cri&s;is,&endq; written by Richard Steele, E&s;quire, were &s;candalous
and &s;editious libels; and that he &s;hould be expelled the
Hou&s;e of Commons.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXV. The Lords, taking into con&s;ideration the
&s;tate of the nation, re&s;olved upon addre&s;&s;es to the Queen,
de&s;iring they might know what &s;teps had been taken for
removing the Pretender from the dominions of the Duke
of Lorraine: that &s;he would impart to them a detail of the
negociations for peace; a recital of the in&s;tances which
had been made in favour of the Catalans; and an account
of the monies granted by parliament &s;ince the year one
thou&s;and &s;even hundred and ten, to carry on the war in
Spain and Portugal. They afterwards agreed to other
addre&s;&s;es, be&s;eeching her Maje&s;ty to lay before them the
debts and &s;tate of the navy, the particular writs of Noli
Pro&s;equi granted &s;ince her acce&s;&s;ion to the throne; and a
li&s;t of &s;uch per&s;ons as, notwith&s;tanding &s;entence of out|lawry
or attainder, had obtained licences to return into
Great-Britain, or other of her Maje&s;ty's dominions, &s;ince the
Revolution. Having voted an application to the Queen
<PB N="256" REF="262">
in behalf of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Catalans, the Hou&s;e adjourned
it&s;elf to the la&s;t day of March. As the minds of men had
been artfully irritated by fal&s;e reports of a de&s;ign undertaken
by France in behalf of the Pretender, the amba&s;&s;ador of
that crown at the Hague, di&s;owned it in a publick paper,
by command of his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty. The &s;u&s;pi|cions
of many people, however, had been too deeply plant|ed
by the arts and in&s;inuations of the Whig leaders, to be
eradicated by this or any other declaration; and what
&s;erved to rivet their apprehen&s;ions, was a total removal of
the Whigs from all the employments, civil and military,
which they had hitherto retained. The&s;e were now be|&s;towed
upon profe&s;&s;ed Tories, &s;ome of whom were attach|ed
at bottom to the &s;uppo&s;ed heir of blood. At a time
when the Queen's views were maliciou&s;ly mi&s;repre&s;ented;
when the wheels of her government were actually impeded,
and her &s;ervants threatened with pro&s;cription by a power|ful,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Boyer.</NOTE>
turbulent, and implacable faction; no wonder that
&s;he di&s;charged the parti&s;ans of that faction from her &s;ervice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet.</NOTE>
and filled their places with tho&s;e who were di&s;tingui&s;hed
by a warm affection to the hou&s;e of Stuart,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tindal.</NOTE> and by a &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive
re&s;pect for the regal authority.<NOTE PLACE="marg">To$cy.</NOTE> Tho&s;e were &s;teps
which her own &s;agacity mu&s;t have &s;ugge&s;ted;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bolingbroke</NOTE> and which
her mini&s;ters would naturally advi&s;e as nece&s;&s;ary for their
own pre&s;ervation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Voltaire.</NOTE> The Whigs were all in commotion,
either apprehending, or affecting to apprehend, that a de|&s;ign
was formed to &s;ecure the Pretender's &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the
throne of Great-Britain.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1714.</NOTE> Their chiefs held &s;ecret con&s;ul|tations
with Baron Schutz, the re&s;ident from Hanover.
They communicated their ob&s;ervations to the Elector:
they received his in&s;tructions: they maintained a corre|&s;pondence
with the Duke of Marlborough; and they con|certed
mea&s;ures for oppo&s;ing all efforts that might be made
again&s;t the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion upon the death of the
Queen, who&s;e health was by this time &s;o much impaired,
that every week was believed to be the la&s;t of her life.
This conduct of the Whigs was re&s;olute, active, and
would have been laudable, had their zeal been confined
<PB N="257" REF="263">
within the bounds of truth and moderation;<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XI. 1714.</NOTE> but they,
moreover, employed all their arts to excite and encourage
the fears and jealou&s;ies of the people.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVI. The Hou&s;e of Peers re&s;ounded with debates
upon the Catalans, the Pretender, and the danger that
threatened the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. With re&s;pect to the
Catalonians, they repre&s;ented, that Great-Britain had
prevailed upon them to declare for the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria,
with promi&s;e of &s;upport; and that the&s;e engagements
ought to have been made good. Lord Bolingbroke de|clared
that the Queen had u&s;ed all her endeavours in their
behalf; and that her engagements with them &s;ub&s;i&s;ted no
longer than King Charles re&s;ided in Spain. They agreed,
however, to an addre&s;s, acknowledging her Maje&s;ty's en|deavours
in favour of the Catalans, and reque&s;ting &s;he
would continue her interpo&s;ition in their behalf. With
re&s;pect to the Pretender, the Whig lords expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch a
&s;pirit of per&s;ecution and rancorous hate, as would have
di&s;graced the members of any, even the lowe&s;t a&s;&s;embly
of Chri&s;tians. Not contented with hunting him from one
country to another, they &s;eemed eagerly bent upon extir|pating
him from the face of the earth, as if they had
thought it was a crime in him to be born. The Earl
of Sunderland declared, from the information of the mi|ni&s;ter
of Lorraine, that, notwith&s;tanding the application
of both Hou&s;es to her Maje&s;ty during the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion,
concerning the Pretender's being removed from Lorraine,
no in&s;tances had yet been made to the Duke for that pur|po&s;e.
Lord Bolingbroke affirmed that he him&s;elf had
made tho&s;e in&s;tances, in the Queen's name, to that very
mini&s;ter before his departure from England. The Earl of
Wharton propo&s;ed a que&s;tion, &startq;Whether the prote&s;tant
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion was in danger under the pre&s;ent admini&s;tra|tion?&endq;
A warm debate en&s;ued, in which the Arch|bi&s;hop
of York and the Earl of Angle&s;ey joined in the op|po&s;ition
to the mini&s;try. The Earl pretended to be con|vinced
and converted by the arguments u&s;ed in the cour&s;e
of the debate. He owned he had given his a&s;&s;ent to the
<PB N="258" REF="264">
ce&s;&s;ation of arms,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK I. 1714.</NOTE> for which he took &s;hame to him&s;elf,
a&s;king pardon of God, his country, and his con&s;cience.
He affirmed that the honour of his &s;overeign, and the good
of his country, were the rules of his actions; but that,
without re&s;pect of per&s;ons, &s;hould he find him&s;elf im|po&s;ed
upon, he dur&s;t pur&s;ue an evil mini&s;ter from the
Queen's clo&s;et to the Tower, and from the Tower to the
&s;caffold. This conver&s;ion, however, was much more
owing to a full per&s;ua&s;ion that a mini&s;try divided again&s;t
it&s;elf could not long &s;ub&s;i&s;t, and that the prote&s;tant &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
was firmly &s;ecured. He, therefore, re&s;olved to make
a merit of withdrawing him&s;elf from the intere&s;ts of a
tottering admini&s;tration, in who&s;e ruin he might be in|volved.
The Duke of Argyle charged the mini&s;ters with
mal-admini&s;tration, both within tho&s;e walls and without:
he offered to prove that the Lord-Trea&s;urer had yearly
remitted a &s;um of money to the Highland clans of Scot|land,
who were known to be entirely devoted to the Pre|tender.
He affirmed that the new modelling of the army,
the practice of di&s;banding &s;ome regiments out of their
turn, and removing a great number of officers, on account
of their affection to the Hou&s;e of Hanover, were clear in|dications
of the mini&s;try's de&s;igns; that it was a di&s;grace
to the nation to &s;ee men who had never looked an enemy
in the face advanced to the po&s;ts of &s;everal brave officers,
who, after they had often expo&s;ed their lives for their
country, were now &s;tarving in pri&s;on for debt, on account
of their pay's being detained. The Trea&s;urer, laying his
hand upon his brea&s;t, &s;aid he had on &s;o many occa&s;ions
given &s;uch &s;ignal proofs of affection to the prote&s;tant &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion,
that he was &s;ure no member of that augu&s;t a&s;&s;em|bly
did call it in que&s;tion. He owned he had remitted,
for two or three years pa&s;t, between three and four thou|&s;and
pounds to the Highland clans; and he hoped the
Hou&s;e would give him an opportunity to clear his con|duct
in that particular; with re&s;pect to the reformed of|ficers,
he declared he had given orders for their being
<PB N="259" REF="265">
immediately paid. The prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was voted out
of danger, by a &s;mall majority.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVII. Lord Hallifax propo&s;ed an addre&s;s to the
Queen, that &s;he would renew her in&s;tances for the &s;peedy
removing the Pretender out of Lorraine; and that &s;he
would, in conjunction with the States-General, enter into
the guarantee of the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the Hou&s;e of
Hanover. The Earl of Wharton moved that in the ad|dre&s;s
her Maje&s;ty &s;hould be de&s;ired to i&s;&s;ue a proclamation,
promi&s;ing a reward to any per&s;on who &s;hould apprehend
the Pretender dead or alive. He was &s;econded by the
Duke of Bolton; and the Hou&s;e agreed that an addre&s;s
&s;hould be pre&s;ented. When it was reported by the com|mittee,
Lord North and Grey expatiated upon the bar|barity
of &s;etting a price on any one's head: He proved it
was an encouragement to murther and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination; con|trary
to the precepts of Chri&s;tianity; repugnant to the
law of nature and nations; incon&s;i&s;tent with the dignity
of &s;uch an augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly, and with the honour of a na|tion
famed for lenity and mercy. He was &s;upported by
Lord Trevor, who moved that the reward &s;hould be pro|mi&s;ed
for apprehending and bringing the Pretender to
ju&s;tice, in ca&s;e he &s;hould land or attempt to land in Great-Britain
or Ireland. The cruelty of the fir&s;t clau&s;e was
zealou&s;ly &s;upported and vindicated by the Lords Cowper
and Hallifax; but by this time the Earl of Angle&s;ey and
&s;ome others, who had abandoned the mini&s;try, were brought
back to their former principles, by promi&s;e of profitable
employments; and the mitigation was adopted by a ma|jority
of ten voices. To this addre&s;s, which was delivered
by the Chancellor and the Whig lords only, the Queen
replied in the&s;e words: &startq;My lords, it would be a real
&s;trengthening to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the Hou&s;e of Hanover,
as well as a &s;upport to my government, that an end
were put to tho&s;e groundle&s;s &s;ears and jealou&s;ies which
have been &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly promoted. I do not at
this time &s;ee any occa&s;ion for &s;uch a proclamation.
Whenever I judge it to be nece&s;&s;ary, I &s;hall give my
<PB N="260" REF="266">
orders for having it i&s;&s;ued. As to the other particulars
of this addre&s;s, I will give proper directions therein.&endq;
She was likewi&s;e importuned, by another addre&s;s, to i&s;&s;ue
out a proclamation again&s;t all je&s;uits, popi&s;h prie&s;ts, and
bi&s;hops, as well as again&s;t all &s;uch as were outlawed for
adhering to the late King James and the Pretender. The
Hou&s;e re&s;olved, That no per&s;on, not included in the ar|ticles
of Limerick, and who had bor'n arms in France
and Spain, &s;hould be capable of any employment civil or
military: and that no per&s;on, a natural-born &s;ubject of
her Maje&s;ty, &s;hould be capable of &s;u&s;taining the character
of a publick mini&s;ter from any foreign potentate. The&s;e
re&s;olutions were aimed at Sir Patrick Lawle&s;s, an Iri&s;h pa|pi&s;t,
who had come to England with a credential letter from
King Philip, but now thought proper to quit the king|dom.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVIII. Then the lords in the oppo&s;ition made
an attack upon the Trea&s;urer, concerning the money he
had remitted to the Highlanders: but Oxford &s;ilenced his
oppo&s;ers, by a&s;&s;erting, that in &s;o doing he had followed
the example of King William, who, after he had reduced
that people, thought fit to allow yearly pen&s;ions to the
heads of clans, in order to keep them quiet. His conduct
was approved by the Hou&s;e; and Lord North and Grey
moved, that a day might be appointed for con&s;idering the
&s;tate of the nation, with regard to the treaties of peace
and commerce. The motion was &s;econded by the Earl of
Clarendon; and the thirteenth day of April fixed for this
purpo&s;e. In the mean time, Baron Schutz demanded of
the Chancellor a writ for the Electoral Prince of Hanover,
to &s;it in the Hou&s;e of Peers as Duke of Cambridge, in|timating
that his de&s;ign was to re&s;ide in England. The
writ was granted with reluctance; but the Prince's de|&s;ign
of coming to England was &s;o di&s;agreeable to the
Queen, that &s;he &s;ignified her di&s;approbation of &s;uch a &s;tep
in a letter to the Prince&s;s Sophia. She ob&s;erved that
&s;uch a method of proceeding would be dangerous to the
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion it&s;elf, which was not &s;ecure any other way,
<PB N="261" REF="267">
than as the prince who was in actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
throne maintained her authority and prerogative: &s;he &s;aid
a great many people in England were &s;editiou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed;
&s;o &s;he left her highne&s;s to judge what tumults they might
be able to rai&s;e &s;hould they have a pretext to begin a
commotion: &s;he, therefore, per&s;uaded her&s;elf that her aunt
would not con&s;ent to any thing which might di&s;turb the
repo&s;e of her and her &s;ubjects. At the &s;ame time &s;he wrote
a letter to the Electoral Prince, complaining that he had
formed &s;uch a re&s;olution, without fir&s;t knowing her &s;en|timents
on the &s;ubject; and telling him plainly, that
nothing could be more dangerous to the tranquillity of her
dominions, to the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the Hanoverian
line, or more di&s;agreeable to her, than &s;uch conduct at
this juncture. A third letter was written to the Elector,
his father; and the Trea&s;urer took this opportunity to a&s;|&s;ure
that prince of his inviolable attachment to the family
of Hanover.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIX. The Whig lords were di&s;&s;atisfied with the
Queen's an&s;wer to their addre&s;s concerning the Pretender;
and they moved for another addre&s;s on the &s;ame &s;ubject,
which was re&s;olved upon, but never pre&s;ented. They
took into con&s;ideration the treaties of peace and com|merce,
to which many exceptions were taken; and much
&s;arca&s;m was expended on both &s;ides of the di&s;pute; but
at length the majority carried the que&s;tion in favour of an
addre&s;s, acknowledging her Maje&s;ty's goodne&s;s, in de|livering
them, by a &s;afe, honourable, and advantageous
peace with France, from the burthen of a con&s;uming land-war,
unequally carried on, and become at la&s;t impracti|cable.
The Hou&s;e of Commons concurred in this addre&s;s,
after having voted that the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was out
of danger; but the&s;e re&s;olutions were not taken without
violent oppo&s;ition, in which General Stanhope, Mr. Lech|mere,
and Mr. Walpole, chiefly di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves.
The letters which the Queen had written to the Electoral
hou&s;e of Hanover were printed and publi&s;hed in England,
with a view to inform the friends of that family of the
<PB N="262" REF="268">
rea&s;ons which prevented the Duke of Cambridge from
executing his de&s;ign of re&s;iding in Great Britain. The
Queen con&s;idered this &s;tep as a per&s;onal in&s;ult, as well as an
attempt to prejudice her in the opinions of her &s;ubjects;
&s;he, therefore, ordered the publi&s;her to be taken into cu&s;to|dy.
At this period the Prince&s;s Sophia died, in the eighty-fourth
year of her age; and her death was intimated to the
Queen by Baron Bothmar, who arrived in England with
the character of envoy extraordinary from the Elector of
Hanover. This prince&s;s was the fourth and younge&s;t daugh|ter
of Frederick, Elector Palatine, King of Bohemia, and
Elizabeth, daughter of King James I. of England. She
enjoyed from nature an excellent capacity, which was &s;inely
cultivated; and was in all re&s;pects one of the mo&s;t accom|pli&s;hed
prince&s;&s;es of the age in which &s;he lived. At her
death the court of England appeared in mourning; and
the Elector of Brun&s;wick was prayed for by name in the
liturgy of the church of England. On the twelfth day of
May, Sir William Wyndham made a motion for a bill to
prevent the growth of &s;chi&s;m, and for the further &s;ecurity
of the church of England as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed. The de|&s;ign
of it was to prohibit di&s;&s;enters from teaching in &s;chools
and academies. It was accordingly prepared, and eagerly
oppo&s;ed in each Hou&s;e as a &s;pecies of per&s;ecution. Never|thele&s;s,
it made its way through both, and received the
royal a&s;&s;ent; but the Queen dying before it took place, this
law was rendered ineffectual.</P>
<P>&sect; XL. Her Maje&s;ty's con&s;titution was now quite broken;
one &s;it of &s;ickne&s;s &s;ucceeded another; what completed the
ruin of her health was the anxiety of her mind, occa|&s;ioned
partly by the di&s;contents which had been rai&s;ed and
fomented by the enemies of her government; and partly
by the di&s;&s;entions among her mini&s;ters, which were now
become intolerable. The council-chamber was turned
into a &s;cene of ob&s;tinate di&s;pute and bitter altereation.
Even in the Queen's pre&s;ence the Trea&s;urer and Secretary
did not ab&s;tain from, mutual obloquy and reproach.
<PB N="263" REF="269">
Oxford advi&s;ed moderate mea&s;ures, and is &s;aid to have
made advances towards a reconciliation with the leaders
of the Whig party. As he fore&s;aw it would &s;oon be
their turn to domineer, &s;uch precautions were nece&s;&s;ary
for his own &s;afety. Bolingbroke affected to &s;et the
Whigs at defiance; he profe&s;&s;ed a warm zeal for the
church; he &s;oothed the Queen's inclinations with the
mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous attention. He and his coadjutrix in|&s;inuated,
that the Trea&s;urer was bia&s;&s;ed in favour of the
di&s;&s;enters, and even that he acted as a &s;py for the hou&s;e
of Hanover. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e di&s;putes and commo|tions
the Jacobites were not idle. They flattered them|&s;elves
that the Queen in &s;ecret favoured the preten|&s;ions
of her brother; and they depended upon Boling|broke's
attachment to the &s;ame intere&s;t. They believed
the &s;ame &s;entiments were cheri&s;hed by the nation in gene|ral.
They held private a&s;&s;emblies both in Great-Britain
and in Ireland. They concerted mea&s;ures for turning
the di&s;&s;entions of the kingdom to the advantage of their
cau&s;e. They even proceeded &s;o far as to inli&s;t men for
the &s;ervice of the Pretender. Some of the&s;e practices
were di&s;covered by the Earl of Wharton, who did not fail
to &s;ound the alarm. A proclamation was immediately
publi&s;hed, promi&s;ing a reward of five thou&s;and pounds
for apprehending the Pretender whenever he &s;hould land
or attempt to land in Great-Britain. The Commons
voted an addre&s;s of thanks for the proclamation; and
a&s;&s;ured her Maje&s;ty, that they would chearfully aid and
a&s;&s;i&s;t her, by granting the &s;um of an hundred thou&s;and
pounds, as a further reward to any who &s;hould perform
&s;o great a &s;ervice to her Maje&s;ty and her kingdoms. The
Lords likewi&s;e pre&s;ented an addre&s;s on the &s;ame &s;ubject.
Lord Bolingbroke propo&s;ed a bill, decreeing the penalties
of high-trea&s;on again&s;t tho&s;e who &s;hould li&s;t or be inli&s;ted
in the Pretender's &s;ervice. The motion was approved,
and the penalty extended to all tho&s;e who &s;hould li&s;t or be
inli&s;ted in the &s;ervice of any foreign prince or &s;tate,
<PB N="264" REF="270">
without a licence under the &s;ign manual of her Maje&s;ty,
her heirs, or &s;ucce&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>&sect; XLI. On the &s;econd day of July, the Lords took into
con&s;ideration the treaty of commerce with Spain; and a
great number of merchants being examined at the bar of
the Hou&s;e, declared that unle&s;s the explanations of the
third, fifth, and eighth articles, as made at Madrid after
the treaty was &s;igned, were re&s;cinded, they could not carry
on their commerce without lo&s;ing five-and-twenty per cent.
After a long debate, the Hou&s;e re&s;olved to addre&s;s the
Queen for all the papers relating to the negociation of
the treaty of commerce with Spain, with the names of the
per&s;ons who advi&s;ed her Maje&s;ty to that treaty. To this
addre&s;s &s;he replied, that under&s;tanding the three explana|tory
articles of the treaty were not detrimental to the
trade of her &s;ubjects, &s;he had con&s;ented to their being
ratified with the treaty. The Earl of Wharton repre|&s;ented,
that if &s;o little regard was &s;hown to the addre&s;&s;es
of that augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly to the &s;overeign, they had no bu&s;i|ne&s;s
in that hou&s;e. He moved for a remon&s;trance, to lay
before her Maje&s;ty the in&s;uperable difficulties that at|tended
the Spani&s;h trade on the footing of the late treaty;
and the Hou&s;e agreed to his motion. Another member
moved, that the Hou&s;e &s;hould in&s;i&s;t on her Maje&s;ty's
naming the per&s;ons who advi&s;ed her to ratify the three
explanatory articles. This was a blow aimed at Arthur
Moore, a member of the Lower Hou&s;e, whom Lord Bo|lingbroke
had con&s;ulted on the &s;ubject of the treaty. He
was &s;creened by the majority in parliament; but a general
court of the South-Sea company re&s;olved, upon a com|plaint
exhibited by Captain John&s;on, that Arthur Moore,
while a director, was privy to, and encouraged the de&s;ign
of carrying on a clande&s;tine trade, to the prejudice of the
corporation, contrary to his oath, and in breach of the
tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him; that, therefore, he &s;hould be declared
incapable of being a director of, or having any employ|ment
in this company. The Queen had re&s;erved to her|&s;elf
<PB N="265" REF="271">
the quarter part of the a&s;&s;iento-contract, which &s;he
now gave up to the company, and received the thanks of
the Upper Hou&s;e; but &s;he would not di&s;cover the names
of tho&s;e who advi&s;ed her to ratify the explanatory articles.
On the ninth day of July, &s;he thought proper to put an
end to the &s;e&s;&s;ion, with a &s;peech on the u&s;ual &s;ubjects.
After having a&s;&s;ured them, that her chief concern was to
pre&s;erve the prote&s;tant religion, the liberty of her &s;ubjects,
and to &s;ecure the tranquillity of her kingdoms, &s;he con|cluded
in the&s;e words: &startq;But I mu&s;t tell you plainly,
that the&s;e de&s;ireable ends can never be obtained, unle&s;s
you bring the &s;ame di&s;po&s;itions on your parts, unle&s;s
all groundle&s;s jealou&s;ies, which create and foment divi|&s;ions
among you, be laid a&s;ide; and unle&s;s you &s;how the
&s;ame regard for my ju&s;t prerogative, and for the honour
of my government, as I have always expre&s;&s;ed for the
rights of my people.&endq;</P>
<P>&sect; XLII. After the peace had thus received the &s;anction
of the parliament, the mini&s;ters, being no longer re&s;trained
by the tie of common danger, gave a loo&s;e to their mu|tual
animo&s;ity. Oxford wrote a letter to the Queen,
containing a detail of the publick tran&s;actions; in the
cour&s;e of which he endeavoured to ju&s;tify his own con|duct,
and expo&s;e the turbulent and ambitious &s;pirit of his
rival. On the other hand, Bolingbroke charged the Trea|&s;urer
with having invited the Duke of Marlborough to
return from his voluntary exile; and maintained a pri|vate
corre&s;pondence with the hou&s;e of Hanover. The
Duke of Shrew&s;bury likewi&s;e complained of his having
pre&s;umed to &s;end orders to him in Ireland, without the
privity of her Maje&s;ty and the council. In all probability
his greate&s;t crime was his having given umbrage to the
favourite, Lady Ma&s;ham. Certain it is, on the twenty-&s;eventh
day of July, a very acrimonious dialogue pa&s;&s;ed
between that lady, the Chancellor, and Oxford, in the
Queen's pre&s;ence. The Trea&s;urer affirmed he had been
wronged, and abu&s;ed by lies and mi&s;repre&s;entations; but
he threatened vengeance, declaring he would leave &s;ome
<PB N="266" REF="272">
people as low as he had found them when they fir&s;t attract|ed
his notice. In the mean time he was removed from his
employment; and Bolingbroke &s;eemed to triumph in the
victory he had obtained. He laid his account with being
admitted as chief mini&s;ter into the admini&s;tration of affairs;
and is &s;aid to have formed the de&s;ign of a coalition with
the Duke of Marlborough, who at this very time em|barked
at O&s;tend for England. Probably, Oxford had
tried to play the &s;ame game, but met with a repul&s;e from
the Duke, on account of the implacable re&s;entment which
the Duche&s;s had conceived again&s;t that mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIII. Whatever &s;chemes might have been formed,
the fall of the Trea&s;urer was &s;o &s;udden, that no plan was
e&s;tabli&s;hed for &s;upplying the vacancy occa&s;ioned by his
di&s;grace. The confu&s;ion that ince&s;&s;antly en&s;ued at court,
and the fatigue of attending a long cabinet-council on
this event, had &s;uch an effect upon the Queen's &s;pirits
and con&s;titution, that &s;he declared &s;he &s;hould not outlive
it, and was immediately &s;ei&s;ed with a lethargick di&s;order.
Notwith&s;tanding all the medicines which the phy&s;icians
could pre&s;cribe, the di&s;temper gained ground &s;o fa&s;t, that
next day, which was the thirtieth of July, they de&s;paired
of her life. Then the committee of the council a&s;&s;embled
at the Cockpit adjourned to Ken&s;ington. The Dukes of
Somer&s;et and Argyle, informed of the de&s;perate &s;ituation
in which &s;he lay, repaired to the palace; and, without
being &s;ummoned, entered the council-chamber. The
members were &s;urpri&s;ed at their appearance; but the Duke
of Shrew&s;bury thanked them for their readine&s;s to give
their a&s;&s;i&s;tance at &s;uch a critical juncture; and de&s;ired
they would take their places. The phy&s;icians having de|clared
that the Queen was &s;till &s;en&s;ible, the council unani|mou&s;ly
agreed to recommend the Duke of Shrew&s;bury as
the $word$ per&s;on to fill the place of lord-trea&s;urer. When
this opinion was intimated to the Queen, &s;he &s;aid, they
could not have recommended a per&s;on &s;he liked better
than the Duke of Shrew&s;bury. She delivered to him the
white &s;taff, bidding him u&s;e it for the good of her people.
<PB N="267" REF="273">
He would have returned the lord-chamberlain's &s;taff, but
&s;he de&s;ired he would keep them both: &s;o that he was at
one time po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the three greate&s;t po&s;ts in the king|dom,
under the titles of lord-trea&s;urer, lord-chamberlain,
and lord-lieutenant of Ireland. No nobleman in England
better de&s;erved &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hing marks of his &s;overeign's
favour. He was mode&s;t, liberal, di&s;intere&s;ted, and a warm
friend to his country. Bolingbroke's ambition was de|feated
by the vigour which the Dukes of Somer&s;et and
Argyle exerted on this occa&s;ion. They propo&s;ed, that
all privy-coun&s;ellors in or about London &s;hould be in|vited
to attend, without di&s;tinction of party. The motion
was approved; and Lord Somers, with many other Whig
members, repaired to Ken&s;ington. The council being thus
re-enforced began to provide for the &s;ecurity of the king|dom.
Orders were immediately di&s;patched to four regi|ments
of hor&s;e and dragoons quartered in remote counties,
to march up to the neighbourhood of London and We&s;t|min&s;ter.
Seven of the ten Briti&s;h battalions in the Nether|lands
were directed to embark at O&s;tend for England, with
all po&s;&s;ible expedition: an embargo was laid upon all
&s;hipping; and directions given for equipping all the &s;hip$
of war that could be &s;oone&s;t in a condition for &s;ervice.
They &s;ent a letter to the Elector of Brun&s;wick, &s;ignifying
that the phy&s;icians had de&s;paired of the Queen's life; in|forming
him of the mea&s;ures they had taken; and de&s;iring
he would, with all convenient &s;peed, repair to Holland,
where he &s;hould be attended by a Briti&s;h &s;quadron, to
convey him to England, in ca&s;e of her Maje&s;ty's decea&s;e.
At the &s;ame time they di&s;patched in&s;tructions to the Earl
of Strafford, to de&s;ire the States-General would be ready
to perform the guarantee of the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.
The heralds at arms were kept in waiting, with a troop of
hor&s;e-guards, to proclaim the new king as &s;oon as the
throne &s;hould become vacant. Precau&s;tions were taken to
&s;ecure the &s;ea-ports; to over-awe the Jacobites in Scotland;
and the command of the fleet was be&s;towed upon the Earl
of Berkeley.</P>

&sect; XLIV. The Queen continued to doze in a lethargick
in&s;en&s;ibility, with very &s;hort intervals, till the fir&s;t day of
Augu&s;t in the morning, when &s;he expired, in the fiftieth
year of her age, and in the thirteenth of her reign. Anne
Stuart, Queen of Great-Britain, was in her per&s;on of the
middle &s;ize, well proportioned. Her hair was of a dark
brown colour, her complexion ruddy, her features were
regular, her countenance was rather round than oval, and
her a&s;pect more comely than maje&s;tick. Her voice was
clear and melodious, and her pre&s;ence engaging. Her ca|pacity
was naturally good, but not much cultivated by
learning; nor did &s;he exhibit any marks of extraordinary
genius, or per&s;onal ambition. She was certainly deficient
in that vigour of mind by which a prince ought to pre|&s;erve
his independence, and avoid the &s;nares and $word$
&s;ycophants and favourites: but whatever her $word$
this particular might have been, the virtues of her heart
were never called in que&s;tion. She was a pattern of con|jugal
affection and fidelity, a tender mother, a warm friend,
an indulgent mi&s;tre&s;s, a munificent patron, a mild and
merciful prince, during who&s;e reign no &s;ubject's blood was
&s;hed for trea&s;on. She was zealou&s;ly attached to the church
of England from conviction rather than from prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,
unaffectedly pious, ju&s;t, charitable, and compa&s;&s;ionate. She
felt a mother's fondne&s;s for her people, by whom &s;he was
univer&s;ally beloved with a warmth of affection which even
the prejudice of party could not abate. In a word, if
&s;he was not the greate&s;t, &s;he was certainly one of the be&s;t
and mo&s;t unblemi&s;hed &s;overeigns that ever &s;at upon the
throne of England; and well de&s;erved the expre&s;&s;ive, though
&s;imple epithet of &startq;The good Queen Anne.&endq;</P>

<PB N="270" REF="276">
<P>&sect; I. IT may be nece&s;&s;ary to remind the reader of the
&s;tate of party at this important juncture. The
Jacobites had been fed with hopes of &s;eeing the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
altered by the Earl of Oxford. The&s;e hopes he had con|veyed
to them in a di&s;tant, undeterminate, and my&s;terious
manner, without any other view than that of preventing
them from taking violent mea&s;ures to embarra&s;s his ad|mini&s;tration.
At lea&s;t, if he actually entertained at one
time any other de&s;ign, he had, long before his di&s;grace,
laid it wholly a&s;ide, probably from an apprehen&s;ion of the
danger with which it mu&s;t have been attended; and &s;eemed
bent upon making a merit of his zeal for the hou&s;e of
Hanover: but his conduct was &s;o equivocal and un&s;teady,
that he ruined him&s;elf in the opinion of one party, without
acquiring the confidence of the other. The friends of the
<PB N="271" REF="277">
Pretender derived fre&s;h hopes from the mini&s;try of Boling|broke.
Though he had never explained him&s;elf on this
&s;ubject, he was &s;uppo&s;ed to favour the heir of blood, and
known to be an implacable enemy to the Whigs, who
were the mo&s;t zealous advocates for the prote&s;tant &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion.
The Jacobites promi&s;ed them&s;elves much from
his affection, but more from his re&s;entment: and they
believed the majority of the Tories would join them on
the &s;ame maxims. All Bolingbroke's &s;chemes of power
were defeated by the promotion of the Duke of Shrew&s;|bury
to the office of Trea&s;urer; and all his hopes bla&s;ted
by the death of the Queen, on who&s;e per&s;onal favour he
depended. The re&s;olute behaviour of the Dukes of Somer|&s;et
and Argyle, together with the diligence and activity of
a council in which the Whig intere&s;t had gained the a&s;|cendency,
completed the confu&s;ion of the Tories, who
found them&s;elves without a head, divided, di&s;tracted, and
irre&s;olute. Upon recollection, they &s;aw nothing &s;o eligible
as &s;ilence, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to tho&s;e mea&s;ures which they
could not oppo&s;e with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. They had
no other objection to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the Hou&s;e of Hano|ver,
but the fear of &s;eeing the Whig faction once more
predominant: yet they were not without hope that their
new &s;overeign, who was reputed a prince of &s;agacity
and experience, would cultivate and conciliate the
affection of the Tories, who were the landholders and
proprietors of the kingdom, rather than declare him&s;elf
the head of a faction which leaned for &s;upport on tho&s;e
who were enemies to the church and monarch, on the
Bank and the monied-intere&s;t, rai&s;ed upon u&s;ury, and
maintained by corruption. In a word, the Whigs were
elated and overbearing; the Tories aba&s;hed and humble;
the Jacobites eager, impatient, and alarmed at a juncture
which, with re&s;pect to them, was truely critical.</P>
<P>&sect; II. The Queen had no &s;ooner re&s;igned her la&s;t breath,
than the privy-council met, and the Archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury,
the Lord Chancellor, and the Hanoverian re&s;ident,
Kreyenberg, produced the three in&s;truments in which the
<PB N="272" REF="278">
Elector of Brun&s;wick had nominated the per&s;on<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The&s;e were the Dukes of Shrew&s;bury, Somer&s;et, Bolton, Devon&s;hire, Kent, Argyle, Montro&s;e, and Roxburgh&mdash;the Earls of Pom&s;ret, Angle&s;ey, Carli&s;le, Nottingham, Abingdon, Scarborough, and O$ford&mdash;Lord Vi&s;count Town&s;hend, and Lords Hallifax and Cowper.</NOTE> to be
added as lords ju&s;tices to the &s;even great officers of the
realm. Orders were immediately i&s;&s;ued for proclaiming
King George, in England, Scotland, and Ireland. The
regency appointed the Earl of Dor&s;et to carry to Hanover
the intimation of his Maje&s;ty's acce&s;&s;ion, and attend him
in his journey to England. They &s;ent the general officers
in whom they could confide to their re&s;pective po&s;ts: they
re-enforced the garri&s;on of Port&s;mouth: they appointed
Mr. Addi&s;on their &s;ecretary; while Bolingbroke was
obliged to &s;tand at the door of the council-chamber with
his bag and papers, and underwent every &s;pecies of morti|fication.
On the whole, King George a&s;cended the throne
of Great-Britain in the fifty-fifth year of his age, without
the lea&s;t oppo&s;ition, tumult, or &s;ign of popular di&s;content;
and the unprejudiced part of the nation was now fully
per&s;uaded that no de&s;ign had ever been concerted by Queen
Anne and her mini&s;try in favour of the Pretender. The
Mayor of Oxford received a letter, requiring him to pro|claim
the Pretender. This being communicated to the
Vice-Chancellor, a copy of it was immediately tran&s;mitted
to Mr. Secretary Bromley, member of parliament for the
Univer&s;ity; and the Vice-Chancellor offered a reward of
one hundred pounds to any per&s;on who &s;hould di&s;cover
the author. It was either the production of &s;ome luna|tick,
or a weak contrivance to fix an odium on that venera|ble
body.</P>
<P>&sect; III. The parliament having a&s;&s;embled, pur&s;uant to the
act which regulated the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, the Lord Chancellor,
on the fifth day of Augu&s;t, made a &s;peech to both Hou&s;es
in the name of the regency. He told them, that the privy-council
appointed by the Elector of Brun&s;wick had pro|claimed
that prince under the name of King George, as
the lawful and rightful &s;overeign of the&s;e kingdoms; and
that they had taken the nece&s;&s;ary care to maintain the
<PB N="273" REF="279">
publick peace. He ob&s;erved, that the &s;everal branches of
the publick revenue were expired by the demi&s;e of her late
Maje&s;ty: and recommended to the Commons the making
&s;uch provi&s;ion in that re&s;pect as might be requi&s;ite to &s;up|port
the honour and dignity of the crown. He likewi&s;e
expre&s;&s;ed his hope, that they would not be wanting in any
thing that might conduce to the e&s;tabli&s;hing and advancing
of the publick credit. Both Hou&s;es immediately agreed to
addre&s;&s;es, containing the warme&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of duty and
affection to their new &s;overeign, who did not fail to return
&s;uch an&s;wers as were very agreeable to the parliament of
Great-Britain. In the mean time, the Lower Hou&s;e pre|pared
and pa&s;&s;ed a bill, granting to his Maje&s;ty the &s;ame
civil-li&s;t which the Queen had enjoyed; with additional
clau&s;es for the payment of arrears due to the troops of
Hanover, which had been in the &s;ervice of Great-Britain;
and for a reward of one hundred thou&s;and pounds, to be
paid by the Trea&s;ury to any per&s;on who &s;hould apprehend
the Pretender in landing, or in attempting to land, in any
part of the Briti&s;h dominions. Mr. Craggs, who had
been di&s;patched to Hanover before the Queen died, return|ing
on the thirteenth day of Augu&s;t, with letters from the
King to the regency, they went to the Hou&s;e of Peers:
then the Chancellor, in another &s;peech to both Hou&s;es,
intimated his Maje&s;ty's great &s;atisfaction in the loyalty
and affection which his people had univer&s;ally expre&s;&s;ed
at his acce&s;&s;ion. Other addre&s;&s;es were voted on this oc|ca&s;ion.
The Commons fini&s;hed the bill for the civil-li&s;t,
and one for making &s;ome alterations in an act for a &s;tate
lottery, which received the royal a&s;&s;ent from the lords
ju&s;tices. Then the parliament was prorogued.</P>
<P>&sect; IV. Mr. Prior having notified the Queen's death to
the court of Ver&s;ailles, Louis declared that he would in|violably
maintain the treaty of peace concluded at Utrecht,
particularly with relation to the &s;ettlement of the Briti&s;h
crown in the hou&s;e of Hanover. The Earl of Strafford
having &s;ignified the &s;ame event to the States of Holland;
and the re&s;ident of Hanover having pre&s;ented them with a
<PB N="274" REF="280">
letter, in which his ma&s;ter claimed the performance of
their guarantee, they re&s;olved to perform their engage|ments,
and congratulated his Electoral Highne&s;s on his
acce&s;&s;ion to the throne of Great-Britain. They invited
him to pa&s;s through their dominions; and a&s;&s;ured him that
his intere&s;ts were as dear to them as their own. The
Chevalier St. George no &s;ooner received the news of
the Queen's death, than he po&s;ted to Ver&s;ailles, where he
was given to under&s;tand, that the King of France ex|pected
he &s;hould quit his territories immediately; and he
was accordingly obliged to return to Lorraine. By this
time Mr. Murray had arrived in England from Hano|ver,
with notice that the King had deferred his departure
for &s;ome days. He brought orders to the regency to pre|pare
a patent for creating the Prince-Royal Prince of
Wales; and for removing Lord Bolingbroke from his po&s;t
of &s;ecretary. The &s;eals were taken from this mini&s;ter by
the Dukes of Shrew&s;bury and Somer&s;et, and Lord Cow|per,
who at the &s;ame time &s;ealed up all the doors of his
office.</P>
<P>&sect; V. King George having ve&s;ted the government of his
German dominions in a council, headed by his brother
Prince Erne&s;t, &s;et out with the Electoral Prince from
Herenhau&s;en on the thirty-fir&s;t day of Augu&s;t; and in five
days arrived at the Hague, where he conferred with the
States-General. On the &s;ixteenth day of September
he embarked at Orange-Polder, under convoy of an En|gli&s;h
and Dutch &s;quadron, commanded by the Earl of
Berkeley; and next day arrived at the Hope. In the after|noon
the yacht &s;ailed up the river; and his Maje&s;ty, with
the Prince, were landed from a barge at Greenwich, about
&s;ix in the evening. There he was received by the Duke
of Northumberland, captain of the life-guards, and the
lords of the regency. From the landing-place he walked
to his hou&s;e in the Park, accompanied by a great number
of the nobility, and other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, who had
the honour to ki&s;s his hand, as they approached. When
he retired to his bed-chamber, he &s;ent for tho&s;e of the
<PB N="275" REF="281">
nobility who had di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by their zeal for
his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion: but the Duke of Ormond, the Lord Chan|cellor,
and Lord Trevor were not of the number. Next
morning, the Earl of Oxford pre&s;ented him&s;elf with an
air of confidence, as if he had expected to receive &s;ome
particular mark of his Maje&s;ty's favour: but he had the
mortification to remain a con&s;iderable time undi&s;tingui&s;hed
among the croud; and then was permitted to ki&s;s the
King's hand, without being honoured with any other
notice. On the other hand, his Maje&s;ty expre&s;&s;ed un|common
regard for the Duke of Marlborugh, who had
lately arrived in England, as well as for all the leaders of
the Whig party.</P>
<P>&sect; VI. It was the mi&s;fortune of this prince, as well as
a very great prejudice to the nation, that he had been
mi&s;led into &s;trong prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions again&s;t the Tories, who
con&s;tituted &s;uch a con&s;iderable part of his &s;ubjects. They
were now excluded from all &s;hare of the royal favour,
which was wholly engro&s;&s;ed by their enemies: the&s;e early
marks of aver&s;ion, which he was at no pains to conceal,
alienated the minds of many from his per&s;on and govern|ment,
who would otherwi&s;e have &s;erved him with fidelity
and affection. An in&s;tantaneous and total change was
effected in all offices of honour and advantage. The
Duke of Ormond was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his command, which
the King re&s;tored to the Duke of Marlborough, whom
he likewi&s;e appointed colonel of the fir&s;t regiment of foot|guards,
and ma&s;ter of the Ordnance. The great &s;eal
was given to Lord Cowper; the privy &s;eal to the
Earl of Wharton; the government of Ireland to the Earl
of Sunderland. The Duke of Devon&s;hire was made
&s;teward of the hou&s;ehold: Lord Town&s;hend and Mr.
Stanhope were appointed &s;ecretaries of &s;tate: the po&s;t of
&s;ecretary for Scotland was be&s;towed upon the Duke of
Montro&s;e. The Duke of Somer&s;et was con&s;tituted ma|&s;ter
of the hor&s;e: the Duke of St. Alban's captain of the
band of pen&s;ioners; and the Duke of Argyle commander
in chief of the forces in Scotland. Mr. Pulteney
<PB N="276" REF="282">
became &s;ecretary at war; and Mr. Walpole, who had al|ready
undertaken to manage the Hou&s;e of Commons, was
gratified with the double place of payma&s;ter to the army
and to Chel&s;ea-ho&s;pital. A new privy-council was ap|pointed,
and the Earl of Nottingham declared pre&s;ident:
but all affairs of con&s;equence were concerted by a cabinet-council,
or junto, compo&s;ed of the Duke of Marlborough,
the Earls of Nottingham and Sunderland, the Lords Hal|lifax,
Town&s;hend, and Somers, and General Stanhope.
The regency had already removed Sir Con&s;tantine Phipps
and the Archbi&s;hop of Armagh from the office of lords
ju&s;tices in Ireland, and filled their places in the regency of
that kingdom with the Archbi&s;hop of Dublin and the Earl
of Kildare. Allan Broderick was appointed chancellor:
another privy-council was formed; and the Duke of Or|mond
was named as one of the members. The Trea&s;ury
and Admiralty were put into commi&s;&s;ion: all the govern|ments
were changed; and, in a word, the whole nation
was delivered into the hands of the Whigs. At the &s;ame
time, the Prince-Royal was declared Prince of Wales,
and took his place in council. The King was congratu|lated
on his acce&s;&s;ion in addre&s;&s;es from the two univer&s;ities,
and from all the cities and corporations in the kingdom.
He expre&s;&s;ed particular &s;atisfaction at the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions of
loyalty and affection. He declared in council his firm
purpo&s;e to &s;upport and maintain the churches of England
and Scotland as they were by law e&s;tabli&s;hed. An aim
which he imagined might be effectually accompli&s;hed,
without impairing the toleration allowed by law to pro|te&s;tant
di&s;&s;enters, and &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the trade and riches
of the kingdom: he, moreover, a&s;&s;ured them he would
earne&s;tly endeavour to render property &s;ecure; the good
effects of which were no where &s;o clearly &s;een as in this
happy nation. Before the coronation he created &s;ome new
peers, and others were promoted to higher titles.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">James, Lord Chandos, was created Earl of Caerna$von&mdash;Lewis, Lord Rockingham, Earl of that name&mdash;Charles, Lord O&s;&s;ulton, Earl of $$$$$$|ville&mdash;Charles, Lord Hallifax, Earl of Hallifax&mdash;Heneage, Lord $word$ Earl of Aylesford&mdash;John, Lord Hervey, Earl of Bri&s;tol&mdash;Thomas, Lord Pel|ham, Earl of Clare&mdash;Henry, Earl of Thomond, in Ireland, Vi&s;count Tad|ca&s;ter&mdash;James, Vi&s;count Ca&s;tleton, in Ireland, Baron Sander&s;on&mdash;Bennet, Lord She$$ard, in Ireland, Baron of Ha$$borough&mdash;Gerva&s;e, Lord Pierrepoint, in $leand, Baron P$$$$epoint, in the county of Bucks&mdash;Henry Boyle, Pa$$on of $arleton, in the county of York&mdash;Sir Richard Temple, Baron of Cobh$m.&mdash;Henry, Lord Paget Earl of U$bridge.</NOTE>. On
<PB N="277" REF="283">
the twentieth day of October, he was crowned in We&s;t|min&s;ter
with the u&s;ual &s;olemnity, at which the Earl of
Oxford and Lord Bolingbroke a&s;&s;i&s;ted<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In the month of October, the Prince&s;s of Wales arrived in England, with $r two elde&s;t daughters, the Prince&s;&s;es Anne and Amelia.</NOTE>. On that very
day, the univer&s;ity of Oxford, in full convocation, unani|mou&s;ly
conferred the degree of doctor of civil law on Sir
Con&s;tantine Phipps, with particular marks of honour and
e&s;teem. As the French King was &s;aid to protract the de|molition
of Dunkirk, Mr. Prior received orders to pre|&s;ent
a memorial to ha&s;ten this work, and to prevent the
canal of Mardyke from being fini&s;hed. The an&s;wer which
he received being deemed equivocal, this mini&s;ter was re|called,
and the Earl of Stair appointed amba&s;&s;ador to the
court of France, where he pro&s;ecuted this affair with un|common
vigour. About the &s;ame time, General Cadogan
was &s;ent as plenipotentiary to Antwerp, to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the
barrier-treaty, negociated there between the Emperor and
the States-General.</P>
<P>&sect; VII. Mean while, the number of the malcontents in
England was con&s;iderably increa&s;ed by the King's attach|ment
to the Whig faction. The clamour of the church's
being in danger was revived; jealou&s;ies were excited;
&s;editious libels di&s;per&s;ed; and dangerous tumults rai&s;ed
in different parts of the kingdom. Birmingham, Bri&s;tol,
Chippenham, Norwich, and Reading were filled with
licentious riot. The party cry was, &startq;Down with
the Whigs! Sacheverel for ever!&endq; Many gentlemen
of the Whig faction were abu&s;ed; magi&s;trates in towns,
and ju&s;tices in the country, were reviled and in&s;ulted by
the populace in the execution of their office. The Pre|tender
took this opportunity to tran&s;mit, by the French
mail, copies of a printed manife&s;to to the Dukes of
<PB N="278" REF="284">
Shrew&s;bury, Marlborough, Argyle, and other noblemen
of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction. In this declaration, he mentioned
the good intentions of his &s;i&s;ter towards him, which were
prevented by her deplorable death. He ob&s;erved that his
people, in&s;tead of doing him and them&s;elves ju&s;tice, had
proclaimed for their king a foreign prince, contrary to the
fundamental and inconte&s;table laws of hereditary right,
which their pretended acts of &s;ettlement could never ab|rogate.
The&s;e papers being delivered to the &s;ecretaries of
&s;tate, the King refu&s;ed an audience to the Marquis de
Lamberti, mini&s;ter from the Duke of Lorraine, on the &s;up|po&s;ition
that this manife&s;to could not have been prepared
or tran&s;mitted without the knowledge and countenance
of his ma&s;ter. The Marquis having communicated this
circum&s;tance to the Duke, that prince ab&s;olutely denied
his having been privy to the tran&s;action, and declared that
the Chevalier de St. George came into Lorraine by the
directions of the French King, whom the Duke could
not di&s;oblige without expo&s;ing his territories to inva&s;ion.
Notwith&s;tanding this apology, the Marquis was given to
under&s;tand, that he could not be admitted to an audience
until the Pretender &s;hould be removed from the dominions
of his ma&s;ter: he, therefore, quitted the kingdom without
further he&s;itation. Religion was &s;till mingled in all po|litical
di&s;putes. The high-church-men complained th$$
impiety and here&s;y daily gained ground, from the con|nivance,
or at lea&s;t the &s;u$ine negligence of the Whig
prelates. The Lower Hou&s;e of Convocation had, before
the Queen's death, declared that a book publi&s;hed by Dr.
Samuel Clarke, under the title of &startq;The Scripture-Doctrine
of the Trinity,&endq; contained a&s;&s;ertions contrary
to the catholick &s;aith. They &s;ent up extracts from this
performance to the bi&s;hops; and the Doctor wrote an
an&s;wer to their objections. He was prevailed upon to
write an apology, which he pre&s;ented to the Upper Hou&s;e:
but apprehending it might be publi&s;hed &s;eparately, and
mi&s;under&s;tood, he afterwards delivered an explanation to the
the Bi&s;hop of London. This was &s;atisfactory to the
<PB N="279" REF="285">
bi&s;hops; but the Lower Hou&s;e re&s;olved, that it was no re|cantation
of his heretical a&s;&s;ertions. The di&s;putes about the
Trinity increa&s;ing, the archbi&s;hops and bi&s;hops received di|rections,
which were publi&s;hed, for pre&s;erving unity in the
church, the purity of the chri&s;tian faith concerning the holy
Trinity, and for maintaining the peace and quiet of the
&s;tate. By the&s;e every preacher was re&s;tricted from deliver|ing
any other doctrine than what is contained in the holy
&s;criptures with re&s;pect to the Trinity; and from intermed|dling
in any affairs of &s;tate or government. The like pro|hibition
was extended to tho&s;e who &s;hould write, harangue,
or di&s;pute on the &s;ame &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>&sect; VIII. The parliament being di&s;&s;olved, another was
called by a very extraordinary proclamation, in which the
King complained of the evil de&s;igns of men di&s;affected to
his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and of their having mi&s;repre&s;ented his
conduct and principles. He mentioned the perplexity of
publick affairs, the interruption of commerce, and the
heavy debts of the nation. He expre&s;&s;ed his hope that his
loving &s;ubjects would &s;end up to parliament the fitte&s;t per|&s;ons
to redre&s;s the pre&s;ent di&s;orders; and that, in the
elections, they would have a particular regard to &s;uch as
$ad expre&s;&s;ed a firm attachment to the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
when it was in danger. It does not appear that the pro|te&s;tant
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion was ever in danger. How then was this
declaration to be interpreted? People in general con|&s;trued
it into a de&s;ign to maintain party-di&s;tinctions, and
encourage the Whigs to the full exertion of their influ|ence
in the elections; into a renunciation of the Tories;
and as the fir&s;t &s;la&s;h of that vengeance which afterwards
was &s;een to bur&s;t upon the heads of the late mini&s;try.
When the Earl of Strafford returned from Holland, all
his papers were &s;ei&s;ed by an order from the &s;ecretary's
office. Mr. Prior was recalled from France, and promi&s;ed
to di&s;cover all he knew relating to the conduct of Ox|ford's
admini&s;tration. Uncommon vigour was exerted on
both &s;ides in the elections; but, by dint of the monied-in|tere&s;t,
<PB N="280" REF="286">
which prevailed in mo&s;t of the corporations through
the kingdom, and the countenance of the mini&s;try, which
will always have weight with needy and venal electors, a
great majority of Whigs was returned both in England and
Scotland.</P>
<P>&sect; IX. When this new parliament a&s;&s;embled on the
&s;eventeenth day of March at We&s;tmin&s;ter, Mr. Spencer
Compton was cho&s;en Speaker of the Commons. On the
twenty-fir&s;t day of the month, the King appeared in the
Hou&s;e of Lords, and delivered to the Chancellor a written
&s;peech, which was read in pre&s;ence of both Hou&s;es. His
Maje&s;ty thanked his faithful and loving &s;ubjects for that
zeal and firmne&s;s they had &s;hown in defence of the pro|te&s;tant
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion, again&s;t all the open and &s;ecret practices
which had been u&s;ed to defeat it. He told them, that
&s;ome conditions of the peace, e&s;&s;ential to the &s;ecurity and
trade of Great-Britain, were not yet duly executed; and
that the performance of the whole might be looked upon
as precarious, until defen&s;ive alliances &s;hould be formed
to guarantee the pre&s;ent treaties. He ob&s;erved that the
Pretender boa&s;ted of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance he expected in England,
to repair his former di&s;appointments: that great part of
the national trade was rendered impracticable: and that the
publick debts were &s;urpri&s;ingly increa&s;ed, even &s;ince the
fatal ce&s;&s;ation of arms. He gave the Commons to under|&s;tand,
that the branches of the revenue formerly granted
for the &s;upport of the civil government were &s;o far en|cumbered
and alienated, that the produce of the funds
which remained, and had been granted to him, would fall
&s;hort of what was at fir&s;t de&s;igned for maintaining the
honour and dignity of the crown: that as it was his, and
their happine&s;s to &s;ee a Prince of Wales who might in due
time &s;ucceed him on the throne; and to &s;ee him ble&s;&s;ed
with many children; the&s;e circum&s;tances would naturally
occa&s;ion an expen&s;e to which the nation had not been for
many years accu&s;tomed; and, therefore, he did not doubt
but they would think of it with that a&s;&s;ection which he
had rea&s;on to hope from his Commons. He de&s;ired that
<PB N="281" REF="287">
no unhappy divi&s;ions of parties might divert them from pur|&s;uing
the common intere&s;t of their country. He declared
that the e&s;tabli&s;hed con&s;titution in church and &s;tate &s;hould
be the rule of his government; and that the happine&s;s, ea&s;e,
and pro&s;perity, of his people &s;hould be the chief care of his
life. He concluded with expre&s;&s;ing his confidence, that
with their a&s;&s;i&s;tance he &s;hould di&s;appoint the de&s;igns of
tho&s;e who wanted to deprive him of that ble&s;&s;ing which he
mo&s;t valued, the affection of his people.</P>
<P>&sect; X. Speeches &s;ugge&s;ted by a vindictive mini&s;try better
became the leader of an incen&s;ed party, than the father
and &s;overeign of a divided people. This declaration por|tended
mea&s;ures which it was the intere&s;t of the crown to
avoid, and &s;uited the temper of the majority in both Hou&s;es,
which breathed nothing but de&s;truction to their political
adver&s;aries. The Lords, in their addre&s;s of thanks, pro|fe&s;&s;ed
their hope that his Maje&s;ty, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the parliament,
would be able to recover the reputation of the kingdom in
foreign parts, the lo&s;s of which they hoped to convince the
world by their actions was by no means to be imputed to
the nation in general. The Tories &s;aid this was an in|vidious
reflection, calculated to mi&s;lead and inflame the
people; for the reputation of the kingdom had never been
&s;o high as at this very juncture. The Commons pretended
a&s;toni&s;hment to find that any conditions of the late peace
&s;hould not yet be duly executed; and that care was not
taken to form &s;uch alliances as might have rendered the
peace not precarious. They declared their re&s;olution to
enquire into the&s;e fatal mi&s;carriages; to trace out tho&s;e
mea&s;ures whereon the Pretender placed his hopes, and
bring the authors of them to condign puni&s;hment. The&s;e
addre&s;&s;es were not voted without oppo&s;ition. In the Hou&s;e
of Lords, the Dukes of Buckingham and Shrew&s;bury,
the Earl of Angle&s;ey, the Archbi&s;hop of York, and other
peers, both &s;ecular and eccle&s;ia&s;tical, ob&s;erved, that their
addre&s;s was injurious to the late Queen's memory, and
would &s;erve only to increa&s;e tho&s;e unhappy divi&s;ions that
di&s;tracted the kingdom. In the Lower Hou&s;e, Sir William
<PB N="282" REF="288">
Wyndham, Mr. Bromley, Mr. Shippin, General Ro&s;s, Sir
William Whitelock, and other members, took exceptions
to pa&s;&s;ages of the &s;ame nature, in the addre&s;s which the
Commons had prepared. They were an&s;wered by Mr.
Walpole, Mr. Pulteney, and Mr. Secretary Stanhope.
The&s;e gentlemen took occa&s;ion to declare, that, notwith|&s;tanding
the endeavours which had been u&s;ed to prevent a
di&s;covery of the late mi&s;managements, by conveying away
&s;everal papers from the &s;ecretary's office, yet the govern|ment
had &s;ufficient evidence left, to prove the late mini&s;try
the mo&s;t corrupt that ever &s;at at the helm: that tho&s;e mat|ters
would &s;oon be laid before the Hou&s;e, when it would
appear that a certain Engli&s;h general had acted in concert
with, if not received orders from, Mar$&s;$hal de Villars.
Lord Bolingbroke, who had hitherto appeared in publick,
as u&s;ual, with remarkable &s;erenity, and &s;poke in the Hou&s;e
of Lords with great freedom and confidence, thought it
was now high time to con&s;ult his per&s;onal &s;afety.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bover.</NOTE> He ac|cordingly
withdrew to the continent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tindal.</NOTE> leaving a letter which
was afterwards printed in his ju&s;tification.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tor$y.</NOTE> In this paper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bolingbroke</NOTE>
he declared he had received certain and repeated informa|tions
that a re&s;olution was taken to pur&s;ue him to the &s;caf|fold:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Voltaire.</NOTE>
that if there had been the lea&s;t rea&s;on to hope for a
fair and open tryal, after having been already prejudged,
unheard, by the two Hou&s;es of parliament, he &s;hould not
have declined the &s;tricte&s;t examination. He challenged the
mo&s;t invet$$ate of his enemies to produce any one in&s;tance
of criminal corre&s;pondence, or the lea&s;t corruption in any
part of the admini&s;tration in which he was concerned. He
&s;aid, if his zeal for the honour and dignity of his royal
mi&s;tre&s;s, and the true intere&s;t of his country, bad any where
tran&s;ported him to let &s;lip a warm and unguarded expre&s;|&s;ion,
he hoped the mo&s;t favourable interpretation would be
put upon it. He affirmed that he had &s;eved her Maje&s;ty
faithfully and dutifully, in that e&s;pecially which &s;he had
mo&s;t at heart, relieving her people from a bloody and ex|pen&s;ive
war; and that he had always been too much an
<PB N="283" REF="289">
Engli&s;hman to &s;acrifice the intere&s;t of his country to any
foreign ally what&s;oever.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. I. An. 1715.</NOTE></P>
<P>&sect; XI. In the mid&s;t of all this violence again&s;t the late mi|ni&s;ters,
friends were not wanting to e&s;pou&s;e their cau&s;e in
the face of oppo&s;ition; and even in &s;ome addre&s;&s;es to the
King their conduct was ju&s;tified. Nay, &s;ome individuals
had courage enough to attack the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration.
When a motion was made in the Hou&s;e of Commons, to
con&s;ider the King's proclamation for calling a new parlia|ment,
Sir William Whitelocke, member for the univer&s;ity
of Oxford, boldly declared it was unprecedented and un|warrantable.
Being called upon to explain him&s;elf, he
made an apology. Neverthele&s;s, Sir William Wyndham
ri&s;ing up, &s;aid the proclamation was not only unprecedented
and unwarrantable, but even of dangerous con&s;equence to
the very being of parliaments. When challenged to ju&s;|tify
his charge, he ob&s;erved, that every member was free to
&s;peak his thought. Some exclaimed, &startq;The Tower!
the Tower! A warm debate en&s;ued; Sir William being
ordered to withdraw, was accompanied by one hundred
and twenty-nine members; and tho&s;e who remained in the
Hou&s;e re&s;olved, That he &s;hould be reprimanded by the
Speaker. He was accordingly rebuked, for having pre|&s;umed
to reflect on his Maje&s;ty's proclamation, and having
made an unwarrantable u&s;e of the freedom of &s;peech
granted by his Maje&s;ty. Sir William &s;aid he was not con|&s;cious
of having offered any indignity to his Maje&s;ty, or of
having been guilty of a breach of privilege: that he acqui|e&s;ced
in the determination of the Hou&s;e; but had no thanks
to give to tho&s;e gentlemen who, under pretence of lenity,
had &s;ubjected him to this cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>&sect; XII. On the ninth day of April, General Stanhope
delivered to the Hou&s;e of Commons fourteen volumes,
con&s;i&s;ting of all the papers relating to the late negociations
of peace and commerce, as well as to the ce&s;&s;ation of arms;
and moved that they might be referred to a &s;elect com|mittee
of twenty per&s;ons, who &s;hould dige&s;t the &s;ub&s;tance
<PB N="284" REF="290">
of them under proper heads,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1715.</NOTE> and report them, with their
ob&s;ervations to the Hou&s;e. One more was added to the
number of this &s;ecret committee, which was cho&s;en by
ballot; and met that &s;ame evening. Robert Walpole,
original chairman, being taken ill, was &s;ucceeded in that
place by Mr. Stanhope. The whole number was &s;ub|divided
into three committees: to each a certain number
of books was allotted; and they carried on the enquiry
with great eagerne&s;s and expedition. Before this mea&s;ure
was taken, Dr. Gilbert Burnet, Bi&s;hop of Sarum, died of a
pleuritick fever, in the &s;eventy-&s;econd year of his age:
immediately after the committee had begun to act, the
Whig party lo&s;t one of their warme&s;t champions, by the
death of the Marquis of Wharton, a nobleman po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of happy talents for the cabinet, the &s;enate, and the com|mon
&s;cenes of life; talents, which a life of plea&s;ure and li|bertini&s;m
did not prevent him from employing with &s;ur|pri&s;ing
vigour and application. The committee of the
Lower Hou&s;e taking the civil-li&s;t into con&s;ideration, ex|amined
&s;everal papers relating to that revenue. The To|ries
ob&s;erved, that from the &s;even hundred thou&s;and pounds
granted annually to King William, fifty thou&s;and pounds
were allotted to the late Queen, when Prince&s;s of Denmark;
twenty thou&s;and pounds to the Duke of Glouce&s;ter; and
twice that &s;um as a dowry to James's Queen: that near
two hundred thou&s;and pounds had been yearly deducted
from the revenues of the late Queen's civil-li&s;t, and ap|plied
to other u&s;es; notwith&s;tanding which deduction,
&s;he had honourably maintained her family, and &s;upported
the dignity of the crown. In the cour&s;e of the debate
&s;ome warm altercation pa&s;&s;ed between Lord Guern&s;ey and
one of the members, who affirmed that the late mini&s;try
had u&s;ed the Whigs, and, indeed, the whole nation in
&s;uch a manner, that nothing they &s;hould &s;uffer could be
deemed a hard&s;hip. At length, the Hou&s;e agreed that the
&s;um of &s;even hundred thou&s;and pounds clear &s;hould be
granted for the civil-li&s;t during his Maje&s;ty's life. A
motion being made for an addre&s;s again&s;t pen&s;ions, it was
<PB N="285" REF="291">
oppo&s;ed by Mr. Walpole, and over-ruled by the majority.
The Lords pa&s;&s;ed the bill for regulating the land-forces,
with &s;ome amendments.</P>
<P>&sect; XIII. On the eighteenth day of May, Sir John Norris
failed with a &s;trong &s;quadron to the Baltick, in order to
protect the commerce of the nation, which had &s;uffered
from the King of Sweden, who cau&s;ed all &s;hips trading to
tho&s;e parts to be &s;ei&s;ed and confi&s;cated. That prince had
rejected the treaty of neutrality concerted by the allies for
the &s;ecurity of the empire; and con&s;idered the Engli&s;h and
Dutch as his enemies. The mini&s;ters of England and the
States-General had pre&s;ented memorials to the regency of
Sweden; but finding no redre&s;s, they re&s;olved to protect
their trade by force of arms. After the Swedi&s;h general
Steenboch and his army were made pri&s;oners, Count
Wellen concluded a treaty with the admini&s;trator of Hol|&s;tein-Gottorp,
by which the towns of Stetin and Wi&s;mar
were &s;eque&s;tered into the hands of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia.
The admini&s;trator engaged to &s;ecure them, and all the re&s;t
of Swedi&s;h Pomerania, from the Poles and Mu&s;covites;
but, as the governor of Pomerania refu&s;ed to comply with
this treaty, tho&s;e allies marched into the province, &s;ubdued
the i&s;land of Rugen, and obliged Stetin to &s;urrender.
Then the governor con&s;ented to the &s;eque&s;tration, and paid
to the Poles and Mu&s;covites four hundred thou&s;and rix|dollars,
to indemnify them for the expen&s;e of the &s;iege.
The King of Sweden returning from Turkey, rejected the
treaty of &s;eque&s;tration, and in&s;i&s;ted upon Stetin's being
re&s;tored, without his repaying the money. As this mo|narch
likewi&s;e threatened to invade the electorate of
Saxony, and cha&s;ti&s;e his fal&s;e friends, King George, for
$he &s;ecurity of his German dominions, concluded a treaty
with the King of Denmark; by which the duchies of
Bremen and Verden, which had been taken from the
Swede in his ab&s;ence, were made over to his Britannick
Maje&s;ty, on condition that he &s;hould immediately declare
$ar again&s;t Sweden. Accordingly, he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
$he duchies in October; publi&s;hed a declaration of war
<PB N="286" REF="292">
again&s;t Charles in his German dominions; and detached
&s;ix thou&s;and Hanoverians to join the Danes and Pru&s;&s;ians
in Pomerania. The&s;e allies reduced the i&s;lands of Rugen
and Uledon, and attacked the towns of Wi&s;mar and
Stral&s;und, from which la&s;t place Charles was obliged to
retire in a ve&s;&s;el to Schonen. He a&s;&s;embled a body of
troops, with which he propo&s;ed to pa&s;s the Sound upon
the ice, and attack Copenhagen; but was di&s;appointed by
a &s;udden thaw. Neverthele&s;s, he refu&s;ed to return to Stock|holm,
which he had not &s;een for &s;ixteen years; but remain|ed
at Carle&s;croon, in order to ha&s;ten his fleet for the relief
of Wi&s;mar.</P>
<P>&sect; XIV. The &s;pirit of di&s;content and di&s;affection &s;eemed
to gain ground every day in England. Notwith&s;tanding
proclamations again&s;t riots, and orders of the ju&s;tices for
maintaining the peace, repeated tumults were rai&s;ed by the
malcontents in the cities of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter.
Tho&s;e who celebrated the anniver&s;ary of the king's birth|day
with the u&s;ual marks of joy and fe&s;tivity were in|&s;ulted
by the populace; but, next day, which was the
anniver&s;ary of the re&s;toration, the whole city was lighted
up with bonfires and illuminations, and echoed with the
&s;ound of mirth and tumultuous rejoicing. The people
even obliged the life-guards who patroled through the
&s;treets, to join in the cry of &startq;High-church and Ormond!&endq;
and in Smithfield they burned a picture of King William.
Thirty per&s;ons were impri&s;oned for being concerned in
the&s;e riots. One Bournois, a &s;choolma&s;ter, who affirmed
that King George had no right to the crown, was tried,
and &s;courged through the city, with &s;uch &s;everity, that in
a few days he expired in the utmo&s;t torture. A frivolous
incident &s;erved to increa&s;e the popular ferment. The
&s;hirts allowed to the fir&s;t regiment of guards, commanded
by the Duke of Marlborough, were &s;o coar&s;e, that the
&s;oldiers could hardly be per&s;uaded to wear them. Some
were thrown into the garden of the King's palace, and
into that which belonged to the Duke of Marlborough.
A detachment, in marching through the city, produced
<PB N="287" REF="293">
them to the view of the &s;hopkeepers and pa&s;&s;engers, ex|claiming,
&startq;The&s;e are the Hanover &s;hirts.&endq; The court
being informed of this clamour, ordered tho&s;e new &s;hirts
to be burned immediately: but even this &s;acrifice, and an
adverti&s;ement publi&s;hed by the Duke of Marlborough in
his own vindication, did not acquit that general of a &s;u&s;|picion
that he was concerned in this mean &s;pecies of pecu|lation.
A reward of fifty pounds was offered by the go|vernment
to any per&s;on that would di&s;cover one Captain
Wight, who, by an intercepted letter, appeared to be
di&s;affected to King George; and Mr. George Jefferies was
&s;ei&s;ed at Dublin, with a packet directed to Dr. Jonathan
Swift, Dean of St. Patrick's. Several trea&s;onable papers
being found in this packet, were tran&s;mitted to England:
Jefferies was obliged to give bail for his appearance; and
Swift thought proper to ab&s;cond.</P>
<P>&sect; XV. The Hou&s;e of Lords, to demon&s;trate their abhor|rence
of all who &s;hould engage in con&s;piracies again&s;t their
&s;overeign, rejected with indignation a petition pre&s;ented
to them in behalf of Blackburn, Ca&s;&s;ils, Bernarde, Mel|drum,
and Chambers, who had hitherto continued pri|&s;oners,
for having con&s;pired again&s;t the life of King
William. On the ninth day of June, Mr. Walpole, as
chairman of the &s;ecret committee, declared to the Hou&s;e
of Commons, that the report was ready; and in the
mean time moved, That a warrant might be i&s;&s;ued by Mr.
Speaker for apprehending &s;everal per&s;ons, particularly Mr.
Matthew Prior and Mr. Thomas Harley, who being in
the Hou&s;e, were immediately taken into cu&s;tody. Then
$e recited the report, ranged under the&s;e different heads:
$he clande&s;tine negociation with Mon&s;ieur Menager: the
extraordinary mea&s;ures pur&s;ued to form the congre&s;s at
Utrecht: the tri&s;ling of the French plenipotentiaries, by
$he connivance of the Briti&s;h mini&s;ters: the negociation
about the renunciation of the Spani&s;h monarchy: the fatal
$$&s;pen&s;ion of arms: the &s;eizure of Ghent and Bruges, in
$$der to di&s;tre&s;s the allies and favour the French: the
$uke of Ormond's acting in concert with the French
<PB N="288" REF="294">
general: the Lord Bolingbroke's journey to France, to ne|gociate
a &s;eparate peace: Mr. Prior's and the Duke of
Shrew&s;bury's negociation in France: the precipitate con|clu&s;ion
of the peace at Utrecht. The report being read,
Sir Thomas Hanmer moved, That the con&s;ideration of it
&s;hould be adjourned to a certain day; and that in the mean
time the report &s;hould be printed for the peru&s;al of the
members: he was &s;econded by the Tories: a debate en&s;ued;
and the motion was rejected by a great majority.</P>
<P>&sect; XVI. This point being gained, Mr. Walpole im|peached
Henry Lord Vi&s;count Bolingbroke of high-trea&s;on,
and other high crimes and mi&s;demeanours. Mr. Hunger|ford
declared his opinion, that nothing mentioned in the
report, in relation to Lord Bolingbroke, amounted to high|trea&s;on;
and General Ro&s;s expre&s;&s;ed the &s;ame &s;entiment.
Then Lord Coning&s;by &s;tanding up, &startq;The worthy chair|man
(&s;aid he) ha$ impeached the hand, but I impeach
the head: he has impeached the clerk, and I the ju&s;tice:
he ha$ impeached the &s;cholar, and I the ma&s;ter. I
impeach Robert Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer
of high-trea&s;on, and other crimes and mi&s;demeanours.&endq;
Mr. Auditor Harley, Earl's brother, &s;poke in vindi|cation
of that mini&s;ter. He affirmed he had done nothing
but by the immediate command of his &s;overeign: that the
peace was a good peace, and approved as &s;uch by two par|liaments;
and that the facts charged to him in the report
amounted only to mi&s;demeanours: if the &s;anction of a par|liament,
which is the repre&s;entative and legi&s;lature of the
nation, be not &s;ufficient to protect a mini&s;ter from the
vengeance of his enemies, he can have no &s;ecurity. Mr.
Auditor Foley, the Earl's brother-in-law, made a &s;peech
to the &s;ame purpo&s;e: Sir Jo&s;eph Jekyll, a &s;taunch Whig,
and member of the &s;ecret committee, expre&s;&s;ed his doubt,
whether they had &s;ufficient matter or evidence to impeach
the Earl of high-trea&s;on. Neverthele&s;s, the Hou&s;e re|&s;olved
to impeach him, without a divi&s;ion. When he
appeared in the Hou&s;e of Lords next day, he found him|&s;elf
avoided by his brother peers, as infectious; and retired
<PB N="289" REF="295">
with &s;igns of confu&s;ion. Prior and Harley having been
examined by &s;uch of the committee as were ju&s;tices of the
peace for Middle&s;ex, Mr. Walpole informed the Hou&s;e
that matters of &s;uch importance appeared in Prior's exami|nation,
that he was directed to move them for that mem|ber's
being clo&s;ely confined. Prior was accordingly im|pri&s;oned,
and cut off from all communication. On the
twenty-fir&s;t day of June, Mr. Secretary Stanhope im|peached
James, Duke of Ormond, of high-trea&s;on, and
other high crimes and mi&s;demeanours. Mr. Archibald
Hutchin&s;on, one of the commi&s;&s;ioners of trade, &s;poke in
favour of the Duke. He expatiated on his noble birth
and qualifications: he enumerated the great &s;ervices per|formed
to the crown and nation by his grace and his an|ce&s;tors:
he ob&s;erved, that in the whole cour&s;e of his late
conduct, he had only obeyed the Queen's commands; and
he affirmed that all the allegations again&s;t him could not,
in the rigour of the law, be con&s;trued into high-trea&s;on.
Mr. Hutchin&s;on was &s;econded by General Lumley, who
urged that the Duke of Ormond had on all occa&s;ions
given &s;ignal proofs of his affection for his country, as
well as of per&s;onal courage; and that he had generou&s;ly
expended the be&s;t part of his e&s;tate, by living abroad in a
mo&s;t noble and &s;plendid manner, for the honour of his
&s;overeign. Sir Jo&s;eph Jekyll &s;aid, if there was room for
mercy, he hoped it would be &s;hown to that noble, ge|nerous,
and courageous peer, who had in a cour&s;e of
many years exerted tho&s;e great accompli&s;hments for the
good and honour of his country: that, as the &s;tatute of
Edward III. on which the charge of high-trea&s;on again&s;t
him was to be grounded, had been mitigated by &s;ub&s;equent
acts, the Hou&s;e ought not, in his opinion, to take ad|vantage
of that act again&s;t the Duke, but only impeach
him of high crimes and mi&s;demeanours. General Ro&s;s,
Sir William Wyndham, and the &s;peakers of that party,
did not abandon the Duke in this emergency: but all their
arguments and eloquence were lo&s;t upon the other faction,
by which they were greatly outnumbered. The que&s;tion
<PB N="290" REF="296">
being put, was carried for the impeachment of the Duke
of Ormond, who perceiving every thing conducted by a
furious &s;pirit of revenge, and that he could not expect the
benefit of an impartial trial, con&s;ulted his own &s;afety, by
withdrawing him&s;elf from the kingdom. On the twenty-&s;econd
day of June, the Earl of Strafford was likewi&s;e
impeached by Mr. Ai&s;laby, for having advi&s;ed the fatal
&s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms, and the &s;ei&s;ing of Ghent and Bruges;
as well as for having treated the mo&s;t &s;erene hou&s;e of
Hanover with in&s;olence and contempt. He was al&s;o de|fended
by his friends, but overpowered by his enemies.</P>
<P>&sect; XVII. When the articles again&s;t the Earl of Oxford
were read in the Hou&s;e, a warm debate aro&s;e upon the
eleventh, by which he was charged with having advi&s;ed
the French King in what manner Tournay might be
gained from the States-General. The que&s;tion being put,
Whether this article amounted to high-trea&s;on? Sir
Robert Raymond, formerly &s;ollicitor-general, maintained
the negative, and was &s;upported not only by Sir William
Wyndham, and the Tories, but al&s;o by Sir Jo&s;eph Jekyll.
This hone&s;t patriot &s;aid it was ever his principle to do
ju&s;tice to every body, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t; and
that it was the duty of an hone&s;t man never to act by a
&s;pirit of party: that he hoped he might pretend to have
&s;ome knowledge of the laws of the kingdom; and would
not &s;cruple to declare, that, in his judgement, the charge
in que&s;tion did not amount to high trea&s;on. Mr. Wal|pole
an&s;wered with great warmth, that there were &s;everal
per&s;ons both in and out of the committee, who did not
in the lea&s;t yield to that member in point of hone&s;ty, and
who were &s;uperior to him in the knowledge of the laws,
yet were &s;atisfied that the charge &s;pecified in the eleventh
article amounted to high-trea&s;on. This point being de|cided
again&s;t the Earl, and the other articles approved by the
Hou&s;e, Lord Coning&s;by, attended by the Whig member$,
impeached the Earl of Oxford at the bar of the Hou&s;e of
Lords, demanding, at the &s;ame time, that he might be
&s;eque&s;tered from parliament, and committed to &s;afe cu&s;tod$.
<PB N="291" REF="297">
A motion was made, that the con&s;ideration of the articles
might be adjourned. After a &s;hort debate the articles
were read: then the Tory lords moved that the judges
might be con&s;ulted. The motion being rejected, another
was made, that the Earl &s;hould be committed to &s;afe
cu&s;tody: this occa&s;ioned another debate, in which he him|&s;elf
&s;poke to the following purpo&s;e: That the whole
charge might be reduced to the negociations and conclu|&s;ion
of the peace: that the nation wanted a peace, he &s;aid,
nobody would deny: that the conditions of this peace
were as good as could be expected, con&s;idering the back|wardne&s;s
and reluctancy which &s;ome of the allies &s;howed
to come into the Queen's mea&s;ures: that the peace was
approved by two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive parliaments: that he had no
&s;hare in the affair at Tournay, which was wholly tran&s;|acted
by that unfortunate nobleman who had thought fit
to &s;tep a&s;ide: that, for his own part, he always acted by
the immediate directions and commands of the late Queen,
without offending again&s;t any known law; and, being
ju&s;tified by his own con&s;cience, was unconcerned for the
life of an in&s;ignificant old man: that, if mini&s;ters of &s;tate,
acting by the immediate commands of their &s;overeign, are
afterwards to be made accountable for their proceedings,
it might one day or other be the ca&s;e with all the mem|bers
of that augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly: that he did not doubt their
lord&s;hips, out of regard to them&s;elves, would give him an
equitable hearing: and that in the pro&s;ecution of the en|quiry
it would appear he had merited not only the in|dulgence,
but even the favour of this government. &startq;My
lords (&s;aid he) I am now to take my leave of your lord|&s;hips,
and of this honourable Hou&s;e, perhaps for ever.
I &s;hall lay down my life with plea&s;ure in a cau&s;e fa|voured
by my late dear royal mi&s;tre&s;s. When I con|&s;ider
that I am to be judged by the ju&s;tice, honour, and
virtue of my peers, I &s;hall acquie&s;ce, and retire with
great content; and, my lords, God's will be done.&endq;
The Duke of Shrew&s;bury having acquainted the Hou&s;e
that the Earl was very much indi&s;po&s;ed with the gravel,
<PB N="292" REF="298">
he was &s;uffered to remain at his own hou&s;e, in cu&s;tody
of the black-rod: in his way thither he was attended by
a great multitude of people, crying, &startq;High-church,
Ormond, and Oxford, for ever!&endq; Next day he was
brought to the bar; where he received a copy of the ar|ticles,
and was allowed a month to prepare his an&s;wer.
Though Dr. Mead declared that if the Earl &s;hould be
&s;ent to the Tower his life would be in danger, it was car|ried,
on a divi&s;ion, that he &s;hould be conveyed thither on
the &s;ixteenth day of July. During the debate, the Earl
of Angle&s;ey ob&s;erved that the&s;e impeachments were di&s;|agreeable
to the nation; and that it was to be feared &s;uch
violent mea&s;ures would make the &s;ceptre &s;hake in the
King's hands. This expre&s;&s;ion kindled the whole Hou&s;e
into a flame. Some members cried, &startq;To the Tower!&endq;
&s;ome, &startq;To order!&endq; The Earl of Sunderland declared,
that if the&s;e words had been &s;poken in another place, he
would have called the per&s;on that &s;poke them to an ac|count:
in the mean time, he moved that the noble lord
&s;hould explain him&s;elf. Angle&s;ey, dreading the re&s;ent|ment
of the Hou&s;e, was glad to make an apology; which
was accepted. The Earl of Oxford was attended to the
Tower by a prodigious concour&s;e of people, who did not
&s;cruple to exclaim again&s;t his per&s;ecutors. Tumults were
rai&s;ed in Stafford&s;hire, and other parts of the kingdom,
again&s;t the Whig party, which had depre&s;&s;ed the friends
of the church, and embroiled the nation. The Hou&s;e of
Commons pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the King, de&s;iring that
the laws might be vigorou&s;ly executed again&s;t the rioters.
They prepared the proclamation-act, decreeing that if any
per&s;ons, to the number of twelve, unlawfully a&s;&s;embled,
&s;hould continue together one hour after having been re|quired
to di&s;per&s;e by a ju&s;tice of peace or other officer,
and heard the proclamation again&s;t riots read in publick,
they &s;hould be deemed guilty of felony without benefit of
clergy.</P>
<P>&sect; XVIII. When the King went to the Hou&s;e of Peers,
on the twentieth day of July, to give the royal a&s;&s;ent to
<PB N="293" REF="299">
this, and &s;ome other bills, he told both Hou&s;es, that a
rebellion was actually begun at home; and that the nation
was threatened with an inva&s;ion from abroad. He, there|fore,
expected that the Commons would not leave the
kingdom in a defencele&s;s condition, but enable him to
take &s;uch mea&s;ures as &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary for the publick
&s;afety. Addre&s;&s;es in the u&s;ual &s;tyle were immediately pre|&s;ented
by the parliament, the convocation, the common-council
and lieutenancy of London, and the two univer|&s;ities:
but that of Oxford was received in the mo&s;t con|temptuous
manner; and the deputies were charged with
di&s;loyalty, on account of a fray which had happened be|tween
&s;ome recruiting officers and the &s;cholars of the uni|ver&s;ity.
The addre&s;&s;es from the kirk of Scotland, and the
di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ters of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter, met with
a much more gracious reception. The parliament forth|with
pa&s;&s;ed a bill, empowering the King to &s;ecure &s;u&s;|pected
per&s;ons, and to &s;u&s;pend the Habeas-corpus act in
that time of danger. A clau&s;e was added to a money-bill,
offering the reward of one hundred thou&s;and pounds to
&s;uch as &s;hould &s;ei&s;e the Pretender, dead or alive. Sir
George Byng was &s;ent to take the command of the fleet:
General Erle repaired to his government of Port&s;mouth:
the guards were encamped in Hyde-Park: Lord Irwin
was appointed governor of Hull, in the room of Brigadier
Sutton, who, together with Lord Wind&s;or, the Generals
Ro&s;s, Webb, and Stuart, were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the &s;ervice.
Orders were given for rai&s;ing thirteen regiments of dra|goons,
and eight of infantry; and the trained-bands were
kept in readine&s;s to &s;uppre&s;s tumults. In the mid&s;t of
the&s;e tran&s;actions the Commons added &s;ix articles to tho&s;e
exhibited again&s;t the Earl of Oxford. Lord Bolingbroke
was impeached at the bar of the Hou&s;e of Lords by Mr.
Walpole. Bills being brought in to &s;ummon him and the
Duke of Ormond to &s;urrender them&s;elves by the tenth of
September, or, in default thereof, to attaint them of high-trea&s;on,
they pa&s;&s;ed both Hou&s;es, and received the royal
a&s;&s;ent. On the la&s;t day of Augu&s;t, the Commons agreed
<PB N="294" REF="300">
to the articles again&s;t the Earl of Strafford, which being
pre&s;ented to the Hou&s;e of Lords, the Earl made a &s;peech
in his own vindication. He complained that his papers
had been &s;ei&s;ed in an unprecedented manner. He &s;aid, if
he had in his letters or di&s;cour&s;e dropped any unguarded
expre&s;&s;ions again&s;t &s;ome foreign mini&s;ters, while he had
the honour to repre&s;ent the crown of Great-Britain, he
hoped they would not be accounted criminal by a Briti&s;h
Hou&s;e of Peers: the de&s;ired he might be allowed a com|petent
time to an&s;wer the articles brought again&s;t him,
and have duplicates of all the papers which had either
been laid before the committee of &s;ecre&s;y, or remained in
the hands of government, to be u&s;ed occa&s;ionally in his
ju&s;tification. This reque&s;t was vehemently oppo&s;ed by
the leaders of the other party, until the Earl of Ilay re|pre&s;ented
that, in all civili&s;ed nations, all courts of ju|dicature,
except the Inqui&s;ition, allowed the per&s;ons ar|raigned
all that was nece&s;&s;ary for their ju&s;tification; and
that the Hou&s;e of Peers of Great-Britain ought not, in
this ca&s;e, to do any thing contrary to that honour and
equity for which they were &s;o ju&s;tly renowned throughout
all Europe. This ob&s;ervation made an impre&s;&s;ion on the
Hou&s;e, which re&s;olved that the Earl &s;hould be indulged
with copies of &s;uch papers as he might have occa&s;ion to u&s;e
in his defence.</P>
<P>&sect; XIX. On the third day of September, Oxford's an|&s;wer
was delivered to the Hou&s;e of Lords, who tran&s;mitted
it to the Commons. Mr. Walpole, having heard it read,
&s;aid it contained little more than a repetition of what had
been &s;ugge&s;ted in &s;ome pamphlets and papers which had
been publi&s;hed in vindication of the late mini&s;try: that it
was a fal&s;e and malicious libel, laying upon his royal
mi&s;tre&s;s the blame of all the pernicious mea&s;ures he had
led her into, again&s;t her own honour, and the good of his
country: that it was likewi&s;e a libel on the proceedings
of the Commons, &s;ince he endeavoured to clear tho&s;e per|&s;ons
who had already confe&s;&s;ed their guilt by &s;light. After
&s;ome debate, the Hou&s;e re&s;olved, That the an&s;wer of
<PB N="295" REF="301">
Robert Earl of Oxford &s;hould be referred to the committee
appointed to draw up articles of impeachment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. 1715.</NOTE> and prepare
evidence again&s;t the impeached Lords; and that the com|mittee
&s;hould prepare a replication to the an&s;wer. This
was accordingly prepared, and &s;ent up to the Lords. Then
the committee reported, That Mr. Prior had gro&s;sly preva|ricated
on his examination, and behaved with great con|tempt
of their authority. The Duke of Ormond and Lord
Vi&s;count Bolingbroke having omitted to &s;urrender them|&s;elves
within the time limited, the Hou&s;e of Lords ordered
the Earl-Mar&s;hal to raze out of the li&s;t of peers their names
and armorial bearings. Inventories were taken of their per|&s;onal
e&s;tates; and the Duke's atchievement, as knight of
the garter, was taken down from St. George's chapel at
Wind&s;or. A man of candour cannot, without an emotion
of grief and indignation, reflect upon the ruin of the noble
family of Ormond, in the per&s;on of a brave, generous, and
humane nobleman, to whom no crime was imputed, but
that of having obeyed the command of his &s;overeign. About
this period, the royal a&s;&s;ent was given to an act for encou|raging
loyalty in Scotland. By this law the tenant who
continued peaceable while his lord took arms in favour of
the Pretender was inve&s;ted with the property of the lands
he rented: on the other hand, it was decreed that the lands
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by any per&s;on guilty of high-trea&s;on &s;hould revert
to the &s;uperior of whom they were held, and be con&s;oli|dated
with the &s;uperiority; and that all entails and &s;ettle|ments
of e&s;tates, &s;ince the fir&s;t day of Augu&s;t, in favour of
children, with a fraudulent intent to avoid the puni&s;hment
of the law due to the offence of high-trea&s;on, &s;hould be null
and void. It likewi&s;e contained a clau&s;e for &s;ummoning &s;u&s;|pected
per&s;ons to find bail for their good behaviour, on pain
of being denounced rebels. By virtue of this clau&s;e all the
heads of the Jacobite clans, and other &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons,
were &s;ummoned to Edinburgh; and tho&s;e who did not
appear were declared rebels.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="302">
&sect; XX. By this time the rebellion was actually begun
in Scotland.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1715.</NOTE> The di&s;&s;entions occa&s;ioned in that country
by the Union had never been wholly appea&s;ed. Even
&s;ince the Queen's death, addre&s;&s;es were prepared in dif|ferent
parts of Scotland again&s;t the Union, which was
deemed a national grievance: and the Jacobites did not
fail to encourage this aver&s;ion. Though their hopes of
di&s;&s;olving that treaty were baffled by the indu&s;try and
other arts of the Revolutioners, who &s;ecured a majority
of Whigs in parliament, they did not lay a&s;ide their de|&s;ign
of attempting &s;omething of con&s;equence in favour of
the Pretender; but maintained a corre&s;pondence with the
malcontents of England, a great number of whom were
driven by apprehen&s;ion, hard u&s;age, and re&s;entment into
a &s;y&s;tem of politicks which otherwi&s;e they would not have
e&s;pou&s;ed. The Tories finding them&s;elves totally excluded
from any &s;hare in the government and legi&s;lature, and ex|po&s;ed
to the in&s;olence and fury of a &s;action which they
de&s;pi&s;ed, began to wi&s;h in earne&s;t for a revolution. Some
of them held private con&s;ultations, and communicated
with the Jacobites, who conveyed their &s;entiments to the
Chevalier de St. George, with &s;uch exaggerations as were
dictated by their own eagerne&s;s and extravagance. They
a&s;&s;ured the Pretender that the nation was wholly di&s;a&s;&s;ected
to the new government; and, indeed, the clamours, tu|mults,
and conver&s;ation of the people in general coun|tenanced
this a&s;&s;ertion. They promi&s;ed to take arms without
further delay in his favour; and engaged that the Tories
&s;hould join them at his fir&s;t landing in Great-Britain.
They, therefore, be&s;ought him to come over with all
po&s;&s;ible expedition, declaring that his appearance would
produce an immediate revolution. The Chevalier re|&s;olved
to take the advantage of this favourable di&s;po&s;ition.
He had recour&s;e to the French King, who had always
been the refuge of his family. Louis favoured him in
&s;ecret; and, notwith&s;tanding his late engagements with
England, cheri&s;hed the ambition of rai&s;ing him to the
throne of Great-Britain. He &s;upplied him privately with
<PB N="297" REF="303">
&s;ums of money, to prepare a &s;mall armament in the port of
Havre, which was equipped in the name of Depine d'Ani|caut;
and, without all doubt, his de&s;ign was to a&s;&s;i&s;t him
more effectually, in proportion as the Engli&s;h &s;hould mani|fe&s;t
their attachment to the hou&s;e of Stuart. The Duke
of Ormond and Lord Bolingbroke, who had retired to
France, finding them&s;elves condemned unheard, and at|tainted,
engaged in the &s;ervice of the Chevalier, and corre&s;|ponded
with the Tories of England.</P>
<P>&sect; XXI. All the&s;e intrigues and machinations were di&s;|covered
and communicated to the court of London by the
Earl of Stair, who then re&s;ided as Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador at
Paris. He was a nobleman of unque&s;tioned honour and in|tegrity,
generous, humane, di&s;cerning, and re&s;olute. He
had &s;ignalized him&s;elf by his valour, intrepidity, and other
military talents, during the war in the Netherlands; and he
now acted in another &s;phere with uncommon vigour, vigi|lance,
and addre&s;s. He detected the Chevalier's &s;cheme
while it was yet in embryo, and gave &s;uch early notice
of it as enabled the King of Great-Britain to take effectual
mea&s;ures for defeating the de&s;ign. All the Pretender's in|tere&s;t
in France expired with Louis XIV. that o&s;tentatious
tyrant, who had for above half a century &s;acrificed the re|po&s;e
of Chri&s;tendom to his in&s;atiate vanity and ambition.
At his death, which happened on the fir&s;t day of Septem|ber,
the regency of the kingdom devolved to the Duke
of Orleans, who adopted a new &s;y&s;tem of politicks, and
had already entered into engagements with the King of
Great-Britain. In&s;tead of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Pretender, he
$mu&s;ed his agents with my&s;terious and equivocal expre&s;&s;i|ons,
calculated to fru&s;trate the de&s;ign of the expedition.
Neverthele&s;s, the more violent part of the Jacobites in
Great-Britain believed he was at bottom a friend to their
$au&s;e and depended upon him for &s;uccour. They even
$$torted from him a &s;um of money by dint of importunities,
$$d &s;ome arms: but the ve&s;&s;el was &s;hipwrecked, and the
$rgo lo&s;t upon the coa&s;t of Scotland.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="304">
&sect; XXII. The parti&s;ans of the Pretender had proceeded
too far to retreat with &s;afety; and, therefore, re&s;olved to
try their fortune in the field. The Earl of Mar repaired
to the Highlands, where he held con&s;ultations with the
Marqui&s;&s;es of Huntley and Tullibardine, the Earls Ma|ri&s;chal
and Southe&s;k, the Generals Hamilton and Cor|don,
with the chiefs of the Jacobite clans. Then he
a&s;&s;embled three hundred of his own va&s;&s;als; proclaimed
the Pretender at Ca&s;tletown, and &s;et up his &s;tandard at
Brae-Mar, on the &s;ixth day of September. By this time
the Earls of Home, Wigtoun, and Kinnoul, Lord De&s;k|ford,
and Lockhart of Carnwath, with other per&s;ons &s;u&s;|pected
of di&s;affection to the pre&s;ent government, were
committed pri&s;oners to the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh; and Ma|jor-General
Whetham marched with the regular troops
which were in that kingdom to &s;ecure the bridge at Stir|ling.
Before the&s;e precautions were taken, two ve&s;&s;els
had arrived at Arbroath from Havre, with arms, ammu|nition,
and a great number of officers, who a&s;&s;ured the
Earl of Mar, that the Pretender would &s;oon be with them
in per&s;on. The death of Louis XIV. &s;truck a general
damp upon their &s;pirits; but they laid their account with
being joined by a powerful body in England. The Earl
of Mar, by letters and me&s;&s;ages, pre&s;&s;ed the Chevalier to
come over without further delay. He, in the mean time,
a&s;&s;umed the title of lieutenant-general of the Pretender's
forces, and publi&s;hed a declaration, exhorting the people
to take arms for their lawful &s;overeign. This was fol|lowed
by a &s;hrewd manife&s;to, explaining the national
grievances, and a&s;&s;uring the people of redre&s;s. Some of
his parti&s;ans attempted to &s;urpri&s;e the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh;
but were prevented by the vigilance and activity of Colonel
Stuart, lieutenant-governor of that fortre&s;s. The Duke
of Argyle &s;et out for Scotland as commander in chief of
the forces in North-Britain: the Earl of Sutherland &s;et
fail in the Queenborough &s;hip of war for the North, where
he propo&s;ed to rai&s;e his va&s;&s;als for the &s;ervice of govern|ment&punc;
and many other Scotti&s;h peers returned to their
<PB N="299" REF="305">
own country, in order to &s;ignalize their loyalty to King
George.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIII. In England the practices of the Jacobites did
not e&s;cape the notice of the mini&s;try. Lieutenant-Colonel
Paul was impri&s;oned in the Gate-hou&s;e, for inli&s;ting men
in the &s;ervice of the Pretender. The titular Duke of Powis
was committed to the Tower: Lords Land&s;down and Du|plin
were taken into cu&s;tody; and a warrant was i&s;&s;ued for
apprehending the Earl of Jer&s;ey. The King de&s;ired the
con&s;ent of the Lower Hou&s;e to &s;ei&s;e and detain Sir Wil|liam
Wyndham, Sir John Packington, Mr. Edward Har|vey,
of Combe, Mr. Thomas For&s;ter, Mr. John An&s;tis,
and Mr. Corbet Kyna&s;ton, who were members of the
Hou&s;e, and &s;u&s;pected of favouring the inva&s;ion. The
Commons unanimou&s;ly agreed to the propo&s;al, and pre|&s;ented
an addre&s;s, &s;ignifying their approbation. Harvey
and An&s;tis were immediately &s;ecured. For&s;ter, with the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome popi&s;h lords, a&s;&s;embled a body of men
in Northumberland: Sir John Packington being examined
before the council, was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed for want of evidence:
Mr. Kyna&s;ton ab&s;conded: Sir William Wyndham was
&s;ei&s;ed at his own hou&s;e in Somer&s;et&s;hire, by Colonel Hu&s;ke
and a me&s;&s;enger, who &s;ecured his papers: he found means,
however, to e&s;cape from them; but afterward &s;urrendered
him&s;elf, and, having been examined at the council-board,
was committed to the Tower. His father-in-law, the Duke
of Somer&s;et, offered to become bound for his appearance;
and being rejected as bail, expre&s;&s;ed his re&s;entment &s;o
warmly, that the King thought proper to remove him from
the office of ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e. On the twenty-fir&s;t day of
September, the King went to the Hou&s;e of Lords, and pa&s;&s;ed
the bills that were ready for the royal a&s;&s;ent. Then the Chan|cellor
read his Maje&s;ty's &s;peech, expre&s;&s;ing his acknowledge|ment
and &s;atisfaction in con&s;equence of the uncommon
marks of their affection he had received; and the parlia|ment
adjourned to the &s;ixth day of October.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="306">
&sect; XXIV. The friends of the hou&s;e of Stuart were vey numerous
in the we&s;tern counties, and began to make
preparations for an in&s;urrection. They had concealed
&s;ome arms and artillery at Bath, and formed a de&s;ign to
&s;urpri&s;e Bri&s;tol; but they were betrayed and di&s;covered by
the emi&s;&s;aries of the government; which baffled all their
&s;chemes, and apprehended every per&s;on of con&s;equence
&s;u&s;pected of attachment to that cau&s;e. The univer&s;ity of
Oxford felt the rod of power on this occa&s;ion. Major-General
Pepper, with a &s;trong detachment of dragoons,
took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the city at day break, declaring he would
u&s;e military execution on all &s;tudents who &s;hould pre&s;ume
to appear without the limits of their re&s;pective colleges.
He &s;ei&s;ed ten or eleven per&s;ons, among whom was one
Lloyd, a coffeeman; and made prize of &s;ome hor&s;es and
furniture belonging to Colonel Owen, and other gentle|men.
With this booty he retreated to Abingdon; and
Handa&s;yde's regiment of foot was afterwards quartered
in Oxford, to overawe the univer&s;ity. The mini&s;try
found it more difficult to &s;uppre&s;s the in&s;urgents in the
northern counties. In the month of October the Earl of
Derwentwater and Mr. For&s;ter took the field with a body
of hor&s;e, and being joined by &s;ome gentlemen from the
borders of Scotland, proclaimed the Pretender in Wark|worth,
Morpeth, and Alnwick. Their fir&s;t de&s;ign was
to &s;ei&s;e the town of Newca&s;tle, in which they had many
friends: but they found the gates &s;hut upon them, and
retired to Hexham; while General Carpenter having
a&s;&s;embled a body of dragoons, re&s;olved to march from
Newca&s;tle, and attack them before they &s;hould be re-en|forced.
The rebels retiring northward to Wooler, were
joined by two hundred Scotti&s;h hor&s;e under the Lord Vi&s;|count
Kenmuir, and the Earls of Carnwath and Win|toun,
who had &s;et up the Pretender's &s;tandard at Mo&s;&s;at,
and proclaimed him in different parts of Scotland. The
rebels thus re-enforced advanced to Kel&s;o, having received
advice that they would be joined by Mackinto&s;h, who had
cor&s;&s;ed the Forth with a body of Highlanders.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="307">
&sect; XXV. By this time the Earl of Mar was at the head
of ten thou&s;and men well armed. He had &s;ecured the pa&s;s
of the Tay at Perth, where his head-quarters were e&s;ta|bli&s;hed,
and made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the whole fruitful pro|vince
of Fife, and all the &s;ea-coa&s;t on that &s;ide of the frith
of Edinburgh. He &s;elected two thou&s;and five hundred
men, commanded by Brigadier Mackinto&s;h, to make a
de&s;cent upon the Lothian &s;ide, and join the Jacobites in
that county, or &s;uch as &s;hould take arms on the borders
of England. Boats were a&s;&s;embled for this purpo&s;e; and,
notwith&s;tanding all the precautions that could be taken
by the King's &s;hips in the frith, to prevent the de&s;ign,
above fifteen hundred cho&s;en men made good their pa&s;&s;age
in the night, and landed on the coa&s;t of Lothian, having
cro&s;&s;ed an arm of the &s;ea about &s;ixteen miles broad, in open
boats that pa&s;&s;ed through the mid&s;t of the King's crui&s;ers.
Nothing could be better concerted, or executed with more
conduct and courage, than was this hazardous enterpri&s;e.
They amu&s;ed the King's &s;hips with marches and counter|marches
along the coa&s;t, in &s;uch a manner that they
could not po&s;&s;ibly know where they intended to embark.
The Earl of Mar, in the mean time, marched from Perth to
Dumblaine, as if he had intended to cro&s;s the Forth at
Stirling-bridge: but his real de&s;ign was to divert the Duke
of Argyle from attacking his detachment which had land|ed
in Lothian. So far the &s;cheme &s;ucceeded. The Duke,
who had a&s;&s;embled &s;ome troops in Lothian, returned to
Stirling with the utmo&s;t expedition, after having &s;ecured
Edinburgh, and obliged Mackinto&s;h to abandon his de&s;ign
on that city. This parti&s;an had actually taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of Leith, from whence he retired to Seaton-hou&s;e, near
Pre&s;ton-Pans, which he fortified in &s;uch a manner that he
could not be forced without artillery. Here he remained
until he received an order acro&s;s the Frith from the Earl
of Mar, to join Lord Kenmuir and the Engli&s;h at Kel&s;o,
for which place he immediately began his march, and
reached it on the twenty-&s;econd day of October, though a
good number of his men had de&s;erted on the route.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="308">
&sect; XXVI. The Lord Kenmuir, with the Earls of Win|toun,
Nith&s;dale, and Carnwath; the Earl of Derwent|water
and Mr. For&s;ter, with the Engli&s;h in&s;urgents,
arriving at the &s;ame time, a council of war was immediate|ly
called. Wintoun propo&s;ed that they &s;hould march im|mediately
into the we&s;tern parts of Scotland, and join
General Gordon, who commanded a &s;trong body of
Highlanders in Argyle&s;hire. The Engli&s;h in&s;i&s;ted upon
cro&s;&s;ing the Tweed, and attacking General Carpenter,
who&s;e troops did not exceed nine hundred dragoons.
Neither &s;cheme was executed. They took the route to
Jedburgh, where they re&s;olved to leave Carpenter on one
&s;ide, and penetrate into England by the we&s;tern border.
The Highlanders declared they would not quit their own
country; but were ready to execute the &s;cheme propo&s;ed
by the Earl of Wintoun. Means, however, were found to
prevail upon one half of them to advance, while the re&s;t
returned to the Highlands. At Brampton, For&s;ter opened
his commi&s;&s;ion of general, which had been &s;ent to him from
the Earl of Mar, and proclaimed the Pretender. They
continued their march to Penrith, where the &s;heriff, a&s;&s;i&s;ted
by the Lord Lon&s;dale and the Bi&s;hop of Carli&s;le, had
a&s;&s;embled the whole po&s;&s;e-comitatus of Cumberland,
amounting to twelve thou&s;and men, who di&s;per&s;ed with the
utmo&s;t precipitation at the approach of the rebels. From
Penrith, For&s;ter proceeded by the way of Kendal and
Lanca&s;ter to Pre&s;ton, from whence Stanhope's regiment
of dragoons, and another of militia, immediately retired;
&s;o that he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the place without re&s;i&s;tance.
General Willis marched again&s;t the enemy with &s;ix regi|ments
of hor&s;e and dragoons, and one battalion of foot com|manded
by Colonel Pre&s;ton. They had advanced to the
bridge of Ribble before For&s;ter received intelligence of
their approach. He forthwith began to rai&s;e barricadoes,
and put the place in a po&s;ture of defence. On the twelfth day
of November, the town was bri&s;kly attacked in two differ|ent
places; but the King's troops met with a very warm
reception, and were repul&s;ed with con&s;iderable lo&s;s. Next
<PB N="303" REF="309">
day General Carpenter arrived with a re-enforcement of
three regiments of dragoons; and the rebels were inve&s;ted
on all &s;ides. The Highlanders declared they would make
a &s;ally &s;word in hand, and either cut their way through
the King's troops, or peri&s;h in the attempt; but they were
over-ruled. For&s;ter &s;ent Colonel Oxburgh with a trum|pet,
to General Willis, to propo&s;e a capitulation. He
was given to under&s;tand, that the General would not treat
with rebels; but in ca&s;e of their &s;urrendering at di&s;cretion
he would prevent his &s;oldiers from putting them to the
&s;word, until he &s;hould receive further orders. He granted
them time to con&s;ider till next morning, upon their deliver|ing
the Earl of Derwentwater and Mackinto&s;h as ho&s;|tages.
When For&s;ter &s;ubmitted, this Highlander declared
he could not promi&s;e that the Scots would &s;urrender in that
manner. The general de&s;ired him to return to his people,
and he would forthwith attack the town, in which ca&s;e every
man of them &s;hould be cut in pieces. The Scotti&s;h noble|men
did not choo&s;e to run that ri&s;que; and per&s;uaded the
Highlanders to accept the terms that were offered. They
accordingly laid down their arms, and were put under a
&s;trong guard. All the noblemen and leaders were &s;ecured.
Major Nairn, Captain Lockhart, Captain Shaftoe, and
En&s;ign Er&s;kine, were tried by a court-martial as de&s;erters,
and executed. Lord Charles Murray, &s;on of the Duke
of Athol, was likewi&s;e condemned for the &s;ame crime,
but reprieved. The common men were impri&s;oned at
Che&s;ter and Liverpool; the noblemen and con&s;iderable
officers were &s;ent to London, conveyed through the &s;treets
pinioned like malefactors, and committed to the Tower and
to Newgate.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVII. The day on which the rebels &s;urrendered at
Pre&s;ton was remarkable for the battle of Dumblaine,
fought between the Duke of Argyle and the Earl of Man,
who commanded the Pretender's forces. This nobleman
had retreated to his camp at Perth, when he under&s;tood
the Duke was returned from Lothian to Stirling. But
being now joined by the northern clans under the Earl of
<PB N="304" REF="310">
Seaforth, and tho&s;e of the we&s;t commanded by General
Gordon, who had &s;ignalized him&s;elf in the &s;ervice of the
Czar of Mu&s;covy, he re&s;olved to pa&s;s the Forth, in order
to join his &s;outhern friends, that they might march to|gether
into England. With this view he advanced to
Auchterarder, where he reviewed his army, and re&s;ted on
the eleventh day of November. The Duke of Argyle, ap|pri&s;ed
of his intention, and being joined by &s;ome regiments
of dragoons from Ireland, determined to give him battle in
the neighbourhood of Dumblaine. On the twelfth day of
the month, Argyle pa&s;&s;ed the Forth at Stirling, and en|camped
with his left at the village of Dumblaine, and his
right towards Sheriff-moor. The Earl of Mar advanced
within two miles of his camp, and remained till day-break in
order of battle; his army con&s;i&s;ting of nine thou&s;and effect|ive
men, cavalry as well as infantry. In the morning, the
Duke, under&s;tanding they were in motion, drew up his
forces, which did not exceed three thou&s;and five hundred
men, on the heights to the north-ea&s;t of Dumblaine; but he
was outflanked both on the right and left. The clans that
formed part of the centre and right wing of the enemy,
with Glengary and Clanronald at their head, charged the
left of the King's army &s;word in hand, with &s;uch impetuo|&s;ity,
that in &s;even minutes both hor&s;e and foot were totally
routed with great &s;laughter; and General Whetham, who
commanded them, fled at full gallop to Stirling, where
he declared that the royal army was totally defeated. In
the mean time, the Duke of Argyle, who commanded
in per&s;on on the right, attacked the left of the enemy, at
the head of Stair's and Evans's dragoons, and drove them
two miles before him, as far as the water of Allan: yet
in that &s;pace they wheeled about, and attempted to rally ten
times; &s;o that he was obliged to pre&s;s them hard, that
they might not recover from their confu&s;ion. Brigadier
Wightman followed, in order to &s;u&s;tain him with three
battalions of infantry; while the victorious right wing of
the rebels having pur&s;ued Whetham a con&s;iderable way,
returned to the field, and formed in the rear of Wight|man,
<PB N="305" REF="311">
to the amount of five thou&s;and men. The Duke of
Argyle, returning from the pur&s;uit, joined Wightman,
who had faced about, and taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome en|clo&s;ures
and mud-walls, in expectation of being attacked.
In this po&s;ture both armies fronted each other till the
evening, when the Duke drew off towards Dumblaine, and
the rebels retired to Ardoch, without mutual mole&s;tation.
Next day, the Duke marching back to the field of battle,
carried off the wounded, with four pieces of cannon left by
the enemy, and retreated to Stirling. Few pri&s;oners were
taken on either &s;ide: the number of the &s;lain might be
about five hundred of each army; and both generals
claimed the victory. This battle was not &s;o fatal to the
Highlanders as the lo&s;s of Inverne&s;s, from which Sir John
Mackenzie was driven by Simon Frazer Lord Lovat, who,
contrary to the principles he had hitherto profe&s;&s;ed, &s;ecured
this important po&s;t for the government; by which means
a free communication was opened with the north of Scot|land,
where the Earl of Sutherland had rai&s;ed a con&s;ider|able
body of va&s;&s;als. The Marquis of Huntley and the
Earl of Seaforth were obliged to quit the rebel army, in
order to defend their own territories; and in a little time
&s;ubmitted to King George: a good number of the Frazers
declared with their chiefs again&s;t the Pretender: the Mar|quis
of Tullibardine withdrew from the army, to cover his
own country; and the clans, &s;eeing no likelihood of another
action, began to di&s;per&s;e, according to cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVIII. The government was now in a condition to
&s;end &s;trong re-enforcements to Scotland. Six thou&s;and
men that were claimed of the States-General, by virtue of
the treaty, landed in England, and began their march for
Edinburgh: General Cadogan &s;et out for the &s;ame place,
together with Brigadier Petit, and &s;ix other engineers; and
a train of artillery was &s;hipped at the Tower for that coun|try,
the Duke of Argyle re&s;olving to drive the Earl of
Mar out of Perth, to which town he had retired with the
remains of his forces. The Pretender having been amu&s;ed
with the hope of &s;eeing the whole kingdom of England
<PB N="306" REF="312">
ri&s;e up as one man in his behalf; and the Duke of Or|mond
having made a fruitle&s;s voyage to the we&s;tern coa&s;t,
to try the di&s;po&s;ition of the people, he was now convinced
of the vanity of his expectation in that quarter; and, as
he knew not what other cour&s;e to take, he re&s;olved to
hazard his per&s;on among his friends in Scotland, at a
time when his affairs in that kingdom were ab&s;olutely
de&s;perate. From Bretagne he po&s;ted through part of
France, in di&s;gui&s;e, and embarking in a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el at
Dunkirk, hired for that purpo&s;e, arrived on the twenty-&s;econd
day of December at Peterhead, with &s;ix gentlemen
in his retinue, one of whom was the Marquis of Tin|mouth,
&s;on to the Duke of Berwick. He pa&s;&s;ed through
Aberdeen incognito, to Fettero&s;&s;e, where he was met by
the Earls of Mar and Mari&s;chal, and about thirty noble|men
and gentlemen of the fir&s;t quality. Here he was
&s;olemnly proclaimed: his declaration, dated at Commercy,
was printed and circulated through all the parts in that
neighbourhood; and he received addre&s;&s;es from the epi&s;|copal
clergy, and the laity of that communion in the dio|ce&s;e
of Aberdeen. On the fifth day of January, he made
his publick entry into Dundee; and on the &s;eventh arrived
at Scone, where he &s;eemed determined to &s;tay until the
ceremony of his coronation &s;hould be performed. From
thence he made an excur&s;ion to Perth, where he reviewed
his forces. Then he formed a regular council; and pub|li&s;hed
&s;ix proclamations; one for a general thank&s;giving,
on account of his &s;afe arrival; another enjoining the mini|&s;ters
to pray for him in churches; a third e&s;tabli&s;hing the
currency of foreign coins; a fourth &s;ummoning the meet|ing
of the convention of e&s;tates; a fifth ordering all &s;en&s;i|ble
men to repair to his &s;tandard; and a &s;ixth, fixing the
twenty-third day of January for his coronation. He made
a pathetick &s;peech in a grand council, at which all the
chiefs of his party a&s;&s;i&s;ted. They determined, however,
to abandon the enterpri&s;e, as the King's army was re-en|forced
by the Dutch auxiliaries, and they them&s;elves were
not only reduced to a &s;mall number, but likewi&s;e de&s;titute
<PB N="307" REF="313">
of money, arms, ammunition, forage, and provi&s;ion; for
the Duke of Argyle had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Burnet-i&s;land,
and tran&s;ported a detachment to Fife, &s;o as to cut off Mar's
communication with that fertile country.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIX. Notwith&s;tanding the &s;everity of the weather,
and a prodigious fall of &s;now, which rendered the roads
almo&s;t impa&s;&s;able, the Duke, on the twenty-ninth of
January, began his march to Dumblaine, and next day
reached Tullibardine, where he received intelligence that
the Pretender and his forces had, on the preceding day
retired towards Dundee. He forthwith took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
Perth; and then began his march to Aberbrothick, in
pur&s;uit of the enemy. The Chevalier de St. George,
being thus hotly pur&s;ued, was prevailed upon to embark
on board a &s;mall French &s;hip that lay in the harbour of
Montro&s;e. He was accompanied by the Earls of Mar
and Melfort, the Lord Drummond, Lieutenant-General
Bulkley, and other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, to the number
of &s;eventeen. In order to avoid the Engli&s;h crui&s;ers, they
&s;tretched over to Norway, and coa&s;ting along the German
and Dutch &s;hores, arrived in five days at Graveline. Ge|neral
Gordon, whom the Pretender had left commander
in chief of the forces, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Earl Mari&s;chal, pro|ceeded
with them to Aberdeen, where he &s;ecured three
ve&s;&s;els to &s;ail northward, and take on board the per&s;ons
who intended to make their e&s;cape to the continent. Then
they continued their march through Strath&s;pey and Strath|down,
to the hills of Badenoch, where the common
people were quietly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. This retreat was made
with &s;uch expedition, that the Duke of Argyle, with all
his activity, could never overtake their rear-guard, which
con&s;i&s;ted of a thou&s;and hor&s;e, commanded by the Earl Ma|ri&s;chal.
Such was the i&s;&s;ue of a rebellion that proved
fatal to many noble families: a rebellion which, in all
probability, would never have happened, had not the vio|lent
mea&s;ures of a Whig mini&s;try kindled &s;uch a flame of
di&s;content in the nation, as encouraged the parti&s;ans of the
Pretender to hazard a revolt.</P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="314">
&sect; XXX. The parliament of Ireland, which met at Dub|lin
on the twelfth day of November, &s;eemed even more
zealous, if po&s;&s;ible, than that of England, for the pre&s;ent
admini&s;tration. They pa&s;&s;ed bills for recogni&s;ing the
King's title; for the &s;ecurity of his per&s;on and govern|ment;
for &s;etting a price on the Pretender's head; and for
attainting the Duke of Ormond. They granted the &s;up|plies
without oppo&s;ition. All tho&s;e who had addre&s;&s;ed the
$ate Queen in favour of Sir Con&s;tantine Phipps, then lord
chancellor of Ireland, were now brought upon their
knees, and cen&s;ured as guilty of a breach of privilege.
They de&s;ired the lords-ju&s;tices would i&s;&s;ue a proclamation
again&s;t the popi&s;h inhabitants of Limerick and Galway,
who, pre&s;uming upon the capitulation &s;igned by King
William, claimed an exemption from the penalties im|po&s;ed
upon other papi&s;ts. They engaged in an a&s;&s;ociation
again&s;t the Pretender, and all his abettors. They voted the
Earl of Angle&s;ey an enemy to the King and kingdom, be|cau&s;e
he advi&s;ed the Queen to break the army, and pro|rogue
the late parliament; and they addre&s;&s;ed the King
to remove him from his council and &s;ervice. The lords-ju&s;tices
granted orders for apprehending the Earls of An|trim
and We&s;tmeath, the Lords Natterville, Cahir, and Dil|lon,
as per&s;ons &s;u&s;pected of di&s;affection to the government.
Then they adjourned the two Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXI. The King, in his &s;peech to the Engli&s;h par|liament,
which met on the ninth of January, told them
he had rea&s;on to believe the Pretender was landed in Scot|land:
he congratulated them on the &s;ucce&s;s of his arms in
&s;uppre&s;&s;ing the rebellion: on the conclu&s;ion of the barrier
treaty between the Emperor and the States-General, under
his guarantee; on a convention with Spain that would
deliver the trade of England to that kingdom from the
new impo&s;itions and hard&s;hips to which it was &s;ubjected
in con&s;equence of the late treaties. He likewi&s;e gave them
to under&s;tand, that a treaty for renewing all former alli|ances
between the crown of Great-Britain and the States-General
was almo&s;t concluded; and he a&s;&s;ured the Com|mons
<PB N="309" REF="315">
he would freely give up all the e&s;tates that &s;hould
become forfeited to the crown by this rebellion, to be ap|plied
towards defraying the extraordinary expen&s;e in|curred
on this occa&s;ion. The Commons, in their addre&s;s
of thanks, declared that they would pro&s;ecute, in the mo&s;t
vigorous and impartial manner, the authors of tho&s;e de|&s;tructive
councils which had drawn down &s;uch mi&s;eries
upon the nation. Their re&s;olutions were &s;peedy, and
exactly conformable to this declaration. They expelled
Mr. For&s;ter from the Hou&s;e. They forthwith impeached
the Earls of Derwentwater, Nith&s;dale, Carnwath, and
Wintoun; Lords Widdrington, Kenmuir, and Nairn.
The&s;e noblemen being brought to the bar of the Hou&s;e of
Lords, heard the articles of impeachment read on the
tenth day of January, and were ordered to put in their
an&s;wers on the &s;ixteenth. The impeachments being
lodged, the Lower Hou&s;e ordered a bill to be brought in
for continuing the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the Habeas Corpus act:
then they prepared another to attaint the Marquis of Tul|libardine,
the Earls of Mar and Linlithgow, and Lord
John Drummond. On the twenty-fir&s;t day of January,
the King gave the royal a&s;&s;ent to the bill for continuing
the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the Habeas Corpus act. He told the
parliament that the Pretender was actually in Scotland,
heading the rebellion, and a&s;&s;uming the &s;tyle and title of
king of the&s;e realms: he demanded of the Commons
&s;uch &s;upply as might di&s;courage any foreign power from
a&s;&s;i&s;ting the rebels. On Thur&s;day the nineteenth day of
January, all the impeached lords pleaded guilty to the
articles exhibited again&s;t them, except the Earl of Win|toun,
who petitioned for a longer time, on various pre|tences.
The re&s;t received &s;entence of death on the ninth
day of February, in the court erected in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall,
where the Lord-Chancellor Cowper pre&s;ided as lord
high-&s;teward on that occa&s;ion. The Counte&s;s of Nith&s;|dale
and Lady Nairn threw them&s;elves at the King's
feet, as he pa&s;&s;ed through the appartments of the palace,
and implored his mercy in behalf of their hu&s;bands, but
<PB N="310" REF="316">
their tears and entreaties produced no effect. The council
re&s;olved that the &s;entence &s;hould be executed, and orders
were given for that purpo&s;e to the Lieutenant of the
Tower, and the Sheriffs of London and Middle&s;ex.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXII. The Counte&s;s of Derwentwater, with her
&s;i&s;ter, accompanied by the Duche&s;&s;es of Cleveland and
Bolton, and &s;everal other ladies of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction,
was introduced by the Dukes of Richmond and St. Al|ban's
into the King's bed-chamber, where &s;he invoked
his Maje&s;ty's clemency for her unfortunate con&s;ort. She
afterwards repaired to the lobby of the Hou&s;e of Peers.
attended by the ladies of the other condemned lords, and
above twenty others of the &s;ame quality, and begged the
interce&s;&s;ion of the Hou&s;e: but no regard was paid to their
petition. Next day, they petitioned both Hou&s;es of par|liament.
The Commons rejected their &s;uit. In the Up|per
Hou&s;e, the Duke of Richmond delivered a petition
from the Earl of Derwentwater, to whom he was nearly
related, at the &s;ame time declaring that he him&s;elf &s;hould
oppo&s;e his &s;ollicitation. The Earl of Derby expre&s;&s;ed
&s;ome compa&s;&s;ion for the numerous family of Lord Nairn.
Petitions from the re&s;t were pre&s;ented by other lords,
moved with pity and humanity. Lord Town&s;hend and
others vehemently oppo&s;ed their being read. The Earl of
Nottingham thought this indulgence might be granted:
the Hou&s;e a&s;&s;ented to his opinion; and agreed to an ad|dre&s;s,
praying his Maje&s;ty would reprieve &s;uch of the
condemned lords as &s;hould &s;eem to de&s;erve his mercy. To
this petition the King an&s;wered, That on this and all other
occa&s;ions he would do what he thought mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent
with the dignity of his crown and the &s;afety of his peo|ple.
The Earl of Nottingham, pre&s;ident of the council,
his brother the Earl of Ayle&s;bury, chancellor of the duchy
of Lanca&s;ter, his &s;on Lord Finch, one of the lords of the
Trea&s;ury, his kin&s;man Lord Guern&s;ey, ma&s;ter of the jewel-office,
were altogether di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice.
Orders were di&s;patched for executing the Earls of Der|wentwater
and Nith&s;dale, and the Vi&s;count of Kenmuir.
<PB N="311" REF="317">
immediately: the others were re&s;pited to the &s;eventh day
of March. Nith&s;dale made his e&s;cape in women's apparel,
furni&s;hed and conveyed to him by his own mother. On
the twenty-fourth day of February, Derwentwater and
Kenmuir were beheaded on Tower-Hill. The former was
an amiable youth, brave, open, generous, ho&s;pitable, and
humane. His fate drew tears from the &s;pectators, and
was a great misfortune to the country in which he lived.
He gave bread to multitudes of people whom he employed
on his e&s;tate; the poor, the widow, and the orphan rejoiced
in his bounty. Kenmuir was a virtuous nobleman, calm,
&s;en&s;ible,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Annals.</NOTE> re&s;olute, and re&s;igned. He was a devout member
of the Engli&s;h church;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bolingbroke Patten.</NOTE> but the other died in the faith of
Rome;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deb. in Par.</NOTE> both adhered to their political principles. On the
fifteenth day of March,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tindal.</NOTE> Wintoun was brought to trial,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State Trials.</NOTE> and
being convicted received &s;entence of death.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIII. When the King pa&s;&s;ed the land-tax bill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1716.</NOTE>
which was u&s;hered in with a very extraordinary preamble,
he informed both Hou&s;es of the Pretender's flight from
Scotland. In the beginning of April, a commi&s;&s;ion for
trying the rebels met in the court of Common-Pleas, when
bills of high-trea&s;on were found again&s;t Mr. For&s;ter,
Mackinto&s;h, and twenty of their confederates. For&s;ter
e&s;caped from Newgate, and reached the continent in &s;afety:
the re&s;t pleaded Not-guilty, and were indulged with time
to prepare for their trials. The judges appointed to try
the rebels at Liverpool found a con&s;iderable number
guilty of high-trea&s;on. Two-and-twenty were executed
at Pre&s;ton and Manche&s;ter: about a thou&s;and pri&s;oners
&s;ubmitted to the King's mercy, and petitioned for tran&s;|portation.
Pitts, the keeper of Newgate, being &s;u&s;pected
of having connived at For&s;ter's e&s;cape, was tried for his
life at the Old-Bailey, and acquitted. Notwith&s;tanding
this pro&s;ecution, which ought to have redoubled the vigi|lance
of the jailors, Brigadier Mackinto&s;h, and &s;everal
other pri&s;oners, broke from Newgate, after having ma&s;tered
the keeper and turnkey, and di&s;armed the &s;entinel. The
<PB N="312" REF="318">
court proceeded with the trials of tho&s;e that remained;<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1716.</NOTE> and
a great number were found guilty; four or five were hang|ed,
drawn, and quartered, at Tyburn; and among the&s;e
was one William Paul, a clergyman, who, in his la&s;t
&s;peech, profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf a true and &s;incere member of the
church of England, but not of the revolution &s;chi&s;matical
church, who&s;e bi&s;hops had abandoned the King, and &s;hame|fully
given up their eccle&s;ia&s;tical rights, by &s;ubmitting to
the unlawful, invalid, lay-deprivations authori&s;ed by the
Prince of Orange.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIV. Though the rebellion was extingui&s;hed,
the flame of national di&s;&s;atisfaction &s;till continued to rage:
the &s;everities exerci&s;ed again&s;t the rebels increa&s;ed the
general di&s;content; for now the danger was blown over
their humane pa&s;&s;ions began to prevail. The courage
and fortitude with which the condemned per&s;ons encoun|tered
the pains of death in its mo&s;t dreadful form propo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
many &s;pectators in favour of the cau&s;e by which
tho&s;e unhappy &s;ouls were animated. In a word, per|&s;ecution,
as u&s;ual, extended the here&s;y. The mini&s;try
perceiving this univer&s;al di&s;affection, and dreading the
revolution of a new parliament, which might wre&s;t the
power from their faction, and retort upon them the vio|lence
of their own mea&s;ures, formed a re&s;olution equally
odious and effectual to e&s;tabli&s;h their admini&s;tration. This
was no other than a &s;cheme to repeal the triennial act,
and by a new law to extend the term of parliaments to
&s;even years. On the tenth day of April, the Duke of
Devon&s;hire repre&s;ented, in the Hou&s;e of Lords, that trien|nial
elections &s;erved to keep up party divi&s;ions; to rai&s;e
and foment feuds in private families; to produce ruinous
expen&s;es, and give occa&s;ion to the cabals and intrigues of
foreign princes; that it became the wi&s;dom of &s;uch an
augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly to apply proper remedies to an evil that
might be attended with the mo&s;t dangerous con&s;equences,
e&s;pecially in the pre&s;ent temper of the nation, as the &s;pi|rit
of rebellion &s;till remained unconquered. He, therefore,
propo&s;ed a bill for enlarging the continuance of parlia|ments.
<PB N="313" REF="319">
He was &s;econded by the Earls of Dor&s;et and
Rockingham,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. I. 1716.</NOTE> the Duke of Argyle, Lord Town&s;hend, and
the other chiefs of that party. The motion was oppo&s;ed
by the Earls of Nottingham, Abingdon, and Paulet.
They ob&s;erved that frequent parliaments were required
by the fundamental con&s;titution of the kingdom, a&s;cer|tained
in the practice of many ages; that the members of
the Lower Hou&s;e were cho&s;en by the body of the nation,
for a certain term of years, at the expiration of which
they could be no longer repre&s;entatives of the people, who,
by the parliament's protracting its own authority, would
be deprived of the only remedy which they have again&s;t
tho&s;e who, through ignorance or corruption, betrayed the
tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them; that the rea&s;ons in favour of &s;uch
a bill were weak and frivolous; that, with re&s;pect to foreign
alliances, no prince or &s;tate could rea&s;onably depend upon
a people to defend their liberties and intere&s;ts who &s;hould
be thought to have given up &s;o great a part of their own;
nor would it be prudent in them to wi&s;h for a change in
that con&s;titution under which Europe had of late been &s;o
powerfully &s;upported; on the contrary, they might be de|terred
from entering into any engagements with Great-Britain,
when informed by the preamble of the bill, that
the popi&s;h faction was &s;o dangerous as to threaten de|&s;truction
to the government; they would apprehend that
the admini&s;tration was &s;o weak as to want &s;o extraordinary
a provi&s;ion for its &s;afety; that the gentlemen of Britain
were not to be tru&s;ted; and that the good affections of the
people were re&s;trained within the limits of the Hou&s;e of
Commons. They affirmed that this bill, far from pre|venting
the expen&s;e of elections, would rather increa&s;e it,
and encourage every &s;pecies of corruption; for the value
of a &s;eat would always be in proportion to the duration of
a parliament; and the purcha&s;e would ri&s;e accordingly;
that a long parliament would yield a greater temptation,
as well as a better opportunity to a vicious mini&s;try, to
corrupt the members, than they could po&s;&s;ibly have when
the parliaments were &s;hort and frequent; that the &s;ame
<PB N="314" REF="320">
rea&s;ons urged for pa&s;&s;ing the bill to continue this parliament
for &s;even years would be at lea&s;t as &s;trong, and, by the con|duct
of the mini&s;try, might be made much &s;tronger before
the end of that term, for continuing, and even perpetuating
their legi&s;lative power, to the ab&s;olute &s;ubver&s;ion of the third
e&s;tate of the realm. The&s;e arguments &s;erved only to form
a decent debate, after which the bill for &s;eptennial parlia|ments
pa&s;&s;ed by a great majority; though twenty peers en|tered
a prote&s;t. It met with the &s;ame fate in the Lower
Hou&s;e, where many &s;trong objections were &s;tarted to no
purpo&s;e. They were repre&s;ented as the effects of party
&s;pleen; and, indeed, this was the great &s;pring of action on
both &s;ides. The que&s;tion for the bill was carried in the
affirmative; and in a little time it received the royal &s;anc|tion.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXV. The rebellion being utterly quelled, and
all the &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons of con&s;equence detained in &s;afe
cu&s;tody, the King re&s;olved to vi&s;it his German dominions,
where he fore&s;aw a &s;torm gathering from the quarter of
Sweden. Charles XII. was extremely exa&s;perated again&s;t
the Elector of Hanover, for having entered into the con|federacy
again&s;t him in his ab&s;ence, particularly for his
having purcha&s;ed the duchies of Bremen and Verden,
which con&s;tituted part of his dominions; and he breathed
nothing but revenge again&s;t the King of Great-Britain.
It was with a view to avert this danger or prepare again&s;t
it, that the King now determined upon a voyage to the
continent. But as he was re&s;tricted from leaving his
Briti&s;h dominions, by the act for the further limitation of
the crown, this clau&s;e was repealed in a new bill that
pa&s;&s;ed through both Hou&s;es without the lea&s;t difficulty.
On the twenty-&s;ixth day of June, the King clo&s;ed the
&s;e&s;&s;ion with a &s;peech upon the u&s;ual topicks, in which,
however, he ob&s;erved that the numerous in&s;tances of mercy
he had &s;hown &s;erved only to encourage the faction of the
Pretender, who&s;e parti&s;ans acted with &s;uch in&s;olence and
folly, as if they intended to convince the world that they
were not to be reclaimed by gentle methods. He in|timated
<PB N="315" REF="321">
his purpo&s;e of vi&s;iting his dominions in Germany;
and gave them to under&s;tand, that he had con&s;tituted his
beloved &s;on, the Prince of Wales, guardian of the kingdom
in his ab&s;ence. About this period, General Macartney,
who had returned to England at the acce&s;&s;ion of King
George, pre&s;ented him&s;elf to trial for the murther of the
Duke of Hamilton. The depo&s;ition of Colonel Hamil|ton
was contradicted by two park-keepers: the General
was acquuitted of the charge, re&s;tored to his rank in the
army, and gratified with the command of a regiment.
The King's brother, Prince Erne&s;t, Bi&s;hop of O&s;nabruck,
was created Duke of York and Albany, and Earl of Ul|&s;ter.
The Duke of Argyle, and his brother the Earl of
Ilay, to whom his Maje&s;ty owed, in a great mea&s;ure, his
peaceable acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, as well as the extinction
of the rebellion in Scotland, were now di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from all
their employments. General Carpenter &s;ucceeded the
Duke in the chief command of the forces in North-Britain,
and in the government of Port-Mahon; and the Duke of
Montro&s;e was appointed lord-regi&s;ter of Scotland, in the
room of the Earl of Ilay.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVI. On the &s;eventh day of July, the King em|barked
at Grave&s;end, landed on the ninth in Holland,
through which he pa&s;&s;ed incognito to Hanover, and from
thence &s;et out for Pyrmont. His aim was to &s;ecure his
German dominions from the Swede, and Great-Britain
from the Pretender. The&s;e two princes had already be|gun
to form a de&s;ign, in conjunction, of invading his
kingdom. He knew the Duke of Orleans was re&s;olved to
a&s;cend the throne of France, in ca&s;e the young King, who
was a &s;ickly child, &s;hould die without male i&s;&s;ue. The
Regent was not ignorant that Philip of Spain would
powerfully conte&s;t that &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, notwith&s;tanding his
renunciation; and he was glad of an opportunity to
&s;trengthen his intere&s;t by an alliance with the maritime
powers of England and Holland. The King of England
$ounded him on this &s;ubject, and $ound him eager to en|gage
in &s;uch an a&s;&s;ociation. The negociation was carried
<PB N="316" REF="322">
on by General Cadogan for England, the Abb&eacute; du Bois for
France, and the Pen&s;ionary Hein&s;ius for the States-General.
The Regent readily compiled with all their demands. He
engaged that the Pretender &s;hould immediately depart from
Avignon to the other &s;ide of the Alps, and never return
to Lorraine or France on any pretence what&s;oever: that no
rebellious &s;ubjects of Great-Britain &s;hould be allowed to re|&s;ide
in that kingdom: and that the treaty of Utrecht, with
re&s;pect to the demolition of Dunkirk, &s;hould be fully exe|cuted
to the &s;atisfaction of his Britannick Maje&s;ty. The
treaty contained a mutual guarantee of all the places po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed
by the contracting powers; of the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
on the throne of England, as well as that of the Duke of
Orleans to the crown of France; and a defen&s;ive alliance,
&s;tipulating the proportion of &s;hips and forces to be fur|ni&s;hed
to that power which &s;hould be di&s;turbed at home
or invaded from abroad. The Engli&s;h people murmured
at this treaty. They &s;aid an unnece&s;&s;ary umbrage was
given to Spain, with which the nation had great com|mercial
connexions; and that, on pretence of an inva&s;ion,
a body of foreign troops might be introduced to en&s;lave the
kingdom.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVII. His Maje&s;ty was not &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful in his
endeavours to appea&s;e the King of Sweden, who refu&s;ed
to li&s;ten to any overtures until Bremen and Verden &s;hould
be re&s;tored. The&s;e the Elector of Hanover re&s;olved to
keep as a fair purcha&s;e; and he engaged in a confederacy
with the enemies of Charles, for the maintenance of this
acqui&s;ition. Mean while his rupture with Sweden was
extremely prejudicial to the commerce of England, and
had well nigh entailed upon the kingdom another inva&s;ion,
much more formidable than that which had &s;o lately mi&s;|carried.
The mini&s;ters of Sweden re&s;ident at London,
Paris, and the Hague maintained a corre&s;pondence with
the di&s;affected &s;ubjects of Great-Britain. A &s;cheme was
formed for the Swedi&s;h King's landing on this i&s;land with a
con&s;iderable body of forces, where he &s;hould be joined by
<PB N="317" REF="323">
the malcontents of the united kingdom. Charles reli&s;hed
the enterpri&s;e, which flattered his ambition and revenge:
nor was it di&s;agreeable to the Czar of Mu&s;covy, who re|&s;ented
the Elector's offer of joining the Swede again&s;t the
Ru&s;&s;ians, provided he would ratify the ce&s;&s;ion of Bremen
and Verden. King George having received intimation of
the&s;e intrigues, returned to England towards the end of
January; and ordered a detachment of foot-guards to &s;ecure
Count Gyllenburg, the Swedi&s;h mini&s;ter, with all his papers.
At the &s;ame time, Sir Jacob Bancks and Mr. Charles
Cae&s;ar were apprehended. The other foreign mini&s;ters
took the alarm, and remon&s;trated to the mini&s;try upon this
outrage committed again&s;t the law of nations. The two
Secretaries, Stanhope and Methuen, wrote circular letters
to them, a&s;&s;uring them that in a day or two they &s;hould
be acquainted with the rea&s;ons that induced the King to
take &s;uch an extraordinary &s;tep. They were generally
&s;atisfied with this intimation; but the Marquis de Monte|leone,
amba&s;&s;ador from Spain, expre&s;&s;ed his concern, that
no other way could be found to pre&s;erve the peace of the
kingdom, without arre&s;ting the per&s;on of a publick mini|&s;ter,
and &s;ei&s;ing all his papers, which were the &s;acred re|po&s;itories
of his ma&s;ter's &s;ecrets: he ob&s;erved, that in
whatever manner the&s;e two facts might &s;eem to be under|&s;tood,
they very &s;en&s;ibly wounded the law of nations.
About the &s;ame time the Baron Gortz, the Swedi&s;h re&s;iden|tiary
in Holland, was &s;ei&s;ed with his papers at Arnheim, at
the de&s;ire of King George, communicated to the States by
Mr. Leathes, his mini&s;ter at the Hague. The Baron owned
he had projected the inva&s;ion, a de&s;ign that was ju&s;tified
by the conduct of King George, who had joined the
princes in confederacy again&s;t the King of Sweden, with|out
having received the lea&s;t provocation; who had a&s;&s;i&s;t|ted
the King of Denmark in &s;ubduing the duchies of
Bremen and Verden, and then purcha&s;ed them of the
u&s;urper; and who had, in the cour&s;e of this very &s;ummer,
&s;ent a &s;trong &s;quadron of &s;hips to the Baltick, where it
joined the Danes and Ru&s;&s;ians again&s;t the Swedi&s;h fleet.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="324">
&sect; XXXVIII. When the parliament of Great-Britain
met on the twentieth day of February, the King informed
them of the triple alliance he had concluded with France
and Holland. He mentioned the projected inva&s;ion; told
them he had given orders for laying before them copies
of the letters which had pa&s;&s;ed between the Swedi&s;h mini|&s;ters
on that &s;ubject; and he demanded of the Commons
&s;uch &s;upplies as &s;hould be found nece&s;&s;ary for the defence
of the kingdom. By tho&s;e papers it appeared that the
&s;cheme projected by Baron Gortz was very plau&s;ible, and
even ripe for execution; which, however, was po&s;tponed
until the army &s;hould be reduced, and the Dutch aux|iliaries
&s;ent back to their own country. The letters being
read in parliament, both Hou&s;es pre&s;ented addre&s;&s;es, in
which they extolled the King's prudence in e&s;tabli&s;hing
&s;uch conventions with foreign potentates as might repair
the gro&s;s defects, and prevent the pernicious con&s;equences
of the treaty of Utrecht, which they termed a treacherous
and di&s;honourable peace: and they expre&s;&s;ed their horrour
and indignation at the malice and ingratitude of tho&s;e
who had encouraged an inva&s;ion of their country. He
likewi&s;e received an addre&s;s of the &s;ame kind from the con|vocation;
another from the di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ters; a third
from the univer&s;ity of Cambridge; but Oxford was not
&s;o lavi&s;h of her compliments. At a meeting of the Vice-Chancellor
and heads of that univer&s;ity, a motion was made
for an addre&s;s to the King, on the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the late
unnatural rebellion; his Maje&s;ty's &s;afe return; and the
favour lately &s;hown to the univer&s;ity, in omitting, at their
reque&s;t, the ceremony of burning in effigy the devil, the
Pope, the Pretender, the Duke of Ormond, and the Earl
of Mar, on the anniver&s;ary of his Maje&s;ty's acce&s;&s;ion.
Dr. Smalridge, Bi&s;hop of Bri&s;tol, ob&s;erved, that the
rebellion had been long &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; that there would be
no end to addre&s;&s;es, &s;hould one be pre&s;ented every time
his Maje&s;ty returned from his German dominions: that
the late favour they had received was overbalanced by
a whole regiment now quartered upon them; and that
<PB N="319" REF="325">
there was no precedent in addre&s;&s;ing a King upon his
return from his German dominions. The univer&s;ity
thought they had rea&s;on to complain of the little regard
paid to their remon&s;trance, touching a riot rai&s;ed in that
city by the &s;oldiers there quartered, on pretence that the
anniver&s;ary of the Prince's birth-day had not been cele|brated
with the u&s;ual rejoicings. Affidavits had been &s;ent
up to the council, which &s;eemed to favour the officers of
the regiment. When the Hou&s;e of Lords deliberated upon
the mutiny-bill, by which the &s;oldiers were exempted
from arre&s;ts for debts, complaint was made of their li|centious
behaviour at Oxford; and a motion was made,
that they &s;hould enquire into the riot. The Lords pre|&s;ented
an addre&s;s to the Queen, de&s;iring that the papers
relating to that affair might be laid before the Hou&s;e.
The&s;e being peru&s;ed, were found to be recriminations be|tween
the Oxonians and the officers of the regiment. A
warm debate en&s;ued, during which the Earl of Abingdon
offered a petition from the Vice-Chancellor of the univer|&s;ity,
the mayor and magi&s;trates of Oxford, praying to be
heard. One of the court-members ob&s;erving that it would
be irregular to receive a petition while the Hou&s;e was in a
grand committee, a motion was made, that the chairman
&s;hould leave the chair; but this was carried in the ne|gative,
the debate was re&s;umed, and the majority agreed
to the following re&s;olutions: That the heads of the uni|ver&s;ity,
and mayor of the city, neglected to make publick
rejoicings on the Prince's birth-day: That the officers
having met to celebrate that day, the hou&s;e in which they
had a&s;&s;embled was a&s;&s;aulted, and the windows were broken
by the rabble: That this a&s;&s;ault was the beginning and
occa&s;ion of the riots that en&s;ued: That the conduct of
the major &s;eemed well ju&s;tified by the affidavits produced
on his part: That the printing and publi&s;hing the depo|&s;itions,
upon which the complaints relating to the riots at
Oxford were founded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Annals. State $rials. Deb. in Par. Tindal Voltaire.</NOTE> while that matter was under the
$xamination of the lords of the committee of the council,

<PB N="320" REF="326">
touching the &s;ame, was irregular, di&s;re&s;pectful to his Royal
Highne&s;s, and tending to &s;edition. An enquiry of this
nature, &s;o managed, did not much redound to the honour
of &s;uch an augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIX. The Commons pa&s;&s;ed a bill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1717.</NOTE> prohibiting
all commerce with Sweden, a branch of trade which was
of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to the Engli&s;h merchants.
They voted ten thou&s;and &s;eamen for the en&s;uing year;
granted about a million for the maintenance of guards, gar|ri&s;ons,
and land-forces; and pa&s;&s;ed the bill relating to
mutiny and de&s;ertion. The Hou&s;e likewi&s;e voted four-and-twenty
thou&s;and pounds for the payment of four bat|talions
of Mun&s;ter and two of Saxe-Gotha, which the King
had taken into his &s;ervice, to &s;upply the place of &s;uch as
might be, during the rebellion, drawn from the garri&s;ons
of the States-General to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of England. This
vote, however, was not carried without a violent debate&punc;
The demand was inveighed again&s;t as an impo&s;ition, &s;ee|ing
no troops had ever &s;erved. A motion was made for
an addre&s;s, de&s;iring that the in&s;tructions of tho&s;e who
concluded the treaties might be laid before the Hou&s;e:
but this was over-ruled by the majority<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">This year was rendered famous by a complete victory which Prince Eugene obtained over the Turks at Peterwaradin upon the Danube. The battle was fought on the fifth day of Augu&s;t. The Imperial army did not exceed &s;ixty thou&s;and men: that of the Infidels amounted to one hun|dred and fifty thou&s;and, commanded by the Grand Vi&s;i$, who was mor|tally wounded in the engagement. The Infidels were totally defeated, with the lo&s;s of all their tents, artillery, and baggage; &s;o that the victors obtained an immen&s;e booty.</NOTE> The &s;upplies
was rai&s;ed by a land-tax of three &s;hillings in the pound,
and a malt-tax. What the Commons had given was not
thought &s;ufficient for the expen&s;e of the year; therefore,
Mr. Secretary Stanhope brought a me&s;&s;age from his Ma|je&s;ty,
demanding an extraordinary &s;upply, that he might
be the better enabled to &s;ecure his kingdoms again&s;t the
danger with which they were threatened from Sweden;
and he moved that a &s;upply &s;hould be granted to his Ma|je&s;ty
for this purpo&s;e. Mr. Shippen ob&s;erved it was a
<PB N="321" REF="327">
great misfortune that the King was as little acquainted
with the parliamentary proceedings as with the lan|guage
of the country:<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. I. 1717.</NOTE> that the me&s;&s;age was unparlia|mentary
and unprecedented; and, in his opinion, penned
by &s;ome foreign mini&s;ter: he &s;aid he had been often
told that his Maje&s;ty had retrieved the honour and re|putation
of the nation; a truth which appeared in the
flouri&s;hing condition of trade; but, that the &s;upply de|manded
&s;eemed to be incon&s;i&s;tent with the glorious advan|tages
which his Maje&s;ty had obtained for the people. He
was &s;econded by Mr. Hungerford, who declared that for
his part he could not under&s;tand what occa&s;ion there was
for new alliances; much le&s;s that they &s;hould be pur|cha&s;ed
with money. He expre&s;&s;ed his &s;urpri&s;e that a na|tion
&s;o lately the terror of France and Spain &s;hould now
&s;eem to fear &s;o incon&s;iderable an enemy as the King of
Sweden. The motion was &s;upported by Mr. Bo&s;cawen,
Sir Gilbert Heathcote, and others: but &s;ome of the Whigs
&s;poke again&s;t it; and Mr. Robert Walpole was &s;ilent.
The Speaker, and Mr. Smith, one of the tellers of the
Exchequer, oppo&s;ed this unparliamentary way of demand|ing
the &s;upply: the former propo&s;ed that part of the
army &s;hould be di&s;banded, and the money applied towards
the making good &s;uch new engagements as were deemed
nece&s;&s;ary. After &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive debates, the re&s;olution
for a &s;upply was carried by a majority of four voices.</P>
<P>&sect; XL. The mini&s;try was now divided within it&s;elf.
Lord Town&s;hend had been removed from the office of &s;e|cretary
of &s;tate, by the intrigues of the Earl of Sunder|land;
and he was now likewi&s;e di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the place
of lord-lieutenant of Ireland. Mr. Robert Walpole re|&s;igned
his po&s;ts of fir&s;t commi&s;&s;ioner of the Trea&s;ury and
chancellor of the Exchequer: his example was followed
by Mr. Pulteney, &s;ecretary at war, and Mr. Methuen, &s;e|cretary
of &s;tate. When the affair of the &s;upply was re|&s;umed
in the Hou&s;e of Commons, Mr. Stanhope made a
motion for granting two hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds
for that purpo&s;e. Mr. Pulteney ob&s;erved, that having
<PB N="322" REF="328">
re&s;igned his place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1717.</NOTE> he might now act with the freedom
becoming an Engli&s;hman: he declared again&s;t the manner
of granting the &s;upply, as unparliamentary and unprece|dented.
He &s;aid he could not per&s;uade him&s;elf that any
Engli&s;hman advi&s;ed his Maje&s;ty to &s;end &s;uch a me&s;&s;age;
but he doubted not the re&s;olution of a Briti&s;h parliament
would make a German mini&s;try tremble. Mr. Stanhope
having harangued the Hou&s;e in vindication of the mini&s;try,
Mr. Smith an&s;wered every article of his &s;peech: he affirmed
that if an e&s;timate of the conduct of the mini&s;try in re|lation
to affairs abroad was to be made from a compari&s;on
of their conduct at home, they would not appear altogether
&s;o faultle&s;s as they were repre&s;ented. &startq;Was it not a
mi&s;take (&s;aid he) not to pre&s;erve the peace at home,
after the King had a&s;cended the throne with the uni|ver&s;al
applau&s;e and joyful acclamations of all his &s;ub|jects?
Was it not a mi&s;take, upon the breaking out of
the rebellion, not to i&s;&s;ue a proclamation, to offer par|don
to &s;uch as &s;hould return home peaceably, according
to the cu&s;tom on former occa&s;ions of the &s;ame nature?
Was it not a mi&s;take, after the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the rebel|lion,
and the trial and execution of the principal au|thors
of it, to keep up animo&s;ities, and drive people to
de&s;pair, by not pa&s;&s;ing an act of indemnity; by keeping
&s;o many per&s;ons under hard and tedious con&s;inement;
and by granting pardons to &s;ome, without leaving them
any means to &s;ub&s;i&s;t? Is it not a mi&s;take, not to tru&s;t
to a vote of parliament, for making good &s;uch engage|ments
as his Maje&s;ty &s;hould think proper to enter into;
and in&s;tead of that, to in&s;i&s;t on the granting this &s;upply
in &s;uch an extraordinary manner? Is it not a mi&s;take, to
take this opportunity to create divi&s;ions, and render
&s;ome of the King's be&s;t friends &s;u&s;pected and obnoxious?
Is it not a mi&s;take, in &s;hort, to form parites and cabals,
in order to bring in a bill to repeal the act of occa&s;ional
conformity?&endq; A great number of members had agreed
to this mea&s;ure in private, though at this period it was
not brought into the Hou&s;e of Commons. After a long
<PB N="323" REF="329">
debate the &s;um was granted. The&s;e were the fir&s;t-fruits
of Britain's being wedded to the intere&s;ts of the continent.
The Elector of Hanover quarrelled with the King of
Sweden; and England was not only deprived of a nece&s;|&s;ary
branch of commerce, but even obliged to &s;upport
him in the pro&s;ecution of the war. The mini&s;try now
underwent a new revolution. The Earl of Sunderland
and Mr. Addi&s;on were appointed &s;ecretaries of &s;tate: Mr.
Stanhope became fir&s;t commi&s;&s;ioner of the Trea&s;ury, and
chancellor of the Exchequer.</P>
<P>&sect; XLI. On the &s;ixth day of May, the King, going to
the Hou&s;e of Peers, gave the parliament to under&s;tand,
that the fleet under Sir George Byng, which had &s;ailed to
the Baltick, to ob&s;erve the motions of the Swedes, was
&s;afely arrived in the Sound. He &s;aid he had given orders
for the immediate reduction of ten thou&s;and &s;oldiers, as
well as directions to prepare an act of indemnity. He de|&s;ired
they would take proper mea&s;ures for reducing the
publick debts with a ju&s;t regard to parliamentary credit;
and that they would go through the public bu&s;ine&s;s with
all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch and unanimity. Some progre&s;s had
already been made in deliberations upon the debt of the
nation, which was comprehended under the two heads of
redeemable and irredeemable incumbrances. The fir&s;t
had been contracted with a redeemable intere&s;t; and the&s;e
the publick had a right to di&s;charge: the others con|&s;i&s;ted
of long and &s;hort annuities granted for a greater or
le&s;s number of years, which could not be altered without
the con&s;ent of the proprietors. Mr. Robert Walpole had
projected a &s;cheme for le&s;&s;ening the intere&s;t, and paying
the capital of tho&s;e debts, before he re&s;igned his place in
the Exchequer. He propo&s;ed, in the Hou&s;e of Commons,
to reduce the intere&s;t of redeemable funds, and offer an al|ternative
to the proprietors of annuities. His plan was
approved; but, when he re&s;igned his places, the mini&s;ters
made &s;ome &s;mall alterations in it, which furni&s;hed him with
a preten&s;e for oppo&s;ing the execution of the &s;cheme. In
the cour&s;e of the debate, &s;ome warm altercation pa&s;&s;ed
<PB N="324" REF="330">
between him and Mr. Stanhope, by which it appeared,
they had made a practice of &s;elling places and rever&s;ions.
Mr. Hungerford, &s;tanding up, &s;aid he was &s;orry to &s;ee two
&s;uch great men running foul of one another: that, how|ever,
they ought to be looked upon as patriots and fathers
of their country; and &s;ince they had by mi&s;chance di&s;|covered
their nakedne&s;s, the other members ought, accord|ing
to the cu&s;tom of the Ea&s;t, to turn their backs upon
them, that they might not be &s;een in &s;uch a &s;hameful
condition. Mr. Bo&s;cawen moved that the Hou&s;e would
lay their commands upon them, that no further notice
&s;hould be taken of what had pa&s;&s;ed. He was &s;econded by
Mr. Methuen: the Hou&s;e approved of the motion; and
the Speaker took their word and honour that they &s;hould
not pro&s;ecute their re&s;entment. The money-corporations
having agreed to provide ca&s;h for &s;uch creditors as &s;hould
be willing to receive their principal, the Hou&s;e came to
certain re&s;olutions, on which were founded the three bills
that pa&s;&s;ed into laws, under the names of &startq;The South-Sea
act, the Bank act, and the General-fund act.&endq; The
original &s;tock of the South-Sea company did not exceed
nine millions four hundred and &s;eventy-one thou&s;and three
hundred and twenty-five pounds; but the funds granted
being &s;ufficient to an&s;wer the intere&s;t of ten millions at
&s;ix per cent. the company made up that &s;um to the govern|ment,
for which they received &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds
yearly, and eight thou&s;and pounds a-year for management.
By this act they declared them&s;elves willing to receive five
hundred thou&s;and pounds, and the eight thou&s;and for ma|nagement.
It was enacted, That the company &s;hould con|tinue
a corporation, until the redemption of their annuity,
towards which not le&s;s than a million &s;hould be paid at a
time. They were likewi&s;e required to advance a &s;um not
exceeding two millions, towards di&s;charging the principal
and intere&s;t due on the four lottery funds of the ninth
and tenth years of Queen Anne. By the Bank act the
governors and company declared them&s;elves willing to
accept an annuity of eighty-eight thou&s;and &s;even hundred
<PB N="325" REF="331">
and fifty-one pounds, &s;even &s;hillings, and ten pence half|penny,
or the principal of one million &s;even hundred and
&s;eventy-five thou&s;and twenty-&s;even pounds, &s;eventeen &s;hil|lings,
and ten pence halfpenny, in lieu of the pre&s;ent
annuity, amounting to one hundred and &s;ix thou&s;and five
hundred and one pounds, thirteen &s;hillings, and five pence.
They likewi&s;e declared them&s;elves willing to di&s;charge,
and deliver up to be cancelled, as many Exchequer-bills
as amounted to two millions, and to accept of an annuity
of one hundred thou&s;and pounds, being after the rate of
five per cent. redeemable after one year's notice; to cir|culate
the remaining Exchequer-bills at three per cent.
and one penny per day. It was enacted, That the former
allowances &s;hould be continued to Chri&s;tmas, and then
the Bank &s;hould have for circulating the two millions five
hundred and &s;ixty-one thou&s;and and twenty-five pounds
remaining Exchequer bills, an annuity of &s;eventy-&s;ix
thou&s;and eight hundred and thirty pounds, fifteen &s;hillings,
at the rate of three pounds per cent. till redeemed, over
and above the one penny a-day for intere&s;t. By the &s;ame
act the Bank was required to advance a &s;um not exceed|ing
two millions five hundred thou&s;and pounds, towards
di&s;charging the national debt, if wanted, on condition
that they &s;hould have five pounds per cent. for as much
as they might advance, redeemable by parliament. The
General-fund act recited the &s;everal acts of parliament, for
e&s;tabli&s;hing the four lotteries in the ninth and tenth years
of the late Queen, and &s;lated the annual produce of the
&s;everal funds, amounting in all to &s;even hundred twenty-four
thou&s;and eight hundred forty-nine pounds, &s;ix &s;hil|lings,
and ten pence one fifth. This was the General-fund;
the deficiency of which was to be made good an|nually,
out of the fir&s;t aids granted by parliament. For
the regular payment of all &s;uch annuities as &s;hould be
made payable by this act, it was enacted, That all the
duties and revenues mentioned therein &s;hould continue
for ever, with the provi&s;o, however, that the revenues
rendered by this act perpetual &s;hould be &s;ubject to
<PB N="326" REF="332">
redemption. This act contained a clau&s;e by which the
&s;inking fund was e&s;tabli&s;hed. The reduction of intere&s;t
to five per cent. producing a &s;urplus or exce&s;s upon the
appropriated funds, it was enacted, That all the monies
ari&s;ing from time to time, as well for the &s;urplus, by virtue
of the acts for redeeming the funds of the Bank and of the
South-Sea company, as al&s;o for the &s;urplus of the duties
and revenues by this act appropriated to make good the
General-fund, &s;hould be appropriated and employed for
the di&s;charging the principal and intere&s;t of &s;uch national
debt as was incurred before the twenty-fifth of December
of the preceding year, in &s;uch manner as &s;hould be directed
or appointed by any future act of parliament, to be di&s;|charged
out of the &s;ame, and for none other u&s;e, intent, or
purpo&s;e what&s;oever.</P>
<P>&sect; XLII. The Earl of Oxford, who had now remained
almo&s;t two years a pri&s;oner in the Tower, pre&s;ented a peti|tion
to the Hou&s;e of Lords, praying that his impri&s;onment
might not be indefinite. Some of the Tory lords affirmed
that the impeachment was de&s;troyed and determined
by the prorogation of parliament, which &s;uper&s;eded the
whole proceedings; but the contrary was voted by a con|&s;iderable
majority. The thirteenth day of June was fixed
for the trial; and the Hou&s;e of Commons made acquainted
with this determination. The Commons appointed a
committee to enquire into the &s;tate of the Earl's impeach|ment;
and, in con&s;equence of their report, &s;ent a me&s;&s;age
to the Lords, demanding longer time to prepare for the trial.
Accordingly, the day was prolonged to the twenty-fourth
of June; and the Commons appointed the committee,
with four other members, to be the managers for making
good the articles of impeachment. At the appointed time,
the Peers repaired to the court in We&s;tmini&s;ter-hall, where
Lord Cowper pre&s;ided as lord-&s;teward. The Commons
were a&s;&s;embled as a committee of the whole Hou&s;e: the
King, the re&s;t of the royal family, and the foreign mini|&s;ters,
a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the &s;olemnity: the Earl of Oxford was
brought from the Tower: the articles of impeachment
<PB N="327" REF="333">
were read, with his an&s;wers, and the replication of the
Commons. Sir Jo&s;eph Jekyll &s;tanding up to make good
the fir&s;t article, Lord Harcourt &s;ignified to their lord&s;hips
that he had a motion to make, and they adjourned to their
own hou&s;e. There he repre&s;ented, that a great deal of
time would be unnece&s;&s;arily con&s;umed in going through
all the articles of the impeachment: that if the Commons
would make good the two articles for high-trea&s;on, the
Earl of Oxford would forfeit both life and e&s;tate, and
there would be an end of the matter: whereas, to proceed
on the method propo&s;ed by the Commons would draw the
trial on to a prodigious length. He, therefore, moved that
the Commons might not be permitted to proceed, until
judgment &s;hould be fir&s;t given upon the articles for high-trea&s;on.
He was &s;upported by the Earls of Angle&s;ey and
Nottingham, the Lord Trevor, and a con&s;iderable number
of both parties; and though oppo&s;ed by the Earl of Sun|derland,
the Lords Coning&s;by and Parker, the motion
was carried in the affirmative. It produced a di&s;pute be|tween
the two Hou&s;es. The Commons, at a conference,
delivered a paper, containing their rea&s;ons for a&s;&s;erting it
as their undoubted right to impeach a peer either for trea&s;on
or for high crimes and mi&s;demeanours; or, &s;hould they &s;ee
occa&s;ion, to mix both in the &s;ame accu&s;ation. The
Hou&s;e of Lords in&s;i&s;ted on their former re&s;olution; and
in another conference delivered a paper, wherein they
a&s;&s;erted it to be a right inherent in every court of ju&s;tice
to order and direct &s;uch methods of proceedings as it &s;hould
think &s;it to be ob&s;erved in all cau&s;es that fall under its
cognizance. The Commons demanded a free conference,
which was refu&s;ed. The di&s;pute grew more and more
warm. The Lords &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the Lower Hou&s;e,
importing, that they intended pre&s;ently to proceed on the
trial of the Earl of Oxford. The Commons paid no
regard to this intimation; but adjourned to the third day
of July. The Lords, repairing to We&s;tmini&s;ter-hall, took
their places, ordered the Earl to be brought to the bar,
and made proclamation for his accu&s;ers to appear. Having
<PB N="328" REF="334">
waited a quarter of an hour, they adjourned to their own
hou&s;e, where, after &s;ome debate, the Earl was acquitted
upon a divi&s;ion: then returning to the hall, they voted,
That he &s;hould be &s;et at liberty. Oxford owned his &s;afety
to the di&s;&s;entions among the mini&s;ters, and to the late
change in the admini&s;tration. In con&s;equence of this, he
was delivered from the per&s;ecution of Walpole; and
numbered among his friends the Dukes of Devon&s;hire and
Argyle, the Earls of Nottingham and Ilay, and Lord
Town&s;hend. The Commons, in order to expre&s;s their
&s;en&s;e of his demerit, pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the King,
de&s;iring he might be excepted out of the intended act of
grace. The King promi&s;ed to comply with their reque&s;t;
and in the mean time forbade the Earl to appear at court.
On the fifteenth day of July the Earl of Sunderland de|livered
in the Hou&s;e of Peers the act of grace, which pa&s;&s;ed
through both Hou&s;es with great expedition. From this
indulgence were excepted the Earl of Oxford, Mr. Prior,
Mr. Thomas Harley, Mr. Arthur Moore; Cri&s;p, Nodes,
Obryan, Redmayne the printer, and Thomp&s;on; as al&s;o
the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inators in Newgate, and the clan of Mackgregor
in Scotland. By virtue of this act, the Earl of Carn|wath,
the Lords Widdrington and Nairn were imme|diately
di&s;charged; together with all the gentlemen under
&s;entence of death in Newgate, and tho&s;e that were con|fined
on account of the rebellion in the Fleet, the Mar&s;hal|&s;ea,
and other pri&s;ons of the kingdom. The act of grace
being prepared for the royal a&s;&s;ent, the King went to the
Hou&s;e of Peers on the fifteenth day of July, and having
given his &s;anction to all the bills that were ready, clo&s;ed the
&s;e&s;&s;ion with a &s;peech on the u&s;ual topicks.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIII. The proceedings in the Convocation turned
chiefly upon two performances of Dr. Hoadley, Bi&s;hop of
Bangor. One was intituled, &startq;A Pre&s;ervative again&s;t
the Principles and Practices of the Nonjurors:&endq;
the other was a &s;ermon preached before the King, under
the title of, &startq;The nature of the kingdom of Chri&s;t.&endq;
An an&s;wer to this di&s;cour&s;e was publi&s;hed by Dr. Snape,
<PB N="329" REF="335">
ma&s;ter of Eton college, and the convocation appointed a
committee to examine the Bi&s;hop's two performances.
They drew up a repre&s;entation, in which the Pre&s;ervative
and the &s;ermon were cen&s;ured, as tending to &s;ubvert all
government and di&s;cipline in the church of Chri&s;t; to
reduce his kingdom to a &s;tate of anarchy and confu&s;ion;
to impugn and impeach the royal &s;upremacy in cau&s;es ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical,
and the authority of the legi&s;lature to enforce
obedience in matters of religion by civil &s;anctions. The
government thought proper to put a &s;top to the&s;e proceed|ings
by a prorogation; which, however, inflamed the
controver&s;y. A great number of pens were drawn again&s;t
the Bi&s;hop: but his chief antagoni&s;ts were Dr. Snape and
Dr. Sherlock, whom the King removed from the office
of his chaplains; and the Convocation has not been per|mitted
to &s;it and do bu&s;ine&s;s &s;ince that period.</P>

&sect; I. DURING the&s;e tran&s;actions, the negociations
of the North were continued again&s;t the King
of Sweden, who had penetrated into Norway, and ad|vanced
towards Chri&s;tian&s;tadt, the capital of that king|dom.
The Czar had &s;ent five-and-twenty thou&s;and
Ru&s;&s;ians to a&s;&s;i&s;t the allies in the reduction of Wi&s;mar,
which he intended to be&s;tow upon his niece, lately married
to the Duke of Mecklenburg Schwerin: but, before his troops
arrived, the place had &s;urrendered, and the Ru&s;&s;ians were
not admitted into the garri&s;on; a circum&s;tance which in|crea&s;ed
the mi&s;under&s;tanding between him and the King
of Great-Britain. Neverthele&s;s, he con&s;ented to a project
for making a de&s;cent upon Schonen, and actually took
upon him the command of the allied fleet; though he
was not at all plea&s;ed to &s;ee Sir John Norris in the Baltick,
becau&s;e he had formed de&s;igns again&s;t Denmark, which
he knew the Engli&s;h &s;quadron would protect. He &s;uddenly
de&s;i&s;ted from the expedition again&s;t Schonen, on pretence
that the &s;ea&s;on was too far advanced; and the King of
Denmark publi&s;hed a manife&s;to, remon&s;trating again&s;t his
conduct on this occa&s;ion. By this time Baron Gortz
had planned a pacification between his ma&s;ter and the
Czar, who was di&s;contented with all his German allies,
becau&s;e they oppo&s;ed his having any footing in the empire.
This monarch arrived at Am&s;terdam in December,
whither he was followed by the Czarina; and he actually
re&s;ided at the Hague when King George pa&s;&s;ed through it,
in return to his Briti&s;h dominions: but he declined an
interview with the King of England. When Gyllen|burg's
letters were publi&s;hed in London, &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages
&s;eemed to favour the &s;uppo&s;ition of the Czar's being
privy to the con&s;piracy. His mini&s;ter at the Engli&s;h court
pre&s;ented a long memorial, complaining that the King
had cau&s;ed to be printed the malicious in&s;inuations of his
enemies. He denied his having the lea&s;t concern in the
de&s;ign of the Swedi&s;h King. He charged the court of
England with having privately treated of a &s;eparate peace
with Charles, and even with having promi&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t him
<PB N="332" REF="338">
again&s;t the Czar, on condition that he would relinqui&s;h his
preten&s;ions to Bremen and Verden. Neverthele&s;s, he ex|pre&s;&s;ed
an inclination to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the ancient good under|&s;tanding,
and to engage in vigorous mea&s;ures for pro&s;ecu|ting
the war again&s;t the common enemy. The memorial
was an&s;wered by the King of Great-Britain, who a&s;&s;ured
the Czar he &s;hould have rea&s;on to be fully &s;atisfied, if he
would remove the only ob&s;tacle to their mutual good under|&s;tanding;
in other words, withdraw the Ru&s;&s;ian troops
from the empire. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e profe&s;&s;ions, the
two monarchs were never perfectly reconciled.</P>
<P>&sect; II. The Czar made an excur&s;ion to the court of
France, where he concluded a treaty of friend&s;hip with the
regent, at who&s;e earne&s;t de&s;ire he promi&s;ed to recall his
troops from Mecklenburgh. At his return to Am&s;terdam,
he had a private interview with Gortz, who, as well as
Gyllenburg, had been &s;et at liberty. Gortz under|took
to adju&s;t all differences between the Czar and the
King of Sweden within three months; and Peter engaged
to &s;u&s;pend all operations again&s;t Sweden, until that term
&s;hould be expired. A congre&s;s was opened at Abo,
between the Swedi&s;h and Ru&s;&s;ian mini&s;ter; but the con|ferences
were afterwards removed to Aland. By this
convention, the Czar obliged him&s;elf to a&s;&s;i&s;t Charles in
the conque&s;t of Norway; and they promi&s;ed to unite all
their forces again&s;t the King of Great-Britain, &s;hould he
pre&s;ume to interpo&s;e. Both were incen&s;ed again&s;t that
prince; and one part of their de&s;ign was to rai&s;e the Pre|tender
to the throne of England. Baron Gortz &s;et out
from Aland for Frederick&s;tadt in Norway, with the plan
of peace; but, before he arrived, Charles was killed by a
cannon-ball from the town, as he vi&s;ited the trenches, on
the thirteenth of November. Baron Gortz was immediately
arre&s;ted, and brought to the &s;caffold by the nobles of
Sweden, who&s;e hatred he had incurred by his in&s;olence of
behaviour. The death of Charles was fortunate for King
George. Sweden was now obliged to &s;ubmit: while the
<PB N="333" REF="339">
Czar, the King of Denmark, and the Elector of Hanover,
kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what they had acquired in the cour&s;e of
the war.</P>
<P>&sect; III. Thus Bremen and Verden were &s;ecured to the
hou&s;e of Hanover; an acqui&s;ition towards which the
Engli&s;h nation contributed by her money, as well as by
her arms; an acqui&s;ition made in contradiction to the en|gagements
into which England entered when King Wil|liam
became guarantee for the treaty of Travendahl; an
acqui&s;ition that may be con&s;idered as the fir&s;t link of a
political chain by which the Engli&s;h nation was dragged
back into expen&s;ive connexions with the continent. The
King had not yet received the inve&s;titure of the duchies;
and, until that &s;hould be procured, it was nece&s;&s;ary to
e&s;pou&s;e with warmth the intere&s;ts of the Emperor. This
was another &s;ource of mi&s;under&s;tanding between Great-Britain
and Spain. Prince Eugene gained another complete
victory over a prodigious army of the Turks at Belgrade,
which was &s;urrendered to him after the battle. The Em|peror
had engaged in this war as an ally of the Venetians,
whom the Turks had attacked, and driven from the Morea.
The Pope con&s;idered it as a religious war again&s;t the In|fidels;
and obtained repeated a&s;&s;urances from the King
of Spain, that he would not undertake any thing again&s;t
the Emperor, while he was engaged in &s;uch a laudable
quarrel. Philip had even &s;ent a &s;quadron of &s;hips and gal|lies
to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Venetians. In the cour&s;e of this
year, however, he equipped a &s;trong armament, the com|mand
of which he be&s;towed on the Marquis de Lede,
who &s;ailed from Barcelona in July, and landing at Cag|$iari
in Sardinia, which belonged to the Emperor, made a
conque&s;t of the whole i&s;land. At the &s;ame time, the King
of Spain endeavoured to ju&s;tify the&s;e proceedings by a ma|nife&s;to,
in which he alledged that the Archduke, con|trary
to the faith of treaties, encouraged and &s;upported
$he rebellion of his &s;ubjects in Catalonia, by frequent
$uccours from Naples, and other places; and that the
Great Inqui&s;itor of Spain had been &s;ei&s;ed, though fur|ni&s;hed
<PB N="334" REF="340">
with a pa&s;&s;port from his Holine&s;s. He promi&s;ed
however, to proceed no farther, and &s;u&s;pend all operations,
that the powers of Europe might have time and opportu|nity
to contrive expedients for reconciling all differences,
and &s;ecuring the peace and balance of power in Italy;
nay, he con&s;ented that this important affair &s;hould be left
to the arbitration of King George and the States-General.
The&s;e powers undertook the office. Conferences were be|gun
between the mini&s;ters of the Emperor, France, Eng|land,
and Holland; and the&s;e produced, in the cour&s;e of
the following year, the famous quadruple alliance. In this
treaty it was &s;tipulated, that the Emperor &s;hould re|nounce
all preten&s;ions to the crown of Spain, and ex|change
Sardinia for Sicily, with the Duke of Savoy; that
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the duchies of Tu&s;cany, Parma, and Pla|centia,
which the Queen of Spain claimed by inheritance,
as Prince&s;s of the hou&s;e of Farne&s;e, &s;hould be &s;ettled on
her elde&s;t &s;on, in ca&s;e the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors &s;hould die
without male i&s;&s;ue. Philip, di&s;&s;atisfied with this partition,
continued to make formidable preparations by &s;ea and land.
The King of England and the Regent of France interpo&s;ed
their admonitions to no purpo&s;e. At length his Britannick
Maje&s;ty had recour&s;e to more &s;ub&s;tantial arguments, and
ordered a &s;trong &s;quadron to be equipped with all po&s;&s;ible
expedition<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The Pretender, who re&s;ided at Urbino, having received intelligence from Paris, that there was a de&s;ign formed again&s;t his life, Pope Clement XI. gave directions that all foreigners in that neighbourhood, e&s;pecially Engli&s;h, &s;hould be arre&s;ted. The Earl of Peterborough arriving at Bologna, with a few armed followers, was &s;ei&s;ed, with all his papers. Being interrogated, he &s;aid he came to pa&s;s &s;ome time in Italy, for the benefit of the air. He was clo&s;e confined for a whole month in Fort Urbino, and his attendants were &s;ent to pri&s;on. Nothing appearing to ju&s;tify the &s;u&s;picion, he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with uncommon civility. The King demanding reparation for this in&s;ult, the Pope wrote with his own hand a letter to an ally of Great-Bri|tain, declaring that the Legate of Bologna had violently and unju&s;tly, with|out the knowledge of his Holine&s;s, cau&s;ed the Earl of Peterborough to be &s;ei&s;ed upon &s;u&s;picions which proved to be ill-grounded. The Cardinal-Legate &s;ent a declaration to the Engli&s;h admiral in the Mediterranea$, that he had a&s;ked forgivene&s;s of his Holine&s;s, and now begged pardon of his Britannick Maje&s;ty, for having unadvi&s;edly arre&s;ted a peer of Great Britain on his travels.</NOTE>.</P>

&sect; IV. On the third day of November, the Prince&s;s of
Wales was delivered of a prince, the ceremony of who&s;e
bapti&s;m was productive of a difference between the grand|father
and the father. The Prince of Wales intended
that his uncle, the Duke of York, &s;hould &s;tand godfather.
The King ordered the Duke of Newca&s;tle to &s;tand for
him&s;elf. After the ceremony, the Prince expre&s;&s;ed his re|&s;entment
again&s;t this nobleman in very warm terms. The
King ordered the Prince to confine him&s;elf within his own
apartments; and afterwards &s;ignified his plea&s;ure that he
&s;hould quit the palace of St. James's. He retired with the
Prince&s;s to a hou&s;e belonging to the Earl of Grantham;
but the children were detained at the palace. All peers
and peere&s;&s;es, and all privy-coun&s;ellors and their wives,
were given to under&s;tand, that in ca&s;e they vi&s;ited the
Prince and Prince&s;s, they &s;hould have no acce&s;s to his
Maje&s;ty's pre&s;ence; and all who enjoyed po&s;ts and places
under both King and Prince were obliged to quit the
&s;ervice of one or other, at their option. When the par|liament
met on the twenty-fir&s;t day of November, the
King, in his &s;peech, told both Hou&s;es that he had reduced
the army to very near one half, &s;ince the beginning of the
la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion; he expre&s;&s;ed his de&s;ire that all tho&s;e who were
friends to the pre&s;ent happy e&s;tabli&s;hment might unani|mou&s;ly
concur in &s;ome proper method for the greater
&s;trengthening the prote&s;tant intere&s;t, of which, as the
church of England was unque&s;tionably the main &s;upport
$nd bulwark, &s;o would &s;he reap the principal benefit of
$very advantage accruing from the union and mutual cha|rity
of all prote&s;tants. After the addre&s;&s;es of thanks,
which were couched in the u&s;ual &s;tyle, the Commons
proceeded to take into con&s;ideration the e&s;timates and ac|counts,
in order to &s;ettle the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the army,
Navy, and Ordnance. Ten thou&s;and men were voted for
$$e &s;ea-&s;ervice. When the &s;upply for the army fell under
$eliberation, a very warm debate en&s;ued, upon the num|ber
of troops nece&s;&s;ary to be maintained. Sir William
$yndham, Mr. Shippen, and Mr. Walpole, in a long
<PB N="336" REF="342">
elaborate harangue, in&s;i&s;ted upon its being reduced to twelve
thou&s;and. They were an&s;wered by Mr. Craggs, &s;ecretary
at war, and Sir David Dalrymple. Mr. Shippen, in the
cour&s;e of the debate, &s;aid the &s;econd paragraph of the King's
&s;peech &s;eemed rather to be calculated for the meridian of
Germany than for Great-Britain; and it was a great mi&s;|fortune
that the King was a &s;tranger to our language and
con&s;titution. Mr. Lechmere affirmed this was a &s;candalous
invective again&s;t the King's per&s;on and government; and
moved that he who uttered it &s;hould be &s;ent to the Tower.
Mr. Shippen, refu&s;ing to retract or excu&s;e what he had &s;aid,
was voted to the Tower by a great majority; and the num|ber
of &s;tanding forces was fixed at &s;ixteen thou&s;and three
hundred and forty-&s;even effective men.</P>
<P>&sect; V. On account of the great &s;carcity of &s;ilver coin,
occa&s;ioned by the exportation of &s;ilver, and the importation
of gold, a motion was made to put a &s;top to this growing
evil, by lowering the value of gold &s;pecie. The Com|mons
examined a repre&s;entation which had been made to
the Trea&s;ury by Sir I&s;aac Newton, ma&s;ter of the Mint,
on this &s;ubject. Mr. Ca&s;wel explained the nature of a
clande&s;tine trade carried on by the Dutch and Ham|burghers,
in concert with the Jews of England and other
traders, for exporting the &s;ilver coin and importing gold,
which being coined at the Mint, yielded a profit of fifteen
pence upon every guinea. The Hou&s;e, in an addre&s;s to
the King, de&s;ired that a proclamation might be i&s;&s;ued,
forbidding all per&s;ons to utter or receive guineas at a higher
rate than one-and-twenty &s;hillings each. His Maje&s;ty
complied with their reque&s;t: but people hoarding up their
&s;ilver, in hopes that the price of it would be rai&s;ed, or
in apprehen&s;ion that the gold would be lowered &s;till far|ther,
the two Hou&s;es re&s;olved that the &s;tandard of the gold
and &s;ilver coins of the kingdom &s;hould not be altered in
finene&s;s, weight, or denomination; and they ordered a bill
to be brought in, to prevent the melting down of the &s;ilver
coin. At this period, one James Shepherd, a youth of
<PB N="337" REF="343">
eighteen, apprentice to a coachmaker, and an enthu&s;ia&s;t in
Jacobiti&s;m, &s;ent a letter to a nonjuring clergyman, pro|po&s;ing
a &s;cheme for a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating King George. He was
immediately apprehended, owned the de&s;ign, was tried,
condemned, and executed at Tyburn. This was likewi&s;e
the fate of the Marquis de Palleotti, an Italian nobleman,
brother to the Duche&s;s of Shrew&s;bury. He had, in a
tran&s;port of pa&s;&s;ion, killed his own &s;ervant, and &s;eemed
indeed to be di&s;ordered in his brain. After he had received
&s;entence of death, the King's pardon was earne&s;tly &s;olli|cited
by his &s;i&s;ter, the Duche&s;s, and many other per&s;ons
of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction; but the common people became
&s;o clamorous, that it was thought dangerous to re&s;cue
him from the penalties of the law, which he accordingly
underwent in the mo&s;t ignominious manner. No &s;ubject
produced &s;o much heat and altercation in parliament dur|ing
this &s;e&s;&s;ion, as did the bill for regulating the land|forces,
and puni&s;hing mutiny and de&s;ertion; a bill which
was looked upon as an encroachment upon the liberties
and con&s;titution of England, ina&s;much as it e&s;tabli&s;hed
martial law, which wre&s;ted from the civil magi&s;trate the
cognizance of crimes and mi&s;demeanours committed by the
&s;oldiers and officers of the army: a juri&s;diction incon&s;i&s;tent
with the genius and di&s;po&s;ition of the people. The dan|gers
that might accrue from &s;uch a power were explained
in the Lower Hou&s;e by Mr. Hutchin&s;on, Mr. Harley, and
Mr. Robert Walpole, which la&s;t, however, voted after|wards
for the bill. In the Hou&s;e of Lords, it was &s;trenu|ou&s;ly
oppo&s;ed by the Earls of Oxford, Strafford, and Lord
Harcourt. Their objections were an&s;wered by Lort
Carterect. The bill pa&s;&s;ed by a great majority; but divers
lords entered a prote&s;t. This affair being di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, a bill
was brought in for ve&s;ting in tru&s;tees the forfeited e&s;tates
in Britain and Ireland, to be &s;old for the u&s;e of the pub|lick;
for giving relief to lawful creditors, by determining
the claims; and for the more effectual bringing into the
re&s;pective exchequers the rents and profits of the e&s;tates
till &s;old. The time of claiming was prolonged: the &s;um
<PB N="338" REF="344">
of twenty thou&s;and pounds was re&s;erved out of the &s;ale of
the e&s;tates in Scotland, for erecting &s;chools; and eight
thou&s;and pounds for building barracks in that kingdom.
The King having &s;ignified,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oldmixon.</NOTE> by a me&s;&s;age to the Hou&s;e of
Commons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Annals.</NOTE> that he had lately received &s;uch information

<P>&sect; VI. The King of Spain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1718.</NOTE> by the care and indefati|gable
diligence of his prime mini&s;ter, Cardinal Alberoni,
equipped a very formidable armament, which, in the be|ginning
of June, &s;et &s;ail from Barcelona towards Italy;
but the de&s;tination of it was not known. A &s;trong &s;qua|dron
having been fitted out in England, the Marquis de
Monteleone, amba&s;&s;ador from Spain, pre&s;ented a memo|rial
to the Briti&s;h mini&s;try, importing that &s;o powerful an
armament in time of peace could not but give umbrage to
the King his ma&s;ter, and alter the good intelligence that
&s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the two crowns. In an&s;wer to this re|pre&s;entation,
the mini&s;ters declared that the King intend|ed
to &s;end Admiral Byng with a powerful &s;quadron into
the Mediterranean, to maintain the neutrality in Italy.
<PB N="339" REF="345">
Mean while,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. II. 1718.</NOTE> the negociations between the Engli&s;h and
French mini&s;ters produced the quadruple alliance, by
which King George and the Regent pre&s;cribed a peace
between the Emperor, the King of Spain, and the King
of Sicily, and undertook to compel Philip and the Savoy|ard
to &s;ubmit to &s;uch conditions as they had concerted
with his Imperial Maje&s;ty. The&s;e powers were allowed
only three months to con&s;ider the articles, and declare
whether they would reject them, or acquie&s;ce in the par|tition.
Nothing could be more contradictory to the true
intere&s;t of Great-Britain than this treaty, which de&s;troyed
the balance in Italy, by throwing &s;uch an acce&s;&s;ion of
power into the hands of the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. It inter|rupted
the commerce with Spain; involved the kingdom
in an immediate war with that monarchy; and gave ri&s;e
to all the quarrels and di&s;putes which have ari&s;en between
England and Spain in the &s;equel. The States-General did
not approve of &s;uch violent mea&s;ures, and for &s;ome
time kept aloof: but at length they acceded to the qua|druple
alliance, which indeed was no other than a very
expen&s;ive compliment to the Emperor, who was de&s;irous
of adding Sicily to his other Italian dominions.</P>
<P>&sect; VII. The King of England had u&s;ed &s;ome endeavours
to compromi&s;e the difference between his Imperial Ma|je&s;ty
and the Spani&s;h branch of the Hou&s;e of Bourbon.
Lord Stanhope had been &s;ent to Madrid with a plan of
pacification, which being rejected by Philip, as partial
and iniquitious, the King determined to &s;upport his me|diation
by force of arms. Sir George Byng &s;ailed from
Spithead on the fourth day of June, with twenty &s;hips of
the line, two fire-&s;hips, two bomb-ve&s;&s;els, and ample in|&s;tructions
how to act on all emergencies. He arrived off
Cape St. Vincent on the thirtieth day of the month, and
di&s;patched his &s;ecretary to Cadiz, with a letter to Colonel

in ca&s;e the Spaniards do &s;till in&s;i&s;t, with their &s;hips of
war and forces, to attack the kingdom of Naples, or
other the territories of the Emperor in Italy, or to land
in any part of Italy, which can only be with a de&s;ign
to invade the Emperor's dominions, again&s;t whom only
they have declared war by invading Sardinia; or if
they &s;hould endeavour to make them&s;elves ma&s;ters of

with all your power, to hinder and ob&s;truct the &s;ame.
If it &s;hould &s;o happen, that at your arrival, with our
fleet under your command, in the Mediterranean, the
Spaniards &s;hould already have landed any troops in
Italy, in order to invade the Emperor's territories, you
&s;hall endeavour amicably to di&s;&s;uade them from per&s;e|vering
in &s;uch an attempt, and offer them your a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
to help them to withdraw their troops, and put
an end to all further acts of ho&s;tility. But in ca&s;e
the&s;e your friendly endeavours &s;hould prove ineffectual,
you &s;hall, by keeping company with, or intercepting
their &s;hips or convoy; or, if it be nece&s;&s;ary, by openly
oppo&s;ing them, defend the Emperor's territories from
any further attempt.&endq; When Cardinal Alberoni pe|ru&s;ed
the&s;e in&s;tructions, he told Colonel Stanhope, with
&s;ome warmth, that his ma&s;ter would run all hazards, and
even &s;uffer him&s;elf to be driven out of Spain, rather than
recall his troops, or con&s;ent to a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms. He
&s;aid the Spaniards were not to be frightened; and he was
&s;o well convinced that the fleet would do their duty, that
in ca&s;e of their being attacked by Admiral Byng, he &s;hould
be in no pain for the &s;ucce&s;s. Mr. Stanhope pre&s;enting
him with a li&s;t of the Briti&s;h &s;quadron, he threw it upon
the ground with great emotion. He promi&s;ed, however,
to lay the admiral's letter before the King, and to let the
envoy know his Maje&s;ty's re&s;olution. Such an inter|po&s;ition
could not but be very provoking to the Spani&s;h
mini&s;ter, who had laid his account with the conque&s;t of
<PB N="341" REF="347">
Sicily, and for that purpo&s;e prepared an armament which
was altogether &s;urpri&s;ing, con&s;idering the late &s;hattered
condition of the Spani&s;h affairs. But he &s;eems to have
put too much confidence in the &s;trength of the Spani&s;h
fleet. In a few days he &s;ent back the admiral's letter to
Mr. Stanhope, with a note under it, importing, that the
Chevalier Byng might execute the orders he had received
from the King his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>&sect; VIII. The admiral, in pa&s;&s;ing by Gibraltar, was
joined by Vice-Admiral Cornwall, with two &s;hips. He
proceeded to Minorca, where he relieved the garri&s;on of
Port-Mahon. Then he &s;ailed for Naples, where he arrived
on the fir&s;t day of Augu&s;t, and was received as a deliverer;
for the Neapolitans had been under the utmo&s;t terror of
an inva&s;ion from the Spaniards. Sir George Byng re|ceived
intelligence from the viceroy, Count Daun, who
treated him with the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing marks of re&s;pect,
that the Spani&s;h army, amounting to thirty thou&s;and men,
commanded by the Marquis de Lede, had landed in Sicily,
reduced Palermo and Me&s;&s;ina, and were then employed in
the &s;iege of the citadel belonging to this la&s;t city: that
the Piedmonte&s;e garri&s;on would be obliged to &s;urrender,
if not &s;peedily relieved: that an alliance was upon the
carpet between the Emperor and the King of Sicily, which
la&s;t had de&s;ired the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Imperial troops, and
agreed to receive them into the citadel of Me&s;&s;ina. The
admiral immediately re&s;olved to &s;ail thither, and took under
his convoy a re-enforcement of two thou&s;and Germans for
the citadel, under the command of General Wetzel. He
forthwith &s;ailed from Naples, and on the ninth day of
Augu&s;t was in &s;ight of the Faro of Me&s;&s;ina. He di&s;patched
his own captain, with a polite me&s;&s;age to the Marquis de
Lede, propo&s;ing a ce&s;&s;ation of arms in Sicily for two
months, that the powers of Europe might have time to
concert mea&s;ures for re&s;toring a la&s;ting peace; and de|claring,
that &s;hould this propo&s;al be rejected, he would, in
pur&s;uance of his in&s;tructions, u&s;e all his force to prevent
further attempts to di&s;turb the dominions his ma&s;ter had
<PB N="342" REF="348">
engaged to defend. The Spani&s;h general an&s;wered, that
he had no powers to treat, con&s;equently could not agree
to an armi&s;tice, but &s;hould obey his orders, which directed
him to reduce Sicily for his ma&s;ter the King of Spain.
The Spani&s;h fleet had &s;ailed from the harbour of Me&s;&s;ina
on the day before the Engli&s;h &s;quadron appeared. Admiral
Byng &s;uppo&s;ed they had retired to Malta, and directed
his cour&s;e towards Me&s;&s;ina, in order to encourage and
&s;upport the garri&s;on in the citadel. But, in doubling
the point of Faro, he de&s;cried two Spani&s;h &s;couts, and
learned from the people of a felucca from the Calabrian
&s;hore, that they had &s;een from the hills the Spani&s;h fleet
lying to in order of battle. The admiral immediately
detached the German troops to Reggio, under convoy of
two &s;hips of war. Then he &s;tood through the Faro after
the Spani&s;h &s;couts that led him to their main fleet, which
before noon he de&s;cried in line of battle, amounting to
&s;even-and-twenty &s;ail large and &s;mall, be&s;ides two fire-&s;hips,
four bomb-ve&s;&s;els, and &s;even gallies. They were
commanded in chief by Don Antonio de Ca&s;tanita, under
whom were the four rear-admirals Chacon, Mari, Gue|vara,
and Cammock. At &s;ight of the Engli&s;h &s;quadron,
they &s;tood away large, and Byng gave chace all the re&s;t of
the day. In the morning, which was the eleventh of Au|gu&s;t,
Rear-Admiral de Mari, with &s;ix &s;hips of war,
the gallies, fire-&s;hips, and bomb-ketches, &s;eparated from
the main fleet, and &s;tood in for the Sicilian &s;hore. The
Engli&s;h admiral detached Captain Walton with five &s;hips
in pur&s;uit of them, and they were &s;oon engaged. He
him&s;elf continued to cha&s;e their main fleet; and about ten
o'clock the battle began. The Spaniards &s;eemed to be
di&s;tracted in their councils, and acted in confu&s;ion. They
made a running &s;ight; yet the admirals behaved with
courage and activity, in &s;pite of which they were all taken,
except Cammock, who made his e&s;cape with three &s;hips
of war and three frigates. In this engagement, which
happened off Cape Pa&s;&s;aro, Captain Haddock, of the
Gra&s;ton, &s;ignali&s;ed his courage in an extraordinary man|ner,
<PB N="343" REF="349">
On the eighteenth the admiral received a letter from
Captain Walton, dated off Syracu&s;e, intimating that he had
taken four Spani&s;h &s;hips of war, together with a bomb-ketch,
and a ve&s;&s;el laden with arms: and that he had burn|ed
four &s;hips of the line, a fire-&s;hip, and a bomb-ve&s;&s;el<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>This letter is ju&s;tly deemed a curious &s;pecimen of the laconick &s;tyle.</P>

</LETTER></NOTE>.
Had the Spaniards followed the advice of Rear-Admiral
Cammock, who was a native of Ireland, Sir George Byng
would not have obtained &s;uch an ea&s;y victory. That officer
propo&s;ed that they &s;hould remain at anchor in the road of
Paradi&s;e, with their broad&s;ides to the &s;ea; in which ca&s;e
the Engli&s;h admiral would have found it a very difficult ta&s;k
to attack them: for the coa&s;t is &s;o bold, that the large&s;t
&s;hips could ride with a cable a&s;hore; whereas farther out
the currents are &s;o various and rapid, that the Engli&s;h &s;qua|dron
could not have come to anchor, or lie near them in
order of battle: be&s;ides, the Spaniards might have been re|enforced
from the army on &s;hore, which would have rai&s;ed
batteries to annoy the a&s;&s;ailants. Before King George had
received an account of this engagement from the admiral,
he wrote him a letter with his own hand, approving his
conduct. When Sir George's elde&s;t &s;on arrived in Eng|land,
with a circum&s;tantial account of the action, he was
graciou&s;ly received, and &s;ent back with plenipotentiary
powers to his father, that he might negociate with the &s;e|veral
princes and &s;tates of Italy, as he &s;hould &s;ee occa&s;ion.
The &s;on likewi&s;e carried the King's royal grant to the offi|cers
and &s;eamen, of all the prizes they had taken from the
Spaniards. Notwith&s;tanding this victory, the Spani&s;h
army carried on the &s;iege of the citadel of Me&s;&s;ini with
&s;uch vigour, that the governour &s;urrendered the place by
capitulation on the twenty-ninth day of September. A
treaty was now concluded at Vienna between the Empe|ror
<PB N="344" REF="350">
and the Duke of Savoy. They agreed to form an ar|my
for the conque&s;t of Sardinia in behalf of the Duke; and
in the mean time this prince engaged to evacuate Sicily;
but until his troops could be conveyed from that i&s;land,
he con&s;ented that they &s;hould co-operate with the Germans
again&s;t the common enemy. Admiral Byng continued to
a&s;&s;i&s;t the Imperiali&s;ts in Sicily, during the be&s;t part of the
winter, by &s;couring the &s;eas of the Spaniards, and keeping
the communication open between the German forces and
the Calabrian &s;hore, from whence they were &s;upplied with
provi&s;ions. He acted in this &s;ervice with equal conduct,
re&s;olution, and activity. He conferred with the viceroy
of Naples, and the other Imperial generals, about the opera|tions
of the en&s;uing campaign, and Count Hamilton was
di&s;patched to Vienna, to lay before the Emperor the re&s;ult
of their deliberations: then the admiral &s;et &s;ail for Mahon,
where his &s;hips might be re&s;itted, and put in a condition
to take the &s;ea in the &s;pring.</P>
<P>&sect; IX. The de&s;truction of the Spani&s;h fleet was a &s;ubject
that employed the deliberations and conjectures of all the
politicians in Europe. Spain exclaimed again&s;t the con|duct
of England, as incon&s;i&s;tent with the rules of good
faith, for the ob&s;ervation of which &s;he had always been
&s;o famous. The Marquis de Monteleone wrote a letter
to Mr. Secretary Craggs, in which he expo&s;tulated with
him upon &s;uch an unprecedented outrage. Cardinal Al|beroni,
in a letter to that mini&s;ter, inveighed again&s;t it as
a ba&s;e, unworthy action. He &s;aid the neutrality of Italy
was a weak pretence, &s;ince every body knew that neu|trality
had long been at an end; and that the princes gua|rantees
of the treaty of U$recht were entirely di&s;charged
from their engagements, not only by the &s;candalous in|fringements
committed by the Au&s;trians in the evacuation
of Catalonia and Majorca; but al&s;o becau&s;e the guarantee
was no longer binding than till a peace was concluded
with France. He taxed the Briti&s;h mini&s;try with having
revived and &s;upported this neutrality, not by an amicable
<PB N="345" REF="351">
mediation, but by open violence, and artfully abu&s;ing the
confidence and &s;ecurity of the Spaniards. This was the
language of di&s;appointed ambition. Neverthele&s;s, it mu&s;t
be owned, that the conduct of England, on this occa&s;ion,
was irregular, partial, and precipitate.</P>
<P>&sect; X. The parliament meeting on the eleventh day of
November, the King, in his &s;peech, declared that the
court of Spain had rejected all his amicable propo&s;als, and
broke through their mo&s;t &s;olemn engagements for the
&s;ecurity of the Briti&s;h commerce. To vindicate, there|fore,
the faith of his former treaties, as well as to maintain
tho&s;e he had lately made, and to protect and defend the
trade of his &s;ubjects, which had in every branch been
violently and unju&s;tly oppre&s;&s;ed, it became nece&s;&s;ary for his
naval forces to check their progre&s;s: that, notwith&s;tanding
the &s;ucce&s;s of his arms, that court had lately given orders
at all the ports of Spain and of the We&s;t-Indies, to &s;it
out privateers again&s;t the Engli&s;h. He &s;aid he was per&s;uad|ed
that a Briti&s;h parliament would enable him to re&s;ent
&s;uch treatment; and he a&s;&s;ured them that his good brother,
the Regent of France, was ready to concur with him in the
mo&s;t vigorous mea&s;ures. A &s;trong oppo&s;ition was made
in both Hou&s;es to the motion for an addre&s;s of thanks and
congratulation propo&s;ed by Lord Carteret. Several peers
ob&s;erved, that &s;uch an addre&s;s was, in effect, to approve
a &s;ea-fight which might be attended with dangerous con|&s;equences,
and to give the &s;anction of that augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly
to mea&s;ures which, upon examination, might appear either
to cla&s;h with the law of nations, or former treaties, or to
be prejudicial to the trade of Great-Britain: that they
ought to proceed with the utmo&s;t caution and mature&s;t
deliberation, in an affair wherein the honour, as well as
the intere&s;t of the nation were &s;o highly concerned.
Lord Strafford moved for an addre&s;s, that Sir George
Byng's in&s;tructions might be laid before the Hou&s;e. Earl
Stanhope replied, that there was no occa&s;ion for &s;uch an
addre&s;s, &s;ince by his Maje&s;ty's command he had already
laid before the Hou&s;e the treaties, of which the late &s;ea-fight
<PB N="346" REF="352">
was a con&s;equence: particularly the treaty for a de|fen&s;ive
alliance between the Emperor and his Maje&s;ty, con|cluded
at We&s;tmin&s;ter on the twenty-fifth day of May,
in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;ixteen; and
the treaty of alliance for re&s;toring and &s;ettling the publick
peace, &s;igned at London on the twenty-&s;econd day of
July. He affirmed that the court of Spain had violated
the treaty of Utrecht, and acted again&s;t the publick faith,
in attacking the Emperor's dominions, while he was en|gaged
in a war again&s;t the enemies of Chri&s;tendom: that
they had rejected his Maje&s;ty's friendly offices and offers
for mediating an accommodation. He explained the
cau&s;e of his own journey to Spain, and his negociations at
Madrid. He added, it was high time to check the growth
of the naval power of Spain, in order to protect and &s;e|cure
the trade of the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, which had been vio|lently
oppre&s;&s;ed by the Spaniards. After a long debate,
the motion was carried by a con&s;iderable majority. The
&s;ame &s;ubject excited di&s;putes of the &s;ame nature in the
Hou&s;e of Commons, where Lord Hinchingbroke moved
that, in their addre&s;s of thanks, they &s;hould declare their
entire &s;atisfaction in tho&s;e mea&s;ures which the King had
already taken for &s;trengthening the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion,
and e&s;tabli&s;hing a la&s;ting tranquillity in Europe. The mem|bers
in the oppo&s;ition urged that it was unparliamentary
and unprecedented, on the fir&s;t day of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, to enter
upon particulars: that the bu&s;ine&s;s in que&s;tion was of the
highe&s;t importance, and de&s;erved the mo&s;t mature delibe|ration;
that, before they approved the mea&s;ures which had
been taken, they ought to examine the rea&s;ons on which
tho&s;e mea&s;ures were founded. Mr. Robert Walpole af|firmed,
that the giving &s;anction, in the manner propo&s;ed,
to the late mea&s;ures, could have no other view than that
of &s;creening mini&s;ters, who were con&s;cious of having be|gun
a war again&s;t Spain, and now wanted to make it the
parliament's war. He ob&s;erved that, in&s;tead of an entire
&s;atisfaction, they ought to expre&s;s their entire di&s;&s;atisfaction
with &s;uch conduct as was contrary to the law of nations,
<PB N="347" REF="353">
and a breach of the mo&s;t &s;olemn treaties. Mr. Secretary
Craggs, in a long &s;peech, explained the nature of the qua|druple
alliance, and ju&s;tified all the mea&s;ures which had
been taken. The addre&s;s, as moved by Lord Hinching|broke,
was at length carried, and pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty.
Then the Commons proceeded to con&s;ider the &s;upply.
They voted thirteen thou&s;and five hundred &s;ailors; and
twelve thou&s;and four hundred thirty-five men for the
land-&s;ervice. The whole e&s;timate amounted to two mil|lions
two hundred and fifty-&s;even thou&s;and five hundred
eighty-one pounds, nineteen &s;hillings. The money was
rai&s;ed by a land-tax, malt-tax, and lottery.</P>
<P>&sect; XI. On the thirteenth day of December, Earl Stan|hope
declared, in the Hou&s;e of Lords, that, in order to
unite the hearts of the well-affected to the pre&s;ent e&s;tab|li&s;hment,
he had a bill to offer, under the title of &startq;An act
for &s;trengthening the prote&s;tant intere&s;t in the&s;e king|doms.&endq;
It was accordingly read, and appeared to be a
bill repealing the acts again&s;t occa&s;ional conformity, the
growth of &s;chi&s;m, and &s;ome clau&s;es in the corporation
and te&s;t acts. This had been concerted by the mini&s;try,
in private meetings with the mo&s;t eminent di&s;&s;enters.
The Tory lords were a&s;toni&s;hed at this motion, for which
they were altogether unprepared. Neverthele&s;s, they
were &s;trenuous in their oppo&s;ition. They alledged that
the bill, in&s;tead of &s;trengthening, would certainly weaken
the church of England, by plucking off her be&s;t feathers,
inve&s;ting her enemies with power, and &s;haring with church|men
the civil and military employments of which they
were then wholly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Earl Cowper declared him|&s;elf
again&s;t that part of the bill by which &s;ome clau&s;es of
the te&s;t and corporation acts were repealed; becau&s;e he
looked upon tho&s;e acts as the main bulwark of our excel|lent
con&s;titution in church and &s;tate, which ought to be
inviolably pre&s;erved. The Earl of Ilay oppo&s;ed the bill,
becau&s;e, in his opinion, it infringed the <HI>pacta conventa</HI> of
the treaty of union, by which the bounds both of the
church of England and of the church of Scotland were
<PB N="348" REF="354">
fixed and &s;ettled; and he was apprehen&s;ive, if the articles
of the Union were broke with re&s;pect to one church, it
might afterwards be a precedent to break them with re|&s;pect
to the other. The Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury &s;aid
the acts which by this bill would be repealed were the
main bulwark and &s;upporters of the Engli&s;h church: he
expre&s;&s;ed all imaginable tenderne&s;s for well-meaning
con&s;cientious di&s;&s;enters; but he could not forbear &s;aying
&s;ome among that &s;ect made a wrong u&s;e of the favour and
indulgence &s;hown to them at the Revolution, though they
had the lea&s;t &s;hare in that happy event: it was, therefore,
thought nece&s;&s;ary for the legi&s;lature to interpo&s;e, and put
a &s;top to the &s;candalous practice of occa&s;ional conformity.
He added, that it would be needle&s;s to repeat the act again&s;t
&s;chi&s;m, &s;ince no advantage had been taken of it, to the
prejudice of the di&s;&s;enters. Dr. Hoadley, Bi&s;hop of Ban|gor,
endeavoured to prove that the occa&s;ional and &s;chi&s;m
acts were in effect per&s;ecuting laws; and that by admit|ting
the principle of &s;elf-defence and &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, in
matters of religion, all the per&s;ecutions maintained by the
heathens again&s;t the profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity, and even
the popi&s;h Inqui&s;ition, might be ju&s;tified. With re&s;pect to
the power of which many clergymen appeared &s;o &s;ond and
&s;o zealous, he owned the de&s;ire of power and riches was
natural to all men; but that he had learned both from
rea&s;on and from the go&s;pel, that this de&s;ire mu&s;t be kep$
within due bounds, and not entrench upon the rights and
liberties of their fellow-creatures and countrymen. After
a long debate, the Hou&s;e agreed to leave out &s;ome clau&s;es
concerning the te&s;t and corporation acts: then the bill
was committed, and afterwards pa&s;&s;ed. In the Lower
Hou&s;e it met with violent oppo&s;ition, in &s;pite of which it
was carried by the majority.</P>
<P>&sect; XII. The King, on the &s;eventeenth day of Decem|ber,
&s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the Commons, importing that all
his endeavours to procure redre&s;s for the injuries done to
his &s;ubjects by the King of Spain having proved ineffec|tual,
he had found it nece&s;&s;ary to declare war again&s;t that
<PB N="349" REF="355">
monarch. When a motion was made for an addre&s;s,
to a&s;&s;ure the King they would chearfully &s;upport him in
the pro&s;ecution of the war, Mr Shippen and &s;ome other
members &s;aid they did not &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of involving
the nation in a war on account of &s;ome grievances of
which the merchants complained, as the&s;e might be amica|bly
redre&s;&s;ed. Mr. Stanhope a&s;&s;ured the Hou&s;e, that he
had pre&s;ented five-and-twenty memorials to the mini&s;try
of Spain on that &s;ubject, without &s;ucce&s;s. Mr. Methuen
accounted for the dilatory proceeding of the Spani&s;h court
in commercial affairs, by explaining the great variety of
regulations in the &s;everal provinces and ports of that king|dom.
It was &s;ugge&s;ted, that the mini&s;try paid very little
regard to the trade and intere&s;t of the nation; ina&s;much
as it appeared by the an&s;wer from a &s;ecretary of &s;tate to
the letter of the Marquis de Monteleone, that they would
have overlooked the violation of the treaties of commerce,
provided Spain had accepted the conditions &s;tipulated in
the quadruple alliance; for it was there expre&s;sly &s;aid
that his Maje&s;ty, the King of Great-Britain, did not &s;eek
to aggrandi&s;e him&s;elf by any new acqui&s;ition, but was ra|ther
inclined to &s;acrifice &s;omething of his own to procure
the general quiet and tranquillity of Europe. A member
ob&s;erved that nobody could tell how far that &s;acrifice
would have extended; but certainly it was a very uncom|mon
&s;tretch of conde&s;cen&s;ion. This &s;acrifice was &s;aid to
be the ce&s;&s;ion of Gibraltar and Port-Mahon, which the Re|gent
of France had offered to the King of Spain, provided
he would accede to the quadruple alliance. Horatio Wal|pole
ob&s;erved, that the di&s;po&s;ition of Sicily in favour of
the Emperor was an infraction of the treaty of Utrecht;
and his brother exclaimed again&s;t the inju&s;tice of attack|ing
the Spani&s;h &s;leet before a declaration of war. Not|with&s;tanding
all the&s;e arguments and objections, the ma|jority
agreed to the addre&s;s; and &s;uch another was carried
in the Upper Hou&s;e without a divi&s;ion. The declaration
of war again&s;t Spain was publi&s;hed with the u&s;ual &s;olem|nities;
but this war was not a favourite of the people, and,
<PB N="350" REF="356">
therefore, did not produce tho&s;e acclamations that were
u&s;ual on &s;uch occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>&sect; XIII. Mean while Cardinal Alberoni employed all his
intrigues, power, and indu&s;try, for the gratification of his
revenge. He cau&s;ed new &s;hips to be built, the &s;ea-ports
to be put in a po&s;ture of defence, &s;uccours to be &s;ent to
Sicily, and the proper mea&s;ures to be taken for the &s;ecurity
of Sardinia. He, by means of the Prince de Cellamare,
the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador at Paris, caballed with the mal|contents
of that kingdom, who were numerous and power|ful.
A &s;cheme was actually formed for &s;ei&s;ing the Regent,
and &s;ecuring the per&s;on of the King. The Duke of Or|leans
owed the fir&s;t intimation of this plot to King
George, who gave him to under&s;tand, that a con&s;piracy
was formed again&s;t his per&s;on and government. The Re|gent
immediately took mea&s;ures for watching the conduct
of all &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons; but the whole intrigue was di&s;|covered
by accident. The Prince de Cellamare entru&s;ted
his di&s;patches to the Abb&eacute; Portocarrero, and to a &s;on of the
Marquis de Monteleone. The&s;e emi&s;&s;aries &s;et out from
Paris in a po&s;t-chai&s;e, and were overturned. The po&s;tillion
overheard Portocarrero &s;ay he would not have lo&s;t his
portmanteau for a hundred thou&s;and pi&s;toles. The man,
at his return to Paris, gave notice to the government of
what he had ob&s;erved. The Spaniards being pur&s;ued,
were overtaken and &s;ei&s;ed at Poitiers, with the portman|$eau,
in which the Regent found two letters that made
him acquainted with the particulars of the con&s;piracy.
The Prince de Cellamare was immediately conducted to
the frontiers: the Duke of Maine, the Marquis de Pom|padour,
the Cardinal de Polignac, and many other per&s;ons
of di&s;tinction, were committed to different pri&s;ons. The
Regent declared war again&s;t Spain, on the twenty-ninth
day of December; and an army of &s;ix-and-thirty thou&s;and
men began its march towards that kingdom in January,
under the command of the Duke of Berwick.</P>
<P>&sect; XIV. Cardinal Alberoni had likewi&s;e formed a &s;cheme
in &s;avour of the Pretender. The Duke of Ormond
<PB N="351" REF="357">
repairing to Madrid, held conferences with his eminence;
and mea&s;ures were concerted for exciting another in&s;ur|rection
in Great-Britain. The Chevalier de St. George
quitted Urbino by &s;tealth; and embarking at Nettuno,
landed at Cagliari in March. From thence he took his
pa&s;&s;age to Ro&s;es in Catalonia, and proceeded to Madrid,
where he was received with great cordiality, and treated
as King of Great-Britain. An armament had been equip|ped
of ten &s;hips of war and tran&s;ports, having on board
&s;ix thou&s;and regular troops, with arms for twelve thou&s;and
men. The command of this fleet was be&s;towed on the
Duke of Ormond, with the title of Captain-General of
his Mo&s;t Catholick Maje&s;ty. He was provided with de|clarations
in the name of that king, importing that for
many good rea&s;ons he had &s;ent part of his land and &s;ea
forces into England and Scotland, to act as auxiliaries to
King James. His Britannick Maje&s;ty, having received
from the Regent of France timely notice of this intended
inva&s;ion, offered, by proclamation, rewards to tho&s;e that
&s;hould apprehend the Duke of Ormond, or any gentleman
embarked in that expedition. Troops were ordered to
a&s;&s;emble in the north, and in the we&s;t of England: two
thou&s;and men were demanded of the States-General: a
&s;trong &s;quadron was equipped to oppo&s;e the Spani&s;h arma|ment;
and the Duke of Orleans made a proffer to King
George of twenty battalions for his &s;ervice.</P>
<P>&sect; XV. His Maje&s;ty having communicated to both
Hou&s;es of parliament the repeated advices he had received
touching this projected de&s;cent, they promi&s;ed to &s;upport
him again&s;t all his enemies. They de&s;ired he would aug|ment
his forces by &s;ea and land; and a&s;&s;ured him they
would make good the extraordinary expen&s;e. Two thou|&s;and
men were landed from Holland, and &s;ix battalions
of Imperiali&s;ts from the Au&s;trian Netherlands. The Duke
of Ormond &s;ailed from Cadiz, and proceeded as far as
Cape Fini&s;terre, where his fleet was di&s;per&s;ed and di&s;abled
by a violent &s;torm, which entirely defeated the purpo&s;ed
expedition. Two frigates, however, arrived in Scotland,
<PB N="352" REF="358">
with the Earls Mari&s;chal and Seaforth, the Marquis of
Tullibardine, &s;ome field-officers, three hundred Spaniards,
and arms for two thou&s;and men. They were joined by
a &s;mall body of Highlanders, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of
Donan Ca&s;tle. Again&s;t the&s;e adventurers General Wight|man
marched with a body of regular troops from Inverne&s;s.
They had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the pa&s;s of Glen&s;hiel; but, at
the approach of the King's forces, retired to the pa&s;s at
Strachell, which they re&s;olved to defend. They were at|tacked
and driven from one eminence to another till
night, when the Highlanders di&s;per&s;ed; and next day the
Spaniards &s;urrendered them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war. Ma|ri&s;chal,
Seaforth, and Tullibardine, with &s;ome officers,
retired to one of the we&s;tern i&s;les, in order to wait for an
opportunity of being conveyed to the continent.</P>
<P>&sect; XVI. On the la&s;t day of February the Duke of So|mer&s;et
repre&s;ented in the Hou&s;e of Lords, that the num|ber
of peers being very much increa&s;ed, e&s;pecially &s;ince
the union of the two kingdoms, it &s;eemed ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to take effectual mea&s;ures for preventing the in|conveniencies
that might attend the creation of a great
number of peers, to &s;erve a pre&s;ent purpo&s;e: an expedient
which had been actually taken in the late reign. He, there|fore,
moved that a bill &s;hould be brought in, to &s;ettle and
limit the peerage, in &s;uch a manner, that the number of
Engli&s;h peers &s;hould not be enlarged beyond &s;ix above the
pre&s;ent number, which, upon failure of male i&s;&s;ue, might be
&s;upplied by new creations: that, in&s;tead of the &s;ixteen elec|tive
peers from Scotland, twenty-five &s;hould be made here|ditary
on the part of that kingdom; and that this num|ber,
upon failure of heirs male, &s;hould be &s;upplied from
the other members of the Scotti&s;h peerage. This bill was
intended as a re&s;traint upon the Prince of Wales, who
happened to be at variance with the pre&s;ent mini&s;try.
The motion was &s;upported by the Duke of Argyle, now
lord-&s;teward of the hou&s;ehold, the Earls of Sunderland
and Carli&s;le. It was oppo&s;ed by the Earl of Oxford, who
&s;aid, that although he expected nothing from the crown,
<PB N="353" REF="359">
he would never give his vote for lopping off &s;o valuable a
branch of the prerogative, which enabled the King to re|ward
merit and virtuous actions. The debate was ad|journed
to the &s;econd day of March, when Earl Stanhope
delivered a me&s;&s;age from the King, intimating, that as they
had under con&s;ideration the &s;tate of the Briti&s;h peerage,
he had &s;o much at heart the &s;ettling it upon &s;uch a foun|dation
as might &s;ecure the freedom and con&s;titution of
parliaments in all future ages, that he was willing his pre|rogative
&s;hould not &s;tand in the way of &s;o great and nece&s;|&s;ary
a work. Another violent debate en&s;ued between the
two factions. The que&s;tion here, as in almo&s;t every other
di&s;pute, was not, Whether the mea&s;ure propo&s;ed was ad|vantageous
to the nation? but, Whether the Tory or the
Whig intere&s;t &s;hould predominate in parliament? Earl
Cowper affirmed that the part of the bill relating to the
Scotti&s;h peerage was a manife&s;t violation of the treaty of
union, as well as a flagrant piece of inju&s;tice, as it would
deprive per&s;ons of their right, without being heard, and
without any preten&s;e or forfeiture on their part. He ob|&s;erved
that the Scotti&s;h peers excluded from the number
of the twenty-five would be in a wor&s;e condition than
any other &s;ubjects in the kingdom; for they would be nei|ther
electing nor elected, neither repre&s;enting nor repre|&s;ented.
The&s;e objections were over-ruled;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Annals.</NOTE> &s;everal re&s;o|lutions
were taken agreeably to the motion;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Corbet.</NOTE> and the
judges were ordered to prepare and bring in the bill.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tindal.</NOTE>
This mea&s;ure alarmed the generality of Scotti&s;h peers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi&s;t. Reg.</NOTE> as
well as many Engli&s;h commoners,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deb. in Par.</NOTE> who &s;aw in the bill the
avenues of dignity and title &s;hut up again&s;t them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the Admirals.</NOTE> and
they did not fail to exclaim again&s;t it, as an encroachment
upon the fundamental maxims of the con&s;titution. Trea|ti&s;es
were writ and publi&s;hed on both &s;ides of the que&s;tion;
and a national clamour began to ari&s;e, when Earl Stan|hope
ob&s;erved, in the Hou&s;e, that as the bill had rai&s;ed
&s;trange apprehen&s;ions, he thought it advi&s;eable to po&s;tpone
the further con&s;ideration of it till a more proper oppor|tunity.
It was accordingly dropped, and the parliament
<PB N="354" REF="360">
prorogued on th&eacute; eighteenth day of April, on which oc|ca&s;ion
his Maje&s;ty told both Hou&s;es, that the Spani&s;h King
had acknowledged the Pretender.</P>
<P>&sect; XVII.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1719.</NOTE> The King having appointed lords-ju&s;tices to
rule the kingdom in his ab&s;ence, embarked in May &s;o
Holland, from whence he proceeded to Hanover, when
he concluded a peace with Ulrica, the new Queen of Swe|den.
By this treaty Sweden yielded for ever to the royal
and electoral hou&s;e of Brun&s;wick the duchies of Bremen
and Verden, with all their dependencies: King Geroge
obliged him&s;elf to pay a million of rixdollars to the Queer
of Sweden; and to renew, as King of Great-Britain and
Elector of Hanover, the alliances formerly &s;ub&s;i&s;ting be|tween
his predece&s;&s;ors and that kingdom. He likewi&s;e
mediated a peace between Sweden and his former allies,
the Danes, the Pru&s;&s;ians, and the Poles. The Czar, how|ever,
refu&s;ed to give up his &s;chemes of conque&s;t. He &s;ent
his fleet to the Scheuron or Bat&s;es of Sweden, where his
troops landing, to the number of fifteen thou&s;and, com|mitted
dreadful outrages; but Sir John Norris, who com|manded
an Engli&s;h &s;quadron in tho&s;e &s;eas, having orders
to &s;upport the negociations, and oppo&s;e any ho&s;tilities that
might be committed, the Czar, dreading the fate of the
Spani&s;h navy, thought proper to recall his fleet. In the
Mediterranean, Admiral Byng acted with unwearied vi|gour
in a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Imperiali&s;ts to fini&s;h the conque&s;t of
Sicily. The court of Vienna had agreed to &s;end a &s;trong
body of forces to fini&s;h the reduction of that i&s;land; and
the command in this expedition was be&s;towed upon the
Count de Merci, with whom Sir George Byng conferred
at Naples. This admiral &s;upplied them with ammunition
and artillery from the Spani&s;h prizes. He took the whole
re-enforcement under his convoy, and &s;aw them &s;afely
landed in the bay of Patti, to the number of three thou|&s;and
five hundred hor&s;e, and ten thou&s;and infantry. Count$
Merci thinking him&s;elf more than a match for the Spani&s;h
forces commanded by the Marquis de Lede, attacked him
in a &s;trong camp at Franca-Villa; and was repul&s;ed with
<PB N="355" REF="361">
the lo&s;s of five thou&s;and men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. II. 1719.</NOTE> him&s;elf being dangerou&s;ly
wounded in the action. Here his army mu&s;t have peri&s;hed
for want of provi&s;ion, had not they been &s;upplied by the
Engli&s;h navy.</P>
<P>&sect; XVIII. Admiral Byng no &s;ooner learned the bad &s;uc|ce&s;s
of the attack at Franca-Villa, than he embarked two
battalions from the garri&s;on of Melazzo, and about a
thou&s;and recruits, whom he &s;ent under a convoy through
the Faro to Sche&s;o-bay, in order to re-enforce the Imperial
army. He afterwards a&s;&s;i&s;ted at a council of war with the
German generals, who, in con&s;equence of his advice, un|dertook
the &s;iege of Me&s;&s;ina. Then he repaired to Na|ples,
where he propo&s;ed to Count Gallas, the new viceroy,
that the troops de&s;tined for the conque&s;t of Sardinia &s;hould
be fir&s;t landed in Sicily, and co-operate towards the con|que&s;t
of that i&s;land. The propo&s;al was immediately di&s;|patched
to the court of Vienna. In the mean time, the
Admiral returned to Sicily, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the &s;iege of
Me&s;&s;ina. The town &s;urrendered: the garri&s;on retired into
the citadel; and the remains of the Spani&s;h navy, which
had e&s;caped at Pa&s;&s;aro, were now de&s;troyed in the Mole.
The Emperor approved of the &s;cheme propo&s;ed by the
Engli&s;h admiral, to whom he wrote a very gracious letter,
intimating that he had di&s;patched orders to the Governor
of Milan, to detach the troops de&s;igned for Sardinia to
Vado, in order to be tran&s;ported into Italy. The admiral
charged him&s;elf with the performance of this &s;ervice.
Having furni&s;hed the Imperial army before Me&s;&s;ina with
another &s;upply of cannon, powder, and &s;hot, upon his own
credit, he &s;et &s;ail for Vado, where he &s;urmounted number|le&s;s
difficulties, &s;tarted by the jealou&s;y of Count Bonneval,
who was unwilling to &s;ee his troops, de&s;tined for Sardinia,
now diverted to another expedition, in which he could
not enjoy the chief command. At length, Admiral Byng
&s;aw the forces embarked, and convoyed them to Me&s;&s;ina,
the citadel of which &s;urrendered in a few days after their
arrival. By this time the Marquis de Lede had fortified a
<PB N="356" REF="362">
&s;trong po&s;t at Ca&s;tro-Giovanne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1719.</NOTE> in the centre of the i&s;land;
and cantoned his troops about Aderno, Palermo, and Ca|tanea.
The Imperiali&s;ts could not pretend to attack him
in this &s;ituation, nor could they remain in the neighbour|hood
of Me&s;&s;ina, on account of the &s;arcity of provi&s;ions.
They would, therefore, have been obliged to quit the i&s;land
during the winter, had not the admiral undertaken to
tran&s;port them by &s;ea to Trapani, where they could extend
them&s;elves in a plentiful country. He not only executed
this enterpri&s;e; but even &s;upplied them with corn from
Tunis, as the harve&s;ts of Sicily had been gathered into the
Spani&s;h magazines. It was the &s;econd day of March
before the la&s;t embarkation of the Imperial troops were
landed at Trapani.</P>
<P>&sect; XIX. The Marquis de Lede immediately retired with
his army to Alcamo, from whence he &s;ent his mare&s;chal
de camp to Count Merci and the Engli&s;h admiral, with
overtures for evacuating Sicily. The propo&s;als were not
di&s;agreeable to the Germans; but Sir George Byng de|clared
that the Spaniards &s;hould not quit the i&s;land while
the war continued, as he fore&s;aw that the&s;e troops would
be employed again&s;t France or England. He agreed,
however, with Count Merci, in propo&s;ing, that if the
Marquis would &s;urrender Palermo, and retire into the
middle part of the i&s;land, they would con&s;ent to an ar|mi&s;tice
for &s;ix weeks, until the &s;entiments of their different
courts &s;hould be known. The Marquis offered to &s;urrender
Palermo, in con&s;ideration of a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms for three
months; but, while this negociation was depending, he
received advice from Madrid, that a general peace was
concluded. Neverthele&s;s, he broke off the treaty in obe|dience
to a &s;ecret order for that purpo&s;e. The King of
Spain hoped to obtain the re&s;titution of St. Seba&s;tian's,
Fontarabia, and other places taken in the cour&s;e of the war,
in exchange for the evacuation of Sicily. Ho&s;tilities were
continued until the admiral received advice from the Earl of
Stair at Paris, that the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador at the Hague had
<PB N="357" REF="363">
&s;igned the quadruple alliance. By the &s;ame courier pack|ets
were delivered to the Count de Merci and the Marquis
de Lede, which la&s;t gave the admiral and Imperial gene|ral
to under&s;tand that he looked upon the peace as a thing
concluded; and was ready to treat for a ce&s;&s;ation of
ho&s;tilities. They in&s;i&s;ted upon his delivering up Palermo:
on the other hand, he urged, that as their ma&s;ters were in
treaty for &s;ettling the terms of evacuating Sicily and Sar|dinia,
he did not think him&s;elf authori&s;ed to agree to a
ce&s;&s;ation, except on condition that each party &s;hould
remain on the ground they occupied, and expect further
orders from their principals. After a fruitle&s;s interview
between the three chiefs at the Ca&s;&s;ine de Ro&s;&s;ignola, the
Imperial general re&s;olved to undertake the &s;iege of Palermo:
with this view he decamped from Alcamo on the eighteenth
day of April, and followed the Marquis de Lede, who
retreated before him, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the advan|tageous
po&s;ts that commanded the pa&s;&s;es into the plain of
Palermo; but Count Merci, with indefatigable diligence,
marched over the mountains, while the admiral coa&s;ted
along-&s;hore, attending the motions of the army. The
Spani&s;h general perceiving the Germans advancing into
the plain, retired under the cannon of Palermo, and
fortified his camp with &s;trong entrenchments. On the
&s;econd day of May the Germans took one of the enemy's
redoubts by &s;urpri&s;e, and the Marquis de Lede ordered
all his forces to be drawn out to retake this fortification:
both armies were on the point of engaging when a courier
arrived in a felucca, with a packet for the Marquis, con|taining
full powers to treat and agree about the evacuation
of the i&s;land, and the tran&s;portation of the army to Spain.
He forthwith drew off his army; and &s;ent a trumpet to
the general and admiral, with letters, informing them of
the orders he had received. Commi&s;&s;ioners were appoint|ed
on each &s;ide, the negociations begun, and the con|ventions
&s;igned in a very few days. The Germans were
put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Palermo, and the Spani&s;h army marched
<PB N="358" REF="364">
to Tauromini, from whence they were tran&s;ported to Bar|celona.</P>
<P>&sect; XX. The admiral continued in the Mediterranean
until he had &s;een the i&s;lands of Sicily and Sardinia evacu|ated
by the Spaniards, and the mutual cessions executed
between the Emperor and the Duke of Savoy, in con&s;e|quence
of which, four battalions of Piedmonte&s;e troops
were tran&s;ported from Palermo to Sardinia, and took
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Cagliari in the name of their ma&s;ter. In a
word, Admiral Byng bore &s;uch a con&s;iderable &s;hare in
this war of Sicily, that the fate of the i&s;land depended
wholly on his courage, vigilance, and conduct. When
he waited on his Maje&s;ty at Hanover, he met with a
very gracious reception. The King told him he had
found out the &s;ecret of obliging his enemies as well as his
friends; for the court of Spain had mentioned him in the
mo&s;t honourable terms, with re&s;pect to his candid and
friendly deportment, in providing tran&s;ports and other
nece&s;&s;aries for the embarkation of their troops, and in
protecting them from oppre&s;&s;ion. He was appointed
trea&s;urer of the navy, and rear admiral of Great-Britain:
in a little time the King ennobled him, by the title of
Vi&s;count Torrington: he was declared a privy-coun&s;el|lor;
and afterwards made knight of the Bath, at the revival
of that order. During the&s;e occurrences in the Mediter|ranean,
the Duke of Berwick advanced with the French
army to the frontiers of Spain, where he took Fort-Pa&s;&s;age
and de&s;troyed &s;ix &s;hips of war that were on the &s;tocks:
then he reduced Fontarabia and St. Seba&s;tian's, together
with Port Antonio in the bottom of the Bay of Bi&s;$ay.
In this la&s;t exploit the French were a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a detach|ment
of Engli&s;h &s;eamen, who burned two large &s;hips un|fini&s;hed,
and a great quantity of naval &s;tores. The King
of England, with a view to indemnify him&s;elf for the ex|pen&s;e
of the war, projected the conque&s;t of Corunna in
Bi&s;cay, and of Peru in South-America. Four thou&s;and
men, commanded by Lord Cobham, were embarked at
the I&s;le of Wight, and &s;ailed on the twenty-fir&s;t day of
<PB N="359" REF="365">
September, under convoy of five &s;hips of war, conducted
by Admiral Mighels. In&s;tead of making an attempt upon
Corunna, they reduced Vigo with very little difficulty;
and Pont-a-Vedra &s;ubmitted without re&s;i&s;tance: here
they found &s;ome bra&s;s artillery, &s;mall arms, and military
&s;tores, with which they returned to England. In the
mean time Captain John&s;on, with two Engli&s;h &s;hips of
war, de&s;troyed the &s;ame number of Spani&s; &s;hips in the
port of Ribadeo, to the ea&s;tward of Cape Ortegas; &s;o that
the naval power of Spain was totally ruined. The ex|pedition
to the We&s;t-Indies was prevented by the peace.
Spain being oppre&s;&s;ed on all &s;ides, and utterly exhau&s;ted,
Philip &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;peedy pacification. He now
perceived the madne&s;s of Alberoni's ambitious projects.
That mini&s;ter was per&s;onally di&s;agreeable to the Emperor,
the King of England, and the Regent of France, who
had declared they would hearken to no propo&s;als while he
&s;hould continue in office: the Spani&s;h monarch, there|fore,
dive&s;ted him of his employment; and ordered him
to quit the kingdom in three weeks. The Marquis de
Beretti Landi, mini&s;ter from the court of Madrid at the
Hague, delivered a plan of pacification to the States: but
it was rejected by the allies; and Philip was obliged at la&s;t
to accede to the quadruple alliance.</P>
<P>&sect; XXI. On the fourteenth day of November King
George returned to England, and on the twenty-third
opened the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament with a &s;peech, in which
he told them, that all Europe as well as Great-Britain,
was on the point of being delivered from the calamities of
war, by the influence of Briti&s;h arms and councils. He
exhorted the Commons to concert proper means for
le&s;&s;ening the debts of the nation; and concluded with a
panegyrick upon his own government. It mu&s;t be owned
he had acted with equal vigour and deliberation in all the
troubles he had encountered &s;ince his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne.
The addre&s;&s;es of both Hou&s;es were as warm as he could
de&s;ire. They in particular extolled him for having inter|po&s;ed
in behalf of the prote&s;tants of Hungary, Poland,
<PB N="360" REF="366">
and Germany, who had been oppre&s;&s;ed by the practices
of the popi&s;h clergy, and pre&s;ented to him memorials, con|taining
a detail of their grievances. He and all the other
prote&s;tant powers warmly interceded in their favour; but
the grievances were not redre&s;&s;ed. The peerage-bill was
now revived by the Duke of Buckingham; and, in &s;pite
of all oppo&s;ition, pa&s;&s;ed through the Hou&s;e of Lords. It
had been projected by Earl Stanhope, and cagerly &s;up|ported
by the Earl of Sunderland; therefore, Mr. Robert
Walpole attacked it in the Hou&s;e of Commons with ex|traordinary
vehemence. Here too it was oppo&s;ed by a
con&s;iderable number of Whig members; and, after warm
debates, rejected by a large majority. The next object
that engro&s;&s;ed the attention of the parliament was a bill
for better &s;ecuring the dependency of Ireland upon the
crown of Great-Britain. Maurice Anne&s;ley had appealed
to the Hou&s;e of Peers in England, from a decree of the
Hou&s;e of Peers in Ireland, which was rever&s;ed. The
Briti&s;h peers ordered the Barons of the Exchequer in Ire|land
to put Mr. Anne&s;ley in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the lands he
had lo&s;t by the decree in that kingdom. The Baron$
obeyed this order; and the Iri&s;h Hou&s;e of Peers pa&s;&s;ed a
vote again&s;t them, as having acted in derogation to the
King's prerogative in his high court of parliament in Ire|land,
as al&s;o of the rights and privileges of that kingdom,
and of the parliament thereof: they, likewi&s;e, ordered them
to be taken into cu&s;tody of the u&s;her of the black-rod$:
they tran&s;mitted a long repre&s;entation to the King, de|mon&s;trating
their right to the final judicature of cau&s;es;
and the Duke of Leeds, in the Upper Hou&s;e, urged
fifteen rea&s;ons to &s;upport the claim of the Iri&s;h peers.
Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e arguments, the Hou&s;e of Lords in
England re&s;olved that the Barons of the Exchequer in
Ireland had acted with courage, according to law, in &s;up|port
of his Maje&s;ty's prerogative, and with &s;idelity to
the crown of Great-Britain. They addre&s;&s;ed the King to
con&s;er on them &s;ome marks of his royal favour, as a re|compen&s;e
for the ill u&s;age they had undergone. Finally,
<PB N="361" REF="367">
they prepared the bill, by which the Iri&s;h Hou&s;e of Lords
was deprived of all right to pa&s;s &s;entence, affirm, or rever&s;e
any judgment or decree, given or made in any court with|in
that kingdom. In the Hou&s;e of Commons it was op|po&s;ed
by Mr. Pitt, Mr. Hungerford, Lords Mole&s;worth
and Tyrconnel: but was carried by the majority, and
received the royal a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>&sect; XXII. The King's having recommended to the Com|mons
the con&s;ideration of proper means for le&s;&s;ening the
national debt was a prelude to the famous South-Sea act,
which became productive of &s;o much mi&s;chief and infatu|ation.
The &s;cheme was projected by Sir John Blunt,
who had been bred a &s;crivener, and was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the
cunning, plau&s;ibility, and boldne&s;s requi&s;ite for &s;uch an
undertaking. He communicated his plan to Mr. Ai&s;labie,
the chancellor of the Exchequer, as well as to one of the
&s;ecretaries of &s;tate. He an&s;wered all their objections;
and the project was adopted. They fore&s;aw their own
private advantage in the execution of the de&s;ign, which
was imparted in the name of the South-Sea company, of
which Blunt was a director, who influenced all their pro|ceedings.
The pretence for the &s;cheme was to di&s;charge
the national debt, by reducing all the funds into one.
The Bank and South-Sea company outbid each other.
The South-Sea company altered their original plan, and
offered &s;uch high terms to government, that the propo&s;als
of the Bank were rejected; and a bill was ordered to be
brought into the Hou&s;e of Commons, formed on the plan
pre&s;ented by the South-Sea company. While this a&s;&s;air
was in agitation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Annals.</NOTE> the &s;tock of that company ro&s;e from one
hundred and thirty to near four hundred,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Corbe$.</NOTE> in con&s;equence
of the conduct of the Commons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi&s;t. Reg.</NOTE> who had rejected a mo|tion
for a clau&s;e in the bill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tindal.</NOTE> to fix what &s;hare in the capi|tal

or how many years purcha&s;e in money they &s;hould receive
in &s;ub&s;cribing, at the choice of the proprietors.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1720.</NOTE> In the
Hou&s;e of Lords, the bill was oppo&s;ed by Lord North and
<PB N="362" REF="368">
Grey, Earl Cowper, the Dukes of Wharton, Bucking|ham,
and other peers. They affirmed it was calculated
for enriching a few and impoveri&s;hing a great number:
that it countenanced the fraudulent and pernicious prac|tice
of &s;tock-jobbing, which diverted the genius of the
people from trade and indu&s;try: that it would give fo|reigners
the opportunity to double and treble the va&s;t
&s;ums they had in the publick funds; and they would be
tempted to relea&s;e and withdraw their capital and immen&s;e
gains to other countries; &s;o that Great-Britain would be
drained of its gold and &s;ilver; that the artificial and pro|digious
ri&s;e of the South-Sea &s;tock was a dangerous
bait, which might decoy many unwary people $word$
ruin, alluring them by a fal&s;e pro&s;pect of $span$
with the fruits of their indu&s;try, to purcha&s;e $span$
riches: that the addition of above thirty millions $word$
would give &s;uch power to the South-Sea company, $word$
might endanger the liberties of the nation; for by their
exten&s;ive intere&s;t they would be able to influence mo&s;t, if
not all the elections of the members; and con&s;equently
over-rule the re&s;olutions of the Hou&s;e of Commons. Earl
Cowper urged that in all publick bargains the individuals
in the admini&s;tration ought to take care, that they &s;hall
be more advantageous to the &s;tate than to private per&s;ons;
but that a contrary method had been followed in the con|tract
made with the South-Sea company; for, &s;hould the
&s;tocks be kept at the advanced price to which they had
been rai&s;ed by the oblique arts of &s;tock-jobbing, either
that company or its principal members would gain above
thirty millions, of which no more than one fourth part
would be given towards the di&s;charge of the national debts.
He apprehended that the re-purcha&s;e of annuities would
meet with in&s;uperable difficulties; and, in &s;uch ca&s;e, none
but a few per&s;ons who were in the &s;ecret, who had bought
&s;tocks at a low rate, and afterwards &s;old them at a high
price would in the end be gainers by the project. The
Earl of Sunderland an&s;wered their objections. He de|clared
that tho&s;e who countenanced the &s;cheme of the
<PB N="363" REF="369">
South-Sea company, had nothing in view but the advan|tage
of the nation. He owned that the managers for that
company had undoubtedly a pro&s;pect of private gain,
either to them&s;elves or to their corporation; but, he &s;aid,
when the &s;cheme was accepted, neither the one nor the
other could fore&s;ee that the &s;tocks would have ri&s;en to
&s;uch a height: that if they had continued as they were,
the public would have had the far greater &s;hare of the ad|vantage
accruing from the &s;cheme; and &s;hould they be
kept up to the pre&s;ent high price, it was but rea&s;onable
that the South-Sea company &s;hould enjoy the profits pro|cured
to it by the wi&s;e management and indu&s;try of the
directors, which would enable it to make large dividends,
and thereby accompli&s;h the purpo&s;e of the &s;cheme. The
bill pa&s;&s;ed without amendment or divi&s;ion; and, on the
&s;eventh day of April, received the royal a&s;&s;ent. By this
act the South-Sea company was authori&s;ed to take in, by
purcha&s;e or &s;ub&s;cription, the irredeemable debts of the
nation, &s;tated at &s;ixteen millions five hundred forty-&s;ix
thou&s;and four hundred eighty-two pounds, &s;even &s;hillings,
one penny farthing, at &s;uch times as they &s;hould find con|venient
before the fir&s;t day of March of the en&s;uing year,
and without any compul&s;ion on any of the proprietors, at
&s;uch rates and prices as &s;hould be agreed upon between
the company and the re&s;pective proprietors. They were
likewi&s;e authori&s;ed to take in all the redeemable debts,
amounting to the &s;ame &s;um as that of the irredeemables,
either by purcha&s;e, by taking &s;ub&s;criptions, or by paying
off the creditors. For the liberty of taking in the na|tional
debts, and increa&s;ing their capital &s;tock accordingly,
the company con&s;ented that their pre&s;ent, and to be in|crea&s;ed
annuity, &s;hould be continued at five per cent. till
Mid&s;ummer, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and
twenty-&s;even; from thence to be reduced to four per cent.
and be redeemable by parliament. In con&s;ideration of this
and other advantages expre&s;&s;ed in the act, the company
declared them&s;elves willing to make &s;uch payments into
the receipt of the Exchequer as were &s;pecified for the
<PB N="364" REF="370">
u&s;e of the publick, to be applied to the di&s;charge of the
publick debts incurred before Chri&s;tmas, in the year one
thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;ixteen. The &s;ums they were
obliged to pay for the liberty of taking in the redeemable
debts, four years and a half's purcha&s;e for all the long
and &s;hort annuities that &s;hould be &s;ub&s;cribed and one
year's purcha&s;e for &s;uch long annuities as &s;hould not be
&s;ub&s;cribed, amounted on the execution of the act to about
&s;even millions. For enabling the company to rai&s;e this
&s;um, they were empowered to make calls for money from
their members; to open books of &s;ub&s;cription; to grant
annuities redeemable by the company; to borrow money
upon any contract or bill under their common &s;eal, or on
the credit of their capital &s;tock; to convert the money de|manded
of their members into additional &s;tock, without,
however, making any addition to the company's annuities,
payable out of the publick duties. It was enacted, That
out of the fir&s;t monies ari&s;ing from the &s;ums paid by the
company into the Exchequer, &s;uch publick debts, carrying
intere&s;t at five per cent. incurred before the twenty-fifth
day of December, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred
and &s;ixteen, founded upon any former act of parliament,
as were now redeemable, or might be redeemed before the
twenty-fifth day of December, in the year one thou&s;and
&s;even hundred and twenty-two, &s;hould be di&s;charged in
the fir&s;t place: that then all the remainder &s;hould be ap|plied
towards paying off &s;o much of the capital &s;tock of the
the company as &s;hould then carry an intere&s;t at five per
cent. It was likewi&s;e provided, that after Mid&s;ummer, in
the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and twenty-&s;even, the
company &s;hould not be paid off in any &s;ums being le&s;s than
one million at a time.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIII. The heads of the Royal-A&s;&s;urance and Lon|don-A&s;&s;urance
companies, under&s;tanding that the civil|li&s;t
was con&s;iderably in arrears, offered to the mini&s;try
&s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds towards the di&s;charge
of that debt, on condition of their obtaining the
King's charter, with a parliamentary &s;anction for the
<PB N="365" REF="371">
e&s;tabli&s;hment of their re&s;pective companies. The propo&s;al
was embraced; and the King communicated it in a me&s;|&s;age
to the Hou&s;e of Commons, de&s;iring their concurrence.
A bill was immediately pa&s;&s;ed, enabling his Maje&s;ty to
grant letters of incorporation to the two companies. It
&s;oon obtained the royal a&s;&s;ent; and, on the eleventh day
of June, an end was put to the &s;e&s;&s;ion. This was the age
of intere&s;ted projects, in&s;pired by a venal &s;pirit of adven|ture,
the natural con&s;equence of that avarice, fraud, and
profligacy, which the monied corporations had introduced.
This of all others is the mo&s;t unfavourable aera for an hi&s;to|rian.
A reader of &s;entiment and imagination cannot be
entertained or intere&s;ted by a dry detail of &s;uch tran&s;actions
as admit of no warmth, no colouring, no embelli&s;hment&mdash;
a detail which &s;erves only to exhibit an inanimate picture
of ta&s;tele&s;s vice and mean degeneracy.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIV. By this time an alliance offen&s;ive and de|fen&s;ive
was concluded at Stockholm between King
George and the Queen of Sweden, by which his Maje&s;ty
engaged to &s;end a fleet into the Baltick, to act again&s;t the
Czar of Mu&s;covy, in ca&s;e that monarch &s;hould reject rea|&s;onable
propo&s;als of peace. Peter loudly complained of the
in&s;olent interpo&s;ition of King George, alledging that he had
failed in his engagements, both as Elector of Hanover and
King of Great-Britain. His re&s;ident at London pre&s;ented
a long memorial on this &s;ubject, which was an&s;wered by
the Briti&s;h and Hanoverian mini&s;try. The&s;e recrimina|tions
&s;erved only to inflame the difference. The Czar
continued to pro&s;ecute the war; and at length concluded
a peace without a mediator. At the in&s;tances, however,
of King George, and the Regent of France, a treaty of
peace was &s;igned between the Queen of Sweden and the
King of Pru&s;&s;ia, to whom that prince&s;s ceded the city of
Stetin, the di&s;trict between the rivers Oder and Pehnne,
with the i&s;les of Wollin and U&s;edom. On the other hand,
he engaged to join the King of Great-Britain in his en|deavours
to effect a peace between Sweden and Denmark,
on condition that the Dani&s;h King &s;hould re&s;tore to Queen
<PB N="366" REF="372">
Ulrica that part of Pomerania which he had &s;ei&s;ed: he
likewi&s;e promi&s;ed to pay to that queen two millions of rix|dollars,
in con&s;ideration of the ce&s;&s;ions &s;he had made. The
treaty between Sweden and Denmark was &s;igned at Frede|rick&s;tadt
in the month of June, through the mediation of
the King of Great-Britain, who became guarantee for the
Dane's keeping po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Sle&s;wick. He con&s;ented, how|ever,
to re&s;tore the Upper Pomerania, the i&s;le of Rugen,
the city of Wi&s;mar, and whatever he had taken from Swe|den
during the war, in con&s;ideration of Sweden's renouncing
the exemption from toll in the Sound, and the two belts;
and paying to Denmark &s;ix hundred thou&s;and rixdol|lars.</P>
<P>&sect; XXV. Sir John Norris had again &s;ailed to the Baltick
with a &s;trong &s;quadron, to give weight to the King's me|diation.
When he arrived at Copenhagen he wrote a
letter to Prince Dolgorouki, the Czar's amba&s;&s;ador at the
court of Denmark, &s;ignifying that he and the King's envoy
at Stockholm were ve&s;ted with full powers to act jointly
or &s;eparately in quality of plenipotentiaries, in order to
effect a peace between Sweden and Mu&s;covy, in the way
of mediation. The Prince an&s;wered that the Czar had
nothing more at heart than peace and tranquillity; and,
in ca&s;e his Britannick Maje&s;ty had any propo&s;als to make
to that prince, he hoped the Admiral would excu&s;e him
from receiving them, as they might be delivered in a
much more compendious way. The Engli&s;h fleet im|mediately
joined that of Sweden as auxiliaries; but they
had no opportunity of acting again&s;t the Ru&s;&s;ian &s;quadron,
which &s;ecured it&s;elf in Revel. Ulrica, Queen of Sweden,
and &s;i&s;ter to Charles XII. had married the Prince of He&s;&s;e,
and was extremely de&s;irous that he &s;hould be joined with
her in the admini&s;tration of the regal power. She wrote
a &s;eparate letter to each of the four &s;tates, de&s;iring they
would confer on him the &s;overeignty; and, after &s;ome op|po&s;ition
from the nobles, he was actually elected King of
Sweden. He &s;ent one of his general officers to notify his
elevation to the Czar, who congratulated him upon his
<PB N="367" REF="373">
acce&s;&s;ion to the throne: this was the beginning of a nego|ciation
which ended in peace, and e&s;tabli&s;hed the tranquil|lity
of the North. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e tran&s;actions King
George &s;et out from England for his Hanoverian dominions;
but, before he departed from Great-Britain he was recon|ciled
to the Prince of Wales, through the endeavours of
the Duke of Devon&s;hire and Mr. Walpole, who, with Earl
Cowper, Lord Town&s;hend, Mr. Methuen, and Mr. Pul|teney,
were received into favour, and re-united with the
mini&s;try. The Earls of Dor&s;et and Bridgewater were pro|moted
to the title of dukes: Lord Vi&s;count Ca&s;tleton was
made an earl; Hugh Bo&s;cawen was created a baron, and
Vi&s;count Falmouth; and John Wallop, Baron and Vi&s;count
Lymington.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVI. While the King was involved at Hanover in
a labyrinth of negociations, the South-Sea &s;cheme pro|duced
a kind of national delirium in his Engli&s;h domini|ons.
Blunt, the projector, had taken the hint of his plan
from the famous Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi &s;cheme formed by Law, which
in the preceding year had rai&s;ed &s;uch a ferment in France,
and entailed ruin upon many thou&s;and families of that
kingdom. In the &s;cheme of Law, there was &s;omething
&s;ub&s;tantial. An exclu&s;ive trade to Loui&s;iana promi&s;ed
&s;ome advantage; though the de&s;ign was defeated by the
frantick eagerne&s;s of the people. Law him&s;elf became
the dupe of the Regent, who tran&s;ferred the burthen of
fifteen hundred millions of the King's debts to the &s;houl|ders
of the &s;ubjects; while the projector was &s;acrificed as
the &s;cape-goat of political iniquity. The South-Sea
&s;cheme promi&s;ed no commercial advantage of any con|&s;equence.
It was buoyed up by nothing but the folly and
rapaciou&s;ne&s;s of individuals, which became &s;o blind and
extravagant, that Blunt, with moderate talents, was able
to impo&s;e upon the whole nation, and make tools of the
other directors, to &s;erve his own purpo&s;es, and tho&s;e of a
few a&s;&s;ociates. When this projector found that the
South-Sea &s;tock did not ri&s;e according to his expectation
upon the bills being pa&s;&s;ed, he circulated a report, that
<PB N="368" REF="374">
Gibraltar and Port-Mahon would be exchanged for &s;ome
places in Peru; by which means the Engli&s;h trade to the
South-Sea would be protected and enlarged. This ru|mour,
diffu&s;ed by his emi&s;&s;aries, acted like a contagion.
In five days the directors opened their books for a &s;ub&s;crip|tion
of one million, at the rate of three hundred pounds
for every hundred pounds capital. Per&s;ons of all ranks
crouded to the hou&s;e in &s;uch a manner, that the fir&s;t &s;ub|&s;cription
exceeded two millions of original &s;tock. In a
few days this &s;tock advanced to three hundred and forty
pounds; and the &s;ub&s;criptions were &s;old for double the
price of the fir&s;t payment. Without entering into a detail
of the proceedings, or explaining the &s;candalous arts that
were practi&s;ed to enhance the value of the &s;tock, and
decoy the unwary, we &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that by the
promi&s;e of prodigious dividends, and other infamous arts,
the &s;tock was rai&s;ed to one thou&s;and; and the whole
nation infected with the &s;pirit of &s;tock-jobbing to an
a&s;toni&s;hing degree. All di&s;tinctions of party, religion,
&s;ex, character, and circum&s;tance, were &s;wallowed up in this
univer&s;al concern, or in &s;ome &s;uch pecuniary project.
Exchange alley was filled with a &s;trange concour&s;e of
&s;tate&s;men and clergymen, churchmen and di&s;&s;enters,
Whigs and Tories, phy&s;icians, lawyers, trade&s;men, and
even with multitudes of females. All other profe&s;&s;ions
and employments were utterly neglected; and the people's
attention wholly engro&s;&s;ed by this and other chimerical
&s;chemes, which were known by the denomination of
bubbles. New companies &s;tarted up every day, under
the countenance of the prime nobility. The Prince of
Wales was con&s;tituted governor of the Welch copper com|pany:
the Duke of Chandos appeared at the head of the
York-buildings company: the Duke of Bridgewater form|ed
a third, for building hou&s;es in London and We&s;tmin|&s;ter.
About a hundred &s;uch &s;chemes were projected and
put in execution, to the ruin of many thou&s;ands. The
&s;ums propo&s;ed to be rai&s;ed by the&s;e expedients amounted
to three hundred millions &s;terling, which exceeded the
<PB N="369" REF="375">
value of all the lands in England. The nation was &s;o in|toxicated
with the &s;pirit of adventure, that people became
a prey to the gro&s;&s;e&s;t delu&s;ion. An ob&s;cure projector, pre|tending
to have formed a very advantageous &s;cheme, which,
however, he did not explain, publi&s;hed propo&s;als for a &s;ub|&s;cription,
in which he promi&s;ed, that in one month $word$ par|ticulars
of his project &s;hould be di&s;clo&s;ed. In the mean
time, he declared that every per&s;on paying two guineas
&s;hould be entitled to a &s;ub&s;cription for one hundred pounds,
which would produce that &s;um yearly. In one forenoon
this adventurer received a thou&s;and of the&s;e &s;ub&s;criptions;
and in the evening &s;et out for another kingdom. The King,
before his departure, had i&s;&s;ued a proclamation again&s;t the&s;e
unlawful projects: the lords-ju&s;tices afterwards di&s;mi&s;&s;ed
all the petitions that had been pre&s;ented for charters and
patents; and the Prince of Wales renounced the company
of which he had been elected governor. The South-Sea
&s;cheme rai&s;ed &s;uch a flood of eager avidity and extravagant
hope, that the majority of the directors were &s;wept along
with it, even contrary to their own &s;en&s;e and inclina|tion;
but, Blunt and his accomplices &s;till directed the
&s;tream.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVII. The infatuation prevailed till the eighth
day of September, when the &s;tock began to fall. Then
did &s;ome of the adventurers awake from their delirium.
The number of the &s;ellers daily increa&s;ed. On the
twenty-ninth day of the month, the &s;tock had &s;unk to one
hundred and fifty: &s;everal eminent gold&s;miths and bankers,
who had lent great &s;ums upon it, were obliged to &s;top
payment, and ab&s;cond. The ebb of this portentous tide
was &s;o violent, that it bore down every thing in its way;
and an infinite number of families was overwhelmed with
ruin. Publick credit &s;u&s;tained a terrible &s;hock: the nation
was thrown into a dangerous &s;erment; and nothing was
heard but the ravings of grief, di&s;appointment, and de&s;pair.
Some principal members of the mini&s;try were deeply con|cerned
in the&s;e &s;raudulent tran&s;actions: when they &s;aw the
price of &s;tock &s;inking daily, they employed all their
<PB N="370" REF="376">
influence with the Bank to &s;upport the credit of the South-Sea
company. That corporation agreed, though with re|luctance,
to &s;ub&s;cribe into the &s;tock of the South-Sea com|pany,
valued at four hundred per cent. three millions five
hundred thou&s;and pounds, which the company was to repay
to the Bank on Lady-day and Michaelmas of the en&s;uing year.
This tran&s;action was managed by Mr. Robert Walpole,
who, with his own hand, wrote the minute of agreement,
afterwards known by the name of the Bank contract.
Books were opened at the Bank, to take in a &s;ub&s;cription for
the &s;upport of public credit; and con&s;iderable &s;ums of money
were brought in. By this expedient the &s;tock was rai&s;ed
at fir&s;t, and tho&s;e who contrived it &s;ei&s;ed the opportunity
to realize. But the bankruptcy of gold&s;miths and the
&s;word-blade company, from the fall of South-Sea &s;tock,
occa&s;ioned &s;uch a run upon the Bank, that the money was
paid away fa&s;ter than it could be received from the &s;ub|&s;cription.
Then the South-Sea &s;tock &s;unk again; and the
directors of the Bank, finding them&s;elves in danger of be|ing
involved in that company's ruin, renounced the agree|ment,
which, indeed, they were under no obligation to
perform, for it was drawn up in &s;uch a manner, as to be
no more than the rough draft of a &s;ub&s;equent agreement,
without due form, penalty, or clau&s;e of obligation. All
expedients having failed, and the clamours of the people
daily increa&s;ing, expre&s;&s;es were di&s;patched to Hanover, re|pre&s;enting
the &s;tate of the nation, and pre&s;&s;ing the King
to return. He accordingly &s;hortened his intended &s;tay in
Germany, and arrived in England on the eleventh day of
November.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVIII. The parliament being a&s;&s;embled on the
eighth day of December, his Maje&s;ty expre&s;&s;ed his con|cern
for the unhappy turn of affairs, which had &s;o deeply
affected the publick credit at home: he earne&s;tly de&s;ired
the Commons to con&s;ider of the mo&s;t effectual and &s;peedy
methods to re&s;tore the national credit, and &s;ix it upon a
la&s;ting e&s;tabli&s;hment. The Lower Hou&s;e was too much
intere&s;ted in the calamity, to po&s;tpone the con&s;ideration of
<PB N="371" REF="377">
that &s;ubject. The members &s;eemed to lay a&s;ide all party
di&s;tinctions, and vie with each other in promoting an en|quiry,
by which ju&s;tice might be done to the injured
nation. They ordered the directors to produce an account
of all their proceedings. Sir Jo&s;eph Jekyll moved, that a
&s;elect committe might be appointed, to examine the par|ticulars
of this tran&s;action. Mr. Walpole, now pay|ma&s;ter
of the forces, ob&s;erved, that &s;uch a method would
protract the enquiry, while the public credit lay in a bleed|ing
condition. He told the Hou&s;e he had formed a
&s;cheme for re&s;toring public credit; but, before he would
communicate this plan, de&s;ired to know whether the &s;ub|&s;criptions
of publick debts and incumbrances, money-&s;ub&s;criptions,
and other contracts made with the South-Sea
company, &s;hould remain in the pre&s;ent &s;tate. After a
warm debate, the que&s;tion was carried in the affirmative,
with this addition, &startq;Unle&s;s altered for the ea&s;e and re|lief
of the proprietors, by a general court of the South-Sea
company, or &s;et a&s;ide in due cour&s;e of law.&endq; Next
day Walpole produced his &s;cheme to engraft nine millions
of South-Sea &s;tock into the Bank of England, and the
like &s;um into the Ea&s;t-India company, on certain con|ditions.
The Hou&s;e voted, that propo&s;als &s;hould be re|ceived
from the Bank, and tho&s;e two companies, on this
&s;ubject. The&s;e being delivered, the Commons re&s;olved,
that an engro&s;&s;ment of nine millions of the capital &s;tock
of the South-Sea company, into the capital &s;tock of the
Bank and Ea&s;t-India company, as propo&s;ed by the&s;e com|panies,
would contribute very much to the re&s;toring pub|lic
credit. A bill upon this re&s;olution was brought in,
pa&s;&s;ed through both Hou&s;es, and received the royal-a&s;&s;ent.
Another bill was enacted into a law, for re&s;training the
&s;ub-governor, deputy-governor, directors, trea&s;urer, un|der-trea&s;urer,
ca&s;hier, &s;ecretary, and accountants, of the
South-Sea company, from quitting the kingdom, till
the end of the next &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament; and for di&s;|covering
their e&s;tates and effects, &s;o as to prevent them
from being tran&s;ported or alienated. A committee of
<PB N="372" REF="378">
&s;ecre&s;y was cho&s;en by ballot, to examine all the books, pa|pers,
and proceedings, relating to the execution of the South-Sea
act.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIX. The Lords were not le&s;s eager than the
Commons to pro&s;ecute this enquiry, though divers
members in both Hou&s;es were deeply involved in the guilt
and infamy of the tran&s;action. Earl Stanhope &s;aid the
e&s;tates of the criminals, whether directors or not directors,
ought to be confi&s;cated, to repair the publick lo&s;&s;es. He
was &s;econded by Lord Carteret, and even by the Earl of
Sunderland. The Duke of Wharton declared he would
give up the be&s;t friend he had, &s;hould he be &s;ound guilty.
He ob&s;erved, that the nation had been plundered in a mo&s;t
flagrant and notorious manner; therefore, they ought to
find out and puni&s;h the offenders &s;everely, without re&s;pect
of per&s;ons. The &s;ub and deputy governors, the directors
and officers of the South-Sea company, were examined at
the bar of the Hou&s;e. Then a bill was brought in, di&s;|abling
them to enjoy any office in that company, or in the
Ea&s;t-India company, or in the Bank of England. Three
brokers were likewi&s;e examined, and made great di&s;cove|ries.
Knight, the trea&s;urer of the South-Sea company,
who had been entru&s;ted with the &s;ecrets of the whole
affair, thought proper to withdraw him&s;elf from the king|dom.
A proclamation was i&s;&s;ued to apprehend him; and
another for preventing any of the directors from e&s;caping
out of the kingdom. At this period, the &s;ecret committee
informed the Hou&s;e of Commons, that they had already
di&s;covered a train of the deepe&s;t villainy and fraud that hell
ever contrived to ruin a nation, which in due time they
would lay before the Hou&s;e: in the mean while, they
thought it highly nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure the per&s;ons of &s;ome
of the directors and principal officers of the South-Sea
company, as well as to &s;ei&s;e their papers. An order was
made to &s;ecure the books and papers of Knight, Surman,
and Turner. The per&s;ons of Sir George Ca&s;wel, Sir
John Blunt, Sir John Lambert, Sir John Fellows, and
Mr. Grig&s;by, were taken into cu&s;tody. Sir Theodore
<PB N="373" REF="379">
Jan&s;en, Mr. Sawbridge, Sir Robert Chaplain, and Mr.
Eyles, were expelled the Hou&s;e, and apprehended. Mr.
Ai&s;labie re&s;igned his employments of chancellor of the Ex|chequer
and lord of the Trea&s;ury; and orders were given
to remove all directors of the South-Sea company from the
places they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed under the government.</P>
<P>&sect; XXX. The Lords, in the cour&s;e of their examination,
di&s;covered that large portions of South-Sea &s;tock had
been given to &s;everal per&s;ons in the admini&s;tration and
Hou&s;e of Commons, for promoting the pa&s;&s;age of the
South-Sea act. The Hou&s;e immediately re&s;olved, that
this practice was a notorious and mo&s;t dangerous &s;pecies
of corruption: that the directors of the South-Sea com|pany
having ordered great quantities of their &s;tock to be
bought for the &s;ervice of the company, when it was at a
very high price, and on pretence of keeping up the price
of &s;tock; and at the &s;ame time &s;everal of the directors,
and other officers belonging to the company, having, in a
clande&s;tine manner, &s;old their own &s;tock to the company,
&s;uch directors and officers were guilty of a notorious fraud
and breach of tru&s;t, and their &s;o doing was one great cau&s;e
of the unhappy turn of affairs, that had &s;o much affected
public credit. Many other re&s;olutions were taken again&s;t
that infamous confederacy, in which, however, the inno|cent
were confounded with the guilty. Sir John Blunt
refu&s;ing to an&s;wer certain interrogations, a violent debate
aro&s;e about the manner in which he &s;hould be treated.
The Duke of Wharton ob&s;erved, that the government of
the be&s;t princes was &s;ometimes rendered intolerable to their
&s;ubjects by bad mini&s;ters; he mentioned the example of
Sejanus, who had made a divi&s;ion in the Imperial family,
and rendered the reign of Claudius hateful to the Romans.
Earl Stanhope conceiving this reflection was aimed at him,
was &s;ei&s;ed with a tran&s;port of anger. He undertook to
vindicate the mini&s;try; and &s;poke with &s;uch vehemence
as produced a violent head-ach, which obliged him to re|tire.
He underwent proper evacuations, and &s;eemed to
recover: but next day, in the evening, became lethargick,
<PB N="374" REF="380">
and being &s;ei&s;ed with a &s;uffocation, in&s;tantly expired. The
King deeply regretted the death of this favourite mini&s;ter,
which was the more unfortunate, as it happened at &s;uch a
critical conjucture; and he appointed Lord Town&s;hend to
fill his place of &s;ecretary. Earl Stanhope was &s;urvived but a
few days by the other &s;ecretary, Mr. Craggs, who died of
the &s;mall-pox on the &s;ixteenth day of February. Knight,
the ca&s;hier of the South-Sea company, being &s;ei&s;ed at
Tirlemont, by the vigilance of Mr. Gandot, &s;ecretary to
Mr. Leathes, the Briti&s;h re&s;ident at Bru&s;&s;els, was confined
in the citadel of Antwerp. Application was made to the
court of Vienna, that he &s;hould be delivered up to &s;uch
per&s;ons as might be appointed to receive him: but he had
found means to intere&s;t the States of Brabant in his behalf.
They in&s;i&s;ted upon their privilege granted by charter, that
no per&s;on apprehended for any crime in Brabant &s;hould be
tried in any other country. The Hou&s;e of Commons ex|pre&s;&s;ed
their indignation at this frivolous pretence: in|&s;tances
were renewed to the Emperor; and in the mean
time Knight e&s;caped from the citadel of Antwerp.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXI. The committee of &s;ecre&s;y found, that, before
any &s;ub&s;cription could be made, a &s;ictitious &s;tock of five
hundred and &s;eventy-four thou&s;and pounds had been di&s;|po&s;ed
of by the directors, to facilitate the pa&s;&s;ing the
bill. Great part of this was di&s;tributed among the Earl
of Sunderland, Mr. Craggs &s;enior, the Duche&s;s of Kendal,
the Counte&s;s of Platen and her two nieces, Mr. Secretary
Craggs, and Mr. Ai&s;labie, chancellor of the Exchequer.
In con&s;equence of the committee's report, the Hou&s;e came
to &s;everal &s;evere though ju&s;t re&s;olutions again&s;t the di|rectors
and officers of the South-Sea company; and a bill
was prepared for the relief of the unhappy &s;ufferers. Mr.
Stanhope, one of the &s;ecretaries of the Trea&s;ury, charged
in the report with having large quantities of &s;tock and
&s;ub&s;criptions, de&s;ired that he might have an opportunity
to clear him&s;elf. His reque&s;t was granted; and the affair
being di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, he was cleared by a majority of three
<PB N="375" REF="381">
voices. Fifty thou&s;and pounds in &s;tock had been taken
by Knight for the u&s;e of the Earl of Sunderland. Great
part of the Hou&s;e entered eagerly into this enquiry; and
a violent di&s;pute en&s;ued. The whole &s;trength of the
mini&s;try was mu&s;tered in his defence. The majority de|clared
him innocent: the nation in general was of another
opinion. He re&s;igned his place of fir&s;t commi&s;&s;ioner in
the Trea&s;ury, which was be&s;towed upon Mr. Robert Wal|pole;
but he &s;till retained the confidence of his ma&s;ter.
With re&s;pect to Mr. Ai&s;labie, the evidence appeared &s;o
&s;trong again&s;t him, that the Commons re&s;olved, he had
promoted the de&s;tructive execution of the South-Sea
&s;cheme, with a view to his own exorbitant profit, and com|bined
with the directors in their pernicious practices, to
the ruin of publick credit. He was expelled the Hou&s;e,
and committed to the Tower. Mr. Craggs &s;enior died of
the lethargy, before he underwent the cen&s;ure of the Hou&s;e.
Neverthele&s;s, they re&s;olved that he was a notorious accom|plice
with Robert Knight, and &s;ome of the directors, in
carrying on their &s;candalous practices; and, therefore, that
all the e&s;tate of which he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, from the fir&s;t day
of December, in the preceding year, &s;hould be applied to|wards
the relief of the unhappy &s;ufferers in the South-Sea
company. The directors, in obedience to the order of
the Hou&s;e, delivered inventories of their e&s;tates,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oldmi$on.</NOTE> which
were confi&s;cated by act of parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Annals.</NOTE> towards making
good the damages &s;u&s;tained by the company,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi&s;t. Reg.</NOTE> after a cer|tain
allowance was deducted for each,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Polit. State.</NOTE> according to his
conduct and circum&s;tances.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deb. in Par.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tindal.</NOTE></P>
<P>&sect; XXXII.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1721.</NOTE> The delinqu$nts being thus puni&s;hed by the
forfeiture of their fortunes, the Hou&s;e converted their at|tention
to means for repairing the mi&s;chiefs which the
&s;cheme had produced. This was a very difficult ta&s;k, on
account of the contending intere&s;ts of tho&s;e engaged in the
South-Sea company, which rendered it impo&s;&s;ible to relieve
&s;ome but at the expen&s;e of others. Several whole&s;ome
re&s;olutions were taken, and pre&s;ented with an addre&s;s to
the King, explaining the motives of their proceedings.
<PB N="376" REF="382">
On the twenty-ninth day of July,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1721.</NOTE> the parliament was
prorogued for two days only. Then his Maje&s;ty going
to the Hou&s;e of Peers, declared that he had called them
together again &s;o &s;uddenly, that they might re&s;ume the
con&s;ideration of the &s;tate of publick credit. The Com|m$$s
immediately prepared a bill upon the re&s;olutions
they had taken. The whole capital &s;tock, at the end of
the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and twenty, amount|ed
to about thirty-&s;even millions eight hundred thou&s;and
pounds. The &s;tock allotted to all the proprietors did not
exceed twenty-four millions five hundred thou&s;and pounds:
the remaining capital &s;tock belonged to the company in
their corporate capacity. It was the profit ari&s;ing from
the execution of the South-Sea &s;cheme; and out of this
the bill enacted, that &s;even millions &s;hould be paid to the
publick. The pre&s;ent act likewi&s;e directed &s;everal addi|tions
to be made to the &s;tock of the proprietors, out of
that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the company in their own right: it made
a particular di&s;tribution of &s;tock, amounting to two mil|lions
two hundred thou&s;and pounds; and, upon remitting
five millions of the &s;even to be paid to the publick, an|nihilated
two millions of their capital. It was enacted,
that after the&s;e di&s;tributions, the remaining capital &s;tock
&s;hould be divided among all the proprietors. This divi|dend
amounted to thirty-three pounds &s;ix &s;hillings and
eight pence per cent. and deprived the company of eight
millions nine hundred thou&s;and pounds. They had lent
about eleven millions on &s;tock unredeemed; of which the
parliament di&s;charged all the debtors, upon their paying
ten per cent. Upon this article the company's lo&s;s ex|ceeded
&s;ix millions nine hundred thou&s;and pounds; for
many debtors refu&s;ed to make any payment. The pro|prietors
of the &s;tock loudly complained of their being de|prived
of two millions; and the parliament, in the &s;equel,
revived that &s;um which had been annihilated. While this
affair was in agitation petitions from counties, cities, and
boroughs, in all parts of the kingdom, were pre&s;ented to
the Hou&s;e, crying for ju&s;tice again&s;t the villainy of the
<PB N="377" REF="383">
directors.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. II. 1721.</NOTE> Pamphlets and papers were daily publi&s;hed on
the &s;ame &s;ubject; &s;o that the whole nation was exa&s;perated
to the highe&s;t pitch of re&s;entment. Neverthele&s;s, by the
wi&s;e and vigorous re&s;olutions of the parliament, the South-Sea
company was &s;oon in a condition to fulfil their engage|ments
with the publick: the ferment of the people &s;ub|&s;ided;
and the credit of the nation was re&s;tored.</P>

<P>&sect;. I. DURING the infatuation produced by this in|famous
&s;cheme, luxury, vice, and profligacy,
increa&s;ed to a &s;hocking degree of extravagance. The ad|venturers,
intoxicated by their imaginary wealth, pam|pered
them&s;elves with the rare&s;t dainties, and the mo&s;t
expen&s;ive wines that could be imported: they purcha&s;ed
the mo&s;t &s;umptuous furniture, equipage, and apparel,
though without ta&s;te or di&s;cernment: they indulged their
criminal pa&s;&s;ions to the mo&s;t &s;candalous exce&s;s: their
di&s;cour&s;e was the language of pride, in&s;olence, and the
mo&s;t ridiculous o&s;tentation: they affected to &s;coff at reli|gion
and morality; and even to &s;et heaven at defiance.
The Earl of Nottingham complained in the Hou&s;e of
Lords of the growth of athei&s;m, profanene&s;s, and im|morality;
and a bill was brought in for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing bla&s;|phemy
and profanene&s;s. It contained &s;everal articles
&s;eemingly calculated to re&s;train the liberty granted to non|conformi&s;ts
by the laws of the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion; for that rea&s;on
it met with violent oppo&s;ition. It was &s;upported by the
Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, the Earl of Nottingham,
Lords Bathur&s;t and Trevor, the Bi&s;hops of London, Win|che&s;ter,
and Lichfield and Coventry. One of the&s;e &s;aid he
verily believed the pre&s;ent calamity occa&s;ioned by the
South-Sea project was a judgment of God on the bla&s;|phemy
and profanene&s;s of the nation. Lord On&s;low re|plied,
&startq;That noble peer mu&s;t then be a great &s;inner, for
he has lo&s;t con&s;iderably by the South-&s;ea &s;cheme.&endq; The
Duke of Wharton, who had rendered him&s;elf famous by
his wit and pro$$igacy, &s;aid he was not in&s;en&s;ible of the
common opinion of the town concerning him&s;elf, and
gladly &s;ei&s;ed this opportunity of vindicating his character,
by declaring he was far from being a patron of bla&s;phemy,
or an enemy to religion. On the other hand, he could
not but oppo&s;e the bill, becau&s;e he conceived it to be
<PB N="380" REF="386">
repugnant to the holy &s;criptures. Then pulling an old fa|mily
bible from his pocket, he quoted &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages
from the epi&s;tles of St. Peter and St. Paul; concluding
with a de&s;ire that the bill might be thrown out. The
Earl of Peterborough declared, that though he was for a
parliamentary king, yet he did not de&s;ire to have a parlia|mentary
god, or a parliamentary religion; and, &s;hould
the Hou&s;e declare for one of this kind, he would go to
Rome, and endeavour to be cho&s;en a cardinal; for he had
rather &s;it in the conclave than with their lord&s;hips upon
tho&s;e terms. After a vehement debate, the bill was po&s;t|poned
to a long day, by a con&s;iderable majority.</P>
<P>&sect; II. The &s;ea&s;on was far advanced before the &s;upplies
were granted; and at length they were not voted with th$$
chearfulne&s;s and good humour which the majority $word$
therto manife&s;ted on &s;uch occa&s;ions. On the &s;ixteenth
day of June, the King &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the Hou&s;e of
Commons, importing, that he had agreed to pay a &s;ub&s;idy
to the crown of Sweden, and he hoped they would enable
him to make good his engagements. The leaders of the
oppo&s;ition took fire at this intimation. They de&s;ired to
know whether this &s;ub&s;idy, amounting to &s;eventy-two
thou&s;and pounds, was to be paid to Sweden over and above
the expen&s;e of maintaining a &s;trong &s;quadron in the Bal|$ick?
Lord Mole&s;worth ob&s;erved, that, by our late con|duct,
we were become the allies of the whole world, and
the bubbles of all our allies; for we were obliged to pay
them well for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He a$$irmed that the trea|ties
which had been made with Sweden, at different times,
were incon&s;i&s;tent and contradictory: that our late engage|ments
with that crown were contrary to the treaties &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting
with Denmark, and directly oppo&s;ite to the mea|&s;ures
formerly concerted with the Czar of Mu&s;covy. He
&s;aid, that, in order to engage the Czar to yield what he had
gained in the cour&s;e of the war, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia ought
to give up S$etin, and the Elector of Hanover re&s;tore
Bremen and Verden: that, after all, England had no bu|&s;ine&s;s
to intermeddle with the affairs of the empire: that
<PB N="381" REF="387">
we reaped little or no advantage by our trade to the Baltick,
but that of procuring naval &s;tores: he owned that hemp
was a very nece&s;&s;ary commodity, particularly at this junc|ture;
but he in&s;i&s;ted, that if due encouragement were
given to &s;ome of our plantations in America, we might
be &s;upplied from thence at a much cheaper rate than
from Sweden and Norway. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e argu|ments,
the Swedi&s;h &s;upply was granted; and, in about
three weeks, their complai&s;ance was put to another proof.
They were given to under&s;tand, by a &s;econd me&s;&s;age, that
the debts of the civil-li&s;t amounted to five hundred and
fifty thou&s;and pounds; and his Maje&s;ty hoped they would
empower him to rai&s;e that &s;um upon the revenue, as he
propo&s;ed it &s;hould be replaced to the civil-li&s;t, and re-em|bur&s;ed
by a deduction from the &s;alaries and wages of all
officers, as well as from the pen&s;ions and other payments
from the crown: A bill was prepared for this purpo&s;e,
though not without warm oppo&s;ition; and, at the &s;ame
time, an act pa&s;&s;ed for a general pardon. On the tenth
day of Augu&s;t, the King clo&s;ed the &s;e&s;&s;ion with a &s;peech,
in which he expre&s;&s;ed his concern for the &s;ufferings of
the innocent, and a ju&s;t indignation again&s;t the guilty,
with re&s;pect to the South-Sea &s;cheme. The&s;e profe&s;|&s;ions
were judged nece&s;&s;ary to clear his own character,
which had incurred the &s;u&s;picion of &s;ome people, who
whi&s;pered that he was not altogether free from connexions
with the projectors of that de&s;ign; that the Emperor had,
at his de&s;ire, refu&s;ed to deliver up Knight; and that he
favoured the directors and their accomplices.</P>
<P>&sect; III. Lords Town&s;h$nd and Carteret were now ap|pointed
&s;ecretaries of &s;tate; and the Earl of $$ay was
ve&s;ted with the office of lord privy-&s;eal of Scotland. In
June the treaty of peace between Great-Britain and
Spain was &s;igned at Madrid. The contracting$ parties
engaged to re&s;tore mutually all the effects &s;ei&s;ed and con|fi&s;cated
on both &s;ides. In particular, the King of England
promi&s;ed to re&s;tore all the &s;hips of the Spani&s;h fleet which
had been taken in the Mediterranean, or the value of
<PB N="382" REF="388">
them, if they were &s;old. He likewi&s;e promi&s;ed, in a
&s;ecret article, that he would no longer interfere in the
affairs of Italy; and the King of Spain made an ab&s;olute
ce&s;&s;ion of Gibraltar and Port-Mahon. At the &s;ame time,
a defen&s;ive alliance was concluded between Great-Britain,
France, and Spain. All remaining difficulties were re|ferred
to a congre&s;s at Cambray, where they hoped to
con&s;olidate a general peace, by determining all differences
between the Emperor and his Catholick Maje&s;ty. In the
mean time, the powers of Great-Britain, France, and Spain,
engaged, by virtue of the pre&s;ent treaty, to grant to the
Duke of Parma a particular protection for the pre&s;ervation
of his territories and rights, and for the &s;upport of his
dignity. It was al&s;o &s;tipulated, that the States-General
&s;hould be invited to accede to this alliance. The congre&s;s
at Cambray was opened: but the demands on both &s;ides
were &s;o high, that it proved ineffectual. In the mean
time, the peace between Ru&s;&s;ia and Sweden was con|cluded,
on condition that the Czar &s;hould retain Livonia,
Ingria, E&s;tonia, part of Carelia, and of the territory of
Wyburg, Riga, Revel, and Narva, in con&s;ideration of his
re&s;toring part of Finland, and paying two millions of rix-dollars
to the King of Sweden. The per&s;onal animo&s;ity
&s;ub&s;i&s;ting between King George and the Czar &s;eemed to
increa&s;e. Ba&s;tagif, the Ru&s;&s;ian re&s;ident at London, having
pre&s;ented a memorial that contained &s;ome unguarded ex|pre&s;&s;ions,
was ordered to quit the kingdom in a fortnight.
The Czar publi&s;hed a declaration at Peter&s;burgh, com|plaining
of this outrage, which, he &s;aid, ought naturally
to have engaged him to u&s;e repri&s;als; but, as he perceived
it was done without any regard to the concerns of Eng|land,
and only in favour of the Hanoverian intere&s;t, he
was unwilling that the Engli&s;h nation &s;hould &s;uffer for a
piece of inju&s;tice in which they had no &s;hare. He, there|fore,
granted to them all manner of &s;ecurity, and free
liberty to trade in all his dominions. To fini&s;h this &s;trange
ti&s;&s;ue of negociations, King George concluded a treaty
<PB N="383" REF="389">
with the Moors of Africk, again&s;t which the Spaniards
loudly exclaimed.</P>
<P>&sect; IV. In the cour&s;e of this year, Pope Clement XI.
died; and the Prince&s;s of Wales was delivered of a prince,
bapti&s;ed by the name of William-Augu&s;tus, the late
Duke of Cumberland. A dreadful plague raging at Mar|&s;eilles,
a proclamation was publi&s;hed, forbidding any
per&s;on to come into England, from any part of France be|tween
the bay of Bi&s;cay and Dunkirk, without certificates
of health. Other precautions were taken to guard again&s;t
contagion. An act of parliament had pa&s;&s;ed in the pre|ceding
&s;e&s;&s;ion, for the prevention of infection, by building
pe&s;t-hou&s;es, to which all infected per&s;ons, and all per&s;ons
of an infected family, &s;hould be conveyed; and, by draw|ing
trenches and lines round any city, town, or place in|fected.
The King, in his &s;peech at opening the &s;e&s;&s;ion
of parliament, on the nineteenth day of October, intimated
the pacification of the North, by the conclu&s;ion of the
treaty between Mu&s;covy and Sweden. He de&s;ired the
Hou&s;e of Commons to con&s;ider of means for ea&s;ing the
duties upon the imported commodities u&s;ed in the manu|factures
of the kingdom. He ob&s;erved, that the nation
might be &s;upplied with naval &s;tores from our own colo|nies
in North America; and that their being employed in
this u&s;eful and advantageous branch of commerce would
divert them from &s;etting up manufactures which directly
interfered with tho&s;e of Great-Britain. He expre&s;&s;ed a
de&s;ire that, with re&s;pect to the &s;upplies, his people might
reap &s;ome immediate benefit from the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances
of affairs, abroad; and the earne&s;tly recommended to their
con&s;ideration, means for preventing the plague, particularly
by providing again&s;t the practice of &s;muggling.</P>
<P>&sect; V. One of the fir&s;t objects that attracted the attention
of the Upper Hou&s;e was the oa&s;e of John Law, the famous
projector. The re&s;entment of the people on account of
his Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi &s;cheme had obliged him to leave France.
He retired to Italy; and was &s;aid to have vi&s;ited the Pre|tender
at Rome. From thence he repaired to Hanover;
<PB N="384" REF="390">
and returned to England from the Baltick, in the fleet
commanded by Sir John Norris. The King favoured
him with a private audience: he kept open hou&s;e, and
was vi&s;ited by great numbers of per&s;ons of the fir&s;t quality.
Earl Coning&s;by repre&s;ented, in the Hou&s;e of Lords, that
he could not but entertain &s;ome jealou&s;y of a per&s;on who
had done &s;o much mi&s;chief in a neighbouring kingdom;
who, being immen&s;ely rich, might do a great deal more
hurt here, by tampering with tho&s;e who were grown de|&s;perate,
in con&s;equence of being involved in the calamity
occa&s;ioned by the fatal imitation of his pernicious projects.
He ob&s;erved, that this per&s;on was the more dangerous, as
he had renounced his natural affection to his country, his
allegiance to his lawful &s;overeign, and his religion, by
turning Roman Catholick. Lord Carteret replied, that
Mr. Law had, many years ago, the misfortune to kill a
gentleman in a duel; but having at la&s;t received the benefit
of the King's clemency, and the appeal lodged by the re|lations
of the decea&s;ed being taken off, he was come over
to plead his Maje&s;ty's pardon. He &s;aid there was no law to
keep any Engli&s;hman out of his country; and, as Mr. Law
was a &s;ubject of Great-Britain, it was not even in the King's
power to hinder him from coming over. After &s;ome di&s;pute,
the &s;ubject was dropped, and this great projector pleaded
his pardon in the King's-Bench, according to the u&s;ual form.</P>
<P>&sect; VI. The mini&s;try had by this time &s;ecured &s;uch a
majority in both Hou&s;es, as enabled them to carry any
point without the lea&s;t difficulty. Some chiefs of the op|po&s;ition
they had brought over to their mea&s;ures, and
among the re&s;t Lord Harcourt, who was created a vi&s;count,
and gratified with a pen&s;ion of four thou&s;and pounds.
Neverthele&s;s, they could not &s;hut the mouths of the mi|nority,
who &s;till pre&s;erved the privilege of complaining.
Great debates were occa&s;ioned by the navy-debt, which
was increa&s;ed to one million &s;even hundred thou&s;and
pounds. Some members in both Hou&s;es affirmed that
&s;uch extraordinary expen&s;e could not be for the immediate
&s;ervice of Great-Britain; but, in all probability, for the
<PB N="385" REF="391">
pre&s;ervation of foreign acqui&s;itions. The mini&s;ters an|&s;wered,
that near two-thirds of the navy-debts were con|tracted
in the late reign; and the parliament acquie&s;ced
in this declaration: but, in reality, the navy debt had been
unnece&s;&s;arily increa&s;ed, by keeping &s;eamen in pay during
the winter, and &s;ending fleets to the Mediterranean and
Baltick, in order to &s;upport the intere&s;ts of Germany.
The Duke of Wharton moved that the treaty with Spain
might be laid before the Hou&s;e. The Earl of Sunderland
&s;aid it contained a &s;ecret article, which the King of Spain
de&s;ired might not be made publick, until after the treaty
of Cambray &s;hould be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. The que&s;tion was put,
and the Duke's motion rejected. The Earl of Strafford
a&s;&s;erted, that as the war with Spain had been undertaken
without nece&s;&s;ity or ju&s;t provocation, &s;o the peace was
concluded without any benefit or advantage: that, con|trary
to the law of nations, the Spani&s;h fleet had been
attacked without any declaration of war: even while a
Briti&s;h mini&s;ter and a &s;ecretary of &s;tate were treating ami|cably
at Madrid: that the war was neither ju&s;t nor poli|tick,
&s;ince it interrupted one of the mo&s;t valuable branches
of the Engli&s;h commerce, at a time when the nation
groaned under the pre&s;&s;ure of heavy debts, incurred by
the former long, expen&s;ive war. He, therefore, moved for
an addre&s;s to his Maje&s;ty, de&s;iring that the in&s;tructions
given to Sir George Byng, now Lord Torrington, &s;hould
be laid before the Hou&s;e. This motion being likewi&s;e,
upon the que&s;tion, rejected, a prote&s;t was entered. They
voted an addre&s;s, however, to know in what manner the
King had di&s;po&s;ed of the &s;hips taken from the Spaniards.
Di&s;putes aro&s;e al&s;o from the bill to prevent infection.
Earl Cowper repre&s;ented, that the removal of per&s;ons to
a Lazaret, or pe&s;t-hou&s;e, by order of the government,
and the drawing lines and trenches round places in|fected,
were powers unknown to the Briti&s;h con&s;titution;
incon&s;i&s;tent with the lenity of a free government; &s;uch as
could never be wi&s;ely or u&s;efully put in practice; the more
odious, becau&s;e copied from the arbitrary government of
<PB N="386" REF="392">
France; and impracticable, except by military compul&s;ion.
The&s;e obnoxious clau&s;es were accordingly repealed, though
not without great oppo&s;ition. Indeed, nothing can be
more ab&s;urd than a con&s;titution that will not admit of ju&s;t
and nece&s;&s;ary laws and regulations to prevent the dire con|&s;equences
of the wor&s;t of all calamities. Such re&s;trictions,
in&s;tead of favouring the lenity of a free government, would
be the mo&s;t cruel impo&s;ition that could be laid on a free
people, as it would act in diametrical oppo&s;ition to the
great principle of &s;ociety, which is the pre&s;ervation of the
individual.</P>
<P>&sect; VII. The Quakers having pre&s;ented a petition to the
Hou&s;e of Commons, praying that a bill might be brought
in for omitting in their &s;olemn affirmation the words &startq;In
the pre&s;ence of Almighty God,&endq; the Hou&s;e complied
with their reque&s;t: but the bill gave ri&s;e to a warm debate
among the peers. Dr. Atterbury, Bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter, &s;aid
he did not know why &s;uch a di&s;tingui&s;hing mark of indul|gence
&s;hould be allowed to a &s;et of people who were hardly
Chri&s;tians. He was &s;upported by the Archbi&s;hop of York,
the Earl of Strafford, and Lord North and Grey. A
petition was pre&s;ented again&s;t the bill by the London
clergy, who expre&s;&s;ed a &s;erious concern le&s;t the minds of
good men &s;hould be grieved and wounded, and the ene|mies
of Chri&s;tianity triumph, when they &s;hould &s;ee &s;uch
conde&s;cen&s;ion made by a chri&s;tian legi&s;lature to a &s;et of
men who renounce the divine in&s;titutions of Chri&s;t; par|ticularly
that by which the faithful are initiated into his
religion, and denominated Chri&s;tians. The petition,
though pre&s;ented by the Archbi&s;hop of York, was branded
by the mini&s;try as a &s;editious libel, and rejected by the
majority. Then, upon a motion by the Earl of Sunder|land,
the Hou&s;e re&s;olved, that &s;uch lords as might enter
prote&s;tations with rea&s;ons &s;hould do it before two o'clock
on the next &s;itting day, and &s;ign them before the Hou&s;e
ri&s;es.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Annals.</NOTE> The &s;upplies being granted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi&s;t. Reg.</NOTE> and the bu&s;ine&s;s of the

<PB N="387" REF="393">
In a few days it was di&s;&s;olved,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tindal.</NOTE> and another convoked by
proclamation. In the election of members for the new
parliament the mini&s;try exerted it&s;elf with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s,
as returned a great majority in the Hou&s;e of Commons,
extremely well adapted for all the purpo&s;es of an admini|&s;tration<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The Earl of Sunderland died in April, after having incurred a great load of popular odium, from his &s;uppo&s;ed connexions with the directors of the South Sea company. He was a mini&s;ter of abilities, but violent, impetuou$, and head&s;trong. His death was &s;oon followed by that of his father-in-law, the great Duke of Marlborough, who&s;e faculties had been for &s;ome time greatly impaired. He was interred in We&s;tmi&s;ter abbey, with &s;uch pro|fu&s;ion of tuneral pomp, as evinced the pride and o&s;tentation, much more than the ta&s;te and concern of tho&s;e who directed his ob&s;equies. He was &s;ucceeded as ma&s;ter of the Ordnance, and colonel of the fir&s;t regiment of foot-guards, by Earl Cadogan.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>&sect; VIII. In the beginning of May,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1722.</NOTE> the King is &s;aid to
have received of the Duke of Orleans full and certain in|formation
of a fre&s;h con&s;piracy formed again&s;t his per&s;on
and government. A camp was immediately formed in
Hyde-park. All military officers were ordered to repair
to their re&s;pective commands. Lieutenant-General Mac|cartney
was di&s;patched to Ireland, to bring over &s;ome
troops from that kingdom. Some &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons were
apprehended in Scotland: the &s;tates of Holland were de&s;ired
to have their auxiliary or guarantee troops in readine&s;s to
be embarked; and Colonel Churchill was &s;ent to the
court of France with a private commi&s;&s;ion. The appre|hen&s;ion
rai&s;ed by this &s;uppo&s;ed plot affected the publick
credit. South-Sea &s;tock began to fall; and crouds of
people called in their money from the Bank. Lord
Town&s;hend wrote a letter to the Mayor of London, by
the King's command, &s;ignifying his Maje&s;ty's having re|ceived
unque&s;tionable advices, that &s;everal of his &s;ubjects
had entered into a wicked con&s;piracy, in concert with
traitors abroad, for rai&s;ing a rebellion in favour of a popi&s;h
pretender; but that he was firmly a&s;&s;ured the authors of it
neither were nor would be &s;upported by any foreign power.
This letter was immediately an&s;wered by an affectionate
addre&s;s from the court of aldermen; and the example of
<PB N="388" REF="394">
London was followed by many other cities and boroughs.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1722.</NOTE>
The King had determined to vi&s;it Hanover, and actually
&s;ettled a regency, in which the Prince of Wales was not
included: but now this intended journey was laid a&s;ide:
the court was removed to Ken&s;ington, and the Prince re|tired
to Richmond. The Bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter having
been &s;ei&s;ed, with his papers, was examined before a com|mittee
of the council, who committed him to the Tower
for high-trea&s;on. The Earl of Orrery, Lord North
and Grey, Mr. Cochran, and Mr. Smith, from Scotland,
and Mr. Chri&s;topher Layer, a young gentleman of the
Temple, were confined in the &s;ame place. Mr. George
Kelly, an Iri&s;h clergyman, Mr. Robert Cotton of Hunt|ingdon&s;hire,
Mr. Bingley, Mr. Fleetwood, Neynoe, an
Iri&s;h Prie&s;t, and &s;everal per&s;ons, were taken into cu&s;tody;
and Mr. Shippen's hou&s;e was &s;earched. After Bi&s;hop
Atterbury had remained a fortnight in the Tower, Sir
Con&s;tantine Phipps pre&s;ented a petition to the court at
the Old-Bailey, in the name of Mrs. Morris, that prelate's
daughter, praying, that, in con&s;ideration of the Bi&s;hop's
ill &s;tate of health, he might be either brought to a &s;peedy
trial, bailed, or di&s;charged: but this was over-ruled.
The churchmen through the whole kingdom were filled
with indignation at the confinement of a bi&s;hop, which
they &s;aid was an outrage upon the church of England, and
the epi&s;copal order. Far from concealing their &s;entiments
on this &s;ubject, the clergy ventured to offer up publick
prayers for his health, in almo&s;t all the churches and
chapels of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter. In the mean time,
the King, attended by the Prince of Wales, made a &s;ummer
progre&s;s through the we&s;tern counties.</P>
<P>&sect; IX. The new parliament being a&s;&s;embled on
the ninth day of October, his Maje&s;ty made them ac|quainted
with the nature of the con&s;piracy. He &s;aid
the con&s;pirators had, by their emi&s;&s;aries, made the
&s;tronge&s;t in&s;tances for &s;uccours from foreign powers;
but were di&s;appointed in their expectations. That, never|thele&s;s,
con&s;iding in their numbers, they had re&s;olved
<PB N="389" REF="395">
once more,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. III. 1722.</NOTE> upon their own &s;trength, to attempt the &s;ub|ver&s;ion
of his government. He &s;aid they had provided
con&s;iderable &s;ums of money, engaged great numbers of
officers from abroad, &s;ecured large quantities of arms and
ammunition; and, had not the plot been timely di&s;cover|ed,
the whole nation, and particularly the city of Lon|don,
would have been involved in blood and confu&s;ion.
He expatiated upon the mildne&s;s and integrity of his own
government; and inveighed again&s;t the ingratitude, the
implacability, and madne&s;s of the di&s;affected, concluding
with an a&s;&s;urance, that he would &s;teadily adhere to the
con&s;titution in church and &s;tate, and continue to make the
laws of the realm the rule and mea&s;ure of all his actions.
Such addre&s;&s;es were pre&s;ented by both Hou&s;es as the fears
and attachment of the majority may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have
dictated on &s;uch an occa&s;ion. A bill was brought into
the Hou&s;e of Lords, for &s;u&s;pending the Habeas Corpus act
for a whole year: but they were far from being unanimous
in agreeing to &s;uch an unu&s;ual length of time. By this &s;u&s;|pen&s;ion,
they in effect ve&s;ted the mini&s;try with a dictatorial
power, over the liberties of the people.</P>
<P>&sect; X. The oppo&s;ition in the Hou&s;e of Commons was &s;o
violent, that Mr. Robert Walpole found it nece&s;&s;ary to
alarm their apprehen&s;ions by a dreadful &s;tory of a de&s;ign to
&s;ei&s;e the Bank and Exchequer, and to proclaim the Pre|tender
on the Royal Exchange. Their pa&s;&s;ions being
inflamed by this ridiculous artifice, they pa&s;&s;ed the bill, which
immediately received the royal a&s;&s;ent. The Duke of Nor|folk
being brought from Bath, was examined before the
council, and committed to the Tower, on &s;u&s;picion of
high-trea&s;on. On the &s;ixteenth day of November, the
King &s;ent to the Hou&s;e of Peers the original and printed
copy of a declaration &s;igned by the Pretender. It was
dated at Lucca, on the twentieth day of September, in
the pre&s;ent year, and appeared to be a propo&s;al addre&s;&s;ed to
the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain and Ireland, as well as to all
foreign princes and &s;tates. In this paper, the Chevalier
de St. George, having mentioned the late violations of the
<PB N="390" REF="396">
freedom of elections; con&s;piracies invented to give a colour
to new oppre&s;&s;ions; infamous informers; and the &s;tate of
pro&s;cription in which he &s;uppo&s;ed every hone&s;t man to
be, very gravely propo&s;ed, that if King George would re|linqui&s;h
to him the throne of Great-Britain, he would,
in return, be&s;tow upon him the title of king in his native
dominions, and invite all other &s;tates to confirm it: he
likewi&s;e promi&s;ed to leave to King George his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
to the Briti&s;h dominions &s;ecure, whenever, in due cour&s;e,
his natural right &s;hould take place. The Lords unani|mou&s;ly
re&s;olved, that this declaration was a fal&s;e, in&s;olent,
and traitorous libel; and ordered it to be burned at the
Royal Exchange. The Commons concurred in the&s;e
re&s;olutions. Both Hou&s;es joined in an addre&s;s, expre&s;&s;ing
their utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment and indignation at the &s;urpri&s;ing
in&s;olence of the Pretender; and a&s;&s;uring his Maje&s;ty,
they were determined to &s;upport his title to the crown
with their lives and fortunes. The Commons prepared a
bill for rai&s;ing one hundred thou&s;and pounds upon the real
and per&s;onal e&s;tates of all papi&s;ts, or per&s;ons educated in
the popi&s;h religion, towards defraying the expen&s;es oc|ca&s;ioned
by the late rebellion and di&s;orders. This bill,
though &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed by &s;ome moderate members, as
a &s;pecies of per&s;ecution, was &s;ent up to the Hou&s;e of Lords,
together with another, obliging all per&s;ons, being papi&s;ts,
in Scotland, and all per&s;ons in Great-Britain refu&s;ing and
neglecting to take the oaths appointed for the &s;ecurity of the
King's per&s;on and government, to regi&s;ter their names and
real e&s;tates. Both the&s;e bills pa&s;&s;ed through the Upper
Hou&s;e without amendments, and received the royal &s;anction.</P>
<P>&sect; XI. Mr. Layer being brought to his tryal at the
King's-Bench, on the twenty-fir&s;t day of November,
was convicted of having inli&s;ted men for the Pretender$
&s;ervice, in order to &s;tir up a rebellion, and received &s;en|tence
of death. He was reprieved for &s;ome time, and ex|amined
by a committee of the Hou&s;e of Commons: but
be either could not, nor would not, di&s;cover the particulars
of the con&s;piracy, &s;o that be &s;uffered death at Tyburn,
<PB N="391" REF="397">
and his head was fixed up at Temple-Bar. Mr. Pulteney,
chairman of the committee, reported to the Hou&s;e, that,
from the examination of Layer and others, a de&s;ign had
been formed by per&s;ons of figure and di&s;tinction at home,
in conjunction with traitors abroad, for placing the Pre|tender
on the throne of the&s;e realms: that their fir&s;t inten|tion
was to procure a body of foreign troops to invade the
kingdom at the time of the late elections; but that the con|&s;pirators
being di&s;appointed in this expectation, re&s;olved to
make an attempt at the time that it was generally believed
the King intended to go to Hanover, by the help of &s;uch
officers and &s;oldiers as could pa&s;s into England unob&s;erved,
from abroad, under the command of the late Duke of Or|mond,
who was to have landed in the river with a great
quantity of arms, provided in Spain for that purpo&s;e; at
which time the Tower was to have been &s;ei&s;ed. That this
&s;cheme being al&s;o defeated by the vigilance of the govern|ment,
they deferred their enterpri&s;e till the breaking up of
the camp; and, in the mean time, employed their agents
to corrupt and &s;educe the officers and &s;oldiers of the army:
that it appeared from &s;everal letters and circum&s;tances, that
the late Duke of Ormond, the Duke of Norfolk, the Earl
of Orrery, Lord North and Grey, and the Bi&s;hop of Ro|che&s;ter,
were concerned in this con&s;piracy, that their act|ing
agents were Chri&s;topher Layer and John Plunket, who
travelled together to Rome; Dennis Kelly, George Kelly,
and Thomas Carte, nonjuring clergymen, Neynoe, the
Iri&s;h prie&s;t, who by this time was drowned in the river
Thames, in attempting to make his e&s;cape from the me&s;|&s;enger's
hou&s;e, Mrs. Spilman, alias Yallop, and John
Sample.</P>
<P>&sect; XII. This pretended con&s;piracy, in all likelihood,
extended no farther than the fir&s;t rudiments of a de&s;ign
that was never dige&s;ted into any regular form; otherwi&s;e
the per&s;ons &s;aid to be concerned in it mu&s;t have been infa|tuated
to a degree of phrenzy: for they were charged with
having made application to the Regent of France, who
was well known to be intimately connected with the King
<PB N="392" REF="398">
of Great-Britain. The Hou&s;e of Commons, however,
re&s;olved, that it was a dete&s;table and horrid con&s;piracy
for rai&s;ing a rebellion, &s;ei&s;ing the Tower and the city of
London, laying violent hands upon the per&s;ons of his mo&s;t
&s;acred Maje&s;ty and the Prince of Wales, in order to &s;ub|vert
our pre&s;ent happy e&s;tabli&s;hment in church and &s;tate,
by placing a popi&s;h Pretender upon the throne: that it was
formed and carried on by per&s;ons of figure and di&s;tinction,
and their agents and in&s;truments, in conjunction with
traitors abroad. Bills were brought in, and pa&s;&s;ed, for
inflicting pains and penalties again&s;t John Plunket and
George Kelly, who were by the&s;e acts to be kept in clo&s;e
cu&s;tody, during his Maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure, in any pri&s;on in
Great-Britain; and that they &s;hould not attempt to e&s;cape
on pain of death, to be inflicted upon them and their a&s;&s;i&s;t|ants.
Mr. Yonge made a motion for a bill of the &s;ame
nature again&s;t the Bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter. This was immedi|ately
brought into the Hou&s;e, though Sir William Wynd|ham
affirmed there was no evidence again&s;t him but con|jectures
and hear&s;ays. The Bi&s;hop wrote a letter to the
Speaker,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Annals.</NOTE> importing, that though con&s;cious of his own
innocence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tindal.</NOTE> he &s;hould decline giving the Hou&s;e any trou|ble
that day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deb. in Par.</NOTE> contenting him&s;elf with the opportunity of
making his defence before another,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Polit. State.</NOTE> of which he had the
honour to be a member. Coun&s;el being heard for the
bill, it was committed to a grand committee on the &s;ixth
day of April, when the majority of the Tory members
quitted the Hou&s;e. It was then moved, that the Bi&s;hop
&s;hould be deprived of his office and benefice, and bani&s;hed
the kingdom for ever: Mr. Law&s;on and Mr. Oglethorp$
&s;poke in his favour.</P>
<P>&sect; XIII. The bill being pa&s;&s;ed and &s;ent up to the Lords
the Bi&s;hop was brought to his trial before them on the ninth
of May.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1723.</NOTE> Him&s;elf and his coun&s;el having been heard,
the Lords proceeded to con&s;ider the articles of the bill:
when they read it a third time, a motion was made to pa&s;s
it, and then a long and warm debate en&s;ued. Earl Paulet
demon&s;trated the danger and inju&s;tice of &s;werving in &s;uch
<PB N="393" REF="399">
an extraordinary manner from the fixed rules of evidence.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. III. 1723.</NOTE>
The Duke of Wharton, having &s;ummed up the depo&s;itions,
and proved the in&s;ufficiency of them, concluded with &s;ay|ing,
that let the con&s;equences be what they would, he
hoped &s;uch a helli&s;h &s;tain would never fully the lu&s;tre and
glory of that illu&s;trious Hou&s;e, as to condemn a man
without the lea&s;t evidence. Lord Bathur&s;t &s;poke again&s;t
the bill with equal &s;trength and eloquence. He &s;aid, if
&s;uch extraordinary proceedings were countenanced, he &s;aw
nothing remaining for him and others to do, but to retire
to their country hou&s;es, and there, if po&s;&s;ible, quietly
enjoy their e&s;tates within their own families, &s;ince the
lea&s;t corre&s;pondence, the lea&s;t intercepted letter, might he
made criminal. He ob&s;erved, that Cardinal Mazarin
boa&s;ted, that if he had but two lines of any man's
writing, he could, by means of a few circum&s;tances, at|te&s;ted
by witne&s;&s;es, deprive him of his life at his plea&s;ure.
Turning to the bench of bi&s;hops, who had been generally
unfavourable to Dr. Atterbury, he &s;aid he could hardly
account for the inveterate hatred and malice &s;ome per&s;ons
bore the learned and ingenious Bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter, unle&s;s
they were intoxicated with the infatuation of &s;ome &s;avage
Indians, who believed they inherited not only the &s;poils,
but even the abilities of any great enemy whom they
had killed in battle. The bill was &s;upported by the Duke
of Argyle, the Earl of Seafield, and Lord Lechmere, which
la&s;t was an&s;wered by Earl Cowper. This nobleman ob|&s;erved
that the &s;tronge&s;t argument urged in behalf of the
bill was nece&s;&s;ity; but that, for his part, he &s;aw no ne|ce&s;&s;ity
that could ju&s;tify &s;uch unprecedented and &s;uch
dangerous proceedings, as the con&s;piracy had above twelve
months before been happily di&s;covered, and the effects of
it prevented: that be&s;ides the intrin&s;ick weight and &s;trength
of the government, the hands of tho&s;e at the helm had
been &s;till further fortified by the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the Habeas
Corpus act, and the additional troops which had been
rai&s;ed. He &s;aid the known rules of evidence, as laid down
at fir&s;t, and e&s;tabli&s;hed by the law of the land, were the
<PB N="394" REF="400">
birthright of every &s;ubject in the nation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1723.</NOTE> and ought to be
con&s;tantly ob&s;erved, not only in the inferior courts of
judicature, but al&s;o in both Hou&s;es of parliament, till
altered by the legi&s;lature: that the admitting of the pre|carious
and uncertain evidence of the clerks of the po&s;t|office
was a very dangerous precedent. In former times
(&s;aid he) it was thought very grievous that in capital ca&s;es
a man &s;hould be affected by &s;imilitude of hands; but
here the ca&s;e is much wor&s;e, &s;ince it is allowed that the
clerks of the po&s;t-office &s;hould carry the &s;imilitude of
hands four months in their minds. He applauded the
Bi&s;hop's noble deportment, in declining to an&s;wer before
the Hou&s;e of Commons, who&s;e proceedings in this un|precedented
manner, again&s;t a lord of parliament, was &s;uch
an encroachment on the prerogative of the peerage, that if
they &s;ubmitted to it, by pa&s;&s;ing the bill, they might be term|ed
the la&s;t of Briti&s;h peers, for giving up their ancient pri|vileges.
The other party were not &s;o &s;ollicitous about an|&s;wering
rea&s;ons, as eager to put the que&s;tion, when the bill
pa&s;&s;ed, and a prote&s;t was entered. By this act the Bi&s;hop
was deprived of all offices, benefices, and dignities, and
rendered incapable of enjoying any for the future: he was
bani&s;hed the realm, and &s;ubjected to the pains of death in
ca&s;e he &s;hould return, as were all per&s;ons who &s;hould cor|re&s;pond
with him during his exile. Dr. Friend, the cele|brated
phy&s;ician, who was a member of the Hou&s;e, and
had exerted him&s;elf &s;trenuou&s;ly in behalf of the Bi&s;hop,
was now taken into cu&s;tody, on &s;u&s;picion of trea&s;onable
practices.</P>
<P>&sect; XIV. The next object that excited the re&s;entment of
the Commons was the &s;cheme of a lottery, to be drawn at
Harburgh, in the King's German dominions. The Hou&s;e
appointed a committee to enquire into this and other lot|teries
at that time on foot in London. The &s;cheme was
publi&s;hed, on preten&s;e of rai&s;ing a &s;ub&s;cription for main|taining
a trade between Great-Britain and the King's
territories on the Elbe: but it was a my&s;terious &s;eene of
iniquity, which the committee, with all their penetration,
<PB N="395" REF="401">
could not fully di&s;cover.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. III. 1723.</NOTE> They reported, however, that it
was an infamous, fraudulent undertaking, whereby many
unwary per&s;ons had been drawn in, to their great lo&s;s:
that their manner of carrying it on had been a manife&s;t
violation of the laws of the kingdom: That the managers
and agents of this lottery had, without any authority for
&s;o doing, made u&s;e of his Maje&s;ty's royal name, thereby
to give countenance to the infamous project, and induce
his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects to engage or be concerned therein.
A bill was brought in to &s;uppre&s;s this lottery; and to
oblige the managers of it to make re&s;titution of the money
they had received from the contributors. At the &s;ame
time the Hou&s;e re&s;olved, That John Lord Vi&s;count Bar|rington
had been notoriou&s;ly guilty of promoting, abet|ting,
and carrying on that fraudulent undertaking; for
which offence he &s;hould be expelled the Hou&s;e. The
court of Vienna having erected an Ea&s;t-India company at
O&s;tend, upon a &s;cheme formed by one Colebrook, an
Engli&s;h merchant, Sir Nathaniel Gould repre&s;ented to the
Hou&s;e of Commons the great detriment which the Engli&s;h
Ea&s;t-India company had already received, and were likely
further to &s;u&s;tain, by this O&s;tend company. The Hou&s;e
immediately re&s;olved, That for the &s;ubjects of this king|dom
to &s;ub&s;cribe, or be concerned in encouraging any
&s;ub&s;cription, to promote an Ea&s;t-India company now
erecting in the Au&s;trian Netherlands, was a high crime
and mi&s;demeanour; and a law was enacted for preventing
Briti&s;h &s;ubjects from engaging in that enterpri&s;e. By an|other
act relating to the South-Sea company, the two
millions of &s;tock which had been annihilated were revived,
added to the capital, and divided among the proprietors.
A third law pa&s;&s;ed, for the more effectual execution of
ju&s;tice in a part of Southwark, called the Mint, where a
great number of debtors had taken &s;anctuary, on the &s;up|po&s;ition
that it was a privileged place. On the twenty-&s;eventh
day of May the &s;e&s;&s;ion was clo&s;ed, with a &s;peech
that breathed nothing but panegyrick, acknowledgement,
<PB N="396" REF="402">
and affection to a parliament which had complied with all
his Maje&s;ty's wi&s;hes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1723.</NOTE></P>
<P>&sect; XV. His Maje&s;ty, having ennobled the &s;on of Mr.
Robert Walpole, in con&s;ideration of the father's &s;ervices,
made a good number of church promotions. He admitted
the impri&s;oned lords and gentlemen to bail; granted a
pardon to Lord Bolingbroke; and ordered the Bi&s;hop of
Roche&s;ter to be conveyed to the continent. Then he
him&s;elf &s;et out for Hanover, leaving the admini&s;tration of
his kingdoms in the hands of a regency, Lord Harcourt
being one of the ju&s;tices. The King was attended by the
two &s;ecretaries, Lords Town&s;hend and Carteret, who were
counted able negociators. The affairs of the continent
had begun to take a new turn. The intere&s;ts and con|nexions
of the different princes were become perplexed and
embarra&s;&s;ed; and King George re&s;olved to unravel them
by dint of negociation. Under&s;tanding that a treaty was
on the carpet between the Czar and the King of Sweden,
favourable to the Duke of Hol&s;tein's preten&s;ions to Sle&s;|wick,
the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of which the Elector of Hanover had
guaranteed to Denmark, his Maje&s;ty began to be in pain
for Bremen and Verden. The Regent of France and the
King of Spain had now compromi&s;ed all differences; and
their reconciliation was cemented by a double marriage
between Philip's &s;ons and the Regent's daughters. The
former propo&s;ed new treaties to England; but in&s;i&s;ted
upon the re&s;titution of Gibraltar and Port-Mahon, as well
as upon the King's openly declaring again&s;t the O&s;tend
company. His Britannick Maje&s;ty was apprehen&s;ive, that
&s;hould the Emperor be hard pre&s;&s;ed on that &s;ubject, he
might join the Czar and the King of Sweden, and promote
their de&s;igns in favour of the Duke of Hol&s;tein. On the
other hand, all the Italian powers exclaimed again&s;t the
treaty of London. The Pope had prote&s;ted again&s;t any
thing that might have been decided at Cambray to the
prejudice of his right. Memorials to the &s;ame effect had
been pre&s;ented by the King of Sardinia, the Dukes of
<PB N="397" REF="403">
Tu&s;cany, Parma, and Modena. France and Spain were in|clined
to &s;upport the&s;e potentates again&s;t the Hou&s;e of Au|&s;tria.
Europe &s;eemed to be on the eve of a new war. King
George was entangled in &s;uch a variety of treaties and inte|re&s;ts,
that he knew not well how to extricate him&s;elf from
the trouble&s;ome engagements he had contracted. By de|claring
for the Emperor, he mu&s;t have countenanced the
new e&s;tabli&s;hment at O&s;tend, which was &s;o prejudicial to
his Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, and incurred the re&s;entment of France,
Spain, and their allies of Italy. In renouncing the intere&s;t
of the Emperor, he would have expo&s;ed his German do|minions.
In vain he exhorted the Emperor to relax in his
di&s;putes with Spain, and give up the O&s;tend company,
which was &s;o detrimental and di&s;agreeable to his faithful
allies: the court of Vienna promi&s;ed in general to ob&s;erve
the treaties which it had concluded; but declined entering
into any particular di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; &s;o that all his Maje&s;ty's en|deavours
i&s;&s;ued in contracting clo&s;er connexions with Pru&s;&s;ia
and Denmark. All tho&s;e negociations carried on, all tho&s;e
treaties concluded by King George with almo&s;t every prince
and &s;tate in Chri&s;tendom, which &s;ucceeded one another &s;o
fa&s;t, and appear, at fir&s;t view, &s;o intricate and unaccount|able,
were founded upon two &s;imple and natural princi|ples,
namely, the de&s;ire of a&s;certaining his acqui&s;itions as
Elector of Hanover, and his re&s;olution to &s;ecure him&s;elf
again&s;t the di&s;affection of his Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, as well as the
efforts of the Pretender.</P>
<P>&sect; XVI. Great-Britain at this period enjoyed profound
tranquillity. Ireland was a little ruffled by an incident
which &s;eemed to have been mi&s;repre&s;ented to the people of
that kingdom. William Wood had obtained a patent
for furni&s;hing Ireland with copper currency, in which it
was deficient. A great clamour was rai&s;ed again&s;t this
coin. The parliament of that kingdom, which met in
September, re&s;olved, That it would be prejudicial to the
revenue, de&s;tructive of trade, and of dangerous con&s;e|quence
to the rights of the &s;ubject: that the patent had
<PB N="398" REF="404">
been obtained by mi&s;repre&s;entation: that the halfpence
wanted weight: that, even if the terms of the patent had
been complied with, there would have been a great lo&s;s to
the nation: that granting the power of coinage to a pri|vate
per&s;on had ever been highly prejudicial to the king|dom,
and would at all times be of dangerous con&s;equence.
Addre&s;&s;es from both Hou&s;es were pre&s;ented to the King
on this &s;ubject. The affair was referred to the lords of
the privy-council of England. They ju&s;tified the conduct
of the patentee, upon the report of Sir I&s;aac Newton and
other officers of the Mint, who had made the a&s;&s;ay and
trial of Wood's halfpence, and found he had complied
with the terms of the patent. They declared that this
currency exceeded in goodne&s;s, finene&s;s, and value of
metal, all the copper money which had been coined for
Ireland, in the reigns of King Charles II. King James II.
King William and Queen Mary. The privy-council
likewi&s;e demon&s;trated, that his Maje&s;ty's predece&s;&s;ors had
always exerci&s;ed the undoubted prerogative of granting
patents for copper coinage in Ireland to private per&s;ons:
that none of the&s;e patents had been &s;o beneficial to the
kingdom as this granted to William Wood, who had not
obtained it in an unprecedented manner, but after a re|ference
to the Attorney and Sollicitor General, and after
Sir I&s;aac Newton had been con&s;ulted in every particular&punc;
finally, they proved, by a great number of witne&s;&s;es, that
there was a real want of &s;uch money in Ireland. Notwith|&s;tanding
this deci&s;ion, the ferment of the Iri&s;h nation was
indu&s;triou&s;ly kept up by clamour, pamphlets, papers, and
lampoons, written by Dean Swift, and other authors; &s;o
that Wood voluntarily reduced his coinage from the value
of one hundred thou&s;and to that of forty thou&s;and pounds.
Thus the noi&s;e was &s;ilenced. The Commons of Ireland
pa&s;&s;ed an act for accepting the affirmation of the Quakers
in&s;tead of an oath; and voted three hundred and forty
thou&s;and pounds towards di&s;charging the debt of the na|tion,
which amounted to about double that &s;um.</P>
<P><PB N="399" REF="405">
&sect; XVII. In the month of October, England lo&s;t a worthy
nobleman in the death of Earl Cowper, who had twice di&s;|charged
the office of lord-chancellor, with equal di&s;cern|ment
and integrity. He was profoundly &s;killed in the laws
of his country; in his apprehen&s;ion quick and penetrating:
in his judgement clear and determinate. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a
manly eloquence: his manner was agreeable, and his de|portment
graceful. This year was likewi&s;e remarkable for
the death of the Duke of Orleans, Regent of France, who,
&s;ince the decea&s;e of Lewis XIV. had ruled that nation with
the mo&s;t ab&s;olute authority. He was a prince of ta&s;te and
&s;pirit, endowed with &s;hining talents for empire, which he
did not fail to di&s;play, even in the mid&s;t of effeminate pur|&s;uits
and idle debauchery. From the infirm con&s;titution of
the infant king, he had conceived hopes of a&s;cending the
throne, and taken his mea&s;ures accordingly: but the young
monarch's health began to be e&s;tabli&s;hed, and all the Duke's
&s;chemes were defeated by an apoplexy, of which he died,
in the fiftieth year of his age, after having nominated the
Duke of Bourbon as prime-mini&s;ter. King George imme|diately
received a&s;&s;urances of the good di&s;po&s;ition of the
French court, to cultivate and even improve the good un|der&s;tanding
&s;o happily e&s;tabli&s;hed between France and
Great-Britain. The King arrived in England on the
eighteenth day of December; and on the ninth day of Ja|nuary
the parliament was a&s;&s;embled. His Maje&s;ty, in his
&s;peech, recommended to the Commons the care of the pub|lick
debts; and he expre&s;&s;ed his &s;atisfaction at &s;eeing the
$inking fund improved and augmented, &s;o as to put the
debt of the nation into a method of being &s;peedily and
gradually di&s;charged.</P>
<P>&sect; XVIII. This was the repeated theory of patrioti&s;m,
which unhappily for the &s;ubjects was never reduced to
$ractice: not but that a beginning of &s;uch a laudable
work was made in this very &s;e&s;&s;ion, by an act for le&s;&s;ening
$e publick debts. This law provided, that the annuities
$t five per cent. charged on the general fund by a former
$ct, except &s;uch as had been &s;ub&s;cribed into the South-Sea,
<PB N="400" REF="406">
together with the unde&s;cribed blanks of the lottery in the
year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fourteen, &s;hould be
paid off at Lady-day of the year next en&s;uing, with the
money ari&s;ing from the &s;inking fund. The mini&s;try, how|ever,
did not per&s;evere in this path of prudent oeconomy.
The Commons granted all the &s;upplies that were demand|ed.
They voted ten thou&s;and &s;eamen; and the majority,
though not without violent oppo&s;ition, agreed to maintain
four thou&s;and additional troops, which had been rai&s;ed in
the preceding year; &s;o that the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the land
forces amounted to eighteen thou&s;and two hundred and
&s;ixty-four.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oldmixon. Polit. Stat. Hi&s;t. Reg. Annals of K. George. Mem. Hi&s;t. Tindal.</NOTE> The expen&s;e of the year was defrayed by a
land-tax and malt-tax. The Commons having di&s;patched
the &s;upply, took into con&s;ideration a grievance ari&s;ing from
protections granted by foreign mini&s;ters, peers, and mem|bers
of parliament, under which profligate per&s;ons u&s;ed to
&s;creen them&s;elves from the pro&s;ecution of their ju&s;t credi|tors.
The Commons re&s;olved, That all protections granted
by members of that Hou&s;e &s;hould be declared void, and
immediately withdrawn. The Lords made a declaration
to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, with an exception of menial &s;ervants,
and tho&s;e nece&s;&s;arily employed about the e&s;tates of peers<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>The Duke of Newca&s;tle was now appointed &s;ecretary of &s;tate; the Duke of Grafton, lord-chamberlain; and Lord Carteret, lord-lieutenant of Ireland.</P>

in which he exhorted him to cultivate the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin

through the whole monarchy of Spain; and the coun|cil

was now firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed on the neck of oppo&s;i|tion;
and commerce flouri&s;hed even under the load of
grievous impo&s;ition.</P>
<P>&sect; XX. The next parliament, which met on the twelfth
day of November, &s;eemed to be a&s;&s;embled for no other
purpo&s;e than that of e&s;tabli&s;hing funds for the expen&s;e of
the en&s;uing year: yet the &s;e&s;&s;ion was di&s;tingui&s;hed by a
remarkable incident; namely, the trial of the Earl of
Macclesfield, lord-chancellor of England. This nobleman
had connived at certain venal practices touching the &s;ale
of places, and the money of &s;uitors depo&s;ited with the
ma&s;ters of Chancery, &s;o as to incur the general reproach of
the nation. He found it nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;ign the great-&s;eal
in the beginning of January. On the ninth day of the
en&s;uing month, the King &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the Commons,
importing that his Maje&s;ty, having rea&s;on to apprehend
that the &s;uitors in the court of Chancery were in danger
of lo&s;ing a con&s;iderable &s;um of money, from the in&s;uffi|ciency
of &s;ome of the ma&s;ters, thought him&s;elf obliged in
ju&s;tice and compa&s;&s;ion to the &s;aid &s;ufferers to take the mo&s;t
&s;peedy and proper method the law would allow, for en|quiring
into the &s;tate of the ma&s;ters' accounts, and &s;ecuring
<PB N="402" REF="408">
their effects for the benefit of the &s;uitors;<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1724.</NOTE> and his Maje&s;ty
having had &s;everal reports laid before him, in pur&s;uance of
the directions he had given, had ordered the reports to be
communicated to the Hou&s;e, that they might have as full
and as perfect a view of this important affair as the &s;hort|ne&s;s
of the time, and the circum&s;tances and nature of the
proceedings would admit.</P>
<P>&sect; XXI. The&s;e papers being taken into con&s;ideration,
Sir George Oxenden ob&s;erved, that enormous abu&s;es had
crept into the high court of Chancery: that the crimes
and mi&s;demeanours of the late Lord-Chancellor were many
and various, but might be reduced to the following heads:
that he had embezzled the e&s;tates and effects of many
widows, orphans, and lunaticks: that he had rai&s;ed the
offices of ma&s;ters in Chancery to an exorbitant price:
tru&s;ting in their hands large &s;ums of money belonging to
&s;uitors, that they might be enabled to comply with his
exorbitant demands; and that in &s;everal ca&s;es he had made
divers irregular orders. He, therefore, moved, That Tho|mas
Earl of Macclesfield &s;hould be impeached of high
crimes and mi&s;demeanours. Mr. Pulteney moved, That
this affair might be left to the con&s;ideration of a &s;elect
committee.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Annals. Mem. Hi&s;t. Deb. in Par. Tindal.</NOTE> Sir William Wyndham a&s;&s;erted, that in pro|ceeding
by way of impeachment upon reports from above,
they would make a dangerous precedent; and &s;eem to give
up the mo&s;t valuable of their privileges, the inque&s;t after
&s;tate criminals. The que&s;tion being put, it was carried
for the impeachment. The Earl was accordingly im|peached
at the bar of the Upper-Hou&s;e; a committee was
appointed to prepare articles; and a bill was brought in, to
indemnify the ma&s;ters in Chancery from the penalties of
the law, upon di&s;covering what con&s;iderations they had
paid for their admi&s;&s;ion to their re&s;pective offices. The
trial la&s;ted twenty days;<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1725.</NOTE> the Earl was convicted of frau|dulent
practices; and condemned in a fine of thirty thou|&s;and
pounds, with impri&s;onment until that &s;um &s;hould be
paid. He was immediately committed to the Tower,
where he continued about &s;ix weeks; but upon producing
<PB N="403" REF="409">
the money he was di&s;charged; and Sir Peter King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. III. 1725.</NOTE> now
created Baron of Oakham, &s;ucceeded him in the office of
chancellor.</P>
<P>&sect; XXII. His Maje&s;ty, on the eighth day of April, gave
the Hou&s;e of Commons to under&s;tand, that having been
engaged in &s;ome extraordinary expen&s;es, he hoped he
&s;hould be enabled to rai&s;e a &s;um of money, by making u&s;e
of the funds lately e&s;tabli&s;hed for the payment of the civil|li&s;t
annuities, in order to di&s;charge the debts contracted in
his civil government. Mr. Pulteney, cofferer of the hou&s;e|hold,
moved for an addre&s;s, That an account &s;hould be
laid before the Hou&s;e of all monies paid for &s;ecret-&s;ervice,
pen&s;ions, and bounties, from the twenty-fifth day of March,
in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and one, to the
twenty-fifth of the &s;ame month in the pre&s;ent year. This
addre&s;s being voted, a motion was made to con&s;ider the
King's me&s;&s;age. Mr. Pulteney urged, that this con&s;idera|tion
&s;hould be po&s;tponed until the hou&s;e &s;hould have exa|mined
the papers that were the &s;ubject of the addre&s;s. He
expre&s;&s;ed his &s;urpri&s;e that a debt amounting to above five
hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;hould be contracted in three
years: he &s;aid he did not wonder that &s;ome per&s;ons &s;hould
be &s;o eager to make good the deficiencies of the civil-li&s;t,
&s;ince they and their friends enjoyed &s;uch a &s;hare of that re|venue;
and he de&s;ired to know, whether this was all that
was due, or whether they &s;hould expect another reckon|ing?
This gentleman began to be di&s;&s;atisfied with the
mea&s;ures of the mini&s;try; and his &s;arca&s;ms were aimed at
Mr. Walpole, who undertook to an&s;wer his objections.
The Commons took the me&s;&s;age into con&s;ideration, and
pa&s;&s;ed a bill, enabling his Maje&s;ty to rai&s;e any &s;um, not
exceeding one million, by Exchequer-Bills, loans, or other|wi&s;e,
on the credit of the deductions of &s;ix-pence per
pound, directed by an act of parliament of the &s;eventh year
of his Maje&s;ty, and of the civil-li&s;t revenues, at an intere&s;t
not exceeding three pounds per cent. till repayment of the
principal.</P>
<P><PB N="404" REF="410">
&sect; XXIII. On the twentieth day of April,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1725.</NOTE> a petition was
pre&s;ented to the Hou&s;e by Lord Finch, in behalf of Henry
St. John, late Vi&s;count Bolingbroke, praying that the exe|cution
of the law with re&s;pect to his forefeitures might be
&s;u&s;pended, as a pardon had &s;u&s;pended it with re&s;pect to his
life. Mr. Walpole &s;ignified to the Hou&s;e, by his Maje&s;ty's
command, that &s;even years before, the petitioner had made
his humble application and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the King, with
a&s;&s;urances of duty, allegiance, and fidelity; that from his
behaviour &s;ince that time, his Maje&s;ty was convinced of
his being a fit object of his mercy; and con&s;ented to his pe|titioning
the Hou&s;e. The petition being read, Mr. Wal|pole
declared him&s;elf fully &s;atisfied, that the petitioner had
&s;ufficiently atoned for his pa&s;t offences; and therefore de|&s;erved
the favour of that Hou&s;e, &s;o far as to enable him to
enjoy the family inheritance that was &s;ettled upon him,
which he could not do by virtue of his Maje&s;ty's pardon,
without an act of parliament. Lord Finch moved, That a
bill might be brought in for this purpo&s;e, and was warmly
oppo&s;ed by Mr. Methuen, comptroller of the hou&s;ehold,
who repre&s;ented Bolingbroke as a mon&s;ter of iniquity. His
remon&s;trance was &s;upported by Lord William Paulet and
Mr. On&s;low; neverthele&s;s, the bill was prepared, pa&s;&s;ed
through both Hou&s;es, and received the royal a&s;&s;ent. An act
being pa&s;&s;ed for di&s;arming the Highlanders of Scotland; ano|ther
for regulating elections within the city of London; a
third for reducing the intere&s;t of &s;everal Bank annuities, to|gether
with &s;ome bills of a private nature, the parliament
was prorogued in May, after the King had, in the warme&s;t
terms of acknowledgment<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>On the fifth Day of December the Prince&s;s of Wales was delivered of a prince&s;s, chri&s;tened by the name of Loui&s;a, and afterwards married to the King of Denmark.

<PB N="405" REF="411">
their conduct. Then he appointed lords-ju&s;tices to govern
the nation in his ab&s;ence; and &s;et out in June for his Ger|man
dominions.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIV. The tide of political intere&s;ts on the continent
had begun to flow in a new channel, &s;o as to render inef|fectual
the mounds which his Britannick Maje&s;ty had rai&s;ed
by his multiplicity of negociations. Louis, the Spani&s;h mo|narch,
dying &s;oon after his elevation to the throne, his father
Philip re&s;umed the crown which he had re&s;igned; and gave
him&s;elf up implicitly to the conduct of his queen, who was
a prince&s;s of indefatigable intrigue and in&s;atiate ambition.
The Infanta, who had been married to Louis XV. of
France, was &s;o di&s;agreeable to her hu&s;band, that the whole
French nation began to be apprehen&s;ive of a civil war, in
con&s;equence of his dying without male i&s;&s;ue; he therefore
determined, with the advice of his council, to &s;end back the
Infanta, as the nuptials had not been con&s;ummated; and
&s;he was attended to Madrid by the Marquis de Monteleone.
The Queen of Spain re&s;ented this in&s;ult offered to her
daughter; and, in revenge, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed Mademoi&s;elle de
Beaujolois, one of the Regent's daughters, who had been
betrothed to her &s;on Don Carlos. As the congre&s;s at
Cambray had proved ineffectual, &s;he offered to adju&s;t her
differences with the Emperor, under the &s;ole mediation of
Great-Britain. This was an honour which King George
declined. He was aver&s;e to any undertaking that might
interrupt the harmony &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between him and the
court of Ver&s;ailles; and he had taken umbrage at the Em|peror's
refu&s;ing to grant the inve&s;titure of Bremen and
Verden, except upon terms which he did not choo&s;e to
embrace. The peace between the courts of Vienna and
Madrid, which he refu&s;ed to mediate, was effected by a
private negociation, under the management of the Duke
de Ripperda, a native of the States-General, who had re|nounced
the prote&s;tant religion, and entered into the &s;er|vice
of his Catholick Maje&s;ty. By two treaties, &s;igned at
Vienna in the month of April, the Emperor acknowledged
<PB N="406" REF="412">
Philip as King of Spain and the Indies, promi&s;ing that he
would not mole&s;t him in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e dominions
that were &s;ecured to him by the treaty of Utrecht. Philip
renounced all preten&s;ions to the dominions in Italy and the
Netherlands, adjudged to the Emperor by the treaty of
London: Charles granted the inve&s;titure of the dukedom$
of Tu&s;cany, Parma, and Placentia to the elde&s;t &s;on of
the Queen of Spain, in default of heirs in the pre&s;ent
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, as ma&s;culine fiefs of the empire. Spain became
guarantee of the Au&s;trian &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, according to the
pragmatick &s;anction, by which the dominions of that
hou&s;e were &s;ettled on the Emperor's heirs general, and de|clared
to be perpetual, indivi&s;ible, and in&s;eparable feoff|ment
to the primogeniture. By the commercial treaty of
Vienna, the Au&s;trian &s;ubjects were entitled to advantages
in trade with Spain, which no other nation enjoyed. His
Catholick Maje&s;ty guaranteed the O&s;tend Ea&s;t-India com|pany;
and agreed to pay an annual &s;ub&s;idy of four mil|lions
of pia&s;tres to the Emperor. Great &s;ums were re|mitted
to Vienna; the Imperial forces were augmented
to a formidable number; and other powers were &s;ollicited
to engage in this alliance, to which the court of Peter&s;burgh
actually acceded.</P>
<P>&sect; XXV. The King of Great-Britain took the alarm.
The Emperor and he had for &s;ome time treated each other
with manife&s;t coldne&s;s. He had rea&s;on to fear &s;ome at|tempt
upon his German dominions; and projected a de|fen&s;ive
treaty with France and Pru&s;&s;ia. This alliance,
limited to the term of fifteen years, was negociated and
concluded at Hanover, in the month of September. It
implied a mutual guarantee of the dominions po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by
the contracting parties, their rights and privileges, tho&s;e
of commerce in particular, and an engagement to procure
&s;atisfaction to the prote&s;tants of Thorn, who had lately
been oppre&s;&s;ed by the Catholicks, contrary to the treaty of
Oliva. The King having taken the&s;e precautions at
Hanover, &s;et out on his return for England; embarked
at Helvoet&s;luya in the middle of December; and after
<PB N="407" REF="413">
having been expo&s;ed to the fury of a dreadful &s;torm, was
landed with great difficulty at Rye, from whence he pro|ceeded
by land to London. The parliament meeting on
the twentieth day of the next month, he gave them to
under&s;tand, that the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed condition of &s;ome of their
prote&s;tant brethren abroad, and the negociations and en|gagements
contracted by &s;ome foreign powers, which &s;eem|ed
to have laid the foundation of new troubles and di&s;tur|bances
in Europe, and to threaten his &s;ubjects with the
lo&s;s of &s;everal of the mo&s;t advantageous branches of their
trade, had obliged him to concert with other powers &s;uch
mea&s;ures as might give a check to the ambitious views of
tho&s;e who were endeavouring to render them&s;elves formi|dable;
and put a &s;top to the further progre&s;s of &s;uch dan|gerous
de&s;igns. He told them, that the enemies of his
government were already very bu&s;y, by their in&s;truments
and emi&s;&s;aries in tho&s;e courts who&s;e mea&s;ures &s;eemed mo&s;t
to favour their purpo&s;es, in &s;olliciting and promoting the
cau&s;e of the Pretender. One &s;ees, at fir&s;t &s;ight, that the
intere&s;ts of Germany dictated the treaty of Hanover; but,
in order to &s;ecure the approbation of Great-Britain, upon
which the &s;upport of this alliance chiefly depended, it was
judged nece&s;&s;ary to in&s;ert the articles relating to commerce
and the prote&s;tant religion, as if the engagement had been
contracted purely for the advantage and glory of England.
In a word, the mini&s;try began now to ring the changes
upon a few words that have been repeated ever &s;ince, like
cabali&s;tical &s;ounds, by which the nation has been enchanted
into a very dangerous connexion with the concerns of the
continent. They harangued, they in&s;i&s;ted upon the
machinations of the di&s;affected, the de&s;igns of a popi&s;h
Pretender, the prote&s;tant intere&s;t, and the balance of
power, until the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions became ab&s;olutely terms of
ridicule with every per&s;on of common &s;en&s;e and reflexion.
The people were told, that the Emperor and the King of
Spain, exclu&s;ive of the publick treaties concluded at
Vienna, had entered into private engagements, importing,
that the Imperiali&s;ts &s;hould join the Spaniards in recovering
<PB N="408" REF="414">
Gibraltar and Port-Mahon by force of arms, in ca&s;e the
King of England &s;hould refu&s;e to re&s;tore them amicably,
according to a &s;olemn promi&s;e he had made: that a double
marriage &s;hould take place between the two Infants of
Spain, and the two Archduche&s;&s;es of Au&s;tria; and that
means &s;hould be taken to place the Pretender on the throne
of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVI. When the treaties of Vienna and Hanover
fell under con&s;ideration of the Hou&s;e of Commons, Horatio
Walpole, afterwards termed, in deri&s;ion, &startq;the balance-ma&s;ter,&endq;
opened the debate with a long, unanimated
oration, giving a detail of the affairs of Europe &s;ince the
treaty of Utrecht. He enumerated the barrier-treaty, the
convention for executing that treaty, the defen&s;ive alliance
with the Emperor, the other with the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King
and the States-General, another convention, the quadruple
alliance, the congre&s;s at Cambray, the treaty of Hanover,
and that of Vienna. He explained the nature of each en|gagement.
He &s;aid, the main de&s;ign of the treaty of com|merce
concluded between the Emperor and Spain, was to
countenance and &s;upport the Ea&s;t-India company e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
at O&s;tend, which interfered &s;o e&s;&s;entially with the
Ea&s;t-India companies of England and Holland, and was
directly contrary to &s;everal &s;olemn treaties &s;till in force.
He enlarged upon the danger to which the balance of
power would be expo&s;ed, &s;hould the i&s;&s;ue-male of this
projected marriage between the hou&s;es of Au&s;tria and Spain
ever po&s;&s;e&s;s the Imperial dignity and the kingdom of Spain
together. The reader will take notice, that this very man
was one of tho&s;e who exclaimed again&s;t that article of the
treaty of Utrecht, which prevented the power of tho&s;e two
hou&s;es from being immediately united in the per&s;on of the
Emperor. He did not $orget to expatiate upon the pre|tended
&s;ecret engagement concerning Gibraltar and Mi|norca;
and the King's pious concern for the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed
prote&s;tants of Thorn in Poland. In vain did Mr. Shippen
urge, that the treaty of Hanover would engage the Briti&s;h
nation in a war for the defence of the King's German do|minions,
<PB N="409" REF="415">
contrary to an expre&s;s provi&s;ion made in the act
of limitation. The&s;e arguments had lo&s;t all weight. The
oppo&s;ition was &s;o incon&s;iderable, that the mini&s;try had no
rea&s;on to be in pain about any mea&s;ure they &s;hould propo&s;e.
An addre&s;s was voted and delivered to his Maje&s;ty, approv|ing
the alliance he had concluded at Hanover, in order to
obviate and di&s;appoint the dangerous views and con&s;e|quences
of the treaty of peace betwixt the Emperor and the
King of Spain; and promi&s;ing to &s;upport his Maje&s;ty again&s;t
all in&s;ults and attacks that &s;hould be made upon any of his
territories, though not belonging to the crown of Great-Britain.
An addre&s;s of the &s;ame kind was pre&s;ented by
the Hou&s;e of Lords in a body. A bill was brought in,
empowering the commi&s;&s;ioners of the Trea&s;ury to compound
with Mr. Richard Hampden, late trea&s;urer of the navy, for
a debt he owed to the crown, amounting to eight-and-forty
thou&s;and pounds. This deficiency was occa&s;ioned
by his embarking in the South-Sea &s;cheme. The King
recommended his petition; and the Hou&s;e complied with
his reque&s;t, in con&s;ideration of his great grandfather, the
famous John Hampden, who made &s;uch a noble &s;tand
again&s;t the arbitrary mea&s;ures of the fir&s;t Charles.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVII. The malt-tax was found &s;o grievous to
Scotland, that the people refu&s;ed to pay it, and riots were
excited in different part of the kingdom. At Gla&s;gow,
the populace, armed with clubs and &s;taves, ri&s;led the hou&s;e
of Daniel Campbell, their repre&s;entative in parliament, who
had voted for the bill; and maltreated &s;ome exci&s;emen, who
attempted to take an account of the malt. General Wade,
who commanded the forces in Scotland, had &s;ent two
companies of &s;oldiers, under the command of Captain
Bu&s;hel, to prevent or appea&s;e any di&s;turbance of this nature.
That officer drew up his men in the &s;treet, where they
were pelted with &s;tones by the multitude, which he en|deavoured
to di&s;per&s;e, by &s;iring among them without &s;hot.
This expedient failing, he ordered his men to load their
pieces with ball, and at a time when the magi&s;trates were
advancing towards him in a body, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him with their
<PB N="410" REF="416">
advice and influence, he commanded the &s;oldiers to fire
four different ways, without the &s;anction of the civil au|thority.
Above twenty per&s;ons were killed or wounded on
this occa&s;ion. The people &s;eeing &s;o many victims fall,
were exa&s;perated beyond all &s;en&s;e of danger. They began
to procure arms, and breathed nothing but defiance and re|venge.
Bu&s;hel thought proper to retreat to the ca&s;tle of
Dumbarton; and was pur&s;ued above five miles by the en|raged
multitude. General Wade being informed of this
tran&s;action, a&s;&s;embled a body of forces; and being accom|panied
by Duncan Forbes, lord-advocate, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of Gla&s;gow.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oldmixon. Annals. Deb. in Par. Mem. Hi&s;t. Tindal.</NOTE> The magi&s;trates were apprehended, and
conveyed pri&s;oners to Edinburgh, where the lords ju&s;ti|ciary,
having taken cognizance of the affair, declared
them innocent; &s;o that they were immediately di&s;charged.
Bu&s;hel was tried for murther, convicted, and condemned;
but, in&s;tead of undergoing the penalties of the law, he
was indulged with a pardon, and promoted in the &s;ervice.
Daniel Campbell having petitioned the Hou&s;e of Com|mons,
that he might be indemnified for the damage he
had &s;u&s;tained from the rioters, a bill pa&s;&s;ed in his favour,
granting him a certain &s;um, to be rai&s;ed from an impo|&s;ition
laid upon all the beer and ale brewed in the city of
Gla&s;gow. The malt-tax was &s;o &s;en&s;ibly felt in Scotland,
that the convention of the royal burghs pre&s;ented a re|mon&s;trance
again&s;t it, as a grievous burthen, which their
country could not bear: petitions to the &s;ame purport
were delivered to the Commons from different &s;hires of
that kingdom.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The Duke of Wharton, having con&s;umed his fortune in riot and ex|travagance, repaired to the court of Vienna, from whence he proceeded to Rome, and offered his &s;ervice to the Pretender.

He was &s;ent by the Chevalier de St. George with credentials to the court of Madrid, where he abjured the prote&s;tant religion, married a lady of the Queen of Spain's bed-chamber, and obtained the rank and appointments of a lieutenant colonel $word$ the Spani&s;h &s;ervice.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1726.</NOTE> On the twenty-fourth day of March,

other mea&s;ures as &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary in the pre&s;ent con|juncture.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. III. 1726.</NOTE>
A debate en&s;ued; but the majority comlied
with the demand. Some members in the Upper Hou&s;e
complained that the me&s;&s;age was not &s;ent to both Hou&s;es
of parliament; and this &s;ugge&s;tion gave ri&s;e to another
debate, in which Lord Bathur&s;t and others made &s;ome
melancholy reflexions upon the &s;tate of in&s;ignificance to
which the peers of England were reduced. Such remarks,
however, were very little minded by the mini&s;try, who had
obtained a complete victory over all oppo&s;ition. The
&s;upplies ordinary and extraordinary being granted, with
every thing el&s;e which the court thought proper to a&s;k, and
&s;everal bills pa&s;&s;ed for the regulation of civil oeconomy, the
King di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the parliament on the twenty-fourth day of
May.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVIII. By this time Peter the Czar of Mu&s;covy
was dead, and his empre&s;s Catharine had &s;ucceeded him
on the Ru&s;&s;ian throne. This prince&s;s had begun to a&s;&s;em|ble
forces in the neighbourhood of Peter&s;burgh; and to
prepare a formidable armament for a naval expedition.
King George, concluding that her de&s;ign was again&s;t
Sweden, &s;ent a &s;trong &s;quadron into the Baltick, under
the command of Sir Charles Wager, in order to antici|pate
her views upon his allies. The Engli&s;h fleet being
joined at Copenhagen by a Dani&s;h &s;quadron, alarmed the
court of Ru&s;&s;ia, which immediately i&s;&s;ued orders for re|enforcing
the garri&s;ons of Wibourg, Cron&s;lot, Revel, and
Riga. The Engli&s;h admiral, having had an audience of
his Swedi&s;h Maje&s;ty, &s;teered towards Revel, and &s;ent
thither a lieutenant, with a letter from the King of Great-Britain
to the Czarina. This was an expo&s;tulation, in
which his Maje&s;ty ob&s;erved, that he and his allies could
not fail of being alarmed at her great preparations by
&s;ea and land. He complained that mea&s;ures had been
taken at her court in favour of the Pretender: that his
repeated in&s;tances for e&s;tabli&s;hing a la&s;ting friend&s;hip with
the crown of Ru&s;&s;ia had been treated with neglect; and he
gave her to under&s;tand, that he had ordered his admiral to
<PB N="412" REF="418">
prevent her &s;hips from coming out of her harbours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1726.</NOTE> &s;hould
&s;he per&s;i&s;t in her re&s;olution to execute the de&s;igns &s;he had
projected. The Czarina, in her an&s;wer to the King, ex|pre&s;&s;ed
her &s;urpri&s;e, that &s;he had not received his Maje&s;ty's
letter until his fleet was at anchor before Revel, &s;ince it
would have been more agreeable to the cu&s;tom e&s;tabli&s;hed
among &s;overeigns, and to the amity which had &s;o long
&s;ub&s;i&s;ted between her kingdoms and the crown of Great-Britain,
to expo&s;tulate with her on her armament, and ex|pect
her an&s;wer, before he had proceeded to &s;uch an of|fen&s;ive
mea&s;ure. She a&s;&s;ured him that nothing was far|ther
from her thoughts than any de&s;igns to di&s;turb the
peace of the North; and with regard to the Pretender, it
was a frivolous and &s;tale accu&s;ation, which had been fre|quently
u&s;ed as a pretext to cover all the unkind &s;teps
lately taken again&s;t the Ru&s;&s;ian empire. Sir Charles Wa|ger
continued in his &s;tation until he received certain intel|ligence
that the Ru&s;&s;ian gallies were laid up in their win|ter
harbour: then he &s;et for the coa&s;t of Denmark,
from whence he returned to England in the month of
November.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIX. King George, that he might not &s;eem to con|vert
all his attention to the affairs of the North, had equip|ped
two other &s;quadrons; one of which was de&s;tined for
the We&s;t-Indies, under the command of Admiral Ho&s;ier:
the other, conducted by Sir John Jennings, having on
board a body of land-forces, &s;ailed from St. Helen's on
the twentieth day of July, entered the bay of St. Antonio,
then vi&s;ited Li&s;bon, from whence he directed his cour&s;e to
the bay of Bulls, near Cadiz, and crui&s;ed off Cape St.
Mary's, &s;o as to alarm the coa&s;t of Spain, and fill Madrid
with con&s;ternation. Yet he committed no act of ho&s;tility;
but was treated with great civility by the Spani&s;h governor
of Cadiz, who &s;upplied him with refre&s;hments. Re$$-Admiral
Ho&s;ier, with &s;even &s;hips of war, had &s;ailed in
April for the Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indies, with in&s;tructions to
block up the galleous in the ports of that country; or,
&s;hould they pre&s;ume to come out, to &s;ei&s;e and bring them to
<PB N="413" REF="419">
England. Before his arrival at the Ba&s;timentos, near
Porto-Bello, the trea&s;ure, con&s;i&s;ting of above &s;ix millions
&s;terling, had been unloaded, and carried back to Panama,
in pur&s;uance of an order &s;ent by an advice-boat, which
had the &s;tart of Ho&s;ier. This admiral lay inactive on that
&s;tation, until he became the je&s;t of the Spaniards. He
returned to Jamaica, where he found means to re-enforce
his crews: then he &s;tood over to Carthagena. The
Spaniards had by this time &s;ei&s;ed the Engli&s;h South-Sea
&s;hip at la Vera-Cruz, together with all the ve&s;&s;els and
effects belonging to that company. Ho&s;ier in vain de|manded
re&s;titution: he took &s;ome Spani&s;h &s;hips by way
of repri&s;al, and continued crui&s;ing in tho&s;e &s;eas until the
greater part of his men peri&s;hed deplorably by the di&s;ea&s;es
of that unhealthy climate; and his &s;hips were totally
ruined by the worms. This brave officer being re&s;tricted
by his orders from obeying the dictates of his courage,
&s;eeing his be&s;t officers and men daily &s;wept off by an
outrageous di&s;temper, and his &s;hips expo&s;ed to inevitable
de&s;truction, is &s;aid to have died of a broken heart; while
the people of England loudly clamoured again&s;t this un|fortunate
expedition, in which &s;o many lives were thrown
away, and &s;o much money expended, without the lea&s;t
advantage to the nation. It &s;eems to have been a mean,
piratical &s;cheme to rob the court of Spain of its expected
trea&s;ure, even while a peace &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the two
nations. The mini&s;try of Great-Britain indeed alledged,
that the Spani&s;h King had entered into engagements in
favour of the Pretender.</P>
<P>&sect; XXX. The Dukes of Ormond and Wharton, and
the Earl Mari&s;chal, were certainly at Madrid; and the
Duke de Ripperda, now prime-mini&s;ter of Spain, dropped
&s;ome expre&s;&s;ions to the Engli&s;h envoy, that implied &s;ome
&s;uch de&s;ign, which, however, the court of Madrid po&s;i|tively
denied. Ripperda, as a foreigner, fell a &s;acrifice
to the jealou&s;y of the Spani&s;h mini&s;ters. He was &s;ud|denly
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his employments, with a pen&s;ion of
three thou&s;and pi&s;toles. He forthwith took refuge in the
<PB N="414" REF="420">
hou&s;e of Vandermeer the Dutch amba&s;&s;ador, who was
unwilling to be troubled with &s;uch a gue&s;t. He, there|fore,
conveyed the Duke in his coach to the hou&s;e
of Colonel Stanhope, the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter, who&s;e pro|tection
he craved and obtained. Neverthele&s;s, he was
dragged from thence by force, and committed pri&s;oner to
the ca&s;tle of Segovia. He afterwards made his e&s;cape, and
&s;heltered him&s;elf in England, from the re&s;entment of his
Catholick Maje&s;ty. Colonel Stanhope complained of this
violation of the law of nations, which the Spani&s;h mini|&s;ters
endeavoured to excu&s;e. Memorials and letters pa&s;&s;ed
between the two courts; and every thing tended to a
rupture. The King of Spain purcha&s;ed &s;hips of war;
began to make preparations for &s;ome important under|taking;
and a&s;&s;embled an army of twenty thou&s;and men
at St. Roch, on preten&s;e of rebuilding the old ca&s;tle of
Gibraltar. Mean while the States-General and the King
of Sweden acceded to the treaty of Hanover: but the King
of Pru&s;&s;ia, though his Maje&s;ty's &s;on-in-law, was detached
from the alliance by the Emperor, with whom he contracted
new engagements.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXI. On the &s;eventeenth day of January, the Bri|ti&s;h
parliament was opened with a long, elaborate &s;peech,
importing that the proceedings and tran&s;actions of the
Emperor and King of Spain, and the &s;ecret offen&s;ive al|liances
concluded between them, had laid the foundations
of a mo&s;t exorbitant and formidable power: that they
were directly levelled again&s;t the mo&s;t valuable and darling
intere&s;ts and privileges of the Engli&s;h nation, which mu&s;t
either give up Gibraltar to Spain, and acquie&s;ce in the
Emperor's u&s;urped exerci&s;e of commerce, or re&s;olve vi|gorou&s;ly
to defend their undoubted rights again&s;t tho&s;e
reciprocal engagements, contracted in defiance and vi|olation
of all national faith, and the mo&s;t &s;olemn treaties.
He a&s;&s;ured them, that one of tho&s;e &s;ecret articles was, the
placing the Pretender on the throne of Great-Britain; and
another the conque&s;t of Gibraltar and Port-Mahon. He
affirmed that tho&s;e combinations extended them&s;elves into
<PB N="415" REF="421">
Ru&s;&s;ia; and that the Engli&s;h fleet &s;ea&s;onably prevented
&s;uch de&s;igns as would have opened a way to the inva&s;ion of
the&s;e kingdoms. He exhorted the Commons to grant &s;uch
&s;upplies as &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary for the defence of their
country, and for making good his engagements with the
allies of Great-Britain. He told them, that the King of
Spain had ordered his mini&s;ter re&s;iding in England to quit
the kingdom; and that he had left a memorial, little &s;hort
of a declaration; in which he in&s;i&s;ted upon the re&s;titution
of Gibraltar. He did not fail to touch the energick &s;trings
which always moved their pa&s;&s;ions; the balance of power
in Europe, the &s;ecurity of the Briti&s;h commerce, the de|&s;igns
of a popi&s;h pretender, the pre&s;ent happy e&s;tabli&s;hment,
the religion, liberties, and properties of a prote&s;tant peo|ple.
Such addre&s;&s;es of thanks were penned in both
Hou&s;es as the mini&s;ters were plea&s;ed to dictate; yet not
without oppo&s;ition from a minority, which was far from
being formidable, though headed by chiefs of uncommon
talents and re&s;olution. The Commons voted twenty
thou&s;and &s;eamen, be&s;ides &s;ix-and-twenty thou&s;and three
hundred eighty-three men for the land-&s;ervice; and, to
defray the extraordinary expen&s;e, a land-tax of &s;our &s;hillings
in the pound was granted.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXII. The Hou&s;e of Lords having taken into con|&s;ideration
the letters and memorials between the mini&s;ters
of Great-Britain, France, and Spain, and the papers re|lating
to the acce&s;&s;ion of the States-General to the treaty
of Hanover, a warm debate en&s;ued. Lord Bathur&s;t
took notice, that the acce&s;&s;ion of the States-General to
the treaty was upon condition that this their act &s;hould
be approved and ratified by the King of Great-Britain,
the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, and the King of Pru&s;&s;ia; but
that the mini&s;ter of his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty had refu&s;ed to &s;ign
the act of acce&s;&s;ion, which was therefore of no effect: that
if the court of France &s;hould, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, think
it&s;elf di&s;engaged from the Hanover alliance, Britain alone
would be obliged to bear the burthen of an expen&s;ive war
again&s;t two of the greate&s;t potentates of Europe. He &s;aid
<PB N="416" REF="422">
he could not &s;ee any ju&s;t rea&s;on for a rupture with Spain:
that indeed the Duke de Ripperda might have dropped
&s;ome indi&s;creet expre&s;&s;ions: he was known to be a man of
a violent temper; and he had been &s;olemnly di&s;avowed by
his Catholick Maje&s;ty: that, in the memorial left by the
Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, he imputed the violent &s;tate of affairs
between the two crowns to the mini&s;ters of England; and
mentioned a po&s;itive promi&s;e made by the King of Great-Britain
for the re&s;titution of Gibraltar: that methods of
accommodation might be tried, before the kingdom en|gaged
in a war which mu&s;t be attended with dangerous
con&s;equences: that the nation was loaded with a debt of
fifty millions; and, in order to maintain &s;uch a war,
would be obliged to rai&s;e &s;even millions yearly; an annual
&s;um by which the people would &s;oon be exhau&s;ted. He
ob&s;erved, that in &s;ome papers laid before the Hou&s;e,
mention was made of great &s;ums di&s;tributed in divers
places, to bring certain mea&s;ures to bear. He declared,
that, for his own part, he had touched neither Spani&s;h nor
Engli&s;h gold; he was neither a Spaniard nor a Frenchman,
but a true Engli&s;hman, and &s;o long as he had the honour
to &s;it in that Hou&s;e, he would &s;peak and act for the good
of his country. He, therefore, de&s;ired their lord&s;hips &s;eri|ou&s;ly
to con&s;ider the matter before them, which was of the
la&s;t con&s;equence and importance to the whole nation.
He &s;aid nothing could be gained by the war, &s;hould it prove
&s;ucce&s;sful: and every thing would be lo&s;t &s;hould it be un|pro&s;perous.
He was an&s;wered by Lord Town&s;hend, who
affirmed that his Maje&s;ty had received po&s;itive and certain
information with re&s;pect to the &s;ecret article of alliance
between the courts of Vienna and Madrid, in favour of
the Pretender, though the &s;afety of the &s;tate did not permit
him to lay the&s;e advices before the parliament. After
much altercation, the majority re&s;olved, that the mea&s;ures
his Maje&s;ty had thought &s;it to take were honourable,
ju&s;t, and nece&s;&s;ary, for preventing the execution of the
dangerous engagements entered into in favour of the Pre|tender;
for pre&s;erving the dominions belonging to the
<PB N="417" REF="423">
crown of Great-Britain by &s;olemn treaties, and particu|larly
tho&s;e of Gibraltar and the i&s;land of Minorca; and
for maintaining to his people their mo&s;t valuable rights and
privileges of commerce, and the peace and tranquillity of
Europe. Seventeen lords entered a prote&s;t again&s;t this
re&s;olution. Di&s;putes of the &s;ame nature aro&s;e from the
&s;ame &s;ubject in the Lower Hou&s;e. Lord Town&s;hend
had affirmed in the Hou&s;e of Peers, that no promi&s;e of re|&s;toring
Gibraltar had been made: Sir Robert Walpole
owned &s;uch a promi&s;e in the Hou&s;e of Commons: a motion
was made for an addre&s;s, de&s;iring the&s;e engagements
might be laid before the Hou&s;e: another member moved
for a copy of the memorial pre&s;ented by Mr. Pointz to the
King of Sweden, and for the &s;ecret offen&s;ive article be|tween
the courts of Vienna and Madrid: a third motion
was made, to addre&s;s the King for &s;uch memorials and re|pre&s;entations
from the courts of Sweden and Denmark, as
induced him, in the cour&s;e of the preceding year, to &s;end
a &s;quadron to the Baltick. In the account of the money
granted for the &s;ervice of the la&s;t year, there was an article
of one hundred and twenty-five thou&s;and pounds charged
in general terms, as i&s;&s;ued out for other engagements and
expen&s;es, over and above &s;uch as were &s;pecified. Mr.
Pulteney moved for an addre&s;s on this &s;ubject; but each of
the&s;e motions was rejected on a divi&s;ion; and the majo|rity
concurred in an addre&s;s of thanks to his Maje&s;ty, for
the great wi&s;dom of his conduct. They expre&s;&s;ed the
mo&s;t implicit confidence in his goodne&s;s and di&s;cretion:
they promi&s;ed to &s;upport him in all &s;uch further mea&s;ures
as he &s;hould find nece&s;&s;ary and expedient for preventing a
rupture, as well as for con&s;ulting the honour and advan|tage
of the&s;e kingdoms.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIII. His Maje&s;ty's &s;peech gave &s;uch umbrage to
the Court of Vienna, that Mr. Palms, the Imperial re&s;i|dent
at London, was ordered to pre&s;ent a warm memorial
to the King, and afterwards to publi&s;h it to the whole
nation. In this bold remon&s;trance, the King was charged
with having declared from the throne, as certain and un|doubted
<PB N="418" REF="424">
facts, &s;everal things that were either wre&s;ted, mi&s;|repre&s;ented,
or void of all foundation. The memoriali&s;t
affirmed, that the treaty of Vienna was built on the qua|druple
alliance: that the treaty of commerce was calcu|lated
to promote the mutual and lawful advantages of the
&s;ubjects of both parties, agreeably to the law of nations;
and in no re&s;pect prejudicial to the Briti&s;h nation. He de|clared,
that there was no offen&s;ive alliance concluded be|tween
the two crowns: that the &s;uppo&s;ed article relating
to the Pretender was an ab&s;olute fal&s;ehood: that the in|&s;inuation
with re&s;pect to the &s;iege of Gibraltar was equally
untrue, his ma&s;ter having made no engagements with the
King of Spain but &s;uch as were &s;pecified in the treaty com|municated
to his Britannick Maje&s;ty. He &s;aid, however,
the ho&s;tilities notoriou&s;ly committed in the We&s;t-Indies,
and el&s;ewhere, again&s;t the King of Spain, in violation of
treaties, &s;eemed to ju&s;tify that prince's undertaking the
&s;iege of Gibraltar. Finally, he demanded, in the name of
his Imperial Maje&s;ty, &s;uitable reparation for the injury his
honour had &s;u&s;tained from &s;uch calumnious imputations.
Both Hou&s;es of parliament expre&s;&s;ed their indignation at
the in&s;olence of this memorial, in an addre&s;s to his Ma|je&s;ty;
and Mr. Palms was ordered to depart the kingdom.
Virulent declarations were pre&s;ented by the mini&s;ter of
the Emperor and the King of Great-Britain to the diet of
the empire at Rati&s;bon; and &s;uch per&s;onal reflexions re|torted
between the&s;e two potentates, that all hope of recon|ciliation
vani&s;hed.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIV. King George, in order to &s;ecure him&s;elf
again&s;t the impending &s;torm, entered into more &s;trict en|gagements
with the French King; and agreed to pay fifty
thou&s;and pounds for three years to the King of Sweden,
in con&s;ideration of that prince's holding in readine&s;s a body
of ten thou&s;and troops for the occa&s;ions of the alliance.
He concluded a fre&s;h treaty with the King of Denmark,
who promi&s;ed to furni&s;h a certain number of auxiliaries,
on account of a large &s;ub&s;idy granted by the King of
France. The proportions of troops to be &s;ent into the
<PB N="419" REF="425">
field, in ca&s;e of a rupture, were a&s;certained. His Britan|nick
Maje&s;ty engaged for four-and-twenty thou&s;and men,
and a &s;trong &s;quadron to be &s;ent into the Baltick. He
made a convention with the Prince of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el, who
undertook to provide eight thou&s;and infantry, and four
thou&s;and hor&s;e, in con&s;ideration of &s;eventy-four thou&s;and
pounds, to be paid by Great-Britain immediately, and fifty
thou&s;and pounds more in ca&s;e the troops &s;hould be re|quired,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Annals. Deb. in Par. Tindal. Lives of the Admirals.</NOTE>
be&s;ides their pay and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Such was the
fruit of all the alliances &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly planned &s;ince the
acce&s;&s;ion of King George to the throne of Great-Britain.
In the day of his trouble, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, who had
e&s;pou&s;ed his daughter, de&s;erted his intere&s;t; and the States-General
&s;tood aloof. For the &s;ecurity of his German do|minions,
he had recour&s;e to the King of France, who
was a precarious ally; to the Kings of Sweden and Den|mark,
and the principality of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el: but none of
the&s;e powers would contribute their a&s;&s;i&s;tance without
being gratified with exorbitant &s;ub&s;idies, though the
danger was common, and the efforts ought to have been
equal. In&s;tead of allies, they profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves merce|naries.
Great-Britain paid them for the defence of their
own dominions; &s;he, moreover, undertook to maintain a
powerful fleet for their &s;afety. Is there any Briton &s;o weak
as to think, or &s;o fool-hardy as to affirm, that this was a
Briti&s;h quarrel.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXV. For the &s;upport of tho&s;e expen&s;ive treaties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1727.</NOTE>
Mr. Scroope, &s;ecretary of the Trea&s;ury, moved in the
Hou&s;e of Commons, that in the malt-tax bill they &s;hould
in&s;ert a clau&s;e of appropriation, empowering the King to
apply &s;uch &s;ums as &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary for defraying the
expen&s;es and engagements which had been or &s;hould be
made before the twenty-fifth day of September, in con|certing
&s;uch mea&s;ures as he &s;hould think mo&s;t conducive
to the &s;ecurity of trade, and re&s;toring the peace of Europe.
To little purpo&s;e did the members in the oppo&s;ition urge,
that this method of a&s;king and granting &s;upplies was un|parliamentary:
that &s;uch a clau&s;e would render ineffectual
<PB N="420" REF="426">
that appropriation of the publick money,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Book II. 1727.</NOTE> which the wi&s;dom
of all parliaments had thought a nece&s;&s;ary &s;ecurity again&s;t
mi&s;application, which was the more to be feared, as no
provi&s;ion was made to call any per&s;on to account for the
money that &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed of by virtue of this clau&s;e:
that great &s;ums had already been granted: that &s;uch an
unlimited power ought never to be given in a free govern|ment:
that &s;uch confidence in the crown might, through
the influence of evil mini&s;ters, be attended with the mo&s;t
dangerous con&s;equences: that the con&s;titution could not
be pre&s;erved, but by a &s;trict adherence to tho&s;e e&s;&s;ential
parliamentary forms of granting &s;upplies upon e&s;timates,
and of appropriating the&s;e &s;upplies to &s;ervices and occa&s;ions
publickly avowed and judged nece&s;&s;ary: that &s;uch clau&s;es,
if not &s;ea&s;onably checked, would become &s;o frequent, as
in time to lodge in the crown, and in the mini&s;ters, an
ab&s;olute and uncontrollable power of rai&s;ing money upon
the people, which by the con&s;titution is, and with &s;afety
can only be, lodged in the whole legi&s;lature. The motion
was carried, the clau&s;e added, and the bill pa&s;&s;ed through
the other Hou&s;e without amendment, though not without
oppo&s;ition. Notwith&s;tanding this vote of credit, Sir
William Yonge moved, that towards the &s;upply granted
to the King, the &s;um of three hundred and &s;eventy thou|&s;and
pounds &s;hould be rai&s;ed by loans on Exchequer-Bills,
to be charged on the &s;urplus of the duties on coal and
culm, which was re&s;erved for the parliament's di&s;po&s;al.
Though this motion was vigorou&s;ly oppo&s;ed by Sir Jo&s;eph
Jekyl and Mr. Pulteney, as a dangerous deviation from
&s;everal votes and acts of parliament, by which the exceed|ings
of the publick funds were appropriated to the di&s;charge
of the national debt, or to the increa&s;e of the &s;inking-fund,
it was carried by the majority.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVI. On the fifteenth day of May the parliament
was prorogued, after the King had acknowledged their
zeal, liberality, and di&s;patch; and given them to under|&s;tand,
that the &s;iege of Gibraltar was actually begun.
The trenches were opened before this &s;ortre&s;s on the
<PB N="421" REF="427">
eleventh day of February,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. III. 1727.</NOTE> by the Cond&eacute; de las Torres, at
the head of twenty thou&s;and men. The place was well
provided for a defence; and the old Earl of Portmore, who
was governor, embarked with a re-enforcement from
England, under convoy of a fleet commanded by Sir
Charles Wager. He arrived at Gibraltar in the begin|ning
of April, where he landed the troops, with a great
quantity of ammunition, warlike &s;tores, and four-and-twenty
pieces of cannon. At the &s;ame time, five hundred
men arrived from Minorca; &s;o that the garri&s;on amounted
to &s;ix thou&s;and, plentifully &s;upplied with fre&s;h provi&s;ions
from the coa&s;t of Barbary, and treated the efforts of the
be&s;iegers with great contempt. The States-General, be|ing
apprehen&s;ive of an attempt upon their barrier in the
Netherlands, de&s;ired the King would hold in readine&s;s
the ten thou&s;and auxiliaries &s;tipulated in the treaty. The&s;e
were immediately prepared for embarkation, and the forces
of England were augmented with thirty new-rai&s;ed com|panies.
Sir John Norris &s;et &s;ail with a powerful fleet for
the Baltick, and was joined by a Dani&s;h &s;quadron; but
the Czarina dying on the &s;eventeenth day of May, he had
no occa&s;ion to commit ho&s;tilities, as the Ru&s;&s;ian armament
was laid a&s;ide.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVII. Mean while the powers at variance, though
extremely irritated again&s;t each other, were all equally
aver&s;e to a war that might again embroil all Europe.
The King of France interpo&s;ed his mediation, which
was conducted by the Duke de Richlieu, his amba&s;&s;ador
at Vienna. Plans and counterplans of pacification were
propo&s;ed between the two crowns and the allies. At
length all parties agreed to twelve preliminary articles,
which were &s;igned in May at Paris, by the mini&s;ters of
the Hanover alliance, and afterwards at Vienna, by the
Imperial and Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;adors. The&s;e imported that
ho&s;tilities &s;hould immediately cea&s;e: that the charter of
the O&s;tend company &s;hould be &s;u&s;pended for &s;even years;
and that a congre&s;s &s;hould in four months be opened at
Aix-la-Chapelle, for adju&s;ting all differences, and con|&s;olidating
<PB N="422" REF="428">
&s;olidating the peace of Europe. This congre&s;s was after|wards
transferred to Soi&s;&s;ons, for the conveniency of the
French mini&s;ter, who&s;e pre&s;ence was nece&s;&s;ary at court.
The &s;iege of Gibraltar was rai&s;ed, after it had la&s;ted four
months, during which the Spaniards lo&s;t a great number
of men by &s;ickne&s;s, while the garri&s;on &s;u&s;tained very
little damage. The court of Madrid, however, &s;tarted
&s;ome new difficulties and for &s;ome time would not con|&s;ent
to the re&s;titution of the South-Sea &s;hip, which had
been detained at La Vera Cruz, in the We&s;t-Indies; &s;o
that Sir Charles Wager continued to crui&s;e on the coa&s;t
of Spain; but the&s;e objections were removed in the &s;equel.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVIII. King George, having appointed a re|gency,
embarked at Greenwich, on the third day of June,
and landing in Holland on the &s;eventh, &s;et out on his
journey to Hanover. He was &s;uddenly &s;ei&s;ed with a pa|ralytick
di&s;order on the road; he forthwith lo&s;t the fa|culty
of &s;peech, became lethargick, and was conveyed in a
&s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility to O&s;nabruck. There he expired on
Sunday the eleventh day of June, in the &s;ixty-eighth year
of his age; and in the thirteenth of his reign. George I.
was plain and &s;imple in his per&s;on and addre&s;s; grave and
compo&s;ed in his deportment, though ea&s;y, familiar, and
facetious in his hours of relaxation. Before he a&s;cended
the throne of Great-Britain, he had acquired the cha|racter
of a circum&s;pect general, a ju&s;t and merciful prince,
a wi&s;e politician, who perfectly under&s;tood, and &s;teadily
pur&s;ued his own intere&s;t. With the&s;e qualities, it cannot
be doubted but that he came to England extremely well
di&s;po&s;ed to govern his new &s;ubjects according to the max|ims
of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, and the genius of the peo|ple;
and if ever he &s;eemed to deviate from the&s;e princi|ples,
we may take it for granted, that he was mi&s;led by the
venal &s;ugge&s;tions of a mini&s;try, who&s;e power and influence
were founded on corruption<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>George I. married the Prince&s;s Sophia Dorothy, daughter and heire&s;s of the Duke of Zell, by whom he had King George II. and the late Queen of Pru&s;&s;ia. The King's body was conveyed to Hanover, and interred among his auce&s;tors.</P>

<P>&sect; I. AT the acce&s;&s;ion of George II. the nation had
great rea&s;on to wi&s;h for an alteration of mea|&s;ures.
The publick debt, notwith&s;tanding the boa&s;ted
oeconomy and management of the mini&s;ters; notwith|&s;tanding
the &s;inking fund, which had been extolled as a
growing trea&s;ure &s;acred to the di&s;charge of national in|cumbrances;
was now increa&s;ed to fifty millions two
hundred &s;ixty-one thou&s;and two hundred and &s;ix pounds,
nineteen &s;hillings, eight pence three farthings. The king|dom
was bewildered in a labyrinth of treaties and con|ventions,
by which it &s;tood engaged in pecuniary &s;ub|&s;idies
to many powers upon the continent, with whom its
real intere&s;ts could never be connected. The wealth of
the nation had been lavi&s;hed upon the&s;e foreign con|nexions;
upon unnece&s;&s;ary wars, and fruitle&s;s expeditions.
Dangerous encroachments had been made upon the con|&s;titution,
by the repeal of the act for triennial parlia|ments;
by frequent &s;u&s;pen&s;ions of the Habeas Corpus act
upon frivolous occa&s;ions; by repealing clau&s;es in the act
of &s;ettlement; by votes of credit; by habituating the
people to a &s;tanding army; and, above all, by e&s;tabli&s;hing
a &s;y&s;tem of corruption, which at all times would &s;ecure a
majority in parliament. The nature of prerogative, by
which the liberties of the nation had formerly been often
endangered, was now &s;o well under&s;tood, and &s;o &s;ecurely
re&s;trained, that it could no longer be u&s;ed for the &s;ame
oppre&s;&s;ive purpo&s;es; be&s;ides, an avowed exten&s;ion of the
prerogative required more ability, courage, and re&s;olution,
than the pre&s;ent mini&s;try could exert. They under&s;tood
$heir own &s;trength, and had recour&s;e to a more &s;afe and
effectual expedient. The vice, luxury, and pro&s;titution
of the age, the almo&s;t total extinction of &s;entiment, ho|nour,
and public &s;pirit, had prepared the minds of men
or &s;lavery and corruption. The means were in the hands
<PB N="426" REF="432">
of the mini&s;try; the publick trea&s;ure was at their devo|tion;
they multiplied places and pen&s;ions, to increa&s;e the
number of their dependents: they &s;quandered away the
money of the nation without ta&s;te, di&s;cernment, decency,
or remor&s;e; they inli&s;ted an army of the mo&s;t abandoned
emi&s;&s;aries, whom they employed to vindicate the wor&s;t
mea&s;ures, in the face of truth, common &s;en&s;e, and common
hone&s;ty; and they did not fail to &s;tigmatize as Jacobites,
and enemies to the government, all tho&s;e who pre&s;umed to
que&s;tion the merit of their admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>&sect; II. The &s;upreme direction of affairs was not yet engro&s;|&s;ed
by a &s;ingle mini&s;ter. Lord Town&s;hend had the reputa|tion
of conducting the external tran&s;actions relating to trea|ties
and negociations. He is &s;aid to have under&s;tood that
province, though he did not always follow the dictates of
his own under&s;tanding. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an exten&s;ive fund of
knowledge; and was well acquainted with the functions of
his office. The Duke of N. his colleague, was not remark|able
for any of the&s;e qualifications; he owned his promotion
to his uncommon zeal for the illu&s;trious hou&s;e of Hanover,
and the &s;trength of his intere&s;t in parliament, rather than to
his judgment, preci&s;ion, or any other intellectual merit.
Lord C. who may be counted an auxiliary, though not im|mediately
concerned in the admini&s;tration, had di&s;tingui&s;hed
him&s;elf in the character of envoy at &s;everal courts in Europe.
He had attained an intimate knowledge of all the different
intere&s;ts and connexions &s;ub&s;i&s;ting among the powers of
the continent; and he infinitely &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all the mini&s;ters
in learning and capacity. He was, indeed, the only man
of genius employed under this government. He &s;poke
with ca&s;e and propriety; his conceptions were ju&s;t and
lively; his inferences bold; his coun&s;els vigorous and
warm. Yet he depreciated his talents, by acting in a &s;ub|ordinate
character to tho&s;e whom he de&s;pi&s;ed; and &s;eemed
to look upon the pernicious mea&s;ures of a bad mini&s;try
with &s;ilent contempt, rather than with avowed dete&s;tation.
The interior government of Great-Britain was chiefly
<PB N="427" REF="433">
managed by Sir Robert W. a man of extraordinary talents,
who had from low beginnings rai&s;ed him&s;elf to the head
of the Trea&s;ury. Having obtained a &s;eat in the Lower
Hou&s;e, he declared him&s;elf one of the mo&s;t forward par|ti&s;ans
of the Whig faction. He was endued with a &s;pecies
of eloquence, which, though neither nervous nor elegant,
flowed with great facility, and was &s;o plau&s;ible on all &s;ub|jects,
that even when he mi&s;repre&s;ented the truth, whether
from ignorance or de&s;ign, he &s;eldom failed to per&s;uade that
part of his audience for who&s;e hearing his harangue was
chiefly intended. He was well acquainted with the nature
of the public funds, and under&s;tood the whole my&s;tery of
&s;tock-jobbing. This knowledge procured a connexion be|tween
him and the money-corporations, which &s;erved to
enhance his importance. He perceived the bulk of man|kind
were actuated by a &s;ordid thir&s;t of lucre; he had &s;a|gacity
enough to convert the degeneracy of the times to
his own advantage; and on this, and this alone, he found|ed
the whole &s;uper&s;tructure of his &s;ub&s;equent admini&s;tra|tion.
In the late reign he had, by dint of &s;peaking deci|&s;ively
to every que&s;tion, by boldly impeaching the conduct
of the Tory mini&s;ters, by his activity in elections, and en|gaging
as a projector in the &s;chemes of the monied-intere&s;t,
become a leading member in the Hou&s;e of Commons. By
his &s;ufferings under the Tory parliament, he attained the
rank of a martyr to his party; his intere&s;t, his reputation,
and his pre&s;umption daily increa&s;ed; he oppo&s;ed Sunder|land
as his rival in power, and headed a dangerous defec|tion
from the mini&s;try, which evinced the greatne&s;s of his
influence and authority. He had the glory of being prin|cipally
concerned in effecting a reconciliation between
the late King and the Prince of Wales; then he was re|a&s;&s;ociated
in the admini&s;tration with additional credit;
and, from the death of the Earls of Sunderland and Stan|$ope,
he had been making long &s;trides towards the office
of prime-mini&s;ter. He knew the maxims he had adopted
would &s;ubject him to the hatred, the ridicule, and reproach
<PB N="428" REF="434">
of &s;ome individuals, who had not yet re&s;igned all &s;enti|ments
of patrioti&s;m, nor all views of oppo&s;ition; but the
number of the&s;e was incon&s;iderable, when compared to
that which con&s;tituted the body of the community; and
he would not &s;uffer the con&s;ideration of &s;uch antagoni&s;ts
to come in competition with his &s;chemes of power, afflu|ence,
and authority. Neverthele&s;s, low as he had hum|bled
antimini&s;terial a&s;&s;ociation, it required all his artifice
to elude, all his patience and natural phlegm to bear the
powerful arguments that were urged, and the keen &s;atire
that was exerci&s;ed again&s;t his mea&s;ures and management,
by a few members in the oppo&s;ition. Sir William Wynd|ham
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the energy of elocution; Mr. Shippen
was calm, intrepid, &s;hrewd, and &s;arca&s;tic; Mr. Hunger|ford,
&s;ly, in&s;inuating, and ironical. Mr. W. P. inherited
from nature a good under&s;tanding, which he had &s;tudiou&s;ly
cultivated. He was one of the mo&s;t learned members in
the Hou&s;e of Commons, extremely well qualified to judge
of literary productions; well read in hi&s;tory and poli|ticks;
deeply &s;killed in the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, the detail
of government, and the nature of the finances. He &s;poke
with freedom, fluency, and uncommon warmth of decla|mation,
which was &s;aid to be the effect of per&s;onal ani|mo&s;ity
to Sir R. W. with whom he had been formerly
connected.</P>
<P>&sect; III. An expre&s;s arriving on the fourteenth day of
June, with an account of the King's death, his late
Maje&s;ty King George II. repaired from Richmond, where
he received this intelligence, to Leice&s;ter-Hou&s;e; and the
members of the privy-council being a&s;&s;embled, were &s;worn
a-new. The King declared his firm purpo&s;e to pre&s;erve
the con&s;titution in church and &s;tate, and to cultivate
tho&s;e alliances which his father had made with foreign
princes. At the &s;ame time, he took and &s;ub&s;cribed the
oath for the &s;ecurity of the church of Scotland, as required
by the act of Union. Next day he was proclaimed King
of Great-Britain. The parliament a&s;&s;embled in pur&s;uance
of the act made for that purpo&s;e; but was immediately
<PB N="429" REF="435">
prorogued by commi&s;&s;ion to the twenty-&s;eventh day of the
month. All the great officers of &s;tate continued in their
places: Sir Robert Walpole kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Trea|&s;ury;
and the &s;y&s;tem of politicks which the late king
had e&s;tabli&s;hed underwent no &s;ort of alteration. The
King, in his &s;peech to both Hou&s;es at the opening of the
&s;e&s;&s;ion, profe&s;&s;ed a fixed re&s;olution to merit the love and
affection of his people, by maintaining them in the full
enjoyment of their religious and civil rights. He pro|mi&s;ed
to le&s;&s;en the publick expen&s;e as &s;oon as the circum|&s;tances
of affairs would permit: he ob&s;erved to the Com|mons,
that the grant of the greate&s;t part of the civil-li&s;t
revenues was now determined; and that it would be ne|ce&s;&s;ary
for them to make a new provi&s;ion for the &s;upport
of him and his family: la&s;tly, he recommended it to both
Hou&s;es to di&s;patch the bu&s;ine&s;s that &s;hould be nece&s;&s;arily
brought before them, as the &s;ea&s;on of the year and the
circum&s;tances of time required their pre&s;ence in the coun|try.
Addre&s;&s;es of condolance and congratulation being
drawn up and pre&s;ented, the Commons, in a committee of
the whole Hou&s;e, took into con&s;ideration a motion for a
&s;upply to his Maje&s;ty. Sir Robert Walpole having ob|&s;erved
that the annual &s;um of &s;even hundred thou&s;and
pounds granted to, and &s;ettled on the late King, had
fallen &s;hort every year; and that his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty's
expen&s;es were likely to increa&s;e, by rea&s;on of the largene&s;s
of his family, moved that the entire revenues of the civil|li&s;t,
which produced about eight hundred thou&s;and pounds
per annum, &s;hould be &s;ettled on the King during his life.
Mr. Shippen oppo&s;ed this motion, as incon&s;i&s;tent with the
tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them as repre&s;entatives of the people, who
ought to be very frugal in exerci&s;ing the right of giving
away the publick money. He &s;aid the &s;um of &s;even
hundred thou&s;and pounds was not obtained for his late
Maje&s;ty without a long and &s;olemn debate; and every
member who contended for it at that time allowed it to
be an ample royal revenue: that, although his Maje&s;ty's
family &s;hould be enlarged, a circum&s;tance which had been
<PB N="430" REF="436">
urged as one rea&s;on for the motion, he pre&s;umed the ap|pointments
of Prince Frederick would be much inferior
to tho&s;e &s;ettled on his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty when he was Prince
of Wales: be&s;ides, it was to be hoped that many per&s;onal,
many particular expen&s;es in the late reign, e&s;pecially tho&s;e
for frequent journies to Hanover, would be di&s;continued,
and entirely cea&s;e. He ob&s;erved that the civil-li&s;t branches
in the Queen's reign did not often exceed the &s;um of five
hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds; neverthele&s;s, &s;he
called upon her parliament but once, in a reign of thirteen
years, to pay the debts contracted in her civil govern|ment;
and the&s;e were occa&s;ioned by the unparalleled in|&s;tances
of her piety and genero&s;ity. She gave the fir&s;t|fruits
and tenths, ari&s;ing to nineteen thou&s;and pounds
a-year, as an augmentation of the maintenance of the poor
clergy. She be&s;towed five thou&s;and pounds per annum,
out of the Po&s;t-office, on the Duke of Marlborough: &s;he
&s;uffered &s;even hundred pounds to be charged weekly on
the &s;ame office, for the &s;ervice of the publick: &s;he ex|pended
&s;everal hundred thou&s;and pounds in building the
ca&s;tle of Blenheim: &s;he allowed four thou&s;and pounds
annually to Prince Charles of Denmark: &s;he &s;u&s;tained
great lo&s;&s;es by the tin contract: &s;he &s;upported the poor
Palatines: &s;he exhibited many other proofs of royal boun|ty;
and immediately before her death &s;he had formed a
plan of retrenchment, which would have reduced her
yearly expen&s;es to four hundred and fifty-nine thou&s;and
nine hundred and forty-one pounds. He affirmed that a
million a-year would not be &s;ufficient to carry on the
exorbitant expen&s;es, &s;o often and &s;o ju&s;tly complained of
in the Hou&s;e of Commons: that over and above the
yearly allowance of &s;even hundred thou&s;and pounds, many
occa&s;ional taxes, many exce&s;&s;ive &s;ums were rai&s;ed, and all
&s;unk in the bottomle&s;s gulf of &s;ecret &s;ervice. Two
hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds were rai&s;ed in defiance
of the ancient parliamentary methods, to &s;ecure the king|dom
from a Swedi&s;h inva&s;ion: then the two in&s;urance
offices were erected, and paid near three hundred thou&s;and
<PB N="431" REF="437">
pounds for their charters: our enmity with Sweden being
changed into alliance, a &s;ub&s;idy of &s;eventy-two thou&s;and
pounds was implicitly granted, to fulfil &s;ome &s;ecret engage|ment
with that crown: four-and-twenty thou&s;and pounds
were given for burning merchant &s;hips arrived from in|fected
places, though the goods, which ought to have been
de&s;troyed for the publick &s;afety, were afterwards privately
&s;old a &s;um of five hundred thou&s;and pounds was de|manded,
and granted, for paying the debts of the civil|li&s;t;
and his Maje&s;ty declared, by me&s;&s;age, he was re|&s;olved
to retrench his expen&s;es for the future. Notwith|&s;tanding
this re&s;olution, in le&s;s than four years, a new
demand of the like &s;um was made and granted, to di&s;charge
new incumbrances: the Spani&s;h &s;hips of war which Ad|miral
Byng took in the Mediterranean were &s;old for a
con&s;iderable &s;um of money; one hundred and twenty-five
thou&s;and pounds were granted in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, to be
&s;ecretly di&s;po&s;ed of for the publick utility; and there was
&s;till a debt in the civil government, amounting to above &s;ix
hundred thou&s;and pounds. He took notice, that this
amazing extravagance happened under the conduct of
per&s;ons pretending to &s;urpa&s;s all their predece&s;&s;ors in the
knowledge and care of the publick revenue; that as none
of the&s;e &s;ums had been accounted for, they were, in all
probability, employed in &s;ervices not fit to be owned.
He &s;aid, he heartily wi&s;hed that time, the great di&s;coverer
of hidden truths, and concealed iniquities, might produce
a li&s;t of all &s;uch as had been perverted from their publick
duty by private pen&s;ions; who had been the hired &s;laves
and the corrupt in&s;truments of a profu&s;e and vain-glorious
admini&s;tration. He propo&s;ed, that, in&s;tead of granting an
addition to the civil-li&s;t, they &s;hould re&s;trict that revenue
$ a certain &s;um, by concluding the que&s;tion with the&s;e
words, &s;tartq;in like manner as they were granted and con|$tinued
to his late Maje&s;ty, &s;o as to make up the clear
$word$ yearly &s;um of &s;even hundred thou&s;and pounds.&endq; To
$e&s;e particulars, which were indeed unan&s;werable, no
$ply was made. Even this mark of decency was laid
<PB N="432" REF="438">
a&s;ide, as idle and &s;uperfluous. The Hou&s;e agreed to the
motion; and a bill was brought in for the better &s;upport
of his Maje&s;ty's hou&s;ehold. The Commons having re|ceived
a me&s;&s;age from the King, de&s;iring they would make
further provi&s;ion for the Queen his confort, re&s;olved, That
in ca&s;e &s;he &s;hould &s;urvive his Maje&s;ty, the &s;um of one
hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;hould be &s;ettled upon her for
life, charged upon the revenues of the civil-li&s;t, together
with his Maje&s;ty's palace of Somer&s;et-Hou&s;e, and Rich|mond
Old Park. A bill was formed on this re&s;olution,
which, as well as the other, pa&s;&s;ed both Hou&s;es: and re|ceived
the royal a&s;&s;ent on the &s;eventeenth day of July,
when the King, in a &s;peech to both Hou&s;es, expre&s;&s;ed
his &s;ati&s;faction with their conduct; and congratulated
them upon the wealth and glory of the nation, by which
they had acquired &s;uch weight in holding the balance of
Europe. Then the Lord-Chancellor prorogued the parlia|ment
to the twenty-ninth day of Augu&s;t; but on the
&s;eventh of that month a proclamation was i&s;&s;ued for di&s;&s;olv|ing
this, and convoking another.</P>
<P>&sect; IV. In the interim &s;ome changes were made in differ|ent
departments of civil oeconomy. Lord Vi&s;count Tor|rington
was placed at the head of the Admiralty: the Earl
of We&s;tmorland was appointed fir&s;t lord-commi&s;&s;ioner
of trade and plantations. Philip Dormer Stanhope, Earl
of Che&s;terfield, a nobleman remarkable for his wit, elo|quence,
and poli&s;hed manners, was nominated amba&s;&s;ador
to the Hague. The privy-council being di&s;&s;olved, another
was appointed of the members then pre&s;ent. The Duke
of Devon&s;hire was dignified with the place of pre&s;ident;
and the Duke of St. Alban's was appointed ma&s;ter of the
hor&s;e. On the eleventh day of October the coronation of
the King and Queen was performed at We&s;tmini&s;ter-Abbey,
with the u&s;ual &s;olemnity<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">King George. II. a&s;cended the throne in the forty-fourth year of his age. On the &s;econd day of September, 1705, he e&s;pou&s;ed the Prince&s;s Wilhelmina Charlo$$e Caroline, daughter to John Frederick Marquis of Brandenburgh-An&s;pach, by whom he had two &s;ons, Frederick Louis Prince of Wales, born at Hanover, on the thirty-fir&s;t day of January, 1707, and William Augu&s;tus, born at London, on the fifteenth day of April, 1721. She had likewi&s;e bor'n four prince&s;&s;es, namely, Anne, Amelia, Carolina, Mary, and was afterwards delivered of Lo$i&s;a, married in the &s;equel to th$ King of Denmark.</NOTE>. By this time the
<PB N="433" REF="439">
courts of France and Spain were perfectly reconciled: all
Europe was freed from the calamities of war; and the
peace of Great-Britain &s;uffered no interruption, except from
&s;ome tran&s;ient tumults among the tinners of Cornwall,
who, being provoked by a &s;carcity of corn, ro&s;e in arms,
and plundered the granaries of that county.</P>
<P>&sect; V. The elections in England and Scotland for the par|liament
having &s;ucceeded on the new &s;y&s;tem, according
to the wi&s;hes of the mini&s;try, the two Hou&s;es met on the
twenty-third day of January, when the Commons unani|mou&s;ly
cho&s;e for their Speaker Arthur On&s;low, E&s;quire,
knight of the &s;hire for Surrey, a gentleman of exten&s;ive
knowledge, worth, and probity, grave, eloquent, vene|rable,
and every way qualified for the di&s;charge of that
honourable and important office. The King, in his &s;peech
to this new parliament, declared, that, by the la&s;t ad|vices
from abroad, he had rea&s;on to hope the difficulties
which had hitherto retarded the execution of the prelimi|naries,
and the opening of the congre&s;s, would &s;oon be
entirely removed&s; in the mean time, he repre&s;ented the
ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of continuing the preparations which
had hitherto &s;ecured the nation, and prevented an open
rupture in Europe. He promi&s;ed, that his fir&s;t care &s;hould
be to reduce from time to time the expen&s;e of the publick,
as often, and as &s;oon as the intere&s;t and &s;afety of his people
would permit &s;uch reduction. He expre&s;&s;ed an earne&s;t
de&s;ire of &s;eeing the foundation laid of an effectual &s;cheme
for the increa&s;e and encouragement of &s;eamen in general,
that they might be invited rather than compelled into the
&s;ervice of their country. Finally, he recommended una|nimity,
zeal, and di&s;patch of the publick bu&s;ine&s;s. Tho&s;e
&s;peeches, penned by the mini&s;ter, were compo&s;ed with a
view to &s;oothe the minds of the people into an immediate
<PB N="434" REF="440">
concurrence with the mea&s;ures of the government; but
without any intention of performing tho&s;e promi&s;es of
oeconomy, reformation, and national advantage. The
two Hou&s;es &s;eemed to vie with each other in expre&s;&s;ions
of applau&s;e and affection to his Maje&s;ty. The Lords, in
their addre&s;s, hailed him as the be&s;t of kings, and true
father of his country. The Commons expre&s;&s;ed the warm|e&s;t
&s;en&s;e of gratitude for the ble&s;&s;ings they enjoyed in
his reign, though it was not yet eight months old. They
approved of all his tran&s;actions; promi&s;ed to &s;upport him
in all his undertakings; and declared they would chear|fully
grant whatever &s;upplies &s;hould be wanted for the
publick &s;ervice. Having con&s;idered the e&s;timates which
were laid before them by order of his Maje&s;ty, they voted
two-and-twenty thou&s;and nine hundred and fifty-five men
for guards and garri&s;ons; and fifteen thou&s;and &s;eamen for
the &s;ervice of the en&s;uing year. They granted two hun|dred
and thirty thou&s;and nine hundred and twenty-three
pounds, for the maintenance of twelve thou&s;and He&s;&s;ian
troops; a &s;ub&s;idy of fifty thou&s;and pounds to the King of
Sweden; and half that &s;um to the Duke of Brun&s;wick
Wolfenbuttel<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Nothing could be a greater b$$$$&s;que upon negociation than this $word$ of alliance concluded with the petty Duke of We$$enbuttel, who very $word$ guarantees to his Britannick Maje&s;ty the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his three $word$ and oblige$ him&s;elf to &s;upply his Maje&s;ty with five thou&s;and men, in $$$ation of an annual &s;ub&s;idy of five-and-twenty thou&s;and pounds for $word$</NOTE>. The expen&s;e of the year amounted to four
millions, rai&s;ed by a land-tax of three &s;hillings in the
pound, a malt-tax, and by borrowing of the Bank one
million &s;even hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds; for
which annuities to the amount of &s;eventy thou&s;and pounds,
to be rai&s;ed by duties on coals imported into the city of
London, were granted to that corporation.</P>
<P>&sect; VI. All the&s;e &s;ums, however, were not granted with|out
que&s;tion. The number of land-forces occa&s;ioned
a debate; and the He&s;&s;ian auxiliaries were not allowed
without di&s;pute and oppo&s;ition. When they deliberated
on the loan of the Bank, Mr. W. Pultency ob&s;erved, that
the &s;hifting of funds was but perpetuating taxes, and putting
<PB N="435" REF="441">
off the evil day; that notwith&s;tanding the great merit
which &s;ome per&s;ons had built on the &s;inking fund, it ap|peared
that the national debt had been increa&s;ed &s;ince the
&s;etting up that pompous project. Some warm altercation
pa&s;&s;ed between him and Sir Robert Walpole on this &s;ubject.
The lord-mayor, aldermen, and common-council of Lon|don
pre&s;ented a petition, &s;etting forth, that the duties al|ready
laid upon coals and culm imported into London
affected the trade of that city only; that the inequality of the
burthen was a great di&s;couragement to their manufactures,
and an hard&s;hip upon all the trading inhabitants. The
petition was rejected, and the tax impo&s;ed. The Hou&s;e
having addre&s;&s;ed the King for a particular and di&s;tinct ac|count
of the di&s;tribution of two hundred and fifty thou|&s;and
pounds, charged to have been i&s;&s;ued for &s;ecuring the
trade and navigation of the kingdom, and pre&s;erving and re|&s;toring
the peace of Europe, he declined granting their
reque&s;t, but &s;ignified in general, that part of the money
had been i&s;&s;ued and di&s;bur&s;ed by his late Maje&s;ty, and the
remainder by him&s;elf, for carrying on the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ary
&s;ervices, which required the greate&s;t &s;ecre&s;y. Such a
me&s;&s;age in the reign of King William would have rai&s;ed
a dangerous flame in the Hou&s;e of Commons.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1728.</NOTE> Mr. W.
Pulteney inveighed again&s;t &s;uch a vague and general way
of accounting for the publick money, as tending to render
parliaments altogether in&s;ignificant, to cover embezzle|ments,
and to &s;creen corrupt and rapacious mini&s;ters.
The Commons having taken into con&s;ideration the &s;tate
of the national debt, examined the accounts, and interro|gated
the proper officers. A motion was made by a court
member, that it appeared the monies already i&s;&s;ued and
applied towards di&s;charging the national debts, together
with a &s;um to be i&s;&s;ued at Lady-day, amounted to &s;ix
millions &s;ix hundred forty-eight thou&s;and &s;even hundred
and &s;ixty-two pounds, five &s;hillings, one penny, one
farthing. In vain did the leaders of oppo&s;ition expo&s;e
the fallacious tendency of this motion. In vain did they
demon&s;trate the fraudulent artifice u&s;ed in drawing up the
<PB N="436" REF="442">
accounts:<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1728.</NOTE> the motion was carried; and &s;everal re&s;olutions
were taken on the &s;tate of the national debts. In the
particular account of the&s;e debts, upon which the Hou&s;e
re&s;olved to form a repre&s;entation to his Maje&s;ty, an article
of three hundred thou&s;and pounds relating to the duty
upon wrought plate was totally omitted. This extraordi|nary
omi&s;&s;ion being di&s;covered, gave ri&s;e to a very warm
debate, and to very &s;evere reflexions again&s;t tho&s;e who
&s;uperintended the publick accounts. This error being rec|tified,
a committee appointed for the purpo&s;e drew up
the repre&s;entation, containing a particular detail of the
national debts di&s;charged and incurred &s;ince the twenty-fifth
day of December, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even
hundred and &s;ixteen, with a &s;tate of the &s;inking fund and
of the publick credit. The draft being approved by
the Hou&s;e, was pre&s;ented to the King, who received it
graciou&s;ly. He took this opportunity of &s;aying, that the
provi&s;ion made for gradually di&s;charging the national debt
was now become &s;o certain and con&s;iderable, that nothing
but &s;ome unfore&s;een event could alter or dimini&s;h it: a
circum&s;tance that afforded the faire&s;t pro&s;pect of &s;eeing the
old debts di&s;charged, without any nece&s;&s;ity of incurring
new incumbrances.</P>
<P>&sect; VII. This an&s;wer, fraught with many other expre&s;|&s;ions
of fatherly tenderne&s;s for his people, paved the way
for a me&s;&s;age to the Hou&s;e, demanding a vote of credit to
fulfil certain engagements entered into, and concerted with
the advice and concurrence of the la&s;t parliament, for
&s;ecuring the trade and navigation of the kingdom, and
for re&s;toring and pre&s;erving the peace of Europe. Though
a debate en&s;ued upon this me&s;&s;age, the majority re&s;olved
that an addre&s;s &s;hould be pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty, de|claring
the duty and fidelity of the Commons, their entire
confidence in his royal care and goodne&s;s, and their readi|ne&s;s
to enable his Maje&s;ty to fulfil his engagements. A
vote of credit pa&s;&s;ed accordingly. During this &s;e&s;&s;ion,
the peers were chiefly employed in examining copies of
&s;everal treaties and alliances which the King &s;ubmitted to
<PB N="437" REF="443">
their peru&s;al;<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. IV. 1728.</NOTE> they likewi&s;e prepared a bill for amending
the &s;tatute of limitation, which, however, did not pa&s;s into
a law: they con&s;idered the &s;tate of the national debt; a
&s;ubject fruitful of debates: they pa&s;&s;ed the mutiny-bill,
and tho&s;e that were &s;ent up from the Commons, touching
the &s;upplies; together with an act, obliging &s;hips arriving
from infected places to perform quarantine; and &s;ome
others of a more private nature. The&s;e bills having re|ceived
the royal a&s;&s;ent, the King clo&s;ed the &s;e&s;&s;ion on the
twenty-eighth day of May, when he thanked the Commons
for the effectual &s;upplies they had rai&s;ed, and in particular,
for having empowered him to borrow five hundred thou|&s;and
pounds for the di&s;charge of wages due to the &s;eamen
employed in the navy.</P>
<P>&sect; VIII. England was at this period quite barren of re|markable
events. The King's uncle, Erne&s;t Augu&s;tus,
Prince of Brun&s;wick, Duke of York, and Bi&s;hop of
O&s;nabruck, died on the third day of Augu&s;t, and was
&s;ucceeded in the bi&s;hoprick by the Elector of Cologn,
according to the pactum by which O&s;nabruck is alter|nately
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the hou&s;e of Brun&s;wick and that
Elector. In the beginning of December, his Maje&s;ty's
elde&s;t &s;on Prince Frederick arrived in England from Hano|ver,
where he had hitherto re&s;ided, was introduced into
the privy-council, and created Prince of Wales. Signior
Como, re&s;ident from the Duke of Parma, was ordered to
quit the kingdom, becau&s;e his ma&s;ter paid to the Pretender
the honours due to the King of Great-Britain. The
congre&s;s opened at Soi&s;&s;ons, for determining all di&s;putes
among the powers of Europe, proved ineffectual. Such
difficulties occurred in &s;ettling and reconciling &s;o many
different preten&s;ions and intere&s;ts, that the contracting
parties in the alliance of Hanover propo&s;ed a provi&s;ional
treaty, concerning which no definitive an&s;wer was given
as yet by the courts of Vienna and Madrid. The fate of
Europe, therefore, continued in &s;u&s;pen&s;e: the Engli&s;h
fleet lay inactive and rotting in the We&s;t-Indies: the
&s;ailors peri&s;hed mi&s;erably, without daring to avenge their
<PB N="438" REF="444">
country's wrongs; while the Spani&s;h crui&s;ers committed
depredations with impunity on the commerce of Great-Britain.
The court of Spain, at this juncture, &s;eemed
cold and indifferent with regard to a pacification with Eng|land.
It had renewed a good under&s;tanding with France,
and now &s;trengthened its intere&s;t by a double alliance of
marriage with the royal family of Portugal. The Infanta
of this hou&s;e was betrothed to the Prince of A&s;turias:
while the Spani&s;h Infanta, formerly affianced to the French
King, was now matched with the Prince of Bra&s;il, elde&s;t
&s;on of his Portugue&s;e Maje&s;ty. In the month of Janu|ary,
the two courts met in a wooden hou&s;e built over the
little river Coya, that &s;eparates the two kingdoms, and
there the prince&s;&s;es were exchanged.</P>
<P>&sect; IX. The parliament of Great-Britain meeting accord|ing
to their la&s;t prorogation on the twenty-fir&s;t day of
January, the King in his &s;peech communicated the nature
of the negociation at the congre&s;s. He demanded &s;uch
&s;upplies as might enable him to act vigorou&s;ly in concert
with his allies, provided his endeavours to e&s;tabli&s;h an ad|vantageous
peace &s;hould mi&s;carry: and he hinted, that the
dilatory conduct of the courts of Vienna and Madrid pro|ceeded
in a great mea&s;ure from the hopes that were given,
of creating di&s;contents and divi&s;ions among the &s;ubjects
of Great-Britain. This &s;ugge&s;tion was a mini&s;terial arti|fice
to inflame the zeal and re&s;entment of the nation, and
intimidate the members in the oppo&s;ition. Accord|ingly
the hint was pur&s;ued, and in the addre&s;&s;es from
both Hou&s;es, that could not fail of being agreeable, con|&s;idering
the manner in which they were dictated, particu|lar
notice was taken of this article: both Peers and Com|mons
expre&s;&s;ed their dete&s;tation and abhorrence of tho&s;e,
who, by &s;uch ba&s;e and unnatural artifices, &s;ugge&s;ted the
means of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing their country, and clamoured at the
inconveniencies which they them&s;elves had occa&s;ioned.
In the&s;e addre&s;&s;es, likewi&s;e, the parliament congratulated
his Maje&s;ty on the arrival of the Prince of Wales in his
Briti&s;h dominions; and the Commons &s;ent a particular
<PB N="439" REF="445">
compliment to his royal highne&s;s on that occa&s;ion. The
e&s;timates having been examined in the u&s;ual form, the
Hou&s;e voted fifteen thou&s;and &s;eamen for the en&s;uing year:
but the motion for continuing the &s;ame number of land|forces
which had been allowed in the preceding year, was
not carried without di&s;pute. All the arguments again&s;t a
&s;tanding army in time of peace, as incon&s;i&s;tent with the
Briti&s;h con&s;titution, and dangerous to the liberties of the
people, were repeated with great vivacity by Mr. Shippen
and Mr. W. Pulteney. The&s;e, however, were an&s;wered,
and repre&s;ented as ab&s;urd, by Mr. Horatio Walpole and
Mr. D. two &s;taunch adherents of the mini&s;ter. The fir&s;t
had, in de&s;pite of nature, been employed in different ne|gociations:
he was blunt, aukward, and &s;lovenly: an orator
without eloquence, an amba&s;&s;ador without dignity, and a
plenipotentiary without addre&s;s. The other had natural
parts and acquired knowledge; &s;poke with confidence; and
in di&s;pute was vain, &s;arca&s;tick, petulant, and verbo&s;e.</P>
<P>&sect; X. The &s;ub&s;idies to Sweden, He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el, and Wol|fenbuttel
were continued, notwith&s;tanding the remon|&s;trances
of Sir Jo&s;eph Jekyll, Mr. Lutwyche, and Mr.
Pulteney; which la&s;t ob&s;erved, that as the Landgrave of
He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el, and the Duke of Brun&s;wick Wolfenbuttel,
u&s;ually maintained a certain number of troops in their
pay, it was but rea&s;onable that Great-Britain &s;hould de|fray
no more than the expen&s;e of the additional forces
which tho&s;e powers had rai&s;ed, in con&s;equence of their
conventions with the King of England. Sir Robert
Walpole perceiving that this remark made an impre&s;&s;ion
on the Hou&s;e, thought it nece&s;&s;ary to vindicate his mea|&s;ure:
he expatiated upon the wi&s;dom of the late King, in
concluding the Hanover alliance. He affirmed that the
convention with He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el had prevented a war in the
empire, for which the court of Vienna had made great
preparations: that the Emperor had not only augmented
his own forces by the help of Spani&s;h subsidies, but al&s;o
retained the troops of three electors; and if he had not
<PB N="440" REF="446">
been over-awed by the He&s;&s;ians, would certainly have re|jected
the preliminaries, and all other advances towards a
pacification: that, therefore, they ought not to grudge an
expen&s;e which had already proved &s;o beneficial to the tran|quillity
of Europe. Sir Jo&s;eph Jekyll replied, that what|ever
glo&s;s might be put upon &s;uch mea&s;ures, they were re|pugnant
to the maxims by which England in former times
had &s;teered and &s;quared its conduct with relation to its
intere&s;t abroad: that the navy was the natural &s;trength of
Great-Britain&mdash;its be&s;t defence and &s;ecurity: but if, in or|der
to avoid a war, they &s;hould be &s;o free-hearted as to buy
and maintain the forces of foreign princes, they were ne|ver
like to &s;ee an end of &s;uch extravagant expen&s;es.
This gentleman, who exerci&s;ed the office of ma&s;ter of the
Rolls, had approved him&s;elf a zealous defender of Whig
principles, was an able lawyer, a &s;en&s;ible &s;peaker, and a
con&s;cientious patriot. The &s;upplies were rai&s;ed by a con|tinuation
of the land-tax, the duties upon malt, cyder, and
perry, an additional impo&s;ition on unmalted corn u&s;ed in
di&s;tilling, and by &s;ale of annuities to the Bank not exceed|ing
fifty thou&s;and pounds per annum.</P>
<P>&sect; XI. Petitions were delivered to the Hou&s;e of Commons
from the merchants of London, Liverpool, and Bri&s;tol,
complaining of the interruptions they had &s;uffered in their
trade for &s;everal years, by the depredations of the Spaniards
in the We&s;t-Indies. The&s;e being con&s;idered, the Hou&s;e
ordered the lords of the Admiralty to produce the other
memorials of the &s;ame kind which they had received, that
they might be laid before the congre&s;s at Soi&s;&s;ons: then
they addre&s;&s;ed his Maje&s;ty for copies of all the letters and
in&s;tructions which had been &s;ent to Admiral Ho&s;ier, and
tho&s;e who &s;ucceeded him in the command of the We&s;t-India
&s;quadron. Mr. Oglethorpe having been informed
of &s;hocking cruelties and oppre&s;&s;ions exerci&s;ed by gaolers
upon their pri&s;oners, moved for an examination into the&s;e
practices, and was cho&s;en chairman of a committee ap|pointed
to enquire into the &s;tate of the goals of the king|dom.
They began with the Fleet-pri&s;on, which they
<PB N="441" REF="447">
vi&s;ited in a body: there they found Sir William Rich, Ba|ronet,
loaded with irons, by order of Bambridge the war|den,
to whom he had given &s;ome &s;light cau&s;e of offence.
They made a di&s;covery of many inhuman barbarities, which
had been committed by that ruffian, and detected the mo&s;t
iniquitous &s;cenes of fraud, villainy, and extortion. When
the report was made by the committee, the Hou&s;e unani|mou&s;ly
re&s;olved, that Thomas Bambridge, acting warden
of the Fleet, had wilfully permitted &s;everal debtors to
e&s;cape; had been guilty of the mo&s;t notorious breaches of
tru&s;t, great extortions, and the highe&s;t crimes and mi&s;de|meanours
in the execution of his office; that he had arbi|trarily
and unlawfully loaded with irons, put into dun|geons,
and de&s;troyed pri&s;oners for debt, under his charge,
treating them in the mo&s;t barbarous and cruel manner, in
high violation and contempt of the laws of the kingdom.
John Huggins, E&s;quire, who had been warden of the Fleet|pri&s;on,
was &s;ubjected to a re&s;olution of the &s;ame nature.
The Hou&s;e pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the King, de&s;iring he
would direct his attorney-general forthwith to pro&s;ecute
the&s;e per&s;ons and their accomplices, who were committed
pri&s;oners to Newgate. A bill was brought in, di&s;abling
Bambridge to execute the office of warden; another for
the better regulating the pri&s;on of the Fleet; and for more
effectually preventing and puni&s;hing arbitrary and illegal
practices of the warden of the &s;aid pri&s;on<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">It afterwards appeared that &s;ome of the members of this inque&s;t were $$lu|ated by other motives than tho&s;e they profe&s;&s;ed; and the committee was &s;uf|fered to &s;ink into oblivion.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>&sect; XII. Other merchants complained by petition of the
lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;tained by the Spaniards. The Hou&s;e, in a grand
committee, deliberated on this &s;ubject, enquired into the
particulars, examined evidence, and drew up an addre&s;s to
the King, de&s;iring his Maje&s;ty would be graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed
to u&s;e his utmo&s;t endeavours for preventing &s;uch depre|dations:
for procuring ju&s;t and rea&s;onable &s;ati&s;faction;
and for &s;ecuring to his &s;ubjects the free exerci&s;e of com|merce
and navigation to and from the Briti&s;h colonies in
<PB N="442" REF="448">
America. The King an&s;wered them he would u&s;e his be&s;t
endeavours to an&s;wer the de&s;ires and expectations of his
people, in an affair of &s;o much importance; and they, in
another addre&s;s, thanked him for his gracious an&s;wer.
They did not, however, receive &s;uch a &s;ati&s;factory reply
to a former addre&s;s, touching the &s;um of &s;ixty thou&s;and
pounds that had been &s;tated in the publick account, with|out
&s;pecification of the particular u&s;es to which it was ap|plied.
His Maje&s;ty gave them to under&s;tand that the mo|ney
had been i&s;&s;ued and di&s;bur&s;ed for &s;ecret &s;ervices; and
that a di&s;tinct and particular acconnt of the di&s;tribution
of it could not be given without a manife&s;t prejudice to
the publick. A bill was prepared for the more effectual
preventing bribery and corruption in elections for members
of parliament; and it pa&s;&s;ed through the Hou&s;e without
oppo&s;ition; but their attention was chiefly employed upon
the Spani&s;h depredations, which had rai&s;ed a great clamour
through the whole kingdom, and excited very warm di&s;|putes
in parliament; for they were generally reputed the
fruits of negligence, incapacity, or want of vigour in the
mini&s;ters. The Commons having made further progre&s;s
in the enquiry, and received fre&s;h petitions from the mer|chants,
pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome re&s;olutions, in which the Spaniards
were accu&s;ed of having violated the treaties &s;ub&s;i&s;ting be|tween
the two crowns; and with having treated inhumanly
the ma&s;ters and crews of &s;hips belonging to Great-Britain.
They ju&s;tified the in&s;tructions given to Admiral Ho&s;ier, to
&s;ei&s;e and detain the &s;$ota and galleons of Spain, until ju&s;tice
and &s;atisfaction &s;hould be rendered to his Maje&s;ty and his
allies; nay, even declared that &s;uch &s;ei&s;ure would have been
ju&s;t, prudent, and nece&s;&s;ary, tending to prevent an open
rupture, and to pre&s;erve the peace and tranquillity of Eu|rope.
They again addre&s;&s;ed the King to u&s;e his endeavours
to procure &s;ati&s;faction; and he promi&s;ed to comply
with their reque&s;t.</P>
<P>&sect; XIII. Mr. Scroope, member for Bri&s;tol, moved for
an addre&s;s, entreating his Maje&s;ty to order an account of
the produce of the civil-li&s;t revenues for one year to be
<PB N="443" REF="449">
laid before the Hou&s;e. The addre&s;s was pre&s;ented, the
account produced, and the Hou&s;e, in a grand committee,
took this affair into con&s;ideration. The courtiers affirmed
that they fell &s;hort of the eight hundred thou&s;and pounds
&s;ettled upon his Maje&s;ty; and Mr. Scroope propo&s;ed that
the &s;um of one hundred and fifteen thou&s;and pounds &s;hould
be granted to the King, on account of tho&s;e deficiencies
and arrears. The motion was vigorou&s;ly oppo&s;ed by Mr.
Pulteney and other members. They expre&s;&s;ed their &s;ur|pri&s;e
that it &s;hould be made &s;o late in the &s;e&s;&s;ion, when
no further demand of money could be rea&s;onably expected;
and they &s;aid it was the more extraordinary, becau&s;e it ap|peared
in the former &s;e&s;&s;ion, from the examination of the
accounts then before the Hou&s;e, that the revenues of the
civil-li&s;t produced yearly a much greater &s;um than that for
which they were given. Mr. Pulteney moved that the ac|counts
and papers &s;hould be referred to the examination of
a &s;elect committee, properly empowered to inve&s;tigate the
truth. The mini&s;ters oppo&s;ed this motion; and the que&s;|tion
being put, it pa&s;&s;ed in the negative. The majority
voted the &s;um demanded; and in a bill for &s;ettling the
price of imported corn, they in&s;erted the re&s;olution for
granting to his Maje&s;ty the &s;um of one hundred and fifteen
thou&s;and pounds, on account of arrears due on the civil|li&s;t
revenues.</P>
<P>&sect; XIV. The Hou&s;e of Lords having prepared a bill for
the more effectual puni&s;hment of forgery, which was pa&s;&s;ed
into a law, and ordered the judges to bring in another,
on the report of a committee appointed to con&s;ider the ca&s;e
of impri&s;oned debtors, at length deliberated upon the &s;tate
of the nation, particularly the po&s;itive demand made by
the court of Spain for the re&s;titution of Gibraltar, grounded
on a letter written by the late king to his Catholick Ma|je&s;ty.
From a copy of the letter laid before the Hou&s;e, it
plainly appeared that King George I. had con&s;ented to
this re&s;titution. A motion being made for a re&s;olution,
importing, that for the honour of his Maje&s;ty, and the
pre&s;ervation and &s;ecurity of the trade and commerce of
<PB N="444" REF="450">
the kingdom, effectual care &s;hould be taken in the pre&s;ent
treaty that the King of Spain &s;hould renounce all claim
and preten&s;ion to Gibraltar and Minorca, in plain and
&s;trong terms, a debate en&s;ued, and the que&s;tion being, put,
pa&s;&s;ed in the negative, though not without a prote&s;t. Then
the majority, re&s;olved, that the Hou&s;e did entirely rely upon
his Maje&s;ty, that he would, for maintaining the honour
and &s;ecuring the trade of this kingdom, take effectual care
in the pre&s;ent treaty to pre&s;erve his undoubted right to
Gibraltar and Minorca. When the Hou&s;e examined the
papers relating to the Spani&s;h depredations, many &s;evere
reflexions were uttered again&s;t the conduct of the mini&s;try;
and a motion was made, to re&s;olve that Ho&s;ier's expedition
was an unrea&s;onable burthen on the nation: but this too
was rejected, and occa&s;ioned another prote&s;t. Nor did the
clau&s;e in the corn-bill, for granting one hundred and
fifteen thou&s;and pounds to his Maje&s;ty, pa&s;s through the
Hou&s;e of Peers without warm oppo&s;ition. Divers lords
alledged, that, in&s;tead of a deficiency in the civil-li&s;t reve|nues,
there was a con&s;iderable &s;urplus: that this was a
new grant, and a new burthen on the people: that the
nation was loaded, not to complete, but to augment the
&s;um de&s;igned for the civil-li&s;t; and this at a time when
the publick debts were increa&s;ed; when the taxes were
heavily felt in all parts of the country; when the foreign
trade of Britain was incumbered and dimini&s;hed; when
her manufactures were decayed; her poor multiplied; and
&s;he was &s;urrounded by many other national calamities.
They ob&s;erved, that if the produce of the civil-li&s;t revenue
&s;hould not amount to the yearly &s;um of eight hundred
thou&s;and pounds, the deficiency mu&s;t be made good to
his Maje&s;ty by the publick; whereas no provi&s;ion was
made, by which, if the produce of the&s;e revennes &s;hould
exceed that &s;um, the &s;urplus could accrue to the benefit
of the public: that, by this precedent, not only real de|ficiencies
were to be made good, but al&s;o &s;upplies were to
be given for arrears &s;tanding out at the end of every
year, which &s;hould come on before the &s;upplies could be
<PB N="445" REF="451">
granted, though the &s;upply given to make good arrears in
one year would certainly increa&s;e the &s;urplu&s;ages in an|other:
that the revenues of the civil-li&s;t were variable in
their own nature; and even when there is a deficiency
in the produce, there might be arrears in the receipt:
the&s;e might be ea&s;ily increa&s;ed by the management of de|&s;igning
mini&s;ters, by private directions to receivers, and
by artful methods of &s;tating accounts. All the&s;e argu|ments,
and other objections equally &s;trong and plau&s;ible,
again&s;t this uncon&s;cionable and unparliamentary motion,
&s;erved only to evince the triumph of the mini&s;try over
&s;hame and &s;entiment, their contempt of public &s;pirit, and
their defiance of national reproach.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The peers that di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in the oppo&s;ition were Beaufort, Strafford, Craven, Foley, Lichfield, Scar&s;dale, Gower, Mountjoy, Plymouth, Bathur&s;t, Northampton, Coventry, Oxford and Mortimer, Willoughby de Broke, Boyle, and Warrington.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>&sect; XV.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1729.</NOTE> The King had, on the twenty-fourth day of
March, given the royal a&s;&s;ent to five bills; and on the
fourteenth day of May, the &s;ame &s;anction was given to
thirty other bills, including an act, enabling the Queen
to be regent in the kingdom during his Maje&s;ty's ab&s;ence,
without taking the oaths; and another for the relief of
in&s;olvent debtors. At the &s;ame time two-and-thirty pri|vate
bills were pa&s;&s;ed: then the King expre&s;&s;ed his ap|probation
of the parliament, &s;ignified his intention to
vi&s;it his German dominions, and ordered the Chancellor
to prorogue both Hou&s;es. His Maje&s;ty having appointed
the Queen regent of the realm, &s;et out for Hanover, on
the &s;eventeenth day of May, in order to remove a petty
mi&s;under&s;tanding which had happened between that elec|torate
and the court of Berlin. Some Hanoverian &s;ubjects
had been pre&s;&s;ed or decoyed into the &s;ervice of Pru&s;&s;ia;
and the regents of Hanover had &s;ei&s;ed certain Pru&s;&s;ian
officers, by way of repri&s;al. The whole united kingdom
of Great-Britain at this juncture enjoyed uninterrupted
repo&s;e; and commerce continued to increa&s;e, in &s;pite of
all re&s;triction and di&s;couragement. The people of Ireland
found them&s;elves happy under the government of Lord
<PB N="446" REF="452">
Carteret;<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1729.</NOTE> and their parliament, a&s;&s;embling in the month
of September, approved them&s;elves the fathers of their
country. They e&s;tabli&s;hed funds for the di&s;charge of their
national debt, and for maintaining the expen&s;e of govern|ment:
they enacted whole&s;ome laws for the encourage|ment
of manufactures, trade, and agriculture; and they
formed wi&s;e regulations in different branches of civil
oeconomy. Some time after this &s;e&s;&s;ion, which was con|ducted
with &s;o much harmony and patrioti&s;m, Lord Car|teret
returned to England; and was &s;ucceeded by the
Duke of Dor&s;et in the government of that kingdom. In
the month of May, Charles Lord Town&s;hend re&s;igned the
&s;eals, which were given to Colonel Standhope, now created
Earl of Harrington; &s;o that Sir R. W. now reigned
without a rival. James Earl of Waldegrave was appointed
amba&s;&s;ador to the court of France, which, about that time,
was filled with joy by the birth of a dauphin.</P>
<P>&sect; XVI. In the month of September, Victor Amadeus,
King of Sardinia, re&s;igned his crown to his &s;on Charles
Emanuel, Prince of Piedmont. The father re&s;erved to
him&s;elf a revenue of one hundred thou&s;and pi&s;toles per
annum, retired to the ca&s;tle of Chamberry, and e&s;pou&s;ed
the Counte&s;s Dowager of St. Seba&s;tian, who declined the
title of queen, but a&s;&s;umed that of Marchione&s;s of So|merive.
Though the congre&s;s at Soi&s;&s;ons proved abor|tive,
conferences were begun at Seville, between the ple|nipotentiaries
of England, France, and Spain; and a
treaty was concluded on the ninth day of November, not
only without the concurrence of the Emperor, but even
contrary to his right, as e&s;tabli&s;hed by the quadruple al|liance.
On this &s;ubject he communicated an imperial
commi&s;&s;orial decree to the &s;tates of the empire a&s;&s;embled in
the diet at Rati&s;bon, which was an&s;wered by the French
mini&s;ter De Chavigny. In October Peter II. Czar of
Mu&s;covy, and grand&s;on of Peter I. died in the fifteenth
year of his age, at Mo&s;cow, and was &s;ucceeded on the
Ru&s;&s;ian throne by the Prince&s;s Anne Ivanowna, &s;econd
daughter of John Alexowitz, elder brother of the fir&s;t
<PB N="447" REF="453">
Peter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. IV. 1729.</NOTE> and widow of Frederick William Duke of Cour|land.
The following month was rendered remarkable by
the death of Pope Benedict XIII. in who&s;e room Cardinal
Laurence Cor&s;ini was rai&s;ed to the pontificate, and a&s;&s;umed
the name of Clement XII.</P>
<P>&sect; XVII. The Briti&s;h parliament a&s;&s;embling on the
thirteenth day of January, the King gave them to under|&s;tand,
that the peace of Europe was now e&s;tabli&s;hed by the
treaty of Seville, built upon the foundation of former
treaties, and tending to render more effectual what the
contracting powers in the quadruple alliance were before
engaged to &s;ee performed. He a&s;&s;ured them that all former
conventions made with Spain in favour of the Briti&s;h
trade and navigation were renewed and confirmed: that
the free uninterrupted exerci&s;e of their commerce was
re&s;tored: that the court of Spain had agreed to an ample
re&s;titution and reparation for unlawful &s;ei&s;ures and depre|dations:
that all rights, privileges, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, belong|ing
to him and his allies, were &s;olemnly re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, con|firmed,
and guaranteed; and that not one conce&s;&s;ion was
made to the prejudice of his &s;ubjects. He told them he
had given orders for reducing a great number of his land-forces,
and for laying up great part of the fleet; and
ob&s;erved that there would be a con&s;iderable &s;aving in the
expen&s;e of the current year. After both Hou&s;es had pre|&s;ented
their addre&s;&s;es of thanks and congratulation to the
King on the peace of Seville, the Lords took that treaty
into con&s;ideration, and it did not pa&s;s enquiry without
&s;evere animadver&s;ion.</P>
<P>&sect; XVIII. The lords in the oppo&s;ition excepted to the ar|ticle
by which the merchants of Great-Britain were
obliged to make proof of their lo&s;&s;es at the court of Spain.
They &s;aid this &s;tipulation was a hard&s;hip upon Briti&s;h &s;ub|jects,
and di&s;honourable to the nation: that few would care
to undertake &s;uch a trouble&s;ome and expen&s;ive journey, e&s;|pecially
as they had rea&s;on to apprehend their claims
would be counterbalanced by the Spaniards; and, after
all, they would have no more but the &s;lender comfort of
<PB N="448" REF="454">
hoping to obtain that redre&s;s by commi&s;&s;aries which they
had not been able to procure by plenipotentiaries. They
thought it very extraordinary, that Great-Britain &s;hould
be bound to ratify and guarantee whatever agreement
&s;hould be made between the King of Spain and the Dukes
of Parma and Tu&s;cany, concerning the garri&s;ons once
e&s;tabli&s;hed in their countries: that the Engli&s;h &s;hould be
obliged to a&s;&s;i&s;t in effectuating the introduction of &s;ix
thou&s;and Spani&s;h troops into the towns of Tu&s;cany and
Parma, without any &s;pecification of the methods to be
taken, or the charge to be incurred in giving that a&s;&s;i&s;tance:
that they &s;hould guarantee for ever, not only to Don
Carlos, but even to all his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
e&s;tates of Tu&s;cany and Parma; a &s;tipulation which in all
probability would involve Great-Britain in endle&s;s quarrels
and di&s;putes, about a country with which they had no
concern. They affirmed that the treaty of Seville, in&s;tead
of confirming other treaties, was contradictory to the
quadruple alliance, particularly in the article of intro|ducing
Spani&s;h troops into Tu&s;cany and Parma, in the
room of neutral forces &s;tipulated by the former alliance;
and agreeing that they &s;hould there remain until Don
Carlos and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors &s;hould be &s;ecure and exempt
from all events. They complained that the&s;e alterations,
from the tenour of the quadruple alliance were made
without the concurrence of the Emperor, and even with|out
inviting him to accede; an affront which might
alienate his friend&s;hip from England, and hazard the lo&s;s
of &s;uch an ancient, powerful, and faithful ally: they de|clared
that throughout the whole treaty there &s;eemed to be
an artful omi&s;&s;ion of any expre&s;s &s;tipulation, to &s;ecure
Great-Britain in her right to Gibraltar and Minorca.
Such was the &s;ub&s;tance of the objections made to the peace:
then Lord Bathur&s;t moved for a re&s;olution, that the agree|ment
on the treaty of Seville, to &s;ecure the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of
Don Carlos to the duchies of Tu&s;cany, Parma, and Pla|centia,
with Spani&s;h troops, was a manife&s;t violation of
the fifth article of the quadruple alliance, tending to
<PB N="449" REF="455">
involve the nation in a dangerous and expen&s;ive war, and
to de&s;troy the balance of power in Europe. The que&s;tion
was put, and the motion rejected. Such too was the fate
of two other motions, to re&s;olve that Great-Britain's
right of &s;overeignty, dominion, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and claim to
Gibraltar and Minorca were not a&s;certained by the treaty
of Seville; and that the &s;tipulations in that treaty for
repairing the lo&s;&s;es of the Briti&s;h merchants were in&s;uf|ficient
and precarious. The majority, far from &s;tigma|ti&s;ing
this tran&s;action, re&s;olved that the treaty did contain
all nece&s;&s;ary &s;tipulations for maintaining and &s;ecuring the
honour, dignity, rights, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the crown: that
all due care was taken therein for the &s;upport of the trade
of the kingdom, and for repairing the lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;tained by
the Briti&s;h merchants. On the&s;e re&s;olutions an addre&s;s of
approbation was founded: but, when a motion was made
for an addre&s;s to his Maje&s;ty, that he would order to be
laid before the Hou&s;e a li&s;t of all pen&s;ions payable to the
crown, it was immediately re&s;olved in the negative. Divers
conte&s;ts of the &s;ame kind aro&s;e upon the mutiny-bill, the
pen&s;ion-bill, and the maintenance of the twelve thou&s;and
He&s;&s;ians; but the mini&s;try bore down all oppo&s;ition,
though their triumphs were clogged with vigorous prote&s;ts,
which did not fail to make impre&s;&s;ion upon the body of the
people.</P>
<P>&sect; XIX. Nor was the &s;ucce&s;s of the court intere&s;t in the
Hou&s;e of Commons altogether pure, and free from excep|tion
and di&s;pute. When the charge of the land-forces
fell under the con&s;ideration of the Commons, and Mr.
Henry Pelham, &s;ecretary at war, moved that the number
of the effective men for the land-&s;ervice of the en&s;uing
year &s;hould be fixed at &s;eventeen thou&s;and &s;even hundred
and nine, Mr. Pulteney in&s;i&s;ted upon its being reduced to
twelve thou&s;and. Mr. Shippen affirmed that Mr. Pel|ham's
motion was a flat negative to the addre&s;s for which
he voted on the fir&s;t day of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, as it plainly im|plied
a di&s;tru&s;t of the validity of the late treaty, which he
then a&s;&s;ured the Hou&s;e would immediately produce all
<PB N="450" REF="456">
the ble&s;&s;ings of an ab&s;olute peace; and deliver the king|dom
from the apprehen&s;ions and inconveniencies of a
war. He &s;aid the motion tended directly towards the
e&s;tabli&s;hment of an army in Great-Britain, which he hop|ed
would never be &s;o far Germani&s;ed, as tamely to &s;ubmit
to a military government. He ob&s;erved that the nation
could have no occa&s;ion for all the troops that were demand|ed,
con&s;idering the glorious &s;cene of affairs which was
now opened to all Europe. &startq;They are not nece&s;&s;ary (&s;aid
he) to awe Spain into a firm adherence to its own trea|ty:
they are not nece&s;&s;ary to force the Emperor into an
immediate acce&s;&s;ion; nor are they in any &s;ort nece&s;&s;ary
for the &s;afety of his Maje&s;ty's per&s;on and government.
Force and violence are the re&s;ort of u&s;urpers and tyrants
only; becau&s;e they are, with good rea&s;on, di&s;tru&s;tful of
the people whom they oppre&s;s; and becau&s;e they have
no other &s;ecurity for the continuance of their unlawful
and unnatural dominion, than what depends entirely on
the &s;trength of their armies.&endq; The motion, however,
was carried in the affirmative.</P>
<P>&sect; XX. Another warm debate was excited by a bill
which the courtiers brought in, to prevent any &s;ubjects of
Great-Britain from advancing &s;ums of money to foreign
princes or &s;tates, without having obtained licen&s;e from
his Maje&s;ty, under his privy-&s;eal, or &s;ome greater authority.
The mini&s;ter pretended that this law was propo&s;ed to di&s;|able
the Emperor, who wanted to borrow a great &s;um of
the Engli&s;h merchants, for rai&s;ing and maintaining troops
to di&s;turb the tranquillity of Europe. The bill contained
a clau&s;e, empowering the King to prohibit by proclamation
all &s;uch loans of money, jewels, or bullion: the Attorney-General
was empowered to compel, by Engli&s;h bill, in the
court of Exchequer, the effectual di&s;covery, on oath, of
any &s;uch loans; and it was enacted, that in default of an
an&s;wer to any &s;uch bill, the court &s;hould decree a limited
&s;um again&s;t the per&s;on refu&s;ing to an&s;wer. Mr. Daniel
Pulteney, a gentleman of uncommon talents and ability,
and particularly acquainted with every branch of commerce,
<PB N="451" REF="457">
argued &s;trenuou&s;ly again&s;t this bill, as a re&s;traint upon
trade that would render Holland the market of Europe,
and the mart of money to the nations of the continent.
He &s;aid, that by this general prohibition, extending to all
princes, &s;tates, or potentates, the Engli&s;h were totally
di&s;abled from a&s;&s;i&s;ting their be&s;t allies: that among others
the King of Portugal frequently borrowed money of the
Engli&s;h merchants re&s;iding within his dominions: that
while the licen&s;ing power remained in the crown, the
licen&s;es would be i&s;&s;ued through the hands of the mini&s;ter,
who by this new trade might gain twenty, thirty, or
forty thou&s;and a-year; that the bill would render the Ex|chequer
a court of inqui&s;ition; and that whil&s;t it re&s;train|ed
our merchants from a&s;&s;i&s;ting the princes and powers of
Europe, it permitted our &s;tock-jobbers to trade in their
funds without interruption. Other arguments of equal
weight were enforced by Mr. Barnard, a merchant of Lon|don,
who perfectly under&s;tood trade in all its branches,
&s;poke with judgment and preci&s;ion, and upon all occa|&s;ions
&s;teadily adhered to the intere&s;ts and liberties of his
country. After having explained his rea&s;ons, he declared
he &s;hould never con&s;ent to a bill which he deemed a vio|lation
of our fundamental laws, a breach of our deare&s;t
liberties, and a very terrible hard&s;hip on mankind. Sir
William Wyndham di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf on the &s;ame &s;ide
of the que&s;tion. The bill was vindicated by Sir Robert
Walpole, Mr. Pelham, and Sir Philip Yorke, attorney-ge|neral;
and being &s;upported by the whole weight of mini|&s;terial
influence, not only pa&s;&s;ed through the Hou&s;e, but
was afterwards enacted into a law.</P>
<P>&sect; XXI. The &s;ub&s;idies were continued to the Landgrave
of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el, and the Duke of Brun&s;wick-Wolfenbuttel,
in &s;pite of all that could be urged again&s;t the&s;e extraneous
incumberances; and the &s;upply for the en&s;uing year was
granted according to the e&s;timates which the mini&s;try
thought proper to produce, amounting to about two mil|lions
two hundred and eighty thou&s;and pounds. It mu&s;t
be owned, however, for the credit of this &s;e&s;&s;ion, that the
Hou&s;e appropriated one million of the &s;urplu&s;es ari&s;ing
<PB N="452" REF="458">
from the &s;inking fund towards the di&s;charge of the national
debt; and by another act extingui&s;hed the duties upon
&s;alt, by which expedient the &s;ubject was ea&s;ed of a heavy
burthen, not only in being freed from the duty, but al&s;o
from a con&s;iderable charge of &s;alaries given to a great
number of officers employed to collect this impo&s;ition.
They likewi&s;e encouraged the colony of Carolina with an
act, allowing the planters and traders of that province to
export rice directly to any part of Europe &s;outhward of
Cape Fini&s;terre; and they permitted &s;alt from Europe to
be imported into the colony of New-York. The term of
the exclu&s;ive trade granted by act of parliament to the
Ea&s;t-India company drawing towards a period, many con|&s;iderable
merchants and others made application for being
incorporated and ve&s;ted with the privilege of trading to
tho&s;e countries, propo&s;ing to lay that branch of trade open
to all the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain, on certain conditions.
In con&s;ideration of an act of parliament for this purpo&s;e,
they offered to advance three millions two hundred thou|&s;and
pounds, for redeeming the fund and trade of the
pre&s;ent Ea&s;t-India company. This propo&s;al was rejected;
and the exclu&s;ive privilege ve&s;ted in the company was, by
act of parliament, protracted to the year one thou&s;and
&s;even hundred and &s;ixty-&s;ix, upon the following condi|tions:
That they &s;hould pay into the Exchequer the &s;um
of two hundred thou&s;and pounds towards the &s;upplies of
the year, without intere&s;t or addition to their capital &s;tock;
That the annuity or yearly fund of one hundred and &s;ixty
thou&s;and pounds, payable to them from the publick,
&s;hould be reduced to one hundred and twenty-eight thou|&s;and;
That after the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and
&s;ixty-&s;ix, their right to the exclu&s;ive trade &s;hould be liable
to be taken away by parliament, on three years notice, and
repayment of their capital.</P>
<P>&sect; XXII.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1730.</NOTE> On the fifteenth day of May the King went
to the Hou&s;e of Peers, and clo&s;ed the &s;e&s;&s;ion. In his
&s;peech he expre&s;&s;ed his joy, that, notwith&s;tanding all the
clamours which were rai&s;ed, the parliament had approved
of tho&s;e matters which fell under their con&s;ideration; a
<PB N="453" REF="459">
circum&s;tance which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. IV. 1730.</NOTE> he &s;aid, could not fail to in&s;pire all
mankind with a ju&s;t dete&s;tation of tho&s;e incendiaries, who,
by &s;candalous libels, laboured to alienate the affections of
his people; to fill their minds with groundle&s;s jealou&s;ies
and unju&s;t complaints, in di&s;honour of him and his govern|ment,
and in defiance of the &s;en&s;e of both Hou&s;es of par|liament<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In the cour&s;e of this &s;e&s;&s;ion the Commons pa&s;&s;ed a bill for making more effectual the laws in being, for di&s;abling per&s;ons from being cho&s;en members of parliament who enjoyed any pen&s;ion during plea&s;ure, or for any number of years, or any offices holden in tru&s;t for them, by obliging all per&s;ons hereafter to be cho&s;en to &s;erve for the Commons in parliament to take the oath therein mentioned. In all probability this bill would not have made its way through the Hou&s;e of Commons, had not the mini&s;ter been well a&s;&s;ured it would $word$ with the Upper-Hou&s;e, where it was rejected at the &s;econd reading, though not without violent oppo&s;ition.</NOTE>. The Emperor was &s;o much incen&s;ed at the
in&s;ult offered to him in the treaty of Seville, with re&s;pect
to the garri&s;ons of Tu&s;cany and Parma, that he prohibited
the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain from trading in his dominions:
he began to make preparations for war, and actually de|tached
bodies of troops to Italy, with &s;uch di&s;patch as
had been very &s;eldom exerted by the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria.
Yet the article of which he complained was not &s;o much
a real injury as an affront put upon the head of the empire;
for the eventual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to tho&s;e Italian duchies had
been &s;ecured to the Infant, Don Carlos, by the quadruple
alliance; and all that the Emperor required, was, that
this prince &s;hould receive the inve&s;titure of them as fiefs of
the empire.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIII. In Great-Britain, this year was not di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
by any tran&s;action of great moment. Seven chiefs
of the Cherokee nations of Indians in America were
brought to England by Sir Alexander Cumin. Being in|troduced
to the King, they laid their crown and regalia at
his feet; and by an authentick deed acknowledged them|&s;elves
&s;ubjects to his dominion, in the name of all their
compatriots, who had ve&s;ted them with full powers for
this purpo&s;e. They were amazed and confounded at the
riches and magnificence of the Briti&s;h court; they com|pared
the King and Queen to the Sun and Moon, the princes
<PB N="454" REF="460">
to the &s;tars of heaven, and them&s;elves to nothing.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1730.</NOTE> They
gave their a&s;&s;ent in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner to articles of
friend&s;hip and commerce, propo&s;ed by the lords commi&s;|&s;ioners
for trade and plantations; and being loaded with
pre&s;ents of nece&s;&s;aries, arms, and ammunition, were re|conveyed
to their own country, which borders on the pro|vince
of South-Carolina. In the month of September a
&s;urpri&s;ing revolution was effected at Con&s;tantinople, with|out
blood&s;hed or confu&s;ion. A few mean Jani&s;&s;aries
di&s;played a flag in the &s;treets, exclaiming that all true
Mu&s;&s;ulmen ought to follow them, and a&s;&s;i&s;t in reform|ing
the government. They &s;oon increa&s;ed to the number
of one hundred thou&s;and, marched to the Seraglio, and
demanded the Grand Vizir, the Kiaja, and Capitan
Pacha. The&s;e unhappy mini&s;ters were immediately
&s;trangled. Their bodies being delivered to the in&s;urgents,
were dragged through the &s;treets; and afterwards thrown
to the dogs to be devoured. Not contented with this
&s;acrifice, the revolters depo&s;ed the Grand Signor Achmet,
who was confined to the &s;ame pri&s;on from whence they
brought his nephew Machmut, and rai&s;ed this la&s;t to the
throne, after he had lived &s;even-and-twenty years in con|finement.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIV. England was at this period infe&s;ted with
robbers, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, and incendiaries, the natural con&s;e|quences
of degeneracy, corruption, and the want of police
in the interior government of the kingdom. This defect,
in a great mea&s;ure, aro&s;e from an ab&s;urd notion, that
laws nece&s;&s;ary to prevent tho&s;e acts of cruelty, violence,
and rapine would be incompatible with the liberty of
Briti&s;h &s;ubjects; a notion that confounds all di&s;tinctions
between liberty and brutal licentiou&s;ne&s;s, as if that free|dom
was de&s;ireable, in the enjoyment of which people find
no &s;ecurity for their lives or effects. The peculiar de|pravity
of the times was vi&s;ible even in the conduct of
tho&s;e who preyed upon the commonwealth. Thieves and
robbers were now become more de&s;perate and &s;avage than
ever they had appeared &s;ince mankind was civilized. In
the exerci&s;e of their rapine, they wounded, maimed, and
<PB N="455" REF="461">
even murthered the unhappy &s;ufferers, through a wanton|ne&s;s
of barbarity. They circulated letters, demanding &s;ums
of money from certain individuals, on pain of reducing
their hou&s;es to a&s;hes, and their families to ruin: and even
&s;et fire to the hou&s;e of a rich merchant in Bri&s;tol, who
had refu&s;ed to comply with their demand. The &s;ame &s;pe|cies
of villainy was practi&s;ed in different parts of the king|dom;
&s;o that the government was obliged to interpo&s;e, and
offer a con&s;iderable reward for di&s;covering the ruffians con|cerned
in &s;uch execrable de&s;igns.</P>
<P>&sect; XXV. In the &s;peech with which the King opened
the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament on the twenty-fir&s;t day of Janu|ary,
he told them, that the pre&s;ent critical conjucture
&s;eemed in a very particular manner to de&s;erve their at|tention:
that as the tran&s;actions then depending in the
&s;everal courts of Europe were upon the point of being
determined, the great event of peace or war might be very
much affected by their fir&s;t re&s;olutions, which were ex|pected
by different powers with great impatience. He
&s;aid, the continuance of that zeal and vigour with which
they had hitherto &s;upported him and his engagements
mu&s;t at this time be of the greate&s;t weight and importance,
both with regard to his allies, and to tho&s;e who might be
di&s;po&s;ed, before the &s;ea&s;on of action, to prevent by an
accommodation the fatal con&s;equences of a general rup|ture.
The former &s;cene was repeated. Both Hou&s;es, in
their addre&s;&s;es, promi&s;ed to &s;upport his Maje&s;ty in all his
engagements; yet the members in the oppo&s;ition demon|&s;trated
the ab&s;urdity of promi&s;ing to fulfil engagements,
before they could po&s;&s;ibly know whether or not they were
for the &s;ervice of Great-Britain. Another bill was brought
into the Hou&s;e of Commons, to prevent pen&s;ioners from
&s;itting as members of parliament; and, after a third read|ing,
carried up to the Lords for their concurrence. When
the &s;upply &s;ell under con&s;ideration, the debates were re|newed
upon the &s;ub&s;idies to the Landgrave of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el
and the Duke of Wol&s;enbuttel, which, however, were
continued; and every article was granted according to the
<PB N="456" REF="462">
e&s;timates given in for the expen&s;e of the en&s;uing year.
Two petitions being pre&s;ented to the Commons, repre|&s;enting
the delays of ju&s;tice, occa&s;ioned by the u&s;e of the
Latin tongue in proceedings at law, a bill was brought
in for changing this practice, and enacting, That all
tho&s;e proce&s;&s;es and pleadings &s;hould be entered in the
Engli&s;h language. Though one would imagine that very
little could be advanced again&s;t &s;uch a regulation, the
bill met with warm oppo&s;ition, on pretence that it would
render u&s;ele&s;s the ancient records which were written in
that language, and introduce confu&s;ion and delay of
ju&s;tice, by altering the e&s;tabli&s;hed form and method of
pleading: in &s;pite of the&s;e objections, it pa&s;&s;ed through
both Hou&s;es, and received the royal a&s;&s;ent. A great
number of merchants from different parts of the kingdom
having repeated their complaints of depredations and
cruelties committed by the Spaniards in the We&s;t-Indies,
their petitions were referred to the con&s;ideration of a grand
committee. Their complaints upon examination appeared
to be well founded. The Hou&s;e pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to
the King, de&s;iring his Maje&s;ty would be graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed
to continue his endeavour to prevent &s;uch depredations for
the future; to procure full &s;atisfaction for the damages
already &s;u&s;tained; and to &s;ecure to the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects the
full and uninterrupted exerci&s;e of their trade and navi|gation
to and from the Briti&s;h colonies in America. The
bill again&s;t pen&s;ions produced a warm debate in the Hou&s;e
of Lords, where it was violently oppo&s;ed by the Dukes of
Newca&s;tle and Argyl, the Earl of Ilay, and Dr. Sher|lock,
Bi&s;hop of Bangor. This prelate, in a remarkable
&s;peech, repre&s;ented it as a &s;cheme to enlarge the power of
the Hou&s;e of Commons, and to break the balance between
the powers e&s;&s;ential to the con&s;titution, &s;o as &s;ooner or
later to prove the ruin of the whole. The great barrier
provided again&s;t bribery and corruption by this bill con&s;i&s;ted
in an oath to be impo&s;ed on all members of the Lower
Hou&s;e, by which they mu&s;t have &s;olemnly &s;worn and de|clared,
that they had not directly, nor indirectly, any pen&s;ion
<PB N="457" REF="463">
during plea&s;ure, or for any number of years, or any office
in part, or in the whole, held for them, or for their benefit,
by any per&s;ons what&s;oever; and that they would not ac|cept
any &s;uch pen&s;ions or offices, without &s;ignifying the
&s;ame to the Hou&s;e within fourteen days after they &s;hould
be received or accepted. The bill was vindicated as ju&s;t
and nece&s;&s;ary by the Earls of Winchel&s;ea and Strafford,
Lord Bathur&s;t, and Lord Carteret, who had by this time
joined as an auxiliary in the oppo&s;ition.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Nothing was heard within doors in parliament, but &s;arca&s;tick repartee and violent decl$$nation between the two parties, who did not con&s;ine their altercation to the&s;e debates, but took the field again&s;t each other in periodical $apers, and occa&s;ional pamphlets. The paper called the Cra&s;$&s;man had already ri&s;en into high reputation all over England, for the wit, humour, and &s;olid rea&s;oning it contained. Some of the be&s;t writers in the oppo&s;ition, including Lord Bolingbroke and Mr. P. made u&s;e of this vehicle to convey their animadver&s;ions upon the mini&s;ter, who, on his &s;ide, employed the mo&s;t $tetched &s;cribblers to defend his conduct. It was in con&s;equence of two po|litical pamphlets, written in oppo&s;ition to each other, by Lord Hervey and Mr. P and &s;ome recrimination they produced in the Hou&s;e of Commons, that $span$ challenged the other to &s;imple combat, and had well nigh lo&s;t his $word$ in the duel, which was fought in $yde-Park.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVI.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1731.</NOTE> The Hou&s;e of Peers proceeded to con&s;ider
the &s;tate of the national debt; they read a bill for the free
importation of wool from Ireland into England, which
was fiercely oppo&s;ed, and laid a&s;ide, contrary to all the
rules of &s;ound policy. They pa&s;&s;ed the bill for carrying
on proceedings at law in the Engli&s;h language; and a
fruitle&s;s motion was made by Lord Bathur&s;t for an
addre&s;s, to de&s;ire his Maje&s;ty would give directions for
di&s;charging the He&s;&s;ian troops that were in the pay of
Great-Britain. On the &s;eventh day of May the parlia|ment
was prorogued, after the King had given them to
under&s;tand, that all apprehen&s;ions of war were now happily
removed, by a treaty &s;igned at Vienna between him and
the Emperor. He &s;aid it was communicated to the courts
of France and Spain, as parties to the treaty of Seville,
the execution of which it principally regarded; and that
it was likewi&s;e &s;ubmitted to the con&s;ideration of the States-General.
He ob&s;erved, that the conditions and engage|ments
<PB N="458" REF="464">
into which he had entered on this occa&s;ion were
agreeable to that nece&s;&s;ary concern which the Briti&s;h nation
mu&s;t always have for the &s;ecurity and pre&s;ervation of the
balance of power in Europe:<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1731.</NOTE> and that this happy turn,
duly improved with a ju&s;t regard to former alliances, yield|ed
a favourable pro&s;pect of &s;eeing the publick tranquillity
re-e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVII. In the month of January the Duke of Parma
died, after having made a will, in which he declared his
duche&s;s was three months advanced in her pregnancy;
entreating the allied powers of Europe to have compa&s;&s;ion
upon his people, and defer the execution of their projects
until his con&s;ort &s;hould be delivered. In ca&s;e the child
&s;hould be &s;till born, or die after the birth, he bequeathed
his dominions and allodial e&s;tates to the Infant Don Carlos
of Spain; and appointed five regents to govern the duchy.
Notwith&s;tanding this di&s;po&s;ition, a body of Imperial troops
immediately took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Parma and Placentia, under
the command of General Stampa, who declared they
&s;hould conduct them&s;elves with all po&s;&s;ible regularity and
moderation, and leave the admini&s;tration entirely to the
regents whom the Duke had appointed. They publickly
proclaimed in the market-place, that they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the&s;e duchies for the Infant, Don Carlos: and that if
the Duche&s;s Dowager &s;hould not be delivered of a prince,
the &s;aid Infant might receive the inve&s;titure from the Em|peror
whenever he would, provided he &s;hould come with|out
an army. Though the&s;e &s;teps &s;eemed to threaten an
immediate war, the King of Great-Britain and the States-General
interpo&s;ed their mediation &s;o effectu$lly with the
court of Vienna, that the Emperor de&s;i&s;ted from the pro|&s;ecution
of his de&s;ign; and on the &s;ixteenth day of March
concluded at Vienna a treaty with his Britannick Maje&s;ty,
by which he con&s;ented to withdraw his troops from Parma
and Placentia. He agreed, That the King of Spain might
take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e places in favour of his &s;on. Do$
Carlos, according to the treaty of Seville. He likewi&s;e
agreed, That the O&s;tend company, which had given
<PB N="459" REF="465">
&s;uch umbrage to the maritime powers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. IV. 1731.</NOTE> &s;hould be totally
di&s;&s;olved, on condition that the contracting powers con|cerned
in the treaty of Seville &s;hould guarantee the prag|matick
&s;anction, or &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the Au&s;trian hereditary
dominions to the heirs female of the Emperor, in ca&s;e he
&s;hould die without male i&s;&s;ue. The Dutch mini&s;ter re|&s;iding
at the Imperial court did not &s;ub&s;cribe this treaty,
becau&s;e, by the maxims received in that republick, and
the nature of her government, he could not be ve&s;ted with
full powers &s;o &s;oon as it would have been nece&s;&s;ary: never|thele&s;s,
the States-General were, by a &s;eparate article, ex|pre&s;sly
named as a principal contracting party.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVIII. On the twenty-&s;econd day of July a new
treaty was &s;igned at Vienna between the Emperor and the
Kings of Great-Britain and Spain, tending to confirm the
former. In Augu&s;t a treaty of union and defen&s;ive alliance
between the electorates of Saxony and Hanover was
executed at Dre&s;den. The court of Spain expre&s;&s;ing &s;ome
doubts with regard to the pregnancy of the Duche&s;s of
Parma, &s;he underwent a formal examination by five mid|wives
of different nations, in pre&s;ence of the older Duche&s;s
Dowager, &s;everal ladies of quality, three phy&s;icians, and a
&s;urgeon; and was declared with child: neverthele&s;s,
after having kept all Europe in &s;u&s;pen&s;e for &s;ix months,
&s;he owned &s;he had been deceived; and General Stampa,
with the Imperial forces, took formal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
duchies of Parma and Placentia. Spain and the great Duke
of Tu&s;cany having acceded to the la&s;t treaty of Vienna,
the crown of Great-Britain engaged to equip an armament
that &s;hould convoy Don Carlos to his new dominions.
Accordingly, Sir Charles Wager &s;ailed with a &s;trong &s;qua|dron
from Port&s;mouth on the twenty-&s;ixth day of Augu&s;t;
and in September arrived at Barcelona, where being joined
by the Spani&s;h &s;leet and tran&s;ports, they &s;ailed together to
Leghorn; from whence the Admiral returned to England-Don
Carlos pa&s;&s;ed through part of France, and embarking
at Antibes on board of the Spani&s;h gallies, arrived at
Leghorn in December. Then the Imperial General with|drew
<PB N="460" REF="466">
his forces into the Milane&s;e; and the Infant took
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his new territories.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIX. During the&s;e tran&s;actions France was di&s;tracted
by religious di&s;putes, occa&s;ioned by the bull unigenitus
thundered again&s;t the doctrines of Jan&s;enius; a bull which
had produced a &s;chi&s;m in the Gallican church, and well
nigh involved that country in civil war and confu&s;ion. It
was oppo&s;ed by the parliaments and lay tribunals of the
kingdom; but many bi&s;hops, and the Je&s;uits in general,
were its mo&s;t &s;trenuous a&s;&s;erters. All the artifices of prie&s;t-craft
were practi&s;ed on both &s;ides, to inflame the enthu|&s;ia&s;m,
and manage the &s;uper&s;tition of the people. Pre|tended
miracles were wrought at the tomb of Abb&eacute;
Paris, who had died without accepting the bull, con&s;e|quently
was declared damned by the abettors of that con|&s;titution.
On the other hand, the Je&s;uits exerted all their
abilities and indu&s;try in preaching again&s;t the Jan&s;eni&s;ts;
in e&s;tabli&s;hing an opinion of their &s;uperior &s;anctity; and
in&s;piring a &s;pirit of quieti&s;m among their votaries, who
were tran&s;ported into the delirium of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, illumi|nation,
and &s;upernatural conver&s;e. The&s;e arts were often
u&s;ed for the mo&s;t infamous purpo&s;es. Female enthu&s;ia&s;ts
were wrought up to &s;uch a violence of agitations, that
nature fainted under the &s;truggle, and the p&s;eudo-&s;aint
&s;ei&s;ed this opportunity of violating the cha&s;tity of his
penitent. Such was &s;aid to be the ca&s;e of Mademoi&s;elle
la Cadiere, a young gentlewoman of Toulon, abu&s;ed in
this manner by the lu&s;t and villainy of Pere Girard, a noted
Je&s;uit, who underwent a trial before the parliament of Ai$,
and very narrowly e&s;caped the &s;take.</P>
<P>&sect; XXX. The parliament of Great-Britain meeting on
the thirteenth day of January, the King in his &s;peech de|clared,
that the general tranquillity of Europe was re&s;tored
and e&s;tabli&s;hed by the la&s;t treaty of Vienna: that Don
Carlos was actually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Parma and Placentia:
that &s;ix thou&s;and Spaniards were quietly admitted and
quartered in the duchy of Tu&s;cany, to &s;ecure, by the ex|pre&s;s
con&s;ent and agreement of the Great Duke, the
<PB N="461" REF="467">
rever&s;ion of his dominions; and that a family convention
was made between the courts of Spain and Tu&s;cany, for
pre&s;erving mutual peace and friend&s;hip in the two hou&s;es.
He told the Commons, that the e&s;timates for the &s;ervice of
the current year would be con&s;iderably le&s;s than tho&s;e of
former years. He recommended unanimity: he ob&s;erved
that this government had no &s;ecurity but what was equally
conducive to their happine&s;s, and to the protection of his
people: that their pro&s;perity had no foundation but in the
defence and &s;upport of his government. &startq;Our &s;afety,
(&s;aid he) is mutual, and our intere&s;ts are in&s;eparable.&endq;
The oppo&s;ition to the court mea&s;ures appears to have been
uncommonly &s;pirited during the cour&s;e of this &s;e&s;&s;ion.
The mini&s;ter's motions were attacked with all the artil|lery
of elocution. His principal emi&s;&s;aries were obliged
to ta&s;k their faculties to their full exertion, to puzzle
and perplex where they could not demon&s;trate and con|vice,
to mi&s;repre&s;ent what they could not vindicate,
and elude the arguments which they could not refute. In
the Hou&s;e of Commons Lord Hervey, lately appointed
vince-chamberlain of his Maje&s;ty's hou&s;ehold, made a
motion for an addre&s;s of thanks, in which they &s;hould
declare their entire approbation of the King's conduct,
acknowledge the ble&s;&s;ings they enjoyed under his govern|ment,
expre&s;s their confidence in the wi&s;dom of his coun|cils;
and declare their readine&s;s to grant the nece&s;&s;ary
&s;upplies. This member, &s;on to the Earl of Bri&s;tol, was
a nobleman of &s;ome parts, which, however, were more
&s;pecious than &s;olid. He conde&s;cended to act as a &s;ubaltern
to the mini&s;ter, and approved him&s;elf extremely active in
forwarding all his de&s;igns, whether as a &s;ecret emi&s;&s;ary
or publick orator; in which la&s;t capacity he appears to
have been pert, frivolous, and frothy. His motion was
&s;econded by Mr. Clutterbuck, and oppo&s;ed by Sir Wil|fred
Law&s;on, Mr. Shippen, Mr. W. Pulteney, Sir Wil|liam
Wyndham, and Mr. Oglethorpe. They did not argue
again&s;t a general addre&s;s of thanks; but expo&s;ed the ab|&s;urdity
and bad tendency of expre&s;&s;ions which implied a
<PB N="462" REF="468">
blind approbation of all the mea&s;ures of the mini&s;try. Sir
Wilfred Law&s;on ob&s;erved, that notwith&s;tanding the great
things we had done for the crown of Spain, and the favours
we had procured for the royal family of that kingdom,
little or no &s;atisfaction had as yet been received for the
injuries our merchants had &s;u&s;tained from that nation.
Mr. Pulteney took notice, that the nation, by becoming
guarantee to the pragmatick &s;anction, laid it&s;elf under an
obligation to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Au&s;trian family when attacked by
any potentate whatever, except the Grand Signior: that
they might be attacked when it would be much again&s;t the
intere&s;t of the kingdom to engage it&s;elf in a war upon
any foreign account: that it might one day be for the
intere&s;t of the nation to join again&s;t them, in order to pre|&s;erve
the balance of Europe, the e&s;tabli&s;hing of which
had already co&s;t England &s;uch immen&s;e &s;ums of money.
He in&s;i&s;ted upon the ab&s;urdity of concluding &s;uch a num|ber
of incon&s;i&s;tent treaties; and concluded with &s;aying,
that if affairs abroad were now happily e&s;tabli&s;hed, the
mini&s;try which conducted them might be compared to a
pilot, who, though there was a clear, &s;afe, and &s;traight
channel into port, yet took it in his head to carry the &s;hip
a great way about, through &s;ands, rocks, and &s;hallows;
who, after having lo&s;t a great number of &s;eamen, de&s;troyed
a great deal of tackle and rigging, and &s;ubjected the
owners to an enormous expen&s;e, at la&s;t by chance hits the
port, and triumphs in his good conduct. Sir William
Wyndham &s;poke to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. Mr. Oglethorpe, a
gentleman of unblemi&s;hed character, brave, generous, and
humane, affirmed that many other things related more
nearly to the honour and intere&s;t of the nation than did
the guarantee of the pragmatick &s;anction. He &s;aid he
wi&s;hed to have heard that the new works at Dunkirk had
been entirely ra&s;ed and de&s;troyed: that the nation had
received full and complete &s;atisfaction for the depredations
committed by the natives of Spain: that more care we
taken in di&s;ciplining the militia, on who&s;e valour th$
nation mu&s;t chiefly depend in ca&s;e of an inva&s;ion; and
<PB N="463" REF="469">
that &s;ome regard had been &s;hown to the oppre&s;&s;ed pro|te&s;tants
in Germany. He expre&s;&s;ed his &s;atisfaction to find
that the Engli&s;h were not &s;o clo&s;ely united to France as
formerly; for he had generally ob&s;erved, that when two
dogs were in a lea&s;h together, the &s;tronger generally ran
away with the weaker; and this, he was afraid, had been
the ca&s;e between France and Great-Britain. The motion
was vigorou&s;ly defended by Mr. Pelham, payma&s;ter of the
forces, and brother to the Duke of Newca&s;tle, a man
who&s;e greate&s;t fault was his being concerned in &s;upporting
the mea&s;ures of a corrupt mini&s;try. In other re&s;pects he
was liberal, candid, benevolent, and even attached to the
intere&s;t of his country, though egregiou&s;ly mi&s;taken in his
notions of government. On this occa&s;ion he a&s;&s;erted that
it was no way incon&s;i&s;tent with the honour or dignity of
that Hou&s;e to thank his Maje&s;ty in the mo&s;t particular
terms for every thing he had been plea&s;ed to communicate
in his &s;peech from the throne: that no expre&s;&s;ions of ap|probation
in the addre&s;s could be any way made u&s;e of to
prevent an enquiry into the mea&s;ures which had been pur|&s;ued,
when the treaties &s;hould be laid before the Hou&s;e.
He &s;aid, at the opening of a &s;e&s;&s;ion the eyes of all Europe
were turned towards Great-Britain, and from the par|liament's
fir&s;t re&s;olves all the neighbouring powers judged
of the unanimity that would en&s;ue between his Maje&s;ty
and the repre&s;entatives of his people: that their appearing
jealous or di&s;&s;ident of his Maje&s;ty's conduct would weaken
his influence upon the councils of foreign &s;tates and po|tentates,
and perhaps put it out of his power to rectify
any fal&s;e &s;tep that might have been made by his mini&s;ters.
His arguments were re-enforced by a long &s;peech from Mr.
H. Walpole. The que&s;tion was put, the motion carried,
and the addre&s;s pre&s;ented.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXI. The next &s;ubject of debate was the number
of land-forces. When the &s;upply &s;ell under con&s;ideration,
Sir W. Strickland, &s;ecretary at war, moved that the &s;ame
number which had been maintained in the preceding year
&s;hould be continued in pay. On the other hand, Lord
<PB N="464" REF="470">
Morpeth having demon&s;trated the danger to which the
liberties of the nation might be expo&s;ed, by maintaining a
numerous &s;tanding army in time of peace, made a motion
that the number &s;hould be reduced to twelve thou&s;and. A
warm di&s;pute en&s;uing, was managed in favour of the fir&s;t
motion by Lord Hervey, Sir Robert Walpole and his
brother, Mr. Pelham, and Sir Philip Yorke, attorney-general.
This gentleman was counted a better lawyer
than a politician, and &s;hone more as an advocate at the
bar than as an orator in the Hou&s;e of Commons. The
la&s;t parti&s;an of the mini&s;try was Sir William Yonge, one
of the lords commi&s;&s;ioners of the Trea&s;ury; a man who
rendered him&s;elf &s;erviceable and nece&s;&s;ary, by &s;tooping to
all compliances, running upon every &s;cent, and haranguing
on every &s;ubject with an even, uninterrupted, tedious &s;low
of dull declamation, compo&s;ed of a&s;&s;ertions without vera|city,
conclu&s;ions from fal&s;e premi&s;&s;es, words without mean|ing,
and language without propriety. Lord Morpeth's
motion was e&s;pou&s;ed by Mr. Watkin Williams Wynne, a
gentleman of an ancient family and opulent fortune in
Wales, brave, open, ho&s;pitable, and warmly attached to
the ancient con&s;titution and hierarchy: he was &s;upported
by Mr. Walter Plumer, who &s;poke with weight, preci&s;ion,
and &s;everity, by Sir, W. Wyndham, Mr. Shippen, Mr.
W. Pulteney, and Mr. Barnard. The courtiers argued
that it was nece&s;&s;ary to maintain &s;uch a number of land-forces
as might defeat the de&s;igns of malcontents, &s;ecure
the interior tranquillity of the kingdom, defend it from
external a&s;&s;aults, over-awe its neighbours, and enable it to
take vigorous mea&s;ures in ca&s;e the peace of Europe &s;hould
be re-embroiled. They affirmed the &s;cience of war was
&s;o much altered, and required &s;uch attention, that no de|pendence
was to be placed upon a militia: that all nations
were obliged to maintain &s;tanding armies, for their &s;ecurity
again&s;t the encroachments of neighbouring powers: that
the number of troops in Great-Britain was too incon|&s;iderable
to excite the jealou&s;y of the people, even under
an ambitious monarch: that his Maje&s;ty never entertained
<PB N="465" REF="471">
the lea&s;t thought of infringing the liberties of his &s;ubjects;
that it could not be &s;uppo&s;ed that the officers, among
whom were many gentlemen of family and fortune, would
ever concur in a de&s;ign to en&s;lave their country; and that
the forces now in pay could not be properly deemed a
&s;tanding army, ina&s;much as they were voted and main|tained
from year to year by the parliament, which was
the repre&s;entative of the people. To the&s;e arguments the
members in the oppo&s;ition replied, that a &s;tanding force
in time of peace was uncon&s;titutional, and had been always
thought dangerous; that a militia was as capable of di&s;ci|pline
as a &s;tanding army, and would have more incentives
to courage and per&s;everance; that the civil magi&s;trate was
able to pre&s;erve the peace of the country; that the number
of the malcontents was altogether contemptible, though it
might be con&s;iderably augmented by maintaining a &s;tand|ing
army, and other &s;uch arbitrary mea&s;ures; that other
nations had been en&s;laved by &s;tanding armies; and how|&s;oever
they might find them&s;elves nece&s;&s;itated to depend
upon a military force for &s;ecurity again&s;t encroaching
neighbours, the ca&s;e was very different with regard to
Great-Britain, for the defence of which nature had pro|vided
in a peculiar manner; that this provi&s;ion was
&s;trengthened and improved by a numerous navy, which
&s;ecured her the dominion of the &s;ea; and, if properly di&s;|po&s;ed,
would render all inva&s;ion impracticable, or at lea&s;t
ineffectual; that the land-army of Great-Britain, though
&s;ufficient to endanger the liberties of an unarmed people,
could not po&s;&s;ibly &s;ecure &s;uch an extent of coa&s;t, and
therefore could be of very little &s;ervice in preventing an
inva&s;ion; that though they had all imaginable confidence
in his Maje&s;ty's regard for the liberty of his &s;ubjects, they
could not help apprehending, that &s;hould a &s;tanding army
become part of the con&s;titution, another prince of more
dangerous talents, and more fatal de&s;igns, might ari&s;e, and
employ it for the wor&s;t purpo&s;es of ambition; that though
many officers were gentlemen of honour and probity, the&s;e
might be ea&s;ily di&s;earded, and the army gradually moulded
<PB N="466" REF="472">
into a quite different temper. By the&s;e means, practi&s;ed
in former times, an army had been new-modelled to &s;uch
a degree, that they turned their &s;words again&s;t the par|liament,
for who&s;e defence they had been rai&s;ed, and de|&s;troyed
the con&s;titution both in church and &s;tate: that with
re&s;pect to its being wholly dependant on the parliament,
the people of England would have rea&s;on to complain of
the &s;ame hard&s;hip, whether a &s;tanding army &s;hould be
declared at once indi&s;pen&s;able, or regularly voted from year
to year, according to the direction of the mini&s;try: that
the &s;anction of the legi&s;lature granted to mea&s;ures which
in them&s;elves are uncon&s;titutional, burthen&s;ome, odious,
and repugnant to the genius of the nation, in&s;tead of
yielding con&s;olation, would &s;erve only to demon&s;trate,
that the mo&s;t effectual method of forging the chains of
national &s;lavery would be that of mini&s;terial influence
operating upon a venal parliament. Such were the rea&s;ons
urged again&s;t a &s;tanding army, of what number &s;oever it
might be compo&s;ed: but the expediency of reducing the
number from about eighteen thou&s;and to twelve thou&s;and
was in&s;i&s;ted upon as the natural con&s;equences of his Ma|je&s;ty's
declaration, by which they were given to under|&s;tand
that the peace of Europe was e&s;tabli&s;hed; and that
he had nothing &s;o much at heart as the ca&s;e and pro&s;perity
of his people. It was &s;ugge&s;ted, that if eighteen thou&s;and
men were &s;ufficient on the &s;uppo&s;ed eve of a general war
in Europe, it was &s;urely rea&s;onable to think that a le&s;s
number would &s;uffice when peace was perfectly re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hed.
Whatever effect the&s;e rea&s;ons had upon the body
of the nation, they made no converts in the Hou&s;e, where
the majority re&s;olved that the &s;tanding army &s;hould be
maintained without reduction. Mr. Plumer complained
that the country was oppre&s;&s;ed by an arbitrary method of
quartering &s;oldiers, in an undue proportion, upon tho&s;e
publicans who refu&s;ed to vote in elections according to
the direction of the mini&s;try. Mr. Pulteney a&s;&s;erted that
the money rai&s;ed for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of eighteen thou&s;and
men in England would maintain &s;ixty thou&s;and French
<PB N="467" REF="473">
or Germans, or the &s;ame number of almo&s;t any other peo|ple
on the continent. Sir William Wyndham declared that
eighteen thou&s;and of the Engli&s;h troops in the late war
were maintained on le&s;s than two-thirds of the &s;um now
demanded for the like number; but no regard was paid to
the&s;e allegations.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXII. The next object of importance that attracted
the notice of the Hou&s;e was the &s;tate of the charitable
corporation. This company was fir&s;t erected in the year
one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;even. Their profe&s;&s;ed
intention was to lend money at legal intere&s;t to the poor,
upon &s;mall pledges; and to per&s;ons of better rank upon
an indubitable &s;ecurity of goods impawned. Their capital
was at fir&s;t limited to thirty thou&s;and pounds; but, by
licen&s;es from the crown, they increa&s;ed it to &s;ix hundred
thou&s;and pounds, though their charter was never con|firmed
by act of parliament. In the month of October,
George Robin&s;on, E&s;quire, member for Marlow, the
ca&s;hier, and John Thomp&s;on, warehou&s;e-keeper of the
corporation, di&s;appeared in one day. The proprietors,
alarmed at this incident, held &s;everal general courts, and
appointed a committee to in&s;pect the &s;tate of their affairs.
They reported, that for a capital of above five hundred
thou&s;and pounds no equivalent was found; ina&s;much as
their effects did not amount to the value of thirty thou&s;and,
the remainder having been embezzled by means which
they could not di&s;cover. The proprietors, in a petition
to the Hou&s;e of Commons, repre&s;ented that by the mo&s;t
notorious breach of tru&s;t in &s;everal per&s;ons to whom
the care and management of their affairs were committed,
the corporation had been defrauded of the greate&s;t part of
their capital; and that many of the petitioners were re|duced
to the utmo&s;t degree of mi&s;ery and di&s;tre&s;s: they,
therefore, prayed, that as they were unable to detect the
combinations of tho&s;e who had ruined them, or to bring the
delinquents to ju&s;tice, without the aid of the power and
authority of parliament, the Hou&s;e would vouch&s;afe to
enquire into the &s;tate of the corporation, and the conduct
<PB N="468" REF="474">
of their managers; and give &s;uch relief to the petitioners
as to the Hou&s;e &s;hould &s;eem meet. The petition was
graciou&s;ly received, and a &s;ecret committee appointed to
proceed on the enquiry. They &s;oon di&s;covered a mo&s;t
iniquitous &s;cene of fraud, which had been acted by Robin|&s;on
and Thomp&s;on, in concert with &s;ome of the directors,
for embezzling the capital, and cheating the proprietors.
Many per&s;ons of rank and quality were concerned in this
infamous con&s;piracy; &s;ome of the fir&s;t characters in the
nation did not e&s;cape &s;u&s;picion and cen&s;ure. Sir Robert
Sutton and Sir Archibald Grant were expelled the Hou&s;e
of Commons, as having had a con&s;iderable &s;hare in tho&s;e
fraudulent practices; a bill was brought in, to re&s;train
them and other delinquents from leaving the kingdom, or
alienating their effects. In the mean time, the committee
received a letter from Signor John Angelo Belloni, an
eminent banker at Rome, giving them to under&s;tand, that
Thomp&s;on was &s;ecured in that city, with all his papers,
and con&s;ined to the ca&s;tle of St. Angelo; and that the
papers were tran&s;mitted to his corre&s;pondent at Paris, who
would deliver them up, on certain conditions &s;tipulated in
favour of the pri&s;oner. This letter was con&s;idered as an
artifice to in&s;inuate a favourable opinion of the Pretender,
as if he had taken mea&s;ures for &s;ecuring Thomp&s;on, from
his zeal for ju&s;tice, and affection to the Engli&s;h people.
On this &s;uppo&s;ition, the propo&s;als were rejected with di&s;|dain;
and both Hou&s;es concurred in an order that the
letter &s;hould be burned at the Royal Exchange, by the
hands of the common hangman. The Lower Hou&s;e re|&s;olved
that it was an in&s;olent and audacious libel, ab&s;urd
and contradictory; that the whole tran&s;action was a &s;can|dalous
artifice, calculated to delude the unhappy, and to
di&s;gui&s;e and conceal the wicked practices of the pro&s;e&s;&s;ed
enemies to his Maje&s;ty's per&s;on, crown, and dignity.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIII. No motion, during this &s;e&s;&s;ion, produced
&s;uch a warm conte&s;t as did that of Sir Robert Walpole,
when, after a long preamble, he propo&s;ed that the duties
upon &s;alt, which about two years before had been aboli&s;hed,
<PB N="469" REF="475">
&s;hould now be revived, and granted to his Maje&s;ty,
his heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, for the term of three years. In
order to &s;weeten this propo&s;al, he declared that the land-tax
for the en&s;uing year &s;hould be reduced to one &s;hilling
in the pound. All the members of the country-party
were immediately in commotion. They expre&s;&s;ed their
&s;urpri&s;e at the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of the impo&s;ition. They ob&s;erved
that two years had &s;carce elap&s;ed &s;ince the King, in a
&s;peech from the throne, had exhorted them to aboli&s;h &s;ome
of the taxes that were the mo&s;t burthen&s;ome to the poor:
the Hou&s;e was then of opinion, that the tax upon &s;alt
was the mo&s;t burthen&s;ome, and the mo&s;t pernicious to the
trade of the kingdom, of all the impo&s;itions to which the
poor were &s;ubjected, and therefore it was taken off; but
that no good rea&s;on could be produced for altering their
opinion &s;o &s;uddenly, and re&s;olving to grind the faces of
the poor, in order to ca&s;e a few rich men of the landed in|tere&s;t.
They affirmed that the mo&s;t general taxes are not
always the lea&s;t burthen&s;ome; that after a nation is
obliged to extend their taxes farther than the luxuries of
their country, tho&s;e taxes that can be rai&s;ed with the lea&s;t
charge to the publick are the mo&s;t convenient and ea&s;ie&s;t
to the people; but they ought carefully to avoid taxing
tho&s;e things which are nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the
poor. The price of all nece&s;&s;aries being thus enhanced,
the wages of the trade&s;man and manufacturer mu&s;t be
increa&s;ed; and where the&s;e are high the manufactures
will be under&s;old by tho&s;e of cheaper countries. The
trade mu&s;t of con&s;equence be ruined; and it is not to be
&s;uppo&s;ed that the landed gentleman would choo&s;e to &s;ave a
&s;hilling in the pound from the land-tax, by means of an
expedient that would ruin the manufactures of his country,
and decrea&s;e the value of his own fortune. They alledged
that the &s;alt-tax particularly affected the poor, who could
not afford to eat fre&s;h provi&s;ions; and that, as it formerly
occa&s;ioned murmurs and di&s;contents among the lower
cla&s;s of people, the revival of it would, in all probability,
e$$&s;perate them into open &s;edition. They ob&s;erved, that
<PB N="470" REF="476">
while it was exacted in England a great number of mer|chants
&s;ent their &s;hips to Ireland, to be victualled for their
re&s;pective voyages: that, &s;ince it had been aboli&s;hed,
many experiments had been &s;ucce&s;sfully tried with &s;alt
for the improvement of agriculture, which would be en|tirely
defeated by the revival of this impo&s;ition. They
&s;ugge&s;ted that the land-tax was rai&s;ed at a very &s;mall ex|pen&s;e,
and &s;ubject to no fraud, whereas that upon &s;alt
would employ a great number of additional officers in the
revenue, wholly depending upon the mini&s;try, who&s;e in|fluence
in elections they would proportionably increa&s;e.
They even hinted, that this con&s;ideration was one power|ful
motive for propo&s;ing the revival of an odious tax,
which was in effect an exci&s;e, and would be deemed a
&s;tep towards a general exci&s;e upon all &s;orts of provi&s;ions.
Finally, they demon&s;trated that the &s;alt-tax introduced
numberle&s;s frauds and perjuries in different articles of
tra&s;&s;ick. Sir Robert Walpole endeavoured to obviate all
the&s;e objections in a long &s;peech, which was minutely
an&s;wered and refuted in every article by Mr. Pulteney.
Neverthele&s;s, the que&s;tion being put, the mini&s;ter's motion
was carried in the a&s;&s;irmative, and the duty revived: yet,
before the bill pa&s;&s;ed, divers motions were made, and ad|ditional
clau&s;es propo&s;ed by the members in the oppo&s;ition
New debates were rai&s;ed on every new objection, and the
courtiers were obliged to di&s;pute their ground by inches.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIV. The pen&s;ion bill was revived, and for the
third time rejected in the Hou&s;e of Lords. A bill for the
encouragement of the &s;ugar colonies pa&s;&s;ed through the
Lower Hou&s;e with great difficulty, but was lo&s;t among
the Peers: another, for the better &s;ecuring the freedom of
parliaments, by further qualifying members to &s;it in the
Hou&s;e of Commons, was read the third time, and thrown
out upon the que&s;tion. A committee had been appointed
to enquire into a &s;ale of the e&s;tate which had belonged to
the late Earl of Derwentwater. It appeared by the report,
that the &s;ale had been fraudulent: a bill was prepared to

commi&s;&s;ioners for the &s;ale of the forfeited e&s;tates, were
declared guilty of notorious breach of tru&s;t, and expelled
the Hou&s;e, of which they were members: George Robin|&s;on,
E&s;quire, underwent the &s;ame &s;entence, on account
of the part he acted in the charitable corporation, as he
and Thomp&s;on had neglected to &s;urrender them&s;elves,
according to the terms of a bill which had pa&s;&s;ed for that
purpo&s;e. During this &s;e&s;&s;ion, five members of parliament
were expelled for the mo&s;t &s;ordid acts of knavery: a &s;ure
&s;ign of national degeneracy and di&s;honour. All the &s;up|plies
were granted, and, among other articles, the &s;um of
two-and-twenty thou&s;and &s;ix hundred ninety-four pounds,
&s;even &s;hillings, and &s;ixpence for the agio or difference of
the &s;ub&s;idies payable to the crown of Denmark, in pur|&s;uance
of the treaty &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the late king and
that monarch: but this was not obtained without a violent
di&s;pute. Mr. Pulteney, who bore a con&s;iderable &s;hare in
all the&s;e debates, became in a little time &s;o remarkable as
to be thought worthy of a very particular mark of his
Maje&s;ty's di&s;plea&s;ure. The King, on the fir&s;t day of July,
called for the council-books, and with his own hand &s;truck
the name of William Pultency, E&s;quire, out of the li&s;t of
privy coun&s;ellors: his Maje&s;ty further ordered him to be
put out of all the commi&s;&s;ions of the peace. The &s;everal
lord-lieutenants from whom he had received deputations
were commanded to revoke them; and the Lord-Chan|cellor
and Secretaries of State were directed to give the
nece&s;&s;ary orders for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXV. Nor did the Hou&s;e of Peers tamely and
unanimou&s;ly &s;ubmit to the mea&s;ures of the mini&s;try. The
pen&s;ion-bill being read, was again rejected, and a prote&s;t
entered. A debate aro&s;e about the number of &s;tanding
&s;orces; and the Earl of Che&s;terfield argued for the court
motion. The Earl of Oxford moved, that they might be
reduced to twelve thou&s;and effective men. The Earl of
Winchel&s;ea ob&s;erved, that a &s;tanding army rendered mini|&s;ters
of &s;tate more daring than otherwi&s;e they would be,
in $word$ and $word$ projects that were grievous to
<PB N="472" REF="478">
the people: &s;chemes that never could enter into the heads
of any but tho&s;e who were drunk with exce&s;s of power.
The Marquis of Tweedale, in rea&s;oning again&s;t &s;uch a
number as the mini&s;try propo&s;ed, took occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve,
that not one &s;hilling of the forfeited e&s;tates was ever ap|plied
to the u&s;e of the publick: he likewi&s;e took notice,
that the eighteen thou&s;and men, demanded as a &s;tanding
force, were modelled in &s;uch a manner, that they might
be &s;peedily augmented to forty thou&s;and men on any
emergency. The Duke of Argyle endeavoured to demon|&s;trate
the danger of depending for the &s;afety of the king|dom
upon an undi&s;ciplined militia, a fleet, or an army of
auxillaries. Then he repre&s;ented the nece&s;&s;ity of having
recour&s;e to a regular army in ca&s;e of inva&s;ion; and after
all acknowledged that the number propo&s;ed was no way
&s;ufficient for that purpo&s;e. All his arguments were an|&s;wered
and refuted in an excellent &s;peech by Lord Car|teret:
neverthele&s;s, victory declared for the mini&s;ter. The
parliament having granted every branch of the &s;upply, to|wards
the payment of which they borrowed a &s;um from
the &s;inking fund, and pa&s;&s;ed divers other acts for the en|couragement
of commerce and agriculture, the King, on
the fir&s;t day of June,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1732.</NOTE> gave the royal a&s;&s;ent to the bills that
were prepared, and clo&s;ed the &s;e&s;&s;ion, after having in|formed
both Hou&s;es that the States-General had acceded
to the treaty of Vienna: that he had determined to vi&s;it
his German dominions, and to leave the Queen regent in
his ab&s;ence. He accordingly &s;et out for Hanover in the
beginning of June. By this time the pragmatick &s;anction
was confirmed by the diet of the empire, though not with|out
a formal prote&s;t by the Electors Palatine, Bavaria, and
Saxony.</P>

<P>&sect; I.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1732.</NOTE> THE mo&s;t remarkable incident that di&s;tingui&s;h|ed
this year in England was a very uncommon
in&s;tance of &s;uicide; an act of de&s;pair &s;o frequent among
the Engli&s;h, that in other countries it is objected to them
as a national reproach. Though it may be generally
termed the effect of lunacy proceeding from natural cau&s;es
operating on the human body, in &s;ome few in&s;tances it
&s;eems to have been the re&s;ult of cool deliberation. Rich|ard
Smith, a bookbinder, and pri&s;oner for debt within the
liberties of the King's-Bench, per&s;uaded his wife to follow
his example in making away with her&s;elf, after they had
murthered their little infant. This wretched pair were in
the month of April found hanging in their bed-chamber,
at about a yard's di&s;tance from each other; and in a
&s;eparate apartment the child lay dead in a cradle. They
left two papers enclo&s;ed in a &s;hort letter to their landlord,
who&s;e kindne&s;s they implored in favour of their dog and
cat. They even left money to pay the porter who &s;hould
carry the enclo&s;ed papers to the per&s;on for whom they
were addre&s;&s;ed. In one of the&s;e the hu&s;band thanked that
per&s;on for the marks of friend&s;hip he had received at his
hands; and complained of the ill offices he had undergone
from a different quarter. The other paper, &s;ub&s;cribed by
the hu&s;band and wife, contained the rea&s;ons which in|duced
them to act &s;uch a tragedy on them&s;elves and their
offspring. This letter was altogether &s;urpri&s;ing for the
$word$ re&s;olution, the good humour, and the propriety with
which it was written. They declared, that they with|drew
them&s;elves from poverty and rags; evils $word$
<PB N="475" REF="481">
through a train of unlucky accidents,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. V. 1732.</NOTE> were become in|evitable.
They appealed to their neighbours for the in|du&s;try
with which they had endeavoured to earn a liveli|hood.
They ju&s;tified the murther of their child, by &s;aying
it was le&s;s cruelty to take her with them, than to leave
her friendle&s;s in the world, expo&s;ed to ignorance and
mi&s;ery. They profe&s;&s;ed their belief and confidence in an
Almighty God, the fountain of goodne&s;s and beneficence,
who could not po&s;&s;ibly take delight in the mi&s;ery of his
creatures: they, therefore, re&s;igned up their lives to him
without any terrible apprehen&s;ions; &s;ubmitting them&s;elves
to tho&s;e ways which, in his goodne&s;s, he &s;hould appoint
after death. Tho&s;e unfortunate &s;uicides had been always
indu&s;trious and frugal, invincibly hone&s;t, and remarkable
for conjugal affection.</P>
<P>&sect; II. Tru&s;tees having been appointed by charter to
&s;uperintend a new &s;ettlement in Georgia, &s;ituated to the
&s;outhward of Carolina in America, Mr. Oglethorpe, as
general, and governor of the province, embarked at Grave&s;|end,
with a number of poor families, to plant that colony.
The King of Spain having equipped a very powerful arma|ment,
the fleet &s;ailed on the fourth day of June from the
road of Alicant, under the command of the Count de
Montemar, and arrived on the coa&s;t of Barbary in the
neighbourhood of Oran, where a con&s;iderable body of
troops was landed without much oppo&s;ition. Next day,
however, they were attacked by a numerous army of
Moors, over whom they obtained a complete victory.
The Bey or governor of Oran immediately retired with
his garri&s;on, and the Spaniards took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the place,
from which they had been driven in the year one thou&s;and
&s;even hundred and eight. The &s;trong &s;ort of Mazalaquivir
was likewi&s;e &s;urrendered to the victors at the fir&s;t &s;ummons;
&s;o that this expedition an&s;wered all the views with which
it had been projected. Victor Amadaeus, the abdicated
King of Sardinia, having, at the in&s;tigation of his wife,
engaged in &s;ome intrigues, in order to re-a&s;cend the throne,
his &s;on, the reigning king, ordered his per&s;on to be &s;ei&s;ed
at Montealier, and conveyed to Rivoli, under a &s;trong
<PB N="476" REF="482">
e&s;cort. His wife, the Marchione&s;s de Spigno, was con|ducted
to Seva. The old King's confe&s;&s;or, his phy&s;ician,
and eight-and-forty per&s;ons of di&s;tinction were impri&s;oned.
The citadel of Turin was &s;ecured with a &s;tronger garri&s;on;
and new in&s;tructions were given to the governor and &s;enate
of Chamberri. The di&s;pute which had long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted be|tween
the King of Pru&s;&s;ia and the young Prince of Orange,
touching the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the e&s;tates po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by King Wil|liam
III. as head of the hou&s;e of Orange, was at la&s;t accom|modated
by a formal treaty &s;igned at Berlin and Dieren.
The Dutch were greatly alarmed about this time with an
apprehen&s;ion of being overwhelmed by an inundation, oc|ca&s;ioned
by worms, which were &s;aid to have con&s;umed the
piles and timber-work that &s;upported their dykes. They
prayed and fa&s;ted with uncommon zeal, in terrour of this
calamity, which they did not know how to avert in any
other manner. At length, they were delivered from their
fears by a hard fro&s;t, which effectually de&s;troyed tho&s;e dan|gerous
animals. About this time, Mr. Dieded, plenipoten|tiary
from the Elector of Hanover, received, in the name
of his ma&s;ter, the inve&s;titure of Bremen and Verden from
the hands of the Emperor.</P>
<P>&sect; III. The hi&s;tory of England at this period cannot be
very intere&s;ting, as it chiefly con&s;i&s;ts in an annual revo|lution
of debates in parliament. Debates, in which the
&s;ame arguments perpetually recur on the &s;ame &s;ubjects.
When the &s;e&s;&s;ion was opened on the &s;ixteenth day of Janu|ary,
the King declared, that the &s;ituation of affairs both
at home and abroad rendered it unnece&s;&s;ary for him to lay
before the two Hou&s;es any other rea&s;ons for calling them
together, but the ordinary di&s;patch of the public bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
and his de&s;ire of receiving their advice in &s;uch affairs
as &s;hould require the care and con&s;ideration of parliament.
The motion made in the Hou&s;e of Commons for an addre&s;s
of thanks implied, that they &s;hould expre&s;s their &s;atisfaction
at the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of affairs both at home and abroad.
The motion was carried, notwith&s;tanding the oppo&s;ition
of tho&s;e who ob&s;erved, that the nation had very little rea|&s;on
to be plea&s;ed with the pre&s;ent po&s;ture of affairs; that
<PB N="477" REF="483">
the French were employed in fortifying and re&s;toring the
harbour of Dunkirk, contrary to the faith of the mo&s;t &s;o|lemn
treaties; that the Briti&s;h merchants had received no
redre&s;s for the depredations committed by the Spaniards;
that the commerce of England daily decrea&s;ed; that no
&s;ort of trade throve but the traffick of Change-Alley, where
the mo&s;t abominable frauds were practi&s;ed; and that every
&s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament opened a new &s;cene of villainy and
impo&s;ition.</P>
<P>&sect; IV. The pen&s;ion bill was once more revived, and
lo&s;t again in the Hou&s;e of Peers. All the rea&s;ons former|ly
advanced again&s;t a &s;tanding army were now repeated;
and a reduction of the number in&s;i&s;ted upon with &s;uch
warmth, that the mini&s;terial party were obliged to have
recour&s;e to the old phantom of the Pretender. Sir Archer
Croft &s;aid a continuation of the &s;ame number of forces
was the more nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e, to his knowledge, popery
was increa&s;ing very fa&s;t in the country; for, in one pari&s;h
which he knew, there were &s;even popi&s;h prie&s;ts; and
that the danger from the Pretender was the more to be
feared, becau&s;e they did not know but he was then breed|ing
his &s;on a prote&s;tant. Sir Robert Walpole ob&s;erved,
that a reduction of the army was the chief thing wi&s;hed
for and de&s;ired by all the Jacobites in the kingdom; that
no reduction had ever been made but what gave fre&s;h
hopes to that party, and encouraged them to rai&s;e tumults
again&s;t the government; and he did not doubt but that
if they &s;hould re&s;olve to reduce any part of the army, there
would be po&s;t-hor&s;es employed that very night to carry
the good news beyond &s;ea to the Pretender. His brother
Horatio added that the number of troops then propo&s;ed
was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport his Maje&s;ty's govern|ment,
and would be nece&s;&s;ary as long as the nation en|joyed
the happine&s;s of having the pre&s;ent illu&s;trious family
on the throne. The &s;utility, the &s;elf-contradiction, and
the ridiculous ab&s;urdity of the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions were properly
expo&s;ed; neverthele&s;s, the army was voted without any
reduction. Sir Wilfred Law&s;on having made a motion
<PB N="478" REF="484">
for an addre&s;s to the King, to know what &s;atisfaction had
been made by Spain for the depredations committed on the
Briti&s;h merchants, it was after a violent debate approved,
and the addre&s;s pre&s;ented. The King, in an&s;wer to this
remon&s;trance, gave them to under&s;tand, that the meeting
of the commi&s;&s;aries of the two crowns had been &s;o long de|layed
by unfore&s;een accidents; that the conferences were not
opened till the latter end of the preceding February; and
that as the courts of London and Madrid had agreed that
the term of three years &s;tipulated for fini&s;hing the commi&s;|&s;ion
&s;hould be computed from their fir&s;t meeting, a perfect
account of their proceedings could not as yet be laid before
the Hou&s;e of Commons. A bill had been long depending
for granting encouragement to the &s;ugar colonies in the
We&s;t-Indies; but, as it was founded upon a prohibition
that would have put a &s;top to all commerce between the
French i&s;lands and the Briti&s;h &s;ettlements in North-Ame|rica,
it met with a very warm oppo&s;ition from tho&s;e who
had the pro&s;perity of tho&s;e northern colonies at heart. But
the bill being patroni&s;ed and &s;upported by court intere&s;t,
&s;urmounted all objections; and afterwards pa&s;&s;ed into a
law. While the Commons deliberated upon the &s;upply,
Sir Robert Walpole moved, that five hundred thou&s;and
pounds &s;hould be i&s;&s;ued out of the &s;inking fund for the &s;er|vice
of the en&s;uing year. Sir William Wyndham, Mr.
Pulteney, and Sir John Barnard, expatiated upon the ini|quity
of pillaging a &s;acred depo&s;it, &s;olemnly appropriated
to the di&s;charge of the national debt. They might have
demon&s;trated the egregious &s;olly of a mea&s;ure, by which
the publick, for a little temporary ea&s;e, lo&s;t the advantage
of the accumulating intere&s;t which would have ari&s;en from
the &s;inking fund if properly managed and re&s;erved. All
objections vani&s;hed before the powers of mini&s;terial influ|ence,
which nothing now could check but the immediate
danger of popular commotion. Such hazardous interpo&s;i|tion
actually defeated a &s;cheme which had been adopted
by the mini&s;ter, and even before its appearance alarmed
all the trading part of the nation.</P>
<P><PB N="479" REF="485">
&sect; V. The Hou&s;e having re&s;olved it&s;elf into a committee,
to deliberate upon the mo&s;t proper methods for the better
&s;ecurity and improvement of the duties and revenues
charged upon tobacco and wines, all the papers relating
to the&s;e duties were &s;ubmitted to the peru&s;al of the mem|bers:
the commi&s;&s;ioners of the Cu&s;toms and Exci&s;e were
ordered to attend the Hou&s;e, the avenues of which were
crowded with multitudes of people; and the members in
the oppo&s;ition waited impatiently for a propo&s;al, in which
they thought the liberties of their country &s;o deeply in|tere&s;ted.
In a word, there had been a call of the Hou&s;e
on the preceding day. The &s;e&s;&s;ion was frequent and
full; and both &s;ides appeared ready and eager for the
conte&s;t, when Sir Robert Walpole broached his de&s;ign.
He took notice of the arts which had been u&s;ed to pre|judice
the people again&s;t his plan before it was known.
He affirmed that the clamours occa&s;ioned by the&s;e preju|dices
had originally ri&s;en from &s;mugglers and fraudulent
dealers, who had enriched them&s;elves by cheating the
publick; and that the&s;e had been &s;trenuou&s;ly a&s;&s;i&s;ted and
&s;upported by another &s;et of men, fond of every opportunity
to &s;tir up the people of Great-Britain to mutiny and &s;e|dition.
He expatiated on the frauds that were committed
in that branch of the revenue ari&s;ing from the duties on
tobacco; upon the hard&s;hips to which the American
planters were &s;ubjected by the heavy duties payable on
importation as well as by the ill u&s;age they had met with
from their factors and corre&s;pondents in England, who,
from being their &s;ervants, were now become their ma&s;ters;
upon the injury done to the fair trader; and the lo&s;s
&s;u&s;tained by the publick with re&s;pect to the revenue. He
a&s;&s;erted that the &s;cheme he was about to propo&s;e would
remove all the&s;e inconveniencies, prevent numberle&s;s frauds,
perjuries, and fal&s;e entries, and add two or three hundred
thou&s;and pounds per annum to the publick revenue. He
entered into a long detail of frauds practi&s;ed by the knavi&s;h
dealer in tho&s;e commodities: he recited the &s;everal acts
of parliament that related to the duties on wine and
<PB N="480" REF="486">
tobacco: he declared he had no intention to promote a
general exci&s;e: he endeavoured to obviate &s;ome objections
that might be made to his plan, the nature of which he
at length explained. He propo&s;ed to join the laws of Ex|ci&s;e
to tho&s;e of the Cu&s;toms: that the further &s;ub&s;idy of
three farthings per pound charged upon imported tobacco
&s;hould be &s;till levied at the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e, and payable
to his Maje&s;ty's civil-li&s;t as heretofore; that then the
tobacco &s;hould be lodged in warehou&s;es, to be appointed
for that purpo&s;e by the commi&s;&s;ioners of the Exci&s;e; that
the keeper of each warehou&s;e, appointed likewi&s;e by the
commi&s;&s;ioners, &s;hould have one lock and key, and the
merchant-importer have another; and that the tobacco
&s;hould be thus &s;ecured until the merchant &s;hould find vent
for it, either by exportation or home con&s;umption; that
the part de&s;igned for exportation &s;hould be weighed at the
Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e, di&s;charged of the three farthings per pound
which had been paid at its fir&s;t importation, and then
exported without further trouble; that the portion de&s;tined
for home con&s;umption &s;hould, in pre&s;ence of the ware|hou&s;e-keeper,
be delivered to the purcha&s;er, upon his pay|ing
the inland duty of four pence per pound weight to
the proper officers appointed to receive it; by which means
the merchant would be ca&s;ed of the inconvenience of pay|ing
the duty upon importation, or of granting bonds and
finding &s;ureties for the payment, before he had found a
market for the commodity; that all penalties and for|feitures,
&s;o far as they formerly belonged to the crown,
&s;hould for the future be applied to the u&s;e of the publick;
that appeals in this, as well as in all other ca&s;es relating to
the exci&s;e, &s;hould be heard and determined by two or three
of the judges, to be named by his Maje&s;ty; and in the
country, by the judge of a&s;&s;i&s;e upon the next circuit,
who &s;hould hear and determine &s;uch appeals in the mo&s;t
&s;ummary manner, without the formality of proceedings in
courts of law or equity.</P>
<P>&sect; VI. Such was the &s;ub&s;tance of the famous exci&s;e
&s;cheme, in favour of which Sir Robert Walpole moved,
<PB N="481" REF="487">
that the duties and &s;ub&s;idies on tobacco &s;hould from and
after the twenty-fourth day of June cea&s;e and determine.
The debate which en&s;ued was managed and maintained by
all the able &s;peakers on both &s;ides of the que&s;tion. Sir
Robert Walpole was an&s;wered by Mr. Perry, member for
the city of London. Sir Paul Methuen joined in the op|po&s;ition.
Sir John Barnard, another repre&s;entative of
London, di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the &s;ame cau&s;e. He was
&s;upported by Mr. Pulteney, Sir William Wyndham, and
other patriots. The &s;cheme was e&s;pou&s;ed by Sir Philip
Yorke, appointed lord-chief-ju&s;tice of the King's-Bench,
and ennobled in the cour&s;e of the en&s;uing year. Sir
Jo&s;eph Jekyl approved of the project, which was likewi&s;e
&s;trenuou&s;ly defended by Lord Hervey, Sir Thomas Robin|&s;on,
Sir William Yonge, Mr. Pelham, and Mr. Winning|ton,
which la&s;t excelled all his contemporaries of the mini|&s;try
in talents and addre&s;s. Tho&s;e who argued again&s;t the
&s;cheme accu&s;ed the mini&s;ter of having mi&s;repre&s;ented
the frauds, and made fal&s;e calculations. With re&s;pect to
the &s;uppo&s;ed hard&s;hips under which the planters were &s;aid
to labour, they affirmed that no planter had ever dreamed
of complaining, until in&s;tigated by letters and applications
from London: that this &s;cheme, far from relieving the
planters, would expo&s;e the factors to &s;uch grievous op|pre&s;&s;ion,
that they would not be able to continue the
trade, con&s;equently the planters would be entirely ruined;
and after all it would not prevent tho&s;e frauds again&s;t
which it was &s;aid to be provided: that from the examina|tion
of the commi&s;&s;ioners of the Cu&s;toms, it appeared
that tho&s;e frauds did not exceed forty thou&s;and pounds
per annum, and might in a great mea&s;ure be aboli&s;hed, by
a due execution of the laws in being; con&s;equently this
&s;cheme was unnece&s;&s;ary, would ineffectual in augment|ing
the revenue, de&s;tructive to trade, and dangerous to
the liberties of the &s;ubject, as it tended to promote a
general exci&s;e, which was in all countries con&s;idered as a
grievous oppre&s;&s;ion. They &s;ugge&s;ted that it would pro|duce
an additional &s;warm of exci&s;e-officers and warehou&s;e-keepers,
<PB N="482" REF="488">
appointed and paid by the Trea&s;ury, &s;o as to
multiply the dependents on the crown, and enable it &s;till
further to influence the freedom of elections: that the
traders would become &s;laves to exci&s;emen and ware|hou&s;e-keepers,
as they would be debarred all acce&s;s to
their commodities, except at certain hours, when attended
by tho&s;e officers: that the merchant, for every quantity of
tobacco he could fell, would be obliged to make a journey,
or &s;end a me&s;&s;enger to the office for a permit, which could
not be obtained without trouble, expen&s;e, and delay: and
that &s;hould a law be enacted in con&s;equence of this mo|tion,
it would in all probability be &s;ome time or other u&s;ed
as a precedent for introducing exci&s;e laws into every
branch of the revenue; in which ca&s;e the liberty of Great-Britain
would be no more. In the cour&s;e of this debate,
Sir Robert Walpole took notice of the multitudes which
had be&s;et all the approaches to the Hou&s;e. He &s;aid it
would be an ea&s;y ta&s;k for a de&s;igning &s;editious per&s;on to
rai&s;e a tumult and di&s;order among them: that gentlemen
might give them what name they &s;hould think &s;it, and
affirm they were come as humble &s;uppliants; but he knew
whom the law called &s;turdy beggars; and tho&s;e who
brought them to that place could not be certain but that
they might behave in the &s;ame manner. This in&s;inuation
was re&s;ented by Sir John Barnard, who ob&s;erved that mer|chants
of character had a right to come down to the
Court of Reque&s;ts, and lobby of the Hou&s;e of Commons,
in order to &s;ollicit their friends and acquaintance again&s;t
any &s;cheme or project which they might think prejudicial
to their commerce: that when he came into the Hou&s;e,
he &s;aw none but &s;uch as de&s;erved the appellation of &s;turdy
beggars as little as the honourable gentleman him&s;elf, or
any gentleman whatever.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1733.</NOTE> After a warm di&s;pute the mo|tion
was carried by a majority of &s;ixty-one voices. Several
re&s;olutions were &s;ounded on the propo&s;al; and to the&s;e the
Hou&s;e agreed, though not without another violent conte&s;t.
The re&s;olutions produced a bill, again&s;t which petitions
were preferred by the lord-mayor, aldermen, and
<PB N="483" REF="489">
common council of London, the cities of Coventry and Not|tingham.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. V. 1733.</NOTE>
A motion was made that coun&s;el &s;hould be heard
for the city of London; but it was rejected by the ma|jority,
and the petitions were ordered to lie upon the table.
Had the mini&s;ter encountered no oppo&s;ition but that which
appeared within doors, his project would have certainly
been carried into execution: but the whole nation was
alarmed, and clamoured loudly again&s;t the exci&s;e-bill.
The populace &s;till crowded around We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall,
blocking up all the avenues to the Hou&s;e of Commons.
They even in&s;ulted the per&s;ons of tho&s;e members who had
voted for the mini&s;try on this occa&s;ion; and Sir Robert
Walpole began to be in fear of his life. He, therefore,
thought proper to drop the de&s;ign, by moving that the
&s;econd reading of the bill might be po&s;tponed till the
twelfth day of June. Then complaint being made of the
in&s;olence of the populace, who had maltreated &s;everal
members, divers re&s;olutions were taken again&s;t tho&s;e tu|multuous
crowds, and their abettors: the&s;e re&s;olves were
communicated to the lord-mayor of London, the &s;heriff of
Middle&s;ex, and the high-bailiff of We&s;tmin&s;ter. Some
individuals were apprehended in the Court of Reque&s;ts, as
having fomented the di&s;turbances; but they were &s;oon
relea&s;ed. The mi&s;carriage of the bill was celebrated with
publick rejoicings in London and We&s;tmin&s;ter; and the
mini&s;ter was burned in effigy by the populace. After the
mi&s;carriage of the exci&s;e-&s;cheme, the Hou&s;e unanimou&s;ly
re&s;olved to enquire into the frauds and abu&s;es in the Cu&s;|toms;
and a committee of twenty-one per&s;ons was cho&s;en
by ballot for this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>&sect; VII. The &s;ub&s;equent debates of this &s;e&s;&s;ion were oc|ca&s;ioned
by a bill to prevent the infamous practice of &s;tock-jobbing,
which with great difficulty made its way to the
Hou&s;e of Lords, who propo&s;ed &s;ome amendments, in
con&s;equence of which it was laid a&s;ide; and by another
bill e&s;tabli&s;hing a lottery, to rai&s;e five hundred thou&s;and
pounds for the relief of tho&s;e who had &s;uffered by the cha|ritable
corporation. After having undergone &s;ome alter|ations
<PB N="484" REF="490">
it pa&s;&s;ed through both Hou&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK. II. 1733.</NOTE> and obtained the
royal a&s;&s;ent. The King, by a me&s;&s;age to parliament, had
&s;ignified his intention to give the Prince&s;s Royal in mar|riage
to the Prince of Orange, promi&s;ing him&s;elf their con|currence
and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, that he might be enabled to be&s;tow
&s;uch a portion with his elde&s;t daughter as &s;hould be &s;uitable
to the occa&s;ion. The Commons immediately re&s;olved,
that out of the monies ari&s;ing from the &s;ale of lands in the
i&s;land of St. Chri&s;topher's his Maje&s;ty &s;hould be empower|ed
to apply four&s;core thou&s;and pounds, as a marriage dower
for his daughter; and a clau&s;e for this purpo&s;e was in&s;erted
in the bill, for enabling his Maje&s;ty to apply five hundred
thou&s;and pounds out of the &s;inking fund for the &s;ervice of
the current year.</P>
<P>&sect; VIII. The oppo&s;ition in the Hou&s;e of Lords was &s;till
more animated, though ineffectual. The debates chiefly
turned upon the pen&s;ion-bill, the number of land forces,
and a motion made by Lord Bathur&s;t, for an account
of the produce of the forfeited e&s;tates which had
belonged to the directors of the South-Sea company.
The tru&s;tees for the&s;e e&s;tates had charged them&s;elves with
a great &s;um of money, and the lords in the oppo&s;ition
thought they had a right to know how it had been di&s;|po&s;ed.
The mini&s;try had rea&s;ons to &s;ti&s;le this enquiry;
and, therefore, oppo&s;ed it with all their vigour. Never|thele&s;s,
the motion was carried, after a warm di&s;pute, and
the directors of the South-Sea company were ordered to
lay the account before the Hou&s;e. From this, it appeared
that the large &s;ums of money ari&s;ing from the forfeited
e&s;tates had been di&s;tributed among the proprietors, by way
of dividend, even before recour&s;e was had to parliament
for directions in what manner that produce &s;hould be ap|plied:
Lord Bathur&s;t, therefore, moved for a re&s;olution of
the Hou&s;e, that the di&s;po&s;al of this money by way of dividend,
without any order or direction of a general court for that
purpo&s;e, was a violation of the act of parliament made for
the di&s;po&s;al thereof, and a manife&s;t inju&s;tice done to the
proprietors of that &s;tock. The Duke of Newca&s;tle, in
<PB N="485" REF="491">
order to gain time, moved, that as the account was con|fu&s;ed,
and almo&s;t unintelligible, the pre&s;ent directors of
the company might be ordered to lay before the Hou&s;e a
further and more di&s;tinct account of the manner in which
the money had been di&s;po&s;ed. A violent conte&s;t en&s;ued,
in the cour&s;e of which the Hou&s;e divided, and of fifty-&s;even
peers who voted for the delay, forty-&s;ix were &s;uch as en|joyed
preferment in the church, commi&s;&s;ions in the army,
or civil employments under the government. At length
Lord Bathur&s;t waved his motion for that time: then the
Hou&s;e ordered that the pre&s;ent and former directors of the
South-Sea company, together with the late in&s;pectors of
their accounts, &s;hould attend, and be examined. They
were accordingly interrogated, and gave &s;o little &s;atis|faction,
that Lord Bathur&s;t moved for a committee of en|quiry;
but the que&s;tion being put, was carried in the
negative: yet a very &s;trong prote&s;t was entered by the
lords in the oppo&s;ition. The next &s;ubject of altercation
was the bill for mi&s;applying part of the produce of the
&s;inking-fund. It was attacked with all the force of argu|ment,
wit, and declamation by the Earl of Stafford, Lords
Bathur&s;t and Carteret, and particularly by the Earl of Che|&s;terfield,
who had by this time re&s;igned his &s;taff of lord-&s;tew|ard
of the hou&s;ehold, and renounced all connexion with the
mini&s;try. Lord Bathur&s;t moved for a re&s;olution, importing
that, in the opinion of the Hou&s;e, the &s;inking-fund ought
for the future to be applied, in time of peace and publick
tranquillity, to the redemption of tho&s;e taxes which were
mo&s;t prejudicial to the trade, mo&s;t burthen&s;ome on the
manufactures, and mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive on the poor of the
nation. This motion was over-ruled, and the bill adopted
by the majority. On the eleventh day of June, the King
gave the royal a&s;&s;ent to the bills that were prepared, and
clo&s;ed the &s;e&s;&s;ion with a &s;peech, in which he took notice
of the wicked endeavours that had been lately u&s;ed to in|flame
the minds of the people, by the mo&s;t unju&s;t mi&s;repre|&s;entations.</P>
<P><PB N="486" REF="492">
&sect; IX. Europe was now re-involved in fre&s;h troubles, by
a vacancy on the throne of Poland. Augu&s;tus died at
War&s;aw in the end of January, and the neighbouring
powers were immediately in commotion. The Elector of
Saxony, &s;on to the late king, and Stani&s;laus, who&s;e daugh|ter
was married to the French monarch, declared them|&s;elves
candidates for the Poli&s;h throne. The Emperor,
the Czarina, and the King of Pru&s;&s;ia e&s;pou&s;ed the intere&s;ts
of the Saxon: the King of France &s;upported the preten|&s;ions
of his father-in-law. The foreign mini&s;ters at War|&s;aw
forthwith began to form intrigues among the Electors;
the Marquis de Monti, amba&s;&s;adour from France, exerted
him&s;elf &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully, that he &s;oon gained over the pri|mate,
and a majority of the Catholick dietines, to the
intere&s;ts of Stani&s;laus; while the Imperial and Ru&s;&s;ian
troops hovered on the frontiers of Poland. The French
King no &s;ooner under&s;tood that a body of the Emperor's
forces was encamped in Sile&s;ia, than he ordered the Duke
of Berwick to a&s;&s;emble an army on the Rhine, and take
mea&s;ures for entering Germany, in ca&s;e the Imperiali$$$
&s;hould march into Poland. A French fleet &s;et &s;ail for
Dantzick, while Stani&s;laus travelled through Germany in
di&s;gui&s;e to Poland, and concealed him&s;elf in the hou&s;e of
the French amba&s;&s;adour at War&s;aw. As the day of election
approached, the Imperial, Ru&s;&s;ian, and Pru&s;&s;ian mini|&s;ters
delivered in their &s;everal declarations, by way of
prote&s;t again&s;t the contingent election of Stani&s;laus, as a
per&s;on pro&s;cribed, di&s;qualified, depending upon a foreign
power, and connected with the Turks, and other infidels.
The Ru&s;&s;ian General La&s;ci entered Poland at the head of
fifty thou&s;and men: the diet of the election was opened
with the u&s;ual ceremony on the twenty-fifth day of Augu&s;t.
Prince Vie&s;azowi&s;ki, chief of the Saxon intere&s;t, retired
to the other &s;ide of the Vi&s;tula, with three thou&s;and men&punc;
including &s;ome of the nobility who adhered to that party.
Neverthele&s;s, the primate proceeded to the election: Stani&s;|laus
was unanimou&s;ly cho&s;en king; and appeared in the
electoral field, where he was received with loud accla|mation.
<PB N="487" REF="493">
The oppo&s;ite party &s;oon increa&s;ed to ten thou|&s;and
men; prote&s;ted again&s;t the election, and joined the
Ru&s;&s;ian army, which advanced by &s;peedy marches. King
Stani&s;laus finding him&s;elf unable to cope with &s;uch adver|&s;aries,
retired with the primate and French amba&s;&s;adour to
Dantzick, leaving the Palatine of Kiow at War&s;aw.
This general attacked the Saxon palace, which was &s;ur|rendered
upon terms: then the &s;oldiers and inhabitants plun|dered
the hou&s;es belonging to the grandees who had declar|ed
for Augu&s;tus, as well as the hotel of the Ru&s;&s;ian mini&s;ter.
In the mean time, the Poles, who had joined the Mu&s;co|vites,
finding it impracticable to pa&s;s the Vi&s;tula before
the expiration of the time fixed for the &s;e&s;&s;ion of the diet,
erected a kolo at Grocow, where the Elector of Saxony
was cho&s;en and proclaimed, by the Bi&s;hop of Cracow,
King of Poland, under the name of Augu&s;tus III. on the
&s;ixth day of October. They afterwards pa&s;&s;ed the river,
and the Palatine of Kiow retiring towards Cracow, they
took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of War&s;aw, where in their turn they plun|dered
the palaces and hou&s;es belonging to the oppo&s;ite
party.</P>
<P>&sect; X. During the&s;e tran&s;actions, the French King con|cluded
a treaty with Spain and Sardinia, by which tho&s;e
powers agreed to declare war again&s;t the Emperor. Mani|fe&s;tos
were publi&s;hed reciprocally by all the contracting
powers. The Duke of Berwick pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine in
October, and undertook the &s;iege of fort Kehl, which in
a few days was &s;urrendered on capitulation; then he re|pa&s;&s;ed
the river, and returned to Ver&s;ailles. The King
of Sardinia having declared war again&s;t the Emperor,
joined a body of French forces commanded by Mare&s;chal
de Villars, and drove the Imperiali&s;ts out of the Milane&s;e.
His Imperial Maje&s;ty dreading the effects of &s;uch a power|ful
confederacy again&s;t him, offered to compromi&s;e all
differences with the crown of Spain, under the mediation
of the King of Great-Britain; and Mr. Keene, the Briti&s;h
mini&s;ter at Madrid, propo&s;ed an accommodation. Philip
expre&s;&s;ed his acknowledgements to the King of England,
declaring, however, that the Emperor's advances were too
<PB N="488" REF="494">
late; and that his own re&s;olutions were already taken.
Neverthele&s;s, he &s;ent orders to the Count de Montijo, his
amba&s;&s;ador at London, to communicate to his Britannick
Maje&s;ty the motives which had induced him to take the&s;e
re&s;olutions. In the mean time, he detached a powerful
armament to Italy, where they inve&s;ted the Imperial fortre&s;s
of Aula, the garri&s;on of which were obliged to &s;urrender
them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war. The republick of Venice de|clared
&s;he would take no &s;hare in the di&s;putes of Italy;
the States-General &s;igned a neutrality with the French King
for the Au&s;trian Netherlands, without con&s;ulting the Em|peror
or the King of Great-Britain; and the Engli&s;h coun|cils
&s;eemed to be altogether pacifick.</P>
<P>&sect; XI. In November the Prince of Orange arrived at
Greenwich, in order to e&s;pou&s;e the Prince&s;s Royal; but
the marriage was po&s;tponed on account of his being taken
ill; and he repaired to Bath in Somer&s;et&s;hire, to drink
the waters for the recovery of his &s;trength. Henrietta the
young Duche&s;s of Marlborough dying about this time,
the title devolved to her &s;i&s;ter's &s;on, the Earl of Sunder|land.
Lord King re&s;igning his office of chancellor, it
was conferred upon Mr. Talbot, &s;ollicitor-general, together
with the title of a baron; a promotion that reflected
honour upon tho&s;e by whom it was advi&s;ed. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
the &s;pirit of a Roman &s;enator, the elegance of an Atticus,
and the integrity of a Cato. At the meeting of the parlia|ment
in January, the King told them, in his &s;peech,
that though he was no way engaged in the war which had
begun to rage in Europe, except by the good offices he
had employed among the contending powers, he could not
$word$ regardle&s;s of the pre&s;ent events, or be unconcerned for
the con&s;equences of a war undertaken and &s;upported by
&s;uch a powerful alliance. He &s;aid he had thought proper
to take time to examine the facts alledged on both &s;ides,
and to wait the re&s;ult of the councils of tho&s;e powers that
were more immediately intere&s;ted in the con&s;equences of
the rupture. He declared he would concert with his
allies, more particularly with the States-General of the
<PB N="489" REF="495">
United Provinces, &s;uch mea&s;ures as &s;hould be thought mo&s;t
advi&s;eable for their common &s;afety, and for re&s;toring the
peace of Europe. In the mean time, he expre&s;&s;ed his hope
that they would make &s;uch provi&s;ion as &s;hould &s;ecure his
kingdom, rights, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions from all dangers and in|&s;ults,
and maintain the re&s;pect due to the Briti&s;h nation.
He &s;aid, that whatever part it might in the end be mo&s;t
rea&s;onable for him to act, it would in all views be nece&s;&s;ary,
when all Europe was preparing for arms, to put his king|doms
in a po&s;ture of defence. The motion for an addre&s;s
of thanks produced, as u&s;ual, a debate in both Hou&s;es,
which, it mu&s;t be owned, appears to have proceeded from
a &s;pirit of cavilling, rather than from any rea&s;onable cau&s;e
of objection.</P>
<P>&sect; XII. The Hou&s;e of Commons re&s;olved to addre&s;s his
Maje&s;ty for a copy of the treaty of Vienna. Sir John
Ru&s;hout moved for another, de&s;iring that the letters and
in&s;tructions relating to the execution of the treaty of
Seville &s;hould be &s;ubmitted to the in&s;pection of the Com|mons;
but, after a hard &s;truggle, it was over-ruled.
The next motion was made by Mr. Sandys, a gentleman
who had for &s;ome time appeared &s;trenuous in the oppo|&s;ition,
and wrangled with great per&s;everance. He pro|po&s;ed
that the Hou&s;e &s;hould examine the in&s;tructions which
had been given to the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter in Poland, &s;ome
years before the death of King Augu&s;tus, that they might
be the better able to judge of the cau&s;es which produced
this new rupture among the powers of Europe. The
motion being oppo&s;ed by all the court members, a conte&s;t
en&s;ued, in the cour&s;e of which Mr. Pultency compared
the mini&s;try to an empyrick, and the con&s;titution of Eng|land
to his patient. &startq;This pretender in phy&s;ick (&s;aid he)
being con&s;ulted, tells the di&s;tempered per&s;on, there were
but two or three ways of treating his di&s;ea&s;e; and he was
afraid that none of them would &s;ucceed. A vomit might
throw him into convul&s;ions that would occa&s;ion immediate
death; a purge might bring on a diarrhoea that would
carry him off in a &s;hort time; and he had been already
<PB N="490" REF="496">
bled &s;o much, and &s;o often, that he could bear it no longer.
The unfortunate patient &s;hocked at this declaration, re|plies,
&startq;Sir, you have always pretended to be a regular
doctor, but I now find you are an arrant quack. I
had an excellent con&s;titution when I fir&s;t fell into
your hands, but you have quite de&s;troyed it; and now
I find I have no other chance for &s;aving my life, but
by calling for the help of &s;ome regular phy&s;ician.&endq; In
the debate, the members on both &s;ides &s;eemed to wander
from the que&s;tion, and indulge them&s;elves with ludicrous
per&s;onalities. Mr. H. Walpole took occa&s;ion to &s;ay, that
the oppo&s;ition treated the mini&s;try as he him&s;elf was treat|ed
by &s;ome of his acquaintance, with re&s;pect to his dre&s;s.
&startq;If I am in plain clothes (&s;aid he) then they call me a
&s;lovenly, dirty fellow; and if by chance I wear a laced
&s;uit, they cry, What, &s;hall &s;uch an aukward fellow
wear fine clothes?&endq; He continued to &s;port in this kind
of idle buffonery. He compared the pre&s;ent admini&s;tra|tion
to a &s;hip at &s;ea. As long as the wind was fair, and
proper for carrying us to our de&s;igned port, the word was
&startq;Steady! &s;teady!&endq; but when the wind began to &s;hift and
change, the word was nece&s;&s;arily altered to &startq;Thus,
thus, and no near.&endq; The motion was overpowered by
the majority; and this was the fate of &s;everal other propo|&s;als
made by the members in the oppo&s;ition. Sir John
Barnard pre&s;ented a petition from the druggi&s;ts, and other
dealers in tea, complaining of the in&s;ults and oppre&s;&s;ion
to which they were &s;ubjected by the exci&s;e laws, and im|ploring
relief. Sir John and Mr. Perry, another of the city-members,
explained the grievous hard&s;hips which tho&s;e
traders &s;u&s;tained, and moved that the petition might be re|ferred
to the con&s;ideration of the whole Hou&s;e. They were
oppo&s;ed by Mr. Winnington, Sir W. Yonge, and other
parti&s;ans of the mini&s;try; and the&s;e &s;kirmi&s;hes brought on
a general engagement of the two parties, in which every
weapon of &s;atire, argument, rea&s;on, and truth was wield|ed
again&s;t that odious, arbitrary, and oppre&s;&s;ive method of
<PB N="491" REF="497">
collecting the publick revenue. Neverthele&s;s, the motion
in favour of the &s;ufferers was rejected.</P>
<P>&sect; XIII. When the Commons deliberated upon the &s;up|ply,
Mr. Andrews, deputy-payma&s;ter of the army, moved
for an addition of eighteen hundred men to the number of
land-forces which had been continued &s;ince the preceding
year. The members in the oppo&s;ition di&s;puted this &s;mall
augmentation with too much heat and eagerne&s;s. It mu&s;t
be acknowledged, they were by this time irritated into &s;uch
per&s;onal animo&s;ity again&s;t the mini&s;ter, that they re&s;olved
to oppo&s;e all his mea&s;ures, whether they might or might
not be nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;afety and advantage of the king|dom.
Nor indeed were they altogether blameable for act|ing
on this maxim, if their &s;ole aim was to remove from
the confidence and councils of their &s;overeign a man
who&s;e conduct they thought prejudicial to the intere&s;t and
liberties of their country. They could not, however,
prevent the augmentation propo&s;ed: but they re&s;olved, if
they could not wholly &s;top the career of the mini&s;try, to
throw in &s;uch a number of rubs as &s;hould at lea&s;t retard
their progre&s;s. The Duke of Bolton and Lord Cobham
had been deprived of the regiments they commanded, be|cau&s;e
they refu&s;ed to concur in every project of the admi|ni&s;tration.
It was in con&s;equence of their di&s;mi&s;&s;ion that
Lord Morpeth moved for a bill to prevent any commi&s;&s;ion-officer,
not above the rank of a colonel, from being re|moved,
unle&s;s by a court-martial, or by addre&s;s of either
Hou&s;e of parliament. Such an attack on the prerogative
might have &s;ucceeded in the latter part of the reign of the
fir&s;t Charles; but at this juncture could not &s;ail to mi&s;|carry:
yet it was &s;u&s;tained with great vigour and addre&s;s.
When the propo&s;al was &s;et a&s;ide by the majority, Mr.
Sandys moved for an addre&s;s to the King, de&s;iring to know
who advi&s;ed his Maje&s;ty to remove the Duke of Bolton
and Lord Cobham from their re&s;pective regiments. He
was &s;econded by Mr. Pulteney and Sir William Wynd|ham:
but the mini&s;try fore&s;eeing another tedious di&s;pute
called for the que&s;tion, and the motion was carried in the
<PB N="492" REF="498">
negative. The next &s;ource of contention was a bill for
&s;ecuring the freedom of parliament, by limiting the number
of officers in the Hou&s;e of Commons. It was read a fir&s;t
and &s;econd time; but, when a motion was made for its
being committed, it met with a powerful oppo&s;ition, and
produced a warm debate that i&s;&s;ued in a que&s;tion which,
like the former, pa&s;&s;ed in the negative. A clergyman
having in&s;inuated in conver&s;ation, that Sir William Mil|ner,
baronet, member for York, received a pen&s;ion from
the mini&s;try, the Hou&s;e took cognizance of this report:
the clergyman acknowledged at the bar that he might have
dropped &s;uch a hint from hear&s;ay. The accu&s;ed member
prote&s;ted, upon his honour, that he never did, or ever
would receive, place, pen&s;ion, gratuity, or reward from
the court, either directly or indirectly, for voting in parlia|ment,
or upon any other account whatever. The accu&s;a|tion
was voted fal&s;e and &s;candalous, and the accu&s;er taken
into cu&s;tody; but in a few days he was di&s;charged upon
his humble petition, and his begging pardon of the mem|ber
whom he had calumniated. The duty upon &s;alt was
prolonged for eight years; and a bill pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t &s;tock-jobbing.</P>
<P>&sect; XIV. But the &s;ubject which of all others employed
the eloquence and abilities on both &s;ides to the mo&s;t vigo|rous
exertion, was a motion made by Mr. Bromley, who
propo&s;ed that a bill &s;hould be brought in for repealing the
&s;eptennial act, and for the more frequent meeting and
calling of parliaments. The arguments for and again&s;t
&s;eptennial parliaments have already been &s;tated. The
mini&s;try now in&s;i&s;ted upon the increa&s;e of papi&s;ts and
Jacobites, which rendered it dangerous to weaken the
hands of the government: they challenged the oppo&s;ition to
produce one in&s;tance in which the lea&s;t encroachment had
been made on the liberties of the people &s;ince the &s;eptennial
act took place; and they de&s;ied the mo&s;t ingenious malice
to prove that his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty had ever endeavoured to
extend any branch of the prerogative beyond its legal
bounds. Sir John Hinde Cotton affirmed, that in many
<PB N="493" REF="499">
parts of England the papi&s;ts had already begun to u&s;e all
their influence in favour of tho&s;e candidates who were re|commended
by the mini&s;ters as members in the en&s;uing
parliament. With re&s;pect to his Maje&s;ty's conduct, he
&s;aid he would not an&s;wer one word; but as to the griev|ances
introduced &s;ince the law was enacted for &s;eptennial
parliaments, he thought him&s;elf more at liberty to declare
his &s;entiments. He a&s;&s;erted that the &s;eptennial law it&s;elf
was an encroachment on the rights of the people; a law
pa&s;&s;ed by a parliament that made it&s;elf &s;eptennial. He
ob&s;erved, that the laws of trea&s;on with regard to trials
were altered &s;ince that period: that in former times a man
was tried by a jury of his neighbours, within the country
where the crimes alledged again&s;t him were &s;aid to be com|mitted;
but by an act of a &s;eptennial parliament he might be
removed and tried in any place where the crown, or rather
the mini&s;try, could find a jury proper for their purpo&s;e;
where the pri&s;oner could not bring any witne&s;s in his
ju&s;tification, without an expen&s;e which perhaps his circum|&s;tances
would not bear. He a&s;ked if the riot act was not
an encroachment on the rights of the people? An act by
which a little dirty ju&s;tice of the peace, the meane&s;t and
vile&s;t tool a mini&s;ter can u&s;e, who perhaps &s;ub&s;its by his
being in the commi&s;&s;ion, and may be deprived of that &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence
at the plea&s;ure of his patron, had it in his power
to put twenty or thirty of the be&s;t &s;ubjects in England to
immediate death, without any trial or form but that of
reading a proclamation. &startq;Was not the fatal South-Sea
&s;cheme (&s;aid he) e&s;tabli&s;hed by the act of a &s;eptennial
parliament? And can any man a&s;k, whether that law
was attended with any inconvenience? To the glorious
catalogue I might have added the late exci&s;e-bill, if it
had pa&s;&s;ed into a law; but, thank heaven, the &s;eptennial
parliament was near expiring before that famous mea&s;ure
was introduced.&endq;</P>
<P>&sect; XV. Sir William Wyndham concluded an excellent
&s;peech, that &s;poke him the unrivalled orator, the uncor|rupted
Briton, and the un&s;haken patriot, in words to this
<PB N="494" REF="500">
effect: &startq;Let us &s;uppo&s;e a man abandoned to all notions
of virtue and honour, of no great family, and but a
mean fortune, rai&s;ed to be chief mini&s;ter of &s;tate,
by the concurrence of many whim&s;ical events; afraid,
or unwilling, to tru&s;t any but creatures of his own ma|king;
lo&s;t to all &s;en&s;e of &s;hame and reputation; igno|rant
of his country's true intere&s;t; pur&s;uing no aim but
that of aggrandizing him&s;elf and his favourites; in fo|reign
affairs tru&s;ting none but tho&s;e who, from the
nature of their education, cannot po&s;&s;ibly be qualified
for the &s;ervice of their country, or give weight and
credit to their negociations. Let us &s;uppo&s;e the true
intere&s;t of the nation, by &s;uch means, neglected or
mi&s;under&s;tood, her honour tarni&s;hed, her importance
lo&s;t, her trade in&s;ulted, her merchants plundered, and
her &s;ailors murthered; and all the&s;e circum&s;tances over-looked,
le&s;t his admini&s;tration &s;hould be endangered.
Suppo&s;e him next po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of immen&s;e wealth, the
plunder of the nation, with a parliament chiefly com|po&s;ed
of members who&s;e &s;eats are purcha&s;ed, and
who&s;e votes are bought at the expen&s;e of the publick
trea&s;ure. In &s;uch a parliament, &s;uppo&s;e all attempt$
made to enquire into his conduct, or to relieve the
nation from the di&s;tre&s;s which has been entailed upon
it by his admini&s;tration. Suppo&s;e him &s;creened by a
corrupt majority of his creatures, whom he retains in
daily pay, or engages in his particular intere&s;t, by di|&s;tributing
among them tho&s;e po&s;ts and places which
ought never to be be&s;towed upon any but for the good
of the publick. Let him plume him&s;elf upon his
&s;candalous victory, becau&s;e he has obtained a parliament
like a packed jury ready to acquit him at all adventures.
Let us &s;uppo&s;e him domineering with in&s;olence over all
the men of ancient families, over all the men of &s;en&s;e,
figure, or fortune in the nation: as he has no virtue
of his own, ridiculing it in others, and endeavouring
to de&s;troy or corrupt it in all. With &s;uch a mini&s;ter,
and &s;uch a parliament, let us &s;uppo&s;e a ca&s;e which I
<PB N="495" REF="501">
hope will never happen:<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. V. 1733.</NOTE> a prince upon the throne, un|informed,
ignorant, and unacquainted with the incli|nations
and true intere&s;t of his people, weak, capri|cious,
tran&s;ported with unbounded ambition, and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
with in&s;atiable avarice. I hope &s;uch a ca&s;e will
never occur; but, as it po&s;&s;ibly may, could any greater
cur&s;e happen to a nation, than &s;uch a prince on the
throne, advi&s;ed, and &s;olely advi&s;ed, by &s;uch a mini&s;ter,
and that mini&s;ter &s;upported by &s;uch a parliament. The
nature of mankind cannot be altered by human laws:
the exi&s;tence of &s;uch a prince or &s;uch a mini&s;ter we
cannot prevent by act of parliament; but the exi&s;tence
of &s;uch a parliament I think we may prevent; as it is
much more likely to exi&s;t, and may do more mi&s;chief
while the &s;eptennial law remains in force, than if it
were repealed; therefore, I am heartily for its being re|pealed.&endq;
Notwith&s;tanding the mo&s;t warm, the mo&s;t
nervous, the mo&s;t pathetick remon&s;trances in favour of
the motion, the que&s;tion was put, and it was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by
mere dint of number.</P>
<P>&sect; XVI. The triumph of the mini&s;try was &s;till more com|plete
in the &s;ucce&s;s of a me&s;&s;age delivered from the crown
in the latter end of the &s;e&s;&s;ion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1734&punc;</NOTE> when a great many mem|bers
of the other party had retired to their re&s;pective habi|tations
in the country. Sir Robert Walpole delivered this
commi&s;&s;ion to the Hou&s;e, importing, that his Maje&s;ty
might be enabled to augment his &s;orces, if occa&s;ion &s;hould
require &s;uch an augmentation, between the di&s;&s;olution of
this parliament and the election of another. Such an im|portant
point, that was &s;aid to &s;trike at the foundation of
our liberties, was not tamely yielded; but, on the contrary,
conte&s;ted with uncommon ardour. The motion for taking
the me&s;&s;age into con&s;ideration was carried in the affir|mative;
and an addre&s;s pre&s;ented to the King, &s;ignifying
their compliance with his de&s;ire. In con&s;equence of a
&s;ub&s;equent me&s;&s;age, they prepared and pa&s;&s;ed a bill, ena|bling
his Maje&s;ty to &s;ettle an annuity of five thou&s;and
<PB N="496" REF="502">
pounds for life on the Prince&s;s Royal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1734.</NOTE> as a mark of his
paternal favour and affection.</P>
<P>&sect; XVII. The oppo&s;ition in the Hou&s;e of Peers kept pace
with that in the Hou&s;e of Commons, and was &s;upported
with equal abilities, under the au&s;pices of the Lords
Bathur&s;t and Carteret, the Earls of Che&s;terfield and Abing|don.
The Duke of Marlborough made a motion for a
bill to regulate the army, equivalent to that which had
been rejected in the Lower Hou&s;e; and it met with the
&s;ame fate after a warm di&s;pute. Then Lord Carteret
moved for an addre&s;s to the King, that he would be gra|ciou&s;ly
plea&s;ed to acquaint the Hou&s;e who advi&s;ed his Ma|je&s;ty
to remove the Duke of Bolton and Lord Vi&s;count
Cobham from their re&s;pective regiments; and what crimes
were laid to their charge. This propo&s;al was likewi&s;e
rejected, at the end of a debate in which the Duke of Ar|gyle
ob&s;erved, that two lords had been removed, but only
one &s;oldier had lo&s;t his commi&s;&s;ion. Such a great majority
of the Scotti&s;h repre&s;entatives had always voted for the
mini&s;try &s;ince the acce&s;&s;ion of the late King; and &s;o many
of the&s;e enjoyed places and preferments in the gift of the
crown, that &s;everal attempts were made by the lords in
the oppo&s;ition, to prevent for the future the mini&s;terial in|fluence
from extending it&s;elf to the elections of North-Britain.
Accordingly, two motions for this purpo&s;e were
made by the Earl of Marchmont and the Duke of Bedford;
and &s;u&s;tained by the Earls of Che&s;terfield, Winchel&s;ea,
and Stair, Lords Willoughby de Broke, Bathur&s;t, and
Carteret. They were oppo&s;ed by the Dukes of New|ca&s;tle
and Argyle, the Earl of Cholmondeley, Earl Paulet,
Lord Hervey, now called up by writ to the Hou&s;e of Peers,
and Lord Talbot. The que&s;tion being put on both,
they were of cour&s;e defeated; and the Earl of Stair was
deprived of his regiment of dragoons, after having per|formed
the mo&s;t &s;ignal &s;ervices to the royal family, and ex|hau&s;ted
his fortune in &s;upporting the intere&s;ts and dignity
of the crown. Strenuous prote&s;ts were entered again&s;t the
deci&s;ion of the majority concerning the King's me&s;&s;age
<PB N="497" REF="503">
demanding a power to augment his forces during the re|ce&s;s
of parliament;<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. V. 1734.</NOTE> as al&s;o again&s;t a bill for enabling his
Maje&s;ty to apply the &s;um of one million two hundred
thou&s;and pounds out of the &s;inking-fund, for the &s;ervice
of the current year. The bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;e&s;&s;ion being
di&s;patched, the King repaired to the Hou&s;e of Lords on
the &s;ixteenth day of April, and having pa&s;&s;ed all the bills
that were ready for the royal a&s;&s;ent, took leave of this
parliament, with the warme&s;t acknowledgement of their
zeal, duty, and affection. It was at fir&s;t prorogued, then
di&s;&s;olved, and another convoked by the &s;ame proclama|tion.
On the fourteenth day of March, the nuptials of
the Prince of Orange and the Prince&s;s Royal were &s;olemn|ized
with great magnificence; and this match was at|tended
with addre&s;&s;es of congratulation to his Maje&s;ty from
different parts of the kingdom.</P>
<P>&sect; XVIII. The powers at war upon the continent
acted with &s;urpri&s;ing vigour. The Ru&s;&s;ian and Saxon
army inve&s;ted the city of Dantzick, in hopes of &s;ecuring
the per&s;on of King Stani&s;laus. The town was &s;trong,
the garri&s;on numerous, and, animated by the examples of
the French and Poles, made a very ob&s;tinate defence. For
&s;ome time they were &s;upplied by &s;ea with recruits, arms,
and ammunition. On the eleventh day of May a re-en|forcement
of fifteen hundred men was landed from two
French &s;hips of war and &s;ome tran&s;ports, under Fort
Wech&s;elmunde, which was &s;o much in want of provi|&s;ions,
that they were not admitted: they, therefore, re-em|barked,
and &s;ailed back to Copenhagen. But afterwards
a larger number were landed in the &s;ame place, and at|tacked
the Ru&s;&s;ian entrenchments, in order to force their
way into the city. They were repul&s;ed in this attempt,
but retired in good order. At length the Ru&s;&s;ian &s;leet
arrived, under the command of Admiral Gordon; and
now the &s;iege was carried on with great fury. Fort Wech|&s;elmunde
was &s;urrendered: the French troops capitulated,
and were embarked in the Ru&s;&s;ian &s;hips, to be conveyed
to &s;ome port in the Baltick. Stani&s;laus e&s;caped in the di&s;|gui&s;e
<PB N="498" REF="504">
of a pea&s;ant to Marienwarder in the Pru&s;&s;ian terri|tories.
The city of Dantzick &s;ubmitted to the dominion
of Augu&s;tus III. King of Poland, and was obliged to de|fray
the expen&s;e of the war to the Ru&s;&s;ian General Count
de Munich, who had a&s;&s;umed the command after the &s;iege
was begun. The Poli&s;h lords at Dantzick &s;igned an
act of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to King Augu&s;tus, who, on the tenth
day of July, arrived at the convent of Oliva. There a
council was held in his pre&s;ence. The recu&s;ant noblemen
took the oath which he propo&s;ed. Then a general amne&s;ty
was proclaimed; and the King &s;et out on his return to
Dre&s;den.</P>
<P>&sect; XIX. On the Rhine the French arms bore down all
re&s;i&s;tance. The Count de Bellei&s;le be&s;ieged and took
Traerbach. The Duke of Berwick, at the head of &s;ixty
thou&s;and men, inve&s;ted Philip&s;burgh, while Prince Eugene
was obliged to remain on the defen&s;ive, in the &s;trong camp
at Heilbron, waiting for the troops of the empire. On
the twelfth day of June, the Duke of Berwick, in vi&s;iting
the trenches, was killed by a cannon-ball, and the com|mand
devolved upon the Marquis d'Asfeldt, who carried
on the operations of the &s;iege with equal vigour and capa|city.
Prince Eugene, being joined by the different re-en|forcements
he expected, marched towards the French
lines; but found them &s;o &s;trong, that he would not hazard
an attack; and &s;uch precautions taken, that with all his
military talents he could not relieve the be&s;ieged. At
length General Watgenau, the governour, capitulated, after
having made a noble defence, and obtained the mo&s;t honour|able
conditions. Prince Eugene retired to Heidelberg; and
the campaign ended about the beginning of October.
The Imperial arms were not more &s;ucce&s;sful in Italy.
The Infant Don Carlos had received &s;o many invitations
from the Neapolitan nobility, that he re&s;olved to take
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that kingdom. He began his march in Febru|ary,
at the head of the Spani&s;h forces; publi&s;hed a mani|fe&s;to,
declaring he was &s;ent by his father to relieve the
kingdom of Naples from the oppre&s;&s;ion under which it
<PB N="499" REF="505">
groaned; and entered the capital amid&s;t the acclamations
of the people; while the Count de Vi&s;comti, the German
viceroy, finding him&s;elf unable to cope with the invaders,
thought proper to retire, after having thrown &s;uccours
into Gaeta and Capua. When he arrived at Nocera, he
began to a&s;&s;emble the militia, with intent to form a camp
at Barletta. The Count de Montemar marched with a
body of forces again&s;t this general, and obtained over him
a complete victory at Bitonto in Apuglia, on the twenty-fifth
of May, when the Imperiali&s;ts were entirely routed,
and a great number of principal officers taken pri&s;oners.
Don Carlos being proclaimed, and acknowledged King of
Naples, created the Count de Montemar Duke of Bitonto;
reduced Gaeta, and all other parts of the kingdom
which were garri&s;oned with Imperial troops; and re&s;olved
to &s;ubdue the i&s;land of Sicily. About twenty thou&s;and
troops being de&s;tined for this expedition were landed in
the road of Solanto in Augu&s;t, under the command of the
new Duke of Bitonto, who being favoured by the natives,
proceeded in his conque&s;ts with great rapidity. The people
acknowledged Don Carlos as their &s;overeign, and took
arms in &s;upport of his government; &s;o that the Imperial
troops were driven before them, and the Spaniards po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
the whole kingdom, except Me&s;&s;ina, Syracu&s;e, and
Trepani, when the Infant determined to vi&s;it the i&s;land in
per&s;on.</P>
<P>&sect; XX. While Don Carlos was thus employed in the
conque&s;t of Naples and Sicily, the Imperiali&s;ts were hard
pre&s;&s;ed in Lombardy by the united forces of France and
Piedmont, commanded by the King of Sardinia and the
old Mare&s;chal Duke de Villars. In the month of Janu|ary
they undertook the &s;iege of Tortona, which they re|duced;
while the troops of the Emperor began to pour in
great numbers into the Mantuan. In the beginning of
May, Count Merci, who commanded them, pa&s;&s;ed the
Po in the face of the allies, notwith&s;tanding all the &s;kill of
Villars, obliged him to retreat from the banks of that
river, and took the ca&s;tle of Colorno. The old French
<PB N="500" REF="506">
general being taken ill, quitted the army, and retired to
Turin, where in a little time he died; and the King of
Sardinia retiring to the &s;ame place, the command of the
allied forces devolved upon the Mare&s;chal de Coigny.
The confederates were po&s;ted at Sanguina, and the Im|periali&s;ts
at Sorbola, when the Count de Merci made a
motion to San Pro&s;pero, as if he intended either to attack
the enemy, or take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Parma. The Mare&s;chal
de Coigny forthwith made a di&s;po&s;ition for an engagement;
and, on the twenty-ninth day of June, the Imperial gene|ral
having pa&s;&s;ed the Parma, began the attack with great
impetuo&s;ity. He charged in per&s;on at the head of his troops
and was killed &s;oon after the battle began. Neverthele&s;s,
the Prince of Wirtemberg a&s;&s;uming the command, both
armies fought with great ob&s;tinacy, from eleven in the
forenoon till four in the afternoon, when the Imperiali&s;ts
retired towards Monte Cirugalo, leaving five thou&s;and
men dead on the field of battle, and among the&s;e many
officers of di&s;tinction. The lo&s;s of the allies was very
con&s;iderable, and they reaped no &s;olid fruits from their
victory.</P>
<P>&sect; XXI. The Imperial forces retreated to Reggio, and
from thence moved to the plains of Carpi, on the right of
the Secchia, where they received &s;ome re-enforcements:
then General Count Konig&s;egg arriving in the camp, took
upon him&s;elf the command of the army. His fir&s;t &s;tep
was to take po&s;t at Quingentolo, by which motion
he &s;ecured Mirandola, that was threatened with a &s;iege.
On the fifteenth of February he &s;orded the river Secchia,
and &s;urpri&s;ed the quarters of Mare&s;chal de Broglio, who
e&s;caped in his &s;hirt with great difficulty. The French
retired with &s;uch precipitation, that they left all their
baggage behind, and above two thou&s;and were taken pri|&s;oners.
They po&s;ted them&s;elves under Gua&s;talla, where,
on the nineteenth day of the month, they were vigorou&s;ly
attacked by the Imperiali&s;ts, and a general engagement
en&s;ued. Konig&s;egg made &s;everal de&s;perate efforts to break
the French cavalry, upon which, however, he could
<PB N="501" REF="507">
make no impre&s;&s;ion. The infantry on both &s;ides fought
with uncommon ardour for &s;ix hours, and the field was
covered with carnage. At length the Imperial general
retreated to Lazara, after having lo&s;t above five thou&s;and
men, including the Prince of Wirtemberg, the Generals
Valpareze and Colminero, with many other officers of
di&s;tinction: nor was the damage &s;u&s;tained by the French
greatly inferior to that of the Germans, who repa&s;&s;ed the
Po, and took po&s;t on the Banks of the Oglio. The allies
cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ame river, and the Marquis de Maillebois was
&s;ent with a detachment to attack Mirandola; but the Im|periali&s;ts
marching to the relief of the place, compelled
him to abandon the enterpri&s;e: then he rejoined his army,
which retired under the walls of Cremona, to wait for
&s;uccours from Don Carlos. So little re&s;pect did the
French court pay to the Briti&s;h nation, at this juncture,
that in the month of November an edict was publi&s;hed in
Paris, commanding all the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects in France,
who were not actually in employment, from the age of
eighteen to fifty, to quit the kingdom in fifteen days,
or inli&s;t in &s;ome of the Iri&s;h regiments, on pain of being
treated as vagabonds, and &s;ent to the gallies. This edict
was executed with the utmo&s;t rigour. The pri&s;ons of
Paris were crouded with the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain,
who were &s;urpri&s;ed and cut off from all communication
with their friends, and mu&s;t have peri&s;hed by cold and
hunger, had not they been relieved by the active charity of
the Jan&s;eni&s;ts. The Earl of Waldegrave, who then re|&s;ided
at Paris as amba&s;&s;adour from the King of Great-Britain,
made &s;uch vigorous remon&s;trances to the
French mini&s;try, upon this unheard of outrage again&s;t a
nation with which they had been &s;o long in alliance, that
they thought proper to &s;et the pri&s;oners at liberty, and
publi&s;h another edict, by which the meaning of the former
was explained away.</P>
<P>&sect; XXII. While the&s;e tran&s;actions occurred on the con|tinent,
the King of Great-Britain augmented his land-forces;
and warm conte&s;ts were maintained through the
<PB N="502" REF="508">
whole united kingdom in electing repre&s;entatives for the
new parliament. But in all the&s;e &s;truggles the mini&s;terial
power predominated; and the new members appeared with
the old complexion. The two Hou&s;es a&s;&s;embled on the
fourteenth day of January, and Mr. On&s;low was re-elected
Speaker. The leaders of both parties in all debates were
the &s;elf-&s;ame per&s;ons who had conducted tho&s;e of the former
parliament; and the &s;ame mea&s;ures were pur&s;ued in the
&s;ame manner. The King, in his &s;peech at the opening
of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, gave them to under&s;tand, that he had con|certed
with the States-General of the United Provinces
&s;uch mea&s;ures as were thought mo&s;t advi&s;eable for their
common &s;afety, and for re&s;toring the peace of Europe:
that they had con&s;idered on one &s;ide the pre&s;&s;ing applications
made by the Imperial court both in England and Holland,
for obtaining &s;uccours again&s;t the powers at war with the
hou&s;e of Au&s;tria; and on the other &s;ide, the repeated pro|fe&s;&s;ions
made by the allies, of their &s;incere di&s;po&s;ition to
put an end to the pre&s;ent troubles upon honourable and
&s;olid terms: that he and the States-General had concurred
in a re&s;olution to employ their joint and earne&s;t in&s;tances to
bring matters to a &s;peedy and happy accommodation:
that their good offices were at length accepted; and in a
&s;hort time a plan would be offered to the con&s;ideration of
all parties engaged in the war, as a ba&s;is for a general ne|gociation
of peace. He told them he had u&s;ed the power
$e&s;ted in him by the la&s;t parliament with great moderation;
and concluded a treaty with the crown of Denmark of great
importance in the pre&s;ent conjuncture. He ob&s;erved,
that whil&s;t many of the principal powers of Europe were
actually engaged in a war, Great-Britain mu&s;t be more or
le&s;s affected with the con&s;equences; and as the be&s;t con|certed
mea&s;ures are liable to uncertainty, the nation ought
to be prepared again&s;t all events. He, therefore, expre&s;&s;ed
his hope, that his good &s;ubjects would not repine at the
nece&s;&s;ary means of procuring the ble&s;&s;ings of peace and
univer&s;al tranquillity, or of putting him in a condition to
act that part which it might be nece&s;&s;ary and incumbent
<PB N="503" REF="509">
upon him to take. The addre&s;s of thanks produced a
di&s;pute as u&s;ual, which ended with an acquie&s;cence in the
motion. The Hou&s;e, in a grand committee on the &s;upply,
re&s;olved, That thirty thou&s;and &s;eamen &s;hould be employed
for the &s;ervice of the en&s;uing year; and, That the land-forces
&s;hould be augmented to the number of twenty-five
thou&s;and &s;even hundred and forty-four effective men.
But the&s;e re&s;olutions were not taken without di&s;pute and
divi&s;ion. The mini&s;ter's opponents not only re-produced
all the rea&s;ons which had been formerly advanced again&s;t a
&s;tanding army, but they oppo&s;ed this augmentation with
extraordinary ardour, as a huge &s;tride towards the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment
of arbitrary power. They refuted tho&s;e fears of
external broils on which the mini&s;try pretended to ground
the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch an augmentation; and they expo&s;ed
the weak conduct of the admini&s;tration, in having con|tributed
to de&s;troy the balance of power, by a&s;&s;i&s;ting Spain
again&s;t the Emperor in Italy, &s;o as to aggrandize the Hou&s;e
of Bourbon.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIII. Sir William Wyndham moved, that the
e&s;timate of the navy for the en&s;uing year might be referred
to a &s;elect committee. He expre&s;&s;ed his &s;urpri&s;e, that
notwith&s;tanding the va&s;t &s;ums which had been yearly
rai&s;ed, and the long continuance of the peace, the people
had not been quite delivered of any one tax incurred in the
preceding war. He &s;aid, he could not comprehend how
it was po&s;&s;ible to find pretences for expo&s;ing the nation to
&s;uch exorbitant charges; and he took notice of &s;ome un|con&s;cionable
articles in the accounts of the navy-debt that
lay upon the table. He was &s;econded by Mr. Sandys,
and &s;upported by Sir Jo&s;eph Jekyll and Mr. Pulteney;
but after &s;ome debate the motion was carried in the nega|tive.
When the new treaty with Denmark fell under
con&s;ideration in a grand committee, Mr. H. Walpole
moved, that the &s;um of fifty-&s;ix thou&s;and two hundred and
fifty pounds &s;hould be granted to his Maje&s;ty, as a &s;ub&s;idy
to the Dane, pur&s;uant to the &s;aid treaty, for the &s;ervice of
the en&s;uing year. The demand did not meet with imme|diate
<PB N="504" REF="510">
compliance. All the leaders in the oppo&s;ition ex|claimed
again&s;t the &s;ub&s;idy as unnece&s;&s;ary and unrea&s;onable.
They ob&s;erved, that as the Engli&s;h had no particular in|tere&s;t
of their own for inducing them to engage in the
pre&s;ent war, but only the danger to which the balance of
power might be expo&s;ed by that event; and as all the
powers of Europe were as much, if not more, intere&s;ted
than the Engli&s;h in the pre&s;ervation of that balance,
&s;hould it ever be really endangered, they would certainly
engage in its defence, without receiving any valuable con|&s;ideration
from Great-Britain; but, &s;hould the Engli&s;h be
always the fir&s;t to take the alarm upon any rupture, and
offer bribes and pen&s;ions to all the princes in Europe, the
whole charge of pre&s;erving that balance would fall upon
Great-Britain: every &s;tate would expect a gratification
from her, for doing that which it would otherwi&s;e be obli|ged
to do for its own pre&s;ervation: even the Dutch might
at la&s;t refu&s;e to a&s;&s;i&s;t in trimming this balance, unle&s;s Bri|tain
&s;hould &s;ubmit to make the Grand Pen&s;ionary of Hol|land
a pen&s;ionary of England, and take a number of their
forces into Engli&s;h pay. The debate having had its free
cour&s;e, the que&s;tion was put, and the motion approved by
the majority. The mini&s;try allowed a bill to be brought
in for limiting the number of officers in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons;
but at the &s;econd reading it was rejected upon a
divi&s;ion, after a learned debate, in which it appeared that
the oppo&s;ition had gained a valuable auxiliary in the per&s;on
of Lord Polwarth, &s;on to the Earl of Marchmont, a noble|man
of elegant parts, keen penetration, and uncommon
vivacity, who &s;poke with all the fluency and fervour of
elo$ution.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIV. The minority in the Hou&s;e of Lords were not
le&s;s vigilant and re&s;olute in detecting and oppo&s;ing every
mea&s;ure which they thought would redound to the prejudice
of their country. But the mo&s;t remarkable object that em|ployed
their attention during this &s;e&s;&s;ion was a very extraordi|nary
petition, &s;ub&s;cribed by the Dukes of Hamilton, Queen&s;|berry,
and Montro&s;e, the Earls of Dundonald, Marchmont&punc;
<PB N="505" REF="511">
and Stair, repre&s;enting, that undue influence had been u&s;ed
for carrying on the election of the &s;ixteen peers for Scot|land.
The Duke of Bedford, who delivered their petition
to the Hou&s;e, propo&s;ed a day for taking it into con&s;ider|ation;
and to this they agreed. It was afterwards moved,
that the con&s;ideration of it &s;hould be adjourned to a &s;hort
day, before which the petitioners &s;hould be ordered to de|clare
whether they intended to controvert the la&s;t election
of all the &s;ixteen peers, or the election of any, and which
of them. This affair was of &s;uch an unprecedented nature,
that the Hou&s;e &s;eemed to be divided in opinion about the
manner in which they ought to proceed. The parti&s;ans
of the mini&s;try would have willingly &s;tifled the enquiry in
the beginning; but the petitioners were &s;o &s;tr$nuou&s;ly
&s;upported in their claim to &s;ome notice, by the Earls of
Che&s;terfield, Abingdon, and Strafford, the Lords Bathur&s;t
and Carteret, that they could not di&s;mi&s;s it at once with
any regard to decorum. The order of the Hou&s;e, accord|ing
to the motion explained above, being communicated by
the Lord-Chancellor to the petitioners, they waited on
him with a declaration, importing, that they did not intend
to controvert the election or return of the &s;ixteen peers for
Scotland; but they thought it their duty to lay before their
lord&s;hips the evidance of &s;uch facts and undue methods as
appeared to them to be dangerous to the con&s;titution; and
might in future elections equally affect the right of the
pre&s;ent &s;ixteen peers, as that of the other peers of Scot|land,
if not prevented by a proper remedy. This decla|ration
being repeated to the Hou&s;e, the Duke of Devon|&s;hire
made a motion, that the petitioners might be ordered
to lay before the Hou&s;e in writing in&s;tances of tho&s;e undue
methods and illegal practices upon which they intended
to proceed, and the names of the per&s;ons they &s;u&s;pected to
be guilty. He was warmly oppo&s;ed by the country party;
and a long debate en&s;ued, after which the que&s;tion was
carried in favour of the motion, and the order &s;ignified to
the petitioners. Next day their an&s;wer was read to the
Hou&s;e to this effect: That as they had no intention to
&s;tate them&s;elves accu&s;ers, they could not take upon them
<PB N="506" REF="512">
to name particular per&s;ons who might have been concerned
in tho&s;e illegal practices; but who they were would un|doubtedly
appear to their lord&s;hips upon their taking the
proper examinations; neverthele&s;s, they did humbly ac|quaint
their lord&s;hips, that the petition was laid before
them upon information that the li&s;t of the &s;ixteen peers
for Scotland had been framed previous to the election, by
per&s;ons in high tru&s;t under the crown: that this li&s;t was
&s;hown to peers, as a li&s;t approved by the crown;
and was called the King's li&s;t, from which there was to be
no variation, unle&s;s to make way for one or two particular
peers, on condition they &s;hould conform to mea&s;ures:
that peers were &s;ollicited to vote for this li&s;t, without the
liberty of making any alteration: that endeavours were
u&s;ed to engage peers to vote for this li&s;t by promi&s;e of
pen&s;ions, and offices civil and military to them&s;elves and
relations, as well as by offers of money: that &s;ums were
given for this purpo&s;e: that pen&s;ions, offices, and relea&s;es
of debts owing to the crown were actually granted to
peers who concurred in voting for this li&s;t, and to their
relations: that on the day of election a battalion of his
Maje&s;ty's troops was drawn up in the abbey-court of Edin|burgh,
contrary to cu&s;tom, and without any apparent cau&s;e
but that of overawing the electors. This an&s;wer gave ri&s;e
to another violent di&s;pute; but the majority voted it un&s;a|tisfactory,
and the petition was rejected, though the re&s;o|lution
was clogged with a vigorous prote&s;t.</P>
<P>&sect; XXV. Notwith&s;tanding this di&s;couragement,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1735.</NOTE> the Earl
of Abingdon moved, That although the petition was di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed,
an enquiry might be &s;et on foot touching an af|fair
of &s;uch con&s;equence to the liberties of the kingdom.
The Earl of Ilay declaring his belief, that no &s;uch illegal
methods had been practi&s;ed, the other produced a pamphlet,
intituled, The prote&s;ts of a great number of noble lords,
entered by them at the la&s;t election of peers for Scotland.
Exceptions being taken to a pamphlet, as an object un|worthy
of their notice, Lord Bathur&s;t exhibited an authen|tick
copy of tho&s;e prote&s;ts, extracted from the journal of that
election, &s;igned by the two principal clerks, and witne&s;&s;ed
<PB N="507" REF="513">
by two gentlemen then attending in the lobby.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. V. 1735.</NOTE> The&s;e
were accordingly read, and plainly demon&s;trated the truth
of the allegations contained in the petition. Nothing
could be more &s;candalous, arrogant, and &s;hamefully
flagrant than the conduct and deportment of tho&s;e who
acted the part of under&s;trappers to the mini&s;try on this
occa&s;ion. But all this demon&s;tration, adorned and en|forced
by the charms and energy of eloquence, was like
preaching in a de&s;ert. A motion was made for adjourning,
and carried in the a$$irmative: a prote&s;t was entered, and
the whole affair con&s;igned to oblivion. Divers other
motions were made &s;ucce&s;&s;ively by the lords in the oppo|&s;ition,
and rejected by the invincible power of a majority.
The uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;s of the mini&s;try did not, how|ever,
prevent them from renewing the &s;truggle as often as
an opportunity offered. They di&s;puted the continuation
of the &s;alt-tax, and the bill for enabling the King to apply
the &s;um of one million out of the &s;inking fund for the
&s;ervice of the current year, though &s;ucce&s;s did not attend
their endeavours. They &s;upported with all their might
a bill &s;ent up from the Commons, explaining and amend|ing
an act of the Scotti&s;h parliament, for preventing
wronguous impri&s;onment, and again&s;t undue delays in
trials. This was all the natives of Scotland had in lieu
of the Habeas Corpus act; though it did not &s;creen them
from oppre&s;&s;ion. Yet the Earl of Ilay undertook to prove
they were on a &s;ooting with their neighbours of England
in this re&s;pect; and the bill was thrown out on a divi&s;ion.
The &s;e&s;&s;ion was clo&s;ed on the fifteenth of May, when the
King, in his &s;peech to both Hou&s;es declared, that the plan
of pacification concerted between him and the States-Ge|neral
had not produced the de&s;ired effect. He thanked the
Commons for the &s;upplies they had granted with &s;uch
chearfulne&s;s and di&s;patch. He &s;ignified his intention to
vi&s;it his German dominions; and told them he &s;hould
con&s;titute the Queen regent of the realm in his ab&s;ence.
Immediately after the prorogation his Maje&s;ty embarked
for Holland, in his way to Hanover.</P>
<P><PB N="508" REF="514">
&sect; XXVI. By this time the good under&s;tanding between
the courts of Madrid and Li&s;bon was de&s;troyed by a re|markable
incident.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1735.</NOTE> The Portugue&s;e amba&s;&s;ador at Ma|drid
having allowed his &s;ervants to re&s;cue a criminal from
the officers of ju&s;tice, all the &s;ervants concerned in that
re&s;cue were dragged from his hou&s;e to pri&s;on, by the Spani&s;h
King's order, with circum&s;tances of rigour and di&s;grace.
His Portugue&s;e Maje&s;ty being informed of this outrage,
ordered repri&s;als to be made upon the &s;ervants of the Spa|ni&s;h
amba&s;&s;adour in Li&s;bon. The two mini&s;ters withdrew
abruptly to their re&s;pective courts. The two mo|narchs
expre&s;&s;ed their mutual re&s;entment. The King
of Spain a&s;&s;embled a body of troops on the frontiers of
Portugal; and his Portugue&s;e Maje&s;ty had recour&s;e to the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of King George. Don Marcos Antonio d'Alze|veda
was di&s;patched to London, with the character of envoy
extraordinary; and &s;ucceeded in his commi&s;&s;ion according
to his wi&s;h. In a little time after the King's departure
from England, Sir John Norris &s;ailed from Spithead with
a powerful &s;quadron, in order to protect the Portugue&s;e
again&s;t the Spaniards; and on the ninth day of June ar|rived
at Li&s;bon, where he was welcomed as a deliverer.
Mr. Keene, the Briti&s;h envoy at the court of Spain, had
communicated to his Catholick Maje&s;ty the re&s;olution of
his ma&s;ter to &s;end a powerful &s;quadron to Li&s;bon, with
orders to guard that coa&s;t from in&s;ults, and &s;ecure the
Brazil fleet, in which the merchants of Great-Britain were
deeply intere&s;ted. Don Jo&s;eph Patinho, mini&s;ter of his
Catholick Maje&s;ty, delivered a memorial to Mr. Keene,
repre&s;enting, that &s;uch an expedition would affect the
commerce of Spain, by intimidating foreign merchants
from embarking their merchandi&s;e in the &s;lota. But, in
all probability, it prevented a rupture between the two
crowns, and di&s;po&s;ed the King of Spain to li&s;ten to terms
of accommodation.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVII. The powers in alliance again&s;t the Hou&s;e of
Au&s;tria having rejected the plan of pacification concerted
by the King of Great-Britain and the States-General,
<PB N="509" REF="515">
Mr. Walpole, amba&s;&s;ador at the Hague, pre&s;ented a memo|rial
to their high mightine&s;&s;es, de&s;iring they would, without
lo&s;s of time, put them&s;elves in a po&s;ture of defence, by an
augmentation of their forces at &s;ea and land, that they
might take &s;uch vigorous &s;teps, in concert with Great-Britain,
as the future conjuncture of affairs might require.
But, before they would &s;ubject them&s;elves to &s;uch expen&s;e,
they re&s;olved to make further trial of their influence
with the powers in alliance again&s;t the Emperor; and con|ferences
were renewed with the mini&s;ters of tho&s;e allies.
The affairs of Poland became more and more unfavourable
to the intere&s;t of Stani&s;laus; for though a great number
of the Poli&s;h nobility engaged in a confederacy to &s;upport
his claim, and made repeated efforts in his behalf, the
Palatine of Kiow &s;ubmitted to Augu&s;tus; and even his
brother the primate, after having &s;u&s;tained a long impri|&s;onment,
and many extraordinary hard&s;hips, was obliged
to acknowledge that prince his &s;overeign. In Italy the
arms of the allies &s;till continued to pro&s;per. Don Carlos
landed in Sicily, and reduced the whole i&s;land, almo&s;t
without oppo&s;ition; while the Imperiali&s;ts were forced to
abandon all the territories they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in Italy, except
the Mantuan. The Emperor being equally unable to cope
with the French armies on the Rhine, implored &s;uccours
of the Czarina, who &s;ent thirty thou&s;and men to his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance.
This vigorous interpo&s;ition, and the &s;ucce&s;s of
Augu&s;tus in Poland, di&s;po&s;ed the court of Ver&s;ailles to a
pacification. A &s;ecret negociation was begun between
France and the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria; and the preliminaries
were &s;igned without the conc$rrence or knowledge of
Spain, Sardinia, and the maritime powers. In the&s;e arti|cles
it was &s;tipulated, That France &s;hould re&s;tore all the
conque&s;ts &s;he had made in Germany: That the rever&s;ion
of the dukedom of Tu&s;cany &s;hould be ve&s;ted in the Duke
of Lorraine: Th$$ Lorraine &s;hould be allotted to King
Stani&s;laus; and after his death be united to the crown of
France: That the Emperor &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s the Milane&s;e,
the Mantuan, and Parma: That the King of Sardinia
<PB N="510" REF="516">
&s;hould enjoy Vigevano and Novara: That Don Carlos
&s;hould be acknowledged King of Naples and Sicily, and
retain the i&s;land of Elba, with all the Spani&s;h territories on
the coa&s;t of Tu&s;cany; and that France &s;hould guarantee
the pragmatick &s;anction.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVIII. The King of Great-Britain returned from
Hanover to England in the month of November; and on
the fifteenth day of January opened the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parlia|ment.
On this occa&s;ion he congratulated them on the
near pro&s;pect of a general peace in Europe, in con&s;equence
of the preliminary articles to which the Emperor and the
King of France had agreed; and of which he had ex|pre&s;&s;ed
his approbation, as they did not differ in any
e&s;&s;ential point from the plan of pacification which he and
the States-General had offered to the belligerent powers.
He told them that he had already ordered a con&s;iderable
reduction to be made in his forces both by &s;ea and land;
but at the &s;ame time ob&s;erved it would be nece&s;&s;ary to
continue &s;ome extraordinary expen&s;e, until a more perfect
reconciliation &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed among the &s;everal
powers of Europe. An addre&s;s of thanks was unani|mou&s;ly
voted, pre&s;ented, and graciou&s;ly received. After
the Hou&s;e had received &s;everal petitions from different
counties and gentlemen, complaining of undue influence
in elections for members of parliament, it proceeded to
con&s;ider of the &s;upply, and Sir Charles Wager moving
that fifteen thou&s;and &s;eamen &s;hould be employed for the
&s;ervice of the en&s;uing year, the propo&s;al was approved
without oppo&s;ition. But this was not the ca&s;e with a
motion made by Mr. Pulteney, &startq;That the ordinary e&s;ti|mate
of the navy &s;hould be referred to a &s;elect com|mittee.&endq;
The mini&s;try di&s;couraged all &s;uch prying
mea&s;ures: a debate was produced, the Hou&s;e divided, and
the motion was rejected. Such was the fate of a motion
for rai&s;ing the &s;upplies within the year, made by Mr.
Sandys, and &s;upported by Sir John Barnard, Mr. Willi|mot,
and other patriots, who demon&s;trated, that this was
a &s;peedy and practicable expedient for di&s;charging the
<PB N="511" REF="517">
national debt, lowering the intere&s;t of money, reducing
the price of labour, and encouraging a &s;pirit of com|merce.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIX. The bill for limiting the number of officers in
the Hou&s;e of Commons was again revived. The King
was empowered to borrow &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds,
chargeable on the &s;inking fund, for the &s;ervice of the en|&s;uing
year, though this power was not ea&s;ily granted; and
the Hou&s;e re&s;olved to lay a duty of twenty &s;hillings per
gallon on all &s;pirituous liquors, after it had appeared to
the committee appointed for that purpo&s;e that tho&s;e &s;pirits
were pernicious to the health and morals of the people.
To this re&s;olution was added another, which amounted to
a total prohibition, namely, that fifty pounds &s;hould be
yearly paid to his Maje&s;ty for a licen&s;e to be annually
taken out by every per&s;on who &s;hould vend, barter, or
utter any &s;uch &s;pirituous liquors. Mr. Walter Plumer,
in $span$ concerted &s;peech, moved for the repeal of &s;ome
cla$$es in the te&s;t act: the&s;e he repre&s;ented as a &s;pecies of
per&s;ecution in which prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters were confounded
with the Roman catholicks and enemies to the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment.
He was &s;u&s;tained by Lord Polwarth and Mr.
Heathcote; but Sir Robert Walpole was joined by Mr.
Shippen again&s;t the motion as dangerous to the e&s;tabli&s;hed
church: and the que&s;tion being put, it was carried in the
negative.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1736.</NOTE> When Sir Jo&s;eph Jekyll pre&s;ented to the Hou&s;e,
according to order, a bill founded on the re&s;olutions they
had taken again&s;t &s;pirituous liquors, Sir Robert Walpole
acquainted them, by his Maje&s;ty's command, that as the
alterations propo&s;ed to be made by that bill in the duties
charged upon all &s;pirituous liquors might in a great degree
affect &s;ome part of the civil-li&s;t revenues, his Maje&s;ty, for
the &s;ake of remedying &s;o great an evil as was intended by
that bill to be prevented, did con&s;ent to accept any other
revenue of equal value, to be &s;ettled and appropriated in
lieu of his intere&s;t in the &s;aid duties. The bill was read a
&s;econd time, and con&s;igned to a committee of the whole
Hou&s;e; but that for limiting the number of officers in the
<PB N="512" REF="518">
Hou&s;e of Commons was thrown out at the &s;econd read|ing.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1736.</NOTE>
Petitions again&s;t the bill touching the retail of &s;pi|rituous
liquors were pre&s;ented by the traders to the Briti&s;h
&s;ugar colonies, by the merchants of Bri&s;tol and Liverpool,
repre&s;enting the hard&s;hips to which they would be expo&s;ed
by a law which amounted to a prohibition of rum and &s;pi|rits
di&s;tilled from mela&s;&s;es. In con&s;equence of the&s;e re|mon&s;trances,
a mitigating clau&s;e was in&s;erted, in favour
of the compo&s;ition known by the name of punch; and
di&s;tillers were permitted to exerci&s;e any other employment.
The &s;um of &s;eventy thou&s;and pounds was voted for making
good the deficiencies that might happen in the civil-li&s;t by
this bill, which at length pa&s;&s;ed through the Hou&s;e, though
not without reiterated di&s;putes and warm altercation.
Violent oppo&s;ition was likewi&s;e made to a bill for the re|lief
of the people called quakers, who offered a petition,
repre&s;enting, that though from motives of con&s;cience they
refu&s;ed the payment of tithes, church-rates, oblations, and
eccle&s;ia&s;tical dues, they were expo&s;ed to grievous &s;ufferings
by pro&s;ecution in the Exchequer, eccele&s;ia&s;tical, and other
courts, to the impri&s;onment of their per&s;ons, and the
ruin of them and their families. A bill being prepared
for their relief, was read and printed: then petitions were
preferred again&s;t it by the clergy of Middle&s;ex, and of
many other parts of the kingdom. Coun&s;el was heard in
behalf of the&s;e petitioners, and &s;everal alterations propo&s;ed
in the bill, which after long repeated debates &s;urmounted
all oppo&s;ition, and was &s;ent up to the lords.</P>
<P>&sect; XXX. In the month of February the King had &s;ent
two members of the privy-council to the Prince of Wales,
with a me&s;&s;age, propo&s;ing a marriage between his royal
highne&s;s and the Prince&s;s of Saxegotha. The propo&s;al
being agreeable to the Prince, the marriage was celebrated
on the twenty-&s;eventh day of April. Upon this occa&s;ion
Mr. Pulteney moved for an addre&s;s of congratulation to
his Maje&s;ty, and was &s;upported by Mr. George Lyttelton
and Mr. William Pitt, who &s;ei&s;ed this opportunity of
<PB N="513" REF="519">
pronouncing elegant panegyricks on the Prince of Wales
and his amiable con&s;ort.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. V. 1736.</NOTE> The&s;e two young members &s;oon
di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in the Hou&s;e by their eloquence
and &s;uperior talents. The attention of the Hou&s;e was
afterwards converted to a bill for the preventing of &s;mug|gling;
and another for explaining the act for the more
effectual preventing bribery and corruption in the election of
members to &s;erve in parliament. Both made their way
through the Lower Hou&s;e, and were &s;ent up to the Lords for
their concurrence. The number of land-forces voted for the
&s;ervice of the current year was reduced to &s;eventeen thou&s;and
&s;even hundred and four effective men. The &s;upplies were
rai&s;ed by the malt-tax and land-tax, at two &s;hillings in the
pound, additional duties on mum, cyder, and perry, &s;tamped
vellum, parchment, and paper; and by an act empowering
his Maje&s;ty to borrow &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds of the
&s;inking fund. In this &s;e&s;&s;ion the parliament repealed the old
&s;tatutes of England and Scotland again&s;t conjuration,
witchcraft, and dealing with evil &s;pirits. The Commons
likewi&s;e prepared a bill to re&s;train the di&s;po&s;ition of lands in
mortmain, whereby they became unalienable. Again&s;t this
mea&s;ure petitions were pre&s;ented by the two univer&s;ities,
the colleges of Eton, Winche&s;ter, and We&s;tmin&s;ter, and
divers ho&s;pitals that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted by charitable donations. In
favour of the univer&s;ities and colleges a particular exempt|ing
clau&s;e was in&s;erted. Several other amendments were
made in the bill, which pa&s;&s;ed through both Hou&s;es, and
obtained the royal a&s;&s;ent. Among the acts pa&s;&s;ed in this
&s;e&s;&s;ion, was one for naturali&s;ing her Royal Highne&s;s the
Prince&s;s of Wales; and another for building a bridge
acro&s;s the Thames from New-Palace-yard, in the city
of We&s;tmin&s;ter, to the oppo&s;ite &s;hore in the county of
Surrey. The points chiefly debated in the Hou&s;e of Lords
were the addre&s;s of thanks for his Maje&s;ty's &s;peech, the
mortmain bill, the Quakers bill, which was thrown out,
and that for the prevention of &s;muggling, which did not
pa&s;s without divi&s;ion and prote&s;t. On the twentieth day
of May the King clo&s;ed the &s;e&s;&s;ion with a &s;peech, in which
<PB N="514" REF="520">
he told both Hou&s;es that a further convention touching the
execution of the preliminaries had been made and commu|nicated
to him by the Emperor and Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King:
and that negociations were carrying on by the &s;everal powers
engaged in the late war, in order to &s;ettle a general pacifi|cation.
He expre&s;&s;ed great concern at &s;eeing &s;uch deeds
of di&s;&s;atisfaction &s;own among his people: he prote&s;ted it
was his de&s;ire, and &s;hould be his care, to pre&s;erve the pre|&s;ent
con&s;titution in church and &s;tate, as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed:
he recommended harmony and mutual affection among
all prote&s;tants of the nation, as the great &s;ecurity of that
happy e&s;tabli&s;hment; and &s;ignified his intention to vi&s;it
his German dominions. Accordingly, the parliament was
no &s;ooner prorogued than he &s;et out for Hanover, after
having appointed the Queen regent in his ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXI. Such a degree of licentiou&s;ne&s;s prevailed over
the whole nation, that the kingdom was filled with tumult
and riots, which might have been prevented by proper
regulations of the civil government in a due execution of
the laws. The mo&s;t remarkable of the&s;e di&s;turbances
happened at Edinburgh, on the &s;eventh day of September.
John Porteous, who commanded the guard paid by that
city, a man of brutal di&s;po&s;ition and abandoned morals,
had at the execution of a &s;muggler been provoked by &s;ome
in&s;ults from the populace to order his men, without u&s;ing
the previous formalities of the law, to fire with &s;hot among
the crowd; by which precipitate order &s;everal innocent per|&s;ons
lo&s;t their lives. Porteous was tried for murther, con|victed,
and received &s;entence of death; but the Queen, as
guardian of the realm, thought proper to indulge him
with a reprieve. The common people of Edinburgh re|&s;ented
this lenity &s;hown to a criminal who was the object
of their dete&s;tation. They remembered that pardons had
been granted to divers military delinquents in that country,
who had been condemned by legal trial. They &s;eemed
to think tho&s;e were encouragements to oppre&s;&s;ion: they
were fired by a national jealou&s;y: they were &s;timulated
<PB N="515" REF="521">
by the relations and friends of tho&s;e who had been mur|thered;
and they re&s;olved to wreak their vengeance on the
author of that tragedy, by depriving him of life on the
very day which the judges had fixed for his execution.
Thus determined, they a&s;&s;embled in different bodies, about
ten o'clock at night. They blocked up the gates of
the city, to prevent the admi&s;&s;ion of the troops that were
quartered in the &s;uburbs. They &s;urpri&s;ed and di&s;armed the
town guard: they broke open the pri&s;on doors, dragged
Porteous from thence to the place of execution, and leav|ing
him hanging by the neck on a dyer's pole, quietly
di&s;per&s;ed to their &s;everal habitations. This exploit was
performed with &s;uch conduct and deliberation as &s;eemed
to be the re&s;ult of a plan formed by &s;ome per&s;ons of con&s;e|quence:
it, therefore, became the object of a very &s;evere
enquiry.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXII. During this &s;ummer a rupture happened
between the Turks and Ru&s;&s;ians, which la&s;t reduced
the city of A&s;oph on the Black-Sea, and over-ran the
greate&s;t part of Crim Tartary. The Czarina declared
war again&s;t the Ottoman Porte, becau&s;e the Tartars of the
Crimea had made incur&s;ions upon her frontiers; and when
&s;he complained of the&s;e di&s;orders to the Vizir, &s;he received
no &s;atisfaction: be&s;ides, a large body of Tartars had, by
order of that mini&s;ter, marched through the Ru&s;&s;ian pro|vinces
in de&s;pite of the Empre&s;s, and committed terrible
havock in their route. The Emperor was obliged to en|gage
as a party in this war, by a treaty offen&s;ive and de|fen&s;ive,
which he had many years before concluded with
the Czarina. Yet, before he declared him&s;elf, he joined
the maritime powers in offering his mediation to the Sul|tan,
who was very well di&s;po&s;ed to peace; but the Czarina
in&s;i&s;ted upon her retaining A&s;oph, which her forces had
reduced; and this preliminary article being rejected, as
di&s;honourable to the Ottoman Empire, the court of Vienna
began to make preparations for war. By this time all the
belligerent powers in Italy had agreed to the preliminaries
of peace concluded between the Emperor and France.
<PB N="516" REF="522">
The Duke of Lorraine had e&s;pou&s;ed the Emperor's elde&s;t
daughter, the Archduche&s;s Maria There&s;a, and ceded Lor|raine
to France, even before he &s;ucceeded to Tu&s;cany.
Don Carlos was crowned King of Sicily: Stani$laus abdi|cated
the crown of Poland; and Augu&s;tus was univer&s;ally
acknowledged &s;overeign of that kingdom. The prelimi|naries
were approved and accepted by the diet of the em|pire:
the King of Spain &s;ent orders for his troops to eva|cuate
Tu&s;cany; and the provinces in Italy yielded to the
hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. Prince Eugene, who had managed the
intere&s;ts of the Emperor on this occa&s;ion, did not live to &s;ee
the happy fruits of his negociation. He died at Vienna,
in April, at the age of &s;eventy-three, leaving behind him
the character of an invincible hero and con&s;ummate poli|tician.
He was not long &s;urvived by Count Staremberg,
another Imperial General, who ranked next to the prince
in military reputation. About the &s;ame time Great-Britain
&s;u&s;tained a national lo&s;s in the death of Lord Chancellor
Talbot, who, by his worth, probity, and acquired accom|pli&s;hments,
had dignified the great office to which he had
been rai&s;ed. He died univer&s;ally lamented, in the month
of February, at the age of fifty-two; and was &s;ucceeded
on the bench by Lord Hardwicke.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIII. The King being indi&s;po&s;ed in con&s;equence
of having been fatigued by a very tempe&s;tuous pa&s;&s;age from
Holland, the parliament was prorogued from the twenty-fir&s;t
day of January to the fir&s;t of February, and then the
&s;e&s;&s;ion was opened by commi&s;&s;ion. The Lord Chancellor,
as one of the peers authori&s;ed by this commi&s;&s;ion, made a
&s;peech in his Maje&s;ty's name to both Hou&s;es. With re&s;pect
to foreign affairs, he told them, that the re&s;pective acts of
ce&s;&s;ion being exchanged, and orders given for the evacu|ation
and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;everal countries and places by
the powers concerned, according to the allotment and
di&s;po&s;ition of the preliminary articles, the great work of
re-e&s;tabli&s;hing the general tranquillity was $ar advanced:
that, however, common prudence called upon them to be
very attentive to the final conclu&s;ion of the new &s;ettle|ment.
<PB N="517" REF="523">
He &s;aid his Maje&s;ty could not without &s;urpri&s;e and
concern ob&s;erve the many contrivances and attempts car|ried
on, in various &s;hapes, and in different parts of the na|tion,
tumultuou&s;ly to re&s;i&s;t and ob&s;truct the execution of
the laws, and to violate the peace of the kingdom. He
ob&s;erved, that the con&s;ideration of the height to which
the&s;e audacious practices might ri&s;e, if not timely &s;uppre&s;|&s;ed,
afforded a melancholy pro&s;pect, and required particular
attention, le&s;t they &s;hould affect private per&s;ons in the quiet
enjoyment of their property, as well as the general peace
and good order of the whole. After the Commons had
agreed to an addre&s;s, and heard coun&s;el on &s;ome contro|verted
elections, they proceeded to take the &s;upply into
con&s;ideration. They voted ten thou&s;and men for the &s;ea-&s;ervice.
They continued for the land-&s;ervice the &s;ame num|ber
they had maintained in times of tranquillity, amount|ing
to &s;eventeen thou&s;and &s;even hundred and four; but
this mea&s;ure was not adopted without oppo&s;ition: the mo|ney
was rai&s;ed by the land and malt-taxes, re-enforced with
one million granted out of the &s;inking fund.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIV. The chief &s;ubject of contention that pre|&s;ented
it&s;elf in the cour&s;e of this &s;e&s;&s;ion, was a motion
which Mr. Pulteney made for an addre&s;s to his Maje&s;ty,
that he would be plea&s;ed to &s;ettle one hundred thou&s;and
pounds a-year upon the Prince of Wales. He repre|&s;ented
that &s;uch provi&s;ion was conformable to the practice
of ancient times; that what he propo&s;ed had been enjoyed
by his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty in the life-time of his father; and
that a &s;ettlement of this nature was rea&s;onable and nece&s;&s;ary
to a&s;certain the independency of the apparent heir to the
crown. The motion was vigorou&s;ly oppo&s;ed by Sir Ro|bert
Walpole, as an encroachment on the prerogative; as
an officious intermeddling in the King's family affairs; and
as an effort to &s;et his Maje&s;ty and the Prince at variance.
But a mi&s;under&s;tanding, it &s;eems, had already happened in
the royal family. The mini&s;ter in the mid&s;t of his ha|rangue
told the Hou&s;e, by his Maje&s;ty's command, that on
the preceding day the King had &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the
<PB N="518" REF="524">
Prince by &s;everal noblemen of the fir&s;t quality, importing,
that his Maje&s;ty had given order for &s;ettling a jointure up|on
the Prince&s;s of Wales, &s;uitable to her high rank and
dignity, which he would in a proper time lay before
parliament, in order to be rendered more certain and ef|fectual;
that although his royal highne&s;s had not thought
&s;it, by any application to his Maje&s;ty, to de&s;ire that his
allowance of fifty thou&s;and pounds might be rendered le&s;s
precarious, the King, to prevent the bad con&s;equences
which he apprehended might follow from the undutiful
mea&s;ures which his Maje&s;ty was informed the Prince had
been advi&s;ed to pur&s;ue, would grant to his royal highne&s;s,
for his Maje&s;ty's life, the &s;aid fifty thou&s;and pounds per
annum, to be i&s;&s;ued out of the civil-li&s;t revenues, over
and above the Prince's revenues ari&s;ing from the duchy of
Cornwall, which his Maje&s;ty thought a very competent
allowance, con&s;idering his own numerous i&s;&s;ue, and the
great expen&s;e which did and mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily attend an
honourable provi&s;ion for the whole royal family; that the
Prince, by a verbal an&s;wer, de&s;ired their lord&s;hips to lay
him with all humility at his Maje&s;ty's feet; to a&s;&s;ure him
that he did, and ever &s;hould retain the utmo&s;t duty for his
royal per&s;on; that he was very thankful for any in&s;tance
of his Maje&s;ty's goodne&s;s to him or to the Prince&s;s, and
particularly for his Maje&s;ty's gracious intention of &s;ettling a
jointure upon her royal highne&s;s; but, that as to the me&s;&s;age,
the affair was now out of his hands, and, therefore, he
could give no an&s;wer to it; that his royal highne&s;s after|wards
u&s;ed many dutiful expre&s;&s;ions towards his Maje&s;ty;
adding, &startq;Indeed, my lords, it is in other hands, and I am
&s;orry for it;&endq; or words to that effect. Sir Robert
Walpole then endeavoured to demon&s;trate, that the annual
&s;um of fifty thou&s;and pounds was as much as the King
could afford to allow for the Prince's maintenance; and he
expatiated upon the bad con&s;equences that might en&s;ue,
if the &s;on &s;hould be rendered altogether independent of the
father.</P>
<P><PB N="519" REF="525">
&sect; XXXV. The&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions did not pa&s;s unan&s;wered.
Sir Robert Walpole had a&s;&s;erted, that the parliament had
no right to interfere in the creation or maintenance of a
Prince of Wales; and that in the ca&s;e of Richard II.
who, upon the death of his father the Black Prince, was
created Prince of Wales, in con&s;equence of an addre&s;s
or petition from parliament, that mea&s;ure was in all pro|bability
directed by the King him&s;elf. In an&s;wer to this
a&s;&s;ertion it was ob&s;erved, that probably the King would
not have been &s;o $orward in creating his grand&s;on Prince
of Wales, if he had not been forced into this &s;tep by his
parliament; for Edward in his old age fell into a &s;ort of
love-dotage, and gave him&s;elf entirely up to the manage|ment
of his mi&s;tre&s;s, Alice Pierce, and his &s;econd &s;on, the
Duke of Lanca&s;ter; a circum&s;tance that rai&s;ed a mo&s;t rea|&s;onable
jealou&s;y in the Black Prince, at that time on his
death bed, who could not but be anxious about the &s;afety
and right of his only &s;on, whom he found he was &s;oon to
leave a child in the hands of a doating grandfather, and
an ambitious, a&s;piring uncle. The &s;upporters of the moti|on
ob&s;erved, that the allowance of fifty thou&s;and pounds
was not &s;ufficient to defray the Prince's yearly expen&s;e,
without allotting one &s;hilling for acts of charity and muni|ficence;
and that the &s;everal deductions for land-taxes and
fees reduced it to forty-three thou&s;and pounds. They
affirmed, that his whole income, including the revenues of
the duchy of Cornwall, did not exceed fifty-two thou&s;and
pounds a-year, though, by his Maje&s;ty's own regulation,
the expen&s;e of the Prince's hou&s;ehold amounted to &s;ixty-three
thou&s;and. They proved, that the produce of the
civil-li&s;t exceeded nine hundred thou&s;and pounds, a &s;um
above one hundred thou&s;and pounds a-year more than was
enjoyed by his late Maje&s;ty; and that in the fir&s;t year of
the late King the whole expen&s;e of his hou&s;ehold and
civil government did not much exceed four hundred and
fifty thou&s;and pounds a-year. They ob&s;erved, that the
parliament added one hundred and forty thou&s;and pounds
annually for acts of charity and bounty, together with
<PB N="520" REF="526">
the article of &s;ecret &s;ervice money; and allowed one hun|dred
thou&s;and pounds for the maintenance of the Prince
of Wales: that the article of &s;ecret &s;ervice money had
prodigiou&s;ly increa&s;ed in the late reign: by an account
which happened to be laid before the parliament, it appear|ed
that va&s;t &s;ums of money had been given for purpo&s;es
which nobody under&s;tood, and to per&s;ons whom nobody
knew. In the beginning of the following &s;e&s;&s;ion &s;everal
members propo&s;ed that this extraordinary account &s;hould
be taken into con&s;ideration; but the enquiry was warded
off by the other party, who declared that the parliament
could not examine any account which had been pre&s;ented
to a former &s;e&s;&s;ion. The debate was fierce and long;
and ended in a divi&s;ion, by which the motion was rejected.
A motion of the &s;ame nature was made by Lord Carteret
in the Hou&s;e of Peers, and gave ri&s;e to a very keen di&s;pute,
maintained by the &s;ame arguments, and i&s;&s;uing in the &s;ame
termination.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVI. The next remarkable conte&s;t was occa&s;ion|ed
by a motion of Sir R. Walpole, who propo&s;ed that the
&s;um of one million &s;hould be granted to his Maje&s;ty, to|wards
redeeming the like &s;um of the increa&s;ed capital of
the South-Sea company, commonly called South-Sea
annuities. Several members argued for the expediency of
applying this &s;um to the payment of the debt due to the
Bank, as part of that incumbrance was &s;addled with
an intere&s;t of &s;ix per cent. whereas the intere&s;t paid for
the other &s;ums that con&s;tituted the publick debt did not
exceed four per cent. Many plau&s;ible arguments were
offered on both &s;ides of the que&s;tion; and at length the
motion was carried in the affirmative. The Hou&s;e having
re&s;olved it&s;elf into a committee to con&s;ider of the national
debt, Sir John Barnard made a motion, for enabling his
Maje&s;ty to rai&s;e money either by the &s;ale of annuities, or
by borrowing at an intere&s;t not exceeding three per
cent. to be applied towards redeeming the South-Sea
annuities; and that &s;uch of the &s;aid annuitants as &s;hould
be inclined to &s;ub&s;cribe their re&s;pective annuities, &s;hould
<PB N="521" REF="527">
be preferred to all others. He &s;aid, that even tho&s;e publick
&s;ecurities which bore an intere&s;t of three per cent. only
were &s;old at a premium in Change-Alley: he was, there|fore,
per&s;uaded, that all tho&s;e who were willing to give a
premium for a three per cent. &s;ecurity would gladly lend
their money to the government at the &s;ame intere&s;t, &s;hould
books of &s;ub&s;cription be opened for that purpo&s;e, with an
a&s;&s;urance that no part of the principal &s;hould be paid off
for fourteen years. He expatiated upon the national ad|vantages
that would accrue from a reduction of intere&s;t.
From ea&s;y and obvious calculations he inferred, that in
a very little time the intere&s;t upon all the South-Sea
annuities would be reduced from four to three per cent.
without any danger to publick credit, or breach of pub|lick
faith: that then the produce of the &s;inking $und would
amount to fourteen hundred thou&s;and pounds per annum,
to be applied only towards redeeming the capital of the
&s;everal trading companies: he proved that this mea&s;ure
would bring every one of them &s;o much within the power
of parliament, that they would be glad to accept of three
per cent. intere&s;t on any rea&s;onable terms; in which ca&s;e
the &s;inking fund would ri&s;e to one million &s;ix hundred
thou&s;and pounds per annum. Then the parliament might
venture to annihilate one half of it, by freeing the people
from the taxes upon coals, candles, &s;oap, leather, and
other &s;uch impo&s;itions as lay heavy upon the poor labour|ers
and manufacturers: the remaining part of the &s;inking
fund might be applied towards the di&s;charge of tho&s;e
annuities and publick debts which bore an intere&s;t of
three per cent. only, and afterwards towards dimini&s;hing
the capitals of the &s;everal trading companies till the term
of fourteen years &s;hould be expired; then the &s;inking fund
would again amount to above a million yearly, which
would be &s;ufficient for paying them off, and freeing the
nation entirely from all its incumbrances. This &s;alutary
&s;cheme was violently oppo&s;ed by Alderman Heathcote,
and other parti&s;ans of the mini&s;try; yet all their objections
were refuted; and, in order to defeat the project, they
were obliged to have recour&s;e to artifice. Mr. Winning|ton,
<PB N="522" REF="528">
moved, that all the publick creditors, as well as the
South Sea annuitants, &s;hould be comprehended. Sir John
Barnard demon&s;trated, that it might be ea&s;y for the govern|ment
to borrow money at three per cent. &s;ufficient for pay|ing
off &s;uch of the proprietors of four-and-twenty millions
as were not willing to accept of that intere&s;t, but it would be
extremely difficult to borrow enough to &s;atisfy the proprietors
of four-and-forty millions, who might choo&s;e to have their
principal rather than &s;uch an intere&s;t. Neverthele&s;s, re&s;o|lutions
were founded on this and other alterations of the
original &s;cheme; and a bill was immediately prepared. It
produced many other debates, and was at la&s;t po&s;tponed by
dint of mini&s;terial influence. The &s;ame venerable patriot
who projected this &s;cheme moved, that as &s;oon as the inte|re&s;t
of all the national redeemable debt &s;hould be reduced to
three per cent. the Hou&s;e would take off &s;ome of the heavy
taxes which oppre&s;&s;ed the poor and the manufacturers;
but this motion was rejected by the majority.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVII.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1737.</NOTE> The la&s;t di&s;putes of this &s;e&s;&s;ion were ex|cited
by a bill &s;ent down from the Lords for puni&s;hing the
magi&s;trates and city of Edinburgh, on account of the
murder of John Porteous. In the beginning of the &s;e&s;&s;ion
Lord Carteret recapitulated the &s;everal tumults and riots
which had lately happened in different parts of the king|dom.
He particularly in&s;i&s;ted upon the atrocious murder
of Captain Porteous, as a flagrant in&s;ult upon the govern|ment,
and a violation of the publick peace, &s;o much the
more dangerous, as it &s;eemed to have been concerted and
executed with deliberation and decency. He &s;u&s;pected
that &s;ome citizens of Edinburgh had been concerned in
the murder, not only from this circum&s;tance, but like|wi&s;e
becau&s;e, notwith&s;tanding the reward of two hundred
pounds, which had been offered by proclamation for the
di&s;covery of any per&s;on who acted in that tragedy, not one
individual had as yet been detected. He &s;eemed to think
that the magi&s;trates had encouraged the riot, and that
the city had forfeited its charter; and he propo&s;ed a mi|nute
enquiry into the particulars of the affair. He was
&s;econded by the Duke of Newca&s;tle and the Earl of $ay;
<PB N="523" REF="529">
though this la&s;t nobleman differed in opinion from him
with re&s;pect to the charter of the city,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. V. 1737.</NOTE> which, he &s;aid,
could not be ju&s;tly forfeited by the fault of the magi&s;tracy.
The Lords re&s;olved, That the magi&s;trates and other per|&s;ons
from whom they might obtain the nece&s;&s;ary in|formation
concerning this riot &s;hould be ordered to attend;
and, That an addre&s;s &s;hould be pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty,
de&s;iring that the different accounts and papers relating
to the murther of Captain Porteous might be &s;ubmitted
to the peru&s;al of the Hou&s;e. The&s;e documents being
accordingly examined, and all the witne&s;&s;es arrived, in|cluding
three Scotti&s;h judges, a debate aro&s;e about the
manner in which the&s;e la&s;t &s;hould be interrogated, whether
at the bar, at the table, or on the wool&s;acks. Some
Scotti&s;h lords a&s;&s;erted, that they had a right to be &s;eated
next to the judges of England: but after a long debate
this claim was rejected, and the judges of Scotland appeared
at the bar in their robes. A bill was brought in to di&s;able
Alexander Wil&s;on, E&s;quire, lord-provo&s;t of Edinburgh,
from enjoying any office or place of magi&s;tracy in the city
of Edinburgh, or el&s;ewhere in Great-Britain; for im|pri&s;oning
the &s;aid Alexander Wil&s;on; for aboli&s;hing the
guard of that city; and for taking away the gates of the
Nether-Bow-Port, &s;o as to open a communication between
the city and the &s;uburbs, in which the King's troops are
quartered. The Duke of Argyle, in arguing again&s;t this
bill, &s;aid he could not think of a proceeding more har&s;h or
unprecedented than the pre&s;ent, as he believed there was
no in&s;tance of the whole weight of parliamentary indig|nation,
for &s;uch he called a proceeding by a bill <HI>ex po&s;t
facto,</HI> falling upon any &s;ingle per&s;on, far le&s;s upon any
community, for crimes that were within the reach of the
inferior courts of ju&s;tice: for this rea&s;on he ob&s;erved,
that if the Lord-Provo&s;t and citizens of Edinburgh &s;hould
&s;uffer in the terms of the pre&s;ent bill, they would &s;uffer by
a cruel, unju&s;t, and fanta&s;tical proceeding; a proceeding of
which the wor&s;t u&s;e might be made, if ever the nation
&s;hould have the misfortune to $all under a partial, &s;elf-intere&s;ted
<PB N="524" REF="530">
intere&s;ted admini&s;tration.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1737.</NOTE> He told them he &s;at in the
parliament of Scotland when that part of the treaty of
Union relating to the privileges of the royal burghs was
&s;ettled on the &s;ame footing as religion, that is, they
were made unalterable by any &s;ub&s;equent parliament of
Great-Britain. Notwith&s;tanding the eloquence and
warmth of his remon&s;trance, the bill was &s;ent down to
the Hou&s;e of Commons, where it produced a violent con|te&s;t.
The Commons &s;et on foot a &s;evere &s;crutiny into
the particular circum&s;tances that preceded and attended
the murther of Porteous: from the examination of the
evidences it appeared that no freeman or citizen of Edin|burgh
was concerned in the riot, which was chiefly com|po&s;ed
of country-people, excited by the relations of &s;ome
unhappy per&s;ons whom Porteous and his men had &s;lain at
the execution of the &s;muggler; and the&s;e were a&s;&s;i&s;ted by
prentice boys, and the lowe&s;t cla&s;s of vagabonds that hap|pened
to be at Edinburgh: that the Lord-Provo&s;t had
taken all the precautions to prevent mi&s;chief that his re|flexion
&s;ugge&s;ted: that he even expo&s;ed his per&s;on to the
rage of the multitude, in his endeavours to di&s;per&s;e them;
and, that if he had done ami&s;s, he erred from want of
judgement, rather than from want of inclination to pro|tect
the unhappy Porteous. It likewi&s;e appeared, that Mr.
Lind&s;ay, member for the city of Edinburgh, had gone in
per&s;on to General Moyle, commander of the forces in
North-Britain, informed him of the riot, implored his
immediate a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and promi&s;ed to conduct his troops
into the city; and that his &s;uit was rejected, becau&s;e he
could not produce a written order from the magi&s;tracy,
which he neither could have obtained in &s;uch confu&s;ion,
nor ventured to carry about his per&s;on through the mid&s;t
of an enraged populace. The Scotti&s;h members exerted
them&s;elves with uncommon vivacity in defence of their
capital. They were joined by Sir John Barnard, Lord
Cornbury, Mr. Shippen, and Mr. Oglethorpe. Lord
Polwarth declared, that if any gentleman would &s;how where
one argument in the charge again&s;t the Lord-Provo&s;t and the
<PB N="525" REF="531">
city of Edinburgh had been proved, he would that in&s;tant
give his vote for the commitment of the bill. He &s;aid,
if gentlemen would lay their hands upon their hearts,
and a&s;k them&s;elves, whether they would have voted in
this manner had the ca&s;e of Edinburgh been that of the
city of Bri&s;tol, York, or Norwich, he was per&s;uaded
they would have required that every tittle of the charge
again&s;t them &s;hould have been fully and undeniably
proved. Some amendments and mitigations being in&s;erted
in the bill, it pa&s;&s;ed the Hou&s;e, was &s;ent back to the
Lords, who agreed to the alterations, and then received the
royal a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVIII. The next e$$ort of the mini&s;ter was ob|liquely
levelled at the liberty of the pre&s;s, which it was
much for his intere&s;t to abridge. The errors of his con|duct,
the my&s;tery of that corruption which he had &s;o
&s;ucce&s;sfully reduced to a &s;y&s;tem, and all the blemi&s;hes of
his admini&s;tration, had been expo&s;ed and ridiculed, not
only in political periodical writings produced by the mo&s;t
eminent hands, but likewi&s;e in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of theatrical
pieces, which met with uncommon &s;ucce&s;s among the
people. He either wanted judgement to di&s;tingui&s;h men
of genius, or could find none that would engage in his
&s;ervice: he, therefore, employed a &s;et of wretched authors,
void of under&s;tanding and ingenuity. They undertook
the defence of his mini&s;try, and an&s;wered the animadver|&s;ions
of his antagoni&s;ts. The match was &s;o extremely
unequal, that, in&s;tead of ju&s;tifying his conduct, they ex|po&s;ed
it to additional ridicule and contempt; and he &s;aw
him&s;elf in danger of being de&s;pi&s;ed by the whole nation.
He re&s;olved to &s;ei&s;e the fir&s;t opportunity to choak tho&s;e
canals through which the torrent of cen&s;ure had &s;lowed
upon his character. The manager of a playhou&s;e com|municated
to him a manu&s;cript farce, intituled, The
Golden Rump, which was fraught with trea&s;on and abu&s;e
upon the government, and had been pre&s;ented to the &s;tage
for exhibition. This performance was produced in the
Hou&s;e of Commons. The mini&s;ter de&s;canted upon the
<PB N="524" REF="532"><GAP DESC="DUPLICATE" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="525" REF="533"><GAP DESC="DUPLICATE" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="526" REF="534">
in&s;olence, the malice, the immorality, and the &s;editious
calumny, which had been of late propagated in theatri|cal
pieces. A bill was brought in to limit the number
of playhou&s;es; to &s;ubject all dramatick writers to the in|&s;pection
of the Lord-Chamberlain; and to compel them to
take out a licen&s;e for every production before it could
appear on the &s;tage. Notwith&s;tanding a vigorous oppo|&s;ition,
this bill pa&s;&s;ed through both Hou&s;es with extra|ordinary
di&s;patch, and obtained the royal &s;anction. In
this debate the Earl of Che&s;terfield di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf
by an excellent &s;peech, that will ever endear his character
to all the friends of genius and literature, to all tho&s;e who
are warmed with zeal for the liberties of their country.
&startq;Our &s;tage (&s;aid he) ought certainly to be kept within
due bounds; but, for this purpo&s;e, our laws as they
&s;tand at pre&s;ent are &s;ufficient. If our &s;tage-players at
any time exceed tho&s;e bounds, they ought to be pro&s;e|cuted;
they may be puni&s;hed. We have precedents,
we have examples of per&s;ons puni&s;hed for things le&s;s
criminal than &s;ome pieces which have been lately re|pre&s;ented:
a new law mu&s;t, therefore, be unnece&s;&s;ary;
and in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e it cannot be unnece&s;&s;ary with|out
being dangerous. Every unnece&s;&s;ary re&s;traint is a
fetter upon the legs, is a &s;hackle upon the hands of
liberty. One of the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings we enjoy, one of
the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings a people can enjoy, is liberty.
But every good in this life has its allay of evil. Li|centiou&s;ne&s;s
is the allay of liberty. It is an ebullition,
an excre&s;cence; it is a &s;peak upon the eye of the politi|cal
body, which I can never touch but with a gentle,
with a trembling hand, le&s;t I de&s;troy the body; le&s;t I
injure the eye upon which it is apt to appear. If the
&s;tage becomes at any time licentious, if a play appears to
be a libel upon the government, or upon any particular
man, the King's courts are open; the law is &s;ufficient
to puni&s;h the offender. If poets and players are to be
re&s;trained, let them be re&s;trained as other &s;ubjects are,
by the known laws of their country; if they offend,
<PB N="527" REF="535">
let them be tried as every Engli&s;hman ought to be, by
God and their country. Do not let us &s;ubject them
to the arbitrary will and plea&s;ure of any one man. A
power lodged in the hands of a &s;ingle man to judge
and determine without limitation, control, or appeal, is
a &s;ort of power unknown to our laws, incon&s;i&s;tent
with our con&s;titution. It is a higher, a more ab&s;olute
power than we tru&s;t even to the King him&s;elf; and,
therefore, I mu&s;t think we ought not to ve&s;t any
&s;uch power in his Maje&s;ty's lord-chamberlain.&endq; His
arguments had no effect, though the Hou&s;e admired his
elocution; and the playhou&s;e bill pa&s;&s;ed into a law. On
the twenty-fir&s;t day of June the King made a &s;hort &s;peech
to both Hou&s;es, and the Lord Chancellor prorogued the
parliament.</P>
