<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_TRUTH</HI> and <HI>Fiction</HI> have, of late,
been &s;o promi&s;cuou&s;ly blended to|gether,
in Performances of this
Nature; that, in the pre&s;ent
Ca&s;e, it &s;eems ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary
to di&s;tingui&s;h the <HI>one</HI> from the <HI>other.</HI> If
<HI>Robin&s;on Cru&s;oe, Moll Flanders,</HI> and Collo|nel
<HI>Jack</HI> have had their Admirers among the
lower Rank of Readers; it is as certain,
that the Morality in Ma&s;querade, which may
be di&s;covered, in the Travels of <HI>Lemuel Gul|liver,</HI>
has been an equal Entertainment to the
&s;uperior Cla&s;s of Mankind.</P>
<P>Now it may, without the lea&s;t Arrogance,
be affirmed, that, tho' this <HI>&s;urpri&s;ing Narra|tive</HI>
be not &s;o replete with <HI>vulgar Stories</HI> as
the former, or &s;o inter&s;per&s;ed with a <HI>Satiri|cal</HI>
Vein, as the la&s;t of the abovementioned
Treati&s;es; yet it is certainly of more U&s;e to
the publick, than either of them, becau&s;e
every Incident, herein related, is real Mat|ter
of Fact. But becau&s;e my Share in this
Work, is no other than that of a bare Edi|tor;
I think it my Duty to account for
the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this Manu&s;cript.</P>
<P>It was put into my Hands, about a Year
ago, by Mr. <HI>Dorrington,</HI> an eminent Mer|chant,
<PB N="vi" REF="4">
with full Liberty to publi&s;h it when,
and in what Manner, I thought mo&s;t proper.
I hope therefore it will not be deemed imper|tinent
to give &s;ome Account of my Friend,
as a Reputation to the Work it &s;elf.</P>
<P>&startq;Mr. <HI>Edward Dorrington</HI> is de&s;cended
from a very ancient and honourable Fa|mily
in <HI>Stafford&s;hire.</HI> His Grandfather,
Mr. <HI>Jo&s;eph Dorrington,</HI> removed out of that
County, to <HI>Frome</HI> in <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire;</HI> his
Employ was that of a very con&s;iderable
Gra&s;ier: The I&s;&s;ue he left at his Decea&s;e
was one Son, <HI>Richard</HI> (the Father of my
Friend) and two Daughters. Mr. <HI>Richard
Dorrington,</HI> for &s;ome Time, was a Student
of <HI>Gray's-Inn;</HI> but, liking a Country-Life
be&s;t, he having thoroughly qualified him|&s;elf,
retired to <HI>Frome,</HI> the abovemention|ed
Re&s;idence of his Father, where he
married Mrs. <HI>Margaret Groves,</HI> of <HI>Taunton,</HI>
a Gentlewoman of about a thou&s;and
Pounds Fortune. Soon after his Marriage,
he went and &s;ettled at <HI>Bath,</HI> where the
Integrity of his fair Practice, &s;oon ren|dered
him eminent in his Profe&s;&s;ion. He
acquired a very competent E&s;tate, and
died in the Year 1708, having no other
I&s;&s;ue than his only Son, the pre&s;ent Mr.
<HI>Edward Dorrington,</HI> whom he had put to
be bred a Merchant, under the Care of
Mr. <HI>Stephen Graham</HI> of <HI>Bri&s;tol.</HI> His Di|ligence,
and courteous Behaviour, during
his Servitude, &s;o highly recommended
him to his Ma&s;ter's E&s;teem, that when
his Time was expired, he admitted him
<PB N="vii" REF="5">
into a Moiety of his Commerce, married
him to his Daughter, and gave her a hand|&s;ome
Portion &s;uitable to his Merit.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The Happine&s;s of my Acquaintance
with him, began in his Apprentice&s;hip,
and has, with the greate&s;t Satisfaction to
me continued ever &s;ince&endq;. As to the
Genuinene&s;s of this Treati&s;e, I am far|ther
to a&s;&s;ure the Reader, that as Mr. <HI>Dor|rington</HI>
is allowed by all who know him,
to be a Gentleman of unque&s;tionable Vera|city,
and above attempting an Impo&s;ition
upon the Publick; &s;o the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Book herein
was wholly written by him&s;elf, and the <HI>&s;e|cond</HI>
and <HI>third</HI> Books were faithfully tran|&s;cribed
from Mr. <HI>Quarll</HI>'s Parchment Roll,
which was a Continuation of what my
Friend had begun.</P>
<P>When Mr. <HI>Dorrington</HI> undertook this Voy|age,
he &s;et Sail, as is well known, from <HI>Bri|&s;tol</HI>
to the <HI>South-Sea,</HI> and traded all along
that Coa&s;t to <HI>Mexico,</HI> now called <HI>New-Spain.</HI></P>
<P>And he is now making a &s;econd Voyage
to the &s;ame Places.</P>
<P>To proceed to the Work it &s;elf. The <HI>fir&s;t</HI>
Book contains a Relation of Mr. <HI>Dorrington</HI>'s
Di&s;covery of Mr. <HI>Quarll,</HI> his &s;everal Confe|rences
with him; a De&s;cription of the
I&s;land, and the Manner of our <HI>Hermit</HI>'s Li|ving
there; with many other curious Parti|culars.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;econd</HI> and <HI>third</HI> Books are the Con|tents
of the <HI>Hermit</HI>'s <HI>Parchment-Roll</HI> above|mentioned,
and contain the mo&s;t &s;urprizing,
as well as various Turns of Fortune ever
<PB N="viii" REF="6">
yet recounted in any Work of this Kind.
And, altho the continued Series of Misfor|tunes
which attended him, &s;eemed to render
his Life a Precedent of the mo&s;t unhappy
State of human Nature; yet we do not find
the greate&s;t Notoriety in his Actions, that
Vengeance &s;hould pur&s;ue him &s;o clo&s;ely by
unparalelled Cro&s;&s;es. If Polygamy could call
down &s;uch divine Re&s;entments, we mu&s;t be
&s;ilent; nor farther urge his Fate.</P>
<P>However, for this Fact he was brought to
Ju&s;tice by the Laws of his Country, and he
accounts for the Inducements of his commit|ting
that Sin, at his Tyral. This Reflection
therefore &s;hould be wiped off, &s;ince he is
now become the humble&s;t of Penitents. The
Ob&s;ervations, throughout the&s;e Sheets will
be found to be mode&s;t, &s;erious, and in&s;tru|ctive,
and all center in the unerring Moral,
that,
<Q><L>Whate'er we do, or where&s;oe'er we're driven,</L>
<L>Still, we mu&s;t own, &s;uch is the Will of Heaven.</L></Q></P>
<P>To conclude, in the Publication of the&s;e
Papers, I have di&s;charged two Promi&s;es; the
one made by Mr. <HI>Dorrington,</HI> to the <HI>Hermit,</HI>
and the other made by my &s;elf to Mr. <HI>Dor|rington;</HI>
and that they may meet with a Re|ception,
as candid as they are u&s;eful, is the
hearty Wi&s;h of the Reader's humble Servant,</P>

<P>_HAVING concluded tho&s;e Mercan|tile
Affairs, which I undertook, by
this Voyage, to negotiate; and be|ing
upon my Return for <HI>England,</HI>
and wind-bound; during my Stay,
I daily walked about the Sea-&s;hore:
Very early one Morning, the Weather being ex|treme
fair, and the Sea wonderful calm, as I was
taking my u&s;ual turn, I accidentally fell into Di&s;|cour&s;e
with a Spani&s;h, <HI>Mexican</HI> Inhabitant, named
<HI>Alvarado.</HI> And, as we were viewing the Rocks
which abound in tho&s;e Seas, he de&s;ired me to take
<PB N="2" REF="14">
notice of a va&s;t long one about &s;even Leagues
from Shore, which he &s;aid was &s;uppo&s;ed to in|clo&s;e
&s;ome Land, by its great Extent; but the
Acce&s;s to it was very dangerous, by rea&s;on of the
Rocks which reach &s;o far under Water, being in
&s;ome places too &s;hallow for Boats, and in others
too deep to ford over, and the Sea commonly
very rough in that Place, hitherto prevented farther
Re-&s;earch, &s;uppo&s;ing the Advantage which might
accrue from the Land, would not countervail the
Co&s;t and Trouble of making it inhabitable; $word$
that he and &s;ome Friends had on a fine Day, $word$
it now was, the Curio&s;ity to go as near as $word$
could with Safety, which was above fifty $word$
from the main Rock, but were forced $o $word$ as
un&s;atisfied as they went; only, that he had the
Plea&s;ure of catching &s;ome delicious Fi&s;h which
lay playing upon the Surface of the Water, having
a Rod in his Hand, and Lines in his Pocket, be|ing
&s;eldom without when he walks on the Sea|&s;hore;
the&s;e Fi&s;h are &s;omewhat larger than a $er|ring
in its Prime, skinned like a Mackerel, made as
a Gudgeon, and of divers beautiful Colours, e&s;pe|cially
if catched in a fair Day, having &s;ince ob|&s;erved
that they are more or le&s;s beautiful, ac|cording
to the Serenity of the Weather.</P>
<P>The Account he gave me of them excited my
Curio&s;ity to go and catch &s;ome, and he being, as
u&s;ual, provided with Tackle, we picked up a
parcel of yellow Maggots, which breed in dead
Tortoi&s;es upon the Rock, at which tho&s;e Fi&s;hes
bite very eagerly.</P>
<P>Thus equipt with all Nece&s;&s;aries for the
Sport, we agreed with a young Fellow, one
of the Long-Boat's-Crew, belonging to the
Ship I was to come over in, who&s;e Ma&s;ter
being ju&s;t come on Shore, and not expected
<PB N="3" REF="15">
$o return &s;peedily, he readily con&s;ented to row us
$ither for about the value of a Shilling.</P>
<P>Being come to the Place, we found extraordinary
Sport, the Fi&s;hes were &s;o eager, that our Line was
no &s;ooner in but we had a Bite.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t we were fi&s;hing, the young Man that
$ow'd us thither, &s;pying a Clift in the Rock, thro'
which he &s;aw a Light, had a mind to &s;ee what was
at the other &s;ide; &s;o put off his Cloaths in order
to wade to it, thus having taken the Hitcher of the
Boat, he gropes along for &s;ure Footing, the Rock
being very full of Holes.</P>
<P>Being come to the Clift, he creeps through, and
in a &s;hort time returns, calling to us with Preci|pitation,
which expre&s;s'd both Joy and Surprize:
Gentlemen! Gentlemen! &s;aid he, I have made a
Di&s;covery of a new Land, and the fine&s;t that the
Sun did ever &s;hine on; leave off your Fi&s;h|ing,
you'll find here much better Bu&s;ine&s;s: Having
by that time catch'd a pretty hand&s;ome Di&s;h of Fi&s;h,
we put up our Tackling, fa&s;ten'd our Boat to the
Rock, and &s;o went to &s;ee this new-found Land.</P>
<P>Being come at the other &s;ide of the Rock, we &s;aw,
as he &s;aid, a mo&s;t delightful Country, but de&s;pair'd
going to it, there being a Lake about a Mile long,
at the Bottom of the Rock, which parted it from
the Land; for neither <HI>Alvarado</HI> nor my &s;elf could
&s;wim; but the young Fellow who could, having
$eap'd into the Water, finding it all the way but Brea&s;t
$high, we went in al&s;o, and waded to the other &s;ide,
which a&s;cended gently, about five of &s;ix Foot from
the Lake to a mo&s;t plea&s;ant Land, flat and level,
cover'd with a curious Gra&s;s, &s;omething like Camo|mile,
but of no Smell, and of an agreeable Ta&s;te;
it bore al&s;o abundance of fine lofty Trees, of diffe|rent
Kinds and Make, which in &s;everal places &s;tood
in Clu&s;ters, compo&s;ing Groves of different Height
<PB N="4" REF="16">
and Largene&s;s; being come to a Place where the
Trees &s;tood in &s;uch a Di&s;po&s;ition as gave our Sight
a greater Scope, we &s;aw at &s;ome di&s;tance a mo&s;t de|lightful
Wood of a con&s;iderable Extent. The A|greeablene&s;s
of the Per&s;pective, made by Nature
both for the creating Plea&s;ure and Condolance of
Grief, did prompt my Curio&s;ity to a View of the
Delights, which the Di&s;tance we were at might i$
&s;ome mea&s;ure rob us of; but <HI>Alvarado,</HI> who
till then, had di&s;cern'd nothing whereby we coul$$judge

would not venture farther that way, le&s;t we &s;houl$

Wood; and, as I could not di&s;commend his Pr$|caution,
the Thickne&s;s of it giving room to believe
there might be dangerous Creatures in it, &s;o we wer$
Southward, finding Numbers of fine Trees, a$$
here and there &s;mall Groves, which we judg'd to b$
compos'd of forty or fifty &s;everal Trees; but, upo$
Examination, we found it, to our great Amazemen$
to proceed of only one Plant, who&s;e outmo&s;t lowe$
Branches bending to the Ground, about &s;even o$
eight Foot from the middle Stem, &s;truck Root, a$$
became Plants, which did the &s;ame, and in that man|ner
covered a con&s;iderable Spot of Ground, $word$
growing le&s;s, as they &s;tood farthe&s;t from the o$$
Body.</P>
<P>Having walk'd &s;ome time under that mo&s;t &s;urpri$|ing
and wonderful Plant, admiring the Greatne&s;s $word$
Nature's Works, we went on, finding &s;everal of th$
&s;ame in our way, wherein harbour'd Monkeys, b$$
their &s;wift Flight prevented our di&s;cerning the
Colours; yet going on we found there were tw$
kinds, the one green Backs, yellow Faces and Be$|lies;
the other grey, with white Bellies and Faces
but both &s;orts exceeding beautiful.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="17">
At &s;ome di&s;tance we perceived three things &s;tand|ing
together, which I took to be Hou&s;es; I believe,
&s;aid I, this I&s;land is inhabited; for, if I mi&s;take not,
yonder are Dwellings: So they be, &s;aid <HI>Alvarado,</HI>
and therefore I don't think it Wi&s;dom to venture any
further, le&s;t they &s;hould be Savages, and do us hurt;
&s;o would have gone back; but I was re&s;olved to &s;ee
what they were, and per&s;uaded him to go on, &s;aying,
it would be time enough for us to retreat when we
perceiv'd Danger: That may be too late, &s;aid he,
for, as Evil doth not always &s;ucceed Danger, Dan|ger
doth not always preceed Evil; we may be &s;ur|priz'd.
Well, well, &s;aid I, if any &s;hould come up|on
us we mu&s;t &s;ee them at &s;ome Di&s;tance, and
if we can't avoid 'em, here's three of us, a good
long Staff, with an Iron Point at one End, and a
Hook at the other, I &s;hall exerci&s;e that, and keep
them off, at lea&s;t till you get away; come along,
and fear not, &s;o pull'd him along.</P>
<P>Being come near enough to di&s;cern better, we
found what we took for Hou&s;es were rather Ar|bours,
being apparently made of green Trees, then
indeed I began to fancy &s;ome wild People did in|habit
them, and doubted whether &s;afe or no to go
nearer, but conceal'd my Doubt le&s;t I &s;hould intimi|date
<HI>Alvarado,</HI> &s;o that he &s;hould run away, to
which he was very much inclin'd. I only &s;lac|ken'd
my Pace, which <HI>Alvarado</HI> perceiving, ima|gin'd
that I &s;aw &s;ome Evil a coming, which he
thought unavoidable; and not daring to go from
his Company, I only condol'd his Misfortune, &s;ay|ing,
he dearly repented taking my Advice, that he
fear'd we &s;hould pay dear for our &s;illy Curio&s;ity;
for indeed tho&s;e things were more like Thieves Dens,
or wild Peoples Huts, than Chri&s;tians Habitations.</P>
<P>By this time we were come near a Spot of Ground,
pretty clear of Trees, on which &s;ome Animals were
<PB N="6" REF="18">
feeding, which I took to be Goats; but <HI>Alvarado</HI>
fancy'd them to be Deers, by their &s;wift Flight
at our appearing; however I infer'd by their Shy|ne&s;s
that we were out of the way in our Judgment
concerning the Arbours; for, &s;aid I, if the&s;e were
inhabited, tho&s;e Creatures would not have been &s;o
&s;car'd at the Sight of Men; and, if by nature wild,
they would not graze &s;o near Mens Habitations, had
there been an body in them. I rather believe &s;ome
Hermit has formerly liv'd there, and is either dead
or gone: <HI>Alvarado,</HI> who to that time had nei|ther
heard nor &s;een any thing that could contradict
what I &s;aid, began to acquie&s;ce to it, and goes on.</P>
<P>Being come within reach of plain Di&s;cernment, we
were &s;urpriz'd; if the&s;e, &s;aid I, be the Works of Sa|vages,
they far exceed our expert Arti&s;ts; there Re|gularity
appear'd unconfin'd to the Rules of Art,
and compleat Architecture without the Craft of the
Arti&s;t, Nature and Time only being capable to bring
them to that Perfection. They were neither Hou&s;es,
Huts, nor Arbours, yet had all the U&s;efulne&s;s and
Agreements of each.</P>
<P>Having &s;ufficiently admir'd the uncommon Beau|ty
of the Out&s;ides, without Interruption, but rather
diverted with the mo&s;t agreeable Harmony of vari|ous
Singing-Birds, as perch'd on a green Hedge,
which &s;urrounded about one Acre of Land near
the Place, we had the Curio&s;ity to &s;ee the In&s;ide,
and being neare&s;t the middle-mo&s;t, we examin'd
that fir&s;t, it was about nine Foot high, and as
much &s;quare, the Walls very &s;trait and &s;mooth,
cover'd with green Leaves, &s;omething like tho&s;e of
a Mulberry-Tree, lying as clo&s;e and regular as Slates
on a &s;lated Hou&s;e, the Top went up rounding like
a Cupola, and covered in the &s;ame manner as the
&s;ides; from each Corner i&s;&s;ued a &s;trait Stem, about
twelve Foot higher, bare of Branches to the Top,
<PB N="7" REF="19">
which were very full of Leaves, and did &s;pread over,
making mo&s;t plea&s;ant Canopy to the Man&s;ion be|neath.</P>
<P>Being full of Admiration with the wonderful
Structure, and Nature of the Place, we came to a
Door which was made of green Twigs, neatly
woven, and fa&s;tened with a &s;mall Stick, thro' a
Loop made of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The Door being fa&s;ten'd without, gave us En|couragement
to venture in it, being evident that
the Ho&s;t was ab&s;ent; &s;o we open'd it, and the fir&s;t
thing we &s;aw, being oppo&s;ite to the Door, was a
Bed lying on the Ground, which was a hard dry
Hearth, very &s;mooth and clean; we had the Curio|&s;ity
to examine what it was made of, and found
it another Subject of Admiration; the Covering
was a Mat about three Inches thick, made of a
&s;ort of Gra&s;s, which, tho' as dry as the olde&s;t
Hay, was as green as a Leek, felt as &s;oft as Cot|ton,
and was as warm as Wool; the Bed was made
of the &s;ame, and in the &s;ame manner, but three
times as thick again, which made it as ea&s;y as a
Down Bed; under that lay another, but &s;omething
harder.</P>
<P>At one &s;ide of the Room &s;tood a Table made
of two Pieces of thin Oak Board, about three
Foot long, fa&s;ten'd upon four Sticks driven into the
Ground, and by it a Chair made of green Twigs as the
Door, at the other &s;ide of the Room lay a Che&s;t on
the Ground like a Sailor's &s;mall Che&s;t, over it, again&s;t
the Wall, hung a Linen Jacket and Breeches, as Sea|men
wear on board; on another Pin hung a large
Coat or Gown, made of the &s;ame &s;ort of Gra&s;s,
and after the &s;ame manner as the Bed's Covering,
but not above half an Inch thick, and a Cap by it
of the &s;ame; the&s;e we &s;uppos'd to be a Winter-Garb
for &s;ome body.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="20">
Having view'd the Furniture of the Dwelling, we
examin'd its Fabrick, which we could not find out
by the Out&s;ide being &s;o clo&s;ely cover'd with Leaves;
but the In&s;ide being bare, we found it to be &s;everal
Trees, who&s;e Bodies met clo&s;e, and made a &s;olid
Wall, which, by the Breadth of every Stem, we
judg'd to be about &s;ix Inches thick, their Bark being
very &s;mooth, and of a plea&s;ant Olive-Colour, made
a mighty agreeable Wain&s;cotting; the Roof, which
was hung very thick with Leaves, was Branches,
which reach'd from End to End, and were cro&s;s'd
over by the &s;ide-ones that were woven between, which
made a very even and &s;mooth Cieling, &s;o thick of
Leaves and Branches, that no Rain could penetrate:
My Companion's Unea&s;ine&s;s, expecting the Ho&s;t's
Return every Moment, hinder'd my examining eve|ry
thing more narrowly. And having &s;lightly look'd
into the Che&s;t, which lay open, wherein we &s;aw no|thing
but Sheets of Parchment, which his Ha&s;te
would not permit me to look into; we went a|way.</P>
<P>Going out, we &s;aw at one Corner of the Room be|hind
the Door a couple of Firelocks, the Sight of
which much alarm'd my Company; and, I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s,
&s;tartled me; for, till then, I was inclinable to be|lieve
&s;ome Hermit did dwell in the Place; but finding
Arms in the room of a Crucifix and religious Pi|ctures,
which are the common Ornaments of tho&s;e
religious Men, made me waver in my Opinion; and
having taken the Pieces in my Hands, which for Ru&s;t
appear'd not to have been fit for U&s;e for many
Years, renew'd my former Opinion, &s;uppo&s;ing them
to be the Effects of &s;ome Shipwreck which the Her|mit
found upon the Rocks; but my Company per|&s;i&s;ting
in their own, ha&s;ten'd out, and would have
gone quite away, without &s;eeing any more, had I
not, by many Arguments made them &s;en&s;ible, that if
<PB N="9" REF="21">
tho&s;e Arms had been intended for the evil U&s;e he
did imagine, they would have been kept in better
Order; to which being oblig'd to acquie&s;ce, he con|&s;ented
to go and examine the other, being as worthy
of Admiration as that we had &s;een, tho' quite of an|other
Nature, but much of the &s;ame Height and
Make.</P>
<P>The next we came at was cover'd all over with
the &s;ame &s;ort of Gra&s;s as grew on the Ground,
which lay as even as tho' it had been mow'd and
roll'd; behind it were &s;everal Lodges, made, as it
were, for &s;ome Dogs, but we neither &s;aw nor heard
any.</P>
<P>Having view'd the Place all round, we plac'd the
young Fellow with us at the Out&s;ide to give notice
when any body appear'd, lea&s;t we &s;hould be &s;urpriz'd,
whil&s;t we &s;aw the In&s;ide. So having open'd the
Door, which was made and fa&s;ten'd after the man|ner
of the fir&s;t; we went in, expecting to find ano|ther
Dwelling, but it prov'd rather a Kitchen,
there being no Bed, only a parcel of Shells of dif|ferent
Sizes, which we &s;uppo&s;ed to be u&s;ed for U|ten&s;ils;
&s;ome being callow'd at the Out&s;ide, as hav|ing
been on the Fire, but extreme clean within, the
re&s;t were, both In&s;ide and Out&s;ide, as fine as Nakes
of Pearl.</P>
<P>At one End of the Room was a Hole cut in the
Ground like Stew-Stoves in great Kitchens, about
three or four Foot from that there was another Fire|place,
made of three Stones fit to roa&s;t at, in both
which Places appear'd to have been Fire lately by
Wood-Coals and A&s;hes fre&s;h made. This confirm'd
my Opinion, that it was an Hermitage: <HI>Alvara|do,</HI>
who all along fear'd we &s;hould meet with Men as
would mi&s;u&s;e us, was not a little pleas'd to find Fire|places
in room of Beds, and Kitchen-Uten&s;ils in&s;tead
of Weapons. I hope, &s;aid he, we are not in &s;o
<PB N="10" REF="22">
great a Danger as I fear'd, here cannot be many
Men, unle&s;s they croud together in yonder Place;
and if &s;o they would have been here before now,
had they been in the Way. His Fears being in
a great mea&s;ure di&s;pers'd, we look'd about more lei|&s;urely,
and &s;eeing &s;everal Shells, that were cover'd,
on a Shelf that lay cro&s;s two Sticks, that were &s;tuck
in the Wall, which was made of Turff, we had the
Curio&s;ity to &s;ee what was in them, and found in
one pickl'd Anchoves, in others Mu&s;hrooms, Ca|pers,
and other &s;orts of Pickles: Let them, &s;aid I,
be who they will that dwell here, I am &s;ure they
know good Eating, and therefore probably may be
no Stranger to good Manners. Upon another Shelf,
behind the Door, lay diver&s;e &s;orts of dry'd Fi&s;hes,
and upon the Ground &s;tood uncover'd two Che&s;ts
with Fi&s;h and Fle&s;h in Salt.</P>
<P>The&s;e Provi&s;ions, being &s;omething too Epicurial
for an Hermit, gave us room for Speculation.
I have liv'd (&s;aid <HI>Alvarado</HI>) at <HI>Mexico</HI> the&s;e
&s;ix Years, and have been at <HI>Peru</HI> above twenty
times, and yet never heard talk of this I&s;land:
The Acce&s;s to it is &s;o difficult and dangerous, that
I dare &s;ay we are the fir&s;t that have been of the&s;e
&s;ides of the Rocks; I am very apt to believe that a
Company of determinate Buccaneers, which are &s;aid
to frequent the&s;e Seas, &s;helter here, and that the
Habitation we have &s;een, and this Place, belong
to their Captain, and that the Company re&s;orts in
Caves up and down the&s;e Rocks. Really I could not
well gain&s;ay it, being too probable, yet I would
not altogether acquie&s;ce to his Opinion, le&s;t
he &s;hould thereby take a Motive to go away be|fore
we had &s;een the other Place: I mu&s;t confe&s;s,
&s;aid I, here's Room for Conjectures, but no Proof
of Certainty; however let it be as you &s;ay, 'tis a
plain ca&s;e here be none to di&s;turb us, therefore whil&s;t
<PB N="11" REF="23">
we have Liberty, let us &s;ee the other Place: So
we fa&s;ten'd the Door as we $ound it, and went
to the next, which was &s;hut after the &s;ame man|ner
as the two preceding, but made of quite different
Stuff, being a complete Arbour, compos'd of Trees,
planted within a Foot of one another, who&s;e Branches
were woven together in that regular manner, that
they made &s;everal agreeable Compartiments, and &s;o
clo&s;e, that nothing but Air could enter; it was of
the &s;ame Height and Bigne&s;s with the Kitchen, which
&s;tood at the other End of the Dwelling, which made
a very uniform Wing to it.</P>
<P>The Coolne&s;s of the Arbour remov'd our Doubts
of its being another Dwelling, unle&s;s only us'd in
hot Weather.</P>
<P>Having &s;ufficiently view'd the Out&s;ide, we went
in, and found &s;everal Boards, like Dre&s;&s;ers or Ta|bles,
in a Pantry, on which lay divers broad and
deep Shells, as beautiful as tho&s;e in the Kitchen, in
&s;ome of which was Butter, in others Cream and Milk;
on a Shelf lay &s;everal &s;mall Chee&s;es, and on another
a Parcel of Roots like <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> Artichoaks, which
look'd to have been roa&s;ted: All this did but confirm
the Opinion we were in, that it was no Hermitage,
there being what to gratify the Appetite, as well as
to &s;upport Nature; therefore, not knowing what
to think of the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e, we made
no long Stay, but concluded to ha&s;te, and get our
Fi&s;h dre&s;s'd, it being near Dinner-time; and as the
Trees &s;tood very thick inland, &s;o might conceal Men
from our Sight, till come too near to &s;hun 'em; we
thought it proper to walk at the Out&s;ide near the
Rocks, that we might &s;ee &s;ome Di&s;tance before us.</P>
<P>Walking along, a Phlegm &s;ticking in my Throat,
I happened to hawk pretty loud, the Noi&s;e was an|&s;wer'd
from, I believe, twenty places of the Rock, and
in as many different Sounds, which &s;o alarm'd <HI>Al|varado,</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="24">
who took it to be a Signal from Men
conceal'd up and down the Rock, not con&s;idering
the Difficulty of their coming at us, there being a
Lake at the Foot of it, which they mu&s;t have
been oblig'd to wade over, and which would have
given us time to get away: But Fear, which often
binds Rea&s;on, did repre&s;ent the Evil infallible to
his Thought, which was morally impo&s;&s;ible. I did
all I could to make him &s;en&s;ible it was but Ecchoes,
and to convince him thereof, I gave a loud Hem,
which was an&s;wer'd in like manner, but by being a
&s;econd time repeated, and by a louder Voice, I was
certain the la&s;t did not proceed from me, which put
me in apprehen&s;ion &s;ome body be&s;ides my &s;elf had
hem'd al&s;o. My Companion, who&s;e Countenance
being turn'd as pale as Death, expre&s;s'd the Exce&s;s
of his Fears, would have run away, had not the
Voice come from the very way we were to go:
Now, &s;aid he (hardly able to utter his Words for
trembling) you are, I hope, convinc'd it would have
been &s;afer for us to retire, in&s;tead of gratifying your
unrea&s;onable Curio&s;ity, what do you think will be|come
of us? The young Fellow at the&s;e Words
falls a Weeping, &s;aying, he wi&s;h'd he had mi&s;s'd the
$etting of that Money, which was like to be dear|ly
earn'd. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I begun to be a little
apprehen&s;ive of Danger, and wi&s;h'd my &s;elf &s;afe a|way,
but conceal'd my Thoughts, heartning them
as well as I could, and repre&s;enting the Danger e|qual,
moving forwards or &s;tanding &s;till; I at la&s;t
per&s;uaded them to go on.</P>
<P>We were &s;carce gone forty Paces further, but
that we perceived at a con&s;iderable Di&s;tance &s;ome|thing
like a Man, with another Creature, but pre|&s;ently
lo&s;t them among&s;t the Trees, before we
could have a full View of them, which made eve|ry
one of us conceive a different Idea of what we
<PB N="13" REF="25">
$$ad &s;een. <HI>Alvarado</HI> would have it to be a Gi|ant,
and a Man of common &s;ize with him, and both
arm'd Cap-a-pee. The poor Lad, who was already
as bad as a Slave, being bound to a &s;evere ill-na|tur'd
Ma&s;ter fear'd Death more than Bondage, &s;o
took what he had &s;een for &s;ome She-bear, and one
of her Whelps with her, to make her yet more
dreadful; and by all means would have thrown him|&s;elf
into the Lake, in order to get at the other
&s;ide of the Rock; thus the Danger appear'd to each
of them to be what they dreaded mo&s;t; but I was
&s;omething better compos'd in Mind than they. I
gave the Object I &s;aw the likelie&s;t Re&s;emblance the
time it was in Sight did permit, which I could
adapt to nothing but a Man of common Size,
and &s;omething like a Dog with him; &s;o per&s;i&s;t|ing
in my Opinion made them waver theirs; thus
we went on &s;omething better compos'd.</P>
<P>Being gone about an hundred Yards further, we
&s;aw the &s;ame again, but nearer hand, and without
Interruption, the Place being pretty clear of Trees;
thus having a full View, we were all, to our great
Satisfaction, convinc'd, that what had been taken
for a formidable Giant, and a terrible She-bear, was
but an ordinary Man; but that which was with him
running up a Tree as &s;oon as he perceiv'd us, pre|vented
our di&s;cerning what Animal it was; but
the Man, who walk'd on a-pace, &s;oon came with|in
the Reach of a more certain Di&s;cernment, and
appear'd to be a venerable old Man, with a wor|&s;hipful
white Beard, which cover'd his naked Brea&s;t;
and a long Head of Hair of the &s;ame Colour,
which, &s;preading over his Shoulders, hung down
to his Lions.</P>
<P>His Pre&s;ence, which in&s;pir'd Re&s;pect more than
Fear, &s;oon repeal'd the frighten'd Folks &s;car'd
Sen&s;es, who, to cover this Faint-heartedne&s;s, ex|cus'd
<PB N="14" REF="26">
them&s;elves by the Mi&s;repre&s;entations Di&s;tance
cau&s;es on Objects. The old Man, who by that
time was come near enough to di&s;cern our &s;peak|ing
<HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> lets fall a Bundle of Sticks, he had
under one Arm, and a Hatchet he carried in the
other Hand, and runs at me, being the next to
him, embracing me, &s;aying, dear Countrymen, for I
hear ye are <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> by what Accident are ye come
here; a Place the Approach, whereof is defended by
a thou&s;and Perils and Dangers, and not to be come
at but by a narrow E&s;cape of Death, are ye &s;hip|wreck'd?
No, thank God, &s;aid I, mo&s;t reverend
Father, it was mere Curio&s;ity that brought us here,
tho&s;e Perils, which you &s;ay defend the Approach of
this I&s;land, being ab&s;ent by the extraordinary Calm|ne&s;s
of the Sea; but if I may ask, pray how came
you here? by the Help of Providence, reply'd the
good old Man, who &s;natch'd me from out of the
ravenous Jaws of Death, to &s;ix me in this &s;afe and
peaceable Spot of Land; I was &s;hipwreck'd, thanks
to my Maker, and was &s;av'd by being ca&s;t away. I
conceive, Sir, &s;aid I, you have been chas'd by
&s;ome Pyrates, and e&s;cap'd Slavery by &s;triking up|on
the Rocks that &s;urround this I&s;land; but now
you have avoided that di&s;mal Fate, embrace the
lucky Opportunity of getting away from a Place &s;o
remote from human A&s;&s;i&s;tance, which your Age
makes you &s;tand in need of. That's your Mi|&s;take,
reply'd the old Man, he who tru&s;ts in God
needs no other Help. I allow that, Sir, &s;aid I,
but our Tru&s;t in God doth not require us to ca&s;t
away, or de&s;pi&s;e the Help of Man. I don't in the
lea&s;t que&s;tion your Piety, but mi&s;tru&s;t the Frailty
of Nature, and Debility of Age, therefore would
have you come and live within the Reach of At|tendance;
you may, without &s;lackening your De|votion,
live in the World; you &s;hall have no
<PB N="15" REF="27">
Occa&s;ion to concern your &s;elf with any Cares that
may di&s;turb your pious Thoughts. No, reply'd
the old Man, was I to be made Emperor of the
Univer&s;e, I would not be concern'd with the
World again, nor would you require me, did you
but know the Happine&s;s I enjoy out of it; come
along with me, and if, after you have &s;een how I live
here, you per&s;i&s;t in your Advice, I will &s;ay you have
no Notion of a happy Life. I have, good Sir, &s;aid I,
already &s;een with great Admiration your matchle&s;s
Habitation, but there are other Nece&s;&s;aries which
your Age requires, as Cloaths to defend the Injuries
of the Air, and Meat &s;uitable to the Weakne&s;s of
your Stomach. That's your Mi&s;take, reply'd the
old Man, I want for no Cloaths, I have a Change
for every Sea&s;on of the Year, I am not confin'd to
Fa&s;hions, but &s;uit my own Conveniencies. Now
this is my Summer Dre&s;s, I put on warmer as the
Weather grows colder; and for Meat, I have Fi&s;h,
Fle&s;h and Fowls, and as choice as Man can wi&s;h
for; come, you &s;hall dine with me, and ten
to one but I may give you a Veni&s;on, and
perhaps a Di&s;h of wild Fowls too; let's go
and &s;ee what Providence has &s;ent us. So we
went to a Wood, about a Mile further, where
he had fa&s;ten'd &s;everal low Nets at different
Gaps in the Thick-&s;et, in one of which happen'd
to be an Animal, &s;omething like a Fawn as big a|gain
as a Hare, and the Colour of a Fox, fac'd
and footed like a Goat: Did I not tell you, &s;aid
the Good Man, I might chance to give you Veni|&s;on?
Now let's look after the Fowls; &s;o we went
a little further at a Place where he had hung a long
Net between two high Trees, at the Bottom of
which was fa&s;ten'd a Bag of the &s;ame to receive
the Fowls, who in the Night being &s;top'd by the
Net, $lutter'd to the Bottom. There al&s;o happen'd
<PB N="16" REF="28">
to be Game, a couple of Fowls made like Wood|cock,
but the Bigne&s;s and Colour of a Phea&s;ant,
were taken at the Bottom of the Bag: Now, &s;aid
the old Man, the&s;e I have without committing the
Sin of bidding le&s;s for them than I know they are
really worth, or make the Poulterers &s;wear they
co&s;t them more than they did. Well, now I may
give you a Di&s;h of Fi&s;h al&s;o, 'tis but going hal$
a Mile, or thereabouts. There's no need, Sir$
&s;aid, I, for any more, there's but four of us, and
here's Provi&s;ion for half a &s;core; but if you are
di&s;pos'd for Fi&s;h, we have &s;ome in a Boat at the o|ther
&s;ide of the Rock; 'tis but going for them.
Very well, &s;aid the old Man, 'tis but going above
a Mile, then &s;trip and wade over a Lake, then climb
up a rugged Rock twice backward and forward to
fetch what we can have for only taking a plea&s;ant
Walk, all the while diverted with the &s;weet Har|mony
of a number of Fine Birds; look here, this
Complai&s;ance often puts Men to a World of needle&s;s
Trouble; come, we'll make &s;hift to pick a Dinner
out of the&s;e. Sir, &s;aid I, 'tis no Shift where there's
&s;uch Plenty. Plenty! &s;aid the old Man, why I tell
ye this is a &s;econd Garden of <HI>Eden,</HI> only here's no
forbidden Fruit, nor Women to tempt a Man. I
&s;ee, Sir, &s;aid I, Providence &s;upplies you plentifully
with Nece&s;&s;aries, did not Age deprive you of
Strength. Age! reply'd the old Man, why I'm
not &s;o old as that comes to neither; I was but
eight and twenty when I was ca&s;t away, and that's
but fifty Years ago: Indeed if I did live as you do
that dwell in the wi&s;e World, who hurry on your
Days as if your End came on too &s;low, I might be
accounted old. I don't gain&s;ay, reverend Father,
but that you bear your Age wonderful well; but
Multiplicity of Days mu&s;t make the &s;tronge&s;t Na|ture
bend: Yes, Time will break the toughe&s;t Con|&s;titution,
<PB N="17" REF="29">
and by what you &s;ay you have &s;een a
con&s;iderable Number of years. Yes, reply'd the old
Man, a few Days have ran over my Head, but I ne|ver
&s;trove to out-run them, as they do that live too
fa&s;t: Well, &s;ays he, you are a young Man, and have &s;een
le&s;s Days than I, yet you may be almo&s;t worn out;
come, match this, &s;ays he; with that he gave a Hem with
&s;uch a Strength and Clearne&s;s, that the Sound made
my Ears tingle for &s;ome Minutes after. Indeed, Sir,
&s;aid I, you have &s;o far out-done what I can pretend
to do, that I will not pre&s;ume to imitate you.
Then I am afraid, &s;ays he, you will prove to be the old
Man. Well then, you or your Friend, the &s;trong|e&s;t
of you, fetch hither that Stone, it does not
look to be very heavy (pointing at a large Stone
that lay about two Yards off.) I'll endeavour, Sir,
&s;aid I, to roll it, for I dare &s;ay 'tis pa&s;t my Strength
to lift it: So, to plea&s;e the old Man, I went to take
it up, but could hardly move it. Come, come, &s;aid
the old Gentleman, I find that mu&s;t be work for me;
with that he goes, takes up the Stone, and to&s;&s;es it
to the Place he bid me bring it: I &s;ee, &s;aid he, you
have exerted your Strength too often, makes you
$ow &s;o weak: Well, you &s;ee the Advantage of liv|ing
remote from the World; had you had le&s;s of
human A&s;&s;i&s;tance, I am apt to believe you would
not want it &s;o &s;oon as you are likely to do; come, let's
make much of that little Strength we have left,
by taking nece&s;&s;ary Support at proper times; 'tis
now pa&s;t Noon, therefore let's lo&s;e no time, but
ha&s;te home to get our Dinner ready; &s;o we went
back to the Place where the Bundle of Sticks lay,
which we made the young Fellow with us to carry,
and went directly to the Kitchen, where, whil&s;t
he made a Fire, one ca&s;t the Animal, and the other
two pull'd the Fowls. I am &s;orry, &s;aid the old
Man, you mu&s;t take that Trouble, but your Pre&s;ence
<PB N="18" REF="30">
has frightned away my Servant, who us'd to do that
Work for me. Have you a Servant then, Sir, &s;aid I?
Yes, &s;aid he, and one a Native of this I&s;land. Then,
I find, Sir, &s;aid I, this I&s;land is inhabited. Yes, an|&s;wered
the old Man, with Monkeys and my &s;elf,
but no body el&s;e, thank God; otherwi&s;e, I can tell
you, I &s;hould hardly have liv'd &s;o long. Then, Sir,
&s;aid I, I &s;uppo&s;e that was it we &s;aw run up a Tree.
Yes, &s;aid he, my Monkey, like my &s;elf, love not much
Company. Pray, Sir, &s;aid I, how did you bring
him &s;o well under Command, as to keep with you,
when he has Liberty to run away? I wonder the wild
ones do not intice him from you. I had him young,
reply'd the old Man, and made very much of him,
which tho&s;e Creatures dearly love; be&s;ides, when he
was grown up the wild ones would not &s;uffer him
among&s;t 'em; &s;o that he was forc'd to remain with
me. I had another before this; but him, I may &s;ay,
was &s;ent by Providence, both to be a Help and Di|ver&s;ion
to me; for he was &s;o knowing, that he took
a great deal of Labour off my Hands, and di&s;pers'd
many anxious Hours, the Irk&s;omene&s;s of my Solitude
did create; 'tis $ow about twelve Years &s;ince, for I
keep a Memorial, which indeed I de&s;igned to have
been a Journal, but I unfortunately let the regular
order of the Days &s;lip out of my Memory; howe|ver
I ob&s;erve a &s;eventh Day, and reckon the Years
from Winter to Winter, &s;o I cannot well mi&s;take.</P>
<P>One Day that I had roa&s;ted a Quantity of Roots,
which I eat in&s;tead of Bread, having &s;pread them on
my Table and Che&s;t to cool, in order to lay them
by for u&s;e, I went out, leaving my Door open to let
the Air in.</P>
<P>Having walk'd an Hour or two I returned home,
where I found a Monkey, whom the Smell of the
hot Roots had brought, who, during my Ab&s;ence,
had been eating: My Pre&s;ence very much &s;urpriz'd
<PB N="19" REF="31">
him, yet he &s;till kept his Place, only di&s;continued eat|ing,
&s;taring me in the Face. The unexpected Gue&s;t
at once &s;tartled me, and fill'd me with Admiration;
for certainly no Creature of its kind could be com|par'd
to it for Beauty; his Back was of a lively
green, his Face and Belly of a lively yellow, his
Coat all over &s;hining like burni&s;h'd Gold: The ex|traordinary
Beauty of the Creature rais'd in me an
ardent De&s;ire to keep him, but de&s;par'd of ever mak|ing
him tame, being come to its full Growth; there|fore
having re&s;olv'd to keep him ty'd, I went in and
&s;hut the Door; the Bea&s;t, who till then had not of|fered
to make his E&s;cape, appear'd very much di|&s;turb'd,
and &s;tar'd about him for &s;ome Place to get
$ut at; perceiving his Di&s;order, I did not advance,
$ut turn'd my back to him, to give it time to com|po&s;e
it &s;elf, which he, in a &s;hort time, did, as ap|pear'd
by his falling to eat again, which made me
conceive hopes, that I &s;hould in time make him fa|miliar;
having about me &s;tale roa&s;ted Roots, which
$at much plea&s;anter than the fre&s;h, and are le&s;s
$tuffing, I threw &s;ome at him, at which he &s;eem'd
$i&s;pleas'd, and &s;tood &s;till a while, &s;taring in my Face;
$ut my looking well pleas'd, which I believe the Ani|$al
was &s;en&s;ible of, made him pick them up, and fall
$word$ eating with a fre&s;h Appetite. I was overjoy'd
$t his ea&s;y Compo&s;ure, &s;o reach'd him Water in a
$hell, that the want of nothing might induce him
$word$ a Retreat, I &s;et it down as near him as I could
without di&s;turbing him, he came to't very orderly
$nd having drank his Fill, he laid it down, and lookt
$word$ in the Face, carele&s;sly &s;cratching his Back&s;ide;
$eeing he had done, I advanc'd and took away the
$hell, at which he never &s;tir'd.</P>
<P>The forward Di&s;po&s;ition of the Bea&s;t, towards a
$erfect Familiarity, made me re&s;olve to &s;tay within
$word$ Remainder of the Day, no wi&s;e que&s;tioning but
<PB N="20" REF="32">
my Company would, in a great mea&s;ure, advance it;
&s;o I made a Shift to &s;up upon a few Roots I had a|bout
me, and went pretty early to Bed; where I
was no &s;ooner laid, but the Creature got a-cro&s;s the
Feet thereof, and continued very quiet till the next
Morning that I got up, at which time he was al&s;o
watching my Actions: I made very much of him,
which he took very compo&s;edly, &s;tanding to be
&s;troak'd; then indeed I thought my &s;elf, in a man|ner,
&s;ecure of him, and gave him his Belly-full, as
the Day before, but having a pre&s;&s;ing Occa&s;ion to go
out, I went to the Door, thinking to &s;hut him in
till my Return; but he follow'd me &s;o clo&s;e, that I
could not open it, without endangering his getting
out, which, tho' he appear'd pretty tame, I did not
care to venture, our Acquaintance being &s;o very new;
yet as I was oblig'd to go, I did run the Hazard; &s;o
opened the Door by Degrees, that if in ca&s;e the Bea&s;t
&s;hould offer to run, I might take an Opportunity to
&s;lip out and keep him in; but the Creature never
offering to go any further than I went, I did
tru&s;t him to go with me, hoping, that if he went
away, the kind U&s;age he met with, would one Day
or other make him come back again; but to my great
prize, as well as Satisfaction, he readily return'd
with me, having waited my time; yet as I had
occa&s;ion to go out a &s;econd time, wanting Sticks
to make fire, for which I was oblig'd to go near
the Place where mo&s;t of his kind did re&s;ort, I was
afraid to tru&s;t him with me, le&s;t he &s;hould be decoy'd
by the others; therefore having taken up a Bundle
of Cords wherewith I tie up my Faggots, I watch'd
an Opportunity to get out, and leave him behind;
but the Bea&s;t was certainly apprehen&s;ive of my De|&s;ign;
for it always kept near the Door, looking wi&s;h|fully
at my Bundle of Cords, as de&s;irous of &s;uch
another, which having not for him, I cut a Piece
<PB N="21" REF="33">
$ff mine, and gave it him; and &s;eeing I could not
$eave him behind, I ventur'd to let him go with me,
which he did very orderly, never offering to go one
Step out of the way, tho' others of his kind came
$o look at him as he went by.</P>
<P>Being come to the Place where I us'd to cut dry
Sticks, having cut down a &s;ufficient Quantity, I be|gan
to lay &s;ome a-cro&s;s my Cord; the Creature,
having taken notice of it, did the &s;ame to his, and
with that Dexterity and Agility, that his Faggot
was larger and &s;ooner made than mine, which by
$hat time being large enough, and as much as he
$ould well carry, I bound it up, which &s;et him to
$word$ the &s;ame with his, which was abundantly too
$arge a Load for him.</P>
<P>Our Faggots being made, I took up that which I
had made, to &s;ee how he would go about taking up
$is, which being much too heavy for him, he could
$ot lift; &s;o runing round it I believe twenty times,
$e look'd me in the Face, as craving Help: Hav|ing
been &s;ufficiently diverted with the out-of-the-way
$hifts he made, I gave him mine, and took up
$is; the poor Animal appear'd overjoy'd at the
Exchange, therefore cheerfully takes up the Bundle,
and follows me home.</P>
<P>Seeing my &s;elf, according to all Probability, &s;ure
of the dear Creature, who&s;e late Actions gave me
&s;uch Grounds to hope from him both Service and
Plea&s;ure, I return'd my hearty Thanks to kind Pro|vidence
for his late prodigious Gift; for certainly
it was never heard of before, that in a De&s;art
Place, &s;uch wild Animals, who fly at the &s;ingle Ap|pearance
of a human Creature, &s;hould voluntarily
give it &s;elf to a Man, and from the very Begin|ning
be &s;o docile and tractable; Oh! &s;urely it was
endu'd with more than natural In&s;tinct; for perfect
Rea&s;on was &s;een in all its Actions: Indeed I was
<PB N="22" REF="34">
happy whil&s;t I had him, but my Happine&s;s, alas!
was not of long &s;tanding. As he &s;poke I perceiv'd
Tears in his Eyes; Pray, Sir, &s;aid I, what became
of that wonderful Creature? Ala&s;s! &s;aid he, he
was kill'd by Monkeys of the other kind, who fell
upon him one Day as he was going for Water by
him&s;elf; for the poor dear Creature was grown
&s;o knowing, that if at any time either Firing or
Water was wanted, I had nothing to do, but to
give him the Bundle of Cords or the empty Ve&s;&s;el,
and he would &s;trait go and fetch either; in &s;hort,
he wanted nothing but Speech to complete him for
human Society. Indeed, Sir, &s;aid I, I cannot blame
you for bemoaning the Lo&s;s of &s;o incomparable a
Creature; the Account you give of him well de|&s;erves
his Memory a Regret; but I hope this you
have now, in a great mea&s;ure, makes up your Lo&s;s.
O! not by far, reply'd the old Man, indeed he goes
about with me, and will carry a Faggot, or a Ve&s;|&s;el
of Water, pick a Fowl, turn the Spit or
String when Meat is roa&s;ting; yet he is nothing
like my late dear <HI>Beaufidelle;</HI> for &s;o I call that mo&s;t
lovely Creature; be&s;ides this is unlucky, in imitating
of me he often does me Mi&s;chief: 'Twas but t'other
Day, that I had been writing for five or &s;ix Hours, I
had occa&s;ion to go out, and happen'd to leave my
Pen and Ink upon my Table, and the Parchment I
had been writing on clo&s;e by it; I was no &s;ooner
gone but the mi&s;chievous Bea&s;t falls to work, &s;cra|bling
over every Word I had been writing; and
when he had done he lays it by in the Che&s;t, as
he &s;aw me do what I had written, and takes out
another, which he does the &s;ame to, and &s;o to
half a &s;core more; my Return prevented his doing
more Mi&s;chief; however in a quarter of an Hour
that I was ab&s;ent, he blotted out as much as I
had been full &s;ix Months writing; indeed I was an|gry,
<PB N="23" REF="35">
and could have beaten him, but that I con&s;idered
my Revenge would not have repar'd the Damage, but
rather perhaps add to my Lo&s;s, by making the
Bea&s;t run away. Pray, Sir, &s;aid I, how came you
$y him, did he al&s;o give him&s;elf to you? No,
reply'd the old Man, I had him young, and by mere
Accident, unexpected and un&s;ought for, having lo&s;t
both Time and Labour about getting one in the
Room of him I had &s;o unfortunately lo&s;t: The
$ld ones are &s;o fond of their young, that they
$ever are from them, unle&s;s in their Play they
$hace one another in the other kinds Quarters, where
$heir Dams dare not follow them; for they are &s;uch
Enemies to one another, that they watch all Oppor|$unity
to catch whom they can of the contrary &s;ort,
whom they immediately &s;trangle, which keeps their
Encrea&s;e very backward, that would otherwi&s;e
$row too numerous for the Food the I&s;land produces;
which is, I believe, the Cau&s;e of their Animo&s;ity.</P>
<P>About eight Years ago, which is the time I have
had this Bea&s;t, I was walking under one of the Clu&s;ters
of Trees where the green &s;ort of Monkeys harbour,
which being the large&s;t and mo&s;t &s;hady in the I&s;land
$word$ took the mo&s;t delight therein; as I was walking, at
a &s;mall Di&s;tance from me this Creature dropt off
$word$ Tree, and lay for dead, which being of the grey
kind, made me wonder le&s;s at the Accident: I
went and took him up, and accidentally handling
his Throat, I open'd his Wind-pipe, which was al|mo&s;t
&s;queez'd clo&s;e by that which took him, whom
my &s;udden Coming prevented from &s;trangling quite.
I was extreamly pleas'd at the Event, by which I got
what my pa&s;t Cares and Diligence never could pro|$ure
me. Having pretty well recovered its Breath,
and &s;eeing no vi&s;ible Hurt about it, I imagin'd I
&s;oon might recover him quite; &s;o ha&s;ten'd home
with it, gave it warm Milk, and laid it on my Bed;
<PB N="24" REF="36">
&s;o that with careful nur&s;ing, I quite recover'd him&punc;
and with good Keeping made the Rogue thrive to
that degree, that he has out-grown the re&s;t of hi$
kind. No que&s;tion, Sir, &s;aid I, having taken &s;uch
Pains with him, you love him as well as his Pre|dece&s;&s;or.
I cannot &s;ay &s;o neither, reply'd the old
Man, tho' I cannot &s;ay but that I love the Crea|ture,
but its having the ill Fortune to be of tha$
unlucky kind as was the Death of my dear <HI>Beau|fidelle,</HI>
in a great mea&s;ure le&s;&s;ens my Affection; be|&s;ides
he falls &s;o &s;hort both of his Merit and Beau|ty,
that I mu&s;t give the deceas'd the Preference; and
was it not for his cunning Tricks, which often di|vert
me, I &s;hould hardly value him at all; but $word$
is &s;o very cunning and facetious, that he makes
me love him, notwith&s;tanding I mortally hate his
kind: I mu&s;t divert you whil&s;t Dinner is getting
ready, with an Account of &s;ome of his Tricks.</P>
<P>Being extreme fond of me, he never &s;carce would
be from me, but follow me every where; and as he
us'd to go with me when I went to examine my
Nets, &s;eeing me now and then take out Game, he
would of his own accord, when he &s;aw me bu&s;y
writing, go and fetch what hapen'd to be taken.</P>
<P>One Day finding a Fowl in the Net-bag, he pull'd
it alive as he brought it home; &s;o that I could not
&s;ee any thing whereby to di&s;cern its kind: As &s;oon
as he came in he &s;ets it down with &s;uch Motions
as did expre&s;s Joy; the poor naked Fowl was no
&s;ooner out of his Clutches, but that it took too its
Heels for want of Wings; its &s;udden E&s;cape &s;o
&s;urpriz'd the Captor, that he &s;tood amaz'd for a
while, which gave the poor Creature time to gain a
con&s;iderable Scope of Ground; but the a&s;toni&s;h'd
Bea&s;t, being recovered from his Surprize, &s;oon made
after it, but was a con&s;iderable time before he could
catch it, having nothing to lay hold of, &s;o that the
<PB N="25" REF="37">
Fowl would &s;lip out of his Hands: The Race held
about a quarter of an Hour, in which time the poor
Creature, having run it &s;elf out of Breath, was
forc'd to lie down before its Pur&s;uer, who imme|diately
threw him &s;elf upon't, &s;o took it up in his
Arms, and brought it home; but was not &s;o ready
to &s;et it down as before; for he held it by one
Leg till I had laid hold of it.</P>
<P>I had a &s;econd time as good Diver&s;ion, but after
another manner: One Morning early, whil&s;t I was
bu&s;y in my Cottage, he went out unperceiv'd by
me, and having been a con&s;iderable time ab&s;ent,
I fear'd &s;ome &s;uch another Accident had befallen
him as had done his Predece&s;&s;or; &s;o I went to
&s;ee after him, and as he would often go and vi|&s;it
the Nets in the Wood, I went thither fir&s;t,
where I found him very bu&s;y with &s;uch an Animal
as this we have here, whom he found taken in
one of the Gap-nets, who, being near as big as he,
kept him a great while &s;trugling for Ma&s;ter&s;hip;
&s;ometimes he would take it by the Ears, now and
then by one Leg, next by the Tail, but could not
get him along; at la&s;t he laid hold of one of his hind
Legs, and with the other Hand &s;mote him on the Back,
in order to drive him, not being able to pull him a|long;
but the Bea&s;t being too &s;trong, &s;till made
towards the Thick-&s;et, where he certainly would
have haul'd the Driver, had not I came up to help
him. Thus the old Gentleman entertain'd us with
his Monkey's Tricks whil&s;t Dinner was dre&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>The Dinner being ready, we went to the Dwelling
to eat it, leaving the young Fellow that was with us
to attend the roa&s;t Meat whil&s;t we eat the fir&s;t Di&s;h.</P>
<P>The old Gentleman having laid the Cloth, which,
tho' &s;omething coar&s;e, being made out of part of a
Ship-&s;ail, was very clean: He laid three Shells on
it, about the Bigne&s;s of a middle-&s;iz'd Plate, but as
<PB N="26" REF="38">
beautiful as any Nakes of Pearl I ever &s;aw. Gentle|men,
&s;ays he, if you can eat off of Shells, ye are wel|come,
I have no better Plates to give you. Sir,
&s;aid I, the&s;e are preferable to Silver ones in my
Opinion, and I very much que&s;tion whether any
Prince in <HI>Europe</HI> can produce &s;o curious a Service.
They may richer, reply'd the old Man, but not
cleaner.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Di&s;h he &s;erv'd was Soop in a large deep
Shell, as fine as the fir&s;t, and one Spoon made
of Shell, which he &s;aid was all his Stock, being not
us'd nor expecting Company; however he fetch'd
a couple of Mu&s;cle-&s;hells, which he wa&s;h'd very
clean, then gave <HI>Alvarado</HI> one, and took the other
him&s;elf, obliging me to make u&s;e of the Spoon;
&s;o we &s;at down, <HI>Alvarado</HI> and I upon the Che&s;t,
which we drew near the Table, and the old Gentle|man
(tho' much again&s;t his Will) upon the
Chair.</P>
<P>Being &s;at down we fell to eating the Soop, who&s;e
fragrant Smell did excite my Appetite, and I profe&s;s
the Ta&s;te thereof was &s;o excellent, that I never eat any
comparable to't at <HI>Pontack</HI>'s, nor any where before;
it was made of one half of the Bea&s;t we took in
the Morning, with &s;everal &s;orts of Herbs which eat
like Artichoaks, A&s;paragus and Sallery; there were
al&s;o Bits of roa&s;ted Roots in it, in&s;tead of toa&s;ted
Bread, which added much to the Richne&s;s of it,
ta&s;ting like Che&s;nuts; but what &s;urpris'd me mo&s;t,
there were green Peas in it, who&s;e extraordinary
Sweetne&s;s was di&s;cernable from every other Ingredi|ent.
Pity, &s;aid I, the Acce&s;s to this I&s;land is &s;o dif|ficult,
what a ble&s;&s;ed Spot of Land would it make
was it but inhabited! here naturally grows what in
<HI>Europe</HI> we plough, till, and labour hard for. You
&s;ay, reply'd the old Man, this would be a ble&s;&s;ed
Spot of Ground if it was inhabited; now I am quite
<PB N="27" REF="39">
of another Opinion; for I think its Ble&s;&s;ing con&s;i&s;ts
in its not being inhabited, being free of tho&s;e
Cur&s;es your populous and celebrated Cities regorge
of; here's nothing but Prai&s;es and Thank&s;givings
heard; and as for Nature be&s;towing freely and of
her own Accord, what in <HI>Europe</HI> you are oblig'd to
by Indu&s;try and hard Labour, in a manner to force
From her, wonder not at; con&s;ider howmuch you
$$aily rob her of her due, and charge her with Slan|der
and Calumny; don't you frequently &s;ay, if a
Man is addicted to any Vice, that it is his Nature,
when it is the Effect and Fruit of his Corruption?
$o Nature, who attended the great Origine of all
$hings at the Creation, is now, by vile Wretches,
$$eem'd in fault for all their Wickedne&s;s; had Man
$emain'd in his fir&s;t and natural State of Innocence,
Nature would al&s;o&punc; have continued her original In|$ulgence
over him; we may now think our&s;elves
very happy, if that Ble&s;&s;ing attend our Labour,
which, before the Fall of Man, did flow on him, ac|$ompanied
with Ea&s;e and Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Now the&s;e Peas, which have &s;o much rais'd your
$urprize, are indeed the Growth of this I&s;land,
$ho' not its natural Product, but the Gifts of Provi|$ence,
and the Fruit of Labour and Indu&s;try. I
$ave till'd the Ground, Providence procur'd the Seed,
Nature gave it Growth, and Time Increa&s;e; with
even Peas and three Beans I have, in four Years time,
$ais'd Seed enough to &s;tock a Piece of Ground, out
of which I gather a &s;ufficient Quantity for my
$&s;e, be&s;ides pre&s;erving fre&s;h Seed. No doubt, Sir,
$aid I, but, when right Means are taken, Pro&s;perity
will attend. By that time having eaten &s;uffici|$ntly
of the Soop, he would him&s;elf carry the
Remains to the young Man in the Kitchen, and
$etch in the boil'd Meat and Oy&s;ter-Sauce, which
$e brought in another Shell much of the &s;ame Na|$ure
as that which the Soop was &s;erv'd in, but
<PB N="28" REF="40">
&s;omething &s;hallower, which did eat as choice as
Hou&s;e-Lamb.</P>
<P>Having done with that, he fetches in the other
half of the Bea&s;t roa&s;ted, and &s;everal &s;orts of de|licate
Pickles I never eat of before, and Mu&s;hrooms,
but of curious Colour, Flavour and Ta&s;te; tho&s;e,
&s;aid he, are the natural Product of a particular Spot
of Ground, where, at a certain time of the Year, he
did gather for the Space of &s;ix Days only, three &s;izes
of Mu&s;hrooms; for tho' they were all Buttons and
fit to pickle, by that time he had gathered all, he had
al&s;o to &s;tew, and &s;ome about four Inches over, which
he broil'd, and eat as choice as any Veal-Cutlet.</P>
<P>The&s;e Pickles, Sir, &s;aid I, tho' far exceeding any
I ever did eat in <HI>Europe,</HI> are really at this time need|le&s;s,
the Meat wanting nothing to rai&s;e its Reli&s;h,
no Fle&s;h being more delicious.</P>
<P>Having done with that, I offered to take it away,
but he no wi&s;e would permit me, &s;o went away with
it him&s;elf, and brought the Fowls, at which I was
&s;omething vexed; for I fear'd I &s;hould find no room
in my Stomach for any, having eat &s;o heartily of the
Meat; but having, at his pre&s;&s;ing Reque&s;t ta&s;ted of
'em, my Appetite renew'd at their inexpre&s;&s;ible De|liciou&s;ne&s;s,
&s;o I fell to eating afre&s;h.</P>
<P>Having done with that Di&s;h, the young Man,
who having nothing to do in the Kitchen, came,
and was bid to take away and fall to; the mean
time the good old Man fetch'd us out of his Dary
a &s;mall Chee&s;e of his own making, which being
&s;et down, he related to us the unaccountable
Manner he came by the Antelopes that &s;upply'd
him with the Milk it was made withall, which
introduc'd &s;everal weighty Remarks on the won|derful
Acts of Providence, and the Strictne&s;s of the
Obligations we lie under to our great Benefactor;
likewi&s;e the va&s;t Encouragement we have to love
<PB N="29" REF="41">
$nd &s;erve God, the Benefits and Comforts of a clear
Con&s;cience, as al&s;o the ine&s;timable Trea&s;ure of Con|$ent;
from that he epitomiz'd upon the different
Tempers and Di&s;po&s;itions of Men, much commend|$ng
timely Education, as being a Means to rever&s;e
and change evil Inclinations, highly prai&s;ing the
Charity of tho&s;e pious People, who chu&s;e to be&s;tow
good Schooling upon poor Folk's Children before
Clothing, and even Food; the fir&s;t being rather the
mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary, and the la&s;t the ea&s;ie&s;t to come at.</P>
<P>That Di&s;cour&s;e being ended, he inquired very
carefully after the State of his dear native Country,
which, he &s;aid, he left fifty Years age, in a very in|dulgent
Di&s;po&s;ition. I gave him the be&s;t Account
I could at that time of all the Tran&s;actions that
had happen'd in <HI>England</HI> &s;ince his Ab&s;ence. The
Relation of pa&s;t Evils, &s;aid he, are but like Pi|ctures
of Earthquakes and Shipwracks, which af|fect
the Mind but &s;lightly; and tho' I think my
&s;elf out of any Prince's Power, yet I &s;hall always
partake with my Countrymen's Grief: Pray be im|plicite,
what King have we now? A compleat Pa|triot,
and Father to his Subjects, &s;aid I, both tender-hearted
and merciful, encouraging Virtue and &s;up|pre&s;&s;ing
Vice, a Promoter of Religion, and an Ex|ample
of Charity. Then, &s;aid he, in a manner as
expre&s;&s;ed Zeal and Joy, long may that pious Mo|narch
live, and his ble&s;&s;ed Po&s;terity for ever grace
the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Throne, and may <HI>Old England,</HI> by its
faithful Obedience and Loyalty, henceforth attone
for its pa&s;t Rebellions, that it may remove that
execrable Reproach it now lies under; to which
we all &s;aid <HI>Amen.</HI> Then he fill'd up the Shell we
drank out of, and drank good King <HI>George</HI>'s Health,
which was &s;ucceeded with that of the Royal Family,
and Pro&s;perity to the Church: Thus ended a mo&s;t
delicious and &s;plendid Dinner, and a Conver&s;ation
<PB N="30" REF="42">
both delightful and in&s;tructive; but having not a$
then mentioned any thing about his own Hi&s;tory,
which I mo&s;t &s;adly long'd to inquire into, I beg'd
him to inform us by what Accident he came
there, and how he had &s;o long maintain'd &s;o good
a State of Health; to which he an&s;wer'd, Time
would not permit him to relate his own Hi&s;tory,
being very long, and the Remainder of the Day
too &s;hort, but that he would, before we did part,
give it me in writing; having, for want of other
Occupation, made a Memorial: But as to the main|taining
of his Health, he would tell me by word of
Mouth; the Receipt, &s;aid he, is both &s;hort and
ea&s;y, yet I fear you will not be able to follow it;
look you, you mu&s;t u&s;e none but whol&s;ome Exer|ci&s;es,
ob&s;erve a &s;ober Diet, and live a pious Li$e;
now if you can confine your &s;elf to this way o$
Living, I'll be bound that you will both pre&s;erve
your Health, and wa&s;te le&s;s Money; but what's
more valuable than all that, you will not endan|ger
your precious Soul. I return'd him Thanks
for his good Advice, and promis'd him I would
ob&s;erve them as &s;trictly as I could: I am afraid,
reply'd he, that will not be at all; you have too
many powerful Ob&s;tacles, the World and the Fle&s;h,
from whom your Affections mu&s;t be intirely with|drawn,
and all Commerce prohibited, which is mo|rally
impo&s;&s;ible, whil&s;t living; therefore &s;ince you
are oblig'd to conver&s;e with the World, I will
give you a few Cautions, which, if rightly taken,
may be of u&s;e to you.</P>
<Q><P>Make not the World your Enemy, nor rely too much
on its Fidelity.</P>
<P>Be not too free witb your Friend; Repetitions of Fa|vours
often wear out Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="43">
Wa&s;te not your Vigour or Sub&s;tance on Women, le&s;t
Weakne&s;s and Want be your Reward.</P>
<P>Secrets are not &s;afe in a Woman's Brea&s;t; tis a Con|finement
the Sex can't bear.</P>
<P>Pa&s;s no Contract over Liquor; Wine overcomes Rea&s;on,
and d$lls the &V;nder&s;tanding.</P>
<P>He who games puts his Money in Jeopardy, and is not
&s;ure of his own.</P>
<P>There's but little Honour to wager on &s;ure Grounds,
and le&s;s Wi&s;dom to lay upon a Chance.</P></Q>
<P>And in all your Dealings take this for a con&s;tant
Rule.</P>
<Q><L>He who unlawful Means advance to gain,</L>
<L>In&s;tead of Comfort, finds a con&s;tant Pain;</L>
<L>What e'en by lawful Arts we do po&s;&s;e&s;s,</L>
<L>Old Age and Sickne&s;s make it comfortle&s;s.</L>
<L>Be rul'd by me, not to encrea&s;e your Store</L>
<L>By unju&s;t Means; for 'twill but make you poor:</L>
<L>Take but your Due, and never covet more.</L></Q>
<P>I return'd him Thanks for his good Morals, the
Copy whereof I beg'd he would give me in writing,
for my better putting them in Practice, to which he
$eadily con&s;ented, wi&s;hing I might ob&s;erve them,
$eing very &s;ure I &s;hould reap a con&s;iderable Bene|fit
thereby, both here and hereafter.</P>
<P>The Day being pretty far &s;pent, I was oblig'd to
$hink of going, which much griev'd me; for I was
$o taken with his Company, that if I had not had a
Father and Mother, who&s;e Years requir'd my Pre|&s;ence,
I would have &s;pent the re&s;t of my Days with
him, I was &s;o delighted with his Company, and
pleas'd with his way of Living, that I almo&s;t over|$ook'd
my Duty; but after a Struggle with my Incli|nation,
I was oblig'd to yield to Nature. Thus
<PB N="32" REF="44">
having expre&s;s'd my Vexation to leave &s;o good a Man,
I took my leave: The good old Man perceiving my
Regret to leave him, could not conceal his to part
with me. Indeed, &s;aid he with Tears in his Eyes,
I &s;hould have been very glad to have had a Fellow-Creature
in this &s;olitary I&s;land, e&s;pecially one whom
I think po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with a good Inclination, which I
perceive you have, by your Reluctancy in leaving
this innocent Garden of Life. I imagine you have
Relations in the World that may &s;tand in want of
you; Heavens protect you, and &s;end you &s;afe to
them. I don't &s;uppo&s;e you will ever &s;ee this I&s;land
again, nor would advi&s;e you to venture, the Ap|proach
of it is &s;o dangerous; therefore, before
you go, let me &s;hew you &s;ome of the Rarities
with which it abounds. I told him I was afraid
Time would not permit, but as he &s;aid about an
Hour or two would do, and that we had enough
Day-light, I went along with him.</P>
<P>Going out, and &s;eeing the Guns &s;tand behind the
Door, I ask'd what he did with them: I keep them,
&s;aid he, for a Trophy of Providence's Victory over
my Enemies, and a Monument of my fourth mira|culous
Deliverance: As we went along, he related
to us the manner how he had been &s;acrilegiou&s;ly rob'd
once by <HI>Indians,</HI> villainou&s;ly inve&s;ted twice by Py|rates,
the Ruffans having combin'd to carry him away
like a Slave to their own Country, and there make
a Shew of him as tho' he had been a Mon&s;ter.</P>
<P>Talking, we walk'd under &s;everal of the afore|mention'd
Clu&s;ters of Trees, which proceed from
one &s;ingle Plant; being come to one larger than
the re&s;t, and which he &s;aid he frequented mo&s;t,
being the large&s;t in the I&s;land. This, &s;aid he, co|vers
with its own Branches a whole Acre of Land;
&s;o made &s;everal Remarks on the wonderful Works
of Nature, which, &s;aid he, were all intended for the
<PB N="33" REF="45">
U&s;e and Plea&s;ure of Man, every thing in the Uni|$er&s;e
containing &s;uch different Vertues and Proper|$ies,
as were requi&s;ite to render Life happy; from
$hat he made &s;everal moral Reflections on the fa|$al
Effects of Di&s;obedience, which is accounted a
$ight Breach in Duty, but is the Mother of all
$ins.</P>
<P>That Di&s;cour&s;e held on a con&s;iderable time, till a
$arcel of each different Kind of Monkeys having
$et, fell to fighting, ob&s;erving an admirable Order
$uring the Fray, which withdrew our Admiration
$rom the preceding Subject, and &s;topt us a while to
$b&s;erve them.</P>
<P>The Scuffle was very diverting whil&s;t it la&s;ted,
$hich was but a &s;hort time; for they happened
$o perceive us, at which they parted, each &s;ort run|$$g
to their own Quarters, which were not very di|$tant
from one another, &s;o that from it they could
$ee each others Motions: I am &s;orry, &s;aid I, the
$attle was &s;o &s;oon over; they did cu$f one a|$other
&s;o prettily, that I could have &s;tood an Hour
$o &s;ee them. If you like the Sport, &s;aid the old
Man, I can &s;oon &s;et them at it again: With
$hat he takes out of his Breeches Pocket &s;ome
$oa&s;ted Roots, which he commonly carry'd about
$im to throw at 'em when he went that way,
$hich made them le&s;s &s;hy of him.</P>
<P>Having broke the Roots in Bits, he lays them
$lown in their &s;ight; for they on both &s;ides were
$eeping from under the Leaves of the Trees where
they harbour'd: Then he cuts a Score of Sticks,
about the Bigne&s;s of ones Finger, and near a
Foot and an half long, and lays them over the
Bits of Roots; then we retir'd to &s;ome &s;mall Di|&s;tance,
and hid our&s;elves behind the Trees.</P>
<P>We were no &s;ooner out of &s;ight but that they
$ha&s;tned to the Meat; the green Monkeys, having
<PB N="34" REF="46">
le&s;s Ground to go, were at them fir&s;t, yet never
&s;top'd, but went on to hinder the others Approach,
who vigorou&s;ly &s;trove to gain Ground. The Strug|gle
was hard, and the Victory often wavering; each
party alternatively gave way; at la&s;t the grey &s;ort
kept the Advantage, and drove their Adver&s;aries
back, who being come where the Sticks lay, imme|diately
took them up, and charg'd their Enemies
with a fre&s;h Courage, like a yielding Army that
has receiv'd new Forces: Thus, with their Club|&s;ters
in the Front, fell on their Adver&s;aries with
&s;uch a Vigour, knocking them down like our
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mob at an Election, &s;o drove them back
again almo&s;t to their own Quarters.</P>
<P>In the mean time Straglers of both the kinds,
who had not join'd with the main Bodies of the
Armies, &s;eeing the Coa&s;ts clear, and the Provi&s;ions
unguarded, unanimou&s;ly fell to plunder, and qui|etly
did eat what their Comrades fought for;
which the Combatants perceiving, left off &s;ight|ing,
and of one accord turn'd upon the Plunder|ers,
who by that time having devoured the Booty,
left them the Field without contending any far|ther.</P>
<P>The Battle being over, the old Gentleman would
have us to go on, le$t, &s;aid he, they &s;hould fall
to it again out of Revenge; for tho&s;e Creatures
are very &s;piteful.</P>
<P>Having di&s;pers'd them by our advancing, as in|tended,
we walk'd from under the Trees, at the
Out-&s;ide, to have a better View of the Rock, which
in &s;ome places, he &s;aid, did change its Form as one
approaches it; and, as he &s;aid, being got clear
of the Trees, we &s;aw at a di&s;tance, as it were, a
con&s;iderable Number of Buildings, and here and
there &s;omething like Steeples, which repre&s;ented a
hand&s;ome City; and &s;eemingly the Hou&s;es appeared
<PB N="35" REF="47">
&s;o plain, that had I not been prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd of the
Illu&s;ion, I &s;hould have taken it for &s;uch; but
<HI>Alvarado</HI> and the young Fellow could not be
per&s;uaded but what we &s;aw were really Buildings,
and even in the I&s;land, tho' the old Gentleman
made us &s;top a while, the better to ob&s;erve every
thing; then bid us keep our Eyes fix'd at what
we look'd at, and go on; we perceiv'd every Parti|cular
of what we ob&s;erv'd to change its Form;
that which at fir&s;t &s;eem'd to be fronting, &s;hew'd
$t &s;elf either &s;ideways or backwards; and &s;o of
every Object, till being come at a certain Di&s;tance,
$ll the Agreeablene&s;s of the Per&s;pective, of a &s;ud|$en
turn'd into its real Shape, like a Phantom,
who, whil&s;t the vi&s;ible &s;creens that which it &s;tands
$efore, by its vani&s;hing leaves it di&s;cover'd.</P>
<P>Being come as near the Rock as the Lake that parts
$word$ would permit, we could di&s;cern nothing in it
$hat could in the lea&s;t &s;often its Ruggedne&s;s, or
$ive it a more agreeable A&s;pect than tho&s;e that
$re repre&s;ented in the Pictures of Shipwrecks.</P>
<P>The old Gentleman thereupon made &s;everal
$earned Ob&s;ervations on the Alterations that Di|$tance
works upon Objects, and how ea&s;ily our
$pticks may be deceiv'd, drawing from thence
his Inference, that we ought not to be too po|$tive
of the Reality of what we &s;ee afar off, nor
$word$ affirm for Truth that which we only heard
$f.</P>
<P>Having ended that Di&s;cour&s;e, he brought us to
$e other &s;ide of a jetting part of the Rock;
$hich advancing like a Ba&s;tion of a fortified Wall,
$reen'd from our Eyes a &s;econd piece of Wonder;
$word$ fine Rainbow, i&s;&s;uing as it were out of the
Mouth of a Giant, lying on the Rock, reaching
$ite over the Lake: At the Bottom of it I
$uld not but &s;top to admire the various Colours
<PB N="36" REF="48">
it was of, which far exceeded in Beauty and
Liveline&s;s any I ever &s;aw in the Skie. I pre&s;ent|ly
imagin'd it proceded from the Rays of the Sun
upon &s;ome Pond or &s;tanding Water, who&s;e Refle|xions
did ri&s;e and meet the Top, &s;o caus'd that
beautiful Circle. But <HI>Alvarado,</HI> who, by what he
had &s;een before, concluded the I&s;land was en|chanted,
&s;aid it was another Illu&s;ion, of which
the Place was &s;ull, and would have gone away,
but that the old Man fell a laughing, and &s;aid
'tis a Sign you &s;eldom enquire into natural Cau&s;es;
well, do but come a little nearer to it, and you
will &s;ind that which you term an Illu&s;ion is
the natural Effect of all Fountains when the Sun
&s;hines.</P>
<P>Being come to the Place it proceeded from,
it prov'd, as he &s;aid, only a Fountain, but of the
cleare&s;t and &s;weete&s;t Water that ever was ta&s;ted;
but the place it did i&s;&s;ue out of, was changed
from the Likene&s;s of a Giant, to that of &s;ome
&s;trange &s;ort of Creature, which, tho' having no
particular Re&s;emblance, yet would bear being com|par'd
to &s;everal different things. The old Man's
Opinion was that it re&s;embled a Whale, &s;purting
Water out at one No&s;tril: <HI>Alvarado</HI> &s;uppos'd&punc; it
was more like a Hor&s;e or a Cow, and rather the
la&s;t, there being Horns plain to be &s;een; for my
part I could $ind no proper Similitude for it, but
that of an old ruin'd Monument, which formerly
they did build over the Heads of Springs. <HI>Ti|mothy
Anchors,</HI> (for that was the Name of the young
Fellow that was with us) being ask'd what he could
make of it; why really, &s;aid he, nothing unle&s;s
it be an old patch'd up Pump that &s;tands at the
end of my Mother's Court in <HI>Ro&s;emary Lane</HI> (which
every Spring runs out of it &s;elf) which Compari|&s;on
made us all to laugh.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="49">
Thus we differ'd in our Opinions as to the
Likene&s;s, yet agreed that was the fine&s;t Fountain
and the be&s;t Water we ever &s;aw or drank. What
&s;urpriz'd me mo&s;t, was the Force wherewith it
&s;prung from the Rock that &s;tood full five Yards
from the Place it fell on, which was another Sub|ject
of Admiration, for certainly the Arts of Men
could not have invented nor completed a more
compact or plea&s;anter Ba&s;on, tho' it had been for
a Fountain to adorn a Monarch's Garden: Indeed
there was no Ma&s;ons nor any expert Arti&s;ts exqui|&s;ite
Works to be &s;een, but a great deal of Nature's
matchle&s;s Under&s;tanding: There Regularity, Di|men&s;ion,
and Proportion did concert to make it
u&s;eful, convenient and agreeable.</P>
<P>The Ba&s;on was very near round, about eight
Foot Diameter, a Bank around it near a Foot
high, and as broad at Top, &s;lanting gently to the
Bottom, both in&s;ide and out&s;ide, which made a
mo&s;t plea&s;ant and uniform Bank, adorned with va|rious
&s;mall Flowers and Herbs of divers beautiful
Colours and mo&s;t fragrant Smells.</P>
<P>Having view'd with Plea&s;ure and Amazement
&s;uch Regularity in a wild and uninhabited Place,
I walked about it as long as the time I could
&s;tay would permit; I propos'd going, but the old
Gentleman, taking me by the Hand, &s;top'd me; you
have, &s;aid he, be&s;tow'd a con&s;iderable time, ob&s;erv|ing
the Fertility of this I&s;land; now pray allow
one Minute for Con&s;ideration; the Object you have
been admiring all this time is as wonderful and
&s;urprizing as beautiful and plea&s;ant; you &s;ee this
Fountain, which runs &s;tiff and as large as your
Thumb, and therefore by Computation may be al|low'd
to give near hundred Gallons of Water in an
Hour; now it runs Night and Day, it neither de|crea&s;es
nor runs over its Bank, but keeps to the
<PB N="38" REF="50">
&s;ame Height. This, as you &s;ay, Sir, &s;aid I, is re|ally
worth inquiring into; &s;o I went &s;everal times
round it, &s;earching for the Place, whereby the O|verplus
of the Complement did expel, but could
not di&s;cover it: Come, &s;aid he, &s;eek no more for
that which Nature has &s;o well conceal'd; I have
&s;pent many Hours in that Inquiry, and &s;till re|main
ignorant, but have found the Place out of which
it runs into a fine Fi&s;h-pond, about a Mile inland;
we will make it in our way to the Lake; we may
look at it as we go by, but can make no long
&s;tay, &s;o we went on.</P>
<P>Going along we came by a hollow part of the
Rock, which went in like an Alcove, with a great
many Concavities in it in Rows one above ano|ther,
as round Nitches where Figures did &s;tand:
Now, &s;aid the old Man, we are here; I will en|tertain
you with an invi&s;ible Chorus of harmo|nious
Voices, little inferior to Hautboys, Trum|pets,
or other melodious Mu&s;ick; here I twice
come and pay my Devotions each Day. <HI>Alva|rado,</HI>
who, by what he had already &s;een, was pre|po&s;&s;e&s;s'd
that the I&s;land was full of Enchantments,
now was certain of it, and look'd upon that Place
in the Rock to be the Receptacle of Fiends and
evil Spirits; &s;o would by no means &s;tay; but takes
his leave, &s;aying he was not very curious of &s;u|pernatural
Things. Supernatural, &s;aid the old
Man, you can't well call it, tho' to you it may
be very amazing; it is therefore well de&s;erving
your Sight, I mean your hearing, the Eyes having
no &s;hare in the Entertainment; we &s;hall only &s;ing
a few P&s;alms; I'm &s;ure there can be no harm in
that, but rather good, being a holy Exerci&s;e in
divine Wor&s;hip, in which all good Souls ought
to join. That may be, &s;aid <HI>Alvarado,</HI> but I love
to &s;ee tho&s;e with whom I wor&s;hip: I don't think
<PB N="39" REF="51">
my &s;elf as yet Company for Spirits; as for your
part, &s;aid <HI>Alvarado,</HI> (&s;peaking to me) you may
do what you plea&s;e, but take care your Curi|o&s;ity
don't co&s;t you too dear: <HI>Tim</HI> and I will wait
for you in the Boat; but pray be not too long
before you come, &s;o having return'd the old Gen|tleman
thanks for his kind Entertainment, they
went away, at which the good Man was much
affronted: What, &s;aid he, doth your Friends ima|gine
I deal with Spirits! be&s;ides where did he e|ver
hear that Devils lov'd to &s;ing P&s;alms? for
here &s;hall nothing el&s;e be &s;ung: I would not for
the World that tho&s;e admirable Ecchos, that hi|therto
have repeated nothing but the Almighty's
Prai&s;es, &s;hould be polluted with the Sound of any
profane Words. I endeavoured to excu&s;e their
Timerou&s;ne&s;s, &s;aying it was not a Failing pecu|liar
to them&s;elves only, but to many be&s;ides:
The old Man allow'd it, attributing the cau&s;e
thereof to a very pernicious Cu&s;tom Nur&s;es have
to frighten Children, when they cry, with Buggabos
and &s;uch things to make them quiet, which fright|ful
Ideas often make &s;uch deep Impre&s;&s;ions on their
pueril Minds, that when they come to mature Age
it is then hardly worn out, which intimidates
many.</P>
<P>That Di&s;cour&s;e being ended, we advanced as near
that part of the Rock as the Lake would per|mi$,
which in that Place was not above &s;even or
eight Foot broad, &s;o that we were within the
Concavity of the Rock: Now, &s;aid the old Man,
let us &s;it down on this Bank, and &s;ing the hundred
and &s;eventeenth P&s;alm. Indeed Sir, &s;aid I, I don't
know it by heart, and I have no P&s;alm-book about
me; well then, &s;aid he, I'll &s;ing by my &s;elf, &s;o
begins, but with &s;uch a clear and loud Voice,
manag'd with &s;o much Skill and Judgment, that
<PB N="40" REF="52">
it exceeded all the Singing I ever heard before
and was repeated by &s;uch a Number of melodious
Ecchos, that one would have believ'd there wa$
a hundred Voices in Chorus.</P>
<P>The Melody did &s;o tran&s;port me, that I willingly
would have &s;pent not only the Remainder of the
Day, but the &s;ucceeding al&s;o, the Exta&s;y having
quite put out of my Mind the Nece&s;&s;ity of my
going, and the Danger of delaying: But the good
Man, having &s;ung an Evening Hymn after th$
P&s;alm, which he &s;aid he &s;ung every Night, h$
takes me by the Hand: Now, &s;aid he, is not thi$
Emulation, who but would &s;ing with &s;uch a Cho|rus
of Choiri&s;ters as you might imagine was there
Indeed Sir, &s;aid I, this has &s;o great Re&s;emblance t$
the Relation we have given us in Holy Hi&s;tory, o$
the cele&s;tial Joys the ble&s;&s;ed do po&s;&s;e&s;s in Heaven
that I thought my &s;elf already there; for which
rea&s;on I would willingly end my Days here
That's impo&s;&s;ible, &s;ays the old Gentleman, nor ca$
you &s;pend many more Moments here: I have th$
Fi&s;h-pond to &s;hew you, yet come, let's go; &s;o
we went on about fifty Paces from thence mor$
inland, we &s;aw at a &s;mall Di&s;tance, between th$
Trees, a Parcel of Fowls like Ducks, but con&s;i|derably
larger, flew away at our Approach, from
the Pond, as we advanc'd; he told me how h$
came by the old one that bred them, of whom
he was rob'd.</P>
<P>At length being come to the Pond, I was &s;ur|pris'd
at the Clearne&s;s of the Water, at the Bot|tom
of which were like large Rubies, Emeralds,
Jacinths and other colour'd Stones; till being
come to the Brink of it, that which I took for
precious Stones prov'd to be Fi&s;hes by their &s;wim|ing
about, which, to my thinking, look'd like Stars
launching from Place to Place in the Sky, Hav|ing
<PB N="41" REF="53">
&s;pent &s;everal Minutes in admiring the &s;ur|prizing
Nature and Beauty of the Fi&s;hes, I took
notice of the Pond, which was about forty Yards
in Length, and near thirty in Breadth; its Form
was a broken Oval, &s;inking in and out here and
there, which made it the more agreeable; all
round it grew diver&s;e &s;orts of Herbs intermix'd
with Flowers of different Colours, and here and
there a Basket on Sticks, which the old Man told
me he made and &s;et there for his Ducks to breed
in: The Day being far &s;pent, the old Man, after
having &s;hew'd me the Places at one &s;ide of the
Pond wherein the Ba&s;on did empty it &s;elf, as al&s;o
the other &s;ide whereby the Pond run into the Lake,
takes me by the Hand; come, &s;aid he, I will keep
you no longer, Night comes on apace, and the
Retreat from this I&s;land dangerous; therefore I
would have you improve the &s;hort Remains of
the Day to avoid the Dangers the Darkne&s;s of the
Night may lead you into, &s;o let us go home, that
I may give you the Memorial I have promis'd you,
and then my Ble&s;&s;ing and hearty Prayers for your
&s;afe Departure and happy Arrival. So we went to
his Habitation, where he gave me a Roll of Parch|ment;
here it is, &s;aid he, in a rough and unpo|lite
Language; for I did not write it out of O&s;ten|tation
or to exert my Parts, but to keep me in
mind of the many Mercies I have receiv'd from
Heaven ever &s;ince my Youth, and to record the
wonderful Effects of Providence.</P>
<P>That if ever the&s;e Writings &s;hould have the
Luck to fall into the Hands of Men after my
Decea&s;e, they might be an Encouragement to the
De&s;titute, and a Comfort to the Afflicted, that he
who rightly applies him&s;elf and firmly tru&s;ts in the
Almighty, &s;hall, at his Extremity, find Relief; and
now my Intent is in &s;ome mea&s;ure an&s;wered, ex|pecting
<PB N="42" REF="54">
you will revi&s;e and publi&s;h it when you
come to <HI>Old England;</HI> I mu&s;t rejoin you not to
give it out as my own Dictation, but a Hi&s;tory
taken from Heads out of my Memorial; for I have
been oblig'd to in&s;ert Particulars, and u&s;e &s;uch Ex|pre&s;&s;ions,
without which the Account I give of my
&s;elf would have been imperfect, and which being
related as by me, may chance to be accounted Self-flattery,
which is a Cen&s;ure I would willingly a|void.
I told him he might depend upon't, I
&s;hould always, and on all Accounts, be very ten|der
of any thing that could in the lea&s;t le&s;&s;en the
Merit of the Subject, or tarni&s;h the Lu&s;tre of the
Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>With that the good Man takes me in his naked
Arms, and embraces me over and and over with all
the Tenderne&s;s Words and Actions could expre&s;s,
&s;aying, with Tears in his Eyes, that my Exit was
a renewing of his pa&s;t Grief, and would for a con|&s;iderable
time damp the Plea&s;ures he before my
Coming did enjoy in his Solitude. Since now he
again has had the Comfort to conver&s;e with one
of his dear Countrymen, after full fifty Years be|ing
&s;ever'd from human Society; the Height of
his Grief having for &s;ome Moments &s;top'd the
Utterance of his Words, he &s;ighing laid his Head
upon my Neck, &s;queezing me clo&s;e into his
Arms.</P>
<P>This mo&s;t tender and moving Action mov'd me
to a reciprocal Grief; never did any Man reflect
with more Reluctancy than when I parted with
that good old Man, who having recover'd in &s;ome
mea&s;ure his former Firmne&s;s of Mind, his Soul
being again re&s;ign'd, we repeated our Embraces
with a mutual Affection; then I took my leave;
b$t he would not part with me there, he would
by all means wait on me to the Lake I was to
<PB N="43" REF="55">
wade over to come at the Rock, on the other
&s;ide of which the Boat waited for me; and when
I came there he would al&s;o have waded over with
me, that he might have the Satisfaction of &s;eeing me
&s;afe from the dangerous Rock, but I would in no
wi&s;e permit him. Thus having prevail'd upon him
to &s;tay behind, I prepared to wade over; &s;o after a
few more Embraces, I cro&s;s'd the Lake, and came
to my impatient Companions, who receiv'd me
with heavy Reprimands, for tru&s;ting my &s;elf &s;o
long alone with that Necromancer; for nothing,
&s;aid they, &s;hall ever per&s;uade me a Man can have
&s;uch Plenty of Dainties with only the Help of
Nature; no, no, he may talk of Providence as
much as he plea$es, he applies to the Black Art;
and tho&s;e Voices, he calls Ecchos, are his invi&s;i|ble
Imps, which (if Truth be known) are often
employ'd in rai&s;ing the Wind and cau&s;ing Storms,
which render the&s;e Seas often &s;o dangerous, and
it has been ob&s;erv'd that few or no Ships come
near tho&s;e Rocks, and e&s;cape being &s;tav'd; for my
part I a&s;&s;ure you I don't think my &s;elf &s;afe whil&s;t
within the Reach of his Enchantments; with that
he takes one of the Oars out of young <HI>Tim</HI>'s Hand,
and falls to rowing: Indeed, &s;aid <HI>Tim,</HI> as you &s;ay,
he look'd very much like a Conjurer with his
long Hair and Beard; and I believe he is a con|juring
now; &s;ee here's bad Weather a coming; let's
make ha&s;te from tho&s;e Rocks.</P>
<P>Even as he &s;aid, in &s;hort, &s;o it happen'd; for
in a little time after the Wind did ri&s;e, and the
Sea began to be a little rough; &s;o that I was forc'd
to take the Hitcher, and with it keep the Boat
from the Rocks where the Waves did very often
drive us; but &s;tanding out to Sea, the Wind grew
more calm, and fair for the Continent: I took one
of the Oars, and by Help of our Sail in a &s;hort
<PB N="44" REF="56">
time we got &s;afe to &s;hore, where being arriv'd
very much fatigu'd, we put up at the fir&s;t Cottage
which was inhabited with an old Man and Woman,
<HI>Indians,</HI> where we dre&s;s'd our Fi&s;h, and went to Supper,
which was &s;carce over but I was hurry'd on board,
the Wind being tack'd about, and fair for our De|parture.</P>
<P>We weigh'd Anchor on the &s;eventeenth Day of
<HI>May,</HI> 1724. and &s;tood out to Sea, and &s;ailed South
and by Ea&s;t till we arrived on the 26th at <HI>Panam$</HI>
on <HI>Terra Firma,</HI> after meeting with &s;ome &s;torm$
Weather. Here we began to traffick in our way
home, for &s;ome Corn, nece&s;&s;ary for our following
Voyage, as al&s;o Cotton, &s;ome Metals, Ro&s;in, Gum$
and Pepper: Our Stay was not long here, for we
&s;ail'd from thence on the fifth of <HI>June,</HI> the Wind
being then very favourable; but we had not &s;ail'd
above twenty Leagues till we met with a violent
Storm which la&s;ted for &s;ome Hours, and the
Wind blowing hard at North Norrh Ea&s;t, where|in
we had the Misfortune to lo&s;e our Surgeon,
one <HI>John Davis,</HI> who being imprudently upon Deck&punc;
was wa&s;h'd overboard by a prodigious Wave coming
in at our Foreca&s;tle, our Ship receiv'd no Damage
in that Storm, but our Lo&s;s in Mr. <HI>Davis</HI> was very
great, and wor&s;e than if any other Man had bee$
mi&s;&s;ing on board; &s;or we might al&s;o call him ou$
Chaplain as well as Surgeon; for by his exempla|ry
pious Life, during the time he belong'd to ou$
Ship, he might really be call'd a Divine. He was
a Man, who, as he told me, had been educated a$
<HI>Hart-Hall, Oxon,</HI> in his early Days, and de&s;ign'd
for the &s;acred Robes, but his Genius very much in|clining
to the tho&s;e mo&s;t plea&s;ant Studies, <HI>viz.</HI> Phy|&s;ick
and Surgery; he afterwards made them his
Practice; but meeting with &s;ome Misfortunes abo$$
the thirty fifth Year of his Life, he le$t <HI>England</HI> i$
<PB N="45" REF="57">
$$e Year 1711, and embark'd on board the <HI>John</HI>
$nd <HI>Mary</HI> for <HI>New England,</HI> where he liv'd till the
$ear 1723. when our Ship arriv'd at that Country,
$t that time wanting a Surgeon; for our own died
$$&s;t at our Approach near the Continent, our Cap|$ain,
on Enquiry, having an excellent Character of
Mr. <HI>Davis</HI> agreed with him for our Voyage till we
$eturn'd back thither again. I think it but ju&s;t to
$$ternize his Memory in the&s;e Memoirs, and give
$im the Character which he merited.</P>
<P>He was a pious good Man, &s;ober, ju&s;t and vir|$uous,
ready to &s;erve, but never to offend any
Man; his Morals were in&s;tructive to all that knew
$im; and his con&s;tant Exhortation (while on board
$ur Ship) to frequent daily Prayers was the rea&s;on
$e e&s;teem'd him the Doctor of our Souls, as well
$s a Surgeon to our Bodies: Nay, what was more,
$uring the time he was with us, tho' he never en|$ered
into &s;acred Orders, yet he told us he thought
$word$ his Duty to give us the be&s;t In&s;tructions he was
$apable of, for the Pre&s;ervation of our Souls and
Bodies, both which were always in Danger; and
$ccordingly after divine Service (as I may call it)
was perform'd by him in a very &s;olemn manner, he
would frequently di&s;cour&s;e on the Nature and Hei|$ou&s;ne&s;s
of the Sin of Man, which occa&s;ion'd the
Sufferings of Chri&s;t, on the Terrors of Hell and the
$oys of Heaven, as al&s;o on the glorious Creation
of the World, &s;etting forth the Works of Omni|potence
in very lively Colours, telling the Advan|tage,
Plea&s;ure and Beauty that attended a godly
Life. Sometimes his Di&s;cour&s;es would be on natu|ral
Philo&s;ophy, which were extremely well deli|ver'd;
at other times on $ome of the Sciences,
mo&s;t of which he well under&s;tood, and to which
we gave very great Attention, as being de&s;irous of
&s;uch u&s;eful Knowledge; in &s;hort, his Death was
<PB N="46" REF="58">
greatly lamented by the Captain as well as my &s;elf,
and indeed by all the Ships Crew; for he was
a Man of a quick Thought and lively Apprehen|&s;ion,
had an univer&s;al Knowledge in Things, intire|ly
free from Re&s;ervedne&s;s, but of perfect Humility
and Conde&s;cen&s;ion, mo&s;t agreeably entertaining in
his Conver&s;ation, and dear to all that ever knew
him.</P>
<P>Thus having given an imperfect Character of
that great Man, to who&s;e Memory I owe &s;o much,
I &s;hall proceed to a further De&s;cription of ou$
Voyage. As to the Coa&s;ts on tho&s;e Seas I think
it needle&s;s to make any mention thereof, they
having been &s;o well de&s;crib'd already by our mo|dern
Geographers, nor is it any ways u&s;eful to my
Purpo&s;e; &s;o that I &s;hall intirely omit it, and on|ly
give an Account of the Places where we traded
or touch'd at for fre&s;h Provi&s;ions or Nece&s;&s;aries,
and remark what happened mo&s;t worthy our No|tice
in our Voyage home to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Weather proving now more favourable, I
began to peru&s;e the Memorials of my good old
Hermit; but Oh! with what moving Sympathy did
&s;hare with him in the Multitude of his Misfortunes
during his Minor Years? nor could I le&s;s &s;ympathize
with him in the Exta&s;ies of his hermetical Life; I
read with Plea&s;ure and Amazement what he had
laboriou&s;ly tran&s;crib'd, being at that time doubt|ful
whether it would ever be peru&s;ed by any Mor|tal,
where $e &s;et forth a continued Series of Mis|fortunes,
as if link'd together by divine Providence
(whil&s;t he liv'd in the wi&s;e World as he call'd it)
and in this Account, during his aboad on that de|&s;olate
I&s;land, denotes that the omnipotent Being
had always an immediate Direction in every Cir|cum&s;tance
or Point of time; a&s;toni&s;h'd and amaz'd
I was more and more by this good Man's Precepts,
<PB N="47" REF="59">
$as abandon'd the World, content to live in a de|&s;olate
and lone&s;ome I&s;land, uninhabited by any Mor|tal
but him&s;elf, where he has had the Space of fifty
Years to reflect and contemplate on the Follies
and Misfortunes of Man, during which time his
Maxims were always his Rule of Life in every ca&s;e.
Oh! may I once more &s;ee that dear old Man who&s;e
Habitation is free from all anxious Cares, from Op|pre&s;&s;ion
and U&s;ury, and all the Evils that attend
this popular World, there would I abide and never
depart from that happy Solitude which he &s;o peace|ably
enjoys&mdash;But whether am I running&mdash;
the&s;e Contemplations has made me forget the Re|marks
of my Voyage.</P>
<P>We &s;ail'd from <HI>Panama</HI> on the &s;ixth Day of <HI>June,</HI>
and had frequent Thunder and Lightning, attend|e$
with &s;ome Rain, but nothing el&s;e extraordinary
happened. On the fifteenth we made <HI>Gorgona-Bay</HI>
in <HI>Peru,</HI> where our Boat went on &s;hore to a Village
on the Main, with twenty Hands well arm'd, re|&s;olving
to get &s;ome fre&s;h Provi&s;ions at any Rate;
for we began to be in want, having taken in but
very little at <HI>Panama.</HI> It is a low Land, full of
Mangrove Trees, and within Land pretty high;
the Village was but poor; however they brought
away &s;ix Hogs, and four Goats, &s;ome Mines and
$antins. Not far from thence are &s;ome Gold
Mines, but of no very great Note, as we were
informed by &s;ome <HI>Indians.</HI> They are a very war|like
People that live on that Coa&s;t, who often engage
one another with Clubs and Darts made of hard
Wood. The I&s;land is about &s;ix Leagues in Length:
There are Monkeys, Lizards, Hares and <HI>Guinea</HI>
Pigs; al&s;o &s;everal Sorts of Snakes, &s;ome of which
a$e as big as one's Leg; &s;o that it is dangerous
to walk in &s;ome Parts of the I&s;land. One of our
Men happened to be bit by one, and did not live
<PB N="48" REF="60">
above &s;ix Hours after; tho' his Death had been pre|vented,
I believe, had we not met with that Mis|fortune
of lo&s;ing Mr. <HI>Davis</HI> our Surgeon. Here al&s;o
we caught &s;ome Mullets, and &s;everal &s;orts of Fi&s;h
extreamly good, tho' unknown to us as&punc; to their
Names. At this I&s;land there is a Creature the <HI>Indians</HI>
call a <HI>Mundago,</HI> but the <HI>Spaniards</HI> a <HI>Sloth,</HI> which I
think is its propere&s;t Name; for it is a Creature
that &s;eems to &s;leep as it walks by its &s;low Motion:
and it is reported that it eats the Leaves of Tree$
which is its Food, but is &s;o prodigious lazy, th$$
when it has clear'd one Tree of its Leaves, it wi$$
be almo&s;t &s;tarv'd to death before it attempts to
climb another; in &s;hort it is a very ugly Creature,
&s;eeming to be of the Monkey kind by its Make, b$$
its Hair is thicker and longer, and he is not &s;$
&s;ightly to look at, and is different in Nature
Here we al&s;o got fre&s;h Water and Wood; fo$
there is very good Brooks on that I&s;land; an$
Wood enough. While we lay near that I&s;land I wen$
on &s;hore, and in my Conver&s;ation with a <HI>Spaniar$</HI>
he related to me the following Account of on$
<HI>Thomas Jenkins</HI> a <HI>Lanca&s;hire</HI> Man, who was Boat$
&s;wain on Board a Merchant's Ship, who&s;e Name $word$
have &s;ince forgot, that was left on that I&s;lan$
and lived alone there two Years and three Months
but was fir&s;t &s;een on that I&s;land by &s;ome <HI>Indian&punc;</HI>
that came from the Main for Oy&s;ters and oth$$
Shell-fi&s;h, which they frequently gather for the <HI>Spa|niards:</HI>
He made his E&s;cape from them, and h$$
him&s;elf in the Woods, fearing that they might ca$|ry
him to the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and by that means $word$
might be made a Slave, chu&s;ing rather his Solitud$
that enter into Bondage for his Life; however a$
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship trading on that Coa&s;t had notice of $word$
from the <HI>Indians,</HI> and imagining he might be a$
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man, ca&s;t away or &s;et on &s;hore there ($word$

was really &s;o) by &s;ome Pirates, who had been in
$o&s;e Seas: They &s;ent their Boat with &s;ix Hands
$o the I&s;land, in Search of him; they took their
$peaking Trumpet with them, and by that Means,
$word$ about &s;ix Hours Stay on the I&s;land, they found
$im out: He told them, that at his fir&s;t being &s;et
$n Shore upon the I&s;land, it &s;eem'd very melancho|$$ and
frightful, when he began to reflect on the
$arbarity of the Pirates, to leave him there without
$rovi&s;ions, or any Manner of Nece&s;&s;aries, whereby
$e might &s;upport him&s;elf (they leaving him only
$s wearing Cloaths, and his Pocket-Knife; had
$ey left any Fire-Arms and Amunition, his Ca&s;e
$$d not been near &s;o de&s;perate, becau&s;e he then
$ight have not only defended him&s;elf from any E|$emy,
but likewi&s;e have kill'd &s;ome Goats or Fowls
$r his Su&s;tenance). He al&s;o &s;aid, what made him
$ery melancholy, was to think his Habitation, and
$ace of Abode, mu&s;t be where he could have no
$umane Society, and in an I&s;land, that he at fir&s;t
$ew not whether there was any Thing on it for his
$b&s;i&s;tance, as never being on that Coa&s;t before.
$ut the &s;econd Day of his being there, he took
$word$ Survey of the I&s;land, and found there was Mon|$ys,
Goats, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and al&s;o good Fi&s;h: He dreaded

$d &s;een before; however, as they endeavour'd to
$word$ from him, he re&s;ted pretty well &s;atisfy'd,
$ping their was no Bea&s;t of Prey to hurt him
$ere, for Fear of which, at fir&s;t, he climb'd in|$$
a Piamento Tree to &s;leep. He was well pleas'd
$word$ find &s;uch good Shell-Fi&s;h, which was the only
$$od he liv'd on the fir&s;t five Days, when, by Ac|$dent,
he caught a young Kid, which very much
$$joyc'd him; but he was at a great Lo&s;s for Fire
$word$ dre&s;s it, till having nothing to employ him&s;elf
$th, but thought he remember'd that he had heard
<PB N="50" REF="62">
Rubbing two Sticks of Wood hard together pro|duced
Fire; he try'd the Experiment, and by
rubbing two Pieces of Piamento Wood together
did produce him Fire (after the Manner the <HI>Indi|ans</HI>
make U&s;e of) he then made a Fire, as having
Wood enough, and broiled Part of his Goat, which
Was a delicious Meal to him. He afterwards be|gan
to build him a Hutt to dwell in, where $word$
liv'd and dre&s;s'd his Fi&s;h and Goats Fle&s;h, b$$
could at fir&s;t only broil it, till he drove tw$
Stakes in the Ground, where he roa&s;ted it wi$$
a Wooden Spit. As to fre&s;h Water, as I ob&s;erv$
before, there was very good Brooks in the Valleys
at length he invented a Way by Thickets to e$$
&s;nare a Goat &s;ometimes, which pr$$vided him wi$$
Fle&s;h. Here were Cabbage Trees, which pro|vided
him with Sauce to his Meat, being ver$
agreeable, when &s;ea&s;on'd with the Fruit of t$
Piamento Tree, which is much like <HI>Jamaica</HI> Peppe
but afterwards he could run a Goat down. Som$$times
he had the good Luck to find &s;ome Eg$$
for there was Fowl very good: He cau$$$
&s;ome young Teal al&s;o, and by cutting their Wing$$
and keeping them always &s;o, he pre&s;erv'd them, $word$
a Brook ju&s;t by his Hutt that he had inclos$
there they bred, and were tame; but being o$
Day gone a pretty Di&s;tance from his Hutt, a la$$
Parcel of Monkeys finding them out, and that th$
could not fly away, de&s;troy'd them all. $word$
Cloaths were almo&s;t worn out, nay his Sh$$
were quite gone, and had been for &s;ome Time
but to pre&s;erve his Feet, he cut the Goat Sk$$
in the Shape of Stockings, and &s;ewed them $word$
laced them up behind with Thongs of the &s;a$
and al&s;o lac'd the Foot Part, making Holes with $word$
Knife for the Thongs, three or four Times dou$$
together, to &s;erve for Soles. The <HI>Spaniard</HI> told $word$
<PB N="51" REF="63">
$e was &s;o well nurs'd to that Way of Life, when
he was taken from the I&s;land, that it was &s;ome
con&s;iderable Time before that he could reli&s;h either
Drink or any other Victuals, which were dre&s;s'd on
Board the Ship. I gave the <HI>Spaniard</HI> an Account of
the Hermit, to which he gave very great Attention,
as al&s;o both Sea and Land Tortoi&s;e.</P>
<P>So having refre&s;h'd our &s;elves, we &s;ailed from
hence, after a Stay of three Days only in the Bay,
having got a pretty many Goats from the I&s;land,
and &s;ome Maize or <HI>Indian</HI> Corn. From thence
we &s;teer'd for the <HI>Gallapagoe</HI> I&s;lands; but in our
Pa&s;&s;age, met with &s;everal Storms and Turnadoes,
attended with very great Rains; &s;ome of our Men
began to prove very &s;ickly, which we fancy proceed|ed&punc;
from their eating the Liver of &s;ome young Seals
they had caught, it being unhealthy. After about
th$ee Days Sail, we met with frequent Calms: Du|ring
this Voyage one of our <HI>Negro</HI> Women, of
which we had three on Board, being with Child,
and near her Time, was delivered of a fine Boy,
which was of a &s;warthy Colour, &s;he had been on
Board us ever &s;ince we came from the <HI>Brazil's,</HI> and prov|ed
very nece&s;&s;ary in wa&s;hing our Linen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but <HI>Juno,</HI>
for &s;o was her Name, prov'd with Child by one of
o$ Men who&s;e Name was <HI>Thomas Higgins.</HI> I with
the Help of the two other <HI>Negro</HI> Women that was
o$ Board, perform'd the Office of a Midwi$e, and
d$$$ver'd her. I had purchas'd a little Wine at
<HI>$$$ama,</HI> which prov'd u&s;eful to mull for <HI>Juno,</HI> to
comfort her in that Condition; al&s;o one Bottle the
$$er <HI>Negro</HI> Women. <HI>Tom Higgins</HI> and I drank af|$$her
Delivery, and we were really merry on that
$$a&s;ion. The Captain was &s;omewhat di&s;pleas'd at
$word$ Accident, but being unwilling (in &s;o long a
$$age, attended with &s;o many Difficulties, as we $word$
met with before) to inflict too weighty Puni&s;h|ments
<PB N="52" REF="64">
on his Men, he only oblig'd <HI>Tom</HI> to agree,
that he &s;hould allow <HI>Diana</HI> two Pi&s;toles, when &s;he
went a Shore at <HI>Brazil,</HI> to take Care of the Child.
<HI>Tom</HI> readily agreed thereto, but had &s;ome Remor&s;e
of Con&s;cience, and began to reflect, and was really
very much concern'd, to think that the Child got
by him (tho' on a <HI>Negroe,</HI> ye$ &s;he was a Woman,
and the Child in Likene&s;s of him&s;elf, and firmly
believing that it was really begot of him, and no o|ther
Per&s;on) &s;hould be bred in <HI>Pagani&s;m,</HI> according|ly
he grew very dull and melancholy at the Thoughts
thereof, which he communicated to me, asking my
Advice about it; &s;o I per&s;waded him to be merry,
and not ca&s;t him&s;elf down, for many &s;uch
Accidents had happen'd in the We&s;t-<HI>Indies,</HI> before
then among <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men, who never thought much
of it afterward: However, this had no Operati|on
at all on him, he told me, whatever other Per|&s;ons
had been guilty of, he could not reconcile him|&s;elf
thereunto: Finding him &s;o very unea&s;ie, I ac|quainted
the Captain of it; Ay, &s;ays the Captain, is
<HI>Tom</HI> under &s;o great a Concern about the Child's be|ing
not to be educated in the Chri&s;tian Religion? Yet
Sir, &s;aid I, and I am apprehen&s;ive that it may grow
upon him very much to his Prejudice, he is &s;o ex|treamly
concern'd about it; for, &s;ays I, le&s;s Things
than that I have known People to grow melancholy
(as he &s;eems to be) and have enter'd into a State $word$
Lunacy, and never could be brought to their for|mer
Sen&s;es, but have laid violent Hands on them|&s;elves.
As he is a very hone&s;t good natur'd Fellow
(&s;etting a&s;ide this Slip) &s;aid, I wi&s;h &s;ome Expedi|ent
could be found to make him ea&s;ie. Well the$
Mr. <HI>Dorrington,</HI> &s;ays the Captain, we have the Com|mon-Prayer
Book on Board, and 'tis Pity we lo$$
poor <HI>John Atkins,</HI> our Surgeon and Chaplain, $word$
could have chri&s;tned the Child, and that woul$
<PB N="53" REF="65">
$ave &s;atisfied <HI>Tom.</HI> O Sir, &s;ays I, with your Leave,
as we have no Chaplain belonging to the Ship, now
Mr. <HI>Atkins</HI> is dead, yet as we are tollerated to bu|&s;y
our Dead, pray why not to chri&s;ten our Living
al&s;o? it can be no Crime to do a good Action.
The Captain approv'd of what I &s;aid, &s;o I told him,
with his Leave, I would be Chaplain, in that
Ca&s;e, as well as I had been Man-midwife before:
But Sir, &s;aid I, there is an Ob&s;tacle that will hin|der
us &s;till. He ask'd me what that was? Why
Sir, &s;ays I, we have not Godfathers nor Godmo|thers,
and you know, it is not accounted lawful to
perform that Ceremony, which I take it, as it's one
of the Sacraments, ought not to be perform'd, un|le&s;s
in a decent and orderly Manner, as the Church
directs in that Ca&s;e; to which the Captain an&s;wer|ed,
Why, is there not Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> our Lieutenant? I
and he will &s;tand Godfathers, and he &s;hall, as he
is <HI>Clark</HI> by Name, perform the Office of Clark
$n the Ceremony: But Sir, &s;ays I, what mu&s;t
we do for a Godmother, you know their ought to
$e one, and we have no Woman on Board that
$s a Chri&s;tian? Well then, &s;ays the Captain, the&s;e
Women we have one Board, by a little Per&s;wa&s;ion,
$ay be willing to be chri&s;ten'd them&s;elves, and if
$hey con&s;ent, they are of Age, and therefore capa|$le
of an&s;wering for them&s;elves, by which Means,
$hey may become Godmothers, on Occa&s;ion, to
$he Child: So accordingly, the Captain call'd for
$word$ Bottle of Wine, and &s;ent for <HI>Diana,</HI> one of the
<HI>Negroe</HI> Women, aged about twenty three Years:
When &s;he came into the Cabbin, the Captain fill'd
$word$ Gla&s;s of Wine, and gave it her, which, when &s;he
$ad drunk, the Captain &s;aid, &s;o <HI>Diana,</HI> 'tis to be
$op'd you won't be troubled with the Wantons,
$nd play the Trick your Si&s;ter <HI>Juno</HI> did; pray, how
$oes the Child do? to which &s;he an&s;wer'd, It be
<PB N="54" REF="66">
ver well, but it cry cry ver mu&s;h gret deal. We
&s;ays the Captain, but <HI>Diana,</HI> I &s;ent for you on an$
ther Affair, do not you remember Mr. <HI>Davis</HI> o$$
Surgeon and Chaplain? Yes, &s;ays &s;he, me ver we$
know him, he give me ver gret goot Stuff (mean|ing
a Dram:) But, &s;ays the Captain, you kno$
<HI>Diana,</HI> he was a very good Man, and us'd to $word$
you your Duty, and teach you how to &s;ay yo$$
Prayers. Yes, &s;ays &s;he, me ver well remember dat he $word$
ver goot Man. Why then, &s;ays the Captain, <HI>Diana</HI>
what do you think of being made a Chri&s;tian, an$
be chri&s;ten'd as we Chri&s;tians are? Me mak C$$$&s;tan
(&s;ays &s;he) hou. Why? &s;ays the Captain, yo$
know, Mr. <HI>Davis</HI> learn'd you to read, and you learn $word$
to &s;ay your Prayers, they are very good Prayers, $word$
they not to pray to God? Yes, &s;ays &s;he dey be ver go$$
Preyer, me lov dem ver gret mu&s;h. Well the$
&s;ays the Captain, are you willing to be good, a$$
do as tho&s;e Prayers learn you to do? Yes, &s;aid &s;h$$
me be alway be ver goot, me be ver glat, me le$$$
me Preyer, me lern more, me tank you. So $word$
the Captain's Advice, I read the publick Bapti&s;$$
of tho&s;e of riper Years, and baptiz'd her; &s;he an|&s;wering
to the Que&s;tions, by the In&s;truction of th$
Captain; and we chri&s;ten'd her by the Name of <HI>Eli|zabeth,</HI>
which was the Name of our Ship. So &s;oo$
as the Ceremony was over, the Captain order'd <HI>Eli|zabeth</HI>
to dre&s;s the Child in as decent a Manner a$$
&s;he could, and bring it to his Cabbin: In the mea$
Time we drank our Bottle of Wine. As &s;oon a$
the Child was dre&s;s'd, <HI>Elizabeth</HI> brought it to th$$
Captain, who &s;ent for <HI>Thomas Higgins,</HI> and told him
<HI>Diana</HI> was chri&s;ten'd, and that he him&s;elf and th$
Lieutenant, was to &s;tand Godfathers to his Son$
and <HI>Elizabeth</HI> Godmother, and that it was to in
chri&s;ten'd, and de&s;ired to know what Name &s;hould
be given to the Child; to which he an&s;wer'd his
<PB N="55" REF="67">
own, <HI>viz. Thomas:</HI> But I never &s;aw &s;uch an Alterati|on
any Man in my Life, as I immediately ob&s;erv'd
$word$ him; &s;o &s;uddenly it appear'd, that it &s;urpris'd
us all; for he who was before dejected, even to the
greate&s;t Degree imaginable, now appear'd fully &s;a|tisfied
in his Mind, and no longer Con&s;cience &s;eem'd
to fly in his Face, but he became full of Mirth and Jol|l$$ry.
So, by the Captain's Order, I chri&s;ten'd the
Child in a very decent Manner; the Captain and Lieu|t$$aet
&s;tood Godfathers, and <HI>Elizabeth</HI> Godmother.
When the Ceremony was over, the Captain &s;aid, <HI>Tom,</HI>
as this Child was begot and born, and I its Godfather,
on Board of my Ship, and as it is now a Chiri&s;tian,
I think it properly belongs to me (tho' I am not the
Father of it) to &s;ee it brought up in a Chri&s;tian
Manner, which, if it plea&s;e God to ble&s;s me with
Life, I will &s;ee perform'd; and not only that, but
will take Care of it, if it lives, during my Life, and
&s;ee it well educated. So the Captain order'd Half
a Goat to be roa&s;ted, and he, the Lieutenant, and I,
with <HI>Tom</HI> and <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> whom he permitted on that
Occa&s;ion, &s;upp'd at his Table, and was very merry,
which &s;o rejoyced <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> that &s;he, immediately
after Supper related what had happen'd to her Fel|low
<HI>Negroe</HI> Woman, who was called <HI>Antiope,</HI> and
they both went to <HI>Juno,</HI> and told that her Son was
baptized a Chri&s;tian, by the Name of <HI>Thomas.</HI></P>
<P>The Weather here was extreamly hot in the
Day Time, but cold Dews at Night, which was
very dangerous for our Men; for three died in our
Voyage to the <HI>Gallapagoes.</HI></P>
<P>As we &s;ailed, on the twenty fifth at Night, the
Sea very much &s;urpriz'd us, &s;eeming as red as Blood,
which occa&s;ioned <HI>Stephen Jones,</HI> who was upon the
Watch with &s;ome others, to call us up, for they had
never &s;een the like before: When we came upon
Deck, we &s;uppos'd it to be a great Quantity of
<PB N="56" REF="68">
Spawn of Fi&s;h, &s;wiming on the Water, it being ve|ry
fair. Having pa&s;s'd the Line, we made the <HI>Gal|liapagoes</HI>
on the filth of <HI>July,</HI> where we anchor'd a|bout
a Mile off the Shore, in a good &s;mooth &s;andy
Ground: We &s;ent our Boat on Shore for Water,
but could find none: Some of our Men began to
be &s;ick, but none of them died, before we arriv'd a$
<HI>Puna</HI> I&s;le in <HI>Peru,</HI> from whence we &s;ail'd a little
Way up the River <HI>Guiaquill,</HI> where we &s;aw many
<HI>Alligators,</HI> and &s;old &s;ome of our Goods; but the$
<HI>Spaniards</HI> being jealous that we came as Spies, and
belong'd to &s;ome other Ships on that Coa&s;t, that
were <HI>Buckaniers.</HI> We thought be&s;t to leave that
Place, having taken in &s;ome fre&s;h Water, and a few
Provi&s;ions, to &s;erve us to the I&s;le of <HI>Lobos.</HI> We
&s;tood out to Sea, and made the I&s;land <HI>St. Claca$</HI>
where we anchor'd on the tenth; for that Nigh$
(our Ship proving crank, and &s;ailing very heavy; $word$
the next Morning, when we was prepairing to &s;ail$
we found our Ship had &s;prung a Lake; &s;o that $word$
were oblig'd to have one Hand at the Pomp contin|ually.
Before we had &s;ail'd &s;ix Leagues, the Win$
fre&s;hen'd upon us, and the Sky look'd extraordinary
black, at North-Ea&s;t, and mov'd towards us, tha$
made us take in our Top&s;ails, and afterwards to
rief our Main&s;ail, and Mizen; at which Time it be|gan
to rain, and pour'd down, as if through a Sive:
the Sea &s;eem'd as if it had been all on Fire, by the
prodigious Thunder and Lightning. (It then being
Night,) the Elements over Head look'd mo&s;t di&s;|mally
black, but all round the Horizon, as red as
Blood, the Waves, that &s;eem'd to da&s;h again&s;t
the Clouds, by the Wind, &s;parkled like Lightning,
which, together with the Thunder, made a mo&s;t
terrible Noi&s;e. At la&s;t, breaking in upon our Deck,
carried away one of our Anchors; and we dur&s;t
not bring our Ship to the Wind, for Fear of her
<PB N="57" REF="69">
Foundering, it being dangerous in a Storm to turn
a Ship backward and forward; &s;o were obliged to
$ly in the Trough of the Sea: But the Wind and
Rain abating, we ob&s;erv'd, to our great Joy, a <HI>Cor|pus
Sanct</HI> at the Top of our Spindle: The&s;e <HI>Corpus
Sanct's</HI> are good Signs, when &s;een aloft, but a bad O|men,
and denotes a great Storm, when &s;een on our
Decks. It is a &s;mall glimmering Light like a Star,
when aloft, but, when on the Deck, appears like a
Glow-Worm. It is the Opinion of Mariners, that
it is a Sort of a Jelly, incorporated by the Wind,
Rain, and Sea Vapours, and Air, becau&s;e it is never
ob&s;erv'd, unle&s;s in &s;tormy Weather.</P>
<P>We &s;ailed right before the Wind, which was
South-we&s;t, but were continually oblig'd to keep
Pumping, till the eighteenth Day, when we made
the I&s;le of <HI>Lobos,</HI> about 12 at Noon. That Night
we got well into the Harbour, and anchor'd at
twenty Fathom Water, in clean Ground, between
the two I&s;lands. Here we re&s;olv'd to careen our
Ship; accordingly, ob&s;erving the Time of high
Water, we put her into a Cove, in the &s;outher|mo&s;t
I&s;land, where we hall'd her up as far as we
could on the Land, and our Carpenter and all Hands
&s;et to work the next Day. The I&s;land is barren,
and without fre&s;h Water. Here we kill'd &s;everal
Seals, Sea Lyons, Boobies and Penguins, a Sea-Foul
about as big as a Duck, who&s;e Fle&s;h is very
ordinary Food, but their Eggs extremely good.
Here al&s;o we found a &s;mall black Fowl, that makes
Holes in the Ground to roo&s;t in at Nights, who&s;e
Fle&s;h is very good, and a great many Vultures and
Crows. We had careen'd our Ships, and in a
readine&s;s to &s;ail on the twenty &s;ixth, and &s;ail'd for
the I&s;le <HI>Fernandos,</HI> and made the middle Bay on the
&s;eventh of <HI>Augu&s;t; Winter</HI> being ju&s;t over there,
which contiues only two Months, <HI>viz. June</HI> and <HI>July</HI>

have been lefr or ca&s;t away, and that have liv'd
&s;ometime, and very well on this I&s;land: Here,
we mended our Sails; there is plenty of Fi&s;h of
diver&s;e Sorts very good, it is very plea&s;ant on
Shore, and very healthy; &s;o that the Men who had
been ill in our Voyage, perfectly recover'd their
Healths, for the green <HI>Piamento</HI> Trees ca&s;t a very
agreeable and refre&s;hing healthy Smell over the
I&s;land: Here we &s;pent &s;ome Time in taking Wood
on Board, and likewi&s;e in laying Water up, which
is very good al&s;o, boil'd up a con&s;iderable Quanti|ty
of Sea-Lyons, of which there is Plenty here;
we had al&s;o plenty of young Seals, which eat very
well, only their Liver is unwhole&s;ome; and at the
&s;outh End of the I&s;land, we found &s;ome Goats, of
which we kill'd about thirty, which were excellent|ly
good, here was al&s;o plenty of Turnips and Water-Cre&s;&s;es,
which did us great Service on account of
the Scurvey, and of which we gather'd a pretty
large Quantity.</P>
<P>So having refre&s;h'd our&s;elves very well on this
I&s;land, we re&s;olv'd to &s;teer &s;or <HI>Cape Verde</HI> in <HI>Chili</HI>
on the twelfth, made the I&s;land of St. <HI>Jago,</HI> where
we anchor'd, and &s;ent our Boat on S$ore, $here
we bought &s;ome Hogs and black Cattle (for our
Voyage round <HI>Cape Horn</HI> to the <HI>Brazils)</HI> as al&s;o
&s;ome Corn and Maize: Here the People by the
ill U&s;age they have formerly met with from the
<HI>French,</HI> are extremely &s;harp, and really di&s;hhone&s;t,
for if they trade with you, and cannot get the Ad|vantage
of you that they think you would have of
them, will &s;natch your Goods, and run away
from you.</P>
<P>We weigh'd Anchor on the Twentieth, and
&s;ail'd from hence round <HI>Cape Horn</HI> in 51 Degreet 15
Minuts as our Pilot inform'd me, I being only a
Merchant on Board, and therefore do not pretend
<PB N="59" REF="73">
to take a methodical Journal, only as I promi&s;ed to
give an Account of the mo&s;t material Pa&s;&s;ages in
our Voyage Home. Round the <HI>Cape</HI> the Weather
favour'd us extremely, and nothing happen'd ma|terial,
only that we were chaced by a Pyrate-Ship
for about twelve Hours on the twenty ninth,
but Night coming on, favour'd us, &s;o that we lo&s;t
her, on the fourth of <HI>September</HI> we made <HI>Faulkland</HI>'s
I&s;land; here we &s;aw a great Number of Porpu&s;es
that often leap'd out of the Water of an uncom|mon
Sort; on the fifth, we had the Misfortune
to have one of our Men fall into the Sea, as he
was throwing the Lead, and was drown'd before
we could give him any Help: We had very brisk
Gales at &s;outh we&s;t, we &s;ail'd and made <HI>Cape St.
Antonio</HI> near the Mouth of the River <HI>De la Plata</HI> in
<HI>Paragua,</HI> on the twenty fifth, Wind &s;outh and by
we&s;t, when we &s;tood out to Sea, and made the
I&s;le of <HI>Grande</HI> on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Brazile</HI> on the twenty

in any Place, with le&s;s than ten Fathom Water;
the I&s;land is about nine Leagues long, high Land,
near the Water-&s;ide, it abounds with Wood, the
I&s;land has Monkeys and other wild Bea&s;t, plenty
of good Timber, and good Water, Oranges, and
Lemons, we had fine plea&s;ant Weather, but ex|tremely
hot: Here we got Beef, Mutton, Hogs,

now &s;poken, and (by his living without any Con|ver&s;ation
&s;o great a Time) had made him in &s;ome
mea&s;ure forget his own Mother-Tongue; tho' I really
think, taking that into Con&s;ideration, his Account
was very polite; yet had his Life been publi&s;h'd as
in his Memoirs, it would have appear'd very ob|&s;olete
and difficult to be read, tho' never &s;o enter|taining;
I accordingly collected all the Pa&s;&s;ages of
his fir&s;t twenty eight Years together, and thought
proper to make a Book or Part by them&s;elves, that
Part of his Life being different from his hermitical
Confinement on the I&s;land, which at fir&s;t Sight,
appear'd &s;o full of Horrour, and nothing but a
Pro&s;pect of the mo&s;t mi&s;erable Condition that could
befal him: He no &s;ooner look'd round him, and
depending upon Providence as Supporter of the di|&s;tre&s;&s;ed,
but he found almo&s;t every thing nece&s;&s;ary for
humane Life on that &s;mall I&s;land; and he who then
thought of nothing but immediately peri&s;hing in
the mo&s;t mi&s;erable&s;t Condition, has liv'd, by the
Help of divine Providence, in a &s;afe and plentiful
manner, and is now &s;o innured thereunto, that he
de&s;pi&s;es the popular World and its Vanities, al&s;o
con&s;iders its pompuous Glory to be of no more
Sub&s;tance than a Shadow, and that there is no Fe|licity
on Earth, unle&s;s in Solitude.</P>
<P>I likewi&s;e methodized his Account during his
Re&s;idence on the I&s;land, in the former manner, and
<PB N="61" REF="75">
made another Book or part, which with this Ac|count
of my finding him on the I&s;land, and my
Conference with him, completes my De&s;ign, &s;o that
it cannot be called an imperfect De&s;cription, but com|plete
in three Books; &s;o I return to my Voyage.</P>
<P>In our Pa&s;&s;age from <HI>Juan Fernandes,</HI> we &s;aw a

&s;pread their Wings from eight to ten Foot wide,
in the <HI>Braziles</HI> is a Serpent called <HI>Liboya,</HI> or the
Roe-buck Serpent, the Report of which is incredible
(in my Opinion) but affirm'd by &s;ome of the
<HI>Portugue&s;e, viz.</HI> that there are &s;ome of them thirty
Foot long, its Body being as big as a Hog&s;head,
and de&s;troys a Roe-buck at one Meal; here we traf|fick'd
for &s;everal Sorts of Drugs, we treated the
<HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> very civilly, who &s;upply'd us with all
Things nece&s;&s;ary for our U&s;e: During our Stay
here, there arriv'd a Brigantine laden with Negroes
for the Gold-Mines; here four of our Men died,
and three run away from us, the la&s;t of which we
had Occa&s;ion to be thankful rather than &s;orry; for <HI>Ty|mothy
Anchors</HI> overheard them di&s;cour&s;ing with De|&s;ign
to Mutiny at our next &s;ailing, but was doubt|ful
whether or no they might get enough on their &s;ide
to over-power the Captain and his Party; and agreeing
among them&s;elves, that it was a Matter very difficult
to become Ma&s;ters of the Ship, and be&s;ides con&s;idering
the Hazard they run, in being puni&s;h'd after &s;uch a
&s;evere Manner as they &s;hould be, if found out by
any means before they could accompli&s;h their De&s;ign
or if they &s;hould fail in their Attempt, made them ra|ther
chu&s;e to de&s;ert from the Ship, than continue any
longer; tho' our Captain was an extraordinary good
Man, yet Rogues will be always employing their
wicked Contrivances, and neither Clemency nor
good U&s;age can make them perform their Duty in
their Station.</P>

an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Boy of about &s;ixteen Years of Age, who
had been fretting the creature with a &s;mall Rope
which he made a Noo&s;e to, and &s;lipt her hind Leg

bearing North-ea&s;t, di&s;tant about &s;even Leagues,
&s;mooth Water and fre&s;h Galles. About Four a

prodigious Quantity of Salt, that is naturally con|geal'd
in Salt-ponds. There are &s;ome poor Goats
on this I&s;land, and &s;ome wild Fowl; here are Flam|ingoes,
a large Fowl much like a Heron, but big|ger
and of a reddi&s;h Colour: They feed together
in muddy Ponds, or where there is little Water:
They are hard to &s;hoot, as being very &s;hy.</P>
<P>In St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> we traded with &s;ome of the <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
for Ambergreece; but they were very fraudu|lent,
having very much counterfeited it. Here are

<P>While we was at this I&s;land we &s;crub'd our

we got &s;ome Water. Here an ugly Accident had
like to have happen'd, for one of our Men going
down into the Hold with a Candle, &s;et Fire to a
Bale of Cotton, which, by his Carle&s;&s;ne&s;s, had like
to have been the Lo&s;s of our Ship; but (Thanks

it in mind for our Safety.</P>
<P>On the Eighth we went to the I&s;le of <HI>Mayo,</HI> ano|ther

of the I&s;land St. <HI>Nicholas)</HI> that live at the Foot of
the Mountain, near the Sea: There is al&s;o Cocoa
Nuts, Plantins, Goats and Fowls.</P>
<P>In the I&s;land St. <HI>Aritanio,</HI> another of the <HI>Cape-Verd</HI>

the &s;ame <HI>Portugueze)</HI> very large, that weaves its
Web between the Trees, which is &s;o &s;trong, that it
is difficult for a Man to get through them: Here
are al&s;o wild A&s;&s;es; likewi&s;e here are Salt-Pits,
where great Quantities of Salt is naturally made by
the Sun's Heat; with which they load yearly &s;e|veral
Ships, and are able to &s;ell much greater Quan|tities
than they do, if they had but Vent for it.</P>
<P>Having di&s;patch'd our Affairs at the <HI>Cape-Verd</HI>
I&s;lands, we weigh'd with the Flood, having a &s;mall
Gale at South-&s;outh-we&s;t and by South. On the
17th it began to blow, and verr'd to the South-we&s;t
and by South: That Evening we &s;aw three Sail, at
We&s;t-north-we&s;t, bearing, as we &s;uppos'd, for the

coming on, which was extreamly clear and fine,
we pa&s;s'd the Tropick about the Break of Day:
Soon after which we ob&s;erv'd a North Bank lying
in the Horizon;, we provided for a Storm, which
tho&s;e Clouds denote; the Wind was at North-north-we&s;t:

We brought our Ship under our Main-&s;ail

that we beat up and down with only our bare Poles,
which we fear'd would break in upon our Deck, which
mu&s;t have founder'd us, in ca&s;e it had happen'd;
we al&s;o lower'd our Main-yard and Fore-yard down
a Port-la&s;t, as I ob&s;erv'd the Sailors call'd it, that is
pretty near the Deck; and the Wind blew extreamly
fierce, &s;o that we did not dare to loo&s;e any Head-&s;ai$

blown away. During the Storm it rain'd exce&s;&s;ive
fa&s;t, which continu'd for about four Hours, when
it chang'd, and was pretty calm, and we began to get
every thing in good Order. The Wind that Even|ing

Water, black &s;limy Ground, about half a Mile from

<P>Poor <HI>Phill.</HI> who had conceiv'd a Notion that

more ea&s;y, he con&s;ults the Ma&s;ter's Nature and
Temper, rather than the Goodne&s;s and Profitable|ne&s;s

a Lock&s;mith, ever &s;ince he was born,

<P>His Landlady, who till then had been made to
expect her Money, thinking he only waited the

him in that Hope-killing Dre&s;s, gave a Screek
as if &s;he had &s;een the Devil, &s;landers and abu&s;es &s;tri|ving

and like a rapid Torrent, which runs from a large

&s;tood like one bereft of her Sen&s;es; &s;o having
$orn her Head-Cloathes off of her Head, with Words
$uitable to the barbarous Deeds, &s;he thru&s;ts them
both out of Doors; which, tho' the rude&s;t Action
that could denote the Unmercifulne&s;s of her intend|ed

<P>That unexpected Treatment was no &s;mall Check

that one Time or other he mu&s;t have &s;tood
the Shock, he rejoyces, 'tis over; &s;o, being free from
the Care of getting her paid, he has at that Time
nothing to think of but to find another Lodging;
which being then too late to go about, he con|cludes
to wait for Morning at a certain Celler at
<HI>Charing-Cro&s;s,</HI> which is open all Night. Going a|long
&s;he mildly blam'd him for his unadvis'd com|ing
in that Dre&s;s, which he might imagin could
produce no better Effect. To which he an&s;wer'd,
He never could have wi&s;h'd for better; for by her
turning him out of Doors, &s;he had paid her &s;elf,
which he would have done had he &s;taid; but now
he was come away, being better provided, and in a
better Way, he would have better Lodging: So told
her of the Adventure, which much rejoic'd her;
and from that Time made her re&s;olve to for&s;ake her
former Way of Living, which Misfortunes only
drove her to, being not led by evil Inclination $word$
many are. The Morning being come, whil&s;t &s;he
went to &s;eek for Lodging, he went for the Cloathes
he was promis'd the Evening before, which hap|pen'd
to fit him, as if made on Purpo&s;e; which
made him appear as one of the genteel Employment
he was recommended for. Being new &s;hav'd and
powder'd, he went with the Letter, according to Or|ders,
and was received &s;uitably to the Recommen|dation:
The Lady, being but ju&s;t up, made him
drink Chocolate with her; then, having requir'd
a Song, &s;he agrees with him for a Guinea a Month,
the u&s;ual Rate; and gives him a Guinea at Entrance,
as 'tis common: So did begin that very Morning,
promi&s;ing to recommend him to a Lady who had
<PB N="89" REF="103">
two Daughters, which &s;he accordingly did, and
&s;ent him there the next Time he came.</P>
<P>This fair Pro&s;pect of a hand&s;ome and genteel Li|ving,
of which he always was de&s;irous, made him
forget his pa&s;t Misfortunes: Thus joyfully he re|turns
to the Celler, where he had &s;pent the Night
before, and where he had appointed to meet his
Wife, after that &s;he had fix'd upon a Lodging; who
accordingly came in le&s;s than a Quarter of an Hour,
hoping &s;he had plea&s;ed her Husband, which &s;he re|&s;olv'd
for the future to endeavour; &s;he &s;at down
expecting his coming, not knowing he had already
waited hers; his Change of Dre&s;s concealing him
from her, not expecting to &s;ee him in &s;o different a
Garb, from that which &s;he left him in; which he
perceiving, comes up to her, and takes her by the
Hand, going to ask her the Succe&s;s of her Walk; but
&s;he putting it out of his Power, in an angry Manner,
bidding him to go about his Bu&s;ine&s;s, having none
with her, prevented his Speaking: His Silence which
&s;he took to proceed from Ba&s;hfulne&s;s, occa&s;ion'd her
looking him in the Face, in which di&s;covering her
dear Husband's Features, to who&s;e natural Hand|&s;omene&s;s,
his genteel Cloathes were no &s;mall Additi|on:
She was &s;eiz'd with &s;uch a Surprize, that it
&s;truck her &s;peechle&s;s for &s;ome Minutes.</P>
<P><HI>Quarll</HI> di&s;cerning her Di&s;order by the fading of
her fre&s;h Complexion, was as much &s;urpriz'd as &s;he.
Thus trembling, he takes her in his Arms. My
Dear, &s;aid he, what's the Matter, are you not well?
Having recovered her Speech &s;he embraceth him,
&s;aying, how can I be ill, and my dear Heart and
Soul appear &s;o Well.</P>
<P>The&s;e kind Words, and the Return of that Flu&s;h,
is fir&s;t kindled Love's Fire in her Heart, inflames $t
a-fre&s;h: Hardly can he govern his new-rais'd Pa&s;|&s;ion,
it begins to grow ab&s;trepolous. Thus, giving
<PB N="90" REF="104">
her a Ki&s;s; My Love, &s;ays he, have you got me a
Lodging? Yes, my Dear, replies the loving Wife,
you &s;hall ever dwell in my Heart; but I want to lie
in your Arms. An&s;wers he, that can't be done
here. Well then, &s;aid &s;he, I have provided a fit
Place. So, having each of them taken a Dram,
they went away.</P>
<P><HI>Sally,</HI> who till then was a Stranger to real Love,

bears his Image in her Heart, and wi&s;hes &s;he could
for ever have him in her Arms, which from that
Time, &s;he con&s;ecrates to cha&s;te Embraces, devoting
her&s;elf wholly to the diligent and a&s;&s;iduous Practice
of the nece&s;&s;ary Qualifications in a Wife, to render
a Husband truly happy: The Execution of which,
her wi&s;e and virtuous Re&s;olutions, did gain her the

the Neatne&s;s of her Lodging, which &s;he did
keep in the greate&s;t Order. As &s;he was going, &s;he
mo&s;t unfortunately meet with the perjur'd Knight,
who deceiv'd her out of her Virtue, and with whom
&s;he had liv'd a con&s;iderable Time, in Expectation of

evil Life, which &s;he mortally did abhore, and zea|lou&s;ly
renounc'd: But inexecrable Fate has decreed
her Ruin, &s;he can no wi&s;e avoid him; he was too
near before &s;he perceiv'd him, and had hold of her
Hand, e're &s;he could &s;hift it out of his Way.</P>
<P>Being thus &s;uddenly &s;top'd by him &s;he would
have imbrac'd the &s;evere&s;t Death to avoid the
vile &s;uborner, by whom her Innocence was fir&s;t
betray'd, the irreconciliable Antipathy &s;he had
conceiv'd for the mortal Enemy of her newly re|treev'd

<P>The amourous Knight who&s;e late Love for the

damag'd, being reviv'd and grown more pa&s;&s;ionate

that her pre&s;ent di&s;order did proceed from Joy
and Surprize, took the Opportunity of an empty
Hackney Coach that was going by, to bring her to
his Lodgings. So having &s;topt it, he puts the
poor di&s;pirited Woman, altogether un&s;en&s;ible of
what was done or de&s;ign'd: But having with the
&s;haking of the Coach recover'd a little Spirit;
<PB N="92" REF="106">
finding her&s;elf &s;o much in his Power, as aim'd at

out of the Coach, he tells the People that &s;tood
by, his Wife, who had been lately over&s;et, was a|fraid
of the like Accident, made her &s;cream; &s;o
bid the Coachman drive on, during which time he
entertains her with all the Marks of a pa&s;&s;ionate

for ever, and that now kind Fortune once more
brought 'em together none but Death &s;hall &s;ever
him from the Per&s;on he lov'd &s;o dear, and that
he would expire in tho&s;e &s;oft Arms that often
gave him Life.</P>
<P>The&s;e fond Expre&s;&s;ions &s;he formerly had given
Credit to, are now Upbraidings and Reproaches

&s;he thought proper to conceal; thus re&s;training
her Pa&s;&s;ion, &s;he a&s;&s;umes a feing'd Calmne&s;s, and
mildly returns him Thanks for his Love, which
&s;he cannot indulge being marryed. Marry'd, &s;aid

in it and a Doctor &s;ent for. Who, having felt
her mo&s;t di&s;order'd Pul&s;e, &s;aid her Indipo&s;ition
did proceed from Pa&s;&s;ion and Grief, &s;o order'd &s;he
might be let Blood, which would give her oppre&s;s'd
Spirits a pre&s;ent Relief, the Phy&s;ician was no &s;oon|er
gone but that the Surgeon was fetcht, to per|form
the Doctor's Orders, which gave her imme|diate
Ea&s;e, and in a little time caus'd her to
&s;leep, which la&s;ted all the Night.</P>
<P>This great and &s;udden Amendment much re|joyc'd
the mo&s;t afflicted Knight, who made a Vow
not to leave her till re&s;tor'd to her wonted Health,
&s;o &s;at up by her all Night.</P>
<P>The next morning, <HI>Sally,</HI> who&s;e good Night's
Re&s;t had in a great mea&s;ure recover'd both Strength
and Rea&s;on, finding her&s;elf in a &s;trange Bed and
from her Husband, was again &s;eiz'd with Surpri&s;e,
which did much threaten a Relap&s;e. Heavens,
&s;aid &s;he, by what Enchantment am I here! What
Fiends could ravi&s;h me out of my dear Spou&s;e's
<PB N="95" REF="109">
Arms? then &s;eeing the Knight &s;tand by the Bed|&s;ide,
&s;he gives a loud Screek; oh! vile Ravi&s;her,
&s;aid &s;he, is it then by another of your Helli&s;h
Stratagems, that I am again betray'd in your
Power? With that &s;he fell in a violent Fit of
Crying: No, mo&s;t vertuous Woman replyes the
Knight, falling on his Knees, it is by Accident, of
which I own my &s;elf to be the mo&s;t mi&s;erable
Occa&s;ion, for which I heartily ask both Heaven
and you Pardon, &s;o relates the whole Matter,
which the late Illne&s;s her exce&s;&s;ive Grief and Pa&s;|&s;ion
brought upon her, had made her forget.</P>
<P>That woful Relation did but add to her
Trouble, by hightning her Grief; oh! &s;aid &s;he, with
a fre&s;h Showr of Tears, how can I now look my
dear Husband in the Face when my very Ju&s;ti|fication
turns to my Shame.</P>
<P>The Knight, who was in as great a Con|&s;ternation
as &s;he could be in takes her Hand,
which lay motionle&s;s out of the Bed, and bathing
on't with Tears, beggs her to forbear terrifying
his mo&s;t penitent Soul; promi&s;ig to rectify all
pa&s;t Wrongs: You remember, my Life, &s;aid he, the
Vows I made when fir&s;t you gave your &s;elf to
me? I renew them now, and would fullfil them,
but that it would expo&s;e you to the Rigour of
the Law, therefore I'll only for the pre&s;ent &s;ettle
five hundred Pounds a Year upon you for your
Life, till by your Husband's Death, I am impower'd
to make you lawful Mi&s;tre&s;s of all my E&s;tate;
pray compo&s;e your &s;elf, and &s;edately con&s;ider on't,
and when come to a Conclu&s;ion I'll attend for
your An&s;wer; &s;o withdrew for a while.</P>
<P>This generous Offer expre&s;&s;ing the Sincerity of
his Love, for whom &s;he formerly had more than
a common E&s;team, in a great Mea&s;ure appeas'd
her Pa&s;&s;ion, the offer'd Attonement di&s;arms her
<PB N="96" REF="110">
Revenge, &s;he now pleads for him &s;he before did
condemn, and blames her&s;elf for the Crime &s;he
charg'd him with; how could, I &s;aid &s;he, think my
Virtue &s;afe in his Hands, on whom Love has &s;uch
an a&s;cendent, (who it &s;elf is guilty of as many
Faults as it covers) If he went away with my
Heart it was but a Breach of Tru&s;t: Be&s;ides, his Ab|&s;ence
whas no Flight, being occa&s;ion'd by Bu|&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Having made the&s;e reconcilable Reflections, and
at the Point of accepting his Offer, Con&s;cience
&s;tarts, and oppos'd her Re&s;olution, her Husband
&s;tands in the way rigg'd in all tho&s;e engaging Qua|lifications
which did win her Affection; this com|ing
into her Mind, in a manner &s;cares away her
Rea&s;on, &s;he can't help loving both; her Love for
the Knight pleads Seniority, and that for her Hus|band
Ju&s;tice. The fir&s;t is attended with Intere&s;t,
the la&s;t is prompted by Virtue; the Debate is great,
and both their Arguments &s;trong: Rea&s;on is call'd
to decide the Matter, which having (as 'tis her Cu|&s;tom)
&s;edately weigh'd the Cau&s;e, examin'd both Ac|cidents
and Incidents, at la&s;t &s;eems inclinable to fa|vour
the Love for the Knight; but Ju&s;tice, who
is always in the Right, will not re&s;ign it: Peace
and Content, the only Motives worth contending
for, mu&s;t be con&s;ulted, they being al&s;o cautious of
giving a ra&s;h Verdict, examin'd on which Side they
were in mo&s;t Safety; and finding them&s;elves mo&s;t
&s;creen'd from Upbraidings and Reproaches, (their
mortal Enemies) for the Knight, gave it of his
Side; So Ju&s;tice, who &s;eldom gets its due, is
forc'd to drop the Cau&s;e, and tacitely with|draw.</P>
<P>The Knight's Offer being the &s;ofte&s;t Choice
for an ea&s;y and quiet Life, which &s;he could not
rea&s;onably expect with her Husband, who doubt|le&s;s
<PB N="97" REF="111">
would from the late Accident, conceive an ill
Opinion of her Virtue; which, altho' at that Time
blamele&s;s, &s;he could not with Mode&s;ty vindicate:
So, having &s;ent for the Knight, &s;he &s;peaks to him af|ter
this Manner.</P>
<P>I have had &s;o much Rea&s;on to repent my being
too credulous, by the many Vexations it has occa|&s;ioned
me, now, that I &s;hould upon the bare
repeating of broken Promi&s;es, expo&s;e my &s;elf to the

I own you have &s;ufficient Cau&s;e to que&s;tion my Sin|cerity,
but I will this Moment remove it: So that
Moment &s;ends for a Lawyer, and makes the pro|pos'd
Settlement; then gives Orders a Mercer

the mo&s;t modi&s;h Silks, and then for a Silk Night-Gown,
for her to wear till her Clothes were made;

Then, having new rigg'd her from Top to
Toe, Now, &s;aid he, my Dear you are entierly mine,

<LETTER>

</LETTER>
<P>Having &s;eal'd up the Letter, and bundled up the
Cloathes, a Porter was call'd, to whom Orders was
given to carry the Bundle and Letter, to the mo&s;t
perplex'd and concern'd <HI>Quarll,</HI> who &s;pent the
Night in an un&s;peakable Torment. A thou&s;and
<PB N="98" REF="112">
di&s;mal Accidents glear'd at his alarm'd Fancy&punc;
which created new Racks for his tortur'd Soul. He
tumbles on his Bed, like an unma&s;ted Ship, to&s;s'd
about by a violent Storm; cur&s;ing the tedious
Hours, for creeping thus in the dark Night; tax|ing
the Sun with Sloth, and Nature with Unkind|ne&s;s.
Thus, like one bereft of his Sen&s;es, and
quite void of Rea&s;on, &s;narles at the whole Crea|tion.</P>
<P>At length the long wi&s;h'd for Day, having &s;ent
forth its Dawn, to proclaim its Approach, he &s;tarts
from off his Bed whereon he lay, as if upon Thorns,
and mad-like, runs about to inform him&s;elf of what
he dreads more than Death to know: But having
&s;pent &s;everal Hours in diligent Enquiry after lately
befallen Accidents, without hearing of any, Jealo&s;ie
creeps in, which, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, removes his
former Fears, but no wi&s;e le&s;&s;ens his Pains: Thus
he returns Home as much rack'd as before.</P>
<P>Being arriv'd, he finds on his Table a Bundle and
a Letter, which his Landlady told him were brought
by a Porter. His Impatience to know the
Contents of both was equal; but the Bundle being
mo&s;t &s;urprizing to him, he precipitately opens it
fir&s;t, which, finding to be every individual Part of the
Cloathes, his Wife had on the Day before, when
&s;he went out. With the Surprize, lets it drop out
of his Hands, and like one Thunder-&s;truck, re|mains
&s;peechle&s;s for &s;everal Minutes; then &s;e$ching
a deep and heavy Sigh attended with a Shower of
Tears, he bitterly exclaims again&s;t him&s;elf for que|&s;tioning
the Faithfulne&s;s of that Love, of which he
now has &s;uch fatal Proofs.</P>
<P>Thus, concluding &s;he had drown'd her&s;elf, and
that the Letter would inform him of the cau&s;e there|of.
He takes it up, &s;aying, O that thou had&s;t been a
timely Forerunner of the fatal Tidings thou art
<PB N="99" REF="113">
Bearer of: Yet, for her dear Sake that wrote it, I'll
peru&s;e thee, tho' thy Contents be but Racks for me,
and the mo&s;t cruel Tortures that ever were or can
be invented.</P>
<P>But great was his Surprize when he found it
to come from a man, and inexpre&s;&s;ible his Con|fu&s;ion
at the Contents; his Sen&s;es are all in an Up|roar;
he blames his Eyes for not &s;eeing right; his
Apprehen&s;ion for mi&s;taking the Meaning; his blind
Love taxes his Rea&s;on with Ra&s;hne&s;s: The mi|&s;taken
Expre&s;&s;ions being but Illu&s;ions proceeding
from an Oppre&s;&s;ion upon the Intellects. So lays
down the Letter, till his di&s;turb'd Mind was better
&s;ettled; yet he cannot be ea&s;y, he mu&s;t, with &s;ome
other Writing, try whether his Eyes are &s;till de|fective;
on which finding no Fault, he ha&s;tily takes
up the Letter again, but alas! it was the &s;ame as
before. My Judgment, &s;aid he, has been as much
wrong'd as my Love. So, after few Con&s;iderati|ons,
calling to Mind, that as an Accident had pro|cur'd
her to him, he ought, without Reluctancy, to
&s;urrender her up to it again; &s;o, having made a
Re&s;olution never to venture any more on that un|certain
State, which commonly promi&s;es Happi|ne&s;s,
but often brings Sorrow; he &s;hifts his Lodg|ing,
and goes to live where he was unknown, the
better to pa&s;s for a Batchelor; in which free Sta|tion
he did enjoy Peace undi&s;turb'd, and Plea&s;ures
uncontroll'd, for the Space of twelve Months: But
cro&s;s Fate &s;till pur&s;ues him, he mu&s;t again be fet|ter'd,
and bear yet heavier Chains than before. A
&s;econd Mate is allotted him, who, tho' very cha&s;te,
$ooms him wretch'd, being &s;hort of other Qualifi|cations,
nece&s;&s;ary in a Wife to make a Husband
happy.</P>
<P>This Woman had been bred up from her Infan|cy
under the Care of Lady, who&s;e two Daugh|ters
<PB N="100" REF="114">
<HI>Quarll</HI> did teach to &s;ing, and had liv'd with
her in Station of a Chamber-Maid, ever &s;ince &s;he
was big enough to officiate in that Place; during
which Time, having behav'd her&s;elf to her Mi&s;tre&s;s's
Content, &s;he gain'd her Affection, &s;o that this good
Lady, being de&s;irous to advance her Maid, who&s;e
Age fitted her for Marriage, the chief Settlement for
a Woman, &s;he ca&s;t her Eye upon her Daughters
Singing-Ma&s;ter, whom &s;he thought would make her
a good Husband, having ob&s;erv'd him ever &s;ince he
came to her Hou&s;e, to carry and behave him&s;elf ve|ry
decently and becomingly. Thus, having decla|red
her Mind to her, who had already a great In|clination
that Way, readily &s;ubmited to her La|dy's
Will, who promis'd to bring it about.</P>
<P>The good Lady, having conceived the principal
Means to bring her De&s;ign about, took the Op|portunity
of <HI>Quarl</HI>'s next coming, to propo&s;e it $word$
him, promi&s;ing to make her worth three hundred
Pounds, which was the only Motive as could en|gage
him to break the Re&s;olution he had made&punc;
the young Woman being al&s;o very agreeable in $word$
Per&s;on, and extraordinary obliging to him, he rea|dily
accepted the Offer.</P>
<P>The old Lady, having &s;o far prevail'd upon him, $word$
re&s;olv'd to pu&s;h on till quite concluded; &s;o has the$
married in le&s;s than a Week, and gave them Lodg|ing
in her Hou&s;e, where they continued but $word$
Month. The new married Wife thinking her&s;elf
in &s;ome Mea&s;ure under Confinement, whil&s;t in the
good Lady's Hou&s;e, to whom Duty and Gratitude
oblig'd her to be more than indifferently ob&s;erving
being likewi&s;e &s;omewhat ambitious of Living great
&s;he per&s;wades her Husband to take a Hou&s;e at
furni&s;h it; which being done according to her De|&s;ire,
they went away from the kind old Lady $word$

<PB N="101" REF="115">
of Hou&s;e-keeping, which they both till then
had been Strangers to, but in little Time became
too well acquainted with.</P>
<P>The three hundred Pounds being gone in furni&s;h|ing
the Hou&s;e, and paying two Years Rent, and
$s many Years Wages to a couple of Maids, one
whereof &s;he kept in the Station &s;he her&s;elf had
but lately overcome, <HI>Quarll</HI> was oblig'd to reduce
his Charge, and level his Expences to his Income;
&s;o di&s;charges the &s;uperfluous Servant, who&s;e Bu&s;i|ne&s;s
was only to indulge her Indigence, and in|$rea&s;e her Pride.</P>
<P>That &s;udden le&s;&s;ening of her Attendence chec'k
her ambitious Di&s;po&s;ition, in &s;uch a Manner that
$t threw her in the Spleen; which was like to have
$o&s;t him more Money in Doctors, than the Ser|$ant's-Wages
which he endeavour'd to &s;ave.</P>
<P>Being taken very ill, and knowing not what to
$omplain of, a Doctor was granted; at her Impor|$unity,
ratgher than her Need; who being come,
$nd finding her Indi&s;po&s;ition lie in her Temper
more than a defectof Nature, order$d her Medicines
$o make them both in the &s;ame Condition.</P>
<P>Her Strength decaying and the Apothecary's
Bill increa&s;ing, which are the u&s;ual Effects of
maginary Illne&s;s, made her Husband apprehen&s;ive,
$hat con&s;iderable Charges might accrue from her
$ancyful and imaginary Di&s;temper, which he would
$ot indulge, and fear'd to check too &s;uddenly,
$ea&s;t it might produce &s;ome other ill Effects;
$o in Complyance to her natural Pride, he pro|$o&s;es
her going in the Country as being a proper
Expedient to &s;ave his Money, and to be ridd of $word$
grunting Companion, at lea&s;t during the Summer,</P>
<P>This Propo&s;al &s;uiting her Ambition, to imitate
Quality, (who for the Generality did go out of
Town about that time of the Year) was &s;oon ac|cepted
<PB N="102" REF="116">
of; and that Opportunity of being freed from
one of the greate&s;t Plagues as can befal a Man,
by him as &s;oon improv'd.</P>
<P><HI>Quarll</HI> having got her in the Mind, was nowi&s;e
dillatory to get it per&s;otm'd; but made diligent
Enquiry about the mo&s;t convenient Place in the
Country, for Remotene&s;s and Cheapne&s;s; which
being inform'd of, he forthwith takes Hor&s;es, and
having found a good old Country-Man, with his
Wife and Daughter, in <HI>York-Shire</HI> who&s;e diligent
Cares and frugal Living, whil&s;t young and &s;trong,
had been rewarded with a moderate Competence,
to keep him from- Toyling when debilitated and
waxed old; who having a plea&s;ant and como|dious
Habitation di&s;tant from meddling and in|specting
Neighbours, and Room to &s;pare; were
very glad to take in a Gentlewoman to board,
being &s;ome Company for them in their remote Li|ving,
and therefore &s;tood upon no Rate: which
&s;uiting <HI>Quarll</HI>'s Circum&s;tance and Wi&s;hes, made him
con&s;ult on means to keep his Wi&s;e there for a
Con&s;tancy; and as he well knew &s;he never would
con&s;ent, nor he able to force her to't by Violence,
he applies to Stratagems: Thus having given
her the be&s;t Character he could to the old Peo|ple
for good Humour, he tells them, that indeed
&s;he had one Failing, but that it was nowi&s;e
trouble&s;ome, provided one give her her way: &s;he
is very vapouri&s;h and looks for great Attendence.
O dear, that's Quality Di&s;temper; well, if that be
all, reply'd the old Folk, &s;he &s;hall not want for
any one thing. More, &s;aid he, I mu&s;t caution
you of, &s;he will &s;oon be tyr'd of her Lodging,
and will be for returning to <HI>London,</HI> &s;o will &s;eek
all Opportunity to &s;teal away, if &s;he finds her|&s;elf
oppos'd in her De&s;ires; therefore 'tis be&s;t not to
contradict her directly, but be&s;ure watch her nar|rowly,
<PB N="103" REF="117">
lea&s;t &s;he gives you the &s;lip. Never fear,
reply'd the good People, we'll take care of that,
&s;he never &s;hall go one &s;tep alone; &s;he is not apt
to lay violent Hands upon her&s;elf, and do her|&s;elf
a Mi&s;chief? No, no, reply'd he, there's no
Danger of that, you may tru&s;t her alone within
Doors at any time, but never abroad: One thing more
I mu&s;t give you notice of; that is, when &s;he finds
&s;he cannot get away, &s;he'll be for &s;ending Letters,
I charge you let her have no Paper, only at fir&s;t,
to write to me once or twice, or, &s;o; and that
you'll gue&s;s when proper, by her railing, which
will be a token of her being di&s;compos'd: And
as for her Dyet, &s;he is &s;omething dainty, but I
&s;ee you have Poutry plenty, which &s;he loves very
well: O dear Sir, an&s;wer'd the old Woman, &s;he
&s;hall have both Fi&s;h, Fle&s;h, and Fouls, when &s;he
plea&s;es; we have a fine Pond in the Ground well
&s;tock'd with Fi&s;h, and Cocks and Hens enough you
&s;ee about the Yard; and for Butchers Meat, t'is
but two or three hours Ride to the next Town.</P>
<P>So <HI>Quarll</HI> having agreed, and paid one Quarter
before hand, which he promis'd to do whil&s;t &s;he
boarded there, he returns to <HI>London</HI> in order to
fetch his Wife, who having projected a Greatne&s;s
of Living in the Country, which &s;he was di&s;ap|pointed
of in Town: Immediately inquir'd into
the Appearance of the Hou&s;e, the Hand&s;omene&s;s
of the Lodgings, and Gentillity of the Neigh|bours:
To which Que&s;tions <HI>Quarll</HI> took care to
an&s;wer &s;uitable to her Inclination: So having con|cluded
to go the next Day, they went out to
make Provi&s;ion of &s;uch things as cannot well be
had in the Country, as <HI>Nants</HI> Brandy, Ratafie,
U&s;quebaugh, Coffee and Chocolate, and &s;uch things
as were nece&s;&s;ary to entertain genteel Company.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="118">
Being provided with every thing, they &s;et out
the next Day: But as neither Lodgings, Hou&s;e
or Neighbourhood, an&s;wer'd her Ambition, nor
his Commendations, he contriv'd to arrive in the
Night, that &s;he might not find the Deceit, and
as the good People of the Hou&s;e, according to
direction, did &s;hew her abundance of Re&s;pect, gi|ving
her the Title of <HI>Lady;</HI> and a good Supper
being prepar'd, &s;he enquir'd no further into the
matter. The next Morning <HI>Quarll</HI> having repre&s;en|ted
to his Spou&s;e, it would be of prejudice to him
if he &s;tay'd any longer from his Scholars,
having already lo&s;t &s;ix Days, took his Leave of
her, and left her in Bed, it not being her u&s;ual
time to ri&s;e; &s;o having promis'd to be with her
in a &s;hort Time to &s;ee how &s;he lik'd her Lodg|ings,
he return'd to <HI>London,</HI> having fir&s;t re|new'd
his Charge to the good People of the
Hou&s;e, of giving her her Humour, and, above
all, not to let her go out alone, nor con&s;ent to
her coming up to <HI>London,</HI> which in a little time
he que&s;tion'd not but &s;he would be very de&s;irous
of.</P>
<P><HI>Quarll</HI> being gone the old People, according
to their Charge, were extraordinary diligent
and careful in plea&s;ing their new Lodger, who
finding her Ambition gratify'd by their Ob&s;er|vance,
kept in that Day, but the next Morning
having a fancy to walk out, the young Woman
of the Hou&s;e took her to &s;ee the Ground and
Cattle as did belong to them, as being the prin|cipal
Things &s;he could &s;hew her, there being nei|ther
Hou&s;e nor Habitation, but their own little
Cottage, within &s;ight; &s;he, who thought her
Lodging to be in a hand&s;ome and creditable Hou&s;e,
near a genteel Neighbourhood, with whom &s;he might
Conver&s;e, finding the Rever&s;e of her Expectation,
<PB N="105" REF="119">
could not conceal her Pa&s;&s;ion at the Di&s;appoint|ment;
&s;o falls a railing again&s;t her Husband in
&s;uch a Rage, as frightned the poor young Woman,
who doubting &s;he was going in one of her Fits,
run Home to fetch her Father and Mother,
who being come, were as much frightned as their
Daughter at her furious Countenance, the Blood
being ready to &s;tart out of her Face, and her
Eyes out of her Head; thus fearing &s;he would
grow ob&s;trepulous, they each of 'em took hold of
one of her Arms, and &s;o in a manner dragg'd
her Home, where being come they would have
laid her upon the Bed, but &s;he who took this Act
of their Caution, for an Effect of their careful
Attendence, told them, that indeed &s;he could not
find Fault with them, and that their Habitation
might &s;uit their Birth; but really it did not hers,
which her Husband very well knew, and there|fore
never would forgive him for bringing her
there, and that he &s;hould &s;oon know; &s;o de&s;ir'd
them to give her Paper and Ink, if the Hou&s;e
could affor'd &s;uch a thing.</P>
<P>The good People, who had been caution'd to give
her her Humour in that at the Beginning, having
none at home, &s;ent the Boy that attended their

And the rather becau&s;e it gives us very $ively Ideas of the perfect Happine&s;s he enjoys in his Solitude.</NOTE> Now, &s;aid
they, &s;he has been brought up in a City where
Exce&s;s of Plea&s;ure and Luxury are made the

only means to arrive at Content; but alas! how
widely do they mi&s;s their Aim! their Life is a
continued Series of Care; their Emulation and
Vanity in Fa&s;hions, Entertainments, and &s;uch
like, together with that in&s;eparable Companion
Envy, only contribute to make an unhappy
Life &s;till more mi&s;erable. Here this Gentlewo|man
wants for no manner of Nece&s;&s;aries to make
a Life comfortable, but has rather a Superabun|dancy,
could &s;he reject that horrid, pain-cau&s;ing
Quality of Pride, and learn a little Humility,
'tis that brings Content, and &s;weetens all the
Misfortunes of this Life: How preferable is our
Station to hers, how &s;olid is the Plea&s;ure we
enjoy in this &s;olitary Habitation, compar'd to
the trifling Joys the Great Ones po&s;&s;e&s;s in the
mo&s;t populous Cities! O happy Fields and
&s;ilent Groves, where nothing but eternal Rounds
of Plea&s;ure center; here no Debauuches, Riot|ings,
Fa&s;hions and luxurious Entertainments,
no Envy of others good Fortune, no Drunken|ne&s;s,
&s;wearing, and bla&s;pheming the Mercies of
the Almighty God, ever take place as in flou|ri&s;hing
Cities; but Providence gives us all things
with a bountiful Hand; in &s;hort, we have all
we de&s;ire, and more than we ju&s;tly de&s;erve;
here the beauteous Birds, joyfully hopping from
Bough to Bough, &s;tretch their tuneful Throats,
and warble out melodious Anthems to their
great Creator's Prai&s;e, while flow'ry Hills in har|monious
Echos, repeat the &s;ame to the fruitful
neighbouring Vales; here's nothing to be &s;een
or heard but univer&s;al Acclamations of Prai&s;e
to the Great God of all things: This is the real
&s;olid Plea&s;ure; this it is that makes us perfectly
happy; for how much more eligible is the
Company of irrational Animals, or even ina|nimate
<PB N="107" REF="121">
animate things, than the Society of Men, who
have dive&s;ted them&s;elves of all things but Shape,
whereby to di&s;tingui&s;h them from the mo&s;t defor|med
Brutes, or indeed from more horrible De|vils.
This Gentlewoman has put us in Mind of
our own Happine&s;s, of which; before her Com|ing,
we were almo&s;t ignorant; but now we may
&s;ee, that Happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts not in Riches, nor
Content in gaudy Apparel.&mdash;&endq; But why do
we tarry here; it is not proper to leave the Gentle|woman
&s;o long alone, le&s;t, in one of her Fits, &s;he
&s;hould do her &s;elf a Mi&s;chief; therefore let one
of us go to her: So the good Woman of the
Hou&s;e went to her, and finding her in Tears, us'd
all po&s;&s;ible Endeavours to divert her Melancholy;
but all to no purpo&s;e; for &s;till &s;he was interrupted
by Exclamations again&s;t <HI>That Villain! that Rogue!</HI>
her Husband: The good Woman finding that
Words could not prevail, thought a Gla&s;s of
Ratafy might do better, &s;o de&s;ired her to comfort
her &s;elf, and take a Gla&s;s of her Cordial, to which
$he &s;oon con&s;ented, and after that four or five more,
which had the de&s;ired Effect; for her Melancholy
was by this time turn'd into mo&s;t violent Fits of
$he Spleen, and pre&s;ently into Drow&s;ine&s;s; the
Landlady perceiving her Condition, de&s;ir'd her
$o lie down, and refre&s;h her &s;elf by taking a little
Sleep, &s;o laying her down upon her Bed, and
watching her to Sleep, retird.</P>
<P>After &s;he had &s;lept an Hour or two, &s;he awakes
$n a very &s;plenetick Humour, and calls to know the
Rea&s;on why Pen, Ink and Paper were refus'd her,
$ndeed, &s;aid the old Woman, we did not know that
your Lady&s;hip was awake, and we did not care
to di&s;turb you, but I'll bring it you pre&s;ently, &s;o
went and brought it, which &s;he no &s;ooner receiv'd

<P>And with that one, to her Landlord and Landlady,
whom he thanked for their Care of &s;ending the
Letter, but de&s;ired they would not trouble them|&s;elves
with &s;ending any more, nor give her Op|portunity

her Di&s;temper, and above all things to have a par|ticular
Care &s;he &s;hould not give them the Slip, and
he would take care to gratify them for their Trou|ble.</P>
<P>This obliging Letter, together with a Pre&s;ent
of a Pair of hand&s;ome green Stockings, and Lemon
Colour Gloves to the Daughter, did &s;o win the
old Folk's Affection, that they were extream pun|ctual
in ob&s;erving his Orders; but that to his Wife
had a quite different Succe&s;s; for in&s;tead of put|$ing
her into Con&s;ideration, it &s;et her in &s;uch $word$
violent Rage, as would &s;carce permit her to read

<P>The good Woman was not a little di&s;pleas'd to
hear her thus di&s;pi&s;e her Hou&s;e, which was the
be&s;t within a Mile round; but as &s;he imagin'd
it was the Effect of her Vapours, in&s;tead of vindi|cating
her Hou&s;e, which tho' old and low-built,
was tollerable large and very convenient, &s;he
&s;eem'd to acquie&s;ce with her, wi&s;hing it had been
better for her &s;ake; but as for &s;ending to take a
Place, it was then too late; for by that time a
Me&s;&s;enger could be got to Town, the Office
would be &s;hut up; but that the next time &s;he
went out &s;he would take care a Place &s;hould be
taken, &s;o excus'd it for that Week; in the mean
time &s;he gave her her Humour, being very re&s;pect|ful
and ob&s;erving, which &s;uiting her Pride, made
her &s;omething more ea&s;y, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure di|verted
her raving Fits, for &s;he fully depended up|on
going the Week following, but was again di&s;|appointed
by one Mi&s;hap or other, and &s;o from
time time to time; till at la&s;t &s;he begen to doubt
of their giving Orders, meaning to keep her there,
thus re&s;olv'd to go her &s;elf, but not knowing the
way &s;he de&s;ir'd &s;ome body might be &s;ent along
with her, which they were very ready to grant, but
never could be had, being always out of the way
about &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s or other.</P>
<P>This continuing for the Space of a Month or
more, and no News coming from <HI>London,</HI> &s;he be|gan
to think it was a Contrivance of her Hus|band's
to be rid of her, with only paying for her
Board and Lodging, which &s;he under&s;tood he had
done beforehand, and agreed &s;o to do during her
Stay, which very probably might be for her Life;
but re&s;olv'd to di&s;appoint him, by privily &s;tealing
away, and at a venture &s;eek out the Road to the
<PB N="111" REF="125">
next Town, not que&s;tioning but &s;he &s;hould find
&s;ome body as &s;he went that would direct her: But
the old Folk having been warn'd of &s;uch an En|terprize
by her Husband, were too vigilant to give
her an Opportunity of attempting it, never leaving
her by her&s;elf from the time of her getting up to
her going to Bed again, which over Attendance
convinc'd her of her Impri&s;onment.</P>
<P>Thus finding her &s;elf curb'd in her Ambition,
di&s;appointed in her Pride, and trick'd out of her
Liberty, without Hopes of being reliev'd, the Let|ters
&s;he &s;ent to her Friends being intercepted, &s;he
falls into a Pa&s;&s;ion &s;uitable to her Ca&s;e and Di&s;po&s;i|tion,
which having vented upon the People of the
Hou&s;e for abetting and adhearing to her perfidious
Husband in &s;o traiterous a Deed, her Spirits be|ing
exhau&s;ted &s;o prodigiou&s;ly with raving, that no|thing
but a Cordial Dram could ever have brought
them to their u&s;ual Tone, and which &s;he by
long Experience knew; calls for her grand Speci|fick,
and after &s;he had drank three or four refre&s;hing
Gla&s;&s;es, &s;he became more ea&s;y, and retir'd to
Re&s;t; when having &s;lept a few Hours, &s;he awakes
&s;omething better compos'd; thus con&s;idering, that
all the Re&s;entment &s;he was capable to &s;hew could
not mend her Condition; therefore concluded to
make her Landlord and Landlady her Friends, that
$f &s;he did not enjoy her Liberty as &s;he did propo&s;e,
$he might at lea&s;t enjoy a little more Content in her
Confinement.</P>
<P>Thus &s;he re&s;olv'd, and indeed kept her Re&s;olution
$word$ long time, laying a&s;ide her haughty proud Tem|$er,
and curbing tho&s;e violent Pa&s;&s;ions &s;he had &s;o
$ong accu&s;tom'd her&s;elf to; &s;he now began to be
much more familiar, and conde&s;cending than what
he had hitherto &s;hewn, to the great Joy and Sur|$rize
of the good People, who by this &s;trange Al|teration
<PB N="112" REF="126">
were in great Hopes her Madne&s;s was wear|ing
off; and upon that Account were extremely in|du&s;trious
to humour her in every Point, u&s;ing her
with all the good manners they were capable of,
which &s;he ea&s;ily perceiving, thought to make u&s;e
of their Credulity to her Advanntage; for &s;he was
a Woman of quick Penetration, and finding how
egregiou&s;ly tho&s;e ignorant People had been impos'd
upon, in relation to her Frenzy, &s;aw the only means
to regain her Liberty was to pretend a Recovery,
and accordingly, by a counterfeit Change of Tem|per,
endeavour'd to per&s;uade the People into a good
Opinion of her, telling them &s;he could never requite
their extream good Services to her during her Indi&s;|po&s;ition,
and lamenting her own Unhappine&s;s in
being &s;o trouble&s;ome and fatiguing to Per&s;ons of
&s;o kind and obliging Behaviour. They in like
manner an&s;wer'd, that if their poor Services had
contributed any thing to her Ea&s;e or Recovery,
they were &s;ufficiently made amends for all their
Trouble.</P>
<P>Now the Scene was intirely chang'd; the raving
proud, ill-natur'd Gentlewoman became the mo&s;t
plea&s;ant, &s;ociable and be&s;t-natur'd Per&s;on they had
ever met with; and they who ju&s;t before conceiv'd
&s;o great a Di&s;like to her, were now &s;o delighted
with her Company and Conver&s;ation, that &s;he was
le&s;s alone than formerly, they always contriving
&s;ome Diver&s;ion or other to drive away her Melan|choly,
and to prevent a Relap&s;e, hoping to &s;end
the welcome News of her perfect Recovery to her
Husband, frequently plea&s;ing her with odd Country
Tales, &s;hewing her all the Plea&s;ures their Fields,
Gardens, and Orchards could afford, with many
other little Contrivances to pa&s;s the time away,
while &s;he endeavour'd to divert them with the
comical Adventures of the <HI>Londoners.</HI> This &s;he
<PB N="113" REF="127">
endur'd almo&s;t a whole Month, with all the &s;eem|ing
Good-nature, imaginable; but finding her &s;elf
$n no Way to procure her Enlargement, and rather
more &s;trictly guarded than formerly, re&s;olv'd to
obtain her Liberty by Stratagem, which &s;he de&s;ign'd
in the following Manner.</P>
<P>There was a Servant in the Hou&s;e who&s;e Name
was <HI>Thomas,</HI> a lively, brisk, fre&s;h-colour'd young
Man, and indeed a Fellow of admirable Sen&s;e
$nd good Manners. This Spark was of a very a|$orous
Di&s;po&s;ition, well vers'd in Intrigues, and
$xtremely obliging in his Temper and Behaviour,
$ho, as &s;oon as he &s;aw <HI>Quarll</HI>'s Wife, began to
$$ink of his former way of Living. Now this
$oung Fellow was born in <HI>London</HI> of very mean
$arents, who&s;e Friends not being able to give him
$word$ Trade, was oblig'd to enter him&s;elf a Member
$word$ the ancient and honourable Society of Lacqueys:
$is fir&s;t Service was to a Widow Gentlewoman,
$here he learnt all the nece&s;&s;ary Qualifications of
$s Employ, but his Mi&s;tre&s;s being a very religious
Woman, going to Church two or three times every
$ay, where he was oblig'd con&s;tantly to attend her,
$d &s;o much Gravity not &s;uiting his mercurial
$emper, &s;oon oblig'd him to quit his Po&s;t. But
$word$ being an Arch Wag and &s;ly Knave, &s;oon ad|$nc'd
him&s;elf to be Footman to a young No|$man.
Here he began to &s;hew his Genius; for
$word$ Ma&s;ter being a young Gentleman very much
lighted with Love-Adventures, frequently made
$word$ of him in tho&s;e Ca&s;es; and finding him to be
a &s;harp, ready Wit, very careful, and well skill'd
Taciturnity, &s;oon made him &s;ecret Me&s;&s;enger in
$$dinary to all his Intrigues, in which Station he
$av'd him&s;elf admirably well, having all the Ac|$$mpli&s;hments
nece&s;&s;ary for &s;o weighty a Tru&s;t,
Vigilance, Di&s;patch and Secrecy, and the&s;e &s;o
<PB N="114" REF="128">
well manag'd that he &s;eldom fail'd in his De&s;igns:
This Po&s;t of Honour he enjoy'd a long time, with
great Credit and Reputation, and gain'd &s;o great a
Share in his Ma&s;ter's Affections, that he likewi&s;e
made him fir&s;t Mini&s;ter to all his Affairs.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Tom</HI> is arriv'd to the very Summit of his
Fortune, regaling him&s;elf in all kind of Plea&s;ure,
belov'd and tru&s;ted by his Ma&s;ter, honour'd and
re&s;pectd by his Fellow Servants, and, in &s;hort,
might be &s;aid to be perfectly happy. But he$
that Jilt, which &s;o long flatter'd him with h$$
kind Embraces, at one fatal Blow, removes $word$
the means whereby he a&s;cended, and pu&s;hes h$$

Poverty imaginable.</P>
<P><HI>Tom</HI>'s Ma&s;ter, being Lover of Variety, his C$|rio&s;ity

Wake was kept, was about ten Miles from the N$$bleman's
Seat; &s;o each mounted his Hor&s;e, and $$way
they ride, when being arriv'd at the To$$nigh
which they were to hunt their Game, they b$$$
alight, and put up their Hor&s;es at an Inn, and h$$ing
pull'd off their Boots, out they walk tow$

many different Diver&s;ions; in one Place a Parcel
Wre&s;tlers, eagerly contending, with broken Sh$$

<P>After they had walk'd up and down the Field,

<P>Now the Dance was begun with great F$$

$$at it rais'd in <HI>Tom</HI> a mo&s;t violent Pa&s;&s;ion for
$$s Ma&s;ter's Partner: At length, Supper was
$$ought to Table, which was no &s;ooner over,
$word$t Night began to appear; the two Girls per|$$iving
the time de&s;ir'd leave to go home: The
$obleman ab&s;olutely refus'd; but <HI>Tom,</HI> thinking
$word$ make &s;ure of his Game upon the Road, con|$$ted
to go with his Partner, which the other
$$aring, beg'd not to be left alone, but that &s;he
$$ght go likewi&s;e: The Nobleman, (thinking he
$$d not brought her to the de&s;ir'd Pitch) as
$$artily de&s;ir'd her to &s;tay, vowing no body
$$ould wrong or hurt her; but when the other
$$ntleman return'd, (meaning <HI>Tom</HI>) they would

prevail'd upon her to tarry till <HI>Tom</HI>'s Return.
Now <HI>Tom,</HI> as &s;oon as he had got from the Town,
$$gan to attach his Fort, which, after a little
$$$ley, &s;urrendred at Di&s;cretion, &s;o <HI>Tom</HI> raz'd the
$$alls to the Ground, enter'd the Ca&s;tle, and took
$$&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the City, all which being tran&s;acted,
$word$ leaves her, promi&s;ing to revi&s;it her the next
$$y, and bends his ha&s;ty &s;teps towards the Inn,
<PB N="118" REF="132">
with a deal of Impatience, mutturing the&s;e Words
as he went: <HI>What a Blockhead was I to let my Ma|&s;ter
be too nimble for me? Ah! Fool that I was, $word$
loo&s;e &s;o delicious a Mor&s;el, and take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;$
$a&s;y a Fool, who as &s;oon as ask'd, con&s;ented; whe$
the other, with all the pretty engaging Airs, &s;o mo|de&s;tly
checks any thing that looks like Rudene&s;s: Wel$,
&s;aith, &s;ince it is &s;o, I'll make the be&s;t on't, and $word$
whether I can't chou&s;e him out of his Partner:</HI> So
&s;aid, &s;o re&s;olv'd, and indeed &s;o done.</P>
<P>For as &s;oon as <HI>Tom</HI> came in the Girl claim'$
their Promi&s;e, &s;aying the Gentleman, was &s;o $word$
that &s;he would &s;tay no longer, de&s;iring 'em eithe$
to go home with her, or let her go by her$$$$
But <HI>Tom,</HI> de&s;irous to renew the Sport, beg'd $word$
her, with all the prevailing Arguments he $word$
capable of, to tarry; telling her he was a littl$
tir'd with the Walk he had taken, and wante$
to refre&s;h him&s;elf, &s;o de&s;ir'd her to &s;tay, while $word$
only took a Gla&s;s, and he would go with he$$ $word$
the Girl very unwillingly comply'd, and &s;at do$$
again: The Nobleman, finding <HI>Tom</HI> had $word$
Mind to part with her, imagin'd he was bringi$$
about what him&s;elf had &s;o long endeavour'd&punc;
vain, and therefore, pulling out his Watch, &s;ta$$$
up in ha&s;te, and &s;ays he mu&s;t needs go, for $word$
was pa&s;t the time that he promis'd to be at $word$
certain Place; &s;o tells the innocent Girl he $word$
unwillingly left her, but he hop'd this would $word$
break their new Acquaintance, for he would $word$
her a Vi&s;it in a &s;hort time; de&s;iring to be $word$
cus'd for this time; and he believ'd he cou'd $$$|vail
upon the other Gentleman to conduct $word$
home: <HI>Tom,</HI> who under&s;tood his meaning, foll$$
him to the Door, and there receives his Cha$$$
which was, that he &s;hould bring her to a H$$$
they both knew, about three Miles of, as &s;oon $word$
<PB N="119" REF="133">
po&s;&s;ible; &s;o took his leave, mounted his Hor&s;e and
went thither, impatiently waiting for his Prey.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Tom</HI> was extreamly pleas'd with his Ma|&s;ter's
Intentions, re&s;olving to put the Bite upon
the Biter; and as &s;oon as the Nobleman depart|ed,
began to attack the Fortifications with all the
Artillery Wine and &s;oft Words could &s;upply him
with: But the Defendant, Proof to Battery, of
this kind, held out nobly a long time and mov'd
&s;trongly for a Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms, de&s;iring leave
to go home: But <HI>Tom,</HI> acquainted with the va|rious
Turns of Intrigues, re&s;olv'd not to loo&s;e his
Game, being well a&s;&s;ur'd he &s;hould bring her to
Articles in a little time, and begun a fre&s;h At|tack,
which la&s;ted &s;o long, that &s;he was oblig'd
to cry for Quarters; but it being too late for
going home, <HI>Tom</HI> per&s;uaded her to lie there, a&s;|&s;uring
her that he would &s;ee her well provided
for; and &s;o, in &s;hort, &s;he blu&s;hingly con&s;ent|ed.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>Tom,</HI> having gain'd his Point, orders a
Bed to be got ready, and then de&s;ired his Mis|tri&s;s,
who was, by this time, much overcome with
Wine and &s;leep, to go to Bed: The poor Girl,
(&s;till betwixt Doubt and Fear) knew not what to
&s;ay, but trembling denies what her Loocks de&s;ir'd;
and after a great many Arguments on both &s;ides
&s;he re&s;igns her&s;elf intirely to him. The &s;ly Knave,
Joyful of his Prey, conducts his Mi&s;tri&s;s to Bed;
$ut as they were going the old crafty Inkeeper
cries, in mere form, I hope, Sir, that's your Wife;
for I would by no means have any thing di&s;|hone&s;t
done in my Hou&s;e. Yes, yes, (&s;ays our
Rogue,) you may a&s;&s;ure your &s;elf it is my Wife,
or el&s;e I &s;hould not have offer'd to go to Bed
with her; while the poor Girl, hiding her Face,
$an up Stairs as fa&s;t as &s;he could.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="134">
They had not been long above, when the No|bleman,
unea&s;y at their Delay, returns to the
Inn and inquires after the couple he left. Why,
Sir, &s;aid the Ho&s;t, they're a Bed. A Bed! &s;ays
the Nobleman a Bed! Yes, an&s;wer'd he, it being
too late to go home, they took up their Lodg|ing
here. What! are they a Bed together! &s;aid
the Gentleman: Yes, yes, &s;ays the Innkeeper, I
left 'em together. The Nobleman, hearing this,
&s;tood like one Thudner-&s;truck, his Eyes darting
Lightning, and his Blood all in Flame; but bri|dling
his Pa&s;&s;ion, very cooly inquir'd where they
lodg'd, &s;aying he had &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s of moment to
impart to the Gentleman, and he mu&s;t that Mi|nute
&s;peak to him. The Innkeeper, unacquainted
with his De&s;ign, very complacently conducted him
to their Apartment, and knocking at their Door,
told <HI>Tom</HI> the Gentleman was return'd, and want|ed
to &s;peak with him. <HI>Tom,</HI> not being yet un|dre&s;s'd,
knowing his Ma&s;ter's fi'ry Temper, and
the ju&s;t Re&s;entment he was &s;ure to meet with,
opens the Window, and out he jumps, without
&s;aying a Word, and having bruis'd him&s;elf with
the Fall, lay &s;ometime upon the Ground; till re|covering
him&s;elf a little, precipitately got over
the Garden Wall, into which he had dropt from
the Window, and &s;cours over the Fields as fa&s;t
as he could, without ever looking back.</P>
<P><HI>But having ran him&s;elf out of Breath, and think|ing
him&s;elf out of Danger, down he &s;its, reflecting
upon his Melancholy Circum&s;tances.</HI> O mi&s;erable
Wretch! <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> what have I done? How dare I
ever &s;ee my Ma&s;ter, who always repos'd his Tru&s;t i$
me, and I, like a perfidious Villain, to deceive him $word$
certain Death attends me if I go home; and if
I tarry here there's nothing but Begarry or Starving&punc;
I have at once lo&s;t all credit and Reputation, and $word$
<PB N="121" REF="135">
nothing but Ruin, unavoidable Ruin. O Woman, Wo|man!
curs'd bewitching Woman! what an infinite
number of Mi&s;chiefs are ye the Souree of? But why
do I exclaim again&s;t a Woman, &s;o innocent, and &s;o
charming, when I, the traiterous Deceiver, &s;ought nothing
but her eternal Mi&s;ery? O ju&s;t Heaven, 'twas you that
&s;av'd her impending Ruin, and de&s;ervedly threw all
the fatal Effects upon my &s;elf: Well, I$ll bear '$m
patiently; load me with all the Evils ye can bring,
till they mount &s;o high, you can lay no more.
<HI>Raving and cur&s;ing in this manner, he tir'd his
Spirits, and fell a&s;leep.</HI></P>
<P>Having &s;lept &s;ometime, he awakes, wond'ring
where he was: <HI>Did I dream,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>or is it
real; no it is mo&s;t certainly true; I am the mo&s;t
wretched Mortal breathing; the very &s;ame Ruin I in|tended
the poor innocent Girl, has ju&s;tly fallen upon
my &s;elf; and what is become of her I know not, nor
dare I to enquire; but I hope as Heaven has hitherto
protected her, it will likewi&s;e pre&s;erve from the evil
Intents of my Ma&s;ter.</HI> Reflecting upon him&s;elf in
this manner, he walk'd about till Day-light, not
knowing what to do, or where to go: He was
now a great Way from <HI>London,</HI> de&s;titute of Friends
or Acquaintance, little or no Money in his Poc|ket,
and dur&s;t not &s;ee his Ma&s;ter: De&s;pairing in
this Condition he &s;ees a Company of Hay-makers,
going to work, it being Summer-time, and re|&s;olves
to make one of their Number, if po&s;&s;ible,
hoping, by that means to keep him&s;elf from &s;tar|ving,
and work his Pa&s;&s;age up to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>With this Re&s;olution he attacks the Hay-ma|kers,
asking 'em from whence they came, and
whither they were going, which they an&s;wer'd
very civily, telling him they came from <HI>London,</HI>
and were going towards the North of <HI>England;</HI>
&s;o being baulk'd in his Expectation, of coming
<PB N="122" REF="136">
to <HI>London</HI> along with 'em, he knew not what
to do; but at la&s;t re&s;olves to go along with 'em,
hoping to meet &s;omething in his Way, that might
make his Journey plea&s;ant; &s;o tells them his Re|&s;olution
to make one among&s;t 'em: But they &s;ee|ing
a Man genteely dre&s;s'd petitioning for a poor
Hay-makers Place, took him to be only in Je&s;t,
and told him they &s;hould be glad of &s;uch a Com|pa$ion
if he &s;poke as he thought; he prote&s;ted
to 'em the Sincerity of his Meaning, telling them
his Misfortunes drove him to &s;uch low Circum|&s;tances.
They then &s;aid they &s;hould be very glad
to &s;erve him; and that their Ma&s;ter would be
in the Field by and by, and he would hire him,
for he wanted Hands; &s;o he went with them, and
tarry'd till the old Farmer came, who finding a well
dre&s;s'd young Fellow wanting an Employment of
that Kind, ask'd him a great many Que&s;tions,
which <HI>Tom</HI> an&s;wer'd very pertinently; the Farmer
therefore taking it only as a Frolick, was willing
not to baulk him, and to hires him, telling he
might go to work that very Day if he would,
but <HI>Tom</HI> wanting a Fork told him, that as &s;oon
as he could get his Tools in Readine&s;s he would
come; &s;o hires a Man to go to the next Town
to buy him one, which as &s;oon as brought he
falls to work very plea&s;antly.</P>
<P><HI>Tom</HI> went with 'em from Place to Place, con|forming
him&s;elf to their Cu&s;toms in every Point,
being a very merry Companion, and much be|lov'd
by his Fellows: His pre&s;ent Life became
much plea&s;anter than his former, never inquir|ing
after his Ma&s;ter or Country Girl, nor did he
know what was become of 'em. At la&s;t it fell to
his Lot to be hir'd by the Farmer he then work'd
for, who &s;eeing him a tractable, brisk young
Fellow, ask'd him whether he would be his Ser|vant,
<PB N="123" REF="137">
for he then wanted one; <HI>Tom,</HI> after a little
He&s;itation, told him he &s;hould be glad of &s;uch
a Ma&s;ter, and &s;o &s;truck a Bargain, and let him&s;elf
for a Year.</P>
<P><HI>Tom</HI> had not been there much above half a
Year before <HI>Quarll</HI>'s Wife came down thither, who
being a genteel <HI>London</HI> Madam, reminded him of
his former Intrigues, and rais'd in him an Incli|nation
for her; but being in &s;o humble a Station,
he dar'd not to attack the haughty Dame, till he
might find a favourable Opportunity; and &s;o took
all Occa&s;ions to oblige her, and was better
re&s;pected by her than any of the others, &s;he often
&s;aying that that Fellow had a certain <HI>Je-ne-&s;$ai|quoi</HI>
in his Face, which at once claim'd Love
and re&s;pect. <HI>Tom</HI> under&s;tanding this, thought
Time would certainly bring about his Purpo&s;e,
which not long after happen'd in this manner.</P>
<P><HI>Tom,</HI> during her Alteration of Temper, had more
Liberty of Conver&s;e than before; and often di|verting
her with entertaining Stories: And one
Day, being alone with her, open'd to her the
whole Series of his pa&s;t Fortunes and Misfor|tunes,
which &s;he heard with great Attention, and
Plea&s;ure; for <HI>Tom</HI> had never di&s;cover'd him&s;elf
before to any; but thinking to gain Credit with
this Gentlewoman, made her only privy to it.
When <HI>Tom</HI> was gone &s;he began to reflect upon the
Fellow's Dexterity and believing him well skill'd
in all kind of Adventures, thought he might be
a fit In&s;trument for her E&s;cape, and re&s;olv'd to
advi&s;e with him about it; &s;o accordingly the
next Day took an Opportunity to call him to her
again when &s;he was alone, de&s;iring him to divert
her with &s;ome of his merry Tales, telling him
&s;he was then very Melancholy: Madam, &s;ays <HI>Tom,</HI>
I am &s;orry I &s;hould find you Melancholy, but
<PB N="124" REF="138">
I'll do what I can to plea&s;e you. Ay, &s;ays &s;he,
if you knew the Occa&s;ion of my Melancholy,
you'd pity me as well as be &s;orry; but you
can't be ignorant what a Pri&s;oner I am made here,
how con&s;tantly I am attended, and &s;carce any
thing but Brutes to &s;peak to; I can a&s;&s;ure you this
U&s;age is enough to make me as mad as the Peo|ple
take me to be; for I never was brought up
in this manner, which my Husband knows; it is
only a Contrivance of his to keep me here a clo&s;e
Pri&s;oner, if po&s;&s;ible; but I'll deceive him; for if a
Woman's Invention can find any means to e&s;cape
this cur&s;ed Place, he &s;hall be &s;ure to &s;ee me in
<HI>London</HI> quickly, and that to his great Mortifica|tion.</P>
<P>The &s;ly Rogue heard her very quietly, and
thought he might now have his de&s;ir'd Ends, &s;o
tells her &s;he &s;hould be releas'd that very Night it
&s;he pleas'd, and he him&s;elf would accompany her
to <HI>London,</HI> for he long'd to be there again: She
was glad to hear him &s;ay &s;o, and ask'd by what
means he intended to convey her thence. O
Lord! &s;ays he, ea&s;y enough; I'll tell you how,
I'll take a Ladder, and &s;et it again&s;t your Win|dow,
and &s;o come into your Room, and take your
Cloaths and every thing you have a mind to
&s;end to <HI>London,</HI> and carry them to a particular
Acquaintance of mine; then I'll come back and
fetch you, and conduct you to the next Town,
which is not above five or &s;ix Miles off, and &s;tay
there for the Stage-Coach, &s;o both go to <HI>London</HI>
together. The Gentlewoman willing to get her
Liberty at any rate, agreed to the Propo&s;al, only
de&s;iring another Day to look after all her things,
and pack 'em up conveniently, becau&s;e &s;he would
not hurry her&s;elf, le&s;t they &s;hould mi&s;tru&s;t, and
&s;top her Journey.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="139">
<HI>Tom</HI> con&s;ented to what &s;he &s;aid, and wi&s;h'd
for the approaching time, which being come, and
all things in Readine&s;s, he brings the Ladder,
and mounts up towards her Room; while &s;he as
readily delivers him, from the Window, all her
Baggage ready pack'd up; which <HI>Tom</HI> takes and
carries away, and pre&s;ently returns to fetch the
Gentlewoman; who, overjoy'd to think her&s;elf freed
from that tire&s;ome Place, gets out of Window,
and began to de&s;cend the Ladder, but, being over
eager, and not us'd to Entrepizes of that kind,
her Foot &s;lips, and down &s;he tumbles, Ladder and
all, which <HI>Tom</HI> &s;eeing knew the Con&s;equence and
ran away as fa&s;t as he could, leaving Mrs. <HI>Quarll</HI>
to get up by her&s;elf; for the Ladder in tumbling
broke the Windows where the old Farmer lay,
and made a horrid Noi&s;e, &s;o that it &s;car'd the
good Man out of his Sleep; who got up to &s;ee what
was the Matter, and perceiving the Gentlewoman's
Window open, and a Fellow running cro&s;s the
Yard, cries out Murder! Thieves! Thieves! which
alarm'd the whole Family; &s;ome getting Pitch|forks,
&s;ome Pokers, &s;ome one thing, &s;ome another,
in Order to &s;care the Thieves; but the old Man,
with his Fowling-piece in Hand, like a Noble
Commander lead the Van, &s;earching all his Hou&s;e
over for Thieves, and to &s;ee what he had lo&s;t,
carefully looking into every Hole and Corner, not
daring to advance too fa&s;t for fear of a Surprize;
and coming to Mrs, <HI>Quarll</HI>'s Room, who&s;e Window
he had &s;een open, calls to her a long time, but
hearing no An&s;wer, fancy'd &s;he was murther'd,
and therefore breaks open the Door, and &s;carches
the Room; but there was no Mrs. <HI>Quarll</HI> to be
found; they &s;tared at one another, not knowing
what to think. However when they had examin'd
all the Hou&s;e, they boldly &s;ally'd into the Yard
<PB N="126" REF="140">
to hunt the Thieves there, and looking about they
perciev'd &s;omething under the Ladder, which look'd
like Womens Cloaths, &s;o taking it up, they pulls
from under it a real Woman, &s;omething like Mrs.
<HI>Quarll,</HI> and looking more narrowly perceiv'd it
to be the very &s;ame individual Per&s;on, almo&s;t
dead with the Fright and the Brui&s;es &s;he had
receiv'd.</P>
<P>And now their greate&s;t Wonder was how &s;he
came there, and their Opinions very various; the
old Man &s;aid he believ'd, that &s;ome Thieves had
gotten into the Hou&s;e, and to prevent her crying
had &s;top'd her Mouth, and threw her out of
Window. But, &s;ays another Wi&s;eacre, how came
&s;he to have her Cloaths on; I am &s;ure &s;he ought
to have been a Bed? Now, adds he, I believe
the Devil tempted her to throw her&s;elf out of
Window, and that mu&s;t certainly be him you
&s;ee run cro&s;s the Yard &s;o &s;wiftly; thus they
di&s;puted, a long time, but at la&s;t agreed that &s;he
ought to be carry'd to Bed again, and have care
taken of her; and &s;o carry'd her up Stairs, and
then went to fini&s;h their Search, while the good
old Woman and her Daughter undre&s;s'd her, and
got her to Bed, and &s;at up with her all that
Night.</P>
<P>After all was fini&s;h'd, the old Man, willing to
know what Quantity of Men he had lo&s;t, calls a
general Mu&s;ter, and finding <HI>Tom</HI> mi&s;&s;ing, wonder'd
where he was got to, asking if he lay at home
that Night: They told him, no; but they believ'd
he was gone a Sweet-hearting: A Sweet-hearting,
&s;ays the old Fellow, well, let him be there al|ways,
for he &s;hall never come here again; how
do I know but he has &s;ent the Thieves to rob me,
or that he is one of 'em him&s;elf; if he ever
comes here I'll turn him about his Bu&s;ine&s;s as
<PB N="127" REF="141">
&s;oon as I &s;ee him. But <HI>Tom</HI> under&s;tood better
things than to come there again; for he knew
the Adventure would be blown, and then he &s;hould
be certainly di&s;carded with Di&s;grace; &s;o was re|&s;olv'd
to make the be&s;t of what he had got; went
away, and never was heard of again.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Quarll,</HI> as &s;oon as come to her Speech,
confe&s;&s;es the whole Intrigue, and lays the Blame
upon her Husband, &s;aying he &s;ent her there to
be murder'd, and now he had his de&s;ir'd End,
only that &s;he was the unhappy Cau&s;e of her own
Death. The old Man, as &s;oon as he knew the
Matter perfectly, writes to her Husband a full
Account of the whole Story; telling him he was
in a fair way to lo&s;e his Wife, and that, if it
&s;hould &s;o happen, he had no Occa&s;ion to &s;end for
his Wife's Cloathes; for &s;he had before lo&s;t them,
and tells him by what Means: <HI>Quarll,</HI> as &s;oon as he
had read the Letter, was very much troubled at his
Wife's Folly, but re&s;olv'd, if &s;he recover'd, &s;he
&s;hould tarry &s;ome time without Cloaths, which he
knew would be Puni&s;hment enough to her Pride;
&s;o writes back to them, That they &s;hould take all
po&s;&s;ible care to re&s;tore her to her Health, and
likewi&s;e to prevent any thing of that kind for
the future, telling them, that in a little time he
would &s;end her &s;ome Cloaths, and make them
amends for their Trouble.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Quarll,</HI> in about a Month, began to be upon
the mending Hand, which her Husband being in|form'd
of, re&s;olv'd to make her &s;tay another Month
without Cloaths, which he knew would be a
greater Puni&s;hment than the other Month of Sick|ne&s;s;
but here he was mi&s;taken; for it was al|mo&s;t
three Months before &s;he perfectly recover'd,
who finding that, before that time, her Husband
had &s;ent her &s;ome fine new Cloaths, was in great
<PB N="128" REF="142">
mea&s;ure reconcil'd to him, and re&s;olv'd, during
her &s;tay there, to be much more ea&s;y in her
Mind than before.</P>
<P>The good People, whom &s;he had often &s;car'd
with her outragious Pa&s;&s;ion, were very glad to &s;ee
her &s;o calm, and took that Opportunity to repre|&s;ent
to her the Happine&s;s of her Condition; being
well attended and as well provided with all Nece&s;|&s;aries,
free from that Subjection &s;he might be un|der,
if with her Husband, who&s;e cro&s;s and ill Hu|mours
&s;he would be oblig'd to bear with; be|&s;ides
twenty other Vexations incumbent to a marri|ed

&s;eeing no Pro&s;pect to get, being courted by none,
&s;he became a general Man-hater; but <HI>Quarll,</HI> who
was a hand&s;ome young Man, and of a genteel
Employ, tho' not a Gentleman, coming to lodge
at her Hou&s;e, reconcil'd her to the Sex in a little

<P>The old Gentlewoman (as 'tis peculiar to them

<P>One Evening that he was diverting his Collonel
and the re&s;t of his Clubb, with his &s;inging at the

<P><HI>Quarll</HI> being a brisk, hand&s;ome, genteel

made a con&s;iderable Impre&s;&s;ion upon the Ho&s;te&s;s,
who being already above forty, was very willing
to intermix her &s;upernumerary Years with tho&s;e
of a Husband of a le&s;&s;er Age; &s;o turning to Je&s;t

thus drinks to her who in a joaking way puts it

<HI>Quarll</HI> &s;aid the Collonel, lets have a Love Song
to conclude the Matter.</P>
<P><HI>Quarll,</HI> who thought the Gentleman had been
but in Je&s;t, in his Heart wi&s;h'd it could turn to
earne&s;t; the Notion of a good E&s;tabli&s;hment, and
Pro&s;pect of a con&s;iderable Advantage having blun|derd
over tho&s;e great Ob&s;tacles his pre&s;ent low
Circum&s;tance and elevated Condition made him
over look, did all he could to forward what had
been propos'd; &s;o having, according to Reque&s;t given
the Landlady a Love Song, he goes and &s;alutes
her with a hearty Ki&s;s, who, &s;miling, ask'd him
whether he thought &s;he was to be purchas'd with
a Song; to which he reply'd the Song was only
to expre&s;s the Thought of his Heart, which he
offer'd to purcha&s;e her Love: Indeed, &s;aid &s;he,
in a plea&s;ant Manner, I don't know what your
Thoughts may be, but I never heard more agre|able
Expre&s;&s;ions. Well then, Widdow, &s;aid the
Gentlemen, you cannot in Gratitude and good
Manners but an&s;wer them kindly: Indeed Gen|tleman,
&s;aid &s;he, I can &s;ay no more but that
they are mighty pretty Words and charmingly
&s;ung; well then, reply'd the Collonel, I'll &s;ay the
Re&s;t for you; the Love having expre&s;s'd his Pa&s;|&s;ion
in &s;o &s;oft Terms and engaging a Way, you
cannot, without doing Violence to your good Na|ture,
deny him what he reque&s;ts in &s;o melting
a Manner, nor &s;hall not, I &s;ay the Word; which
<PB N="136" REF="150">
was confirm'd by all the Company; to which &s;he
making no An&s;wer, it was taken for granted; &s;o
the Marriage being concluded on, the next Day
was fix'd upon for the Performance thereof: Being
re&s;olv'd not to adjourn till it was over, they be|&s;poke
a &s;plendid Supper and &s;o &s;pent the Night
merrily.</P>
<P>The Wedding was kept all the Week, during
which Time every Gentleman was profu&s;e in his
Expences, for an Encouragement to the new
married Couple, who&s;e Trade increas'd daily.</P>
<P>Their pro&s;perous Beginning &s;eem'd to promi&s;e
a happy Life, living in Love and Peace at Home,
and being in good Repute and Credit abroad; but
the &s;ame Fate as all along haunted poor <HI>Quarll,</HI> is &s;till at his Heels; his Bli&s;s was but a Bla&s;t:
His elop'd Wife unfortunately happ'ned to go by
as he was going out; &s;he had him immediately
in her Eye, which as &s;peedily convey'd him to
her Heart; the Addition, which a charming new
&s;uit of Cloaths he then had on, made to his
natural Hand&s;omene&s;s, puts out of her Mind the
Cau&s;e of that Di&s;dain &s;he had conceiv'd for him, and
turns it into a more pa&s;&s;ionate Love than ever; &s;he
cannot live any longer from him; &s;he mu&s;t ha$e
him with her at any Rate, and will not re&s;t till
&s;he finds out his Lodgings, from whence &s;he re|&s;olves
to wa&s;h all &s;orrow away with her Tears, and
&s;ettle him again in her Arms; &s;o &s;he &s;trait goes
to the Tavern &s;he &s;aw him come out of, &s;up|po&s;ing
it might be a Hou&s;e hd did con&s;tantly u&s;e,
on purpo&s;e to inquire where he lodged.</P>
<P>The new Wife, who was then in the Bar, to
whom &s;he did apply, perceiving in her &s;ome
Sort of Di&s;order, was very inqui&s;itive to know
her Bu&s;ine&s;s, which the poor Woman refu&s;ing
to &s;atisfy her withall, &s;he told her that he did
<PB N="137" REF="151">
live there, and that &s;he was his Wife, and there|fore
the fitte&s;t to know her Concern. At the&s;e
mo&s;t dreadful Words &s;he falls like one Thunder|&s;truck;
falling on the Ground, depriv'd of all
her Sen&s;es, and for a con&s;iderable Time lies as
tho' bereft of Life.</P>
<P>This dull Scene turns the new Wife's Pa&s;&s;ion
into Commi&s;eration, and pities that Misfortune,
which in her Mind &s;he before condemn'd as a
Crime; this, &s;aid &s;he, is a true Sign of Love,
which a Harlot is it not capable of; I cannot
blame her for loving him, but rather condole her
Misfortune: So having order's fair Water and
Harts-horn Drops to be brought, gave her &s;ome in a
Gla&s;s of Water, which in a &s;mall Time fetch'd
her a little to Life, who recovering, cry'd out,
had I not been &s;o bewitch'd as to go from him,
he would not have left me; the&s;e Words in a
moment turns the officious Condoler into a re|vengeful
Rival, who immediately imagin'd &s;he
had lately liv'd with him as a Mi&s;tre&s;s, and
doubtle&s;s would endeavour to do the &s;ame again;
&s;o giving her Hand (which &s;he kindly held be|fore)
a &s;cornful To&s;s from her, why you vile
Woman, &s;aid &s;he, would you have him to live
for ever in Whoredom? You judge me wrong,
Madam, reply'd the poor afflicted Woman, I am his
lawful Wife, &s;o produces her Certificate (which &s;he
happen'd to have about her) which caus'd al|mo&s;t
as much Di&s;order in the Beholder, as &s;he
her&s;elf was lately in.</P>
<P>Having recover'd her Speech, which the late
Surpri&s;e had ob&s;tructed, &s;he ask'd, her in a violent
Pa&s;&s;ion, why &s;he had been &s;o ba&s;e as to give him
the Opportunity to come and cheat her, by her
leaving him; for &s;he was his Wife al&s;o: To
which &s;he an&s;wer'd, that &s;he could not ju&s;tify
<PB N="138" REF="152">
her going from him, tho' indeed &s;he had great
Provocation, he not proving the Man &s;he took
him to be: What! reply'd &s;he in the Bar, was
he not Man enough for you? I think you, are
very hard to plea&s;e, however &s;ince the Deceit
made you leave him; why do you di&s;turb your
&s;elf about him? he has not deceiv'd me unle&s;s
it be in having a Wife before; but as you left
him of your own Accord he had no more to do
with you; no, reply'd &s;he in a Pa&s;&s;ion, but he
&s;hall find, and &s;o &s;hall you, that I have to do
with him, &s;o went away.</P>
<P>It being then about Noon, his u&s;ual Time to
come Home, from Market &s;he went into a publick
Hou&s;e, oppo&s;ite to that Tavern, there to waite his
Return, which was little after, as &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw
him, &s;he gave him a call over.</P>
<P>The &s;udden and unexpected Sight of the only
Ob&s;tacle to the Happine&s;s he then did enjoy, was
mo&s;t terribly &s;hocking to him; he wi&s;h'd he had
met with Death to have mi&s;s'd of her, but to no
purpo&s;e; &s;he had him in her Eye, and was fully re|&s;olv'd
to have him in her Arms er'e &s;he went;
and as he did not come as quick at her Call as
her Impatience requir'd, &s;he attempts to go over to
him; but <HI>Quarll,</HI> who knew her firy Temper, was
afraid &s;he &s;hould break out in a Pa&s;&s;ion in the
Street, which would have expos'd him, and brought
it to his new Wife's Knowledge, being near Home,
&s;o ha&s;tens over to the Hou&s;e &s;he was in to prevent
her coming; and judging his Beginning to up|braide
her with her Elopement would in &s;ome
Mea&s;ure moderate her railling at him, he tells
her, as he enters the Room, I hope, Madam, you
have, by this Time, found a Man more to your
Mind: This was &s;ufficient to provoke a milder Tem|per
to reproach him with his adulterous Marriage,
<PB N="139" REF="153">
of which &s;he was too certain; hers is but a Fault,
and his a Crime; but as Reproaches are not proper
means to advance a Reconciliation, which was her
Intent, &s;he bridles her Pa&s;&s;ion and Forces her Na|ture
to a Submi&s;&s;ion, &s;o throws her&s;elf at his
Feet, and falls a weeping, owning &s;he had commit|ted
a Fault for which &s;he did heartly repent, and
promis'd to attone by her future Behaviour, cal|ling
Heavens to witne&s;s her Cha&s;tity during her
mo&s;t unhappy Separation.</P>
<P><HI>Quarll</HI> being of a compa&s;&s;ionate Temper was
&s;oon made flexible by her Tears, &s;o takes her up
by the Hand, who as &s;oon fell into his Arms, un|capable

him back by the Lapet of his Coat as he was

out all the Women in the Court (who where in
great Number come to hear a Trial about a Rape
committed by a Quaker upon a Maid of fifty Years

cohabit or core&s;pond with more than one at a

imaginable, telling him his Life &s;hould always be

him he was very well &s;atisfy'd; and after a little
more Conver&s;ation left him.</P>
<P><HI>Sally,</HI> in the mean time, was not idle; for &s;he

it to the Recorder, that he might favour
<HI>Quarll</HI> in his Report to his Maje&s;ty, which had
the de&s;ired Effect; for when the dead Warrant
came down, he was excluded; and in a few Day$

with great Joy.</P>
<P><HI>Quarll,</HI> being di&s;charch'd out of <HI>Newgate,</HI> re|&s;olv'd

his belov'd <HI>Sally</HI> that he mu&s;t now leave her,
<PB N="151" REF="165">
for he had made a Vow not to tarry in <HI>Britain:</HI>
She endeavour'd to di&s;&s;uade him from his Intenti|ons;
but finding it to no Purpo&s;e, de&s;ir'd &s;he
might accompany him: He ask'd her why &s;he
de&s;ir'd to be wretched? telling her he was doom'd
to perpetual Mi&s;ery: But &s;he was re&s;olutely bent
to follow him wherever he went; and accord|ingly
&s;old what the Knight had &s;ettled upon her,
in order to carry the Money with her.</P>
<P><HI>Quarll,</HI> hearing of a Ship bound for the <HI>South
Seas,</HI> which in her Return was to touch at <HI>Barba|dos,</HI>
and the Captain of her having been fir&s;t Mate
of the Ship to which <HI>Quaril</HI> did formerly belong,
encourag'd him to venture the Voyage, &s;o accor|dingly
went to the Commander in order to agree
with his about it. The Captain, after &s;ome Talk,
began to remind their former Acquaintance, but
wonder'd to &s;ee him &s;o much alter'd as to his Con|dition,
<HI>Quarll,</HI> being very hand&s;omely dre&s;s'd, and
his Behaviour much better poli&s;h'd than formerly,
&s;o de&s;ir'd him to give him an Account how this
&s;trange Alteration had happen'd, and by what
means he came to this good Fortune. Good For|tune!
do you call it, &s;ays <HI>Quarll,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e then
you look upon Men by their outward Appearance,
but did you know the World as well I do, you
would judge the contrary: Now, adds he, I'll give
you a &s;hort Account of my pa&s;t Life, and then I'll
leave you to &s;ay, whether I am not rather th$ per|fect
Scorn and Mock of Fortune, &s;o related to him
his pa&s;t Misfortunes, which <HI>Quarll</HI> told in &s;o mov|ing
a manner, that it almo&s;t drew Tears from the
Captain's Eyes. As &s;oon had made an end, well,
&s;ays the Captain, I thought that my way of Living
brought upon me more Troubles than Land Men
are &s;ubject to, for &s;ince I &s;aw you I have been
&s;hipwreck'd twice, once upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea,</HI>
where I lo&s;t the Ship and Cargo, and but $ive Men
<PB N="152" REF="166">
&s;av'd; the other time, homeward bound from
the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> a violent Storm aro&s;e, and drove
upon the Coa&s;ts of <HI>France,</HI> where with great Diffi|culty
we made the Bay of <HI>Bi&s;cay,</HI> and there ca&s;t
Anchor in order to refit our Ship, which was very
much damag'd in the late Storm; but about twelve
o' Clock the &s;ame Night we came there, a mo&s;t
violent Hurricame blew in upon us, broke our Ca|bles,
and drove us a&s;hore, where again I lo&s;t the
Ship and Cargo, but all the Men &s;av'd: Thus I
think I have been unfortunate; but &s;ince they're
pa&s;t, never think of them; we &s;hall have a plea&s;ant
Voyage; and as you &s;ay you have a Mind to re|&s;ide
at <HI>Barbados,</HI> where I mu&s;t touch at in my Re|turn,
I'd have you lay out your Money in the
Woollen Manufacture, and Cutlery Ware, which
are very good Commodities in tho&s;e Parts. <HI>Quarll</HI>
thank'd him for his Advice, and parted with him.</P>
<P>Away then he goes to <HI>Sally,</HI> and told her what
he had been doing, and whither he intended to
go. <HI>Sally</HI> an&s;wer'd, what was his Plea&s;ure &s;hould
be hers, and that &s;he would be a Partner in his
Fortunes and Misfortunes go where he would. So
<HI>Quarll</HI> went and bought the Goods which the Cap|tain
advis'd him to, and &s;ent them on board, and
&s;oon after follow'd with him&s;elf and Wife.</P>
<P>They had not been long at Sea before his dar|ling
<HI>Sally</HI> fell &s;ick and dy'd, to his inexpre&s;&s;ible
Grief; wi&s;hing ten thou&s;and times he had dy$
with her. He began to be extream melancholy
took no Re&s;t, and would eat no Victuals. The Cap|tain
was afraid that he would die al&s;o, $word$
did all he could to divert him; but was a lo$$

Temper.</P>
<P>They &s;ail'd on with a &s;ide Wind for the Spa$$

&s;eeing them&s;elves made upon by a Pyrate, they
were obliged to weigh their Anchor, and make
the be&s;t of their way before the Wind, in order to
avoid being taken by tho&s;e Infidels, who pur&s;u'd
them from four of a <HI>Fryday</HI> in the Morning, till

aro&s;e a Storm, the Sky look'd very black, the Wind
being at North We&s;t, and Clouds began to ri&s;e and
move towards them, having hung all the Morning
in the Horizon, &s;o that they took in their Top-&s;ails,

put right before the Wind, and &s;ail'd &s;o for three
Weeks, when they made Cape <HI>Horne,</HI> they had
no &s;ooner got round the Cape, but the Wind
veer'd to the South, and it fell flat calm, which
continu'd for two Days, when the Wind &s;prung

found Wood, Water, and Herbs of &s;everal Sorts,

and there being a great Sea; &s;o that their Ship
took in a great deal of Water; the Wind con|tinuing
two Days, encreas'd to a very great
Storm, which held for one Day and two Nights
more, during which time they perceiv'd them&s;elves
near &s;ome Rocks. The Storm rather increa&s;ing, and
<PB N="154" REF="168">
growing dark, they de&s;pair'd &s;aving the Ship; and
as the Main-yard co$ld not lower, the Ship's Tack|ling

<HI>Quarll,</HI> being bold and active, took a Hatchet as
tumbled about the Deck, and ran up the Shrowds,
in order to cut down what &s;top'd the working of
the Main-yard; but, by that time he was got up,
there came a $word$ which da&s;h'd the Ship to Shat|ters

<P><HI>Quarll,</HI> in a di&s;mal Condition, remain'd the pre|ceeding

dropping wet, and &s;pread them in the Sun, and
being over-fatigu'd, lays him&s;elf down on the

<P>His Sleep, tho' very profound, was not refre&s;h|ing;

Hours before, &s;o having look'd upon his Cloaths,

the di&s;mal Apprehen&s;ions the Effects of the late
S$orm had impre&s;s'd upon him: He dream'd he
was in a terrible Tempe&s;t, and the Ship he
was in da&s;h'd backwards and forwards thro' the
Waves with prodigious Violence, the Clouds pour|ing
down va&s;t Streams of liquid Fire, and the ra|g$ng
Ocean all in Flame, in this di&s;mal Condition
he knew not what to do, but &s;pying &s;ome Land
as he thought, at a little di&s;tance from the
Ship, he was endeavouring to get there, but not
daring to venture the Sea, which he imagin'd was
l$ke a Caldron of Oil in a Blaze, re&s;olv'd to try
whether he could not jump a&s;hore; but ju&s;t as he
was going to leap, he &s;aw a horrid frightful
Mon&s;ter, with glaring Eyes and open Mouth,
ru&s;h from the boiling Flames, and make at him,
to devour him, which &s;car'd him out of his
Sleep.</P>
<P>When he awoke he, was very much terrify'd
with his Dream, and &s;tar'd about him in a frighted
manner, expecting every Minute &s;ome Creature
to devour him, but taking a little Courage, put
on his Cloaths, which by this time were quite
dry. He then looks about him; but ala&s;s! could
$ee nothing but the dreadful Effects of the late
Tempe&s;t, dead Corps, broken Planks, and batter'd
Che&s;ts floating, and &s;uch A&s;pects which at once
did fill him with Terror and Grief.</P>
<P>Turning from tho&s;e &s;hocking Objects, which
pre&s;ented to his Eyes the dreadful Death he &s;o
$ately had e&s;cap'd, he &s;ees at the other &s;ide the
Pro&s;pect of one more terrible, Hunger and Thir&s;t,
attended with all the Mi&s;eries that can make Life
burthen&s;ome. Being &s;eiz'd with the Terror of the
threatning Evil, he turns again towards the Sea,
and looking on the dead Corps, whom the Sea
now and then drove to the Rock, and back again.
<PB N="156" REF="171">
Oh! that I was like one of you, &s;aid he, pa&s;t all

pulling off his Cloaths, the Water

as it were for Repo&s;e, and he being &s;till very
much fatigu'd, prompted him to lie down and
&s;leep, during which his Mind is continually alarm'd
with the frightful A&s;pect of grim Death: Some|times
he fancies him&s;elf &s;triving with the roling
Waves, &s;tretching out his Arms to catch hold of
a Plank to&s;&s;ing by, which ju&s;t come at, is beaten
back by the roaring Billows, who&s;e terrible Noi&s;e
pronounce his Death; then other times he thinks

thus in every Object &s;eeing his approaching

<P>Being awak'd out of that irk&s;ome and unea&s;y

Thoughts: I have, &s;aid he, e&s;cap'd being drown'd
but how &s;hall I avoid &s;tarving? here's no Food for
Man; but why &s;hould I de&s;pair? did not <HI>Nebucad|nezer</HI>

to his Nation? Cannot I do the &s;ame for
a few Days, by which time, Providence, who has
hitherto protected me, may rai&s;e me &s;ome means to
get from hence: So, being intirely re&s;ign'd, he
walks about to &s;ee the I&s;land, which he found &s;ur|rounded
with Rocks, at the Bottom of which there
was a &s;mall Lake which was fordable in mo&s;t

Places, &s;o that he could with Ea&s;e wade over to
the Rock, which he did at every &s;ide of the I&s;land,
to &s;ee if he could perceive any Ship whereby he
might get away: But &s;eeing none, and drawing
towards Night, he returns and employs the Re|mainder
of the Day in looking for the mo&s;t con|venient
Place for him to pa&s;s away the approach|ing
Night; and having fix'd upon a thick Clu&s;ter
of Trees, which &s;tood pretty well &s;helter'd from
the Wind by others that did grow hard by, he
remains there; &s;o having cho&s;e the highe&s;t Tree,
he gets up as far he well could, fearing &s;ome wild
Bea&s;t might devour him if he &s;lept below, where
having return'd Thanks to Heaven for his late
great Deliverance, he commits him&s;elf to its Care,
then &s;ettles, and falls a&s;leep, and &s;lept till Hunger
wak'd him in the Morning, having dreamt over
Night of abundance of Victuals, which he would
fain have come at, but was kept off by a cro&s;s
Cook, who bid him go and fi&s;h for &s;ome; to which
he an&s;wered, that he was a Shipwreck, and had
nothing to fi&s;h withal; well then, &s;aid the Cook to
him again, go where thou wa&s;t like to lo&s;e thy Life,
and there thou &s;halt find where withal to &s;up|port

<P>Being awak'd, he makes Reflections upon his
Dream, which tho' he imagin'd might proceed from
the Emptine&s;s of his Stomack, being cu&s;tomary
for People to dream of Victuals, when they
go to Bed hungry; yet at that time it might
prove ominous; &s;o driven by Nece&s;&s;ity, and led
by Curio&s;ity, he went to the &s;ame &s;ide of the Rock
he had been ca&s;t upon, where having &s;tood &s;everal
Hours without &s;eeing Shipping, or aught that did
an&s;wer his Dream; the Air coming from the Sea
being preaty Sharp, and he faint, having taken
no manner of Food for near three Days, he gave
<PB N="160" REF="175">
over all Hopes of Relief. Thus &s;ubmitting him&s;elf
to the Will of Heaven, whom he &s;uppos'd decreed
a lingering Death to puni&s;h him for his pa&s;t Sins;
re&s;olves to return where he lay the Might before,
and there wait its near hand Coming; but being
&s;top'd by a &s;udden Noi&s;e which i&s;&s;ued from a Creek

the Curio&s;ity to go and &s;ee what did occa&s;ion it.</P>
<P>Being come to the Place he heard the Noi&s;e pro|ceed
from, he &s;ees a fine large Cod-fi&s;h, near &s;ix
Foot long, dabling in a Hole in the Rock, where
the late Storm had ca&s;t it.</P>
<P>One under Condemnation of Death, and ju&s;t ar|riv'd
at the Place of Execution, could not be more
rejoic'd at the Coming of a Reprieve, than he

he was doom'd to. Heavens be prais'd, &s;aid he,
here's my Dream right; where Providence re&s;cu'd
my Life from the grim Jaws of Death, there it
has provided me withal to &s;upport it.</P>
<P>So having taken off both his Garters, he gets
into the Hole where the Fi&s;h lay, and having
run them through its Gills, he hawls it out, and
drags it after him, being heavy, and he very weak&punc;
Going along, he finds &s;everal Oy&s;ters, Mu&s;&s;els,

this &s;mall Nutriment very much recruted his de|cay'd
Strength, and the Thoughts of his Supply of
Provi&s;ion having di&s;pers'd the dull Ideas his late
Want had bred in his Mind, he cheerfully takes
his Fi&s;h, which he drags with much more Vigour
than before, and filling his Pockets with Salt
that was congeal'd by the Sun, which he found in
<PB N="161" REF="176">
the Concavities of the Rock, away he goes to the
Place where he lay the Night before, in order to
dre&s;s &s;ome of his Cod-fi&s;h; where being come,
he picks up a Parcel of dry Leaves, and with his
Knife and a Flint &s;truck Fire and kindled them,
then getting together a few Sticks, made a Fire
pre&s;ently, and broils a Slice of his Fi&s;h; of which
he eat &s;o heartily, that it overcame his Stomach,
being grown weak with fa&s;ting: Thus &s;ick and
out of order, he applies to the helple&s;s Recour&s;e,
which was lying down, and having much fatigu'd
and harra&s;s'd him&s;elf with hauling the heavy Fi&s;h
up and down the Rock, he fell a&s;leep till the next

attack'd by a terrible Mon&s;ter, &s;uch as never was
heard of either for Bigne&s;s or Grimne&s;s, which
pur&s;u'd him, till having run him&s;elf out of Breath,

prevented being devour'd by a grave old Gentle|woman
of a mo&s;t graceful and maje&s;tick Counte|nance,
at who&s;e &s;udden Appearance the Mon&s;ter
fled: Having recover'd Breath and Strength to
&s;peak, he returns the old Lady Thanks for his De|liverance,

that he might know where to come and pay his
con&s;tant Duty to her, for this her late great Kind|ne&s;s;
to which &s;he an&s;wer'd, that &s;he was fix'd in
$word$ particular Habitation, but dwelt at every poor
Man's Hou&s;e, her Occupation being to a&s;&s;i&s;t the
helple&s;s, but not the &s;lothful and negligent; that he
&s;hould &s;ee her again before it was long; the mean
$$me &s;he bid him not to go on in evil ways, but
whenever overtaken not to de&s;pair; for &s;he was
always at Hand: Neverthele&s;s, &s;he would not have

&s;uch va&s;t Danger.</P>

Evil; but as he could make no compa|rative
Allu&s;ion of the old Lady, who re&s;cu'd him
from the Mon&s;ter; he concludes it mu&s;t be an In|&s;piration

did per&s;onate in his Dream) who lately had pre|&s;erv'd
him from a Death by all Appearance una|voidable,
to keep him from De&s;pair in this his
great Extremity, promi&s;ing to be at Hand upon
Occa&s;ion; yet would not have him neglect Means
to get away from a Place where Want threatens
him; for tho' he might for a while &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon
Fi&s;h, wherewith he may be &s;upply'd, being &s;ur|rounded
by the Sea; yet he could not imagine
which way he could be furni&s;h'd with Cloaths and
Bed again&s;t the Winter; for Want of which he
mu&s;t mi&s;erably peri&s;h with Cold; unle&s;s &s;upply'd
by &s;ome &s;uch di&s;mal Accident as expos'd him to the
Want thereof, which he heartily wi&s;hes and prays
may never happen again.</P>
<P>Having made the&s;e Considerations, he, on his
Knees, returns kind Providence his hearty Thanks
for all the Mercies that had been extended upon
him; begging the Continuation of its A&s;&s;i&s;tance;
then, as he took Direction from his Dream, he
watches the Opportunity of getting away from that
melancholy Place, &s;o goes to the other Side of
the Rock, to &s;ee if he could perceive any Ship|ping

<P>The Wind being pretty high, fed his Hopes,

kept back all Probability for that time,

&s;o depending on better Succe&s;s the next Day, he
returns whence he came, and being hungry, makes

<P>But his Thoughts, which all Day had been di|&s;turb'd

it is al&s;o the principal Subject of his Dream, which
$re&s;ented to his Imagination, that he was in a &s;pa|$ious
Place, pav'd with Hail-&s;tones of a prodigious
$igne&s;s, and &s;urrounded with high Mountains of
$word$ which echo'd with Shivers; at the further End

commonly painted, with Heaps of Snow and

to her matchle&s;s Beauty.</P>
<P>The Sight of that mo&s;t perfect and compleat Wo|$$n,
warm'd his Blood, which the Coldne&s;s of

$$rer the Charmer; as he advanc'd, every Step
<PB N="164" REF="179">
he made, &s;eem'd to add Strength to his Limbs, and
Vigour to his Life, which made him de&s;irous to
come nearer to the Per&s;on from whom he receiv'd
&s;uch beneficial Effluvias, but was &s;uddenly &s;top'd
by the old Man's turning towards him with a grim
aud &s;urly Countenance, which threatned his nearer
Approach with Evil.</P>
<P>Not daring to come nearer, he &s;tands &s;till, won|dering
what Bu&s;ine&s;s that mo&s;t charming Creature
could have with that &s;urly moro&s;e old Fellow;
&s;o lift'ning a while, he perceiv'd &s;he was asking
Boons of him in the Behalf of a va&s;t Number of
all &s;orts of Creatures that attended her at &s;ome Di|&s;tance
behind, which he refus'd in a mo&s;t churli&s;h
manner; and as &s;he &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in her Suit, fol|lowing
him up and down, the ill-nrtur'd old Man
&s;lyly &s;teps to the fro&s;ty Mourtain, and pulls down
a large Clod of Ice which did &s;top a Gap therein,
from whence came out a Creature, made and fea|tur'd
like a Man, but of a mon&s;trous Size, and
frightful A&s;pect; his exce&s;&s;ive broad Cheeks hang|ing
down on each &s;ide of his long picked Chin, like
two empty Bladders; and his prepo&s;terous Belly
hung down looking ju&s;t like a Sail without Wind;
that Mon&s;ter was no &s;ooner out, but he had Orden
from the &s;pightful old Man to drive away the Wo|man
and all her Attendance, which Word of Com|mand
was no &s;ooner given but it was put in Execu|tion;
having fill'd his &s;hrivel'd Jaws with Wind
which then &s;tood out like &s;o many Kettle Drums
he falls a blowing upon one of the Hills of Snow
and turns it into a thick Shower, which he drow
with Violence again&s;t that Angel-like Creature and
her Clients, who immediately fled for Shelter.</P>
<P>This barbarous Treatment to the mo&s;t de&s;ervi$$

I'll bury thee in that which I only &s;trow'd
over them, &s;o went to lay hold of him, which did
awake him in a wonderful Fright.</P>
<P>Being awake, he made Reflections upon his late
Dream; all my Dreams, &s;aid he, have ever prov'd
ominous, and, if I mi&s;take not, this mu&s;t have
&s;ome Signification; certainly this old Man is Time,
laying up a Store of Fro&s;t and Snow again&s;t next
Winter, and that goodly Woman is Nature, who,
being tender over all her Creatures, interceeded for
Moderation; and his &s;urly Refu&s;al and rough U&s;age
progno&s;ticates a forward and hard Winter, to who&s;e
Severity I mu&s;t lie expos'd, being altogether unpro|vided.</P>
<P>The&s;e Reflections bred various melancholy
Thoughts, which almo&s;t led him to De&s;pair: Oh!
&s;aid he, that I was but a Mou&s;e, a Bat, or a yet
meaner Creature; then &s;hould I be below the cruel
Per&s;ecutions of Fate; but Man, who was created
in the noble&s;t Form, endu'd with Rea&s;on and Un|der&s;tanding,
animated with an immortal Soul; mu&s;t
be aim'd at as the only Mark worthy its malignant
Darts; but why do I thus rave at tho&s;e Evils we
are the Authors of? had Man continu'd in his ori|ginal
State of Innocence, the very Name of Fate
or Fortune, would not have been known. Well,
&s;ince this is the Product of Sin, I accept this dull
Lot as ju&s;tly coming to my Share, and humbly &s;ub|mitting
to Heaven's Decree, I thankfully take this
Dream as a timely Warning, and, in Imitation of
tho&s;e Creatures repre&s;ented in it, I'll provide what
Shelter I can again&s;t bad Weather comes.</P>
<P>Accordingly fir&s;t he begins to think of making
him&s;elf a Hou&s;e to pre&s;erve him from the Injuries
of the Weather, but having nothing to make it of,
nor any In&s;trument but a Knife, which could be of
<PB N="166" REF="181">
little Service to him, &s;o he re&s;olves to go to that
part of Rocks where he was &s;hipwreck'd, to &s;ee
if he could di&s;cover any thing among the Wreck
that might be &s;erviceable to him, and therefore
takes a Branch of a Tree along with him, and
away he goes to the Place, where he &s;trips him&s;elf,
and goes into the Water (the Water being low di&s;|covering
the Tops of &s;everal &s;harp-pointed Rocks)
and gropes along with his Staff for &s;ure Footing,
and went up as high as his Chin, diving to the
Bottom frequently, and feeling about with his
Hands; this he continu'd doing for almo&s;t two
Hours, but to no purpo&s;e, not daring to venture
out of his Depth, for he well knew that he could
do little Good there, becau&s;e he could di&s;cover no
part of the Ship, not &s;o much as the Ma&s;t, or
any of the Rigging, &s;o fancy'd &s;he lay in &s;ome deep
Hole, where it was impo&s;&s;ible to get at her.</P>
<P>Thus de&s;pairing, and fretting and teezing him|&s;elf,
he calls to Mind that he had a Hatchet in
his Hand when he was ca&s;taway, and thought proba|bly
it might lie in that Clift of the Rock, into which
he was thrown, &s;o went thither, where looking a|bout,
he perceiv'd &s;ome thing like the Handle of
a Hatchet ju&s;t above the Surface of the Water at
the Bottom of the Rock, &s;o went down to it, and
took it up, which to his great Joy prov'd to be
the very thing he wanted.</P>
<P>Having got his Tool, he dre&s;&s;es him&s;elf, and
goes on to the I&s;land again, intending to cut
down &s;ome Trees to make him&s;elf a Hut; &s;o look|ing
about for the propere&s;t Plants for his U&s;e,
and taking Notice of a Sort of Trees, who&s;e
Branches, bending to the Ground, did take Root,
and become a Plant, he thought they might be
the fitte&s;t for his Purpo&s;e, and &s;o cuts a &s;ufficient
<PB N="167" REF="182">
Parcel of them to make his Barack, which was full
Bu&s;ine&s;s for him that Day.</P>
<P>The next Morning, having paid his u&s;ual Devo|tion,
he walks out again to look a plea&s;ant and con|venient
Place to make his Hut or Barrack upon;
he walk'd &s;everal Hours, and could find none more
&s;helter'd from the cold Winds than that where he
already lay, being in the middle of the I&s;land, well
fenc'd on the North and Ea&s;t &s;ides with Trees,
which did &s;tand very thick: The Place being fix'd
upon, he hews down &s;ome Trees that did grow in
his way, and clears a Spot of Grouud about twelve
Foot &s;quare, leaving one Tree &s;tanding at each
Corner, and with the young Plants he provided the
Day before, fill'd the Di&s;tance between, quite round,
&s;etting them about &s;ix Inches a&s;under, leaving a
larger Vacancy for the Door; his Inclo&s;ure being
made, he bends the Branches a Top from both &s;ides,
and weaves them cro&s;s one another, and &s;o makes
a Cover to it, which being &s;omething to thin, he
lay'd other Branches over, till they were grown
thicker; having fini&s;h'd the Top, he goes about
clo&s;ing the &s;ides; &s;o takes large Branches, which
he &s;trips of their &s;mall Twigs, and weaves them
between the Plants as they do for Sheep-pens, then
makes a Door after the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>His Barack being fini&s;h'd, which took him up
fifteen Days hard Work; now, &s;aid he, here's a
Hou&s;e, but where's the Furniture? this indeed,
may keep the Weather from me, but not the Cold,
the Ground on which I do and mu&s;t lie is hard,
and doubtle&s;s in the Winter will grow damp,
which, with Want of Covering, may occa&s;ion Argues
and Feavers, the Cholick and Rheumati&s;m,
and twenty racking Di&s;tempers, as may cau&s;e me
to repent my having e&s;cap'd a milder Death.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="183">
In this great Con&s;ternation and Perplexity, he
goes to &s;ee if he could &s;py any Shipping riding
within Sight of the I&s;land: As he was walking
along, full of heavy and dull Thoughts, which
weigh'd his Looks to the Ground, he hapned to find
a &s;ort of high Gra&s;s that grows but here and there,
round &s;ome particular &s;ort of Trees, which he ne|ver
took notice of before. Heavens be prais'd,
&s;aid he, I have found wherewithal to keep my
poor Body from the Ground, whil&s;t I am, by
Providence, doom'd to remain here; &s;o goes on,
intending, at his Return, to cut down a &s;ufficient
Quantity of it to make Mats that might &s;erve him
in&s;tead of Bed and Bed-cloaths.</P>
<P>Having look'd him&s;elf almo&s;t blind, without
&s;eeing the lea&s;t Pro&s;pect of what he de&s;ir'd, he
concludes upon going to cut the Gra&s;s which he
&s;tood in &s;uch Want of, and &s;pread it to dry, whil&s;t
the Weather was yet warm; that Piece of Work
kept him employ'd the Remainder of the Day,
and be&s;t part of the &s;ucceeding, having nothing
but a Pocket Knife to cut withal: That Work be|ing
done, wanting a Tool to &s;pread and turn his
Gra&s;s, he takes a Branch off the next Tree, which
having &s;trip'd of all the &s;mall ones about it, all but
part of that at the Top, being forky, made a toler|able
Fork; thus being equip'd for Hay-making, he
went on with his Work; and as he was at it, he
&s;aw, at &s;ome Di&s;tance, &s;everal Monkeys, as bu&s;y as
him&s;elf, &s;cratching &s;omething out of the Ground,
which they did eat upon the Spot, and carry'd the
Re&s;t to their Home.</P>
<P>His Hopes, that tho&s;e Roots might be for his U&s;e,
tho&s;e Creatures being naturally dainty, eating no|thing
but what Men may, made him ha&s;ten to the
Place he &s;aw them &s;cratching at, that by the Herb
<PB N="169" REF="184">
they bear (which they did tear off) he might find
out the Root.</P>
<P>Having, by the Leaves, which he pick'd off the
Ground, found &s;ome of the &s;ame, he digs 'em up,
aud carry'd them to his Barack, where being come,
he broils a Slice of his Fi&s;h, and in the A&s;hes roa&s;ts
them, which eat &s;omething like Che&s;nuts done in
the &s;ame Manner.</P>
<P>This new-found-out Eatable much rejoic'd him,
and return'd his hearty Thanks to kind Providence,
that had put him in a way to provide him&s;elf
with Bread, and that of the mo&s;t delicious kind;
&s;o as &s;oon as he had din'd, he went out on pur|po&s;e
to dig up a good Quantity; but as he was
going to the Place where he had taken Notice
they did grow pretty thick, he &s;ees a Tortois, of a|bout
a Foot over, crawling before him; Heaven be
prais'd, &s;aid he, here's what will &s;upply me both
with Victuals, and Uten&s;ils to dre&s;s it in; &s;o runs
and turns it on his Back to keep it from get|ting
away, whil&s;t he went for his Hatchet, that
he might cut the Bottom Shell from the Top, in
order to make a Kettle of the deepe&s;t, and a Di&s;h
of the flat part.</P>
<P>Being tir'd of Cod-fi&s;h, he dre&s;&s;es the Tortois,
an Animal &s;eldom eaten but upon Extremity, the
Fle&s;h thereof often giving the Flux, neverthele&s;s
&s;he ventur'd upon't, and lik'd it extremely, &s;ome
part of it eating very much like Veal, which, at
that time was a very great Novelty to him, hav|ing
eat no fre&s;h Meat for a long time before.</P>
<P>Happning to eat of that Part of the Tortois
which is the mo&s;t feeding and le&s;s hurtful, he
was in no wi&s;e di&s;compos'd; &s;o having boil'd it
all, he laid by the Remainder to cat now and then
between his Fi&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="185">
Being provided with a boiling Uten&s;il, he often
had Change, which with the lucky finding out of
tho&s;e admirable Roots, he eat the roa&s;ted ones for
Bread, and &s;ometimes boil'd 'em with Salt-Codd, in
a great Mea&s;ure mitigated his Misfortune, and &s;of|ten'd
the Hard&s;hip he lay under; and &s;eeing but
little Pro&s;pect of changing his pre&s;ent Condition by
getting away from thence yet a while, he thinks
on Means to make it as ea&s;y as po&s;&s;ible whil&s;t he re|main'd
in it; for having projected a Bed, he takes
the Gra&s;s, which by that time was dry, &s;o falls
to Work, and a Mat being the thing concluded
upon, he twi&s;ts his Hay into Roops, the Bigne&s;s of
his Leg, then he cuts a pretty Number of Sticks,
about two Foot long, which he drives in the
Ground, ten in a Row, and near four Inches a&s;un|der,
and opo&s;ite to them &s;uch an other Row at &s;ix
or &s;even Foot Di&s;tance from the fir&s;t, which made
the length of his Mat; then having fa&s;tned one
End of his Rope at one of the corner Sticks, he
brings it round the other corner Stake, and &s;o to
the next at the other End, till he had laid his
Frame; then he weaves acro&s;s &s;horter Ropes of the
&s;ame, in the Manner as they make Pallions on
Board with old Cable Ends; &s;o when he had fi|ni&s;h'd
his Mat, he beat it with a long Stick which
made it &s;well up, and the Gra&s;s being of a &s;oft
cottony Nature, he had a warm and ea&s;y Bed to
lie on.</P>
<P>The Comfort and Plea&s;ure lie found on his &s;oft
Mat (being grown &s;ore with lying on the Ground
for the Space of a Month and more) did &s;o li|berally
gratifie him for the Time and Labour he
had be&s;tow'd in making of it, that it gave him En|couragement
to go about another, a Covering being
the next Nece&s;&s;ary wanted; for tho' the Weather
was as yet pretty warm, and he in a great Mea&s;ure
<PB N="171" REF="186">
&s;ea&s;on'd by the Hard&s;hip he had gone thorough,
yet the Winter approaching, and the pre&s;ent Sea&s;on
&s;till favourable for him to make Provi&s;ion again&s;t
it, he goes and cuts more Gra&s;s, which being
made ready for u&s;e, he lengthens his Loom to al|low
for rolling up at one End in&s;tead of a Bolt&s;ter,
and makes it thicker than the fir&s;t, which he in|tends,
in cold Weather, &s;hall lie upon him in&s;tead
of Blankets.</P>
<P>Being provided with the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Furni|ture
he wanted, he thinks on more Conveniencies,
&s;o re&s;olves to make him&s;elf a Table to eat his Vic|tuals
upon, and a Chear to &s;it on when at his
Meals; thus having cut &s;everal Sticks about four
Foot long, he drives them in a Row a little Way in
$he Ground, then takes &s;maller, which he inter|veaves
between, having made the Top, he &s;ets it
$pon four other Sticks, &s;orky at the upper End,
which he &s;tuck in the Ground, at one &s;ide of his
$arack to the Height of a Table; this being done
$e cuts four more Branches &s;uch as he jug'd would
$o be&s;t for the Seat and Back of a Chair, which he
$$&s;o drove in the Ground near his Table, and having
$$wi&s;ted the Branches, that did grow to them, with
$ch other from Back to Front; and acro&s;s again
$word$ weaves &s;maller between, &s;o bottoms his Seat,
which compleats the Furniture of his Habita|$$on.</P>
<P>That Care being over, another &s;ucceeds of a far

$elter me from the Weather, and a Bed to re&s;t
$is poor Body of mine, but where is Food to &s;up|$ort
it? here have I &s;ub&s;i&s;ted near one Month up|$
a Fi&s;h, which the late dreadful Storm as took

which I hope will never be wanting, being the
natural Product of this I&s;land, &s;o I mu&s;t eat of the
&s;mall Remnant of my Fi&s;h but now and then to
make it hold out longer; Dainties or Plenty were
not allotted for him that was doom'd to Slavery,

<P>So being intirely reconcil'd to the State of Life
Providence had been pleas'd to call him to, on
whom fully depending, he re&s;olves to make Pro|vi&s;ion

he cuts a Piece of a Tree, wherewith he
makes a Shovel, in Order to dig them up with
more Ea&s;e; &s;o with it went to the Place where
he had ob&s;erv'd they did grow thicke&s;t, which being
near the Monkeys Quarters, they came down from
off their Trees in great Numbers, grinning as if
they would have flown at him, which made him
&s;top a while; he might indeed, with the In&s;trument
in his Hand, have kill'd &s;everal, and perhaps di&s;|pers'd
the re&s;t, but would not: Why, &s;aid he,
&s;hould I add Barbarity to Inju&s;tice? it is but na|tural
and rea&s;onable for every Creature to guard
and defend their own; this was given them by
Nature for Food, which I come to rob them of;
and &s;ince I am oblig'd to eat of them for my
Sub&s;i&s;tance, if I am decreed to be here another
Sea&s;on, I will &s;et &s;ome in a Place di&s;tant from

Having &s;tood &s;till a con&s;iderable Time, tho&s;e
Animals, &s;eeing he did not go forwards, each went

him the Opportunity to dig up a few for him&s;elf,
and as he was not come to the Place where they
did grow thick, he laid them in &s;mall Heaps as he
dug 'em up, which tho&s;e &s;ly Creatures would,
whil&s;t he was diging up more, come down from
the Trees, where they &s;tood hid among&s;t the Leaves,

would hold, re&s;olving to bring &s;omething next time
as would contain a larger Quantity; and fearing
tho&s;e Animals, who are naturally very cunning,
&s;hould dig 'em up and hide 'em, he comes early the
Morning following to make his Provi&s;ion; and for
want of a Sack to put 'em in, he takes his Jacket,
which he buttons up, and ties at the Sleeves; and
as he had ob&s;erved, that every Root had abundance
of little Offsets hanging at it by &s;mall Fibres, he
pull'd off his Shirt al&s;o, of which he makes ano|ther
Sack to put them in.</P>
<P>Being naked, all but his Breeches, and the Day

I will remove that Cau&s;e, which will &s;uit both
the Nature of tho&s;e Animals, and my own Circum|&s;tances;
&s;o from that time he re&s;olves to go naked,
till the Hardne&s;s of the Weather oblig'd him to put
&s;omething on.</P>
<P>So having pick'd up a &s;ufficient quantity of Off|&s;ets,
to &s;tock about two Acres of Land, he returns
Home, leaving behind him a con&s;iderable Number
of Roots dug up for tho&s;e poor Animals, that did
attend him all the Time he was at work, without
offering to touch one till he was gone.</P>
<P>Being come home, he fixes upon a Spot of Ground,
near his Habitation, aud &s;tirs it up as well as he
could with his wooden In&s;trument, in order to &s;ow
his Seed; which having compa&s;s'd in about twenty
<PB N="175" REF="190">
Days, he implores a Ble&s;&s;ing upon his Labour, and
leaves it to Time to bring forth. Thus having fini&s;h|ed
the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Work about his Barack, he re|&s;olves
to take a more particular View of the I&s;land,
which till then he had not time to do; &s;o taking a
long Staff in his Hand, he walks to the Lake, which
parts the Land from the Rock, and goes along the
&s;ide of it quite round the I&s;land, finding all the
Way new Subjects of Admiration; on the left Hand
did &s;tand a Rampart made of one &s;olid Stone,
adorn'd by Nature with various Forms and Shapes,
beyond the Power of Art to imitate; &s;ome parts
chalenging a Likene&s;s to a City, and Clu&s;ters of
Hou&s;es, with here and there a high Steeple &s;tanding
above the other Buildings; another Place claiming
a near Re&s;emblance to a di&s;tant Squardon of Men
of War in a Line of Battle; further, it bears Com|pari&s;on
with the dull Remains of &s;ome &s;umptuous
Edi&s;ice, ruin'd by the often-repeated Shocks of
Time, inciting the Beholders to Condolence for the
Lo&s;s of its former Beauty; at &s;ome Di&s;tance from
thence the Pro&s;pect of a demoli&s;h'd City is pre&s;ented
to the Sigh$; in another Place large Stones like
&s;mall Mountains, laid as it were, a top of one an|other,
impre&s;&s;es the Mind with an Idea of the
Tower of <HI>Babel:</HI> And on the right Hand a mo&s;t
plea&s;ant Land cover'd with beautiful green Gra&s;s,
like unto Camomile, and here and there a Clu&s;ter
of Trees, compo&s;ing mo&s;t agreeable Groves, among&s;t
a va&s;t Number of fine lofty Trees of diver&s;e Height
and Shapes, who &s;tood more di&s;tant, who&s;e Irregu|larity
added much to the Delightfulne&s;s of the Place.</P>
<P>As he was walking on, admiring all tho&s;e won|derful
Works of Nature, having catch'd cold (not
being us'd to go naked) he happen'd to &s;neeze oppo|&s;ite
to a Place in the Rock, which hollow'd in after
the manner of the In&s;ide of &s;ome Cathedral, and was
<PB N="176" REF="191">
an&s;wer'd by a Multitude of different Voices i&s;&s;uing
from that Place; the Agreeablene&s;s of the Surprize
induc'd him to rouze tho&s;e Echos a &s;econd time;
&s;o he gave a loud Hem, which was, like his Sneezing,
repeated in different Tones, but all very harmoni|ous;
he hem'd again, and was &s;o delighted with
the Repetition, that he could have &s;pent Hours in
the hearing of it; but why &s;hould I, &s;aid he, wa&s;te
tho&s;e melodious Sounds, &s;o fit to relate the Al|mighty's
wonderful Works, and &s;et forth his Prai&s;e?
&s;o falls a &s;inging &s;everal P&s;alms and Hymns, with as
much Emulation and Devotion as tho' he had been
in Company with Scores of skillful and celebrated
Choire&s;ters.</P>
<P>Having &s;pent a con&s;iderable Time there with
much Plea&s;ure, he proceeds in his Walk, being re|&s;olv'd
to make that his Place of Wor&s;hip for the
future, and attend it twice a Day con&s;tantly.</P>
<P>About three or four hundred Paces further, having
turn'd on the other &s;ide of a jotting-out Part of the
Rock, he was &s;topt a &s;econd Time by another &s;ur|prizing
Product of Nature; a large Stone growing
out of the Rock, advancing quite over the Lake
at the Bottom it, repre&s;enting &s;omething of a
human Shape; out of the Brea&s;t whereof i&s;&s;ued a
Fountain of exceeding clear Water, as &s;weet as Milk;
and when look'd at fronting, was like an antique
Piece of Architecture, which in old Times they
built over particular Springs; and on the other &s;ide
appear'd as if &s;pringing from the No&s;trils of a Sea-Hor&s;e:
The&s;e three &s;o very different, and yet
rightly compared Likene&s;&s;es, being offer'd by one
and the &s;ame unalter'd Object, made him curious to
examine what Parts of every Re&s;emblance help'd to
make out the others; and having &s;pent a con&s;ider|able
time in the Examination, he found every thing
which the Front had likene&s;s of was imploy'd in
<PB N="177" REF="192">
making the Side-repre&s;entation, by being in &s;ome
Places &s;hortn'd, and others lengthen'd, according to
the Point of Sight.</P>
<P>Being &s;atisfy'd about that Subject, he enters upon
another as puzling; the Ba&s;on, in which the Foun|tain
ran, which was about five Yards di&s;tant from
whence the Water did &s;pring, being but about nine
Foot over, every way, without any vi&s;ible Place to
evacuate its Over-compliment, and yet keeping of
the &s;ame Height, without da&s;hing or running over,
altho' the Stream that fell into it run as big as his
Wri&s;t; having long time &s;earch'd into the Cau&s;e,
without any Satisfaction, he conjectures it mu&s;t
make its way out &s;omewhere under Ground, &s;o
went on till he came to the Place he had begun his
March at, which ended that Day's Work.</P>
<P>Having been round the I&s;land, which, to the be&s;t
of his Judgment, was about ten or eleven Miles in
Circumference, of an oblong Form, going in and
but in &s;everal Places, extending from North to
South, the South end near as broad again as the
opo&s;ite; he re&s;olves to employ the next Day in
viewing the In&s;ide, &s;o recommending him&s;elf to
Providence, as he never fail'd to do both Morning
$nd Evening, he goes to Bed; but not being &s;leepy,
$$e over-active Faculty in Man, roves from one
Subject to another; his Mind runs from his pre&s;ent
$ation to his former, re-a&s;&s;uming his pa&s;t Plea&s;ures,
which he never mu&s;t hope to meet with again, and
alls in all the Evils his pre&s;ent Gender of Life lays
$n expos'd to. The&s;e dull Thoughts quite dis|$dge
his late-born Hopes of Heavens A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and
$akes his future Dependence on Providence; he
$arls and quarrels with his Fate, and repines at his
$ondition, which not being in his Power to mend,
$word$ wi&s;hes for Eternal Sleep, to free his Mind of
$mults and Cares which croud upon him.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="193">
Sleep was granted him, but not Re&s;t, his repining
is cha&s;tiz'd with terrifying Dreams of the Puni&s;h|ment
he had been condemn'd to; all his pa&s;t Trou|bles
comes upon him, in the mo&s;t grievious and
&s;hocking Nature they cou'd appear; his raging
Wives at once fall upon him, exerting their outmo&s;t
Malice and Revenge, which he cannot avoid; but
by embracing either an ignominous Death, or a &s;e|vere
and vile Bondage: Tho&s;e terrible A&s;pects
put him in the &s;ame Pains and Agony, as if already
feeling the a&s;&s;ign'd Torment.</P>
<P>Having in his Dream, with hard Strugglings,
e&s;cap'd Death, he finds him&s;elf in an exceeding hot
Country, his half-naked Body continually bending
to the hard and dry Ground, grabling round a nau|tious
Weed for ful&s;ome Worms; every now and
then la&s;h'd by cro&s;s and &s;evere Task-Ma&s;ter, who
hurries him to Work: In this great Perplexity he
cries out, Oh, that I had ended my woeful Days at
the &s;hameful Gibbet! Sure it would have been a
milder Fate! At which he did awake in &s;uch a
Con&s;ternation, that it was &s;everal Minutes before he
could be throughly &s;atisfy'd it was but a Dream.
Having recall'd his di&s;pers'd Sen&s;es, he made this
Reflection, that it really was the the Penalty he
had been &s;entenc'd to, and by Providence pre&s;erved
from; &s;o &s;etting his pre&s;ent Condition in opo&s;ition
to that, he acknowledges his Ingratitude, for which
he &s;orely repents, and on his Knees, with weeping
Eys, asks Pardon, imploring the Continuation of
Providence's Protection, re&s;olving, for the future,
never to think or wi&s;h to change that State of Life
it had pleas'd Heavens to place him in, wholly de|dicating
the Remains of his Days to God's Wor&s;hip,
holding henceforth as ine&s;timable, the Happine&s;s
of being freed from tho&s;e Cares which daily flow
on them who are concern'd with the World,
<PB N="179" REF="194">
which might cool or &s;lacken his Duty to &s;o great a
Benefactor.</P>
<P>So, having entirely re&s;ign'd him&s;elf to the Will of
God, he ca&s;ts off all Cares, and bani&s;hes from his
Mind all as could create any; thus re&s;olves to em|ploy
tho&s;e Hours, that run between the Intervals of
Time, he had dedicated to Divine Wor&s;hip, in the
Contemplation of the many wonderful Works of
Nature, manife&s;ted in &s;uch various manners all over
he I&s;land.</P>
<P>So he walks up the Land, which he found very
level, cover'd with a delightful green Gra&s;s, and
adorn'd with Trees of divers Sorts, Shapes, and
Height, inhabited with &s;everal &s;orts of curious &s;ing|ing
Birds, of various Colours and Notes, which en|tertain'd
him with their melodious Harmony during
his Walk: In &s;ome Places &s;tood a Clu&s;ter of Trees,
compo&s;ing agreeable and delightful Groves, pro|ceeding
from only one main Body, who&s;e lower
Branches, being come to a certain Length, apply'd to
the Earth for immediate Nouri&s;hment, as it were
to ea&s;e the old Stem that produc'd them, and &s;o be|came
a Plant, and did the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Having for &s;ome time admir'd the Agreeablene&s;s
and Curiou&s;ity of the Plant, by whom Nature &s;eem'd
to give human kind In&s;tructions; he proceeds
looking about, if perchance he could find any thing
in his way for his own proper U&s;e; &s;o took along
with him a Sample of every different Herb he thought
might be eatable: Cro&s;&s;ing the I&s;land in &s;everal
Places, he comes at a mo&s;t delightful Pond, about
two hundred Yards in Length, and one hundred
and fifty wide, with fine Trees &s;preading their
branchy Limbs over its Brinks, which was &s;ur|rounded
with a beautiful Bank, cover'd with divers
kinds of Flowers and Herbs, &s;o naturally inter|mix'd,
which compleated it in Ornament and Con-Conveniency,
<PB N="180" REF="195">
as tho' intended by Nature for more
than Mortal's U&s;e.</P>
<P>Having walk'd &s;everal times around it, with much
Plea&s;ure, he &s;at down a while upon its Bank, to ad|mire
the Clearne&s;s of the Water, thro' which, to
his great Comfort he &s;aw many different Sorts of
fine Fi&s;h, of various Bigne&s;&s;es, Shapes, and Colours;
Heavens be prais'd, &s;aid he, here is a Stock of fre&s;h
Water Fi&s;h to &s;upply me with Food, if the Sea
&s;hould fail me.</P>
<P>So being &s;ufficiently diverted with their cha&s;ing
one another, which being of many beautiful and
different Colours, made a mo&s;t delightful Scene, he
proceeds in his Walk, and goes to the South end of
the I&s;land, where he finds another Subject of Ad|miration;
a noble and &s;pacious Wood, who&s;e
Shades &s;eem'd to be made for the abode of Peace
and Plea&s;ure; he walk'd round it with much De|light,
which made the Time &s;eem &s;hort, yet he
could gue&s;s it to be no le&s;s than two Miles about.</P>
<P>Having view'd the out Side, who&s;e extraordinary
Agreeablene&s;s incited the Beholders to inquire into,
which, doubtle&s;s it inclos'd; he had an un&s;ur|mountable
De&s;ire to go into it, but was afraid to
venture, lea&s;t there might be de&s;tructive Cretures
as might harm him; yet having recommended him|&s;elf
to the Cares of Providence, he ventur'd into it,
finding &s;everal plea&s;ant Walks, &s;ome &s;traight, edg'd
with lo&s;ty Trees as tho' planted for Plea&s;ure, others
crooked and winding, border'd with a thick Hedge
of Piamento's, which did ca&s;t a mo&s;t fragrant
Smell, here and there a large Clu&s;ter of Bu&s;ines
and dwarf Trees, wherein &s;helter'd &s;everal different
kinds of wild Bea&s;ts and Fowls; &s;ure, &s;aid he, this
I&s;land never was intended by Nature to lie wa&s;te,
but rather re&s;erv'd to be the happy Abode of &s;ome,
for whom Heavens had a particular Ble&s;&s;ing in &s;tore;
<PB N="181" REF="196">
Here is every thing &s;ufficient, not only for the Sup|port,
but al&s;o for the Plea&s;ure of Life; Heavens
make me thankful, that I am the happy Inhabitant
of &s;o ble&s;&s;ed a Land.</P>
<P>Being hungry and tir'd with walking, he goes
Home, in order to get &s;ome Victuals; &s;o having
made a Fire he boils a Slice of his Salt-Fi&s;h with
&s;ome Roots, and then the Herbs he brought with
him, which prov'd of diver&s;e Ta&s;te and all excel|lent;
&s;ome eating like Artichoaks, others like A&s;|paragus
and Spinage; now, &s;aid he, what can I
wi&s;h for more? Here I po&s;&s;e&s;s a plentiful Land,
which produces both Fowls, Fle&s;h, and Fi&s;h, bears
excellent Greens and Roots, and affords the be&s;t of
Water, which by Nature was ordain'd for Man's
Drink; Pomp and Greatne&s;s are but Pagentry,
which oftentimes proves more prejudicial to the
Actor, than diverting to the Beholder; Ea&s;e and
Indulgence are apt to breed the Gout and various
Di&s;tempers, which make the Rich more wretched
than the Poor: Now, the&s;e Evils, Thanks to my
Maker, I &s;tand in no Danger of, having but what is
&s;ufficient, which never can do any Harm.</P>
<P>Thus throughly ea&s;y in his Mind, he propo&s;es to
&s;pend the Afternoon at the Out-&s;ide of the Rock,
in viewing the Sea, and looking for Oy&s;ters; &s;o
takes in his Hand his long Staff to grabble in Holes,
and his Breeches, which he ties at the Knees to
bring them in: Being come to a Place of the Rock
he never had been at before, he &s;ees, at a Di&s;tance,
&s;omething like Linen hanging upon't, which when
come at, he found to be the Main-Sail of a Ship,
with a Piece of the Yard fa&s;ten'd to it; ala&s;s, &s;aid
he, a di&s;mal Token of un&s;atiable Ambition! which
makes Men often lo&s;e their Lives, in &s;eeking what
they &s;eldom find, and if ever they do, 'tis common|ly
attended with a World of Cares: Happy is he
<PB N="182" REF="197">
who limits his De&s;ires to his Ability, a&s;piring not
above his Reach, and is contented with what Na|ture
requires: So falls a ripping the Sheet from the
Yard, which he finds in one Place ty'd with one of
his Garters (having him&s;elf made u&s;e of it for want
of another String) Heavens be prais'd, &s;aid he, this
is no Effect of another Shipwreck, but a Fragment
of the unfortunate Ship, who&s;e Lo&s;s was my Re|demption,
with that falls a Weeping.</P>
<P>Having ripp'd the Sail in Pieces, he rolls them up
in &s;uch Bundles as he could conveniently carry, and
lays them down till he had got a few Oy&s;ters, &s;o
proceeded groping in Holes with his Stick as he
went on.</P>
<P>About forty Paces further, he finds a Che&s;t in a
Clift of the Rock, which had been wa&s;h'd up there
by the Voilence of the late Storm: Heavens, &s;aid
he, more fatal Effects of Fate's Cruelty and Man's
Temerity! Was the Sea made for Men to travel
on? Is there not Land enough for his rambling
Mind to rove? Mu&s;t he hunt after Dangers and put
Death to Defiance? What is the Owner of this the
better for it now? Or, who can be the better in a
Place &s;o remote, and the Acce&s;s to it &s;o difficult,
being not to be approach'd, but on the Wings of
Providence, and over the Back of Death? Now,
was this full of ma&s;&s;y Gold, or yet richer Things,
I thank my God, I am above the U&s;e of it; yet
I'll take it Home, it was &s;ent here by Providence;
perhaps for the Relief of &s;ome &s;o nece&s;&s;iated and
de&s;titute; &s;o goes to lift it, but could not, there|fore
was oblig'd to fetch his Hatchet to beat it open,
that he might take away what was in it by de|grees;
&s;o having taken as much of the Sail-Cloath
as he could conveniently carry, with the few Oy|&s;ters
he had got, he went Home and fetch'd the
Tool, wherewith he wrench'd the Che&s;t open, from
<PB N="183" REF="198">
which he took a Suit of Cloaths and &s;ome wearing
Linen, the&s;e, &s;aid he, neither the Owner, nor I,
do want, &s;o laid them down, the next Thing he
took out, was a Roll of &s;everal Sheets of Parchment,
being blank Indentures and Lea&s;es; the&s;e, &s;aid he,
are In&s;truments of the Law, and often apply'd to
Inju&s;tice; but I'll alter their mi&s;chievious Properties,
and make them Records of Heavens Mercies, and
Providence's wonderful Liberality to me; &s;o in&s;tead
of being the Ruin of &s;ome, they may chance to be the
reclaiming of others: At the Bottom of the Che&s;t
lay a Rundlet of Brandy, a <HI>Che&s;hire</HI> Chee&s;e, a Lea|ther
Bottle full of Ink, with a Parcel of Pens, and a
Pen-Knife; as for the&s;e, &s;aid he, they are of U&s;e,
the Pens, Ink, and Parchment have acquip'd me to
keep a Journal, which will divert and and pa&s;s away
a few anctious Hours; as for the Chee&s;e and Brandy,
they will but cau&s;e me new Cares, before I had 'em,
I wanted 'em not; now, the Benefit and Comfort
I &s;hall find in them (when gone) will make me hanker
after them mo&s;t; I wi&s;h had &s;till been without 'em,
but now they are here, it would be a Sin to let
them be lo&s;t, I'll take them Home, and only u&s;e
them at my need, which will both make them hold
out the longer, and me grow le&s;s fond of them.</P>
<P>So by by Degrees takes Home the Che&s;t, and
what was in it; and now having Materials to begin
his Journal, he immediately fell to Work, that, for
want of other Books, he might, at his Lei&s;ure, per|u&s;e
his pa&s;t Tran&s;actions, and the many Mercies he
had receiv'd from Heaven; and, that after his De|cea&s;e,
whoever is directed there by Providence,
upon reading his wonderful E&s;capes in the greate&s;t
of Dangers, his miraculous Living, when remote
from human A&s;&s;i&s;tance, that in the like Extremity
they might not de&s;pair: Thus begins, from his being
eight Years old (as well as he can remember he
<PB N="184" REF="199">
heard an old Aunt of his &s;ay) to the Day of his
being Cart-away, which happen'd on the 10th of
<HI>July,</HI> 1675, being then twenty eight Years of Age,
re&s;olving to continue it to his Death.</P>
<P>Thus having written the preceeding Account of
his Shipwreck, and what had befaln him &s;ince, to
the finding of the Che&s;t, which was on the 15th of
<HI>S$ptember,</HI> 1675 he proceeds; but calling to Mind
his la&s;t Dream but one, which did warn him to
make Provi&s;ion again&s;t Winter, and the Sea&s;on be|ing
pretty far advanc'd, he gathers a good Store of
Fuel and Roots, begins to line the Out-&s;ide of his
Barack with a Wall of Turf, and lays the &s;ame at
Top, to keep out the Wet; and as he now and then
did find &s;mall Shell-fi&s;h and Oy&s;ters upon the Rock,
he makes a Bridge over the Lake, which in warm
Weather he did u&s;e to wade, that in the Winter he
might go over dry; &s;o having compleated his Bridge,
which was made of two &s;trong Poles, that did reach
from the Land to the Rock, and &s;everal le&s;&s;er
Branches laid a cro&s;s, pretty clo&s;e, he retires Home,
the Day being far &s;pent: The following Night,
being the 18th of <HI>September,</HI> there aro&s;e a violent
Storm, attended with dreadful Claps of Thunder,
which the many Echos from the Rock render'd
more terrible, and Lightnings fla&s;hing in a mo&s;t
frightful Manner, &s;ucceeding each other, before the
preceeding was well out of the Sky, which put
poor lone&s;ome <HI>Quarll</HI> in &s;uch a Con&s;ternation, that
(notwith&s;tanding his Reliance on Heaven's Pro|tection)
he would have given the World (had it
been in his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion) to have been within the
Reach of human A&s;&s;i&s;tance; or, at lea&s;t to have
&s;ome Company, Solitude adding much to his Terror
and Affliction.</P>
<P>The glorious Ri&s;ing of the next Mornings Sun,
having laid the mortifing Rage of the blu&s;tring
<PB N="185" REF="200">
Winds, <HI>Quarll,</HI> who&s;e late Alarm was hardly quell'd
&s;till &s;u&s;pected its mo&s;t reviving Rays, to be
terrifying Glances and Fla&s;hings of Lightnings;
but having lain a while, and hearing no Noi&s;e,
but that, which &s;till did rage in his Mind, was at
la&s;t convinc'd the Storm was over, and &s;o gets up,
with a Re&s;olution to go and &s;ee if he could de&s;cern
any Effects of the late Tempe&s;t.</P>
<P>Being come at the other Side of the Rock, he &s;aw
indeed, &s;urprizing Objects, but not afflicting; the
Mi&s;chief that was done, being to the Inhabitants of
the Sea only, a va&s;t Number of which, had, by the
ob&s;tropulous Wind been dis-elemented; a Quantity
of &s;tately Whitings, fine Mackerels, large Herrings,
diver&s;e &s;izes of Codlings, and &s;everal other &s;orts of
Fi&s;h, with a great Number of Shells, of different
Shapes and Bigne&s;&s;es, lying up and down upon the
Rock. Heavens be prais'd! &s;aid he, in&s;tead of Dam|age
to bewail, what Thanks have I now to return for
this mighty Benefit? Here the powerful Agent of
Mi&s;chief is, by kind Providence, made a Mini&s;ter of
Good to me; make me thankful, I am now pro|vided
for all the next Winter, and yet longer, by
which time I'm certain to have fre&s;h Supply.</P>

very much wanted, his Spirits being, very low; but
was loath to ta&s;te it, lea&s;t he &s;hould grow fond of

which he did drink, being at his Mouth, the Cor|dial
turns to a Nector; one Gulp decoys another
down; &s;o the intended Dram becomes a hearty
Draught. The Plea&s;antne&s;s of the Liquor made
him forget its Nature, &s;o that poor <HI>Quarll,</HI> who
had, for the Space of near three Months before,
drank nothing but Water, was pre&s;ently overcome

his Appetite, with that wherewith he only
ought to have refre&s;h'd Nature; and &s;ince that of|ten

the Fault, he did dedicate that Day, in which
he became &s;en&s;ible of it; in Prayers and Fa&s;ting,
and every Seventh from that, he &s;ets apart for Di|vine
Wor&s;hip only, which he hop'd would keep
him from breaking the Commandments, for keeping
Holy the Sabbath Day; it being not certain that
the Day appointed by the Church for that Purpo&s;e,
was the very Day God had &s;anctify'd for Re&s;t, &s;o
went to the Place, where the Ecchos, in many diffe|rent

whil&s;t fre&s;h; he improves the fair Weather to dry
one Part of the Remainder, and keeps the Re&s;t in

<P>The Winter being near at Hand, and the Wea|ther
growing damp and cold, hinders him from his
Walks, &s;o being confin'd within Doors, he imploys
his idle Hours in beautifying his Uten&s;ils, which

Pains in &s;craping and poli&s;hing the Re&s;t of his

of Pearl, which made them not only more fit for
their intended U&s;es, but al&s;o a great Ornament to
his Barack, which he &s;helv'd round with platted
Twigs after the Manner of his Table, and &s;o &s;et
them upon't.</P>
<P>Thus he &s;pent the be&s;t Part of the Winter,
making no further Remarks, but that it was very
&s;harp, attended with high Winds, abundance of
Hail and Snow, which oblig'd him to make a
Broom to &s;weep it away from about his Hut,
which otherwi&s;e would have been damag'd by it.</P>
<P>But &s;hivering Winter, having exau&s;ted his fro&s;ty
Stores, and weary with vexing Nature, retir'd; Bo|reas
al&s;o, grown faint with hard blowing, is forc'd

forth to u&s;her in the blooming Spring; &s;o mildly
&s;lips on to inform Nature of her Favourite's Ap|proach,
who at the joyful News puts on her
gay enamel'd Garb, and, out of her rich Wardrobe
&s;upplies all Vegetables with new Ve&s;ture, to wel|come
the mo&s;t lovely Gue&s;t. The feather'd Choi|ri&s;ters

their harmonious Notes.</P>
<P><HI>Quarll</HI> al&s;o, whom bad Weather had confin'd
within Doors a con&s;iderable Time, which had in
a great Mea&s;ure numb'd his Limbs, and dull'd his
Sen&s;es, now finds him&s;elf quite reviv'd, he no
longer can keep within, the fair Weather invites
him out, the &s;inging Birds on every Side call to
him, Nature it &s;elf fetches him out to behold her
Trea&s;ures.</P>
<P>Having with un&s;peakable Plea&s;ure walk'd &s;ome
time, diverted with the &s;weet Melody of various
kinds of &s;inging Birds, and the Sight of abundance
of different &s;orts of blo&s;&s;om'd Trees and blooming
Flowers; all Things within the l&s;land, in&s;piring
joy; he had the Curio&s;ity to go and view the Sea,
&s;o goes over his Bridge, and then at the over Side
of the Rock, where he finds more Objects, requiring
$s much Admiration, but affording a great deal le&s;s
Plea&s;ure: Va&s;l Mountains of Ice floating up and
flown in Numbers, threatning Emer&s;ion to all as
came in their Way.</P>
<P>The&s;e terrible Effects of the Winter, which to
that Time was a Stranger to, occa&s;ion'd his making

<L>If Fortune on him &s;miles, giving his Toil Succe&s;s,</L>
<L>Each Day new Cares ari&s;e, which mar his Happine&s;s;</L>
<L>The only Trea&s;ure then, worth laying up in Store,</L>
<L>Is a contented Mind, which never leaves one Poor,</L>
<L>He is not truly Rich, who hankers after more.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="205">
So having return'd Heaven Thanks for his happy
State, being above wi&s;hing to enjoy Content; he
creeps to the North-ea&s;t Side of the Rock, at the
Foot of which lay, an extraordinary large Whale,
which the late high Wind had ca&s;t there, and dy'd
for want of Water. If this, &s;aid he, is all the Da|mage
that has been done la&s;t Winter, it may be
born, &s;o went down and mea&s;ur'd the Length of
it, whith was above 30 Yards, and proportionably
in Bigne&s;s; there were Shoals of &s;mall Fi&s;hes
&s;wimming about it in the &s;hallow Water wherein
it lay, as rejoicing at its Death; thus &s;aid he, the
oppre&s;s'd rejoice at a Tyrant's Fall; what Number
of the&s;e have been de&s;troy'd to make this mon|&s;trous
bulk of Fat; well, happy are they, who, like
me, are under Heaven's Government only; &s;o with
his Knife, which he always carried in his Pocket,
cuts &s;everal Slices of the Whale, and throws them
to the &s;mall Fi&s;hes, &s;aying, 'tis but ju&s;t ye &s;hould
at la&s;t feed on that which &s;o long fed on you; and
as Oil run in abundance from the Places he had
cut the Slices out of, it vex'd him to &s;ee that wa&s;ted,
as might turn to good Money, but why &s;aid he,
&s;hou'd I be di&s;turb'd at it, what U&s;e have I for
any? Providence takes none, it gives me all <HI>gratis;</HI>
&s;o goes on feeling for Oy&s;ters with his Staff, which
he always walk'd with, being a great Help to him,
in climbing up the Rock.</P>
<P>Having at la&s;t found a Hole, where by their rat|tling
at the Bottom with his Staff, he judg'd there
might be a pretty many, he marks the Place, and
goes Home to contrive &s;ome In&s;trument to drag
them up, being yet too cold for him to go in the
Water; and as he had no Tool but his Knife and
Hatchet, both improper to make a Hole in a Board,
as requi&s;ite to make a Rake which was wanting for
that Purpo&s;e; he beats out the End of his Che&s;t,
<PB N="191" REF="206">
in which there was a Knot; &s;o having driven it out,
he fat&s;tens the &s;mall End of a Pole in it: Thus
equip'd, he went and rak'd up Oy&s;ters, which ad|ded
one Di&s;h to his Ordinary, and Sauce to others;
yet at length his Stomach growing qualmi&s;h with
eating altogether Fi&s;h, and drinking nothing but
Water withal, he wi&s;hes he could have a little
Fle&s;h, which he might ea&s;ily, there being Animals
enough in the Wood apparently fit for Food, but
then he mu&s;t deprive them of their Lives, barely
to make his own more ea&s;y.</P>
<P>Thus debates with him&s;elf for &s;ome time, whe|ther
or no, it would not be Inju&s;tice for him (who
only by a providential Accident was brought there
to &s;ave his Life) now to de&s;troy tho&s;e Creatures,
whom (to pre&s;erve) Nature has given Being, in
a Land out of Man's reach to di&s;turb; yet Nature
requires what &s;eems to be again&s;t Nature for me to
grant: I am faint, and like to grow wor&s;e, the
longer I ab&s;tain from Fle&s;h.</P>
<P>Having paus'd a while, why &s;aid he, &s;hould I
be &s;o &s;crupulous! were not all Things created for the
U&s;e of Man? Now, whether it is not wor&s;e to let
a Man peri&s;h, than to de&s;troy any other Creature
for his Relief? Nature craves it, and Providence
gives it; now, not to u&s;e it in Nece&s;&s;ity, is under|valuing
the Gift, and de&s;pi&s;ing the Donor.</P>
<P>So having concluded upon catching &s;ome of tho&s;e
Animals he had &s;een in the Wood, he con&s;iders by
which means, having no Dogs to hunt, not Guns
to &s;hoot; having paus'd a while, he re&s;olves upon
making Gins, wherewith he had &s;een Hares catch'd
in <HI>Europe;</HI> thus taking &s;ome of the Cords which
&s;he found with the Sail at the out-&s;ide of the Rock;
$he goes to work, and makes &s;everal, which he fa|&s;tens
at divers Gaps in the Thick-&s;et within the
<PB N="192" REF="207">
Wood, thorough which he judg'd that &s;ort of
Bea&s;t (he had a Mind for) went.</P>
<P>Impatient to know the Succe&s;s of his Snares, he
gets up by time the next Morning, and goes to ex|amine
them, in one of which he found a certain
Animal &s;omething like a Fawn, the Colour of a
Deer, but Feet and Ears like a Fox, and as big as
a well grown Hare; he was much rejoyc'd at his
Game, who&s;e Mouth he immediately open'd to
&s;ee if he could find out whether he fed upon
Gra&s;s, or liv'd upon Pray. The Creature being
catch'd by the Neck, and &s;trangled with &s;trugling
before it dy'd, had brought up in his Throat
&s;ome of the Greens it had been eating, which very
much pleas'd him, accounting tho&s;e who liv'd upon
Fle&s;h as bad as Carrion.</P>
<P>Having return'd Thanks for his good Luck, he
takes it Home in order to dre&s;s part of it for his
Dinner, &s;o ca&s;es and guts it; but its proving to be
a Female, big with three young ones, griev'd him
to the Heart, and made him repent making tho&s;e
killing Noozes; what pity &s;aid he, &s;o many Lives
&s;hould be lo&s;t, and Creatures wa&s;ted, one would
have &s;erv'd me four Days, and here are four kill'd
at once, three were of being, not come to Perfection,
mu&s;t be thrown away; well, henceforth to prevent
the like Evil, I'll take alive what I ju&s;t want, and &s;ave
all the Females; &s;o having &s;tuck a long Stick at
both Ends in the Ground, making a half Circle,
he hangs one Quarter of the Animal on a String
before a good Fire, and &s;o roa&s;ts it.</P>
<P>His Dinner being ready, having &s;aid Grace, he
&s;et to eating with an uncommon Appetite, and
whether it was the Novelty of the Di&s;h, or that
the Meat did really de&s;erve the Prai&s;e, he really
thought he never eat any Thing of Fle&s;h before
comparable to't, either for Ta&s;te or Tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="208">
Having din'd both plentifully and deliciou&s;ly,
he mo&s;t zealou&s;ly returns kind Providence Thanks
for the late, and all Favours receiv'd, then pur&s;uant
to his Re&s;olution; he goes about making Nets, in
order to take his Game alive for the future, and as
he had no &s;mall Twine to make it withal, he was
oblig'd to unravel &s;ome of the Sail which he luckily
had by him, and with the Thread, twi&s;t &s;ome of
the Bigne&s;s he judg'd proper for that U&s;e.</P>
<P>Having made a &s;ufficient Quantity, he makes a
couple of Nets about four Foot &s;quare, which he
fa&s;tens in the Room of the killing Snares; &s;o re|tir'd,
having implor'd Heaven's Ble&s;&s;ing on his
Labour, and re&s;olv'd to come and examine them
every Morning.</P>
<P>Several Days pa&s;s'd without taking any Thing,
&s;o that he wanted Fle&s;h a whole Week, which did
begin to di&s;order his Stomach, but not his Temper;
being intirely re&s;igned to the Will of Providence,
and fully contented with whatever Heaven was
pleas'd to &s;end.</P>
<P>One Afternoon, which was not his cu&s;tomary
Time of Day to examine his Nets, being they are
too vi&s;ible in the Day for Game to run in; he hap|pen'd
to walk in the Wood to take a full Dimention
thereof, &s;o chanced to go by his Nets, in one of
which was taken two Animals, as big as a Kid &s;ix
Weeks old, of a bright Dun, their Horns upright
$nd &s;traight, their Shape like a Stag, mo&s;t curiou&s;ly
$imb'd, a &s;mall Tuff of Hair on each Shoulder and
Hip; by their Horns which were but &s;hort, they
$ppear'd to be very young, which rejoyc'd him the
more, being in hopes to tame, tho&s;e which he did
$ot want for pre&s;ent U&s;e; &s;o carry'd them Home,
$$$yful of his Game, depending upon a good Din|ner,
but was &s;adly di&s;appointed, the Animals he
found they were Antilopes (calling to Mind he had
<PB N="194" REF="209">
&s;een of them in his Travels) and proving both Fe|males,
which he had made a Re&s;olution to pre&s;erve,
tho' they were too young to be with Kid, and he in
great need of Fle&s;h, yet he would not kill them, &s;o
with Cords fa&s;tens them to the out&s;ide of his Lodge,
and with con&s;tant feeding of them in two Months
time, made them &s;o tame, that they follow'd him
up and down, which added much to the Plea&s;ure
he already took in his Habitation, which by that
time was cover'd with green Leaves, both Top and
Sides; the Stakes it was made off, having &s;truck
Root, and &s;hot out young Branches, who&s;e Strength
promi&s;ing that Summer to fill up the Vacancy be|tween
each Plant, made him pull down the Tur&s;s
wherewith he had cover'd the out&s;ide and top of
his Hut, to keep the Cold out in the Winter.</P>
<P>His former Hut being now become a plea&s;ant Ar|bour,
gave him Encouragement to be&s;tow &s;ome
Pains about it, towards the Imbeli&s;hment of it,
which &s;eemingly depends on being well attended;
he re&s;olves upon keeping of it prun'd and water'd,
the better to make it grow thick and fa&s;t, which
an&s;wer'd his Intent, for in three Years time, the
Stems of every Plant as compos'd the Arbour,
were grown quite clo&s;e, and made a &s;olid Wall of
about &s;ix Inches thick, cover'd with green Leafs
without, which lay mo&s;t regular and even, and
within, with a mo&s;t agreeable &s;mooth Bark of a
plea&s;ant Olive-colour.</P>
<P>His late Arbour being, by his Care and Time
and Nature's A&s;&s;i&s;tance, become a matchle&s;s Lodge,
as intended by Nature for &s;omething more than hu|mane
Gue&s;t, he now con&s;ults to make it as com|modious
as beautiful; here is, &s;aid he, a delightful
Dwelling, warm in the Winter, and cool in the
Summer, delightful to the Eye, and comfortabl$
to the Body; pity it &s;hou'd be imploy'd to any
<PB N="195" REF="210">
U&s;e, but Repo&s;e and Delight: So re&s;olves upon
making a Kitchen near it, as being the principal
and mo&s;t prejudicial Office to a Hou&s;e; thus having
fixd upon a Place convenient at the next Side of his
Lodge, about &s;ix Foot from it, twelve in Length,
and eight in Breadth, which he inclo&s;es with the
Turfs as covered the out&s;ide of his Arbour, before
it was &s;ufficiently thick to keep out the Cold; then
having lay'd Sticks a-cro&s;s the Top of the Walls,
which were about eight Foot high, he lays Turfs
thereon, and &s;o covers it, leaving an open Place for
the Smoak to go out off.</P>
<P>The out&s;ide being done, he goes about in&s;ide Ne|ce&s;&s;aries,
as Fire-places to roa&s;t and boil at; thus
cuts a Hole in the Ground at a &s;mall Di&s;tance from
the Wall, after the Manner of &s;tew Stoves in No|blemen's
and great Eating-hou&s;e Kitchens; then
at another convenient Place, he &s;ets two flat Stones,
about eight or nine Inches broad, and one Foot
long edge-ways, oppo&s;ite one another, near two
Foot a&s;under, then puts a third in the &s;ame Man|ner
at the End of the other two, &s;o makes a Fire|place
fit to roa&s;t at: Then for other Conveniencies,
$he weaves Twigs about Sticks, &s;tuck in the Wall
one &s;ide of his Kitchen, where he lays the Shells
$word$ us'd for Uten&s;ils, which both adorn'd and fur|ni&s;h'd it.</P>
<P>Having compleated that Piece of Work, he goes
and vi&s;its his Plantations, which he finds in a
$hriving Condition, the Roots being, in &s;ix Months
time, grown from the bigne&s;s of a Pea (as they
were when fir&s;t &s;et) to that of an Egg; his Anti|$opes
al&s;o were come to their full Growth, and
compleat Beauty, which exceeded mo&s;t four
$ooted Bea&s;ts; having a mage&s;tick Pre&s;ence the
Body and Limbs were like a Stag, and the
noble March of a Hor&s;e: So every Thing did con|cur
<PB N="196" REF="211">
to his Happine&s;s; for which, having return'd
his mo&s;t liberal Benefactor his mo&s;t grateful Ac|knowledgments,
he thinks on Means to prevent
any Ob&s;tructious, as may intercept the Continua|tion
thereof; and as the Want of Cloaths was the
only Cau&s;e he could think of, as might make him
unea&s;y; having but the Jacket and Ho&s;e which
were given him on Board, to &s;ave his own Cloths,
which when, worn out, he could not recruit;
therefore, to accu&s;tom him&s;elf to go without, he
thins tho&s;e he had, &s;o takes away the Lining from
the out&s;ide of his Clothing, in order to wear the
thicke&s;t in the colde&s;t Weather; and &s;o thin
his Dre&s;s by degrees, till at la&s;t, he went quite
naked.</P>
<P>Having thus concluded, as being the be&s;t Shift
Nece&s;&s;ity could rai&s;e him, he falls a ripping his
Jacket, in the Lining whereof he finds &s;even
Peas and three Beans, which were got in at a
Hole, at the Corner of the Pocket.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e few made him wi&s;h for more, which
he had no room to hope for, being they are

Goat to eat at Intervals between Fi&s;h, he com|monly
found on the Rock after high Winds and

did prove, thus diverted many anxious Hour
<PB N="197" REF="212">
with Variety of Objects that Element affords:
Sometimes, he had the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing great
Whales cha&s;ing one another, &s;pouting large Streams
of Water out of their Gills and No&s;trils; and O|ther
times numbers of beautiful Dolphins rolling
among&s;t the Waves; now and then a Quantity or
&s;trange mon&s;trous Fi&s;h, playing on the Surface of
the Sea, &s;ome whereof had Heads like Hogs, others
like Dogs, Calves, Hor&s;es, Lions, Bulls, Goats,
and &s;everal other Likene&s;&s;es, not common to Fi&s;hes,
&s;ome cha&s;ing another Sort, who, to avoid being
taken, would quit its Element, and &s;eeek Refuge in
the Air, and fly &s;ome Yards above Water, till
their Fins being dry, obliged them to plunge in a|gain.</P>
<P>The&s;e Pa&s;times, being generally &s;ucceeded with
bad Weather and dreadful Storms, check'd the Plea|&s;ure

Pond in his Way, which he had been at twice, or
thrice a Week, ever &s;ince his being in the I&s;land,
and calling to Mind, that in all that time he never
&s;aw a young Fi&s;h in it, he conjectur'd &s;omething
mu&s;t de&s;troy the &s;mall Ones, and as he imagin'd it
prov'd to be; for, at his Approach, then flew out
of the Pond, a large Fowl, with a Fi&s;h in his Bill,
being too large for it to &s;wallow.</P>
<P>The Di&s;tance he was at, as al&s;o the Bird being
upon the Wing, he could not di&s;cern, neither Co|lour
nor Make; but he had the Satisfaction of di&s;|covering
the Cau&s;e why the Fi&s;h did not encrea&s;e,
being devour'd when young by that Creature,
which, to prevent for the future, he &s;tudies on
means to kill the De&s;troyer; Nets not being pro|per
<PB N="198" REF="213">
In&s;truments, it being requi&s;ite for that Purpo&s;e
to have one all round, as al&s;o to cover the Pond,
which was impo&s;&s;ible, by Rea&s;on of its Largne&s;s,
and a Le&s;s being of no u&s;e, the Bird probably not
coming to a certain Place; he wi&s;h'd for a Gun,
and Amunition fitting, as being the mo&s;t probable
Thing to &s;ucceed; but no &s;uch In&s;trument being
in his reach, he ponders again, during which time,
a Cro&s;s-Bow offers it&s;elf to his Mind, but is as di&s;tant
from his reach as the Gun; 'tis true, there was
Stuff enough in the I&s;land to make many, but no
Tools, but a Hatchet and a Pocket-Knife, where|with
if he made &s;hift to cut and &s;hape a Bow, he
could not make a Latch and Spring nece&s;&s;ary to it,
&s;o he mu&s;t not think on't; yet, a Bow being the
only Thing he could apply to, he goes about one
forthwith, thus having pick'd a Branch of a Tree,
which had the Re&s;emblance of Yew and as tough,
of which they are &s;ometimes made; he with the
Tools he had made &s;hift to make one, of about &s;ix
Foot long, and Arrows of the &s;ame, which he
hardens and &s;traightens over the Fire, then having
&s;lit them at one End about two or three Inches, he
&s;lips in a Bit of Parchment, cut &s;harp at one End,
and about three Inches at the other, then ties the
End clo&s;e to keep it in, which &s;erv'd for Feathers,
and with the Ravelings of &s;ome of the Sail he makes
a String to it.</P>
<P>Thus equipt for an Archer, wanting nothing but
Skill, which is only to be gain'd by Practice, he
daily exerci&s;e Shooting at a Mark for the Space
of a Fortnight; in which time he made &s;uch an
Improvment, that in three Shoots he would hit a
Mark of about three Inches &s;quare, at near fifty
Paces di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Being &s;ufficiently skill'd, he goes and lays in
wait for iris de&s;ir'd Game; &s;o placed him &s;elf behind
<PB N="199" REF="214">
a Tree, as near to the Pond as he could, where the
Bird came in few Hours after.</P>
<P>The Creature being pitch'd upon the Bank, never
&s;tood &s;till, but kept running round, watching for a
&s;izeable Fi&s;h fit to &s;wallow, &s;o that he had no Op|pertunity
to &s;hoot; till having at la&s;t &s;py'd out one,
it launch'd it&s;elf into the Poud, but rais'd more ea&s;ily,
which gave him time to take Aim, neverthele&s;s he
mi&s;s'd it, being in Motion; but when come to the
Top he took it thro' the Body, as it open'd its
Wings, and laid flat on the other Side of the
Pond: He took it up, wonderfully pleas'd at his
good Succe&s;s the fir&s;t Time of his practicing his
newly-acquir'd Art; yet, having taken Notice
of the Birds Beauty, he had a Regret for its Death,
tho' he might in time have rue'd its living; the
Stock of Fi&s;h Weekly decrea&s;ing by his own catch|ing
one now and then with a Small-Net, he made
for that U&s;e, when &s;hort of other Provi&s;ions, and
their recruiting prevented by that Bird's daily de|vouring
their Young. 'Tis true, &s;aid he, I have by
killing this admirable Creature, pre&s;erv'd what is
much better for my U&s;e; but then, I have de&s;troy'd
that as was certainly made for Nature's Diver&s;ion,
&s;uch Variety of Colours, &s;o regularly plac'd, and
wonderfully order'd, that at the lea&s;t Motion of ei|ther
the Object or Beholder, they &s;eem'd to inter|change
each-others Seat.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the inexpre&s;&s;ible Beauty of the Feathers,
which were after the Nature of a Drake, every one
di&s;tingu&s;h'd from one another, by a Rim round the
Edge thereof, about the Breadth of a large Thread,
and of a changeable Colour, from Red to Aurora
and Green; the Ribs of a delightful Blue, and the
Feathers-Pearl colour, &s;peckl'd with a bright Yellow,
the Brea&s;t and Belly (if it might be &s;aid to be of any
particular Colour) was that of a Dove's Feathers,
<PB N="200" REF="215">
rim'd like the Back, diver&s;ly changing; the Head,
which wae like that of a Swan for make, was Pur|ple
al&s;o, changing according as mov'd; the Bill like
burni&s;h'd Gold; Eyes like a Ruby, with a Rim of
Gold round it; the Feet the &s;ame as the Bill; the
Bigne&s;s of the Bird, was between a middling Goo&s;e
and a Duck, and the Make of a Swan.</P>
<P>Having bemoan'd the Death of that delightful
Creature, he carefully takes out its Fle&s;h, which
corrupting would &s;poil the Out&s;ide, then fills the
Skin with &s;weet Herbs, which he dry'd for that
U&s;e, then having &s;ow'd up the Place he had cut
open to take the Fle&s;h out, he &s;et it up in his
Lodge.</P>
<P>His good Succe&s;s in Archering, made him love
the Exerci&s;e; &s;o, that what odd Hours he had in
the Day, be&s;ides tho&s;e he &s;et a Part for his Divine
Wor&s;hip, and tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ary Occupations about his
Lodge, Plantations, and making Remarks, he be|&s;tow'd
in &s;hooting at the Mark, which in Time,
made him &s;o expert, that he hardly would mi&s;s a
&s;tanding Mark the Bigne&s;s of a Dove, at forty or
fifty Yards di&s;tance, once in ten Times, and toller|ably
would &s;hoot as well Flying: Having once the
Opportunity and Occa&s;ion to try it upon a mon|&s;trous
Eagle, who often flew rounding, over the
Place where his <HI>Antelopes</HI> and <HI>Goats</HI> fed, near his
Lodge, whom he Shot at, fearing it would damage
them and kill'd with the &s;econd Arrow.</P>
<P>The Summer being over, during which, having
been much took up about his Habitation and Plan|tations,
he had neither Time nor Opportunity to
make Remarks, no further than that it was &s;ome
Days very Show'ry, and for the generality very
hot; but now the Weather being grown &s;omething
cold, and the Wind pretty Sharp, he mu&s;t be o|blig'd
to put on &s;ame Cloaths to keep it off, being,
<PB N="201" REF="216">
as yet, too tender to go any longer without, next
to provide for his <HI>Antelopes,</HI> again&s;t the Near-at-hand
Winter; &s;o makes a Lodge for them at the
Back&s;ide of his Kitchin, with Sticks, which he
drove into the Ground about two Foot from the
Wall, and then bends them about three Foot from
the Ground, and &s;ticks them about the &s;aid Wall, and
&s;maller Branches he inter-wove between them, he
&s;huts up the Front, and covers the Top, leaving
both Ends open for the Animals to go in at, then
lays Gra&s;s (which he got dry'd on Purpo&s;e) in the
&s;aid Lodge for them to lie on; thus having dug up
a con&s;iderable Quantity of Roots, and being already
&s;tock'd with Salt-fi&s;h both dry and in Pickle, he
was pretty well provided for his Cattle, and him&s;elf
again&s;t the en&s;uing Winter, which prov'd much like
the preceeding one, only not &s;o &s;tormy.</P>
<P>The &s;ucceeding Spring having awak'd &s;lumbring
Nature, and reviv'd what the preceeding hard Sea|&s;on
had caus'd to droop, every Vegetable puts on
new Cloathings, and recovers their wonted Beauty;
each Animal a&s;&s;umes fre&s;h Vigour, the Bea&s;ts in
the Wood leap and bounce for Joy; and each Bird
on the Trees &s;ings for Gladne&s;s, the whole Creation,
is, as it were, repair'd, and every Creature deck'd
with new Life; Love, by Nature's Direction for the
Increa&s;e of every Kind, warms their harmle&s;s Brea&s;ts,
each Animal &s;eeks a Mate, our tame <HI>Antelope</HI>'s quit
their Abode, and range the Woods for the Relief
ordain'd to quell their innocent Pa&s;&s;ion, which being
a&s;&s;wag'd, they return Home, pregnant with Young,
to their Ma&s;ter's great Satisfaction, who having
given them over, was doubly rejoyc'd to &s;ee them
come again in an increa&s;ing Condition; Heaven's
be prais'd, &s;aid he, I &s;hall have a Stock of my own,
and will not fear wanting.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="217">
So having made fitting Preparations again&s;t their
Kidding he goes and examines, the Improvement of
his new Plantation, where he found his Roots grown
full as large as any of tho&s;e that grew wild; make
me thankful, &s;aid he, I am now provided with all
nece&s;&s;ary Food, I &s;hall no more need to rob tho&s;e
poor Creatures, of that, which Nature had provided
for their own proper U&s;e; next he goes and views
his &s;mall Stock of Peas and Beans, which he found
in a very promi&s;ing Ca&s;e; &s;o, whil&s;t the Weather
was fair, he falls a Clearing a Spot of Ground to
to &s;et them in, as they did encrea&s;e.</P>
<P>Turning up the Ground he found &s;everal &s;orts of
Roots, that look'd to be eatable, &s;ome whereof was
as Big as a large Carrot, others left, he broke a Bit
of every one, &s;ome breaking Short and not Stringy,
he judg'd they might be eatable; then he &s;mells
them, and finding the Scent not di&s;agreeable he
ta&s;tes them, &s;ome was &s;weeti&s;h, others &s;harp and
hot like Hor&s;e-Raddi&s;h, and tho&s;e he propo&s;es to
u&s;e in&s;tead of Spice, &s;ure, &s;aid he, the&s;e being of a
plea&s;ant Scent and Savour, cannot be of an offen&s;ive
Nature; &s;o having manur'd his Ground, he takes
a Sample of every Root which he judg'd eatable,
and boils them, as the &s;ure&s;t Way to Experiment
their Goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>They mo&s;t of them prov'd not only pa&s;&s;able good,
but extraordinary; &s;ome eating like Par&s;nips, O|thers
almo&s;t like a Carrot, but rather more agreeable,
&s;ome like Beets and Turnips, every one in their &s;e|veral
Kind, as good as ever he eat in <HI>England,</HI> but
different Colours and Make; &s;ome being Blui&s;h, o|thers
Blank, &s;ome Red, and &s;ome Yellow; the&s;e,
tho' not wanted, having already &s;ufficient to gratify
a nicer Ta&s;te than his, were neverthele&s;s extream|ly
welcome, being &s;omething like his Native Coun|try
Fare and Product: &s;o having return'd Thanks
<PB N="203" REF="218">
for this mo&s;t agreeable Addition to his Ordinary;
he &s;ets a Mark to every Herb which tho&s;e Roots
did bear, in order to get &s;ome of the Seed to &s;ow in
a Ground he would prepare; &s;o being provided
with Fle&s;h, Fi&s;h, Herbs and &s;everal &s;orts of Roots,
he goes and examins what Improvment his Pea&s;e
and Beans had made, which he found increas'd to
Admiration, the &s;even Pea&s;e having produc'd one
thou&s;and, and the three Beans one hundred; hav|ing
return'd Thanks for that va&s;t Increa&s;e, he lies
them by, in Order to &s;et them at a proper Sea&s;on,
as he had done the Year before.</P>
<P>By this time his <HI>Antelopes</HI> had Kidded, one of
them having brought four young Ones, and the
&s;econd three; this va&s;t Adition to his Provi&s;ions
very much rejoyc'd him, being &s;ure now not to
want Fle&s;h at his need, which before he was in
danger of, finding but &s;eldom any thing in his Net;
&s;o makes Account to live upon two of the young
Bucks whil&s;t they la&s;ted, killing one as &s;oon as &s;it
for Meat, and &s;o now and then another, &s;aving
only five to breed, one whereof &s;hould be a Mate
to keep the Females in Rutting-time from the
Wood, lea&s;t, at one time or other they &s;hould &s;tay
away for good and all.</P>
<P>The old Ones being well &s;ed, as he always took
Care to do, providing for them &s;tore of tho&s;e
Greens he knew they lov'd, as al&s;o boil'd Roots for
them now and then, Of which they are very fond;
the young Ones throve a Pace, and did grow very
fat, &s;o, that in three Weeks time they were large
and fit to eat: He kill'd one, which being roa&s;ted,
did prove more delicious than any Hou&s;e-Lamb,
Sucking-Pig, young Faun, or any other Sucklings
whatever.</P>
<P>Having liv'd upon that, with now and then a little
Fi&s;h, about one Month, which was as long as he
<PB N="204" REF="219">
could keep it eatable, having dre&s;s'd it at two differ|ent
times, five Days interval, eating the cold Re|mains
in &s;everal Manners, re&s;erving one of the other
two Males for a Time he &s;hould be &s;canted and
want of Fle&s;h, but was unluckily d&s;appointed by a
Parcel of large Eagles, who flying one Morning o|ver
the Place where the young <HI>Antelopes</HI> playing,
being of a say, as well as active Di&s;po&s;ition, who
lanc'd them&s;elves with Precipitation upon the Male,
he re&s;erv'd for Time of Need, and one of the Fe|males,
which he kept for breed, &s;eeing his beloved
Diverters carrying away by tho&s;e Birds of Prey,
he runs in for his Bow; but came too late with it
the Eagles being gone.</P>
<P>The Lo&s;s of his two dear <HI>Antelopes,</HI> e&s;pecially
the Female, having doom'd the Male for his own
eating, hardly could forbear weeping, to think of
their being cruelly torn to Pieces by tho&s;e ravenous
Creatures: Thus, having for &s;ome Time lamented
his Lo&s;s, and bewail'd their hard Fate, he thinks on
Means to prevent the like Evil, for the Time to
come; and as his Bow was not always at Hand, he
re&s;olves upon making a Net, and fa&s;ten it between
the Trees he law them come in at.</P>
<P>The &s;ucceeding Winter proving very Wet and
Windy, gave him but little Invitation to take his
u&s;ual Walks; &s;o having every Thing he had occa|&s;ion
for at Hand, he kept clo&s;e to his Net-making;
for which, having Twine to twi&s;t, and Thread to
ravel out, to make the &s;aid Twine, kept him im|ploy'd
till the following Spring, which came on a
pace.</P>
<P>Having fini&s;h'd his Net, and every Thing as did
belong to't, he goes and fa&s;tens it to the Trees, as
he had propos'd; then takes a Walk to his new
Plantations, which he found in a thriving Conditi|on;
for which, and other Benefits already receiv'd,
<PB N="205" REF="220">
he re&s;olves, as in Duty bound, to attend at his
u&s;ual Place of Wor&s;hip, and &s;ing Thank&s;giving
P&s;alms, which the Hardne&s;s of the Weather had
kept him from all the late Winter; but coming into
his Mind, that whil&s;t he was at his Deuotion, re|turning
Thanks for the fair Pro&s;pect of a plentiful
Crop, his <HI>Antelope</HI>'s would break into the Clo&s;e, the
Hedge being as yet, but thin, and devour the pro|mi&s;ing
Buds, which are the principle Occa&s;ion of
his Devotion: This not altogether unproper Con&s;i|deration,
puts a &s;ad Check to his Religious Intenti|on;
and tho', there was a va&s;t Obligation, to prompt
him to the Performance of that Part of his Duty,
yet he could not, with Wi&s;dom, run the Hazard, out
of meer Devotion, to lo&s;e &s;o promi&s;ing a Crop,
which he &s;hould never be able to retrieve, all his
Stock of Seed being then in Gra&s;s.</P>
<P>As he was debating in his Mind, between Reli|gion
and Rea&s;on, whether the Latter ought not to
be a Director to the Fir&s;t, he perceiv'd his <HI>Ante|lopes</HI>
making towards the Pea&s;e, where, they doubt|le&s;s
would have got in, had he not return'd, and
drove them another way, which Accident did con|vince
him he might find a more proper Time to go
about his Devotion, no Man being required to wor|&s;hip
to his Prejudice; &s;o, having put off his religi|ous
Duty, till he had better &s;ecur'd his Pea&s;e and
Beans, he cuts a parcel of Branches, wherewith he
&s;tops tho&s;e Gaps, to prevent the Creatures going
in; &s;o having compleated his Work, he goes to his
Devotion, adding to his u&s;ual Thank&s;giving, a par|ticular
Collect for his lucky being in the Way, to
prevent his being fru&s;trated of the Ble&s;&s;ing Heaven
&s;o fairly promis'd to be&s;tow on his Labours.</P>
<P>Having paid his Devotion, he walks about the
I&s;land, being all the Way delighted with the Birds
celebrating their Maker's Prai&s;e, in their different
<PB N="207" REF="221">
harmonious Notes, every Thing in Nature, &s;aid
he, an&s;wers the End of their Creation, but ungrate|ful
man! Who, ambitious to be wi&s;e as his Creator,
only learns to make him&s;elf wretched; &s;o walks
till the Evening, making &s;everal Reflections on the
different Conditions of Men, e&s;teeming his pre&s;ent
State to that of <HI>Adam</HI> before his Fall, who could
not be &s;en&s;ible of Happine&s;s, having never known a
Rever&s;e, otherwi&s;e he would have been more care|ful
to prevent; &s;o being come Home, and near Bed|time,
he fir&s;t eats his Supper, and them having per|form'd
his cu&s;tomary religious Service, he goes to
Bed, and the next Morning, after paying his u&s;ual
Devotion, he takes a Walk to his Plantations, on
which he implores a Continuation of the pro&s;perous
Condition they appear to be in; next he goes to ex|amine
his new Nets, in which he finds a Brace of
Fowls like Ducks, but as large again, and exceeding
beautiful, the Drake (which he knew by a colour'd
Feather on his Rump) was of a fine Cinamon Co|lour
upon his Back, his Brea&s;t of a Mazarine Blue,
the Belly of a deep Orange, his Neck Green, Head
Purple, his Eyes, Bill and Feet Red, every Colour
changing mo&s;t agreeable as they mov'd; the Duck
was al&s;o very beautiful, but of quite different Co|lours,
much paler than the Drake's.</P>
<P>The Di&s;apointment in catching tho&s;e delightful
Fowls in&s;tead of ravenous Eagles, as he did purpo&s;e,
no ways di&s;pleas'd him, but rather was rejoyc'd to
have &s;uch beautiful Fowls to look at; yet, it went
much again&s;t his Mind, to deprive tho&s;e Creatures
of their Liberty (the greate&s;t Comforts in Life)
whom Nature took &s;uch Pains to adorn; but, &s;aid
he, they were created for the U&s;e of Man; &s;o, in
keeping them for my Plea&s;ure, they will but an&s;wer
the End of their Creation, their Confinement &s;hall
be no &s;tricter than my own, they &s;hall have the
<PB N="206" REF="222">
whole I&s;land to range in; &s;o he pinions them, and
puts them in the Pond; then makes Baskets for
them to &s;helter in, which he places in the Branches
of tho&s;e Trees that hung clo&s;e&s;t to the Water, ta|king
particular Care to feed them daily with Roots
roa&s;ted and boil'd; and the Guts of the Fi&s;hes, and
other Creatures, he us'd for his own eating, which
made them thrive mainly, and take to the Place; &s;o
that they bred in their Sea&s;on.</P>
<P>The five Antelopes had, by this Time, kindled
and brought &s;ixteen young ones: His Pea&s;e and
Beans al&s;o were wonderfully improv'd, having that
Sea&s;on enough to &s;tock the Ground the Year fol|lowing.
Thus he return'd kind Providence Thanks
for that va&s;t Encrea&s;e, and concludes to live upon
the young Antelopes as long as they la&s;ted, re&s;erv|ing
only one, for Suck of the old ones, to keep them
in Milk, of which he had taken Notice they were
very flu&s;h, de&s;igning to draw it daily for his own
U&s;e; &s;o that, in a little Time he had enough to
skim for Cream, which he did u&s;e for Saufe in|&s;tead
of Butter, and made &s;mall Chee&s;es with the
re&s;t: Now having a pretty Store;of Dary-Ware, he
re&s;olves to make a Place to keep it in; the Kitchen
wherein he was oblig'd to lay his Salt-Fi&s;h (which
commonly &s;mells &s;trong) not being a proper Place
for Cream and milk, &s;o makes a Dairy-Hou&s;e at the
other Side of his Dwelling, with Branches of Trees,
after the Manner of a clo&s;s Arbour, and thatches it
over with Gra&s;s; which an&s;wering the Kitchen in
Form and Situation, made uniform Wings, that
added as much to the Beauty as Conveniency of
the Habitation.</P>
<P>So having compleated his Dairy, he proceeds in
his Re&s;olution of making Chee&s;e, having learn'd the
Way in <HI>Holland;</HI> and for Want of Runnet to turn
his Milk, he takes &s;ome of the Hor&s;e-Rardice Seed,
<PB N="208" REF="223">
which, being of a hot Nature, had the &s;ame Effect;
&s;o having Curd to his Mind, he &s;ea&s;ons it to his Pa|late;
then with his Hatchet, he cuts a Notch round
in the Bark of a Tree, about eighteen Inches in Cir|cumference,
and a &s;econd in the &s;ame Manner &s;ix In|ches
below that; then &s;lits the Circle, and with
his Knife gently opens it, &s;o parts it from the Tree;
thus he makes as many Hoops as he judg'd would
contain his Pa&s;te, which being girded round with
Cords to keep them from opening, he fills with the
&s;aid, and lays them by, till &s;it to eat; ob&s;erving
the &s;ame Method he had taken Notice they did
whom he &s;aw make them.</P>
<P>This being done which compleated his Provi&s;ions,
he returns Thanks for tho&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings which
he had been &s;o liberally be&s;tow'd on him; now, &s;aid
he, Heavens be prais'd, I exceed a Prince in Happi|ne&s;s;
I have a Habitation &s;trong and la&s;ting, beau|tiful
and convenient free Hold, a Store of Com|forts,
with all Nece&s;&s;aries of Life, free-co&s;t, which
I enjoy with Peace undi&s;turbable, and Plea&s;ure un|controll'd;
yet, I think there is &s;till &s;omething wan|ting
to complete my Happine&s;s, if a Partner in
Grief le&s;&s;ens Sorrow, certainly it mu&s;t in Delight
augment the Plea&s;ures. What Objects of Admira|tion
are here conceal'd, and like a Mi&s;er's Trea&s;ure,
hid from the World! if Man, who was created for
Bli&s;s, could have been compleatly happy alone, he
would not have had a Companion given him; &s;o
walks about thoughtful till Bed-Time; Sleep, &s;ays
he, which un&s;its Men for Company, is the fitte&s;t
State for me who can get none, &s;o that I could un|der
its dark Shades pa&s;s away the Remainder of
my lone&s;ome Life, tho&s;e anxious Hours, which

a&s;leep: The Night al&s;o being windy added to his
heavy Di&s;po&s;ition; but his di&s;turbed Mind finds no
Repo&s;e, it &s;till runs on upon the Subject, that took
it up the Day before, and forms Ideas &s;uitable to
its Inclination; and as Solitude was the Motive of
its being di&s;turbed, he indulges it with the Thoughts
of Company, &s;o dreams that the Fame of his Stati|on,
and happy State of Life was &s;pread about the
World, that it did prompt a va&s;t Number of Peo|ple
from all Parts to come to it, which at la&s;t did
enduce &s;everal Princes to claim a Right to it, which
being decided by a bloody War, a Governor was
&s;ent, who laid Taxes, demanded Duties, rais'd
Rents, and warns him to be gone (having fix'd upon
his Habitation for him&s;elf to dwell in, being &s;adly
di&s;turbed with that Dream) he cries out in his
Sleep, This is a great Puni&s;hment for my Unea&s;i|ne&s;s;
could I not be contented with being Lord of
this I&s;land, without provoking Heavens to bring
me under the Power of extorting Governors.</P>
<P>There happening a great Noi&s;e, he &s;tarts out of
his Sleep, with the Thought of hearing a Proclama|tion,
cry'd out, Alas! &s;aid he, 'tis too late to pro|claim
an Evil which is already come; but being
throughly awake, and the Noi&s;e &s;till continuing, he
found he had been dreaming, which very much re|$oic'd
him; &s;o puts on his Cloaths, and ha&s;tens to
the Pleace he heard the Noi&s;e come from.</P>
<P>Being within forty or fifty Yards thereof, he
$aw a Number of Monkeys of two different Kinds,
the one Sort &s;queeling and fighting again&s;t the o|ther,
without intermixing, but &s;till rallying as they
&s;catter'd in the Scuffle. He &s;tood &s;ometime admir|ing
the Order they kept in, and the Battle &s;till conti|$uing
as fierce as at fir&s;t, he advanc'd to &s;ee what
$hey fought about; for he took Notice they very
$uch &s;trove to keep their Ground.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="225">
At his approach the Battle ceas'd, and the Com|batants
retiring at &s;ome Di&s;tance, left the Spot of
Ground, on which they fought, clear, whereon lay
a con&s;iderable Quantity of wild Pomgranates, the
Wind had &s;hook off the Trees the Night before,
which were the Occa&s;ion of their Strife.</P>
<P>His coming having caus'd a Truce, every one of
tho&s;e Creatures keeping &s;till and quiet during his
&s;tay, he re&s;olves to u&s;e his Endeavours to make a
through Peace; and as that Difference did ari&s;e
from the Fruit there pre&s;ent, to which he could &s;ee
no Rea&s;on, but that each Kind had an equal Right,
he devides it in tow even Parcels, which he lays
oppo&s;ite to each other towards both the Parties; &s;o
retir'd a little Way, to &s;ee whether his Expedient
&s;hould decide the Quarrel, which an&s;wer'd his In|tent,
tho&s;e Animals quietly coming to that Share
next to them, and peaceably carries it away, each
to their Quarters; this occa&s;ion'd &s;everal Reflecti|ons
on the frivolous, and often unju&s;t Quarrels that
ari&s;e among Princes, which create &s;uch bloody
Wars, as prove the De&s;truction of va&s;t Numbers of
their Subjects; if Monarchs, &s;aid he, did always
act with as much Rea&s;on as the&s;e Creatures, how
much Blood and Money would they &s;ave? Thus
goes on to his u&s;ual Place of Wor&s;hip, in order to
return Thanks, that he was free of that Evil, the
Dream, whereof he had &s;o tortur'd his Mind, tho'
he confes'd he ju&s;tly de&s;erv'd the Reality, for his

<P>Having pay'd his Devotion, he takes a Walk to &s;ee

an Hours walk to his Bed, &s;o &s;lept quietly all Night,
being ea&s;y in his Mind.</P>
<P>The next Morning he takes his u&s;ual Walks, and
vi&s;its his Nets; in that he had &s;et for Eagles, he
found a Fowl as big as a Turkey, but the Colour
of a Phea&s;ant, only a Tail like a Partridge; this
having no Sign of being a Bird of Prey, was loath

tenderer and fuller of Gravey.</P>
<P>Tho' he was very well pleas'd with the Bird he
had taken, yet he had rather it had been one of the
Eagles, which held his young Antelopes in Jeopardy,
but as he could not de&s;troy them with his Net,
which had hung a con&s;iderable Time without the
intended Succe&s;s, he proiects the Prevention of their
Encrea&s;e, by de&s;troying their Eggs, &s;o leaves his
Nets wholy for the U&s;e they had been &s;ucce&s;sful in,
and &s;earches the Clifts of the Rock next to the Sea,
where tho&s;e Birds commonly build, and having
found &s;everal Ne&s;ts, he takes away the Eggs that
were in them (being then their breeding-time) &s;o
carries them Home, in order to empty the Shells,
and hang them up and down in his Habitation, a|mong&s;t
the green Leaves which cover'd the Ceiling
thereof; but having accidently broke one, and the
Yolk and White thereof being like that of a Turkey,
he had the Curio&s;ity to boil one and ta&s;te it, which
eat much after the manner of a Swans, the re&s;t he
&s;av'd to eat now and then for a Change, &s;o reaps a

thereby the Damage they might do him in Time
and adding a Di&s;h to his pre&s;ent Fare.</P>
<P>In this pro&s;perous way he liv'd fifteen Years, find|ing
no Alteration in the Weather or Sea&s;ons, nor
happening all the Time any Tran&s;actions worthy of

taking his u&s;ual Walks with all the Content and Sa|tisfaction
his happy Condition could procure, in|tirely

<P><PB N="215" REF="230">
Thus having walk'd the I&s;land over and over,
which, tho' delightful, yet the often Repetition of
the Wonders it produces, renders them, as it were,
common and le&s;s admirable, &s;o he proceeds to view
the Sea, who&s;e fluid Element being ever in Motion
daily afords new Objects of wonder.</P>
<P>The Day being very fair, and the Weather as

<P>As he was making Reflections on the emptyne&s;s

Heavens thanks that he was from the World, which
abounds in nothing el&s;e. A Ship appears at a great
Di&s;tance, a Sight he had not &s;een &s;ince his Ship|wreck;

The Men on Board, had '&s;py'd him out with their
Per&s;pective-Gla&s;&s;es, and &s;uppo&s;ing him to be a Ship|wreck
that wanted Relief, &s;ent their Long-Boat with

his Rea&s;on, and makes him a Stranger to his own
Inclination, which &s;trugling with his wavering Re|&s;olution,
occa&s;ions a Debate between Hope and Fear;
but the Boat being come pretty nigh gave Hope
the Advantage, and made his late Re&s;olution yield
to his reviv'd Inclination, which being now encou|raged
by a probable Opportunity of being an&s;wer'd
ru&s;hes on to Execution, quitting all his former Re|liance
on Providence, depends altogether upon his
getting away, ble&s;&s;ing the lucky Opportunity of
&s;eeing his Native Country again, for which Plea|&s;ure
he freely quits and for&s;akes all the Happine&s;s he
did enjoy, gladly abandoning his delightful Habita|tion
and plentiful I&s;land, &s;o thinks no more of Pro|vidence,

greate&s;t Probabilities, &s;natches Succe&s;s out of his
Hand before he could gra&s;p it, &s;o intercepts his
thought-infallible Retreat, the Boat could not ap|proach
him, by rea&s;on of the Rocks running a great
way into the Sea under Water, nor could come at the
Boat for &s;harp Points and deep Holes, which made
it unfordable as well as unnavigable; &s;o that after
&s;everal Hours &s;triving in vain on both &s;ides, to come
at one another; the Men, after they had &s;trove all
the could but to no purpo&s;e, &s;aid &s;omething to him

de&s;pis'd Heaven's Bounties, which had
been &s;o largly be&s;tow'd on him, he has forfeited all
hopes of A&s;&s;i&s;tance from thence, and expects not

he falls a Weeping; could I &s;hed a Flood of Tears,

adieu infectious World, thou Magician of Iniquity!
the Thoughts of which are now more offen&s;ive

va&s;t large Mon&s;ter, rai&s;ing out of the Water, with
its terrible Jaws wide open, looking at him in a
mo&s;t dreadful manner, &s;top'd the Execution of his
de&s;perate De&s;ign: Thus, Death appearing in a dif|ferent
Shape than he had propos'd to meet him in,
frightens away his re&s;olution of dying: I may,
&s;aid he, condemn my &s;elf, but Vengeance belongs to
God alone, who rejects not Tears of Repentance;
but always extends his Mercies towards the Peni|tent;
and &s;ince St. <HI>Peter,</HI> after thrice denying his
LORD and MASTER, was by repenting and weeping
over his Sin, received again into favour; &s;o I
hope the&s;e my weak but &s;incere Tokens of Repen|tance
will be accepted off, for ever divorcing my&s;elf
from the World, and never think of its alluring
Plea&s;ures, but to de&s;pi&s;e them: And for the better
performance of that pious Re&s;olution, he &s;ets that
woeful Day apart (in which he did commit that
fatal Deed) for Prayer and Fa&s;ting: Thus he went
Home, and having eat nothing &s;ince the Day be|fore,
he &s;pent the Remainder of that in fa&s;ting and
praying, &s;inging penitential P&s;alms till dark Night,
that Nature urg'd him to repo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="233">
The Pains and Labour he had been at in the Days
climbing up and down the Rock, draging him&s;elf
to and through, to come at the Boat, having very
much rack'd his Limbs, and the Di&s;appointment of
his full Dependance on the &s;aid prom&s;ing succe&s;s;
as al&s;o the tormenting Remor&s;e, and heavy Grief
for his &s;inful Reliance thereon, did much fatigue his
Mind, render'd Sleep, which is ordain'd for the
Refre&s;hment of Nature, of no Manner of Help to
him; his Thoughts are continually di&s;turb'd with
frightful Vi&s;ions, all his pa&s;t Dangers glare at him,
as if threatning their Return; but that which terri|fied
him mo&s;t was the frightful Idea of the terrible
Mon&s;ter, which did ri&s;e out of the Sea at that In|&s;tant
he was going to plunge him&s;elf in it.</P>
<P>Being awak'd out of his re&s;tle&s;s Sleep, rather
more fatigu'd than when he lay down, having &s;till
the terrible A&s;pect of the Sea Mon&s;ter in his Mind,
he made &s;everal Reflections on the execrable Na|ture
of his intended Sin, admiring the immen&s;e
Goodne&s;s of Providence, who, to deter him from the
committing of the enormous Act, did order that
(pa&s;t-Imagination) terrible Object, as the mo&s;t &s;uit|able
to the Barbarity of his De&s;ign, to &s;trike in him
that Terror which the Gender of Death he had
fix'd upon could could not. Thus having with
Tears acknowledg'd the Enormity of his Re&s;oluti|on,
he returns Providence Thanks for its ine&s;ti|mable
Goodne&s;s, who (notwith&s;tanding his late
mo&s;t ungrateful Elopement) did pre&s;erve him from
eternal, as well as temporal Ruin; &s;o haing paid his
Devotion, and &s;ung a thank&s;giving P&s;alm, he takes a
little Nouri&s;hment, his Spirits being low with his
pa&s;t Fatigue and Fa&s;ting; and as he could not put
out of his Eyes the terrible A&s;pect of the Mon&s;ter,
which being beyond any Chimerical Conception, he
re&s;olves to draw it according to the Idea he had in

a wild Goats, two more bending backwards; it's

the Mouth of a Lyon, and Teeth of a Panther; the
Fences of an Elephant, and the Tusks of a wild
Boar; &s;houlder'd like a Giant, with Claws like an
Eagle, body'd and cover'd with Shells like a Rino|cero$s,
and the Colour of a Crocodile.</P>
<P>Having &s;imiled every different Part, he proceeds
in the Repre&s;entation thereof; which being fini&s;h'd,
put him in the greate&s;t of Admirations: Sure, &s;aid
he, if Nature had a Hand in thy making it was to
a&s;&s;ume in one Creature, all that the fierce&s;t and
dreadfule&s;t Animals, that are mo&s;t frightful and ter|rible;
now perhaps, this being con&s;tantly before me,
may come le&s;s in my Mind; &s;o fixes it again&s;t his

my late VOW, never to endeavour, or wi&s;h to go
from hence, what ever Opportunity offers, tho' at|tended
with never &s;o great a Probability of Succe&s;s
and Pro&s;pect of Gain; fully &s;ettling his whole Mind
and Affection on the State and Condition Heavens
has been pleas'd to place him in, re&s;olving to let
nothing enter into his Thoughts, but his mo&s;t
grateful Duty to &s;o great a Benefactor, who
<PB N="220" REF="235">

<P>Thus having entirely bani&s;h'd the World out of
his Mind, which before often di&s;turb'd it, he limits
his Thoughts within the Bounds of his ble&s;&s;ed Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion,
which affords him more than is &s;ufficient to
make his Life happy, where Plenty flows on him,
and Plea&s;ure attends his De&s;ires, abounding in all
Things that can gratifie his Appetite, or delight
his Fancy: A Herd of delightful <HI>Antelopes</HI> bouncing
and playing about his Habitation divert him at

Harmony of diver&s;e Kinds of &s;inging Birds; every
Place he comes at offers him new Objects for Plea|&s;ure:
Thus all &s;eems to concur in compleating his
Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>In this mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed State he thinks him&s;elf as

only that every Thing may continue in its pre|&s;ent

their Turn, Which Con&s;iderations mu&s;t for the

tender Con&s;titution &s;u&s;ceptible to the Cold; there|fore
the Cloaths he was ca&s;t away in being worn
out, he is oblig'd to think of providing &s;omething
to defend his Limbs from the Hardne&s;s of the ap|proaching
Winter, whil&s;t it is yet warm; &s;o having
con&s;ider'd what to make a Wrapper of, he concludes
upon u&s;ing &s;ome of the &s;ame Gra&s;s he made his Mats
of, on which he lay, being &s;oft and warm, very fit
for that Purpo&s;e; &s;o he goes and cuts down a &s;uffi|cient
Quantity, which, when ready to work, he
makes &s;mall Twine with, and plats it in narrow
Breeds, which he &s;ues together with &s;ome of the

&s;ame, and &s;o &s;hapes a long loo&s;e Gown that cover'd
him to his Heels, and a Cap of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>By that Time he had fini&s;h'd his Winter-Garb,
the Weather was grown cold enough for him to put
it on; the fro&s;ty Sea&s;on came on apace, in which
there fell &s;uch a Quantity of snow that he was
forc'd to make a Broom and &s;weep it away from a|bout
his Habitation twice a Day; as al&s;o the &s;ame
he made to the Places he had Occa&s;ion to go to,
to&s;&s;ing the Snow on each Side, which before the
Winter was over did meet a Top; and &s;o cover'd
it all the Way, which oblig'd him to keep within
Doors for a con&s;iderable Time, and melt Snow in|&s;tead
of Water, lea&s;t going for &s;ome he might chance
to be buried among the Snow.</P>
<P>The Winter being over, and the Snow di&s;&s;olv'd,
the gay Spring advances apace, offering Nature its
u&s;ual A&s;&s;i&s;tance, repairing the Damages the late
Fro&s;t had done, which joyful Tidings made every
Thing &s;mile; <HI>Quarll</HI> al&s;o finds him&s;elf reviv'd,
did take his former Walks, which the preceeding
bad Weather had kept him from, tho there had been
no con&s;iderable Storm the Winter before.</P>
<P>He having a Mind to view the Sea, being come
to the Out&s;ide of the North-we&s;t End of the Rock,
he &s;ees at the Foot thereof &s;omething like Part of
the Body of a large hollow Tree, the Ends whereof
were &s;top'd with its own Pitch, and the Middle,
which was &s;lit open from End to End, and kept
gaping by a Stick laid a cro&s;s.</P>
<P>This put him in mind of Canoes which the <HI>Indi|ans</HI>
paddle up and down their Lakes and Rivers with,
and being on that Side of the Rock next to the
I&s;land <HI>California,</HI> he fancy'd &s;ome of them were come
to vi&s;it his I&s;land, tho' not many in Number, their
Canoes holding, at the mo&s;t, but two Men, and for
the Generality one only; yet as &s;ome of the&s;e Peo|ple
<PB N="222" REF="237">
are accounted great Thieves, daily robbing one
another, he ha&s;tens Home to &s;ecure what he had,
but was too late; they had been there already, and
had taken away the Cloaths he found in the Che&s;t,
which being, by far, too little for him, hung need|le&s;s
on a Pin behing his Door; had they been con|tented
with that, he would have found no Mi&s;s; but
they carried away &s;ome of his fine Shells, and what
griev'd him mo&s;t, the fine Bird he had taken &s;uch
Pains to dre&s;s and &s;tuff, and Care to pre&s;erve, as al|&s;o
his Bow and Arrows.</P>
<P>Having mi&s;s'd the&s;e Things which he much valu|ed,
he ha&s;tens to the Out&s;ide of the Rock, with his
long Staff in his Hand, in Hopes to light on them
before they could get into their Canoe; but hap|pen'd
to come too late, they being already got near
Half a League from the Rock; yet they did not car|ry
away their Theft, there ari&s;ing &s;ome Wind,
which made the Sea &s;omething rough, did over&s;et
their Canoe, &s;o that what was in it was all lo&s;t, but
the two <HI>Indians,</HI> who mo&s;t dexterou&s;ly turn'd it on
its Bottom again, and with unexprimable Activity
leapt in it, one at the one Side, and the other at
the oppo&s;ite, &s;o the Canoe being trim'd at once,
they paddled out of his Sight.</P>
<P>Having &s;een as much of them as he could, he
walks to the North-ea&s;t Side, in Order to &s;ee if he
could perceive any Effect of the high Wind which
happen'd the Night before.</P>
<P>Being come to the Out&s;ide of the Rock, he per|ceives
at a Di&s;tance &s;omething like a large Che&s;t,
but having no Lid on't, taking that to be the Pro|duct
of &s;ome late Shipwrack, he greiv'd at the fatal
Accident; How long, &s;aid he, will covetou&s;ne&s;s de|coy
Men to pur&s;ue Wealth at the Co&s;t of their
precious Life? has not Nature provided every Na|tion
and Country Sufficiency for its Inhabitants,
<PB N="223" REF="238">
that they mo&s;t rove on this mo&s;t dangerous and
perilous Sea, which may be titled <HI>Death's Dominions,</HI>
many peri&s;hing thereon, and not one on it being
&s;afe.</P>
<P>As he was bewailing their Fate whom he ima|gin'd
had been ca&s;t away, he &s;ees two Men come
down the Rock, with each a Bundle in his Arms,
who went to that which he had taken to be a Che&s;t,
and having put their Load in it, pu&s;h'd it away till
come to deeper Water; then having got in it, with
a long Staff &s;hov'd it off, till they could row to a
Long-boat that lay at &s;ome Di&s;tance behind a jot|ting
Part of the Rock, which &s;creen'd it from his
Sight, as al&s;o the Ship it did belong to.</P>
<P>The Sight of this much &s;urpriz'd him, and made
him cea&s;e condolling others &s;uppos'd Lo&s;s, to run
Home and examine his own, well knowing tho&s;e
Bundles he &s;aw carried away mu&s;t needs belong to
him, there being no other Moveables in the I&s;land,
but what was in his Lodge.</P>
<P>Being come Home he finds indeed what he &s;u&s;|pected,
tho&s;e Villains had mo&s;t &s;acrilegiou&s;ly rifled
and ran&s;ack'd his Habitation, not leaving him &s;o
much as one of the Mats to keep him poor Body
from the Ground; his Winter-Garb al&s;o is gone,
and what el&s;e they could find for their U&s;e.</P>
<P>The Lo&s;s of tho&s;e Things which he could not be
without, fill'd him with Sorrow; Now, &s;aid he,
I am in my fir&s;t State of Being, naked I came into
the World, and naked &s;hall I go out of't, &s;o fell a|weeping.</P>
<P>Having griev'd a while, Why, &s;aid he &s;hould I
thus ca&s;t my &s;elf down? is not Providence, who
gave me them, able to give me more? &s;o having re|&s;olv'd
before Winter to repleni&s;h his Lo&s;s, he re&s;ts
him&s;elf contented, and gives the Ruffians evil Acti|on
the be&s;t Con&s;truction he could. Now I think

on't, &s;aid he, the&s;e &s;urely are the Men, who about
twelve Months &s;ince, would charitably have carried
me hence, but could not for Want of nece&s;&s;ary Im|plements,
and now, being better provided, come to
accompli&s;h their ho&s;pitable De&s;ign; but not finding
me, &s;uppos'd I was either dead or gone; &s;o took
away what was here of no U&s;e; much good may
what they have got do them, and may it be of as
much U&s;e to them as it was to me: Thus walks out
in Order to cut Gra&s;s to dry, and make him&s;elf new
Bedding and a Winter-Garb.</P>
<P>Having walk'd about Half a Mile, he perceives
the &s;ame Men coming towards the Pond, Heavens
be prais'd &s;aid he, here they be &s;till; now
when they &s;ee I am not gone, nor willing to go
they will return my Things, which they are &s;en|&s;ible
I cannot do without; &s;o goes up to them.</P>
<P>By that Time they had catch'd his two old
Ducks, which being pingion'd could not fly away as
the re&s;t did: He was much vex'd to &s;ee the be&s;t of
his Stock thus taken away, yet as he thought they
were come to do him Service, he could grudge them
nothing, as would anywi&s;e gratifie &s;o good an In|tent;
&s;o having return'd them Thanks for their
good Will, he told them he was very happy in the
I&s;land, &s;o made a Vow never to go out of it.</P>
<P>The&s;e being <HI>French</HI> Men, and of an Employ|ment,
where their Politene&s;s is of little U&s;e, being
Fi&s;hermen, not under&s;tanding what he &s;aid, only
laugh'd in his Face, thus went on to the Purpo&s;e they
came about; &s;o having as many of the Ducks as
they could get, they proceeded towards the Hou&s;e,
where they had &s;een the <HI>Antelopes,</HI> &s;ome of which
not running away at their Approach, they propos'd
to catch hold of them.</P>
<P>Being come to the Place where the us'd to &s;eed,
which was near the Dwelling, the young ones not
<PB N="225" REF="240">
being us'd to &s;ee any Men in Cloathes, nor any Bo|dy
but their Ma&s;ter, pre&s;ently fled, but the two
old Ones, which he had bred up, were &s;o tame, that
notwith&s;tanding of the Strangers, they &s;tood &s;till;
only when the Men come to them, they crept clo&s;s
to him, which gave the Men Opportunity to lay
Hold on them, who, notwith&s;tanding <HI>Quarll</HI>'s beg|ging
and praying, they tied a Halter about their
Horns, and &s;o barbarou&s;ly led them away.</P>
<P><HI>Quarll</HI> was griev'd to the Heart to &s;ee his Dar|lings,
which he had taken &s;uch Care to breed up,
and who were become the principal Part of his De|light,
following him up and down, and by their
jumping and playing before him, often di&s;pers'd me|lancholly
Thoughts, all the&s;e endearing Qualificati|ons
augmented his Grief to &s;ee them thus hail'd a|way:
He weeps, and on his Knees begs they may
be left; and tho they under&s;tood not his Words,
his Actions were &s;o expre&s;&s;ive and moving, that
had they had the Humanity of Canabals, which
eat one another, they would have yielded to &s;o
melting an Object, as the poor broken hearted <HI>Quarll</HI>
was; but the inflexible Boors went on, cruely hall|ing
and draging the poor Creatures, who, as tho'
&s;en&s;ible of the Barbarity of the Act, did look back
to their afflicted Ma&s;ter, as craving his A&s;&s;i&s;tance,
which at la&s;t &s;o exa&s;perated him, that he was &s;eve|ral
Times tempted to lay on the Ravi&s;hers with his
long Staff; but as often was &s;topt by the following
Con&s;ideration, Shall I, &s;aid he, be the De&s;truction
of my fellow-Creature, to re&s;cue out of their Hands
Animals, of which I have an improving Store left,
and deprive them of their Healths, and perhaps of
their Lives, to recover what co&s;ts me nought? l$$
them go with what they have, and the Merit of
their Deed be their Reward. Thus he walks about
melancholy, bemoaning his poor <HI>Antelopes</HI> Fate, and
<PB N="226" REF="241">
his own Misfortune; They were us'd to Liberty,
&s;aid he, which they now are depriv'd of, and &s;o
which they will pine and die, which for their Sake
I cannot but wi&s;h, for Life without Liberty is a con|tinual
Death, which holds during Life.</P>
<P>As he was walking thinking, as 'tis u&s;ual, after
the Lo&s;s of any Thing one loves, of the Plea&s;ure
he had during the Enjoyment, the Ruffians, having
&s;ecur'd the poor Animals, came back with Ropes in
their Hands. What do they want next, &s;aid he,
have they not all they de&s;ire? would they carry a|way
my Habitation al&s;o? &s;ure they have no De|&s;ign
on my Per&s;on, if &s;o they will not take it &s;o
ea&s;ily as they did my dear <HI>Antelopes;</HI> thus re&s;olv'd
to exerci&s;e his Quarter-Staff, if they offer'd to lay
Hands on him. The Villains, who&s;e De&s;ign was to
bind him, and &s;o carry him away, &s;eeing him arm'd
and re&s;olute, did not judge it &s;afe for them to ad|vance
within the Reach of his Weapon, but keep
at &s;ome Di&s;tance, divining how to &s;eize him.</P>
<P><HI>Quarll,</HI> who by their con&s;ulting, gue&s;t at their
De&s;ign, did not think proper to let them come to a
Re&s;olution, &s;o makes at the neare&s;t, who immedi|ately
takes to his Heels, and then to the next, who
immediately does the &s;ame; thus he follows them
about for a con&s;iderable Time; but they divided in
Order to trie him with running, till the Night ap|proaching,
and the Wind ri&s;ing, made them fear
their Retreat might be dangerous, if they deferr'd it;
&s;o they went clear away, which being all he de|&s;ir'd,
he return'd a&s;&s;oon as he &s;aw them in their
Long-boat, which they row'd to their Ship that lay
at Anchor &s;ome Di&s;tance from the Rocks.</P>
<P>The&s;e Wretches being gone, he returns Heavens
Thanks for his Deliverance; and as his Bridge had
favour'd their coming, he pulls it off, and only laid
it over when he had a Mind to view the Sea; &s;o
<PB N="227" REF="242">
goes Home to eat a Bit, having not as yet broke his
Fa&s;t; &s;o having eaten &s;ome of his Roots and Chee&s;e,
and being wearied with hunting tho&s;e Boors, he con|&s;ults
how to lie, his Bed and Beding being gone; as
al&s;o his Winter-Gown, and the Nights being as yet
cold; &s;o, after a &s;mall Time of Con&s;ideration, he
concludes to lie in the Lodge, which was left vacant
by the &s;tolen <HI>Antelopes</HI> Ab&s;ennce, who&s;e Litter be|ing
made of the &s;ame Gra&s;s as his Mats were of, he
lay both &s;oft and warm.</P>
<P>When laid down, being &s;ore fatigu'd he &s;oon fell
a&s;leep; and as the Plunderers had the precceding
Day took up his Cares, they fill'd his Mind in the
Night; he has them continually before his Eyes,
&s;ometimes with his beloved Antelopes in their pilfer|ing
Hands, as other Times, barbarou&s;ly hawling
them by the Horns, with a Halter, which they
ought to have about their own Necks. The&s;e
Acts of Au&s;terity provoke his Anger, and urge him
on to Revenge; thus he lifts his Staff, which of a
&s;udden is turn'd into <HI>Hercules</HI>'s Club, &s;tartl'd to &s;ee
that wonderful Change, he &s;tops from laying on the
intended Blow; re&s;cuing, &s;aid he, my darling Ani|mals
I &s;hall lo&s;e my mo&s;t pretious and ine&s;timable
Peace of Mind, what can attone for the Life of a
Man? Whil&s;t he was making tho&s;e Reflections, the
Men got clear away with the Fowls and <HI>Antelopes,</HI>
&s;o left him in deep melancholly. Thus as he was
bewailing his Lo&s;s, calling to Mind the agreeable
Pa&s;times they had often been to him, and the many
anxious Hours he had di&s;pers'd with their Diver&s;i|on,
a grave Gentlewoman appear'd before him, of a
mo&s;t agreeable, yet demure Countenance, dre&s;s'd in
plain Dove-colour'd Cloathes, in mo&s;t Places
thread-bare, and in others patch'd with dive&s;e Sorts
of Stuffs, yet genteel and becoming; he &s;tarts at
her Appearing, wondering what &s;he could come for,
<PB N="228" REF="243">
having nothing more to lo&s;e. I come not, &s;aid &s;he,
to &s;eek ought from thee, but to re&s;tore what thou
ha&s;t lo&s;t. He being overjoy'd at the Words, looks
about expecting his beloved <HI>Antelopes,</HI> and what el&s;e
the Men had taken away; but &s;eeing nothing, he
thought that Vi&s;ion proceeded from Vapours, which
the great Grief for his late Lo&s;s had occa&s;ion'd, &s;o
falls a thinking till being a &s;econd Time interrupted
by her, bidding him look her in the Face. Be &s;a|tisfied,
be &s;atisfied Woman, &s;aid he, why I neither
know thee nor what thou meane&s;t. Well then, re|ply'd
&s;he, I'll inform thee of both; I am Patience,
whom all the World &s;trive to grieve, and whom
none can provoke, and what I promi&s;e to re&s;tore
thee is Content, which you throw away after
worthle&s;s Things; &s;o &s;he evani&s;hes, at which he a|wakes.</P>
<P>Having made Reflections upon the latter Part of
his Dream, the fir&s;t Part thereof being but a Repe|tition
of what happen'd the Days before, he makes
this Application; This, &s;aid he, is a Check for my
di&s;compo&s;ing that Peace upon &s;uch a freevolous
Account, which by Providence was intended I
&s;hould enjoy, having &s;upplied me with all Nece&s;&s;a|ries
to maintain it; he therefore makes a Re&s;oluti|on
never to be vex'd, let what will happen, but
with Patience &s;ubmit to the will of GOD, who has
the Direction of all Things; &s;o, having paid his
u&s;ual Devotion, he goes into the Kitchen, in Or|der
to break Fa&s;t, and then to take his accu&s;tomary
Walk. Whil&s;t he was eating there aro&s;e a Noi&s;e
in the Air, as proceeding from a Quantity of Rooks,
Jackdaws, Crows, and &s;uch like Birds, whole com|mon
Notes he was acquainted with, and as the
Noi&s;e approach'd, he had the Curio&s;ity to go and
&s;ee what was the Matter, but was prevented by the
coming of a large Fowl which flew over his Head,
<PB N="229" REF="244">
as he was going out; he turn'd back to admire the
Bird, who&s;e Beauty &s;eiz'd him with Admiration;
the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing &s;o charming a Creature quite
put out of his Mind the Curio&s;ity of looking from
whence proceeded the di&s;agreeable Noi&s;e without,
which ea&s;ing as &s;oon as the Bird was &s;helter'd, made
him imagine tho&s;e carrion Birds had been a cha&s;ing
that beautiful Fowl, who &s;eeing it &s;elf out of Dan|ger
&s;tood &s;till very calm and compos'd, which gave
him the Opportunity of making a Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of e|very
dividual Agreement as compos'd &s;o delight|ful
an Object, it was the Bigne&s;s and Form of a
Swan, almo&s;t headed like it, only the Bill was not
&s;o long nor &s;o broad, and red like Coral; his Eyes,
like tho&s;e of a Hawk, his Head of a Mazarine
Blew, and on the Top of it a Tuff of &s;hining gold-colour'd
Feathers, which did &s;pread over it, hang|ing
near three Inches beyond all round; its Brea&s;t,
Face, and Part of its Neck Milk-white, couriou&s;ly
&s;peckled with &s;mall black Spots, a Gold-colour'd
Circle about it, its Back and Neck behind of a fine
Crim&s;on &s;peckled with Purple, its Legs and Feet the
&s;ame Colour of its Bill, its Tail long and round,
&s;preading like that of a Peacock, compos'd of &s;ix
Rows of Feathers all of different Colours, which
made a mo&s;t delightful Mixture.</P>
<P>Having &s;pent &s;everal Minutes admiring the Bird,
he lays Pea&s;e and crumbled Roots both roa&s;ted and
boil'd before it, as al&s;o Water in a Shell; &s;o with|drew
to give it Liberty to eat and drink; and &s;tood
out peeping to &s;ee what it would do, who, being a|lone,
having look'd about him, picks a few Pea&s;e
and drinks heartily, then walks towards the Door,
in a compo&s;ing and ea&s;y Manner, much like that
of a Cock.</P>
<P><HI>Quarll,</HI> being at the Out&s;ide, was of twenty Minds
whether he &s;hould detain him or let him go; his
<PB N="230" REF="245">
Affection for that admirable Creature equally prompts
him to both; he cannot bear the Thoughts of part|ing
with &s;o lovely an Object, nor harbour that of
depriving it of its Liberty, which it &s;o implicitly
did intru&s;t him withal. Thus, after a &s;mall Pau&s;e,
Genero&s;ity prevails over &s;elf-Plea&s;ure, why &s;hould I,
&s;aid he, make the Place of its Refuge its Pri&s;on? &s;o
makes Room for him to go, who, with a &s;low Pace,
walks out; and having look'd about him a &s;mall
Time, mounts up a con&s;iderable Height, then takes
its Cour&s;e North-we&s;t.</P>
<P>The Bird being gone out of Sight, he made Re|flections
on the Adventure, which he judges to be a
Progno&s;tick of &s;ome Rebellion or revolution in <HI>Eu|rope;</HI>
&s;o having recommended his native Country
to the Protection of Heavens, begging for a Conti|nuation
of Peace, and an End of tho&s;e unhappy
Divi&s;ions, which often prove the Ruin of Nations;
he goes and &s;ets down in his Memorial-Book the
Tran&s;actions of that Year being 1689, and the I5th
&s;ince his being in the I&s;land, which prov'd more
fruitful in Events than any of the preceeding;
the Picture which he had drawn of the ter|rible
Sea-Mon&s;ter, being again&s;t his Wall he
accu&s;tom'd him&s;elf with the frightful Object that
con&s;tantly di&s;turb'd his Mind, he draws that of the
two Ruffians, committing their Barbarity, and
hangs it by the Place; the Idea whereof being
to him more obnoxious than the preceeding, he
could not &s;uffer it to be long in his Sight &s;o
takes it down, and draws on the Back-&s;ide of it,
the Villains on a Gibbet, now, &s;aid he, this
being what ought to be the End and Explana|tion
of the Hi&s;tory, &s;hall now be the right Side
of the Picture.</P>
<P>There happening nothing the Remainder of the
Year, worthy of Record, he imploys it in his ac|cu&s;tomary
<PB N="231" REF="246">
Occupations, as pruning and watering
his Lodge and Dairy, making his Mats to lie on,
as al&s;o his Winter-Garb, every Day milking his
Antelopes and Goats, making now and then Butter
and Chee&s;e, attending his Nets, and &s;uch like nece&s;|&s;ary
Imployment.</P>
<P>The mean Time, the <HI>French</HI> Mariners, who pro|bably
got Money by what they had taken from him
the Year before, return'd, it being much about the
&s;ame Sea&s;on, and being re&s;olv'd to take him away,
and all they could make any Thiug of, out of the
I&s;land, were provided with Hands and Implements
to accompli&s;h their De&s;ign; as Ropes to bind what
they could get alive, and Guns to &s;hoot what they
could not come at, Saws and Hatchets to cut down
Logwood aud Brazil, Pick-Ax's and Shovels to dig
up Oris-Roots and others of worth, which they
imagin'd the I&s;land did produce; likewi&s;e flat-bot|tom'd
Boats to tow in &s;hallow Water, where others
could not come, and thus by degrees to load their
Ship with Booty; but ever-watchful Providence
bla&s;ted their evil Projects, and confounded their De|vices,
at the very In&s;tant they thought them&s;elves
&s;ure of Succe&s;s: The Implements in a flat-bottom'd
Boat were tow'd to the very Foot of the Rock, by
a young Fellow, who being lighter than a Man, was
thought fitte&s;t to go with the Tools, which pretty
well loaded the Boat.</P>
<P>Their Materials being landed to their great Sa|tisfaction,
the Men on Board embark'd in two more
of the &s;ame &s;ort of Boats, but were no &s;ooner in 'em,
but a Storm aro&s;e, which da&s;h'd their &s;lender Bot|tom
to Pieces, and wa&s;h'd them into the Sea, in
which they peri&s;h'd, al&s;o over-&s;et the flat-bottom'd
Boat on Shore, with the Load and Lad underneath
it.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="247">
The Storm being over, which la&s;ted from about
eight in the Morning, till almo&s;t twelve at Noon,
when <HI>Quarll,</HI> according to his Cu&s;tom, went to &s;ee
if he could perceive any Damage done by the late
Tempe&s;t, and if any di&s;tre&s;s'd by it &s;tood in want
of help.</P>
<P>Being at that &s;ide of the Rock he us'd to vi&s;it, he
could &s;ee nothing but a few Fi&s;hes and Shells the Sea
had left in the Clifts; if this, &s;aid he, be all the
Damage that has been done, make me thankful, it
will recruit me with fre&s;h Fi&s;h and Uten&s;ils; &s;o he
goes on to the N. W. part, where he &s;ees a batter'd
Boat, floating with the Keel upwards, this, &s;aid he,
boades &s;ome Mi&s;chief, but thought it not to be of
any Con&s;equence; having gone about fifty Yards
further, he '&s;pies a &s;mall Barrel at the Foot of the
Rock, with &s;everal Planks and Fragments of a Ship,
floating with the Tide. Alas! &s;aid he, the&s;e are
too evident Proofs of a Shipwreck, to hope other|wi&s;e;
as he was looking about, he hears a Voice
cry out, much like that of a Man, at &s;ome di&s;tance
behind a Part of the Rock; being advanc'd a &s;mall
matter, beyond where he was, Heaven's be prais'd,
&s;aid he, there is &s;ome Body, whom I am luckily
come to &s;ave, and he mo&s;t fortunately come to be
my Companion, I cannot but rejoyce at the Event,
tho' I heartily grieve for the Accident; &s;o ha&s;tens
to the Place where he thought the Cries came from,
which, as he advanc'd he could di&s;cern to be too
&s;hrill for a Man's Voice, certainly, &s;aid he, this mu&s;t
be &s;ome Woman by the Noi&s;e. This &s;ets his Blood
a Glowing, his Heart alters its Motion; Now, &s;aid
he, joyful Providence has compleated my Happine&s;s,
I &s;hall have a Companion and a help Mate, and go's
on with fre&s;h Vigour, as tho' he had recover'd his
Strength, and got new Limbs: The rough and &s;a|vage
Rock, which was before, in a Manner inacce&s;|&s;ible,
<PB N="233" REF="248">
is now made ea&s;y to Walk; he climbs the
high Places with Activity, and goes down the &s;teep
as nimbly, and &s;oon arrives where he judg'd the
Per&s;on to be, yet &s;eeing nothing, but what he took
to be a Che&s;t, begun to be di&s;heartn'd, &s;ure, &s;aid
he, this is not a &s;econd Allu&s;ion, to decoy my
Fancy after what is not to be had! Thus his Joy
of a &s;udden turn'd into a deep Melancholy; but
the Creature underneath, who having heard &s;ome
Noi&s;e near at hand, ceas'd crying, to liften, yet &s;ee|ing
no Body come, cries out again, &s;omething loud|er
than before.</P>
<P>This reviv'd him quite and repeals his Hopes; it
is a Woman, &s;aid he, and in that Che&s;t, &s;o was a
going to break it open, but &s;tops of a Suddain;
What am I going to do? How do I know the Cau&s;e
of her being thus lock'd up, tho' Women are in
a Manner become a Merchandize, yet they never
are pack'd up or che&s;ted? She mu&s;t be in there for
a Puni&s;hment, which in &s;ome Countries is inflicted
on Witches. The Boy, who heard a Voice calls
out in <HI>French,</HI> which <HI>Quarll</HI> not under&s;tanding, he
was afraid to let it out; but at his mentioning <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>
being intelligible to him, made him change his
Opinion, for <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> his &s;ake doth &s;he &s;ay? That
holy Name Witches &s;eldom make U&s;e of; however
in that Name I'll let her out, if &s;he be under Con|demnation,
was I not &s;o? Had &s;he by Heaven been
decreed to die, &s;he would not been here; &s;o with
his Staff he endeavour'd to break that which he took
to be the Lid of the Che&s;t, but prov'd the Bottom;
and as he was &s;triking, the Boy underneath calling
to him to turn it up, did thru&s;t his Hand under the
Side, which he perceiving, tho he under&s;tood him
not, &s;tood &s;till, finding his Mi&s;take, this$, &s;aid he,

Year before, when they came and plunder'd me,
<PB N="234" REF="249">
now, am I &s;afe if I turn it up? Doubtle&s;s they are
come in greater Numbers; &s;o pau&s;es a while, but
the Lad (whom he took to be a Woman) &s;till con|tinuing
his moan, he was mov'd to Compa&s;&s;ion,
and having con&s;ider'd the Boat could not hold any
great Number, he ventures, let what will come on't,
or who will be under; for the poor Woman's &s;ake
I'll relieve them, there cannot be many Men, how|ever,
I'll let but one out at a Time, if he be mi&s;|chievious
I'm able to deal with him; &s;o he puts the
End of his Staff where he had &s;een the hand, and
litfs it up about a Foot from the Ground, out or the
opening immediately creeps out the Boy, who on
his Knees falls a Begging and Weeping, expecting
Death every Moment, as being the merited Puni&s;h|ment
for the evil Purpo&s;e he was come about: <HI>Quarll</HI>
who expected there was a Woman be&s;ides, fearing
the Gap the Youth came out at, would be too un|ea&s;y
for her to come thro', made Motions for the
Boy to help him, iu order to $et the Boat on its
Bottom, which he did: <HI>Quarll</HI> &s;eeing the Imple|ments
in&s;tead of the Woman, was as much vex'd as
di&s;appointed, his Countenance changes, &s;ometimes
looks at the Things, and then at the Boy, who &s;ee|ing
him appear Angry, thought of nothing but
pre&s;ent Death, again falls on his Knees, holding up
his Hands, almo&s;t drown'd in Tears, begging for
Mercy in &s;uch a moving Manner, that <HI>Quarll</HI> could
not forbear &s;hedding &s;ome Tears, and tho' the late
Di&s;appointment of his propos'd Happine&s;s, and the
Sight of the Preparations made for his intended
Ruin, had moved him to Anger again&s;t that mer|cenary
Nation; he helps the young Fellow up by
the Hand, and the Night coming on a Pace, he takes
one of the Hatchets that lay by, and gave another
to the Boy, then falls a knocking the Boat to pieces,
and directed him to do the &s;ame, which accordingly
he did.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="250">
The Boat being demoli&s;h'd, they carried the
Boards up higher on the Rock, as al&s;o the Re&s;t of
the Things, lea&s;t in the Night &s;ome Storm &s;hould
rai&s;e as might wa&s;h them back into the Sea, it being
then too late to bring them away: Having done
they each of them took up what they could carry,
and to went Home. The young <HI>Frenchman</HI> finding
a kinder Treatment then either he de&s;erved or ex|pected
was extraordinary &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and tractable,
which made <HI>Quarll</HI> the more kind and mild; &s;o
in&s;tead of condemning his his evil Attempt, com|mi&s;erated
his Misfortune, and in room of Re&s;ent|ment
&s;hew'd him Kindne&s;s; thus having given him
of what he had to eat, he puts him to Bed in the
Lodge, wherein he did lie, till he had got his Mats
made up, then went to Bed him&s;elf, but could not
&s;leep for thinking of his late Di&s;appointment, which
did intercept tho&s;e Plea&s;ures he &s;o much depended
on, thinking him&s;elf &s;ure of a Female Partner, who
in &s;haring Happine&s;s with him, would have much
added to his Bli&s;s,</P>
<P>Having to&s;s'd and tumbl'd a con&s;iderable Time,
he begins to be heavy &s;pirited, Nature is fatigu'd
and mu&s;t be refre&s;h'd; thus he falls a &s;leep, and as
his Hopes the preceeding Day had indulg'd his
De&s;ires, his Mind his &s;o impre&s;s'd in the Night
with the Idea of the Female Object, that he dreams
he has her by his Side, condoling her for the Dan|gers
&s;he has gone thro', congratulating her lucky
E&s;cape, and greeting her happy Arrival into &s;o
ble&s;&s;ed an Abode.</P>
<P>Thus expre&s;&s;ing his Joy, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the only
Object as could compleat his Happine&s;s, with all the
Softne&s;s and Eloquence the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate Love
can impre&s;s, he reaches out his Arms to embrace the
lovely Phantom his Inclination had breed in his
Imagination; but having grop'd a while, and find|ing
<PB N="236" REF="251">
nothing, he &s;tarts out of his &s;leep at this mo&s;t
&s;hocking Di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>Being awak'd, the late delu&s;ive plea&s;ures call'd to
his Mind the real, which he had formerly enjoy'd
and which he then did hanker after: What is Man,
&s;aid he, without that Part of him&s;elf, out of which
God made him a Mate? <HI>Adam,</HI> who tho' po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing
all the World, was &s;till wanting, till he had a Wo|man
to keep him Company; in this melancholy
Di&s;po&s;ition he again falls a &s;leep, and dreams a-fre&s;h
in which his Imagination gluts his Inclination with
tho&s;e Plea&s;ures, it &s;o much de&s;ir'd; Fruition to him
is but like Liquor to a Man &s;ick of a violent Fever,
which only for a Minute quenches his Heat, but
augments the Di&s;temper; &s;o at la&s;t de&s;troys the
Patient; exce&s;&s;ive Love is but &s;hort-liv'd, what is
violent is not la&s;ting, Time with Plea&s;ure runs fa&s;t
away, but dwells long with Sorrow, Cares weakens
Love, and Indifferences breeds Di&s;content, then Jar|ings
follow which introduces Divi&s;ion; the Mother
of Poverty.</P>
<P>The&s;e di&s;mal Accidents, incumbent to uncon&s;i|derate
Love, coming into the amorous Dreamer's
Mind, who&s;e great Heat being quench'd, took time
to con&s;ider his Condition, and &s;eeing him&s;elf liable
to them, is &s;truck with &s;uch a Fear as blots all Plea|&s;ures
out of his Thoughts, and fills them with
dread of feutur Cares, which he unadvi&s;edly
run him&s;elf into, and all for the Sake of a &s;hort
Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Starting out of his Sleep at the Approach of tho&s;e
&s;ad Troubles, he returns Heaven Thanks that it was
but a Dream, and begs Pardon for having given &s;o
much way to the Concupi&s;cence of Fle&s;h; &s;o gets
up, tho' &s;ooner than ordinary, le&s;t he &s;hould fall

Having walk'd about till he thought it Time for
the Boy to ri&s;e, he calls him up, and takes him to
the Place that he u&s;ually went every Morning and
Evening to &s;ing P&s;alms; where the Youth being
come, and hearing &s;o many different Voices, and
&s;eeing no Body, was &s;car'd out of his Wits, and took
to his Heels, making towards the Rock as fa&s;t as he
could; but as he was not acquainted with the ea&s;i|e&s;t
and mo&s;t practicable Parts thereof, <HI>Quarll</HI> had
made an End of his P&s;alm, and overtook him be|fore
he could get to the Sea-Side, where he certain|ly
would have ca&s;t him&s;elf into with the Fright;
but <HI>Quarll</HI>'s Coming, who, by the Boy's Staring,
gue&s;t his Di&s;order, not having the Benefit of the

<P>The Fit being over, he and the Boy took a|way,
at diver&s;e Times, the Remains of the Che&s;t,
and of what was in it, which they could not car|ry
Home the Day before; &s;o taking up two Guns,
Now, &s;aid he the&s;e unlucky In&s;truments, which
were intended for De&s;truction, &s;hall be employ'd for
the Pre&s;ervation of that they were to de&s;troy; &s;o
takes them to his Lodge, and &s;ets them at each
Side of the Door; then being Dinner-Time, he
&s;trikes a Light, and &s;ets the Boy to make a Fire,
whil&s;t he made &s;ome of the Fish fit to fry, which
he pick'd up upon the Rock the Evening before;
then takes dripping he &s;av'd when he roa&s;ted any
Fle&s;h, to fry them withal. The Boy, who had liv'd
&s;ome Time in <HI>Holland,</HI> where they u&s;e much But|ter,
&s;eeing Dripping employ'd in Room thereof,
thought to plea&s;e his Ma&s;ter in making &s;ome; and

<P><HI>Quarll</HI> &s;eing the Youth indu&s;trious, begins to fan|cy
him, notwith&s;tanding the Aver&s;ion he had con|ceiv'd

he had receiv'd from his Country Men; and as
Speech is one of the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Faculties to

<P>The Lad, being acute and ingenious, was &s;oon
made to under&s;tand it, and in &s;ix Months capable
to &s;peak it &s;ufficiently, &s;o as to give his Ma&s;ter a
Relation of his late coming, and to what Intent.
The Men, &s;aid he, who about one Year &s;ince carried
away from hence &s;ome Antelopes, with extraordi|nary
Ducks, and &s;everal Rarities, which they &s;aid
did belong to a mon&s;truous. <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hermit, who&s;e

hir'd a Ship to fetch away the Hermit, and
what el&s;e they could find, therefore brought with
them Tools, and Guns to &s;hoot what they could not
take alive. Barbarous Wretches, reply'd he, to
kill my dear Antelopes and Ducks! pray what did
they intend to do with me? Why, &s;aid the Boy,
to make a Show of you. To make a Show of me!
&s;ordid Wretches, is a Chri&s;tian then &s;uch a Rarity
among&s;t them? Well, and what were the Saws and
Hatchets for? To cut down your Hou&s;e, which
they intended to make a drinking Booth of. Ho,
mon&s;truous! what Time and Nature have been fif|teen
Years in compleating, they would have ruin'd
in a Moment; well, Thanks to Providence, their e|vil
De&s;ign is averted. Pray, what is become of tho&s;e

and I aveng'd; but how came thou to e&s;cape, for
thou wa&s;t with them? No, reply'd the Youth, I
was upon the Rock when their Boat was da&s;h'd a|gain&s;t
it, and was over-&s;et with the &s;ame Sea, under
the flat bottom'd Boat, where you found me. That
was a happy Over&s;et for thee; well, is there no Gra|titude
due to Providence for thy E&s;cape? due to
Providence, &s;aid he, why, I thought you had &s;av'd
me? I'm &s;ure you let me out. Yes, reply'd <HI>Quarll,</HI>
but I was &s;ent by Providence for that Purpo&s;e.
That was kindly done to &s;aid the Boy, well, when,
I &s;ee him I will thank him; doth he live here a|bout?
Poor ignorant Creature, replied <HI>Quarll,</HI> why,
Providence is every where; what! did&s;t thou ne|ver
hear of Providence, what Religion art thou?
Religion, an&s;wer'd the Youth, I don't know what
you mean, I am a Fi&s;herman by Trade, which my
Father did live by. Well, &s;aid <HI>Quarll,</HI> did he teach
thee nothing el&s;e, no Prayers? Prayers, reply'd the
Lad, why, Fi&s;hermen have no Time to pray, that's
for them who have nothing el&s;e to do, poor Folk
mu&s;t work and get Money, that's the Way of our
Town, Covetous Wretches! Well, &s;aid he, I
grudge them not of what they po&s;&s;e&s;s, &s;ince its all
the Happine&s;s they a&s;pire at; but thou &s;halt Iearn
to pray, which will be of far more Advantage to
thee than Work, both here and hereafter; &s;o from
that Time begins to teach him the Lord's Prayer
and the ten Commandments, as al&s;o the Principles
of the Chri&s;tian Religion: All which In&s;tructions
the Youth taking readily, won his Affection the
more; and likewi&s;e taught him to &s;ing P&s;alms,

<P>During his Sleep his Fancy is delighted with be|ing

<P>The Place appear'd very &s;pacious, and of an ad|mirable

<P>The lofty Trees, which &s;tood on a level Ground,
cover'd with curious Gra&s;s, embaml'd with many
different colour'd Flowers, exceeding in Beauty any
Carpet that the mo&s;t expert Arti&s;t could make, did
&s;pread their branchy Arms over Creatures of all

There the bold Lyon lies by the innocent Lamb,
the fierce Panther wear the harmle&s;s Sheep, the ra|venous
Woolf with the mild Goat, Leopard and
Deer, Tyger and Hare repos'd together in Peace; on

delightful Flowers, both for Sight and Smell:
At the End of it there was an Arbour of the &s;ame,

Tape&s;tery, the mo&s;t expert Arti&s;t had exerted him|&s;elf

Greatne&s;s of his Skill: In it there &s;at three Ladies

Hand an Olive-Branch bearing Fruit, which, when
gathered, was immediately &s;ucceeded with Blo&s;&s;om;
&s;o that it never was without the one or the other.
The Lady who fat on the left Side was more jolly
and gay, yet look'd &s;omewhat careful; &s;he had in
her Hand a long Ve&s;&s;el, broad at one End, and &s;harp
at the other like a Horn, bending towards the Point,
full of all Sorts of Fruits.</P>

their Conver&s;ation; they perceiving his Mo|de&s;ty

and went another Way, to give him the Opportu|nity

where he &s;aw a &s;tately Cock, of an extraordinary
Size, &s;trutting from Animal to Animal, taking from
mo&s;t of them &s;omething, whil&s;t they were a&s;leep,

carefully made &s;ufficient Provi&s;ion to maintain what
he had done, &s;o bid them all Defiance.</P>
<P>There happening a great Noi&s;e of Squeeling,
wak'd him out of his Dream, and his Mind being
impre&s;s'd with Notions of War, which at fir&s;t &s;eiz'd
him with Terror, but being &s;omething Settled, and
the Noi&s;e &s;till continuing, he perceiv'd it did pro|ceed
from the two different Kinds of Monkeys in
the I&s;land, who were fighting for the wild Pomgra|nates
which the high Wind had &s;hook off the Trees
the preceeding Night, which prov'd very boi&s;trous.</P>
<P>Having gue&s;s'd the Occa&s;ion of their Debate, he
gets up, in Order to go and quell their Difference,

getting up, he opens the Door, at the Out-&s;ide of
which an old Monkey of each &s;ort, were quietly
waiting his Levy, to intice him to come, as he once
did before, and put an End to their bloody War.</P>
<P>He was not a little &s;urpriz'd to &s;ee two &s;uch in|veterate

<P>That mo&s;t &s;urprizing Sign of Rea&s;on in tho&s;e

him upon the&s;e Reflections; would Princes, &s;aid he,
be but rea&s;onable, as tho&s;e who by Nature are ir|rational,
how much Blood and Money would be
&s;aved? Having admired the Unea&s;ine&s;s of tho&s;e
poor Creatures, who &s;till did go a few Steps for|ward
<PB N="246" REF="261">
and then backward to him; he was in Hopes
to decay one or both into his Lodge, by throwing
Meat to them; but tho&s;e Example-giving-Animals,
hearing their Fellows in Trouble, had no regard to
their &s;eperate Intere&s;t, &s;o took no Notice of what he
gave them, but kept moving to and again with all
the Tokens of $$$ea&s;ine&s;s they could Expre&s;s;
which &s;o mov'd him, that he ha&s;ten'd to the Place,
where his Pre&s;ence caus'd immediately a Ce&s;&s;ation
of Arms, and each Party mov'd a con&s;iderable
$word$ of$ each other, waiting his &s;haring the
Wind-al$; which being done, they quietly took
that $$eap as lay next each Kind, &s;o went to their
$span$ Q$$$ters.</P>
<P>This Accident, which in &s;ome manner made out
his Dream of Wars, brought it al&s;o fre&s;h into his
Mind, which being full of Cares about his Country,
whom he much $ear'd, if any &s;hould happen in <HI>Eu|rope,</HI>
would be involv'd therein; and calling to Re|membrance

1690.</P>
<P>Fourteen Years more being pa&s;t, every Thing
keeping its natural Cour&s;e, there happening no|thing
extrordinary, each &s;ucceeding Year renoving
the Plea&s;ures the Preceeding did produce: Thunders
and high Winds being frequent, tho' not equally
violent, he thought it not material to Record them,
or their Effects, as blowing and throwing Fi&s;hes,
Shells, empty Ve&s;&s;els, batter'd Che&s;ts, &amp;c. upon
the Rock, only Tran&s;actions and Events wonderful
and uncommon, and there happening a mo&s;t &s;ur|prizing
<PB N="247" REF="262">
one a few Days after, which tho' of no great
Moment, is as worthy of Record as any of far
greater Concern, being a wonderful Effect of Pro|vidence,
manife&s;ted in a miraculous Manner, tho'
not to be &s;aid Supernatural.</P>
<P>One Morning, when he had roa&s;ted a Parcel of
tho&s;e Roots, which he us'd to eat in&s;tead of Bread,
and this he commonly did once a Week, eating be&s;t
when Stale, having &s;pread them on his Table and
Che&s;t to cool, he went out to walk, leaving his
Door open to let the Air in.</P>
<P>His Walk, tho' grac'd with all the Agreements
Nature could adorn it withal to make it delightful,
a Gra&s;s Carpet, imbroider'd with beautiful Flowers
of many different Colours and Smell under his Feet
to tread on; before and on each &s;ide of him, was
fine lofty Trees of various Forms and Height,
cloath'd with plea&s;ant green Leaves trim'd with rich
Blo&s;&s;oms of many Colours to divert his Eye; a
Number of &s;everal &s;orts of melodious Singing-Birds
pearching in their mo&s;t lovely Shades, as tho' Na|ture
had &s;tudied to excell Man's brighte&s;t Imagina|tion
and Exqui&s;itene&s;s of Art; yet all the&s;e Profu&s;e|ne&s;&s;es
of Nature's Wonder, are not &s;ufficient to keep
away or expell anxious Thoughts from his Mind;
it runs upon his two dear Antelopes, the darling
Heads of his pre&s;ent Stock, whom he took &s;uch
care to bring up, and were become &s;o engaging al|ways
attending him in tho&s;e fine Walks, adding by
their &s;wift Races, active Leapings, and other un|common
Diver&s;ions to the natural Plea&s;antne&s;s of
the Place, which now, by their mo&s;t lamented Ab|&s;ence,
is become a dull <HI>Memorandum</HI> of the barba|rous
Manner they were ravi&s;h'd away from him.</P>
<P>In the&s;e melancholy Thoughts, which his Lone|&s;omne&s;s
every now and then did create, he returns
Home, where Providence had provided a Remedy
<PB N="248" REF="263">
for his Grievance; a Companion far exceeding any
he ever he had, waits his return, which was a beau|tiful
Monkey of the fine&s;t Kind, and the mo&s;t com|pleat
of the Sort, as tho' made to manife&s;t the un|parallel'd
Skill of Nature, is &s;ent him by Providence
to di&s;&s;ipate his Melancholy.</P>
<P>Being come to his Lodge, and beholding that
wonderful Creature, and in his own Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, being
at the furthe&s;t End of it, and he at the Enterance
thereof, to oppo&s;e its flight, if offer'd, he is at once
fill'd with Joy and Admiration; long, &s;aid he, I
endeavour'd in vain to get one, and would have
been glad of any, tho' of the wor&s;t Kind, and even
the meane&s;t of the Sort, and here kind Providence
has &s;ent me one of an unparellel'd Beauty.</P>
<P>Having a con&s;iderable Time admir'd the Bea&s;t,
who all the while &s;tood unconcern'd, now and then
eating of the Roots that lay before him, he &s;huts
the Door and goes in, with a Re&s;olution of &s;taying
within all Day, in order to tame him, which he hop'd
would be no difficult Matter, his Di&s;po&s;ition be|ing
already pretty familiar, little thinking, that
Providence, who &s;ent him there, had already qual|lify'd
him for the Commi&s;&s;ion he bore; which hav|ving
found out by the Creatur's &s;urprizing Docility,
he returns his Benefactor his mo&s;t hearty Thanks
for that miraculous Gift.</P>
<P>This mo&s;t wonderful Animal, having by its &s;ur|prizing
Tractability and good Nature join'd, to its
matchle&s;s Hand&s;omne&s;s, gain'd its Ma&s;ter's Love,
beyond what is u&s;ual to place on any &s;ort of Bea&s;ts,
he thought him&s;elf double recompenc'd for all his
former Lo&s;&s;es, e&s;pecially for that of his late ungrat|ful
Companion, who notwith&s;tanding all the Obli|gations
he held from him, ba&s;ely left him, at a
Time he might be mo&s;t helpful; and as he fancied
his dear <HI>Beaufidelle</HI> (for &s;o be call'd that admirable
<PB N="249" REF="264">
Creature) had &s;ome &s;ort of Re&s;emblance to the Pict|ture
he dream'd of him, he takes it down, thinking
it unju&s;t to bear in his Sight, that vile Object could
not any wi&s;e claim a Likene&s;s to &s;o worthy a Crea|ture
as his beloved Monkey.</P>
<P>One Day as this lovely Animal was officiating
the Charge, it had of its own accord taken, being
gone for Wood, as wont to do when wanted, he
finds in his Way a wild Pomgranate, who&s;e extra|traordinary
&s;ize and weight had caus'd to fall off
the Tree, he takes it Home, and then returns for
his Faggot, in which time <HI>Quarll,</HI> wi&s;hing the
Goodne&s;s of the In&s;ide might an&s;wer its outward
Beauty, cuts it open, and finding it of a dull Lucti|tiou&s;ne&s;s
too flat for eating, imagin'd it might be
u&s;ed with things, of an A&s;&s;$$ and Sharp ta&s;te; &s;o
having boild &s;ome Water he puts it into a Ve&s;&s;el
with a &s;ort of an Herb, which is of the Ta&s;te and
Nature of Crea&s;&s;es, and &s;ome of the Pomgranate, &s;o
lets them infu&s;e &s;ome time, now and then &s;tirring
it, which the Monkey having taken Notice off did
the &s;ame, but one very hot Day happening to lay
the Ve&s;&s;el in the Sun, which made it turn &s;ower.</P>
<P><HI>Quarll,</HI> who very much wanted Vinegar in his
Sauces, was well pleas'd with the Accident, and &s;o
continu'd the &s;ouring on't, which proving excellent,
he made a five Gallon Ve&s;&s;el of it, having &s;everal,
which at times he found upon the Rock.</P>
<P>Having now &s;tore of Vinegar, and being a great
Lover of Pickles, which he had learnt to make by
&s;eeing his la&s;t Wife, who being an extraordinary
Cook, and made of all &s;orts every Year; he calls
to Mind he had often in his Walks &s;een &s;omething
like Mu&s;hrooms, &s;o makes it his Bu&s;ine&s;s to look
for &s;ome; thus having pick'd up a few, of which
<HI>Beaufidelle</HI> (who follow'd him up and down) having
taken Notice, immediately ranges about, and being
<PB N="250" REF="265">
nimbler footed than his Ma&s;ter, and not oblig'd to
&s;toop &s;o low, pick'd double the Quantity in the
&s;ame Space of Time; &s;o that he &s;oon had enough
to &s;erve him till the next Sea&s;on.</P>
<P>His good Succe&s;s in making that &s;ort of Pickle,
encourages him to try another; and having taken
notice of a Plant in the Wood, that bears a &s;mall
green Flower, which before it is blown looks like
a Caper, he gathers a few, and their Ta&s;te and Fla|vour
being no ways di&s;agreeable, he judg'd, that
when pickl'd, they would be plea&s;ant, &s;o tries them,
which according to his Mind were full as good as
the real Ones: He gathers a &s;ufficient Quantity,
with the Help of his Attendant, &s;o &s;tocks him&s;elf
with two as plea&s;ant Pickles, as different &s;orts; but
there's another which he admires above all, none to
his Mind like the Cucumber, and the I&s;land pro|ducing
none, left him no$ $$oom to hope for any;
yet (as Likene&s;s is a va&s;t help to Imagination) if he
could but find any thing, which ever &s;o little re&s;em|bles
them in Make, Nature or Ta&s;te, it will plea&s;e
his Fancy: He therefore examaines every kind of
Buds, Blo&s;&s;oms, and Seeds, having at la&s;t found
that of a wild Par&s;nip, which being long and nar|row,
almo&s;t the Bigne&s;s and Make of a Pickling
Cucumber, green and cri&s;p withal, full of a &s;mall
flat Seed, not unlike that of the Thing he would
$ain have it to be, he pickles &s;ome of them, which
being of Colour and near upon the Make, he fancies
them quite of the Ta&s;te.</P>
<P>His Beans being at that Time large enough for
the fir&s;t Crop, he gathers &s;ome for his Dinner, the
Shells being tender and of a delicate green, it came
into his Mind, they might be made to imitate
<HI>French</HI> Beans; they are, &s;aid he, near the Nature,
I can make them quite of the Shape, &s;o be they
have the &s;ame Savour; &s;o he cuts them in long nar|row
<PB N="251" REF="266">
Slips, and pickles &s;ome, the other Part he boils,
and there being none to contradict their ta&s;te, they
pa&s;t current, for as good <HI>French</HI> Beans as any that
ever grew.</P>
<P>The Di&s;appointment of having &s;omething more
comfortable than Water to drink, being retriev'd
by producing in the Room thereof, withal to make
his Eatables more delicious, he proceeds in his fir&s;t
Project, and taking nece&s;&s;ary Cares to prevent that
Accident which intercepted Succe&s;s in his fir&s;t un|dertaking,
$he accompli&s;hes his De&s;ign, and makes
a Liquor no wi&s;e inferior to the be&s;t Cider; &s;o,
that now he has both to revive and keep up his Spi|rits,
as well as to plea&s;e his Palate and &s;ute his
Appe$ite.</P>
<P>Having now nothing to crave or wi&s;h for, but
rather all Motives for Content, he lies down with a
peaceable Mind, no Care or Fear di&s;turbing his
Thoughts, his Sleep is not interrupted with fright|ful
Fancies, but rather diverted with plea&s;ant and
diverting Dreams, he is not &s;tartled at Thunder or
Storms, tho' never &s;o terrible, his Tru&s;t being on
Providence, who at &s;undry Times, and in various
manners has re&s;cu'd him from Death, tho' appa|rently
unavoidable, being for above thirty Years mi|raculou&s;ly
protected and maintain'd in a Place &s;o
remote $$om all human Help and A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Yet, notwith&s;tanding his Firmne&s;s and whole
Tru&s;t on Providence, he is oblig'd to give way to
the Weakne&s;s of his Nature; a &s;trange and &s;hocking
Noi&s;e is heard at a Di&s;tance in the Air, which hav|ing
reach'd the Place where he &s;tood, covers it
with Darkne&s;s for &s;everal Minutes, at which he is
&s;o alarm'd, that he thinks him&s;elf pa&s;t all Hopes,
till the Noi&s;e being ceas'd, and that which intercep|ted
the Light di&s;pers'd, his &s;car'd Sen&s;es returning
to their proper Seat, and his &s;tray'd Rea&s;on repeal'd,
<PB N="252" REF="267">
he is a&s;ham'd of the Weakne&s;s of his Faith, and
begs Pardon for his late Mi&s;tru&s;t of the Continua|tion
of Providence's Protection, who had all along
given him all imaginable rea&s;on to depend on it at
all Times; thus having open'd his Door, he &s;teps
out to &s;ee if he could di&s;cover the Cau&s;e of the late
mo&s;t &s;urprizing and &s;udden Darkne&s;s, in a bright
Sun-&s;hining Day, which having found out by the
va&s;t Number of dead Birds of &s;everal Kinds, laying
up and down the Ground, he was &s;eiz'd with no
&s;mall Amazement, tho' with le&s;s Fear.</P>
<P>From that mo&s;t &s;urprizing A&s;pect, he infers there
had been a Battle of tho&s;e Creatures in the Air, the
great Number of which had occa&s;ion'd the late de|crea&s;e.</P>
<P>Having made Reflections upon that a&s;toni&s;hing
Tran&s;action, he can draw from thence no other
Inference, but a Progno&s;tication of dreadful Wars
in <HI>Europe,</HI> from which he begs Heavens to protect
his native Country: And lea&s;t the dead Birds that
lay in great Numbers &s;hould (with laying) infect
the I&s;land, he and his Monkey carried them to the
other Side of the Rock, &s;o threw them into the Sea,
only as many of them as had &s;oft Feathers on their
Brea&s;ts and Bellies he pluck'd away to &s;tuff a Pil|low
for the Bea&s;t, being a little too hot at Nights
for it to lie upon the Bed; &s;o having clear'd the
Place, and being tir'd with often going up and
down the rugged Rock, he &s;tay'd at Home the Re|mainder
of the Day, and at Night goes to Bed;
but as the late Omen of approaching Evil had pre|occupated
his Thoughts in the Day, with Cares
concerning his Country, his Mind run upon't in the
Night; &s;o dreams he &s;ees Wives weeping and melt|ing
in Tears, taking their Leaves of their indulging
Husbands, hanging de&s;titute of Strength about their
Necks, who&s;e Grief did weigh them to the Ground:
<PB N="253" REF="268">
Turning from that afflicting Object, he &s;ees another
as &s;hocking; the old Father bath'd in Tears em|bracing
his only Son, bidding him farewel, and
with him to all the Comforts of this Life, and &s;up|port
of his Age; moving his Eyes from that, they
light on full as$ bad a Sight, the tender Mother
&s;woning in her dear Child's Arms, whom an inex|orable
Pre&s;s-Gang &iuml;s hawling away. Thus every
Face expre&s;&s;ing Grief for a Relation or a Friend;
not being able to &s;ee tho&s;e terrifying Objects (which
the Town did abound in) he betakes him&s;elf to the
Country, that by keeping from the Afflicted, he
may avoid Grief.</P>
<P>Having quit the Town, he finds him&s;elf on a
&s;udden, in a Place as full of Terrors, where he &s;aw
Gores of Blood here and there, lo&s;e Hor&s;es kicking
and prancing about, &s;ome draging their late Rider
by the Stirrop, others wounded and their Guts
hanging out, at a Di&s;tance crouds of Men in Flame
and Smoak, confu&s;edly moving like Heaps of Du&s;t
in a Whirl-wind, leaving behind them as they
mov'd va&s;t Numbers of Men and Hor&s;es, both dead
and dying; &s;ome without Legs, others without
Arms, and abundance with but one of each.</P>
<P>At a Di&s;tance from thence, &s;ome in pur&s;uit of
their Enemies, hacking and cutting them down all
the Way before them, like Wood for Fewel, others
flying from being Slain, ca&s;t them&s;elves into rapid
Rivers, where they peri&s;h by thou&s;ands.</P>
<P>As he was looking at tho&s;e terrible Objects, he
finds him&s;elf of a &s;udden &s;urrounded by ru&s;tical
Soldiers, holding their Swords and Bayonets to his
Brea&s;t, asking him in a &s;urly Manner, whether
<HI>High</HI> or <HI>Low;</HI> at which being very much &s;tartled,
not knowing what to An&s;wer, being a Stranger to
their meaning, he told them he was an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI>
which they appearing to be al&s;o, made him hope
<PB N="254" REF="269">
for better U&s;age; but they &s;eizing him in a violent
Manner, &s;aying he might he <HI>Engligh,</HI> and yet an
Enemy to the Country, then he awak'd in a won|derful
Fright; but being come to him&s;elf he con|cludes,
that his Dream did proceed from his late
Surprize, at the preceeding Day's a&s;toni&s;hing Tran&s;|actions;
&s;o having again recommended his Country
to Heavens Protection, he goes about making the
Bed for his Monkey, as he had concluded on be|fore,
and with &s;ome Sail-Cloth makes a Ca&s;e, &s;o
&s;tuffed it with the Feathers he had &s;aved for that
Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The Night being come, he lays the Couching
which he made for the Bea&s;t, by his own Bed, who
very readily went to it, being very &s;oft and ea&s;y.</P>
<P>And as Cares for his Country had in the Day
occupay'd his Thoughts, his Mind in the Night is
impre&s;s'd with the Subject, tho' not with &s;o di&s;mal
an Idea as the Preceeding, having &s;ince been divert|ed
with &s;uch Objects as remov'd the terrifying A&s;|pects,
as before offer'd them&s;elves to his Imagination,
which now is taken up with being in St. <HI>James</HI>'s-Park,
where he had formerly taken Plea&s;ure, and
which he fancies had &s;ince lo&s;t many of its former
Agreements.</P>
<P>As he was walking, a Report was rais'd, that a
certain great Per&s;on (who by his late great Services
to the Nation, lhaed gain'd a Title to the Palace) was
ju&s;t deceas'd, having before his Death intail'd the
&s;ame upon a Foreign Prince of great Renown; this
&s;urprizing Piece of News occaxion'd a &s;udden Alter|ation
in every Body's Countenance, &s;ome look'd
pale with Grief, others red with Wrath, but every
Thing in Nature &s;eem'd to expre&s;s a Feeling for
the Lo&s;s, the Trees &s;hed half their Virtues, and the
Gra&s;s wither'd.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="270">
This dull Scene having la&s;ted &s;ome &s;mall Time,
the Trees and Gra&s;s recover their former Verdure
brighter than before; the lofty Oaks, which he
fancied bordered the Mall, bore fine Ro&s;es in va&s;t
Number.</P>
<P>This additional Beauty in tho&s;e noble Plants
&s;o already fam'd Abroad for their Toughne&s;s and
Strength, prompts People of all Nations, to come
and refre&s;h them&s;elves under their lofty and fra|grant
Shades.</P>
<P>Having with great Satisfaction admired the &s;ur|prizing
improvment of the Oaks, which to his
Imagination did progno&s;ticate Pro&s;perity to the
Nation; then he walks on Northwards where &s;ee|ing
abundance of Thi&s;tles, which made him wonder
they were permitted to grow in a Place where
every thing ought to contribute to its Agreements
and Plea&s;antne&s;s; but having con&s;idered the Stout|ne&s;s
of the Plant, which denoted their being well
rooted, the judg'd it impo&s;&s;ible to clear the Ground,
Be&s;ides, the Bees loving to &s;ettle on them, probably
&s;ucking more Honey from their Blo&s;&s;oms, than
any more agreeable or &s;weeter &s;cented Flower, for
that Rea&s;on he imagin'd might be the Occa&s;ion
they were not gather'd.</P>
<P>Walking back again, he meets with &s;everal No|blemen,
&s;ome with a blew Cordoon, others with
green; each with a Gardening Tool in their Hand,
going to turn up and till the Ground, between that
where the Thi&s;tles did grow, and that where the
Oaks &s;tood. He was &s;tartled to &s;ee tho&s;e great
Per&s;ons, who hardly will concern them&s;elves with
their own Lands and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, labour to improve
that wherein every private Per&s;on had a Share; he
&s;tood &s;ome Time admiring their Dexterity, and
Readine&s;s at their Work; then walks on to the
Mall, which he found throng'd with a Quantity $word$
<PB N="256" REF="271">
all Nations, every one having a Ro&s;e in their
Hand, wherewith they diverted them&s;elves as they
walked.</P>
<P>Having gaz'd about him a con&s;iderable Time, he
had a Fancy to go and &s;ee how the noble Gard|ners
went on with their Work; where being come,
he finds, to his great Admiration, the Ground had
been &s;o wonderfully well manur'd, that the Oaks
and Thi&s;tles had &s;truck their Roots through it, and
did meet; &s;o growing together, had produc'd a
Plant which bore both Ro&s;es and Thi&s;tles, to every
Body's Wonder, which ever &s;ince made the Thi&s;tles
&s;o valu'd, that but few great or fine Gardens, that
have not more or le&s;s of them.</P>
<P>His Monkey being &s;tartled out of his Sleep, in a
mighty Fright, running behind his Back &s;quecking,
awak'd him in the Mid&s;t of his Amazement; thus
being exceedingly pleas'd with his late Dream, of
which he conceiv'd a mighty good Omen to Old-<HI>England,</HI>
differing &s;o very much from the preceed|ings,
both in Nature and Signification.</P>
<P>Thus, tho' earlier than he u&s;ually did ri&s;e, he gets
up to &s;et it down, whil&s;t fre&s;h in his Mind, and
al&s;o the Year, being 1707; then goes to take a
Walk before Breakfa&s;t, and the Bea&s;t with him,
who, being not yet recovered of its late Fright, keeps
clo&s;s to his Ma&s;ter, every now and then looking be|hind,
as tho' &s;till fearing, at which <HI>Quarll</HI> concludes
the Creature mu&s;t needs have been di&s;turbed in its
Sleep the Night before, with &s;ome frightful Dream,
which made him wonder that an Animal void of
Rea&s;on, and uncapable of Reflections, &s;hould be
&s;u&s;ceptible to Imagination.</P>
<P>The Day being pa&s;t without any Thing extraor|dinary
happening, he made no further Remarks, but
follow'd his u&s;ual Occupati $n, and then went to
his Re&s;t, and the Monkey to his new Bed, as the
<PB N="257" REF="272">
Night before; which he took Care to draw as clo&s;s
to its Ma&s;ter as he could; then having been twice
or thrice about the Room, examining every Cor|ner,
he lies down and &s;leeps quietly, till the Dawn|ing
of the Morning, at which Time he &s;tarts up
again as the Night before.</P>
<P><HI>Quarll</HI> being &s;econd Time awaked in the fame
Manner, and much about the &s;ame Hour, concludes
the Cau&s;e mu&s;t proceed from the Pillow, and re|&s;olves
to experiment it him&s;elf the next Night, at
which Time Crowds of terrifying A&s;pects appears in
his Imagination, which allure his whole Faculties
and &s;et all his Sen&s;es in an Uproar; his Eyes are
took up with frightful Objects, and his Ears fill'd
with a terrible Noi&s;e, at which the re&s;t of his
Sen&s;es have left their Offices, and are become
u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>Being awake the next Morning, he finds him&s;elf
inlcine to believe that the Pillow had really &s;ome In|fluence
on the Imagination; but as one Night's Ex|perience
was not a &s;ufficient Solution to his Enquiry
in that &s;upernatural Operation, having often dream'd
before he us'd the Pillow, and re&s;olves to try it &s;e|veral
Nights &s;ucce&s;&s;ively; during which his Mon|key
&s;lept very quiet, and he as di&s;turb'd: This
works a great Way towards the Per&s;wa&s;ion of what
he had a &s;trong Fancy to believe; yet to be better
&s;atisfied of the Reality of it, he lays by the Pillow
for three or four Nights together, during which
Time both he and the Bea&s;t did &s;leep very quiet.</P>
<P>This added much to his Opinion, that evil
Effluvies i&s;&s;ued out of tho&s;e Feathers the Pillow
was &s;tuffed with; but as he formerly dream'd and
had many Nights Intermi&s;&s;ion between tho&s;e that
were entertain'd with Dreams, he will once more
try before he fully concludes that it is &s;o: Thus
puts it again under his Head that Night, and as it
<PB N="258" REF="273">
was the la&s;t Experiment, it prov'd al&s;o the mo&s;t
trouble&s;ome, being at the Time terrified with more
&s;hocking Objects than that preceedings, which tho' they
repre&s;ented fierce and bloody Battles to his Imagi|nation,
yet were le&s;s terrible to him, having not
as yet di&s;cern'd his native Country engag'd therein,
whom now he finds to be the principal Party con|cern'd,
on whom all Succe&s;s depends, and which
cannot be &s;trove for, without va&s;t Expences, and ir|retrievable
Lo&s;s of his dear Countrymen, for which
his Heart did bleed, as flu&s;h as for tho&s;e whom he
dream'd he did &s;ee in their Gore.</P>
<P>Having with Terror and Greif fatigu'd his Eyes
with the mo&s;t &s;hocking and afflicting Effects of
War, Men and Hor&s;es lying as thick upon the
Ground as Gra&s;s in a Meadow, and Streams of
Blood running like &s;o many Brooks, &s;upplied by a
&s;trong Spring; he lifts up his Eye to Heaven im|ploring
an End to that execrable Devourer of Man|kind.</P>
<P>And whil&s;t his Eyes were &s;till fix'd to the Hea|vens,
he &s;ees Victory ru&s;hing thro' thick Clouds of
Ob&s;tacles approaching to her, which having over|come,
did &s;ettle over the Army his Countrymen
belong'd to, over who&s;e Head &s;he and flou|ri&s;h'd
her Colours, pointing at approaching Peace,
attended with Plenty; but in a &s;udden there aro&s;e
an infectious Mi&s;t out of the Ground, which cramp|ing
the <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI>'s Hands, that they could no
more u&s;e their conquering Arms; which fatal Ac|cident
having both encourag'd and &s;trengthen'd the
Enemy, they fell on the unfortunate Remains of
the Army, with unmerciful Fury; who now hav|ing
lo&s;t all their Support and Dependance, were
mo&s;t cruelly cut to Pieces; at which mo&s;t di&s;mal
and afflicting Object he did awake; and tho' this
Dream was a &s;ufficient Proof of the Feathers Influ|ence,
<PB N="259" REF="274">
yet he cannot be &s;atisfy'd but it mu&s;t be omi|nous,
having &s;o much Relation to the preceedings;
&s;o &s;ets it down with them, and for a more certain
Conviction of what he had all Cau&s;e imaginable to
believe; he is re&s;olv'd to try his Monkey once
more the Night following; but the Bea&s;t, who had
not yet forgot the Unea&s;ine&s;s that that Bed had
cau&s;ed him, cho&s;e to lie on the Ground, which en|tirely
convinced <HI>Quarll</HI> that there was a malignant
Quality into tho&s;e Feathers; &s;o throws them into
the Sea, and fills the Ca&s;e with a Sort of &s;oft Mo&s;s,
which grew at the Bottom of a particular Tree,
on which the Creature lay very quiet ever after.</P>
<P>And as his yearly &s;tripping the Eagles of their
Eggs, had prevented their Encrea&s;e, it al&s;o favour'd
and advanc'd that of the Creatures in the I&s;land,
on who&s;e Young they did feed; &s;o that the Num|ber
of the wild Monkeys being con&s;iderably aug|mented,
made their Food &s;cant, which caus'd
them now and then to come and &s;teal &s;ome|what
out of <HI>Quarll</HI>'s Ground. <HI>Beanfidelle,</HI> who&s;e
good keeping and warm lying had made to thrive
in Bigne&s;s and Strength exceeding his Kind, finding
&s;ome of them &s;tealing his Ma&s;ter's Roots, did beat
them away, which oblig'd tho&s;e &s;ubtile Creatures
to come &s;everal together, the better to be able
to encounter him, which <HI>Quarll</HI> having taken No|tice
of, and being willing to add a new Sport to his
u&s;ual Diver&s;ions, cuts a Stick of the Length
and Bigne&s;s that the Creature could manage, which
he gave him, and taking his own Staff exerci&s;es it
before him, who did the &s;ame with his; and ap|prehending
what U&s;e it was given him for, he had
it often in his Hands, and with it drove away
the others when they came, tho' ten or a Do|zen
together; &s;o that the Roots were very
well guarded, by his continual Watching, which
<PB N="260" REF="275">
made tho&s;e &s;ly and &s;pightful Creatures watch an
Opportunity to take him at a Di&s;advantage: Thus
finding him one Morning as he was going for Wa|ter
by him&s;elf, as he was wont to do; and being
then without his Staff, of which they &s;tood in great
Fear, a con&s;iderable Number fell upon him, and
did &s;o bite and beat him, that he lay as dead;
but his Ma&s;ter appearing, who being unea&s;y at
his extraordinary Stay, was gone to &s;ee what was
the Occa&s;ion thereof, did put them to the Flight;
and &s;o le&s;s the poor Creature with ju&s;t Breath e|nough
to keep the Life of it in, and &s;carce Strength
&s;ufficient to draw it.</P>
<P><HI>Quarll</HI> being come to the Place where his beloved
<HI>Beaufidelle</HI> lay in a mo&s;t di&s;mal bloody Condition,
he could not forbear &s;hedding Tears to &s;ee him
thus mi&s;erably dying; but finding &s;till Breath in
him, gave him Hopes of his Recovery: And
takin him up in his Arms, with all the Care he
could, he ha&s;tens Home, and gives him a little of
the Liquor he had made, which by that Time, had
got both Body and Spirit; then having laid him
upon its Bed, and cover'd him with his Winter-Wrapper,
he makes a Fire and warms &s;ome of the
&s;aid Liquor, and fre&s;h Butter, wherewith he wa&s;hes
its Sores; &s;o lays him down again, giving him all
the careful Attendance he could during its Illne&s;s,
which held but one Week, at the End of which if
died, to his un&s;peakable Grief, who from that
Time did grow &s;o melancholly, that he had not
the Courage to go on with his Memorial, till
having a mo&s;t remarkable Dream about twelve
Months after, he chang'd his Re&s;olution, &s;o pro|ceeded
in his Memoirs; and as he did &s;et down
his Dream, he al&s;o did the Death of his beloved
Bea&s;t, happening near the &s;ame Time.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="276">
Having &s;pent the Year but dully, for Want of his
diverting Company at Home, whom to put as
much out of his Mind as he could, he walk'd the
&s;pare Hours he had left from his u&s;ual Occupation;
thus being one Day &s;omething fatigu'd, having lo&s;t
that wonted Alacrity his wonted Chearfulne&s;s did
create, he &s;at down under the next Clu&s;ter of Trees
he came at, and being in a dull Di&s;po&s;ition,
he was &s;oon lull'd a&s;leep, at a lone&s;ome Note of a cer|tain
Sort of melancholly Bird, who &s;huns others
Company (tho' of its own Kind) at all Times but in
Breeding Time; which having plac'd it &s;elf in the
thicke&s;t and &s;haddie&s;t Part of the Grove, where <HI>Quarll</HI>
had made Choice to lie, he falls a &s;inging his melan|cholly
Notes, which being &s;uitable to his Di&s;po&s;ition
of both Body and Mind, &s;oon lull'd him a&s;leep, du|ring
which he dream'd that he &s;aw an old Man &s;it|ting
in a large Circle, around which all the Signs of
the Zodiack were, and the old Gentleman appear'd
extreme bu&s;ie &s;tringing of &s;mall Beeds, &s;ome white
and &s;ome black; and when he had &s;trung a certain
Number, he began another String, and &s;o on. He had
the Curio&s;ity to tell how many he put in a String;
&s;o keeps an Account of the next he did begin, and
tells ju&s;t 60; having made as many of tho&s;e Strings
as there were Beeds in each, he puts them together,
and begins again to &s;tring, mixing white and black as
they came to his Hand, twi&s;ting every &s;ixty String in
Parcels, till he had made &s;ixty of them, which he
neately plates together, &s;o proceeded as from the Be|ginning,
and makes 24 of tho&s;e Plates, which he
weaves together, making a flat Piece of Beed-work,
changeable upon black, which, when look'd upon one
Way &s;eem'd plea&s;ant, and being &s;een from another
as di&s;agreeable. He work'd on till he had made three
hundred and &s;ixty four &s;uch Pieces, then lays them
<PB N="262" REF="277">
up in a Bundle; &s;o goes to Work again, beginning
to &s;tring as at the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Having look'd him&s;elf weary with &s;eeing &s;till the
&s;ame, of which he could make nothing, he goes away
leaving the old Gentleman &s;tringing his Beeds; who
&s;eeing him go, lays by his Work and follows him,
and having overtaken him, ask'd him what he had
been looking at all that Time; he being &s;urpriz'd
at the &s;urly Que&s;tion, he mode&s;tly replies, He had
been admiring his Work, in which doing he hop'd
there was no Offence; No, &s;aid the old Man, pro|viding
thou learne&s;t &s;omething by what thou ha&s;t
&s;een; to which he an&s;wer'd, It was impo&s;&s;ible for
him to learn &s;uch a my&s;terious Bu&s;ine&s;s, with once
&s;eeing it done; &s;o much le&s;s, being entirely a
Stranger to it. A Stranger to it art thou? reply'd
the old Man, in a &s;urly Manner, and ha&s;t wa&s;ted &s;o
much of my Work; I am TIME, whom thou ha&s;t
often ill-us'd, and tho&s;e white and black Beeds, that
thou ha&s;t &s;een me &s;tring, are good and bad Mo|ments,
I crowd into Minutes, which I link into
Hours; thus weave Days, wherewith Years are
compos'd. Thou ha&s;t &s;een me compleat the pre|&s;ent,
which is reckoned the Year 1713. I tell thee
before the en&s;uing is ended, I will grace the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI>
Throne with an illu&s;trious Race, to the End of
Kings Reigns; &s;o vani&s;h'd. Then he awak'd in a
great Surpri&s;e, and goes Home pondering on
his Dream, of which he in&s;err'd that if there
be any Signification in the roving Conceptions
of the Mind, this mu&s;t progno&s;ticate the &s;p$e|dy
A&s;cention of &s;ome great Monarch upon the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Throne; &s;o &s;ets in his Memorial that mo&s;t
remarkable Dream, which happen'd in 1713. hearti|ly
wi&s;hing the Accompli&s;hment thereof, for the
Quiet and Pro&s;perity of his dear Country.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="278">
There happen'd nothing after for the Space of
four Years, but great Thunders and Lightnings in
the Summer, and Abundance of Hail and Snow in
the Winter, with now and then Storms which did
leave &s;everal Sorts of Fi&s;hes in the Clifts and
Holes of the Rocks, and &s;ometimes Fragments of
&s;taven Ships, and batter'd Casks, or broken Che&s;ts,
with a Plank and &s;uch like Products of Ship|wreck,
not worth recording; &s;o, for Want of

for Ea&s;e; that by the Diver&s;ity of Objects Abroad,

Solitude.</P>

commonly did once a Year, the Dream he had in

to his Imagination a mo&s;t Maje&s;tick and
Graceful Monarch, fitting on a magnificent Throne,
round which did &s;tand many delightful Olive-plants,
which much added to his Lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>Having, with a great deal of Plea&s;ure, gaz'd at
the mo&s;t graceful Countenance of the King, which
denoted Ju&s;tice, Equity, Love, and Clemency; he
gave Heaven thanks for the mighty Ble&s;&s;ing be&s;tow'd
