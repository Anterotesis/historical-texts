<HEAD>THE Livery Man`s Rea&s;ons Why he did not give his Vote for a Certain Gentleman either to be Lord Mayor, or Parliament Man for the City of <HI>LONDON.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THO' it might be more proper to enquire of fome People, why they &s;hould over|look &s;o many worthy Gentlemen, who in Cour&s;e &s;tood nearer the Chair, and give their Voices for a Gentleman to be Lord Mayor, yet becau&s;e all Men are not bound to give a Rea|&s;on for what they do, and &s;ome Men can't, I have cho&s;e the other &s;ide, as that which will mo&s;t rea|dily Explain the Matter; and &s;hall con&s;ider &s;ome of their Rea&s;ons afterwards.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">
But to make way to the Enquiry we are upon, 'twill be needful to enter a little into the Hi&s;tory of the pre&s;ent Di&s;pute, and to &s;ee how it came to pa&s;s that He has been the Subject of &s;o much Debate.</P>
<P>This worthy Gentleman had the misfortune to fall under the formidable Di&s;plea&s;ure of the Hou&s;e of Commons, and to be Committed to the Tower, and Expell'd the Hou&s;e, for what Offences I &s;hall not now Examin.</P>
<P>Nor &s;hall I tire my Reader with leading him in|to the Particulars of the Parliaments proceeding a|gain&s;t him which is &s;o fre&s;h in every one's Memo+ry, tho' he who is a Stranger to it, may ea&s;ily be &s;up|po&s;ed to be no Reader of News, and therefore not likely to &s;ee the Contents of this Book.</P>
<P>At the rece&s;s of Parliament, his Enlargement was of cour&s;e, but being out of Favour at Court, he &s;eem`d to retire him&s;elf from Bu&s;ine&s;s when &s;ome People in the City Re&s;olv'd to name him for one of the Sheriffs of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4">
Some &s;ay, He made his Court to the Citizens to do him this Honour a little to recover his Re|putation, which the Parliament's Re&s;entment had given a &s;hock too.</P>
<P>Others tell us, The Citizens according to an old Cu&s;tom, being a Fi&s;hing for Sheriffs or for Money, rather pitcht upon him, riot as a Man they de&s;ir'd &s;hou`d &s;erve, but as a Rich Man who would fine ra|ther than hold, and &s;o they &s;hou`d get Money by him.</P>
<P>I cannot help making this Remark by the way, that I know nothing the Citizens have, to plead for that Cu&s;tom but the Antiquity of it, which is but a &s;mall Reputation; and no way di&s;covers the Hone&s;ty of the Practice.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are of this Opinion tell us, That had not the City unhappily pitcht upon another Over|grown Citizen to match him, they had got the Mo|ney and lo&s;t the Sheriff, which was the Thing intend|ed; but choo&s;ing two &s;uch Men together, as the whole City cou'd not produce the like for E&s;tate, was the Rea&s;on that both held, and the City lo&s;e 800 by the Di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>Whether either of the&s;e Conjectures be right, I do
<PB N="6" REF="5">
not determine, but this is certain, That he was elected Sheriff of <HI>London,</HI> &s;erv'd with a great deal of Splendour, did the City or <HI>Him&s;elf rather</HI> a great deal of Honour, &s;pent abundance of Money, and by a great many Acts of Bounty and Charity became very popular.</P>
<P>The common Voice eccho'd his Prai&s;es, for com|mon Voices beggar-like always prays for the Hand that gives the Farthing; and the Knight pleas`d with the <HI>Ignis fatuus</HI> of Fortune, fancied to him&s;elf &s;he had made him amends for the &s;curvy Kick he had receiv'd from her before, and fell into the Snare.</P>
<P>His Vanity flattered him to believe, that in this <HI>Cri&s;is</HI> nothing wou'd be deny`d him if he did but pu&s;h his good Fortune, and therefore like One, that not u&s;e to &s;lip a favourable Opportunity; he re&s;olv`d to make u&s;e of the Advantage, and &s;eem`d rather to accept of the Honour which the Citizens gave him than to want it! and there is no doubt but he wou'd have &s;hown the City the Sence he had of their Civility in a &s;plendid manner, as a Thing which wou'd &s;erve both to requite them, and at the &s;ame time, maintain the Reputation of his Genero&s;ity, and &s;o an&s;wer two Ends together.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6">
While the Warmth of the People`s Opinion conti|nued, came on the Election for Lord Mayor, and tho' his Office of Sheriff was not expir'd, he nominated by his Friends, which was a Ca&s;e almo&s;t without a Pre|cedent; but &s;uch was the Reputation of his Charity and E&s;tate, &s;uch the Power of his Bounty and Libe|ral Way of Living, and &s;uch the Expectation of great Things to be done for the City, that he carried it in the Common-Hall by a Vi&s;ible Majority, and in the Poll by above 500 Voices.</P>
<P>But an unhappy and unexpected Circum&s;tance in the Cu&s;tom of the City ruin`d his Expectation, for the Common-Hall of the City, that is, the Voices of the Livery-men, are to choo&s;e two Per&s;ons to be pre|&s;ented to the Court of Aldermen, out of which the Court of Aldermen were obliged to return one for Lord Mayor, but may return which of the Two they or a Majority of them &s;hall choo&s;e.</P>
<P>Now tho' they are ab&s;olutely free to choo&s;e which of the Two they plea&s;e, yet it has been a received Practice and Cu&s;tom in that Court, always to return the Elde&s;t Alderman; and it has been but very rarely, that they have broke in upon that Cu&s;tom, and never without &s;ome Extraordinary Cau&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7">
In this ca&s;e there appear'd no very Extraordi|nary Occa&s;ion, and Sir <HI>C</HI>&mdash;having been cho&s;en Alderman of the <HI>Bridge-Ward</HI> but a few Weeks before, the Court of Aldermen therefore thought fit to return Sir <HI>Thomas Abney</HI> Lord Mayor, as the Se|nior Alderman.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>C</HI>&mdash;did not appear &s;o much concern'd at the Repul&s;e, as his Friends were who had u&s;ed all their Intere&s;t for his Election, and were exceedingly mov'd at the Proceedings tho' not able to remedy it.</P>
<P>But to make them&s;elves amends, and try their Strength again, they put him upon appearing as a Candidate for the City, to &s;erve them in the En&s;uing Parliament.</P>
<P>And I mu&s;t do Sir <HI>C</HI>&mdash;this Ju&s;tice, that his &s;tanding for Parliament Man in the City, does not &s;eem &s;o much his own Act and Deed, from a De|&s;ire to be a Member of Parliament, as it is the Act and Deed of a Party, who &s;et him up to try the Power of their Intere&s;t in the City, and to &s;trengthen it with his.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>C</HI>&mdash;was already cho&s;en for the Town of <HI>Ip&s;wich,</HI> and &s;ure of &s;itting in the Hou&s;e, and never given him&s;elf the Trouble, nor run the Ri&s;que of the Slur he has &s;ince received, had he not been de&s;ir'd
<PB N="9" REF="8">
to head a Party who claim'd &s;o much of him, as he had been &s;erv'd by them before in the Elect$on for Lord Mayor.</P>
<P>And this as it &s;eems to be the Original of his appear|ing, leads us into the Rea&s;ons which others had to Oppo&s;e him.</P>
<P>And that we may prepare the World, to know that we have very good Rea&s;ons for what we have done, we are fir&s;t to declare, That as this Book is not de&s;ign'd for an Invective again&s;t that worthy Gentleman, &s;o it is not any Rea&s;on drawn from his Per&s;onal Conduct, which has bia&s;t our judgment in the Ca&s;e, but from a &s;ub&s;tantial regard to the Ho|nour and Safety of the City, and of the Nation.</P>
<P>If therefore the following Particulars are real Matters of Fact, we hope they may be alledged as good and ju&s;tifiable Cau&s;es, why we have given our Votes again&s;t this Generous Gentleman in both the&s;e particular Errours.</P>
<P>We know as <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men, Free-men of <HI>London,</HI> and Livery-men; we have an unaccounted Right of Voting, as our Fancy or Judgment guides us, with|out being accountable &s;o much as to our &s;elves. But
<PB N="10" REF="9">
&s;ince every Wi&s;e Man is able to give a Rea&s;on for what he does; and that we may appear Rational Creatures; and thereby di&s;tingui&s;h our &s;elves from &s;ome of our Fellow-Citizens, we &s;hall con&s;ider &s;ome Circum&s;tances in the Ca&s;e, which if they ap|pear True in Fact, may pa&s;s for &s;ufficient Rea&s;ons in the Ca&s;e.</P>
<Q><L>And Fir&s;t for our oppo&s;ing him as Lord Mayor.</L></Q>
<P>We pre&s;ume every Citizen will grant that your Office of Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> which in many Ca|&s;es, is the highe&s;t Po&s;t of Civil Power a Subject is capable of; ought to be Executed by &s;uch Per&s;ons only, who are more than ordinarily qualified for a Tru&s;t of &s;uch Con&s;equence. The Government of this Populous wealthy City, $is certainly a thing of &s;uch Con&s;equence to the Safety and Peace of this City, and of &s;o much Honour to the Per&s;on Entru&s;t|ed with it; that it is not a &s;light Affair, but every Ci|tizen is concern'd to &s;ee, according to his proportion of Concern in the Ca&s;e, that it be committed to a Per&s;on of Hone&s;ty and Merit.</P>
<P>Now tho' we &s;hall be very Chary in making Re|flections on the Per&s;on we are &s;peaking of, yet while the Supream Expo&s;itors of our Laws and Accounts;
<PB N="11" REF="10">
the Parliament had by Unanimous &s;uffrage, Voted him Guilty of &s;uch a Crime, as they thought &s;uffici|ent to Expel him their Hou&s;e; we think that alone might pa&s;s for a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on, why we did not give our Con&s;ent to make him our Chief Magi|&s;trate.</P>
<P>To expel men from the Society of a Party or Bo|dy of People, is the highe&s;t executive part of Pow|er any Body of People have; all Puni&s;hment be|&s;ides, are inferior to it.</P>
<P>Death inflicted on a Capital Malefactor is fully expre&s;s'd thus, That &s;uch a one having committed a dete&s;table and execrable Crime, as Murther or Trea&s;on is; Put to Death, that is, expell'd the World as unfit for Humane Society; and all Fines, Impri&s;onments, Brandings and Whippings, and Pil|lories are counted higher Puni&s;hments, which the Offender receives from the mercy of a Court, to ex|cu&s;e him from the greater Puni&s;hment of Death: And therefore of Old, when an Offender was burnt in the Hand, 'twas a Cu&s;tom to make him kneel down and pray God to ble&s;s the King, as an acknow|ledgment of his Maje&s;ty's Mercy, in di&s;mi&s;&s;ing him with &s;o light a Puni&s;hment, where a greater was de&s;erved.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11">
'Tis the like in common Society, the highe&s;t Re|&s;entment one Man can Legally expre&s;s at another, is to &s;ay, he will have no more to do with him, or he will not come into his Company; all farther Re&s;entments, as ill Language, Quarrellings, and Blows, are Extravagant and Illegal.</P>
<P>'Tis the like in Sacred Power, where Excommu|nication is the &s;evere&s;t Cen&s;ure; and is expre&s;t by ca&s;ting out a Per&s;on from the Society of Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>If then a Parliament of <HI>England</HI> thinks fit, to expel any Member from their Society for a per&s;onal Crime, the Engli&s;h of it &s;eems to be this; That he has been guilty of &s;uch a Crime, as they think, de&s;erves their highe&s;t Re&s;entment as a Hou&s;e, and that they judge him unworthy to be in their Company, or to repre|&s;ent any part of the People of <HI>England;</HI> and `twas alluded to: Thus, by the Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Commons, in the Ca&s;e of Sir <HI>Robert Payton</HI> in the late Times, when he told Sir <HI>Robert, the Hou&s;e &s;pu|ed him out;</HI> one expre&s;&s;ing thereby, that as in the Body Natural, when the Stomach is overcharg'd with any thing offen&s;ive, Nature di&s;gorges it &s;elf by a violent re-percu&s;&s;ion, and ca&s;ts up what it can|not dige&s;t; &s;o in the Body Pollitick, when a Cri|minal
<PB N="13" REF="12">
is found in the Legi&s;lative Society, the Go|vernment feels a Convul&s;ion, and cannot be ea&s;ie till it has di&s;charg'd it &s;elf of the Load.</P>
<P>'Tis true, we have had very Honourable Per|&s;ons expell'd the Hou&s;e upon qualifying Niceties without Crimes, but that does not at all reach the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>As to the Crime for which this Gentleman was thus &s;everely handled; we have nothing to do with it here, nor does the Parliament need any Advocates, to defend the ju&s;tice of their Proceedings: Any man may pre&s;ume, the Hou&s;e had Rea&s;on for what they did, without running the hazard of a Reflection on his Faith for being too Implicite.</P>
<P>Since then this Gentleman lay under the Mi&s;for|tune afore&s;aid, we think it may be allow'd as a ve|ry good Rea&s;on, why we did not think him proper|ly qualified for our Chief Magi&s;trate.</P>
<P>The Lord Mayor of <HI>London</HI> is an Office of very great Concern, Life and Death, Ju&s;tice and Equity, Right and Wrong, Peace and Pro&s;perity are in his Hands; and therefore we think, he who is recom|mended to that Place, ought to be a Per&s;on of an Un|blemi&s;ht
<PB N="14" REF="13">
Life, and, if po&s;&s;ible, of an un&s;potted Reputation.</P>
<P>To have placed a Per&s;on to repre&s;ent the King, whom the Parliament thought unworthy to repre|&s;ent the People, &s;eems but a very mean Compli|ment to his Maje&s;ty; to have cho&s;en a per&s;on voted a Criminal by the whole Repre&s;entatives of the Ci|ty, as well as Kingdom, to pre&s;ide in doing Ju|&s;tice upon Criminals; &s;eem'd a mo&s;t prepo&s;terous contradiction.</P>
<P>In the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> every Livery-man of <HI>London</HI> is &s;uppo&s;ed actually &s;itting by our Repre|&s;entatives; if &s;o, then the Livery-men of <HI>London</HI> having fir&s;t Voted him Guilty of &s;uch a Crime, for which they thought fit to expel him the Hou&s;e, and afterwards the &s;ame Livery-men &s;et him up in the Chair of Government, to Rule tho&s;e people he was not worthy to repre&s;ent, was &s;o contradictory to common Sen&s;e, that we cannot &s;atisfie our &s;elves to act upon &s;uch manife&s;t Ab&s;urdities, e&s;peci|ally in Matters of &s;uch Con&s;equence.</P>
<P>We are content to wave the Objection again&s;t the Morals of the Gentleman concern'd, becau&s;e we &s;hall avoid per&s;onal Reflections, and leave his
<PB N="15" REF="14">
way of living to him&s;elf, and him to whom he mu&s;t account for it only: 'Tis confe&s;t on the other hand, That the Lord Mayor of <HI>London</HI> being a per&s;on, who mu&s;t have a great hand in Re&s;ormation of Manners, if ever any thing to purpo&s;e be done in it, the &s;ucce&s;s of it would be very precarious if he &s;hou'd be a man of Vice him&s;elf; and were we &s;ure of his Life being &s;candalous that way, 'twou'd be a very ju&s;tifiable Rea&s;on to reject him as a Ma|gi&s;trate, but we leave that to tho&s;e who know him better than we do, to determine.</P>
<P>Secondly,</P>
<P>As Lord Mayor, we did not conceive him put upon us &s;o fairly as we think he ought to be, and that on &s;everal Accounts.</P>
<P>When the De&s;ign of &s;etting him up for Lord Mayor, was form'd he was not an Alderman, nor was there any extraordinary pro&s;pect of making him &s;o, till a new fa&s;hion'd way, <HI>we cannot call it Bri|bery,</HI> of gaining Suffrages was entred upon by which the Ward was brought about, like the King of <HI>Po|land</HI>'s Election contrary to expectation; by which we may under&s;tand, what &s;trange influence a good pair of Organs have on a Congregation, tho they were but re&s;erv'd in <HI>Petto;</HI> neither as the <HI>Pope</HI> does
<PB N="16" REF="15">
by the Cardinals, to pre&s;erve their Dependance on him.</P>
<P>Any one might &s;ee what time of day 'twas by &s;uch a Dyal; no &s;ooner was he made an Alder|man, but that making an Intere&s;t for him to be Lord Mayor &s;ucceeded. Now to us it &s;eem'd Rational, that whereas it was an extraordinary thing, and un|known within the Memory of Man, to put up a Man to be Mayor that had not fini&s;hed the Office of She|riff; was not only the Junior Alderman, but &s;o young as but of a few Weeks &s;tanding, and &s;o many worthy Gentlemen before him who &s;tood nearer the Chair, and were unexceptionable in their Reputation; we &s;ay, it &s;eem'd very rational, that &s;ince this was &s;uch an extraordinary Ca&s;e, &s;ome very extraordinary Rea&s;on &s;hould be given for it.</P>
<P>Now all the Rea&s;on we could ever yet meet with for it, be&s;ides the Will of the Parties was, That their Gentleman was extraordinary Rich, and if the City did him &s;uch an Honour, he wou'd certainly do &s;ome great Thing for them, and e|recting Statues, and Building Pallaces for the Re|&s;idence of the Lord Mayor, were the lea&s;t things they talk'd of.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="16">
The&s;e Things &s;eem'd &s;o far from being Rea&s;ons to us, that really in them&s;elves the are Rea&s;ons why any Body that values the Honour of the City &s;hou'd not have cho&s;en him. For if Publick Buildings and co&s;tly Statues, are proper Conditions to engage the City to make Magi&s;trates, then we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e the City of <HI>London</HI> very Needy and Mercenary too: We neither &s;ee &s;o much Benefit by, nor &s;o much need of any &s;uch Publick Acts, as to di&s;po&s;e of the Government of the City on &s;uch Conditions.</P>
<P>We do not &s;ay, the Gentleman we are &s;peaking of, propo&s;ed the&s;e Things as Conditions of his Ele|ction, but his Friends and Party talk'd them about, and made u&s;e of them as Arguments, to prevail on People to Poll for him.</P>
<P>It has always been the U&s;age of &s;uch People, who have attempted to oblige the City, to exert their Acts of Merit fir&s;t, as the mo&s;t Generous Ap|peal to the City to judge of them by: But to have the City begin to heap her Favours upon a Per&s;on fir&s;t, in Expectation of his Bounty afterwards by way of Gratitude, is turning the Tables upon the City, and giving her the wrong End of the Staff.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="17">
We are therefore, hitherto de&s;titute of tho&s;e ex|traordinary Rea&s;ons, which &s;hou'd prevail upon us to put Matters out of Cour&s;e, and to break into the Cu&s;toms and Ancient U&s;age of the City, and 'till tho&s;e Extraordinaries do appear, we think our Old Cu&s;tom and U&s;age a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on, to move us to go on in cour&s;e,</P>
<P>A Third Rea&s;on in this ca&s;e, is the Number of Worthy Gentlemen unexceptionable in their Per&s;ons, &s;ufficient in their E&s;tates, untainted in their Morals, unblemi&s;h'd in their Reputation who &s;tood nearer the Chair as we &s;ay; that is, who were Senior Aldermen, and had &s;erv'd as Sheriffs long before him.</P>
<P>Now tho' we know, that it is in our Right to pa&s;s over the Heads of any Per&s;on, and choo&s;e Who and Where we plea&s;e; yet &s;ince laying a Gentleman a&s;ide, and taking another in his room, when ac|cording to the Ancient Cu&s;tom of the City he might rea&s;onably expect it, &s;eems to imply &s;omething de|fective in, or &s;ome Di&s;like of that Gentleman, and is a Point every Man &s;hould be very tender in. We therefore, cou'd not be &s;atisfied to put &s;uch a &s;light upon tho&s;e Worthy Gentlemen, without be|ing able to a&s;&s;ign &s;ome cau&s;e, why they &s;hould
<PB N="19" REF="18">
not be thought Worthy to &s;erve the City accord|ing to Expectation.</P>
<P><HI>We come next to our</HI> Rea&s;ons, again&s;t our Electing him for Member of Parliament.</P>
<P>And <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It might pa&s;s for a Rea&s;on &s;ufficient again&s;t all the World, that he having been ad|judged Criminal by the la&s;t Parliament as is be|fore mention'd, it looks like flying in the Face of the Nation and Parliament, to elect &s;uch a One to repre&s;ent the Capital City of the Kingdom, who was by the la&s;t Parliament expell'd the Hou&s;e, and deem'd unworthy to repre&s;ent a &s;mall <HI>York&s;hire</HI> Village.</P>
<P N="2">2. Nor have we any Extraordinary Demon&s;tra|tion of his being a Per&s;on, fitly qualified to repre|&s;ent this Loyal Prote&s;tant City by being a Hearty Friend, to the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;ht Government; we do not &s;ay, he is di&s;affected to the Government, and de&s;ire to be under&s;tood right, but there's an Old <HI>Latin</HI> Sentence which is generally true.</P>
<Q><L>No&s;citur ex Socio qui non digno&s;citur ex &s;e.</L></Q>
<P>And we &s;ee that all the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Party, who are
<PB N="20" REF="19">
profe&s;t Enemies to the Government, adhere to him, Vote for him and Mu&s;ter up all their Friends to do the $ame.</P>
<P>Now as when a Prince or State &s;trengthen them|&s;elves with Alliances, makes Leagues Offen&s;ive and Defen&s;ive, rai&s;es Soldiers, fits out Fleet, or makes any Warlike Preparations, it fills the Neighbouring Princes with Jealou&s;ies of their De&s;igns; &s;o when a Gentleman makes his Court to a Party, which we know, wi&s;h the pre&s;ent Con&s;titution no good, and when we &s;ee them a&s;&s;i&s;t him with all the Di|ligence po&s;&s;ible: This may be allow'd to be &s;ufficient Ground of Su&s;pition, that they are all in one Intre&s;t.</P>
<P>We conceive there is no one Thing, in which we ought to be more Nice, than in the choice of Per|&s;ons to repre&s;ent us in Parliament; for we put our E&s;tates, or Liberties, Religion, Families, King, Crown and Nation into their Hands; and no Man ought to &s;it in that Hou&s;e for us, who is the lea&s;t to be &s;u&s;pected of Partiality to a Party; or that has any Intere&s;t to manage there, but what is for the Good and Pro&s;perity of his Native Countries and the Prote&s;tant Religion.</P>
<P>And if this Gentleman were the be&s;t Friend to the
<PB N="21" REF="20">
Government that could be, yet if 'tis his misfortune to be &s;u&s;pected from the Company he keeps with, and a&s;&s;i&s;tance he accepts from the Nations Ene|mies, 'tis his own fault that he does not more pub|lickly di&s;countenance and di&s;courage that Party, which does his Character &s;o much Injury.</P>
<P>It is not enough at this juncture that we avoid Electing &s;uch as are Profe&s;t Enemies, and who publickly appear to be &s;o; there is le&s;s dan|ger in a Profe&s;t than in a private Enemy; but we are to take care to elect Men more than or|dinary remarkable for their Zeal to the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment; Patriots for their Country, and Champions again&s;t Popery and Tyranny, if &s;uch are to be found.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty has told us, He is to advi&s;e with his Parliament about Matters of the highe&s;t Im|portance to this Kingdom; which is in it &s;elf a tacit Caution to us, to choo&s;e &s;uch for our Repre&s;enta|tives, who are the King and the Nations Friends, and qualified to be their Advi&s;ers, and to have any Man but &s;u&s;pected of the contrary, to &s;ee him &s;o|ciate
<PB N="22" REF="21">
with, and be backt and upheld by a con|trary Party, is &s;ufficient to give us &s;o much Um|brage in the Ca&s;e, as to be very &s;ly of commit|ting &s;o great a Tru&s;t to his Conduct.</P>
<P>But were this no Rea&s;on at all, we conceive we are ju&s;tifiable in oppo&s;ing this Gentleman's Election on this account, That the Election for the City of <HI>London,</HI> had more of De&s;ign in it than reality; there was a Project in it, a Tale at the end of it; a Snake in the Gra&s;s, which every one did not fore&s;ee.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Tis apparent, the End was not barely to have that Gentleman be a Parliament Man, ^1 for he was already &s;ecure of that at <HI>Ip&s;witch,</HI> and could have had it in another Place if he had mi&s;|&s;ed it there.</P>
<P>But the De&s;ign was to divide the City, and try the &s;trength of a Party in order to carry on fur|ther Affairs, po&s;&s;ibly to make way for a future E|lection to the Mayoralty, and partly in favour of
<PB N="23" REF="22">
a party lately too much made the Subject of De|bate between the <HI>Two Rival Companies,</HI> and a|bove all, 'tis plain 'twas pu&s;ht at to keep out tho&s;e Hone&s;t Gentlemen, who have &s;o honourably ac|quitted them&s;elves in that Tru&s;t already.</P>
<P>Now had there been no other Rea&s;ons than this, that his &s;tanding as a Candidate for the Ci|ty, was to carry on the Intere&s;t of a party, and thereby divide the City which is always the oc|ca&s;ions of Heats and Feuds among us; this were enough to ju&s;tifie our oppo&s;ing him.</P>
<P>No Body could have blam'd him to have u&s;ed his utmo&s;t Intre&s;t, and that of his Friends too, in or|der to be Cho&s;en a Repre&s;entative for the City; had he had no De&s;ign but to &s;it in the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>But to &s;tand for the City when he was already Elected in another place, mu&s;t imply one of the&s;e Con&s;equences.</P>
<P>Either that it was done to gratifie his own Am|bition
<PB N="24" REF="23">
in being Cho&s;en for the Capital City of the Kingdom, and to Tell the Hou&s;e that their ex|pelling him, had not at all weaken'd his Reputa|tion, but rather encrea&s;ed it.</P>
<P>Or it mu&s;t be done to uphold a Party who &s;tood in need of his New begotten Intere&s;t to up|hold theirs, who again in their turn would uphold his on the like occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Now be it for which of the&s;e two Rea&s;ons it will, both of them &s;ignifie to us, that his &s;tanding in the City was not upon a right Foundation, and ac|cordingly we have let him know that we &s;hall neither Vote for him nor any Man el&s;e, who&s;e De&s;ignn is rather to foment and &s;upport a Party, than really to &s;erve the City.</P>
<P>'Tis a time of Day when Union and Peace with one another, is more than u&s;ually nece&s;|&s;ary, the Conjunction of formidable Powers broad, and the Encrea&s;e of ill-natur'd People at home, gives us but a melancholly Pro&s;pect of
<PB N="25" REF="24">
Affairs; our peace &s;eems to be but &s;hort-liv`d a|broad, our Trade in danger; if a War follows again, our King will be in danger; and he mu&s;t be very &s;hort &s;ighted, who does not perceive the Prote&s;tant Religion is in danger, and if ever Union was nece&s;&s;ary, 'tis now; and in order to it, we think 'tis every man's Intere&s;t to oppo&s;e them, that foment Parties and Divi&s;ions among&s;t us.</P>
<P>As for the Rea&s;ons on the other hand, all we can yet hear of, why this Gentleman was thus ha&s;tily &s;et up, over the Heads of &s;o many emi|nent Citizens, are the&s;e;</P>
<P>Fir&s;t,</P>
<P>He was va&s;tly Rich, and the City &s;tood in need of an extraordinary Man that way.</P>
<P>Secondly,</P>
<P>He was in the Humour of &s;pending his Mony in order to become popular, and they were for ta|king him by the right handle, and make the be&s;t of him.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="25">
As to the Want the City has of Opulent Men, who are able to do a great many fine Things for them; tho' much might be &s;aid to it, I'll let it pa&s;s for a Rea&s;on, only making this Remark upon it; The City has always need of Good Ma|gi&s;trates, qualified to promote Ju&s;tice, pre&s;erve Peace, and encourage Good Manners, to &s;uppre&s;s Vice and Prophanene&s;s; and he that is not thus qualified be he never &s;o Wealthy, Charitable or Magnificent, is not the Man the City has an Oc|ca&s;ion for.</P>
<P>As to Taking the Advantage of the Liberality of this Gentleman, and to gratifie him that he may &s;pend his Money among&s;t us.</P>
<P>This is &s;wallowing the Bait laid on purpo&s;e, whoever thinks he is &s;o lavi&s;h of his Ca&s;h, only from a meer Principle of Genero&s;ity without any De&s;ign; mu&s;t be very ignorant of the Hi&s;tory of this Gentleman, and know very little either of him or the World.</P>
<P>And if he has other De&s;igns, 'Tis proper they &s;hou'd be known too, before we own our &s;elves &s;o exceedingly oblig'd to his Munificence.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="26">
If he has a &s;ullied Reputation to rai&s;e, if he has a Figure to make, in Order to make him formidable to &s;ome People; if he has need of a good Name, in Order to &s;et him right either at Court, in Parliament, or el&s;ewhere; if he has his Natural Ambition to gratifie, if he has an abdicated Party, or an Old <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Company to encourage, or if he has any Se|parate or Private Intere&s;t to uphold and carry on; he has took exact Mea&s;ures by Publick Charities and Generous Behaviour, to get on the blind &s;ide of the City: But &s;till, Gentlemen, you are oblig'd to the De|&s;ign not the Man, and I know no Body will be ob|lig'd to your Ignorance, if you gratifie him in it.</P>
<P>For our Parts we think, without any Di&s;re&s;pect to his Per&s;on, his &s;etting him&s;elf up as the Head of a Par|ty, by which Heats, Feuds, Ill natur'd Divi&s;ions and Di&s;tractions have been &s;o much reviv'd among us, at a Time when Peace and Unanimity is &s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to our Happine&s;s, wou'd be &s;ufficient Rea|&s;on to engage any Rational Man again&s;t him, that is &s;en&s;ible of the True Intere&s;t of <HI>England</HI> in general, and of this City in particular.</P>
<P>And that he did do &s;o is evident, for that he was actually cho&s;en a Member of the Hou&s;e, before the Election for the City came on.</P>
