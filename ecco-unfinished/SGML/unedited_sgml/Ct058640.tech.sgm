<HEAD>TO THE
QUEEN.</HEAD>
<P>DURING childhood, every ob|ject
&s;trikes the mind with the
force of novelty; and the mind,
&s;oft like wax, yields to every im|pre&s;&s;ion,
good or bad. To cheri&s;h
the former and to prevent the lat|ter,
is the province of the mother;
for as &s;he is entru&s;ted by Provi|dence
with the government of her
children during their tender years,
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
the mind ought to be no le&s;s her
care than the body.</P>
<P>THE children of Princes are in a
critical &s;tate with re&s;pect to edu|cation:
they have none but their
mother to pre&s;erve them from the
corruption of flattery and fawning.
If they have lo&s;t her early, they
are undone.</P>
<P>IT has fallen to your MAJESTY'S
lot, to take the lead in the educa|tion
of a numerous and hopeful
Royal Family; and if fame &s;peak
true, Providence has not in re&s;erve
a per&s;on more worthy of that im|portant
office: it is laborious in|deed,
but plea&s;ing to a mother.
<PB N="v" REF="4">
May Heaven, pro&s;pering your ma|ternal
tenderne&s;s and per&s;everance,
make your children what you wi&s;h
them to be, affectionate to their
parents, kindly to their dependents,
and in time illu&s;trious examples of
good conduct to the Briti&s;h nation.</P>
<P>A Royal Family &s;o educated may
be relied on as a firm &s;upport to
the Throne.</P>
<P>THE purpo&s;e of this E&s;&s;ay is to
evince, that the culture of the
heart during childhood, is the chief
branch of education. I have little
doubt of convincing tho&s;e who are
di&s;po&s;ed to give attention; but dry
&s;ubjects &s;eem at pre&s;ent not to be in
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
reque&s;t. One &s;ure way there is to
procure attention; and I know no
other. If your MAJESTY will gra|ciou&s;ly
conde&s;cend to patroni&s;e this
little Work, it will become fa&s;hion|able:
every one will read: a num|ber
will approve; and perhaps a
few will &s;eriou&s;ly think of a re|formation.</P>
<P>BUT imitation is more per&s;ua&s;ive
than exhortation. Though in this
degenerate age, our women of fa|&s;hion,
neglecting dome&s;tic concerns,
&s;eem to think every hour lo&s;t that
does not pa&s;s in a crowd; yet your
MAJESTY's examplary conduct can|not
fail to have great influence.
Many it will reclaim to a more &s;e|date
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
and more rational tenor of
life; and your pro&s;elytes, happy in
the change, will chearfully te&s;tify
to the world a &s;acred truth, That a
mother's &s;weete&s;t plea&s;ure, ari&s;es
from preparing her children, by
virtuous education, to be happy in
this life, as well as in the life to
come.</P>
<P>MAY your MAJESTY'S life be long
and pro&s;perous, not only for your
own &s;ake, but for that of our Sove|reign,
of your Royal I&s;&s;ue, and of
the Nation.</P>

CULTURE OF THE HEART<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The Head is the &s;eat of thinking, deliberating, rea&s;oning, willing, and of all other internal actions. The Heart is the &s;eat of emotions and pa&s;&s;ions; and of moral perceptions, &s;uch as right and wrong, good and bad, prai&s;e and blame, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> See Elements of Critici&s;m, $edit. 5. vol.

<DIV2>
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE mind of man is a rich &s;oil,
productive equally of flowers and
weeds. Good pa&s;&s;ions and impre&s;&s;ions
are flowers which ought carefully to be
cultivated bad pa&s;&s;ions and impre&s;&s;ions
<PB N="2" REF="11">
are weeds which ought to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed,
if they cannot be totally rooted out.
Such moral culture is no &s;light art: it
requires a complete knowledge of the
human heart, of all its mazes, and of
all its bia&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>As impre&s;&s;ions made in childhood are
the deepe&s;t and the mo&s;t permanent, the
plan of our Creator for giving acce&s;s to
the heart, even in that early period, can|not
be too much admired. The fir&s;t
thing ob&s;ervable is, an innate &s;en&s;e that
enables us to di&s;cover internal pa&s;&s;ions
from their external &s;igns<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Elements of Critici&s;m, edit. 5. vol. I. p. 441.</NOTE>. As that &s;en&s;e
is of prime u&s;e in every period of life,
it early attains to full exerci&s;e; indeed as
early as the &s;en&s;es of &s;eeing and hearing
do. An infant on the brea&s;t di&s;cerns
good or bad humour in its nur&s;e, from
their external &s;igns on her countenance,
and f$$m the different tones of her voice.
<PB N="3" REF="12">
Next, the&s;e &s;igns and tones affect the
infant differently: a &s;ong or a &s;mile,
chears it: a har&s;h look or tone, makes it
afraid, or keeps it in awe.</P>
<P>BY the&s;e means, the human heart lies
open to early in&s;truction; and is &s;u&s;cep|tible
of having proper notions &s;tamped
on it, &s;uch as tho&s;e of right and wrong,
of prai&s;e and blame, of benevolence and
&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, of yours and mine. The great
utility of &s;uch notions, will appear from
oppo&s;ing them to various ab&s;urd notions
and opinions, which never could have pre|vailed
in the world, had they not been in|culcated
during infancy. Take the follow|ing
in&s;tances. Stories of gho&s;ts and hob|goblins
heard for the fir&s;t time by one
grown up, make no impre&s;&s;ion unle&s;s it
be of laughter; but &s;tamped on the mind
of a child, they harra&s;s it ince&s;&s;antly,
and are never totally obliterated. Many
Popi&s;h doctrines are contradictory to
<PB N="4" REF="13">
common &s;en&s;e; and yet held to be &s;elf-evident,
becau&s;e they were in&s;tilled du|ring
childhood. What is it that can
rivet in the mind of any one the &s;trange
doctrine of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, but the
taking advantage of early youth, which
is &s;u&s;ceptible equally of every impre&s;&s;ion,
right or wrong? Were that doctrine re|&s;erved
for adult per&s;ons, it would be re|jected
by all for its eminent ab&s;urdity.
The low people in Spain have little o|ther
notion of a Chri&s;tian, but of one
who &s;igns him&s;elf with the cro&s;s; and
yet are prone to blood and &s;laughter
again&s;t every per&s;on who forbears that
trifling ceremony. When notions that
have no foundation in nature take &s;uch
hold of the mind, it cannot be doubted
but that notions grafted on &s;ome natural
principle or affection will be equally per|manent.
Therefore, let it be the fir&s;t care
of parents to in&s;til into their children right
notions, which can be done by looks and
<PB N="5" REF="14">
ge&s;tures, even before a child is capable
of under&s;tanding what is &s;aid to it. With
regard to families of di&s;tinction in par|ticular,
this branch of education is of the
highe&s;t importance. Even before the age
of &s;even, notions of rank, of opulence,
of &s;uperiority in the children of &s;uch
families, begin to break out, and to ren|der
them le&s;s ob&s;equious to di&s;cipline
than in their more tender years; and if
admitted to take peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,
adieu to education of any &s;ort.</P>
<P>ROUSSEAU advances a &s;trange opinion,
that children are incapable of in&s;truction
before the age of twelve. This opinion,
confined to the under&s;tanding, is per|haps
not far from truth. But was it his
opinion, that children before twelve are
incapable of being in&s;tructed in matters
of right and wrong, of love and hatred,
or of other feelings that have an original
&s;eat in the heart? If it was, gro&s;s mu&s;t
<PB N="6" REF="15">
have been his ignorance of human na|ture.
And yet that this was really his
opinion, appears from his in&s;i&s;ting that
a child ought not to be puni&s;hed for
telling a lie; which can have no foun|dation
other than that a child is not
con&s;cious of doing wrong when it tells
a lie, more than when it tells truth.
If the difference between truth and fal&s;e|hood
be innate, which it &s;urely is, why
ought not a child to be puni&s;hed for
telling a lie, if the vice cannot be re|&s;trained
by gentler means?</P>
<P>INFANCY is a bu&s;y &s;cene, and yet little
attended to, except for the &s;ake of health.
As this period is &s;hort, every opportunity
ought to be taken, for in&s;tilling right
notions and making proper impre&s;&s;ions.
The infant, at the &s;ame time, is bu&s;y in
gathering for it&s;elf a &s;tock of ideas from
the various objects of the external &s;en&s;es,
ready to be uttered as &s;oon as it can &s;peak,
which commonly is before the age of two:
<PB N="7" REF="16">
the difficulty it has to &s;truggle with, is
not want of ideas, but want of words. It
is wonderful to what degree of under|&s;tanding
&s;ome children arrive very early.
A child named Martha, three years old,
had been told jocularly, that Martha or
Mattie was an ugly name, and that &s;he
ought to have been called Matilda. The
child was overheard &s;aying to a younger
&s;i&s;ter, who had not yet got the u&s;e of her
tongue, &startq;When you can &s;peak, you mu&s;t
not call me Mattie, which is an ugly
name, but Matilda.&endq; There are in|&s;tances
without number of the &s;ame kind;
and in tracing the progre&s;s of the mind
they de&s;erve well to be recorded.</P>
<P>THE education of girls is by nature
entru&s;ted to the mother; and of boys,
till they are fit for regular di&s;cipline at
&s;chool. The father occa&s;ionally may give
a helping hand, but it can only be occa|&s;ionally.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="17">
THUS the culture of the heart during
childhood, the mo&s;t precious time for &s;uch
culture, is a ta&s;k with which females
only are charged by providence; a vo|cation
that ought to employ their ut|mo&s;t
&s;agacity and per&s;everance; a voca|tion
not inferior in dignity, as will ap|pear
afterward, to any that belongs to
the other &s;ex. Yet children, during that
precious time, are commonly abandoned
to nur&s;es and &s;ervants. The mother is
indeed attentive to the health of her
child; and flatters her&s;elf that nothing
further is required from her. But it can|not
be expected, that early education will
be regarded by a mother who is igno|rant
of its advantages.</P>
<P>THIS is deplorable, e&s;pecially as there
are &s;everal ob&s;tacles to a remedy. One
is, that there is no &s;chool, public or pri|vate,
for teaching the the art of cultivating
the heart. Nor is it an art of a &s;light
<PB N="9" REF="18">
kind: few arts are more complicated or
more profound. Another is, that this
art, as the world goes, appears to be little
in reque&s;t; and, I believe, is &s;eldom
thought of in chu&s;ing a wife. A young
man, inclined to avarice, di&s;covers no
virtue in a young woman but a plen|tiful
fortune. Another, addicted to the
plea&s;ures of &s;en&s;e, regards beauty only.
A prudent man, having nothing in view
but an agreeable companion, is &s;atisfied
with a &s;weet temper and affable manners.
The art of training up children is never
thought of, though of all the mo&s;t e&s;&s;en|tial
in a mother.</P>
<P>ZEAL to have &s;uch ob&s;tacles removed,
&s;ugge&s;ted to me the following E&s;&s;ay. Sen|&s;ible
I am, that in its pre&s;ent loo&s;e attire,
it is &s;carce fit to appear in public; but
may not the uncertainty of life in an ad|vanced
age, plead my excu&s;e? I &s;hould
have ended life with regret, had any
<PB N="10" REF="19">
thing been left undone by me, that could
benefit my fellow creatures. Were it ge|nerally
under&s;tood, that the education of
children is the mother's peculiar province,
an important tru&s;t committed to her by
her Maker, education during that early
period would, I am per&s;uaded, be carried
on more accurately than it is at pre&s;ent.
With re&s;pect to the education of female
children in particular, genteel accompli&s;h|ments,
&s;uch as mu&s;ic and dancing, need
not be rejected; but in order to accom|pli&s;h
them as mothers, the knowledge of
human nature and the art of improving
the heart, would chiefly be in&s;i&s;ted on.
This art would have a beneficial influence
on the conduct of married women. In|&s;tead
of roaming abroad for want of oc|cupation
at home, the dignified occupa|tion
of educating their children, would
be their mo&s;t charming amu&s;ement. The
hu&s;band, happy in his wife and in his
children, would in no other place find
<PB N="11" REF="20">
the comfort of his own hou&s;e. The chil|dren,
early in&s;pired with morality and re|ligion,
would be prepared to perform
with alacrity every duty, and to &s;tand
firm again&s;t every temptation.</P>
<P>How di&s;tant from &s;uch a &s;tate are per|&s;ons
in high life, who, in great cities, are
engaged in a perpetual round of plea&s;ure!
Take for in&s;tance routs and card-a&s;&s;em|blies.
Excepting tho&s;e at the card-tables,
who make but a &s;mall part of the com|pany,
the re&s;t &s;aunter about, looking at
one another, wi&s;hing in vain to have
&s;omething to &s;ay. Whether frequency
does not render &s;uch meetings wofully
in&s;ipid, I appeal to tho&s;e who pa&s;s much
of their time in them. And yet, for &s;uch
pa&s;time, married women not only ne|glect
dome&s;tic oeconomy, but even the
education of their children.&mdash;Unhappy
mortals to be thus en&s;laved by a mere
&s;hadow! Their only re&s;ource for their
<PB N="12" REF="21">
children, is a boarding &s;chool; which is
not a little hazardous for girls, who by
their number e&s;cape &s;trict attention; and
who, in the mo&s;t tickli&s;h period of life,
are more apt to follow bad example than
good. Young ladies of rank, carried
from the boarding &s;chool to the di&s;&s;ipa|tion
of high life, are not likely to be|have
better than their mothers did before
them. The fruits of &s;uch education are
but too apparent. Formerly, neither di|vorce
nor &s;eparation were much heard
of: they have now become &s;o frequent,
as &s;carce to make a figure in a news|paper.
A young woman engaged in affec|tion
to a lover, is forced by her parents
into what is termed a more advantage|ous
match. Nature prevailing over con|&s;cience,
&s;he yields to her lover again&s;t her
duty. That mi&s;erable woman is &s;urely
entitled to &s;ome &s;hare of pity; but a lady
who lives always in public, &s;eldom has
that excu&s;e for de&s;erting her hu&s;band.
<PB N="13" REF="22">
Genuine love is a tender plant that can|not
even take root in a crowd; for if an
impre&s;&s;ion be made, it is bani&s;hed by the
next new face. Young women in high
life are married at the will of their pa|rents,
without any per&s;onal attachment;
and if one of them go a&s;tray, &s;he has not
love for an excu&s;e, but downright appe|tite
for variety. It would not, I &s;u&s;pect,
be difficult to find &s;uch a woman, who
would prefer her hu&s;band before her gal|lant,
were they equally new to her. Oh!
Babylon, Babylon, the terror of nations,
but the &s;ink of iniquity.</P>
<P>BIDDING adieu to &s;uch per&s;ons as irre|claimable,
I cannot de&s;pair of a reforma|tion
in the more &s;ober part of the female
&s;ex, if the importance of cultivating the
heart of their children be &s;et in a clear
view. My expectations are the more
&s;anguine, from my acquaintance with &s;e|veral
women of di&s;tinction, who con&s;ider
<PB N="14" REF="23">
the education of their children as their
deare&s;t concern, and who take great
delight in it. One lady there is of high
rank, whom I dare not name, being a|fraid
of di&s;plea&s;ing her. I &s;hould other|ways
propo&s;e her as a pattern, not merely
for imitation, but for emulation: to ex|cel
her, in&s;tead of pain, would give her
&s;atisfaction. I cannot readily form a
wi&s;h more beneficial to my fellow citi|zens,
than that her talent for educating
children &s;hould become general, and that
every mother &s;hould be in&s;pired with her
zeal and per&s;everance in the exerci&s;e of
that talent.</P>
<P>IT appears unaccountable, that our
teachers generally have directed their in|&s;tructions
to the head, with very little at|tention
to the heart. From Ari&s;totle
down to Locke, books without number
have been compo&s;ed for cultivating and
improving the under&s;tanding: few in
<PB N="15" REF="24">
proportion for cultivating and improving
the affections. Yet &s;urely, as man is in|tended
to be more an active than a con|templative
being, the educating a young
man to behave properly in &s;ociety, is of
&s;till greater importance than to make him
even a Solomon for knowledge. Locke
has broached the &s;ubject, and Rou&s;&s;eau
has furni&s;hed many ingenious hints. The
following Loo&s;e Thoughts on the &s;ame
&s;ubject, are what have occurred to me
occa&s;ionally.</P>
<P>GOOD education may be illu&s;trated
by comparing it with its oppo&s;ite. The
following account is given by Le Brun
of tho&s;e kings of Per&s;ia who have inhe|rited
by blood. &startq;This king is ab&s;olute
in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e; for he di&s;po&s;es
of the lives and properties of his &s;ub|jects
without control. He is born in
the &s;eraglio, and kept there in pri&s;on,
ignorant of what pa&s;&s;es in the world.
<PB N="16" REF="25">
When arrived at a certain age, he is
taught to read and write by a black
eunuch, is in&s;tructed in the Maho|metan
faith, and to bear an impla|cable
hatred to the Mahometans of
Turkey and of Indo&s;tan; but not a
&s;yllable of hi&s;tory, of politics, nor even
of morality. Far from being tea&s;ed
with things that require application,
he is &s;et loo&s;e to &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure the
moment the impul&s;e takes him. Opium
is procured for him, and other drugs
that excite voluptuou&s;ne&s;s. At the
death of his predece&s;&s;or, he is led
from his pri&s;on to the throne, where
all pro&s;trate them&s;elves before him,
with expre&s;&s;ions of the mo&s;t abject &s;er|vility.
Surpri&s;ed, nay &s;tupified, with
a &s;cene &s;o new and extraordinary, he
conceives all to be a dream; and it re|quires
time to render the &s;cene fami|liar.
As he is incapable of in&s;piring
affection or even good will, his cour|tiers
<PB N="17" REF="26">
have no view but to make a pro|perty
of him. Far from offering him
good advice, they keep him ignorant in
order to mi&s;lead him. Thus the Per&s;ian
kings pa&s;s their vigour in luxury and
voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, without the lea&s;t regard
to their people or to their own repu|tation.&endq;
Carneades the philo&s;opher ob|&s;erved,
&startq;that the &s;ons of princes learn
nothing to purpo&s;e but to ride the great
hor&s;e; that in other exerci&s;es every one

No &s;ooner is he in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, than he &s;ets loo&s;e all his appetites in pur&s;uit of plea&s;ure. After a few years of gratification, his enjoyments by familiarity and ea&s;ine&s;s of attainment become languid, and at length perfectly in&s;ipid. In the mean time, a total neglect of oeconomy reduces him to &s;traits, his debts multiply and become urgent; and he is in the highe&s;t flow of di&s;&s;ipation when his enjoyments are at the lowe&s;t ebb. Di&s;&s;imulation now &s;upplants the native can|dour of his temper. He mu&s;t promi&s;e when he knows he cannot perform, and mu&s;t care&s;s a dun who is his aver&s;ion.

FEW articles concerning government
are of greater importance, than good edu|cation.
<PB N="21" REF="30">
Our moral duties are circum|&s;cribed
within preci&s;e bounds; and there|fore,
may be objects of law. But man|ners,
depending on an endle&s;s variety of
circum&s;tances, are too complex for law;
and yet upon manners chiefly depends
the well-being of &s;ociety. This matter
was well under&s;tood among the ancient
Romans. Out of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable
citizens were elected cen&s;ors, who&s;e pro|vince
it was to watch over the manners
of the people, to di&s;tingui&s;h the de&s;erving
by &s;uitable rewards, and to brand with
infamy every gro&s;s tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. But in
an opulent nation, it is vain to think of
&s;temming the tide of corruption. To
give vigour to the cen&s;orian office, it in|di&s;pen&s;ably
mu&s;t be exerci&s;ed by men of
dignity, eminent for patrioti&s;m, and of a
character above exception. But as &s;uch
men were not to be found among the
degenerate Romans, the office vani&s;hed,
and has not been revived in any mo|dern
<PB N="22" REF="31">
government: nor, indeed, does there
exi&s;t any government &s;o pure, as to ad|mit
that delicate in&s;titution. Our only
re&s;ource for exerci&s;ing that important of|fice,
are fathers and mothers. Let it
&s;ink into their hearts, that we have no
reliance but upon them for preventing
univer&s;al corruption, and of cour&s;e di&s;|&s;olution
of the &s;tate. It might, indeed,
have been expected, that the parental
cen&s;orian office would be protected and
encouraged by people in power. Though
the legi&s;lature can do little, the Sove|reign
and his mini&s;ters may do much,
both by example and precept. It is in
their power to bring dome&s;tic di&s;cipline
into reputation, which would excite pa|rents
to redouble their diligence. Much
need, alas! is there for &s;ome &s;uch exer|tion,
con&s;idering the defective &s;tate of
education in this i&s;land. So little notion
have the generality of its importance, that
if a young heir get but a &s;mattering of
<PB N="23" REF="32">
Latin or of French, he is held to be an
accompli&s;hed gentleman, qualified for
making a figure. What if a per&s;on who
hath carefully bred up a family, and ad|ded
to the &s;ociety a number of virtuous
citizens, male and female, &s;hould be di|&s;tingui&s;hed
by &s;ome mark of honour,
which, at the &s;ame time, would add lu&s;tre
to every individual of the family? What
if men of genius were encouraged by
&s;uitable rewards to give us good &s;y|&s;tems
of education? When a man has
taught a public &s;chool for 12 or 15 years
with &s;ucce&s;s and applau&s;e, why not re|lieve
him from his fatique by a hand|&s;ome

<P>IT is of the utmo&s;t importance to the

that young men who may &s;erve in par|liament

in particular, be fairly initiated in the
&s;cience of politics. Were the members,

that &s;cience, there would be no &s;uch wo|ful
divi&s;ion among them as at pre&s;ent.
A clear &s;ight of the public good, would
at lea&s;t damp the vile appetite for the
loaves and fi&s;hes that governs many of
them. If they could not entirely approve
the conduct of the mini&s;ter, for what
mini&s;ter is always right in the popular
opinion, they would admoni&s;h him in an
amicable manner; and if they could not
prevail, would wait patiently for a more
favourable opportunity to &s;erve their
country. This, indeed, would be patri|oti&s;m,
of which the di&s;contented party
endeavour in vain to put on the ma&s;k.
It is believed, that the late Sir Robert
Walpole be&s;towed great &s;ums upon wri|ters,
for ju&s;tifying his mea&s;ures. It
would be a more &s;olid plan, to engage
<PB N="25" REF="34">
tutors of colleges and other teachers, to
in&s;til into their pupils a due &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to
government, and to teach them this u&s;e|ful

a factious oppo&s;ition to him. Why not
&s;chools for teaching the &s;cience of poli|tics,
erected at the expence of the public,
as &s;chools are for teaching the art of war?

do honour to my favourite author.
&startq;The &s;ub&s;tance of the brain is in chil|dren
&s;oft and tender; but it hardens
every day. By this &s;oftne&s;s, every thing
is ea&s;ily imprinted on it. It is not
only &s;oft but moi&s;t, which being join|ed
with a great heat, give the child a
continual inclination to move, whence
<PB N="28" REF="37">
proceeds the agitation of children, who
are no more able to fix their mind on
any one object, than their body in any
one place. The fir&s;t images, engraven
while the brain is &s;oft, are the deepe&s;t,
and harden as age dries the brain, and
con&s;equently become indefaceable by
time. Hence it is, that when old, we
remember many things done in youth,
and not what were done in riper age;
becau&s;e the brain at that age is dried
and filled with other images. But if
in childhood, the brain be adapted for
receiving images, it is not altogether
&s;o for the regular di&s;po&s;al of them, or
for rea&s;oning. For though the moi&s;ture
of the brain renders the impre&s;&s;ions
ea&s;y, yet, by being joined with too
great a heat, it makes a &s;ort of agita|tion
which breaks the &s;eries of rational
deductions.&endq; What a rant is this; worlds
without any meaning! Here, man is re|duced
to be a mere machine, every thing
<PB N="29" REF="38">
explained from &s;oft and hard, moi&s;t and
dry, hot and cold; cau&s;es that have no
imaginable connection with the effects
endeavoured to be explained. Books of
this kind may be pored on without end,
and the reader be not a jot the wi&s;er.
Why from the &s;ame principles does not
this mo&s;t profound philo&s;opher deduce
the light of the &s;un, the circulation of the
blood; or, what is no le&s;s difficult, the
mathematical regularity of an egg?</P>

<P>THE faculty of rea&s;on is be&s;towed
on man for controling his appetites
and pa&s;&s;ions, and for giving them a pro|per
direction. This faculty is indeed
born with us; but as it is feeble like the
body during the fir&s;t &s;tage of life, pa|rental
authority &s;upplies the want of rea|&s;on
during that period. And, as no work
of God is left imperfect, children are
directed by in&s;tinct to obey their pa|rents;
and if children be not unkindly
treated, their obedience is not only vo|luntary,
but affectionate. This is not a
picture of imagination: every one who
has given attention to the infant &s;tate,
will bear witne&s;s, that a child clings to its
<PB N="32" REF="40">
mother, and is fonder of her than of all
the world be&s;ide. By this admirable plan,
children, who have no rea&s;on, are com|monly
better governed, than adult per|&s;ons
who po&s;&s;e&s;s a con&s;iderable &s;hare of
it: the former are entirely ob&s;equious to
the rea&s;on of another; the latter not al|ways
to their own.</P>
<P>THAT the authority of parents mu&s;t
be ab&s;olute, is evident, becau&s;e in the
nature of things it cannot be &s;ubject to
any control. And it is equally evident,
that the &s;ame authority mu&s;t be tran&s;|ferred
to the keeper, where the parents
are dead or at a di&s;tance. But much art
and delicacy are requi&s;ite in the manner
of exerci&s;ing it. I ab&s;olutely prohibit &s;e|verity;
which will terrify the child and
reduce it to di&s;&s;imulation, the wor&s;t of
habits. If &s;uch &s;everity be exerci&s;ed as
to alienate the child's affection, there is
an end to education; the parent or keeper
<PB N="33" REF="41">
is transformed into a cruel tyrant over
a trembling &s;lave. Beware on the other
hand of bewraying any unea&s;ine&s;s in re|fu&s;ing
what a child calls for unrea&s;on|ably:
perceiving your unea&s;ine&s;s, it will
renew its attempt, hoping to find you in
better humour. Even infants, &s;ome at
lea&s;t, are capable of this artifice. There|fore,
if an infant explain by &s;igns what
it ought to have, let it be gratified-in|&s;tantly
with a cheerful countenance. If
it de&s;ire what it ought not to have, let
the refu&s;al be &s;edate, but firm. Regard
not its crying: it will &s;oon give over, if
not li&s;tened to. The ta&s;k is ea&s;ier with
a child who under&s;tands what is &s;aid to
it: &s;ay only with a firm tone, that it can|not
have what it de&s;ires; but without
&s;hewing any heat on the one hand, or
concern on the other. The child, be|lieving
that the thing is impo&s;&s;ible, will
cea&s;e to fret. Some children begin early
to &s;how a keenne&s;s for what touches their
<PB N="34" REF="42">
fancy. Lo&s;e not a moment to repre&s;s
that keenne&s;s, not by bluntne&s;s or rough|ne&s;s,
but by informing the child that it
is improper. If from infancy it have
been trained to obedience, it will &s;ubmit
plea&s;antly. The effect of this di&s;cipline
is not confined to childhood: it is an
excellent preparation for bearing cro&s;&s;es
and di&s;appointments in all the &s;tages of
life. How differently do the low people
manage their children? If a child cry
without rea&s;on, it is whipt by the angry
mother; and it has now rea&s;on to cry,
which it does till its little heart is like to
break. The mother, &s;till through the
influence of pa&s;&s;ion, though of a differ|ent
kind, melts into pity, cajoles, flatters,
care&s;&s;es, all to pacify the poor infant.
Can any thing be more prepo&s;terous?
The child &s;oon di&s;covers that fretting
and crying will procure what it wants.
As few of the lower &s;ort ever think of
di&s;ciplining their children to obedience,
<PB N="35" REF="43">
it is no wonder that there is found a|mong
them &s;o much ob&s;tinacy and per|ver&s;ene&s;s.</P>
<P>THE ab&s;olute dependence on parents
that nature puts children under, has,
when rightly exerci&s;ed, two effects ex|tremely
&s;alutary. One is, that it produ|ces
a habit of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to authority, a
fine preparation for the &s;ocial life. The
authority of the magi&s;trate &s;ucceeds to
that of the parent; and the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion
paid to the latter is readily transferred
to the former. The great empire of
China affords a con&s;picuous in&s;tance:
reverence to parents is the corner-&s;tone
of that va&s;t edifice: it is encouraged
as the highe&s;t virtue; and every neglect
meets di&s;grace and puni&s;hment. Another
effect is, that the habit of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to
parental authority introduces naturally a
habit of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to &s;elf-authority, or,
in other words, a habit of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to
<PB N="36" REF="44">
the authority of con&s;cience. Youth is
liable to the &s;eduction of pa&s;&s;ion, and a
dangerous period it is to tho&s;e who have
been neglected in childhood. But a young
man, obedient from infancy to his pa|rents,
&s;ubmits with as little he&s;itation to
the dictates of his own con&s;cience; and if
happily, at his entrance into public life, he
e&s;cape temptations that are difficult to be
re&s;i&s;ted, he becomes fortified by habit to
re&s;i&s;t every temptation.</P>
<P>THOUGH parental authority well tem|pered
fits us thus for &s;ociety and happi|ne&s;s,
yet that eminent writer Rou&s;&s;eau,
rejecting the &s;y&s;tem of nature, declares
for emancipating children from all &s;ub|jection,
indulging them in every fancy,
provided only they do no mi&s;chief to
others. I cannot really conjecture, upon
what imagined principle in human na|ture
this doctrine is founded. A child
is incapable to judge for it&s;elf; and yet
<PB N="37" REF="45">
it mu&s;t not be directed by its parents.
&startq;Pray Sir, hold off, there ought to be
no authority, the child mu&s;t be left to
it&s;elf.&endq; This is a &s;trange notion. Can
it be improper to tell a child, that what it
de&s;ires is wrong; or that the doing what it
de&s;ires would make it de&s;pi&s;ed or hated?
If the child be not &s;o far advanced as to
under&s;tand that language, nothing re|mains
but plain authority, which the
child &s;ubmits to readily and plea&s;antly.
Rou&s;&s;eau maintains, that you mu&s;t not
pretend to have any authority over
your pupil, but only that you are the
&s;tronger, and can &s;ubject him by force<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Emile, vol. I. p. 95.</NOTE>.
Is not this to teach him, that right de|pends
on force; and that he may law|fully
&s;ubject every one who is weaker
than him&s;elf? Was it Rou&s;&s;eau's inten|tion
to breed his pupil a tyrant and
oppre&s;&s;or? he could not take a more ef|fectual
method.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="46">
AN infallible way of rendering a child
unhappy, is to indulge it in all its de|mands.
Its de&s;ires multiply by gratifica|tion;
without every re&s;ting &s;atisfied: it
is lucky for the indulgent parents, if it
demand not the moon for a play-thing.
You cannot give every thing; and your
refu&s;al di&s;tre&s;&s;es the creature more, than
if you had &s;topt &s;hort at fir&s;t. A child
in pain is entitled to great indulgence;
but beware of yielding to fancy: the
more the child is indulged, the more
head&s;trong it grows: and the more im|patient
of a di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>I AM acquainted with a very re&s;pec|table
couple, di&s;ciples of Rou&s;&s;eau; more
however, I conjecture, from inclination
than from conviction. They &s;eldom hi|therto
have employed any means for
keeping their children in order, but pro|mi&s;es
and intreaties. As the father was
playing at che&s;s with a friend, one of his
<PB N="39" REF="47">
children, a boy of about four years, took
a piece from the board and away to play
with it. Harry, &s;ays the father, let us
have back the man, and there's an apple
for you. The apple was &s;oon devoured,
and another che&s;s-man laid hold of. In
&s;hort, they were obliged to &s;u&s;pend the
game, till the boy, turning hungry, was
led away to &s;upper. I would have &s;uch
parents con&s;ider, whether they are not
here mi&s;led by &s;elf-deceit. Their motive
they imagine to be tenderne&s;s for the
poor babes. But the real motive is their
own weakne&s;s, which they indulge at the
expence of their babes; for mu&s;t it not
even to them be evident, that to indulge
irregular fancies in creatures de&s;titute of
rea&s;on, is de&s;tructive to &s;elf-command,
without which there can be no virtue.
It perhaps will be ob&s;erved, that this ca&s;e
falls not under the general rule, being an
in&s;tance of a child by its petulance hurt|ing
others. If &s;o, what is laid down as
<PB N="40" REF="48">
a general rule, mu&s;t be contracted with|in
a narrower compa&s;s. But, letting that
pa&s;s, what would our author have &s;aid
upon the following ca&s;e. A gentleman,
upon a vi&s;it at a friend's hou&s;e, heard
little ma&s;ter crying below &s;tairs. The
mother alarmed was told, that he wanted
to ride up to table upon the roa&s;t beef,
and that the cook did not reli&s;h the pro|ject.
The mother was for letting Dickie
have his will. But the father luckily
reflected, that the &s;irloin would probably

would have made this al&s;o an exception,
as he could not mean, that parents &s;hould
&s;tand by and &s;uffer their children to hurt
them&s;elves. His doctrine thus reformed,
re&s;olves in giving children full liberty in
matters indifferent, &s;uch as can neither
hurt them&s;elves nor others; to which
re&s;triction I willingly &s;ub&s;cribe. And
thus a doctrine u&s;hered in with &s;olem|nity
as a leading principle in the educa|tion

<HEAD TYPE="sub">MANAGEMENT of CHILDREN in the
Fir&s;t Stage of Life.</HEAD>
<P>IN a complete treati&s;e upon the educa|tion
of children, every principle, every
in&s;tinct, every pa&s;&s;ion and every appetite
ought to be carefully di&s;&s;ected. But this
is far beyond my purpo&s;e, and I believe
beyond my reach. I venture only to
give in&s;tructions upon &s;uch of the parti|culars
above mentioned as di&s;play them|&s;elves
early, and make &s;ome figure even
in childhood. A fair commencement of
a &s;ubject, mo&s;tly new, is all I pretend to.
May I not indulge the plea&s;ing hope that
a &s;ubject of &s;o great importance will be
ripened by others, and perhaps brought
to perfection by the able&s;t hands. The
following in&s;tructions belong to the pre|&s;ent
&s;ection.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="51">
<HI>1&s;t,</HI> A POWER to recal at will plea&s;ing
objects, would be a greater ble&s;&s;ing than
ever was be&s;towed in a fairy tale. The
plea&s;ure of heal this little felt, except in
its ab&s;ence: it is however a real ble&s;&s;ing;
not only as it guards again&s;t pain, but
as it naturally &s;ugge&s;ts plea&s;ing objects.
In the latter re&s;pect, however, it is infe|rior
to cheerfulne&s;s and &s;weetne&s;s of
temper; which are not only in them|&s;elves
plea&s;ant, but &s;till more by direc|ting
the mind to none but agreeable ob|jects.
A &s;ullen and moro&s;e temper, on
the contrary, is not only in it&s;elf un|plea&s;ant,
but &s;till more by calling to
mind no objects but what are di&s;agree|able.</P>
<P>THIS ob&s;ervation may be turned to
good account in education. Do we wi&s;h
to make our children happy? Let them
be accu&s;tomed to agreeable objects, and
a veil drawn over tho&s;e that are di&s;|agreeable.
<PB N="44" REF="52">
Cheerfulne&s;s and agreeable
objects, have a mutual influence: the
former attracts the latter; and the latter
by reaction invigorate the former. Can
any one doubt, that fettering infants
new born in folds of linen, which they
&s;truggle again&s;t in vain, mu&s;t have an
effect upon their temper? Were that
treatment long continued, it would pro|duce
a la&s;ting habit of fretfulne&s;s. This,
among other objections to the practice,
is of great weight. Why &s;hould not the
children of people in ea&s;y circum&s;tances,
be rou&s;ed from &s;leep every morning with
mu&s;ic? Why not be entertained fre|quently
with agreeable pictures; and
why not be amu&s;ed with ludicrous &s;to|ries
to make them laugh? I would how|ever
be far from excluding &s;ubjects that
excite pity and tender concern. Pity is
indeed painful; but far from di&s;agree|able,
even in the actual feeling. I am
plea&s;ed with my&s;elf for having &s;ympa|thized
<PB N="45" REF="53">
with another; and that plea&s;ing
reflection adds to my happine&s;s.</P>
<P>AGREEABLE impre&s;&s;ions may be made
upon an infant even in its mother's
womb. The mother during pregnancy
ought to bani&s;h all di&s;mal thoughts, and
pre&s;erve her&s;elf as much as po&s;&s;ible calm
and cheerful. There is little doubt but
that this will benefit her infant. The
&s;ame rea&s;on holds for chu&s;ing a nur&s;e or
keeper of an even and cheerful temper.</P>
<P>A HABIT of cheerfulne&s;s acquired in
infancy, contributes not a little to health.
The Druids of old were eminently &s;killed
in phy&s;ic. Their chief <HI>recipe</HI> for pre&s;er|ving
health was expre&s;&s;ed in three words,
<HI>cheerfulne&s;s, temperance, exerci&s;e.</HI> This ha|bit
contributes not le&s;s to alleviate mi&s;|fortunes.
It makes us &s;ee every ob|ject
in its be&s;t light, and fits us to
&s;ubmit to accidents without repining.
<PB N="46" REF="54">
&startq;Almo&s;t every object that attracts our
notice, has its bright and its dark
&s;ide: he that habituates him&s;elf to
look at the dark &s;ide, will &s;our his di&s;|po&s;ition,
and con&s;equently impair his
happine&s;s; while he who con&s;tantly
beholds the bright &s;ide, in&s;en&s;ibly me|liorates
his temper, and, in con&s;equence
of it, improves his own happine&s;s, and
the happine&s;s of all about him.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">THE WORLD, No. 126.</NOTE>&endq;</P>
<P><HI>2d,</HI> WILL I be thought to refine too
much when I maintain, that a habit of
cheerfulne&s;s acquired during infancy,
will contribute to make a face beautiful?
A &s;avage mind produces &s;avage manners;
and the&s;e in conjunction produce a har&s;h
and rugged countenance. Hence it is
that a national face improves gradually,
with the manners of the people. Li&s;ten
to this ye mothers, with re&s;pect e&s;pecially
to your female children: you will find
<PB N="47" REF="55">
that cheerfulne&s;s is a greater beautifier
than the fine&s;t pearl powder.</P>
<P>SOME children are by nature ra&s;h and
impetuous: a much greater number are
&s;hy and timid. The di&s;po&s;ition of a
child appears early; and both extremes
ought to be corrected whenever an op|portunity
occurs. Fear is a pa&s;&s;ion im|planted
in our nature to warn us of dan|ger,
in order to guard again&s;t it. When
moderate &s;o as to rai&s;e our activity only,
without overwhelming us, it is a mo&s;t
&s;alutary pa&s;&s;ion: but when it &s;wells to
exce&s;s, which it is apt to do in a timid
di&s;po&s;ition, far from contributing to &s;afe|ty,
it &s;tupifies the man, and renders him
incapable of action. If your pupil there|fore
be of a fearful temper, you cannot
begin too early to fortify him again&s;t
that weakne&s;s. Mo&s;t children are afraid
of a new object that is formidable in its
appearance, a large dog for example.
<PB N="48" REF="56">
Handle it familiarly and &s;how it to be
harmle&s;s: the child will be per&s;uaded to
do the &s;ame. A child, as Rou&s;&s;eau ob|&s;erves,
is afraid of a ma&s;k. Begin with
&s;howing it an agreeable ma&s;k: put it on
laughing; others laugh, and the child
laughs. Accu&s;tom the child to ma&s;ks
le&s;s and le&s;s agreeable: it will in time be
afraid of no ma&s;k, however ugly. Thun|der
has an awful &s;ound, and is apt to
rai&s;e fear. Lead your pupil to the fields
when it thunders: it will in time cea&s;e
to fear. Guard your children with un|remitting
care again&s;t tales of gho&s;ts and
hobgoblins, which in childhood make a
deep impre&s;&s;ion. As &s;uch tales are al|ways
connected with darkne&s;s, accu&s;tom
your children to grope their way in the
dark. Rou&s;&s;eau's method of teaching
children to act in the dark, de&s;erves to
be imitated. I was told by a lady of
rank, that by engaging her &s;ervants to
follow her example, &s;uch tales were un|known
<PB N="49" REF="57">
in her family. Her children were
trained to &s;ay their prayers in a dark
room, after receiving the following in|&s;truction,
&startq;Thy Father which &s;eeth in
&s;ecret will reward thee openly.&endq; They
were di&s;ciplined to lay up their-play|things
in &s;uch order, as to find them
readily in the dark.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to the oppo&s;ite extreme
of ra&s;hne&s;s and impetuo&s;ity, lay hold of
every proper opportunity for moderating
it; and there is little doubt of &s;ucce&s;s, if
proper means be u&s;ed. Sometimes even
an accident will a&s;&s;i&s;t: a child happening
to fall down a few &s;teps of a &s;tair, it for
&s;ome time would neither go up nor down
without its maid. There is no occa&s;ion
to warn children again&s;t &s;een danger: no
child is ever di&s;po&s;ed to throw it&s;elf down
from a window, nor to jump into a fierce
running &s;tream. But there are things that
attract the eye by their lu&s;tre, which an
<PB N="50" REF="58">
infant will endeavour to gra&s;p, becau&s;e
it &s;ees no danger; a burning candle for
example, or a &s;hining knife. Teach your
infant to guard again&s;t &s;uch things: put
your hand once or twice on a &s;ilver boil|er
full of hot water, and draw it away
with &s;igns of pain. After putting the in|fant's
hand on it till it feels pain, let it
under&s;tand by &s;igns that the thing ought
not to be touched. This will have its
proper effect, even before the infant can
&s;peak. An infant endeavours to gra&s;p
the blade of a knife, being the &s;hining
part. Cut its finger cunningly till the
blood appear. Let it under&s;tand by &s;igns
that this is done by the knife: it will
avoid a knife till it learn to handle it
without danger. A lady made the ex|periment
on an infant of a year; and it
not only avoided the knife, but looked
concerned when others handled it. At
the age of &s;ix or &s;even, boys, in imitation
of men, will attempt things above their
<PB N="51" REF="59">
&s;trength. In that ca&s;e, it is proper to re|&s;train
them by pointing out the danger.</P>
<P><HI>3d,</HI> CHILDREN are prone to complain,
becau&s;e they have no power to right
them&s;elves. Complaints too readily li|&s;tened
to, will &s;et children of a family at
variance with one another. Di&s;regard a
&s;light complaint, and admoni&s;h the com|plainer,
that it ought to love its brother
or &s;i&s;ter, in&s;tead of bringing it to puni&s;h|ment
by complaining. If the complaint
de&s;erve a hearing, receive it coolly, and
&s;ay that enquiry &s;hall be made. Admo|ni&s;h
the offender privately to give &s;atis|faction,
particularly by in&s;tant re&s;titu|tion,
if it have taken any thing from the
complainer. This way of redre&s;&s;ing
wrongs, in&s;tead of rai&s;ing enmity, may
contribute to cordiality among the chil|dren
of a family.</P>
<P><HI>4th,</HI> IF proper authority be maintain|ed
from the beginning, &s;tubbornne&s;s in a
<PB N="52" REF="60">
child will be a vice unknown; but if laid
a&s;ide or relaxed, &s;tubbornne&s;s &s;oon ap|pears
in &s;ome children. Mr Locke men|tions
a lady who&s;e daughter was nur&s;ed
in the country. She found the child &s;o
&s;tubborn, as to be forced to whip it eight
times before it was &s;ubdued. This was
the fir&s;t and the la&s;t time of laying a
hand upon it. Ever after, it was all com|pliance
and obedience. This ought to
be a le&s;&s;on to parents never to relax the
reins of government. Doubtle&s;s the mo|ther
here &s;uffered more pain than the
child. Con&s;ult Rou&s;&s;eau's method of
&s;ubduing an ob&s;tinate boy<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Emile, vol. I. p. 149.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>5th,</HI> MAN is an imitative being; and
his pronene&s;s to imitation may be made
&s;ub&s;ervient to good culture. A child
under three, &s;hrinks from every grown
per&s;on, except tho&s;e of its acquain|tance.
But it is fond of children. Let
<PB N="53" REF="61">
a child of &s;ix or &s;even, carefully educated,
a&s;&s;ociate with younger children, they will
learn more by imitation than by much
verbal in&s;truction. Even before infants
can &s;peak, they under&s;tand by &s;igns your
di&s;approbation of a fretful per&s;on, or of
one who is dirty or &s;lovenly. But imi|tation
is a two-edged weapon: though
nature dictates to boys and girls different
amu&s;ements, yet nature may be warped
by circum&s;tances. A boy educated with
girls of his own age, will imitate their
manners, and become effeminate. In this
part of the world, it is more common to
&s;ee a girl imitate the manners of the boys
with whom &s;he is educated. Such wrong
bia&s;&s;es ought to be guarded again&s;t. There
are in&s;tances of per&s;ons having contract|ed
a bad manner of &s;peaking, from hear|ing
daily the inarticulate &s;ounds of the
younger part of the family. Nature, in|deed,
directs us to imitate tho&s;e above
us; but a child of &s;ix or &s;even, living
<PB N="54" REF="62">
with &s;everal younger, will de&s;cend to
partake of their amu&s;ements, rather than
be left alone.</P>
<P><HI>6th,</HI> A favourite child, indulged by its
parents to a&s;&s;ume authority over others,
will become a tyrant when grown up.
Some children are di&s;po&s;ed to treat &s;er|vants
with haughtine&s;s and contempt.
If this temper in children be not repre&s;|&s;ed,
they will become like negro-drivers
in our colonies, or our carters at home.
Give authority to your &s;ervants to let
&s;uch children know, that they are not
their &s;ervants, nor owe them obedience.
From this treatment they will di&s;cover,
that civility and intreaty, are the only
means for procuring what they want.</P>
<P><HI>7th,</HI> THAT in the nature of &s;ome in|dividuals,
there is a di&s;po&s;ition to cruelty,
cannot be di&s;gui&s;ed, being evident from
various facts. Strong &s;ymptoms of it ap|pear
<PB N="55" REF="63">
in childhood, during which period
there is nothing hid. It is not uncom|mon
in a child, after care&s;&s;ing its favou|rite
puppy, to kick and beat it; or, after
&s;troking its &s;parrow, to pull off its head.
I have &s;een a little girl, after &s;pending
hours in dre&s;&s;ing its doll, throw it over
the window in a &s;udden fit. This di&s;ea&s;e
is not ea&s;ily cured, becau&s;e, like the King's
evil, it is kept &s;ecret. I know of no cure
&s;o effectual, as to enure a child of this
temper to objects of pity and concern.
Such objects frequently pre&s;ented, and at
proper times, may give a turn to the di|&s;temper,
and make it yield to humanity.
Such fits of cruelty however, are far from
being general. There are many children,
who, having no malice in their compo&s;i|tion,
are invariably kind to their favou|rites,
and charitable to per&s;ons in want.</P>
<P><HI>8th,</HI> IT is a capital point to enure young
per&s;ons to &s;uffer accidental evils with
<PB N="56" REF="64">
firmne&s;s. Children at play, bear &s;trokes,
fatigue, and hunger, without repining;
and cu&s;tom will render &s;uch evils fami|liar
and ea&s;y. This was held an impor|tant
branch of education among the
Spartans; witne&s;s the young man who
&s;uffered a fox he had &s;tolen to eat into
his bowels, rather than di&s;clo&s;e the theft.
The &s;eat of pain is in the mind; and ac|cordingly
bodily di&s;tre&s;s is felt much the
lighter when the mind is prepared for
it. If a child cut its finger or get a bump
on its head by a fall, it &s;oftens the pain
to make a joke of it, to laugh, and to
make the child laugh. If it fall a crying,
&s;ay &startq;that it is below a per&s;on of fa&s;hion
to mind a fall, that no children cry
but beggars brats, and that &s;uch a one
&s;uffered more without complaining.&endq;
Nur&s;es and &s;ervants increa&s;e the child's
di&s;tre&s;s, by an appearance of pity and
concern. Death commonly is very little
painful: the pain lies in the imagination
<PB N="57" REF="65">
of the dying per&s;on, rai&s;ed by the tears
and melancholy looks of the attendants.
Teach a boy to &s;uffer &s;light pain without
concern, and he will become a hero. If
too careful to prevent pain, you render
your child a coward.</P>
<P>THIS branch of education is for the
mo&s;t part ill conducted, e&s;pecially among
the lower ranks. A child, &s;lipping a foot
and falling, cries from fear more than
from pain. It is whipped for crying,
though no antecedent care had been taken
to correct that weakne&s;s. It cries now
bitterly; and every thing mu&s;t be done
to appea&s;e the poor child. The floor is
beat for hurting babie: it gets a &s;ugar-plum
to give over crying. Such treat|ment
inculcates more than one bad le&s;&s;on.
The beating the floor fo&s;ters revenge in
the child. The &s;ugar-plum teaches it to
cry when it wants any thing; and hence
artifice and &s;imulation.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="66">
<HI>9th,</HI> THAT cleanline&s;s proceeds from
an internal &s;en&s;e, is made evident in
Sketches of the hi&s;tory of Man<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Edit. 2. vol. I. p. 320.</NOTE>. This
&s;en&s;e, originally weak, like many others,
is capable of being fortified by education.
Let every thing be clean about your chil|dren:
give &s;igns of di&s;gu&s;t at a dirty
hand or a dirty frock, of which even an
infant before it can &s;peak, will compre|hend
the meaning. I was informed by
a lady, not a little &s;tudious of human na|ture,
that a child of her's, not two years
old, &s;eeing a dirty &s;pot on her frock, cut
it out, knowing no better way of remo|ving
the eye-&s;ore.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">MANAGEMENT of CHILDREN in their
Second Stage.</HEAD>
<P><HI>1&s;t,</HI> HESIOD, a Greek Poet, than
whom we know none more an|tient,
makes the following instructive ob|&s;ervation,
that the gods invented indu|&s;try
in order to make us virtuous. No|thing
indeed equals indu&s;try for prevent|ing
vice. Parents and tutors! apply this
ob&s;ervation to the children under your
care. Keep them employed, keep them
bu&s;y, and they will never have a wrong
thought. Let them indulge them&s;elves
in play as long as they incline; but draw
them off when they begin to tire. Train
them to do every thing for them&s;elves
as much as po&s;&s;ible; which will not only
promote their activity, but excite their
invention. Children who have every
<PB N="60" REF="68">
thing furni&s;hed to them without labour
or thought on their part, will become in|dolent
and incapable of any vigorous
exertion,&mdash;helple&s;s beings who mu&s;t em|ploy
another hand even to buckle a &s;hoe.
In order to exerci&s;e invention, children
&s;hould have no play-things but what they
make them&s;elves, or help to make. A
play-thing that gratifies the fight only,
is not long reli&s;hed; but a child never
tires of one that gives it exerci&s;e. A girl
continues fond of her doll, being con&s;tant|ly
employed in dre&s;&s;ing and undre&s;&s;ing it.
She makes it act the vi&s;itor in the draw|ing-room:
&s;he makes it do the honours of
the table: &s;he gives it correction and in|&s;truction.
Such things you will &s;ee imitat|ed
by a girl even in her fourth year. I
know not that there has been invented any
&s;uch play-thing for a boy of the &s;ame age.
A bow and arrows require more years;
and &s;o does the art of walking blindfold
in a &s;treight line, or of &s;earching for any
<PB N="61" REF="69">
thing in the dark. Running for a prize
is an exerci&s;e too violent for boys of
twice that age. Riding on a &s;tick is
&s;o faint an imitation of riding on hor&s;e|back,
as not to be long reli&s;hed. For
want of &s;uitable play-things, employ
them in matters that require &s;ome
thought. Send your &s;on to bring you
the ripe&s;t apple in the garden, or the
number of fruit-trees that cover the
walls, or of hor&s;es in a certain inclo&s;ure.
Send him to borrow for you &s;uch a
book; or to make your apology for
breaking an appointment. Hide a pen|knife
in a &s;critore: Send him to bring
it. If un&s;ucce&s;sful, &s;end him again, and
he finds it at la&s;t. This will exerci&s;e
both his indu&s;try and invention. Set
things before him for a choice, a picture-book,
a pair of gloves, &s;ilver buckles, a
child's bow and arrows. Demand a
rea&s;on for his choice, which will give
you occa&s;ion to in&s;truct him about a
<PB N="62" REF="70">
right choice. Employ your daughter the
&s;ame way, e&s;pecially in matters that be|long
more properly to her &s;ex. I am told,
that there is an Engli&s;h boarding &s;chool,
in which the girls have gardening for an
amu&s;ement. A certain &s;pot is allotted to
each, which &s;he fills with flowers, and
weeds with a hoe accommodated to her
&s;ize.</P>
<P>THERE are other exerci&s;es fitted for
boys as well as girls, which I introduce
here for the &s;ake of connection, though
perhaps the next &s;ection may be thought
a more proper place for them. To ini|tiate
children in the knowledge of trees,
of fruit, and of their names, take a leaf
from each of the common kinds, an oak,
a beech, an elm, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Spread them on a
table, and point out to your pupils the
particulars that difference each of them
from the re&s;t. Add from time to time
leaves of trees le&s;s common. Your pupils
<PB N="63" REF="71">
will learn to know every tree at fir&s;t &s;ight
by its leaf. This is a fine introduction
to botany, and a promoter of it. An a|pricot,
a peach, a nectarine, are readily di|stingui&s;hable;
but to di&s;tingui&s;h the dif|ferent
kinds of apples and of pears, and
to give names to each, requires more la|bour
than commonly is given. And this
may be made an amu&s;ement even for
children of four or five. Show them the
different kinds, and point out the peculi|arities
of &s;hape and colour. The young
creatures will be fond of this exerci&s;e,
and will &s;oon be expert in it. Such ex|erci&s;es
have the double advantage of &s;er|ving
for in&s;truction as well as for pa&s;s|time.
Another amu&s;ement will &s;erve as
an early introduction to hi&s;tory. Collect
prints of eminent per&s;ons, antient and
modern. After examining a print with
attention, give a &s;hort account of the
per&s;on it repre&s;ents, Epaminondas for
example, who delivered his country from
<PB N="64" REF="72">
Spartan oppre&s;&s;ion, or Julius Cae&s;ar, who
en&s;laved his country. Proceed at inter|vals
to other prints, with proper ob&s;erva|tions
for improving your pupils in vir|tuous
principles, and for giving them a
di&s;ta&s;te to vice. When &s;ufficiently ripe, let
them take the lead, and one after another,
name the per&s;ons and their hi&s;tory who
are repre&s;ented in the prints. Entering
into a cour&s;e of hi&s;tory in more advanced
years, they will have double plea&s;ure
in renewing their acquaintance with the
per&s;ons who make the chief figure.</P>
<P>INDUSTRY produces many other good
effects. In the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place, an indu&s;trious
per&s;on is always in good humour. La|bouring
people never tire, becau&s;e they
have always &s;omething to do. To lan|gui&s;h
for want of occupation, is the en|vied
lot of the opulent; their amu&s;e|ments
by familiarity &s;oon turning infi|pid.
Women of fortune having nothing
<PB N="65" REF="73">
to animate them after the vanities of
youth are over, become vapouri&s;h and
unhappy. In the <HI>next</HI> place, a habit
of application paves the way finely for
&s;chools and colleges; and makes it ea&s;y
to acquire every &s;ort of knowledge. No|thing
on the other hand is more baneful,
than a habit of &s;auntering. This is ea&s;ily
prevented in children, becau&s;e they are
naturally active; but with difficulty after
the habit is begun. The neglect of this
material article, has proved the ruin of
many a hopeful genius: it is little le&s;s
faulty, than the indulging of young per|sons
in vicious habits; for idlene&s;s is an
inlet to many vices.</P>
<P>ROUSSEAU declares again&s;t impo&s;ing
ta&s;ks on children. I cannot help differ|ing.
Children are fond to be employed.
Let their ta&s;ks at fir&s;t be agreeable, and
much within their ability; time and ha|bit
will enable them to overcome the
<PB N="66" REF="74">
mo&s;t difficult. This &s;ort of culture, is at
any rate nece&s;&s;ary for preparing a young
man to learn a trade. How indocile in
the hand of a ma&s;ter mu&s;t the apprentice
be, who has always been permitted to act
without re&s;traint!</P>
<P><HI>2d,</HI> WHAT comes next in order, is to
promote every virtue in your children,
of which benevolence is the capital. The
man who is fond of his own &s;weet per|&s;on,
and of his own little plea&s;ures, has
no reli&s;h of benevolence, nor money to
&s;pare upon others. On the other hand,
he who &s;pares upon him&s;elf, is common|ly
liberal to tho&s;e he is connected with.
Pliny the younger was famous for doing
good. He paid the debts of one, portion|ed
the daughter of another, gave his nur&s;e
a bit of land for her &s;u&s;tenance, made an
e&s;tabli&s;hment for orphans and poor chil|dren,&mdash;all
upon a very moderate income.
To one curious to know the fund that
<PB N="67" REF="75">
&s;upported &s;o much expence, he an&s;wered
&s;imply, &startq;What is wanting of yearly rent
is &s;upplied by frugality.&endq; The late
Earl of Elgin permitted his two &s;ons in
their hours of play, to a&s;&s;ociate with boys
in the neighbourhood, which he thought
better, than to expo&s;e them to be corrupt|ed
at home by his &s;ervants, filling them
with notions of their rank and quality.
One day, the two boys being called to
dinner, a young lad, their companion,
&s;aid, &startq;I'll wait till you return, as there
is no dinner for me at home. Have
you no money to buy it? No. Come
then and dine with us. No.&endq; &startq;Papa,&endq;
&s;ays the elde&s;t, &startq;what was the price of
the &s;ilver buckles you gave me? Five
&s;hillings. Let me have them, and I'll
give you the buckles.&endq; It was done
accordingly. The Earl, enquiring pri|vately,
found that the money was given
to the lad. The buckles were returned,
and the boy was highly commended for
<PB N="68" REF="76">
being kind to his companion. A crowd
of boys, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the grammar
&s;chool on a Saturday, attacked a beggar
who was in liquor, pelting him with dirt
and &s;tones for their diver&s;ion. One only
there was, who did every thing to make
his companions de&s;i&s;t. He applied to a
woman who kept a &s;tall hard by, offer|ing
all the money he had, if &s;he would
re&s;cue the poor creature. The woman,
admiring the boy's humanity, told the
&s;tory to his mother's cook, from whom
it a&s;cended to the parlour. The mother
was delighted: but the boy, afraid that
his companions would hold him in deri|&s;ion
for &s;uch weakne&s;s, threatned revenge
again&s;t the woman. The mother laid
hold of the opportunity to convince her
&s;on, that it was &s;hameful to abu&s;e a poor
creature who could not defend him&s;elf;
and that the lads would be cha&s;ti&s;ed by
their parents, for doing a thing &s;o un|worthy
of gentlemen; exhorting him to
<PB N="69" REF="77">
per&s;evere in what was right, without re|garding
his companions. A boy about
the age of ten, &s;ays to his father, &startq;Papa,
give me &s;ome money. There is a &s;hil|ling,
will that do? No.&endq; &startq;There's a
guinea. Thank you papa.&endq; The gen|tleman
di&s;covered, that it was given to a
woman who had been delivered of twins,
and was obliged to hire a nur&s;e for one
of them. A boy of five years, ob&s;erving
that a gentleman playing at cards did not
pay what he lo&s;t, and concluding that he
had no money, begged &s;ome from his fa|ther
to give to the gentleman. A boy
between &s;even and eight, of a noble fami|ly,
&s;trayed accidentally into a hut where
he &s;aw a poor woman with a &s;ick child
on her knee. Struck with compa&s;&s;ion, he
in&s;tantly gave her all the money he had;
carried to her from the herb market,
turnips and potatoes, with bread and
&s;craps from his father's kitchen. The
parents enchanted with their &s;on, took
<PB N="70" REF="78">
the poor family off his hand. Two or
three years after, he &s;aved the whole of
his weekly allowance, till it amounted to
eleven or twelve &s;hillings, and purcha&s;ed
a Latin dictionary, which he &s;ent to a
comerade of his at the grammar &s;chool.
Many other acts of goodne&s;s are record|ed
of this boy in the family. Can there
be conceived a misfortune that will &s;ink
deeper into the heart of affectionate pa|rents,
than the death of &s;uch a child?
It wrings my heart to think of it.</P>
<Q><L>O&s;tendent terris hunc tantum fata, neque ultra</L>
<L>E&s;&s;e &s;inent.</L>

<P>THERE is no branch of education more
neglected than the training of young per|&s;ons
to be charitable. And yet were this
virtue in&s;tilled into children, &s;u&s;ceptible
of deep impre&s;&s;ions, a legal provi&s;ion for
the poor would be rendered unnece&s;&s;ary:
it would relieve England from the poor
<PB N="71" REF="79">
rates, a grievous burden that undermines
both indu&s;try and morals. Give to each
of your children a &s;mall &s;um for charity.
Let them account to you for the di&s;po&s;al;
and to the child who has made the mo&s;t
judicious di&s;tribution, give double the
&s;um, to be laid out in the &s;ame way.
It is not my opinion, that a child's libe|rality
&s;hould be repaid with intere&s;t,
which Mr Locke advi&s;es, &s;ect. 110; for
this would encourage covetou&s;ne&s;s, not
benevolence.</P>
<P>THE practice of doing good, cannot
fail to improve a benevolent di&s;po&s;ition.
Occupy your pupil in relieving the indi|gent,
not only by his pur&s;e, but by kind|ly
offices. Convince him that he cannot
be more honourably employed.</P>
<P>COMPASSION may be envigorated in
a young mind, by a &s;ight of objects in
di&s;tre&s;s. But beware of making &s;uch
<PB N="72" REF="80">
&s;cenes too familiar, which would blunt
compa&s;&s;ion, in&s;tead of envigorating it.
Prie&s;ts and phy&s;icians, being employed
much about dying per&s;ons, have com|monly
little concern but to do their
duty.</P>
<P>INSTRUCT your pupils that they owe
civility to all, and that civility to the poor
will procure them more good-will, than
civility to the rich. Civility to the lat|ter
may be under&s;tood flattery: civility
to the former can have no cau&s;e but
humanity.</P>
<P><HI>3d,</HI> CURIOSITY is an an appetite implant|ed
in man for acquiring knowledge.
Children have it in perfection; for to
them every thing is new and unknown.
They are con&s;tantly a&s;king que&s;tions;
which ought to be an&s;wered according
to their capacity: to neglect their que|&s;tions,
or to laugh at them, &s;hows great
<PB N="73" REF="81">
ignorance of the principles of education;
for to give &s;atisfaction to children by an|&s;wering
their que&s;tions, has a direct ten|dency
to enlighten their minds. The
an&s;wer to one que&s;tion &s;ugge&s;ts common|ly
a &s;econd; and the ingenuity that &s;ome
children &s;how in &s;uch que&s;tions, is truly
&s;urpri&s;ing. Such corre&s;pondence between
parent and child, tends al&s;o to increa&s;e
their mutual affection: the parent is
plea&s;ed with the child's appetite for know|ledge;
and the child is fond of its pa|rent
for li&s;tening to it. &startq;Knowledge,&endq;
&s;ays Locke, &startq;is grateful to the under&s;tand|ing,
as light is to the eyes. Children
are delighted when their enquiries are
regarded, and their de&s;ire of knowledge
encouraged and commended.&endq;</P>
<P>STRONGER evidence there can be none
of man's di&s;po&s;ition for &s;ociety, than the
curio&s;ity all have about the character and
conduct of their fellow creatures. The
<PB N="74" REF="82">
fondne&s;s of children for &s;tories ought to
be laid hold of, as a mean no le&s;s plea&s;ing
than effectual for making virtuous im|pre&s;&s;ions,
that never wear out. A collec|tion
of proper &s;tories &s;eparated into cla&s;&s;es
that are adapted to different ages, would
be a valuable acqui&s;ition to the public.
The fir&s;t cla&s;s, fitted for children of four
or five, &s;hould contain &s;hort &s;tories, exhi|biting
pictures of virtue and vice expre&s;|&s;ed
in the &s;imple&s;t terms. The &s;econd
cla&s;s, adapted to the age of &s;ix or &s;even,
&s;hould contain &s;tories of the &s;ame kind,
a little more complicated. Let the third
contain regular &s;tories, di&s;playing the
good con&s;equences of virtue, and the bad
con&s;equences of vice, &s;till in a &s;imple &s;tile.
Here is room for the tutor, to inculcate
more fully the&s;e different con&s;equences.
This cla&s;s is proper to children from nine
to eleven. In the fourth cla&s;s, the &s;tile
may be rai&s;ed and refined; and &s;tories
&s;elected that afford a &s;triking moral; or
<PB N="75" REF="83">
in other words, that &s;how not only the
beauty, but the advantage of virtue; not
only the deformity, but the mi&s;chief of
vice. The la&s;t cla&s;s, fit for the fini&s;hing
&s;tage of education, may be of complicated
&s;tories in various &s;tiles, preferring what
have the mo&s;t obvious moral. This
cla&s;s may be ea&s;ily filled with a &s;election
from the numberle&s;s &s;tories of that kind
already in print. Such in&s;tructions, if
made a daily work, would be a great im|provement,
by &s;tamping on the mind vir|tuous
notions, at a time when it is the
mo&s;t &s;u&s;ceptible of impre&s;&s;ions. They
would al&s;o ripen the judgment, by enu|ring
the youth of both &s;exes, to think and
rea&s;on upon cau&s;es and con&s;equences.
When ab&s;urd &s;tories of gho&s;ts and appa|ritions,
make &s;o deep impre&s;&s;ions without
having any foundation in nature, have
we not rea&s;on to believe, that impre&s;&s;ions
equally deep, may be made by &s;tories of
benevolence, gratitude, friend&s;hip, parent|al
<PB N="76" REF="84">
and filial affection, and of other vir|tues
which have a &s;olid foundation in
nature? I think it is Mr Addi&s;on who
ob&s;erves, that the benevolence of the En|gli&s;h
pea&s;ants, is partly owing to the
&s;imple, but celebrated ballad, <HI>The Babes
of the Wood.</HI> The Archbi&s;hop of Cambray,
had a high opinion of this &s;ort of culture.
He compo&s;ed <HI>the Adventures of Telemachus</HI>
for the in&s;truction of his pupil, the Duke
of Burgundy; and other &s;weet fables
which every young per&s;on is delighted
with.</P>
<P>To fortify the impre&s;&s;ions made in the
cour&s;e of this culture, a &s;et of hi&s;torical
prints well cho&s;en would greatly contri|bute;
and as this is a plea&s;ing &s;tudy, it
may be u&s;ed as one of many rewards for
behaving well. I give for an example,
the hi&s;tory of the Prodigal Son, carried
on through &s;everal prints. Prepare your
pupils, by relating the &s;tory in an inte|re&s;ting
<PB N="77" REF="85">
manner: then exhibit the prints
one by one. They will be fond to ex|amine
each picture with every figure in
it; and with your help, will &s;oon be able
to explain the meaning. The mo&s;t im|portant
part remains, which is, to incul|cate
the moral, &startq;That children behaving
properly, will always find their parents
to be their be&s;t friends; and that even
when they go a&s;tray, &s;incere repentance
will re&s;tore them to favour.&endq; The
&s;tory of Jo&s;eph and his brethren in dif|ferent
prints, is another good example,
not only highly intere&s;ting, but affording
much in&s;truction. Hogarth's <HI>good Ap|prentice,</HI>
exhibits an excellent moral for
children; but is too complex for begin|ners.</P>
<P><HI>4th,</HI> AN important object that belongs
to every &s;tage of education, is the di&s;ci|plining
young people to re&s;train their de|&s;ires
and appetites; which is not difficult,
<PB N="78" REF="86">
if parents begin early to exert their ab&s;o|lute
authority. There is great virtue in
re&s;training an appetite when the temp|tation
is &s;trong; and &s;uch virtue in a
young per&s;on, cannot be &s;ufficiently ap|plauded.
If a child in&s;i&s;t, &s;ay dryly but
firmly, that it is not to be done. In
more advanced years, when rea&s;on be|gins
to peep out, explain the folly of it.
Children by &s;uch di&s;cipline, acquire gra|dually
the power of &s;elf-denial, highly
u&s;eful in the conduct of life. &startq;If the
child,&endq; &s;ays Mr Locke, &startq;mu&s;t have
grapes or &s;ugar-plums, when he has a
mind to them; why, when grown up,
mu&s;t he not be &s;atisfied too, if his de|&s;ires
carry him to wine or women?
He who is not u&s;ed to &s;ubmit his will
to the rea&s;on of others while he is
young, will &s;carce hearken or &s;ubmit
to his own rea&s;on when he is of an age
to make u&s;e of it.&endq; A pa&s;&s;ion directed
to a particular object; a beautiful fe|male
<PB N="79" REF="87">
for example, &s;oon exhau&s;ts it&s;elf by
its violence. An appetite that can be
gratified different ways, &s;uch as ambition
or avarice, may la&s;t for ever. In the
cour&s;e of education, appetites of that &s;ort
ought to be checked with &s;olicitude: if
they once get a &s;eat in the mind, it is vain
to think of expelling them. Children
are fond of things that touch the palate.
After dining in their nur&s;ery, introduce
your children to the gue&s;ts when the de|&s;ert
is on the table. If a child a&s;k any
thing, &s;ay dryly, &startq;You have dined, let
us dine: we demanded none of your
victuals, why &s;hould you have any of
ours?&endq; Renew this frequently, and
your children will acquire a habit of &s;ee|ing
without de&s;iring. A noble Lord,
now in heaven, favoured by Providence
with a family of fine children, permitted
no play-thing to be given them, leaving
them to invent amu&s;ements for them|&s;elves.
He ob&s;erved, &startq;That children
<PB N="80" REF="88">
are fond of toys, e&s;pecially of toys that
plea&s;e by their novelty; and that fre|quent
pre&s;ents to them of &s;uch things,
bring on a habit of intemperate long|ing
for trifles.&endq; Children tire the
&s;oone&s;t of what they are the fonde&s;t, but
without le&s;&s;ening their avidity for new
things; and if the&s;e be &s;upplied in plen|ty,
the appetite is &s;trengthened by habit,
requiring variety in play-things, as well
as beauty. This habit continues for life,
with no alteration but what proceeds
from age: the objects only are varied
from childi&s;h toys to tho&s; of idle men.
And hence the endle&s;s circle of minute
plea&s;ures, which to men of fortune be|come
nece&s;&s;aries of life. You cannot be|gin
too early, to check the de&s;ire that
children have for toys and gewgaws.
Take opportunity in pre&s;ence of your
children, to di&s;play your ornaments and
fine things. Carry them &s;ometimes to a
toy&s;hop. Make pre&s;ents to per&s;ons about
<PB N="81" REF="89">
you: let not your children hope to get
any pre&s;ent; and they will learn in time to
&s;ee &s;uch things with indifference. People
do not &s;ufficiently con&s;ider the mi&s;chie|vous
effects of indulging children in their
fancies: many men, who in their tender
years had been perverted by &s;uch indul|gence,
have di&s;&s;ipated great e&s;tates upon
mere trifles.</P>
<P><HI>5th,</HI> THERE is no incitement for beha|ving
well of greater efficacy, than to
let your child know, that you think it
worthy of being employed and tru&s;ted.
A lady of high rank gave the charge of
her confections to her daughter, a child
of four years. The child, accompanied
with her maid, was punctual in execu|ting
the commi&s;&s;ion; and no le&s;s faithful
than punctual, never having once offered
to purloin the &s;lighte&s;t thing. This ex|periment
requires, indeed, a faithful at|tendant:
if a child, committing a breach
<PB N="82" REF="90">
of tru&s;t, find that the &s;ecret can be kept,
it will go on in the &s;ame track, and the
con&s;equence will be deplorable. A re|gulation
in &s;ome boarding &s;chools, of
giving to an elder girl the care of two
younger, for dre&s;&s;ing them and giving
them le&s;&s;ons, is excellent. Tru&s;t your
young &s;on with papers, with money, with
a book, requiring him to pre&s;erve the&s;e
things carefully till called for.</P>
<P><HI>6th,</HI> AN article of the greate&s;t nicety,
is to enure children to keep a &s;ecret. Tell
your child any thing in the way of &s;e|cre&s;y,
not to be revealed on any account.
Have a faithful &s;ervant on the watch. If
you find that your child has blabbed,
mention not your informer, but &s;ay,
&startq;that the &s;ecret has taken air, and that
it mu&s;t have come from you. I do
not blame you much, becau&s;e you are
a child; but be more on your guard
hereafter.&endq; If the &s;ecret be kept, em|ploy
<PB N="83" REF="91">
a per&s;on to talk to the child, and to
endeavour to draw the &s;ecret from it. If
the child &s;tand firm, &s;ay to it after an in|terval,
&startq;I find you have kept my &s;ecret.
You are a good child, and you &s;hall
be my confident.&endq;</P>
<P><HI>7th,</HI> THE notion of property ari&s;es from
an innate &s;en&s;e, which teaches even infants
to di&s;tingui&s;h between <HI>yours</HI> and <HI>mine.</HI> It
is however during infancy &s;o faint, as in
mo&s;t children to yield to any vivid appe|tite.
As &s;ociety depends in a great mea|&s;ure
on the &s;en&s;e of property, neglect no
opportunity to fortify that &s;en&s;e in your
children. Make them &s;en&s;ible, that it is
a great wrong to take what belongs to
another. &startq;How would you like to have
your little dog taken from you by
force? The knife you have taken is
not yours, what right have you to
it? You ought to be &s;atisfied with
your own play-things, and not covet
<PB N="84" REF="92">
&startq;what belongs to another.&endq; Let not the
&s;lighte&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion e&s;cape: it ought
to be puni&s;hed with &s;hame and di&s;|grace.</P>

Third Stage.</HEAD>
<P>THE in&s;tructions hitherto given, re|quire
in children no degree of under|&s;tanding,
but what is derived from nature,
before the faculty of rea&s;on begins to be
unfolded. What are contained in the pre|&s;ent
&s;ection require &s;ome &s;hare of that fa|culty;
and upon that account, I term it
the third &s;tage of childhood. Education
during this &s;tage may be carried on not
only by facts and incidents as in the fore|going
&s;tages, but by advice, by exhorta|tion,
by moral le&s;&s;ons, which require rea|&s;on
on the child's part. But let tho&s;e who
pre&s;ide over education attend to the proper
time for carrying on this branch. Moral
le&s;&s;ons ab&s;tracted from facts, never make
any impre&s;&s;ion on children, unle&s;s to
<PB N="86" REF="94">
breed di&s;gu&s;t. When your pupil is agi|tated
with &s;ome incident that gives him
concern, take that opportunity to lecture
upon it, to &s;how its good or bad tenden|cy;
and you will be heard with avidity.
Except upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion, pure rea|&s;oning
will have no good effect. Dry
in&s;truction is for men only: the wi&s;e So|lomon
did not intend his Proverbs for
children.</P>
<P>THE great variety of matter that comes
under this &s;ection, requires it to be di|vided
into parts, beginning with the im|provement
of active virtues; next, the im|provement
of re&s;training virtues; third,
relative matters that fall not directly un|der
either head, but are nearly connected
with both.</P>
<P><HI>1&s;t.</HI> WITH regard to active virtues,
there is a beauty in candour and plain
dealing, which procures good will and
<PB N="87" REF="95">
affection even above many virtues that
make a more &s;plendid figure. Nature
prompts to this virtue; for no per&s;on
ever recurred to di&s;&s;imulation but to hide
&s;ome wrong. Candour is indeed a great
&s;weetner in &s;ociety, for without it there
can be no friend&s;hip nor mutual confi|dence.

It did not prevent him from

his German legions; nor from beating his

make him think it his own, which will
rai&s;e a de&s;ire to find out rea&s;ons. Exer|ci&s;e
is not more &s;alutary to the body
than to the mind. When he wants to
have any thing done, let him fir&s;t try
what he can do him&s;elf. A &s;avage ha|ving
none to apply to for advice or di|rection,
is reduced to judge for him&s;elf
at every turn: he makes not a &s;ingle &s;tep

<P>HITHERTO of improving our active
virtues. We proceed to the improvement
of our re&s;training virtues. When chil|dren
are very young, the parent has no
way for checking an irregular appetite,
but authority alone, and this is handled
in the &s;ection immediately foregoing.
When the faculty of rea&s;on begins to ap|pear,
then is the time for rea&s;oning with
your children, and for di&s;playing to them
the bad con&s;equences of indulging any
irregular appetite. Let them be indulged
freely in every thing that tends to their
good; but give no quarter to what may
tend to harm them. A young man, ac|cu&s;tomed
<PB N="94" REF="102">
from childhood to weigh his
inclinations, and to re&s;train what may be
hurtful, is fitted for making an amiable
figure. A young man on the contrary
who has been gratified in every de&s;ire
without re&s;traint, can never make a good
figure. Every &s;plendid object &s;trikes
his fancy, and rai&s;es a de&s;ire of making
it his own. If admitted to a palace, he
is mortified that his father's hou&s;e is &s;o
mean; and &s;till more, that he him&s;elf
makes no figure compared with the land|lord.
If he meets with a young man
more gaily dre&s;&s;ed than him&s;elf, he mur|murs
at the avarice of his parents. Nor
can &s;uch mortification have any end;
for among the numberle&s;s objects of his
wi&s;hes, there are perhaps very few within
his reach. And now to particulars.</P>
<P><HI>1&s;t,</HI> WHEN any irregular appetite breaks
out, endeavour immediately to repre&s;s it.

its aim. Its aim is to make a fi|gure;
and yet it renders the per&s;on an
object of ridicule, never of re&s;pect: not
to mention, that it lays open an unguard|ed
heart to the machinations of per&s;ons
ill inclined. Cimon the Athenian ama&s;&s;ed
a great fortune; but be&s;towed it liberally
on the poor, and on keeping an open
table for every per&s;on who wanted a din|ner.
&startq;What compari&s;on, &s;ays Plutarch,
between the table of Cimon, &s;imple,
frugal, popular, and that of Lucullus,
contrived for o&s;tentation, and to feed
the luxurious.&endq; Nothing fo&s;ters va|nity
in a young creature &s;o much as
dre&s;&s;ing it out gorgeou&s;ly; and yet a
fond parent in&s;tead of endeavouring to
correct that vice, is prone to give it en|couragement.
When little mi&s;s is dre&s;|&s;ed
in her new gown, one would ima|gine

<PB N="96" REF="104">
perceiving this bias in its mother, values
dre&s;s highly, and de&s;pi&s;es every one who
goes more plain. Is there no hazard that
children thus trained, will when grown
up, regard dre&s;s as the chief qualification
of people of fa&s;hion? To correct or
re&s;train an appetite for fine cloaths,
the following method among others
promi&s;es &s;ucce&s;s. Load your girl with
ornaments. Say to tho&s;e in company,
that &s;he never looked wor&s;e. One adds,
is &s;he not pretty enough to become a
more &s;imple dre&s;s? Take away every
&s;uperfluous ornament, and then com|mend
her appearance: &startq;How genteel
and how &s;weet &s;he now looks.&endq; The
girl will acquire a ta&s;te for &s;implicity.
Get your &s;on a coat daubed over with
gold or &s;ilver, but &s;o ill made as to pain
him. Be&s;peak people to ridicule him for
his finery. He will be glad to change
this na&s;ty coat for one more ea&s;y and
more agreeable. Were it the fa&s;hion

children plain, it would have a wonder|ful
good effect, not only on them&s;elves,

would learn to de&s;pi&s;e fine cloaths, and
to value them&s;elves on good behaviour:
neatne&s;s and elegance would be the &s;ole
aim in dre&s;s. As &s;oon as children are
&s;u&s;ceptible of verbal in&s;truction, let them
know that the chief u&s;e of cloaths is to
keep them warm; and that to be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
by their finery, will make them

again&s;t what is faulty. Too great

of its &s;ad con&s;equences, may in a think|ing

&s;ome effect. But there is a &s;imple
le&s;&s;on more ea&s;ily under&s;tood by a young
per&s;on, and more effectual, which is, to
be ob&s;tinately &s;ilent while you are angry.
Let it be kept in memory what Socrates
&s;aid to a &s;lave who had mi&s;behaved, &startq;I
would treat thee as thou de&s;erve&s;t,
were I not in a pa&s;&s;ion.&endq; This re&s;traint
may be at fir&s;t difficult; but by due
attention in the tutor it will become ea&s;y,
and prevent every bad effect of the pa&s;|&s;ion.
If it be thought too difficult to in|&s;i&s;t
upon &s;o perfect a cure at once, be|gin
with in&s;tructing your pupil to copy
a Roman Emperor, who made it a rule,
that before opening his mouth in wrath,
he &s;hould repeat lei&s;urely all the letters
of the alphabet. I promi&s;e &s;uch an effect
to this &s;imple rule, as in time to lead the
pupil to keep &s;ilence while any degree of
<PB N="106" REF="114">
the pa&s;&s;ion remains. Above all, the young
man &s;hould be doubly on his guard when
injured or affronted. A fiery temper break|ing
out upon every in&s;ult, is ill qualified
for &s;ociety: if not early re&s;trained, it will
occa&s;ion manifold di&s;tre&s;&s;es. The very be&s;t
way to avoid great injuries, is to overlook
or di&s;&s;emble what are &s;mall. This holds
in an e&s;pecial manner with re&s;pect to the
female &s;ex. Women, who are not framed
for &s;ingle combat, ought above all things
to dread the making a noi&s;e in the world.
For &s;ubduing the impatience of your pu|pil
under an injury, one good method is
to give him examples of di&s;tre&s;&s;es occa|&s;ioned
by &s;uch impatience. In the hi&s;to|ry
of ancient Greece, there is a glorious
in&s;tance of the good effects of re&s;traint.
Euribiades, admiral of the Grecian fleet
collected again&s;t the Per&s;ians, angry to be

a complete victory. The cool be|haviour

after a long ab&s;ence; and upon the
di&s;appointment, exhort them to bear it
with a good grace: this will have a much
finer effect than exhortations in general.
But let the di&s;appointment appear to pro|ceed
from chance; for if they perceive
your intention, they will conclude that
it was done to vex them, not to improve
<PB N="109" REF="117">
their temper. A gentleman, though other|ways
of good under&s;tanding, erred in this
branch of education. He had three come|ly
girls between twelve and &s;ixteen; and
to enure them to bear di&s;appointments,
he would propo&s;e to make a vi&s;it, which
he knew would delight them. The coach
was be&s;poke; and the young ladies, com|pletely
armed for conque&s;t, were ready
to take their &s;eats. But behold! their
father had changed his mind. This in|deed
was a di&s;appointment; but as it ap|peared
to proceed from whim or caprice,
it might &s;our their temper in&s;tead of im|proving
it. Children are early &s;en&s;ible
of ill treatment; and when the parental
authority is too far &s;tretched, a child
obeys from fear not from affection.</P>
<P><HI>2d,</HI> IT is a capital duty in parents, to
teach their children to bear with and ex|cu&s;e
the faults of their companions. There
are even adult per&s;ons who perceive no
<PB N="110" REF="118">
blemi&s;h in one they love, nor any virtue
in one they hate. To correct that wrong
bias in young per&s;ons, is not an ea&s;y un|dertaking,
nor to be attempted till they
have acquired &s;ome &s;hare of under&s;tand|ing.
Talk to your pupils of their com|panions.
Point out faults, which how|ever
are &s;o &s;light, compared with their
good qualities, as to make them not the
le&s;s de&s;erving of affection. In&s;truct your
pupils, that perfection is not to be found
in any human being: bid them reflect
whether they them&s;elves are entirely ex|empt
from failings. And conclude with
ob&s;erving, that among friends and com|panions,
it is a &s;weet commerce to forgive
one another. If proper opportunities be
taken, &s;uch le&s;&s;ons will produce two good
effects, namely, to excu&s;e the faults of a
friend, and to re&s;pect virtue in an enemy:
the latter will &s;often enmity; and the
former will cement friend&s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="119">
<HI>3d,</HI> IN the third &s;ection at the begin|ning,
are contained in&s;tructions for keep|ing
children always employed. I here
add &s;everal particulars on the &s;ame &s;ub|ject,
fitted for children farther advanced
in years. A girl of eight or nine may be
trained to a&s;&s;i&s;t her mother in &s;erving the
gue&s;ts at table. Let her be &s;eated with|in
reach of a pudding, or of any thing
that requires little carving, ready to help
tho&s;e who call for it. In a &s;hort time,
&s;he may be employed in di&s;&s;ecting a
chicken or even a pullet. The notion of
being u&s;eful and behaving like her mam|ma,
in&s;pires her with a certain dignity
of behaviour, and &s;ets her above childi&s;h
amu&s;ements. It has pained me to &s;ee a
young woman of &s;eventeen or eighteen,
applying a knife &s;o aukwardly as with
difficulty to di&s;&s;ect what is on her own
plate. How mean mu&s;t be her appear|ance
at the head of her own table! I am
acquainted with the mi&s;tre&s;s of a great
<PB N="112" REF="120">
family, who gives &s;till more employment
to her daughter, not above the age of &s;e|ven.
The child is employed to in&s;pect
the bed-rooms, that every thing may be
in order for the gue&s;ts. A company were
to depart about eight in the morning.
&startq;Child,&endq; &s;ays the lady, &startq;I perhaps may
not be up &s;o early. Be ready to at|tend
the company: &s;ee that every thing
be prepared for breakfa&s;t; and be &s;ure
to attend them to their coach.&endq;</P>
<P><HI>4th,</HI> NEXT of an article that ought not
to be neglected, and yet is not a little dif|ficult,
which is to accu&s;tom children to
acknowledge their faults. It is not &s;uf|ficient
that parents by gentle treatment
have acquired the affection of their chil|dren:
education will go on but imper|fectly,
if children be not al&s;o trained to
place confidence in their parents, and to
apply to them freely in every difficulty.
The nice&s;t point of all, is to enure them
<PB N="113" REF="121">
to an ingenuous confe&s;&s;ion of faults, the
only ca&s;e in which I approve auricular
confe&s;&s;ion. This practice, early com|menced,
will &s;oon become habitual. A
child cuts a finger, or breaks a china cup.
It is unhappy till it acquaint its father
or mother how it happened. Let a can|did
acknowledgment be an ab&s;olute par|don:
let it be the part of the parent to
mitigate the fault; and to ob&s;erve, that
the child de&s;erves more prai&s;e for its
frank confe&s;&s;ion, than blame for the fault
it has committed; that the fear of di&s;co|very
when a fault is concealed, makes a
heavy heart; but that the heart is re|lieved
by a fair confe&s;&s;ion. Affection to
parents leads children to put confidence
in them. What is there to ob&s;truct that
confidence, but har&s;hne&s;s and &s;everity?
A child will never confe&s;s a fault if afraid
to be ill treated: it will di&s;&s;emble, it will
lie, it will do any thing to avoid di&s;co|very.
When a child withdraws from its
<PB N="114" REF="122">
parents and makes any other per&s;on its
confident, farewel to education. But
when children are treated kindly, they
never think of any confident but the per|&s;on
who takes care of them. By kindly
treatment, the heart is laid open, and
every wrong bias is di&s;covered, which
afford a fair opportunity for good culture.
Let us look forward to a child's riper
years, and reflect on the habit of can|dour
and ingenuity thus acquired: what
anxious thoughts, what di&s;&s;imulation,
mu&s;t this charming habit have prevent|ed!</P>
<P>AMONG the various ways of training
children to confe&s;s their faults, the fol|lowing
can &s;carce fail of being &s;ucce&s;sful.
Returning home after a vi&s;it of a week or
two, put each of your children to &s;ay,
what good has been done by the re&s;t;
and what ill it&s;elf has done. The former
endears them to one another, the latter
<PB N="115" REF="123">
re&s;trains them from committing faults.
Make the&s;e articles the &s;ubject of conver|&s;ation:
endeavour to ripen the under|&s;tanding
of the young creatures, by &s;how|ing
them what is right and what is wrong.
But be careful to provide a tru&s;ty per&s;on
to inform you of any fault that has been
concealed. Say to the child &s;lightly,
&startq;Surely, my dear, you have a bad me|mory,
did you not do &s;o and &s;o.&endq; It
will think it vain to hide, as &startq;Papa or
Mamma knows every thing.&endq;</P>
<P>IT is a pregnant &s;ign of a good di&s;po&s;i|tion,
that a child of it&s;elf corrects a fault.
A girl between three and four, having
got a pre&s;ent of fruit, was de&s;ired by its
mother to give part of it to her compa|nions.
Having re&s;erved a large &s;hare to
her&s;elf, &s;he di&s;tributed the re&s;t, giving
&s;ome to an elder &s;i&s;ter, now a woman.
After devouring what &s;he had retained,
&s;he de&s;ired back her &s;i&s;ter's &s;hare, and got
<PB N="116" REF="124">
it. The mother expo&s;tulated, but in vain;
and having left the room, the &s;i&s;ter &s;aid,
&startq;My dear, I make you welcome to the
fruit, but you behave ill in di&s;obeying
your mamma.&endq; This gentle reproof,
having touched the child in the tender
part, that of obedience, had its effect.
After a day or two, &s;he reque&s;ted more
fruit from her mother, which, with an
air of &s;atisfaction &s;he carried to the &s;i&s;ter.
Correction may be nece&s;&s;ary &s;ometimes;
but for a child to correct a fault of its
own accord, is extremely plea&s;ant. A
child about three years of age, took &s;ome
cotton thread which Mi&s;s B&mdash;was &s;ow|ing
upon mu&s;lin. &startq;Pray child give me
the cotton, you will dirty it.&endq; The
child refu&s;ing, Mi&s;s B&mdash;, laying a&s;ide her
work, &s;aid gravely, &startq;Would you have
been plea&s;ed had I dirtied your doll?&endq;
Some weeks after, the child ob&s;erving
cotton thread in the hands of another
young lady, begged earne&s;tly for it to
<PB N="117" REF="125">
give to Mi&s;s B&mdash;. Such in&s;tances &s;ugge&s;t
the following rule. When a child from
petulence or perver&s;ene&s;s mi&s;behaves
gro&s;sly, &s;tern authority ought to be in|terpo&s;ed.
In other faults, expo&s;tulation
and advice are far better.</P>
<P>A voluntary confe&s;&s;ion is a &s;till more
pregnant &s;ign of a good di&s;po&s;ition. A
young lady aged eleven, of a rank higher
than which there are none, having hurt
a finger accidentally, &s;howed &s;ome degree
of impatience. The governe&s;s, having
in vain endeavoured to &s;hame her out of
it, left the room with a reproachful look,
&s;aying, that &s;he could not bear to &s;ee &s;uch
concern for a mere trifle. In le&s;s than
an hour, &s;he received a billet from her
pupil, acknowledging her mi&s;behaviour,
and intreating to be forgiven. Happy
temper! the riche&s;t gift that nature has
to be&s;tow, and of which nature is far
from being prodigal. Few there are of
<PB N="118" REF="126">
any rank who are ble&s;&s;ed with a temper
&s;o pliant; fewer &s;till of high rank. But
the prai&s;e mu&s;t not be attributed entirely
to temper: &s;eldom is pure nature &s;o re|fined.
The young lady owes much to
an affectionate mother, who&s;e high &s;ta|tion
has not made her relax from attend|ing
to the education of her children, with
a degree of prudence and &s;agacity, that
would give lu&s;tre to per&s;ons much infe|rior
in rank.</P>
<P><HI>5th,</HI> CHILDREN are far from being all
of them equally flexible. It required a
week to make a boy of two years dip his
fingers in water after dinner. Example
had no effect, nor exhortation. The mo|ther
put into the gla&s;s fruit he was fond
of: neither did that prevail. She thought
at la&s;t of the gardener's &s;on, a child of
the &s;ame age, who readily dipt his fingers
and laid hold of the fruit. Emulation
prevailed: young ma&s;ter dipped his fin|gers
<PB N="119" REF="127">
in&s;tantly. I am plea&s;ed with the in|genuity
of the mother; but reli&s;h not the
&s;truggling again&s;t accidental aver&s;ions,
which time will correct without trouble.
Authority, in&s;tead of &s;ubduing, tends to
rivet &s;uch an aver&s;ion. It is not always
ea&s;y to di&s;tingui&s;h an acquired aver&s;ion
from what is natural; and when autho|rity
is interpo&s;ed, may not there be a ha|zard
of &s;truggling again&s;t nature? Many
&s;urely will remember certain eatables
abhorred by them when children, which
at pre&s;ent they are fond of without
having &s;uffered per&s;ecution. In health,
nature is the &s;ure&s;t guide in the choice
of food. The &s;ame food may be &s;alu|tary
at one period of life, and not at a|nother.
Will parents pretend to be wi&s;er
than nature? I am far, however, from
wi&s;hing to have children indulged in
whim or fancy. If a child refu&s;es what
is &s;et before it, hunger will &s;oon bring
<PB N="120" REF="128">
it to order. If it con&s;tantly refu&s;e after
repeated trials, the aver&s;tion mu&s;t have
a deeper root than whim or fancy.</P>

<P><HI>1&s;t,</HI> NEGLECT no favourable opportu|nity
of in&s;tilling into your pu|pils,
that a man ought to be regarded in
proportion to the good he does; and
that compared with the being u&s;eful,
the di&s;tinction between rich and poor,
high and low, is of little importance;
that an indu&s;trious pea&s;ant who edu|cates
his children to be u&s;eful members
of &s;ociety, is entitled to more re&s;pect
than the great lord, who, in the mid&s;t
of indigent neighbours, lavi&s;hes immen&s;e
&s;ums upon him&s;elf, without ever think|ing
of others.</P>
<P><HI>2d,</HI> MAKE your pupil &s;en&s;ible, that in
order to &s;ave for charity or benevolence,
oeconomy is an e&s;timable virtue. Au|gu&s;tus
Cae&s;ar, Emperor of Rome, never
<PB N="122" REF="130">
wore a garment but what was &s;pun by
his wife Livia or his &s;i&s;ter Octavia. Sci|pio,
the glory of Rome and terror of
Carthage, dre&s;&s;ed his garden with his
own hands. The venerable old &s;enator
Fabricius, illu&s;trious by many triumphs,
&s;upped commonly on the herbs that he
him&s;elf had rai&s;ed. A &s;tranger who
wi&s;hes to be well received, ought to be
hand&s;omely dre&s;&s;ed; but a plain coat
&s;its better on a man of known eminence,
who will be copied by others, without
derogating from his rank.</P>
<P><HI>3d,</HI> SELF-LOVE makes us labour for
our&s;elves; benevolence makes us labour
for others: emulation is added to en|force
the&s;e motives to action. Emula|tion,
inherent in the nature of man, ap|pears
even in children: they &s;trive for
victory without knowing what makes
them &s;trive. Emulation kept within
proper bounds is an u&s;eful principle,
<PB N="123" REF="131">
and far from being un&s;ociable: it be|comes
only &s;o, when by exce&s;s it dege|nerates
into envy. Why then is it ba|ni&s;hed
by Rou&s;&s;eau, from his &s;y&s;tem of
education? Was it his purpo&s;e to di&s;tin|gui&s;h
his <HI>Eleve</HI> from the re&s;t of man|kind,
by a peculiar nature? Approba|tion
is be&s;towed on tho&s;e who behave
well; but in &s;truggling for victory, the
pro&s;pect of being approved is a very
faint motive compared with emulation.
Through the force of that incitement,
a young man will per&s;ervere in acquiring
knowledge, who without it, would have
made no progre&s;s. It ought, therefore,
to be the &s;tudy of every teacher, to give
&s;uch a direction to emulation in his pu|pil,
as to produce the greate&s;t effect. A
crowd of competitors damps it: a very
&s;mall number is not &s;ufficient to rou&s;e it.
The proper &s;tage for emulation, is a pri|vate
&s;chool, admitting not above twelve
<PB N="124" REF="132">
or fifteen di&s;ciples. A family of &s;ix or
&s;even children, may give exerci&s;e to it.</P>
<P><HI>4th,</HI> WITH re&s;pect to the improvement
of memory, it is &s;evere to make children
get by heart prayers, p&s;alms, or other
dry compo&s;itions, which they neither re|li&s;h,
nor can well under&s;tand. Put into
their hands &s;hort hi&s;torical ballads that
make virtuous impre&s;&s;ions, or give lively
de&s;criptions of objects they are acquaint|ed
with, e&s;pecially of the gay and ludi|crous
kind. The&s;e they will get by
heart of their own accord, and be fond
to repeat them to their parents or their
companions. This exerci&s;e ought to be
entirely voluntary. Were the getting a
thing by heart impo&s;ed as a ta&s;k by the
preceptor, it would be ea&s;y to &s;ome and
a heavy burden upon others. Emula|tion
ought to be here excluded, except,
perhaps, among boys who are found to
be equal in point of memory.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="133">
<HI>5th,</HI> THERE is no branch of di&s;cipline
that ought to be exerci&s;ed with more
caution, than the di&s;tribution of rewards
and puni&s;hments. If money, a fine coat,
or what plea&s;es the palate, be the reward
promi&s;ed; is it not the ready way to fo|ment
avarice, vanity, or luxury? Prai&s;e
is an efficacious reward, of which even
children are fond; and when properly
applied, it never fails to produce good
behaviour. Puni&s;hment requires &s;till
more caution; as it ought to be propor|tioned
to the temper of the pupil as well
as to the nature of the fault. I cannot
recollect a fault that requires corporal
puni&s;hment but ob&s;tinancy, which is in|herent
in &s;ome per&s;ons. Lying I think
may be corrected or rather prevented by
proper management: my rea&s;on is, that
it is not inherent in our nature, but for|ced
upon a child by har&s;h treatment.
Any fault except ob&s;tinacy, that a child
can be guilty of, may be repre&s;&s;ed by
<PB N="126" REF="134">
&s;hame and di&s;grace, which &s;ink deep in|to
the heart of children, as well as of
men and woman. To keep children in
awe by the fear of corporal puni&s;hment,
will put them upon hiding their faults,
in&s;tead of correcting them<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Si cui tam e&s;t mens illiberalis, ut objurgatione non corrigatur: is etiam ad plagas, ut pe&s;&s;ima quae|que mancipia, durabiter. <HI>Quintil.</HI> lib. 1. c. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I GLADLY lay hold of this opportunity
to make a general ob&s;evation, of no
&s;light importance with re&s;pect to educa|tion.
Among &s;avages, who&s;e ruling pa&s;|&s;ions
are anger and re&s;entment, every
thing is carried on by force and fear.
That &s;avage practice makes &s;till &s;ome
figure among poli&s;hed nations. Schools
for education were erected upon the pri|ciple
of puni&s;hment; very unhappily in|deed,
as puni&s;hment, in&s;tead of &s;oftening
or improving manners, tends to harden
tho&s;e who &s;uffer by it. Humanity in
time prevailed over vicious education;
<PB N="127" REF="135">
and a &s;acred truth was di&s;covered, that
man is a creature from whom every thing
may be obtained by love, nothing by
fear. The &s;everity of &s;chool-puni&s;hments,
has gradually yielded to the conviction
of this important truth; and yet &s;uch
is the force of cu&s;tom, that in&s;tances re|main,
not a few, of the old &s;tile of edu|cation.
To dwell upon the&s;e in&s;tances,
would be irk&s;ome: I confine my&s;elf to
one, illu&s;trious indeed, as it relates to E|ton,
a &s;chool in high vogue. In that
&s;chool, there &s;tands expo&s;ed to open view,
the terrible block that the boys mu&s;t
kneel upon to receive a flogging, perhaps
as often from the bad humour of the
ma&s;ter as from the demerit of the offend|er.
And that the boys may never lo&s;e
&s;ight of puni&s;hment, matters are &s;o con|trived
as to furni&s;h examples once a
week at lea&s;t, chiefly on Monday, which
in the language of the &s;chool, has obtain|ed
the illu&s;trious appellation of the day
<PB N="128" REF="136">
of doom. Would one imagine, that a
di&s;cipline &s;o brutal, &s;hould &s;tand firm,
even again&s;t the humanity of our pre&s;ent
manners. Glad am I to be able to
give te&s;timony in favour of my native
country, that in our &s;chools, few traces
remain of that inhuman practice. I dare
not &s;ay none, were I even to keep with|in
the capital.</P>
<P><HI>6th,</HI> THE la&s;t recommendation I &s;hall
give on the pre&s;ent head, is, that young
per&s;ons, male and female, &s;hould have
always at hand a common-place book,
for keeping in remembrance ob&s;ervations
made in reading, reflecting, conver&s;ing,
travelling. The advantages are mani|fold.
<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> it keeps the attention awake,
in order that nothing of importance may
e&s;cape. Con&s;ider this practice as to read|ing.
A per&s;on who reads merely for
amu&s;ement, gives little attention: ideas
glide through the mind, and vani&s;h in|&s;tantly.
<PB N="129" REF="137">
But let a common-place book
be in view: attention is on the &s;tretch to
find matter, and impre&s;&s;ions are made that
the memory retains. <HI>Next,</HI> The judgment
is in con&s;tant exerci&s;e, in order to di&s;|tingui&s;h
what particulars de&s;erve remem|brance.
<HI>Third,</HI> Per&s;everance in this prac|tice,
brings on a habit of expre&s;&s;ing our
thoughts readily and di&s;tictly. <HI>Fourth,</HI>
A facility of writing currently is acquired.
And, in the <HI>la&s;t</HI> place, it fills up time
plea&s;antly, and makes activity habitual.</P>
<P><HI>7th,</HI> THE following hints are directed
more immediately to the governors. The
bad habits that children are apt to ac|quire
from &s;ervants, are an ob&s;truction
to education. I know of no remedy, but
to keep children as much as po&s;&s;ible un|der
the eye of their parents. This will
be no re&s;traint, if they be fond of their
parents; which they always are, when
kindly treated and indulged in innocent
<PB N="130" REF="138">
freedom. It &s;hould be held as a puni&s;h|ment
for a fault, to be ordered down
&s;tairs among the &s;ervants. But this re|quires
circum&s;pect conduct on the part
of the parents; who ought carefully to
avoid the doing or &s;aying of any thing
but what they wi&s;h their children to
imitate. It is amazing, how early chil|dren
adopt the manners of tho&s;e they are
among. This circum&s;pection ought to
be extended even to the per&s;ons who are
hired to attend them.</P>
<P>LET truth prevail in all your in&s;truc|tions:
in rea&s;oning with your children,
never u&s;e any artifice. Some children
are quick of di&s;cernment: the di&s;covery
of an artifice will tempt them to pay their
guides in the &s;ame coin.</P>
<P>THE keeper ought to be well acquaint|ed
with the mute language of the infant
under her care. An infant cries from
<PB N="131" REF="139">
bodily pain. It cries when it is hungry;
and gives over when it &s;ees things pre|pared
for feeding it. It is not uncom|mon
in a child at play, to fall a-crying;
not from anger, but from inability to ex|pre&s;s
what it wants. If the keeper be
ignorant of what troubles the child, &s;he
will be at a lo&s;s about a remedy.</P>
<P>IF a child have any defect in its &s;hape
that cannot ea&s;ily be hid, let the defect
be frankly acknowledged, and even made
a joke of at times. This will prevent
whi&s;pering, which always makes a de|fect
appear wor&s;e than it really is. Phi|lopemen,
the greate&s;t General of his age,
was of a mean apperance. He went to
an invited dinner in his camp-dre&s;s, with|out
a &s;ingle attendant. Being taken for
one of the General's &s;ervants, he was or|dered
to the kitchen to cut logs for the
fire. His friend the landlord, &s;eeing

<HEAD TYPE="sub">PECULIARITIES re&s;pecting the Educa|tion
of FEMALES.</HEAD>
<P><HI>1&s;t,</HI> THE different in&s;tincts of the two
&s;exes appear very early. A boy
is continually in action, loves a drum, a
top, to ride on a &s;tick. A girl, wi&s;hing
to be agreeable, is fond of ornaments
that plea&s;e the eye. She begins with a
doll, which &s;he dre&s;&s;es and undre&s;&s;es, to
try what ornaments will &s;uit be&s;t. In
due time, the doll is laid a&s;ide; and the
young woman's own per&s;on becomes the
object of her attention. This in&s;tinct
rightly directed, advances from propriety
of dre&s;s to that of behaviour, &s;till in or|der
to plea&s;e. Employ therefore a young
girl upon what will adorn her: &s;he will
apply to the needle more willingly than
to reading or writing. As &s;he advances,
<PB N="134" REF="142">
let her be taught the art of drawing, not
human figures, which cannot be made
ornamental, but leaves, flowers, and &s;uch
things as tend to enliven her dre&s;s. Chil|dren
are fond of lively colours; and hence
their ta&s;te for &s;howy dre&s;s and ornaments
of gold and &s;ilver. Here the prudent
mother interpo&s;es with a le&s;&s;on &startq;that
dre&s;s ought to be &s;uited to the age and
rank of the wearer; that &s;implicity is
becoming in dre&s;s as well as in man|ners;
that the fa&s;hion &s;hould not be
totally di&s;regarded, but that it ought to
yield to propriety.&endq; A fond mother
never thinks of &s;uch a le&s;&s;on; beauty is
exalted above every qualification: and if
a girl have any &s;hare of it, dre&s;s alone is
&s;tudied. If to her looks can be added a
genteel air and elegant motion in dancing
or walking, &s;he becomes a perfect angel.
Thus, external appearance is highly cul|tivated,
and little attention given either
to the head or heart. Is it wonderful,
<PB N="135" REF="143">
that a young woman &s;o educated, &s;hould
make but an aukward figure in educa|ting
her own children?</P>
<P>FEMALES have a flexible tongue, and
acquire more early than males the u&s;e of
&s;peech: their voice is &s;weeter; and they
talk more. A man &s;ays what he knows;
a woman, what is agreeable: knowledge
is nece&s;&s;ary to the former; ta&s;te is &s;uffi|cient
to the latter. The politene&s;s of
men con&s;i&s;ts in offering &s;ervice; of wo|men,
in making them&s;elves agreeable.
In the politene&s;s of men, there is more
or le&s;s of di&s;&s;imulation; none in that of
women, for they love to be agreeable.
Hence it is, that politene&s;s has a more
plea&s;ing air in young women, than in
young men.</P>
<P><HI>2d,</HI> A MAN'S conduct depends mo&s;tly
on the approbation of his own con&s;cience;
that of a woman, greatly on the opinion
<PB N="136" REF="144">
of others. A man who does his duty,
can brave cen&s;ure: a woman's conduct
ought to be exemplary, in order to be
e&s;teemed by all. The lea&s;t doubt of her
cha&s;tity, deprives her of every comfort in
the matrimonial &s;tate. In the education
of females accordingly, no motive has a
greater influence, than the thought of
what people will &s;ay of them. Boys are
not &s;o tractable: it requires much di&s;|cipline
to make them bend to the opi|nion
of others. Hence, to be e&s;teemed
by all, mode&s;ty and re&s;erve are e&s;&s;en|tial
in young women; to acquire which,
they ought to be taught early to &s;up|pre&s;s
their de&s;ires, and to have a &s;trict
attention to decency and decorum. But
under &s;uch re&s;traint, let the occupations
of young women be made as agreeable as
po&s;&s;ible. A girl who loves her mother
or her governe&s;s, will work the whole day
at her &s;ide without wearying, provided
&s;he be allowed to prattle, which is her fa|vourite
<PB N="137" REF="145">
amu&s;ement. A girl who loves
not her mother above all the world, &s;el|dom
turns to good. Even confinement
properly managed, rivets her attachment;
becau&s;e children are made &s;en&s;ible by na|ture,
that obedience is their duty, and
that it is good for them to be governed.
Indulge gaiety, indulge laughter, indulge
play, but &s;till within moderate bounds.
Draw them frequently from play to
work, but in &s;o &s;oft a way as to pre|vent
murmuring: cu&s;tom will make the
change ea&s;y, and produce in time en|tire
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the mother's will.
This is e&s;&s;ential to the female &s;ex, for
ever &s;ubjected to the authority of a &s;ingle
per&s;on, or to the opinion of all.</P>
<P><HI>3d,</HI> FEMALE children ought to be hardily
bred, not only for their own health, but
to have a healthy offspring. Chiefly with
a view to the latter, it was fa&s;hionable
for the Spartan young ladies to mix with
<PB N="138" REF="146">
the men in military games, not excepting
wre&s;tling and other violent exerci&s;es.
This &s;urely was not prompted by nature,
which does not intend women to be &s;o
robu&s;t. For the &s;ake of health, all that
is nece&s;&s;ary is plain food, with frequent
walking or riding.</P>
<P><HI>4th,</HI> AT Athens, the young women ap|peared
frequently in public, but &s;eparate
from the young men. In every fea&s;t, in
every &s;acrifice, in every public &s;olemnity,
the daughters of the principal citizens
were introduced, crowned with flowers,
dancing in parties, &s;inging hymns, and
pre&s;enting offerings to their deities. Such
exerci&s;es, be&s;ide contributing to health,
formed the ta&s;te of the young women to
what is proper and agreeable; and made
them objects of de&s;ire without hazarding
their morals. In France, the education
of young women is very different. They
are &s;hut up in a convent, and never ta&s;te
<PB N="139" REF="147">
freedom till they are married. A &s;y&s;tem
of education more hurtful to morals, is
&s;carce within the reach of invention.
Unnatural confinement in a convent,
makes a young woman embrace with a|vidity
every plea&s;ure, when &s;he is &s;et free.
To reli&s;h dome&s;tic life, one mu&s;t be ac|quainted
with it; for it is in the hou&s;e
of her parents that a young woman ac|quires
the reli&s;h. A di&s;creet matron will
attend her daughters to an a&s;&s;embly, to
an opera, to the play-hou&s;e; but &s;he will
in&s;truct them, that the plea&s;ure they find
there, ought to be con&s;idered as an a|mu&s;ement
merely, unfit to employ much
of the time of young women, who are
de&s;tined by nature to govern a family.
What can be more prepo&s;terous than the
behaviour of an idle woman, leading her
daughters from riot to riot, without gi|ving
admi&s;&s;ion to a &s;edate thought? A
lady carried to Bath her two daughters,
aged between twelve and fourteen, in or|der
<PB N="140" REF="148">
to give them &s;ome notion of living
in public. Their natural gaiety, &s;he
thought, would be improved by the gaie|ty
of the place; that the company at
Bath would contribute to form their
manners; and that they were too young
to &s;uffer by their male companions. It
was her opinion, that her daughters were
of a proper age for reli&s;hing public meet|ings,
without lo&s;ing the ta&s;te of dome&s;tic
tranquillity.</P>
<P><HI>5th,</HI> IN training young women, ex|hibite
every thing to them in an agree|able
light; and in particular, &s;uffer them
not to imagine that there can be any pain
in doing what is right. Is it painful for
a young woman to make her&s;elf ami|able
in order to be loved, to make her|&s;elf
e&s;timable in order to be e&s;teemed,
to behave honourably in order to be ho|noured?
The influence of a young wo|man,
commences with her virtues. What
<PB N="141" REF="149">
man is there, however rough in temper,
who &s;oftens not his behaviour to a young
woman of &s;ixteen, intere&s;ting even by her
ba&s;hfulne&s;s, and commanding that re|&s;pect
from all which &s;he be&s;tows on all?
Virtue is e&s;&s;ential to genuine love. To
&s;upport that &s;weet pa&s;&s;ion in any refined
degree, there mu&s;t be mutual e&s;teem,
which cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without virtue. How
de&s;picable in my eyes mu&s;t that creature
be, with whom I have no connection but
for the &s;ake merely of animal de&s;ire?</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>APPENDIX TO SECTION VI.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER &s;o much dry matter, &s;ome
relaxation will probably be made
welcome; and in that view the following
female characters are pre&s;ented. The fir&s;t,
by Marivaux, is a character of which be|nignity
of heart is the ruling principle.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="150">
MADAME de Miran had con&s;iderable
remains of beauty; but there appeared in
her countenance, &s;omething &s;o good and
&s;o rational as to ob&s;cure the&s;e remains.
Frankne&s;s and good nature are not
friendly to love. We admire the wo|man,
but her graces make little impre&s;|&s;ion:
we enjoy her company, without
thinking that &s;he is pretty, but only that
&s;he is the be&s;t creature in the world. I
have accordingly heard little of Madame
de Miran's lovers, but much of her
friends. It is reported, that &s;he had
friends even of her own &s;ex; which I
can believe, con&s;idering her plain and
innocent mien, which gave no jealou&s;y
to her female companions, and made
her appear more like a confident than a
rival.</P>
<P>TO a phy&s;iognomy more plea&s;ing than
bewitching, to eyes demanding amity
more than love, was added a genteel fi|gure,
<PB N="143" REF="151">
which might have given de&s;ire had
&s;he &s;o inclined; but &s;he never &s;tudied
any motion but what was nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to her under&s;tanding, I
know not that any one ever thought of
prai&s;ing it; nor do I know that any one
ever &s;aid it was deficient. It was of a
&s;ort that is li&s;tened to attentively; but
without being cen&s;ured or applauded.</P>
<P>EVEN in matters of indifference, Ma|dame
de Miran &s;aid nothing, thought
nothing, but what verified that abound|ing
goodne&s;s which was the foundation
of her character. But do not imagine it
to be a &s;illy or blind goodne&s;s, ridiculed
even by tho&s;e whom it &s;erves. Her's was
a virtue, an emanation from an excellent
heart, which never exerted it&s;elf at the ex|pence
of rea&s;on, nor of ju&s;tice. She had
not indeed any of that quality termed
noblene&s;s of &s;oul: her goodne&s;s was
<PB N="144" REF="152">
more &s;imple, more amiable, though le&s;s
&s;plendid. I have known per&s;ons with
that &s;ame noblene&s;s of &s;oul, who had not
the be&s;t hearts in the world. They were
&s;o occupied with the plea&s;ure of being
generous, as to be negligent of being ju&s;t.
Such per&s;ons love to be prai&s;ed: Madame
de Miran never once thought of de&s;er|ving
prai&s;e: &s;he never exerted an act of
benevolence in order to gratify her&s;elf,
but in order to relieve you. If you ex|pre&s;&s;ed
much gratitude to her, what flat|tered
her the mo&s;t was to find you &s;atis|fied.</P>
<P>I HAD almo&s;t forgot one thing, not a
little &s;ingular. Though this lady never
vaunted of her own good deeds, you
might vaunt to her of yours with all &s;e|curity.
The plea&s;ure of hearing you &s;ay
that you was good, made your vanity
pa&s;s unob&s;erved, or made her think it ex|cu&s;able.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="153">
AS to tho&s;e tire&s;ome creatures who va|lue
them&s;elves upon trifles, who are vain
of their rank or their riches, they gave no
vexation to Madame de Miran: &s;he had
no affection for them, and that was all.
Bablers who &s;lander others, though with|out
intention, gave offence to the good|ne&s;s
of her nature; whereas the vain of|fended
her rea&s;on only. She bore the
loquacious with temper; &s;miling only at
the fatigue they gave her, without ever
&s;u&s;pecting it. In company with the
whim&s;ical or head&s;trong who li&s;ten not
to rea&s;on, &s;he had patience, and was ne|verthele&s;s
their friend. &startq;They are ho|ne&s;t
people,&endq; &s;he ob&s;erved, &startq;they have
their little failings, and who is without
them.&endq; A coquet who in&s;i&s;ts upon
being admired, was lower in her e&s;teem
than a woman who once in her life had
been more in love than a woman ought
to be; it being le&s;s faulty in her opinion
<PB N="146" REF="154">
to mi&s;behave once, than perpetually to
be tempting others to mi&s;behave.</P>
<P>THIS lady con&s;idered religion as chiefly
intended to enforce moral duties. She
re&s;pected tho&s;e who be&s;tow their whole
time on execi&s;es of devotion, but with|out
ever thinking of joining them. Never
had any per&s;on better rea&s;on to be con|vinced
of the benignity of the Deity:
her conviction proceeded from her heart;
and no per&s;on had a better heart. She
accordinlgy loved God &s;incerely, without
being di&s;turbed with any &s;uper&s;titious
terrors.</P>
<P>THE next portrait is of a lady every way
accompli&s;hed, done by the &s;ame hand.</P>
<P>MADAME Dor&s;in was beautiful; and
yet it was not her beauty that even at fir&s;t
made the &s;tronge&s;t impre&s;&s;ion. It yield|ed
to another impre&s;&s;ion. This wants
<PB N="147" REF="155">
explanation. Per&s;onify beauty; and &s;up|po&s;e
her unea&s;y for being &s;o &s;trikingly
beautiful; that &s;he wi&s;hes to be agreeable
only; and that &s;he endeavours to le&s;&s;en
her beauty, but without hiding it altoge|ther.
Such would be the countenance of
Madame Dor&s;in.</P>
<P>BUT here I talk only of her looks,
what may be expre&s;&s;ed in a portrait. Add
a &s;oul that animated her looks, that ren|dered
them as delicate, as lively, as ele|vated,
as &s;erious, as jocular, as &s;he her&s;elf
was by turns; and then you will be able
to imagine in her looks, an infinity of
expre&s;&s;ions beyond the reach of painting.
Let us now examine that &s;oul, &s;ince we
are on the &s;ubject. When one has little
&s;pirit, it is commonly attributed to de|fective
organs. An acquaintance, talking
on this &s;ubject, &s;aid gravely and in learn|ed
terms, &startq;that the &s;oul is more or le&s;s
confined, more or le&s;s embarra&s;&s;ed, ac|cording
<PB N="148" REF="156">
to the organs to which it is
united.&endq; If &s;o, nature mu&s;t have con|ferred
on Madame Dor&s;in organs in high
perfection; for never was a &s;oul more
agile than hers, nor le&s;s confined in its
operations.</P>
<P>THE &s;pirit that mo&s;t women exert, is
acquired, not natural. One expre&s;&s;es her|&s;elf
carele&s;sly and with &s;eeming indiffer|ence,
to make people believe that &s;he can|not
take the trouble of thinking. One
talks with a &s;erious and deci&s;ive air. One
deals in refined thoughts, and pronounces
them in a tone that calls for attention.
One affects to be lively and loud. Ma|dame
Dor&s;in affected none of the&s;e pecu|liarities.
It was the &s;ubject that gave a
tone to her thoughts; and it was her
thoughts that gave a tone to her expre&s;|&s;ion.
I hope to be under&s;tood when I
&s;ay, that her &s;pirit had no &s;ex; and that
it was enchanting when &s;he was in hu|mour
<PB N="149" REF="157">
to di&s;play it. Few pretty women
but are over fond to plea&s;e; and hence
tho&s;e little affectations which virtually
&s;ay, <HI>behold me.</HI> Such apei&s;h tricks were
not reli&s;hed by Madame Dor&s;in: her
pride would not permit her to de&s;cend
&s;o low. If upon any occa&s;ion &s;he relaxed
a little, no one was &s;en&s;ible of the &s;lip but
her&s;elf. In general, &s;he valued her un|der&s;tanding
more than her beauty: it was
her you honoured in prai&s;ing the former:
it was her figure only, in prai&s;ing the lat|ter.
To appear agreeable was not her
&s;tudy: it would have made her blu&s;h if
you could &s;ay, &startq;That lady has endea|voured
to make me fond of her.&endq; In
a word, the only coquetry &s;he could be
&s;u&s;pected of, was her willingne&s;s that
you &s;hould be &s;en&s;ible, how much &s;he de|&s;pi&s;ed
all the little arts of plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>FROM her under&s;tanding we proceed to
the qualities of her heart. Her goodne&s;s
<PB N="150" REF="158">
equalled that of Madame de Miran, but
was of a different ca&s;t. Goodne&s;s in the
latter was connected with plain &s;en&s;e: in
the former, it was connected with &s;upe|rior
under&s;tanding, which makes it al|ways
&s;how in the mo&s;t advantageous
light. When one confers a favour on
me, and &s;eems ignorant of its import|ance,
my pride is not alarmed, a &s;light
return of gratitude is in my opinion &s;uf|ficient.
But a favour done me with a
thorough &s;en&s;e of its importance, humbles
my pride, and lays on me a heavy bur|den
of gratitude. This was not the only
re&s;pect in which the goodne&s;s of Madame
Dor&s;in was preferable. People &s;eldom
have the courage to di&s;play all their
wants. Madame de Miran &s;erved you
cheerfully, but literally, &s;eeing no far|ther.
Madame Dor&s;in, di&s;covering your
wants from your imperfect hints, &s;erved
you to the utmo&s;t of your wi&s;hes. It
was not her you fatigued with your con|cerns:
<PB N="151" REF="159">
&s;he fatigued you. It was you &s;he
advi&s;ed, pre&s;&s;ed, chid for being negligent.
She in a word made your affair her own:
the intere&s;t &s;he took in you appeared &s;o
much her own concern, as to lo&s;e entire|ly
the character of genero&s;ity. In&s;tead of
thinking as mo&s;t people do, &startq;I have
&s;erved this man, and he owes me much
gratitude,&endq; Madame Dor&s;in's notion
was, &startq;I have &s;erved this man frequent|ly,
I have accu&s;tomed him to depend
on me, I mu&s;t not di&s;appoint him.&endq;
Your boldne&s;s in demanding a favour
charmed her, and was all the gratitude
&s;he wi&s;hed. It was treating her accord|ing
to her own heart.</P>
<P>IT is not ea&s;y for people of &s;pirit to
bring them&s;elves down to a level with
tho&s;e who have none&mdash;they cannot find
a &s;ubject low enough. Madame Dor&s;in,
though &s;he had a greater &s;hare of &s;pirit
than tho&s;e who have much, yet never
<PB N="152" REF="160">
a&s;&s;umed more &s;pirit than others had. She
thought that no human being is entitled
to laugh at the imperfections of others.
Tho&s;e who had &s;pirit were fond to di&s;|play
it in her pre&s;ence; not as nece&s;&s;ary
to plea&s;e her, but to honour them&s;elves.
She indulged her female companions to
talk at their ea&s;e, &s;eldom interrupting
but to approve, to prai&s;e, and to allow
them to draw breath.</P>
<P>MEN differing in rank and condi|tion,
&s;eldom make good company toge|ther.
Each di&s;plays what di&s;ingui&s;hes
him above the re&s;t. In Madame Dor&s;in's
hou&s;e, there was no thought of rank, nor
of any other di&s;tinction. They were
men who conver&s;ed with men; and the
&s;tronge&s;t rea&s;on always prevailed. The
&s;uperiority of her genius in&s;pired every
one.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="161">
To an excellent heart, to a di&s;tingui&s;h|ed
under&s;tanding, was joined a &s;oul &s;upe|rior
to events, which could be afflicted
but not dejected, and which in di&s;tre&s;s
one never thinks of pitying, but of prai|&s;ing.
I have &s;een her more than once in
affliction; but could never ob&s;erve, that
it had any effect on the &s;weetne&s;s of her
manners, nor on her tranquillity in con|ver&s;ing
with her friends: &s;he gave her
attention wholly to them, though &s;he
had cau&s;e to give it wholly to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>SHE was adored by her dome&s;tics;
who held them&s;elves richer becau&s;e &s;he
was &s;o, and con&s;idered every misfortune
happening to her as happening to them|&s;elves.
So little notion had they of a &s;e|parate
intere&s;t, that in every particular
they joined them&s;elves with her, &startq;We
have gained a cau&s;e, we have purcha|&s;ed
a farm, we have lo&s;t a friend.&endq; She
was highly generous; but the oeconomy
<PB N="154" REF="162">
of her dome&s;tics made all up. Judge how
amiable the mi&s;tre&s;s mu&s;t have been, to
tame, to enchant, a &s;pecies of beings, the
very be&s;t of whom can &s;carce pardon us
for their &s;ervitude, or for our &s;uperiority.</P>
<P>THE next portrait is done by the cele|brated
Rou&s;&s;eau, exhibiting the charac|ter
of a young woman virtuou&s;ly edu|cated.</P>
<P>SOPHIA is not a beauty, but in her
pre&s;ence beauties are di&s;contented with
them&s;elves. At fir&s;t, &s;he &s;carcely appears
pretty; but the more &s;he is beheld, the
more agreeable &s;he appears. She gains
when others lo&s;e, and what &s;he gains &s;he
never lo&s;es. She is equalled by none in
a &s;weet expre&s;&s;ion of countenance; and
without dazzling beholders, &s;he intere&s;ts
them. She loves dre&s;s, and is a good
judge of it; de&s;pi&s;es finery, but dre&s;&s;es
with peculiar grace, mixing &s;implicity
<PB N="155" REF="163">
with elegance. Ignorant &s;he is of what
colours are in fa&s;hion; but knows well
what &s;uits her complexion. She covers
her beauties, but &s;o &s;lightly or rather art|fully,
as to give play to the imagination.
She prepares her&s;elf for managing a fa|mily
of her own, by managing that of
her father. Cookery is familiar to her,
with the price and quality of provi&s;ions;
and &s;he is a ready accountant. Her chief
view however is to &s;erve her mother and
lighten her cares. She holds cleanne&s;s

and that a &s;lattern is di&s;gu&s;ting,
e&s;pecially if beautiful.</P>
<P>THE attention given to externals, does
not make her overlook her more material
duties. Sophia's under&s;tanding is &s;olid,
without being profound. Her &s;en&s;ibility
is too great for a perfect equality of tem|per;
but her &s;weetne&s;s render that ine|quality
harmle&s;s. A har&s;h word does
<PB N="156" REF="164">
not make her angry; but her heart
&s;wells, and &s;he retires to di&s;burden it by
weeping. Recalled by her father or mo|ther,
&s;he comes at the in&s;tant, wipeing
her eyes and appearing chearful. She &s;uf|fers
with patience any wrong done her;
but is impatient to repair any wrong &s;he
has done, and does it &s;o cordially as to
make it appear meritorious. If &s;he hap|pen
to di&s;oblige a companion, her joy
and her care&s;&s;es, when re&s;tored to favour,
&s;how the burden that lay upon her good
heart.</P>
<P>THE love of virtue is Sophia's ruling
pa&s;&s;ion. She loves it, becau&s;e no other
thing is &s;o lovely: &s;he loves it, becau&s;e
it is the glory of the female &s;ex: &s;he loves
it as the only road to happine&s;s, mi&s;ery
being the &s;ure attendant of a woman
without virute; &s;he loves it, as dear to
her re&s;pectable father and tender mother.
The&s;e &s;entiments in&s;pire her with a de|gree
<PB N="157" REF="165">
of enthu&s;ia&s;m, that elevates her &s;oul
and &s;ubdues every irregular appetite.</P>
<P>OF the ab&s;ent &s;he never talks but with
circum&s;pection, her female acquaintance
e&s;pecially. She has remarked, that what
renders women prone to detraction, is
talking of their own &s;ex; and that they
are more equitable with re&s;pect to ours.
Sophia therefore never talks of women,
but to expre&s;s the good &s;he knows of
them: of others &s;he &s;ays nothing.</P>
<P>WITHOUT much knowledge of the
world, &s;he is attentive, obliging and
graceful in all &s;he does. A good di&s;po|&s;ition
does more for her, than much art
does for others. She po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a degree
of politene&s;s, which, void of ceremony,
proceeds from a de&s;ire to plea&s;e, and
which con&s;equently never fails to plea&s;e.</P>

THE next portrait is of a fine woman

none; is never mi&s;&s;ed by fancy or vanity,
but guided &s;ingly by rea&s;on. Whatever
&s;he &s;ays or does, is the manife&s;t re&s;ult of
a happy nature, and a good under&s;tand|ing;
though &s;he knows whatever women
ought, and it may be more than they
are required to know. She conceals the
&s;uperiority &s;he has, with as much care as
others take to di&s;play the &s;uperiority they
have not: &s;he conforms her&s;elf to the
turn of the company &s;he is in, but in a
way of rather avoiding to be di&s;tanced,
than de&s;iring to take the lead. Are they
merry, &s;he is chearful; are they grave,
&s;he is &s;erious; are they ab&s;urd, &s;he is
&s;ilent. Though &s;he thinks and &s;peaks
as a man would do, &s;he effeminates, if I

may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion, whatever &s;he &s;ays,
and adds all the graces of her own &s;ex to
the &s;trength of ours. She is well bred
without the trouble&s;ome ceremonies and
frivolous forms of tho&s;e who only affect
to be &s;o. As her good breeding proceeds
jointly from good nature and good &s;en&s;e,
the former inclines her to oblige, and the
latter &s;hows her the ea&s;ie&s;t and be&s;t way
of doing it. Women's beauty like men's
wit, is generally fatal to the owners, un|le&s;s
directed by a judgment that &s;eldom
accompanies a great degree of either.
Her beauty &s;eems but a proper and de|cent
lodging for &s;uch a mind. She knows
the true value of it; and far from think|ing
that it authori&s;es impertinence and
coquetry, it redoubles her care to avoid
tho&s;e errors that are its u&s;ual attendants.
Thus, &s;he not only unites in her&s;elf all
the advantages of body and mind, but
even reconciles contradictions in others;

a native rectitude of &s;oul: &s;he had not

or acting. Her di&s;po&s;ition was at the
&s;ame time &s;o &s;weet, as never to feel the
&s;lighte&s;t emotion of hatred, malignity,
envy, nor even ill humour. No other wo|man
ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;o many graces of con|ver&s;ation;
nor, to a wit &s;o &s;ubtile and re|fined,
added a more perfect &s;implicity of
manners. The plea&s;ing as well as more
elevated qualities, were &s;o happily blend|ed

<HEAD TYPE="sub">EDUCATION with re&s;pect to RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>THE mo&s;t delicate branch of educa|tion,
is that which concerns reli|gion.
All human beings have an innate
&s;en&s;e of right and wrong, by means of
which children are &s;u&s;ceptible of moral
in&s;truction. They li&s;ten to an intere&s;t|ing
&s;tory, take an affection to tho&s;e who
behave well, and an aver&s;ion to tho&s;e
who behave ill. Such exerci&s;e, which
moulds the heart to virtue, has one pecu|liar
advantage, that it is highly agree|able:
children never tire of it<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The following little &s;tory is &s;o &s;weet and inte|re&s;ting, that I am fond of any pretext to introduce it; and my pretext is, that it is an additional proof of the &s;en&s;e of right and wrong being innate; though that fact is &s;o firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed in the opinion of every rational per&s;on, as to render any new evidence very little nece&s;&s;ary. A female child was born deaf and dumb. At four years of age, when her parents were clearly &s;en&s;ible of her defect, they &s;ent her to a boarding &s;chool at Bri&s;tol; and left her there for years, without providing either for board or cloaths. The father, who died a few years ago, left his wife and &s;on in good circum&s;tances, with L. 1000 to each of his younger children, the &s;ame &s;um to his dumb daughter in ca&s;e &s;he &s;hould come to the u&s;e of &s;peech; otherways an annuity only of L. 30 to com|mence when &s;he &s;hould be of age. Since the fa|ther's death, &s;he was vi&s;ited by her brothers and &s;i&s;ters, but without any mark of affection, not a &s;ingle word about the board either from mother or children. So much upon the dark &s;ide of the pro|&s;pect. Now to the bright &s;ide. Sophia, which is the young woman's name, is of &s;o mild and amiable a di&s;po&s;ition, that the boarding mi&s;tre&s;&s;es have adopt|ed her for their daughter. Their claim is con&s;ider|able for board, cloaths, and education; but they forbear &s;uing for it, le&s;t the young woman &s;hould be taken from them. In needle-work, drawing, dancing, and mimicry, &s;he excels. But what only is to the pre&s;ent point, her mi&s;tre&s;&s;es vouch upon every occa&s;ion, that her ideas of ju&s;tice and moral rectitude are extremely correct, and that her prac|tice is entirely conformable to them. Ideas of right and wrong may be improved by education; but without a foundation in nature, an attempt to incul|cate them would be no le&s;s un&s;ucce&s;sful, than an at|tempt to give an idea of colour to one born blind.</NOTE>. Children
<PB N="162" REF="170">
are equally &s;u&s;ceptible of in&s;truction with
regard to natural religion. The being
<PB N="163" REF="171">
of a God and the wor&s;hip due to him,
being engraved on the mind, make a
branch of our nature. As nature thus
takes the lead, it is the duty of parents
to &s;econd nature. They ought to incul|cate
into their children, that God is their
friend and heavenly Father; and that
they ought to perform his will, which is
to do all the good they can. Convince
them that God is always pre&s;ent, and
that not a thought can be concealed from
him. Accompany every one of your le&s;|&s;ons
with de&s;cribing the Deity as bene|volent
and humane, wi&s;hing the good of
his creatures, and rewarding the virtuous,
if not in this life, a&s;&s;uredly in a life to
come<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Sketches of the Hi&s;tory of Man. Second Edit. vol. 4. page 359.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As this is a capital branch of educa|tion,
I think the mo&s;t capital, it merits
great attention. It is ea&s;y to fortify in
<PB N="164" REF="172">
children the belief of a Deity, becau&s;e his
exi&s;tence is engraved on the human heart;
but it is far from being ea&s;y to fortify
belief, &s;o as to become a ruling principle
of action. And yet this is indi&s;pen&s;able;
for belief without producing that effect,
is of little &s;ignificancy in any ca&s;e; and
lea&s;t of all with re&s;pect to the duties of
religion, which are the great and ulti|mate
end of in&s;truction. In order that
a firm belief of the Deity may warm
the mind to per&s;evere in what is right,
the following hints may be of u&s;e to pa|rents
and tutors. Take early proper op|portunities
of talking plea&s;antly to your
children of their heavenly Father, who
loves them, and who, though un&s;een, is
always doing them good; that he created
the &s;un to warm them, and made the
earth to produce every thing nece&s;&s;ary
for their nouri&s;hment and for their
cloathing. In fine weather, lead them
to the fields, and point out to them the
<PB N="165" REF="173">
various beauties of nature. &startq;How beau|tiful
that &s;mooth plain inter&s;ected with
a &s;tream perpetually flowing; how com|fortable
to the eye its verdure, and
how beneficial by giving food to many
innocent and u&s;eful animals! Behold
that gay parterre, variegated with a
thou&s;and &s;weet colours. See that noble
oak &s;preading its branches all around,
affording a &s;hade in &s;ummer, and &s;hel|ter
in winter. Li&s;ten to the birds which
chear us with their mu&s;ic, and are
bu&s;ily employed in bringing forth their
young.&endq; Impre&s;s it upon the minds
of your children, that all the&s;e things
are contrived by our heavenly Father to
make us happy; and that it ought to be
our chief delight to te&s;tify upon all oc|ca&s;ions
our gratitude to him.</P>
<P>WHEN a child has behaved well, fail
not to let it know, that it has given plea|&s;ure
to its heavenly Father, and that he
<PB N="166" REF="174">
will reward it when he &s;ees proper. In
&s;ickne&s;s, exhort it to &s;uffer patiently; be|cau&s;e
it is in the hands of God, who will
do what is be&s;t for it. If this chearful
doctrine be carefully in&s;tilled into the
hearts of children, they will acquire a
habit of con&s;idering the Deity in the a|miable
light of a friend and benefactor,
who never will for&s;ake them.</P>
<P>BUT though it is nece&s;&s;ary to de&s;cribe
the Deity, not only as a friend to the
good, but as an enemy to the wicked;
be in no hurry with the latter, nor let it
be mentioned till the benevolence of the
Deity be deeply rooted in the mind of
your children. When they are duly pre|pared,
de&s;cribe him as loath to puni&s;h,
ready to forgive tho&s;e who repent, an
enemy to hardened &s;inners only; that he
is angry indeed at children who mi&s;be|have,
but that &s;o are their parents; that
good children are not afraid of their pa|rents;
<PB N="167" REF="175">
and as little rea&s;on have they to
be afraid of their heavenly Parent.</P>
<P>RELIGIOUS education thus carried on,
in&s;tead of in&s;piring gloomine&s;s and de|&s;pondence,
will contribute more than any
other means to &s;erenity of mind and chear|fulne&s;s
of temper. I zealou&s;ly recommend
this &s;ort of di&s;cipline to parents, knowing
that it is not &s;ufficiently attended to.
Surely, any frightful notion of the Deity,
mu&s;t have a di&s;mal effect on a tender
mind, &s;u&s;ceptible of every impre&s;&s;ion,
that of fear above all. Man formerly
was thought to be of a nature &s;o perver&s;e,
as to be governed by fear only, never by
affection; and our Maker accordingly
was repre&s;ented as &s;evere and unfor|giving.
The dread thus in&s;pired into
young per&s;ons, produces naturally abject
&s;uper&s;tition in a weak mind; and in the
bold and thoughtle&s;s, a total neglect of
religion. As the latter character is the
<PB N="168" REF="176">
more common, it cannot be &s;urpri&s;ing to
find among us &s;uch neglect of religion.</P>
<P>STORIES compo&s;ed in order to fortify
rational notions of the Deity, would have
a good effect on children of nine or ten;
the hi&s;tory, for example, of a young wo|man
who never did a thing of moment,
without fir&s;t con&s;idering whether it would
be agreeable to her Maker; who by
that means led a chearful and innocent
life, and was beloved by all; or the hi|&s;tory
of a young man, who, &s;educed by
a train of temptations, lo&s;t &s;ight of his
Maker, and plunged headlong into vice.
After a debauch, he dreamed that God,
appearing with an angry countenance,
threatned a &s;evere puni&s;hment. He &s;tart|ed
from &s;leep in extreme agony: his
wicked cour&s;es &s;tared him in the face:
he prayed ardently for pardon, and made
a vow never again to lo&s;e &s;ight of his
Maker. The remainder of his life was
<PB N="169" REF="177">
no le&s;s exemplary for goodne&s;s, than the
former part for vice. The lively impre&s;|&s;ion
of God's pre&s;ence and &s;uperintend|ence,
promoted by &s;uch hi&s;tories, will
guard again&s;t vice more effectually, than
the actual pre&s;ence of the mo&s;t awful per|&s;on
on earth. A man &s;o educated will
as little think of hiding his intentions
from his Maker, as of hiding them from
him&s;elf.</P>
<P>CONSIDERING how liable children are
to the ab&s;urd impre&s;&s;ions of gho&s;ts and
apparitions, can it be thought that they
will be le&s;s open to the impre&s;&s;ion of the
Deity, which has a &s;olid foundation in
nature? Examples are many of a con|nection
&s;o intimate between two friends,
as that the image of the predecea&s;ed was
always pre&s;ent to the &s;urvivor, rejoicing
with him in pro&s;perity, and comforting
him in adver&s;ity. Surely, we are &s;u&s;cep|tible
of a connection with our Maker,
<PB N="170" REF="178">
equally intimate. I have often experi|enced
the force of early impre&s;&s;ions in
trivial matters, far le&s;s apt than the pre|&s;ence
of the Deity to occupy the mind.
In the morning between &s;leeping and
waking, I frequently imagine my&s;elf to
be in the bed-chamber I occupied during
childhood, the door here, the window
there, very different from the form of
my pre&s;ent bed-chamber: nor am I un|deceived,
till perfectly awake. From the
window of my &s;tudy looking to the fields
in a reverie, the &s;ight of a tree, re&s;em|bling
one in my original habitation, has
frequently made me think my&s;elf to be
there; &s;o as even to contradict my eye|&s;ight,
by &s;ub&s;tituting, in&s;tead of the pre|&s;ent
pro&s;pect, the one I had been accu&s;|tomed
to during my tender years. As
more than half a century has elap&s;ed
&s;ince my infancy, the&s;e facts &s;how clear|ly,
that early impre&s;&s;ions never are obli|terated.
It is true, that I have nothing
<PB N="171" REF="179">
for the&s;e facts but my own evidence;
but, as nature is the &s;ame in all, I take
it for granted that &s;imilar in&s;tances have
occurred to many.</P>
<P>YOUNG per&s;ons duly initiated in the
comforts of religion, hold their Maker to be
their firme&s;t friend and their mo&s;t power|ful
protector. They retire to private de|votion,
with the alacrity of one who goes
to vi&s;it a bo&s;om friend; and the hours
that pa&s;s in that exerci&s;e, are remember|ed
with entire &s;atisfaction. In every dif|ficulty
they apply to their Maker: they
pray to him in affliction; and in pro&s;pe|rity
they pour out their grateful heart to
him. Parents! attend above all other
concerns to the education of your chil|dren:
riches and honours are as nothing
in compari&s;on. It is in your power to
&s;tamp on their ductile mind, &s;o deep an
impre&s;&s;ion of a benevolent Deity, as to
become their ruling principle of action.
<PB N="172" REF="180">
What prai&s;e do you not merit, if &s;ucce&s;s|ful:
what reproach, if negligent? I have
a firm conviction, that if a due impre&s;|&s;ion
of the Deity be not &s;ufficient to &s;tem
the tide of corruption in an opulent and
luxurious nation, it is vain to attempt a
remedy<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>I can have no doubt but that the following let|ter upon this &s;ubject, will be as agreeable to the public, as it was to me.</P>
<P>&startq;I am very glad to hear, that you again have taken up your pen for the public &s;ervice; e&s;pe|cially as you begin at that &s;ea&s;on on which the whole harve&s;t of life depends. We, who are farmers, know the ground mu&s;t be tilled, cleaned, and good &s;eed carefully &s;own, if we mean to reap a rich crop. I am proud to find, I have always followed your plan of religion, with the infants that have been under my care. Whenever they have admired the &s;un's refulgent beams, the love|ly orb of the moon, or any of the &s;triking beau|ties of nature, I have endeavoured to rai&s;e their thoughts to the great Creator, and to &s;et before them his Maje&s;ty, without the terrors that might drive them from the contemplation. In their &s;ea&s;ons of recreation and innocent delights, I have repre&s;ented him as the indulgent parent, from who&s;e bounty they enjoyed &s;uch ble&s;&s;ings, and who at all times can be&s;tow every good, and guard from pain and evil. The fear of God is the beginning of wi&s;dom; but the love of God is the parent of devotion. When, as men, they go forth into the world, and temptations throng a|round them, they ought then to con&s;ider God in the awful character of a legi&s;lator, carefully to obey his laws, and to dread the di&s;plea&s;ure that mu&s;t be the con&s;equence of di&s;obedience to laws on which the general welfare depends; no le&s;s in fact, though not &s;o apparently, than on the re|gular cour&s;e of the tides, or &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the &s;ea|&s;ons. Nor will this any way impair the early principle of the love of God; for the more bene|volent the lawgiver is, the more &s;trictly will be require obedience to laws upon which our happi|ne&s;s depends.&endq;.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="181">
WHEN your children, by regular train|ing,
come to have a warm &s;en&s;e of devo|tion,
then is the time for entering them
into the exerci&s;e of prayer. Teach them
to pray for their parents, for their rela|tions,
and above all that God will pre|&s;erve
them from doing ill. Say your
prayers before them &s;hortly and pathe|tically:
they will imitate you without
compul&s;ion. But pre&s;cribe not at fir&s;t
regular hours; which to very young
<PB N="174" REF="182">
creatures prove irk&s;ome and fatiguing.
Encourage them however to acquaint
you when they have performed that du|ty.
After being thus fairly initiated in
an agreeable practice, it will not be diffi|cult
to introduce gradually more regula|rity.
Let them know that regularity will
prevent neglect and remi&s;&s;ne&s;s, which
cannot fail to be a burden on their &s;pi|rits;
that the morning and the evening
are the mo&s;t proper times; the former to
thank their Maker for the light of a new
day, and to be&s;eech him not to leave
them to them&s;elves; the latter to attri|bute
it to him if they have behaved well,
and to beg pardon if they have done any
thing ami&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT I re&s;t here, purpo&s;ing at the end
of this &s;ection to pre&s;ent the reader
with an illu&s;tration of this &s;ubject by
another hand. I reckon upon &s;uffering
by the compari&s;on; but I renounce &s;el|fi&s;h
<PB N="175" REF="183">
views for the &s;ake of my fellow citi|zens.</P>
<P>WHAT remains with re&s;pect to religi|ous
education, is to add a few hints upon
revealed religion. This may be thought
an extreme delicate point; becau&s;e in en|deavouring
to in&s;truct young people in
the revelation that ought to be embraced,
there may be danger of leading them
a&s;tray. As revealed religion is not &s;tamp|ed
on the heart, but requires profound
rea&s;oning and the knowledge of many
ob&s;cure facts, we are apt to conclude
that it ought to be delayed till the fa|culty
of rea&s;on be ripe; which re&s;olves
in leaving every per&s;on to judge for them|&s;elves.
But this opinion ought not to be
adopted; for as the generality of men are
incapable to judge of a matter &s;o intri|cate,
they mu&s;t be led. Now, I &s;ay, that
it is better for them to be led in their
younger years by a kindly parent or tutor,
<PB N="176" REF="184">
than to be left to form an opinion after|ward
as chance &s;hall direct. For this rea|&s;on,
I am clear that children be educated
in the religion e&s;tabli&s;hed or tolerated by
law. Nor ought this to be con&s;idered as
a ra&s;h conce&s;&s;ion; for &s;ure I am, that
ninety-nine of a hundred have no better
foundation to build their faith upon.
It may be demanded then, where lies
the merit of a Chri&s;tian above a Maho|metan
or a Pagan? I admit, that it can|not
lye in following blindly the profe&s;&s;ion
of one's ance&s;tors. But as the Chri&s;tian re|velation
is the mo&s;t perfect of all, and the
pure&s;t in its doctrines, it is highly meri|torious
in a Turk or a Pagan, who &s;eeks
truth with a &s;incere heart, to become a
true Chri&s;tian. At the &s;ame time, I am
far from thinking, that Chri&s;tianity is
the only road to heaven. All who have
a good heart with a clear con&s;cience, will
meet with the &s;ame reward. It is not
material in the &s;ight of the Almighty,
<PB N="177" REF="185">
whether the religion they have been
taught is or is not orthodox, provided
they be &s;incere. People follow naturally
and innocently the faith of their parents;
and the generality have no other means
for embracing a revelation, real or pre|tended.
How few are there who can de|pend
on their own judgment, in making
a choice! Are people to be condemned
for judging wrong, who cannot judge at
all? To me therefore it appears evident|ly
the will of God, that &s;incerity &s;hould
be the only title to his favour, leaving
men to their own belief.</P>
<P>IT is at the &s;ame time extremely con|venient,
that people &s;hould be of the re|ligion
of their country. Therefore, what|ever
unlucky doubts or &s;cruples may
haunt a man with re&s;pect to that reli|gion,
he ought to conceal them from his
children. In a Chri&s;tian country, let him
employ all hone&s;t means to breed his
<PB N="178" REF="186">
children &s;incere Chri&s;tians. To that end,
among other particulars more material,
a &s;et of prints repre&s;enting the hi&s;tory of
the Old and New Te&s;tament, will contri|bute
greatly. Young creatures delight
in pictures; and by that means, the ma|terial
facts relative to Chri&s;tianity may be
deeply &s;tamped on their minds, leaving
when they grow up little inclination to
doubt of their reality.</P>
<P>HERE indeed I zealou&s;ly exhort pa|rents
and teachers to guard again&s;t bi|gotry
and &s;uper&s;tition, which, if early
&s;own in young minds, are not ea&s;ily
rooted out. Teach your children to pre|fer
their own religion; but inculcate
at the &s;ame time that the virtuous are
acceptable to God, however erroneous in
point of belief. Pre&s;s it home on them,
that there is nothing in nature to hinder
different &s;ects of Chri&s;tians from living
amicably together, more than different
<PB N="179" REF="187">
of philo&s;ophers, or of men who work
in different arts: e&s;pecially as the ar|ticles
of faith that di&s;tingui&s;h the&s;e &s;ects
are purely &s;peculative: they have no re|lation
to morals, nor any influence on
our conduct. Yet from the&s;e di&s;tinctions
have proceeded rancour and animo&s;ity,
as if our mo&s;t important concerns had
been at &s;take. In a different view, the ab|&s;urdity
appears &s;till more glaring. The&s;e
articles, the greater part at lea&s;t, relate to
&s;ubjects beyond the reach of human un|der&s;tanding;
&s;o that no man can &s;ay
whether they are true or fal&s;e. The Al|mighty
by his works of creation has
made his wi&s;dom and benevolence mani|fe&s;t:
but he has not found it nece&s;&s;ary
to explain to his creatures the manner of
his exi&s;tence; and in all appearance the
manner of his exi&s;tence is beyond the
reach of our conceptions. Yet Athana|&s;ius,
that great champion for blind cre|dulity,
and who for that rea&s;on has been
<PB N="180" REF="188">
dubbed a &s;aint, handles the &s;ubject with
as great a&s;&s;urance of being in the right,
as if it had been revealed to him from
heaven. Certain it is, that the propo|&s;itions
laid down in his creed, are far be|yond
the reach of human knowledge. I
forbear to mention, that the greater part
of them, if they have any di&s;tinct mean|ing,
contradict common &s;en&s;e. And yet,
good God! what oceans of blood have
been &s;hed by the inveteracy of the ortho|dox
again&s;t the Arians, occa&s;ioned chiefly
by that very creed; men ma&s;&s;acring one
another without remor&s;e, and even with|out
pity&mdash;more cruel far than bea&s;ts of
prey, who never kill but for food. Per|&s;ecution
for the &s;ake of religion, would
have been entirely prevented by whole|&s;ome
education, in&s;tilling into the minds
of young people, that difference in opi|nion
is no ju&s;t cau&s;e of di&s;cord; and
that different &s;ects may live amicably to|gether.
In a word, neglect no opportu|nity
<PB N="181" REF="189">
to impre&s;s on the mind of your pu|pils,
that religion is given for our good;
and that no religion can be true that
tends to di&s;turb the peace of &s;ociety.</P>

<P>THAT the &s;en&s;e of Deity is innate
has been &s;hewn el&s;ewhere. The
pre&s;ent enquiry is how to unfold it.</P>
<P>THE perception of our own exi&s;tence is
quickly followed by that of the exi&s;tence
of God; or rather, they grow up toge|ther.
The plea&s;ures of novelty and beauty
and grandeur are early felt; it &s;eems po&s;|&s;ible
to excite, even in the minds of chil|dren,
a reflection on the author of tho&s;e
plea&s;ures. Children are indebted to their
parents for food and clothes and other
<PB N="182" REF="190">
comforts, and they feel gratitude and at|tachment.
But who makes the &s;un to
ri&s;e, and the flowers to grow, and fruit to
ripen? They are the que&s;tions of children,
the &s;eed of an an&s;wer is in their own mind,
it only needs to be unfolded. By begin|ning
here, the fir&s;t idea of God is that of
a benevolent Being, and the fir&s;t devout
&s;entiments are tho&s;e of gratitude and ad|miration.</P>
<P>GLOOMY views of the Supreme Being,
and of the &s;ervice which he requires, have
the wor&s;t effect on the minds of youth.
The celebrated Boyle, when a young man,
vi&s;ited the &s;cenes of St Bruno's &s;olitude.
The &s;tories and pictures of that Saint o|verwhelmed
him with melancholy. The
mi&s;ery of his creatures &s;eemed to be the
&s;acrifice which God required. Accord|ing
to his own account, &startq;nothing but
the forbiddenne&s;s of &s;elf-di&s;patch pre|vented
his acting it.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="191">
IT is not meet to burden young minds
with religious in&s;truction. If it be con|veyed
in the form of a ta&s;k, it will &s;oon
grow irk&s;ome. If it con&s;i&s;t in definitions
of God and explanations, it will probably
amount to the knowledge of words. If
ab&s;tru&s;e and inadequate rea&s;onings be
u&s;ed, they will choke the good &s;eed which
you mean to cheri&s;h.</P>
<P>IN unfolding a truth which affects the
imagination and the heart, proper &s;ea&s;ons
mu&s;t be cho&s;en. When the &s;un ri&s;es
from the &s;ea, and di&s;pels the clouds, and
gilds the mountains, while birds &s;ing and
the air is fragrant; you may aid your
pupil's contemplation on that power
which daily renews our joy. In the &s;i|lence
and &s;olemnity of a &s;tarry night, his
thoughts a&s;cend to the Creator. While
it thunders, he readily perceives that re|verence
is due to the Almighty.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="192">
THERE are &s;ea&s;ons when the doctrine
of providence, and of immortality, a
branch of that doctrine, may be deeply
impre&s;&s;ed. Recoveries and e&s;capes and
deliverances are often experienced in
youth; when your pupil has experienced
any of the&s;e, with the &s;lighte&s;t aid he
will recogni&s;e a providence. Your di&s;ea&s;e
was extreme, the phy&s;ician gave no hope,
your companion was carried to the grave.
What power re&s;tored you to your &s;orrow|ing
friends? what gratitude is due to that
power? what love to tho&s;e friends who
took &s;o deep an intere&s;t in your afflic|tion?
You have e&s;caped an accident which
the next moment had proved fatal. Who
pre&s;erved your life? for what end was it
pre&s;erved?</P>
<P>Marcus Antoninus was thankful to pro|vidence
that his mother recovered from a
&s;ickne&s;s which had like to have cut her off
<PB N="185" REF="193">
in her youth. Such an interpo&s;ition duly
weighed, leaves a more powerful and
permanent impre&s;&s;ion than profound
rea&s;oning, and awakens a livelier grati|tude.
Tho&s;e who have cultivated piety,
and like Antoninus recorded its progre&s;s,
have all been touched with early interpo|&s;itions
of providence, and trea&s;ured them
up as memorials of Divine Goodne&s;s and
grounds of hope.</P>
<P>YOUTH &s;eldom pa&s;&s;es without a time
to weep. The death-bed of a parent or
of a young friend, melts the heart. Con|cern
and attachment grow as the hour
approaches. Death leaves him incon&s;o|lable.
Immortality is the &s;ource of con|&s;olation,
and now is the time to open it.
It accords with lively &s;orrow, which clings
to a departed friend, and dwells on the
thought of an everla&s;ting union. Divine
Goodne&s;s, which the &s;hadow of death
had veiled, &s;hines forth again. Were
<PB N="186" REF="194">
dying parents, like the late Lady Cath|cart,
to awaken a &s;en&s;e of God and im|mortality
in the minds of children, it
would make an indelible impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE doctrines of providence and a
future &s;tate, intere&s;t all mankind. Sy|&s;tems
of education which overlook them
are very deficient. The rea&s;onings of
Theologians and Sceptics, may have gi|ven
to an important &s;cience a di&s;coura|ging
a&s;pect. With them it may &s;till be
left to di&s;pute with Clarke and Dodwell,
and to trace the intricacies of Spinoza;
but in a &s;y&s;tem of education &s;uited to
man, his relation to God, with the &s;enti|ments
and duties founded on that relati|on,
is an e&s;&s;ential branch. The &s;teps by
which your pupil advances in knowledge,
all lead to the Creator. By giving them
this direction, improvement and delight
will mingle.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2">
<PB N="187" REF="195">
<HEAD>ART. II.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is an early tendency to con|template
the works of nature, and
to enquire. If the inclination and ca|pacity
of youth were con&s;ulted, natural
hi&s;tory would be the fir&s;t branch of edu|cation.
On this &s;ubject, the pupil is in|troduced
with ea&s;e and plea&s;ure to indu|&s;try
and thought. Curio&s;ity is gratified
and excited by turns. A way of know|ledge
is opened in the de&s;ert, and a path
in the deep waters. Final cau&s;es are per|ceived,
and views of wi&s;dom open. He
is introduced to communion with God.</P>
<P>MUCH depends on the method in
which natural hi&s;tory is taught. The
&s;ophi&s;try of materiali&s;m darkens the un|der&s;tanding,
and chills the heart, and
damps the ardour of pur&s;uit. The &s;en&s;e
of Deity, which the mere detail of facts
<PB N="188" REF="196">
would cheri&s;h, is bla&s;ted by cold and
captious rea&s;oning; the re&s;ult is doubt
and melancholy, perhaps indolence and
&s;en&s;uality. But when marks of wi&s;e and
beneficent de&s;ign are pointed out, the de|tail
of facts becomes more intere&s;ting.
Rea&s;on is exerci&s;ed. Admiration is felt.
The heart warms at every new pro&s;pect
of benevolence. Fre&s;h ardour kindles in
a pur&s;uit by which the highe&s;t feelings
of the mind are gratified.</P>
<P>IF the inclination and capacity of the
pupil be &s;till con&s;ulted, experimental phi|lo&s;ophy
is the next &s;tep. It contributes
to the arts of life, and it may likewi&s;e
contribute to the knowledge of God. &startq;It
gives a reli&s;h, as Mr Boyle ob&s;erved
and felt, for ab&s;tract truths which do
not gratify ambition, &s;en&s;uality or low
intere&s;ts.&endq; The laws of nature &s;uppo&s;e
a Lawgiver. The properties of body,
&s;ubjected to the power and ingenuity and
<PB N="189" REF="197">
u&s;e of man, lead to the Author of the&s;e
properties and of this &s;ubjection. The
doctrine of cau&s;e and effect is explained.
The metaphy&s;ical du&s;t is ea&s;ily wiped off.
With intuitive conviction, the mind re&s;ts
in a fir&s;t cau&s;e, independent and &s;elf-ex|i&s;tent.
It re&s;ts in &s;ilent awe. The expla|nations
of &s;choolmen are bla&s;phemy.</P>
<P>THE &s;ciences acquire new importance
and dignity, and reflect new honour on
their profe&s;&s;ors, as they di&s;pel &s;uper&s;ti|tion
and e&s;tabli&s;h faith in the perfections
and providence of God. &startq;Our views of
nature,&endq; &s;ays M'Laurin, an eminent
and enlightened teacher, &startq;however im|perfect,
&s;erve to repre&s;ent to us in the
mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible manner, that mighty
power which prevails throughout, act|ing
with a force and efficacy that ap|pears
to &s;uffer no diminution from the
greate&s;t di&s;tances of &s;pace or intervals
of time; and that wi&s;dom which we
<PB N="190" REF="198">
&s;ee equally di&s;played in the exqui&s;ite
&s;tructure and ju&s;t motions of the great|e&s;t
and &s;ubtile&s;t parts. The&s;e, with
perfect goodne&s;s by which they are
evidently directed, con&s;titute the &s;u|preme
object of the &s;peculations of a
philo&s;opher, who, while he contem|plates
and admires &s;o excellent a &s;y&s;tem,
cannot but be him&s;elf excited and ani|mated
to corre&s;pond with the general
harmony of nature.&endq; Sir I&s;aac New|ton
concludes his principal works with
thoughts of God, &s;ublime in proportion
to the objects which filled his mind, and
the clearne&s;s with which he viewed them.
In a late E&s;&s;ay on Gravitation, an idea is
pre&s;ented of &s;ome centre of the univer&s;e
un&s;peakably remote, round which the
&s;un and &s;tars may gravitate. After &s;up|porting
the hypothe&s;is by analogy, and
by the change of place actually ob&s;erved
in many &s;tars, it thus concludes, &startq;What
an a&s;toni&s;hing thing is this when con|&s;idered
<PB N="191" REF="199">
in its proper and full extent!
It &s;eems the voice of nature reaching
from the uttermo&s;t heavens, inviting
us to enlarge and elevate our views.&endq;</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3">
<HEAD>ART. III.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the knowledge of external
things, the mind is conducted to
the knowledge of it&s;elf: a brighter di&s;|play
of the Deity opens. Human wi&s;|dom
appears in mechanical arts, but &s;till
more in the arts of government. The
laws of motion in matter, and of in&s;tinct
in brutes are &s;uited to their &s;ubjects; but
the laws which regulate a mind capable
of thinking and chu&s;ing, lead to more
profound re&s;earches. The labour is dif|ficult,
but the recompen&s;e is great. In
tracing the&s;e laws we di&s;cover the end of
our creation, and the means of attaining
it. We di&s;cover hidden trea&s;ures of Di|vine
<PB N="192" REF="200">
Wi&s;dom, in a &s;ubject of higher dig|nity
and more exqui&s;ite workman&s;hip,
than the material world. We feel a prin|ciple
of ju&s;tice and kind affection, which
aid our conceptions of the Divine Ju&s;tice
and Benevolence. Some of the pa&s;&s;ions
find an object in God; and moral excel|lence
attracts the heart.</P>
<P>THE principles of ta&s;te are the ea&s;ie&s;t
and mo&s;t plea&s;ant branch of human na|ture;
and with them, perhaps, it is fitte&s;t
to begin. The plea&s;ures of imagination
are reli&s;hed in youth: as their &s;ources
are traced with the means of purifying
them, they acquire a new reli&s;h. Means
fitted to their ends in &s;o complicated a
machine as man, di&s;play profound wi&s;|dom:
when the&s;e ends are &s;o many delici|ous
plea&s;ures, they renew the impre&s;&s;ion
of Divine Benevolence. The benevolence
of God is the foundation of piety, and
it cannot be laid too deep. While the
<PB N="193" REF="201">
plea&s;ures of imagination are enjoyed,
gratitude may at times be rou&s;ed. Many
of the&s;e plea&s;ures accord with devotion,
and ri&s;e in the exerci&s;e of it to their
highe&s;t note. Great and awful and im|mea&s;urable
objects are &s;ublime; as they
rai&s;e the thoughts to God, the mind
&s;wells with &s;till more exalted plea&s;ure.
The enthu&s;ia&s;m of poetry is felt, and the
fire of devotion burns. Hymns to the
Creator were early expre&s;&s;ions of piety
among men, and piety may &s;till be che|ri&s;hed
in early years by &s;ongs of prai&s;e.</P>
<P>LAWS which regulate conduct, are
more important than tho&s;e by which
plea&s;ure is di&s;pen&s;ed.</P>
<P>KIND affections &s;pring up in youth;
it is the &s;ea&s;on for rearing the amiable
virtues. Plea&s;ure accompanies every act
of goodne&s;s; the gratitude which it ex|cites,
and the prai&s;e which it attracts,
<PB N="194" REF="202">
heighten that plea&s;ure; devotion purifies
and exalts it. Benevolence, which is a|nimated
by views of Divine Benevolence,
and works together with God, is pure
and permanent; it is proof again&s;t in|gratitud&egrave;
and unmerited reproach.</P>
<P>WHILE ju&s;tice is explained, the obliga|tion
is felt, and the &s;anctions which en|force
it. Human laws are contemplated
as a part of God's admini&s;tration, found|ed
on the &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice which he has
given, inflicting puni&s;hments which that
&s;en&s;e approves, and e&s;tabli&s;hing order in
&s;ociety. So far the pro&s;pect is bright.
But your pupil mu&s;t be in&s;tructed in the
di&s;order which actually prevails, the im|perfection
of human laws, the partiality
and deceivablene&s;s of judges, the tri|umphs
of iniquity. A cloud gathers on
the pro&s;pect. Indignation ri&s;es at the
view of oppre&s;&s;ion, and &s;ympathy with
the oppre&s;&s;ed, and an appeal to that Being
<PB N="195" REF="203">
who made man upright. Immortality,
opened through the vale of death, opens
again through the vale of iniquity.</P>
<P>IF difficulties occur in comparing the
ju&s;tice of God with his benevolence, the
following hints by Muralt are &s;ubmit|ted.</P>
<P>&startq;THE faculties with which man is
endowed, tend, when properly exer|ci&s;ed,
to the perfection of his nature.
When they are turned from their true
de&s;tination, di&s;order en&s;ues, great in
proportion to the excellence of the fa|culties
perverted. The order which
&s;ub&s;i&s;ts among the members of the
body, is e&s;&s;ential not only to its per|fection,
but to its happine&s;s. Di&s;or|der
in any member of the body, is no|tified
by pain; di&s;order in the facul|ties
of the mind, is in like manner no|tified
by pain of mind. Pain is the
<PB N="196" REF="204">
con&s;equence of di&s;order, the nece&s;&s;ary
unavoidable con&s;equence; were it
otherways, both body and mind would
go to ruin. Detach the idea of &s;eve|rity
from the ju&s;tice of God: were
creatures free from di&s;order, that &s;e|verity
would not exi&s;t. The e&s;&s;ential
ju&s;tice of God, is his approbation of
that order which renders intelligent
creatures happy; and of con&s;equence,
a di&s;approbation of the di&s;order which
renders them mi&s;erable. The &s;eeming
&s;everity of his ju&s;tice, is a con&s;tant and
pre&s;&s;ing call to return to happine&s;s, and
to that order with which it is nece&s;&s;a|rily
connected. The ju&s;tice, which
&s;eems &s;evere in its effects, is, in its prin|ciple,
goodne&s;s directed by wi&s;dom.
The principle by which he con&s;ents to
the pain of his creatures, is the &s;ame
by which he wills them to be happy.&endq;</P>
<P>REASON is of late growth: much mu&s;t
be done in the way of di&s;cipline before
<PB N="197" REF="205">
it can be applied: that di&s;cipline, how|ever,
&s;hould be adapted to rea&s;on, which
is hereafter to review it. Beware of con|veying
to your pupil religious principles
that will not &s;tand the te&s;t of enquiry;
when he comes to winnow them, the
wheat may fly off with the chaff. In a
dark age, prejudices friendly to virtue
may operate through life; but when light
ru&s;hes in, the foundation of piety and
virtue may be &s;haken. Era&s;mus ob&s;erved,
that all the reformers he was acquainted
with, became wor&s;e men than they were
before. The fir&s;t reformers, in renoun|cing
vernerable prejudices with which
the mo&s;t important truths were mingled,
underwent a &s;evere trial; nor is it much
to be wondered at, if in breaking the
bands of &s;uper&s;tition, the bands of love
were loo&s;ed. The children of prote&s;tants
acknowledged no authority but &s;cripture,
and they e&s;caped the trial of their fa|thers.
In the progre&s;s of enquiry, &s;crip|ture
<PB N="198" REF="206">
came to be judged by rea&s;on, the
moral &s;en&s;e, and the &s;en&s;e of Deity. In
this &s;tate of things, it &s;eems prudent
to begin with incontrovertible e&s;&s;ential
truths, and to prepare and cultivate rea|&s;on

<HEAD>ART. IV.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the &s;en&s;e of Deity is un|folded

it is the religion of our fathers: it has a
&s;hew of evidence: if it be true, it is a
truth of high concern.</P>
<P>MANY of the objections to Chri&s;tianity
are owing to mi&s;repre&s;entations of it. Let

<P>Is the appointment of a Mediator ana|logous
to the ways of Providence, ex|pre&s;&s;ive
of Divine Conde&s;cen&s;ion, and
&s;uited to human nature? Is it con&s;oling
to the heart under a &s;en&s;e of guilt, to be
a&s;&s;ured of pardon? Does moral excel|lence
made perfect by &s;uffering, &s;eem to
be a &s;acrifice which God will accept? Is
it natural to the mind of man, to feel ad|miration

excellence, and yield to its transforming

<P>WHILE other pa&s;&s;ions are &s;pring|ing

claim a &s;hare in that attention.</P>
<P>THE works of God in&s;pire humility.
When we look up to the heavenly bodies,

<P>PERFECT innocence is not the portion
of mortality. Even in worthy pur&s;uits
the judgment may err, and in the exer|ci&s;e
of right affections the heart may
wander. In youth a pa&s;&s;ion may break
its bounds, and for a moment lay wa&s;te
the &s;oul. Remor&s;e is felt. Under its
&s;evere and awful pre&s;&s;ure, the &s;oul re|turns
<PB N="203" REF="211">
to God, and melts in penitential
&s;orrow. The peace which begins to
dawn, is a token of the Divine compa&s;|&s;ion.
The fruits of this exerci&s;e are a
lively &s;en&s;e of the danger of guilt, the
humblene&s;s of mind which becomes an
imperfect creature, and &s;ympathy with
tho&s;e who are in the &s;ame imperfect
&s;tate. The devout act pa&s;&s;es in retire|ment
betwixt the &s;oul and God; but the
fruits of it you may aid your young
friend to cultivate.</P>
<P>LOVE to God is excited and cheri&s;hed
by reflecting on his favours, and on the
goodne&s;s from whence they flow. Affec|tion
to a creature mu&s;t be limited, but
unmixed and unbounded goodne&s;s is the
object of unbounded affection. The heart
does not re&s;t in any human enjoyment,
but it re&s;ts in God; the object is ade|quate
and the enjoyment complete. Di|vine
love attracts the ardour and &s;en&s;i|bility
<PB N="204" REF="212">
of youth, and averts deba&s;ing pa&s;|&s;ions.</P>
<P>FIRST feelings are critical; by them
the character is often decided. Suppo&s;e
them &s;en&s;ual; how deep they &s;ink! how
often renewed by a polluted imagination,
and how fondly cheri&s;hed! They be|come
the hidden trea&s;ure of the heart,
to which it retires for a dark &s;elfi&s;h eva|ne&s;cent
joy: the pre&s;ence of the virtuous
cannot always &s;uppre&s;s them, nor the gate
of the &s;anctuary &s;hut them out. The path
of honour is for ever abandoned. Early
impre&s;&s;ions of piety in like manner take
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heart. The fir&s;t feelings
of devotion are remembered with delight.
God is &s;ought and he is found in the out|goings
of the morning, in delightful and
in awful &s;cenes, in the peace and in the
tumults of nations, in the inmo&s;t rece&s;|&s;es
of the &s;oul. When the mind is un|occupied,
it is drawn by love to the Fa|ther
<PB N="205" REF="213">
of mercies; when wonted &s;leep de|parts,
it is cheared by the returning &s;en&s;e
of his pre&s;ence. Love to God brightens
the &s;un&s;hine of pro&s;perity, and perfumes
with &s;weet incen&s;e the &s;acrifices which
are made to virtue. Every thing prai&s;e|worthy
is to be expected from the youth
who loves his Creator and acts as under
his eye.</P>
<P>DIVINE love has at times appeared in
a le&s;s inviting form. Unfeeling men, like
Dr Clarke, alarmed at the effects of en|thu&s;ia&s;m,
have denied the exi&s;tence of any
affection or pa&s;&s;ion of which God is the
object. Dr Butler, with a deeper in&s;ight
into human nature, in his &s;ermon on the
love of God, has e&s;tabli&s;hed the doctrine
on its true foundation. The &s;ucce&s;s of
enthu&s;ia&s;ts in ages of ignorance, and a|mong
the ignorant of the pre&s;ent age,
denotes a principle in the human mind
which corre&s;ponds to their in&s;tructions.
<PB N="206" REF="214">
It is a &s;acred principle, and de&s;erves to
be called forth and cheri&s;hed by the voice
of wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>MADAME Guyon taught the ladies of
Lewis the Fourteenth's degenerate Court
to love their Creator. The young yield|ed
to her per&s;ua&s;ive eloquence. She was
accu&s;ed of corrupting youth. Her de|fence
was in the &s;pirit of her in&s;tructions.
&startq;But the youth whom I have corrupted,
thou knowe&s;t, O my God, are full of
love to thee.&endq; The error of pure love,
if it mu&s;t be accounted an error, was yet
honourable for human nature. Like the
Stoic philo&s;ophy of old, it gave to the
world characters of &s;ublime and godlike
virtue. The names of St Francis de Sales
and Fenelon, like tho&s;e of Epictetus and
Antoninus, are lights &s;hining in a dark
place. In the mid&s;t of degeneracy they
are plea&s;ing memorials that God made

<P>POLITICS is the la&s;t branch of edu|cation.
The theory illu&s;trates the
principles of virtue and religion. The
&s;tudy of government and laws extends
the view of moral obligation; the &s;tu|dent
feels his relation to the public, and
meditates the duties of a citizen. The
hi&s;tory of nations, with the cau&s;es of
their ri&s;e and fall, extends the view of
Providence.</P>
<P>THE art of ri&s;ing in life is at la&s;t the
object. Concerning politics in this &s;en&s;e
Lord Bacon ob&s;erves, and perhaps the
ob&s;ervation was verified in him&s;elf, that
&startq;unle&s;s the young be in&s;tructed in re|ligious
and moral principles before
they proceed to politics, they are apt
to account moral differences unreal,
and to mea&s;ure all things by utility
and &s;ucce&s;s.&endq; In the career of am|bition,
<PB N="208" REF="216">
religion is a bulwark again&s;t &s;ur|rounding
temptation. Means &s;ugge&s;ted
by friends, and authori&s;ed by example, and
crowned with &s;ucce&s;s, and adorned with
Che&s;terfield's eloquence, are reviewed by
con&s;cience. Figure and fortune appear
light when laid in the balance with mo|de&s;ty
and uprightne&s;s. The &s;teps of a
religious youth may not be marked with
&s;hining honours, but they will never be
&s;tained by in&s;incerity. A &s;en&s;e of the
Divine pre&s;ence, become habitual and
plea&s;ant, in&s;ures uprightne&s;s.</P>
<P>IN Roman Catholic countries there are
hou&s;es of &s;piritual retreat, where the well
di&s;po&s;ed retire at times to commune with
God and with their own hearts. A pu|blic
in&s;titution of this kind may &s;eem
o&s;tentatious, but the &s;pirit of it is lau|dable.
In the bu&s;ie&s;t life a day may be
found for &s;acred &s;olitude. The youth
who has acquired a reli&s;h for the plea|&s;ures
<PB N="209" REF="217">
of devotion, yields his heart to
tho&s;e plea&s;ures. He views, at a proper
di&s;tance, the active life upon which he
has entered, and makes a true e&s;timate
of wealth and fame and pre-eminence.
He attends to his character as an ac|countable
being, and thinks of the time
when &s;ucce&s;s or di&s;appointment will fi|gure
le&s;s than the &s;teps by which they
arrived; when the plea&s;ure of &s;ucce&s;s
will be increa&s;ed by the honourable
means of attaining it, and the pain of
di&s;appointment le&s;&s;ened, becau&s;e nothing
di&s;honourable was done to avert it. The
particular duties of his &s;phere are review|ed:
if the review pre&s;ents imperfections,
he does not di&s;gui&s;e them to his own
mind, nor does he check humility. Un|der
the impre&s;&s;ion of divine goodne&s;s, he
learns to forgive him&s;elf, and to improve
the experience of former errors again&s;t
future temptation. Plans of u&s;efulne&s;s
are devi&s;ed, and kind affections cheri&s;h|ed.
<PB N="210" REF="218">
The beauties of virtue open in pro|&s;pect,
and, like a traveller refre&s;hed, he
&s;ets forward with alacrity.</P>
<P>THE intercour&s;e of friend&s;hip is a fur|ther
mean of uprightne&s;s. Young men
who&s;e mutual attachment is dignified by
principle, inve&s;tigate together the fair and
honourable cour&s;e: &s;elf-deceit is unveil|ed,
fal&s;e &s;hame is combated, and &s;elf|e&s;teem
is cheri&s;hed. Religious conver|&s;ation
in mixed company was fa&s;hionable
once, and it degenerated into hypocri&s;y;
it now retires to the privacy of friend|&s;hip,
and re&s;umes its charm. Truths
which elevate the &s;oul are canva&s;&s;ed and
pondered. Generous affections flow and
mingle. Exi&s;tence is felt to be a ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>ATTENDANCE on public wor&s;hip is a
decent avowal of piety. In the &s;olemn
a&s;&s;embly, the di&s;tinction of ranks is &s;u|&s;pended,
mutual benevolence kindles, and
<PB N="211" REF="219">
the fire of devotion burns: the laws of
God are heard with reverence. Though
the effects of &s;ocial wor&s;hip be not al|ways
felt, through the di&s;traction of the
wor&s;hipper, or the incapacity of tho&s;e
who mini&s;ter; &s;till one of ju&s;t and liberal

<P>THE opinion of Rou&s;&s;eau, that re|ligious
in&s;truction may be &s;afely
deferred till fifteen or even eighteen years
of age, has weight perhaps with &s;ome
parents and tutors, and contributes to
the neglect of early piety. Rou&s;&s;eau's
talents entitle him to a re&s;pectful hear|ing;
but on a &s;ubject &s;o important rea|&s;ons
ought to be weighed.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="220">
HE alleges that &startq;the idea which a
young mind forms of God is low and
unworthy of him.&endq; Will not this ar|gument
likewi&s;e conclude again&s;t teach|ing
religion to the old? The be&s;t idea
man can form of God is in many re&s;pects
low and unworthy of him. Still man is
made to know his Creator, and to act in
con&s;equence of that knowledge. In teach|ing
other &s;ciences, we are not di&s;couraged
tho' the learner's fir&s;t views be imperfect;
we gradually pre&s;ent &s;uch as are more
clear and exten&s;ive and &s;atisfying. It is
further to be con&s;idered, that in religion
the heart is concerned as much as the
under&s;tanding: affection may be &s;incere
while rea&s;on is feeble. The fir&s;t love of
an innocent heart, is a &s;acrifice of a &s;weet
favour.</P>
<P>HE alleges that &startq;it is better to have
no ideas of God than &s;uch as are in|jurious,&endq;
and thus accommodates a
<PB N="213" REF="221">
&s;aying of Plutarch to his argument, &startq;I
would rather be forgotten, than re|membered
as unju&s;t, envious, jealous,
and &s;o tyrannical as to exact more
than I gave means of accompli&s;hing.&endq;
It were certainly better to be ignorant of
God, than to think him unju&s;t and tyran|nical;
but is it then impo&s;&s;ible to con|vey
to a young mind an idea of divine
benevolence? Will not that idea be re|li&s;hed,
while plea&s;ure and hope combine
to make the morning of life &s;erene? Is
there a likelier mean of averting injurious
thoughts of God, than pre&s;enting &s;uch
as are ju&s;t? A mind enlightened with
views of the divine goodne&s;s, and touched
with the participation of it, is prepared
to meet with temporary evils, and to
di&s;cern goodne&s;s through the veil. Is a
mind kept in ignorance of God till the
ills of life ari&s;e and thicken in pro&s;pect,
equally well prepared?</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="222">
HE labours to prove, what nobody
doubts, that God will not puni&s;h invo|luntary
ignorance. But is there no blame
in voluntarily e&s;tranging the young from
piety? The importance of an early im|pre&s;&s;ion
is acknowledged; Rou&s;&s;eau ac|knowledged
and illu&s;trated it in the ca&s;e
of compa&s;&s;ion. If love to men be promo|ted
by exciting early and managing &s;kil|fully
&s;entiments of humanity; may not
love to God be promoted by exciting and
regulating devout &s;entiments, before the
plea&s;ures and cares of this life take po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
of the heart? Our author laments,
that plea&s;ures natural to the young and
&s;uited to their years are with-held; and
in the &s;pirit of philanthropy recommends
to parents, that at whatever period God
calls their children, they may not die
without having ta&s;ted happine&s;s. Upon
this principle, it &s;eems unkind to with|hold
the plea&s;ures of piety from the
young. Even in the dawn of rea&s;on, God
<PB N="215" REF="223">
is &s;een in his works, and felt in his fa|vours;
and well grounded hopes ari&s;e:
the young can ta&s;te the plea&s;ures of ad|miration,
and prai&s;e, and tru&s;t. Youth is
not exempted from calamity: when fa|ther
and mother for&s;ake them, they re|cogni&s;e
the providence of a Father in hea|ven.
Tho&s;e who mini&s;ter at death-bed,
know that the young are &s;u&s;ceptible of
divine con&s;olation; that under its &s;acred
influence they &s;uffer in patience, and
comfort their weeping parents, and die
in peace.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;ituations and events in
human life, which call forth the religious
principle: where it has been unculti|vated,
as is generally the ca&s;e in high
life, it appears in a forbidding form.
Lewis the Fourteenth's education was
neglected; his religion, when calamity
called it forth, was made up of abject &s;u|per&s;tition
and cruel bigotry, ruinous in
proportion to his power. The conver&s;ions
<PB N="216" REF="224">
of <HI>eclat</HI> as they are called in France, u&s;ually
con&s;i&s;t in a tran&s;ition from the chambers
of voluptuou&s;ne&s;s to the cells of St Ur&s;ula
or St Bruno. Even in more enlightened
countries, religion, operating late in an
untutored mind, exhibits o&s;tentatious
&s;anctity and blind credulity; con&s;cience,
which ought to direct, &s;ubmits to be di|rected,
&mdash;a depo&s;it too important to be en|tru&s;ted
with any creature. The religious
principle, when duly cultivated, is a &s;e|curity
again&s;t profanene&s;s on the one
hand, and fanatici&s;m on the other; it
brings forth the peaceable fruits of righte|ou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>IF religious in&s;truction be neglected
till the period marked by Rou&s;&s;eau, there
is the utmo&s;t rea&s;on to fear that it will
be for ever neglected. Your pupil mu&s;t

He profe&s;&s;es &startq;not to philo&s;ophi&s;e with

from which human prudence cannot ex|tricate,
under &s;orrow for which this world
yields no con&s;olation, and under the pangs

<P><PB N="218" REF="226">
SHORT forms of prayer are of u&s;e at
fir&s;t. The prayer which little children

<P>As children advance let the form be

<P>THE preparation of the heart is nece&s;|&s;ary.
It may be prepared by elevating
views of nature. &startq;The heavens declare

There is no &s;peech nor language where
their voice is not heard. Their awful
and maje&s;tic &s;ilence &s;peaks the language
of every people. It &s;peaks to the heart
of man.&endq; Before that powerful and
benign Maje&s;ty, let us bow and wor&s;hip.
Views of Providence may in like man|ner
prepare the heart. &startq;I wound and I
heal. I kill and I make alive.&endq; To that
Being, in who&s;e hand our life is, and who
alone can make us happy, let us devote
our&s;elves. Select pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture may
be u&s;ed to predi&s;po&s;e the heart. Prayer
degenerates into rote, if the heart be not
prepared.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="228">
WHILE you pray with and for your
children, the principles of devotion in
their minds unfold. In that &s;acred hour,
they feel them&s;elves the objects of tender

as well as they, that ble&s;&s;ings

<P>THE &s;tated and avowed exerci&s;e of de|votion,

of a good wife is fixed in his mind;
and he compares with it every young
woman he &s;ees. &startq;She is pretty, but has
&s;he good &s;en&s;e? She has &s;en&s;e, but is
&s;he well tempered? She dances ele|gantly,
or &s;ings with expre&s;&s;ion; but
is &s;he not vain of &s;uch trifles?&endq; Judg|ment
and &s;agacity will produce a deli|berate
choice: love will come with mar|riage;
and in that &s;tate it makes an illu&s;|trious
figure. After proper in&s;truction,
let the young man be at full liberty to
chu&s;e for him&s;elf. In looking about
<PB N="224" REF="232">
where to apply, he cannot be better di|rected,
than to a family where the parents
and children live in perfect harmony, and
are fond of one another. A young wo|man
of &s;uch a family, &s;eldom fails to
make a good wife.</P>
<P>BEAUTY commonly is the fir&s;t thing
that attracts; and yet ought rather to
be avoided in a wife. It is a danger|ous
property, tending to corrupt her
mind, though it &s;oon lo&s;es its influence
over the hu&s;band. A figure agreeable
and engaging, which in&s;pires affection
without the ebriety of love, is a much
&s;afer choice. The graces lo&s;e not their in|fluence
like beauty: at the end of thirty
years, a virtuous woman who makes an
agreeable companion, charms her hu&s;|band
perhaps more than at fir&s;t. The
compari&s;on of love to fire holds good in
one re&s;pect, that the fiercer it burns the
&s;ooner it is extingui&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="233">
FROM the making choice of a wife we
proceed to the making choice of a hu&s;|band.
Mothers and nur&s;es are conti|nually
talking of marriage to their fe|male
pupils, long before it is &s;ugge&s;ted
by nature; and it is always a great
e&s;tate, a fine coat, or a gay equipage that
is promi&s;ed. Such objects impre&s;&s;ed on
the mind of a child, will naturally bias
her to a wrong choice when &s;he grows
up. Let her never hear of marriage but as
proper for men and women: nature will
&s;ugge&s;t it to a young woman, perhaps
&s;ooner than &s;he is capable of making a
prudent choice. Neglect not at that time
to talk to her of a comfortable compa|nion
for life. Let her know, that &s;he will
be de&s;pi&s;ed if &s;he marry below her rank;
that happine&s;s however depends not on
dignity, nor on riches, but on the hu&s;|band's
good temper, &s;obriety, and in|du&s;ty,
joined with a competency. At
<PB N="226" REF="234">
the &s;ame time, to prevent a ra&s;h choice,
make it a frequent &s;ubject of conver|&s;ation,
that marriage is a hazardous &s;tep,
e&s;pecially for the female &s;ex, as an error
in chu&s;ing a hu&s;band admits of no reme|dy;
that the duties of a married woman
are burden&s;ome, the comforts not always
corre&s;ponding. Give her the hi&s;tory of
prudent women, who, not finding a
match to their liking, pa&s;s an ea&s;y inde|pendent
life, much regarded by their
friends and acquaintance. When a wo|man
has given up the thoughts of matri|mony,
what employment more reputable
can &s;he have, than the education of
young girls. Let her adopt for an heir
a female child: &s;he will &s;oon feel the af|fection
of a mother, e&s;pecially if &s;he make
a di&s;creet choice. A mother's affection
commences, it is true, with the birth of
her child; an affection however extreme|ly
&s;lender, compared with what &s;he feels
afterward from her watchful attention to
<PB N="227" REF="235">
its welfare, and from its &s;uitable returns
of gratitude. A woman who adopts a
promi&s;ing child, has in that re&s;pect every
advantage that a mother enjoys. At any
rate, the condition of a maiden lady with
an adopted daughter, cannot in any view
be thought inferior to that of a widow
left with one or more children. I have
the good fortune to be acquainted with
three maiden ladies in high e&s;teem, who
have each of them undertaken the charge
of a young orphan family. In all ap|pearance,
they live as happily as any wi|dow;
and a&s;&s;uredly more &s;o than many
a married woman. Let it not however
be thought, that I am endeavouring to
di&s;&s;uade young women from matrimony:
it would be a flagitious as well as fooli&s;h
attempt. My purpo&s;e only is to mode|rate
a too violent appetite for it.</P>
<P>BUT now, &s;uppo&s;ing a young woman
perfectly tractable, no means ought to
<PB N="228" REF="236">
be neglected for making her an u&s;eful
and agreeable companion in the matri|monial
&s;tate. To make a good hu&s;band,
is but one branch of a man's duty; but
it is the chief duty of a woman, to make
a good wife. To plea&s;e her hu&s;band, to
be a good oeconomi&s;t, and to educate
their children, are capital duties, each of
which requires much training. Nature
lays the foundation: diligence and &s;aga|city
in the conductor, will make a beau|tiful
&s;uper&s;tructure. The time a girl be|&s;tows
on her doll, is a progno&s;tic that
&s;he will be equally diligent about her
offspring.</P>
<P>WOMEN, de&s;tined by nature to be obe|dient,
ought to be di&s;ciplined early to
bear wrongs, without murmuring. This
is a hard le&s;&s;on; and yet it is nece&s;&s;ary
even for their own &s;ake: &s;ullenne&s;s or
peevi&s;hne&s;s may alienate the hu&s;band;
but tend not to &s;ooth his roughne&s;s, nor
<PB N="229" REF="237">
to moderate his impetuo&s;ity. Heaven
made women in&s;inuating, but not in or|der
to be cro&s;s: it made them feeble,
not in order to be imperious: it gave
them a &s;weet voice, not in order to &s;cold:
it did not give them beauty, in order to
disfigure it by anger.</P>
<P>BUT after all, has nature dealt &s;o par|tially
among her children, as to be&s;tow
on the one &s;ex ab&s;olute authority, leaving
nothing to the other but ab&s;olute &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion?
This indeed has the appearance
of great partiality. But let us ponder a
little.&mdash;Has a good woman no influence
over her hu&s;band? I an&s;wer, that that
very &s;imple virtue of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, can be
turned to good account. A man indeed
bears rule over his wife's per&s;on and con|duct:
his will is law. Providence how|ever
has provided her with means to
bear rule over his will. He governs by
law, &s;he by per&s;ua&s;ion. Nor can her influ|ence
<PB N="230" REF="238">
ever fail, if &s;upported by &s;weetne&s;s
of temper and zeal to make him happy.
Rou&s;&s;eau &s;ays charmingly, &startq;Hers is a
&s;overeignty founded on complacence
and addre&s;s: care&s;&s;es are her orders,
tears are her menaces. She governs in
the family as a mini&s;ter does in the &s;tate,
procuring commands to be laid on her,
for doing what &s;he inclines to do.&endq;</P>
<P>ALL beings are fitted by nature for
their &s;tation. Dome&s;tic concerns are the
province of the wife; and nature prompts
young women to qualify them&s;elves for
behaving well in that &s;tation: young
men never think of it. I know &s;everal
ladies of good under&s;tanding, who, at
the di&s;tance of weeks, can recal to me|mory
the particulars of every dinner they
had been invited to.</P>
<P>FROM a married woman engaged in
family concerns, a more &s;taid behaviour
<PB N="231" REF="239">
is expected, than from a young woman
before marriage; and con&s;equently a
greater &s;implicity of dre&s;s. Cornelia,
daughter of the great Scipio and mother
of the Gracchi, makes a figure in the
Roman &s;tory. She was vi&s;ited by a lady
of rank, who valued dre&s;s, and was re|marked
for an elegant toilet. Ob&s;erving
every thing palin in Cornelia's apart|ment,
&startq;Madam, &s;ays &s;he, I wi&s;h to &s;ee
your toilet, for it mu&s;t be &s;uperb.&endq;
Cornelia waved the &s;ubject till her chil|dren
came from &s;chool. &startq;The&s;e, my
good friend, are my ornaments, and
all I have for a toilet.&endq; Here is di&s;|played
pure nature in perfection. A girl
begins with her doll, then thinks of
adorning her own per&s;on. When &s;he is
married, her children become her dolls,
upon whom all her ta&s;te in dre&s;s is di&s;|played.</P>

<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="section">
<PB N="232" REF="240">
<HEAD>SECT. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">INSTRUCTIONS concerning the CULTURE
of the HEAD or UNDERSTANDING.</HEAD>
<P>IN planning the pre&s;ent work, I had
chiefly in view the culture of the heart;
prompted by two motives, fir&s;t, its &s;upe|rior
importance in the conduct of life;
next, its being in a great mea&s;ure over|looked
by writers upon education. The
culture of the under&s;tanding has been
&s;o amply di&s;played by excellent writers,
as to afford little matter for additions. As
however there is a certain period, during
which the culture of the head may be
carried on jointly with that of the heart,
the following hints are added relative to
the former, and preparatory to a more re|gular
cour&s;e of in&s;truction at &s;chool or
college.</P>
<P><HI>1&s;t,</HI> IN order to &s;mooth the road to
knowledge, it ought to be a chief concern
<PB N="233" REF="241">
in the preceptor, to promote in his pupils
an appetite for it. Give them examples
of men, who, from a low &s;tate, have by
learning arrived to great fame and ho|nour.
Let &s;uch examples be introdu|ced
occa&s;ionally, as a &s;ubject only of con|ver&s;ation.
Leave the application to the
young men; which will have a much
finer effect, than if the preceptor him&s;elf
&s;hould make the application.</P>
<P><HI>2d,</HI> BOYS ought &s;o far to be treated
like men, as to be informed before hand
of the benefit expected from what they
are ordered to do or to learn; which will
make them apply with double vigour.
Rou&s;&s;eau gives a lively example. His
<HI>Eleve,</HI> before he could read, got a writ|ten
invitation to a milk fea&s;t. He applied
to every per&s;on in the family, de&s;iring to
know the contents of the billet; but they
could not read, or pretended they could
not. The opportunity was lo&s;t; and from
<PB N="234" REF="242">
that moment he was re&s;tle&s;s till he was
taught to read.</P>
<P><HI>3d,</HI> IN teaching children any art, read|ing
for example, arithmetic, geography,
let it not be con&s;idered as a formal &s;tudy,
but as an amu&s;ement. Cut letters in
wood, give them names, &s;catter them,
and de&s;ire your <HI>Eleve</HI> to bring a particu|lar
letter. Let him try to imitate the
letter that is brought. Employ him to
count the number of panes in a window,
or of &s;hillings on a table. The&s;e hints
may be varied a thou&s;and ways, much
to his in&s;truction as well as amu&s;ement.
An agreeable way of learning geography,
is to have every county or kingdom by
it&s;elf pa&s;ted on wood. After &s;tudying the
general map, let your pupil try to join
the parts into one whole. A pack of
cards containing the names and pictures
of great men, with a &s;hort account of
them, will be an agreeable introduction
<PB N="235" REF="243">
to hi&s;tory. Cards may be &s;ucce&s;sfully
applied to many other purpo&s;es.</P>
<P><HI>4th,</HI> IT will facilitate the acquiring of
any art, to divide it into all its di&s;tinct
branches. Before a child is taught to
read, acquaint it with letters, next with
&s;yllables, and then with words. Fami|liariz&eacute;
your pupil with the Greek letters,
&s;o as to read Greek before you enter him
upon the meaning. Begin not to teach
Euclid, till he is well acquainted with
the different figures. In that view, em|ploy
him to in&s;cribe a circle in a &s;quare,
a triangle in a circle, and &s;o on. This
manual operation will be an enticing a|mu&s;ement:
and at the &s;ame time contri|bute
to make the demon&s;trations more
readily apprehended. Introduce him to
the knowledge of the terre&s;trial globe, &s;o
as to be able to point out every kingdom
and every city, before commencing a re|gular
cour&s;e of geography.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="244">
<HI>5th,</HI> A CONTINUAL attention to a &s;ingle
object, is the harde&s;t ta&s;k that can be
impo&s;ed on children. They are prone to
variety, which is peculiarly u&s;eful in
childhood, intended by nature for ac|quiring
ideas. When the thoughts of a
child begin to wander, change the &s;ub|ject.
Rebuke and correction, commonly
employed to force attention, fill the mind
with fear and concern, leaving no room
for other impre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P><HI>6th,</HI> EXERCISE your children to re|cite
&s;tories they have heard or read. It
improves their articulation, gives them
words at command, and tends to form
their &s;tile. This ought to be a frequent
occupation.</P>
<P><HI>7th,</HI> WHEN the faculty of rea&s;on begins
to make &s;ome figure, exerci&s;e your pupils
to draw morals from fables well cho&s;en.
Pre&s;ent to them fir&s;t fables of which the
moral is obvious and &s;triking. Proceed
<PB N="237" REF="245">
to fables the moral of which is le&s;s ob|vious.
The progre&s;s ought to be &s;low;
for to draw a proper moral, requires
much practice, or uncommon penetra|tion.
To facilitate that exerci&s;e, I recom|mend
a little book entitled, <HI>An Introduc|tion
to the Art of Thinking.</HI> Take a hint
al&s;o from the &s;ame book, to exerci&s;e your
pupils in conjecturing the exi&s;tence of un|known
facts, from facts that are known.
Take the following in&s;tance. Rou&s;&s;eau,
in his travels through England, ob&s;erving
a &s;mooth foot-path at the &s;ide of every
high road, conjectures that the Engli&s;h
mu&s;t be highly benevolent, becau&s;e they
provide comfortable roads for the low
people, who are neglected in every other
country.</P>
<P><HI>8th,</HI> To form a &s;tile in young per&s;ons of
twelve or thirteen, I &s;ugge&s;t the follow|ing
method. Take a long &s;entence in an
Engli&s;h author, Lord Bolinbroke, for in|&s;tance,
<PB N="238" REF="246">
who delights in long &s;entences;
reduce it to the &s;imple&s;t arrangement,
but &s;o as to be perfectly intelligible. Em|ploy
your pupil to arrange it in the be&s;t
order he can. After frequent trials with
the tutor's ob&s;ervations on them, I have
known much facility acquired in arrange|ment;
&s;entences &s;ometimes arranged, per|haps,
better than by the author him&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>9th,</HI> REGULAR hours at &s;chool of read|ing
and of diver&s;ion, have a woful effect.
Children, after a painful le&s;&s;on, are let
out to play. Their time, being circum|&s;cribed,
appears always too &s;hort. From
the height of amu&s;ement, they are forced
back to a dry le&s;&s;on. Can it be expected,
that in &s;uch a &s;tate of mind they will li|&s;ten
to &s;erious in&s;truction? Let them
play, let them fatigue them&s;elves: guard
only again&s;t &s;auntering. When &s;uffici|ently
tired, lead them back with a chear|ful
countenance to a le&s;&s;on, as a change
<PB N="239" REF="247">
of amu&s;ement: This is agreeable to hu|man
nature; and I hold it to be deci&s;ive
again&s;t a public &s;chool, till young per&s;ons
have acquired as much under&s;tanding as
to be convinced of the benefit of in&s;truc|tion,
without needing any collateral in|citement.
To torment young creatures
with Latin before that time, is likely to
make them abhor it. &startq;Id in primis
cavere opportebit, ne &s;tudia, qui amare
nondum poterit, oderit, et amaritudi|nem
&s;emel perceptam etiam ultra ru|des
annos reformidet<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Quintil. L. 1. C. 1.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P><HI>10th,</HI> THE in&s;tructions given above,
which can only be put in practice by a
private tutor, &s;hew the benefit, or rather
nece&s;&s;ity, of prolonging dome&s;tic educa|tion.
There is another rea&s;on &s;till more
cogent. A public &s;chool an&s;wers finely
for initiating young men in the manners
of the world, leading each to mind him|&s;elf
<PB N="240" REF="248">
and to guard again&s;t others. But is
there to be found in a public &s;chool, a
cen&s;or of manners, or a guardian of mo|rals?
The ma&s;ter concerns him&s;elf with
neither, except that his di&s;ciples behave
orderly when he is lecturing. Nor in|deed
is it po&s;&s;ible, that he can have con|&s;tantly
under his eye, &s;uch numbers as
are commonly at a public &s;chool. Hence
it is in a mea&s;ure e&s;&s;ential, that a young
man be well tutored in morals, at lea&s;t,
before he be left to him&s;elf, among a num|ber
of young men of very different di&s;|po&s;itions.
Virtue, decency, order, con|&s;i&s;t
mo&s;tly in re&s;traint, a negative which
makes no figure externally. It is the
bold &s;pirit, di&s;daining re&s;traint, that
makes a figure, is admired and followed.
Do parents apprehend no danger of their
&s;on being led a&s;tray at a public &s;chool?
Surely there is great danger, if he be not
&s;ufficiently prepared at home to re&s;i&s;t
temptation. In the Spectator, a young
<PB N="241" REF="249">
man is de&s;cribed, who &s;unk into vice by
not being able to pronounce the mono|&s;yllable
No. If you put any value on
morals, permit not your &s;on to enter a
public &s;chool, till he can pronounce with
a manly a&s;&s;urance the mono&s;yllable No.</P>
<P><HI>11th,</HI> EPISTLES to friends, or to favour|ites,
may be an amu&s;ement at a public
&s;chool as well as at home; and this a|mu&s;ement
may be encouraged as early
as young folks have learned to write to|lerably.
It is an agreeable amu&s;ement:
it improves their hand, and enures them
to expre&s;s their thoughts readily. When
they have learned the art of arranging
&s;entences as above, the improvement it
makes in their epi&s;tles delights them.</P>
<P><HI>12th,</HI> PEOPLE are indu&s;trious to lay up
a &s;tock of money for their children; but
few think of a more u&s;eful &s;tock, that of
ideas, though it can be procured in le&s;s
<PB N="242" REF="250">
time and with le&s;s labour. One who in
youth has collected &s;uch a &s;tock, who de|lights
in reading, and who has acquired
a habit of thinking and ob&s;erving, can
never pine for want of company. This
per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the magic art of rai&s;ing
the dead, and conver&s;ing familiarly with
the greate&s;t men of pa&s;t times. That
&s;ource of entertainment never dries up,
not even in old age. It is my &s;incere
opinion, that a common pea&s;ant enjoys
more felicity, than a man of fortune who&s;e
education has been neglected, who is &s;o ig|norant
as even to put no value on know|ledge,
who lives from hour to hour with|out
plan or pro&s;pect. It requires an extra|ordinary
genius to lead an idle life with
any degree of &s;atisfaction or e&s;teem. Com|pany
is not always in our power; and in
company a man makes but a &s;illy figure,
however plentiful his board is, if he has
nothing to &s;ay to his gue&s;ts. I have in
my eye a married couple, who began
with a large &s;tock of money; but no
<PB N="243" REF="251">
ideas except what were picked up occa&s;i|onally,
and con&s;equently of the &s;imple&s;t
kind. The &s;um of the man's learning
was a &s;mattering of Latin; and of the
woman's, Dryden's plays and two or
three French romances. With that &s;tock,
&s;canty as it was, they made a tolerable
&s;hift the fir&s;t years of their union. In
youth the world is new; and a flow of
&s;pirits is in it&s;elf enjoyment. The couple
are now old, in ea&s;y circum&s;tances, but
no fund of conver&s;ation, no ta&s;te for
books, nothing to do. Is it not a deplo|rable
ca&s;e, to be as it were on the brink
of happine&s;s, and yet entirely excluded
from it? The picture of &s;auntering Jack
and idle Joan, has a foundation in na|ture.</P>
<P><HI>13th,</HI> WITH re&s;pect to things proper to
be known by per&s;ons of condition, I re|commend
botany as a favourite, not what
is commonly taught, fit only for tho&s;e
<PB N="244" REF="252">
who intend to be profe&s;&s;ors, but the
powers and properties of plants, their
flowers, their fruit, their odour, their cul|tivation,
and in &s;hort every particular
that gives &s;atisfaction to a reflecting mind.
Married women of condition, cannot be
more agreeably employed, than in adorn|ing
their gardens and plea&s;ure grounds
with trees, &s;hrubs and flowers, which
bounteous nature produces in great va|riety
for our amu&s;ement. In this coun|try,
it is common to teach girls the harp|&s;ichord,
which &s;hows a pretty hand and a
nimble finger, without ever thinking
whether they have a genius for mu&s;ic,
or even an ear. It &s;erves indeed to fill a
gap in time, which &s;ome parents are at a
lo&s;s how otherwi&s;e to employ. By all
means, let their ta&s;te in mu&s;ic be im|proved,
if they have any, as well as in
painting, and in the other fine arts; but
I find no good rea&s;on for degrading
young women of condition, to be mu&s;i|cians
<PB N="245" REF="253">
more than painters. Such labori|ous
occupations, which con&s;ume much
time, are proper for tho&s;e only who
purpo&s;e to live by them. If, however,
a young woman of rank, be violently
bent on mu&s;ic or painting, it would be
cruel to re&s;train her; but I would yield
with reluctance. I am not of the &s;ame
opinion with re&s;pect to dancing. To be
a good player on the harp&s;ichord, requires
only a fine ear with per&s;everance: it is
no index of mental faculties. To dance
well, that is, to dance with grace and ex|pre&s;&s;ion,
a certain dignity of mind is re|qui&s;ite,
&s;upported by good &s;en&s;e; and
therefore, dancing well is an index of
the mind. I add, that elegant motions
in dancing, are communicated to walk|ing
and to every ge&s;ture. Much time,
however, in teaching a girl to dance, is
thrown away if &s;he have not a pregnant
genius: it is &s;ufficient that her motions
be made ea&s;y, to prevent being aukward.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="254">
<HI>14th,</HI> As in forming the two &s;exes, every
thing that tends to rival&s;hip is avoided,
nature ought to be copied in education.
You cannot exceed in di&s;playing to young
women human nature, its principles, its
pa&s;&s;ions, its faculties, its frailties; for by
that branch of knowledge, their conduct
is directed. Hi&s;tory al&s;o ought to be
their &s;tudy as well as that of the men.
A general knowledge of the &s;ciences and
of their utility, may be opened to them
hi&s;torically; becau&s;e it will enable them
to put a ju&s;t value on men of learning,
and withdraw them from fops and frib|lers.
But avoid the intricacies of philo|&s;ophy
and deep rea&s;oning; which would
tend to emulation, not to cordiality. A
woman of &s;en&s;e prudently educated,
makes a delicious companion to a man
of parts and knowledge. An ignorant
woman, if &s;he con&s;ult her peace of mind,
will accept of no man for a hu&s;band, but
who is ignorant like her&s;elf. She cannot
<PB N="247" REF="255">
be a companion for a man of knowledge;
and the &s;en&s;e of her inferiority renders
her unhappy. To people who labour for
bread, conver&s;ation is very little nece&s;|&s;ary,
but e&s;&s;ential to per&s;ons of rank;
and therefore, to unite in matrimony, a
man of ta&s;te and knowledge, with a &s;hal|low
female, is indeed woful. What fi|gure
will &s;uch a woman make in educa|ting
their common offspring; and how
mortifying mu&s;t it be to the man to have
his children ill educated? How can &s;he
train them to virtue when &s;he is ignorant
of the means? She knows of no means
but flattery or threats, which, far from
improving, render them in&s;olent or ti|mid.</P>
<P><HI>15th,</HI> IT is curious to ob&s;erve the pro|gre&s;s
of nature in be&s;towing knowledge.
Children learn words before they can
&s;peak; and when they can &s;peak, they
employ the&s;e words to explain what they
<PB N="248" REF="256">
want, ob&s;curely indeed for &s;ome time.
The full import of words being learned
by degrees, children expre&s;s them&s;elves
more and more accurately, as they ad|vance
towards maturity. There are how|ever
many words which are never per|fectly
under&s;tood by the generality, <HI>per|&s;onal
identity</HI> for example, <HI>chance, &s;pace.
Ta&s;te</HI> is a common word; and yet it
would puzzle many a good writer, to
give it a preci&s;e meaning. Were teach|ers
reduced to u&s;e no word but what
their pupils perfectly under&s;tand, in&s;truc|tion
could not begin before maturity of
age; and much later, if ever, with many.
Yet the celebrated Rou&s;&s;eau, overlooking
the progre&s;s of nature, maintains &s;tre|nuou&s;ly,
that in teaching children, no
word ought to be u&s;ed but what denotes
&s;omething they are acquainted with, that
is, &s;ome known object of the external
&s;en&s;es. With re&s;pect to the fable of the
fox and raven, he pronounces it ab&s;urd
<PB N="249" REF="257">
to mention the&s;e animals to a child, if it
has never &s;een them. I cannot &s;ub&s;cribe
to this opinion. A child may know that
a raven is a bird, and a fox a bea&s;t, with|out
having &s;een either. With that im|perfect
knowledge, however, the child
may under&s;tand the fable as well as if it
had &s;een both. People of Europe talk
familiarly of a lion, and with intel|ligence;
though few in that part of the
world ever &s;aw a lion. With re&s;pect to
geography, he ob&s;erves, that to point
out countries and towns in a map, is but
an imperfect way of teaching their true
po&s;ition. I grant; and would take a
better way if it were in my offer. Teach|ing,
however, by the map is far from
being u&s;ele&s;s: the pupil retains the po|&s;ition
of places as delineated there; and
when his faculties ripen, he readily trans|fers
that ideal po&s;ition from the map to
the globe of the earth. Rou&s;&s;eau de|clares
again&s;t teaching hi&s;tory, till young
<PB N="250" REF="258">
people are ripe for judging of cau&s;es and
con&s;equences. This, with many, would
prove a very late beginning. I am for
teaching hi&s;tory as &s;oon as the plain facts
can be comprehended; <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> becau&s;e it is
agreeable to children; and <HI>next,</HI> becau&s;e
it makes the facts known and ready for
u&s;e when people are able to judge of
cau&s;es and con&s;equences. Were our
author's doctrine to hold, a child &s;hould
never hear the name of God. That word
&s;ignifies a Being, of whom the mo&s;t pe|netrating
philo&s;opher has but an ob&s;cure
conception, which mu&s;t be &s;till more ob|&s;cure
in a child. It is proper however,
to give children an impre&s;&s;ion of a good
Being, who made us and protects us.
Their notion of a Deity, will purify as
they grow up.</P>
<P><HI>16th,</HI> SO far indeed I heartily agree with
Rou&s;&s;eau, that in teaching children, the
&s;imple&s;t words &s;hould be preferred, where
<PB N="251" REF="259">
it can be done. This concludes &s;till more
forcibly again&s;t employing general rules;
for they are above the comprehen&s;ion of
children, and in&s;truction goes on better
and more plea&s;antly without them. In
teaching a language, it is the univer&s;al
practice to begin with grammar, and to
do every thing by rule. I affirm this to
be a mo&s;t prepo&s;terous method. Gram|mar
is contrived for men, not for children.
Its natural place is between language and
logic: it ought to clo&s;e lectures on the
former, and to be the fir&s;t lectures on the
latter. It is a gro&s;s deception that a
language cannot be taught without rules.
A boy who is flogged into grammar|rules,
makes a &s;hift to apply them; but
he applies them by rote like a parrot.
Boys, for the knowledge they acquire of a
language, are not indebted to dry rules,
but to practice and ob&s;ervation. To this
day, I never think without &s;huddering of
Di&s;puter's grammar, which was my daily
<PB N="252" REF="260">
per&s;ecution during the mo&s;t important
period of life. Curio&s;ity, when I was
farther advanced in years, prompted me
to look into a book that had given me
&s;o much trouble. At this time, I under|&s;tood
the rules perfectly; and was a&s;to|ni&s;hed
that formerly they had been to
me words without meaning, which I had
been taught to apply mechanically, with|out
knowing how or why. Deplorable
it is, that young creatures &s;hould be &s;o
puni&s;hed without being guilty of any
fault&mdash;more than &s;ufficient to produce a
di&s;gu&s;t at learning, in&s;tead of promoting
it. Whence then the ab&s;urdity of per|&s;ecuting
boys with grammar-rules? Pride
is the cau&s;e. By u&s;ing rules, the teacher
of Latin flatters him&s;elf, that his profe&s;|&s;ion
equals in dignity that of logic and
mathematics, to which rules are e&s;&s;en|tial.
Even a humble teacher of Engli&s;h
to children four or five years old, will,
in &s;pite of common &s;en&s;e, make a figure
by his rules.</P>

<P>THE re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s of man has been
a topic of frequent declamation;
&startq;That after much thought and labour
in the pur&s;uit of any good, the acqui|&s;ition
be&s;tows but a momentary plea|&s;ure,
that the per&s;on becomes as re&s;t|le&s;s
as before, in the pur&s;uit of &s;ome
new object; and in &s;hort, that mo&s;t
men pa&s;s life in toil and anxiety, with|out
ever re&s;ting contented with what
they po&s;&s;e&s;s.&endq; Writers who have a
ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of religion, account for this
di&s;po&s;ition from the following principle,
<PB N="254" REF="262">
That this life is to us a time of trial,
to prepare for a better; and that hap|pine&s;s
in it, be&s;ide being incon&s;i&s;tent
with &s;uch a trial, would divert our
thoughts from a better life.&endq; Other
writers who have no thought but of our
pre&s;ent &s;tate, hold this di&s;po&s;ition to be a
gro&s;s imperfection in human beings,
made as it would appear not for their
own happine&s;s, but for &s;ome latent pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>As the tracing the ways of Providence
has always been to me a favourite &s;tudy,
I chearfully enter the li&s;ts again&s;t the wri|ters
la&s;t mentioned.</P>
<P>THERE may be animals which have
no enjoyment beyond re&s;t and food. But
man is not &s;o made. His con&s;titution
fits him for action; and he takes plea|&s;ure
in it. Did he take delight in re&s;t,
he would be an ab&s;urd being, con&s;ider|ing
<PB N="255" REF="263">
that this earth produces little for him
but what requires preparation; that raw
materials are furni&s;hed in plenty; but
that much labour is requi&s;ite to convert
them into food, cloathing, habitation.
I ob&s;erve further, that though the &s;eeds
of all valuable knowledge are originally
in us, yet that per&s;evring culture is ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to make them productive. What
then would man be in his pre&s;ent &s;tate,
were re&s;t his delight, his <HI>&s;ummum bonum?</HI></P>
<P>THUS, upon the activity of man, de|pend
all his comforts internal and ex|ternal.
&startq;Admitted, &s;ay my antagoni&s;ts.
Man is not blamed for his activity in
procuring the comforts of life; but
for his re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s in never being &s;a|tisfied
with his pre&s;ent comforts.&endq;</P>
<P>The&s;e writers certainly will not condemn
re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s in the lump: they will ap|prove
re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s in doing good; which
undoubtedly is one of the noble&s;t pro|perties
<PB N="256" REF="264">
that belong to human nature.
Re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s then, as far as reprehen&s;ible,
mu&s;t be confined to the &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ions.
Nor can all of the&s;e be comprehended;
for &s;urely there is no vice in re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s
to acquire fame, or the good will of
others. Re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s with regard to cor|poreal
enjoyments, I acknowledge to be
hurtful. Nor is it even there a defect in
the nature of man, but one of the perni|cious
con&s;equences of indulging &s;uch
enjoyments to exce&s;s. As they are the
lowe&s;t enjoyments of our nature, intem|perance
in them &s;oon produces &s;atiety
and di&s;gu&s;t; from which the luxurious
have no relief but by frequent change
of objects. This mi&s;erable re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s,
the fruit of intemperance in grovelling
plea&s;ures, will not find a &s;ingle votary.
Con&s;ider on the other hand a &s;ocial di&s;|po&s;ition.
A man of benevolence, who&s;e
happine&s;s chiefly con&s;i&s;ts in &s;erving
others, can never re&s;t &s;atisfied in his pre|&s;ent
<PB N="257" REF="265">
&s;tate: opportunities of doing good
daily occur, and employ him without end.
The more opulent he is, the more re&s;tle&s;s
he will be; becau&s;e opulence multiplies
his opportunities of doing good.</P>
<P>ACTIVITY is e&s;&s;ential to a &s;ocial be|ing:
to a &s;elfi&s;h being it is of no u&s;e,
after procuring the means of living. A
&s;elfi&s;h man, who by his opulence has all
the luxuries of life at command, and de|pendents
without number, has no occa|&s;ion
for activity. Hence it may fairly
be inferred, that were man de&s;tined by
providence to be entirely &s;elfi&s;h, he would
be di&s;po&s;ed by his con&s;titution to re&s;t,
and never would be active when he
could avoid it. The natural activity of
man therefore, is to me evidence, that
his Maker did not intend him to be pure|ly
a &s;elfi&s;h being.</P>
<P>THIS leads me to compare &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s
with benevolence. Selfi&s;hne&s;s in one in|&s;tance
<PB N="258" REF="266">
is not only innocent but laudable,
which is in coveting fame or good will.
The&s;e appetites however prevail but in
few, compared with the appetite for cor|poreal
plea&s;ures. It would be too exten|&s;ive
for the pre&s;ent e&s;&s;ay, to &s;how all the
advantages of benevolence over corporeal
plea&s;ures; that no corporeal plea&s;ure con|tributes
&s;o much to happine&s;s as the ex|erci&s;e
of benevolence; that the latter
rai&s;es a man in his own e&s;teem and in
that of others, whereas the former le&s;&s;ens
him in both. I &s;hall therefore confine
my&s;elf to one particular, which is the &s;u|perior
advantage of benevolence from its
permanency. Corporeal plea&s;ures, how|ever
&s;weet at fir&s;t, &s;oon lo&s;e their reli&s;h;
nor is there any way to prevent &s;atiety,
but change of objects. This is &s;trongly
exemplified in that low commerce be|tween
the &s;exes, founded on the carnal
appetite merely; which requires new
objects daily, becau&s;e the plea&s;ure of
<PB N="259" REF="267">
the &s;ame object is &s;oon at an end. Nor
can novelty long &s;upport this grovelling
appetite: frequent repetition without
waiting the calls of nature, blunts the
charm of novelty: every new object ap|pears
le&s;s and le&s;s new; and that charm
vani&s;hes long before middle age. This &s;ug|ge&s;ts
a &s;econd inference, that were man
intended to be entirely a &s;elfish being,
his life would be made much &s;horter than
it is. Benevolence on the contrary ac|quires
vigour by exerci&s;e, and the more
good we do, the more we are inclined to
do. The &s;atisfaction it affords is not
blunted even by old age, which blunts
every other enjoyment. The body may
decay, but the plea&s;ure of doing good,
when habitual, continues the &s;ame, even
to the la&s;t moment of exi&s;tence<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">With re&s;pect to tho&s;e who are in con&s;tant pur|&s;uit of plea&s;ure, which as con&s;tantly e&s;capes their gra&s;p, a writer of &s;pirit exclaims as follows. &startq;At that rate poverty is the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing of life. By delaying gratification of the appetites, it makes gratification a plea&s;ure. It keeps the &s;oul awake with expectation, and enlivens it with hope. In a word, the reputed wretch, who begs from door to door, is really happier than the rich man who has every plea&s;ure in his power; and yet, from the ea&s;ine&s;s of attainment, feels no gratification.&endq;</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="268">
LISTEN to this doctrine ye parents and
tutors: and ha&s;ten to in&s;pire tho&s;e under
your care with affection to their fellow
creatures. Let them know, that even
for their own &s;ake, benevolence is great|ly
preferable to &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s. This le&s;&s;on, it
is true, may be gathered in the commerce
of the world; but if the mind be left
without in&s;truction, it is very apt to ac|quire
a &s;elfi&s;h bias; and then the le&s;&s;on
comes too late. Teach your pupils &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion
to &s;uperiors, and civility and
complai&s;ance to inferiors. Let acts of
benevolence be their daily exerci&s;e. Give
them money for charity, and accu&s;tom
them to account how it has been laid out.
Let them vi&s;it the &s;ick, and carry to them
<PB N="261" REF="269">
what is proper for their relief. Exhort
them to be kindly to their companions,
and to be ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in di&s;tre&s;s.
Convince them, that in &s;uch conduct
they will find much more gratification,
than in yielding to &s;elfi&s;h appetites. Be|nevolence
thus cultivated in children,
becomes, in time, their ruling pa&s;&s;ion:
they will be the delight of their parents,
a ble&s;&s;ing to their relations, and the ob|jects
of univer&s;al good will and e&s;teem.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">OPINION and BELIEF le&s;s influenced by

<P>IN the reign of Tiberius Cae&s;ar, Severus
Coecina moved to have a law enacted,
that no Roman governor &s;hould carry his
wife with him to his province. He &s;aid,
&startq;that he had a wife and &s;ix children, and
that he always left them at home, tho',
<PB N="262" REF="270">
in different provinces, he had borne
arms for the republic more than
forty years; that by &s;uch attendants
peace degenerates into luxury, war in|to
confu&s;ion, and a Roman army into
a mob of barbarians; that not only
weak and unequal to labour is the fe|male
&s;ex, but, where not re&s;trained,
cruel and greedy of power: that they
love to range among the &s;oldiers and
to cabal with the leaders.&endq; He in|treated
the &s;enate to con&s;ider the danger|ous
tendency of bribery and corruption
in a governor. &startq;Yet how often, added
he, have their wives been noted for
the&s;e crimes! The~ infamous of every
province cling to them for refuge;
which e&s;tabli&s;hes in effect two gover|nors
in a province, and oppo&s;ite in|tere&s;ts.
The paying court to the wives
of magi&s;trates, is prohibited by our
old laws; and as the&s;e &s;eem now to
be in oblivion; not &s;atisfied to domi|neer
<PB N="263" REF="271">
at home, they infe&s;t the courts of
ju&s;tice, armies, and the &s;enate.&endq; Coecina
ended without applau&s;e: a confu&s;ed mur|mur
&s;pread through the a&s;&s;embly. Vale|rius
Me&s;&s;alinus an&s;wered thus. &startq;Our
forefathers, involved in perpetual war,
and reduced frequently to defend the
gates of Rome, were rigid in di&s;cipline,
and au&s;tere in manners. We have now
no enemy to fear: victorious Rome is
the &s;eat of empire. Peaceable times
produce kindly manners; and our old
cu&s;toms have yielded to gentlene&s;s and
humanity. Society between hu&s;band
and wife is founded on nature; and
nature ought to prevail. Again&s;t the
enemy let us march with nothing but
our arms: returning victorious, why
&s;hould we be denied the reward of a
comfortable companion? Some women
are prone to avarice or ambition; and
&s;o are &s;ome men. Is the latter a good
rea&s;on for leaving our provinces with|out
<PB N="264" REF="272">
governors? Some men have been
corrupted by their wives; but are all

the fault to be in the hu&s;|band,

it of no moment, that by the projected

their own luxury, and to the lu&s;t of
profligate men? As the hu&s;band's pre|&s;ence
is no more than &s;ufficient to keep

I need not inform the reader that Taci|tus

This que&s;tion is, in appearance, deeply
political; and yet I violently &s;u&s;pect,
that the good of the &s;tate was not what
moved any of the &s;peakers. Imagine a
grave &s;enator with a long beard, &s;tand|ing
up and delivering what follows:
&startq;Gentlemen, each of you have in your

and is &s;urpri&s;ed, that any
&s;hould &s;tand out again&s;t conviction.
But I let you into a &s;ecret, that your
<PB N="266" REF="274">
arguments have not convinced even
your&s;elves. Your conviction is found|ed
upon character, not in the lea&s;t up|on

delighting in the commerce of women.
&mdash;You Coecina are old, crabbed, and

<P>IT is an ob&s;ervation univer&s;ally ad|mitted,
that in the conduct of life, men
are influenced more by pa&s;&s;ion and pre|judice
than by rea&s;on. A man who is
prone to &s;u&s;picion and di&s;tru&s;t, will be
jealous of his wife, and lock up every
thing from his &s;ervants. One addicted
to &s;ociety, has no exi&s;tence but in a
crowd. A per&s;on on the contrary of a
&s;olitary di&s;po&s;ition, retires to the moun|tains,
and declares war again&s;t the fea|thered

&s;ays he, to make war upon birds than

<PB N="267" REF="275">
cool who is always ob&s;equious to
rea&s;on: &s;uch a one would indeed be a
&s;ingular phaenomenon. Is there any
thing more common than a per&s;on going
a&s;tray, notwith&s;tanding the admonitions
of con&s;cience? Pa&s;&s;ion, it is true, does
not always appear &s;o openly. It fre|quently
by deep di&s;gui&s;e convinces us,
that our opinions and belief are found|ed
on &s;olid principles. Thus, being im|po&s;ed
on by pa&s;&s;ion under the ma&s;k of
rea&s;on, &s;elf-deceit is &s;pread through the
human race. The &s;tory above mention|ed,
is a noted in&s;tance; and &s;uch occur
every day. Show me a man who is fired
with ambition and love of power: you,
in vain, will attempt to convince him,
that Alexander was not a greater man
than Socrates. The opinions we form
of men and things, are the re&s;ult of af|fection
more than of evidence. An ad|vice
given by a man of figure, is highly
regarded: the &s;ame advice from one in
<PB N="268" REF="276">
low condition, is de&s;pi&s;ed or neglected.
A courageous per&s;on under-rates danger:
to the indolent the &s;lighte&s;t ob&s;tacle ap|pears
un&s;urmountable. A per&s;on of ve|racity,
relying on the veracity of others,
is ea&s;y of belief: where a man's veracity
is &s;o &s;upple as to bend to his intere&s;t, he
will be &s;u&s;picious of evidence and hard
of belief. Hence it is, that upon the be|nevolent
and humane, the arguments for
the goodne&s;s of the Deity, make a deep|er
impre&s;&s;ion, than on the &s;ullen and
moro&s;e. How important then is the
art of education, when upon it in a
great mea&s;ure depends, not only our be|haviour
and conduct; but even our
judgment and under&s;tanding, by which
chiefly we are elevated above the brute
creation! What can be more intere&s;ting
to human beings, than their conviction
of the exi&s;tence of a benevolent Deity,
their Maker, their Father, their Protec|tor?
Did parents &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider, that
<PB N="269" REF="277">
this conviction depends in &s;ome mea&s;ure
upon our di&s;po&s;ition, they would neglect
no opportunity of &s;weetning the temper
of their children, and improving their
benevolence. The time for &s;uch di&s;cip|line,
is confined to pupillage, when the
mind, like wax, is deeply &s;u&s;ceptible of
impre&s;&s;ions. At maturity, it becomes
inflexible like the body, and then culture
comes too late. Again&s;t pa&s;&s;ions and
prejudices that never have been control|led,
the mo&s;t cogent rea&s;ons &s;ignify little.
Arguments that accord with a man's ta&s;te
are greedily &s;wallowed, while the unpala|table
are rejected with di&s;gu&s;t. He is
therefore no adept in logic, who hopes to
convince others by arguments that have
weight with him&s;elf. He ought to &s;tudy
the temper of the per&s;on he would con|vince,
and urge the arguments that are
&s;uited to that temper. Dru&s;us was fond
of glory; and Coecina might have pre|vailed,
had he painted in lively colours,
<PB N="270" REF="278">
how glorious it would be to &s;acrifice
private plea&s;ures to the &s;ervice of the
&s;tate. But to urge that women are vici|ous
creatures, was not likely to make an
impre&s;&s;ion on Dru&s;us, who thought that
all women were hone&s;t becau&s;e his wife
was an angel.</P>
<P>SEEING then that our opinions and be|lief
depend greatly on pa&s;&s;ion and pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,
little upon rea&s;on, and not at
all upon will, how extravagant is the at|tempt
to force conviction by rewards
and puni&s;hments! Suppo&s;e that the law
had taken place prohibiting governors of
provinces to carry their wives along with
them; and that the Emperor had order|ed
all the world to be of his opinion, un|der
a grievous penalty. The order pro|bably
would have produced plenty of di&s;|&s;emblers,
but not a &s;ingle convert. To
make me believe under the terror of pu|ni&s;hment,
that the earth re&s;ts upon a huge
<PB N="271" REF="279">
elephant, or that an eclip&s;e pre&s;ages &s;ome
dire calamity, is no le&s;s ab&s;urd than an
endeavour to force a dwarf to be &s;ix feet
high, or a negro to have a white com|plexion.
What then &s;hall be thought of
per&s;ecution for difference of opinion in
points of faith? Often in peru&s;ing hi&s;to|ries
of per&s;ecution, I have &s;tarted up as
from &s;leep, and imagined that all the
while I had been dreaming. And yet in
fact that mon&s;ter Per&s;ecution, the off|&s;pring
of wild bigotry, has &s;hed more
blood than the fierce&s;t wars for power
and glory. Con&s;idering that to believe
is not in our power, more than to be hot
or cold, would one imagine it po&s;&s;ible,
that by mi&s;guided education, a rational
being can be made to believe the mo&s;t
palpable ab&s;urdities, as that bread and
wine, in direct contradiction to our &s;en&s;es,
are fle&s;h and blood; or that an old frail
man becomes infallible, the moment he
is elected a bi&s;hop, with a triple crown

then lies again&s;t tho&s;e parents, who, in|&s;tead

cannot live peaceably together, not
to &s;ay happily. Men join in &s;ociety for

The legi&s;lature has no concern, provided

of common &s;en&s;e, and as &s;uch is now
permitted every where. And yet, the
civil war in France between the Catho|lics

doctrine directly contrary. The Hugo|nots
pleaded for liberty of con&s;cience:
the Catholics, bitter enemies to it, in&s;i&s;ted
that none &s;hould be permitted to breathe

devote to de&s;truction one another for a

<P>THIS hi&s;tory &s;ugge&s;ted the following
thoughts upon uniformity in point of
opinion. Were it even practicable by
per&s;ecution or other means to produce
uniformity in opinion; the effect, far
from being de&s;ireable, would be di&s;mal.
All nature is full of variety; and the
mind of man corre&s;ponds to it, being
prone to variety, and delighting in it:
we feel as in fetters when long con|fined
to one object. A blended &s;cene of
woods, rivers, plains, mountains, men
walking, cattle grazing, a cottage here,
<PB N="276" REF="284">
a &s;teeple there, gives more plea&s;ure than
the &s;ky, the ocean, or any other &s;ingle
object, however grand. To a well di&s;|po&s;ed
mind it mu&s;t be equally entertain|ing,
to look down as it were from an e|minence,
upon the various tempers, &s;en|timents,
opinions, and pur&s;uits of hu|man
beings, tending to different ends,
cla&s;hing indeed and interfering, but upon
the whole con&s;piring to the general good.
&startq;Endle&s;s differences in temper, in ta&s;te,
and in mental faculties, that of rea&s;on
in particular, produce nece&s;&s;arily va|riety
in &s;entiment and in opinion. Can
God be di&s;plea&s;ed with &s;uch variety,
when it is his own work? He requires
no uniformity except with re&s;pect to
an upright mind and clear con&s;ci&egrave;nce,
which are indi&s;pen&s;able. Here opens
at the &s;ame time an illu&s;trious final
cau&s;e. Different features and different
expre&s;&s;ions of countenance in the hu|man
race, not only di&s;tingui&s;h one
<PB N="277" REF="285">
per&s;on from another, but promote &s;o|ciety,
by aiding us to chu&s;e a friend,

in opinion and &s;entiment, have
&s;till more beneficial effects: they rou&s;e
the attention, give exerci&s;e to the un|der&s;tanding,
and &s;harpen the rea&s;on|ing
faculty. With re&s;pect to religion
in particular, perfect uniformity, which
furni&s;hes no &s;ubject for thinking nor
for rea&s;oning, would produce languor
in divine wor&s;hip, and make us &s;ink
into cold indifference<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Sketches of the Hi&s;tory of Man, Edit. 2. Vol. 4. p. 427.</NOTE>.&endq; Is this a
doctrine that will ju&s;tify the oceans of
Chri&s;tian blood that have been &s;hed in
&s;upport of it? Saladin, one of the great|e&s;t
men that ever exi&s;ted, had, even in
the dark age of &s;uper&s;tition and bigotry,
very different notions. It is reported of
him, that in his latter-will, he ordered
large &s;ums to be di&s;tributed among the
<PB N="278" REF="286">
poor, without any di&s;tinction of Mahome|tans,
Jews, or Chri&s;tians; willing to have
it under&s;tood, that all men are brethren,
and that charity ought not to con&s;ider
what men believe, but what they &s;uffer.</P>
<P>BUT as the ab&s;urdity of expecting uni|formity
in point of religion &s;tands now
manife&s;t to all the world, I &s;hall confine
my &s;peculation to a more mild &s;ubject,
that will rai&s;e no indignation nor bad
humour. I begin with a&s;king this &s;imple
que&s;tion, What comfort would &s;ociety
afford, and conver&s;ation one of its chief
&s;upports, without variety in humour and
&s;entiment? Language would be u&s;ele&s;s,
and no uniting tie would remain but of
many hands to procure the nece&s;&s;ities of
animal life. Man would degenerate into
a brute&mdash;an illu&s;trious effect, worthy to
be enforced by fire and &s;word! Is this
to copy nature, which diver&s;ifies our
minds as much as our faces? What then
<PB N="279" REF="287">
&s;hall be thought of tho&s;e who in com|pany
are rude to every one who differs
from them? Is &s;uch behaviour more ex|cu&s;able
than to pull every one by the
no&s;e who&s;e face di&s;plea&s;es them? I can|not
illu&s;trate this topic more agreeably
than by a fable from a French author,
which I venture to put into the Engli&s;h
dre&s;s. &startq;Four friends there were, linked in
clo&s;e union. If they differed, it might
be in &s;entiment, but never in affection.
One was for the fair beauty, another for
the brown: one dealt in pro&s;e, another
reli&s;hed ver&s;e. Frequent were their de|bates,
but all tending to enliven con|ver&s;ation.
One day, a favourite topic
was brought upon the carpet. They
took &s;ides, grew keen, their blood was
up, nothing but noi&s;e in&s;tead of rea&s;on.
They parted in bad humour, &s;carce &s;en|&s;ible
of friend&s;hip to one another. After
having time to cool, Gentlemen, &s;ays
one of them, how happy for friends to
<PB N="280" REF="288">
be always of one mind: let us humbly
pray the gods for that ble&s;&s;ing. No
&s;ooner &s;aid than done. They marched
in a body to the temple of Apollo, and
pre&s;ented their &s;upplication. The god
inclining his ear, granted their re|que&s;t;
and in the twinkling of an eye,
they were perfectly uni&s;on. One made
an ob&s;ervation; all concurred. One
declared his opinion; the re&s;t gave a
nod. Good, &s;aid they! Farewel di&s;|putes,
we wi&s;h them a good-journey.
But behold! the charm of &s;ociety has
journeyed with them. No more amu|&s;ing
conver&s;ations, no beautiful reflec|tions,
no &s;hining thoughts, &s;truck out
by oppo&s;ition, that enlighten the mind
and chear the heart&mdash;Aye, is now the
only word. Friend&s;hip &s;ub&s;ided, indif|ference
took its place, and irk&s;ome be|came
the hours that formerly glided
&s;weetly along. Entire concord di&s;&s;olved
the union. Let men forbear mending
<PB N="281" REF="289">
the works of nature: we are well
enough as we are. Give all men the
&s;ame turn of mind, and you take away
the very &s;alt of &s;ociety. UNIFORMITY
brought furth: to her infant &s;he gave
the name of DISGUST.&endq;</P>
<P>SPECULATIONS like the pre&s;ent have
a tendency to bani&s;h every &s;ort of bi|gotry
in opinion. There are indeed cer|tain
opinions that ought to be univer|&s;al,
becau&s;e they are grafted on our na|ture.
I would per&s;ecute every opinion
contradictory to the following propo&s;i|tions,
that there is a Deity to whom we
owe gratitude and wor&s;hip; and that
there is a right and a wrong in actions,
which ought to regulate the conduct of
every human being. But I would per&s;e|cute
the opinions only, not the per&s;ons
who hold them: they are the objects of
pity, not of per&s;ecution. It is not in the
power of man to eradicate his opinions,
<PB N="282" REF="290">
more than his feelings or his appetites.
How ab&s;urd then is it to puni&s;h a man
for what he cannot help? There is not in
&s;cience a principle more evident than that
now mentioned, which every man mu&s;t
a&s;&s;ent to when fairly &s;tated. Yet &s;uch is
the influence of pa&s;&s;ion and prejudice, as
to have rendered that principle invisible
for many ages. What rancour, di&s;tre&s;s,
and bloodshed would have been prevented
even among Chri&s;tians, had the ab&s;urdity
of per&s;ecution been di&s;played to them in
open day light? This doctrine ought to
be carefully in&s;tilled into young minds,
hitherto free from bias. Let it be incul|cated
early into both &s;exes, that men are
not accountable for their opinions, more
than for their faces; and that a wry opi|nion,
even in matters of religion, is not the
&s;ubject of puni&s;hment, more than a wry
&s;hap. It is indeed a &s;ort of Herculean
labour, to eradicate notions that from in|fancy
have been held fundamental. But
<PB N="283" REF="291">
the mind of a child is white paper, ready
to receive any impre&s;&s;ion, good or bad.
This is the precious time for impre&s;&s;ions,
though too early for regular in&s;truction.
Let it not be trifled away, for it never
can be recalled. Good impre&s;&s;ions &s;tamp|ed
on the mind at that early age, &s;ink
deep and never are obliterated. There|fore,
neglect no opportunity of &s;etting
virtue and vice before your child, in their
proper colours: repeat to it often, that if
it be good, every per&s;on will love it; if
naughty, that every per&s;on will hate it;
and, in a word, that happine&s;s is the re|&s;ult
of virtue; mi&s;ery of vice. Give me

<P>I FINISH with ob&s;erving hi&s;torically,
that the art of Printing, among its other
advantages, has had an influence to era|dicate
per&s;ecution, by &s;preading every

no farther back than the beginning of
the pre&s;ent century, Mr Locke, even by
Prote&s;tants, was held gro&s;sly heterodox
for maintaining toleration. I am how|ever

there which he ought to guard
again&s;t. This is the true way,&endq; adds
<PB N="291" REF="299">
the good Bi&s;hop, &startq;of making our ene|mies
contribute to our good.&endq; If even
by &s;uch di&s;cipline &s;elf-partiality cannot
be totally eradicated, it may at lea&s;t be
concealed. In weighing my own opi|nion

if I &s;hould rack my invention to di&s;cover
what may be urged for him? Frequent
practice may po&s;&s;ibly abate my &s;elf-par|tiality.
This le&s;&s;on is with energy ex|pre&s;&s;ed
in the following golden rule,
&startq;Do as you would be done by.&endq;</P>
<P>PARTIALITY, checked or di&s;gui&s;ed
when entirely &s;elfi&s;h, is allowed full &s;cope
when our country is the object, or our
friends, or our religion. This &s;ort of
partiality is laudable, if it provoke not
our hatred again&s;t others. Excited by
partiality to their country, the old Ro|mans
were flaming patriots. But their
partiality was indulged to an ungene|rous
exce&s;s: they became proud, in&s;olent,
<PB N="292" REF="300">
intolerable, holding all other nations as
brutes and barbarians, the Greeks &s;carce|ly
excepted. Such partiality is not unju&s;t
only, but inexcu&s;able; being an infallible
&s;ymptom of a mean under&s;tanding and
of a contracted heart. It mu&s;t be a bad
frame of mind that &s;ets us at variance
with our fellow creatures, and foments
di&s;cord in&s;tead of &s;weetning &s;ociety.</P>
<P>PARTIALITY is thus a great enemy
to the affection we have for others; but
it is &s;till a greater enemy to the af|fection
we have for our&s;elves. Every
enmity we indulge, is to us a real mi&s;|fortune:
it &s;o far imbitters our chief
fund of happine&s;s, which con&s;i&s;ts in be|nevolence
and internal quiet. What then
mu&s;t he &s;uffer who hates every per&s;on
who differs from him in &s;entiment. Such
is the di&s;mal condition of the bigot in
religion, and factious man in the &s;tate,
objects however of pity more than of
aver&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="301">
BENEVOLENCE, the mo&s;t e&s;timable of
all principles, may by a wrong direction
of our pa&s;&s;ions, generate malevolence in
abundance. If we be taught to confine
our good will to our connections, and to
hold others at defiance; the man who
has from nature the greate&s;t &s;tock of be|nevolence,
becomes by that wrong bias
the mo&s;t zealous clan&s;man, and the mo&s;t
violent &s;tickler for a party; which in|flames
his aver&s;ion to others in propor|tion.
Thus the &s;pirit of faction, oppo|&s;ition,
and enmity, are by wrong educa|tion
rai&s;ed and fo&s;tered. Pictures of that
kind are far from being rare. Reflect
only on the &s;tate of this nation two cen|turies
ago. The old Roman patrioti&s;m,
which comprehended the whole Roman
people, was among us confined to our
tribe or clan. What inveteracy of one
tribe again&s;t another! Wor&s;e than lions
and tigers, which &s;pare their own kind,
we hunted one another down, and man
<PB N="294" REF="302">
became the mo&s;t formidable enemy of
man.</P>
<P>PEOPLE acquainted with their country|men
only, are apt to take up a prejudice
again&s;t the manners and cu&s;toms of other
nations; which tends to narrow the &s;pirit
of benevolence, and to le&s;&s;en their &s;ati&s;|faction
in the &s;ociety of their fellow crea|tures.
Liberal education, and travelling
with a view to in&s;truction, are the only
remedies. An incident recorded by He|rodotus
&s;ets in a &s;triking light the par|tiality
of a nation to its own cu&s;toms.
Darius king of Per&s;ia, having an army
compo&s;ed of different nations, demanded
of his Greek &s;oldiers what bribe would
prevail to make them eat the bodies of
their dead parents, as the Indians did.
It being an&s;wered, that nothing &s;hould
ever tempt them to commit a crime &s;o
atrocious, the Prince in their pre&s;ence
demanded of &s;ome Indians, what &s;um
<PB N="295" REF="303">
would tempt them to burn the bodies of
their parents after death. The Indians in|treated
the King to impo&s;e upon them any
thing le&s;s horrible. That this was rank
prejudice in the Indians, will be acknow|ledged
by every European. But were the
learned and poli&s;hed Greeks free from
that taint? We prefer the Greek man|ners
and cu&s;toms, which are familiar to
us, as their books make a capital branch
of a learned education. The laying of a
dead body on a funeral pile, appears to
us as natural as the laying of it in the
ground. But let us figure an Egyptian,
who, proud of his own country, never
gave him&s;elf the trouble to think of fo|reign
cu&s;toms. Embalming was a &s;acred
rite among that people, in order to pre|&s;erve
entire the bodies of their ance&s;tors:
the palaces of the dead were little le&s;s
&s;umptuous than of the living. What
notion would an Egyptian have of a
people, who&s;e practice he &s;hould be told
<PB N="296" REF="304">
it was, to throw their ance&s;tors into the
fire, or to let them rot in the earth? Yet
the &s;entiment of the &s;imple Indian was
the &s;ame. Being ignorant of the art of
embalming, the reverence he had for his
parents, prompted him to give them the
mo&s;t honourable grave in his power,
which was, to convert them into his own
&s;ub&s;tance. Brutality or &s;avagene&s;s it could
not be, when they expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch horror
at the Grecian mode. Their reverence
indeed for their parents mu&s;t have been
exce&s;&s;ive, when it was &s;ufficient to over|balance
the aver&s;ion that men as well
as other animals have to feed on their
own &s;pecies.</P>
<P>IF in this manner, young per&s;ons can
be trained to examine with candour the
manners and cu&s;toms of different nations,
they will find le&s;s rea&s;on than is common|ly
thought for preferring their own. Lead
them to reflect that the manners and
<PB N="297" REF="305">
cu&s;toms of nations, depend more on ac|cident
than on &s;ub&s;tantial cau&s;es. The
following is a ludicrous in&s;tance. A
long beard is among us a mark of gra|vity,
and commands re&s;pect; nor is it
without rea&s;on that we imagine this to be
a natural impre&s;&s;ion. Yet in the reign of
Francis I. of France, the grave judges of
the parliament of Paris were obliged to be
clo&s;e &s;haven. It was fa&s;hionable among
the courtiers and young beaux, to encou|rage
the beard and to cut it into &s;hapes.
The beard accordingly was at that time a
mark of levity, and therefore incon&s;i&s;tent
with the &s;olemn air of a judge.</P>
<P>As it is difficult to &s;ubdue partiality
when it has once got a &s;eat in the mind,
parents and tutors ought to give peculiar
attention, to pre&s;erve tho&s;e under their
care from the infection, noxious to them|&s;elves,
and noxious to others. Self-par|tiality
is in particular the parent of opi|niatrety;
<PB N="298" REF="306">
and young per&s;ons cannot have
a wor&s;e guide, in their commerce with
the world. Let them keep in mind, their
frequent mi&s;takes and frequent change
of &s;entiment. Candour in acknowledg|ing
error will gain them friends, more
certainly than the mere negative of never
having erred. Such candour will prevent
many a blu&s;h and irk&s;ome reflection,
which they are well acquainted with,
who cannot bear ever to be thought in
the wrong. A habit of ingenuity makes
a man a comfortable companion, and
fits him for every enjoyment of &s;ocial
life.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">ASSOCIATION of IDEAS.</HEAD>
<P>AMAN while awake is con&s;tantly
thinking. Ideas pa&s;s &s;ucce&s;&s;ively in
his mind without a gap or interval, form|ing
a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of related thoughts or
ideas, following one another according to
an e&s;tabli&s;hed law of nature. Our exter|nal
actions are in a great mea&s;ure govern|ed
by this &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, there being an in|timate
connection between thought and
action. Did our thoughts flow on, with|out
any mutual relation, and without any
relation to our external actions; we &s;hould
be hurried from thought to thought, and
from action to action, entirely at the
mercy of chance<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Elements of Critici&s;m, chap. 1.</NOTE>. It is of importance
in the education of youth, that this &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
be pre&s;erved entire, free from ill|&s;orted
ideas that have originally no rela|tion.
<PB N="300" REF="308">
Any unlucky bias by which un|related
ideas are conceived to be related,
is &s;ufficient to di&s;turb the regular cour&s;e
of actions, and to throw all into confu|&s;ion.
Nature is faithful in di&s;playing to
us things as they exi&s;t: our erroneous
conceptions are the re&s;ult of mi&s;guided
education, or of unhappy bia&s;&s;es con|tracted
during childhood. The har&s;h
treatment, for example, of a tender boy
by a mercile&s;s pedagogue, may produce
an intimate connection between &s;tudy
and di&s;tre&s;s, &s;o as to give an aver&s;ion to
books, never to be conquered. Inculcate
into a boy that his fate depends on the
motion of the planets: in &s;pite of rea&s;on,
he will be addicted to judicial a&s;trology.
There are men who, from &s;ome unlucky
impre&s;&s;ion made on them when children,
are as much afraid of a harmle&s;s cat as
of a fierce lion.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="309">
ONE of Mr. Locke's mo&s;t beautiful
chapters is upon a&s;&s;ociation of ideas. He
&s;hows the bad effects that certain ideas
unhappily connected or a&s;&s;ociated, have
upon the under&s;tanding and upon the
affections. &startq;The ideas, he ob&s;erves, of
goblins and &s;prights have really no
more to do with darkne&s;s than with
light; yet let but a fooli&s;h maid in|culcate
the&s;e on the mind of a child
and rai&s;e them there together, po&s;&s;ibly
he &s;hall never be able to &s;eparate them
&s;o long as he lives, but darkne&s;s &s;hall
ever after bring with it the&s;e frightful
ideas, and they &s;hall be &s;o joined that
he can no more bear the one than the
other.&endq; He proceeds to inform us,
that &s;ome &s;uch wrong and unnatural
combinations of ideas will be found to
e&s;tabli&s;h the irreconcileable oppo&s;ition
between different &s;ects of philo&s;ophy
and religion. That which thus captivates
rea&s;on and leads men of &s;incerity blind|fold
<PB N="302" REF="310">
from common &s;en&s;e, will, when
examined, be found to be &s;ome inde|pendent
ideas of no alliance to one
another, by education, cu&s;tom, and the
con&s;tant din of their party, &s;o coupled
in their mind that they always appear
together and can be no more &s;eparated
than if they were but one idea, and
they operate as if they were &s;o. This
gives &s;en&s;e to jargon, demon&s;tration to
ab&s;urdities, and con&s;i&s;tency to non&s;en&s;e,
and is the foundation of the greate&s;t,
I had almo&s;t &s;aid, of all the errors in
the world.&endq;</P>
<P>ASSOCIATION of ideas is a plentiful
&s;ource of &s;peculation. Mr Locke has gi|ven
a fine opening to the &s;ubject of ill
founded a&s;&s;ociations, and it de&s;erves well
to be pro&s;ecuted. It ought to be a chief
concern in the tutor to prevent in his pu|pil
an a&s;&s;ociation between truth and er|ror.
Truth is in great danger from &s;uch
<PB N="303" REF="311">
an a&s;&s;ociation: error cannot for ever
&s;tand its ground again&s;t rea&s;on; and if
it happen to be detected, the whole
tumbles down together like the cemented
parts of an old fabric. Thus it has fared
with the Chri&s;tian religion. The minds
of men were more en&s;laved by the Church
of Rome, than their bodies formerly by
the republic of Rome. Rea&s;on was bla&s;t|ed
in the bud; and people, through &s;u|per&s;tition
and bigotry, were prepared to
embrace every ab&s;urdity, as readily as
the mo&s;t &s;acred truths. The Romi&s;h
Church, taking advantage of this blind|ne&s;s,
&s;edulou&s;ly inculcated every doctrine
that tended to aggrandize their Dalai La|ma.
Its humble di&s;ciples made no dif|ficulty
to &s;wallow, even without a wry
face, the ranke&s;t ab&s;urdities, direct con|tradictions
not excepted, of which the
<HI>credo quia impo&s;&s;ibile e&s;t,</HI> is a notable in|&s;tance.
When upon the revival of arts
and &s;ciences, the light of rea&s;on began to
<PB N="304" REF="312">
dawn, and men ventured to think for
them&s;elves, how came it that the Church
of Rome was not apprehen&s;ive of its dan|ger?
It was &s;o accu&s;tomed to ab&s;olute
authority, as to have no dread of a re|bellion;
and after whole nations had
thrown off its yoke and proclaimed liber|ty
of con&s;cience, it was too late to think
of a remedy. So far Chri&s;tianity was a
gainer. But unhappily, the ab&s;urd doc|trines
grafted on revelation, have led
many well meaning per&s;ons to reject it
totally. Opinions a&s;&s;ociated by educa|tion
and confirmed by cu&s;tom, are, as
Mr Locke expre&s;&s;es it, &s;o coupled in the
mind, as not to be &s;eparated more than
if they were but one idea. Had the Chri|&s;tian
Revelation been pre&s;erved in its o|riginal
purity, promulgating immortality
to the world, with a di&s;tribution of re|wards
and puni&s;hments in a future &s;tate,
I am confident that it would have been
embraced by the wi&s;e&s;t and the be&s;t men,
<PB N="305" REF="313">
and adhered to by all without he&s;itation,
not even excepting &s;uch as may entertain
doubts or &s;cruples about the &s;trength of
the evidence.</P>
<P>To reject the Chri&s;tian Revelation, is
a &s;ad effect of ill a&s;&s;ociated opinions;
and yet &s;uch a&s;&s;ociation may have a &s;till
wor&s;e effect: it may produce vicious prac|tice,
much le&s;s tolerable than erroneous
principles. Many pious teachers a&s;&s;o|ciate
religion with a rigidity of manners
too &s;trict for any human being. What
are the con&s;equences to be expected from
&s;uch an a&s;&s;ociation? Young per&s;ons, mi|&s;erable
under &s;uch unnatural re&s;traint, &s;el|dom
fail of becoming either hypocrites
or open profligates. Our Saviour &s;ays,
&startq;My yoke is ea&s;y and my burden light.&endq;
The&s;e teachers maintain his yoke to be
galling and his burden heavy. Religion
is given us for our good, and in obeying
its precepts, there is great &s;atisfaction:
<PB N="306" REF="314">
&s;uch doctrines on the contrary render it
har&s;h and uncomfortable. Zealous di&s;|ciples
of <HI>Law upon Chri&s;tian perfection</HI> mu&s;t
be mi&s;erable in this life; and if they
break loo&s;e from their fetters, they mu&s;t
be mi&s;erable in the life to come.</P>
<P>OPULENCE confe&s;&s;edly, with luxury
and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s its concomitants, are the
mo&s;t obvious cau&s;es of the decay of pa|trioti&s;m
in Britain; but they are not the
only cau&s;es. An a&s;&s;ociation of repugnant
opinions has contributed to that woful
effect. Above a century ago, pa&s;&s;ive obe|dience
and non-re&s;i&s;tence to the arbitrary
will of a &s;ingle per&s;on, was a ruling prin|ciple
in politics: it was &s;ub&s;tituted to the
love of our country, and was carried to
as ridiculous an extreme as ever chival|ry
was. Rea&s;on at la&s;t prevailed, after
much oppo&s;ition: the ab&s;urdity of a
whole nation being &s;laves to a weak mor|tal,
remarkable perhaps for no valuable
<PB N="307" REF="315">
qualification, became apparent to all. It
was not difficult to fore&s;ee the con&s;e|quence:
down fell the whole fabric, the
&s;ound parts with the infirm. And men
now laugh currently at the ab&s;urd noti|ons
of their forefathers, without thinking
either of being patriots, or of being good
&s;ubjects.</P>
<P>THE a&s;&s;ociations above mentioned, are
but a few of the many that tend to mi&s;|lead
people from a ju&s;t way of thinking.
Formerly, this nation was over-run with
imaginary gho&s;ts and apparitions; for
&s;imple people give a ready ear to wonders;
and the more wonderful, the more firm
is their belief. A child in the nur&s;ery
li&s;tens greedily to a dreadful &s;tory. It
believes and trembles; and, if not of a
bold &s;pirit, is domineered by the im|pre&s;&s;ion
for life. I could name per&s;ons,
whom even the mo&s;t profound philo&s;o|phy
has not delivered from the fancied
<PB N="308" REF="316">
a&s;&s;ociation of terror with darkne&s;s. What
&s;kill then does not the cultivation of the
heart and head require, when after the
ordinary di&s;cipline of &s;chool and col|lege,
men of all ranks are found to be
infected with wrong bia&s;&s;es and irre|gular
a&s;&s;ociations, which &s;tand firm even
again&s;t the mo&s;t &s;olid rea&s;oning! Let
this con&s;ideration actuate tho&s;e who
pre&s;ide over the education of youth.
How deep are the impre&s;&s;ions, good or
bad, that are made in childhood! As
this is the proper period for impre&s;&s;ions,
what have not teachers to an&s;wer for
who neglect that period. With re&s;pect
to religion in particular, the mo&s;t impor|tant
branch of education, it is in the
power of a &s;en&s;ible tutor to in&s;til into
his pupil, notions &s;o ju&s;t and clear as to
&s;ecure him again&s;t every hurtful error.
Above all, let it be inculcated, that reli|gion
is the great &s;upport of morality,
that it is our &s;tronge&s;t &s;afeguard again&s;t
<PB N="309" REF="317">

<P>IN my journey through Fife I met with
nothing remarkable, &s;ave a good coun|try
in the &s;tate of nature. The bi&s;hop|ric
of Durham is reckoned one of the
fine&s;t di&s;tricts in England. Fife like it,
&s;preads every where into little green hills
and valleys; but no planting, no inclo|&s;ing,
poor crops of corn except upon the
coa&s;t, and very little gra&s;s. The &s;pirit of
improvement, is indeed beginning in that
country; and planting and inclo&s;ing will
give it a very fine appearance. Cupar,
the county town, is plea&s;antly &s;ituated on
the banks of the Eden. A bleaching-field
<PB N="350" REF="357">
is lately made there, which will promote
the linen manufacture in that country,
hitherto little advanced. In our road
from this town to Dundee, a curious
group of figures &s;truck us, that would be
a good &s;ubject for a picture. A little
woman was &s;hearing corn on a little
ridge. Behind her was a boy about eight
or nine, gleaning what fell from her hand.
At the &s;ide of the corn &s;tood a cradle with
an infant in it, rocked by a girl younger
than the boy. At &s;ome di&s;tance a little
cow was tethered, and by it a little dog
lying. I mi&s;&s;ed nothing of the family
but the little cat, which I &s;uppo&s;e was
left at home to guard the little hou&s;e.
How few are the nece&s;&s;ities of nature,
and how ea&s;ily provided for? May we
not imagine this little woman as content|ed,
as the great Lord of the manor?</P>
<P>DUNDEE is a trading town, advantage|ou&s;ly
&s;ituated on the river Tay, two miles
<PB N="351" REF="358">
above where it falls into the &s;ea. The
river is there two miles broad and makes
a fine appearance. The town has been
encrea&s;ing ever &s;ince the Union in the
number of inhabitants and goodne&s;s of
the hou&s;es. They are now at work about
a town-hou&s;e, the plan of which they
have from Mr Adams. Though Dundee
is the large&s;t town in Angus, yet Forfar
is the county town. It &s;tands in the great
valley of Strathmore, that runs from Perth
north-ea&s;t to the &s;ea almo&s;t in a &s;traight
line, about fifty miles long, and betwixt
four and five broad; bordered on either
&s;ide by hills ri&s;ing gently on the &s;outh
&s;ide, and on the north by the famous
Grampians a little more elevated. 'Tis a
beautiful &s;trath or valley adorned with
hou&s;es and planting, and inter&s;ected with
rivers de&s;cending from the hills. Forfar
is a royal burgh, poor indeed, having
little to brag of but its antiquity. King
Malcolm Canmore held his fir&s;t parlia|ment
<PB N="352" REF="359">
there, and the ruins of his palace
are yet to be &s;een. The town is &s;ituated
at the &s;ide of a lake, within which there is
an i&s;land where Queen Margaret retired
after her hu&s;band Malcolm Canmore's de|cea&s;e.
There is a tradition in the town
of Forfar, that to this queen, canonized
afterward for a &s;aint, we owe the cu&s;tom
of the grace drink: &s;he e&s;tabli&s;hed a rule,
that whoever &s;taid till grace was &s;aid,
was to be rewarded with a bumper. This
piece of hi&s;tory diverted us and occa&s;ion|ed
&s;ome reflections. In the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place, it
appears &s;urpri&s;ing that one &s;hould be e|ternized
for &s;uch a trifle. I know not but
this may have been the principal flouri&s;h
in the preamble of Queen Margaret's
patent for &s;aint&s;hip. But when we ex|amine
the nature and cour&s;e of things,
the &s;urpri&s;e vani&s;hes. Our nation was
then in its infancy, examples of $word$,
public &s;pirit, devotion, learning, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> rare.
Every thing makes a figure in a country
<PB N="353" REF="360">
not overlooked with examples of the &s;ame
kind. In the next age, it required the
building a church or mortifying an e&s;tate
to gain the character of &s;aint, purcha&s;ed
by our Margaret at &s;o much ea&s;ier a rate.
In the fir&s;t ages, men were e&s;teemed he|roes
for &s;ubduing a robber or for kill|ing
a wild boar. Hercules reigns to this
day for no higher exploits; and in this
country, it is reported that the origin of
Lord Sommerville's family is owing to
the de&s;troying an overgrown worm, the
figure of which animal, and of the chief|tain
in the act of killing, remain cut in
&s;tone in the old kirk of Linton. Turn
over the lives of the ancient Greek philo|&s;ophers,
and many of them will be found
eterni&s;ed for a &s;aying or opinion, for
which a man would not think one jot the
better of his pari&s;h mini&s;ter. Happy are
they who delight in fame, to live in &s;uch
ages! The &s;ame circum&s;tances of a
people may al&s;o explain how the grace
<PB N="354" REF="361">
cup, a thing that among us at pre&s;ent
would be but the maggot of a day, &s;hould
have grown into a general cu&s;tom. Scot|land
being then in its infancy, de&s;titute
of laws, de&s;titute of cu&s;toms, rude even
in the art of &s;peech, manners and cu&s;toms
would be ea&s;ily introduced to fill a va|cuity;
and when a cu&s;tom is once intro|duced,
even upon the &s;lighte&s;t foundati|on,
it continues long in vigour, becau&s;e
there is nothing to put it out of its place.
A nation advanced to maturity is in a
different condition. Every thing there
being reduced to form and figure, there
is little room left for new cu&s;toms or
new manners. Here however a di&s;tinc|tion
occurs between cu&s;toms that gain
&s;trength by habit, and tho&s;e that are na|turally
fluctuating &s;uch as the fa&s;hions of
dre&s;s. But at pre&s;ent being not much
inclined to deep &s;peculation, I yield to
nature in her pur&s;uit of more airy game.
And here I ob&s;erve, that whatever may
<PB N="355" REF="362">
be thought of the world turning wor&s;e
and wor&s;e, the men in tho&s;e ancient times
have not been more religious than they
are now. Were people bribed to go to
church by a good dinner after &s;ermon,
we &s;hould find churches as much crowd|ed
as ever. In former ages too, it &s;eems
we were &s;atisfied with the form of religi|on
as well as at pre&s;ent. But what comes
of the ladies all this while; for &s;ure
Queen Margaret was too polite to think
of a bumper as a reward to them. What|ever
might be done in private, they would
not be inclined to exert their prowe&s;s in
public. In drinking-bouts and love-in|trigues,
they &s;trictly follow the &s;cripture,
not to let their left know what their right
is doing. A lady to whom I was talk|ing
of this defect in Queen Margaret's
plan, gave me a ready an&s;wer. Fix the
men, &s;ays &s;he, and no fear of the ladies.
This &s;olution mu&s;t be acknowledged in|genious
as well as ingenuous: whether
<PB N="356" REF="363">
&s;olid or not the ladies can be&s;t tell. For
my part, I would incline to put it upon
a better footing: the women in all ages
have been remarkable for their piety;
and therefore I &s;uppo&s;e that this law was
made for the men only: the ladies will
ob&s;erve decency at lea&s;t, without a bribe.</P>
<P>WERE I to de&s;cribe Forfar in the he|roic

<P>THE fine&s;t thing &s;een here, is an edi|fice

<PB N="357" REF="364">
to be as &s;weet a dwelling as one would
wi&s;h for. It has been expo&s;ed to &s;ale for
years; and yet, which is &s;trange, no pur|cha&s;er
has been found. 'Tis true, it is
not richly furni&s;hed, and riches go a
great way in tho&s;e days. For my part,
I willingly would have taken a lea&s;e of
it, but had not money for the purcha&s;e.

<P>FROM Forfar our company came by
invitation to Gallery, the &s;eat of Mr Ful|lerton,
a gentleman who made his for|tune
in the We&s;t Indies, and now for
&s;ome years has been &s;ettled in his native
land, where he pa&s;&s;es his time with ea&s;e
and chearfulne&s;s, free from the hurry of
bu&s;ine&s;s and fracas of great towns, which
he &s;ays he is heartily tired of. He is in|deed
an agreeable old man, has a very
good hou&s;e with fine gardens &s;ituated
<PB N="358" REF="365">
upon the river of Montro&s;e in Strath|more.
He diverted us with an incident
that happened lately. He has relations
in the county of Cornwall. One of them,
a young E&s;quire, made him a vi&s;it this
&s;ummer, of three or four weeks. The
tender mamma, who had di&s;mal notions
of Scotland, begged her child for God's
&s;ake to return home before the weather
&s;hould break, which might be dangerous
in &s;o wild a country. Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with
this opinion, the young gentleman with
his governor arrived at Gallery. Could
they fail to be &s;urpri&s;ed with the finene&s;s
of the gardens, variety of the fruits, and
gaiety of the fields? Above all, &s;ome o|range
and almond-trees &s;truck the &s;age
governor with admiration. An orange-tree
in a pot had by &s;ome accident been
left in the kitchen-garden: the gra&s;s had
grown up that nothing was &s;een but the
plant. The curious governor, whom you
may &s;uppo&s;e a member of the Royal So|ciety,
<PB N="359" REF="366">
e&s;pied this wonder fir&s;t, and called
upon his pupil to behold. Mr Fullerton,
with a well acted indifference, &s;eemed to
know nothing of the matter, only that
to be &s;ure it had been &s;ome &s;eed of the
orange-tree, blown there by the wind,
or accidentally dropt by the gardener.
The man was ravi&s;hed at the di&s;covery&mdash;the
pocket-book was pulled out, day and
place marked with all circum&s;tances.
This po&s;&s;ibly may be heard of in the
tran&s;actions of the Royal Society. Thus
travellers fir&s;t impo&s;e upon them&s;elves,
and then upon the world.</P>
<P>ABERDEEN at pre&s;ent is one of the
mo&s;t flouri&s;hing towns in the kingdom.
They tell me, that &s;ince the memory of
man the inhabitants are doubled. Their
own manufactures are exported annually
to the value of near a hundred thou&s;and
pounds Sterling, which is mo&s;tly return|ed
in &s;pecie. The inhabitants of the
<PB N="360" REF="367">
&s;hire are an indu&s;trious people, man, wife
and child employed. Abundance of good
company in the town it&s;elf, a more ho|&s;pitable
people are no where to be met
with.</P>
<P>EPISCOPACY and the liturgy of the
Church of England prevails much more
here than in the &s;outhern parts, and in
proportion gentlemen who are no friends
to the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment. However
of late many of them have got over the
&s;cruple of taking oaths, in order to &s;erve
their friends at elections: for we mu&s;t
not believe that there is any change in
their political principles. To one un|acquainted
with the world and its man|ners,
this mu&s;t appear extremely &s;hocking.
To call God to witne&s;s a lie; to promi&s;e,
bind my&s;elf, in the mo&s;t po&s;itive terms,
when I never intend to perform; what,
it will be &s;aid, can be more wicked?
And yet when I look abroad into the
<PB N="361" REF="368">
world and find &s;o many gentlemen of
honour acting this part with &s;carce any
remor&s;e, I am puzzled and cannot help
&s;topping &s;hort to con&s;ider, whether after
all this practice be &s;o criminal. If it be,
it is &s;urely the &s;ingle in&s;tance in nature
of a great crime attended with &s;carce any
remor&s;e or indignation. But this cannot
be. All crimes mu&s;t give us abhorrence;
and be we ever &s;o well read in Grotius and
Puffendorf, there is no rule given us to
judge of human actions &s;o certain as what
we draw from our own heart. The me|rit
or demerit of actions is in proportion
to the good or hurt they do. Lying,
&s;wearing fal&s;ely, breach of promi&s;e, are
criminal as tending to the di&s;&s;olution of
&s;ociety, which cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without
mutual faith and tru&s;t among men. This
is what makes treachery &s;o odious a
crime. On the other hand, whatever
words a man u&s;es, yet if it be clearly un|der&s;tood,
that no faith is intended to be
<PB N="362" REF="369">
given or received, they are of no moment.
Thus it is with the common civilities and
compliments pa&s;&s;ing among men, which
one would be reckoned a fool to depend
on. Thus, to go a little deeper, cu&s;tom-hou&s;e
oaths now a-days go for nothing.
Not that the world grows more wicked,
but becau&s;e no per&s;on lays any &s;tre&s;s up|on
them. The duty on French wine is
the &s;ame in Scotland and in England.
But as we cannot afford to pay this high
duty, the permi&s;&s;ion underhand to pay
Spani&s;h duty for French wine, is found
more beneficial to the revenue, than the
rigour of the law. The oath however
mu&s;t be taken that the wine we import
is Spani&s;h, to entitle us to the ea&s;e of the
Spani&s;h duty. Such oaths at fir&s;t were
highly criminal, becau&s;e directly a fraud
again&s;t the public; but now that the
oath is only exacted for form's &s;ake,
without any faith intended to be given
or received, it becomes very little different
<PB N="363" REF="370">
from &s;aying in the way of civility &startq;I
am, Sir, your friend, or your obedient
&s;ervant.&endq; And in fact, we every day
&s;ee merchants dealing in &s;uch oaths whom
no man &s;cruples to rely upon in the mo&s;t
material affairs. I could wi&s;h, that the ta|king
oaths to the government, when the
heart goes not along, were but as innocent.
So far is plain, that when a man takes
oaths in order to get into power, is tru&s;t|ed,
and betrays his tru&s;t, nothing can be
more vitious. But let us &s;uppo&s;e he takes
the oaths to pre&s;erve his e&s;tate, to give
bread to his family, or to &s;erve his friend
at an election who is friendly to the go|vernment;
how far is this criminal?
We mu&s;t examine fir&s;t, how far it was
right in the Parliament to impo&s;e &s;uch
oaths. This matter ought to be handled
tenderly; yet there is no avoiding enter|ing
into it. Here the di&s;tinction natural|ly
ca&s;ts up betwixt a manife&s;t rebellion,
and a civil war occa&s;ioned by a contro|verted
<PB N="364" REF="371">
title. Of the la&s;t &s;ort, none will
que&s;tion the Revolution to have been;
and the&s;e gentlemen who did, and do
&s;tand out again&s;t the Revolution, mu&s;t be
allowed to be acting again&s;t private in|tere&s;t
upon a principle of con&s;cience.
One would think it hard to treat &s;uch
gentlemen as common robbers or rebels.
All laws, human and divine, teach us to
treat them with lenity. And indeed in
the main, they are &s;o treated. Yet of
&s;ome &s;everities, they have rea&s;on to com|plain.
For example, if they be allowed
the protection of the government, for
what good rea&s;on &s;hould they not be per|mitted
to gain a livelihood in any private
way they are capable of? Why may not
a man be an advocate, though it does
not go clearly with his mind, that the
Chevalier is a ba&s;tard? This &s;urely is a
hard&s;hip; and the people I am talking
of, will be apt to hold the oath of abjura|tion,
to be rigorous and unju&s;t. If they
<PB N="365" REF="372">
bow the head in the hou&s;e of Rimmon,
they have the A&s;&s;yrian for their example,
and the prophet for their authority. To
be peaceable &s;ubjects without attempting
to di&s;turb the Government, they think
is all that can rea&s;onably be exacted of
them. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, there is le&s;s
to be &s;aid in ju&s;tification of tho&s;e who
&s;wallow the oaths, for no better rea&s;on
than to a&s;&s;i&s;t their friend at an election.
Yet even here, it may be thought, that
&s;uch oath, cannot be very criminal where
no harm is done or intended, it being
the &s;ame to the Government whether the
one or the other candidate, both of them
friends, be returned. This is a theme I
thought well worthy of con&s;ideration. It
le&s;&s;ens our horror to find that our coun|trymen
are not &s;o criminal as we at fir&s;t
imagine. If there be any weight in this
apology, it ought to teach all govern|ments
to be tender in impo&s;ing oaths: if
rigorous or unrea&s;onable, they will &s;carce
<PB N="366" REF="373">
an&s;wer the end; and their multiplicity
tends to break faith and confidence a|mong
men. Balancing however ill with
good, it may be a que&s;tion, whether we
have been great &s;ufferers by the political
oaths impo&s;ed &s;ince the Revolution. On
the one hand, there is the evil tendency
we have been &s;peaking of: on the other,
the&s;e oaths have been u&s;eful in making
men better &s;ubjects. No hone&s;t man, by
whatever motive prevailed on to take the
oaths, but mu&s;t con&s;ider them as &s;ome
pledge of his obedience; and it is fact,
that many a one has thus been carried
imperceptibly from his old friends, and
become at la&s;t a hearty friend to the pre|&s;ent
e&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>THE following adventure happened
lately in Aberdeen&s;hire. Though the
little god of Love has become a dome&s;tic
animal, yet his wings are not &s;o much
&s;hortened, but that goo&s;e-like, he can now
<PB N="367" REF="374">
and then make a &s;hort flight. Gordo|nio,
the ordinary fate of younger bro|thers,
was left to &s;hift for him&s;elf with a
very &s;mall patrimony. By great penury
and much indu&s;try, he has &s;craped toge|ther
about ten thou&s;and pounds. When
about fifty he fell in love; the fir&s;t time
that any pa&s;&s;ion had touched his brea&s;t,
&s;ave that of gain. Where had it lurked
all this while? The young lady was a|ver&s;e,
the man at once became a new
creature. The change was fir&s;t ob&s;erved
in his dre&s;s and air. The rolled &s;tockings
di&s;appeared, his breeches had buckles
at the knees; and what was a new &s;ight
in Aberdeen, were held up by a large
buckle behind. Fine linen, powdered
wigs, followed of cour&s;e: the man now
is erect with an open countenance. In
a word, he would not be known to be
the &s;loven that walked about in a pace
&s;low and circum&s;pect, his eyes upon the
ground, fear and care imprinted on his
<PB N="368" REF="375">
vi&s;age. The fort at la&s;t &s;urrendered, and
it is computed the &s;iege co&s;t him above
five hundred pounds. What cannot gold
perform? He has been married above a
twelvemonth, and is now the mo&s;t ho&s;|pitable
man in Aberdeen. Every body
approves of his ta&s;te, his wife being a
chearful and agreeable woman. He is
&s;paring of nothing but of his words, and
to &s;uch a degree, that he &s;till retains an
old bye-word, &startq;All in good time;&endq;
which indeed he has right to appropri|ate,
the phra&s;e being expre&s;&s;ive of his
own fortune. I do not remember a &s;to|ry
that comes nearer to that of Cymon
and Iphigenia; only this is within the
bounds of nature. Cymon is repre&s;ent|ed
a &s;tupid fool; and yet to fall in love
at fir&s;t &s;ight, requires no &s;light degree of
&s;en&s;ibility. But to let that pa&s;s, our Cy|mon
is a &s;trong in&s;tance how uncertain
our gue&s;&s;es are about the characters of
men. Fifty years of his life had pa&s;&s;ed,
<PB N="369" REF="376">
when, by accident, he became acquaint|ed
with the la&s;s that made the fir&s;t im|pre&s;&s;ion
on his heart. Had not this hap|pened,
he would have jogged on in the
old way, and no mortal have known, nay
not he him&s;elf, what &s;ort of a man he is.
Had Oliver Cromwell been much addicted
to mu&s;ic, agriculture, or any trifling a|mu&s;ement,
it might have kept him at
home without thinking of overturning
the con&s;titution. Upon &s;uch &s;lender
hinges do the greate&s;t events turn.</P>
<P>THE county of Murray, is one of the
fine&s;t in the kingdom; in its &s;ituation
and climate, very much re&s;embling Ea&s;t
Lothian. Elgin the county-town is beau|tifully
&s;eated in a plain upon the river
Lo&s;&s;y, which runs into the &s;ea about
four miles below. Its cour&s;e lies betwixt
two lakes; that of Spenzie on the we&s;t,
which covers a great quantity of land;
that of Coats on the ea&s;t, of a much le&s;s
<PB N="370" REF="377">
&s;ize. The old ca&s;tle of Duffus, the &s;eat
of the family, is &s;ituated in a plain, clo&s;e
to the lake of Spenzie, formerly a mile
from it. This change was wrought by
&s;everal late inundations of the river Lo&s;|&s;y,
which filling the lake with &s;and, rai&s;|ed
the water and made it over&s;pread much
ground. I believe it might be po&s;&s;ible
to drain this lake altogether; but belong|ing
to many proprietors, it is not ea&s;y to
make them join in a common mea&s;ure.
One thing they would lo&s;e. A great
quantity of &s;wans come down from the
hills and re&s;ort there in winter. Mur|ray
is a &s;andy &s;oil, e&s;pecially toward the
&s;ea. There is a great tract of land ea&s;t
of the river Findhorn, which in the year
1690, was overblown with &s;and, and to
this day, has a di&s;mal appearance, occa|&s;ioned
by a pernicious cu&s;tom of pulling
bent upon the &s;and-hills at the &s;hore,
now prohibited by Act of Parliament.
In the road from Innes to Gordon&s;ton on
<PB N="371" REF="378">
the ea&s;t &s;ide of the river Lo&s;&s;y, for a mile
together, you meet with bare gravel like
what is at the mouth of great rivers: but
every now and then, there are pillars of
&s;and about &s;even feet high, with gra&s;s a
top. This formerly was all a &s;andy &s;oil
about &s;even feet deep above the gravel.
The country people by paring the &s;urface
for covering their hou&s;es, laid the &s;and
open to the wind, which in a few years
over&s;pread a great &s;pace of land. But
luckily the wind blowing &s;trongly from
the &s;outh-we&s;t before the &s;and was cover|ed
with gra&s;s, the whole was driven into
the &s;ea; and now one will &s;carce di&s;cern
where it has been. Sir Robert Gordon's
e&s;tate lies a few miles we&s;t from the river
Lo&s;&s;y upon the &s;ea. Such another acci|dent
&s;ome years ago over&s;pread a part of
this e&s;tate with &s;and, particularly a piece
of link ground. The &s;and rotted the &s;ur|face
of the links, and the &s;outh wind not
only blew the new &s;and into the &s;ea, but
<PB N="372" REF="379">
with it the &s;and that had formed the
links; and to the &s;urpri&s;e of every body,
the ground below was fine &s;oil, and had
actually carried corn, for it was lying in
ridges.</P>
<P>The mo&s;&s;es in this county and in Aber|deen&s;hire,
furni&s;h the only feuel they
have at home; for there is no coal but
what is brought by &s;ea, nor is there any
wood in the county, at lea&s;t in the low
parts of it. The&s;e mo&s;&s;es are formed by
the rotting of wood; and there is &s;carce
a mo&s;s that has not much wood, not quite
di&s;&s;olved. Nothing is more evident: and
yet it puzzles me; for by this account
the whole &s;urface of the earth mu&s;t have
been mo&s;s. Berwick&s;hire lies low, and
many parts of it wet. It was once all
wood, which &s;urely was not all cut down
for u&s;e. How comes it then, that there
is not the lea&s;t ve&s;tige of mo&s;s in the low|er
<PB N="373" REF="380">
part of a county where it was mo&s;t na|tural
to expect it?</P>
<P>THE hou&s;e of Innes is one of the mo&s;t
commodious old hou&s;es in this country.
The ground &s;torey is vaulted. The prin|cipal
apartment above the vaults, con&s;i&s;ts
of two grand rooms, one of them forty-eight
feet long; the two &s;toreys above
contain ten well proportioned bed-cham|bers,
and the hou&s;e is provided with a
hand&s;ome &s;cale &s;tair-ca&s;e. Over the great
door there is the following in&s;cription,
<HI>Nulli certa domus,</HI> No man's habitation is
certain. Does this in&s;cription &s;how a
&s;pirit of re&s;ignation; or can vanity be
di&s;cerned lurking under the ma&s;k of hu|mility?
Compare this with the in&s;crip|tion
on the &s;tandard of the great Saladin.
THIS BLACK SHIRT IS ALL THAT SALA|DIN
CONQUEROR OF THE EAST SHALL
CARRY TO HIS GRAVE. Sure there was
no vanity here, but an angelic moderati|on
<PB N="374" REF="381">
on pre&s;erved amid illu&s;trious victories. It
was a great atchievement of a private gen|tleman
to build the hou&s;e of Innes, near
two hundred years ago; and what he
had rea&s;on to value him&s;elf upon. To
&s;ee &s;uch an in&s;cription over the little
door of a cottage, would indeed be ludi|crous;
no le&s;s &s;o than what is reported of
a little man elected Provo&s;t of Aberdeen,
who, amid the congratulations of his ac|quaintance,
laid his hand upon his brea&s;t,
and declared that after all he was but a
mortal man. Po&s;&s;ibly one of an exalted
&s;oul would cla&s;s the builder of Innes with
the Provo&s;t of Aberdeen. For my part, I
&s;hould value my&s;elf much upon &s;o hand|&s;ome
a performance; and am therefore of
opinion, the in&s;cription is le&s;s allied to
vanity than to re&s;ignation. In matters of
opinion, there is no fixed &s;tandard to judge
by. Our opinions are various like our
temper, becau&s;e it has great influence on
them.</P>

INVERNESS, 10th October. In this
country a new &s;cene opens which tho&s;e of
the &s;outh know little of. The people here
are generally divided into tribes or clans,
who acknowledge a chief, whom they
more willingly obey than their king. No
&s;afety for a man who would live inde|pendent:
he is obliged to inli&s;t him&s;elf
into one or other clan. A gentleman, in
order to affront a neighbour, &s;tole away
the dead body of a near relation, whom
the neighbour was preparing to bury.
The friends were convened for the burial;
but behold the corp&s;e was gone. This oc|ca&s;ioned
a Ju&s;ticiary trial. The only wit|ne&s;&s;es
were the criminal's accomplices, all
of them of his own name. They depo|&s;ed
point blank that none of them had &s;o
much as heard of the thing, till &s;pread all
over the country. No body doubted of
the perjury. I was &s;tunned, and could
not help ob&s;erving to one of the judges,
<PB N="376" REF="383">
that the &s;ouls of the&s;e people were as
much at their chieftain's devotion, as their
bodies. In a conver&s;ation about clan&s;hip,
a gentleman of the name of Grant, a
Lieutenant in an independent company,
blundered out his true &s;entiments, that
he would rather hear of the Grants &s;teal|ing
three cows, than hearing of one &s;tolen
from them. This is &s;avage, but not &s;o
much as may be imagined. The clans
hate one another, but are remarkably ho|ne&s;t
to tho&s;e of their own name. And
their mutual depredations are rather to
be con&s;idered as repri&s;als than as theft.
The ca&s;e here is preci&s;ely the &s;ame as be|tween
Scotland and England, before and
for &s;ome time after the Union of the two
Crowns. To enliven the conver&s;ation, I
took the part of my blunt friend, and
flouri&s;hed the be&s;t I could upon this to|pic.
The Captain was ravi&s;hed. I &s;aid
further, that the old Romans were all di|vided
<PB N="377" REF="384">
into clans. When I found I was
li&s;tened to, my vanity led me to di&s;play a
little of my learning. I ob&s;erved that in
the Roman &s;tate, their tribes had like our
clans a common name; that when a tribe
grew numerous, it was divided into what
the Romans called <HI>families;</HI> and in &s;ome
of the mo&s;t populous tribes, the families
were again divided into <HI>&s;tripes</HI> or branches.
In &s;uch ca&s;es every man had four names:
the fir&s;t was his proper name, &s;uch as <HI>Caius</HI>
or <HI>Lucius,</HI> or Peter or John among us. The
&s;econd was the name of the tribe, the
third, of the family, the fourth, of the
branch. I added, that clan&s;hip is a great
bulwark again&s;t ab&s;olute monarchy and
tyrannical government, it being ea&s;ier to
&s;ubdue one man than ten thou&s;and firmly
united by all the ties of blood and friend|&s;hip.
For that rea&s;on, the Roman Em|perors
never were at re&s;t, till they broke
and di&s;&s;olved all the clan-connections.
They began with opening the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
<PB N="378" REF="385">
of land to females; and proceeded &s;tep
by &s;tep, till there remained no traces of
clan&s;hip more than now in England or
in the &s;outhern counties of Scotland.</P>
<P>REFLECTING afterwards on this con|ver&s;ation,
&s;everal things occurred to me.
Succe&s;&s;ion with us has an air of accident
more than of de&s;ign. We admit female-&s;ucce&s;&s;ion;
and yet none of my mother's
relations can &s;ucceed to me. If we fol|low
nature, why &s;hould brothers or &s;i|&s;ters
be excluded though related only by
the mother? If our views be political,
why not exclude women altogether and
keep e&s;tates within the name?</P>
<P>IN this country we &s;ee no good ef|fects
of clan&s;hip; con&s;tant quarrels and
&s;omewhat like natural antipathy between
clans; and of cour&s;e entire neglect of
the public. We find nothing &s;imilar in the
Roman &s;tory, if the &s;truggles be except|ed
<PB N="379" REF="386">
betwixt the Patricians and Plebeians,
which, on the part of the latter, were for
liberty not &s;uperiority. How to be ac|counted
for that the private tribe-combi|nation
did not in the lea&s;t impair their pa|trioti&s;m?
As the mind of man is of a li|mited
capacity, the more regard we have
for one &s;et of men, the le&s;s is left to be|&s;tow
upon others; con&s;equently the af|fection
a Roman had to be&s;tow upon one
of another tribe could not be great: every
one knows how little regard the Patrici|ans
and Plebeians had for one another.
As clan&s;hip therefore mu&s;t be unfavour|able
to patrioti&s;m, we cannot &s;ufficiently
admire the Roman method of education,
which &s;upported that noble affection a|gain&s;t
the undermining influence of the
clan-connection. But now what &s;hall
we &s;ay of our family feuds, of which
&s;carce a foot&s;tep among the Romans.
This &s;eems a puzzling que&s;tion. The
Roman clan&s;hip was an union or &s;ociety
<PB N="380" REF="387">
among equals: our clan&s;hip, a petty go|vernment
of &s;ubjects united under one
head or chieftain. Here light breaks in.
A &s;ociety among equals tends to defence
more than offence: a &s;ociety of &s;ubjects
under a common chief, tends to offence
as much as to defence.</P>
<P>WAS the Roman clan&s;hip a proper con|&s;titution
in a great &s;tate? On the one hand,
where one is born a &s;ubject of a &s;tate &s;o
exten&s;ive as &s;carce to make any connec|tion
among individuals, he has nothing
but merit and engaging manners to de|pend
on. The acting a part in the middle
of an unconcerned multitude, is next to
acting in a &s;olitude. On the other hand,
every individual of a clan has the &s;up|port
of the whole; and is be&s;ides em|boldened,
by acting in the &s;ight of many
who are concerned in him as friends and
relations, who he knows will take his
part right or wrong. This re&s;olves all
<PB N="381" REF="388">
into birth, with little or no regard to
per&s;onal merit, which is attended with
every inconvenience that is remarkable
in hereditary nobility.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> The reader will judge, whether
this young gentleman had not only
made good u&s;e of his time, but had al&s;o
been in the practice of a common-place-book,
long before this fir&s;t excur&s;ion.</P>
