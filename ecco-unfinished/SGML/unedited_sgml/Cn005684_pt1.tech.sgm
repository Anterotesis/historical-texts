Her Novels and Tales, that
were publi&s;hed &s;ome Years ago,
are well worthy E&s;teem; but
the&s;e &s;eem far more correct, and
the Tales &s;o happily interwoven

<P>I &s;hall not pretend to &s;ay any

<P>_WHEN the Rigours of a long and &s;e|vere

their particular Reflection on her Lazine&s;s; but
their Impatience to &s;ee the many beautiful Objects
that there pre&s;ented them&s;elves, over-balancing the
De&s;ire they might otherwi&s;e have had to &s;tay with
her, Mr. <HI>de St.</HI>&mdash;told her, &startq;That as the Con|ver&s;ation
&s;he expected from the Inhabitants of that
Wood were &s;omewhat uncertain; he would lend
her &s;ome Fairy Stories that would divert her very
agreeably.&endq; &startq;They mu&s;t be none of my own

a Nymph by me, who&s;e bright Eyes, lively
Air, and genteel Behaviour gave me as much Sati&s;|faction,
as they caus'd Surprize in me: A loo&s;e
Garment that &s;he wore di&s;cover'd the ju&s;t Pro|portion
of her Shape; the Plaitings of her Hair
were tied down to her Wa&s;te by a bunch of Rib|bons,
and the Exactne&s;s of her Features was alto|gether
plea&s;ing; and I was going to &s;peak to her,

a Corre&s;pondence, &s;ometimes with the Mu&s;es, and
&s;ometimes with Fairies, you cannot be weary of

&startq;They are Gifts, <HI>reply'd Madam</HI> d'Anois, wherewith
we generally want a great many other nece&s;&s;ary
Things; hitherto, my good Friends the Fairies
have not been very prodigal of their Favours to
me, therefore I can a&s;&s;ure you, that I re&s;olve to
have as little Value for them as they have for me.&endq;

<HEAD>The Story of Don GABRIEL.</HEAD>
<P>_DON <HI>Felix Sarmiento</HI> was a Gentleman, both
of Quality and Merit, in the Province of
<HI>Gallicia,</HI> where he married Donna <HI>Henrica
de Palacios,</HI> of a Family no way inferiour
to his. By this Marriage he had a very hand&s;ome
and accompli&s;h'd Gentleman for his Son, call'd,
Don <HI>Lewis;</HI> and two Daughters, who for Wit and
Beauty were not to be equall'd in all that Province.</P>
<P>Their Mother, who was a Lady di&s;tingui&s;h'd for
her Virtue and Worth, being &s;urpriz'd with a &s;ud|den
and violent Di&s;ea&s;e at one of her Country-Seats,
had only time to &s;end for her Si&s;ter-in-Law,
to leave her Daughters to her Care. &startq;Dear Si&s;ter,
<HI>&s;aid &s;he, when &s;he was come,</HI> &s;ince there cannot
be any Depo&s;it more dear to me than this I en|tru&s;t
you with, promi&s;e me that my Daughters
&s;hall find in you what they are going to lo&s;e in
me: Love <HI>I&s;idora</HI> and <HI>Melanthia,</HI> both for my &s;ake
and their own, and cultivate their Di&s;po&s;itions,
which are excellent. I promis'd my &s;elf to neg|lect
nothing in their Education, but alas! we
mu&s;t be &s;eparated.&endq; Here &s;he was interrupted by
tho&s;e two lovely Creatures, each on her Knees
by the Bed-&s;ide, holding her Mother's Hand, ki&s;|&s;ing
and bathing it with Tears, with &s;o much Love
and Re&s;pect, as &s;hew'd they were not to be parted.
&startq;What, my dear Children, <HI>&s;aid &s;he to them,</HI> do you
<PB N="4" REF="13">
endeavour to &s;tay me? It &s;eems as if you would
make me regret a Life I am going to &s;urrender
to the Will of the Divine Providence: in&s;tead of
di&s;piriting me, rather encourage me.&endq; &startq;Si&s;ter,
<HI>continu'd &s;he, addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to Donna</HI> Juana, I beg
of you not to bring them too &s;oon on the Stage
of this World, which abounds in &s;uch dangerous
Charms and Temptations, &s;o much to be dreaded,
that they &s;tand in need of a great &s;hare of Sen&s;e
and Prudence, both to know and re&s;i&s;t them.&endq;</P>
<P>Donna <HI>Juana,</HI> who was an old Maid, and more
&s;evere than all the Duegna's of <HI>Spain</HI> put together,
was overjoy'd at the&s;e la&s;t Words of her Si&s;ter-in-Law,
and without returning any An&s;wer to the
tender Expre&s;&s;ions &s;he had u&s;ed, cry'd out, &startq;I a&s;|&s;ure
you, your Daughters &s;hall not have the li|berty
to &s;ee the Sun; I will keep them &s;o clo&s;e
up, that the World &s;hall not know there are any
&s;uch Per&s;ons living: and &s;ince you have given
me the Charge of them, I will be a thou&s;and times
more rigorous than you your&s;elf would have
been.&endq; The Weakne&s;s of the &s;ick Lady hinder'd
her from an&s;wering, and moderating the&s;e &s;o hard
Re&s;olves; and for the young Ladies, they were too
much griev'd to hear what their Aunt &s;aid. After
having perform'd their la&s;t Devoirs, Donna <HI>Juana</HI>
carry'd them to another Country-Seat of their Fa|ther's,
near <HI>Compo&s;tella,</HI> who had at that time a
Command in <HI>Flanders,</HI> where he heard of his Wife's
Death, and her Di&s;po&s;al of his two Daughters. He
appear'd as much afflicted for the one, as di&s;&s;ati&s;|fy'd
with the other: for he knew his Si&s;ter's Cha|racter,
that &s;he was of a violent, in&s;lexible, and
mi&s;tru&s;tful Temper, and fore&s;aw that his Daughters
would find a great difference between the Govern|ment
of their Mother and that of their Aunt. But
con&s;idering that he was at a di&s;tance, and his
Daughters were very young and hand&s;ome, and
that it was better than putting them into a Con|vent;
he at la&s;t determin'd to let them be with
their Aunt Donna <HI>Juana.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="14">
When their Brother, who was then at <HI>Cadiz,</HI>
heard of his Mother's Death, he took Po&s;t to go
to condole with his Si&s;ters; and being a pretty
Gentleman, as I &s;aid before, his Pre&s;ence conduc'd
very much to the mitigating their Grief. When|ever
they could have any private Di&s;cour&s;e, for he
was in a &s;trict Union with them, they complain'd
to him, that Donna <HI>Juana</HI> was ill-natur'd, and
never to be pleas'd, that they never went abroad;
nor were permitted to &s;ee any Company; that &s;he
was always grumbling at them, and that they had
cau&s;e to be &s;en&s;ible of their Lo&s;s. &startq;Indeed, <HI>&s;aid
Don</HI> Lewis, Donna <HI>Juana</HI> is a Woman of Merit and
Virtue; but that Virtue is very un&s;ociable: for
as &s;he is neither hand&s;ome nor young, and never
was capable of in&s;piring any Tenderne&s;s, &s;he can|not
allow any little innocent Liberty before her.
I am afraid that at la&s;t &s;he will be jealous of the
Day that Lights you, &s;ince &s;he has already told
me &s;he'll let you &s;tir out but very &s;eldom, and
that when &s;he cannot di&s;pen&s;e with it; which will
be with &s;uch Precautions, that it will be im|po&s;&s;ible
to &s;ee you.&endq; &startq;I can a&s;&s;ure you, Brother,
<HI>&s;aid</HI> I&s;idora, &s;he may follow her own Caprice, as
to that Point, without my oppo&s;ing her; &s;ince
nothing hitherto has induc'd me to de&s;ire any
Commerce with the World which &s;he is &s;o very
much afraid of, provided &s;he u&s;es me kindly.&endq;
&startq;I &s;hall be well &s;atisfy'd, for my part, <HI>added</HI> Me|lanthia;
I have not yet &s;een any thing amiable
enough to make me regret my being thus de|barr'd
the &s;ight of Company.&endq; Don <HI>Lewis</HI> comfort|ed
them the be&s;t he could, and brought them
Books to divert them; and after a Month's abode
with them, return'd to <HI>Cadiz,</HI> whither his Bu&s;ine&s;s
and Plea&s;ures call'd him.</P>
<P>He had &s;everal Friends there, who were &s;en&s;ible
of his Ab&s;ence and de&s;irous of his Return; among
whom, Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> and the Count <HI>d' Aguilar</HI> were
the chief: they &s;ent every day to his Lodgings,
<PB N="6" REF="15">
and as &s;oon as he arriv'd, went to &s;ee him. Their
fir&s;t Conver&s;ation was &s;omewhat melancholy, be|cau&s;e
Don <HI>Lewis</HI> related his Mother's Death; but
&s;peaking afterwards of his Si&s;ters, he told them how
&s;everely his Aunt kept them, that they began to be
weary, and twas pity two &s;uch pretty Creatures
&s;hould be &s;o ill us'd: in &s;hort, he inlarged on
their Merit more like a Lover than a Brother.
Don <HI>G$briel</HI> &s;eem'd to take little notice of Don
<HI>Lewis</HI>'s Di&s;cour&s;e, but &s;peaking &s;uddenly of &s;ome|thing
el&s;e, &s;aid, &startq;I am &s;urpriz'd you have ask'd
no News of the beautiful <HI>Lucilla.</HI>&endq; &startq;You cannot
believe, <HI>reply'd Don</HI> Lewis, that it proceeds
from any Indifference; my Sentiments are too
lively and too well grounded to change: but I
thought I ought to begin our Conver&s;ation by
informing you of the State of our Family.&endq; &startq;<HI>Lu|cilla</HI>
lo&s;t her Brother by a very di&s;mal Accident,
and is gone to <HI>Sevil</HI> to admini&s;ter to his E&s;tate,
<HI>&s;aid the Count</HI> d'Aguilar, from whence I believe
&s;he will not return very &s;peedily.&endq; &startq;Since &s;he is
not here, <HI>continu'd Don</HI> Lewis, I &s;hall not &s;tay long
with you, I mu&s;t go to-morrow.&endq; &startq;What a vio|lent
ha&s;te you are in? <HI>an&s;wer'd Don</HI> Gabriel: do you
think there is nothing due from you to us? But
tho the Tie may not be &s;o great, yet 'tis inju&s;tice
in you to be&s;tow all on one.&endq; &startq;Your Rights in my
Heart are not to be di&s;puted, <HI>reply'd Don</HI> Lewis
<HI>&s;miling,</HI> but you know a Mi&s;tre&s;s and a Friend
are two different Things, &s;ince the Sentiments
we have for each interfere not with one another.&endq;
&startq;Oh! <HI>&s;aid Count</HI> d'Aguilar <HI>laughing,</HI> you love us very
well, but you are going to leave us to-morrow
for <HI>Lucilla;</HI> indeed, the Rights we have in your
Heart are too much limited, and hers too much
enlarg'd: but cannot you, without offending that
fair Lady, &s;tay here till &s;he returns?&endq; &startq;No, Sir,
I cannot, <HI>an&s;wer'd Don</HI> Lewis, without giving her
&s;ome Chagrin, and that I would not do for all
the World: Friend&s;hip is more rea&s;onable than
<PB N="7" REF="16">
Love, and gives greater Liberties; I can leave
you without gaining your Di&s;plea&s;ure, and I am
&s;ure I &s;hall always find you the &s;ame when I re|turn.&endq;
&startq;Oh! how happy am I, <HI>cry'd Don</HI> Gabriel,
to enjoy my Liberty, to be, in re&s;pect of the Fair
Sex, like a Butterfly in a Meadow of fine Flow|ers,
able to fly over them, and never fix on one.&endq;
Don <HI>Lewis</HI> &s;igh'd at the&s;e words, either becau&s;e he
was not &s;o much at ea&s;e as his Friend, or becau&s;e
he was not at the feet of the Di&s;turber of his Re|po&s;e.</P>
<P>They parted with a thou&s;and Prote&s;tations of
Friend&s;hip; Don <HI>Lewis</HI> went to <HI>Sevil,</HI> as he had
determined, and Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> and the Count <HI>d'Agui|lar,</HI>
who lodged together, and were intimate Friends,
&s;taid at <HI>Cadiz;</HI> where Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> became &s;o thought|ful,
&s;poke &s;o little, and return'd &s;uch di&s;tracted
An&s;wers, that his Cou&s;in, who never ob&s;erved him
in that Condition before, was &s;everal times going to
ask him the Cau&s;e: but thinking that he might have
&s;ome &s;ecret Engagement upon his hand, and that
pre&s;&s;ing him hard might make him unea&s;y, he re|&s;olved
to take other mea&s;ures; accordingly he &s;et
one of his Servants, a cunning Fellow, to watch
where Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> went, and to give him an ac|count
of his Behaviour. After this <HI>Aguilar,</HI> who
depended on hearing &s;ome News of his Cou&s;in, pre|tended
to have &s;ome urgent Bu&s;ine&s;s, and went
out, to give him the more liberty; but at night his
Valet had no other News to tell him, but that he
took a Walk in a lone&s;ome Garden by the Sea-&s;ide,
and the re&s;t of the day &s;hut him&s;elf up in his Clo|&s;et,
and &s;poke to nobody. This Conduct &s;urprized
the Count, who after having waited three Weeks,
in hopes this Fit would go off, at la&s;t broke the Ice
him&s;elf; telling him, That he had of late ob&s;erved
in his Carriage &s;omething &s;o different from his u&s;ual
Proceeding, that he could no longer forbear &s;peaking
of it; and that if he had no ground for his Melancho|ly,
he ought to prevent that Di&s;ea&s;e's getting too great

an head; offering him at the &s;ame time, if he had
any Change in his Fortune, part of his; and at la&s;t
told his freely, that he ought not to hide any thing
from him, &s;ince he had made both tryal of his
Friend&s;hip and Di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> an&s;wer'd him only with a deep Sigh,
and the Count, who ob&s;erved him with a great deal
of Attention, continuing his Di&s;cour&s;e, &s;aid, &startq;What
can be the matter with you, you are a very ac|compli&s;h'd
Gentleman, your Birth is &s;o noble,
that it is &s;ufficient to u&s;e your Name to create
Re&s;pect; your Father has a good E&s;tate, and al|lows
you very hand&s;omly: in &s;hort, you mu&s;t be
in love, and are unkindly receiv'd.&endq; &startq;Alas! Cou|&s;in,
<HI>reply'd Don</HI> Gabriel, you are too pre&s;&s;ing; can|not
you love me without asking me Que&s;tions?&endq;
&startq;But, <HI>continued he, after &s;ome &s;mall Silence,</HI> I abu&s;e
your Goodne&s;s, and am very &s;en&s;ible nothing is
more engaging than what you have &s;aid to me;
if I have kept my Secret from you, it was purely
out of the De&s;ire I had to pre&s;erve your E&s;teem:
Alas! you can have none for me, after I &s;hall con|fe&s;s
my Extravagance to you. I am in love, I own,
and the Pa&s;&s;ion is the more dangerous, &s;ince I
know not whether the Per&s;on, that is the Cau&s;e
of all my Di&s;quiet, merits what I endure for her.
'Tis <HI>I&s;idora,</HI> Don <HI>Lewis</HI>'s Si&s;ter, whom I have never
&s;een, nor perhaps ever &s;hall, &s;ince her Aunt is
jealous of the very Sun that &s;hines on her, and
gives her not the lea&s;t liberty.&endq;</P>
<P>The Count <HI>d' Aguilar</HI> li&s;ten'd to his Cou&s;in with
great A&s;toni&s;hment, and &s;aid to him, &startq;Had you ever
&s;een <HI>I&s;idora,</HI> and loved her, your &s;peaking after
this manner would not have &s;urprized me &s;o much;
but 'tis very odd, that after the long time you have
lived in <HI>Madrid,</HI> and your Travels into <HI>Italy, France,</HI>
and <HI>F$anders,</HI> where you have &s;een very beautiful
Ladies, without having any Inclination for any of
them, you &s;hould at la&s;t run aground all on a &s;ud|den,
and &s;urrender without being acquainted ei|ther
<PB N="9" REF="18">
with the Beauty, Wit, or Humour of her you
have thought of loving.&endq; &startq;For this rea&s;on I was
a&s;hamed and vexed, <HI>reply'd Don</HI> Gabriel, and dur&s;t
not make my Secret known to you; and in the
height of my Misfortune, knew no other Remedy
but that of re&s;i&s;ting my Pa&s;&s;ion.&endq; &startq;Oh dear Friend!
<HI>&s;aid the Count,</HI> tru&s;t not to that; I &s;ee your time is
come, you are a Rebel that thought your&s;elf in|&s;en&s;ible,
and Love has a mind to puni&s;h you, by
creating a Tenderne&s;s in you for what you have
never &s;een.&endq; &startq;I beg of you not to banter me, <HI>an|&s;wer'd
Don</HI> Gabriel, for I never had le&s;s Inclination
to laugh in all my Life; if you will not talk of
this Affair more &s;eriou&s;ly, I'd rather we left off
the Di&s;cour&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>The Count <HI>d' Aguilar</HI> told him, That <HI>I&s;idora</HI> was
neither an Infanta of <HI>Spain,</HI> nor a Sovereign Prin|ce&s;s,
and that, in all appearance, if he demanded
her, &s;he would not be refu&s;ed; which plea&s;ed him
mightily: &startq;I believe &s;o, as well as you, <HI>an&s;wer'd
Don</HI> Gabriel; but I have another Chimera come
in my Head, as difficult to &s;trive with as my
Pa&s;&s;ion; that is, if my Services &s;hould not be a|greeable
to her, if &s;he &s;hould not love me at fir&s;t,
if I owe the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her to either her Obe|dience
to her Relations, or my Quality and E&s;tate,
and not to her Tenderne&s;s, I &s;hall never be &s;ati&s;|fied.&endq;
&startq;All this &s;eems to me very &s;ingular, <HI>&s;aid
Aguilar;</HI> I pity you, and am &s;orry to &s;ee you in
&s;uch Torments, without being in a Condition to
ea&s;e them: but if what I have told you all my
Life, that I am entirely yours, and if you can
imagine any way how I may be &s;erviceable,
you may depend on me.&endq; At the&s;e words, Don
<HI>Gabriel</HI> embraced his Cou&s;in, and &s;aid to him, &startq;Re|member
you keep your word, for in a little time
I may have occa&s;ion to try you.&endq;</P>
<P>It was late when they parted, and Don <HI>Gabriel</HI>
thought him&s;elf le&s;s unhappy, &s;ince he had found
a Confidant, and the Co$nt was overjoy'd to know
<PB N="10" REF="19">
what was the matter with his Friend, that he might
either oppo&s;e or flatter his Pa&s;&s;ion, as he judged
mo&s;t proper. After this fir&s;t Confe&s;&s;ion, Don <HI>Gabriel</HI>
made no difficulty to declare his Thoughts to <HI>Agui|lar,</HI>
but &s;ought him out as an Ea&s;e to his Pains, and
was overjoy'd not to find him of a contradictory
Temper, it being di&s;plea&s;ing always to meet with
continual Remon&s;trances.</P>
<P>Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> was willing to wait &s;ome time, to
&s;ee if his Rea&s;on would not remedy the Di&s;orders
of his Heart; but perceiving that the more re|&s;i&s;tance
he made, the weaker he grew, and that the
Idea he had form'd of <HI>I&s;idora</HI> &s;till per&s;ecuted him,
he re&s;olved to endeavour to &s;ee her, and going in|to
the Count <HI>d' Aguilar</HI>'s Chamber at Day-break, &s;aid
to him, &startq;Dear Cou&s;in, I mu&s;t go to <HI>Gallicia.</HI>&endq; &startq;I
under&s;tand you, <HI>reply'd the Count,</HI> in &s;earch after
<HI>I&s;idora;</HI> but how do you think to come at what
you de&s;ire?&endq; &startq;I think, <HI>an&s;wer'd Don</HI> Gabriel,
when we come there, to &s;et the Hou&s;e on fire,
and by the means of that Di&s;order to get into her
Chamber, and carry her away in my Arms.&endq; &startq;In|deed
Don <HI>Gabriel, &s;aid the Count,</HI> you are not pru|dent
to begin by a Fire, that will be &s;o prejudicial
to one or your be&s;t Friends: con&s;ider fir&s;t, that
you will do don <HI>Lewis</HI> a great injury, by burning
his Hou&s;e, which is one of the fine&s;t in that Pro|vince;
and then, that your dear <HI>I&s;idora</HI> may be
&s;tifled by the Smoke or Flames, and perhaps you
may both peri&s;h: therefore I think this is the
mo&s;t dangerous Expedient you could have thought
of.&endq; &startq;I de&s;ign'd, <HI>reply'd Don</HI> Gabriel, to have ta|ken
the E&s;tate as a Part of her Fortune, and &s;o
have done Don <HI>Lewis</HI> no wrong; but &s;ince you
&s;eem &s;o a$er&s;e to this Propo&s;al, I will decline it,
provided you find out a better, that nothing may
retard our Journey.&endq; &startq;My Opinion is, <HI>&s;aid the
Count,</HI> to take Po&s;t to the nighe&s;t Town to the
Hou&s;e, and to carry with us &s;ome Pilgrims Habits
to di&s;gui&s;e our&s;elves, that we may not be known,
<PB N="11" REF="20">
le&s;t we &s;hould be &s;urprized on the Road to <HI>Com|po&s;tella,</HI>
where People &s;tay &s;ometimes &s;ome Hours.&endq;
&startq;Some Hours! <HI>&s;aid Don</HI> Gabriel, how do you think
I can manage my Affairs in that time?&endq; &startq;Oh I
have thought of an admirable way, <HI>&s;aid the Count
laughing;</HI> and that is, You &s;hall feign your&s;elf
dead, and then nobody will pre&s;s you to be gone.&endq;
&startq;I know very well, <HI>reply'd Don</HI> Gabriel, (who could
not bear a Je&s;t as he was u&s;ed) that you turn e|very
thing into Ridicule, and for that rea&s;on I'll
hold my tongue.&endq;</P>
<P>The Count perceived, but a little too late, That
Joking was not always &s;ea&s;onable; and reflecting
that 'twas better to &s;acrifice a good Je&s;t to his
Friend, than his Friend for a Je&s;t, he de&s;ired his
Cou&s;in to pardon that Sally: &startq;But to return to our
Bu&s;ine&s;s in hand, <HI>continued he,</HI> I fancy it would not
be ami&s;s for one of us to pretend to be wounded,
perhaps the old Aunt may have more Charity for
Pilgrims than other Folks, and will take care of
us.&endq; Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> approved of this Thought, and
lo&s;t not a moment's time to give the nece&s;&s;ary Or|ders
for the Habits, and &s;et out with his Cou&s;in two
days afterwards. For the Count <HI>d'Aguilar,</HI> he was
no way inferiour to Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> either in his Shape
or Mien; they had both a noble Air, and were Men
of as much Wit and Politene&s;s as any in <HI>Spain.</HI>
Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> had a mo&s;t delicate Voice, and the
Count plaid on the Harp and Guittar as well as
the be&s;t Ma&s;ter: They had learnt to ride the great
Hor&s;e and dance in <HI>France,</HI> and under&s;tood &s;everal
Languages as well as their own; in &s;hort, they
were two well-accompli&s;h'd Gentlemen. And &s;uch
as I have here repre&s;ented them, they went to Don|na
<HI>Juana</HI>'s with their Hair put under their great
Hats, cover'd all over with Shells, for they had
left their Pilgrim's-Staff, their Caleba&s;&s;es, and all
their other Equipage that they u&s;ed in this their
Di&s;gui&s;e, with a Servant at <HI>Ciudad-Rodrigo,</HI> a Village
hard by: and that they might arrive there in the
<PB N="12" REF="21">
Evening, to be the more ea&s;ily receiv'd, they went
into a Wood, the Avenues of which &s;erved for
Walks to the Ca&s;tle, and were parted by little
Brooks, which fre&s;hen'd the Gra&s;s, and made it al|ways
green; where the Trees, which had &s;tood
there time out of mind, and were Sancturies for
the Birds, by their Boughs mixing one within ano|ther,
form'd mo&s;t plea&s;ant Shades.</P>
<P>&startq;What a &s;weet Abode is here? <HI>cry'd Don</HI> Gabriel
<HI>to the Count;</HI> how happy &s;hould I be, if I could
live here with the Per&s;on whom I adore? But
this flattering Thought carries me too far, when
I con&s;ider I have not yet any Pretence for my Pa&s;|&s;ion,
and may have le&s;s in the end.&endq; &startq;You mu&s;t
not de&s;pair of your good Succe&s;s, <HI>reply'd the Count,</HI>
if it was not for that Caprice of yours, of being
beloved before you are known, 'tis certain your
Name would overcome the greate&s;t Difficulties,
and it would not be long before you might be hap|py.&endq;
What would you have me to do? <HI>reply'd Don</HI>
Gabriel; I cannot help it, I mu&s;t make &s;ome im|pre&s;&s;ions
on <HI>I&s;idora</HI>'s Heart, before &s;he knows who
I am.&endq; 'The Count <HI>d' Aguilar</HI> was ready to die with
laughing, but conceal'd it; and continuing their
Walk, they came to a little Box, &s;ome little di&s;tance
from the Ca&s;tle, on that &s;ide of the Park that join'd
to the Wood. All was &s;ilent, and our Pilgrims
approach'd without any Noi&s;e, and placing them|&s;elves
under the Windows, which were open, they
heard &s;ome Per&s;ons talking, but could not under|&s;tand
what they &s;aid; when they had made an end
of their Di&s;cour&s;e, one of the Ladies, rai&s;ing her
Voice, &s;aid, &startq;I have a great deal more to &s;ay on
this Subject, if my Aunt was not alone; but &s;he is
too great a Lover of Romances to deprive me of
the Plea&s;ure of hearing them.&endq; Hereupon they
got up and went away, when Don <HI>Gabriel,</HI> who had
a great $e&s;ire to have detain'd tho&s;e Ladies, and
enter'd into a Di&s;cour&s;e with them, &s;aid to the
<PB N="13" REF="22">
Count <HI>d' Aguilar,</HI> &startq;I'll &s;ing &s;ome amorous Complaint,
it may be my Voice may bring us acquainted.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You have forgot, <HI>reply'd the Count,</HI> that one of
us was to feign being wounded, and this manner
of complaining and asking A&s;&s;i&s;tance will be very
novel.&endq; &startq;That's true, <HI>&s;aid Don</HI> Gabriel, but I can
always excite a Curio&s;ity &s;ooner by a Song, than
by Groans; but, <HI>continued he,</HI> I ought to follow our
fir&s;t Project, for if my De&s;igns had not their de|&s;ired
Succe&s;s, I &s;hould have blam'd my&s;elf.&endq; &startq;That
we may do every thing to the be&s;t advantage, <HI>&s;aid
the Count,</HI> I'll be the wounded Per&s;on, and you
&s;hall be the <HI>Orpheus;</HI> therefore begin, perhaps our
Matters may &s;ucceed better than we dare hope
for.&endq; Whereupon Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> bethought him&s;elf
of the mo&s;t moving Air and tender Words, and rai|&s;ing
his Voice a little, the Echoes &s;eem'd to he&s;i|tate
whether they &s;hould return any An&s;wer; the
Nightingales li&s;ten'd, and the Zephirs held their
Breath; and for the Count <HI>d' Aguilar,</HI> he was amazed,
his Cou&s;in's Voice was &s;o much embeli&s;h'd.</P>
<P><HI>I&s;idora, Melanthia,</HI> and a young Lady of Fa&s;hion,
named <HI>Ro&s;a,</HI> were ju&s;t then walking &s;oftly towards
the Ca&s;tle; but as &s;oon as they heard that Voice,
which they thought was wonderful fine, they ran
to the Windows of the little Box with &s;o much pre|cipitation,
that Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> and the Count made no
di&s;pute but that they came to hear them; and you
may naturally &s;uppo&s;e our Lover neglected nothing
whereby he could charm tho&s;e Ladies: but as he
was often &s;aying to his Cou&s;in, &startq;I &s;hall regret very
much the pains I take, if <HI>I&s;idora</HI> is not there;&endq;
they were &s;uddenly &s;urprized by a Con&s;ort, play'd
by <HI>I&s;idora</HI> on the Harp, <HI>Melanthia</HI> on the Guittar,
and <HI>Ro&s;a</HI> on the Viol. The Room appear'd full of
Lights, and Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> thought he &s;hould almo&s;t
die with Joy, flattering him&s;elf that he had &s;ome
&s;hare in that Symphony and tho&s;e Lights. But not
&s;atisfy'd with hearing, he endeavour'd to find out
a way to gratify his Eyes, on which occa&s;ion his
<PB N="14" REF="23">
Activity was of no &s;mall u&s;e to him; for by climb|ing
up into a Tree, he ea&s;ily ob&s;erved the Ladies
playing on their In&s;truments, but was at too great
a di&s;tance to di&s;cern their Features.</P>
<P>They play'd not long, chu&s;ing rather to hear that
Voice which had charm'd them, than their own
Mu&s;ick; when li&s;tening, they heard the Count <HI>d' A|guilar,</HI>
who began to complain, &s;ay, &startq;'Tis impo&s;&s;i|ble,
Brother, to expre&s;s what I endure; the Pains
of my Wound increa&s;e, and if we are forced to
&s;pend our Night here, I &s;hall be dead before

(&s;peaking loud enough to be heard) unle&s;s
we go to this Ca&s;tle, to beg their A&s;&s;i&s;tance?&endq;
&startq;The&s;e are undoubtedly Travellers, <HI>&s;aid</HI> I&s;idora,

what they &s;hould do.&endq; Hereupon <HI>I&s;idora,</HI> rai&s;ing
her Voice a little, &s;aid, &startq;You ought to think of
leaving this Wood, for it is oftentimes very dan|gerous.&endq;
When Don <HI>Gabriel,</HI> who made all the ha&s;te

from <HI>St. Jacques,</HI> we were attack'd by &s;ome Rogues,
who have wounded my Brother in his Side, who
notwith&s;tanding has made a &s;hift to walk thus far
a-foot; but finding his Spirits fail him, I have laid
him under one of the&s;e Trees, not knowing what
to do with him in &s;o dark a Night.&endq; &startq;Indeed we
pity you, <HI>continued</HI> I&s;idora, and will do what we

After the&s;e words, they &s;hut their Windows, put
out the Candles, and ran into Donna <HI>Juana</HI>'s Cham|ber,

<P>The Almoner, who had already &s;ome Affection

a very hand&s;ome Apartment, which was that
Don <HI>Lewis</HI> lay in, when there, and order'd a good
Supper for them; withal telling them, That Donna

<P>All this while the Count, whom I &s;hall now call

<P>While they had all this Di&s;cour&s;e, the Count was
both hungry, hot, and weary: for the old Lady,
who would not &s;uffer him to eat a bit, as I &s;aid be|fore,
had al&s;o cover'd him up &s;o clo&s;e, that he was

Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> con&s;ented to, without any reluctance;
and tho he and the Count regretted the parting
with <HI>I&s;idora</HI> and <HI>Melanthia,</HI> they were both &s;o glad
to get rid of the trouble&s;ome Aunt, that they for|warded
their Departure, as much as the Parts they
acted and their Re&s;pect would allow.</P>
<P>When they were left alone with the Almoner,
they gave him &s;o many good Rea&s;ons, telling him
that he mu&s;t either eat or die, that he, being a
good hone&s;t Fellow that loved Pilgrims, and not
having &s;upped, &s;at down with them at the Table;
where the Count made amends for what he endured
in bed, and Don <HI>Gabriel,</HI> who eat not with a good
Appetite while <HI>I&s;idora</HI> was by, follow'd his example
&s;o well, that they clear'd all before them. When
he was gone, and they at liberty, Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> ask'd
the Count, if he ever &s;aw any thing equal to <HI>I&s;i|dora?</HI>
&startq;She is a perfect Beauty, <HI>an&s;wer'd the other:</HI>
but <HI>Melanthia</HI> in my opinion has an inexhau&s;tible
Store of Charms; her Shape and Complexion, the
Evenne&s;s of her Teeth, the Brightne&s;s of her fine
black Hair, and that Air of Sprightline&s;s and Mirth
di&s;pers'd all over her Per&s;on, are as touching and
engaging as the langui&s;hing Softne&s;s of <HI>I&s;idora.</HI>&endq;
I am very glad, <HI>reply'd Don</HI> Gabriel, that you was
not taken by her incomparable Beauty.&endq; &startq;I don't

&s;uperiour Merit, &s;ince you would not have me
your Rival. Heaven forbid! <HI>cry'd Don</HI> Gabriel; I
believe I love her &s;o well, that I could die for
her.&endq; &startq;But &s;ince you have taken upon you to be
an A&s;trologer, <HI>an&s;wer'd the Count,</HI> when you come
to your Fortune-telling, do me all the &s;ervice you
can with <HI>Melanthia.</HI>&endq; &startq;What would you at la&s;t give
<PB N="21" REF="30">
way to Love, <HI>&s;aid Don</HI> Gabriel <HI>&s;miling?</HI>&endq; &startq;I have
no great De&s;ire to it, <HI>an&s;wer'd the Count,</HI> but let
what will happen, do me all the &s;ervice you can.&endq;
&startq;Well, <HI>&s;aid Don</HI> Gabriel, pre&s;erve your Liberty
if you can. Alas! what would you have me do
here? <HI>reply'd he &s;omewhat angrily:</HI> Ought not I to
have &s;omething to make me amends for what I
endure with Donna <HI>Juana?</HI> for not to deceive you,
<HI>added he,</HI> &s;he has almo&s;t tired my Patience, the
Intere&s;t &s;he takes in my Health hath already in|jur'd
me but too much.&endq; As it was then late,
they left off their Di&s;cour&s;e, and Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> re|tired
to his Chamber, which was &s;eparated from
the Count's by a large Hall; where he, as well as
his Cou&s;in, &s;lept as little as People in love are u&s;ed
to do.</P>
<P>For <HI>I&s;idora</HI> and <HI>Melanthia,</HI> they follow'd their Aunt
to her Chamber, afterwards retired to their own,
and that Night lay together, that they might talk
away &s;ome Hours; but when they were got into
bed, in&s;tead of talking, they did nothing but tum|ble,
and to&s;s, and &s;igh. &startq;What is the matter you
don't &s;leep, <HI>&s;aid</HI> I&s;idora, are you not well?&endq; &startq;But
what's the matter you don't go to re&s;t?&endq; <HI>reply'd</HI> Me|lanthia.
At that <HI>I&s;idera</HI> fetch'd a deep Sigh, and
return'd no An&s;wer. Some time after <HI>Melanthia</HI>
hearing <HI>I&s;idora</HI> &s;igh again, &s;aid, (embracing her)
&startq;You are very melancholy, and would fain hide it
from me; what dare not you tru&s;t me?&endq; &startq;I ne|ver
was &s;o in my life before, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> but my
Tears are &s;o unworthy of me, that I am a&s;hamed
of them.&endq; &startq;You fright me, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Melanthia, for
tho I don't comprehend what you would &s;ay, yet
I am per&s;uaded you are not &s;o melancholy with|out
a Cau&s;e; therefore if you love me, remove
my Fears, and let me know your Griefs.&endq; &startq;I &s;wear
to you Si&s;ter, <HI>reply'd</HI> I&s;idora, I cannot tell what
ails me; but &s;ince you will have me be more par|ticular,
I mu&s;t own, that after I had been &s;ome
time in the Room with tho&s;e Travellers, I found
<PB N="22" REF="31">
my&s;elf very much concern'd for him that is
wounded, he appear'd &s;o charming in his mean
Habit, that I &s;aid to my&s;elf, What would this
young Man be, were he of Quality, and finely
dre&s;s'd, &s;ince he has &s;uch a noble Mien in his or|dinary
Clothes? I flatter'd my&s;elf that he might
be a Per&s;on of Birth and Family in that Di&s;gui&s;e;
but when his Brother told my Aunt that they
were Mu&s;icians, it went like a Dagger to my
Heart, that I &s;hould have any Inclination for a
Man &s;o much below me, I that was never guilty
of any &s;uch Weakne&s;s for any Man before.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Alas! Si&s;ter, <HI>cry'd</HI> Melanthia, I have too great a
&s;hare in your Complaints to be in&s;en&s;ible: Don
<HI>Gabrie!</HI> has charm'd me with his Voice, and I was
lo&s;t when I ob&s;erved, for all that ridiculous Pil|grim's
Habit, a good Shape, regular Features, and
an Air and Mien not to be equalled in Per&s;ons of
the be&s;t Rank.&endq; &startq;They are amiable, that's true,
<HI>reply'd</HI> I&s;idora, but Heaven defend us from looking
on them any otherwi&s;e than as Mu&s;icians; and I
think we ought to ha&s;ten their Departure.&endq;
&startq;Would you be the Cau&s;e of the poor wounded
Man's Death? <HI>&s;aid</HI> Melanthia:&endq; &startq;No, <HI>an&s;wer'd the

his bu&s;ine&s;s; for I'm per&s;uaded 'tis our be&s;t

&startq;Alas! I'll con&s;ent to it, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Melanthia,
and will &s;econd you with all my heart.&endq; As thus
they talk'd, Day broke, and then they endeavour'd
to get a little Re&s;t.</P>
<P>For Donna <HI>Juana,</HI> &s;he pa&s;s'd the Night as indif|ferently
as any of them, for fear the Pilgrim &s;hould
be wor&s;e than when &s;he left him; and as it was
too late, when they came, to think of a Surgeon,
&s;he &s;ent in the Morning for two of the be&s;t in <HI>Ciu|dad-Real,</HI>
and as &s;oon as they came, carried them
into the Count's Chamber. Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> was with
him when <HI>Juana</HI> and the Surgeons came, and knew
not at fir&s;t but that they were &s;ome of the Dome|&s;ticks,
<PB N="23" REF="32">
till &s;he bid the Count prepare him&s;elf for
&s;ome Operation, telling him that he was in the

While &s;he was thus encouraging the Count, the
Surgeons were preparing all their Materials, as
their In&s;truments, Tents, and Ointment, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and
for the Count, 'tis almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to comprehend
the Confu&s;ion he was in; looking &s;ometimes at Don
<HI>Gabriel</HI> with Eyes full of Rage and Anger, and
&s;ometimes making Signs, as if all would be di&s;co|ver'd:
when Don <HI>Gabriel,</HI> who was not &s;o much
perplex'd, &s;aid to Donna <HI>Juana,</HI> &startq;We never travel,
Madam, without &s;ome of the Powder of Sympa|thy
about us, the Effects of which are wonder|ful,
for I put but a little of it la&s;t Night to my
Brother's Wound, and I believe it will &s;oon be
well.&endq; At that the Surgeons exclaim'd again&s;t it
as a pernicious Remedy, &s;aying, That 'twas all Sor|cery,
and that the holy Inqui&s;ition would not allow
of it. At the frightful Name of the Inqui&s;ition,
Donna <HI>Juana</HI> was for running away, but that the
Count a&s;&s;ured her, That the Powder was prepared
by him&s;elf, and was only a Compound of Simples,
which he would give her the Receipt of. After
this, &s;he de&s;ired the Surgeons might look at his
Wound, whether they did any thing or nothing;
but he not acquie&s;cing with that Reque&s;t, &s;he paid
them for their Trouble, and &s;o di&s;mi&s;s'd them.</P>

<HEAD>The Royal Ram.</HEAD>
<P>IN tho&s;e happy Days, when Fairies were com|mon,
there lived a King who had three beau|tiful
young Daughters, who were all de&s;erving;
but the younge&s;t, who&s;e Name was <HI>Miranda,</HI> being
the mo&s;t amiable, and her Father's Favourite, was
allow'd as many Clothes in a Month, as her Si&s;ters
had in a Year: but &s;he being &s;o generous as to let
them partake with her, it made no difference a|mong&s;t
them.</P>
<P>The King having bad Neighbours, who, tired
with a long Peace, obliged him to rai&s;e an Army,
and to take the field, left his Daughters with a Go|vernant
in a Ca&s;tle, where they might hear News
from him every day; and when he had &s;ubdued his
Enemies, and drove them out of his Dominions,
came to the Ca&s;tle to &s;ee his <HI>Miranda,</HI> whom he
doated on. The three Prince&s;&s;es be&s;poke them|&s;elves
every one a Robe of Sattin; the Elde&s;t's was
Green adorn'd with Emeralds, the Second's was
Blue &s;et off with Turquoi&s;es, and the Younge&s;t's
White bedeck'd with Diamonds: and in the&s;e Dre&s;|&s;es
they went to meet the King, and congratulate
him on his Victories.</P>
<P>When he &s;aw them &s;o beautiful and gay, he em|braced
them all tenderly, but e&s;pecially <HI>Miranda.</HI>
After a magnificent Entertainment that was &s;erved
up, the King, who loved to draw Con&s;equences from
the mo&s;t trivial Matters, when they were ask'd, the
Elde&s;t, why &s;he put on a green Gown? &startq;Sir, <HI>&s;aid

Green might expre&s;s my Joy, and the Hopes of

plea&s;ing you, <HI>&s;aid the Prince&s;s,</HI> and I think I need
no other.&endq; Whereupon the King was mightily
plea&s;ed at her Turn of Thought, and &s;aid, That
&s;ince he had eaten a pretty deal at Supper, he
would not go to bed &s;o &s;oon, therefore he would
have them tell him their Dreams the Night before
his Return.</P>
<P>The Flde&s;t &s;aid, &s;he dreamt he brought her a
Gown, the Gold and Jewels of which were brighter
than the Sun; the Second &s;aid, &s;he dreamt that he

off, and on the Wedding-day held a golden Ewer,
and &s;aid, <HI>Come,</HI> Miranda, <HI>come and w$&s;h you.</HI></P>
<P>The King, who was angry at this Dream, knit
his Brow, and made a thou&s;and wry Faces, and
went into his Chamber, where throwing him&s;elf
upon his Bed, he could not forget his Daughter's
Dream: &startq;This in&s;olent Baggage, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> would
make me her dome&s;tick Slave; I am not amazed
now, why &s;he put on a white Gown with thin$ing

Reflections, but I'll prevent her ill De&s;igns.&endq; Here|upon

to it, le&s;t the King &s;hould take away his Commi&s;|&s;ion,
but promis'd him to perform it. Then going
to the Prince&s;s's Chamber, which he had much ado
to get to, it being &s;o very early, he told her, the
King &s;ent for her; whereupon &s;he ro&s;e pre&s;ently:
a little <HI>Meer</HI> that &s;he call'd <HI>Patypata</HI> held up her
Train, and her young Ape and little Dog, which &s;he
nam'd <HI>Grabgeon</HI> and <HI>Tintin,</HI> ran by her &s;ide.</P>
<P>The Captain of the Guard carried her into the
Garden, telling her, the King was taking there a
little fre&s;h Air and then pretending to look for him,
and not finding him, told her, he was without di&s;|pute
gone from thence into the Fore&s;t. Then
opening the little Door that led into the Fore&s;t,
and Day coming on, the Prince&s;s ob&s;erv'd that her
Conductor &s;hed &s;ome Tears and &s;eem'd melancholy;
Whereupon &s;he &s;aid to him, with an Air of Sweet|ne&s;s,
&startq;What is the matter you &s;eem &s;o much af|flicted
at?&endq; &startq;Alas! Madam, <HI>cry'd he,</HI> who can be other|wi&s;e,
the King has order'd me to kill you here, and
to carry him your Heart and Tongue, or el&s;e he
will put me to death.&endq; At the&s;e Words the poor
Prince&s;s turn'd pale, and fell a crying, and in that
Condition look'd like a Lamb that was going to
the Slaughter; then fixing her Eyes on the Cap|tain,
without any Anger &s;aid to him, &startq;Have you
Courage enough to kill me, who never did you
any Injury in my Life, but rather always &s;poke
to the King in your favour? But if I have de|&s;erv'd
my Father's Anger, I &s;ubmit without mur|muring.
Alas! I have &s;hewn him but too much
Love and Re&s;pect, for him to complain without in|ju&s;tice.&endq;
&startq;Fear not, fair Prince&s;s, <HI>&s;aid the Officer,</HI> I'll
&s;ooner &s;uffer the Death I am threaten'd with, than
be guilty of &s;o barbarous an Action; but when I
am gone, you will not be more &s;afe: we mu&s;t
find out &s;ome Expedient to per&s;uade the King
you are dead.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="36">
&startq;What way can we find out? <HI>reply'd</HI> Miranda,
$he will not be &s;atisfy'd unle&s;s he &s;ees my Tongue
and Heart.&endq; At that <HI>Patypata,</HI> who &s;tood by, and
heard all without being ob&s;erv'd either by the
Prince&s;s or the Captain, advanc'd boldly, and throw|ing
her&s;elf at <HI>Miranda</HI>'s Feet, &s;aid, &startq;I come, Ma|dam,
to offer you my Life, let me be the Sacrifice;
I &s;hall be but too well pleas'd to die for &s;o good
a Mi&s;tre&s;s.&endq; &startq;I have no need of &s;o tender a Proof
of thy Friend&s;hip, <HI>&s;aid the Prince&s;s,</HI> (ki&s;&s;ing her)
thy Life ought now to be as dear to me as my
own.&endq; Whereupon <HI>Grabugeon</HI> came forward, and
&s;aid, &startq;You are in the right, my Prince&s;s, to love &s;o
faithful a Slave as <HI>Patypata;</HI> &s;he may be more
&s;erviceable to you than I can, therefore I offer
you my Heart and Tongue with joy.&endq; &startq;Oh my
pretty <HI>Grabugeon, reply'd</HI> Miranda, I cannot bear
the thoughts of taking thy Life away.&endq; With
that <HI>Tintin</HI> cry'd out, that it was in&s;upportable to
&s;o faithful a Dog as he was, that any other but him
&s;hould lay down their Life for his Mi&s;tre&s;s, and
thereupon aro&s;e a great di&s;pute between <HI>Patypata,
Grabugeon</HI> and <HI>Tintin:</HI> in &s;hort, <HI>Grabugeon</HI> being quicker
than the re&s;t, climb'd up to the top of a high Tree,
and threw him&s;elf down and broke his Neck;
and the Captain of the Guard with a great deal
of Per&s;ua&s;ion got leave of the Prince&s;s to cut out
his Tongue, but it prov'd too &s;mall for to venture
to cheat the King with it.</P>
<P>&startq;Alas! my poor little Ape, <HI>&s;aid the Pri$ce&s;s,</HI> thou
ha&s;t lo&s;t thy Life without doing me any Service!&endq;
&startq;That Honour is re&s;erv'd for me, <HI>interrupted the</HI>
Moor;&endq; and at the &s;ame time cut her Throat with
the Knife that <HI>Grabugeon</HI>'s Tongue was cut out with.
The Officer was for carrying her Tongue, but that
it was too black to think of it. &startq;How unfortunate
am I, <HI>&s;aid the Prince&s;s, weeping,</HI> thus to lo&s;e what
I love, and not to be one whit the better for it.&endq;
&startq;If you had accepted of my Propo&s;ition, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Tintin,
you would have had none to have griev'd for but
<PB N="28" REF="37">
me, and I &s;hould have had the Satisfaction of be|ing
regretted alone.&endq; Whereupon <HI>Miranda</HI> ki&s;s'd
her little Dog, and cry'd and griev'd &s;o much, that
&s;he &s;woon'd away, and when &s;he came to her&s;elf,
found her Dog dead, her Conductor gone, and &s;he
herself left with her three dead Favourites; which
&s;he buried in a hole that was ready dug hard by
a Tree, and then bethought her&s;elf of her own
Security.</P>
<P>As the Fore&s;t was not far from her Father's Court,
it was not &s;afe for her to &s;tay there long, le&s;t &s;he
&s;hould be known to &s;ome of the Pa&s;&s;engers, there|fore
&s;he made all the ha&s;te &s;he could to get out of
it; but the Fore&s;t was &s;o large, and the Sun &s;o hot,
that &s;he was ready to die with Heat, Fear and
Wearine&s;s; and was in continual Apprehen&s;ions le&s;t
her Father &s;hould follow and kill her. But &s;till con|tinu'd
going forwards, making lamentable Com|plaints,
having her Gown almo&s;t tore off, and her
Skin &s;cratch'd by the Thorns and Brambles. At
la&s;t hearing the bleating of Sheep, &startq;Without doubt,
<HI>&s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf,</HI> here are &s;ome Shepherds with
their Flocks, who may direct me to &s;ome Hamlet
where I may di&s;gui&s;e my&s;elf in &s;ome Country-Dre&s;s.
For alas! <HI>continued &s;he,</HI> Princes are not al|ways
the mo&s;t happy: Who believes that I am a
Run-away, that my Father without any cau&s;e or
rea&s;on &s;eeks my Life, and that I to &s;ave it mu&s;t be
fore'd to di&s;gui&s;e my&s;elf?&endq; While &s;he was making
the&s;e Reflections, &s;he arriv'd at the place from
whence &s;he heard the bleating: but how great was
her Surprize, when &s;he came to a &s;pacious Plain,
to &s;ee a large Ram as white as Snow, his Horns
were gilt, a Garland of Flowers was fa&s;ten'd about
his Neck, his Legs were adorn'd with Bracelets of
Pearl of a prodigious &s;ize, and he was laid on
Orange-Flowers, and &s;haded from the Heat of the
Sun by a Pavillion of Cloth of Gold! An hundred
Sheep finely adorn'd were waiting about him, &s;ome
drinking Coffee, Sherbet and Lemonade; others
<PB N="29" REF="38">
$ting Strawberries and Cream, and Sweatmeats;
$$d others again playing at Lan&s;quenet and Ba&s;&s;et;
&s;ome had rich Collars of Gold with a gallant De|vice,
and &s;ome their Ears bor'd and full of Rib|bons.
<HI>Miranda</HI> was &s;o much amaz'd, that &s;he was
perfectly motionle&s;s, and look'd all about for the
Shepherd of &s;uch an extraordinary Flock, when
the beautiful Ram came bounding and skipping, and
&s;aid, &startq;Approach, divine Prince&s;s, be not afraid of
&s;uch gentle pacifick Creatures as we are.&endq; &startq;What
Prodigy is this, <HI>&s;aid the Prince&s;s,</HI> (&s;tepping back) to
hear Sheep &s;peak?&endq; &startq;Alas! Madam, <HI>reply'd the
Ram,</HI> your Ape and Dog &s;poke, and why is it more
&s;trange that we &s;hould? &startq;A Fairy, <HI>an&s;wer'd</HI> Mi|randa,
be&s;tow d that Gift upon them.&endq; &startq;And
might not the like Adventure attend us? <HI>reply'd the
R$m &s;miling:</HI> but, my Prince&s;s, what brought you
hither?&endq; &startq;A thou&s;and Mi&s;fortunes, <HI>reply'd</HI> Mi|randa;
I am the mo&s;t mi&s;erable Per&s;on in the
World, and &s;eek an A&s;ylum to avoid the Rage of a
Father.&endq; &startq;Come, Madam, with me, <HI>reply'd the Ram,</HI>
I will afford you one, where you &s;hall be known
to none, and be ab&s;olute Mi&s;tre&s;s.&endq; &startq;But I am
not able to follow you, <HI>reply'd &s;he,</HI> I am &s;o weary.&endq;
Whereupon the Ram order'd his Chariot, and &s;oon
after appear'd &s;ix Goats harne&s;s'd to a Gourd-&s;hell,
large enough for two Per&s;ons to &s;it in it with ea&s;e,
and lin'd with Velvet. The Prince&s;s plac'd her&s;elf
in it, admiring an Equipage &s;o novel, and the Ram
got in after her, and then drove to a Cavern's
Mouth, which was &s;top'd by a large Stone, which
on the Ram's touching with his Foot remov'd. Af|ter
which, he told the Prince&s;s &s;he might go down
without any danger, which &s;he would hardly have
ever con&s;ented to, had not her Fear of being taken
prompted her to it; and upon that account &s;he never
he&s;itated, but follow'd her Conductor.</P>
<P>As the Steps were very numerous, the Prince&s;s
thought that &s;he was either going to pay a Vi&s;it to
their Antipodes, or the <HI>Ely&s;ian</HI> Shades; but was much
<PB N="30" REF="39">
more &s;urpirz'd when &s;he di&s;cover'd a va&s;t Plain en|amel'd
with various Flowers, which exceeded all
the Perfumes &s;he had ever &s;melt of, &s;urrounded
with a large River of Orange-flower Water. In
the mid&s;t of this Plain were Fountains of Wine,
Ro&s;a-&s;olis, and other exqui&s;ite Liquors, which form'd
Ca&s;cades and plea&s;ant purling Brooks, and here
and there Holts of Trees, which &s;erv'd for &s;helter
to variety of choice Birds and Fowls, as Partridge,
Quails, Phea&s;ants, Ortolans, Turkies, Pullets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
and in &s;ome parts the Air was darken'd with
Showers of Bi&s;cuits, blanched Almonds, Tarts.
Chee&s;ecakes, Marrow-Puddings, all manner of Sweet|meats
both wet and dry; and in &s;hort, with all
Nece&s;&s;aries for Life, with great plenty of Crown|pieces,
Guineas, Pearls and Diamonds. Without
doubt the rarity and u&s;efulne&s;s of this Rain would
have brought the <HI>Royal Ram</HI> a great many Vi&s;itors,
if he had been de&s;irous of Company; but all the
Writers that mention him, a&s;&s;ure us, that he cho&s;e
to be retir'd, and was as grave as any <HI>Roman</HI>
Senator.</P>
<P>As it was the plea&s;ante&s;t Sea&s;on of the Year when
<HI>Miranda</HI> arriv'd there, &s;he &s;aw no other Palace
than what Chambers, Halls and Clo&s;ets, Orange|trees,
Je&s;&s;amine, Honey-&s;uckles and Ro&s;e-trees
form'd by intermixing their Boughs. The Princely
Ram told <HI>Miranda,</HI> &startq;That he had reign'd Sove|reign
there &s;everal Years, and had &s;ufficient cau&s;e
to be afflicted, but that he refrain'd from his
Tears, that he might not remind her of her Mi&s;|fortunes.&endq;
&startq;Your manner of Treatment, charm|ing
Sheep, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> is &s;omewhat &s;o generous, that
I cannot expre&s;s my Acknowledgment enough $
and I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that what I &s;ee &s;eems
&s;o extraordinary, I know not what to think of
it.&endq; No &s;ooner had &s;he pronouc'd the&s;e Words,
but there appear'd a Troop of beautiful Nymphs,
who pre&s;ented her with Fruit out of Amber Ba&s;|kets;
but when &s;he went nigh them, they in&s;en|&s;ibly
<PB N="31" REF="40">
mov'd from her; and at la&s;t reaching out her
$and to take hold of one of them, and feeling
$othing, &s;he &s;oon perceiv'd they were only Phan|toms.
&startq;Alas! <HI>&s;aid &s;he, weeping,</HI> where am I, and
what were the&s;e?&endq; At that in&s;tant the <HI>Royal
Ram,</HI> for &s;o I mu&s;t call him, returning, having left
her &s;ome Moments, and &s;eeing her &s;hed Tears,
remain'd motionle&s;s, and ready to die at her feet.</P>
<P>&startq;What is the matter with my beautiful Prince&s;s,
<HI>&s;aid he,</HI> have I any way fail'd in the Re&s;pect that
is due to you?&endq; &startq;No, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> but I am not
u&s;ed to live among the Dead, and with Sheep
that talk, every thing here terrifies me; and tho
my Obligation is great to you for bringing me
hither, yet I mu&s;t beg one favour more of you,
to conduct me back.&endq; &startq;Fright not your &s;elf, <HI>re|ply'd
he,</HI> vouch&s;afe to hear me quietly, and you
&s;hall know my deplorable Adventure.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I was born a Prince; a great Race of Kings,
who were my Ance&s;tors, left me in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
one of the mo&s;t beautiful Kingdoms in the World;
my Subjects lov'd me, my Neighbours both fear'd
and envy'd me, and I was e&s;teem'd with &s;ome
Ju&s;tice. My Per&s;on was not indifferent to tho&s;e
that &s;aw me, and being a great Lover of Hunting,
as I was one day pur&s;uing a Stag, and &s;eparated
from my Attendants, the Stag took into a Pond,
I plung'd my Hor&s;e in after him with too much
Imprudence as well as Ra&s;hne&s;s; but in&s;tead of
finding the Water cold, I found it extraordinary
hot, and the Pond becoming dry all on a &s;udden,
there i&s;&s;ued out of a Clift a terrible Fire, and I fell to
the bottom from off the Precipice, where I could &s;ee
nothing but Flames. I believ'd my &s;elf lo&s;t, when
I heard a Voice &s;ay, They mu&s;t be greater Flames
that warm thy Heart, ungrateful Man. Alas!
cry'd I, who's that, that complains of my Cold|ne&s;s?
An unfortunate Wretch, reply'd the Voice,
who adores you without Hope. At the &s;ame
time the Fire went out, and I &s;aw a Fairy whom
<PB N="32" REF="41">
I knew from my Youth, and who&s;e Age and Ugli+ne&s;s
always frighten'd me; &s;he was leaning on $
young Slave of incomparable Beauty, who wa$
loaded with Chains of Gold to denote her Slavery
What Prodigy is this? <HI>&s;aid I to</HI> Ragotte, <HI>which wa$
the F$iry's N$me,</HI> was this done by your Orders$
Alas! by who&s;e Orders el&s;e do you think? <HI>reply'$
&s;he:</HI> have you never known my Sentiments til$
now? mu&s;t I be forced to explain my&s;elf? My Eye
u&s;ed never to fail of Conque&s;t, have they now
lo&s;t all their Power? Con&s;ider how low I &s;toop
'tis a Fairy that makes this Confe&s;&s;ion, and King
are in re&s;pect to them but as Ants.&endq; &startq;I am entire|ly
at your plea&s;ure, <HI>&s;aid I to her, with an Air am
Tone that expr$&s;s'd &s;ome Impatience,</HI> but what is it that
you ask? is it my Crown, my Cities, or my Trea|&s;ures?&endq;
Oh Wretch! <HI>reply'd &s;he di&s;dainfully,</HI> I can
&startq;make my Skullions, when I plea&s;e, greater than
thee; I ask thy Heart, my Eyes have ask'd it a
thou&s;and times, and thou ha&s;t not under&s;tood
them, or at lea&s;t would&s;t not. Wert thou engag'd
with any other, I &s;hould not interrupt thee in thy
Amours, but I have too great an Intere&s;t in thee,
not to di&s;cover the Indifference of thy Heart.&endq;
&startq;Ah! grant me thy Love, <HI>added &s;he,</HI> (&s;hutting her
Mouth, to render it the more agreeable, and rolling
her Eyes about) I will be thy dear <HI>Ragotte,</HI> will
and twenty Kingdoms to that thou po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e&s;t, an
hundred Towers of Gold, five hundred full of
Silver, and whatever thou can&s;t de&s;ire be&s;ides.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Madam <HI>R$gotte, &s;aid I to her,</HI> I beg of you by all
the Charms that render you lovely, to &s;et me at
liberty, and then we'll &s;ee what I can do to
plea&s;e you.&endq; &startq;Oh Traytor! <HI>cry'd &s;he,</HI> if thou lov|ed&s;t
me, thou would&s;t not hone &s;o much after thy
own Kingdom, but would&s;t be content to live in
a Grotto, Wood, or De&s;ert. Don't believe me to
be &s;o great a Novice, thou think&s;t of &s;tealing a|way
but I tell you for your Comfort, you mu&s;t
&s;tay here; and the fir&s;t thing you &s;hall do, &s;hall
<PB N="33" REF="42">
be to keep my Sheep, which have as much Wit,
and &s;peak as well as thou do&s;t.&endq; At the &s;ame time
&s;he brought me into this Plain, where we are
now, and &s;how'd me her Flock, which I looked
on but little, for that beautiful Slave that was
with her took up all my Regard, and my Eyes
betray'd me; which the cruel <HI>R$gotte</HI> ob&s;erving,
flew upon her, and &s;tabb'd her into the Eye with
her Bodkin, and &s;o deprived that adorable Object
of her Life. At this di&s;mal Sight I fell on <HI>R$gotte,</HI>
and clapping my Hand upon my Sword, was going
to &s;acrifice her to the <HI>Manes</HI> of that dear Slave,
had &s;he not render'd me motionle&s;s by her Art. My
Efforts being vain, I fell on the Ground, and endea|vour'd
to kill my &s;elf, to deliver my &s;elf from that
wretched State I was reduc'd to; when &s;he, with
an ironical Smile, &s;aid to me, &startq;I will make you
feel my Power; you are at pre&s;ent a Lion, but
&s;hall e'er long be a Sheep.&endq; Whereupon touching
me with her Wand, I found my&s;elf metamorpho&s;ed,
&s;uch as you &s;ee me, but retain both my Speech, and
tho&s;e Senti$ents of Grief which I owe to my un|happy
State. &startq;Thou &s;halt be five Years a Sheep,
<HI>continued &s;he,</HI> and ab&s;olute Ma&s;ter of this &s;weet A|bode;
while I &s;eparated from thee, and never be|holding
thy agreeable Form, &s;hall think on no|thing
but the Hatred I bear thee.&endq; Hereupon &s;he
di&s;appear'd, and if any thing could have &s;often'd my
Misfortunes, or given any Allay to my Di&s;grace,
'twas her Ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>The Sheep &s;he &s;poke of, acknowledged me to be
their King, told me all their Misfortunes, how
they di&s;plea&s;ed the revengeful Fairy, how &s;he had
compo&s;ed a Flock of them, and that they all under|went
the &s;ame Puni&s;hment. But, <HI>added $e,</HI> when
their Time is expired, they re&s;ume their own
Forms, and leave the Flock; and for tho&s;e who are
<HI>Ragott$</HI>'s Ri$$ls or Enemies, whom &s;he has kill'd,
they abide here an Age before they return in$o
the World again: of which number the young
<PB N="34" REF="43">
Slave is, whom I told you of. I have &s;een her &s;eve|ral
Months together, but &s;he never &s;peaks to me;
and when I approach'd towards her, it grieved me,
when I knew it was only a Shadow: but having
ob&s;erved one of my Flock always by that Phantom,
I under&s;tood he was her Lover, whom <HI>Ragotte,</HI> jea|lous
of the tender Impre&s;&s;ions they made on each
other, had taken from her.</P>
<P>This was the Rea&s;on that made me remove from
that Fairy, and for the&s;e la&s;t three Years think of
nothing but my Liberty; which was what engaged
me to go often into the Fore&s;t, where I &s;ometimes
have &s;een you, fair Prince&s;s, driving your Chai&s;e, like
<HI>Diana</HI> in her &s;ilver Chariot, and other times mounted
on a fiery Steed, riding over the Plains with the
Prince&s;&s;es and Ladies of the Court, and like ano|ther,
always &s;ure to gain the Prize. Alas! if at
tho&s;e times I dur&s;t have &s;poke, what fine things
&s;hould I not have &s;aid! when my Heart offer'd up
its &s;ecret Vows; but how would you have received
the Declaration of an unhappy Sheep like me?</P>
<P><HI>Miranda</HI> was &s;o much concern'd at what &s;he
heard, that &s;he hardly knew what An&s;wer to make;
however, paying him &s;ome Civilities, which gave
him &s;ome hopes, &s;he told him, &s;he &s;hould not be &s;o
much afraid of tho&s;e Shades, &s;ince they were to
come to life again: &startq;But alas! <HI>continued &s;he,</HI> if my
poor <HI>Patypata,</HI> my dear <HI>Grabugeon,</HI> and my pretty
<HI>Tintin,</HI> who died to &s;erve me, were to meet with
the like Fate, I &s;hould not be &s;o much concern'd
here.&endq;</P>
<P>Tho the Royal Ram underwent great Di&s;graces,
yet had he a great many admirable Privileges, &startq;Go,
<HI>&s;aid he,</HI> (to his fir&s;t Squire, who was a Sheep of a
good Mien) go fetch the <HI>Moor,</HI> the Monkey, and
the little Dog, their Shades may divert our Prin|ce&s;s.&endq;
Soon after <HI>Miranda</HI> &s;aw them, and tho
they came not nigh enough to be touch'd by her,
yet their Pre&s;ence was &s;ome Comfort to her. In
&s;hort, the Royal Ram, who was endued with all
<PB N="35" REF="44">
the Wit and Delicacy proper to &s;upport an agreeable
Conver&s;ation, was &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately in love with <HI>Mi|randa,</HI>
that &s;he began to have &s;ome Regard for him,
and to make &s;ome Returns; for what can be di&s;|plea&s;ing
in a beautiful, kind, care&s;&s;ing Sheep, e&s;pe|cially
when known to be a King, who&s;e Metamor|pho&s;e
was to have an end? Thus the Prince&s;s pa&s;s'd
her Days in the &s;weet Expectation of a more hap|py
Fate, while the gallant Ram, who&s;e Thoughts
were &s;olely bent on her, made Entertainments,
Concerts of Mu&s;ick, and did every thing that was
in his power to divert her; his Troop a&s;&s;i&s;ting him
in them, and the Shades contributing &s;omewhat
thereunto.</P>
<P>One Evening, when the Couriers arriv'd, for he
was very fond of News, and always had the be&s;t,
they told him, That the elde&s;t Si&s;ter of the Prince&s;s
<HI>Miranda</HI> was going to marry a Great Prince, and
that the Nuptials were to be very magnificent.
&startq;Alas! <HI>cry'd the young Prince&s;s,</HI> how unfortunate am
I, not to &s;ee &s;uch fine things? I am here under
ground with Gho&s;ts and Sheep, while my Si&s;ter,
who will be dre&s;s'd as fine as a Queen, will have
all the Court made to her, and I &s;hall be the only
one that will not partake of her Joy.&endq; &startq;Madam,
why do you complain, <HI>&s;aid the Royal Ram to her,</HI>
have I deny'd your going to the Wedding? Go
when you plea&s;e, but give me your Word you
will come again; if you deny me this, you &s;hall
&s;ee me expire at your feet, for my Love is too
violent, for me to &s;upport my&s;elf, when I &s;hall
lo&s;e you.&endq; <HI>Miranda</HI> promi&s;ed him nothing &s;hould
prevent her Return; he gave her an Equipage &s;uit|able
to her Birth: &s;he was dre&s;s'd very richly, and
neglected nothing that might &s;et off her Charms;
&s;he got into a Chariot of Mother of Pearl, drawn
by &s;ix Creatures that were half Griffins, and newly
arriv'd from the <HI>Antipod$s,</HI> and was attended by a
great number of Officers, that were richly dre&s;s'd,
and who had been &s;ent a great way to make up her
Train.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="45">
With this Equipage &s;he arrived at the King her
Father's Court, ju&s;t when they were celebrating
the Marriage; as &s;oon as &s;he enter'd, &s;he &s;urprized
all that &s;aw her, with the Lu&s;tre of her Beauty
and Jewels, and heard nothing but Acclamations it
her own prai&s;e. The King look'd at her with
great Attention and Plea&s;ure, which put her into
&s;ome fear le&s;t he &s;hould know her; but he was &s;o
much prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd with her Death, that he had not
the lea&s;t Idea of her. Neverthele&s;s, the Apprehen|&s;ion
of being &s;topt prevented her &s;taying till the Ce|remony
was over, but made her go away &s;uddenly,
leaving a Box of Jewels behind her, whereon the&s;e
Words were writ, <HI>The&s;e Jewels are for the new-mar|ried
Couple:</HI> And when they open'd it, there was no|thing
in it. The King, who had flatter'd him&s;elf
with &s;ome Hopes, and was de&s;irous to know who
&s;he was, was in the utmo&s;t de&s;pair when he knew
&s;he was gone, and order'd his Officers, whenever
&s;he came again, to &s;hut the Gates and keep her.
Tho <HI>Miranda</HI> was not long ab&s;ent, yet it &s;eem'd an
Age to the Royal Ram, who waited for her by a Foun|tain'd
Side in the thicke&s;t of the Fore&s;t, where he
had brought out immen&s;e Riches to offer her as an
Acknowledgment of her Return. As &s;oon as he
&s;aw her, he ran towards her skipping and bound|ing,
care&s;s'd her in his manner a thou&s;and times,
laid him&s;elf down at her Feet, ki&s;s'd her Hands,
told her his Di&s;quiets and Impatience; wherein his
Pa&s;&s;ion affo$ded him &s;o much Eloquence, that the
Prince&s;s was charm'd with it.</P>
<P>Some time afterwards the King married his &s;e|cond
Daughter, and <HI>M$rand$</HI> being inform'd of it,
de&s;ir'd the Ram to let her go again; who at that
Propo&s;ition was extremely grieved: A &s;ecret Fore|&s;ight
prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd him with his Misfortune, but as
it is not always in our power to prevent what we
fore&s;ee, &s;o his Complacency to the Prince&s;s over|balancing
his Intere&s;t in her, he was not able to
deny her. &startq;You will leave me, Madam, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="46">
but this proceeds more from my Ill-Fortune than
from you; I con&s;ent to your De&s;ires, &s;ince I never
could make you a greater Sacrifice.&endq; She a&s;&s;ur'd him
&s;he would &s;tay no longer than &s;he had done before,
that &s;he &s;hould be as much concern'd as him&s;elf to
be detain'd, and de&s;ir'd him not to make him&s;elf
unea&s;y. In &s;hort, &s;he had the &s;ame Equipage as
before, and arrived there ju&s;t as the Ceremony be|gan.
Her Pre&s;ence, notwith&s;tanding their Atten|tion
to the Ceremony, occa&s;ion'd a general Shout
of Joy and Admiration, and drew the Eyes of all
the Princes upon her; who found her Beauty &s;o
extraordinary and uncommon, that they could hard|ly
believe her to be mortal. The King was over|joy'd
to &s;ee her again, and never took his Eyes off
from her but once, to give Orders to lock up all
the Gates. When the Ceremony was almo&s;t over,
the Prince&s;s got up &s;uddenly to &s;teal out of the
Crowd, but was very much &s;urpriz'd and vex'd to
find all the Gates &s;hut. The King went up to her
with great Re&s;pect, and a Submi&s;&s;ion that gave her
&s;ome Encouragement, de&s;iring her not to deprive
him &s;o &s;oon of the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing her, and to
honour him and his Court with her Pre&s;ence.
Then leading her into a magnificent Hall, where all
the Court was, he him&s;elf held a golden Ba&s;on full of
Water for her to wa&s;h her Hands in. At this the
Prince&s;s, who was no longer Mi&s;tre&s;s of her Tran&s;|port,
threw her&s;elf at his feet, and embracing his
Knees, &s;aid, &startq;See, Sir, my Dream is fulfilled, you
have held a Ba&s;on for me to wa&s;h in the Day of
my Si&s;ter's Wedding, without any Misfortune at|tending
you.&endq;</P>
<P>The King &s;oon knew her to be his Daughter
<HI>Miranda,</HI> and embracing her, and &s;hedding &s;ome
Tears, &s;aid, &startq;Alas! my dear Child, can you forget
the Cruelty of a Father, who would have &s;acri|ficed
your Life, becau&s;e he thought your Dream
denoted the Lo&s;s of his Crown: It &s;hall be &s;o,
<HI>continued he,</HI> &s;ince both your Si&s;ters are married,
<PB N="38" REF="47">
and have each a Crown, mine &s;hall be yours.&endq;
And at that in&s;tant ri&s;ing up, he put the Crown on
the Prince&s;s's Head, and then &s;aid, <HI>The Gods pre&s;erve
the Queen</HI> Miranda. Whereupon the whole Court
gave a great Shout of Joy, and her two Si&s;ters came
and hung about her Neck, and embraced her a
thou&s;and times. <HI>Miranda</HI> was &s;o much overjoy'd,
that &s;he both cry'd and laugh'd, embraced one, and
talk'd to another, thank'd the King, and ask'd for
the Captain of the Guards, to whom &s;he was ob|liged
for all; and being told that he was dead, was
very much grieved thereat. When they were at the
Table, the King de&s;ired to hear what had happen'd to
her from the Day whereon tho&s;e fatal Orders were
given; which &s;he acquie&s;cing with, related her whole
Story, without omitting the lea&s;t Circum&s;tance.
But while &s;he was thus engag'd with the King and
her Si&s;ters, the time of her Return was elaps'd,
and the amorous Ram became &s;o unea&s;y, that he
was no longer Ma&s;ter of him&s;elf; and &s;eeing that
&s;he came not again, &s;aid to him&s;elf, &startq;My unhappy
Form of a Sheep is di&s;plea&s;ing to her; alas! too
unfortunate Lover, what &s;hall I do without <HI>Mi|randa?
Ragotte,</HI> inhuman Fairy, how great is thy
Revenge for my Indifference towards thee?&endq; Com|plaining
in this manner, and &s;eeing Night approach|ing,
without any Appearance of his Prince&s;s's com|ing,
he ran to the Palace, and ask'd for <HI>Miranda:</HI>
but as every body had heard of his Adventure, and
were unwilling that the Prince&s;s &s;hould go back
again with him, they refu&s;ed him the &s;ight of her
in &s;o rude a manner, that he fetch'd Sighs, and
made Complaints capable of piercing the Hearts of
all that heard him, except the Soldiers that kept the
Gates; and at la&s;t, overcome with his Grief, laid
him&s;elf down and died.</P>
<P>The King, who knew nothing of this deep Tra|gedy,
prop$&s;ed to his Daughter to ride in a Cha|riot
through all the Streets of the City, to &s;hew
her to her Subjects; but what a di&s;mal Sight was
<PB N="39" REF="48">
it to her, when they got out of the Gates of the
Palace, to &s;ee her dear Sheep &s;tretch'd out on the
Ground, void of Life? She jump'd with precipitation
out of the Chariot, ran to him, cry'd over him, and
bemoan'd the Death of the Royal Ram, which &s;he
knew was owing to her not being &s;o good as her
Word, and in her De&s;pair thought to have partook
of his Fate.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee, that the greate&s;t Per&s;ons, as well as
others, are &s;ubject to the Strokes of Fortune, and
&s;ometimes undergo the heavie&s;t Calamities, when
they think them&s;elves at the height of their De&s;ires.</P>

<HEAD>The Continuation of Don Gabriel.</HEAD>
<P>DONNA <HI>Juana,</HI> who was well read in Ro|mances,
and never was in a better humour,
gave great Applau&s;es to this Story of Don <HI>Gabriel</HI>'s,
pitying the unhappy Ram, and blaming <HI>Miranda</HI> for
her Neglect; but as it was then time for her to
think of dre&s;&s;ing, &s;he took her leave of them,
and retired, and con&s;ulted all the Gla&s;&s;es in her
Apartment with greater Attention than ever. After
&s;he had dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf, &s;he ran into her Nieces
Chamber, and finding them in bed, &s;aid to them,
&startq;Fie! what lazy Creatures are you! I have been
vi&s;iting the Pilgrims already this Morning, and
have heard one of the prettie&s;t Stories in the
world, and have be&s;ides been fifty times all up
and down the Hou&s;e; had you had any Charity,
you would have follow'd my Example, and not
have &s;lept out your Eyes, as you have done: &s;ee
how lively and how broad awake mine are!&endq; At
this, <HI>I&s;idora</HI> and <HI>Melanthia</HI> had much ado to hold from
laughing, for Donna <HI>Juana</HI>'s were &s;o &s;mall, and
withal &s;o hollow, that had they not been red and
inflamed, they would not have been ea&s;ily &s;een:
<PB N="40" REF="49">
but they keeping a &s;trict Guard on their Actions,
told her their Heads ach'd, and that they did
not know whether they ought to go into tho&s;e
Strangers Rooms again. &startq;O! I &s;ee you are wea|ry
of them already, <HI>reply'd Donna</HI> Juana, be|cau&s;e
they are not fine Gentlemen; for my
part, I love them the better becau&s;e they are
poor, &s;ince nothing can be more mi&s;erable than
for People to be at a di&s;tance from their own
Country, and to be robb'd and wounded by
Thieves, which pierces my very Heart: but to
make them amends, I'll make them &s;tay here, to
teach you what my Brother de&s;ired you &s;hould
learn, and will give them as much Money as they
have lo&s;t, for their Trouble.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What, Madam, <HI>cry'd</HI> I&s;idora, will you keep Peo|ple
that you don't know, who are, perhaps, great
Blockheads in their Profe&s;&s;ion, and may &s;ooner
put us out in what we have learnt, than teach us
any more.&endq; &startq;You always oppo&s;e what I de&s;ire,
<HI>&s;aid Donna</HI> Juana <HI>in a Pa&s;&s;ion;</HI> I don't intend to pay
Ma&s;ters to teach you again&s;t your wills, but give
me leave to learn my&s;elf; I &s;hall take a great deal
of plea&s;ure in &s;inging an Air in a pretty ea&s;y man|ner,
and in regaining what I have lo&s;t on my
Guittar: fifty Years ago I play'd very prettily,
and with a little pains I &s;hall bring my Hand in
again, and then you will be glad to hear me.&endq;
<HI>I&s;idora</HI> knowing her Aunt to be very covetous,
thought &s;he had found out a &s;ure way to &s;end
the&s;e Pilgr$$s away, by telling her nothing could
be more ridiculous than to &s;ee them in her Cham|ber
&s;inging and playing on Mu&s;ick in leathern Jac|kets,
with Hats of Sheils, and the Habits they were
in. &startq;You would be very well plea&s;ed that they
&s;hould remain &s;o, <HI>reply'd the Aunt,</HI> that you might
laugh at them; but your Brother has left two or
three Suits of Clothes behind, which will fit them
very well, and I de&s;ign to give them to them.&endq;
&startq;My Brother, Madam, is not perhaps &s;o charita|ble
<PB N="41" REF="50">
as you are, <HI>reply'd</HI> Melanthia.&endq; &startq;So much the
wor&s;e for him, <HI>an&s;wer'd the old Lady ha&s;tily;</HI> there|fore
it is my Duty to &s;end him to Heaven if I
can, and the &s;ure&s;t way is to do charitable Offices
at his Expence.&endq; Upon this &s;he went out, and
left her two Nieces together. &startq;Alas! Si&s;ter, <HI>&s;aid
Melanthia,</HI> my Aunt has lo&s;t her Sen&s;es; can any
thing be more ridiculous, than for her to learn to
dance and &s;ing at her Age? She mu&s;t certainly be
in love with one of the&s;e Strangers, and that is
&s;o prodigious, that I cannot but be amazed at it.&endq;
&startq;What mu&s;t we do, Si&s;ter? <HI>reply'd</HI> I&s;idora <HI>in a melan|choly
Tone:</HI> 'tis our ill Fortune is the cau&s;e of it;
had we no Intere&s;t in this Affair, &s;he would have
been quite the Rever&s;e of what &s;he is now: in
&s;hort, we mu&s;t call up all our Courage to our
aid.&endq;</P>
<P>While they were dre&s;&s;ing, Donna <HI>Juana</HI> was en|gaged
with the Count, who was for getting up, and
eating &s;omething more &s;olid than the Chicken-Broth
&s;he had brought, with cooling and purging
Herbs that were in it; which put him out of all
patience, and made him &s;ay to Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> in a
little Heat, &startq;If the &s;ympathetick Powder cures me
not to-day, I &s;hall certainly run mad.&endq; Donna
<HI>Juana</HI> &s;eeing him &s;o angry, began to be a little
cholerick in her turn, and told him he would not
ea&s;ily recover; that &s;he fore&s;aw a malignant Fever;
that the Vivacity of his Eyes was a &s;ure Token of
it; that in all appearance he had a mind to die;
and that &s;ince &s;he had clear'd her Con&s;cience, he
might chu&s;e whether he would purge or no. By
her grave Air he &s;oon perceived that &s;he was di&s;|plea&s;ed,
and an&s;wer'd, That far from being willing
to die, he never had a greater De&s;ire to live; that
&s;ince &s;he vouch&s;afed to intere&s;t her&s;elf in his Life,
he wi&s;h'd to recover, that he might pay her his Ac|knowledgments,
and declare her Genero&s;ity where|ever
he went. Thus he appea&s;ed the kind old La|dy,
who, to &s;hew him that &s;he would give him no|thing
<PB N="42" REF="51">
thing &s;he would not take her&s;elf, &s;ipped up the
Broth before his face; which had &s;o quick an Effect
upon her, that &s;oon after &s;he was obliged to leave
them, and return to her own Chamber.</P>
<P>&startq;Alas! <HI>cry'd the Count, as &s;oon as &s;he was gone,</HI> was
ever any Misfortune equal to mine, to be thus ex|po&s;ed
to all the&s;e Caprices? if they la&s;t, and you
become not the Object in your turn, I &s;hall de|&s;pair.&endq;
&startq;Poor Cou&s;in, <HI>an&s;wer'd Don</HI> Gabriel <HI>laugh|ing,</HI>
you have experienced how much the Lady in|tere&s;ts
her&s;elf more in you than me: but &s;incere|ly
now, would you have been &s;o &s;ick, had you
&s;ipped the Broth compo&s;ed of tho&s;e purgative
Medicines?&endq; &startq;Compo&s;ed of the Devil and all hi$
Imps! <HI>&s;aid the Court in a Pa&s;&s;ion;</HI> I prote&s;t to you,
if I had not &s;een <HI>Melanthia,</HI> and de&s;ired not to &s;ee
her again, you might have &s;aid and done by your|&s;elf
if you would, for I would have abandon'd you
in your Enterprize. Alas! <HI>continued he,</HI> I &s;poke
too prophetically, when I &s;aid that this Ca&s;tle was
inhabited by a Fairy; but I added, that we drove
her away, and now I find for my Sins we keep
her.&endq; &startq;You make &s;ad Complaints, <HI>reply'd Don</HI> Ga|briel;
be &s;atisfied, I give you my word, my Pow|der
of Sympathy &s;hall heal your Wound up &s;o
well this Night, that the Scar &s;hall not be &s;een.&endq;
I wi&s;h to Heaven, <HI>cry'd the Count,</HI> that you could
cure the Wounds of the Heart &s;o well, for I mu&s;t
tell you again, that which I receiv'd la&s;t Night is
deep, and will be a long time before it is well.&endq;
Oh now I love you! <HI>&s;aid Don</HI> Gabriel, for owning
your Defeat &s;o frankly; you know by Experience,
that I have &s;ometimes de&s;erved your Pity, when
you have deny'd it me.&endq;</P>
<P>Dinner being ready, and Donna <HI>Juana</HI> finding
her&s;elf not in a Condition to go into the Pilgrims
Room; but as her Apprehen&s;ion, le&s;t her Patient
&s;hould eat too much, made her more unea&s;y than
her Phy&s;ick, &s;he &s;ent for her two Nieces, to order
them to take care of him: &startq;Stir not out of the
<PB N="43" REF="52">
Room, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> while his Brother is at Dinner.&endq;
&startq;But, Madam, <HI>an&s;wer'd</HI> I&s;idora, 'tis improper for us
to take the&s;e Charges upon us; we'll call your
Almoner, if you plea&s;e.&endq; &startq;What! <HI>cry'd</HI> Juana, are
you always thwarting me? Have you no Charity
for the Poor, no Goodne&s;s towards Strangers, no
Obedience to your Aunt?&endq; Upon that &s;he flew
into &s;o great a Pa&s;&s;ion, that her Nieces ran away,
and never &s;tay'd to hear what &s;he had to &s;ay to
them. When they had got into a Gallery, that they
were to cro&s;s to go to their own Room, they &s;top'd,
and looking at each other in a melancholy Air, <HI>I&s;i|dora</HI>
&s;aid to her Si&s;ter, &startq;What Whims were ever
like the&s;e of my Aunt, to be thus bent upon fore|ing
us to &s;ee the&s;e Strangers, who appear &s;o dan|gerous
to us? Were they Men of Birth and E|&s;tates,
that had any Love for us, &s;he would hide
us in a Cellar.&endq; &startq;But, Si&s;ter, <HI>interrupted</HI> Melan|thia,
what &s;he does is without any de&s;ign of ex|po&s;ing
our Hearts, I am &s;ure &s;he would be in the
utmo&s;t de&s;pair to find ours in the &s;ame road with
hers; &s;he thinks we are only made to ob&s;erve her
Inclinations: &s;he loves Don <HI>E&s;tevus,</HI> and would
learn to &s;ing and play on the Guittar, and was
it not for the Chagrin that hangs about us, we
&s;hould almo&s;t kill our&s;elves with laughing.&endq; &startq;What
you &s;ay is very true, <HI>reply'd</HI> I&s;idora; but how &s;hall
we re&s;i&s;t the Merits of the&s;e Strangers?&endq; &startq;We
mu&s;t always think them beneath us, <HI>continued</HI> Me|lanthia;
that it is impo&s;&s;ible for our Hearts to be
made for each other; and that it is better to die,
than to have wherewithal to reproach our&s;elves
for.&endq; And at that in&s;tant they thought them&s;elves
&s;o well fortify'd again&s;t their own Inclinations, that
they went boldly into the Pilgrims Chamber.</P>
<P>The Count lay in Bed more like a Man of Quality
than a poor Traveller, his Linen was &s;o very fine;
for they had put up clean Linen and other Nece&s;&s;aries
in a little Cloke-Bag they had brought along with
them: and as Mu&s;icians are very much conver&s;ant
<PB N="44" REF="53">
with Per&s;ons of Quality, and generally dre&s;s well; he
had fine Lace at his Hands, and his Neck and Sleeve$
were tied with cherry-colour'd Ribbons: and for
Don <HI>Gabriel,</HI> who had al&s;o pull'd off his Pilgrims Cap
and comb'd out his Hair, which was very beautiful
he &s;eem'd as worthy of Attention as his Cou&s;in
Though <HI>I&s;idora</HI> and her Si&s;ter were follow'd by
their Women, and had order'd the Almoner to
come after them, yet were they very much emba|ra&s;s'd,
to find them&s;elves in a Chamber with two
Men who were not near Relations, which is an
extraordinary thing in <HI>Spain;</HI> having only their
Aunt's Maggots to give a glo&s;s to this Act of theirs.
<HI>Melanthia</HI> told the Count &s;miling, &startq;That Donna
<HI>Juana</HI> was &s;o much concern'd for his Health, that
&s;he had given her orders to &s;tarve him, and that &s;he
came Expre&s;s to hinder him from eating.&endq; &startq;Donna
<HI>Juana, reply'd he,</HI> (looking on her with all tender|ne&s;s
and re&s;pect imaginable) will ea&s;ily prevent
my eating, by &s;ending you to forbid me; but,
Madam, I doubt by &s;eeing you whether my
Health can be now a&s;&s;urd.&endq; &startq;For my part, <HI>&s;aid
Don</HI> Gabriel <HI>to</HI> I&s;idora, I find &s;o much Compa&s;&s;ion
for &s;ick Per&s;ons, that I &s;hould not be afraid of
being ill my &s;elf.&endq; &startq;Do you find in your&s;elf any
Di&s;po&s;ition towards being &s;o, <HI>reply'd</HI> Melanthia,
(with &s;ome &s;martne&s;s.)&endq; &startq;Yes, Madam, <HI>an&s;wer'd he,</HI>
I have a continual Unea&s;ine&s;s and Pain at my

for we hoped you would &s;ing us one of tho&s;e

&startq;Ah, Madam, <HI>reply'd he,</HI> I'll do all that lies in my

me any thing.&endq; &startq;But, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> &s;hall not we

for then my Wound will be better, and then I
may venture to ri&s;e.&endq; &startq;'Tis now Dinner-time,
<HI>&s;aid</HI> Melanthia, and as &s;oon as you have din'd, we

&startq;Unle&s;s, <HI>an&s;wer'd</HI> I&s;idora, it enters into Donna

&s;hall not come any more.&endq; At that in&s;tant Don
<HI>Gabriel</HI>'s Dinner was &s;et before him; but he was &s;o
taken up with the Plea&s;ure of looking and hearing
her whom he lov'd, that he had lo&s;t his Stomach.
Donna <HI>Melanthia</HI> pre&s;s'd him to eat, and <HI>I&s;idora</HI> kept
talking with the Count, till they bethought them|&s;elves
that they hinder'd Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> from eating
his Dinner, and the Count from ri&s;ing; and as
they were not &s;o great Admirers of fa&s;ting as their
Aunt, but thought the &s;ick Per&s;on might want &s;ome
Nouri&s;hment, they retir'd.</P>
<P>In the mean time, <HI>Juana,</HI> who never had them
out of her Thoughts, &s;ent her Nephew's Clothes,
which he had made a Campaign in, and were after
the <HI>French</HI> Mode. Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> and the Count made
no difficulty to put them on: but laughing in their
&s;leeves, &s;aid to one another, Don <HI>Lewis</HI> mu&s;t be a
Conjurer to know that we are in his Clothes and
in his Apartment; and diverted them&s;elves &s;ome
time after this manner: when Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> chang|ing
the Di&s;cour&s;e, all on a &s;udden, &s;aid, &startq;Have
you ob&s;erv'd with what Indifference the beautiful
<HI>I&s;idora</HI> treats me? &s;he almo&s;t di&s;dains to an&s;wer
me, and I have &s;urpriz'd her Eyes twice or thrice
fix'd in &s;o obliging a manner on you, that I &s;hould
think my &s;elf too happy, had I had that good
Fortune.&endq; &startq;This is a pure Vi&s;ion, <HI>reply'd the Count,</HI>
but I can a&s;&s;ure you that Donna <HI>Melanthia</HI>'s look|ing
at you as much as you believe <HI>I&s;idora</HI> look'd at
me, is not one; for &s;he prais'd your Voice, even
to an Exaggeration, and admires all that you &s;ay.&endq;
&startq;Ah! Cou&s;in, I am afraid you have made here
two Conque&s;ts for one.&endq; &startq;I have a better Opi|nion
of my &s;elf than you, <HI>an&s;wer'd Don</HI> Gabriel,
for I own that &s;he &s;eems to &s;hew me &s;ome Fa|vour,
<PB N="46" REF="55">
but <HI>I&s;idora</HI> recompences you with U&s;ury.&endq; &startq;I
conclude from thence, <HI>&s;aid the Count,</HI> that our not
being &s;o agreeable to one another may be an hin|drance
to the Progre&s;s we might otherwi&s;e have
made in this time.&endq; &startq;But there's one thing trou|bles
me, <HI>added Don</HI> Gabriel, which is, your fancy|ing
to be well to-night, will oblige us to be gone
to-morrow, for what pretence can we make to
&s;tay?&endq; &startq;I'll a&s;&s;ure you, <HI>an&s;wer'd the Count,</HI> I don't
intend to expo&s;e my&s;elf any longer to the impor|tunate
Charity of <HI>Juana:</HI> for I am per&s;uaded that
if &s;he had &s;tarv'd you, and doctor'd you up with
Chicken-Broth as &s;he has me, you would not have
borne je&s;ting with any more than me.&endq; &startq;And you
&s;ay that you are &s;en&s;ible of <HI>Melanthia</HI>'s Charms,
<HI>&s;aid Don</HI> Gabriel, (looking earne&s;tly at him) Good
God! how weak is your Pa&s;&s;ion.&endq; &startq;I am infi|nitely
taken with that amiable Per&s;on, <HI>reply'd the
Count,</HI> if I could flatter my &s;elf with plea&s;ing her:
but I mu&s;t confe&s;s, whatever kindne&s;s &s;he may
&s;hew me, I cannot keep my Bed any longer;
take you your turn now, cry out heartily, and
complain of a Pain in your Side, I'll &s;ay 'tis a
Pleuri&s;y, and Donna <HI>Juana</HI> will bleed you to death.&endq;
As vex'd as Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> was, he could not forbear
laughing at this Imagination: &startq;I have need of all
my Strength, to &s;upport the Coldne&s;s of <HI>I&s;idora,
&s;aid he.</HI>&endq; &startq;And for my part, <HI>an&s;wer'd the Count,</HI> I'll
go to dinner and recruit mine.&endq; Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> bore
him company, and both eat more like hungry
Travellers than Men in love.</P>
<P>The two Si&s;ters went into Donna <HI>Juana</HI>'s Cham|ber
to pay their Re&s;pects to her, and to let her
know how the Pilgrims did; as to her own &s;tate
of Health, &s;he was &s;omewhat better, having en|dur'd
a great deal all the Morning, and told them,
&startq;That if the Powder of Sympathy had &s;uch &s;trange
Effects, as to enable a wounded Per&s;on to ri&s;e &s;o
&s;oon, &s;he wou'd never be without it, but would
u&s;e it in all Di&s;tempers, and get the Secret, both
<PB N="47" REF="56">
for her own &s;ake and all her Friends.&endq; &startq;But, <HI>conti|nu'd
&s;he,</HI> do you think this poor wounded Crea|ture
will be able to come into my Chamber in
the Evening?&endq; &startq;I don't doubt it in the lea&s;t,
Madam, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Melanthia, for he looks extraor|dinary
well, and I am much deceiv'd if they
will not give us a Concert to divert you.&endq; &startq;How
happy am I, <HI>cry'd &s;he,</HI> that Chance brought them
to this Hou&s;e; they have had &s;uch good U&s;age,
that they will have rea&s;on to &s;peak well of us
where-ever they go.&endq;</P>
<P>The Neices went afterwards to their own A|partments,
and after they had din'd, &s;hut them&s;elves
up, that they might talk together with the more
Freedom. &startq;Tell me what News you have, <HI>&s;aid</HI>
Melanthia; how &s;tand you? are you &s;trong or
weak?&endq; &startq;I am the mo&s;t unhappy Per&s;on in the
World, <HI>&s;aid</HI> I&s;idora, to have neither Anger nor
Shame enough to hate a Man that would di|&s;turb
my Quiet. You ob&s;erv'd, <HI>continu'd &s;he,</HI>
that I &s;poke but little, but was altogether given
up to Thought; I examin'd my Sentiments, and
&mdash;I'll &s;ay no more.&endq; There &s;he left off, and
<HI>Melanthia</HI> look'd at her a long time without mak|ing
any reply; when <HI>I&s;idora</HI> &s;aid again, &startq;Don't you
pity me?&endq; &startq;Whatever Compa&s;&s;ion I may have for
you, <HI>reply'd</HI> Melanthia, it cannot equal that I have
for my &s;elf; for I am more &s;en&s;ible of the great|ne&s;s
of my Misfortune, and believe you have
more Re&s;olution.&endq; &startq;Alas! Si&s;ter, <HI>cry'd</HI> I&s;idora,
what &s;ignifies Re&s;olution, when it combats with
our Inclinations?&endq; &startq;But, <HI>added</HI> Melanthia, don't
you think the&s;e Strangers will be over-joy'd to
&s;tay here.&endq; &startq;Their Fortune is &s;o low, <HI>&s;aid</HI> I&s;i|dora,
that I &s;hould not be at all &s;urpriz'd at it.&endq;
&startq;I know not whether they are rich or not, <HI>con|tinu'd</HI>
Melanthia, but certain I am, that were we
to judge of them by their Per&s;ons and Wit, we
&s;hould rather take them to be Men of Quality
<PB N="48" REF="57">
than ordinary Per&s;ons.&endq; &startq;Let us have none of your
Vi&s;ions, <HI>&s;aid</HI> I&s;idora, (interrupting her Si&s;ter) they
are no otherwi&s;e than Mu&s;icians, and have told
us &s;o them&s;elves, and I admire them the more
for their Sincerity.&endq; &startq;I prote&s;t, <HI>an&s;wer'd</HI> Melan|thia,
I cannot believe it, this is not the fir&s;t time
that People have conceal'd their Birth.&endq; &startq;No,
<HI>&s;aid her Si&s;ter,</HI> they are more apt to boa&s;t of it,
and &s;eldom pretend to be of a mean Extract when
they are really Gentlemen.&endq;</P>
<P>Donna <HI>Juana</HI> being &s;omewhat better, &s;ent to
know whether the Pilgrims, if Don <HI>E&s;tevus</HI> was
able, would come to &s;ee her, and alarm'd them
both with this Compliment. &startq;I am afraid, <HI>&s;aid
Don</HI> Gabriel, that it is to di&s;mi&s;s us, and I have
a great mind to lay my &s;elf upon the Bed.&endq; &startq;Oh,
'tis now too late, <HI>reply'd the Count &s;miling;</HI> but there's
no danger of that, for 'tis unlikely that after ha|ving
found my Pul&s;e intermitting la&s;t Night, &s;he
&s;hould turn us out of doors to-day; and I am
very much mi&s;taken if &s;he has not &s;ome Inclina|tion
for one of us. Having thus encourag'd Don
<HI>Gabriel,</HI> he obey'd the Me&s;&s;enger, and went very
carefully, as he &s;aid, le&s;t he &s;hould break open
his Wound.&endq; As &s;oon as Donna <HI>Juana</HI> &s;aw them,
&s;he put on an Air of Gayety that &s;urpriz'd all the
Servants that &s;tood by, made them &s;it by her,
whatever Excu&s;es they made to the contrary, and
de&s;ir'd them to do her the Favour to give her a
Song. The Count who was willing to acquit him|&s;elf
as well as Don <HI>Gabriel,</HI> &s;eeing a Harp hanging
in a Corner of the Room, ask'd Donna <HI>Juana</HI>
leave to play upon it; whereupon &s;he &s;eem'd over|joy'd
and &s;ent for her Neices; who were no &s;ooner
come, but the Count began to &s;ing the&s;e Words,
which he had made on purpo&s;e to rai&s;e the Pity of
the compa&s;&s;ionate <HI>Juana.</HI></P>

<P>Donna <HI>Juana,</HI> who was tran&s;ported with Ad|miration
to hear the young Mu&s;ician &s;ing &s;o well,
and to under&s;tand that he was a Poet too, inter|rupted
him here, and cry'd, &startq;By St. <HI>James</HI> the Pa|tron
of <HI>Spain,</HI> you need not now be afraid of
Rogues, you are in a good Hou&s;e, and &s;hall not
go &s;oon; and when you do go, you &s;hall have a
Guard large enough to &s;ecure you from all Dan|gers.&endq;
At the&s;e Words the two Pilgrims bow'd,
and return'd her a thou&s;and Thanks, and &s;he de|&s;ir'd
them to proceed in their Concert: and 'tis
probable that the young Ladies being &s;o much pre|po&s;&s;e&s;s'd
in their favour, heard them with a great
deal of Plea&s;ure; yet had they not all the Sa|tisfaction
imaginable, &s;ince there was no Intelli|gence
with their Eyes and Sighs. Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> fix'd
his Eyes on none but <HI>I&s;idora,</HI> while &s;he turn'd hers
towards the Count, who gaz'd on <HI>Melanthia</HI> with
unexpre&s;&s;ible Plea&s;ure, who bent her Thoughts
entirely upon Don <HI>Gabriel;</HI> and for Donna <HI>Juana,</HI>
&s;he prai&s;ed the Count, and per&s;ecuted him conti|nually,
when it was not in his power to &s;ay the
lea&s;t obliging thing to her. Neverthele&s;s, &s;he flat|ter'd
her&s;elf as much as any of them, believing
that it proceeded from Re&s;pect, and that he dur&s;t
not give way to the Emotions of his Heart; and
for our two Lovers, who were not deceived in
their Su&s;picions, they were very much di&s;&s;atisfied.
<PB N="50" REF="59">
When they had done &s;inging, &s;he ask'd them, &startq; $word$
they would learn her to play upon &s;ome In&s;truments
and may be, <HI>continu'd &s;he,</HI> I may learn to dane$
when I am cur'd of my Sciatica, which has tor|mented
me above the&s;e thirty Years: don't think
that I am di&s;heartned, I will keep you twent$
Years if I can.&endq; Whereupon they told her, &startq;She
did them too much Honour, that they &s;hould
be very happy if they were to &s;pend their whole
Lives in her Service; but before they engage'd
them&s;elves, de&s;ir'd leave to write to their Fa|ther
to know his Plea&s;ure:&endq; which &s;he, far from
oppo&s;ing, rather commended them for, and taking$
Guittar, and tuning it with her lean &s;hrivel'd Hands,
her Fingers trembled &s;o much when &s;he &s;truck the
Strings, that they had all much ado to keep from
an extravagant Laughter. But for the Count, whom
&s;he had made choice of for her Ma&s;ter, his Gayety
was all laid a&s;ide when he thought of the Indif|ference
of <HI>Melanthia.</HI> When the two Pilgrims had
made an end of their Concert, they retir'd becau&s;e
it was late, and the two young Ladies went to
their own Apartments.</P>
<P><HI>I&s;idora</HI> &s;eeing her Si&s;ter in a deep Melancholy,
&s;aid to her, &startq;I ask you not, dear <HI>Melanthia,</HI> what
ails you, I judge of your Condition by my own;
we are both in love, and to compleat our Mi&s;|fortunes,
meet with no Returns from the&s;e Stran|gers.&endq;
&startq;I cannot believe them in&s;en&s;ible, <HI>reply'd</HI>
Melanthia, but a &s;trange Fatality governs their
Hearts as well as ours; we love not him that love
us, but him that loves us not.&endq; &startq;You are in the
right, Si&s;ter, <HI>interrupted</HI> I&s;idora, we de&s;pi&s;e each
other's Heart; but ought we to be &s;orry for this
Accident? it may be the only means to cure us.
Had their Inclinations an&s;wer'd our E&s;teem, we
&s;hould have had greater Conflicts, whereas now
we may &s;ay to each other, let us not value the&s;e
ungrateful Men.&endq; &startq;Why call ye them &s;o, <HI>reply'd</HI>
Melanthia, they ought rather to be pity'd than
<PB N="51" REF="60">
blam'd, but it may be their Policy to u&s;e us thus.&endq;
&startq;Prudence &s;eems to me to be quite out of play,
<HI>&s;aid</HI> I&s;idora, they mu&s;t have a great deal to di&s;co|ver
no Pa&s;&s;ion; but if they would declare it, by
what Motives do they betray their Thoughts?&endq;
&startq;No, no, my Dear, 'tis all a mi&s;take, Don <HI>E&s;tevus</HI>
lo$es you, and Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> me; and for my Aunt,
&s;he is my Rival, I never &s;aw any one roll their
Eyes about as &s;he has done to-night; I thought
&s;ometimes that &s;he was going into Convul&s;ions.&endq;
&startq;Well, <HI>cry'd</HI> Melanthia, <HI>after having mu&s;ed &s;ome time,</HI>
let Rage perform what Pride was incapable of;
&s;ince the&s;e Strangers know not how to love as they
ought, let us avoid them without tormenting our|&s;elves.&endq;
<HI>I&s;idora</HI> agreed to it, and they were both of
a mind, and nothing was wanting but the Power.</P>
<P>Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> and the Count for their parts com|plain'd
as much of their De&s;tiny, e&s;teeming them|&s;elves
neverthele&s;s happy in gaining the Attention of
<HI>I&s;idora</HI> and <HI>Melanthia;</HI> but were not for being Rivals,
nor changing the fir&s;t Object. &startq;Am not I well re|warded,
<HI>&s;aid Don</HI> Gabriel, for my Pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>I&s;idora?</HI>
when I look at her &s;he ca&s;ts her Eyes on you, and
&s;eems to demand Satisfaction for the Liberty I
take.&endq; &startq;<HI>Melanthia</HI>'s Carriage is the &s;ame, <HI>reply'd
the Count,</HI> I have never receiv'd the lea&s;t Civility
from her; but for her Aunt, you have &s;een how
gracious &s;he is to me.&endq; &startq;Oh! <HI>&s;aid Don</HI> Gabriel,
you are very much favour'd in her Eyes, but it
is not in her power to comfort you.&endq; &startq;It adds
to my Grief, <HI>an&s;wer'd the Count,</HI> to bear it all alone,
for I &s;hall be always oblig'd to &s;hew her &s;ome
Complai&s;ance, which will not be very agreeable
when I have my Head full of Di&s;quiers.&endq; Thus
Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> and the Count &s;pent many Days, with|out
venturing to declare their Sentiments to <HI>I&s;idora</HI>
and <HI>Melanthia.</HI> &startq;I &s;hould have &s;poke before now,
<HI>&s;aid Don</HI> Gabriel <HI>one day to his Cou&s;in,</HI> if I could en|tertain
any Hopes from my Confe&s;&s;ion; but I &s;ee
too well, that I am not beloved by her I love.&endq;
<PB N="52" REF="61">
&startq;I, for my part, can &s;ay nothing, <HI>an&s;wer'd the Court;
Melanth$$</HI>'s Indifference is &s;o great, that I can pro|mi&s;e
my&s;elf nothing from the Per&s;on I repre&s;ent:
a Mu&s;ician is not a Match for a young Lady of
Quality and Worth: why will you conceal your|&s;elf

&startq;What, <HI>a$&s;wer'd Don</HI> Gabriel, would you, to add
to our ill Fortune, have us deny'd by our own
Names?&endq; &startq;What, you &s;et a greater Value by
your Name than your Heart, <HI>reply'd the Count &s;mar$|ly,</HI>
&s;ince you have a greater $egard to the one

&s;ince I pr$mi&s;ed to be guided by you, but you
mu&s;t bring us off with Honour.&endq; &startq;My I ears are
great, and Hopes but &s;mall, <HI>&s;aid Don</HI> Gabriel; and

that I was at quiet, and $y Heart was at ea&s;e, I
&s;hould not be in ha&s;te to be in love again.&endq; As
he pronounced the&s;e words &s;omewhat louder than
ordinary, and heard a Noi&s;e, he was afraid &s;ome|body
was li&s;tening, and looking towards the Do$r,
was &s;urprized to &s;ee Donna <HI>Juana,</HI> who put her
Finger upon her Mouth, and made a &s;ign for him
to follow her into the Gallery. It was ea&s;y to per|ceive
by her Countenance, that &s;omething extraor|dinary
agitated her Mind; and the Count, who
then was &s;en&s;ible how dear <HI>Melanthia</HI> was to him,
began to be afraid Donna <HI>Juana</HI> had heard him,
and would oblige him to go away, which &s;o per|plex'd
him, that he thought twenty times to accu&s;e
and di&s;cover him&s;elf: when &s;he, taking upon her
the Di&s;cour&s;e, &s;aid, &startq;You are in love, Don <HI>E&s;tevus,</HI>
and I am not &s;urprized that you have not con&s;ult|ed
your Rea&s;on, and that the Inequality between
the Per&s;on you love and your&s;elf, deter'd you
not, con&s;idering you are at an Age when Ambi|tion
is very prevalent; but why did you tru&s;t
<PB N="53" REF="62">
your Brother with an Affair, that you ought to
conceal from every body?&endq; Donna <HI>Juana</HI>'s man|ner
of &s;peaking &s;eem'd &s;o obliging, and &s;o much
the Rever&s;e of what it would have been, had &s;he
known her Neice was the Object of that Pa&s;&s;ion,
that he &s;eem'd to doubt whether or no &s;he had
heard all; and being loth to contribute to his own
Guilt, fetch'd a deep Sigh, and return'd no other
An&s;wer. &startq;I under&s;tand but too much by that Sigh,
<HI>continued &s;he, compo&s;ing her&s;elf;</HI> it ought to make me
angry with you, if I was capable of being &s;o:
but in &s;hort, what Views can you have? One of
my Birth and Rank cannot marry a Man &s;o much
beneath her.&endq;</P>
<P>Tho the Count had put on the mo&s;t &s;erious Air ima|ginable,
yet when he under&s;tood what &s;he aim'd at,
he had much ado to keep his Countenance: &startq;The
Sentiments of the Heart, Madam, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> depend
not always upon our&s;elves; I know too well what
my Misfortune has brought me to: I mu&s;t die, that

her Aunt, was for withdrawing; but <HI>Juana</HI> calling
her, &s;aid, &startq;Come and hear the Story which I pro|mi&s;ed

am not to be per&s;uaded but that there is &s;ome Art
in this Plainne&s;s, and have known Per&s;ons, of very
good Ta&s;te and Judgment, who have made them
their Amu&s;ements.&endq; &startq;Madam, I am not at all

who propo&s;e them as grave Subjects, &s;hew their
want of Judgment; and tho&s;e who would write,
or tell them in a lofty high-flown Stile, rob
them of their proper Character: but for my

&s;erious Bu&s;ine&s;s.&endq; &startq;In my opinion, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Melanthia,
they &s;hould be neither too elevated, nor too low,
but &s;hould enjoy a Mediocrity, and &s;hould be ra|ther
merry than &s;erious, and conclude with &s;ome
&s;ort of a Moral.&endq; &startq;This which I am going to tell
you, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Juana, is very plain, but withal very
pretty, which you &s;hall value as you like it; but

of greater things.&endq;</P>

<P>SOME time ago there lived a King and a Queen,
who had managed their Affairs &s;o ill, that they
were driven out of their Dominions; and to &s;up|port
them&s;elves, were forced to &s;ell, fir&s;t, their
Crowns, then their Robes, Linen and Laces, and
afterwards all they had: and when they were re|duced
to the utmo&s;t Poverty, the King &s;aid to the
Queen, &startq;We are forced out of our Kingdoms, and
have nothing left, therefore we mu&s;t think of get|ting
a Livelihood both for our&s;elves and Children;
think a little what we &s;hall do, for my part, I
am entirely at a lo&s;s.&endq; The Queen, who was a
Woman of good Sen&s;e and Wit, ask'd eight days
time to con&s;ider of it; and when they were ex|pired,
&s;aid to him, &startq;Come, don't let us vex and
torment our&s;elves, you &s;hall lay Nets and Snares
for Fowls, and Lines for Fi&s;h, while I make them:
<PB N="55" REF="64">
as for our Daughters, they are three proud idle
Sluts, and fancy them&s;elves &s;till to be great La|dies,
we will carry them a great way off, that it
will be impo&s;&s;ible for them to find their way back
again, for we can never keep them as fine as they
expect we &s;hould.&endq;</P>
<P>The King, who was a kind Father, began to
weep when he &s;aw he mu&s;t part with his Children;
but the Queen being of an imperious haughty Tem|per,
and he being forced to acquie&s;ce with her,
he told her &s;he might ri&s;e early the next Morning,
and carry her Daughters where &s;he thought fit.
While they were thus contriving this Affair, the
Prince&s;s <HI>Finetta,</HI> who was the younge&s;t of the three,
heard them thro the Key-hole, and as &s;oon as &s;he
was inform'd of their De&s;ign, ran as fa&s;t as &s;he was
able to a large Grotto, inhabited by the Fairy <HI>Mer|$ucha,</HI>
her God-mother; but before &s;he went, took
two Pounds of fre&s;h Butter, Eggs, Milk, and Flow|er,
to make a Cake of, that &s;he might be the more
acceptable Gue&s;t. When &s;he fir&s;t &s;et out, &s;he went
very chearfully, but after &s;he had walked &s;ome
time, and the Soles of her Shoes were worn away,
and her Feet began to be gall'd with the Pebbles,
&s;he was &s;o weary, that &s;he &s;at her&s;elf down on the
Gra&s;s, and fell a crying: when a fine <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Hor&s;e
pa&s;&s;ed by ready bridled and &s;addled, with Diamonds
enough on his Hou&s;ings to buy two or three Towns;
who when he &s;aw the Prince&s;s, he fed by her,
bending his Knees, &s;eeming to pay &s;ome re&s;pect to
her, whereupon taking him by the Bridle, &s;he &s;aid,
&startq;Pretty Hor&s;e, if you will carry me to my God|mother
the Fairy, I &s;hould be very much obliged
to thee, for I am &s;o weary, that I am ready to
die away: I promi&s;e you, I'll give you good Corn
and Hay, and litter you down with clean Straw.&endq;
The Hor&s;e bent down before her, and &s;he jumping
upon his Back, he carry'd her to the Fairy's Grotto
as &s;wift as a Bird flies in the Air: for <HI>M$rlucha</HI>
<PB N="56" REF="65">
knowing of her God-daughter's coming, had &s;en$
him for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>When &s;he went in, &s;he made three low Curte|&s;ies,
ki&s;s'd the Hem of her Garment, and then &s;ai$
to her, &startq;Good-morrow, God-mother; how do yo$
do? I have brought you here &s;ome Milk, Butter,
Flower, and Eggs, to make a Cake after ou$
Country Fa&s;hion.&endq; &startq;You are welcome, <HI>Finetta&punc;
&s;aid the Fairy;</HI> come, and let me embrace you.&endq;
Whereupon &s;he ki&s;s'd her two or three times, which
made <HI>Finetta</HI> ready to die with Joy, for <HI>Merlucha</HI>
was a great and renown'd Fairy. &startq;Well, my Girl,
<HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> you &s;hall be my Waiting-Woman, come
dre&s;s and comb my Head;&endq; (which the Prince&s;s
did with all the Addre&s;s imaginable.) &startq;I know
what brought you hither, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Merlucha; you
heard the King and Queen con&s;ulting how they
might lo&s;e you, and you have no mind to be &s;o
&s;erved. Take this Clue of Thred, it will not
break, and fa&s;ten one end of it to the Door of
your Hou&s;e, and keep the other in your Hand;
when the Queen leaves you, it will be an ea&s;y
matter for you, by this Thred, to find your way
back again.&endq;</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s thank'd her God-mother, who gave
her a Sack full of Clothes, all cover'd over with
Gold and Silver, and embracing her, &s;et her upon
the &s;ame Hor&s;e again, who carried her home in a
moment or two; and when &s;he had thank'd her
pretty Hor&s;e for his Trouble, and had bid him re|turn,
&s;he went &s;oftly into the Hou&s;e, and hiding
her Sack under the Bed, laid her&s;elf down, without
taking any notice of what had pa&s;s'd. As &s;oon as
it was Day, the King awaken'd his Wife, and bid
her prepare for her Journey; upon which &s;he got
up, and put on a Pair of &s;trong Shoes, a &s;hort Pet|ticoat,
and white Wai&s;tcoat, and taking a Stick in
her hand, went to call her Daughters; the Elde&s;t
of which was named <HI>Love's-F$ow$r,</HI> the Second <HI>Fair-Night,</HI>
and the Younge&s;t <HI>Auricula,</HI> or <HI>F$ne-Ear,</HI> but by
<PB N="57" REF="66">
way of Nick-name <HI>Finetta.</HI> &startq;I have dreamt to-night,
<HI>&s;aid the Queen,</HI> that we mu&s;t go and &s;ee my Si&s;ter,
where we &s;hall be treated, and be very merry.&endq;
&startq;We'll go, Madam, where you plea&s;e, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Lo$e's-Flower,
(who could not endure to live in a De&s;art,)
&s;o that we go, but 'tis no matter where.&endq; The other
two &s;aid the &s;ame, and taking their leave of their,
Father, they all four &s;et forward on their Journey.&endq;
They went at la&s;t &s;o far, that <HI>F$ne-Ear</HI> began to
fear le&s;t her Clue &s;hould not hold out, for they
had gone a great many &s;core Miles; however, &s;he
always behind her fa&s;tening her Thred in the Bri|ars.
When the Queen thought &s;he had carried
them &s;o far, that they could not find their way
back again, &s;he went into a large Wood, and &s;aid
to them, &startq;Come, my little Lambs, lie down and
take a Nap, while I, like a Shepherde&s;s, will
watch you, le&s;t the Wolf &s;hould &s;urprize you.&endq;
Whereupon they laid them&s;elves down, and fell a|&s;leep,
and the Queen, when &s;he thought them fa&s;t,
took her leave, as &s;he thought, for the la&s;t time;
when <HI>Finetta,</HI> who only &s;hut her Eyes, and pre|tended
Sleep, &s;aid to her&s;elf, &startq;Was I now of a re|vengeful
Temper, I &s;hould leave my Si&s;ters to pe|ri&s;h
here, for they have beat and abu&s;ed me very
much; but however, I will not now for&s;ake them.&endq;
Whereupon awakening them, &s;he told them the
whole Story; at which they fell a crying, and beg|ged
of her to take them along with her, promi&s;ing
to give her all the fine things they had. &startq;I know,
<HI>&s;aid</HI> Finetta, you will not perform what you pro|mi&s;e;
but neverthele&s;s, I &s;hall act the Part of a
kind Si&s;ter.&endq; And thereupon &s;he ro&s;e up, and fol|low'd
her Thred, which brought them home almo&s;t
as &s;oon as the Queen.</P>
<P>When they came there, &s;topping a moment at the
Door, they heard the King &s;ay, &startq;My Heart aches
to &s;ee you all alone.&endq; &startq;Indeed, <HI>&s;aid the Queen,</HI> we
were very much troubled with our Daughters.&endq;
&startq;Well, <HI>&s;aid the King,</HI> had you but brought my <HI>F$|netta</HI>
<PB N="58" REF="67">
back, I &s;hould not be &s;o much concern'd for
the other two.&endq; And ju&s;t then they knock'd at the
Door: &startq;Who's there?&endq; <HI>&s;aid the King.</HI> &startq;Your three
Daughters, <HI>Love's-Flower, Fair-Night,</HI> and <HI>Fine-Ear,</HI>&endq;
<HI>reply'd they.</HI> And at that the Queen trembled, and
&s;aid, &startq;Don't open the Door, for they are certainly
their Spirits; for 'tis impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould be re|turn'd.&endq;
The King, who was as great a Coward
as his Wife, &s;aid, &startq;'Tis fal&s;e, you are not my
Daughters.&endq; Whereupon <HI>Finetta</HI> reply'd, &startq;Look
thro the Key-hole, Papa, and if I am not your
Daughter <HI>Finetta,</HI> I con&s;ent to be whip'd.&endq; At that
the King did as &s;he bid him, and knowing them,
open'd the Door.&endq; The Queen &s;eem'd to be very
glad to &s;ee them, pretending &s;he came back for
&s;omething &s;he had forgot, and de&s;ign'd to have gone
to them again.</P>
<P><HI>Finetta,</HI> when all was over, ask'd her Si&s;ters for
what they had promi&s;ed her, who thereupon beat
her with their Di&s;taffs, and told her, That it was
for her &s;ake that the King was not &s;orry for them.
Afterwards &s;he went to bed, but being not able to
&s;leep for the Blows and Brui&s;es they had given her,
&s;he heard the Queen &s;ay, &s;he would carry them ano|ther
way farther off, from whence &s;he was a&s;&s;ur'd
they would never return. Upon this &s;he got up &s;oftly,
went into the Hen-hou&s;e, and wrung off the Necks
of two Pullets and a Cockerel, which the Queen
had fed up to regale her&s;elf with; and putting them
into a Basket, &s;et out to go to &s;ee her God-mother
again. She had not gone half a Mile, being in the
dark, and frighten'd out of her Wits, before &s;he
heard the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Hor&s;e whinying and prancing;
who no &s;ooner came to her, but &s;he mounted, and
was carried pre&s;ently to her God-mother's. After
the u&s;ual Compliments, &s;he pre&s;ented her with the
Fowls, and de&s;ired her good Advice, for that the
Queen had &s;worn to carry them to the World's
End. <HI>Merlucha</HI> bid her not grieve her&s;elf, and gave
her a Sack full of A&s;hes to carry before her, to
<PB N="59" REF="68">
&s;prinkle before her as &s;he went along, telling her,
when &s;he return'd, &s;he needed but ob&s;erve her
Foot&s;teps, which would conduct her back again;
and withal charged her not to take her Si&s;ters a|long
with her, a&s;&s;uring her if &s;he did, &s;he never
would &s;ee her more. The Hor&s;e being ready, <HI>Fi|netta</HI>
took her leave, and with it a great quantity
of Diamonds in a Box, which &s;he put into her Poc|ket.
A little before day the Queen call'd the Prin|ce&s;&s;es
again, and told them, that the King was not
very well, and that &s;he dreamt they mu&s;t go all
four to gather &s;ome Herbs for him in a certain
Country, where they were excellent. <HI>Love's-Flower</HI>
and <HI>Fair-Night,</HI> who &s;u&s;pected that their Mother's
main End in this Affair was to lo&s;e them, were
very much afflicted, but were notwith&s;tanding, ob|liged
to go. <HI>Finetta</HI> &s;aid not a word all the time,
but kept behind them, &s;trewing her A&s;hes; and the
Queen being per&s;uaded that they would never be
able to find the way back, for &s;he had carried them
a great di&s;tance off, and ob&s;erving them all a&s;leep
one Evening, took that Opportunity to bid them
good-by. When it was Day, that <HI>Finetta</HI> perceiv'd
her Mother was gone, &s;he awaken'd her Si&s;ters, and
told them, the Queen was gone again, and had left
them to them&s;elves. <HI>Love's-Flower</HI> and <HI>Fair-Night</HI>
cry'd, and tore their Hair, and bear their Brea&s;ts;
when <HI>Finetta,</HI> who was a good-natur'd Girl, pi|tied
them, and told them, tho her God-mother,
when &s;he inform'd her how &s;he &s;hould find the way
back, charged her not to take them along with
her, and &s;aid &s;he never would &s;ee her more if &s;he
did; &startq;Yet, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> I will venture this to pre&s;erve
my Si&s;ters.&endq; Whereupon they both fell upon her
Neck, and ki&s;&s;ed her, and all three returned to|gether.</P>
<P>The King and Queen were very much &s;urprized
to &s;ee the Prince&s;&s;es again, and talk'd about it all
the Night; when <HI>Fine-Ear,</HI> who had not her Name
for nothing, heard them lay a new Plot, which the
<PB N="60" REF="69">
Queen was to put in execution in the Morning,
and thereupon ran and awaken'd her Si&s;ters and
acquainted them with it. Alas! <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> we are
&startq;all lo&s;t, the Queen without di&s;pute will carry us
and leave us in &s;ome De&s;art: for your &s;akes I have
di&s;oblig'd my Godmother, and dare not go to her
as I us'd to do.&endq; This News put them to their
wits-end, and made them &s;ay to one another,
What &s;hall we do? &startq;Oh! <HI>&s;aid</HI> Fair-Night, don't
let us trouble our&s;elves, there are others who
have as much Contrivance as the old <HI>Merlucha,</HI>
we need but to take &s;ome Pea&s;e along with us
and &s;ow them, and we &s;hall ea&s;ily trace our way
back again.&endq; Upon <HI>Love's-Flower's</HI> approving of this
Expedient, they put Pea&s;e in their Pockets; but
for <HI>Fi$e-Ear,</HI> in&s;tead of Pea&s;e, &s;he took her Sack of
fine Clothes and her Box of Jewels: and they were
all three ready again&s;t the Queen call'd. &startq;I have
dream'd to-night, <HI>&s;a$d, &s;he,</HI> that there were three
Princes in a Country I need not name, waiting
to marry you, and I have a great mind to carry
you to &s;ee whether my Dream is true or not.&endq;
The Queen went fir&s;t, and the Prince&s;&s;es follow'd
after, &s;owing the Pea&s;e as they went along, never
di&s;turbing them&s;elves, but being &s;atisfy'd that they
by that means would find their way home; when
one dark Night the Queen left them again and
went home to the King&punc; both weary of &s;o long
a Journey, and glad to have got rid of &s;o great
a Charge.</P>
<P>The three Prince&s;&s;es &s;lept till eleven a-clock
the next day, when <HI>F$netta</HI> di&s;cover'd fir&s;t the
Queen's Ab&s;ence; and tho &s;he was well provided,
could not forbear crying, but however, rely'd more
on the Fairy <HI>Merlucha,</HI> than the Abiltity of her Si&s;ters.
&startq;The Queen is gone, <HI>&s;$id &s;he $word$ her Si&s;ters,</HI> let us
follow her as fa&s;t as we can.&endq; &startq;Hold your
tongue, you Fool, <HI>reply'd</HI> Love's-Flower, we can
find the way when we plea&s;e.&endq; <HI>Finetta</HI> dur&s;t re|tarn
no An&s;wer; but when they wanted to go
<PB N="61" REF="70">
home, they could find no tracings or appearance of
any Pea&s;e; for the Pidgeons, with which that Coun|try
abounded, had eaten them up, which &s;et them
all in Tears. After they had been two Days with|out
eating, <HI>Love's-Flower</HI> ask'd her Si&s;ters, if they had
nothing to eat; whereupon <HI>Finetta</HI> &s;aid, &s;he had
found an Acorn: which they would have had
from her, but &s;he an&s;wer'd, &startq;What &s;ignifies one
Acorn among three of us? let us &s;et it, it may
grow to a large Tree, and be &s;erviceable.&endq; To
which they all con&s;ented, tho there was no likeli|hood
of any Trees in that Country, where there
was nothing to be &s;een but Cabbages and Lettice,
which the Prince&s;&s;es liv'd on; for had they been
nice, they mu&s;t have peri&s;h'd. They had no other
covering when they &s;lept than the azure Skies,
and water'd their Acorn every Night and Morn|ing,
which they perceiv'd grew apace. When it
was got to &s;ome &s;ize, <HI>Love's-Flower</HI> was for climbing
it, but it was too weak to bear her, as was like|wi&s;e
<HI>Fair-N$ght,</HI> but &s;he was too heavy; where|upon
<HI>F$netta</HI> try'd, and when &s;he was up, her Si&s;ters
ask'd her what &s;he &s;aw; &s;he told them nothing.
&startq;Alas, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Love's-Flower, this Oak is not yet tall
enough.&endq; However, they kept watering of it,
and <HI>Finetta</HI> never fail'd to get up into it twice a
day; and one day when &s;he was up, <HI>Fair-Night</HI> &s;aid
to <HI>Love's-F$ower,</HI> &startq;I have found a Sack which our Si&s;ter
has hid from us, what can there be in it?&endq; &startq;Oh,
<HI>&s;aid</HI> Love's-Flower, &s;he told me &s;he had &s;ome old
Laces.&endq; &startq;But I believe &s;he has &s;omething better,
<HI>reply'd</HI> Fair-Night:&endq; and being curious, open'd it,
and found &s;ome old Laces of the King and Queen's,
which &s;erv'd only to cover the fine Clothes and
Jewels. &startq;What a &s;ly Slut is this, <HI>&s;aid &s;h$,</HI> let us
take them away, and put &s;ome Pebbles in their
place: which the other agreeing to, <HI>Finetta</HI> came
down again without ever di&s;covering the trick her
Si&s;ters had play'd her; for &s;he had no occa&s;ion to
dre&s;s in a De&s;art, all her Thoughts being em|ploy'd
on her Oak.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="71">
One Morning when &s;he was up in it, and her
Si&s;ters ask'd her as u&s;ual, what &s;he di&s;cover'd, &s;he
told them, &s;he &s;aw a Hou&s;e &s;o beautiful, that &s;he
could not de&s;cribe it, that the Walls were of E|meralds
and Rubies, and the Roof of Diamonds
&s;et in Gold. &startq;You tell Fibs, <HI>&s;aid they,</HI> it cannot
be &s;o.&endq; &startq;Indeed it is, <HI>an&s;wer'd</HI> Finetta, come
and &s;ee your&s;elves, my Eyes are dazled with
the Splendour.&endq; Whereupon <HI>Love</HI>'s-<HI>Flower</HI> climb'd
up, and when &s;he &s;aw the Ca&s;tle, was amazed;
and for <HI>Fair-N$ght,</HI> who&s;e Curiou&s;ity did not fail to
prompt her to get up in her turn, &s;he &s;eem'd as
much overjoy'd as her Si&s;ters. &startq;We mu&s;t, without
di&s;pute, &s;aid they, go to this Palace; who knows
but we may meet with fine Princes that will think
them&s;elves happy to marry us?&endq; In this manner of
Di&s;cour&s;e they pa&s;s'd away the whole Night, when
<HI>Love's-Flower</HI> perceiving <HI>Finetta</HI> a&s;leep, &s;aid to <HI>Fair-Night,</HI>
&startq;Let us dre&s;s our&s;elves in the Clothes <HI>Finetta</HI>
has brought along with her.&endq; &startq;The Thought's
very good, <HI>reply'd</HI> Fair-Night.&endq; Whereupon they
got up and dre&s;s'd them&s;elves, and made them&s;elves
as fine as Gold, and Silver, and Jewels could do.</P>
<P><HI>Finetta,</HI> who knew not what her Si&s;ters had
done, open'd her Sack with a de&s;ign to dre&s;s her|&s;elf;
but how great was her Surprize and Afflic|tion,
when &s;he found nothing but Flints and Stones?
and perceiving at that very juncture her two Si&s;ters
as bright as the Sun in her Clothes, &s;he cry'd, and
complain'd of their Treachery; who only laugh'd
at her. &startq;How can you, <HI>&s;aid &s;he to them,</HI> carry me
along with you to the Ca&s;tle, without letting me
be dre&s;s'd as well as your&s;elves?&endq; &startq;We have but
Clothes enough for our&s;elves <HI>reply'd</HI> Love's-Flower,
and if thou importune&s;t us thus, thou &s;halt feel
our Blows.&endq; &startq;But <HI>continu'd the other,</HI> they are my
own, my God-mother gave them to me, and you
have nothing to do with them.&endq; &startq;If you teaze
us any longer, <HI>&s;aid they,</HI> we'll kill you and bury
you, and no-body &s;hall know what is become of
<PB N="63" REF="72">
you.&endq; Which &s;truck &s;uch a awe upon poor <HI>Finetta,</HI>
that &s;he dur&s;t not provoke them, but follow'd them
like their Servant-Maid at a di&s;tance. The nearer
they came to the Hou&s;e, the more wonderful it ap|pear'd.
&startq;I cannot but think, <HI>&s;aid they one to ano|ther,</HI>
how we &s;hall be diverted and entertain'd;
we &s;hall eat at the King's Table, but for <HI>Finetta,</HI>
&s;he &s;hall wa&s;h the Di&s;hes in the Kitchen: and if
we are ask'd who &s;he is, let us not make the lea&s;t
mention of her as our Si&s;ter, but &s;ay, &s;he is a poor
Herds-Man's Daughter.&endq; Which ca&s;t <HI>Finetta</HI> into
De&s;pair, &s;he being a Girl endow'd with Wit and
Beauty. When they arriv'd at the Gates of the
Ca&s;tle, they knock'd very hard, and were let in by
a frightful old Woman: She was fifteen foot high
and thirty about, had but one Eye, and that plac'd
in the mid&s;t of her Forehead like a <HI>Cyclops,</HI> and as
large as five others; her No&s;e was flat, her Skin
black, and her Mouth &s;o large that it was very
frightful. &startq;Oh! unfortunate Creatures, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI>
what brought you hither? Do you know that this
is a Giant's Ca&s;tle, who would eat you all up for
his Breakfa&s;t? But it is well he is not at home,
I am better than he, I will eat but one of you
at a time, and you will have the Comfort of liv|ing
two or three days longer.&endq; When they heard
the Giante&s;s &s;peak thus, they ran away as fa&s;t as
they could, thinking to &s;ave them&s;elves, but &s;he
&s;trid as far at one &s;tep as they at five, and &s;oon
caught them again; and taking one by the Hair of
the Head, and the others by the Arms and Necks,
threw them all together into a Cave, where there
was nought but Toads, Snakes, and the Bones of
devour'd Per&s;ons. And as &s;he was then for eating
<HI>Finetta,</HI> and was only gone for &s;ome Oil and Vine|gar,
the Giant came; but thinking to keep them
for her&s;elf, as a nice Bit, &s;he put them under a
great Tub, where they had no light but through a

The Giant, who was &s;ix times as big as his Wife,
when he &s;poke, made the Hou&s;e &s;hake again, and
when he cough'd, $word$ &s;eem'd like Thunder; he had
but one large Eye, and his Hair was like Bri&s;tles;
he lean'd on a piece of Timber, which he u&s;ed for
a Cane, and held a Basket in his Hand, out of
which he took fifteen little Children he had taken
away from their Parents, and &s;wallow'd them like
poach'd Eggs. When the three Prince&s;&s;es beheld
this, they &s;hudder'd, but dur&s;t not cry, for fear
they &s;hould be heard. The Giant &s;aid to his Wife,
&startq;I &s;mell &s;ome fre&s;h Fle&s;h, give it me.&endq; &startq;You al|ways
fancy, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> that you &s;mell fre&s;h Meat,
'tis nothing but &s;ome Sheep that are going by.&endq;
&startq;Oh! <HI>&s;aid the Giant,</HI> I am not to be deceived thus;
I am &s;ure I &s;mell fre&s;h Fle&s;h, and will look for
it.&endq; &startq;Ay do,&endq; <HI>reply'd &s;he:</HI> &startq;And if I find any,
<HI>&s;aid he,</HI> that you have concealed from me, I'll cut
off your Head.&endq; Frighted at this Menace, <HI>&s;he &s;aid
to him,</HI> &startq;Be not angry, my Dear, and I will tell you
the truth, I have got three young Girls, that
came here to-day, but 'tis pity to eat them, for
they know how to do every thing, and, as I am
old, will be very &s;erviceable to me. You know
our Hou&s;e is very much our of order, our Bread
is not well baked, nor our Beer well brewed,
and I appear not &s;o hand&s;ome &s;ince I have &s;laved
my&s;elf with working; they &s;hall be our Servants,
therefore don't eat them now, but if you have
a great de&s;ire to them any other time, you &s;hall
have them.&endq; The Giant, with great reluctancy,
promi&s;ed her not to eat them all three, but pre&s;s'd
hard for two, which &s;he oppo&s;ing, he then de&s;ir'd
one of them; which &s;he not acq$ie&s;cing with, af|ter
great Di&s;putes, he promi&s;ed her not to eat
them: for &s;he de&s;ign'd, when he was gone abroad,
to fea&s;t her&s;elf with them, and to pretend they had
made their E&s;cape.</P>
<P>The Giant order'd his Wife to bring them to him;
at which they, poor Creatures, were ready to die
<PB N="65" REF="74">
with fear, but the Giante&s;s encouraged them. When
he &s;aw them, he ask'd them what they could do?
They an&s;wer'd, that they knew how to clean a
Hou&s;e, and &s;ew, and &s;pin, and made &s;uch Ragouts,
that all that ta&s;ted of them generally lick'd their
Plates clean; and that for making of Bread, Cakes,
and Patty-pans, they were famous. &startq;Well, well,
<HI>&s;aid the Giant, who loved a dainty Bit,</HI> make good
your words; but, <HI>&s;aid he to</HI> Finetta, how do you
know when the Oven is hot enough?&endq; &startq;I lay
&s;ome Butter on it, Sir, <HI>reply'd &s;he,</HI> and then ta&s;te
it with my Tongue.&endq; Thereupon he order'd her
to heat the Oven; and the Prince&s;s made a terri|ble
Fire, for, you mu&s;t know, the Giant's Oven was
as large as a Stable, and he and his Wife devour'd
as much Bread as an Army; and the Giant, who
overlooked them, eat an hundred Cakes and Piggins
of Milk. <HI>Love's-F$$wer</HI> and <HI>Fair-N$ght</HI> prepared the
Pa&s;te; the Giant &s;aid, the Oven was hot enough:
<HI>Finetta</HI> told him, &s;he would &s;ee whether 'twas &s;o,
and throwing &s;ome Pounds of Butter into the O|ven's
Mouth, told him it mu&s;t be ta&s;ted with the
Tongue, but that &s;he was too little to do it. &startq;Oh!
<HI>&s;aid he,</HI> I am big enough:&endq; and thereupon he thru&s;t
him&s;elf &s;o far in, that he could not get back again,
but was burnt to A&s;hes.</P>
<P>When the Giant's Wife came to the Oven, &s;he
was &s;urprized to find &s;uch an heap of A&s;hes, as pro|ceeded
from her burnt Husband. <HI>Love's-Flower</HI> and
<HI>Fair-N$ght,</HI> who &s;aw her very much grieved, did
what they could to comfort her; but at the &s;ame
time were afraid her Sorrow would be too &s;oon o|ver,
and her Appetite come upon her. &startq;Madam, <HI>&s;aid
they,</HI> have Courage, &s;ome King or great Prince
will think them&s;elves happy to marry you:&endq; which
made her laugh, and &s;hew her long Teeth, that
were as large as a Finger. When they &s;aw her in
a good humour, <HI>Finetta</HI> &s;aid to her, &startq;If you will
throw off tho&s;e Bear-Skins, with which you now
clothe your&s;elf, we will dre&s;s you a-la-mode, and
<PB N="66" REF="75">
you &s;hall appear as bright as any Star. &startq;Let me
&s;ee, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> what you would be at; but a&s;&s;ure
your&s;elf, if any Ladies look better than me, I
will make minc'd Meat of you.&endq; Whereupon the
three Prince&s;&s;es pull'd off her Cap, and comb'd and
frizled her Hair; and while the two Si&s;ters were
amu&s;ing her after that manner, <HI>Finetta</HI> with an
Hatchet &s;ever'd her Head from her Body at one
Blow.</P>
<P>Never was Joy equal to theirs, they ran up to
the top of the Hou&s;e to ring the golden Bells, went
into all the Chambers of Pearls and Diamonds, the
Furniture of which was &s;o rich, that it was an Ex|ta&s;y
of Plea&s;ure to behold it; they laugh'd and &s;ung
all that day long, and almo&s;t glutted them&s;elves
with Sweetmeats and other Dainties. <HI>Love's-Flower</HI>
and <HI>Fair-Night</HI> laid in Beds of Brocade and Velvet,
and &s;aid one to another, &startq;Our Father never was
&s;o rich in all his Pro&s;perity, but yet we want Hu&s;|bands,
and may be a&s;&s;ured no body will ever
come here, &s;ince this Hou&s;e pa&s;&s;es for a Place of
De&s;truction; &s;ince the Giant's and his Wife's
Deaths are unknown, therefore we mu&s;t go to
the next Village to &s;hew our&s;elves in our Finery,
and we &s;hall not be long before we find Per&s;ons
enough who will be glad to marry Prince&s;&s;es.&endq;</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they were dre&s;s'd, they told <HI>Finetta</HI>
they were going a walking, and that &s;he mu&s;t &s;tay
there to take care of the Hou&s;e, and have every
thing in order again&s;t they return'd, or el&s;e they
&s;hould make her feel their Blows. When they
were gone, <HI>Finetta,</HI> who was forced to &s;cour and
wa&s;h, was &s;o overpower'd with Grief, that &s;he bur&s;t
out a crying. &startq;How unhappy was I, <HI>&s;aid &s;he to
her&s;elf,</HI> to di&s;obey my God-mother, all Misfortunes
have &s;ince attended me; my Si&s;ters have robbed
me of my fine Clothes, and dre&s;s'd them&s;elves in
them. Had it not been for me, the Giant and his
Wife had been yet alive; and what am I the bet|ter
for their Deaths? I &s;hould have been as well
<PB N="67" REF="76">
plea&s;ed to have been devoured by them, as to live
as I do now.&endq; When &s;he had &s;aid all this, &s;he cry'd
&s;o much, that her Eyes were almo&s;t &s;woln out of
her Head; and when her Si&s;ters came home, &s;he
had the mortification to &s;ee them bring with them
Oranges, and Sweetmeats, and fine Fruits, and to
hear them tell what Re&s;pect they had paid by a
King's Son at a Ball they had been at; and withal
to be bid to come and undre&s;s them, and lay up
their Clothes: which &s;he dur&s;t not refu&s;e, for if
ever &s;he complain'd, they flew upon her, and beat
her till they left her for dead.</P>
<P>The next day they went again, and came back
as before, and lived in that manner &s;ome time;
when one night, as <HI>Finetta</HI> was &s;itting over an hand|ful
of Fire, not knowing what to do with her|&s;elf,
raking among the Cinders, &s;he found an old
ru&s;ty, canker'd, little Key; and after having taken a
great deal of pains to &s;cour it, found it to be Gold:
and thinking it might open &s;ome Lock in the Hou&s;e,
try'd them all, and it belong'd to a fine Box, which
&s;he open'd, wherein there were rich Clothes, Dia|monds,
Laces, fine Linen, Ribbons, and Things of
great Value. Never mentioning a word of this good
Fortune, &s;he waited impatiently for her Si&s;ters go|ing
again the next day, and then as &s;oon as &s;he
&s;aw them out of doors, dre&s;s'd her&s;elf &s;o fine, that
&s;he appear'd as glorious as the Sun, and went to
the &s;ame Ball; and tho &s;he had no Mask on, yet
her Clothes had made &s;o great an Alteration in her
for the better, that they did not know her. When
&s;he appear'd in that A&s;&s;embly, there was heard a
Murmuring of Voices, &s;ome out of Admiration, and
others of Jealou&s;y; and when &s;he danced, &s;he ex|celled
as much therein as in her Beauty.</P>
<P><HI>Love's-Flower</HI> and <HI>Fair-Night,</HI> who had made there
&s;trange havock among the Hearts, &s;eeing the fa|vourable
Reception this Stranger met with, were
ready to bur&s;t with Jealou&s;y; but <HI>Finetta,</HI> who be|haved
her&s;elf extraordinary well, &s;eem'd by her
<PB N="68" REF="77">
Air as if &s;he was made to command. <HI>Love's-Flower</HI>
and <HI>Fair-Night,</HI> who had been u&s;ed to &s;ee their Si|&s;ter
&s;mutty and grimy, retain'd &s;o &s;mall an Idea of
her Face, that they knew her not, but paid as
much re&s;pect to her as the re&s;t; and &s;he, as &s;oon as
the Ball was over, ran home as fa&s;t as &s;he could,
and put on her dirty Rags again. When her Si&s;ters
came home, they told her they had &s;een a charm|ing
young Prince&s;s, who&s;e Skin was as white as
Snow, the Colour in her Cheeks as fre&s;h as a Ro&s;e,
her Teeth as even and white as Ivory, and for her
Lips, they look'd like Coral, and that her Clothes
were all over Gold and Diamonds. This Sport con|tinued
&s;ome time, and <HI>Finetta</HI> every Ball appeared
in a different Dre&s;s, for the Che&s;t was inexhau&s;tible,
and the Clothes were all &s;o fa&s;hionable, that the
Ladies follow'd that Mode.</P>
<P>One night that <HI>Finetta</HI> had danced very much,
and had &s;tayed longer than ordinary, and was wil|ling
to get home &s;oon enough, that &s;he might not
be di&s;cover'd by her Si&s;ters, &s;he made &s;o much
ha&s;te, that &s;he lo&s;t her Slipper, which was of red
Velvet braided with Pearls, and was found the next
day by the Prince <HI>Chery,</HI> the King's elde&s;t Son, as
he was hunting; who took it up, and admired it &s;o
much for its Smallne&s;s, that he ki&s;s'd it, and carried it
home with him, and from that day grew &s;o melan|choly
and re&s;erved, that he never would &s;peak, lo&s;t
his Stomach, fell away and look'd &s;o ill, that the
King and Queen, who loved him to di&s;traction,
&s;ent for all the Remedies and A&s;&s;i&s;tance they could
get; but all to no purpo&s;e, for the Phy&s;icians, after
they had con&s;ulted together, and made their Ob&s;er|vations
for two or three days together, concluded
that he was in love, and would die, unle&s;s he had
&s;ome Relief.</P>
<P>The Queen, who doated on him, cry'd day and
night over him, but could make no di&s;covery who
the beloved Per&s;on was; &s;he brought all the mo&s;t
beautiful Ladies of the Court into his Chamber,
<PB N="69" REF="78">
but he would not &s;o much as look at them. At
la&s;t the Queen &s;aid to him one day, &startq;My dear Child,
you overwhelm us with Grief, we know you are
in love, wherefore then &s;hould you hide it from
us? tell us who the lovely Per&s;on is, and &s;hould
&s;he prove a Shepherde&s;s, we will not oppo&s;e your
De&s;ires.&endq; Hereupon the Prince, grown more bold
by the Queen's Promi&s;es, pull'd the Slipper from
under his Bol&s;ter; &startq;This, Madam, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> is the
Cau&s;e of my Illne&s;s, I found this pretty little Slip|per
as I was one day a hunting, and am re&s;olved
never to marry any but the Per&s;on that can
draw it on.&endq; &startq;Alas! Child, <HI>&s;aid the Queen,</HI> grieve
not, we &s;hall &s;oon find her out.&endq; And then &s;he
left him, and told the King; who was very much
&s;urprized at the Strangene&s;s of his Pa&s;&s;ion, and or|der'd
to be proclaim'd by Sound of Trumpet, That
all Women &s;hould come and try on the Slipper, and
that the Per&s;on whom it fitted &s;hould be married
to the Prince. Upon this all the fine Ladies of the
Court wa&s;h'd and pared their Feet, and made choice
of the thinne&s;t Stockings, that they might put on
the Slipper; but all to no purpo&s;e, &s;ince none of
them could get it on: which was no &s;mall Affliction
to the Prince. <HI>Love's-Flower</HI> and <HI>Fair-Night</HI> upon this
dre&s;s'd them&s;elves &s;o fine one day, that <HI>Finetta</HI> was
amazed, and ask'd them, where they were going?
who told her, to Court, to try on the Slipper that
the King's Son had found, and that whoever &s;uc|ceeded,
was to marry him: whereupon <HI>Finetta</HI> ask'd,
if &s;he might not go, which made them laugh at
her, and tell her, they wonder'd how &s;uch a dirty
Girl as &s;he could have any &s;uch Thoughts, bidding
her water the Garden, for &s;he was fit for nothing
el&s;e.</P>
<P>When they were gone, <HI>Finetta</HI> had a great
mind to try her Fortune, having a &s;trong fancy of
her Succe&s;s, but was &s;omewhat at a lo&s;s, becau&s;e
&s;he knew not the way; for the Ball &s;he was at
before, was not kept at Court. However, &s;he dre&s;|&s;ed
<PB N="70" REF="79">
her&s;elf very magnificent, her Gown was of
blue Sattin, cover'd over with Stars of Diamonds;
a full Moon was placed in the middle of her Back,
and a Sun upon her Head, which gave &s;uch a Lu|&s;tre,
as dazled the Eyes of the Spectators. When
&s;he open'd the Door to go out, &s;he was very much
&s;urprized to find <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Hor&s;e there; &s;he ca|re&s;s'd
him, and was overjoy'd to &s;ee him, and
mounting on him, appear'd a thou&s;and times more
beautiful than <HI>Hele$.</HI> The Hor&s;e went prancing a|long,
and by the Noi&s;e he made with champing of
his Bits, made <HI>Love's-Flower</HI> and her Si&s;ter look be|hind
to &s;ee who was coming after them; but how
great was their A&s;toni&s;hment, when they &s;aw it
was <HI>Finetta!</HI> &startq;I prote&s;t, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Love's-Flower <HI>to</HI> Fair-Night,
'tis <HI>Finetta;</HI>&endq; and the other was about mak|ing
&s;ome Reply, when the Hor&s;e pa&s;&s;ing by, da&s;h'd
them all over with Dirt: whereupon <HI>Finetta</HI> told them,
that &s;he de&s;pi&s;ed them as they de&s;erved, and &s;o put
forward. &startq;Certainly, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Fair-Night, we dream;
who could have furni&s;hed her with this Hor&s;e and
fine Clothes? 'tis a Miracle to me: &s;he will without
di&s;pute have the good-fortune to get on the Slipper,
therefore 'tis in vain for us to go any further.&endq;</P>
<P>While they were in the utmo&s;t Rage and De&s;pair,
<HI>Finetta</HI> arrived at the Palace, where &s;he being ta|ken
for a Queen, the Guards were under Arms,
with Drums beating and Trumpets &s;ounding. She
went into the Prince's Chamber, who no &s;ooner
&s;et his Eyes on her, but he was charm'd, and wi&s;h'd
her Foot &s;mall enough to put on the Slipper; which
&s;he not only did do, but al&s;o produced the Fellow
to it. Upon which all Per&s;ons pre&s;ent cry'd, <HI>Long
live the Prince&s;s;</HI> and the Prince aro&s;e from off his
Bed, came and ki&s;&s;ed her Hand, and declared to
her his Pa&s;&s;ion. As &s;oon as the King and Queen
heard of it, they came overjoy'd; the Queen flung
her Arms about her Neck, and embraced her, and
called her Daughter. The King and Queen made
her great Pre&s;ents, the Cannons were fired, and
<PB N="71" REF="80">
there were the mo&s;t publick Demon&s;trations of
Joy po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The Prince de&s;ired &s;he would con&s;ent to his
Happine&s;s, and that they might be married; which
&s;he refu&s;ed till &s;he had told them her Adventures,
which &s;he did in few words. Their Joy was aug|mented
&s;o much the more, when they knew her to
be a Prince&s;s by Birth; and upon her acquainting
them with the Names of her Father and Mother,
inform'd her that they had deprived them of their
Kingdoms. As &s;oon as &s;he knew that, &s;he &s;wore
never to give her Hand to the Prince, unle&s;s they
were re&s;tored again to their Dominions, which the
King her Father-in-law made no &s;cruple to grant.
In the mean time <HI>Love's-Flower</HI> and <HI>Fair-Night</HI> ar|rived,
and the fir&s;t News they heard, was, that
their Si&s;ter had put on the Slipper, and were &s;o
much confu&s;ed, that they knew not what to &s;ay
or do, but at la&s;t were for going back again; when
&s;he hearing that they were there, &s;ent for them,
and in&s;tead of u&s;ing them as they de&s;erved, met
them, and embraced them, and afterwards pre|&s;ented
them to the Queen, acquainting her that
they were her Si&s;ters, for whom &s;he de&s;ired &s;he
would have &s;ome re&s;pect. They were &s;o much &s;ur|prized
at their Si&s;ter's Goodne&s;s, that they &s;tood
&s;peechle&s;s; but upon her telling them, that the
Prince her Spou&s;e would re&s;tore the King their Fa|ther,
and &s;end them into their own Country, they
fell on their Knees before her, and wept for Joy.</P>
<P>The Nuptials were celebrated with all the Pomp
imaginable; <HI>Finetta</HI> writ a Letter to her God-mo|ther,
which &s;he &s;ent with great Pre&s;ents by the
<HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Hor&s;e, de&s;iring her to find out the King and
Queen her Father and Mother, and let them know
her Good-fortune, and that they might return to
their own Kingdoms: which Commi&s;&s;ion the Fairy
acquitted her&s;elf of, and the King and Queen were
re&s;tored to their Dominions. <HI>Love's-Flower</HI> and <HI>Fair-Night</HI>
lived as great and happy as they could de&s;ire,
<PB N="72" REF="81">
and became afterwards great Queens as well as
their Si&s;ter.</P>

<HEAD>The Continuation of the Story of
Don Gabriel.</HEAD>
<P>WE may imagine that the Count and <HI>Melan|thia</HI>
applauded this Story out of Complai|&s;ance;
which plea&s;ed <HI>Juana</HI> &s;o much, that &s;he &s;aid,
in her opinion it was as good as Don <HI>Gabriel</HI>'s.
&startq;Oh! Madam, <HI>&s;aid the Count,</HI> nothing comes up to
yours;&endq; and had enlarged much more in its prai&s;e,
had not they been inform'd that the Archbi&s;hop of
<HI>Compo&s;iella</HI> was arrived. Whereupon &s;he made all
the ha&s;te &s;he could to go and receive him, and <HI>Me|lanthia</HI>
was following her, had not the Count de|tain'd
her: &startq;Madam, you will think me very
bold, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> to &s;tay you, to tell you the Violence
of my Pa&s;&s;ion; but I love you&mdash;.&endq; There he
&s;top'd, when re&s;uming the Di&s;cour&s;e again, he &s;aid,
&startq;You blu&s;h at &s;o barefaced a Declaration, but
judge not my Heart by my Fortune, I am &s;ure it
will perform Miracles in my favour, if you are
but kind.&endq; &startq;Leave off your &s;illy Di&s;cour&s;e, <HI>Don</HI>
E&s;tevus, <HI>&s;aid &s;he, with an Ai$$of Di&s;dain;</HI> the be&s;t
you can expect from your Temerity, is, that I
hold my tongue, and look on you for the future
as mad.&endq; The Count was thunder-&s;truck, and
was about to reply, that if Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> had been the
Per&s;on, &s;he had not an&s;wer'd him &s;o &s;harply; but
over-ruling his Jealou&s;y, he let her go without any
more to do, and walk'd in &s;ome di&s;order about the
Gallery, where he was met by Don <HI>Gabriel,</HI> who
from his Melancholy pre&s;aged &s;ome ill News, and
thereupon ask'd him what was their Fate; &startq;I know
not what yours is, <HI>reply'd the Count,</HI> but for my
<PB N="73" REF="82">
own, I have no rea&s;on to be over-well plea&s;ed with
it; <HI>Melanthia</HI> treats me like a mi&s;erable Wretch,
and fortifies her&s;elf again&s;t the Ob&s;curity of my
Birth: but in &s;hort you are the greate&s;t Ob&s;tacle.&endq;
&startq;Alas! <HI>&s;aid Don</HI> Gabriel, how much more &s;ucce&s;sful
am I? <HI>I&s;idora</HI> de&s;pi&s;es me as much, and I have
not yet dared to reveal my Pa&s;&s;ion, left I &s;hould
add to her Di&s;plea&s;ure.&endq; &startq;You are le&s;s to be pi|tied
than me, <HI>continued the Count; I&s;idora</HI> is alone
the Object of your Cares, but for my part, I mu&s;t
be ridiculou&s;ly complai&s;ant to an old Woman, on
whom I am forced to be&s;tow my more precious
Moments, and who every now and then lets me
know that I am not di&s;plea&s;ing to her, and is
per&s;uaded that I adore her: What can be more
extravagant?&endq;</P>
<P>He went on, talking after this manner, without
receiving any Reply from Don <HI>Gabriel;</HI> which made
him ask him, What was the matter that he was in
&s;o deep a Study? &startq;I am making &s;ome Ver&s;es, <HI>re|ply'd
he,</HI> upon <HI>I&s;idora</HI>'s Love, and you &s;hall give me
your opinion when I have fini&s;hed them.&endq; &startq;Oh!
<HI>&s;aid the Count</HI> I would not advi&s;e you to tru&s;t to
my Judgment, for at this time I have no Freedom
of Thought.&endq;</P>
<P>Just as they were going out of the Gallery, they
heard Donna <HI>Juana</HI>'s Woman calling them, who
came for them to &s;ing before the Archbi&s;hop; but
they knew them&s;elves too well, to venture to ap|pear
before him, and therefore excu&s;ed them&s;elves
upon account of a Rheum and a Pain in their
Heads: and for fear they &s;hould be pre&s;s'd further,
went into the Chamber in the Park, that looked into
the Wood, which put a thou&s;and Thoughts into
their Heads; one complain'd of their coming to
&s;eek after Trouble and Cares, and the other griev|ed
to find &s;o little Return from an Heart capable
of making his Life happy: when looking towards
the Wood, they both agreed that they had been
happy if they had &s;tay'd there, &s;ince they were &s;o

her Si&s;ter to &s;top before they were at the Arbour,

&s;oon as her Vi&s;itor was got into his Coach, &s;he
&s;earch'd all the Walks in the Park; and being drawn
$hither by Don <HI>Gabriel</HI>'s Voice, and hearing him
mention <HI>I&s;idora</HI> in the fir&s;t Stanza, and old Age af|terward,
made no di&s;pute but that it was aim'd
at her. &startq;Is it thus, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> Don <HI>Gabriel,</HI> you re|pay
my Kindne&s;&s;es, and the Entertainment I have

very ludicrous manner.&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>Our two Lovers Surprize at the&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions
was not to be expre&s;s'd, who apprehended nothing
&s;o much as the Con&s;equences of &s;o violent a Pa&s;|&s;ion;
then it was that they were &s;en&s;ible of what
they might lo&s;e, if &s;he &s;hould oblige them to go.
The Count was endeavouring to excu&s;e Don <HI>Ga|briel,</HI>
when <HI>I&s;idora</HI> and <HI>Melanthia,</HI> urged on by a fear
they could not account for, came and interpo&s;ed:
&startq;What, Madam, <HI>&s;aid they,</HI> don't you remember we
made this Song in your Chamber to divert you,

three Ver&s;es? We learnt them Don <HI>Gabriel,</HI> and if

<P>As the&s;e two Ladies were u&s;ed to take great plea|&s;ure
in making Songs, Donna <HI>Juana</HI> was &s;oon per|&s;uaded
to believe them, and was very glad to find
her&s;elf mi&s;taken in her Su&s;picions; and told Don

<HI>Gabriel,</HI> &s;he was &s;orry for the Expre&s;&s;ions &s;he u&s;e$

<HI>Juana</HI> had &s;u&s;pected me guilty of &s;o much Ingra|titude.&endq;

her: Which &s;oft Language gain'd him a gracious
Look.</P>
<P>When they were retired, and had more liberty
of Di&s;cour&s;e, the Count embracing his Cou&s;in, told
him, that the old Lady had put him into a terrible

what I have done: I don't know whether <HI>I&s;idora</HI>
may &s;hew more favour to Poets than other Folks,
but I'll a&s;&s;ure you, &s;he look'd more kindly upon
me than ever.&endq; &startq;Oh! was <HI>Melanthia</HI> of the &s;ame

night and day; but her Heart is inflexible.&endq; How|ever,
the next day, as he was &s;inging as tender pa&s;|&s;ionate

in&s;tead of putting down what &s;he de&s;ired,
writ the following Lines:

me now for the Trick I &s;erved you; but if you will
lend me your Book again, I will write what you

her; but the Per&s;on that &s;poke was not agreeable
enough to her to de&s;erve an An&s;wer. Thus the&s;e
four Per&s;ons, who were capable of compleating
each other's Felicity, were tormented by the Ca|price
of their Stars.</P>

was very much &s;urprized at &s;o extravagant a Pro|po&s;al,

as po&s;&s;ible. &startq;I cannot, Madam, <HI>reply'd he,</HI> &s;hew too

<P>&startq;A young rich Widow of Quality and Di&s;tinction
having taken a liking to me, made me a Propo&s;i|tion
of Marriage, which I accepted of with Joy,
and communicated to my Father, who was very
well plea&s;ed at it. We had not been married a|bove
eight days at a Country-Seat &s;he had near
<HI>Ant$$r$,</HI> before her fir&s;t Husband arrived, who
was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been dead about ten Years.
My Wife, or, to &s;peak more properly, his, pretend|ed
not to know him: However, this Affair made
&s;o great a noi&s;e, and my Vexation was &s;o great,
that I left the Management of that Bu&s;ine&s;s to my
Father, and &s;et out with my Brother for <HI>St. Jacques.</HI>
Now what I ask of you, Madam, is, that we may

<P>As it was then late, and Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> and the

the Count heard the Chamber-door open'd very &s;oft|ly,

when he &s;aw a Man and a Woman come in! which

they thought 'twas Donna <HI>Juana,</HI> who was
coming to make the Count a Vi&s;it, but could not
think what could make her bring a Man along with
her. Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> remember'd that <HI>I&s;idora</HI> was grown
more obliging to him, and flatter'd him&s;elf that &s;he
might have repented of her Indifference, and had a

into her Chamber; but finding her a&s;leep, retir'd to
his Aunt <HI>Juana</HI>'s, who was very much &s;urprized to
&s;ee him. After &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e, he told her, that
he had courted <HI>Lucilla</HI> with the Con&s;ent of her
Friends for two Years, when &s;he had but a &s;mall
Fortune; that the Match was concluded, and he
loved her for her Virtue and good Qualities: but
upon the Death of her Brother, who was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ina|ted,
and &s;he being left one of the be&s;t Fortunes in
<HI>Andalu&s;ia,</HI> her Grandfather had removed her from
<HI>cad$z</HI> to <HI>Sevil,</HI> and kept her clo&s;e up in his Hou&s;e,
with a de&s;ign to marry her to a Son of a Friend of
his; that he not being able to brook &s;o great an
Affront, and lo&s;e his Mi&s;tre&s;s, having &s;ome corre|&s;pondence

&s;teal her away; and withal de&s;ired his Aunt to re|ceive
her kindly, and pay her all imaginable Re|&s;pect.</P>
<P>Donna <HI>Juana,</HI> who was very nice and cautious in

&s;hould bring her in as a Party concern'd if
&s;he receiv'd her; but recollecting that the Hou&s;e
was not hers, and &s;o &s;he was not an&s;werable for
what was done in it, and that &s;he &s;hould not know
how to keep her Mu&s;icians in the Hou&s;e, but Don
<HI>Lewis</HI> would blame her Conduct, and not &s;u&s;pect|ing

very dangerous, that I am in &s;ome fear of the Re|lations
of <HI>Lucilla.</HI> But I'll tell you one way; I
have an Hou&s;e hard by <HI>Sevil,</HI> your Si&s;ters and I
will go and live there, and moderate Matters while

Don <HI>Lewis</HI> approved his Aunt's Scheme, compre|hending
it to be a means to engage <HI>Lucilla</HI> not to
defer his Happine&s;s; for if &s;he was not his Wife,
&s;he could &s;tay alone with him, whereas if &s;he lived
with Donna <HI>Juana,</HI> &s;he might remain there till &s;he
heard what Re&s;olution her Friends would come to:
therefore he declared to his Aunt, that he liked
her Contrivance very well, and then went to his
Si&s;ters, who were ju&s;t up, and were overjoy'd to
&s;ee him. After common Civilities, and reciprocal
Tokens of Friend&s;hip, Don <HI>Lewis</HI> acquainted them
with all his Proceedings, and his running away
with Donna <HI>Lucilla;</HI> at which they &s;hew'd &s;ome
Unea&s;ine&s;s, dreading, as well as their Aunt, the fa|tal
Con&s;equences which generally attend tho&s;e Af|fairs.
When he told them, that he could not ex|pect
that Death would be &s;o kind as to take away
his greate&s;t Enemy, who was not old, tho <HI>Lucilla</HI>'s
Grandfather; they told him, that as &s;oon as they
were dre&s;s'd, they would pay their Re&s;pects to her,
and were per&s;uaded they &s;hould live very happy to|gether:
which he told them was not to be, for
that Donna <HI>Juana</HI> was going directly into <HI>Andalu&s;ia,</HI>
for fear &s;he &s;hould be brought into the Scrape.
&startq;But, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> my Aunt told me of two Pilgrims,
who being wounded in their way to <HI>St. Jacques,</HI>
&s;he had taken into the Hou&s;e, and that they
taught to play upon Mu&s;ick; were they not &s;o
young and hand&s;ome, I &s;hould approve of their
being here: but if there is a nece&s;&s;ity for you to

Strangers, that are not accu&s;tomed to the

Don <HI>Gabriel Ponce,</HI> of <HI>Leon,</HI> is de&s;cended from the
mo&s;t illu&s;trious Family in <HI>Europe;</HI> Don <HI>Manuel
Ponce,</HI> of <HI>Leon,</HI> Duke of <HI>Arcos,</HI> was his Grandfa|ther,

of the Queen of <HI>Granada,</HI> when the King

death. And for Don <HI>E&s;tevus,</HI> the Count <HI>d'Aguilar,</HI>

in Birth to the greate&s;t Lords in <HI>Andalu&s;ia,</HI>

and is de&s;cended from Don <HI>Alon&s;o d'Aguilar,</HI> who
fought for the &s;ame Queen of <HI>Granada.</HI> In &s;hort,
they are both Gentlemen of E&s;tates and Worth,

Donna <HI>Juana.</HI>&endq; &startq;Now, Brother, I know, <HI>cry'd</HI> I&s;i|dora,
you are in earne&s;t; 'tis an hard thing for

under their Pilgrims $abit.&endq; &startq;But, dear Bro|ther,
<HI>interrupted</HI> Melanthia, &s;ince there is &s;o much

him.&endq; &startq;Yes, Si&s;ter, <HI>reply'd he,</HI> he has put
that confidence in me, and declares for <HI>I&s;idora,</HI> and

<P>At the&s;e words they both turn'd pale, their
Choice was already fix'd, and each thought her
Heart uncapable of altering its Sentiments; and
Don <HI>Lewis</HI> examining further into the matter, with|out
di&s;covering what he knew before, le&s;t they
&s;hould complain of their Lovers Indi&s;cretion, &s;aid

I had hope that Gratitude, and the Vanity of en|gaging
my Heart might have had &s;ome influence

<P><HI>I&s;idora,</HI> without returning any An&s;wer for a long

Melanthia, their Metamorpho&s;is from Mu|&s;icians
may have &s;ome effect on their Hearts; for
as we have hitherto taken care to conceal the
Sentiments of ours from them, I cannot but think,
that when they are inform'd of them, they will
be moved.&endq; &startq;Alas! you are very much mi&s;taken,
<HI>continued</HI> I&s;idora, our Eyes have &s;poke too plain,

<P><HI>Melanthia</HI> was going to make &s;ome Reply, when
a Servant came to bid them dre&s;s pre&s;ently, for
that Donna <HI>Juana</HI> intended to take them with her,
to pay a Vi&s;it to <HI>Lucilla.</HI> They plaited their Hair
in a negligent manner, and to add to their natural
Charms, mix'd &s;ome Flowers among&s;t it, which
made them look as beautiful as <HI>Flora</HI> her&s;elf. Their
Gowns were a thin white Crape, which is the
Mourning of Ladies of Fa&s;hion in <HI>Spain;</HI> which be|ing
made clo&s;e to their Stays, their Shapes appear'd
very delicate, and, in &s;hort, their whole Per&s;ons
extraordinary beautiful; only the Tears they had let
fall, had deprived their Eyes &s;omewhat of their Vi|vacity.
Afterwards they went to their Aunt's Cham|ber,
and from thence attended her to <HI>Lucilla</HI>'s, who
was laid upon the Bed, &s;omewhat ca&s;t down with
the Fatigue of a Journey, and Want of Re&s;t; and

all the Spirit and Gayety that are generally met

with in Per&s;ons of her Quality, yet her Unea&s;ine&s;s

<P>Donna <HI>Juana</HI> made great Profe&s;&s;ions of her Friend|&s;hip,

&s;hould have not rea&s;on to repent what &s;he had done

made her the &s;ame A&s;&s;urances in &s;o tender and en|gaging

receiv'd: when Donna <HI>Juana</HI> interrupting the Di&s;|cour&s;e,
&s;aid, &startq;Of all the rare Qualities, Madam,

<HEAD>The Palace of Revenge.</HEAD>
<P>SOME time there lived a King and Queen of an
I&s;land, who after they had been married twen|ty
Years, had a Daughter, who&s;e Birth gave them
as much Joy, as the want of an Heir to &s;ucceed them
in their Dominions, had occa&s;ion'd Sorrow. The
young Prince&s;s was call'd <HI>Imis,</HI> and her growing
Charms from her Infancy promis'd Wonders in a
more advanc'd Age. Nobody in the whole World
would have de&s;erv'd her, had not Love, who thought
it would be to his honour to add to his Empire &s;o
wonderful a Per&s;on, taken care to have a Prince born
<PB N="90" REF="99">
in the &s;ame Court, that was as charming as the Prin|ce&s;s
<HI>Imis</HI> was lovely. This Prince, who was nam'd
<HI>Philax,</HI> was Son to the King's Brother, was two
Years older than the Prince&s;s, and they were edu|cated
together with all the Liberty their Nearne&s;s
of Blood and Youth gave them. The fir&s;t Emotions
of their Hearts yielded to Admiration and Tender|ne&s;s.
They &s;aw nothing &s;o beautiful as them&s;elves,
nor found any thing which could divert the Pa&s;&s;ion
they felt for each other, without knowing what to
call it. The King and Queen perceiv'd the Growth
of that Pa&s;&s;ion with plea&s;ure; they lov'd the young
<HI>Philax,</HI> he was a Prince of their Blood, and never
Child gave greater Hopes. Every thing &s;eem'd to
agree with Love to render <HI>Philax</HI> one day the hap|pie&s;t
of all Men. The Prince&s;s was about twelve
Years old, when the Queen, who lov'd her mo&s;t
tenderly, would con&s;ult a Fairy, who&s;e Fame made
a great noi&s;e, about her Fortune. She went to find
her, and took <HI>Imis</HI> with her, who, in her Grief to
leave <HI>Philax,</HI> wonder'd a hundred times how they
could think of what was to come, &s;ince the pre&s;ent
was &s;o agreeable. <HI>Philax</HI> remain'd with the King,
whom all the Plea&s;ures of the Court could not com|fort
for the Prince&s;s's Ab&s;ence. The Queen arriv'd
at the Fairy's Ca&s;tle, where &s;he was magnificently
receiv'd, but the Fairy was not there. She was ge|nerally
on the top of an high Mountain &s;ome di|&s;tance
from the Ca&s;tle, where &s;he lived by her&s;elf,
taken up with that profound Knowledge which
render'd her &s;o famous in the World. As &s;oon as
&s;he knew of the Queen's Arrival, &s;he came to her:
the Queen pre&s;ented the Prince&s;s to her, told her
her Name, the Hour of her Birth, all which the
Fairy knew before, and promis'd the Queen to give
her an An&s;wer in two Days, and then return'd to
the Mountain. The third Day &s;he came again, took
the Queen into the Garden, and gave her &s;ome Ta|bles
of Palm-tree Leaves clo&s;e &s;hut, but charg'd her
not to open them but before the King. The Queen,
<PB N="91" REF="100">
to &s;atisfy in &s;ome mea&s;ure her Curio&s;ity, ask'd her
&s;everal Que&s;tions about her Daughter's Fortune:
&startq;Great Queen, <HI>&s;aid the Fairy,</HI> I cannot tell you pre|ci&s;ely
what kind of Misfortune the Prince&s;s is
threaten'd with; only I &s;ee that Love will have
the greate&s;t &s;hare in the Accidents of her Life,
and that never Beauty created more violent Pa&s;&s;i|ons.&endq;
There was no need of a Fairy to promi&s;e
that Prince&s;s Admirers, her Eyes &s;eem'd already to
demand the Love of all the Hearts the Fairy a&s;&s;ur'd
her of. Neverthele&s;s <HI>Imis,</HI> not &s;o much di&s;turb'd at
her Fate, as at <HI>Philax</HI>'s Ab&s;ence, amus'd her&s;elf with
gathering Flowers: but taken up with her Tender|ne&s;s
and Impatience to be gone, &s;he forgot the
No&s;egay &s;he began to make, and dreaming, threw
away the Flowers &s;he had with plea&s;ure gather'd;
then went to the Queen, who took her leave of
the Mountain Fairy. The Fairy embrac'd <HI>Imis,</HI> and
looking on her with the Admiration &s;he de&s;erv'd;
&startq;Since 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for me <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> (after &s;ome
Moments of Silence, which had &s;omething my&s;te|rious
in it) &s;ince 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for me, fair Prin|ce&s;s,
to change in your favour the Orders of the
Fates, however I will endeavour to prevent the
Misfortunes prepared for you.&endq; After the&s;e Words
&s;he gather'd her&s;elf the Heads of Lillies, and ad|dre&s;hing
her&s;elf to the young <HI>Imis,</HI> &startq;Take the&s;e
Flowers which I give you, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> they will ne|ver
fade; and while you have them about you,
they will &s;ecure you again&s;t all the Misfortunes
Fate threatens you with.&endq; Afterwards &s;he fa&s;ten'd
the No&s;egay to her Headclothes, and the Flowers
obeying the Intention of the Fairy, as &s;oon as they
were on her Head adju&s;ted them&s;elves, and form'd
a Kind of Topping, who&s;e Whitene&s;s &s;erv'd only to
&s;hew that nothing could efface that of the fair <HI>Imis</HI>'s
Complexion. The Queen, after having return'd the
Fairy a thou&s;and Thanks, went away, and return'd
to the I&s;land, where the Court waited with impa|tience
to &s;ee the Prince&s;s again. Never Joy appear|ed
<PB N="92" REF="101">
greater than in the Eyes of <HI>Imis</HI> and her Lover&punc;
The King was the only Per&s;on that was inform'd
of the My&s;tery of the Bunch of Lillies; which had
&s;o agreeable an Effect on the Prince&s;s's fine brown
Hair, that every body took it only for an Ornament
&s;he had chus'd out of the Fairy's Garden. The
Prince&s;s &s;poke much more to <HI>Philax</HI> of the Trou|ble
&s;he underwent in not &s;eeing him, than of the
Misfortunes intended her. <HI>Philax</HI> however was
frighten'd, but the pre&s;ent Joy of meeting again,
and as the Misfortunes might be uncertain, they
gave them&s;elves up to the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing each
other again. In the mean time the Queen gave the
King an Account of their Journey, and gave him
the Tables the Fairy gave her, which the King
open'd, and found therein the&s;e Words written in
Letters of Gold:
<Q><L>Under the Gui&s;e of flatt'ring Hopes, hard Fate</L>
<L>Hides the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es that on <HI>Imis</HI> wait;</L>
<L>She mu&s;t unhappy now at la&s;t become,</L>
<L>And thro' good Fortune pa&s;t, meet an har&s;h Doom.</L></Q></P>
<P>The King and Queen were very much afflicted
with this Oracle, and &s;ought in vain to have it ex|pounded.
They &s;aid nothing of it to the Prince&s;s,
that they might not cau&s;e in her a u&s;ele&s;s Grief.
One day when <HI>Philax</HI> was gone a hunting, which
he did frequently, <HI>Imis</HI> was walking all alone in a
Wilderne&s;s of Myrtles, where &s;he was very melan|choly
becau&s;e <HI>Philax</HI> &s;tay'd &s;o long, and reproach'd
her&s;elf with an Impatience: &s;he was thus engag'd
in mu&s;ing and thinking, when &s;he heard a Voice
that &s;aid to her, &startq;Why do you afflict your &s;elf, fair
Prince&s;s? If <HI>Philax</HI> is not &s;en&s;ible enough of the
Happine&s;s of being belov'd by you, I come to offer
you an Heart a thou&s;and times more acknowledg|ing,
an Heart &s;en&s;ibly touch'd with your Charms,
and a Fortune worthy to be de&s;ir'd by any other
but you, who&s;e Empire the World ought to own.&endq;
The Prince&s;s was very much &s;urpriz'd to hear this
<PB N="93" REF="102">
Voice, &s;he thought her&s;elf alone in the Wilderne&s;s,
and as &s;he had not open'd her Mouth, &s;he was much
more amaz'd that that Voice &s;hould an&s;wer her
Thoughts. She look'd about her, and perceiv'd a
little Man in the Air, mounted on a large <HI>May</HI> Fly:
&startq;Fear not, fair <HI>Imis,</HI> &s;aid he to her, you have not
a more &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Lover than my &s;elf, and tho
this is the fir&s;t time I ever appear'd to you, I
have lov'd you long, and &s;ee you every day.&endq;
&startq;How much you amaze me! <HI>&s;aid the Prince&s;s
to him:</HI> What! do you &s;ee me every day, and
know what I think? Then you ought to &s;ee
that your Love is to no purpo&s;e. <HI>Philax,</HI> to
whom I have given my Heart, is too amiable
not to keep it; and tho' I may be a little vex'd
at him, I never lov'd him more than now: but
tell me who you are, and where you have &s;een
me.&endq; &startq;I am <HI>Pagan</HI> the Sorcerer, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> and my
Power extends over all the World but you. I
&s;aw you in the Garden of the Mountain Fairy, I
was hid in one of the Tulips you gather'd. I
look'd upon the Chance that made you gather
the Flower I was in, as an happy Pre&s;age, and
flatter'd my &s;elf you would take me along with
you: but you, too much engag'd with the Plea|&s;ure
of thinking on <HI>Philax,</HI> threw the Flowers
away, and left me in the Garden the mo&s;t amo|rous
of all Men. Ever &s;ince I have found that
nothing could make me happy, but the Hopes of
being belov'd by you. Think of me, fair <HI>Imis,</HI>
if po&s;&s;ible, and permit me &s;ometimes to remind
you of my Pa&s;&s;ion.&endq; After the&s;e Words he di&s;ap|pear'd,
and the Prince&s;s return'd to the Palace,
where the Sight of <HI>Philax</HI> di&s;&s;ipated the Fear &s;he
had been in. She was &s;o de&s;irous to hear him ju|&s;tify
him&s;elf for &s;taying &s;o long an Hunting, that
&s;he had almo&s;t forgot to tell him her Adventure;
but at la&s;t recollecting her&s;elf, told him what had
happen'd in the Wilderne&s;s. The young Prince,
notwith&s;tanding his Courage, fear'd a winged Ri|val,
again&s;t whom he could not contend for his
<PB N="93" REF="103">
Prince&s;s. But the Lillies encouraged him again&s;t
all Enchantments, and <HI>Imis's</HI> Tenderne&s;s for him
remov'd all Fears of a Change in her. The next
Morning when the Prince&s;s awak'd, &s;he &s;aw twelve
little Nymphs fly into her Chamber, who were all
&s;at on Bees, and brought in their Hands little Ba&s;|kets
of Gold. They went to the Prince&s;s, paid their
Re&s;pects to her, and then went and laid their Ba&s;|kets
on a Table of white Marble, which appear'd
in the middle of the Chamber; which Baskets when
they were laid down, became very large. The
Nymphs, after they had left their Baskets, took
their leaves of <HI>Imis,</HI> and one of them approaching
nearer to the Bed than the re&s;t, let &s;omething fall
on it, and then they all flew away. The Prince&s;s,
notwith&s;tanding her Surprize at &s;o &s;trange a Sight,
took up what the Nymph had let fall by her; which
was an Emerald of a wonderful Beauty, that open'd
as &s;oon as the Prince&s;s touch'd it, and contain'd a
Ro&s;e-Leaf, whereon the&s;e Ver&s;es were read:
<Q><L>All that gaze on your fair Eyes,</L>
<L>Mu&s;t with Plea&s;ure own their Pow'r;</L>
<L>With &s;uch Beauty they &s;urprize,</L>
<L>None can lo$k but mu&s;t adore.</L></Q></P>
<P>The Prince&s;s could not recover her A&s;toni&s;hment,
but call'd the Ladies that waited on her, who were
as much amaz'd as <HI>Imis</HI> at the &s;ight of the Table
and the Baskets. The King, Queen, and <HI>Philax,</HI>
ran at the noi&s;e of this Adventure; the Prince&s;s
&s;uppre&s;s'd nothing in her Relation but her Lover's
Letters, which &s;he thought &s;he was not oblig'd to
give an account of to any but <HI>Philax.</HI> The Baskets
were examin'd with Care, and were found full of
Jewels of extraordinary Beauty, and &s;o great Value,
that they redoubled the A&s;toni&s;hment of the Specta|tors.
The Prince&s;s would not touch them; and
having found an opportunity when nobody heard,
&s;he went to <HI>Philax,</HI> and gave him the Emerald and
Ro&s;e-Leaf. He read his Rival's Letter, which gave
<PB N="95" REF="104">
him a great Unea&s;ine&s;s, and <HI>Imis</HI> to comfort him tore
it before his face; but how dear was that Sacrifice
to them! Some Time pa&s;t without hearing any thing
of <HI>Pag$n:</HI> &s;he thought that her Di&s;dain had extin|gui&s;h'd
his Love, and <HI>Philax</HI> flatter'd him&s;elf with
the &s;ame Hope. When one day as the Prince was
returning from Hunting, as he u&s;ed to do, he &s;tay'd
all alone by a Fountain-&s;ide to refre&s;h him&s;elf, and
having the Emerald the Prince&s;s had given him
about him, and thinking on that Sacrifice with plea|&s;ure,
he took it out of his Pocket to look at it;
but he held it not a moment before it fell out of
his Hands, and as &s;oon as it touch'd the Ground
was chang'd into a Chariot, and pre&s;ently two wing|ed
Mon&s;ters came out of the Fountain and harne&s;s'd
them&s;elves to it. <HI>Philax</HI> look'd on them without
any Fear, being incapable of it; but could not but
feel &s;ome Concern when he &s;aw him&s;elf convey'd
into the Chariot by an invi&s;ible Power, and pre|&s;ently
lifted up in the Air, where the Mon&s;ters
flew with the Chariot with great Ea&s;e and Swift|ne&s;s.
In the mean time Night came on, and the
Hunters, after having &s;ought <HI>Philax</HI> to no purpo&s;e
thro all the Wood, return'd to the Palace, where
they thought to find him; but not meeting with him,
and nobody having &s;een him &s;ince he was with
them, the King order'd them to go back to &s;eek
him. The whole Court was in a great Unea&s;ine&s;s;
they return'd to the Wood, &s;earch'd it thro, and
came back at Day-break without learning any News
of the Prince. <HI>Imis</HI> pa&s;t the Night in De&s;pair for
her Lover's Ab&s;ence, the Occa&s;ion of which &s;he
could not imagine. She was then on a Terra&s;s-Walk
of the Palace, to &s;ee tho&s;e return who went
to find <HI>Philax,</HI> and flatter'd her&s;elf with &s;eeing him
come along with them. But i$ is impo&s;&s;ible to ex|pre&s;s
the Exce&s;s of her Grief when &s;he &s;aw none
of <HI>Philax,</HI> and when they told her they could not
tell what was become of him; &s;he &s;woon'd away,
and was carry'd to Bed, when one of her Atten|dants,
<PB N="96" REF="105">
with ha&s;te to undre&s;s her, took off her Head
the Bunch of Lillies that &s;ecur'd her again&s;t all
Enchantments; as &s;oon as that was off, a Cloud
darken'd the Chamber, and <HI>Imis</HI> di&s;appear'd. The
King and Queen were &s;o griev'd at this Lo&s;s, that
they were not to be comforted. The Prince&s;s com|ing
out of her Swoon, found her&s;elf in a Chamber
of Coral of divers Colours, inlaid with Mother of
Pearl, &s;urrounded with Nymphs, who paid her pro|found
Re&s;pect; they were all beautiful, and cloth'd
in magnificent Habits. At fir&s;t <HI>Imis</HI> ask'd where &s;he
was: &startq;You are in a Place where you are ador'd,
<HI>an&s;wer'd one of the Nymphs;</HI> Fear nothing, fair Prin|ce&s;s,
you will find here all you can de&s;ire.&endq; &startq;Is
<HI>Philax</HI> here, <HI>&s;aid the Prince&s;s,</HI> (with a Joy that ap|pear'd
in her Eyes) I only wi&s;h for the Happine&s;s
of &s;eeing him again.&endq; &startq;You remember too long
an ungrateful Wretch&punc; <HI>&s;aid</HI> Pagan, (appearing to the
Prince&s;s) and &s;ince that Prince has for&s;aken you,
he is not worthy of your Love; add Anger, and
the Value you have of your Honour, to the Pa&s;&s;i|on
I have for you, and reign here for ever, fair
Prince&s;s, where you will find immen&s;e Riches,
and all the Plea&s;ures you can de&s;ire.&endq; <HI>Imis</HI> re|turn'd
no An&s;wer to this Di&s;cour&s;e of <HI>Pagan</HI>'s but
by Tears, and he left her for fear of provoking her
Grief. The Nymphs &s;tay'd with her, and us'd all
their Endeavours to comfort her; they made her
a magnificent Entertainment, which &s;he refus'd to
ta&s;te of. But in &s;hort, the next day her De&s;ire to
&s;ee <HI>Philax</HI> again made her re&s;olve to live; &s;he ear,
and the Nymphs, to divert her Melancholy, carri|ed
her to &s;everal Parts of the Palace, which was
built of fine Shells, mix'd with precious Stones of
different Colours; and what was more &s;urprizing,
all the Furniture was of Gold, and of &s;o fine Work,
that it plainly appear'd to be wrought by Fairie$.
The Nymphs, after they had &s;hew'd <HI>Imis</HI> the Palace,
led her into the Garden, the Beauty of which is
not to be repre&s;ented; there they found a Ch$r$o$
<PB N="97" REF="106">
drawn by &s;ix Stags, drove by a Dwarf; they de&s;ir'd
her to get into it, which &s;he did, and they &s;at at
her Feet, and were carried to the Sea-&s;ide, where
one of them told the Prince&s;s that <HI>Pagan</HI> reign'd in
that I&s;land, which he had made by his Art the fi|ne&s;t
Place in the World. A Noi&s;e of In&s;truments
interrupted the Nymph's Di&s;cour&s;e, the Sea was co|ver'd
over with little Barks of Coral of a Fire-co|lour,
which were full of whatever could contribute
to a gallant Sea-Entertainment. In the mid&s;t of
the&s;e little Barks there was one much larger than
the re&s;t, drawn by two Dolphins, on which there
were Cyphers of <HI>Imis</HI> made with Pearls. It came
to the Shore, the Prince&s;s went into it, with the
Nymphs that were with her; as &s;oon as &s;he was in
it, there was a fine Collation before her, and &s;he
heard a fine Concert from the Boats that were
about hers; they &s;ung nothing but her Prai&s;es and
Commedations, but &s;he for her part gave no At|tention
to any thing. She went into her Chariot
again, and return'd to the Palace oppre&s;s'd with
Grief. That Night <HI>Pagan</HI> pre&s;ented him&s;elf again
before her, and found her more in&s;en&s;ible of his
Love than before; but he not di&s;hearten'd, flatter'd
him&s;elf with his Per&s;everance: he knew not that
the mo&s;t con&s;tant Lovers are not always the mo&s;t
happy; he made every day Entertainments for the
Prince&s;s, with Diver&s;ions worthy of the Admiration
of the whole World, but her for whom they were
de&s;ign'd. <HI>Imis</HI> was only concern'd for her Lover's
Ab&s;ence, who in the mean time was carried by the
winged Mon&s;ters into a Fore&s;t <HI>Pagan</HI> was Ma&s;ter of,
call'd, <HI>The di&s;mal Fore&s;t.</HI> As &s;oon as <HI>Philax</HI> arriv'd
there, the Emerald Chariot and Mon&s;ters di&s;ap|pear'd.
The Prince &s;urpriz'd at this Adventure,
call'd all his Courage to his Aid, which was the on|ly
Succours he could rely on there. He at fir&s;t ran
thro a great many Paths of the Fore&s;t, which was
frightful, and who&s;e Ob&s;$urity the Sun never pe|$netrated.
There he found nobody, not &s;o much as
<PB N="98" REF="107">
a living Creature of any kind; it &s;eem'd that Bea&s;ts
them&s;elves were terrified at &s;o di&s;mal an Abode.
<HI>Philax</HI> liv'd on &s;ome wild Fruits he found there, and
&s;pent his Days in a mortal Grief. His Ab&s;ence from
the Prince&s;s made him de&s;pair; and &s;ometimes he
amu&s;ed him&s;elf with his Sword, which he had with
him, to engrave <HI>Imis</HI>'s Name on Trees, which was
not de&s;ign'd for &s;o tender an U&s;e; but when we
love indeed, we make u&s;e of tho&s;e Things which
appear the mo&s;t contrary. Neverthele&s;s the Prince
kept going forwards, and had lived in the Fore&s;t
about a Year, when one Night he heard a complain|ing
Voice, who&s;e Words he could not di&s;tingui&s;h.
The Frights that the&s;e Complaints might occa&s;ion
in the Night, in a Place where the Prince had ne|ver
&s;een any body, and the De&s;ire of not being
alone, and to find at lea&s;t &s;ome as unfortunate as
him&s;elf, to whom he might tell his Misfortunes,
made him wait for Day with Impatience to find out
tho&s;e he heard. He went towards that part of the
Fore&s;t from whence he thought the Voice came,
and &s;ought about all day to no purpo&s;e; but at
length in the Evening he found, in a Place where
the Trees were thin, the Ruins of a Ca&s;tle, which
appear'd to have been very &s;pacious and lofty. He
went into a Court, the Walls of which were of
green Marble, and appear'd to be whole and en|tire;
there he found Trees of a prodigious Height,
planted irregularly up and down the Court. He
advanc'd farther, to a Place where he &s;aw &s;ome|thing
rai&s;ed on a Pede&s;tal of black Marble, which
appear'd to be Arms laid confu&s;edly on one another,
&s;ome Head-pieces, &s;ome Bucklers, and Swords, after
the old manner of Fighting, all which form'd a kind
of Trophy ill di&s;pos'd. He look'd if there was no
In&s;cription to inform him whom tho&s;e might have
belong'd to, and found one engrav'd on the Pede|&s;tal,
the Characters of which were almo&s;t effaced
by Time, but with great Pains he read the&s;e
Words:</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="108">
To the immortal Memory of the Fairy <HI>Ceorea,</HI>
<Q><L>Who in one Day triumph'd over Love,</L>
<L>And puni&s;h'd her unfaithful Lovers.</L></Q></P>
<P>This In&s;cription did not inform <HI>Philax</HI> in all he
wanted to know; &s;o that he had continu'd his
March in the Fore&s;t, had not Night come upon him.
He &s;at him&s;elf down at the foot of a Cypre&s;s Tree,
and had not been &s;at long, when he heard the &s;ame
Voice he had heard the Night before; but was more
&s;urpriz'd, when he perceiv'd tho&s;e Trees complain'd
like Men. He ro&s;e up, drew his Sword, and &s;truck
that Cypre&s;s which was the neare&s;t to him; and
was about to renew his Stroke, when the Tree
cry'd out, &startq;Hold, hold, hurt not an unfortunate
Prince, who is not in a Condition to defend him|&s;elf.&endq;
<HI>Philax</HI> held his Hand, and u&s;ing him&s;elf to
the&s;e &s;urprizing Adventures, ask'd the Cypre&s;s by
what Wonders he was both a Man and a Tree?
&startq;I will tell you, &s;aid the Cypre&s;s, and &s;ince for the&s;e
two thou&s;and Years this is the fir&s;t and only Oppor|tunity
I have had to make my Complaints, &s;hall not
neglect it: All the&s;e Trees you &s;ee here were
Princes, con&s;iderable in their Time by their Rank
and Courage. The Fairy <HI>Ceorea</HI> reign'd in this
Country; &s;he was hand&s;ome, but her Knowledge
render'd her more renown'd than her Beauty, &s;o
that &s;he made u&s;e of other Charms to &s;ubject us
unto her Laws. She was in love with the young
<HI>Orizeus,</HI> a Prince by his rare Qualities worthy of
a better Fortune, who is, <HI>added the Cypre&s;s,</HI> this
Oak you &s;ee by me.&endq; <HI>Philax</HI> look'd on the Oak,
and heard it fetch a great Sigh, which the remem|brance
of his Misfortunes undoubtedly forc'd from
him. &startq;The Fairy to draw this Prince to her
Court, <HI>continu'd the Cypre&s;s,</HI> publi&s;h'd a Tournament,
and we all ran at this &s;mall Opportunity of gain|ing
Glory. <HI>Orizeus</HI> was one of the Princes who
contended for the Prize again&s;t armed Fairies, who
<PB N="100" REF="109">
were invulnerable. I was unhappily Conqueror,
and <HI>Ceorea</HI> vex'd that Fortune had not declar'd her|&s;elf
agreeable with her Inclinations, was re&s;olv'd
to revenge her&s;elf on us; &s;he enchanted all the
Gla&s;&s;es, which the Gallery of her Ca&s;tle was full
of that they who only &s;aw her once repre&s;ented
in tho&s;e fatal Gla&s;&s;es, could not help feeling a
violent Pa&s;&s;ion for her. In that Place &s;he receiv'd
us the next day after the Tournament; we all
&s;aw her in tho&s;e Gla&s;&s;es, and found her &s;o hand|&s;ome,
that tho&s;e among us, who till then were
indifferent, were no longer &s;o; and tho&s;e who
lo$'d before, became as ea&s;ily unfaithful. We laid
a&s;ide all Thoughts of leaving the Fairy's Court,
we minded nothing but how to plea&s;e her: in
vain might our Affairs of State call us home to
our Dominions; all &s;eem'd unworthy of us, ex|cept
the Hope of being lov'd by <HI>Ceorea. Orizeus</HI>
was her only Favourite, and the Pa&s;&s;ions of the
other Princes only &s;erv'd the Fairy as Sacrifices
for this Lover, who was &s;o dear to her, and to
&s;pread abroad the Fame of her Beauty. Love
&s;eem'd for &s;ome time to have &s;often'd <HI>Ceorea</HI>'s cru|el
Temper, but after four or five Years rea&s;&s;uming
her former Fiercene&s;s, &s;he reveng'd her&s;elf on the
Princes her Neighbours, on the lea&s;t Occa&s;ions,
by the mo&s;t horrible Murders; and abu&s;ing the
Power her Enchantments gave her over us, made
us the Mini&s;ters of her Cruelty. <HI>Orizeus</HI> endea|vour'd
in vain to put a &s;top to her Inju&s;tice, for
tho &s;he lov'd him, &s;he would not obey him. One
day when I came from fighting with a Giant &s;he
&s;ent me again&s;t, and brought her the Arms of the
Vanqui&s;h'd, &s;he was alone in the Gallery of Gla&s;|&s;es;
I laid the Giant's Arms at her feet, and
&s;poke to her of my Love with an incredible Ar|dour,
which without doubt was augmented by
the Force of the Enchantments of the Place; but
&s;he, far from &s;hewing me any Acknowledgments
for my Succe&s;s and my Love, treated me with an
<PB N="101" REF="110">
in&s;upportable Di&s;dain, and retiring into a Clo&s;et,
left me alone in an inexpre&s;&s;ible De&s;pair and Rage.
I remain'd &s;ome time without knowing what Re|&s;olution
to take, for the Enchantments of the Fai|ry
would not permit us to fight <HI>Orizeus.</HI> Careful
of the Life of her Lover, the cruel <HI>Ceorea</HI> made
us jealous, and depriv'd us of the natural Inclina|tion
Men have to revenge them&s;elves on an hap|py
Rival. In &s;hort, after having walked about
&s;ome time in the Gallery, and remembring that
was the Place where I fir&s;t began to love; here
'twas, <HI>cry'd I,</HI> I took the fir&s;t Impre&s;&s;ions of a
Pa&s;&s;ion which cau&s;es my De&s;pair: I will puni&s;h
you fatal Gla&s;&s;es, who have &s;o often repre&s;ented
the unju&s;t <HI>Ceorea</HI> to me with that Beauty which
&s;educed my Heart and Rea&s;on; I will puni&s;h you
for having offer'd to my Regard &s;o many Charms.
At the&s;e words, taking the Giant's Club, which I
brought as a Pre&s;ent to <HI>Ceorea,</HI> I broke the Gla&s;|&s;es;
which was no &s;ooner done, but I felt more
Hate for the Fairy than I ever had Love. The
Princes my Rivals at the &s;ame time found their
Chains broke, and <HI>Orizeus</HI> him&s;elf became a&s;ham'd
of being lov'd by the Fairy. <HI>Ceorea</HI> endeavour'd to
&s;tay her Lover by her Tears: but he was in&s;en&s;ible
to her Grief, and maugre all her Cries, we went
both together to fly from this di&s;mal Abode; when
pa&s;&s;ing thro the Court where we now are, the
Heavens appear'd all on fire, a terrible Thunder
was heard, and we became immoveable. The
Fairy appear'd in the Air mounted on a large Ser|pent,
and addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf in a Tone that di&s;co|ver'd
her Rage; &startq;Fickle Princes, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> I will
inflict on you a Puni&s;hment that &s;hall have no
end for the Crime you have committed in break|ing
my Chains, which were too glorious for you;
and for you, ungrateful <HI>Orizeus,</HI> I triumph at la&s;t
over your Love. Satisfy'd with this Victory, I
will make you endure the &s;ame Puni&s;hment as
your Rivals, and <HI>order,</HI> added &s;he, <HI>in memory of this
<PB N="102" REF="111">
Adventure, that when the U&s;e of Gla&s;&s;es &s;hall be known to
the whole World, the breaking of one of tho&s;e fatal Mirrors
may be always a certain Pre&s;age of a Lover's Infidelity.</HI>
After &s;he had pronounc'd the&s;e Words &s;he di&s;ap|pear'd,
we were chang'd into Trees, and the cru|el
<HI>Ceorea</HI> without doubt left us our Rea&s;on to add
to our Sufferings. Time hath de&s;troy'd this &s;tate|ly
Ca&s;tle, which was the Witne&s;s of our Misfor|tunes,
and you are the only Per&s;on that has come
to this frightful Fore&s;t for the two thou&s;and Years
we have been here.&endq; <HI>Philax</HI> was about returning
an An&s;wer to the Cypre&s;s, when all on a &s;udden he
was tran&s;ported into a very fine Garden, where he
found a beautiful Nymph, who making up towards
him, with a &s;miling Air &s;aid, &startq;If you are willing,
<HI>Philax,</HI> I will &s;hew you within the&s;e three Hours
the Prince&s;s <HI>Imis.</HI>&endq; The Prince overjoy'd at a Pro|po&s;al
&s;o little expected, ca&s;t him&s;elf at her feet, to
&s;hew his Acknowledgment. At that very time <HI>Pa|gan</HI>
was in the Air with the Prince&s;s, conceal'd by
a Cloud. He had told her a thou&s;and times that
<HI>Philax</HI> was unfaithful, which &s;he always refus'd to
believe on the word of a jealous Lover; and he
conducted her to this place on purpo&s;e, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> to
convince her of the Lightne&s;s of a Prince, whom &s;he
prefer'd &s;o unju&s;tly. The Prince&s;s &s;aw <HI>Philax</HI> at
the Nymph's feet, and was vex'd &s;he could not de|ceive
her&s;elf on what &s;he dreaded &s;o much. <HI>Pagan</HI>
kept her at &s;uch a di&s;tance from the Earth, that it
was impo&s;&s;ible for her to hear what <HI>Philax</HI> and the
Nymph &s;aid, who, by his Orders, had pre&s;ented her|&s;elf
to the Prince. <HI>Pagan</HI> return'd with the Prin|ce&s;s
to the I&s;land, where, after he had convinc'd
her of <HI>Philax's</HI> Infidelity, he found he had only in|crea&s;ed
that Prince&s;s's Grief, and that &s;he was not
the more &s;en&s;ible towards him. Vex'd to &s;ee that
this pretended Infidelity, from which he hoped for
Succe&s;s, was of no u&s;e he re&s;olv'd to revenge him|&s;elf
on the Con&s;tancy of the&s;e two Lovers. He was
not &s;o cruel as the Fairy <HI>Ceorea,</HI> his Grandmother;
<PB N="103" REF="112">
therefore he thought on another Revenge than that
whereby &s;he puni&s;h'd her unhappy Lovers. He had
no mind either to de&s;troy the Prince&s;s, whom he
tenderly lov'd, or <HI>Philax,</HI> whom he had made en|dure
enough. But bounding his Revenge in put|ting
an end to a Pa&s;&s;ion &s;o contrary to his, he rai|&s;ed
in his I&s;land a Palace of Chry&s;tal, provided it
with all Things agreeable to Life, except the means
of going out of it, put into it Nymphs and Dwarfs
to &s;erve <HI>Imis</HI> and her Lover, and when every thing
was ready for their Reception, tran&s;ported them
both into it. They thought them&s;elves at fir&s;t at
the height of their Happine&s;s, and return'd <HI>Pagan</HI> a
thou&s;and Thanks for his gentle Anger, who in the
mean time would not &s;ee them &s;o &s;oon together;
but comprehending that in time that &s;ight would
not be &s;o cruel to him, left the Palace of Chry&s;tal,
after having engrav'd with a Stick this In&s;cription:</P>
<P>As Ab&s;ence was thought by <HI>Philax</HI> and <HI>Imis</HI> the great|e&s;t
of all Misfortunes, <HI>Pagan,</HI> to revenge him&s;elf on their
Con&s;tancy and Per&s;everance, hath condemn'd them here to
the perpetual Sight of each other.</P>
<P>It is reported, that at the end of &s;ome few Years
<HI>Pagan</HI> had his de&s;ired Revenge, and that <HI>Philax</HI> and
<HI>Imis</HI> accompli&s;hing the Mountain Fairy's Prediction,
wi&s;h'd with as much De&s;ire to find the Bunch of
Lillies again to de&s;troy the agreeable Enchantment,
as they had pre&s;erv'd it before with Care to &s;ecure

<HEAD>The Continuation of the Story of
Don Gabriel.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN <HI>Lucilla</HI> had made an end of her Story,
Donna <HI>Juana</HI> and her Neices return'd her
Thanks for the favour &s;he had done them&punc; and Don
<PB N="104" REF="113">
<HI>Lewis</HI> for his part neglected not to prai&s;e both her
Wit and great Genius: to which Donna <HI>Lucilla</HI> an|&s;wer'd
with all Mode&s;ty imaginable; when a Ser|vant
came to inform Donna <HI>Juana</HI> that Dinner was
ready, who de&s;ired her Nephew to admit the Pil|grims
to Table, and to receive them hand&s;omely.
As &s;oon as the Cloth was taken away, when the
Ladies withdrew, Donna <HI>Juana</HI> took <HI>Lucilla</HI> by the
Hand, and led her into her Clo&s;et; where, after
&s;ome Compliments, &s;he told her, that it was agreed
between her Nephew and her&s;elf that &s;he &s;hould go
to an E&s;tate &s;he had near <HI>Sevil,</HI> that &s;he &s;hould
leave her with Regret, but that after what &s;he had
done for Don <HI>Lewis,</HI> &s;he could not refu&s;e compleat|ing
his Happine&s;s, by marrying him, to pre&s;erve her
Honour and Reputation, and &s;ince by living with
an Husband &s;he lov'd &s;he would be the le&s;s &s;en&s;ible
of Solitude. <HI>Lucilla,</HI> who could not help blu&s;hing
when &s;he mention'd &s;o ha&s;ty a Marriage, told her
very civilly, &s;he &s;hould for the Time to come regu|late
her Conduct by her Orders; that &s;he was &s;or|ry
to lo&s;e her good Company, but &s;ince &s;he thought
it nece&s;&s;ary for her Repo&s;e, &s;he &s;houd not pre&s;ume
to di&s;&s;uade her from it. And then <HI>I&s;idora</HI> and <HI>Me|lanthia</HI>
came in, who were &s;o much prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd in
favour of <HI>Lucilla,</HI> and &s;he of them, that they lov'd
at the fir&s;t &s;ight. After they had declar'd how con|cern'd
they then both were to leave her, Donna
<HI>Lucilla</HI> &s;aid, &startq;How unfortunate am I to give you &s;o
much Trouble, and to be the Occa&s;ion of your
going from your own Hou&s;e; I fancied to my &s;elf
a thou&s;and Plea&s;ures from your Conver&s;ation, and
had never re&s;olv'd to have come from <HI>Sevil,</HI> had
I not form'd to my&s;elf a thou&s;and flattering Idea's.&endq;
The&s;e tender Words put the two Si&s;ters in mind of
their cruel Separation from Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> and the
Count, and rais'd in their Imaginations tho&s;e Tor|ments
they &s;hould endure by never &s;eeing them
more. They &s;igh'd, and the Tears ran down their
Cheeks &s;o p$ent$fully, that <HI>Lucilla,</HI> who look'd upon
<PB N="105" REF="114">
them as the Marks of their Friend&s;hip, throwing
her Arms about their Necks, embraced them, min|gling
her Sighs and Tears with theirs.</P>
<P>While they were thus afflicting them&s;elves, Don
<HI>Lewis</HI> was comforting Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> and the Count,
and giving them an account of the Situation of
their Affairs; who, tho they knew that their Pa&s;|&s;ions
were mi&s;placed, yet hoped that Time, Rea&s;on,
and their Per&s;everance, might make &s;ome Altera|tions
in their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es Hearts: But alas! what
Torments could be greater, than to be &s;eparated
from the Objects of their De&s;ires! As Don <HI>Lewis</HI>
was &s;en&s;ible of the cruel State they were in, he
did all that lay in his power to mitigate their Sor|rows,
&s;aying, &startq;Afflict not your&s;elves, my dear
Friends, I hope my Si&s;ters will know their
own Intere&s;ts; I will give you an opportunity
pre&s;ently to entertain them, for 'tis likely Donna
<HI>Juana</HI> will not be long before &s;he goes.&endq; &startq;Our
whole Dependance lies on you, <HI>reply'd they,</HI> there|fore
judge of our Acknowledgment by the Great|ne&s;s
of the Obligation; for, in &s;hort, we look up|on
the Love of tho&s;e two charming Per&s;ons as
the greate&s;t Happine&s;s that can attend us.&endq;</P>
<P>For Donna <HI>Juana,</HI> her Thoughts were not half
&s;o much employ'd upon her Journey, as how &s;he
&s;hould take her dear Mu&s;ician along with her; but
as &s;he was afraid of having &s;ome trouble given her,
&s;he waited with the utmo&s;t Impatience till the
Count's pretended Marriage was annulled, that &s;he
might conclude her own. In &s;hort, after a thou|&s;and
Reflections, her Tenderne&s;s prevail'd, and &s;he
&s;ent for the Count into her Clo&s;et, that &s;he might
have the more freedom of Di&s;cour&s;e; where the
fir&s;t thing &s;he &s;aid to him, was, &startq;Don <HI>E&s;tevus,</HI> I am
going away from this Hou&s;e to <HI>A$dalu&s;ia;</HI> will
you go along with me?&endq; &startq;Wherever you plea&s;e,
Madam, <HI>reply'd h$,</HI> and &s;hall think my&s;elf too hap|py,
that you will &s;uffer me.&endq; After that, Donna
<HI>Juana</HI> &s;aid all the obliging things &s;he could think
<PB N="106" REF="115">
of; and the hopes of bearing <HI>Melanthia</HI> company in
this Journey, made him in &s;o plea&s;ant a humour,
that he &s;aid &s;o many agreeable things as charmed
her.</P>
<P>Things were in this condition, when Donna <HI>Juana</HI>
went in the Evening to the little Box that &s;tood on
that &s;ide of the Park, which had a Clo&s;et that look'd
towards the Wood, which was full of Books and Pa|pers,
and of which &s;he kept the Key, and had lock'd
her&s;elf in, to look for &s;ome Writings. Now as &s;he
&s;eldom or ever came hither, Don <HI>Lewis</HI> pitch'd up|on
it as a proper place for Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> and the Count
to have the opportunity to entertain his Si&s;ters,
whom he left when he came to the Steps, telling
them he would go and acquaint his Friends of
their being there; charging them, if they loved
him or them&s;elves, not to neglect the making of
their Fortunes: which Donna <HI>Juana</HI> hearing, &s;he
never left li&s;tening attentively to all they &s;aid.</P>
<P>They were no &s;ooner up the Stairs, but <HI>I&s;idora</HI>
looking about, &s;aid to her Si&s;ter, &startq;This is the Place
&s;o fatal to our Quiet, this is the Place where we
fir&s;t heard the lovely Pilgrims; could we then
have thought that they made u&s;e of that Strata|gem
to &s;ee us?&endq; &startq;Ah! Si&s;ter, <HI>interrupted</HI> Melan|thia,
how well plea&s;ed &s;hould I have been, if
their Hearts or ours had not err'd in their Choice?
But what &s;hall we &s;ay to them? Shall we own
our Sentiments?&endq; &startq;What would you re&s;olve on,
Si&s;ter! <HI>reply'd</HI> I&s;idora: Is it not enough that we
hearken to theirs? Do we not wound our Duty,
by con&s;enting to this kind of Rendevous? And
does not my Brother, by leading us into an Ad|venture
we are &s;o little acquainted with, break
in upon all Rules of Decency?&endq; &startq;It was proper
to have made the&s;e Reflections before, <HI>interrupted</HI>
Melanthia <HI>again;</HI> but I mu&s;t tell you, I am afraid
of things of greater importance, I am more afraid
left Donna <HI>Juana</HI> &s;hould di&s;cover our Sentiments.&endq;
&startq;She would be very angry, <HI>reply'd</HI> I&s;idora, &s;ince &s;he
<PB N="107" REF="116">
has a great Tenderne&s;s for the Count, and has made
up a green Suit of Clothes embroider'd with Sil|ver,
on his account.&endq; &startq;Impo&s;&s;ible! <HI>&s;aid</HI> Melanthia;
the Extravagance is &s;o great, I can hardly believe
it.&endq; &startq;I prote&s;t 'tis truth, <HI>continued &s;he;</HI> and if you
ob&s;erve it, few old People regulate their Clothes
to their Years: they think to deceive the World
by their appearing gay, but in my opinion they
mo&s;t deceive them&s;elves.&endq; <HI>Melanthia</HI> was return|ing
&s;ome An&s;wer, when Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> and the Count
came in, who both made very low bows, but with
&s;uch an Air of Embara&s;&s;ment, that each &s;eem'd to
have their Thoughts very much employ'd, but dur&s;t
not declare their Sentiments. At la&s;t <HI>I&s;idora</HI> a&s;&s;u|ming
the Di&s;cour&s;e, &s;aid, &startq;If we have not given you
all the Re&s;pect that is owing to your Birth and
Worth, you ought to blame your&s;elves, &s;ince your
Di&s;gui&s;e was the Cau&s;e.&endq; &startq;Ah! Madam, <HI>reply'd
Don</HI> Gabriel, we ask for no Compliments; you
know our Pa&s;&s;ion and Intentions, vouch&s;afe but
to approve them, and we &s;hall be too happy: You
cannot doubt, <HI>continued he,</HI> but that your Merit
had all the power imaginable over us, &s;ince we
left <HI>Cadiz</HI> on purpo&s;e to &s;ee you; and knowing
the Severity of your Aunt, dre&s;&s;ed our&s;elves in
this Di&s;gui&s;e, which nothing but the Violence of
our Pa&s;&s;ion could have induced us to: Then think,
Madam, if we were capable of doing the&s;e things
before we &s;aw you, what we are uncapable of
after the &s;ight of &s;uch Beauties.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If, Madam, <HI>&s;aid the Count,</HI> you approve my Pa&s;|&s;ion,
if any of the Sighs and Vows I have offer'd
up to you, be agreeable, that Pa&s;&s;ion would en|gage
me to do any thing; but when my Complai|&s;ance
to Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> obliged me to bear him com|pany,
I look'd upon Love as a dangerous Rock I
could not too much avoid: the condition I &s;aw
him in, gave me a di&s;t$&s;te again&s;t any &s;uch Gal|lantry,
that I in a manner re&s;olved never to en|gage
in any &s;uch. $ut, O Heavens! what force
<PB N="108" REF="117">
had my Re&s;olution? when I &s;aw you, my Heart
was too much charmed to make the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;t+ance,
and &s;eem'd as if made only to love you.&endq;
The ju&s;t Dread you had of Love, Sir, <HI>reply'd</HI> Me|lanthia,
ought to be an In&s;truction to me how to
with&s;tand &s;uch an Engagement.&endq; &startq;I mu&s;t own,
<HI>a$&s;$er'd he,</HI> that Don <HI>Gabriel</HI>'s Chagrin was &s;o vio|lent,
that I was an hundred times in the mind to
have renounced his Friend&s;hip; but alas! you
have ju&s;tified him too much, and I was &s;atisfied
when I knew you, that there is a fatal Hour,
wherein all mu&s;t yield: But why &s;hould I name
that fatal Hour, &s;ince it lies in your power,
Madam, to make it the happie&s;t of my Life?&endq;
<HI>Melanthia</HI>'s confu&s;ed Silence put the Count into &s;uch
a Perplexity of Thoughts and Fears, that he dur&s;t
&s;ay no more to her; which &s;he perceiving by his
Eyes, told him, That the Declaration he expected
from her, was not in her own power, &s;ince he
could not be ignorant of her Duty to her Family,
as well as to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>As &s;o tender a Conver&s;ation could not be general
any long time, Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> de&s;ired to entertain <HI>I&s;i|dora</HI>
alone, and led her towards a kind of Alcove;
and <HI>Melamb$a,</HI> for her part, &s;at by the Door of
the Clo&s;et, with the Count at her feet: where, tho
they talk'd very low, <HI>Juana</HI> heard all they &s;aid.
What a cruel time had that poor Lady, to di&s;cover
that the Count was neither a Pilgrim, Mu&s;ician,
nor Ler Lover; but a Man of Birth and Fortune,
who was in love with her Neice, whom he de&s;ign'd
to marry, and that he did all that Man po&s;&s;ibly
could to touch her Heart, &s;wore, &s;igh'd, and pro|mis'd;
that <HI>Melanthia</HI> &s;eem'd no ways in&s;en&s;ible of
all he did, and that &s;he was made a fool of; nay,
that the Count ridiculed her about her chimerical
Marriage; who, in &s;hort, to tire her patience, &s;ang
the&s;e Ver&s;es&punc;

<L>In &s;ome private Grot retir'd,</L>

<LG>
<L>Age, alas! and hoary Hairs,</L>

<L>Wrinkles too may claim Re&s;pect,</L>
<L>But can't tender Love in&s;pire.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>In &s;hort, there was nothing omitted in this Con|ver&s;ation,
to convince Donna <HI>Juana</HI> of her Misfor|tune,
and 'tis not to be thought how &s;he was able
to bear it; for &s;he has &s;aid &s;ince, that &s;he had not
power to open the Door, and &s;hew her&s;elf. For <HI>I&s;i|dora</HI>
and <HI>Melanthia,</HI> they heard the Prote$tation of
their Lovers with a great deal of plea&s;ure, and &s;ince
they could not hope that they would change their
fir&s;t Sentiments, upon con&s;idering their Worth, and
the Advantage they had in &s;uch a Match, thought
in ju&s;tice they &s;hould no longer oppo&s;e them.</P>
<P>Never were two Lovers better &s;atisfied, they
began to gather hopes, which they never dur&s;t flat|ter
them&s;elves with before; for they always were
afraid, le&s;t <HI>I&s;idora</HI> being prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed for the Count,
and <HI>Melanthia</HI> for Don <HI>Gabriel,</HI> &s;hould refu&s;e to
&s;ubmit to any other Impre&s;&s;ions: they parted from
them with great reluctancy, having never ta&s;ted &s;o
much of Plea&s;ure before. The two Ladies applaud|ed
each other on the glorious Conque&s;ts they had
made; but the fir&s;t Impre&s;&s;ions had taken &s;o deep
root, that they thought a little time nece&s;&s;ary to be
a&s;&s;ured of their own Sentiments. Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> and
his Cou&s;in went to Don <HI>Lewis</HI> in <HI>Lucilla</HI>'s Chamber,
and <HI>I&s;idora</HI> and her Si&s;ter to their own Apartments;
and in the mean time Donna <HI>Juana</HI> recover'd a lit|tle
from her Surprize, got into the Hou&s;e, and lock|ing
her&s;elf up in her Clo&s;et, writ the following
Letter to the Count <HI>d'Aguilar.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="119">
&startq;YOUR noble Birth does not protect you from
the ju&s;t Reproaches you de&s;erve from me;
you have pretended you were wounded, and

you into my Hou&s;e, but al&s;o into my Heart:
but alas! while I exerci&s;ed my Ho&s;pitality, you
meditated my Ruin. You and your Cou&s;in have
both had the liberty to &s;ee my Neices, who are
young and innocent, and to engage their Hearts,
u&s;e them as you have done me; but don't think
me &s;o weak to forget your Ingratitude, which I
&s;hall carry with me to my Grave. Think on
what I would have done for you, when my Igno|rance
of your Fortune made you &s;eem &s;o much
below me; my Kindne&s;s de&s;erves all the Acknow|ledgment

&s;hall for the future be an&s;werable for their Con|duct;
and if they marry with you, I will not give
them a farthing.&endq;</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he had made an end of this Letter,
and had compo&s;ed her&s;elf, &s;he &s;ent for her Major-Domo,
and told him &s;he de&s;ign'd to go at midnight;
and therefore order'd him to be ready by that time
at the Park-Gate, and to let nobody know it, but
tho&s;e few Attendants that were to go with them,
whom he was to enjoin to Secrecy. Afterwards &s;he
&s;ent for her Nephew, and &s;aid to him, &startq;Believe me,
you mu&s;t lo&s;e no time to marry <HI>Lucilla,</HI> for you
mu&s;t think her Relations will come and take her
from you; and &s;ince you love her, and think the

<P>By this means the cunning <HI>Juana</HI> got rid of her

all that night a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Song, complaining of &s;lighted
Love, which was &s;et to a very agreeable Saraband,
which all the Company took notice of, e&s;pecially
the Count; who thinking it would not be ami&s;s to
carry matters fairly with her, approaching toward
her, &s;aid, &startq;What do you mean by this melancholy

knew more of their Intrigues than they thought
&s;he did, ob&s;erving all their Looks and Actions, had
much ado to forbear &s;peaking; but ma&s;tering her
Pa&s;&s;ion, &s;he at la&s;t only told them it was late, and
&s;o bid them good-night.</P>
<P>At midnight &s;he went into her Neices Chamber,

were dre&s;s'd and ready to go. They, for their parts,
&s;eeing neither their Brother nor Lovers appear,
were in the greate&s;t Con&s;ternation imaginable;
which <HI>Juana</HI> never minded, but hurried them away
in a Coach to <HI>Andalu&s;ia,</HI> without ever letting them
&s;o much as take their leaves of <HI>Lucilla.</HI> But how
great was the Surprize of our gallant Pilgrim, when
the Almoner came the next morning into his Cham|ber,
<PB N="112" REF="121">
and told him Donna <HI>Juana</HI> was gone, and deli|ver'd
her Letter; which when he had read over,
he gave it to Don <HI>Gabriel,</HI> $aying, &startq;We have been
betray'd, but how, or by whom, I cannot tell,
&s;ince we have tru&s;ted none with the Secret that
would di&s;cover it: Don <HI>Lewis</HI> has too much Ho|nour,
and <HI>Lucilla</HI> Di&s;cretion; and for <HI>I&s;idora</HI> or <HI>Me|lanthia,</HI>
'tis not probable they &s;hould, &s;ince <HI>Juana</HI>
&s;eems angry with them, and threatens them with
a Convent, and to di&s;inherit them: therefore &s;he
mu&s;t certainly have heard us, for &s;he knew where
we were.&endq; To which Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> &s;eeming mo&s;t
apt to give credit, &s;aid, &startq;Undoubtedly &s;he over|heard
us in the Box in the Park.&endq; &startq;Oh! <HI>cry'd the
Count,</HI> I remember as I &s;at with <HI>Melanthia</HI> by the
Clo&s;et-door, I often heard a noi&s;e, and fancied it
to be like &s;omebody &s;ighing, without its ever en|tring
into my head that &s;he had lock'd her&s;elf in
it. Good God! <HI>continued he,</HI> if <HI>Juana</HI> was there,
why did &s;he not come out, and tear out my Eyes?&endq;
&startq;What &s;he has done, <HI>reply'd Don</HI> Gabriel <HI>melancholily,</HI>
is more cruel than Death; believe me, &s;he is re|venged
enough, by taking away what is dearer to
us than the Light, I &s;hall never &s;ee <HI>I&s;idora</HI> again,
nor you <HI>Melanthia.</HI> Alas! we &s;hall never have the
liberty to &s;ee them, walk with them, and talk
with them again; <HI>Juana</HI> is &s;o much enraged a|gain&s;t
us, that &s;he will oppo&s;e all our De&s;igns, and
prepo&s;&s;e&s;s her Brother again&s;t us: it may be &s;he
may make her Neices change the Sentiments they
are hardly yet grounded in, either thro fear or
complai&s;ance. The Misfortunes and Troubles I
fore&s;ee, <HI>continued he,</HI> make me ready to die for
Rage and Grief, without knowing what to re|&s;olve
on.&endq;</P>
<P>The&s;e melancholy Reflections were follow'd by a
deep Silence, and they &s;eem'd more like Statues
than Men; but this Lethargy la&s;ted not long, for
the Almoner coming into their Chamber in a fright,
told them, that the Ca&s;tle was inve&s;ted by armed
<PB N="113" REF="122">
Men, who demanded Entrance; that he had but
ju&s;t time to &s;ecure all the Doors; that they threat|ned
to break them open; and that if they thought
fit to do it, they were not able to oppo&s;e them.
Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> and the Count were as much &s;urprized
at this News, as unre&s;olved what to do. &startq;Let us
pre&s;erve <HI>Lucilla</HI> for Don <HI>Lewis, &s;aid the Count;</HI>
'tis the greate&s;t piece of &s;ervice we can do him.&endq;
&startq;You don't pretend, <HI>interrupted Don</HI> Gabriel, to hold
out a Siege again&s;t this little Army.&endq; &startq;No, <HI>reply'd
the Count;</HI> but I pretend that we may take hor&s;e,
and carry <HI>Lucilla</HI> off by the Park-Gate, where
there is no appearance of their being po&s;ted, and
get to <HI>Tuy,</HI> and pa&s;s the River <HI>Men&s;tio;</HI> and when
we are in <HI>Valencia,</HI> we &s;hall be out of danger, &s;ince
it belongs to <HI>Portugal.</HI>&endq; &startq;What confounds me, <HI>&s;aid
the Almoner,</HI> is, the Hor&s;es that are left here are
good for nothing, and our Affairs are &s;o urgent,
that we cannot go any where to get better.&endq;
Whereupon Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> told him, they mu&s;t do the
be&s;t they could, &s;ince there were no other mea&s;ures
to be taken.</P>
<P>Afterwards they went into Donna <HI>Lucilla</HI>'s Cham|ber,
to acquaint her, and met her coming to theirs.
&startq;Ah! Sir, <HI>&s;aid &s;he to the Count, who went fir&s;t,</HI> I am
lo&s;t, if you find not out &s;ome way to &s;ave me; my
Grandfather is come, with the Per&s;on he de&s;igns
to marry me to, I &s;aw them from the Turret, they
are accompanied with a great number of their Re|lations
and Friends. Alas! <HI>continued &s;he, crying,</HI>
what an unhappy Wretch am I, to be the cau&s;e of
&s;o much di&s;turbance in my own Family, and &s;o
much trouble to Don <HI>Lewis!</HI> For how great mu&s;t
his Grief be, if as a Recompence for all his Pains,
he finds me in the power of his Rival?&endq; &startq;Fair
<HI>Lucilla, &s;aid the Count,</HI> be per&s;uaded that we will
&s;erve you as much as Don <HI>Lewis</HI> would, were he
here; we have determin'd to carry you off, and
not defer it a moment.&endq; Afterwards he put on
her Veil, and taking her by the Hand, led her down
<PB N="114" REF="123">
&s;tairs, &s;et her on hor&s;eback behind Don <HI>Gabriel,</HI>
and him&s;elf mounted the Almoner's Mule, and then
went thro the Park without any Ob&s;tacle, and made
the be&s;t of their way with their &s;orry Tits; and
would have been glad to have had their own Hor&s;es,
if they could have &s;ent to <HI>Ciudad-Redrigo,</HI> where
their Valet had lain with them &s;ince their fir&s;t Re|ception
at Donna <HI>Juana</HI>'s, but their Circum&s;tances
would not allow of it.</P>
<P>Don <HI>Ferdinand de la Vega,</HI> who was the Per&s;on that
was to have marry'd <HI>Lucilla,</HI> concern'd both for his
Honour and Love, did all he po&s;&s;ibly could to irri|tate
her Grandfather and Relations; and fearing lest
Don <HI>Lewis</HI> &s;hould e&s;cape with her by &s;ome Back|door,
as &s;oon as he arrived, engaged &s;ome Pea&s;ants
to watch, who knowing the Park-Gate, pretended
to be working in the next Field, and &s;eeing <HI>Lucilla</HI>
and the two Gentlemen come out there, went and
inform'd Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> of it. He was a young
hot-headed Man, not brave, but capable of doing
any ba&s;e Action; and thinking it would be in vain
for him to attack Don <HI>Lewis</HI> alone without an ad|vantage,
took two Cou&s;ins and two Valets, all well
mounted, along with him, and knowing what Road
<HI>Lucilla</HI> was gone, po&s;ted them&s;elves in a thick Wood
they were to pa&s;s through; where being favour'd by
the Trees, they were &s;o cowardly as to fall on Don
<HI>Gabriel</HI> and the Count, without giving them any no|tice.
Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> was wounded in the Knee, and
the Count had his right Arm broke; and his Mule
being frighten'd with the Fire, and Report of the
Piece, ran away with him: and he not having
Strength to hold him in, and endeavouring to
throw him&s;elf off, his Foot hung in the Stirrup,
and he was dragg'd a great way, till the Girt broke
at la&s;t, and he was lest wallowing in his Blood.</P>
<P>Don <HI>Lewis</HI> was returning from <HI>Compo&s;tella</HI> with the
Archbi&s;hop's Licence, promi&s;ing to him&s;elf all ima|ginable
Felicity, when perceiving a Man lying almo&s;t
dead, tho he did not know him, by rea&s;on his Face
<PB N="115" REF="124">
was all over Blood and Du&s;t, yet, notwith&s;tanding
the ha&s;te he was in to get home, he could not think
of leaving him to the care of his Gentleman and
his Valet, but mu&s;t go towards him: But, O Hea|vens!
what a Meeting was this to &s;o true a Friend?
He ha&s;ten'd off from his Hor&s;e, and embracing the
Count, could not refrain from Tears; and while
the Valet went to a Spring that was hard by, Don
<HI>Lewis</HI> and his Gentleman examin'd his Wounds,
which when they had wa&s;h'd, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted him all
that lay in their power, the Count began to breathe,
and opening his Eyes, knew Don <HI>Lewis.</HI> &startq;What
do you here? <HI>&s;aid he, in &s;o low a Voice, that he could
hardly be heard;</HI> run to <HI>Lucilla,</HI> who will be taken
away, in the next Wood, where Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> is
wounded.&endq; Don <HI>Lewis,</HI> at this di&s;mal News, was
ju&s;t ready to expire, not knowing what to do in
&s;uch an Extremity, having two Friends dead or dy|ing,
and a Mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;o dear to him, in the power of
his Enemies; at la&s;t re&s;olving to follow her, and to
die or bring her back, he left his Gentleman with
the Count, and &s;ent his Valet for A&s;&s;i&s;tance: But
before he went, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to his Friend,
&s;aid, &startq;I am going to &s;uccour <HI>Lucilla</HI> and Don <HI>Ga|briel,</HI>
it &s;hall not be long before I revenge you,
and return.&endq; With that mounting his Hor&s;e, he
rid with all &s;peed to the Wood, where he heard loud
Shrieks, which he knew to be <HI>Lucilla</HI>'s Voice, who
made all the re&s;i&s;tance &s;he was capable of, again&s;t
Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and one of his Servants, who were
&s;etting her upon an Hor&s;e; for Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> had kil|led
two of the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ines, and the others had under|gone
the &s;ame fate, if they had not conceal'd them|&s;elves
behind &s;ome Bu&s;hes and Trees, from whence
they knock'd him down: when <HI>Lucilla</HI> &s;eeing her|&s;elf
void of all Defence, was for running away, but
was &s;topt by Don <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> who u&s;ed a great deal
of Violence to carry her away.</P>
<P>At this &s;ight Don <HI>Lewis,</HI> more furious than a
young Lion robb'd of his Prey, flew on tho&s;e two
<PB N="116" REF="125">
ba&s;e Adver&s;aries, whom he &s;oon laid &s;prawling on
the ground. What a Slaughter was here, four Men
dead on one &s;ide, and Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> on the other
without any &s;en&s;e of Life! Don <HI>Lewis</HI> and <HI>Lucilla</HI>
ran to him, and this Scene was no le&s;s melancholy
than that between him and the Count <HI>d'Aguilar;</HI>
neither was his Confu&s;ion any ways the le&s;s, for he
thought if he left his Friend, he &s;hould be guilty
of the greate&s;t Ba&s;ene&s;s, and if he &s;tay'd, he ran
the hazard of lo&s;ing <HI>Lucilla</HI> again. But as he was
con&s;idering on what he &s;hould do, he heard a
noi&s;e, and looking about, perceiv'd it was his Gen|tleman,
whom he had &s;ent to get a&s;&s;i&s;tance to car|ry
Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> to a Friend's Hou&s;e that was hard by;
and in the mean time he obliged <HI>Lucilla</HI> to hide her|&s;elf
in the thicke&s;t part of the Wood: and the
Dread he was in, after the Misfortune of two &s;uch
Friends, was inexpre&s;&s;ible; he fear'd le&s;t &s;ome Ill
&s;hould befall his Mi&s;tre&s;s, and that &s;ome Serpent or
venomous Creature &s;hould bite her. Alas! his Soul
was full of Grief and Di&s;tru&s;t.</P>
<P>Tho Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> &s;eem'd to be dead, yet Don <HI>Lew|is</HI>
entertain'd &s;ome hopes of his Recovery, and fol|low'd
after with <HI>Lucilla</HI> to his Friend's Hou&s;e, where,
by &s;ome Remedies that were apply'd, they brought
him out of his Swoon, and after &s;earching his
Wounds, found none of them dangerous. Don <HI>Lewis</HI>
having thus put him into good hands, and knowing
that the Count was at a Gentleman's Hou&s;e he was
well known to, he left his Gentleman to take care
of them, and mounted his Hor&s;e again, accompanied
by two brave young Gentlemen, his Friend's Sons;
having fir&s;t taken his leave of Don <HI>Gabriel,</HI> and
thank'd him for the generous manner of his pre&s;erv|ing
his <HI>Lucilla,</HI> and a&s;&s;ured him <HI>I&s;idora</HI> &s;hould have
no other Per&s;on than him: and then went directly
for <HI>Portugal,</HI> where he married his beloved <HI>Lucilla.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time, the Grandfather and all his
Friends had got into Don <HI>Felix de Sarmiento</HI>'s Hou&s;e,
where they waited for Don <HI>Ferdinand de la Vega</HI>'s
<PB N="117" REF="126">
bringing <HI>Lucilla</HI> back. When Night came, and was
far advanced, and they heard no News of him, they
grew unea&s;y, and &s;ent to &s;eek for him; but upon
hearing of his Misfortunes, both <HI>Lucilla</HI>'s Grand|father
and his Father expre&s;s'd an uncon&s;olable Af|fliction;
and as they were both old, and wanted
that Vigour the&s;e &s;orts of Actions require, and were
no longer animated by the young Sparks that were
with them, they returned to <HI>Sevil,</HI> to pur&s;ue their
Proceedings again&s;t Don <HI>Lewis.</HI></P>
<P>For Donna <HI>Juana,</HI> &s;he was &s;o much enraged,
that &s;he took the Road to <HI>Malaga,</HI> without letting
her Neices know where &s;he was going, and car|ried
them to a Convent, wherein &s;he her&s;elf had
been educated: where after having had a little pri|vate
Di&s;cour&s;e with the Abbe&s;s, &s;he put them in,
&s;aying to them, &startq;I would not tell you what rea&s;on
I had to complain of you, but depend upon it, I
know all, and am grieved to the heart, to think
that you &s;hould &s;uffer tho&s;e young Gentlemen, who
were di&s;gui&s;ed, &s;o nigh you, who would have ru|in'd
your Reputations; therefore I leave you here
to expiate &s;o great an Offence, from whence you
&s;hall not &s;tir, unle&s;s by your Father's Orders.&endq;
&startq;Madam, <HI>reply'd</HI> I&s;idora, <HI>with a re&s;pectful Haughtine&s;s,</HI>
we have done nothing wherewith we can reproach
our&s;elves; and if you know what has pa&s;s'd, you
are &s;en&s;ible al&s;o that we did not know the Names
of tho&s;e Gentlemen till the Day before the Night
we came away. You may remember, that when
you determined to make them &s;tay, we did all
we could to further their Departure; then how
could we have any Corre&s;pondence, &s;ince we
were &s;o much vex'd to &s;ee them in our Hou&s;e?
'Tis true indeed, they have declared their Senti|ments
without our being angry, &s;ince they are &s;o
very advantageous to us; and had we the honour
of plea&s;ing you, we &s;hould not neglect &s;o favour|able
an Opportunity.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="127">
As Donna <HI>Juana</HI> could not bring any good Argu|ments
to di&s;pute with her Neices, &s;he loaded them
with Injuries; for her Infatuation for the Count,
in&s;tead of dimini&s;hing by his Ab&s;ence, rather in|creas'd:
which, with the &s;mall Hopes &s;he had to
engage him, made her perfectly outrageous. <HI>I&s;idora</HI>
and <HI>Melanthia</HI> went into the Convent, where they
thought to have met with all the Liberty their ci|vil
Behaviour de&s;erv'd, but the Doors were no &s;oon|er
&s;hut upon them, but they were $old that they
were not to &s;ee any body, and were to be debarr'd
the u&s;e of Pen, Ink, and Paper, and were not
to be left alone; for Donna <HI>Juana</HI> had made the
Abbe&s;s believe, that &s;ome Per&s;ons very much beneath
them de&s;ign'd to &s;teal them away with their own
Con&s;ents, and that they could not be watch'd too
narrowly.</P>
<P>This Precaution was the main Cau&s;e why the
Old Lady's De&s;igns had not their de&s;ir'd Effects;
the Abbe&s;s made choice of Ladies of the be&s;t Fa|&s;hion
among the Religious to be with the&s;e two
fair Pri&s;oners; among them Donna <HI>Iphigenia d' Agui|lar</HI>
was named as the chief, becau&s;e &s;he had Cor|re&s;pondence
with none but her Relations, among
whom, &s;uch poor &s;orry Wretches as Donna <HI>Juana</HI>
repre&s;ented her Neices Lovers to be, could not har|bour.
Donna <HI>Iphigenia</HI> was endued with a great
&s;hare of Wit and Sweetne&s;s of Temper, who find|ing
a great deal of Worth in her new Pupils, and
&s;eeing them very melancholy, did all &s;he could to
divert them. But it was not long before &s;he &s;tood
in need of the &s;ame piece of Service; for receiving
a Letter which the Count <HI>d'Aguilar</HI> her Brother had
order'd to be writ, in which he told her where he
was, never mentioning what Rencounter he had been
in, but only recommending him&s;elf to her Prayers,
telling her he was wounded, and in great pain, and
that Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> was in the &s;ame Condition; <HI>I&s;idora</HI>
ob&s;erv'd her turn pale, and ask'd her the rea&s;on,
who told her &s;he was very much griev'd, and gave
<PB N="119" REF="128">
her the Letter, who, as &s;oon as &s;he read it, gave
a Shriek, and fell backwards into a great Chair;
whereupon <HI>Melanthia</HI> ran to her, and <HI>I&s;idora,</HI> with|out
being able to &s;peak, gave her the Letter, at
which <HI>Melanthia</HI> expre&s;s'd no le&s;s Affliction than
her Si&s;ter.</P>
<P><HI>Iphigenia</HI> had never told them the Name of her
Family, her Mode&s;ty was too great to &s;uffer her to
boa&s;t of Things which were not agreeable with a
religious Life; for that rea&s;on &s;he had never men|tion'd
the Count and Don <HI>Gabriel:</HI> but the Grief they
&s;hew'd, exceeded &s;o much that of a Friend, and
their Sen&s;ibility appear'd &s;o great, that &s;he could
not but attribute it to &s;ome Tenderne&s;s of another
nature; when looking at them without &s;peaking,
<HI>I&s;idora</HI> gue&s;&s;ing at her Thoughts, &s;aid, &startq;Be not &s;ur|priz'd,

Melanthia, waited not for the Knowledge of your

more towards his Cure than all the Remedies

<P>The Me&s;&s;enger made all the ha&s;te he could to re|lieve

<HEAD>The Story of ANGUILLETTA.</HEAD>
<P>_HOW great &s;oever Fortune may rai&s;e tho&s;e
&s;he favours, yet there is no Happine&s;s ex|empt
from Trouble. Tho&s;e who ha$e any
Knowledge of the Fairies, cannot be ig$o|rant,
that they, as wi&s;e as they &s;eem, have not yet
found out the Secret of &s;ecuring them&s;elves from $he
Misfortune of changing their Shapes &s;ome Days in
every Month, and a&s;&s;uming that of a Bird, $word$,
or Fi&s;h.</P>
<P>On the&s;e fatal Days, when they are left a Prey
to the Cruelty of Men, it is often difficult for them
to &s;ave them&s;elves from the Danger to which this
hard Nece&s;&s;ity expo&s;es them.</P>
<P>One of them, who transform'd her&s;elf into an
Eel, was unluckily taken by &s;ome Fi&s;hermen, who
put her pre&s;ently into a Ci&s;tern of Water in the
middle of a fine Meadow, where they kept the Fi&s;h
re&s;erv'd for the King's Table.</P>
<P><HI>Anguilletta,</HI> which was the Fairy's Name, found
there a great many fine Fi&s;h, and heard the Fi&s;her|men
&s;ay to one another, &startq;that the King made that
night a great Entertainment, for which tho&s;e Fi&s;h
had been carefully pick'd out.&endq;</P>
<P>What di&s;mal News was this for the unhappy Fai|ry,
who accu&s;ed her Fate a thou&s;and times, and
&s;igh'd grievou&s;ly when &s;he got to the bottom, whi|ther
&s;he went that &s;he might bewail her Misfor|tune
the more privately? The de&s;ire of avoiding
the impending Danger, made her look abroad on all
&s;ides, to &s;ee if there was any way to e&s;cape, and re|gain
<PB N="124" REF="133">
the River, which was but a &s;mall di&s;tance
from thence; but it prov'd all in vain, the Ci&s;tern
was too deep to hope to get out of it without A&s;|&s;i&s;tance:
and her Fears increa&s;ed when &s;he &s;aw the
Fi&s;hermen, who took her, approaching, who put in
their Nets; and <HI>Anguilletta</HI> by avoiding them thought
only to defer her Death for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>At that In&s;tant the King's younge&s;t Daughter, who
was then walking in the Meadow, came to the Ci|&s;tern
to amu&s;e her&s;elf with looking at the Fi&s;h;
when the Sun, which was then about &s;etting, &s;hi|ning
in the Water, <HI>Anguilletta</HI>'s Skin, which was
&s;treak'd with Gold, appear'd &s;o bright, that the
Prince&s;s took notice of it, and finding it very
beautiful, bid the Fi&s;hermen take that Eel, and
give it her.</P>
<P>When the Prince&s;s had look'd on <HI>Anguilletta</HI> &s;ome
time, mov'd with Compa&s;&s;ion, &s;he ran to the River|&s;ide,
and threw her in; which unhoped for Service
touch'd the Fairy's Heart with &s;o lively an Ac|knowledgment,
that &s;he appear'd that very moment
on the top of the Water, and &s;aid to the Prince&s;s,
&startq;I owe my Life to you, generous <HI>Plou&s;ina,</HI> (which
was the Name of the Prince&s;s) which is a great
Happine&s;s for you. Be not afraid, <HI>continu'd &s;he,</HI>
&s;eeing her going to run away, I am a Fairy, and
will &s;atisfy you in the truth of my words by
what I will do for you.&endq;</P>
<P>As they were u&s;ed to &s;ee Fairies in tho&s;e Days,
<HI>Plou&s;ina</HI> took Courage, and gave great Attention to
<HI>Anguilletta</HI>'s agreeable Promi&s;es, and was about to
make &s;ome An&s;wer; when the Fairy interrupting
her, &s;aid, &startq;Stay till you have receiv'd my Favours,
before you a&s;&s;ure me of your Acknowledgment.
Go, young Prince&s;s, and come here again to|morrow
morning; wi&s;h for what you would have,
and I will as &s;oon accompli&s;h it: chu&s;e either
perfect Beauty, a lively piercing Wit, or va&s;t
Riches.&endq; After the&s;e words, <HI>Anguilletta</HI> dived in
<PB N="125" REF="134">
the Water, and left <HI>Plou&s;ina</HI> very well &s;atisfied with
her Adventure.</P>
<P>She re&s;olved to tru&s;t nobody with what had
happen'd to her; for &s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf, &startq;If <HI>An|guilletta</HI>
&s;hould deceive me, my Si&s;ters may think
this a Story I have invented.&endq;</P>
<P>After this &s;hort Reflection &s;he return'd to $er
Train, which con&s;i&s;ted only of a few Women, whom
&s;he found looking for her.</P>
<P>All that Night the young <HI>Plou&s;ina</HI> was engag'd
in the Choice &s;he was to make; that of Beauty
had a great Sway with her, but as &s;he had Wit
enough to de&s;ire more, &s;he re&s;olved to ask th$
Favour of the Fairy.</P>
<P>She ro&s;e next day with the Sun, ran to the Mea|dow,
as &s;he &s;aid, to gather Flowers to make a Gar|land,
to pre&s;ent to her Mother when &s;he was up.
But at the &s;ame time while her Women di&s;per&s;ed
them&s;elves in the Meadow, which was all enamell'd,
to pick out the fine&s;t and &s;weete&s;t Flowers, the
young Prince&s;s &s;tole to the River-&s;ide, and found
at the place where &s;he had &s;een the Fairy, a Pillar
of white Marble perfectly fine, which pre&s;ently
open'd, and the Fairy came out of it; who was no
longer a Fi&s;h, but a beautiful Woman, of a maje&s;tick
Air, who&s;e Head-dre&s;s and other Apparel were
cover'd over with Jewels: &startq;I am <HI>Anguilletta, &s;aid
&s;he to the young Prince&s;s, who lock'd at her with great
Attention,</HI> and come to perform my Promi&s;e; you
have made choice of Wit, you &s;hall have from
this moment enough to de&s;erve the Envy $word$ all
tho&s;e who hitherto have pretended to it.&endq;</P>
<P>The young <HI>Plou&s;ina</HI> after the&s;e words found her|&s;elf
quite different from what &s;he was an In&s;tant
before; &s;he thank'd the Fairy with an Eloquence,
which till then &s;he had never been Mi&s;tre&s;s of, the
Fairy &s;miling at the Prince&s;s's Amazement to find
&s;o much ea&s;e in expre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf.</P>
<P>&startq;I am &s;o well plea&s;ed, <HI>continu'd the kind</HI> Anguil|letta,
at the Choice you have preferably made to
<PB N="126" REF="135">
Beauty, which People of your Age are &s;o much
delighted with, that to recompence you I will
be&s;tow that Beauty on you, which you this day
have &s;o prudently neglected. Come again to-mor|row
at the &s;ame Hour, I give you that time to
chu&s;e how beautiful you would be.&endq;</P>
<P>Then the Fairy di&s;appearing, left the young <HI>Plou|&s;ina</HI>
more plea&s;ed than ever: the Choice of Wit was
the effect of her Rea&s;on, but the Promi&s;e of Beauty
flatter'd her Heart; and what reaches that, we are
generally the mo&s;t affected with.</P>
<P>The young Prince&s;s leaving the River-&s;ide, went
to receive the Flowers her Women pre&s;ented her
with, of which &s;he made a very agreeable Garland,
and carried it to the Queen; but how &s;urprized
was that Prince&s;s, the King, and the whole Court,
when they heard the young <HI>Plou&s;ina</HI> &s;peak with a
Grace that captivated their Hearts!</P>
<P>The Prince&s;&s;es her Si&s;ters &s;trove in vain to think
her le&s;s witty than others, but were forced to yield
even to their A&s;toni&s;hment and Admiration.</P>
<P>At night the Prince&s;s, po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with the Hopes
of being hand&s;ome, in&s;tead of going to Bed &s;at up
in her Clo&s;et, which was hung with Pictures, which
repre&s;ented, under the Figures of Godde&s;&s;es, all the
Queens and Prince&s;&s;es of her Hou&s;e; and as all
tho&s;e Pictures were very fine, &s;he hoped they might
be a&s;&s;i&s;ting to her in the choice of a Beauty worthy
of being ask'd of the Fairy.</P>
<P>A <HI>Juno</HI> pre&s;ented her&s;elf fir&s;t to her Eyes, fair,
and &s;et off with an Air fit to repre&s;ent the Queen
of the Gods; <HI>Pallas</HI> and <HI>Venus</HI> were by her: this
Piece being the Judgment of <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>The young Prince&s;s was very much plea&s;ed with
the Pride and Stateline&s;s of <HI>Pallas,</HI> but the Beauty
of <HI>Venus</HI> inclin'd her there to fix her Choice; ne|verthele&s;s
&s;he pa&s;&s;ed on to the next, where &s;he &s;aw
<HI>Pomona</HI> leaning on a Bed of Turfs, under Trees
loaded with the fine&s;t Fruits, who &s;eem'd &s;o charm|ing,
that the Prince&s;s, who &s;ince the morning knew
<PB N="127" REF="136">
every thing, was not &s;urprized that a God had
a&s;&s;umed &s;o many Shapes to &s;trive to plea&s;e her.</P>
<P><HI>Diana</HI> appear'd next, as repre&s;ented by the Poets,
with a Quiver on her Back, and a Bow in her
Hand, pur&s;uing a Stag, and follow'd by her
Nymphs.</P>
<P><HI>Flora</HI> appear'd a little more careful; &s;he &s;eem'd
walking in a Parterre, the Flowers of which, tho
admirable, came not up to her Complexion: next
her were the <HI>Graces,</HI> who look'd beautiful and en|gaging.</P>
<P>But the Prince&s;s was mo&s;t &s;truck with a Picture
that hung over the Chimney, which was the God|de&s;s
of Youth; a charming Air appear'd thro the
whole Figure, the Hair was of the fine&s;t white,
the Turn of her Face admirable, the Mouth deli|cate,
the Shape and Brea&s;ts perfectly fine and beau|tiful,
and her Eyes appear'd more formidable to
di&s;turb our Rea&s;on, than the Nectar &s;he was feign'd
to pour out.</P>
<P>&startq;I will, <HI>cry'd the young Prince&s;s, viewing that lovely
Portrait,</HI> be as beautiful as <HI>Hebe,</HI> and if po&s;&s;ible as
la&s;ting.&endq;</P>
<P>After this &s;he went into her Chamber, where
the Day &s;he expected &s;eem'd too &s;low to &s;econd her
Impatience; but at length appearing, &s;he return'd
to the River-&s;ide, where the Fairy kept her word:
and throwing &s;ome Water in <HI>Plou&s;ina's</HI> Face, ren|der'd
her as beautiful as &s;he wi&s;h'd to be.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Effect of the fortunate <HI>Plou&s;ina's</HI> Charms,
was the Prai&s;es of &s;ome Sea-Gods that accompanied
the Fairy; &s;he &s;aw her&s;elf in the Water, and knew
not her&s;elf, her Silence and Amazement being then
the only Marks of her Acknowledgment. &startq;I have
fulfilled all your De&s;ires, <HI>&s;aid the generous Fairy to
her;</HI> you ought to be &s;atisfied, but I &s;hall not, till
I have exceeded your De&s;ires by my Bounty.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I give you, with Wit and Beauty, all the Trea|&s;ures
in my di&s;po&s;al, which are inexhau&s;tible;
wi&s;h only for what Riches you would have, and
<PB N="128" REF="137">
you &s;hall that minute obtain them both for your|&s;elf,
and whoever you think fit.&endq;</P>
<P>The Fairy afterwards di&s;appear'd, and the young
<HI>Plou&s;ina,</HI> who was then as hand&s;ome as <HI>Hebe,</HI> re|turn'd
to the Palace: All that met her were
charm'd, they told the King of her Arrival, who
admired her him&s;elf, but knew her by her Voice
and Wit; &s;he inform'd him, that a Fairy had be|&s;tow'd
tho&s;e invaluable Gifts on her, and that &s;he
would be call'd <HI>Hebe,</HI> becau&s;e &s;he perfectly re&s;em|bled
the Picture of that Godde&s;s.</P>
<P>What new Grounds of Hatred were here for her
Si&s;ters! her Wit gave them le&s;s Jealou&s;y than her
Beauty now.</P>
<P>All the Princes, who had been captivated by
their Charms, no longer balanced to become un|faithful;
they for&s;ook all the Beauties of that Court,
no Tears nor Reproaches could &s;tay tho&s;e fickle
Lovers: and this Proceeding, which at that time
appear'd &s;o &s;urprizing, hath &s;ince, they &s;ay, become
common. In &s;hort, they all burnt for <HI>Hebe,</HI> who&s;e
Heart remain'd in&s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the Hatred of her Si&s;ters, &s;he
neglected nothing that might plea&s;e them; &s;he
wi&s;h'd for &s;o much Trea&s;ure for the Elde&s;t, (for to
wi&s;h and give was with her the &s;ame) that the
greate&s;t Monarch of that Country ask'd that Prin|ce&s;s
in Marriage, and the Wedding was con&s;umma|ted
with great Magnificence.</P>
<P>The King, <HI>Hebe's</HI> Father, being inclin'd to rai&s;e a
great Army, the Wi&s;hes of that fair Prince&s;s crown|ed
all his Enterprizes with Succe&s;s; his Kingdom
and Trea&s;ury became thereby very much enrich'd,
which render'd him a mo&s;t formidable Prince.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s the Divine <HI>Hebe,</HI> wearied with the
Hurry of a Court, went to &s;pend &s;ome Months in a
pretty Box, &s;ome di&s;tance from the capital Town,
where &s;he laid a&s;ide all Magnificence, contenting
her&s;elf with what was gallant, and of a charming
<PB N="129" REF="138">
Plainne&s;s; Nature there only embeli&s;h'd the Walks,
&s;ince Art was not then u&s;ed.</P>
<P>A Wood &s;urrounded this pretty Retreat, the Paths
of which had &s;omething wild in them, divided by
Brooks and little Rivulets, which formed natural
Ca&s;cades.</P>
<P>The young <HI>Hebe,</HI> walking often in this &s;olitary
Wood, one day felt a &s;ecret Grief and Langui&s;h|ing,
which never for&s;ook her; &s;he was ignorant of
the Cau&s;e of it, and &s;at her&s;elf down on the Grafs
by the Brook-&s;ide, the purling Noi&s;e of which en|tertain'd
her Thoughts.</P>
<P>&startq;What Chagrin, <HI>&s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf,</HI> di&s;turbs the Ex|ce&s;s
of my Good-fortune? What Prince&s;s in the
World enjoys &s;o perfect an Happine&s;s as my&s;elf?
I have, by the Fairy's Bounty, all I wi&s;h'd for; I
can load all about me with Riches; all that &s;ee
me adore me, and yet my Heart po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es not quiet
Thoughts: I cannot imagine whence proceeds the
in&s;upportable Di&s;quiet, which hath for &s;ome time
oppo&s;ed the Felicity of my Life.&endq;</P>
<P>Thus the young Prince&s;s continually reflected,
till at length &s;he re&s;olved to go to the River, to
endeavour to &s;ee <HI>Anguilletta.</HI></P>
<P>The Fairy, accu&s;tomed to flatter her De&s;ires, ap|pear'd
on the Water, for it was one of tho&s;e Days
when &s;he was metamorpho&s;ed into a Fi&s;h.</P>
<P>&startq;I behold you always with plea&s;ure, young Prin|ce&s;s,
<HI>&s;aid &s;he to</HI> Hebe; I know you are come from
a very &s;olitary Abode, and you appear to me lan|gui&s;hing,
which is no ways agreeable with your
Fortune. What ails you, <HI>Hebe?</HI> tell me.&endq; &startq;I ail
nothing, <HI>reply'd the young Prince&s;s in Confu&s;ion;</HI> you
have heap$d too many Favours on me, to want any
thing to compleat the Happine&s;s which you have
be&s;tow'd upon me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You fain would deceive me, <HI>an&s;wer'd the Fairy;</HI>
I know very well you are not content, but what
can you de&s;ire more? Merit my Bounty by a &s;in|cere
Confe&s;&s;ion, and I promi&s;e to accompli&s;h your
<PB N="130" REF="139">
De&s;ires. &startq;I know not what I would have, <HI>&s;aid
the charming</HI> Hebe; yet I am &s;en&s;ible, <HI>continued &s;he,
lo$ring her Eyes,</HI> I want &s;omething that is ab&s;olute|ly
nece&s;&s;ary to compleat my Happine&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Oh! <HI>cry'd the Fairy,</HI> 'tis Love you de&s;ire; that
Pa&s;&s;ion only is capable of making you think &s;o
fanta&s;tically as you do.</P>
<P>&startq;A daugerous di&s;po&s;ition! <HI>continued the prudent Fai|ry;</HI>
you want Love, you &s;hall have it, Hearts are
naturally but too much di&s;po&s;ed to it: but let me
tell you, you will call on me in vain, to put an end
to that fatal Pa&s;&s;ion you think &s;o great an Happi|ne&s;s,
my Power extending not &s;o far.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That matters no$, <HI>reply'd the young Prince&s;s ha&s;tily,
blu&s;hing and &s;miling at the &s;ame time:</HI> Alas! what
&s;hould I do with all the Riches you have given
me, if I, in my turn, might not contribute to ano|ther's
Felicity?&endq; At this Di&s;cour&s;e the Fairy &s;igh'd,
and &s;hrunk beneath the Water.</P>
<P><HI>Hebe</HI> return'd to her Solitude, with hopes that al|ready
began to calm her Troubles; the Fairy's Me|naces
&s;omewhat di&s;turbed her, but tho&s;e wi&s;e Re|flections
were &s;oon cha&s;ed away by others more
dangerous, but much more delightful.</P>
<P>When &s;he came to her little Box, &s;he found a
Me&s;&s;enger from the King, who &s;ent for her to come
to Court the next day; the King and Queen re|ceived
her with plea&s;ure, and told her, that a
&s;trange Prince in his Travels arriving at their Court,
they had a mind to make an Entertainment for
him, to &s;hew other Courts the Magnificence of
theirs.</P>
<P>The young <HI>Hebe,</HI> in a Trouble &s;he could not ac|count
for, ask'd her Si&s;ter at fir&s;t if the Stranger
was hand&s;ome: &startq;You never &s;aw any thing like
him,&endq; <HI>an&s;wer'd the Prince&s;s.</HI> &startq;De&s;cribe him to me,&endq;
&startq;<HI>reply'd</HI> Hebe <HI>in di&s;order.</HI> &startq;He is &s;uch as they feign
Heroes to be, <HI>an&s;wer'd</HI> Ileria; his Shape is fine,
his Air noble, his Eyes full of Fire, which the
Power of one of the mo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible Ladies of the
<PB N="131" REF="140">
Court hath already confe&s;&s;ed; he has a very fine
Head of brown Hair, and needs but &s;hew him&s;elf
to gain the Attention of all that &s;ee him.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You &s;et him off to the be&s;t advantage, <HI>reply'd
Hebe;</HI> do not you flatter him?&endq; &startq;No, Si&s;ter, <HI>an|&s;wer'd
the Prince&s;s</HI> Ileria, <HI>with a Sigh &s;he could not re|tain:</HI>
alas! you will find him but too worthy of
plea&s;ing.&endq;</P>
<P>At night the Prince paid the Queen a Vi&s;it, who
pre&s;ented him to <HI>Hebe,</HI> whom he had not &s;een; but
never were two Hearts &s;o &s;oon, or &s;o &s;en&s;ibly touch'd,
or ever had more rea&s;on.</P>
<P>The Conver&s;ation was on indifferent Subjects, but
bright and agreeable, and &s;upported by all that Vi|vacity
the De&s;ire of plea&s;ing could in&s;pire.</P>
<P>When the Queen retired, and the fair <HI>Hebe</HI> had

what an Object have you permitted me to behold?
Your &s;age Coun&s;els are de&s;troy'd by his Pre&s;ence.
Why gave you me not Strength to re&s;i&s;t &s;uch
Charms? But perhaps their Power exceeds that
of a Fairy.&endq; <HI>Hebe</HI> &s;lept but little that night, &s;he
ro&s;e very early, and the Care of dre&s;&s;ing her again&s;t
the Entertainment at night, amazed her all that
day with an Attention &s;he was ignorant of till then;
&s;he being willing to plea&s;e, for the fir&s;t time, the
young Stranger, who&s;e De&s;ires were the &s;ame, for|got
nothing that might render him amiable in the
charming <HI>Hebe's</HI> Eyes. The Prince&s;s <HI>Ileria,</HI> on her
part, neglected nothing that might plea&s;e; &s;he was
Mi&s;tre&s;s of a thou&s;and Beauties, and when <HI>Hebe</HI>
was ab&s;ent, appear'd the mo&s;t charming Per&s;on in
the whole World; but that Prince&s;s a Pre&s;ence ef|faced
them all.</P>
<P>At night there was a noble Entertainment, fol|low'd
by a fine Ball, and the young Stranger had
without di&s;pute taken notice of the Magnificence,
could he have regarded any thing but the beautiful
$word$.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="141">
After the Repa&s;t, there was a fine Illumination,
which gave as great a light in the Gardens of the
Palace, as if it had been Day. They went to
take a plea&s;ant Walk. The lovely Stranger gave
the Queen his Hand, but that Honour did not make
amends for the Chagrin of being &s;eparated a mo|ment
from his Prince&s;s. The Trees were cover'd
with Fe&s;tons of Flowers, and the Lamps which
gave the light, were di&s;po&s;ed in &s;uch a manner,
as to repre&s;ent Bows and Arrows, and other Arms
of Love, and in &s;ome Places form'd Lines of Wri|ting.</P>
<P>They went into a little Wood illuminated like
the Gardens, where the Queen &s;at her&s;elf down
by an agreeable Fountain, about which, there
were placed Seats of Turfs, adorn'd with Garlands
of Pinks and Ro&s;es. While the Queen talk'd with
the King, with a great Croud of Courtiers about
them, the Prince&s;&s;es amu&s;ed them&s;elves with look|ing
at &s;ome Characters the little Lamps form'd;
the amiable Stranger &s;tanding then by the charming
<HI>Hebs,</HI> who ca&s;ting her Eyes on a Place where Ar|rows
were repre&s;ented, read aloud the&s;e Words
which were written under them,</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>They are invincible.</HEAD>
<P>&startq;Such are the Darts &s;hot from the divine <HI>Hebe's</HI>
Eyes,&endq; <HI>&s;aid the unknown Prince, looking on her tenderly.</HI>
The Prince&s;s heard him, and was confu&s;ed, but
her Embara&s;&s;ment &s;eem'd to the Prince a happy
Pre&s;age to his Love; he having ob&s;erved no An|ger.</P>
<P>When the Diver&s;ions were over, the Charms of
the Stranger had too &s;en&s;ibly touch'd the Heart of
<HI>Ileria,</HI> for her not to perceive he lov'd another.
Before <HI>Hebe's</HI> coming to Court, that Prince had
reader'd her &s;ome little Favours, but &s;ince that,
had been altogether taken up with his Tenderne&s;s
for <HI>Hebe.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="142">
In the mean time, this young Stranger endea|vour'd
by his Love to move the Heart of the
beautiful Prince&s;s; he was in love, amiable, and
his Fate oblig'd him to love, and the Fairy aban|doning
her to the Inclination of her Heart, what
Excu&s;es were there for her to yield, who could
not long hold out again&s;t her&s;elf.</P>
<P>The charming Stranger told her he was a King's
Son, and was call'd <HI>Atimir;</HI> who&s;e Name was well
known to the Prince&s;s; for that Prince had done
Wonders, in a War between the two Kingdoms,
and as they had always been Enemies, he went
not by his true Name at her Father's Court.</P>
<P>The young Prince&s;s, after a Conver&s;ation,
wherein her Heart had fully receiv'd the &s;weet and
dangerous Poi&s;on the Fairy had &s;poke to her of,
permitted <HI>Atimir</HI> to di&s;cover to the King his Rank
and Love; who, tran&s;ported with Joy, ran to the
King, and &s;poke to him with all the Ardour his
Tenderne&s;s could in&s;pire.</P>
<P>The King conducted him to the Queen. Before
this Marriage, a la&s;ting Peace was made, and the
beautiful <HI>Hebe</HI> was promi&s;ed to her happy Lover,
as &s;oon as he had receiv'd his Father's Con&s;ent.
This News being &s;pread abroad, the Prince&s;s
<HI>Ileria</HI> felt a Grief equal to her Jealou&s;y; &s;he cry'd
and groan'd, but was forc'd to con&s;train her&s;elf,
and conceal her u&s;ele&s;s Grief.</P>
<P>The charming <HI>Hebe</HI> and <HI>Atimir</HI> &s;eeing one another
every day, their Tenderne&s;s augmented, and, at
that happy time, the Prince&s;s could not compre|hend,
why the Fairies, when they would compleat
the Happine&s;s of Mortals, &s;hould not u&s;e all their
Art and Knowledge to make them love.</P>
<P>An Amba&s;&s;ador from <HI>Atimir's</HI> Father arrived at
Court, who had been expected with great Impa|tience,
and brought with him his Con&s;ent; every
thing was prepared for the Marriage, and <HI>Atimir</HI>
had nothing to fear: a dangerous State for a Lover
one would pre&s;erve faithful!</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="143">
The Prince thus a&s;&s;ured of his Happine&s;s, became
&s;omewhat le&s;s &s;en&s;ible; one day as he was looking
for <HI>Hebe</HI> in the Gardens of the Palace, he heard the
Voices of &s;ome Women in a Summer-Box of
Honey &s;uckles and hearing his Name mention'd,
which excited his Curio&s;ity to know more, he
drew nigh to them, and heard the Prince&s;s <HI>Ileria</HI>
&s;ay to a Per&s;on that was with her, &startq;I &s;hall die
before that fatal day, my dear <HI>Cleonice:</HI> the Gods
will not permit me to &s;ee the ungrateful Man
whom I love, united to the too happy <HI>Hebe:</HI> My
Torments are too grievous for my Life to endure
much longer.&endq; &startq;But, Madam, <HI>an&s;wered the Dam|&s;el,</HI>
the Prince <HI>Atimir</HI> is not unfaithful, he never
made you any Vows, Fate alone is the Cau&s;e of
your Misfortunes, and, among &s;o many Princes
that adore you, you may find more amiable than
him, if a fatal Prevention po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es not your
Heart.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Is there any in the whole World &s;o lovely as
him? <HI>reply'd</HI> Ileria. Powerful Fairy! <HI>added &s;he with
a Sigh,</HI> of all the Favours you have be&s;tow'd on
the fortunate <HI>Hebe,</HI> I only envy <HI>Atimir's</HI> Love.&endq;</P>
<P>This Di&s;cour&s;e of the Prince&s;s's was interrupted
by her Tears. Alas! how happy had &s;he been,
had &s;he known how much &s;he touch'd the Heart of
<HI>Atimir?</HI></P>
<P>She &s;tarted up to go out of the Box, and the
Prince hid him&s;elf behind &s;ome Trees. The Tears
and Pa&s;&s;ion of <HI>Ileria</HI> had &s;oftened his Heart, which
he look'd upon then, only as Compa&s;&s;ion, in favour
of a beautiful Prince&s;s, whom he, again&s;t his Will,
had made unhappy. Afterwards he went and found
<HI>Hebe,</HI> who&s;e Charms &s;u&s;pended all other Thoughts
at that time.</P>
<P>In cro&s;&s;ing the Gardens to return to the Palace,
he found &s;omething under his feet, which he took
up, and found it to be a fine Pocket-Book. It
was not far off the Box where he heard the Con|ver&s;ation
of <HI>Ileria,</HI> therefore he fear'd to &s;hew the
<PB N="135" REF="144">
Pocket-Book, le&s;t he &s;hould give <HI>Hebe</HI> any Know|ledge
of that Adventure; but hid it from that
Prince&s;s, who was then employ'd in doing &s;ome|thing
to her Head-dre&s;s.</P>
<P>That Night <HI>Ileria</HI> went not to the Queen, who
was told &s;he was not very well after walking;
and <HI>Atimir</HI> comprehended that &s;he had a mind
to conceal the Di&s;order he had &s;een her in at
the Box, which Thought&punc; redoubled his Compa&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he got to his Apartment, he open'd
the Pocket-Book he had found, and on the fir&s;t
Leaf found a Cypher of a double <HI>A,</HI> crown'd
with Myrrh, and &s;upported by two Loves, one of
which &s;eem'd to wipe his Eyes, and the other to
break his Arrows.</P>
<P>The Sight of this Cypher moved the young
Prince, he knew very well what <HI>Ileria</HI> meant,
turn'd over the next Leaf to know more, and
found the&s;e Words writ on the back&s;ide:
<Q><L>Almighty Love, your Charms di&s;play'd,</L>
<L>Which did my ea&s;y Heart invade:</L>
<L>Ah Cruel! thus your Power to prove,</L>
<L>And ble&s;s another with your Love.</L></Q></P>
<P>The Hand, which he knew very well, inform'd
him it was the Prince&s;s <HI>Ileria's</HI> Book, he was
touch'd with tho&s;e tender Sentiments, which, far
from being &s;upported by his Love and Care, were
not &s;o much as &s;upported by Hope. The&s;e Ver&s;es
put him in mind, that before <HI>Hebe's</HI> Arrival at the
Court, he thought <HI>Ileria</HI> amiable; he began to
look upon him&s;elf as fal&s;e to that Prince&s;s, and
indeed became too much &s;o to the charming
<HI>Hebe.</HI></P>
<P>However, he oppo&s;ed the fir&s;t Emotions, but his
Heart was u&s;ed to be fickle, and we &s;eldom are
capable of breaking our&s;elves of an ill Habit.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="145">
He threw <HI>Ileria's</HI> Pocket-Book upon the Table,
re&s;olved never to look into it, but took it up a|gain
in &s;pite of him&s;elf, a moment afterwards, and
found in it a thou&s;and things which compleated
<HI>Ileria's</HI> Triumph over the Divine <HI>Hebe.</HI></P>
<P>A thou&s;and confu&s;ed Thoughts po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the
Prince's Heart all night: In the morning he waited
on the King, who appointed the day of his Mar|riage
with <HI>Hebe. Atimir</HI> an&s;wered with a Confu|&s;ion,
which the King took for a Mark of his Love.
How hard is it to know the Hearts of Men, &s;ince
what Confu&s;ion was the Effect of his Infidelity!</P>
<P>The King was going to the Queen, and the
Prince was obliged to follow him. He had not
been there long, when the Prince&s;s <HI>Ileria</HI> appear|ing
with a langui&s;hing Look, which the uncon&s;tant
<HI>Atimir</HI> knowing too well the Cau&s;e of, rendered
her more lovely in his Eyes; he made up to her,
talk'd to her a long while, and inform'd her he
was not ignorant of her Sentiments for him, and
afterwards explain'd him&s;elf to her with a Tender|ne&s;s,
which was an Happine&s;s too great, and but
little expected by <HI>Ileria.</HI></P>
<P>The charming <HI>Hebe</HI> came in at the &s;ame time;
the Sight of her made the Prince&s;s <HI>Ileria</HI> and the
light <HI>Atimir</HI> blu&s;h. &startq;How hand&s;ome &s;he is! <HI>&s;aid</HI>
&startq;Ileria, <HI>looking on the Prince with an Emotion &s;he could
not conceal.</HI> Fly hence, Sir, or deprive me quite
of Life.&endq; To which the Prince could make no
an&s;wer. When <HI>Hebe</HI> approached with an Air and
Charms, which ca&s;t a thou&s;and Reproaches on the
ungrateful <HI>Atimir,</HI> all which he could not &s;upport&punc;
He left the Prince&s;s, and told her he was going
to di&s;patch a Courier to the King his Father; and
&s;he for her part, being prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd in his favour,
ob&s;erved not tho&s;e Looks he &s;ometimes ca&s;t $word$
<HI>Ileria.</HI></P>
<P>While <HI>Ileria</HI> triumph'd &s;ecretly, the fair <HI>Hebe</HI> was
told by the King and Queen, &s;he was to be mar|ried
to <HI>Atimir</HI> in three days. But how unworthy
<PB N="137" REF="146">
was he then of the Sentiments that News created
in the Heart of the lovely <HI>Hebe?</HI></P>
<P>The Prince, tho po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with a fal&s;e Pa&s;&s;ion,
&s;pent part of the day with <HI>Hebe;</HI> and <HI>Ileria,</HI> who
knew of it, thought &s;he &s;hould have dy'd a thou|&s;and
times for Jealou&s;y; her Love redoubling when|ever
&s;he had any the lea&s;t Hope.</P>
<P>As the Prince was going into his Apartment
at night, he receiv'd a Letter from an unknown
Man, which he open'd in ha&s;te, and found the&s;e
Words in it.</P>
<P>&startq;I yield to a Pa&s;&s;ion a thou&s;and times more &s;trong
than my Rea&s;on, but &s;ince it is in vain to con|ceal
tho&s;e Sentiments from you, which Chance
hath di&s;cover'd; come, Prince, and know the
Re&s;olution my tender Love hath made me take.
How happy &s;hould I be, if it co&s;t me but my
Life!&endq;</P>
<P>The Per&s;on that brought this Letter told him,
he was ordered to conduct him where the Prin|ce&s;s
<HI>Ileria</HI> waited for him. <HI>Atimir,</HI> without con|&s;idering
a moment, follow'd him. After a great
many Turnings and Windings, they came to a
&s;mall Pavilion full of Lights, which was at the
end of a clo&s;e &s;haded Alley; where he found
<HI>Ileria</HI> with only one of her Women, the re&s;t being
gone to walk in the Garden.</P>
<P><HI>Ileria</HI> was &s;at on a crim&s;on Cu&s;hion embroider'd
with Gold; her Dre&s;s, which was both gallant and
magnificent, was yellow and &s;ilver Ti&s;&s;ue; her
fine black Hair was dre&s;s'd with Ribbons of the
&s;ame Colour as her Clothes, intermix'd with Dia|monds.
At the &s;ight of her, <HI>Atimir</HI> a&s;hamed of
being fal&s;e, fell on his Knees by her, and <HI>Ileria</HI>
looking on him with a Tenderne&s;s that &s;ufficiently
betray'd the Sentiments of her Heart, &s;aid, &startq;Prince,
I &s;ent for you not to per&s;uade you to break off
your Marriage, I know too well 'tis re&s;olved
<PB N="138" REF="147">
on: but &s;ince &s;ome words which you was plea&s;ed
to flatter my Misfortune and Tenderne&s;s with, do
not permit me to believe you will leave <HI>Hebe</HI> for
me;&endq; yet, <HI>continu'd &s;he with Tears, that entirely &s;edu|ced
&startq;the Heart of</HI> Atimir, I will &s;acrifice to my Love
without regret a Life you have render'd &s;o pain|ful

Box &s;he held in her Hand,</HI> &s;hall &s;ecure me from the

<P>&startq;No, beautiful <HI>Ileria, cry'd the fickle Prince,</HI> I will
not be hers, I will leave her to plea&s;e you, whom
I love a thou&s;and times better; and notwith&s;tand|ing
my Duty and Faith &s;o &s;olemnly given, I am

ador'd by the Man I love.&endq;</P>
<P>After the&s;e words they con&s;ulted Mea&s;ures for
their Departure, and having no Time to lo&s;e, they
re&s;olved on the Night following. They parted with
a great deal of Reluctancy: and notwith&s;tanding
<HI>Atimir's</HI> Oaths, <HI>Ileria</HI> yet dreaded <HI>Hebe's</HI> Charms;
and was the remainder of the Night, and the Day
following, continually po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with that Fear.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Prince gave all nece&s;&s;ary
Orders for their &s;ecret Departure; and the next
Night, when every body was retired in the Palace,
went to <HI>Ileria's</HI> Pavillion in the Garden, where &s;he
waited for him, attended only by <HI>Cleonice.</HI> They
went away, and with incredible Speed got out of
the Kingdom. In the Morning this News was
made known by a Letter <HI>Ileria</HI> writ to the Queen,
and one writ by <HI>Atimir</HI> to the King; which were
<PB N="139" REF="148">
very moving, and ea&s;ily di&s;cover'd that Love was
the Dictator. The King and Queen were in an
extreme Rage; but Words are not capable to ex|pre&s;s
the piercing Griefs of the unfortunate and
charming <HI>Hebe:</HI> How great was her De&s;pair, and
how many her Tears! What Vows did &s;he not of|fer
to the Fairy <HI>Anguilletta,</HI> to put an end to tho&s;e
cruel Calamities &s;he had foretold! <HI>Hebe</HI> return'd
in vain to the River-&s;ide; <HI>Anguilletta,</HI> who was as
good as her word, never appear'd, but abandon'd
her to the mo&s;t frightful De&s;pair. The Princes,
whom the ungrateful <HI>Atimir's</HI> good Fortune had
di&s;carded, took fre&s;h Hopes, and their Cares and
Love &s;eem'd new Torments to the faithful <HI>Hebe.</HI></P>
<P>The King de&s;ired her pa&s;&s;ionately to make choice
of a Spou&s;e, and oftentimes pre&s;s'd her to it; but
this Duty appear'd too cruel to her Tenderne&s;s, &s;he
re&s;olv'd to leave her Father's Kingdom, but before
her Departure went once again to find <HI>Anguilletta.</HI></P>
<P>The Fairy, who this time could not re&s;i&s;t the
Tears of the beautiful <HI>Hebe,</HI> appear'd; at the &s;ight
of her the Prince&s;s renew'd her Tears, having no
power to &s;peak to her: &startq;You know now, <HI>&s;aid the
Fairy,</HI> what that fatal Happine&s;s is, which I was
always willing to refu&s;e you; but <HI>Hebe, Atimir</HI> has
puni&s;h'd you but too well for not following my
Advice: Go and avoid this place, which calls into
your remembrance all your Tenderne&s;s; you will
find a Ve&s;&s;el by the Sea-&s;ide that will carry you to
the only Place in the World, where you may be
cured of this unhappy Pa&s;&s;ion that cau&s;es your
De&s;pair; but remember, <HI>added</HI> Anguilletta, <HI>rai&s;ing
her Voice,</HI> that when your Heart is ea&s;y and quiet,
you never &s;eek after the fatal Pre&s;ence of <HI>Atimir,</HI>
which will co&s;t you your Life.&endq; <HI>Hebe</HI> wi&s;h'd more
than once to &s;ee that Prince once again, whatever
that Plea&s;ure &s;hould co&s;t her; but &s;ome Remains of
Rea&s;on, and Value of her Honour, made her re&s;olve
to accept of the Fairy's Propo&s;al. She thank'd her
for this la&s;t Kindne&s;s, and went the next day to
<PB N="140" REF="149">
the Sea-&s;ide, attended by tho&s;e Women &s;he had the
greate&s;t Confidence in.</P>
<P>There &s;he found <HI>Anguilletta's</HI> Ve&s;&s;el, all gilt with
Gold, the Ma&s;ts of inlaid Work, the Sails of Silver
and Ro&s;e-colour'd Ti&s;&s;ue, on which were writ <HI>Li|berty.</HI>
The Sailors Jackets were of the &s;ame Colour
as the Sails, and every thing &s;eem'd to breathe the
Sweets of Liberty.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s went into a magnificent Cabin, the
Furniture of which was admirable, and the Paint|ings
perfectly fine. She &s;till afflicted her&s;elf as
much in this new Abode as in her Father's Court;
they endeavour'd to divert her by a thou&s;and Plea|&s;ures,
but the State &s;he was in would not permit
her to give any Attention to them.</P>
<P>One day as &s;he was amu&s;ing her&s;elf in looking
on &s;ome Paintings in the Cabin, in a place that re|pre&s;ented
a Landskip, &s;he ob&s;erv'd a young Shep|herde&s;s
with a &s;miling Air cutting of Nets, to &s;et
&s;ome Birds at liberty that were taken; and &s;ome
of tho&s;e little Creatures that were e&s;cap'd, &s;eem'd
to fly towards Heaven with a wonderful Swiftne&s;s.
The other Paintings &s;eem'd to repre&s;ent &s;uch like
Subjects, nothing &s;eem'd to &s;peak of Love, but all
boa&s;ted of the Charms of Liberty; which made the
Prince&s;s in a melancholy Tone &s;ay, &startq;Will my Heart
be always in&s;en&s;ible for &s;o &s;weet an Happine&s;s,
for which my Rea&s;on makes &s;uch vain Efforts?</P>
<P>Thus the unhappy <HI>Hebe</HI> lived po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with her
Tenderne&s;s, and at the &s;ame time with the de&s;ire
of forgetting it.</P>
<P>They had been about a Month at Sea, when one
Morning as the Prince&s;s was upon Deck, &s;he di&s;|cern'd
at a di&s;tance a Coa&s;t that &s;eem'd very plea|&s;ant;
the Trees were of a &s;urprizing Height and
Beauty, and when they were nearer &s;he ob&s;erved
they were full of Birds, the Plumage of which was
of a bright &s;hining Colour; they made a charming
Concert, their Songs being &s;o &s;weet, that they
&s;eem'd as if they fear'd to make too great a noi&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="150">
When they arriv'd at this Shore, the Prince&s;s and
her Women landed, where &s;he no &s;ooner breathed
the Air of that I&s;land, but &s;he felt a perfect Tran|quillity
in her Brea&s;t, and &s;uffer'd her&s;elf to be
&s;urprized by an agreeable Sleep, which clo&s;ed her
Eyes for &s;ome time.</P>

thou&s;and Years with the happy Gift of curing the
mo&s;t unfortunate Pa&s;&s;ions, and a&s;&s;ured them that
Gift &s;hould &s;till continue; but the difficulty was to

<P>While the beautiful <HI>Hebe</HI> enjoy'd a Repo&s;e &s;he
had not ta&s;ted the Sweets of for &s;ix Months before,
the Prince of the <HI>peaceable I&s;land</HI> was taking the Air
in that Wood which bordered by the Sea-&s;ide, in
his Chariot, drawn by four white young Elephants,
and attended by his Court.</P>
<P>There he &s;aw the Prince&s;s a&s;leep; her Beauty
&s;urprized him. He alighted out of his Chariot with
a Precipitation and Vivacity he never felt till then.
He took at that &s;ight all the Love the Charms of
<HI>Hebe</HI> were worthy of in&s;piring. The noi&s;e awa|ken'd
her, and &s;he opening her Eyes, di&s;cover'd a
thou&s;and new Beauties to the young Prince. He
was about the &s;ame Age of <HI>Hebe,</HI> which was nine|teen:
his Beauty was perfect; a thou&s;and Graces
were in all his Actions; his Shape extraordinary;
and his Hair, which hung in large Rings down to
the middle of his Back, was of the &s;ame Colour as
<HI>Hebe's.</HI> His Habit was made of Feathers of a thou|&s;and
different Colours; he had over it a kind of
Cloke, that trailed on the Ground, made of Swans
Feathers, buckled on the Shoulders by very fine
Diamonds. His Belt was all of Diamonds, on which
hung by Chains of Gold a &s;mall Sabre cover'd over
with Rubies. He had a kind of Headpiece, made
of Feathers like the re&s;t, on which was button'd by
<PB N="142" REF="151">
a very large Diamond &s;ome Herons Feathers, which
&s;et it off with greater Splendor.</P>
<P>This Prince was the fir&s;t Object that pre&s;ented it
&s;elf to the young Prince&s;s when &s;he awaken'd. He
appear'd to her worthy of her Regard, and it was
the fir&s;t time in all her Life that ever &s;he look'd
on any other but <HI>Atimir</HI> with any Attention.</P>
<P>&startq;Every thing a&s;&s;ures me, <HI>&s;aid the Prince of the
peaceable I&s;land to the Prince&s;s,</HI> that you are the Di|vine
<HI>Hebe:</HI> Alas! who be&s;ides could boa&s;t &s;o many
Charms?&endq; Who could, Sir, &s;o &s;oon inform you,
&startq;<HI>an&s;wer'd the young Prince&s;s, getting up and blu&s;hing at
the &s;ame time,</HI> that I was in this I&s;land?&endq; &startq;A pow|erful
Fairy, <HI>reply'd the young King,</HI> who, willing to
make me the happie&s;t of Men, and this Country
mo&s;t fortunate, promi&s;ed me to conduct you here,
and hath permitted me yet more glorious Hopes.&endq;
&startq;But I am very &s;en&s;ible, <HI>added he &s;ighing,</HI> that my
Fate depends more on your Bounty than hers.&endq;
After the&s;e words, to which &s;he an&s;wer'd with a
great deal of Wit, the Prince de&s;ired her to go in|to
his Chariot, which &s;hould carry her to the Pa|lace,
and out of Re&s;pect went not into it him&s;elf:
but as &s;he under&s;tood by his Di&s;cour&s;e, and by his
Train, that he was the King of that I&s;le, &s;he obli|ged
him to &s;it by her.</P>
<P>Never any thing appear'd &s;o beautiful in one
Chariot; all the Prince's Court at that &s;ight could
not forbear their Applau&s;es. While they were on
the way, the young Prince entertain'd <HI>Hebe</HI> with a
great deal of Wit and Tenderne&s;s; and the Prin|ce&s;s,
&s;atisfied to find her Heart at ea&s;e, re&s;umed all
her Vivacity.</P>
<P>They arriv'd at the Palace, which was &s;ome di|&s;tance
from the Sea, and built all of Ivory, and
cover'd with Agate, all the Avenues to which were
encompa&s;&s;ed with fine Canals.</P>
<P>The Prince's Guards were drawn out in all the
Courts; in the fir&s;t they were clothed in yellow
Feathers, with Head-pieces, Bows and Arrows, all
<PB N="143" REF="152">
of Silver; in the &s;econd they were clothed in Fea|thers
of a Fire-colour, with gilt Sabres, adorn'd
with Turquoi&s;es. When they came into the third
Court, the Guards were clothed in white Feathers,
holding in their Hands gilded and painted Half|pikes,
adorn'd with Garlands of Flowers, for in that
Country they never were in War, therefore bore
no terrible Arms.</P>
<P>The Prince alighted out of his Chariot, and led
the amiable <HI>Hebe</HI> into a magnificent Apartment.
The Court was numerous, the Ladies beautiful,
the Men gallant and hand&s;ome: and tho all the In|habitants
of the Country were clothed with Fea|thers,
the Art of forming them in Shades made them
very agreeable.</P>
<P>That night the Prince of the peaceable I&s;land
made a great Entertainment for the beautiful <HI>Hebe,</HI>
which was follow'd by a Concert of &s;weet Flutes,
Lutes, Theorboes and Harp&s;icords; for in that
Country they lov'd not noi&s;y In&s;truments: the Sym|phony
was very fine, and when it had la&s;ted &s;ome
time, a delicate fine Voice &s;ung &s;ome Words which
declared the Prince's Pa&s;&s;ion, while he gaz'd on
<HI>Hebe,</HI> to per&s;uade her tho&s;e Words expre&s;s'd his
Thoughts.</P>
<P>As it was late when the Mu&s;ick left off, the
Prince led the Prince&s;s into the Apartment ap|pointed
for her, which was the fine&s;t in the Palace;
there &s;he found a great Number of Ladies, whom
the Prince had named to have the honour to be her
Attendants.</P>
<P>The Prince left the beautiful <HI>Hebe,</HI> the mo&s;t in
love of all Men. They put her to Bed; the Ladies
retired, and only left in the Chamber tho&s;e &s;he
brought along with her. &startq;Who could believe it,
<HI>&s;aid &s;he to them when &s;he was at liberty,</HI> my Heart is
at peace! What God hath calm'd my Troubles?
I love <HI>Atimir</HI> no longer; I can think without dy|ing
with Grief, that he is, perhaps, <HI>Ileria's</HI> Spou&s;e.
Is not all I &s;ee a Dream? No, <HI>&s;aid &s;he, recovering
<PB N="144" REF="153">
her&s;elf a little,</HI> my Dreams u&s;ed not to be &s;o quiet.&endq;
In &s;hort, &s;he return'd <HI>Anguilletta</HI> a thou&s;and thanks,
and then went to &s;leep.</P>
<P>The next Morning when &s;he awaked, as &s;he
open'd the Bed-curtain, the Fairy appear'd to her
with a &s;miling Air, which &s;he had never ob&s;erv'd
in her Face &s;ince that fatal day &s;he ask'd for Love.
&startq;At la&s;t I have happily brought you hither, <HI>&s;aid
the amiable Fairy to her,</HI> your Heart is free, there|fore
will be content. I have cured you of a cruel
Pa&s;&s;ion. But <HI>Hebe,</HI> can I be a&s;&s;ur'd that the&s;e ter|rible
Torments, to which you have been expos'd,
will make you always avoid the &s;ight of the un|grateful
<HI>Atimir?</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>The young Prince&s;s promi&s;ed the Fairy every
thing, and &s;wore both again&s;t Love and her fal&s;e
Lover. &startq;Remember your Promi&s;es, <HI>reply'd</HI> Anguil|letta,
<HI>with an Air that left an Impre&s;&s;ion of Re&s;pect,</HI> you
will peri&s;h with <HI>Atimir</HI> if ever you &s;eek to &s;ee him
again. But every thing here ought to remove a
De&s;ire &s;o fatal to your Life.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I will no longer conceal from you what I have
re&s;olved in your favour: The Prince of this
I&s;land is my Relation, I protect his Per&s;on and
Empire: He is young and amiable, and no Prince
in the World is more worthy of being your Hu&s;|band.
Reign then, beautiful <HI>Hebe,</HI> in his Heart and
Kingdom: The King your Father gives his Con|&s;ent;
I was ye&s;terday at his Palace, and acquaint|ed
him and the Queen your Mother with the
pre&s;ent State of your Fortune, which they have
put ab&s;olutely under my Care.&endq;</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s had a great mind to have ask'd the
Fairy about <HI>Ileria</HI> and <HI>Atimir,</HI> but dur&s;t not, after &s;o
many Favours, run the hazard of di&s;plea&s;ing her;
therefore &s;he only made u&s;e of all the Wit &s;he had
be&s;tow'd on her to thank her.</P>
<P>Then &s;omebody coming into the Room the Fairy
di&s;appear'd. As &s;oon as <HI>Hebe</HI> was up, twelve Chil|dren
cloth'd like Cupids brought from the Prince
<PB N="145" REF="154">
twelve Baskets of Chry&s;tal, full of the mo&s;t agree|able
Flowers, which only garni&s;h'd &s;ome Jewels of
a wonderful beauty. In the fir&s;t Basket that was
pre&s;ented to her, this Billet was found:</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>To the Divine Hebe.</HEAD>
<P>&startq;YE&s;terday I &s;wore a thou&s;and times how I loved,
the &s;weet remembrance of which Oaths will
ever remain, &s;ince they were dictated by Love,
and are &s;upported by your Charms.&endq;</P>
<P>After what the Fairy had order'd the Prince&s;s,
&s;he comprehended that &s;he ought to accept of her
new Lover as of a Prince, who was &s;hortly to be
her Husband.</P>
<P>She received the little Loves very favourably;
and had hardly di&s;mi&s;s'd them, when four and twenty
Dwarfs, fanta&s;tically, but magnificently cloth'd,
appear'd loaded with new Pre&s;ents, that con&s;i&s;ted
of Habits all of Feathers; the Colours and Work of
which with Jewels were &s;o fine, that the Prince&s;s
own'd &s;he had never &s;een any thing &s;o gallant.</P>
<P>She made choice of a Ro&s;e-colour to wear that
day; her Head-dre&s;s was adorn'd with a Plume of
Feathers of the &s;ame Colour, and &s;he appear'd &s;o
charming with this new Ornament, that the Prince
of the <HI>peaceable I&s;land,</HI> who came to &s;ee her when
&s;he was dre&s;s'd, felt his Pa&s;&s;ion redouble. All the
Court crouded to admire the Prince&s;s. At night
the Prince propo&s;ed to the beautiful <HI>Hebe</HI> to walk
in the Gardens, which were admirable, where the
Prince told <HI>Hebe</HI> that the Fairy had fed him for four
Years with the hopes of her Arrival in the <HI>peaceable
I&s;land;</HI> &startq;But &s;ome time after, <HI>added the Prince,</HI> when
I pre&s;s'd her on her Promi&s;es, &s;he appear'd &s;ad,
and told me, the Prince&s;s is de&s;ign'd by the King
her Father for another, and not for thee: but, if
my Knowledge deceives me not, &s;he will not be
that Prince's.&endq; I will tell you more another time.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="155">
Some Months after the Fairy came again: &startq;For|tune
favours you, <HI>&s;aid &s;he to me,</HI> the Prince that
was to have been, will not be <HI>Hebe's</HI> Spou&s;e; and
in a little time you will &s;ee here the mo&s;t beauti|ful
Prince&s;s in the World.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Indeed&punc; <HI>reply'd</HI> Hebe <HI>$lu&s;hing,</HI> I was to have been
married to the Son of a neighbouring King; but
after a great many Events, the Love he bore my
Si&s;ter made him re&s;olve to go away with her.&endq;</P>
<P>The Prince of the <HI>peaceable I&s;land</HI> &s;aid a thou&s;and
tender things to the beautiful <HI>Hebe</HI> on his happy
$are, which, according with what the Fairy had
told him, had brought her into his I&s;le; and &s;he
hearken'd to him with &s;o much the more Plea&s;ure,
becau&s;e this Di&s;cour&s;e interrupted the recital of her
Adventures: &s;he fearing &s;he &s;hould not be able to
&s;peak of her faithle&s;s Lover, without di&s;covering
the Tenderne&s;s &s;he had had for him.</P>
<P>The Prince conducted <HI>Hebe</HI> into a Grotto, curi|ou&s;ly
adorn'd and embeli&s;h'd with the Spourings
of Water. The bottom of the Grotto was dark;
there was a great number of Niches with Statues,
repre&s;enting Nymphs and Shepherds, which were
hard to be di&s;tingui&s;h'd. When the Prince&s;s had
been there &s;ome time, &s;he heard a delightful Sound
of In&s;truments. A noble Illumination that appear'd
all on a &s;udden, di&s;cover'd to her, that part of tho&s;e
Statues form'd that Concert; when the others came
out, and danced fine and gallant Dances, inter|mix'd
with tender and agreeable Songs: all the
Performers in this Diver&s;ion being placed at the
botton of the Grotto, &s;urprized the Prince&s;s the
more agreeab$y.</P>
<P>After the Dance, Savages came in, and &s;erved up
a &s;tately Collation under an Arbor of Je&s;&s;amins and
Orange-flowers.</P>
<P>The Entertainment was ju&s;t over, when all on a
&s;udden the Fairy <HI>Anguilletta</HI> appear'd in the Air, in a
Chariot drawn by four Swans; and de&s;cending pro|nounced
to the Prince of the <HI>peaceable I&s;land</HI> a
<PB N="147" REF="156">
charming Happine&s;s, in telling him &s;he would have
him marry <HI>Hebe,</HI> and withal, that that Prince&s;s had
promi&s;ed her to con&s;ent.</P>
<P>The Prince, tran&s;ported with Joy, doubted at
fir&s;t to whom he &s;hould return his fir&s;t Thanks,
whether to <HI>Hebe</HI> or <HI>Anguilletta;</HI> and tho Joy permits
not of touching Expre&s;&s;ions like Grief, he acquit|ted
him&s;elf however with a great deal of Wit, and
a good Grace.</P>
<P>The Fairy had no mind to leave the Prince and
Prince&s;s till the Day appointed for their Marriage,
which was to be in three Days; when &s;he made
them both co&s;tly Pre&s;ents, and went with them,
who were follow'd by all the Court, and a great
many of the Inhabitants of the I&s;le, to the Temple
of <HI>Hymen,</HI> which was made of Olive-Branches and
Palms interlaced together, which by the Fairy's
Power never faded.</P>
<P><HI>Hymen</HI> was there, repre&s;ented by a Statue of white
Marble, crown'd with Ro&s;es, and rai&s;ed on an Al|tar
adorn'd only with Flowers, and &s;upported by a
<HI>Cupid</HI> of extraordinary Beauty, who with a &s;miling
Air pre&s;ented him with a Crown of Myrtle.</P>
<P><HI>Anguilletta,</HI> who built this Temple, was willing
every thing &s;hould be plain, to &s;hew that Love
alone can render Marriage happy. The Difficulty
is not to unite them together, but as a Miracle wor|thy
of a Fairy, to join them together for ever in the
<HI>peaceable I&s;land;</HI> which, contrary to the Cu&s;toms of
other Countries, can make Man and Wife loving
and con&s;tant.</P>
<P>In this Temple of <HI>Hymen</HI> the beautiful <HI>Hebe,</HI> led
by <HI>Anguilletta,</HI> plighted her Faith to the Prince of
the <HI>peaceable I&s;land,</HI> and receiv'd his with Plea&s;ure.
She had not that involuntary Inclination for him
that &s;he felf for <HI>Atimir;</HI> but her Heart, then exempt
from Pa&s;&s;ion, accepted of that Spou&s;e, by the Fairy's
Order, as a Prince worthy of her by his Per&s;on,
and much more by his Love. This Marriage was
<PB N="148" REF="157">
celebrated by a thou&s;and gallant Entertainments,
and <HI>Hebe</HI> liv'd happy with a Prince that ador'd her.</P>
<P>In the mean time the King, <HI>Hebe's</HI> Father, re|ceiv'd
Amba&s;&s;adors from <HI>Atimir,</HI> who ask'd leave to
marry the Prince&s;s <HI>Ileria</HI> (for his Father was dead,
and he left ab&s;olute Ma&s;ter of his Kingdom) which
was granted with Joy.</P>
<P>After this Marriage the Queen <HI>Ileria</HI> ask'd, by
new Amba&s;&s;adors, leave of the King her Father, and
Queen her Mother, to come to their Court to beg
pardon for a Fault which Love had made her com|mit,
and for which <HI>Atimir's</HI> Merit was a &s;ufficient
Excu&s;e.</P>
<P>The King con&s;ented, and <HI>Atimir</HI> and his Queen
were welcomed on their Arrival with all the De|mon&s;trations
of Joy po&s;&s;ible. A little after the beau|tiful
<HI>Hebe</HI> and her charming Spou&s;e &s;ent their Am|ba&s;&s;adors
to the King and Queen with the News of
their Nuptials, which <HI>Anguilletta</HI> had inform'd them
of before; yet notwith&s;tanding they were not re|ceiv'd
with le&s;s Plea&s;ure and Magnificence.</P>
<P><HI>Atimir</HI> was then with the King when they pre|&s;ented
them&s;elves the fir&s;t time before him; the
lovely Image of <HI>Hebe</HI> was not to be ab&s;olutely blot|ted
out of an Heart over which &s;he had &s;o great a
Sway. <HI>Atimir</HI> could not forbear &s;ighing when he
heard of the Happine&s;s of the Prince of the <HI>peace|able
I&s;land;</HI> he accu&s;ed <HI>Hebe</HI> a thou&s;and times of be|ing
uncon&s;tant, without thinking at the &s;ame time
on the Cau&s;e he had given her.</P>
<P>When the Amba&s;&s;adors of the Prince of the <HI>peace|able
I&s;land</HI> return'd crown'd with Honours, and load|ed
with Pre&s;ents, they told their Prince&s;s the great
Joy the King and Queen expre&s;s'd at their happy
Marriage.</P>
<P>But withal, (Oh! too &s;incere Relation!) they ac|quainted
<HI>Hebe</HI> that the Prince&s;s <HI>Ileria</HI> and <HI>Atimir</HI>
were at the Court. The&s;e Names, which were &s;o
dangerous to their Repo&s;e, render'd her again un|ea&s;y;
<PB N="149" REF="158">
&s;he was then happy, but Mortals cannot long
pre&s;erve a certain Felicity.</P>
<P>She was not able to re&s;i&s;t her Impatience to re|turn
to her Father's Court; which was, as &s;he &s;aid,
to &s;ee the Queen her Mother: nay, &s;he had even
per&s;uaded her&s;elf into a belief of it; for how often
do they who love deceive them&s;elves in their own
Thoughts?</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the Fairy's Threats to oblige
her to avoid the &s;ight of <HI>Atimir,</HI> &s;he propo&s;ed that
Journey to the Prince of the <HI>peaceable I&s;land,</HI> who
at fir&s;t refu&s;ed her, for <HI>Anguilletta</HI> had bid him not
let her &s;tir out of his Kingdom; but &s;he continuing
her Intreaties, and as he adored her, and knew
nothing of her Pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Atimir,</HI> he could not de|ny
one he loved &s;o well any thing.</P>
<P>He thinking to plea&s;e the beautiful <HI>Hebe</HI> by a
blind Complai&s;ance, gave Orders for their Depar|ture;
and never was there &s;een more Magnificence
than in their Equipage and in the Ships.</P>
<P>The wi&s;e <HI>Anguilletta,</HI> provoked at the little Re|gard
&s;hewn by <HI>Hebe</HI> and the Prince to her Orders,
abandon'd them to their Fate, and never appear'd
to give them Advice, which they made &s;o little
u&s;e of. For the Prince and Prince&s;s, they, after a
plea&s;ant Voyage, arrived at the Court of <HI>Hebe's</HI> Fa|ther;
where the King and Queen's Joy to &s;ee that
fine Prince&s;s again was very great. They were
charm'd with the Prince of the <HI>peaceable I&s;land,</HI> and
celebrated their Arrival by great Rejoicings through|out
the whole Kingdom; only <HI>Ileria</HI> groan'd when
&s;he heard of <HI>Hebe's</HI> Return. And it was decreed,
that when they &s;hould &s;ee one another again, no
mention &s;hould be made of what was pa&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Atimir</HI> ask'd to &s;ee <HI>Hebe,</HI> and &s;eem'd to <HI>Ileria</HI> to
de&s;ire it with too great an Ardour.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s <HI>Hebe</HI> blu&s;h'd when he came into
her Chamber; they were both in a Confu&s;ion, that
all their Wit was not &s;ufficient to extricate them
out of. The King, who was then pre&s;ent, ob&s;er|ved
<PB N="150" REF="159">
it, and joining in their Conver&s;ation, to make
this Vi&s;it the &s;horter, propo&s;ed walking in the Gar|dens
of the Palace; and as <HI>Atimir</HI> dur&s;t not offer his
Hand to <HI>Hebe,</HI> he made her only a re&s;pectful Bow,
and &s;o retired.</P>
<P>But what were the Sentiments and Idea's of his
Heart? All that lively and tender Pa&s;&s;ion he had
for <HI>Hebe,</HI> re-kindled in his Bo&s;om; he hated <HI>Ileria</HI>
and him&s;elf, and never Infidelity was attended with
more Repentance and Grief.</P>
<P>At night he waited on the Queen, to whom <HI>Hebe</HI>
was paying a Vi&s;it; and not &s;atisfied with looking
at her, endeavour'd to &s;peak to her, which &s;he al|ways
avoided; but &s;till his Eyes inform'd her too
much for her Quiet: He continu'd to &s;hew by all
his Actions, that hers had again re&s;umed their Em|pire
over him.</P>
<P><HI>Hebe's</HI> Heart was alarm'd, <HI>Atimir</HI> always appear'd
to her too lovely; &s;he re&s;olved to fly him with as
much Care as he endeavour'd to find out her: &s;he
never &s;poke to him but before the Queen, and then
never but when &s;he could not ab&s;olutely di&s;pen&s;e
with it; and was determined to per&s;uade the
Prince her Husband to return &s;oon to their own
Dominions: but how difficult a thing it is to leave
what we love!</P>
<P>One Evening as &s;he was engag'd in the&s;e Thoughts,
and had &s;hut her&s;elf up in her Clo&s;et, that &s;he
might think more at her liberty, &s;he found in her
Pocket a Billet, that had been put into it unknown
to her, which &s;he open'd, and knew to be <HI>Atimir's</HI>
hand, which gave her an inexpre&s;&s;ible Trouble; &s;he
thought not to read it, but her Heart over-ruling
her Rea&s;on, &s;he look'd it over, and found the&s;e
Words in it.</P>
<P><HI>F$ir$&s;t</HI> Hebe,
&startq;YOU are too in&s;en&s;ible of my violent Pa&s;&s;ion,
and u&s;e me with too much Indifference; but
&s;ince your Heart has, in its turn, been fal&s;e, and
<PB N="151" REF="160">
has follow'd but too clo&s;e the Example of mine,
let it imitate it in its Return. Forgive me, my
Prince&s;s, and permit me to re&s;ume tho&s;e Chains
I once wore, when we partook of each other's
Pains and Plea&s;ures.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Oh Cruel! <HI>cry'd the Princ$&s;s;</HI> what have I done,
that you &s;hould endeavour to re-kindle in my Soul
a Tenderne&s;s, that hath cau&s;ed me &s;o much Sor|row?&endq;
And then her Tears interrupted her Di&s;|cour&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>In the mean time <HI>Ileria</HI> langui&s;h'd under a Jea|lou&s;y
too ju&s;tly grounded, and <HI>Atimir,</HI> hurried on
by his Love, was unable to con&s;train him&s;elf any
longer. The Prince of the <HI>Peaceable I&s;land</HI> began to
di&s;cover his Pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Hebe,</HI> but was willing to ex|amine
farther into <HI>Atimir's</HI> Conduct, before he &s;poke
of it to the Prince&s;s, whom he adored con&s;tantly,
and whom he was afraid of informing of that
Prince's Love.</P>
<P>Some days after the Receipt of this Letter, there
were appointed Cour&s;es, when all the Princes, and
&s;prightly Youths of the Court, were to break Lances
in honour of the Ladies.</P>
<P>The King and Queen honour'd this Diver&s;ion
with their Pre&s;ence. The beautiful <HI>Hebe</HI> and the
Prince&s;s <HI>Ileria</HI> were to be&s;tow the Prizes; which
were a Sword, the Handle and Scabbard of which
were cover'd with Diamonds, and a Bracelet of
mo&s;t curious Diamonds.</P>
<P>All the Knights, named for the Cour&s;es, appear'd
with an extraordinary Magnificence, mounted on
very fine Hor&s;es, bearing the Colours their Mi|&s;tre&s;&s;es
delighted in; with Devices on their Shields,
agreeable to the Sentiments of their Hearts.</P>
<P>The Prince of the <HI>Peaceable I&s;land</HI> was in a co&s;tly
Dre&s;s, mounted on a mo&s;t beautiful dappled Hor&s;e,
with a fine, long, black Tail and Main: in all his
Equipage the Ro&s;e-colour appear'd, which <HI>Hebe</HI> ve|ry
much loved; and on his Head-piece, which was
<PB N="152" REF="161">
very light, there waved a Plume of Feathers of
the &s;ame Colour. He gain'd the Applau&s;e of all the
Spectators, and appear'd &s;o hand&s;ome in his bright
Armour, that <HI>Hebe</HI> &s;ecretly reproach'd her&s;elf a
thou&s;and times for the Sentiments &s;he had the mi&s;|fortune
to have for another. His Train was nume|rous,
cloth'd after the manner of their own Country,
very gallant and &s;tately: An E&s;quire carried his
Shield, on which was this Device; An Heart pier|ced
with an Arrow, and a <HI>Cupid</HI> &s;hooting a great
number, to endeavour to make fre&s;h Wounds; but
all, except the fir&s;t, &s;eem'd to have been drawn in
vain: the&s;e Words were underwritten;</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>I fear no other.</HEAD>
<P>The Colours and Device of the Prince of the
<HI>Peaceable I&s;land</HI> &s;oon di&s;cover'd that he was <HI>Hebe's</HI>
Knight, and that as &s;uch he would enter the Li&s;ts.
Every body was taken up with his Magnificence,
when <HI>Atimir</HI> came forward, mounted on a black
fiery Steed, that appear'd very &s;tately. His Colour
that day was a dark green, intermix'd neither with
Gold, Silver, or Jewels, only he had a Plume of
ro&s;e-colour'd Feathers on his Head-piece; and the
he affected a great Carele&s;&s;ne&s;s in his Apparel, he
had &s;o graceful a Mien, and managed his Hor&s;e &s;o
well, and withal had &s;o lofty an Air, that nobody
could forbear looking at him: On his Shield, which
he carried him&s;elf, appear'd a Love, who trampled
his Chains under his feet, and bound him&s;elf with
others more weighty, with the&s;e Words:</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Worthy only of Me.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Atimir's</HI> Train con&s;i&s;ted of the principal Lords of
his Court, who were clothed in dark Green, laced
with Silver, and cover'd over with Jewels; and
tho they were all hand&s;ome and well &s;haped, yet
it was ea&s;y to judge by that Prince's Air, he was
born to command them.</P>
<P>The different Emotions the &s;ight of this Prince
produced in the Hearts of <HI>Hebe</HI> and <HI>Ileria,</HI> and the
<PB N="153" REF="162">
Jealou&s;y the Prince of the <HI>Peaceable I&s;land</HI> conceiv'd,
when he &s;aw the Plume on <HI>Atimir's</HI> Ca&s;que of the
&s;ame Colour with his own, are not to be expre&s;s'd:
The reading of the Device compleated his Rage,
the Effects of which he then &s;tifled till a better
Opportunity.</P>
<P>The King and Queen &s;oon took notice both of
the Boldne&s;s and Imprudence of <HI>Atimir,</HI> and were
very angry, but 'twas not then a time to &s;hew it.
The Cour&s;es began with the Soundings of Trum|pets,
which rended the Air with their Echoes:
they were very fine, and all the Knights &s;hew'd
their Addre&s;s; and the Prince of the <HI>Peaceable I&s;land,</HI>
tho po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with an outrageous Jealou&s;y, &s;ignaliz'd
him&s;elf, and was proclaim'd Conqueror.</P>
<P><HI>Atimir,</HI> who knew that the fir&s;t Prize was to be
given by <HI>Ileria,</HI> never di&s;puted the Victory with the
Prince of the <HI>Peaceable I&s;land:</HI> He was declared Vic|tor
by the Judges of the Field; and advanced grace|fully,
with the Acclamations and Prai&s;es of all the
Spectators, to the Place where the King and Prin|ce&s;&s;es
&s;at to receive the Bracelet; which the Prin|ce&s;s
<HI>Ileria</HI> pre&s;ented to him, and he took with a
good Grace: then paying his Re&s;pects to the King,
Queen, and Prince&s;s, he return'd to the Li&s;ts.</P>
<P>The melancholy <HI>Ileria</HI> ob&s;erving but too well the
Di&s;dain the light <HI>Atimir</HI> &s;hew'd for the Prize &s;he
was to give, &s;igh'd grievou&s;ly; and the beautiful
<HI>Hebe</HI> felt in her Brea&s;t a &s;ecret Joy, which all her
Rea&s;on could not re&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Cour&s;e began with the &s;ame Succe&s;s as
the fir&s;t, wherein the Prince of the <HI>Peaceable I&s;land,</HI>
animated by the &s;ight of <HI>Hebe,</HI> did Wonders, and was
declar'd Victor again; when <HI>Atim$r,</HI> vex'd to be a
Spectator of his Rival's Glory, and flatter'd with the
Thought of receiving the Prize from <HI>Hebe's</HI> $and,
went and pre&s;ented him&s;elf at the end of the Li&s;ts.</P>
<P>The two Rivals look'd on each other &s;cornfully,
and that Cour&s;e between two &s;o great Princes was
celebrated by the new Trouble it cau&s;ed the two
<PB N="154" REF="163">
Prince&s;&s;es. The Princes ran one again&s;t the other
with equal advantage, and broke their Lances
without any di&s;order. The Shouts of the Specta|tors
redoubled, and they, without giving their
Hor&s;es time to breathe, return'd to take fre&s;h Lan|ces,
and ran with the &s;ame Succe&s;s and Addre&s;s as
at fir&s;t. The King, who fear'd le&s;t Fortune &s;hould
declare one of them Victors, &s;ent pre&s;ently to tell
them, that they ought to be &s;atisfied with the Glory
they had gain'd, and to de&s;ire them to put an end
to the Cour&s;es.</P>
<P>When the Per&s;on the King &s;ent came to them,
they heard him with a great deal of Impatience,
e&s;pecially <HI>Atimir;</HI> who taking upon him to &s;peak,
&s;aid. &startq;Go tell the King, I &s;hould be unworthy of
the Honour he does me, in concerning him&s;elf
with my Glory, if I &s;hould &s;uffer a Conqueror.&endq;
&startq;Let us &s;ee then, <HI>&s;aid the Prince of the</HI> Peaceable
I&s;land, <HI>&s;purring on his Hor&s;e with great Ardour,</HI> which
merits mo&s;t the King's E&s;teem, and the Favours
of Fortune.&endq;</P>
<P>The Me&s;&s;enger was not return'd to the King,
before the two Rivals, urged on by Sentiments
more prevalent than the Prize, began their Cour&s;e;
wherein Fortune favour'd the audacious <HI>Atimir,</HI> and
pronounced him Victor, the Prince of the <HI>Peaceable
I&s;land's</HI> Hor&s;e, wearied with the Cour&s;es he had
made, falling down, and throwing his Ma&s;ter on
the Sand: How great was <HI>Atimir's</HI> Joy, and that un|fortunate
Prince's Rage! He got up quickly, and
going up to his Rival before any came to them;
&startq;You have overcome me in Sports, <HI>Atimir, &s;aid he,
with an A$r &s;ufficient to &s;hew his Pa&s;&s;ion:</HI> But with
my Sword I will decide our Differences.&endq; &startq;I con|&s;ent,
<HI>reply'd the fi$ry</HI> Atimir, and will meet you to-morrow
at Sun-ri&s;e, in the Wood at the end of
the Palace-Gardens.&endq; As they had made an end
of the&s;e Words, the Judges of the Field came up to
them; whereupon they di&s;gui&s;ed their mutual
Rage, le&s;t the King &s;hould prevent their De&s;igns.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="164">
The Prince of the <HI>Peaceable I&s;land</HI> mounted his
Hor&s;e again, and rid with all &s;peed to leave the
fatal Place, where <HI>Atimir</HI> had vanqui&s;h'd him: In
the mean time that Prince went to receive the Prize
of the Cour&s;e from <HI>Hebe,</HI> who pre&s;ented it to him
with a Confu&s;ion that di&s;cover'd the different Com|motions
of her Soul; and <HI>Atimir,</HI> in taking it, commit|ted
all the Extravagancies of a Man very much in love.</P>
<P>The King and Queen, who had their Eyes fixed
on them, ob&s;erved him all the time, and return'd
to their Palace, very much di&s;&s;atisfied with the
ending of that Day. <HI>Atimir,</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with his Pa&s;|&s;ion,
went out of the Li&s;ts without any Attendants;
and <HI>Ileria,</HI> outrageous with Grief and Jealou&s;y, went
back to her Apartments.</P>
<P>Various then were the Thoughts of <HI>Hebe;</HI> &startq;I mu&s;t
go hence, <HI>&s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf,</HI> &s;ince no other Reme|dy
can be found to prevent the Misfortunes that I
fore&s;ee.&endq;</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, the King and Queen re&s;olved
to de&s;ire <HI>Atimir</HI> to go home, to avoid the new Trou|bles
his Love might create; which &s;ame Propo&s;i|tion
they likewi&s;e determined to make to the Prince
of the <HI>Peaceable I&s;land,</HI> that neither Party might take
any Umbrage thereat. But the Prince's ha&s;ty Re&s;o|lutions
prevented this prudent Fore&s;ight, for while
they deliberated on their Departure, the others
prepared for the Combat.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as <HI>Hebe</HI> came back from the Cour&s;es, &s;he
ask'd for the Prince her Spou&s;e, whom they told
her was in the Gardens of the Palace very melan|choly,
and willing to be alone. The beautiful <HI>Hebe</HI>
thought it her Duty to go and comfort him after
his Ill-fortune; &s;o without &s;taying in her Apart|ment,
&s;he went into the Gardens, follow'd by &s;ome
of her Women.</P>
<P>She was looking for the Prince, when entring
into a &s;hady Walk, &s;he e&s;py'd the amorous <HI>Atimir,</HI>
who, tran&s;ported with his Pa&s;&s;ion, and regarding
nothing el&s;e, fell on his Knees &s;ome di&s;tance from
<PB N="156" REF="165">
the Prince&s;s, and drawing the Sword he that day
received from her; &startq;Hear me, charming <HI>Hebe,
&s;aid he,</HI> or let me die at your feet.&endq;</P>
<P>The Women, frighted at this Action of the
Prince, threw them&s;elves upon him, endeavour|ing
to take away his Sword, which he turn'd with
great Rage on the other &s;ide. <HI>Hebe,</HI> the unhappy
<HI>Hebe,</HI> was for flying; but how great mu&s;t our Rea|&s;on
be, that can force us from what we love!</P>
<P>The De&s;ire of keeping this Adventure &s;ecret, with
her De&s;ign to intreat <HI>Atimir</HI> to &s;trive to cure a Pa&s;|&s;ion
&s;o fatal to them both, and the Compa&s;&s;ion &s;o
moving an Object created, all contributed to &s;tay
the Prince&s;s, who made up to the Prince; her Pre|&s;ence
&s;u&s;pended his Fury, his Sword he let fall at
her feet, and never more Trouble, Love, and Grief
appear'd at once in &s;o &s;hort a Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Words are not tender enough to expre&s;s what
tho&s;e two unhappy Lovers then endured: <HI>Hebe,</HI> un|ea&s;y
to &s;ee her&s;elf with <HI>Atimir,</HI> and &s;o nigh the
Prince of the <HI>Peaceable I&s;land,</HI> made a great Effort
on her&s;elf to leave him, charging him never to &s;ee
her more. How cruel was this Command! Had
not <HI>Atimir</HI> call'd to mind the Engagement he lay
under to fight the Prince of the <HI>Peaceable I&s;le,</HI> he
had a thou&s;and times turn'd the Sword upon him|&s;elf;
but alas! he cho&s;e rather to die, revenging
him&s;elf on his Rival.</P>
<P>The fair <HI>Hebe</HI> retired in&s;tantly to her Apartment,
the more &s;ecurely to avoid the Pre&s;ence of <HI>Atimir:</HI>
&startq;Mercile&s;s Fairy, <HI>cry'd &s;he;</HI> you only told me of
Death, if I ever &s;aw this unhappy Prince, but
now I feel Torments a thou&s;and times more griev|ous!&endq;
Then &s;he &s;ending to &s;eek for the Prince
in the Gardens and the Palace, and not finding
him, her Unea&s;ine&s;s increa&s;ed; they &s;ought him all
the night to no purpo&s;e, for he had hid him&s;elf in
a Hu$ in the mid&s;t of the Wood, that he might not
be prevented from meeting at the Place appoint|ed,
which he repair'd to at Sun-ri&s;e, where <HI>Atimir</HI>
<PB N="157" REF="166">
arriv'd &s;oon after. The&s;e two Rivals, impatient to
revenge them&s;elves, and to gain the Victory, drew
their Swords; which was the fir&s;t time the Prince
of the <HI>Peaceable I&s;land</HI> ever made u&s;e of his, &s;ince
there was never any War in his Dominions.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, he appear'd not the le&s;s formidable
Enemy to <HI>Atimir,</HI> for tho he had but little Expe|rience,
he had Courage, was in love, and fought
like a Man that de&s;pi&s;ed Death; while <HI>Atimir</HI> main|tain'd
the great Reputation he had &s;o worthily gain'd.</P>
<P>The&s;e two Princes were animated by Pa&s;&s;ions
too much different, not to render the End of this
Duel fatal; for after they had a long time main|tain'd
an equal Advantage, they made two &s;uch
furious Thru&s;ts at each other, that both fell on the
Gra&s;s, which they dyed with their Blood.</P>
<P>The Prince of the <HI>Peaceable I&s;le</HI> fainted away in|&s;tantly
with the lo&s;s of his; and <HI>Atimir,</HI> mortally
wounded, pronounced the Name of <HI>Hebe</HI> as he expir'd.</P>
<P>Some of tho&s;e Per&s;ons, who were &s;ent to look
for the Prince of the <HI>Peaceable I&s;land,</HI> arriv'd at that
fatal Place, and were &s;eiz'd with Horrour at &s;o di&s;|mal
a &s;ight.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s <HI>Hebe,</HI> drawn by her Di&s;quiet, was
going into the Gardens, when hearing the Shrieks
of People, who pronounced confu&s;edly the Names
of the two Princes, &s;he hereupon ran and found
tho&s;e &s;o &s;ad and di&s;mal Objects; &s;he thought that
the Prince her Husband was dead as well as <HI>Atimir,</HI>
who at that time were both alike to her: when af|ter
having look'd &s;ome time on tho&s;e unhappy Prin|ces,
&s;he cry'd out dolefully, &startq;Ye precious Lives,
which were &s;acrificed for me, I will revenge you
by the lo&s;s of my own.&endq; And after the&s;e Words
fell on the fatal Sword <HI>Atimir</HI> receiv'd from her, and
had pierced her Brea&s;t before the People (who were
amazed at this cruel Adventure) could hinder her.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as &s;he expired, the Fairy <HI>Anguilletta</HI> appear'd,
who, touch'd with &s;o many Misfortunes, which &s;he
had oppo&s;ed with all her power, accu&s;ed Fate, and
<PB N="158" REF="167">
could not forbear &s;hedding of Tears. Then think|ing
of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Prince of the <HI>Peaceable I&s;land,</HI>
whom &s;he knew was not dead, &s;he cured him of
his Wounds, and tran&s;ported him in&s;tantly into his
own <HI>I&s;le;</HI> where, by the wonderful Gift &s;he had be|&s;tow'd
on it, that Prince was con&s;olated for the
Lo&s;s he had &s;u&s;tain'd, and forgot his Pa&s;&s;ion for
<HI>Hebe.</HI></P>
<P>The King and Queen, who had not the like A&s;|&s;i&s;tance,
gave them&s;elves up entirely to their Grief,
which was only to be worn off by Time: and as
for <HI>Ileria,</HI> her De&s;pair cannot be expre&s;s'd; who was
always both faithful to her Grief, and the ungrate|ful
<HI>Atimir.</HI></P>
<P>When <HI>Anguilletta</HI> had tran&s;ported the Prince of
the <HI>Peaceable I&s;land</HI> into his own Dominions, &s;he
touch'd with her Wand the unfortunate Remains of
the lovely <HI>Atimir</HI> and beautiful <HI>Hebe,</HI> who in an in|&s;tant
were changed into two Trees of an admira|ble
Beauty, which the Fairy named <HI>Ch$rms,</HI> to pre|&s;erve
for ever the Remembrance of tho&s;e, which

<HEAD>The Story of Don FERDINAND
of Toledo.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Count <HI>de Fuentes,</HI> who was a Gentle|man
that lived for the mo&s;t part at <HI>Madrid,</HI>
had the misfortune to have a very trou|ble&s;ome
Wi$e; who, when he was young,
tormented him with Jealou&s;ies, and when he was
in years, per&s;ecuted his Children. She had two
Daughters and a Nephew; the elder, who was cal|led
<PB N="159" REF="168">
<HI>Leonora,</HI> was fair and witty, her Shape both ea&s;y
and noble, her Features all regular, and her Wit
&s;eem'd &s;o agreeable and judicious, that &s;he gain'd
both the E&s;teem and Friend&s;hip of all that knew
her. <HI>Matilda,</HI> the younger, had black Hair, a live|ly
Complexion, &s;parkling Eyes, delicate Teeth, an
Air of Gayety, and &s;o plea&s;ing a Behaviour, that
&s;he was no le&s;s engaging than her Si&s;ter. And for
Don <HI>Franci&s;co,</HI> their Cou&s;in, he was valued and e|&s;teem'd
by all as a Man of Worth.</P>
<P>Two Gentlemen, who were their Relations,
who&s;e Names were, Don <HI>James de Ca&s;areal,</HI> and Don
<HI>Ferdinand de Toledo,</HI> lived &s;o nigh to the Count <HI>de
Fuentes,</HI> that they had contracted a great Friend&s;hip
with Don <HI>Franci&s;$o;</HI> and by often coming to vi&s;it
him, &s;een his Cou&s;ins, and were grown &s;en&s;ible
of their Charms: but their Mother's Vigilance was
&s;o great, as to di&s;turb the&s;e Di&s;po&s;itions, by threat|ning
to put them into Religious Hou&s;es, if ever
they &s;poke to Don <HI>James</HI> and Don <HI>Ferdinand;</HI> and to
the&s;e Menaces added two Duegna's, more watchful
than <HI>Arg$s:</HI> which new Ob&s;tacles only augmented
the&s;e two Gentlemens Pa&s;&s;ion. The Mother di&s;co|ver'd
every day &s;ome new piece of Gallantry of
theirs, which put her into a great Rage; and know|ing
that her Nephew gave his Friends a thou&s;and
Opportunities to &s;ee his Cou&s;ins, either in their
Balconies, or by walking with them in the Gar|dens,
&s;he was quite tired with continually chiding
them: therefore, to fru&s;trate all their De&s;igns, one
day, when the Count her Husband was gone to
Court, &s;he took her Daughters with her in a Coach,
and drove away for <HI>Cadiz,</HI> hard by which Place
the Count had a very con&s;iderable E&s;tate; leaving
a Letter behind her, wherein &s;he de&s;ired him to
come to her, and bring her Nephew along with
him. But the Count <HI>de Fue$tes,</HI> who was wearied
out with his Wife's odd Humours, in&s;tead of follow|ing
her, ble&s;s'd his Stars that he had got rid of her,
and pitied his Daughters.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="169">
When Don <HI>James</HI> and Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> were inform|ed
by Don <HI>Franci&s;co</HI> of their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es Departure,
they were extremely grieved, and thought of all
ways po&s;&s;ible to induce them to come to <HI>Madrid</HI>
again; but upon Don <HI>Franci&s;co's</HI> telling them, that
their Endeavours that way would only prevent
them, they re&s;olved to go for <HI>Cadiz,</HI> hoping that
they might find there &s;ome favourable Opportunity
of Di&s;cour&s;e with them, and de&s;ired Don <HI>Franci&s;co,</HI>
who could not refu&s;e, to go along with them. The
old Counte&s;s was overjoy'd to &s;ee him; it was &s;ome
time before &s;he knew that Don <HI>James</HI> and Don
<HI>Ferdinand</HI> were there, who &s;aw her Daughters eve|ry
night thro a grated Window, that look'd into a
little Street; where, in&s;tead of complaining of their
Fate, they &s;wore an eternal Fidelity to each other,
and comforted them&s;elves with flattering Hopes.
But the Duegnas under&s;tood their bu&s;ine&s;s too well,
to be long deceiv'd by the&s;e Lovers; in &s;hort, they
&s;urprized them at the Window, and notwith&s;tand|ing
their Prayers and Intreaties, went and told the
Counte&s;s.</P>
<P>The Mother was &s;o enraged at this News, that
&s;he aro&s;e, tho it was not Day, had her Coach got
ready, and convey'd her Daughters to a Ca&s;tle about
a day's Journey from <HI>Cadiz,</HI> &s;colding them all the
way; and we may ea&s;ily imagine that &s;o &s;udden a
Departure put our Lovers into the utmo&s;t Di&s;order.
One &s;igh'd, and the other complain'd, and when|ever
Don <HI>Franci&s;co</HI> went to the <HI>A&s;pegnas,</HI> which was
the Name of the Ca&s;tle, they &s;ent Letters and Pre|&s;ents
by him, which he forced his Cou&s;ins to ac|cept,
becau&s;e he knew their &s;incere Intentions to
marry them; and whenever he return'd from the
<HI>A&s;pegnas,</HI> Don <HI>James</HI> and Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> pre&s;s'd him
to go again, and conjur'd him to find out &s;ome
way or other to take them along with him; but
that was an Affair &s;o nice, that Don <HI>Franci&s;co</HI> &s;eem'd
to he&s;itate at it, thinking it was enough that he
could procure them the means of writing to them.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="170">
Don <HI>Franci&s;co</HI> having &s;tay'd &s;ome few days with
his Aunt, ju&s;t when he was going away, the

was arriv'd at <HI>Cadiz,</HI> and that if any thing
would invite her to go there, it would be her
De&s;ire to &s;ee him. Whereupon, Don <HI>Franci&s;co</HI> taking
this Opportunity to be &s;erviceable to his Friends,
by procuring them an Interview with his Cou&s;ins,
an&s;wered, That he was particularly well acquaint|ed
with the Amba&s;&s;ador's two Sons, who were Men
of Wit and Politene&s;s; and that, if &s;he would
promi&s;e to receive them with all the Ceremonies
of their Country, he would endeavour to bring
them to &s;ee her: And knowing that his Aunt was
very nice upon the Point of Gentility, and that
her Clo&s;et was hung round-with E&s;cutcheons and
Atchievements, he told her, That as &s;oon as the
Amba&s;&s;ador's Sons were inform'd of her Quality,
they would be impatient till they had paid their
Re&s;pects to her; and withal added, That they
might tell of the Greatne&s;s of her Birth in their
Country, and that this Vi&s;it might be an Imbe|li&s;hment
to her Genealogy.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s, who had as much Vanity as
Curio&s;ity, thinking that this would make a great
noi&s;e in the whole Country, &s;eem'd overjoy'd at
this Propo&s;ition of her Nephew's, and told him
&s;he was very much obliged to him, bidding him
neglect nothing to procure her the Plea&s;ure of
a Vi&s;it from tho&s;e polite <HI>Mahometants.</HI></P>
<P>Don <HI>James</HI> and his Cou&s;in went to meet Don
<HI>Franci&s;co,</HI> &s;o eager were they to hear News from
their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es; and after having read their Let|ters,
thank'd Don <HI>Franci&s;co</HI> for all his good Offices,
who told them all that had pa&s;s'd between him
and his Aunt, advi&s;ed them to provide Habits, and
practi&s;e their parts, a&s;&s;uring them that he would
act his to the be&s;t advantage. The two Lovers
&s;eem'd charm'd with Don <HI>Franci&s;co's</HI> Thought, and
prais'd both his Wit and Addre&s;s. They went
<PB N="162" REF="171">
about their clothing with all di&s;patch, ordered
&s;ome rich Ve&s;ts of Cloth of Gold to be made, and
Cymitars &s;et with Jewels, Turbants, and whatever
was nece&s;&s;ary for this Ma&s;querade; and, by good
fortune, they met with a Painter who had an Oil
that made the Skin as brown as they wanted to have
it: and when all things were ready, Don <HI>Fran$$&s;co</HI>
&s;ent one of his Servants to the Counte&s;s, to let
her know the day that he de&s;ign'd to bring the
Amba&s;&s;ador's Sons. The Counte&s;s was in a great
hurry to put every thing in order, to receive the&s;e
illu&s;trious <HI>Moors;</HI> &s;he ordered her Daughters to
neglect nothing to make them appear lovely in
their Eyes: and her Severity which extended over
all other Nations, was laid a&s;ide in regard to
that of <HI>M$rocco;</HI> becau&s;e &s;he being a great De|voree,
look'd upon them as <HI>B$rbarians</HI> and Enemies
to the Faith; therefore &s;he thought it impo&s;&s;ible
for a <HI>Spani&s;h Woman</HI> ever to love a Man that had
nto been baptized, and &s;o fancy'd &s;he ran no ri&s;que
by expo&s;ing her Daughters to the &s;ight of tho&s;e
gallant <HI>Africans.</HI></P>
<P>As it was Evening when they arrived, the
Ca&s;tle was full of Lights. The Counte&s;s receiv'd
them upon the Stairs, and they &s;aluting her, made
&s;uch extraordinary low Bows, lifted up their
Hands &s;o often, and made &s;o many Hah's and
Hoh's, that Don <HI>Franci&s;$o,</HI> who con&s;train'd him&s;elf as
much as po&s;&s;ible, could not forbear laughing. The
Counte&s;s, in her turn, paid her Compliments, but
could not forbear cro&s;&s;ing her&s;elf as often as they
pronounced <HI>Hala!</HI> And it was not without great
Acknowledgements, that &s;he receiv'd Pieces of
Brocade, Fans, China, carved Stones of curious
Workman&s;hip, and other Rarities they brought
with them for her and her Daughters, which they
&s;aid were common things in their Country; &s;peak|ing
all the time &s;uch broken <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> that they
could hardly under&s;tand them. The good Coun|te&s;s
was tran&s;ported with all the&s;e Honours; but
<PB N="163" REF="172">
while they entertain'd her with all the Di&s;traction
that Love cau&s;es when the Object is before the
Eyes, whatever Guard they had upon them&s;elves,
they could not help looking upon their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es,
and fixing their Eyes upon them. Donna <HI>Leonora</HI>
felt a &s;ecret Unea&s;ine&s;s that flattered her Heart,
the Rea&s;on of which &s;he could not di&s;cover; and tho
&s;he knew Don <HI>Ferd$nand's</HI> Eyes, and di&s;covered
&s;ome of Don <HI>James's</HI> Features in one of the <HI>Mo$rs,</HI>
&s;he knew them not in that brown Complexion, and
in tho&s;e Habits.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s carried them into a large Gallery
hung with Pictures, and &s;hew'd them one &s;he had
lately bought, which was a Piece of <HI>Cupids</HI> at
play, wherein one, to frighten the re&s;t, had put on
a Mask. Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> commended the Painter's
Fancy, and the Excellence of the Work, in
terms that &s;hewed both his Wit and Judgment;
and &s;taying loitering behind, while the Counte&s;s
was talking with her Nephew, writ with his
Pencil the&s;e Words under the mask'd <HI>Cupid,</HI>
<Q><L>Es condid$ a todos</L>
<L>Por &s;ervi&s;to de tus lindos ojos.</L>
<L>I hide my&s;elf from all the World, to &s;ee your fair Eyes.</L></Q></P>
<P>No &s;ooner had <HI>Leonora</HI> read them, but &s;he unfold|ed
the Riddle, and conceiv'd a Trouble intermixed
with Joy. Don <HI>F$rdinand</HI> found that &s;he had di&s;|covered
the My&s;tery, and was glad of it; he ap|pear'd
more gay and li$ely, and in all their Con|ver&s;ation
&s;aid a thou&s;and pretty things, wherein
<HI>Leonora</HI> had part: who, whatever plea&s;ure &s;he might
take in hearing them, could not forbear taking
her Si&s;ter a&s;ide, and communicating her Thoughts
to her. &startq;Ah! my dear <HI>Matilda, &s;aid &s;he,</HI> are
not you afraid as well as me, le&s;t Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI>
and Don <HI>James</HI> &s;hould be known?&endq; &startq;What do you
mean, <HI>replied</HI> Matilda, I don't under&s;tand you?&endq;
&startq;Alas! <HI>continued</HI> Leonora, your Eyes are but bad
<PB N="164" REF="173">
Servants to your Heart: What have you not
ob&s;erved that that <HI>Moor,</HI> who has never left you, is
Don <HI>James,</HI> and he who talk'd to me, Don <HI>Ferdi|nand?</HI>&endq;
&startq;Is it po&s;&s;ible, <HI>cried</HI> Matilda, that what
you tell me &s;hould be true?&mdash;But, <HI>continued
&s;he,</HI> his Looks and every Action leave me no room
to doubt of it.&endq; Ju&s;t as they rejoin'd their Cou|&s;in
and Lovers, they heard the Counte&s;s propo&s;e
taking a walk in the Garden, which was lighted
with Lamps down to a Wood, which was at the
bottom of the Garden, which was a glorious Sight.
The Company pa&s;&s;ed through a large Walk, on
ea$h &s;ide of which was a Canal, to a Bower of
Je&s;&s;amins, Oranges, and Honey&s;uckles; in the
mid&s;t of which was a Fountain playing, which by
its gentle Murmurs, excited the Nightingales to
join in Concerts, which made it a &s;weet abode.
They placed them&s;elves on fine enamell'd Banks,
in form of Benches, and were regaled with Jellies,
Chocolate, and all manner of fine Sweet-meats,
till Supper was ready; and as the Counte&s;s &s;tudied
to plea&s;e and divert the <HI>Moors,</HI> and as Stories were
very much in fa&s;hion, &s;he bid <HI>Leonora</HI> tell one:
which Command, that beautiful Lady not daring
to refu&s;e, &s;he began as follows.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>The Story of the Yellow Dwarf.</HEAD>
<P>THERE was a Queen, who, tho &s;he had ma|ny
Children, could get but one to live, which
was a beautiful Daughter; and being left a Widow,
and without hopes of having any more, was &s;o much
afraid of lo&s;ing her, that &s;he never gave her any
Correction for what Faults &s;he committed: in&s;o|much
that that admirable Per&s;on, who knew her
own Beauty, and that &s;he was born to a Crown,
was &s;o vain and proud of her growing Charms, that
<PB N="165" REF="174">
&s;he de&s;pi&s;ed all the World be&s;ides. The Queen
her Mother contributed, by her Care&s;&s;es and Com|plai&s;ance,
to per&s;uade her none were de&s;erving of
her; &s;he was dre&s;s'd every day either like a <HI>Pallas</HI>
or <HI>Diana,</HI> follow'd by her Nymphs: and in &s;hort,
the Queen, to give the fini&s;hing Stroke to her Va|nity,
call'd her <HI>All-Fair;</HI> and having had her Pi|cture
drawn by the be&s;t Painters, &s;ent it to all the
Kings with whom &s;he was in Alliance, who, when
they &s;aw it, were not able to re&s;i&s;t the inevitable
power of her Charms; &s;ome fell &s;ick, others run
mad, and tho&s;e who e&s;cap'd either Sickne&s;s or Mad|ne&s;s,
came to her Court, and as &s;oon as they &s;aw
her became her Slaves.</P>
<P>Never was any Court more gallant and po|lite;
twenty Kings &s;tudied to plea&s;e her, who, after
they had &s;pent immen&s;e Sums upon an Entertain|ment
upon her, thought them&s;elves fully recom|pens'd
if &s;he &s;aid any thing was pretty in them.
The Adorations that were paid her over-joy'd the
Queen her Mother; not a day pa&s;s'd over her head
but &s;he had thou&s;ands of Songs and fine Copies of
Ver&s;es &s;ent by all the mo&s;t famous Poets in the
World. In &s;hort, <HI>All-Fair</HI> was the only Subject of the
mo&s;t renown'd Authors, both in Pro&s;e and Ver&s;e.
The Prince&s;s was about fifteen; there were none
who did not de&s;ire to marry her, but they dur&s;t not
pretend to that Honour, it was &s;o difficult a Task
to touch an Heart of that &s;tamp. Her Lovers mur|mur'd
very much again&s;t her Cruelty, and the
Queen, who wanted to have her married, knew
not how to gain her Con&s;ent; &s;ometimes &s;he would
&s;ay to her, &startq;Will you not abate &s;omewhat of that
intolerable Pride, that makes you contemn all the
Kings that come to our Court? I will chu&s;e one
for you, &s;hew me in this &s;ome Complacency.&endq; &startq;I
am already happy, <HI>reply'd</HI> All-Fair, in the ea&s;y In|difference
I now live in; if I &s;hould once lo&s;e
that, you would perhaps be angry.&endq; &startq;I &s;hould be
angry if you loved any one beneath you, <HI>an&s;wer'd
<PB N="166" REF="175">
the Queen;</HI> but you cannot have more de&s;erving
Princes than tho&s;e that now ask you.&endq; In &s;hort,
the Prince&s;s was &s;o prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd of her own Merit,
that &s;he thought it greater than what it was; and
by this Re&s;olution of hers to live a Maid, began to
grieve her Mother &s;o much, that &s;he repented, but
too late, that &s;he had humour'd her &s;o much.</P>
<P>The Queen, uncertain what to do, goes all alone
to find a celebrated Fairy, that was call'd the <HI>De|&s;art
Fairy;</HI> but as it was an hard thing to &s;ee her,
becau&s;e &s;he was guarded by two Lions, unle&s;s &s;he
made a Cake for them of Millet, Sugarcandy, and
Crocodiles Eggs, &s;he prepared one her&s;elf, and
put it into a little Basket, which &s;he hung upon her
Arm: but being wearied with walking farther than
&s;he was u&s;ed to, &s;he laid her&s;elf down under the
&s;hade of a Tree to re&s;t her&s;elf, and there in&s;en&s;ibly
fell a&s;leep, and when &s;he awaked found only her
Basket, and her Cake gone; and, to compleat her
Misfortune, heard the Lions coming. &startq;Alas! <HI>cry'd
&s;he,</HI> what will become of me? I &s;hall be devour'd.&endq;
And having no power to &s;tir, &s;he lean'd again&s;t the
Tree &s;he had &s;lept under&punc; when hearing &s;omebody
&s;ay. <HI>Hem, h$m!</HI> &s;he look'd about on all &s;ides, and
rai&s;ing her $yes, perceiv'd a little Man in the Tree,
about half a Yard in height, eating Oranges, who
&s;aid to her, &startq;O Queen, I know you, and the fear
you are in l$&s;t the&s;e Lions &s;hould de$our you; I
cannot blame you, they have de$our'd a great ma|ny,
and, to your misfortune, you want a Cake.&endq;
&startq;I mu&s;t re&s;olve on Death. <HI>r$ply'd the Queen &s;ighing;</HI>
but alas! I &s;hould not be &s;o much griev'd was my
dear Girl but married!&endq; &startq;What! Have you a Daugh|ter?
<HI>&s;aid the $span$, who was called &s;o from his
Complexion and the Ora$$e-tree he liv'd in:</HI> Indeed I
am very glad of $$at, for I have &s;ought after a
Wife both by Sea and Land; now if you will pro|mi&s;e
me I &s;hall have her, I will &s;ecure you both
from Lions. Tyger$ and Bears.&endq; The Queen look'd
at him, as much frighten'd at his horrible little Fi|gure
<PB N="167" REF="176">
as at the Lions, and mu&s;ing &s;ome time, re|turn'd
no An&s;wer. &startq;What, do you he&s;itate, Madam?
&startq;<HI>cry'd he,</HI> it &s;eems you are not very fond of Life.&endq;
At the &s;ame time the Lions appear'd on the top of
a &s;mall Hill, running towards her; at which &s;ight
the Queen, who trembled like a Dove when &s;he
&s;ees a Kite, cry'd out with all her might, &startq;Good
Sir Dwarf, <HI>All-Fair</HI> is yours.&endq; &startq;Oh! <HI>&s;aid he with an
Air of Di&s;dain, All-Fair</HI> is too fair, I will not have
her.&endq; &startq;O Sir, <HI>continu'd the afflicted Queen,</HI> don't re|fu&s;e
her, &s;he is the mo&s;t charming Prince&s;s in the
World.&endq; &startq;Well, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> I will take her out of
Charity; but remember the Gift you make me.&endq;
And thereupon the Orange-tree open'd, and the
Queen was let into it, and &s;o e&s;caped from the Li|ons.
She was vex'd &s;he could find no Door to that
Tree, when at la&s;t &s;he perceiv'd one that open'd
into a Field full of Nettles and Thi&s;tles, &s;urrounded
with a muddy Ditch; in the middle thereof &s;tood a
little thatch'd Hou&s;e, out of which the yellow
Dwarf came in a plea&s;ant Air, wooden Shoes, a
coar&s;e yellow Stuff Jacket, and without any Hair
to hide his large Ears. &startq;I am glad, good Mother-in-law,
<HI>&s;aid he to the Queen,</HI> to &s;ee you in this my
Abode, where your Daughter is to live with me;
&s;he may keep an A&s;s to ride out on with the&s;e
Nettles and Thi&s;tles, and may &s;ecure her&s;elf from
the Injuries of the Weather under this ru&s;tick
Roof; &s;he will have this Water to drink, and
may eat &s;ome of the&s;e Frogs that are fatten'd in
it: be&s;ides, I &s;hall always bear her Company, and
never &s;hall leave her.&endq;</P>
<P>When the unfortunate Queen came to con&s;ider
on the deplorable Life this Dwarf promi&s;ed her
dear Child, &s;he was not able to &s;upport the terrible
Idea, but fell into a Swoon, and had not the power
to &s;ay one word; and while &s;he was in that Con|dition,
was convey'd to her own Bed, in a fine Suit
of Night-clothes of the newe&s;t Fa&s;hion. As &s;oon
as the Queen came to her&s;elf, &s;he remembered what
<PB N="168" REF="177">
had happen'd, but knew not how to believe it,
&s;eeing &s;he was in her own Palace, in the mid&s;t of
all the Ladies of her Court, and her Daughter by
her Bed-&s;ide: but the fine Night-clothes, which
were of a curious Lace, amaz'd her as much as the
Dream &s;he fancy'd &s;he had had; and thro the Ex|ce&s;s
of her Di&s;quiet &s;he fell into &s;uch an extraordi|nary
Fit of Melancholy, that &s;he hardly either &s;poke,
eat, or &s;lept. The Prince&s;s, who lov'd her at her
heart, was very much griev'd, and often ask'd her
what was the matter; when the Queen, to deceive
her, told her &s;ometimes it proceeded from her ill
State of Health, and other times from &s;ome of the
neighbouring Princes Threatnings to make War
again&s;t her. Tho <HI>All-Fair</HI> found the&s;e An&s;wers very
plau&s;ible, however &s;he knew there was &s;omething
more in the bottom, which the Queen endeavour'd
to hide from her; and being no longer able to en|dure
her Unea&s;ine&s;s, re&s;olved to go to the De&s;art-Fairy,
to ask her Advice whether or no &s;he &s;hould
marry, &s;ince &s;he was &s;o much pre&s;s'd to it: &s;he
took care to make a Cake to appea&s;e the Lions, and
pretending to go to bed earlier than ordinary, went
down a pair of back Stairs in a white Veil that
reach'd to her Feet, to &s;et forward on her Jour|ney.</P>
<P>When the Prince&s;s came to the fatal Orange-tree,
&s;he &s;aw it &s;o loaded with Fruit, that &s;he had a great
mind to gather &s;ome; whereupon, &s;he &s;et down
her Basket, and pluck'd &s;ome and eat them; but when
&s;he went to look for her Basket and Cake, and
found them taken away, her Grief was inexpre&s;&s;i|ble,
and turning about, e&s;py'd the little frightful
Dwarf, who &s;aid to her, &startq;What makes you cry,
Child?&endq; &startq;Alas! who can forbear? <HI>replied &s;he,</HI> I
have lo&s;t my Basket and Cake, which were &s;o
nece&s;&s;ary in my Journey to the De&s;art-Fairy's.
What want you with her? <HI>an&s;wered this little Mon|key,</HI>
I am her Relation and Friend, and am as
knowing to the full.&endq; &startq;The Queen my Mother,
<PB N="169" REF="178">
<HI>replied the Prince&s;s,</HI> is grown very melancholy,
which makes me fear for her Life; I fancy I may
be the cau&s;e of it, &s;ince &s;he has de&s;ired me to
marry, and I mu&s;t own to you, I have not yet
found any one that I think de&s;erving enough of
me: The&s;e are the Rea&s;ons that have engaged
me to &s;peak with the Fairy.&endq; &startq;Prince&s;s, give
your&s;elf no further trouble, <HI>&s;aid the Dwarf,</HI> I am
more proper to inform you about the&s;e things:
The Queen your Mother is vex'd, that &s;he has
promi&s;ed you in Marriage.&endq; &startq;The Queen pro|mi&s;ed
me in Marriage! <HI>&s;aid &s;he, interrupting him;</HI>
undoubtedly you are mi&s;taken, &s;he would cer|tainly
have told me of it: I am too much con|cern'd
in that Affair, to be engaged without my
own Con&s;ent.&endq; &startq;Beautiful Prince&s;s, <HI>&s;aid the Dwarf,
throwing him&s;elf at her feet;</HI> I flatter my&s;elf this
Choice will not be di&s;plea&s;ing to you, when I tell
you I am de&s;tin'd to that Happine&s;s.&endq; &startq;My Mo|ther
cho&s;e you for a Son-in-Law! <HI>cry'd</HI> All-Fair,
<HI>falling back &s;ome Steps;</HI> was ever any Folly like
yours?&endq; &startq;I am not very fond of the Honour, <HI>&s;aid
he, in a Pa&s;&s;ion;</HI> but here are the Lions, who will
revenge my Affront.&endq;</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time the Prince&s;s heard the Lions
roaring: &startq;What will become of me! <HI>&s;aid &s;he;</HI> mu&s;t
I thus end my Days!&endq; The wicked Dwarf look'd
at her, and with a malicious Smile &s;aid, &startq;You &s;hall
have the Glory of dying, and not be&s;towing your
&s;hining Merit on a poor mi&s;erable Dwarf, &s;uch
as I am.&endq; &startq;Pray be not angry, <HI>&s;aid the Prince&s;s,
lifting up her hands;</HI> I'd rather marry all the Dwarfs
in the World, than die after &s;o frightful a man|ner.&endq;
&startq;Ob&s;erve me well, Prince&s;s, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> before
you give me your Word, for I do not pretend to
&s;urprize you.&endq; &startq;I have already, <HI>reply'd &s;he;</HI> but
the Lions approach towards me, &s;ave me, or I
&s;hall die with fear.&endq; In &s;hort, &s;he fell into a
Swoon, and without knowing how &s;he got there,
found her&s;elf in her own Bed, in the fine&s;t Linen
<PB N="170" REF="179">
and Ribbons po&s;&s;ible, with a Ring of one &s;ingle
red Hair &s;o fa&s;t upon her Finger, that &s;he could
not get it off.</P>
<P>When the Prince&s;s &s;aw all this, and remembred
what had pa&s;s'd before, &s;he grew &s;o melancholy,
that all the Court were &s;urprized and unea&s;y at it;
the Queen was mo&s;t alarm'd of all, and ask'd a
thou&s;and times what was the matter, but &s;he was
determin'd in her&s;elf to conceal her Adventure
from her. At la&s;t the States of the Kingdom, im|patient
to have their Prince&s;s married, a&s;&s;embled,
and addre&s;s'd the Queen to make choice of an
Husband for her out of hand; the Queen told
them, it was what &s;he had mo&s;t at heart, but that
her Daughter was very much again&s;t it: however,
&s;he advi&s;ed them to go to her, and talk with her
about it, which they did immediately. <HI>All-Fair,</HI>
who&s;e Pride was &s;omewhat abated, &s;ince her Adven|ture
with the Yellow Dwarf, thought it would be the
be&s;t way to marry &s;ome potent Prince, with whom
that little Ape would not dare to di&s;pute &s;o glo|rious
a Conque&s;t; and gave them a favourable An|&s;wer,
and con&s;ented to marry the King of the Gol|den
Mines, who was a powerful and hand&s;ome
Prince, who loved her with a violent Pa&s;&s;ion, and
who never till then dur&s;t entertain any hopes. We
may ea&s;ily gue&s;s at the Exce&s;s of his Joy, and his
Rival's Rage, when the News was declared. There
were great Preparations made again&s;t the Nuptials,
and the King of the Gold Mines launch'd out &s;uch
prodigious Sums of Money, that the Sea was full
of Ships, that were &s;ent to the remote&s;t Parts for
the greate&s;t Rarities. In &s;hort, that Prince di&s;co|ver'd
&s;uch lively and delicate Sentiments, that &s;he
began to have &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ion for him. Thus were
they both happy, when one day the King, who
was both gallant and in love, took the liberty to
di&s;cover his Tenderne&s;s to her in the Garden, in
Ver&s;es of his own making; among which, he re|peated
the&s;e Lines:
<PB N="171" REF="180">
<Q><L>The verdant Leaves but out when you appear,</L>
<L>And all the Trees their brighte&s;t Liverys wear;</L>
<L>The Flow'rs &s;pring forth by your indulgent Heat,</L>
<L>And am'rous Birds their little Songs repeat:</L>
<L>In this ble&s;t Place, di&s;tant from Care and Crowns,</L>
<L>All Nature &s;miles, and you her Godde&s;s owns.</L></Q></P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of all this Joy, the King's Rivals,
who were in the utmo&s;t de&s;pair at his Good-for|tune,
and &s;en&s;ible of the mo&s;t piercing Grief, left
the Court, and return'd to their own Dominions,
not being able to be Eye-witne&s;&s;es to the Prince&s;s's
Marriage; but before they went, they took their
leaves of her in &s;o obliging a manner, that &s;he
could not but pity them. &startq;O! Madam, <HI>&s;aid the
King of the Gold Mines,</HI> what do you rob me of, by
granting your Pity to Lovers, who are over and
above recompenced for their pains by one &s;ingle
Look from you!&endq; &startq;I &s;hould be angry, <HI>reply'd he
Prince&s;s,</HI> if you was in&s;en&s;ible of the Compa&s;&s;ion
I have &s;hewn tho&s;e Princes, to whom I am lo&s;t
for ever; it is a Proof of your Delicacy, which
I approve of: But, Sir, their Conditions are far
different from yours; you ought to be plea&s;ed
with what I have done for you, they have no
rea&s;on to be &s;o, therefore you &s;hould re&s;train your
Jealou&s;y.&endq; The King of the Golden Mines was
&s;o confounded at the obliging manner that the Prin|ce&s;s
took a thing that might very well have di&s;|plea&s;ed
her, that he threw him&s;elf at her feet, ki&s;s'd
her hand, and ask'd a thou&s;and pardons.</P>
<P>At la&s;t the long-wi&s;h'd-for Day came, and the
Nuptials were proclaim'd, by &s;ounding of Trum|pets,
and all other Ceremonies; the Balconies were
all adorn'd with Tape&s;tries, and the Hou&s;es bedeck'd
with Flowers. The Queen was &s;o overjoy'd, that
&s;he was hardly in bed, and got to &s;leep, but &s;he
ro&s;e again to give the nece&s;&s;ary Orders, and to
chu&s;e out the Jewels the Prince&s;s was to wear that
<PB N="172" REF="181">
day. She was cover'd almo&s;t over with Diamonds,
and on her Gown, which was a &s;ilver Brocade,
were twelve Suns form'd with Diamonds. But no|thing
appear'd &s;o bright as that Prince&s;s's natural
Charms; a rich Crown was &s;et upon her Head, her
Hair hung down almo&s;t to her feet, and the Maje|&s;ty
of her Shape di&s;tingui&s;h'd her from all the Ladies
that attended on her. The King of the Gold Mines
&s;hew'd him&s;elf no le&s;s accompli&s;h'd and magnificent;
Joy and Chearfulne&s;s appear'd in all his Actions:
none approach'd him, but he loaded them with his
Gifts and Pre&s;ents; for he had order'd &s;ome thou|&s;ands
of Tons of Gold, and velvet Sacks, imbroi|der'd
with Pearls, full of Guineas, to be placed in
the Hall, where all that put forth their Hands, re|ceived
Handfuls of Gold; in&s;omuch that this part
of the Ceremony drew there great Crouds of Peo|ple,
that would have been in&s;en&s;ible of all the o|ther
Plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>As the Queen, King, and Prince&s;s, were going
out into a long Gallery, they &s;aw a Box move to|wards
them, in which there &s;at a large old Wo|man,
at who&s;e Age and Decrepidne&s;s they were not
&s;o much &s;urprized, as at her Ugline&s;s: &s;he lean'd
upon a Crutch, had a black taffety Ruff on, a red
velvet Hood, and a Fardingale all in Rags; and af|ter
having taken two or three Turns about, with|out
&s;peaking a word, &s;he &s;topt in the middle of the
Gallery, and &s;haking her Crutch in a threatning
manner, cry'd out, &startq;Ho, ho! you Queen and Prin|ce&s;s,
do you think to fal&s;ify, unpuni&s;h'd, your
Words, which you gave my Friend the Yellow
Dwarf; I am the De&s;art-Fairy, and don't you
know, that if it had not been for him and his O|range-tree,
you had been devour'd by my Lions.
The&s;e In&s;ults to Fairys &s;hall not be allow'd; think
pre&s;ently on what you de&s;ign, for I &s;wear by my
Coif, you &s;hall marry him, or I will burn my
Crutch.&endq; &startq;Ah! Prince&s;s, <HI>&s;aid the Queen in Tears,</HI>
what is this that I hear? what have you pro|mi&s;ed?&endq;
<PB N="173" REF="182">
&startq;Ah! Mother, <HI>reply'd the Prince&s;s, full of
Grief,</HI> what have you promi&s;ed?&endq; The King of
the Gold Mines, enraged at what had pa&s;s'd, and
that this wicked old Woman &s;hould come to op|po&s;e
his Happine&s;s, drew his Sword, and going up
towards her, pointed it to her Throat, &startq;Wretch,
<HI>&s;aid he,</HI> be gone from hence, or I'll revenge thy
Malice on thy Life.&endq; He had no &s;ooner pronoun|ced
the&s;e words, but the upper part of the Box
flew off with great noi&s;e, and out came the Yellow
Dwarf, mounted on a large <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Cat, and placed
him&s;elf between the De&s;art-Fairy and the King of
the Gold Mines: &startq;Ra&s;h Youth, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> think not
to commit this Violence on the illu&s;trious Fairy,
thy Rage &s;hould light on me; I am thy Rival and
thy Enemy: the fal&s;e Prince&s;s, who was going to
be&s;tow her&s;elf on thee, has given me her Word,
and receiv'd mine; &s;ee if &s;he has not a Ring of
my Hair upon her Finger, by that you may judge
of my Right to her.&endq; &startq;Hideous Mon&s;ter, <HI>&s;aid the
King,</HI> ha&s;t thou the Boldne&s;s to call thy&s;elf the
Adorer of this Divine Prince&s;s, and to pretend to
&s;o glorious a Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion? Thou art &s;uch a Ba|boon,
&s;uch an odious Figure, that I had &s;acrificed
thee before now, had&s;t thou been worthy of &s;o
honourable a Death.&endq; The Dwarf piqued to the
very Soul at tho&s;e words, clap'd his Spurs in the
Cat's Sides, which made &s;uch a mewing, and fly|ing
about, as frighten'd all but the King; who hem|med
in the Dwarf &s;o clo&s;e, that he drew a large Cut|la&s;h,
with which he was arm'd, and defying the
King to a Combat, went down into the Court of
the Palace, making a terrible noi&s;e. The enraged
King follow'd him as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible; and when
they &s;tood oppo&s;ite to each other, ready to begin
the Combat, the Sun on a &s;udden turn'd as red as
Blood, and it grew as dark as pitch; it thunder'd
and lighten'd, and by the Fla&s;hes of the Lightning
the King and all the Court, who were got into the
Balconies, perceiv'd two Giants vomiting Fire on
<PB N="174" REF="183">
each &s;ide of the Dwarf: All which was not capa|ble
of daunting the magnanimous Heart of this
young Monarch, who &s;hew'd a wonderful Intrepi|dity
in his Locks and Actions, that encouraged all
who were concern'd for his Safety, and gave the
Dwarf and his Enemies &s;ome Confu&s;ion. But all
his Courage was not proof again&s;t what he &s;aw the
Prince&s;s endure; when the De&s;art-Fairy, with her
Head cover'd with Snakes, like <HI>T$&s;iphone,</HI> and moun|ted
on a wing'd Griffin, &s;truck her &s;o hard with a
Lance &s;he carried in her Hand, that &s;he fell into the
Queen's Arms all over Blood. This tender Mother,
who was touch'd to the very Soul to &s;ee her Daugh|ter
in this Condition, made mo&s;t &s;ad Complaints;
and for the King, he lo&s;t both all his Rea&s;on and
Courage, left the Combat, and ran to the Prince&s;s,
to &s;uccour her, or die with her: but the Yellow
Dwarf would not give him time to get to her, but
flew on his <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Cat into the Balcony where &s;he
was, and took her out of her Mother's Arms, and
from all the Ladies, and then leaping upon the top
of the Palace, di&s;appear'd with his Prey.</P>
<P>The King, confu&s;ed and motionle&s;s, look'd on
&s;uch an extraordinary Adventure with the utmo&s;t
de&s;pair, &s;ince it was not in his power to help it;
when to compleat his Misfortunes, he found a Mi&s;t
before his Eyes, and him&s;elf lifted up by &s;ome ex|traordinary
Power in the Air. For the wicked
Fairy, who came to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Yellow Dwarf in ta|king
away the Prince&s;s, had no &s;ooner &s;et he Eyes
on the King of the Gold Mines, but her Heart grew
&s;en&s;ible of that young Prince's Merit, and that he
might be her Prey; &s;he therefore carried him to
the bottom of a frightful Cavern, and there loaded
him with Chains fix'd to a Rock, hoping that the
Dread of an approaching Death might make him
forget <HI>All-Fair,</HI> and engage him to do as &s;he would
have him. As &s;oon as he arrived there, &s;he re|&s;tored
him his Sight, and borrowing, by the Fairy-Art,
all tho&s;e Charms and Graces that Nature had
<PB N="175" REF="184">
deny'd her, appear'd to him like a lovely Nymph,
that was come that way by chance. &startq;What is
this that my Eyes behold? <HI>&s;aid &s;he:</HI> What have
you done, charming Prince, that you are kept
here?&endq; Whereupon the King, deceiv'd by the&s;e
fal&s;e Appearances, reply'd; &startq;Alas! fair Nymph, I
know not what the infernal Fury that brought
me hither, would have; for tho, when &s;he took
me away, &s;he depriv'd me of my Sight, and has
not &s;ince appear'd, yet I knew by her Voice, that
&s;he was the De&s;art-Fairy.&endq; &startq;Oh! Sir, <HI>cry'd the
fal&s;e Nymph,</HI> you are in the hands of a Woman,
who will never let you go till you marry her;
'tis what &s;he has done by &s;everal Heroes: &s;he is
the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate Woman in the World in the&s;e
Affairs.&endq; But while &s;he pretended to bear a &s;hare
in the King's Affliction, he perceiv'd her Griffin-feet,
which was always a Mark by which the Fai|ry
was known in all her Metamorpho&s;es, and which
&s;he could not change; and &s;eeming to take no no|tice
of it, but &s;peaking in an Air of Confidence,
&s;aid, &startq;Indeed, I have no Aver&s;ion for the De&s;art-Fairy,
but I cannot bear that &s;he &s;hould protect
the Yellow Dwarf, and keep me chain'd thus like
a Criminal: What have I done? I love, 'tis true,
a charming Prince&s;s, and had I my Liberty, it
would engage me in gratitude to love her.&endq; &startq;Do
you u&s;e Sincerity?&endq; <HI>&s;aid the pretended Nymph.</HI>
&startq;Doubt you of it? <HI>reply'd the King:</HI> I am a Novice
in the Art of Di&s;&s;embling; and I mu&s;t own to
you, a Fairy has much more to flatter my Vanity
with, than a Prince&s;s; but if I loved her to Di|&s;traction,
and &s;he confined me, I &s;hould hate
her.&endq;</P>
<P>Deceiv'd by the&s;e Words, the De&s;art-Fairy re|&s;olv'd
to tran&s;port him to a Place, as agreeable as
this was horrible; and to that end, obliged him to
get into her Chariot, which was then drawn by
Swans, whereas it was generally drawn by Bats.
But in what a Condition was this Prince, when as
<PB N="176" REF="185">
he was traver&s;ing the wa&s;te Space of Air, he &s;aw
his dear Prince&s;s in a Ca&s;tle of poli&s;h'd Steel, the
Walls of which ca&s;t &s;uch a Reflection when the
Sun &s;hin'd, that there was no going near it; &s;he
was laid in a Grove by a Brook-&s;ide, leaning her
Head on one hand, and wiping away her Tears
with the other: and as &s;he was looking up to Hea|ven
to ask Relief, &s;he &s;aw the King pa&s;s along with
the De&s;art-Fairy, who, as &s;he had made u&s;e of her
Art to &s;eem hand&s;ome to that young Monarch, &s;he
appear'd to the Prince&s;s the mo&s;t charming Per&s;on
in the World. &startq;What, <HI>cry'd &s;he,</HI> am not I unfor|tunate
enough, to be in this inacce&s;&s;ible Ca&s;tle,
whither this ugly Dwarf has brought me; but to
add to my Misfortunes, I mu&s;t be tormented with
Jealou&s;ies? Mu&s;t I be inform'd by &s;uch an ex|traordinary
Adventure of the Infidelity of the King
of the Gold Mines, who has certainly thought, that
by lo&s;ing the &s;ight of me, he was freed from his
Oaths? But who can this formidable Rival be,
who&s;e fatal Beauty &s;urpa&s;&s;es mine?&endq; While &s;he
was &s;aying the&s;e words, the amorous King felt a
mortal Pain, in being carried away with &s;uch &s;wift|ne&s;s
from the dear Object of his Vows: had he not
known the Fairy's Power, he would certainly have
try'd to have got from her, either by killing her,
or &s;ome other means that his Love and Courage
would have &s;ugge&s;ted to him; but how could he
attempt any thing at that time?</P>
<P>The Fairy al&s;o perceiv'd the Prince&s;s, and &s;ought
in the King's Eyes to penetrate into the Effect that
&s;ight might produce in his Heart. &startq;None can in|form
you &s;o well as my&s;elf of what you want to
to know, <HI>&s;aid he to her;</HI> the unexpected meeting
with that unhappy Prince&s;s, for whom I had once
&s;ome re&s;pect, before I was acquainted with your
Charms, gave me &s;ome &s;mall di&s;turbance; but
you have &s;o much a greater Sway over me, that
I would &s;ooner die, than be fal&s;e to you.&endq; &startq;Ah!
Prince, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> may I flatter my&s;elf with having
<PB N="177" REF="186">
in&s;pir'd you with &s;uch favourable Sentiments for
me.&endq; &startq;Time &s;hall convince you, Madam, <HI>reply'd
he;</HI> but if you would make me &s;en&s;ible, that I
have any part in your E&s;teem, deny not <HI>All-Fair</HI>
your A&s;&s;i&s;tance.&endq; &startq;Do you know what you ask?
<HI>an&s;wer'd the Fairy, knitting her Brow, and frowning:</HI>
What would you have me make u&s;e of my Know|ledge
again&s;t the Yellow Dwarf, who is my be&s;t
Friend, to force a proud Prince&s;s, whom I mu&s;t look
upon as my Rival, out of his hands? No, I cannot
bear the thoughts of it.&endq; At that the King &s;igh'd
inwardly, but dur&s;t return no An&s;wer. At la&s;t they
came to a large Meadow, enamelled with various
Flowers, and &s;urrounded by a deep River, into
which there ran &s;everal &s;mall Brooks, which form|ed
Meanders about little Holts of Trees, where
there was always a fre&s;h Air: at a &s;mall di&s;tance
&s;tood a &s;tately Palace, the Walls of which were of
tran&s;parent Emeralds, and as &s;oon as the Swans that
drew them alighted, thou&s;ands of beautiful Per|&s;ons
came to receive the Fairy with Acclamations
of Joy, and Songs in prai&s;e of her Charms and her
Choice; which overjoy'd the Fairy, to hear them
mention her Amours. She led the King into the
mo&s;t magnificent Apartment that had ever been &s;een
in the memory of Fairies, and leaving him there,
and thinking &s;he was not &s;ure &s;he had captivated
him, &s;he got into an ob&s;cure Place, from whence
&s;he might ob&s;erve all his Actions; and he fancying
&s;he would watch him, went to a large Gla&s;s, and
&s;aid to it, &startq;Faithful Ad$i&s;er, permit me to &s;tudy
out Ways to render my &s;elf agreeable to the charm|ing
Fairy, whom I adore; for great is my De&s;ire
to plea&s;e.&endq; And thereupon he painted, powder'd,
and patch'd, put on a magnificent Suit of Clothes
that lay ready for him, and adju&s;ted him&s;elf the
be&s;t he could.</P>
<P>Upon this the Fairy went in unto him, &s;o much
tran&s;ported with Joy, that &s;he could not moderate
it. &startq;I &s;hall not forget, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> the care you have
<PB N="178" REF="187">
taken to plea&s;e me; you have found out the true
and only way: you &s;ee, Sir, it is not &s;o difficult,
when People plea&s;e.&endq; The King, who thought
that &s;aying fine things to the Fairy was the be&s;t
Card he could play, &s;pared no &s;oft Expre&s;&s;ions at
this juncture, and by that means got leave to take
a Walk on the Sea-&s;hore, which the Fairy, by her
Art, had render'd &s;o dangerous and boi&s;terous, that
no Pilots were &s;o bold as to venture to &s;ail in it;
&s;o that &s;he was under no Apprehen&s;ions of her Pri|&s;oner's
e&s;caping, who thought it a great A&s;&s;uage|ment
to his Pains, to mu&s;e along, and think of his
deare&s;t Prince&s;s, without being interrupted by his
hateful Goaler. When he had walk'd there &s;ome
time, ki&s;s'd the Sand, and invoked the Powers of
the Sea, he heard a Voice, which made him give
great Attention, and ob&s;erving the Waves to &s;well,
and regarding them &s;tedfa&s;tly, he perceiv'd a beau|tiful
Mermaid ari&s;e, with a Looking-gla&s;s in one
hand, and combing her Hair, which was gently a|gitated
by the Winds, with the other. At this
&s;ight the King was very much &s;urpriz'd, but much
more, when it came and &s;aid to him; &startq;I know the
&s;ad Condition you are reduced to, by your Sepa|ration
from your Prince&s;s, and the De&s;art-Fairy's
Pa&s;&s;ion for you; if you approve of it, I will carry
you away from this fatal Place, where, perhaps,
you may langui&s;h out thirty or forty Years.&endq; The
King knew not what An&s;wer to return, not but he
de&s;ir'd to be deliver'd from his Captivity, but for
fear the Fairy had a&s;&s;umed a new Form to deceive
him: and as he he&s;itated, the <HI>Syren,</HI> who gue&s;s'd at
his Thoughts, &s;aid, &startq;Fear not, this is no Snare laid
for you, I am too much an Enemy to the De&s;art-Fairy,
and the Yellow Dwarf, to &s;erve them: I &s;ee
your unfortunate Prince&s;s every day, her Beauty
and Merit rai&s;es my Pity; and I tell you again,
if you have any Confidence in me, I will a&s;&s;i&s;t
you to get away.&endq; &startq;I have &s;o much in you, <HI>cry'd
the King,</HI> that I will do whatever you bid me;
<PB N="179" REF="188">
but &s;ince you have &s;een my Prince&s;s, tell me &s;ome
news of her.&endq; &startq;We &s;hall lo&s;e too much time in
talking, <HI>reply'd the</HI> Syren; come along with me,
and I will carry you to the Steel-Ca&s;tle, and
leave on this Shore a Figure &s;o like you, that the
Fairy &s;hall be deceiv'd by it.&endq;</P>
<P>She pre&s;ently cut down &s;ome Sea-Ru&s;hes, and
bundling them together, and blowing upon them,
&s;aid, &startq;My good Friends, I order you not to &s;tir off
from this Beach, till the De&s;art-Fairy comes and
takes you away.&endq; Whereupon a Skin grew &s;oon
over the Ru&s;hes, and they became &s;o like the King
of the Gold Mines, that it was &s;urprizing; they
were clothed like the King, and looked pale and
dead, as if he had been drown'd. After this the
<HI>Syren</HI> made the King &s;it upon her Fi&s;h's Tail, and
both &s;ail'd away in a rolling Sea, with all imagin|able
Satisfaction. When they were at &s;ome di&s;tance
from the Shore, the <HI>Syren</HI> &s;aid, &startq;I will now tell
you how the wicked Dwarf carried the Prince&s;s
away; he &s;et her behind him on his <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Cat,
and notwith&s;tanding the Blood &s;he lo&s;t by the
Wound &s;he receiv'd from the De&s;art-Fairy, which
made her &s;woon away, he never &s;top'd to give
her A&s;&s;i&s;tance, till he had her &s;afe in his Steel-Ca&s;tle,
where he was receiv'd by &s;ome of the mo&s;t
beautiful Per&s;ons in the World, which he had
tran&s;ported thither, who all &s;hew'd a great de&s;ire
to &s;erve the Prince&s;s; who was put into a Bed of
Cloth of Gold, embroider'd with large Pearls.&endq;
&startq;O! <HI>cry'd the King of the Gold Mines,</HI> he has married
her; I &s;woon and die away.&endq; &startq;No, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> a&s;|&s;ure
your&s;elf the Prince&s;s's Con&s;tancy is too firm
to admit of that.&endq; &startq;Then go on,&endq; <HI>reply'd he.</HI> &startq;What
I have more to tell you, is, <HI>continu'd the</HI> Syren, &s;he
was in the Grove you pa&s;s'd over, and &s;aw you
with the De&s;art-Fairy, who was &s;o painted, that
&s;he &s;eem'd to her of a much &s;uperior Beauty to
her&s;elf, and her De&s;pair is not to be compre|hended,
&s;ince &s;he fancies you love her.&endq; &startq;I love

her! <HI>cry'd the King:</HI> Ju&s;t Heavens! how much is
&s;he deceiv'd? What ought not I to do, to make

your own Heart, <HI>an&s;wer'd the</HI> Syren, <HI>with a gra|cious
Smile;</HI> People that are deeply engaged have
no need of Advice on that account.&endq; And ju&s;t as
&s;he made an end of the&s;e Words, they arriv'd at
the Steel-Ca&s;tle, which on the Sea-&s;ide the Dwarf
had not fortified with tho&s;e burning Walls.</P>
<P>&startq;I know, <HI>&s;aid the</HI> Syren, the Prince&s;s is by the
&s;ame Brook-&s;ide, where you &s;aw her as you pa&s;s'd
by; but as you will have a great many Enemies
to fight with before you can come to her, take
this Sword, with which you may undertake any
thing, and face the greate&s;t Dangers, provided
you never let it go out of your hand. Farewel,
I &s;hall retire under that Rock you &s;ee there; if

the&s;e words &s;he gave him the Sword, which
was made of one entire Diamond, that gave as
great a Lu&s;tre as the Sun; upon the receiving it, he
could u&s;e no words expre&s;&s;ive enough for an Ac|knowledgment,
but de&s;ir'd her to make it up in
thinking all that a generous Mind was capable
of.</P>
<P>But to return to the De&s;art-Fairy: When &s;he
&s;aw that her Lover did not return, &s;he ha&s;ten'd af|ter
to find him, running all along the Shore, at|tended
with an hundred young Dam&s;els, loaded
with Pre&s;ents for him, &s;ome brought great Baskets
full of Diamonds, &s;ome golden Ve&s;&s;els of admirable
Work, &s;ome Ambergrea&s;e, Coral, and Pearls, and
&s;ome carried great Pieces of Stuffs upon their Heads,
of prodigious Richne&s;s; others, Flowers, Fruits, and
Birds; in &s;hort, every thing that might be accepta|ble.
But in what a &s;ad Condition was the Fairy,
when following this noble Troop, &s;he &s;aw the
<PB N="181" REF="190">
Ru&s;hes in the &s;hape of the King of the Gold Mines;
&s;he was &s;o amazed and grieved, that &s;he gave a
terrible Shriek, that made the Hills echoe again,
and &s;eem'd more furious than <HI>Megara, Alecto,</HI> and
<HI>Ti&s;iphone</HI> together: &s;he threw her&s;elf upon the Bo|dy,
cry'd, howled, and tore fifty of the Per&s;ons
that were with her in pieces, as a Sacrifice to the
<HI>Manes</HI> of the dear decea&s;ed. Then &s;he call'd ele|ven
of her Si&s;ter-Fairies, to help her to erect a
&s;tately Mau&s;oleum to this young Hero; who were
all as much deceiv'd as her&s;elf by the <HI>Syren,</HI> who
was more powerful than they. But while they were
providing Porphyry, Ja&s;pire, Agate, Marble, Statues
and Devices in Gold and Bra&s;s, to immortalize the
Memory of the King, whom they thought to be
dead, he thank'd the lovely <HI>Syren,</HI> conjuring her to
grant him her Protection; which &s;he engaging him
&s;he would, he had nothing to do but to advance
towards the Steel-Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>Thus guided by his Love, he went forward, and
looking carefully about, perceiv'd his adorable
Prince&s;s; but was not long without Employment,
for four terrible <HI>Sphinxes</HI> flew at him, and had torn
him into a thou&s;and pieces, had it not been for
the <HI>Syren's</HI> Sword, which glitter'd &s;o in their Eyes,
that they fell down at his Feet without any
Strength; and he gave each a mortal Wound, and
&s;o proceeded on, till he met with &s;ix Dragons,
who&s;e &s;caled Skins were harder than Iron: what|ever
fear &s;uch Creatures might have put &s;ome into,
he was intrepid, and with his Sword cut them all
a&s;under, and thought he had &s;urmounted the ut|mo&s;t
Difficulties, when he met with the greate&s;t of
all; which was four and twenty Nymphs, holding
in their Hands long Garlands of Flowers, with
which they &s;top'd his Pa&s;&s;age: &startq;Whither are you
going, Sir? <HI>&s;aid they;</HI> we are appointed to guard
this Place, and if we let you pa&s;s, it will be bad
both for you and us, therefore pray be not ob&s;ti|&s;tinate:
&s;ure you would not imbrue your victo|rious
<PB N="182" REF="191">
Arm in the Blood of &s;o many young inno|cent
Dam&s;els, who have done you no wrong.&endq; At
the&s;e words the King, who was a great Admirer
of the Fair Sex, and had profe&s;s'd him&s;elf always
their Protector, was &s;o confounded to think that
he mu&s;t force his Pa&s;&s;age thro them, that he knew
not what to re&s;olve on; when he heard a Voice
&s;ay, &startq;Strike, &s;trike, or you lo&s;e your Prince&s;s for
ever.&endq; Whereupon, without making any Reply,
he threw him&s;elf into the mid&s;t of the Nymphs,
gave them no quarter, and &s;oon di&s;per&s;ed them.
This being the la&s;t Ob&s;tacle he had to meet with,
he went into the Grove, where the Prince&s;s lay
pale and langui&s;hing by a Brook-&s;ide; and upon his
approaching trembling towards her, &s;he flew from
him with as much Indignation, as if he had been
the Yellow Dwarf. &startq;Condemn me not, Madam,
<HI>&s;aid he,</HI> before you hear me; I am neither fal&s;e,
nor guilty of what you imagine, but only an un|fortunate
Wretch, that has di&s;plea&s;ed you with
Repugnance to him&s;elf.&endq; &startq;Ah! barbarous Man,
<HI>cry'd &s;he,</HI> I &s;aw you traver&s;ing the Air with a
beautiful Per&s;on; was that again&s;t your Con&s;ent?&endq;
&startq;Yes, Prince&s;s, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> it was: the wicked De&s;art-Fairy,
not &s;atisfied with chaining me to a Rock,
took me with her in her Chariot, and convey'd
me to a di&s;tant Part of the World, where I &s;hould
have langui&s;h'd out my Days, without hope of
any Succour, had it not been for a kind <HI>Syren,</HI>
that brought me hither. I come, my Prince&s;s,
to deliver you out of the hands of tho&s;e that de|tain
you here; refu&s;e not the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the
mo&s;t faithful of Lovers.&endq; Thereupon he threw
him&s;elf at her feet, and catching hold of her Gown,
unfortunately let fall the formidable Sword, which
the Yellow Dwarf, who lay hid behind &s;ome &s;mall
Shrub, no &s;ooner &s;aw out of the King's Hand, but,
knowing its Power, he ran and &s;eized it.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s, at the &s;ight of the Dwarf, gave
a terrible Shriek; but all her Complaints &s;erved
<PB N="183" REF="192">
only to exa&s;perate the little Mon&s;ter, who by two
cabali&s;tical Words conjur'd up two huge Giants,
that loaded the King with Irons. &startq;I am now, <HI>&s;aid
the Dwarf,</HI> Ma&s;ter of my Rival's Fate; however,
I will grant him his Life and Liberty, on condi|tion
he con&s;ents to my Marriage.&endq; &startq;No, I will
die a thou&s;and Deaths fir&s;t,&endq; <HI>cry'd the amorous King
in a Rage.</HI> &startq;Alas! <HI>reply'd the Prince&s;s,</HI> the Thoughts
of that is the mo&s;t terrible of all.&endq; &startq;Nothing
&s;hocks me &s;o much, <HI>an&s;wer'd the King,</HI> as that you
&s;hould become a Victim to this Mon&s;ter.&endq; Then
&s;aid the Prince&s;s, &startq;Let us die together.&endq; &startq;No, my
Prince&s;s, <HI>&s;aid the King,</HI> let me have the Satisfac|tion
of dying for you.&endq; &startq;I'd &s;ooner con&s;ent, <HI>&s;aid
&s;he,</HI> to the Dwarf's De&s;ires.&endq; &startq;Oh! cruel Prince&s;s,
<HI>interrupted the King,</HI> &s;hould you marry him before
my face, my Life would ever after be odious to
me.&endq; &startq;No, it &s;hall not be before thy face, <HI>reply'd
the Dwarf,</HI> for a beloved Rival I cannot bear.&endq;
And at tho&s;e words he &s;tabbed the King to the
heart; who&s;e Death the Prince&s;s was not able to
&s;urvive, but fell on her dear Prince's Body, and
poured out her Soul with his. Thus died the&s;e
two illu&s;trious, but unfortunate Lovers, before the
<HI>Syren</HI> could apply any Remedy, all her power lying
in the fatal Sword.</P>
<P>The wicked Dwarf was better plea&s;ed to &s;ee his
Prince&s;s void of Life, than in the Arms of another;
and the De&s;art-Fairy being inform'd of this Adven|ture,
conceiv'd as great an Hatred again&s;t the Me|mory
of the King of the Gold Mines, as Love for
his Per&s;on, and de&s;troy'd the Mau&s;oleum &s;he had
erected. And for the kind Mermaid, who was
grieved at this Misfortune, &s;he could obtain no o|ther
Favour of Fate, but to change them into two
Palm-Trees; which pre&s;erving a faithful and la&s;ting
Pa&s;&s;ion for each other, care&s;s and unite their Bran|ches

<P>WHEN <HI>Leonora</HI> had made an end of her Sto|ry,

he had been walking with the old Counte&s;s,
cro&s;&s;ing a Je&s;&s;amine Walk, where he &s;topt her with
Re&s;pect; and &s;eeing he was alone with her, threw
him&s;elf at her feet, and &s;aid, &startq;What Man, Madam,

you are too amiable and good to puni&s;h, with &s;o

therefore &s;ince you have made a Cap|tive

to hope, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Leonora; think but of rendering
your Sentiments as agreeable to my Father as to
me, and&endq;&mdash;Here &s;he made a Pau&s;e, being un|able
to pur&s;ue a Conver&s;ation which began to be
&s;o tender, but by her Trouble alone explained her
Thoughts. At which Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> was &s;o much
overjoyed, he took hold of one of her fair Hands,
and was ju&s;t going to ki&s;s it, when all on a &s;udden
he felt &s;omebody pull him &s;o hard by one Leg, that
he had much ado to avoid falling upon his No&s;e: But
what a Confu&s;ion was he in, when ri&s;ing up &s;udden|ly
to revenge him&s;elf on the Per&s;on that offered
him &s;uch an In&s;ult before his Mi&s;tre&s;s's face, he
perceived it was the Counte&s;s, who had &s;tood be|hind
him, and heard all he &s;aid, without being &s;een
either by him&s;elf or <HI>Leonora.</HI> For this di&s;tru&s;tful
old Lady having ob&s;erved, that this pretended <HI>Moor</HI>
had &s;oon left her to return to the Bower, and fear|ing
le&s;t he &s;hould meet with either of her Daugh|ters,
followed him &s;oftly, and &s;aw, by the light of
the Lamps, that he was at <HI>Leonora's</HI> feet: however,
though &s;he was very much enraged, yet had &s;he
patience enough to hear the tender Conver&s;ation
of the&s;e two Lovers; but when he catched hold of
her Daughter's hand, &s;he thought it improper to be
any longer only a Spectator. &startq;Ha! Don <HI>Ferdinand,
cry'd &s;he,</HI> is it you who have taken all this pains to
di&s;gui&s;e your&s;elf like a <HI>Moor,</HI> to continue your

void of Rea&s;on to hear you, and &s;uffer you to ki&s;s

confounded, that it is more ea&s;y to imagine the

Condition they were in, than to de&s;cribe it: How|ever,
as he flattered him&s;elf, that the Counte&s;s had
not heard all they &s;aid, he &s;oon recovered him&s;elf,
and with &s;ome boldne&s;s reply'd, &startq;What, Madam, is
it a Crime in <HI>Spain</HI> to &s;peak to a fair Lady, and to
ki&s;s her hand; in my Country 'tis a &s;ign of Re|&s;pect.&endq;
&startq;And in mine, <HI>&s;aid the Counte&s;s in a Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI>
'tis a &s;ure proof of a Per&s;on's being undone; but
whether you are a <HI>Moor</HI> or a <HI>Ca&s;tilian,</HI> I tell you,
I am no longer to be deceived.&endq; Therefore load|ing
her Daughter with the mo&s;t cruel Reproaches,
&s;he obliged her to go into the Hou&s;e with <HI>Matild$,</HI>
where &s;he put them both under lock and key.</P>
<P>Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and Don <HI>James</HI> were &s;o much en|raged,
that had it not been for Don <HI>Franci&s;co,</HI> they
had returned the Violence &s;he did them, by taking
away their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es. The Lights and Entertain|ment
vani&s;hed away like an Enchantment, the Coun|te&s;s
&s;aid the mo&s;t &s;evere things in the world to her
Nephew, and told him, &startq;That if he went not away
immediately with his two Devils, (<HI>as &s;he called
the&s;e two Gentlemen</HI>) &s;he &s;hould have recour&s;e to
whatever Rage and Pa&s;&s;ion could induce her to.&endq;
Never any Entertainment ended &s;o di&s;mally; the
two Lovers and their Friend were in de&s;pair, to
leave the two young Ladies in &s;uch cruel hands;
for when we are really in love, we are more con|cerned
for the Per&s;on we love, than our own par|ticular
Satisfaction. But however they were ob|liged
to go without their Supper, half dead with
Rage and Hunger; and what vexed them mo&s;t, was,
that they had but very little talk with their Mi&s;|tre&s;&s;es,
and had left them expo&s;ed in the hands of
an enraged Mother, who doubted &s;ome time whe|ther
the&s;e Sparks were Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and Don
<HI>James;</HI> for they were very well di&s;gui&s;ed: but at
la&s;t was per&s;uaded within her&s;elf that they were
two <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who, according to all appearances,
came only to &s;ee and &s;peak to her Daughters.</P>

As the&s;e Gentlemen returned back to <HI>Cadiz,</HI> they

Coach-doors, and jumped out; and clapping his

him, and Don <HI>Franci&s;co</HI> followed with all imaginable
precipitation: &startq;What Fury po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es you, <HI>cry'd he,</HI>
would you cut each other's Throats on this ac|count?
live for the Per&s;ons you love, who alone
are tho&s;e you &s;hould per&s;uade of the Greatne&s;s of
your Pa&s;&s;ions, without undertaking a Duel, which
they would be very angry at, &s;hould they hear of
it.&endq; Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e good Rea&s;ons, the two
Lovers had a great mind to be thru&s;ting, to re|venge
on each other the Injury the Counte&s;s of
<HI>Fuentes</HI> had done them; but at la&s;t were appea&s;ed
by the Intreaties of their Friend, and got into the
Coach again, both a&s;hamed of a readine&s;s that
<PB N="188" REF="197">
wounded &s;o much the &s;incere Friend&s;hip they had

him, &startq;That he &s;hould be in the utmo&s;t De&s;pair at
all the Accidents that had befallen them; but that
he flattered him&s;elf that his Father's Return would
calm this Tempe&s;t.&endq; When they got to <HI>Cadiz,</HI> they
were informed of the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Toledo's</HI> Arrival;
at which Don <HI>Ferdinard</HI> and Don <HI>James</HI> were over|joyed,
and renewed their Promi&s;es to their Friend
to marry his Cou&s;ins, if the Count of <HI>Fuentes</HI> would
give his Con&s;ent: and thereupon Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> de|&s;ired

<P>Soon after, meeting with a Friend of theirs, and

it, and to contribute as much as po&s;&s;ible to|wards
the compleating of their De&s;ires. Don <HI>Ferdi|nand</HI>
adding withal, &startq;That he mu&s;t acquaint his
Father, that he never could meet with a more
virtuous and charming Lady; and thinking it pro|per
to convince him of her Beauty, gave his Friend
her Picture to &s;hew him.&endq; For their parts they
failed not to go and pay their Re&s;pects to the Mar|qui&s;s
<HI>de Toledo;</HI> and for Don <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> who had his
Rea&s;ons to endeavour to plea&s;e him, he never &s;eemed
&s;o glad of his Return, nor &s;o complai&s;ant and dili|gent
before. Their Friend, to gratify them in their
<PB N="189" REF="198">
Reque&s;t, waited on the Marqui&s;s, and informed
him of the Advantage that might accrue from an
Alliance with the Count of <HI>Fu$$$es;</HI> moreover,
he &s;hewed him that charming Lady's Picture, and
told him, &startq;He was per&s;ua$ed that, without men|tioning
her other Beauti$$, which were all per|fect,
he mu&s;t approve of her Face.&endq; With which
the Marqui&s;s was &s;o much plea&s;ed, that he de&s;ired
him to leave the Picture with him.</P>
<P>When he was alone, he looked on it with an ex|traordinary

(<HI>continued he</HI>) why am I thinking of marrying my
Son, I am not too old my &s;elf to renounce Matri|mony
yet; I'll inform my&s;elf fir&s;t of her Temper,
and then re&s;olve.&endq; Whereupon &s;ending for Don
<HI>F$rdinand,</HI> and after having commended his Choice,
he enquired after her Humour and Di&s;po&s;ition:
To all which his amorous Son an&s;wered, with all
the Exaggerations of a Lover, employing all his
Eloquence; in&s;omuch that the Father was no ways
tired with asking Que&s;tions, nor the Son with an|&s;wering
them; and not thinking what Pains and
Trouble he had prepared for him&s;elf, ob&s;erved with
plea&s;ure the Attention his Father gave, and from
thence drew &s;uch happy Pre&s;ages, that he no lon|ger
di&s;puted his own Happine&s;s, knowing that the
Count <HI>de Fuentes</HI> would not refu&s;e him; and there|fore
he continued to &s;peak Wonder$ of his Mi&s;tre&s;s,
to engage his Father to favour the Marriage, which
the Father promi&s;ed him to do, and $o bring him
&s;ome good News. Don <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> tran&s;ported with
Joy, returned Thanks proportionate to the Happi|ne&s;s
he hoped for, and as &s;oon as he retired, writ
to <HI>Leonora,</HI> to inform her how Affairs went: which
Letter &s;he received by her Cou&s;in's, Management,
notwith&s;tanding the Vigilance of the Counte&s;s.</P>
<P>While Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and his Mi&s;tre&s;s plea&s;ed each

our two Families, I ask the lovely <HI>Matilda</HI>
for my Son.&endq; The Count <HI>de Fuentes</HI> an&s;wer'd with
all the Civility and Tokens of Joy the Marqui&s;s
could promi&s;e him&s;elf, and then embracing, they
gave each other their words; and having thus a|greed
on the Bu&s;ine&s;s between them&s;elves, re&s;olved
to keep it private. The Count <HI>de Fuentes</HI> could not
avoid &s;peaking of it to his Wife to get her Con&s;ent;
but at the &s;ame time de&s;ired her to &s;ay nothing of it
to her Daughters, thinking his Approbation &s;uffi|cient.
The Marqui&s;s of <HI>Toledo,</HI> when he returned
to <HI>Cadiz,</HI> told Don <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> &startq;That every thing
went well, and that in a &s;hort time he &s;hould be
happy:&endq; without entering into any further Par|ticulars,
&s;o that he could not di&s;cover the Trick his
Father put upon him; and as they were equally
impatient, they both pre&s;&s;ed forward the Wedding-Day.
And for Don <HI>James,</HI> who&s;e Pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Matil|da</HI>
was as great as Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI>'s for <HI>Leonora,</HI> he
urged on the Marqui&s;s to ask for her, that the two
Si&s;ters might be both married at the &s;ame time; and
the old Fox, who took care to inform him&s;elf of all
that pa&s;&s;ed, promi&s;ed to do it effectually: but fear|ing
le&s;t the Cheat &s;hould be found out before every
thing was made &s;ure, he pre&s;&s;ed for <HI>Leonora</HI>'s and
<PB N="191" REF="200">
<HI>Matilda</HI>'s Return to <HI>Cadiz;</HI> which Pretext the Count
<HI>de Fuentes,</HI> who could not endure the Country, was
glad of, to bring his Family to a more agreeable
Place.</P>
<P>But as two &s;uch di&s;cerning Men as Don <HI>Ferdi|nand</HI>
and Don <HI>James</HI> were not to be long deceiv'd,
when they found out the Perfidy they were treated
with, they abandon'd them&s;elves to whatever Rage
and De&s;pair could in&s;pire; and for Don <HI>Ferdinand,</HI>
the Condition he was in, when he knew his own
Father to be the Object of his Revenge, is not to
be repre&s;ented: &startq;Alas, <HI>&s;aid he to Don</HI> Franci&s;co, I
ought not to puni&s;h him, but my&s;elf, who &s;hew'd
him my Mi&s;tre&s;s's Picture, and took &s;o much pains
to inform him of all her good Qualities: How
could I think him capable of &s;eeing it with Indif|ference?
Has not Love Arrows to wound the Old
as well as Young? Where were my Thoughts,
when I &s;hew'd him that charming Per&s;on?&endq; Then
falling from the&s;e Reflections into others more vio|lent;
&startq;How can I, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> excu&s;e him for taking
from me the Per&s;on I love? I can hearken to no
Con&s;iderations of Re&s;pect, therefore no one can
be a&s;&s;ured of the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my Mi&s;tre&s;s, but
by my Death.&endq; For Don <HI>James,</HI> he had no &s;uch
Ties to bound his Revenge, &s;o he promi&s;ed him&s;elf
one proportionate to the Injury receiv'd; but as they
both knew that <HI>Leonora</HI> and <HI>Matilda</HI> were to come to
Town the next day, they de&s;ir'd Don <HI>Franci&s;co</HI> to
go and meet them, and inform them of all that
had pa&s;s'd: which Reque&s;t he acquie&s;ced with, not|with&s;tanding
his Aunt's Anger, to whom he had
often writ in vain, to endeavour to ju&s;tify him&s;elf
on the Adventure of the <HI>Moors,</HI> and deliver'd a Let|ter
from Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> to <HI>Leonora,</HI> in the&s;e words:</P>
<P><HI>Beautiful</HI> Leonora,
&startq;THE Exce&s;s of my Grief is not to be expre&s;s'd
by any Words I can u&s;e: My Father would
de&s;troy all my Hopes, rob me of your Heart, and
<PB N="192" REF="201">
marry you; I have not enjoy'd my&s;elf &s;ince this
frightful News reach'd my Ears. I no longer

prevent all the Misfortunes of my Life; &s;uffer
m$ to conduct you to &s;ome Place, that may &s;erve
for a San$$uary to our Loves, which is the only
Remedy again&s;t &s;uch pre&s;&s;ing Misfortunes: which,
Madam, if you refu&s;e, I &s;hall no longer &s;eek to

<P>Don <HI>Franci&s;co</HI> arriv'd at the <HI>A&s;pegnas</HI> ju&s;t as the
Counte&s;s was coming away, and the hurry they
were in at their Removal gave him an opportunity
of Di&s;cour&s;e with his Cou&s;ins. But, O Heavens!
how great was their Grief at this fatal and unex|pected
News, which &s;urprized them like a Thun|der-Clap?
However, Don <HI>Franci&s;co</HI> comforted them
the be&s;t he could and told them, that if they would
but give their $on&s;ents, Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and Don
<HI>James</HI> would &s;ecure them again&s;t that dete&s;ted Mar|riage;
but that to &s;ucceed, they mu&s;t play their
Parts well, and &s;eem gay and plea&s;ed when at <HI>Ca|diz,</HI>
and then he would warrant all things would
fall out according to their Wi&s;hes. &startq;Oh! dear
Cou&s;in, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Leonora, you flatter us too much;
after this Misfortune our Fears are great, and
Hopes but &s;mall, however, I am re&s;olved to follow
your Advice, and will conceal my Sorrow as well
as I am able when at <HI>Cadiz:</HI> but I beg of you to
a&s;&s;ure Don <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> that I am ready to do what
he de&s;ires.&endq; &startq;And rell Don <HI>James</HI> the &s;ame thing

my Heart and Hand &s;hall be given to none but

you mu&s;t write, I will carry your Letters.&endq;
Whereupon <HI>Leonora</HI> &s;at down, and writ the&s;e
Lines:</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="202">
&startq;DON <HI>Franci&s;co</HI> can tell you the Condition I am

your De&s;ign &s;ucceed: which I not only approve
of, Sir, but will follow you with plea&s;ure, on
Terms agreeable to my Honour and Virtue.&endq;</P>
<P><HI>Matilda's</HI> was as follows:</P>
<P>&startq;EXPECT not from me eloquent Complaints,
the Stroke that wounds you de&s;troys me, and
the greate&s;t Sorrow is &s;ometimes be&s;t expre&s;s'd by
Silence; but as it often proceeds to the utmo&s;t
Extremities, depend on it, I will &s;econd you in
your De&s;igns to unite our Fates for ever.&endq;</P>
<P>Don <HI>Franci&s;co</HI> return'd to <HI>Cadiz,</HI> where the two
Lovers waited for him with Impatience, and were
overjoy'd at their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es generous Re&s;olutions;
who, while they were giving the nece&s;&s;ary Orders,
arrived, and di&s;&s;embled their Grief to admiration.
No &s;ooner were they got to Town, but the Mar|qui&s;s
came to &s;ee them without Don <HI>F$rdinand,</HI>
whom he told, with an Air of Confu&s;ion, of his
Intentions; a&s;&s;uring him, that if he readily con|form'd,
there was nothing he might not expect
from him: to which Don <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> who with force
con&s;train'd him&s;elf, reply'd only, that he &s;hould o|bey
his Orders. The Marqui&s;s neglected nothing
to di&s;gui&s;e his Years to <HI>Leonora,</HI> but made u&s;e of
Powder and Perfumes, Diamonds and Embroidery,
and &s;aid all the obliging things to her he could
think on; which &s;he reply'd to with Mode&s;ty. The
Vi&s;it he made was &s;hort, and as &s;oon as he got
home, he &s;ent both <HI>Leonora</HI> and <HI>Matilda</HI> &s;ome very
fine Jewels, which they look'd over with Sorrow;
when <HI>Leonora</HI> ob&s;erved, in a little Box of Emeralds,
<PB N="194" REF="203">
a Billet, which &s;he open'd, and which contain'd
the&s;e words:</P>

<P>They undre&s;s'd them&s;elves in the Evening, and
fail'd not to be in the Garden at the time appoint|ed,
accompany'd by Don <HI>Franci&s;co,</HI> who let in the
two Lovers, muffled up in their Clokes, by a Door
he kept a Key of; who &s;eeing their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es veil'd,
conducted them, with a great deal of &s;ilence, to
the end of a Street, where a Coach waited for
them, that carried them to the Port, where a Sloop
attended, to row them to the Ship. As &s;oon as they
were aboard, the Ma&s;ter led them into his Cabbin,
weigh'd Anchor, and with a fre&s;h Gale &s;ail'd for
<HI>Venice.</HI> Our Lovers, placed by their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, ex|pre&s;s'd
an extraordinary Joy and Acknowledgment;

Thoughts, and not being able to &s;ee them unea&s;y,
in his amu&s;ing Temper, propo&s;ed to divert them
from their Spleen, by telling them a Story, &s;ince
they were not for lying down; at which they
&s;eem'd very much plea&s;ed, and going upon the
Deck, becau&s;e it was a clear Moon&s;hine-Night,

<PB N="195" REF="204">
<HEAD>The Story of Young-and-Hand&s;ome.</HEAD>
<P>HERETOFORE there liv'd a Fairy, who
&s;trove as much as po&s;&s;ible to re&s;i&s;t the Force
of Love, but all in vain; for that little God, with|out
employing the utmo&s;t of his power, render'd
her &s;en&s;ible of it. A young Prince arrived at her
Court, who was both amiable and renown'd for the
great Actions he had done, which were not un|known
to the Fairy.</P>
<P>This young Prince's Per&s;on an&s;wer'd &s;o well the
great Reputation he had gain'd, that the Fairy,
who was not proof again&s;t &s;o many Charms, in a
&s;hort time accepted of his Vows. The Fairy was
beautiful, and he really in love; &s;he married him,
and by that Marriage made him a rich and mo&s;t
powerful Monarch. After this Union, they lived a
long time happy; but the Fairy growing old, the
King's Love, tho he was as much in Years him&s;elf,
began to fall off, and he was taken with &s;ome of
the young Beauties of the Court: at which the
Fairy conceiv'd a Jealou&s;y, that proved fatal to
many of her Rivals.</P>
<P>The Fairy, by this Marriage, had only one Daugh|ter,
who was the Object of her Tenderne&s;s, and
in all re&s;pects de&s;erving of it. The $airies, her
Relations, at her Birth endow'd her with a &s;pright|ly
Wit, a mo&s;t bewitching Beauty, and Graces more
engaging than both, with a Voice that captivated
all that heard it. Her Shape was perfectly fine,
and her Air noble; her Hair was a curious black,
her Mouth little, but always graced with Smiles,
her Teeth were of a &s;urprizing Whitene&s;s, her Eyes
black, lively, and &s;parkling, and her Looks &s;o ten|der
and piercing, that they created Love in all
<PB N="196" REF="205">
Hearts: whereupon the Fairy named her <HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome,</HI>
&s;u&s;pending all other Gifts, that &s;he might
judge in the end what &s;ort of Happine&s;s &s;he might
promi&s;e a Daughter &s;o dear to her.</P>
<P>The Infidelity of the King was a continual Af|fliction
to the Fairy; the Misfortune of not being
beloved, made her think, that the greate&s;t of all
Ble&s;&s;ings was to be always amiable. This Happi|ne&s;s,
after a thou&s;and Reflections, &s;he endowed
<HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome</HI> with, who was then about &s;ix|teen
Years old, when the Fairy u&s;ed all her Know|ledge,
that &s;he &s;hould always remain the &s;ame as
&s;he was at that time. What Ble&s;&s;ing could &s;he be|&s;tow
more valuable?</P>
<P>The Fairy buried the King her Husband, and
tho he had been fal&s;e to her a long time, was &s;o
&s;en&s;ibly grieved at his Death, that &s;he re&s;olved to
leave her Dominions, and retire to a Ca&s;tle &s;he
had built in a de&s;art Country, which &s;he had &s;ur|rounded
with a va&s;t Fore&s;t, &s;o that only &s;he her|&s;elf
could find the way to it.</P>
<P>This Re&s;olution afflicted <HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome,</HI> who
was loth to part with the Fairy, who commanded
her ab&s;olutely to &s;tay; but before her Departure
&s;he recall'd into her Palace, which was very fine,
all the Plea&s;ures and Diver&s;ions &s;he had bani&s;h'd &s;o
long, and therewith compo&s;ed the Court of <HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome;</HI>
who in that agreeable Company was
comforted &s;ome time after, for the Ab&s;ence of the
Fairy. All the Kings and Princes, who thought
them&s;elves worthy of plea&s;ing her, came in Crouds
to the Court of <HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome,</HI> to endeavour
by their Sedulities and Love, to render &s;o lovely a
Prince&s;s &s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P>Nothing ever equalled the Magnificence and
Charms of her Palace, there were every day &s;ome
new Entertainments; every body was happy, but
tho&s;e Lovers who adored without hope, for &s;he
look'd favourably on none: but as they had the
<PB N="197" REF="206">
happine&s;s to &s;ee her often, the mo&s;t indifferent
Looks were &s;ufficient to &s;tay them for ever.</P>
<P>One day <HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome,</HI> content with the
Happine&s;s and Sweets of her Reign, was walking
in a plea&s;ant Wood, attended only by &s;ome of her
Nymphs, to ta&s;te the Delights of Solitude; where
&s;he amu&s;ed her&s;elf with plea&s;ing Thoughts, which
brought her in&s;en&s;ibly into a delicate Meadow, en|amelled
with Flowers of various Colours.</P>
<P>Her Eyes were engaged with a thou&s;and diffe|rent
and agreeable Objects, when perceiving a
Flock of Sheep feeding in the Meadow, by the
Side of a Brook, which by its Waters rolling a|mong&s;t
the Pebbles, made &s;oft Murmurings; &s;he
di&s;cover'd a young Shepherd, &s;haded by an Holt of
Trees, laid a&s;leep by the Brook-&s;ide, with his
Crook &s;et again&s;t a Tree, and a pretty little Dog,
which &s;eem'd to be rather his Ma&s;ter's Favourite,
than the Keeper of the Flock by his &s;ide.</P>
<P><HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome</HI> went to the Brook, and look|ed
on the Shepherd; but how fatal was that &s;ight!
for Love &s;leeping in the Arms of <HI>P&s;yche</HI> never ap|pear'd
with &s;o many Charms. The young Fairy
&s;topt, being unable to re&s;i&s;t &s;ome Emotions of Ad|miration,
which were &s;oon follow'd by more ten|der
Sentiments. The young Shepherd &s;eem'd to
be about eighteen Years of Age, very proper and
well &s;haped, and his Hair, which was brown, and
curled naturally in large flowing Rings, adorn'd a
mo&s;t beautiful Face. His Eyes, which were then
clo&s;ed, concealed from the Fairy new Darts, which
Love pre&s;erved to redouble her Tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome</HI> felt an unu&s;ual Di&s;turbance in
her Brea&s;t, and had not power to leave the Place,
but took too much plea&s;ure in tho&s;e her Senti|ments,
to &s;eek to oppo&s;e them; &s;he loved tenderly,
and thought at that time only of being loved a|gain:
&s;he dur&s;t not awake the Shepherd, for fear
of di&s;covering her Di&s;order, but taking a plea&s;ure
in revealing her Pa&s;&s;ion in a more gallant and a|greeable
<PB N="198" REF="207">
manner, render'd her&s;elf invi&s;ible, to
divert her&s;elf with the Amazement &s;he de&s;ign'd to
put him into. Some charming Mu&s;ick was pre|&s;ently
heard, with a Symphony that &s;truck the
Heart it&s;elf. The&s;e delightful Sounds awaken'd
<HI>Alidorus,</HI> which was the Shepherd's Name, who
then thought it only an agreeable Dream: But how
great was his Surprize, when ri&s;ing off the Gra&s;s
where he was laid, he found him&s;elf in a &s;ine and
magnificent Habit, of yellow Velvet trimm'd with
Silver; his Scrip embroider'd with Cyphers of
<HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome,</HI> and tied with a Scarf of Flow|ers;
his Crook of curious Work, adorn'd with
Jewels of &s;everal Colours, which form'd nice De|vices;
and his Hat made of Jonquils and blue Hia|$ynths,
interwoven with great Art!</P>
<P>Plea&s;ed and &s;urprized with his new Dre&s;s, he
view'd him&s;elf in the Brook, while <HI>Young-and-Hand|&s;ome</HI>
was in a thou&s;and Apprehen&s;ions, le&s;t he &s;hould
undergo the &s;ame hard Fate with the beautiful <HI>Nar|$$&s;&s;us.</HI>
But how much greater was his A&s;toni&s;h|ment,
when he &s;aw his Sheep fleeced with Silk as
white as Snow, in&s;tead of their ordinary Wool,
and bedeck'd with Branches of Ribbons of various
Colours; and his favourite Ewe, &s;et off like the
re&s;t, come skipping over the Gra&s;s, as if &s;he was
proud of her Attire; and his little Dog with a Col|lar
of Gold, &s;et with &s;mall Emeralds, which com|po&s;ed
the&s;e Ver&s;es:
<Q><L>How pa$ts the Heart, &s;eiz'd with an am'rous Fire,</L>
<L>Whe$ it is &s;$$r$h'd by la&s;ting Flames of Love?</L>
<L>Tho to b$ hand&s;ome can create De&s;ire,</L>
<L>Yet to be happy, we mu&s;t con&s;tant prove.</L></Q></P>
<P>The young Shepherd judged by the&s;e Ver&s;es, that
he was obliged to Love for this agreeable Adven|ture.
The Sun was then &s;et, and <HI>Alidorus,</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;s'd
with mo&s;t plea&s;ing Thoughts, return'd to his Cab|bin,
in which he ob&s;erved no Change without;
<PB N="199" REF="208">
but was hardly enter'd, before a delicious Odour
inform'd him there was &s;omething new. He found
his little Hut hung with a Ti&s;&s;ue of Je&s;&s;amin and
Orange-Flowers, the Curtains of his Bed the &s;ame,
rai&s;ed up with Garlands of Lillies and Ro&s;es, &s;up|ported
in their Beauty by an agreeable Fre&s;hne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Floor was China, whereon were repre&s;ented
the Stories of all the Godde&s;&s;es who fell in love
with Shepherds; <HI>Alidorus,</HI> who had a great deal of
Wit, ob&s;erved it: for the Shepherds in that Coun|try
were not common Shepherds, &s;ome of them be|ing
de&s;cended from Kings and great Princes; as
<HI>Alidorus</HI> derived his Origin from a Prince that go|vern'd
tho&s;e People before they were &s;ubject to the
Fairies.</P>
<P>Till then the young Shepherd had been in&s;en&s;i|ble,
but now he began to perceive that his young
Heart, tho he could fix on no Object, burnt to &s;ur|render;
he almo&s;t died with Impatience to know
the Godde&s;s or Fairy that &s;hew'd him &s;uch favour|able
Marks of her Tenderne&s;s. He walk'd about
in the greate&s;t Unea&s;ine&s;s imaginable, and knew
not what to think; Night came on, a fine Illumi|nation
appear'd in his Cabbin, and his Mu&s;ings were
interrupted by a delicious and &s;tately Supper that
was &s;et before him: &startq;What, <HI>&s;aid the Shepherd &s;mi|ling,</HI>
always new Plea&s;ures, and nobody to partake
of them with me!&endq; His little Dog would have
play'd with him, but he was too much taken up to
an&s;wer his Care&s;&s;es; when &s;itting down, a little
<HI>Cupid</HI> pre&s;ented him Drink in a Cup made of one
&s;ingle Diamond. He ask'd the little Love &s;ome
Que&s;tions, who, in&s;tead of an&s;wering them, drew
&s;ome Arrows, which as &s;oon as they reached the
Shepherd, were changed into a &s;weet-&s;melling Wa|ter.
<HI>Alidorus</HI> comprehended by the&s;e little Tricks,
that the little Rogue was order'd not to explain
this My&s;tery. As &s;oon as <HI>Alidorus</HI> had $one, the
little <HI>Cupid</HI> flew away, and the Table vani&s;h'd.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="209">
Afterwards he heard a charming Symphony,
which creating a thou&s;and tender Sentiments in
his Heart, his Impatience to know to whom he
was obliged for &s;o much Plea&s;ure, continually in|crea&s;ed;
when with a great deal of Satisfaction he
heard the&s;e words &s;ung:
<Q><LG>
<L>Tell me, <HI>Cupid,</HI> what bright Form</L>
<L>Will wound the Swain I love;</L>
<L>Say what Charms I mu&s;t put on,</L>
<L>That may his Pa&s;&s;ion move.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My con&s;tant Love, let him not doubt,</L>
<L>Tho that won't always plea&s;e;</L>
<L>Great God incre$&s;e my Stock of Charms,</L>
<L>My Truth will give me ea&s;e.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>&startq;Come then, charming Object, <HI>cry'd the Shepherd,</HI>
and by your Pre&s;ence compleat my Felicity: I
believe you too lovely ever to be capable of be|ing
unfaithful to your Charms.&endq; No An&s;wer was
return'd, the Mu&s;ick cea&s;ed &s;oon after, and a pro|found
Silence reign'd, which invited the Shepherd
to take a &s;weet Repo&s;e.</P>
<P>He threw him&s;elf upon his Bed, where he &s;lept
but little, agitated by his Impa$ience and growing
Pa&s;&s;ion. At Day-break he awaken'd by the har|monious
Warblings of the Birds, aro&s;e and drove
his Flock to the &s;ame place, where the day before
his Good-Fortune began. He was no &s;ooner &s;at
down by the Brook-&s;ide, but a Pavillion, of a
bright-green and gold-colour'd Stuff, was fa&s;ten'd
to the Boughs of the Trees, to &s;ecure him from
the Scorchings of the Sun. His Pavillion, Flock,
and Habit, &s;urprized all the young Shepherds and
Shepherde&s;&s;es about him; they came in great ha&s;te,
and ask'd him, with earne&s;tne&s;s, the rea&s;on of tho&s;e
&s;trange Alterations: and <HI>Alidorus</HI> &s;miling, told them
all that had happen'd. There was not a Shepherd
but what was jealous, nor Shepherde&s;s but blu&s;h'd
<PB N="201" REF="210">
with Rage and Envy, &s;ince there was &s;carce one
of the latter, who had not form'd De&s;igns of gain|ing
the Heart of this lovely Shepherd; and a God|de&s;s,
or a Fairy, were either of them too dange|rous
Rivals.</P>
<P><HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome,</HI> who never lo&s;t &s;ight of her
Shepherd, &s;uffer'd the Conver&s;ation of the Shep|herde&s;&s;es
with impatience; &s;ome of them were
charming, and a lovely Shepherde&s;s may prove a
formidable Rival to a Godde&s;s her&s;elf. But <HI>Alido|rus</HI>'s
Indifference, and their being obliged to leave
that Shepherd, and drive their Flocks further on
the Meadow, encouraged the young Fairy.</P>
<P>Some time after, when none but Shepherds were
with <HI>Alidorus,</HI> a delicious Entertainment appear'd
on a white marble Table, with Seats of Greens a|round
it, of which <HI>Alidorus</HI> and tho&s;e Shepherds
partook; when &s;itting down at the Table, they
found them&s;elves clothed in magnificent Habits, but
not &s;o fine as <HI>Alidorus,</HI> who &s;hined again with Jew|els.
A ru&s;tick Mu&s;ick, but very fine, echoed all
around, and the&s;e words were &s;ung:
<Q><L><HI>Alidorus</HI>'s Happine&s;s confe&s;s,</L>
<L>By whom Love his Pow'r has &s;hewn;</L>
<L>Swains that know his killing Charms,</L>
<L>Regard the Choice my Heart does own.</L></Q></P>
<P>The Shepherds Amazement increa&s;ed every mi|nute,
and &s;ome Shepherde&s;&s;es, drawn by the Mu|&s;ick,
coming to the Brook-&s;ide, they began a very
agreeable Country-Dance. The young Fairy, who
was always pre&s;ent, but invi&s;ible, a&s;&s;umed, with &s;ix
of her Nymphs, the Habits of Shepherde&s;&s;es, dre&s;s'd
with Garlands of Flowers, with their Crooks very
prettily wrought; at which time <HI>Young-and-Hand|&s;ome,</HI>
who had on an Head-dre&s;s of Jonquils, which
had the mo&s;t agreeable effect imaginable on her fine
black Hair, appear'd the mo&s;t beautiful Per&s;on in
the World.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="211">
The Arrival of the&s;e charming Shepherde&s;&s;es &s;ur|prized
all the A&s;&s;embly; all the Beauties there con|ceiving
Jealou&s;ies, and the Shepherds &s;eeking, with
great earne&s;tne&s;s, to pay them the utmo&s;t Re&s;pect.</P>
<P><HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome,</HI> who was not known to be
a Fairy, received all the Honours, and, like the
Load&s;tone, attracted all their Hearts; for there the
mo&s;t &s;incere Homages were paid to Beauty alone,
which flatter'd <HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome</HI> with the ef|fect
of hers, &s;ince there her Rank had not the
lea&s;t &s;hare.</P>
<P>For <HI>Alidorus,</HI> as &s;oon as &s;he appeared, forgetting
the Love a Godde&s;s, or a Fairy, had for him, flew
to <HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome,</HI> and approached her with the
be&s;t Grace in the World: &startq;Come, charming Shep|herde&s;s,
<HI>&s;aid h$,</HI> accept of a Place more worthy of
you; &s;o delicate a Per&s;on is too much &s;uperiour to
the other Beauties, to &s;tay intermixed with them.&endq;
Then offering his Hand, <HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome,</HI> plea&s;ed
with the Sentiments &s;he had in&s;pired the young
Shepherd with, &s;uffered her&s;elf to be led by him.
<HI>Alidorus</HI> conducted her under the Pavilion, where
&s;ome young Shepherds, by <HI>Alidorus</HI>'s Orders, brought
Bundles of Flowers and Greens, and rai&s;ed a kind of
Throne, whereon they placed <HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome.</HI>
The lovely young Shepherd laid him&s;elf at her feet,
the Nymphs &s;at by her, and the re&s;t of the Company
made a Ring, where every one &s;eated them&s;elves
according to their Inclination.</P>
<P>This Circle of Beauties was a mo&s;t agreeable &s;ight,
where the purling Streams and the harmonious
Symphony, intermixed with the Warblings of the
Birds, which flock'd about them, made a compleat
Concert. Shepherds came in Troops to make their
Court to <HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome;</HI> and one among them,
who was called <HI>Iphis,</HI> going up to the young Fairy,
&startq;Though this Seat whereon you are placed by <HI>Ali|dorus,
&s;aid he to her,</HI> is very agreeable, yet not|with&s;tanding
it is very dangerous.&endq; &startq;I believe, <HI>re|ply'd
the Fairy with a Smile, capable of captivating all
<PB N="203" REF="212">
Hearts,</HI> the Shepherde&s;&s;es of this Hamlet will hard|ly
pardon in me the Preference which <HI>Alidorus</HI>
&s;eems to give me, before &s;o many Beauties much
more de&s;erving.&endq; &startq;No, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Iphis, our Shep|herde&s;&s;es
are more ju&s;t, but a Godde&s;s loves
<HI>Al$dorus.</HI>&endq; Then he telling her the whole Adven|ture
of that lovely Shepherd, and having made an
end of that Relation, the young Fairy turning her|&s;elf
towards <HI>Alidorus,</HI> &s;aid, with a gracious Smile, &startq;I
will not create my&s;elf &s;o formidable an Enemy as
the Godde&s;s, by whom you are beloved: Without
doubt &s;he hath not de&s;tined me the Place I po&s;|&s;e&s;s,
therefore I &s;hall &s;urrender it up to her;&endq;
and in &s;aying the&s;e words, &s;he got up. &startq;Stay, <HI>&s;aid</HI>
Alidorus, <HI>looking on her tenderly, and &s;topping her;</HI>
&s;tay, beautiful Shepherde&s;s, there is no Godde&s;s,
who&s;e Tenderne&s;s I would not &s;acrifice to the
Plea&s;ure of adoring you: and that Godde&s;s <HI>Iphis</HI>
hath told you of, is not very &s;ubtle, at lea&s;t in
Love-Affairs, to permit me the &s;ight of you.&endq;
<HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome</HI> could not then return any An|&s;wer,
for they took her out ju&s;t at that very
moment to dance; never any Per&s;on acquitted
her&s;elf with &s;o good a Grace. And for the lovely
Shepherd, he even &s;urpa&s;s'd him&s;elf. None of all
the magnificent Entertainment at the Court of
<HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome</HI> ever gave her &s;o much plea&s;ure
as this rural A&s;&s;embly; for Love embeli&s;hes all
Places, where we can &s;ee the Per&s;ons we de&s;ire.</P>
<P><HI>Alidorus</HI> &s;ound his Love increa&s;e every moment,
and &s;wore a thou&s;and times to &s;acrifice all the God|de&s;&s;es
and Fairies in the World to the tender Pa&s;|&s;ion
his Shepherde&s;s in&s;pired in him. <HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome</HI>
was charm'd with the&s;e Sentiments of her
belo$ed Shepherd, but was willing to make further
tryal of his Pa&s;&s;ion. <HI>Iphis</HI> was amiable, and if <HI>Ali|dorus</HI>
had not been there, without doubt had had the
Preference. The young Fairy &s;poke to him twice
or thrice in a favourable manner, and dan$ed often
with him.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="213">
At which <HI>Alidorus</HI> conceived a Jealou&s;y as vio|lent
as his Love, which was not unob&s;erved by
<HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome;</HI> who thinking her&s;elf &s;ure of
her Shepherd's Heart, forbore to torment him, and
&s;poke no more to <HI>Iphis</HI> all that day, but ca&s;t mo&s;t
favourable Looks on <HI>Alidorus,</HI> which of them&s;elves
were able to vanqui&s;h the mo&s;t In&s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P>At night this fair A&s;&s;embly broke up with Re|gret,
when <HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome</HI> would not permit
any of the Shepherds to accompany her, but was
follow'd by a thou&s;and Sighs; however, &s;he pro|mi&s;ed
<HI>Alidorus</HI> to meet him the next day in the
Meadow, and then went away with her Nymphs.
The Shepherds let them go, hoping, by following
at a di&s;tance, to know what Hamlet tho&s;e Divine
Per&s;ons belong'd to; but as &s;oon as they had gain'd
a little Wood, which deprived their Followers of
the &s;ight of them, &s;he and her Nymphs di&s;appear'd,
and amu&s;ed them&s;el$es &s;ome time, to &s;ee the Shep|herds
&s;earching out the Path they believed they had
gone: <HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome</HI> ob&s;erved with plea&s;ure,
that <HI>Alidorus</HI> &s;eem'd the mo&s;t earne&s;t. <HI>Iphis</HI> was in
de&s;pair, that they &s;tay'd &s;o long before they pur|&s;ued
them; and a great many other Shepherds,
who&s;e Hearts the Nymphs had captivated, &s;pent
mo&s;t of the Night to find them out.</P>
<P><HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome</HI> return'd to her Palace, where
(tho a Fairy may have many Occa&s;ions to be ab|&s;ent)
&s;he found all her Lovers very unea&s;y, that
they had not &s;een her all that day, but none of
them dur&s;t reproach her; for tho&s;e who were her
Lovers, were forced to be &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and re&s;pectful,
or leave her Court: So &s;evere was &s;he, that they
dur&s;t not tell her of their Tenderne&s;s; but hoped
only to gain her by their A&s;&s;iduities, Re&s;pect, and
Con&s;tancy.</P>
<P><HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome</HI> &s;eem'd to take very little no|tice
of any thing; &s;he eat but little, was often mu|&s;ing,
and the Princes her Admirers, who were
Ob&s;ervers of all her Actions, thought they heard
<PB N="205" REF="214">
her often &s;igh. She took leave of her Court be|times,
and retired to her Apartment; for when we
are to &s;ee again tho&s;e we love, every thing that
ob&s;tructs that Happine&s;s, &s;eems cold and trouble|&s;ome.</P>
<P>The young Fairy, with her Nymphs, were in|&s;tantly
at her beloved Shepherd's Cabbin, conceal'd
in a Cloud. He &s;eem'd very melancholy for not
finding out the way his Divine Shepherde&s;s had ta|ken,
but found his Cottage as charming as when
he left it; only ca&s;ting his Eyes on the Floor, he
perceiv'd it was chang'd, and in&s;tead of the Hi&s;to|ries
of Godde&s;&s;es, who were in love with Shep|herds,
he &s;aw terrible Examples of unfortunate
Lovers, who were not de&s;erving of the Tenderne&s;s
of tho&s;e Divinities.</P>
<P>&startq;You are in the right, <HI>cry'd the lovely Shepherd;</HI>
you are in the right, Godde&s;s; I de&s;erve your
Anger: But why &s;uffer'd you my Eyes to behold
a Shepherde&s;s &s;o lovely? Alas! what Deity was
able to with&s;tand her Charms?&endq;</P>
<P><HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome,</HI> who was then in the Cot|tage
when <HI>Alidorus</HI> pronounced the&s;e words, felt
all her Softne&s;s and Tenderne&s;s redoubled. There
appear'd another magnificent Supper, which <HI>Alido|rus</HI>
made not &s;o good a u&s;e of as that of the Night
before: He was too much in love, and at the &s;ame
time jealous; he often recall'd in his mind his
Shepherde&s;s, her &s;peaking to <HI>Iphis;</HI> but the Promi&s;e
&s;he made him, that he &s;hould &s;ee her again the
next day, &s;omewhat mitigated his Pain.</P>
<P>The little Love waited on him all the time, but
<HI>Alidorus,</HI> wholly taken up with his Di&s;quiet, &s;aid
not one word to him. The Table di&s;appear'd, and
a young Child making up to <HI>Alidorus,</HI> pre&s;ented him
with two Boxes, in which were magnificent Pic|tures,
and then flew away.</P>
<P>The Shepherd immediately open'd one of them,
wherein was the Picture of a young Lady of a
tran&s;cendent Beauty; under which the&s;e words
were writ in Letters of Gold&punc;</P>
<DIV3>
<PB N="206" REF="215">

<P>&startq;Who but he, who hath &s;een my Shepherde&s;s

<P>She was painted in the &s;ame Dre&s;s he &s;aw her
in that day, with her Head-dre&s;s of Flowers; and
&s;o tran&s;ported was he with his Love, that 'twas a
long while before he perceiv'd the&s;e Words, which
were writ under it:
<Q>Forget her Charms, or thy Love will be fatal to thee.</Q></P>
<P>&startq;Alas! <HI>cry'd</HI> Alido$$$: what Happine&s;s is there

<HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome.</HI> That fine Picture <HI>Alidorus</HI>
de&s;pi&s;ed was an imaginary one, by which the
young Fairy had a mind to try whether her Shep|herd
would prefer her to &s;o beautiful a Per&s;on,
who &s;eem'd to be a Godde&s;s, or a Fairy; but &s;a|tisfy'd
with his Love, &s;he return'd to her Palace,
after &s;he had, by a Signal, call'd her Nymphs to|gether,
who were gone to &s;ee after their Lovers.</P>
<P>Some of them were very well plea&s;ed with
theirs, having found them thinking and &s;peaking
of them with Pa&s;&s;ion; others again were di&s;&s;ati&s;|fy'd
with the Effects of their Beauty, having found
their Shepherds a&s;leep, who in the day-time ap|pear'd
very amorous, but were not in love enough
to keep them waking all night.</P>
<P>The young Shepherde&s;s went to bed when &s;he
arrived at her Palace, plea&s;ed with the Love of
her Shepherd, and agitated only with the &s;weet
Impatience of &s;eeing him again. For <HI>Alidorus,</HI> he
<PB N="207" REF="216">
&s;lept a little; and without di&s;quieting him&s;elf with
the Menaces he read under the Pictures, thought
of nothing but the Meadow, where he hoped to
&s;ee his Shepherde&s;s the next day, which he thought
approach'd too &s;low.</P>
<P>He drove his Flock to the fortunate Place where
he fir&s;t &s;aw <HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome,</HI> his little Dog watch|ing

<P><HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome</HI> was that day again&s;t her will

came from neighbouring Princes. Never were Au|diences

&s;pent in tho&s;e trouble&s;ome Ceremonies, and the young
Fairy &s;uffer'd as much as her Shepherd, who lan|gui&s;h'd

&s;et, and <HI>Alidorus,</HI> who thought he &s;hould not &s;ee
his Divine Shepherde&s;s that day, was in the greate&s;t
Grief imaginable: He &s;igh'd and bewail'd his Ill|fortune
a thou&s;and times, made the&s;e Ver&s;es on her
Ab&s;ence, and with the Iron of his Crook engraved
them on a young Elm.</P>

He had hardly done, before <HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome</HI>

ran, or rather flew towards <HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome,</HI>
who receiv'd him with a charming Smile, capable
to create a Happine&s;s in Gods them&s;elves.</P>
<P>He &s;poke to her of his Love with an Ardour

he had engraved on the Tree, and was delighted
both with the Wit and Tenderne&s;s of her young

before, and offer'd a thou&s;and times to follow her

Fairy more, than if he had u&s;ed the mo&s;t pathe|tick
Eloquence. <HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome</HI> rai&s;ed him up,
and he found him&s;elf clothed in a &s;tately Habit;
then the Fairy touching the Ground with her
Crook, there appear'd a magnificent Chariot, drawn
by twelve white Hor&s;es very beautiful, and har|ne&s;s'd
four on a brea&s;t. <HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome</HI> got into
the Chariot, and made her lovely Shepherd &s;it by
her; and as &s;oon as the Nymphs had taken their
places, the Hor&s;es, which had no need of any
Guide to obey the Fairy's Intentions, carried them
pre&s;ently to a Ca&s;tle <HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome</HI> took great
delight in, which &s;he had embeli&s;h'd with all her

<P><PB N="209" REF="218">
The young Fairy and her happy Lover arrived
in a great Court, &s;urrounded by Pali&s;adoes brea&s;t|high,
cover'd over with Je&s;&s;amin and Citrons, by
which there ran a fine River, on the other &s;ide of
which were Meadows almo&s;t out of &s;ight; where
the &s;ame River &s;ported in &s;everal Meanders, as if
loth to leave &s;o charming an Abode.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;tle was much more to be admir'd for its
Architecture than Extent; there were twelve A|partments
in it, each of which had its different
Excellency, they being large, but not capable of
containing the whole Court of <HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome,</HI>
which was both numerous and magnificent.</P>
<P>The young Fairy always came to this Ca&s;tle when
&s;he had a mind to be retired, attended only by
favourite Nymphs, and &s;ome of the Officers of her
Hou&s;hold. She conducted her Shepherd into the
Apartment of Myrtles, where all the Furniture con|&s;i&s;ted
of Myrtle, always in flower, interwoven with
&s;o much Art, as &s;hew'd the Fairy's delcate Ta&s;te in
the mo&s;t &s;imple things. Thus all the Apartments
were furni&s;h'd with Flowers, which perfumed the
Air with their Fragrancy.</P>
<P><HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome</HI> had bani&s;h'd thence Winter,
and never permitted the Heats of Summer to in|trude
on &s;o agreeable a Place, but to enjoy with
more plea&s;ure the Beauty of the Baths; which A|partment
was made of blue and white Porphyry
finely wrought, with Baths of different Sizes and
Forms: that which <HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome</HI> bath'd in,
was one entire Topaz of exqui&s;ite Beauty, over
which was a Canopy of yellow and &s;ilver Brocade,
adorn'd with Pearls, &s;upported by four Pillars of
Amethi&s;t. <HI>Alidorus,</HI> who was entirely taken up
with the Happine&s;s of looking on his lovely Fairy,

hardly any of all the&s;e Wonders. A tender and
plea&s;ant Conver&s;ation enchanted the&s;e happy Lovers
a long time in the Apartment of Myrtles; a magni|ficent
Supper was &s;erved up in the Hall of Jonquils,
<PB N="210" REF="219">

<P><HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome,</HI> who forgot to return to her

Apartment of Narci&s;&s;us's; and <HI>Alidorus,</HI> tran&s;ported
with Love, was a long while before he could ta&s;te
the Sweets of Sleep in the Apartment of Myrtles,
where the Nymphs conducted him after Supper:
and that Night the Fairy, who was not willing to

not till Day-break.</P>
<P><HI>Alidorus,</HI> who long'd with impatience to &s;ee the
charming Fairy again, waited &s;ome time for that
happy moment in the Hall of Jonquils; he had neg|lected
nothing in his D$e&s;s, that could add to his
natural Graces and Beauties: and <HI>Young-and-Hand|&s;ome,</HI>
who appear'd more charming than <HI>Venus,</HI> &s;pent

the Gardens of the Ca&s;tle, the Beauties of which

<P>They had a &s;mall Regale in a delightful Wood,
where <HI>Alidorus</HI> for &s;ome time enjoy'd the Plea&s;ure
of declaring his Pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome,</HI> who
returning that Night to her Palace, promi&s;ed <HI>Ali|dorus</HI>
to come again the next Day. Never was any
Ab&s;ence of &s;o &s;hort a time &s;o much regretted; the
Shepherd wi&s;h'd pa&s;&s;ionately to have follow'd the
young Fairy: &s;he being willing to conceal her
Tenderne&s;s from her Court, de&s;ired him to &s;tay in
the Ca&s;tle of Flowers. None ever enter'd this Ca|&s;tle
without her Order, and for her Nymphs, &s;he
fear'd not their di&s;covering her Secrets; for tho&s;e

ask'd <HI>Alidorus</HI> for his little Dog, to take him along
with her, for what plea&s;es tho&s;e we love, is always
dear to us.</P>
<P>After the young Fairy was gone, the Shepherd,
to entertain his Di&s;quiet rather than divert it, went
farther into the Wood, to dream on his adorable
<PB N="211" REF="220">
Fairy; and in a little Mead, that was in the mid&s;t
of the Wood, enamelled with Flowers, and water'd
by a delicate Spring, he &s;aw his Flock skipping on
the Gra&s;s, and guarded by &s;ix young Slaves of good
Mien, clothed in Habits of Blue and Gold, with
Collars and Chains of the &s;ame: his favourite Ewe
&s;oon knew her Ma&s;ter, and came to him; <HI>Alidorus</HI>
care&s;s'd her, and was &s;en&s;ibly touch'd at the Care
<HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome</HI> had for him.</P>
<P>The young Slaves &s;hew'd <HI>Alidorus</HI> their Hut,
which was ju&s;t by, at the end of a &s;hady Alley;
which little Abode was built all of Cedar, in which
there appear'd the Cyphers of <HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome</HI> and
<HI>Alidorus</HI> mix'd together, with this In&s;cription in Let|ters
of Gold, on a large Turquoize:
<Q><L>How plea&s;ant is the &s;weet Abode,</L>
<L>Where my Charmer's Flock doth feed?</L>
<L>By the Shepherd I'm belov'd,</L>
<L>In Bli&s;s no God can me exceed.</L></Q></P>
<P>The lovely Shepherd return'd to the Ca&s;tle of
Flowers, charm'd with the Bounties of the young
Fairy, who the next day came again to her happy
Lover, as &s;he promi&s;ed: How great was his Joy to
&s;ee her again! All that the young Fairy had done
before, never gave him &s;o great a Plea&s;ure. She
&s;pent almo&s;t all her time in the Ca&s;tle of Flowers,
and &s;eldom appear'd at her Court; where the Prin|ces
her Lovers felt a mortal Grief, &s;ince all was &s;a|crificed
to the happy <HI>Alidorus.</HI></P>
<P>But it was impo&s;&s;ible for &s;o great a Felicity to la&s;t
long without &s;ome Di&s;a&s;ter. Another Fairy had &s;een
the lovely Shepherd, and found her Heart &s;en&s;ible
of his Charms.</P>
<P>One Evening, when <HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome</HI> was gone
to her Court, <HI>Alidorus,</HI> taken up with his Love, &s;at
mu&s;ing in the Hall of Jonquils; when hearing a
little noi&s;e at one of the Windows, and looking
that way, he perceiv'd a great Light, and &s;oon after
&s;aw on a Table, ju&s;t by where he &s;at, a little Wo|man,
<PB N="212" REF="221">
about half a Yard high, very old, with Hair
as white as Snow, and an old-fa&s;hion'd Ruff and
Fardingale.</P>
<P>&startq;I am the Fairy <HI>Mordicant, &s;aid &s;he to the Shepherd;</HI>
and come to pronounce to you a Happine&s;s, grea|ter
than that of being beloved by <HI>Young-and-Hand|&s;ome.</HI>&endq;
&startq;What Happine&s;s can that be? <HI>&s;aid</HI> Alido|rus
<HI>to her in a di&s;dainful manner:</HI> The Gods them|&s;elves
enjoy not a greater Ble&s;&s;ing!&endq; &startq;'Tis that
of plea&s;ing me, <HI>a$&s;wer'd the old Fairy haughtily:</HI> I
love you, and my Power is greater than that of
<HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome,</HI> and almo&s;t equal to the Gods.
Leave this young Fairy for me; I will revenge
you of your Enemies, and on tho&s;e you would
prejudice.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Your Favours are of no u&s;e to me, <HI>reply'd the
charming Shepherd &s;miling;</HI> I have no Enemies, and
would hurt nobody: I am too well &s;atisfied with
my Good-fortune; and if the beautiful Fairy,
whom I adore, had been only a Shepherde&s;s, I
had been as happy with her in a Cottage, as I
am in the mo&s;t delightful Palace.&endq;</P>
<P>After the&s;e words, the wicked Fairy &s;eem'd all
on a &s;udden as large, as &s;he &s;eem'd at fir&s;t little,
and in di&s;appearing made a terrible noi&s;e. The next
day <HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome</HI> came again to the Ca&s;tle of
Flowers: <HI>Alidorus</HI> told her his Adventure; they both
knew the Fairy <HI>Mordicant</HI> to be both old and ugly,
and very &s;en&s;ible of Love. The two Lovers pa&s;s'd
a thou&s;and Je&s;ts on her Pa&s;&s;ion, and never made
them&s;elves a moment unea&s;y at the Effects of her
Revenge; for to be a &s;ucce&s;sful Lover, and think
of Misfortunes to come, is a thing unu&s;ual.</P>
<P>Eight Days after <HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome,</HI> and the
lovely Shepherd, went to take the Air in a fine
gilt Boat on that River, which &s;urrounded the Ca|&s;tle
of Flowers, follow'd by their &s;mall Court in
very fine Boats: <HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome</HI>'s was cover'd
with a Canopy of a light blue and &s;ilver Stuff, with
Oars of the &s;ame, attended by others full of Mu&s;i|cians.
<PB N="213" REF="222">
<HI>Alidorus,</HI> more in love than ever, regarded
nothing but <HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome,</HI> who&s;e Beauty that
day appear'd more charming to him than ever.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of their Plea&s;ures, twelve <HI>Syrens</HI>
aro&s;e out of the Water, follow'd &s;oon after by as
many <HI>Tritons;</HI> who ranging them&s;elves by the Boat|&s;ide
which <HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome</HI> was in, the <HI>Tritons,</HI>
with their concave Shells, perform'd a mo&s;t agree|able
Symphony, and the <HI>Syrens</HI> &s;ang mo&s;t alluring
Airs, which amu&s;ed the young Fairy and Shepherd
&s;ome time. <HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome,</HI> who was u&s;ed to
&s;uch-like Diver&s;ions, thought it had been prepared
by tho&s;e whom &s;he entru&s;ted with that Care; when
tho&s;e perfidious <HI>Tritons</HI> and <HI>Syrens,</HI> laying their hands
on the Boat, &s;unk down with it &s;uddenly.</P>
<P>All that <HI>Alidorus</HI> fear'd, was the danger the young
Fairy ran, and would have &s;wam towards her, but
the <HI>Tritons</HI> carried him away; while <HI>Young-and-Hand|&s;ome,</HI>
forced away by the <HI>Syrens,</HI> was put into her
own Palace.</P>
<P>As one Fairy has no power over another, the
jealous <HI>Mordicant</HI> limited her Revenge, in making
<HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome</HI> endure all the Torments a cruel
Ab&s;ence could create. In the mean time <HI>Alidorus</HI>
was convey'd by the <HI>Tritons</HI> into a terrible Ca&s;tle,
guarded by winged Dragons, where <HI>Mordicant</HI> re|&s;olved
to make the Shepherd an&s;wer her Love, or
revenge her&s;elf on his Di&s;dain. They put him into
a dark Room, where <HI>Mordicant,</HI> all &s;hining with
Jewels, came to him, and &s;poke of her Tenderne&s;s,
whom the Shepherd, in de&s;pair for being &s;eparated
from <HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome,</HI> treated with the utmo&s;t
Contempt and Di&s;dain.</P>
<P><HI>Mordicant</HI>'s Rage was unexpre&s;&s;ible, and her Love too
violent to de&s;troy the Per&s;on who was the cau&s;e of it.
She re&s;olved, after keeping <HI>Alidorus</HI> &s;ome time in this
mo&s;t di&s;mal Pri&s;on, to vanqui&s;h his Fidelity by new
Artifices; and to that end tran&s;ported him &s;uddenly
into a magnificent Palace, where he was &s;erved
with a Pomp no ways inferior to what he had &s;een
<PB N="214" REF="223">
in the Ca&s;tle of Flowers. She endeavour'd to di&s;&s;i|pate
his Grief by a thou&s;and agreeable Entertain|ments;
and the mo&s;t beautiful Nymphs in the
World, which compo&s;ed her Court, &s;eem'd to &s;trive
which &s;hould have the honour of plea&s;ing him.
They never &s;poke to <HI>Alidorus</HI> of the wicked Fairy's
Love; that faithful Shepherd langui&s;h'd in the mid&s;t
of Plea&s;ures, and was as much in de&s;pair for his
Ab&s;ence from <HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome,</HI> at all the mo&s;t
gallant Entertainments, as when in his di&s;mal
Pri&s;on.</P>
<P>In the mean time, <HI>Mordicant</HI> hoped, that the Ab|&s;ence
of <HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome,</HI> the continual Plea&s;ures
&s;he endeavour'd to amu&s;e him with, and the &s;ight
of &s;o many charming Per&s;ons, might in the end
render the Heart of the Shepherd unfaithful: her
De&s;ign, by pre&s;enting &s;o many beautiful Nymphs to
his View, was to find out what &s;ort of Beauty he
liked be&s;t, that &s;he might a&s;&s;ume a Form accord|ingly;
&s;ometimes &s;he appear'd a charming Brown,
and &s;ometimes a mo&s;t delicate Fair.</P>
<P>Love, who can do every thing, then &s;u&s;pended
her natural Cruelty; but her De&s;pair of not being
able to &s;hake the Con&s;tancy of <HI>Alidorus,</HI> rekindled
her Rage &s;o much, that &s;he re&s;olved to de&s;troy that
charming Shepherd, and to make him a Victim to
that un&s;haken Love he pre&s;erved for <HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome.</HI></P>
<P>One day, as &s;he was watching undi&s;cover'd, &s;he
heard <HI>Alidorus,</HI> who was leaning over the Bani&s;ters
of a Gallery that look'd towards the Sea, &s;ighing
grievou&s;ly, and making &s;uch tender and piercing
Complaints, as &s;hew'd the lively Pa&s;&s;ion he had for
the young Fairy; when tran&s;ported with Rage, &s;he
appear'd to him in her own natural Shape, and af|ter
having ca&s;t a thou&s;and Reproaches on him, con|fined
him in a Pri&s;on, and told him, that in three
days he &s;hould be &s;acrificed to her Hatred, by the
mo&s;t cruel Puni&s;hments a de&s;pi&s;ed Lover could in|flict.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="224">
<HI>Alidorus,</HI> for his part, valued not his Life, which
was in&s;upportable to him when ab&s;ent from <HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome;</HI>
and as he was &s;atisfied he had no|thing
to apprehend on her part from <HI>Mordicant</HI>'s
Anger, he expected, with Firmne&s;s of Mind, the
Death which had been pronounced.</P>
<P>In the mean time <HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome,</HI> who was
as faithful as her Shepherd, groan'd under the Grief
of lo&s;ing him. The <HI>Syrens,</HI> as &s;oon as they had
carried her to her Palace, di&s;appear'd; and the
young Fairy, not doubting but that it was the cruel
<HI>Mordicant</HI> that had carried <HI>Alidorus</HI> away, could not
di&s;gui&s;e from her Court the Grief which her Ten|derne&s;s
for her Shepherd, and her Lo&s;s of him,
created.</P>
<P>How many Kings were there jealous of the Mi&s;|fortunes
to which the wicked Fairy precipitated
<HI>Alidorus?</HI> What a Rage were the Princes her Ad|mirers
in, when they under&s;tood that they had a
Rival beloved, and &s;aw her &s;hed Tears for him!
Yet their Hopes revived at the lo&s;ing of him, for
they were &s;en&s;ible that <HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome</HI> knew as
well how to love, as to plea&s;e: They $edoubled
their Importunities, and every one flatter'd him&s;elf
with the plea&s;ing hope of &s;ucceeding that happy
Lover; when <HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome,</HI> equally afflicted
with the Ab&s;ence of <HI>Alidorus,</HI> and wearied with the
Love of his Rivals, left her Court, and retired to
the Ca&s;tle of Flowers.</P>
<P>The &s;ight of that charming Abode, where every
thing reminded her of her lovely Shepherd, aug|mented
her Grief and Tenderne&s;s; when one day,
as &s;he was walking in tho&s;e plea&s;ant Gardens, &startq;A|las!
<HI>&s;aid &s;he, looking on the Ornaments that embeli&s;h'd
it;</HI> I once took a plea&s;ure in you, but am now
too much taken up with my Grief, to think of
adding to your Beauties.&endq;</P>
<P>As &s;he made an end of the&s;e words, &s;he per|ceiv'd
the Flowers moved by a gentle Wind, and
&s;aw them ranged in a different manner; at fir&s;t
<PB N="216" REF="225">
they repre&s;ented the Cyphers of <HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome,</HI>
then other Cyphers, which &s;he knew not, and pre|&s;ently
afterwards they form'd di&s;tinct Letters, by
which <HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome</HI> read the&s;e Ver&s;es:
<Q><L>To grace this Place bid gentle <HI>Zephir</HI> wait,</L>
<L>With &s;pringing Gales the Flow'rs to con&s;ecrate;</L>
<L>For <HI>Flora</HI> every day, Exce&s;s he &s;hews,</L>
<L>And does his Care luxuriou&s;ly expo&s;e:</L>
<L>Ambitious more under your pow'r to live,</L>
<L>If you but &s;mile, much greater he will give.</L></Q></P>
<P>When &s;he had read the&s;e Ver&s;es, &s;he &s;aw in the
Air a God, who came to declare his Love to her,
drawn in a Chariot of Ro&s;es by white Vapours.
As &s;oon as the Chariot alighted on the Earth, the
God <HI>Zephirus</HI> got out of it, and approach'd the
young Fairy: He &s;poke to her with all the Grace
and Gallantry of a Deity, while the young Fairy,
tho plea&s;ed with &s;o glorious a Conque&s;t, an&s;wer'd
him like a faithful Lover. <HI>Zephirus,</HI> not at all di&s;|may'd
at the rigorous An&s;wers of <HI>Young-and-Hand|&s;ome,</HI>
but flattering him&s;elf with the Hopes of &s;oft|ning
her Heart by his gentle Approaches, made con|&s;tant
court to her, and neglected nothing that might
plea&s;e her: Which contributed much to the Glory
of <HI>Alidorus;</HI> thus to have a God for his Rival, and
to be preferred before him.</P>
<P>All this while <HI>Alidorus,</HI> that happy Mortal, was
ready to expire by the Fury of <HI>Mordicant;</HI> he had
been almo&s;t a year in that condition, when <HI>Zephirus,</HI>
who had no hopes of overcoming the Con&s;tancy of
<HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome,</HI> touch'd with the Tears &s;he
&s;hed, and finding her one day more melancholy
than ordinary, &s;aid to her, &startq;Since I am no longer
permitted, charming Fairy, to flatter my&s;elf with
the Happine&s;s of plea&s;ing you, I will however
contribute to your Felicity. Tell me what I
&s;hall do, <HI>continued he,</HI> to accompli&s;h it.&endq; &startq;Re&s;tore
me, <HI>Alidorus, reply'd the young Fairy with a Smile, that
<PB N="217" REF="226">
created new Love in</HI> Zephirus; I have no power
over another Fairy: but you, <HI>Zephirus,</HI> are a God,
and your Power can reach that cruel Rival.&endq; &startq;I
will endeavour, <HI>an&s;wer'd</HI> Zephirus, to overcome
the Love you have in&s;pired me with, to do you
an agreeable &s;ervice.&endq; After the&s;e Words he flew
away, leaving <HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome</HI> full of plea&s;ing
Expectations.</P>
<P><HI>Zephirus,</HI> fully convinced of the young Fairy's
Con&s;tancy, and having no hopes left, flew to the
horrible Pri&s;on where <HI>Alidorus</HI> was kept, attended
by &s;ix impetuous We&s;tern Winds, which open'd the
Pri&s;on-Doors, and afterwards carried the lovely
Shepherd in a bright Cloud to the Ca&s;tle of Flow|ers;
where, after he had &s;urvey'd him, his A&s;to|ni&s;hment
was not &s;o great at the Fidelity of <HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Alidorus</HI> and <HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome,</HI> overjoy'd to &s;ee
one another again, thought each other more amia|ble,
and loved more tenderly. Tho&s;e two Lovers
return'd the God a thou&s;and thanks, who after|wards
left them, and return'd to <HI>Flora.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Young-and-Hand&s;ome,</HI> willing that all her Court
&s;hould partake of her Happine&s;s, celebrated her
Marriage by a thou&s;and Sports throughout the Ex|tent
of her Empire, notwith&s;tanding the Grief of
the Princes her Lovers, who were Spectators of
the Triumph of the lovely Shepherd. And that &s;he
might be under no Apprehen&s;ions for the future of
<HI>Mordicant</HI>'s Rage again&s;t <HI>Alidorus,</HI> learnt him the
Fairy Art, and pre&s;ented him with the Gift of per|petual
Youth. After having be&s;tow'd &s;o great a
Ble&s;&s;ing on her happy Lover, mindful of his Glory,
&s;he gave him the Ca&s;tle of Flowers, and made him
to be acknowledged Sovereign of that Country,
where his Ance&s;tors had formerly reign'd; &s;o that

ju&s;t entring into the Gulph of <HI>Venice,</HI> when the
Weather changing &s;uddenly, put them in &s;ome fear

Waves &s;ome time, they found them&s;elves drove a|bove
an hundred Leagues from the Gulph, and up|on
the Weather's changing, and the Sea's growing
calm again, were attacked by two Brigantines,
commanded by <HI>Zoromy,</HI> a famous Cor&s;air, who came
upon them &s;o &s;oon after the Tempe&s;t, that they had

their Grief, which is much more ea&s;y to compre|hend;
the Ship was &s;oon crouded with <HI>Turks,</HI> who
not only robb'd them of their Effects, but al&s;o of
their Liberty: however, as they might judge, by
the Re&s;pect that was &s;hew'd tho&s;e Ladies, and the
Magnificence of their Clothes, that they were of
con&s;iderable Quality, they treated them with more
Civility than they could expect from <HI>Barbarians.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Zoromy</HI> took the two Lovers and their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es

not afflict them&s;elves, for that he would &s;weeten

and Don <HI>James</HI> had Slaves Habirs of the &s;ame
Stuff, but their good Mien &s;et them off more than
<HI>Zoromy</HI>'s Jewels. Thus dre&s;s'd, they were all four car|ried
to a Country-Seat of the Grand Vi&s;ier's, nigh
<HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> which he u&s;ed to retire to with a &s;mall
Court to divert him&s;elf. <HI>Achmet</HI> receiv'd <HI>Zoromy</HI> after
an obliging manner, admired the good Mien of his
Slaves, and told him he had never beheld any thing
&s;o beautiful as <HI>Leonora.</HI> As he &s;poke very good <HI>Spa|ni&s;h,</HI>
looking on <HI>Leonora</HI> with an Air of Tenderne&s;s
and Compa&s;&s;ion, he &s;aid to her, &startq;Throw off, Ma|dam,
tho&s;e Chains, Heaven has made you to give
to all that &s;ee you.&endq; To which Gallantry, <HI>Leonora</HI>
return'd no An&s;wer, but louring, fell a crying.
&startq;What are you grieved to be among us? <HI>continued
the V$&s;ier;</HI> I can a&s;&s;ure you, you had not more
Power in your own Country than here.&endq; &startq;I
ought always, Sir, <HI>replied &s;he,</HI> whatever Bounty
you &s;o generou&s;ly promi&s;e me, to di&s;tru&s;t my For|tune
for the future, &s;ince what has befel me;
therefore I beg of you not to think me ungrate|ful,
if I &s;hew not all the Sen&s;ibility I owe to
your Favour: But, Sir, <HI>added &s;he, throwing her&s;elf
at his feet,</HI> if you would dry up my Tears, be
<PB N="221" REF="230">
plea&s;ed to &s;et a Price on our Liberty, that we may
&s;ee our Friends and Relations again.&endq; To which
he an&s;wer'd, &startq;Since that fair Dam&s;el is thy Si&s;ter,
and the&s;e Slaves thy Brothers, I will grant you
what you ask for them; but for your&s;elf, I mu&s;t
take &s;ome time to think of it.&endq; By this An&s;wer
they knew that <HI>Achmet</HI> gave them their liberty,
only to &s;eparate them from <HI>Leonora;</HI> and being re|&s;olved
not to leave her, they made the Vi&s;ier this
An&s;wer, with a great deal of Re&s;pect: &startq;We de|&s;erve
not, Sir, the Favour you are plea&s;ed to grant
us, if we make u&s;e of it before we have &s;hew'd
our&s;elves worthy of it; therefore we make bold
to beg of you to &s;uffer us to remain &s;ome time in
the number of your Slaves, to pay our Acknow|ledgments.&endq;
Which <HI>Achmet</HI> con&s;ented to, and af|ter
having told the Cor&s;air, that he &s;hould always
remember the Pre&s;ent he had made, he conducted
<HI>Leonora</HI> and <HI>Matilda</HI> into the Apartment of his Wo|men,
where he kept &s;ome of the fine&s;t in the
World; he being a Man given up entirely to his
Plea&s;ures, but not &s;o much as to neglect any ways
the Affairs of the Publick. He was both hand&s;ome,
generous, and gallant, &s;ince he had &s;een &s;everal
other Courts, be&s;ides that of <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e two <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ladies he lodged in an Apart|ment
of &s;urprizing Beauty and Magnificence, and
came con&s;tantly every day to &s;ee <HI>Leonora;</HI> be&s;ides
the con&s;iderable Pre&s;ents he &s;ent, which were &s;uffi|cient
to inform the beautiful Lady what terrible
Circum&s;tances &s;he was in, and that he would not
wait long for Favours he might command: there|fore
&s;he &s;ometimes told him, that whatever was
po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by force, always in the end had &s;ome fa|tal
Con&s;equence, and that an Heart that yielded
through Inclination, and not Violence, was by far
mo&s;t preferable. And whenever he pre&s;s'd her hard,
&s;he always conjured him to give her liberty to ask
her&s;elf, whether her E&s;teem for him proceeded
from Authority or Tenderne&s;s; in which Propo&s;i|tion
<PB N="222" REF="231">
he di&s;cover'd &s;o much Delicacy, that he pro|mi&s;ed
to do every thing that might plea&s;e her.</P>
<P>He u&s;ed <HI>Matilda</HI> with all the Civilities imagina|ble,
and to engage her in his Intere&s;ts, made her
very con&s;iderable Pre&s;ents; and for Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI>
and Don <HI>James,</HI> he treated them &s;o generou&s;ly,
that they &s;eem'd more like Friends than Slaves.
But alas! what a melancholy Living was this for
Don <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> never to &s;ee his Mi&s;tre&s;s, and to
know &s;he was in the power of an ab&s;olute Rival!
His Soul was in continual Alarms, fir&s;t, for the
Weakne&s;s of the Sex, and next, on account of the
Vi&s;ier's Power. Don <HI>James,</HI> who&s;e Unea&s;ine&s;s up|on
<HI>Matilda</HI>'s account was not &s;o great, comforted
him the be&s;t he could, and endeavour'd to mitigate
his Pains. <HI>Leonora</HI> prolong'd the time the Vi&s;ier
had pre&s;cribed for her to pledge her Faith, and re|ceive
his, as long as &s;he could; and tho &s;he had
great rea&s;on to commend her own Proceedings, yet
was &s;he no le&s;s afflicted than Don <HI>Ferdinand.</HI> In
&s;hort, the Vi&s;ier pre&s;s'd her at la&s;t to determine on
what &s;he intended to do, telling her, that he in|tended
to marry her, and make her happy, and
that he &s;hould expect her An&s;wer the fir&s;t time he
came; at which <HI>Leonora</HI> appear'd melancholy and
thoughtful. After he was gone, <HI>Matilda</HI> came in,
and &s;eeing the Tears trickling down her Cheeks,
ask'd what new Subject &s;he had for that Grief.
Whereupon &s;he told her all that had pa&s;s'd, and
&s;poke of Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> with a great deal of Ten|derne&s;s;
but perceiving the Vi&s;ier li&s;tening behind
a Clo&s;et-door that belong'd to another Room, but
open'd into that, and &s;eeming not to know he was
there, continued the Di&s;cour&s;e, and &s;aid, &startq;I am
&s;en&s;ible, that if Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> had not been faith|ful,
I &s;hould not have been able to have di&s;pen&s;ed
with the Oaths we made, but &s;hould have lo&s;t my
Life, to have pre&s;erved my Heart his; nay, no
Separation &s;hould have alter'd my Sentiments:
but the ungrateful Wretch has been fal&s;e; you
<PB N="223" REF="232">
know, Si&s;ter, how ba&s;ely he has u&s;ed me; I am
re&s;olved to forget him, for my own quiet &s;ake,
and never to &s;peak to him more.&endq;</P>
<P>The Vi&s;ier retired very much concerned, and
could not forbear asking <HI>Matilda</HI> &s;everal Que&s;tions,
who knew too well what An&s;wers to return; and
<HI>Leonora</HI> being inform'd by her of what pa&s;s'd be|tween
them, and knowing that &s;he ought to ma|nage
a Lover, in who&s;e power &s;he was, with a
great deal of Art, &s;he &s;ent for him into her Cham|ber,
who, when he came in, di&s;cover'd by her
Looks the Grief &s;he was oppre&s;s'd with. &startq;Com|plain
not, Sir, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> that my Heart was en|gaged
before I knew you, which I could not re|&s;olve
to own; but &s;ince you are inform'd of it,
you know al&s;o how fal&s;e he has proved to me,
and if you will allow me &s;ome time to calm my
Troubles, I can promi&s;e you all the Marks of the
Acknowledgment I owe to your Goodne&s;s.&endq; &startq;I
confe&s;s, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> my Love and Honour were both
offended, to find there was a Competitor with me
for your Heart; I was not &s;urprized at thy In|difference,
which I attributed to thy Youth: nay,
I flatter'd my&s;elf with the hopes, that I might be
the fir&s;t that might touch thy Heart with &s;ome
Tenderne&s;s; but alas! cruel Fair, I dare not now
hope for it.&endq; As he made an end of the&s;e words,
he ca&s;t his Eyes on <HI>Leonora,</HI> to &s;eek &s;ome Ea&s;e in
hers; and &s;he at that very time looking favourably
at him, plea&s;ed him as well as if &s;he had &s;aid the
mo&s;t obliging things in the World. Thus &s;he ma|naged
while &s;he meditated on her Flight; to bring
which about, &s;he neglected nothing to gain time,
and make u&s;e of the fir&s;t Opportunity that offer'd,
to which end, Fortune was not &s;low at this time.</P>
<P>The Grand Signior return'd to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI>
where the Vi&s;ier was obliged to attend, and as
<HI>Leonora</HI> was not then in a perfect State of Health,
he would not put her to the Fatigue of a Journey;
when going into her Chamber to take his leave,
<PB N="224" REF="233">
he &s;aid, &startq;My charming <HI>Leonora,</HI> I am going from
you for two or three days, and &s;eem as if I left
my better part behind me, &s;ince nothing but the
Remembrance of thy Promi&s;es could make me re|&s;olve
on it. Alas! what will become of me, if
you &s;hould not keep them, and I &s;hould lo&s;e
thee? O Heavens! if&mdash;&endq; And &s;topping there,
he &s;tood &s;ome time mu&s;ing, which put <HI>Leonora</HI> into
a terrible $right, le$t he &s;hould have di&s;cover'd her
De&s;ign; but re&s;uming the Di&s;cour&s;e again, he
cry'd out, &startq;No, I will not alarm my&s;elf with any
groundle&s;s Fears, <HI>Leonora</HI> has granted me her
Love.&endq; &startq;Yes, you po&s;&s;e&s;s it entire, <HI>interrupted</HI> Le|onora;
I &s;hould think my&s;elf unfit to live, if I
an&s;wer'd your Pa&s;&s;ion with Indifference: go whi|ther
you Duty calls you, and fear not but your
Return back will be acceptable to me.&endq; <HI>Achmet</HI>
was &s;o much affected with what &s;he &s;aid, that he
gave her a thou&s;and A&s;&s;urances of an everla&s;ting
Pa&s;&s;ion: and when he bid her adieu, it was in &s;o
touching a manner, that one would have thought
him in the mo&s;t inexpre&s;&s;ible Agonies.</P>
<P>Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and Don <HI>James</HI> having been in|form'd
of their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es De&s;igns, &s;econded them
with &s;o happy a Succe&s;s, as to find out the means
to hire a Ve&s;&s;el: <HI>Leonora</HI> having gain'd &s;ome Chri|&s;tian
Slaves entirely devoted to her, who upon a
Signal given, &s;et the Seraglio on fire in &s;everal
parts at once; the confu&s;ion and Di&s;order that
generally attend the&s;e &s;orts of Accidents, facili|tated
our Lovers Entry into the Womens Apart|ments,
and gave them an opportunity to carry off
<HI>Leonora, Matilda,</HI> and &s;ome tru&s;ty Slaves: and as
the Palace was &s;ituate by the Sea-&s;ide, Sloops wait|ed
for to carry them on board the Ve&s;&s;el; which,
as &s;oon as they came, weigh'd Anchor, and &s;ail'd
away with a favourable Wind for the Gulph of
<HI>Venice.</HI> Never was any Voyage more agreeable and
plea&s;ant, wherein the&s;e tender Lovers had the hap|pine&s;s
of being together, and entertaining each
<PB N="225" REF="234">
other with the Tran&s;ports of their Joy. <HI>Leonora</HI>
and <HI>Matilda</HI> intended, when they came there, to
go into a Convent, till Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and Don <HI>James</HI>
had got the Count <HI>de Fuentes</HI>'s and the Marqui&s;s of
<HI>Toledo</HI>'s Con&s;ent; but upon more &s;erious Reflections
they both thought, that if they &s;hould defer their
Marriage, their enraged Relations might prevent
it, and if it was con&s;ummated, it would be out of
their power, and that after &s;ome time their Anger
might be over; if not, the Jewels that the Vi&s;ier
had given <HI>Leonora</HI> would keep an Equipage &s;uitable
to their Birth: therefore they agreed upon it, and
this Re&s;olution render'd the two Lovers Joys inex|pre&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>But to return to the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Toledo;</HI> he no
&s;ooner knew of <HI>Leonora</HI>'s being gone, but he pre|pared
to follow after her; and the Count <HI>de Fuen|tes,</HI>
who was very much afflicted, went with him,
and neglected no means to overtake the&s;e run-away
Children, but, as it happen'd, took the wrong Rout.
Tho the Count <HI>de Fuentes</HI>'s Concern was extraordi|nary,
yet it became not &s;o extravagant as the Mar|qui&s;s's
Grief, who threaten'd to di&s;inherit his Son;
and was &s;o much di&s;order'd thereby, that his Phy|&s;icians
thought him in &s;o great danger, that Don
<HI>Ferdinand</HI>'s Friends endeavour'd, by the re&s;pectful
Letters he &s;ent, to appea&s;e him. At la&s;t, when he
perceived he &s;hould die, he forgave him, as like|wi&s;e
did the Count <HI>de Fuentes</HI> his Daughters, who
were not only married, but their Choice proved
beyond what any of their Family could have pro|po&s;ed
for them. When the Marqui&s;s was dead, and
when Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> had paid all the Honours due
to his Memory, he and Don <HI>James</HI> came to <HI>Cadiz</HI>
with their Brides, where they were complimented
by all that knew them; and among the re&s;t, their
generous Friend and Relation Don <HI>Franci&s;co,</HI> who&s;e
Services had appear'd throughout &s;o eminent, that
Don <HI>James,</HI> who was never ungrateful, ask'd him
how he &s;hould acquit him&s;elf of the Obligations
<PB N="226" REF="235">
he lay under. Don <HI>Franci&s;co</HI> told him he might ea|&s;ily
do that, by giving him his beautiful Si&s;ter,
who&s;e Charms he had &s;o long adored; acquainting
him withal, that &s;he had no Aver&s;ion to his Pa&s;|&s;ion,
and it lay entirely in his brea&s;t to make them
happy. Don <HI>James</HI> embraced him with all the
Marks of Friend&s;hip, and &s;aid to him in an obli|ging
manner; &startq;I only complain that you &s;hould
keep a Secret from me, in who&s;e power it was
to &s;erve you: My Si&s;ter &s;hall certainly be no o|ther's
but yours, and for her Fortune, I will make
it worth your Acceptance.&endq; Don <HI>Franci&s;co,</HI> who&s;e
Joy was beyond de&s;cription, &s;aid all the mo&s;t en|gaging
things he could think of, and then went
with Don <HI>James</HI> to the Convent where his Si&s;ter
was brought up; who not only di&s;cover'd in their
Conver&s;ation a great &s;hare of Wit, but could not
di&s;gui&s;e her Sentiments &s;o well, but that her Bro|ther
penetrated into them. In &s;hort, he took her
out of this Religious Hou&s;e, the Wedding was &s;o|lemnized
at his own with great Magnificence; and
thus the&s;e three Lovers and their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es became
happy.</P>

<HEAD>The Hi&s;tory of the New GEN|TLEMAN-CITIZEN.</HEAD>
<P>_A Young Man, who&s;e Father was a &s;ub&s;tan|tial
Trade&s;man in <HI>Paris,</HI> and had left him
a plentiful Fortune, having Vanity enough
to &s;et up for a Man of Fa&s;hion, becau&s;e
he was rich; and thinking that he might not have
Re&s;pect paid to his new-a&s;&s;umed Quality in a Place
where he had been known to have &s;erved behind a
Counter, bethought him&s;elf of going into the Coun|try,
and making him&s;elf di&s;tingui&s;hed, by &s;etting
up for a Man of Learning and Judgment; and to
that end bought a Clo&s;et of Books that were a
young Student's, who was lately dead, not doubt|ing
in the lea&s;t but he &s;hould be as good a Scholar,
&s;ince he had the &s;ame Books: and likewi&s;e, that he
might pa&s;s for a Man of Bravery, learnt to fence,
but in the main was a mere Braggadocio. After this,
he was in di&s;pute what Country to pitch upon;
when at la&s;t bending his Thoughts towards <HI>Norman|dy,</HI>
he fix'd there, and &s;et out for <HI>Rouen,</HI> where he
found many of his Father's Corre&s;pondents, who
&s;trove who &s;hould entertain him be&s;t, but all to no
purpo&s;e: he was a Man of Quality, and &s;o no
Company for Trade&s;men; and to per&s;uade the World
he was really one, told the mo&s;t ridiculous Stories
imaginable. After having enquired what E&s;tates
there were to be di&s;po&s;ed of thereabouts, and be|ing
told of one that lay by the Sea-&s;ide; the De|&s;cription
of it plea&s;ed him &s;o well, that he went
to &s;ee it, and bought it: but the Hou&s;e not being
<PB N="228" REF="237">
fine enough, he pulled it down, and built another,
in which, as he pretended to every thing, he acted
as chief Architect. The Situation of this E&s;tate
was very plea&s;ant, it being along the Sea-&s;ide,
where a large River di&s;embogued it&s;elf; over which
he built a great &s;trong Bridge, and on that his
Hou&s;e, or Ca&s;tle, as we &s;hall &s;ometimes call it, to
which you mu&s;t a&s;cend on either &s;ide &s;ixty Stone
Steps with Iron Rails; &s;o that if it either rain'd
hard, or the Sun &s;hone hot, you run the ri&s;que of
being drown'd or burnt: and to complain, was an
unpardonable Fault.</P>
<P>But that our Gentleman-Cit might not be known,
he re&s;olved to lay a&s;ide his Paternal Name, and call
him&s;elf Mon&s;ieur <HI>de la Dandinardiere;</HI> the length
of which Name he thought would conduce very
much towards the impo&s;ing on his Neighbours,
who were for the mo&s;t part Country Gentlemen
of moderate E&s;tates, and little acquainted with the
Court: and to make them yield the &s;ooner to this
Impo&s;ition, always had his Pockets full of Letters
from Per&s;ons of the fir&s;t Quality, of his own wri|ting;
but in what Stile, Heaven knows. However,
they were always full of what News was mo&s;t re|markable
in that Province, and among the re&s;t, the
King was always in pain for his Health. To &s;up|port
the Rank a&s;&s;umed, he kept a Pack of Dogs,
and a Valet call'd <HI>Alain,</HI> who an&s;wer'd to as many
Titles as his Ma&s;ter plea&s;ed to employ him in Of|fices,
either as Secretary, Ho&s;tler, Cook, Steward,
or Valet. One day, as this Valet was hunting in
&s;ome neighbouring Grounds, and had kill'd &s;ome
Game, a Gentleman of a pa&s;&s;ionate Temper meet|ing
with him in his, beat him heartily; and upon
<HI>Alain</HI>'s threatning that his Ma&s;ter would make him
an&s;wer it at the Se&s;&s;ions, told him, that &s;ince he
thought to frighten him, he would let him &s;ee that
he knew who Mon&s;ieur <HI>de la Dandinardiere</HI> was, and
de&s;ired him to carry him four or five Strokes on
the Face from him, and ask him if he had ever
mea&s;ured &s;uch with his Yard.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="238">
The Valet went home with &s;well'd Eyes, and a
bloody Face, without any Game, tho his Ma&s;ter de|pended
on having &s;ome, to treat the next day two
or three hone&s;t Curates of the adjacent Villages.
When <HI>Alain</HI> had told him his Misfortunes, and that
<HI>Villeville,</HI> which was the Gentleman's Name, was the
Per&s;on who put this Affront upon him; he flew in|to
a terrible Pa&s;&s;ion, for he was very cholerick,
and very much offended at any Di&s;re&s;pect &s;hewn to
him: &startq;I'll be revenged, <HI>&s;aid he, pulling his Hat over
his Eyes;</HI> was I not now bu&s;y, he &s;hould find the
difference between my being his Friend and Foe.
I have a River that runs under my Hou&s;e, and
the Sea ebbing and flowing before my Windows,
my Hou&s;e cover'd with Slates; and this &s;orry Fel|low's
is nought but Mud-Walls, and thatch'd with
Straw.&endq; While he was walking about in this
Heat, with his Hands behind him, in came the Ba|ron
<HI>de St. Thomas,</HI> who was a Gentleman beloved
all thereabouts for the good Offices he did his
Neighbours; &s;ince there were no Quarrels, but he
made them up, nor no Marriage, or any Affair of
con&s;equence concluded, before his Advice was ta|ken.
He was of a good Family, but had little or
no Fortune, which made him &s;ubmit to marry a
very homely Woman, who was re&s;olved to lay out
what &s;he could to make her&s;elf hand&s;ome, notwith|&s;tanding
their Circum&s;tances would not allow of it.
She had two beautiful Daughters, whom &s;he could
not endure, becau&s;e they were grown up too &s;oon,
and all People of Under&s;tanding paid a greater de|ference
to them; for which rea&s;on &s;he kept them
lock'd up in a Summer-hou&s;e at the end of the
Garden. In this Solitude they read as many Ro|mances
as they plea&s;ed, and knowing them&s;elves
hand&s;ome, and that Fortune was unkind to them,
they fancied them&s;elves to be unfortunate Prin|ce&s;&s;es,
who lived in expectation of &s;ome Knight's
coming to deliver them out of this inchanted Ca&s;tle.
The little Acquaintance they had with the World,
<PB N="230" REF="239">
together with the&s;e Chimeras, made them &s;o much
out of the way, tho they wanted no Sen&s;e; yet
their Education render'd them &s;ingular, which
their Mother was not in&s;en&s;ible of, but was very
ea&s;y on that &s;core: provided they put her to no
expence, and that all was laid out on her&s;elf, their
Imaginations might be as extravagant as they plea|&s;ed.
Mon&s;ieur <HI>de St. Thomas</HI> was not a little con|cerned
at the Extravagancies of his Daughters, and
if he had enjoy'd a more plentiful Fortune, would
have endeavour'd to make them &s;en&s;ible of them;
but &s;ince they could be no otherwi&s;e happy, than
in their Imagination, he was forced to let them
plea&s;e them&s;elves that way.</P>
<P>The Baron <HI>de St. Thomas</HI> was very much &s;urprized
at the Outrage he ob&s;erved Mon&s;ieur <HI>Dandinardiere</HI>

&startq;You mu&s;t moderate your Pa&s;&s;ion, <HI>&s;aid
the Baron,</HI> you know the cruel Fate of all Dueli&s;ts;
&s;hould your De&s;ign be known to any of your Ene|mies,
you would be obliged to quit the Kingdom
immediately.&endq; &startq;My Honour, <HI>an&s;wer'd</HI> Dandinar|diere,
has always been dearer to me than my Life;
&s;hould I bear the&s;e In&s;ults, I might leave my
Hou&s;e: The&s;e <HI>Norman</HI> Dogs treat me ill; not that
I call them Dogs, Sir, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> to affront you, but
only out of the Exce&s;s of my Pa&s;&s;ion to <HI>Villeville.</HI>&endq;
&startq;Sir, <HI>reply'd Mon&s;ieur</HI> de St. Thomas, I don't take
things &s;o literally; but to let you &s;ee how much
I am devoted to your Service, if you are re&s;olved
<PB N="231" REF="240">
to fight, I am ready to carry the Challenge.&endq; This
Propo&s;ition &s;urprized <HI>Dandinardiere;</HI> the Danger he
was in abated his Pa&s;&s;ion, and his Friend's Zeal at
this time &s;eem'd the mo&s;t in&s;upportable thing in
the World. After &s;ome mu&s;ing, he reply'd, &startq;Do
you think in your con&s;cience, that if I &s;hould
fight with this Clown, that the Court will not
take notice of it?&endq; &startq;You need but appoint the
Place, <HI>reply'd the Baron;</HI> I know <HI>Villeville</HI> will not
refu&s;e you.&endq; &startq;Is he then a Man of Bravery?&endq; <HI>an|&s;wer'd</HI>
Dandinardiere, <HI>&s;omewhat di&s;order'd.</HI> &startq;Yes, to
Ra&s;hne&s;s, <HI>reply'd the Baron;</HI> he has kill'd more Men
in his life-time, than &s;ome have Flies.&endq; &startq;I am glad at
my very Soul of that, <HI>&s;aid he, putting the be&s;t face he
could on the matter;</HI> I remember the &s;ixteenth Duel
I fought, I kill'd my Antagoni&s;t before he well
knew where he was.&endq; &startq;Oh! I never que&s;tion'd
your Abilities, <HI>added the Baron;</HI> but do you intend
me the Plea&s;ure of being &s;erviceable to you?&endq;
&startq;I am determined on it, but will do nothing ra&s;h|ly,
<HI>&s;aid</HI> Dandinardiere; I &s;hall have the honour
to &s;ee you again in two or three days time.&endq;
Then changing the Di&s;cour&s;e, they talked of what
News there was from <HI>Paris</HI> and the Army.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>de St. Thomas</HI> had much ado to forbear
laughing before our Cit's face, and therefore got
away as fa&s;t as he could, being naturally gay, and
of a quick and ready Apprehen&s;ion, and &s;eeing the
Perplexity <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> was in, and that he was
more vex'd at him&s;elf for boa&s;ting &s;o much, than
at <HI>Villeville</HI> for his Affront, was re&s;olved to carry on
the matter to make &s;port: and having a Valet, a
notable Fellow, who was a <HI>Ga&s;coniard,</HI> and no
ways wanting in all the natural Qualifications of
his Country, whom in&s;tructing in what he &s;hould
do, he &s;ent, two or three days afterwards, to <HI>Dan|dinardiere</HI>
in a Buff-Coat, a black crape Neckcloth,
a large-brimm'd Hat, a great leathern Belt, in
which hung the mo&s;t terrible Sword that had ever
been &s;een &s;ince the time of <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror.
<PB N="232" REF="241">
<HI>Dandinardiere</HI> was walking along by the Sea-&s;hore,
when all on a &s;udden he &s;aw this Bullyhuff &s;o nigh
him, that notwith&s;tanding his great de&s;ire to &s;hun
him, yet he could not well do it. &startq;Are not you,
&startq;<HI>&s;aid the other,</HI> Mon&s;ieur <HI>Dandinardiere?</HI>&endq; &startq;How!&endq;
&startq;<HI>reply'd he, trembling.</HI> How! <HI>continued the other,</HI> what
do you mean by that An&s;wer?&endq; &startq;I mean, <HI>&s;aid</HI>
Dandinardiere, that I don't know you, and am
not very fond of any new Acquaintance; there|fore
I an&s;wer in two words, that I am call'd per|haps
<HI>Dandinardiere,</HI> and perhaps not.&endq; &startq;Then your
How is explain'd, <HI>&s;aid our Bravo;</HI> for my part, I
mu&s;t tell you without Ceremony, that Mon&s;ieur
<HI>Villeville</HI> being inform'd of your Behaviour, de&s;ires
you to meet him, three days hence, in the next
Wood: I am to be his Second, therefore it is
proper you provide one.&endq;</P>
<P><HI>Dandinardiere</HI> was &s;o &s;urprized, that this Hector
had time to get away, and hide him&s;elf behind a
Bank the Sea had thrown up, before he could re|cover
out of his Fright; and <HI>Dandinardiere,</HI> who in
&s;uch a ca&s;e as this would rather have to do with
a Devil than a Man, per&s;uaded him&s;elf that it was
an Apparition, and that &s;ome evil Spirit had put
on this fanta&s;tical Form to di&s;turb his Repo&s;e: and
upon this Suppo&s;ition deceived him&s;elf in his Con|jectures,
that he might make the World believe it,
and come off with Honour. When he came home,
all pale and trembling, he found the Prior <HI>Rich$cour</HI>
and the Vi&s;count <HI>Berginville,</HI> who were come to pay
him a Vi&s;it, but &s;aw him not, becau&s;e they were
bu&s;y, looking at &s;ome old Heroes which <HI>Dandinar|diere</HI>
had adorn'd his Hall with; but their Names
and principal Actions were writ in &s;o &s;mall a Cha|racter,
that the Prior and Vi&s;count were di&s;puting
thereupon, one &s;aying it was <HI>Gillet,</HI> and the other
<HI>Gillot:</HI> Whereupon our Gentleman-Cit &s;tepping up,
&s;aid it was <HI>Gille de Dandinardiere,</HI> his Grandfather,
who was bred up by <HI>Lewis</HI> the Eleventh, King of
<HI>France,</HI> in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Amboi&s;e,</HI> with <HI>Charles</HI> the
<PB N="233" REF="242">
Eighth, his Son. &startq;Now, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> this little Prince
was a fine Child, and endow'd with great Sen&s;e,
and loved my Grandfather <HI>Gille</HI> to di&s;traction; and
<HI>Lewis</HI> fearing, as the Hi&s;tory &s;ays, that his Son
might, &s;ome time or other, dethrone him, to &s;e|cure
him&s;elf, brought him up very indifferently,
and fed him with gro&s;s Meats: but <HI>Gille,</HI> his Fa|vourite,
had always Dainties, which he never
fail'd to let his Ma&s;ter partake of; in&s;omuch that
to recompence him, he made him I know not
what, but I believe it was Con&s;table.&endq; &startq;I am
&s;ure there never was any of that Name,&endq; <HI>&s;aid</HI>
&startq;<HI>the Prior.</HI> That's no matter, <HI>reply'd</HI> Dandinardiere,
at lea&s;t if he was not Con&s;table, he was Admiral
of the Hor&s;e; for 'tis certain, the Truncheon he
holds in his hand &s;ignifies no &s;mall Po&s;t.&endq; Thus
he explain'd to them all that he had cau&s;ed to be
writ of his Ance&s;tors, which he had all by heart,
and had continued therein a long time, notwith|&s;tanding
the Apparition he had &s;een, if the Vi&s;|count,
ca&s;ting his Eyes on him, and &s;eeing him as
pale as death, had not &s;aid, &startq;Alas! Sir, you are
going to die, you are &s;trangely changed!&endq; &startq;Nay,
after what has happen'd, 'tis a mercy I am alive,
<HI>&s;aid he;</HI> for if I had not had good Courage, I &s;hould
have died away immediately: Think with your|&s;elves,
Gentlemen, what Condition a Man mu&s;t
be in, to &s;ee a Devil in a human Shape, with
Eyes full of infernal Malice and cloven Feet.&endq;
Then he told them all that happen'd by the Sea|&s;hore;
but as &s;erious as the Prior and Vi&s;count af|fected
to be, they could not help laughing at this
chimerical Fright of his, but wink'd, and &s;ignified
their Thoughts to each other by their Smiles:
then, after &s;ome Exclamations upon &s;uch an extra|ordinary
Adventure, they advi&s;ed him to let blood,
which he con&s;ented to with a great deal of plea|&s;ure,
becau&s;e let things go as they would, he &s;hould
gain thereby &s;ome re&s;pite.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="243">
A Surgeon was immediately &s;ent for, but before
he could come, Dinner was ready, and <HI>Dandinardiere</HI>
would eat nothing, tho he was very hungry, and
the fre&s;h Breezes from off the Sea had got him a
good Stomach, had not his Friends told him he
mu&s;t, to get Strength to re&s;i&s;t both Men and De|vils;
which Advice he not only approved, but fol|low'd,
and eat more than both his Gue&s;ts. But as
the Surgeon lived a great way off, the Prior and
Vi&s;count were gone before he came, each admiring
at his Folly of boa&s;ting he was de&s;cended from a
Favourite of <HI>Charles</HI> the Eighth, and his pretending
he was frighten'd by a Devil; both agreeing that
there was &s;omewhat very plea&s;ant in what he had
told them, and thereupon re&s;olved to go to the
Baron <HI>St. Thomas</HI> to unriddle the matter. When
they came there, they found him in his u&s;ual Gay|ety
of Temper, tho he had no great rea&s;on for it;
&s;ince his Wife and Daughters, as I have &s;aid be|fore,
intermix'd &s;ome Gall with his Sweets. He
told his Friends the trick he had put upon <HI>Dandi|nardiere,</HI>
and &s;hew'd them the Man that had put
him into &s;uch a terrible fright, de&s;iring them to
keep the Secret, and he would go and offer his
Service again&s;t <HI>Villeville,</HI> and give them an exact
account of <HI>Dandinardiere</HI>'s Behaviour, when the Duel
&s;hould be propo&s;ed; with which they were both
&s;o very well plea&s;ed, that they de&s;ired the Baron
it might be the next day.</P>
<P>When the Surgeon came, <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> was not
willing to lo&s;e one drop of his Blood, but paid him
liberally to &s;ay he had, and order'd his Servants to
&s;ay the &s;ame. The Baron went early the next
Morning, when the faithful <HI>Alain</HI> told him he could
not wake his Ma&s;ter, becau&s;e he was very &s;ick.
&startq;Oh! <HI>&s;aid the Baron,</HI> I have bu&s;ine&s;s of the utmo&s;t
importance; therefore, good Friend <HI>Alain,</HI> open
his Door, for I mu&s;t &s;peak with him.&endq; <HI>Alain</HI> could
not deny the Baron admittance any longer, who
found <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> in bed, in a black Wai&s;tcoat,
<PB N="235" REF="244">
and a red woollen Cap on his Head, with a Toilet
an&s;werable thereunto. &startq;How can you &s;leep, <HI>&s;aid
Mon&s;ieur</HI> de St. Thomas, while <HI>Villeville</HI> is waiting
for you at the Place appointed? He told me ye|&s;terday
he &s;ent you a Challenge, and that he is
re&s;olved to fight you, whatever comes on it; and
I cannot believe you will refu&s;e him that Sati&s;|faction.&endq;
At this <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> trembled &s;o much
with fear, that he could not di&s;gui&s;e it: &startq;I needs
mu&s;t own, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> that I came not here to cut
Throats; had I any &s;uch De&s;igns, I &s;hould have
&s;tay'd in <HI>Paris,</HI> which is a murdering Place,
where &s;ome People take a plea&s;ure in tormenting
others. I came into this Province to live peace|ably,
and I have enough to render my Life plea|&s;ant;
why then &s;hould you advi&s;e me to ri&s;que
what is &s;o dear to me?&endq; &startq;I advi&s;e you as a
Friend, <HI>reply'd the Baron,</HI> you ought to follow the
Steps of your glorious Ance&s;tors; would you lo&s;e
your Honour for two or three Thru&s;ts with a
Sword? If the word Duel &s;eems har&s;h in your
Ears, we will change it, and call it a Rencoun|ter:
I intend to &s;erve you, and will be your Se|cond,
tho I hazard much more than you; for I
have a Wife and two Daughters, but for a Friend
I will venture all.&endq;</P>
<P><HI>Dandinardiere</HI> &s;eeing him&s;elf thus clo&s;ely pre&s;s'd,
had recour&s;e to a Feint, which had but ill Succe&s;s.
He fell back on his Pillow, and cry'd out with all
his might, &startq;I &s;hall die, I &s;hall die, I bled &s;o much
in the Night, for my Bandage unbound, and I
lo&s;t two Pail-fulls of Blood, that I faint.&endq; Where|upon
clo&s;ing his Eyes, he &s;tretch'd him&s;elf out,
and re&s;olved not to open them till the Baron was
gone, who pulled him about, &s;haked him heartily,
and gave him two or three Fillips on the No&s;e; all
which he took with a great deal of patience: then
running to a Ba&s;on of Water that &s;tood by, he
threw &s;o much in his face, that <HI>Dandinardiere,</HI> fear|ing
a &s;econd Inundation, open'd his Eyes, and
<PB N="236" REF="245">
turn'd red again with Anger: &startq;I beg of you, Sir,
<HI>&s;aid he,</HI> if you &s;ee me faint, to let me die, rather
than u&s;e me thus.&endq; &startq;I &s;ee my Zeal is taken ill,
<HI>reply'd the Baron;</HI> but no matter for that, I am
your Friend, and ready to &s;erve you: if you
would but fight, I &s;hould be &s;atisfied.&endq; &startq;For
God's &s;ake, Sir, <HI>an&s;wer'd</HI> Dandinardiere, let me
alone, for you are more trouble&s;ome than <HI>Villeville.</HI>&endq;
&startq;Would you be a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, <HI>added the Baron,</HI> for
that is the Fate of tho&s;e who keep not the A&s;&s;ig|nations
they make.&endq; At this Menace he began to
be unea&s;y, and &s;aid, &startq;Let me think a little, and
then I will give you a po&s;itive An&s;wer.&endq; Where|upon
Mon&s;ieur <HI>de St. Thomas,</HI> thinking he &s;hould tire
him too much, if he &s;hould urge him any more,
took his leave, and went home, tho <HI>Dandinardiere</HI>
pre&s;s'd him hard to &s;tay at Dinner.</P>
<P>When he was alone, he thought very &s;eriou&s;ly of
the Engagements he in honour laid under, and at
the &s;ame time believ'd he had found out a way to
pre&s;erve his Reputation, and to &s;leep in a whole
Skin, and that was to make <HI>Alain,</HI> arm'd cap-a-pe$,
fight <HI>Villeville,</HI> and for him&s;elf to appear in the &s;ame
Arms to the Baron and others; &s;o that they would
not know but that it was him&s;elf that &s;hould
fight. Then calling his faithful <HI>Alain,</HI> he &s;aid, &startq;I
do not doubt of thy Affection, but there are &s;ome
things that do not ab&s;olutely depend on our&s;elves;
for example, no Man can be brave, who in the
bottom is a Coward, &s;ince all his Endeavours to
be &s;o are in vain: for my part, I was born with
a Princely Heart, full of Courage and Re&s;olution;
but my only fault is, I have too much. Now
thou knowe&s;t, <HI>Alain,</HI> that that pitiful Fellow, <HI>Vil|leville,</HI>
would fight me; if I &s;hould re&s;olve on it,
he is a dead Man at the fir&s;t Thru&s;t; but I have
Riches, and &s;hould be &s;orry to lo&s;e them, if he,
as he is ha&s;ty, &s;hould kill me before I have put
my&s;elf in a Po&s;ture to prevent him: therefore
the only Remedy that I can think of in this bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
<PB N="237" REF="246">
is for you to fight in my &s;tead, while I
pray for you.&endq;</P>
<P>This Propo&s;ition &s;eem'd very hard and unrea&s;o|nable
to <HI>Alain,</HI> who was of a very mild and peace|able
Temper; who, after he had mu&s;ed &s;ome time
to make a plau&s;ible Excu&s;e, &s;aid, &startq;Unle&s;s you
could give me your Face, Shape, and Air, how
do you think I &s;hall re&s;emble you, but Mon&s;ieur
<HI>Villeville</HI> will di&s;cover the Cheat?&endq; &startq;If I remove
this Difficulty, <HI>reply'd</HI> Dandinardiere, will you
promi&s;e me to fight?&endq; &startq;Yes, Sir, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Alain, <HI>think|ing
it impo&s;&s;ible;</HI> and if you don't, what &s;hall I do to
you?&endq; &startq;What you plea&s;e, <HI>an&s;wer'd</HI> Alain.&endq; &startq;Well then,
<HI>&s;aid</HI> Dandinardiere, we &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee whether you
have any Honour and Courage.&endq; The&s;e words
put <HI>Alain</HI> into &s;uch a Fit of Trembling, that he
could not hold a Joint &s;till; and it coming into his
head, that the &s;ame Devil that his Ma&s;ter &s;aw by
the Sea-&s;ide, had taught him &s;ome extraordinary
Secret, &startq;Be plea&s;ed, Sir, to hear me, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> let
us have nothing to do with the Devil, I be&s;eech
you; for I would not damn my&s;elf for any one:
I hate Sorcery and all its Ways, I renounce the
Bargain, if &s;o; and will not fight if I was &s;ure to
get an hundred Pieces by it.&endq; This Cowardice of
<HI>Alain</HI>'s, inrag'd <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> &s;o much, that he took
his Cane and laid it &s;martly over his Shoulders,
telling him that he might expect as much every
day, if he did not re&s;olve to obey him; which
U&s;age &s;o vex'd <HI>Alain,</HI> that he was in an hundred
minds to leave his Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P><HI>Dandinardiere,</HI> for his part, was full of Cares;
the appointed time drew nigh, and he had found
out no way to avoid it: however he re&s;olv'd to
put <HI>Alain</HI> into Armour, he having bought two old
Head-pieces and Gantlets, and all things fitting for
a Warrior; and &s;earching after him for that end,
found him &s;et in a little dark Cellar, by a Runlet
of Wine, the Bal&s;am of which Liquor, he thought,
might $word$ $$e &s;marting of his Shoulders. &startq;Come
<PB N="238" REF="247">
up, you &s;neaking Dog, <HI>cry'd</HI> Dandinardiere <HI>on the
Top of the Stairs,</HI> come and &s;ee whether I am a
Sorcerer, or thou art a Fool.&endq; Upon which
<HI>Alain</HI> made ha&s;te to drink off his Can of Liquor,
and came up more brisk than he went, the Wine
having put a little Courage in him; and follow'd
his Ma&s;ter into his Chamber, but was terribly
frighten'd at the &s;ight of the Armour, but much
more when <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> bid him put it on. &startq;What
mu&s;t I put on fir&s;t, Sir, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> for 'tis Logick to
me.&endq; &startq;I'll &s;hew you, you great Booby, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Dan|dinardiere,
for if I am not your Valet-de-Cham|bre,
you won't have Courage enough to equip
your&s;elf.&endq; Whereupon he put on the Cuira&s;s,
which was &s;o &s;trait, that poor <HI>Alain</HI> was forc'd
to &s;trip off his Wai&s;tcoat and Doublet, and ex|po&s;e
his Sides to hard Iron. &startq;This is the Habit
of the greate&s;t Kings when they go to War,
<HI>&s;aid</HI> Dandinardiere.&endq; &startq;Ah, <HI>reply'd</HI> Alain, tho&s;e Kings
were certainly great Fools to wear &s;uch a &s;coun|drel
Habit, when they might have what Velvet
and Sattin they pleas'd; for my part, I am &s;ure, I
like a good Feather-bed much better.&endq; &startq;O Ra&s;cal!
<HI>cry'd</HI> Dandinardiere, you will never come to be
a great Man; for &s;uch Wretches as thou, are
ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h'd from People of Quality, by
their Inclinations: now I, who am a Man of
fa&s;hion, I would eat, drink, and &s;leep in Armour.&endq;
&startq;Yes, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Alain; but yet you won't meet Mon&s;ieur
<HI>Villeville,</HI> which, thank you, you re&s;erve for me
to do.&endq; This un&s;ea&s;onable Reproach of <HI>Alain</HI>'s,
made his Ma&s;ter &s;o angry, that without returning
any An&s;wer, he clap'd on the Head-piece with &s;o
much Force, and &s;o little Skill, that he had like
to have kill'd him: for being as unexpert at it as
his Man, he put the hind part before; which
made poor <HI>Alain,</HI> who could hardly fetch his
Breath, &s;tamp and tear like a Man mad: while
<HI>Dandinardiere,</HI> who fancied it proceeded from his
Ill-will, and being not u&s;ed to &s;uch Apparel, almo&s;t
<PB N="239" REF="248">
&s;plit his Sides with laughing; but at la&s;t perceiv|ing
his Mi&s;take, took it off pre&s;ently, and found
<HI>Alain</HI> chang'd as black as his Hat. After giving
him &s;ome time to recover, he put it on again, and
armed him&s;elf likewi&s;e, and drawing his Man to
a great Gla&s;s that &s;tood in his Room, &s;aid to him,
&startq;Now in thy own opinion who do&s;t thou take
thy&s;elf to be?&endq; &startq;Why <HI>Alain,</HI> Sir, who &s;hould I
be?&endq; &startq;Go, you Blockhead, <HI>reply'd his Ma&s;ter,</HI> you are
Mon&s;ieur <HI>de la Dandinardiere;</HI> for when the Vi&s;ors
of our Head-pieces are down, there's no diffe|rence;
and I am &s;ure <HI>Villeville</HI> can never di&s;tin|gui&s;h
us. Have a good heart, hone&s;t Lad, I don't
intend you &s;hall fight for nothing; I promi&s;e
you a Reward alive or dead: If you are kill'd,
you &s;hall be buried as great as any Lord of the
Land; and if you come off &s;afe, I'll marry you
to <HI>Kate,</HI> for whom I am &s;ure you have a great
Re&s;pect. Hold, there's Half-a-crown and &s;ome
Farthings by way of advance: You know your
Fortune will be made.&endq; Whereupon, <HI>Alain</HI> be|ing
flu&s;h'd with Wine, and &s;eeing the Money,
and relying on his Ma&s;ter's Promi&s;e to gain him
his Mi&s;tre&s;s, cry'd out, &startq;I'll fight, &s;ince Riches and
my <HI>Kitty</HI> are the Prize:&endq; which words plea&s;ed
<HI>Dandinardiere</HI> &s;o well, that he embrac'd him for
Joy.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Prior and the Vi&s;count
waited full of Expectation at the Baron's; and
when he came, were very much diverted with
<HI>Dandinardiere</HI>'s Fears, and re&s;olved it &s;hould co&s;t
him &s;omething to make peace. Not long after,
<HI>Dandinardiere,</HI> who depended on <HI>Alain,</HI> arriv'd arm'd
Cap-a-pee, with a large Plume of Feathers on his
Head-piece, a long Sword; and, to look the more
terrible, had cut off the Tail of a fine Hor&s;e, and
fa&s;ten'd it to his Shoulders for a Shoulder-knot.
In this &s;trange Equipage, he might very well be
taken for Don <HI>Quixot</HI> the &s;econd, tho not half &s;o
valiant, follow'd by his worthy Imitator of <HI>Sancho
<PB N="240" REF="249">
Pancho.</HI> Neverthele&s;s he could not help being
afraid of meeting with <HI>Villeville,</HI> notwith&s;tanding
he had great Confidence in his Vi&s;or. &startq;It is impo&s;|&s;ible,
<HI>&s;aid he to</HI> Alain, for my Enemy to know
me, if he &s;hould meet me; for I can tell him he
is mi&s;taken, and that I am not <HI>Dandinardiere:</HI> and
after &s;uch a Declaration, it would be very imper|tinent
in him to ask any more Que&s;tions.&endq; The
Man approved of his Prudence: but as they were
thus talking, he began to fear le&s;t <HI>Alain</HI> &s;hould find
out that their Arms were not alike; and &s;hould
alledge, that <HI>Villeville</HI> might ea&s;ily di&s;cover who he
was. Thereupon, &s;topping all on a &s;udden, he
bid <HI>Alain</HI> go home, and not be unea&s;y if he did
not come that Night, for he might probably be at
the Baron's; and withal, charg'd him to exerci&s;e
him&s;elf in his Arms, becau&s;e it might be of &s;ervice
to him. This Order &s;urpriz'd <HI>Alain</HI> again, who
now began to cool upon it, and fall off from that
Gaiety of Temper he acquir'd in the Cellar; and
an&s;wer'd with a Shrug of his Shoulders, &startq;That he
did not care to fight; that he knew not what
belong'd to it.&endq; Happy was it for him, that his
Ma&s;ter heard him not, for if he had, his Shoul|ders
mu&s;t have paid for it.</P>
<P><HI>Dandinardiere</HI> follow'd the Road by the Sea-&s;ide,
till he came to a little Garden-hou&s;e, at the end
of a Garden; from whence he heard &s;omebody
&s;ay, Make ha&s;te Si&s;ter <HI>Marthonida,</HI> and come and
&s;ee a Knight in Arms; and not doubting but he
was the Per&s;on that was &s;o call'd, lifted up h$$
Eyes, plea&s;ed to think he had excited &s;o much
Curio&s;ity: but how great was his Surprize to &s;ee
two beautiful Young Ladies at a grated Window,
who were the Baron <HI>de St. Thomas</HI>'s Daughters,
whom <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> had never &s;een, tho he had
been a vi&s;iting there &s;everal times. He made them &s;o
low a Bow, that had not the Vi&s;or &s;tood his No&s;e's
Friend, he had certainly broke it again&s;t the Pum|mel
of the Saddle; which Salute they return'd with
<PB N="241" REF="250">
U&s;ury; and as both Parties were Strangers to each,
their Admiration was reciprocal.</P>
<P>As <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> was capable enough of any Im|pre&s;&s;ion
of Tenderne&s;s, he was &s;o gallant as to be
over-joy'd at &s;o unexpected and agreeable a &s;ight;
and for the Ladies, their Heads were full of &s;uch
a number of great Actions and Adventures of Knights
Errants, Heroes, and Princes, that they were no|thing
nigh &s;o much &s;urprized to &s;ee <HI>Dandinardiere</HI>
in that comical Dre&s;s, as he was at two &s;uch beau|tiful
Per&s;ons living retired from all the World in
a little Box by the Sea-&s;ide. <HI>Virginia,</HI> who was the
elde&s;t of the two Si&s;ters, and who call'd her&s;elf
<HI>Virginia</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>Maria,</HI> which was her true Name,
(as likewi&s;e did her Si&s;ter <HI>Martha</HI> a&s;&s;ume that of
<HI>Marthonida</HI>) was the fir&s;t who broke &s;ilence. &startq;Tho,
my Lord, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> you may have Affairs of the
greate&s;t Importance that may call you away, yet
give us leave to ask you how you came to go by
our Windows.&endq; Whereupon, <HI>Dandinardiere,</HI> who
was mightily pleas'd with the Title of Lord, that
he might not be behind-hand in point of Civility,
reply'd, &startq;Since, divine Highne&s;&s;es, you vouch&s;afe to
ea&s;t your eyes on &s;o unfortunate a Wretch, know
that an Affair of Honour obliged me to it.&endq; &startq;What,
noble Knight, <HI>interrupted</HI> Marthonida, are you go|ing
then to fight? Who can be that hardy Man
that dare meet you?&endq; <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> was &s;o much
tran&s;ported with the&s;e fine things, that he thought
he had never di&s;cover'd in all his Life &s;o much
Wit in any Per&s;on before; and thereupon reply'd
&startq;I cannot, Ladies, tell you who the Gentleman is,
having &s;ome Rea&s;ons to the contrary; but I can
a&s;&s;ure you, as &s;oon as I have cut off his Head, I
will come and hang it at your Window as an Ho|mage
due to your Beauty.&endq; &startq;Oh, my Lord, <HI>cry'd</HI>
Virginia, if you do &s;o, we &s;hall die away with
fear.&endq; To which he reply'd, That rather than
di&s;plea&s;e them he would die him&s;elf; that his
Sentiments were &s;o nice and delicate, that never
<PB N="242" REF="251">
any Pa&s;&s;ion made &s;o great a progre&s;s in &s;o &s;hort
a time, and that he was in the utmo&s;t de&s;pair
that his Affairs &s;hould oblige him to leave them;
but having a mind before he took his leave, to
&s;hew him&s;elf and Hor&s;e, and &s;purring and checking
him at the &s;ame time, the poor Hor&s;e not knowing
what he would be at, reared up an end, and
<HI>Dandinardiere</HI> &s;eeing him&s;elf in danger, out of fear
gave the Hor&s;e another Jerk with the Bridle, and
pull'd him upon him&s;elf; the &s;ight of which made
the two confined Prince&s;&s;es &s;hriek out: for lying
under his Hor&s;e upon &s;harp Flint-&s;tones, he &s;adly
brui&s;ed his &s;ide, and his Head-piece, as he fell, un|fortunately
flying off, he cut his Head cruelly.
<HI>Marthonida</HI> &s;eeing him bleed, lo&s;t all patience, and
bid her Si&s;ter &s;tay at the Window while &s;he went
and acquainted the Family with the Di&s;a&s;ter that
had befallen this Knight.</P>
<P>Away &s;he ran to her Father's Study, where the
Vi&s;count and Prior were drinking of Coffee with
him. &startq;Make ha&s;te, Sir, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> and come away
to the Sea-&s;ide: a Knight arm'd Cap-a-pee is dan|gerou&s;ly
wounded, and &s;tands in need of your
A&s;&s;i&s;tance.&endq; &startq;What, <HI>&s;aid the Baron &s;miling, who
was u&s;ed to the&s;e Sallies of his Daughters,</HI> is he a
Knight of the Round-Table, or one of the twelve
Peers of <HI>France?</HI>&endq; &startq;I can't tell, <HI>&s;aid &s;he, with a
&s;erious and melancholy Countenance,</HI> who he is; but
his Hor&s;e is grey, with his Mane and Tail tied up
with Ribbons, and his Right-ear is cut off.&endq; The
Baron and Vi&s;count knowing by this De&s;cription
that it was <HI>Dandinardiere,</HI> and looking at one ano|ther,
amaz'd at what <HI>Marthonida</HI> had told them,
without &s;taying to ask any more Que&s;tions, made
all the ha&s;te they could to get to the Place &s;he
directed them to, where they found our unfortu|nate
Cit in a real Swoon; but were very much
&s;urpriz'd at his Equipage and Metamorpho&s;is. After
they had rubb'd his Temples with Hungary-Water,
and u&s;ed the mo&s;t proper means they could think
<PB N="243" REF="252">
of, they brought him to him&s;elf again, and led
him to the Baron's Hou&s;e frighten'd almo&s;t out of
his Wits. <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Marthonida,</HI> who were all
the time at their Window, were at a great lo&s;s to
know how their Father came to be acquainted
with this valiant Knight, and to inform them&s;elves
went into their Mother's Chamber, whither the
Baron was gone to tell her of the Adventure of
their Neighbour <HI>Dandinardiere.</HI> Whereupon, being
very &s;paring by way of Ho&s;pitality, tho profu&s;e
enough in what related to her&s;elf, &s;he ask'd, if he
de&s;ign'd to &s;tay long, and thought to be cured at
their expence. To which he made an&s;wer, that
&s;he had no need to trouble her&s;elf about that, he
was very rich, and would make them amends.
Then taking her a&s;ide into his Clo&s;et, &startq;The Vi&s;count
<HI>Berginville, &s;aid he,</HI> has ju&s;t now communicated
to me a Thought of his, which I very much approve
of; and that, is to per&s;uade <HI>Dandinardiere&punc;</HI> to marry
one of our Daughters, which I &s;hould be very
glad of, &s;ince you know I have not much to give
them.&endq; &startq;But, <HI>reply'd</HI> Madam <HI>de St. Thomas,</HI> (who was
full of her Whims) you know our Family, and
&s;hall we marry them below their Rank, and di&s;|grace
our&s;elves by &s;o unequal a Match?&endq; &startq;Believe
me, Madam, <HI>&s;aid the Baron,</HI> Quality without a
Fortune an&s;werable, is but grinning Honour; I
wi&s;h with all my heart, that this Citizen, as much
beneath them as you imagine, was &s;o mad: but
don't you now go and &s;et your Daughters again&s;t
it, for I know you are likely enough to undo
what I have taken &s;o much pains about.&endq; &startq;What,
<HI>cry'd &s;he, changing Colour,</HI> am not I as much their
Mother as you their Father? Ought not I to
have been con&s;ulted, and my Advice taken as well
as yours? No, Sir, my Daughters &s;hall marry
none but a Marqui&s;s or an Earl.&endq; &startq;Right, Madam,
<HI>&s;aid Mon&s;ieur</HI> de St. Thomas <HI>coldly,</HI> keep up the
Dignity of your Birth, and your Daughters fifty
Years longer.&endq; Upon this the Barone&s;s was &s;o
<PB N="244" REF="253">
enraged, that &s;he rung &s;uch a Peal in his Ears as
brought the Vi&s;count and Prior into the Clo&s;it.
&startq;I appeal to the&s;e Gentlemen, <HI>&s;aid the Baron.</HI>&endq; &startq;And
for my part, I refu&s;e them to be the Judges, <HI>an&s;wer'd
the Barone&s;s;</HI> &s;ince I look upon them to be more
your Friends than mine, and as Advi&s;ers to this
fine Marriage.&endq; But the&s;e Gentlemen having Sen&s;e
enough to enter into this Di&s;pute without aggra|vating
her, de&s;ired her to moderate her Pa&s;&s;ion in
an Affair &s;o ea&s;y to be regulated, &s;ince &s;he gave her
Con&s;ent, provided her Son-in-law was a Man of a
good Family; telling her, that they could a&s;&s;ure
her his Hall was full of the Pictures of his Grand|fathers,
and that they had ob&s;erved among the
re&s;t one call'd <HI>Gille de la Dandinardiere,</HI> who was at
lea&s;t Con&s;table in the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> VIII. At
the&s;e Words the Barone&s;s began to be a little
calm; and gave her word, that if it was &s;o, &s;he
would not be again&s;t it. Thereupon they advis'd
her to go and &s;ee him, and offer him her A&s;&s;i&s;tance;
which &s;he could not con&s;ent to, till &s;he had been
and adju&s;ted her Dre&s;s, and &s;pent &s;ome Hours at
her Toilet. Afterwards &s;he went into <HI>Dandinar|diere</HI>'s
Chamber, who had been ju&s;t dre&s;&s;ed by a
Surgeon of the Village, who was a great Blockhead,
and &s;aid always he was afraid of curing but by
halves; and to perfect his Cure was very ready at
cutting off Legs and Arms, and upon occa&s;ion the
Head too: and having a mind to exerci&s;e his In|ci&s;ion-knife
on our wounded Knight, he no &s;ooner
perceiv'd it in his Hand, but he cry'd out with
all his might, &startq;Mon&s;ieur <HI>de St. Thomas,</HI> I put my|&s;elf
under your Protection, let me not endure
any more.&endq; Upon which Words the Baron put a
&s;top to Mr. <HI>Robert</HI>'s further Proceeding.</P>
<P>When Madam <HI>de St. Thomas</HI> came, &s;he found
him more vex'd than &s;ick, and his Wound not to
be &s;o great as &s;he expected from &s;o terrible a Fall.
She offer'd civilly to take care of him till he was
well, to keep him company, and al&s;o to bring her
<PB N="245" REF="254">
Daughters to divert him. &startq;I can &s;ay, <HI>added &s;he,</HI>
without Vanity, that they have both Wit and a
nice Ta&s;te They are be&s;ides great Readers, and
make as good a u&s;e of it, for they can &s;ay <HI>Amadis</HI>
of <HI>Gaul</HI> by heart.&endq; &startq;I believe, Madam, <HI>an&s;wer'd</HI>
Dandinardiere, all you &s;ay is true: but having
had the good-fortune to meet with two young
Prince&s;&s;es of an incomparable Beauty, my Thoughts
are &s;o full of them, that I &s;hould be very glad of
their Company to blot them out of my remem|brance:
not that what I &s;ay proceeds from any
want of Re&s;pect to the Ladies your Daughters,
but rather from my Fears of finding them too
charming.&endq; At this the Barone&s;s blu&s;h'd again
with Anger, and bridling to &s;hew her Re&s;entment,
&s;aid, &startq;You are at your own liberty, Sir; I thought
to have done you a plea&s;ure, but there is no
nece&s;&s;ity for my Daughters coming.&endq; Then ri&s;ing
up, &s;he took her leave, but in &s;o ill an Humour
that &s;he could almo&s;t have hang'd her Husband and
the Vi&s;count, reproaching them with their u&s;ele$s
Endeavours. &startq;I fore&s;ee, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> and I am &s;eldom
mi&s;taken, that I &s;hall have no rea&s;on to be plea|&s;ed
with this Vi&s;it: this Man is in love with two
or three Prince&s;&s;es, and cannot think of <HI>Virginia.</HI>&endq;
Mon&s;ieur <HI>de St. Thomas</HI> was too great a lover of
Peace to make any An&s;wer that might provoke her
any more, but went with the Vi&s;count and Prior
to take a Walk in the Garden; where talking of
<HI>Dandinardiere</HI>'s Extravagances, he &s;aid, he could
not imagine who he meant, and where he had
&s;een tho&s;e charming Prince&s;&s;es he &s;poke of, and
that he verily believ'd his Head was turn'd. &startq;Then
the blame lies at your door, <HI>an&s;wer'd the Vi&s;count;</HI>
for &s;ince the Challenge the <HI>Ga&s;coniard</HI> carry'd
from <HI>Villeville,</HI> he has not been &s;en&s;ible, and his
being thus in Armour is a convincing Proof of
it.&endq;</P>
<P>The next day the&s;e three Gentlemen went to
pay him a Vi&s;it in his Chamber; when after &s;ome
<PB N="246" REF="255">
&s;mall talk, he &s;eem'd de&s;irous to have a little private
di&s;cour&s;e with the Baron; whereupon the other
two retired. When they were alone, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> ta|king
the Baron's Hand between his, &startq;May I de|pend
on you as a true Friend?&endq; &startq;That you may
undoubtedly, <HI>an&s;wer'd the Baron,</HI> &s;ince I profe&s;s
my&s;elf &s;o.&endq; &startq;You mu&s;t know then, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Dandi|nardiere,
that I de&s;ign'd to meet <HI>Villeville</HI> in Arms,
as you &s;aw me; I never fight otherwi&s;e: and if
he does not like that, he may let me alone, for
I won't abate a Gantlet. I came to you, to de|&s;ire
you to tell him to provide the like Arms,
thinking he might not have any by him, being
unwilling to take any advantage of him, having
the Rules of Honour and Chivalry writ in my
Face: but not to weary you with too long a di&s;|cour&s;e,
I will open my Mind to you in three
Words, and tell you I am in love.&endq; &startq;How long
have you been in Love, <HI>&s;aid the Baron?</HI>&endq; &startq;Four
and twenty Hours and &s;ome Minutes, <HI>reply'd he,</HI>
if I reckon right: Nay, I have not always been
in&s;en&s;ible to the Charms of Beauty. I have been
in love before, and have perform'd &s;ome Gal|lantries
that &s;urpriz'd all <HI>Paris,</HI> and fill'd up a
Paper call'd the <HI>Mer$ury Galante.</HI> I &s;hort, &s;ome
Dutche&s;&s;es that &s;hall be namele&s;s, having dealt
unhand&s;omely by me, and been fal&s;e to me, I
mu&s;t own to you, I laid it &s;o much to heart,
and was &s;o much enraged again&s;t my cruel Stars,
I came to throw my&s;elf into the Sea; but finding
the Situation plea&s;ant, I thought it better to
build me an Hou&s;e, and live here in a lethargick
Philo&s;ophy. Thus, Sir, I lived free from Love,
Law-&s;uits, and Ambition, and enjoy'd my&s;elf; when
my fir&s;t Misfortune began by <HI>Villeville</HI>'s Violence,
and <HI>Alain</HI>'s impertinently bragging. That Ra&s;cal
has brought an Affair of Honour upon my hands,
which oppre&s;&s;es me like a huge Mountain; for
I have no de&s;ire to lo&s;e my E&s;tate, and be bani&s;h'd
<HI>France.</HI> However, I have re&s;olved on this unhap|py
<PB N="247" REF="256">
Duel, on condition, as I have &s;aid, that I fight
in Armour: of which I was coming to inform
you; when, as I was riding along by the Shore,
I heard two young Per&s;ons talking loud, who
charm'd me with the Sweetne&s;s of their Voices;
when looking about, I &s;aw in a little Box with
Iron-barr'd Windows, two Prince&s;&s;es or Demi-Prince&s;&s;es,
which made me over-joy'd; particularly
the Fair-one has &s;tole my Heart. Their Conver|&s;ation
was &s;o polite and pretty, and they talk'd
with &s;o great an Energy, and&mdash;that I never
&s;hould have done, if I &s;hould expre&s;s the Agree|ablene&s;s
thereof; and when they call'd me my
Lord, which &s;hew'd that they were, or had
been breed up in Courts, methoughts they
rais'd up my Heart as a Kite does a Pidgeon. In
the mid&s;t of the Re&s;pect and Admiration they
created in my Heart, I knew not what I did;
and in&s;tead of giving my&s;elf an Air on hor&s;e|back,
I unfortunately fell, and brui&s;ed my Head
again&s;t the Stones; &s;o that I am at pre&s;ent in
love, &s;ick, ingaged in a Quarrel with <HI>Villeville,</HI>
and the mo&s;t unfortunate of all Men.&endq; Here
<HI>Dandinardiere</HI> was &s;ilent &s;ome time, to fetch two or
three Sighs like a Man oppre&s;s'd with Sorrows;
while the Baron who heard him without any in|terruption,
lifted up his Hands and Eyes towards
Heaven, to &s;hew his Surprize at what he had re|lated;
and being not &s;paring of his Sighs, &s;igh'd in
his turn. &startq;Fear not, dear Friend, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> we mu&s;t
hope all from Time.&endq; &startq;Alas, Sir, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Dandinar|diere,
I am in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion: but what
I am now mo&s;t concern'd at, is, for my Love and
Health; therefore I de&s;ire you would &s;end for
a more able Surgeon than Mr. <HI>Robert,</HI> and write
a Letter for me to tho&s;e beautiful Per&s;ons I told
you of.&endq; &startq;If you will dictate, <HI>&s;aid Mon&s;ieur</HI> de St.
Thomas, I &s;hall be very ready to be your Secre|tary.&endq;
&startq;I would not give you that trouble, <HI>reply'd</HI>
Dandinardiere, if my Head was better; but it is &s;o

after mine, for no Device was approved but what
was done after my manner.&endq; &startq;I make no di&s;pute

whether my Wife may have any plain green Silk.&endq;
&startq;It's no matter whether it is plain or not, <HI>&s;aid</HI>
Dandinardiere, if it be but green Silk.&endq;</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>de St. Thomas</HI> went out, and &s;ent the
<HI>Ga&s;coin,</HI> for he dur&s;t not let him come in le&s;t
<HI>Dandinardiere</HI> &s;hould know him; who after he had
&s;ought over twenty Drawers, bethought him&s;elf of
going to the young Ladies, and told them the Gen|tleman
that was wounded, de&s;ired the favour of
them to &s;end a piece of green Silk and &s;ome Wax
to &s;eal up a Letter. As they never could make
any Excu&s;e to go into his Chamber, they were
overjoy'd at this that pre&s;ented it&s;elf; thereupon
telling the <HI>Ga&s;coin</HI> that they had none, while he
went and ask'd all the Family, they &s;lipt up the
Garden Walls that their Mother might not &s;ee
them; and with a little work'd Box, in which
they kept gilt Paper, Ink, Sand, and pieces of
Silk of all Colours, came into <HI>Dandinardiere</HI>'s Cham|ber,
and had got to his Bed-&s;ide before their Fa|ther,
<PB N="250" REF="259">
who&s;e Back was turn'd towards them, &s;aw
them: when the &s;ick Man, knowing them at fir&s;t
&s;ight, and getting up an end in Bed, cry'd out,
&startq;Make room for the Prince&s;&s;es.&endq; Upon which the
Baron thought him mad; but turning about, &s;aw his
two Daughters. &startq;The&s;e are <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Martho|nida,
&s;$id he,</HI> who are come to make you a Vi&s;it,
knowing that I was here.&endq; &startq;No, Sir, <HI>reply'd the
eld$ &s;t,</HI> one coming from you to tell us that this
young Stranger wanted a piece of green Silk, we
have brought it with us.&endq; <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> was &s;o
confounded at &s;o great a Favour, and agitated with
&s;o many different Thoughts, that he was not able
to return any An&s;wer; for thinking that it was a
Prince&s;s he was in love with, and finding that he had
de&s;cended &s;ome Steps lower, he thought that the
Letter, which he had writ in that Character, would
not be agreeable to a Country Lady, and had a
mortal Regret to lo&s;e all tho&s;e Commendations &s;he
was &s;o de&s;erving of: having plea&s;ed him&s;elf with
carrying on a gallant Intrigue, and having a Man
of Quality for his Confidant, not &s;u&s;pecting he was
the Father of his Mi&s;tre&s;s. But as he now di&s;co|ver'd
the My&s;tery, he laid a&s;ide his De&s;pair, being
over-joy'd to find tho&s;e charming Strangers again;
be&s;ides, their Readine&s;s to come into his Chamber
flatter'd his Vanity and Heart &s;o much, that he was
not able to open his Lips. When the Baron, who
never mi&s;tru&s;ted when he writ the Letter, that it
was to his Daughters, &s;oon ea&s;ed him of his trou|ble,
telling him with an Air of Gayety, that he
would not call <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Marthonida</HI>'s Merit in
que&s;tion, &s;ince they were capable of making an
Impre&s;&s;ion on him; and de&s;ired they might not be
debarr'd the Plea&s;ure of reading the mo&s;t gallant
Billet-deux that had been writ for &s;ome Ages,
a&s;&s;uring him, that they wanted not a Ta&s;te of the
Beauries it contain'd. The Ladies for their parts
had no occa&s;ion for any Preparation to engage them
to fall into an Exta&s;y; they were delighted &s;o much
<PB N="251" REF="260">
with the <HI>Optick Gla&s;s,</HI> that they cry'd out, How
beautiful and delicate is this Thought! how few
are there that can write in this manner? <HI>Dandi|nardiere</HI>
was all the time adju&s;ting his Night-cap,
a&s;hamed to have his Head bound up; and catching
up his Cask which was in a Chair that &s;tood by the
Bed-&s;ide, was for putting it on, as he &s;aid, to ap|pear
more decent before the Ladies. The Baron at
this new piece of Extravagance could not help
laughing to him&s;elf, and let him try at an Impo&s;&s;ibi|lity,
for his Head was at that time half as big again
as his Cask; when finding he could not get it on,
he &s;aid, &startq;Ladies, I hope you will accept of my re|&s;pectful
Intentions, but&mdash;&endq; &startq;Oh Sir, <HI>interrupted</HI>
Virginia, we take the Will for the Deed; but
le&s;t we &s;hould incommode you, I think we ought
to retire.&endq; &startq;Ah glorious Suns! <HI>cry'd out the Cit,</HI>
would you darken my Chamber by your Eclip&s;e?&endq;
&startq;Sir, <HI>&s;aid he, turning towards the Baron,</HI> oblige the&s;e
charming Godde&s;&s;es to &s;tay, I be&s;eech you.&endq; &startq;No,
<HI>an&s;wer'd the Baron,</HI> I am vex'd that you have talk|ed
&s;o much as you have done; take a little Repo&s;e,

care of. Farewel, we will leave you; depend
upon it, Mr. <HI>Robert</HI> &s;hall come no more; you &s;hall

<P>Thus the Father and two Daughters took their
leaves of <HI>Dandinardiere,</HI> who de&s;ir'd he might not
be deny'd &s;ome Books, that he might divert the
Melancholy their Ab&s;ence might create, by read|ing.

my Ver&s;es.&endq; &startq;Ha! What's that you &s;ay, Sir, <HI>cry'd</HI>
Marthonida, are you a Poet; if &s;o, let us have

&startq;Oh, this is not a proper time, <HI>&s;aid the
Baron, pu&s;hing them out;</HI> with your good-wills you

<P>Being thus obliged to retire, as &s;oon as they got
back to their Apartment, they &s;ent their Knight-Errant
the Story by their Maid, who &s;eem'd over|joy'd
at the&s;e Marks of their E&s;teem; but as he
was not in a condition to read any long time, he
&s;ent to tell the Prior that he wanted earne&s;tly to
&s;peak with him, which put the whole Family in
no &s;mall Alarm, every one being curious to know
the cau&s;e. When the Prior came, he ask'd him
what he would have: <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> &s;hew'd him the
Story, and de&s;ired him to a&s;&s;uage his Pain by
reading it to him; which he began as follows.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>The Story of the White Cat.</HEAD>
<P>THERE was a King who had three Sons, all
hand&s;ome brave young Gentlemen; but jea|lous
that they &s;hould de&s;ire to reign before his Death,
he cau&s;ed &s;everal Reports to be &s;pread abroad, that
they endeavoured to procure them&s;elves, Creatures
to deprive him of his Crown. The King found
him&s;elf $ery old, but his Sen&s;e and Capacity of
Government no ways decay'd; &s;o that he cared
not to re&s;ign up a Place he fill'd &s;o worthily, and
thought that the be&s;t way for him to live at quiet
was to amu&s;e them by Promi&s;es. To this end he
took them into his Clo&s;et, where after he had
talk'd to them with great Candour, he &s;aid,
<PB N="253" REF="262">
&startq;You will agree with me, my Children, that my
great Age will not allow me to apply my&s;elf to
the Affairs of the Publick with as much Care as
formerly; and I am afraid my Subjects will not
be &s;o well plea&s;ed with my Admini&s;tration: there|fore
I intend to re&s;ign my Crown to one of you.
But as it is very ju&s;t that you &s;hould &s;trive to
plea&s;e me for &s;uch a Pre&s;ent, and as I de&s;ign to
retire into the Country; I &s;hould be very glad to
have a very pretty little Dog to keep me compa|ny:
therefore without having more regard to my
elde&s;t than my younge&s;t, I declare to you, that
which of you brings me the mo&s;t beautiful Dog
&s;hall be my Heir.&endq;</P>
<P>The three Princes were very much &s;urprized at
their Father's De&s;ire for a little Dog: for the two
younger, they were extraordinary well plea&s;ed at
this Propo&s;al; and for the elder, he was either
too timorous or re&s;pectful to repre&s;ent his Rights.
However they took their leaves of the King, who
gave them Money and Jewels, telling them that
they mu&s;t all return without fail in a Year's time,
on a certain day, with their Dogs. But before
they &s;et out on this Search, they all went to a
Ca&s;tle three Leagues off, where they made an En|tertainment,
and invited their mo&s;t tru&s;ty Friends
and Confidants, before whom the three Brothers
&s;wore an eternal Friend&s;hip to one another, pro|mi&s;ing
never to be jealous of each other's good|fortune;
but that the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful &s;hould let
the other two partake with him, appointing that
Ca&s;tle for the Place of their Rendevouz, and from
thence to go all together to the King.</P>
<P>They every one took a different Road without
any Attendants; and for the two elde&s;t they had
a great many Adventures: but as the Particulars
are not &s;o well known by me, I &s;hall pa&s;s them
over in &s;ilence, and &s;peak only of the younge&s;t,
who was a Prince of a &s;weet Behaviour, exact
Shape, fine Features, had delicate Teeth, perfor|med
<PB N="254" REF="263">
all Exerci&s;es fit for a Prince with a good
grace; and to &s;um up all in one, was a Youth of
bright parts, and brave even to a fault: be&s;ides, he
&s;ang very agreeably, and play'd on the Lute and
Theorbo to admiration, and painted with great
Judgment. Not a day pa&s;s'd over his head, but
he bought Dogs of &s;ome kind or other, as Hounds,
Greyhounds, Spaniels, <HI>&amp;$.</HI> that were pretty, keeping
always the mo&s;t beautiful, and letting the others
go; for it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to keep all the
Dogs he purchas'd, &s;ince he had neither Gentle|man,
Page, or any other Per&s;on along with him:
however he kept going on, without fixing on any
certain place; when he was &s;urpriz'd one Night in
a large Fore&s;t where he could find no Shelter, by
a Storm of Thunder, Lightning, and Rain. Still
he pur&s;u'd the Road, and went a long way, when
&s;eeing a &s;mall Light, he per&s;uaded him&s;elf &s;ome
Hou&s;e was nigh where he might get a Lodging
that Night; following the Light, he arriv'd at the
Gates of a &s;tately Ca&s;tle, which were all of ma&s;&s;y
Gold; in which were Carbuncles which gave that ex|traordinary
Light which the Prince &s;aw &s;o far off.
The Walls were of fine China, whereon the Hi|&s;tories
of all the Fairies &s;ince the Creation of the
World were repre&s;ented; but the Rain and ill
Weather would not &s;uffer our Prince to &s;tay to
examine them all, tho he was charm'd to find the
Adventures of Prince <HI>Lutin,</HI> who was his Uncle,
among the re&s;t.</P>
<P>He return'd to the Door, after having rambled
&s;ome Paces off, and there found a Deer's Foot at
the end of a Chain of Diamonds, which made him
admire the Magnificence: he pulled, and &s;oon
heard a Bell, which by the Sound he judged to
be either Gold or Silver; and &s;ome time after the
Door open'd, and he &s;aw no Per&s;on, but only
twelve Hands, each holding a Flambeau, at which
&s;ight he was very much &s;urpriz'd, and was in di&s;|pute
whether or no he &s;hould proceed any further,
<PB N="255" REF="264">
when to his great Amazement he felt &s;ome others
behind him which pu&s;h'd him forwards; where|upon
he advanced with his Hand on his Sword,
tho very unea&s;y, and as he thought in &s;ome danger:
when going into a Wardrobe of Prophiry and Lapis
Lazuli, he heard two &s;weet Voices &s;ing the&s;e words;
<Q><L>With Unconcern behold the&s;e Hands,</L>
<L>And dread no fal&s;e Alarms,</L>
<L>If you are &s;ure you can with&s;tand</L>
<L>The Force of Beauty's Charms.</L></Q></P>
<P>He could not believe he was invited &s;o kindly
to &s;uffer any Injury; which made him, finding
him&s;elf forced forwards, to go to a great Gate of
Coral, which open'd as &s;oon as he approach'd it, and
he went into a Hall of Mother of Pearl, and thence
into &s;everal Chambers adorn'd and inrich'd with
Paintings and Jewels; a va&s;t number of Lights that
were let down from the Ceiling of the Hall, contri|buted
to light &s;ome part of the other Apartments,
which be&s;ides were hung round with Gla&s;s Scon|ces.
In &s;hort, the Magnificence was almo&s;t incre|dible.
After having gone into &s;ixty Chambers&punc; the
Hands that conducted him &s;pot him, and he &s;aw a
great Ea&s;y Chair make up towards him; the Fire|light
of it&s;elf, and the Hands, which were both
white and finely proportion'd, undre&s;s'd him, he
being wet and in &s;ome danger of catching cold.
A fine Shirt, and a Night-gown of Gold Brocade,
with Cyphers and &s;mall Emeralds, were given
him, and a Table and Toilet brought by the&s;e
Hands. Every thing was very grand: the Hands
comb'd out his Hair with a lightne&s;s that gave
him plea&s;ure, and afterwards dre&s;s'd him in extra|ordinary
fine Clothes, while he not only &s;ilently
admired at them, but at la&s;t began to be in &s;ome
little fright. When he was dre&s;s'd, that he &s;eem|ed
as beautiful as <HI>Adonis,</HI> they conducted him into
a &s;tately Hall richly furni&s;h'd, where he &s;aw in
<PB N="256" REF="265">
fine Painting, the Stories of the mo&s;t famous Cats;
as <HI>Rodillardus</HI> hung by the Heels in a Council of
Rats, the Cat in Boots, the Marqui&s;s <HI>de Carabas,</HI>
the writing Cat, the Cat turn'd Woman, Witches
in the Shapes of Cats, with their nightly Meetings,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> all very odd and &s;ingular.</P>
<P>Two Cloths were laid, both garni&s;h'd with gold
Plate, with Beaufets$ &s;et out with va&s;t number of
Gla&s;&s;es, and Cups made of valuable Stones; and
while the Prince was thinking with him&s;elf what
they were laid for, he &s;aw &s;ome Cats come and
place them&s;elves upon a Bench &s;et there for that
purpo&s;e, one holding a Mu&s;ick-Book, another with
a Roll of Paper to beat time with, and the re&s;t
with &s;mall Guittars: when all on a &s;udden they
every one &s;et up a mewing in different Tones, and
&s;truck the Strings with their Talons, which made
the &s;trange&s;t Mu&s;ick that ever was heard. The
Prince would have thought him&s;elf in Hell, if the
Palace had not been &s;o wonderful fine, it put him
&s;o much in mind of it; then &s;topping his Ears, he
laughed heartily at the &s;everal Po&s;tures and Grima|ces
of the&s;e &s;trange Mu&s;icians. And while he was
calling to mind the &s;everal things that had hap|pen'd
&s;ince his being in this Ca&s;tle, he &s;aw a little
Figure about half a yard high come forward in a
Veil of black Crape, led by two Cats in mourning
Clokes, with Swords by their &s;ides, and follow'd
by a numerous Train of Cats; &s;ome carrying Rats,
and &s;ome Mice in Traps and Cages.</P>
<P>The Prince was in the greate&s;t Amazement, and
knew not what to think; when the little Figure in
black coming up to him, and lifting up its Veil, he
&s;aw the prettie&s;t little White Cat he ever had &s;et his
Eyes on, which &s;eem'd to be young, but with$$l
very melancholy, and &s;et up &s;uch an agreeable and
charming Mewing, as went to the Prince's heart.
&startq;Prince, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> you are welcome, it is a plea&s;ure
to me to &s;ee you here.&endq; &startq;Madam Pu&s;s, <HI>reply'd the
Prince,</HI> you are very generous to receive me &s;o
<PB N="257" REF="266">
graciou&s;ly; but you appear to me to be a Cat of
extraodinary Merit: for the Gift you enjoy of
Speech, and this &s;tately Ca&s;tle you po&s;&s;e&s;s, are
convincing Proofs of it.&endq; &startq;Prince, <HI>an&s;wer'd the White
Cat,</HI> I de&s;ire you would forbear your Compli|ments,
for I am both plain in my Di&s;cour&s;e and
Manners, but have a good heart. Let us go, <HI>&s;aid
&s;he,</HI> to Supper, and bid the Mu&s;icians leave off,
for the Prince does not under&s;tand what they &s;ay.&endq;
&startq;What, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> do they then &s;ay any thing?&endq; &startq;Yes,
<HI>an&s;wer'd the White Cat,</HI> we have Poets, and
great Wits; and if you will &s;tay with us, you
&s;hall be convinced of it.&endq; &startq;I need but hear you
&s;peak to believe that, <HI>an&s;wer'd he gallantly,</HI> for I
look on you as on &s;omething more than common.&endq;</P>
<P>Supper was brought up, the Hands &s;et on the Ta|ble
two Di&s;hes of Soup, one made of young Pid|geons,
and the other of fat Mice. The &s;ight of
the one hinder'd the Prince from eating of the
other, fancying that the &s;ame Cook had dre&s;&s;ed
both; which the White Cat gue&s;&s;ing at, a&s;&s;ured
him that &s;he had two Kitchens, and that he might
eat of whatever was &s;et before him, and be con|fident
there were no Rats or Mice in any thing of|fer'd
him. The Prince, who believed that this
beautiful Cat would not deceive him, wanted not
to be told &s;o twice. He ob&s;erved a little Picture
to hang upon her foot, at which he was not a lit|tle
&s;urprized, and asked her to &s;hew it him, think|ing
it might be &s;ome fine Pu&s;s, a Lover of the
White Cat; but was in amaze to &s;ee an hand&s;ome
young Man, who re&s;embled him very much. The
White Cat &s;igh'd, and growing melancholy, kept a
profound &s;ilence. The Prince perceiv'd that there
was &s;omething extraordinary, in it, but dur&s;t not
inform him&s;elf, for fear of di&s;plea&s;ing or grieving
his kind Entertainer. He diverted her with all
the News he knew, and found her very well ac|quainted
with the different Intere&s;t of Princes, and
other things that pa&s;s'd in the World. When Sup|per
<PB N="258" REF="267">
was done, the White Cat carried her Gue&s;t in|to
a Hall, where there was a Stage, on which
twelve Cats, and as many Apes, danced a Mask in
<HI>Moor$&s;h</HI> and <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Habits; and when this was over,
the White Cat bid her Gue&s;t good-night, and the
Hands led him into an Apartment oppo&s;ite to that
he had &s;een, but no le&s;s magnificent: it was hung
with Tape&s;try, made of the Wings of Butterflies,
the Variety of which Colours form'd mo&s;t beauti|ful
Flowers. The Bed was of fine Gawze, tied
with Bunches of Ribbon, and the Gla&s;&s;es reach'd
from the Ceiling down to the Floor, and the Pan|nels
between repre&s;ented, in carved Work, thou|&s;ands
of <HI>Cupids.</HI></P>
<P>The Prince went to bed, and &s;lept a little, but
was awaken'd again by a confu&s;ed Noi&s;e. The
Hands took him out of bed, and put him on an
hunting Habit. He look'd out of the Window,
and &s;aw above five hundred Cats, &s;ome leading
Greyhounds, and others blowing Horns; it being
that day a great Fea&s;t, whereon the White Cat had
a mind to go a hunting, and was willing that the
Prince &s;hould partake of that Diver&s;ion. The
Hands pre&s;ented to him a wooden Hor&s;e, that had
a good &s;peed and ea&s;y paces, which he made &s;ome
&s;cruple to mount, alledging, that certainly they
took him for a Don <HI>Quixote;</HI> but his Refu&s;al &s;ignified
nothing, they &s;et him on the wooden Hor&s;e, which
was finely capari&s;on'd, with a Saddle and Hou&s;ing
of Gold, be&s;et with Diamonds. The White Cat
rid on a mo&s;t beautiful Ape, having thrown off her
Veil, and put on a Hat and Feather, which gave &s;o
bold an Air, as frighten'd all the Mice that &s;aw
her. Never was there better Sport; the Cats out|ran
the Hares and Rabbits, and whenever they took
one, the White Cat always paunch'd its Prey, and
gave them their Fees. For the Birds, they were
not in much greater Security; the Cats climb'd up
the Trees, and the Ape carried the White Cat up
to the Eagles Ne&s;ts. When the Cha&s;e was over,
<PB N="259" REF="268">
&s;he took a Horn, of about a finger's length, which,
when &s;ounded, was &s;o loud, that it might be heard
&s;ome Leagues; and as &s;oon as &s;he blow'd, &s;he had
pre&s;ently all the Cats in the Country about her,
&s;ome mounted in Chariots in the Air, and &s;ome in
Boats, but all in different Habits, which made a
fine Show. With this pompous Train &s;he and the
Prince return'd to her Ca&s;tle, who thought it fa|vour'd
very much of Sorcery; but was more &s;ur|prized
at the Cat's &s;peaking, than all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he came home, &s;he put on her black
Veil again, and &s;upped with the Prince, whom the
fre&s;h Air had got a good Stomach; the Hands
brought him fine Liquors, which he not only drank
of with plea&s;ure, but made him forget the little
Dog he was to procure for his Father: His Thoughts
were bent on bearing the White Cat company, and
he &s;pent his time in Hunting and Fi&s;hing, and &s;ome|times
in Balls and Plays. The White Cat made &s;uch
pa&s;&s;ionate Songs and Ver&s;es, that he began to think
&s;he had a tender Heart, &s;ince &s;he could not expre&s;s
her&s;elf as &s;he did, and be in&s;en&s;ible of the Power
of Love; but her Secretary, who was an old Cat,
writ &s;o bad an hand, that &s;hould any of her Works
remain, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to read them. The
Prince had forgot his Country, the Hand &s;till wait|ed
on him, and he regretted his not being a Cat,
that he might pa&s;s his Life in &s;uch plea&s;ant Com|pany.
&startq;Alas! <HI>&s;aid he to the White Cat,</HI> how &s;orry
am I to leave you, &s;ince I love you dearly: ei|ther
become a Woman, or change me into a
Cat.&endq; Which Wi&s;h the White Cat only an&s;wer'd
in ob&s;cure Words, tho &s;he was mightily plea&s;ed
with it.</P>
<P>Thus a Year &s;lipt away free from Care and Pain.
The White Cat knew the time he was to return,
and as he did not think of it, put him in mind
thereof. &startq;Don't you know, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> that you have
but three days to find a little Dog in, and that
your Brothers have got &s;ome very fine ones?&endq;
<PB N="260" REF="269">
This rouzed the Prince out of his Lethargy: &startq;By
what &s;ecret Charm, <HI>cry'd he,</HI> have I forgot the
only thing in the World, that is of the greate&s;t
importance to me? What will become of my Ho|nour
and Fortune? Where &s;hall I find a little
Dog beautiful enough to gain a Kingdom, and a
Hor&s;e &s;wift enough to make diligent &s;earch after
one?&endq; Then beginning to afflict him&s;elf, and
grow unea&s;y, the White C$$ &s;aid to him, &startq;Do not
grieve, Prince, I am your Friend; you may &s;tay
here a day longer yet, for tho it is five hundred
Leagues off, the good wood$n Hor&s;e will carry you
there in le&s;s than twelve Hours.&endq; &startq;I thank you,
beautiful Cat, <HI>&s;aid he;</HI> but 'tis not enough for me
to return to my Father, I mu&s;t carry with me a
little Dog.&endq; &startq;Here take this Acorn, <HI>&s;aid the White
Cat,</HI> it has a beautiful little Dog in it; put it to
your Far, and you will hear it bark.&endq; The Prince
obey'd, heard it bark, and was tran&s;ported with
Joy: He would have open'd it, &s;o great was his
Curio&s;ity; but the White Cat told him it might
catch cold, and he had better &s;tay till he gave it
to his Father. He thank'd her a thou&s;and times,
and bid her a tender Farewel, a&s;&s;uring her, that he
never pa&s;s'd his Days &s;o plea&s;antly as with her,
and that he was grieved to leave her behind him;
adding, that tho &s;he was a Sovereign, and had
great court paid to her, yet he could not forbear
asking her to go along with him: to which Propo|&s;ition
&s;he only an&s;wer'd with a Sigh.</P>
<P>The Prince came fir&s;t to the Ca&s;tle, that was ap|pointed
for the Rendevouz with his Brothers, who
arrived &s;oon afterwards, but were very much &s;ur|prized
to &s;ee a wooden Hor&s;e in the Court, that
leapt better than any in all the Academies. The
Prince went to meet them, they embraced, and
gave each other an account of their Adventures;
but our Prince took care to conceal the truth of
his, and &s;hew'd them only an ugly Turn-&s;pit, tel|ling
them that he thought him very pretty: at
<PB N="261" REF="270">
which, tho they were very good Friends, the two
elde&s;t conceived a &s;ecret Joy. The next day they
all three went together in the &s;ame Coach to the
King. The two elde&s;t carried their Dogs in Ba&s;|kets
&s;o white and delicate, that none dur&s;t hardly
touch them; and the younge&s;t had his poor de&s;pi|cable
Turn-&s;pit in a String. When they came to
the Palace, the Courtiers crouded about them, to
welcome them home. The King, when they came
into his Apartment, knew not in who&s;e favour to
declare, for the two little Dogs that the elder Bro|thers
brought were almo&s;t of equal Beauty, when
the younge&s;t pulling the Acorn out of his Pocket,
which the White Cat gave him, put an end to the
Difference. As &s;oon as he open'd it, they all &s;aw a
little Dog laid on Cotton, and &s;o &s;mall, that he
might go thro a Ring and never touch it. The
Prince &s;et it on the ground, and pre&s;ently it began
to dance a Saraband with Ca&s;taners, as nimble and
as well as the be&s;t <HI>Spaniard.</HI> It was of a Mixture
of &s;everal Colours, its Ears and long Hairs reach'd
to the Ground. The King was very much &s;ur|prized,
and tho it was impo&s;&s;ible to meet with any
thing &s;o beautiful as <HI>Tonton,</HI> by which Name it was
call'd, yet he was not very ready to part with his
Crown, the lea&s;t Gem of which was dearer to him
than all the Dogs in the World. He told his Chil|dren,
that he was very well plea&s;ed with the pains
they had taken; but that they had &s;ucceeded &s;o
well in the fir&s;t thing he had de&s;ired, that he had
a mind to make further proof of their Abilities be|fore
he perform'd his Promi&s;e: and that w$s, he
would give them a Year to find out a Web of
Cloth fine enough to go thro the Eye of a &s;mall
working Needle. They all &s;tood &s;urprized and
concerned, that they were to go ag$in upon ano|ther
Search; however, the two eld$$$ &s;eem'd the
more ready, and all three parted witho$t making
&s;o great a Profe&s;&s;ion of Friend&s;hip as they did the
<PB N="262" REF="271">
fir&s;t time, for the Story of the Turn-&s;pit had &s;ome|what
abated it.</P>
<P>Our Prince mounted his wooden Hor&s;e again,
and without looking after any other A&s;&s;i&s;tance, than
what he might expect from the Friend&s;hip of the
White Cat, return'd in all diligence to the Ca&s;tle,
where he had been &s;o well receiv'd; where he not
only found all the Doors open, but the Windows,
Walls, and Walks illuminated. The Hands came
and met him, held his Hor&s;e's Bridle, and led him
into the Stable, while the Prince went to the White
Cat's Chamber, who was laid in a little Basket, on
a Quilt of white Sattin. When &s;he &s;aw the Prince,
&s;he made a thou&s;and Skips and Jumps, to expre&s;s
her Joy, and &s;aid, &startq;Whatever rea&s;on I might have,
Prince, to hope for your Return, I mu&s;t own I
dur&s;t not flatter my&s;elf with it; &s;ince I am gene|rally
unhappy in what I mo&s;t de&s;ire, therefore
this &s;urprizes me.&endq; The Prince, full of Acknow|ledgment,
care&s;s'd her often, and told her the Suc|ce&s;s
he had in his Journey, which &s;he was not
unacquainted with, and that the King required a
Web of Cloth &s;o fine, as it might be drawn thro
the Eye of a Needle, which he believed was a
thing impo&s;&s;ible; but that however he would not
fail to try to procure &s;uch a one, relying on her
Friend&s;hip and A&s;&s;i&s;tance. The White Cat, put|ting
on a grave Air, told him it was an Affair that
required &s;ome Con&s;ideration, that by Good-fortune
&s;he had in her Ca&s;tle &s;ome Cats that &s;pun very
fine, that &s;he would do what &s;he could to forward
that Work, &s;o that he might &s;tay there, and not
trouble him&s;elf to &s;earch el&s;ewhere, it being un|likely
for him to meet with any &s;o ea&s;ily.</P>
<P>Soon after the Hands appear'd, carrying Flam|beaux,
and the Prince follow'd the White Cat
into a magnificent Gallery, that look'd on to a Ri|ver,
upon which there were &s;ome artificial Fire-works,
made to burn four Cats, who had been ac|cu&s;ed
and convicted of eating &s;ome Roa&s;t-meat de|&s;ign'd
<PB N="263" REF="272">
for the White Cat's Supper, with &s;ome Chee&s;e
and Milk; and be&s;ides, for con&s;piring again&s;t her
Per&s;on with <HI>Martafax</HI> and <HI>Lermites,</HI> two famous
Rats in that Country: but as it was thought that
there was a great deal of inju&s;tice done them, and
that mo&s;t of the Witne&s;&s;es were &s;uborn'd, the
Prince obtain'd their Pardon; notwith&s;tanding, the
Fire-works were let off, which gave the Prince
very great diver&s;ion. Afterwards a Repa&s;t was
&s;erved up, which gave the Prince more plea&s;ure
than the Fire, for his Riding had got him an extra|ordinary
Stomach: for the re&s;t of the time, he &s;pent
it in agreeable Entertainments, with which the in|genious
White Cat diverted her Gue&s;t, who was
perhaps the fir&s;t Mortal that was &s;o well enter|tain'd
by Cats, without any other Company. In|deed
the White Cat had a ready Wit, and could
di&s;cour&s;e on any Subject, which often put the
Prince into a great Con&s;ternation, and made him
&s;ay to her, &startq;Certainly, all this that I ob&s;erve &s;o
wonderful in you, cannot be natural; therefore
tell me by what Prodigy you think and &s;peak &s;o
ju&s;tly?&endq; &startq;Forbear asking me any Que&s;tions,
Prince, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> for I am not allow'd to an&s;wer
them, but you may conjecture what you plea&s;e;
let it &s;uffice that I have u&s;ed you with Re&s;pect,
and that I intere&s;t my&s;elf tenderly in what re|gards
you.&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;econd Year roll'd away in&s;en&s;ibly, as well
as the fir&s;t; the Prince wi&s;h'd for nothing, but the
diligent Hands brought it to him, whether Books,
Jewels, fine Pictures, or antique Medals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> when
the White Cat, who was always watchful for the
Prince's Intere&s;t, inform'd him that the time of his
Departure drew nigh, but that he might be ea&s;y
concerning the Web of Cloth, for &s;he had a won|derful
fine one made; and added withal, that this
time &s;he would give him an Equipage &s;uitable to
his Birth, and without waiting for an An&s;wer, ob|liged
him to look into the great Court of the Ca|&s;tle,
<PB N="264" REF="273">
in which there waited an open Chariot of
embo&s;s'd Work in Gold, in &s;everal gallant Devices,
drawn by twelve milk-white Hor&s;es, four a-brea&s;t,
who&s;e Harne&s;&s;es were cover'd with Velvet of Fire-colour,
which was the &s;ame as the Lining of the
Chariot, be&s;et with Diamonds, and the Buckles of
Gold. An hundred Coaches with eight Hor&s;es, full
of the Lords of his Retinue, magnificently clothed,
follow'd this Chariot, which was guarded be&s;ides
by a thou&s;and Body-Guards, who&s;e Clothing was
&s;o full of Embroidery, that the Cloth was hardly
di&s;cover'd; and what was very &s;ingular, the White
Cat's Picture was &s;een every where, both in the
Devices on the Chariot, and on the Guards. &startq;Go,
Prince, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> and appear at the King your Fa|ther's
Court in &s;o &s;tately a manner, that your
Magnificence may &s;erve to impo&s;e on him, that
he may refu&s;e you no longer the Crown you de|&s;erve.
Take this Walnut, be &s;ure to crack it in
his pre&s;ence, and you will find in it &s;uch a Web
as you want.&endq; &startq;Lovely White Cat, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> I own
I am &s;o penetrated with your Bounty, that if
you will give your con&s;ent, I will prefer pa&s;&s;ing
my days with you, before all the Grandeur I
may promi&s;e my&s;elf el&s;ewhere.&endq; &startq;Prince, <HI>reply'd
&s;he,</HI> I am per&s;uaded of the Kindne&s;s of your Heart,
which is a rare thing among Princes, who would
be re&s;pected by all the World, and love none
but them&s;elves; but you &s;hew me this Rule is not
general. I make great account of the Attachment
you have for a little White Cat, that in the main
is fit for nothing but to catch Mice.&endq; At that the
Prince ki&s;s'd her Paw, and went away.</P>
<P>It is almo&s;t incredible to believe the ha&s;te he
made, were we unacquainted with the Swiftne&s;s
of the wooden Hor&s;e, who carried him before five
hundred thou&s;and Leagues in le&s;s than two days;
and the &s;ame Power that animated him, had &s;o great
an effect upon the others, that he was not above
four and twenty Hours upon the Road, and never
<PB N="265" REF="274">
&s;topt till he arrived at the King's Palace, where
his two Brothers had got before him; who &s;eeing
he was not come, rejoiced at his Negligence, and
&s;aid to one another, &startq;How fortunate is this, he is
either &s;ick or dead, and will not come to rival
us in this important bu&s;ine&s;s.&endq; Thereupon they
pulled out their Webs, which were indeed very
fine, and pa&s;s'd them thro the Eye of a large Nee|dle,
but not a &s;mall one; which Pretext of Refu&s;al
the King embracing, went and fetch'd the Needle
he propo&s;ed, which the Magi&s;trates, by his order,
had carried to the Trea&s;ury, and lock'd up care|fully.
This Refu&s;al rai&s;ed a great Murmuring;
tho&s;e that were Friends to the Princes, and parti|cularly
the elde&s;t, who&s;e Web was the fine&s;t, &s;aid
it was all a Trick and Eva&s;ion: and the King's
Creatures maintain'd, that he was not obliged to
keep any other Conditions than what were propo|&s;ed;
when, to put an end to this Difference, there
was heard a Sounding of Trumpets and Hautboys,
which came before our Prince.</P>
<P>The King and his Sons were all &s;urprized at this
Magnificence. The Prince, after he had re&s;pect|fully
&s;aluted his Father, and embraced his Bro|thers,
took out of a Box cover'd with Rubies, a
Walnut, which he crack'd, thinking to find the
Web &s;o much boa&s;ted of; but only &s;aw a &s;mall Ha|zel-Nut,
which he crack'd al&s;o, and, to his &s;ur|prize,
found only a Kernel of Wax. The King
and every body laugh'd to think, that the Prince
&s;hould be &s;o credulous as to think to carry a Web
of Cloth in a Nut; but had they recollected them|&s;elves,
they might have remember'd the little Dog
that lay in an Acorn. However, he peal'd the
Kernel, and nothing appear'd but the Pulp it&s;elf,
whereupon a great noi&s;e was heard all over the
Room, every one having it in his mouth what a
fool the Prince was made of; who, for his part, re|turn'd
no An&s;wer to all the Plea&s;antries of the
Courtiers, but broke the Kernel, and found in it a
<PB N="266" REF="275">
Corn of Wheat, and in that a Grain of Millet. At
the &s;ight of this he began to di&s;tru&s;t, and mutter'd
to him&s;elf, <HI>O White Cat, White Cat, thou ha&s;t deceived
me!</HI> And at that in&s;tant he felt a Cat's Paw upon his
Hand, which &s;cratch'd him, and fetch'd Blood; he
knew not whether it was to encourage or di&s;may
him: however, he open'd the Millet-Seed, and to
the amazement of all pre&s;ent, drew out a Web of
Cloth four hundred Yards long; and what was
more wonderful, there were painted on it all &s;orts
of Birds, Bea&s;ts and Fi&s;h, Fruits, Trees and Plants,
Rocks, and all manner of rare Shells of the
Sea; the Sun, Moon, Stars and Planets; and all
the Pictures of all the Kings and Princes of the
World, with tho&s;e of their Wives, Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es and
Children, all dre&s;s'd after the fa&s;hion of their own
Country. When the King &s;aw this Piece of Cloth,
he turn'd as pale, as the Prince was red in looking &s;o
long for it, and the Needle was brought, and it was
put thro five or &s;ix times; all which time the King
and his two Sons were &s;ilent, tho afterwards, the
Beauty and Rarity of the Cloth was &s;o great, they
&s;aid it was not to be match'd in the whole World.
The King fetch'd a deep Sigh, and turning him&s;elf
towards his Children, &s;aid to them; &startq;Nothing gives
me &s;o much comfort in my old Age, as to be &s;en|&s;ible
of the Deference you have for me, which
makes me de&s;irous of putting you to a new Tryal.
Go and travel another Year, and he that brings
me the mo&s;t beautiful Dam&s;el, &s;hall marry her,
and be crown'd King; there being an ab&s;olute
Nece&s;&s;ity that my Succe&s;&s;or &s;hould marry: and I
&s;wear and promi&s;e, I will no longer defer the
Reward.&endq;</P>
<P>Our Prince &s;uffer'd all this Inju&s;tice: The little
Dog and the Web of Cloth rather de&s;erved ten
Crowns than one; but he was of &s;o &s;weet a Di&s;po|&s;ition,
that he would not thwart his Father's Will:
&s;o without any delay he got into his Chariot again,
and with his Train return'd to his dear White Cat,
<PB N="267" REF="276">
who knowing the Day and Moment he would come,
had the Roads &s;trew'd with Flowers. She was laid
on a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Tape&s;try, under a Canopy of Cloth of
Gold, in a Gallery from whence &s;he could &s;ee him
return. He was receive'd by the Hands that always
&s;erved him, and all the Cats climbed upon the Gutter
to congratulate his Return by a Concert of mewing.
&startq;Well, Prince, <HI>&s;aid &s;he to him,</HI> I &s;ee you are come
back without your Crown.&endq; &startq;Madam, <HI>reply'd he,</HI>
by your Bounty I was in a condition of gaining
it, but I am per&s;uaded the King is more loth to
part with it, than I am fond of having it.&endq; &startq;No
matter for that, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> you mu&s;t neglect nothing
to de&s;erve it, I will a&s;&s;i&s;t you on this occa&s;ion;
and &s;ince you mu&s;t carry a beautiful Dam&s;el to
your Father's Court, I will look out for one, who
&s;hall gain you the Prize: but in the interim, let
us be merry, and divert our&s;elves, I have order'd
a Sea-fight between my Cats and the mo&s;t terri|ble
Rats of the Country. My Cats perhaps may
be hard &s;et, for they are afraid of the Water;
however, they will have advantage enough: we
cannot expect it in every thing.&endq; The Prince re|turn'd
her thanks, and &s;aid &s;everal hand&s;ome things
on her Conduct and Prudence. Aferwards they
went upon a Terra&s;s which look'd on to the Sea.
The Cats Ve&s;&s;els con&s;i&s;ted of great pieces of Cork,
on which they floated very commodiou&s;ly; and tho&s;e
of the Rats of Egg-&s;hells joined together. The
Fight was very ob&s;tinate; the Rats threw them|&s;elves
into the Water, and &s;wam better than the
Cats, in&s;omuch that they as often conquer'd, as
they were conquer'd; when <HI>Minagrobis,</HI> the Admi|ral
of the Cats, reduced the Ratti&s;h Race to the
utmo&s;t de&s;pair, by eating up the Admiral of their
Fleet, who was an old experienc'd Rat, that had
made three Voyages round the World in very good
Ships, in which he was neither Captain nor Sailor, but
only a kind of Interloper. But the White Cat was &s;o
politick, that &s;he would not ab&s;olutely de&s;troy the&s;e
<PB N="268" REF="277">
poor unfortunate Rats, thinking that if there were
no Rats nor Mice, her Subjects would live in an
Idlene&s;s that might become prejudicial to her.</P>
<P>The Prince pa&s;s'd this Year, as he had done the
two fir&s;t, in Hunting, Fi&s;hing, and &s;uch Diver&s;ions,
and often at a Game of Che&s;s, which the White
Cat play'd extraordinary well at; but he could not
forbear often que&s;tioning her, to know by what
Miracle &s;he &s;poke. He ask'd her if &s;he was a Fairy,
or if by any Metamorpho&s;is &s;he was turn'd into a
Cat. But as the White Cat was always capable of
&s;aying what &s;he had a mind to, &s;he return'd him an
An&s;wer &s;o in&s;ignificant, that he perceiv'd &s;he was
not willing to communicate this Secret to him.
As nothing pa&s;&s;es away &s;o quick as happy Days, if
the White Cat had not been &s;o careful as to re|member
the time the Prince was to return, 'tis cer|tain
he would have quite forgot it. She told him
of it the night before, and withal, that the hour
of de&s;troying the fatal Work of the Fairies was
come; and therefore he mu&s;t re&s;olve to cut off her
Head and Tail, and throw them pre&s;ently into the
Fire. &startq;What! <HI>cry'd he,</HI> &s;hall I, my lovely White
Cat, be &s;o barbarous as to kill you? You have
undoubtedly a mind to make proof of my Heart,
butbe a&s;&s;ured it is incapable of wanting that
Friend&s;hip and Acknowledgment due to you.&endq;
&startq;No, Prince, <HI>continued &s;he,</HI> I don't &s;u&s;pect you of
Ingratitude, I know your Merit; but neither you
nor I can pre&s;cribe to Fate: do what I de&s;ire
you, we &s;hall hereby be happy; and you &s;hall
know, upon the word of a Cat of Worth and Ho|nour,
that I am really your Friend.&endq; Tears &s;tuck
two or three times in the young Prince's Eyes, to
think he mu&s;t cut off the Head of his pretty Cat,
that had been &s;o kind to him; he &s;aid all that he
could think mo&s;t tender to engage her to di&s;pen&s;e
with him: To which &s;he an&s;wer'd ob&s;tinately, &s;he
would die by his hand, and that was the only way
to hinder his Brother from having the Crown. In
<PB N="269" REF="278">
&s;hort, &s;he pre&s;s'd him &s;o earne&s;tly, that he tremb|ling,
with an un&s;teady hand, cut off her Head and
Tail, and threw them pre&s;ently into the Fire; and
at the &s;ame time &s;aw the mo&s;t charming Metamor|pho&s;is
imaginable. The Body of the White Cat
grew pre&s;ently large, and changed all on a &s;udden
to a fine Lady &s;o accompli&s;h'd, as exceeds de&s;crip|tion.
Her Eyes committed Theft upon all Hearts,
and her Sweetne&s;s kept them; her Shape was ma|je&s;tick,
her Air noble and mode&s;t, her Wit flow|ing,
her Manners engaging; in a word, &s;he was
beyond every thing that was lovely.</P>
<P>The Prince, at the &s;ight of her, was in &s;o agree|able
a Surprize, that he thought him&s;elf inchanted.
He could not &s;peak nor look at her, and his Tongue
was &s;o tied, that he could not explain his Amaze|ment;
which was much greater, when he &s;aw an
extraordinary number of Gentlemen and Ladies,
holding their Cat-Skins over their Shoulders, come
and pro&s;trate them&s;elves at the Queen's feet, to
te&s;tify their Joy to &s;ee her again in her natural
State. She receiv'd them with all the Marks of
Bounty, which &s;ufficiently di&s;cover'd the Sweet|ne&s;s
of her Temper. After having &s;pent &s;ome time
in hearing their Compliments, &s;he order'd them to
retire, and leave her alone with the Prince; to
whom &s;he &s;poke as follows:</P>
<P>Think not, Sir, that I have always been a Cat,
and that my Birth is ob&s;cure. My Father was King
of &s;ix Kingdoms, loved my Mother tenderly, and
gave her liberty to do what &s;he plea&s;ed. Her mo&s;t
prevailing Inclination was to travel, in&s;omuch that
when &s;he was with Child of me, &s;he undertook to
go to &s;ee a Mountain, of which &s;he had heard a
mo&s;t &s;urprizing account. As &s;he was on the Road,
&s;he was told there was nigh the Place &s;he was
then at, an antient Ca&s;tle of Fairies, which was the
fine&s;t in the World, or at lea&s;t &s;aid to be &s;o; for
as no Per&s;on was ever admitted into it, there could
<PB N="270" REF="279">
not be any po&s;itive Judgment pa&s;s'd thereon: but
for the Gardens, they were known to contain the
be&s;t Fruits that ever were eat. The Queen my
Mother, who long'd to ta&s;te of them, went thither.
But when &s;he came to the Gate of this &s;tately Edi|fice,
which &s;hined again with Blue enamell'd with
Gold, nobody came, tho &s;he knock'd a long time;
and her De&s;ire increa&s;ing the more, by rea&s;on of
the Difficulty, &s;he &s;ent for Ladders to &s;cale the
Walls: but they growing vi&s;ibly to a great
height of them&s;elves, they were forced to fa&s;ten
the Ladders to one another, to lengthen them, and
whenever any one went up them, they broke
under their Weight; &s;o that they were either kil|led
or lamed. The Queen was in the utmo&s;t de|&s;pair
to &s;ee Trees loaded with &s;uch delicious Fruits,
and not to ta&s;te of them; which &s;he was re&s;olved
to do, or die: in&s;omuch that &s;he order'd &s;ome rich
Tents to be pitch'd before the Ca&s;tle, and &s;tay'd
there &s;ix Weeks with all her Court. She neither
&s;lept nor eat, but &s;igh'd continually, and was al|ways
talking of the Fruit. In &s;hort, &s;he fell dan|gerou&s;ly
ill, and no Remedy could be found out;
for the inexorable Fairies never appear'd from the
time &s;he came there. All her Court were very
much grieved; there was nought to be heard but
Sighs and Lamentations, while the dying Queen
was continually asking tho&s;e that were in waiting
upon her, for Fruit; but would eat of none but
what came out of this Garden.</P>
<P>One Night, after having got a little &s;leep, when
&s;he awaken'd &s;he &s;aw a little ugly decrepid old
Woman &s;at in an Elbow-chair by her Bol&s;ter, and
was &s;urprized that her Woman &s;hould &s;uffer a
Stranger &s;o near her; when &s;he &s;aid to her, &startq;We
think your Maje&s;ty very importunate to be &s;o
&s;tubborn in your De&s;ires of eating of our Fruit;
but &s;ince your Life is in danger, my Si&s;ters and I
have con&s;ented to give you as much as you can
carry away, and to let you eat of them as long
<PB N="271" REF="280">
as you &s;tay here, provided you will make us one
Pre&s;ent.&endq; &startq;Ah! my good Mother, <HI>cry'd the Queen,</HI>
name it, I will give you my Kingdoms, Heart
and Soul, to have &s;ome of the Fruit; I cannot
buy it too dear.&endq; &startq;We would have your Maje&s;ty,
<HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> give us the Daughter you now bear in
your Womb. As &s;oon as &s;he is born, we will
come and fetch her; &s;he &s;hall be brought up by
us, and we will endow her with all Virtues,
Beauties, and Sciences: in &s;hort, &s;he &s;hall be our
Child, and we will make her happy: But your
Maje&s;ty mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that you mu&s;t never &s;ee her
any more till &s;he is married. If you will agree
to this Propo&s;ition, I will cure you immediately,
and carry you into our Orchards, where, not|with&s;tanding
'tis Night, you &s;hall &s;ee well enough
to chu&s;e what you would have; but if what I
&s;ay di&s;plea&s;es your Maje&s;ty, Good-night.&endq; &startq;Tho
what you impo&s;e on me, <HI>reply'd the Queen,</HI> is very
hard, yet I accept it rather than die; for cer|tainly
if I cannot live, my Child mu&s;t be lo&s;t;
therefore skilful Fairy, <HI>continued &s;he,</HI> cure me, and let
me not be a moment debar'd of the Privileges I
am intitled to thereby.&endq;</P>
<P>The Fairy touched her with a little golden Wand,
&s;aying, &startq;Your Maje&s;ty is free from all Illne&s;s.&endq; And
thereupon &s;he &s;eem'd as if &s;he had thrown off a
heavy Garment that had been very trouble&s;ome and
incommodious to her. She order'd all the Ladies
of her Court to be call'd, and with a gay Air told
them &s;he was extraordinary well, and would ri&s;e,
&s;ince that the Gates of the Fairies Palace, which
were &s;o &s;trongly barrocaded, were &s;et open for her
to eat of the Fruit, and to carry what &s;he plea&s;ed
away. The Ladies thought the Queen delirious,
and that &s;he was then dreaming of the Fruit &s;he
long'd &s;o much for; in&s;omuch, that in&s;tead of re|turning
any An&s;wer they fell a crying, and call'd
in the Phy&s;icians; which Delays put the Queen
into the utmo&s;t de&s;pair: &s;he ask'd for her Clothes,
<PB N="272" REF="281">
and they refu&s;ing her them, put her into a violent
Pa&s;&s;ion, which they look'd upon as her Fever. In
the interim the Phy&s;icians came, who after having
felt her Pul&s;e, and made their Enquiries, could
not deny but that &s;he was in perfect Health. The
Ladies &s;eeing the Fault they had committed thro
their great Zeal, endeavour'd to repair it by dre&s;|&s;ing
her quickly. They every one begg'd her par|don,
which &s;he granted, and ha&s;ten'd to follow the
old Fairy who waited for her. She went into the
Palace, where nothing was wanting to make it
the fine&s;t in the World; which you will the more
ea&s;ily believe, Sir, <HI>added the</HI> (new metamorpho&s;ed)
<HI>Queen,</HI> when I &s;hall tell you 'twas this we are
now in. Two other Fairies not quite &s;o old as &s;he
that conducted my Mother, receiv'd her favourably
at the Gate; &s;he de&s;ired them to carry her pre&s;ent|ly
into the Garden, and to tho&s;e Trees that bore
the be&s;t Fruits. They told her they were all
equally good, and that unle&s;s &s;he would have the
plea&s;ure of gathering them her&s;elf, they would call
them to her. &startq;I beg, <HI>&s;aid the Queen,</HI> that I may
have the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing &s;o extraordinary an
Event.&endq; Whereupon the elder of the three put
her Fingers in her Mouth, and blow'd three times,
and then cry'd, Apricocks, Peaches, Nectarines,
Plumbs, Cherries, Pears, Melons, Grapes, Apples,
Oranges, Lemons, Goo&s;eberries, Currants, Straw|berries,
Rasberries, come all at my Call. &startq;But,
<HI>&s;aid the Queen,</HI> the&s;e Fruits are not all ripe in the
&s;ame Sea&s;on.&endq; &startq;Oh, <HI>&s;aid they,</HI> in our Gardens we
have all &s;orts of Fruit always ripe and good, and
they never dimini&s;h.&endq;</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time they came rolling to them
without any Brui&s;es; and the Queen, who was im|patient
to &s;atisfy her longing, fell upon them, and
took the fir&s;t that offer'd, which &s;he rather de|vour'd
than eat. When her Appetite was &s;omewhat
&s;atisfied, &s;he de&s;ired the Fairies to let her go to
the Trees, and have the plea&s;ure to gather them
<PB N="273" REF="282">
her&s;elf: to which they gave their con&s;ents, but &s;aid
to her at the &s;ame time, You mu&s;t remember the
Promi&s;e you have made us; for you will not be
allow'd to run back from it. &startq;I am per&s;uaded,
<HI>reply'd &s;he,</HI> that it is &s;o plea&s;ant living with you,
and this Palace is &s;o charming, that if I did not
love the King my Husband dearly, I would offer
my&s;elf; therefore you need not fear my retracting
from my word.&endq; The Fairies, who were very
well &s;atisfied, opened the Doors of their Gardens,
and all their Inclo&s;ures; and the Queen &s;tay'd in
them three Days and Nights without ever &s;tirring
out, &s;o delicious &s;he found them. She gather'd
Fruit for her Provi&s;ion, and as they never wa&s;te,
loaded four hundred Mules &s;he brought along with
her. The Fairies added to their Fruit, Baskets of
Gold of curious work to carry them in, and many
other very valuable Rarities. They promi&s;ed to
educate and make me a compleat Prince&s;s, and to
chu&s;e me out an Husband, and to inform my Mo|ther
of the Wedding.</P>
<P>The King was overjoy'd at the Queen's return,
and all the Court expre&s;s'd their plea&s;ure to &s;ee
her again; there were nothing but Balls, Ma&s;que|rades,
and Cour&s;es, where the Fruits the Queen
brought, &s;erv'd for delicious Regales. The King
prefer'd them before all other Things, but knew
not the Bargain &s;he had made with the Fairies, but
often asked her what Country &s;he had been in, to
bring home &s;uch good things; to which &s;he reply'd,
&s;he found them on a Mountain that was almo&s;t in|acce&s;&s;ible;
&s;ometimes that &s;he met with them in a
Valley, and &s;ometimes in the mid&s;t of a Garden or
a great Fore&s;t; all which Contradictions very
much &s;urprized the King. He enquired of tho&s;e
that went with her, but they were all forbid to
tell any thing of the matter. At length the Queen,
when her time was at hand, began to be troubled
at what &s;he had promi&s;ed the Fairies, and grew
very melancholy; &s;he &s;igh'd every Minute, and
<PB N="274" REF="283">
changed her Countenance. The King was very
much concern'd, and pre&s;&s;ed the Queen to declare
what was the cau&s;e; who with &s;ome difficulty told
him what had pa&s;&s;ed between her and the Fairies,
and that &s;he had promi&s;ed them the Daughter &s;he
was then big with. &startq;What, <HI>cry'd the King,</HI> we
have no Children, and could you who know how
much I de&s;ire them, for the eating of two or
three Apples, promi&s;e your Daughter? Certainly
you mu&s;t have no regard for me.&endq; And thereupon
he loaded her with a thou&s;and Reproaches, which
made my poor Mother almo&s;t ready to die for
grief: But not content with this, he put her into
a Tower under a &s;trong Guard, where &s;he could
have no Conver&s;ation but with the Officers that
were appointed to attend her. The ill Corre&s;pon|dence
between the King and Queen put the Court
into the utmo&s;t Con&s;ternation: they laid a&s;ide their
rich Clothes, and put on &s;uch as were agreeable
to the general Sorrow. The King appear'd for
his part inexorable, and wou'd not &s;ee the Queen;
but as &s;oon as I was born made me be brought in|to
his Palace to be nur&s;ed there, while my Mother
at the &s;ame time remain'd a Pri&s;oner, and in an ill
&s;tate of Health. The Fairies, who were not igno|rant
all this while of what pa&s;t, and who look'd
upon me as their own Property, were &s;o provoked,
that they re&s;olved to have me; but before they had
recour&s;e to their Art, they &s;ent Amba&s;&s;adors to the
King, to de&s;ire him to &s;et the Queen at liberty,
and to re&s;tore her to his Favour again; and like|wi&s;e
to demand me, that I might be nur&s;ed and
brought up by them. The Amba&s;&s;adors were &s;o
little and deformed, for they were Dwarfs, that
the King in&s;tead of granting what they ask'd, re|fu&s;ed
them rudely, and if they had not got away
quickly, might have &s;erved them wor&s;e.</P>
<P>When the Fairies were inform'd of my Father's
Proceeding, they were &s;o enrag'd, that after they
had &s;ent all the Plagues capable of rendring his
<PB N="175" REF="284">
&s;ix Kingdoms de&s;olate, they let loo&s;e a terrible
Dragon that poi&s;on'd all the Places wherever he
came; devour'd Men, Women, and Children, and
kill'd all Trees and Plants with the breath of his
No&s;trils. The King finding him&s;elf reduc'd to this
Extremity, con&s;ulted all the Sages of his Kingdom
to know what he &s;hould do to pre&s;erve his Subjects
again&s;t the&s;e Misfortunes, wherewith they were
&s;o much oppre&s;s'd: They advi&s;ed him to &s;end for
the be&s;t Phy&s;icians to pre&s;cribe the mo&s;t excellent
Remedies, as one means; and to pardon all Crimi|nals
that were condemn'd to die, if they would
fight with the Dragon, as the other. The King,
who was well enough plea&s;ed with this Advice,
put it in execution, but received no benefit by it;
for the Mortality continued, and none fought with
the Dragon but were devour'd: in&s;omuch, that at
la&s;t he had recour&s;e to a Fairy who had protected
him from his Youth, and who was &s;o old that &s;he
hardly ever ro&s;e from off her Seat. He went to
her, and reproached her for permitting his Fate to
per&s;ecute him in &s;uch a manner without giving him
&s;ome A&s;&s;i&s;tance. &startq;What would you have me do,
<HI>reply'd the Fairy,</HI> you have provoked my Si&s;ters,
who have equal Power with me, and we &s;eldom
act one again&s;t another; therefore think of ap|pea&s;ing
them by giving your Daughter, &s;ince they
have a Right to her; &s;et the Queen at liberty,
who is too good and amiable to be u&s;ed &s;o ill, and
re&s;olve to fulfil what &s;he has promi&s;ed, and then
I'll a&s;&s;ure you, you &s;hall be happy.&endq; The King, my
Father, loved me dearly; but &s;eeing no other way
to pre&s;erve his Kingdoms, and to be delivered from
the fatal Dragon, told his Friends that he would
believe her, and would give the Fairies his Daugh|ter,
&s;ince &s;he had a&s;&s;ured him I &s;hould be taken
care of, and treated as became a Prince&s;s of my
Birth, and relea&s;e the Queen; and withal de&s;ired
her to tell him how he might &s;end me to the Fairy
&startq;Ca&s;tle,&endq; &startq;You mu&s;t carry her, <HI>&s;aid the Fairy,</HI> in a
<PB N="276" REF="285">
Cradle to the Mountain of Flowers, and mu&s;t &s;tay
there-abouts to &s;ee what happens.&endq; The King told
her, &s;he might acquaint her Si&s;ters that he and the
Queen would go with me there in eight days time,
and that they might do with me what they thought
proper.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he came back to the Palace, he &s;ent
for the Queen with as much Love and Tenderne&s;s,
as he had made her a Pri&s;oner with Anger and
Pa&s;&s;ion; but &s;he was &s;o fallen away and alter'd,
that he could hardly know her, if he had not
been very certain &s;he was the Per&s;on he once &s;o
much doated on. He begg'd of her, with Tears in
his Eyes, to forget the ill Treatment &s;he had re|ceiv'd
from him, which he promi&s;ed her &s;hould be
the la&s;t. She an&s;wer'd, that &s;he brought it upon
her&s;elf by her Imprudence, in promi&s;ing her Child
to the Fairies; and that if any thing would plead
her excu&s;e, it was the condition &s;he was then in.
In &s;hort, he declared his de&s;ign to her of putting
me into their hands, which &s;he oppo&s;ed, and it
&s;eem'd as if it was my Fate to be always the cau&s;e
of my Father and Mother's di&s;agreeing: But after
&s;he had cry'd and taken-on &s;ome time, without
obtaining what &s;he de&s;ired, (for my Father too
well fore&s;aw the fatal Con&s;equences, and his Sub|jects
&s;till dying as if they had been guilty of our
Faults) &s;he con&s;ented, and Preparations were made
again&s;t the Ceremony. I was put into a Cradle of
Mother of Pearl, adorn'd as much as po&s;&s;ible by
Art, with Garlands of Flowers and Fe&s;tons hung
round about it, and the Flowers &s;o intermixt with
Jewels of &s;everal Colours, that when the Sun re|flected
upon them, they gave &s;uch a lu&s;tre as daz|zled
the Eyes. The Magnificence of my Dre&s;s ex|ceeded,
if that was po&s;&s;ible, my Cradle. All the
Bands and Rolls of my Swadling-Clouts were
buckled with large Pearls, four and twenty&punc; Prin|ce&s;&s;es
of the Blood carried me on a kind of a light
Litter, all dre&s;s'd in white to re&s;emble my Inno|cence,
<PB N="277" REF="286">
and were follow'd by the whole Court ac|cording
to their Ranks. While they were going
up the Mountain, they heard a melodious Symphony;
and afterwards the Fairies appear'd to the number
of &s;ix and thirty, for the three had invited all their
Friends, each in a Shell of Pearl as large as that
wherein <HI>Venus</HI> aro&s;e out of the Sea, and drawn by
Sea-hor&s;es, in as great Pomp as if they had been
the fir&s;t Queens in the World. They were exceed|ing
old and ugly: they carry'd in their hands Olive-Branches,
to &s;ignify to the King, that by his Sub|mi&s;&s;ion
he had gain'd their Favour. When they
took me, it was with &s;uch extraodinary Care&s;&s;es,
that it &s;eem'd as if they lived only to make me happy.</P>
<P>The Dragon, which was the In&s;trument of their
Revenge again&s;t my Father, follow'd them bound
in Chains of Diamonds. They took me in their
Arms, care&s;s'd me a thou&s;and times, endow'd me
with &s;everal Gifts, and then fell to dancing; and
'tis almo&s;t incredible to believe how the&s;e old Wo|men
jump'd and skip'd. Afterwards the devouring
Dragon came forwards, the three Fairies to whom
my Mother promi&s;ed me, placed them&s;elves upon
him, and &s;et my Cradle between them; then &s;tri|king
the Dragon with a Wand, he pre&s;ently di&s;|play'd
his large Wings, which were as thin and
fine as Gawze, and intermix'd with various Colours,
and carried them to their Ca&s;tle. My Mother &s;ee|ing
me in the Air upon this furious Dragon, could
not forbear &s;hrieking out, while the King com|forted
her by the a&s;&s;urance his Friend had given
him, that no ill Accident &s;hould befal me; and
that I &s;hould have as great care taken of me as if
I was in their own Palace: which a&s;&s;urance ap|pea&s;ed
her, tho &s;he was very much grieved to lo&s;e
me for &s;o long a time; e&s;pecially when &s;he reflec|ted
that &s;he her&s;elf was the cau&s;e of it. You mu&s;t
know, Prince, <HI>continued &s;he,</HI> that my Guardians built
a Tower on purpo&s;e for me, wherein there were a
thou&s;and beautiful Apartments for all the Sea&s;ons
of the Year, furni&s;h'd with magnficent Goods, and
<PB N="278" REF="287">
agreeable Books; but there were no Doors, and no
other coming in but at the Windows, which were
prodigious high. It was &s;urrounded by beautiful
Gardens full of Flowers, and embeli&s;h'd with Foun|tains
and Arbours of Greens, where it was cool
and plea&s;ant in the hotte&s;t Sea&s;ons. Here the Fai|ries
brought me up, and took more care of me than
every they promi&s;ed the Queen to do. My Clothes
were &s;o fa&s;hionable and fine, that if any one had
&s;een me, they would have thought it had been
my Wedding-day. They taught me all that was
proper for one of my Age and Birth to learn, and
they had not much trouble with me, for there
was nothing but what I comprehended with great
ea&s;e. They were very well plea&s;ed at my ready
Di&s;po&s;ition, and if I had never &s;een any body be|&s;ides
them, I &s;hould have been contented to have
lived there all my Life. They came very often to
&s;ee me, mounted upon the &s;ame dreadful Dragon I
have already &s;poke of; they never mentioned the
King or Queen to me, but call'd me their Daugh|ter,
and I thought my&s;elf really &s;o. No Creature
lived with me in this Tower but a Parrot and a
little Dog, which were endow'd both with Rea&s;on
and Speech, and were given to divert me.</P>
<P>One Side of the Tower was built upon a hollow
Road, &s;er full of Elms and other Trees, which
&s;haded it &s;o much, that I never &s;aw any one&punc; pa&s;s
by while I was there; when one day, as I was at
the Window talking to my Parrot and Dog, I
heard a noi&s;e, and looking about, perceiv'd a young
Gentleman, who &s;topt to hear our Conver&s;ation.
I had never &s;een one before but in Paintings, and
was not &s;orry that this Accident had given me the
opportunity; in&s;omuch, that not mi&s;tru&s;ting the
danger we run in the Satisfaction we receive by
the &s;ight of &s;o lovely an Object, I look'd at him
again, and the more I look'd, the more plea&s;ed I
was. He made me a low Box, fix'd his Eyes on
me, and &s;eem'd concern'd to know how to talk
to me; for my Window being a great height, he
<PB N="279" REF="288">
was afraid of being heard, knowing that it was a
Ca&s;tle which belong'd to Fairies. Night came upon
us all on a &s;udden, or, to &s;peak more properly, be|fore
we perceiv'd it; he &s;ounded his Horn twice
or thrice, which he thought to plea&s;e me with,
and then went away without my di&s;covering which
way he took, it was &s;o dark. I remain'd thought|ful;
the Plea&s;ure I u&s;ed to take in talking to my
Parrot and Dog, was no ways agreeable. They
&s;aid all the pretty things that could be to me, for
the&s;e were very witty: but my Thoughts were
otherwi&s;e engaged, and I had not Art enough to
di&s;&s;emble. My Parrot ob&s;erved all my Actions, but
made no mention of what he thought. The next
Morning I ro&s;e with the Sun, and run to my Win|dow,
where I was mo&s;t agreeably &s;urprized to &s;ee
my Spark, who was dre&s;s'd magnificently; in which
I flatter'd my&s;elf I had &s;ome &s;hare, and was not
mi&s;taken. He &s;poke to me through a Speaking-Trumpet,
told me he had been till that in&s;tant in|&s;en&s;ible
to all the Beauties he had beheld, but found
him&s;elf &s;o &s;en&s;ibly touched with me, that he could
not live without &s;eeing me. I was mightily pleas'd
with his Compliment, but vex'd that I dur&s;t not
make &s;ome Reply, for I mu&s;t have bawled out with
all my might, and run the ri&s;que of being heard
&s;ooner by the Fairies than him. I threw him &s;ome
Flowers I had in my hand, which he took for &s;o
&s;ignal a Favour, that he ki&s;s'd them &s;everal times,
and thank'd me. He ask'd me afterwards if I ap|proved
of his coming every day at the &s;ame Hour
under my Window, and if I did, to throw &s;ome|thing;
whereupon I pre&s;ently pull'd off a Turquoi&s;e-Ring
that I had on my Finger, and ca&s;t it at him,
making a &s;ign for him to be gone pre&s;ently, be|cau&s;e
I heard the Fairy <HI>Violenta</HI> coming on the
Dragon to bring me my Breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Words &s;he &s;poke, when &s;he enter'd my
Chamber, were; &startq;I &s;mell the Voice of a Man,
&s;earch, Dragon.&endq; Alas! what a condition was I
in! I was ready to die with fear, le&s;t he &s;hould
<PB N="280" REF="289">
find out, and follow my Lover. &startq;Indeed, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI>
my good Mamma, (for the Fairy would be called
&s;o) you banter, when you &s;ay you &s;mell the Voice
of a Man; can any one &s;mell a Voice? and &s;hould
it be &s;o, what Wretch could be &s;o bold as to
venture coming up into this Tower?&endq; &startq;What you
&s;ay, is very true, Child, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> I am overjoy'd to
hear you argue &s;o well, I fancy 'tis the Hatred I
have again&s;t Men, that makes me think them nigh
when they are not; however, I have brought you
your Breakfa&s;t and a Di&s;taff, be &s;ure &s;pin, ye&s;terday
you did nothing, and my Si&s;ters are very angry.&endq;
Upon my word, I was &s;o taken up with this Stranger,
that I was not able to work. As &s;oon as her back
was turn'd, I threw away my Di&s;taff, and went upon
the Terra&s;s, to look as far as my Eye would carry,
in an excellent Spying-Gla&s;s I had; by which, after
having look'd about &s;ome time, I di&s;cover'd my Lo|ver
laid under a rich Pavillion of Cloth of Gold,
on the top of a high Mountain, &s;urrounded by a
numerous Court. I doubted not but that he was
&s;ome neighbouring King's Son, and was afraid, le&s;t
when he came to the Tower again, he &s;hould be
found out by the terrible Dragon; I went and
fetch'd my Parrot, and bid him fly to that Moun|tain,
to de&s;ire him from me not to come again, be|cau&s;e
I was afraid my Guardian &s;hould di&s;cover it,
and he &s;hould come into danger. My Parrot ac|quitted
him&s;elf of his Commi&s;&s;ion, and &s;urprized
all the Courtiers, to &s;ee him come upon full wing,
and perch upon the Prince's Shoulder, and whi&s;per
him &s;oftly in the Ear. The Prince was both over|joy'd
and troubled at this Me&s;&s;age. My Care flat|ter'd
his Pa&s;&s;ion, but the difficulty there was in
&s;peaking to me, gave him as much Chagrin. He
ask'd the Parrot a thou&s;and Que&s;tions, and the
Parrot him as many, for he was naturally inqui&s;i|tive.
The Prince, in return for my Turquoize,
&s;ent me a Ring of another, but much finer than
mine, cut in the &s;hape of a Heart, and &s;et round
with Diamonds; and told him, (that he might treat
<PB N="281" REF="290">
him more like an Amba&s;&s;ador) he would pre&s;ent
him with his Picture, which he might &s;hew to his
charming Mi&s;tre&s;s: the Picture was tied under his
Wings, and the Ring he brought in his Bill.</P>
<P>I waited for the Return of my green Courier,
with an Impatience unknown to me till then. He
told me the Per&s;on I &s;ent him to was a great King,
who had receiv'd him with all the Joy po&s;&s;ible,
that I might a&s;&s;ure my&s;elf he lived only for me;
and that tho it was very dangerous for him to
come &s;o low as my Tower, yet he was re&s;olved to
hazard all to &s;ee me. This News had &s;uch an ef|fect
upon me, that I fell a crying; my Parrot and
Dog comforted me the be&s;t they could, for they
loved me tenderly, and then my Parrot deliver'd
the Prince's Ring to me, and &s;hew'd me his Pic|ture.
I mu&s;t own I was overjoy'd, that I could
view &s;o nigh a Per&s;on I had never &s;een, but at a
di&s;tance. He appear'd much more lovely than he
&s;eem'd, and the different Thoughts this &s;ight in|&s;pir'd
me with, for &s;ome were agreeable to me,
and others not, made me very unea&s;y; which the
Fairies, when they came to &s;ee me, di&s;cover'd:
they &s;aid one to another, that I was certainly trou|bled
at &s;omething, and that they mu&s;t think of pro|viding
a Husband for me of the Fairy Race. They
named &s;everal, but at la&s;t pitch'd on the little King
<HI>Migonnet,</HI> who&s;e Kingdom lay above five hundred
Leagues off from their Palace, but that was of no
great importance. My Parrot heard all their Di&s;|cour&s;e,
and came to give me an account. &startq;Alas!
my dear Mi&s;tre&s;s, <HI>&s;aid my Bird,</HI> how much I pity
you, if you &s;hould be King <HI>Migonnet</HI>'s Queen!
He is enough to fright you, which I am &s;orry to
tell you; but one thing I am &s;ure of, the King who
loves you, &s;corns to have &s;uch a one for his Foot|boy:
and I think, <HI>continued he,</HI> if I am not much
mi&s;taken, I have perch'd upon the &s;ame Bough
with him.&endq; &startq;How do you mean, <HI>reply'd I,</HI> on the
&s;ame Bough?&endq; &startq;Why, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> he has Feet like
an Eagle.&endq; I was very much afflicted at this ac|count,
<PB N="282" REF="291">
I look'd on the charming Picture of the
young King, and fancy'd he only gave it my Par|rot,
that I might have an opportunity of &s;eeing it;
but when I compared it with <HI>Migonnet,</HI> I lo&s;t all
hopes of Life, and re&s;olved to die, &s;ooner than
marry him. I &s;lept not all the night, but talked
with my Parrot and Dog, and towards morning
began to clo&s;e my Eyes. My Dog, who had a good
No&s;e, &s;melt the King at the foot of the Tower;
he awaken'd the Parrot, and &s;aid to him, &startq;I'll en|gage
the King is below.&endq; To which the Parrot
made an&s;wer, &startq;Hold thy tongue, thou prating Fool,
becau&s;e thy Eyes and Ears are always open, you
are vex'd that any body el&s;e &s;hould have any re&s;t.&endq;
&startq;Well, <HI>&s;aid the Dog,</HI> I am &s;ure he is:&endq; &startq;And, <HI>reply'd
the Parrot,</HI> I am &s;ure he is not; for I have, from
my Mi&s;tre&s;s, forbid him from coming.&endq; &startq;You talk
finely of your forbidding him, <HI>cry'd the Dog;</HI> a Man
in Love con&s;ults nothing but his Pa&s;&s;ion.&endq; There|upon
pulling the Parrot by the Tail, he made &s;uch
a noi&s;e, that I awoke. They told me of their Di&s;|pute;
I ran, or rather flew to the Window, whence
I &s;aw the King holding out his Arms, who, by his
Trumpet, told me he could not live without me,
that he po&s;&s;e&s;s'd a flouri&s;hing Kingdom, and con|jured
me to find out &s;ome way to e&s;cape from my
Tower, or to let him to come to me, calling Hea|ven,
and all the Elements, to witne&s;s that he
would marry me, and make me his Queen. I bid
my Parrot go and tell him, that what he de&s;ir'd
&s;eem'd to me almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible; that however, up|on
the Word he had given, and Oaths he had &s;wore
to me, I would endeavour to accompli&s;h his De|&s;ires:
but withal, to conjure him not to come every
day, le&s;t he &s;hould be di&s;cover'd, which might
prove fatal to us both.</P>
<P>He went away, overjoy'd with the flattering
hopes I gave him. I found my&s;elf in the utmo&s;t
Confu&s;ion, when I reflected on what I had pro|mi&s;ed.
I knew not how one &s;o young, timorous,
and unexperienced, &s;hould get out of a Tower, to
<PB N="283" REF="292">
which there were no Doors, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance on|ly
of a Dog and a Parrot; therefore I re&s;olved not
to attempt a thing in which I could never &s;ucceed,
and &s;o &s;ent my Parrot to acquaint the King with it:
who was for killing him&s;elf that minute, but at
la&s;t charged the Parrot to per&s;uade me to it, and
to come and &s;ee him die, or bring him &s;ome Com|fort.
To which my winged Amba&s;&s;ador an&s;wer'd,
that he was very well per&s;uaded his Mi&s;tre&s;s only
wanted the Power. When he gave me an account
of what had happen'd, I was more grieved than
ever. The Fairy <HI>Violenta</HI> came, and found my Eyes
&s;well'd and red; &s;he told me I had been crying,
and if I did not tell her the rea&s;on, &s;he would
burn me. I an&s;wer'd trembling, I was weary with
&s;pinning, and that I had a great de&s;ire to make
&s;ome Nets to catch &s;ome Birds, that de&s;troy'd the
Fruit in the Garden. &startq;What you de&s;ire, Child,
<HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> &s;hall co&s;t you no more Tears, I will bring
you Materials enough to-night; but I would ra|ther
you thought le&s;s of working, and more of
&s;etting off your Beauty, becau&s;e King <HI>Migonnet</HI>
will be here in a few days.&endq; I &s;igh'd at this News,
but made no Reply; but as &s;oon as her back was
turn'd, began two or three Rows of my Nets, and
afterwards apply'd my&s;elf to the making of a Lad|der
of Ropes. But as the Fairy had not furni&s;h'd
me with as much as I wanted, which obliged me
to ask for more, &s;he told me my Work was like
<HI>Penelope</HI>'s Web, it went not forwards, and yet I
teazed her for more Stuff. &startq;O good Mamma! <HI>&s;aid
I,</HI> you may &s;ay what you plea&s;e; but you mu&s;t
know, that as I am not very ready at this Work,
I burn it when it does not plea&s;e me.&endq; With
which Excu&s;e &s;he &s;eem'd &s;atisfy'd, and left me.</P>
<P>I &s;ent my Parrot that night to bid the King come
under my Window, where he &s;hould find a Ladder,
and to tell him he &s;hould know more when he
came; in &s;hort, I had tied it very fa&s;t, and was de|termin'd
to e&s;cape with him by this means: but
he, as &s;oon as he &s;aw it, without waiting for my

coming down, mounted up in ha&s;te, and threw
him&s;elf into my Chamber, as I was making every
thing ready for my Flight. I was &s;o overjoy'd to
&s;ee him, that I forgot the Danger we were in. He
renew'd all his Oaths, and intreated me to defer
his Happine&s;s no longer; we made my Parrot and
Dog the Witne&s;&s;es to our Marriage, which was the
mo&s;t private in the world for Per&s;ons of our Rank,
and none certainly were ever better &s;atisfied. The
King left me before day; I told him of the Fairies
de&s;ign to marry me to <HI>Migonnet,</HI> and gave him a de|&s;cription
of his mean and &s;orry Figure, for which
his Horror was as great as mine. As &s;oon as he
was gone, the Hours &s;eem'd like Years, I ran to
the Window, and follow'd him with my Eyes, not|with&s;tanding
the Darkne&s;s: But how great was my
Surprize, to &s;ee a fiery Chariot, drawn in the Air
by &s;ix winged Salamanders, which flew &s;o &s;wift,
that the Eye was not able to follow them. This
Chariot was attended by a great many Guards, all
mounted on O&s;triches. I did not give my&s;elf time
to think, that it was <HI>Migonnet</HI> that was thus traver|&s;ing
the Air, but I believed it was a Fairy or In|chanter.
Soon after, the Fairy <HI>Violenta</HI> came into my
Chamber, and told me &s;he brought me good News,
that my Lover would be with me pre&s;ently, and
bid me prepare my&s;elf to receive him; and with
that gave me fine Clothes and Jewels. &startq;But pray,
<HI>&s;aid I,</HI> who has inform'd you that I want to be
married? I am &s;ure 'tis the farthe&s;t from my
Thoughts; therefore &s;end King <HI>Migonnet</HI> back a|gain,
for I won't put in one Pin more, whether
he think me hand&s;ome or not, I am not for him.&endq;
&startq;Oh, oh! <HI>&s;aid the Fairy again,</HI> little Rebel, little
Empty-Pate, I &s;hall not mind your Raillery, but I
&s;hall&mdash;&endq; &startq;What will you do? <HI>reply'd I, enrag'd
at the Names &s;he had call'd me:</HI> Can any one be
wor&s;e &s;erved than I am, to live all my Days im|mur'd
with a Parrot and a Dog, and to be vi&s;ited
con&s;tantly by that frightful Dragon?&endq; &startq;Ha! In|grate!
<HI>&s;aid the Fairy,</HI> is this all we de&s;erve for our
<PB N="285" REF="296">
Care and Pains? I have told my Si&s;ters but too
often, we &s;hould have but &s;orry Recompence.&endq; At
that &s;he went away, and told them of our Diffe|rence,
which put them into no little Amazement.</P>
<P>My Parrot and Dog remon&s;trated to me, that if
I &s;hould continue any longer thus &s;turdy, they fore|&s;aw
that I &s;hould undergo &s;ome Misfortune. But
I was &s;o proud of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the Heart of a King,
that I de&s;pi&s;ed both the Fairies, and the Advice of
tho&s;e my little Companions. I would not dre&s;s me,
but &s;trove all I could to tumble my Head-dre&s;s, that
I might appear le&s;s agreeable to <HI>Migonnet.</HI> We had
an Interview upon the Terra&s;s, he came in his
fiery Chariot; but of all Dwarfs, he was the lea&s;t
I ever &s;aw in my life. His Feet were like an Ea|gle's,
and clo&s;e to his Knees, for Legs he had none.
His Royal Garment was not above half a Yard long,
and trail'd one third part upon the Ground. His
Head was as big as a Peck, and his No&s;e long e|nough
for twelve Birds to perch on it, and be re|galed
at the &s;ame time with a delightful Bu&s;h, for
his Beard was large enough for Canary-Birds to
build their Ne&s;ts in: And for his Ears, they reach'd
a foot above his Head, but were a great part hid
by a high Crown that he wore, to appear the more
grand. The Flame of his Chariot coddled the
Fruit, withered the Flowers, and dryed up the
Fountains of my Gardens. He came with open
Arms to embrace me, and I &s;tood upright, which
obliged his fir&s;t E&s;quire to hold him up; as &s;oon as
he came near me, I ran to my Chamber, and fa|&s;ten'd
my Window: &s;o that <HI>Migonnet</HI> enraged, was
forced to retire to the Fairies, who ask'd a thou|&s;and
pardons for the Affront; and to appea&s;e him,
becau&s;e he was powerful, they re&s;olved to bring
him at night into my Chamber, and while I was
a&s;leep, to tie my hands and feet, and put me into
his Chariot. Things being thus agreed on, they
only chided me for what I had done, and char|ged
me to think of making him amends for the
future. Which Mildne&s;s of their &s;urprized my
<PB N="286" REF="297">
Parrot and Dog, who told me their Hearts mi&s;gave
them, for they knew the Fairies to be &s;trange ill-temper'd
&s;ort of old Ladies, and e&s;pecially <HI>Violenta.</HI>
I laugh'd at their Fears, and waited with the ut|mo&s;t
impatience for my dear Husband, who&s;e De|&s;ires
to &s;ee me again were no le&s;s violent; I threw
out the Ladder of Ropes, re&s;olving to e&s;cape with
him, he came &s;oftly up it, and &s;aid a thou&s;and kind
things, which I dare not recall to my remembrance.</P>
<P>While we were talking together, with the &s;ame
tranquillity as if we had been in his own Palace,
we &s;aw all on a &s;udden the Windows broke open,
and the Fairies enter upon their frightful Dragon,
follow'd by <HI>Migonnet</HI> in his fiery Chariot, and all
his Guards on O&s;triches. The King, without any
di&s;may, clapt his Hand on his Sword, and thought
of &s;ecuring and protecting me; when the&s;e barba|rous
Creatures &s;et their Dragon upon him, which
devoured him before my face. Vex'd and in de|&s;pair,
I threw my&s;elf into the mouth of this dread|ful
Mon&s;ter, that he might &s;wallow me as he had
done the Prince, who was dearer to me than all
the World be&s;ides. And I had certainly undergone
the &s;ame Fate, but the Fairies, who were more cruel
than the Mon&s;ter, would not permit it, but &s;aid I
mu&s;t be re&s;erved for greater Puni&s;hments; a quick
Death was too mild a one for &s;o ba&s;e a Creature:
whereupon touching me, I found my&s;elf changed
into a white Cat. They conducted me to this
&s;tately Palace, which belonged to my Father, and
turned all the Lords and Ladies into Cats; and for
the re&s;t of his Subjects, left of them only the Hands,
which we &s;ee, and reduced me to that mi&s;erable
Condition you found me: letting me know at the
&s;ame time my Birth, the Death of my Father and
Mother, and that I never &s;hould be relea&s;ed from this
Metamorpho&s;is, but by a Prince that perfectly re|&s;embled
my Husband, whom they deprived me of.
&startq;You, Sir, have that re&s;emblance, the &s;ame Fea|tures,
Air and Voice; I was &s;truck as &s;oon as I
&s;aw you, and was inform'd of all that &s;hould hap|pen
<PB N="287" REF="298">
and am &s;till of all that &s;hall come to pa&s;s:
my Pains will be at an end.&endq; &startq;And &s;hall mine,
fair Queen, <HI>&s;aid the Prince,</HI> be of long duration?&endq;
&startq;I love you, Sir, already more than my Life, <HI>&s;aid
the Queen;</HI> we mu&s;t go to your Father, and know
his Sentiments for me, and whether he will con|&s;ent
to what you de&s;ire.&endq; After this &s;he went
out, the Prince handed her into a Chariot, which
was much more magnificent than that he had, and
then went into it him&s;elf. All the re&s;t of the E|quipage
an&s;wer'd it &s;o well, that the Buckles of
the Hor&s;es Harne&s;&s;es were Diamonds and Emeralds.
I &s;hall &s;ay nothing of their Conver&s;ation, which
mu&s;t be very polite, &s;ince &s;he was not only a great
Beauty, but al&s;o a great Wit; and for the Prince,
he was no ways inferior to her therein: &s;o that all
their Thoughts were bright and lively.</P>
<P>When they came nigh the Ca&s;tle where the Bro|thers
were to meet, the Queen went into a Cage
of Chry&s;tal &s;et in Gold, which had Curtains drawn
about it, that &s;he might not be &s;een, and was car|ried
by hand&s;ome young Men richly clothed. The
Prince &s;taid in the Chariot, and &s;aw his Brothers
walking with two Prince&s;&s;es of extraordinary
Beauty. As &s;oon as they knew him, they came to
receive him, and ask'd him if he had brought a
Mi&s;tre&s;s along with him; to which he an&s;wer'd,
that he had been &s;o unfortunate in all his Journey,
to meet with none, but what were very ugly, but
that he had brought a pretty white Cat. &startq;A Cat,
<HI>&s;aid they, laughing;</HI> what was you afraid that Mice
&s;hould devour our Palace?&endq; The Prince reply'd,
that he was not very wi&s;e in making &s;uch a Pre|&s;ent
to his Father, but it was the greate&s;t Rarity
he could meet with. Afterwards they all bent
their Cour&s;e towards the capital Town. The two
elder Princes and their Prince&s;&s;es went in Cala&s;hes
of blue embo&s;s'd with Gold, with Plumes of white
Feathers upon the Hor&s;es Heads; nothing was finer
than this Cavalcade. The younger Prince follow'd
after, and then the Cage of Chry&s;tal, which every
<PB N="288" REF="299" MS="Y">
body admired. The Courtiers crouded to tell the
King that the Princes were arrived, and brought
mo&s;t beautiful Ladies along with them; which
News was no ways plea&s;ing to the King. The two
elder Princes were very earne&s;t to &s;hew him the
Beauties they had brought, whom he receiv'd kind|ly,
but knew not in who&s;e favour to decide; when
looking on the younge&s;t, &startq;What, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> are you
come by your&s;elf?&endq; &startq;Your Maje&s;ty, <HI>reply'd the
Prince,</HI> will find in this Cage a pretty little Cat,
which mews and plays &s;o &s;weetly, that you will
be very well plea&s;ed with her.&endq; Hereat the King
&s;miled, and was going to open the Cage; but as
&s;oon as he approach'd towards it, the Queen with
a Spring broke it in pieces, and appear'd like the
Sun when he breaks forth from a Cloud. Her fair
Hair was &s;pread upon her Shoulders, and laid in
fine large Rings, and her Forehead was adorn'd
with Flowers. Her Gown was a thin white Gawze,
lin'd with a ro&s;e-colour'd Taffety. She made the
King a low Courte&s;y, who in the Exce&s;s of his
Admiration could not forbear crying out, &startq;This is
the incomparable Fairy who de&s;erves my Crown.&endq;
&startq;Sir, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> I came not to rob you of your
Crown, which you wear &s;o worthily; I was born
Heire&s;s to &s;ix Kingdoms, give me leave to pre&s;ent
one of them to you, and one to either of your
Sons, for which I ask no other Return but your
Friend&s;hip, and this young Prince in Marriage:
three Kingdoms will be enough for us.&endq; The
King and all the Court were not able to expre&s;s
their Joy and Amazement. The Marriages of the
three Princes and their Prince&s;&s;es were celebrated
at the &s;ame time, and the Court &s;pent &s;everal
Months in Plea&s;ures and Diver&s;ions; after which,
they all went to their Dominions, and the White
Cat gain'd as great Honour by her Bounty and Ge|nero&s;ity,
as by her rare Merit and Beauty.</P>
