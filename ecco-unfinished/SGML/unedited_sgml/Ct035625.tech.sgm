<SPEAKER>CAMILLO.</SPEAKER>
<L>To be &s;hort then&mdash;Give it thy hearing, for my
tale is well worthy of it; the&s;e two kings, <HI>Leontes</HI> of
<HI>Sicily,</HI> and <HI>Polixenes</HI> of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> were train'd toge|ther
in their childhoods, and there rooted betwixt
'em &s;uch an affection as cou'd not chu&s;e but branch
as it grew up. One unhappy &s;ummer (and full &s;ix|teen
as unhappy have follow'd it) our <HI>Polixenes</HI> went
to repay <HI>Sicily</HI> the vi&s;itation which he ju&s;tly ow'd
him.&mdash;Mo&s;t royally, and with the utmo&s;t freedom
of &s;ociety, was he entertain'd both by <HI>Leontes,</HI> and
his queen <HI>Hermione;</HI> a lady, who&s;e bodily accom|pli&s;hments
were unparallel'd, but by tho&s;e of her
own mind. The free &s;trokes of youth and gaiety,
in her extended civility to <HI>Polixenes</HI> (pleas'd as &s;he
was to &s;ee her lord delighted) bred in him &s;u&s;picion
of her conduct.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GENT.</SPEAKER>
<P>And that is an evil weed, that once taking root,
needs no manure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAMILLO.</SPEAKER>
<P>I then waited about the per&s;on of <HI>Leontes,</HI> and
was alone thought worthy the participation of his
jealou&s;y. Into my bo&s;om he di&s;gorg'd his mon&s;trous
&s;ecret, with no tenderer an injunction than to take
off his innocent, abu&s;ed gue&s;t, by poi&s;on.</P>

with the grain of my hone&s;ty I did, and have not
&s;ince repented me:&mdash;whi&s;per'd <HI>Polixenes</HI> of the mat|ter&mdash;left
my large fortunes, and my larger hopes
in <HI>Sicily,</HI> and on the very wing of occa&s;ion &s;lew with
<PB N="3" REF="7">
him hither, no richer than my honor; and have
&s;ince been ever of his bo&s;om.</P>

<P>I tremble for the poor queen, left to the injuries
of a powerful king, and jealous husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Scarcely &s;ettled in <HI>Bohemia</HI> here, we are alarm'd
with the arrival of <HI>Paulina</HI> (that excellent matron,
and true friend of her unhappy queen) from whom
we too &s;oon learn how &s;ad a tragedy had been acted
in <HI>Sicily</HI>&mdash;the di&s;honor'd <HI>Hermione</HI> clapp'd up in
pri&s;on, where &s;he gave the king a prince&s;s&mdash;the
child (the innocent milk yet in her innocent mouth)
by the king's command, expos'd; expos'd even on
the de&s;arts of this kingdom;&mdash;our <HI>Polixenes</HI> being
fal&s;ly deem'd the father.</P>

<P>What blacker title will you &s;ix upon him, when
you &s;hall hear that <HI>Hermione,</HI> in her weak condition
(the child-bed privilege deny'd, which belongs to
women of all fa&s;hion) was haul'd out to an open
mockery of trial; that on this inhuman outrage
(her fame being kill'd before) &s;he died&mdash;in the very
pri&s;on where &s;he was deliver'd, died; and that on
her decea&s;e, <HI>Paulina</HI> (who&s;e free tongue was the
<PB N="4" REF="8">
king's living &s;courge, and perpetual remembrancer
to him of his dead queen) fled with her effects, for
&s;afety of her life, to <HI>Bohemia,</HI> here&mdash;I tire
you.</P>

<P>All this did <HI>Leontes,</HI> in defiance of the plain an|&s;wer
of the oracle, by him con&s;ulted at <HI>Delphi;</HI>
which now, after &s;ixteen years occurring to his more
&s;ober thoughts, he fir&s;t thinks it probable, then finds
it true, and his penitence thereupon is as extreme,
as his &s;u&s;picions had been fatal. In the cour&s;e of his
&s;orrows he has, as we are inform'd, twice attempted
on his life; and this is now his goad to the pre&s;ent
expedition; to make all po&s;&s;ible atonement to his
injur'd brother <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and to us the fellow-&s;ufferers
in his wrongs&mdash;we mu&s;t break off&mdash;the king and

griev'd&mdash;</P>

<P>Sir, it is three days &s;ince I &s;aw the prince; what
his happier affairs may be, are to me unknown; but
I have mu&s;ingly noted, he is of late much retir'd
from court, and is le&s;s frequent to his princely exer|ci&s;es
than formerly he hath appear'd.</P>

<SPEAKER>POLIXENES.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have con&s;ider'd &s;o much, <HI>Camillo,</HI> and with &s;ome
care; &s;o far, that I have eyes under my &s;ervice,
which look upon his removedne&s;s; from whom I
have this intelligence, that he is &s;eldom from the

ready to leap out of him&s;elf for joy of his found

lock'd her in embracing, as if he wou'd pin her to
