<HEAD>TO THE HONOURABLE <HI>CONSTANTINE JOHN PHIPPS.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WERE the motives of dedication can|didly acknowledged, perhaps it would appear that authors in general rather intend a compliment to their own vanity, than to that of their patrons. Patron, I flatter my&s;elf, will, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, appear to You too cold and di&s;tant an ex|pre&s;&s;ion; and though I entertain all due re&s;|pect for &s;uperior rank and &s;ituation, and am happy in &s;eizing an opportunity of de|claring to the world that I am honoured with the friend&s;hip of Mr. Phipps, yet never was there an epi&s;tle of this nature, in which mere vanity had a more incon|&s;iderable &s;hare; nor &s;hould I be thus proud of proclaiming my affection for him, were I not convinced of his being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of qualities and accompli&s;hments that would di&s;tingui&s;h and adorn the mo&s;t humble, as well as the mo&s;t elevated &s;ituation.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the mo&s;t familiar inter|cour&s;e, I &s;hould be loth to forfeit in any de|gree the partiality you are plea&s;ed to &s;hew me, by the &s;malle&s;t appearance of flat|tery. But when I do but echo the voice of
<PB N="4" REF="3">
all tho&s;e who are acquainted with your pub|lick or private character; when I barely ob|&s;erve, that in an age of the mo&s;t unbounded di&s;&s;ipation, You have devoted your time to the attainment of all u&s;eful and elegant know|ledge; joining to the mo&s;t amiable di&s;po&s;i|tion the mo&s;t un&s;haken integrity, as well as a thorough acquaintance with the con&s;titu|tion of your country, together with the mo&s;t able and faithful di&s;charge of the duties of your profe&s;&s;ion&mdash;when I ju&s;t faintly &s;ketch the&s;e outlines of your character, it will, I hope, rather be &s;uppo&s;ed that I pre&s;ume to hint to you what the world &s;eems to expect from a young man of fa&s;hion of &s;o great promi&s;e, than that I mean to corrupt you, or degrade my&s;elf, by idle compliment and mean adulation.</P>
<P>Of the Comedy which I now pre&s;ent to you, I will venture to &s;ay but little. It is difficult for any man to &s;peak with a to|lerable grace of him&s;elf, and literary per|formances ought to be their own recom|mendation; yet I will not &s;cruple to confe&s;s, that if I thought it entirely de&s;picable, I would not &s;ollicit your acceptance of it. Three of the great writers, enumerated in the Prologue, Plautus, Terence, and Mar|montel, have contributed to enrich it. A play lately exhibited on the French &s;tage, the Deux Amis of M. Beaumarchais, al&s;o &s;ugge&s;ted &s;ome hints of the fable; but the races of them in this Comedy are &s;o little
<PB N="5" REF="4">
apparent, that if I did not thus acknowledge the &s;ources from which I have drawn, I que&s;tion if the ingenious author him&s;elf would be able to claim his own property.</P>
<P>Did I conceive that this play contained any pa&s;&s;ages unfavourable to liberty, more e&s;pecially the liberty of the pre&s;s, You, Sir, would be one of the la&s;t per&s;ons in the kingdom to who&s;e protection I &s;hould ven|ture to recommend it. The liberty of the pre&s;s is a mo&s;t invaluable privilege; yet that liberty, like every other &s;pecies of li|berty, may be abu&s;ed; and while it remains (as it is to be hoped it ever will remain) unre&s;trained by law, the abu&s;e of it is more peculiarly the object of Comedy, who&s;e pro|vince it is, by whole&s;ome and general &s;a|tire, to correct tho&s;e failings and enormi|ties, of which the law takes no cogni&s;ance. Better were it that thou&s;ands and ten thou|&s;ands of &s;uch in&s;ignificant individuals as my|&s;elf &s;hould be maliciou&s;ly &s;landered, than that &s;acred right of Engli&s;hmen &s;hould be violated or infringed: yet who will ju&s;tify the &s;candalous per&s;onalities (politicks entirely out of the que&s;tion) that di&s;grace our new&s;|papers? It is not however &s;ufficient, it &s;eems, to endure them patiently, without a wi&s;h to interrupt their progre&s;s, but the gentle&s;t retort is enough to &s;et all Grub-Street in an uproar; and the mo&s;t good-humoured ridi|cule of the&s;e illu&s;trious authors is an attack upon the liberty of the pre&s;s:&mdash;a liberty
<PB N="6" REF="5">
which they are zealous to exerci&s;e in its &s;ulle&s;t extent, without allowing any portion of it to their opponents; not con&s;idering that the chief benefit of the liberty of the pre&s;s re&s;ults from its being open to all, and affording a free examination of both &s;ides of every que&s;tion. The very liberty they take, however, they are not willing to give; like a &s;cavenger I &s;aw the other day in the &s;treet, who be&s;pattered every pa&s;&s;enger with the contents of his mud-cart, but &s;ent a volley of cur&s;es after a lady of quality, who hap|pened to &s;pla&s;h him as &s;he drove by in her chariot.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid thus much of my Comedy, in vindication of the freedom I have u&s;ed in in&s;cribing it to You, I will not tre&s;pa&s;s longer on your patience, than to repeat the &s;atisfaction I feel in thus openly te&s;tifying my regard, and that I have the honour to be,</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fable.</SPEAKER>
<P>MAdam, madam, I tell you he is a coxcomb&mdash;an arrant coxcomb, Mrs. Golding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Golding.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is a gentleman&mdash;thoroughly the gentleman, Mr. Fable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, a modern gentleman&mdash;a fine gentle|man&mdash;a race of puppies more pernicious to this country than a breed of wolves would have been.&mdash;A mongrel puppy too; on a wrong &s;cent after plea&s;ure; in chace of the fa&s;hion, but for ever at fault; with vanity in view, and ridicule for a whipper-in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, Mr. Fable, it does not &s;ig|nify talking. You know, you and I could never agree on this matter. I was always for my kin&s;|man's
<PB N="2" REF="9">
keeping the very be&s;t company; and, for my part, I &s;ee no great difference between him and his friends of quality&mdash;Nay, indeed, mongrel, as you are plea&s;ed to call him, &s;ir, the advantage is rather on his &s;ide: he has money without rank, and many of them have rank without money. If Beverley has great goings-out, he has great com|mings-in too; while they keep fine hou&s;es, flaming equipages, and great tables out of nothing at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fab.</SPEAKER>
<P>For which very rea&s;on, Mrs. Golding, he is not upon even terms with them. What has a man of bu&s;ine&s;s to do with men of plea&s;ure? Why is a young banker to live with young no|blemen?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Gold.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why not, Mr. Fable? Is not the bu&s;ine&s;s of the hou&s;e carried on at the polite end of the town? Does not he live in the very centre of per&s;ons of fa&s;hion? And has not he con&s;tant dealings with them?&mdash;Not &s;hut up in Lombard-&s;treet&mdash;within the &s;ound of Bow-bell, or in &s;ight of the Monument&mdash;not cramming turtle and veni&s;on at the King's-Arms, or the London-Tavern&mdash;but ballotted into the Macaroni, and a member of the S$avoir Vivre.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fab.</SPEAKER>
<P>So much the wor&s;e&mdash;&s;o much the wor&s;e, Mrs. Golding&mdash;his father, who was the firm of the hou&s;e, e&s;tabli&s;hed the credit of it by decency and &s;obriety: but dying while Beverley was very young, your husband, Mr. Golding, was received into the part|ner&s;hip as a man of experience, capable of car|rying on the bu&s;ine&s;s to more advantage. He, you know, is now ab&s;ent on nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s abroad. In the mean time, I am left a kind of guardian to Beverley, and have the &s;uperintend|ance of his affairs&mdash;and what account &s;hall I $e likely to give of them, when in&s;tead of making money after the example of his father, he is in|tent on nothing but &s;pending it? Hor&s;es at New|mar&s;tet,
<PB N="3" REF="10">
hounds at Bag&s;hot, a villa, a mi&s;tre&s;s, play, and a round of di&s;&s;ipation among hair|brain'd &s;pendthrifts, wa&s;ting their con&s;titutions be|fore they arrive at maturity, &s;pending their for|tunes before they come to them, granting annui|ties to eat up their e&s;tates, or living upon the &s;ale of po&s;t-obits and rever&s;ions!&mdash;There, madam, there's a picture of a genteel young banker at the we&s;t-end of the town for you; drawn from the life, and coloured after nature; how do you like it, madam?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Gold.</SPEAKER>
<P>A frightful caricature, Mr. Fable! your de&s;criptions are ju&s;t the rever&s;e of that &s;weet flower of a man, the auctioneer over the way. His &s;tyle is enchanting and delicate, elegant as the <HI>or moulu,</HI> or Derby&s;hire petrifications, he &s;ets to &s;ale, and &s;oft as the pencil of Guido, Raphael, or Correggio&mdash;your pictures may be taken from nature; but they are dark!&mdash;dark as the land&s;chapes of Pou&s;&s;in, and wild, and horrible as the views of Salvator Ro&s;a.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, madam, it is the&s;e affected airs, madam, that pervert your under&s;tanding, and make you blind to the danger of your kin&s;man.&mdash;He is in imminent danger of ruin, madam, which will fall upon him, if &s;omething is not &s;peedily done to prevent it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Gold.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what would you have me do, Mr. Fable? All I &s;ay is, that good company is a very good thing, and genteel connexions can never do my kin&s;man any mi&s;chief; and if I had been mi&s;tre&s;s, I never would have re&s;ted till I had got him into parliament.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Into parliament!&mdash;into jail, madam. Is not he at expence enough&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Gold.</SPEAKER>
<P>Expence! Lord, lord! This is a point of oeconomy, &s;ir. Why he would &s;ave above double the charge of bringing him into the hou&s;e
<PB N="4" REF="11">
by the mere po&s;tage of letters.&mdash;Sir Geoffry Kil|derkin got him&s;elf elected for no other purpo&s;e.&mdash;My kin&s;man too would frank him&s;elf whole again.&mdash;And then I am &s;ure he would make an admi|rable figure in a debate.&mdash;Oh, how it would have delighted me to have &s;at among the ladies in the gallery of the hou&s;e&mdash;to have &s;een him upon his $eet, his whole per&s;on hanging over his right leg, his right arm &s;winging to and fro like a pen|dulum, and his tongue running down like a larum!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fab.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, &s;o! you, I fear, are too far gone for whole&s;ome coun&s;el. Beverley, I hope is not quite incorrigible, and &s;ome good may be done upon him. Good morrow to you, madam! I have bu|&s;ine&s;s; good day, madam.</P>

<P>Good night, if you plea&s;e, &s;ir. You may be ju&s;t up, but I have not been to bed yet, being (as you &s;ee) but ju&s;t come from the Pantheon. The ma&s;querade began to grow thin; but my kin&s;|man, who was there, is not come home yet, and may not return for &s;ome time perhaps&mdash;&s;o, once more, good night, good Mr. Fable! I'll endeavour to re|cruit my &s;pirits from the fatigue of the plea&s;ures of the night, and leave you to the bu&s;ine&s;s of the day. Your &s;ervant, &s;ir.</P>

The gay, &s;mart, airy &s;parks, of the we&s;t end of the town, have all taken to bu&s;ine&s;s, and are turned &s;heriffs and aldermen; and the merchants, bankers, and trade&s;men, are your principal per&s;ons of plea&s;ure now-a-days.</P>

<P>I wi&s;h he would make le&s;s u&s;e of his heart, and more of his under&s;tanding, &s;ir. He is as generous as a prince, and he thinks all his ac|quaintance as hone&s;t and generous as him&s;elf.

<P>Indeed! why he is more early than or|dinary, Mr. Handy.</P>
</SP>

<P>The ma&s;querade! Oh, now you have accounted for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Handy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I had &s;ome thoughts of being at the Pantheon my&s;elf, but&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Check.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! at the &s;ixpenny Pantheon at I&s;lington, Mr. Handy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Handy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sixpenny Pantheon! S'death what d'$e mean, &s;ir? do you take me for a little &s;hopkeeping mechanic, or one of your dapper city clerks, that draws his pen from under his ear in the evening, to go and drink tea at Bagnigge Wells or Dob|ney's Bowling Green? No, &s;ir; let me tell you I frequent no diver&s;ions but tho&s;e of per&s;ons of qua|lity. Plays now and then, operas twice a week, and ma&s;querades whenever there are any.&mdash;A lady of my particular acquaintance&mdash;of the fir&s;t fa&s;hion I a&s;&s;ure you, old gentleman,&mdash;had provided me a ticket, and a domino, with a &s;mart hat and fea|ther,
<PB N="8" REF="15">
and diamond button and loop to it.&mdash;But as the devil would have it, my lord du&mdash;zouns, what was I &s;aying?&mdash;Her hu&s;band, I &s;ay, happening to come in at an unfortunate moment, &s;aw the dre&s;s lying in her apartment. My lady&mdash;a devili&s;h clever wo|man upon my &s;oul&mdash;turned it off with a laugh, and told him &s;he had provided them on purpo&s;e for him, in order to &s;urpri&s;e him with a piece of con|jugal gallantry. So away they went to the Pan|theon together, and I was obliged to amu&s;e my|&s;elf with another woman of quality who kept hou&s;e all the evening, to con&s;ole my&s;elf for my di&s;appointment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Check.</SPEAKER>
<P>You imagine I have a large portion of faith, I believe, Mr. Handy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Handy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith!&mdash;Why have I offered to borrow any money of you, you old multiplication-table? Eh!</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>You have not taken that liberty with me, becau&s;e you knew I would lend you none: but you are rather too familiar with your betters me|thinks.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Handy.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are familiar with us, and encourage familiarities on our &s;ide.&mdash;Nay, if you would fol|low my advice, I would engage to make a fortune even for you, old Methu&s;alem!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Check.</SPEAKER>
<P>For me, Mr. Handy!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Handy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, for you, old boy! What do you think now of making love to Mrs. Golding? Her hu&s;band's abroad, you know. Intrigues are the mode, and &s;he loves to be in the fa&s;hion.&mdash;Devil take me, if I don't think &s;he and you would make an excellent <HI>t&ecirc;te-a-t&ecirc;te&mdash;</HI>Shalum and Hilpa! Eh, my old antediluvian.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Check.</SPEAKER>
<P>A truce with your wit, good Mr. Handy; and plea&s;e to let your ma&s;ter know that Mr. Fable de&s;ires to &s;ee him on &s;ome particular bu&s;ine&s;s as
<PB N="9" REF="16">
&s;oon as he is &s;tirring,&mdash;which, perhaps, may be about dinner-time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>They won't &s;tick to you long, I am afraid, young gentleman. Ha, ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Handy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Again! You are trying to copy after old ma&s;ter Fable, I warrant you.&mdash;A &s;ly, dry, queer old buck, that Mr. Fable! He don't much approve of our proceedings, I believe. The people call my ma&s;ter the Macaroni Banker, he &s;ays. <STAGE>(Laugh heard)</STAGE>&mdash;Gad&s;o! yonder my ma&s;ter comes, faith&mdash;and along with him his bo&s;om friend, Mr. Denier&mdash;a &s;nake in his bo&s;om too, if I am not mi&s;taken. I never could endure that &s;hrewd &s;park &s;ince I heard him upon the chapter of vails&mdash;which he never gives to other people's &s;ervants; but, for fear of rai&s;ing the wages at home, &s;uffers them to be taken by his own. A young curmudgeon! wor&s;e than a liquori&s;h old dotard, if po&s;&s;ible.&mdash;What &s;ay you, Grand&s;ire?&mdash;<STAGE>(Laugh again)</STAGE>&mdash;But, hu&s;h! they are here.&mdash;Now you may deliver your errand to him your&s;elf, old gentleman.</P>

<P>Support a character at ma&s;querade! Ab|&s;urd and ridiculous!&mdash;and a vulgar idea too, that never entered the head of a gentleman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Denier.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, my habit gave me no trouble of that &s;ort&mdash;yet I did not wear it from choice, but from convenience. One of the managers of Co|ven-Garden theatre&mdash;for there are about five and forty of them, you know&mdash;lent me the dre&s;s&mdash;and I don't &s;ee why I &s;hould be expected to &s;upport a

character in it any more than tho&s;e who u&s;ually wear it.&mdash;Eh, Beverley?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, to be &s;ure. They who &s;ay the &s;ofte&s;t things, and &s;ucceed mo&s;t with the women, enter into the &s;$irit and genius of the place the mo&s;t happily. Gallantry and intrigue, not wit and hu|mour, are the objects of a ma&s;querade.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Denier.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg your pardon, Beverley. I know more than one or two profe&s;&s;ed jokers, that rehear&s;e their parts for a fortnight before-hand, and write down all the good things they &s;hall &s;ay; but, as ill luck will have it, for want of courage and op|portunity, never utter one of them; and yet, re|&s;olving they &s;hall not be lo&s;t to the world, &s;end them, ready cut and dry, to the news-papers, as having been their extempore &s;allies and ma&s;querade plea&s;antries.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, I know the little haberda&s;hers of &s;mall wit; I know them, Denier, and thank you for your de&s;cription of them.&mdash;But who the deuce was that very elegant-looking woman that lord Robert Sprightly &s;tuck &s;o clo&s;e to for mo&s;t part of the evening? I have a &s;trong notion it was lady Sarah Brilliant&mdash;very like her figure; or Harriot Freelove&mdash;but her&mdash;&s;he's common, you know&mdash;her he would not have followed &s;o warmly.&mdash;Oh, Check, are you there?&mdash;Handy too? <STAGE>(Check <HI>and</HI> Handy <HI>come &s;orward)</HI></STAGE> Have you &s;et my night-things in my bed-chamber?</P>

<P>The account is ready, &s;ir; but Mr. Fable de&s;ires to &s;peak with you as &s;oon as you are up, fir. He is gone into the city, but will return before you are &s;tirring, and has particular bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>

<SP>

<P>That's impo&s;&s;ible. Lady Quaver, who &s;ub&s;cribes to the opera, has lent her box to Mrs. Carlton and Lydia this evening, and I have pro|mi&s;ed to attend them; &s;o we mu&s;t make a &s;hort early dinner at home. You will hardly ri&s;e from table before the <HI>finale.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>Time enough to &s;ee the Heinel walk over the cour&s;e, perhaps: but the places of public di|ver&s;ion do keep mo&s;t di&s;orderly hours to be &s;ure. As to the play-hou&s;es, I &s;carce ever attempt to peep into them. There is no getting a mouthful of tragedy or comedy without baulking one's appetite
<PB N="12" REF="19">
for every thing el&s;e. But Lydia is fond of plays too; and the little prude is &s;o eager and punctual, &s;he is as &s;ure to be at the drawing up of the curtain as if &s;he went to keep places.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Denier.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, after all, you are very partial to my ward, Beverley. She is &s;evere upon your gaiety, and you rally her prudery. You both think it worth while to find fault with each other; and that's a dreadful &s;ymptom, Beverley.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; not &s;o far gone as that neither.&mdash;The girl has &s;ome good natural qualities; but &s;he has not mixed with the world enough.&mdash;She is like one of our Engli&s;h coaches&mdash;made of good &s;tuff, and not ill fa&s;hion'd&mdash;but wants the high Paris varni&s;h, Denier.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Denier.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have a good mind to acquaint her with your compari&s;on.&mdash;She'll varni&s;h you till you ap|pear like lord Ru&s;ty's pictures&mdash;not much the better for it.&mdash;But, apropos to your &s;imile,&mdash;after your coach has &s;et you down to dinner in St. James's Street, can you &s;end it to carry us to the opera?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be &s;ure. They are not put up yet. I'll give orders about it immediately.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Denier.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stay! Suppo&s;e it takes me home then; and I'll tell them your direction.&mdash;I &s;hall hardly get a chair at this time in the morning.</P>

<SPEAKER>Denier.</SPEAKER>
<P>No&mdash;hang it! next week is too &s;oon for it.&mdash;So much of it makes it grow nau&s;eous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>It will be a genteel thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Denier.</SPEAKER>
<P>A genteel ma&s;querade!&mdash;Oh, that's the devil, Beverley. The company at a ma&s;querade &s;hould be almo&s;t as various as the characters they

repre&s;ent.&mdash;Counte&s;&s;es and &s;emp&s;tre&s;&s;es, lords, al|dermen, blacklegs, and Oxonians.&mdash;Make your ma&s;querade too genteel, and it mu&s;t be very dull, Beverley.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>All the fine women in town will be there. It is to be given by the club at Arthur's. I can &s;upply you with tickets.</P>

<P>Still, &s;till, this very approbation &s;erves to reproach me with the impropriety of my late con|duct towards you. I feel it. I reque&s;t your for|givene&s;s of it; and &s;hould be happy to pa&s;s the re&s;t of my life in endeavouring to atone it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lyd.</SPEAKER>
<P>Make no apologies to me, Mr. Beverley; I have no right to expect them, nor has your con|duct rendered them nece&s;&s;ary: mo&s;t young gentle|men who pique them&s;elves on their knowledge of the world, act much in the &s;ame manner as you behaved to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is too true; but it is not the &s;warm of coxcombs that renders them le&s;s impertinent or trouble&s;ome. I ought not to have adopted their contemptuous airs, without being ma&s;ter al&s;o of their tame in&s;en&s;ibility; yet I had youth to plead in excu&s;e for my vanities; and I flatter my&s;elf, that time and reflection&mdash;and another motive that di&s;tracts me when I think of it&mdash;might have ren|dered me an object le&s;s unworthy your compa&s;&s;ion. Calamity has torn the veil from my eyes, and I now &s;ee but too plainly, not only your excellence, but my own imperfections.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lyd.</SPEAKER>
<P>Calamity is a &s;evere ma&s;ter, yet amend|ment can &s;carce be purcha&s;ed too dearly: and as your errors have been venial, your di&s;tre&s;s may be but tran&s;ient; nay, may, perhaps, at la&s;t be the means of your happine&s;s.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>Impo&s;&s;ible! Impo&s;&s;ible! However I may be re&s;tored to affluence, I can never, never ta&s;te of happine&s;s. I have thrown away&mdash;perhaps wan|tonly too&mdash;I have thrown away the jewel that
<PB N="29" REF="36">
&s;hould have been the pride and ble&s;&s;ing of my life.&mdash;Oh, Lydia! the feelings of worldly di&s;tre&s;s are nothing to the agonies of a de&s;pairing affection. My &s;ituation extorts from me what I have hitherto endeavoured to conceal even from my&s;elf. I love you&mdash;I feel I long have loved you&mdash;though wretch and fool enough to be almo&s;t a&s;hamed of a pa&s;|&s;ion in which I ought to have gloried. I am now puni&s;hed for it&mdash;heaven knows, &s;everely puni&s;hed&mdash;perhaps too &s;everely&mdash;by lo&s;ing the very hopes of ever obtaining you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lyd.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not run from one dangerous extreme to another, Mr. Beverley; but guard again&s;t de&s;|pondency, as well as vanity and pre&s;umption. I &s;ee you are much agitated, much dejected; and what it would, perhaps, have been dangerous and unpardonable to have owned to you but ye&s;terday, to-day I &s;hall not &s;cruple to declare. Hurried away, as you were, by a torrent of fa&s;hionable va|nities, and the poor ambition of keeping high company, I thought I could di&s;cern in your mind and di&s;po&s;ition no mean under&s;tanding, nor un|generous principles&mdash;too good for the a&s;&s;ociates you had &s;elected, and too &s;u&s;ceptible not to be in danger from &s;uch &s;ociety. It is no wonder, therefore, if I felt any growing partiality for you, that I endeavoured to re&s;train it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lyd.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am too well acquainted with his charac|ter. His manners, indeed, are lively, and his worldly turn enables him to work him&s;elf into the friend&s;hip of others; e&s;pecially, tho&s;e like your|&s;elf, Mr. Beverley&mdash;of an unde&s;igning open-heart|ed character; in order to avail him&s;elf of their foibles, promote his intere&s;t, and gratify his pe|nury. Rely not too &s;ecurely on the warmth of his profe&s;&s;ions! &s;teady to no point but his intere&s;t, you will find him &s;hifting in his conduct according to the revolutions in your fortune. He &s;eemed at fir&s;t de&s;irous to unite me to you; but now, hearing, I &s;uppo&s;e, of the alteration in your circum&s;tances, and the late remittances in my favour, it is per|fectly agreeable to his &s;entiments, to endeavour to &s;upplant you. As yet, however, he has made me no overtures.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bev.</SPEAKER>
<P>So far then at lea&s;t he is not unfaithful. But Oh, my Lydia! may I interpret your repug|nance to his addre&s;&s;es as an argument in my fa|vour?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Lyd.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have already frankly declared my opinion of your character. It now remains with you to prove the truth of that opinion, and to determine my re&s;olution accordingly. Do but bear up a|gain&s;t adver&s;ity, &s;o as to &s;hew your&s;elf equal to the po&s;&s;ible return of pro&s;perity&mdash;a trial, perhaps, ten times more dangerous&mdash;and be a&s;&s;ured, Mr. Beverley, that with the approbation of my friends, I &s;hall be happy to give every proof of my e&s;teem for &s;o valuable a character.</P>

<P>I don't mean to retain it. Finding Bever|ley in &s;o fair a way of amendment, I have already &s;et another wheel in motion, and (unknown to him) circulated a report of a &s;udden turn of fortune in his favour.</P>

Formerly a young &s;pendthrift was contented with one &s;pecies of prodigality&mdash;but it was re&s;erved for you and your precious a&s;&s;ociates to compound this new medley of folly, this olio of vice and extravagance, at once including the di&s;|&s;olutene&s;s of an abandoned debauchee, the chi|canery of a pettyfogger, and the dirty tricking of a fraudulent &s;tock-jobbing broker.</P>

<BYLINE>Spoken by Mrs. BULKLEY <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On account of the length of this Epilogue, many lines are omitted at the Theatre.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>WHEN plays are o'er, by Epilogue we're able,</L>
<L>Thro' moral &s;trainers, to refine the fable;</L>
<L>Again the field of comedy to glean</L>
<L>From what the author did, or did not mean;</L>
<L>Or, in a gayer mood, on malice bent,</L>
<L>Quite top&s;y-turvy turn the bard's intent.</L>
<L>Shall we, ye criticks, to night's play deride?</L>
<L>Or &s;hall we, ladies, take the milder &s;ide?</L>
<L>Suppo&s;e for once we leave the beaten road,</L>
<L>And try, by turns, the har&s;h and gentle mode;</L>
<L>A kind of critick country-dance begin;</L>
<L>Right hand and left, cro&s;s over, figure in!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The critick fir&s;t &s;trikes off, condemns each &s;cene,</L>
<L>The tale, the bard, and thus he vents his &s;pleen:</L>
<L>"While books lie open on each mouldy &s;tall,</L>
<L>Bills plai&s;ter po&s;ts, &s;ongs paper ev'ry wall,</L>
<L>At ev'ry corner hungry minds may feed,</L>
<L>Wi&s;dom cries out, and he that runs may read.</L>
<L>On learned alms were playwrights ever fed,</L>
<L>And &s;craps of poetry their daily bread.</L>
<L>Ev'n Shake&s;peare would unthread the novel's maze,</L>
<L>Or build on penny hi&s;tories his plays.</L>
<L>From paltry ballads Rowe extracted Shore,</L>
<L>Which lay like metal buried in the ore.</L>
<L>To jump at once to bards of later days,</L>
<L>What are the riff-raff of our modern plays?</L>
<L><PB REF="85">
Their native dulne&s;s all in books intrench;</L>
<L>Mere &s;cavengers of Latin, Greek, and French,</L>
<L>Sweep up the learned rubbi&s;h, dirt, and du&s;t,</L>
<L>Or from old iron try to file the ru&s;t.</L>
<L>Give me the bard who&s;e fiery di&s;po&s;ition</L>
<L>Quickens at once, and learns by intuition;</L>
<L>Lifts up his head to think, and, in a minute,</L>
<L>Ideas make a hurly-burly in it;</L>
<L>Struggling for pa&s;&s;age, there ferment and bubble,</L>
<L>And thence run over without further trouble;</L>

<L>Minerva i&s;&s;ued from her father's brain!</L>
<L>Be all original&mdash;&s;truck out at once;</L>
<L>Who borrows, toils, or labours, is a dunce:</L>
<L>Genius, alas! is at the lowe&s;t ebb;</L>

<L>What wonder, if with &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s they &s;trive</L>
<L>With wax and honey to enrich the hive,</L>
<L>If all within their compa&s;s they devour,</L>
<L>And, like the bee, &s;teal &s;weets from ev'ry flower?</L>

<L>What is invention? 'Tis not thoughts innate;</L>
<L>Each head at fir&s;t is but an empty pate.</L>
<L>'Tis but retailing from a wea$thy hoard</L>
<L>The thoughts which ob&s;ervation long has &s;tor'd,</L>
<L>Combining images with lucky hit,</L>
<L>Which &s;en&s;e and education fir&s;t admit;</L>
<L><PB REF="86">
Who, borrowing little from the common &s;tore,</L>
<L>Mends what he takes, and from his own adds more,</L>
<L>He is original; or in&s;piration</L>
<L>Never fill'd bard of this, or other nation,</L>
<L>And Shake&s;peare's art is merely imitation.</L>
<L>For 'tis a truth long prov'd beyond all doubt,</L>
<L>Where nothing's in, there's nothing can come out.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Modes oft may change, and old give way to new,</L>
<L>Or vary betwixt London and Peru;</L>
<L>Yet here, and every where, the general frame</L>
<L>Of nature and of man is &s;till the &s;ame:</L>
<L>Huge ruffs and farthingales are out of fa&s;hion;</L>
<L>But &s;till the human heart's the &s;eat of pa&s;&s;ion:</L>
<L>And he may boa&s;t his genius &s;tands the te&s;t,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Cen&s;ure not all; to prai&s;e let all a&s;pire;</L>
<L>For emulation fans the poet's fire.</L>
<L>Put not one grand extingui&s;her on plays;</L>
<L>But with kind &s;nuffers gently mend their blaze.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While other licenc'd lotteries prevail,</L>
<L>Our bard, by tickli&s;h lottery, tempts a &s;ale,</L>
<L>Prints the particulars of his Mu&s;aeum,</L>
<L>And boldly calls the publick in to &s;ee 'em:</L>
<L>Their calculation mu&s;t his fate reveal,</L>
