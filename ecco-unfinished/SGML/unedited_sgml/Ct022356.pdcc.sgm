<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS Archaeological &s;cience mo&s;t certainly excells Chine&s;e gardening, and as a Pre&s;ident of the Society of Anti|quaries takes precedence (at lea&s;t on Engli&s;h ground) of a Knight of the Polar &s;tar, I flatter my&s;elf, that in point of &s;ub|ject, and choice of the per&s;onage to whom I addre&s;s my&s;elf, I may vie with the inimitable author of the celebrated <HI>Heroic Epi&s;tle</HI>. I &s;hall, however, forbear to enter the li&s;ts with him as a poet, or march in the rear of his numerous ho&s;t of imi|tators: my mode&s;ty prevents the one, and my vanity the other. In&s;tead therefore of writing heroically, I &s;hall write Archaeologically; or, to &s;peak more properly, Heroico-Ar|chaeologically, employing a &s;tyle and manner, of which there is at pre&s;ent only one exemplar in the known world, and of which, I tru&s;t, the following epi&s;tle will be found an ab&s;o|lute <HI>fac&s;imile</HI>. And I am the rather inclined to do this, be|cau&s;e I am credibly informed, that many formidable critics are &s;till attempting to di&s;prove the authenticity of my origi|nal. Now, &s;hould they &s;ucceed in this attempt, the reader ea&s;ily perceives, that I may claim a kind of <HI>fee-&s;imple</HI> right to this &s;tyle by way of direct inheritance: for, &s;hould all the old che&s;ts in all the pari&s;h churches of the kingdom, after a
<PB N="4" REF="3">
pregnancy of four centuries, choo&s;e to bring forth a tuneful progeny of pa&s;torals, tragedies, epic poems, and what not, it cannot be imagined, that the &s;aid che&s;ts will ever pretend, that they were impregnated in the &s;ame wonderful manner, and by the &s;ame occult per&s;onage, with that of St. Mary Red|clift. I mu&s;t, therefore, if her pretty bantlings be proved &s;uppo&s;itious, or illegitimate, nece&s;&s;arily ri&s;e up the fir&s;t Ar|chaeological Poet in Great Britain.</P>
<P>In this eventful moment, therefore, of literary &s;u&s;pence, let not any ra&s;h reader pre&s;ume to &s;ay, that I imitate Rowley; for then another will as peremptorily an&s;wer, that I imitate Chatterton. And if, on the contrary, he a&s;&s;erts that I emu|late Chatterton, the learned per&s;onage, whom I addre&s;s, will be in gratitude bound to prove, that I emulate Rowley; which I own, indeed, I &s;hould like be&s;t, becau&s;e then I &s;hould run a fair chance of excelling Homer, Theocritus, and the be&s;t poets of antiquity. But, be this as it may, I only &s;ay of my&s;elf &s;imply and mode&s;tly, that I write Archaeological|ly; and, as a mo&s;t profound <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Bryant's Ob&s;ervations, p. 29.</NOTE> etymologi&s;t has lately proved that a writer mu&s;t know his own meaning (a comfortable truth to know, in an age, in which &s;o many authors write without any meaning) re&s;ting on his great authority, and taking for granted that I do know my own meaning, I profe&s;s only to write in common plain Engli&s;h fir&s;t, and afterwards to un|&s;pell it, and unanglicize it, by means of that elaborate glo&s;|&s;ary, which Dr. Milles has fabricated for the u&s;e of the read|ers
<PB N="5" REF="4">
of my original. Pity! great pity, indeed, it is, that while he was doing this, he did not al&s;o fabricate another for his imitators. Had he done this, and placed the modern words before the Archaeological ones, it is certain the greate&s;t part of my labour had been &s;aved.</P>
<P>To &s;upply this great de&s;ederatum, it is my intention (after my own fame is by my pre&s;ent production fully e&s;tabli&s;hed) to write a complete Art of Archaeological poetry in the man|ner of Mr. Bys&s;he; and not only this, but to add to it a com|plete Anglo-Gothico-Saxonico-Chattertonic dictionary for the u&s;e of tiros. For this latter work I &s;hall, however, order my book&s;eller to article with Dr. John&s;on, or any other writer in the trade (the Doctor, having been a dictionary-maker, might perhaps be the fitte&s;t) who, for a &s;pecified &s;um, or &s;heet by &s;heet, as they &s;hall agree, may tran&s;po&s;e Dr. Milles's glo&s;&s;ary in the way above-mentioned, &s;o that for any given Engli&s;h word the Gothico-Saxonico-Chattertonic, or any thing but Engli&s;h &s;ynonyme, may be immediately found. When this dictionary is duly formed, I will be bold to &s;ay, that this mode of writing will be found &s;o ea&s;y, that every mi&s;s and ma&s;ter in the kingdom will be enabled to puzzle not only our old Society of Antiquaries here in England, but al&s;o that new Scotch one, which either is, or is about to be founded under the au&s;pices of the Earl of Buchan.</P>
<P>On hinting this &s;cheme to one of my friends, he told me it was not likely that Dr. John&s;on would undertake the ta&s;k, becau&s;e were this &s;tyle to become the fa&s;hion, it would eclip&s;e his own. The objection &s;eemed plau&s;ible at fir&s;t, but, on re|flection,
<PB N="6" REF="5">
I can &s;ee little weight in it. The merit of the Doc|tor's &s;tyle is known to con&s;i&s;t in his long words, hard words, and &s;tiffly-con&s;tructed &s;entences. Now the &s;tyle which I have the honour to recommend, although there are a few long words in it, &s;uch as <HI>amenu&s;ed, cheri&s;aunied</HI>, &amp;c. &amp;c. yet they are not nearly &s;o long, or &s;o numerous, as tho&s;e of the Doctor's own coinage. Hard words too, I own, are to be found in it; but the&s;e only becau&s;e they are ob&s;olete, and not like his, brought in through affectation, but from &s;heer nece&s;&s;ity. Then, as to the con&s;truction of whole &s;entences, nothing in the world is &s;o totally di&s;&s;imilar, as the Lexipha|nic and Archaeologic manner: the one is <HI>&s;wotie, mole</HI>, and <HI>fe|tive</HI>; the other <HI>rugo&s;e, cacophonous</HI>, and <HI>dentifrangent</HI>.</P>
<P>Another rea&s;on, which my friend gave, why the Doctor would probably not undertake this employment, was, that he entertained heterodox notions concerning my Archetype, the immortal Rowley <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His rea&s;on for this heterodoxy is probably this, that Rowley having never had any life at all, there was do probability that any book&s;eller would ever pay him for becoming his biographer.</NOTE>. But what then? Did not the Doctor once entertain heterodox notions concerning the right of the Hanover &s;ucce&s;&s;ion? And if a pen&s;ion from the Trea&s;ury could cure him of the latter, why may not a pen&s;ion from my book&s;eller cure him of the former? My money is as good as a Prime Mini&s;ter's, and as (according to the old proverb) money makes the mare to go, &s;o will it make his &s;pavined pen flounder over any ground, dirty or clean, provided only that it be excu&s;ed from taking that road, which leads to the real intere&s;ts of his Sovereign, or the con&s;titutional liberty of
<PB N="7" REF="6">
his fellow-&s;ubjects. Taking it, therefore, for granted that, if we come up to his price (which, I tru&s;t, the &s;ale of the pre|&s;ent work will enable me to do) the Doctor will engage in the ta&s;k, I &s;hall point out, with much brevity, a few of the many advantages that will accrue to the ri&s;ing generation of poets, if, quitting a mode of ver&s;ifying already grown thread|bare, they would adopt this, which both by example and ex|hortation I here recommend to them. In the fir&s;t place let me a&s;&s;ure them, that they will hereby find rimes as plenty as blackberries: for as Archaeology introduces a whole regi|ment of new-old words, and gives one leave either to u&s;e them or not, ju&s;t as we plea&s;e, it is plain that now it will be full as ea&s;y to write in rime as in blank ver&s;e, or even in plain pro&s;e. And, to &s;hew that I do not make a fal&s;e a&s;&s;er|tion, I will produce one in&s;tance out of a thou&s;and from my original, and that from the famous <HI>Songe to Aella</HI>. The poet had in one line written:
<Q>"Bee&s;prengedd all the <HI>mees</HI> wythe gore."</Q>
In a &s;ub&s;equent &s;tanza he writes:
<Q><L>"Orr &s;ee&s;t the hatchedd &s;tede</L>
<L>"Ypraunceyng o'er the <HI>mead</HI>."</L></Q>
Now <HI>mees</HI> being the Archaeological word, and <HI>mead</HI> the mo|dern Engli&s;h one, it is plain he thought him&s;elf at liberty to write modern Engli&s;h, whenever rime required him to do &s;o. Another benefit is, that the poet will be almo&s;t entirely emancipated from the vile &s;hackles of grammar; a point &s;o clear, that the reader has only to ca&s;t his eye on any page in my Exemplar, to find Pri&s;cian's head broken by the poet,
<PB N="8" REF="7">
and healed by his commentator with equal facility. As to or|thography, there is only one rule, and that the mo&s;t &s;imple that can be imagined (which, however, it is not nece&s;&s;ary con&s;tantly to regard) and this is, to put as many letters as you can po&s;&s;ibly croud into a word, and then re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that that word will look truly Archaeological.</P>
<P>But the la&s;t and be&s;t thing I &s;hall mention is that great and un&s;peakable emolument, which the Anglo-Saxon prefix <HI>y</HI> brings to a nece&s;&s;itated ver&s;ifier: as <HI>yprauncing</HI> for <HI>praunc|ing, ymenging</HI> for <HI>menging</HI>, &amp;c. &amp;c. By having this always at his beck, that poet, who cannot write a &s;mooth line in any given number of &s;yllables, de&s;erves, in my opinion, never to write a line at all. For this dear little <HI>y</HI> comes and goes ju&s;t as one plea&s;es, and may truly be called the Archaeological Poet's Toad-Eater. In &s;hort, with a little variation, we may apply that eulogy to it, which Dryden has given to St. Caeci|lia's mu&s;ic: it hath
<Q><L>Enlarg'd the former narrow bounds,</L>
<L>And added length to <HI>any</HI> &s;ounds.</L></Q>
Such, with a great many more, are the advantages, that at|tend this &s;tyle of poetry. It is not, therefore, I think, great|ly to be wondered at, that either a prie&s;t of the fifteenth century, or that a boy at fifteen years of age (take which you plea&s;e) &s;hould write with greater facility at lea&s;t, if not greater &s;pirit, than tho&s;e mi&s;erable vernacular poets, who are &s;o poor, comparatively, in point of rime, that they have not one to throw at a dog; who are tied &s;o tight to the whip|ping-po&s;t
<PB N="9" REF="8">
of grammar, and fixed &s;o fa&s;t in the &s;tocks of or|thography, that they have hardly an idea at liberty; and, which is wor&s;t of all, cannot eke out a halting line by any other method, than a totally different expre&s;&s;ion. Oh! if you reflect coolly on the&s;e things, my dear brethren of the quill, I am fully per&s;uaded that all of you, like me, will turn Archaeologi&s;ts.</P>
<P>Having thus cur&s;orily &s;hewn what great benefits this &s;tyle confers upon writers, I might now proceed to prove what &s;u|perior delectation it affords to readers. But here I am fore|&s;talled by the learned Dean, who, in his preliminary and all his other ma&s;terly di&s;&s;ertations on the works of my prede|ce&s;&s;or, has irrefragably proved the point. Indeed, as pre&s;i|dent of the Society of Antiquaries, and editor of their va|luable <HI>Archaeologia</HI>, he has, I think, an ab&s;olute pre&s;criptive right to di&s;&s;ert on this &s;ubject. I am not therefore without my hopes, that he will one day comment on the following epi&s;tle, which, if it want any thing, I am bold to &s;ay, wants only the illu&s;trative notes of &s;o &s;agacious an editor.</P>
<P>P. S. I have lately conceived that, as Dryden, Pope, &amp;c. employed their great talents in tran&s;lating Virgil, Homer, &amp;c. that it would be a very commendable employment for the poets of the pre&s;ent age to treat &s;ome of the better &s;ort of their predece&s;&s;ors, &s;uch as Shak&s;peare and Milton, in a &s;imi|lar manner, by putting them into Archaeological language. This, however, I would not call <HI>tran&s;lation</HI>, but <HI>tran&s;muta|tion</HI>, for a very obvious rea&s;on. It is, I believe, a &s;ettled
<PB N="10" REF="9">
point among the critics, with Dr. John&s;on at their head, that the greate&s;t fault of Milton (exclu&s;ive of his political tenets) is, that he writ in blank ver&s;e. See then and admire how ea&s;ily this might be remedied.
<Q><BIBL>PARADISE LOST, Book I.</BIBL>

<L>Bothe morthe and tene to all po&s;teritie.</L></Q>
How very near al&s;o (in point of dramatic excellence) would Shak&s;peare come to the author of <HI>Aella</HI>, if &s;ome of his be&s;t pieces were thus tran&s;muted! As for in&s;tance the &s;oliloquy of Hamlet, "<HI>To be, or not to be</HI>."
