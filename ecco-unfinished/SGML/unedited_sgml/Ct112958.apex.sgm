<HEAD>The ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>Introduction. Recommendation of mercifulne&s;s to animals. Of the winding of wool. Diver&s;ity of wool in the fleece: &s;kill in the a&s;&s;orting of it; particularly among the Dutch. The u&s;es of each &s;ort. Severe winters pernicious to the fleece. Directions to prevent their effects. Wool lighte&s;t in common-fields: inconvenien|cies of common fields. Vulgar errors concerning the wool of Eng|land: its real excellencies; and directions in the choice. No good wool in cold or wet pa&s;tures: yet all pa&s;tures improveable; exempli|fied in the drainage of Bedford level. Britain in antient times not e&s;teemed for wool. Countries e&s;teemed for wool before the Argonautic expedition. Of that expedition, and its con&s;equences. Countries af|terwards e&s;teemed for wool. The decay of arts and &s;ciences in the barbarous ages: the revival, fir&s;t at Venice. Countries noted for wool in the pre&s;ent times. Wool the be&s;t of all the various materials for clothing. The wool of our i&s;land, peculiarly excellent, is the combing wool. Methods to prevent its exportation. Apology of the author for treating this &s;ubject. Bi&s;hop Blai&s;e, the inventor of wool|combing. Of the dying of wool. Few dyes the natural product of England. Nece&s;&s;ity of trade for importing them. The advantages of trade, and its utility in the moral world; exemplified in the pro|&s;perity and ruin of the elder Tyre.</P>

<P>Introduction. Recommendation of labor. The &s;everal methods of &s;pinning. De&s;cription of the loom, and of weaving. Variety of looms. The fulling-mill de&s;cribed, and the progre&s;s of the manufacture. Dying of cloth, and the excellence of the French in that art. Frequent negligence of our artificers. The ill con&s;equences of idlene&s;s. County|workhou&s;es propo&s;ed; with a de&s;cription of one. Good effects of in|du&s;try ex$mplified in the pro&s;pect of Bur&s;tal and Leeds; and the cloth|market there de&s;cribed. Preference of the labors of the loom to other manufactures, illu&s;trated by &s;ome compari&s;ons. Hi&s;tory of the art of weaving: its removal from the Netherlands, and &s;ettlement in &s;e|veral parts in England. Cen&s;ure of tho&s;e, who would reject the per&s;ecut$d and the &s;tranger. Our trade and pro&s;perity owing to them. Of the manufacture of tape&s;try, taught us by the Saracens. Tape|&s;tries of Blenh$im de&s;cribed. Different arts, procuring wealth to different countries. Numerous inhabitants, and their indu&s;try, the &s;ure&s;t &s;ource of it. Hence a wi&s;h, that our country were open to all men. View of the roads and rivers, through which our manufactures are conveyed. Our navigations not far from the &s;eat of our manu|factures: other countries le&s;s happy. The difficult work of Egypt in joining the Nile to the Red Sea; and of France attempting, by ca|nals, a communication between the ocean and the Mediterranean. Such junctions may more ea&s;ily be performed in England, and the Trent and Severn united to the Thames. De&s;cription of the Thames, and port of London.</P>
