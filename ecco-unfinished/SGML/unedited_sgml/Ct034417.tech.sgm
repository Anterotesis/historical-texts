<HEAD>A
CRITICAL DISSERTATION
ON THE
POEMS OF OSSIAN,
THE
SON OF FINGAL.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the monuments remaining of the ancient &s;tate of
nations, few are more valuable than their poems or &s;ongs.
Hi&s;tory, when it treats of remote and dark ages, is &s;eldom
very in&s;tructive. The beginnings of &s;ociety, in every country, are
involved in fabulous confu&s;ion; and though they were not, they
would furni&s;h few events worth recording. But, in every period of
&s;ociety, human manners are a curious &s;pectacle; and the mo&s;t natural
pictures of ancient manners are exhibited in the ancient poems of
nations. The&s;e pre&s;ent to us, what is much more valuable than the
hi&s;tory of &s;uch tran&s;actions as a rude age can afford, The hi&s;tory of
human imagination and pa&s;&s;ion. They make us acquainted with
the notions and feelings of our fellow-creatures in the mo&s;t artle&s;s
ages; di&s;covering what objects they admired, and what plea&s;ures
they pur&s;ued, before tho&s;e refinements of &s;ociety had taken place,
which enlarge indeed, and diver&s;ify the tran&s;actions, but di&s;gui&s;e
the manners of mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="4">
Be&s;ides this merit, which ancient poems have with philo&s;ophical
ob&s;ervers of human nature, they have another with per&s;ons of ta&s;te.
They promi&s;e &s;ome of the highe&s;t beauties of poetical writing. Ir|regular
and unpoli&s;hed we may expect the productions of unculti|vated
ages to be; but abounding, at the &s;ame time, with that en|thu&s;ia&s;m,
that vehemence and fire, which are the &s;oul of poetry.
For many circum&s;tances of tho&s;e times which we call barbarous, are
favourable to the poetical &s;pirit. That &s;tate, in which human nature
&s;hoots wild and free, though unfit for other improvements, certainly
encourages the high exertions of fancy and pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In the infancy of &s;ocieties, men live &s;cattered and di&s;per&s;ed, in the
mid&s;t of &s;olitary rural &s;cenes, where the beauties of nature are their
chief entertainment. They meet with many objects, to them new
and &s;trange; their wonder and &s;urprize are frequently excited; and
by the &s;udden changes of fortune occurring in their un&s;ettled &s;tate
of life, their pa&s;&s;ions are rai&s;ed to the utmo&s;t. Their pa&s;&s;ions have
nothing to re&s;train them: their imagination has nothing to check it.
They di&s;play them&s;elves to one another without di&s;gui&s;e; and con|ver&s;e
and act in the uncovered &s;implicity of nature. As their feelings
are &s;trong, &s;o their language, of it&s;elf, a&s;&s;umes a poetical turn.
Prone to exaggerate, they de&s;cribe every thing in the &s;tronge&s;t co|lours;
which of cour&s;e renders their &s;peech picture&s;que and figura|tive.
Figurative language owes its ri&s;e chiefly to two cau&s;es; to the
want of proper names for objects, and to the influence of imagina|tion
and pa&s;&s;ion over the form of expre&s;&s;ion. Both the&s;e cau&s;es con|curr
in the infancy of &s;ociety. Figures are commonly con&s;idered as
artificial modes of &s;peech, devi&s;ed by orators and poets, after the
world had advanced to a refined &s;tate. The contrary of this is the
truth. Men never have u&s;ed &s;o many figures of &s;tyle, as in tho&s;e
rude ages, when, be&s;ides the power of a warm imagination to &s;ug|ge&s;t
lively images, the want of proper and preci&s;e terms for the ideas
they would expre&s;s, obliged them to have recour&s;e to circumlocu|tion,
metaphor, compari&s;on, and all tho&s;e &s;ub&s;tituted forms of ex|pre&s;&s;ion,
which give a poetical air to language. An American
chief, at this day, harangues at the head of his tribe, in a more
bold metaphorical &s;tyle, than a modern European would adventure
to u&s;e in an Epic poem.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="5">
In the progre&s;s of &s;ociety, the genius and manners of men un|dergo
a change more favourable to accuracy than to &s;prightline&s;s and
&s;ublimity. As the world advances, the under&s;tanding gains ground
upon the imagination; the under&s;tanding is more exerci&s;ed; the
imagination, le&s;s. Fewer objects occur that are new or &s;urprizing.
Men apply them&s;elves to trace the cau&s;es of things; they correct
and refine one another; they &s;ubdue or di&s;gui&s;e their pa&s;&s;ions; they
form their exterior manners upon one uniform &s;tandard of politene&s;s
and civility. Human nature is pruned according to method and
rule. Language advances from &s;terility to copiou&s;ne&s;s, and at the
&s;ame time, from fervour and enthu&s;ia&s;m, to correctne&s;s and preci|&s;ion.
Style becomes more cha&s;te; but le&s;s animated. The progre&s;s
of the world in this re&s;pect re&s;embles the progre&s;s of age in man.
The powers of imagination are mo&s;t vigorous and predominant in
youth; tho&s;e of the under&s;tanding ripen more &s;lowly, and often at|tain
not their maturity, till the imagination begin to flag. Hence,
poetry, which is the child of imagination, is frequently mo&s;t glow|ing
and animated in the fir&s;t ages of &s;ociety. As the ideas of our
youth are remembered with a peculiar plea&s;ure on account of their
liveline&s;s and vivacity; &s;o the mo&s;t ancient poems have often proved
the greate&s;t favourites of nations.</P>
<P>Poetry has been &s;aid to be more ancient than pro&s;e: and how|ever
paradoxical &s;uch an a&s;&s;ertion may &s;eem, yet, in a qualified
&s;en&s;e, it is true. Men certainly never conver&s;ed with one another
in regular numbers; but even their ordinary language would in
ancient times, for the rea&s;ons before a&s;&s;igned, approach to a poeti|cal
&s;tyle; and the fir&s;t compo&s;itions tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity, beyond
doubt, were, in a literal &s;en&s;e, poems; that is, compo&s;itions in
which imagination had the chief hand, formed into &s;ome kind
of numbers, and pronounced with a mu&s;ical modulation or tone.
Mu&s;ick or &s;ong has been found coaeval with &s;ociety among the
mo&s;t barbarous nations. The only &s;ubjects which could prompt
men, in their fir&s;t rude &s;tate, to utter their thoughts in compo&s;i|tions
of any length, were &s;uch as naturally a&s;&s;umed the tone of
poetry; prai&s;es of their gods, or of their ance&s;tors; commemora|tions
of their own warlike exploits; or lamentations over their mi&s;|fortunes.
And before writing was invented, no other compo&s;itions,
except &s;ongs or poems, could take &s;uch hold of the imagination and
<PB N="4" REF="6">
memory, as to be pre&s;erved by oral tradition, and handed down
from one race to another.</P>
<P>Hence we may expect to find poems among the antiquities of all
nations. It is probable too, that an exten&s;ive &s;earch would di&s;cover
a certain degree of re&s;emblance among all the mo&s;t ancient poetical
productions, from whatever country they have proceeded. In a
&s;imilar &s;tate of manners, &s;imilar objects and pa&s;&s;ions operating upon
the imaginations of men, will &s;tamp their productions with the
&s;ame general character. Some diver&s;ity will, no doubt, be occa|&s;ioned
by climate and genius. But mankind never bear &s;uch re|&s;embling
features, as they do in the beginnings of &s;ociety. Its
&s;ub&s;equent revolutions give ri&s;e to the principal di&s;tinctions among
nations; and divert, into channels widely &s;eparated, that current of
human genius and manners, which de&s;cends originally from one
&s;pring. What we have been long accu&s;tomed to call the oriental
vein of poetry, becau&s;e &s;ome of the earlie&s;t poetical productions
have come to us from the Ea&s;t, is probably no more oriental than
occidental; it is characteri&s;tical of an age rather than a country; and
belongs, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to all nations at a certain period. Of
this the works of O&s;&s;ian &s;eem to furni&s;h a remarkable proof.</P>
<P>Our pre&s;ent &s;ubject leads us to inve&s;tigate the ancient poetical
remains, not &s;o much of the ea&s;t, or of the Greeks and Romans,
as of the northern nations; in order to di&s;cover whether the Gothic
poetry has any re&s;emblance to the Celtic or Galic, which we are
about to con&s;ider. Though the Goths, under which name we
u&s;ually comprehend all the Scandinavian tribes, were a people alto|gether
fierce and martial, and noted, to a proverb, for their igno|rance
of the liberal arts, yet they too, from the earlie&s;t times, had
their poets and their &s;ongs. Their poets were di&s;tingui&s;hed by the
title of <HI>Scalders,</HI> and their &s;ongs were termed <HI>Vy&s;es.</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>Olaus Wormius, in the appendix to his Treati&s;e de Literatura Runica, has given a particular account of the Gothic poetry, commonly called, Runic, from <HI>Runes,</HI> which &s;ignifies the Gothic letters. He informs us that there were no &s;ewer than 136 different heads of mea&s;ure or ver&s;e u&s;ed in their <HI>Vy&s;es;</HI> and though we are accu&s;tomed to call rhyme a Gothic invention, he &s;ays expre&s;ly, that among all the&s;e mea&s;ures, rhyme, or corre&s;pon|dence of final &s;yllables, was never em|ployed. He analy&s;es the &s;tructure of one of the&s;e kinds of ver&s;e, that in which the poem of Lodbrog, afterwards quoted, is written; which exhibits a very &s;ingular &s;pecies of harmony, if it can be allowed that name, depending neither upon rhyme nor upon metrical feet, or quantity of &s;yllables, but chiefly upon the number of the &s;yllables, and the di&s;po&s;ition of the let|ters&punc; In every &s;tanza was an equal number of lines: in every line &s;ix &s;yll|bles. In each di&s;tich&punc; it was requi&s;ite that three words &s;hould begin with the &s;ame letter; two of the corre&s;ponding words placed in the fir&s;t line of the di&s;|tich, the third, in the &s;econd line. In each line were al&s;o required two &s;yllables, but never the final ones, formed either of the &s;ame con&s;onants, or &s;ame vowels. As an example of this mea&s;ure, Olaus gives us the&s;e two Latin lines, con&s;tructed exactly according to the above rules of Runic ver&s;e;
<Q><L>Chri&s;tu&s; caput no&s;trum</L>
<L>Coronet te bonis.</L></Q>
The initial letters of Chri&s;tus, Caput and Coronet, make the three corre&s;pond|ing letters of the di&s;tich. In the fir&s;t line, the fir&s;t &s;yllables of Chri&s;tus and of no&s;trum; in the &s;econd line, the <HI>on</HI> in coronet and in bonis make the requi&s;ite corre&s;pondence of &s;yllables. Frequent in|ver&s;ions and tran&s;po&s;itions were permitted in this poetry; which would naturally follow from &s;uch laborious attention to the collocation of words.</P>
<P>The curious on this &s;ubject may con|&s;ult likewi&s;e Dr. Hicks's The&s;aurus Lin|guarum Septentrionalium; particularly the 23d chapter of his Grammatica Anglo Saxonica &amp; Mae&s;o Gothica; where they will find a full account of the &s;truc|ture of the Anglo-Saxon ver&s;e, which nearly re&s;embled the Gothic. They will find al&s;o &s;ome &s;pecimens both of Gothic and Saxon poetry. An extract, which Dr. Hicks has given from the work of one of the Dani&s;h Scalders, entitled, Hervarer Saga, containing an evocation from the dead, may be found in the 6th volume of Mi&s;|cellany Poems, publi&s;hed by Mr. Dry|den.</P></NOTE> Saxo Gram|maticus,
<PB N="5" REF="7">
a Dani&s;h Hi&s;torian of con&s;iderable note, who flouri&s;hed in
the thirteenth century, informs us that very many of the&s;e &s;ongs,
containing the ancient traditionary &s;tories of the country, were found
engraven upon rocks in the old Runic character; &s;everal of which
he has tran&s;lated into Latin, and in&s;erted into his Hi&s;tory. But his
ver&s;ions are plainly &s;o paraphra&s;tical, and forced into &s;uch an imita|tion
of the &s;tyle and the mea&s;ures of the Roman poets, that one
can form no judgment from them of the native &s;pirit of the ori|ginal.
A more curious monument of the true Gothic poetry is
pre&s;erved by Olaus Wormius in his book de Literatura Runica. It
is an Epicedium, or funeral &s;ong, compo&s;ed by Regner Lodbrog;
and tran&s;lated by Olaus, word for word, from the original. This
Lodbrog was a king of Denmark, who lived in the eighth century,
famous for his wars and victories; and at the &s;ame time an emi|nent
<HI>Scalder</HI> or poet. It was his mi&s;fortune to fall at la&s;t into the
hands of one of his enemies, by whom he was thrown into pri&s;on,
and condemned to be de&s;troyed by &s;erpents. In this &s;ituation he
&s;olaced him&s;elf with rehear&s;ing all the exploits of his life. The
poem is divided into twenty-nine &s;tanzas, of ten lines each; and
every &s;tanza begins with the&s;e words, Pugnavimus En&s;ibus, We
have fought with our &s;words. Olaus's ver&s;ion is in many places &s;o
ob&s;cure as to be hardly intelligible. I have &s;ubjoined the whole be|low,
<PB N="6" REF="8">
exactly as he has publi&s;hed it; and &s;hall translate as much as
may give the Engli&s;h reader an idea of the &s;pirit and &s;train of this
kind of poetry.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><LG N="1">

<P>&startq;We have fought with our &s;words.&mdash;I was young, when, to|wards
the ea&s;t, in the bay of Oreon, we made torrents of blood
flow, to gorge the ravenous bea&s;t of prey, and the yellow-footed
bird. There re&s;ounded the hard &s;teel upon the lofty hel|mets
<PB N="7" REF="9">
of men. The whole ocean was one wound. The crow
waded in the blood of the &s;lain. When we had numbered
twenty years, we lifted our &s;pears on high, and every where
&s;pread our renown. Eight barons we overcame in the ea&s;t, be|fore
the port of Diminum; and plentifully we fea&s;ted the eagle
<PB N="8" REF="10">
in that &s;laughter. The warm &s;tream of wounds ran into the
ocean. The army fell before us. When we &s;teered our &s;hip&s;
into the mouth of the Vi&s;tula, we &s;ent the Hel&s;ingians to the
Hall of Odin. Then did the &s;word bite. The waters were all
one wound. The earth was dyed red with the warm &s;tream.
<PB N="9" REF="11">
The &s;word rung upon the coats of mail, and clove the bucklers
in twain. None fled on that day, till among his &s;hips Heraudus
fell. Than him no braver baron cleaves the &s;ea with &s;hips; a
chearful heart did he ever bring to the combat. Then the ho&s;t
threw away their &s;hields, when the uplifted &s;pear flew at the
brea&s;ts of heroes. The &s;word bit the Scarfian rocks; bloody
was the &s;hield in battle, until Rafno the king was &s;lain. From
the heads of warriors the warm &s;weat &s;treamed down their ar|mour.
The crows around the Indirian i&s;lands had an ample
prey. It were difficult to &s;ingle out one among &s;o many deaths.
At the ri&s;ing of the &s;un I beheld the &s;pears piercing the bodies of
foes, and the bows throwing forth their &s;teel-pointed arrows.
Loud roared the &s;words in the plains of Lano.&mdash;The virgin long
bewailed the &s;laughter of that morning.&endq;&mdash;In this &s;train the poet
continues to de&s;cribe &s;everal other military exploits. The images
are not much varied; the noi&s;e of arms, the &s;treaming of blood, and
<PB N="10" REF="12">
the fea&s;ting the birds of prey, often recurring. He mentions the death
of two of his &s;ons in battle; and the lamentation he de&s;cribes as made
for one of them is very &s;ingular. A Grecian or Roman poet would
have introduced the virgins or nymphs of the wood, bewailing the un|timely
fall of a young hero. But, &s;ays our Gothic poet, &startq;when
Rogvaldus was &s;lain, for him mourned all the hawks of heaven,&endq;
as lamenting a benefactor who had &s;o liberally &s;upplied them with
prey; &startq;for boldly,&endq; as he adds, &startq;in the &s;trife of &s;words, did the
breaker of helmets throw the &s;pear of blood.&endq;</P>
<P>The poem concludes with &s;entiments of the highe&s;t bravery and
contempt of death. &startq;What is more certain to the brave man than
death, though amid&s;t the &s;torm of &s;words, he &s;tand always ready
to oppo&s;e it? He only regrets this life who hath never known
di&s;tre&s;s. The timorous man allures the devouring eagle to the
field of battle. The coward, wherever he comes, is u&s;ele&s;s to him|&s;elf.
This I e&s;teem honourable, that the youth should advance to
the combat fairly matched one again&s;t another; nor man retreat
from man. Long was this the warrior's highe&s;t glory. He who
a&s;pires to the love of virgins, ought always to be foremo&s;t in the roar
of arms. It appears to me of truth, that we are led by the Fates.
Seldom can any overcome the appointment of de&s;tiny. Little did
I fore&s;ee that Ella<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">This was the name of his enemy who had condemned him to death.</NOTE> was to have my life in his hands, in that day
when fainting I concealed my blood, and pu&s;hed forth my &s;hips into
the waves; after we had &s;pread a repa&s;t for the bea&s;ts of prey
throughout the Scotti&s;h bays. But this makes me always rejoice
that in the halls of our father Balder [or Odin] I know there are
&s;eats prepared, where, in a &s;hort time, we &s;hall be drinking ale
out of the hollow &s;kulls of our enemies. In the hou&s;e of the
mighty Odin, no brave man laments death. I come not with the
voice of de&s;pair to Odin's hall. How eagerly would all the &s;ons
of A&s;lauga now ru&s;h to war, did they know the di&s;tre&s;s of their
father, whom a multitude of venomous &s;erpents tear! I have given
to my children a mother who hath filled their hearts with valour.
I am fa&s;t approaching to my end. A cruel death awaits me from
the viper's bite. A &s;nake dwells in the mid&s;t of my heart. I
hope that the &s;word of &s;ome of my &s;ons &s;hall yet be &s;tained with
the blood of Ella. The valiant youths will wax red with anger,
and will not &s;it in peace. Fifty and one times have I reared the
<PB N="11" REF="13">
&s;tandard in battle. In my youth I learned to dye the &s;word in
blood: my hope was then, that no king among men would be
more renowned than me. The godde&s;&s;es of death will now
&s;oon call me; I must not mourn my death. Now I end my
&s;ong. The godde&s;&s;es invite me away; they whom Odin has &s;ent
to me from his hall. I will &s;it upon a lofty &s;eat, and drink ale
joyfully with the godde&s;&s;es of death. The hours of my life are
run out. I will &s;mile when I die.&endq;</P>
<P>This is &s;uch poetry as we might expect from a barbarous nation.
It breathes a mo&s;t ferocious &s;pirit. It is wild, har&s;h and irregular;
but at the &s;ame time animated and &s;trong; the &s;tyle, in the original,
full of inver&s;ions, and, as we learn from &s;ome of Olaus's notes,
highly metaphorical and figured.</P>
<P>But when we open the works of O&s;&s;ian, a very different &s;cene
pre&s;ents it&s;elf. There we find the fire and the enthu&s;ia&s;m of the
mo&s;t early times, combined with an amazing degree of regularity
and art. We find tenderne&s;s, and even delicacy of &s;entiment, greatly
predominant over fiercene&s;s and barbarity. Our hearts are melted
with the &s;ofte&s;t feelings, and at the &s;ame time elevated with the
highe&s;t ideas of magnanimity, genero&s;ity, and true heroi&s;m. When
we turn from the poetry of Lodbrog to that of O&s;&s;ian, it is like
pa&s;&s;ing from a &s;avage de&s;art, into a fertile and cultivated country.
How is this to be accounted for? Or by what means to be recon|ciled
with the remote antiquity attributed to the&s;e poems? This is a
curious point; and requires to be illu&s;trated.</P>
<P>That the ancient Scots were of Celtic original, is pa&s;t all doubt.
Their conformity with the Celtic nations in language, manners and
religion, proves it to a full demon&s;tration. The Celtae, a great
and mighty people, altogether di&s;tinct from the Goths and Teu|tones,
once extended their dominion over all the we&s;t of Europe;
but &s;eem to have had their mo&s;t full and compleat e&s;tabli&s;hment in
Gaul. Wherever the Celtae or Gauls are mentioned by ancient wri|ters,
we &s;eldom fail to hear of their Druids and their Bards; the in|&s;titution
of which two orders, was the capital di&s;tinction of their man|ners
and policy. The Druids were their philo&s;ophers and prie&s;ts;
the Bards, their poets and recorders of heroic actions: And both
the&s;e orders of men, &s;eem to have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted among them, as chief
<PB N="12" REF="14">
members of the &s;tate, from time immemorial<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. Strabo. lib. 4.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. Diodor. Sicul. l. 5.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Po&s;idonius ap. Athenaeum, l. 6.</P></NOTE>. We mu&s;t not
therefore imagine the Celtae to have been altogether a gro&s;s and rude
nation. They po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed from very remote ages a formed &s;y&s;tem of
di&s;cipline and manners, which appears to have had a deep and la&s;t|ing
influence. Ammianus Marcellinus gives them this expre&s;s te&s;ti|mony,
that there flouri&s;hed among them the &s;tudy of the mo&s;t laud|able
arts; introduced by the Bards, who&s;e office it was to &s;ing in
heroic ver&s;e, the gallant actions of illu&s;trious men; and by the
Druids, who lived together in colleges or &s;ocieties, after the Pythago|rean
manner, and philo&s;ophizing upon the highe&s;t &s;ubjects, a&s;&s;erted
the immortality of the human &s;oul<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Per haec loca (&s;peaking of Gaul) hominibus paulatim excultis, <HI>viguere &s;tu|dia laudabilium doctrinarum;</HI> inchoata per Bardos &amp; Euhages &amp; Druidas.

Euhages vero &s;crutantes &s;eriem &amp; &s;ublimia naturae pandere conabantur. Inter hos, Druidae ingeniis cel&s;iores, ut auctoritas Pythagorae decrevit, &s;odalitiis ad&s;tricti con&s;ortiis, quae&s;|tionibus altarum occultarumque rerum erecti &s;unt; &amp; despectantes humana pro|nuntiarunt animas immortales. Amm. Marcellinus, l. 15. cap. 9.</NOTE>. Though Julius Cae&s;ar in his
account of Gaul, does not expre&s;ly mention the Bards, yet it is plain
that under the title of Druids, he comprehends that whole college
or order; of which the Bards, who, it is probable, were the di&s;|ciples
of the Druids, undoubtedly made a part. It de&s;erves remark,
that according to his account, the Druidical in&s;titution fir&s;t took ri&s;e
in Britain, and pa&s;&s;ed from thence into Gaul; &s;o that they who a&s;|pired
to be thorough ma&s;ters of that learning were wont to re&s;ort to
Britain. He adds too, that &s;uch as were to be initiated among the
Druids, were obliged to commit to their memory a great number of
ver&s;es, in&s;omuch that &s;ome employed twenty years in this cour&s;e of
education; and that they did not think it lawful to record the&s;e
poems in writing, but &s;acredly handed them down by tradition from
race to race<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vid. Cae&s;ar de bello Gall. lib. 6.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>So &s;trong was the attachment of the Celtic nations to their poetry
and their Bards, that amid&s;t all the changes of their government and
manners, even long after the order of the Druids was extinct,
<PB N="13" REF="15">
and the national religion altered, the Bards continued to flouri&s;h;
not as a &s;et of &s;trolling &s;ong&s;ters, like the Greek <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> or Rhap&s;o|di&s;ts,
in Homer's time, but as an order of men highly re&s;pected in
the &s;tate, and &s;upported by a publick e&s;tabli&s;hment. We find
them, according to the te&s;timonies of Strabo and Diodorus, before
the age of Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar; and we find them remaining under the
&s;ame name, and exerci&s;ing the &s;ame functions as of old, in Ireland,
and in the north of Scotland, almo&s;t down to our own times. It is
well known that in both the&s;e countries, every <HI>Regulus</HI> or chief had
his own Bard, who was con&s;idered as an officer of rank in his court;
and had lands a&s;&s;igned him, which de&s;cended to his family. Of the
honour in which the Bards were held, many in&s;tances occur in
O&s;&s;ian's poems. On all important occa&s;ions, they were the amba&s;&s;a|dors
between contending chiefs; and their per&s;ons were held &s;acred.
&startq;Cairbar feared to &s;tretch his &s;word to the bards, though his &s;oul
was dark.&mdash;Loo&s;e the bards, &s;aid his brother Cathmor, they are
the &s;ons of other times. Their voice &s;hall be heard in other ages,
when the kings of Temora have failed<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P. 188.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>From all this, the Celtic tribes clearly appear to have been ad|dicted
in &s;o high a degree to poetry, and to have made it &s;o much
their &s;tudy from the earlie&s;t times, as may remove our wonder at
meeting with a vein of higher poetical refinement among them, than
was at fir&s;t &s;ight to have been expected among nations, whom we
are accu&s;tomed to call barbarous. Barbarity, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, is a
very equivocal term; it admits of many different forms and degrees;
and though, in all of them, it exclude poli&s;hed manners, it is, how|ever,
not incon&s;i&s;tent with generous &s;entiments and tender affec|tions<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Surely among the wild Laplanders, if any where, barbarity is in its mo&s;t per|fect &s;tate. Yet their love &s;ongs which Scheffer has given us in his Lapponia, are a proof that natural tenderne&s;s of &s;entiment may be found in a country, into which the least glimmering of &s;cience has never pe|netrated. To mo&s;t Engli&s;h readers the&s;e &s;ongs are well known by the clegant tran&s;lations of them in the Spectator, No. 366 and 406. I &s;hall &s;ubjoin Scheffer's Latin ver&s;ion of one of them, which has the appearance of being &s;trictly literal.</P>

<PB N="14" REF="16">
be found to prevail in a rude &s;tate of &s;ociety, no one can &s;ay.
A&s;toni&s;hing in&s;tances of them we know, from hi&s;tory, have &s;ome|times
appeared: and a few characters di&s;tingui&s;hed by tho&s;e high
qualities, might lay a foundation for a &s;et of manners being intro|duced
into the &s;ongs of the Bards, more refined, it is probable, and
exalted, according to the u&s;ual poetical licence, than the real manners
of the country. In particular, with re&s;pect to heroi&s;m; the great
employment of the Celtic bards, was to delineate the characters,
and &s;ing the prai&s;es of heroes. So Lucan;
<Q><L>Vos quoque qui fortes animos, belloque peremptos,</L>

<P>Now when we con&s;ider a college or order of men, who, cultivating
poetry throughout a long &s;eries of ages, had their imaginations con|tinually
employed on the ideas of heroi&s;m; who had all the poems
and panegyricks, which were compo&s;ed by their predece&s;&s;ors, handed
down to them with care; who rivalled and endeavoured to out&s;trip
tho&s;e who had gone before them, each in the celebration of his
particular hero; is it not natural to think, that at length the cha|racter
of a hero would appear in their &s;ongs with the highe&s;t lu&s;tre,
and be adorned with qualities truly noble? Some of the qualities
indeed which di&s;tingui&s;h a Fingal, moderation, humanity, and cle|mency,
would not probably be the fir&s;t ideas of heroi&s;m occurring
to a barbarous people: But no &s;ooner had &s;uch ideas begun to dawn
on the minds of poets, than, as the human mind ea&s;ily opens to the
native repre&s;entations of human perfection, they would be &s;eized and
embraced; they would enter into their panegyricks; they would af|ford
materials for &s;ucceeding bards to work upon, and improve;
<PB N="15" REF="17">
they would contribute not a little to exalt the publick manners.
For &s;uch &s;ongs as the&s;e, familiar to the Celtic warriors from their
childhood, and throughout their whole life, both in war and in
peace, their principal entertainment, mu&s;t have had a very con&s;i|derable
influence in propagating among them real manners nearly
approaching to the poetical; and in forming even &s;uch a hero as
Fingal. E&s;pecially when we con&s;ider that among their limited
objects of ambition, among the few advantages which in a &s;avage
&s;tate, man could obtain over man, the chief was Fame, and that Im|mortality
which they expected to receive from their virtues and ex|ploits,
in the &s;ongs of bards<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">When Edward l. conquered Wales, he put to death all the Welch bards.

po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. He appears clearly to have lived in a period which en|joyed
all the benefit I ju&s;t now mentioned of traditionary poetry.
The exploits of Trathal, Trenmor, and the other ance&s;tors of Fin|gal,
are &s;poken of as familiarly known. Ancient bards are frequently
alluded to. In one remarkable pa&s;&s;age, O&s;&s;ian de&s;cribes him&s;elf as
living in a &s;ort of cla&s;&s;ical age, enlightened by the memorials of for|mer
times, conveyed in the &s;ongs of bards; and points at a period
of darkne&s;s and ignorance which lay beyond the reach of tradition.
&startq;His words,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;came only by halves to our ears; they
were dark as the tales of other times, before the light of the &s;ong
aro&s;e<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 101.</NOTE>.&endq; O&s;&s;ian, him&s;elf, appears to have been endowed by na|ture
with an exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility of heart; prone to that tender me|lancholy
which is &s;o often an attendant on great genius; and &s;u&s;|ceptible
equally of &s;trong and of &s;oft emotions. He was not only a
profe&s;&s;ed bard, educated with care, as we may ea&s;ily believe, to all
the poetical art then known, and connected, as he &s;hews us him&s;elf,
in intimate friend&s;hip with the other contemporary bards, but a war|rior
al&s;o; and the &s;on of the mo&s;t renowned hero and prince of his
age. This formed a conjunction of circum&s;tances, uncommonly fa|vourable
towards exalting the imagination of a poet. He relates ex|peditions
in which he had been engaged; he &s;ings of battles in
<PB N="16" REF="18">
which he had fought and overcome; he had beheld the mo&s;t illu&s;|trious
&s;cenes which that age could exhibit, both of heroi&s;m in war,
and magnificence in peace. For however rude the magnificence
of tho&s;e times may &s;eem to us, we mu&s;t remember that all ideas of
magnificence are comparative; and that the age of Fingal was an
aera of di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;plendor in that part of the world. Fingal
reigned over a con&s;iderable territory; he was enriched with the
&s;poils of the Roman province; he was ennobled by his victories and
great actions; and was in all re&s;pects a per&s;onage of much higher
dignity than any of the chieftains, or heads of Clans, who lived in the
&s;ame country, after a more exten&s;ive monarchy was e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>The manners of O&s;&s;ian's age, &s;o far as we can gather them from
his writings, were abundantly favourable to a poetical genius. The
two di&s;piriting vices, to which Longinus imputes the decline of
poetry, covetou&s;ne&s;s and effeminacy, were as yet unknown. The
cares of men were few. They lived a roving indolent life; hunting
and war their principal employments; and their chief amu&s;ements,
the mu&s;ick of bards and &startq;the fea&s;t of &s;hells.&endq; The great object pur|&s;ued
by heroic &s;pirits, was &startq;to receive their fame,&endq; that is, to become
worthy of being celebrated in the &s;ongs of bards; and &startq;to have
their name on the four gray &s;tones.&endq; To die, unlamented by a
bard, was deemed &s;o great a mi&s;fortune, as even to di&s;turb their
gho&s;ts in another &s;tate. After death, they expected to follow em|ployments
of the &s;ame nature with tho&s;e which had amu&s;ed them on
earth; to fly with their friends on clouds, to pur&s;ue airy deer, and
to li&s;ten to their prai&s;e in the mouths of bards. In &s;uch times as
the&s;e, in a country where poetry had been &s;o long cultivated, and &s;o
highly honoured, is it any wonder that among the race and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
of bards, one Homer &s;hould ari&s;e; a man who, endowed with a na|tural
happy genius, favoured by peculiar advantages of birth and
condition, and meeting in the cour&s;e of his life, with a variety of
incidents proper to fire his imagination, and to touch his heart,
&s;hould attain a degree of eminence in poetry, worthy to draw the
admiration of more refined ages?</P>
<P>The compo&s;itions of O&s;&s;ian are &s;o &s;trongly marked with charac|ters
of antiquity, that although there were no external proof to &s;up|port
that antiquity, hardly any reader of judgment and ta&s;te, could
he&s;itate in referring them to a very remote aera. There are four
great &s;tages through which men &s;ucce&s;&s;ively pa&s;s in the progre&s;s of
<PB N="17" REF="19">
&s;ociety. The fir&s;t and earlie&s;t is the life of hunters; pa&s;turage &s;uc|ceeds
to this, as the ideas of property begin to take root; next, agri|culture;
and la&s;tly, commerce. Throughout O&s;&s;ian's poems, we
plainly find our&s;elves in the fir&s;t of the&s;e periods of &s;ociety; during
which, hunting was the chief employment of men, and the principal
method of their procuring &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Pa&s;turage was not indeed
wholly unknown; for we hear of dividing the herd in the ca&s;e of a
divorce<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P. 31.</NOTE>; but the allu&s;ions to herds and to cattle are not many; and
of agriculture, we find no traces. No cities appear to have been built
in the territories of Fingal. No art is mentioned except that of work|ing
in iron. Every thing pre&s;ents to us the mo&s;t &s;imple and un|improved
manners. At their fea&s;ts, the heroes prepared their own
repa&s;t; they &s;at round the light of the burning oak; the wind lifted
their locks, and whi&s;tled through their open halls. Whatever was
beyond the nece&s;&s;aries of life was known to them only as the &s;poil of
the Roman province; &startq;the gold of the &s;tranger; the lights of the
&s;tranger; the &s;teeds of the &s;tranger, the children of the rein<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The chariot of Cuchullin has been thought by &s;ome to be repre&s;ented as more magnificent than is con&s;i&s;tent with the po|verty of that age; in Book I. of Fingal. But this chariot is plainly only a hor&s;e|litter; and the gems mentioned in the de|&s;cription, are no other than the &s;hining &s;tones or pebbles, known to be frequently found along the we&s;tern coa&s;t of Scotland.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>This repre&s;entation of O&s;&s;ian's times, mu&s;t &s;trike us the more, as
genuine and authentick, when it is compared with a poem of later
date, which Mr. Macpher&s;on has pre&s;erved in one of his notes. It
is that wherein five bards are repre&s;ented as pa&s;&s;ing the evening in the
hou&s;e of a chief, and each of them &s;eparately giving his de&s;cription
of the night<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 253.</NOTE>. The night &s;cenery is beautiful; and the author has
plainly imitated the &s;tyle and manner of O&s;&s;ian: But he has allowed
&s;ome images to appear which betray a later period of &s;ociety. For
we meet with windows clapping, the herds of goats and cows &s;eek|ing
&s;helter, the &s;hepherd wandering, corn on the plain, and the
wakeful hind rebuilding the &s;hocks of corn which had been over|turned
by the tempe&s;t. Whereas in O&s;&s;ian's works, from beginning
to end, all is con&s;i&s;tent; no modern allu&s;ion drops from him; but
every where, the &s;ame face of rude nature appears; a country
wholly uncultivated, thinly inhabited, and recently peopled. The
<PB N="18" REF="20">
gra&s;s of the rock, the flower of the health, the thi&s;tle with its
beard, are the chief ornaments of his land&s;capes. &startq;The de&s;art,&endq;
&s;ays Fingal, &startq;is enough to me, with all its woods and deer.&endq;<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Page 78.</NOTE></P>
<P>The circle of ideas and tran&s;actions, is no wider than &s;uits &s;uch
an age: Nor any greater diver&s;ity introduced into characters, than
the events of that period would naturally di&s;play. Valour and bo|dily
&s;trength are the admired qualities. Contentions ari&s;e, as is
u&s;ual among &s;avage nations, from the &s;lighte&s;t cau&s;es. To be af|fronted
at a tournament, or to be omitted in the invitation to a
fea&s;t, kindles a war. Women are often carried away by force;
and the whole tribe, as in the Homeric times, ri&s;e to avenge the
wrong. The heroes &s;how refinement of &s;entiment indeed on &s;eve|ral
occa&s;ions, but none of manners. They &s;peak of their pa&s;t ac|tions
with freedom, boa&s;t of their exploits, and &s;ing their own
prai&s;e. In their battles, it is evident that drums, trumpets or bag-pipes,
were not known or u&s;ed. They had no expedient for giving
the military alarms but &s;triking a &s;hield, or rai&s;ing a loud cry: And
hence the loud and terrible voice of Fingal is often mentioned, as a
nece&s;&s;ary qualification of a great general; like the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">
of Homer. Of military di&s;cipline or &s;kill, they appear to have been
entirely de&s;titute. Their armies &s;eem not to have been numerous;
their battles were di&s;orderly; and terminated, for the mo&s;t part, by a
per&s;onal combat, or wre&s;tling of the two chiefs; after which, &startq;the
bard &s;ung the &s;ong of peace, and the battle cea&s;ed along the
field<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 140.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>The manner of compo&s;ition bears all the marks of the greate&s;t
antiquity. No artful tran&s;itions; nor full and extended connection
of parts; &s;uch as we find among the poets of later times, when or|der
and regularity of compo&s;ition were more &s;tudied and known;
but a &s;tyle always rapid and vehement; in narration conci&s;e, even
to abruptne&s;s, and leaving &s;everal circum&s;tances to be &s;upplied by
the reader's imagination. The language has all that figurative ca&s;t,
which, as I before &s;hewed, partly a glowing and undi&s;ciplined ima|gination,
partly the &s;terility of language, and the want of proper
terms, have always introduced into the early &s;peech of nations; and
in &s;everal re&s;pects, it carries a remarkable re&s;emblance to the &s;tyle
<PB N="19" REF="21">
of the Old Te&s;tament. It de&s;erves particular notice, as one of the
mo&s;t genuine and deci&s;ive characters of antiquity, that very few ge|neral
terms or ab&s;tract ideas, are to be met with in the whole col|lection
of O&s;&s;ian's works. The ideas of men at fir&s;t, were all par|ticular.
They had not words to expre&s;s general conceptions.
The&s;e were the con&s;equence of more profound reflection, and lon|ger
acquaintance with the arts of thought and of &s;peech. O&s;&s;ian,
accordingly, almo&s;t never expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in the ab&s;tract. His
ideas extended little farther than to the objects he &s;aw around him.
A publick, a community, the univer&s;e, were conceptions beyond
his &s;phere. Even a mountain, a &s;ea, or a lake, which he has oc|ca&s;ion
to mention, though only in a &s;imile, are for the mo&s;t part
particularized; it is the hill of Cromla, the &s;torm of the &s;ea of Mal|mor,
or the reeds of the lake of Lego. A modo of expre&s;&s;ion,
which whil&s;t it is characteri&s;tical of antient ages, is at the &s;ame time
highly favourable to de&s;criptive poetry. For the &s;ame rea&s;ons, per|&s;onification
is a poetical figure not very common with O&s;&s;ian. In|animate
objects, &s;uch as winds, trees, flowers, he &s;ometimes per|&s;onifies
with great beauty. But the per&s;onifications which are &s;o
familiar to later poets of Fame, Time, Terror, Virtue, and the re&s;t of
that cla&s;s, were unknown to our Celtic bard. The&s;e were modes of
conception too ab&s;tract for his age.</P>
<P>All the&s;e are marks &s;o undoubted, and &s;ome of them too, &s;o nice
and delicate, of the mo&s;t early times, as put the high antiquity of
the&s;e poems out of que&s;tion. E&s;pecially when we con&s;ider, that if
there had been any impo&s;ture in this ca&s;e, it mu&s;t have been con|trived
and executed in the Highlands of Scotland, two or three cen|turies
ago; as up to this period, both by manu&s;cripts, and by the
te&s;timony of a multitude of living witne&s;&s;es, concerning the uncon|trovertible
tradition of the&s;e poems, they can clearly be traced.
Now this is a period when that country enjoyed no advantages for a
compo&s;ition of this kind, which it may not be &s;uppo&s;ed to have en|joyed
in as great, if not in a greater degree, a thou&s;and years before.
To &s;uppo&s;e that two or three hundred years ago, when we well
know the Highlands to have been in a &s;tate of gro&s;s ignorance and
barbarity, there &s;hould have ari&s;en in that country a poet, of &s;uch
exqui&s;ite genius, and of &s;uch deep knowledge of mankind, and of
hi&s;tory, as to dive&s;t him&s;elf of the ideas and manners of his own
<PB N="20" REF="22">
age, and to give us a ju&s;t and natural picture of a &s;tate of &s;ociety
ancienter by a thou&s;and years; one who could &s;upport this counter|feited
antiquity through &s;uch a large collection of poems, without
the lea&s;t incon&s;i&s;tency; and who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all this genius and art,
had at the &s;ame time the &s;elf-denial of concealing him&s;elf, and of
a&s;cribing his own works to an antiquated bard, without the impo&s;|ture
being detected; is a &s;uppo&s;ition that tran&s;cends all bounds of
credibility.</P>
<P>There are, be&s;ides, two other circum&s;tances to be attended to,
&s;till of greater weight, if po&s;&s;ible, again&s;t this hypothe&s;is. One is,
the total ab&s;ence of religious ideas from this work; for which the
tran&s;lator has, in his preface, given a very probable account, on the
footing of its being the work of O&s;&s;ian. The Druidical &s;uper&s;ti|tion
was, in the days of O&s;&s;ian, on the point of its final extinction;
and for particular rea&s;ons, odious to the family of Fingal; whil&s;t
the Chri&s;tian faith was not yet e&s;tabli&s;hed. But had it been the
work of one, to whom the ideas of chri&s;tianity were familiar from
his infancy; and who had &s;uperadded to them al&s;o the bigotted &s;u|per&s;tition
of a dark age and country; it is impo&s;&s;ible but in &s;ome pa&s;|&s;age
or other, the traces of them would have appeared. The other
circum&s;tance is, the entire &s;ilence which reigns with re&s;pect to all the
great clans or families, which are now e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Highlands.
The origin of the&s;e &s;everal clans is known to be very ancient: And
it is as well known, that there is no pa&s;&s;ion by which a native High|lander
is more di&s;tingui&s;hed, than by attachment to his clan, and jea|lou&s;y
for its honour. That a Highland bard, in forging a work re|lating
to the antiquities of his country, &s;hould have in&s;erted no cir|cum&s;tance
which pointed out the ri&s;e of his own clan, which a&s;cer|tained
it&s; antiquity, or increa&s;ed its glory, is of all &s;uppo&s;itions that
can be formed, the mo&s;t improbable; and the &s;ilence on this head,
amounts to a demon&s;tration that the author lived before any of the
pre&s;ent great clans were formed or known.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;uming it then, as well may, for certain, that the poems
now under con&s;ideration, are genuine venerable monuments of very
remote antiquity; I proceed to make &s;ome remarks upon their ge|neral
&s;pirit and &s;train. The two great characteri&s;tics of O&s;&s;ian's
poetry are, tenderne&s;s and &s;ublimity. It breathes nothing of the
<PB N="21" REF="23">
gay and chearful kind; an air of &s;olemnity and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s is diffu&s;ed
over the whole. O&s;&s;ian is perhaps the only poet who never re|laxes,
or lets him&s;elf down into the light and amu&s;ing &s;train; which
I readily admit to be no &s;mall di&s;advantage to him, with the bulk of
readers. He moves perpetually in the high region of the grand and
the pathetick. One key note is &s;truck at the beginning, and &s;up|ported
to the end; nor is any ornament introduced, but what is per|fectly
concordant with the general tone or melody. The events re|corded,
are all &s;erious and grave; the &s;cenery throughout, wild and
romantic. The extended heath by the &s;ea &s;hore; the mountain
&s;haded with mi&s;t; the torrent ru&s;hing through a &s;olitary valley; the
&s;cattered oaks, and the tombs of warriors overgrown with mo&s;s; all
produce a &s;olemn attention in the mind, and prepare it for great
and extraordinary events. We find not in O&s;&s;ian, an imagination
that &s;ports it&s;elf, and dre&s;&s;e&s; out gay trifles to plea&s;e the fancy.
His poetry, more perhaps than that of any other writer, de&s;erves to
be &s;tiled, <HI>The Poetry of the Heart.</HI> It is a heart penetrated with
noble &s;entiments, and with &s;ublime and tender pa&s;&s;ions; a heart that
glows, and kindles the fancy; a heart that is full, and pours it&s;elf
forth. O&s;&s;ian did not write, like modern poets, to plea&s;e readers
and critics. He &s;ung from the love of poetry and &s;ong. His de|light
was to think of the heroes among whom he had flouri&s;hed;
to recall the affecting incidents of his life; to dwell upon his pa&s;t
wars and loves and friend&s;hips; till, as he expre&s;&s;es it him&s;elf, &startq;the
light of his &s;oul aro&s;e; the days of other years ro&s;e before him;&endq;
and under this true poetic in&s;piration, giving vent to his genius, no
wonder we &s;hould &s;o often hear, and acknowledge in his &s;trains, the
powerful and ever-plea&s;ing voice of nature.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;Arte, natura potentior omni.&mdash;</L>
<L>E&s;t Deus in nobis, agitante cale&s;cimus illo.</L></Q>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary here to ob&s;erve, that the beauties of O&s;&s;ian's writings
cannot be felt by tho&s;e who have given them only a &s;ingle or a
ha&s;ty peru&s;al. His manner is &s;o different from that of the poets,
to whom we are mo&s;t accu&s;tomed; his &s;tyle is &s;o conci&s;e, and &s;o
much crowded with imagery; the mind is kept at &s;uch a &s;tretch in
accompanying the author; that an ordinary reader is at fir&s;t apt to
be dazzled and fatigued, rather than plea&s;ed. His poems require to
be taken up at intervals, and to be frequently reviewed; and then it
<PB N="22" REF="24">
is impo&s;&s;ible but his beauties mu&s;t open to every reader who is capa|ble
of &s;en&s;ibility. Tho&s;e who have the highe&s;t degree of it, will re|li&s;h
them the mo&s;t.</P>
<P>As Homer is of all the great poets, the one who&s;e manner, and
who&s;e times come the neare&s;t to O&s;&s;ian's, we are naturally led to run
a parallel in &s;ome in&s;tances between the Greek and the Celtic bard.
For though Homer lived more than a thou&s;and years before O&s;&s;ian,
it is not from the age of the world, but from the &s;tate of &s;ociety, that
we are to judge of re&s;embling times. The Greek has in &s;everal
points, a manife&s;t &s;uperiority. He introduces a greater variety of in|cidents;
he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a larger compa&s;s of ideas; has more diver&s;ity
in his characters; and a much deeper knowledge of human nature.
It was not to be expected, that in any of the&s;e particulars, O&s;&s;ian
could equal Homer. For Homer lived in a country where &s;ociety
was much farther advanced; he had beheld many more objects;
cities built and flouri&s;hing; laws instituted; order, di&s;cipline, and
arts begun. His field of ob&s;ervation was much larger and more
&s;plendid; his knowledge, of cour&s;e, more exten&s;ive; his mind
al&s;o, it &s;hall be granted, more penetrating. But if O&s;&s;ian's ideas
and objects be le&s;s diver&s;ified than tho&s;e of Homer, they are all,
however, of the kind fitte&s;t for poetry: The bravery and genero&s;ity
of heroes, the tenderne&s;s of lovers, the attachments of friends, pa|rents,
and children. In a rude age and country, though the events
that happen be few, the undi&s;&s;ipated mind broods over them more;
they &s;trike the imagination, and fire the pa&s;&s;ions in a higher degree;
and of con&s;equence become happier materials to a poetical genius,
than the &s;ame events when &s;cattered through the wide circle of more
varied action, and cultivated life.</P>
<P>Homer is a more chearful and &s;prightly poet than O&s;&s;ian. You
di&s;cern in him all the Greek vivacity; whereas O&s;&s;ian uniformly
maintains the gravity and &s;olemnity of a Celtic hero. This too is in
a great mea&s;ure to be accounted for from the different &s;ituations in
which they lived, partly per&s;onal, and partly national. O&s;&s;ian had
&s;urvived all his friends, and was di&s;po&s;ed to melancholy by the inci|dents
of his life. But be&s;ides this, chearfulne&s;s is one of the many
ble&s;&s;ings which we owe to formed &s;ociety. The &s;olitary wild &s;tate
is always a &s;erious one. Bating the &s;udden and violent bur&s;ts of
<PB N="23" REF="25">
mirth, which &s;ometimes break forth at their dances and fea&s;ts; the
&s;avage American tribes, have been noted by all travellers for their
gravity and taciturnity. Somewhat of this taciturnity may be al&s;o
remarked in O&s;&s;ian. On all occasions he is frugal of his words;
and never gives you more of an image or a de&s;cription, than is ju&s;t
&s;ufficient to place it before you in one clear point of view. It is a
blaze of lightning, which fla&s;hes and vani&s;hes. Homer is more ex|tended
in his de&s;criptions; and fills them up with a greater variety
of circum&s;tances. Both the poets are dramatick; that is, they in|troduce
their per&s;onages frequently &s;peaking before us. But O&s;&s;ian
is conci&s;e and rapid in his &s;peeches, as he is in every other thing.
Homer, with the Greek vivacity, had al&s;o &s;ome portion of the
Greek loquacity. His &s;peeches indeed are highly characteri&s;tical;
and to them we are much indebted for that admirable di&s;play he has
given of human nature. Yet if he be tedious any where, it is in
the&s;e; &s;ome of them trifling; and &s;ome of them plainly un&s;ea&s;on|able.
Both poet&s; are eminently &s;ublime; but a difference may be
remarked in the &s;pecies of their &s;ublimity. Homer's &s;ublimity is
accompanied with more impetuo&s;ity and fire; O&s;&s;ian's with more of
a &s;olemn and awful grandeur. Homer hurries you along; O&s;&s;ian
elevates, and fixes you in a&s;toni&s;hment. Homer is mo&s;t &s;ublime in
actions and battles; O&s;&s;ian, in de&s;cription and &s;entiment. In the
pathetick, Homer, when he chu&s;es to exert it, has gret power;
but O&s;&s;ian exerts that power much oftener, and has the character
of tenderne&s;s far more deeply imprinted on his works. No poet
knew better how to &s;eize and melt the heart. With regard to dig|nity
of &s;entiment, the pre-eminence mu&s;t clearly be given to O&s;&s;ian.
This is indeed a &s;urpri&s;ing circum&s;tance, that in point of humanity,
magnanimity, virtuous feelings of every kind, our rude Celtic bard
&s;hould be di&s;tingui&s;hed to &s;uch a degree, that not only the heroes of
Homer, but even tho&s;e of the polite and refined Virgil, are left far
behind by tho&s;e of O&s;&s;ian.</P>
<P>After the&s;e general ob&s;ervations on the genius and &s;pirit of our au|thor,
I now proceed to a nearer view, and more accurate examina|tion
of his works: And as Fingal is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable poem in
this collection, it is proper to begin with it. To refu&s;e the title of
an epic poem to Fingal, becau&s;e it is not in every little particular,
exactly conformable to the practice of Homer and Virgil, were the
<PB N="24" REF="26">
mere &s;queami&s;hne&s;s and pedantry of critici&s;m. Examined even ac|cording
to Ari&s;totle's rules, it will be found to have all the e&s;&s;ential
requi&s;ites of a true and regular epic; and to have &s;everal of them in
&s;o high a degree, as at fir&s;t view to rai&s;e our a&s;toni&s;hment on finding
O&s;&s;ian's compo&s;ition &s;o agreeable to rules of which he was entirely
ignorant. But our a&s;toni&s;hment will cea&s;e, when we con&s;ider from
what &s;ource Ari&s;totle drew tho&s;e rules. Homer knew no more of
the laws of critici&s;m than O&s;&s;ian. But guided by nature, he com|po&s;ed
in ver&s;e a regular &s;tory, founded on heroic actions, which all
po&s;terity admired. Ari&s;totle, with great &s;agacity and penetration,
traced the cau&s;es of this general admiration. He ob&s;erved what it
was in Homer's compo&s;ition, and in the conduct of his &s;tory, which
gave it &s;uch power to plea&s;e; from this ob&s;ervation he deduced the
rules which poets ought to follow, who would write and plea&s;e like
Homer; and to a compo&s;ition formed according to &s;uch rules, he
gave the name of an epic poem. Hence his whole &s;y&s;tem arose.
Ari&s;totle &s;tudied nature in Homer. Homer and O&s;&s;ian both wrote
from nature. No wonder that among all the three, there &s;hould be
&s;uch agreement and conformity.</P>
<P>The fundamental rules delivered by Ari&s;totle concerning an epic
poem, are the&s;e: That the action which is the ground work of the
poem, &s;hould be one, compleat, and great; that it &s;hould be
feigned, not merely hi&s;torical; that it &s;hould be enlivened with
characters and manners; and heightened by the marvellous.</P>
<P>But before entering on any of the&s;e, it may perhaps be a&s;ked,
what is the moral of Fingal? For, according to M. Bo&s;&s;u, an epic
poem is no other than an allegory contrived to illu&s;trate &s;ome moral
truth. The poet, &s;ays this critic, mu&s;t begin with fixing on &s;ome
maxim, or in&s;truction, which he intends to inculcate on mankind.
He next forms a fable, like one of Ae&s;op's, wholly with a view to
the moral; and having thus &s;ettled and arranged his plan, he then
looks into traditionary hi&s;tory for names and incidents, to give his
fable &s;ome air of probability. Never did a more frigid, pedantic no|tion,
enter into the mind of a critic. We may &s;afely pronounce,
that he who &s;hould compo&s;e an epic poem after this manner, who
&s;hould fir&s;t lay down a moral and contrive a plan, before he had
thought of his per&s;onages and actors, might deliver indeed very
<PB N="25" REF="27">
&s;ound in&s;truction, but would find few readers. There cannot be
the lea&s;t doubt that the fir&s;t object which &s;trikes an epic poet, which
fires his genius, and gives him any idea of his work, is the action or
&s;ubject he is to celebrate. Hardly is there any tale, any &s;ubject a
poet can chu&s;e for &s;uch a work, but will afford &s;ome general moral
in&s;truction. An epic poem is by its nature one of the mo&s;t moral of
all poetical compo&s;itions: But its moral tendecy is by no means to
be limited to &s;ome common-place maxim, which may be gathered
from the &s;tory. It ari&s;es from the admiration of heroic actions,
which &s;uch a compo&s;ition is peculiarly calculated to produce; from
the virtuous emotions which the characters and incidents rai&s;e,
whil&s;t we read it; from the happy impre&s;&s;ion which all the parts
&s;eparately, as well as the whole taken together, leave upon the mind.
However, if a general moral be &s;till in&s;i&s;ted on, Fingal obviou&s;ly
furni&s;hes one, not inferior to that of any other Poet, viz. That
Wi&s;dom and Bravery always triumph over brutal force; or another
nobler &s;till; That the most compleat victory over an enemy is ob|tained
by that moderation and genero&s;ity which convert him into
a friend.</P>
<P>The unity of the Epic action, which, of all Ari&s;totle's rules,
is the chief and mo&s;t material, is &s;o &s;trictly pre&s;erved in Fingal,
that it mu&s;t be perceived by every reader. It is a more compleat
unity than what ari&s;es from relating the actions of one man, which
the Greek critic ju&s;tly cen&s;ures as imperfect; it is the unity of one
enterpri&s;e, the deliverance of Ireland from the inva&s;ion of Swa|ran:
An enterpri&s;e, which has &s;urely the full Heroic dignity. All
the incidents recorded bear a con&s;tant reference to one end; no
double plot is carried on; but the parts unite into a regular
whole: And as the action is one and great, &s;o it is an entire or compleat
action. For we find, as the Critic farther requires, a beginning, a
middle, and an end; a Nodus, or intrigue in the Poem; Difficulties
occurring through Cuchullin's ra&s;hne&s;s and bad &s;ucce&s;s; tho&s;e dif|ficulties
gradually &s;urmounted; and at last the work conducted to
that happy conclu&s;ion which is held e&s;&s;ential to Epic Poetry.
Unity is indeed ob&s;erved with greater exactne&s;s in Fingal, than
in almo&s;t any other Epic compo&s;ition. For not only is unity of
&s;ubject maintained, but that of time and place al&s;o. The Autumn
is clearly pointed out as the &s;ea&s;on of the action; and from begin|ning
<PB N="26" REF="28">
to end the &s;cene is never &s;hifted from the heath of Lena,
along the &s;ea-&s;hore. The duration of the action in Fingal, is much
&s;horter than in the Iliad or Aeneid. But &s;ure, there may be
&s;horter as well as longer Heroic Poems; and if the authority of
Ari&s;totle be al&s;o required for this, he &s;ays expre&s;ly that the Epic
compo&s;ition is indefinite as to the time of its duration. Accordingly
the Action of the Iliad la&s;ts only forty-&s;even days, whil&s;t that of
the Aeneid is continued for more than a year.</P>
<P>Throughout the whole of Fingal, there reigns that grandeur of
&s;entiment, &s;tyle and imagery, which ought ever to di&s;tingui&s;h this
high &s;pecies of poetry. The &s;tory is conducted with no &s;mall art.
The Poet goes not back to a tedious recital of the beginning of the
war with Swaran; but ha&s;tening to the main action, he falls in ex|actly,
by a mo&s;t happy coincidence of thought, with the rule of
Horace.</P>
<Q><L>Semper ad eventum fe&s;tinat, &amp; in medias res,</L>
<L>Non &s;ecus as notas, auditorem rapit&mdash;</L>

<BIBL>De Arte Poet.</BIBL></Q>
<P>He invokes no mu&s;e, for he acknowledged none; but his occa|&s;ional
addre&s;&s;es to Malvina, have a finer effect than the invocation of
any mu&s;e. He &s;ets out with no formal propo&s;ition of his &s;ubject;
but the &s;ubject naturally and ea&s;ily unfolds its &s;elf; the poem
opening in an animated manner, with the &s;ituation of Cuchullin,
and the arrival of a &s;cout who informs him of Swaran's landing.
Mention is pre&s;ently made of Fingal, and of the expected a&s;&s;i&s;tance
from the &s;hips of the lonely i&s;le, in order to give further light to
the &s;ubject. For the poet often &s;hows his addre&s;s in gradually pre|paring
us for the events he is to introduce; and in particular the pre|paration
for the appearance of Fingal, the previous expectations that
are rai&s;ed, and the extreme magnificence fully an&s;wering the&s;e ex|pectations,
with which the hero is at length pre&s;ented to us, are all
worked up with &s;uch &s;killful conduct as would do honour to any
poet of the mo&s;t refined times. Homer's art in magnifying the
character of Achilles has been univer&s;ally admired. O&s;&s;ian cer|tainly
&s;hows no le&s;s art in aggrandizing Fingal. Nothing could be
<PB N="27" REF="29">
more happily imagined for this purpo&s;e than the whole management
of the la&s;t battle, wherein Gaul the &s;on of Morni, had be&s;ought
Fingal to retire, and to leave to him and his other chiefs the honour
of the day. The genero&s;ity of the King in agreeing to this propo|&s;al;
the maje&s;ty with which he retreats to the hill, from whence
he was to behold the engagement, attended by his Bards, and
waving the lightning of his &s;word; his perceiving the chiefs over|powered
by numbers, but loth to deprive them of the glory of
victory by coming in per&s;on to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; his &s;ending Ullin,
the Bard, to animate their courage; and at la&s;t, when the dan|ger
becomes more pre&s;&s;ing, his ri&s;ing in his might, and interpo&s;ing,
like a divinity, to decide the doubtful fate of the day; are all cir|cum&s;tances
contrived with &s;o much art as plainly di&s;cover the Cel|tic
Bards to have been not unpracti&s;ed in Heroic poetry.</P>
<P>The &s;tory which is the foundation of the Iliad is in it&s;elf as &s;imple
as that of Fingal. A quarrel ari&s;es between Achilles and Agamem|non
concerning a female &s;lave; on which, Achilles, apprehending
him&s;elf to be injured, withdraws his a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the re&s;t of the
Greeks. The Greeks fall into great di&s;tre&s;s, and be&s;eech him to be
reconciled to them. He refu&s;es to fight for them in per&s;on, but
&s;ends his friend Patroclus; and upon his being &s;lain, goes forth to
revenge his death, and kills Hector. The &s;ubject of Fingal is this:
Swaran comes to invade Ireland: Cuchullin, the guardian of the
young King, had applied for a&s;&s;i&s;tance to Fingal, who reigned in the
oppo&s;ite coa&s;t of Scotland. But before Fingal's arrival, he is hurried
by ra&s;h coun&s;el to encounter Swaran. He is defeated; he retreats;
and de&s;ponds. Fingal arrives in this conjuncture. The battle is
for &s;ome time dubious; but in the end he conquers Swaran; and the
remembrance of Swaran's being the brother of Agandecca, who had
once &s;aved his life, makes him di&s;mi&s;s him honourably. Homer it is
true has filled up his &s;tory with a much greater variety of particulars
than O&s;&s;ian; and in this has &s;hown a compa&s;s of invention &s;uperior
to that of the other poet. But it mu&s;t not be forgotten, that though
Homer be more circum&s;tantial, his incidents however are le&s;s di|ver&s;ified
in kind than tho&s;e of O&s;&s;ian. War and blood&s;hed reign
throughout the Iliad; and notwith&s;tanding all the fertility of Ho|mer's
invention, there is &s;o much uniformity in his &s;ubjects, that
there are few readers, who, before the clo&s;e, are not tired of perpetual
<PB N="28" REF="30">
fighting. Whereas in O&s;&s;ian, the mind is relieved by a more agree|able
diver&s;ity. There is a finer mixture of war and heroi&s;m, with
love and friend&s;hip, of martial, with tender &s;cenes, than is to be
met with, perhaps, in any other poet. The Epi&s;odes too, have
great propriety; as natural, and proper to that age and country:
con&s;i&s;ting of the &s;ongs of Bards, which are known to have been the
great entertainment of the Celtic heroes in war, as well as in peace.
The&s;e &s;ongs are not introduced at random; if you except the Epi|&s;ode
of Duchommar and Morna, in the fir&s;t book, which, though
beautiful, is more unartful, than any of the re&s;t, they have always
&s;ome particular relation to the actor who is intere&s;ted, or to the
events which are going on; and, whil&s;t they vary the &s;cene, they
pre&s;erve a &s;ufficient connection with the main &s;ubject, by the fitne&s;s
and propriety of their introduction.</P>
<P>As Fingal's love to Agandecca, influences &s;ome circum&s;tances of
the Poem, particularly the honourable di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of Swaran at the
end; it was nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould be let into this part of the
hero's &s;tory. But as it lay without the compa&s;s of the pre&s;ent ac|tion,
it could be regularly introduced no where, except in an Epi|&s;ode.
Accordingly the poet, with as much propriety, as if Ari&s;totle
him&s;elf had directed the plan, has contrived an Epi&s;ode for this pur|po&s;e
in the &s;ong of Carril, at the beginning of the third book.</P>
<P>The conclu&s;ion of the poem is &s;trictly according to rule; and is
every way noble and plea&s;ing. The reconciliation of the contending
heroes, the con&s;olation of Cuchullin, and the general felicity that
crowns the action, &s;ooth the mind in a very agreeable manner, and
form that pa&s;&s;age from agitation and trouble, to perfect quiet and
repo&s;e, which critics require as the proper termination of the Epic
work. &startq;Thus they pa&s;&s;ed the night in &s;ong, and brought back
the morning with joy. Fingal aro&s;e on the heath; and &s;hook
his glittering &s;pear in his hand. He moved fir&s;t towards the
plains of Lena; and we followed like a ridge of fire. Spread
the &s;ail, &s;aid the King of Morven, and catch the winds that
pour from Lena.&mdash;We ro&s;e on the wave with &s;ongs; and ru&s;hed
with joy through the foam of the ocean.&endq;&mdash;So much for the
unity and general conduct of the Epic action in Fingal.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="31">
With regard to that property of the &s;ubject which Ari&s;totle re|quires
that it &s;hould be feigned not hi&s;torical, he must not be un|der&s;tood
&s;o &s;trictly, as if he meant to exclude all &s;ubjects which have
any foundation in truth. For &s;uch exclu&s;ion would both be unrea|&s;onable
in it&s;elf; and what is more, would be contrary to the prac|tice
of Homer, who is known to have founded his Iliad on hi&s;torical
facts concerning the war of Troy, which was famous throughout
all Greece. Ari&s;totle means no more than that it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of
a poet not to be a mere annali&s;t of Facts, but to embelli&s;h truth
with beautiful, probable, and u&s;eful fictions; to copy nature, as
he him&s;elf explains it, like painters, who pre&s;erve a likene&s;s, but
exhibit their objects more grand and beautiful than they are in reality.
That O&s;&s;ian has followed this cour&s;e, and building upon true hi&s;tory,
has &s;ufficiently adorned it with poetical fiction for aggrandizing his
characters and facts, will not, I believe, be que&s;tioned by mo&s;t
readers. At the &s;ame time, the foundation which tho&s;e facts and
characters had in truth, and the &s;hare which the poet him&s;elf had
in the tran&s;actions which he records, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as no
&s;mall advantage to his work. For truth makes an impre&s;&s;ion on the
mind far beyond any fiction; and no man, let his imagination be
ever &s;o &s;trong, relates any events &s;o feelingly as tho&s;e in which he has
been intere&s;ted; paints any &s;cene &s;o naturally as one which he has
&s;een; or draws any characters in &s;uch &s;trong colours as tho&s;e which
he has per&s;onally known. It is con&s;idered as an advantage of the
Epic &s;ubject to be taken from a period &s;o di&s;tant, as by being in|volved
in the darkne&s;s of tradition, may give licence to fable.
Though O&s;&s;ian's &s;ubject may at fir&s;t view appear unfavourable in
this re&s;pect, as being taken from his own times, yet when we reflect
that he lived to an extreme old age; that he relates what had been
tran&s;acted in another country, at the di&s;tance of many years, and
after all that race of men who had been the actors were gone off the
&s;tage; we &s;hall find the objection in a great mea&s;ure obviated. In
&s;o rude an age, when no written records were known, when tra|dition
was loo&s;e, and accuracy of any kind little attended to, what
was great and heroic in one generation, ea&s;ily ripened into the mar|vellou&s;
in the next.</P>
<P>The natural repre&s;entation of human characters in an Epic Poem
is highly e&s;&s;ential to its merit: And in re&s;pect to this there can be
<PB N="30" REF="32">
no doubt of Homer's excelling all the heroic poets who have ever
wrote. But though O&s;&s;ian be much inferior to Homer in this ar|ticle,
he will be found to be equal at lea&s;t, if not &s;uperior, to Virgil;
and has indeed given all the di&s;play of human nature which the
&s;imple occurrences of his times could be expected to furni&s;h. No
dead uniformity of character prevails in Fingal; but on the contrary
the principal characters are not only clearly di&s;tingui&s;hed, but &s;ome|times
artfully contra&s;ted &s;o as to illu&s;trate each other. O&s;&s;ian's he|roes
are like Homer's, all brave; but their bravery, like tho&s;e of
Homer's too, is of different kinds. For in&s;tance; the prudent,
the &s;edate, the mode&s;t and circum&s;pect Connal, is finely oppo&s;ed to
the pre&s;umptuous, ra&s;h, overbearing, but gallant and generous Cal|mar.
Calmar hurries Cuchullin into action by his temerity; and
when he &s;ees the bad effect of his coun&s;els, he will not &s;urvive the
di&s;grace. Connal, like another Uly&s;&s;es, attends Cuchullin to his
retreat, coun&s;els, and comforts him under his mi&s;fortune. The
fierce, the proud, and high &s;pirited Swaran is admirably contra&s;ted
with the calm, the moderate, and generous Fingal. The character
of O&s;car is a favourite one throughout the whole Poems. The
amiable warmth of the young warrior; his eager impetuo&s;ity in the
day of action; his pa&s;&s;ion for fame; his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his father;
his tenderne&s;s for Malvina; are the &s;trokes of a ma&s;terly pencil;
the &s;trokes are few; but it is the hand of nature, and attracts the
heart. O&s;&s;ian's own character, the old man, the hero, and the
bard, all in one, pre&s;ents to us through the whole work a mo&s;t
re&s;pectable and venerable figure, which we always contemplate with
plea&s;ure. Cuchullin is a hero of the highe&s;t cla&s;s; daring, mag|nanimous,
and exqui&s;itely &s;en&s;ible to honour. We become attached
to his intere&s;t, and are deeply touched with his di&s;tre&s;s; and after
the admiration rai&s;ed for him in the fir&s;t part of the Poem, it is a
&s;trong proof of O&s;&s;ian's ma&s;terly genius that he dur&s;t adventure to
produce to us another hero, compared with whom, even the great
Cuchullin, &s;hould be only an inferior per&s;onage; and who &s;hould
ri&s;e as far above him, as Cuchullin ri&s;es above the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Here indeed, in the character and de&s;cription of Fingal, O&s;&s;ian
triumphs almo&s;t unrivalled: For we may boldly defy all antiquity to
&s;hew us any hero equal to Fingal. Homer's Hector po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;eve|ral
great and amiable qualities; but Hector is a &s;econdary per&s;onage
<PB N="31" REF="33">
in the Iliad, not the hero of the work. We &s;ee him only occa|&s;ionally;
we know much le&s;s of him than we do of Fingal; who
not only in the Epic Poem, but throughout the re&s;t of O&s;&s;ian's
works, is pre&s;ented in all that variety of lights, which give the full
di&s;play of a character. And though Hector faithfully di&s;charges his
duty to his country, his friends, and his family, he is tincutured,
however, with a degree of the &s;ame &s;avage ferocity, which prevails
among all the Homeric heroes. For we find him in&s;ulting over the
fallen Patroclus, with the mo&s;t cruel taunts, and telling him, when
he lies in the agony of death, that Achilles cannot help him now;
and that in a &s;hort time his body, &s;tripped naked, and deprived of
funeral honours, &s;hall be devoured by the Vulturs<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Iliad 16. 830. Il. 17. 127.</NOTE>. Whereas in
the character of Fingal, concur almo&s;t all the qualities that can en|noble
human nature; that can either make us admire the hero, or
love the man. He is not only unconquerable in war, but he makes
his people happy by his wi&s;dom in the days of peace<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 62.</NOTE>. He is
truly the father of his people. He is known by the epithet of
&startq;Fingal of the milde&s;t look;&endq; and di&s;tingui&s;hed on every occa&s;ion,
by humanity and genero&s;ity. He is merciful to his foes<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">When he commands his &s;ons, after Swaran is taken pri&s;oner, to &startq;pur&s;ue the re&s;t of Lochlin, over the heath of Lena; that no ve&s;&s;el may hereafter bound on the dark-rolling waves of Ini&s;tore;&endq; he means not a&s;&s;uredly, as &s;ome have mi&s;repre&s;ented him, to order a general &s;laughter of the foes, and to pre|vent their &s;aving them&s;elves by flight; but, like a wi&s;e general, he commands his chiefs to render the victory compleat, by a total rout of the enemy; that they might adventure no more for the future, to fit out any fleet again&s;t him or his al|lies.</NOTE>; full of

tides again&s;t the foes of thy people; but like the gale that moves
the gra&s;s, to tho&s;e who a&s;k thine aid. So Trenmor lived; &s;uch
Trathal was; and &s;uch has Fingal been. My arm was the &s;up|port

&s;teel<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">P. 44.</NOTE>.&endq;&mdash;The&s;e were the maxims of true heroi&s;m, to which he
formed his grand&s;on. His fame is repre&s;ented as every where
<PB N="32" REF="34">
&s;pread; the greate&s;t heroes acknowledge his &s;uperiority; his ene|mies
tremble at his name; and the highe&s;t encomium that can be
be&s;towed on one whom the poet would mo&s;t exalt, is to &s;ay, that his
&s;oul was like the &s;oul of Fingal.</P>
<P>To do ju&s;tice to the poet's merit, in &s;upporting &s;uch a character
as this, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, what is not commonly attended to, that
there is no part of poetical execution more difficult, than to draw a per|fect
character in &s;uch a manner, as to render it di&s;tinct and affecting
to the mind. Some &s;trokes of human imperfection and frailty, are
what u&s;ually give us the mo&s;t clear view, and the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible
impre&s;&s;ion of a character; becau&s;e they pre&s;ent to us a man, &s;uch
as we have &s;een; they recall known features of human nature.
When poets attempt to go beyond this range, and de&s;cribe a fault|le&s;s
hero, they, for the mo&s;t part, &s;et before us, a &s;ort of vague un|di&s;tingui&s;hable
character, &s;uch as the imagination cannot lay hold of,
or realize to it&s;elf, as the object of affection. We know how
much Virgil has failed in this particular. His perfect hero, Aeneas,
is an unanimated, in&s;ipid per&s;onage, whom we may pretend to
admire, but whom no one can heartily love. But what Virgil has failed
in, O&s;&s;ian, to our a&s;toni&s;hment, has &s;ucce&s;&s;fully executed. His
Fingal, though exhibited without any of the common human failings,
is neverthele&s;s a real man; a character which touches and intere&s;ts
every reader. To this it has much contributed, that the poet has
repre&s;ented him as an old man; and by this has gained the advan|tage
of throwing around him a great many circum&s;tances, peculiar
to that age, which paint him to the fancy in a more di&s;tinct light.
He is &s;urrounded with his family; he in&s;tructs his children in the
principles of virtue; he is narrative of his pa&s;t exploits; he is vene|rable
with the grey locks of age; he is frequently di&s;po&s;ed to mo|ralize,
like an old man, on human vanity and the pro&s;pect of
death. There is more art, at lea&s;t more felicity, in this, than may
at fir&s;t be imagined. For youth and old age, are the two &s;tates of
human life, capable of being placed in the mo&s;t picture&s;que lights.
Middle age is more general and vague; and has fewer circum&s;tances
peculiar to the idea of it. And when any object is in a &s;ituation,
that admits it to be rendered particular, and to be cloathed with a
variety of circum&s;tances, it always &s;tands out more clear and full in
poetical de&s;cription.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="35">
Be&s;ides human per&s;onages, divine or &s;upernatural agents are
often introduced into epic poetry; forming what is called the ma|chinery
of it; which mo&s;t critics hold to be an e&s;&s;ential part. The
marvellous, it mu&s;t be admitted, has always a great charm for the
bulk of readers. It gratifies the imagination, and affords room for
&s;triking and &s;ublime de&s;cription. No wonder therefore, that all
poets &s;hould have a &s;trong propen&s;ity towards it. But I mu&s;t ob|&s;erve,
that nothing is more difficult, than to adju&s;t properly the
marvellous with the probable. If a poet &s;acrifice probability, and
fill his work, as Ta&s;&s;o has done, with extravagant &s;upernatural
&s;cenes, he &s;preads over it an appearance of romance and childi&s;h
fiction; he tran&s;ports his readers from this world, into a phanta&s;|tick,
vi&s;ionary region; and lo&s;es that weight and dignity which
&s;hould reign in epic poetry. No work, from which probability is
altogether bani&s;hed, can make a la&s;ting or deep impre&s;&s;ion. Hu|man
actions and manners, are always the mo&s;t intere&s;ting objects
which can be pre&s;ented to a human mind. All machinery, there|fore,
is faulty which withdraws the&s;e too much from view; or ob|&s;cures
them under a cloud of incredible fictions. Be&s;ides being
temperately employed machinery ought always to have &s;ome foun|dation
in popular belief. A poet is by no means at liberty to in|vent
what &s;y&s;tem of the marvellous he plea&s;es: He mu&s;t avail him|&s;elf
either of the religious faith, or the &s;uper&s;titious credulity of the
country wherein he lives; &s;o as to give an air of probability to
events which are mo&s;t contrary to the common cour&s;e of nature.</P>
<P>In the&s;e re&s;pects, O&s;&s;ian appears to me to have been remark$bly
happy. He has indeed followed the &s;ame course with H$mer.
For it is perfectly ab&s;urd to imagine, as &s;ome critics have done,
that Homer's mythology was invented by him, in con&s;equence of
profound reflections on the benefit it would yield to poetry. Homer
was no &s;uch refining genius. He found the traditionary &s;tories on
which he built his Iliad, mingled with popular legends, concern|ing
the intervention of the gods; and he adopted the&s;e, becau&s;e they
amu&s;ed the fancy. O&s;&s;ian, in like manner, found the tales of his
country full of gho&s;ts and &s;pirits: It is likely he believed them him|&s;elf;
and he introduced them, becau&s;e they gave his poems that
&s;olemn and marvellous ca&s;t, which &s;uited his genius. This was
<PB N="34" REF="36">
the only machinery he could employ with propriety; becau&s;e it was
the only intervention of &s;upernatural beings, which agreed with the
common belief of the country. It was happy; becau&s;e it did not
interfere in the lea&s;t, with the proper di&s;play of human characters
and actions; becau&s;e it had le&s;s of the incredible, than mo&s;t other
kinds of poetical machinery; and becau&s;e it &s;erved to diver&s;ify the
&s;cene, and to heighten the &s;ubject by an awful grandeur, which is
the great de&s;ign of machinery.</P>
<P>As O&s;&s;ian's mythology is peculiar to him&s;elf, and makes a con|&s;iderable
figure in his other poems, as well as in Fingal, it may be
proper to make &s;ome ob&s;ervations on it, independent of its &s;ub&s;er|viency
to epic compo&s;ition. It turns for the mo&s;t part on the ap|pearances
of departed &s;pirits. The&s;e, con&s;onantly to the notions of
every rude age, are repre&s;ented not as purely immaterial, but as
thin airy forms, which can be vi&s;ible or invi&s;ible at plea&s;ure; their
voice is feeble; their arm is weak; but they are endowed with
knowledge more than human. In a &s;eparate &s;tate, they retain the
&s;ame di&s;po&s;tions which animated them in this life. They ride on
the wind; they bend their airy bows; and pur&s;ue deer formed of
clouds. The gho&s;ts of departed bards continue to &s;ing. The
gho&s;ts of departed heroes frequent the fields of their former fame.
&startq;They re&s;t together in their caves, and talk of mortal men.
Their &s;ongs are of other worlds. They come &s;ometimes to the
ear of re&s;t, and rai&s;e their feeble voice<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See P. 24, 27, 103, 107, 218, 254.</NOTE>.&endq; All this pre&s;ents to us
much the &s;ame &s;et of ideas, concerning &s;pirits, as we find in the ele|venth
book of the Ody&s;&s;ey, where Uly&s;&s;es vi&s;its the regions of the
dead: And in the twenty-third book of the Iliad, the gho&s;t of
Patroclus, after appearing to Achilles, vani&s;hes preci&s;ely like one
of O&s;&s;ian's emitting a &s;hrill, feeble cry, and melting away like
&s;moke.</P>
<P>But though Homer's and O&s;&s;ian's ideas concerning gho&s;ts were
of the &s;ame nature, we cannot but ob&s;erve, that O&s;&s;ian's gho&s;ts are
drawn with much &s;tronger and livelier colours than tho&s;e of Homer.
O&s;&s;ian de&s;cribes gho&s;ts with all the particularity of one who had
&s;een and conver&s;ed with them, and who&s;e imagination was full of
<PB N="35" REF="37">
the impre&s;&s;ion they had left upon it. He calls up tho&s;e awful and
tremendous ideas which the
<Q>&mdash;Simulacra modis pallentia miris,</Q>
are fitted to rai&s;e in the human mind; and which, in Shake&s;pear's
&s;tyle, &startq;harrow up the &s;oul.&endq; Crugal's gho&s;t, in particular, in the
beginning of the &s;econd book of Fingal, may vie with any ap|pearance
of this kind, de&s;cribed by any epic or tragic poet whatever.
Mo&s;t poets would have contented them&s;elves with telling us, that he
re&s;embled, in every particular, the living Crugal; that his form and
dre&s;s were the &s;ame, only his face more pale and &s;ad; and that he
bore the mark of the wound by which he fell. But O&s;&s;ian &s;ets be|fore
our eyes a &s;pirit from the invi&s;ible world; di&s;tingui&s;hed by all
tho&s;e features, which a &s;trong a&s;toni&s;hed imagination would give
to a gho&s;t. &startq;A dark-red &s;tream of fire comes down from the hill.
Crugal &s;at upon the beam; he that lately fell by the hand of
Swaran, &s;triving in the battle of heroes. His face is like the
beam of the &s;etting moon. His robes are of the clouds of the
hill. His eyes are like two decaying flames. Dark is the wound
of his brea&s;t.&mdash;The &s;tars dim-twinkled through his form;
and his voice was like the &s;ound of a di&s;tant &s;tream.&endq; The cir|cum&s;tance
of the &s;tars being beheld, &startq;dim-twinkling through his
form,&endq; is wonderfully picture&s;que; and conveys the mo&s;t lively
impre&s;&s;ion of his thin and &s;hadowy &s;ub&s;tance. The attitude in
which he is afterwards placed, and the &s;peech put into his mouth,
are full of that &s;olemn and awful &s;ublimity, which &s;uits the &s;ubject.
&startq;Dim, and in tears, he &s;tood and &s;tretched his pale hand over
the hero. Faintly he rai&s;ed his feeble voice, like the gale of the
reedy Lego.&mdash;My gho&s;t, O Connal! is on my native hills; but
my cor&s;e is on the &s;ands of Ullin. Thou &s;halt never talk with
Crugal, or find his lone &s;teps in the heath. I am light as the
bla&s;t of Cromla; and I move like the &s;hadow of mi&s;t. Connal,
&s;on of Colgar! I &s;ee the dark cloud of death. It hovers over the
plains of Lena. The &s;ons of green Erin &s;hall fall. Remove
from the field of gho&s;ts.&mdash;Like the darkened moon he retired, in
the mid&s;t of the whi&s;tling bla&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="38">
Several other appearances of &s;pirits might be pointed out, as
among the mo&s;t &s;ublime pa&s;&s;ages of O&s;&s;ian's poetry. The circum|&s;tances
of them are con&s;iderably diver&s;ified; and the &s;cenery always
&s;uited to the occa&s;ion. &startq;O&s;car &s;lowly a&s;cends the hill. The me|teors
of night &s;et on the heath before him. A di&s;tant torrent
faintly roars. Unfrequent bla&s;ts ru&s;h through aged oaks. The
half-enlightened moon &s;inks dim and red behind her hill. Fee|ble
voices are heard on the heath. O&s;car drew his &s;word.&endq;&mdash;Nothing
can prepare the fancy more happily for the awful &s;cene that
is to follow. &startq;Trenmor came from his hill, at the voice of his
mighty &s;on. A cloud, like the &s;teed of the &s;tranger, &s;upported
his airy limbs. His robe is of the mi&s;t of Lano, that brings
death to the people. His &s;word is a green meteor, half-extin|gui&s;hed.
His face is without form, and dark. He &s;ighed thrice
over the hero: And thrice, the winds of the night roared
around. Many were his words to O&s;car&mdash;He &s;lowly va|ni&s;hed,
like a mi&s;t that melts on the &s;unny hill<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P. 100, 101.</NOTE>.&endq; To ap|pearances
of this kind, we can find no parallel among the Greek
or Roman poets. They bring to mind that noble de&s;cription in the
book of Job: &startq;In thoughts from the vi&s;ions of the night, when
deep &s;leep falleth on men, fear came upon me, and trembling,
which made all my bones to &s;hake. Then a &s;pirit pa&s;&s;ed before
my face. The hair of my fle&s;h &s;tood up. It &s;tood still; but I
could not di&s;cern the form thereof. An image was before mine
eyes. There was &s;ilence; and I heard a voice&mdash;Shall mortal
man be more ju&s;t than God?&endq;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Job iv. 13&mdash;17.</NOTE></P>
<P>As O&s;&s;ian's &s;upernatural beings are de&s;cribed with a &s;urprizing
force of imagination, &s;o they are introduced with propriety. We
have only three gho&s;ts in Fingal: That of Crugal, which comes to
warn the ho&s;t of impending de&s;truction, and to advi&s;e them to &s;ave
them&s;elves by retreat; that of Evirallin, the &s;pou&s;e of O&s;&s;ian, which
calls him to ri&s;e and re&s;cue their &s;on from danger; and that of
Agandecca, which, ju&s;t before the la&s;t engagement with Swaran,
moves Fingal to pity, by mourning for the approaching de&s;truction
of her kin&s;men and people. In the other poems, gho&s;ts &s;ometimes
appear when invoked to foretell futurity; frequently, according to
<PB N="37" REF="39">
the notions of the&s;e times, they come as fore-runners of mi&s;fortune
or death, to tho&s;e whom they vi&s;it; &s;ometimes they inform their
friends at a di&s;tance, of their own death; and &s;ometimes they are
introduced to heighten the &s;cenery on &s;ome great and &s;olemn occa|&s;ion.
&startq;A hundred oaks burn to the wind; and faint light gleams
over the heath. The gho&s;ts of Ardven pa&s;s through the beam;
and &s;hew their dim and di&s;tant forms. Comala is half-un&s;een on
her meteor; and Hidallan is &s;ullen and dim<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P. 97.</NOTE>.&endq;&mdash;&startq;The awful
faces of other times, looked from the clouds of Crona.&endq;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 88.</NOTE>&mdash;&startq;Fercuth!
I &s;aw the gho&s;t of night. Silent he &s;tood on that
bank; his robe of mi&s;t flew on the wind. I could behold his
tears. An aged man he &s;eemed, and full of thought<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 123.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>The gho&s;ts of &s;trangers mingle not with tho&s;e of the natives.
&startq;She is seen; but not like the daughters of the hill. Her robes
are from the &s;trangers land; and &s;he is &s;till alone<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">P. 140.</NOTE>.&endq; When
the gho&s;t of one whom we had formerly known is introduced, the
propriety of the living character is &s;till pre&s;erved. This is remark|able
in the appearance of Calmar's gho&s;t, in the poem entitled
The Death of Cuchullin. He &s;eems to forebode Cuchullin's
death, and to beckon him to his cave. Cuchullin reproaches him
for &s;uppo&s;ing that he could be intimidated by &s;uch progno&s;tics.
&startq;Why do&s;t thou bend thy dark eyes on me, gho&s;t of the car|borne
Calmar! Would'st thou frighten me, O Matha's &s;on!
from the battles of Cormac? Thy hand was not feeble in war;
neither was thy voice for peace. How art thou changed, chief
of Lara! if now thou do&s;t advi&s;e to fly!&mdash;Retire thou to thy
cave: Thou art not Calmar's gho&s;t: He delighted in battle; and
his arm was like the thunder of heaven.&endq; Calmar makes no
return to this &s;eeming reproach: But, &startq;He retired in his bla&s;t
with joy; for he had heard the voice of his prai&s;e<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P. 150.</NOTE>.&endq; This is
preci&s;ely the gho&s;t of Achilles in Homer; who, notwith&s;tanding
all the di&s;&s;ati&s;faction he expre&s;&s;es with his &s;tate in the region of the
dead, as &s;oon as he had heard his &s;on Neoptolemus prai&s;ed for

It is a great advantage of O&s;&s;ian's mythology, that it is not local
and temporary, like that of mo&s;t other ancient poets; which of
cour&s;e is apt to &s;eem ridiculous, after the &s;uper&s;titions have pa&s;&s;ed
away on which it was founded. O&s;&s;ian's mythology is, to &s;peak
&s;o, the mythology of human nature; for it is founded on what
has been the popular belief, in all ages and countries, and under all
forms of religion, concerning the appearances of departed &s;pirits.
Homer's machinery is always lively and amu&s;ing; but far from be|ing
always &s;upported with proper dignity. The indecent &s;quabbles
among his gods, &s;urely do no honour to epic poetry. Whereas
O&s;&s;ian's machinery has dignity upon all occa&s;ions. It is indeed a
dignity of the dark and awful kind; but this is proper; becau&s;e co|incident
with the &s;train and &s;pirit of the poetry. A light and gay
mythology, like Homer'&s;, would have been perfectly un&s;uitable
to the &s;ubjects on which O&s;&s;ian's genius was employed. But though
his machinery be always &s;olemn, it is not, however, always dreary
or di&s;mal; it is enlivened, as much as the &s;ubject would permit, by
tho&s;e plea&s;ant and beautiful appearances, which he &s;ometimes in|troduces,
of the &s;pirits of the hill. The&s;e are gentle &s;pirits; de|&s;cending
on &s;un-beams; fair-moving on the plain; their forms
white and bright; their voices &s;weet; and their vi&s;its to men pro|pitious.
The greate&s;t prai&s;e that can be given, to the beauty of a
living woman, is to &s;ay, &startq;She is fair as the gho&s;t of the hill; when
it moves in a &s;un-beam at noon, over the &s;ilence of Morven<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P. 14.</NOTE>.&endq;

The de&s;cription of Fingal's airy hall, in the poem called
Berrathon, and the a&s;cent of Malvina into it, de&s;erves particular no|tice,
as remarkably noble and magnificent. But above all, the en|gagement
of Fingal with the &s;pirit of Loda, in Carric-thura, can|not
be mentioned without admiration. I forbear tran&s;cribing the
pa&s;&s;age, as it mu&s;t have drawn the attention of every one who has
read the works of O&s;&s;ian. The undaunted courage of Fingal, op|po&s;ed
to all the terrors of the Scandinavian god; the appearance and
the &s;peech of that awful &s;pirit; the wound which he receives, and
the &s;hriek which he &s;ends forth, &startq;as rolled into him&s;elf, he ro&s;e
upon the wind;&endq; are full of the mo&s;t amazing and terrible ma|je&s;ty.
I know no pa&s;&s;age more &s;ublime in the writings of any un|in&s;pired
author. The fiction is calculated to aggrandize the hero;
which it does to a high degree; nor is it &s;o unnatural or wild a fic|tion,
as might at fir&s;t be thought. According to the notions of
tho&s;e times, &s;upernatural beings were material, and con&s;equently,
vulnerable. The &s;pirit of Loda was not acknowledged as a deity
by Fingal; he did not wor&s;hip at the &s;tone of his power; he
plainly con&s;idered him as the God of his enemies only; as a local
Deity, who&s;e dominion extended no farther than to the regions
where he was wor&s;hiped; who had, therefore, no title to threaten
him, and no claim to his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. We know there are poetical pre|cedents
of great authority, for fictions fully as extravagant; and if
Homer be forgiven for making Diomed attack and wound in battle,
the gods whom that chief him&s;elf wor&s;hiped, O&s;&s;ian &s;urely is par|donable
for making his hero &s;uperior to the god of a foreign terri|tory<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The &s;cene of this encounter of Fingal with the &s;pirit of Loda is laid in Ini&s;tore, or the i&s;lands of Orkney; and in the de&s;crip|tion of Fingal's landing there, it is &s;aid, p. $98. &startq;A rock bends along the coa&s;t with all its echoing wood. On the top is the circle of Loda, with the mo&s;&s;y &s;tone of power.&endq; In confirmation of O&s;&s;ian's topography, it is proper to ac|quaint the reader that in the&s;e i&s;lands, as I have been well informed, there are many pillars, and circles of &s;tones, &s;till remaining, known by the name of the &s;tones and circles of Loda, or Loden; to which &s;ome degree of &s;uper&s;titious regard is annexed to this day. The&s;e islands, until the year 1468, made a part of the Dani&s;h dominions. Their ancient lan|guage, of which there are yet &s;ome remains among the natives, is called the Nor&s;e; and is a dialect, not of the Celtic, but of the Scandinavian tongue. The manners and the &s;uper&s;titions of the inhabitants, are quite di&s;tinct from tho&s;e of the Highlands and we&s;tern i&s;les of Scotland. Their an|cient &s;ongs too, are of a different &s;train and character, turning upon magical incan|tations and evocations from the dead, which were the favourite &s;ubjects of the old Runic poetry. They have many tra|ditions among them of wars in former times with the inhabitants of the we&s;tern I&s;lands.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="42">
Notwith&s;tanding the poetical advantages which I have a&s;cribed
to O&s;&s;ian's machinery, I acknowledge it would have been much
more beautiful and perfect, had the author di&s;covered &s;ome know|ledge
of a &s;upream Being. Although his &s;ilence on this head has
been accounted for by the learned and ingenious tran&s;lator in a very
probable manner, yet &s;till it mu&s;t be held a con&s;iderable di&s;advan|tage
to the poetry. For the mo&s;t augu&s;t and lofty ideas that can
embelli&s;h poetry are derived from the belief of a divine admini&s;tration
of the univer&s;e: And hence the invocation of a &s;upream Being, or
at lea&s;t of &s;ome &s;uperior powers who are conceived as pre&s;iding over
human affairs, the &s;olemnities of religious wor&s;hip, prayers pre|ferred,
and a&s;&s;i&s;tance implored on critical occa&s;ions, appear with
great dignity in the works of almo&s;t all poets as chief ornaments of
their compo&s;itions. The ab&s;ence of all &s;uch religious ideas from
O&s;&s;ian's poetry, is a &s;en&s;ible blank in it; the more to be regretted,
as we can ea&s;ily imagine what an illu&s;trious figure they would have
made under the management of &s;uch a genius as his; and how
finely they would have been adapted to many &s;ituations which
occur in his works.</P>
<P>The high merit of Fingal, as an Epic Poem, required a particular
di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. But though the art &s;hown in conducting a work of
&s;uch length di&s;tingui&s;hes it above the other poem&s; in this collection,
the&s;e, however, contain particular beauties equal, perhaps &s;uperior,
to any in Fingal. They are hi&s;torical poems, generally of the ele|giac
kind; and plainly di&s;cover them&s;elves to be the work of the
&s;ame author. One con&s;i&s;tent face of manners is every where pre|&s;ented
to us; one &s;pirit of poetry reigns; the ma&s;terly hand of
O&s;&s;ian appears throughout; the &s;ame rapid and animated &s;tyle;
the &s;ame &s;trong colouring of imagination, and the &s;ame glowing
&s;en&s;ibility of heart. Be&s;ides the unity which belongs to the compo|&s;itions
of one man, there is moreover a certain unity of &s;ubject which
<PB N="41" REF="43">
very happily connects all the&s;e poems. They form the poetical hi&s;tory
of the age of Fingal. The &s;ame race of heroes whom we had met
with in the Epic poem, Cuchullin, O&s;car, Connal and Gaul return
again upon the &s;tage; and Fingal him&s;elf is always the principal
figure, pre&s;ented on every occa&s;ion, with equal magnificence, nay
ri&s;ing upon us to the la&s;t. The circum&s;tances of O&s;&s;ian's old age
and blindne&s;s, his &s;urviving all his friends, and his relating their
great exploits to Malvina, the &s;pou&s;e or mi&s;tre&s;s of his beloved &s;on
O&s;car, furni&s;h the fine&s;t poetical &s;ituations that fancy could devi&s;e
for that tender pathetic which reigns in O&s;&s;ian's poetry.</P>
<P>As each of the&s;e poems have their particular merit, there might
be room for examining them &s;eparately, and for &s;howing, in many
in&s;tances, what art there is in the conduct and di&s;po&s;ition of the
incidents, as well as what beauty in the de&s;criptions and &s;entiments.
Carthon is a regular and highly fini&s;hed piece. The main &s;tory is
very properly introduced by Cle&s;&s;ammor's relation of the adventure
of his youth; and this introduction is finely heightened by Fingal's
&s;ong of mourning over Moina; in which O&s;&s;ian, ever fond of
doing honour to his father, has contrived to di&s;tingui&s;h him, for
being an eminent poet, as well as warrior. Fingal's &s;ong upon this
occa&s;ion, when &startq;his thou&s;and Bards leaned forwards from their
&s;eats, to hear the voice of the King,&endq; is inferior to no pa&s;&s;age
in the whole book; and with great judgment put in his mouth,
as the &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, no le&s;s than the &s;ublimity of the &s;train, is peculiarly
&s;uited to the Hero's character. Temora is the opening of an Epic
Poem, which appears to be equal in every re&s;pect to Fingal. The
contra&s;t between the characters of Cathmar and Cairbar, the death
of O&s;car, and the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of the young prince Cormac, are &s;uch
intere&s;ting &s;cenes, as give the greate&s;t rea&s;on to wi&s;h the recovery
of the &s;equel. In Darthula are a&s;&s;embled almo&s;t all the tender
images that can touch the heart of man: Friend&s;hip, love, the
affections of parents, &s;ons, and brothers, the di&s;tre&s;s of
the aged, and the unavailing bravery of the young. The beautiful
addre&s;s to the moon, with which the poem opens, and the tran&s;i|tion
from thence to the &s;ubject, mo&s;t happily prepare the mind for
that train of affecting events that is to follow. The &s;tory is regular,
dramatic, intere&s;ting to the la&s;t. He who can read it without emo|tion
may congratulate him&s;elf, if he plea&s;es, upon being completely
<PB N="42" REF="44">
armed again&s;t &s;ympathetic &s;orrow. As Fingal had no occa&s;ion of
appearing in the action of this poem, O&s;&s;ian makes a very artful
tran&s;ition from his narration, to what was pa&s;&s;ing in the halls of
Selma. The &s;ound heard there on the &s;trings of his harp, the con|cern
which Fingal &s;hows on hearing it, and the invocation of the
gho&s;ts of their fathers, to receive the Heroes falling in a di&s;tant land,
are introduced with great beauty of imagination to increa&s;e the &s;o|lemnity,
and to diver&s;ify the &s;cenery of the poem.</P>
<P>Carric-thura is full of the mo&s;t &s;ublime dignity; and has this ad|vantage
of being more chearful in the &s;ubject, and more happy in
the cata&s;trophe than mo&s;t of the other poems: Though tempered
at the &s;ame time with epi&s;odes in that &s;train of tender melancholy,
which &s;eems to have been the great delight of O&s;&s;ian and the Bards of
his age. Lathmon is peculiarly di&s;tingui&s;hed, by high genero&s;ity of
&s;entiment. This is carried &s;o far, particularly in the refu&s;al of
Gaul, on one &s;ide, to take the advantage of a &s;leeping foe; and of
Lathmon, on the other, to overpower by numbers the two young
warriors, as to recall into one's mind the manners of Chivalry;
&s;ome re&s;emblance to which may perhaps be &s;ugge&s;ted by other
incidents in this collection of Poems. Chivalry, however,
took ri&s;e in an age and country too remote from tho&s;e of
O&s;&s;ian to admit the &s;u&s;picion that the one could have borrowed
any thing from the other. So far as Chivalry had any real
exi&s;tence, the &s;ame military enthu&s;ia&s;m, which gave birth to
it in the feudal times, might, in the days of O&s;&s;ian, that is, in the
infancy of a ri&s;ing &s;tate, through the operation of the &s;ame cau&s;e,
very naturally produce effects of the &s;ame kind on the minds and
manners of men. So far as Chivalry was an ideal &s;y&s;tem exi&s;ting
only in romance, it will not be thought &s;urpri&s;ing, when we reflect
on the account before given of the Celtic Bards, that this ima|ginary
refinement of heroic manners &s;hould be found among them,
as much, at lea&s;t, as among the <HI>Trobadores,</HI> or &s;trolling Proven&ccedil;al
Bards, in the 10th or 11th century; who&s;e &s;ongs, it is &s;aid, fir&s;t
gave ri&s;e to tho&s;e romantic ideas of heroi&s;m, which for &s;o long a
time enchanted Europe<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vid. Huetius de origine fabularum Romanen&s;ium.</NOTE>. O&s;&s;ian's heroes have all the gallantry
<PB N="43" REF="45">
and genero&s;ity of tho&s;e fabulous knights, without their extravagance;
and his love &s;cenes have native tenderne&s;s, without any mixture of
tho&s;e forced and unnatural conceits which abound in the old roman|ces.
The adventures related by our poet which re&s;emble the mo&s;t
tho&s;e of romance, concern women who follow their lovers to
war di&s;gui&s;ed in the armour of men; and the&s;e are &s;o managed as to
produce, in the di&s;covery, &s;everal of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting &s;ituations;
one beautiful in&s;tance of which may be &s;een in Carric-thura, and
another in Calthon and Colmal.</P>
<P>Oithona pre&s;ents a &s;ituation of a different nature. In the ab&s;ence
of her lover Gaul, &s;he had been carried off and ravi&s;hed by Dun|rommath.
Gaul di&s;covers the place where &s;he is concealed, and
comes to revenge her. The meeting of the two lovers, the &s;entiments
and the behaviour of Oithona on that occa&s;ion, are de&s;cribed with
&s;uch tender and exqui&s;ite propriety, as does the greate&s;t honour
both to the art and to the delicacy of our author; and would have
been admired in any poet of the mo&s;t refined age. The conduct of
Croma mu&s;t &s;trike every reader as remarkably judicious and beau|tiful.
We are to be prepared for the death of Malvina, which is
related in the &s;ucceeding Poem. She is therefore introduced in
per&s;on; &startq;&s;he has heard a voice in a dream; &s;he feels the flut|tering
of her &s;oul;&endq; and in a mo&s;t moving lamentation addre&s;&s;ed
to her beloved O&s;car, &s;he &s;ings her own Death Song. Nothing
could be calculated with more art to &s;ooth and comfort her, than
the &s;tory which O&s;&s;ian relates. In the young and brave Fovar|gormo,
another O&s;car is introduced; his prai&s;es are &s;ung; and
the happine&s;s is &s;et before her of tho&s;e who die in their youth,
&startq;when their renown is around them; before the feeble behold
them in the hall, and &s;mile at their trembling hands.&endq;</P>
<P>But no where does O&s;&s;ian's genius appear to greater advantage,
than in the concluding poem of the whole collection, &startq;The la&s;t
&s;ound of the Voice of Cona.&endq;</P>
<Q><L>Qualis olor noto po&s;iturus littore vitam,</L>

The whole train of ideas is admirably &s;uited to the &s;ubject. Every
thing is full of that invi&s;ible world, into which the aged Bard be|lieves
him&s;elf now ready to enter. The airy hall of Fingal pre&s;ents
it&s;elf to his view; &startq;he &s;ees the cloud that &s;hall receive his gho&s;t;
he beholds the mi&s;t that &s;hall form his robe when he appears on
his hill;&endq; and all the natural objects around him &s;eem to carry
the pre&s;ages of death. &startq;The thi&s;tle &s;hakes its beard to the wind.
&startq;The flower hangs its heavy head&mdash;it &s;eems to &s;ay, I am covered
with the drops of heaven; the time of my departure is near,
and the bla&s;t that &s;hall &s;catter my leaves.&endq; Malvina's death is
hinted to him in the mo&s;t delicate manner by the &s;on of Alpin.
His lamentation over her, her apotheo&s;is, or a&s;cent to the habitation
of heroes, and the introduction to the &s;tory which follows from the
mention which O&s;&s;ian &s;uppo&s;es the father of Malvina to make of
him in the hall of Fingal, are all in the highe&s;t &s;pirit of Poetry.
&startq;And do&s;t thou remember O&s;&s;ian, O To&s;car &s;on of Comloch?
The battles of our youth were many; our &s;words went together
to the field.&endq;&mdash;Nothing could be more proper than to end his
&s;ongs with recording an exploit of the father of that Malvina, of
whom his heart was now &s;o full; and who, from fir&s;t to la&s;t, had
been &s;uch a favourite object throughout all his poems.</P>
<P>But as a &s;eparate di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the merit of each of the poems in
this collection would lead us too far, I &s;hall content my&s;elf with
making &s;ome ob&s;ervations on the chief beauties of our author under
the general heads of De&s;cription, Imagery, and Sentiment.</P>
<P>A poet of original genius is always di&s;tingui&s;hed by his talent
for de&s;cription<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the rules of poetical de&s;cription excellently illu&s;trated by lord Kaims, in his Elements of Critici$m, vol. iii. chap. 21. Of narration and de&s;cription.</NOTE>. A &s;econd rate writer di&s;cerns nothing new or pe|culiar
in the object he means to de&s;cribe. His conceptions of it are
vague and loo&s;e; his expre&s;&s;ions feeble; and of cour&s;e the object is
pre&s;ented to us indi&s;tinctly and as through a cloud. But a true
Poet makes us imagine that we &s;ee it before our eyes: he catches
the di&s;tingui&s;hing features; he gives it the colours of life and reality;
he places it in &s;uch a light that a painter could copy after him.
This happy talent is chiefly owing to a lively imagination, which
<PB N="45" REF="47">
fir&s;t receives a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion of the object; and then, by a pro|per
&s;election of capital picture&s;que circum&s;tances employed in de|&s;cribing
it, tran&s;mits that impre&s;&s;ion in its full force to the imagi|nations
of others. That O&s;&s;ian po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es this de&s;criptive power in
a high degree, we have a clear proof from the effect which his
de&s;criptions produce upon the imaginations of tho&s;e who read him
with any degree of attention and ta&s;te. Few poets are more inte|re&s;ting.
We contract an intimate acquaintance with his principal
heroes. The characters, the manners, the face of the country be|come
familiar; we even think we could draw the figure of his
gho&s;ts: In a word, whil&s;t reading him, we are tran&s;ported as into
a new region, and dwell among his objects as if they were all real.</P>
<P>It were ea&s;y to point out &s;everal in&s;tances of exqui&s;ite painting in
the works of our author. Such, for in&s;tance as the &s;cenery with
which Temora opens, and the attitude in which Caribar is there
pre&s;ented to us<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 172, 173.</NOTE>; the de&s;cription of the young prince Cormac, in
the &s;ame book<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P. 185.</NOTE>; and the ruins of Balclutha in Carthon<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 132.</NOTE>. &startq;I
have &s;een the walls of Balclutha, but they were de&s;olate. The
fire had re&s;ounded in the halls; and the voice of the people is
heard no more. The &s;tream of Clutha was removed from its
place by the fall of the walls. The thi&s;tle &s;hook there its lonely
head: The mo&s;s whi&s;tled to the wind. The fox looked out
from the windows; the rank gra&s;s of the wall waved round
his head. De&s;olate is the dwelling of Moina; &s;ilence is in
the hou&s;e of her fathers.&endq; Nothing al&s;o can be more natural
and lively than the manner in which Carthon afterwards de|&s;cribes
how the conflagration of his city affected him when a
child: &startq;Have I not &s;een the fallen Balclutha? And &s;hall I fea&s;t
with Comhal's &s;on? Comhal! who threw his fire in the
mid&s;t of my father's hall! I was young and knew not the cau&s;e
why the virgins wept. The columns of &s;moke plea&s;ed mine
eye, when they ro&s;e above my walls: I often looked back
with gladne&s;s, when my friends fled above the hill. But when
the years of my youth came on, I beheld the mo&s;s of my fallen
walls. My &s;igh aro&s;e with the morning; and my tears de&s;cended
<PB N="46" REF="48">
with night. Shall I not fight, I &s;aid to my &s;oul, again&s;t the
children of my foes? And I will fight, O Bard! I feel the
&s;trength of my &s;oul<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 135.</NOTE>.&endq; In the &s;ame poem, the a&s;&s;embling of
the chiefs round Fingal, who had been warned of &s;ome impending
danger by the appearance of a prodigy, is de&s;cribed with &s;o many
picture&s;que circum&s;tances, that one imagines him&s;elf pre&s;ent in the
a&s;&s;embly. &startq;The king alone beheld the terrible &s;ight, and he
fore&s;aw the death of his people. He came in &s;ilence to his hall,
and took his father's &s;pear; the mail rattled on his brea&s;t. The
heroes ro&s;e around. They looked in &s;ilence on each other,
marking the eyes of Fingal. They &s;aw the battle in his face.&mdash;A
thou&s;and &s;hields are placed at once on their arms; and
they drew a thou&s;and &s;words. The hall of Selma brightened
around. The clang of arms a&s;cends. The grey dogs howl in
their place. No word is among the mighty chiefs. Each
marked the eyes of the King; and half a&s;&s;umed his &s;pear<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 133.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>It has been objected to O&s;&s;ian, that his de&s;criptions of military
actions are imperfect, and much le&s;s diver&s;ified by circum&s;tances
than tho&s;e of Homer. This is in &s;ome mea&s;ure true. The amazing
fertility of Homer's invention is no where &s;o much di&s;played as in
the incidents of his battles, and in the little hi&s;tory pieces he gives
of the per&s;ons &s;lain. Nor indeed, with regard to the talent of de|&s;cription,
can too much be &s;aid in prai&s;e of Homer. Every thing is
alive in his writings. The colours with which he paints are tho&s;e
of nature. But O&s;&s;ian's genius was of a different kind from Homer's.
It led him to hurry towards grand objects rather than to amu&s;e him|&s;elf
with particulars of le&s;s importance. He could dwell on the
death of a favorite hero; but that of a private man &s;eldom &s;topped
his rapid cour&s;e. Homer's genius was more comprehen&s;ive than
O&s;&s;ian's. It included a wider circle of objects; and could work up
any incident into de&s;cription. O&s;&s;ian's was more limited; but
the region within which it chiefly exerted it&s;elf was the highe&s;t
of all, the region of the pathetic and &s;ublime.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t not imagine, however, that O&s;&s;ian's battles con&s;i&s;t
only of general indi&s;tinct de&s;cription. Such beautiful incidents are
<PB N="47" REF="49">
&s;ometimes introduced, and the circum&s;tances of the per&s;ons &s;lain
&s;o much diver&s;ified, as &s;how that he could have embelli&s;hed his
military &s;cenes with an abundant variety of particulars, if his genius
had led him to dwell upon them. One man &startq;is &s;tretched in the
du&s;t of his native land; he fell, where often he had &s;pread the
fea&s;t, and often rai&s;ed the voice of the harp<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 28.</NOTE>.&endq; The maid of
Ini&s;tore is introduced, in a moving apo&s;trophe, as weeping for
another<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P 14.</NOTE>; and a third, &startq;as rolled in the du&s;t he lifted his
faint eyes to the king,&endq; is remembered and mourned by Fingal
as the friend of Agandecca<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P. 59.</NOTE>. The blood pouring from the wound
of one who is &s;lain by night, is heard &startq;hi&s;&s;ing on the half extingui&s;hed
oak,&endq; which had been kindled for giving light: Another, climbing
a tree to e&s;cape from his foe, is pierced by his &s;pear from behind;
&startq;&s;hrieking, panting he fell; whil&s;t mo&s;s and withered branches
pur&s;ue his fall, and &s;trew the blue arms of Gaul<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">P. 236.</NOTE>.&endq; Never
was a finer picture drawn of the ardour of two youthful warriors
than the following: &startq;I &s;aw Gaul in his armour, and my &s;oul
was mixed with his: For the fire of the battle was in his eyes;
he looked to the foe with joy. We &s;poke the words of friend|&s;hip
in &s;ecret; and the lightening of our &s;words poured together.
We drew them behind the wood, and tried the &s;trength of our
arms on the empty air<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">P. 232.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>O&s;&s;ian is always concise in his descriptions, which adds much
to their beauty and force. For it is a great mistake to imagine, that
a crowd of particulars, or a very full and extended &s;tyle, is of advan|tage
of de&s;cription. On the contrary, &s;uch a diffu&s;e manner for the
mo&s;t part weakens it. Any one redundant circum&s;tance is a nui|&s;ance.
It encumbers and loads the fancy, and renders the main
image indi&s;tinct. &startq;Ob&s;tat,&endq; as Quintilian &s;ays with regard to
&s;tyle, &startq;quicquid non adjuvat.&endq; To be conci&s;e in de&s;cription, is
one thing; and to be general, is another. No de&s;cription that re&s;ts
in generals can po&s;&s;ibly be good; it can convey no lively idea; for
it is of particulars only that we have a di&s;tinct conception. But
at the &s;ame time, no &s;trong imagination dwells long upon any one
particular; or heaps together a ma&s;s of trivial ones. By the happy
choice of &s;ome one, or of a few that are the mo&s;t &s;triking, it pre|&s;ents
<PB N="48" REF="50">
the image more compleat, &s;hows us more at one glance, than
a feeble imagination is able to do, by turning its object round and
round into a variety of lights. Tacitus is of all pro&s;e writers the
mo&s;t conci&s;e. He has even a degree of abruptne&s;s re&s;embling our
author: Yet no writer is more eminent for lively de&s;cription.
When Fingal, after having conquered the haughty Swaran, propo&s;es
to di&s;mi&s;s him with honour: &startq;Rai&s;e to-morrow thy white &s;ails to
the wind, thou brother of Agandecca!&endq;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 77.</NOTE> he conveys, by thus
addre&s;&s;ing his enemy, a &s;tronger impre&s;&s;ion of the emotions then
pa&s;&s;ing within his mind, than if whole paragraphs had been &s;pent
in de&s;cribing the conflict between re&s;entment again&s;t Swaran and
the tender remembrance of his ancient love. No amplification is
needed to give us the mo&s;t full idea of a hardy veteran, after the
few following words: &startq;His &s;hield is marked with the &s;trokes of
battle; his red eye de&s;pi&s;es danger<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 174.</NOTE>.&endq; When O&s;car, left alone,
was &s;urrounded by foes, &startq;he &s;tood,&endq; it is &s;aid, &startq;growing in his
place, like the flood of the narrow vale<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P. 102.</NOTE>;&endq; a happy repre&s;enta|tion
of one, who, by daring intrepidity in the mid&s;t of danger, &s;eems
to increa&s;e in his appearance, and becomes more formidable every
moment, like the &s;udden ri&s;ing of the torrent hemmed in by the
valley. And a whole crowd of ideas, concerning the circum&s;tances
of dome&s;tic &s;orrow occa&s;ioned by a young warrior's fir&s;t going forth
to battle, is poured upon the mind by the&s;e words; &startq;Calmar
leaned on his father's &s;pear; that &s;pear which he brought from
Lara's hall, when the &s;oul of his mother was &s;ad<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">P. 40.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>The conci&s;ene&s;s of O&s;&s;ian's de&s;criptions is the more proper on
account of his &s;ubjects. De&s;criptions of gay and &s;miling &s;cenes
may, without any di&s;advantage, be amplified and prolonged. Force is
not the predominant quality expected in the&s;e. The de&s;cription
may be weakened by being diffu&s;e, yet notwith&s;tanding, may be
beautiful &s;till. Whereas, with re&s;pect to grand, &s;olemn and pa|thetic
&s;ubjects, which are O&s;&s;ian's chief field, the ca&s;e is very dif|ferent.
In the&s;e, energy is above all things required. The ima|gination
mu&s;t be &s;eized at once, or not at all; and is far more
deeply impre&s;&s;ed by one &s;trong and ardent image, than by the an|xious
minutene&s;s of laboured illu&s;tration.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="51">
But O&s;&s;ian's genius, though chiefly turned towards the &s;ublime
and pathetic, was not confined to it: In &s;ubjects al&s;o of grace and
delicacy, he di&s;covers the hand of a ma&s;ter. Take for an example
the following elegant de&s;cription of Agandecca, wherein the ten|derne&s;s
of Tibullus &s;eems united with the maje&s;ty of Virgil.
&startq;The daughter of the &s;now overheard, and left the hall of her
&s;ecret &s;igh. She came in all her beauty; like the moon from
the cloud of the Ea&s;t. Loveline&s;s was around her as light. Her
&s;teps were like the mu&s;ic of &s;ongs. She &s;aw the youth and loved
him. He was the &s;tolen &s;igh of her &s;oul. Her blue eyes rolled
on him in &s;ecret: And &s;he ble&s;t the chief of Morven<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 37.</NOTE>.&endq; Se|veral
other in&s;tances might be produced of the feelings of love
and friend&s;hip painted by our author with a mo&s;t natural and
happy delicacy.</P>
<P>The &s;implicity of O&s;&s;ian's manner adds great beauty to his de|&s;criptions,
and indeed to his whole Poetry. We meet with no af|fected
ornaments; no forced refinement; no marks either in &s;tyle
or thought of a &s;tudied endeavour to &s;hine and &s;parkle. O&s;&s;ian
appears every where to be prompted by his feelings; and to &s;peak
from the abundance of his heart. I remember no more than one
in&s;tance of what can be called quaint thought in this whole col|lection
of his works. It is in the fir&s;t book of Fingal, where from
the tombs of two lovers two lonely yews are mentioned to have
&s;prung, &startq;who&s;e branches wi&s;hed to meet on high<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 18.</NOTE>.&endq; This &s;ym|pathy
of the trees with the lovers, may be reckoned to border on
an Italian conceit; and it is &s;omewhat curious to find this &s;ingle
in&s;tance of that &s;ort of wit in our Celtic poetry.</P>
<P>The &startq;joy of grief,&endq; is one of O&s;&s;ian's peculiar expre&s;&s;ions, &s;e|veral
times repeated. If any one &s;hall think that it needs to be
ju&s;tified by a precedent, he may find it twice u&s;ed by Homer; in
the Iliad, when Achilles is vi&s;ited by the gho&s;t of Patroclus; and in
the Ody&s;&s;ey, when Uly&s;&s;es meets his mother in the &s;hades. On
both the&s;e occa&s;ions, the heroes, melted with tenderne&s;s, lament
their not having it in their power to throw their arms round the

gho&s;t, &startq;that we might,&endq; &s;ay they, &startq;in a mutual embrace, enjoy

<P>But in truth the expre&s;&s;ion &s;tands in need of no defence from
authority; for it is a natural and ju&s;t expre&s;&s;ion; and conveys a
clear idea of that gratification, which a virtuous heart often
feels in the indulgence of a tender melancholy. O&s;&s;ian makes a
very proper di&s;tinction between this gratification, and the de&s;tructive
effect of overpowering grief. &startq;There is a joy in grief, when peace
dwells in the brea&s;ts of the &s;ad. But &s;orrow wa&s;tes the mournful,

grave mu&s;ick; and finely characteri&s;es the ta&s;te of O&s;&s;ian's age and
country. In tho&s;e days, when the &s;ongs of bards were the great de|light
of heroes, the tragic mu&s;e was held in chief honour; gallant
actions, and virtuous &s;ufferings, were the cho&s;en theme; preferably
to that light and trifling &s;train of poetry and mu&s;ick, which pro|motes
light and trifling manners, and &s;erves to ema&s;culate the mind.

<P>Per&s;onal epithets have been much u&s;ed by all the poets of the mo&s;t
ancient ages; and when well cho&s;en, not general and unmeaning,
they contribute not a little to render the &s;tyle de&s;criptive and ani|mated.
Be&s;ides epithets founded on bodily di&s;tinctions, akin to
many of Homer's, we find in O&s;&s;ian &s;everal which are remarkably
beautiful and poetical. Such as, O&s;car of the future fights, Fingal
of the milde&s;t look, Carril of other times, the mildly blu&s;hing Evi|rallin;
Bragela, the lonely &s;un-beam of Dun&s;caich; a Culdee, the
&s;on of the &s;ecret cell.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="53">
But of all the ornaments employed in de&s;criptive poetry, compa|ri&s;ons
or &s;imiles are the mo&s;t &s;plendid. The&s;e chiefly form what is
called the imagery of a poem: And as they abound &s;o much in the
works of O&s;&s;ian, and are commonly among the favourite pa&s;&s;ages
of all poets, it may be expected that I &s;hould be &s;omewhat particu|lar
in my remarks upon them.</P>
<P>A poetical &s;imile always &s;uppo&s;es two objects brought together,
between which there is &s;ome near relation or connection in the
fancy. What that relation ought to be, cannot be preci&s;ely defined.
For various, almo&s;t numberle&s;s, are the analogies formed among ob|jects,
by a &s;prightly imagination. The relation of actual &s;imilitude,
or likene&s;s of appearance, is far from being the only foundation of
poetical compari&s;on. Sometimes a re&s;emblance in the effect pro|duced
by two objects, is made the connecting principle: Sometimes
a re&s;emblance in one di&s;tingui&s;hing property or circum&s;tance. Very
often two objects are brought together in a &s;imile, though they re|&s;emble
one another, &s;trictly &s;peaking, in nothing, only becau&s;e they
rai&s;e in the mind a train of &s;imilar, and what may be called, con|cordant
ideas; &s;o that the remembrance of the one, when recalled,
&s;erves to quicken and heighten the impre&s;&s;ion made by the other.
Thus, to give an in&s;tance from our poet, the plea&s;ure with which
an old man looks back on the exploits of his youth, has certainly no
direct re&s;emblance to the beauty of a fine evening; farther than that
both agree in producing a certain calm, placid joy. Yet O&s;&s;ian has
founded upon this, one of the mo&s;t beautiful compari&s;ons that is to
be met with in any poet. &startq;Wilt thou not li&s;ten, &s;on of the rock,
to the &s;ong of O&s;&s;ian? My &s;oul is full of other times; the joy of
my youth returns. Thus, the &s;un appears in the we&s;t, after the
&s;teps of his brightne&s;s have moved behind a &s;torm. The green
hills lift their dewy heads. The blue &s;treams rejoice in the vale.
The aged hero comes forth on his &s;taff; and his grey hair glitters
in the beam<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P. 220.</NOTE>.&endq; Never was there a finer group of objects. It
rai&s;es a &s;trong conception of the old man's joy and elation of heart,
by di&s;playing a &s;cene, which produces in every &s;pectator, a corre&s;|ponding
train of plea&s;ing emotions; the declining &s;un looking forth
<PB N="52" REF="54">
in his brightne&s;s after a &s;torm; the chearful face of all nature; and
the &s;till life finely animated by the circum&s;tance of the aged hero,
with his &s;taff and his grey locks; a circum&s;tance both extremely pic|ture&s;que
in it&s;elf, and peculiarly &s;uited to the main object of the
compari&s;on. Such analogies and a&s;&s;ociations of ideas as the&s;e, are
highly plea&s;ing to the fancy. They give opportunity for introdu|cing
many a fine poetical picture. They diver&s;ify the &s;cene; they
aggrandize the &s;ubject; they keep the imagination awake and
&s;prightly. For as the judgment is principally exerci&s;ed in di&s;tin|gui&s;hing
objects, and remarking the differences among tho&s;e which
&s;eem like; &s;o the highe&s;t amu&s;ement of the imagination is to trace
likene&s;&s;es and agreements among tho&s;e which &s;eem different.</P>
<P>The principal rules which re&s;pect poetical compari&s;ons are, that
they be introduced on proper occa&s;ions, when the mind is di&s;po&s;ed
to reli&s;h them; and not in the mid&s;t of &s;ome &s;evere and agitating
pa&s;&s;ion, which cannot admit this play of fancy; that they be
founded on a re&s;emblance neither too near and obvious, &s;o as to give
little amu&s;ement to the imagination in tracing it, nor too faint and
remote, &s;o as to be apprehended with difficulty; that they &s;erve ei|ther
to illu&s;trate the principal object, and to render the conception
of it, more clear and di&s;tinct; or at lea&s;t, to heighten and embelli&s;h
it, by a &s;uitable a&s;&s;ociation of images<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Elements of Critici&s;m, ch. 19: vol. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Every country has a &s;cenery peculiar to it&s;elf; and the imagery
of a good poet will exhibit it. For as he copies after nature, his
allu&s;ions will of cour&s;e be taken from tho&s;e objects which he &s;ees
around him, and which have oftene&s;t &s;truck his fancy. For this
rea&s;on, in order to judge of the propriety of poetical imagery, we
ought to be, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, acquainted with the natural hi&s;tory of
the country where the &s;cene of the poem is laid. The introduction
of foreign images betrays a poet, copying not from nature, but from
other writers. Hence &s;o many Lions, and Tygers, and Eagles and
Serpents, which we meet with in the &s;imiles of modern poets; as if
the&s;e animals had acquired &s;ome right to a place in poetical compa|ri&s;ons
for ever, becau&s;e employed by ancient authors. They
employed them with propriety, as objects generally known in their
<PB N="53" REF="55">
country; but they are ab&s;urdly u&s;ed for illu&s;tration by us, who know
them only at &s;econd hand, or by de&s;cription. To mo&s;t readers of
modern poetry, it were more to the purpo&s;e to de&s;cribe Lions or
Tygers by &s;imiles taken from men, than to compare men to Lions.
O&s;&s;ian is very correct in this particular. His imagery is, without
exception, copied from that face of nature, which he &s;aw before his
eyes; and by con&s;equence may be expected to be lively. We meet
with no Grecian or Italian &s;cenery; but with the mi&s;ts, and clouds,
and &s;torms of a northern mountainous region.</P>
<P>No poet abounds more in &s;imiles than O&s;&s;ian. There are in this
collection as many, at lea&s;t, as in the whole Iliad of Homer,
though that be a longer work. I am indeed inclined to think, that
the works of both poets are too much crowded with them. Similes
are &s;parkling ornaments; and like all things that &s;parkle, are apt to
dazzle and tire us by their lu&s;tre. But if O&s;&s;ian's &s;imiles be too
frequent, they have this advantage of being commonly &s;horter than
Homer's; they interrupt his narration le&s;s; he ju&s;t glances a&s;ide to
&s;ome re&s;embling object, and in&s;tantly returns to his former track.
Homer's &s;imiles include a wider range of objects. But in return,
O&s;&s;ian's are, without exception, taken from objects of dignity,
which cannot be &s;aid for all tho&s;e which Homer employs. The
Sun, the Moon, and the Stars, Clouds and Meteors, Lightning and
Thunder, Seas and Whales, Rivers, Torrents, Winds, Rain, Snow,
Dews, Mi&s;t, Fire and Smoke, Trees and Torrents, Heath and Gra&s;s
and Flowers, Rocks and Mountains, Mu&s;ick and Songs, Light and
Darkne&s;s, Spirits and Gho&s;ts; the&s;e form the circle, within which
O&s;&s;ian's compari&s;ons generally run. Some, not many, are taken
from Birds and Bea&s;ts; as Eagles, Sea Fowl, the Hor&s;e, the Deer,
and the Mountain Bee; and a very few from &s;uch operations of art
as were then known. Homer has diver&s;ified his imagery by many
more allu&s;ions to the animal world; to Lions, Bulls, Goats,
Herds of Cattle, Serpents, In&s;ects; and to the various occupations
of rural and pa&s;toral life. O&s;&s;ian's defect in this article, is plainly
owing to the de&s;ert, uncultivated &s;tate of his country, which &s;ug|ge&s;ted
to him few images beyond natural inanimate objects, in their
rude&s;t form. The birds and animals of the country were probably
not numerous; and his acquaintance with them was &s;lender, as they
were little &s;ubjected to the u&s;es of man.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="56">
The great objection made to O&s;&s;ian's imagery, is its uniformity,
and the too frequent repetition of the &s;ame compari&s;ons. In a work
&s;o thick &s;own with &s;imiles, one could not but expect to find images
of the &s;ame kind &s;ometimes &s;ugge&s;ted to the poet by re&s;embling ob|jects;
e&s;pecially to a poet like O&s;&s;ian, who wrote from the imme|diate
impul&s;e of poetical enthu&s;ia&s;m, and without much preparation
of &s;tudy or labour. Fertile as Homer's imagination is acknowledged
to be, who does not know how often his Lions and Bulls and
Flocks of Sheep, recur with little or no variation; nay, &s;ometimes
in the very &s;ame words? The objection made to O&s;&s;ian is, however,
founded, in a great mea&s;ure, upon a mi&s;take. It has been &s;uppo&s;ed
by inattentive readers, that wherever the Moon, the Cloud, or the
Thunder, returns in a &s;imile, it is the &s;ame &s;imile, and the &s;ame
Moon, or Cloud, or Thunder, which they had met with a few
pages before. Whereas very often the &s;imiles are widely different.
The object, whence they are taken, is indeed in &s;ub&s;tance the
&s;ame; but the image is new; for the appearance of the object is
changed; it is pre&s;ented to the fancy in another attitude; and
cloathed with new circum&s;tances, to make it &s;uit the different illu&s;|tration
for which it is employed. In this, lies O&s;&s;ian's great art; in &s;o
happily varying the form of the few natural appearances with which
he was acquainted, as to make them corre&s;pond to a great many dif|ferent
objects.</P>
<P>Let us take for one in&s;tance the Moon, which is very frequently
introduced into his compari&s;ons; as in northern climates, where the
nights are long, the Moon is a greater object of attention, than in the
climate of Homer; and let us view how much our poet has diver&s;i|fied
its appearance. The &s;hield of a warrior is like &startq;the darkened
moon when it moves a dun circle through the heavens<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P. 29.</NOTE>.&endq; The
face of a gho&s;t, wan and pale, is like &startq;the beam of the &s;etting
moon<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 22.</NOTE>.&endq; And a different appearance of a gho&s;t, thin and in|di&s;tinct,
is like &startq;the new moon &s;een through the gathered mi&s;t,
when the &s;ky pours down its flaky &s;now, and the world is &s;ilent
and dark<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 131.</NOTE>;&endq; or in a different form &s;till, it is like the watry beam
of the moon, when it ru&s;hes from between two clouds, and the
<PB N="55" REF="57">
&startq;midnight &s;hower is on the field<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P. 119.</NOTE>.&endq; A very oppo&s;ite u&s;e is made
of the moon in the de&s;cription of Agandecca: &startq;She came in all her
beauty, like the moon from the cloud of the Ea&s;t<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 37.</NOTE>.&endq; Hope,
&s;ucceeded by di&s;appointment, is &startq;joy ri&s;ing on her face, and &s;orrow
returning again, like a thin cloud on the moon<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 119.</NOTE>.&endq; But when
Swaran, after his defeat, is cheared by Fingal's genero&s;ity, &startq;His face
brightened like the full moon of heaven, when the clouds vani&s;h
away, and leave her calm and broad in the mid&s;t of the &s;ky<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P. 79.</NOTE>.&endq;
Venvela is &startq;bright as the moon when it trembles o'er the we&s;tern
wave<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">P. 195.</NOTE>;&endq; but the &s;oul of the guilty Uthal is &startq;dark as the trou|bled
face of the moon, when it foretels the &s;torm<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">P. 264.</NOTE>.&endq; And by a
very fanciful and uncommon allu&s;ion, it is &s;aid of Cormac, who
was to die in his early years, &startq;Nor long &s;halt thou lift the &s;pear,
mildly &s;hining beam of youth! Death &s;tands dim behind thee,
like the darkened half of the moon behind its growing light<NOTE N="&ast;&ast;" PLACE="foot">P. 146.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>Another in&s;tance of the &s;ame nature may be taken from mi&s;t,
which, as being a very familiar appearance in the country of O&s;&s;ian,
he applies to a variety of purpo&s;es, and pur&s;ues through a great
many forms. Sometimes, which one would hardly expect, he em|ploys
it to heighten the appearance of a beautiful object. The hair
of Morna is &startq;like the mi&s;t of Cromla, when it curls on the rock,
and &s;hines to the beam of the we&s;t<NOTE N="&dagger;&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 8.</NOTE>.&endq;&mdash;&startq;The &s;ong comes with its
mu&s;ick to melt and plea&s;e the ear. It is like &s;oft mi&s;t, that ri&s;ing
from a lake, pours on the &s;ilent vale. The green flowers are
filled with dew. The &s;un returns in its &s;trength, and the mi&s;t is
gone<NOTE N="&Dagger;&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 215. There is a remarkable propriety in this compari&s;on. It is in|tended to explain the effect of &s;oft and mournful mu&s;ick. Armin appears di&s;|turbed at a performance of this kind. Carmor &s;ays to him, &startq;Why bur&s;ts the &s;igh of Armin? Is there a cau&s;e to mourn?

<PB N="56" REF="58">
of &s;ome di&s;agreeable or terrible object. &startq;The &s;oul of Nathos
was &s;ad, like the &s;un in the day of mi&s;t, when his face is watery

&s;lowly vani&s;hing, to &startq;mi&s;t that melts by degrees on the &s;unny
hill<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">P. 101.</NOTE>.&endq; But of all the &s;imiles founded on mi&s;t, the mo&s;t highly
fini&s;hed, is that wherein Cairbar, after his treacherous a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of
O&s;car, is compared to a pe&s;tilential fog. &startq;I love a foe like Cath|mor,&endq;
&s;ays Fingal, &startq;his &s;oul is great; his arm is &s;trong; his
battles are full of fame. But the little &s;oul is like a vapour that
hovers round the mar&s;hy lake. It never ri&s;es on the green hill,
le&s;t the winds meet it there. Its dwelling is in the cave; and it
&s;ends forth the dart of death<NOTE N="&ast;&ast;" PLACE="foot">P. 189.</NOTE>.&endq; The&s;e in&s;tances may &s;ufficiently
&s;hew with what richne&s;s of imagination O&s;&s;ian's compari&s;ons abound,
and at the &s;ame time, with what propriety of judgment they are
employed. If his field was narrow, it mu&s;t be admitted to have
been as well cultivated as its extent would allow.</P>
<P>As it is u&s;ual to judge of poets from a compari&s;on of their &s;imiles
more than of other pa&s;&s;ages, it will perhaps be agreeable to the
reader, to &s;ee how Homer and O&s;&s;ian have conducted &s;ome images
of the &s;ame kind. This might be &s;hewn in many in&s;tances. For
as the great objects of nature are common to the poets of all nations,
and make the general &s;tore-hou&s;e of all imagery, the ground-work
of their compari&s;ons mu&s;t of cour&s;e be frequently the &s;ame. I &s;hall
&s;elect only a few of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable from both poets. Mr.
Pope's tran&s;lation of Homer can be of no u&s;e to us here. The pa|rallel
is altogether unfair between pro&s;e, and the impo&s;ing harmony
of flowing numbers. It is only by viewing Homer in the &s;implicity
of a pro&s;e tran&s;lation, that we can form any compari&s;on between the
two bards.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="59">
The &s;hock of two encountering armies, the noi&s;e and the tumult
of battle, afford one of the mo&s;t grand and awful &s;ubjects of de|&s;cription;
on which all Epic poets have exerted their &s;trength. Let
us fir&s;t hear Homer. The following de&s;cription is a favourite one,
for we find it twice repeated in the &s;ame words<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Iliad iv. 446. and Il. viii. 60.</NOTE>. &startq;When now
the conflicting ho&s;ts joined in the field of battle, then were mu|tually
oppo&s;ed &s;hields, and &s;words, and the &s;trength of armed
men. The bo&s;&s;y bucklers were da&s;hed again&s;t each other. The
univer&s;al tumult ro&s;e. There were mingled the triumphant &s;houts
and the dying groans of the victors and the vanqui&s;hed. The
earth &s;treamed with blood. As when winter torrents, ru&s;hing
from the mountains, pour into a narrow valley, their violent wa|ters.
They i&s;&s;ue from a thou&s;and &s;prings, and mix in the
hollowed channel. The di&s;tant &s;hepherd hears on the mountain,
their roar from afar. Such was the terror and the &s;hout of the
engaging armies.&endq; In another pa&s;&s;age, the poet, much in the
manner of O&s;&s;ian, heaps &s;imile on &s;imile, to expre&s;s the va&s;tne&s;s of
the idea, with which his imagination &s;eems to labour. &startq;With a
mighty &s;hout the ho&s;ts engage. Not &s;o loud roars the wave of
ocean, when driven again&s;t the &s;hore by the whole force of the
boi&s;terous north; not &s;o loud in the woods of the mountain, the
noi&s;e of the flame, when ri&s;ing in its fury to con&s;ume the fore&s;t;
not &s;o loud the wind among the lofty oaks, when the wrath of
the &s;torm rages; as was the clamour of the Greeks and Tro|jans,

<P>To the&s;e de&s;criptions and &s;imiles, we may oppo&s;e the following
from O&s;&s;ian, and leave the reader to judge between them. He will
find images of the &s;ame kind employed; commonly le&s;s extended;
but thrown forth with a glowing rapidity which characteri&s;es our
poet. &startq;As autumn's dark &s;torms pour from two echoing hills,
towards each other, approached the heroes. As two dark
&s;treams from high rocks meet, and mix, and roar on the plain;
loud, rough, and dark in battle, meet Lochlin and Ini&s;fail.
Chief mixed his &s;trokes with chief, and man with man. Steel

&startq;beholds from the rock, a cloud borne along the &s;ea by the
we&s;tern wind; black as pitch it appears from afar, &s;ailing over
the ocean, and carrying the dreadful &s;torm. He &s;hrinks at the
&s;ight, and drives his flock into the cave: Such, under the Ajaces,
moved on, the dark, the thickened phalanx to the war<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Iliad iv. 275.</NOTE>.&endq;
&mdash;&startq;They came,&endq; &s;ays O&s;&s;ian, &startq;over the de&s;ert like &s;tormy

are tinged with lightening; and the echoing groves fore&s;ee the
&s;torm<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">P. 109.</NOTE>.&endq; The edges of the cloud tinged with lightning, is a
&s;ublime idea; but the &s;hepherd and his flock, render Homer's &s;imile
more picture&s;que. This is frequently the difference between the
two poets. O&s;&s;ian gives no more than the main image, &s;trong and
full. Homer adds circum&s;tances and appendages, which amu&s;e the
fancy by enlivening the &s;cenery.</P>

extremely noble, and complete in all its parts. &startq;Cairbar heard
their words in &s;ilence, like the cloud of a &s;hower; it &s;tands dark

is, in like manner, compared by O&s;&s;ian, to a &s;tar or meteor.
&startq;Fingal, tall in his &s;hip, &s;tretched his bright lance before him.

<P>A tree cut down, or overthrown by a &s;torm, is a &s;imilitude fre|quent
among poets for de&s;cribing the fall of a warrior in battle.
Homer employs it often. But the mo&s;t beautiful, by far, of his
compari&s;ons, founded on this object, indeed one of the mo&s;t beau|tiful
in the whole Iliad, is that on the death of Euphorbus. &startq;As
the young and verdant olive, which a man hath reared with care
in a lonely field, where the &s;prings of water bubble around it; it
is fair and flouri&s;hing; it is fanned by the breath of all the
winds, and loaded with white blo&s;&s;oms; when the &s;udden bla&s;t
of a whirlwind de&s;cending, roots it out from its bed, and &s;tretches
it on the du&s;t<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Iliad xvii. 53.</NOTE>.&endq; To this, elegant as it is, we may oppo&s;e the
following &s;imile of O&s;&s;ian's, relating to the death of the three &s;ons
of U&s;noth. &startq;They fell, like three young oaks which &s;tood alone
on the hill. The traveller &s;aw the lovely trees, and wondered
how they grew &s;o lonely. The bla&s;t of the de&s;ert came by night,
and laid their green heads low. Next day he returned; but they
were withered, and the heath was bare<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 170.</NOTE>.&endq; Malvina's allu&s;ion to
the &s;ame object, in her lamentation over O&s;car, is &s;o exqui&s;itely
tender, that I cannot forbear giving it a place al&s;o. &startq;I was a
lovely tree in thy pre&s;ence, O&s;car! with all my branches round
me. But thy death came, like a bla&s;t from the de&s;ert, and laid
my green head low. The &s;pring returned with its &s;howers; but
no leaf of mine aro&s;e<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P. 250.</NOTE>.&endq; Several of O&s;&s;ian's &s;imiles taken from
trees, are remarkably beautiful, and diver&s;ified with well cho&s;en
circum&s;tances; &s;uch as that upon the death of Ryno and Orla:
&startq;They have fallen like the oak of the de&s;ert; when it lies acro&s;s a
&s;tream, and withers in the wind of the mountains<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">P. 70.</NOTE>:&endq; Or that which

<P>As Homer exalts his heroes by comparing them to gods, O&s;&s;ian
makes the &s;ame u&s;e of compari&s;ons taken from &s;pirits and gho&s;ts.

Swaran &startq;roared in battle, like the &s;hrill &s;pirit of a &s;torm that &s;its

&s;trength; for very &s;eldom have &s;upernatural beings been painted
with &s;o much &s;ublimity, and &s;uch force of imagination, as by this
poet. Even Homer, great as he is, mu&s;t yield to him in &s;imiles
formed upon the&s;e. Take, for in&s;tance, the following, which is
the mo&s;t remarkable of this kind in the Iliad. &startq;Meriones followed
Idomeneus to battle, like Mars the de&s;troyer of men, when he
ru&s;hes to war. Terror, his beloved &s;on, &s;trong and fierce, at|tends
him; who fills with di&s;may, the mo&s;t valiant hero. They
come from Thrace, armed again&s;t the Ephyrians and Phlegyans;
nor do they regard the prayers of either; but di&s;po&s;e of &s;ucce&s;s at
their will<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Iliad xiii. 298.</NOTE>.&endq; The idea here, is undoubtedly noble: But ob&s;erve
what a figure O&s;&s;ian &s;ets before the a&s;toni&s;hed imagination, and with
what &s;ublimely terrible circum&s;tances he has heightened it. &startq;He
ru&s;hed in the &s;ound of his arms, like the dreadful &s;pirit of Loda,
when he comes in the roar of a thou&s;and &s;torms, and &s;catters
battles from his eyes. He &s;its on a cloud over Lochlin's &s;eas.
His mighty hand is on his &s;word. The winds lift his flaming
locks. So terrible was Cuchullin in the day of his fame<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P. 151.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>Homer's compari&s;ons relate chiefly to martial &s;ubjects, to the ap|pearances
and motions of armies, the engagement and death of he|roes,
and the various incidents of war. In O&s;&s;ian, we find a greater
variety of other &s;ubjects illu&s;trated by &s;imiles; particularly, the
&s;ongs of bards, the beauty of women, the differnt circum&s;tances
of old age, &s;orrow, and private di&s;tre&s;s; which give occa&s;ion
to much beautiful imagery. What, for in&s;tance, can be more
delicate and moving, than the following &s;imile of Oithona's,
in her lamentation over the di&s;honour &s;he had &s;uffered? &startq;Chief of
<PB N="62" REF="64">
Strumon, replied the &s;ighing maid, why did&s;t thou come over

The mu&s;ick of bards, a favourite object with O&s;&s;ian, is illu&s;trated
by a variety of the mo&s;t beautiful appearances that are to be found in
nature. It is compared to the calm &s;hower of &s;pring; to the dews
of the morning on the hill of roes; to the face of the blue and &s;till
lake<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vid. p. 215, 18, 35, 194.</NOTE>. Two &s;imiles on this &s;ubject, I &s;hall quote, becau&s;e they
would do honour to any of the mo&s;t celebrated cla&s;&s;ics. The one
is; &startq;Sit thou on the heath, O bard! and let us hear thy voice;
it is plea&s;ant as the gale of the &s;pring that &s;ighs on the hunter's
ear, when he wakens from dreams of joy, and has heard the
mu&s;ic of the &s;pirits of the hill<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 72.</NOTE>.&endq; The other contains a &s;hort,
but exqui&s;itely tender image, accompanied with the fine&s;t poetical
painting. &startq;The mu&s;ic of Carryl was like the memory of joys
that are pa&s;t, plea&s;ant and mournful to the &s;oul. The gho&s;ts of
departed bards heard it from Slimora's &s;ide. Soft &s;ounds &s;pread
along the wood; and the &s;ilent valleys of night rejoice<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">P. 147.</NOTE>.&endq; What
a figure would &s;uch imagery and &s;uch &s;cenery have made, had they
been pre&s;ented to us, adorned with the &s;weetne&s;s and harmony of
the Virgilian numbers!</P>
<P>I have cho&s;en all along to compare O&s;&s;ian with Homer, rather
than Virgil, for an obvious rea&s;on. There is a much nearer corre&s;|pondence
between the times and manners of the two former poets.
Both wrote in an early period of &s;ociety; both are originals; both
are di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;implicity, &s;ublimity, and fire. The correct
elegance of Virgil, his artful imitation of Homer, the Roman &s;tate|line&s;s
which he every where maintains, admit no parallel with the
abrupt boldne&s;s, and enthu&s;ia&s;tick warmth of the Celtic bard. In
one article, indeed, there is a re&s;emblance. Virgil is more tender
than Homer; and thereby agrees more with O&s;&s;ian; with this dif|ference,
that the feelings of the one are more gentle and poli&s;hed,
tho&s;e of the other, more &s;trong; the tenderne&s;s of Virgil &s;oftens,
that of O&s;&s;ian di&s;&s;olves and overcomes the heart.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="65">
A re&s;emblance may be &s;ometimes ob&s;erved between O&s;&s;ian's com|pari&s;ons,
and tho&s;e employed by the &s;acred writers. They abound
much in this figure, and they u&s;e it with the utmo&s;t propriety<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Dr. Lowth de Sacra Poe&s;i Hebraeorum.</NOTE>.
The imagery of Scripture exhibits a &s;oil and climate altogether dif|ferent
from tho&s;e of O&s;&s;ian; a warmer country, a more &s;miling
face of nature, the arts of agriculture and of rural life much farther
advanced. The wine pre&s;s, and the thre&s;hing floor, are often pre|&s;ented
to us, the Cedar and the Palm-tree, the fragrance of per|fumes,
the voice of the Turtle, and the beds of Lillies. The
&s;imiles are, like O&s;&s;ian's, generally &s;hort, touching on one point of
re&s;emblance, rather than &s;pread out into little epi&s;odes. In the fol|lowing
example, may be perceived what inexpre&s;&s;ible grandeur
poetry receives from the intervention of the Deity. &startq;The nations
&s;hall ru&s;h like the ru&s;hings of many waters; but God &s;hall re|buke
them, and they &s;hall fly far off, and &s;hall be cha&s;ed as
the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and like the down of
the thi&s;tle before the whirlwind<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah xvii. 13.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>Be&s;ides formal compari&s;ons, the poetry of O&s;&s;ian is embelli&s;hed
with many beautiful metaphors: Such as that remarkably fine one
applied to Deugala; &startq;She was covered with the light of beauty;
but her heart was the hou&s;e of pride<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 31.</NOTE>.&endq; This mode of expre&s;|&s;ion,
which &s;uppre&s;&s;es the mark of compari&s;on, and &s;ub&s;titutes a
figured de&s;cription in room of the object de&s;cribed, is a great en|livener
of &s;tyle. It denotes that glow and rapidity of fancy, which
without pau&s;ing to form a regular &s;imile, paints the object at one
&s;troke. &startq;Thou art to me the beam of the ea&s;t, ri&s;ing in a land
unknown<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">P. 244.</NOTE>.&endq;&mdash;&startq;In peace, thou art the gale of &s;pring; in war,
the mountain &s;torm<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P. 78.</NOTE>.&endq;&mdash;&startq;Plea&s;ant be thy re&s;t, O lovely beam,
&s;oon ha&s;t thou &s;et on our hills! The &s;teps of thy departure were
&s;tately, like the moon on the blue trembling wave. But thou
ha&s;t left us in darkne&s;s, fir&s;t of the maids of Lutha!&mdash;Soon ha&s;t
thou &s;et Malvina! but thou ri&s;e&s;t, like the beam of the ea&s;t,
among the &s;pirits of thy friends, where they &s;it in their &s;tormy
halls, the chambers of the thunder<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">P. 259.</NOTE>.&endq; This is correct and
finely &s;upported. But in the following in&s;tance, the metaphor,
<PB N="64" REF="66">
though very beautiful at the beginning, becomes imperfect before it
clo&s;es, by being improperly mixed with the literal &s;en&s;e. &startq;Trothal
went forth with the &s;tream of his people; but they met a rock;
Fingal &s;tood unmoved; broken they rolled back from his &s;ide.
Nor did they roll in &s;afety; the &s;pear of the king pur&s;ued their
flight<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P. 202.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>The hyperbole is a figure which we might expect to find often
employed by O&s;&s;ian; as the undi&s;ciplined imagination of early ages
generally prompts exaggeration, and carries its objects to exce&s;s;
whereas longer experience, and farther progre&s;s in the arts of life,
cha&s;ten mens ideas and expre&s;&s;ions. Yet O&s;&s;ian's hyperboles appear
not to me, either &s;o frequent or &s;o har&s;h as might at fir&s;t have been
looked for; an advantage owing no doubt to the more cultivated &s;tate,
in which, as was before &s;hewn, poetry &s;ub&s;i&s;ted among the ancient
Celtae, than among mo&s;t other barbarous nations. One of the mo&s;t
exaggerated de&s;criptions in the whole work, is what meets us at the
beginning of Fingal, where the &s;cout makes his report to Cuchullin
of the landing of the foe. But this is &s;o far from de&s;erving cen&s;ure,
that it merits prai&s;e, as being, on that occa&s;ion, natural and proper.
The &s;cout arrives, trembling and full of fears; and it is well known,
that no pa&s;&s;ion di&s;po&s;es men to hyperbolize more than terror. It
both annihilates them&s;elves in their own apprehen&s;ion, and mag|nifies
every object which they view through the medium of a
troubled imagination. Hence all tho&s;e indi&s;tinct images of formidable
greatne&s;s, the natural marks of a di&s;turbed and confu&s;ed mind,
which occur in Moran's de&s;cription of Swaran's appearance, and in
his relation of the conference which they held together; not unlike
the report, which the affrighted Jewi&s;h &s;pies made to their leader of
the land of Canaan. &startq;The land through which we have gone to
&s;earch it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and
all the people that we &s;aw in it, are men of a great &s;tature: and
there &s;aw we giants, the &s;ons of Anak, which come of the giants;
and we were in our own &s;ight as gra&s;&s;hoppers, and &s;o were we
in their &s;ight<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Numbers xiii. 32, 33.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="67">
With regard to per&s;onifications, I formerly ob&s;erved that O&s;&s;ian
was &s;paring, and I accounted for his being &s;o. Allegorica per|&s;onages
he has none; and their ab&s;ence is not to be regretted. For
the intermixture of tho&s;e &s;hadowy Beings, which have not the &s;up|port
even of mythological or legendary belief, with human actors,
&s;eldom produces a good effect. The fiction becomes too vi&s;ible and
phanta&s;tick; and overthrows that impre&s;&s;ion of reality, which the
probable recital of human actions is calculated to make upon the
mind. In the &s;erious and pathetick &s;cenes of O&s;&s;ian e&s;pecially, allego|rical
characters would have been as much out of place, as in Tra|gedy;
&s;erving only un&s;ea&s;onably to amu&s;e the fancy, whil&s;t they
&s;topped the current, and weakened the force of pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>With apo&s;trophes, or addre&s;&s;es to per&s;ons ab&s;ent or dead, which
have been, in all ages, the language of pa&s;&s;ion, our poet abounds;
and they are among his highe&s;t beauties. Wi$ne&s;s the apo&s;trophe,
in the fir&s;t book of Fingal, to the maid of Ini&s;tore, who&s;e lover had
fallen in battle; and that inimitably fine one of Cuchullin to Bra|gela
at the conclu&s;ion of the &s;ame book. He commands the harp
to be &s;truck in her prai&s;e; and the mention of Bragela's name, im|mediately
&s;ugge&s;ting to him a crowd of tender ideas; &startq;Do&s;t thou
rai&s;e thy fair face from the rocks,&endq; he exclaims, &startq;to find the
&s;ails of Cuchullin? The &s;ea is rolling far di&s;tant, and its white
foam &s;hall deceive thee for my &s;ails.&endq; And now his imagination
being wrought up to conceive her as, at that moment, really in this
&s;ituation, he becomes afraid of the harm &s;he may receive from the
inclemency of the night; and with an enthu&s;ia&s;m, happy and af|fecting,
though beyond the cautious &s;train of modern poetry, &startq;Re|tire,&endq;
he proceeds, &startq;retire, for it is night, my love, and the

In one pa&s;&s;age only of the addre&s;s to the moon, there appears &s;ome
ob&s;curity. &startq;Whither do&s;t thou retire from thy cour&s;e, when the
darkne&s;s of thy countenance grows? Ha&s;t thou thy hall like
O&s;&s;ian? Dwelle&s;t thou in the &s;hadow of grief? Have thy &s;i&s;ters
fallen from heaven? Are they who rejoiced with thee at night,
no more? Yes, they have fallen, fair light! and thou do&s;t often
retire to mourn.&endq; We may be at a lo&s;s to comprehend, at fir&s;t
view, the ground of the&s;e &s;peculations of O&s;&s;ian, concerning the
moon; but when all the circum&s;tances are attended to, they will
appear to flow naturally from the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of his mind. A
mind under the dominion of any &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion, tinctures with its
own di&s;po&s;ition, every object which it beholds. The old bard, with
his heart bleeding for the lo&s;s of all his friends, is meditating on the
different pha&s;es of the moon. Her waning and darkne&s;s, pre&s;ents
to his melancholy imagination, the image of &s;orrow; and pre&s;ently
the idea ari&s;es, and is indulged, that, like him&s;elf, &s;he retires to
mourn over the lo&s;s of other moons, or of &s;tars, whom he calls her
&s;i&s;ters, and fancies to have once rejoiced with her at night, now
fallen from heaven. Darkne&s;s &s;ugge&s;ted the idea of mourning; and
mourning &s;ugge&s;ted nothing &s;o naturally to O&s;&s;ian, as the death of
beloved friends. An in&s;tance preci&s;ely &s;imilar of this influence of
pa&s;&s;ion, may be &s;een in a pa&s;&s;age which has always been admired

The apo&s;trophe to the winds, in the opening of Darthula, is in
the highe&s;t &s;pirit of poetry. &startq;But the winds deceive thee, O
Darthula! and deny the woody Etha to thy &s;ails. The&s;e are
not thy mountains, Nathos, nor is that the roar of thy climbing

foe lift their head.&mdash;Where have ye been, ye &s;outhern winds;
when the &s;ons of my love were deceived? But ye have been

<P>Having now treated fully of O&s;&s;ian's talents, with re&s;pect to de|&s;cription
and imagery, it only remains to make &s;ome ob&s;ervations on
his &s;entiments. No &s;entiments can be beautiful without being pro|per;
that is, &s;uited to the character and &s;ituation of tho&s;e who utter
them. In this re&s;pect, O&s;&s;ian is as correct as mo&s;t writers. His
characters, as above ob&s;erved, are in general well &s;upported; which
could not have been the ca&s;e, had the &s;entiments been unnatural
or out of place. A variety of per&s;onages of different ages, &s;exes, and
conditions, are introduced into his poems; and they &s;peak and act
with a propriety of &s;entiment and behaviour, which it is &s;urpri&s;ing
to find in &s;o rude an age. Let the poem of Darthula, throughout,
be taken as an example.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="70">
But it is not enough that &s;entiments be natural and proper. In
order to acquire any high degree of poetical merit, they mu&s;t al&s;o be
&s;ublime and pathetick.</P>
<P>The &s;ublime is not confined to &s;entiment alone. It belongs to de|&s;cription
al&s;o; and whether in de&s;cription or in &s;entiment, imports
&s;uch ideas pre&s;ented to the mind, as rai&s;e it to an uncommon degree
of elevation, and fill it with admiration and a&s;toni&s;hment. This is
the highe&s;t effect either of eloquence or poetry: And to produce
this effect, requires a genius glowing with the &s;tronge&s;t and warme&s;t
conception of &s;ome object awful, great or magnificent. That this
character of genius belongs to O&s;&s;ian, may, I think, &s;ufficiently ap|pear
from many of the pa&s;&s;ages I have already had occa&s;ion to quote.
To produce more in&s;tances, were &s;uperfluous. If the engagement
of Fingal with the &s;pirit of Loda, in Carric-thura; if the encoun|ters
of the armies, in Fingal; if the addre&s;s to the &s;un, in Carthon;
if the &s;imiles founded upon gho&s;ts and &s;pirits of the night, all for|merly
mentioned, be not admitted as examples, and illu&s;trious ones
too, of the true poetical &s;ublime, I confe&s;s my&s;elf entirely ignorant
of this quality in writing.</P>
<P>All the circum&s;tances, indeed, of O&s;&s;ian's compo&s;ition, are fa|vourable
to the &s;ublime, more perhaps than to any other &s;pecies of
beauty. Accuracy and correctne&s;s; artfully connected narration;
exact method and proportion of parts, we may look for in poli&s;hed
times. The gay and the beautiful, will appear to more advantage
in the mid&s;t of &s;miling &s;cenery and plea&s;urable themes. But amid&s;t
the rude &s;cenes of nature, amid&s;t rocks and torrents and whirlwinds
and battles, dwells the &s;ublime. It is the thunder and the lightning
of genius. It is the off&s;pring of nature, not of art. It is negligent
of all the le&s;&s;er graces, and perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with a certain noble
di&s;order. It a&s;&s;ociates naturally with that grave and &s;olemn &s;pirit,
which di&s;tingui&s;hes our author. For the &s;ublime, is an awful and
&s;erious emotion; and is heightened by all the images of Trouble,
and Terror, and Darkne&s;s.</P>

<P>Simplicity and conci&s;ene&s;s, are never-failing characteri&s;tics of the
&s;tile of a &s;ublime writer. He re&s;ts on the maje&s;ty of his &s;entiments,
not on the pomp of his expre&s;&s;ions. The main &s;ecret of being
&s;ublime, is to &s;ay great things in few, and in plain words: For
every &s;uperfluous decoration degrades a &s;ublime idea. The mind
ri&s;es and &s;wells, when a lofty de&s;cription or &s;entiment is pre&s;ented to
it, in its native form. But no &s;ooner does the poet attempt to &s;pread
out this &s;entiment or de&s;cription, and to deck it round and round
with glittering ornaments, than the mind begins to fall from its
high elevation; the tran&s;port is over; the beautiful may remain,
but the &s;ublime is gone. Hence the conci&s;e and &s;imple &s;tyle of
O&s;&s;ian, gives great advantage to his &s;ublime conceptions; and a&s;&s;i&s;ts
them in &s;eizing the imagination with full power<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The noted &s;aying of Julius Cae&s;ar, to the pilot in a &s;torm; &startq;Quid times?

<P>Sublimity as belonging to &s;entiment, coincides in a great mea&s;ure
with magnanimity, heroi&s;m, and genero&s;ity of &s;entiment. What|ever
di&s;covers human nature in its greate&s;t elevation; whatever be|&s;peaks
a high effort of &s;oul; or &s;hews a mind &s;uperior to plea&s;ures,
<PB N="70" REF="72">
to dangers, and to death, forms what may be called the moral or
&s;entimental &s;ublime. For this, O&s;&s;ian is eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed.
No poet maintains a higher tone of virtuous and noble &s;enti|ment,
throughout all his works. Particularly in all the &s;en|timents
of Fingal, there is a grandeur and loftine&s;s proper to &s;well
the mind with the highe&s;t ideas of human perfection. Wherever
he appears, we behold the hero. The objects which he pur&s;ues,
are always truly great; to bend the proud; to protect the injured;
to defend his friends; to overcome his enemies by genero&s;ity more
than by force. A portion of the &s;ame &s;pirit actuate&s; all the other
heroes. Valour reigns; but it is a generous valour, void of cruelty,
animated by honour, not by hatred. We behold no deba&s;ing pa&s;|&s;ions
among Fingal's warriors; no &s;pirit of avarice or of in&s;ult;
but a perpetual contention for fame; a de&s;ire of being di&s;tingui&s;hed
and remembered for gallant actions; a love of ju&s;tice; and a zea|lous
attachment to their friends and their country. Such is the
&s;train of &s;entiment in the works of O&s;&s;ian.</P>
<P>But the &s;ublimity of moral &s;entiments, if they wanted the &s;often|ing
of the tender, would be an hazard of giving a hard and &s;tiff
air to poetry. It is not enough to admire. Admiration is a cold
feeling, in compari&s;on of that deep intere&s;t, which the heart takes
in tender and pathetick &s;cenes; where, by a my&s;terious attachment
to the objects of compa&s;&s;ion, we are plea&s;ed and delighted, even
whil&s;t we mourn. With &s;cenes of this kind, O&s;&s;ian abounds; and
his high merit in the&s;e, is inconte&s;table. He may be blamed for
drawing tears too often from our eyes; but that he has the power
of commanding them, I believe no man, who has the lea&s;t &s;en&s;ibi|lity,
will que&s;tion. The general character of his poetry, is the he|roic
mixed with the elegiac &s;train; admiration tempered with
pity. Ever fond of giving, as he expre&s;&s;es it, &startq;the joy of grief,&endq;
it is vi&s;ible, that on all moving &s;ubjects, he delights to exert his ge|nius;
and accordingly, never were there finer pathetick &s;ituations,
than what his works pre&s;ent. His great art in managing them, lies
in giving vent to the &s;imple and natural emotions of the heart. We
meet with no exaggerated declamation; no &s;ubtile refinements on
&s;orrow; no &s;ub&s;titution of de&s;cription in place of pa&s;&s;ion. O&s;&s;ian
felt &s;trongly him&s;elf; and the heart when uttering its native lan|guage
<PB N="71" REF="73">
never fails, by powerful &s;ympathy, to affect the heart. A
great variety of examples might be produced. We need only open
the book to find them every where. What, for in&s;tance, can be
more moving, than the lamentations of Oithona, after her mi&s;for|tune?
Gaul, the &s;on of Morni, her lover, ignorant of what &s;he had
&s;uffered, comes to her re&s;cue. Their meeting is tender in the
highe&s;t degree. He propo&s;es to engage her foe, in &s;ingle combat,
and gives her in charge what &s;he is to do, if he him&s;elf &s;hall fall.
&startq;And &s;hall the daughter of Nu&auml;th live, &s;he replied with a bur&s;ting
&s;igh? Shall I live in Tromathon, and the &s;on of Morni low?
My heart is not of that rock; nor my &s;oul carele&s;s as that &s;ea,
which lifts its blue waves to every wind, and rolls beneath the
&s;torm. The bla&s;t, which &s;hall lay thee low, &s;hall &s;pread the
branches of Oithona on earth. We &s;hall wither together, &s;on of
car-borne Morni! The narrow hou&s;e is plea&s;ant to me; and the
grey &s;tone of the dead; for never more will I leave thy rocks, &s;ea-&s;urrounded
Tromathon!&mdash;Chief of Strumon, why came&s;t thou
over the waves to Nu&auml;th's mournful daughter? Why did not I
pa&s;s away in &s;ecret, like the flower of the rock, that lifts its fair
head un&s;een, and &s;trews its withered leaves on the bla&s;t? Why
did&s;t thou come, O Gaul! to hear my departing &s;igh?&mdash;O had
I dwelt at Duvranna, in the bright beams of my fame! Then
had my years come on with joy; and the virgins would ble&s;s my
&s;teps. But I fall in youth, &s;on of Morni, and my father &s;hall
blu&s;h in his hall<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P. 244, 245, 248.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>Oithona mourns like a woman; in Cuchullin's expre&s;&s;ions of
grief after his defeat, we behold the &s;entiments of a hero, generous
but de&s;ponding. The &s;ituation is remarkably fine. Cuchullin,
rouzed from his cave, by the noi&s;e of battle, &s;ees Fingal victorious
in the field. He is de&s;cribed as kindling at the &s;ight. &startq;His hand
is on the &s;word of his fathers; his red-rolling eyes on the foe.
He thrice attempted to ru&s;h to battle; and thrice did Connal &s;top
him;&endq; &s;ugge&s;ting, that Fingal was routing the foe; and that he
ought not by the &s;how of &s;uperfluous aid, to deprive the king of any
part of the honour of a victory, which was owing to him alone.
<PB N="72" REF="74">
Cuchullin yields to this generous &s;entiment; but we &s;ee it &s;tinging
him to the heart with the &s;en&s;e of his own di&s;grace. &startq;Then,
Carril, go, replied the chief, and greet the king of Morven.
When Lochlin falls away like a &s;tream after rain, and the noi&s;e
of the battle is over. Then be thy voice &s;weet in his ear, to
prai&s;e the king of &s;words. Give him the &s;word of Caithbat; for
Cuchullin is worthy no more to lift the arms of his fathers. But,
O ye gho&s;ts of the lonely Cromla! Ye &s;ouls of chiefs that are no
more! Be ye the companions of Cuchullin, and talk to him in
the cave of his &s;orrow. For never more &s;hall I be renowned
among the mighty in the land. I am like a beam that has &s;hone:
Like a mi&s;t that has fled away; when the bla&s;t of the morning
came, and brightened the &s;haggy &s;ide of the hill. Connal! Talk
of arms no more: Departed is my fame. My &s;ighs &s;hall be on
Cromla's wind; till my foot&s;teps cea&s;e to be &s;een. And thou,

<P>Be&s;ides &s;uch extended pathetick &s;cenes, O&s;&s;ian frequently pierces
the heart by a &s;ingle unexpected &s;troke. When O&s;car fell in battle,
&startq;No father mourned his &s;on &s;lain in youth; no brother, his bro|ther
of love; they fell without tears, for the chief of the people
was low<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 182.</NOTE>.&endq; In the admirable interview of Hector with An|dromache,
in the &s;ixth Iliad, the circum&s;tance of the child in his
nurse's arms, has often been remarked, as adding much to the ten|derne&s;s
of the &s;cene. In the following pa&s;&s;age relating to the death
of Cuchullin, we find a circum&s;tance that mu&s;t &s;trike the imagina|tion
with &s;till greater force. &startq;And is the &s;on of Semo fallen?
&s;aid Carril with a &s;igh. Mournful are Tura's walls, and &s;orrow

he is calling, after his accu&s;tomed manner, his &s;ons to the chace.

<BIBL>Othello, Act. 5. Scene 7.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>The contrivance of the incident in both poets is &s;imilar; but the
circum&s;tances are varied with judgment. Othello dwells upon the
name of wife, when it had fallen from him, with the confu&s;ion
and horror of one tortured with guilt. Fingal, with the dignity of
a hero, corrects him&s;elf, and &s;uppre&s;&s;es his ri&s;ing grief.</P>
<P>The contra&s;t which O&s;&s;ian frequently makes between his pre&s;ent
and his former &s;tate, diffu&s;es over his whole poetry, a &s;olemn pathe|tick
air, which cannot fail to make impre&s;&s;ion on every heart. The
conclu&s;ion of the &s;ongs of Selma, is particularly calculated for this
purpo&s;e. Nothing can be more poetical and tender, or can leave
upon the mind, a &s;tronger, and more affecting idea of the venerable
aged bard. &startq;Such were the words of the bards in the days of the
&s;ong; when the king heard the mu&s;ic of harps, and the tales of
other times. The chiefs gathered from all their hills, and heard
the lovely &s;ound. They prai&s;ed the voice of Cona<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">O&s;&s;ian him&s;elf is poetically called</NOTE>; the fir&s;t
among a thou&s;and bards. But age is now on my tongue, and my
&s;oul has failed. I hear, &s;ometimes, the gho&s;ts of bards, and learn
their plea&s;ant &s;ong. But memory fails on my mind; I hear the
call of years. They &s;ay, as they pa&s;s along; why does O&s;&s;ian
&s;ing? Soon &s;hall he lie in the narrow hou&s;e, and no bard &s;hall
rai&s;e his fame. Roll on, ye dark-brown years! for ye bring no
joy in your cour&s;e. Let the tomb open to O&s;&s;ian, for his &s;trength
has failed. The &s;ons of the &s;ong are gone to re&s;t. My voice re|mains,
<PB N="74" REF="76">
like a bla&s;t, that roars lonely on a &s;ea-&s;urrounded rock, af|ter

<P>Upon the whole; if to feel &s;trongly, and to de&s;cribe naturally,
be the two chief ingredients in poetical genius, O&s;&s;ian mu&s;t, after
fair examination, be held to po&s;&s;e&s;s that genius in a high degree.
The que&s;tion is not, whether a few improprieties may be
pointed out in his works; whether this, or that pa&s;&s;age, might
not have been worked up with more art and &s;kill, by &s;ome
writer of happier times? A thou&s;and &s;uch cold and frivolous
critici&s;ms, are altogether indeci&s;ive as to his genuine merit.
But, has he the &s;pirit, the fire, the in&s;piration of a poet? Does he
utter the voice of nature? Does he elevate by his &s;entiments? Does
he intere&s;t by his de&s;criptions? Does he paint to the heart as well as
to the fancy? Does he make his readers glow, and tremble, and
weep? The&s;e are the great chara&s;teri&s;ticks of true poetry. Where
the&s;e are found, he mu&s;t be a minute critic indeed, who can dwell
upon &s;light defects. A few beauties of this high kind, tran&s;cend
whole volumes of faultle&s;s mediocrity. Uncouth and abrupt,
O&s;&s;ian may &s;ometimes appear by rea&s;on of his conci&s;ene&s;s. But he is
&s;ublime, he is pathetick, in an eminent degree. If he has not the
exten&s;ive knowledge, the regular dignity of narration, the fulne&s;s
and accuracy of de&s;cription, which we find in Homer and Virgil,
yet in &s;trength of imagination, in grandeur of &s;entiment, in native
maje&s;ty of pa&s;&s;ion, he is fully their equal. If he flows not always
like a clear &s;tream, yet he breaks forth often like a torrent of fire. Of
art too, he is far from being de&s;titute; and his imagination is re|markable
for delicacy as well as &s;trength. Seldom or never is he ei|ther
trifling or tedious; and if he be thought too melancholy, yet he
is always moral. Though his merit were in other re&s;pects much le&s;s
than it is, this alone ought to entitle him to high regard, that his
writings are remarkably favourable to virtue. They awake the ten|dere&s;t
&s;ympathies, and in&s;pire the mo&s;t generous emotions. No
reader can ri&s;e from him, without being warmed with the &s;enti|ments
of humanity, virtue and honour.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="77">
Though unacquainted with the original language, there is no one
but mu&s;t judge the tran&s;lation to de&s;erve the highe&s;t prai&s;e, on ac|count
of its beauty and elegance. Of its faithfulne&s;s and accuracy,
I have been a&s;&s;ured by per&s;ons &s;killed in the Galic tongue, who
from their youth, were acquainted with many of the&s;e poems of
O&s;&s;ian. To tran&s;fu&s;e &s;uch &s;pirited and fervid ideas from one lan|guage
into another; to tran&s;late literally, and yet with &s;uch a glow
of poetry; to keep alive &s;o much pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;upport &s;o much
dignity throughout, is one of the mo&s;t difficult works of genius,
and proves the tran&s;lator to have been animated with no &s;mall por|tion
of O&s;&s;ian's &s;pirit.</P>
<P>The mea&s;ured pro&s;e which he has employed, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es con&s;ider|able
advantages above any &s;ort of ver&s;ification he could have cho&s;en.
Whil&s;t it plea&s;es and fills the ear with a variety of harmonious ca|dences,
being, at the &s;ame time, freer from con&s;traint in the choice
and arrangement of words, it allows the &s;pirit of the original to be
exhibited with more ju&s;tne&s;s, force, and &s;implicity. Elegant how|ever,
and ma&s;terly as Mr. Macpher&s;on's tran&s;lation is, we mu&s;t
never forget, whil&s;t we read it, that we are putting the merit of
the original to a &s;evere te&s;t. For, we are examining a poet,
&s;tripped of his native dre&s;s; dive&s;ted of the harmony of his own
numbers. We know how much grace and energy the works of the
Greek and Latin poets receive from the charm of ver&s;ification in
their original languages. If then, de&s;titute of this advantage, ex|hibited
in a literal ver&s;ion, O&s;&s;ian &s;till has power to plea&s;e as a poet;
and not to plea&s;e only, but often to command, to tran&s;port, to melt
