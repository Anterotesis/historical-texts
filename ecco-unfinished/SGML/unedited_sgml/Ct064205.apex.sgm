<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE very extraordinary circum&s;tances which attended the hearing, or rather the not hearing of this piece, with the &s;ub&s;equent contentions which it occa&s;ioned, would &s;eem &s;ufficiently to call for its publication: the&s;e circum&s;tances, however, the Author would certainly have foregone, ra|ther than appear to make appeals from the deter|mination of the Public; but having been charged with bringing on a polite Theatre many low and gro&s;s indecencies, many vulgar and improper allu&s;ions, ju&s;tice, and not vanity, obliges him in &s;ome mea&s;ure to re&s;cue him&s;elf from &s;o ungen|tleman-like a conduct. In doing this, however, the Author begs that it may now, as well as for|merly, be perfectly under&s;tood, he could never
<PB N="vi" REF="4">
mean to di&s;pute the judgment, or oppo&s;e the de|cided opinion of the town;&mdash;all he ever wi&s;hed or reque&s;ted was, a fair and candid trial, that their opinion might be &s;upported by dignity and ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Without entering into the rea&s;ons why a piece, which had drawn three of the mo&s;t brilliant au|diences in London, &s;hould be taken from the &s;tage, the Author de&s;ires to &s;ay a few words in his own behalf:&mdash;The amu&s;ement of his lei&s;ure hours was the fir&s;t cau&s;e of his dramatic endea|vours; the indulgence of the public has alone encouraged their continuance, and has always been his be&s;t reward. The ridiculous in&s;inua|tion that pecuniary advantage was the &s;ole ob|ject of his literary pur&s;uits, &s;carcely de&s;erves the Author's &s;erious reply; though had his &s;ituation in life made &s;uch an attention nece&s;&s;ary, he &s;ees no rea&s;on why it &s;hould be branded with re|proach. Circum&s;tanced as he is, he takes the liberty to contradict every a&s;&s;ertion of the kind; nor does he think any impartial per&s;on will ima|gine, he could for a moment wi&s;h to impo&s;e a Drama upon the town again&s;t their con&s;ent, for the trifling con&s;ideration of a night's emolu|ment: on the contrary he &s;aw, or thought he &s;aw, a great majority for two evenings in his
<PB N="vii" REF="5">
favour, and that majority con&s;i&s;ting of many of the fir&s;t and mo&s;t re&s;pectable names in this country.</P>
<P>Mr. Colman, to be &s;ure, as a Gentleman and a man of letters, knowing the difficulties which every dramatic writer is &s;ubject to, and the ene|mies he has to encounter, took a warm and zea|lous part in his &s;upport, for which he &s;hall al|ways think him&s;elf under great obligations: at the &s;ame time he makes no doubt, but Mr. Col|man imagined him&s;elf ju&s;tified in his conduct from the apparent &s;entiments of the audience; for though he might have felt for the Author as a friend, he never could have forgot his own &s;ituation &s;o far, as to pre&s;ume to dictate to the public entertainment in oppo&s;ition to the public voice.</P>
<P>Thus much in ju&s;tification of the repeated en|deavours to have the Comedy quietly repre|&s;ented. That it contains not tho&s;e numerous indelicacies a&s;cribed to it, the Author hopes the peru&s;al of his play will &s;ufficiently prove: in con|tradiction even of &s;uch a de&s;ign, he begs it may be remembered, that having frequently had the honour of bringing his labours before the pub|lic,
<PB N="viii" REF="6">
which they have deigned not to di&s;approve, he has &s;ome rea&s;on to plead pa&s;t conduct in his favour: but were he even weak and ab&s;urd enough to offend &s;eriou&s;ly in this particular, &s;uch indelicacies, he is warranted in &s;aying, could ne|ver have e&s;caped the di&s;cerning and judicious eye of Mr. Colman.</P>
<P>In a word, the Author begs again to repeat, that he does not mean to murmur at the public decree; but having been charged with inten|tions he is not con&s;cious of, and having been unkindly denied a candid hearing, after he had carefully era&s;ed every pa&s;&s;age he could conceive objectionable, he takes the opportunity, when tumult has &s;ub&s;ided, and the voice of conten|tion is heard no more, to leave it in the brea&s;t of every di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate reader to determine, whe|ther dulne&s;s and indecency pervade his &s;cenes throughout.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid thus much in apology for the pre&s;ent publication, it may probably be ex|pected that the Author &s;hould enlarge a little upon the nature of the piece it&s;elf, and account for the novelty which may in &s;ome mea&s;ure have contributed to hurry its fate.&mdash;Characters and
<PB N="ix" REF="7" MS="Y">
&s;ituations drawn from ordinary life, being in every one's view, accommodate them&s;elves to every apprehen&s;ion; but manners and cu&s;toms of other times and countries are not to be go|verned by the &s;tandard of modern and dome&s;tic ob&s;ervation: it is requi&s;ite to con&s;ider how far they accord with the accounts we have of them, before we determine on their merits, and to re|collect that, like &s;trangers at our table, though they may not immediately &s;trike the fancy, yet if received with caution and politene&s;s, we may reli&s;h their conver&s;e as they grow familiar, and they may in the end turn out plea&s;ant compa|nions of our lives.</P>
<P>On peru&s;ing the anecdote from which this play is taken, the Author imagined the &s;tory might &s;ucceed on the &s;tage, by the addition of &s;ome fre&s;h per&s;onages in the Drama, and on that account he introduced the family that are not found in the Novel. To contra&s;t the poverty and pride of the German Baron, with the vul|garity and wealth of a Dutch trader would, as it appeared to him, produce that light and &s;hade &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for dramatic effect; to make the &s;on of that Dutchman the lover and hu&s;band of Cecil was, he thought, the mo&s;t forcible me|thod
<PB N="x" REF="8">
of exciting the Baron's contempt and in|dignation. If it &s;hould be objected that the language of the Hollanders is not polite, he can only an&s;wer, that he &s;hould think it incompa|tible with their &s;ituation; and had he given them ideas, and made them di&s;cour&s;e like people of fa&s;hion, &s;uch a dialogue, &s;o far from heightening the merit of the piece, would, in his opinion, totally have de&s;troyed it. The whim&s;ical words put into the mouths of the Dutchman and his wife, and u&s;ed in &s;ome of their &s;ongs, are ab&s;olutely Dutch phra&s;es and terminations anglici&s;ed; they are not introduced as &s;pecimens of elegant writing, but purpo&s;ely to enforce the characters; and therefore ought not to be tried by the nice rules of refined cri|tici&s;m. The pre&s;ervation of character is, in the Author's opinion, the fir&s;t di&s;tinction of dramatic writing; if he is mi&s;taken, he alone mu&s;t &s;uffer for his error: but however lightly it may re&s;t upon gentlemens' minds to pa&s;s ha&s;ty judgments on the works of others, he hopes it will be con&s;idered how painful it is, to a per&s;on of any &s;en&s;ibility, to experience tho&s;e marked and pub|lic cen&s;ures, which, di&s;tinct from the merits or demerits of the piece, the dramatic, more than any other writer, is often doomed to bear; to
<PB N="xi" REF="9">
have his character arraigned, his private life in|ve&s;tigated, and every &s;entiment of his heart tra|duced and vilified, when the only crime he has committed has been a laudable de&s;ire of hone&s;t fame, and an anxious wi&s;h to entertain the pub|lic, though with abilities perhaps too confined to bring tho&s;e wi&s;hes to perfection.</P>
