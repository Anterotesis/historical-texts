<HEAD>DEDICATION. To DETRACTION.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>High and Mighty Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE attention, with which you have been plea&s;ed to di&s;tingui&s;h this incon&s;iderable production, makes it a duty with me to lay it at your feet. The applau&s;es of the Theatre gave me a&s;&s;urance of its &s;ucce&s;s, but it was your te&s;timony alone, which could in&s;pire me with any opinion of its merit: Nor is it on this occa&s;ion only I am to thank you; in whatever proportion I have been happy enough to attract the regards of the public, in the &s;ame degree I have never failed being honoured with your's.</P>
<P>How I have merited the&s;e marks of your partiality I am not able to gue&s;s: I can take my con&s;cience to witne&s;s, I have paid you no &s;acrifice, devoted no time or &s;tudy to your &s;ervice, nor am a man in any re&s;pect qualified to repay your favors: Give me credit, there|fore, when I tell you, that your liberality oppre&s;&s;es me. Was I apt to rate my preten&s;ions highly, and pre&s;ume upon the indulgence of the public, I might have &s;ome claim to your favor; but 'till you hear me complain that my reward is not equal to my merit, I pray you let me enjoy my content and my ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time that I would gladly withdraw my|&s;elf from your notice, I have no one in my eye whom I would wi&s;h to recommend to it: It is my de&s;ire to put you at your ea&s;e, worn out as you mu&s;t needs be with the toils of your employment; and I &s;eriou&s;ly prote&s;t to you, that if your &s;ilence will be the con&s;e|quence of mine, I am ready to enter with you into ar|ticles whenever you think fit; convinced that I can never benefit mankind &s;o much as by procuring you a la&s;ting repo&s;e; nor would you be long to &s;eek for a retreat; there are many market-towns in the country
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
where you may drink your tea in quiet with a reput|able &s;et of elderly maidens at a di&s;tance from the ca|pital. Above all things I &s;hould humbly recommend it to you, to relieve your&s;elf from your labours in the dramatic walk: Con&s;ider, Sir, the campaign is now opening; I under&s;tand it will be an active one; new competitors will be pre&s;&s;ing forward in the field of fame; I could wi&s;h you to keep out of their way; enervated as you are by pa&s;t exce&s;&s;es, you will be ill able to &s;truggle with the&s;e young and maiden &s;pirits; but if you mu&s;t engage, let it, I pray you, be with &s;ome of your intimates, if you find any on the ground; and do not pur&s;ue tho&s;e mini&s;terial politics, hitherto adopt|ed by you, of be&s;towing all your favours on your op|po&s;ers, and letting your friends go without their re|ward.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t I am con&s;ulting your future repo&s;e, do not think I am unmindful of your pa&s;t renown: It is to you alone, <HI>Mo&s;t mighty Sir,</HI> we owe the great encrea&s;e of <HI>news-papers</HI> (not to mention <HI>magazines, reviews,</HI> &amp;c.) in this metropolis. In former times, the world was contented with a &s;tale recital of <HI>foreign and dome&s;tic occurrences,</HI> which never came to pa&s;s, and a lame ac|count of <HI>ca&s;ualties,</HI> where no mi&s;chief was ever done; now the reader is convey'd under your au&s;pices to the foot of the throne; you have the key that admits him into the cabinets of all the princes in Europe; nay, you can carry him a dance thro' the air, as familiarly as the lame devil did the &s;cholar of Salamanca, and uncover the roofs of our clo&s;ets and chambers to his view: The world is not only &s;upplied with a faithful hi&s;tory of the times in our public prints, but every private family, thro' your means, may meet its own &s;$cret <HI>Atalantis.</HI> The&s;e are advantages, which &s;ome people of confined notions have not clearly under&s;tood, and have ra&s;hly proceeded to oppo&s;e the tyrranny of the law again&s;t the freedom of the pre&s;s; pains and penal|ties have been inflicted, mulcts and impri&s;onments have been put in force again&s;t the conductors of your undertaking; but, thanks to our excellent con&s;titu|tion, you &s;till enjoy your full liberty, though many of your parti&s;ans are abridg'd of theirs.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="4">
The per&s;onal, political and literary characters of men are the three great branches of your &s;tudy; emi|nent have been your re&s;earches in each; but it is not within the compa&s;s of this dedication to follow you thro' any but the latter, and that in the dramatic di|vi&s;ion only: And here I ob&s;erve your ordinary prac|tice hath been as follows:</P>
<P>When any play, like this now &s;ubmitted to the pub|lic, meets a favourable reception on its fir&s;t appearance, the very next morning by break of day out comes your manife&s;to; unravels the whole plot and contri|vance of the drama, di&s;&s;ects the characters, detects the plagiari&s;ms, and kindly tells the town what it is to expect; and all this is the dark operation of one midnight hour, while the poor romantic author lies wrapt perhaps in golden dreams of happine&s;s and &s;uc|ce&s;s: The con&s;equence of this manife&s;to is, the clear|ing up of many mi&s;takes which the public would el&s;e be apt to make: They who have been pleas'd, being told they ought not to have been pleas'd, go no more and avoid an error in judgement; they who would have gone, &s;tay at home and &s;ave their money; the per|formers, whom &s;ucce&s;s might have made giddy, are now prevented from over-acting their &s;everal parts, and &s;ea&s;onably kept down; the author, whom the plaudits of a theatre might have intoxicated to that phrenzy of &s;en&s;ibility, in which we are told that <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Philippides quoque Comaediarum poeta baud ignobilis, quum in certamine poetarum, praeter $Word$ vi$i&s;&s;et, et loeti&s;&s;im&egrave; gauderet, inter illud gaudium repente mortuus e&s;t.</HI> AULUS GELLIUS iii. xv.</NOTE> <HI>Philippides the comic poet</HI> expired, is kept in due regimen, and under no danger of lo&s;ing the moderate &s;hare of &s;en&s;es you allow him: Thus you &s;tand, like the admoni&s;hing &s;lave in the triumph, to remind the conqueror that <HI>he is a man;</HI> if therefore the &s;houts of the people are loud, you hallow in his ear, &s;o as to be heard above the cry; if they are moderate, you whi&s;per; but where the people are &s;ilent, the admonition is unnece&s;&s;ary; and whenever your own friends mount the carr, your delicacy in their in&s;tance is con&s;picuous, by the pro|found taciturnity you ob&s;erve.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="5">
In the in&s;tance of the pre&s;ent imperfect performance (thus laid at your feet) I have had opportunity to ex|perience your concern for me in a peculiar manner: Ill-health, and other melancholy attentions, which I need not explain to you, kept me at a di&s;tance from the &s;cene of its deci&s;ion; on this occa&s;ion you redoub|led your admonitions, apprehen&s;ive, no doubt, that I &s;hould give way to the flattering report of my friends, and fearful that I &s;hould yield to that weakne&s;s, of which the mind, when under the vi&s;itation of affliction, is evidently mo&s;t &s;u&s;ceptible.</P>
<P>Nor is this the only error I might have fallen into&punc; I mu&s;t confe&s;s to you I had vainly flatter'd my&s;elf with the de&s;ign of addre&s;&s;ing this Comedy not to you, <HI>High and Mighty Sir,</HI> but to an amiable and elegant friend, to a lady who&s;e critici&s;ms under favour differ as widely from your's, as <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> does from the author of the <HI>Choleric Man:</HI> This lady, Sir, (who&s;e name I forbear to mention, as it is unknown to you) was called upon in defence of a countryman to enter the li&s;ts, tho' the milde&s;t of human beings, with the renowned <HI>Voltaire</HI> (I do not di&s;gui&s;e his name from you, becau&s;e I think on certain &s;ubjects, e&s;pecially where Chri&s;tianity is concerned, you have &s;ometimes taken part with him): The &s;pectators of the combat gave the victory to the lady; the action is recorded in pure Engli&s;h; but if you plea&s;e to turn to the par|ticulars of the attack, which was on her &s;ide, you will find it conducted upon principles &s;o oppo&s;ite to your own, that you will probably differ in opinion from the re&s;t of mankind and give your palm to her antagoni&s;t: You I know would have proceeded according to all the rules of modern fine&s;&s;e; &s;apping, undermining and blowing up; working like a mole out of &s;ight, and over-turning all things in confu&s;ion and ruin; &s;he, in the &s;pirit of ancient times, carried on her ap|proaches in open day-light and above ground, com|bating with &s;uch weapons only, as <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> had put into her hands under the plain guidance and direction of her own wit and judgement. To this <HI>lady,</HI> in pure affection and e&s;teem, I had purpo&s;ed to have in&s;cribed this Comedy; but when you told me
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
it was not worthy even of my poor genius, how could I &s;uppo&s;e it a fit tribute to her's? She will therefore in the &s;imple phra&s;e accept the will for the deed; and if &s;he &s;hould chance upon refu&s;al to di&s;&s;ent from the opinion you have given in the ca&s;e, I mu&s;t be&s;eech her to di&s;tru&s;t her&s;elf, and to believe there is one quality, very apt to mi&s;lead and be mi&s;led, which &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in a greater degree (if po&s;&s;ible) than either wit or judgement, and that is called (pardon my introducing it into your pre&s;ence) <HI>Benevolence.</HI></P>
<P>How ridiculous &s;hould I have made my&s;elf, if, fol|lowing the fal&s;e lights of popular applau&s;e, I had pre|&s;ented this <HI>heterogeneous</HI> piece (as you are plea&s;ed to call it) to one, who&s;e genius might have merited the ori|ginal from whence it pretends to be derived; not the <HI>'Squire of Al&s;atia</HI> I mean, but the <HI>Adelphi of Terence:</HI> With re&s;pect to the above-mentioned <HI>'Squire,</HI> which I under&s;tand is the offspring of <HI>Mr. Shadwell,</HI> if I have ignorantly robb'd him of any part of his patrimony, I hope it will not be imputed to me; for I do &s;eriou&s;ly declare that to my knowledge I never &s;aw him, or ever had any commerce or acquaintance with him, or knew, 'till you informed me, that he had &s;o re&s;pecta|ble a father: It is to you therefore, <HI>ingenious Sir,</HI> I am indebted for the di&s;covery that I have lo&s;t &s;ight of an original which I pretended to have copied, and copied one which I really never &s;aw.</P>
<P>But I would beg leave humbly to ob&s;erve that the plot of <HI>Terence</HI> was never in my contemplation; it re|quires the genius of <HI>Mr. Ma&s;on</HI> to make the Grecian &s;implicity live on our &s;tage; I dare not attempt it even at your command; but if you wi&s;h to have it tried, go to your <HI>Terence,</HI> you will find it ingeniou&s;ly and ably tran&s;lated, and bring his <HI>Brother</HI> on the theatre; I fear even my illegitimate race, if tried by a jury of Engli&s;h freeholders, will ou&s;t the repre&s;entative of the heir apparent, nay the very heir him&s;elf, if he was to come in his own per&s;on to a&s;&s;ert his right.</P>
<P><HI>Atbens</HI> and <HI>London, Mo&s;t Mighty Sir,</HI> cannot as I conceive be ea&s;ily compared: In your department I am appri&s;ed how much advantage dwells with the latter; $n mine we are grievou&s;ly wor&s;ted: I have ventured
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
to hint to you in the dull <HI>prologue</HI> I have pre&s;in'd, that there were at lea&s;t fifty comic poets flouri&s;hing at one period in <HI>Athens,</HI> and mo&s;t of the&s;e lived to write more plays than all our fraternity now alive put to|gether; tho' you I believe may think &s;ome of us have already written more than enough. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Scrip&s;it</HI> (&s;c Menander) <HI>Suid&acirc; te&s;te</HI> 80 <HI>Comaedias, vel &s;ecundum alios</HI> 180, <HI>qui etiam a Terentio conver&s;as e&s;&s;e omne&s;q. intercidi&s;&s;e a&s;&s;erunt.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Menander, learn|ed Sir,</HI> you well know is &s;aid to have written 80, or according to &s;ome, 180 Comedies, and that they were all tran&s;lated by <HI>Terence;</HI> but if we take the te&s;timony of <NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ex i&s;tis tamen centum et quinque omnibus, folis eum (&s;c Menan|drum) octo vici&s;&s;e idem Apollodorus codem in libro &s;crip&s;it.</HI> A GILL. xvii. iv.</NOTE> <HI>Apollodorus,</HI> the number will amount according to his computation to 105, and the &s;ame authority tells us that out of the&s;e 105 Comedies, <HI>Menander</HI> carried away but eight prizes, while <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Euripidem quo&abque; M Varro ait, quum quinque et &s;eptuaginta tra|gaedias &s;crip&s;erit in quinque &s;olis vici&s;&s;e.</NOTE> <HI>Euripides,</HI> as <HI>Varro</HI> informs us, on the other hand, out of 75 Tragedies was victorious only in five. The&s;e in&s;tances will &s;uffice to give us &s;ome idea of the comparative &s;tate of genius in the two places and periods.</P>
<P>Among&s;t all the&s;e plays and all the&s;e poets, which the Athenian &s;tage can boa&s;t, I &s;hould doubt if you could have found half the employment which our &s;canty fraternity at home afford you: Be plea&s;ed, <HI>learned Sir,</HI> to try your &s;kill upon any one of <HI>Ari&s;to|phanes</HI>'s comedies; take his <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></NOTE> <HI>Clouds</HI> for in&s;tance; if you was literally in the clouds you could not be more to &s;eek; and unle&s;s Dr. <HI>John&s;on,</HI> or Mrs. <HI>Carter</HI> will take you by the hand (and how that &s;hould be I don't know) you will never get thro' the fog&mdash;Turn over a Fragment of <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Philemon lived in the time of Alexander the Great; he was a writer of the</HI> New Comedy, <HI>and is &s;aid by Suidas to have written ninety plays.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Philemon;</HI> what do you think of it?

<P>By this &s;pecimen of your acquaintance with the <HI>comic writers of antiquity, mo&s;t learned Sir,</HI> I &s;u&s;pect that from the great attention you have be&s;towed upon the moderns, you have had little to &s;pare to their pre|dece&s;&s;ors; for if it is your opinion that <HI>Terence</HI> of all the ancient comic poets made the <HI>neare&s;t approaches</HI> to the <HI>pathetic,</HI> I fear you will have an ho&s;t of authorities to combat? <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">To $thos <HI>nulli alii &s;ervare convenit quam Titinnio et Terentio;</HI> Pathe <HI>vero Trabea et Attilius et Caecilius facil&egrave; moverant.</HI> (Varr. de Lat.

But let us con&s;ider the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions of <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s; I do not di&s;cover any allu&s;ion to the <HI>pathetic:</HI> He calls him <HI>puri &s;ermonis amator;</HI> and this indeed accords with <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Quidquid come loquens ac omnia dulcia dicens.</NOTE> <HI>Cicero</HI>'s de&s;cription; but I am apt to think that neither in this expre&s;&s;ion, nor in that of <HI>Lenibus Scriptis</HI> any reference is made to the <HI>pathetic,</HI> and I am &s;trengthened in this opinion by an ob&s;ervation of <HI>Tanaquillus Faber</HI> on this very pa&s;|&s;age: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Nempe hoc &s;en$$bat Terentium in movendis</HI> pathefin <HI>inforiorem quibu&s;danm poet$s e&s;&s;e, quod profecto verum e&s;t, et judicium Cae&s;aris &s;en|tenti&acirc; Varronis, qui Romanorum docti&s;&s;imus fuit confirmatur.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Cae&s;ar thought</HI> (&s;ays the commentator) <HI>that Torence, in moving the pa&s;&s;ions, was inferior to &s;ome others, which indeed is the ca&s;e; and Cae&s;ar's opinion is confirmed by the decree of Varro, the mo&s;t learned of the Romans.</HI> This truly is to the point, if we are to cre|dit the authority above-mentioned; and he proceeds to &s;ay, <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vides</HI> to ethos <HI>Terentio relictum, nil aliud:</HI> To pathos, <HI>quod vim et impetum po&s;tulat, prae&s;erlim in genere comico, aliis concedi.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Thus you &s;ee that nothing is left to Terence but The Manners: The Pathetic, which requires force and energy, e&s;pecially in the comic province, is a&s;cribed to others.</HI> By this reference you &s;ee we have not only gained an authority for my interpretation of <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s words, but we have &s;ound a learned critic, who is
<PB N="xi" REF="10">
hardy enough to a&s;&s;ert, that the <HI>pathetic</HI> is the very effence of the <HI>vis comica,</HI> or in other words, <HI>requires force and energy, e&s;pecially</HI> in <HI>the comic province;</HI> the very oppo&s;ite doctrine to what you, <HI>mo&s;t learned Sir,</HI> have maintained.</P>
<P>So much for <HI>Terence;</HI> as for <HI>all the other Comic Writers of antiquity,</HI> I am at a lo&s;s to know whether you refer to the whole bulk of them in general, mean|ing all &s;uch of who&s;e writings we have any fragments or de&s;criptions; or whether you mean <HI>all the others,</HI> who&s;e plays have come down to us entire; or in other words, <HI>all the two,</HI> viz. <HI>Ari&s;tophanes</HI> and <HI>Plantus&mdash;</HI>But we will take a &s;hort examination of the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>If you mean to refer generally to the bulk of Greek and Roman writers of comedy, the que&s;tion is in part an&s;wer'd by <HI>Varro,</HI> (as above quoted) who declares that <HI>Trabea, Attilius</HI> and <HI>Caecilius</HI> excelled in <HI>&s;entimental</HI> or <HI>pathetic</HI> comedy: This will &s;atisfy us as to the Roman &s;tage; the Greek theatre, being original, was more various: Comedy took different characters at different periods: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vetus Comoedia.</NOTE> <HI>The Ancient Comedy</HI> was per&s;onal and licentious, for then the government of <HI>Athens</HI> was democratical; <HI>Ari&s;tophanes, Cratinus, Eupolis, Phere|crates,</HI> and many others rank under this department; they la&s;h'd the vices of mankind with &s;ingular &s;everity; the generals, judges, trea&s;urers, the people them&s;elves, nay the mo&s;t illu&s;trious and mo&s;t virtuous citizens were not exempt from their &s;atire. Their invectives however were frequently re&s;ented; <HI>Eupolis</HI> in par|ticular was ca&s;t into the &s;ea and drowned, either be|cau&s;e he had &s;atyriz'd the <HI>Baptae,</HI> in his comedy &s;o call'd, or at the command of <HI>Alcibiades,</HI> whom he had lampooned. This circum&s;tance and the tran&s;ition of power from the people to the nobles introduced that &s;pecies of comedy call'd <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Media.</NOTE> <HI>The Middle;</HI> of this &s;ort we are told was the <HI>Aeolo&s;icon</HI> of <HI>Ari&s;tophanes,</HI> the <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> of <HI>Cratinus,</HI> and many others, which contain no per&s;onal invective, but have for the object of their

<P>Not at all; beware how you apply French ideas to Engli&s;h merchants: Where nature be&s;tows genius, education will give accompli&s;hments; but where the di&s;po&s;ition is wanting, the blood of a Duche&s;s can|not make a gentlewoman.</P>

<P>Bi&s;hop, Madam! that per&s;on which you look up|on is a phy&s;ician, and the people round about him are his patients; they are in a de&s;perate way it mu&s;t be confe&s;t.
