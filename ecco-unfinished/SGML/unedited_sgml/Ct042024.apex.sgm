<HEAD>TO MR. GEORGE ROMNEY.</HEAD>
<P>WHILST you was engaged in contemplating tho&s;e wonderful productions of ancient art, which ITALY is enriched with, I was tracing the ruder beauties of Nature in a dome&s;tic tour thro' the mountainous parts of WESTMORELAND and CUMBERLAND: You carried out with you a di&s;intere&s;ted pa&s;&s;ion for your art, with faculties which this country hath rarely given birth to; and you return from your travels with &s;ome &s;pecimens of &s;o au&s;picious a &s;ort, that, when en|couragement &s;hall provoke your genius to its full di&s;play, we are per&s;wad|ed you will take rank with the fir&s;t ma&s;ters of the highe&s;t province and be&s;t age of painting: I &s;et out on my expedition with no other preten|&s;ions than a devout re&s;pect for Nature in her &s;ublime&s;t &s;hapes, and &s;ome &s;mall leanings towards the Mu&s;e; not enough to make our intercour&s;e the talk of po&s;terity, but barely &s;ufficient to fill up the hour. The fruit of my tour hath been, what I fear is &s;carce worth laying at your feet, the following Irregular Ode, which was literally &s;truck out on the &s;pot, and is addre&s;t to the Sun; for as the &s;ea&s;on was far advanced towards winter, we had frequent temptations to invoke that luminary, who was
<PB N="4" REF="3">
never very gracious to our &s;uit, except whil&s;t we were viewing the lake of KESWICK and its accompaniments.</P>
<P>If I &s;hould be a&s;ked why I give that to the world and you, which I really think &s;carce worthy the acceptance of you and the world, I have only to an&s;wer, that if the hone&s;t pride of the Friend did not draw it into public, the idle vanity of the Poet would be well content to &s;pare the the Pre&s;s its pains: but the gratification of &s;aying how much I re|&s;pect your genius and e&s;teem your virtues, finds it an ea&s;y ta&s;k to o|vercome the remon&s;trances of Judgement, or the terrors of critici&s;m.</P>
<P>Mr. GRAY, who&s;e faculty of de&s;cribing can give life to &s;cenes which I &s;hould have conceived nothing but the pencil could convey, hath left behind him a Journal, for which we are indebted to his can|did friend and editor. This Journal refers to all the &s;cenes hinted at in the following Ode; and being a book in every body's hands, makes it unnece&s;&s;ary for me to trouble the Reader with any attempts of my own by way of notes, which with the be&s;t poems &s;eldom ac|cord, and in my in&s;tance might have been a hazardous experiment.</P>
<P>How it came to pa&s;s, that this enchanting di&s;play of &s;ublime and beautiful objects could extort nothing more than a pro&s;aic de&s;cription from a poetical pen, I am at a lo&s;s to gue&s;s. I have been favoured with a
<PB N="5" REF="4">
Manu&s;cript of the late ingenious Dr. BROWNE, which I had the privi|ledge of in&s;erting in this publication, and &s;hould &s;o have done, but that I found it had already got forth into the world, and was in print: It is touched with great &s;pirit, and in a glowing &s;tile, which gradually kindles till it breaks forth into the following rhap&s;ody, which I believe hath hitherto e&s;caped publication:</P>
<LG>
<L>Now &s;unk the Sun, now Twilight &s;unk, and Night</L>
<L>Rode in her zenith; nor a pa&s;&s;ing breeze</L>
<L>Sigh'd to the groves, which in the midnight air</L>
<L>Stood motionle&s;s, and in the peaceful floods</L>
<L>Inverted hung: For now the billow &s;lept</L>
<L>Along the &s;hore, nor heav'd the deep, but &s;pread</L>
<L>A &s;hining mirror to the Moon's pale orb,</L>
<L>Which, dim and waining, o'er the &s;hadowy clifts,</L>
<L>The &s;olemn woods and &s;piry mountain-tops</L>
<L>Her glimmering faintne&s;s threw: Now every eye,</L>
<L>Oppre&s;s'd with toil, was drown'd in deep repo&s;e;</L>
<L>Save that the un&s;een &s;hepherd in his watch,</L>
<L>Propt on his crook, &s;tood li&s;t'ning by the fold,</L>
<L>And gaz'd the &s;tarry vault and pendant moon;</L>
<L>Nor voice nor &s;ound broke on the deep &s;erene,</L>
<L>But the &s;oft murmur of &s;wift-gu&s;hing rills,</L>
<L>Forth-i&s;&s;uing from the mountain's di&s;tant &s;teep,</L>
<L>(Unheard till now, and now &s;carce heard) proclaim'd</L>
<L>All things at re&s;t, and imag'd the &s;till voice</L>
<L>Of quiet whi&s;pering to the ear of Night.</L>

<P><PB N="6" REF="5">
In fine, <HI>&s;ays Dr. BROWNE,</HI> this accumulation of beauty and immen&s;ity tends not only to excite rapture but reverence; for my part I make an annual voyage to Ke&s;wick, not only as an innocent amu&s;ement, but a reli|gious act. I walk forth in this &s;tupendous &s;cene, as into the grande&s;t earth|ly temple of the Creator; and as I take my progre&s;s thro' its &s;everal parts, often break forth with the divine P&s;almi&s;t in that grateful exclamation&mdash;<Q>&startq;O LORD, how manifold are thy works; in wi&s;dom ha&s;t thou made them all.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>What I have here in&s;erted is taken from a letter to a friend, and is a valuable &s;pecimen of the author. As for the minute delineations, which &s;ome travellers affect to give of &s;cenes that come under their contem|plation, they &s;eldom convey to my apprehen&s;ion any map of the place they de&s;cribe. To you perhaps, who&s;e pictures are language, language may be a picture; and as I know you can paint our very words, words may in return paint that to you, of which a le&s;s intuitive mind takes no conception; the bulk of mankind however collect little from the&s;e de|&s;criptions but the amu&s;ement of reading them; and the mo&s;t they can effect is to refre&s;h the memories of them, who have been on the &s;pot, or to in&s;pire tho&s;e, who have not been, with a re&s;olution of going thither. And in truth a more plea&s;ing tour than the&s;e lakes hold out to men of lei&s;ure and curio&s;ity cannot be devi&s;ed. We penetrate the <HI>Glacieres,</HI> tra|ver&s;e the <HI>Rhone</HI> and the <HI>Rhine,</HI> whil&s;t our own dome&s;tic lakes of <HI>Ulswa|ter,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="6">
<HI>Ke&s;wick</HI> and <HI>Wyndermere</HI> exhibit &s;cenes in &s;o &s;ublime a &s;tile, with &s;uch beautiful colourings of rock, wood and water, backed with &s;o tre|mendous a di&s;po&s;ition of mountains, that if they do not fairly take the lead of all the views in Europe, yet they are indi&s;putably &s;uch as no Engli&s;h traveller &s;hould leave behind him, provided he be one, who, with my <HI>Atticus,</HI> loves</P>

<L>"To follow nature in her &s;imple haunts,</L>
<L>"With early &s;teps to climb the &s;haggy &s;ide</L>

<L>"Of morning, i&s;&s;uing from the flowery vale:</L>
<L>"Or &s;oft reclining on the mo&s;&s;y turf</L>

<P>But the views of our young travelling gentry, as you mu&s;t well know, are not thus directed: on the road they are couriers; in the cities they are revellers: Whil&s;t they are journeying there is no re&s;pite nor repo&s;e; their enquiries extend neither to right hand nor left, and &s;eldom fur|ther forward than to the next <HI>po&s;te;</HI> the &s;horte&s;t and &s;traighte&s;t road to di&s;&s;ipation and plea&s;ure is their's, all the re&s;t is out of the way: but if
<PB N="8" REF="7">
their cour&s;e &s;hould nece&s;&s;arily carry them up to any thing curious in na|ture, if their road &s;hould compel them to the banks of a torrent, or the brow of a mountain, they are a&s;leep, or it is dark night and they cannot &s;ee it, for they are in ha&s;te, and want to be at the next great noi&s;y town: And now begins the plan of all their operations; here they lay in their &s;tock of new cloathes, new ta&s;te and new opinions; in re|turn for which they barter away all their little fund of money, mode&s;ty and religion: Here they walk thro' palaces of pictures with as much edification as a boarding-&s;chool girl would thro' the Mu&s;eum, or an uphol&s;terer thro' the Vatican. They have been told of the <HI>gu&s;to</HI> of the <HI>antique,</HI> but where to find it, or how to di&s;tingui&s;h it, they know no more than their mothers: <HI>Virt&ugrave;</HI> however is to be purcha&s;ed, like other &s;uperfluities, and in the end their <HI>Cicerone</HI> lays them in for a bargain, perhaps a patch-work head of <HI>Trajan</HI> &s;et upon a modern pair of &s;houl|ders, and made up with <HI>Caracalla</HI>'s no&s;e and <HI>Nero</HI>'s ears,
<Q><L>Aut curios jam dimidios, humerove minorem</L>
<L>Corvinum, aut Galbam auriculis na&s;oque carentem.</L></Q></P>
<P>Thus equipt with the&s;e imperial reliques, with an veritable daubing of <HI>Raphaelle,</HI> copied from the very print which is given to prove its ori|ginality, and a huge <HI>cameo</HI> on the little finger, home they come privi|ledg'd <HI>Virtuo&s;i,</HI> qualified to condemn every thing that their own coun|trymen can produce; and thus having contributed all that in them lies

to di&s;grace their native land, they conclude their career by affecting to de&s;pi&s;e it. It is in vain that a native arti&s;t exhibits to their view the models of a <HI>Mars</HI> and a <HI>Venus,</HI> &s;uch as I am bold to &s;ay would have done credit to <HI>Athens</HI> in its pure&s;t age; they may <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is &s;uperfluous to &s;ay this points at Mr. <HI>Bacon;</HI> the reader of ta&s;te will be &s;or|ry to know that the&s;e beautiful models have brought nothing but reputation to their maker.</NOTE>moulder in his &s;hop for them, unle&s;s indeed they had lo&s;t a leg or an arm in the ruins of <HI>Hadri|an</HI>'s villa, and then they would purcha&s;e them at twice the co&s;t of the whole figures,
<Q><L>Miranturque nihil ni&s;i quod Libitina &s;acravit.</L></Q></P>
<P>I &s;hould be much mi&s;under&s;tood if this was not thought to be &s;aid with all due exceptions; much more, if I was &s;uppo&s;ed in&s;en&s;ible to the ge|neral u&s;es of travel: this would be only combating one prejudice with anothe$&punc; let both be ca&s;t a&s;ide and men and things con&s;idered in their true light: There are to be found (and may their numbers multiply!) protectors of living genius, who will admit the <HI>Orpheus</HI> of <HI>Danee</HI> and the <HI>Ugolino</HI> of <HI>Reynolds</HI> into their choice&s;t cabinets; and I tru&s;t there will be found, with whom your Graces will find an honourable &s;tation; for &s;ure it would be a very antipatriotic prejudice to admit the vulgar drabs of the Flemi&s;h, or the theatrical dames of the Italian arti&s;t, in
