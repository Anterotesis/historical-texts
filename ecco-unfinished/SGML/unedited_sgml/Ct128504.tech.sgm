<P>To You, MY DEAR FRIENDS, I beg
leave to in&s;cribe this little Mi&s;cellany. To
You its Author was well known: Ye were
plea&s;ed, even from his childhood, to inter|e&s;t
your&s;elves in his welfare: and towards
You, on account of your eminent virtues
and abilities, and of that unre&s;erved and
<PB N="vi" REF="6">
uninterrupted friend&s;hip with which he
knew Ye had, for more than Thirty years,
honoured his father, his Gratitude and Ve|neration
were peculiarly &s;trong. The&s;e are
the rea&s;ons which induce me to take the
liberty of addre&s;&s;ing You on the pre&s;ent
occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>OF my conduct in making this collec|tion
there is one circum&s;tance which may
&s;eem to need an apology; and that is, my
putting together in the &s;ame volume pieces
&s;o different in &s;tyle and character. I might
&s;ay, that many writers and editors have
done the &s;ame thing without incurring
blame. But I have another and perhaps
a better rea&s;on. I wi&s;hed to give &s;uch
proofs as could be had, and might be pub|li&s;hed,
of the various talents of the Au|thor;
and, for the &s;ake of the example, to
&s;how, that, though &s;tudious and learned,
<PB N="vii" REF="7">
he was neither au&s;tere nor formal; and
that in him the &s;tricte&s;t piety and mode&s;|ty
were united with the utmo&s;t chearful|ne&s;s,
and even playfulne&s;s, of di&s;po&s;ition.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE
AUTHOR's LIFE &amp; CHARACTER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATE>28. November 1790.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I INTEND to write a &s;hort account of the life, e|ducation,
and character, of my Son now decea&s;ed.
It will innocently, and perhaps not unprofitably,
amu&s;e &s;ome hours of this melancholy &s;ea&s;on, when
my mind can &s;ettle on nothing el&s;e; and, whether
it be publi&s;hed or not, a circum&s;tance on which
I have as yet formed no re&s;olution, it will be an
acceptable pre&s;ent to tho&s;e to whom I may &s;end it.
The account, though drawn up by the hand of a
friend, will not in any particular be erroneous. In
order to convey a favourable notion of the per|&s;on
of whom I &s;peak, I have nothing to do, but to
tell the &s;imple truth.</P>
<P>JAMES HAY BEATTIE was born in Aberdeen
the &s;ixth of November, in the year one thou&s;and
&s;even hundred and &s;ixty eight. He was baptized
by the name of <HI>James Hay,</HI> by permi&s;&s;ion of JAMES
HAY EARL OF ERROLL, who had patronized me at
<PB N="10" REF="9">
an early period of my life, and ever after honour|ed
me with his friend&s;hip: a nobleman, who, to
a competent knowledge of cla&s;&s;ical learning, and
other accompli&s;hments becoming his rank, joined
uncommon elegance, dignity, and affability of
manners; with benevolence unbounded; an ex|emplary
regard to the in&s;titutions of religion; and
a &s;pirit of true patrioti&s;m, whereof tho&s;e parts of
his country, with which he was connected, do &s;till
feel, and it is hoped will long feel, the &s;alutary in|fluence.</P>
<P>To parents, and other near relations, infancy is
very intere&s;ting; but can hardly &s;upply any thing
of narrative. My &s;on's was in no re&s;pect remark|able,
unle&s;s, perhaps, for a mildne&s;s and docility
of nature, which adhered to him through life. I
do not remember that I ever had occa&s;ion to re|prove
him above three or four times: bodily cha&s;|ti&s;ement
he never experienced at all. It would in|deed
have been mo&s;t unrea&s;onable to apply this
mode of di&s;cipline to one, who&s;e &s;upreme concern
it ever was to know his duty, and to do it.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t rules of morality I taught him were,
to &s;peak truth, and keep a &s;ecret; and I never
<PB N="11" REF="10">
found that in a &s;ingle in&s;tance he tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed ei|ther.</P>
<P>THE doctrines of religion I wi&s;hed to impre&s;s on
his mind, as &s;oon as it might be prepared to receive
them; but I did not &s;ee the propriety of making
him commit to memory theological &s;entences, or
any &s;entences, which it was not po&s;&s;ible for him
to under&s;tand. And I was de&s;irous to make a trial
how far his own rea&s;on could go in tracing out,
with a little direction, the great and fir&s;t principle
of all religion, the being of GOD. The follow|ing
fact is mentioned, not as a proof of &s;uperior
&s;agacity in him (for I have no doubt that mo&s;t
children would in like circum&s;tances think as he
did), but merely as a moral or logical experiment.</P>
<P>HE had reached his fifth [or &s;ixth] year, knew
the alphabet, and could read a little; but had
received no particular information with re&s;pect
to the Author of his being: becau&s;e I thought he
could not yet under&s;tand &s;uch information; and
becau&s;e I had learned from my own experience,
that to be made to repeat words not under&s;tood is
extremely detrimental to the faculties of a young
mind. In a corner of a little garden, without in|forming
<PB N="12" REF="11">
any per&s;on of the circum&s;tance, I wrote
in the mould, with my finger, the three initial let|ters
of his name; and, &s;owing garden cre&s;&s;es in
the furrows, covered up the &s;eed, and &s;moothed
the ground. Ten days after, he came running to
me, and with a&s;toni&s;hment in his countenance told
me, that his name was growing in the garden. I
laughed at the report, and &s;eemed inclined to di&s;|regard
it; but he in&s;i&s;ted on my going to &s;ee what
had happened. Yes, &s;aid I carele&s;sly, on coming
to the place, I &s;ee it is &s;o; but there is nothing in
this worth notice; it is mere chance: and I went
away. He followed me, and, taking hold of my
coat, &s;aid with &s;ome earne&s;tne&s;s, it could not be
mere chance; for that &s;ome body mu&s;t have con|trived
matters &s;o as to produce it.&mdash;I pretend not
to give his words, or my own, for I have forgot|ten
both; but I give the &s;ub&s;tance of what pa&s;&s;ed
between us in &s;uch language as we both under|&s;tood.&mdash;So
you think, I &s;aid, that what appears &s;o
regular as the letters of your name cannot be by
chance. Yes, &s;aid he, with firmne&s;s, I think &s;o.
Look at your&s;elf, I replied, and con&s;ider your
hands and fingers, your legs and feet, and other
limbs; are they not regular in their appearance,
and u&s;eful to you? He &s;aid, they were. Came you
<PB N="13" REF="12">
then hither, &s;aid I, by chance? No, he an&s;wered,
that cannot be; &s;omething mu&s;t have made me.
And who is that &s;omething, I a&s;ked. He &s;aid, he
did not know. (I took particular notice, that he
did not &s;ay, as Rou&s;&s;eau fancies a child in like cir|cum&s;tances
would &s;ay, that his parents made him.)
I had now gained the point I aimed at: and &s;aw,
that his rea&s;on taught him, (though he could not
&s;o expre&s;s it) that what begins to be mu&s;t have a
cau&s;e, and that what is formed with regularity
mu&s;t have an intelligent cau&s;e. I therefore told
him the name of the Great Being who made him
and all the world; concerning who&s;e adorable na|ture
I gave him &s;uch information as I thought he
could in &s;ome mea&s;ure comprehend. The le&s;&s;on
affected him greatly, and he never forgot either it,
or the circum&s;tance that introduced it.</P>
<P>AT home, from his Mother and me, he learned
to read and write. His pronunciation was not
correct, as may well be &s;uppo&s;ed: but it was de|liberate
and &s;ignificant, free from provincial pecu|liarities,
and &s;uch as an Engli&s;hman would have
under&s;tood; and afterwards, when he had pa&s;&s;ed
a few &s;ummers in England, it became more ele|gant
than what is commonly heard in North Bri|tain.
<PB N="14" REF="13">
He was early warned again&s;t the u&s;e of
Scotch words and other &s;imilar improprieties;
and his di&s;like to them was &s;uch, that he &s;oon
learned to avoid them; and, after he grew up,
could never endure to read what was written in
any of the vulgar dialects of Scotland. He look|ed
at Mr Allan Ram&s;ay's poems, but did not re|li&s;h
them. Whether the more original &s;trains of
Mr Burns ever came in his way, I do not certain|ly
know.</P>
<P>WHEN he had compleated his &s;eventh year, be|ing
now a good reader, a ready writer, and well
acquainted with the catechi&s;m publi&s;hed by the
pious and learned Dr Watts, I made him attend
the grammar &s;chool of Aberdeen; where, under
the in&s;pection of his grandfather Dr Dun and other
able ma&s;ters, he acquired, with facility and exact|ne&s;s,
the elements of the Latin tongue, and read
tho&s;e parts of the cla&s;&s;ick authors which are u&s;ual|ly
taught in our &s;chools. About the &s;ame time he
&s;tudied at home with me &s;ome of the be&s;t tales in
Ovid's Metamorpho&s;is, and &s;everal books of Vir|gil.
I was at particular pains to in&s;truct him in
certain niceties of the grammatical and critical
art, which are not found in the mo&s;t common
<PB N="15" REF="14">
grammars, and by little and little to initiate him
in the principles of univer&s;al or philo&s;ophical gram|mar.
This, he told me afterwards, was of great
u&s;e to him. Ovid did not much engage his atten|tion,
though he was well enough plea&s;ed with
Deucalion's deluge, Phaethon, Cadmus, Acteon and
his dogs; but it was ea&s;y to &s;ee, from the intere&s;t
he took in Virgil's narrative, and the empha&s;is
with which, of his own accord, he pronounced his
ver&s;es, that he was wonderfully affected with the
harmony and other excellencies of that poet. He
has told me &s;ince, that he then got by heart, &s;e|veral
entire books of the Eneid, and took great
delight in repeating them when at lei&s;ure and a|lone:
and he often, about this time, &s;poke with
peculiar complacency, of that de&s;cription of night,
in the fourth book (v. 522) which he &s;aid he fre|quently
recollected, in order to &s;ooth his mind,
when any trouble&s;ome thought occurred in the
night to di&s;compo&s;e him.</P>
<P>DRAWING he was early accu&s;tomed to, and at|tained
con&s;iderable proficiency in: but his other
avocations, and his being &s;ubject to headachs, pre|vented
his applying to it &s;o much as to become a
very great proficient. The theory of per&s;pective
<PB N="16" REF="15">
was familiar to him. In ludicrous <HI>caricatura</HI> he
had boundle&s;s invention.</P>
<P>KNOWING that his con&s;titution was very deli|cate,
and finding him inclined to &s;tudy rather too
much than too little, I was careful, in the fir&s;t
part, and indeed through the whole, of his life, not
only to caution him again&s;t immoderate &s;tudy,
by informing him of its dreadful con&s;equences;
but al&s;o to contrive for him &s;uch amu&s;ement as
would decoy him from his books, &s;trengthen his
body, and engage his mind. With this view, as
&s;oon as he could handle a &s;mall mu&s;quet, I put
him under the tuition of a &s;ergeant, who taught
him the military exerci&s;e. Not long after, I made
him attend an expert fencing ma&s;ter, till he became
very &s;kilful in the management of the &s;mall &s;word.
Archery, likewi&s;e, or &s;hooting with the long bow,
he practi&s;ed for years, and with good &s;ucce&s;s,
reading Roger A&s;cham on the &s;ubject; and ac|quiring
at the &s;ame time great dexterity in the u&s;e
of the &s;ling: and to the&s;e antient exerci&s;es he ad|ded
tho&s;e of fi&s;hing and fowling. With fire-arms
I did not tru&s;t him ra&s;hly; but he was to &s;uch a
degree attentive and con&s;iderate, that before his
fifteenth year I found him as worthy of that tru&s;t
<PB N="17" REF="16">
as any per&s;on could be. He laboured for &s;everal
weeks in endeavouring to learn to &s;wim, and had
at that time a companion who was completely
ma&s;ter of the art: but it appeared at la&s;t that the
chilne&s;s of the &s;ea-water did him more harm than
good.</P>
<P>THE exerci&s;e to which he &s;eemed to have the
&s;tronge&s;t di&s;inclination was dancing. By my ad|vice
he attended a ma&s;ter of it for many months,
and I believe made the u&s;ual progre&s;s; but, on
leaving that &s;chool, begged I would never de&s;ire
him to dance: a favour which I readily granted.
I know not whether he had adopted Cicero's
opinion<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Pro Muraena.</NOTE>, that no man dances who is not either
drunk or mad: but he told me, that to his habits
of thinking and feeling it was extremely incon|gruous,
being in mo&s;t particulars too finical, and
in every particular too o&s;tentatious.</P>
<P>HE left off fowling, when about the age of &s;e|venteen;
in his papers of that time I find hints of
his being not quite &s;atisfied of its lawfulne&s;s.
Fi&s;hing, however, he did not di&s;continue; he made
indeed a &s;tudy of it, or at lea&s;t of I&s;aak Walton's
<PB N="18" REF="17">
very ingenious and entertaining book on that &s;ub|ject:
for he thought there could be no &s;in in do|ing
what was practi&s;ed, or countenanced, by the
fir&s;t teachers of Chri&s;tianity. Tho&s;e &s;orts of it he
never engaged in, which give great pain, or pro|tract
the &s;ufferings of the poor animal. In all the
little manufactures of the angler he was complete|ly
&s;killed; as well as in all the arts of the fowler,
even to the training of a &s;etting dog. This, with ma|ny
other trifling particulars (as &s;ome would think
them) I mention, that the reader may &s;ee, it was
not my purpo&s;e to force him, by too rapid a pro|gre&s;s,
from childhood into premature manhood;
which I have &s;een attempted by well-meaning pa|rents,
but never with de&s;irable &s;ucce&s;s: I wi&s;hed
him to prepare him&s;elf, in early youth, by little
and little, for acting the part of a man; but, in the
meantime, not to forget that he was a boy.</P>
<P>AT the age of thirteen, having pa&s;&s;ed through
the forms of the grammar &s;chool, giving the ut|mo&s;t
&s;atisfaction to all his ma&s;ters, he was entered
a &s;tudent in Mari&s;chal college. The fir&s;t, or <HI>Greek,</HI>
cla&s;s, as it is called, he attended two years; as I
was anxious that he &s;hould be a proficient in that
noble language, which is every where too much
<PB N="19" REF="18">
neglected: &s;o that, as a &s;tudent of languages,
mathematicks, and philo&s;ophy, he attended col|lege
five years: a year more than is u&s;ually
thought nece&s;&s;ary in Scotland, or at lea&s;t in the
univer&s;ity of Mari&s;chal college, to qualify one for
the fir&s;t Academical degree, of Ma&s;ter of Arts.
He &s;tudied Greek under Mr Profe&s;&s;or Stuart;
Natural and Civil hi&s;tory under Dr Skene; Na|tural
Philo&s;ophy under Mr Profe&s;&s;or Copland;
Mathematicks, under Dr Hamilton; Chemi&s;try
under Dr French; and Moral Philo&s;ophy, Logick,
and Rhetorick, under my care. In all the &s;cien|ces,
his proficiency was &s;o great, that the fonde&s;t
and mo&s;t ambitious parent could not have wi&s;h|ed
it greater: and his whole behaviour, at &s;chool
and college, was not only irreproachable, but ex|emplary.
He was admitted to the degree of ma&s;|ter
of arts in April 1786.</P>
<P>ABOUT this time, the Botanical and other writ|ings
of Linneus caught his attention, and he &s;tu|died
them with great a&s;&s;iduity and delight; being
much a&s;&s;i&s;ted in that &s;tudy by his and my learn|ed
friends Dr Campbell Principal of Mari&s;chall
college, and Dr Laing mini&s;ter of the church-of-England
congregation at Peterhead. Theology al|&s;o
<PB N="20" REF="19">
he &s;tudied under the care of Dr Campbell and
Dr Gerard. But this was not the commencement
of his theological pur&s;uits; for from his early
youth he had &s;tudied the Holy Scriptures, which
he ju&s;tly thought to contain the only infallible
&s;y&s;tem of Chri&s;tian faith. When he went from
home, if he meant to be ab&s;ent a few weeks or
days, he took with him a pocket Bible and the
Greek New Te&s;tament: and among his papers I
find a little book of Remarks on the Hebrew gram|mar;
from which it appears he had made progre&s;s
in that language.</P>
<P>ON the fourth of June one thou&s;and &s;even hun|dred
and eighty &s;even, His Maje&s;ty, upon the re|commendation
of the univer&s;ity of Mari&s;chal col|lege,
was plea&s;ed to appoint him A&s;&s;i&s;tant Pro|fe&s;&s;or
of Moral Philo&s;ophy and Logick. His age
was then not quite nineteen; but to the gentle|men
of the univer&s;ity his character was &s;o well
known, that they mo&s;t readily, as well as unani|mou&s;ly,
concurred in the recommendation. It
may be thought, that I cho&s;e for him this way of
life; and indeed I did &s;o: but not till after he
had given me the mo&s;t explicit a&s;&s;urance, that he
preferred it to every other. When I told him,
<PB N="21" REF="20">
that in this &s;tation he might be very u&s;eful, but
could never be rich; his an&s;wer was, that he had
never wi&s;hed to be rich, and that to be u&s;eful was his
highe&s;t ambition. His fondne&s;s for an academi|cal
life I had long ob&s;erved: and, although I knew
him &s;ufficiently qualified to be a profe&s;&s;or of any
of the &s;ciences u&s;ually taught in univer&s;ities, ex|cept
Law and Phy&s;ick, (in both which, however,
he had made con&s;iderable progre&s;s) I &s;aw, with no
little &s;atisfaction, that moral philo&s;ophy, and the
&s;ciences allied to it, were the mo&s;t congenial to his
talents and character.</P>
<P>ON being inducted into his office he thought it
his duty to lay for &s;ome time other &s;tudies a&s;ide,
and apply him&s;elf, &s;olely or chiefly, to what he
thought might be the bu&s;ine&s;s of his life. This,
con&s;idering what he had already acquired of the
moral &s;ciences, I knew to be unnece&s;&s;ary, and told
him &s;o; de&s;iring him to amu&s;e him&s;elf with light|er
&s;tudies, till his bodily con&s;titution &s;hould be
more firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed. He followed my advice;
but at &s;pare hours read the be&s;t writers on the
ab&s;tract philo&s;ophy, particularly Dr Reid, Dr
Campbell, Bi&s;hop Butler, Dr Clarke, and Mr Bax|ter
author of an excellent treati&s;e on the incorpo|real
<PB N="22" REF="21">
nature of the human &s;oul. When I a&s;ked
whether he under&s;tood Baxter, and Butler, and
Clarke's demon&s;tration <HI>a priori</HI> of the Divine Ex|i&s;tence,
telling him that I had formerly thought
them not a little ab&s;tru&s;e, he &s;aid he was not &s;en|&s;ible
of their ab&s;tru&s;ene&s;s; for that to the &s;ame
modes of thinking he had been accu&s;tomed for &s;e|veral
years: and I found by his conver&s;ation, and
have &s;ince found more particularly by the papers
he has left, that he under&s;tood them perfectly.</P>
<P>HE had before this time acquired the elements
of mu&s;ical performance: I advi&s;ed him now to
apply to it with a&s;&s;iduity; knowing, by my own
experience, that after the fatigue of &s;tudy it might
be an innocent and u&s;eful recreation. He did
&s;o; and learned to perform with good expre&s;&s;ion
upon the organ and violin; &s;tudying at the &s;ame
time the theory of the art, in the works of Pa&s;|quali
and Holden; and, that he might &s;ee the the|ory
exemplified, peru&s;ing, with his wonted accu|racy,
&s;ome of the more elegant and affecting com|po&s;itions
of Handel, Corelli, Geminiani, Avi&s;on,
and Jack&s;on. The&s;e were the mu&s;ical authors
who &s;tood highe&s;t in his e&s;teem. The mu&s;ick ju&s;t
now in vogue had no charms for him: he &s;aid
<PB N="23" REF="22">
it wanted &s;implicity, pathos, and harmony; and
in the execution depended &s;o much on rapidity of
finger, or what may be called &s;light of hand, that
practitioners mu&s;t throw away more time than he
could &s;pare, before they could acquire any dexte|rity
in it. He was delighted with the &s;weet and
cla&s;&s;ical correctne&s;s of Corelli; and with the af|fecting
melodies of Jack&s;on, &s;o well adapted to the
words that accompany them: but the variety and
&s;ublimity of Handel's invention filled him with
rapture and a&s;toni&s;hment. He thought him the
Shak&s;peare of mu&s;ick, or rather the Shak&s;peare and
Milton united; and many of his &s;impler &s;ongs he
could &s;ing very agreeably, enforcing their expre&s;|&s;ion
with a thorough ba&s;e on the organ. He was
plea&s;ed too with &s;ome of the antient Scotch and
Welch airs; but made no account of the quick
jigging Scotch tunes, though he did not think
them all equally bad. He &s;eemed to con&s;ider the
frequent performance of the&s;e as having the &s;ame
tendency to deba&s;e a mu&s;ical ear, which the ha|bitual
u&s;e of a barbarous or provincial dialect has
in corrupting one's ta&s;te in language and &s;tile.
He had &s;tudied <HI>counterpoint</HI> and was profoundly
&s;killed in it; I find among his papers a great deal
written on that &s;ubject; and I have &s;een fugues
<PB N="24" REF="23">
of his contrivance which would not have di&s;cre|dited
a more experienced mu&s;ician. When I a&s;k|ed
what made him think of &s;tudying the theory
as well as practice of mu&s;ick, he &s;aid, that, as it
was impo&s;&s;ible, without knowing pro&s;ody, and the
laws of ver&s;ification, to have a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the
harmony of Homer and Virgil, &s;o he thought he
could not be &s;uitably affected with mu&s;ical har|mony,
if he did not under&s;tand the principles on
which it is con&s;tructed.&mdash;I &s;hall only add, with
re&s;pect to mu&s;ick, that, though I recommended it
to him, I would by no means do &s;o to all indi&s;|criminately.
To &s;uch young per&s;ons as are in a|ny
degree o&s;tentatious, or inclined, more than they
ought to be, to amu&s;ement and company, I think
it a dangerous &s;tudy. I have known &s;everal young
men, of tho&s;e characters, led by their love of mu|&s;ick
into bad company, and thence into idlene&s;s,
intemperance, and ruin. Catch-clubs, as they are
called, I believe to be particularly dangerous.</P>
<P>THOUGH my Son was now my a&s;&s;i&s;tant and col|league,
it was not my intention to devolve upon
him any of the duties of my office; tho&s;e except|ed
for which I might be di&s;qualified by bad health.
For I had long taken plea&s;ure in the employment;
<PB N="25" REF="24">
and I wi&s;hed him to be a little further advanced in
life, before he &s;hould be engaged in the more la|borious
parts of it. My health, however, during
the winter 1787-88 was in &s;uch a &s;tate, that re|covery
&s;eemed doubtful; and he was obliged,
&s;ooner than I wi&s;hed, to give proof of ability in
his profe&s;&s;ion. In this re&s;pect he acquitted him|&s;elf,
as in all others. His &s;teadine&s;s, good-nature,
and command of temper, &s;ecured his authority as
a teacher; and by his pre&s;ence of mind, and ready
recollection, he &s;atisfied his audience, that, though
young, he was abundantly qualified to in&s;truct
them. The talents that form a publick &s;peaker he
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in an eminent degree. As he could not
allow him&s;elf to &s;tudy any thing &s;uperficially, all
his knowledge was accurate, and in his memory
&s;o well arranged, that he was never at a lo&s;s; his
language per&s;picuous and correct, flowing ea&s;ily,
without he&s;itation, hurry, or apparent effort; his
voice di&s;tinct and manly; his manner never de|clamatory,
or o&s;tentatious, but &s;imple, conci&s;e, and
to the purpo&s;e: and he was at all times &s;ingular|ly
happy in recollecting familiar examples to il|lu&s;trate
his &s;ubject. In this la&s;t re&s;pect; I mean
in pa&s;&s;ing in&s;tantaneou&s;ly from one thought or i|mage
to another that was <HI>like it;</HI> he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch
<PB N="26" REF="25">
exuberance and correctne&s;s of fancy, e&s;pecially in
familiar conver&s;ation, that I have often thought,
if he had been ambitious to appear in the world
as a <HI>man of wit,</HI> that he would not have met with
many &s;uperiors. But he had no &s;uch ambition:
he would amu&s;e him&s;elf in this way, to divert me,
or any other intimate friend; but could not bear
to draw upon him&s;elf publick notice.</P>
<P>IN general company, indeed, he was (though
not awkward) mode&s;t to a degree that bordered
on ba&s;hfulne&s;s; and &s;o &s;ilent, that &s;ome people
would have thought him inattentive. But noth|ing
e&s;caped his ob&s;ervation; though what he had
ob&s;erved he never applied to any improper pur|po&s;e.
And I have known, not any other per&s;on
of his, and very few per&s;ons of any, age, who with
&s;o penetrating an eye di&s;cerned the characters of
men. I, who knew his opinions on all &s;ubjects,
do not remember any in&s;tance of his being in this
re&s;pect mi&s;taken. Yet &s;o careful was he to avoid
giving offence, that none, but a few of his mo&s;t
intimate friends, knew that he had &s;uch a talent.&mdash;I
know not whether I ought to mention, that
in what is called Mimickry he exceeded almo&s;t
every other per&s;on I have known. But my advice
<PB N="27" REF="26">
was not nece&s;&s;ary to prevent his cultivating that
art. On the &s;tage it may have its u&s;e; but in pri|vate
life he knew how improper it is, and how
dangerous; and of his own accord left it off en|tirely,
with my hearty approbation.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH with a few minutes of preparation
and a few written notes, (as he wrote &s;hort hand
with the utmo&s;t readine&s;s) he could qualify him&s;elf
&s;ufficiently for giving an hour's lecture on mo&s;t to|picks
that occur in Moral Philo&s;ophy and Logick,
yet he wi&s;hed to comprehend the whole cour&s;e in
a &s;eries of written prelections. The compo&s;ing of
the&s;e would, he rightly thought, make him ma&s;|ter
of his bu&s;ine&s;s; and to the&s;e, when they were
compo&s;ed, he could tru&s;t as a provi&s;ion, if bad
health &s;hould at any time render him unequal to
the effort of lecturing extempore. But of this plan
he did not live to execute the tenth part. Some of
the prelections he has left in writing may perhaps
at one time or other be laid before the publick.</P>
<P>To make the young &s;cholar perform exerci&s;es
in Latin ver&s;e, is not now cu&s;tomary, &s;o far as I
know, in any of the &s;chools of North Britain:
which I have long thought a deficiency in our
<PB N="28" REF="27">
di&s;cipline. I wi&s;hed him to attempt this mode of
compo&s;ition, re&s;olving however not to urge it, if
he &s;hould find it difficult. Accordingly, as &s;oon
as I knew him to be &s;ufficiently ma&s;ter of antient
pro&s;ody, I advi&s;ed him to write Latin ver&s;es. He
&s;aid, he did not think he could do it, but that,
&s;ince I de&s;ired it, he would make a trial, provided
I gave him a &s;ubject. A lob&s;ter happening to be on
the table, I propo&s;ed that as the argument of his
fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay: and next day he brought me four hex|ameters,
which, con&s;idering his age and inexpe|rience
(for he was then only fourteen), I thought
tolerable; and I encouraged him to make further
trials, when he &s;hould find him&s;elf in the humour
and at lei&s;ure. He continued from time to time
to amu&s;e him&s;elf in this way, and &s;oon acquired
a facility in it. He found it, he &s;aid, of the great|e&s;t
advantage in giving him a ready command of
Latin phra&s;eology; by obliging him to think in
that language, and to revolve in his mind a vari|ety
of &s;ynonymous expre&s;&s;ions, while in que&s;t of
that which would &s;uit the mea&s;ure and &s;ound of
his ver&s;e. It mu&s;t not be imagined that he lo&s;t
much time in this &s;tudy. He applied to it very
&s;eldom, and when he had nothing el&s;e to do, and
never, for &s;o I advi&s;ed, above half an hour in one
<PB N="29" REF="28">
day. Being urged by me to declare how much
he might do in that half hour, he owned, with a
mode&s;t reluctance natural to him on &s;uch occa|&s;ions,
that in half an hour he would &s;ometimes
compo&s;e from ten to fifteen or twenty lines. Were
all the half hours he ever employed in this exer|ci&s;e
to be thrown into one &s;um, they would not a|mount
to fourteen days.</P>
<P>AMONG his Latin compo&s;itions, I find one or
two original odes, and &s;ome epi&s;tles in imitation
of Horace<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The mo&s;t humourous, and one of the longe&s;t, of his poetical e&s;&s;ays, is a Latin epi&s;tle, (in imitation of Horace) giving a de&s;cription of a publick entertainment: but to private characters, though it is not &s;atirical, it has &s;o many allu&s;ions, that I &s;uppre&s;s it, as I know he him&s;elf would have done.</NOTE>; and tran&s;lations of &s;everal favourite
Engli&s;h &s;ongs, of &s;ome detached &s;tanzas from the
<HI>Ca&s;tle of Indolence,</HI> and of &s;ome parts of the <HI>Min&s;trel.</HI>
Whether he purpo&s;ed to make a complete ver&s;ion
of this la&s;t poem, I know not: his partiality to it
was no doubt exce&s;&s;ive; which the good-natured
reader will pardon.</P>
<P>IN November 1786 he tran&s;lated into Latin ver&s;e
Pope's <HI>Elegy</HI> on an unfortunate lady, and the
<PB N="30" REF="29">
<HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> of the &s;ame poet. The former was print|ed,
but without a name; the latter never received
his la&s;t emendations. In both the&s;e pieces, as
well as in the ver&s;ion of <HI>Sir Balaam,</HI> the tran&s;lation
has the &s;ame number of lines with the original.
His notions of tran&s;lation were as &s;trict as tho&s;e
of Horace<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">It is &s;trange that the pa&s;&s;age of Horace here alluded to (Epi&s;t. ad Pi&s;on. v. 133) &s;hould have been &s;o generally under&s;tood to mean ju&s;t the contrary of what the poet intended; as if he had been there lay|ing down rules for <HI>tran&s;lation,</HI> and di&s;approving of literal or clo&s;e tran&s;lations. The meaning of tho&s;e words, <HI>Nec verbum verbo cu|rabis reddere fidus Interpres,</HI> viewed in their connection with what immediately goes before and follows, is this: &startq;It is difficult and hazardous to invent new fables and characters; and a drama|tick poet may do better to take the &s;ubject of his piece from Ho|mer, than to make the whole of it new. But, in doing this, that he may not incur the blame of exhibiting as his own what be|longs to another, he mu&s;t be careful, fir&s;t, not to make his fable exactly the &s;ame with that of the original author; &s;econdly, not tran&s;late his words <HI>literally, as a faithful interpreter would do;</HI> and la&s;tly, to conduct his play according to the genius not of e|pick but of tragick compo&s;ition.&endq;&mdash;Terence was not a&s;hamed of having tran&s;lated literally: (See Prolog. ad Adelph.) and they who are acquainted with that author will not &s;uppo&s;e, either that his tran&s;lations were inelegant; or that they would have been more elegant if they had been le&s;s literal.</NOTE>; he thought it &s;hould be as literal as
the genius of the language into which it is made
<PB N="31" REF="30">
will permit; and that, as clo&s;ely as po&s;&s;ible, it
&s;hould imitate the &s;pirit, e&s;pecially the &s;implicity
and conci&s;ene&s;s, and (if poetical) the harmony, of
the original. Of paraphra&s;tical, or, as they have
been called, <HI>free</HI> tran&s;lations, he did not approve.
He thought the <HI>freedom</HI> of &s;uch interpreters might
be occa&s;ioned rather by want of critical &s;kill in
their own or their author's language, than by cor|rectne&s;s
of ta&s;te or luxuriancy of genius: at any
rate, whether meant to conceal ignorance, or im|prove
the original author, he thought that &s;uch
ver&s;ions were mi&s;repre&s;entations, and therefore
unju&s;tifiable. On this principle he mu&s;t have con|demned
&s;ome juvenile attempts of mine: but I
have rea&s;on to think he never &s;aw them; and I
was too much a&s;hamed of them to direct his at|tention
that way.</P>
<P>THE poetical tran&s;lation he admired mo&s;t was
Dob&s;on's <HI>Paradi&s;us Ami&s;&s;us;</HI> which is indeed more
exact, more &s;pirited, more elegant, and more like
its original, than any other I have &s;een: I cannot
account for its being &s;o much neglected; a judi|cious
&s;election of pa&s;&s;ages from it would be a mo&s;t
u&s;eful &s;chool book. He al&s;o e&s;teemed very highly
<PB N="32" REF="31">
Mr Potter's tran&s;lations of the Greek tragedies<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The following remark, which I find in one of his letters to me, may de&s;erve attention. &startq;I have read nothing &s;ince you left us, but Mr Potter's Tran&s;lation of Sophocles. The work di&s;|plays learning, indu&s;try, and genius; and yet it may be doubt|ed whether it will be popular. In &s;ome places, from <HI>too clo&s;e</HI> an adherence to the original, it almo&s;t provokes a &s;mile. When we read the ancient tragedies in their original language, great allow|ance is made for the &s;imple manners, and for the cu&s;toms, &s;uper|&s;titions, and ignorance of tho&s;e who wrote them. Such too is the harmony of the Greek tongue, and &s;uch the dignity it acquires in our e&s;timation, by never appearing in common u&s;e, that its very &s;ound will &s;ometimes divert our attention from the feeble|ne&s;s of the &s;entiment it expre&s;&s;es. But, when we read an Eng|li&s;h tran&s;lation, we lo&s;e the la&s;t advantage totally, and the former circum&s;tances we are apt to overlook. <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> might pa&s;s very well in a poet of Ionia: yet one is tempted to &s;mile at this &s;olemn prayer of the chorus, near the end of the <HI>Edipus at Co|lonus,</HI>

It would have been better to have retained the proper name <HI>Cer|berus,</HI> which has nothing ludicrous in the &s;ound.</NOTE>.
In the Virgil of Dryden he owned there were good
lines; but was di&s;gu&s;ted with that tran&s;lator's in|attention,
<PB N="33" REF="32">
in too many places, to the &s;en&s;e, and &s;till
more con&s;picuous inattention, to the &s;pirit, of his
original. Of Pope's Homer he may have read
parts, but never I think went through the whole.
He thought it a plea&s;ing Engli&s;h Poem, but by no
means a faithful exhibition of the genius of Ho|mer.
On his own attempts in tran&s;lation he &s;et
no value. He engaged in them as exerci&s;es mere|ly,
for improving him&s;elf, or amu&s;ing me; and
when he had put them in my hand, and heard
what I thought of them, which I own was always
favourable, he commonly left them with me, and
made no further inquiry about them. The ver|&s;ion
of Pope's Unfortunate Lady was printed by
my de&s;ire, and almo&s;t again&s;t his will: it was ne|ver
publi&s;hed; but I &s;ent copies of it to &s;ome of
our Friends.</P>
<P>THE reader has &s;een my motive for recommend|ing
as an exerci&s;e the compo&s;ition of Latin ver&s;es.
I had not the &s;ame rea&s;on for wi&s;hing him to en|gage
in Engli&s;h poetry. And I had known in|&s;tances
of young men mi&s;taking the talent of writ|ing
&s;mooth ver&s;es (a talent which may be ea&s;ily
acquired) for poetical genius; and thence follow|ing
that idle trade to their own great di&s;advan|tage.
<PB N="34" REF="33">
I had therefore determined, in ca&s;e of his
attempting it, to di&s;&s;uade the attempt, if I did not
&s;ee in his fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays undoubted indications of po|etical
invention, with numbers animated, and va|ried
according to the &s;ubject: and &s;uch di&s;&s;ua&s;ion
from me I knew <HI>he</HI> would receive with thankful|ne&s;s,
and without being either di&s;heartened or of|fended.</P>
<P>AMONG his Latin Poems, there is an Alcaick or
Horatian ode on Peterhead, which at my de&s;ire
he tran&s;lated into Engli&s;h ver&s;e. It contains an
elegant though brief account of the &s;cenery and
&s;ociety which he met with in that town and neigh|bourhood.
He had an attachment to Peterhead,
and wi&s;hed to pa&s;s part of every &s;ummer there;
in which I was always willing to indulge him.
The cau&s;es of this attachment were neither few
nor trivial. The air of the place had &s;everal times
re&s;tored his health, when it was declining: the
kind attentions &s;hown him by the better &s;ort of the
people, and their mode&s;t and &s;imple manners, had
won his heart: and the &s;ituation of the town, al|mo&s;t
&s;urrounded by the &s;ea, and in the neighbour|hood
of a plea&s;ant river and of &s;ome of the fine&s;t
downs in Great Britain, was very favourable to
<PB N="35" REF="34">
fi&s;hing, rowing, archery, &s;hooting, walking, and
other exerci&s;es in which he delighted. Here, too,
he had the company and conver&s;ation of our learn|ed
and pious Friend the reverend Doctor William
Laing; who loved him with great affection; taught
him many things relating to phy&s;ick, botany, me|chanicks,
mu&s;ick, &amp;c.; and took a particular plea|&s;ure
in devi&s;ing expedients to amu&s;e him<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">As an evidence of this gentleman's attachment, I take the li|berty to quote the following pa&s;&s;age from a letter which he &s;ent me a few weeks after my &s;on's death. &startq;As to any memorials of my dear Friend, I have no need of them for keeping up the re|membrance of him. There is not a corner in my hou&s;e, where I do not find his handwriting intermixed with mine: there is not an article of any &s;tudy or &s;cience that I can think on, where I do not find his &s;entiments and mine embodied together, and in regard to which I do not immediately think what he would have &s;aid upon the &s;ubject. And not only do I find him every where within the hou&s;e; but al&s;o, when I go into the fields, there is not a &s;pot of ground that does not remind me of him: nay, I no &s;ooner fix my attention upon any plant, than it brings into my mind when and where we fir&s;t &s;ettled its <HI>genus</HI> and <HI>&s;pecies.</HI> How I &s;hall be able to bear the view of our &s;um|mer haunts and walks without his company, if it &s;hall plea&s;e God to &s;pare me to &s;ee them, I do not yet know; but the thought of it is at pre&s;ent very painful to me.&endq;</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="35">
ONE of the greate&s;t attempts he ever made in
poetry was a didactick poem in Engli&s;h, on the ex|cellency
of the Chri&s;tian religion, and its peculiar
efficacy in improving and perfecting the human
&s;oul. He meant, if I mi&s;take not, to extend it to
three books; the fir&s;t of which, con&s;i&s;ting of about
&s;ix hundred lines, had been &s;ketched out before I
heard of it. This was, I believe, his fir&s;t <HI>&s;erious</HI>
effort in Engli&s;h ver&s;e. I was much plea&s;ed with
the &s;entiments, and, I own, not a little &s;urpri&s;ed
(con&s;idering the author's age) at the energy of ex|pre&s;&s;ion,
vivacity of de&s;cription, and appo&s;ite va|riety
of numbers, that appeared in &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages.
On the whole I was &s;atisfied, that he had a poeti|cal
genius; which, when matured by years, and
improved by practice, might, I fondly thought,
produce &s;omething con&s;iderable. But diffident of
my own opinion, which in a ca&s;e of this kind
might naturally enough be liable to undue influ|ence,
I &s;howed it to &s;ome Friends; who I thought
would be more impartial, as they were more com|petent,
judges. They were plea&s;ed to think of it
even more highly than I did, and gave him eve|ry
encouragement to per&s;evere. His ab&s;ence, how|ever,
from home, and various avocations, cau&s;ed
a long intermi&s;&s;ion of the work: and, when tho&s;e
<PB N="37" REF="36">
difficulties were removed, his anxiety to prepare
him&s;elf for a right di&s;charge of his duty as a pro|fe&s;&s;or,
determined him to lay a&s;ide for &s;ome time this
favourite project; and I heard nothing of it for a
great while. About a year before his death, I a&s;k|ed
him what was become of it. He &s;aid, that, as
&s;oon as he had di&s;engaged him&s;elf from his pre|&s;ent
cour&s;e of &s;tudy, he intended to re&s;ume, and,
if po&s;&s;ible, to fini&s;h it, and that he had it much at
heart to do &s;o: &startq;but,&endq; continued he, &startq;I &s;hall
make material alterations in the plan, and I be|lieve
there is hardly a line that will not under|go
correction.&endq; When, after his death, I called
to mind this circum&s;tance, and found, on in&s;pect|ing
his papers, that no alteration had been made,
(the rea&s;on of which will pre&s;ently appear) I was
at fir&s;t inclined, in ju&s;tice to his memory, to &s;up|pre&s;s
the whole. It was, however, &s;ugge&s;ted, that
this would be rather injurious to his memory:
that it was right it &s;hould be known that he had
&s;uch a de&s;ign, and had formed &s;uch a plan: that
extracts from the poem would throw light on his
character, and do honour both to his heart and to
his under&s;tanding: and that there was no rea&s;on
to fear, that the &s;everity of critici&s;m would ever
be exerted again&s;t a performance, written (ha&s;tily,
<PB N="38" REF="37">
I believe, though with a benevolent purpo&s;e) at
the age of &s;eventeen, and of which the author's
&s;ub&s;equent &s;tudies and early death had prevented
even the revi&s;al.</P>
<P>OF his ludicrous ver&s;es (the greater part of which
will never appear) I have little to &s;ay, but that
mo&s;t of them were written for my amu&s;ement,
though few by my de&s;ire, and all with &s;urpri&s;ing
facility. I &s;hall give one example. While he and
I were talking one evening of the humourous
Engli&s;h ballad that begins with the&s;e words &startq;Di|ogenes
&s;urly and proud&endq; &amp;c.; in which, from
peculiarities in the lives and doctrines of the an|tient
philo&s;ophers, it is proved, by ironical argu|ments,
that they mu&s;t all have been addicted to
drinking; I happened to &s;ay, it was pity our mo|dern
&s;ages were not in the &s;ame way celebrated
in a &s;econd part. Two days after he brought me
the &s;tanzas that have the name of <HI>The modern tip|pling
Philo&s;ophers;</HI> in which the &s;pirit of the old
ballad &s;eems to be &s;upported with equal humour,
and certainly not inferiour learning.</P>
<P>WHEN a &s;cheme was in agitation, in the year
1786, for uniting into one the two univer&s;ities of
<PB N="39" REF="38">
Aberdeen, his playful mu&s;e was not idle; but pro|duced
many humourous papers in Latin and Eng|li&s;h,
in pro&s;e and ver&s;e; which, however, no per|&s;on
but he and I ever &s;aw. All the&s;e I have &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed;
becau&s;e it was his opinion, as well as
mine, that what pa&s;&s;ed on that occa&s;ion, between
the two &s;ocieties, &s;hould as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible be for|gotten.
We both approved of the plan of union,
as thinking it would be highly beneficial to learn|ing;
but neither ever put him&s;elf in a pa&s;&s;ion up|on
the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>OBSERVING, early in the year 1788, that his
health had &s;uffered from the fatigues of the win|ter,
and much more, I believe, from anxiety on
account of my illne&s;s; and knowing, that he had
a genius in mechanicks, and was ma&s;ter of the
theory of organ-building; I propo&s;ed, that he
&s;hould pa&s;s the en&s;uing &s;ummer at Peterhead, and
there, with Dr Laing's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;uperinted the
building of an organ for him&s;elf. This was in
due time executed. The work employed him a|bout
five months; and the amu&s;ement he derived
from it, and the mu&s;ick with which it afterwards
&s;upplied him, had the happie&s;t effects on his con|&s;titution.
And, to compleat his &s;atisfaction, my
<PB N="40" REF="39">
health, in con&s;equence of a change of regimen pro|po&s;ed
by my very learned friend Dr James Gre|gory
of Edinburgh, had become better: and the
organ, when he had &s;et it up, and tuned it, was
found to be &s;ingularly good in its kind. We had
now little mu&s;ical entertainments twice or thrice
a week; which, though to a modi&s;h audience they
might have appeared unfa&s;hionable, were highly
plea&s;ing to us, and to tho&s;e friends who were &s;ome|times
pre&s;ent at them. Three of our &s;mall band
could &s;ing pretty well; and to the in&s;trumental
part of the concert a violin, violoncello, and organ,
gave tolerable variety.</P>
<P>SOME weeks before the commencement of his
la&s;t illne&s;s, he a&s;ked whether I had any objection
to his &s;tudying phy&s;ick. I was a little alarmed at
the que&s;tion, and a&s;ked in my turn, whether upon
trial he had found his office in the college le&s;s a|greeable
than he thought it would be. &startq;Quite
the contrary,&endq; he replied, &startq;I have found it even
more to my mind than I expected.&endq; He pro|ceeded
to explain him&s;elf, to the be&s;t of my re|membrance,
in the following words. &startq;I fore&s;ee
that when I &s;hall have prepared a few lectures,
our long &s;ummer vacation will afford me abun|dance
<PB N="41" REF="40">
of lei&s;ure. It is true that, in the &s;tudy of
nature and art, a man can never be without the
means of improvement and liberal recreation.
But there is a duty more indi&s;pen&s;able, which I
am anxious to have it in my power to di&s;charge;
I mean, that of relieving the &s;ufferings of my
fellow creatures. To appear in the world as a
phy&s;ician, or to accept of money for what I may
do in a medical character, is not my plan: Pro|vidence
has &s;o ordered matters, that I can live,
as well as I wi&s;h to live, without that: but I would
fain be u&s;eful, occa&s;ionally to my friends, and
to the poor e&s;pecially; for whom however I
will not take it upon me to pre&s;cribe, till I &s;hall
have gone through a complete cour&s;e of medical
&s;tudy.&endq; I told him, it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to
object to a &s;cheme undertaken from motives &s;o lau|dable:
&startq;all the re&s;traint I would impo&s;e, added I,
is, what to you I am continually recommending,
moderate application. Anatomy, botany, che|mi&s;try,
you already know, and are not ignorant
of pharmacy. Study phy&s;ick, therefore, &s;ince
you de&s;ire it; but let it be now and them only,
when you are at lei&s;ure; and you will &s;oon be
as great a proficient as many others are, who
acquit them&s;elves in that profe&s;&s;ion both credi|tably
<PB N="42" REF="41">
and u&s;efully.&endq; It appears from his papers,
that he had been very eager to prepare him&s;elf
for doing good in this new employment. But
the time was now at hand, when all his plans of
benevolence were to cea&s;e, and all his pur&s;uits in
literature.</P>
<P>IN the night of the thirtieth of November 1789
he was &s;uddenly &s;eized with a violent fit of fever,
attended with exce&s;&s;ive trembling and &s;hivering,
&s;uch as &s;eemed to threaten his immediate di&s;&s;olu|tion.
Medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance was in&s;tantly procured,
and before morning a per&s;piration en&s;ued, which
freed him from fever, but left him weak and lan|guid.
This night mu&s;t be con&s;idered as the end
of his literary career; for, though he lived almo&s;t
a year longer, he was never after able to engage
in &s;tudy that required any energy of mind. From
this time to his death the night &s;weats continued
to mole&s;t him, though they were not often vio|lent:
and now a decline came on, wonderfully
gradual, though it &s;eemed in general to gain a lit|tle
ground every week. He made, however, his
daily excur&s;ions; and in February was &s;till able
to walk a few miles without fatigue. Attempts
were made to prepare him for a journey in a po&s;t
<PB N="43" REF="42">
chai&s;e; but without &s;ucce&s;s: every experiment of
this kind, however cautiou&s;ly conducted, being
followed by a fit of fever unu&s;ually &s;evere. Ri|ding
on hor&s;eback he had never found beneficial,
and at this time could not bear at all. Still how|ever
it was &s;uppo&s;ed, by the phy&s;icians, as well as
by him&s;elf, and by me, as he had no cough, nor
difficulty in breathing, nor indeed any po&s;itive
pain, that nothing wor&s;e was the matter, than
what is called a relaxation of the nervous &s;y&s;tem;
and that, when the &s;ea&s;on would permit, a few
weeks of Peterhead would &s;et him up again, as had
happened to him &s;everal times in ca&s;es apparently
&s;imilar. To get thither he was more anxious than
I ever &s;aw him about any other thing that con|cerned
him&s;elf. Thither accordingly we went the
nineteenth of April, and he bore the journey bet|ter
than I expected. But next day a dreadful
&s;torm &s;et in of rain and wind, which continued a
week, during which it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to
leave his room. This confinement broke down
his &s;trength &s;o much, that he could no longer
walk without leaning on &s;omebody's arm; nor
bear the motion of a carriage, unle&s;s it went very
&s;lowly. His ca&s;e was now called by the phy&s;icians
a <HI>nervous atrophy;</HI> and Dr Gregory candidly in|formed
<PB N="44" REF="43">
me that, though not de&s;perate, it was dan|gerous
in the extreme. I need not give a detail
of the tran&s;actions of this &s;ummer. Let it &s;uffice
to &s;ay, that he had every advantage that could
be derived from the mo&s;t &s;kilful and affectionate
phy&s;icians, particularly Dr Skene, Dr Gregory,
Dr Laing, Dr Bannerman, and Mr Wil&s;on &s;ur|geon<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In con&s;ideration of Mr Wil&s;on's affectionate and judicious at|tention, the Univer&s;ity of Mari&s;chal college, who were no &s;tran|gers to his medical and literary character, conferred on him the degree of Doctor of Phy&s;ick. He did not long &s;urvive his friend; but lo&s;t his life in a &s;torm at &s;ea in December 1792. He was a young man of great goodne&s;s of heart, exten&s;ive learning, indefa|tigable indu&s;try, and the &s;tricte&s;t rectitude of principle.</NOTE>,
who was his intimate friend, and who not
only attended, but almo&s;t con&s;tantly &s;at by him
the four la&s;t months of his life. By the goodne&s;s
of Providence, every thing was procured for him
that the phy&s;icians recommended. Twice I went
with him to &s;ea; and the fir&s;t attempt (an excur|&s;ion
of ten leagues from Peterhead to Aberdeen)
&s;ucceeded &s;o well, that he was anxious to make a
&s;econd; which, however, had, as I feared it would
have, di&s;agreeable con&s;equences, though nothing
materially pernicious followed it. In the end of
<PB N="45" REF="44">
June, a cough made its appearance; and it was
then I began to lo&s;e hopes of his recovery, as I
have rea&s;on to think he al&s;o did: he &s;aw death
approaching, and met it with his u&s;ual calmne&s;s
and re&s;ignation. &startq;How plea&s;ant a medicine is
Chri&s;tianity!&endq; he &s;aid one evening, while he
was expecting the phy&s;ician, whom he had &s;ent
for, in the belief that he was ju&s;t going to expire.
Sometimes he would endeavour to reconcile my
mind to the thought of parting with him; but,
for fear of giving me pain, &s;poke &s;eldom and &s;par|ingly
on that &s;ubject. His compo&s;ure he retain|ed,
as well as the full u&s;e of his rational faculties,
to the la&s;t; nor did his wit and humour for&s;ake
him, till he was no longer able to &s;mile, or even
to &s;peak except in a whi&s;per. His la&s;t allu&s;ion to
literature, and probably the la&s;t time his favour|ite
Virgil occurred to his mind, was on occa&s;ion of
&s;ome difference of opinion happening when he was
pre&s;ent, between Mr Wil&s;on and me, about the
meaning of a Greek word. To give him a little
amu&s;ement, I referred the matter to him. AH!
&s;aid he with a &s;mile, (finding him&s;elf unable to &s;ay
more) FUIMUS TROES.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="45">
ONE day, long before the little incident la&s;t
mentioned, when I was &s;itting by him, &s;oon after
our &s;econd return from &s;ea, he began to &s;peak in
very affectionate terms, as he often did, of what
he called my goodne&s;s to him. I begged him to
drop that &s;ubject; and was proceeding to tell him
that I had never done any thing for him but what
duty required and inclination prompted; and that
for the little I had done his filial piety and other
virtues were to me more than a &s;ufficient recom|pence,&mdash;when
he interrupted me (which he was
not apt to do) and, &s;tarting up, with inexpre&s;&s;ible
fervour and &s;olemnity, implored the ble&s;&s;ing of
God upon me. His look at that moment, though
I &s;hall never forget it, I can de&s;cribe in no other
way than by &s;aying, that it &s;eemed to have in it
&s;omething more than human, and what I may,
not very improperly perhaps, call angelic. Seeing
me agitated, he expre&s;&s;ed concern for what he had
done, and &s;aid that, whatever might be in his
mind, he would not any more put my feelings to
&s;o &s;evere a trial. Sometimes, however, warm &s;en|timents
of gratitude would break from him: and
tho&s;e were the only occa&s;ions on which, during the
whole cour&s;e of his illne&s;s, he was ob&s;erved to &s;hed
tears;&mdash;till the day before his death; when he de|&s;ired
<PB N="47" REF="46">
to &s;ee his brother, gave him his ble&s;&s;ing, wept
over him, and bid him farewell.</P>
<P>As his life drew towards a clo&s;e, his pains aba|ted
con&s;iderably, and he pa&s;&s;ed a good deal of time
in &s;leep. When I a&s;ked him, whether his dreams
were di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, he &s;aid, &startq;No; for that he &s;ome|times
dreamed of walking with me; which was
an idea peculiarly &s;oothing to his mind.&endq;</P>
<P>AT &s;even in the morning of the nineteenth of
November 1790, he &s;aid his throat was dry, and
de&s;ired a draught to be given him. Mr Wil&s;on
&s;tept to the table to fetch it; but, before he got
back to the bed&s;ide, the la&s;t breath was emitted,
without a groan or even a &s;igh.</P>
<P>OVER his grave, in the churchyard of St. Nico|las
in Aberdeen, is erected a piece of marble, for
which I compo&s;ed the following in&s;cription:</P>

<P>OF his character and opinions I &s;hall &s;ubjoin
&s;ome further particulars, which could not be con|veniently
introduced in the preceding narrative.
<PB N="94" REF="48">
I &s;et them down as they occur, without attempt|ing
arrangement.</P>
<P>PIETY and meekne&s;s were &s;triking features in
his character, habitual to him in infancy, and
through life. I find among his papers forms of
devotion, compo&s;ed for his own u&s;e; of which I
may perhaps give a &s;pecimen. The Chri&s;tian Re|ligion
and its evidences he had &s;tudied with in|defatigable
application; and the con&s;equence was
&s;uch, as may be always expected in like ca&s;es,
where the inquirer has candour and &s;en&s;e: no per|&s;on
could love his religion more than he did, or
believe in it with fuller a&s;&s;urance of faith. But
in his behaviour there was no au&s;terity or &s;ingu|larity.
Even when he came to be a man, he had,
when in health, and in the company of his inti|mate
friends, all the playfulne&s;s of a boy. The
effect of religion upon his mind was, to make him
chearful, con&s;iderate, benevolent, intrepid, hum|ble,
and happy. Of the contracted principles and
unamiable prejudices of &s;ectaries he had no con|ception.
He loved all the human race; he bore
a particular love to all Chri&s;tians; and he wi&s;hed
all parties to exerci&s;e Chri&s;tian charity towards
each other. The church of England he held in
<PB N="50" REF="49">
high veneration, and was al&s;o attached to the
church of Scotland in which he had been educat|ed;
he knew that, in re&s;pect of doctrine, the prin|ciples
of both are the &s;ame; and, as to the differ|ent
forms of eccle&s;ia&s;tical di&s;cipline and wor&s;hip,
he did not think he had any right to affect &s;ingu|larity,
or to mole&s;t the peace of either church by
clamouring about matters of no e&s;&s;ential import|ance.
He wi&s;hed to be, and to be con&s;idered as,
a CHRISTIAN: a title, which he thought infinite|ly
more honourable than any other. The words
Lutheran and Calvini&s;t he well under&s;tood, but
&s;et no value on them; though he was ever ready
to own his obligations to tho&s;e learned men who
had been in&s;trumental in bringing about the re|formation
from popery.</P>
<P>OF modern divines his greate&s;t favourite was
Dr Clarke. He &s;tudied all that author's works
with his u&s;ual accuracy, and with much delight.
Even the controver&s;y with Dodwell he &s;tudied;
for he thought it &s;trictly connected with what
Baxter and others had taught concerning the in|corporeal
nature of the &s;oul: a doctrine, of which
he was a zealous defender; which he had examin|ed
as far, I believe, as human ingenuity can ex|amine
<PB N="51" REF="50">
it; and on which he has left a great deal
in writing, though nothing fini&s;hed. I need not
add, for after what has been &s;aid it will be natu|rally
&s;uppo&s;ed, that he was a warm admirer of
Dr Campbell's excellent writings, and very judi|cious
Tran&s;lation of the Go&s;pels.</P>
<P>I SPOKE of his playfulne&s;s. In conver&s;ation
with his particular friends he would di&s;play an a|mazing
exuberance of plea&s;antry and humour.
His knowledge of nature and exten&s;ive learning,
&s;upplied him with innumerable images; and his
lively fancy, aided by &s;implicity of diction and a
ready eloquence, enabled him to combine them in|to
the mo&s;t diverting forms that could be imagined.
He had, what perhaps all people of ob&s;ervation
have, a &s;light tendency to &s;atire; but it was of the
gentle&s;t kind; he had too much candour and good|nature
to be either a general &s;atiri&s;t or a &s;evere one.
That taunting, gibing, raillery, which &s;ome people,
who mi&s;take ill-nature for wit, are &s;o fond of, he
de&s;pi&s;ed and hated: he often, as his duty required,
&s;poke in order to improve and amend others;
but never uttered a word with a view to give pain.
Characters, however, there were, of which he was
at no pains to conceal what he thought. If per|&s;ons,
<PB N="52" REF="51">
notoriou&s;ly profligate; or who in publick
office &s;eemed to him to have betrayed their tru&s;t;
or who, rendered impudent by immorality and
ignorance, ventured to retail the wretched impie|ties
of infidelity;&mdash;if &s;uch per&s;ons happened to be
&s;poken of in his hearing, it was ea&s;y to perceive,
that his ab&s;taining from general &s;atire was ow|ing
to the want, not of talents, but of inclina|tion.</P>
<P>I MENTIONED that acutene&s;s of intellect, which
enabled him to enter with facility into the ab&s;tru|&s;e&s;t
doctrines of the ab&s;tract philo&s;ophy. He
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a talent &s;till more u&s;eful, in which men
of acute minds are &s;ometimes deficient; and that
was Good Sen&s;e. He could in&s;tantly, and almo&s;t
intuitively, di&s;cern what in human conduct was
right or wrong, prudent or imprudent; not only
in matters of morality and &s;cience, but in the ge|neral
intercour&s;e of the world. Of his &s;uperiori|ty
in this talent I was &s;o &s;en&s;ible, that, during the
la&s;t four or five years of his life, I &s;eldom re&s;olved
on any thing that had difficulty in it; without
con&s;ulting him; and I never went wrong by fol|lowing
his advice.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="52">
THE delicacy (I may even call it the purity) of
his mind was greater than I have known in any
other man, at lea&s;t in any other young man; and,
in one &s;o young, was truly admirable, and wor|thy
of imitation. He was aware of the danger of
admitting indelicate or improper thoughts into
his mind; for he knew that a&s;&s;ociations of ideas,
di&s;approved both by rea&s;on as incongruous, and
by con&s;cience as immoral, might in a moment be
formed, in con&s;equence of inattention, even when
there was no &s;ettled propen&s;ity to evil. To give
an example or two of this delicacy, that my mean|ing
may be under&s;tood, (one cannot be very ex|plicit
on this &s;ubject); &s;uch a book as that mo&s;t
contemptible one called <HI>Scotch Pre&s;byterian eloquence
di&s;played</HI> he would not have looked into on any
account whatever; becau&s;e he had heard, that pa&s;|&s;ages
of Scripture are introduced in it, for the pur|po&s;e
of rai&s;ing laughter. Silly tales and jokes of
the &s;ame nature he would &s;ometimes hear in com|pany
(they are too often heard from tho&s;e of whom
better things might be expected); but he always
&s;howed di&s;plea&s;ure at hearing, and never repeated
them. And, notwith&s;tanding his love of the ta|lent
called <HI>Humour,</HI> he would never read <HI>The Tale
of a Tub:</HI> becau&s;e he had heard me &s;ay, that there
<PB N="54" REF="53">
are in it gro&s;s indecencies; and that, by forming
ludicrous a&s;&s;ociations of the meane&s;t ideas with
the mo&s;t awful truths of religion, it could hardly
fail in &s;ome degree to di&s;order and deba&s;e the
mind. I did not tell him this, or any thing el&s;e,
in a dictatorial manner; nor did I ever forbid
him to read that book. But his attention was con|tinually
awake, to learn, although from the &s;light|e&s;t
hint or mo&s;t trivial circum&s;tance, what might
be u&s;eful in purifying his mind, regulating his
conduct, or improving his under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>THUS formed, thus enlightened, and thus inured
to con&s;ideration, a mind po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;en&s;ibility can
never be deficient in Ta&s;te or Critical Sagacity.
In this re&s;pect he was highly accompli&s;hed; of
which however it is no proof to &s;ay, that at the
age of eighteen he was a better judge of com|po&s;ition
than I had been at thirty. It may be
thought, that I would not neglect to explain to
him the principles of good writing, as far as I
knew them; and this part of my duty I did not
neglect: but my diligence in it bore no proportion
to his proficiency; which I impute to his natural
rectitude of under&s;tanding, aided by con&s;tantly
reading the be&s;t authors, and ab&s;taining, as he
<PB N="55" REF="54">
&s;crupulou&s;ly did, from &s;uch as fall below, or do not
ri&s;e above, mediocrity. They, who may be plea&s;|ed
to &s;ay, that at this rate he mu&s;t have kept at a
di&s;tance from what I have attempted in writing,
are at liberty to think &s;o. To me, and to every
thing connected with me, he was partial; as I have
acknowledged already: and they who under&s;tand
human nature will not think the wor&s;e of him,
either as a man, or as a critick, for having had
this infirmity. A di&s;like of <HI>ambitious ornaments,</HI>
and, what I might almo&s;t call, an <HI>abhorrence</HI> of
o&s;tentation, appeared in him very early in life;
and were heightened and confirmed by &s;tudying
tho&s;e antient writers, particularly Homer, Xen$|phon,
Herodotus, Ce&s;ar, and others, who are di&s;|tingui&s;hed
by a &s;evere and maje&s;tick &s;implicity of
&s;tyle.</P>
<P>WHEN he began to learn the French language,
of which, under an experienced teacher, he acquir|ed
very exactly the elements and pronunciation,
I, remembering with what delight I had in my
youth read <HI>Telemaque,</HI> recommended that work to
his peru&s;al, and told him he would be highly en|tertained
with it. In this, however, I was mi&s;tak|en.
After going through one half, he begged I
<PB N="56" REF="55">
would not in&s;i&s;t on his reading the other, at lea&s;t
at pre&s;ent. &startq;I acknowledge, &s;aid he, the author's
merit as a politician and morali&s;t, and I believe
he writes the French tongue in its utmo&s;t puri|ty;
but I have been &s;tudying Homer's Ody&s;|&s;ey,
the &s;implicity of which delights me; and
with this impre&s;&s;ion on my mind I cannot ju&s;t
now reli&s;h the flowery de&s;criptions of Fenelon.&endq;
He mentioned other objections, which I need not
repeat. I &s;aid, he might lay Telemaque a&s;ide,
till he found him&s;elf di&s;po&s;ed to re&s;ume it, and in
the mean time return to his Homer; for who&s;e
&s;implicity and grandeur I was much plea&s;ed to
find that he had a true ta&s;te. He was about fif|teen
when this little conference pa&s;&s;ed. It may
give modi&s;h readers a mean opinion of his judge|ment:
on tho&s;e who have conver&s;ed, as he had,
with ancient authors, it may perhaps have a con|trary
effect.</P>
<P>TIME was not allowed him for going deep into
the literature of France: his favourite authors of
that nation were Moliere and Boileau. Of Rou&s;|&s;eau
he knew little; and &s;uch was his opinion of
Voltaire's principles and character, that he had no
curio&s;ity to inquire after his books. Of the French
<PB N="57" REF="56">
tongue he &s;eemed to think, that its want of har|mony,
and being almo&s;t entirely made up of idi|omatick
phra&s;es, rendered it unfit for the higher
poetry, and for elevated compo&s;ition in general;
but he did not think him&s;elf &s;ufficiently &s;killed in
it to pretend to judge of its merit. Italian, which
he would probably have found more to his mind,
he meant to &s;tudy, but did not live to do it.</P>
<P>HE was a ma&s;ter in Greek and Latin: and in
getting tho&s;e languages was much aided by his
&s;kill in the Grammatical art; without which it is
indeed impo&s;&s;ible (though projectors have thought
otherwi&s;e) to learn them with accuracy; and, if
they are not accurately learned, the acqui&s;ition is
not of great value. I find, by his papers, that he
had exerci&s;ed him&s;elf a little in Greek compo&s;i|tion;
which I believe is not often done in Scot|land.
Latin he &s;poke correctly and readily. In
that language he and I &s;ometimes conver&s;ed when
we were by our&s;elves; and he &s;oon became my
&s;uperiour in this as in every other talent. Mo&s;t
of the things I have publi&s;hed of late years were
&s;ubmitted in manu&s;cript to his revi&s;al, and receiv|ed
from him valuable emendations. What he
propo&s;ed in this way I never &s;aw rea&s;on to reject.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="57">
IN a pocket-book of his, I find hints and me|morandums,
&s;ome in Latin, &s;ome in Engli&s;h,
which do honour to his character:&mdash;pious purpo|&s;es,
&mdash;re&s;olutions re&s;pecting his behaviour in &s;o|ciety;
&mdash;and titles, and plans, of intended di&s;&s;er|tations
on various &s;ubjects. Among the&s;e is &startq;A
di&s;cour&s;e on the Lord's prayer, con&s;idered as an
evidence of the truth of Chri&s;tianity.&endq; It could
not, he &s;aid, be contrived either by an impo&s;tor,
or by the di&s;ciples of an impo&s;tor. I have heard
him talk on the &s;ubject, and was &s;o well plea&s;ed
with his rea&s;oning, that though, in con&s;ideration
of his health, I wi&s;hed him to write little and &s;el|dom,
I even advi&s;ed him to pro&s;ecute that argu|ment;
which, however, his la&s;t illne&s;s prevented.</P>
<P>ANOTHER thing, which the pocket-book in|forms
me he had re&s;olved to <HI>think of,</HI> was &startq;An
e&s;&s;ay on the writings and genius of Ari&s;totle.&endq;
Of this great ancient he was a warm but a ration|al
admirer. He had &s;tudied his be&s;t works, par|ticularly
his Ethicks, Poeticks and Politicks: and,
while he regretted his entangling him&s;elf &s;o much
in the trammels of a technical and unprofitable
logick, owned that he found in him remarks and
&s;ugge&s;tions &s;o uncommon and &s;o judicious, as to
<PB N="59" REF="58">
merit the attention of every philo&s;opher and
&s;cholar.</P>
<P>OF &s;ome others of his projected di&s;&s;ertations I
&s;hall ju&s;t mention the titles, as I find them in the
pocket-book: which will &s;how at lea&s;t, that he
had an active mind, and was anxious to do good.

Quintilian, and other authors. Of the&s;e
I may perhaps be better qualified, than at pre|&s;ent,
to give an account, when I &s;hall have found
lei&s;ure to arrange his pro&s;e writings.</P>
<P>FROM the Greek drama he expected much en|tertainment,
but was di&s;appointed. In Sophocles
he found beautiful pa&s;&s;ages, a plea&s;ing &s;implicity,
and moral &s;entences well expre&s;&s;ed; but little in|cident,
not much contrivance, and no very nice
di&s;crimination of characters. He agreed with
me in opinion, that antient tragedy mu&s;t have de|rived
its charm rather from the magnificence of
the &s;cene, than from the genius of the poet; or,
at lea&s;t, that there mu&s;t have been, in the exhibi|tion,
&s;ome attractive circum&s;tances, whereof we
know little or nothing, and are therefore not qua|lified
to judge. He thought, that in any one of
Shake&s;pear's be&s;t plays, in Othello, for example, or
Lear, there was more &s;trength and variety of in|vention,
and more knowledge of human nature,
than in any Dramatick author of antiquity. Of
our wonderful dramati&s;t he was a great admirer:
<PB N="66" REF="65">
the favourite plays were, I think, Lear, Othello,
Macbeth, Henry IV, and the Merry Wives of
Wind&s;or.</P>
<P>BY &s;ome people, more prompt to &s;peak and
prone to cen&s;ure, than acute to ob&s;erve, his cha|racter
was mi&s;taken. They imputed his mode&s;ty
to timourou&s;ne&s;s; and thought, or &s;aid at lea&s;t,
that I kept him &s;ecluded from &s;ociety, obliged
him to apply too much to books, and gave him
no opportunities of knowing the world. In ju&s;|tice
both to him and to my&s;elf, I mu&s;t enter into
&s;ome particulars on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>WHEN at home, indeed, he was not frequently
&s;een in the &s;treet; a laudable regard to health,
and a pa&s;&s;ionate love of rural &s;cenery, leading him
to daily excur&s;ions in the fields: it is al&s;o true,
that of tea-tables he was no regular frequenter;
and that at card-tables and in ball-rooms, (things
of no &s;mall importance in a country town) he
never appeared at all. By the intelligent reader,
after what he has heard of him, it will not be
&s;uppo&s;ed, that this was the effect of re&s;traint on
my part: on the contrary, it would have been
unrea&s;onable and cruel re&s;traint, if in the&s;e things
<PB N="67" REF="66">
I had not readily complied, as I con&s;tantly did,
with his inclination.</P>
<P>BUT I doubt, whether any other young man
in North Britain, of his years and &s;tation, had
better opportunities than he, of &s;eeing what is
called the world; and a more accurate, or more
&s;agacious, ob&s;erver of it, I have not known. He
never was in a foreign country; but in England
and Scotland his acquaintance was nearly as ex|ten&s;ive
as mine; and to many per&s;ons, in both
countries, of great di&s;tinction in rank and litera|ture,
he had the honour to be known, and to be
indebted for particular civilities. To give a li&s;t
of names might be thought to &s;avour of vanity
rather than gratitude; yet it is not improba|ble
that gratitude may one day induce me to give
&s;uch a li&s;t.&mdash;Of the principles on which I con|ducted
his education, and of his own opinion of
tho&s;e principles, I leave the candid reader to judge
from the preceding narrative.</P>
<P>IN infancy, his health was very delicate, and
he was &s;omewhat timourous; not more &s;o, how|ever,
than well-natured children, who fear to of|fend,
commonly are. But his piety and good.
<PB N="68" REF="67">
&s;en&s;e, the manly exerci&s;es in which he delighted,
and his being &s;o early accu&s;tomed to the u&s;e of
arms, got the better of that timidity; &s;o that, be|fore
he grew up to manhood, he was as fearle&s;s
as a man ought to be. I know not any one, in
who&s;e fortitude I could have confided more, on
any perilous emergency. Several times I have
&s;een him in danger; once particularly in Yar|mouth
roads, when every per&s;on on board our
ve&s;&s;el, every per&s;on at lea&s;t who was on the up|per
deck, imagined it was on the point of found|ering.
I took him by the hand, made him &s;wal|low
a gla&s;s of wine; and, on looking at him, &s;aw
his countenance perfectly undi&s;mayed, and I be|lieve
more compo&s;ed than any other in the &s;hip.
He was then in his &s;ixteenth year.</P>
<P>IT was al&s;o &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome, as he was often
&s;een walking alone, or with me, and &s;eldom or
never with more than one companion, that he
mu&s;t be of an un&s;ocial di&s;po&s;ition. The rever&s;e
was his character; he was &s;ocial, chearful, and
affectionate, and by tho&s;e friends who thorough|ly
knew him beloved even to enthu&s;ia&s;m. In his
choice of friends, indeed, he was not ha&s;ty. For
in di&s;cerning characters he was, as already ob&s;er|ved,
<PB N="69" REF="68">
&s;ingularly per&s;picacious; and the &s;lighte&s;t
appearance of immorality, vanity, pedantry, coar&s;e
manners, or blameable levity, di&s;gu&s;ted him;
though he &s;howed his di&s;gu&s;t by &s;ilence only, or
withdrawing from the company.</P>
<P>HE had a pa&s;&s;ion for vi&s;iting places that had
been remarkable as the abodes of eminent men,
or that retained any memorials of them; and, as
in this I re&s;embled him, we often walked together
on what he called cla&s;&s;ick ground. We&s;tmin&s;ter
abbey, in the neighbourhood of which we lived
&s;everal months, was a favourite haunt of his, and
&s;ugge&s;ted many images and meditations. He had
wandered in the bowers of Twickenham, and a|mid&s;t
the more maje&s;tick &s;cenes of Blenheim and
Wind&s;or. At Oxford, where we pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time,
he met with many intere&s;ting objects and atten|tive
friends. He ki&s;&s;ed (literally he did &s;o) the
grave-&s;tone which covers the du&s;t of Shaek&s;pear
at Stratford; and &s;at in the &s;ame chimney-cor|ner,
and in the &s;ame chair, in which tradition tells
that the immortal bard was wont to &s;it. He once
or twice vi&s;ited the village, the hou&s;e, and even
the chamber (near Colt&s;worth in Lincoln&s;hire) in
which Sir I&s;aac Newton is &s;aid to have been born.
<PB N="70" REF="69">
The la&s;t time he and I were in Cambridge, I gra|tified
him with a &s;ight of tho&s;e apartments in
Pembroke hall, which were once honoured with
the re&s;idence of my memorable and long-lament|ed
friend Mr Gray; of whom he was a warm ad|mirer,
thinking him the greate&s;t poetical genius
that Britain had produced &s;ince Milton. He com|po&s;ed
an ode in&s;cribed &startq;To the genius of Gray,&endq;
of which I find among his papers a few &s;tanzas;
but far the greater part is irrecoverably lo&s;t. This
ode I think he wrote, or planned, while we were
pa&s;&s;ing &s;ome time in 1787 at Wind&s;or; where,
from the terrace, he had a view of Stoke church,
in which Gray is buried, and towards which I
often found him directing his eyes.</P>
<P>WHEN his curio&s;ity was rai&s;ed with re&s;pect to
any work of art, he always wi&s;hed to make him|&s;elf
ma&s;ter of at lea&s;t the theory of it. In his ear|ly
days he was &s;killed in various &s;orts of legerde|main;
but left it off entirely, as trifling in it&s;elf,
and o&s;tentatious in the performance. One even|ing
of his thirteenth year, he and I arrived in
Newark on Trent, ju&s;t as an exhibition of fire|works
was beginning in the market place. It
was indeed a magnificent &s;pectacle, and the fir&s;t
<PB N="71" REF="70">
of the kind he had &s;een. He immediately re&s;olv|ed
to &s;tudy fireworks; and, finding in London a
&s;y&s;tematick book on the &s;ubject, applied to it &s;o
&s;ucce&s;sfully, that, for &s;everal years after, he would
now and then exhibit in that way, for the amu&s;e|ment
of his friends.</P>
<P>AMONG his Latin memorandums, there is a re|&s;olution
&startq;never to engage in games of chance.&endq;
Cards he dete&s;ted; as de&s;tructive of time at lea&s;t,
if not of money: which in him I thought the
more remarkable, as he had, when a boy, learned
(I know not how) to play at what is called <HI>quadrille,</HI>
and &s;ome other games. In tho&s;e days he often
urged me to play at cards, &s;aying, he was &s;ure it
would amu&s;e me. I told him, I had &s;everal times
attempted quadrille; but that, of the directions gi|ven me,
&s;ome I could never under&s;tand, and &s;ome I
could never remember. He begged leave to write
a few directions: and I gave him leave; being
curious to know, how a lad of eleven years of age
would acquit him&s;elf in re&s;pect of &s;tyle, and the
arrangement of his matter. He brought me two
treati&s;es, (&s;till extant) one of quadrille, the other
of back-gammon, written with a propriety, per&s;pi|cuity,
and correctne&s;s, that very agreeably &s;ur|pri&s;ed
<PB N="72" REF="71">
me. I could not help telling him, as was
true, that I under&s;tood them much better than
any oral information I had ever received on tho&s;e
&s;ubjects.</P>
<P>THERE is another fa&s;hionable recreation, to which
he could not reconcile his mind, the reading of
romances. The time employed in that way he
held to be lo&s;t. Don Quixote, however, Robin&s;on
Cru&s;oe, and Cecilia, he read with plea&s;ure, and be|gan,
but could not get through, Gil Blas. Hear|ing
that an acquaintance of his had almo&s;t had
his brain turned with <HI>The Adventures of Roderick
Random,</HI> he had the curio&s;ity to a&s;k for that book,
but quickly laid it a&s;ide, and would never after|wards
re&s;ume it. To amu&s;e &s;ome hours of lan|gour,
in the commencement of his la&s;t illne&s;s, I
advi&s;ed him to look into Fielding; and he read
Tom Jones, and, I think, Amelia. He gave that
author no little prai&s;e for his humour, for the ve|ry
&s;kilful management of his fable, the variety
and contra&s;t of his characters, and, with a few ex|ceptions,
for the beautiful &s;implicity of his &s;tyle:
but &s;till&mdash;the time &s;pent in reading it was lo&s;t;
and there was more danger from the indelicacy
of particular pa&s;&s;ages, than hope of its doing good

<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO DR B. AT G. CASTLE.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Peterhead, <DATE>11th October 1787.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR letter, which I received this morning, gives me great joy,
as it informs me, that you have good health, agreeable company,
and plea&s;ant weather. If I except one or two tolerable days, we have
had, ever &s;ince you left this place, almo&s;t continual ea&s;terly winds,
with a due proportion of rain, and <HI>quant. &s;uff.</HI> of Peterhead fog:
and I have been troubled with a &s;light degree of &s;ore throat, which,
though not otherwi&s;e very inconvenient, made me ab&s;tain for &s;ome
time from drinking the mineral water. The pain in my throat,
however, is now gone, and in other re&s;pects I am as well as u&s;ual.
You wi&s;h to know what I have been doing.&mdash;I have, then, con|ver&s;ed
with Dr L&mdash;about natural philo&s;ophy, and his patients,
and his organ; with Mr W&mdash;about Greenland, and navigation,
and whales &amp;c.; with Mrs A&mdash;about Mrs M&mdash;and Bi&s;hop
Butler: I have played at back-gammon with Father S&mdash;, and
have deplored with his Son the pre&s;ent &s;tate of partridges, and the
u&s;ele&s;s &s;everity of the game-act. Moreover, I have amu&s;ed my|&s;elf
with walking and &s;hooting, as far as the weather and the laws
would permit; and have rode on hor&s;eback to <HI>Bullers Buchan,</HI>
which, though indeed terribly magnificent, hardly came up to the
expectations I had formed of it. My &s;teed is not de&s;cended from
Pyroeis or Ethon, but is a very good fort of animal, and one of
the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible for my purpo&s;e, not having &s;en&s;e enough to &s;tart,
or &s;trength enough to run away: and it would be very wicked if
I were to find fault with him, as his ma&s;ter let the cart lie idle in
order to accommodate me.&mdash;Thus I have given you a full and true
account of all my proceedings; &s;peaking non&s;en&s;e, for the u&s;ual
rea&s;on, becau&s;e I have nothing el&s;e to &s;ay.</P>
<P>I am much obliged to you for the ver&s;es, which I have read again
and again with great &s;atisfaction. I admire the ver&s;ification and
turn of the language; e&s;pecially in that line &startq;Beaming with
the benignity of heaven.&endq; The poem has (what very few com|plimental
poems have) truth, and a good moral, with beautiful
and pertinent de&s;cription. I am, &amp;c. Your J. H. B.</P>
</LETTER>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To DR B&mdash;EDINBURGH.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Peterhead, <DATE>27th April 1789.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I WRITE this letter, becau&s;e I promi&s;ed it; although I doubt
whether it will arrive in Edinburgh before you &s;et out on your re|turn
homeward. I have little news to &s;end you, except what
you may have heard already, that *; and what you will not
care much whether you hear or no, that *. I may tell
you further, that Dr L's thank&s;giving &s;ermon, for His Maje&s;ty's
happy recovery, has been much applauded;&mdash;it was appo&s;ite, ani|mated,
and loyal.</P>
<P>I HAVE not yet begun to drink the water, but I believe I ought
to have begun; and I think I &s;hall in a day or two. I walk out
frequently; and have been twice at the river, which is in tolera|bly
good condition for angling. And I have read the <HI>Trial of the
witne&s;&s;es of the re&s;urrection,</HI> &amp;c. (my chief objection to which is,
that I wi&s;h there had been a little more of it;) and &s;ome of
Clarke's Sermons, who&s;e character and doctrines I admire the
more the better I grow acquainted with them. So much for news
of my noble &s;elf.</P>
<P>I THINK we were talking lately about that &s;entence&mdash;&startq;all ac|tion
implies motion: but there may be motion where there
is no action;&endq; and you intended, I believe, to change the la&s;t
clau&s;e to&mdash;&startq;there may be motion in that which is no agent.&endq;
&mdash;I have &s;till &s;ome difficulties about the former clau&s;e. That all
action implies motion is indeed indi&s;putable, if <HI>motion</HI> be u&s;ed for
<HI>change of &s;tate;</HI> but I doubt whether it be indi&s;putable if <HI>motion</HI>
be under&s;tood to &s;ignify <HI>change of place.</HI></P>
<P>THAT every action of &s;pirit upon matter implies motion, one
may venture to affirm. But my doubt regards the reflex opera|tions
of &s;pirit; as our recollection, for example, or invention;
concerning which, if we have no proof that the mind in order to
their performance mu&s;t change the place of any corporeal organs;
and no proof that the mind it&s;elf could not be as able to perform
them in one place as in another; I think it is not clear that they
imply change of place, although they certainly are actions.&mdash;Not
to &s;peak of the agency of Him, who being every where perpetual|ly
pre&s;ent, cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to move from one point of &s;pace to
another.</P>
<P>IF you think this of any con&s;equence, a &s;hort note, or &s;light
change of expre&s;&s;ion, will remove the difficulty; if otherwi&s;e, you
mu&s;t impute my remarks to the pre&s;ent want of news; and
con&s;ider them as &s;tuffed into my letter, like &s;aw-du&s;t or brown
paper into a travelling trunk, merely to fill up an empty corner,
and not for any value of their own.</P>
<P>I HOPE to &s;ee you &s;oon, and to hear from you as often as you
can conveniently write. Compliments to&mdash;and Montagu,
whom I congratulate on his great journey, and all his new ex|perience
of the world. I hope he will not leave his declen&s;ions
and conjugations behind him at Edinburgh.&mdash;Ever Your J. H. B.</P>

<P>But &s;ome may think, enough has been &s;aid;
though there are a few, who know that the &s;ub|ject
is by no means exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P>ABOUT the di&s;po&s;al of his papers he gave no
directions: being, I &s;uppo&s;e, prevented, either by
<PB N="76" REF="75">
his thinking them unworthy of notice, or by his
unwillingne&s;s to pain me by &s;peaking of his di&s;|&s;olution.
Nothing el&s;e could have prevented him:
<PB N="77" REF="76">
for he and I always lived on terms of the mo&s;t
unre&s;erved and familiar intimacy.</P>
<P>ONE day, after all hope of recovery was gone,
he called for a particular parcel of his papers,
and, putting them in the hand of a Friend who
was &s;itting by him, de&s;ired that they might be
burned. His Friend di&s;&s;uaded it; but he repeat|ed
the reque&s;t, and &s;aid they contained nothing
of any value. There is rea&s;on to think, that he
did not then di&s;tinctly remember what papers
were in that parcel (which he had made up be|fore
he had any apprehen&s;ion of danger, and had
not &s;een for many months); and that on this oc|ca&s;ion
&s;ome things might have been de&s;troyed,
which perhaps he wi&s;hed to be pre&s;erved. I can|not
<PB N="78" REF="77">
otherwi&s;e account for the mutilated &s;tate in
which I find &s;ome of his be&s;t pieces.</P>
<P>I HAVE lo&s;t the plea&s;ante&s;t, and, for the la&s;t four
or five years of his &s;hort life, one of the mo&s;t in|&s;tructive,
companions, that ever man was delight|ed
with. But&mdash;THE LORD GAVE; THE LORD
HATH TAKEN AWAY: BLESSED BE THE NAME
OF THE LORD.&mdash;I adore the Author of all good,
who gave him grace to lead &s;uch a life, and die
&s;uch a death, as makes it impo&s;&s;ible for a Chri&s;|tain
to doubt of his having entered upon the in|heritance
of a happy immortality.</P>

POEM
ON THE
EXCELLENCE OF CHRISTIANITY.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>VIRTUE does not con&s;i&s;t in the repre&s;&s;ion of hope and de&s;ire, or in &s;urly ab&s;tinence from plea&s;ure and in&s;en&s;ibility to pain: it does, on the contrary, afford the only &s;uitable gratification to de|&s;ire, and confidence to hope; and produces the only pure and la|&s;ting enjoyment.&mdash;The&s;e happy ends will be attained, if our hopes and de&s;ires are fixed upon the improvement of the &s;oul, and ex|tended to the intere&s;ts of eternity.</P>
<P>THE Chri&s;tian Religion alone affords the means of this hap|pine&s;s: for it alone teaches how we may improve the be&s;t facul|ties of the &s;oul; and it can alone compo&s;e and gratify our hopes and de&s;ires, by a&s;&s;uring us of future felicity, and by removing that uncertainty and fear which the thought of eternal duration mu&s;t rai&s;e in every mind un&s;upported by the comforts of the Go&s;pel, and &s;en&s;ible of its own guilt and infirmity.</P>
<P>THOUGH no future life were to be expected, happine&s;s, even upon earth, could not be obtained, except from the mind. So that even a de&s;ire of pre&s;ent happine&s;s &s;hould make us obey the precepts of Chri&s;tianity; as directly tending to improve and harmonize the &s;oul, and to procure for us in this life all the feli|city whereof in this life our nature is capable.</P>
<P>THESE particulars I would attempt to explain, partly by argu|ment, and partly by examples. I do not wi&s;h to follow that &s;trict arrangement, which might be nece&s;&s;ary in a philo&s;ophical di&s;|cour&s;e; but rather to di&s;po&s;e the &s;ubject in &s;uch a manner as may be mo&s;t &s;uitable to the natural cour&s;e of human thought, may relieve the mind by variety in the &s;tyle, and may afford the be&s;t opportunities for poetical illu&s;tration.</P></NOTE>.</HEAD>

pro&s;perity, and ea&s;e; &s;upported by the applau&s;e of
literature, and the patronage of greatne&s;s; you
were kind to others, for others were kind to you.
My genius bloomed in a de&s;ert; and from that
de&s;ert it was not drawn, till the winter of life
had repre&s;&s;ed its vigour, and tarni&s;hed its beauty.
My days were &s;pent in &s;ickne&s;s and in &s;orrow; agi|tated
by fruitle&s;s hope, and chilled by unfore&s;een
di&s;appointment. That from this &s;everity of ex|ternal
circum&s;tances I might acquire a &s;everity of
external behaviour, why is it to be wondered? All
men have their infirmities, and I had mine. Yet
the&s;e con&s;equences of adver&s;ity did not contami|nate

virtues, which have &s;ecured my e&s;teem and reve|rence,
and will pre&s;erve to you the e&s;teem and re|verence
of all good men, let petty criticks nibble
at your character as they plea&s;e. I know too, that,
if there was a little peevi&s;hne&s;s in your writings
and conver&s;ation, it mu&s;t be attributed to bad for|tune,
and to no badne&s;s of heart: which made me
&s;peak &s;lightly of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages in the <HI>Rambler</HI>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHNSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>BUT you threatened to object to my &s;tyle: did
you not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ADDISON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I DID: I think it has too unwieldy and too uni|form
a dignity. In compo&s;ition even excellence
it&s;elf will tire, if continued without variety. And
your very be&s;t performances, from too free an u&s;e
of uncommon words, and from a con&s;tant endea|vour
at quaintne&s;s, antithe&s;is, and wit, are de&s;ti|tute
of that &s;implicity, without which there can
be no true elegance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHNSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>A VERY delicate ob&s;ervation indeed! and
from one at who&s;e hands I had a right to expect
<PB N="237" REF="229">
it! On whom have I lavi&s;hed the honours of lite|rary
applau&s;e more liberally than on you? Have
I not &s;aid, that &startq;whoever wi&s;hes to attain an En|gli&s;h
&s;tyle, familiar but not coar&s;e, and elegant
but not o&s;tentatious, mu&s;t give his days and his
nights to the volumes of Addi&s;on?&endq;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ADDISON.</SPEAKER>
<P>YOU have indeed be&s;towed on me greater prai&s;e
than I de&s;erve. But I can hardly think your
prai&s;es of my &s;tyle come from the heart, when I
&s;ee you &s;o unwilling to practi&s;e your&s;elf what you
recommend to others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHNSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>SIR, I am not accu&s;tomed to &s;peak but from the
heart; nor will I ever recommend to others what
I my&s;elf would not practi&s;e. I have laboured my
&s;tyle with the greate&s;t attention: I have endea|voured
to make it, as I wi&s;h it to be, clo&s;e with|out
obtenebration, per&s;picuous without languor,
and &s;trong without impetuo&s;ity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ADDISON.</SPEAKER>
<P>AND my greate&s;t objection to it is, that you
have laboured it too much; or, at lea&s;t, that its
<PB N="238" REF="230">
elaboratene&s;s is too apparent. It &s;avours more of
art than of nature, more of the midnight lamp
than of the pure radiance of noon; and in your
readers either produces inattention to the &s;en&s;e,
while they are occupied in con&s;idering the words
by which it is expre&s;&s;ed; or makes them doubt
the &s;incerity of one, who &s;eems le&s;s concerned
what he &s;hall &s;ay than how he &s;hall &s;ay it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHNSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>YOUR remarks are &s;pecious, Sir; they are &s;pe|cious;
but they are &s;pecious only. They are the
remarks of a man adapting rectitude to his own
practice, not forming his practice by the rule of
rectitude. And I will now declare, &s;ince you have
driven me to it, that though I think your compo|&s;ition
light and lively, and therefore recommend
it as a model to ordinary writers, I cannot help
ob&s;erving in it a colloquial imbecillity, to the
&s;tandard of which a man of energetick thought
could not, without danger of enervation, &s;ubject
him&s;elf. A man of genius, Sir, will di&s;play the
coru&s;cations, or rather the &s;teady lu&s;tre, of that
genius, equally by the manner and by the matter,
equally in his &s;entiments and in his diction</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="239" REF="231">
<SPEAKER>ADDISON.</SPEAKER>
<P>TO this I object not: but at the &s;ame time
I beg leave to &s;ay, that genius may be as much
&s;hown in &s;imple as in pompous writing. Artis e&s;t
celare artem. And, if you would hear me with
patience and impartiality I might perhaps con|vince
you, that it would not have been hurtful
to your compo&s;itions, if you had &s;oftened their
oratorical rigour with a little of that <HI>colloquial im|becillity</HI>
which you cen&s;ure in mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHNSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL, well; you &s;hall be heard with patience.
I mu&s;t allow that you po&s;&s;e&s;s a facility of expre&s;|&s;ion
which is not unplea&s;ant. You have a mind
well furni&s;hed with the &s;tores &s;ub&s;ervient to ele|gance
and utility; but your thoughts are in en|ergy
deficient, becau&s;e you are too little ambi|tious
of adding ornament to elucidation. You
have in you, Sir, too much of the playful and
pliant companion, and too little of the dignity of
an author.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ADDISON.</SPEAKER>
<P>THAT I take to be a great compliment. And
perhaps our pre&s;ent contrariety of opinion might
<PB N="240" REF="232">
make us mutually de&s;ire the conver&s;ation of each
other; &s;ince you are as willing to object, as I am
to be prai&s;ed; and &s;ince I receive as commenda|tion
what you &s;peak as cen&s;ure.&mdash;However, you
have allowed me to examine your notions of &s;tyle,
and I will not defer that topick any longer. You
will doubtle&s;s agree with me, that &s;peech was in|tended
to convey the &s;entiments of men from one
to another; and that, therefore, its fir&s;t and mo&s;t
e&s;&s;ential quality is, to be under&s;tood.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHNSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>YES: I admit that language mu&s;t be intelligi|ble;
and that it was fabricated as a vehicle for
human cogitation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ADDISON.</SPEAKER>
<P>SINCE, then, we agree in this, you will al&s;o al|low
that of two words having the &s;ame &s;ignifi|cation
an author ought to prefer the more intel|ligible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHNSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I might perhaps agree with you in general up|on
that point. But are there not words, &s;ullied
<PB N="241" REF="233">
by the mouth of the multitude, which from
meanne&s;s, or vulgarity, become un&s;uitable to the
maje&s;ty of compo&s;ition?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ADDISON.</SPEAKER>
<P>IF a word, conveying an idea with meanne&s;s
either inherent in it&s;elf or acquired by a&s;&s;ociation,
be compared with another word which conveys
the &s;ame idea without meanne&s;s, the &s;ignifications
of tho&s;e words are in &s;ome degree different, and
therefore they are not included in my propo&s;ition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHNSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>PERHAPS you may be right. But are there
not words, who&s;e venerable magnitude gives them
an elegance and a dignity &s;uperior to that of the
more diminutive parts of &s;peech? Cant words,
and vulgar words in general, are &s;hort. Your
friend Swift will tell you &s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ADDISON.</SPEAKER>
<P>YES: but he will not tell me, that &s;hort words
are always either cant, or vulgar.&mdash;I allow, that,
in certain circum&s;tances, even in pro&s;e, one word
may be preferable to another for the &s;ound only.
<PB N="242" REF="234">
But I can never admit, that &s;ound is more valu|able
than &s;en&s;e; or believe, that a reader, when
he meets with a word he does not under&s;tand,
will think his ignorance compen&s;ated by his di&s;|covering
that the word in que&s;tion con&s;i&s;ts of &s;ix
or &s;even &s;yllables, and ends with&mdash;<HI>ation</HI> or&mdash;<HI>o&s;i|ty.</HI>
If it were to be e&s;tabli&s;hed as a rule, that one
expre&s;&s;ion &s;hould be preferred to another for the
&s;ound merely, without its being con&s;idered whe|ther
common readers could under&s;tand it or not;
we might &s;oon expect to &s;ee the words <HI>an&s;wering</HI>
and <HI>noi&s;y</HI> bani&s;hed from our language, that their
place might be &s;upplied by the Greek <HI>Poluphloi&s;|bio</HI>
and <HI>Apameibomenos.</HI> I mu&s;t therefore maintain,
that one word is to be cho&s;en in preference to
another for the &s;ake of the <HI>&s;ound,</HI> only when the
&s;en&s;e is in both exactly the &s;ame, and in both e|qually
per&s;picuous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHNSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>AND I mu&s;t, I think, give my a&s;&s;ent to your for|mer
propo&s;ition thus limited and explained. But
&s;urely you do not mean to in&s;inuate, that an au|thor
mu&s;t u&s;e no word which cannot by the vul|gar
be under&s;tood.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="243" REF="235">
<SPEAKER>ADDISON.</SPEAKER>
<P>BY no means. I know that an author may
have occa&s;ion to mention many things that the
common people do not under&s;tand, and therefore
have not language to expre&s;s. But I &s;till think,
that he ought to prefer a word which the vulgar
can under&s;tand to one which they cannot, if it
convey the &s;ame meaning with equal elegance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHNSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;ee that you adhere to your rule, and will ob|lige
me to agree with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ADDISON.</SPEAKER>
<P>DO you then renounce <HI>fragility, &s;tentorophonick,
detruncation,</HI> and other unwieldy favourites, who&s;e
&s;en&s;e may be expre&s;&s;ed in plain Engli&s;h with e|qual
elegance and much greater per&s;picuity?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHNSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>SIR, Sir, you have a puerile mode of argumen|tation,
which you mu&s;t have learned by conver|&s;ing
with the <HI>rabble</HI> of London in your diurnal
papers: my periodical lucubrations had a loftier
aim. Make me a &s;peech to confirm your doctrine,
<PB N="244" REF="236">
and I will confute it; write me a &s;y&s;tem, and it
&s;hall be overturned; but do not hara&s;s me with the
a&s;&s;iduous importunity of que&s;tion and inference,
as if you were putting interrogatories to a &s;chool-boy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ADDISON.</SPEAKER>
<P>IF my arguments are ju&s;t, do not reject them
as childi&s;h; and remember your promi&s;e, that
you would hear me with impartiality and pa|tience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHNSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL: perhaps I may be inclined to allow,
that my diction might have been improved in
intelligibility, by the removal of &s;uch words as
tho&s;e you object to. But where then would have
been the cadence of my periods, the pomp of my
&s;onorous phra&s;eology, the&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ADDISON.</SPEAKER>
<P>YOU agreed with me, that in &s;tyle per&s;picuity
is the fir&s;t thing to be con&s;idered; and that it is
to be embelli&s;hed by attention to the &s;ound, only
when that can be done without injury to the &s;en&s;e.
But, even with regard to &s;ound,&mdash;do you think,
that Virgil would have been accounted an har|monious
<PB N="245" REF="237">
poet, if he had continued through the
whole Eneid that &s;train of ver&s;ification, however
elegant and &s;ublime, in which he de&s;cribes the
&s;torm in his fir&s;t book; or that Homer would have
been, in your opinion, to be commended, if he
had related the meeting of Penelope and Uly&s;&s;es,
or the parting of Hector and Andromache, with
the &s;ame thundering impetuo&s;ity of numbers,
which he employs upon the &s;tone of Si&s;yphus, or
the hor&s;es and chariot of Neptune?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHNSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>NO: I allow, that harmony of &s;tyle is merely
relative, and de&s;erves prai&s;e only when it &s;uits the
&s;ubject; and that the &s;ame &s;train of eloquence, if
too long continued, induces languor from its want
of diver&s;ification, as well as di&s;placency from the
appearance of exce&s;&s;ive art.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ADDISON.</SPEAKER>
<P>IS it your opinion, then, that the pompous uni|formity
of diction, which we find in the <HI>Rambler,</HI>
can plea&s;e by its variety; or that it can be adapt|ed
to each different &s;ubject, when it is equally ap|plied
to all:&mdash;to the trifling as well as the mag|nificent,
to prai&s;e and to cen&s;ure, to argument and
<PB N="246" REF="238">
to narrative? Do you not think, that the &s;ame ob|jections
may be made to the &s;tructure of your
&s;tyle, as to the &s;ound; if both ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s,
what you have given to neither, variety &s;uited to
the &s;ubject? And would not one be apt to ima|gine,
that an author, who, by the &s;ound and com|po&s;ition
of his language, elevates equally &s;ublime
and familiar ideas, might run &s;ome ri&s;que of fal|ling
under the imputation of bomba&s;t?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHNSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>SIR, you grow intolerable:&mdash;but when were whigs
otherwi&s;e! You &s;till forget that you are not now
engaged in di&s;qui&s;ition with one of the populace
of London. Yet I would not have you imagine,
that &s;uch arguments can affect or change my
mind. No, Sir, if I cea&s;e to an&s;wer, it is more
from la&s;&s;itude than from conviction<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Though John&s;on appears to &s;ome di&s;advantage in this Dia|logue, it is but ju&s;t to remark, that the Author held in high ve|neration the genius, virtues, and learning of that great man; with whom he had the honour to be acquainted.</NOTE>.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>AND yet my arguments are not, in my judge|ment,
either tedious or inconclu&s;ive. But you

you too well to entertain any <HI>&s;erious</HI> doubt of

I am &s;omewhat apprehen&s;ive, that you might, on

as well as partiality. Have not many writers, in|&s;tead

<SPEAKER>JOHNSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>SIR, if I were &s;till relaxed by the imbecillity,
or agitated with the pa&s;&s;ions, of mortal life, I
might an&s;wer your folly with the &s;everity it de|&s;erves.
Had tho&s;e biographers been able to in|jure
my character, they dur&s;t not; had they dared,
they were not able. My infirmities I have ever
acknowledged, and with humility and regret I
&s;till acknowledge. My abilities, &s;urely, did not
make me the object of contempt, or my virtues
of abhorrence; either, I hope, I did not over|rate:
I have endeavoured fairly to e&s;timate, and
<PB N="251" REF="243">
candidly to declare my excellencies (if any thing
human may be &s;o called) and my defects. Of
both the&s;e, to him who would di&s;tingui&s;h him|&s;elf,
or improve others, the knowledge is nece&s;|&s;ary:
of his defects, that confidence may not
&s;well into pride; of his excellencies, that the mo|de&s;ty
of di&s;tru&s;t may not &s;hrink into the torpor
of timidity. If I was &s;ubject to the frailties of
humanity, what does it prove, but that I was a
man? If I recommended, by the &s;ubtlety of ar|gument,
if I &s;upported, by the impudence of ex|ample,
if I decorated with the &s;plendour of wit,
or enforced by vehemence of declamation, doc|trines
ho&s;tile to religion and to goodne&s;s, brand
me with all the infamy that language can expre&s;s
or malevolence contrive: but if my ability,
&s;uch as it was, I exerted in the defence of virtue
and the di&s;com&s;iture of vice, I apprehend no dan|ger
from the a&s;&s;iduity and eloquence, either of
you, Sir, or of my biographers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>AND yet, before I left the upper world, no few|er
than three volumes had been publi&s;hed con|cerning
your &s;entiments and behaviour; which
volumes, as &s;everal people of fa&s;hion have a&s;&s;ured
<PB N="252" REF="244">
me, can do little credit to your principles and
candour, in the opinion of the pre&s;ent age or of
po&s;terity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHNSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>YES, Sir, I have been told, I &s;hall not &s;ay by
people of fa&s;hion, but I will &s;ay by per&s;ons of ve|racity,
that &s;ome writers have been very indu&s;|trious
to record Anecdotes of John&s;on; and to
repre&s;ent as &s;erious and &s;olemn philo&s;ophy what
I might have retorted ha&s;tily, in the moment of
fretfulne&s;s, perhaps under the pre&s;&s;ure of di&s;ea&s;e,
or ironically hinted in the confidence of playful
conver&s;ation. This is an age, Sir, of ignorance
and loquacity; all are very willing to talk, and
almo&s;t all are very unable to think; and they
who have nothing to &s;ay of their own, are glad
to &s;ay &s;omething that has been &s;aid by others.
Thus my &s;ayings have been inquired after with
curio&s;ity, and collected with avidity. The pre|ference
u&s;ually given of obloquy to prai&s;e may be
unplea&s;ant, but is not unaccountable: what was
mo&s;t agreeable to the biographer him&s;elf, and
what he knew would be mo&s;t agreeable to his
readers, he readily ob&s;erved, was careful to re|member,
and willingly told; and the har&s;h fea|tures
<PB N="253" REF="245">
of my character became mo&s;t remarkable;
not becau&s;e they were the mo&s;t numerous; but
becau&s;e, being &s;omewhat prominent, they were
by the firebrand of malicious inquiry mo&s;t &s;trong|ly
illuminated. No man of &s;en&s;e needs be told,
that of the little railleries, which give flavour and
poignancy to familiar conver&s;ation, more mu&s;t be
judged from the manner in which they are deli|vered,
than from the words: the latter my bio|graphers
have been &s;tudious to record; the for|mer
they have been no le&s;s &s;tudious to conceal,
or perhaps they had not &s;kill to exhibit.&mdash;But,
let the rabble, both &s;mall and great, affix to the
words Samuel John&s;on any idea they plea&s;e; of
&s;uch I &s;corn alike the applau&s;e and the di&s;appro|bation.
I &s;eek the prai&s;e of the good, the judi|cious,
and the learned; and he who has prudence,
crudition, or charity, mu&s;t be willing to gather
my principles rather from what I have written,
than from the prattle of a go&s;&s;ip; who is more
anxious that a &s;tory be entertaining, than that it
be true; who&s;e ob&s;ervation may be erroneous, and
who&s;e narrative may of cour&s;e be imperfect.
From the &s;entiments of po&s;terity I have little ap|phrehen&s;ion.
I tru&s;t my writings will be read and

of my character; although I may have good rea|&s;on
to di&s;tru&s;t &s;ome of tho&s;e who have under|taken
to de&s;cribe and analy&s;e it: a per&s;on of inte|grity
and innocence &s;ubmits reluctantly his cau&s;e
to the care of an ignorant pettifogger, and the
verdict of a temerarious jury. That man will
not write paltry tales, who can write any thing
better; and he who can write nothing better will
write nothing good. Anecdote is but a &s;mall
part of the materials from which the careful hi&s;|torian
collects a character: he who is able to rear
the edifice will not employ him&s;elf in compound|ing
the mortar. * * * * *</P>

<P>COME hither, Socrates; I wi&s;h to introduce
you to a modern Briti&s;h Philo&s;opher.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>ALTHOUGH I never made great preten&s;ions to
philo&s;ophy my&s;elf, I have always reckoned the
acquaintance of true philo&s;ophers a mo&s;t valuable
acqui&s;ition; and left the world without regret,
<PB N="256" REF="248">
in the hope of enjoying in the&s;e regions the com|pany
and conver&s;ation of the wi&s;e men of anti|quity.
Where is the per&s;on, pray, with whom
you mean to make me acquainted?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MERCURY.</SPEAKER>
<P>LOOK towards the Styx. Do you &s;ee a tall fat
man, very &s;plendidly dre&s;t, coming this way,
with a little hat under his arm? He is the philo|&s;opher.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>THAT from his dre&s;s I &s;hould hardly have
concluded. But I do not blame him for comply|ing
with the fa&s;hion of his age and country, as
far as might be requi&s;ite to prevent the appear|ance
of &s;ingularity. No: I &s;hall love and e&s;teem
him as a philo&s;opher, that is, as a friend to truth
and virtue: the &s;hape of his coat, or the twi&s;t of
his periwig, do not affect my opinion. And of
what &s;cience has he extended the boundaries?
With what new di&s;covery has he enriched man|kind?
Or has he been &s;ucce&s;sful in illu&s;trating
the doctrines of morality e&s;tabli&s;hed by others?
His countrymen, I am told, have of late made
con&s;iderable advances in the knowledge of, what
<PB N="257" REF="249">
was little known in my time, the properties of
matter, and the laws of a&s;tronomy: has he em|ployed
him&s;elf in that way?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MERCURY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not that he has.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>HE may, no doubt, have enquired into the na|ture
of the human mind; &s;trengthened by new
arguments the cau&s;e of virtue; or e&s;tabli&s;hed on
a firmer foundation the liberties of his country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MERCURY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am afraid he has not enlarged the philo&s;ophy
of the human mind by new ob&s;ervations, or by
the advancement of truth; nay I doubt whether
he believed that there is &s;uch a thing as mind in
the univer&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>A geometrician perhaps?</P>

<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>MANY &s;ciences may have been brought to per|fection
&s;ince I left my native planet, and much
wonderful di&s;covery has actually been made.
Pray tell me, good Mercury, in what re&s;pect he
has extended knowledge, or confirmed belief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MERCURY.</SPEAKER>
<P>TRULY, I am at a lo&s;s to &s;ay, in what he has
confirmed belief;&mdash;unle&s;s you call a confirma|tion
of belief his endeavours to make man|kind
doubt of every thing; of the exi&s;tence of
Cod, of &s;pirit, of matter, and even of them|&s;elves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>SO&mdash;I find the gentleman is only a &s;ceptick.
That is a character, with which the world was not
unacquainted in my days. But I wonder that the
Britons, who have rid their country of a far le&s;s
pernicious animal the wolf, would &s;uffer a &s;cep|tick
to burrow among them. And do you call
&s;uch a per&s;on a philo&s;opher, Mercury.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="259" REF="251">
<SPEAKER>MERCURY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I ONLY call him what he has been called by
others. You have had occa&s;ion to pre&s;cribe, be|fore
now, for &s;ceptici&s;m: and I &s;hould think it a
favour, if you would purge this poor &s;oul of a
part at lea&s;t of the corruption he has brought up|on
him&s;elf. He might perhaps think it a favour
too; for if he be not purified in that way, he
mu&s;t in another le&s;s agreeable.&mdash;But he is almo&s;t
come up to us. Now, my good old Grecian, arm
your&s;elf with all your philo&s;ophy, &s;et in order
your arguments, prepare your illu&s;trations, &s;harp|en
your logical weapons; call forth the plea&s;ant|ry
of your wit, the fire of your imagination, the
impetuo&s;ity of your eloquence, the keenne&s;s of
your&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>SOFTLY, &s;oftly, my friend. You know I was
never di&s;tingui&s;hed as a declaimer: I have al|ways
thought it &s;ufficient to convince a man,
without either deafening or frightening him. I
would rather allure than compel; for there is in
human nature a &s;trong propen&s;ity to re&s;i&s;t vio|lence,
<PB N="260" REF="252">
and not a le&s;s &s;trong one to yield to gentle
per&s;ua&s;ion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MERCURY.</SPEAKER>
<P>SHALL I then introduce him to you as the re|nowned
Socrates, the champion of virtue, come,
not to force, but to &s;ooth him into the truth?
Do you think that an ob&s;tinate mind, which will
not yield to a greater power, may be &s;ubdued by
a le&s;s?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>MENTION neither my name nor my character.
I would rather on this, as on former occa&s;ions,
appear a plain man than a philo&s;opher, and &s;eem
more to favour &s;ceptici&s;m than to oppo&s;e it: for
&s;o he will hear me without apprehen&s;ion or unea&s;i|ne&s;s;
and I may give my opinion of &s;ome of his
tenets, without being &s;u&s;pected of any de&s;ign ei|ther
to confute or to ridicule them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MERCURY.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL: you &s;hall be obeyed. But he is here.
&mdash;Great and learned Sir, I beg leave to introduce
to you this friend of mine, a plain man, who pre|tends
not to philo&s;ophy or literature, but has
with &s;ome attention read your E&s;&s;ays.&mdash;Friend
<PB N="261" REF="253">
<STAGE>[turning to Socrates]</STAGE> this is the extraordinary per|&s;on,
whom you have &s;o often expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire to
&s;ee: this is the philo&s;opher, who&s;e writings are
&s;o much admired in Europe, A&s;ia, Africa and A|merica;
whom many read, few under&s;tand, and
all are convinced by.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>I AM happy in being pre&s;ented to &s;o great a
per&s;on. That many read his writings, and that
few under&s;tand them, I can readily &s;uppo&s;e: but
give me leave to doubt, whether by them any one
was ever convinced.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODERN PHILOSOPHER.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Sdeath, Sir;&mdash;nobody convinced by my philo|&s;ophical
writings!&mdash;What do you mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>FAR be it from me, Sir, to &s;ay that. God for|bid&mdash;no,
I am wrong, I a&s;k <HI>your</HI> pardon, Sir.&mdash;Chance
forbid&mdash;p&s;haw! I am wrong again. Ne|ce&s;&s;ity
forbid&mdash;or Nothing forbid, that I &s;hould
affirm any thing, or nothing, &s;o po&s;itively. I on|ly
&s;aid, that I <HI>doubted</HI> whether any body was ever
convinced by them. And let me tell you, Sir,
<PB N="262" REF="254">
that you are a particular &s;ort of a gentleman, and
that your principles agree very ill with your prac|tice,
if you do not very much doubt the &s;ame
thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>O SIR, I thought you wi&s;hed me to talk in the
language of common life. Why, philo&s;ophically
&s;peaking, you are right; I doubt whether my
writings ever did convince; I doubt, whether
they were ever publi&s;hed or printed:&mdash;O yes,
without doubt, Sir, I doubt very much&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>BUT &s;urely, now, that theory of yours cannot
be well founded. Is it po&s;&s;ible, that you &s;hould,
with &s;erious confidence, doubt whether your wri|tings
ever gave conviction, or ever appeared in
print?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>BUT I tell you, Sir, that I doubt of it, with as
great certainty, as I believe,&mdash;no, I mean as I
doubt, my own exi&s;tence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRAES.</SPEAKER>
<P>YOU firmly believe that you doubt it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="263" REF="255">
<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>YES, Sir; and any one who has read my E&s;&s;ays
will firmly, if he is a real philo&s;opher, believe
that he doubts the &s;ame thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>AND pray, do you think it more favours the
principle of univer&s;al &s;ceptici&s;m to believe that
you doubt, than to believe that you do not doubt?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>I TELL you, that you know nothing of the mat|ter&mdash;And,
to be &s;ure I do doubts, whether my be|lief
in my doubts be real or not. This I mu&s;t do
according to my principles: for I have &s;aid, <HI>ip&s;e
dixi,</HI> that a true philo&s;opher is doubtful of his
doubts, as well as of his convictions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>YOU do not, by your principles, believe any
thing, do you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>BY no means: as a philo&s;opher I believe noth|ing
certainly; and have &s;aid, that he who believes
<PB N="264" REF="256">
any thing certainly is a fool. The phra&s;e, you
may think, has not the highe&s;t poli&s;h of Pari&s;ian
civility; but of my <HI>friends</HI> not one ever objected
to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>YOU &s;eemed to think, that confirmed doubt
implies belief; implies your believing that you
are doubtful.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>YES; I allow that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>THEN you can neither believe any thing, nor
doubt any thing; as the former &s;uppo&s;es belief
directly, and the latter by implication. So that
your mind can never be employed on any thought
at all; for, if it were, that would imply &s;ome|thing
either of belief or of doubt with re&s;pect to
the thought, or with re&s;pect to the manner of
your thinking of it. But you allow, that doubt
implies believing that you are doubtful. There|fore
you cannot think without believing: and as,
according to your principles, you cannot believe,
&s;o neither, according to your principles, can you
think.</P>

<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>I TELL you, old gentleman, you know nothing

impertinent, ill-bred&mdash;</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MERCURY.</SPEAKER>
<P>PARDON my interrupting you, good Sir. But,
I mu&s;t now take the liberty to inform you, that
you are &s;peaking to one nearly equal, perhaps, in
philo&s;ophy, even to your&s;elf. I mu&s;t al&s;o tell you,
as you are a &s;tranger to our cu&s;toms, that it will
not be for your intere&s;t to maintain any doctrine
<HI>here</HI> which you do not believe: for if &s;uch no|tions
cannot be driven out by the conver&s;ation of
Socrates, it may be tried whether they will re|&s;i&s;t&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>SOCRATES, Sir, is a per&s;on for whom I mu&s;t be
underdood to have a very great re&s;pect: it is
fa&s;hionable in the be&s;t company to &s;peak of him
re&s;pectfully. When I was in Paris, they called
me (and my friends in&mdash;politely re-echoed
the words) <HI>Le Socrate moderne.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="266" REF="258">
<SPEAKER>MERCURY.</SPEAKER>
<P>VERY likely: but that is not to the pre&s;ent pur|po&s;e.
Proceed, if you plea&s;e, in the argument
with Socrates.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>I DENY not, that, from what he has &s;aid, it ap|pears
plain enough, that if mind did exi&s;t, adn
could employ it&s;elf in thinking, the fir&s;t princi|ples
of inve&s;tigation mu&s;t be founded in belief.
But as I deny the exi&s;tence of mind, and con&s;e|quently
of thought, it is not nece&s;&s;ary for me to
allow, that his rea&s;oning affects my theory. The
mind, although it mu&s;t believe if it think, yet, if
it do not think, may as well doubt. Such is my
doctrine: and I am proud to declare, that, while
I was on earth, there were &s;ome who &s;tudied, and
many who embraced it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>THAT I am willing to believe. Even in your own
hou&s;e I doubt not that you mu&s;t have had many
di&s;ciples. Every chair in your parlour would
have a &s;mattering at lea&s;t of knowledge in human
nature: and the table on which you wrote your
<PB N="267" REF="259">
E&s;&s;ays might di&s;cu&s;s a point of &s;ceptici&s;m not
much le&s;s accurately than your&s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>FIE, Socrates; it is beneath the dignity of a
philo&s;opher to talk &s;o ab&s;urdly. What a jumble
of incon&s;i&s;tencies have you thrown together! Did
I ever hint, or could I ever believe, that a table
or chair could rea&s;on like my&s;elf; or &s;uppo&s;e a
piece of in&s;en&s;ible matter to be endowed with hu|man
faculties?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>BEFORE I give you an an&s;wer, allow me to a&s;k
you a plain que&s;tion with regard to <HI>nothing;</HI> that
idea, or rather word, which you &s;eem to be &s;o fond
of. Is not <HI>nothing,</HI> with re&s;pect to matter, for ex|ample,
de&s;titute of the qualities of magnitude and
&s;olidity, which are e&s;&s;ential to matter? And, with
regard to mind, is it not de&s;titute of all the quali|ties
of mind?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>I DO not well under&s;tand the&s;e que&s;tions; but
I admit at once, that a non-entity cannot po&s;&s;e&s;s
qualities.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="268" REF="260">
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>AND what is your idea of <HI>difference?</HI> Would
you call two things different, which both po&s;&s;e&s;s
the &s;ame qualities?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>BY no means. When two things are &s;poken of
as different, it mu&s;t be meant, that one of them
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;ome quality which the other does not
po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL: if you and your table be different, mu&s;t
not one of the two have &s;ome quality or qualities
that the other has not? And &s;ince <HI>nothing</HI> cannot
po&s;&s;e&s;s any quality; and &s;ince both you and your
table are (by your theory) nothing; neither of
the two can po&s;&s;e&s;s any quality. So that when
you deny the exi&s;tence of matter and &s;pirit, you
in fact allow, that the &s;ame thing at the &s;ame time
does po&s;&s;e&s;s qualities, and does not po&s;&s;e&s;s quali|ties.
And you will find, that this is not the only
in&s;tance of &s;uch ab&s;urdity in &s;ceptical rea&s;oning:
you will find, that in almo&s;t all the principles of
<PB N="269" REF="261">
your &s;y&s;tem, as far as it is &s;ceptical, &s;imilar con|tradictions
are implied.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>THERE does appear to be a little ab&s;urdity in
&s;uppo&s;ing that &s;pirit and matter do not exi&s;t; as
they are evidently different, and therefore mu&s;t
po&s;&s;e&s;s qualities. But&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>AND you &s;eemed to allow, that, if the &s;oul
exi&s;t, univer&s;al &s;ceptici&s;m is impo&s;&s;ible, becau&s;e
this implies a nece&s;&s;ary want of all thought; which
is incon&s;i&s;tent with the nature of the &s;oul.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>PERHAPS from what has been &s;aid, the exi&s;tence
of the &s;oul, and the impo&s;&s;ibility of univer&s;al &s;cepti|ci&s;m,
might appear &s;ufficiently certain to the com|mon
herd of mankind. But you are not aware,
my good Sir, that I hold one tenet, which totally
de&s;troys the force of every argument. I hold,
that the &s;en&s;es and the memory are fallacious; and
that, by con&s;equence, one cannot be &s;ure of the
reality of what one perceives or remembers. So
that we ought not by any rea&s;oning to be con|vinced,
<PB N="270" REF="262">
as we are apt both to mi&s;under&s;tand and
to forget it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>IT is &s;trange if you do not &s;ee that, in this re&s;|pect,
your own arguments are liable to the &s;ame
objection with tho&s;e of your opponents.&mdash;But, pa&s;|&s;ing
this; what rea&s;on have you to think that the
&s;en&s;es are deceitful?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>LET me an&s;wer you by another que&s;tion. Have
not mankind in general agreed to call the faculty
perceiving, the object perceived, and the act of
perception, by one and the &s;ame name?&mdash;thereby
indicating, that tho&s;e three are, according to po|pular
opinion, really the &s;ame thing. Now the
<HI>faculty perceiving</HI> is in what we call the &s;oul or
mind; as when one &s;ays, my <HI>&s;ight</HI> is weak: &s;o
likewi&s;e mu&s;t the <HI>thing perceived</HI> be; as when one
&s;ays, I &s;ee a &s;trange <HI>&s;ight:</HI> and therefore the &s;en&s;es
give knowledge of no things external to the mind
but of &s;uch things only as are contained by it,
or within it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>AND can you really think, that men in general,
when they &s;ee a river or a mountain, believe it to
<PB N="271" REF="263">
exi&s;t only in their own mind? Bring me one man
of common &s;en&s;e who thinks &s;o, and I &s;ubmit to
your opinion. But you will not find, that man|kind
never employ the &s;ame word to denote things
which they believe to be totally different.&mdash;When
you look at London from Highgate hill, have
you not a <HI>view</HI> of London?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>YES.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>NO doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>DOES it follow, that London and the per&s;pec|tive
repre&s;entation of it are the &s;ame thing; or
that, while you have the drawing in your pocket,
you have the city in your pocket too?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>NO: I own there is &s;ome rea&s;on in what you
&s;ay.&mdash;But though I were to admit that the &s;en&s;es
are not deceitful, which no &s;ceptical philo&s;opher
ever did or can admit, I mu&s;t &s;till adhere to the
<PB N="272" REF="264">
fallacious nature of memory; which is alone &s;uf|ficient
to overturn every argument: for if we are
not certain that the premi&s;es are as our memory
repre&s;ents them, how can we be &s;ure of our con|clu&s;ion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>PLEASE to an&s;wer me a que&s;tion or two. If a
thou&s;and men were to ob&s;erve the &s;ame thing at
the &s;ame time, and every one of the thou&s;and, &s;e|parately
examined, to give the &s;ame account of
it; would it be a proof of the accuracy of their
ob&s;ervation, or of its inaccuracy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>OF its accuracy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>IF a thou&s;and men were to remember the &s;ame
thing with the &s;ame circum&s;tances; would it be
a proof of the exactne&s;s, or of the deceitfulne&s;s,
of memory?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>OF its exactne&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>AND among the many thou&s;ands who have
read and attended to hi&s;tory, is there, do you
think, any per&s;on of a &s;ound mind, who would
<PB N="273" REF="265">
differ from the re&s;t in his remembrance of the
mo&s;t material and undi&s;puted events that hi&s;to|rians

<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>TAKE the trouble to recollect what has been

the memory can with any propriety be called fal|lacious;

be reckoned a ju&s;t one. You allowed, that &s;pirit

of exi&s;tence; and that, the exi&s;tence of

<P>I HEARTILY wi&s;h you could. How would you

<P>YOU have certainly not only forgotten your

Why, that would be proving a propo&s;ition from

<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>AND is this contradiction more glaring than to
deduce <HI>univer&s;al &s;ceptici&s;m</HI> from any principle of
<HI>belief</HI> whatever. Let the principle be what it will,
either that Spirit and Matter do, or do not, exi&s;t;
&s;till belief is implied: and to prove, from a prin|ciple
believed, that we can believe nothing, is not
in my opinion le&s;s ridiculous, than to prove that
you are in the other world, becau&s;e you are in
this. You allowed that &s;pirit and matter have
<PB N="276" REF="268">

<P>I FEAR my &s;y&s;tem mu&s;t fall to pieces. But is

the mind of man &s;o light and ea&s;y, by relieving
it from all apprehen&s;ions of future exi&s;tence?</P>

<P>YOU &s;till forget where you are: you cannot, it
&s;eems, even in this world, keep clear of the licen|tious
jargon to which you were &s;o long accu&s;tom|ed
in the other. As to the tendency of your doc|trines,
and of the inferences that may be fairly
drawn from them,&mdash;no per&s;on capable of &s;erious
thought can for a moment believe them to be be|neficial
to mankind: you your&s;elf will be of this
opinion &s;oon, if you are not &s;o already. All love
to God, to our neighbour, and even to our&s;elves,
they would extingui&s;h; for who can love that
which he does not believe to exi&s;t! From no &s;ort
of wickedne&s;s, that man may wi&s;h to commit,
<PB N="277" REF="269">
would they deter: for they teach, that rea&s;on
ought to be the &s;ervant, or rather the &s;lave, of
pa&s;&s;ion; and that the impul&s;es of pa&s;&s;ion, being
the nece&s;&s;ary effects of nece&s;&s;ary cau&s;es, are irre|&s;i&s;table,
and therefore need not be re&s;i&s;ted: that
there is no good rea&s;on for di&s;tingui&s;hing moral
virtue from intellectual ability; in other words,
that men are under no &s;tronger obligations to be
ju&s;t than to be eloquent, and that to have a weak
memory is as bad a thing as to pick a pocket.
But I &s;corn to enter into the detail of your para|doxes.
I &s;hall only &s;ay, that they are not adapted
to the head or heart of any one who is not both
a profligate and a fool: and that you, by endea|vouring
to &s;ubvert every thing that has been be|lieved
concerning <HI>mind,</HI> have done &s;uch a &s;ervice

If you would <HI>be agreeable</HI> to hear, I would give

though a German by birth, he mu&s;t have kept the

him in the very lowe&s;t <HI>ebb</HI> of di&s;tre&s;s. His

the lady not quite &s;o forward as he wi&s;hed,
he left her in a rage, blew his brains out with a

<P>CERTAINLY. Why did Addi&s;on and I and

that, think you, if we had imagined that, in &s;o

them to disfigure the language, and by &s;o do|ing
to di&s;credit the literature, of England? Not
&s;urely the mo&s;t re&s;pectable part of the communi|ty.
Men of true learning and good judgement
are anxious to pre&s;erve the purity of language.
Tho&s;e barbarous idioms I take to be the manufac|ture

el&s;e. That a thing is new, is now a &s;ufficient re|commendation,
however inconvenient it may be,
however unnatural and un&s;eemly: nay the more
unnatural it is, the better chance it has of coming
into fa&s;hion. On the Briti&s;h &s;tage, with infinite ap|plau&s;e,
young and beautiful actre&s;&s;es perform &s;ome|times
the parts of highwaymen; and &s;ome &s;inging
actors &s;quall in an affected voice re&s;embling, and
intended to imitate, that of women: the mo&s;t
humourous dramatick pieces are frittered away
into &s;ongs: and I &s;hould not be &s;urpri&s;ed to hear,
that henceforth Miranda and Juliet are to be per|&s;onated
by grim-vi&s;aged grenadiers &s;even feet high,
and Fal&s;taff by a &s;lender mi&s;s ju&s;t entered in her
teens; that Hot&s;pur and Henry of Monmouth

I congratulate my country and the age I live
in, that literary patrioti&s;m is not extingui&s;hed;
and that &s;ome noble efforts have of late been made,
di&s;covering to the curious philologi&s;t unbounded
regions of compari&s;on and conjecture. The con|junction
<HI>if</HI> is at la&s;t referred to <HI>giving;</HI> and its equi|valant
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> (<HI>ei</HI>) derived from <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> (<HI>cimi</HI>) and <HI>&s;i</HI> from <HI>&s;um.</HI>
The prepo&s;ition <HI>ad,</HI> and <HI>at</HI> the disjunctive, are no
longer different words, but the &s;ame word; <HI>to</HI> and
<HI>too</HI> coale&s;ce in like manner: not to mention other
conjunctions, which are now found to &s;ignify a
che&s;t, perhaps, or pa&s;&s;age, or pantry door. A great
part of the rea&s;oning, which led to &s;uch valuable
di&s;coveries, is indeed &s;o brief and &s;imple, that, as
happens with regard to mo&s;t di&s;coveries truly va|luable,
I often wonder that I did not hit upon it
my&s;elf. But, in this &s;ubject, I am re&s;olved to de|&s;erve
the prai&s;e of doing well, though I cannot
pretend to be the fir&s;t who has done &s;o. Uncul|tivated
&s;cience is like an uncultivated country;
where to walk fir&s;t may be mo&s;t honourable, but
where to follow is often as profitable, and always
more &s;afe.</P>
<P>OF the journey, however, there is one part, in
which I no more conde&s;cend to be a follower; but
<PB N="301" REF="293">
with that noble ambition, which I flatter my&s;elf
is no ambiguous characteri&s;tick of a great mind,
have dared even to out&s;trip my guides. It has
been proved by learned men, that <HI>ad</HI> and <HI>at</HI> of
the Latins, and the Engli&s;h <HI>to</HI> and <HI>too,</HI> are &s;everal|ly
equivalent. I go further. I not only compare
tho&s;e particles among them&s;elves, but apply them
to the invariable &s;tandard of nature; and hope to
prove that the Engli&s;h <HI>to</HI> is &s;ynonymous not only
with <HI>too,</HI> but with <HI>toe</HI> in like manner; from which
I &s;hall &s;how that its origin is derived, and to
which all its &s;ignifications refer. The corre&s;pon|dent
Greek and Latin particles I &s;hall allude to
as far only as they may &s;erve to illu&s;trate this
main point. For of my di&s;coveries though I am
not &s;elfi&s;h enough to de&s;ire that the advantage
&s;hould be with-held from other languages and na|tions,

and honour.</P>
<P>PERSONS unaccu&s;tomed to the more recondite
&s;orts of grammatical di&s;qui&s;ition will perhaps think
my rea&s;oning in &s;ome particulars far-fetched and
minute. To &s;uch I &s;hall only &s;ugge&s;t the exam|ple

nobly replied, &startq;<HI>homo</HI> &s;um, <HI>humani</HI> nihil a me alie|num

think nothing foreign from my &s;peculations
which regards even a letter.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t part of my &s;ubject, in which the
dignity of the foot and toe, and their con&s;equent

women of China (a country which in &s;everal di&s;|coveries
has got the &s;tart of Europe) contract and
fa&s;hion the feet of their daughters. Nor need I
expatiate on the wi&s;dom of the ancient Romans,
who di&s;tingui&s;hed their great men from the vul|gar,
not by &s;tars, garters, or ribbons, but by
boots:<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Hor. Sat. VI. 27.</NOTE> far le&s;s will I pollute my page with the
modern foppery of buckles and ro&s;e-knots; or of
&s;hoes, which now can hardly contain the feet, but
which were formerly in this nation &s;o unwieldy,
that it was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport their points by a
&s;tring from the knee. Nor &s;hall I examine the
<PB N="303" REF="295">
theory of dancing; an art with which the honour
of the feet is intimately connected, and which the
&s;enate and people of Rome held in &s;uch reverence,
that except in religious &s;ervice they did not &s;uffer
it to appear: an art, however, much practi&s;ed by
the Greeks; who enjoined it by law, di&s;played it
in their mo&s;t &s;olemn exhibitions, and adorned it
with their noble&s;t poetry: an art every where re|commended
by the powerful voice of nature; but,
alas! who&s;e martial and maje&s;tick dignity died
with that prince of Grammarians Scaliger, who
was the la&s;t man that capered in the true <HI>pyrrick</HI>
of the antients.</P>
<P>REMEMBER, I be&s;eech you, what di&s;tingui&s;hed
reverence, according to the laws of antient ho&s;pi|tality,
which were not cramped with feudal &s;er|vitude
or finical affectation, was invariably paid
to the feet. Fair ladies and princes a&s;&s;i&s;ted at
wa&s;hing the feet of the pilgrim; an honour &s;el|dom
or never offered to the hands or face. Even
we, in the&s;e days of degeneracy, while we ki&s;s the
cheek of our friend, or the hand of our &s;overeign,
&s;alute, in te&s;timony of more profound veneration,
the great toe of the pope. Even we <HI>tread,</HI> or talk
at lea&s;t of <HI>treading,</HI> the paths of virtue: and while
<PB N="304" REF="296">
by <HI>unhandine&s;s</HI> we denote but a trifling and cura|ble
inadvertency, be&s;tow the appellation of a <HI>fal&s;e
&s;tep</HI> on crimes irreparable and unpardonable.</P>
<P>I MUST not omit to mention a well-known fact;
that men, who in puni&s;hing an equal would &s;trike
with the fi&s;t, avenge them&s;elves of an inferiour by
a kick with the toe: a proof, that with this organ
are a&s;&s;ociated ideas of authority and independence
which to the fi&s;t do not belong. The heroes of
Homer, too, while in&s;ulting a vanqui&s;hed enemy,
pre&s;s him, as the poet &s;ays, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, with the foot or
heel: and Virgil po&s;itively affirms, that Turnus,
having &s;lain the gallant youth Pallas, pre&s;&s;ed him
with the left foot. <HI>Laevo pre&s;&s;it pede</HI> are the words:
and I would recommend it to tho&s;e, who reject in
this particular the authority of Virgil, to con&s;ider
their own &s;tength; or, as another great author
has it,&mdash;Quid ferre recu&s;ent, quid valeant humeri;
le&s;t they &s;hould be as unequally matched with the
illu&s;trious poet of Mantua, as Evander's &s;on was
with the valiant though un&s;ucce&s;sful lover of
Lavinia.&mdash;Tu ne divinam Aeneida tenta, &s;ed longe

not pre&s;ent them&s;elves of the dignity of the foot!</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="297">
BY the foot is denoted the zeal of friend&s;hip, as
well as the maje&s;ty of power. To give con&s;ent by
nodding the <HI>head</HI> may have been agreeable to the
fa&s;hion of Olympus, as it was Jupiter's con&s;tant

as a mark of frigid approbation: and a &s;how of

does not manife&s;t uncommon regard or anxiety.
But <HI>Pedibus</HI> in &s;ententiam ire &s;ignified, among the

a certain philo&s;opher,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Prior's Alma.</NOTE> who a&s;&s;erts that the &s;oul
enters its body at the feet (even as the grand &s;ei|gnior
does his bed): a doctrine which, if not de|mon&s;trably
certain, mu&s;t have been in &s;ome re|pute
among tho&s;e who drank of that deep foun|tain
of philo&s;ophy, the Peripatetick &s;chool; the
principles whereof were, as the name implies, con|nected
with walking, and by con&s;equence with
feet.</P>
<P>THE honourable appellation of <HI>foot</HI> is not con|fined
to animals, but is applied to every thing u&s;e|ful
or great in the works of art and nature. We
do not &s;ay the <HI>leg</HI> of a table, a chair, a column,
<PB N="306" REF="298">
but the <HI>foot;</HI> we &s;peak in like manner of the <HI>foot;</HI>
of a pyramid or mountain, never the <HI>leg.</HI> Italy,
formerly the mi&s;tre&s;s of nations, appears in the
map as a boot; which I own &s;uppo&s;es a leg, but
in which a foot is al&s;o comprehended; and the &s;ole
of that boot faces the &s;outh, a very re&s;pectable quar|ter
of the &s;ky; and the toe points at Sicily, intimat|ting
its authority to kick even the granary of
the world (for &s;o that i&s;land was &s;ometimes cal|led)
without being in the lea&s;t intimidated by
Scylla and Charybdis: the <HI>ingurgitations</HI> of the one,
the <HI>evomitions</HI> of the other, or even the thundering
<HI>eructations</HI> of Etna it&s;elf. We characteri&s;e the con|fidence
of friend&s;hip by &s;aying that people are on
a good <HI>footing:</HI> and though Ce&s;ar had a <HI>hand</HI> in
the inva&s;ion of Britain, it would have required a
power greater than Ce&s;ar's to get <HI>footing</HI> there.</P>
<P>I need not remind the intelligent reader, that
<HI>feet</HI> are the foundation of mea&s;ure, and the apprai|&s;ers
of quantity: a &s;ufficient proof of the tru&s;t re|po&s;ed
in them by the wi&s;dom of our forefathers.
Nay Horace extends their influence to the men|&s;uration
of quality as well as quantity, when he
&s;ays <HI>Metiri</HI> &s;e quemque &s;uo <HI>pede</HI> verum e&s;t. Nor
<PB N="307" REF="299">
can we fail to ob&s;erve, in many names denoting
quality, and in many ab&s;tract terms of &s;cience,
an allu&s;ion to the &s;upport of the feet. Thus, in
Latin <HI>gradus</HI> (&s;tep) degree; <HI>ca&s;us</HI> (falling) ca&s;e;
and in our own tongue <HI>&s;uppo&s;ition, &s;ubject, &s;upplant,
under&s;tanding, inculcate,</HI> and many others. Trage|dy
too, and comedy, derived from the foot one of
their antient de&s;ignations; being di&s;tingui&s;hed
and named by the <HI>&s;ock</HI> and <HI>bu&s;kin</HI> worn on the
feet of the actors. Hunc <HI>&s;occi</HI> cepere pedem gran|de&s;que
<HI>cothurni.</HI></P>
<P>AND this leads me to remark, in more general
terms, that Poetry, the noble&s;t effort of genius, is
formed and divided, as every &s;choolboy knows,
by feet. Even humbler &s;orts of writing claim a
connection with the &s;ame honourable member, de|nominating
them&s;elves <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> or <HI>&s;ermo pede&s;tris.</HI>
Nor mu&s;t I overlook a very notable coincidence
between the Engli&s;h noun <HI>pro&s;e</HI> or pede&s;tris &s;ermo,
and the Greek <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> (pros) which actually &s;ignifies
the &s;ame thing with our prepo&s;ition <HI>to,</HI> who&s;e af|finity
with <HI>toe</HI> I am endeavouring to e&s;tabli&s;h. I
may add, that Horace, who&s;e &s;kill in critici&s;m can
hardly be di&s;puted, &s;eems to be of opinion, that
a per&s;on &s;tanding on one foot will not be &s;o cap|able
<PB N="308" REF="300">
of poetick compo&s;ition as if he were &s;tanding
on both feet:<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Hor. Sat. 1. 4.</NOTE> a certain evidence, if the fact be
acknowledged, that human as well as grammatical
feet are &s;ub&s;ervient to poetry. For of a member
who&s;e ab&s;ence is detrimental, the pre&s;ence mu&s;t
be beneficial.</P>
<P>PULCHRUM e&s;t, &s;ays a Roman poet, digito
mon&s;trari et dicier hic e&s;t.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Per&s;ius, Sat. 1.</NOTE> Now it being <HI>unpo|lite,</HI>
which is the rever&s;e of <HI>pulchrum,</HI> to point with
the finger at individuals in the &s;treet, I am &s;ure
every learned reader will agree with me, that <HI>digi|to</HI>
in this pa&s;&s;age mu&s;t mean, not the finger, but
the <HI>toe,</HI> a &s;en&s;e in which it is u&s;ed by Virgil<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Aeneid, V. 426.</NOTE> and
other authors: &startq;it is a fine thing to be pointed at
with the toe.&endq; Every body mu&s;t have ob&s;erved,
that it is natural for us to turn our toes towards
the per&s;on whom we look at. Dancing ma&s;ters,
indeed, and Frenchmen, turn theirs a&s;ide; which
is called <HI>turning out</HI> their toes, that is, degrading
them, as a prime mini&s;ter is degraded when he is
<HI>turned out;</HI> but that attitude is wholly artificial,
and &s;o inconvenient that the late dauphin of France,
if we may believe new&s;papers, lo&s;t his life by it.
<PB N="309" REF="301">
To which I may add, that the article in Greek,
corre&s;ponding to our Engli&s;h <HI>the,</HI> is <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> that the
word <HI>article</HI> &s;ignifies a <HI>joint;</HI> and that, by &s;ome
Latin writers, <HI>articuli pedis,</HI> the joints of the foot,
are u&s;ed for <HI>the toes.</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE now given abundant evidence of that
re&s;pectful attention which has been paid to the
foot, and e&s;pecially to its toes; by which, as a
plant by its flower, it is both characterized and
adorned. Permit me, however, to add, that the
feet and toes, which have thus in the mo&s;t enlight|tened
nations been the &s;eat of authority, the em|blem
of rectitude, the &s;pring of &s;cience, and the
object of affection and reverence, are al&s;o the di&s;|tingui&s;hing
characteri&s;tick of the human race. For
ingenious anatomi&s;ts, after a mo&s;t accurate di&s;&s;ec|tion
of the Ouran Outan's body&mdash;(anatomi&s;ts
never think of &s;ouls)&mdash;find no criterion &s;o deci&s;ive
as the toes and the feet, whereby his &s;pecies may
be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the human. And although
the godlike Pythagoras, or the divine Plato, who
had a glimp&s;e of the pre-eminence of humanity,
defined man to be <HI>implume bipes,</HI> a featherle&s;s two
footed thing, and though Sallu&s;t and Ovid di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
<PB N="310" REF="302">
him by the <HI>Os &s;ublime;</HI> yet both the&s;e cha|racters
apply to the Outang: who&s;e feet, never|thele&s;s,
are prominent at the heel, and who&s;e great
toes and thumbs very nearly re&s;emble. Accord|ingly,
the &s;agacious Greeks, though content in
common language to denominate the human &s;pe|cies,
from its erect &s;tature, <HI>Anthr&oacute;pos,</HI> (a term, by
the by, of no great pre-eminence, for at Athens,
when the article was prefixed, it belonged pecu|liarly
to the hangman); yet, when they wi&s;hed
to &s;peak with accuracy in mentioning an indivi|dual,
they honoured him with the appellation of
TWO TOES <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">): a word, which has long
been ob&s;olete; but who&s;e former exi&s;tence and
&s;ignification appear &s;ufficiently from its neuter
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</P>
<P>IT may therefore be rea&s;onably inferred, that
our prudent ance&s;tors, who, in forming their pre|po&s;itions,
often employed the name of a pa&s;&s;age, a
&s;eat, or a door, would not overlook a member &s;o
important and honourable as the <HI>toe.</HI> This infer|ence
would &s;eem to be ju&s;tly drawn, according to
the mode of argument u&s;ually employed in &s;uch
ca&s;es; wherein demon&s;tration is &s;eldom &s;ought,
becau&s;e it is not often to be found: and this in|ference
<PB N="311" REF="303">
will, I tru&s;t, force conviction in tho&s;e who
reflect, that the prepo&s;ition <HI>to</HI> really exi&s;ts, and is
found to be from experience what from rea&s;oning
we &s;hould have expected. But as in the brea&s;t of
the candid reader I wi&s;h not to leave even the &s;ha|dow
of a doubt, I will in few words explain, why
the prepo&s;ition <HI>to,</HI> from its connection with the
noun <HI>toe,</HI> came to acquire that &s;ignification, and
that only, which it now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>IT cannot be doubted, that, in de&s;cribing the
motions of the body, regard will naturally be
had to the parts of the body moved, and to their
relative po&s;itions. Thus we &s;peak of turning to
the <HI>right hand</HI> and to the <HI>left:</HI> and in like manner
&s;ome antient nations, among whom perhaps the
refinements of <HI>right</HI> and <HI>left</HI> were not thoroughly
under&s;tood, &s;poke of turning to the <HI>&s;hield</HI> and to
the <HI>&s;pear;</HI> phra&s;es, which a learned grammarian
of our own, Mr John Milton, has adopted.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t, IV. 785.</NOTE>
We &s;ay in Latin, adver&s;is opponere <HI>pectora</HI> rebus;
dare <HI>terga</HI> ho&s;ti; flectere in <HI>latus;</HI> in <HI>genua</HI> pro|cumbere:
and, in the modern tongues, to talk <HI>tete
<PB N="312" REF="304">
a tete,</HI> to <HI>confront,</HI> to meet <HI>face to face,</HI> to drink <HI>hand
to fi&s;t,</HI> to walk <HI>&s;ide by &s;ide,</HI> to &s;it <HI>cheek by jowl,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>NOW the locomotive powers of man exert them|&s;elves
by his legs and feet; and by man, therefore,
motion will mo&s;t naturally be expre&s;&s;ed with &s;ome
allu&s;ion to the&s;e members. Accordingly, <HI>pedem</HI> vel
<HI>gradum</HI> promovere, inferre, referre, flectere, &s;i&s;tere,
premere, and many like expre&s;&s;ions, are frequent|ly
met with. We read too of the &s;wift-<HI>footed</HI> A|chilles;
of pilgrims reque&s;ting the &s;tranger to di|rect
their <HI>feet</HI> in peace; and of fairies, who &startq;<HI>foot
it</HI> featly, ranged in ringlets gay.&endq; Now to any
common ob&s;erver it mu&s;t be obvious, that <HI>crus</HI> in|ferre,
promovere, &s;i&s;tere, would be uncouth Latin;
as the &s;wift-<HI>legged</HI> Achilles would &s;eem vulgar in
Engli&s;h; or a pilgrim reque&s;ting that his <HI>legs</HI> might
be directed in peace; or fairies, who &s;hould be
&s;aid to <HI>leg it</HI> featly. It is true, that in &s;ome a&s;|&s;emblies
famous for eloquence, the members are
often &s;aid to be on their <HI>legs,</HI> but never on their
<HI>feet:</HI> but that phra&s;e I take to be figurative; though
I own, that to expre&s;s the act of &s;peaking by an
allu&s;ion to the legs is not le&s;s incongruous, than
to &s;ignify that of walking, dancing, or hopping,
<PB N="313" REF="305">
by an allu&s;ion to the tongue. But to return from
this digre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems to follow, from what has been &s;aid,
that motions of the body are commonly and na|turally
characteri&s;ed by motions of the feet. Now
motions of the feet are in like manner characteriz|ed
by the toes and the heel. For, to advance the
foot, to turn away the foot, pedem inferre, amo|vere,
are motions merely relative, and connected
with the po&s;ition of &s;ome external object: when
the foot is advanced towards one quarter, it is re|moved
from the quarter oppo&s;ite. To di&s;tingui&s;h
motion accurately and ab&s;olutely, we mu&s;t there|fore
ob&s;erve the po&s;ition of the foot it&s;elf; as that
is indicated by the direction of its two extremities,
the heel and toes.</P>
<P>IF all this be granted, and granted all this mu&s;t
be; if in &s;peaking of the flight of an enemy we
&s;cruple not to affirm that he &s;howed a clean pair
of <HI>heels;</HI> if a &s;idelong motion is &s;o denominated,
becau&s;e it is a motion towards the <HI>&s;ide;</HI> if a man
is &s;aid to move backwards, becau&s;e he moves in
the direction of the <HI>back;</HI> &s;urely, it mu&s;t be ra|tional
and analogical to infer, that he is &s;aid to ad|vance
<PB N="314" REF="306">
<HI>towards,</HI> or (as it &s;hould be written) <HI>toewards,</HI>
an object, who advances in the direction of the
<HI>toe.</HI> And, as our prepo&s;itions <HI>to</HI> and <HI>towards</HI> are
undoubtedly of the &s;ame original, can it be doubt|ed,
that from the &s;ub&s;tantive <HI>toe</HI> the prepo&s;ition <HI>to</HI>
is derived? I will not in&s;ult the good &s;en&s;e and
erudition of my reader, by &s;uppo&s;ing that this can
&s;eem any longer uncertain; nor need I give addi|tional
evidence of a point which is already e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
inconte&s;tably.</P>
<P>PERMIT me however to remark, before I leave
this delightful &s;ubject, that the Latin <HI>ver&s;us,</HI> &s;igni|fying
<HI>towards,</HI> is the &s;ame word with <HI>ver&s;us</HI> the
noun, which denotes an a&s;&s;emblage of poetical
feet. This proves, that the motion &s;ignified by
<HI>ver&s;us</HI> is connected with <HI>feet:</HI> nor is this at all in|con&s;i&s;tent
with what I formerly remarked concern|ing
the connection of feet, or &s;ermo pede&s;tris, or
pro&s;e, with the Greek <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> (pros) who&s;e meaning
corre&s;ponds &s;o nearly with that of the Latin <HI>ver|&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>IF the&s;e reflections, by opening new &s;ources of
grammatical di&s;covery, &s;hall reclaim the &s;tudious
from experiment to &s;cience, my midnight oil has
<PB N="315" REF="307">
not burned in vain, and my gray hairs will go
down to the grave with honour. Horace affec|tionately
compares the words of a language to ci|tizens
in a &s;tate; likening to the cen&s;or who di&s;|graces
a citizen the critick who degrades a word.
How &s;hall we an&s;wer to our con&s;cience and coun|try,
if we &s;uffer not one word only, but the whole
grammatical commonwealth, to incur the danger
of degradation, while we are e&s;tabli&s;hing (ri&s;um
teneatis amici?) the &s;pecifick differences of weeds
and vermin, or anatomi&s;ing the vi&s;cera of a cater|pillar!
We have received from our forefathers a
government &s;tored with the trea&s;ures of legi&s;lative
wi&s;dom, and a language rich in the wealth of ge|nuine
&s;cience: both it behoves us to watch with
vigilance, and to protect with vigour. Man, who
is a being active and protect with vigour. Man, who
is a being active and intelligent, requires freedom,
that he may act, and opportunity, that he may
learn: and they who de&s;pi&s;e etymology the repo|&s;itory

guardian of liberty, de&s;erve alike the puni&s;hment

In regard to your pa&s;t conduct and attainments
I need only ob&s;erve, that, as far as I am connec|ted
with them, it would be highly unrea&s;onable
to be di&s;&s;atisfied. You have not all, indeed, equal
learning; but neither can you all have had equal
opportunity to learn: and there is not one among
you, who, if he &s;hall continue the pro&s;ecution of
literature, may not with moderate application
make a good appearance. If &s;ome of you have le&s;s
regularly than others attended the bu&s;ine&s;s of the

&s;ome levity not de&s;irable in a &s;ociety of
philo&s;ophers; my duty mu&s;t have required me
not to let it pa&s;s unnoticed. Such momentary
inadvertence, however, I willingly con&s;ider as the ob|ject
rather of admonition than of reproof. For in the
&s;teadie&s;t minds there is a tendency to ea&s;e and relaxa|tion;
a &s;ort of ela&s;tick force which no weight of &s;tu|dy

obtruding upon the mo&s;t guarded &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s a lu|dicrous

&s;leepy delirium, early dotage, and a mi&s;erable
death. Now, that they enjoy &s;ome momentary
corporeal gratifications more exqui&s;ite than tho&s;e
of men in health, &s;eems very probable: yet who
is &s;o frantick as to believe their condition &s;o good
as that of men in health, even with regard to mere
bodily plea&s;ure?</P>
<P>&startq;BUT does not the per&s;on (one might a&s;k)
who has it in his power to derive habitual plea|&s;ure
from an habitual u&s;e of opium, and yet
neglects to u&s;e it, omit an opportunity of gra|tification,
and con&s;equently make his &s;um of
happine&s;s &s;maller than it might have been?&endq; It
might be an&s;wered, if &s;uch a que&s;tion were thought
worthy of an an&s;wer, that the habitual u&s;e of this
drug, in exchange for that &s;hort and pre&s;ent en|joyment
which it &s;upplies, prevents greater and
future enjoyments; and therefore dimini&s;hes, in|&s;tead
of increa&s;ing, the general &s;um of happine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="314">
NEVER, probably, was the que&s;tion propo&s;ed:
yet &s;imilar que&s;tions, of greater ab&s;urdity and
more dangerous con&s;equence, are, tacitly at lea&s;t,
and in practice if not in words, a&s;&s;ented to every
day. &startq;Does not the per&s;on, who has it in his
power to derive enjoyment from the pre&s;ent
gratification of covetou&s;ne&s;s, revenge, or &s;en&s;u|ality,
and neglects to do &s;o, omit an opportuni|ty
of plea&s;ure, and con&s;equently make the &s;um
of his happine&s;s &s;maller than it might have
been?&endq; To this que&s;tion few men perhaps would
give an affirmative an&s;wer; yet men &s;urely act as
if they thought it de&s;erved one, who follow cour|&s;es,
which, if its doctrine is ill-founded, are hurt|ful,
not to the happine&s;s of others only, but to
their own. The gratifications propo&s;ed in this
que&s;tion, like tho&s;e in the former, dimini&s;h, in|&s;tead
of increa&s;ing, the general &s;um of happine&s;s,
by excluding other enjoyments more excellent,
and of longer continuance.</P>
<P>TO us, in &s;hort, this is the language of both
rea&s;on and revelation:&mdash;Ye de&s;ire happine&s;s, and
ye do well, &s;ince for happine&s;s ye were intended:
be as happy as ye can. Only, for your own &s;akes,
have prudence enough to believe, that your hap|pine&s;s
<PB N="323" REF="315">
will not be con&s;ulted in &s;acrificing a great|er
to a le&s;s enjoyment.</P>
<P>COMPLIANCE with this rea&s;onable admonition
will &s;ometimes indeed require us to ab&s;tain from
things apparently de&s;irable: but &s;uch ab&s;tinence is
unavoidable in this world of probation, where in|con&s;i&s;tent
plea&s;ures are propo&s;ed to our choice, for
an exerci&s;e to the virtuous, and opportunity to the
wicked. The que&s;tion is, not whether we &s;hall
give up <HI>any</HI> of the gratifications we are capable
of; for &s;ome of them mu&s;t be given up whatever
cour&s;e we follow, &s;ince it is impo&s;&s;ible to enjoy at
the &s;ame time things incon&s;i&s;tent with each other:
but the que&s;tion is, <HI>which</HI> of them &s;hall be given
up; the virtuous, or the vitious, the greater good,
or the le&s;s. Shall we lament the hard&s;hip of this
&s;acrifice? As well might a hungry man, who had
either poi&s;oned or whole&s;ome eatables in his choice,
complain, becau&s;e he could not have the whole|&s;ome,
without ab&s;taining from the poi&s;oned.</P>
<P>BUT a life of virtue, it may be &s;aid, demands
painful and perpetual ab&s;tinence.&mdash;Now if a man's
experience of the matter he decides on, may be
<PB N="324" REF="316">
allowed to give weight to his deci&s;ion, this cavil
can have little authority; having been propo&s;ed,
never by a virtuous man, but by tho&s;e only who,
in&s;tead of having experienced a life of virtue, are
devi&s;ing rea&s;ons to excu&s;e them&s;elves from ever
experiencing it. The objection, however, may be
confuted on &s;urer ground than the character of
the objectors. For they, according to the com|mon
practice of &s;ophi&s;tical rea&s;oners, who conceal
one part of a &s;ubject in order to give an appear|ance
of deformity or di&s;proportion to the re&s;t, do
not con&s;ider, that, not virtuous action only, but
every &s;ort of human action, requires perpetual ab|&s;tinence.
Even his daily bread man mu&s;t procure
in the &s;weat of his brow; ab&s;taining often from
re&s;t, when weary; from drink, when thir&s;ty;
when warm, from refre&s;hment; from merriment,
when chearful; and, when &s;erious, from contem|plation.
If the more complex duties, and more
oppre&s;&s;ive &s;orrows, of human life were to be con|&s;idered,
we &s;hould find our&s;elves obliged, every
day and every hour, to &s;elf-re&s;traint and voluntary
hard&s;hip. In this re&s;pect, the plea&s;ures of vice re|quire
as much more hard&s;hip as they are le&s;s de|&s;erving
of it. For, not to mention the various
<PB N="325" REF="317">
bodily di&s;orders, and con&s;equent &s;erverities of me|dical
regimen, which from intemperance men of|ten
&s;uffer, and always have rea&s;on to apprehend;
and not to in&s;i&s;t on that dreadful expectation of
futurity, from which no vitious man, however he
may di&s;&s;emble, is entirely free, which haunts him
in &s;olitude, intrudes on him in &s;ociety, &s;tings his
&s;oul in the mid&s;t of plea&s;ure, hara&s;&s;es him in &s;ick|ne&s;s,
and makes death, which Chri&s;tians approach
as the gate of heaven, appear to him the jaws of
darkne&s;s and horror;&mdash;not to mention the&s;e, vice
&s;uffers, with keenne&s;s infinitely &s;uperiour to what
virtue does or can do, the pain of ab&s;tinence in
regard to tho&s;e very plea&s;ures which alone it pro|po&s;es
to enjoy. The de&s;ires of the vitious man,
exa&s;perated by gratification and untamed by prin|ciple;
while yet the terrors of human law, and
&s;ome natural &s;en&s;e of decorum, permit him but at
times to comply with them; being far more vio|lent
than tho&s;e of the virtuous, are with much
greater difficulty &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, while it is al&s;o nece&s;|&s;ary
to &s;uppre&s;s them much more frequently; and
each &s;ucce&s;&s;ive gratification, in&s;tead of allaying
&s;en&s;uality, &s;erves only to confirm the habit of it.
Virtue, too, appears with &s;uch fearle&s;s dignity, as
<PB N="326" REF="318">
to command not only the re&s;pect of her enemies,
but even their imitation. Men of pro&s;ligate cha|racter
in private life mu&s;t wear in publick &s;ome
externals of decorum; and, if they could be im|partial,
would feel with how much greater ea&s;e
they might avoid their vices than di&s;&s;emble them,
and acquire the reality of virtue than mimick the
appearance. And if they could experience the
hard&s;hips of virtue as well as of vice, they would
be &s;en&s;ible, that to execute one &s;cheme of vitious
plea&s;ure may have co&s;t them, not greater unea&s;i|ne&s;s
of mind only, but even greater anxiety and
re&s;traint with regard to their darling pur&s;uits, than
might have been nece&s;&s;ary in a whole life of rec|titude.</P>
<P>AND what, after all, are tho&s;e tremendous hard|&s;hips
that di&s;courage the commencement or the
continuation of a virtuous life? Are they bodily
pain or ftigue? No: they are, a body &s;trength|ened
by temperance, and unruffled by pa&s;&s;ion. Are
they vexation for the pa&s;t, or dread of the future?
No: they are the remembrance of having acted
well, and the anticipation of heaven. Are they
pre&s;ent &s;orrow, ob&s;curity, or want? No: they are
a mind po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of trea&s;ures incorruptible; a
<PB N="327" REF="319">
mind, which, rejoicing in the good providence of
its Creators, can contemn greatne&s;s, and triumph
in affliction. In truth, virtue is not now a thing
which either creates the misfortunes and hard&s;hips
of life or annihilates them: it is the way of living
with as little hard&s;hip as po&s;&s;ible, and as little mi&s;fortune.
Virtue, in the&s;e lands of religious liber|ty,
is no &s;y&s;tem of cumber&s;ome ceremonies, or
au&s;tere &s;elf-denial: it is but obedience to the will
of God; in other words, it is but the doing of that
which will bring to our&s;elves and our fellow men
the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible proportion of happine&s;s. Per|haps
it is a true a&s;&s;ertion, though it may appear a
whim&s;ical one, that with le&s;s fatigue or re&s;traint,
either of mind or body, than is requi&s;ite before
we can learn to read Virgil, we might &s;ecure our|&s;elves
honour in this world and eternal felicity in
the next.</P>
<P>MOST gratefully ought we to acknowledge the
goodne&s;s of God, in offeing us &s;lavation on terms
&s;o ea&s;y, that, in order to attain our greate&s;t happ|ne&s;s
in heaven, we have only to prefer and pur&s;ue
what is in reality our greate&s;t happine&s;s on earth.
Yet, were Chri&s;tian virtue attended in this life by
hard&s;hips infinitely exceeding tho&s;e that now at|tend
<PB N="328" REF="320">
it, nay, were it one uncea&s;ing hard&s;hip of both
mind and body, no rational being who &s;ought his
own intere&s;t could he&s;itate a moment in determin|ing
to practi&s;e it, con&s;idering the authority by
which it is enjoined, and the everla&s;ting import|ance
of the &s;anctions awaiting it hereafter. For
the New Te&s;tament not only contains a &s;y&s;tem of
moral doctrine &s;o pure and perfect, as would de|&s;erve
the acquie&s;cence of every true philo&s;opher,
even if it had been propo&s;ed by no divine autho|rity,
or connected with no eternal retribution;
but is, moreover, atte&s;ted by proofs &s;o &s;trong and
&s;o various, that the conver&s;ion of tho&s;e who reject
it could hardly be hoped for, though a me&s;&s;enger
from the dead were commi&s;&s;ioned on purpo&s;e.
This may &s;eem paradoxical: yet any candid man,
who is acquainted with the hi&s;tory of the Chri&s;tian
church, may ea&s;ily convince him&s;elf, that it is not
the want of rea&s;onable evidence in our religion
which makes the infidel di&s;like it, but the want of
licentious doctrine; a want which no me&s;&s;enger
from the dead could be expected to &s;upply. Look
on the conduct and morality of unbelievers.
Where is the man among them, who&s;e virtue has
&s;ugge&s;ted an improvement to that &s;y&s;tem which
<PB N="329" REF="321">
he renounces as imperfect? Alas! he renounces
it, in order, not to improve his virtue, but to hide
from him&s;elf his &s;ins of which it would perpetu|ally
remind him. Where is the man among them,
who retains in other inquiries that &s;crupulo&s;ity of
logick, which he tortures to perplex the evidence
of the go&s;pel? Alas! the bla&s;phemy of Voltaire
is tried by gentler &s;crutiny than the doctrine of
Je&s;us: and at la&s;t we learn, that, in oppo&s;ition to
the cruelty of &s;ome intere&s;ted Jews, the ob&s;tinacy
of a few antient believers in magick, the palpable
mi&s;takes and mi&s;repre&s;entations of in&s;idious or ig|norant
men, the apo&s;tacy of a profligate emperor,
the &s;neer of a petulant Frenchman&mdash;the opinions
of the learned avail nothing, nor the practice of
the virtuous, nor the certainty of the inference of
the cau&s;e from the effect, nor the faith of nations,
nor the accompli&s;hment of prophecy, nor the de|mon&s;tration
of miracles, nor the blood and te&s;ti|mony
of ten thou&s;and martyrs.</P>
<P>THIS &s;ubject needs no further pro&s;ecution. If
I were arguing with men prejudiced again&s;t vir|tue
and Chri&s;tianity, there would now be no time
for confutation; there is now no occa&s;ion for it,
<PB N="330" REF="322">
while I addre&s;s my&s;elf to tho&s;e who, having &s;een
the evidence of the go&s;pel to be &s;tronger than that
of any other antient narrative; having &s;een, how
much, even in this life, the joys overballance the
difficulties of virtue; and having con&s;idered the
value of that everla&s;ting inheritance which God
has prepared for them who love him; will not
ha&s;tily give up the conviction of their under&s;tand|ing,
the approbation of their con&s;cience, the e&s;teem
of mankind, the favour of Omnipotence, and the
&s;ociety of angels and ju&s;t men made perfect, for
the honour of attending an athei&s;tical &s;ophi&s;ter in|to
either that puni&s;hment, which he has too much
rea&s;on to apprehend, or that annihilation, which
is the la&s;t and deare&s;t object of his wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>GOD, who&s;e adorable providence &s;upplies each
individual man, nay and even the mo&s;t diminu|tive
in&s;ect, with &s;ome advantages, to make up for
the di&s;advantages of its condition, afforded to tho&s;e
primitive Chri&s;tians, who&s;e faith was to be tried
in per&s;ecution and torment, the clear and infalli|ble
evidence of miracles, wrought often before
their eyes, and often at their command. To us
who, by his goodne&s;s, live in days of peace and
<PB N="331" REF="323">
liberty, he offers a &s;y&s;tem of evidence, not, if we
will hone&s;tly con&s;ider it, le&s;s convincing; but
more exten&s;ive, and con&s;equently more liable to
be overlooked by the negligent, or mi&s;repre&s;ented
by the malicious. The rays of demon&s;tration,
which enlightened tho&s;e fir&s;t pro&s;elytes to Chri&s;|tianity,
are, at this interval of time, di&s;per&s;ed,
though not dimini&s;hed: what &s;hone clear upon
them, from miracles performed in their pre&s;ence,
we have now to trace and collect through all the
range of hi&s;tory. And although, of a light &s;o
durable and &s;o widely diffu&s;ed, and in its progre&s;s,
through many ages and nations, &s;o often height|ened
by contra&s;t and multiplied by reflection, the
reality be not now le&s;s di&s;cernible to candid ob|&s;ervers,
than it was when the beams were more
clo&s;ely concentered; the &s;plendour is le&s;s alluring,
and the quantity will &s;eem le&s;s con&s;iderable, to
tho&s;e, who are too indolent to examine all the ex|pan&s;e
which it enlightens, and more willing to be
dazzled by inevitable conviction, than to bear the
fatigue of patient enquiry.</P>
<P>THIS pre&s;ent &s;tate of the evidence of our reli|gion
infidels would fain repre&s;ent as un&s;uitable to
the conduct of Divine providence; converting in|to
<PB N="332" REF="324">
an argument again&s;t Chri&s;tianity facts that fur|ni&s;h
no &s;mall evidence in its favour. Tho&s;e infi|dels,
however, will find it rather difficult to prove,
that God would mo&s;t effectually have &s;upported
the dignity, by abandoning the ju&s;tice, of his ad|mini&s;tration;
by giving tho&s;e primitive Chri&s;tians
who had &s;o much greater temptation than we have
to do wrong, no more &s;triking encouragement to
do right; or by appointing that inattentive and
worldly-minded men, in the&s;e times of religious
tranquillity, &s;hould have much encouragement
and an eternal recompence, for believing what it
was impo&s;&s;ible for them to doubt. Yet has he,
who makes all things work together for good to
&s;uch as diligently &s;eek him, perpetuated to us in
&s;ome mea&s;ure, by means of the very &s;uffering tho&s;e
fir&s;t Chri&s;tians endured, that evidence of miracles
which convinced and &s;upported them: and al|though,
from the circum&s;tances of the time, we
cannot &s;hare with them in the ble&s;&s;ing be&s;towed
on &s;uch as for&s;ake hou&s;e or friends or life for
the go&s;pel; we may partake, in a ble&s;&s;ing which
they enjoy not,&mdash;the ble&s;&s;ing &startq;of tho&s;e who have
not &s;een, and yet have believed.&endq;</P>
<P>AFTER the&s;e remarks on the practice of virtue
as indi&s;pen&s;able to happine&s;s, allow me to mention
<PB N="333" REF="325">
a &s;tudy indi&s;pen&s;able to the knowledge of virtue;
I mean the &s;tudy of the Scripture. This I &s;eek
not to enforce by argument: for on tho&s;e it needs
not be enforced who propo&s;e to dedicate their time
to theology; and men of other profe&s;&s;ions are be|yond
the reach of argument, if they think it un|rea&s;onable
that, after a day &s;pent in advancing
their temporal intere&s;t, and &s;tudying the inclina|tions
of man, &s;ome minutes &s;hould be given to the
law of God, and the intere&s;ts of eternity.</P>
<P>&startq;BUT is not the &s;tudy of Scripture a dry occu|pation,
requiring much toil of critici&s;m, and fre|quent
&s;earch of commentators?&endq; If dryne&s;s in
compo&s;ition be the oppo&s;ite of what is brief, ele|gant,
intere&s;ting, and momentous, the &s;tudy of
Scripture will be acknowledged, by all who are in
any degree conver&s;ant in it, to de&s;erve as little to
be called dry, as any &s;cience whatever. With re|gard
to the authority of critici&s;ms and comments;
as far as they &s;erve to make us better acquainted
with the go&s;pel, either by remarks on the language
in which it is written, or by gathering into one
view all the pa&s;&s;ages connected with each particu|lar
doctrine, &s;o far they are u&s;eful in directing, or
<PB N="334" REF="326">
abridging at lea&s;t, the labours of the &s;tudent.
But further than this it may be dangerous to tru&s;t
them; and even without tru&s;ting them thus far
we may learn with certainty all the doctrines e&s;|&s;ential
to &s;alvation. So little is labour of critici&s;m,
or frequent &s;earch of commentators, nece&s;&s;ary for
the &s;erious Chri&s;tian, or even expedient. Let the
interpreter a&s;&s;i&s;t, but never command our con|&s;ciences.
It would be hard indeed if Prote&s;tants,
who have broken the fetters of a whole infallible
church, &s;hould &s;ubmit in voluntary bondage to
any one infallible churchman.</P>
<P>THE &s;tudy of the Scriptures is u&s;eful, not merely
as the &s;afe&s;t means of learning their doctrine; it
will furni&s;h al&s;o no incon&s;iderable evidence of their
truth. I do not allude &s;olely to the purity of their
precepts as &s;upplying a proof of their divine ori|ginal;
or to the &s;implicity and candour of the nar|rative
&s;o remote from the caution and &s;ubterfuges
of impo&s;ture. But I mean that, &s;uppo&s;ing a &s;y&s;|tem
of doctrine to be contrived by impo&s;tors ever
&s;o &s;kilful; (and that the fir&s;t chri&s;tians were un|&s;killed
in impo&s;ition no infidel would require us
to grant); &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem not only <HI>would probably</HI>
contain &s;ome things <HI>di&s;&s;imilar</HI> to what we find in
<PB N="335" REF="327">
the New Te&s;tament, but <HI>mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily</HI> contain
many things altogether incompatible with it. For
impo&s;tors, not having (as every infidel &s;uppo&s;es
that the fir&s;t chri&s;tians had not) any view of ad|vantage
from a future life, mu&s;t have had &s;ome
hope from the pre&s;ent: all which hope, in the fir&s;t
preachers of the Go&s;pel, their writings, in&s;tead of
tending by any means to countenance, tend di|rectly
to counteract and overthrow; as every can|did
reader of the New Te&s;tament will &s;ee with
evidence incontrovertible. Did St. Paul, for ex|ample,
wi&s;h to acquire, among tho&s;e of Corinth
whom he converted, reverence and authority &s;uit|ed
to advance his own temporal power and plea|&s;ure?
That per&s;on will hardly think he did, who
reads, in the epi&s;tles to the Corinthians, the fol|lowing
and many &s;imilar pa&s;&s;ages: &startq;While one
among you &s;aith, I am of Paul, or I of Apollos,
are ye not carnal? I have planted, Apollos wa|tered,
but God gave the increa&s;e. So then nei|ther
is he that planteth any thing, nor he that
watereth, but God.&endq; I. 3. &startq;The Lord hath or|dained,
that they which preach the go&s;pel &s;hould
live by the go&s;pel. But I have u&s;ed none of tho&s;e
things. Neither have I written the&s;e things, that it
<PB N="336" REF="328">
&s;hould be &s;o done unto me. For, though I preach
the go&s;pel, I have nothing to glory of; yea, woe is
unto me, if I preach not the go&s;pel. But I keep
under my body, and bring it into &s;ubjection,
le&s;t that by any means, when I have preached
to others, I my&s;elf &s;hould be a ca&s;t-away.&endq; I. 9.
&startq;I am the lea&s;t of all the apo&s;tles, that am not
worthy to be called an apo&s;tle, becau&s;e I per&s;ecu|ted
the church of God.&endq; I. 15. &startq;We preach not
our&s;elves but Je&s;us the Lord, and our&s;elves your
&s;ervants for Je&s;us's &s;ake: for God, who com|manded
the light to &s;hine out of darkne&s;s, hath
&s;hined in our hearts.&endq; II. 4. Even when com|pelled,
by the mi&s;repre&s;entations of enemies, he
reminds the Corinthian church of the miracles he
had performed, and claims their re&s;pect to the dig|nity
of the commi&s;&s;ion he bore, he immediately
&s;ubjoins, &startq;I &s;peak as a fool; I am become a fool
in glorying. If I mu&s;t needs glory, I will ra|ther
glory in my infirmities, that the power of
Chri&s;t may re&s;t upon me.&endq; II. 11. 12. The&s;e
pa&s;&s;ages are mentioned, merely as a &s;pecimen of
that evidence for the truth of Scripture, which
may be found in the bare language of Scripture
it&s;elf. I am far from wi&s;hing to repre&s;ent them
<PB N="337" REF="329">
as the mo&s;t &s;triking that might be cho&s;en, or as
containing any con&s;iderable part of the evidence
alluded to; which indeed cannot with ju&s;tice be
either attacked or &s;upported from the quotation
of a few ap&s;erate &s;entences; and who&s;e full force
is only to be e&s;timated from an attentive peru&s;al
of the whole New Te&s;tament.</P>
<P>THUS far, as it is impo&s;&s;ible even to conjecture,
in what circum&s;tances we may hereafter be placed,
and, con&s;equently, what particulars of conduct,
under tho&s;e circum&s;tances, may mo&s;t effectually
promote our intere&s;t, I have mentioned &s;ome few
of the many motives inclining us to that, which
in all po&s;&s;ible circum&s;tances will direct and &s;up|port
us&mdash;VIRTUE. Of virtue the rewards are in|valuable
and eternal; the hard&s;hips have been
dreaded by tho&s;e who had never experienced them,
but by no virtuous man were ever complained of.
From heaven and futurity Virtue has much to
hope, and can fear nothing. From our fellow men,
even from the mo&s;t profligate, it will gain us re|&s;pect
and confidence. And as to the re&s;traints it
impo&s;es in regard to &s;elf-government, their ad|vantage,
when compared with tho&s;e unavoidable
<PB N="338" REF="330">
in the pur&s;uits of the wicked, is too manife&s;t to be
di&s;puted by any, except by men who wi&s;h, not to
know how they may do right; but to contrive
excu&s;es for what they will do wrong.</P>
<P>THOUGH our religion fails not to remind us,
that we have a &s;oul to &s;ave, as well as a body to
provide for; in warning us to regard the intere&s;ts
of our future &s;tate, it is far from encouraging us
to neglect tho&s;e of the pre&s;ent, On the contrary,
no other &s;y&s;tem has repre&s;ented the pre&s;ent life as
a &s;tate of &s;uch real and &s;erious importance. No
other has pronounced more explicitly, that unle&s;s
a man will work, neither &s;hould he eat. And,
though it declares, without flattery or re&s;erve, the
danger of tho&s;e temptations that attend the rich
and the powerful; no other &s;y&s;tem has pointed
out more rational means of enjoying wealth, or
nobler objects even of worldly ambition. True
indeed, &s;ince every &s;tate in which the Chri&s;tian
can live has its advantages, and is al&s;o permitted
by the providence of God, contentment in every
&s;tate is recommended by religion, as well as by
prudence. Let our condition be ever &s;o bad, it
has &s;till the le&s;s need of di&s;content to make it
<PB N="339" REF="331">
wor&s;e. But we mu&s;t not imagine, that content|ment
ought to hinder us from endeavouring to
make it better. If we di&s;dain to profit by one fair
opportunity of benefiting our&s;elves or others, &s;uch
conduct is not religion, but &s;uper&s;tition or indo|lence.
Heaven is to be won, not by whining
theology, but by practi&s;ing virtue: nor &s;hall we,
by &s;ecre&s;y and &s;loth but by active oppo&s;ition, e&s;|cape
that adver&s;ary, who mu&s;t be re&s;i&s;ted before
he will flee from us, and who has vi&s;ited not more
frequently the lazy ingnorance of &s;avage life, than
the devout lethargy of the cloi&s;ter. As the body
without the &s;oul is dead, faith without works is
dead al&s;o. For the amendment of pa&s;t errors, and
the regulation of future practice, our times of &s;e|rious
meditation ought to be frequent; but let us
not think it nece&s;&s;ary to make them perpetual or
laborious. While with hone&s;t indu&s;try we con|duct
our bu&s;ine&s;s in life, grateful to God and hum|bly
tru&s;ting in his mercy, we wor&s;hip with the
mo&s;t acceptable &s;ervice that Gracious Being, who
gave us knowledge but as an in&s;trument of action;
who is well plea&s;ed to &s;ee his creatures promote
the comfort of that nature he has given them, by
a rational u&s;e of tho&s;e benefits he has provided;
<PB N="340" REF="332">
and who has promi&s;ed the joys of his eternal king|dom,
not to men of o&s;tentatious &s;ancitity, but to
&s;uch as walk in truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s, fearing
God, and loving one another.</P>
