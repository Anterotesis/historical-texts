<LG>
<L>SWEET Spring! while others hail thy op'ning
flowers,</L>
<L>The fir&s;t young hope of Summer's blu&s;hing hours;</L>
<L>Me they remind, that when her ardent ray</L>

<L><PB N="2" REF="4">
And twice &s;hall Spring, di&s;pelling Winter's gloom,</L>
<L>Shed o'er thy lovely vales her vernal bloom;</L>
<L>Twice &s;hall thy village-maids, with chaplets gay,</L>
<L>And &s;imple carols, hail returning May;</L>
<L>And twice &s;hall Autumn, o'er thy cultur'd plain,</L>
<L>Pour the rich trea&s;ures of his yellow grain;</L>
<L>Twice &s;hall thy happy pea&s;ants bear along</L>
<L>The lavi&s;h &s;tore, and wake the harve&s;t-&s;ong;</L>
<L>Ere from the bounded deep my &s;earching eye,</L>
<L>Ah! land belov'd, &s;hall thy white cliffs de&s;cry.&mdash;</L>
<L>Where the &s;low Loire, on borders ever gay,</L>
<L>Delights to linger, in his &s;unny way,</L>
<L>Oft, while I &s;eem to count, with mu&s;ing glance,</L>
<L>The murm'ring waves that near his brink advance,</L>
<L>My wand'ring thoughts &s;hall &s;eek the gra&s;&s;y &s;ide,</L>
<L>Parental Thames! where rolls thy ample tide;</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="5">
Where, on thy willow'd bank, methinks, appears</L>
<L>Engrav'd the record of my pa&s;&s;ing years;</L>
<L>Ah! not like thine, their cour&s;e is gently led,</L>
<L>By zephyrs fann'd, thro' paths with verdure &s;pread;</L>
<L>They flow, as urg'd by &s;torms the mountain rill</L>
<L>Falls o'er the fragments of the rocky hill.</L>

<L>My native &s;cenes! can aught in time, or &s;pace,</L>

<L>By all that ere my anxious hopes employ'd,</L>
<L>By all my &s;oul has &s;uffer'd, or enjoy'd!</L>
<L>Still blended with tho&s;e well-known &s;cenes, ari&s;e</L>
<L>The varying images the pa&s;t &s;upplies;</L>

The harmle&s;s mirth, the &s;adne&s;s robb'd of power</L>

<L>That hope which &s;eem'd with bright unfolding rays</L>

<L>That hope which, early wrapp'd in la&s;ting gloom,</L>
<L>Sunk in the cold inexorable tomb!&mdash;</L>
<L>And Friend&s;hip, ever powerful to controul</L>
<L>The keen emotions of the wounded &s;oul,</L>
<L>To lift the &s;uff'ring &s;pirit from de&s;pair,</L>
<L>And bid it feel that life de&s;erves a care.</L>
<L>Still each impre&s;&s;ion that my heart retains</L>

The Mu&s;e, who early taught my willing heart</L>

Tears the &s;harp iron from his loaded brea&s;t,</L>
