For as he was always remarkably de|voted to the Cau&s;e of Liberty and Ju&s;tice, (for the Advancement of which the following Piece was written) he thought it would be a kind of Injury, not to con&s;e|crate it to the mo&s;t illu&s;trious Patron of Ju&s;tice, Heroick Vir|tue,

and the Rights of Man|kind. Your Royal Highne&s;s's great Conde&s;cen&s;ion in permit|ting me to execute the Will of my departed Friend, and in pa|tronizing his Orphan Play, is a Circum&s;tance that is very glori|ous to him, and gives a Sancti|on to his Fame.</P>
<P>All true <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> in general, as well as the Friends of Mr. <HI>Lillo</HI> in particular, have great Rea&s;on to congratulate one another on the Protection which your Royal Highne&s;s was graciou&s;ly pleas'd to afford this Piece during the Per|formance of it.

<P>Your Elegancy of Ta&s;te, and Illu&s;trious Virtues render you the mo&s;t generous Protector and the noble&s;t Theme of all who cultivate the politer Arts; as the continual Overflowings of
<PB REF="6">
your Bounty towards all Ob|jects of Di&s;tre&s;s daily endear you to every Heart that has any Feelings of Humanity: This your Princely Heavenly Di&s;po&s;ition is univer&s;ally felt and acknowledg|ed, and con&s;ider'd with all its Circum&s;tances without a Pa|rallel.</P>
<P>That your Royal Highne&s;s may long continue the Muni|ficent Encourager of Arts and Letters, an Example to Princes of public Spiritedne&s;s, Huma|nity, and Conde&s;cen&s;ion, is the ardent Wi&s;h of every hone&s;t <HI>Briton:</HI> For notwith&s;tanding all our Divi&s;ions, the Voice of the whole Nation is unanimous in

praying for your Life, Honour, and Pro&s;perity: And this we &s;hould do from Motives of In|tere&s;t and Self-love, were we not impell'd to it by Gratitude and Duty.</P>
