<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>I NOW offer to the Public, the &s;ub&s;tance of tho&s;e ob&s;erva|tions
on the de&s;cription and puni&s;hment of Crimes, which,
in the di&s;charge of my duty, as Profe&s;&s;or of the Law of
Scotland in the Univer&s;ity of Edinburgh, I have for &s;ome
years had occa&s;ion to deliver, as part of a cour&s;e of Aca|demical
Lectures. And when I give them this form, for
which I cannot plead the &s;ame obligation, I am &s;en&s;ible that
&s;ome apology is due to my countrymen, and more e&s;pecially
to my Brethren at the Bar, for the boldne&s;s of the under|taking.</P>
<P>IN one, however, and the principal excu&s;e, I hope to be
in &s;ome mea&s;ure anticipated by the reader. It is this: That
I am not profe&s;&s;ing to give him new light on a &s;ubject which
has been already handled by accurate and able authors; but
am only introducing him to the elements of a part of our
practice, upon which, important as it is, the lawyer may
almo&s;t be &s;aid to be without one printed authority to re|&s;ort,
to.</P>
<P>WHEN I &s;ay &s;o, I am far from intending (I know indeed
that &s;uch an attempt would be fruitle&s;s, and prudence, if
<PB N="xxxviii" REF="31">
not a &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice, would re&s;train me) to depreciate the me|rits
of the <HI>Treati&s;e concerning the Law of Scotland in Matters Cri|minal,</HI>
publi&s;hed in 1678, by that eloquent and ingenious law|yer,
Sir George Mackenzie. Certainly, whatever may be its
imperfections, his work was a valuable pre&s;ent to the lawyers
of his day; and this I may &s;afely &s;ay, that if we were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of any general &s;y&s;tem applicable to the practice of our times,
and written with the &s;ame learning and ingenuity, or contain|ing
the like detail of the judgments of Court, and of the rules
of our municipal cu&s;tom, the pre&s;ent publication would never
have &s;een the light. But it is well known, that with the ex|ception
of <HI>Maclaurin's Criminal Ca&s;es,</HI> and tho&s;e &s;ince pub|li&s;hed
by Mr Arnot, which are but a partial &s;election, and
do not propo&s;e to give any general expo&s;ition of the law,
later times have added almo&s;t nothing to our &s;tock of know|ledge
in this department. It is true that Er&s;kine, in his va|luable
In&s;titute of the Law of Scotland, profe&s;&s;es to treat of
the rules as well of our Criminal as of our Civil Practice.
But of this part of his work, which at any rate is much too
brief to be of any material &s;ervice in real bu&s;ine&s;s, I may
be allowed to &s;ay, (for in this I am not pretending to lead,
but am following the public opinion), that it is not of the
&s;ame high authority as the other; nor has been formed upon
the &s;ame accurate and exten&s;ive re&s;earch into the records
and deci&s;ions of Court, which are the only key to the pe|culiar
practice of Scotland re&s;pecting crimes. The &s;ame re|mark
is no le&s;s applicable to Mr Forbes's In&s;titute of the Cri|minal
Law; which is little more than a &s;et of ha&s;ty notes of
the contents of our &s;tatutes, without any inquiry into what
has been argued or decided.</P>
<P>THUS, on the whole, the lawyer has to gain his know|ledge
of this, certainly the noble&s;t and mo&s;t intere&s;ting part
<PB N="xxxix" REF="32">
of his profe&s;&s;ion, from the peru&s;al of one work, compo&s;ed up|wards
of a century ago, and in times &s;o very different from
the pre&s;ent, that, even if it were in every in&s;tance an accu|rate
and faithful delineation of the law and practice as they
then &s;tood; &s;till it would be found to give a very defective,
and often erroneous account of what is now the law, and
to require a very ample commentary, to accommodate it to
the u&s;es of our day.</P>
<P>THIS will not appear &s;urpri&s;ing to one who con&s;iders the
great change which has happened &s;ince the time of Sir
George Mackenzie, in the manners, and temper, and way of
thinking of the nation; by which the &s;tate of its Criminal
Law, and its application to real bu&s;ine&s;s, mu&s;t always, in a
great mea&s;ure, be affected. For although, in any tolerably well
governed country, the deci&s;ion of an individual ca&s;e ought,
and in general does depend, not on the wi&s;hes and feelings
of the people, or any part of the people, with re&s;pect to the
per&s;ons concerned, but &s;olely on the letter of the law and
the &s;tate of the fact; yet the general &s;pirit of that law will
always, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, be bent and accommodated to the
temper and exigencies of the times; directing its &s;everity
again&s;t tho&s;e crimes which the manners of the age breed a
direct abhorrence of, or which the pre&s;ent condition of the
people renders peculiarly hurtful in their con&s;equences to
private or to public peace. The method, too, of detecting
crimes, and of carrying on the trial, mu&s;t be affected by the
manners of the people; &s;ince the cour&s;e of proce&s;s will na|turally
vary, according as there is more or le&s;s danger that
ju&s;tice will be perverted, or fru&s;trated, by fal&s;ehood and
corruption, by private malice, or by the rancorous animo|&s;ity
of civil di&s;&s;en&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="xl" REF="33">
THE law of civil rights undergoes its changes too, as the
&s;tate of a people in regard to its political &s;ituation alters;
but the changes are never &s;o rapid, nor &s;o exten&s;ive, as in
the criminal juri&s;prudence. One &s;trong rea&s;on for which is,
that with re&s;pect to the former, although it may often be a
&s;ubject of inquiry to the under&s;tanding, whether one or
other practice be the more expedient; yet in the greater
number of ca&s;es, our moral feelings are altogether indiffe|rent;
which they never can be on a que&s;tion whether
a particular action or cour&s;e of conduct is or is not a fit ob|ject
of puni&s;hment. There are &s;ome of our civil in&s;titu|tions,
which perhaps might be altered with advantage; but
&s;till there is no feeling of di&s;like or abhorrence of the per|&s;ons
who enjoy what the pre&s;ent law gives them; nor any
very &s;trong &s;ympathy and compa&s;&s;ion towards tho&s;e who
are deprived of &s;ome advantages, which, on a different plan,
might have fallen to their lot. And thus the practice of old
times extends to the pre&s;ent; without giving us any &s;hock or
unea&s;ine&s;s. Now, it is quite otherwi&s;e in the matter of
crimes. Take, for in&s;tance, the ca&s;e of witchcraft. The
po&s;&s;ibility of &s;uch a crime was once believed; and the me|thods
of detecting it were al&s;o thought to be properly, and
even ingeniou&s;ly, contrived. But we have recovered from
this &s;trange and mi&s;erable delu&s;ion: and I am &s;ure it will
not be di&s;puted, that even if the &s;tatute which forbids any
pro&s;ecution for this crime had not been enacted, yet the
manners and temper of the age would effectually have
abrogated the ancient law; and would have &s;uffered no
&s;uch trials to be attempted, as our ance&s;tors, at no very di|&s;tant
period, often witne&s;&s;ed without di&s;approbation.</P>
<P><PB N="xli" REF="34">
FROM this natural corre&s;pondence between the &s;tate of
the Criminal Law, and the condition of the people as to its
manners and ways of feeling, it will ea&s;ily be under&s;tood
why Sir George Mackenzie's treati&s;e &s;hould be defective in
its application to our pre&s;ent practice. For at the time of
its publication, this country had advanced but little in any
&s;ort of improvement; and indeed, whether we con&s;ider it
with re&s;pect to the admini&s;tration of its Government, its
internal di&s;cipline and oeconomy, or the opinions, temper,
and habits of the people, it was at that time utterly remote
from what Scotland has &s;ince become.</P>
<P>IN this penury, therefore, of information, having, in the
cour&s;e of my duty as Public Teacher of the Law, particularly
directed my attention to the department of Crimes; and ha|ving
gone over the whole &s;eries of the <HI>Books of Adjournal,</HI> (for
&s;o the records of the Court of Ju&s;ticiary are called); I hope
I may at lea&s;t be excu&s;ed for the attempt of &s;aving others
the labour of the like re&s;earch, for which not many
per&s;ons can be &s;uppo&s;ed to have either lei&s;ure or inclina|tion.</P>
<P>ONE other motive, and I tru&s;t not an unworthy one, has,
I confe&s;s, thus far at lea&s;t had weight with me, that it has
determined me to make this publication earlier, than per|haps
I &s;hould otherwi&s;e have been di&s;po&s;ed to. I mean the
de&s;ire of re&s;cuing the law of my native country from that
&s;tate of declen&s;ion in the e&s;teem of &s;ome part of the public,
into which, of late years, it &s;eems to have been falling;
owing, I am per&s;uaded, to this more than any other cau&s;e,
that they are ignorant of what it really is. This di&s;po&s;i|tion,
in particular, appears in tho&s;e multiplied references to
<PB N="xlii" REF="35">
the Criminal Law of England, and tho&s;e frequent and extrava|gant
encomiums on the Engli&s;h practice, in preference to our
own; which, in any point where the two differ, is calumniated
as rude and barbarous, nay is &s;ometimes even &s;poken of as
grievous and oppre&s;&s;ive. This is an opinion, which, for my
own part, I am unwilling to learn; and in which I have
not yet found any preceptor, who had &s;ufficient &s;kill or elo|quence
to per&s;uade me. So far from it, that all &s;uch in|vectives,
indecent and hurtful as they certainly are, appear
to me withal to be unju&s;t and groundle&s;s in them&s;elves; and
to proceed upon a very partial and narrow view of the &s;ub|ject.</P>
<P>THAT the Law of England re&s;pecting Crimes is a liberal
and enlightened &s;y&s;tem, (having gradually ripened, by the
experience of ages, among a people who well under&s;tand the
nature of a rational and moderate freedom); and that as
&s;uch,&mdash;as a body of written wi&s;dom,&mdash;it is entitled to de|ference,
and may with propriety be quoted in tho&s;e mat|ters
which our own cu&s;toms or &s;tatutes have not &s;ettled:&mdash;
All this, what rea&s;onable per&s;on will di&s;pute? Farther; I
will readily admit, that in many things our practice has not
yet attained to the &s;ame maturity and con&s;i&s;tency as that of
our &s;i&s;ter kingdom: That offences are not reduced, through|out,
in their de&s;cription and &s;everal divi&s;ions, to the &s;ame
orderly and &s;y&s;tematic &s;hape; and that we have &s;till to &s;ettle
many points of our form of proce&s;s, which have long cea&s;ed
to be the &s;ubject of controver&s;y in the Engli&s;h Courts. But
of all this, how true &s;oever, I have only to ob&s;erve, that
how &s;hould we expect to find the ca&s;e otherwi&s;e, in compa|ring
our law with that of a country, where, from the much
greater number of di&s;&s;olute and pro$ligate people, and from
<PB N="xliii" REF="36">
the greater progre&s;s of every, refinement, and of every &s;ort of
corruption. crimes are both more frequent, and far more vari|ous
in their nature, than among our&s;elves; &s;o that through
the greater number of trials, and the repeated application
to every &s;ort of offence, their law forms a more complete
&s;y&s;tem, and extends its rules, drawn from actual deci&s;ions,
to a greater number of que&s;tions. But will it therefore be
&s;aid, that, purely by way of fixing things, it would be right
to extend the whole of this enormous code to Scotland,
where the &s;ame evils are not yet known, and the &s;ame que&s;|tions
have not yet occurred? Or, on the other hand, is it to
be conceived, that there would be good &s;en&s;e or propriety
in adopting this or t'other article of the Engli&s;h practice,
without regard had to its &s;uitablene&s;s or analogy, either to
our general &s;y&s;tem, or to the circum&s;tances of the depart|ment
of practice on which it is to be engrafted? Surely
it is a &s;hort&s;ighted and narrow wi&s;dom, which thus takes
up the &s;everal points of practice &s;eparately and by them|&s;elves;
when nothing is more certain, than that every one
part has more or le&s;s relation to another; and that many
things, which, con&s;idered &s;ingly, may &s;eem to be too rigo|rous,
or too indulgent, are, however, when examined as
parts of one whole, found to be neither way exce&s;&s;ive, but
altogether &s;uitable and proper; being coupled to other provi|&s;ions
of an oppo&s;ite tendency, which &s;erve to counteract them,
and to hinder the evil that might otherwi&s;e en&s;ue. Now,
if this be true of the different parts of any one &s;y&s;tem of
law, it ought to teach us the greate&s;t diffidence and caution
in comparing the laws of different countries, even when both
are fully known to us; and much more, (as in our ca&s;e),
when our acquaintance with one of them is &s;o imperfect.</P>
<P><PB N="xliv" REF="37">
AMONG many in&s;tances that might be given, I &s;hall men|tion
but one, of this fancied excellence of the Law of Eng|land
being in a great mea&s;ure a delu&s;ion, which has &s;prung
from the looking to only one rule in the criminal proce&s;s,
without attending to the others. What I allude to is the
complaint which we often hear, of our want of the peremp|tory
challenge of the jurors, and of that punctilious and
critical preci&s;ion re&s;pecting the terms of the indictment
and record, which is ob&s;erved in the Engli&s;h Courts. But
tho&s;e who expatiate on this grievance, entirely forget,
that, (except in ca&s;e of trea&s;on, by provi&s;ion of modern
&s;tatutes), no pri&s;oner in England &s;ees his indictment, or
knows what the charge again&s;t him is, till he &s;tands ar|raigned
on it in the face of Court; and that he is till then
in equal ignorance who the per&s;ons are that are &s;ummon|ed
to his jury, and who the witne&s;&s;es that are to be u&s;ed
again&s;t him. Whereas with us, he mu&s;t have full infor|mation
in all the&s;e important articles, fifteen days at lea&s;t
before his trial; and has thus far better opportunity than
the pri&s;oner in any trial before an Engli&s;h Court, to di&s;co|ver
and prepare any rea&s;onable objections that may lie to
the indictment, witne&s;&s;es, or jurors, or any of them. He has
too with us the farther advantage, in every in&s;tance, of Coun|&s;el
to addre&s;s the jury, and conduct his defence; which
no pri&s;oner in England has upon the i&s;&s;ue of guilty or not
guilty, in any capital ca&s;e, except in trials for trea&s;on. And
here, with reference to the indulgence which is &s;hown in
the&s;e particulars to &s;uch who are under trial for that high
crime, I cannot forbear to in&s;ert the ob&s;ervations of Sir Mi|chael
Fo&s;ter on that occa&s;ion. &startq;The furni&s;hing the pri&s;oner
with the names, profe&s;&s;ions, and places of abode of the
witne&s;&s;es and jury, &s;o long before the trial, may &s;erve many
bad purpo&s;es, which are too obvious to be mentioned. One
<PB N="xlv" REF="38">
good purpo&s;e, and but one it may &s;erve. It giveth the
pri&s;oner an opportunity of informing him&s;elf of the cha|racter
of the witne&s;&s;es and jury. But this &s;ingle advan|tage
will weigh very little, in the &s;cale of ju&s;tice or &s;ound
policy, again&s;t the many bad ends that may be an&s;wered
by it. However, if it weigheth any thing in the &s;cale of
ju&s;tice, the Crown is entitled to the &s;ame opportunity of
&s;ifting the character of the pri&s;oner's witne&s;&s;es.&endq;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crown Law, p. 250.</NOTE> Surely
it ought to be a le&s;&s;on to us, of the moderation and diffi|dence
to be ob&s;erved with re&s;pect to all opinions on &s;ubjects
of this kind, when we find this able and excellent author,&mdash;
an author too, who has di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf as a popular
lawyer, and &s;trenuous advocate in the cau&s;e of freedom,&mdash;
thus expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf rather in di&s;prai&s;e of the&s;e humane
provi&s;ions; which to us, who are habituated to them, as the
ordinary cour&s;e of proce&s;s, &s;eem to be indi&s;pen&s;ible to a fair
and equitable trial.</P>
<P>ANOTHER topic, on which al&s;o it is not uncommon to hear
encomiums pa&s;&s;ed at our own expence, is the greater huma|nity
of the Engli&s;h practice, which requires the unanimity
of the Twelve Jurors in their verdict. But, (to pa&s;s over all
inquiries concerning the &s;ub&s;tance of this rule); if the jury
mu&s;t be unanimous in their voice, they are however warrant|ed
to convict, and even in capital ca&s;es are in the u&s;e of do|ing
&s;o, upon the te&s;timony, if po&s;itive and explicit, of a &s;ingle
witne&s;s: A &s;ort of proof, how reputable &s;oever the witne&s;s,
which no Scots Jury can lawfully pay regard to, in any the
mo&s;t incon&s;iderable ca&s;e. Add to this, that the pri&s;oner in
Scotland has the &s;ame aid of Court, as the pro&s;ecutor, for
compelling his witne&s;&s;es to appear. Likewi&s;e, every witne&s;s
that is produced again&s;t the pri&s;oner, has right to &s;ee his de|claration
<PB N="xlvi" REF="39">
cancelled before depo&s;ing on the trial; &s;o as he
may be at ab&s;olute freedom in giving his evidence upon oath.
The witne&s;&s;es too are examined out of the pre&s;ence of
each other, which obviates any ri&s;k of a combination again&s;t
the pri&s;oner; and after being examined and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, no
witne&s;s can again be called on, to explain what he has &s;aid,
nor to &s;upply omi&s;&s;ions: Things, (as I under&s;tand it), all or
mo&s;t of them quite foreign to the Engli&s;h form of proce&s;s,
where the oppo&s;ite practices are e&s;tabli&s;hed, and are even
thought to be e&s;&s;ential, (and po&s;&s;ibly they are &s;o as matters
are managed with them), to the execution of criminal ju&s;tice.
Notice may al&s;o be taken of the jealou&s;y which actuates our
cu&s;tom, of all intercour&s;e between the Judge and jury. In
&s;o much that the verdict, once delivered into Court, can|not
on any pretence be retracted, nor even amended or
explained, but mu&s;t be received and taken with all its
imperfections, how glaring &s;oever, on its head. An Engli&s;h
jury, on the contrary, are conver&s;ed with, reinclo&s;ed, que|&s;tioned
and in&s;tructed by the Court, without any manner of
re&s;traint.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, the whole train of proceedings in this or any
other country, mu&s;t be taken into con&s;ideration, in judging
of any part. And if upon a complex view of the entire
proce&s;s, the pri&s;oner appears to have a fair and equitable trial,
in which innocence runs no ri&s;k of being en&s;nared or &s;ur|pri&s;ed;
it is all that a rea&s;onable man can wi&s;h for, and all
perhaps that is attainable to human wi&s;dom.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crown Law, p. 231.</NOTE> &startq;It is impo&s;|&s;ible&endq;
(&s;ays Fo&s;ter) &startq;in a &s;tate of imperfection to keep
clear of all inconveniences; though wi&s;dom will always
direct us to the cour&s;e which is &s;ubject to the fewe&s;t
and the lea&s;t, and this is the utmo&s;t that human wi&s;dom
<PB N="xlvii" REF="40">
can do.&endq; Now I think it is impo&s;&s;ible, that any per&s;on
of candour, who will attend to our cour&s;e of trial from the
out&s;et to the clo&s;e, &s;hall &s;eriou&s;ly believe that the pri&s;oner
has not all humane attention &s;hown to his condition, and all
due provi&s;ion made for his ju&s;t defence.</P>
<P>THESE ob&s;ervations re&s;pect the compari&s;on of our Criminal
Law with that of England, in the important matter of the
form of trial; and as far as concerns the &s;ecurity of inno|cence,
I &s;ee no rea&s;on to think, that there is any di&s;advan|tage
on our &s;ide.</P>
<P>I THINK it may al&s;o be doubted, whether the complaint
is better founded re&s;pecting that part of our &s;y&s;tem, which
lodges the power of pro&s;ecution with a public officer, the
Lord Advocate; by whom it is exerci&s;ed according to his
own judgment and di&s;cretion. For what are the evils,
which have been found in practice to attend this plan of ac|cu&s;ation?
Or is it not rather certain, that to this very cour&s;e
of proceeding, which places the entire re&s;pon&s;ibility for all
pro&s;ecutions with one individual of high rank and reputa|tion,
(who therefore, on his own account, will be cautious
and re&s;erved in the exerci&s;e of his powers), we owe the
&s;ingular and con&s;tant moderation, which has prevailed,
time out of mind, in the admini&s;tration of this part of pub|lic
ju&s;tice. Certainly, it cannot be di&s;puted, that by this
contrivance, the pro&s;ecutor is mo&s;t effectually removed from
the contagion of that popular prejudice, either for or again&s;t
the accu&s;ed, which is apt to ari&s;e in any ca&s;e of an extraor|dinary
or intere&s;ting nature. And with re&s;pect to the ri&s;k
of the influence of the Crown; it is true, that in an arbitra|ry
government, where the whole frame and order of things
<PB N="xlviii" REF="41">
tends to make the favour of the Sovereign the chief ob|ject
of regard, and the &s;ole means of preferment, &s;uch an
in&s;titution might be made an engine of inju&s;tice. But
there is no inference from thence to the &s;ituation of
things in this country; where &s;uch is the care of freedom,
the love of ju&s;tice, and &s;uch the high influence of the popular
part of the con&s;titution, that any per&s;on holding the office
of Lord Advocate who &s;hould &s;train his powers, or pervert
them to oppre&s;&s;ive purpo&s;es, would injure alike his own re|putation
and fortune, and the &s;ervice of the Crown. And
as, on the one hand, the inhabitants of Scotland have no|thing
to fear, and in truth have never &s;uffered, (&s;ince the Re|volution
at lea&s;t), from the privileges of this office; &s;o, on the
other it is impo&s;&s;ible to deny the high and exten&s;ive benefits
which attend it, in maintaining the police of the country, and
&s;ecuring the pro&s;ecution of every criminal who&s;e ca&s;e requires
it, without any trouble, or a &s;hilling even of expence, to the
party injured. In that re&s;pect the rule of the Engli&s;h &s;y&s;tem,
which in ordinary ca&s;es commits the pro&s;ecution only to that
party, and lays on him the whole care and expence of obtain|ing
a conviction, &s;eems at lea&s;t, (and, if I have not been
mi&s;informed<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Since writing the&s;e remarks, I have &s;een <HI>a Treati&s;e on the Police of the Me|tropolis,</HI> (written by an author who has the be&s;t opportunities of ob&s;erving the operation of the Engli&s;h &s;y&s;tem of pro&s;ecution), which makes a heavy, and &s;eemingly well grounded complaint, of the great ob&s;tacles to the execution of ju&s;tice which ari&s;e from that &s;ource. See Chap. X.</NOTE>, this is felt and complained of in their prac|tice),
to be le&s;s advantageou&s;ly contrived for repre&s;&s;ing the
growth of crimes.</P>
<P><PB N="xlix" REF="42">
IN regard to another important point, the determining of
the proper puni&s;hment of a crime when proved. I know
&s;ome have imagined that the law of England, which fixes
the matter by the preci&s;e letter of a &s;tatute, is preferable to
ours, which in a great number of in&s;tances leaves it to the
di&s;cretion of the Judge. Yet it is to this part of our &s;y&s;tem,
that we are perhaps chiefly indebted for the gentlene&s;s of
our puni&s;hments; which, compared with tho&s;e u&s;ed for the
&s;ame offences by other nations, is, generally &s;peaking, mo&s;t
eminent; but which, neverthele&s;s, we have hitherto found
&s;ufficient to maintain a greater degree of good order and
peace, than exi&s;ts in any other country &s;o far advanced as
this in the arts and re&s;inements of life, and con&s;equently &s;o
much expo&s;ed to the vices which attend them.</P>
<P>THAT our law is more rigorous than that of England in
regard to certain articles, where, unhappily, there has of late
been &s;o much occa&s;ion to compare the two; this I feel as
little inclination as power to di&s;pute. Our ancient &s;tatutes
animadverted with &s;everity on tho&s;e offences, which the
factious and unruly temper of the inhabitants of this coun|try
made it indi&s;pen&s;ible to repre&s;s. And although it might
have been expected, that in &s;o long a period of increa&s;ing
pro&s;perity, and of mild and equitable government, as has
elap&s;ed &s;ince the late&s;t of the&s;e laws, this vice of our di&s;po|&s;ition
might in &s;ome mea&s;ure have been corrected; yet have
we, in the events of our own day, &s;een too much rea&s;on to
commend in this particular the wi&s;dom of our Legi&s;lature,
and to be thankful for the powers which they have be&s;towed
upon our Courts.</P>
<P><PB N="l" REF="43">
BUT explain this in&s;tance any way, it never will decide
the que&s;tion as to the general temper of our law; of which
if any one wi&s;hes to form a ju&s;t opinion, let him attend to
the incon&s;iderable number of lives which fall a forfeit to its
rules. I am certain that I am within the truth, when I men|tion,
that on an average of thirty years preceding the year
1797, the executions for all Scotland have not exceeded &s;ix in
a year. For a period of fifteen years, preceding the 1&s;t May
1782, the number of per&s;ons who &s;uffered death at Edinburgh,
(where by far the greater number of capital trials take
place), amounted only to twenty-three; that is, in every
two years only three per&s;ons &s;uffered death. And as to
the inferior puni&s;hments, I have it from good authority,
that one quarter-&s;e&s;&s;ions, for the &s;ingle town of Manche&s;ter,
have &s;ent more felons to the plantations, than all the Scots
Judges do for ordinary in a twelvemonth. Near thirty
years ago,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vol. iv. p. 18.</NOTE> when Judge Black&s;tone fir&s;t publi&s;hed his Com|mentaries,
that author remarked, and expre&s;&s;ed his regret,
that there were then no fewer than one hundred and &s;ixty
offences, which had been declared by act of Parliament
to be felonies without benefit of clergy. At the large&s;t al|lowance,
and taking in all that are provided for at common
law, as well as by &s;tatute, (of which la&s;t a great propor|tion
have long been completely ob&s;olete), our li&s;t of capital
crimes does not amount to more than a fourth part of that
number. Such is the law, which, by ill informed per&s;ons,
is reproached as &s;anguinary and tyrannical in compari&s;on of
others; and &s;uch the means, by which upwards of a mil|lion
and a half of people are &s;ecured in the enjoyment of
all the benefits of the mo&s;t improved &s;ociety.</P>
<P><PB N="li" REF="44">
I REPEAT it therefore, without fear of contradiction, that
generally &s;peaking, and with a view to the ordinary cour&s;e
of vulgar practice, (for by this the que&s;tion mu&s;t be decided),
our cu&s;tom of puni&s;hment is eminently gentle; and would
be ill exchanged, for the offenders at lea&s;t, and indeed I
think for the country at large, again&s;t a numerous li&s;t of
&s;pecial and &s;tatutory rules. For plain it is, that if ever we
come to e&s;tabli&s;h any &s;uch po&s;itive code, the puni&s;hments
mu&s;t needs be &s;tated high; becau&s;e the Judge could in no
ca&s;e go beyond them, and not only the young but the more
experienced offender mu&s;t be corrected. Whereas, by our
cu&s;tom, as it now is, that object is fully accompli&s;hed; and
&s;trict regard is at the &s;ame paid, (which wherever it is
practicable, is &s;urely de&s;irable), to the peculiar and equitable
circum&s;tances of each ca&s;e, as it occurs. Take for in&s;tance
the crime of theft. If a &s;tatute were now to be pa&s;&s;ed, fix|ing
the pains of the &s;everal degrees of that offence; is it to
be doubted that the &s;tealing of a hor&s;e, or an ox, or of goods
to the value of L. 10, or even of L. 5, mu&s;t be rated in the
&s;cale as a capital crime; and the Judge be nece&s;&s;itated to
pa&s;s &s;entence of death upon every one who &s;hall be con|victed
to that extent. But, owing to the di&s;cretion which,
in this re&s;pect has been repo&s;ed with our Judges; how fre|quently
does it happen, that, by rea&s;on of youth, or weak|ne&s;s
of intellect, or becau&s;e in&s;tigated by &s;ome old tran&s;gre&s;|&s;or,
or for other the like favourable circum&s;tance in the ca&s;e,
offenders of this degree e&s;cape with &s;ome inferior correc|tion?
Thus, though at fir&s;t &s;ight it may &s;eem paradoxical
to allege, that there is any advantage in having the pu|ni&s;hment
of crimes di&s;cretionary; yet certain it is, that the
operation of this &s;tate of things, in our practice, has not
been again&s;t the pannel, but highly in his favour.</P>
<P><PB N="lii" REF="45">
AND here, let me ob&s;erve, that to this very excellence,
(&s;o much extolled), of the definite pains of all crimes in
England, is owing the infinite number of pardons, and com|mutations
of puni&s;hment, which are there found indi&s;pen|&s;ible
to the admini&s;tration of criminal ju&s;tice; and which,
compared with tho&s;e that occur in our practice, are in the
proportion of at lea&s;t ten to one. A difference, which, con|&s;idered
in any point of view, and e&s;pecially with re&s;pect to
its influence in the important article of the prevention of
crimes, certainly will not be thought to be to our di&s;advan|tage.</P>
<P>ANOTHER point in which the cu&s;tom of the two countries
remarkably differs, is with re&s;pect to the puni&s;hment of new
crimes or modes of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. It &s;eems to be held in Eng|land,
that no Court has power to take cogni&s;ance of any new
offence, although highly pernicious, and approaching very
nearly to others which have been prohibited, until &s;ome &s;tatute
has declared it to be a crime, and a&s;&s;igned a puni&s;hment.
With us the maxim is directly the rever&s;e; that the Supreme
Criminal Court have an inherent power as &s;uch, competently
to puni&s;h, (with the exception of life and limb), every act
which is obviou&s;ly of a criminal nature; though it be &s;uch
which in time pa&s;t has never been the &s;ubject of pro&s;ecution.
And certainly this cour&s;e is at lea&s;t attended with two advan|tages.
To the public it is thus far beneficial, that the evil
is repre&s;&s;ed in its beginnings, and more effectually than it
ever can be by any &s;tatute: Becau&s;e all &s;tatutes are liable to
be partial and defective in their de&s;cription of new offences<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">This is particularly exemplified in England, in the long train of &s;tatutes which have been found nece&s;&s;ary to be pa&s;&s;ed with re&s;pect to the theft of certain commodities, and the receiving of &s;tolen goods.</NOTE>,
<PB N="liii" REF="46">
and thus the tran&s;gre&s;&s;or finds the means of eluding the
&s;anction; and the law it&s;elf falls into contempt. But it
is al&s;o a merciful cour&s;e to the offender; becau&s;e the crime
being cen&s;ured on its fir&s;t appearance, and before it has be|come
flagrant or alarming to the community, is re&s;trained
at that &s;ea&s;on by far milder correctives, than are afterwards
nece&s;&s;ary to be applied to it, when the growing evil has
come to require the pa&s;&s;ing of an expre&s;s law in that be|half.
Thus in England, the &s;ending of incendiary or threaten|ing
letters is puni&s;hed with death, in virtue of certain &s;ta|tutes,
which pa&s;&s;ed at a time when this &s;ort of wickedne&s;s pre|vailed.
But our Judges puni&s;hed the fir&s;t offender of this
&s;ort, (who&s;e trial was within the&s;e fifty years), with tran&s;|portation;
and it has never been found nece&s;&s;ary to &s;eek
authority for any higher or more rigorous judgment. The
&s;ame is true with re&s;pect to the corruption or alteration of
bills, promi&s;&s;ory-notes and the like, to the prejudice of the
acceptor; which by certain &s;tatutes is felony without bene|fit
of clergy in England, and is puni&s;hable with us at com|mon
law, with tran&s;portation. Many other examples might
be given. In &s;hort, if things are to be judged of upon the
te&s;timony of experience, and not according to the fallacious
conjectures of human wi&s;dom before the event; the inhabi|tants
of Scotland have no rea&s;on to envy the condition, with
re&s;pect to the admini&s;tration of Criminal Ju&s;tice, of any
other part of Europe.</P>
<P>WHILE I expre&s;s my&s;elf in the&s;e terms, let me not be
thought to intend pa&s;&s;ing a cen&s;ure on the practice of Eng|land,
as impolitic or cruel, in rearing up &s;o great a ma&s;s of
penal &s;tatutes upon &s;pecial tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions. I have no doubt
that their practice is good, and I will pre&s;ume of the wi&s;dom
<PB N="liv" REF="47">
of their Legi&s;lature that it is nece&s;&s;ary, in their &s;tate of
wealth, &s;ociety, and manners. I only mean to &s;ay, that ours
is in all probability at lea&s;t as well adapted to our own &s;itu|ation
in tho&s;e re&s;pects.</P>
<P>LET me add, that while I thus di&s;claim that &s;uper&s;titious
admiration of the Engli&s;h Law, which prevails among &s;ome
per&s;ons, and e&s;pecially, like other &s;uper&s;titions, among the
ignorant; and which would &s;et up that &s;y&s;tem as a &s;tandard
of perfection, after the likene&s;s whereof we are to reform and
new-model our own; yet on a proper occa&s;ion, and for a pro|per
purpo&s;e, I have been ready to avail my&s;elf of the important
a&s;&s;i&s;tance which its doctrines may often afford me. I have
already &s;aid, that as a great body of written and practical
rea&s;on, and recommended by the example of a free and en|lightened
people, it has every where, and certainly in our
country more than el&s;ewhere, (becau&s;e the form of our Go|vernment,
and the general &s;pirit of our juri&s;prudence are the
&s;ame with that of England), a &s;trong claim to deference and
regard. In matters, therefore, which depend on the com|mon
feelings of equity and right, and are not determined
otherwi&s;e by our municipal cu&s;tom, nor are anywi&s;e in|volved
in it, I have made liberal u&s;e of the &s;entiments, and
&s;ometimes even of the words of the Engli&s;h writers on
law: An obligation, which, as their works cannot properly
be quoted as authorities in a book of Scots Law, I beg leave
in this place, once for all, to acknowledge.</P>
<P>HAVING &s;aid thus much of my motives towards the com|po&s;ition
of this work, I &s;hall &s;ubjoin a few words concern|ing
the plan and object of the work it&s;elf, and the &s;ources
whence I have drawn the doctrine which it contains.</P>
<P><PB N="lv" REF="48">
IN regard to the fir&s;t, a very &s;hort and &s;imple account
may be given: I mean to open up to the young lawyer the
Elements of our Criminal Practice; and to lay before him
&s;uch authorities and materials, as may &s;erve to guide him in
his future re&s;earches, and are not to be found in any of our
printed works. This, undoubtedly, and nothing higher, is
the main bent and &s;cope of my undertaking. I have no in|tention
of bringing forward a Philo&s;ophical treati&s;e of Cri|minal
Juri&s;prudence, in which the hi&s;tory of the human &s;pe|cies,
with re&s;pect to this branch of the &s;cience of law, is to
be traced; and an attempt made to a&s;certain, on ab&s;tract and
univer&s;al principles, the nature of the &s;everal offences, and
the application and proportion of puni&s;hments. Certainly
the&s;e are amu&s;ing and intere&s;ting di&s;qui&s;itions; but they do
not lie within his province, who&s;e attention has chiefly been
turned to the inve&s;tigation of one peculiar &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>NEITHER have I any intention of turning cen&s;or on our
practice; and of &s;ugge&s;ting changes and reformations, which
might fit it to &s;ome &s;tandard of higher perfection than our
forefathers had in view. For this is a very delicate ta&s;k
indeed; and which tho&s;e only, from whom their &s;cho|la&s;tic
vanity and gro&s;s ignorance of the real bu&s;ine&s;s of
life conceals its difficulty, will be forward to engage
in. Neverthele&s;s, when any thing in our &s;y&s;tem is con|fe&s;&s;edly
inconvenient or defective, (and in what &s;y&s;tem are
not &s;uch things to be found), I &s;hould conceive it impro|per
for me to ab&s;tain from pointing out that circum&s;tance
to attention. But in taking notice of it, I &s;hall ob&s;erve that
moderation and diffidence, which every per&s;on not abound|ing
in &s;elf-conceit, and who has lived to a certain age, and at|tained
to &s;ome experience, mu&s;t feel with regard to any opi|nion
<PB N="lvi" REF="49">
of his own, when oppo&s;ed to that of our forefathers,
and to the practice in time pa&s;t of the Judges of the land.
Still le&s;s &s;hall I think it rea&s;onable, where the occa&s;ion of|fers,
to omit calling the reader's attention to the peculiar
advantages, by which not a few parts of our Criminal &s;y&s;|tem
are di&s;tingui&s;hed. For it is truly doing him a &s;ervice,
to make him &s;en&s;ible of the many ble&s;&s;ings he enjoys under
the &s;ub&s;i&s;ting laws of his country.</P>
<P>BUT although, in the compo&s;ition of the&s;e &s;heets, I have
chiefly had in view the in&s;truction of the lawyer; yet
is not this &s;ort of knowledge entirely without its u&s;e even to
the individual, who has to govern his life and conduct in con|formity
to the precepts which they explain. It cannot but be
intere&s;ting to him as a man, to be acquainted with that &s;y&s;|tem
of rules and ordinances, according to which, as a citi|zen
of Scotland, he is to an&s;wer for his actions to his fellow
&s;ubjects, and to his Sovereign; and by which the trial of his
highe&s;t and deare&s;t concerns, his &s;tate and condition in &s;o|ciety,
his freedom, and even his life, mu&s;t be conducted and
decided. Certainly, he will have the better chance to
prove a good and u&s;eful member of the community, and to
demean him&s;elf well in all circum&s;tances, and towards all
per&s;ons, if he knows what the law has in every ca&s;e ordered;
and &s;ees the connection which the re&s;pective rights and du|ties
of the different orders of men have, with the maintain|ance
of that &s;tate of &s;ociety, and that form of Government,
under which he lives. Sir Michael Fo&s;ter<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Preface to his Di&s;cour&s;es on the Crown Law.</NOTE> hath truly &s;aid
on this head, &startq;The learning touching the&s;e &s;ubjects is mat|ter
of great and univer&s;al concernment. It merits, for
<PB N="lvii" REF="50">
rea&s;ons too obvious to be enlarged on, the attention of
every man living. For no rank, no elevation in life, and
let me add, no conduct, how circum&s;pect &s;oever, ought to
tempt a rea&s;onable man to. conclude, that the&s;e inquiries
do not, nor po&s;&s;ibly can concern him. A moment's cool
reflection on the utter in&s;tability of human affairs, and the
numberle&s;s unfore&s;een events which a day may bring forth,
will be &s;ufficient to guard any man, con&s;cious of his own
infirmities, again&s;t a delu&s;ion of this kind.&endq;</P>
<P>IN regard to the &s;ources from which my information has
been drawn. I &s;hall begin with a word or two re&s;pecting the
Law of Rome; which &s;ome may think de&s;erving of notice,
not only as being the law of a great and civilized people,
but even as having preten&s;ions to &s;ome &s;ort of authority in
our Courts. But it &s;eems to be the better opinion, (and
&s;uch are the &s;entiments of Sir Thomas Craig, and of Lord
Stair<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>&startq;Nos tamen, in hoc qualicunque regno, Romanorum legibus ita obligamur, qualenus legibus naturae, et rectae rationi congruunt.&endq; Craig de Feudis, lib.</HI> 1. <HI>Dieg.</HI> 2. <HI>No.</HI> 14.</P>
<P>&startq;Our cu&s;toms, as they have ari&s;en mainly from equity, &s;o they are al&s;o from the civil, canon, and feudal laws, from which the terms, tenors and forms of them are much borrowed; and therefore, the&s;e (e&s;pecially the civil law), have weight with us, namely, in ca&s;es where a cu&s;tom is not yet formed; But none of the&s;e have with us the authority of law, and therefore, are only received ac|cording to their equity and expediency, <HI>&s;ecundum bonum et aequum.</HI>&endq; Stair, b. 1. tit. 1. No. 16.</P></NOTE>), that even in the civil department, the Roman Law
never attained to a binding authority, like that of our own
cu&s;toms or &s;tatutes; nor came to be in any other &s;en&s;e our
law, than as it was long ago, in particular matters, made a
rule of judgment, and thus incorporated into our common
law by the deci&s;ions of our Courts; or farther than it is
<PB N="lviii" REF="51">
agreeable to equity and rea&s;on, or &s;uitable to our &s;ituation,
and analogous to the re&s;t of our &s;y&s;tem. If this be true of
the civil department, much more mu&s;t it be &s;o of the cri|minal.
Indeed, if there were even nothing more in the ca&s;e
but this, that our whole judicial e&s;tabli&s;hments, and modes
of trial, are utterly remote from any thing that was known
among the Romans; this, of it&s;elf, is &s;uch a difference, as
at once &s;ets up an in&s;urmountable bar to the authority of the
Roman code. For nothing is more certain, than that the&s;e
arrangements have a powerful influence on the rules them|&s;elves
of criminal ju&s;tice, and the mode of arguing in cri|minal
matters.</P>
<P>INDEPENDENTLY of this, the truth &s;eems to be, that there
are in every ca&s;e very great ob&s;tacles to the transferring of
the Criminal Law of any one nation to another. Becau&s;e
in any country, the frame and character of this part of its
laws, has always a much clo&s;er dependence upon the pecu|liar
circum&s;tances of the people, than the detail of its cu&s;|toms
and regulations in mo&s;t of the ordinary affairs of ci|vil
life. The rules of deci&s;ion re&s;pecting contracts and ob|ligations,
which make a great branch of civil bu&s;ine&s;s, mu&s;t,
in all countries that are tolerably civilized, be governed in
the main by principles of a general and independent nature;
by the common feelings of right and wrong, which are not
liable to be very much affected by the &s;tate of the Govern|ment
of the country, or of its political in&s;titutions. It can|not
be a matter of any concern to the State, or the admini|&s;trators
of public affairs, by what rule the ju&s;tice of a claim
of debt, or the right flowing from any fort of common con|tract,
&s;hall be tried: They have nothing to do in &s;uch af|fairs;
nor can any rules be laid down re&s;pecting them, of
<PB N="lix" REF="52">
which it can before hand be &s;aid, how they are to operate
in tho&s;e matters where the State may eventually come to
have an intere&s;t. But it is quite otherwi&s;e as to the law re|&s;pecting
crimes; which has a near relation to the di&s;tinc|tions
of rank among the people, the functions of their Ma|gi&s;trates,
their in&s;titutions and national objects, their reli|gion,
their &s;tate of Government, and their po&s;ition with re|&s;pect
to other powers. Now, take the Romans at any pe|riod
of their hi&s;tory; there are &s;o few points of re&s;emblance
between them and us on any of tho&s;e matters, that no one
can for a moment &s;eriou&s;ly reflect on it, without perceiving
that what was natural, &s;uitable, and convenient in their &s;i|tuation,
has not, from that circum&s;tance, any &s;ort of re|commendation
to us.</P>
<P>THIS is certainly true in regard to the Roman Law during
the time of the Republic; and applies to it almo&s;t equally
in that more advanced &s;tate, in which we are be&s;t acquaint|ed
with it. It was by no means to be looked for, (and the
rea&s;ons again&s;t it are obvious), that the criminal &s;y&s;tem
&s;hould ripen and refine under the Emperors, to the &s;ame de|gree
as did the law of civil rights. Nor did it prove &s;o in
fact. It was on the contrary here, as might be expected,
that the jealou&s;y and violence of every bad Prince, and
the &s;hort-&s;ighted policy of every weak one, chiefly di&s;play|ed
it&s;elf. Hence, in this department, in&s;tead of tho&s;e
equitable di&s;tinctions and comprehen&s;ive views, &s;o eminent
in the civil branch, we find a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of detached and
&s;pecific, and often incon&s;i&s;tent ordinances; which were made
according to the demands of the time, or the temper of
the reigning Prince, and were probably, mo&s;t of them,
no longer ob&s;erved than while tho&s;e occa&s;ions la&s;ted.
Accordingly, although our lawyers have been in the u&s;e of
<PB N="lx" REF="53">
re&s;orting to the Roman code for a confirmation of their
arguments in criminal matters; and though of old they
even &s;ometimes &s;et it forth in the preamble of indictments
as law, (in like manner as they did the Canon and Jewi&s;h
laws); yet I cannot find that the Imperial con&s;titutions ever
were incorporated into the municipal &s;y&s;tem, or held to po&s;|&s;e&s;s
an authority, farther than as &s;ome of them occa&s;ionally
expre&s;s a rea&s;onable &s;entiment, with a brevity and an ele|gance
which are fit to recommend it. For the&s;e rea&s;ons,
though I have not neglected the authorities of the Roman
&s;y&s;tem, in ca&s;es where I find that they have actually been
regarded in our municipal practice; yet I have not other|wi&s;e
engaged in frequent or very exten&s;ive di&s;cu&s;&s;ions with
re&s;pect to them.</P>
<P>IF I have thus paid but little regard to the compila|tions
of Ju&s;tinian; &s;till le&s;s have I thought it material to
detain the reader on every occa&s;ion, with a &s;crutiny into the
&s;entiments of the numerous commentators on them in mo|dern
times. Not that I mean to &s;peak of their works as
u&s;ele&s;s or nugatory in them&s;elves; but that it were very
ab&s;urd to look into any of them for an exhibition of the
practice of Scotland, which tho&s;e foreign authors could know
nothing about. And as to the di&s;cu&s;&s;ions which they &s;ome|times
enter into of more general topics, &s;uch as the nature
of the &s;everal crimes, the competency of the &s;everal de|fences
and the like; though many of their ob&s;ervations are
ju&s;t and rational, yet for the mo&s;t part they teach nothing
more than any man of plain &s;en&s;e, with a little attention to
the &s;ubject, will readily, and to as good purpo&s;e, make out
for him&s;elf. As Sir George Mackenzie has ob&s;erved with
<PB N="lxi" REF="54">
re&s;pect to the quotation of authorities<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Works of Sir George Mackenzie, vol. ii. p. 353.</NOTE>, &startq;he darkens his
own cau&s;e, when ju&s;t, who u&s;es the&s;e to ignorant people;
and he le&s;&s;ens his own e&s;teem, who thinks he needs them
among men of better &s;en&s;e.&endq; Be&s;ides, if in &s;uch matters
we are to re&s;ort to authority, for confirmation of what equi|ty
and rea&s;on dictate, the works of the Engli&s;h lawyers are
here entitled to the preference. Both by rea&s;on of the near|er
analogy of the Engli&s;h practice to our own; and becau&s;e
the general principles upon which a que&s;tion turns are laid
down by tho&s;e authors, and the doctrine illu&s;trated with a
preci&s;ion of language, and &s;oundne&s;s of head, not inferior
to what appears in the works of any lawyer or commenta|tor
of other countries.</P>
<P>THE main &s;tore from which I have drawn the materials
of this treati&s;e, is therefore the books of adjournal (or re|cords
of the Court of Ju&s;ticiary), containing the pleadings
of the Bar and the judgments of Court; and which ex|tend,
(though with &s;everal interruptions in the &s;ixteenth cen|tury,
and one of &s;ix years<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">This is from 1655 to 1661.</NOTE> in the &s;eventeenth), from Novem|ber
1524, down to the pre&s;ent time. I have gone over the
whole with attention, (in which I have had the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
a gentleman particularly &s;killed in the decyphering of ancient
manu&s;cripts<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Mr William Ander&s;on, writer in Edinburgh.</NOTE>): and though I am far from doubting that
very many things, both curious and important, &s;till remain
buried there, to reward the indu&s;try of any one after me
who &s;hall engage in the like re&s;earch; yet I flatter my&s;elf
<PB N="lxii" REF="55">
that I have al&s;o brought &s;ome things to light, which at lea&s;t
were not univer&s;ally known. There is, in the Advocates
Library, a manu&s;cript abridgment of the records of Ju&s;ti|ciary;
and of this I have al&s;o made u&s;e, (but never with|out
marking it as my authority), for tho&s;e periods of which
the original records have peri&s;hed; for this abridgment
mu&s;t have been made at a time when the books of ad|journal
were more complete than they are now. The&s;e
memorials of our cu&s;tom, along with Lord Roy&s;ton's Ma|nu&s;cript
Notes upon Mackenzie, which contain many judi|cious
remarks and much valuable information, have been the
main ground-work of this undertaking. In them&s;elves they
are the &s;ure&s;t of any; and in order that the reader may be
enabled to judge for him&s;elf, how far they &s;upport me in
my conclu&s;ions, I have, in every in&s;tance where it &s;eemed
material or u&s;eful, laid the pa&s;&s;ages them&s;elves of the record
under his eye, in the form of notes, along with the doctrine
of which they are the vouchers and confirmations. It would
be ra&s;h to &s;uppo&s;e, that in the cour&s;e of &s;o long a work &s;ome
inaccuracies in point of date or quotation may not have crept
in: but as I have not &s;pared pains on this head, (being very
&s;en&s;ible that the value of any performance of this kind de|pends
entirely on its accuracy); &s;o I hope that they &s;hall
not be found numerous, nor of much importance.</P>
<P>LAST of all, in regard to the order I have followed in
treating of the &s;ubject: this is truly a point of le&s;s impor|tance
in explaining the &s;y&s;tem of Criminal than of Civil
Juri&s;prudence. Frequently the doctrine of one &s;pecies of
civil right cannot be under&s;tood, till that which con|cerns
another has been fully explained; and thus there is
an order of inquiry pointed out as the be&s;t, by the very
nature of the thing. But the law re&s;pecting one &s;ort of
<PB N="lxiii" REF="56">
crime &s;carcely ever &s;tands in &s;uch a relation to that which re|gards
another; &s;o that it is often an almo&s;t arbitrary matter,
to what &s;ubject the &s;tudent &s;hall fir&s;t direct his attention. I
have cho&s;en, therefore, to take up the &s;everal crimes in the or|der
rather of their frequency and practical importance, than
of their rank in other re&s;pects. Thus I begin with tho&s;e offen|ces
which are committed again&s;t individuals, and among
the&s;e with the offences again&s;t property; after which fol|low
the &s;everal modes of injuring an individual in his per&s;on
or his fame. Having exhau&s;ted the&s;e, I proceed to &s;uch of|fences
as more immediately concern the public; which,
after the example of Judge Black&s;tone, I have di&s;tributed
into &s;everal cla&s;&s;es: as they are ho&s;tile to the cour&s;e of pub|lic
ju&s;tice; to the public peace; to the police and public
oeconomy of the kingdom; or to its intere&s;t in point of
trade. The next divi&s;ion includes the high crimes of trea|&s;on,
&s;edition, and &s;ome others which are levelled directly
again&s;t the Sovereign and the State. And the la&s;t con&s;i&s;ts
of tho&s;e tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions which relate to God and to religion.</P>
<P>THE title of my pre&s;ent publication, does not embrace any
thing that has relation to the <HI>trial</HI> of crimes, or the <HI>execution</HI>
of criminal ju&s;tice. Before proceeding to the&s;e, which are
not the lea&s;t arduous part of &s;uch an undertaking, I have
thought it better to con&s;ult the judgment of the Public, with
re&s;pect to the manner in which I have treated that portion
of the &s;ubject which is now laid before them. At the &s;ame
time, if I &s;hould never find lei&s;ure to ab&s;olve this labour;
what is now publi&s;hed forms a whole by it&s;elf, which is in|dependent
of the other part, and in every place intelligible
without any knowledge of what relates to the form of trial.</P>

CRIMES.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">OF THE NATURE OF CRIMES.</HEAD>
<P>IN determining the extent of that part of the law which
has relation to CRIMES,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. I.</NOTE> I &s;hall be guided by the or|dinary
acceptation of that term, and &s;hall con&s;ider every act
as a crime, for which the law of Scotland has appointed
the offender to make &s;atisfaction to the public, be&s;ide re|pairing,
where that can be done, the injury which the indi|vidual
hath &s;u&s;tained. It is obvious, (and I do not think it
nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay more concerning the nature of crimes, as
contradi&s;tingui&s;hed to civil wrongs), that in exacting any
&s;uch atonement of him, the Legi&s;lature always proceed on
the opinion of an infringement on his part of that &s;ocial re|gard,
<PB N="2" REF="59">
which, as a citizen, he owes to the community; whe|ther
it be that he has violated their &s;ecurity, or their tran|quillity,
or has tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed with re&s;pect to &s;ome of tho&s;e other
articles of whole&s;ome government and regulation, which af|fect
the public polity and general welfare of the realm.</P>
<P>Neither, before I enter into the detail of the &s;everal of|fences,
&s;hall I occupy the reader with any inquiry concern|ing
the &s;ource of the right of inflicting puni&s;hment, an in|quiry
which would only be proper, (if it could then take
place), in the very beginnings of &s;ociety and legi&s;lation;
nor with an attempt to trace the natural hi&s;tory of crimes,
and of the e&s;tabli&s;hments for correcting them, through the
different periods of the &s;ocial &s;tate. For, though a re&s;earch
of this &s;ort would be a proper and mo&s;t intere&s;ting article in
a hi&s;tory of juri&s;prudence, a noble department certainly of
knowledge, and fit to employ an ingenious mind; yet it
does not fall within the compa&s;s of his undertaking, who on|ly
profe&s;&s;es to give a commentary on the &s;pecial laws of his
own country, as they actually &s;tand. Be&s;ides, if &s;uch an e&s;|&s;ay
were even in its proper place in a work upon this plan,
it would be rea&s;on &s;ufficient again&s;t engaging in it, that the
ta&s;k has already been performed by the hand of a great
matter in this line, (Lord Kames, in his Tract of Criminal
Law), who&s;e remarks if I were not to repeat, it could be
only out of the weak de&s;ire of avoiding the path which he
has pointed out to me, and not from any hope of guiding the
&s;tudent into a better.</P>
<P>If I avoid di&s;qui&s;itions of this &s;ort, which, if not very u&s;e|ful
in the daily practice of courts, might, however, be cu|rious
and amu&s;ing, and certainly would not be attended
with any danger of doing harm, &s;till le&s;s &s;hall I think it any
part of my duty, to enlarge at this time in ob&s;ervations on
<PB N="3" REF="60">
the due mea&s;ure, proportion, or application of puni&s;hments,
or on the &s;tyle, the objects, and proper qualities, of pe|nal
laws, which are rather the bu&s;ine&s;s of the political phi|lo&s;opher,
than of the lawyer, and on which &s;ubjects, let me
&s;ay, much hath been ra&s;hly written, in a loo&s;e and general
way, by authors but moderately &s;killed in the bu&s;ine&s;s of
life, and very unequal to the arduous ta&s;k of improving the
&s;cience of legi&s;lation. I will &s;ay farther, that I am deterred
from hazarding any a&s;&s;emblage of precepts towards tho&s;e ob|jects,
when I con&s;ider that even under the pen of able and
judicious authors, &s;uch as Sir William Black&s;tone, (and cer|tainly
I cannot mention a &s;tronger in&s;tance), the&s;e gene|ral
and prefatory articles have produced &s;o little, which is
not either &s;o trite and obvious, as &s;carcely to require being
taught, or el&s;e, is, in its application to particulars, &s;o liable
to modification and exception, from exigencies of &s;ituation,
or for other &s;pecial rea&s;ons, that truly we almo&s;t lo&s;e the
rule, in the attempt to turn it to any &s;ervice. I judge it
therefore more u&s;eful, as well as &s;afer, that any remarks of
this character &s;hould be introduced occa&s;ionally in the pro|gre&s;s
of the work, and with reference to particulars which
&s;ugge&s;t them; in which cour&s;e, the true meaning and ju&s;t li|mits
of tho&s;e maxims may more clearly be perceived, as
well as their truth or fal&s;ehood be more thoroughly tried,
than if they were only delivered in the ab&s;tract.</P>
<P>DECLINING,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Nature of Dole.</NOTE> therefore, to make any excur&s;ion into the&s;e
regions, I &s;hall begin, as a nece&s;&s;ary introduction to the ana|ly&s;is
of the &s;everal offences, with an explanation of the nature
of that dole, that malicious and wilful purpo&s;e, which, ac|cording
to all authorities, herein conformable to nature and
rea&s;on, is e&s;&s;ential to the guilt of any crime. But in deli|vering
<PB N="4" REF="61">
this general precept, tho&s;e authorities are not to be
under&s;tood in that &s;pecial and re&s;trained &s;en&s;e, wherein the
term has often been taken and pleaded in criminal ca&s;es; as
if it were always nece&s;&s;ary for the pro&s;ecutor, to bring evi|dence
of an intent to do the very thing which has been
done, and to do it out of enmity to the individual who has
been injured. In this very favourable &s;en&s;e to the pannel,
the maxim cannot be received into the law; for it would
tend to &s;creen many great offenders from puni&s;hment of their
tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions. And I think it is only true in this loo&s;er and
more general, but practical and rea&s;onable &s;en&s;e, in which
an Engli&s;h author<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Fo&s;ter's Crown Law, p. 256. <HI>et &s;eq.</HI></NOTE> of the fir&s;t judgment in tho&s;e matters,
has explained it; that the act mu&s;t be attended with &s;uch
circum&s;tances, as indicate the corrupt and malignant di&s;po|&s;ition
of the offender, the heart contemptuous of order, and
regardle&s;s of &s;ocial duty.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, it is not nece&s;&s;ary for the pro&s;ecutor, to
bring evidence of a &s;pecial purpo&s;e to injure the very per|&s;on
who has been the &s;ufferer on the occa&s;ion. In a trial,
for in&s;tance, for the crime of fire-rai&s;ing, it will not affect
the judgment of the Court, nor ought it of the Jury, that
the hou&s;e which has been con&s;umed is not the hou&s;e of
his enemy, which the pannel meant to de&s;troy, and to which
he applied the fire, but that of another per&s;on, to him un|known,
and to which, by the &s;hifting of the wind, or other
accident, the flames have been carried. The &s;ame is even
true in the ca&s;e of homicide, that crime to which a &s;pecial
malice might &s;eem more natural and proper than any other.
For if John make a thru&s;t at James, meaning to kill him,
and George, throwing him&s;elf between, receive the thru&s;t,
and die, who doubts that John &s;hall equally an&s;wer it, as if
<PB N="5" REF="62">
his mortal purpo&s;e had taken place upon James? Or if John
lay poi&s;on in &s;uch circum&s;tances, as &s;hew it to be intended
for a human creature, he &s;hall certainly die for it, though
it be accidentally taken by the per&s;on who is deare&s;t to him
upon earth, and whom, at the peril of his own life, he would
have redeemed from &s;uch a hazard. This was the opinion
of the Court, and never was doubted to be &s;ound law, in
the ca&s;e of Carnegie of Finhaven,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July and Augu&s;t 1728.</NOTE> who, ha&s;tily thru&s;ting at
Lyon of Bridgeton, who had in&s;ulted him, happened to kill
another per&s;on, the Earl of Strathmore, to whom he bore
all manner of regard. And the &s;ame in &s;ome mea&s;ure was
the de&s;cription of the ca&s;e of Matthew Hay, tried and con|victed
of murder, at Ayr, in May 1780. The intention of
this man was to poi&s;on a young woman, who was with child
to him. She, however, though &s;he ate of the food in which
the poi&s;on was mingled, &s;urvived the attempt, though injured
in her health; but her father and mother, who al&s;o ate of
it, were de&s;troyed. Certainly the ca&s;e was thus far more
unfavourable to him, that he could not but &s;ee the plain ha|zard
to tho&s;e who actually died, having thrown the poi&s;on
into the ve&s;&s;el, where the common me&s;s was cooking for the
family.</P>
<P>IN the next place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Nature of Dole.</NOTE> it is not even indi&s;pen&s;able, that the ma|lice
be directed again&s;t any one in particular. For if a man
wickedly fire among a multitude at random, or if he ma|liciou&s;ly
turn out a mad dog into the &s;treet, at a time when
it is full of pa&s;&s;engers, and a per&s;on is killed in con&s;equence
of this brutality; &s;urely any difference between &s;uch a ca&s;e
of indi&s;criminate malice, and one of &s;pecial hatred to an
individual, is all to the di&s;advantage of the offender, who
cannot be con&s;idered any otherwi&s;e than as a mon&s;ter, or
<PB N="6" REF="63">
enemy of the human race, that ought not to he &s;uffered
among men. A charge of this &s;ort was brought again&s;t
James Niven, in March 1796, of whom the libel related,
that having loaded a &s;mall cannon with powder, and a
bit of iron, and having pointed it up a lane or &s;treet of
common pa&s;&s;age, he there fired it off, at a time when two
per&s;ons were &s;tanding in the direction of the piece, and
others were pa&s;&s;ing along the lane; whereby one of the
per&s;ons fir&s;t mentioned was killed. The circum&s;tances of the
ca&s;e gave no rea&s;on to pre&s;ume, that the pannel was actuated
by &s;pecial enmity to any of the&s;e per&s;ons, who were all un|known
to him: Yet it was held upon the Bench, <HI>that if the
charge were proved, as laid,</HI> he was guilty of no lower crime
than murder. The Jury found a verdict in his favour.</P>
<P>NEITHER is it always nece&s;&s;ary to conviction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Nature of Dole.</NOTE> though it
is the ordinary and more frequent ca&s;e, that there be evi|dence
of a fixed intention on the part of the pannel, to do
the &s;ort of mi&s;chief which in the event has happened. If
indeed the thing happen accidentally, and in the pro&s;ecu|tion
al&s;o of &s;ome different and lawful act, from which the
pannel cannot rea&s;onably have any dread of the harm that
en&s;ues, this is exclu&s;ive of the notion of guilt: There is no
<HI>malus animus,</HI> no vice or corruption of purpo&s;e, to fix an evil
character on the deed. But if, on the contrary, the cir|cum&s;tances
indicate a wicked and malignant &s;pirit, a re&s;o|lution
to do &s;ome violent and atrocious mi&s;chief, though
it go to a greater length than the pannel is ab&s;olutely
bent upon, or take a cour&s;e &s;omewhat different from that
which he intends, it is clear, that in many ca&s;es it will
be all one, as if he fore&s;aw and intended the actual i&s;|&s;ue.
If a man lie in wait for his neighbour, with intent
<PB N="7" REF="64">
to do him &s;ome grievous bodily harm, as for in&s;tance to
ham&s;tring him, to cut out his tongue, or to give him an
outrageous beating, or the like, and the per&s;on is &s;o abu&s;ed
that he dies, either on the &s;pot, or afterwards of the con&s;e|quences
of the injury, the law knows no difference between
this and the dole of murder. He hath actually killed, and
cannot be &s;aid not to have willed it, having willed that
which put his neighbour in plain hazard of his life, and
which &s;hewed an utter indifference about the fate of his
neighbour, whether he were to live or die. Or again, if
one &s;et fire to his neighbour's corn in the barn-yard, mean|ing
to burn the corn, but the fire &s;preading catches the ad|joining
dwelling-hou&s;e, which is al&s;o con&s;umed, and the
inhabitants within it, this is a clear ground, on which the
author of the calamity may as well be indicted for murder,
as for fire-rai&s;ing.</P>
<P>IN the&s;e in&s;tances,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Nature of Dole.</NOTE> the actual i&s;&s;ue participates of the
nature of the original purpo&s;e, and the general malice
is followed by a mi&s;chief of that &s;ort, which is natu|rally
referrible to that &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition and temper of
mind in the offender. But what &s;hall be &s;aid, where the
will to do a certain unlawful act is accidentally follow|ed
by a mi&s;chief, which is of a quite different kind and de|gree?
In ca&s;es of this &s;ort, according to certain of the
Engli&s;h authorities, the guilt of the fir&s;t purpo&s;e is to be
con&s;idered, and the man to have judgment according to the
character in law of that which he intended to do: So that
if a per&s;on, &s;hooting at a bird, happen unfortunately to
kill his neighbour, his &s;entence &s;hall be different, according
to the kind of bird, and his purpo&s;e in &s;hooting<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Fo&s;ter, p. 258, 9. Keyling, 117.</NOTE>. If it be
<PB N="8" REF="65">
a tame fowl, which he &s;hot at for amu&s;ement only, or for
his improvement as a mark&s;man, it &s;hall be man&s;laughter,
becau&s;e of the unlawful purpo&s;e, of tre&s;pa&s;s on the property
of another. But if he &s;hot with intention to &s;teal and carry
off the fowl, which is a felony, it will be murder, by rea&s;on
of that intent: And again, if the homicide happen in &s;hoot|ing
at a wild pigeon, which is <HI>nullius in bonis,</HI> the per&s;on
&s;hall be entirely excu&s;ed. But I have found nothing in our
records, which inclines me to believe that our practice would
be di&s;po&s;ed to take up a &s;trained and artificial principle &s;uch
as this, by which things, in their own nature repugnant,
are conjoined, and the crime made out by coupling a pur|po&s;e
of lucre, to an act which is only then criminal, when it
comes of malice and a purpo&s;e to de&s;troy; a di&s;po&s;ition
which has neither actually been exerted, nor can rea&s;onably
be inferred again&s;t the pannel, as one who might probably
be capable of &s;uch wickedne&s;s, if the occa&s;ion &s;hould hap|pen.</P>
<P>If indeed the accident which en&s;ues is a near con&s;equence
and natural concomitant of the crime, which was meant
to be committed, this will alter the ca&s;e. As thus: If a
per&s;on goes out armed, to rob on the highway, and he
attacks a pa&s;&s;enger, who re&s;i&s;ts, and in the &s;truggle his pi&s;tol
di&s;charges, and the pa&s;&s;enger is killed, this, without a doubt,
is murder. For not only is &s;laughter a near and probable
re&s;ult of the purpo&s;e of violently robbing, (in &s;o much, that
if the party &s;hould fall in the &s;truggle, and break his neck,
even this might well be argued to be murder); but it hap|pens
in this in&s;tance, in con&s;equence of a preparation made
to kill; &s;o that there is here an original malice and mi&s;|chievous
purpo&s;e again&s;t the per&s;on, &s;uitable to the event,
<PB N="9" REF="66">
and whereof all the hazards mu&s;t be with him, who has
acted on &s;o atrocious a principle.</P>
<P>The like deci&s;ion may &s;eem to be right in another &s;itua|tion,
of which one in&s;tance was brought before the Court
of Ju&s;ticiary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 13. 1792. John Ker.</NOTE> though the pro&s;ecutor avoided to pre&s;s it to a
judgment; as indeed it is a ca&s;e of more difficulty than any
of tho&s;e which have yet been put. I allude to the ca&s;e of
a per&s;on who &s;ets fire to his own hou&s;e, being in&s;ured, and
inhabited by him&s;elf, meaning thereby to defraud the in|&s;urers;
if, in the progre&s;s of the flames, the hou&s;e of his
neighbour al&s;o is de&s;troyed. For though the main purpo&s;e
is a purpo&s;e of lucre to him&s;elf, yet neither can he in any
proper &s;en&s;e be &s;aid to be free of malice to his neighbour,
of who&s;e plain danger, from the conflagration thus kind|led,
he has &s;hewn his extreme di&s;regard. And indeed, if
the ca&s;e be put &s;omewhat more unfavourably for the pan|nel,
as upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that the two hou&s;es are un|der
one roof, or are floors of the &s;ame tenement, or are
otherwi&s;e &s;o connected in the way of building, that the one
mu&s;t be in very great ri&s;k by the burning of the other,
there &s;eems to be little doubt of the deci&s;ion which &s;hall be
given.</P>
<P>I will, by way of illu&s;tration, put another ca&s;e. If a mob
break into a hou&s;e, meaning to de&s;troy and pull it to pieces,
and in the bu&s;tle they accidentally &s;et fire to the hou&s;e,
which is con&s;umed, there &s;eems to be no good rea&s;on why
this may not be charged as fire-rai&s;ing. Becau&s;e the &s;ame
revengeful di&s;po&s;ition is exerted, and the &s;ame injurious ob|ject
is gained, in either mode of mi&s;chief; and thus the fir&s;t
purpo&s;e is ea&s;ily carried over to the event, without any &s;ort
of doubtful or unwarrantable inference again&s;t the pannels.
<PB N="10" REF="67">
But if a thief breaks into a warehou&s;e by night, to &s;teal, and
is &s;cared with noi&s;e, and ha&s;tily retires, leaving his light be|hind
him, and thus the warehou&s;e is burned, there is no
ground of inference from the motive of the thief, which
was for pure profit, without con&s;ideration of the per&s;on in|jured,
who or what he was, to that harmful and vindictive
purpo&s;e, which is e&s;&s;ential to the crime of fire-rai&s;ing. At
mo&s;t, therefore, the pannel, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, could only be
liable to an arbitrary pain, as having done his neighbour
this great harm, in pur&s;uance of an inchoated criminal act.
But I will not in&s;i&s;t any farther in this inquiry: E&s;peci|ally
as I have little aid therein from the &s;tate of practice,
which does not afford any adjudged ca&s;e towards elucida|tion
of the&s;e rare and difficult que&s;tions; &s;o that I have
only been &s;tating my own &s;entiments, concerning that which
&s;eems ju&s;t and rea&s;onable in it&s;elf.</P>
<P>THOUGH upon the&s;e articles there be great room for dif|ference
of opinion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Nature of Dole.</NOTE> yet the practice of all countries is agreed
with re&s;pect to certain others, which al&s;o concern the &s;tate
of the offender's con&s;cience. It is not material to the no|tion
of guilt, (and indeed if there were no other rea&s;on for
it, the impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;earching into the heart and &s;ecret
thoughts would be a &s;ufficient one,) that the offender have
him&s;elf had the full knowledge of the wrong and wicked|ne&s;s
of the thing he did. Though he were per&s;uaded that
it was innocent, or even meritorious, (as we know that by
fanatici&s;m both in politics and in religion, men of worth
and ability have been moved to commit the foule&s;t crimes,)
yet &s;till it will not &s;ave him from the judgment of the law,
which mu&s;t be determined by the nature of the act, and its
evil con&s;equences to the public, and not by any regard to
<PB N="11" REF="68">
tho&s;e mi&s;erable and &s;trange delu&s;ions, which are as danger|ous
as the vices of the mo&s;t open malefactor. What&s;oever
be the cau&s;e which impels a per&s;on to the doing of tho&s;e
things, which are de&s;tructive of the intere&s;t or the bonds
of &s;ociety, his will is not on that account the le&s;s vicious,
or his nature the le&s;s depraved. It is only the greater proof
of his depravity, that he could do the&s;e things, without
even feeling that they were wrong.</P>
<P>AS little is it included in the notion of dole, that the
offender have been in the knowledge of the puni&s;hment
which law annexes to his crime. Nay, though he even
thought that it was a lawful act, and liable to no puni&s;h|ment,
as in the ca&s;e of plundering a wrecked ve&s;&s;el, or
re&s;cuing his own goods &s;eized by the revenue-officers, &s;till he
&s;hall not have a defence in this belief; for he may, and is
bound to know, as much of the law as relates to the regulation
of his own conduct, and &s;hall be judged on the pre&s;umption
that he does &s;o. And thus it is, that certain ca&s;es of homi|cide
and other offences are explained, and reduced under the
common principle of dole, in which it may &s;eem, at fir&s;t
&s;ight, that the per&s;on is puni&s;hed for pure error, without a
criminal intention. The judge, for in&s;tance, who pronoun|ces
a &s;entence of death, which is obviou&s;ly unlawful, is not
adjudged guilty of murder becau&s;e he has erred, but on the
footing of his having wilfully done wrong. The law, which
cannot know the truth of his excu&s;e, and which perceives
the plain advantage that might be taken of &s;uch gro&s;s pre|tences,
for the indulgence of malice, pre&s;umes his know|ledge
of that which he is not excu&s;able for being ignorant
of, and will judge him accordingly. As applied to this mat|ter,
this &s;eems to be the true meaning of that maxim, &s;o of|ten
mentioned in the Roman law, <HI>culpa lata equiparatur dolo.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="69">
AFTER this of the nature of dole, or criminal intention,
we naturally pa&s;s to an enquiry concerning the per&s;ons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who may com|mit Crimes.</NOTE> who
are or are not capable of contracting this &s;ort of guilt. For
in truth, as Black&s;tone hath ob&s;erved, all the pleas and ex|cu&s;es
which &s;erve to protect any one from tho&s;e pains, which
law has otherwi&s;e appointed for his offence, may be re|duced
to the one con&s;ideration of the defect, either ab&s;o|lute
or in a certain degree, of that dole, that vicious will
or depraved di&s;po&s;ition, of which we have now been treat|ing.</P>
<P>I. WE &s;hall fir&s;t attend to the ca&s;e of minors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;e of Minors.</NOTE> or per&s;ons
under age, who are from that cau&s;e deficient in intelligence,
and in firmne&s;s al&s;o or maturity of will. As this is not,
however, equally true of all minors, but is various accord|ing
to the &s;everal degrees of non-age, and is even very dif|ferent
in per&s;ons of the &s;ame years, &s;o the law of mo&s;t coun|tries
has qualified its rules on this head, and made more than
one di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>HOW this matter was arranged for the &s;everal periods of

appears, that even upon a per&s;on under the age of fourteen,

might be inflicted, but lighter than in the ca&s;e of a
minor <HI>pubes.</HI> But in the law of the neighbouring kingdom,
the following, not unrea&s;onable rules, &s;eem to be received:
<PB N="13" REF="70">
1. With re&s;pect to per&s;ons either male or female, of four|teen
years of age, that capacity of dole is to be pre&s;umed,
and the ordinary judgment to be pronounced upon them,
though it be even judgment of death. 2. With re&s;pect to
tho&s;e who are under fourteen, and &s;till more decidedly with
re&s;pect to tho&s;e who are under twelve years of age, the pre|&s;umption
is the other way, but &s;till not to the exclu&s;ion of
evidence to the contrary; which, if it be obtained, and be
pregnant, and if, in&s;tead of delaying judgment, (that the
King's plea&s;ure concerning a pardon may be known), the
Court chu&s;es to proceed, it &s;hall be judgment for the ordi|nary
pains, what&s;oever the&s;e are, of the offence. 3. In the
ca&s;e of mere infants, or per&s;ons under &s;even years of age,
the pre&s;umption of freedom from dole is ab&s;olute, and does
not allow a conviction to be obtained<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hale, vol. i. p. 25. <HI>et &s;eq.</HI> Black&s;tone, vol. iv. p. 23, 24.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>TOUCHING our municipal practice;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Minors, if pu|ni&s;hable capital|ly in Scotland.</NOTE> I know not whether
it can be affirmed, that it has yet, in all the&s;e articles, at|tained
to the &s;ame degree of maturity and preci&s;ion as that
of England. This, however, &s;eems to be certain, that with
re&s;pect to minors, if they have reached the age of puberty,
which in this que&s;tion will be fixed at fourteen for females
as well as males, they are liable to the ordinary judgment,
not excepting that of death, for tho&s;e crimes, &s;uch as mur|der,
fire-rai&s;ing, theft, and the like, whereof the wickedne&s;s
may be known to them, even at that early period of life.</P>
<P>Mackenzie has indeed delivered his own opinion, that a
<HI>minor,</HI> (for he u&s;es no other term), &s;hall not in any ca&s;e be
liable to the ordinary pain, not even for crimes again&s;t the
law of nature, &s;uch as murder<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Tit. of Crimes, No. 5.</NOTE>: Nay, he even &s;eems to
<PB N="14" REF="71">
think it rea&s;onable, though he does not affirm this to be law,
that for any crime done in minority, the offender &s;hould not
be obliged to an&s;wer till he be major. But it is obvious,
that &s;o wide a &s;cheme of indulgence, which would exempt
that &s;ea&s;on of life when men are mo&s;t adventurous and in|ventive,
and mo&s;t liable al&s;o to the &s;eduction of evil ex|ample,
not only would not be &s;alutary, but in the end would
prove to be the rever&s;e of merciful or humane. And in
truth, though our records afford us many in&s;tances of &s;uch a
plea maintained for a minor pannel, and &s;ome of a lighter pu|ni&s;hment
inflicted on him, after advi&s;ing with the King or Pri|vy
Council<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Thus, on the 5th April 1636, on the conviction of John Macilconnell, a boy of fifteen, as pre&s;ent with the Macgrigors at their robberies and depredations, the Ju&s;tice, <HI>at the interce&s;&s;ion of the a&s;&s;ize,</HI> &s;uper&s;edes doom, until he advi&s;e with the Privy Council. According to a marking on the margin of the regi&s;ter, he &s;eems in the end to have been bani&s;hed.

the proper occa&s;ion came, the minor convict, equally as any

<P>IN later times,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Minors, if pu|ni&s;hable capital|ly.</NOTE> the &s;ame practice has without he&s;itation
been followed. Thus, on the 14th March 1786, Walter
Ro&s;s, for pocket-picking; on the 20th June 1786, John
John&s;ton for the &s;ame crime; and on the 14th February
1785, Archibald Stewart, for two acts of hou&s;e-breaking;
had all of them &s;entence of death, being lads of about
eighteen years old. Al&s;o, on the 23d June 1791, Stewart,
Paul and Bannatyne were condemned to die, for robbery;
one of whom was not above eighteen. For the like crime,
James Mackenzie, at the age of &s;eventeen, had &s;entence of
death at Gla&s;gow, on the 11th April 1793. But a much
&s;tronger example than any of the&s;e, and indeed &s;uch as
<PB N="17" REF="74">
makes it unnece&s;&s;ary to carry our re&s;eaches farther, is the
ca&s;e of Samuel Pirrie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ap. 20. &amp; 21. 1786.</NOTE> po&s;t-boy, tried at Ayr, for ab&s;tract|ing
a packet from the mail, containing the &s;um of L. 18,
which he conveyed to his mother-in-law, Jean Fitchie, who
appears to have &s;educed him to the crime. The verdict is
thus: &startq;Find the pannel Samuel Pirrie guilty of the theft
as libelled; but in re&s;pect of his tender age, being under,
or little above fourteen years, his apparent weakne&s;s of
under&s;tanding, his open and candid confe&s;&s;ion, and that
it appears by the evidence that he committed the crime
at the in&s;tigation, and for the benefit of his &s;tepmother,
Jean Fitchie; they beg leave humbly to recommend him
to the royal mercy.&endq; Yet even in the&s;e circum&s;tances,
which are an a&s;&s;emblage of all the con&s;iderations which in
any ca&s;e can &s;erve to extenuate guilt, did the Judge<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Then Lord Braxfield, now Lord Ju&s;tice-Clerk.</NOTE> think
it his duty to pronounce &s;entence of death upon the pannel,
leaving the interce&s;&s;ion of the jury to have its due influence
upon the royal brea&s;t, where it accordingly had the de&s;ired
effect, of procuring a pardon to this weak and mi&s;guided
youth.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect again to capital crimes of a &s;tatutory and
in&s;tituted nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How puni&s;hable for &s;tatutory Crimes.</NOTE> &s;uch as hearing of ma&s;s, &s;triking in pre|&s;ence
of the Court of Se&s;&s;ion, and the like, it may &s;eem
to be more doubtful, whether there be not room for a
di&s;tinction in favour of tho&s;e minors, who are nearer the
years of puberty than majority. And here an argument
may be grounded on the &s;tatute 1661, c. 20. concerning the
cur&s;ing and beating of parents, both in favour of &s;uch an
indulgence, as a rea&s;onable thing in it&s;elf, and for fixing on
the age of &s;ixteen years, as that at which the minor &s;hall
<PB N="18" REF="75">
become liable to death, for offences of this de&s;cription.
For &s;o it is appointed by that ordinance, with re&s;pect to the
tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions there vindicated, which, though known to
every child as high immoralities, and de&s;erving of the mo&s;t
&s;evere dome&s;tic correction, yet as objects of public trial,
and of &s;entence of death, are rather the creatures of the
law, and cannot ju&s;tly be imputed, to any one, who has not
attained to maturity of judgment and di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>IN regard to per&s;ons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pupils, if pu|ni&s;hable capital|ly.</NOTE> whether male or female, under the age
of fourteen years, whether they in any ca&s;e are liable to be
capitally puni&s;hed, I &s;hall rather content my&s;elf with &s;tating
&s;uch te&s;timonies as I have found in the record, which have
relation to this matter, than attempt to infer a rule from
&s;uch &s;canty and imperfect materials.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t October 1564, William Elliot of Hor&s;liehill,
and five others, are pannelled, for the murder of Scott of
Ha&s;&s;inden. One is repledged; four are convicted and be|headed;
and with re&s;pect to the &s;ixth pannel, Archibald
Elliot, who is marked <HI>puer</HI> on the margin of the record, op|po&s;ite
to his name, he is <HI>di&s;mi&s;&s;ed,</HI> without trial. On the 6th
of Augu&s;t 1605, William Maxwell, indicted along with his fa|ther
Archibald, for &s;laughter, and for &s;hooting with hagbuts,
is &s;ent to an a&s;&s;ize, notwith&s;tanding his plea of pupillarity.
The Ju&s;tice, however, at the &s;ame time, &startq;remits to the
a&s;&s;ize to take cognizance of his age, if they think expe|dient.&endq;
The a&s;&s;ize find him guilty &startq;of &s;hooting with hag|buts,
within a &s;pear's length of his father's hou&s;e, and
that he was then within fourteen years of age.&endq; It does
not appear that any &s;entence followed upon this conviction.</P>
<P>IN March 1701,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pupils, if pu|ni&s;hable capital|ly.</NOTE> Duff and Millar, the fir&s;t a boy of four|teen
years, the other about twelve, are indicted, along with
<PB N="19" REF="76">
Fra&s;er and Ander&s;on, two grown men, for breaking into the
Earl of Home's hou&s;e at Hir&s;el, and &s;tealing a quantity of
plate. The libel, as to the two boys, is found only rele|vant
to infer an arbitrary pain, and to infer death again&s;t
the other pannels. On conviction, Fra&s;er is condemned to
die,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 3. &amp; 10. 1701.</NOTE> and Duff and Millar to be &s;courged at the gibbet, at
the time of his execution, and Duff to &s;tand for an hour,
with an ear nailed to the gibbet, in pre&s;ence of Millar. The
next in date to this is the noted ca&s;e in 1749,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maclaurin's Ca|&s;es, No 55.</NOTE> of Alexander
Living&s;ton, a boy of twelve years old, and found by the
jury to be <HI>doli capax,</HI> and guilty of killing another boy, by
&s;tabbing him with a knife: and here the Court gave judg|ment
of tran&s;portation. La&s;t of all, John Brand, a boy of
thirteen years and eight months old, was brought to trial at
Perth, for &s;tealing letters from the po&s;t-office, which he had
accompli&s;hed by an ingenious device of his own contri|vance.
The Judges on the circuit thought the ca&s;e proper
for the con&s;ideration of all their brethren. But the boy peti|tioned
for bani&s;hment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 30. 1789.</NOTE> and the pro&s;ecutor thought it proper
to con&s;ent.</P>
<P>Such as the&s;e precedents are, they are all upon the &s;ide of
mercy. Yet I &s;hall not affirm that they are &s;uch, as to make
an ab&s;olute rule for all ca&s;es of crime committed in pupilla|rity,
without regard to the atrocious wickedne&s;s, the incor|rigible
ob&s;tinacy, or malicious cunning, of the offender, fully
revealed in that of which he is convicted. Put the ca&s;e
of repeated fire-rai&s;ing, or of the murder of a parent, or
of the murder of any per&s;on by poi&s;on, committed by
a boy of twelve or thirteen years of age: I he&s;itate to
&s;ay, for any authority I have &s;een, that the law will ex|tend
its mercy to the&s;e &s;ituations of extreme and hopele&s;s
depravity.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="77">
If, by any future judgment, it &s;hall be found that a pupil
has no ab&s;olute exemption from this la&s;t and highe&s;t atone|ment
for his crime, probably this di&s;cretion of the Court
will, however, at lea&s;t be &s;ubject to a limitation, with re&s;pect
to that period of life, between &s;even and ten and a half years,
and in the civil law termed <HI>infantiae proxima,</HI> which can
hardly be &s;uppo&s;ed to receive the full and capital degree of
dole. On the 13th November 1493, in a Court held at Lau|der,
Thomas Gothra&s;ton, a boy of eight years old, charged
with the murder of John Smith, is ordered to be &s;harply
&s;courged, &startq;<HI>ad effu&s;ionem &s;anguinis,</HI>&endq; on a holiday, at the
church of the pari&s;h of Legertwood, within which he had
done the deed<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Maclaurin, p. 747.</NOTE>. In the ca&s;e of Maxwell again&s;t Arm&s;trongs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 11. 1605.</NOTE>
for burning of corns, an objection is moved for certain of
the pannels, who allege that they were only eight years
of age at the time libelled. The re&s;ult &s;eems to be, that
they are pa&s;&s;ed from on finding caution to keep the peace<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">I &s;ay <HI>&s;eems</HI> to be, becau&s;e the record is confu&s;ed and difficult to be read.</NOTE>.
In like manner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 10. 1617.</NOTE> in the ca&s;e of William and James Hamilton,
which is a trial for theft, the pro&s;ecutor &startq;pa&s;&s;es &s;imply f$a
the pur&s;uite of James Hamilton, becau&s;e he is bot ane
young boy of ten year auld or thereby.&endq;</P>
<P>HITHERTO of the competency of inflicting death.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pupils, if pu|ni&s;hable arbitra|rily.</NOTE> In re|gard
to the le&s;&s;er pains, a more certain language may war|rantably
be u&s;ed. It is not by any authority maintained, that
a mere infant, one who is under &s;even years old, is in any
ca&s;e liable to any manner of pain. On the other &s;ide, it is
as little to be doubted, that for all crimes of &s;uch a kind,
whereof the wickedne&s;s can be &s;uppo&s;ed to be known to them,
<PB N="21" REF="78">
and committed in circum&s;tances of freedom, (for this &s;eems
to be a nece&s;&s;ary condition of the rule), all who are above
that age, and proved to be capable of dole, are liable to &s;uch
mitigated pains as &s;hall be adequate, in the opinion of the
Court, to the ends of correction and example. In evidence
of this, it may be &s;ufficient to refer to two in&s;tances, in ad|dition
to tho&s;e which have incidentally been mentioned.
One is the ca&s;e of Charles and Donald Robert&s;on, two boys
under fourteen<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">&startq;As to both the &s;ons, it is particularly pleaded, that they were not four|teen, and &s;o not puni&s;hable, and cannot pa&s;s to the knowledge of ane a&s;&s;ize.&endq; This is a pa&s;&s;age of Sir G. Mackenzie's pleading for them, as in the record. The printed pleading, in the edition of Sir George's works, makes them fifteen.</NOTE>, (as was alleged), indicted along with their
father,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 6, &amp; 9. 1671.</NOTE> for the ca&s;ting down of certain hou&s;es, at his com|mand,
and carrying off the materials to which he pretended
right. This charge was, upon full debate, found relevant
again&s;t them, and remitted to an a&s;&s;ize; but a conviction
was not obtained.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 27, &amp; 28. 1726.</NOTE> The other is the ca&s;e of Ludovick More,
Andrew Duncan and James Robert&s;on. The charge here
was for &s;hop breaking, and Robert&s;on pled, that at the date
of the fact, which was nearly a year before the trial, he
was a pupil and <HI>doli in capax,</HI> as would be evident to the
Court, <HI>ex habitu vultus et corporis.</HI> But of this plea no notice
was taken in the interlocutor; and being convicted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 3. 1726.</NOTE> he had
judgment of tran&s;portation along with the other pannels.</P>
<P>In like manner, upon libel for high crimes rai&s;ed again&s;t
either a minor or a pupil, and followed with petition on his
part for bani&s;hment or other arbitrary pain, it has always
been the practice that judgment pa&s;&s;es to that effect; nor
will the per&s;on be reponed again&s;t a &s;entence of this &s;ort,
under pretence of his minority, without proof of &s;ome gro&s;s
irregularity or &s;ub&s;tantial inju&s;tice in the proceedings. It
<PB N="22" REF="79">
has been mentioned, that John Brand, a boy under four|teen,
was bani&s;hed in this way. Andrew Maclaren, a boy
of &s;ixteen, charged with hou&s;e-breaking, had al&s;o been ba|ni&s;hed
Scotland in this form, by &s;entence of a Sheriff-court.
On 22d December 1783, he complained of this by &s;u&s;pen|&s;ion,
laid on the ground of his minority, the want of advice
on the occa&s;ion, and certain objections to the libel and way
of proceeding. But the Court of Ju&s;ticiary were of opinion,
that there was no ground of relief, and refu&s;ed the bill.</P>
<P>Before di&s;mi&s;&s;ing this article, I &s;hall only farther ob&s;erve,
that in fixing the mea&s;ure of puni&s;hment which &s;hall be in|flicted
on a pupil, the Court are not, cannot be confined to
di&s;pen&s;e it, according to years and days, but take into con|&s;ideration
all the circum&s;tances, the equity of the ca&s;e, and
proportion their &s;entence to the character of the particular
deed; &s;o as humanity may be con&s;ulted when&s;oever it can,
and the ends of public example be an&s;wered, when occa&s;ion
&s;hall require it. In this view, regard is not only to be had
to the rank of the crime in the ab&s;tract, but al&s;o to the con|trivance
and way of execution of the particular deed; to the
degree of concern which the pupil had in it, whether it was
as principal actor, or only in the way of remote and infe|rior
a&s;&s;i&s;tance; to the circum&s;tance of his doing it &s;ingle or
with accomplices; and if with a&s;&s;i&s;tance, whether it was
that of others of his own age, or of old and trained offen|ders,
or perhaps of &s;uch who &s;tood in a &s;ituation of awe and
authority over him, and might con&s;train him to the adven|ture
again&s;t his will.</P>
<P>II. NEXT,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nature of the Plea of In&s;anity.</NOTE> after minors, we may attend to the ca&s;e of tho&s;e
unfortunate per&s;ons, who have to plead the more mi&s;erable
defence of idiotry or madne&s;s, which, if it is not pretended,
<PB N="23" REF="80">
but genuine, and is withal of the due degree, and is fully
proved, brings the act to be the &s;ame as that of an infant,
and has equally the privilege in all ca&s;es of an entire ex|emption
from any manner of pain; &startq;<HI>Cum alterum inno|centia
concilii tuetur, alterum fati infelicitas excu&s;at</HI><NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">L. 12. ad Legem Corneliam de Sicariis.</NOTE>&endq;. I
&s;ay, where it is fully proved, and is of the due degree:
For if rea&s;on and humanity enforce the plea in the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances,
it is no le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve &s;uch a caution
and temperament in the application of it, as &s;hall hinder it
to be under&s;tood, that there is any privilege of mere weak|ne&s;s
of intellect, or of a &s;trange and moody humour, or of
a crazy and capricious, or irregular temper and habit.
None of the&s;e things either are or ought to be law. Becau&s;e
&s;uch con&s;titutions are neither exclu&s;ive of a competent un|der&s;tanding
of the true &s;tate of the circum&s;tances in which
the deed is done, nor of the &s;ub&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome &s;teady evil
pa&s;&s;ion, grounded in that &s;ituation, and directed to a certain
object. To &s;erve the purpo&s;e, therefore, of an excu&s;e in
law, the di&s;order mu&s;t amount to ab&s;olute alienation of rea|&s;on,
&startq;<HI>ut continua mentis alienatione, omni intellectu careat,</HI>&endq;
&s;uch a di&s;ea&s;e which deprives the patient of the know|ledge
of the true po&s;ition of things about him, and of the
di&s;cernment of friend from foe, and gives him up to the im|pul&s;e
of his own di&s;tempered fancy, dive&s;ted of all &s;elf-go|vernment,
or controul of his pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>WHETHER it &s;hould be added to the de&s;cription,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nature of the Plea of In&s;anity.</NOTE> that he
mu&s;t have lo&s;t all knowledge of good and evil, right and
wrong, this is a more delicate que&s;tion, and fit perhaps to
be re&s;olved differently, according to the &s;en&s;e in which it is
under&s;tood. If it be put in this &s;en&s;e, in a ca&s;e, for in|&s;tance,
<PB N="24" REF="81">
of murder, Did the pannel know that murder was a
crime? Would he have an&s;wered on the que&s;tion, that it
was wrong to kill a neighbour? this is hardly to be reputed
a ju&s;t criterion of &s;uch a &s;tate of &s;oundne&s;s, as ought to
make a man accountable in law for his actions. Becau&s;e it
may happen a per&s;on to an&s;wer in this way, who yet is &s;o
ab&s;olutely mad, as to have lo&s;t all true ob&s;ervation of facts,
all under&s;tanding of the good or evil intentions of tho&s;e
who are about him, or even the knowledge of their per&s;ons.
But if the que&s;tion be put in this other and more &s;pecial
&s;en&s;e, as relative to the very act done by the pannel, and
the particular &s;ituation in which at that time he conceived
him&s;elf to &s;tand, Did he, as at the moment of doing <HI>that
thing,</HI> under&s;tand the evil of it? Was he impre&s;&s;ed with the
con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt, and fear of puni&s;hment?&mdash;it is then
a pertinent and material que&s;tion, but which cannot to any
&s;ub&s;tantial purpo&s;e be an&s;wered, without taking into con&s;ide|ration
the whole circum&s;tances of the &s;ituation. Every judg|ment
in the matter of right and wrong &s;uppo&s;es a ca&s;e, or
&s;tate of facts, to which it applies. And though the pannel
have that ve&s;tige of rea&s;on, which may enable him to an|&s;wer
in the general, that murder is a crime, yet if he cannot
di&s;ti&s;tingui&s;h his friend from his enemy, but conceive eve|ry
thing about him to be the rever&s;e of what it really is,
and mi&s;take the illu&s;ions of his fancy for realities, with re|&s;pect
to his own condition, and that of others, &startq;<HI>ab&s;urda et
tri&s;tia &s;ibi dicens atque fingens,</HI>&endq; the&s;e remains of intellect
are thus of no u&s;e to him towards the government of his
actions, nor in anywi&s;e enable him to form a judgment up|on
any particular &s;ituation or conjuncture, of what is right
or wrong with regard to it. If he does not know the per|&s;on
of his friend or neighbour, or though he do know him,
<PB N="25" REF="82">
if he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the vain conceit that he is come there
to de&s;troy him, or that he has already done him the mo&s;t
cruel injuries, and that all about him are engaged in one
&s;oul con&s;piracy to abu&s;e him, as well might he be utterly
ignorant of the quality of murder. Proceeding, as it does,
on a fal&s;e ca&s;e, or conjuration of his own fancy, his judg|ment
of right and wrong, as to any re&s;pon&s;ibility that &s;hould
attend it, is truly the &s;ame as none at all. It is therefore
only in this complex and appropriated &s;en&s;e, as relative to the
particular thing done, and the &s;ituation of the pannel's feel|ings
and con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s on that occa&s;ion, that this inquiry
concerning his intelligence of moral good or evil is mate|rial,
and not in any other or larger &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT to return to the point whence I &s;et out.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;es of In&s;aui|ty.</NOTE> Our practice
has always been governed by the general precept, already
mentioned, which admits of no defence, &s;hort of ab&s;olute
alienation of rea&s;on. To that purpo&s;e, the interlocutor up|on
the ca&s;e of Robert Thom&s;on, indicted for murder,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 18. 1739.</NOTE> finds it
relevant, and allows him to prove, &startq;That when the fact
libelled was committed, he was &s;o furious, mad and di|&s;tracted,
<HI>as to be totally deprived of his rea&s;on and under|&s;tanding;</HI>
re&s;erving con&s;ideration as to the effect of what
&s;hould be found proven, until the verdict &s;hould be re|turned.&endq;</P>
<P>THE &s;ame principle had governed in the conviction of
Thomas Gray. This man was indicted for murder,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 26, 27. 1773.</NOTE> by &s;tab|bing.
It was alleged for him, that he was of very weak
intellect, extremely pa&s;&s;ionate and flighty, addicted to the
immoderate drinking of &s;trong liquors, and, on the whole,
what between the u&s;e of the&s;e and natural infirmity, rather
a &s;ort of fool or crazy per&s;on, and &s;o con&s;idered by his
<PB N="26" REF="83">
neighbours, than a &s;ound man. This account was confirmed
by the witne&s;&s;es upon the trial, &s;everal of whom &s;wore to his
being drunk when he &s;tabbed, and that he was at all times
a weak and pa&s;&s;ionate creature, and e&s;pecially (as they ex|pre&s;&s;ed
it) &startq;on the woodi&s;h order when he got drunk.&endq; All
this was plainly &s;hort of madne&s;s in the &s;en&s;e of law, and
the jury therefore found him <HI>guilty</HI> of the murder<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">It was pleaded for this man, at recording the verdict, that he was <HI>then</HI> in|&s;ane, and that &s;entence could not pa&s;s upon him. The diet was continued; and the ca&s;e appears to have dropped out of the record.</NOTE>. The rule is farther confirmed by the ca&s;e of Robert Bonthorn.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 29. and Dec. 12. 1763.</NOTE>
The charge again&s;t him was, that being a &s;muggler, and ha|ving
had contraband goods &s;eized in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, he, out
of revenge, laid hold of an opportunity violently to pu&s;h the
revenue-officer over a precipice upon the &s;ea-&s;hore, whereby
the man had his thigh-bone broken, and was otherwi&s;e in|jured.
The jury &startq;find the libel proven, and al&s;o find, that
the intellects of the pannel are mo&s;t remarkably weak,
irregular and confu&s;ed, and therefore recommend him to
the mercy of the Court.&endq; He had judgment, neverthe|le&s;s,
to be twice whipped at different places of the county
where he dwelt, and for a &s;um of damages and expences.</P>
<P>FOR the &s;ame rea&s;ons which weighed in the&s;e ca&s;es, the
defence of madne&s;s is le&s;s &s;u&s;pected, and will more ea&s;ily
be received, again&s;t a charge of murder, mutilation, or other
violent crime, than of tho&s;e offences, like theft or forgery,
which can hardly be executed without art and &s;teadine&s;s of
purpo&s;e.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 22. and Mar. 9. 1731.</NOTE> I find that in the trial of Thomas Hender&s;on, for
hor&s;e-&s;tealing, it was pleaded for him, that he was &s;ubject to
occa&s;ional fits of madne&s;s. But the libel charged, that he
had conducted him&s;elf prudently in the adventure, having
&s;tolen the hor&s;e in the night, and ridden &s;traightway by an
<PB N="27" REF="84">
unfrequented road to a di&s;tance, where he left the hor&s;e,
under a plau&s;ible pretence, and, la&s;t of all, &s;old it, and took
a bill for the price. The interlocutor therefore did not take
notice of this allegation, but repelled in general all the
pannel's defences.</P>
<P>BUT although the di&s;temper mu&s;t thus be ab&s;olute in de|gree,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mu&s;t the In&s;ani|ty be con&s;tant.</NOTE>
it is not material that it be al&s;o total in re&s;pect of
time. The quality of the action has no dependence but
upon the pannel's &s;tate of mind at the time of doing it; &s;o
that whether his malady be con&s;tant and unremitting, or
only return at intervals, &s;till the defence will be equally
available, if he was then utterly furious, and void of rea&s;on.
And here I may cite the ca&s;e of Sir Archibald Kinloch,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 29. 1795.</NOTE>
which was that of a per&s;on, who, having had his &s;en&s;es in|jured
by the acute delirium of a We&s;t India fever, was
afterwards liable to occa&s;ional fits of derangement, though
at con&s;iderable intervals, and at length, in a &s;tate of utter
furio&s;ity, had the misfortune to kill his brother. The vio|lence
of this fit had only been for a few days before the
fact, and he &s;oon after &s;ettled into his ordinary condition.
Neverthele&s;s, the jury were unanimous to acquit him.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;e of Robert Spence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;es of In&s;ani|ty at Intervals.</NOTE> al&s;o tried for murder, was in
&s;ome mea&s;ure of the &s;ame de&s;cription. The pannel, and the
decea&s;ed, who was a woman,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 19. &amp; 30. 1747.</NOTE> and teacher of a &s;chool, were
inhabitants of different floors in the &s;ame building. And
it apears, that having ri&s;en in his &s;hirt, in the du&s;k of the
evening, and knocked at her door, he, upon opening, in&s;tant|ly
ru&s;hed in, and uttering &s;ome &s;trange and incoherent ex|clamations
again&s;t the woman, knocked her on the head
<PB N="28" REF="85">
with a hatchet, or chopping knife, which he brought with
him. After di&s;patching her, he ran off to his own hou&s;e, and
when a <HI>po&s;&s;e</HI> a&s;&s;embled to &s;eize him, he &s;uddenly &s;prung out
upon them, and attempted to e&s;cape. It was al&s;o a remark|able
circum&s;tance, that on returning to his hou&s;e, he had
taken offence at a wig-block which &s;tood there, and violently
clove it down with the &s;ame hatchet; &s;o that it was found
all be&s;meared with the woman's brains and gore. With re|gard
to his &s;ymptoms of di&s;order for &s;ome days preceding,
they were chiefly the&s;e; a great degree of re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, a
di&s;po&s;ition to ramble through the country at all hours and
without an object, incoherent di&s;cour&s;e, and di&s;orderly be|haviour,
though without any act of outrage or violence of|fered
to his neighbour. But it was farther proved, that
&s;ome years before, when employed as a &s;ailor, he had oc|ca&s;ionally
&s;hown &s;ymptoms of derangement, which were
aggravated by drinking, &s;o that he had &s;ometimes been con|&s;ined
on board of &s;hip, for eight or ten &s;ucce&s;&s;ive days, as
in&s;ane. The jury found it &startq;proven, that the pannel was
furious at the time he committed the &s;aid murder, but
to what degree of furio&s;ity, they could not determine.&endq;
On which verdict, the Court ordered him into confinement,
until bail &s;hould be found by his relations, to keep him in
a &s;tate of &s;afety.</P>
<P>THERE is one ca&s;e more of the &s;ame character upon re|cord;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 14. 1781.</NOTE>
that of Jean Blair, who, with a hatchet, cruelly
mangled and killed her mi&s;tre&s;s, with whom &s;he had li|ved
&s;ome years, as a confidential &s;ervant, and then, after
&s;etting fire to the hou&s;e, and defacing the effects with|in
it, ran out &s;tark naked, and with her hands bloody, into
the &s;treet, and gave the alarm of fire to the guard. It was
proved that &s;everal of her family had been in&s;ane, and that
<PB N="29" REF="86">
&s;he her&s;elf had &s;hewn &s;ymptoms of in&s;anity about ten years
before. She was acquitted of the murder; but was ordered
into confinement.</P>
<P>I AM not &s;ure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;es of In&s;anity at Intervals.</NOTE> whether I ought to refer to the &s;ame, or
to another cla&s;s, the ca&s;e, already mentioned, of Robert
Thom&s;on, which was tried in June 1739. It was, in all its
circum&s;tances, an extraordinary ca&s;e. The pannel was ac|cu&s;ed
of the murder of George Forre&s;ter, committed at mid|day,
in the muir of Ballencrieff, and on the highway from
Haddington to Aberlady, by knocking him down from his
hor&s;e with a &s;tone, and cutting his throat with a pen-knife,
as he lay on the ground. The pannel was a black&s;mith,
and had been employed in his trade as u&s;ual, that very
morning, till ten o'clock. And farther, not more than half
an hour before the murder, two per&s;ons, who met him on
the highway, had &s;poken to him in pa&s;&s;ing, and without
ob&s;erving any thing unu&s;ual in his appearance. A few hours
after committing the murder, he was taken into cu&s;tody,
and in the afternoon of the &s;ame day, and in the cour&s;e of
conveyance to goal, he had &s;o far recovered as to be &s;en|&s;ible
of what he had done. He pointed out the preci&s;e &s;pot
where he had killed the decea&s;ed; &s;howed &startq;the inno|cent
blood&endq; (as he called it) on the ground; &s;aid, that
his own blood would be &s;hed for it; and expre&s;&s;ed con|cern
on account of the di&s;tre&s;s which he would bring upon
his father. He al&s;o related to the per&s;ons who had charge
of him upon the way, that the decea&s;ed had many times
cried for mercy, while he was &s;triking him on the ground;
but, &startq;I trow (&s;aid he) I had no mercy on him, for I be|lieved
it was the devil that I killed.&endq; In the &s;ame &s;train
he added, that before meeting the decea&s;ed, he had cha&s;ed
<PB N="30" REF="87">
the devil through the muir in another &s;hape, &startq;like a man
with a whin-cow in his hat,&endq; and who &s;uddenly vani&s;hed
from before him in the pur&s;uit. In confirmation of the&s;e
&s;trange circum&s;tances, it was proved, that the pannel was
&s;ubject to convul&s;ion fits, e&s;pecially at full moon, and that
he was melancholy after them, and liable to be troubled
with religious horrors, &s;o that he &s;ometimes &s;tarted from his
bed in the night, and &s;poke and acted as if he were grap|pling
with the devil. He had been &s;eized with one of
the&s;e fits a few days before the murder, but it had not
been followed with any extraordinary depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits.
The jury returned a verdict finding &startq;no proof of furio&s;ity
&startq;till after the murder was committed;&endq; as indeed no one
was pre&s;ent to judge of his appearance at that time, and re|cently
before he had been in his ordinary condition. Yet
upon the whole circum&s;tances there was little room to be|lieve
him guilty; and in this light the ca&s;e had been viewed
el&s;ewhere; for he received a tran&s;portation-pardon.</P>
<P>WHAT is &s;till more &s;trange than any malady of this kind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;es of &s;udden Phren&s;y.</NOTE>
there have even been in&s;tances of &s;udden, and in a great
mea&s;ure unaccountable phren&s;y, and which, though exce&s;&s;ive
for the time, quickly &s;ub&s;ided, and never again returned.
And in the&s;e too, the plea of in&s;anity has been &s;u&s;tained.
A hi&s;tory of this &s;ort is related by Sir M. Hale; that of a
woman who was tried at Ayle&s;bury in 1668, for the murder
of her own child. She was a married woman, and of un|doubted
good fame and virtuous deportment. But not ha|ving
&s;lept for &s;ome nights after her delivery, and by this and
other di&s;order of her per&s;on, having fallen into a &s;ort of deli|rium,
and being left alone, &s;he killed her infant; which,
pre&s;ently after, &s;he &s;howed to &s;ome per&s;ons who came in,
<PB N="31" REF="88">
and told them &s;he had done it. She was in&s;tantly carried
to goal, where, in a little, &s;he fell into a deep &s;leep, and on
awaking, was found to have recovered her &s;en&s;es, and mar|velled
much, how, or on what account &s;he had come there.
The jury very ju&s;tly found her not guilty of the murder.<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hale, vol. i. p. 36.</NOTE></P>
<P>VERY like this, though the verdict was different, was our
ca&s;e of Agnes Crockat, of the 23d July 1756. This woman
al&s;o had killed her own child. She was an unmarried wo|man,
but had called help to her delivery, and had openly
kept and &s;uckled the child for the &s;pace of &s;ix or &s;even days.
It was &s;worn to, that at times, upon the day of the fact,
&s;he had been &s;trange in her &s;peech and behaviour, but to
which the witne&s;&s;es had not paid much regard; and being
left alone with her child, &s;he laid hand upon and &s;trangled
it. She kept it, however, lying openly by her in the bed,
till the people of the hou&s;e returned, and then &s;he &s;howed
it them, and told them what &s;he had done, and &s;aid, &startq;that
the devil had tempted her.&endq; The ca&s;e was thus far weak|er
than the former, that there was no clear proof of bodi|ly
complaint, or of a marked tran&s;ition from a &s;tate of di&s;|order
to &s;oundne&s;s. The jury therefore found her guilty.
But the royal mercy interpo&s;ed to prevent her execution.</P>
<P>A THIRD ca&s;e of the like character,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;es of &s;udden Phren&s;y.</NOTE> was tried at Jedburgh,
in April 1785, and i&s;&s;ued in a verdict of acquittal. The
pannel was a man named Robert Coal&s;ton, a hu&s;bandman or
farm-&s;ervant. Some years before the fact, he had been
&s;truck with lightening, and from that time had occa&s;ionally
been &s;ubject to melancholy and depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits, but not
in any remarkable degree, nor &s;uch as hindered him to do
his bu&s;ine&s;s as a &s;ervant, and without any &s;ort of tendency
<PB N="32" REF="89">
to violence or mi&s;chief. But of a &s;udden, and without any
new or vi&s;ible cau&s;e, the man became re&s;tle&s;s and impatient,
and having left his ma&s;ter's hou&s;e, in the middle of the
night, &s;et a roaming through the country, without plan or
object, and behaving ab&s;urdly, as he went along, but &s;till
without offering violence to any whom he met. In the e|vening
of the next day, he returned to his ma&s;ter's hou&s;e;
and by this time, having waxed outrageous, he abu&s;ed his
fellow-&s;ervants; a&s;&s;aulted and &s;truck his mi&s;tre&s;s; and ha|ving
&s;uddenly &s;natched an infant out of her arms, which
&s;he had upon the brea&s;t, he ran off with it, out of the
hou&s;e. A few minutes after, the child and he were found to|gether
in an outhou&s;e, the child dead, and da&s;hed to pieces,
and the man &s;itting quietly by it, as quite uncon&s;cious of
what had pa&s;&s;ed. He made no attempt to fly or re&s;i&s;t, and was
carried to goal, where he &s;oon &s;ettled into a &s;tate of lan|guor
and &s;tupefaction; out of which when he recovered,
in the cour&s;e of a few days, he &s;eemed to have no remem|brance
of the&s;e incidents, and &s;uffered great agitation, on
being told what he had done<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The&s;e circum&s;tances do not appear on the record; but are known to me, as coun&s;el for the pannel.</NOTE>. The jury found the &s;laugh|ter
proved, but the in&s;anity al&s;o proved; and he was or|dered
into confinement. In &s;hort, how unaccountable &s;oever
to us, the&s;e vi&s;itations of &s;udden and temporary madne&s;s,
yet &s;till they are within the compa&s;s of this mi&s;erable privi|lege,

<P>BESIDE tho&s;e, of which an account has incidentally been
given, I have found but one in&s;tance more of the plea
of furio&s;ity &s;u&s;tained, in which there is any thing worthy
to be remarked; the ca&s;e of James Sommerville, tried in
<PB N="33" REF="90">
1704. This man was one of the town-officers of Edin|burgh,
and had &s;hot a &s;oldier of the town-guard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 20, &amp; 27. Dec. 5. &amp; 8.</NOTE> one of a
party which had been &s;ent to &s;eize him, on his becoming
outrageous. The&s;e were the chief circum&s;tances alleged
in evidence of his in&s;anity: 1. That three or four months
before the deed, the magi&s;trates of the city, having ob&s;er|ved
indications of derangement, had ordered him to keep
at home, and appointed him a weekly allowance during his
confinement. 2. He had conceived a jealou&s;y of evil in|tended
him, and had applied to the Provo&s;t for a &s;afe con|duct
or protection, which was given him, out of indulgence
to his humour. 3. About four months before the &s;laughter,
he had called for a &s;word to kill his brother, who came to
vi&s;it him. 4. He became &s;lovenly in his per&s;on and appa|rel,
in&s;tead of careful as formerly, and walked out into the
&s;treet with his &s;tockings loo&s;e about his heels. 5. He ut|tered
&s;trange and hideous cries in church, and in time of di|vine
&s;ervice. 6. On the morning of the day libelled, he
ran into the &s;treet in his &s;hirt, with a drawn &s;word, and
threatened his neighbours. 7. On being committed after
the fact, and de&s;ired to give up his officer's coat or uniform,
he was &s;currilous to the magi&s;trate, and de&s;ired him &startq;to go
hang him&s;elf and his coat.&endq; 8. After commitment, he was
&s;o di&s;orderly, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to confine him in the

<P>IN regard to the proof of furio&s;ity: It is not di&s;puted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pre&s;umptions in ca&s;es of In&s;anity.</NOTE> that
in the ca&s;e of one who has always been reputed &s;ane, it lies
with the pannel fully to e&s;tabli&s;h this, equally as any other,
defence. But as to the ca&s;e of lunacy or periodical mad|ne&s;s,
a controver&s;y is agitated in the law books touching the
pre&s;umption on the &s;ubject, whether it &s;hall be that the deed
was done in furio&s;ity, or in a lucid interval<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">See Mathaeus, <HI>tit. Qui Crim. adm. Po&s;&s;.</HI> No. 6.</NOTE>. One thing is
obvious on this head, that there is no room for pre&s;umptions,
unle&s;s in the ca&s;e, which cannot be a frequent one, that the
jury cannot come to a conclu&s;ion either way, upon the proof
of the pannel's &s;ituation of mind, as at the time when the
deed was done. For if there be a proof applicable to that
period, and if it either e&s;tabli&s;h no &s;ymptoms of di&s;order,
or but very &s;light ones, it will not defend the pannel that
<PB N="35" REF="92">
he had formerly, (as was the ca&s;e of Lord Ferrers), and for
a length of time been in&s;ane. Now as to &s;ituations of a
doubtful character, I can imagine but one, in which it may
be rea&s;onable to pre&s;ume for the influence of di&s;ea&s;e upon
the act. I mean the &s;ituation of a per&s;on, who ordinarily,
and for a cour&s;e of years has been in&s;ane, with but few, and
&s;hort, and imperfect intervals of rea&s;on; and more e&s;pecially
this will be ju&s;t, if he is found with the plain &s;ymptoms of
furio&s;ity upon him recently after doing the deed. One, for
in&s;tance, who for years has been confined in a mad-hou&s;e,
if, taking advantage of the occa&s;ional liberty which is in|dulged
him, on the faith of any &s;eeming intermi&s;&s;ion of his
fury, he &s;hall make his e&s;cape from his friends, to who&s;e &s;o|ciety
he has been re&s;tored, and &s;hall kill a per&s;on when no
one is by to bear te&s;timony to what pa&s;&s;es, and &s;hall after|wards,
in the cour&s;e of the &s;ame day, be taken in a &s;tate of
ab&s;olute di&s;traction; he may &s;eem to be within the privi|lege
of this humane con&s;truction. In the ca&s;e, on the con|trary,
of one who&s;e lucid intervals have been longer and
more frequent, the pre&s;umption upon a doubtful and defec|tive
proof &s;hall be again&s;t him; though by rea&s;on of the
faulty habit, and the natural &s;u&s;picion of the lurking vice,
where it has once &s;hown it&s;elf, weaker evidence may
here be admitted to ca&s;t the balance, than in the trial of
one who has never been &s;ubject to this affliction. The &s;itua|tion
is &s;till more unfavourable to the pannel, if his ordinary
condition be that of a &s;ound man, or if his lucid intervals
have generally been at &s;tated periods, and of nearly the
&s;ame endurance, and the deed is done within the regu|lar
period of &s;uch an interval. But truly it is a vain at|tempt
to compre&s;s within a few &s;hort maxims, all the po&s;&s;ible
varieties and combinations of the&s;e mi&s;erable di&s;orders. And
<PB N="36" REF="93">
on the whole, it will be much &s;afer to conclude, that if
ever &s;o ambiguous a ca&s;e &s;hall happen, the que&s;tion will ra|ther
be fit for the con&s;ideration of the jury, on the whole
hi&s;tory and circum&s;tances of the particular malady, as de|tailed
in evidence to them, than for the re&s;olution of the
Court, as matter of law, by any general rule.</P>
<P>WITH regard to the re&s;ult of a verdict,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Judgment in Ca|&s;es of In&s;anity.</NOTE> finding the de|fence
of furio&s;ity proved, it cannot well be any other, than
the entire acquittal of the pannel, &startq;<HI>cum &s;atis furore ip&s;o
puniatur</HI>&endq;<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Lex 14. tit. 18. lib. 1. Dig.</NOTE>. And this, according to the remark of Sir
Mathew Hale, mu&s;t equally hold true, of whichever kind
the madne&s;s be; whether it be attended with rage, fury,
and tempe&s;tuous violence, or is only &s;uch as takes away the
u&s;e of rea&s;on and memory, and leaves the per&s;on in a &s;tate
of imbecillity and &s;tupor; in which, if, as a machine, he
do any evil, though without <HI>impetus</HI> or rage, it is not a pro|per
act of his, for which he can be accountable in law. As
to the inferior degrees of derangement, or natural weak|ne&s;s
of intellect, which do not amount to madne&s;s, and
for which there can be no rule in law; the relief of the&s;e
mu&s;t be &s;ought either in the di&s;cretion of the pro&s;ecu|tor,
who may re&s;trict his libel to an arbitrary pain, or in
the cour&s;e of application to the King for mercy. Yet I
find,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 8. 1704.</NOTE> that in one ca&s;e, that of Sommerville, though perhaps
not to be approved of as a precedent, a middle cour&s;e was
taken, by ab&s;olving the pannel from all corporal pain, but
decreeing for a fine to the fi&s;cal, and a&s;ythment to the wi|dow
and children of the decea&s;ed.</P>
<P>ONE matter, however, there is, for which, by ju&s;t and
uniform cu&s;tom, the Court take order by their &s;entence,
<PB N="37" REF="94">
except in tho&s;e rarer ca&s;es of delirium from fever, or other
bodily di&s;ea&s;e, for which an undoubted momentary cau&s;e
can be a&s;&s;igned. I mean the providing of &s;ecurity to the
public, and to the pannel him&s;elf, again&s;t the danger of his
malady, if unhappily he &s;hall again be afflicted with it. To
this end, in the ca&s;e of Sommerville, the Court appointed him
to be confined in the hou&s;e of correction, &startq;never to be libe|rated
therefrom, but upon a certificate under the hands of
the magi&s;trates, and two known phy&s;icians, that he has
convale&s;ced, and become &s;ound in his judgment.&endq; But
more ordinarily, the cour&s;e has been to qualify the order of
confinement, by a humane provi&s;ion, allowing the magi&s;trate
or keeper of the goal to deliver over the pannel to &s;uch re|lation,
or other per&s;on, who &s;hall find &s;ufficient bail in the
books of adjournal, to the &s;atisfaction of the Court, and un|der
&s;uch penalty as they &s;hall appoint, to keep and detain
him in &s;afe cu&s;tody for the future. Deliverance was given
to that effect, in the ca&s;e of Robert Spence in 1747, of Jean
Blair in 1781, of Robert Coal&s;ton in 1785, and of Gordon
Kinloch in 1795; in which la&s;t ca&s;e, the penalty of the
bail-bond was Ten thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>III. I HAVE now &s;aid &s;ufficient concerning the defences of
nonage and in&s;anity;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Defence of Intoxication.</NOTE> and the&s;e are properly the only ca&s;es
of incapacity of crime, that attaches to, and is inherent in,
the per&s;on. But I &s;hall &s;ubjoin &s;ome ob&s;ervations upon cer|tain
other &s;ituations, where a per&s;on altogether &s;ane, and of
the years of di&s;cretion, and therefore capable of committing
crimes, may however be alleged to have a privilege, by rea|&s;on
of the particular circum&s;tances which he is in at the
time of doing the deed. And fir&s;t, I &s;hall &s;ay a word or
two concerning that &s;ort of temporary madne&s;s, which is
<PB N="38" REF="95">
produced by exce&s;s in intoxicating liquors. It has been
alleged, on the authority of a &s;ingle text, that for this &s;ort
of frailty the Roman law had &s;uch indulgence, as in every
ca&s;e to remit the capital pain <HI>per vinum aut la&s;civiam lap&s;is</HI><NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Lib. 6. Dig. de Re Militari, No. 7.</NOTE>.
But it is plain, as well from the title of the chapter in the
Dige&s;t, where this pa&s;&s;age &s;tands, as from the whole &s;cope
and connection of the law, of which it is a part, that this was
no general precept of that &s;y&s;tem, but a &s;pecial ordinance,
relative to the ca&s;e of a &s;oldier, who wounded him&s;elf, or
attempted his own life. Some have thought, that even
among &s;oldiers, it concerned him only, who, having &s;lipped
and fallen when in liquor, in this way accidentally gave him|&s;elf
a wound<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Voet. Comment. in lib. 47. tit. 10. Dig. No. 1.</NOTE>. But however this may be, certain it is, that
the law of Scotland regards this wilful madne&s;s with a quite
different di&s;po&s;ition from the other, which is the vi&s;itation
of Providence, and if it does not con&s;ider the intemperance
as an aggravation in the ca&s;e, at lea&s;t &s;ees very good rea&s;on
why it &s;hould not be admitted as an excu&s;e for the offender,
to &s;ave him from the ordinary pains of his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.
For, not to mention that a per&s;on cannot well lay claim to
favour, upon the ground of that which it&s;elf &s;hews a blame|able
di&s;regard of decency and order, How are the differ|ent
degrees of ebriety to be &s;ettled, or the real ebriety to
be di&s;tingui&s;hed from that which is affected; or what protec|tion
&s;hall there be on this plan again&s;t the attempts of &s;uch
who may inflame them&s;elves with liquor, for the purpo&s;e of
gaining courage to indulge their pa&s;&s;ions, and an opportunity
to do it &s;afely? Be&s;ides, if there were even no danger of &s;uch
contrivances, a &s;ecurity is indi&s;pen&s;ible to be provided to
<PB N="39" REF="96">
the peaceable and decent part of the community, who would
otherwi&s;e be delivered into the di&s;cretion of the di&s;&s;olute
and worthle&s;s. For the&s;e &s;ub&s;tantial rea&s;ons, our cu&s;tom
utterly di&s;owns this defence, and this generally, and with|out
regard to that di&s;tinction, which has often been urged,
but is not &s;uited to practice, &startq;<HI>inter ebrios et ebrio&s;os,&endq;</HI> be|tween
&s;uch as are habitual drunkards, or are only accident|ally
in liquor. This was pled and repelled, in the ca&s;e of Jo|&s;eph
Hume, in February 1732, which was a ca&s;e of murder.
Likewi&s;e in the ca&s;e of Maclauchlan, in March 1737, for
murder and riot, the general plea was argued and repelled;
as it had long ago been in another ca&s;e of murder, that of
Hamilton of Green,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July, Augu&s;t 1716.</NOTE> and in many prior ca&s;es.</P>
<P>BUT although this be a ju&s;t and &s;alutary rule, in its appli|cation
to crimes, &s;uch as tho&s;e that have been mentioned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Defence of Intoxication.</NOTE>
yet it &s;eems to be que&s;tionable, though I have not ob&s;erved
that any author makes the di&s;tinction, whether the &s;ame
holds equally true of all offences without exception. There
are &s;everal offences of that nature, which neither are &s;o
tempting to the delinquent by any profit that is attached to
them, nor are attended with any <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> or immediate da|mage
to a neighbour or to &s;ociety, and which indeed are
chiefly reputed criminal on account of the violation of or|der
and decency, and the <HI>po&s;&s;ible</HI> evil influence on the
minds of &s;uch who come to the knowledge of them. Of
this de&s;cription are bla&s;phemy, here&s;y, lea&s;ing-making, the
uttering of &s;editious words, and &s;ome others, which are
chiefly puni&s;hed, as an in&s;ult to the order of the &s;tate, or
as tending to le&s;&s;en the re&s;pect of the hearers for the Prince,
or their veneration for the truths of religion. Now, in any
of the&s;e points of view, not only is the wickedne&s;s of the
tran&s;gre&s;&s;or le&s;&s;ened in our opinion, if he was not in the
<PB N="40" REF="97">
due po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his faculties at the time, but the injury it|&s;elf
to the community, the po&s;&s;ible harm and contagion
of his example, is prevented; whereas, in a ca&s;e of fire-rai&s;ing,
robbery, murder, or the like, the mi&s;chief is always
the &s;ame, what&s;oever, in that re&s;pect, have been the condi|tion
of the actor. But if a per&s;on go to hear ma&s;s in liquor,
who is a good prote&s;tant when he is &s;ober, or if an orthodox
and pious citizen &s;hall be prophane, or heretical, or bla&s;|phemous,
in his liquor, or if a loyal and well affected &s;ub|ject
in the &s;ame condition &s;hall forget his principles, and
utter calumnies again&s;t the King; in any of the&s;e ca&s;es, who
is there that heeds or regards him? His example does not
&s;educe, his doctrines do not lay hold or any man's mind,
becau&s;e they are not &s;eriou&s;ly taught, nor can be &s;aid to be
truly his: The words are not even in the hearing &s;o offen|&s;ive
to the ears of the by&s;tanders, as in the mouth of one
who advi&s;edly utters them; nor can the State or Church rea|&s;onably
feel the &s;ame re&s;entment of them, as of a malicious
and deliberate in&s;ult. Many other &s;ituations may be imagi|ned,
in which there &s;eem to be the like rea&s;ons for mitiga|tion
of the ordinary pains; I &s;ay for mitigation, for I would
not be under&s;tood to argue for entire impunity, nor even
for mitigation, unle&s;s it appear on the whole circum&s;tances
of the ca&s;e, that the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion is fairly imputable to the
condition of the man at the time. But in this I have only
been delivering my own &s;entiment, which is not &s;upported
with any precedent, nay, has even to &s;truggle with an ex|pre&s;s
judgment to the contrary, and given too in a ca&s;e
which was favourable to the pannel. In 1697, Patrick
Kinninmount was tried for bla&s;phemy by railing again&s;t
God, upon a libel which concluded for the pains of death.
Among other defences, it was pleaded for him, that if he
<PB N="41" REF="98">
ever uttered &s;uch words, it was in a &s;tate of fury or di&s;trac|tion,
occa&s;ioned by exce&s;s in liquor.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 13. 1697.</NOTE> The Court &startq;finds the
defence that the pannel was furious or di&s;tracted in his
wits relevant, in the terms of the act of Parliament, but
repels the allegeance of fury or di&s;traction ari&s;ing from
drunkenne&s;s, and al&s;o repels the haill other defences.&endq;
Yet it may be ob&s;erved, with re&s;pect to the offences provided
for in the &s;tatute 6th Anne, c. 7. that it is only by the mali|cious
and advi&s;ed a&s;&s;ertion of the pretender's title, and the
advi&s;ed denial of the right of Parliament to limit the de|&s;cent
of the Crown by laws, that the pains of <HI>praemunire</HI> are
incurred; which is thus far an adoption of the principle
I have &s;ugge&s;ted, and in the &s;ort of ca&s;e to which I have
applied it.</P>
<P>IV. LET us next con&s;ider the effect in law of that more
favourable &s;ort of con&s;traint upon the will,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Plea of Subjection.</NOTE> which is not of
the offender's own producing, but ari&s;es from the &s;tate of
&s;ubjection in which he is with re&s;pect to others, by who&s;e
command he does the evil deed, knowing it to be wrong,
and contrary to what his own free will would determine.</P>
<P>1. AND fir&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">As between Wife and Hu&s;|band</NOTE> I &s;hall &s;peak of that &s;ubjection which ari&s;es
by rea&s;on of the relations of private life, as that of the
wife to the hu&s;band, the child to the parent, the &s;ervant to
the ma&s;ter. With re&s;pect to the wife; That for any atro|cious
crime, &s;uch as trea&s;on, murder, or fire-rai&s;ing, which
&s;he commits either in company with her hu&s;band, or in com|pliance
with his command, &s;he is equally liable as he to the
ordinary pains, this never was denied to be law: for the&s;e
things are <HI>mala in &s;e,</HI> and again&s;t all the original feelings
of right or humanity, which are paramount to the duties
<PB N="42" REF="99">
of the relation. To give but one in&s;tance of a rule which
is &s;o obviou&s;ly nece&s;&s;ary:<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 18. 1735.</NOTE>. In the ca&s;e of James Brown and
Elizabeth Chalmers his wife, where the charge was for

&s;u&s;tained as a capital dittay again&s;t both.<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The Lords find, That James Brown pannell, having at the time and place lybelled beat or cur&s;ed the decea&s;ed Anna Cockburn his mother, relevant to infer the pain of death, and confi&s;cation of moveables; as al&s;o, Find that the &s;aid James Brown and Elizabeth Chalmers, the other pannell, that they or either of them, having at the time and place lybelled, beaten the &s;aid Anna to that degree, that &s;he of the &s;troaks given her, did &s;hortly thereafter dye; or that they, or either of them, were art and part of the murder of the &s;aid Anna, relevant to infer the fore&s;aid pains; and, <HI>&s;eparatim,</HI> the &s;aid Lords find, That at time and place ly|belled, &s;he the &s;aid Elizabeth Chalmers having beaten the &s;aid A.

<P>BUT even with re&s;pect to the le&s;s heinous offences, &s;uch
as theft, re&s;et of theft, forgery, or the like, I cannot learn
that our law, like that of England<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">See Black&s;tone, vol. iv. p. 28.</NOTE>, will be &s;o indulgent
to her, as to pre&s;ume in her favour, that what &s;he does

<P>AND truly I &s;ee nothing exceptionable in the di&s;po&s;ition of
our law: becau&s;e the ordinary ca&s;e will be, that the &s;pou&s;es
mutually confirm each other in their profligacy, or if there
be &s;eduction in the ca&s;e, it may as well be on the part of the
woman, as the man. The utmo&s;t lenity, therefore, to which
our practice might be inclined, would be to excu&s;e the wife
for venial tre&s;pa&s;&s;es or petty crimes, to which her obedience
of his orders may have con&s;trained her, and to mitigate
her &s;entence for the more grave offences, if the circum&s;tan|ces
of the ca&s;e make it rea&s;onable to believe, that &s;he is the
le&s;s guilty of the two. Perhaps, it may al&s;o be expected,
that in the ca&s;e of threats or violence employed by the
hu&s;band to coerce her, a le&s;&s;er degree of terror &s;hall excu&s;e
the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the wife, who is habitually &s;ubject to his
<PB N="45" REF="102">
power, and has not the &s;ame means of e&s;cape from his rent|ment,
as a &s;tranger. La&s;t of all, it is not to be believed
that in any ca&s;e the wife &s;hall be held guilty, or be impli|cated
as art and part of the hu&s;band's crime, by affording
him that harbourage or concealment and comfort after the
fact, which the feelings of nature and duty require of her
at that &s;ea&s;on of di&s;tre&s;s and terror, when her fidelity has
become his only refuge<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Uxor alicujus de&s;pon&s;ata, non tenetur virum &s;uum accu&s;are, nec furtum &s;uum, nec feloniam detegere; cum ip&s;a &s;ui ip&s;ius pote&s;tatem non habeat. <HI>Stat. Will. cap. 19. No.</HI> 1.</NOTE>. Neither, if &s;he were di&s;po&s;ed,
is it to be pre&s;umed that &s;he has it in her power, to refu&s;e
him this a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>2. WITH re&s;pect to children.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Subjection of the Child to the Pa|rent.</NOTE> If, with the father's pre|&s;ence
and command, or perhaps in this in&s;tance his com|mand
without his pre&s;ence, there concur the great youth
of the child, it may procure him a mitigation of the or|dinary
pains, in the ca&s;e of a high crime, or perhaps en|tirely
ab&s;olve him, if the offence be venial or trifling. As
it did in the ca&s;e of John Rae,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 21. 1662.</NOTE> a boy of twelve years
old, who being pro&s;ecuted for &s;tealing four &s;heep, in com|pany
with his father, was a&s;&s;oilzied by the Court, &startq;in
re&s;pect of his nonage as &s;aid, and that what he did was
in obedience to his father's command.&endq; Mackenzie
hath quoted this ca&s;e as in proof of the <HI>general</HI> po&s;i|tion,
That the command of the father will entirely free the
child from the guilt of the inferior offences; and on another
occa&s;ion<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Tit. Puni&s;hments, No. 5.</NOTE> he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf more largely, as if this of it&s;elf
would al&s;o mitigate the pain of the more atrocious crimes.
<PB N="46" REF="103">
But it is plain that this deci&s;ion, which is mainly grounded
in the <HI>age</HI> of the pannel<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The plea is entered for him in the record in the&s;e words: &startq;That John Rae younger, not being as yet twelve years of age, and &s;o not <HI>doli capax,</HI> ought not to be put to the knowledge of ane a&s;&s;ize.&endq;</NOTE>, will not &s;upport &s;o broad a privi|lege;
neither have I met with any other judgment which
atributes any higher power to the command of a father,
than as a favourable circum&s;tance, along with others, to ex|tenuate
the guilt of the child. In the ca&s;e, particularly of
John Mackinto&s;h,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 9. 1673.</NOTE> and Angus his &s;on, where the father's or|der
to commit the &s;laughter was libelled, and which was
fully debated on all the other points, no &s;uch plea for the
&s;on was even ventured to be maintained. In that of Donald
and Charles Robert&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 6, &amp; 9. 1671.</NOTE> it was, however &s;tated, and upon
full pleading was repelled; though the ca&s;e was thus far
favourable, that the&s;e pannels were boys, alleged to be un|der
fourteen years of age, and the crime was only the ca&s;t|ing
down of certain hou&s;es, and carrying off the materials,
to which their father claimed right as his own. Mention
has al&s;o been made of the ca&s;e of Samuel Pirrie, in later
times, where the in&s;tigation of a mother-in-law to a boy of
fourteen to &s;teal, had not even the effect of &s;aving him from
judgment of death. Neverthele&s;s, as in the ca&s;e of a wife,
it may be true that greater allowance &s;hall be made for ac|tual
coercion or violence employed again&s;t the child, becau&s;e
of the &s;ituation of dependence, and habit of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion,
wherein he &s;tands with re&s;pect to the father.</P>
<P>3. The ca&s;e of a &s;ervant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Subjec|tion of a Ser|vant.</NOTE> according to Mackenzie<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Tit. Art and Part, No. 5.</NOTE>, is
nearly the &s;ame as that of a child; &s;o that the command
<PB N="47" REF="104">
of the ma&s;ter entirely excu&s;es him in the le&s;&s;er crimes, and
even &s;aves him from the ordinary pain of the more atrocious,
if the ma&s;ter is known to be cruel. But I conceive, that in
this he is rather to be under&s;tood as &s;peaking with relation to
tho&s;e ca&s;es, where, be&s;ide the order, the &s;ervant has to allege
actual coercion by the ma&s;ter, and the rea&s;onable fear of vio|lence,
again&s;t which he has no &s;ure or near protection. As,
for in&s;tance, if a per&s;on ignorantly engages as &s;ervant to a
Highland depredator, and is carried out upon an expedition
by his ma&s;ter and his a&s;&s;ociates, who, with threats and drawn
&s;words, compel him to accompany them, and be pre&s;ent at
their exce&s;&s;es. At lea&s;t, if Mackenzie meant to lay down this
po&s;ition generally, his doctrine, for aught that I can find, is not
grounded in the practice of the Court, as well as it &s;eems not
to be &s;afe nor rea&s;onable in it&s;elf. A plea of this &s;ort was &s;et
up in the ca&s;e of Dougal Macfarlane,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 1737.</NOTE> tried for way-laying
and beating an exci&s;e-officer, &s;o that he died; which he alleg|ed
was done upon the order of his ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s, and in
revenge of their quarrel<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">&startq; And in le&s;&s;er crimes, the command of the ma&s;ter excu&s;eth altogether, <HI>Lex Homo, ff. ad Leg. Aquil.</HI> Now, I &s;ub&s;ume in the terms of this, that what|ever was done by me in this affair, was done by the command of my ma&s;ter or Mrs Macara, both, or one or other of them. &hellip; Whatever it was that happened, or was intended, all was done at the command or de&s;ire of my &s;aid ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s. If they had bid kill, I own it might have looked odd to plead their mandate, for a crime that nature &s;tarts at, but to <HI>cuff</HI> is not &s;o &s;hock|ing to nature, and a ma&s;ter or mi&s;tre&s;s will readily be obeyed in &s;uch a ca&s;e by their &s;ervant, e&s;pecially in the <HI>Highlands,</HI> where almo&s;t unlimited obedience is paid to &s;uperiors, and &s;uch cha&s;ti&s;ements not much reckoned on. And the mandator is liable for the exce&s;s as well as for the preci&s;e fact he commi&s;&s;ioned to be done.&endq; This is a pa&s;&s;age from the information for the pannel.</NOTE>. But this and all his other defen|ces
were repelled. The like defence had the &s;ame i&s;&s;ue in
the prior ca&s;e of James Hamilton and others, tenants and
<PB N="48" REF="105">
dependents of the Earl of Ro&s;eberry, who pled their ma|&s;ter's
warrant for deforcing certain officers in the execution
of a poinding of his effects.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 3. 11. 1726.</NOTE> They were convicted, and
had &s;entence for the &s;tatutory pains of deforcement. More
expre&s;sly &s;till, the &s;ame judgment had been given in the
older and more favourable ca&s;e of James Graham.<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 8. and July 1. 1717.</NOTE> This
man was accu&s;ed of a robbery, committed by him in com|pany
with the noted Rob Roy Macgrigor and his gang.
Two defences were pleaded for him; the one that he was co|erced
by force of arms, and dread of his life, the other that
he was a &s;ervant under the command of Roy or of a per&s;on
who was one of his gang, and was therefore to be excu&s;ed
from the ordinary pain; in &s;upport of which po&s;ition, the
authority of Mackenzie was produced. Now, only the fir&s;t
of the&s;e defences was &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P>4. IN the ca&s;e of per&s;ons who are not connected by any
of the&s;e relations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Plea of Compul&s;ion.</NOTE> it &s;eems proper to di&s;tingui&s;h between &s;itu|ations
of great commotion, or exten&s;ive danger, and the ordi|nary
&s;ituation of a quiet and well regulated &s;ociety. In
time of war or rebellion, by which the magi&s;trate is over|powered,
and the protection of the law &s;u&s;pended, allowance
mu&s;t be made for individuals, if, in this helple&s;s &s;tate, they
to a certain extent &s;uffer the great law of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation to
govern their conduct for the time. A per&s;on is not there|fore
guilty of trea&s;on, who being in a part of the country
that is commanded by the rebels, yields them again&s;t his
will &s;upply of money, or of arms and provi&s;ions, having no
means of declining their demands, and being in the rea&s;on|able
fear of military execution if he refu&s;e. I &s;hall not even
&s;ay whether this may not go the length of excu&s;ing him,
though he be with them for a time in arms, provided he
<PB N="49" REF="106">
prove a &s;pecial and outrageous compul&s;ion of him in that
particular, and that he quit them with the fir&s;t opportunity,
and do no act of ho&s;tility while he remains with them, other
than is fairly imputable to the con&s;traint of his &s;ituation.
There is an in&s;tance of the former in the ca&s;e of William
and John Riddell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 7. 1681.</NOTE> indicted for trea&s;on, in furni&s;hing the re|bels
with provi&s;ions, and tran&s;porting their cannon. The
Court &startq;find the defence proponed for the pannel relevant,
he always proving <HI>vis major</HI> and force to every act of
furni&s;hing the rebels with meat and drink, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting
them in carrying of their cannons, to elide that part of
the dittay<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The a&s;&s;ize find, &startq;That the woman did carry ale, and did deliver ale and bread, to be carried to the rebels; but finds it not proven, that the pannell William Riddell had any acce&s;&s;ion thereto; and as to the furni&s;hing of malt lybelled, they all in one voice a&s;&s;oilzie the pannell <HI>&s;impliciter, becau&s;e he was compelled thereto.</HI>&endq; On the 21&s;t November, he was ordered to be &s;et at liber|ty, on taking the te&s;t.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>THE &s;ame excu&s;e may even be admitted in ca&s;es of le&s;s
exten&s;ive commotion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;es of Crime on Compul&s;ion.</NOTE> if the &s;ituation be truly &s;uch with re|&s;pect
to the individual, that he is in a &s;tate of helple&s;&s;ne&s;s
and danger for the time. A mob, for in&s;tance, or tumultu|ous
convocation, are moving on their enterpri&s;e; and on
their way, as &s;ometimes happens, they take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
&s;uch as they meet, and compel them, in appearance at lea&s;t,
to take part in the adventure, and augment their &s;trength.
There can be no doubt that &s;uch an allegation, duly quali|fied,
and made out by apt <HI>indicia,</HI> and not contradicted by
other circum&s;tances of an oppo&s;ite character in the behavi|our
of the pannel, is relevant to acquit him of the charge.
Here I may quote the ca&s;e of Andrew Fairney, James Pur|die,
<PB N="50" REF="107">
and others, where, in as far as concerns Purdic, the
interlocutor is thus:<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 25. 1720.</NOTE> &startq;And for eliding the qualification
libelled again&s;t James Purdie, <HI>viz.</HI> That he carried and
beat a drum among&s;t any of the &s;aid mobs, &s;u&s;tains the de|fence
relevant, that he was forced and compelled thereto
by the &s;aid mob.&endq; The defence of con&s;traint and compul|&s;ion
was al&s;o found relevant in the ca&s;e of William Gilchri&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 9. and 12. 1741.</NOTE>
indicted as one of a mob, who broke into and plundered a
mill<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">&startq;Find the lybell and &s;everal articles thereof relevant to infer the pains of law; but allow the pannell to prove the alledged force and continuance there|of, and his conduct and behaviour during the time of the riot, for elideing or alleviating any part of the &s;aid lybell.&endq;</NOTE>. Likewi&s;e in the ca&s;e of Robert Main and others,
we find both the rule and the proper limitations of it
&s;et forth as follows:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 11. 1725.</NOTE> &startq;Finds the &s;aid Robert Main's de|fence,
<HI>viz.</HI> That he was forced to take a gun by the
di&s;orderly people who were running that way, and who
threatened to knock him down if he would not take
it, relevant to exculpate him as to his being in arms,
by having the &s;aid gun in that place where he was &s;o for|ced,
but not relevant as to his having the gun in any other
place, unle&s;s the force was &s;o continued, that he&punc; could not
with &s;afety lay his gun a&s;ide, or withdraw from the com|pany
who forced him.&endq;</P>
<P>ONE of the charges, which &s;eems more readily than mo&s;t
others to admit this defence, is that of piracy: Becau&s;e it
often happens that tho&s;e who are engaged in this lawle&s;s
and de&s;perate cour&s;e of life, do by main force, from which
there is no relief in the&s;e circum&s;tances, compel the ma|riners
on board the prizes which they make, to pa&s;s into
the piratical ve&s;&s;el, and take part with them in their mi&s;|deeds.
On the trial, therefore, of Roger Hews and &s;ixteen
<PB N="51" REF="108">
others, in the Court of Admiralty, the judge &startq;&s;u&s;tains the
the defence proponed for the pannels,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 15. 1720.</NOTE> that they, or any
one or more of them, were compelled to join them&s;elves
with the pirates by force, or through fear, by the pirates
threatening the pannels to deprive them of their lives,
and that during the committing of the &s;everal piracies
&s;et forth in the indictment, the &s;aid pannels continued
under &s;uch force or fear.&endq; The jury &startq;found the de|fences
of force, and fear of death, and &s;ickne&s;s, pro|ven,&endq;
in favour of &s;even of the pannels, who were ac|cordingly
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the bar.</P>
<P>FARTHER &s;till, there may be &s;ituations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;es of Crime on Compul&s;ion.</NOTE> though more un|common
now than they once were, of a more &s;pecial and
private violence, which &s;hall be judged by the &s;ame rule.
In the beginning of this century, while &s;ome parts of Scot|land
had not yet been reduced to the due &s;tate of di&s;cipline,
or &s;en&s;e of order, but were infe&s;ted with gangs of ru&s;&s;ians,
who levied contribution, and committed all manner of ex|ce&s;s
without fear or re&s;traint, the condition of tho&s;e quar|ters
was truly little different from a &s;tate of war. So that a
per&s;on, him&s;elf nowi&s;e di&s;po&s;ed to &s;uch a way of life, might for
a time, through near neighbourhood, or by rea&s;on of offence
given them, or the like, find him&s;elf entangled in &s;ome &s;hare
of a criminal enterpri&s;e, entirely again&s;t his will. The ca&s;e,
already mentioned, of James Graham, &s;eems to have been
of this de&s;cription. The charge again&s;t him was, that in
company with Rob Roy and his gang, he had gone armed
to Chapel Arroch, and there &s;eized, carried off, and robbed
the Duke of Montro&s;e's &s;teward, who had gone thither to
collect his ma&s;ter's rents. He pled, that in the night pre|ceding
this robbery, the hou&s;e in which he lived was be&s;et
<PB N="52" REF="109">
by Rob Roy, with fifteen armed men, who commanded him
to come forth, and on his refu&s;al threatened him with pi&s;tol
and drawn &s;word, to &s;hoot or cleave him to the teeth, and
at length dragged him out and forced him away, as well as
they renewed their threats, on his attempting to e&s;cape from
them in the cour&s;e of their expedition. The&s;e things the
Court found jointly relevant <HI>&s;impliciter</HI> to acquit him. As
al&s;o, they found it &s;ufficient to re&s;trict the charge to an ar|bitrary
pain, that though not at fir&s;t forced out by &s;uch ex|treme
violence, he was, however, under re&s;traint by force,
at the time when the robbery was committed<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">1&s;t July 1717. &startq;Su&s;tain the defence proponed for the pannell, <HI>viz.</HI> That he was compelled by being threatened with a pi&s;tol or drawn &s;word, and drag|ged out of his ma&s;ter's hou&s;e by two of Rob Roy's men, the day before com|mitting of the crimes lybelled, and that he continued under re&s;traint by force of arms, the time of committing the &s;aid crimes, jointly relevant to a&s;&s;oilzie <HI>&s;impliciter</HI> from the indictment; and likewi&s;e &s;u&s;tain this defence, that the pan|nell, the time of committing the &s;aid crimes lybelled, was under re&s;traint by force, relevant to re&s;trict the indictment to an arbitrary puni&s;hment; and repell the haill other defences proponed for the pannell.&endq;</NOTE>. The jury
found it proved, &startq;That he was pre&s;ent in arms along with
Roy and others at the time when the robbery was com|mitted,
but that he was forced into the &s;ervice in man|ner
mentioned, and that he was not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of arms to
make re&s;i&s;tance at the time.&endq; Upon which verdict he
was a&s;&s;oilzied.</P>
<P>IN this particular ca&s;e, the defence &s;eems to have been
fully made out. But generally, and with relation to the or|dinary
condition of a well regulated &s;ociety, in which eve|ry
individual is under the &s;hield of the law, and has oppor|tunity
of re&s;orting to that protection upon any apprehen|&s;ion
of violence, this is at lea&s;t a difficult plea, and which
will hardly be effectual again&s;t the charge of any atrocious
<PB N="53" REF="110">
crime, without the concurrence of the&s;e qualifications; an
immediate danger of death or great bodily harm, an inabi|lity
to e&s;cape that danger, or re&s;i&s;t the violence, a back|ward
and &s;ubordinate part in the bu&s;ine&s;s, and di&s;clo&s;ure
of the guilt, as well as re&s;titution of the profit, with the
fir&s;t &s;afe and convenient occa&s;ion. For, if either the pan|nel
take a very active part in the execution of the crime, or
if he conceal the guilt, and detain his &s;hare of the profit,
after his return to a &s;tate of freedom; any of the&s;e replies
will in a great mea&s;ure elide his defence.</P>
<P>5. I SHALL be very brief in &s;peaking of that &s;ubjection,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Subjection of Magi&s;trate to the Law.</NOTE>
which ari&s;es out of the relations of a public nature, as be|tween
the judge and the legi&s;lature, the magi&s;trate and the
mini&s;ters of the law under him, or &s;oldier and commanding
officer.</P>
<P>IT may be a que&s;tion in morals, in the ca&s;e of a judge
who finds it enjoined him to execute an unju&s;t and oppre&s;|&s;ive
law, whether he ought not rather to re&s;ign the office,
which engages him in &s;uch difficulties, and thus &s;ets law and
con&s;cience at war. But in no human tribunal can the &s;ub|ject
of any land be called in que&s;tion for execution of the
&s;ub&s;i&s;ting laws: It is only in virtue of tho&s;e &s;ame laws that
he is ve&s;ted with the office of judge, and in oppo&s;ing or re|fu&s;ing
to obey them, he would de&s;troy the very &s;ource of
his own authority and commi&s;&s;ion. The judges of former
times were not therefore puni&s;hable for trying traitors in
ab&s;ence, after the &s;tatute which pa&s;&s;ed in that behalf, nor. for
executing the laws again&s;t witchcraft, upon conviction ob|tained
according to the approved cu&s;tomary mode of evi|dence
in the practice of their day.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="111">
IT will not in every ca&s;e be governed by the &s;ame rule,
if,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Subjection of Officer to the Magi&s;trate.</NOTE> through gro&s;s ignorance or carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, the magi&s;trate
pronounce an unlawful &s;entence, which is carried into effect
by the inferior mini&s;ters of the law, upon his warrant.
Take for example the ca&s;e of a murderer, executed upon
&s;entence of the Sheriff-court, which cannot try for murder,
or the ca&s;e of capital &s;entence, which erroneou&s;ly orders
execution to take place within the period, which is allowed
the convict by the &s;tatute in that behalf. It may &s;eem that
there is room for a di&s;tinction in this matter, according to the
officer's &s;tate of information, at the time when he proceeded.
If it can be &s;hewn that he was in the knowledge of the nullity,
or had rea&s;onable ground of &s;u&s;picion on the &s;ubject, which
may &s;ometimes be from the nature of the thing it&s;elf, as if
the order were to poi&s;on a convict, or privately to &s;trangle
him in goal, certainly he &s;hall have no excu&s;e in the com|mand
of his &s;uperior, who&s;e wrong he thus adopts and takes
upon him&s;elf; for if in the&s;e circum&s;tances he obey the
warrant, it is out of choice, and he cannot be held free of
<HI>malus animus</HI> towards the per&s;on, whom he thus wilfully, de|liberately,
and unnece&s;&s;arily de&s;troys. But, which is more
probable, if the officer proceeded without any knowledge or
&s;u&s;picion of the wrong, and having the accu&s;tomed warrant
under the hand of his &s;uperior, this &s;eems either to be no
crime at all on his part, or, at lea&s;t, it is both lower in de|gree,
and of a different kind, than that of the judge, and
can only be puni&s;hed in the officer, on the expedient prin|ciple
of teaching the highe&s;t caution to all concerned in the
conduct of this intere&s;ting part of ju&s;tice. For, in like
manner as the law is paramount to all cla&s;&s;es of people in
the kingdom, &s;o where the political e&s;tabli&s;hment places
one officer in authority over another, the obedience of the
<PB N="55" REF="112">
inferior is truly obedience to the law, which has given him
this general direction for his conduct. Neither, if he was
not warned, can he be held blameable or carele&s;s, that he
did not di&s;cover the error into which the magi&s;trate had
fallen; for he was entitled to repo&s;e in confidence of the
&s;uperior &s;kill and attention of that per&s;on in the department
of his duty. He intended to do a lawful act, and had right
to think it &s;uch; whereby the error in that re&s;pect is thus,
as to him, an error in point of fact only; which ought to
excu&s;e him, as that &s;ort of error does in other ca&s;es. It is
quite another que&s;tion, where a per&s;on, acting of his own
choice, happens, upon an erroneous apprehen&s;ion of the law,
to do an unlawful thing, to plunder a wrecked ve&s;&s;el, for in|&s;tance,
or to kill an outlawed or excommunicated per&s;on.
For the judge cannot excu&s;e this ignorance in one who is
acting without nece&s;&s;ity, and who ought therefore to be &s;ure
of his warrant, before he venture to put forth his hand
again&s;t the goods or per&s;on of his neighbour.</P>
<P>WITH regard to &s;oldiers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Subjection of Soldiers to Of|ficers.</NOTE> who are trained to a &s;till &s;tricter
di&s;cipline, and are bound to obedience of orders by far
higher penalties, I &s;hall only &s;ay, that any plea which may
be grounded upon the&s;e favourable con&s;iderations, mu&s;t at
lea&s;t be received under certain provi&s;ions, without which
it would both be very dangerous and unju&s;t. The order
mu&s;t be &s;uch which falls within the bounds of the offi|cer's
commi&s;&s;ion, and known cu&s;tomary line of duty, and
though given in his proper department, it mu&s;t farther be at
lea&s;t an excu&s;able order, or of that nature to be the &s;ubject of
different opinions, not a plain injury and aggre&s;&s;ion on his
part. If he &s;hould order out a party to re&s;cue him from a

<PB N="56" REF="113">
or other injury which en&s;ues upon &s;o irregular an enter|prize,
would be at the equal hazard of the officer, and of
all who are concerned in the execution of it. And the &s;ame
would be true, if, being on guard with his party, he &s;hould
order them to fire upon an inoffen&s;ive meeting of the people;
a command which he is puni&s;hable for giving, and which
they may lawfully di&s;obey. The ca&s;e of William Fergu&s;on
and others, &s;oldiers in the Earl of Errol's regiment of mi|litia,
was a plain unfavourable ca&s;e in both of the&s;e re&s;pects:
For the pannels and their party had been &s;ent out to poind for
deficiencies in the quota of militia-men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 5. and 6. 1674.</NOTE> upon the warrant
of their officer only, who had no right to give &s;uch a war|rant,
and they had been guilty of great exce&s;s and precipi|tation
in putting it to execution. But ca&s;es of this de&s;crip|tion
have been rare. And in tho&s;e, which more frequently
happen, of an ambiguous character, the humane con&s;idera|tion
of the &s;ituation of the &s;oldier, who has acted in the be|lief
of duty, and under the habit and con&s;traint of military
di&s;cipline, has generally made the pro&s;ecution be confined
to the officer alone, as &s;ource and author of the wrong.
This was the cour&s;e in the ca&s;e of Captain Wallace;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 1692.</NOTE> and
in the &s;till more noted ca&s;e of Captain Porteous;<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 1736.</NOTE> though in
both the order to fire had been obeyed by all, or many of
the party, under the officer's command. But I do not intend
to enter at large, into an article of &s;uch delicate di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>6. I KNOW not,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plea of Compul|&s;ion by Want.</NOTE> if it is nece&s;&s;ary to take notice of one
other &s;ort of con&s;traint, that which ari&s;es from the pre&s;&s;ure
of extreme want, and has tempted to the doing of &s;uch a
thing, as &s;erves to the &s;upport of nature for the time. As
might be expected, juri&s;ts have differed about the ju&s;tice of
puni&s;hing in &s;uch a ca&s;e, &s;ome affirming that the notion of
<PB N="57" REF="114">
dole is utterly excluded in the&s;e circum&s;tances of mi&s;ery, or
at lea&s;t that they are a plea to mitigation of the ordinary
pains, while others deny that they are at all available in law.
With us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">B. 4. tit. 16.</NOTE> reference is made in &s;upport of the merciful opi|nion,
to that chapter of the <HI>Regiam Maje&s;tatem,</HI> entitled, <HI>de
Lege Burthyn&s;ack,</HI> under which, according to one con&s;truc|tion
of it, a man is not at all to be puni&s;hed for the theft of
a calf, or a ram, or of as much meat as he can carry on his
back. But the pa&s;&s;age does not di&s;tingui&s;h whether the
thief be nece&s;&s;itous or not; and taking the whole &s;ections of
the chapter in connection, the meaning may rather &s;eem to
be, that for a theft to this amount, a per&s;on &s;hall not be
puni&s;hed capitally. In which &s;en&s;e it had been under&s;tood
by Skene<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Skene's Treati&s;e of Crimes, cap. 13. No. 9.</NOTE>, who &s;ays, with reference to this law of Burdin|&s;eck,
that &s;uch a thief &startq;&s;hould not be put to death but
&s;hould be &s;courged.&endq; Whatever may be its true meaning,
the pa&s;&s;age will not now be of much weight in the &s;olution
of this important que&s;tion; which &s;eems not to be attend|ed
with any peculiar difficulty, if, in&s;tead of re&s;orting to ar|tificial
arguments, it be but treated on the obvious and &s;ub|&s;tantial
grounds in the nature of the ca&s;e. Certainly there is
a wide difference between a &s;ingle act of theft committed
in this &s;ituation of di&s;tre&s;s, and the rapacious inva&s;ion of
the property of others, by one who makes a trade of &s;uch
inju&s;tice. Yet, on the other &s;ide, the danger, or rather the
impracticability, is evident, of incorporating this exception
into the common law and practice of the land, and &s;ubjec|ting
it, like other defences, to the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the judge
and jury. If there were no other ob&s;tacle, where is the
po&s;&s;ible rule, by which to &s;ettle the due mea&s;ure of di&s;tre&s;s,
which &s;hall excu&s;e? Or how &s;hall the real nece&s;&s;ity be known
<PB N="58" REF="115">
from that which is pretended, or that which comes of inno|cent
and unavoidable misfortune, from the ju&s;t con&s;equences
of a vicious or criminal cour&s;e of conduct? Yet to di&s;tin|gui&s;h
in this matter according to the &s;ources and occa&s;ions
of the indigence, and therefore to inve&s;tigate the whole
hi&s;tory of the offender's life, would be indi&s;pen&s;ible to ju|&s;tice,
if in any ca&s;e the law were to li&s;ten to this excu&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT truly, there are far higher con&s;iderations again&s;t the
admitting of &s;uch a rule, which would at once infringe all
&s;ecurity of property, by confounding the common notions
of right and hone&s;ty among the people, and throwing into
every man's own hand the e&s;timation, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance,
of his own wants, and of the impo&s;&s;ibility of relieving them
in any more lawful cour&s;e. It is grounded, therefore, in
&s;ound rea&s;on, and &s;ub&s;tantial ju&s;tice, and is, as I conceive,
the &s;ettled law of Scotland, that the judge &s;hall apply the or|dinary
pains of law in this, as in every other ca&s;e, where a
per&s;on knowingly, and for his own advantage, has taken
the property of his neighbour; leaving it to the nece&s;&s;itous
offender to &s;upplicate his relief from the Sovereign, who is
the &s;ource of mercy, and who will not refu&s;e to li&s;ten, if
there be cau&s;e for him to interpo&s;e. Thus the rigid and &s;a|lutary
precept of the law is maintained entire, and humani|ty
at the &s;ame time is con&s;ulted, without the ri&s;k of any of
the&s;e multiplied evils and di&s;orders, which would follow on
a more enlarged &s;cheme of indulgence. And herein, ac|cording
to the judicious ob&s;ervation of Judge Black&s;tone,
appears the benefit of that monarchical form of government,
which &s;o naturally admits of this gracious prerogative,
which in more popular governments is the object of jea|lou&s;y,
and cannot &s;o ea&s;ily, nor to the &s;ame advantage, be
arranged.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">OF THEFT AND STOUTHRIEF.</HEAD>
<P>IN con&s;idering that cla&s;s of offences which are committed
again&s;t the property of another,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. II.</NOTE> I naturally begin with
the crime of theft, that &s;ort of inva&s;ion of property, which
being attended with a profit to the offender, as well as a da|mage
to the owner, is more frequently committed than any
other. And fir&s;t, of the nature of the crime: whereof all
the nece&s;&s;ary qualifications &s;eem to be &s;et forth in that &s;hort
de&s;cription of it, given in the civil law, <HI>contrectatio rei frau|dulo&s;a,
lucri faciendi gratia;</HI> the felonious taking and carry|ing
away of the property of another, for profit.</P>
<P>I. THE fundamental circum&s;tance, and which all the
others only qualify, is this of the <HI>taking,</HI> or as our lawyers,
after the &s;tile of the civil law, have &s;ometimes termed it,
The Contrectation of the Thing. In which it is implied,
that the thing has not previou&s;ly been in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
the thief, but in that of the owner, or &s;ome other per&s;on for
him, out of which the thief, without con&s;ent of the owner,
removes it. Now with this article, &s;imple as at fir&s;t it ap|pears
to be, opens a wide field of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; as upon the
<PB N="60" REF="117">
due under&s;tanding of this matter, in &s;ome mea&s;ure depends
the di&s;tinction between theft, and tho&s;e other criminal, but
as the law deems them, inferior offences, of fraud, &s;windling,
and breach of tru&s;t, which are nearly allied to theft, and
liable to be confounded with it. And here, without pretend|ing
to furni&s;h an invariable criterion for di&s;tingui&s;hing
the&s;e offences one from another, or to re&s;olve all tho&s;e nice
debates, which have exerci&s;ed the ingenuity of the able&s;t
lawyers of either kingdom, I &s;hall rather content my&s;elf
with &s;tating, on the one and the other part, certain de&s;crip|tions
of ca&s;es, which are clearly referible to different deno|minations
of crime; hopeful that in this cour&s;e the circle
of controver&s;y &s;hall at lea&s;t be narrowed, if not &s;ome notion
attained of the true principle, on which the deci&s;ion of the
&s;till more difficult &s;ituations may turn.</P>
<P>1. IN the fir&s;t place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;tinction of Theft and Swindling.</NOTE> all ca&s;es &s;eem to fall under the notion
of fraud or &s;windling only, and not of theft, in which the
pannel attains po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the thing on a title and bargain
as for the <HI>property,</HI> upon credit, though the bargain be ac|compli&s;hed
by means of cozenage and fal&s;ehood. As in the
ca&s;e of one, who fal&s;ely pretends to be partner of a certain
thriving hou&s;e, and thus buys and gets delivery of goods, to
be paid at a future day. Or as in the ca&s;e of Thomas Hall,
tried in July 1789, who came to Edinburgh, fal&s;ely pretending
to be a trader, and in pro&s;ecution of this plan hired and
opened &s;hop, and having, on the tru&s;t of this character, ob|tained
goods from &s;undry dealers upon credit, &s;uddenly di&s;|appeared,
and carried off the goods along with him. In all
ca&s;es of this de&s;cription, the offender's wrong lieth only in
the fal&s;e and fraudulent inducement, which he has held
forth to the owner, for prevailing on him to contract. But
<PB N="61" REF="118">
how unfairly &s;oever he obtained it, he hath actually had the
con&s;ent of the owner to convey that thing to him in pro|perty,
to be his, and in all re&s;pects at his di&s;po&s;al, till the
day of payment come. Which bargain being followed with
delivery of the thing, the property thereof, notwith&s;tanding
the fraud, in the mean time pa&s;&s;eth to the buyer; in &s;o
much that any one who &s;hould <HI>bona fide</HI> buy and get deli|very
of this &s;ame thing from him in cour&s;e of trade, would
not even be liable to the fir&s;t owner's claim of re&s;titution,
which is only per&s;onal again&s;t his own cu&s;tomer, the author
of the wrong. The owner, therefore, has him&s;elf only to
blame in &s;uch a ca&s;e, that having his choice to &s;ell on credit
or for ready money, and thus to be ab&s;olutely &s;ecure, he vo|luntarily
cho&s;e the former, and knew not the per&s;on better,
whom he dealt with on &s;uch terms. He relied, in contract|ing,
either on the faith of the buyer, that he would not at|tempt
to cheat him, or on his own &s;agacity, for di&s;covering
any &s;uch evil purpo&s;e, and his intere&s;t mu&s;t be ruled accord|ingly;
whereas in the ca&s;e of a theftous ab&s;traction, there is
no giving of the thing to the offender, out of any reliance on
him, and to be his own, but a taking of it by him, without
even a &s;eeming title of property or con&s;ent of the owner.
In the ca&s;e of Hall, the offence was therefore pro&s;ecuted
as fraud, and not as theft<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Notice may al&s;o be taken of the ca&s;e of Robert Taylor, 26th January 1674, who was charged with theft and &s;touthrief on this ground, that the parties being together at a fair, and having gone into an alehou&s;e, they there bargained for the &s;ale of ninety-five oxen, at &s;o much a-head, which was to be paid either in&s;tantly, <HI>or within a few days.</HI> The buyer's &s;ervant, in the mean time, without the pur|&s;uer's con&s;ent, drove off the cattle cro&s;s the border, and the pur&s;uer having fol|lowed to Carli&s;le, he was there, under pretence of a debt to the pannel, impri|&s;oned. On this <HI>&s;pecies facti,</HI> where the intromi&s;&s;ion was on a bargain of <HI>&s;ale,</HI> and not in&s;i&s;ted to have been <HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> for ready money, and not accompanied with a pointed averment, that the whole tran&s;action was from the fir&s;t a trick, the pur&s;uer found it nece&s;&s;ary to de&s;ert his charge of <HI>theft,</HI> and turn it into a charge of oppre&s;&s;ion, which, in the end, was found irrelevant.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="119">
2. EVEN if the thing be delivered by the owner upon
&s;ome lower title than that of property,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;tinction of Theft and Breach of Tru&s;t.</NOTE> as in the ca&s;e of a
watch given to another in loan, or of a hor&s;e let to hyre,
or a pack of goods &s;ent by a carrier, to be delivered at a cer|tain
place, the after-conver&s;ion of the thing to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or's
own u&s;e, by &s;elling the watch or hor&s;e, or opening the pack
and ab&s;tracting the contents or part thereof, though it is a
wrong, and even a criminal act, does not however amount
to the crime of theft. The rea&s;on lies here, That there
has been no felonious <HI>taking</HI> of the thing out of the owner's
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Upon the&s;e ca&s;es, as above imagined, the man
at fir&s;t had obtained the thing hone&s;tly, by a fair contract,
in ordinary cour&s;e of bu&s;ine&s;s, and meaning no other, as at
that time, but to re&s;tore or deliver it, according to his du|ty.
At the in&s;tant, therefore, of delivery made in pur&s;u|ance
of that contract, the owner's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion cea&s;ed. The
pannel was thence forward in the lawful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for him|&s;elf;
and when he converts it to his own u&s;es, from a pur|po&s;e
which is only afterwards taken up, and is probably &s;ug|ge&s;ted
by his command of the thing, he cannot be held to
have taken it from the owner; &s;ince, without any wrong or
felonious intention, he already had it. To con&s;ider the
thing as returned into the hand of the owner, from the time
when the u&s;e to which it was given had determined, where|by
the after-conver&s;ion of it to the holder's profit might fall
to be deemed a new taking from the owner; this, though
adopted by &s;ome authorities, &s;eems to be a pure artificial,
<PB N="63" REF="120">
and indeed unnatural view of the &s;ituation, and &s;uch as
ought not to have any countenance from the law, becau&s;e
tending to equali&s;e the guilt of two acts, which in them|&s;elves
are of different degrees, and ought to be cha&s;ti&s;ed
with unequal pains. In as much as his depravity, or at lea&s;t
boldne&s;s, is not &s;o great, who is only tempted to keep a
thing, which is already in his hands, and which came fair|ly
into them, compared with that of the per&s;on who exerts
his invention, or makes venture of his per&s;on, feloniou&s;ly
to withdraw the thing from the care and keeping of the
owner.</P>
<P>THE di&s;tinction between the two &s;orts of act will better
appear, if we add but one circum&s;tance to any of the&s;e ca&s;es,
the more clearly to &s;how that the purpo&s;e of lucre was not
the original inducement of the contract, but a new purpo&s;e,
which only aro&s;e after delivery of the thing. As for in|&s;tance,
if the holder of the hired hor&s;e be taken with per|&s;onal
diligence upon his journey, and &s;ell the hor&s;e to his
creditor, to relieve his per&s;on, and receive and &s;pend the ba|lance
of the price. Yet this is not a fundamental alteration
of the ca&s;e, but matter of evidence only, to e&s;tabli&s;h that
the di&s;hone&s;t purpo&s;e has but lately been taken up; a thing,
which if the offender gets the &s;ubject on any common con|tract,
mu&s;t be pre&s;umed in his favour, till proof be made,
by circum&s;tances, that he from the fir&s;t intended to defraud.</P>
<P>3. IF this be true of the&s;e &s;ituations, &s;till le&s;s can there be
any doubt of &s;uch, wherein the whole wrong lies only in the
failure to re-deliver the thing, according to contract or pro|mi&s;e:
As in the ca&s;e of a thing lent me, to be returned by a
certain day, if I keep it longer; or in the ca&s;e of a hor&s;e
hired to a certain place, if I ride it farther in the &s;ame di|rection;
or in the ca&s;e of the carrier, if he keep up the pack
<PB N="64" REF="121">
of goods, but unbroken, and without concealment, after his
arrival at their place of de&s;tination. Were it nothing more,
there is this objection to the charge of theft in the&s;e &s;ituations,
that the circum&s;tances do not yield that deci&s;ive evidence,
which cannot be di&s;pen&s;ed with, of the holder's purpo&s;e to ap|propriate
the thing to him&s;elf. The definition of theft in the
civil law, <HI>L.</HI> 1. No. 3. <HI>Dig. de furtis,</HI> does indeed reach any
u&s;urpation even of the u&s;e or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the thing; but this
can be no rule for our practice, in which the pains of theft
are not patrimonial only, as in the Roman, but reach the
per&s;on, and even the life of the offender.</P>
<P>4. THE &s;ame principle which protects the tre&s;pa&s;&s;er in the
ca&s;e of delivery to him for &s;ome limited and temporary u&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Theft and Breach of Tru&s;t.</NOTE>
will more &s;trongly apply in his favour, in proportion as he
has the thing upon a higher intere&s;t of his own, and by a
contract which was meant to ve&s;t him with a fuller manage|ment
and command of it. A creditor, who has his debtor's
property lying in pledge with him, is not guilty of theft if
he &s;hall irregularly u&s;e or &s;ell it; for &s;uch is his intere&s;t in
the thing, that the owner would be guilty of a crime, and as
&s;ome allege, would even be guilty of theft in certain cir|cum&s;tances,
if he &s;hould &s;ecretly withdraw it from his po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion.
Another apt illu&s;tration may be in that &s;ort of in|tere&s;t,
which a hired &s;ervant hath in the clothes and habili|ments
of his body, furni&s;hed him by his ma&s;ter; which ar|ticles,
though they are not the &s;ervant's property, (&s;ince the
ma&s;ter may in&s;i&s;t that he &s;hall leave them at quitting his
&s;ervice), are, however, far more proper to him than his
ma&s;ter's plate, or other things committed to his keeping,
and belong to him by &s;uch a right, as &s;hall at lea&s;t hinder
any pro&s;ecution of him as a thief, if either he &s;hall run off
<PB N="65" REF="122">
with them upon him, or &s;hall &s;ell them while in the &s;ervice.
This point was tried with us in the ca&s;e of Alexander Steill,
again&s;t whom it was charged,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 13. 1669.</NOTE> that be&s;ide money and wri|tings,
he had carried off certain arms and articles of wear|ing
apparel, the property of Captain Barclay. It was
&s;tated in defence, That the pannel was Captain Barc|lay's
&s;ervant, and received his ma&s;ter's clothes and o|ther
nece&s;&s;ary furniture, to which he need prove no other
right, than by his having the delivery and u&s;e of the ar|ticles;
and that to make a relevant charge, the pur&s;uer
mu&s;t &s;pecify a theftuous contrectation of the clothes, as by
withdrawing them from his ma&s;ter's &s;tudy, cabinet, or
trunks.<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Sir George Lockhart pleads for the pannell, &startq;That although the dittay were more &s;pecial, yet the famen cannot be put to the knowledge of an inque&s;t, be|cau&s;e as to the &s;pecies of the particular goods conde&s;cended on in the pannell's ex|culpation, his intromi&s;&s;ion therewith can import no <HI>theft.</HI> In re&s;pect it is offer|ed to be proven, that the pannell, being &s;ervant to Captain Barclay, did actually wear and make u&s;e of the &s;aid cloaths and goods during that year of his &s;er|vice; and whilk u&s;ing of the &s;amen is &s;ufficient to infer a right thereto, with|out nece&s;&s;ity to prove it otherwi&s;e, and beyond all que&s;tion is &s;ufficient to purge all theftuous contrectation, although the pannell had intromitted and car|ried them away; there being nothing more ordinary than for &s;ervants during their ma&s;ter's &s;ervice to get cloaths and other &s;icklike furniture, and it were mo&s;t ab&s;urd and unju&s;t, that &s;ervants making u&s;e thereof &s;hould not be &s;uch ane qualification of the right and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, as though they did carry them away, it cannot infer the crime of theft again&s;t them.&endq; He afterwards adds in a reply, &startq;The libel mu&s;t be circum&s;tantiate, that it mu&s;t convincingly appear, that the pannell's intromi&s;&s;ion was not warranted by ane preceeding delivery; but was a clear theftuous contrectation, as for example by proving that the goods lybelled, the time of the pannell's intromi&s;&s;ion, were in &s;uch way and manner in Captain Barclay's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, as being in his trunks, cabinets and &s;tudies, as does clearly make out his right thereto.&endq;</NOTE>.

<P>UNDER the &s;ame rule falls the ca&s;e of a factor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Theft and Breach of Tru&s;t.</NOTE> who runs
off with his employer's rents, after receiving them from the
tenants, or even, (which is &s;tronger), the ca&s;e of an over|&s;eer
or &s;teward, entru&s;ted with the management of a farm,
who privately di&s;po&s;es of the grain and other commodities,
the produce of the land, and receives the price to his own
behoof. The wrong of this proceeding does not lie in the
di&s;po&s;al of the things; for this falls under the powers of the
&s;teward's office: Neither will the clande&s;tine manner of
di&s;po&s;al make it theft, or a taking from his ma&s;ter, who has
put the produce out of his own hands, into tho&s;e of the
&s;teward, to be by him admini&s;tred at his di&s;cretion, &s;o he
faithfully account for the value. It is, therefore, in the
&s;hort accounting, and concealment of his receipts, not in
the withdrawing of the &s;pecies or <HI>corpus,</HI> that the guilt of
&s;uch a tre&s;pa&s;s lies, which, though criminal, is however on|ly
a fraud, or breach of tru&s;t, and a di&s;tinct offence from
the&s;t. Such a charge had been brought by the Earl of Ro&s;e|berry
again&s;t his &s;teward Archibald Tait, before the Ju&s;tices
of We&s;t-Lothian, who gave &s;entence for pillory and bani&s;h|ment.
Which being challenged by Tait in a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion,
among other rea&s;ons urged was this, That the Ju&s;tices were
not competent to try a charge of theft. The Court found,
&startq;That the libel or complaint brought by the Earl of Ro&s;e|berry
and the procurator-fi&s;cal again&s;t the &s;aid Archibald
Tait,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 15. 1776.</NOTE> before the Ju&s;tices of Peace of the county of Lin|lithgow,

did not contain a charge of theft, but a charge
of fraudulent concealments of the proceeds of his matter's
goods, and by fal&s;e contrivances endeavouring to prevent
the&s;e proceeds from coming to his ma&s;ter's knowledge;
find that &s;uch charge was competent to be tried by the Ju|&s;tices
without a jury.&endq;</P>
<P>IN general, it &s;eems to be true of all per&s;ons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Theft and Breach of Tru&s;t.</NOTE> who are in
a re&s;pon&s;ible &s;tate as officers, and are entru&s;ted not with the
care only, but the proper po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of money, &s;uch as ca&s;hiers
and tellers of banks, collectors of taxes or parochial rates,
trea&s;urers of bodies corporate, judicial factors and the like,
that they are not puni&s;hable <HI>as thieves,</HI> but as criminals of
an inferior order, for any di&s;hone&s;ty or malver&s;ation in
their charge. It is implied in the nature of &s;uch appoint|ments,
that the officer has more or le&s;s an admini&s;tra|tion,
a di&s;cretionary power, over the ca&s;h in his hands, with
which he is tru&s;ted in the mean time, upon his contract with
his employer, and in reliance on the &s;urety which he has
found to be faithful; &s;o that his obligation is not like that
of a mere hand, for the money received as a &s;pecial <HI>corpus,</HI>
to be made forthcoming in the individual, and which is held
to be already in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his ma&s;ter through him,
but for a ju&s;t account of his receipts in general, to which he
may al&s;o be compelled by a civil action. The Roman law
&s;ays, with re&s;pect to a &s;ituation of this &s;ort, &startq;<HI>Siquis pecu|niam

On this principle went the judgment for arbitrary pain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 26. and Mar. 2. 1705.</NOTE> in
the ca&s;e of Robert Pringle, the teller of a bank, who was
<PB N="68" REF="125">

con&s;iderable amount<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The like judgment was given in England, in the ca&s;e of John Waite, ca&s;hier to the Bank of England, who had ab&s;tracted and &s;old &s;ix Ea&s;t India bonds, the property of the Bank, and entru&s;ted to his keeping. At the Old Bailey, before Mr Baron Reynolds, in February 1743.

See Leach's Ca&s;es in Crown Law; No. 13.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>5. THE ca&s;es which have now been put,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Failure to re|&s;tore Things found.</NOTE> are all &s;uch in
which the offender got the thing by the act and will of
the owner. But it &s;eems to be an equally available de|fence,
if the thing came to him, though again&s;t the owner's
will, in any lawful and warrantable manner, without <HI>tort</HI> or
tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion on his part in the apprehending of it. A land|holder
finds a &s;tray animal in his field, or a trea&s;ure in his
grounds, or has wrecked goods thrown in upon his &s;hore;
or a pa&s;&s;enger finds a pocket-book upon the highway, which
has the owner's name marked in it; or a hackney-coach|man
finds a parcel in his coach, which was left there by
&s;uch a pa&s;&s;enger, whom he &s;ome time before &s;et down. It
&s;eems not to be a theft in any of the&s;e ca&s;es, if the holder,
yielding to the opportunity and temptation, &s;hall hide this
thing, which however does not in any of the&s;e ca&s;es be|long
to him, and keep it to him&s;elf: And for this rea&s;on,
that there was no felonious intention, nor even &s;o much as
a <HI>tre&s;pa&s;s</HI> in the fir&s;t occupying of the thing, which was ly|ing
vacant, and out of the power of the owner, who knew
not where it was, and might lawfully be taken into the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the finder, for the &s;ake of cu&s;tody, or till offer of
a reward.<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">The contrary &s;eems to have been found with re&s;pect to the coachman, in the Engli&s;h ca&s;e of William Wynne; but on principles which probably would not be followed in our practice.

<PB N="69" REF="126">
in the very act of occupying the thing, he could not have been
challenged, nor made liable to any cen&s;ure. In this, there|fore,
as in &s;ome former in&s;tances, the wrong does not enter
deep into the ca&s;e, but con&s;i&s;ts in the failure of &s;ocial duty,
as to the re&s;titution of the thing, or the giving of the due
notices, whereby the owner, or he who hath right, may
come to the knowledge of his property.</P>
<P>IT is no doubt true,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Concealment of Trea&s;ure.</NOTE> that in &s;ome of our antient treati&s;es,
the concealer of a waif is ordered to be dealt with as a
thief, and the <HI>occultatio the&s;auri inventi</HI> is &s;poken of as not on|ly
a theft, but a fort of trea&s;on. But it is obvious that the&s;e
views, (which at any rate no longer govern our practice,
and I know not if they ever did), were not drawn from the
nature of the fact, but are &s;trained and artificial notions,
which were taken up for the more effectual protection of the
Crown's intere&s;t, in the&s;e articles &s;o peculiarly expo&s;ed to
inva&s;ion, and hardly po&s;&s;ible to be thoroughly defended<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">In a li&s;t of ca&s;es tried before the Magi&s;trates of Edinburgh, and &s;ubjoined to the information again&s;t Ludovick Campbell, in January 1730, I find the trial of Bailie Roger Hogg, for hidden trea&s;ure found in an old land in the town, 16th April 1724. This is the only ve&s;tige I have found of any charge of this fort.</NOTE></P>
<P>IN all &s;ituations of this kind, it is however e&s;&s;ential, that
the thing, at the time of taking it, have in a full and proper
&s;en&s;e been out of the owner's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. For, if I &s;ee my
neighbour's &s;heep break through our common fence, and
mingle with my flock, and I in&s;tantly drive off the flock to
another quarter of the country, and efface my neighbour's
mark, this &s;eems to be nothing le&s;s than theft. Though in
my field for the in&s;tant, the &s;heep are not in any proper &s;en&s;e
out of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my neighbour: It is rather to
he held that I for the fir&s;t time take them out of it, when I
<PB N="70" REF="127">
drive off the flock, &s;o as to remove them out of his probable
recovery. It might be more difficult, if the &s;tray &s;heep &s;hould
remain for many days among mine unob&s;erved, and be there
tended in my pa&s;tures along with mine, becau&s;e I &s;hould here
be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, not only without any wrong on my part, but
even without my own knowledge.</P>
<P>THUS far in illu&s;tration of that &s;ide of the que&s;tion which
is favourable to the pannel. It is no le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to guard
our rule on the other part, and to point out tho&s;e &s;ituations,
in which the wrong will, in the e&s;timation of law, amount
to theft, notwith&s;tanding circum&s;tances, which at fir&s;t might
&s;eem to lead to a milder con&s;truction.</P>
<P>1. IT is not to be under&s;tood that the offence cea&s;es to
be theft,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is Theft, though thing expo&s;ed to the Thief.</NOTE> becau&s;e the owner has expo&s;ed the thing to a
ri&s;k of being &s;tolen, and in this &s;en&s;e has put it under the
offender's power; for this may very well happen, and
yet the offender may not, in any proper &s;en&s;e, have been
made keeper of the thing, even for the time; not to men|tion
that it were very dangerous to put property out of the
protection of the law in &s;ituations of this &s;ort, which are
frequent and unavoidable in the daily intercour&s;e and bu&s;i|ne&s;s
of life. A &s;hopkeeper produces his goods to one who
enquires for them, as if to buy, and the pretended cu&s;tomer
runs off with them, as &s;oon as they are put into his hands;
or a per&s;on gallops off with a hor&s;e, which he has got upon
in public market, under the pretence of trying his paces; or
under pretence of giving change for a bank-note to one
who a&s;ks for it in public market, a cheat gets the note into his
hand, and in&s;tantly runs off. It &s;eems to be very plain, that
in any of the&s;e ca&s;es, the crime is theft. For in no one of
them does the owner repo&s;e any voluntary or proper tru&s;t
in the &s;tranger, or mean to venture his property for any
<PB N="71" REF="128">
time, how &s;hort &s;oever, out of his own immediate care and
per&s;onal keeping; in which it &s;till continues to be, though
put into the hand of another, under the owner's eye. And
as little doubt will there be of his ca&s;e, who pockets the
&s;poons at an ordinary where he dines, or takes off and packs
up the &s;heets from the bed of a chamber where he has lain;
for in either ca&s;e he has only the &s;pecial u&s;e of that thing:
The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the care and charge of it, are with the ma|&s;ter
of the hou&s;e, under who&s;e keeping and protection it has
con&s;tantly remained.</P>
<P>2. IT &s;eems likewi&s;e to be the better opinion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cu&s;todiar of a Thing, can he &s;teal it.</NOTE> that the
&s;ame &s;hall hold of tho&s;e very frequent and ordinary &s;itua|tions,
where, though in &s;ome &s;en&s;e a tru&s;t is given, that is
as far as relates to the care and cu&s;tody of the thing for
particular u&s;es, yet the con&s;tructive po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it in the
opinion of law is with the owner, and not with the imme|diate
keeper, who only holds it as a hand, in the name,
and for behoof, of his employer. Such is the ca&s;e of the
butler &s;tealing the plate, or the groom &s;tealing the hor&s;es,
or the &s;hepherd the &s;heep, which are entru&s;ted to his keep|ing.
The &s;ervant has not in any of the&s;e ca&s;es any &s;ort of
property or intere&s;t in the thing, or any power of di&s;po&s;al
or admini&s;tration of it, (as a factor or over&s;eer hath), but
only the naked cu&s;tody and detention of it in a &s;tate of ac|ce&s;&s;ibility
to the ma&s;ter, who can arrange the keeping of it
for his own u&s;es in no other way, and out of which &s;tate,
thus natural to the thing, when the &s;ervant removes it; it is
therefore a proper <HI>taking</HI> from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ma&s;ter;
that is, a theft. By the ma&s;ter's commitment of it to the
&s;ervant, there was no change of lawful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, no alte|ration
nor decrea&s;e of his full command of the thing, in &s;o
<PB N="72" REF="129">
much that it could not be arre&s;ted in the &s;ervant's hands
for the ma&s;ter's debt; and as in ca&s;e of its being ab&s;tracted
from the &s;ervant by any &s;tranger, it would neverthele&s;s be
held to be taken out of the ma&s;ter's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, who alone
could &s;ue for recovery of it, &s;o mu&s;t the &s;ame be held when
the &s;ervant him&s;elf removes it, or is art and part with &s;tran|gers,
who do &s;o.</P>
<P>THE contrary doctrine was &s;trenuou&s;ly urged in the ca&s;e
of Margaret Heart&s;ide,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May 31. June 1. Aug. 10. 1608.</NOTE> an attendant of the Queen, who was
charged with the theft of &s;undry jewels, her Maje&s;ty's pro|perty,
and of con&s;iderable value, of which &s;he had the keep|ing.
But the Court repelled her defences, and &s;ent the libel
as it &s;tood, bearing a charge of theft only, to an a&s;&s;ize<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">&startq;The ju&s;tice, with the advice of his a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, finds the lybel and dittay re|levant, nochtwith&s;tanding of the haill exceptions proponit be the pannell; quairu pon my Lord Advocate a&s;kit in&s;truments.&endq;</NOTE>.
It is true, that though un&s;ucce&s;sful with the Court, this plea
prevailed with the jury, who acquitted her of the theft, and
found her only guilty &startq;of the unlawful and undutiful &s;ub|&s;tracting
and detaining:&endq; But in matter of law the opi|nion
of the Court is more to be regarded. She had &s;entence,
as was not unu&s;ual at that time, under authority of a letter
from the King, which indirectly blames the a&s;&s;ize for ac|quitting
of the theft, and bears, that his Maje&s;ty &startq;accounts
her fact as infamous as if it had been done by direct
&s;tealth,&endq; and therefore bani&s;hes her to the i&s;les of Ork|ney,
for her lifetime. It appears, however, that &s;he was
recalled in 1619, reponed again&s;t the &s;entence of infamy,
and rein&s;tated in her place.</P>
<P>3. IF this doctrine be ju&s;t of &s;uch &s;ituations as the&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;e of Servant or Clerk, &s;teal|ing Things &s;ent by him.</NOTE> in
which the offender has the con&s;tant care and charge of the
particular thing which he has carried off, much more mu&s;t
<PB N="73" REF="130">
the &s;ame hold good, if he has the thing only by an occa|&s;ional
employment, or on a &s;pecial and in&s;tant errand; as
in the ca&s;e of a porter at the po&s;t-office, who receives a let|ter,
with money inclo&s;ed, to be delivered according to the
addre&s;s; or the ca&s;e of a banker's clerk, who is &s;ent with a
&s;um of money, to be in&s;tantly paid at &s;uch a hou&s;e; or in
the ca&s;e of any trade&s;man's &s;ervant, who is &s;ent with an ar|ticle,
to be delivered to a cu&s;tomer. It &s;eems to be at lea&s;t
equally true in all the&s;e &s;ituations, as in any of the former,
that the pre&s;ent holder of the thing has no manner of inte|re&s;t
in it, and is to be regarded only as the in&s;trument of
his employer, in who&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion the article remains until
&s;uch time as it be delivered to the u&s;e whereto he hath &s;ent
it, in like manner as if it were only &s;ent from one apartment
of the office or counting hou&s;e to another. More e&s;pecially,
in the fir&s;t of the&s;e ca&s;es, the porter hath no &s;ort of con|cern
with the <HI>money,</HI> but a charge only over the <HI>letter,</HI> duly
to deliver it. And it is no le&s;s clear with re&s;pect to the
banker's clerk, that his ma&s;ter may countermand him, and
alter the de&s;tination of the money at plea&s;ure, as long as it
is in the hands of the clerk.</P>
<P>OUR practice, accordingly, though it cannot be &s;aid to
have attained to the &s;ame certainty in this department as
that of England, where &s;uch que&s;tions have been &s;ettled by

relevancy was found upon the charge as laid; and

to door, a&s;king employment as a bleacher, and getting linen
to be bleached and returned, and &s;hewing a fal&s;e letter of
recommendation, when in truth he is not, nor ever was a
per&s;on of that trade; and having got the linen, he in&s;tantly
packs it up, and flies. Is the offender here guilty of theft,
or only of fraud?</P>
<P>IT is to be ob&s;erved of &s;uch &s;ituations, that they differ in
&s;everal re&s;pects from tho&s;e, &s;eemingly analogous ca&s;es, which
were formerly con&s;idered. Fir&s;t, the thing is not obtained
upon a contract of &s;ale, or other habile title for the convey|ance
of <HI>property,</HI> but upon a lower and limited title, under
which, if it were even fair and unexceptionable, the holder
would not have any right to di&s;po&s;e of the thing, nor to turn
the value of it into his own pocket. So far from it, that even
on this &s;uppo&s;ition, any &s;tranger who &s;hould <HI>bona fide</HI> buy,
pay for and receive this thing from the holder, would not
thereby make it his own, but would be liable, in like man|ner
as his author, to the owner's real action for recovery of
his property. When the holder a&s;&s;umes any &s;uch power of do|minion,
it is therefore an unwarrantable and ab&s;olutely vici|ous
conver&s;ion of the thing to his own u&s;e, wherein he has
not the colour of a title, and is in truth guilty of a double
wrong, having gained the very cu&s;tody of the thing by
a trick, and arrogating the di&s;po&s;al to him&s;elf, without the
appearance even of the owner's will. Whereas in the ca&s;e
of a &s;windling purcha&s;e upon credit, the holder has obtained
&s;uch a title, by which the property of the thing in the mean
time pa&s;&s;eth, and in u&s;ing, &s;elling, or even de&s;troying the
<PB N="77" REF="136">
thing, he does no more than exerci&s;e the powers appendant
to that title; &s;o that the wrong in this ca&s;e does not lie in
the after conver&s;ion of the commodity to his own u&s;es,
without con&s;ent of the la&s;t owner, but in the fal&s;e in|ducements
by which that con&s;ent was gained.</P>
<P>AGAIN;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;e of Thing hired with intent to take away.</NOTE> in this, the &s;ituation is different from that of a
&s;windling purcha&s;e, that the &s;eller has the means of ab&s;olute|ly
&s;ecuring his intere&s;t if he plea&s;e. He may either &s;ell for
credit or for ready money, and if he &s;ell for credit, it is out of
a voluntary tru&s;t, which he repo&s;es in his cu&s;tomer, where|by
he hath the le&s;s rea&s;on of complaint if he &s;hall be decei|ved,
and can only expect tho&s;e remedies which are &s;uitable
to a breach of tru&s;t. But, in the ca&s;es which are now in
hand, the owner hath no &s;uch choice nor means of ab&s;olute
&s;ecurity, but mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily deal as he has done. This ri&s;k
of the property which is parted with in hire, or to be worked
upon, or the like, is concomitant of the very nature of the&s;e
u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary contracts, and cannot be &s;eparated from
them; &s;o that the more nece&s;&s;ary it is, (and this con&s;idera|tion
never is indifferent in criminal matters), that a &s;ufficient
protection be provided in the pains which the law denounces
again&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>FATHER; there is this very material, and withal obvious
di&s;tinction, between the &s;ituations of hiring and the like, now
and formerly imagined, that the felonious purpo&s;e is now
&s;uppo&s;ed to be coeval with the very act of receiving the thing,
and to be that which alone has &s;ugge&s;ted to the pannnel to
a&s;k it of the owner; whereas we had formerly put the ca&s;e
thus, that the thing was at fir&s;t obtained upon a ju&s;t and
<HI>bona fide</HI> contract of hiring and &s;o forth, and with a true in|tention
on the part of the pannel, as at that time, to re&s;tore it
<PB N="78" REF="137">
according to promi&s;e. By the delivery, therefore, made in
pur&s;uance of &s;uch contract, the owner's lawful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
cea&s;ed and determined, and the abu&s;e of the tru&s;t afterwards,
though criminal, cannot, however, amount to theft in the re|ceiver
of the thing, &s;ince before the conception of any wrong
purpo&s;e, the thing had already pa&s;&s;ed into his power and en|tire
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, by a lawful taking. On the contrary, with
re&s;pect to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, in which there is truly no con|tract
or <HI>con&s;en&s;us in idem placitum</HI> between the parties at all,
but a purpo&s;e of letting to hire in the one party, and a pur|po&s;e
to appropriate without payment, or an <HI>animus furandi</HI> in
the other, which exi&s;ts at the moment of getting the thing, and
is the one original motive of the whole tran&s;action, the ju&s;t
and natural con&s;truction rather &s;eems to be, that the owner's
lawful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion remains unaltered notwith&s;tanding this de|livery,
thus proceeding on the receiver's felonious purpo&s;e;
and that his conver&s;ion of the thing to his own u&s;es is there|fore
to be deemed a theft or <HI>tortious taking</HI> from the lawful
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the owner, in like manner as in the ca&s;e of a
&s;ervant, who runs off with his ma&s;ter's goods. This re&s;ult
too is not more agreeable to principles of law, than to
the natural feeling which one has with re&s;pect to the de|gree
of the offence; for certainly on &s;uch an occa&s;ion
the very &s;ame villany is pa&s;&s;ing in the offender's thoughts
as in tho&s;e of the thief, and the a&s;&s;urance, depravity, and
deliberate contrivance of &s;uch a device, by which the owner
is made the in&s;trument of his own injury, is nowi&s;e infe|rior
to that of an ab&s;traction without his knowledge.</P>
<P>YET I &s;hall not affirm that this is the law of Scotland:
Becau&s;e I have found but one ca&s;e, in which this important
que&s;tion can be &s;aid to have been the &s;ubject of trial; I
mean the ca&s;e of John Mar&s;hall, tried at Dumfries, before
<PB N="79" REF="138">
Lord Hailes on the 26th April 1792. This man had hi|red
a hor&s;e at Sanquhar, to ride to Leadhills, a di&s;tance of
about ten miles, and return in the cour&s;e of the &s;ame day.
In&s;tead of which he rode directly to Edinburgh as fa&s;t as
the hor&s;e could go, and there &s;old it for his own behoof.
The charge in the libel was alternative, for fraud and
cheating, as well as theft. But the Judge delivered his opi|nion,
that upon the fact as related in the libel, the offence
was theft; and the pro&s;ecutor in con&s;equence, wi&s;hing to
avoid a capital conviction, found it nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;trict the
libel to an arbitrary pain. The man was convicted, and
adjudged to be tran&s;ported for &s;even years.</P>
<P>THUS much of the taking which is e&s;&s;ential to the crime of
theft. Upon the whole of which enquiry, before I entirely
di&s;mi&s;s it, it is proper to remark, that our practice has not
yet attained to &s;ufficient maturity, and that a great part of
what has been advanced, is not to be con&s;idered as the re|&s;ult
of our adjudged ca&s;es, and other authorities, which are
few in number, but rather as an expo&s;ition of doctrines
which &s;eem to be rea&s;onable in them&s;elves, and are in &s;ome
particulars recommended by the practice of England<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Judgment was given to that effect in the&s;e ca&s;es; John Tunnard, October 1729; George Charlewood, February 1786; John Pears, September 1779; all of them ca&s;es of a hor&s;e feloniou&s;ly hired and &s;old, and upon the la&s;t of which, the opinion of the twelve Judges was taken, and was unanimous.

<P>II. THERE mu&s;t not only be a taking of the thing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Theft with|out carrying away.</NOTE> but a
carrying away. For it &s;eems to be in the nature of this
offence, (and any greater latitude of con&s;truction would
lead to controver&s;y without end), that the thing have been
brought into a &s;ituation, in which it was le&s;s under the own|er's
power and command than before. In general it is the
meaning of the rule, that the thing mu&s;t be removed from
the place and &s;tate of keeping in which it had been, and that
without &s;uch an alteration, nothing done by the pannel, how
deci&s;ive &s;oever of his felonious purpo&s;e, will amount to theft,
but to an attempt or mi&s;demeanour only, which may be
greater or le&s;s, according to the circum&s;tances of the fact.
A boy has his hand in my pocket, and has got hold of my
pur&s;e; but there I &s;eize his hand, &s;o that the pur&s;e is never

is it theft, if a vagabond pa&s;&s;ing make a &s;natch at linen on
the hedge, and it is held again&s;t him by the thorns; or hav|ing
got into a waggon with intent to &s;teal, if he rai&s;e a pack|age
up, and &s;et it on its end, but without removing it from
the place of the waggon where it had lain, and is there
caught, when about to cut the cords<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>This was found by the twelve Judges of England, to be no &s;ufficient a&s;por|tation, p. 204. Leach's Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>A difficulty of this &s;ort had been found in drawing the libel again&s;t Andrew Macewan, 10th Augu&s;t 1774. It related that two per&s;ons had entered a hou&s;e in the day time, and made their way to a room where linens were lying on a bed. One of them had handed a &s;hirt to his a&s;&s;ociate, and had laid hold of others, which, upon interruption, he was &s;een to throw back upon the bed; &s;o that only one was <HI>taken,</HI> and that one neither concealed nor carried out of the room. The charge was therefore laid alternatively as for theft, or the entering of the hou&s;es of the lieges, <HI>with intention</HI> to &s;teal, or the felonious taking of a &s;hirt or &s;hirts, or other goods their property. The pannel was tran&s;ported on his own petition.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="140">
IT is not however by any means to be under&s;tood, that
there is no theft, unle&s;s the thing be carried clear away,
out of the &s;ight or knowledge of the owner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What a &s;ufficient carrying away.</NOTE> &s;o that he
knows not where to find it. Though the rhief be &s;een in
the very act of taking the thing, and be in&s;tantly and clo&s;e|ly
pur&s;ued, &s;o that the owner has all along been in the near
pro&s;pect of recovering his property, the offence mu&s;t never|thele&s;s
be theft, for this very rea&s;on, that he has had the
thing to pur&s;ue for and recover.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 15. 1686.</NOTE> Thus, in the ca&s;e of Smith
and Forre&s;ter, this charge, among others, was found rele|vant,

In that of Samuel Riccards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 27. and June 19, 20. 27. 1710.</NOTE> it was in like manner found
a good charge of robbery, (which is only a mode of
theft in the larger &s;en&s;e of the word), that he had run off
with a woman's plaid from her &s;houlders, which, on her
outcry, and a hot pur&s;uit, he threw from him in the fields,
where it was in&s;tantly taken up by tho&s;e who were upon his
foot&s;teps.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH there be but a very &s;light removal in re&s;pect
of place, it will al&s;o in every in&s;tance be a theft, if the
thing is thereby lo&s;t to the owner, &s;o that he has to &s;eek
<PB N="82" REF="141">
for and knows not where to find it, or in ca&s;e of mi&s;&s;ing it,
would be under that nece&s;&s;ity: For, how &s;hort &s;oever the
time that this &s;ituation endures, it is quite a new and di&s;tinct
&s;ituation of the property and per&s;on, from that which they
were in before. Thus it will be theft in a &s;ervant to take
his ma&s;ter's pur&s;e from the table, or to unhook his watch
from the bed, though he be caught with it before he leave
the room, if it be found concealed in his clothes, or about
his per&s;on, in &s;uch a manner as proves his felonious inten|tion.
As it would al&s;o be for any gue&s;t in an inn or ta|vern,
to &s;ecret any piece of plate, linen, or the like, belong|ing
to the hou&s;e, in his che&s;t, with intent to carry it away.</P>
<P>THERE &s;eems to be as little doubt of this general direc|tion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What a &s;ufficient carrying away.</NOTE>
that it is always theft, if the thing is taken on of its
natural and proper place of keeping; not the place where it
accidentally happens to be, but that where for &s;ecurity
it had been put. Thus the crime is complete, as &s;oon as
the hor&s;e is carried out of the &s;table, or the cattle out of
the inclo&s;ure, though the thief be &s;topped in the &s;table-yard
in the one ca&s;e, or in the next field, being part of the &s;ame
farm, in the other. Accordingly, in the interlocutor of re|levancy
in the ca&s;e of William Baillie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 7. 1714.</NOTE> the Court &startq;<HI>&s;eparatim</HI>
find, That the goods libelled being &s;tolen out of the &s;aid

two &s;heep over the wall of the field, where they had been
at pa&s;ture, and had &s;laughtered and flead them behind the
wall, and was there taken, before removal of his booty.
<PB N="83" REF="142">
The &s;laughter was indeed a &s;trong circum&s;tance, taken along
with the others in the ca&s;e; but if it had taken place with|in
the field, would not of it&s;elf have grounded the charge
of theft, &s;ince it might have been done out of malice, and
without any purpo&s;e to carry off the carca&s;e.</P>
<P>FOR the &s;ame rea&s;on which makes a removal from the
<HI>tenement</HI> &s;ufficient in the&s;e ca&s;es, it is no le&s;s &s;ufficient with
re&s;pect to any thing which has a peculiar and &s;afe place of
keeping within the hou&s;e, if it be once taken from thence,
with intent to carry it away. Under this rule my &s;ervant
is guilty of theft, when he takes money out of my bureau,
and the gue&s;t in an inn, when he forces the lock of any re|po&s;itory
in his chamber, and takes out the contents, or one
who has entered a hou&s;e, when he breaks up a che&s;t, cup|board,

THE &s;ame principle equally applies to the &s;tealing of &s;uch
things are kept in a certain manner about the per&s;on;<NOTE PLACE="marg">What a &s;ufficient carrying away.</NOTE> where|by
it is theft if the pur&s;e be taken out of the pocket, or the
watch drawn from the fob, or the ear-ring torn from the
ear<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">A &s;ingular ca&s;e of this &s;ort was tried at the Old Bailey in May 1784. James Lapier had taken his &s;tand at the door of the Opera-hou&s;e, and &s;eeing a lady, Mrs Hobart, pa&s;&s;ing to her carriage, he made a violent attempt to pull away a valuable ear-ring from her ear. The ear was torn through, and the ear-ring completely &s;e|parated from it, and the lady cried out that the man had got it; and he was taken. On going home, however, and at undre&s;&s;ing, the ear-ring was found entangled in the curls of her hair. Neverthele&s;s, as it had been violently forced from its due &s;tate of fa&s;tening to the per&s;on, and was for a time mi&s;&s;ing, the twelve Judges were of opinion, that his conviction of robbery was legal and good.&mdash;In like manner, at the Old Bailey, in February 1782, Henry Collet was convicted of larceny, having entered a waggon, and removed a parcel from the fore part of the waggon to the tail of it, where he was &s;topped, and threw back the parcel to the middle part of the waggon. Leach's Ca&s;es, No. 139. No. 108.</NOTE>. And in general it &s;eems to be true, that if the &s;tate of
fixture in which the thing is by nature be altered, or if the
peculiar provi&s;ions, what&s;oever, which the owner has made
for the &s;afe-keeping of the thing, be once overcome, this,
joined with any the lea&s;t removal of it in re&s;pect of place,
con&s;ummates the guilt. Hence it may &s;eem that there is
ground for the charge, if wool be plucked from the &s;heep, or
fruit from the tree, or if a &s;trong che&s;t, which is fa&s;tened to
the floor, be un&s;crewed, and lifted ever &s;o little out of its
place; or if a piece of cloth in a bleachfield is unpinned
from the ground, and rolled into a bale, which the thief has
taken up under his arm; or if he cut a web out of the loom
and fold it, or take a per&s;on's breeches with his money from
<PB N="85" REF="144">
under his pillow, as he &s;leeps, and be making off with them
out of the room. And even with re&s;pect to articles of that
nature, for which no &s;uch peculiar provi&s;ion has been made,
any removal will be &s;ufficient, that thoroughly alters the &s;i|tuation
in which the thing was left or happened to be, and is a
plain &s;tep in the conveyance of it out of the owner's power;
as if any loo&s;e article in a hou&s;e is carried down from a
higher floor to a lower, or if a hor&s;e is taken in an open com|mon,
and is haltered and mounted, and ridden away from
among the other cattle.</P>
<P>III. THE taking and carrying away mu&s;t be with a felo|nious
purpo&s;e;<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Theft with|out felonious In|tent.</NOTE> in the knowledge that the thing belongs to
a neighbour, and with intent to deprive him of his proper|ty.
Hence, on the one hand, it is not theft, to take away
the property of another, though in the knowledge that it
is &s;o, if the takers object is only irregular and improper,
and not to make the thing his own. It is an example of
this, that a &s;ervant rides his ma&s;ter's hor&s;e under night, up|on
his own errand; or that a per&s;on finding his neighbour's
plough lying in the field, openly u&s;es it to till his own lands
adjacent; or that he drives his neighbour's cattle into his
own field under night, in order to poind them, upon pretence
of tre&s;pa&s;s. On the other hand, neither will it be theft,
though the taker mean to di&s;po&s;e of the thing as his own,
if he take it in the belief, no matter though erroneous, if
&s;erious, and withal excu&s;able, that the thing is his own;
as may happen in many ca&s;es of di&s;puted &s;ale, legal dili|gence,
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and other modes of conveyance. If John
carry off the goods of James by poinding, be the diligence
ever &s;o irregular, nay, though John's proceedings be even
in&s;idious and oppre&s;&s;ive, &s;till the taking in this form can
<PB N="86" REF="145">
never amount to theft or &s;touthrief, or other capital deno|mination
of crime, but only to a &s;puilzie or oppre&s;&s;ion,
which may be puni&s;hable at the di&s;cretion of the Court.

the proud and contentious &s;pirit of the inhabitants of Scot|land
formerly gave occa&s;ion, not one &s;eems to have been
brought to a favourable i&s;&s;ue, nor even to have had a clear
relevancy of capital pain pronounced on it. The ordinary
cour&s;e in &s;uch ca&s;es was to continue the diet, till the ci|vil

<P>A CONTROVERSY had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between Trotter of Mor|tonhall
and Rigg of Morton, re&s;pecting the property of cer|tain
parcels of ground. Rigg had ca&s;t the turf upon the&s;e
plots, and was proceeding to lay it on his bowling-green, in
which operation he was violently di&s;turbed by a <HI>po&s;&s;e</HI> under
the orders of Trotter. This incident gave ri&s;e to mutual pro|&s;ecutions;
<PB N="87" REF="146">
again&s;t Rigg for theft and robbery, in cutting
and carrying off the turf from Trotter's lands; again&s;t
Trotter for robbery, oppre&s;&s;ion, haime-&s;ucken, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in de|&s;troying
Rigg's turf and bowling-green, tearing up the
new-turf in the green, (or <HI>green &s;pecificate,</HI> as it is called),
and troubling and beating his &s;ervants. The former was
found not relevant to infer any criminal conclu&s;ion; the
other was &s;u&s;tained,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 8. and 15. 1714.</NOTE> as for a riotous mole&s;tation and outrage
only, to infer arbitrary pain, damages and expences.</P>
<P>MUCH a-kin to this, were the mutual pro&s;ecutions for
robbery, theft and &s;touthrief,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 2. and 9. 1713.</NOTE> between Sir William and Ludo|vick
Gordon. Which were upon no higher ground than
this, that having met to &s;ettle accounts, they had quarrelled
upon the matter, and in a &s;ort of &s;cuffle, had each laid hold of
the writings belonging to the other. Both parties found it ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to depart from the&s;e high conclu&s;ions; and the jury
found neither of the libels proven. Many examples more
of the &s;ame completion might be given.</P>
<P>IT has been &s;aid, and is fit to be remarked, that it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary
the pannel be excu&s;able for believing that the thing
which he has taken is his own. For as to that &s;ort of belief,
if &s;uch it may be called, which is directly in the face of
law, and only comes of the violent pa&s;&s;ions of the man, or
his blind prejudices in his own favour, it is what the Judge
can have no con&s;ideration of, nor any of the lieges be al|lowed
to entertain. A &s;muggler, therefore, if he break in|to
the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, and take away goods, which have been
&s;eized from him and condemned, is as much guilty of theft
and hou&s;e-breaking, as if he broke into the hou&s;e and took
away the goods of his neighbour.</P>
<P>IV. IT is &s;aid to be another qualification of the taking
and carrying away,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mu&s;t the taking be for lucre.</NOTE> that it is for the &s;ake of lucre, and profit.
<PB N="88" REF="147">
But this article will require to be guarded and explained.
It is true, in the &s;en&s;e already explained, <HI>viz.</HI> that the thing
mu&s;t be taken away with the purpo&s;e to detain it from the
owner. It is al&s;o true in this other &s;en&s;e, that libel will not
lie for theft, if, out of malice to the owner, the property is
de&s;troyed in the place where it is &s;eized, without being re|moved;
which happens when a man's cattle are &s;laughtered
and left upon the &s;pot in the field, or when a mob enter a
man's hou&s;e, and break and deface his effects, without car|rying
any article away. But it may require to be con&s;i|dered,
in the ca&s;e of the property being once removed into
the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the offender, whether it alters the de|&s;cription
of the offence, that in&s;tead of being u&s;ed or turned
to profit, the thing is afterwards de&s;troyed, and that this
indulgence of &s;pite was even the fir&s;t inducement to take the
thing away. In its own nature, the crime of theft &s;eems to be
complete by the removal, and the thorough alteration of the
&s;tate of command over the thing, if this be made with the
purpo&s;e of never re&s;toring it to the owner. Be the offen|der's
object what it may, he is actually <HI>locupletior,</HI> and the
owner poorer, <HI>eo ip&s;o,</HI> that he has the thing under his power, to
di&s;po&s;e of as he plea&s;es: And if he coveted that power for
the &s;ake of revenge, this neither hinders the taking away to
be &s;uch, nor even in any proper &s;en&s;e to be a taking for the
&s;ake of lucre; &s;ince this gratification of his evil pa&s;&s;ions, is
to him a lucre and gain. He &s;till has &s;ought an advantage
to him&s;elf, and &s;ought it by removing his neigbour's proper|ty
out of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his neighbour into his own. Ha|ving
&s;ecured this advantage, he may either per&s;i&s;t in his
original purpo&s;e of mi&s;chief, or change it for one of u&s;e and
profit, if he &s;hall be &s;o inclined: He has now the very &s;ame
di&s;cretion in that re&s;pect by his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which the owner
<PB N="89" REF="148">
formerly enjoyed by the &s;ame means. In ca&s;e, therefore,
(if &s;uch a thing &s;hould happen), of a herd of cattle being
driven from the owner's lands to tho&s;e of his enemy at a
di&s;tance, and only &s;laughtered when there &s;ettled in the cu|&s;tody
of his enemy, the charge of theft may &s;eem to lie;
for it would have lain if he had been pur&s;ued and taken
on his way; and it is hardly to be thought that this can be
altered by any after event. The criterion, therefore, in
this que&s;tion, rather lies in the want of removal of the
thing.</P>
<P>BUT however this may be,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Animus Lucri</HI> explained.</NOTE> it is certain, that in the ordi|nary
ca&s;e, the <HI>animus lucri</HI> is to be pre&s;umed from the act
it&s;elf of taking the thing away. If the offender knew at
the time what it was he took, he was actuated by the de&s;ire
of that thing, and if he knew it not, as happens in pocket|picking,
and in &s;tealing the mail, and if the thing prove to be
&s;uch as can be of no u&s;e to him, all that can be &s;aid is, that
the man has been deceived in his expectations; for take it
he did in the hope of profit, and in the belief that it was
worth having, and making venture of his per&s;on for. No
matter then what afterwards becomes of the thing, or with
what view he keep it, nay, though he do not keep it at all,
but de&s;troy or throw it away, or even fall on &s;ome means
of reconveying it to the owner, the guilt &s;till abideth with
him. The profit only, and not the profligacy of the enter|pri&s;e
is thereby le&s;&s;ened, which la&s;t is determined by that
which is pa&s;&s;ing in the mind of the adventurer at the time
of taking, and not by tho&s;e con&s;iderations, of fear, repen|tance,
or prudence, which may afterwards come to affect
him.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="149">
IT is al&s;o to be under&s;tood, that if the thing be kept by
the taker,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Animus Lucri</HI> explained.</NOTE> it matters not what the motive of the keeping is,
whether merely to hoard, or with a view to con&s;ume the
thing, or what other advantage, real or conceived. Eve|ry
object is <HI>lucre</HI> in the e&s;timation of law, which tempts
a per&s;on to de&s;ire the <HI>keeping</HI> and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that which is
another's; though the thing is not of that nature to yield,
or be convertible to, pecuniary profit. If a criminal pur|loin
from the Sheriff-clerk or Procurator fi&s;cal, the docu|ments
and evidences either of his own guilt or that of an
a&s;&s;ociate, &s;urely this is to him a real lucre, and relatively
to the nature and u&s;e of the thing taken, he is as much
actuated by a &s;elfi&s;h and irregular de&s;ire of gain, as he who
&s;teals a bag of money. And probably it will be admitted,
with re&s;pect to a connoi&s;&s;eur, who &s;hould &s;teal pictures or
medals for the plea&s;ure of admiring them, or an anti|quarian,
who &s;hould &s;teal rare books or manu&s;cripts for
his in&s;truction, that neither of them would have a &s;ound
defence in a court of ju&s;tice. We &s;hall afterwards &s;ee,
that we accordingly have precedents of libel &s;u&s;tained
for the &s;tealing of a child; though the <HI>ordinary</HI> incite|ment
to &s;uch a crime, mu&s;t either be love conceived to the
child, or more probably hatred to its relations. In &s;hort,
as various as the plea&s;ures are which a man may have in
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing his own, &s;o various are the &s;orts of lucre, which
the law will hold &s;ufficient in this que&s;tion, if on account of
them one &s;hould covet that which is another's.</P>
<P>V. ACCORDING to &s;ome authorities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mu&s;t the taking be clande&s;tine.</NOTE> it ought al&s;o to be
added to the de&s;cription of the crime, that the taking and
carrying away is &s;ecret and clande&s;tine. And this may be
true, if we under&s;tand a clande&s;tine taking as contradi|&s;tingui&s;hed
<PB N="91" REF="150">
only to a taking by main force, or by putting
in fear. But in any loo&s;er and more general &s;en&s;e, &s;uch as
would exclude all taking by &s;urpri&s;e, or of a &s;udden; as if
a per&s;on &s;natch the hat from a man's head, or his watch
out of his hand, as he is carele&s;sly holding it, or if he dart
into a &s;hop and run off with goods from the counter in pre|&s;ence
of the owner; it does not &s;eem to be a proper part of
the de&s;cription of the crime, which in all the&s;e in&s;tances
&s;eems rather to be theft than any thing el&s;e. For neither
is there any application here to the will of the owner, to
over-awe him, nor any compul&s;ion by an overpowering
force, which &s;eem to be the characters of robbery, but a
taking in &s;uch a way, which equally &s;ets a&s;ide the owner's
will in the matter, as the mo&s;t clande&s;tine ab&s;traction; &s;ince
the thing is gone, before he can u&s;e any means to detain it.
If, however, any &s;ort of &s;truggle en&s;ues on the attempt, and
the purpo&s;e is only accompli&s;hed by violence or terror, the
ca&s;e becomes then a ca&s;e of robbery, notwith&s;tanding the
fir&s;t intention to take by &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>VI. WE are now come to the la&s;t article in the de&s;crip|tion
of this crime;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thing taken mu&s;t be <HI>Res aliena.</HI></NOTE> which is that the thing taken be the
property of another: For I &s;ee no authority in our prac|tice
to per&s;uade me, that a per&s;on can in any ca&s;e be
guilty of theft, though he may of &s;ome inferior wrong, by
irregularly taking that which is his own. It is not, how|ever,
any hinderance of the charge of theft, that the pro|perty
of the thing taken is uncertain or unknown, &s;uch as
the goods of a decea&s;ed, goods pa&s;&s;ing on commi&s;&s;ion, or a
waif or &s;tray that is &s;tolen from the finder. Indeed, a cer|tain
latitude in this re&s;pect is indi&s;pen&s;ible to ju&s;tice, in
the extended &s;tate of commerce and manifold tran&s;action
<PB N="92" REF="151">
among men, which offers &s;o many &s;ituations of this ambi|guous
character, but in which there is neverthele&s;s no rea|&s;on,
why the thing &s;hould be out of the ordinary protection
of the law. Hence, though any libel at a private in&s;tance
mu&s;t &s;et forth the pur&s;uer's intere&s;t in the thing, and though
in all ca&s;es where it can conveniently be done, the property
is in u&s;e to be &s;et forth, for the pannel's full information of
the nature of the charge again&s;t him, yet in indictment for
the public intere&s;t, when&s;oever there is any rea&s;on for it, it
will be &s;ufficient that the charge is made in &s;uch a manner,
as &s;hows that the thing did not belong to the pannel, neither
really nor by preten&s;ion, and that neither was it lying unoc|cupied,
but in a &s;tate of lawful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, for behoof of the
per&s;on who then had, or &s;hould afterwards acquire, a right
to it. Nor is there any &s;ort of hard&s;hip here on the pannel,
who has it equally in his power under this, as any other
form of charge, to prove that the things are his own proper|ty,
or that of others, by who&s;e authority he took them; a proof
which it always lies on him the pannel to bring forward.</P>
<P>THE charge again&s;t Wil&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 2. 1736.</NOTE> Hall and Robert&s;on was,
that they had carried off &startq;bank-notes in a pocket-book be|longing

the property of Alexander Macdougall, <HI>or of &s;ome other per|&s;on,
to the pro&s;ecutor unknown.&endq;</HI> The charge was &s;u&s;tained
<PB N="93" REF="152">
in all the&s;e in&s;tances, and in the la&s;t after exception taken
to it by the pannel.</P>
<P>IT is almo&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary to remark,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Res univer&s;itatis</HI> may be &s;tolen.</NOTE> that the charge of theft
is competent, without regard to the quality of the owner,
whether a private per&s;on, or his Maje&s;ty, a corporation, a
private &s;ociety, a pari&s;h, or what el&s;e, or though the ca&s;e
&s;hould be &s;uch, in which it is difficult to $ix the preci&s;e de|&s;cription
of the owner, or the nature of the immediate inte|re&s;t
in the thing.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 27. 1788.</NOTE> The money taken in Smith and Brodie's
ca&s;e, and in that of Wil&s;on and Hall, was part of the royal
revenue. On the 6th of December 1556, Adam Sinclair and
Henry Elderlous had &s;entence of death for breaking into the
church of Forres, and &s;tealing money, chalices, and church-ornaments.
On 21&s;t May 1602, William Norvall, &s;chool|ma&s;ter
of Cockpen, was bani&s;hed for &s;tealing from the &s;e&s;|&s;ion-hou&s;e,
the poors box of that pari&s;h, containing L. 8 of
the poors money. And in the &s;pring circuit 1750, at Aber|deen,
William Martin had &s;entence of death for the &s;ame
crime, having broken into a church, and &s;tolen L. 11 of the
poors money. We are not &s;ubject, in &s;uch ca&s;es, to the &s;ame
difficulties, which &s;eem to embarra&s;s the Engli&s;h practice in
&s;tating the property, and which, in &s;ome in&s;tances, have
con&s;trained them to feign a property, where in &s;trictne&s;s
there is none, (as in the ca&s;e of a &s;hroud taken out of the
grave, which is feigned to be the property of the relations
of the decea&s;ed), but will more rea&s;onably be content with
&s;uch a de&s;cription of the thing, as makes the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion or
admini&s;tration of it clear, and excludes all title in the pan|nel
to take it away.</P>
<P>VII. THESE &s;eem to be the principal circum&s;tances of the
de&s;cription of the crime of theft.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Theft not pur|ged by re&s;toring thing or vaule.</NOTE> Which having once been
<PB N="94" REF="153">
committed by a proper taking and carrying away, can|not
afterwards be undone in any cour&s;e of conduct, not even
by early and voluntary re&s;titution of the thing &s;tolen, and
much le&s;s by payment of the value, or other atonement in
money. For what the law chiefly con&s;fiders in this matter,
is not &s;o much the damage to the individual, as the viola|tion
of the order of civil &s;ociety, by di&s;hone&s;ty prevailing
over right, and the danger of &s;eduction, by the &s;pectacle of this
as a practicable thing. Witne&s;s, in proof of this, the ca&s;e of
John Wat&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 3. 1663.</NOTE> who had &s;entence of death for &s;tealing forty
&s;heep, notwith&s;tanding his allegation, which does not &s;eem to
be di&s;puted, that he had already refunded &startq;the worth of
them&endq; to the owner. Witne&s;s al&s;o the ca&s;e of Finlay
Macgibbon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 2. and 3. 1669.</NOTE> for the theft of &s;ix hor&s;es, and that of Grizel So|merville,<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>Macgibbon's ca&s;e. &startq;The Ju&s;tice repels the defence proponed for the pan|nell, and finds the dittay relevant, and ordains the &s;ame to pa&s;s,&endq; <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He was accordingly convicted and executed.</P>
<P>Somerville's ca&s;e. &startq;Su&s;tain the dittay as to the haill remanent articles of theft lybelled, relevant, <HI>&s;eparatim,</HI> to infer an arbitrary pain; &hellip; and repell the defence founded on re&s;titution, and remitts.&endq;</P></NOTE>,
in both of which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 5. 1686.</NOTE> the defence of re&s;titution of
the things them&s;elves, and in the former, along with &startq;ten
&s;core merks for the &s;kaith,&endq; was &s;pecially repelled. In
the ca&s;e too of Daniel Mackay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 6. 1781.</NOTE> a letter-carrier, who had
&s;entence of death for &s;tealing L. 300 out of a letter, the whole
&s;um but L. 15 had been returned through the Po&s;t-office, to
the owner. Yet it may plau&s;ibly be maintained, though I
do not know of any judgment to that effect, that the private
party, who not only recovers his property, or the value of
it, (for which he cannot be blamed), but has al&s;o taken
theft-bute from the thief, &s;hall not be allowed to pro&s;ecute;
&s;ince, in the con&s;truction of law, he is in that ca&s;e him&s;elf
participant of the theft. But it is certain, that neither by
<PB N="95" REF="154">
this, nor any other mea&s;ure of his, can he &s;creen the cri|minal
from puni&s;hment, or di&s;appoint the cour&s;e of public
ju&s;tice; of which he hath no di&s;po&s;al.</P>
<P>VIII. Next;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Things whereof Theft may be committed.</NOTE> of the things, whereof theft may be commit|ted.
In the law of England, theft is only of things per&s;o|nal,
and not of things real, or things which appertain to,
or favour of, the realty. Under this rule, there is no theft
with them at common law, of nur&s;ery plants, nor of growing
trees, nor of any of the growing fruits of the ground; nor of
hedge-paling, nor of lead, iron, or other thing united to
a hou&s;e. As al&s;o the writings of any real e&s;tate, are not
&s;ubject of this crime; neither are bonds, bills, or other
cho&s;es in action; though for this a different rea&s;on is gi|ven.
But to all the&s;e, (as we &s;hould e&s;teem them) artificial di|&s;tinctions,
our practice has ever been a &s;tranger, and recog|ni&s;es
the theft of every inanimate thing, which can be &s;e|vered
from that, which either naturally, or by art, it is at|tached
to, and be carried away. Thus, in the ca&s;e of James
Inglis,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 1. 1720.</NOTE> relevancy was found on the tearing of wool from
&s;heep,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 13. 1758.</NOTE> and carrying it away<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Long before this, &s;entence of death had pa&s;&s;ed upon James Gray, convicted of pulling wool from nine ewes, and &s;tealing an ewe, and carrying off the wool which he had pulled; 17th March 1581. MS. Ab&s;. Record, Adv. Libr.</NOTE>. And in that of James Miln,
accu&s;ed of the &s;everal facts of &s;tealing &s;horn grain, &s;hearing
gra&s;s, and carrying it away, and pulling up growing pea&s;e,
and carrying them away, all of which were charged under
the name of theft only, the trial proceeded on that footing
as to the whole articles; and the man was tran&s;ported. It
&s;eems even to be the more probable opinion, according to
the analogy of what is &s;ettled, that the &s;eparating and car|rying
away of part of the &s;ub&s;tance of the tenement it&s;elf,
<PB N="96" REF="155">
&s;hall be judged by the &s;ame rule. It is true, that injuries of
this &s;ort are ordinarily done in that open manner, and are ac|companied
with tho&s;e circum&s;tances, which bear evidence of
a tre&s;pa&s;s only or mole&s;tation; but it &s;eems to be only there
that the di&s;tinction lies. For if one come in the night-time
and work coal in his neighbour's pit, or &s;tone in his quarry,
or feuel in his mo&s;s, and carry it away and hide it, this
&s;eems to be ju&s;t &s;uch an act as the cutting off the leaden
&s;pouts, or tearing up the iron &s;pikes of his hou&s;e, which is
certainly theft.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to writings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is committed of Writings.</NOTE> the law has been &s;ettled again&s;t
the thief, by repeated judgments. As long ago as the 23d
June 1599, Grizel Mathew had &s;entence of death, for &s;teal|ing
a coffer with writs and evidents.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 30. Ap. 1. &amp; 3. &amp; May 2. 1601.</NOTE> Al&s;o James and Wil|liam
Wood, and Alexander Dow, had &s;entence of death, for
breaking into the hou&s;e of Bonnington, and &s;tealing the
whole writs and evidents of that e&s;tate, contained in a coffer,
together with certain articles of furniture, and another
coffer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May 20. 1614.</NOTE> al&s;o containing writs. As had Patrick Eviot, con|victed
of common theft, and of &s;tealing a leather wallet,
whereof the principal contents were certain title-deeds,
which the owner was carrying, to obtain a charter of con|firmation.
On the 6th November 1635, Michael Scott is
&s;ent to an a&s;&s;ize, on a charge of &s;tealing certain bonds of
borrowed money from the owner's che&s;t; but he is acquitted.
Relevancy is found to the &s;ame effect in the&s;e ca&s;es: Again&s;t

the&s;e extremes, there lie a great number of more ambigu|ous
&s;ituations, &s;uch as that of deer in a park, rabbits in a

re&s;pect to which it may not be certain what opinion our
Judges would have held, if the Legi&s;lature had not made
them the &s;ubject of &s;pecial provi&s;ions; which declare that
the taking of the&s;e things, or even the &s;hooting at deer, rabbit
or pigeon, without con&s;ent of the owner, &s;hall be theft. The
chief of the&s;e are the acts 1474, c. 60.; 1535, c. 13.; 1587,
c. 59.; and 1579, c. 84.; which la&s;t declares, that in a per&s;on
who is not re&s;pon&s;ible with his goods, for the pecuniary pains,
the breaking of dovecotes, cunningaires or parks, may be
puni&s;hed with death on the third fault, even by an infe|rior
court. The acts 1535, c. 13. and 1555, c. 58. extend
<PB N="100" REF="159">
the &s;ame pains to the &s;tealing of bee-hives, which indeed
&s;eems to be of the nature of theft at common law. It is
true, that other &s;tatutes may be cited, &s;uch as the acts
1503; c. 69.; 1607, c. 3.; which appoint the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors
in the&s;e &s;everal ways to be puni&s;hed only with pecuniary or
petty corporal pains, at lea&s;t in certain ca&s;es. But notwith|&s;tanding
this &s;ort of variance, of which there are many
other in&s;tances in our &s;tatute-book, the clear re&s;ult of the
whole &s;eems to be the rai&s;ing of the&s;e offences to the rank of
theft, and an authority for inflicting death in ca&s;e of fla|grant
and repeated guilt. Certain it is, that John Raitt and
Alexander Dean had &s;entence of death for breaking into
eight different gardens,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 23. &amp; 25. 1623.</NOTE> and &s;tealing garden-&s;tuffs, and from
&s;ome of them bee-hives; but whether they were convicted
on the&s;e &s;tatutes, or on the common law as incorrigible
thieves, does not appear from the record.</P>
<P>IN the law of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Theft of Things animate.</NOTE> no larceny &s;eems to be acknow|ledged
of animals of a ba&s;e nature, &s;uch as dogs, &s;inging
birds, and other creatures, kept for whim or plea&s;ure. This
may perhaps be more &s;uitable to their &s;y&s;tem, in which the
pains are more definite, and which requires the value of the
thing to be &s;et forth in the indictment, and di&s;tingui&s;hes be|tween
grand and petty larceny according to the amount of
the value, (whereas of &s;uch things there is no determinate
value, great or &s;mall), than it is to ours, where the Judge
has free di&s;cretion to proportion the pains to the whole cir|cum&s;tances,
what&s;oever, of the ca&s;e, and may &s;ix them as low
as he &s;ees good. But on this I have found no precedent.

<P>RIGHTLY con&s;idered, the away-taking and vending, or
&s;ending into captivity, of a per&s;on of grown years and mature
di&s;cretion, &s;eems to be a crime of a di&s;tinct nature from
theft or robbery, and in nowi&s;e a patrimonial, but a proper
per&s;onal injury, and one of the highe&s;t &s;ort. It cannot
fall under the notion of theft, by rea&s;on, if there were no
more in the ca&s;e, of the circum&s;tances of force and inva&s;ion
of the per&s;on, with which it mu&s;t be accompanied. And
even to call it a robbery, &s;eems to be a perver&s;ion, and a
figurative, rather than judicial u&s;e of the term; &s;ince the en|tire
injury of &s;uch an act con&s;i&s;ts in the di&s;tre&s;s and &s;uffering
of the per&s;on him&s;elf who is taken, and not in any damage
to others by the taking of him. It cannot therefore with
any more propriety be called a robbery, than even the mur|der
<PB N="102" REF="161">
of him might be called &s;o, by which his relations, me|taphorically
may be &s;aid to be robbed of their kin&s;man. Ac|cordingly,
I have not found any precedent of capital pain
inflicted for this offence under the notion of theft. The
light in which of old it was &s;ometimes viewed, and even
this &s;eems to be &s;omewhat a &s;trained and artificial notion,
(though it prevailed in England as well as here<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Black&s;t. vol. iv. p, 76.</NOTE>), was that
of a trea&s;onable u&s;urpation of the royal authority, in the de|taining

<P>THE one ca&s;e, therefore, which &s;eems to be referrible to
this part of our &s;ubject, is the away-taking of an infant
child. For in this in&s;tance the creature taken, which has
no will of its own to be forced, is as a <HI>thing</HI> under the care
and in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of others, from whom it is taken, and
to whom, without any violence, it may be &s;aid, and in com|mon
language is &s;aid, to belong, and to whom too the lo&s;s
and di&s;tre&s;s of the taking of it is, which the child it&s;elf does
not feel nor know. Neither is it an objection to this view
of the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, that the child cannot be taken away
<PB N="104" REF="163">
for the &s;ake of profit. For, be&s;ide that the per&s;on of the
child may be, and &s;ometimes is turned to profit in certain
ways, it is lucre in the e&s;timation of law, that the child is
detained and kept. The detainer has therein that advan|tage
and benefit, what&s;oever it was, which he coveted in
taking the child away; and this, when reaped by cu&s;tody
and keeping of the thing, not by in&s;tant de&s;truction of it
without keeping or removal, is all the lucre which the law
requires, and makes the ca&s;e as much a ca&s;e of theft, if the
child were even &s;tolen out of affection to it&s;elf, and much
more if out of enmity to the parents, as if a per&s;on &s;hould &s;teal
a MS. from any one in a language to him&s;elf unknown, in or|der
to di&s;tre&s;s him, or any other article on which he &s;ets
a value, and which is u&s;ele&s;s to any but the owner. Now, if
there be no ob&s;tacle to the conception of the deed as a theft in
this point of view, much le&s;s is there any in the nature of it,
con&s;idered with relation to the wickedne&s;s of the offender, or
the di&s;tre&s;s and mi&s;ery it occa&s;ions to the parents or near re|lations
of the child, both of which are out of all compari|&s;on
greater, that in any other ca&s;e of theft; not to mention
the danger and facility of this inva&s;ion of a creature, which
can make no re&s;i&s;tance. Mackenzie hath accordingly &s;aid,
that with us, Aegyptians and others, &s;tealing children, have
been puni&s;hed with death. And of this there was a late
in&s;tance in the ca&s;e of Margaret Irvine, tried and condem|ned
at Aberdeen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 24. 1784.</NOTE> by the Lords Hailes and Henderland, for

<P>IX. HAVING now gained &s;ome notion of the nature of
theft,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Puni&s;h|ment of Theft.</NOTE> we proceed to con&s;ider the pains which law has ap|pointed
for the tran&s;gre&s;&s;or. In entering upon this article,
much &s;hall not be &s;aid in relation to the controver&s;y, though
keenly agitated, re&s;pecting the ju&s;tice or propriety of <HI>in
any ca&s;e</HI> puni&s;hing a &s;ingle act of theft with death. That
<PB N="106" REF="165">
&s;uch a controver&s;y &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t, may not indeed be won|derful,
con&s;idering how light the owner's lo&s;s in any one in|&s;tance,
when weighed again&s;t the life of a man; and moved
by this humane view of the matter, many eminent lawyers,
among whom Mathaeus and Grotius, have loudly declared
again&s;t what &s;eems to be the almo&s;t univer&s;al practice of
the nations of modern Europe. But that &s;uch is the com|mon
practice of an improved age, and in the mo&s;t enlight|ened
quarter of the globe, &s;eems to afford a &s;trong pre&s;ump|tion,
that there are con&s;iderations of general policy, or ra|ther
of nece&s;&s;ity, on the other &s;ide, (if the peace, pro&s;perity,
and good order of &s;ociety are to be con&s;ulted), which are of
a nature too urgent and powerful, to let this &s;cheme of mercy
be put in practice. And indeed, if we &s;hall not take into
our view this of the character of crimes, with re&s;pect to their
influence on the tranquillity or other great intere&s;ts of &s;o|ciety,
but think of e&s;tabli&s;hing a &s;cale of pains for all of|fences,
in proportion to their wickedne&s;s and natural de|formity,
it will not be in this one article of theft that the
reformation mu&s;t be made, but almo&s;t the whole &s;y&s;tem of
puni&s;hments mu&s;t be new modelled. As Hale<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hale, vol. i. p. 13.</NOTE> has ju&s;tly
remarked, &startq;when offences grow enormous, frequent and
dangerous to a &s;tate or kingdom, de&s;tructive or highly per|nicious
to civil &s;ocieties, and to the great in&s;ecurity and
danger of the kingdom and its inhabitants, &s;evere puni&s;h|ments,
even death it&s;elf, is nece&s;&s;ary to be annexed to
laws in many ca&s;es, by the prudence of lawgivers, though
po&s;&s;ibly beyond the &s;ingle demerit of the offence it&s;elf,
&s;imply con&s;idered.&endq; It is true, that entirely to &s;uppre&s;s
the evil, is not to be expected of this, nor of any other cour&s;e
of treatment; but it is not therefore to be concluded, that
<PB N="107" REF="166">
the &s;pectacle of this high and ultimate vengeance in &s;uch ca&s;es
is of no efficacy towards reclaiming the petty tran&s;gre&s;&s;or,
or guarding the young again&s;t the allurements of vice and
evil example, or in general, in heightening among the people
that re&s;pect for property, and that e&s;teem of hone&s;t indu|&s;try,
which are the great ba&s;is of the happine&s;s and pro&s;pe|rity
of civil life. Be&s;ides, it is to be remembered, that any
&s;uch lenity in the puni&s;hment of theft is not a matter which
has no relation to others, and may be arranged without re|gard
to them, but, if any con&s;i&s;tency is to be maintained in
the law, mu&s;t be followed with the like relaxation in the
pains of forgery, and many other offences, which, like theft,
are only modes of patrimonial injury. If indeed this were
under&s;tood to be the univer&s;al rule of puni&s;hment for theft,
without regard to the &s;mall value of the thing taken, or
other the extenuating circum&s;tances of the act, there might
be as little to &s;ay for &s;uch an order of things, in re&s;pect of
policy as of humanity. But among the many authorities
which touch upon this point, there is none that argues
for &s;uch exce&s;&s;ive rigour, or carries the precept farther than
this, that a &s;ingle act of theft may warrantably be puni&s;hed
with death, <HI>&s;i &s;it-admodum grave,</HI> if, taken in all its circum|&s;tances,
it is a great and &s;erious offence.</P>
<P>WITH regard to the practice of Scotland:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Pains of &s;imple Theft.</NOTE> Though Mac|kenzie
has treated of it at &s;ome length, it is not with that
order and preci&s;ion which might be wi&s;hed, nor is the gene|ral
re&s;ult of his di&s;cu&s;&s;ion very ea&s;y to be gathered; though,
on the whole, this is ob&s;ervable, that his remarks on the
merciful &s;ide are rather the expre&s;&s;ion of his own &s;entiments
with re&s;pect to the cour&s;e which things ought to have, and
what he &s;ays on the other is an account of the practice
<PB N="108" REF="167">
as it &s;tands, and of the views which have actually govern|ed
it.</P>
<P>THE conclu&s;ion that ari&s;es upon the&s;e, which alone are the
proper &s;ubjects of our attention, &s;eems plainly to be this,
that as theft is not a crime of one fixed and invariable de|gree
of guilt, but may either be a venial or a heinous offence,
according to the circum&s;tances of the act, and the &s;ituation of
the culprit, &s;o by ancient cu&s;tom, grounded on this &s;ub&s;tantial
rea&s;on in the nature of the thing, our Judges have an equi|table
di&s;cretion of attending to the whole particulars of
any ca&s;e, and proportioning the &s;entence to the evil of the
example, and profligacy of the offender; whereby he in
&s;ome in&s;tances may e&s;cape very lightly, and in others &s;hall
&s;uffer the highe&s;t pains that are known to the law. That
is to &s;ay, if on attending to the value of the thing &s;tolen,
the mode of the theft, qualities of the offender, and whole
ca&s;e, the fact appears to be no more than a pickery, to which
he may have been betrayed by youth and opportunity; or
if it is of a higher, but &s;till excu&s;able de&s;cription; or if it
marks a daring or practi&s;ed offender; or is of &s;uch a kind,
that the example of it is very dangerous: I &s;ay, according
to the&s;e equitable con&s;iderations, the Court have power to
deal with the pannel, inflicting the capital pain for even,
one act of &s;imple theft, if taken with all its qualities, it is
a <HI>furtum grave,</HI> and being bound to &s;hew mercy, more or
le&s;s, if it is a mere pilfery, or le&s;s con&s;iderable theft; be|cau&s;e
the cour&s;e of practice hath been, to be tender in &s;uch
ca&s;es.</P>
<P>IN te&s;titnony of this po&s;ition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pains of &s;imple Theft.</NOTE> I may refer to one of the
olde&s;t authorities in our law, the <HI>Leges Burgorum,</HI> which

thirty-two pennies and a half, expre&s;sly order that he
be put to death &startq;<HI>ab eo &s;u&s;pendatur a quo captus e&s;t</HI><NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">L. L. Burg. ch. 121. No. 6.</NOTE>.&endq; In
like manner, our authentic &s;tatute-book, though it does not
contain any law, which declares, as upon a new matter, or by
way of general ordinance, that a thief &s;hall be puni&s;hed ca|pitally,
yet in many places implies that &s;uch is his forfeit,
and cur&s;orily and <HI>narrative</HI> &s;peaks of <HI>the pains of theft and
death,</HI> as of thengs which were known to be one and the
&s;ame. The act 1579, c. 74. orders that a vagabond who de|&s;erts
his ma&s;ter, to whom the magi&s;trate has bound him, and
returns to his vagrant cour&s;es, &s;hall be adjudged and &s;uffer
&startq;<HI>the pains of death, as a thief.</HI>&endq; The act 1581, c. 110. concern|ing
the &s;layers and houghers of oxen, declares in the entrance
of the enacting part, that the&s;e offenders &s;hall be e&s;teemed
and puni&s;hed <HI>as thieves.</HI>&endq; It goes on to &s;ay, that &s;uch as
receive or maintain them, &s;hall be e&s;teemed and puni&s;hed
<HI>as re&s;etters and maintainers of thieves;</HI>&endq; and it fini&s;hes with
an order as to both, that, &startq;being duly called and convict
thereof, they &s;hall incur <HI>the pain of death</HI> and confi&s;cation
of all their gudes moovabil,&endq; thus plainly a&s;&s;uming it as
a known thing, that &s;uch in law was the e&s;timation and pu|ni&s;hment
of a thief. The &s;ame thing is &s;aid in more direct
and conci&s;e form, by the act 1587, c. 83. which ordains that
de&s;troyers of ploughs and plough-gear &startq;&s;hall be puni&s;hed
therefor <HI>to the death, as thieves.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>THIS al&s;o is the conclu&s;ion which ari&s;es on compari&s;on of
the &s;tatutes 1600, c. 11. and 1606, c. 5. again&s;t the &s;laying of
&s;almon in forbidden time. The fir&s;t of the&s;e orders it to
be puni&s;hed &startq;<HI>as theft</HI> in every quality, according to the
committer's rank and e&s;tate;&endq; and the other, which re|cites
the former, and takes away the exception in it of cer|tain:

underlie the paines fore&s;aid <HI>of thrift and death,</HI> according to
the quality, rank and e&s;tate of the committers thereof.&endq;
Mention may al&s;o be made of the &s;tatute 1567, c. 21. which
pre&s;cribes with re&s;pect to thieves when taken, that they
&s;hall be pre&s;ented to the Ju&s;tice and his deputes, &startq;give their
takeris, havand power, <HI>ju&s;tifye them not to the death,</HI> them|&s;elfis.&endq;</P>
<P>THESE may &s;uffice as a &s;pecimen of the language of our
&s;tatute-book on this &s;ubject;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pains of &s;imple Theft.</NOTE> with which the con&s;truction
al&s;o of practice and cu&s;tom entirely agrees. Not that in|&s;tances
are not to be found, and even many in number, of
arbitrary pain applied to a theft of &s;ome importance: but
neither is this anywi&s;e repugnant to our po&s;ition, which
only goes to the a&s;&s;ertion of a di&s;cretionary power in the
Judge to puni&s;h the &s;ingle act with death, in &s;uch ca&s;es where
he &s;hall think that this high correction is due; &s;o that the
very terms of the rule imply a variable cour&s;e of prac|tice,
in which the in&s;tances are numerous to the &s;ide of

<P>THE following are among the ca&s;es, which may be quoted

The Court, in giving judgment, con&s;ider the whole circum|&s;tances
of the ca&s;e, among which the value of the thing
taken is but one, and liable to be affected by the other par|ticulars
of the &s;ituation. It often happens, that the thief
him&s;elf is ignorant of the value of the thing when he takes it,
as in pocket-picking; and it may either be that he had, or that
he had not the opportunity of taking more at the time when
he. &s;tole; on which ground he who &s;teals a &s;heep or two out
of a flock, having it in his power to &s;teal a greater number,

not have if he &s;tole the &s;ame number of &s;heep, when pa&s;tu|ring

kind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 24. and Nov. 1. 1720.</NOTE> is puni&s;hed with death. Thus in the ca&s;e of James
Inglis<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">The Lords find, &startq;That James Inglis, pannel, having at the times libelled, &startq;&s;tolen and the&s;tuou&s;ly taken away from off the &s;treet of Edinburgh, a mare be|longing to Alexander Brown, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and there being a hor&s;e belonging to John Gib&s;on, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;tolen about the time libelled, from Miln's Square in Edinburgh, and the &s;aid hor&s;e, within a few days thereafter, was found and &s;eized in the pannel's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, in the town of Tranent;, and there being another hor&s;e &s;tolen at the time libelled, out of the Cowgate of Edinburgh, and thereafter, within a few days, al&s;o found and &s;eized in the &s;aid pannel's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and that he the pannel, when examined thereupon, did acknowledge that he had &s;tolen the &s;aid la&s;t hor&s;e, all <HI>jointly</HI> relevant to infer the pains of death, and confi&s;cation of moveables; as al&s;o, find <HI>any</HI> of the &s;aids hor&s;es being &s;tolen in manner fore&s;aid, and within a few days found in the pannel's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and he the &s;aid pannel, when examined, acknowledging that he had &s;tolen <HI>any</HI> of the &s;aids hor&s;es, relevant to infer an arbitrary puni&s;hment.&endq; Nov. 1. 1720.</NOTE>, the theft of three hor&s;es is found relevant to infer
<PB N="117" REF="176">
death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">THEFT AND STOUTHRIEF.</NOTE> and the theft of one to infer only an arbitrary pain.
The like di&s;tinction is made in &s;undry trials on the circuits;
and on the 5th March 1734, John Scott, <HI>alias</HI> Park, convict|ed
of &s;tealing a hor&s;e, is only bani&s;hed forth of Scotland,
though he had even &s;tolen it by breaking into a &s;table. On
the whole, it is ob&s;ervable of the&s;e varieties of practice; that
this di&s;cretion of the Court in the puni&s;hing of theft, has
been to the great advantage of the pannel; &s;ince if a &s;tatute
were to be pa&s;&s;ed, appointing an invariable pain for the theft
of hor&s;es or cattle, certainly the public intere&s;t would not
allow this to be any other than the pain of death, in any
ca&s;e, for the taking of even one.</P>
<P>XI. BESIDE this of the value of the thing taken,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of a Thief Ha|bite and Repute.</NOTE> there
are other aggravations of the &s;ingle act of theft, which al&s;o
warrant the in&s;licting of the capital pain; &s;ome of which
have relation to the per&s;on of the thief, and others, to the
mode of the particular theft. Among the former, I &s;hall
fir&s;t attend to that mo&s;t u&s;eful, as well as rea&s;onable rule,
which relates to the character of the pannel, and holds the
&s;ingle act of theft for capital, though not otherwi&s;e a <HI>furtum
grave,</HI> if it be the act of a common thief, (<HI>fur famo&s;us,</HI>) one
who is held and reported, or <HI>habite and repute,</HI> (according to
<PB N="118" REF="177">
our phra&s;e for it), to be one of that calling, and to make or help
his livelihood in the way of thieving. In &s;uch a ca&s;e, the
general character and way of life of the pannel being duly
e&s;tabli&s;hed, the particular act comes to be regarded only as
a confirmation and detected in&s;tance of his daily cour&s;e of
evil doing, and his puni&s;hment to be proportioned to the
habits and calling of the man, as a trained thief, and com|mon
nui&s;ance to the country. In older and more di&s;orderly
times, &s;o much higher was the regard paid to this article of
common <HI>bruit</HI> and fame, that one who &s;tood convicted of it
by an inque&s;t, and could find none to an&s;wer for him, was on
that one ground to be held as a proven thief or robber, and to
be di&s;po&s;ed of accordingly. &startq;<HI>Fiat de eo,&endq;</HI> &s;ays the &s;tatute of

<P>IT is not &s;ufficient to conviction of this charge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proof of Habite and Repute.</NOTE> that the
pannel is a per&s;on of doubtful fame, or one concerning
whom &s;u&s;picions are entertained, and evil rumours have
been abroad. He mu&s;t have laboured under the common
<HI>bruit</HI> and defamation of the neighbourhood as a thief, and
have had a character affixed to him as a brother and a&s;&s;o|ciate
of the trade. In the ca&s;e therefore of George Macdo|nald
<HI>alias</HI> Badenoch,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 18. &amp; 22. 1772.</NOTE> where the jury made this di&s;tinction,
having found, &startq;that it is not proven that the pannel is ha|bite
and repute a thief, although of a &s;u&s;picious character,&endq;
&s;entence of tran&s;portation only en&s;ued.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, with re&s;pect to the proof of this repute:
though judicial proceedings, &s;uch as warrants to &s;earch the
pannel's hou&s;e, or repeated commitments for, or convictions
of theft, are the mo&s;t unexceptionable, they are not however,
the only or an indi&s;pen&s;ible evidence of this &s;ort of charge.
According to the &s;ettled practice, it may equally be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
by the te&s;timony, if po&s;itive and uniform, of cre|dible
and proper witne&s;&s;es, who have cau&s;e of knowledge,
and depone in general terms to the e&s;timation of the pan|nel,
with the neighbourhood and with them&s;elves. We have
in&s;tances of capital conviction in both ways. Upon the

in inferior courts were given in evidence. In that of<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 19. 1786.</NOTE>
<PB N="121" REF="180">
Thomas Gordon, in February 1782, the proof was of the
other de&s;cription, with the exception of one commitment
for an a&s;&s;ault<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">A proof of the &s;ame &s;ort was brought in the ca&s;e of James and Ronald Mac|grigor, in Augu&s;t 1736, upon which the jury found, &startq;that they are reputed to be thieves in the country.&endq;</NOTE>. In the ca&s;e of Wil&s;on and Macdonald,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 29. and Nov. 11. 1751.</NOTE>
there was no te&s;timony to any charge or commitment; but
an a&s;&s;ociate &s;wore to their way of life.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 9. &amp; 1$. 1731.</NOTE> In that of Thomas
Hender&s;on, one witne&s;s &s;wore to a charge of hor&s;e-&s;tealing,
and two to the pannel's general repute.</P>
<P>BY the ordinary &s;tile of indictment, this of <HI>habite and re|pute</HI>
is only laid as an aggravation of the &s;pecial charges
of theft. Should the pannel therefore be acquitted of the&s;e,
and the repute neverthele&s;s be found to be proved, no pu|ni&s;hment
can follow on the verdict, but at mo&s;t only an
award, in the way of prevention, ordaining the pannel to find
caution for his good behaviour. Such an order was accord|ingly
given on conviction to that effect, in the ca&s;e of
James and Ronald Macgrigor.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 4. 1736.</NOTE> It follows on the other part,
that a general verdict of <HI>not guilty</HI> returned on &s;uch a charge,
will not hinder the pannel to be tried, even the next day,
for a different act of theft, charged with the &s;ame aggra|vation,
drawn from his fame and cour&s;e of life. For not
only is the habite and repute no proper point of dittay,
or puni&s;hable accu&s;ation, to which the maxim of&punc; <HI>not tholing
an a&s;&s;ize twice</HI> can apply, but farther, &s;uch a verdict cannot
even be con&s;trued into an acquittal of that quality of the
charge; on which the jury were not bound to pronounce,
unle&s;s &s;ome &s;pecial fact of theft had at the &s;ame time been
proved, &s;o as to make room for that &s;ort of aggravation.
This plea was &s;tated and repelled in the ca&s;e of John Reid,
indicted in Augu&s;t 1774, for &s;tealing &s;heep, and as habite
<PB N="122" REF="181">
and repute a &s;heep-&s;tealer, and who had been acquitted on
the like charge in 1766. It &s;eems too to have been re|pelled
generally, and without any limitation of the proof
to the period between the&s;e years.</P>
<P>XII. FROM this kind of aggravation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Pains of repeated Theft.</NOTE> which amounts to
a pre&s;umption in law, founded on the character of the pan|nel,
that he has often been guilty in the &s;ame &s;ort before,
we naturally pa&s;s to that other, al&s;o capital aggravation,
which ari&s;es from his repeated trial and conviction as a
thief. Which &s;ituation, as it deprives him of all tho&s;e ex|cu&s;es,
which may often be ju&s;tly pleaded for the fir&s;t tre&s;|pa&s;s,
and yields evidence of a perver&s;e and corrupted habit
of mind, &s;o it ju&s;tly places his life in the power of the
Court.</P>
<P>UPON this head, lawyers have propo&s;ed two points to con|&s;ideration;
as to which they have been of different opi|nions
according to their &s;everal ca&s;ts of temper, and views
of human character, or of policy and di&s;cipline. The one
relates to the number of acts, and whether fewer than three,
which &s;hall warrant the inflicting of death, and the other to the
cour&s;e taken with the&s;e acts, whether they mu&s;t be the &s;ubject
of repeated convictions and puni&s;hments, undergone and di&s;|regarded
by the pannel, or if it be &s;ufficient that they are all
proved at the &s;ame time, upon one charge and trial of the
whole. Now, as to the practice of Scotland: it mu&s;t be
evident from what has been already &s;aid of it, that except
with regard to mere pilferies and thefts of the very lowe&s;t
and mo&s;t venial nature, the &s;tate of the law is exclu&s;ive of
any ab&s;olute limitation on either of the&s;e heads. For if
it be true, as has been &s;aid, that the Court have a di&s;cretion|ary
<PB N="123" REF="182">
power with re&s;pect even to a &s;ingle act of theft, to pu|ni&s;h
it according to the wickedne&s;s of the act, as it can be
collected from the whole circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e; much
more mu&s;t they have the like di&s;cretion in the trial of repeat|ed
theft, if the things taken be of any value, &s;uch as rai&s;es
the offence to be more than a pilfery; though the acts are
neither to the number of three, nor have any of them been
the &s;ubject of a former conviction. That is to &s;ay, if upon
the libel which is in Court, being the fir&s;t charge again&s;t
the pannel, he is convicted of two acts of theft, neither of
them incon&s;iderable, and &s;uch as taken together and in their
whole circum&s;tances mark him for a practi&s;ed thief; as if
he have &s;tolen two or three &s;heep at one time, and ten or
twelve pounds at another, by picking the lock of the place
in which it lay; then may &s;entence of death pa&s;s again&s;t
him: though if he were tried for either of the&s;e acts &s;epa|rately,
the &s;ame &s;everity would not be applied to his ca&s;e.
Or, if upon the libel which is in Court, the pannel is con|victed
of one not incon&s;iderable theft, and is al&s;o proved to
have had &s;entence of pillory or &s;courging for another theft
of &s;omewhat le&s;s magnitude, but &s;uch as merited tho&s;e pains,
this progre&s;s in boldne&s;s, and in contempt of the cha&s;ti&s;e|ment
of the law, is in like manner a rea&s;on for dealing
with him, as one who is in the trade, and is not likely to
quit it.</P>
<P>IT is certain that the cour&s;e of practice has been regu|lated
by the&s;e views.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Pains of repeated Theft.</NOTE> Thus, on the 13th December 1557,
John Fidler in Howburn, has &s;entence of death, being con|victed
of &s;tealing eleven wedders, and of re&s;etting his &s;er|vant

have John Brown and Andrew Hall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 29 1616.</NOTE> convicted on one libel
of two acts of &s;tealing a hor&s;e. In like manner, William
Young and John Hamilton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 11. 1698.</NOTE> have &s;entence of death on a ver|dict,

how many), acts of pocket-picking, done in &s;ociety with
each other<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The a&s;&s;ize found it proven, &startq;That John Hamilton, <HI>alias</HI> Scarlet, is guilty of combination and &s;ociety of picking and cutting of pur&s;es or pockets, and other|ways of &s;tealing and thieving at fairs and markets, in &s;o far as he took &s;everal per&s;ons oaths to do the &s;ame; and likewi&s;e find proven, That he is guilty of receiving the &s;ame money &s;tolen, to bear their expence as they went through the country; and al&s;o finds proven, That whatever &s;hould be &s;tolen &s;hould be delivered to him: And as to William Young, finds proven, That he is guilty of a&s;&s;ociation by &s;wearing to Scarlet, and &s;tealing and picking of pockets, and delivering what was &s;tolen to Scarlet: And as to John Garden, finds nothing of the libel proven.&endq; 12th December 1698.</NOTE>.

Hugh Ro&s;s had &s;entence of death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May 18. 19. &amp; 21. 1785.</NOTE> on conviction of &s;tealing
eight &s;heep or lambs at one time, and five lambs at another,
from the &s;ame farm.</P>
<P>THE que&s;tion therefore with us, will only relate to tho&s;e
acts, which properly fall under the appellation of pilfering
or little thieving, &s;uch as the breaking of gardens, or the
&s;tealing of poultry, or of handkerchiefs from the pocket.
With re&s;pect to the&s;e, I have not. found any thing in our re|cords,
to countenance the opinion that fewer than three
offences &s;hall be &s;u&s;tained to infer the pain of death, (if even
that number be &s;ufficient), or that the warning of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive
trials and convictions &s;hall be di&s;pen&s;ed with. To require
that number, &s;eems to be in &s;ome mea&s;ure the common prac|tice
of nations in ca&s;es of this de&s;cription, and the rule has
the &s;upport with us of this circum&s;tance, that with regard
to certain other petty offences, of a nature &s;omewhat allied
to theft, and which are ordered by &s;tatute to be dealt with
accordingly, &s;uch as the de&s;troying of green wood, and the
breaking of dovecotes and cunningaires,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1535, c. 11.; 1579, c. 84.</NOTE> it is only the third
offence, that is puni&s;hed with death.</P>
<P>XIII. The&s;e &s;eem to be the only aggravations relative to
the per&s;on of the thief,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Theft in a landed Man.</NOTE> of which notice can be taken, as
grounds in law, of pronouncing judgment of death on him
<PB N="126" REF="185">
for his crime. The guilt is indeed greater in a near rela|tion
of the owner, or in his dome&s;tic &s;ervant, or other per|&s;on
in a &s;ituation of tru&s;t under him; as it al&s;o is if the
thief be in that rank and &s;ituation of life, which ought to
&s;et him above the temptation of this mean and degrading
vice. But although, in a certain degree, regard will be paid
to any of the&s;e circum&s;tances, as well as to &s;everal others
which are ea&s;y to be imagined; yet it is not in &s;uch a man|ner,
as entitles them to a place in this li&s;t of the known ca|pital
aggravations. In this the condition of the law is dif|ferent
now, from what it was in older and more unruly
times, when thieving was not the peculiar habit of the low
and indigent, but often common to them with per&s;ons of
rank and landed e&s;tate, who not only robbed and plun|dered
them&s;elves, but entertained bands of lawle&s;s and bro|ken
followers, who, emboldened by their countenance and
protection, &s;et the ordinary powers of law, in &s;ome mea&s;ure,
at defiance. To repre&s;s &s;o pernicious a di&s;order, the &s;tatute
1587, c. 50. rai&s;ed the crimes of common theft, re&s;et of
theft, and &s;touthrief in landed men, to the rank and pains
of trea&s;on; and on this law, many convictions were &s;oon
afterwards obtained.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 11. 1601. Mar. 30. and April 1. 1601. Aug. 23. 1603. Jan. 12. 1604. Aug. 12. 1608. Sept. 6. 1610. July 2. 1617.</NOTE> As in the ca&s;e of James David&s;on;

ACCORDING to Mackenzie, the term of <HI>common theft,</HI>

agreeable to the ordinary acceptation of the phra&s;e in
law language, nor to what Mackenzie him&s;elf has el&s;ewhere
&s;aid upon the &s;ame &s;ubject<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Mackenzie, tit. Theft, No. 12, and tit. Robbery, No. 2.</NOTE>. The deci&s;ion of this, or of any
of the other controver&s;ies which had been moved re&s;pecting
the con&s;truction of that &s;tatute, is, however, of no moment
&s;ince the act of the 7th of Queen Anne, ch. 21. which abo|li&s;hed
all the &s;ictitious trea&s;ons of the Scots law, and redu|ced
this &s;ort of theft to its proper rank.</P>
<P>XIV. AMONG tho&s;e aggravations which relate to the
particular act that is under trial,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Theft done by violence.</NOTE> the principal is, if it be
done by means of violence. This may either be directed
again&s;t the per&s;on of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, and then it is properly the
crime of robbery or &s;touthrief, of which afterwards, or
again&s;t the place of cu&s;tody or depo&s;it of the thing, where|to
for &s;ecurity it has been committed.</P>
<P>IN general, it &s;eems to be true of all theft, which is ac|compli&s;hed
by the forcing or effraction of any &s;hut or fa&s;ten|ed
place of keeping, that it is held to be of an aggravated
nature, by rea&s;on of the bold and deliberate temper, which
appears in the manner of the enterpri&s;e. Thus, he who
&s;teals by breaking open a booth, or other the like temporary
place of &s;ale, or by breaking open a che&s;t, cupboard, or
other lockfa&s;t place within a hou&s;e, though his crime is not
thereby &s;o much altered as to receive any peculiar appella|tion,
will, however, be more &s;everely puni&s;hed, (and, it may
be, capitally), than if he had taken the &s;ame article from a
more expo&s;ed and tempting &s;ituation.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="187">
BUT the &s;pecies of violent theft, to which the law has
paid the mo&s;t particular attention,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Theft by Hou&s;e-breaking.</NOTE> is that which is done by
the violent entry of a hou&s;e; for this it now di&s;tingui&s;hes
by the name of hou&s;e-breaking, and holds to be in every in|&s;tance
a capital crime, without regard to the quantity or
value of the &s;poil made, be it ever &s;o incon&s;iderable. The
plain grounds of this &s;everity are, that the thing is done
with that contrivance and deliberation, to which none but
the practi&s;ed offender is equal; and that in thus venturing
his per&s;on to take the thing from within the very &s;anctuary
a&s;&s;igned for keeping it, and notwith&s;tanding all the ob|&s;tacles
contrived for its &s;afe detention, he &s;hows a re&s;olute
and daring &s;pirit, from which even the inhabitants of the
hou&s;e, or any who &s;hall try to &s;eize or &s;tay him in his pur|po&s;e,
mu&s;t, by rea&s;onable inference, be held to be in danger
of their lives and per&s;ons.</P>
<P>IT will not always bring a ca&s;e within the de&s;cription of
hou&s;e-breaking,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Way of Entry in Hou&s;e-break|ing.</NOTE> that the thing is taken out of the hou&s;e,
and by means of an entry made with intent to &s;teal; for
if the entry is at an open door or window, the thief is in
&s;ome mea&s;ure tempted by the opportunity; as well as it is
in &s;ome &s;ort a wrong in the owner to leave his property in
this neglected &s;tate. On the other part, law under&s;tands it
to be hou&s;e-breaking, where&s;oever the thief opens a way in|to
the hou&s;e for him&s;elf, and overcomes the ordinary ob|&s;tacles
provided again&s;t entry thereof, and for the &s;afe keep|ing
of what it contains; though this &s;hould be done with|out
out the piercing or actual effraction of any part of the build|ing
it&s;elf, or of what is attached thereto: &s;ince it is neverthe|le&s;s

This con|&s;truction
is farther warranted by the more ancient ca&s;e of
George Robert&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 16. 1672.</NOTE> who was indicted <HI>(inter alia) for robbing
the hou&s;e</HI> of David Cunningham, having made his entry by
creeping in at the window, after which he opened the door
to his a&s;&s;ociate, Smith, without. The verdict found them
guilty of the <HI>thefts and robberies</HI> libelled; and they had &s;en|tence
of death.</P>
<P>IT may even be maintained,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Way of Entry in Hou&s;e-break|ing.</NOTE> that it is &s;ub&s;tantially a hou&s;e-breaking
in certain ca&s;es, though the immediate act which
gives admi&s;&s;ion is not the act of the thief, but of the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or
of the hou&s;e. If the thief knock at a door by night,
under pretence of a&s;king the way, and upon opening ru&s;h
in and &s;teal, or if thieves be&s;et a hou&s;e to break into it, and
the owner open the door to drive them off, and they over|power
him and enter; in either ca&s;e they &s;eem to be an&s;wer|able
for it, as for an effraction of the building: becau&s;e the
owner is here no better than an in&s;trument in their hands,
and &s;erves, in a manner, as a key to the hou&s;e, which they
<PB N="132" REF="191">
have fraudulently and feloniou&s;ly got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of. The
crime in &s;uch a ca&s;e is an inva&s;ion of the hou&s;e, coupled to
a robbery or &s;touthrief; &s;ince the per&s;on of the ma&s;ter, as
well the &s;trength of the building, oppo&s;es their entry, and
is overcome. We have had two in&s;tances of capital con|viction
upon a charge of this kind.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 10. &amp; 17. 1665.</NOTE> Patrick Macgrigor had
&s;entence of death for the theft of goods and money from
the hou&s;e of Inchbellie, whereof he and his accomplices
obtained entry by calling up the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e under
night, to &s;hew them the way, and threatening to burn the
hou&s;e on his refu&s;al; whereupon his wife, being terrified,
opened and gave acce&s;s to them; and they carried off a
quantity of linen and other goods. The other is the ca&s;e
of John Brown and James Wil&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 28. 1773.</NOTE> who having called the
ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e to the door under night, under the
like pretence, in&s;tantly &s;et upon, beat him down, and kil|led
him; and having thus got entry, broke open his che&s;t,
and carried off a &s;um of money. In the fir&s;t of the&s;e ca&s;es,
the libel was however laid as for theft and hame&s;ucken;
of which la&s;t charge the pannel was acquitted: In the
other, it was laid as for murder, robbery, and <HI>hou&s;e-pillaging.</HI>
To the&s;e illu&s;trations may be added the ca&s;e of a &s;ervant,
who combines with thieves, and opens a window to them,
by which they enter and &s;teal. This &s;eems to be hou&s;e-breaking
in all concerned: for the &s;ervant is art and part
of a felonious entry made by his a&s;&s;ociates; and they make
u&s;e of him, as they would of a pick-lock or other unlawful
in&s;trument, to accompli&s;h their purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>IT is more doubtful,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Breaking out of the Hou&s;e after Stealing.</NOTE> and in England a &s;tatute was
therefore pa&s;&s;ed upon the ca&s;e, whether one who con|ceals
<PB N="133" REF="192">
him&s;elf in a hou&s;e with intent to &s;teal, and after &s;teal|ing
breaks out of the hou&s;e, to make his e&s;cape, is guilty of
the &s;ame crime. The contrivance, deliberation, and even
boldne&s;s of &s;uch an attempt, may &s;eem to be little le&s;s than
that of him who makes his way through the inclo&s;ure of
the hou&s;e before &s;tealing. Yet I find, that in two ca&s;es
of this de&s;cription,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 27. 1774.</NOTE> that of James Mackenzie, and that of
William Wright,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 10. 1774.</NOTE> the charge is laid as for &s;imple theft, and
the pannels are tran&s;ported on their own petition.</P>
<P>IT may likewi&s;e admit a que&s;tion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lodger breaking into another Chamber.</NOTE> whether it comes up to
the notion of hou&s;e-breaking, (though it is an aggravated
theft, and may &s;ometimes be puni&s;hed with death), that one
who is lawfully within a hou&s;e, &s;uch as the occupier of a hired
chamber, forces the door of another chamber of the hou&s;e in
the night time, and &s;teals. It is true, there is here a breaking
of what is part of the hou&s;e, to accompli&s;h the &s;tealing; but
&s;till the thief is under the roof, and within the inclo&s;ure
of the tenement, and has thus both better opportunity, and
greater temptation to &s;teal, than one who has to force his
way from without. Such a ca&s;e was that of Wil&s;on, Hall,
and Robert&s;on, (tried in March 1736), who all had &s;entence
of death, for forcibly breaking into a locked chamber in an
inn, from another room where they had been drinking
under night, and carrying off the money and effects of a
lodger, who made his e&s;cape by the window, to avoid
their violence. But the charge was made under the &s;eve|ral
names of <HI>hou&s;e-breaking, &s;touthrief or robbery,</HI> to either of
which la&s;t the fact certainly amounted; &s;ince the things were
taken from under the &s;pecial protection of the owner, and
by means of an a&s;&s;ault upon his per&s;on: Neither can it be
&s;aid, upon the words of the interlocutor, to which of tho&s;e de|nominations
<PB N="134" REF="193">
the act was referred by the Court<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The Lords &s;ind, &startq;That the &s;aid pannels, or any of them, having, time and place libelled, <HI>by violence broken into the room</HI> where James Stark, collec|tor, was lodged, or that they or any of them did carry off bank-notes, gold, &s;il|ver, or other goods out of the &s;aid room, or that they or any of them were art and part of any of the &s;aid crimes, relevant to infer the pains of law.&endq; 9th March 1736.</NOTE>. But in
whichever way this point &s;hall be &s;ettled, it will not be pre|tended
that there can be any protection to the per&s;on, who,
being lodged in a barn or other out-hou&s;e, &s;hall leave it in the
night, and enter the man&s;ion-hou&s;e, or any other of the out-hou&s;es,
by breaking in at the door or window: If he does
&s;o, his act is quite the &s;ame, as that of one who has come
from a greater di&s;tance.</P>
<P>IN regard to the circum&s;tance of entering the hou&s;e:<NOTE PLACE="marg">What a &s;ufficient Entry of the Hou&s;e.</NOTE>
This is no otherwi&s;e material to the notion of hou&s;e-break|ing,
than as it enables the thief to &s;eize and remove &s;ome
thing which is under the protection and keeping of the build|ing.
It is not therefore nece&s;&s;ary that the thief have been
within the hou&s;e with his whole per&s;on: He is guilty, if he
has been in it in &s;uch a manner, and being &s;o by violence, that
he carries &s;omething off from within it. As if he forces open
the ca&s;ement of a window, and putting in his hand only,
&s;natches up, and runs off with any article that lies within
his reach. This was the opinion of the Court, upon the de|bate
in the ca&s;e of William Gade&s;by,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 21. 1790.</NOTE> who had &s;entence of
death upon conviction to that effect. The Engli&s;h authori|ties,
&s;peaking of the crime of burglary<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">See Black&s;tone, vol. iv. p. 227.</NOTE>, have &s;aid, that
there is even a &s;ufficient entry by the pu&s;hing of a hook,
pole, or other in&s;trument, into the hou&s;e, to draw out goods,
<PB N="135" REF="194">
though the offender have never been within it, with any
part of his body. And, if this be true of that crime, which
con&s;i&s;ts in the breaking of a hou&s;e, with intent to commit
a felony, though that object &s;hould not be accompli&s;hed,
much &s;tronger rea&s;on is there for the &s;ame con&s;truction ap|plied
to our crime of hou&s;e breaking, which is only then
committed, when by means of the violent entry &s;omething
has actually been taken away; &s;o that the breaking and en|try
have fully an&s;wered the invader's purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>IT is likewi&s;e certain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May be art and part, without Entry.</NOTE> and falls under the common rules
of <HI>art and part,</HI> that a per&s;on may be convicted of hou&s;e-breaking,
though with re&s;pect to him per&s;onally, there has
never been an entry of the hou&s;e at all.<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 6. 1780.</NOTE> Thus, Donald&s;on

of death along with Donald&s;on. On the 7th of the
&s;ame month, Charles Cocks had &s;entence of death, for an ac|ce&s;&s;ion
of the &s;ame kind. Al&s;o, in the ca&s;e, already mentioned,

&s;touthrief or violent theft), the office of Robert&s;on, as char|ged
in the libel, was to watch at the door of the inn, while
his a&s;&s;ociates, above &s;tairs, were employed in breaking up
the door of the chamber.</P>
<P>IT has already been intimated,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Theft by Hou&s;e-breaking always capital.</NOTE> that the notion of hou&s;e-breaking
in the law of Scotland, is theft committed by vio|lent
entry of the hou&s;e; &s;o that without the removal of &s;ome
article, in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e as already explained, under the
head of &s;imple theft, there is no ground for this &s;ort of charge.
But if any thing is taken, it &s;ignifies not of how little value
<PB N="136" REF="195">
it be. The re&s;olute and dangerous di&s;po&s;ition of the thief, is
manife&s;t in the way of his attack; and it cannot be doubted
of him who comes in this fa&s;hion, that more he would have
taken, if more had fallen under his hands, and all circum|&s;tances
had &s;uited to carry it away. Many ca&s;es might be
cited in proof of this, but I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to one,
which may &s;erve in&s;tead of all others; the ca&s;e, already men|tioned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 15. 1698.</NOTE>

notion of being parcel of the man&s;ion. And this may be
a rea&s;onable limitation according to the proper notion of
burglary, already taken notice of, but would be quite un|&s;uitable,
and is not admitted in our law, which only recog|ni&s;es
the capital offence, when there is a &s;tealing as well as
breaking. Every edifice, therefore, to what u&s;e &s;oever de|&s;tined,
whether it be a counting-room, public office, place
of work, &s;ale, &s;tore, or what el&s;e, is the &s;ubject: of a capital
pain in the breaking; &s;o it be what can properly be con&s;i|dered,
and in common &s;peech would be called, a hou&s;e, or
&s;hut and fa&s;t building, and is not a mere open &s;hed, booth,
or temporary place of lumber. Charles Cunningham was
capitally convicted on the 12th March 1783, for breaking
into a wa&s;h-hou&s;e at one time, and a bru&s;hmaker's work-hou&s;e

the &s;ame, and equally falls under the capital &s;anction,

<P>XV. THE other prime in&s;tance of forcible theft,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Robbery or Stouthrief.</NOTE> is that
which is committed by inva&s;ion of the per&s;on, and is now

&s;ort of ma&s;terful theft or depredation.</P>
<P>1. IT is proper in this place to repeat what has already
been &s;aid of theft in general,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Robbery, if nothing is taken.</NOTE> but might perhaps he &s;uppo&s;ed
not to apply here, on account of the aggravation of vio|lence,
&mdash;that the charge will not lie unle&s;s &s;omething be
carried away. Though an a&s;&s;ault be made with intent to
take, and be on the very point of &s;ucceeding, as by the per&s;on
having his pur&s;e in his hand to deliver, or letting it fall from
his hand through trepidation, or being beaten to the ground
in&s;en&s;ible, &s;o that accident only hinders the full accompli&s;h|ment
of the invader's purpo&s;e, it &s;till is not a robbery, but
only an attempt to rob; which may however be puni&s;hed
at common law, with the highe&s;t arbitrary pain. Be&s;ide
the rea&s;ons for this in the nature it&s;elf of the act; under any
other con&s;truction, the notion of the complete crime would be
altogether arbitrary and uncertain<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>It was argued for the pro&s;ecutor, in the ca&s;e of Cran&s;toun, in September 1723, that it was &s;ufficient if the robber were once ma&s;ter of the <HI>per&s;on,</HI> for that he was thus ma&s;ter of his money too.

Gavin Lowrie, 18th March 1783, of David and William
Dalglei&s;h, 4th April 1780, and John Irvine, 25th September
1744, the a&s;&s;aulting and beating, or firing at a per&s;on with
intent to rob, or on account of the refu&s;al to deliver, is
charged as a di&s;tinct and &s;eparate crime from robbery<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>&startq;As al&s;o the a&s;&s;aulting the lieges, and firing at them, in order to force them to give up or deliver their property, though not attended with the &s;aid effect, or the &s;o firing, becau&s;e &s;uch money or effects were not delivered up,&endq; <HI>&amp;c.

For the &s;ame rea&s;on, the charge in the libel again&s;t Robert
Steedman was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 11. 1782.</NOTE> with re&s;pect to one article, made alternative,
as for robbery, or an attempt to rob; the fact in that in|&s;tance
being, that the per&s;on a&s;&s;aulted having taken out his
watch to deliver it, either he let it fall, owing to confu&s;ion,
or it was by a chance-blow &s;truck to the ground, where it
was found lying, without ever, as far as appeared, having
been in the pannel's hand. Acts of complete robbery
were al&s;o charged in the libel; and the interlocutor was ge|neral,
for the pains of law.</P>
<P>2. IN the con&s;truction of what &s;hall be deemed a <HI>taking,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">What is con|&s;trued a taking by Robbery.</NOTE>
we rather attend to the &s;ub&s;tance of the ca&s;e, which is that
the thing has come into the hands of the invader by
means of his violence, than to the mode it&s;elf of the imme|diate
act of apprehen&s;ion. The pur&s;e &s;hall therefore be
held to be <HI>taken,</HI> though the owner, being terrified, have
<PB N="141" REF="200">
with his own hand delivered it on demand; or though it
have fallen to the ground in a &s;truggle between them, if
the invader lift it; or though the owner, meaning to &s;ave
it, ca&s;t it a&s;ide into &s;ome place, where the invader di&s;|covers
and &s;eizes it: for &s;till the thing pa&s;&s;es into his po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
by means of the a&s;&s;ault which he has made. Thus,
in the ca&s;e of Ander&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 20. 1791.</NOTE> Paul and Bannatyne, one of the
articles charged to be taken from the per&s;on robbed, and
which led to the di&s;covery of the pannels as the robbers,
was his hat, which had fallen from his head, in bringing
him to the ground, and was laid hold of by one of the a&s;|&s;ailants.
And this the Court held to be an article of the
robbery, as much as their taking the money from his poc|ket.
A plea of this &s;ort was &s;et up for Samuel Riccards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 27. and June 19. &amp; 20. 1710.</NOTE>
who argued, that to prevail on a woman by terror of his
threats, to deliver him a little money with her own hands,
was not robbery, but only concu&s;&s;ion. No regard was paid
to this &s;trange defence.</P>
<P>3. IN the con&s;truction al&s;o of the <HI>carrying away.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">What a &s;uffi|cient carrying away</NOTE> the

Cran&s;toun,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 10 &amp; 11. 1723.</NOTE> who had &s;entence of death for the taking of only
one article, with which he was apprehended on the &s;pot, and
in pre&s;ence of the per&s;on robbed.</P>
<P>4. THE taking and carrying away mu&s;t be by inva&s;ion of
the per&s;on of another.<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Robbery without inva|&s;ion of the per|&s;on.</NOTE> This is not, however, to be under|&s;tood
in the literal &s;en&s;e, as if robbery could only be com|mitted

per&s;on at the time, but in a loo&s;e and more general &s;en&s;e,
as applicable to what&s;oever thing is under the per&s;o|nal
care and protection of the &s;ufferer; &s;o that unle&s;s by
force or terror to him applied, it cannot be taken away.
The&s;e things therefore amount to robbery; the taking of a
per&s;on's hor&s;e from him, as he travels on the highway, or
the hor&s;e of his &s;ervant who is attending him there, or his
portmanteau from behind his &s;ervant, (which charge was
accordingly found relevant in the ca&s;e of Chri&s;topher Hog<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">&startq;The Lords find the pannell, his having, the time and place lybelled, at|tacked George Sheriff, factor to the Earl of Hopetoun, and taking a clogbag from behind a &s;ervant of the &s;aid George Sheriff's that was riding with him, and predoniou&s;ly carried away the &s;amen, or was art and part thereof, relevant to infer the pains of death, and confi&s;cation of moveables.&endq;</NOTE>),
or the forcible taking of goods from a waggon which he is
conducting,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 7. &amp; 21. and Dec. 12. 1720.</NOTE> or of &s;heep from among a flock which he is
driving on the road, or of goods from a &s;hip which he has
charge of, whether in port, or &s;tranded on the &s;hore.</P>
<P>5. IT is another and an indi&s;pen&s;ible circum&s;tance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What violence nece&s;&s;ary to Robbery.</NOTE> that
the thing be taken by violence; for herein is the di&s;tinctive
<PB N="143" REF="202">
character of the crime. But in the con&s;truction of this
article, great latitude is u&s;ed. There may be robbery
without any wounding or beating of the per&s;on, (which,
where it happens, may therefore be libelled as an aggrava|tion,
as it was in the ca&s;e of James Andrew);<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 22. 1783.</NOTE> and al&s;o with|out
any forcible wre&s;ting or tearing of the thing from the
per&s;on, or even any &s;ort of &s;truggle on the part of the &s;uffer|er
to detain it. The law only means to oppo&s;e this &s;ort of
taking, as again&s;t the will of the owner, to that which hap|pens
privately, or by &s;urpri&s;e, (in neither of which is there
any application to the will or the fears of the &s;ufferer), and
under&s;tands it therefore to be violence, if the thing is ta|ken
by means of &s;uch behaviour and proceedings, as ju&s;t|ly
alarm for the per&s;onal and in&s;tant con&s;equences of re|&s;i&s;tance
or refu&s;al. The mere di&s;play, therefore, of force,
and preparation of mi&s;chief, whether this appears in the
weapons &s;hewn, in the number and combination of the a&s;|&s;ailants,
or in their words, ge&s;tures, and demeanour, if on
the whole circum&s;tances of the &s;ituation it may rea&s;on|ably
intimidate and overawe, is a proper de&s;cription of vio|lence,
to found a charge of robbery. In the ca&s;e of Ric|cards,
already quoted, the interlocutor of relevancy is as
follows: &startq;Find the pannel's having, the time libelled, <HI>in a
rude and violent manner,</HI> with a mortal weapon in his hand,
attacked Eliza^t^h Bruce upon the highway libelled, and rob|bed
from her money and goods, relevant to infer the pains
of death.&endq; The libel in this ca&s;e bore, that the woman,
being threatened, delivered what money &s;he had upon her. On
the proof al&s;o again&s;t Stuart, Bannatyne, and Paul, who had
all of them &s;entence of death for one act of robbery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 20. 1791.</NOTE> it did not
appear that the a&s;&s;ault was accompanied with &s;how of arms,
nor with any &s;ort of harm to the per&s;on robbed, farther than
<PB N="144" REF="203">
by pulling him to the ground, without a blow or other inju|ry
of body.</P>
<P>MORE particularly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is Robbery without having of arms.</NOTE> as to the &s;howing or having of arms or
offen&s;ive weapons; whether this circum&s;tance did or did not
make any difference in the Roman law, (for that is a di&s;pu|ted
point), it certainly is not material in ours, as appears
from the ca&s;e of Barclay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 31. 1758.</NOTE> which i&s;&s;ued in a capital convic|tion,
notwith&s;tanding the exception which on that ground
had been taken to the libel. The charge again&s;t Hugh
Lundie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 25. 1754.</NOTE> is, as to one act, thus, That he jumped over a wall
to a highway where two women were pa&s;&s;ing, &startq;called out
to them, <HI>Damn you &s;tand,</HI> and immediately thereafter, he
gripped the &s;aid Mary Burnet, put his hand in her pocket,
and took from thence 81/2d. Serling.&endq; In another in&s;tance,
the libel relates the matter thus, That he overtook a woman
on the road, and addre&s;&s;ed her, &startq;demanding or a&s;king &s;ix-pence
from her, to which &s;he having an&s;wered, <HI>for what?</HI>
he thereupon gripped her, took hold of her pocket, and
robbed her of 2s. Sterling, being all the money &s;he had
then upon her.&endq; A third charge is for the robbery of
Elizabeth Allan, to whom the pannel had come up, &startq;a&s;king
of her if &s;he had any money? to which &s;he &s;aid, that &s;he
had not, whereupon he forcibly laid hold of her pockets,
and took out thereof 2s. Sterling.&endq; The&s;e charges were
found relevant, and the man was condemned and executed.
But it is not even nece&s;&s;ary that there be, as in the&s;e in&s;tan|ces,
a &s;eizure of the per&s;on, and a taking by the hand of the
invader. All fear of danger, ari&s;ing from a con&s;tructive vio|lence,
which is gathered from the mode and circum&s;tances
of the demand, being &s;uch as ordinarily carry awe and ter|ror
with them, and may naturally$induce a man to &s;urrender
<PB N="145" REF="204">
his property for the &s;afety of his per&s;on, is &s;ufficient to make
a taking <HI>again&s;t the will of the &s;ufferer;</HI> which is the e&s;&s;ence
of robbery.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems however to be a point,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fear of per&s;onal violence, if e&s;|&s;ential to rob|bery.</NOTE> which is at lea&s;t worthy
of con&s;ideration, (though in England it has more than once
been determined again&s;t the pri&s;oner<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See ca&s;e of Daniel Hickman, July 1783; Patrick Donally, February 1779; and Samuel Ga&s;coigne, October 1783. Leach's Ca&s;es in Crown Law, No. 124. 93. 125.</NOTE>), whether it will ju&s;tify
the charge of robbery, that the delivery is made out of fear
of &s;ome other evil than per&s;onal and in&s;tant danger; as if
money be extorted from a per&s;on by means of threats to
&s;et his hou&s;e on fire, or to carry him to goal, or to bring a
charge of &s;odomy again&s;t him. The ground of di&s;tinction
&s;eems to be this, that the&s;e are future dangers, again&s;t which
as the per&s;on a&s;&s;aulted has the means of protection from the
law, and otherwi&s;e; &s;o, as a man of ordinary con&s;tancy, he is
bound to &s;ubdue the apprehen&s;ion of them. Whereas, the
fear of in&s;tant and unavoidable injury to the per&s;on con|&s;trains
and ju&s;tifies &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; on which account it is that
the law &s;o &s;everely puni&s;hes the offender, who proceeds
in that way. The be&s;t, but I &s;hall not &s;ay a &s;ufficient reply
to this objection, may &s;eem to be, that the demand of mo|ney
in the&s;e ways may &s;ometimes be attended with &s;uch
circum&s;tances, as beget a rea&s;onable fear of pre&s;ent violence,
though not expre&s;sly threatened, in ca&s;e of refu&s;al to com|ply;
and that the manner of the demand is truly no better
than a di&s;gui&s;e, which will be thrown off as &s;oon as oc|ca&s;ion
&s;hall require. In whichever way that point &s;hall be
&s;ettled, (with us it has not yet occurred), this at lea&s;t will
not be the &s;ubject of controver&s;y, that if the per&s;on only
<PB N="146" REF="205">
promi&s;es money at the time, and &s;ends it afterwards, when
out of the reach of per&s;onal violence, and free of any in|&s;tant
terror, it is a crime of quite a different nature, as
much as where a per&s;on complies with the demand of an
incendiary letter.</P>
<P>6. IN the &s;ixth and la&s;t place:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thing mu&s;t be taken feloni|ou&s;ly.</NOTE> robbery has this in common
with theft, that the thing mu&s;t be taken with a felonious
intent; I mean on its own account, and with the purpo&s;e to
appropriate it, not being the property of the invader. Thus,
if John a&s;&s;ault James to beat him, and in the &s;truggle John
become ma&s;ter of James's &s;taff and carry it off, this is not
a robbery; becau&s;e the &s;taff is not the object of the a&s;&s;ault,
and if at all attended to at the time, is not taken with
an intention to keep it. This &s;eems to have been the de|&s;cription
of the ca&s;e of Edgar Wright,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 15. 1788.</NOTE> where a pi&s;tol was
carried off in the cour&s;e of a drunken &s;quabble, and mutual
violence.</P>
<P>IT is immaterial in our practice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Place of taking is immaterial</NOTE> though it &s;eems to be
otherwi&s;e in that of England, whether the thing be taken
on the highway, or el&s;ewhere. When taken on the high|way,
this circum&s;tance, like the &s;hewing of arms, or abu&s;e
of the per&s;on, has &s;ometimes been charged as an aggrava|tion;
as in the ca&s;e of John Irvine, 25th September 1744,
and Charles Ro&s;s, 23d February 1747. It is al&s;o immaterial
of what value the thing taken be; for though the value be
ever &s;o little,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Value of the Thing taken is immaterial.</NOTE> the danger and terror of the mode of taking
make the robbery in every in&s;tance a capital offence, and
place the crime along with murder, rape, and fire-rai&s;ing,
among the pleas of the Crown. This doctrine has never been
di&s;puted, and is exemplified in many judgments of modern

date. The&s;e are among the number; the ca&s;e of Barclay,
31&s;t July 1758, for robbing of a &s;ilver watch, of the value of
four guineas; of Thomas Hickton and Francis Simp&s;on, 12th
March 1759, for robbing of a &s;ilver watch, worth four
pounds; of Robert Hay, 9th February 1767, for robbing
of a &s;ilver watch and forty &s;hillings; of David and William
Dalglei&s;h, 4th April 1780, for robbing of &s;ive &s;hillings and
a bundle of papers; of James Andrew, 22d December 1783,
for robbing of a &s;ilver watch; of Chalmers and Feagan, for
robbing of a gold watch, 8th April 1783. But the mo&s;t re|markable
of any is the ca&s;e of James Cran&s;ton, in September

been taken<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Verdict.</HI> &startq;Find, That the pannel, on the day libelled, robbed Mr Charles Cockburn of his cane; al&s;o with one voice find the whole other circura&s;tances proven in terms of the Lords their interlocutor.&endq; The other circum&s;tances here referred to were the&s;e, That the pannel was &s;een and heard to demand Mr Cockburn's money, with a pi&s;tol in his hand; that he was found &s;tanding by him, and threatened to &s;hoot tho&s;e who came up, and that Mr Cockburn, at this time, declared that he was robbed.

<P>BEFORE I conclude,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Same Act may be Robbery and Hou&s;e-breaking.</NOTE> it may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve, that
the &s;ame act may &s;ometimes with propriety be charged both
as robbery, and under other denominations. In addition
to &s;ome in&s;tances of this which have already been taken
notice of, I will mention one more; the ca&s;e of Robert Cal|der,
again&s;t whom the charge was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 9. 1762.</NOTE> that he had entered a
lady's bed-chamber, in the night, by opening the ca&s;ement
of a window, to which he a&s;cended by a ladder, and that
<PB N="148" REF="207">
&s;he being alarmed, he by threats and violence &s;ubdued her
re&s;i&s;tance, and compelled her to deliver certain jewels which
were in the chamber at the time. Now this was both a
hou&s;e-breaking, by the violent entry of the tenement, and
at the &s;ame time a robbery in the hou&s;e, by the taking of
things from under the per&s;onal protection of the owner, and
by putting her in fear: It accordingly went to trial under both
denominations; but the pannel was acquitted. Perhaps the
mo&s;t &s;uitable term of any to be employed in &s;uch ca&s;es, is
our ancient, but of late neglected term of <HI>Stouthrief,</HI> or vio|lent
theft, which embraces every &s;ort of theft that is done
by open force, and in contempt of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the
things which are taken.</P>
<P>UNDER this de&s;cription &s;eems to fall that mode of theft,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Her&s;hip or Depredation.</NOTE>
not &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to be con&s;idered at large now, as in former
times, which was di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Her&s;hip or
Herd&s;hip; being the driving away of numbers of cattle,
or other <HI>be&s;tial,</HI> by the ma&s;terful force of armed people.
This, according to Mackenzie, is the &s;ame offence with the
<HI>crimen abigeatus</HI> of the Roman law: but whether the cha|racter
of the <HI>abigeus</HI> lay in his violent manner of depreda|tion,
or in his habit of offending, and the quantity of his
&s;poil, (which is at lea&s;t doubtful on the texts of the Ro|man
law<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See L. 1. 2. and 3. Dig. de Abigeis. Carp&s;ov. Comm. ad. h. tit.&mdash;Al&s;o Voet, ej. Tit.</NOTE>), certain it is, that we need not re&s;ort to that
&s;y&s;tem, for authority to inflict a capital pain on the com|mitter
of her&s;hip. For if the cattle are driven off in the
corporal pre&s;ence of the owners or their people; as in the
ca&s;e of Lauchlan Macinto&s;h, who, in company with twen|ty
<PB N="149" REF="208">
armed men, drove off three &s;core oxen and &s;eventeen cows,
and wounded the tenants and others who pur&s;ued them<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The a&s;&s;ize &startq;Finds the pannel L.

as in the ca&s;e of Donald Bain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 3. &amp; 10. 1722.</NOTE> who, with a band of twenty
armed men, drove off a herd of eighty-three cows, in pre|&s;ence
of the two keepers, whom they a&s;&s;aulted and bound;
this is an undoubted robbery; and as &s;uch it went to trial<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">&startq;Find that the pannel having at the time and place libelled, with a compa|ny of armed men, <HI>robbed</HI> and carried off a herd of cattle; or, after carrying off the &s;aid cattle, when the pannel and his accomplices were pur&s;ued by a party of men, in order to re&s;cue the &s;aid cattle, he the pannel did &s;ire, or attempt to fire upon, or with his &s;word made re&s;i&s;tance to the &s;aid party, or any one of them, or that the pannel was art and part of either of the fore&s;aid alternatives, <HI>&s;eparatim,</HI> relevant to infer the pain of death, and confi&s;cation of moveables, and repel the haill defences proponed for the pannel.&endq; 10th Dec. 1722.</NOTE>
in the&s;e ca&s;es. But even when the taking happens out of the
pre&s;ence of the owners, or their &s;ervants, who fly perhaps
on the approach of &s;uch a crew, it is &s;till a ca&s;e of violent
and ma&s;terful taking, or <HI>Brigancy,</HI> (as it is &s;ometimes call|ed),
and &s;touthrief, and not of &s;imple theft; by rea&s;on of the
circum&s;tances of open inva&s;ion and general alarm to the
neighbourhood, with which the &s;poil is committed. I &s;hall
not enter into any farther di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the law concerning
tho&s;e wa&s;teful injuries, now almo&s;t unknown, though former|ly
&s;o frequent and &s;o de&s;tructive, as obliged the Legi&s;lature
to have recour&s;e to all manner of expedients, to repre&s;s them.
By one &s;tatute, (1587, c. 101.), the reparation of the lo&s;s is
laid on the captain or &s;uperior of the clan, within who&s;e ter|ritory
<PB N="150" REF="209">
the goods are received, &s;hared, or di&s;po&s;ed of: And
by another, (1581, c. 112.), the owners are empowered to
&s;eize and detain, until reparation made, as well the body as
the goods of any per&s;on of the &s;ame clan to which the
offenders belong.</P>
<P>THESE &s;eem to be the chief aggravations in the manner of
the particular act,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Theft of Things &s;acred.</NOTE> which rai&s;e a theft to the degree of a
capital crime at common law. It does not appear that we
have any &s;ettled rule of puni&s;hing with death, the theft of
&s;uch things as are de&s;tined to &s;acred or religious u&s;es; though
it is certainly an unfavourable circum&s;tance to the pannel.
And it is true,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 6. 1556.</NOTE> that in the ca&s;e of Adam Sinclair and Henry
Elderlous, convicted for breaking into the church of Forres,
and &s;tealing chalices, prie&s;ts ornaments, and gold and &s;ilver,
the one had &s;entence to be hanged, and the other to be
drowned; which, too, is expre&s;&s;ed to be <HI>ex &s;peciali gratia re|ginae;</HI>
probably in lieu of &s;ome more cruel mode of death.</P>
<P>XVI. IN regard to tho&s;e thefts which are puni&s;hable with
death by &s;pecial &s;tatute;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statutory capi|tal Thefts.</NOTE> the li&s;t of them is very &s;hort, com|pared
with that which has been found nece&s;&s;ary in the &s;itua|tion
of England. Indeed I find but one enactment of this
kind (be&s;ide tho&s;e, already mentioned, relative to &s;tealing
from the mail), which, for certain, extends to this part of
the united kingdom. I allude to the act 18th Geo. II. c. 27.
by which it is made a capital offence to &s;teal any linen, cot|ton,
callico, or other &s;tuff there mentioned, to the value of
ten &s;hillings, from any bleaching-croft, or from any ground,
place, or building, made u&s;e of by any callico-printer, bleach|er,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> for printing, whitening, bleaching, or drying of the
&s;ame. The &s;tatute, however, be&s;tows a di&s;cretion on the
<PB N="151" REF="210">
Judge, which with us has been liberally employed, of or|dering
the offender to be tran&s;ported for fourteen years,
in ca&s;es where he &s;hall think it rea&s;onable.</P>
<P>XVII. I HAVE now touched upon the&s;e things,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;to|len Goods, its Effect as Evi|dence.</NOTE> which &s;eem
chiefly to be ob&s;ervable, whether with re&s;pect to the de&s;crip|tion
or the puni&s;hment of theft. In the clo&s;e of all, I &s;hall
add a few words concerning that circum&s;tance, by which,
more commonly than any other, the offender is detected,
and his guilt brought to light. I mean his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
&s;tolen goods. That this, by it&s;elf, &s;hall in every ca&s;e be
&s;ufficient to conviction, would be too broad a po&s;ition. Like
that of other circum&s;tances, the weight of it may be great|er
or le&s;s, according as the relative particulars in the
ca&s;e happen to be. But, generally, it &s;eems to be true,
that if the pannel is found in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the thing re|cently
after it has been &s;tolen, this, as it very much le&s;|&s;ens
the likelihood of his having got it otherwi&s;e than by
&s;tealing, is always a &s;trong ingredient of evidence, and &s;uch
as if aided by any other circum&s;tance of moment, will be
held a relevant ground of condemnation. If he has con|fe&s;&s;ed
upon examination, before a magi&s;trate; if he is a per|&s;on
of evil fame, and pick-locks are found on him; if he of|fers
money to the officers of ju&s;tice, to let him e&s;cape; or if
he denies that he has the goods, and they are found in hid|den
or unlikely places; any one of the&s;e particulars, joined
with his recent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the thing, and his inability to
&s;how a fair way of coming by it, will &s;erve to turn the ba|lance
again&s;t him. This is the doctrine which re&s;ults from
the interlocutors given in the&s;e, among many other ca&s;es,
which might be mentioned to the &s;ame effect: February

<P>RESET OF THEFT is the receiving and keeping of &s;tolen
goods,<NOTE PLACE="marg">RESET OF THEFT.</NOTE> knowing them to be &s;uch, and with the inten|tion
to conceal them from the owner. And this offence
makes a proper &s;equel of tho&s;e of theft and robbery, as being
<PB N="154" REF="213">
in &s;ome mea&s;ure a continuation of them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. III.</NOTE> and that which by
its &s;ub&s;erviency to the convenience of the thief, is one great
means of attaching him to his unlawful cour&s;e of life.</P>
<P>1. IT is the fundamental circum&s;tance in the de&s;cription
of this crime,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Re&s;etter mu&s;t be in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</NOTE> that the &s;tolen goods are received into the
offender's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. That the per&s;on of the thief, ha|ving
the &s;tolen goods with him, is received and entertained
by one who knows him to be &s;uch, and al&s;o knows the
quality of the goods, is likewi&s;e a crime, but a different
one from re&s;et of theft; which requires a &s;pecial concern of
the re&s;etter with the goods, a contrectation by him of the
things them&s;elves, for the purpo&s;e of detention and conceal|ment.
Not that there may not be proper re&s;et, though the
thief continue in the hou&s;e: for if the goods be once com|mitted
to the peculiar care and keeping of the ma&s;ter of the
hou&s;e, as by di&s;po&s;ing of them about his per&s;on, locking
them up in his che&s;t, or hiding them, with his knowledge or
connivance, in &s;ome &s;ecret place within his hou&s;e, this is a
contrectation by him, and a clear ground of conviction. And
on this footing proceeded the interlocutor of relevancy in
the ca&s;e of Ander&s;on and others, in March 1701, and the
&s;entence of infamy and bani&s;hment upon John Tennant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 29. and Aug. 10. 11. 1714.</NOTE> in
the ca&s;e of Hutchie&s;on, Tennant, and others: for in both in|&s;tances
the thieves were taken in the re&s;etter's hou&s;e<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">As far as concerns Tennant, the verdict, is in the&s;e words: &startq;Find, That John Tennant had the breeches and carabine libelled, and produced in Court, conceal|ed in his hou&s;e, and that he kept a public-hou&s;e for travellers, proven; and finds the pocket-book&punc; produced in Court, to have been concealed, and found upon the per&s;on of the &s;aid Tennant; but do not find the property thereof to be proven to be Robert Barr's.&endq; The&s;e three articles were part of the goods &s;tolen by the other pannels, Huchie&s;on and Macdougall, who had &s;entence of death.</NOTE>. The
<PB N="155" REF="214">
rule, therefore, is only meant to be delivered thus; that to
harbour and entertain the thief, whether gratuitou&s;ly, or for
reward as a publican, he keeping the goods under his own
exclu&s;ive care and cu&s;tody, though with the knowledge of
the entertainer, will not involve that per&s;on as re&s;etter.</P>
<P>BUT if the pannel receive the goods into his keeping, it
&s;eems not to be material upon what footing, or by what
manner of covenant, this happens; whether for his own be|hoof,
as upon pledge, purcha&s;e, or exchange of them, or
as depo&s;itary only for behoof of the thief. In either ca&s;e,
he feloniou&s;ly continues the detention of the property
from the owner, and does the &s;ame injury al&s;o to the public,
by &s;ecuring to the thief the reward of his indu&s;try, and
heartening him in the trade.</P>
<P>As to the proof of the pannel's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the goods;
no other rule can well be laid down but this, that the
thing mu&s;t be found in &s;uch circum&s;tances, from which
it is pre&s;umable that it was not put there by &s;ervants or
others without his knowledge, but by him&s;elf, or with his
privity and connivance.<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 11. &amp; 15. 173$.</NOTE> In the ca&s;e of John and Eliza|beth
Bell, the jury found a certain theft proved, &startq;and that
part of the goods &s;o &s;tolen were found in the repo&s;itories

<P>2. IT does not &s;eem to be a nece&s;&s;ary circum&s;tance of the
crime,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mu&s;t the Re&s;et|ter receive di|rectly from the Thief.</NOTE> that the thing have pa&s;&s;ed immediately from the
hands of the thief, into tho&s;e of the re&s;etter. When the
<PB N="156" REF="215">
pro&s;ecutor has proved the finding of the goods in the
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the culprit, and in &s;uch circum&s;tances as pre|&s;ume
his knowledge of their theftuous quality, he has then
made out his ca&s;e. And when the pannel &s;hows in exculpa|tion,
that he had them not from the thief him&s;elf, but from
another per&s;on, he &s;till has not a relevant defence, unle&s;s
he at the &s;ame time &s;how that he got them upon &s;uch a bar|gain,
or from &s;uch a per&s;on, and on the whole in &s;uch a
manner, as outweighs the pre&s;umption again&s;t him, and
infers a lawful way of acqui&s;ition. For what if he had them
from &s;ome member of the family of the thief, or from a
confident of his, who got them from him to keep, but find|ing
his hou&s;e un&s;afe, and fearing a &s;earch, conveyed them
to the pannel. If, therefore, in the ca&s;e of repeated chan|ges
of hand, the charge of re&s;et is apt to fail, it is not be|cau&s;e
it is incompetent in the&s;e circum&s;tances, but by rea&s;on
of the difficulty of the proof, and of the weaker grounds of
&s;u&s;picion, generally &s;peaking, which that &s;ituation affords.</P>
<P>3. THE po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be &s;et forth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Re&s;etter mu&s;t know that they are &s;tolen Goods.</NOTE> as that which is held in
the knowledge of the vicious quality of the thing; where|in
lies the entire wrong of the act, and the &s;ub&s;tance of the
charge. Bare &s;u&s;picion, therefore, of the fact, or that the
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or had rea&s;onable cau&s;e to doubt whether his author
had acquired the things lawfully, is no relevant ground of
conviction of this crime: becau&s;e in &s;uch matters the at|tention
and &s;agacity of one man is &s;o different from that of
another; and though a per&s;on may be blameable, he is not,
however, to be puni&s;hed, on account of pure heedle&s;&s;ne&s;s
or indi&s;cretion.</P>
<P>To require,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Way of proving his Knowledge.</NOTE> however, that the re&s;etter's knowledge of the
quality of the things &s;hall be proved by direct te&s;timony
<PB N="157" REF="216">
to the di&s;clo&s;ure of the theft to him, would be little le&s;s than
to &s;ecure him of impunity; becau&s;e ordinarily, from the
very nature of the &s;ituation, no &s;uch evidence is to be had:
nay, from the jealou&s;y and caution &s;o natural to people of
this &s;ort, it will often happen, that no expre&s;s communi|cation
ever takes place on the &s;ubject. The common and
relevant mode of proof is therefore by circum&s;tances of
real evidence; &s;uch as the concealment of the goods in
hidden places, the denial of them to the officers of ju&s;tice
upon their &s;earch, the attempt to di&s;gui&s;e them by altera|tion
or effacing of marks, the low price paid for them, the
incon&s;i&s;tent accounts given of the manner of getting them,
and the quality of the goods them&s;elves, being &s;uch as tho&s;e
from whom they were got could not hone&s;tly have obtain|ed:
of all which it is a powerful confirmation, if the pan|nel
him&s;elf or his author, is of evil fame as a re&s;etter or

This I &s;hall illu&s;trate by the ca&s;e of Ander&s;on and Mar&s;hall.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 25. and Dec. 3. 4. 1728.</NOTE>
Ander&s;on was a vagabond or gyp&s;ey. Mar&s;hall kept a hou&s;e
of re&s;ort for vagabonds. And both were charged as art and
part of a robbery committed on Bailie Rule, early in the
morning, upon the highway near Mar&s;hall's hou&s;e. It
appeared that Ander&s;on and other gyp&s;ies were lodged in
Mar&s;hall's barn on the night of the robbery, and that Mar|&s;hall
knew of Rule's intention to pa&s;s that way with a &s;um
of money, and communicated this to Ander&s;on. Ander&s;on
ro&s;e in the night from among his comrades, then a&s;leep in the
barn, &s;tepped out at a window, almo&s;t naked, and having rob|bed
Rule a &s;hort way off, returned to his quarters; where he
threw in his &s;taff at the window. At this moment, tho&s;e with|in
heard Ander&s;on in conver&s;ation with Mar&s;hall; Ander&s;on
de&s;iring him to take care of the money, and Mar&s;hall a&s;&s;u|ring
him, &startq;that it was as &s;afe as his &s;hirt.&endq; The&s;e were the
chief features of the ca&s;e; upon which the Court found it
relevant to infer death and confi&s;cation of moveables again&s;t
Mar&s;hall, &startq;his having been guilty, art and part, of the fore|&s;aid
robbery, by outhounding, re&s;etting, or ratihabiting

guilt of theft or of re&s;et, Now, as to this; in every ca&s;e,
<PB N="161" REF="220">
the whole circum&s;tances of the fact are to be weighed. But
in general, if there be nothing farther to elucidate, the mat|ter,
and more e&s;pecially with re&s;pect to tho&s;e ca&s;es, where
the time and place of finding are not remote from the time
and place of theft, &s;o as to give countenance to the belief
of a change of hands; there &s;eems to be no ground in law
for pre&s;uming that the pannel has the thing as re&s;etter, ra|ther
than as thief. Or rather there &s;eems to be rea&s;on for pre|&s;uming
the other way; becau&s;e if he truly got the thing
from another per&s;on, he has it in his power to &s;how this;
and with him, in the&s;e circum&s;tances, the burden naturally
lies of proving this, or any other defence, that is exclu&s;ive
of the charge of theft. On this ground judgment &s;eems to
have gone in the ca&s;e of Murdi&s;on and Miller,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maclaurin, No. 89.</NOTE> in which the
verdict was con&s;idered by the Court as a &s;pecial <HI>finding</HI> of

find too, that in &s;eveval of the older pleadings, the two of|fences
are cur&s;orily &s;poken of, as being of the &s;ame degree,

<P>YET I cannot di&s;cover,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Re&s;et, how pu|ni&s;hable.</NOTE> that in any one in&s;tance, judg|ment

not only &s;o; but &s;undry ca&s;es are to be found where the
di&s;tinction is made between the thief and the re&s;etter,
by inflicting death on the one, and only arbitrary pain on
the other.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 11. 1714.</NOTE> This, was done in the ca&s;e of Tennant, who
had &s;entence of bani&s;hment and infamy, for re&s;etting the
goods in his hou&s;e, which Hutchie&s;on and Macdougal were,
upon the &s;ame libel, condemned to die for &s;tealing. The
like rule of judgment was followed in the ca&s;e of Archibald
Stewart and Charles Gordon:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 14. 1785.</NOTE> For Stewart had &s;entence of
death, being convicted of two acts of hou&s;e-breaking; and
Gordon, convicted of re&s;etting the articles, and to a great va|lue,
carried off from one of the&s;e hou&s;es, was &s;courged, and
tran&s;ported for &s;even years. It is to be ob&s;erved too of
both ca&s;es, that the re&s;et was in the cour&s;e of the &s;ame night
In which the things were &s;tolen. A &s;till &s;tronger in&s;tance
occurred in a trial at Jedburgh, before the Lords Hailes
and Henderland, in September 1786. This verdict was re|turned
again&s;t John Clerk and Thomas Martin, indicted for
<PB N="163" REF="222">

and James Thorburn.&endq;</HI> Now, on this verdict, which,
as to Martin, is a conviction of four acts of re&s;etting &s;tolen
goods of &s;ome value, that pannel had &s;entence to be &s;courged
and tran&s;ported, at the &s;ame time that Clerk, the thief, had
&s;entence of death.</P>
<P>IT is a confirmation on the &s;ame &s;ide, that in the ca&s;e of Mur|di&s;on
and Miller,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maclaurin, No. 89.</NOTE> the opinions of the Judges a&s;&s;ume and im|ply,
though they do not directly lay it down, that re&s;et of
theft, and even repeated re&s;et, (for &s;uch in this ca&s;e it would
have been), is the lower crime, and only liable to arbitrary
pain. Moreover, notice may be taken of the &s;tatute 1587,
c. 110. touching <HI>the &s;ellers of gudes pertaining to malefactors,</HI>
which puni&s;hes tho&s;e offenders, who &s;eem to be at lea&s;t a-kin
to re&s;etters, with bani&s;hment only and confi&s;cation of move|ables.
Taken together, the&s;e things con&s;pire to beget a doubt,
whether, for proper re&s;et, and although guilty of repeated
acts, a per&s;on may warrantably be puni&s;hed with death; and
whether tho&s;e authorities, which may be alleged on the other
&s;ide, are not rather to be under&s;tood as applicable to &s;uch

pernicious than the other, which it &s;o much forwards and
encourages, yet there is a material difference of boldne&s;s

the mere keeping of things which have already been taken
away<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">On the 4th March 1751, Richard Begbic, convicted of three acts of re&s;et, on his own confe&s;&s;ion, was &s;ent to the correction-hou&s;e for three months, and ba|ni&s;hed Scotland.</NOTE>. That the highe&s;t arbitrary pain may be inflicted,
is not the &s;ubject of di&s;pute.</P>

are attended with aggravations. For whether the aggrava|tion
be by the habite and repute, or the repeated guilt of the

particular act, the&s;e are qualities which affect the thief only,
and not the re&s;etter; who&s;e act of detaining the &s;tolen goods

certain modifications, as relative to the ca&s;e of the principal

carries the plea no farther, and the Ju&s;tice a&s;&s;igns his rea&s;on

if known and in cu&s;tody, was in the fir&s;t place to be brought
to trial; and if not in cu&s;tody, was to be outlawed for non|compearance.
But that if the thief were unknown, or were
dead, or were abroad, or could not be taken, the re&s;etter was
to e&s;cape unpuni&s;hed; this would not have been rea&s;onable

lay the libel with an alternative charge of theft and re&s;et,

<P>The libel begins thus; &startq;That where by the laws of this and all other well governed realms, all riots, and violent inva&s;ion of property of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and atrocious real injuries, &s;uch as the pulling or beating down with axes, ham|mers, or &s;uch other like in&s;truments, the &s;eats and lofts in churches belonging to any of our &s;ubjects, or decorements put upon them for the decent adorning of the &s;aid &s;eats, lofts, or churches, in a riotous, ma&s;terful, and lawle&s;s manner, by a&s;&s;embling any number of per&s;ons together, armed with the in&s;truments a|fore&s;aid, which might have occa&s;ioned tumults and great di&s;orders, and had fatal con&s;equences, are crimes of a high nature,&endq; <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>It appears, that the act which gave occa&s;ion to this libel, was the pulling down of a Dorick pila&s;ter in Lord Sommerville's &s;eat, which, as Mortonhall alleged, en|croached upon his &s;eat. It was aggravated, in being done a day or two before the di&s;pen&s;ation of the &s;acrament.</P></NOTE>. The pur&s;uer had a favour|able<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 25. and Aug. 4. 1730.</NOTE>
<PB N="171" REF="230">
verdict; and the pannel paid L. 100, of fine, damages,
and expences.</P>
<P>THESE may &s;erve as a &s;pecimen of the cour&s;e of practice
in times pa&s;t, (for of late years the civil courts have more
commonly been re&s;orted to for redre&s;s of &s;uch injuries),
with re&s;pect to violent or tumultuous mole&s;tation, intru&s;ion,
or inva&s;ion of property.</P>
<P>UPON the whole of them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grounds of Re|levancy in &s;uch Ca&s;es.</NOTE> the&s;e things &s;eem to be ob&s;er|vable.
1. It will not acquit the pannel, that there is a con|trover&s;y
between him and the pur&s;uer concerning the mat|ter
of patrimonial right, (as happened in every one of the
in&s;tances which have been quoted,) and that he proceeded
in the belief of a civil wrong, previou&s;ly committed by
that per&s;on again&s;t him. For he is not excu&s;able in forgetting
that the courts of law are open to his complaint. 2. It is
grounded in the &s;ame rea&s;on, namely, the due regard to the
order and tranquillity of Society, that the pannel &s;hall
equally be convicted, whether it be that he interferes with
the property of another, or only with his &s;tate of peaceable
and lawful-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. For neither is this to be broken but by
the order of law. This rule e&s;pecially appears upon the terms
of the interlocutor in the ca&s;e of Monro. 3. That which law
in &s;uch debates chiefly regards, is not &s;o much the patri|monial
damage &s;u&s;tained, (which in mo&s;t of the&s;e in&s;tances
<PB N="172" REF="231">
was but trifling,) as the in&s;ult both to the public and the in|dividual,
by the violence and tumult with which the thing
is done. Hence, on occa&s;ion of the above controver&s;y be|tween
Rigg and Trotter, the latter having recriminated, un|der
the pretence that Rigg had rai&s;ed the turf for his bow|ling-green
from a &s;pot of land which belonged to Trotter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 15. 1714.</NOTE>
but without &s;pecifying any circum&s;tance of violence or di&s;|order;
this was held to re&s;olve into a que&s;tion of tre&s;pa&s;s,
or controverted marches, and to be no relevant ground of
a criminal charge. In like manner, upon a libel again&s;t Sir
James Dunbar and others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 2. 11. 1714.</NOTE> which bears a charge of &s;undry
u&s;urpations and iniquities committed by the pannels, one
article is di&s;mi&s;&s;ed for this rea&s;on, that no qualification of
violence is &s;et forth<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">&startq;As al&s;o, find the &s;econd article, <HI>viz.</HI> That For&s;yth did by him&s;elf, or by order of Sir James Dunbar, po&s;&s;e&s;s a part of the lands &s;et to the pur&s;uer, and wherein the pur&s;uer had been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, not relevant in a criminal proce&s;s, <HI>no violence being libelled,</HI> without prejudice of any civil action as accords.&endq;</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS limitation is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Poi&s;oning of cattle, &s;heep, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> however, only applicable to the ca&s;e
of incon&s;iderable injuries to property, or to &s;uch as may
have been done by the pannel under the mi&s;apprehen&s;ion of
right. For if any one go and poi&s;on his neighbour's dogs,
&s;heep, or cattle, or mangle them by cutting out their tongues,
breaking their limbs, or the like, certainly this is a crime,
and puni&s;hable with &s;evere pains, though he proceed ever &s;o
&s;ecretly in the execution of his wrongful and malicious
purpo&s;e. Nay, I find that for the poi&s;oning of poultry,
Thomas Bellie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 5. 1600.</NOTE> burge&s;s of Brechin, came in the King's will,
and was bani&s;hed under pain of death; having mixed
ar&s;enic with dough, and thrown it down in the court-yard
of his neighbour, Janet Clerk, to poi&s;on her fowls; whereby
&s;ome of them were killed.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="232">
THIS judgment proceeded on the common law. But in
certain in&s;tances of wilful mi&s;chief, which are more alarm|ing
by the high damage which attends them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Houghing of cattle, breaking of ploughs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> or by their
frequency, and the ea&s;e with which they may be done, it
has been thought proper to &s;trengthen the protection of the
common law, and to deter the malicious by the dread of a
higher and &s;tatutory pain. This is true of the breaking or
de&s;troying of ploughs, or plough-gear, in time of tilth; of
the killing, goring, or houghing of oxen, hor&s;es, or other
cattle, at the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on, or in time of harve&s;t-labour; and
of the breaking and de&s;troying of mills; all of which of|fences
are,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1581, c 110. 1587, c. 83.</NOTE> by the&s;e &s;tatutes, puni&s;hable as theft, and with
the pains of death. The phra&s;e of &startq;uther cattel,&endq; which
is u&s;ed in the fir&s;t of the&s;e laws, was, in one in&s;tance, ap|plied
to the killing of &s;heep;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 20. 1616.</NOTE> and three per&s;ons, George, Wal|ter,
and Ingram Scott, were, in con&s;equence, condemned to
die. But it may be doubted, whether this is a found con|&s;truction
of that &s;tatute, which, even with re&s;pect to the
kinds that are expre&s;sly mentioned in it, &s;eems only to be
applicable to the &s;ea&s;ons of labour. Other &s;tatutes, which
make the like provi&s;ions as to the killing of game, the cut|ting
of trees, the breaking of dovecotes, and the like, were
formerly taken notice of under the head of theft.</P>
<P>II. BUT by far the mo&s;t important article which falls under
the general head of malicious mi&s;chief,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of wilful Fire-rai&s;ing.</NOTE> is the crime of wilful
fire-rai&s;ing; to which I have a&s;&s;igned a place in this Chapter,
as ordinarily intended to do a patrimonial injury, though it
may be, and &s;ometimes, but more rarely, hath been direc|ted
again&s;t life and per&s;on too. Take it in any view, it is
always a crime of the fir&s;t degree; on account of the dread|ful
and exten&s;ive wa&s;te it may occa&s;ion, the great terror and
<PB N="174" REF="233">
alarm which attend it, the impo&s;&s;ibility of guarding again&s;t
it, and the pure and deliberate malice of the contrivance
and way of execution.</P>
<P>THE laws of all countries have therefore con&s;ented in
dooming the fire-rai&s;er to death;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pains of Fire-rai&s;ing.</NOTE> as well as tho&s;e of &s;everal
have ordered him to peri&s;h in &s;ome uncommon and more
cruel mode of execution. The Roman law, if he were a per&s;on
of low condition, allowed him to be expo&s;ed to wild bea&s;ts;
and in certain other ca&s;es, &startq;<HI>igni necari jubetur</HI><NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">L. 9. et 12. dig. De Incendio, &amp;c. L. 28. No. 12. dig. De Poenis.</NOTE>.&endq; This
&s;ort of retaliation was al&s;o adopted in the laws of the Vi&s;i|goths,
and of &s;ome others of the barbarous nations; with re|&s;pect
to him at lea&s;t who rai&s;ed fire within a town or village.
The &s;ame law was proclaimed for the German empire, by a
con&s;titution of Charles V.; and, as Carp&s;ovius &s;ays, it was
the general rule of his time in Saxony, for fire-rai&s;ers of eve|ry
degree and condition<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Leg. Vi&s;ig. lib. 8. tit. 2. No. 1. Carp&s;ov. quae&s;t. p. 225.</NOTE>, &startq;<HI>igne cremandos e&s;&s;e.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>WITH us in Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pains of Fire-rai&s;ing.</NOTE> we find that the <HI>Regiam Maje&s;tatem,</HI>
likened the crime of fire-rai&s;ing to that of murder, and or|dered
that it &s;hould in all points be proceeded in,<NOTE PLACE="marg">B. 4. c. 6.</NOTE> treated, and
brought to i&s;&s;ue as &s;uch. But not content with this &s;everity,
which had proved in&s;ufficient in tho&s;e di&s;orderly times, the
Legi&s;lature, fir&s;t by &s;tatute 1426, c. 75. and afterwards, more
fully, by &s;tatute 1528, c. 8. rai&s;ed the crime of fire-rai&s;ing, at
lea&s;t in certain ca&s;es, to the rank of trea&s;on. &startq;The auld
lawes, (it &s;ays), &s;hall be keeped with this addition, that

<PB N="175" REF="234">
burninges of hou&s;es and cornes, and wilfull fire-rai&s;ings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">FIRERAISING.</NOTE>
be trea&s;on, and crime of le&s;e maje&s;tie.&endq;</P>
<P>OWING,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pains of Fire-rai&s;ing.</NOTE> either to inadvertency, or to &s;ome rea&s;on which
cannot now be a&s;&s;igned, this act was not printed in the
Black Acts, or fir&s;t edition of our &s;tatutes; which omi&s;&s;ion to
&s;upply, &s;pecial order was given to print it, by the &s;tatute
1567, c. 32. And thus it happens, that in all the later editions,
this law is found in&s;erted both in its proper place, as a &s;ta|tute
of the year 1528, and al&s;o as a renewed act of the year
1567, being the act immediately following that which gives
order for the printing. But in this renewed form, the law
is inaccurately given, both as being referred to the year 1526,
in which there was no Parliament, and by the omi&s;&s;ion of
the words &startq;and all burninges of hou&s;es;&endq; whereby the &s;en&s;e
of the enactment is maimed and confounded. This is the
more material to be taken notice of, as Mackenzie in what
he &s;ays of this crime, having attended only to the renewed,
and not to the genuine &s;tatute, has been led into difficulties,
and indeed mi&s;takes, re&s;pecting the extent and application
of the law.</P>
<P>BESIDE the&s;e two, there is an intermediate &s;tatute, the
act 1540. c. 118., which chiefly relates to the burning of corn
in &s;tacks or barns, and on the whole &s;eems to have been in|tended,
not for taking away the pains of trea&s;on formerly
ordained, (as Lord Roy&s;ton &s;uppo&s;ed), but for di&s;abling the
King to pardon the offenders in this &s;ort, or even to com|mute
the lawful pains of their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion for any thing
le&s;s than bani&s;hment<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Roy&s;ton's Notes, No. 10. tit. Fire-rai&s;ing.</NOTE>. It is not clear, that this was even
meant to be a perpetual law; and we know, that it was no
better ob&s;erved than tho&s;e other &s;tatutes which made the
<PB N="176" REF="235">
like provi&s;ions with re&s;pect to murder, and other acts of
violence to which tho&s;e times were addicted.</P>
<P>THE pains of trea&s;on were afterwards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pains of Fire-rai&s;ing.</NOTE> by &s;tatute 1592,
c. 148. extended to the burning of coal-heughs. But by the
act of the 7th Anne, c. 21. the la&s;t which relates to the
pains of this offence, and the &s;ame which extends the Eng|li&s;h
trea&s;on-law to Scotland, fire-rai&s;ing, in all the in&s;tances
which had been rai&s;ed to the rank of trea&s;on, was again
lowered to the ordinary condition of a capital offence, and
was ordered to be proceeded in and tried as &s;uch.</P>
<P>So &s;tanding the law as to the puni&s;hment of fire-rai&s;ing,
let us next attend to the character and lawful de&s;cription of
the crime.</P>
<P>1. WE have to remark the di&s;tinction between the pro|per
and capital crime of fire-rai&s;ing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crime requires actual burning.</NOTE> and the attempt to
commit it; which lies in this, that the fire mu&s;t not only be
applied, but applied with &s;ucce&s;s, to that which is meant to
be de&s;troyed. Though our opinion of the offender may be
the &s;ame, it is not however &s;ufficient authority in law for
pa&s;&s;ing &s;entence of death on him, that he has taken the la&s;t
&s;tep, and done his utmo&s;t towards the perpetration of his
wickedne&s;s, as by kindling his matches, and to&s;&s;ing them
among the corn, or upon the roof of the hou&s;e; if in fact
his de&s;tructive purpo&s;e has not been accompli&s;hed. Probab|ly
it was on this account, that no &s;entence followed in the
ca&s;e of Barbara Phinnick,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 28. and July 8. 1670.</NOTE> who, as appears from the proof,
being left alone in her ma&s;ter's hou&s;e, had torn a bed-quilt,
and placed it under a bed, with a burning candle in the
middle of it, and had then gone abroad and locked the
doors, with intent certainly to de&s;troy the hou&s;e: but which
<PB N="177" REF="236">
purpo&s;e failed to take effect, neither the bed being &s;et fire
to, (owing to a bed-tick of leather), nor even the bed-quilt
being quite con&s;umed, and the boards of the floor only be|ginning
to be touched, when the di&s;covery was made<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The jury however found her guilty &startq;of rai&s;ing of fire within the hou&s;e of James Stamfield.&endq;.</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT this rule equally requires to be guarded on the other
&s;ide:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burning of any Part is &s;ufficient.</NOTE> for we &s;hould form a very fal&s;e, and no le&s;s unrea&s;on|able
notion of the law, if we &s;hould conceive that there is no
fire-rai&s;ing without the ab&s;olute and complete de&s;truction of
the thing or tenement, to which the fire is put. Certainly
the crime is as much committed, if one &s;tack in the barn|yard,
or any di&s;tinct portion of the hou&s;e is de&s;troyed, as if
the whole were con&s;umed, according to the pannel's in|tention.

to confirm it), is announced in the interlocutor in the

<P>Now,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proof of the wilful purpo&s;e.</NOTE> the pro&s;ecutor has peculiar difficulties to contend
with, in proving this the fundamental article of his charge.
In mo&s;t ca&s;es of theft, murder, malicious mi&s;chief and the
like, the crime leaves &s;uch ve&s;tiges behind it, as upon
the fir&s;t view betray the felony which has been committed.
The &s;ame is not true of fire-rai&s;ing: On the contrary, the out|ward
&s;pectacle of a wilful, and of an accidental fire, is quite
the &s;ame; and indeed the more complete the &s;ucce&s;s of the
felony, the more thoroughly all the means of detecting it
are de&s;troyed. Excepting, therefore, in tho&s;e rare ca&s;es,
where direct te&s;timony can be obtained to the very act of &s;et|ting
fire, the pro&s;ecutor has to &s;urmount this ob&s;tacle, as he
be&s;t may, by convincing arguments and pre&s;umptions, drawn
from the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e. It is an article of that
tendency, that fire breaks out &s;uddenly in a hou&s;e which is
not inhabited, or in remote parts of a building at the &s;ame
time, or that combu&s;tibles are found &s;trewed in or about the
premi&s;&s;es. But it were vain to attempt any enumeration of
the particulars which may be &s;erviceable in that re&s;pect, or
to think of laying down any rule for their &s;ufficiency, other
than this obvious and general direction, that the proofs and
tokens mu&s;t be pregnant to prevail again&s;t the pannel, who
in this, as in other ca&s;es, has the pre&s;umption of innocence
in his favour. Barely to &s;ay that it is not ea&s;y to imagine,
<PB N="180" REF="239">
by what other than wilful means the fire could happen, will
not, without &s;ome farther indication, be &s;ufficient; &s;o many
are the &s;trange accidents, and trifling indi&s;cretions by which
mi&s;chief of this &s;ort may be occa&s;ioned. On that ground, in
the ca&s;e of John Ker,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 13. 1792.</NOTE> the jury found a verdict for the pannel.</P>
<P>SIR GEORGE MACKENZIE,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proof of the wilful purpo&s;e.</NOTE> in his chapter concerning this
crime<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">No. 2.</NOTE>, &s;eems di&s;po&s;ed even to go a greater length, and to
require a proof of the <HI>corpus delicti</HI> by direct te&s;timony, or by
confe&s;&s;ion of party, to the ab&s;olute exclu&s;ion of pre&s;umption.
But as this pa&s;&s;age is introduced with mention of the ca&s;e
of John Meldrum, tried in Augu&s;t 1633, the meaning may
only be, and in this he is &s;urely right, to exclude tho&s;e vague
and inconclu&s;ive pre&s;umptions of common fame, previous
enmity, threats of mi&s;chief, and the like, which &s;eem in
that ca&s;e to have been the chief grounds of conviction.
The charge again&s;t Meldrum was for burning the tower of
Frendraught, &startq;of the height (the libel &s;ays), of four hou&s;e
high,&endq; and in which peri&s;hed the Vi&s;count Melgum, &s;on
of the Marquis of Huntly, the laird of Rothiemay, and four
of their &s;ervants, all of them gue&s;ts at the time with the laird
of Frendraught. Meldrum&punc; had once been an inmate of
the hou&s;e; and the manner of the fire was &s;uppo&s;ed to be by
his to&s;&s;ing combu&s;tibles into a vault at the bottom of the
tower, &startq;through the &s;lits and &s;cores of the vault,&endq; whence
the flame communicated upwards, through a &s;quare aper|ture,
or hole in the arch of the vault, and cou&s;umed the
whole of this high tower. This was, however, nothing bet|ter
than a hypothe&s;is, un&s;upported by any pointed proof
with re&s;pect to the manner in which the fire began; and
though the man may have been guilty, I mu&s;t agree with Mac|kenzie
in thinking it doubtful, whether there was legal evi|dence
<PB N="181" REF="240">
to convict him. A per&s;on named John To&s;hoch, a
&s;ervant in the tower, and an alleged accomplice of Mel|drum's,
was indicted in the &s;ucceeding year; but as he had
previou&s;ly been put to the torture, which he &s;u&s;tained without
confe&s;&s;ing, and as no farther evidence had after this time
been obtained again&s;t him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 22. 1634.</NOTE> the Court, in the&s;e circum&s;tances,
refu&s;ed to remit him to an a&s;&s;ize.</P>
<P>WHERE the&s;e qualities concur,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;e of a Thing burned, by fire &s;et to another.</NOTE> it will not materially
affect the ca&s;e, what the mode of executing the mi&s;chief
be: Whether it be done by one per&s;on or by a mob, (as
was re&s;olved in the ca&s;e of William Spence);<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 13. 1784.</NOTE> whether
the pannel kindle the fire with his own hand, or by that
of others whom he procures or equips for the enter|pri&s;e;
or whether he apply the fire directly to the thing or
tenement which is meant to be de&s;troyed, or to &s;omething
contained in or nearly connected with it, &s;o that the one
being on fire, the other is likely to kindle. If the pan|nel,
thinking to cheat the law, &s;hall not ca&s;t fire into
the corn, but into the dry furze in the middle of the field,
or immediately bounding it, or if he kindle a &s;tack of
feuel adjoining to the barn-yard, or &s;et fire to the goods
or furniture in the ware-hou&s;e, he &s;hall &s;till be judged
as a fire-rai&s;er, if his purpo&s;e take effect, by fa&s;tening
upon or con&s;uming any part of the corn or of the build|ing;
for it is all one, as if he had laid and kindled a
train of gun-powder with the &s;ame intent. The charge was
accordingly found relevant in a ca&s;e of this de&s;cription, that
of James Douglas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 4. &amp; 10. 1682.</NOTE> who having broken into a writer's cham|ber
and &s;tolen, wilfully placed a burning candle among the
papers in a pre&s;s or de&s;k, (thinking to conceal his theft);
<PB N="182" REF="241">
whereby the hou&s;e was &s;et fire to and burned<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">He e&s;caped conviction, owing to a defect and irregularity in the way of pro|ving his confe&s;&s;ion.</NOTE>. Nay, a$
little &s;hall he have any defence, though the thing which he
&s;ets fire to be even his own property, if it be &s;o &s;ituated
that the &s;afety of his neighbour's property depends on it,
(being, for in&s;tance, floors of the &s;ame tenement, or being
contiguous and connected buildings), and if any part of his
neighbour's property is in con&s;equence con&s;umed. Certain|ly,
by how much more &s;uch a deed &s;hows a rooted and inve|terate
malice again&s;t his neighbour, by &s;o much more is it
de&s;erving of the highe&s;t pains of law.</P>
<P>IN the&s;e in&s;tances,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;e of Thing burned by fire &s;et to another.</NOTE> I have &s;uppo&s;ed the pannel to have had a
purpo&s;e from the fir&s;t, again&s;t the very &s;ubject which has in the
event been de&s;troyed. But even this may not in every ca&s;e be
nece&s;&s;ary. It is the general rule which governs in the con|&s;truction
of other offences, and will equally apply here,
that the malefactor who is actuated by a malicious purpo&s;e
again&s;t his neighbour, and has meant to do him a great and fe|lonious
mi&s;chief, &s;hall be accountable for all the con&s;equences
of his act; at lea&s;t, if they are not of quite a fortuitous and
extraordinary nature, but &s;uch as might naturally, and not
improbably en&s;ue on his enterpri&s;e. If, therefore, any one
&s;et fire to his neighbour's cop&s;e-wood, or heath, or mo&s;s,
with intent only to de&s;troy that &s;ubject, (in which he does
not commit a capital offence), but the fire gets head, and
con&s;umes corn and hou&s;es, and all that is in the way, he
&s;hall be puni&s;hed in the &s;ame degree, as if he had intended all
this ravage from the fir&s;t. He &s;howed a high dole, a de|praved
and wicked purpo&s;e again&s;t his neighbour, in the im|mediate
<PB N="183" REF="242">
thing he did; that which has followed is a mi&s;|chief,
though higher, of the very &s;ame fort with that which
he intended, and &s;o likely to follow on it, that, when he did
the other, he mu&s;t have been utterly indifferent to his
neighbour's intere&s;t and &s;afety, whether this mi&s;chief al&s;o
&s;hould en&s;ue or not: So that the fir&s;t purpo&s;e in &s;uch a
ca&s;e naturally connects with the event, and completes the
capital offence. I &s;hall put another ca&s;e in illu&s;tration. If
a mob break into a man's hou&s;e, and pull his effects to
pieces, and afterwards, the more effectually to de&s;troy them,
proceed to pile them up in front of the hou&s;e, and there
to burn the heap, by which the hou&s;e it&s;elf is &s;et fire to and
con&s;umed; this, without a doubt, is fire-rai&s;ing, though it
happen beyond their fir&s;t intent.</P>
<P>AND here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Object of the Fire rai&s;ing not material,</NOTE> though not &s;trictly in the order of our arrange|ment,
I am naturally led on to ob&s;erve with re&s;pect to the
offender's purpo&s;e, that if it was to burn the thing which has
been con&s;umed, the crime will not the le&s;s be fire-rai&s;ing, that
the doing of this particular mi&s;chief was not the ultimate, nor
&s;ole, nor even chief purpo&s;e of his enterpri&s;e. If a mob a&s;&s;ault
a gaol, to re&s;cue rioters who are confined there, and they
burn down the doors, pa&s;&s;ages, and inner &s;trengths of the
gaol, to obtain entry of the building; and of its &s;everal parts,
this &s;eems alike to be fire-rai&s;ing, (and may he maintained
to be &s;o, even though they them&s;elves &s;hould in the end extin|gui&s;h
the fire), as if they had no other object in coming there.
It is &s;till true that fire has been wilfully, maliciou&s;ly, and felo|niou&s;ly,
not ca&s;ually, excu&s;ably, or culpably rai&s;ed within this
gaol, and that part of the &s;ame has thereby been con&s;umed;
and the ca&s;e is only &s;o much the wor&s;e for the pannels, if this
act has been &s;ub&s;ervient to the al&s;o unlawful, and felonious
<PB N="184" REF="243">
tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of mobbing, breaking gaol, and &s;etting pri|&s;oners
at large. Or put the ca&s;e, that a toll-hou&s;e is inva|ded,
and partly burned by a mob, with the purpo&s;e of hin|dering
the collection of the toll. It cannot be imagined that
the fire-rai&s;ing cea&s;es to be &s;uch, becau&s;e it is the u&s;eful,
or the nece&s;&s;ary in&s;trument, towards that farther, and al&s;o
criminal object. In the ca&s;e of Maclauchlane, tried as ac|ce&s;&s;ory
to the outrages committed by the Porteous mob, one
of which was the burning the doors of the gaol,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maclaurin, No. 93.</NOTE> to gain
admittance to their victim, this of fire-rai&s;ing was according|ly
libelled, among other denominations of crime. But whe|ther
the charge was meant to be &s;u&s;tained under that form,
cannot be &s;aid upon the general terms in which the interlocu|tor
is expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>IT remains to enquire concerning the things or &s;ubjects,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What Fire-rai|&s;ings puni&s;hable with Death.</NOTE>
on which the capital crime of fire-rai&s;ing may be committed.
There can be no que&s;tion with re&s;pect to tho&s;e &s;ubjects, name|ly,
hou&s;es, corn, and coal-heughs, which are &s;pecially men|tioned
in the &s;tatutes 1528, 1540, and 1592. And the&s;e, for
obvious rea&s;ons, are certainly the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions which mo&s;t re|quire
to be guarded from this &s;ort of injury. Neither can
I find that any. judgment has extended the de&s;cription of
the crime beyond the&s;e articles, &s;o as to affix the &s;ame pains
to the burning of woods, heaths, mo&s;&s;es, &s;tacks of feuel<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Mackenzie, No. 5. &s;ays, That in the ca&s;e of Suddie, the Ju&s;tices refu&s;ed to &s;u&s;tain the burning of &s;ome feuel in a muir as trea&s;on.

or in general any &s;ort of moveable effects. Whatever may
be true as to other modes of charge, it would not therefore
be capital as fire-rai&s;ing, that a mob, after riffling a hou&s;e,
collect the effects and burn them in the &s;treet; nor even
within the hou&s;e, that they burn the owner's title-deeds,
bank-notes and bonds, or other valuable papers and preci|ous
effects, gathered into a heap in the fire-place, or upon
the hearth.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect however to corn;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burning of Corn is capital.</NOTE> this &s;ubject, according to
the &s;tatutes 1528 and 1540, is equally protected by the
highe&s;t pains, whether it be in the field, or gathered into the

him&s;elf, in&s;tructs that &s;he was in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Tayn|lone,
it bearing that the rents of the&s;e lands were counted
upon. So that <HI>albeit the property of Taynlone did belong to
the pannel, yet if he or any other heritor &s;hould &s;et fire to hou&s;es
po&s;&s;e&s;t by tenants,</HI> it would unque&s;tionably be wilful fire|rai&s;ing;
and therefore this point needs not be further di&s;|puted.&endq;
The Lords find upon this debate, &startq;That the
hou&s;e or hou&s;es of Taynlone, <HI>&s;aid to be liferented</HI> by Jean
Dougal complainer, were upon one or other of the days

<HI>&s;et fire to the &s;aid hou&s;e,</HI> whereby, the &s;ame, or the

<P>THIS ca&s;e was even thus far favourable to the pan|nel,
that no per&s;on was dwelling in the hou&s;e, to be

able to him; which is, that the tenant or liferenter is
not even in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by having his effects in the hou&s;e, and
thus &s;uffers no lo&s;s but that of his real intere&s;t, which is
then only like that of a real creditor or adjudger of a &s;ub|ject,
which remains in the natural occupation of the owner.
But I am now &s;tating a ca&s;e which has never yet been
tried.</P>
<P>A THIRD,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;e of a Man burning his own Hou&s;e.</NOTE> and &s;till more unlikely &s;ituation is, if a per&s;on
&s;hall burn his own hou&s;e, being either unoccupied at the

be de&s;troyed, and if this be &s;o &s;ituated as not even to be at|tended
with any ri&s;k of damage to the property of others
in the burning of it, and if it be &s;et fire to withall, (if &s;uch a
thing could happen), for &s;port only, and without any &s;ort
of malicious intention, this &s;eems not only not to be the
crime of fire-rai&s;ing, but not to be any crime at all. If it
is a hou&s;e in a town, or is &s;o &s;ituated that any degree of
danger, or of alarm and di&s;turbance to the vicinity, ari&s;es
from the burning of it, the offender &s;hall be liable to puni&s;h|ment,
both in his pur&s;e and otherwi&s;e, as for a high breach
of good neighbourhood and public police.</P>
<P>A MORE unfavourable ca&s;e to the offender,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burning to de|fraud In&s;urers.</NOTE> and of which
it was left to the ingenuity of modern times to introduce us
to the knowledge, is, if he in&s;ure his hou&s;e at a high rate,
and afterwards &s;et fire to it, with intent to injure the under|writers.
Whether this enterpri&s;e &s;ucceed or not, by recove|ry
of the money from the underwriters, and though only the
pannel's own hou&s;e be de&s;troyed; of this there cannot

the wor&s;t kind, and puni&s;hable with the highe&s;t arbitra|ry
<PB N="190" REF="249">
pains. It was found relevant to that effect upon the Lord
Advocate's re&s;triction of his libel, in the ca&s;e of John Ker.
And in the prior ca&s;e of Thomas Muir and James Cant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 13. 1792.</NOTE>
which is our fir&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 16. 1774.</NOTE> and only other ca&s;e of that &s;ort, the
pannels, after &s;ome debate upon the que&s;tion, and in pur|&s;uance
of their own petition, were adjudged to be tran|&s;ported.</P>
<P>BUT in this way the two main controversies &s;till con|tinue
undecided: Fir&s;t, and which is attended with the
greater difficulty, whether &s;uch fraudulent burning of a
per&s;on's own hou&s;e be a capital fire-rai&s;ing: And &s;econdly,
which may &s;eem more probable, whether when a per&s;on,
thus fraudulently &s;ettting fire to his own hou&s;e, happens al&s;o
to burn his neighbour's hou&s;e, or part of it, this is a capital
fire-rai&s;ing, by rea&s;on of the highly criminal and kindred
nature of the original intent. The deci&s;ion of a third and
&s;till nicer que&s;tion was prevented by the re&s;triction of the
libel in the &s;aid ca&s;e of Ker. For the charge again&s;t him
was, that having in&s;ured a tenement of hou&s;es, his pro|perty,
and partly occupied by him&s;elf, partly by tenants,
he, in order to defraud the in&s;urers, had &s;et fire to the part
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by him&s;elf; whereby the whole building, being
all under one roof, and part of his tenants effects along
with it, were con&s;umed. Thus the ca&s;e involved the triple
que&s;tion, of burning his own hou&s;e in the occupation of a
tenant; of burning it by connection only with another po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
by him&s;elf; and of &s;etting fire to that one with intent
only to defraud. With re&s;pect to property in &s;hips, the
doubt has been removed by the late &s;tatute, 29th Geo. III.
c. 46. which makes it a capital offence to burn, or otherwi&s;e
wilfully to de&s;troy, any in&s;ured ve&s;&s;el, with intent to preju|dice
the underwriters, or others concerned.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="250">
THE convictions of fire-rai&s;ing are not very numerous,
and are mo&s;tly of an ancient date.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Convictions of Fire-rai&s;ing</NOTE> On the 13th May 1609,

of death and forfeiture. On the 14th June 1615, John

from any renewal of his wickedne&s;s, may be repre&s;&s;ed by a
&s;uitable and &s;evere correction. Interlocutor was given to

<P>IN this chapter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">FALSEHOOD.</NOTE> we are to have before us a great variety

reducible to the one head of FALSEHOOD, or <HI>crimen fal&s;i;</HI> a
point of criminal accu&s;ation thoroughly e&s;tabli&s;hed in the
Roman law, whence, at a remote period, it had been tran&s;|lated
into that of Scotland. Among the different &s;pecies
of this comprehen&s;ive cla&s;s, let us fir&s;t attend to that &s;ort
of fal&s;ehood, the mo&s;t frequent and the mo&s;t dangerous of
any, which is committed by the fal&s;ification of writings,
and which in the &s;tyle of modern practice, (for it was not

becau&s;e, without frequent reference to the former, the &s;everal
&s;tages and degrees in the fal&s;ification of writings can &s;carce|ly
to any advantage be explained.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="255">
AND, fir&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. V.</NOTE> I &s;hall take up our numerous &s;tatutes concern|ing
fal&s;ehood, which, if clear and deci&s;ive, would relieve
from the trouble of any farther inve&s;tigation. But on look|ing
into the&s;e, of which the following are the chief, 1503,
c. 64.; 1540, c. 80.; 1551, c. 22.; 1621, c. 22.; it will be
found difficult to di&s;cover any certain warrant in them for
inflicting that ultimate puni&s;hment, which is, however, well
known to be the ordinary con&s;equence of the higher &s;pe|cies
of fal&s;ehood. As far as any of the&s;e laws are &s;pe|cial,
they rather afford an argument the other way; in
as much as they enumerate only inferior pains, &s;uch as ba|ni&s;hment,
and di&s;membering of hand or tongue, and, in
their more general expre&s;&s;ions, con&s;i&s;t only of a reference to
the pains of the canon and civil laws. Now, the inflicting
of death was not, in any in&s;tance, within the province of
the &s;piritual courts. Neither does it appear, that in the ci|vil
law, the fal&s;ification of writings, nor indeed any other
&s;ort of fal&s;ehood, was puni&s;hed with this &s;everity, except in
a &s;lave, or in the ca&s;e of fal&s;e coining, which fell under the

kingdom, the pain of death, and the e&s;cheat and con&s;i&s;|cation
<PB N="200" REF="259">
of moveables, are the pains due to the committers
of fal&s;ehood.&endq; The&s;e per&s;ons al&s;o were convicted, and
&s;uffered death. There followed in the &s;ame century, the con|viction
and execution of Dr John Elliot; in January 1694.</P>
<P>NOTICE may farther be taken of the&s;e capital convictions,
of a later date. The ca&s;e of Mungo Strachan and William
Hunter, February 2. and 3. 1708; of Margaret Ni&s;bet, Feb|ruary
1. and 3. 1727; and of George Mackerracher, Februa|ry
19. and 21. 1788; in both of which la&s;t ca&s;es, judgment
was given after debate on the point. Nor are the&s;e to be
pa&s;&s;ed over, in which a capital relevancy was found, though
conviction did not follow: November 19. 1705, John Howie|&s;on;
and Andrew Adam, February 20. 1710.</P>
<P>THESE, too, are exclu&s;ive of the many capital judgments,
in later times, for the forgery of bank-notes, which have
all proceeded on the ground of common law, without aid
of any &s;tatute in that behalf. The following per&s;ons
have had &s;entence of death for that offence: Robert Fle|ming,
February 12. and 19. 1711; John Campbell, March
and April 1731; John Young, November 14. 1750; John
Raybould, January 18. and 19. 1768; William Herries, April
24. 1770; David Reid, Augu&s;t 12. 1780; John Macaffee,
November 1782.</P>
<P>THERE is thus &s;carce any point of our criminal practice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the pains of Forgery.</NOTE>
which re&s;ts upon a longer train of precedents, than this of
capital pain applied to the crime of forgery. But although,
&s;peaking in the general, the competency of this cour&s;e of
judgment will not admit a doubt, it is not, however, meant
to be affirmed, that the Court have therefore an unlimited
di&s;cretion in this matter, &s;o as to puni&s;h capitally in every
in&s;tance of fal&s;e writing what&s;oever. On the contrary, in
<PB N="201" REF="260">
terms of their own cu&s;tom and cour&s;e of practice, by which
chiefly the &s;tatutes have been expounded, &s;o as at all to permit
the pronouncing of &s;uch a &s;entence, this power &s;tands limi|ted
to certain the more audacious and dangerous modes of
fal&s;ification of writing, and could not now be warrantably ex|tended
to other modes, which have not hitherto been thought
de&s;erving of the highe&s;t vengeance of the law. What tho&s;e
modes are, we &s;hall now proceed to enquire, and to a&s;cer|tain
at the &s;ame time the material characters of this offence,
as well in general, as in tho&s;e its more criminal kinds.</P>
<P>II. THE mo&s;t undoubted mode of capital fal&s;ification of
writing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Forgery of Writings de|fined.</NOTE> is the felonious making and publi&s;hing of a writing,
to the prejudice of another, as the <HI>&s;igned in&s;trument</HI> of a per|&s;on,
who in truth has not &s;ub&s;cribed it. Some have even
thought that it is only to this mode of fal&s;ehood that the
term of forgery properly applies; and certainly on account
of the facility, the danger, and the flagrant impudence of
&s;uch an attempt, in which one man pre&s;umptuou&s;ly a&s;&s;umes
the per&s;on, and acts in the name of another, it is the object
of the peculiar aver&s;ion and jealou&s;y of the law.</P>
<P>1. To en&s;ure the &s;ucce&s;s of &s;uch an enterpri&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Imitation of Hand, how far nece&s;&s;ary.</NOTE> the of|fender
commonly proceeds by imitation of the hand-wri|ting
of the per&s;on, to whom the deed is a&s;cribed; &s;o
that it may pa&s;s un&s;u&s;pected by favour of that re&s;emblance
and deception. And where this cour&s;e has been taken, it
will, without a doubt, be no objection to the charge, nor to
its relevancy for the highe&s;t pains of law, that the pannel
is deficient in &s;kill, or in attention, and has executed the imi|tation
in &s;o blundering and aukward a manner, as almo&s;t
to in&s;ure his detection; mi&s;pelling the name perhaps, or
<PB N="202" REF="261">
omitting part of the &s;ub&s;cription. A blunder of this kind hap|pened
in the ca&s;e of Margaret Ni&s;bet in 1727; who, in forging
a bill on the Duche&s;s of Gordon, who was not a Peere&s;s in
her own right, had omitted the Chri&s;tian name. Such
mi&s;takes, like the want of the water-mark on the paper
of a forged bank-note<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The Twelve Judges of England found that this was no objection in the ca&s;e of James Elliot, 21&s;t July 1777. Leach's Ca&s;es, No. 87.</NOTE>, do not alter the dole or depravity,
but only the prudence of the purpo&s;e; which is quite a &s;e|parate
con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>2. BUT although this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May be forgery without imita|tion of Hand.</NOTE> of counterfeiting a man's hand, be
an ordinary, it does not however &s;eem to be a nece&s;&s;ary cir|cum&s;tance
of the capital offence. For there are &s;everal &s;itua|tions,
in which, without employing that expedient, the of|fender
equally gives out and publi&s;hes a writing as the deed
and &s;igned in&s;trument of a per&s;on who knows nothing of
it; and in which he not only accompli&s;hes the &s;ame end,
but does &s;o, &s;ub&s;tantially, through the very &s;ame mode of im|po&s;ition,
and one which proceeds from an equal depravity
of purpo&s;e. Thus, if money be obtained by the fal&s;e ac|ceptance
of a bill, in name of one to whom it is &s;pecially
addre&s;&s;ed by name and de&s;cription, and who is a per&s;on of
known credit; this &s;eems to be not the le&s;s a forgery, and a ca|pital
crime, that this per&s;on never could &s;ign his name at all<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">A charge of forgery was made upon an allegation of this &s;ort, <HI>inter alia,</HI> again&s;t John Robert&s;on, of the 9th December 1709. The Lords, on the whole circum&s;tances of that ca&s;e, found the libel not relevant. But no objection was moved on the ground of two of the receipts being forged in name of per&s;ons who could not write.</NOTE>.
It is &s;till true, that the offender has made a fal&s;e deed for
him, and in his name, and that he has done &s;o, not by any
<PB N="203" REF="262">
&s;ort of alteration, corruption, or other evil practice upon a
writing which that per&s;on had &s;igned, (for any of the&s;e is
a different <HI>mode</HI> of impo&s;ition), but by the bold device of
a&s;&s;uming his per&s;on, &s;igning his name for him, and produ|cing
and pa&s;&s;ing <HI>as his genuine &s;igned writing,</HI> that to which
he never &s;et his hand. That in the&s;e circum&s;tances the
fal&s;ehood was more likely to be detected, (for the objection
comes to no more than this), is quite an extraneous con|&s;ideration,
and nowi&s;e alters the &s;ub&s;tance, nor le&s;&s;ens the
guilt of that which is done. Farther, as the complete crime
does not in any in&s;tance depend on the &s;ucce&s;s of the device
in the obtaining of money; &s;o it will &s;till be forgery,
though this bill, as may probably happen, &s;hould be &s;top|ped
on the very fir&s;t attempt to u&s;e it.</P>
<P>NEITHER does there &s;eem to be much di&s;tinction between
&s;uch a ca&s;e and this:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;es of Forge|ry without Imi|tation of Hand.</NOTE> that one who has got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a
bill, which &s;tands indor&s;ed to another per&s;on of the &s;ame
name and &s;urname, but who is of better credit, and is fully
de&s;cribed in the indor&s;ement, transfers and indor&s;es this bill
to &s;ome third per&s;on, who pays him the value, believing him
to be the per&s;on de&s;cribed in the preceding indor&s;ement. For,
though he &s;ign his own name and &s;urname, and do not coun|terfeit
the hand of the true creditor; &s;till he &s;igns for, and
a&s;&s;umes the per&s;on of that man, and in his name utters the
bill, which is taken upon the credit of that name, and may
be farther circulated by means of it, to &s;uch as are not ac|quainted
with the hand.</P>
<P>IT would be quite a different ca&s;e, if one who has found
a bill blank-indor&s;ed, &s;hould, on getting payment of it,
grant receipt or indor&s;ement under a pure <HI>fictitious</HI> name.
For in &s;uch a ca&s;e, not only does the offender not pre&s;ume.
<PB N="204" REF="263">
to &s;ign for another exi&s;ting per&s;on; but the credit is here
given to the offender him&s;elf <HI>per&s;onally,</HI> as an individual,
without any regard to the name which he a&s;&s;umes, or any
reliance on the character, &s;ufficiency, or de&s;cription of any
other man. Though &s;igned with a fictitious name, the in|&s;trument
is yet taken and received as the in&s;trument and
&s;ecurity of him, the very per&s;on who tenders it, and no
other. Though criminal, this act is therefore not a proper
forgery. There is a &s;ituation, different from either of the&s;e,
and which holds a middle place between them. This is
where the forgery is of the name of a per&s;on who never
exi&s;ted, but to whom at the &s;ame time a certain <HI>character
and de&s;cription</HI> is attributed, &s;uch as is a natural means of
obtaining credit, and may have the effect of procuring mo|ney.
A charge of this &s;ort, along with others, appears in
the libel again&s;t William Hunter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 2. 3. &amp; 5. 1708.</NOTE> and is to this purpo&s;e.
Hunter had obtained confirmation of Margaret Guine,
<HI>&s;pou&s;e of John Hodge, as executor to her decea&s;ed brother</HI> Robert
Guine, who was creditor, by certificate, to the African
Company. In truth, there was no &s;uch per&s;on as Margaret
Guine: John Hodge was not alive but dead, and the name
of his relict was not Margaret Guine, but Agnes Crawford.
Hunter proceeded to forge an indor&s;ement, in his own fa|vour,
of the &s;aid certificate, in name of John Hodge and
Margaret Guine; and this he pre&s;ented for payment, but,
as far as appears, without &s;ucce&s;s. This entire charge was
found relevant, and the pannel, having confe&s;&s;ed, was con|demned
to die. But the que&s;tion was not debated; and as
the forgery of Margaret Guine's name was combined with
that of the name of John Hodge, a real per&s;on, and likewi&s;e
with a &s;eparate and capital charge, (of which afterwards),
the ca&s;e cannot perhaps be cited as a precedent.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="264">
THIS point of doctrine may be farther illu&s;trated thus,
There are two ways in which the law of Scotland allows a
per&s;on to &s;ub&s;cribe;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Forgery of Deeds &s;igned by Notaries.</NOTE> by his own hand if he is capable, and
otherwi&s;e by the hand of notaries, to whom he gives man|date,
and in pre&s;ence of witne&s;&s;es, who &s;ign along with the
notaries. Now, if it &s;hould happen, (though, fortunately,
&s;uch a combination is far from likely), that the due num|ber
of per&s;ons con&s;pire to frame a fal&s;e deed of this la&s;t
&s;ort, for a per&s;on who cannot write, they have it in their
power to accompli&s;h their purpo&s;e without any imitation of
hands, and, in one &s;en&s;e, without even any fal&s;e &s;ub&s;cription;
by &s;igning, each of them his own name, in their re&s;pective
capacities of notary and witne&s;s, but <HI>fal&s;ely</HI> relating and
affirming a mandate &s;o to do. Now, &s;ub&s;tantially, this is
the very &s;ame thing, and as much or even more worthy of
a capital pain, as when John &s;igns the name, and counter|feits
the hand of James. In truth, the&s;e notaries <HI>do</HI> &s;ign the
name of another man; that is, in the way, wherein law allows
per&s;ons in his condition to &s;ign: and whether the appear|ance
of a genuine and authentic deed is given to a fal&s;e one
in the one way of &s;ub&s;cription or the other, there &s;eems to be
no rea&s;on for di&s;tingui&s;hing; &s;ince the &s;ub&s;tance,&mdash;the wic|kedne&s;s,
and the effect of what is done, is the &s;ame in both
&s;ituations. This is not a fictitious ca&s;e; for &s;entence of
death pa&s;&s;ed on Mungo Strachan notary<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Strachan was not concerned in the other acts above mentioned, charged again&s;t Hunter, and which were laid in a &s;eparate libel of the &s;ame date.

<P><PB N="206" REF="265">
OF a nature nearly allied to this, and depending on the
&s;ame notion of the offence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Forgery by fal&s;e Mandate to No|taries.</NOTE> is the no le&s;s improbable, but
al&s;o real and adjudged ca&s;e, of one man per&s;onating an|other
who cannot write, and thus impo&s;ing upon notaries,
to whom he gives mandate to &s;ign for him whom he
per&s;onates, and who is to them unknown. This is the
de&s;cription of the ca&s;e of David Donald&s;on.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 12. 1611.</NOTE> Who, having
got into the confidence of one Alexander, an old, bed|rid,
and facile per&s;on, and blind of one eye, and having
made u&s;e of this &s;ituation to purloin the man's effects,
and among other things two bonds for money, fell upon
this device, for enabling him to recover the contents. He
employs a notary, as if by Alexander's de&s;ire, to draw an
a&s;&s;ignation in favour of him, Donald&s;on, of all Alexander's
effects, and in particular of the&s;e bonds. Which being done,
he carries this notary and another, along with &s;undry hone&s;t
witne&s;&s;es, but all of them &s;trangers to Alexander, to a
hou&s;e in Leith, where they are &s;hown Alexander, (as they be|lieve),
lying ill in bed, and with a patch on his eye and cheek.
After hearing the a&s;&s;ignation read, this per&s;on gives man|date
to the notaries to &s;ub&s;cribe it for him; which is ac|cordingly
done. In truth, this per&s;on was not Alexander,
but one John Henry, a cobler, and an a&s;&s;ociate of Donald|&s;on's,
whom he had &s;educed to join in the plot. The in&s;tru|ment
being thus obtained, without any manner of wrong on
the part of any one who&s;e hand appeared at it, and Donald|&s;on,
out of impatience to reap the fruit of his villany, pro|ceeding
to do diligence upon the bonds in Alexander's life|time;
the truth comes to light, and he is tried and convicted,
and has &s;entence of death.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="266">
EXTRAORDINARY as this ca&s;e is, it is not, however, &s;ingle
of its kind.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Forgery by fal&s;e Mandate to No|taries.</NOTE> John Wat&s;on in Barnhill, had in like manner
&s;entence of death; having fraudulently in&s;erted the name of

deceitfully bringing another man to John Craig, notar,
and making him to name him&s;elf John Coutts, and &s;o gave
command to the notar to &s;ub&s;cribe.&endq; Now, the device
employed in the&s;e in&s;tances, in this leading character en|tirely
agrees with the more common one of the imitation of
hand-writing, that it is the fal&s;e a&s;&s;umption of the per&s;on
of another <HI>in the act of &s;igning a deed;</HI> and whether this be
done by the forger's taking the pen into his own hand, or
by his authori&s;ing, under a fictitious per&s;on, the pen of ano|ther,
according to the form by law allowed, &s;eems to be
immaterial to the guilt of the ca&s;e; if it be not that the
latter is the bolder, more deliberate, and more complicated
artifice of the two.</P>
<P>3. ACCORDING to the principle which has ruled in the&s;e
ca&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Forgery of Sig|nature by Mark or Initials.</NOTE> a que&s;tion may &s;eem to ari&s;e, whether a capital forge|ry
may not even be committed by &s;ub&s;criptions of &s;o irregu|lar
a kind, as &s;carcely admit forgery in the way of imita|tion
of hand, but to which, in &s;ome in&s;tances, the civil
court have however paid regard in patrimonial que&s;tions.
As if one man &s;hall a&s;&s;ume the per&s;on of another, and in his
name draw money which he has right to, and &s;hall put
his mark to a receipt or promi&s;&s;ory note for the &s;um, and
authori&s;e the payer, in his pre&s;ence, to write his a&s;&s;umed
name and de&s;ignation, in the u&s;ual manner, round the mark.
Or if he &s;hall pre&s;ent a bill, bearing acceptance, by mark
or initials, of one who is in good credit, and &s;hall bring an
a&s;&s;ociate along with him, who per&s;onates this acceptor, and
<PB N="208" REF="267">
confe&s;&s;es the &s;ub&s;cription, &s;uch as it is; and &s;hall thus draw
money on the bill, under the credit of this fal&s;e acceptance.
No ca&s;e of this character has yet been tried in our Courts.
And though in the Engli&s;h it has more than once been de|cided
that &s;uch a device is forgery, and falls under their
&s;tatutes in that behalf<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">This was the opinion of nine of the Twelve Judges, on the ca&s;e of Elizabeth Dunn, in September 1765, who had per&s;onated a &s;ailor's widow and executrix, and on the credit of that character, had got an advance of money, for which &s;he gave a note in the &s;ame character and &s;igned with her mark. Another judg|ment to the &s;ame effect was in the ca&s;e of Fitzgerald and Lee, who forged a &s;ea|man's will, &s;igned with his mark, and thereupon obtained a probate, and a ticket for payment for certain arrears of wages. Leach's Ca&s;es, No. 31. No. 9.</NOTE>; yet this may not afford a certain in|ference
with re&s;pect to our law: Both becau&s;e &s;omething may
depend on the binding power of &s;uch in&s;truments in civil
matters, according to the practice of the two countries, and
becau&s;e the frequent in&s;tances of fraudulent device, which
occur in the more lucrative and corrupted market of that
kingdom, have led to a broader con&s;truction of the crime of
forgery, in general, in their Courts, than ours have yet been
accu&s;tomed to.</P>
<P>THESE ca&s;es al&s;o are difficult,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fal&s;e Deed above a genuine Sub&s;cription.</NOTE> and may be the &s;ubject of
different opinions. The ca&s;e of a genuine &s;ub&s;cription torn
from one deed, and pa&s;ted or affixed to another, in &s;uch a
manner as not ea&s;ily to be di&s;covered. And the ca&s;e of a
bill or promi&s;&s;ory-note, drawn above a genuine &s;ub&s;cription,
but which &s;tood at &s;uch a di&s;tance from the original wri|ting
to which it had been affixed, as to allow this fraudulent
operation. In one &s;en&s;e, the &s;ub&s;cription may be &s;aid to be
genuine; yet it is no le&s;s true, that the act of &s;igning, as
relative to this bill or note,&mdash;the application of the per&s;on's
<PB N="209" REF="268">
name to this particular u&s;e, is the pure act and fiction of the
offender. Accordingly, if ancient practice is to be followed,
this al&s;o &s;hall be judged to be a forgery; for we have a
&s;trong precedent of capital pain applied to a charge of
this de&s;cription. I allude to the ca&s;e already mentioned,
of Halliday,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 8. 1787.</NOTE> Lowrie, and others, again&s;t whom the <HI>fir&s;t</HI>
and principal charge was thus: That having got a blank
paper from Captain William Ne&s;bit, &s;igned with his name,
and intended to be filled up with a decree-arbitral, they
fal&s;ely filled up the paper with the di&s;charge of a bond of
1200 merks, due to Ne&s;bit by Lowrie<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The ca&s;e is printed at large in the Appendix.</NOTE>. No doubt &s;eems to
have been entertained that this was a capital charge<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">It appears from the libel and debate, in the ca&s;e of Robert Binning, July 2. and 3. 1662, that he had before undergone &s;ome arbitrary puni&s;hment, for writing a fal&s;e charge to &s;et him&s;elf at liberty when in pri&s;on, and attempting to authenti|cate it (which was a high contempt), by the Signet, conclu&s;ion, and &s;ub&s;cription, which he had torn from an old letter to the Signet. But the circum&s;tances of that prior trial (if there was one), do not appear in the record.</NOTE></P>
<P>I HAVE not,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Names of Wit|ne&s;&s;es forged to a true Deed.</NOTE> however, found any precedent which deter|mines
this other, and important que&s;tion, Whether a capi|tal
forgery is alike committed by counterfeiting the hand
of witne&s;&s;es to a true in&s;trument, as the hand it&s;elf of the
alleged granter of the deed. Certainly in either ca&s;e a &s;ub|&s;cription
is counterfeited, in order to authenticate a deed,
and an in&s;trument is thus rendered <HI>ex facie</HI> valid, and &s;uch
as cannot without a proof of forgery be taken away, in|&s;tead
of being, (as otherwi&s;e it would be), <HI>ex facie</HI> null, and
liable to an ab&s;olute exception in law; &s;o that the opera|tion
is to the material prejudice of the per&s;on &s;ub&s;cribing.
<PB N="210" REF="269">
The difficulty is, that the in&s;trument is not fal&s;e in the fun|damental
matter, the &s;ub&s;cription of the party who is meant
to be taken bound, but only in the form and manner of
that &s;ub&s;cription, which are but a quality of the deed. Yet
it is &s;uch a quality, that our law holds the writing, in all mat|ters
of importance, to be the &s;ame as none without it; and
as &s;ub&s;criptions are counterfeited in order to avoid an ob|jection
which would otherwi&s;e be as fatal to the deed as the
want even of the granter's name, &s;o it may be plau&s;ibly ar|gued,
that &s;uch a charge ought to be &s;u&s;tained. But on this
head I will not pre&s;ume to offer my private opinion.</P>

of witne&s;&s;es, there is fal&s;ehood committed in the

For not only the names of the&s;e witne&s;&s;es are fal&s;e, but al&s;o

what they mu&s;t be in re&s;pect of form, and what in re&s;pect

<P>THE form will not detain us long. For in this matter
our practice does not di&s;tingui&s;h, but holds the forgery
to be a capital offence, whether the writing be in the
form of a &s;olemn and regularly atte&s;ted deed, in which the
hands of party, writer, and witne&s;&s;es, arc all counterfeited,
or in that of a holograph writing, or though it be even a
naked and unvouched &s;ub&s;cription, &s;uch as the acceptance
or indor&s;ement of a bill of exchange. Indeed, I do not
ob&s;erve that this has ever been di&s;puted, excepting in
the one ca&s;e of Raybould, tried for the forgery of bank|notes,
where it was objected, that the capital crime could
not be committed by the counterfeiting of unauthentica|ted
&s;ub&s;criptions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 18. &amp; 19. 1768.</NOTE> &s;uch as the names of the officers of the

the opinion, which in it&s;elf &s;eems not to be &s;ound,
that the fal&s;e writing mu&s;t be drawn in &s;uch a &s;hape, as
would render it, if true, a binding and unexceptionable
voucher in law. If, be&s;ide the fal&s;ehood, it labour under de|fects
in matter of form, or of regular execution, which
might furni&s;h an attentive or &s;kilful ob&s;erver with an ex|ception

purpo&s;e; nay, may not hinder it to be &s;ucce&s;sful, and
indeed does not more affect the chance of &s;ucce&s;s, than the
di&s;&s;imilitude of the hands, or a blunder in the &s;tyle of the
deed, which, while they expo&s;e the fraud to detection, are
however no ob&s;tacle to the inflicting of the ordinary pains.
In general it is not the rule of law with re&s;pect to any crime,
(for it would be a great encouragement to offenders), to de|ny
that it has been committed, becau&s;e by a higher degree of
circum&s;pection on the part of the injured per&s;on it might
have been prevented; if he has done nothing to facilitate
or tempt to the commi&s;&s;ion of it. The offender &s;hall there|fore

not enabled him to execute it to the be&s;t advantage: as

<P>5. OUR de&s;cription of this &s;ort of fal&s;ehood leads us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crime not com|plete without uttering.</NOTE> in
the next place, to ob&s;erve, (but this it has in common with all
the other &s;pecies of the offence), that the crime is not com|plete
by the fabrication of the writing, unle&s;s it be al&s;o utter|ed
or put to u&s;e. For if when executed it is kept lying with
the arti&s;t, unemployed, and is only by &s;ome accident brought
to light, (in the cour&s;e, perhaps, of &s;earch for &s;ome other
writing), the evidence is wanting, though &s;uch a di&s;covery
mu&s;t needs be attended with &s;u&s;picion, of the fraudulent
and felonious purpo&s;e of the fabrication; wherein lies the
e&s;&s;ence of the crime. Or grant that evidence were even
recovered of the pannel's di&s;hone&s;t purpo&s;e, as by his own
letters bearing his intention to utter the fal&s;e writing at
&s;uch a time and place, &s;till it is no more than a naked pur|po&s;e,
ju&s;t as in the ca&s;e of a libel, compo&s;ed, but not pu|bli&s;hed,
or an incendiary letter written, but not de&s;patched,
and of which it is not too late to repent, as long as it has
not given birth to any act or mea&s;ure, which may be to
the prejudice of &s;ociety or of a neighbour. It is therefore
<PB N="216" REF="275">
the act of uttering, which fir&s;t be&s;tows a form and con&s;umma|tion
on the crime, &s;uch as gives the magi&s;trate a title to en|quire
into it: Till then, it is mere wickedne&s;s of heart, for
which the offender an&s;wers not to any human tribunal.</P>
<P>IT is true, that by common &s;tyle of all indictment for this
crime, the forging, and the uttering or vending of the deed,
are &s;everally charged, and a relevancy is &s;ought on either.
But this form of libel, which is only of modern introduc|tion,
is meant to meet the ca&s;e of the pannel being found
art and part of the uttering only, (which is of equal guilt as
the forgery), and not of the fabrication; and the charge of
forgery in &s;uch a libel is not to be under&s;tood of the naked
fabrication, as in contradi&s;tinction to the uttering, but on
the contrary, as in connection with that act, which is a ne|ce&s;&s;ary
ingredient of the crime, and is implied in the &s;imple
term forgery, wherever it is u&s;ed. In the ca&s;e, accord|ingly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 12. 1780.</NOTE>
of David Reid, where this alternative &s;ort of charge
occurred, the objection taken to it was repelled, and the li|bel
&s;ent to an a&s;&s;ize.</P>
<P>AND here we may take occa&s;ion to remark,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Forger pre&s;u|med art and part of uttering.</NOTE> how contrary
forever it may be to fir&s;t appearances, that in truth it is not as
fabricator purely, but as pre&s;umptively acce&s;&s;ory to the ut|tering,
which completes the crime, that the maker of the
fal&s;e writing is puni&s;hed, when he is not <HI>proved</HI> to be the
vender al&s;o. Having been executed by him, and being un|der
his power, from the very nature of the &s;ituation
the writing cannot in ordinary ca&s;es pa&s;s out of his hands,
or be uttered, without his privity and concurrence: for
which rea&s;on, even in the more favourable ca&s;e of another
per&s;on appearing to be the vender, it will &s;till be pre&s;umed
again&s;t the fabricator, and need not be &s;hown by proof upon
<PB N="217" REF="276">
the pro&s;ecutor's part, (at lea&s;t, with the aid of ever &s;o little
communication between the vender and fabricator it will
be pre&s;umed), that they were leagued in the adventure, and
had, each of them, his &s;eparate department, with the con&s;ent
of the other. If the fabricator deny this, it will rather
lie with him, who has a &s;trong pre&s;umption again&s;t him that
he did not fabricate for nothing, to &s;pecify and prove the
manner wherein the writing pa&s;&s;ed from him without his
will; as by being withdrawn from his repo&s;itories, the lo&s;s
of it with his pocket-book, or the like.</P>
<P>IT is no le&s;s material to ob&s;erve,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What is a &s;uffi|cient uttering.</NOTE> with re&s;pect to what &s;hall
be accounted an uttering of the writing, that the great danger
of this crime has e&s;tabli&s;hed a very rigorous con&s;truction a|gain&s;t
the pannel. Not only it is no ob&s;tacle to the pro&s;ecu|tion,
that the money or other thing procured by the forgery
has been refunded to the private party, &s;o that no one ul|timately
&s;uffers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 12. &amp; 19. 1711.</NOTE> (which happened in the ca&s;e of Robert
Fleming,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 18. 19. 21. 1788.</NOTE> and of George Mackerracher); but it is not even
material that the writing &s;hould ever pa&s;s, or the impo&s;ition,
even for a moment, take effect. He hath publi&s;hed the fal&s;e
writing for genuine, and his crime of <HI>forgery</HI> is complete, as
&s;oon as he has produced or employed it towards the pre|judice
of another; whereby not only is his felonious in|tention
manife&s;t, but in&s;tead of being under his power as
before, the fal&s;e deed is communicated to a &s;tranger, and
the la&s;t &s;tep is taken that depends on him to accompli&s;h the
intended deception. The libel is therefore good, if the fal&s;e
bond has been made the ground of action or diligence,
though no money has been recovered; or if it has been
produced and pleaded, or claimed upon in judgment, though
not <HI>abidden by</HI> upon challenge, (for this &s;eems to be only
<PB N="218" REF="277">
a contrivance for &s;hortening the civil proce&s;s of improba|tion
of the writing); as in the ca&s;e of William and Tho|mas
Mackie, January 16. and February 2. 1636, who were
pillored, declared infamous, and bani&s;hed, for pleading on
a fal&s;e di&s;charge of a bond: or if the judicial bond of cau|tionry
has been tendered to the proper officer; as was found

the Court had repelled the defence, that it had never
been abidden by in judgment, nor u&s;ed to the actual preju|dice
of the party. To confirm which precedent, the Le|gi&s;lature,
in the &s;tatute 1621, c. 22. declared, that it &s;hall not
protect from the pains of fal&s;ehood to pa&s;s from the writing
upon challenge, or engage not to make u&s;e of it in future.
Notwith&s;tanding this act, which is conceived in explicit
terms, doubts had however continued to be entertained con|cerning
the bare production of a writing in judgment, or the
entry of it on record, how far either of the&s;e was to be
reputed an u&s;e of the writing, and a completion of the crime.
<PB N="219" REF="278">
For the &s;ame act of &s;ederunt which convicts Alexander For|re&s;t

&s;amyne in judgement, albeit they do not byde be them,

the &s;aids fal&s;e wreattes and puni&s;chable.&endq; This reque&s;t
does not &s;eem to have been complied with. But it has ever
been held in all modern practice, that a writing is to this
effect &s;ufficiently u&s;ed by the bare production in judgment;
which in &s;ub&s;tance is always the founding of a right or plea
upon it as a genuine voucher. And with re&s;pect al&s;o to the
regi&s;tration; if either it be a regi&s;tration for diligence, or
&s;uch which is ordered by law, as in the ca&s;e of &s;ei&s;ins,
hornings, and &s;ome others, the &s;ame rule &s;hall probably be
held: for in all the&s;e in&s;tances the entry on record is the
public a&s;&s;ertion of a claim upon the writing as good. If it
is recorded for pre&s;ervation only, there is more room for
argument upon the other &s;ide; and this que&s;tion has not
yet been tried.</P>
<P>6. ONE thing more is implied in our de&s;cription of this
&s;ort of fal&s;ehood.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Forging, &amp;c. mu&s;t be feloni|ous.</NOTE> That the making and uttering of the deed
be felonious, or with intent to injure. Thus it is not a

at his de&s;ire, a per&s;on &s;hall &s;ign a draught or receipt in the
name of that other; as often happens among per&s;ons of low
degree. For there is no impo&s;ition here, either done or in|tended,
in the tran&s;action. Mackenzie takes notice of &s;uch

the other part, the law will under&s;tand it to be fraudulent,
and to the prejudice of another, if there be a purpo&s;e to
gain any &s;ort of advantage by the fal&s;ehood, though this
&s;hould not be of &s;o high a degree, as amounts to the cheat|ing
out of the &s;um or thing to which the writing relates.
Thus it is forgery, (though po&s;&s;ibly the excu&s;e might be
con&s;idered in the &s;entence), to frame a fal&s;e bill, bond, or
other voucher for ever &s;o ju&s;t a debt, or a di&s;charge for
money which was truly paid, but the payment forgotten to
be vouched; for &s;till the offender has made a fal&s;e deed, and
is thus far benefited, and the other party prejudiced, that
he has written evidence of the &s;tate of the tran&s;action, and
therein enjoys that &s;ecurity which he coveted, and thought

<P>I SHALL now,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Art and Part of Forgery.</NOTE> before proceeding, &s;ubjoin a few things con|cerning

a&s;&s;i&s;tance lent to the fabrication it&s;elf; &s;o that if
one per&s;on furni&s;h the &s;croll of the fal&s;e deed, another
dictate the deed from that &s;croll, a third write it, and a
fourth affix the fal&s;e &s;ub&s;cription in pre&s;ence of the re&s;t,
all four are alike guilty of the crime. This was nearly the
&s;ituation of parties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 8. 1597.</NOTE> in the ca&s;e of Halliday and others, where
Marjoribanks the notary dictated a &s;croll of the fal&s;e di&s;|charge

Lowrie and John Winzet, the la&s;t of whom &s;igned a
fal&s;e name of witne&s;s to the deed. All the&s;e per&s;ons had

&s;uch occa&s;ions; though they &s;ign their own names, and after
their ordinary fa&s;hion, they are not the le&s;s art and part

vender of a fal&s;e writ, being a different per&s;on from the
fabricator, is neverthele&s;s equally puni&s;hable as he, and
that it is even as pre&s;umptively art and part of the vending,
that the fabricator him&s;elf is puni&s;hed, when he is not pro|ved
to be the vender too. This point is equally clear upon
the cour&s;e of practice, the opinion of lawyers, and the au|thority
of our &s;tatutes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1540, c. 80. 1551, c. 22.</NOTE> &s;ome of which are upon this head
expre&s;s. The plain rea&s;on is, that even when the vender
has not from the fir&s;t been privy to the proce&s;s of fabrica|tion,
(which, however, he often is), he by wittingly u&s;ing
the fal&s;e deed, becomes participant of, and a&s;&s;ociates him|&s;elf
to the whole guilt of that contrivance, which he adopts
in its more mature &s;tate, and by his indu&s;try brings to the
de&s;ired accompli&s;hment and i&s;&s;ue; in like manner as the pu|bli&s;her
of a libel is participant of the guilt of the compo&s;i|tion,
which by his art he di&s;&s;eminates to the world. It is
al&s;o to be con&s;idered, that the u&s;er of a fal&s;e writing, more
e&s;pecially if it be drawn directly in his own favour, mu&s;t
in rea&s;on be pre&s;umed to be him&s;elf the fal&s;ifier too, unle&s;s
he can by evidence throw off that charge upon another<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Lex 33. Dig. L. 4. Cod. ad L. Corn. de fal&s;is.</NOTE>.

<PB N="223" REF="282">
ca&s;e of the arti&s;t who makes the plate, or the paper, for
throwing off the fal&s;e bank note. The deci&s;ion in &s;uch ca&s;es
will depend on circum&s;tances. If, (which has &s;ometimes
been the ca&s;e), it can be &s;hown that the trade&s;man not on|ly
knew the unlawful de&s;tination of his commodity, but was
in a &s;ociety with the forger and vender, by which they were
&s;everally to perform their parts in the adventure, and to
receive their &s;hare of the profits thence accruing; this &s;eems
to be nothing le&s;s than an acce&s;&s;ion to the forgery: for there
is here one joint and undivided undertaking, in which each
is participant of what is done by the other, and mu&s;t an&s;wer
for it, as if done by him&s;elf. In&s;tead of this, if there be no
more in the ca&s;e but an employment of the trade&s;man to exe|cute
&s;uch a piece of work in his trade, he is not thereby in|volved
in any cogni&s;able degree of guilt; not even though
he &s;hould have rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect the evil purpo&s;e to which
his handy-work is to be applied. This, at lea&s;t, was the
judgment of the Court upon &s;uch a ca&s;e, or rather a more
unfavourable one,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 12. &amp; 14. 1781.</NOTE> that of John Brown, again&s;t whom this
verdict was returned: &startq;Find it proven, that the bra&s;s plate

Brown, and that he was privy to the concealing of the

it is not proven that he adhibited the &s;ub&s;cription to, or
i&s;&s;ued any of the three notes libelled on and produced.&endq;
The judgment was to a&s;&s;oilzie the pannel <HI>&s;impliciter.</HI> But
between the&s;e there lies a middle, though more unlikely &s;i|tuation,
that of a trade&s;man who has a &s;pecial privity to the
evil object of his employment, and receives on that account
a reward or extraordinary hire, but has no farther concern,
in the adventure or its profits. It may be thought, that up|on.

<P>II.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fal&s;e Notaries, how puni&s;hable.</NOTE> I SHALL now &s;ay nothing more of that &s;ort of fal&s;e|hood,
which con&s;i&s;ts in the publi&s;hing of a deed as the &s;igned

him&s;elf into the per&s;on of another; he is merely in his own
per&s;on, and in his official character, telling, a mo&s;t flagrant,
impudent, and dangerous lie. Neverthele&s;s, although in the
matter of officers executions this di&s;tinction &s;eems to have
been acknowledged, and a milder cour&s;e to have been ta|ken;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 15. &amp; 28. 1605.</NOTE>
as appears from the ca&s;e of Strachan the me&s;&s;enger,
who for four fal&s;e executions of charge and denunciation,
was only &s;courged and deprived of his office; yet with re|&s;pect
to notaries, who&s;e tru&s;t of office is higher, and their
functions of &s;till more con&s;equence, and &s;uch as deeply affect
the lieges in their mo&s;t valuable e&s;tates, the contrary &s;eems
to have been holden. The act 1540, c. 80. was more e&s;pe|cially
directed again&s;t the fal&s;ehood of notaries; and in like
manner as the other &s;tatutes were held to authori&s;e the in|&s;licting
of death in other ca&s;es, this &s;eems to have been held
a warrant for the &s;ame &s;everity upon this cla&s;s of men, who&s;e
fidelity is &s;o important to be guarded. Thus, on the &s;ame day
that Ferne and Tarbet were condemned to die for forging a
charter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 15. &amp; 16. 1600.</NOTE> Robert Innes notary had the like &s;entence for a
fal&s;e and antedated &s;ei&s;in, wittingly made by him upon it.
Whether the &s;ei&s;in in that ca&s;e bore the names of wit|ne&s;&s;es,
<PB N="225" REF="284">
or, if it did, whether the&s;e al&s;o were forged, does
not appear from the record. But though the ca&s;e be,
that the notary does not &s;ign the names of pretended wit|ne&s;&s;es,
but induces per&s;ons to &s;ign along with him in that
capacity, the wickedne&s;s and the guilt &s;eem to be much
the &s;ame: In either ca&s;e, the whole &s;ei&s;in is &s;till a fiction
of the notary's own contrivance, and he is art and part
of the fal&s;e &s;ub&s;criptions of his a&s;&s;ociates.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;e of Innes is not the only in&s;tance of this con|&s;truction
of the law. On the 20th December 1616, Alex|ander
Cook notary, Sheriff-clerk of Berwick&s;hire, upon a
libel which is laid on the act 1540, for fal&s;ehood in his
office of notary, had &s;entence of death; having vitiated
the entry of a &s;ei&s;in in his protocol-book, and having gi|ven
forth two extracts of it, of different dates, and judici|ally
&s;worn at different times to the truth of both, Farther;
it had been thought to be of little moment, whether the
notorial in&s;trument were fal&s;e by corruption and abu&s;e of
tru&s;t in a real notary, or through the fal&s;e a&s;&s;umption of
that character by one who was no notary, and who of cour&s;e
could give no true in&s;trument of that kind. For this &s;ort
of fal&s;ehood, William Norval was condemned to die on the
9th June 1602, and John Mo&s;crop, writer in Edinburgh, on
the 8th February 1597. Al&s;o, among other charges, Tho|mas
Marjoribanks was convicted as a fal&s;e and pretended
notary, on the &s;ame libel with Mo&s;crop, and had &s;entence of
death. No in&s;tance of either of the&s;e kinds of fal&s;ehood
has been brought to trial in later times.</P>
<P>I SHALL now di&s;mi&s;s the&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;cretion of the Court in puni&s;hing For|gery.</NOTE> the capital fal&s;ifications of

power, as in the ca&s;e of theft, to accommodate the pain
to the whole circum&s;tances of the offender, and of the tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion.

<P>III. I CANNOT di&s;cover,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fal&s;ification of Writs, how pu|ni&s;hable.</NOTE> that, be&s;ide the two &s;pecies already
&s;poken of, any other fal&s;ification of writing has, at any period
of our practice, been thought nece&s;&s;ary to be cha&s;tifed with
the &s;ame &s;everity. Some there are, which, in re&s;pect of
prejudice to the party who is meant to be injured, and
almo&s;t in re&s;pect of the wickedne&s;s of the contriver, may
&s;eem to be little &s;hort of tho&s;e to which the name of for|gery,
in its &s;tricter &s;en&s;e, is applied. If the holder of a bill
alter the &s;um to his own advantage, or if the writer of a
<PB N="227" REF="286">
deed in&s;ert provi&s;ions, without the knowledge of his employ|er,
in favour of him&s;elf or of others; certainly an act, which
is not the act of the party, is here publi&s;hed as authentica|ted
by his hand, equally as in the ca&s;e of his &s;ub&s;cription
being counterfeited. But as devices of this kind are neither
&s;o frequent nor &s;o dangerous as forgeries, by rea&s;on of the
greater difficulty which attends the execution of them, and
as in point of boldne&s;s at lea&s;t, if not of depravity, there
is &s;ome difference between the corruption of a genuine &s;igned
writing, and the &s;uppo&s;ition and &s;igning of an entire deed in
the name of another, &s;o the lenity of our practice &s;eems to
have laid hold of this di&s;tinction, how &s;lender &s;oever, to &s;ave
the offender's life<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The &s;tatute 7th Geo. II. c. 22. which makes &s;uch offences capital in Eng|land, does not &s;eem to extend to this country.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT the indulgence goes no farther. As great frauds and
fal&s;ehoods,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sentences for fal&s;ified Writ.</NOTE> &s;uch contrivances are puni&s;hable with us at com|mon

the ca&s;e of Thomas Mathie, tried in the criminal Court, 10th
March 1727. This man had been factor to the York-build|ings
Company on their e&s;tate of Winton; and the charge
again&s;t him was, that after recal of his factory, he had up|lifted
or had taken bills for certain rents and &s;ums of mo|ney
addebted to the Company, and had given di&s;charges of
them, which, as well as the bills, he antedated, to conceal
the fraud, and that in one in&s;tance, he had cancelled a bill
payable to the Company, and taken a new one of a fal&s;e
date, and in his own name, for the &s;um. The&s;e things were
charged as being, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, of the &s;ame nature with
the counterfeiting of a new power of factory; in as much as
through the&s;e fal&s;e devices, his unwarrantable acts of admini|&s;tration
were in appearance brought within the term of his ex|pired
power; and this for the fraudulent purpo&s;e of bringing
<PB N="229" REF="288">
the effects of the Company into his own hands. The libel was
found relevant<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">March 20. 1727. The Lords &startq;find, that the &s;aid Thomas Mathie, pannel, after intimation was made to him that his factory upon the e&s;tate of Winton, from the Company of Undertakers for rai&s;ing the Thames water in York-build|ings, was revoked, and a new factory from &s;aid Company was granted in fa|vours of Mr Henry Streatchy, pur&s;uer, and Mr Archibald Robert&s;on; that the pannel did thereafter grant receipts and di&s;charges to, or did take accepted bills from the per&s;ons debtors to the &s;aid Company in the produce of the &s;aid e&s;tate, on account either of rents, coal, &s;alt, or pan-wood, and did antedate the &s;aids receipts, di&s;charges or bills, by making them to bear date prior to the re|calling of his factory, though they were really granted po&s;terior thereto; the pannel's &s;o doing, in all or any of the particular in&s;tances &s;pecified in the libel, relevant to infer an arbitrary puni&s;hment; and repelled the haill defences pro|poned for the pannel.&endq;</NOTE>; and the pannel being convicted of one ar|ticle
of the charge, relative to the colliers' and &s;alters' bills,

a per&s;on in his office, &s;uch as certificate of marriage, bap|ti&s;m,
proclamation of banns or the like, that this &s;ort of fla|grant

is an article of criminal charge; though no trial of that kind

<P>IV.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Form of proce&s;s for Forgery.</NOTE> SUFFICIENT has now been &s;aid concerning the fal&s;i|fication

which, from the remote&s;t period of our practice, has
been &s;ubject to this peculiarity, that it may equally be
brought in the Court of Se&s;&s;ion, or of Ju&s;ticiary; and more|over,
(in which re&s;pect its &s;ituation is &s;till more extraordi|nary),
that though commencing in the civil Court, it often
times terminates and comes to i&s;&s;ue in the other.</P>
<P>THE cau&s;es are obvious,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Court of Se&s;&s;ion can try Forgery.</NOTE> which have led to the receiving
of the Lords of Se&s;&s;ion, as Judges competent in the matter
<PB N="230" REF="289">
of forgery. The crime often comes to light in the cour&s;e
of proce&s;s depending in that Court; whence ari&s;es a con|tingent
juri&s;diction over the offender, who is cha&s;ti&s;ed &s;um|marily
and without delay, in the very tribunal where he
has tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, for his &s;candalous attempt to impo&s;e upon
their wi&s;dom, and to pervert the cour&s;e of ju&s;tice. Another,
and an equally &s;ub&s;tantial rea&s;on, lies in the very difficult and
tedious nature, generally &s;peaking, of the proof of forgery,
which is often impo&s;&s;ible to be ab&s;olved, as mu&s;t be the ca&s;e
with every trial by a&s;&s;ize and in the criminal Court, in the
cour&s;e of a &s;ingle fitting.</P>
<P>IN addition to the&s;e rea&s;ons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Are they exclu|&s;ive Judges in fir&s;t in&s;tance.</NOTE> which of them&s;elves are &s;uf|ficient
to ju&s;tify this departure from ordinary rules, Mac|kenzie<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Tit. Fal&s;ehood, No. 4.</NOTE> hath farther &s;uppo&s;ed, that certain &s;tatutes have ex|pre&s;sly
be&s;towed this juri&s;diction on the Lords of Se&s;&s;ion.
Nay, he has expre&s;sly &s;aid that they are Judges in the fir&s;t
In&s;tance, exclu&s;ive of the criminal Court; in confirmation
of which opinion he appeals to the judgment in the ca&s;e of
Lord Blantyre, and affirms that the books of adjournal do
not contain an in&s;tance of proce&s;s for forgery commencing
in that Court. But in all this there is &s;omewhat of inaccu|racy.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1555, c. 47.</NOTE>
Though the act of Mary for the puni&s;hment of fal&s;e
witne&s;&s;es has &s;uppo&s;ed, (for it does not introduce) the juri&s;dic|tion
of the civil Court in the matter of perjury; no one of the
&s;tatutes concerning fal&s;e notaries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 7. 1664.</NOTE> or fal&s;e writings, has any
expre&s;&s;ions to the like purpo&s;e. And in the ca&s;e of Blan|tyre,
neither did the Ju&s;tices give any &s;uch judgment as
Mackenzie has &s;uppo&s;ed, nor had they any opportunity of
doing &s;o; &s;eeing the forgery was not in&s;i&s;ted on as a &s;epa|rate
crime, but only as an aggravation of the charge of
<PB N="231" REF="290">
theft. This <HI>dictum</HI> of Mackenzie has not therefore govern|ed
the practice of later times; which, on the contrary, af|fords
&s;undry in&s;tances of proce&s;s for forgery commencing,
as well as ending, in the criminal Court. Two ca&s;es may
in particular be attended to; that of Nicol&s;on and Elliot
in January 1694, and of John Howi&s;on in November 1705,
in the fir&s;t of which, the plea of incompetency was argued,
and Mackenzie's treati&s;e referred to in &s;upport of the objec|tion.
Judgment was al&s;o given again&s;t this plea, fir&s;t in Sir

debate that the only means of improving the &s;aid pa&s;&s;es
are indirect, therefore, remit the &s;ame to be tried by and
cogno&s;ced &s;ummarily before the Lords of Se&s;&s;ion.&endq;</P>
<P>IN later times,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If exclu&s;ive where proof is indirect.</NOTE> this general po&s;ition has therefore been

exclu&s;ive Judges in all ca&s;es, &s;uch as that of Baillie, where
the proof is in the <HI>indirect</HI> and more tedious way of circum|&s;tantial

circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, that it is <HI>inexpedient</HI> to go on

therefore di&s;mi&s;&s;ing the proce&s;s. Thus the que&s;tion &s;eems

to be &s;till open to a judgment; which if it &s;hall di&s;tin|gui&s;h
the competent juri&s;diction according to the nature
of the evidence, and not according to the matter of the
proce&s;s, will e&s;tabli&s;h the one in&s;tance of this kind that oc|curs
in the whole circuit of our law.</P>
<P>THE introduction of the proce&s;s to the Court of Se&s;&s;ion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Form of the Action.</NOTE>
may be in two different ways. It may be by &s;ummons of
reduction and improbation, rai&s;ed by the private party, with
concour&s;e of the Lord Advocate; and upon which, if the
writings are produced, they may be <HI>improven,</HI> and the de|fender,
if in cu&s;tody and appearing, may be found guil|ty
of the forgery, and puni&s;hed, or remitted to the cri|minal
Court. I &s;ay, if the party appear, and the writings
are produced; for the accu&s;ed cannot be tried in ab&s;ence to
the effect of remitting, or of inflicting any pain; neither can
the writings be improven, but only &s;uffer certification, unle&s;s
they are produced; as was found in the ca&s;e of Captain Bar|clay,
January 26. 1670<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Stair's Deci&s;ions.</NOTE>. The other way, and which has
more commonly been followed in later times, is <HI>per modum
&s;implicis querelae;</HI> in the form of &s;ummary complaint, at in|&s;tance
either of the Lord Advocate, or of the private party
with his concour&s;e, and which, in &s;ub&s;tance, is the &s;ame
as an indictment, and mu&s;t, along with its li&s;t of wit|ne&s;&s;es,
and li&s;t of a&s;&s;ize, be &s;erved upon the pannel in
the like form, and upon the &s;ame <HI>induciae,</HI> as an indictment
is. This way of proceeding, which in Mackenzie's time was
reckoned extraordinary, and was only allowed in ca&s;e of for|gery
of &s;ome part of proce&s;s, or forgery committed by a mem|ber
of the College of Ju&s;tice, hath, during the greater part
of the pre&s;ent century, been employed without any regard
<PB N="233" REF="292">
to the&s;e circum&s;tances, and in particular has been the
con&s;tant mode in the many trials for the forgery of bank-notes<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The trial of Gilchri&s;t and Brodie commenced in that way in 1719, It is mentioned in Lord Roy&s;ton's notes, that in the ca&s;e of the Royal Bank again&s;t Wallace in July 1742, for forging bank-notes, which was brought into Court by complaint, &s;ome of the Lords thought that the cogni&s;ance of that form only be|longed to the Ju&s;ticiary; but in the end the juri&s;diction was &s;u&s;tained.</NOTE>. There is, however, nothing to hinder it from be|ing
employed jointly with a &s;ummons of improbation; and
this cour&s;e was followed both in the ca&s;e of Mrs Ni&s;bet in
1727, and of Adie and Shaw, July 28. 1739<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">See Acts of Sederunt.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>UPON the charge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceedings in Court of Se&s;|&s;ion.</NOTE> when duly brought into Court, the
cour&s;e of proceeding is by hearing parties on the relevan|cy
of the libel and defences, and by judgment given on
the&s;e; after which proof is taken on both &s;ides, in pre|&s;ence
of the Court. The proof may either be direct, by
te&s;timony of the per&s;ons whole names are forged, or indi|rect,
by compari&s;on of hands, <HI>alibi,</HI> and other circum&s;tantial
evidence: which two &s;orts of proof, according to the later
practice, may be employed at the &s;ame time, or even the
indirect upon failure of the other; &s;ince it is always po&s;&s;ible
that the in&s;trumentary witne&s;&s;es may mi&s;take or be cor|rupted<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">See Dictionary of Deci&s;ions, vol. i. p. 458.</NOTE>. After proof taken, and full hearing of parties
on it, and a final clo&s;e of all the pannel's relevant allega|tions,
who in this re&s;pect enjoys a benefit of bringing for|ward
new pleas, and obtaining farther proofs, which no
pannel in the Ju&s;ticiary can pretend to, the Court pro|ceed
<PB N="234" REF="293">
to give their &s;entence, as well on his guilt or innocence
of the charge, as on the verity or fal&s;ehood of the writings.
But with re&s;pect to the tenor of the &s;entence in the article
of inflicting puni&s;hment, two &s;ituations are to be di&s;tingui&s;h|ed.
The one is, where in the opinion of the Court it is fit
to puni&s;h with an arbitrary pain; which they then award
them&s;elves, and which may be carried to any extent that
is &s;hort of death: and the other is, where the public intere&s;t
requires the forfeit of the offender's life; for which end,
having no power to pronounce &s;uch a doom them&s;elves, they
mu&s;t remit the pannel to the Court of Ju&s;ticiary; there to
undergo a new trial and condemnation.</P>
<P>IN pur&s;uance of this remit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceedings in the Court of Ju&s;|ticiary.</NOTE> an indictment is framed,
charging the pannel with the fact, as in common &s;tyle, and
which is &s;erved upon him with a li&s;t of a&s;&s;ize, and of wit|ne&s;&s;es,
and of articles to be produced in evidence, on the or|dinary
<HI>induciae,</HI> and in the accu&s;tomed form. The li&s;t of wit|ne&s;&s;es
is however very brief; only con&s;i&s;ting of per&s;ons, who,
if there &s;hall be occa&s;ion for it by his denial, (as in the ca&s;e
of Raybould),<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maclaurin, p. 472.</NOTE> may prove that he is the &s;ame per&s;on who was
convicted in the Court of Se&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The following words are part of the Sollicitor-General, Mr Charles Er&s;kine's notes in the ca&s;e of John Campbell, in March and April 1731. &startq;In this trial, after the reading of the diet, the procurators for the pannel attempted two ob|jections, 1 <HI>&s;t,</HI> It was &s;aid that the extract was not proven. It was &s;igned by one John Dalrymple, of whom they pretended to know nothing; but this was ridiculed by the Judges. 2<HI>do,</HI> It was urged, that there was no proof that the pannel was the per&s;on found guilty by the Lords of Se&s;&s;ion. But it being notour to the whole Court, that he had been con&s;tantly kept in pri&s;on during the cour&s;e of the trials, both before the Se&s;&s;ion and Ju&s;ticiary, the Lords al|&s;o di&s;regarded this objection.&endq; The&s;e words are copied from the notes upon the printed papers in Mr Er&s;kine's hand-writing.

only the extracted decree of the Court of Se&s;&s;ion, and the
forged writings them&s;elves, authenticated by the &s;ub&s;crip|tion
of the Pre&s;ident of that Court. For in this, by imme|morial
cu&s;tom, the condition of &s;uch a trial for forgery is
quite &s;ingular, that it comes before the criminal Court in
the &s;hape of a concluded cau&s;e as to the matter of proof;
in which the pro&s;ecutor is not at liberty to examine wit|ne&s;&s;es,
or to bring any, what&s;oever, farther evidence, but
mu&s;t entirely re&s;t his pro&s;ecution on that which is contain|ed
in the extracted decree of the Lords of Se&s;&s;ion, to which
the libel refers, as the &s;ole proof intended to be u&s;ed.</P>
<P>WHAT is true on the pro&s;ecutor's part,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is new Proof competent there.</NOTE> is equally true on
the part of the pannel al&s;o; who, in his trial before the
Lords of Se&s;&s;ion, has already had &s;uch advantages in point
of prorogation of diet, allowance of new defences, addi|tional
proofs, and the like, as no pannel in trial before the
Court of Ju&s;ticiary can, in any the mo&s;t favourable ca&s;e, be
indulged with. It is the maxim in the civil Court, &startq;<HI>nunquam
concluditur in fal&s;o:</HI>&endq; that is to &s;ay, that as long as the
ca&s;e is in Court, and is not clo&s;ed by extract of the decree,
the Judges will not refu&s;e to li&s;ten to any relevant defence,
though late of being re&s;orted to, nor exclude new light, if
from any quarter it &s;eem likely to be let in upon the
ca&s;e. To them, therefore, and not to the criminal Court,
the pannel's reque&s;t of additional evidence &s;hould have been
made. And indeed, if a farther proof in exculpation were
allowed him, then, in ju&s;tice, mu&s;t the pro&s;ecutor al&s;o be al|lowed
a farther proof in reply, and this too by witne&s;&s;es
not contained in the original li&s;t which was &s;erved upon the
pannel; and thus the inquiry would be drawn out to the
length of many diets, and in a manner quite irreducible to
<PB N="236" REF="295">
the &s;hape of a jury-trial, as well as to the entire di&s;appoint|ment
of all tho&s;e rea&s;ons for which the charge is allowed
to commence in the civil Court, and to the occa&s;ioning of
tho&s;e very difficulties, both to Court and jury, which were
meant to be avoided by this cour&s;e of proce&s;s. Hence in
Raybould's ca&s;e, though the Lord Advocate con&s;ented to the
production of certain papers, which had been exhibited in
the civil Court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 18. 1768.</NOTE> but were not remitted, and of which the
pannel meant to avail him&s;elf towards &s;ome new defence;
this was <HI>ex mera gratia</HI> of the pro&s;ecutor, and was done under
prote&s;t entered in the record, that he &s;hould not be held to
have acquic&s;ced in the lawfulne&s;s of the demand. In the
later ca&s;e of David Reid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 12. 1780.</NOTE> the Lords on &s;uch an application
found, &startq;That it is not competent for the pannel to adduce
any proof, other or farther, in his exculpation or allevia|tion,
than what is contained in the decree of that Court,
referred to in the indictment, and therefore they refu&s;e to
allow the witne&s;&s;es to be examined.&endq;</P>
<P>Now here ari&s;es a que&s;tion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Decree of Se&s;|&s;ion; is it <HI>pro|batio probata?</HI></NOTE> both curious and important.
As the decree of the Lords of Se&s;&s;ion is thus the &s;ole evi|dence
which the pro&s;ecutor is allowed to produce; is it al&s;o
to be accounted conclu&s;ive and irrefragable evidence, (<HI>pro|batio
probata</HI>), according to which the jury are nece&s;&s;itated
to condemn; or are they at liberty to look into the depo|&s;itions
engro&s;&s;ed in the decree, and to acquit the pannel, if in
their mind the proof is not &s;ufficient to convict him? The
fir&s;t has been maintained; and in former times it &s;eems even
to have been the prevailing opinion on the &s;ubject. Macken|zie
has expre&s;sly &s;aid, that the decree is read for &s;ole pro|bation,
&startq;and that the a&s;&s;ize mu&s;t condemn thereupon, el&s;e
<PB N="237" REF="296">
they will be pur&s;ued for error;&endq; in confirmation of which
he el&s;ewhere adds<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Tit. Fal&s;ehood, No. 7. Tit. Juri&s;diction of Lords of Se&s;&s;ion, No. 3.</NOTE>, (but on this it is to be ob&s;erved, that no
&s;uch thing appears on the record), that in the ca&s;e of Bin|ning,
in 1662, the Lords refu&s;ed to receive a verdict of ac|quittal,
and obliged the a&s;&s;ize to reinclo&s;e and condemn.
Even in later times this opinion was not abandoned. It is
laid down as law by Er&s;kine<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Tit. Crimes, No. 72.</NOTE>; and in the ca&s;e of Margaret
Ni&s;bet, it was even endeavoured to be e&s;tabli&s;hed in a more
direct and palpable form, than had ever before been tried.
The libel in that ca&s;e concluded to have a relevancy found,
not only upon the pannel's guilt of the charge as made in
the libel, but al&s;o upon the mode of proof of her guilt, as by
the decree of the Court of Se&s;&s;ion <HI>per &s;e.</HI> The conclu&s;ion is in
the&s;e words:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 23. 1727.</NOTE> &startq;All which or any part thereof being found
proven again&s;t her the &s;aid Margaret Ni&s;bet, and particu|larly
it being <HI>found proven,</HI> that the &s;aid writings above
mentioned, or any of them, <HI>were found</HI> to be fabricated,
fal&s;e, or forged, <HI>by the &s;aid &s;entence</HI> of the Court of Se&s;|&s;ion,
and that &s;he was by <HI>the &s;ame &s;entence found guilty,</HI>
or art and part of the &s;aid forgeries, or any of them;
by the verdict of an a&s;&s;ize before our Lords Ju&s;tice-General,
Ju&s;tice-Clerk, and Commi&s;&s;ioners of Ju&s;ticiary,
&s;he ought to be puni&s;hed with the pains of death.&endq;
This was to a&s;k in plain terms, that the Court by their in|terlocutor,
&s;hould bind down the jury to convict upon the
&s;ingle ground, that &s;uch a decree had been given by the
Lords of Se&s;&s;ion. And to that effect the Lord Advocate
did urge his plea in the debate; appealing in &s;upport
of it to the con&s;tant &s;tyle of verdict in &s;uch ca&s;es, which
<PB N="238" REF="297">
had always been to convict the pannel &startq;in re&s;pect of the
decree of the Court of Se&s;&s;ion;&endq; &s;o that (&s;aid he), though
the &s;ame words and form of phra&s;e may not have been u&s;ed
in former libels, yet truly this was their &s;ub&s;tance and mean|ing.
As far as can be judged from the interlocutor upon
record<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Lords find, &startq;That the pannel being guilty of forging the bill and obliga|tion or declaration libelled, or that &s;he was art and part thereof, relevant to infer the pains of death,&endq; &amp;c.</NOTE>, the Court had been de&s;irous of avoiding to decide
on this debate; for it takes no notice of this conclu&s;ion ei|ther
way, but finds a relevancy in common &s;tyle, on the
pannel's being guilty, or art and part of forging the bill or
obligation libelled.</P>
<P>THE Lord Advocate had not, however, been di&s;couraged.
For the &s;ame form of libel was again u&s;ed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 26. 1731.</NOTE> and the &s;ame de|bate
aro&s;e, in the ca&s;e of John Campbell, where the pro&s;e|cutor
argued, that the jury are here in the &s;ame ca&s;e, as a
jury fitting on a felon who has returned from tran&s;portation,
or on a capital convict who has e&s;caped; which jury mu&s;t
find guilty in re&s;pect of the former verdict or &s;entence.<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 5. 1731.</NOTE> In|terlocutor
was again given in the like general terms, as in
the ca&s;e of Ni&s;bet; and the jury returned a verdict of <HI>guilty,</HI>
without taking notice of the decree, or a&s;&s;igning any ground
of their opinion<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">I learn from the notes already referred to, which were taken by the Sollici|tor-General at the time, Mr Charles Er&s;kine, that the Court had &s;poken on this point, and had differed in opinion. &startq;As to the &s;econd point pleaded, the Pre&s;ident of the Court, and one of the Judges, declared their opinion, that the jury were to be determined upon the point of proof, by the decree of the Lords of Se&s;|&s;ion. Two of them (N. M.) made a &s;ort of di&s;tinction, and &s;aid, that practice had &s;o far &s;ettled the matter, that there was no nece&s;&s;ity of examining the wit|ne&s;&s;es before the jury, the depo&s;itions being engro&s;&s;ed in the decree, but that it was entire to the a&s;&s;ize to examine the proof, how far they were &s;atisfied with it.&endq;</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="298">
I DO not find that the &s;ame conclu&s;ion has been in&s;erted
in any libel of a later date; and Maclaurin, in his report
of the ca&s;e of Raybould, mentions, That the Court were
agreed upon the right of the jury to acquit, if in their
own con&s;cience they &s;aw cau&s;e for it, as well as that in
this in&s;tance they did not rely on the authority of the
decree, but looked into the depo&s;itions, and were deter|mined
thereby in their verdict. It does not &s;eem probable,
that a different in&s;truction &s;hall be given on any future oc|ca&s;ion.
For as none of the rea&s;ons of commencing proce&s;s
in the civil Court, &s;eem to afford a ju&s;t inference to the &s;u|&s;taining
of their decree as conclu&s;ive of the i&s;&s;ue, but rather
as the report of a commi&s;&s;ion entru&s;ted to them by law, as
the body the mo&s;t capable of taking &s;uch a proof, and of
forming an opinion whether the pannel &s;hould be put upon
trial for his life, and as that body which at any rate has
right to <HI>improve</HI> the writings as to their civil effects; &s;o any
other opinion &s;eems &s;carcely to be reconcileable to the dig|nity
or the obligations of the office of an a&s;&s;ize.</P>
<P>FROM this que&s;tion ari&s;es another.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Decree Ab&s;olvi|tor of Se&s;&s;ion; does it hinder farther Trial.</NOTE> If the decree of the

proce&s;s brought again&s;t him in the criminal Court? I
do not find that this has ever been attempted, nor even that
any &s;uch opinion has ever been maintained. Having laid
his complaint, and taken his proof in that Court, and ac|cording
to that form, which is competent by cu&s;tom in the
trial of this crime, the pro&s;ecutor has joined i&s;&s;ue with the

of taking proof, mu&s;t abide by the deci&s;ion of the judicature,

pains of death; than on the jury to find the pannel guilty:
nay, according to Lord Roy&s;ton's notes upon that ca&s;e<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Tit. Fal&s;ehood, No. 25.</NOTE>, &s;o
generally had this opinion of Mackenzie's been taken to be
good law, that it was rather regarded as a novelty, and
gave ri&s;e to debate on the bench, when that Judge main|tained
the contrary at remitting her from the civil Court.
In truth, there were &s;everal things which had contributed
to &s;pread the belief of &s;uch a doctrine. It had been taught,
<PB N="241" REF="300">
and was received, that the Court of Ju&s;ticiary, in the fir&s;t in|&s;tance,
were not even competent to this &s;ort of trial, and
were only recurred to in capital ca&s;es, for the purpo&s;e of gi|ving
out a &s;entence, which no civil Court could give. An|ciently
too, the Court of Se&s;&s;ion had enjoyed a &s;ort of &s;upper|eminence
to the Court of Ju&s;ticiary, in virtue of which it
might be thought, that their opinion given upon any pro|ce&s;s
which they remitted to the other, &s;hould be bind|ing.
Farther, lawyers were affected by the ordinary cour&s;e
of capital judgment following upon remit; this being
only made in flagrant ca&s;es, and &s;uch where there was little
doubt of the propriety of inflicting the highe&s;t pains. In
truth, there were however &s;everal precedents to the contrary;
the ca&s;e of Strachan the me&s;&s;enger in 1605, of For&s;yth in
1638, and of Law&s;on in 1650, (not to mention that of Craig,
a fal&s;e witne&s;s, March 15. 1605); in all which ca&s;es only an
arbitrary puni&s;hment followed on the remit from the Lords
of Se&s;&s;ion. But even if there had been no &s;uch precedents,
Lord Roy&s;ton's remark would &s;till be ju&s;t, that it is not ea&s;y to
imagine, how in a capital matter, and one which is properly
of their own cogni&s;ance, a &s;overeign Court &s;hall be bound, to
the opinion of another judicature; and this difficulty will
appear the &s;tronger if it be con&s;idered, that not a majority
only, but all the Judges of the Court of Ju&s;ticiary, may
have been in the minority, as Judges of the Court of Se&s;&s;ion,
at remitting. The i&s;&s;ue was in the ca&s;e of Ni&s;bet, that in
the criminal Court the pro&s;ecutor did not much in&s;i&s;t on this
article of his libel; and that while the Judges thought upon
the ca&s;e it&s;elf, that the woman was de&s;erving of death, they
were however unanimou&s;ly of opinion, that they had right
to puni&s;h, as on other occa&s;ions, according to con&s;cience<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Lord Roy&s;ton's note, which is printed entire in the appendix.</NOTE>,

THOUGH &s;tatutes were requi&s;ite to warrant the pains of

(though the law of England in this re&s;pect may be differ|ent),
that the offence of forging the revenue &s;tamps is there|fore
entirely &s;tatutory, and cannot to any extent be pu|ni&s;hed
at common law. As &s;oon as any &s;tamp-act pa&s;&s;es,
this article of revenue is the lawful property of his Ma|je&s;ty

be thought that the&s;e are in the lea&s;t more excu&s;able, as

<P>THIS principle was exemplified in the ca&s;e of Brown

pains of death, the libel was found not relevant, by rea&s;on
of certain deviations from the &s;tatutory mode of affixing the
&s;tamp. Neverthele&s;s, as the mode actually practi&s;ed had
the authority of the Board of Cu&s;toms, and had been u&s;ed

devices, (if po&s;&s;ible &s;till more wicked), &s;tupified her and laid

<P>ANOTHER in&s;tance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;e of Elliot and Nicol&s;on.</NOTE> and in all re&s;pects a fit companion to

to, of Elliot, Nicol&s;on, and Maxwell, tried in January 1694.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="306">
DANIEL NICOLSON, writer in Edinburgh, was engaged in
an adulterous commerce with Marion Maxwell; and thence
aro&s;e a bitter enmity of both the&s;e per&s;ons to Jean Sands,
his lawful wife, and an earne&s;t de&s;ire to get rid of her, in
order that they might marry, or at lea&s;t enjoy their unlaw|ful
intercour&s;e more freely. Their fir&s;t intention was to
di&s;patch her by poi&s;on; and thus far they went in the pro|&s;ecution
of it, that they &s;educed a phy&s;ician in the &s;ame
city, Dr John Elliot, to furni&s;h them with poi&s;onous drugs,
to be applied to her per&s;on. This purpo&s;e did not however
&s;ucceed; though it appears that Elliot had put the drugs
for that purpo&s;e into the hands of Maxwell. They therefore
changed their plan for an equally wicked, but far more
complicated, and more hazardous contrivance, <HI>viz.</HI> a con|&s;piracy
to fix on Mrs Nicol&s;on, and on Margaret Sands, her
&s;i&s;ter, a de&s;ign of poi&s;oning Nicol&s;on, her hu&s;band. In pur|&s;uance
of this, equally wild as flagitious compact, they pro|ceeded
in the following manner. Nicol&s;on waits on the
Lord Advocate, Sir James Stewart, and acquaints him, as
in great &s;ecrecy, that his life is in danger from the attempts
of his wife and her &s;i&s;ter, who have conceived a ground|le&s;s
&s;u&s;picion of adultery between him and Marion Max|well;
and he adds, that he has certain knowledge of the thing
from the information of Dr Elliot, to whom they had ap|plied
for poi&s;on, and who, being filled with horror at &s;uch a
propo&s;al, had come and revealed it to him and Maxwell.
This &s;tory he lays before the Advocate in &s;uch artful man|ner,
as completely to deceive him; and he a&s;ks advice of
him how to proceed for his &s;afety. The Lord Advocate
&s;ends for Elliot, who confirms the whole particulars, and
adds that the two &s;i&s;ters &s;eem immea&s;urably de&s;irous to have
the poi&s;on: On the que&s;tion being a&s;ked, he even ventures to
<PB N="248" REF="307">
&s;ay, that he believes they will not &s;cruple to give a receipt
for the poi&s;on, &s;pecifying the u&s;e to which it is to be ap|plied.
In con&s;equence, he receives an in&s;truction from
the Lord Advocate, to furni&s;h the poi&s;on, and take &s;uch a
receipt from them if they will give it, and in&s;tantly to
bring it to him when obtained. In giving this direction,
the Lord Advocate's intention was to &s;end and &s;ecure the
poi&s;on in the hands of Mrs Nicol&s;on, and to provide evi|dence
at the &s;ame time, of the mortal purpo&s;e for which &s;he
had procured it. The con&s;pirators intended &s;ecretly to
convey the drugs into Mrs Nicol&s;on's repo&s;itories; &s;o that
they might be found there upon &s;earch.</P>
<P>SOME farther intercour&s;e relative to the terms of the re|ceipt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;e of Elliot and Nicol&s;on.</NOTE>
took place with Elliot in the cour&s;e of the &s;ucceeding
days. And the re&s;ult was, that, in a &s;hort time, Elliot re|turned
to the Lord Advocate, with a receipt for the poi&s;on,
under the hands of Jean and Margaret Sands, and in the terms
de&s;ired. In truth, this receipt was forged. Warrant however
immediately i&s;&s;ues on it, to apprehend the two women. By
this means the charge becomes public; and in con&s;equence
a fame ari&s;es, owing to the known evil character and &s;can|dalous
conduct of Nicol&s;on and Maxwell, that the whole
&s;tory is a lie, and a &s;oul con&s;piracy of tho&s;e adulterous para|mours,
to de&s;troy his lawful &s;pou&s;e. In &s;hort, one circum|&s;tance
tran&s;piring after another, Elliot is alarmed and con|fe&s;&s;es;
and the i&s;&s;ue is, that all three are brought to the bar,
charged with the forgery and u&s;e of the receipt, the de&s;ign
to poi&s;on, and the fal&s;ehood and con&s;piracy to fix that crime
upon Jean and Margaret Sands. Nicol&s;on and Maxwell are
farther charged with the crime of notour adultery. Elliot
is found guilty of forging and u&s;ing the fal&s;e receipt, of the
<PB N="249" REF="308">
con&s;piracy again&s;t Jean and Margaret Sands, and of furni&s;h|ing
the poi&s;on; Nicol&s;on and Maxwell are convicted of no|tour
adultery, and of u&s;ing the fal&s;e receipt: And all three
have &s;entence of death; which is put in execution. It is
to be ob&s;erved, that the con&s;piracy to fix the &s;u&s;picion of an
intent to poi&s;on upon Jean and Margaret Sands, <HI>jointly</HI> with
the act of furni&s;hing poi&s;on, with intent to de&s;troy the for|mer

which could hardly, in any civili&s;ed country, be &s;uppo&s;ed to
be beyond the reach of the common law. But it is the genius
of our practice equally to extend its attention to the inferior
offences of the &s;ame general cla&s;s. Thus, on the 5th Fe|bruary

as well at common law<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">&startq;And farther, by the laws of this and other well governed realms, a per|&s;on taking upon him to act as a mini&s;ter or clergyman, and as &s;uch celebrating a marriage, or &s;igning an atte&s;tation or certificate thereof, under a fal&s;e or a&s;|&s;umed name, e&s;pecially when one of the parties &s;o pretended to have been married, was formerly married to another &s;pou&s;e.

doubted with re&s;pect to the fal&s;e a&s;&s;umption of any official
character, for the purpo&s;e of breaking any point of public
di&s;cipline or order, that this &s;candalous impo&s;ture falls un|der
the reprehen&s;ion of the Magi&s;trate, without, aid of any
&s;tatute directed again&s;t it.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame is even true of tho&s;e offences,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Fraud or Swindling.</NOTE> of a pure pri|vate
and patrimonial nature, which fall under the de&s;crip|tion
of what is known in England by the name of Swind|ling,
and is committed by &s;ome fal&s;e a&s;&s;umption of name,
character, commi&s;&s;ion, or errand, for the purpo&s;e of obtain|ing
goods or money, or other valuable thing, to the offend|er's
profit. With re&s;pect to tricks or frauds of this &s;ort;
the more profitable market of England, and its more artificial
and punctilious &s;y&s;tem of law, have obliged our neighbours
to guard again&s;t them as they ari&s;e (in which &s;hape the re|medy
is always imperfect), by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive provi&s;ions of the
Legi&s;lature. But as the&s;e do not extend to, &s;o neither are
they nece&s;&s;ary in this country, where the common law takes
cogni&s;ance of, and competently puni&s;hes all &s;uch practices,
as frauds and fal&s;ehoods of a criminal nature.</P>
<P>I SHALL mention two late examples:<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 31. and Aug. 1. 1786.</NOTE> the ca&s;e of James
Grahame, and that of Thomas Hall; both of whom were
adjudged to be tran&s;ported.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 12 Feb. 6. July 20. 21.</NOTE> The former had obtained mo|ney
from &s;everal un&s;u&s;pecting per&s;ons, under pretence of
having lately &s;een their relations abroad, and being the bearer
of pre&s;ents to them from tho&s;e relations, which, as he alleged,
were on board the ve&s;&s;el with him, and had put him to
charges in the payment of freight and the like; in &s;upport
of which fable he &s;howed pretended bills of loading and
other vouchers. The libel was laid on a &s;tatute as well as at
common law, but was only &s;u&s;tained upon the latter.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="310">
THE &s;ub&s;tance of the charge again&s;t Hall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">FRAUD AND CHEATING.</NOTE> was the ob|taining
of goods from various dealers under the fal&s;e pre|tence
of &s;etting up &s;hop in Edinburgh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;es of Fraud or Cheating.</NOTE> and having a trade
there to carry on. The man had indeed hired a &s;hop, as
if with the view of trading; and the better to procure a far|ther
credit, he had even paid in part for the goods which he
received. But in truth he was no trader, but a practi&s;ed
cheat, and never meant to carry on traffic as a &s;hopkeeper,
but to procure and run off with the goods; which in due
time he did, leaving the &s;hop furni&s;hed with a &s;how of
fictitious bales and empty boxes, to deceive for a time &s;uch
as might enquire about him. The ca&s;e was thus di&s;tingui&s;h|ed
from the pure civil wrong of failure to pay for goods ob|tained
on credit, in that the whole circum&s;tances of the
&s;tory, the coming to Edinburgh, the hiring and opening
&s;hop there, the a&s;&s;umed name of trader, and even any bu|&s;ine&s;s
done by him as &s;uch, were no more than the detail of
one original, fal&s;e, and fraudulent purpo&s;e, to obtain and
run off with the goods, unpaid. The &s;tatute of the 30th
Geo. II. c. 24. on which al&s;o the libel had been laid, was
found not to extend to Scotland.</P>
<P>A PRIOR ca&s;e of the like complexion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;es of Fraud or Cheating.</NOTE> and judged upon
the &s;ame grounds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 19. 1765.</NOTE> is that of Mathew Jack and Humphry
Ewing. The&s;e per&s;ons were dealers in tobacco, and were
in the u&s;e of exporting that commodity; on which occa&s;ion
they had drawback of the duties paid at importing. To
a&s;certain the amount of the drawback, the tobaccoes were
weighed in their pre&s;ence, and that of the King's officers,
and with the King's weights; which were fixed to the balance
with a chain, &s;ecured with a padlock, of which the King's
officers kept the key. But this &s;ecurity the pannels had
<PB N="252" REF="311">
contrived to get the better of. They regularly, in the
night, before the weighing of their own tobacco, picked
the lock of the padlock, and detached certain of the King's
weights, and &s;ub&s;tituted an equal number of their own, con|&s;iderably
&s;hort of weight, but in appearance like the other.
With the&s;e their tobaccoes were weighed; and thus they
fal&s;ely and fraudulently gained the drawback on a greater
weight than they exported, to the extent, it appeared, of
28 lb. in a hog&s;head. After &s;erving their purpo&s;e, the fal&s;e
weights were again withdrawn in the night, and the King's
weights were replaced. The&s;e per&s;ons had &s;entence to be
&s;courged at the market-cro&s;&s;es of Gla&s;gow and Greenock,
and to be drummed out of tho&s;e towns.</P>
<P>ONE ca&s;e more &s;hall be &s;tated in illu&s;tration of this &s;alu|tary
rule;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;es of Fraud or Cheating.</NOTE>&mdash;The ca&s;e of George Macfarlane, merchant in
Gla&s;gow, who was tried there before Lord Roy&s;ton, on the
10th of May 1733, at in&s;tance of William Alexander, mer|chant
in Edinburgh. The libel bore, that having &s;old cer|tain
hog&s;heads of tobacco to Michael and Thomas Wallace,
as agents for Alexander, and having in their pre&s;ence mark|ed
the&s;e hog&s;heads for him, he afterwards either transferred
the marks to other hog&s;heads of tobacco of inferior quality,

<P>ACCORDING to the principles of our practice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;es of Fraud or Cheating.</NOTE> it would be
no impeachment of the&s;e judgments, which are all of mo|dern
date, that they were even the fir&s;t of the kind, and
were pronounced upon offences of a new &s;pecies, of which
no re&s;emblance is to be found in our older practice. But
they have the authority of at lea&s;t one judgment of an an|cient
date; though perhaps the charge would have been al&s;o
relevant under the name of theft. In March 1634, James
Clerk, &startq;brou&s;ter at the Wa&s;t-Port of Edinburgh,&endq; was tried
upon a libel, whereof the 4th article charges him with the
<HI>cozenage</HI> of one James Moubray in Calder. It relates, that
Moubray had &s;ent his &s;ervant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 18. &amp; 19. 1634.</NOTE> James Doig, with his &s;word,
worth L. 20, to one &startq;Robert Moubray, &s;word-&s;lippir, dwel|land
outwith the Wa&s;t-Port of Edinburgh, to be dight and
dre&s;&s;it.&endq; Doig neither knew the &s;word-&s;lipper, nor had
ever been at his hou&s;e. So, going along, with the &s;word in
his hand, he meets the pannel, al&s;o a &s;tranger to him, of
whom he enquires the way to Moubray's hou&s;e, and at the
&s;ame time tells him his errand. The pannel directs him to
go by the We&s;t-Port. Meanwhile, he ha&s;tens home by a
&s;hort way; di&s;gui&s;es his per&s;on, by means of a cloak thrown
about him, and certain other contrivances; and getting
to the We&s;t-Port before Doig, he waits there for his co|ming.
On his arrival, he again acco&s;ts him, and a&s;ks him
whom he &s;eeks. &startq;Robert Moubray &s;word-&s;lipper,&endq; an&s;wers
he. Then quoth Clerk, &startq;<HI>I am the man.</HI>&endq; And thus he gets
the &s;word, which he turns to his own u&s;es. He is charg|ed
as being withall &startq;ane coo&s;enar, trickir, fraudulent and
<PB N="254" REF="313">
fal&s;e man, and abu&s;ir of hone&s;t per&s;ons, by fraudful and
di&s;hone&s;t meanis.&endq;</P>
<P>THE pannel's plea to this charge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;es of Fraud or Cheating.</NOTE> is entered in the&s;e
words: &startq;As to the fourt article anent the pannell's alledgit
coo&s;anadge, it is an&s;werit by the pannell, his prolocutors,

And quh^r it is lybellit, that the pannell is a common
coo&s;enar, <HI>una hirundo non facit ver,</HI> and this is but <HI>ca&s;us &s;in|gularis:</HI>

&s;ub&s;tance, that the crime contained in the 4th article, is a
crime puni&s;hable of the law,&mdash;the <HI>crimen fal&s;i,</HI> of which the
pannel is guilty by a&s;&s;uming the name of Robert Moubray,
and thereby deceiving Doig; but that he is content that the
pannel's puni&s;hment, if he be found guilty, &s;hall be in <HI>arbi|trio

to be arbitrarie, excluding lyf and lym.&endq; The man
was convicted, and remitted to the Privy Council for his
&s;entence; but what this was does not appear in the record.</P>
<P>WE have, however, in this century, &s;ome in&s;tances of
pro&s;ecution for a new &s;pecies of fraud and fal&s;ehood, very
remote from any thing which the le&s;s fertile invention of our
ance&s;tors had devi&s;ed. One in&s;tance is the ca&s;e of Maciver
and Macallum, tried before the Judge-Admiral in July 1784,
for a fraudulent combination to cheat the in&s;urers of a cer|tain
&s;hip and cargo, by privately relanding part of the in&s;ured
<PB N="255" REF="314">
goods, and &s;inking the &s;hip upon the voyage; for which pur|po&s;e
certain plug-holes bored in the bottom of the ve&s;&s;el
had actually been un&s;topped, &s;o that the ve&s;&s;el was beginning
to fill, when it was captured by an enemy. In this way, the
di&s;covery was made, and the &s;hip &s;aved from &s;inking; but the
pannels had proceeded to recover from the underwriters,
the full &s;ums in&s;ured upon the &s;hip and cargo. For this
complicated fraud and fal&s;ehood the Judge-Admiral con|demned
them to pillory and bani&s;hment upon the ground
of common law; and this judgment, when brought under
review by &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, the Court of Ju&s;ticiary confirmed;
having expre&s;sly found<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">&startq;Find, that the &s;tatutes of the 4th and 11th Geo. I. libelled on, do not ex|tend to Scotland; but find that the libel, as laid upon the common law, was rightly found by the interlocutor of the Judge-Admiral relevant to infer an arbitrary puni&s;hment; and find that the verdict of the jury, as applied to that interlocutor, does warrant the judgment of the Judge-Admiral which pa&s;&s;ed upon it; and upon con&s;idering the atrocity and dangerous nature of the crime &s;o charged and proved again&s;t the complainers, find that there is no ju&s;t ground for mitigating that judgment; and repel the whole rea&s;ons of &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, and refu&s;e the bill.&endq;</NOTE> that certain &s;tatutes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 21. 1784.</NOTE> on which as
well as on the common law the libel had been laid, and which
the Admiral had di&s;regarded as inapplicable to the ca&s;e,
did not extend to Scotland at all.</P>
<P>THE like offence of making high in&s;urance on a ve&s;&s;el,
and wilfully ca&s;ting it away with intent to prejudice the
in&s;urers, was by the Judge-Admiral found relevant to in|fer
an arbitrary puni&s;hment at common law, in the ca&s;e
of James Macnair, on the 14th March 1751; which &s;eems
to have been our fir&s;t trial of this &s;ort. But a conviction
was not obtained. This article will be treated more at
large, under the head of crimes injurious to trade.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="315">
IT were vain to think of enumerating the many and va|rious
forms of cheating or fraud,<NOTE PLACE="marg">U&s;e of fal&s;e Weights and Mea&s;ures.</NOTE> in which fal&s;ehood is one
of the chief ingredients of the guilt, and a cau&s;e of pro&s;e|cution.
The in&s;tances which have been given may &s;erve as
an illu&s;tration of the &s;ettled principle of our practice, and
as a ground of inference to other ca&s;es of the like cozenage
and circumvention. I &s;hall therefore mention but one other
&s;ort of fal&s;ehood, the ea&s;ie&s;t perhaps and mo&s;t familiar of
any, and which accordingly has not been left to the pure
care of the common law: I mean that which is committed
by the u&s;e of fal&s;e weights and mea&s;ures, whereby the lieges,
and e&s;pecially the mean and indigent, are cheated in their
daily and nece&s;&s;ary traffic for the many commodities which
are di&s;po&s;ed of in that way. This is acknowledged as a
point of dittay in the Leges Burg. c. 74. which place the
offender's life and limb in the King's will for the fourth of|fence;
in the acts 1493, c. 47. and 1607, c. 2. the la&s;t of
which inflicts the pain of e&s;cheat of moveables, and the
other orders the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors to be puni&s;hed as fal&s;ars; and
in the act 1661, c. 38. which commits the care of this mat|ter
(formerly appertaining to the Chamberlain's department),
to the Ju&s;tices of the Peace, and Magi&s;trates of burghs, and
more e&s;pecially to the Dean of Guild.</P>
<P>THESE things &s;eem to be nece&s;&s;ary for involving the accu|&s;ed
in the guilt of this offence. 1<HI>&s;t,</HI> The deficiency of weight
or mea&s;ure mu&s;t be manife&s;t and material, &s;uch as is injurious
to the cu&s;tomer, and cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to pa&s;s unob&s;erved
on the part of the u&s;er. Hence, verdict being returned again&s;t
Andrew Cochrane in a circuit Court at Ayr,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 10. 1671.</NOTE> finding &startq;the
&s;aid Andrew Cochrane, his weights proven light as to his
&s;tone and quarter weight, but the quantity not proven what
they wanted, and his mea&s;ures proven &s;hort, but not the
<PB N="257" REF="316">
quantity what they want;&endq;<NOTE PLACE="marg">FALSE WEIGHTS, &amp;c.</NOTE> and this verdict being refer|red
to the whole Court, &startq;they fand the verdict of a&s;&s;ize
both unclear and di&s;conform to the dittay,&endq; and therefore
a&s;&s;oilzied the pannel: for the deficiency might not be &s;uch
as to infer the pannel's wrong, <HI>2dly,</HI> The fal&s;e weights
mu&s;t have been u&s;ed and given out for the true ones, (but
this may be done tacitly, and will be pre&s;umed again&s;t
the u&s;er), and the traffic have been carried on according|ly.
3<HI>dly,</HI> They mu&s;t be charged to be different from the
legal &s;tandard: for if the charge is only of a deviation
from the cu&s;tomary weight or mea&s;ure of that neighbour|hood
or di&s;trict, (a thing for which there is no rule nor au|thority),
this of it&s;elf, and without farther accu&s;ation of
&s;ome &s;pecial device and dole, by which deception has been
occa&s;ioned, does not &s;eem to be a relevant charge.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 11. 1714.</NOTE> And &s;o
it was found in the ca&s;e of Sir James Dunbar and John For|&s;yth.<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Augu&s;t II. 1714. &startq;Found the fourth article, <HI>viz.</HI> That Sir James u&s;ed a half peck mea&s;ure, for receiving the fractions of his rent from his tenants, dif|ferent from the mea&s;ure commonly u&s;ed in that country; and likewi&s;e the fifth article, <HI>viz.</HI> That For&s;yth u&s;ed a half firlot for receiving his officer's corn or Yule bannock, different from the mea&s;ure commonly u&s;ed in that country, <HI>not</HI> relevant to infer a crime.&endq;</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN &s;trictne&s;s it is even a point of dittay (1503, c. 96.) to
make u&s;e of any weight or mea&s;ure different from tho&s;e
which national authority has e&s;tabli&s;hed. And if this ap|pointment
cannot every where be executed, by rea&s;on of the
long practice and known cu&s;tom of certain counties or di|&s;tricts
to the contrary, it is not however to be imagined
that the law is therefore ob&s;olete, nor that in other quarters
of the kingdom, or with re&s;pect to other commodities,
which have not been &s;ubject to any &s;uch irregularity, a li|cence
<PB N="258" REF="317">
has been gained of dealing by various or arbitrary
weights or mea&s;ures, &s;uch as are of no known proportion, and
are not reducible to any &s;tandard. For this loo&s;e practice is
again&s;t all equality or fairne&s;s of dealing, and is at variance
with our whole train of ordinances, as well as with the prac|tice
of all the countries of Europe, and their intere&s;t in
traffic with each other.</P>
<P>I HAVE found but one conviction of this offence in the
books of adjournal. On the 30th July 1629, William
Brownlee, miller at Cairnbrue, was convicted of u&s;ing a
mea&s;ure, or fourth part of a peck, to receive his multure,
larger than that which he made u&s;e of in receiving the
corn to be grinded in his mill. But the a&s;&s;ize at the &s;ame
time acquitted him of the making of this mea&s;ure, which
he had found in the mill at his entry; and he was therefore
only condemned to pay a fine of 100 merks, and to find
caution to ab&s;tain from the u&s;e of the mea&s;ure in time to
come.</P>
<P>IT is &s;ub&s;tantially the &s;ame offence with this, if a dealer
in any commodity, &s;uch as bread, which has a known
weight a&s;&s;igned it by public authority, &s;hall make and ex|po&s;e
it of a lower weight. On this head there is the fol|lowing

<HEAD>CHAPTER VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">OF HOMICIDE.</HEAD>
<P>WE are now to enter on that cla&s;s of crimes which
are injurious to the per&s;on;<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VI. Of Homicide.</NOTE> and among the&s;e I &s;hall
begin with that one, the highe&s;t of any, and of which na|ture
has mo&s;t abhorrence, the crime of homicide, by which
life is taken away, and the per&s;on of a human creature is de|&s;troyed.
The order I &s;hall ob&s;erve in treating of this, equally
exten&s;ive as important part of our &s;ubject, will be, by fir&s;t
enquiring concerning tho&s;e things which are common to all
homicide, and afterwards proceeding to di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;e|veral
degrees of homicide, one from another.</P>
<P>I. FIRST,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Attempt to mur|der not capital.</NOTE> it is nece&s;&s;ary to all conviction of homicide,
that a per&s;on have been actually killed. In this I mean to
&s;ay, that no attempt to kill will come under the de&s;cription,
or expo&s;e to the proper pains of homicide, how deliberate
&s;oever the purpo&s;e, or how cruel the means employed, and
how little &s;oever it be owing to remor&s;e or want of re&s;olution
on the part of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, that he has failed of &s;ucce&s;s.
Nay, though the attempt have in a great mea&s;ure &s;ucceeded,
and the party have received a wound which brings him to
<PB N="261" REF="320">
the brink of the grave, and leaves him infirm for the re|mainder
of his life, &s;till the benignity of our practice will
con&s;ider, that the man is not lo&s;t to &s;ociety, and will allow
the offender an opportunity to repent, and to make atone|ment
for his crime.</P>
<P>OF this, our well known rule, no &s;tronger in&s;tance needs
be mentioned than the ca&s;e of James Mitchell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 9. 1678.</NOTE> who, in
attempting to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate Sharpe, the Archbi&s;hop of St An|drew's,
(for whom he had lain in wait to di&s;patch him with
a pi&s;tol, as he was &s;tepping into his coach at the head of
Blackfriars-wynd, in the city of Edinburgh), inflicted a
&s;evere and painful wound on the Bi&s;hop of Orkney, under
which he langui&s;hed for years, and continued infirm and
ailing till the time of his death. Now, in the trial of
Mitchell for this offence, &s;o far as the libel was laid at com|mon
law, and not on a certain &s;tatute, by which it is capi|tal
even to a&s;&s;ault a privy coun&s;ellor on account of &s;ervice
done the King, the charge was found only relevant to infer
an arbitrary pain<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">&startq;And &s;icklike that article of the dittay, anent the invading, wounding and mutilating of the Bi&s;hop of Orkney, relevant to infer an arbitrary puni&s;h|ment.&endq;</NOTE>. Yet, that the &s;hot did not take place
upon the per&s;on at whom it was aimed, could not have af|fected
the judgment of the Court with re&s;pect to the pains
of law for &s;uch an attempt, if in it&s;elf it had been a capital
offence. A few years after, on occa&s;ion of the murder of
Sharpe, a &s;tatute was indeed made, the act 1681, c. 15.
which denounces the pains of trea&s;on not only again&s;t a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;ins,
but again&s;t all who &s;hall a&s;&s;ert that it is lawful to kill up|on
difference of opinion, or on account of &s;ervice done to the
King, or to the e&s;tabli&s;hed church. And from the latter part
of this enactment, occa&s;ion might have been taken to argue,
that for the higher offence of attempting to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate, or to
<PB N="262" REF="321">
kill <HI>per in&s;idias et indu&s;triam,</HI> (for this with us &s;eems to have
been the con&s;truction of that term), the offender could not
e&s;cape with a lighter pain. But this &s;tatute has been taken
away, in con&s;equence of the general alteration of the Scot|ti&s;h
&s;y&s;tem of trea&s;on law<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>See the ca&s;e of John Murray, 9th Augu&s;t 1703, where attempt to murder, laid to be done in the way of in&s;idiating, and by firing with a gun, and thru&s;ting with a &s;word, is found only relevant to infer an arbitrary pain.</P>
<P>On the 8th March 1756, John Ogilvy for &s;tabbing a per&s;on with a knife, in the belly, and giving him a dangerous wound, was adjudged to be tran&s;ported for life.</P>
<P>On the 8th July 1771, Thomas Young had the like &s;entence, on conviction of &s;tabbing Henry Balnairs in the &s;ide, with a knife, as he lay a&s;leep. The man's life was only &s;aved by the knife &s;triking a rib.</P>
<P>They have a &s;tatute in England by which it is a capital crime to &s;hoot at a per&s;on with intent to kill. But it does not extend to this country.</P>.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE only controver&s;y on this head,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Attempt to poi|&s;on, if capital.</NOTE> of which it is worth
while to take particular notice, relates to the ca&s;e of an at|tempt
to poi&s;on; in regard to which, Mackenzie<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">B. 1. tit. 8. No. 5. and 6.</NOTE> hath &s;aid
that it may be puni&s;hed with death; at lea&s;t in aggravated
ca&s;es, as when directed again&s;t a parent, a magi&s;trate, or a
matter. But the &s;tatutes 1450, c. 31. and 32. upon which
chiefly this opinion is grounded, have no relation to the
u&s;ers, but only to the homebringers of poi&s;on; be&s;ides, that
even in the matter to which they properly related, the rigour
of tho&s;e laws does not appear to have been in any in&s;tance
applied. It is true, re&s;pecting the attempt to poi&s;on a pa|rent,
that this opinion may farther be &s;trengthened by the
example of the Roman practice, which &s;eems to have puni&s;hed
the child with death, who bought poi&s;on with the purpo&s;e of
<PB N="263" REF="322">
admini&s;tering it to the father, <HI>quamvis non potuerit dare.</HI>
But notwith&s;tanding the extreme depravity of &s;uch a pur|po&s;e,
it does not &s;eem to be certain, that upon this &s;ingle
authority, which is borrowed from a &s;tate of manners, and
of dome&s;tic di&s;cipline, very different from ours, we &s;hall be
di&s;po&s;ed to judge in this in&s;tance, contrary to the general
analogy of our law. Upon the ordinary and le&s;s atrocious
ca&s;e, two judgments have been given. In the noted trial of
Dr Elliot,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 15. 1694.</NOTE> an attempt to poi&s;on was found relevant to infer
the pains of death, but only in conjunction with a mo&s;t malig|nant
con&s;piracy to fix the guilt of that crime upon two inno|cent
per&s;ons<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">&startq;As al&s;o, find the pannells giveing poy&s;on to Marion Maxwell the other pannell, at her de&s;ire, to be applyed to the body of Jean Sands, &s;pou&s;e to Da|niel Niccol&s;on, <HI>with</HI> the endeavouring to fix a <HI>de&s;ign</HI> upon the &s;aid Jean Sands and her &s;i&s;ter of poy&s;ioning the &s;aid Daniel Niccol&s;on, another of the pannells, relevant to infer the pains labelled.&endq;</NOTE>. And in the later ca&s;e of Walter Buchannan
of Balquhan,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 15. 1728.</NOTE> who was charged with two attempts to poi|&s;on
Jean Dougal, liferenter of part of his e&s;tate, this article,

his death following afterwards, which in the&s;e circum&s;tan|ces
mu&s;t be pre&s;umed to be from &s;ome other cau&s;e, &s;hould
be the ground of a charge of murder. Judgment was gi|ven
to that purpo&s;e in the ca&s;e of Patrick Kinninmonth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 22. 1697.</NOTE> up|on

<P>But even ca&s;es of a far more delicate nature mu&s;t be de|cided
in the &s;ame way. In a combat between John and
James, John receives a wound of that &s;ort which either
may or may not prove mortal, and James flies for his &s;afe|ty,
and leaves John upon the field, to the care of his own
friend. If in the&s;e circum&s;tances they are &s;urpri&s;ed by
ruffians, who &s;trip and rob John, and beat out his brains;
no charge of homicide will on that account lie again&s;t
James, who&s;e act has indeed given occa&s;ion to the cata&s;|trophe,
but is not the act by which John has been killed.
Or again: a per&s;on of a weakly habit receives a wound, of
which, after &s;ome &s;pace of time he is cured; but owing to
the pain and confinement, he is taken ill of a con&s;umption
or other malady incident to a &s;tate of weakne&s;s; and of
this he dies. It may be very true, that the author of this
calamity has great cau&s;e of compunction and di&s;tre&s;s of

in this world mu&s;t lie. Inferences of this kind are
by far too remote, and too uncertain, to be made the grounds
of judgment in human tribunals; and as even in the civil
que&s;tion of deathbed, tho&s;e ailments would on that account

from the pannel is only one circum&s;tance among others which
have contributed to the fatal i&s;&s;ue, and is &s;uch whereof it can|not
be well a&s;certained, what its own proper operation in the
ca&s;e has been. There are for in&s;tance many &s;ituations of di&s;|ea&s;e,
in which any &s;udden di&s;turbance and alarm, or a cup of
cold water, or a gla&s;s of &s;pirits improperly admini&s;tered, may
produce a great and unfavourable change in the &s;tate of the
patient; who in the end dies. Yet even on the &s;uppo&s;ition that
the thing is wickedly done, it will &s;till be very difficult to
convict the offender of murder; becau&s;e the di&s;ea&s;e it&s;elf is
here the main and primary cau&s;e, and it cannot be &s;hown
with that certainty of which the law is de&s;irous in &s;uch
enquiries, that it has only proved mortal, owing to this ad|ventitious
circum&s;tance. Thus William Duff of Braco and

<P>THESE things have been received in favour of the pannel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What if the Per|&s;on killed was on Deathbed.</NOTE>
to avoid the po&s;&s;ibility of doing him inju&s;tice. But it is no
le&s;s requi&s;ite to the due pro&s;ecution of the guilty, that this
rule be al&s;o circum&s;cribed on the other &s;ide, and that no ex|ception
be admitted of any &s;ituation, where the death of the
decea&s;ed is the plain and direct con&s;equence of that which
is done to him by the pannel, what&s;oever in other re&s;pects
be the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e. There are two de&s;crip|tions
of charge, which fall under this rule of judgment.
One con&s;i&s;ts of tho&s;e ca&s;es, where it may be argued, that
the decea&s;ed was at any rate in a dying condition, and, ac|cording
to the cour&s;e of nature, had but a &s;hort time to live.
And there can be no doubt, that the &s;layer has not in that
circum&s;tance any manner of defence. If a per&s;on who is
old and bed-rid, or in the la&s;t &s;tage of a mortal di&s;ea&s;e,
&s;hall be &s;tabbed with a lethal weapon, or knocked in the
head with a &s;take, this is equally murder as to de&s;troy in
the &s;ame manner one who is in the vigour of years and
health. Upon the i&s;&s;ue of di&s;ea&s;es, it belongs to none
but unto God to determine; and granting that a certain
judgment could even be formed concerning the event, &s;till
<PB N="268" REF="327">
it is true, (and therefore the charge of homicide mu&s;t
be good), that the pannel hath actually taken his neigh|bour's
life; a deed in which there is no difference of de|gree
from the amount of the harm which is thereby done,
but only from the motive which impels to it. Upon this
matter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 12. &amp; 24. 1713.</NOTE> the ca&s;e of Jean Ram&s;ay is an authority in point.
The libel relates, that Robert Ram&s;ay, a &s;ickly and infirm
per&s;on, being found lying upon the &s;treet of Leith, was chari|tably
carried from thence into the pannel's hou&s;e, and laid
upon a bed; from which the pannel, on coming home, vio|lently
dragged him, and beat him with a pair of tongs; and
that &s;he repeated this u&s;age when he was laid upon the bed a
&s;econd time; whereby, in a few hours he died. This was
found a relevant charge to infer the crime of murder<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">&startq;The Lords find the pannel's violently dragging the defunct Robert Ram|&s;ay, a weak and infirm per&s;on, out of the bed on which he was laid, &s;o that his head was bled on the bed-&s;tock or floor, and her beating of him on the &s;$de with a pair of tongs, and her <HI>again</HI> dragging him out of another bed, whereon he was afterwards laid, and his dying within a few hours thereafter, about the time libelled, <HI>jointly,</HI> relevant to infer the pains of death, and con&s;i&s;cation of all her moveable goods and gear; and find any of the fore&s;aid facts, &s;eparately, relevant to infer an arbitrary puni&s;hment.&endq;</NOTE>;
though it was argued for the pannel, that the event was ra|ther
to be a&s;cribed to the previous condition of the man. She
was not, however, convicted of the violence, in the extent
which the interlocutor required; and therefore &s;he e&s;caped
with &s;entence of bani&s;hment and &s;courging.</P>
<P>THE other cla&s;s of ca&s;es are &s;uch,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What if the Wound might have been cu|red?</NOTE> concerning which it
may be argued or conjectured, that in more favourable cir|cum&s;tances
than tho&s;e in which the violence was offered, the
injury might not have had a mortal i&s;&s;ue. And in gene|ral
it &s;eems to be true, that as little can there be any al|lowance
<PB N="269" REF="328">
of this &s;ort of plea. If an a&s;&s;ault is made with a
knife, or other cutting weapon, whereby &s;ome artery or
blood-ve&s;&s;el is divided, and the per&s;on bleeds to death upon
the &s;pot; it is no an&s;wer to the charge of homicide, that of
it&s;elf the wound was not nece&s;&s;arily mortal, and that with
the in&s;tant a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a &s;urgeon, if he could have been
procured, the effu&s;ion of blood might have been &s;topped,
and the man's life pre&s;erved. Or put the ca&s;e, that a &s;ur|geon
is procured, who &s;taunches the blood for the time, but
that after his departure the wound breaks out a-fre&s;h, and
the man dies before a&s;&s;i&s;tance can again be had; this inci|dent
al&s;o is at the hazard of the pannel. Or what if a per|&s;on
receive a gun&s;hot-wound at &s;ome remote place in the
country, where no &s;urgeon &s;killed in the treatment of &s;uch
wounds is to be had, and of which wound he dies, notwith|&s;tanding
the be&s;t care of the practitioners in that quarter.
Or let us imagine that a per&s;on is robbed, and unmercifully
beaten under night, in &s;evere weather, and in a &s;olitary
place, &s;o that lying expo&s;ed to the cold throughout the
night, he dies upon the &s;pot, or of the con&s;equences &s;hortly
after. In all the&s;e, and the like ca&s;es, there is an undoubt|ed
homicide. It is &s;till true, that of this very injury, done
him by the pannel, the per&s;on dies. It has had its natural
cour&s;e and i&s;&s;ue, in the circum&s;tances of the &s;ituation, &s;uch
as they happened to be where the pannel did the deed, and
which the party &s;uffering has done nothing to aggravate,
and every thing in his power to relieve. If the&s;e have been
unfavourable, this he mu&s;t an&s;wer and run the ri&s;k of, who&s;e
malicious deed, then and there done, has made them of mo|ment
to the lo&s;s or pre&s;ervation of the life of a fellow
creature. Be&s;ides, the uncertainty mu&s;t be con&s;idered,
which always hangs about &s;uch ca&s;es of great and outrage|ous
<PB N="270" REF="329">
injury, whether by any cour&s;e of treatment, the life of
the per&s;on could have been &s;aved. The actual de&s;truction
of him by this violence is proved; and that he would have
&s;urvived in more favourable circum&s;tances, is matter of
conjecture only, or of probability at the be&s;t.</P>
<P>ONE ca&s;e which &s;erves in &s;ome mea&s;ure to illu&s;trate this
rule,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What if the Wound might have been cured. June 30. and July 6. 1747.</NOTE> is that of David Edgar, tried for the murder of Wil|liam
Pai&s;ley, officer of exci&s;e. Edgar was one of a party
of &s;mugglers, who had fired at Pai&s;ley in the exerci&s;e of his
duty, and wounded him with &s;mall &s;hot or &s;lugs, in the leg
or knee. The man was attended by a &s;urgeon, the be&s;t
that could be had in the village whither he was carried,
and who was not alleged to have been deficient in atten|tion:
neverthele&s;s a great collection of matter having form|ed
in the leg, below the wound, and fever having en&s;ued;
at the end of three weeks the man died. Now this, it was
objected for the pannel, was not a relevant charge of mur|der:
In as much as the wound (it was &s;aid) was of that na|ture,
and in &s;uch a place, that with &s;kilful treatment it might
have been cured, and could not ju&s;tly be &s;uppo&s;ed to be the
cau&s;e of the per&s;on's death, e&s;pecially at &s;uch a di&s;tance
of time. It was an&s;wered, that the pannel might prove,
if he could, that death en&s;ued <HI>ex malo regimine,</HI> and not
from the nature of the wound; but that otherwi&s;e his plea
was naught, if the proof upon the pro&s;ecutor's part &s;hould
come up to the &s;howing of his libel. The Court found the
libel relevant to infer the pains of law. But the proof was
not conclu&s;ive again&s;t the pannel, as the per&s;on who in|flicted
the wound; and he had therefore a verdict in his
favour.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="330">
THIS ca&s;e gives occa&s;ion farther to remark, that though
death do not en&s;ue for weeks or months,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;e of Death at a Di&s;tance of Time;</NOTE> yet if the wound
be of it&s;elf &s;evere, and keep in a regular progre&s;&s;ion from
wor&s;e to wor&s;e, &s;o that the patient continually langui&s;hes
thereof, and is plainly con&s;umed by it as a di&s;ea&s;e; this
in rea&s;on, and in law, is all one as if he died upon the
&s;pot. A plea to the contrary was repelled in the ca&s;e of Ed|ward
and James Scrymgeour;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 27. 1618. and Jan. 15. 1619. July 30. 1630.</NOTE> where the decea&s;ed had been

he died in October. Again, in the ca&s;e of William Lowis,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 18. 1610.</NOTE>

for &s;eventeen months after the injury, the charge was

murder as well as robbery.<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">July 28. 1737. &startq;The Lords find, that the pannel having, time and place libelled, &s;eized the mail or packet coming from Gla&s;gow, or that he robbed the &s;ame, or robbed James John&s;ton the po&s;t-boy of all or any of the particulars re&s;pectively libelled, or that the pannel did give a mortal wound to the &s;aid James John&s;ton, whereof he afterwards died, or that the pannel was art and part of any of the fore&s;aid crimes, <HI>&s;eparatim,</HI> relevant to infer the pain of death and confi&s;cation of moveables.&endq;</NOTE>.

<HI>and brought ane &s;ymptomatical fever on her,</HI> which con|tinued
to the time of her death.&endq; The hard&s;hip in this
ca&s;e, and which in the end procured a pardon for the pannel,
was in the refu&s;al of the evidence offered on his part, to
&s;how that the fever was contracted at a di&s;tance of time, and
from another cau&s;e<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">I &s;hall here ob&s;erve, that though &s;uch has always been anciently the cour&s;e of judgment, yet nothing was more common in criminal pleadings than ar|guments of a very different complexion; in &s;o much, that I again and again find it objected to a libel, that it did not characteri&s;e the wound as <HI>mortal,</HI> although it related and &s;et forth that of this wound the decea&s;ed died. Thus, in William David&s;on's ca&s;e, (12th July 1726), the pannel argues, &startq;It is not enough to &s;ay that Hutchin&s;on <HI>died</HI> of the wound, for every wound after which death may, or even did follow, is not to be e&s;teemed a mortal wound.

In this the lawyers were taking advantage of the arrangements of books of &s;urgery; where wounds are found <HI>cla&s;&s;ed</HI> into &s;uch as are, or are not, mortal; and they endeavoured from thence to argue, that wherever a per&s;on died of a wound, not belonging to the mortal cla&s;s, it mu&s;t have been <HI>ex malo regimine,</HI> or through mi&s;conduct. We find, in like manner, that in the ca&s;e of Sir John Shaw, 20th February 1716, upon an indictment for a&s;&s;aulting and wounding, three phy&s;icians and two &s;urgeons &s;wear, that &startq;by the rules of their progno&s;tick,&endq; the wounds received by James Hou&s;ton were mortal.

<P>HOW right &s;oever the&s;e judgments upon the ca&s;es in which
they were given,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is there a limit|ed period in that article.</NOTE> it may however be alleged, that there
ought to be &s;ome rule of limitation in this matter, (&s;uch as
they are &s;aid to have in England to the &s;pace of a twelve-month)
grounded on the circum&s;tance of the period at
which the death takes place: Becau&s;e where the illne&s;s is
<PB N="274" REF="333">
of very long duration, it is difficult to trace the influ|ence
of the original injury, and its connection with the final
i&s;&s;ue, in that clear and palpable manner, which is to be
wi&s;hed in the inve&s;tigation of crimes. But with us, &s;o far
as I can learn, (nor have I ob&s;erved that this cour&s;e has
ever been attended with inju&s;tice), that circum&s;tance has
not been con&s;idered any otherwi&s;e than as one among
others, in the &s;um of evidence upon the ca&s;e. It is true,
that in the trial already mentioned of Patrick Kinninmonth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 22. 1697.</NOTE>
where certain injuries done to the per&s;on of Walter Ander|&s;on
are charged as the cau&s;e of his death, which took place
at the di&s;tance of more than fourteen months, the libel, as
to this article, is found only relevant to infer an arbitrary
pain. But this, as far as I can judge, was rather on account
of the nature of the injuries them&s;elves, which, as related in
the libel, are more of the de&s;cription of indignities, le&s;s in|tended
to injure, than to vilify and degrade.</P>

the womb. But in all the&s;e in&s;tances, another and a capital
crime concurred with the de&s;truction of the child; and it
cannot be known from the &s;hort and general expre&s;&s;ions of
the record, that the latter was found relevant as a murder by
it&s;elf: Neither have I found any in&s;tance of that de&s;cription
in later times. One ca&s;e is indeed &s;tated in &s;ome of the
Engli&s;h books, upon which there may be room for argument
again&s;t the pri&s;oner; the ca&s;e of a child which is born alive,
but dies immediately upon the birth, in con&s;equence of evil
medicines, which have previou&s;ly been admini&s;tered to the
mother<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hawkins, b. 1. c. 31. No. 16.</NOTE>. But it is difficult to imagine, (and no more needs
be &s;aid on the ca&s;e), that in the&s;e circum&s;tances a deci&s;ive
proof &s;hall ever be obtained of the true cau&s;e of the death
of the child.</P>
<P>HOWEVER this may be decided,<NOTE PLACE="marg">All one what the per&s;on kill|ed is.</NOTE> (if the occa&s;ion &s;hall ever
happen), it is certain that no di&s;tinction is taken in regard to
the creature killed, from any circum&s;tance which may be
thought to le&s;&s;en the value or importance of the life that has
been taken away. There is the &s;ame law for it, whether the
decea&s;ed was of found intellects or in&s;ane, a native &s;ubject or
an alien, a Chri&s;tian, a Jew, or an infidel, a true man or a
known criminal, one at peace with the church or an ex-communicated
per&s;on. With re&s;pect however to one cla&s;s
of per&s;ons, namely, per&s;ons who have been proclaimed re|bels,
(or denounced at the horn, as it is called), for criminal
cau&s;es, this has only become our law in later times. For it
appears, that according to the more &s;evere notions of our
<PB N="276" REF="335">
older juri&s;prudence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Slaughter of one at the Horn.</NOTE> no proce&s;s could be maintained for the
&s;laughter of a per&s;on in that condition; not by the King,
who had not lo&s;t a &s;ubject, or per&s;on at his peace and faith,
and as little by the relations of the decea&s;ed, who by &s;undry
&s;tatutes were forbidden to harbour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1540, c. 97. 1592, c. 146.</NOTE> comfort, or have inter|cour&s;e

&s;u&s;tained in the ca&s;e of Thomas Cran&s;toun of Mo|rie&s;toun,

&s;laughter of William Broomfield, who was at the horn for

It rather appears that the rea&s;ons of the practice were inde|pendent
of any &s;uch con&s;ideration; and indeed in that
trial other defences were far more &s;trenuou&s;ly urged, and
chiefly this, that the horning was already reduced and &s;et
a&s;ide by decree of the civil Court<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Be&s;ides, the King had directed two &s;everal warrants to the Court, ordering them to proceed in the trial without delay, and refu&s;ing, before hand, to receive the pannel into will, if he &s;hould make any tender to that effect.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NAY more,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Slaughter of one at the Horn for a civil cau&s;e.</NOTE> and which &s;erves to confirm the&s;e prece|dents,

and impri&s;oning of a free liege, defends him&s;elf on
this ground, that as &s;uch a one may lawfully be killed,
much more may he be impri&s;oned. It appears that this
preten&s;ion, which was not &s;o void of &s;upport in &s;pecious
arguments of law, as in rea&s;on and in &s;ub&s;tantial ju&s;tice,
<PB N="278" REF="337">
had given occa&s;ion to &s;ome alarm concerning the exten|&s;ive
con&s;equences into which &s;uch a doctrine would have
led: at lea&s;t this may be conjectured from a letter of the
King's, (recorded on the 24th April 1612), which ab&s;olves
the pannel from the pro&s;ecution, on condition that he re|nounce
his &s;aid defences, and con&s;ent to their being ex|punged
from the record; &startq;in&s;i&s;ting in the meane time ear|ne&s;tly,
that thou&s;e uthir exceptiones heretofoir u&s;it in his
defence being &s;o dangerous, and by no pre&s;edent warranded,
may not heiraftir be recordit in the regi&s;teris of adjournall
as lauchful or tolirable defences, to be proponit in the like
cai&s;s in ony tyme cuming.&endq; It was not however thought pro|per
to tru&s;t to this &s;ecurity: for truly the principle went alike
to both ca&s;es; the per&s;on being equally a rebel to the royal
will, whether he di&s;obeyed a civil or criminal proce&s;s. In the
&s;ame year a &s;tatute was therefore made,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1612, c. 3.</NOTE> which cut &s;hort this
controver&s;y, and declared, that in ca&s;es of &s;laughter or muti|lation
no &s;uch defence &s;hould be admitted. In the end, this
barbarous and extravagant doctrine was retrenched to the
due bounds, by the &s;tatute 1661, c. 22. which only permits
the &s;laughter of declared rebels for capital crimes, and only
when done in pur&s;uit of them to the ends of ju&s;tice, and up|on
their forcible oppo&s;ition. Indeed it would be a &s;trange
condition of the law, if a private and unauthori&s;ed indivi|dual
could with impunity, and on his private quarrel, kill a
per&s;on again&s;t whom there is no conviction on record, and
yet the magi&s;trate be guilty of murder, who varies from his
warrant in the execution of the &s;entence of death.</P>
<P>LAST of all,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Killing; the &s;e|veral ways of it.</NOTE> as to the way of killing; this general and
nece&s;&s;ary limitation mu&s;t be acknowledged, that the manner
of the death be &s;uch, wherein the act of the pannel plainly
<PB N="279" REF="338">
and palpably, and not by &s;u&s;picion and conjecture only, ap|pears.
It may be true, that in adhering to this rule, we &s;hall
leave unpuni&s;hed tho&s;e many modes of unkindne&s;s, ingrati|tude,
treachery, and oppre&s;&s;ion, by which, in too many ca&s;es,
the heart as well as health is broken, and the &s;ufferer con|ducted
to the grave, by a longer and more painful pa&s;&s;age.
But the rea&s;ons are obvious, why the&s;e tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, how
deep &s;oever, cannot be vindicated in the tribunals of this
world.</P>
<P>OTHER than this unavoidable re&s;triction, there &s;eems to be
none with re&s;pect to the way in which the per&s;on is de&s;troyed.
It is equally a homicide, whether the deed be done by the
very hand of the pannel, as in &s;hooting or &s;tabbing, or by
his expo&s;ing the decea&s;ed to the operation of &s;ome de&s;tructive
power; as by confining him to a dungeon without food, or by
&s;etting fire to the hou&s;e where he is a&s;leep, or by fa&s;tening
him to a rock in the &s;ea, and leaving him there, to be drown|ed
by the flood<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">This illu&s;tration was &s;ugge&s;ted by the narrative of the libel in the ca&s;e of Neil&s;on and others, (16th June 1620), which bears, that they bound the decea&s;ed hand and foot, and carried him in a boat &startq;to the Craig of Cla&s;&s;$e&s;&s;e, where ha|ving left him, the &s;ea overflowed the &s;aid Craig, and &s;o he was <HI>pitifully drown|ed and carried away to the main-ocean-&s;ea.</HI>&endq; This libel was not pro&s;ecuted to a trial.</NOTE>. Another illu&s;tration of this more indirect,
but not le&s;s cruel &s;ort of homicide, is in the ca&s;e of a new

night, in a &s;olitary place, and in rigorous weather, there to
be con&s;umed with cold and want of food;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Killing of In|fants by ex|polure.</NOTE> for this treatment
not only &s;hows an utter indifference about the fate of the

was found relevant in the ca&s;e of Helen Wil&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 16. 1722.</NOTE> who is &s;ta|ted

One can imagine other &s;ituations,
though not &s;o likely to happen, in which the &s;ame judgment
&s;hall be due. If a goaler &s;hall deliberately con&s;ine a pri&s;on|er

into a loth&s;ome and pe&s;tilential dungeon, where he &s;ickens,
and &s;hall refu&s;e to remove him thence, though he ob&s;erve the
dying condition of the man; all the&s;e acts are in law, equal|ly
as in con&s;cience, proper in&s;tances of the guilt of murder.
One &s;ituation more,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fal&s;e Evidence on a capital Trial.</NOTE> which may &s;eem to have a near affinity
to the&s;e, and which in the Roman practice was cla&s;&s;ed along
with them<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Dig. Lib. 48. tit. 8. t. 1. No. 1.</NOTE>, is that of the per&s;on who bears fal&s;e witne&s;s
in the trial of another for his life; if in con&s;equence the
accu&s;ed be condemned and &s;uffer death. That the guilt of
&s;uch a con&s;piracy is equal to that of murder, and truly far
exceeds the ordinary in&s;tances of it, in as much as it is an
act of deeper contrivance, and more deliberate and conti|nued
malice, will not admit of que&s;tion; and ca&s;es may
ea&s;ily be imagined where the dependence of the conviction
on the particular te&s;timony of the pannel &s;hall be &s;uffi|ciently
plain, to &s;et him down as the undoubted author of

this inference may be avoided, by u&s;ing the jury on the for|mer

di&s;tingui&s;hed in our practice by appropriated names.
There is one &s;ort of homicide, which is free of all blame,
and does not expo&s;e to any manner of pain. Another &s;ort
of homicide cannot indeed be capitally puni&s;hed, yet being
in &s;ome degree blameable, is &s;ubject to cen&s;ure, greater or
le&s;s, according to the mea&s;ure of the fault. The third &s;ort
of homicide is murder, and is puni&s;hed with death. In the
fourth divi&s;ion are compri&s;ed tho&s;e ca&s;es of aggravated mur|der,
<PB N="283" REF="342">
for which, to mark its abhorrence of them, the law
has appointed a more rigorous mode of execution, or &s;ome
indignity or farther injury, be&s;ide the lo&s;s of life.</P>
<P>FIRST, therefore, of the lowe&s;t degree of homicide, that
for which the killer is not liable to any &s;ort of pain. This
&s;ubdivides into two &s;pecies; being either <HI>ca&s;ual,</HI> that which
happens by pure mi&s;adventure, without any act of the kill|er's
will; or <HI>ju&s;tifiable,</HI> which is committed intentionally,
but may be vindicated upon principles of duty.</P>
<P>TO bring his ca&s;e within the de&s;cription of <HI>ca&s;ual</HI> homicide,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;ual Homi|cide; what it is.</NOTE>
it is not &s;ufficient for the pannel to &s;how, that he had no
fixed and ab&s;olute purpo&s;e to kill. For if he had a purpo&s;e
to do any great and outrageous bodily harm, &s;uch as might
i&s;&s;ue in death, and &s;howed an utter indifference about the
&s;afety of the &s;ufferer; this is not only not innocent, but it is
nothing le&s;s than murder. We &s;hall afterwards &s;ee, that the
books of adjournal contain many precedents to that effect.</P>
<P>FARTHER; where there is a wrongful purpo&s;e to do any
bodily harm, though not outrageous or exce&s;&s;ive, &s;till if
the event fall out unfortunately, &s;o that it kills, the invader is
not entirely innocent of the blood of the decea&s;ed; &s;ince he
is thus far blameable, that he did a thing which was wrong
and unlawful in it&s;elf, and which could i&s;&s;ue in the de&s;truction
of his neighbour. It is an example of this, if without pro|vocation
a per&s;on &s;trike a &s;ingle blow with the hand, and
it lights unluckily and kills; or if he violently jo&s;tle or
pu&s;h a per&s;on a&s;ide, whereby he &s;lips a foot, and breaks his
neck in the fall, or has his &s;kull fractured, and dies. We
&s;hall find, in &s;peaking of culpable homicide, that we have
al&s;o many precedents of puni&s;hment, more or le&s;s, inflicted
<PB N="284" REF="343">
in ca&s;es of this de&s;cription, according to the degree of the
wrong.</P>
<P>IN both the&s;e &s;ituations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;ual Homi|cide, Limitation of.</NOTE> there is a purpo&s;e of &s;ome
&s;ort of harm to the per&s;on who actually &s;uffers. But
the &s;ame holds equally good, if the homicide is done in
pro&s;ecution, generally, of any wrong and unlawful act,
though without malice to an individual. As if a per&s;on
fires a gun, loaded with powder only, in the &s;treets of a
town, and the gun bur&s;ts, and a pa&s;&s;enger is killed; or if a
piece of metal or other hard &s;ub&s;tance, has ignorantly and
accidentally been put into the gun in loading, and death
en&s;ues; for the firing of a gun in &s;uch a &s;ituation is ab&s;o|lately
wrong and unlawful. This la&s;t was the allegation
made in the ca&s;e of James Niven,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 21. 1795.</NOTE> who had killed by &s;iring
his piece, loaded (as he &s;aid accidentally) with a bit of iron,
in a &s;treet of common pa&s;&s;age, and at a time when &s;everal
per&s;ons were near him, and in &s;ight. The Court were una|nimou&s;ly
of opinion, that even upon his own &s;tate of the
ca&s;e, he would &s;till be guilty of culpable homicide. But
the jury acquitted him of the whole charge<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">This ca&s;e is erroneou&s;ly quoted in p. 6. as tried in March 1796. Notes of the opinions of the Judges in this ca&s;e are printed in the Appendix.</NOTE></P>
<P>LAST of all,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;ual Homi|cide, Limitation of.</NOTE> &s;ome puni&s;hment is due, though the &s;laughter
happen in the performance even of a lawful act, if there be
culpable heedle&s;&s;ne&s;s and indi&s;cretion, or a want of the due
caution and circum&s;pection, in the way of doing the thing.
As if a man leave his fowling-piece loaded, and afterwards
kill in trying the lock, having forgot the condition in which
he left it. Or if in driving any carriage through the &s;treets
<PB N="285" REF="344">
of a town, the driver quit his hor&s;es, and they run off with the
carriage, and a pa&s;&s;enger is killed. Or if workmen upon
a building by the &s;ide of a highway, throw down rubbi&s;h
without timely warning to the pa&s;&s;enger, that he may
avoid the danger. In all the&s;e ca&s;es, there is a want of
that attention, and due regard to the &s;afety of one's neigh|bour,
which ju&s;tly makes one an&s;werable for the con&s;equen|ces,
and puni&s;hable to that extent which may &s;erve to cor|rect
&s;o faulty a habit of mind, either in one's &s;elf or in
others. Hereunto mu&s;t be referred that judgment of rele|vancy,
as for culpable homicide, which was given at Stir|ling
in April 1789, in the ca&s;e of one Hender&s;on, who being at
a wedding, and having fired a pi&s;tol by the &s;ide of the high|way,
to &s;alute the couple as they pa&s;&s;ed, happened to kill
one of the party with the wadding only. The thing it|&s;elf
could hardly be &s;aid to be unlawful, being u&s;ual on
&s;uch occa&s;ions; but the pannel was blameable in having fired

<P>THIS may farther be illu&s;trated by one &s;ituation more,

admini&s;ters powerful and improper drugs, or in exce&s;&s;ive and

find a ca&s;e &s;o circum&s;tanced, as to be open to the application
of &s;uch a cen&s;ure. Yet it cannot be denied, that there is a
high wrong, and criminal indi&s;cretion in the conduct of &s;uch
a one, who knowingly puts his neighbour to hazard, though
in &s;ome mea&s;ure with his own con&s;ent, by the u&s;e of &s;uch

<P>1. THIS is the &s;ituation of the Judge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;e of Judge giving Doom to die.</NOTE> who pronounces the
&s;entence of the law on the malefactor, in pur&s;uance of his

who officiate in either of the&s;e capacities, have no
choice nor will upon the matter, but are the mere organs
of the law, who&s;e command they are nece&s;&s;itated to obey.
To enjoy the full benefit of this indemnity, the Judge mu&s;t
however be &s;uch, who&s;e office gives him cognizance of the
offence which he has tried; and he mu&s;t have proceeded in
the exerci&s;e of his powers, according to the known rules
of law, and the &s;ettled order of his Court. A Sheriff, there|fore,
who &s;hould condemn to death for rape or fire-rai&s;ing;
or any inferior judge who &s;hould pre&s;ume to hold proce&s;s
for trea&s;on; or any judge who &s;hould try for witchcraft, or
&s;hould try for any capital offence without a jury; would, in
ca&s;e of execution of his &s;entence, (if &s;uch a thing could
happen), be guilty of a murder, &s;o much the more blame|able
only as proceeding under colour and form of law.

and in the belief of their re&s;pective powers, is a plea,
(how available &s;oever in matters of patrimonial damage),
<PB N="289" REF="348">
which though it &s;hould even be true, the law cannot coun|tenance
or pay regard to. The mi&s;take was gro&s;s and pal|pable;
the occa&s;ion called for the highe&s;t circum&s;pec|tion;
and he &s;hall therefore be judged as if he had witting|ly
and maliciou&s;ly compa&s;&s;ed the death of the per&s;on who
has fallen a victim to his ignorance or precipitation. With
all this, it is not however to be under&s;tood, that every error
of the judge with re&s;pect to the extent, or even the &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ance
of his commi&s;&s;ion, is equally inexcu&s;able, and puts him
in the &s;ame hazard of his life. But with re&s;pect to &s;itua|tions
of this character, which mu&s;t always be rare, and
the preci&s;e bounds of the allowance which the law will
or ought to have of &s;uch irregularities; I &s;hall not un|dertake
the arduous ta&s;k of conducting the reader through
&s;o difficult, and hitherto unexplored a path, or of &s;upplying
from my own lights, the defect of our records, which fur|ni&s;h
no materials towards the deci&s;ion of controver&s;ies of
&s;o delicate a kind.</P>
<P>WHAT is true of the magi&s;trate in the ordinary ca&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;e of Officers executing capi|tal Sentence.</NOTE>
is no le&s;s &s;o of the officer employed to execute the &s;entence;
who, to have the protection of the law, mu&s;t be the proper
officer, to whom the execution of that &s;entence belongs, and
has been committed. A mob, for in&s;tance, who break into
the goal, and carry forth the capital convict and put him
to death, are guilty of no lower crime than murder; though
to &s;ave appearances, (but which only &s;erves to make the
abu&s;e the more remarkable) they proceed in this &s;cheme of
vengeance on the very day, and in the manner mentioned
in the doom. For in their hands it is not at all an execu|tion
of &s;entence, but an act of malicious and outrageous
<PB N="290" REF="349">
revenge on the individual, as well as an open contempt of
the magi&s;trate, and of the e&s;tabli&s;hed order of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>FARTHER,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;e of Sen|tence executed by a wrong Per|&s;on.</NOTE> and which is not &s;o &s;trong a ca&s;e: If the warrant
of execution is addre&s;&s;ed to the magi&s;trates of a burgh, and
they decline to execute the duty; how wrong and how pre|judicial
&s;oever &s;uch conduct on their part, &s;till no private per|&s;on,
nor even any other magi&s;trate of that place or neigh|bourhood,
&s;uch as a Ju&s;tice of the Peace, or the Sheriff of
the county, can without his own peril interpo&s;e, to take the
duty of execution on him&s;elf. Nay, it may even be main|tained
to fall within the &s;ame rule, though the &s;entence be
executed at the proper time and place, and by the ordinary
magi&s;trate to whom in common cour&s;e the <HI>dead warrant</HI> falls
to be directed; if he proceed therein on &s;ight only of the
books of adjournal, or on report of the clerk of Court, or on
common &s;ame and notoriety, without &s;uch warrant actually
made out and delivered to him. For this is a duty of that
nature, which to be ju&s;tified in performing, a per&s;on mu&s;t
be nece&s;&s;itated to undertake; &s;o that he &s;hall not be held
free of malice, if he is forward to offer him&s;elf to it, or
&s;tep out of the ordinary cour&s;e of form and bu&s;ine&s;s, to
intermeddle with or enquire about it. Somewhat a-kin to
this, and to be judged in the &s;ame manner, is the ca&s;e of a
magi&s;trate, who proceeds of his own knowledge, and without
a new warrant from the proper Court, to execute a convict
who has e&s;caped from goal, and is not recovered till after
the day appointed for his execution; though certainly if
the magi&s;trate appear to have acted con&s;cientiou&s;ly, and in
the thorough belief of his powers, his ca&s;e may be a proper
object of the interpo&s;ition of the royal mercy.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="350">
IN conducting the execution, the magi&s;trate is in like
manner to be guided by the terms of the &s;entence, and war|rant
in pur&s;uance thereof to him addre&s;&s;ed. That is to &s;ay,
any material and unnece&s;&s;ary variation from the warrant
&s;hall bring the ca&s;e to be the &s;ame, as if the &s;ufferer had not
been under &s;entence of death. Thus if the magi&s;trate &s;hall
burn a convict, who&s;e &s;entence is to be hanged upon a gib|bet;
or, in&s;tead of a public execution, if he have him &s;trang|led
privately in goal; or if he negligently let the day of
execution pa&s;s, and think to make amends by executing the
convict on &s;ome later day; it &s;eems clearly to be &s;uch a ho|micide,
for which the offender &s;hall be an&s;werable with his
own life: &s;eeing in all the&s;e in&s;tances there is a wilful va|riation
in matters which are conditions of the &s;entence,
and that his conduct herein &s;hows a degree of <HI>malus animus,</HI>
or criminal contempt and di&s;regard, more or le&s;s, with re|&s;pect
to the unfortunate object of his unwarrantable pro|ceedings.</P>
<P>IT is no le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to remark on the other &s;ide,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Execution vary|ing from the Warrant.</NOTE> that this
rigour is only &s;uitable to the ordinary ca&s;e; where, if atten|tive,
and in the due di&s;po&s;ition of mind, the magi&s;trate has it
in his power to proceed according to the letter of his war|rant.
Where this is not &s;o, and the obstacle is owing to the
fault of others, not to that of the magi&s;trate him&s;elf, it were
again&s;t all rea&s;on to judge him by the &s;ame rules. Thus
our &s;entence of death, by ordinary &s;tyle, directs the convict
to be hanged upon <HI>a gibbet</HI> by the hands of the <HI>common execu|tioner,</HI>
between the hours <HI>of two and four.</HI> But if the com|mon
executioner &s;hall die, or run away, or refu&s;e the duty
when the day comes, and if the magi&s;trate &s;hall carry the
&s;entence into effect by the hands of any other per&s;on, or
<PB N="292" REF="351">
even by his own hands, if he can find no one to undertake
the office, is it to be thought that he is therefore guilty of
murder; or is he not rather commendable for thus hinder|ing
the &s;entence of the law to be di&s;appointed, which if delay|ed
to be fulfilled for &s;o trivial a rea&s;on, could not afterwards
be at all put in execution? Or if a mob ri&s;e and pull down
the gibbet, and the judgment &s;hall in con&s;equence be car|ried
into effect upon a tree, &s;ign-po&s;t, or the like, as nigh as
can be found to the ordinary place of execution, and with
as near regard as the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e allow to the
terms of the &s;entence; or if the multitude &s;hall re&s;cue the
criminal, and keep him for a time in their own hands, &s;o
that the preci&s;e hour has pa&s;&s;ed before the la&s;t &s;tep of exe|cution;
it &s;eems that either this is no crime at all, (being
done under the firm impre&s;&s;ion of right and duty), or at the
wor&s;t it is a mi&s;demeanour or irregularity, of a nature quite
remote from the crime of homicide, and to which &s;ome
very moderate cen&s;ure only can be applied.</P>
<P>2. NEXT in degree to the&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide in Suppre&s;&s;ion of a Riot.</NOTE> which are of the highe&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of any, is the ca&s;e of that homicide which is com|mitted
by a magi&s;trate, or on his order, in &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of
a riotous a&s;&s;embly. Now, with re&s;pect to this matter, which
&s;hall be con&s;idered more at large under the head of riot, it
is in this place only nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that to maintain
the King's peace, and di&s;per&s;e tumultuous convocations, and
arre&s;t the delinquents, is an undoubted and important part of
the duty of every magi&s;trate within his bounds; and &s;uch,
which if any one &s;hall altogether decline, or be &s;lack and
&s;low to perform, he &s;hall not &s;tand acquitted of the public
tru&s;t which is repo&s;ed in him. If, therefore, in his lawful
and laudable exertions towards this end, he &s;hall be oppo&s;ed
<PB N="293" REF="352">
or re&s;i&s;ted by the offenders, who will not de&s;i&s;t, nor di&s;per&s;e,
nor &s;uffer them&s;elves to be apprehended, but make head
again&s;t the magi&s;trate and his <HI>po&s;&s;e,</HI> and violently mole&s;t
and hinder him therein, certainly he may make good his
purpo&s;e by force, and at the hazard of their lives; &s;o he do
not employ &s;uch means unnece&s;&s;arily, nor before the proper
&s;ea&s;on. This is the clear doctrine of the common law,
founded in rea&s;on and nece&s;&s;ity, and without which the ends
of government cannot be an&s;wered, and to which, accord|ing
to all authorities<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Hale, vol. 1. p. 53. 293. 495.; Hawkins, vol. 1. c. 28. No. 14. c. 65. No. 11.; Fo&s;ter, p. 270. No. 2.; Black&s;tone, b. 4. c. 14. p. 179 180.</NOTE>, the declaration of the riot-act makes
no addition;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1&s;t Geo. I. c. 5.</NOTE> farther than as it rai&s;es the bare continuance
of the riotous a&s;&s;embly for a certain &s;pace into a capital fe|lony,
and thus determines a particular &s;ea&s;on, after which
the rioters are more inexcu&s;able, and the magi&s;trate &s;hall be
more to blame, if he &s;uffer the di&s;order to continue. In
like manner, though the time limited in that &s;tatute be not
expired, or though proclamation have not been made as
there directed; yet if the multitude proceed to outrageous
acts of violence again&s;t property or per&s;on, here al&s;o is the
magi&s;trate not only entitled, but obliged to interpo&s;e in aid
and protection of the individual, and to repel this unlawful
force with force, without con&s;ideration of the con&s;equence
to the invaders. For this too was always the common law,
and can never be con&s;trued to be taken away by tho&s;e new
provi&s;ions which have been made for the more effectual &s;up|pre&s;&s;ion
of tumults, and in enlargement of the ordinary
powers of the magi&s;trate. The incidents of this &s;ort which
have happened in Scotland, have been attended with &s;uch
deci&s;ive circum&s;tances in favour of the magi&s;trate, as has

or their a&s;&s;i&s;tants, who are employed in the &s;earching
for and taking, conveying, or &s;ure-keeping of per&s;ons char|ged
with crimes. Upon this important article the doctrine
of the law of England, &s;eems by the concurrence of all au|thorities
to be &s;ettled thus: That the felon who re&s;i&s;ts the
officers of ju&s;tice having warrant, or called by hue and
cry again&s;t him by name, to hinder their taking him, or who
being taken a&s;&s;aults them, or the goaler who keeps him, to
make his e&s;cape, may lawfully be killed; nay that the &s;ame
is even true of the felon who flies from execution of the
criminal proce&s;s, if he cannot be taken alive. This too &s;hall
equally be the rule, though the per&s;on again&s;t whom the
warrant is, &s;hould truly be an innocent man; for he ought
to yield him&s;elf to the ju&s;tice of his country, and an&s;wer
to the charge that is on record again&s;t him. Nor do I find
that in this matter any di&s;tinction is taken from the &s;ort of
weapon, mortal or not mortal, with which the re&s;i&s;tance or
a&s;&s;ault is made; but only the ju&s;t and &s;alutary caution is
added, that the &s;laughter be nece&s;&s;ary to the taking or re|covering
of the per&s;on. In judging however of this nece&s;|&s;ity,
it is not to be under&s;tood that the officer of ju&s;tice,
like a private man, is obliged to give back on the a&s;&s;ault
or re&s;i&s;tance: on the contrary, his commi&s;&s;ion ju&s;tifies him
in continually pre&s;&s;ing forward to his object<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hale, vol. i. p. 481. 490.; Fo&s;ter, p. 270, 271, 272, 318.; Hawkins, p. 70, 71.; Black&s;t. b. 4. c. 14. No. 2.</NOTE>.</P>

and to exalt the authority of the law, as well as to protect
the per&s;ons of its mini&s;ters, and to in&s;ure the cour&s;e of cri|minal
ju&s;tice. But that the practice of Scotland &s;hall in all

that it &s;hall make the &s;ame allowance in the ca&s;e of
the felon barely flying from the warrant that is out again&s;t
him; or in general, that our law has in this article attained
to the &s;ame maturity as that of England, cannot perhaps,
upon the &s;tate of our records, be affirmed. Such precedents as
they afford, are however, upon that &s;ide of the que&s;tion.
One is the ca&s;e of John Gille&s;pie and others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 24. 1694.</NOTE> who were in|dicted
for the murder of Major Menzies. The pannels were
private per&s;ons, di&s;patched on a verbal order of the magi&s;|trates
of Gla&s;gow, in pur&s;uit of Menzies, who a few hours
before had committed a murder, and had fled. Having
found him, they fired at and killed him, on his refu&s;al to
&s;urrender, and preparation to re&s;i&s;t them with a drawn &s;word
in his hand; but before he had made a pa&s;s or thru&s;t at
any of the party.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maclaurin, No. 8.</NOTE> The Court found the defence relevant;

<P>IN this in&s;tance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide on Re&s;i&s;tance of criminal War|rant.</NOTE> the re&s;i&s;tance was with a mortal weapon,
and by a per&s;on who was charged with a capital offence.
But it is &s;carcely to be thought that there is room for any
&s;ettled di&s;tinction in law, to be taken from the&s;e, the aggra|vating
circum&s;tances of the &s;ituation. That which in any
ca&s;e of re&s;i&s;tance to a criminal warrant ju&s;tifies the homi|cide,
is the attempt, with probable &s;ucce&s;s, to di&s;appoint the
cour&s;e of public ju&s;tice, and the contemptuous defiance of
the powers of the &s;tate in this high and intere&s;ting part of
<PB N="296" REF="355">
public order. The nece&s;&s;ity which the officer hath lain un|der
to kill, is therefore, in every in&s;tance, to be judged of on
the whole circum&s;tances of the &s;ituation; and to allow his
privilege in regard only to criminals of the highe&s;t degree,
would be a pernicious, and indeed impracticable di&s;tinction,
which would vilify, as well the law and the magi&s;trate, as
the per&s;on and commi&s;&s;ion of the officer, with the very per|&s;ons
whom they are employed to overawe.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;e of Samuel Burch, tried in July 1748, &s;eems here
to be in point. This man was a &s;ergeant in the recruiting
&s;ervice at Lanark. Where, happening to have a quarrel
with one Ramage, an inhabitant of the place, the matter
was carried before the magi&s;trate of the burgh, who found
Ramage in the wrong, and partly for that rea&s;on, but more
on account of contempt of him&s;elf in the cour&s;e of the en|quiry,
gave warrant to commit him. A multitude a&s;&s;embled
to re&s;cue Ramage; and Burch with his party, was ordered to
a&s;&s;i&s;t in conveying him to gaol. In the cour&s;e of carrying
him thither, and upon the &s;teps in front of the goal, the par|ty
were a&s;&s;aulted. Numbers of people pre&s;&s;ed upon them,
and the &s;oldiers were &s;truck with &s;taves by Ramage as
well as others; &s;tones al&s;o were thrown at them, and at
length, a drummer was pulled down the &s;teps by the hair,
to the ground; whereupon Burch drew his &s;word, and
by threats and feigned pa&s;&s;es, di&s;engaged his party for a
time. The attack was, however, renewed in the &s;ame fa|&s;hion;
&s;ome of the a&s;&s;ailants, who had got higher upon the
&s;teps pu&s;hing him down, while others, who were below,
pre&s;&s;ed him the other way. In this &s;ituation, after &s;triking
certain of them with the flat of his &s;word, he at length made
a thru&s;t at one Aitken and killed him. This was the amount
of the proof: upon which the jury found it proved, that
<PB N="297" REF="356">
what he did &startq;was in &s;elf-defence, and in the execution of
his office.&endq; The &s;trength of his plea lay, however, in the
circum&s;tance of duty. For otherwi&s;e the danger of his per|&s;on
was hardly to be reckoned of that imminent and pre&s;|&s;ing
kind, which would have made a ca&s;e of pure &s;elf-de|fence
to an individual,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maclaurin, No. 54.</NOTE> invaded in his ordinary bu&s;ine&s;s.
The pannel was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the bar.</P>
<P>THIS high privilege of the officer and his party,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What if the cri|minal Warrant be wrong.</NOTE> who are
employed in the taking or conveying of a criminal, is al|ways
to be received under the provi&s;ion that he is bearer of
a lawful warrant; granted by one who has cogni&s;ance of
that matter, allowable to be i&s;&s;ued on that occa&s;ion, and
proceeded with by the officer and his party in due and
rea&s;onable manner. In any of which points, if there be
a plain and gro&s;s irregularity; as if the warrant is not
&s;igned, or is &s;igned by one who is not a magi&s;trate for that
di&s;trict, or does not bear the offender's name, or if the
officer has it not upon him at the time, or goes out of his
bounds to execute it, or lays hold of a wrong per&s;on, or
breaks up the door of a hou&s;e in the night without demand
of entry, or notice given of the warrant: In all the&s;e ca&s;es,
being no longer within the rule of his duty, he forfeits the
privilege of his office in this particular, and cannot be
fully <HI>ju&s;tified</HI> for any &s;laughter which en&s;ues. Though,
whether in every ca&s;e of this de&s;cription his guilt &s;hall
amount to murder, or &s;ometimes only to &s;ome lower &s;ort of
homicide, is a &s;eparate and more difficult que&s;tion; of
which in its proper place.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems however to be the more rea&s;onable &s;entiment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What if the Warrant be wrong.</NOTE>
that the officer &s;hall lo&s;e his privilege in the ca&s;e only of
<PB N="298" REF="357">
&s;uch vices, which are in the immediate frame and texture
of the warrant; and that he is not affected by tho&s;e more
remote and extrin&s;ic, and to him unknown and un&s;earchable
irregularities, which have happened in the way of applying
for the warrant, or in the proceedings which have been the
grounds of obtaining it. A &s;heriff-officer kills upon re|&s;i&s;tance
by a criminal, again&s;t whom there is an Engli&s;h
warrant, which the Sheriff has indor&s;ed, in compliance with
the &s;tatute in that behalf. It is afterwards found, that the
fir&s;t warrant was not obtained in the due cour&s;e of the law
of England. Neverthele&s;s, the Sheriff and his officer &s;hall
have a clear defence, being neither of them bound to know,
nor entitled to enquire concerning the forms of i&s;&s;uing an
Engli&s;h warrant; but the one nece&s;&s;itated to obey the com|mand
of his &s;uperior, as the other is to comply with the re|qui&s;ition
of the law, upon proof made to him of the verity
of the warrant, after the manner appointed by the &s;tatute.
Or put the ca&s;e, that the magi&s;trate is impo&s;ed on by calum|nious
information, or, which is more unfavourable, that
without any proper charge or information lodged with him,
he on his own &s;u&s;picion, ra&s;hly, or even maliciou&s;ly, i&s;&s;ues
warrant again&s;t &s;uch a one by name, as accu&s;ed of a high
crime. This will not hinder the killing of him to be law|ful,
if he violently re&s;i&s;t; for the officer can do no other
than obey the order of the magi&s;trate; and it is therefore
the duty of the party to &s;ubmit to him therein, and &s;eek his
remedy in cour&s;e of law.</P>
<P>ON all occa&s;ions where the officer would be ju&s;tified in
killing the felon him&s;elf on his re&s;i&s;tance, he &s;hall equally
be ju&s;tified in killing tho&s;e, (as in the ca&s;e of Burch), who
wilfully take part with the criminal, and by force ob&s;truct
and &s;tay him in his pur&s;uit. And what is true of the mini|&s;ters
<PB N="299" REF="358">
of the law them&s;elves, &s;eems to be no le&s;s &s;o of their
concurrents, lawfully commanded to a&s;&s;i&s;t them; &s;o they
may be known for &s;uch to the party re&s;i&s;ting, and are not
chargeable with any precipitation or exce&s;s in their pro|ceedings.</P>
<P>4. TOUCHING the ca&s;e of proce&s;s or diligence of a civil
nature;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide on re|&s;i&s;tance of civil Proce&s;s.</NOTE> there are plain and &s;ufficient rea&s;ons why the officer
&s;hould not be allowed &s;o broad a privilege, as for the execu|tion
of criminal warrants, wherein not only is the public in|tere&s;t
concerned, but the party is under higher temptation to
withdraw him&s;elf from the law. In England therefore,
the rule with regard to any pure civil proce&s;s, or proce&s;s
on account of tre&s;pa&s;s is, that the party cannot be killed in
flying from it, but on his re&s;i&s;tance of it only<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hawkins, b. 1. c. 28. No. 17. 20. Fo&s;ter, p. 271. No. 3. Hale, vol. i. p. 481.</NOTE>. The
doubt with us will not be, whether to go farther for pro|tection
of the officer, but whether we will go &s;o far, and hold
a me&s;&s;enger to be ju&s;tifiable for &s;uch &s;laughter, as he nece&s;|&s;arily
doth towards the execution of a poinding, caption,
or other civil diligence to apprehend. The following &s;eem
to be the chief precedents upon this matter, though perhaps
neither &s;o numerous, nor &s;o conclu&s;ive, as might be wi&s;hed
in &s;o intere&s;ting an article of the law.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t is the ca&s;e of James Gordon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide on re|&s;i&s;tance of civil Proce&s;s.</NOTE> me&s;&s;enger, and

captions again&s;t him, one of which appears to have been
a caption of lawborrows. Their defence was twofold.
1<HI>&s;t,</HI> The danger of their lives; having been invaded with
<PB N="300" REF="359">
mortal weapons, fired upon, and pur&s;ued from place to
place under night by a ho&s;t of people. 2<HI>dly,</HI> Execution of
their duty<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>The pannel maintains his defence of deforcement to be good, &startq;becau&s;e the pannel coming to execute a caption, he was authori&s;ed by their Maje&s;ties au|thority, and being attacked in the execution, was thereby warranted to keep his po&s;t and defend again&s;t aggre&s;&s;ors; and his being &s;o warranted, did allow to him and his party a greater latitude of defence, e&s;pecially when aggre&s;&s;ed un|der cloud of night by armed men, who actually fir&s;t &s;hot, than if he had been fir&s;t &s;tated in the ca&s;e of preci&s;e &s;elf-defence, <HI>tanquam quilibet.</HI> And to al|lege that the me&s;&s;enger finding oppo&s;ition or re&s;i&s;tance at the hou&s;e, &s;hould only have broke his wand, and prote&s;ted, and then might have in&s;i&s;ted for his deforcement, as a di&s;tinct crime puni&s;hable by confi&s;cation, it is <HI>gratis dictum;</HI> and the me&s;&s;enger was <HI>in optima fide</HI> to &s;tay and wait his time for making open doors, conform to the warrant of the letters.&endq;</P>

And therefore, although they had been deforced, which is po&s;itively denied; yet all that in law could have been done is, that the me&s;&s;enger &s;hould have broke his wand of peace, and prote&s;ted for remeid of law; and therefore deforcement is noways relevant, unle&s;s that the me&s;&s;enger and his a&s;&s;i&s;tants had been <HI>in periculo vitae,</HI> and could not otherwi&s;e have e&s;caped.&endq;</P></NOTE>; which la&s;t was &s;u&s;tained in the&s;e terms: &startq;Su|&s;tain

<P>IN the &s;ame year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide on re|&s;i&s;tance of civil Proce&s;s.</NOTE> William Fife, me&s;&s;enger in Pai&s;ley, and
his a&s;&s;i&s;tants, were indicted for the murder of Andrew Wil|&s;on,
an infirm old man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 29. &amp; 30. 1691.</NOTE> who had come forth in order to
re&s;cue his &s;on-in-law, one Peoch, their pri&s;oner, taken upon
caption<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>In one place he pleads, &startq;That however the remedy mentioned in our &s;ta|tutes, of breaking the wand of peace, may have been thought &s;uitable by the Legi&s;lature to that kind of deforcement that is carried on without invading the me&s;&s;enger with weapons offen&s;ive; yet it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that the meaning of the law would be beyond the expre&s;&s;ion of it, to preclude the Go|vernment and its mini&s;ters from the benefit of tho&s;e remedies, which by the principles and practiques of all laws and nations of the world, is competent upon a violent invading of authority in the per&s;on of the me&s;&s;enger, who, as executor of the law, is the life of it.&endq;</P>
<P>In another place thus: &startq;That the authority of the Government being the only thing in danger by &s;uch an attack upon a me&s;&s;enger, the law warrants his re&s;i&s;ting &s;uch oppo&s;ition in manner alleged for him, albeit his own per&s;on were in no danger, otherways the power that the me&s;&s;enger is entru&s;ted with would put him in no &s;pecial ca&s;e from the re&s;t of the lieges; to whom, <HI>de jure com|muni,</HI> the allegeance of &s;elf-defence is always competent, albeit they have nei|ther Government nor authority to protect them.&endq;</P></NOTE>. This interlocutor was given on the defence and
reply: &startq;As al&s;o, finds the defence, that William Fife,
me&s;&s;enger, and the other two pannels, his a&s;&s;i&s;tants, had
<PB N="302" REF="361">
Peoch their pri&s;oner, by an execute caption, and that the
defunct did by violence offer to re&s;cue him, and did ac|tually
draw a daiger upon William Fife, the pannel, in|vading
him therewith, relevant to elide the libel <HI>&s;impli|citer.</HI>&endq;
It was found relevant to elide this defence, that
the me&s;&s;enger killed the decea&s;ed at a time when he was
re&s;cuing his &s;on-in-law from a ma&s;tiff, which had thrown
him to the ground. It appeared in evidence, that Fife had
&s;everely wounded Wil&s;on with a &s;word, on his fir&s;t coming
to the &s;pot and &s;howing a di&s;po&s;ition to re&s;i&s;t, and before
his drawing of the dagger. His defence was found not
proved, and he had &s;entence of death.</P>
<P>THE next ca&s;e is that of Simp&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide on re|&s;i&s;tance of civil Proce&s;s.</NOTE> and others, tried in July
1757; which had a more fortunate i&s;&s;ue for the pannels.
The matter which gave occa&s;ion to the &s;laughter, was a
warrant i&s;&s;ued by the Ju&s;tices of the Peace for Ea&s;t Lothian,
to apprehend and bring before them one George Wood, a
loo&s;e fellow, and a notorious poacher, with a view to his
being &s;ent off as a &s;oldier, under authority of a &s;tatute
of the time. The man was known to be of a hardy and
de&s;perate nature, and the con&s;table took a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ol|diers
to his hou&s;e. Where, when they had arrived, and had
notified their errand to him, po&s;ted as they were upon the
&s;teps and thre&s;hold, he an&s;wered by di&s;charging a fowling-piece,
loaded with ball, through the door. The &s;oldiers
now loaded their pieces at the con&s;table's command, and
&s;tanding a&s;ide from the door and the &s;teps, they fired
into the hou&s;e; one of which &s;hots taking an oblique di|rection,
killed the man, &s;tanding in his &s;hirt, upon the
hearth, in his own apartment. The pannels farther prov|ed,
that Wood had formed the re&s;olution not to be ta|ken
<PB N="303" REF="362">
alive, and kept &s;everal pieces ready loaded in the hou&s;e.
There was no &s;pecial interlocutor of the Court upon the de|fence,
(for before this time the practice had cea&s;ed of pro|nouncing
any &s;uch); but the jury thought favourably of the
ca&s;e, and found a verdict for the pannels.</P>
<P>A SPECIAL relevancy had been found in a former, and
very &s;imilar ca&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 18. &amp; 19. 1711.</NOTE> that of the Ma&s;ter of Elphin&s;ton; where
the party re&s;i&s;ter did indeed &s;urvive the injury, but received
three wounds with a &s;word, of which he lingered for a time,
in great danger of his life. The Ma&s;ter of Elphin&s;ton was
an officer in the &s;ervice of the King, and had accompanied
a con&s;table to the hou&s;e of one Dick, to take him on a war|rant
from the Ju&s;tices, as a proper per&s;on to be comprehend|ed
under the &s;tatute, for a &s;oldier. The per&s;ons within re|fu&s;ed
admittance, and fired on the party from the hou&s;e;
whereupon the party broke in, and Dick was &s;everely wound|ed.
&startq;The Lords find the libel again&s;t the Ma&s;ter of El|phin&s;ton
as libelled, relevant to infer an arbitrary puni&s;h|ment;
and &s;u&s;tained the defence proponed for the Ma&s;ter,
that what he did was in a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the con&s;table, to be
aiding to him at that time in execution of his office, com|mitted
to him by the act 7<HI>mo Annae,</HI> anent recruiting his
Maje&s;ty's forces, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or <HI>&s;eparatim,</HI> that what he did was
in &s;elf-defence, relevant to elide the libel, and repelled
the other defences and replies.&endq; The jury found the li|bel
not proved, and the pannel was a&s;&s;oilzied.</P>
<P>NOW it is to be ob&s;erved of all the&s;e ca&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide on re|&s;i&s;tance of civil Proce&s;s.</NOTE> that it is &s;ome|thing
more ample than the common plea of &s;elf-defence,
that is &s;u&s;tained to ab&s;olve the pannels; neither does any of
the interlocutors make u&s;e of that term, nor require the <HI>peri|culum
vilae</HI> to exculpate. To have the benefit of &s;elf-defence,
<PB N="304" REF="363">
the pannel mu&s;t be able to &s;ay that he has retired from the
invader, and avoided the a&s;&s;ault, as far as with &s;afety to
him&s;elf he could; and that it was only out of nece&s;&s;ity he
killed, when he was otherwi&s;e in imminent and in&s;tant dan|ger
of his life. Now in no one of the&s;e ca&s;es is it alleged
for the pannel that he at all yielded or gave back; and in any
one of them, and more e&s;pecially in the two la&s;t, where a
locked door was between the ho&s;tile parties, he might at once
have put his per&s;on in &s;ecurity, by abandoning the object of
his warrant, on the threats and preparation of re&s;i&s;tance.
It is indeed evident, that to apply the common rule of &s;elf-defence
in this department, and confine the officers of the
law to the &s;ame narrow path as ordinary men, would put
them in continual hazard of ob&s;truction and deforcement,
to the utter ruin of their authority and that of the law;
till at la&s;t, (as I find it expre&s;&s;ed in an old pleading<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Ca&s;e of Mackinto&s;h in 1673.</NOTE>),
&startq;every man's &s;word would become his own &s;u&s;pen&s;ion,
and the di&s;charge of his debt.&endq; Even the firing at the
officer, or an a&s;&s;ault on him with mortal weapons, could not,
upon that principle, ju&s;tify him in the u&s;e of the like force,
or in advancing to pro&s;ecute his purpo&s;e: For by the con|&s;ent
of all authorities, any &s;uch forward movement is &s;ub|ver&s;ive
of the pure plea of &s;elf-defence. But an officer of
the law, bearing the lawful warrant of a magi&s;trate, has
other con&s;iderations to attend to before the &s;afety of the
per&s;on who wrongfully oppo&s;es him; other duties to fulfil be|&s;ide
tho&s;e of mere humanity; and mu&s;t therefore have the
benefit of quite a different pre&s;umption in his favour. If
the party fly, he mu&s;t follow; if he re&s;i&s;t, far from yielding,
he mu&s;t &s;tand to and maintain his &s;ervice; and in doing
<PB N="305" REF="364">
otherwi&s;e, he is guilty of a mi&s;demeanour, tending to weak|en
the authority of the law, and unhinge the order of the
State. If, therefore, he be reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of ei|ther
killing the re&s;i&s;ter or abandoning his warrant, the law
cannot in ju&s;tice refu&s;e to hold it for a &s;laughter done from
con&s;traint of his duty, and in nowi&s;e out of malice or re|&s;entment.
Nor does it weigh again&s;t this view of the &s;i|tuation,
that, in all in&s;tances of per&s;onal diligence, the
&s;laughter, in&s;tead of fulfilling, defeats the object of the war|rant.
For that which the Judge chiefly con&s;iders in the&s;e
que&s;tions, is not &s;o much the carrying of the particular war|rant
into effect, as the vindicating of the authority of law,
and of the magi&s;trate, which would otherwi&s;e fall into con|tempt.
And herein, as I conceive, lies one rea&s;on why, in
England, the per&s;on who flies from execution of a civil pro|ce&s;s
cannot be killed, though he who re&s;i&s;ts it lawfully may.
His flight may be the mo&s;t effectual di&s;appointment of the
warrant, even more &s;o than his re&s;i&s;tance: But in flying he
does not di&s;pute, he rather yields to and acknowledges, the
authority of the mandate which is &s;ent again&s;t him.</P>
<P>THE rule &s;eems therefore to be,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide on Re&s;i&s;tance of civil Proce&s;s.</NOTE> (and this, as I conceive,
is the meaning of what Mackenzie<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Tit. Murder, No. 19.</NOTE> has &s;aid upon the
&s;ubject), that in like manner as one may kill in defence of
one's life, if one cannot otherwi&s;e &s;ave it; &s;o an officer of the
law may kill in defence of his office and his warrant, if ne|ce&s;&s;ary
it be to the doing of his duty, and carrying his
commi&s;&s;ion into effect. In judging however of this nece&s;&s;ity,
and of the kind and degree of re&s;i&s;tance which &s;hall be held
to ju&s;tify on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, the rule, as far as can be ga|thered
from our records, and in it&s;elf a &s;alutary and rea|&s;onable
rule, appears to be, that none is held &s;ufficient,
<PB N="306" REF="365">
which does not carry evidence with it to the officer, that
his life <HI>&s;hall come</HI> to be in hazard, if he &s;hall per&s;i&s;t in the exe|cution
of his warrant. According to any light with which
the practice of pa&s;t times &s;upplies us, the dread of a wre&s;tling-bout
or &s;truggle, or even of a beating and brui&s;ing, in the
pro&s;ecution of the &s;ervice, &s;hall not be held a relevant de|fence;
nor indeed any thing &s;hort of the preparation of
lethal weapons again&s;t the officer, or of &s;uch a power and
force, as, in the whole circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, plainly
inform him, that but with the peril of his life he can|not
<HI>advance</HI> to do his duty. The difference, therefore, be|tween
the ca&s;e of the officer and of an ordinary man lies
here. An individual, to ju&s;tify his killing of the invader,
mu&s;t be in actual and in&s;tant danger of his own life <HI>as at
the moment of killing,</HI> and &s;o &s;ituated, that unle&s;s by &s;acri|ficing
the invader, he has no means of e&s;caping alive. But
the officer &s;hall be acquitted, if, at the time of killing, that
danger be <HI>in near and manife&s;t preparation for him,</HI> &s;o as in
rea&s;on to convince him that <HI>he &s;hall come to be in danger of his
life,</HI> in the farther pro&s;ecution of his duty, and although,
by de&s;erting the &s;ervice, he might at once put an end to the
hazard. A me&s;&s;enger, for in&s;tance, bearer of a caption, if, on
coming to the hou&s;e, he find a <HI>po&s;&s;e</HI> of the debtor's friends
po&s;ted at the door with drawn &s;words, and re&s;olute to
oppo&s;e his entry, may ju&s;tify the advancing and firing up|on
them, though no thru&s;t have yet been made at him,
and before coming within reach of their weapons; for his
life and theirs are not, in the&s;e circum&s;tances, of equal
value to the law, nor is he obliged to expo&s;e him&s;elf &s;o far
on their account<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>Mackenzie (Tit. Murder, No. 19.) quotes the ca&s;e of Macinto&s;h and Fle|ming, as a deci&s;ion on the power of me&s;&s;engers, when re&s;i&s;ted without the u&s;e of arms. But although that topic is di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, along with others, in a very full de|bate, it does not &s;eem to be decided by the interlocutor, which only finds that the libel was relevant, notwith&s;tanding the <HI>me&s;&s;enger's execution</HI> bearing the pannel Fleming to have been a witne&s;s to the caption. The me&s;&s;enger was not him&s;elf under trial; and the allegation again&s;t the pannels was, that they, out of the pre|&s;ence of the me&s;&s;enger, and after he had gone off, without &s;howing or attempting to execute the caption a&s;&s;aulted and killed the per&s;on again&s;t whom the caption, was, as al&s;o his brother, after the other had been &s;lain. Farther, this was alleged to be done while the&s;e two per&s;ons were flying, and were pur&s;ued by &s;ix or &s;even.</P>
<P>Another ca&s;e to which reference has often been made, is that of Archibald Beath, June 14. 1672. The Lords of Privy Council had i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, authori&s;ing the lieges to hinder the importation of Iri&s;h victual, and to &s;eize the &s;ame on any attempt to land it. A boat, loaded with Iri&s;h victual had come to Lamla&s;h in Arran, where Mr Beath, a clergyman, and a number of other per&s;ons, armed, &s;eized and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. Afterwards, in the ab&s;ence of Beath, the crew recovered it from certain of the party with whom it was left in charge, and &s;et &s;ail to make their e&s;cape. Beath and his armed party in another boat pur&s;ued, and, on refu&s;al to &s;urrender, fired, and killed two of the crew. Now in this there was a plain precipitation and exce&s;s. It was the u&s;e of fire arms again&s;t a party who were not armed, and flying, and who are neither alleged nor proved to have offered any violence to Beath's party, but only to have threatened to run down his boat: Not to mention that it might well be doubted whether the pro|clamation meant to authori&s;e a &s;eizure by force of arms, or only <HI>civiliter</HI> by more orderly means. The Court repelled his defences, and the jury found him guilty, but the royal mercy interpo&s;ed. The proof in the ca&s;e is &s;hort, and only e&s;ta|bli&s;hes the facts of &s;hooting and killing, without any of the alleged circum&s;tances, prior or concomitant.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="366">
5. ANOTHER article, which will require our attention, is
the nature of a &s;oldier's privilege,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide by Soldiers in their Duty.</NOTE> when oppo&s;ed or a&s;&s;ault|ed
in execution of his duty. Now, this may &s;eem to be en|titled
to at lea&s;t as liberal a con&s;truction as that of any officer
of the law, on account of the nature of the man's employ|ment;
maintained as he is by the State, for the very pur|po&s;e
of repre&s;&s;ing the di&s;orderly, and being trained there|in
to contempt and re&s;i&s;tance of all inva&s;ion, and more|over
being him&s;elf liable in high pains for di&s;obedience or
<PB N="308" REF="367">
neglect of orders, and even for any common regard of his
own &s;afety in the execution of them. All which con&s;ide|rations,
as they &s;erve to &s;eparate the &s;oldier from the ma&s;s
of ordinary citizens, and to nouri&s;h a peculiar character in
him, and a higher jealou&s;y of di&s;grace or affront, (without
which he were unfit for the duties of his profe&s;&s;ion); &s;o do
they in ju&s;tice require a higher allowance of his forward|ne&s;s
in the maintaining of his &s;ervice, what&s;oever it is for
the time, and are withal a warning to every one, not to
mole&s;t or meddle with him therein.</P>
<P>THE preci&s;e boundaries of this allowance, I &s;hall not at|tempt,
(indeed I &s;hould be loath if I could), to define. This,
however, in a general way, the judgments of the Court
enable me to &s;ay, that an inva&s;ion with mortal weapons, or
an actual and in&s;tant danger of death, is not nece&s;&s;ary to
entitle the &s;oldier to u&s;e the arms which the State has given
him; and therefore given him, that he and his duty may be
&s;ecure, and in no danger of &s;urpri&s;e, or material hinder|ance.
In putting them into his hands, it is the intention of
the State, and of the law, that in every ca&s;e he &s;hall keep
them &s;afe, and his per&s;on in condition to u&s;e them with ef|fect;
and that on any po&s;t or &s;tation which is a&s;&s;igned him,
he &s;hall maintain it &s;urely, not only again&s;t actual capture
of his arms, but again&s;t any con&s;iderable ri&s;k of &s;uch a mi&s;|fortune.
Which if he actually &s;uffers by the lo&s;s of them,
or if he &s;hall quit his &s;tation without being relieved, he is
liable to death by the mutiny-act, which is an annual &s;tatute,
and part of the &s;y&s;tem of our law. Not only, therefore,
the ho&s;tile inva&s;ion of his per&s;on with arms, but any violent
attack upon him with other weapons, or any outrageous and
alarming tumult rai&s;ed again&s;t him, when at his po&s;t or in
his duty, authori&s;es him to be active in repelling it, and
<PB N="309" REF="368">
&s;hall indemnify him for any &s;laughter that en&s;ues. Not
that he can be ju&s;tified (no one can be of this opinion) for
mortally re&s;enting a &s;light indignity, or for quelling every
in&s;ignificant di&s;turbance with force of arms; but this only,
that being invaded in his duty, he &s;hall be ju&s;tified by a
much lower violence and interference, than would be ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to excu&s;e another man. The following are among
the ca&s;es, which may be mentioned in evidence of this ex|po&s;ition
of the law.</P>
<P>On the 3d of Augu&s;t 1692,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide by Soldiers in their Duty.</NOTE> Captain John Wallace was in|dicted
for the murder of three boys, and the wounding of
&s;everal others, by ordering his company to fire upon a crowd
of people in the &s;treet. The pannel an&s;wered, that he had
orders from the Privy Council to keep guard with his com|pany,
at the Abbey of Holyroodhou&s;e; that there had for &s;ome
days been tumults in the city, and the rabble had threaten|ed
mi&s;chief to his guard, and to the building; and that at
length, on the day libelled, they a&s;&s;embled in numbers, &s;ome
of them with arms, and came down to his po&s;t, where
(but without u&s;ing mortal weapons) they beat his centinels;
and that though warned they per&s;i&s;ted to advance again&s;t
his company; whereupon, to maintain his po&s;t, he gave or|ders
to fire. The fir&s;t part of this defence, relative to the
con&s;piracy and threats of mi&s;chief, was found relevant to
re&s;trict the libel to an arbitrary pain, and the actual a&s;&s;ault,
to elide the charge <HI>&s;impliciter</HI><NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Interlocutor: &startq;And finds this defence, that on the Sabbath night, or &s;hort|ly before, a rabble did meet in &s;everal places in great numbers, and that &s;eve|rals of them did declare to John Pater&s;on, their re&s;olution to trouble the pan|nel and his guaird, and to pillage the Abbay, relevant to re&s;trict to an arbitra|ry puni&s;hment; and finds, that the following defence, that the &s;aid rabble did, in a tumultuous manner, come down the Canongate with &s;words and fyre arms, and did beat &s;ome of the pannell's centinalls; and that being de&s;yred to &s;tand, they notwith&s;tanding advanced &s;o near, that the pannell could &s;peak to them, and after he had de&s;yred them to remove, or be at their hazard, they notwith&s;tanding thereof, &s;till per&s;i&s;ted to advance, relevant to elide that part of the lybel <HI>&s;impliciter.</HI>&endq; Augu&s;t 4. 1692.</NOTE>.

<P>IN this ca&s;e there had been arms among the rabble;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide by Soldier in his Duty.</NOTE>
though it is not &s;aid that any u&s;e was made of them, before
the order was given to fire. But in the ca&s;e of William
Hunt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 19. 1711.</NOTE> dragoon, the invaders were not provided with any war|like
weapons. This man was indicted for the murder of
Henry Macmillan, committed on the &s;treet of Dalkeith, by
a violent blow given him on the head with a clubbed mu&s;|quet
from behind; whereby the mu&s;quet was broken, and
the man &s;o hurt, that he died on the &s;ucceeding day. He
pleaded, that the decea&s;ed was one of a rabble upon the
&s;treet who had in&s;ulted, abu&s;ed, and beaten down certain of
the &s;oldiers; and that on this occa&s;ion the guard, of which
Hunt was one, being ordered to relieve them, and an attack
being made on them with poles, clubs, &s;hovels, and other the
like ha&s;ty weapons, he killed Macmillan in the execution of
this duty. In the&s;e terms the defence was found relevant
to a&s;&s;oilzie; and at the &s;ame time this other defence, that the
&s;laughter was committed <HI>in rixa,</HI> of which the decea&s;ed
was him&s;elf the author, was found only relevant to Hunt, as
an ordinary individual, to re&s;trict the libel to an arbitrary

The jury found a &s;pecial verdict, which did
not e&s;tabli&s;h that Hunt was the per&s;on who &s;truck the de|cea&s;ed;
and he was therefore a&s;&s;oilzied.</P>
<P>A THIRD,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide by Soldier in his Duty.</NOTE> and no le&s;s appo&s;ite ca&s;e, is that of John Will|hou&s;e,
&s;ergeant, Thomas Turner, Thomas Fra&s;er, and John
Muircock, private &s;oldiers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 16. June 15. &amp; 16. 1730.</NOTE> indicted for the murder of Chri&s;|tian
Greig and George Thom&s;on, two of a multitude, upon
whom they had fired. The ca&s;e was thus. The pannels, a|long
with one &s;oldier more, had been called out for protection
of a cargo of contraband &s;pirits, which was already in the
hands of the revenue-officer, who had impre&s;&s;ed the King's
mark upon the ca&s;ks. While po&s;ted at the hou&s;e where the
ca&s;ks lay, and in the ab&s;ence (as far as appears) of the re|venue-officer,
the &s;oldiers were a&s;&s;aulted by a mob of men
and women, who with &s;tones, clubs, and the like, broke in
upon the party; and among other injuries heat down one of
the &s;oldiers to the ground with a plough-paddle, took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of his mu&s;quet, and abu&s;ed his per&s;on, while lying
on the ground. In the&s;e circum&s;tances the &s;ergeant, with|out
retiring into the hou&s;e, gave orders to his party to fire;
and two per&s;ons were killed. The Court found the defence

pannels were a&s;&s;oilzied.</P>
<P>A MORE noted ca&s;e than any of the&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide by Soldier in his Duty.</NOTE> owing to the differ|ent
opinion which was entertained of it in the &s;upreme
and inferior Courts, is that of Macadam and Long, a cor|poral
and private &s;oldier, tried in the Court of Admiralty,
on the 25th September 1735, for the murder of Hugh Fra|&s;er,
younger of Belnain. According to their defence, the
occa&s;ion of the &s;laughter was as follows. They were quar|tered
at Inverne&s;s, and were called by the revenue-officer,
to go on board the cu&s;tomhou&s;e boat, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his
duty. They were ten men in all in the boat, of whom five
were armed; and in the cour&s;e of their expedition they
came up with a boat, in which was Fra&s;er and other ten
per&s;ons more, with a cargo of &s;muggled goods on board;
but excepting one, who had a pi&s;tol, all of them provided
with cudgels only. Words en&s;ued between the parties; and
Fra&s;er, followed by four more, one of them bearing a pi&s;tol,
leaped into the cu&s;tomhou&s;e boat, and invaded the officer
and his a&s;&s;i&s;tants. The officer was knocked down, and his
blunderbu&s;s thrown into the &s;ea; the &s;oldiers arms were
&s;eized, and attempted to be wre&s;ted from them; and the
men them&s;elves, in the &s;cu&s;&s;le, were thrown down; in which
<PB N="313" REF="372">
&s;ituation one or other of them thru&s;t at Fra&s;er with his bay|onet,
and killed him. On this narrative, a double plea was
&s;et up for the pannels: that they killed upon re&s;i&s;tance in
execution of their duty; at lea&s;t that they killed in &s;elf-de|fence,
being in danger of their lives. The Judge-Admiral &s;u&s;|tained
the plea of &s;elf-defence.<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">&startq;And &s;u&s;tains the defence of &s;elf-defence proponed by the pannels, that the killing of the &s;aid Hugh Fra&s;er by the pannels, or either of them, was in the nece&s;&s;ary defence of their lives; and repels the whole other defences proponed for the pannels.&endq;</NOTE>, and repelled the other; and
the pannels were in con&s;equence found guilty, and condem|ned
to die; the jury being of opinion, &startq;that the killing
of the &s;aid Hugh Fra&s;er was not in the nece&s;&s;ary de|fence
of their lives.&endq; Now, on review in the Court of
Ju&s;ticiary, this &s;entence was &s;u&s;pended,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 5. 1735.</NOTE> and for the rea&s;on
announced in the&s;e words: &startq;Fand, that the &s;aid Judge hath
committed iniquity in re&s;tricting the defences proponed
for the &s;u&s;penders to the nece&s;&s;ary defence of their lives,
and repelling the other defences proponed for them; and
therefore the &s;aid Lord Ju&s;tice-Clerk and Lords Commi&s;|&s;ioners
of Ju&s;ticiary did &s;u&s;pend the interloquitor on the
relevancy, verdict returned by the a&s;&s;ize, and &s;entence of
death pronounced by the &s;aid Judge, with all that had fol|lowed,
or might follow thereon, <HI>&s;impliciter.</HI>&endq; On the 20th of
the &s;ame month, in pur&s;uance of their petition, and the Lord
Advocate's con&s;ent, the pannels were di&s;charged from cu&s;|tody,
upon caution found to an&s;wer to any charge which
might be brought again&s;t them. But they were not again
indicted.</P>
<P>THERE are two precedents more, worthy to be ob&s;er|ved;
the ca&s;e of Henry Hawkins, July 17. 24. 1769, and
the ca&s;e of Macfarlane and Firmin, February 4. 1788. Haw|kins
<PB N="314" REF="373">
was on guard with his party, as corporal, at the
guard-hou&s;e of Gla&s;gow, where a rabble attacked them with
&s;taves and &s;tones, and after hurting &s;everal of the party, at
length beat down and cut Hawkins; who therefore drew his
bayonet and &s;lew Hyndman, a butcher, the per&s;on who had
beat him down. The jury found him not guilty; in which
they had the approbation of the Court.</P>
<P>THERE was the like concurrence of opinion in the ca&s;e of
Macfarlane and Firmin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide by Soldier in his Duty,</NOTE> which was this. Macfarlane was
an officer of exci&s;e, and had carried Firmin, a corporal of
the 39th regiment of foot, and his party along with him, by
water, to a village named Denoon in Ayr&s;hire, there to
&s;eize certain unlicenced &s;tills. This purpo&s;e they &s;o far ac|compli&s;hed,
as to depo&s;it one &s;till in their boat, under the
care of one only of the boatmen, who had been left there in
the charge of it. By this time the village was alarmed;
and the inhabitants ri&s;ing again&s;t them in numbers, as they
were proceeding in their &s;earch, a&s;&s;ailed them with &s;tones,
and compelled them to de&s;ert the &s;ervice, and retire towards
the beach. Meanwhile, one Kennedy, the man who&s;e &s;till
had been &s;eized, was at the boat before them; leaped into
it, knocked down the boatman, and was proceeding, with
all &s;peed, to put off from &s;hore. At this moment, Firmin,
ob&s;erving that the populace &s;till continued to pre&s;s them to|wards
the water, and that in this way only they could re|tire
in &s;afety, took aim at Kennedy from &s;ome di&s;tance, and
fired and killed him; and thus they made good their &s;eizure
and their retreat. At calling the libel again&s;t the&s;e pan|nels,
the Lord Advocate re&s;tricted it to a charge of culpable
homicide only. But the jury were of opinion that the &s;laugh|ter
<PB N="315" REF="374">
was <HI>inculpable,</HI> and found a verdict of <HI>not guilty</HI> in fa|vour
of both the pannels.</P>
<P>LAST of all,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide by Soldier in his Duty.</NOTE> notice &s;hall be taken of the ca&s;e of Wood|we&s;t
a &s;oldier of the 37th regiment of foot, tried at Gla&s;|gow,
before the Lords Ju&s;tice-Clerk and Henderland, in
April 1792. This man was upon duty as centinel at the
goal of Gla&s;gow. A brawl had taken place upon the &s;treet,
hard by his po&s;t, between certain &s;triplings on the one part,
and two &s;oldiers and a woman on the other, who being mo|le&s;ted,
and pelted with &s;tones, took refuge in a &s;ort of entry
or pa&s;&s;age, behind his po&s;t. In this &s;ituation the rabble, many
of whom were boys, but came to be mingled with grown men,
continued to throw &s;tones, and to threaten them with vio|lence;
they al&s;o in&s;i&s;ted with the centinel either to turn out
the &s;oldiers and the woman from their place of refuge, or
to let the populace come upon his po&s;t, and pa&s;s his centry-box,
and execute their will on the objects of their di&s;plea|&s;ure.
The centinel refu&s;ed to do either; and then they
began to annoy him in the &s;ame fa&s;hion with &s;tones and
mud; abu&s;ing him likewi&s;e with foul names, and pre&s;&s;ing
clo&s;e in upon his po&s;t. He, in return, advi&s;ed them to keep
off, and warned them that he &s;hould be obliged to fire, if
they per&s;i&s;ted. The throwing of &s;tones continued however
for &s;ome minutes, notwith&s;tanding that, in the cour&s;e of this
time, he endeavoured to deter them, by making preparation,
as if to charge them with his arms. At la&s;t, when many
of the rabble had pre&s;&s;ed &s;o clo&s;e upon him as to be within
a mu&s;quet's length, he made ready, and, after waiting a
moment, fired. The &s;hot took place and killed a boy. It
appeared upon the trial, that though &s;everal &s;tones had
hit his arms, the man him&s;elf had never been &s;truck, nor
<PB N="316" REF="375">
his per&s;on in any degree been injured. But on the other
hand, it was given in evidence, that it was part of the orders
of every centinel to keep his po&s;t clear, and his per&s;on free
of all ri&s;k of &s;urpri&s;e, or of &s;eizure of his arms; as al&s;o to quell
every manner of di&s;turbance rai&s;ed again&s;t him on his po&s;t,
and to protect any per&s;on, who &s;hould take refuge there in
a &s;ituation of di&s;tre&s;s. The Judges were agreed, that though
the term might not appear in our proceedings, yet the thing
it&s;elf of ju&s;tifiable homicide was well known in the law of
Scotland; and that the ca&s;e of a centinel who kills in de|fence
of his po&s;t, where he is unlawfully and without pro|vocation
a&s;&s;aulted, and which he cannot leave without or|ders,
is a ca&s;e of that de&s;cription. The pannel had a ver|dict
of <HI>not guilty,</HI> and was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed <HI>&s;impliciter</HI> from the bar.</P>
<P>IN an&s;wer to the&s;e numerous and uniform precedents,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;e of Captain Porteous.</NOTE> re|ference
may perhaps be made to the noted ca&s;e of Captain
Porteous, tried on the 19th July 1736. The general outline
of this ca&s;e is well known. That he, being Captain of the
city guard of Edinburgh, and having in that capacity to at|tend
the execution of one Wil&s;on a &s;muggler, who was fa|voured
by the people; and a tumult being rai&s;ed after the
man had hung on the gibbet for &s;ome time, with the view,
as was &s;uppo&s;ed, of cutting down the body and taking po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of it, in order to u&s;e means for its revival; and in
the cour&s;e of this attempt the city guard being a&s;&s;aulted
with &s;tones; he, Porteous, gave orders to his men to fire,
and al&s;o fired him&s;elf among the people; whereby &s;eventeen
per&s;ons were killed or wounded. The jury found a &s;pecial
verdict in the&s;e words: &startq;Find it proven, that the &s;aid John
Porteous, pannel, fired a gun among the people a&s;&s;embled at
the place of execution, and time libelled. As al&s;o, that he
<PB N="317" REF="376">
gave orders to the &s;oldiers under his command to fire,
and upon his and their &s;o firing, the per&s;ons mentioned in
the indictment were killed and wounded. And find it
proven, that the pannel and his guard were attacked and
beat by &s;everal &s;tones of a con&s;iderable bigne&s;s thrown
among&s;t them by the multitude; whereby &s;everal of the
&s;oldiers were brui&s;ed and wounded.&endq; Upon this verdict
Porteous had &s;entence of death. On application to the
Crown, execution was ordered to be re&s;pited; and it was
believed that this order might probably be the fore-runner
of a pardon. But &s;uch was the rage excited among the
populace by the pro&s;pect of his e&s;caping the puni&s;hment
which they thought due to his crime, that joining in a va&s;t,
yet well concerted tumult, they for the time made them|&s;elves
ma&s;ters of the city; and having broken into the goal,
conveyed their victim from thence to the common place of
execution, where they &s;acrificed him to their revenge, with

<P>BUT between the ca&s;e of Porteous,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;e of Captain Porteous.</NOTE> and any of the pre|cedents
which have been cited on the other &s;ide, there is
this material circum&s;tance of di&s;tinction; that the a&s;&s;embly
on which the &s;laughter was committed, was not an illegal
and criminal, but a lawful, and (as it mu&s;t be e&s;teemed)
even laudable a&s;&s;embly, in which by far the greater part of
the per&s;ons pre&s;ent were innocently and properly met, and
neither in truth were, nor could in law be held, participant
of the evil purpo&s;es of tho&s;e among them, who came there
with intent to re&s;cue the convict. Now to <HI>ju&s;tify</HI> the firing
upon a multitude of this de&s;cription, would have required
higher provocation than that which is mentioned in the ver|dict,
and far more favourable circum&s;tances of delay, warning,
<PB N="318" REF="377">
and forbearance, than were nece&s;&s;ary in any of the other
ca&s;es, or than this unfortunate pannel could allege. The
tumult had not been of long continuance, at the time when
he gave order to fire; and this he did without authority
from the magi&s;trates of the place, who were at hand to be
con&s;ulted on the occa&s;ion. Neither does it appear that he
ever warned the people to de&s;i&s;t, or gave notice of his
intention to fire, or allowed time for the peaceable and
well di&s;po&s;ed to withdraw them&s;elves from the danger. The
fire too was not directed to that quarter only, from which
the &s;tones were thrown; and &s;tepping out of his proper duty,
Porteous acted the part of a private &s;oldier, and was him|&s;elf
the fir&s;t to di&s;charge his piece. Certainly, in the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances
his conduct could not be fully <HI>ju&s;tified.</HI> Whether
his offence might not properly have been referred to &s;ome
of the lower &s;pecies of homicide, if the jury, in their ver|dict,
had &s;tated all tho&s;e favourable circum&s;tances for the
pannel which the proof warranted<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">It was <HI>admitted</HI> on the part of the Crown, that the magi&s;trates, in the fear of a re&s;cue, had given orders to the guard to load, before proceeding to take charge of the convict; and that a body of the King's forces had been called into the city, and a&s;&s;urance given them of permi&s;&s;ion to fire, if they were attacked. Farther, it &s;eems to be <HI>proved,</HI> that before the order to fire, the convict's body was actually cut down by the mob; that the guard were pre&s;&s;ed upon and thrown into di&s;or|der; that the executioner was cut in the face with a &s;tone, to the effu&s;ion of his blood; that a drummer was cut in the head to the effu&s;ion of his blood, and his drum beaten to pieces in the &s;ame way; that a &s;oldier of the guard had his &s;houlder-blade broken; and that the pannel him&s;elf was &s;truck with a &s;tone, be|fore he fired. The verdict does not &s;tate any of the&s;e things, and the Court could not con&s;ider them.

<P>PERHAPS,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;e of Samuel Mathews.</NOTE> reference may al&s;o be made to the ca&s;e of Sa|muel
Mathews, tried in Augu&s;t and September 1721, for the
murder of Thomas Boyd. Mathews was one of a &s;ergeant's
party of twelve, who had orders to patrole the &s;treets of
Edinburgh, on account of tumults, which were apprehended
at the time. At the port of the city, called the Netherbow,
and in a lane adjacent, (Leith-wynd), the party had met
with abu&s;e of words and other annoyance: It was even al|leged,
(but the proof of this entirely failed), that a &s;hot was
fired at them from among a rabble within the gate and city|wall.
In return, Mathews and other two fired without or|ders,
and Thomas Boyd was killed. His defences were re|pelled,
and the jury found him guilty; but &s;entence was
prevented by a pardon. That which &s;eems chiefly to have
weighed in this ca&s;e, was the circum&s;tance of firing without
orders from the commanding officer, and indeed again&s;t his
injunction. For it was &s;tated, and appears to have been
true, that when certain of the men levelled, the &s;ergeant
&s;truck up their pieces, and led off the party into another
&s;treet, (the Canongate); upon which Mathews and two
more broke their rank, and turning towards the port, di|rected
their fire that way.</P>
<P>YET,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;e of Soldier acting without Orders.</NOTE> though it may be generally, it is not without ex|ception
true, that a &s;oldier can only be ju&s;tified for that

for it may happen him to be beaten down, and to be
in in&s;tant danger of lo&s;ing his arms, before his officer can
interpo&s;e, either to a&s;&s;i&s;t or direct him. In like manner, it
<PB N="320" REF="379">
is generally true that an officer and his party, called to a&s;|&s;i&s;t
the civil magi&s;trate in the quelling of a tumult, mu&s;t
wait his orders to act again&s;t the rioters, and &s;hall not be ex|cu&s;ed,
how great &s;oever the commotion, if they proceed with|out
that authority. Yet, if be&s;ide per&s;i&s;ting in the original
purpo&s;e of mi&s;chief, (as to which, until the magi&s;trate autho|ri&s;e
them, the &s;oldiers are but as &s;o many individuals), the of|fenders
&s;hall proceed to a&s;&s;ault, and outrageou&s;ly to abu&s;e the
&s;oldiers them&s;elves, &s;o as to put them in plain hazard of being
driven from their po&s;t, or of lo&s;ing their arms, or being di&s;|abled
for the &s;ervice; certainly, as men and as &s;oldiers, they
have right to defend them&s;elves from the&s;e injuries, with|out
leave of the magi&s;trate, who is blameable that he does
not permit them. Being brought thither at his in&s;tance,
the whole party are here in the &s;ame &s;ituation as a cen|tinel,
and cannot retire until he di&s;mi&s;s them; neither,
any more than the centinel, are they to remain there, to
be made pri&s;oners, or to be maimed and di&s;abled. In
ca&s;e of attack made on them on any other occa&s;ion, and
when under command of their own officers only, this
would be their undoubted right; and certainly it is not
the le&s;s &s;o, that they are here attending in aid of the ma|gi&s;trate,
who owes protection to them equally as to the
re&s;t of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, and the more to them, as they
have been brought by his act into this &s;ituation of danger.
It is to be ob&s;erved, that neither in the ca&s;e of Willhou&s;e, nor
of Macadam and Long, was there any order on the part of
the revenue-officer, to repel the attack by force.</P>

re&s;i&s;tance, to which, from the nature of their duty, and
the lawle&s;s character of tho&s;e again&s;t whom they have
to act, they are, perhaps, more expo&s;ed than any other of
the &s;ervants of the State. Their duty is, withal, of great
importance to the public, to be performed with activity and
zeal, and cannot be done with effect, unle&s;s in&s;tant advan|tage

in the very act which they endeavour to protect by this re|&s;i&s;tance.
In ju&s;tice, therefore, to the men, the Legi&s;lature
has made provi&s;ion towards the better protection of their

But that which would have been implied at common

<PB N="322" REF="381">
authori&s;es the officers of cu&s;toms or exci&s;e, and their a&s;&s;i&s;|tants,
when re&s;i&s;ted in the &s;earching for or &s;eizing of goods,
by per&s;ons who are pa&s;&s;ing with the &s;ame, armed with of|fen&s;ive
weapons, &startq;to oppo&s;e force to force, and to endea|vour
by the &s;ame methods that are violently u&s;ed again&s;t
them, and by which their lives are endangered, to defend
them&s;elves, and execute the duty of their office:&endq; In
doing which, if any per&s;on &s;hall be killed, and the officer or
his a&s;&s;i&s;tant &s;hall be pro&s;ecuted, he may plead the benefit of
the &s;tatute. In truth, this direction is nothing more than
declaratory of the powers which ari&s;e to the officer <HI>vi juris,</HI>
(and on the &s;ame principle as already explained in the ca&s;e of
the officers of ju&s;tice), from the command of the law to him
to make the &s;eizure. For if the &s;muggler oppo&s;e him there|in
with mortal or offen&s;ive weapons, whereby the officer
<HI>&s;hall come</HI> to be in danger of his life, if, as by the law en|couraged,
and in duty bound, he &s;hall <HI>advance</HI> and per&s;i&s;t

by employment of the nece&s;&s;ary means, and cannot
be an&s;werable for any mi&s;chief that en&s;ues. This &s;tatute is
virtually confirmed by a later one, that of the 24th Geo. III.
c. 47. which has made it puni&s;hable with death, to wound,
or even to &s;hoot at, any officer of the navy, cu&s;toms, or ex|ci&s;e,
(or his a&s;&s;i&s;tants), acting in the execution of his duty.
It follows, that the officer, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, who has thus a ca|pital

at the utmo&s;t peril of the criminal, in the pro&s;ecution of

<PB N="323" REF="382">
of interference between the revenue-officer and the

of our enquiry, if we &s;hould attempt to &s;ettle, How far he
can be ju&s;tified in the u&s;e of force, upon the re&s;i&s;tance or re|fu&s;al
of what the law entitles him to demand. But in ge|neral,
it &s;eems to be true of tho&s;e numerous entries and vi&s;i|tations,
which the Exci&s;e laws have ordered in regard to
certain manufactures, and the &s;ale of certain articles, and
whereof the refu&s;al expo&s;es to very high pecuniary penal|ties,
that the Legi&s;lature has not meant to authori&s;e the u&s;e

purpo&s;e of hindering any recour&s;e to it, and of outweighing
any po&s;&s;ible profit which the dealer can have by his di&s;obe|dience
to the law. It is al&s;o to be remembered, that the
offenders in this way, are not, like &s;mugglers, needy and
de&s;perate per&s;ons, or &s;trangers, who mu&s;t be quelled upon
the &s;pot, but per&s;ons domiciliated in the country, and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
of effects here, which, as well as their per&s;ons, are
acce&s;&s;ible to the law, for puni&s;hment of their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>III. I SHALL not enlarge farther on this part of our &s;ub|ject;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide in de|fence of Life a|gain&s;t a Felon.</NOTE>
of which &s;ufficient has now been &s;aid, to give a general
notion of the principles by which it is governed. But it is
nece&s;&s;ary to examine that &s;ort of homicide al&s;o, which is
ju&s;tifiable upon nece&s;&s;ity of a private nature, or out of duty
to one's &s;elf. The mo&s;t indi&s;putable in&s;tance of this cla&s;s,
is &s;laughter committed in the nece&s;&s;ary defence of one's own
life, again&s;t an attempt feloniou&s;ly to take it away. I &s;ay
again&s;t a felonious attempt to murder; for I am not at pre|&s;ent
&s;peaking of that &s;elf-defence, which may become nece&s;|&s;ary
in the cour&s;e of an affray, or occa&s;ional quarrel, be|tween
per&s;ons who have fallen out upon the &s;pot, and, in the
<PB N="324" REF="383">
beginning, are probably, both of them, more or le&s;s in fault.
Tho&s;e two kinds of &s;elf-defence are not grounded in the
preci&s;e &s;ame rea&s;ons, nor &s;ubject in all re&s;pects to the &s;ame
con&s;truction; nor indeed are they attended, in every in|&s;tance,
with the &s;ame benefit of an ab&s;olute and entire ju&s;ti|fication.
One difference between them is, that to enjoy the
plea of &s;elf-defence, as upon an occa&s;ional quarrel, the &s;ur|viver
mu&s;t have given back, and done all that in him lay,
to take him&s;elf out of the affray, without &s;hedding the blood
of his antagoni&s;t. But it were unrea&s;onable to exact the
&s;ame temperance and <HI>moderamen tutelae</HI> of him, who being on
the high-way, and alone, is &s;uddenly thru&s;t at from be|hind
by an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, or has a pi&s;tol fired in his face, by one
who &s;prings out upon him from the &s;ide of the way, with
intent to murder. There is in &s;uch a ca&s;e no manner of
po&s;&s;ible or imputable wrong on the part of the per&s;on a&s;|&s;ailed,
for which he &s;hould make amends by retreating:
In duty to him&s;elf, he is rather called on, in&s;tantly, and
without &s;hrinking, to &s;tand on his defence, that the a&s;&s;ailant
may not continue to have the advantage of him, but be ter|rified
from the farther pro&s;ecution of his felonious purpo&s;e.
To what greater lengths he may carry the attempt, or
what other means he may have prepared to accompli&s;h his
end, a per&s;on invaded in this &s;udden manner cannot know,
nor is obliged to con&s;ider in &s;uch a moment. He is entitled
to &s;uppo&s;e the wor&s;t of that which has been begun in &s;o ba&s;e
a fa&s;hion; and, by the law of nature, has therefore right to
put him&s;elf in &s;ecurity by the only certain means, the in|&s;tant
&s;laughter of the a&s;&s;ailant; who is no true man, that
his innocent victim &s;hould contend with him on equal terms,
but a great criminal, taken in the commi&s;&s;ion of a known
<PB N="325" REF="384">
felony, and the fit object, therefore, of immediate and &s;um|mary
ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems al&s;o to be true,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide in de|fence of Life a|gain&s;t a Felon.</NOTE> that the right of &s;laughter on &s;uch
occa&s;ions is not confined to the per&s;on him&s;elf who is attacked,
but is common to him, (which never can be true of &s;elf-de|fence
upon a quarrel), with his friends or &s;ervants, or others
who are along with him. Nay, it may even be maintained,
that though the a&s;&s;ailant give back on the re&s;i&s;tance, yet the
innocent party is not for this obliged immediately to de&s;i&s;t,
(&s;ince it may be only a feigned retreat, in order to call a&s;|&s;ociates,
or to renew the a&s;&s;ault with better advantage), but
may pur&s;ue and u&s;e his weapons, until he be completely out
of danger.</P>
<P>HAVING accompli&s;hed this object, how far he has right
&s;till to pur&s;ue the offender onward, for the purpo&s;e of taking
him and bringing him to ju&s;tice, and to kill him if he will
not be taken, is a que&s;tion which &s;eems to hinge upon this
other, What powers has an officer of the law for the &s;ame
purpo&s;e? For what&s;oever powers the officer hath by rea&s;on
of his &s;tation, the &s;ame hath the party in this ca&s;e by rea&s;on
of his certain knowledge of the offender, and the pre&s;ent
opportunity of bringing him to ju&s;tice. In general, it is
obvious, that all the powers which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, belong to
him for the ends of ju&s;tice only, and in nowi&s;e for tho&s;e of
re&s;entment or revenge. So that if he kill the criminal
after he is &s;ecured, or after he is reduced to &s;uch difficulties
that he cannot e&s;cape, or may probably be taken alive, it is
at lea&s;t a culpable homicide; and if there has been any in|terval
for reflection, it may even amount to murder. For it
matters not how vile or mean the per&s;on &s;lain, if he is killed
out of deliberate cruelty, or revenge. The&s;e ob&s;ervations I
<PB N="326" REF="385">
only offer as my own &s;entiments; which are not indeed con|tradicted
by any thing in our practice, but have not the au|thority
of any judgment of a court of law. Indeed, I cannot
find, that any proper ca&s;e has ever happened for the illu&s;tra|tion
of this &s;ort of &s;elf-defence. And the other is &s;o much a
more frequent &s;ituation in practice, that the lawyers not of
this only, but other countries, have chiefly directed their at|tention
to it, and have formed their general precepts re|&s;pecting
the duty of &s;elf-defence, with a view to it alone.</P>
<P>IN like manner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide in hinderance of Rape.</NOTE> as a man may kill in re&s;i&s;tance of an at|tempt
on his life, a woman al&s;o hath right to kill in re&s;i&s;t|ance
of that injury to her honour, which cannot be repair|ed
if it be committed, and of which &s;he is entitled to feel the
highe&s;t re&s;entment. By parity of rea&s;on, the hu&s;band or
the father of a woman thus invaded, has right to feel the
like re&s;entment, and to defend her from this extreme and
cruel injury, at the hazard of the invader.</P>
<P>THE right of re&s;i&s;tance unto death is not however li|mited
to ca&s;es of attempt upon one's per&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide in de|fence of Pro|perty.</NOTE> but equally ap|plies
to inva&s;ion of one's property, if it be made in that
forcible and felonious manner, which naturally carries
fear along with it. I &s;ay in a manner which is at once
forcible and felonious; for I conceive that the right fails,
if either of the&s;e circum&s;tances be wanting. It may be a
high, and even a capital crime, to pick a per&s;on's pocket of
large &s;ums of money, or to &s;teal his linen to a great value
from the hedge. But he certainly &s;hall not be ju&s;tified, if
in&s;tead of &s;eizing he in&s;tantly &s;tab the pick-pocket, on di&s;|covering
what he is about, or if he &s;hoot the thief from be|hind
the hedge, before he know that he is detected.</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="386">
AS little will the force be &s;ufficient, if it is not of a cri|minal
or felonious nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide in de|fence of Pro|perty.</NOTE> but a tre&s;pa&s;s only, or other low
offence. A few in&s;tances will illu&s;trate this matter. It
will not be lawful for me to kill my neighbour, who per|&s;i&s;ts
to &s;earch for game upon my lands without my leave; or
who, on a mi&s;take of our marches, &s;hall poind and carry off
my cattle pa&s;turing on my grounds, in the belief, though
gro&s;sly wrong, that the grounds are his. Or what if he
come at the head of his &s;ervants and people, to throw down
a dike or other bulwark within my property, or to throw
open an alleged common, about which there is a controver&s;y
between us? In any of the&s;e ca&s;es, &s;ince the tre&s;pa&s;s on the
property is not coupled to an a&s;&s;ault on the per&s;on, (for if
it were otherwi&s;e the que&s;tion would be far more delicate),
it is grounded in the highe&s;t ju&s;tice, that the blood of the
a&s;&s;ailant cannot be &s;hed, to prevent the injury. For neither
is there the &s;ame depravity on his part, nor the &s;ame trepi|dation
and alarm in the per&s;on a&s;&s;aulted; as well as there is
no cau&s;e to believe that the tre&s;pa&s;&s;er will fly from ju&s;tice,
on account of &s;uch a fault, or that full amends may not be
had in cour&s;e of law. But it is quite otherwi&s;e if I am at|tacked
on the high-way, under night, and in a &s;olitary place,
to be robbed. This injury can only be accompli&s;hed by
&s;ubduing my per&s;on, and I have rea&s;on to dread all &s;ort of
violence on refu&s;al, or even delay to comply; nor am I
even &s;ure to be exempt from it, though I deliver: be&s;ides
that, if once &s;urrendered, my property is lo&s;t, with but little
chance of recovery at any after time. Meeting in this man|ner,
the a&s;&s;ailant and I are therefore in a &s;tate of open war|fare,
in which I have no terms to keep with him, and am
under no obligation in law, whatever compa&s;&s;ion may &s;ug|ge&s;t,
to con&s;ult his &s;afety, but may prevent and cha&s;ti&s;e his

hou&s;e in the night, to &s;teal. But though this be the example
given in the&s;e authorities, it would not be rea&s;onable to un|der&s;tand
them in a re&s;tricted &s;en&s;e, &s;uch as would limit the
privilege to the ca&s;e of an attempt to &s;teal only; but rather
as grounds, <HI>a fortiori,</HI> for authori&s;ing the &s;ame cour&s;e of re|&s;i&s;tance
of him, who breaks into the hou&s;e to commit mur|der,
or rape, or haime&s;ucken, or to &s;et the hou&s;e on fire.
Nor is it even nece&s;&s;ary that the felon have carried his a&s;|&s;ault
&s;o far, as clearly to &s;how which of the&s;e &s;everal fe|lonies
was in his purpo&s;e; if either he has entered the hou&s;e,
or has broke the &s;afeguard of the building, &s;o that he may
enter when he will, and is in the act, or immediate prepa|ration,
&s;o to do. Becau&s;e this is an a&s;&s;ault of &s;o bold and
deliberate a nature, and in which the invader has already
&s;o much the advantage, as warrants tho&s;e within to dread
the wor&s;t de&s;igns, and &s;uch as are not to be prevented but
by &s;uperior force; as well as that all they can do upon this
&s;udden alarm is no more than &s;ufficient to put them on an
equal footing with the felon, who comes cool and prepared
for the enterpri&s;e. Tenderne&s;s for the life of another may
indeed &s;ugge&s;t to make trial, by cries and otherwi&s;e, to de|ter
him from his purpo&s;e, before proceeding to the u&s;e of
higher means. But how commendable &s;oever this genero&s;ity
in tho&s;e who have &s;ufficient pre&s;ence of mind to employ it;
&s;till it is what the law cannot ab&s;olutely enjoin, or hold a
<PB N="329" REF="388">
per&s;on to be culpable for omitting. The main con&s;ideration
in all &s;uch ca&s;es is the alarm, &s;urpri&s;e, and danger of the
true man, who at the hour of re&s;t, and in his place of &s;ure&s;t
refuge, finds his &s;afeguard broken on a &s;udden, and his per|&s;on
within the power of a felon, who has thus a favourable
opportunity to accompli&s;h his purpo&s;e, and e&s;cape unknown.
In the&s;e circum&s;tances, he may always be &s;aid to be within
the protection of that text of the Roman law, which al|lows
the killing of the nightly thief, &startq;<HI>&s;i parcere ei &s;ine &s;uo
periculo non pote&s;t;</HI>&endq; for there is always hazard, more or
le&s;s to the inhabitant of the hou&s;e, from an a&s;&s;ault which
has already been carried this length with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>IN regard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Killing of a Hou&s;e-breaker.</NOTE> again, to tho&s;e ca&s;es, where the &s;trength and
&s;afeguard of the building are &s;till unbroken; it may rather
be e&s;teemed the duty of the inhabitant, being him&s;elf in
&s;afety at the time, to u&s;e all natural and gentler means for
&s;caring the invaders from the pro&s;ecution of their purpo&s;e.
And certainly he &s;hall not be free of blame, (&s;ome have
thought that it may even amount to murder), if, in&s;tead of
following this cour&s;e, he purpo&s;ely keep quiet for a time,
and deliberately take aim at the thieves, &s;tanding with|out,
and kill them; or if he knowingly &s;uffer them to
enter the hou&s;e, and po&s;t him&s;elf in a &s;afe and conve|nient
&s;tation, from which he kills. For in this cour&s;e of
conduct he rather &s;hows a de&s;ire of the blood of the in|dividual,
than to prevent his own injury or danger. But
it will de&s;erve a very different con&s;truction, if, in&s;tead
of taking flight upon alarm rai&s;ed within the hou&s;e, and
means u&s;ed to &s;care them, the invaders &s;hall de&s;pi&s;e the&s;e
warnings, and openly per&s;i&s;t in their purpo&s;e to force an en|try.
This would even be the mo&s;t favourable of all &s;itu|ations
<PB N="330" REF="389">
to tho&s;e within, who are thus a&s;&s;ured of the mo&s;t vio|lent
intentions, if entrance &s;hall be obtained, and mu&s;t there|fore
defend them&s;elves, by any the mo&s;t effectual means, &s;o
long as they have it in their power.</P>
<P>IN the ca&s;e of one who &s;teals in the day-time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Killing of <HI>Fur diurnus.</HI></NOTE> there are
plain and &s;ub&s;tantial rea&s;ons, why more caution &s;hould be
ob&s;erved. It was accordingly the precept of the Mo&s;aic law,
&startq;If the &s;un be ri&s;en upon him, there &s;hall blood be &s;hed
for him.&endq; The law, al&s;o, of the Romans, &s;eems only to
have permitted the killing of the <HI>fur diurnus</HI> &startq;<HI>&s;i telo &s;e de|fenderit.</HI>&endq;And in our &s;tatute 1661, c. 22. there is no &s;pecial
excu&s;e &s;et down, but of homicide committed upon thieves and
robbers, breaking hou&s;es in the night. The&s;e authorities are
however rather to be received, as applicable only to the or|dinary
ca&s;e of inva&s;ion of one's property in the day-time;
which being that the danger may be warded off without re|cour&s;e
to tho&s;e ultimate means, they are therefore forbidden
to be u&s;ed. But in this, as in every other enquiry, in cri|minal
matters, con&s;ideration mu&s;t always be had of all the
circum&s;tances of the &s;ituation. And that a per&s;on who is
a&s;&s;aulted in the open air, to be robbed, or who&s;e hou&s;e is fe|loniou&s;ly
attacked, in order to be riffled or burned, or to
commit a haime&s;ucken on him;&mdash;that he is obliged in any
ca&s;e, or at any hour, rather to &s;uffer this great wrong, which
the law puni&s;hes with death, than to hinder it, if it can no
otherwi&s;e be done, by killing the invader; or that law has
received any pre&s;umption &s;o contrary to the truth, as that
this cannot be nece&s;&s;ary again&s;t an attack in the day-time;
any of the&s;e things, it is neither rea&s;onable in it&s;elf, nor
agreeable to the analogy of the re&s;t of our practice, to be|lieve.
In &s;olitary and remote &s;ituations, where there is little
<PB N="331" REF="390">
u&s;e of pa&s;&s;age, or likelihood of relief, there may be no
other means of defending one's property. And if this were
not it&s;elf a &s;ufficient rea&s;on; how is the owner to know that
the ruffian who a&s;&s;ails in this open fa&s;hion will be con|tent
with his effects, and not endeavour, as in the day-time
he is &s;trongly tempted, to take his life too, that he may not
pro&s;ecute, or bear evidence again&s;t him?</P>
<P>THOUGH they are not &s;o probable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Killing of <HI>Fur diurnus.</HI></NOTE> yet ca&s;es may even be
imagined, to ju&s;tify the &s;laughter of the felon, though the
fir&s;t ab&s;traction was of a &s;ecret and proper theftuous nature.
Put the ca&s;e, that a per&s;on on foot, and at a di&s;tance from
any habitation or re&s;ort of pa&s;&s;age, meets a thief riding off in
all ha&s;te upon his hor&s;e, which he has &s;tolen from the field.
If he call to him to &s;top, and in&s;tead of complying, if the thief
continue the more ha&s;tily to ride away, whereby he will &s;oon
be out of the reach of the owner's pur&s;uit, or of any hue and
cry that he can rai&s;e again&s;t him, there &s;eems to be no law
which &s;hould hinder him to &s;ave his property in this nece&s;&s;ity,
though at the expence of the felon's life. &startq;<HI>Unde &s;equitur,</HI>&endq;

<P>IV.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide in Self-defence.</NOTE> HITHERTO of homicide committed in defence again&s;t
any attempt to perpetrate <HI>a felony</HI> on goods or per&s;on. But
the more ordinary &s;ituation of &s;elf-defence, is that where
the motive of the inva&s;ion is not &s;o foul, nor &s;o deliberate,
but lies in &s;ome mi&s;behaviour of one or other of the parties,
&s;ome offence of word or deed, real or conceived, which has
kindled anger on the &s;pot, and led to the mortal &s;trife.</P>
<P>NOW, with re&s;pect to all &s;laughter committed on &s;uch oc|ca&s;ions,
it is the doctrine of the law of England, grounded
in its tenderne&s;s of the life of man, that it will not hold
the &s;urviver entirely guiltle&s;s, but will rather pre&s;ume that,
which it cannot always inve&s;tigate, but which mu&s;t often
be agreeable to the truth, namely, that the &s;urviver was in
&s;ome mea&s;ure to blame, and in a greater or le&s;s degree
brought the a&s;&s;ault on him&s;elf. On conviction, therefore, of
&s;laughter <HI>&s;e defendendo,</HI> the pri&s;oner is not &s;imply acquitted,
but has &s;entence of forfeiture of moveables, again&s;t which
he has a pardon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Black&s;tone, vol. iv. p. 187. 188.</NOTE> and writ of re&s;titution of his goods, as a
matter of cour&s;e and right.</P>
<P>OUR practice again,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide in Self-defence.</NOTE> in this more lenient, but I &s;hall not
&s;ay wi&s;er than that of England, has not received any &s;uch in|variable
pre&s;umption again&s;t the &s;urviver, but inve&s;tigates
the fact in each ca&s;e as it happens; and in judging of the
pannel's plea, requires &s;uch a cour&s;e of conduct to his en|tire
acquittal, as bears earne&s;t of his peaceable di&s;po&s;ition,
and &s;incere aver&s;ion to &s;hed the blood of his fellow-creature.
That is to &s;ay, in all ca&s;es where it appears that either in the
<PB N="333" REF="392">
origin or the proge&s;s of the quarrel, or in the ultimate &s;trife,
there was any thing faulty or exce&s;&s;ive on the part of the
&s;urviver; there, for the &s;ake of correction and example, the
Judge will inflict a &s;uitable puni&s;hment on him, though it be
true that he killed out of no wickedne&s;s or malice, but only
to &s;ave his own life, and in the genuine belief that he could
not otherwi&s;e e&s;cape. This la&s;t part of the rule, be&s;ide that
it is grounded in rea&s;on and uniform cu&s;tom, is declared by
the &s;tatute 1661, c. 22. which in the ca&s;e, among others, &startq;of
homicide in lawful defence,&endq; protects the &s;layer again&s;t
the capital pain, but declares it lawful to impri&s;on him, or
to inflict a fine on him, to the u&s;e of the relict or chil|dren
of the decea&s;ed.</P>
<P>THE general de&s;cription of &s;laughter in &s;elf-defence, is,
that it is committed from nece&s;&s;ity; in the ju&s;t apprehen&s;ion,
on the part of the &s;layer, that his own life cannot otherwi&s;e
be &s;aved, and without alloy of any other le&s;s excu&s;able
motive. But this de&s;cription will require to be particularly
analyzed.</P>
<P>1. AND fir&s;t the pannel mu&s;t have killed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Killer mu&s;t be in Danger of his Life.</NOTE> <HI>to &s;ave his life.</HI> For
it will not bring him within the benefit of this plea, however
the ca&s;e may be as to others, that he killed to avoid &s;ome great
indignity, or even &s;ome bodily harm; if it be clear that this
and no more was what he had rea&s;on to fear. If, for in|&s;tance,
he kill to avoid being kicked down &s;tairs, or upon
attempt to hor&s;ewhip him, or roll him in the kennel, he can|not
be fully ju&s;tified: becau&s;e, how painful &s;oever &s;uch in|juries
to the feelings both of mind and body, they &s;till are
not mortal operations, nor attended with any immediate
danger of death; &s;o that they amount only to a plea of great
provocation, which will not in any ca&s;e completely exculpate.

<P>AS appears from this ca&s;e of Hardie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Killer mu&s;t be in Danger of his Life.</NOTE> it will not even be
&s;ufficient that the injury is of that kind, which by long con|tinuance
may come to kill, or do a mi&s;chief from which
death may en&s;ue. The a&s;&s;ault mu&s;t already have continued
&s;o long at the time of killing, and have been conducted
in &s;uch a manner, as puts the &s;ufferer in imminent and
pre&s;ent danger of his life, and &s;hews the a&s;&s;ailant's pur|po&s;e,
not to be &s;atisfied with le&s;s than his de&s;truction. One,
for in&s;tance, who is carried to the river and ducked, may
by this abu&s;e contract a fever, which may prove mortal; or
the operation may be &s;o often repeated, or &s;o unmercifully
conducted, as to de&s;troy the per&s;on on the &s;pot. Yet neither
of the&s;e hazards will ju&s;tify him in repelling the outrage
with death in the beginning. In like manner, a &s;chool-boy
may die of the con&s;equences of exce&s;&s;ive correction; or he
may be &s;o cruelly &s;courged as to expire under the ma&s;ter's
hands. Yet if he draw a knife and &s;tab the ma&s;ter on the

liable to puni&s;hment; or it may be that he is even guilty of
<PB N="336" REF="395">
murder. Matters, in &s;hort, mu&s;t have come to the &s;ituation
<HI>morti proximum,</HI> in which the &s;ufferer has a rea&s;onable and
in&s;tant dread of death, before he can ju&s;tifiably &s;hed the
blood of the aggre&s;&s;or, to put an end to the a&s;&s;ault. In this
view it probably was, that in the interlocutor upon the ca&s;e
of David Pretis,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 19. &amp; 26. 1730.</NOTE> the Court made u&s;e of very &s;pecial terms,
and &s;uch as are exclu&s;ive of any lower danger than has now
been de&s;cribed. He pleaded, that the decca&s;ed had a&s;&s;ault|ed
him in his own hou&s;e; had dragged him from thence,
cut him in the head with &s;ome &s;harp in&s;trument, and beaten
him to the ground. But in&s;tead of adopting the&s;e allega|tions,
the Court had thought it &s;afer to find in general thus:
&startq;But for eliding the fore&s;aid relevancy, &s;u&s;tain this de|fence
to the pannel, <HI>viz.</HI> that his wounding of the defunct
was in &s;elf-defence, while the pannel was by the defunct's

<P>IT is not &s;ufficient that the pannel have killed out of ap|prehen&s;ion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fal&s;e Opinion of Danger not &s;uf|ficient.</NOTE>
though in him ever &s;o genuine, of danger to his
life, if it was not al&s;o a rea&s;onable apprehen&s;ion, and well
grounded in the circum&s;tances of the &s;ituation. In a matter
of this kind, the law cannot entirely pardon any vain terror
or &s;udden panic; for again&s;t this, &s;o far at lea&s;t as concerns
his conduct towards others, it is the duty of every man to be
on his guard. Neither can it have con&s;ideration to that extent,
of an exce&s;&s;ive timidity of temper, (which is a blameable ha|bit
and ought to be corrected), nor of any gro&s;s mi&s;apprehen|&s;ion
of the nature of the a&s;&s;ault; becau&s;e it will always be
&s;uppo&s;ed that by due caution and attention &s;uch misfortunes

is not done on any real danger of the pannel's life, but
on a fal&s;e and ha&s;ty opinion only to that effect.</P>

a thruft at James, happens to fall, and the &s;word flies
out of his hand in the fall, and is broken; or if James, at
this time, by a lucky hit di&s;arms John, who&s;e &s;word is
to&s;&s;ed to a di&s;tance; and if in&s;tead of u&s;ing this opportu|nity
to e&s;cape, or to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of John's &s;word,
James &s;hall follow up the accident with repeated thru&s;ts at
John, thus di&s;armed, and kill him; he has at lea&s;t lo&s;t his
preten&s;ions to the plea of &s;elf-defence, however the ca&s;e may
&s;tand as to any other. Or &s;uppo&s;e that James, being put to
the wall, has thru&s;t and wounded: if upon this John retires,
and James advances on him; and John retires &s;till farther, and
James continues to advance thru&s;ting at him, and at la&s;t kills;
here al&s;o he cannot be ju&s;tified. The ca&s;e of Edward Da|vies,
as it turned out on proof, &s;eems to have been of this
de&s;cription; though I cannot for certain affirm whether it
was judged on this or on another ground. Davies, a &s;oldier,
was charged with the &s;laughter of Robert Park,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 8. &amp; 18. 1712.</NOTE> a country|man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 1713.</NOTE>
by running him through the body with a &s;word, from
back to brea&s;t. He pleaded, that the decea&s;ed, and three more,
provided with &s;taves, had attacked and beaten him in the
&s;treet; that he retired, and they pre&s;&s;ed on him, and cut
him &s;everely in the hand; whereupon he called for the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance
<PB N="339" REF="398">
of the guard, which was near at hand, and drew and
made u&s;e of his &s;word. The reply was to this effect: that
any danger he had ever been in was pa&s;t, &s;ince the guard
were coming up to his relief, and the aggre&s;&s;ors were re|tiring
at the time; and that in particular this was the ca&s;e
with the decea&s;ed, as appeared from his being wounded by
the pannel in the back. Either on this footing, or on that
of high provocation, and that the pannel had never been
truly in danger of his life&endq; the defence was found only re|levant
to re&s;trict the libel to an arbitrary puni&s;hment<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">December 18. 1712. &startq;The Lords find the pannel, his giving the defunct, the time and place libelled, the mortal wound with a &s;word, whereof he died, relevant to infer the pains libelled; and find the pannel, his being alone the time and place fore&s;aid, and a &s;cuffle then happening betwixt the defunct, with two or three more in his company, and the pannel, and after a beating with &s;taves betwixt the &s;aid men and the pannel, the &s;aid pannel, his retiring and calling for the guard, and being mutilated in the hand before he gave the &s;aid mortal wound, a defence relevant to re&s;trict the &s;aid libel to an arbitrary pu|ni&s;hment.&endq; The jury, Jan. 26. 1713, found, That there was proof of the &s;laughter, and none of the decea&s;ed having been in the &s;cuffle.

<P>2. THE &s;elf-defence mu&s;t not only be genuine in this &s;en&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Not Self de|fence, if Killer can e&s;cape other|wise.</NOTE>
that the killer is a&s;&s;aulted to the danger of his life, but it
mu&s;t be ju&s;t and <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> al&s;o; the one refuge which the
killer has from this high peril of his per&s;on. That is to &s;ay,
the plea will not be good in tho&s;e, not unfrequent &s;ituations,
where the pannel has other ways of e&s;cape from the a&s;&s;ault,
or the certain and ea&s;y means of putting an end to it, but
out of pride, or humour, or &s;ome fal&s;e notion of di&s;honour
in the thing, choo&s;es rather to &s;tand and repel the violence,
than have recour&s;e to them. One for in&s;tance, who is a&s;|&s;aulted
at mid-day, on the &s;treet, where he may ea&s;ily re|tire,
<PB N="340" REF="399">
and find &s;helter among the by&s;tanders, or otherwi&s;e; if
in&s;tead of doing &s;o, he deliberately wait to receive the on|&s;et,
and will not give back; he cannot allege that he kills
purely to &s;ave his life: he kills to indulge his temper, or
for the &s;ake of his opinion, which, in the e&s;timation of the
law, is a fal&s;e and a wrong opinion, and one which he mu&s;t
be taught to abjure in time to come. I may here quote the
words of the interlocutor on the libel again&s;t Captain James
Bruce and others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 1. &amp; 2. 1691.</NOTE> indicted for the murder of Simp&s;on and
Linklatur, two &s;oldiers of the city-guard of Edinburgh.
They pleaded, that they were violently a&s;&s;aulted by the
guard, when drinking the King's health at a bonefire on the
&s;treet. But this defence, the Court repelled &startq;unle&s;s the
pannels prove, that before the killing of Henry Linkla|tur,
they were (by the guard's aggre&s;&s;ing them), put in
pre&s;ent danger of their lives, <HI>and could not otherwi&s;e e&s;cape.</HI>&endq;
In the ca&s;e al&s;o of John Macmillan,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 24. 1690.</NOTE> where the a&s;&s;ault was
alleged to have been made in the like &s;ituation, one of
the circum&s;tances which the jury find, and on which the
Court proceed to give &s;entence of death is this, &startq;that he
might with ea&s;e have made his e&s;cape, &s;o as to &s;ave his
life without drawing his &s;word.&endq; On the &s;ame prin|ciple,
one who will &s;tand a mortal a&s;&s;ault, rather than ren|der
him&s;elf to the officers of ju&s;tice, becau&s;e he is innocent
of the matter that is laid to his charge, or becau&s;e they mi&s;|take
him for another man, (which error he ob&s;erves, and
fullenly declines to explain), is, by this vice of temper, or
un&s;oundne&s;s of head, reduced to a far more difficult and
more unfavourable plea than &s;elf-defence. The&s;e are things
in which it is his duty to comply. He ought to yield though
he be innocent; and he deals mo&s;t unfairly, and even cruel|ly
with the officer of ju&s;tice, not to inform him of his mi&s;take.
<PB N="341" REF="400">
It would be ea&s;y to put many other ca&s;es of a like nature, in
which, though the &s;urviver is not the fir&s;t to a&s;&s;ault, yet he
kills out of a nece&s;&s;ity (if it may be called &s;o), which is oc|ca&s;ioned
by his own will, and choice of a cour&s;e of conduct.
I &s;hall only farther explain this matter, (if I may be allowed
to u&s;e &s;o familiar an illu&s;tration), by what is related, (and I
believe is true), of &s;ome noted &s;word's-man, who laid claim
to the &s;ole privilege of walking upon certain boards of the
floor of the coffee-room which he frequented. This pre|ten&s;ion
had long been &s;ubmitted to; but was at la&s;t wittingly
and deliberately di&s;puted, by a gentleman, who fought with
this u&s;urper on the &s;pot, and killed him on his own do|maine.
Certainly, it cannot be thought that the place &s;uffer|ed
a great injury in the lo&s;s of &s;uch a member of &s;ociety.
Yet, in a trial for the homicide, this champion of the pub|lic
right could hardly have had the benefit of the plea of
&s;elf-defence. For, in &s;ub&s;tance, the ca&s;e was much the &s;ame
as if he had appointed to meet his antagoni&s;t in that place,
and to fight purely for po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;pot. In &s;hort, in all
ca&s;es of this de&s;cription, the &s;urviver &s;hows nothing of that a|ver&s;ion
to &s;hed the blood of his neighbour, which is a nece&s;&s;a|ry
ingredient of the plea of &s;elf-defence; but rather a &s;ort of
quarrel&s;ome ob&s;tinacy, which courts and invites the a&s;&s;ault.</P>
<P>3. TO have the benefit of a full and entire ju&s;tification,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Moderamen in culpatae Tutelae;</HI> what it is.</NOTE>
the pannel mu&s;t have ob&s;erved the due temperance and re|&s;erve,
(<HI>moderamen in culpatae tutelae,</HI> as it is termed by lawyers),
in conducting his defence. The meaning of which is, that
with re&s;pect to the weapons employed, the &s;ea&s;on and the
way of u&s;ing them, and in all other particulars, he mu&s;t have
confined him&s;elf to that ju&s;t degree and mea&s;ure which were
requi&s;ite towards his own &s;afety, and have done what in
<PB N="342" REF="401">
him lay to take him&s;elf out of the &s;trife, without &s;hedding
the blood of the invader. For if in any of the&s;e points
there have been exce&s;s or precipitation on his part, &s;ome
reprehen&s;ion proportioned to the error will attend it; true
though it be that he was in danger of his life at the time of
killing, and &s;truck the mortal blow for his own protection,
and not out of any malice or revenge. Thus with re&s;pect to
weapons. One is &s;uddenly invaded and beaten with a club,
poker, or the like dangerous weapon, by a per&s;on of &s;upe|rior
&s;trength, and in a chamber from which he cannot rea|dily
e&s;cape; and in this &s;ituation, to &s;ave his life, he draws
his &s;word and kills. It is however proved, that he might
have found in the apartment the like weapon to that with
which he was attacked; or that by cool and &s;kilful manage|ment
of his &s;word, he might have made good his retreat
from the chamber, without &s;acrificing the aggre&s;&s;or's life.
That he has done otherwi&s;e, may, and, with the aid of the
proper circum&s;tances in evidence, will be pre&s;umed, to have
been owing to the alarm and trepidation which are natural
on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, and not to any cruel or malignant pur|po&s;e.
But though this di&s;order of &s;pirits be &s;u&s;tained as
an excu&s;e to him; &s;till it is in &s;ome mea&s;ure a blemi&s;h in
his conduct, and deprives him of the benefit of an ab&s;olute
and entire ju&s;tification.</P>
<P>IT is in this &s;en&s;e that we are to under&s;tand the interlocutor
in the ca&s;e of John Govan,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Exce&s;&s;us Mode|raminis.</HI> Feb. 20. and Mar. 3. 1710.</NOTE> which finds the pannel liable to an
arbitrary puni&s;hment, at the &s;ame time that it implies him to
have been in danger of his life. &startq;They find the libel relevant
to infer the pains of death; and &s;u&s;tain the defences propo|ned
for the pannel in the&s;e terms, <HI>viz.</HI> that the pannel was
attacked by the defunct and his a&s;&s;ociate with opprobrious
<PB N="343" REF="402">
words, and beating of him, &s;o that he was nece&s;&s;itat to fly
and betake him&s;elf to his hou&s;e, and the defunct with his
a&s;&s;ociate returning and invading the pannel in his hou&s;e,
and there renewed the &s;cuffle by beating of him, and the
pannel, <HI>in dread and fear,</HI> laid hold on a &s;word for his
defence, endeavoured to repel the violence, and force
them out of his hou&s;e, and that during the continuance of
this &s;cuffle, the pannel gave the defunct the deadly wound,
either in the hou&s;e, at the door of the hou&s;e, or before
the door, relevant to re&s;trict the libel to an arbitrary pu|ni&s;hment.&endq;
Probably, this is al&s;o the ju&s;t con&s;truction of
the interlocutor in the ca&s;e of John Macmillan.<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 24. 1690.</NOTE> Macmil|lan
had killed Grier&s;on, by &s;tabbing him in the belly with a
&s;word. He &s;tated in defence, that Grier&s;on had &s;et upon and
beaten him with a great &s;taff, to the danger of his life, which
obliged him to draw his &s;word; and that Grier&s;on's &s;ervant
then laid hold of and &s;topped him, till Grier&s;on &s;truck him
&s;everal violent blows more. The interlocutor was thus:
&startq;And as to the qualification of &s;elf-defence, find that de|fence,
that the pannel was a&s;&s;aulted and beaten by the de|funct,
with &s;uch a great batton or rung, as might have
brained or killed him, and could not get fled, nor &s;ave his
life otherwi&s;e, <HI>than by drawing his &s;word,</HI> after he was &s;o
a&s;&s;aulted, relevant to liberate the pannel from capital pu|ni&s;hment,
but prejudice of inflicting an arbitrary pain,
as accords.&endq; Now the words of this judgment are to
be attended to. If they had been, that the pannel could not
&s;ave his life <HI>without &s;tabbing the decea&s;ed,</HI> certainly the judg|ment
would have been unju&s;t in &s;ubjecting him to any
puni&s;hment at all. But the hypothetical &s;tate of facts,
to which the interlocutor applies an arbitrary puni&s;hment,
is only this, that he could not e&s;cape <HI>without drawing his
<PB N="344" REF="403">
&s;word;</HI> which leaves the ca&s;e open to this con&s;truction, that
by the due management of that weapon, again&s;t a per&s;on at|tacking
with a &s;taff, he might have &s;ecured his retreat, with|out
&s;triking a mortal blow.</P>
<P>THERE is likewi&s;e exce&s;s in the <HI>degree</HI> of the violence by
which the pannel has warded off the danger of his life; if
out of extreme fear and agitation, he has continued it long|er,
or has done more, than was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;|able
the invader.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 9. 1685.</NOTE> In the trial of Urquhart and Web&s;ter for
the &s;laughter of Simp&s;on, it was urged in behalf of Web&s;ter,
(for Urquhart was alleged to have had no concern in the
violence), that the decea&s;ed had brui&s;ed him with a large &s;taff
or baton, thrown him to the ground, and trodden upon him
to the danger of his life. In reply, the pro&s;ecutor allowed
the relevancy of this plea, but ob&s;erved, that there was at
lea&s;t an <HI>exce&s;&s;us moderaminis</HI> on the part of Web&s;ter; as he
had brought Simp&s;on to the ground with a blow of a &s;taff,
and had afterwards &s;o brui&s;ed and abu&s;ed him, as to break his
ribs, and occa&s;ion death. The Court find the libel relevant
to infer the pain of death; &startq;&s;u&s;tain the an&s;wer of &s;elf-de|fence
relevant to elide the dittay; and find the reply of ex|ce&s;s
relevant to take off the defence.&endq; An ambiguous ver|dict
was returned; and the i&s;&s;ue was, that in terms of the &s;ta|tute
1661, both pannels were decreed in a certain &s;um to the
relict and children of the decea&s;ed, and were ordered to
goal, during the plea&s;ure of the Court.</P>
<P>AGAIN as to time.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Exce&s;&s;us Mode|raminis</HI> as to time.</NOTE> If John is in the act of drawing his
&s;word on James, and James ru&s;h in upon and kill him be|fore
it be fully drawn, there is here al&s;o a precipitation and
exce&s;s, for which the killer &s;hall be an&s;werable to the law.
Yet it may neverthele&s;s be a ju&s;t ca&s;e of &s;elf-defence. For
<PB N="345" REF="404">
let it be &s;uppo&s;ed that the decea&s;ed was a noted &s;word&s;man,
and of &s;uperior &s;trength to James, and a man too of a known
cruel temper, and that he had po&s;ted him&s;elf by the door of
the chamber, &s;o as to hinder James from e&s;caping; certainly
James was in plain jeopardy, and had good rea&s;on to dread
the wor&s;t. Yet, as there is an apparent precipitation on his
part; a departure, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, from that &s;trict and &s;cru|pulous
caution, which the law would recommend and en|join
in &s;o intere&s;ting a particular; he cannot be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed
entirely free of cen&s;ure or rebuke. In another &s;en&s;e, any
exce&s;s in the article of time, &s;eems to be &s;carcely recon|cileable
to the ju&s;t notion of &s;elf-defence. This is, where
the &s;laughter is not in&s;tant upon the attack or danger, but
at &s;ome interval of time. For in this &s;ituation, at lea&s;t if
the interval is of any length, the deed can only be at|tributed
to the principle of revenge; which always makes a
ca&s;e of murder. With this in &s;ome mea&s;ure coincides the
exce&s;s in point of place; which is, if the pannel beat off
the a&s;&s;ailant, and pur&s;ue him any con&s;iderable way in his
retreat. In either of the&s;e &s;ituations it is not an <HI>exce&s;&s;us
inculpatae defen&s;ionis,</HI> or nimious violence in defending, but an
<HI>exce&s;&s;us defen&s;ionis</HI> &s;imply; an act of aggre&s;&s;ion, and an entire
departure from the defen&s;ive line of conduct.</P>
<P>TOUCHING the&s;e &s;everal modes of exce&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Limitation of the <HI>moderamen tute|lae.</HI></NOTE> it would be a vain
attempt, (though not untried by the Civilians), to reduce
them, and the different po&s;&s;ible combinations of them, under
a few general and invariable rules. By the very nature of
every &s;uch que&s;tion, it is a que&s;tion for the con&s;ideration
of the jury, and which mu&s;t be re&s;olved on a complex
view of the whole ca&s;e; wherein regard is had not of
this or 'tother article only, which <HI>prima facie,</HI> or gene|rally
<PB N="346" REF="405">
&s;peaking, may be accounted unfavourable to the pan|nel,
but of all and what&s;oever tho&s;e circum&s;tances of the
&s;ituation, which may rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed to have affect|ed
him at the time. And one con&s;ideration there is on
his part, which ought always to be duly weighed; as in|deed,
unle&s;s this be done, the foregoing rules would circum|&s;cribe
his plea within too narrow bounds. I mean the dan|ger
to him&s;elf, from too great tenderne&s;s to the invader,
or an exce&s;&s;ive backwardne&s;s in defence; the effect of
which may be, that he lo&s;es the proper &s;ea&s;on of defending
him&s;elf to advantage, or with effect. Thus, though it be a
point of duty to retire from the a&s;&s;ault; yet this is always
to be received under provi&s;ion that the a&s;&s;ault be not &s;o hot,
as makes it difficult to retire, and &s;o that in retiring the
per&s;on do not materially encrea&s;e his own danger, or put
him&s;elf to a plain di&s;advantage for conducting his defence:
As if he have to retire down a dark or &s;teep &s;tair-ca&s;e, or
by pa&s;&s;ages better known to the invader than to him. On
the &s;ame ground it cannot be exacted of him, to wait till the
pi&s;tol is in the very act of being fired at him; or if the
enemy have drawn, and be ru&s;hing towards him, he may
meet him with his fire, before the point be at his brea&s;t.
This &s;eems to be allowed by the judgment in the ca&s;e of
Captain William Barclay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 12. 1668.</NOTE> of which Mackenzie gives &s;ome,
but rather an incorrect account. The interlocutor is in
the&s;e words: &startq;The Ju&s;tices repels the haill defences and
qualifications proponit for the pannells in re&s;pect of the
reply; and finds that the qualification of &s;elf-defence is
relevant in this ca&s;e, that the defunct Sinclair or his ac|complices
were the fir&s;t aggre&s;&s;ors, without any ju&s;t pro|vocation
given by him, and that he woundit the pan|nell's
<PB N="347" REF="406">
brother or &s;ervants, and thereafter <HI>pur&s;ued the pan|nell
with a drawn &s;word or bended pi&s;tol.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>IN like manner, it is generally true that one is not to u&s;e
a mortal weapon again&s;t that which is not mortal. Yet this
al&s;o has its exceptions. If two per&s;ons &s;et upon one and
invade him, the one with a &s;word, and the other with a
&s;taff, which the latter u&s;es to di&s;concert him in his defence,
&s;o that he may be laid open to the a&s;&s;ault of the former; is
it to be doubted that the ordinary rule of mea&s;uring wea|pon
again&s;t weapon is &s;et a&s;ide, and that he has right with
any weapon, or in any the mo&s;t &s;peedy way, to di&s;patch this
ba&s;e and in&s;idious a&s;&s;i&s;tant?</P>
<P>4. EVEN when all the&s;e con&s;iderations unite in &s;up|port
of the pannel's plea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What if the Killer occa&s;ioned the A&s;&s;ault.</NOTE> as relative to the moment of killing,
they may however be accompanied with one circum&s;tance
more, which &s;hall hinder them to work his ab&s;olute ju&s;cifi|cation
and acquittal. This is, if in any degree the pannel
has him&s;elf been the cau&s;e of the fatal &s;trife. John and
James deliberately appoint to fight with mortal weapons;
and in the cour&s;e of the combat James is wounded and re|tires,
and calls to John to de&s;i&s;t; which John refu&s;es, and
follows up his advantage &s;o hotly, that James, purely to &s;ave
his life, is at la&s;t con&s;trained to kill. If, as &s;eems more pro|bable,
this is not even a ca&s;e of murder, at lea&s;t it gives no
room for the proper plea of &s;elf-defence; becau&s;e the dan|ger
and nece&s;&s;ity are the act of John him&s;elf; are the re&s;ult
of a &s;ituation, which he has deliberately courted. In the
ca&s;e of Robert Robert&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Self-defence in ca&s;es of Duel. Aug. 4. 1673.</NOTE> it was even judged to be murder
in the &s;urviver, notwith&s;tanding the more favourable plea,
that on <HI>coming to the field</HI> he earne&s;tly declined the com|bat<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">&startq;So that <HI>e&s;to argumenti cau&s;a,</HI> he had gone to the craigs with him, yet ha|ving repented him on the place, it was lawful for him to have re&s;iled; like|as, <HI>de facto,</HI> he did re&s;ile and refu&s;ed to fight; but being forced thereto by the defunct, it was nece&s;&s;ary for him in his own defence to draw his &s;word.&endq;</NOTE>,

the decea&s;ed; &s;o that he had no choice, but was nece&s;&s;itated
to defend his life: And of the&s;e things he offered proof.

was di&s;regarded; and the libel alone was remitted to

previou&s;ly intruded into George Poi&s;et's chamber, where
he was in bed, and had abu&s;ed his per&s;on; and that after
being turned out, they had again alarmed and di&s;turbed him,

he had him&s;elf been the immediate author of the com|bat,

having ri&s;en from the table where he was writing,
and having cro&s;&s;ed the room, and pulled the decea&s;ed by the
no&s;e.</P>
<P>THERE does not even &s;eem to be any good rea&s;on, why he
&s;hould not be liable to the moderate correction of fine and
impri&s;onment, appointed by the &s;tatute 1661, who brings the
a&s;&s;ault on him&s;elf, by the provocation of contumelious words,
or deri&s;ive &s;igns and ge&s;tures. However blameable &s;o ardent
a temper in the decea&s;ed, and though it would have been
murder in him, if, in revenge of the taunt, he had in&s;tantly
killed the reviler; yet, as the event has happened, this per|&s;on
cannot be held free of blame, who knowing that temper,
applied &s;uch incentives to it, or if he knew it not, was
<PB N="352" REF="411">
ra&s;h enough to make &s;o dangerous a trial of what it might
prove to be. Though his words were not a provocation to
ju&s;tify, or even to excu&s;e the killing of him, and make it le&s;s
than a capital crime; it does not follow that they are there|fore
no wrong at all, and in&s;ufficient even as a ground of
cen&s;ure on the &s;peaker, being him&s;elf the &s;urviver, and the
&s;layer of the very per&s;on, to who&s;e re&s;entment (within
certain bounds), his in&s;olence had ju&s;tly expo&s;ed him. If
the law of England, without enquiry, pre&s;umes a wrong in
the &s;urviver, in every quarrel which i&s;&s;ues in homicide <HI>&s;e
defendendo,</HI> we certainly will go the length of attending to
any actual, though but verbal wrong, that is proved again&s;t
him.</P>
<P>I HERE conclude my enquiry concerning homicide in &s;elf|defence,
the la&s;t &s;pecies of that homicide, which is termed
ju&s;tifiable, and does not expo&s;e to any &s;ort of correction.
In explaining it, I have nece&s;&s;arily introduced &s;ome in&s;tan|ces
of another &s;ort of homicide, of which we are next to
treat, namely, culpable homicide, which implies blame in
the killer, and is followed with puni&s;hment, more or le&s;s
con&s;iderable, according to the quality of the fault.</P>
<P>V. CULPABLE HOMICIDE appears to be of &s;everal kinds
and degrees; which are grounded in different rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>1. IT has been &s;aid, and does not &s;tand in need of farther
illu&s;tration, that it is culpable homicide, where &s;laughter
follows in the doing even of a lawful act; if it be done without
the due caution and circum&s;pection for preventing injury to
others.</P>
<P><PB N="353" REF="412">
2. IT has al&s;o been &s;aid, that it falls under the &s;ame
con&s;ideration, if death en&s;ue on the doing of an unlawful
and prohibited thing; &s;uch as the di&s;charging of fire-arms,
or the throwing of &s;tones or fire-works in the &s;treets of a ci|ty,
or the whipping of a hor&s;e there, &s;o that it &s;prings for|ward,
and kills a pa&s;&s;enger.</P>
<P>3. A THIRD ca&s;e of culpable homicide,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Culpable Homi|cide by Mi&s;ad|venture.</NOTE> al&s;o incidentally
taken notice of, and which may &s;ometimes &s;tand higher in
the &s;cale of guilt than either of the others, is where death
en&s;ues by mi&s;adventure, without the intention of the killer,
and in an unfor&s;een and unlikely manner; but withal on a
purpo&s;e to do &s;ome &s;ort of bodily harm to the decea&s;ed.
If John and James, per&s;ons of equal years and &s;trength,
happen to quarrel, and John &s;trike James a &s;ingle blow
with the hand, which unhappily kills him; or if John
thru&s;t James a&s;ide, and James &s;lipping a foot fall to the
ground, and have his &s;kull fractured, and in con&s;equence
die; in either of the&s;e ca&s;es the death is an extraordinary
ca&s;ualty, &s;uch as no one who &s;trikes in that fa&s;hion can
fairly be pre&s;umed to have intended, or to have thought
of as a probable or even po&s;&s;ible event. Yet as John is
blameable, in that he u&s;es any manner of violence to the
per&s;on of his neighbour, and would be liable to &s;ome cen&s;ure
even on that account, if nothing more happened; and as
his neighbour has actually died of this violence; &s;o, for the
&s;ake of example, and the &s;atisfaction of the public, as well
as of the relations of the decea&s;ed, he &s;hall, within cer|tain
bounds, be an&s;werable for the mortal con&s;equence,
which it will here, without much enquiry, be pre&s;umed
that nothing but great indi&s;cretion on his part could oc|ca&s;ion.</P>

the wound, of it&s;elf, was not of a mortal nature; all
which, as well as the libel, were &s;ent to the a&s;&s;ize. But the
Court were of opinion, that even as laid in the libel, the
charge was not of that nature, which implied either a

pur&s;ued and chaced by him and his &s;aid &s;on John, with
&s;ticks or &s;taves, or other mortal and offen&s;ive weapons, on
hor&s;eback, and wounded to the great effu&s;ion of his blood,
and obliged by force and violence, or terror and fear of
their cruelty, to run into the water of Nith; which with
the violence of the &s;tream carried him down, &s;o that at
&s;ome di&s;tance he was found dead.&endq; Now here was a
plain abu&s;e of Ru&s;&s;ell's per&s;on, which i&s;&s;ued in his death.
And yet, as related in the libel, the a&s;&s;ault could hardly be
&s;aid to ju&s;tify a charge of murder; &s;ince Ru&s;&s;ell rather ap|peared
out of exce&s;&s;ive fear and terror to have thrown him|&s;elf
into the &s;tream, than to have been under any nece&s;&s;ity of
doing &s;o, to &s;ave his life. At lea&s;t this was the view in which
the matter had occurred to the Court. For though they
found a capital relevancy on the general and concluding
charge, that at the time and place libelled the decea&s;ed was
murdered, and that the pannel was art and part thereof; yet
with re&s;pect to the above facts related in the libel, they were
of a different opinion, and found as follows. &startq;<HI>Separatim</HI>

chace to the defunct with &s;ticks or &s;laves, and thereby

It appears that the &s;tairs were winding, or (as they are pro|vincially

eight &s;teps at the foot, &s;o that his head lay out at the thre&s;h|old.
On the whole circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, as &s;hown in

pannel was criminal in pu&s;hing or &s;triking the decea&s;ed in
&s;o hazardous a &s;ituation, yet he could not be held to have been
actuated by a mortal purpo&s;e. They therefore found the libel

him), will not determine his guilt; for clear it is,
(which often amounts to the &s;ame in law) that he meant to
do him a dangerous, exce&s;&s;ive, and outrageous bodily harm,
and commited &s;uch flagrant abu&s;e of his per&s;on, as &s;howed
an ab&s;olute and complete indifference about him, whether
he &s;hould live or die.</P>
<P>I SHALL now di&s;mi&s;s this article,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is the <HI>animus occidendi</HI> pre&s;u|med in &s;uch Ca&s;es.</NOTE> after ob&s;erving, with
re&s;pect to the pre&s;umption on the &s;ubject, whether it be that
the pannel meant death, or &s;ome great mi&s;chief, or only
&s;ome inferior injury, that no general rule can be laid down,
which &s;hall be very &s;erviceable in practice, or &s;hall not be
liable to frequent exceptions. It may &s;eem rea&s;onable, in
the ca&s;e of a blow or two &s;truck with the hand, or with &s;ome
ordinary and &s;eemingly harmle&s;s implement, that the pre|&s;umption
&s;hall be in favour of the pannel, that he was not
actuated by a very injurious purpo&s;e. But even this is only
generally true, and entirely fails in the ca&s;e of a &s;tout and
<PB N="360" REF="419">
grown man, who &s;mites a woman, or a boy, or an infant, or
an aged and very infirm per&s;on, in that manner, and with
all his might; a mode of a&s;&s;ault as likely to prove mortal
to &s;uch a one, as in the ca&s;e of one of his own years it is, if
he &s;trike him with a &s;tone or a club. Nay, the very words
uttered by the pannel on the occa&s;ion, if they be very ma|lignant
and rancorous, and more e&s;pecially if there have
been waylaying of the decea&s;ed, and previous threats of
de&s;truction, may be expo&s;itive of the intent in &s;uch a man|ner,
as to maintain the pro&s;ecution for murder, though com|mitted
with a very unlikely weapon. Accordingly, dittay
was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 29. 1664.</NOTE> without he&s;itation, &s;u&s;tained again&s;t Malcolm Brown,
miller in Lenox-mill, for killing William Stark, a young
boy, by &s;triking him a blow on the ear with the hand; where|by
he became in&s;tantly deaf, and langui&s;hed for &s;ome time,
and died. The pannel maintained only this defence, that
the boy died of &s;ome other ailment; and on this ground it
probably was, that he had a verdict of acquittal.</P>
<P>THERE is thus no ju&s;t and general rule but one, that the
intent mu&s;t be gathered from the whole circum&s;tances of the
ca&s;e; by the Court, when judging of the relevancy, accord|ing
as the &s;tory is related in the libel, which at that period is
held for true; and by the jury, according as the fact ap|pears
upon the evidence. With re&s;pect to which, even
though the pannel bring no proof in exculpation, &s;uch <HI>indi|cia</HI>
(or <HI>tokens</HI> as they were once called) may appear on the
pro&s;ecutor's proof, as &s;hall ju&s;tify the jury in acquitting of
the higher offence.</P>
<P>4. I NOW pa&s;s from tho&s;e ca&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Culpable Homi|cide on Provo|cation.</NOTE> where the homicide is in
this &s;en&s;e accidental, that it happens without the intention
of the killer, to tho&s;e, certainly more criminal ca&s;es, where
<PB N="361" REF="420">
the killer has a mortal purpo&s;e, and yet is not in the fir&s;t
degree of guilt as a murderer: for this rea&s;on, that he is
not &s;tirred to the deed by wickedne&s;s of heart, or hatred of
the decea&s;ed, but by the &s;udden impul&s;e of re&s;entment, ex|cited
by the provocation of high and real injuries, and ac|companied
with terror and agitation of &s;pirits.</P>
<P>TO judge &s;uch a &s;laughter as a pure involuntary act,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grounds there|of.</NOTE> like
that of a brute or a madman, which is the object of nei|ther
prai&s;e nor blame; this certainly is a cour&s;e for which
nothing of any weight can be urged. For although, along
with other animals, we are &s;ubject to the impul&s;e of re&s;ent|ment
on injuries, which is nece&s;&s;ary to our pre&s;ervation;
yet it is not in our &s;pecies, as in theirs, a blind and ungo|vernable
impul&s;e, which tran&s;ports us whither&s;oever it will;
but has been placed by the Author of our nature, under
the controul of a &s;uperior principle, which may &s;erve to re|&s;train
it within tho&s;e ju&s;t bounds, where it an&s;wers its pro|per
ends; and by means of which, if duly and habitually
exerted, not only the conduct of the man on any particular
occa&s;ion may be regulated, but even the feeling it&s;elf be in
a great mea&s;ure cha&s;tened and &s;ubdued: &s;o that the very
things which are done for &s;elf-defence, &s;hall be done calmly
and with mea&s;ure, and le&s;s out of rage or animal pa&s;&s;ion, than
from con&s;iderations of ju&s;tice and nece&s;&s;ity. To gain this
&s;tate of &s;elf-command, is part of every man's duty, according
to the degree that is attainable to him, in his way of edu|cation
and cour&s;e of life; and &s;o far to fall &s;hort of it,
as mortally to avenge any in&s;ult or injury which neither
is attended with danger to one's life, nor is impo&s;&s;ible to be
repelled and cha&s;ti&s;ed by gentler means,&mdash;this, without a
doubt, is a culpable and criminal exce&s;s, &s;uch as in any well
<PB N="363" REF="421">
con&s;tituted mind will be followed with long regret, and
which the magi&s;trate cannot pa&s;s over without &s;evere re|prehen&s;ion.
A conclu&s;ion which will only be the more con|firmed,
when he reflects on the great frequency of &s;uch
&s;cenes of provocation, and how prone the nature of every
man to judge too ha&s;tily, and too highly, of any wrong
which he happens to &s;u&s;tain. To put men therefore on
their guard in this re&s;pect, and form them, as much as may
be, to a previous habit and di&s;po&s;ition on the &s;ubject, which
may &s;erve as a corrective of &s;udden pa&s;&s;ion, the law of all
civilized countries, has condemned all homicide that is
done on provocation, though grievous, and difficult to be
with&s;tood, as a high crime, and the fit &s;ubject of exemplary
correction.</P>
<P>BUT while we thus entertain a well grounded jealou&s;y of
every man's partiality in his own ca&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grounds of culpable Homi|cide on Provo|cation.</NOTE> and have a due regard
to the peace and order of &s;ociety, which are &s;o deeply con|cerned
in the repre&s;&s;ing of &s;uch exce&s;&s;es; yet, on the other
&s;ide, we cannot as men be in&s;en&s;ible to the wide difference in
re&s;pect of guilt, between the homicide which has no cau&s;e but
in the wickedne&s;s of the killer, and that which is only in re|taliation
of &s;ore and alarming injuries received upon the
&s;pot, and has thus the double excu&s;e of bodily pain, and
perturbation of &s;pirits.</P>
<P>IT may indeed be &s;aid, that in one point of view, there
is more need of &s;everity applied to &s;udden than to wilful and
malicious homicide; on account of the greater frequency
of the inferior offence. But no more in this than in other
ca&s;es, can we, in judging between man and man, put the feel|ings
of human nature out of que&s;tion on views of policy;
or forget what the degree of perfection is, to which our
<PB N="363" REF="422">
con&s;titution permits us to a&s;pire. To keep the allowance
for the frailties of our condition within as narrow bounds
as we &s;afely can,&mdash;this is a right and nece&s;&s;ary cour&s;e; be|cau&s;e
by means of &s;uch di&s;cipline we may improve and be
corrected. But to have &s;ome con&s;ideration of tho&s;e frail|ties,
&s;o as only to puni&s;h them in their degree as &s;uch, and
not in the &s;ame rank with the foule&s;t and mo&s;t odious
crimes,&mdash;this is no le&s;s a ju&s;t and &s;alutary rule; if the pu|ni&s;hment
is meant to have its due effect as an example, and
the people to be conciliated to the cour&s;e of criminal ju|&s;tice.
And here let me add, that tho&s;e who argue for the
reception of this plea into the law, are not, as at fir&s;t it might
be thought, appearing on the &s;ide of mercy. For if in
every ca&s;e the man&s;layer is to make atonement with his life,
without regard to the provocation, however high, which
he has &s;uffered; then may it be expected that juries will
find a general verdict for the pannel, when&s;oever they can|not
reconcile this &s;everity to their own con&s;cience; and
thus, (as actually happened in the ca&s;e of Finhaven), the
pannel &s;hall be di&s;ini&s;&s;ed without even that puni&s;hment,
which his intemperance de&s;erves. Now the allowance of the
inferior denomination of homicide, while it &s;aves the offend|er's
life, keeps him liable to &s;ome correction proportioned
to his fault, and maintains this &s;ort of &s;laughter in its due
place in the public opinion as a crime.</P>
<P>ALL con&s;iderations, therefore, i&s;&s;ue in one conclu&s;ion. The
invader, who offered the injury, knowing as he did the re|&s;entment
which it behoved to excite, was therein guilty of
a wrong; and ju&s;tly merited to receive upon the &s;pot, a &s;e|vere
cha&s;ti&s;ement of his per&s;on. And though the due mea|&s;ure
has been far exceeded; yet it were (I had almo&s;t &s;aid)
no le&s;s exce&s;&s;ive, to condemn this culprit to death, who
<PB N="364" REF="423">
has not &s;inned out of cruel di&s;po&s;ition or wickedne&s;s of heart,
and is neither that object of aver&s;ion to his neighbours, nor
that &s;ame irreclaimable and hopele&s;s member of &s;ociety, as
the wilful murderer, on whom mercy and pardon were thrown
away. Puni&s;hed he ought to be, that he may &s;tand corrected,
and others be taught the le&s;&s;on of patience by his example;
but there is no rea&s;on why he &s;hould &s;eal his repentance
with his blood, which, in civilized times, neither the fre|quency
of the offence, nor the public opinion will demand.</P>
<P>THESE &s;eem to be the obvious and rea&s;onable grounds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grounds of cul|pable Homicide on Provocation.</NOTE>
on which to maintain the di&s;tinction between culpable ho|micide
and murder; the one puni&s;hable with death, the
other at the di&s;cretion of the Judge. Reference has al&s;o
been made in &s;upport of it to the Jewi&s;h law, and to the Ro|man;
but, for my own part, I rather think, both unnece&s;&s;ari|ly,
and without &s;ucce&s;s. The texts of the civil law<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">L. 1. No. 3. ad leg. Corn. de Sicariis. L. 1. Cod. ej. Tit.</NOTE> &s;eem
rather to have relation to tho&s;e ca&s;es, where the &s;laughter
happens without intention to kill, and not to tho&s;e, where the
mortal purpo&s;e may be excu&s;ed. And with re&s;pect to the Jew|i&s;h
law<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Exodus, chap. xxi. ver. 13. 14.; Deut. ch. xix. ver. 4. 5. 6.; Numbers, ch. xxxv. ver. 15. to 28.</NOTE>, th
ough &s;ome of the pa&s;&s;ages may &s;eem to be ambi|guous;
yet on the whole, they give countenance to this opi|nion,
that even for a pure ca&s;ual &s;laughter, that which hap|pened
by accident and mi&s;adventure, without evil purpo&s;e,
the &s;layer &s;tood in need of the &s;afeguard of the &s;anctuary,
to defend him from the vengeance of the kindred of the de|cea&s;ed;
and that to any but him, even the city of refuge
was no protection. And this is perhaps the natural cour&s;e
<PB N="365" REF="424">
in the infancy of law and government, while the pa&s;&s;ions of
men are violent, and crimes are le&s;s puni&s;hed on any con|&s;iderations
of ju&s;tice or policy, than to allay the pa&s;&s;ions of
the individuals concerned.</P>
<P>BUT concerning this it is truly of little importance to en|quire:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Murder and <HI>chaude melle;</HI> Di&s;tinction of.</NOTE>
becau&s;e clear it is, upon the te&s;timony of our ancient
&s;tatutes<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See act 1425, c. 51.; 1426, c. 89. 95.; 1469, c. 35.; 1491, c. 28.; 1535, c. 23. See al&s;o Mackenzie, Tit. Murder, No. 11.</NOTE>, that the di&s;tinction of murder and &s;laughter on
&s;uddenty, or <HI>chaude melle,</HI> as it was termed, (hot quarrel, that
is, or heat of blood), had once been thoroughly e&s;tabli&s;hed in
the practice of Scotland. Not indeed on that regular and con|&s;i&s;tent
plan, which is &s;uitable to the improved juri&s;prudence
of later times; but &s;till in a &s;ub&s;tantial and efficacious form,
&s;uch as commonly an&s;wered the purpo&s;e of &s;aving the offend|er's
life, and which &s;ufficiently marks the &s;entiments of tho&s;e
times with re&s;pect to the degree of his offence, as contradi&s;|tingui&s;hed
to murder. It was the appointment of tho&s;e
laws, that the man&s;layer on &s;uddenty was to have the be|nefit
of the girth or &s;anctuary: He might flee to the church
or other holy place; from which he might indeed be taken
for trial, but to be returned thither, &s;afe in life and limb,
if his allegation of <HI>chaude melle</HI> were proved. Thus, though
the form of the relief was defective, and the application of
it irregular and uncertain, as it depended on the circum|&s;tance
of flying to and reaching the girth; yet &s;till (like the
benefit of clergy in England, which had the like &s;uper&s;ti|tious origin), it made a material difference in the law, and
was a mark of the different opinion of the country with re|&s;pect
to the two modes of homicide.</P>
<P><PB N="366" REF="425">
ON the Reformation, when the privilege of &s;anctuary was
aboli&s;hed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If aboli&s;hed at the Reforma|tion.</NOTE> this mode of relief was of cour&s;e at an end. But
as to the di&s;tinction of puni&s;hment in murder and <HI>chande melle,</HI>
which had hitherto been enforced by means of the <HI>jus a&s;yli;</HI>
whether the ju&s;t con&s;equence was that this al&s;o &s;hould be
aboli&s;hed along with that in&s;titution; this at lea&s;t is not &s;o
clear a po&s;ition. To tho&s;e who think that the circum&s;tance
of &s;anctuary was not it&s;elf the ground-work of the doctrine,
but an accident only in the external &s;hape and mode of ope|ration
of a precept, which is founded in the fir&s;t feelings
of humanity and ju&s;tice, it may rather &s;eem, that, unle&s;s a
&s;tatute had interpo&s;ed to abrogate the di&s;tinction, it &s;till be|hoved
to have effect in law; and that it lay with the Judges
of the land to devi&s;e &s;ome new and improved expedient,
by means of which the ends of ju&s;tice might with more
certainty, and in a more con&s;i&s;tent form, be attained. That
this was actually done, does not appear from the books of ad|journal.
On the other hand, (though &s;ome rigorous examples
may be produced), as little can it be &s;aid that they bear te&s;ti|mony
of &s;uch a cu&s;tom of judgment, or train of precedents,
as ab&s;olutely to &s;ix the law again&s;t the merciful con&s;truc|tion.</P>
<P>THIS,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chaude melle;</HI> if aboli&s;hed by Act 1661.</NOTE> it has however been alleged, was afterwards done, by
the &s;tatute of the 13th February 1649; which falling under
the general act re&s;ci&s;&s;ory of the u&s;urper's laws, was re-enact|ed
by the &s;tatute 1661, c. 22.; and which ordinance, if
in explicit terms it aboli&s;hes this humane di&s;tinction, or,
being ambiguous, if it has been &s;o con&s;trued by long and
uniform cu&s;tom, is without a doubt deci&s;ive of this im|portant
que&s;tion. But the&s;e things are far from being pa&s;t
di&s;pute.</P>

THE &s;tatute is entitled &startq;concerning the &s;everal <HI>degrees</HI> of
<HI>ca&s;ual</HI> homicide.&endq; It proceeds upon a narrative of being
intended to remove &startq;all doubt that may ari&s;e hereafter in cri|minal
pur&s;uits for &s;laughter.&endq; And it enacts in the&s;e words.
That the ca&s;es of homicide after following, <HI>viz.</HI> Ca&s;ual ho|micide,
homicide in lawful defence, and homicide com|mitted
upon thieves and robbers breaking hou&s;es in the
night; or in ca&s;e of homicide the time of ma&s;terful depre|dation,
or in the pur&s;uit of denounced or declared rebels for
capital crimes, or of &s;uch who a&s;&s;i&s;t and defend the rebels
and ma&s;terful depredators by arms, and by force oppo&s;e
the pur&s;uit and apprehending of them, which &s;hall happen
to fall out in time coming, nor any of them, &s;hall not be
puni&s;hed by death; and that notwith&s;tanding of any laws
or acts of Parliament, or any practick made heretofore, or
ob&s;erved in puni&s;hing of &s;laughter.&endq; Now, an argument is
rai&s;ed upon this ordinance; that being made for the &s;ettlement
of all doubts in this matter, and bearing a full enumeration of
tho&s;e ca&s;es of &s;laughter which &s;hall not be capitally puni&s;hed,
(ca&s;es all of them more favourable to the pannel than that of
&s;laughter in <HI>chaude melle</HI>), it by nece&s;&s;ary implication, ex|cludes
this la&s;t &s;pecies, from the benefit of the privilege
therein promulgated.</P>
<P>THE main an&s;wer to this argument has been:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chaude melle;</HI> if aboli&s;hed by Act. 1661.</NOTE> That under
the name of <HI>ca&s;ual homicide,</HI> and <HI>ca&s;ual homicide in defence,</HI> the &s;ta|tute
has truly made the exception of the very &s;pecies in que&s;|tion.
For that by the&s;e terms it does not intend a pure acci|dental
and inculpable &s;laughter, about which there never could
be any doubt that it was not liable to any penalty, far le&s;s to
the pain of death, but homicide upon ca&s;ual or occa&s;ional
rrencounter and &s;udden provocation, as contradi&s;tingui&s;hed
to homicide <HI>per indu&s;triam,</HI> wilful murder, or of malice afore|thought,
<PB N="368" REF="427">
and without excu&s;e from heat of blood. In &s;up|port
of this con&s;truction it is urged; that not only in com|mon
language, but al&s;o in the writings of lawyers, both
foreign and municipal<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">&startq;Nae &s;laughter done <HI>by chance</HI> or <HI>chaude melle</HI> &s;ould be callit murder, for all murder is committed of fore-thought felony.&endq; Balfour's Practicks, p. 512. &startq;Man&s;laughter committed voluntarily be fore-thought felony, or <HI>ca&s;ually by chaude melle,</HI> generally is puni&s;hed with death,&endq; <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Skene, of Crimes, tit. 2. c. 6.</NOTE>, and in the texts likewi&s;e of the
civil law, the term <HI>ca&s;ual</HI> has often been u&s;ed in this loo&s;e
and larger &s;en&s;e, to &s;ignify any thing that happens &s;udden|ly,
and on an unfore&s;een occa&s;ion; and that in this &s;en&s;e
it may properly be, and has been applied to &s;laughter com|mitted
in <HI>chaude melle;</HI> where the meeting, the provocation,
and even in &s;ome &s;ort the mortal &s;troke, are all of them
matters of chance and fatality, rather than de&s;ign. Farther,
and which is more material, it is argued, that in this
&s;en&s;e the term is u&s;ed in the rubrick of this very &s;tatute
&startq;concerning the &s;everal degrees of ca&s;ual homicide,&endq; &s;ee|ing
that pure accidental &s;laughter admits of no degrees,
but is always one and the &s;ame, and exempt from all man|ner
of pain. Nay more, (proceeds the argument), in this
&s;en&s;e it is even u&s;ed in the body it&s;elf of the &s;tatute, and in
that clau&s;e relative to &startq;the ca&s;e of <HI>homicide ca&s;ual,</HI> and of
homicide in defence,&endq; which empowers the Judge to fine
and impri&s;on the offender; a provi&s;ion utterly unapplicable

for the &s;aid Hew Crafurd, upon con&s;ideration of the
&s;aid haill depo&s;itions, we do humblie repoirt our opinion,
That the fore&s;aid &s;laughter committed be the &s;aid Hew
Crafurd was without any <HI>precogitate malice or forthought
fellonie;</HI> but that the &s;amyen was committed <HI>ex calore ira|cundiae,

way of friend&s;hip and familiarity drinking together,
conform to the narrative of the &s;aid remi&s;&s;ion: becau&s;e,
<HI>fir&s;t</HI> we find that the invitation to the alehou&s;e where the
&s;laughter was committed was from the defunct Wylie,
and not frae Crafurd, who was both unwilling to go to
the hou&s;e with him; and after the going was glade to be
red of Wylie when he was going away. <HI>Secundly,</HI> Both
Crafurd and the defunct Wylie denyed that there was any
<HI>malice or envy</HI> betwixt them; and it may be &s;eine that the
malice was betwixt Crafurd and Wylie's wyfe for mi&s;re|ports,
or upon the account of any threatening words &s;po|ken
by Crafurd before the act. We having examined the
witne&s;&s;es anent their knowledge of the ground thereof, we
find the &s;amyne &s;o frivolous and little cau&s;e, that we can|not
look upon them as grounds <HI>of ane precogitate malice or in|tention
to kill,</HI> e&s;pecially con&s;idering that their meeting to|gether
at that time was <HI>occa&s;ionally and accidentally</HI> upon
<PB N="371" REF="430">
the invitation and de&s;yre of Wylie, and having gone with
&s;ome others their neighbours in a familiar way together;
wheiras we conceive if the &s;amyne had been committed
<HI>upon forthought fellonie or precogitate malice,</HI> Crafurd would not
have de&s;yred &s;o many per&s;ons to have gone in with them
to drink to be witne&s;&s;es thereto. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> After Wylie
was going away and was pa&s;t the &s;pence door, and almo&s;t

<P>NOW, it is remarkable, that in this ca&s;e, which happened
&s;o recently after the &s;tatute 1661, that which is oppo&s;ed to
&s;laughter <HI>upon fore-thought felony or out of malice,</HI> is &s;laughter
upon <HI>accidental meeting or occa&s;ional rencounter,</HI> and proceed|ing
<HI>ex calore iracundiae,</HI> on <HI>provocation and a&s;&s;ault</HI> by the per|&s;on
&s;lain; which circum&s;tances are reported to his Maje&s;ty
as rea&s;ons for a pardon. The terms too, which are made
u&s;e of throughout this paper, are plainly the &s;ame in &s;ub|&s;tance
as that of <HI>ca&s;ual,</HI> which occurs in the &s;tatute 1661.</P>
<P>WHETHER deci&s;ive or not of the true meaning of the Le|gi&s;lature,
the&s;e remarks are at lea&s;t &s;ufficient to &s;how,
that the enactment is in &s;ome mea&s;ure doubtful and ob&s;cure.
And happily this &s;eems to be all that is requi&s;ite, for pre|&s;erving
this important doctrine to us, as a part of our law.
<PB N="372" REF="431">
Being grounded in the highe&s;t rea&s;on and humanity; being
confirmed by the practice of the mo&s;t enlightened nations; and
having of old been e&s;tabli&s;hed in our cu&s;tom, and acknow|ledged
by our &s;tatutes, in an efficacious and &s;ub&s;tantial form;
it could not therefore cea&s;e to be law, unle&s;s in virtue of a
&s;tatute which aboli&s;hed the di&s;tinction for the future, in
clear and unambiguous terms. Applied to a matter of this
&s;ort, it is a fair rule of con&s;truction, that the failure to ex|pre&s;s
and declare, is the &s;ame as the want of purpo&s;e. And
as long as they have it in their power, our Judges will
properly refu&s;e to believe, that the Legi&s;tature entertained
an intention which is plainly barbarous and unju&s;t.</P>
<P>WHETHER long and uniform practice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;truction of Act 1661 in Practice.</NOTE> con&s;tructive of
the &s;tatute in the unfavourable &s;en&s;e, would have been &s;uf|ficient
to decide this controver&s;y, and to bind our Courts to
&s;o rigorous a rule of judgment, is quite another que&s;tion,
and one in which there is happily no occa&s;ion to engage.
Becau&s;e in truth, the practice proved to be ju&s;t that fluctu|ating
and di&s;cordant practice, which is &s;uitable to the ambi|guity
of the &s;tatute, and might naturally be expected to
re&s;ult from it. Certainly, in&s;tances can be produced of libel
found relevant to infer the pains of death, and even of the
pains of death inflicted, in ca&s;es where gro&s;s provoca|tion
was proved to have been given. Such among others
is the ca&s;e of George Cumin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 6. 1695.</NOTE> and more e&s;pecially that of
Carnegie of Finhaven;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 1728.</NOTE> where the defence of a continued
train of provocation by rude behaviour, and injurious words
and ge&s;tures, and the&s;e followed with an a&s;&s;ault on the per|&s;on
of the pannel, by throwing him violently down into a
deep and offen&s;ive puddle, was found in&s;ufficient to protect
him from the ordinary pains of law, as for a murder. But
<PB N="373" REF="432">
the i&s;&s;ue was that the a&s;&s;ize, unable to reconcile this opinion
of the Court in point of law to their own feelings of huma|nity
and ju&s;tice on the ca&s;e, found a general verdict of <HI>not
guilty</HI> for the pannel; who was in con&s;equence di&s;mi&s;&s;ed
without even a cen&s;ure of his fault.</P>
<P>ON the other &s;ide, it is no le&s;s true, that in&s;tances, can be
&s;hown, equal at lea&s;t in number, and more than nece&s;&s;ary to keep
the con&s;truction of the &s;tatute open, of arbitrary puni&s;hment
applied to &s;ituations, where yet there was no ju&s;t pretence of
either a pure accidental &s;laughter, or of danger to the life of
the killer. The defence of previous a&s;&s;ault and beating,
was &s;u&s;tained to liberate from the ordinary pains in the ca&s;e
of Alexander Maxwell and others;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 3. &amp; 7. 1690.</NOTE> at the &s;ame time that the
defence of actual danger to the life was found relevant
<HI>&s;impliciter</HI> to a&s;&s;oilzie<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">&startq;Finds that part of the libel rai&s;ed by Alexander Maxwell, and the other pannels with him, and the defence founded thereon, <HI>viz.</HI> That there was pre|vious combination, whereupon followed the convocation libelled, to debar and keep out Mr Walter Macgill, the mini&s;ter, from entering into his church that Sunday, and when they were required to di&s;per&s;e, in&s;tead of doing thereof, they took the keys from the bedall, and beat the nottar and the mini&s;ter's wife, and others, before the &s;laughter, mutilation, or wounding was commit|ted, relevant to re&s;trict the &s;laughter to an arbitrary pain; but find, if the mi|ni&s;ter's life was a&s;&s;aulted, or any actual attempt by throwing great &s;tones at him before committing the &s;laughter libelled, the &s;ame is a defence &s;ufficient to liberate from the &s;laughter and other crimes libelled, <HI>&s;impliciter.</HI>&endq;</NOTE>. Another very appo&s;ite, and indeed
invincible ca&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 9. &amp; 16. 1701.</NOTE> is that of En&s;ign Hardie; in which, after
having repelled certain allegations of real injury, when
pleaded to the effect of &s;elf-defence, the Court &s;u&s;tained the
&s;ame facts as an aggre&s;&s;ion, to re&s;trict the libel to an arbi|trary

Some years after, even a le&s;s violent injury,

was found relevant to the &s;ame effect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 1. 1710.</NOTE> in the ca&s;e of Peter

<P>THERE could not in the&s;e in&s;tances be any doubt of the mor|tal
purpo&s;e;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;truction of Act 1661 in Practice.</NOTE> as the homicide was done with the proper weapons
of &s;laughter. And after them, though not of the &s;ame de&s;crip|tion
in that particular,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 19. and Dec. 7. 11. 1733.</NOTE> may properly be &s;ubjoined the ca&s;e of
John Chri&s;tie; where the manner of the homicide is de&s;cribed
to have been by throwing the decea&s;ed to the ground, and di&s;|patching
him, while in that &s;ituation, with repeated blows of a
big &s;tone, large &s;tick, or other mortal weapon, upon the head
and other parts of the body, whereby his &s;kull was fractu|red,
and death en&s;ued<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">&startq;And the &s;aid decea&s;ed George Crookbone, as became him, endeavouring to re&s;train your violence upon his &s;aid brother, and to prevent any further fight|ing or quarrelling with you, who having a big &s;tone or large &s;tick, or &s;ome other mortal weapon in your hands, and having tript or thrown down upon the ground the &s;aid decea&s;ed George Crookbone; at lea&s;t, while the &s;aid de|cea&s;ed George Crookbone was lying on the ground, and was in no condition, either to offend you, or to defend him&s;elf; you did with the &s;aid &s;tone or wea|pon, mo&s;t barbarou&s;ly, inhumanly and feloniou&s;ly, beat, knock and brui&s;e him upon the head, and &s;undry other parts of his body, while he was crying out <HI>he was gone,</HI> wherethrough he received a mortal wound or fracture of the bones in his head, and lay upon the &s;treets till he was lifted up, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted to walk to the hou&s;e of&mdash;, being all over blood, where he remained &s;peechle&s;s, till he died about eight o'clock, or &s;ome other hour of the moru|ing of that day.&endq;</NOTE>. This was an a&s;&s;ault of that &s;ort,
<PB N="375" REF="434">
from which no inference could ari&s;e on the face of the
charge, in favour of the pannel, that he did not intend to
kill. The libel was therefore found relevant to infer the
pains of law, and a proof at large was allowed the pannel
of all matters tending to alleviate or exculpate. The ver|dict
was thus: &startq;Find it proven, that at the time libelled
the decea&s;ed George Crookbone received a &s;troak on his
head, with a &s;tone from the pannel John Chri&s;tie, of which
he died; and find it likewi&s;e proven, that the pannel was
drunk, and was fir&s;t attacked by Thomas Crookbone, bro|ther
to the defunct George Crookbone, in which &s;cuffle
the defunct engaging, received from the pannel the wound
of which he died.&endq; Now what is here found in favour
of the pannel, neither amounts to &s;elf-defence, nor is repug|nant
to the notion of a mortal purpo&s;e. Yet his &s;entence was
only for tran&s;portation; which indeed, upon the footing of an
unintentional &s;laughter, would have been too &s;evere<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>If the Court looked into the proof for explanation of the general terms, u&s;ed in the interlocutor, they would find &s;till le&s;s rea&s;on to believe the pannel free of malice. For the fact as proved was, that the decea&s;ed, when lying on the ground with his $hat off, was repeatedly &s;truck on the head by the pannel, lying above or &s;tanding over him, and with a &s;tone clenched in his hand, which he had &s;tooped to take up, when the pannel fell.</P>
<P>In the trial of Thomas Roy at Aberdeen, September 17. 1759, the verdict found, &startq;That the &s;aid Thomas Roy did, time and place libelled, with a &s;tone, hit the &s;aid John Murray in the head, of which blow the &s;aid John Mur|ray thereafter died; but al&s;o found alleviating circum&s;tances proven.&endq; This ca&s;e was referred for the opinion of all the Judges; but the deci&s;ion was prevent|ed by a pardon. See the Record, June 24. 1760.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="376" REF="435">
LAST of all, I &s;hall cite the ca&s;e of James Chri&s;tie. The
pannel had &s;tabbed with a &s;word,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;truction of Act 1661 in Practice. Oct. 19. and Nov. 12. 15. 1731.</NOTE> but excu&s;ed the deed
on this ground, that he had found the decea&s;ed in the act of
adultery with his wife, and &s;acrificed him to his re&s;entment
on the &s;pot. This defence, the Court ju&s;tly found relevant
to re&s;trict the libel to an arbitrary pain<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">&startq;But for re&s;tricting the murder libelled to an arbitrary puni&s;hment, &s;u&s;tain this defence relevant, that the pannel killed the defunct, while he was in the act of adultery with the pannel's wife, and repel all the other defences.&endq; The jury found the libel not proven.</NOTE>. Yet, how rea&s;on|able
&s;oever this judgment, what other view can be taken of
&s;uch a ca&s;e, than as a ca&s;e of homicide on high provocation?
And though the provocation be high, yet is it in &s;ome re|&s;pects
not &s;o favourable to the pannel as that of other inju|ries;
becau&s;e the homicide is here done on the pure prin|ciple
of rage and revenge, unaccompanied with that fear of
farther violence, or that per&s;onal confu&s;ion and alarm, which,
in the ordinary ca&s;e of a&s;&s;ault on the body, concur with the
re&s;entment, and materially &s;trengthen the defence.</P>
<P>WHILE &s;uch was the fluctuating and di&s;cordant &s;tate of
practice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Culpable Homi|cide on Provo|cation now Part of the Law.</NOTE> in the con&s;truction of the &s;tatute 1661, no conclu|&s;ive
argument could well be reared upon that law, being
conceived in &s;o equivocal terms, to exclude tho&s;e &s;trong con|&s;iderations
of rea&s;on, humanity, and the example of other na|tions,
which all unite towards the allowance of this impor|tant
di&s;tinction. Of late years, the opinion of the Court
has been more favourable to the reception of it; and the
term <HI>culpable homicide,</HI> as &s;ignifying &s;laughter on great provo|cation,
and puni&s;hable at the di&s;cretion of the Judge, &s;eems
to be fa&s;t gaining an e&s;tabli&s;hment as a proper phra&s;e of
&s;tyle, in libels, interlocutors, and verdicts.</P>
<P><PB N="377" REF="436">
I REFER the reader to the following ca&s;es, in evidence of
this improvement of our practice.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;es of Homi|cide on Provo|cation. Feb. 4. 1788.</NOTE> Fir&s;t the ca&s;e of Richard
Firmin and Allan Macfarlane, who were charged with the
murder of Kennedy, by &s;hooting him with a mu&s;quet. At
calling, the Lord Advocate re&s;tricted his libel to a charge
of culpable homicide; and in the&s;e terms, though bearing
a narrative which left no doubt of the mortal purpo&s;e, it
was &s;u&s;tained by the Court to infer an arbitrary puni&s;hment.
There was formerly occa&s;ion to mention, that the pannels,
having acted in their duty, had a general verdict in their
favour.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, The ca&s;e of George White, Augu&s;t, 4. 1788.
The charge again&s;t him was alternative, as for murder or
culpable homicide; and the narrative of the libel was, that
he had killed the decea&s;ed by fir&s;t &s;triking him on the head
with a candle&s;tick, which beat him to the ground, and af|terwards
on the &s;ame part with a bottle, which cut and
wounded him; &s;o that he died of the con&s;equences. The
charge of murder was found relevant to infer the pains of
law, and the other charge to infer an arbitrary puni&s;hment.
He was convicted of culpable homicide only; and had &s;en|tence
to pay a fine of 100 merks, and to be impri&s;oned for
eight months.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, The ca&s;e of James M'Ghie, Jan. 17. 1791; who
killed the decea&s;ed by &s;triking him on the head, with a pair
of heavy iron tongs, while lying on the ground. In this ca&s;e
al&s;o the charge was alternative; and the pannel pleaded
in defence, the provocation and alarm of a violent a&s;&s;ault
made by the decea&s;ed on his father in his pre&s;ence, by
throwing him to the ground, and &s;everely beating him
when in that &s;ituation. The libel was found relevant, ge|nerally,
to infer the pains of law. He was convicted of
<PB N="378" REF="437">
culpable homicide, and had &s;entence of bani&s;hment from
Scotland for &s;even years.</P>
<P>IN the circuit-courts al&s;o, of late years, many charges
and convictions of culpable homicide have been the grounds
of &s;entence; though in ca&s;es where the manner of the a&s;|&s;ault
did not give any rea&s;on to pre&s;ume, that the pannel
was not actuated by a mortal or highly outrageous purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT though the di&s;tinction of murder and homicide on
provocation has thus at length become a part of our law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Requi&s;ite De|gree of Provo|cation.</NOTE> as
of that of England; it is not however to be imagined, that it is
therefore e&s;tabli&s;hed in the preci&s;e &s;ame terms in both, or that
our practice has adopted the opinions of the Engli&s;h lawyers
with re&s;pect to the kind or degree of provocation, which
will &s;ave from the ordinary pains. On the contrary, there
is in this article a great and &s;ub&s;tantial difference between
our &s;y&s;tem and theirs. Thus far the two coincide, that no
provocation of words, the mo&s;t foul and abu&s;ive, nor of &s;igns
and ge&s;tures, how contemptuous or deri&s;ive &s;oever, is of
&s;ufficient weight in the &s;cale, materially to alleviate the
guilt; &s;o that if John, upon words or &s;igns of reproach by
James, &s;traightway take up a knife and &s;tab him, or a heavy
hammer and beat out his brains, he &s;hall be judged a
murderer, and die. In this al&s;o their doctrine agrees, that
they make no account of provocation by tre&s;pa&s;s on lands
or goods, if not accompanied with violence to the per&s;on;
whereby, if John find James breaking down his fence, or en|tering
his inclo&s;ure to &s;earch for game without his leave, or
pa&s;turing cattle on his grounds, or poinding John's cattle
when they are upon John's own property; in none of the&s;e
ca&s;es is it any thing le&s;s than murder, if John &s;hall be &s;o far
tran&s;ported with rage at this trivial and reparable offence,
<PB N="379" REF="438">
as to knock the tre&s;pa&s;&s;er on the head. In this all the
Engli&s;h authorities are agreed<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Fo&s;ter, p. 290. 291.; Hale, vol. 1. p. 455. 456.; Hawkins, b. 1. c. 31. No. 27. No. 33.; Black&s;tone, vol. iv. p. 200.</NOTE>; and certainly for rea&s;ons
&s;o obvious and convincing as admit of no reply.</P>
<P>BUT it is farther the &s;entiment of &s;everal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Requi&s;ite De|gree of Provo|cation.</NOTE> and among the
able&s;t of their writers on law, that <HI>any</HI> a&s;&s;ault on the per&s;on
of the killer &s;ufficiently extenuates his guilt, to lower the ca&s;e
to man&s;laughter; though the injury be nothing more than a
&s;ingle blow with the hand, or twi&s;ting the no&s;e, or a fillip on
the forehead, or ju&s;tling in the &s;treet, or whipping the per|&s;on's
hor&s;e out of the track<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Hale, p. 455. 456.; Hawkins, b. 1. c. 31. No. 36.; Black&s;tone, vol. iv. p. 191.</NOTE>. Farther; it is the concur|ring
doctrine of all their books, that where on a &s;udden
quarrel, parties fight upon the &s;pot with mortal weapons,
and on equal terms, (each giving the other time to draw
and be on his guard); or even if in heat of blood they fetch
their weapons, and go to the field and fight; there al&s;o the
deed comes under the notion of man&s;laughter only<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Fo&s;ter, p. 295. No. 3. p. 297. No. 5.; Hawkins, vol. i. c. 31. No. 28. 29. and 34.; Black&s;tone, vol. iv. p. 191.</NOTE>: and
this without any regard to the fir&s;t provocation, whether it
be verbal or real, or from which of the parties it come.</P>
<P>NOW,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Requi&s;ite De|gree of Prove|cation.</NOTE> in all the&s;e articles, our practice is formed upon
quite another plan. To have a good plea of extenuation,
the pannel, at the time of killing, mu&s;t have &s;tood in the
&s;ituation of an a&s;&s;aulted and injured per&s;on; one who was in
a manner con&s;trained to &s;trike by the violence which he
<PB N="380" REF="439">
was &s;uffering from the decea&s;ed. If in any degree the mor|tal
&s;trife was matter of convention between the parties,
though but tacitly, and taken up at the moment; if the mor|tal
blow was pot the impul&s;e of in&s;tant pain and agitation,
but of a purpo&s;e to fight as on a certain plan and &s;et of prin|ciples;
this, according to our notions, is murder in the &s;ur|viver.
In which point of view,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;e of Fair Combat in Heat of Blood.</NOTE> the circum&s;tance of waiting,
till the other party draw and be on his guard; that favour|able
circum&s;tance which makes it man&s;laughter by the law of
England; would not with us be of any advantage to the pan|nel,
as &s;hewing plain deliberation, pre&s;ence of mind, and me|thod
in his revenge. This, our rule, is proved by the two ca&s;es
formerly related,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 17. 1670.</NOTE> of James Murray and James Gray, both of
them ca&s;es of fair combat in heat of blood and on a re|cent
quarrel.<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 11. 1678.</NOTE> To which may be added (though with re&s;pect
to the &s;ufficiency of the evidence, the verdict has been
thought que&s;tionable),<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 4. 1667.</NOTE> the ca&s;e of William Douglas, for the
&s;laughter of Home of Eccles, which was &s;hortly thus: That
the&s;e per&s;ons along with others, had quarrelled when at

to the adjacent fields, where they &s;et to con&s;u&s;edly with
&s;words, two again&s;t two; and Home was killed, as was al|leged
(and indeed I think is proved), by Douglas. The &s;ame
principle &s;eems to have ruled in the ca&s;e of Andrew Ru|therford,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 9. &amp; 16. 1674.</NOTE>
indicted for the murder of James Douglas. This
&s;laughter had taken place on a &s;udden quarrel, of which
it could not be &s;aid on the proof who was the author, or
who had been the fir&s;t to draw: only the parties were &s;een by
per&s;ons at &s;ome di&s;tance to alight from their hor&s;es and
thru&s;t at each other, neither of them, as far as appeared, ta|king
undue advantage, or giving back or declining the com|bat.
The jury found the &s;laughter proved, and the &s;elf|defence
<PB N="381" REF="440">
not proved. And the Court, who by their interlo|cutor
had previou&s;ly required it of the pannel to bring proof
of &s;elf-defence, gave &s;entence of death.</P>
<P>WITH us too, though not always a deci&s;ive, it is general|ly
an unfavourable circum&s;tance for the pannel in this que|&s;tion,
that he has &s;truck the fir&s;t blow. If John &s;trike James
a blow with the hand, and James return it with &s;evere blows
of a &s;taff, on which John, being hurt and irritated, draws,
but gives James time to do the like, and thus they fight and
James is killed, this is murder by the Scotti&s;h practice;
however &s;uch a ca&s;e might be re&s;olved in the courts of Eng|land.
We cannot make the &s;ame allowance for his being
provoked, who is only in a &s;ituation to be &s;o by his own in|temperate
and unlawful act, and has &s;hewn an ab&s;olute di&s;|regard
of tho&s;e very emotions in his neighbour, which he
would have excu&s;ed in his own ca&s;e. His a&s;&s;ault of his
neighbour's per&s;on ju&s;tified the return of blows; and, though
there be exce&s;s, he cannot therefore be either ju&s;tifiable or
excu&s;able to re&s;ent the&s;e, (while they do not put his life in
danger), unto the death of his neighbour. This rule is
pointedly announced in the interlocutor on the ca&s;e of
En&s;ign Hardie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 9. 1701.</NOTE> where it is &s;u&s;tained to re&s;trict the libel to
an arbitrary pain, that the decea&s;ed was the fir&s;t aggre&s;&s;or,
and had laid hold of the hor&s;e's bridle, and &s;truck Hardie
on the face with a rung or tree: but this pa&s;&s;age immediate|ly
follows; &startq;But &s;ind the <HI>reply</HI> made by the pur&s;uers, that
the pannel beat the defunct on the face with a thrawn
rod before he &s;truck the pannel with the rung or tree, re|levant
to elide the fore&s;aid defence <HI>&s;impliciter.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>THE difference is &s;till more remarkable with regard to the
degree of injury and provocation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Requi&s;ite De|gree of Provo|cation.</NOTE> which will be received

(&s;ince the invariable cour&s;e of judgment makes it needle&s;s to
accumulate authorities),<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 8. &amp; 9. 1693.</NOTE> the ca&s;e of William Aird, for the
murder of Agnes Bayne, by throwing her backwards down
&s;tairs. The allegation was here repelled, of her having pro|voked
him by to&s;&s;ing the contents of a chamber-pot in his
face<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">In the ca&s;e of Jo&s;eph Hume, February 26. 1732, a defence of jo&s;tling and verbal abu&s;e was once made, but almo&s;t immediately abandoned.</NOTE>. In &s;hort, it is to be under&s;tood, that it does not
come up to the due de&s;cription of the defence by our
law, that the pannel is in rage and heat of blood, though
owing to &s;ome improper freedom which the decea&s;ed has
taken with his per&s;on: This pa&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be occa&s;ioned by
&s;ome adequate and &s;erious cau&s;e, &s;ome &s;evere and continued
a&s;&s;ault, &s;uch as carries agitation and alarm with it, a dread of
farther harm and injury, as well as pre&s;ent &s;mart and pain
of body; whereby the &s;ufferer is <HI>excu&s;able</HI> in the lo&s;s of his
pre&s;ence of mind, and exce&s;s of the ju&s;t mea&s;ure of reta|liation.
Excepting the peculiar ca&s;e of &s;laughter com|mitted
on the adulterer di&s;covered in the fact, I am ac|quainted
with no ca&s;e of culpable homicide in our record,
which is not more or le&s;s of this de&s;cription; not a ca&s;e of
pa&s;&s;ion only, but of pa&s;&s;ion excited by bodily &s;uffering, and
mingled with terror, and with perturbation of &s;pirits. And
truly it may be doubted, whether in this our rule is not
wi&s;er and more &s;alutary, at lea&s;t more &s;uitable to the fer|vent
temper of the Scotti&s;h people, than that of the neigh|bouring
<PB N="383" REF="442">
kingdom, which excu&s;es the mortal revenge of &s;uch
incon&s;iderable wrongs. To curb and repre&s;s an over-jea|lous,
choleric, or quarrel&s;ome humour, as far as can be
done without inju&s;tice in the particular ca&s;e, and thus to
bend the temper to the cour&s;e of civil order, is the main
&s;cope of law in this whole department of offences again&s;t the
per&s;on. And this object &s;eems to be duly kept in view in our
practice, when it has con&s;ideration of human infirmity in
tho&s;e difficult and agitating &s;ituations only, which require
a more than ordinary &s;trength of mind, and command of
temper to with&s;tand them; not in tho&s;e, where the pride
more than the body of the man has been offended.</P>
<P>HOWEVER this may be, upon which it would not become
the lawyers of either country to expre&s;s them&s;elves with
confidence, clear it is, that &s;uch is our fixed and certain
rule.</P>
<P>AND here I &s;hall take occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve touching the noted
ca&s;e of Mungo Campbell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;e of Mungo Campbell.</NOTE> though certainly a ca&s;e of difficul|ty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 1769.</NOTE>
and well de&s;erving of that deliberate attention which it
received,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 1770.</NOTE> that it was judged in &s;trict conformity to the
whole &s;eries of precedents, either of an ancient or a modern
date, that are to be found upon record. On the whole
circum&s;tances of the &s;ituation, even tho&s;e of the Judges who
were mo&s;t favourable to the pannel, and along with them
the jury had been of opinion, that the injury to his per&s;on
was not of that degree, nor had been pro&s;ecuted to that
length<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Notes of the opinions of the Judges in this ca&s;e, in Maclaurin's Criminals.</NOTE>, which could excu&s;e his pa&s;&s;ion, or extenuate the
guilt; &s;o that the deed was rather to be held a wilful and
<PB N="384" REF="443">
re&s;entful deed, the fruit of the habit of mind, the proud and
jealous temper of the man, who acted deliberately on the
occa&s;ion, than of excu&s;able perturbation and terror, or im|mediate
di&s;tre&s;s of body. If, in pro&s;ecution of his unlaw|ful
purpo&s;e, Lord Eglinton had advanced on Campbell,
and had laid hold of the piece; and thus a per&s;onal &s;truggle
had en&s;ued, in which Campbell, defending his property,
(and certainly he was not obliged to quit it), had been
beaten and overpowered, or injured in his body, before di&s;|charging
his piece; this would have been a far more favour|able
ca&s;e, and indeed, in my mind, hardly di&s;tingui&s;hable
from that already mentioned, of Maclean, in 1710, where
an a&s;&s;ault on a per&s;on, to take his carabine from him, was
found relevant to re&s;trict the libel to an arbitrary pain. For
this would not have been a &s;ituation of &s;imple tre&s;pa&s;s on
goods, but of tre&s;pa&s;s nece&s;&s;arily coupled to a&s;&s;ault of the
per&s;on. But taking all the particulars of this unfortunate
&s;tory; it could &s;carcely be &s;aid that Campbell had been at
all a&s;&s;aulted, or had any rea&s;onable or well grounded ap|prehen&s;ion
of future harm to his per&s;on. Certainly, at the
time of di&s;charging his piece, any provocation he had yet
received was not higher than if he had been ju&s;tled in pa&s;|&s;ing,
or pulled by the no&s;e, or kicked on the breech; no
one of which indignities, according to any authority or pre|cedent
that can be produced in the law of Scotland, would
have been &s;ufficient to excu&s;e him. In fine, he had &s;hown
nothing of that forbearance, that phlegm and tardine&s;s of
blood, which, according to the cour&s;e of our practice, is a
nece&s;&s;ary accompanyment of this plea, but rather a cho|leric
and jealous di&s;po&s;ition ha&s;tily to lay hold of the fir&s;t
opportunity of offence, for the purpo&s;e of revenge.</P>

FROM what has now been &s;aid, with regard to the degree
of injury which will extenuate the guilt of &s;laughter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Provocation by Execution of ir|regular War|rants.</NOTE> there
re&s;ults an important, but it &s;hould &s;eem an unavoidable con|&s;equence,
touching the con&s;truction of that &s;laughter, which
is committed in re&s;i&s;tance of defective and irregular warrants,
or warrants executed in an irregular way. A me&s;&s;enger by
mi&s;take arre&s;ts John, in&s;tead of James; or on a warrant
again&s;t John, he arre&s;ts that per&s;on, who knows him not,
without &s;aying who or what he is; or he arre&s;ts John on
a warrant which bears an erroneous de&s;cription of him, or
is otherwi&s;e not in due form of law. In &s;ome of the&s;e
ca&s;es the pri&s;oner &s;uffers a degree of provocation at the
time; and it may be &s;aid, that in all of them there is a
wrong or tre&s;pa&s;s on the part of the officer, who ought to &s;ee
that his warrant is good, and &s;hould proceed lawfully in the
execution of it. But to hold, which &s;eems to be the rule in
the neighbouring kingdom, that it is &s;uch a wrong as will ex|cu&s;e
the party thus mole&s;ted, if on mention of the mi&s;take, and

or analogy of the law of Scotland. Very &s;uitable
it may be to the re&s;t of the Engli&s;h practice, which holds
<PB N="386" REF="445">
that a pull by the no&s;e, or a fillip on the forehead, (injuries
not more material than a rude inva&s;ion of a per&s;on's liber|ty),
is a provocation to extenuate the guilt. But as &s;uitable
as &s;uch a rule is to their practice, as un&s;uitable it would be
to ours, which is quite a &s;tranger to any plea of extenua|tion
grounded on &s;uch trivial offences, and requires a proof
of bodily di&s;tre&s;s and agitation of &s;pirits in the ca&s;e of a&s;|&s;ault
by any ordinary man, and much more will require it
in the ca&s;e of an officer of the law; who may indeed be in
the wrong, or fall into an error, but has commonly &s;ome co|lour
of excu&s;e, and opinion of duty, more or le&s;s, for what
he doth. Though he do err, &s;till he is not dive&s;ted of his
character of &s;ervant of the law, which is it&s;elf entitled to
regard; as well as in all ca&s;es where he is known to be act|ing
in that capacity, the motive, &s;cope, and extent of his
purpo&s;e, are at the &s;ame time evident to the party; &s;o that
by compliance, which is here a &s;afe mea&s;ure, all fear of
farther violence &s;hall at once be at end: Not to mention the
more certain means of redre&s;s of the wrong, and puni&s;h|ment
of the offender, which the per&s;on aggrieved enjoys in
all ca&s;es of this de&s;cription. If therefore, in&s;tead of &s;ubmit|ting
for the time, as any man of a well regulated mind would
be di&s;po&s;ed to, he &s;hall take advantage of the mi&s;take,
&s;traightway to &s;tab or &s;hoot the officer, before any great
&s;truggle has en&s;ued, or any grievous harm of body been
&s;u&s;tained by him; certainly, in con&s;i&s;tency with the re&s;t of
our law, he cannot be found guilty of any lower crime than
murder.</P>
<P><PB N="387" REF="446">
PUT the ca&s;e, that a Sheriff's officer having warrant
again&s;t a criminal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Provocation by Execution of a vitious War|rant, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> has ignorantly followed him beyond the
bounds of the &s;heriffdom; and having overtaken, has laid
hold of him by the collar of the coat, to keep him, but with|out
&s;triking, or offering other violence to his per&s;on. If
in this &s;ituation the pri&s;oner draw a knife and &s;tab the offi|cer,
he can neither be ju&s;tified nor excu&s;ed. Becau&s;e even
between man and man, and &s;uppo&s;ing the one party not to
be an officer of the law, nor the other a felon, this purpo&s;e
of detention, and executed in &s;o moderate a way, is not a
wrong of that degree, which would at all extenuate the
guilt of &s;laughter. And &s;urely if it is not more, the ca&s;e is
at lea&s;t not le&s;s favourable to the officer, on account of the&s;e
circum&s;tances in the relative &s;ituation of the parties. If a
&s;truggle and beating en&s;ue on the attempt, it will depend on
the degree of violence, as in other ca&s;es, whether this will
bring down the charge to culpable homicide. Or if the offi|cer,
being re&s;i&s;ted, &s;trike the felon &s;o as to put him in danger
of his life; &s;till, to be completely <HI>ju&s;tified,</HI> the felon mu&s;t ob|&s;erve
the <HI>moderamen inculpatae tutelae</HI> in his defence: for &s;o he
mu&s;t have done on occa&s;ion even of a cau&s;ele&s;s and mali|cious
quarrel, fa&s;tened on him by any one of the people, with|out
pretence of warrant, or opinion of duty, to &s;upport him.
On the whole, there &s;eems to be the highe&s;t equity and
rea&s;on in con&s;idering the hard &s;ituation of an officer of the
law, to whom the defect of his warrant may often be utter|ly
impo&s;&s;ible to be known, and who as often cannot judge
of the defect, and is obliged by his duty to proceed in the
execution of it; and yet according to the &s;uppo&s;ed doctrine
of the law of England, may be killed with impunity by a
ruffian, equally ignorant of that defect as the officer, and
<PB N="388" REF="447">
who is only actuated at the time by malignity and brutal
rage.</P>
<P>THE chief illu&s;tration of this doctrine is the late ca&s;e
of John and Arthur O'Neal.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 5. and Feb. 4. 2. &amp; 4. 1796.</NOTE> The&s;e pannels were father and
&s;on; and a warrant had been i&s;&s;ued again&s;t them, as idle and
di&s;orderly per&s;ons, to apprehend, and bring them for exa|mination,
in order to their being adjudged as &s;oldiers, under
a &s;tatute which gave powers to that effect. The men were
known to be re&s;olute, and to have a purpo&s;e of re&s;i&s;ting the
warrant, which had come to their knowledge; and a party of
&s;oldiers was therefore &s;ent with the con&s;table, to &s;upport him
in his office. On their arrival at the hou&s;e, and after notifi|cation
of their bu&s;ine&s;s to tho&s;e within, but before any at|tempt
to break open the door, three &s;hot were immediately
fired at the party, (indeed it was proved that they had pro|vided
&s;hot and loaded their guns, on purpo&s;e to re&s;i&s;t);
and &s;hortly after three &s;hot more were fired; whereby one
man was killed, and &s;everal were wounded. In charging the
jury (for it was not pleaded to the Court on the relevancy),
the pannels coun&s;el took two exceptions to the warrant,
as not within the terms of the &s;tatute; 1<HI>&s;t,</HI> That it was
not under the &s;eal as well as the hand of the magi&s;trates,
(which no Scots warrant is); and, 2<HI>dly,</HI> That the warrant
bore a blank day of examination, in&s;tead of the next law|ful
day of meeting, according to the direction of the act.
But the Lord Ju&s;tice-Clerk, to whom it fell to addre&s;s the
jury before inclo&s;ing, and who alone of all the Judges had
an opportunity of &s;peaking on this objection, was very
explicit in his opinion, that the&s;e circum&s;tances, which
were utterly unknown at the time of the &s;laughter, were no
extenuation of the guilt. The jury found the father guilty,
and he had &s;entence of death. He afterwards received a
<PB N="389" REF="448">
pardon; but on what grounds has not been communicated to
the public.</P>
<P>AFTER the&s;e circum&s;tances of difference in the practice
of the two countries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Excu&s;e if the killing be deliberate.</NOTE> I &s;hall now take notice of one article
of doctrine in which they are agreed. This is in excluding
the defence, in any ca&s;e where, on the whole circum&s;tances of
his behaviour, the pannel &s;hall appear to have acted delibe|rately,
and to have been ma&s;ter of his emotions. If the
hu&s;band find the adulterer in the act, and kill him on the
&s;pot, he is excu&s;able for this tran&s;port of &s;udden rage on &s;uch
an injury: but if he confine him till next day, and then kill
him, or if he force him to &s;wallow a do&s;e of poi&s;on, or if he
ca&s;trate him, and the per&s;on die of the operation; in all
the&s;e ca&s;es he has lo&s;t the privilege which is allowed to hu|man
infirmity. In like manner, a &s;choolma&s;ter; if in&s;tead
of in&s;tant correction in the u&s;ual way, he &s;hall &s;end for
&s;ome extraordinary in&s;trument of torture, or &s;hall bind his
pupil neck and heel, and &s;courge him in that po&s;ture, or
&s;hall lock him up for an hour, and then &s;courge him &s;o
that he dies; he cannot pretend to have been actuated by
the due motives as a preceptor, and &s;hall an&s;wer it like any
other man. For all the&s;e are acts of deliberate and inven|tive
cruelty, on a principle of revenge; which is always
murder<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Fo&s;ter, p. 296. 7.; Hale, vol. i. p. 453&mdash;4.; Hawkins, vol. i. p. 81. No. 23.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN the clo&s;e of all, I &s;hall venture to ob&s;erve, that as
with regard to the degree of provocation which makes
a ca&s;e of culpable homicide, &s;o al&s;o with regard to the
judgment which may competently pa&s;s on the offender, it
may de&s;erve to be con&s;idered, whether our law is not upon
as &s;alutary a footing as that of England. For our Judges
<PB N="390" REF="449">
have a di&s;cretion in this matter, to condemn the man&s;layer
to &s;uch a puni&s;hment, according to the mea&s;ure of his fault,
which &s;hall truly &s;erve as a correction to him, and a warn|ing
to others. Whereas, in England, the judgment is one
invariable thing, the forfeiture of moveables, and burning
in the hand; which is very unequal in its application to the
different conditions of life, and if carried into effect, may
be either too &s;evere or too lenient a cour&s;e; but as &s;ome|times
managed, by gift of the forfeiture to the offender him|&s;elf,
becomes no puni&s;hment at all. But I find that I am
now venturing out of my proper &s;phere.</P>
<P>VI.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Murder; what its characteri&s;|tic.</NOTE> To proceed, therefore, with our &s;ubject. I &s;hall now
examine the third degree of homicide, the crime of WILFUL
MURDER, for which the laws of all civilized nations, here|in
conform to the Divine law, admit of no atonement, but
with the offender's life.</P>
<P>THE characteri&s;tic of this &s;ort of homicide is, that it is
done wilfully, and out of malice afore-thought. But the&s;e
terms are not here to be received in their re&s;tricted and mo&s;t
obvious &s;en&s;e, of a rooted and &s;pecial enmity to the decea|&s;ed,
but only in the larger and more general &s;en&s;e of <HI>dole,</HI>
or a wicked and mi&s;chievous purpo&s;e, and as contradi&s;tin|gui&s;hed
to tho&s;e motives of nece&s;&s;ity, duty, or allowable in|firmity,
which may &s;erve to ju&s;tify or to excu&s;e the deed.</P>
<P>How far this con&s;truction will hold again&s;t the pan|nel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mu&s;t the Malice be &s;pecial, or prior to Meet|ing.</NOTE>
in the ca&s;e of a mortal purpo&s;e not particularly directed

in the general title of Crimes, and &s;hall not now be

little does it lie with the pro&s;ecutor, to a&s;&s;ign or prov$ any
<PB N="391" REF="450">
probable cau&s;e to which it may be a&s;cribed, or to &s;hew
that it has been of long endurance, or even prior to the fa|tal
meeting of the parties. The more &s;trange and unac|countable
&s;uch malignity, the deeper is the guilt of the deed;
and how recent &s;oever the occa&s;ion of it, if it precede and
be the motive of the mortal blow, &startq;<HI>&s;i antecedit ictum licet
non congre&s;&s;um,</HI>&endq; the crime is murder, and the pannel's life
&s;hall be forfeited for that which he has thus unnece&s;&s;arily,
and without provocation, de&s;troyed. The malice is im|plied
in the act it&s;elf of intentional killing, which is the
highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible injury, and naturally carries with it the pre|&s;umption
of <HI>malus animus;</HI> which it therefore lies on the
pannel to overcome by proof made on his part, of &s;ome of

might be &s;welled to a great bulk, notice may al&s;o be taken
of an entire cla&s;s of ca&s;es, in which I do not ob&s;erve
that any charge of malice has ever been made; I mean
ca&s;es of child-murder. The rea&s;on is, that the infant or|dinarily
<PB N="394" REF="453">
is de&s;troyed at the very moment of the birth, and
before, in any proper &s;en&s;e, it can be the object of the mo|ther's
hatred. It may farther be remarked, that while the
fa&s;hion of &s;pecial interlocutors of relevancy continued, this of
hatred born the decea&s;ed, though often &s;tated in the libel, is
one of tho&s;e articles which the interlocutor never repeated,
nor required to be proved. Thus, on the whole, the malice
which the law requires in this particular, turns out to be no
more than this,&mdash;a depraved and wicked di&s;po&s;ition; a heart
regardle&s;s of duty or humanity; which is to be gathered
from the whole circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, as they are &s;hown
in evidence.</P>
<P>THIS will more plainly appear,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Animus occiden|di,</HI> how far e&s;|&s;ential.</NOTE> if it be con&s;idered, that
even the <HI>animus occidendi,</HI> the purpo&s;e to deprive the decea&s;ed
of life, is not e&s;&s;ential to the charge of murder; that is to
&s;ay, in the mo&s;t obvious &s;en&s;e of the phra&s;e, and that in which
it is ordinarily under&s;tood. If indeed the pannel bring a
proof of &s;uch circum&s;tances in exculpation, or can point out
&s;uch in the manner of the a&s;&s;ault which is related in the libel,
as are repugnant to the very notion of a mortal purpo&s;e, and
&s;how that the &s;laughter fell out in an improbable and unex|pected
manner, and in the pro&s;ecution of &s;ome inferior and not
outrageous object; certainly this will have its due effect of
re&s;tricting the charge to an arbitrary pain. This matter
was formerly illu&s;trated, in the ca&s;e of death taking place
on a &s;ingle blow with the hand, or on a fall, occa&s;ioned by
a pu&s;h or jo&s;tling. Of the &s;ame character al&s;o are &s;uch ca&s;es
as the&s;e: If the pannel, having a drawn &s;word in his hand,
throw it away and betake him&s;elf to a &s;taff; or if having a
loaded pi&s;tol, he fire it off in the air and &s;trike with the but;
unle&s;s the&s;e favourable circum&s;tances, which yield probable e|vidence
<PB N="395" REF="454">
of a purpo&s;e to cha&s;ti&s;e only, &s;hall be outweighed by
after exce&s;s in the u&s;e of tho&s;e in&s;truments, or by other in|cidents
in the progre&s;s of the conte&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT, with the exception of ca&s;es of this de&s;cription,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Animus occiden|di,</HI> how far e&s;|&s;ential.</NOTE> our
practice, which in this is the &s;ame as that of England<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hale, vol. i. p. 454. 472.; Hawkins, vol. i. p. 74. No. 10. p. 83. No. 38.; Fo&s;ter, p. 291. No. 2.; Plack&s;tone, vol. iv. p. 199.</NOTE>, does
not di&s;tingui&s;h between an ab&s;olute purpo&s;e to kill, and the
purpo&s;e to do any exce&s;&s;ive and grievous injury to the per&s;on.
So that if the pannel a&s;&s;aulted the decea&s;ed meaning to ham|&s;tring
him, or to cut out his tongue, or to break his bones, or
to beat him &s;everely, (or, as it is vulgarly expre&s;&s;ed, to beat
him within an inch of his life), and in the pro&s;ecution of this
outrageous purpo&s;e has actually de&s;troyed his victim, he &s;hall
equally die for it, as if he had run him through the body
with a &s;word. And the rea&s;ons are obvious and &s;atisfac|tory,
why no other judgment can pa&s;s on &s;uch a ca&s;e. Be|cau&s;e
to ob&s;erve any other rule, would be to &s;ecure an in|demnity
to all but tho&s;e, comparatively rare, ca&s;es of mur|der,
which are done with the peculiar in&s;truments of &s;laugh|ter.
Becau&s;e, in committing any &s;uch flagrant outrage on
the body, the pannel &s;hews an utter contempt of the &s;afety,
di&s;tre&s;s, and exi&s;tence of his neighbour, and if not a deter|mination
to kill him, at lea&s;t an ab&s;olute indifference about
the con&s;equence to him, whether he live or die. And be|cau&s;e,
from the very exce&s;s of the injury, the ca&s;e does not
admit any clear or conclu&s;ive proof on the part of the pan|nel,
that at the moment of killing he did not mean the thing
to follow, which actually happened. In great injuries and
violences there is no wounding by rule, &s;o as with cer|tainty
<PB N="396" REF="455">
not to kill. Neither is there in nature any preci&s;e
mea&s;ure of the rage and mi&s;chievous feeling at &s;uch mo|ments
of furious action, by which even the actor him&s;elf
can certainly tell, and much le&s;s can others di&s;cover, whe|ther
he meant to kill, or barely to leave life in the ob|ject
of his revenge. If he an&s;wer truly with re&s;pect to his
&s;tate of con&s;cience on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, all that he can &s;ay
will be, that he was tran&s;ported with rage and hatred, and
cared not what became of it, &s;o he had his vengeance out.
He mu&s;t therefore be accountable for it as a murder; &s;ince
knowing the&s;e things, he neverthele&s;s re&s;olved, that rather
than forego his vengeance, or employ &s;ome inferior means,
his neighbour &s;hould run this hazard of his life; &s;o low was
his regard of his neighbour's &s;afety. Now this <HI>corrupt di&s;|regard</HI>
of the per&s;on and exi&s;tence of another, is preci&s;ely
the dole or malice, the depraved and wicked purpo&s;e, which
the law requires and is content with<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">&startq;Dolo&s;um homicidium e&s;t, quod vel animo et propo&s;ito occidendi, vol &s;o|lum vulnerandi voluntate committitur.&endq; Carp&s;. Quae&s;t. 27. n. 5.</NOTE>. It looks with a
jealous eye upon every act that has de&s;troyed a man; and
where&s;oever any one has been killed by the hand of his
neighbour lifted in outrageous or continued violence again&s;t
him, will pre&s;ume that if not at fir&s;t invaded, he was at lea&s;t
continued to be abu&s;ed, out of growing rage and malignity,
and with a purpo&s;e of doing that which in the end was done.
In &s;hort, to have the benefit of the plea of culpable homicide,
he mu&s;t either point out &s;uch circum&s;tances upon the face of
the charge in the libel, or in the evidence brought in &s;upport
of it, or he mu&s;t bring &s;uch a proof on his own part, as
&s;hews that the mi&s;chief which he meant was of that infe|rior
kind, from which, according to the common cour&s;e of
<PB N="397" REF="456">
things, not even any material danger of the per&s;on's life
was to be dreaded.</P>
<P>AMONG the many ca&s;es which might be appealed to in
evidence of this ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary rule of practice,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Animus occiden|di,</HI> how far e&s;|&s;ential.</NOTE> that
which perhaps to mo&s;t advantage illu&s;trates it, is the ca&s;e of
Dougal Macfarlane, tried in November 1737. This man
had quarrelled with John Woore, officer of exci&s;e at Crief,
on occa&s;ion of &s;omething relative to his duty in the gauging
of malt liquors, which belonged to the pannel's ma&s;ter.
And having learned that he was to pa&s;s by a certain way
under cloud of night, he &s;olicited &s;everal per&s;ons, and prevail|ed
with three of them, to go along with him, and lie in wait
by the &s;ide of the way, (as he expre&s;&s;ed it), <HI>&startq;to cuff the gauger.&endq;</HI>
They went out accordingly, all of them provided with &s;ticks
only, though other weapons might ea&s;ily have been procu|red.
And having met with Woore, they pulled him to the
ground from his hor&s;e, and there &s;everely beat the poor man,
on the head and &s;undry parts of the body, &s;o that he remain|ed
upon the road in&s;en&s;ible, and was next morning found
dead. It appears that Macfarlane in particular, reproached
one of the party for failing to u&s;e his &s;tick, and having pul|led
it out of his hand, returned and beat Woore a &s;econd time,
as he lay. The whole party, however, returned to the village
where they re&s;ided, and had liquor there from Macfarlane's
ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s, to whom he openly boa&s;ted of what he
had done, &s;aying, <HI>&startq;that he had cured the gauger of his gauging
for a week.&endq;</HI> He &s;lept too that night at home, and made
no attempt to e&s;cape. The&s;e and other circum&s;tances of
the &s;tory were made u&s;e of to &s;how, that the death of the
man was not within the compa&s;s of their project; whence
<PB N="398" REF="457">
it was argued, that only an arbitrary puni&s;hment could be in|flicted.
But the an&s;wer was thought good, that the pannel had
deliberately planned an exce&s;&s;ive and outrageous injury to the
per&s;on of the decea&s;ed; and as in the execution it had been pro|&s;ecuted
to the death of his victim, &s;o in the nature of things
it could not plainly appear, that at the moment of killing he
did not truly mean to de&s;troy: In the mo&s;t favourable view,
he was at lea&s;t re&s;olved on that which was to put the man
in imminent danger of his life; and he mu&s;t &s;tand there|fore
to the i&s;&s;ue of the hazard, which he had thus wicked|ly
brought on his neighbour. The defences were repelled,
and the beating, even without the way-laying, was found re|levant
to infer the highe&s;t pains. The fact was fully pro|ved;
and the pannel had &s;entence of death<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">November 28. 1737. &startq;Find that Dougal Macfarlane pannel having time and place libelled way-laid the decea&s;ed J. Woore, officer of exci&s;e, and meeting with him, did, with a rung or large &s;tick, beat him, whereby the &s;aid J. W. did &s;oon thereafter die; <HI>or</HI> that he the &s;aid pannell did time and place fore&s;aid, with repeated &s;trokes of a rung or large &s;tick, beat the &s;aid decea&s;ed J.

<P>ANOTHER ca&s;e of the &s;ame &s;tamp,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Animus occiden|di,</HI> how far e&s;|&s;ential.</NOTE> and which was decided
on the &s;ame principle, is that of David Hume, tried in Octo|ber
1723. This man, along with two more, of the name
of Sinclair, had conceived a grudge again&s;t John Hor&s;ely
and others, Engli&s;hmen, and &s;ervants of the York-buildings
Company on their e&s;tate of Winton, who had reproved them
<PB N="399" REF="458">
for pa&s;&s;ing through the inclo&s;ures without leave. They
were heard, without much re&s;erve, to threaten mi&s;chief to
<HI>the Engli&s;hmen,</HI> and to &s;ay, that they &s;hould be for ever <HI>af|fronted,</HI>
if they had not amends of them. One evening, in
the du&s;k, they accordingly lay in wait, by a wall near the
hou&s;e of Seaton, and &s;et upon and beat one of Hor&s;ely's
&s;ervants, who had come out to draw water; and on his gi|ving
the alarm, and another coming out, they &s;et upon and
beat him al&s;o, with rungs and &s;taves, in &s;uch a manner that
he died. There was nothing in the&s;e circum&s;tances to in|dicate
a formed purpo&s;e of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination: But the Court not|with&s;tanding,
as in the other ca&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 9. &amp; 16. 1723.</NOTE> found, &startq;That David
Home pannel having at the time and place libelled, beat or
wounded George Sweet &s;ervant to John Hor&s;ely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or
of Seaton, of which &s;trokes or wounds the &s;aid George
Sweet did &s;oon thereafter die, relevant to infer the pain of
death, and con&s;i&s;cation of moveables.&endq; The pannel, how|ever,
was not convicted.</P>
<P>I SHALL only take notice of one ca&s;e more, an old ca&s;e,
and one of much malignity and cruelty, but in which the
pannel cannot be &s;aid to have had an ab&s;olute purpo&s;e to
de&s;troy. I allude to the ca&s;e of Patrick Stewart,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 3. 1602.</NOTE> who having
conceived great malice at Angus Maciver, on &s;u&s;picion of
unlawful intercour&s;e with his daughter, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his
per&s;on, bound him hand and foot, cut off his privy member,
and put hot a&s;hes in the <HI>&s;crotum,</HI> and then carried him on
hor&s;eback to a hou&s;e at &s;ome di&s;tance, where in a few days
he died. Stewart was convicted and beheaded.</P>
<P>THUS it appears,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lethal Weapon, if e&s;&s;ential to the Charge.</NOTE> that it would be fruitle&s;s to &s;et on foot
an inquiry, in which however &s;ome commentators have em|ployed
much time and labour, concerning the nature of the
<PB N="400" REF="459">
&s;everal weapons, what are, and what are not to be repu|ted
lethal. Thus far there is a difference in weapons, that
there be &s;ome, &s;uch as &s;words and fire-arms, which carry
ab&s;olute and uncontroulable evidence of the mortal purpo&s;e,
in every ca&s;e where they are u&s;ed; and in this &s;en&s;e it may
be not improper to di&s;tingui&s;h the&s;e as lethal. But that
there is any weapon of &s;o harmle&s;s a kind, that in every
ca&s;e, and in all circum&s;tances, it mu&s;t be held to have been
u&s;ed without a mortal purpo&s;e; this is an ab&s;urdity in it&s;elf,
and cannot be maintained without a plain perver&s;ion of the
term. The an&s;wer is, that the weapon mu&s;t be lethal, by
which a man has died; that a man was actually killed with
this weapon, in this ca&s;e; and that whether it was or was
not u&s;ed with a mortal or highly injurious purpo&s;e, is a
matter which cannot be determined on bare &s;ight of the wea|pon,
but on the way of u&s;ing it, the repetition of the blows,
the comparative age and &s;trength of parties, the words ut|tered
on the occa&s;ion, and all other particulars of the
&s;tory. Wherein, if on the whole there be evidence of a
mortal or very malignant purpo&s;e, the circum&s;tance of an
unlikely weapon may be outweighed, like any other. That
weapon has actually killed; it might be intended &s;o to do;
and it mu&s;t be &s;hewn <HI>idoneis argumentis,</HI> on the part of the pan|nel,
that this was not the ca&s;e. For this rule we may quote
the Divine law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Numbers, c. 35. ver. 16. 18. 21.</NOTE> by which he who &s;mites with a throwing
&s;tone, or with a hand-weapon of wood, wherewith a per&s;on
may die, is to be held a murderer, and to be put to death.
And again, &s;till more explicitly, &startq;if in enmity he &s;mite
him with his hand, that he die, he that &s;mote him &s;hall
&s;urely be put to death, for he is a murderer.&endq;</P>

which it were equally tedious as u&s;ele&s;s to recite. On the

for the murder of his wife, and a child in her womb, done
by &s;triking her with his foot on the belly, and with a &s;wingle|tree
on the back; of which &s;trokes &s;he and the child imme|diately
died.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 1. 1613.</NOTE> Libel was found relevant again&s;t Hugh Som|merville,

libel relates that he a&s;&s;aulted John Love, &startq;&s;ei&s;ing him by
the hair of the head, and giving him &s;everal blows,
brui&s;es and wounds on the face or head, whereupon he called

langui&s;hed for two or three days and died<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The libel is &s;ilent as to the weapon with which the blows were given. But it is clear from the debate that they were given with the fi&s;t. The &s;ame appears from the proof; though &s;ome of the by&s;tanders &s;u&s;pected that the pannel had &s;omething hard concealed within his hand. But this is neither &s;aid nor in&s;inu|ated in the libel.</NOTE>.&endq; The libel

<P>ONE thing is to be ob&s;erved of all ca&s;es where no in&s;tru|ment
but the hand is u&s;ed, that if the pannel, before &s;triking,
have &s;uffered any real provocation, this will materially affect
the con&s;truction of his deed. If John without cau&s;e a&s;&s;ault
James, and violently and for a length of time beat him
with the fi&s;t, &s;o that he dies; the law can pre&s;ume no
other, but that he a&s;&s;aults with the wicked intent to do
&s;ome great bodily harm. But if he only &s;trike in retali|ation
of a &s;evere blow, this will not be murder, though
James die; becau&s;e the provocation excludes the &s;uppo|&s;ition
of malignity. He intends indeed to hurt; but, be|ing
a&s;&s;aulted in this manner, he is entitled to re&s;ent, as far
at lea&s;t as goes to a few blows with the hand; and if
the&s;e are attended with any danger of James's life, he
is him&s;elf alone to blame for the event. In &s;hort, with re|gard
to any act which a per&s;on hath right to do, law will
pre&s;ume on his &s;ide while it can, that he does not intend the
<PB N="405" REF="464">
great and unlikely evil which en&s;ues; but will require evi|dence
again&s;t him, of one kind or other, that he means to kill
or to do &s;ome outrageous harm.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maclaurin, No. 81. and p. 517.</NOTE> The ca&s;e of Archibald was
of this de&s;cription. It was &s;hortly thus: that in the cour&s;e

on the head, to the &s;urpri&s;e of the by&s;tanders, and in &s;uch a
manner, of which even on opening the head, no &s;atisfac|tory
account could be obtained. It was evident on the
whole circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, that there was no mortal,
nor even highly injurious purpo&s;e on the part of the pannel;
and as he had received &s;uch provocation of blows from
the decea&s;ed, as in the opinion of the jury entitled him to
&s;trike in the way he did, they found him not guilty of
the charge.</P>
<P>ON review of the&s;e judgments,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Outrageous Pur|po&s;e, if e&s;&s;ential to the Charge.</NOTE> it may perhaps be thought
of &s;ome of them, that they are incon&s;i&s;tent with others,
formerly mentioned, by which the relevancy was confined to
an arbitrary puni&s;hment; and that in particular there is this
repugnancy between the ca&s;e of Aird in 1693, and of Rey|&s;ano
in 1724, who e&s;caped with tran&s;portation, although,
like Aird, he had killed by pu&s;hing the per&s;on backwards,
down &s;tairs. But if the circum&s;tances of the two ca&s;es
be duly weighed, the judgments will appear to be nowi&s;e
incon&s;i&s;tent, or rather to be an apt illu&s;tration of the
doctrine which we have in hand. In Rey&s;ano's ca&s;e the
parties were men, and there was but one blow or pu&s;h given,
by which the decea&s;ed was thrown backwards, and at once
killed. Now this degree of violence might, and in it&s;elf was
rather pre&s;umable to be done, without a purpo&s;e to de&s;troy.
Whereas in Aird's ca&s;e, the repeated kicks, given by a man
to a woman, on the &s;ide, and the throwing of her down
<PB N="406" REF="465">
&s;tairs, together with the following of her, and the renewal of
the &s;ame abu&s;e of her per&s;on, after &s;he had been di&s;abled by &s;o
&s;evere a fall, left no doubt of a malignant and outrageous
purpo&s;e, if not to kill upon the &s;pot, at lea&s;t to do her &s;ome
dangerous and exce&s;&s;ive bodily harm. One convenient il|lu&s;tration
more of this di&s;tinction, is to be found in the pro|ceedings
on the charge again&s;t Jean Ram&s;ay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 24. 1713.</NOTE> for the mur|der
of a &s;ick and infirm per&s;on, who had ben found upon the
&s;treet, and carried into her habitation for a&s;&s;i&s;tance: &startq;The
Lords found the pannel's violently dragging the defunct,
a weak and infirm per&s;on, out of the bed on which he was
laid, &s;o that his head was bled on the bed-&s;tock or floor,
and her beating of him on the &s;ide with a pair of tongs,
and her <HI>again</HI> dragging him out of another bed whereon he
was afterwards laid, and his dying within a few hours
thereafter, about the time libelled, jointly relevant to
infer the pains of death and confi&s;cation of all goods and
gear; and found any of the fore&s;aid facts &s;eparately rele|vant
to infer an arbitrary puni&s;hment; and repelled the
haill defences proponed for the pannel.&endq; In this, the
Court required a reiterated dragging from the bed, to rai&s;e
the ca&s;e to murder. But the jury found as follows:
&startq;Find that part of the libel anent dragging a weak, &s;illy,
and infirm man out of bed, once in hou&s;e, upon a
che&s;t and floor, and thereby wounded and bled, and
that the &s;aid weak and infirm man was dead about eight
or nine of the clock next morning proven.&endq; Now,
on this verdict, as not e&s;tabli&s;hing the requi&s;ite degree of
violence, the pannel e&s;caped with &s;entence of &s;courging, and
bani&s;hment from the county of her re&s;idence.</P>
<P><PB N="407" REF="466">
I SHALL conclude this inquiry with a word or two concern|ing
one &s;ituation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;e of a Wo|man killed by Potion to pro|cure Abortion.</NOTE> which, though &s;omewhat different from the
others, &s;eems, however, fit to be governed by the &s;ame rule.
If a man admini&s;ter a potion to a woman without her know|ledge,
in order to procure abortion; and if the compo&s;ition
be of that powerful nature, as probably it will, to be attended
with a plain ri&s;k of life to the per&s;on who takes it, e&s;peci|ally
when it is taken in this unguarded manner; and if the
woman in con&s;equence die; this too &s;eems to be nothing le&s;s
than murder. Becau&s;e, though in a different way, he &s;hews
the &s;ame di&s;regard of her life and &s;afety, and expo&s;es her
to the &s;ame ri&s;k, as by doing outward violence to her per|&s;on.
A ca&s;e of this &s;ort was tried at Aberdeen on the 10th
May 1785; the ca&s;e of Robert Dalrymple a flax-dre&s;&s;er, and
Robert Joyner a druggi&s;t. The fact, as alleged, &s;eems to
have been, that the&s;e per&s;ons, having each of them a young
woman with child to him, they admini&s;tered &s;ome violent
drug to them without their knowledge, (as was &s;uppo&s;ed for
the purpo&s;e of procuring abortion), in con&s;equence of which
both the women died in the cour&s;e of the &s;ame night. The
libel was laid, without any mention of the &s;uppo&s;ed purpo&s;e of
the pre&s;cription, as for murder by poi&s;on, with an alterna|tive
of culpable homicide. The Court found it relevant to
infer the pains of law. Joyner was outlawed; and the libel
was found <HI>not proven</HI> again&s;t Dalrymple.</P>
<P>VII. THESE &s;eem to be &s;ome of the mo&s;t material con&s;i|derations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Art and Part of Murder.</NOTE>
towards a&s;certaining the de&s;cription of the crime
of murder. I will now &s;ubmit what has occurred to me,
concerning the &s;everal ways wherein a per&s;on may be art and
part of murder, and liable to the proper pains of that crime,
though the &s;laughter is not the immediate act of his own
<PB N="408" REF="467">
hand. This may either be by &s;ome part taken in the
perpetration of the deed, or by &s;omething done in prepa|ration
or furtherance of the future act; for all the&s;e &s;everal
modes enter into the compo&s;ition of our phra&s;e of art and
part. It is with re&s;pect to the fir&s;t &s;ort of acce&s;&s;ion, that
the mo&s;t frequent, though not perhaps the mo&s;t difficult
que&s;tions of art and part ari&s;e. Yet even here ca&s;es of &s;ome
nicety may happen. For according to the views with which
the &s;everal per&s;ons meet, the &s;hare which they re&s;pectively
take in the doing of the deed, the certainty or uncertainty
of the mortal blow, and &s;undry other circum&s;tances, they
may be all in the &s;ame or in very different degrees of guilt,
and may de&s;erve higher or lower pains, or perhaps &s;ome of
them be entirely free of the crime.</P>
<P>1. ONE thing is plainly rea&s;onable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Art and Part by Pre&s;ence.</NOTE> and among all au|thorities
agreed. That if a number con&s;pire and lie in
wait, to kill a certain per&s;on, &startq;<HI>&s;i plures, non per rixae oc|ca&s;ionem,
&s;ed premeditato concilio, in necem alicujus conjura|verint,</HI>&endq;
it &s;ignifies nothing by whom the mortal blows
are given, nor how few of them there be. Though but one
of the party &s;trike, and di&s;patch with one blow of a lethal
weapon, he is not therefore the one actor on the occa&s;ion,
but executioner, for all of them, of their common re&s;olu|tion:
properly &s;peaking he is their in&s;trument with which
they &s;trike, and they by their pre&s;ence are con&s;enting, aid|ing,
and abetting to him in all that he doth; having all of
them come thither on purpo&s;e to have it done, and being rea|dy
to lend their aid, if need &s;hall be. Their pre&s;ence on the
occa&s;ion is &s;ub&s;tantially an a&s;&s;i&s;tance. It adds to the terror,
confu&s;ion, and danger of the decea&s;ed, who again&s;t the a&s;|&s;ault
of one only, without the appearance of company or
<PB N="409" REF="468">
&s;upport, might chance &s;ucce&s;sfully to defend him&s;elf; as on
the other &s;ide the invader is heartened in the enterpri&s;e, by
his knowledge of the force provided to &s;u&s;tain him. James
Shaw had &s;entence of death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 10. 1673.</NOTE> on a verdict which &s;pecifies
his pre&s;ence at the murder, as the main ground of con|viction<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">&startq;Find, by his own judicial confe&s;&s;ion of his being pre&s;ent at the &s;aid murder, and other pre&s;umptions, that he had acce&s;&s;ion thereto, and was guilty of art and part of the murder.&endq;</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS rule is to be under&s;tood,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Art and Part by Pre&s;ence.</NOTE> not only of tho&s;e (com|paratively
rare) ca&s;es, where an expre&s;s and formal com|pact
to kill can be proved, but equally of all, in which
from the number, arms, or behaviour and language of the
per&s;ons engaged, an implied and tacit confederacy may
rea&s;onably be gathered. And with re&s;pect to the pre&s;ence
of any a&s;&s;ociate; in this article al&s;o, I do not mean to
&s;peak of real only and phy&s;ical pre&s;ence, by &s;eeing the deed
done, but of that con&s;tructive pre&s;ence which is &s;u&s;tained by
the law in many other ca&s;es; and according to which every
per&s;on &s;hall be held to be pre&s;ent, who in any &s;hape co-ope|rates
in, facilitates, or protects the actual execution of the
&s;laughter. One, for in&s;tance, gives notice of the per&s;on's ap|proach
by &s;ignal from a di&s;tance; a &s;econd, di&s;patches him at
a &s;pot agreed on; and a third, takes po&s;t at a convenient
place to prevent interruption, or favour their e&s;cape: Cer|tainly
all the three are in one degree of guilt. By the con|&s;truction
of law, they are all pre&s;ent, and participant of the
murder; becau&s;e at the time of doing it, they are each of
them in his place, lending effectual aid to the perpetration
<PB N="410" REF="469">
of the deed; and but for this mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance and encou|ragement,
the attempt might not be made.</P>
<P>IT is al&s;o to be ob&s;erved,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Art and Part by Pre&s;ence.</NOTE> with re&s;pect to this rule of con|victing
on the ground of &s;imple pre&s;ence, that it is not con|fined
to tho&s;e ca&s;es, where the murder is committed with
the proper in&s;truments of &s;laughter. It is true, that where the
whole party are equipped in that fa&s;hion, at &s;etting out on
the enterpri&s;e, or where &s;ome of them provide them&s;elves
with arms, with the knowledge and con&s;ent of the others,
tho&s;e circum&s;tances are them&s;elves evidence of the a&s;&s;ent of
all of them to the felonious and mortal purpo&s;e. And it
mu&s;t be granted, that if the decea&s;ed is not di&s;patched in
this manner, but by beating with a &s;taff or the like; here,
with re&s;pect to any one who has not actually &s;truck, (for
there is not otherwi&s;e any room for &s;uch a que&s;tion), the
&s;tronger proof will be required of his full a&s;&s;ociation to the
previous confederacy, and of the high and dangerous nature
of the intended injury, or of his actual a&s;&s;ent to what he
&s;ees done at the time: or at lea&s;t, the ca&s;e will be more
open to a proof of favourable circum&s;tances on his part; as
that he remon&s;trated with his a&s;&s;ociates, and did what in
him lay to re&s;train them from any dangerous exce&s;s. In the
ca&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 16. 1723.</NOTE> accordingly, of David Hume, which was of this pre|ci&s;e
de&s;cription; the &s;laughter having been done in the pre|&s;ence
of three per&s;ons, by beating the decea&s;ed with &s;taves;
the Court, after hearing a full argument, found a relevancy
on the actual beating only by Hume, and not as libelled and
in&s;i&s;ted for, on the beating by him, or by the other per&s;ons
in his pre&s;ence. The rea&s;on was, that no &s;trong circum|&s;tances
were laid in the libel, to infer his knowledge of any
felonious con&s;piracy to de&s;troy or maim; and that the cau&s;e
<PB N="411" REF="470">
of quarrel was the affair of the other per&s;ons, rather than
his<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">&startq;The Lords find, that David Home, pannell, having at the time and place lybelled, beat and wounded George Sweet, &s;ervant to John Hor&s;ely, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of Seton, of which &s;troaks or wounds, he the &s;aid George Sweet did &s;oon thereafter dye, relevant to infer the pain of death, and confi&s;cation of move|ables.&endq;</NOTE>. But &s;till the difference between &s;uch ca&s;es, and that
of &s;laughter with the proper in&s;truments of death, lies in the
matter of proof only, and no deeper. For if &s;atisfactory
evidence be obtained of a deliberate plan to way-lay the de|cea&s;ed,
and to kill, or to maim and di&s;able him, by an out|rageous
beating; certainly, in the event of his death, this is
murder in all who are participant of that purpo&s;e, and &s;tand
by to &s;ee it executed, approving, or not interpo&s;ing to hin|der
the continuance of the outrage.</P>
<P>AFTER what has been &s;aid of &s;imple pre&s;ence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Art and Part by A&s;&s;i&s;tance in the Act.</NOTE> it is need|le&s;s
to enlarge on tho&s;e circum&s;tances in the conduct of the
per&s;ons pre&s;ent, which &s;hall be held to prove their a&s;&s;ent to
the deed, or to amount to an a&s;&s;i&s;tance. In general, all &s;uch
behaviour as tends to impede, di&s;concert, or intimidate the de|cea&s;ed,
in his defence, is as deci&s;ive again&s;t the pannel, as the
&s;triking of a &s;evere blow, or the doing of a direct injury to the
per&s;on.<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 14. 1676.</NOTE> Thus in the ca&s;e of David Hamilton of Auchtoul,
accu&s;ed of the murder of Mair of Milntown<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot"><P>This was a very cruel and unnatural ca&s;e. The pannel and Mair were near relations. His &s;on, Gavin Hamilton, &s;ends Mair a written challenge, and goes to the field, provided with a hor&s;e and other equipment to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his flight, if need &s;hall be. Mean while, David, the father, goes to Mair's hou&s;e, (who was a lad of nineteen), and by threats and in&s;ults, draws him to the field to fight, though reluctant. When arrived there, the other per&s;ons pre&s;ent endeavour to make peace between the parties; but David Hamilton in&s;i&s;ts that they &s;hall fight, and &s;ets them to.

But the father &s;ucceeds in again &s;etting them to, and &s;trikes Mair on the &s;ide, as he is retiring, and tumbles him down. Having then got to the right of him, as he lay on the ground, &s;o as to hinder his free u&s;e of his &s;word, he thus gives an opportunity to Gavin, who thru&s;ts at Mair, under his father's arm and kills him.

The Court found it &startq;relevant to be proven, that the pannel, after he &s;aw his &s;on Gilbert, with his &s;word drawn, did beat or &s;trike the defunct with his &s;tick or &s;taff. or that the pannel immediately &s;truck the defunct with his cane before the mortal thru&s;t, &s;o that the defunct's di&s;order by the &s;aid &s;trokes did hinder him to defend him&s;elf again&s;t the thru&s;t.&endq; But this only to the effect of inflicting an arbitrary pain. The ground of this re&s;triction was, that the pannel Robert Ken|nedy, and the decea&s;ed were, at the time when the &s;on drew his &s;word and killed, actually engaged in the heat and pa&s;&s;ion of a &s;cuffle, in which they mutually beat each other with canes: So that there could hardly be evidence that the father, in this agitation, had &s;o thoroughly under&s;tood and entered into his &s;on's purpo&s;e of killing, as to make him an a&s;&s;ociate therein. The father might de&s;i&s;t as &s;oon as he &s;aw the &s;word drawn, and yet the thru&s;t follow &s;o quickly, that the decea|&s;ed could not recover from his di&s;order; or he might &s;trike after &s;eeing it drawn, not conceiving that the &s;on meant to kill, but only to &s;eparate them, or to pro|tect his father by the &s;how of the weapon. It was thus a quite different ca&s;e, from that of interpo&s;ing to &s;trike one of two per&s;ons, already engaged in a mortal combat. It rather appears from the proof, that the pannel's back was turned to his &s;on at the time he drew, and that the pannel did not ob&s;erve it. The jury found to that effect, and he was a&s;&s;oilzied.</P></NOTE>, the Court
<PB N="412" REF="471">
finds the libel bearing the pannel's murdering and &s;laying
the defunct relevant; <HI>as al&s;o,</HI> that the pannel came to the

Reference may al&s;o be made to the ca&s;e of Davis and Wilt|&s;hire,
in March 1740. The&s;e were two &s;oldiers of a party,
who irregularly, and of their own authority, had &s;topped a
cart as loaded with &s;muggled wine. In the ab&s;ence of the
others, who had gone to inform the revenue officer, a &s;cuffle
aro&s;e between the pannels and the driver, in&s;i&s;ting to drive
off his cart. In the cour&s;e of this conte&s;t, the carter wre&s;ted
the mu&s;ket from Wilt&s;hire, who thereupon cried to Davis to
fire; which Davis did, and killed the carter. The verdict
<PB N="414" REF="473">
was thus: &startq;Find it proven, that Thomas Davis pannel,
di&s;charged a firelock at the decea&s;ed John Mather, where|by
he received a mortal wound, of which he &s;oon there|after
died; and finds it likewi&s;e proven, that Charles
Wilt&s;hire, the other pannel, de&s;ired the &s;aid Thomas Da|vis
to fire; but does not find the exculpation proven.&endq; Af|ter
hearing an argument on this verdict, the Court pronoun|ced
&s;entence of death on both the pannels.</P>
<P>2. WHAT has been &s;aid of &s;laughter committed in pur&s;u|ance
of a concert to kill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art and Part of Murder done in purinance of another Felony.</NOTE> or to do &s;ome grievous bodily harm,
&s;eems to be equally true of &s;laughter done in pro&s;ecution of
any other felony; provided the nature of the attempt im|ply,
or the behaviour and proceedings of the parties indi|cate,
an unity of purpo&s;e in all concerned, and a re&s;olu|tion
to controul all re&s;i&s;tance of their enterpri&s;e by force.
If &s;everal go out together, armed, to rob on the highway,
and one of them kill in the a&s;&s;ault, it is murder in all tho&s;e
of the party who are anywi&s;e aiding in this robbery, whe|ther
pre&s;ent on the &s;pot or not. For they are all there under
a compact of mutual &s;upport; and the &s;laughter is an obvious
and not unfore&s;een con&s;equence of the a&s;&s;ault, to rob: el&s;e
why go they out provided with arms? The like judgment
will be due, if a number be engaged in a hou&s;e-breaking, and
one of them kill a per&s;on in the hou&s;e, whether to &s;ubdue
re&s;i&s;tance or make good his e&s;cape: even tho&s;e who ne|ver
enter the hou&s;e, but only watch without, to prevent &s;ur|pri&s;e,
are here guilty of the murder. Or again; put
the ca&s;e that a &s;core of per&s;ons have a&s;&s;embled to re&s;cue a
cargo of &s;muggled goods, which are in the cour&s;e of con|veyance
by the revenue-officer, and that they proceed for
this purpo&s;e, all or mo&s;t of them provided with fire-arms. If,
<PB N="415" REF="474">
in the pro&s;ecution of this felonious enterpri&s;e, the revenue|officer
or any of his party be killed, all the confederates
are an&s;werable for it with their lives. For why come
they there armed, and in numbers, but in the expectation of
re&s;i&s;tance, and in preparation to overcome it? All are
there at the time in a mutual league of defence and &s;up|port,
by force of arms, in their unlawful project; and
it is by the deed of all and each of them, in pur&s;uit of
their common object, that the immediate actor has been
brought into that &s;ituation which has tempted him to kill. It
is on their account, as much as his own, that he has made u&s;e
of his arms. He does &s;o, to protect their per&s;ons, and promote
their enterpri&s;e, in which he has no deeper intere&s;t than the
others, and which, if he were left &s;ingle, he would certainly
abandon. Were it not for their company, he would not be
on the expedition; if others had not brought arms with
them, neither would he; and it is to their power, and their
di&s;po&s;ition to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, that he tru&s;ts when he makes u&s;e of
his weapon.</P>
<P>STATING the ca&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art and Part of Murder done in a great A&s;&s;em|bly.</NOTE> however, of a very numerous a&s;&s;em|bly;
it is more e&s;pecially nece&s;&s;ary to attend to the terms
in which our rule has been guarded, namely, that the a&s;|&s;embly
be of that kind, in which a plain unity of pur|po&s;e
and temper of mind may be ob&s;erved. For otherwi&s;e;
as in the ca&s;e of a great mob, or riotous convocation, which
con&s;i&s;ts of per&s;ons who a&s;&s;emble from different quarters,
without previous concert, and variou&s;ly equipped, as well as in
various tempers of mind, and for objects of very different
degrees of guilt, ju&s;tice requires an inve&s;tigation of the con|duct
of each individual; in order that a judgment may be
formed with re&s;pect to him, according to the &s;tyle of his
<PB N="416" REF="475">
equipment, the language he holds, and the part he acts on
the occa&s;ion, whether he is to be deemed an accomplice in
any &s;laughter which en&s;ues, or not. It is indeed true, that in
the ca&s;e of James Learmonth and William Temple,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 11. &amp; 13. 1678.</NOTE> the one
circum&s;tance of pre&s;ence in arms at a very numerous meet|ing
where a man was killed, &s;eems to have been judged a
&s;ufficient ground of conviction<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Interlocutor. &startq;The Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners of Ju&s;ticiary having con&s;idered the libel and debate, find the libel, reply, and triply proponed by his Maje&s;ty's Advocate, <HI>viz.</HI> pre&s;ence at the unlawful meeting of the field coventicle libel|led, with arms, at which the &s;laughter was committed; <HI>or</HI> giving coun&s;el or command in the words conde&s;cended upon in the debat&eacute;, <HI>viz.</HI> &lsquo;Let there be no cowards here the day, Sirs, and let the&s;e that have arms go out be$ore,&rsquo; or the like expre&s;&s;ions, relevant; and remits the &s;ame to the knowledge of the a&s;&s;ize.&endq;</NOTE>, as art and part of the
&s;laughter. And ca&s;es may double&s;s be imagined, where &s;uch
a judgment &s;hall be unexceptionable; the ca&s;e, for in&s;tance
of a trea&s;onable ri&s;ing in arms. Becau&s;e the in&s;urgents
are combined on the preci&s;e principle, of executing their
purpo&s;e by force and &s;laughter; &s;o that all who are in
the field in arms, are art and part of all the depreda|tions,
&s;laughters, and other mi&s;chiefs attending on the &s;tate
of war, that are committed in their pre&s;ence. It may
al&s;o be &s;uitable to &s;uch a ca&s;e as that of the Porteous mob;
in which, to the tumult and di&s;order; there was joined a
pointed and &s;pecial purpo&s;e of revenge and &s;laughter again&s;t
a certain per&s;on; whereof all who came equipped and a&s;|&s;i&s;ted
with arms, might rea&s;onably be held to be partakers.
But the charge in the ca&s;e of Learmonth and Temple was
thus. That they and their accomplices, to the number at
lea&s;t of a thou&s;and, and many of them armed, had a&s;&s;em|bled
for a field preaching or conventicle, on the hills of
<PB N="417" REF="476">
Whitekirk, within &s;ight of his Maje&s;ty's garri&s;on of the
Ba&s;s; and that the governor of that place having &s;ent out a
party of &s;oldiers again&s;t them, they treacherou&s;ly, after
promi&s;ing to di&s;per&s;e, had &s;et upon the party, &s;ome of
whom they wounded, and killed one. It appears that this
per&s;on was killed with a &s;ingle blow of a halbert; and it was
not alleged, that either of the pannels &s;truck the blow, or
invaded the man. Now on &s;uch an occa&s;ion as this, per&s;ons
might be pre&s;ent in arms from very different motives; &s;ome
in con&s;equence only of the fa&s;hion of the times to wear
arms, &s;ome for &s;elf-defence in ca&s;e of per&s;onal a&s;&s;ault on
them&s;elves, others <HI>in terrorem,</HI> to prevent di&s;turbance by the
&s;how of force, and a few perhaps with ho&s;tile purpo&s;es, and
prepared for &s;laughter on any mole&s;tation. The mere pre|&s;ence
in the conventicle with arms, was, however, explicitly
found relevant to infer guilt of the &s;laughter. Learmonth
was convicted of exhorting to re&s;i&s;tance, and had &s;entence
of death. Temple was convicted of pre&s;ence with a &s;word,
but undrawn, near the &s;pot where the &s;laughter was commit|ted;
and he only e&s;caped the capital puni&s;hment which would
have followed in terms of the interlocutor, owing to inter|ce&s;&s;ion
made for him with the Lords of Privy Council. But
this is a precedent taken from an arbitrary period, and rela|tive
to an offence in which the State took a great and un|due
concern; be&s;ide that the judgment appears to have
been much commented on, even at the time when it was
given<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Fountainhall's acount of this ca&s;e, vol. i. p. 12. 13. Al&s;o Mackenzie's Vindication of Charles ll.'s Government.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN every thing that has been &s;aid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What if Slaugh|ter, not in pur|&s;uance of the common Object.</NOTE> this limitation is implied,
That to affect all concerned, the &s;laughter mu&s;t be done in

pur&s;uance of the common enterpri&s;e, in which the party are
engaged. For if it be done on &s;ome peculiar and accidental
quarrel of the &s;layer, which is not connected with nor &s;ub|&s;ervient
to the original de&s;ign.; or, though it have &s;ome re|lation
to that de&s;ign, if a re&s;olution of the whole party
to accompli&s;h their object by &s;uch extreme means, cannot
rea&s;onably be collected in the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e;
in either of the&s;e &s;ituations all the rea&s;ons entirely fail, upon
which, by the con&s;truction of law, the act of one is carried
over into the per&s;ons of his a&s;&s;ociates. Such a ca&s;e is that
mentioned by Fo&s;ter<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Crown Law, p. 313.</NOTE>, of three &s;oldiers who went out together,
to rob an orchard. Two got upon a pear-tree, and the third
&s;tood at the gate, with a drawn &s;word in his hand. The
owner's &s;on, coming by, collared the man at the gate, and a&s;k|ed
him what bu&s;ine&s;s he had there; and thereupon the &s;oldier
&s;tabbed him. It was ruled by Holt, that this was murder
in him who &s;tabbed, but that tho&s;e on the tree were inno|cent.
They came to commit a &s;mall incon&s;iderable tre&s;pa&s;s,
and the man was killed on a &s;udden affray, without their
knowledge. It would, (&s;aid that able Judge,) have been
otherwi&s;e, if they had all come thither with a general re&s;o|lution
again&s;t all oppo&s;ers.</P>
<P>3. THE more ordinary ca&s;e of &s;laughter is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art and Part in Ca&s;es of &s;udden Slaughter.</NOTE> that the felo|nious
purpo&s;e is taken up on a &s;udden, upon fortuitous quar|rel
among per&s;ons who were lawfully a&s;&s;embled for &s;ome
other object. And, in the&s;e circum&s;tances, to convict any one
as art and part of the &s;laughter, evidence mu&s;t be &s;hown with
relation to him in particular, of &s;uch things done by him
as infer his adoption of the mortal purpo&s;e, and amount to the
rendering of a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the execution of it. On the 1&s;t
<PB N="419" REF="478">
of April 1691, Captain Bruce and Lieutenant Arrot were
brought to trial, on charge of a tumultuous attack made by
them, along with others, on the city-guard of Edinburgh,
at their guard-hou&s;e, in the cour&s;e of which three &s;oldiers
of the guard were killed. This was the i&s;&s;ue of an acci|dental
&s;quabble with the guard, on the King's birth-day,
when bonfires were kindled, and the pannels, along with
other per&s;ons in liquor, were roaming through the &s;treets, in
a di&s;orderly manner, in the evening. It was thus obvious
that many might be pre&s;ent, and even in &s;ome mea&s;ure en|gaged
in the affray, out of curio&s;ity or indi&s;cretion, or at the
wor&s;t with no more criminal purpo&s;e than that of rai&s;ing a
brawl in the &s;treet; and the Court thought it therefore ju&s;t
to require evidence with re&s;pect to each of the pannels, of
his joining in the mortal a&s;&s;ault, by thru&s;ting at the guard
with a drawn &s;word<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">April 2. 1691. &startq;Find the libel anent the &s;laughter of the &s;aid Henry Lincklatur relevant again&s;t Lieutenant David Arrot allenarly; and find the &s;aid libel as to the &s;laughter of Alexander Simp&s;on and Colin Campbell relevant again&s;t both the pannels; and finds the &s;aid Lieutenant David Arrot his thru&s;t|ing at the guard with a drawn &s;word, relevant to infer art and part again&s;t him as to the &s;laughter of the &s;aids three haill per&s;ons killed; and finds Captain James Bruce his thru&s;ting at the guard with a drawn &s;word, relevant to infer art and part again&s;t him as to the &s;laughter of Alexander Simp&s;on and Colin Camp|bell allenarly.&endq;</NOTE>. Nearly the &s;ame rule was followed
in the ca&s;e of Captain John Price and five others:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 24. 1690.</NOTE> of whom
the libel relates, that being in a tavern they quarrelled with
the people of the hou&s;e, who &s;ent for the guard to quell
them; whereupon they &s;uddenly took up a purpo&s;e of re|&s;i&s;tance,
&s;hut the door of the hou&s;e, and drew their &s;words
on the &s;oldiers of the guard. At length, as the corporal
of the guard was entering, (having forced open the door),
<PB N="420" REF="479">
he was &s;hot through the head by one or other of the party.
Here too the Court con&s;idered, that the pannels were inno|cently
a&s;&s;embled at fir&s;t, and that &s;ome of the party might re|main
in the hou&s;e rather from fear of the others, or want
of opportunity to retire, than from any concurrence in the
felonious purpo&s;e of re&s;i&s;tance. They therefore required
evidence with regard to each, of his co-operation in the fe|lony,
by &s;triking at the guard, or otherwi&s;e oppo&s;ing them,
or at lea&s;t having his &s;word drawn again&s;t them<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">November 26. 1690. &startq;The Lords find the libel anent the &s;laughter of the &s;aid decea&s;ed John <HI>Real,</HI> and the pannels their being art and part thereof, by each of them their &s;triking at the guard. re&s;i&s;ting or oppo&s;ing them, or having drawn &s;words or pi&s;tols in their hands, rele$ant to infer the pams of death.&endq;</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN the&s;e in&s;tances,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art and Part in Ca&s;es of &s;udden Slaughter.</NOTE> it was unknown by who&s;e hand the
mortal blow had been given. But in the circum&s;tances of
the fact, this uncertainty could not yield an argument for
mitigating the puni&s;hment of any one of the pannels, again&s;t
whom &s;uch a co-operation was proved. Becau&s;e, in employ|ing
the proper in&s;truments of &s;laughter, they had all &s;ub|&s;tantially,
though on a &s;udden, adopted the felonious pur|po&s;e;
were actuated by the &s;ame malignity; exerted them|&s;elves to one end; and effectually a&s;&s;i&s;ted the mortal
hand, whichever it was, by their combined attack; which
materially affected the terror of the decea&s;ed, and his a|bility
to defend him&s;elf at the time. By whom the fa|tal
blow was given, was indifferent in &s;uch a ca&s;e, and
if known could not tend in any mea&s;ure to relieve the
others; &s;ince the deed was equally that of the whole party,
as if it had been done on a more regular and deliberate
a&s;&s;ociation. For with re&s;pect to a number of per&s;ons, as
with re&s;pect to one, it is immaterial as to the guilt of mur|der,
<PB N="421" REF="480">
(if there be no &s;ufficient provocation in the ca&s;e), whe|ther
the mortal purpo&s;e is of malice aforethought, or is only
conceived upon the &s;pot. The deed in the ca&s;e mentioned,
was therefore that of all who a&s;&s;ailed with mortal weapons.
It has been &s;een, that in the ca&s;e of Davis and Wilt&s;hire,
a &s;imple command or exhortation to fire was held to be re|levant
again&s;t Wilt&s;hire: much more would it have been &s;o,
if Wilt&s;hire had thru&s;t with his bayonet, or had fired his
piece, though the mortal injury was done by Davis.</P>
<P>THE other &s;ide of the rule is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art and Part in Ca&s;es of &s;udden Slaughter.</NOTE> that in &s;uch ca&s;es of &s;udden
&s;laughter, a per&s;on is not liable to any puni&s;hment, unle&s;s he
have in &s;ome mea&s;ure been active in the a&s;&s;ault. And in il|lu&s;trating this po&s;ition, I &s;hall con&s;ine my&s;elf to the &s;ingle
ca&s;e of Crief and Cordie, tried in February and March 1719.
The libel related, that the pannels, who were &s;oldiers, when
&s;tanding at the door of their quarters, had thrown out
foul language again&s;t the decea&s;ed, and others in his com|pany,
as they pa&s;&s;ed along the &s;treet; and that this being re|torted, the pannels proceeded to blows. The i&s;&s;ue was, that
one or other of them drew his bayonet, and gave a mortal
wound. The jury found that Cordie &s;tabbed, and that both
had given &s;currilous language<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">&startq;Found it proven, that Neil Cordie, one of the pannels, gave a thru&s;t with a drawn bayonet in his hand to John Ander&s;on, in his left &s;ide of which he died the next day; and al&s;o finds, that John Crief and Niel Cordie pannels, gave &s;currilous language to the &s;aid John Ander&s;on and his company, &s;uch as &s;aying,&mdash;There comes the blackguards and their whores.&endq; March 3. 1719.</NOTE>. Now, on this verdict Cordie
was adjudged to die, and Crief was a&s;&s;oilzied <HI>&s;impliciter;</HI> ha|ving

mortal purpo&s;e of his comrade.</P>
<P><PB N="422" REF="481">
THE cla&s;s of ca&s;es which naturally connect with the&s;e,
are ca&s;es of &s;laughter committed in a &s;udden brawl or &s;quab|le
among a number of per&s;ons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide <HI>in rixa per plures commi&s;&s;um.</HI></NOTE> and without employing

make mention of <HI>homicidium in rixa per plures commi&s;&s;um,</HI> as
liable only to an arbitrary puni&s;hment. The rea&s;ons of
&s;uch a doctrine, will be&s;t be under&s;tood by the putting of a
common ca&s;e; that two companies, both of them in liquor,
meet and quarrel on the &s;treets of a town, in the du&s;k of the
evening. Words pa&s;s at fir&s;t; and it &s;oon comes to blows,
(owing commonly to the fault of both &s;ides), with &s;uch in|&s;truments as the parties have upon them, or can lay hold of
at the time; and in this bu&s;tle a man is killed, it cannot be
&s;aid with certainty how, or by whom, but probably through
a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of injuries inflicted by &s;everal per&s;ons. In
the&s;e circum&s;tances, to puni&s;h every one capitally who is
proved to have &s;truck, or at all to have invaded the decea&s;ed,
would be an unju&s;t exce&s;s. Such a rule is indeed &s;uitable in
the ca&s;e of the deliberate way-laying of a &s;ingle per&s;on by a
number; becau&s;e each of the a&s;&s;ailants &s;ees, intends, and
mea&s;ures the violence that is offered by the others; and all
is done in the direct pro&s;ecution of one wilful plan, to put
the &s;ufferer in danger of his life. But in the ca&s;e now put,
where the meeting, the quarrel, and the violence, are all &s;ud|den
and fortuitous, and where the decea&s;ed him&s;elf is probably
in &s;ome mea&s;ure the cau&s;e of his own misfortune, the&s;e are
&s;trong con&s;iderations in favour of the pannels. In &s;uch
&s;ituations the combat goes on confu&s;edly, without any choice
of weapons or mea&s;ures, and as chance wills, rather than with
any &s;ort of conduct or guidance, and not only without any
<PB N="423" REF="482">
preci&s;e relation of the act of one to that of another, but
without any full knowledge on the part of any one of that
which the others have done; &s;o as he may judge of the danger
or exce&s;s. If indeed it can be &s;hown that the decea&s;ed was
de&s;troyed by a certain more &s;evere blow, given him by a par|ticular
per&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homicide <HI>in rixa per plures commi&s;&s;um.</HI></NOTE> this is quite a different ca&s;e, in which it will
become matter of &s;pecial inquiry with re&s;pect to that per|&s;on,
on the whole particulars of what he did, whether he
had a highly injurious purpo&s;e or not. But keeping to the
imagined ca&s;e; that the death is cau&s;ed by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of
injuries, or that the author of the mortal injury is unknown;
the re&s;ult can only be to inflict an arbitrary pain on tho&s;e
of the party who &s;truck the decea&s;ed, and entirely to ac|quit
the others, again&s;t whom no act of violence is proved.
One example of a homicide of this &s;ort, is the ca&s;e of George
Hutchie&s;on and others, Augu&s;t 12. 1784. The charge was,
that the pannel and others were a&s;&s;embled in a di&s;orderly
manner upon the &s;treet, where they in&s;ulted and mole&s;ted
pa&s;&s;engers; and that the decea&s;ed having interfered in be|half
of &s;ome one who was abu&s;ed, the pannels, &startq;all and
each, or one or other of them,&endq; gave him a mortal wound
on the head, with a &s;tone, &s;tick, iron-rake, or other offen|&s;ive
weapon, of which wound, after langui&s;hing about a
month, he died. The libel was laid as for homicide<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">&startq;Where, by the laws, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> homicide, or the killing and &s;laying any of the lieges, by beating or otherwi&s;e wounding them, &s;o as death follows; or the a&s;&s;aulting, brui&s;ing, or wounding any of the lieges to their bodily harm, to the effu&s;ion of their blood, and lo&s;s of their lives, in a violent, unlawful, and ma&s;tlerly manner; as al&s;o the riotou&s;ly and wantonly a&s;&s;embling on the &s;treets of a burgh, and beating of pa&s;&s;engers, and rai&s;ing di&s;turbances and quarrels therein, are all,&endq; <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>, and

one with a cane, the other with a broom-&s;taff, &s;o that
his &s;kull was fractured, and he died of the injury. The

The ca&s;e of Lind&s;ay and Brock, according to the &s;tory told
in the libel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 29. and Nov. 15. 1717.</NOTE> was preci&s;ely of that de&s;cription. They had
jo&s;tled Ander&s;on as he pa&s;&s;ed them on the &s;treet; and in con|&s;equence
a wre&s;tling took place, in which Ander&s;on was
thrown down, and the pannels came to the ground along with
him. Some &s;truggle followed with them in that &s;ituation;
and when Ander&s;on ro&s;e, he was &s;een to bleed profu&s;ely in
the neck, and was found to have received a deep cut
there, of which in a few minutes he died. The &s;heath of
a knife was found upon the &s;pot where they had fallen, and
there was blood upon the face of the one pannel, and upon
the hand of the other. But the knife it&s;elf was not found
upon either of them; nor had either of them been ob|&s;erved
to have &s;uch an in&s;trument in his hand, or upon him,
in the beginning of the quarrel. The verdict of the jury
entirely exculpated Brock; and an act of indemnity hin|dered
any judgment from pa&s;&s;ing on Lind&s;ay. But if con|viction
had been obtained in terms of the charge, the re|&s;ult
mu&s;t have been to inflict an arbitrary puni&s;hment on
both; by rea&s;on of the uncertainty of the per&s;on who
gave the mortal wound. That both &s;hould e&s;cape all pu|ni&s;hment
on that account, though it was certain that by
one or other of them the decea&s;ed had been <HI>feloniou&s;ly mur|dered,</HI>
would plainly have been unfit. And yet that both
&s;hould be puni&s;hed with death, would have been utterly
unju&s;t; &s;ince the mortal weapon had only been u&s;ed by one
of them, who had taken up the purpo&s;e in the cour&s;e of the
&s;truggle on the ground; and this, for any thing that could
be gathered from the circum&s;tances of the &s;ituation, with|out
even the knowledge, and much le&s;s the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the

4. THE mo&s;t favourable ca&s;e of any to the pannel, for the
con&s;truction of the&s;e que&s;tions of art and part,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art and Part of fortuitous Slaughter on a lawful Act.</NOTE> is where the
a&s;&s;embly is not only innocent, but for execution of the~ law,
and in obedience to its orders. If a magi&s;trate goes forth to
quell a tumult, and one of his <HI>po&s;&s;e,</HI> unnece&s;&s;arily, and without
orders, &s;trikes and kills; this is the peculiar act of the indivi|dual,
from which no manner of blame or re&s;pon&s;ibility at|taches
on the magi&s;trate, who&s;e purpo&s;e in going forth the
&s;laughter directly counteracts, by rai&s;ing a greater tumult.
This rule was applied in the ca&s;e of Mackinto&s;h and Fle|ming,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 9. 1673.</NOTE>
accu&s;ed of the &s;laughter of John and Robert Far|quhar&s;on.
Fleming's defence was, that the &s;laughter happen|ed
in the pro&s;ecution of a purpo&s;e to take the decea&s;ed with
caption; to which &s;ervice he being called, had attended as
a witne&s;s, but without being anywi&s;e active in the &s;laugh|ter.

pre&s;ence was not relevant<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">&startq;And as to the remanent di&s;pute again&s;t Fleming, the Lords find. That &s;imple pre&s;ence is not relevant again&s;t him; but &s;u&s;tains the libel again&s;t the &s;aid Fleming, it being proven that he either killed or wounded the defunct Robert Farquhar&s;on, or a&s;&s;aulted him with arms, or behaved him&s;elf as an ag|gre&s;&s;or, notwith&s;tanding the me&s;&s;enger's execution bearing him to be a witne&s;s to the caption.&endq;</NOTE>; and required a proof that he

<P>VIII. IT is now time to pa&s;s on to the other mode of ac|ce&s;&s;ion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Acce&s;&s;ion before the Fact.</NOTE>
which con&s;i&s;ts in things done previous to or in pur&s;u|ance
of the &s;laughter, without any (even con&s;tructive) pre&s;ence
at the deed it&s;elf. 1. In regard to acce&s;&s;ion before the fact.
It is in the general obvious, that who&s;oever, being in the
knowledge of the mortal purpo&s;e, though contrived and ima|gined
<PB N="427" REF="486">
by another, &s;hall lend immediate and material aid to|wards
the execution of it, is thus involved in the &s;ub&s;tantial
guilt of murder. He becomes partaker of the di&s;tingui&s;h|ing
character of the crime, the deliberate cruelty and ma|lice,
or depravity of heart. He encourages the others to
the deed by his countenance and fellow&s;hip; and as far as
he facilitates or forwards the enterpri&s;e, he mu&s;t be held
to be the cau&s;e why the thing is done; &s;ince the with|holding
of the&s;e aids might have altered the time, place, and
manner, and chance of &s;ucce&s;s of the attempt, or perhaps
might have hindered it from being made. The apothecary,
for in&s;tance, who prepares and furni&s;hes the deadly drug, to
be applied by another to the per&s;on of his neighbour, truly
takes the mo&s;t material &s;tep in the whole proce&s;s, and re|moves
the main ob&s;tacle to the perpetration of the murder;
and though not per&s;onally pre&s;ent at the admini&s;tration of
his do&s;e, has however his heart in the bu&s;ine&s;s as much
as his a&s;&s;ociate, and is equally de&s;erving of the highe&s;t
pains. The &s;ame is true of him, who, by fal&s;e pretences,
entices the victim to a place where he may conveniently be
&s;et upon, and gives notice to others, to way-lay him; or
who lends the u&s;e of his hou&s;e, as a convenient &s;tation
from which to fire on his neighbour, though he purpo&s;ely
leave home on the day when the deed is to be done; or
who harbours the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins there till the convenient &s;ea&s;on,
and accommodates them with arms &s;uited to their de&s;ign<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">&startq;Opem &s;erunt, qui cum crimini patrato non interfuerint, ferramenta tamen, tela, venena commodaverit, &s;ciens enjus rei cau&s;a commodaret.&endq; Mathaeus, Proleg. Chap. i. No. 11.</NOTE>,

the jury found Thom&s;on guilty of furni&s;hing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 16. &amp; 17. 1692.</NOTE> and Hay of
admini&s;tering the poi&s;on; on which verdict both had &s;en|tence
to be hanged, and to have their heads cut off, and
affixed on the goal of Lanark. Reference may al&s;o be made
to the ca&s;e of Muir of Auchindrayne;<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 17. 1611.</NOTE> who, having recei|ved
a letter from the Tutor of Ca&s;&s;illis, acquainting him of
his intention to travel next day to Edinburgh, and reque&s;t|ing
Muir to meet him at a certain place on the way, gave no|tice
of the&s;e things to Kennedy of Drummurchy, that he might
way-lay and kill him; which Kennedy accordingly did. For
this ba&s;e deed, and for afterwards murdering William Dal|rymple,
a boy who had been employed as a me&s;&s;enger on the
occa&s;ion, Muir had &s;entence of death. In like manner, Pa|trick
Kininmount had a relevancy found again&s;t him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 11. and Nov. 22. 1697.</NOTE> on the

This too was &s;u&s;tained, independently of the charge, al&s;o
made in the indictment, of the pannel having in&s;tigated the

<P>FOR what rea&s;on it was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Acce&s;&s;ion before the fact. July 29. and Aug. 5. 1695.</NOTE> I know not, that the like rele|vancy
was not found in the ca&s;e of James Edmon&s;ton. The
occa&s;ion of this trial was, that the Ma&s;ter of Rollo had been
killed by Graham of Inchbrakie, in their way from a hou&s;e
where they had dined together, in company with Edmon&s;ton,
M'Naughton, the Laird of Clavage, and others. Edmon&s;ton
was Inchbrakie's friend and comrade; and, <HI>as the libel told the
&s;tory,</HI> (but it was not fully &s;upported by the proof), Inchbra|kie
having in&s;ulted Rollo at table, Edmon&s;ton abetted him in
his rudene&s;s. The two whi&s;pered to each other at table,
and Edmon&s;ton was heard to &s;ay to the other, &startq;<HI>I would
not baulk him, Inchie.</HI>&endq; They then left the room, were
ab&s;ent for a while, and returned. In the evening, after
&s;upper, the whole party left the hou&s;e together, and took
the &s;ame road on hor&s;eback. At a certain &s;pot, however,
Edmon&s;ton and Inchbrakie parted for a &s;hort &s;pace from
the others; and Edmon&s;ton having unloo&s;ed his &s;word-belt,
gave his &s;word to Inchbrakie, who had none upon him.
Rollo and Inchbrakie then fell behind the party, by them|&s;elves;
and in a &s;hort time the others, riding on at &s;ome
di&s;tance, heard the cla&s;hing of &s;words. On turning back, they
find Rollo wounded and dying. Clavage exclaims, &startq;<HI>O what

but that it was fairly done.</HI>&endq; He then exchanges his hat with
Inchbrakie, who flies; and next morning, Edmon&s;ton's
&s;word and that of the decea&s;ed are found upon the &s;pot. All
the&s;e qualifications were found only relevant to infer an
arbitrary pain. A &s;pecial verdict was returned, convicting
him of certain only of the circum&s;tances libelled, (as indeed
there &s;eems to have been no proof of more); and he was ba|ni&s;hed
Scotland for life.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING this judgment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Acce&s;&s;ion before the Fact.</NOTE> which is &s;ingle of
its kind, it &s;eems to be true of all ca&s;es, where the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance
con&s;i&s;ts in furni&s;hing the immediate means of do|ing
the deed, tho&s;e means without which it either would
not be done at all, or at lea&s;t would be done after quite
a different manner, that they are proper ca&s;es of art
and part. I &s;ay the immediate means of doing the deed.
For if the a&s;&s;i&s;tance be only indirect and remote, this,
though accompanied with the knowledge in general of the
actor's malice and evil de&s;ign, cannot &s;afely be made the
ground of conviction. Put the ca&s;e, that John reveals to
James his purpo&s;e of revenge again&s;t a certain per&s;on, their
common enemy, who re&s;ides at a di&s;tance; and that James
lends him a hor&s;e for the journey, or gives him money at his
reque&s;t, to carry him to that quarter of the country. Some
weeks after, James is informed that the per&s;on in que&s;tion
has fallen; but as to the circum&s;tances of his death, and the
particular contrivance of his de&s;truction, the&s;e he only learns
from common fame, after the thing is done. Though highly
blameable in the part he has taken, he is not, however, pu|ni&s;hable
capitally, as art and part of the murder. The rea&s;on
is, that what he has done, is no part, properly &s;peaking, of
<PB N="431" REF="490">
the contrivance or &s;tory of the &s;laughter, which alone is the
matter of the charge and trial. It is true, he has a&s;&s;i&s;ted the
<HI>man,</HI> and helped him into a po&s;&s;ibility of attempting this ho|micide.
But he is not, and cannot be acce&s;&s;ary to the par|ticular
deed of &s;laughter, whereof the notion as to its time,
place, and manner, and all the circum&s;tances of its de&s;crip|tion,
was not &s;o much as formed, at the &s;ea&s;on when he gave
his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. For aught that he knew, the felonious pur|po&s;e
had been laid a&s;ide, or never had been &s;eriou&s;ly enter|tained.
And though his aid has been of &s;ervice to the actor
at one period, in bringing him into the &s;ituation where the
thing might be contrived and done; yet it in nowi&s;e entered
into the immediate act of contrivance or execution, &s;o as
to prompt, relieve, or a&s;&s;i&s;t the per&s;ons engaged. It is al&s;o
to be con&s;idered, on the part of the remote a&s;&s;i&s;tant, that he
has not pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;ame trial of his malice and de|termination,
as the principal actor and his immediate coad|jutors;
never having felt the terrors, agitations, and alarms,
that await on the la&s;t hours of con&s;ultation in &s;uch enter|pri&s;es,
when there is ju&s;t time, and no more, to repent and to
de&s;i&s;t<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><L>&startq;Between the thinking of a guilty thing,</L>
<L>And the fir&s;t moments of the execution,</L>
<L>All is combu&s;tion; and the &s;tate of man</L>

to his imagination, by knowledge of the detail with which
it is to be done; nor had the &s;ame opportunity as they, of
being &s;haken with fear for him&s;elf, or with pity for the de&s;|tined
victim. They have per&s;i&s;ted, not with&s;tanding the&s;e vi|&s;itations
of nature; but he has been put to no &s;uch te&s;t of his
heart and temper, and ought not therefore to be judged as that
&s;ame hardened and unpardonable offender, of whom no hope
<PB N="432" REF="491">
can be entertained. Be&s;ides; with re&s;pect to all aid of this re|mote
de&s;cription, aid that is referable to the man, rather
than to the &s;pecial act; its connection with the i&s;&s;ue, and
the &s;hare which it contributes to the pro&s;ecution and &s;ucce&s;s
of the attempt, is too conjectural and uncertain a matter, to
be a &s;afe ground of judgment in the&s;e que&s;tions of life and
death. Whereas, in that which palpably is &s;ub&s;ervient to
the particular plan, the a&s;&s;ociate knows how far his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
is material, and te&s;tifies, by affording it, his final re&s;o|lution,
and his de&s;ire of the event.</P>
<P>AND here I am led to ob&s;erve,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Acce&s;&s;ion before the Fact.</NOTE> that to be &s;u&s;tained as a
ground of art and part, the a&s;&s;i&s;tance mu&s;t not only be im|mediate,
but it mu&s;t be material too; &s;uch as &s;ub&s;tantially
forwards, and encourages to per&s;evere in the enterpri&s;e. For
if it only relate to &s;ome in&s;ignificant particular, in which the
actor might ea&s;ily be accommodated otherwi&s;e, or which, if
refu&s;ed, would neither hinder the deed, nor materially alter
the manner of it; then cannot the rendering of this &s;ervice be
con&s;trued as a participation of the contrivance or execution
of the &s;laughter, nor as a proof of any thing but a degree
of favour to the enterpri&s;e that is afoot. To de&s;cend to
particulars: If the pannel lent the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in his watch, that
he might know the hour, (having to lie in wait for the de|cea&s;ed),
or told him the neare&s;t road to the lurking place,
or gave him victuals to &s;u&s;tain him on his way thither; no

who on report brought to him by his inferior offi|cer,
gives him orders to fire on the populace mole&s;ting
his party, is equally an&s;werable for the con&s;equence, (if
the firing cannot be ju&s;tified on the &s;tate of the ca&s;e), as
if he per&s;onally commanded the party. That he has been
deceived with re&s;pect to the nature of the &s;ituation, is no ex|cu&s;e;
for he ought to go to the &s;pot and be convinced of
the nece&s;&s;ity by his own ob&s;ervation, before he give any ab|&s;olute
order in a matter of this importance. The &s;ame will
hold with re&s;pect to the magi&s;trate, conveying ra&s;h orders
to the officer, on the like occa&s;ion. It is upon the like
ground, that the Judge is equally an&s;werable as the inferior
mini&s;ters of the law, to whom his warrant is addre&s;&s;ed, in
ca&s;e of the execution of his illegal &s;entence of death.</P>
<P>IN ca&s;es like the&s;e, the relative &s;ituation of the parties is
a good rea&s;on, why the act of &s;laughter ought to be at the
hazard of the per&s;on who gives the order. But lawyers
have &s;aid, that the &s;ame will even hold in other ca&s;es of
command, &s;o it be urgent and authoritative, and i&s;&s;ued to
&s;uch per&s;ons who on the whole may rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed
to be under its influence, though they be not truly bound to
the &s;ame di&s;cipline, and implicit obedience, as in the &s;itu|ations
above mentioned. Between parent and child, for in|&s;tance,
or hu&s;band and wife, and perhaps, in &s;ome quarters
of the country, ma&s;ter and &s;ervant, or chieftain and clan&s;|man,
ca&s;es may be imagined, (though they would need to
be &s;trongly circum&s;tanced, and in truth none &s;uch have
ever been the &s;ubject of trial), in which the order given, and
immediately obeyed, may of it&s;elf be a ground of con|viction.
But it will very &s;eldom happen, that &s;uch an order
<PB N="434" REF="493">
is not accompanied with circum&s;tances of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, or other
concern in the deed, le&s;s or more, to &s;trengthen the charge;
which too is not &s;o favourable a &s;ort of charge in the pre&s;ent
&s;tate of the manners and habits of the country, as it may have
been in former times. In the &s;hort memorandum relative
to the ca&s;e of Alexander Home and Margaret Home,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 14. 1558.</NOTE> (but
of what crime accu&s;ed is not &s;aid), the Ju&s;tice finds, &startq;That
the words of the cau&s;ing command a&s;&s;i&s;tance and ratiha|bition,
is of the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance as art and part<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">This is extracted from the MS. Abridgment in the Advocate's Library, vol. 1. p. 45.</NOTE>.&endq; In
the ca&s;e too of Mackinto&s;h, in June 1673, the Court de|clared,
&startq;That command and hounding out in general falls
under the compa&s;s of art and part in &s;uch ca&s;es.&endq; At
the &s;ame time they found &startq;that the particular qualifica|tions
of command and hounding out mentioned by the
pur&s;uers in the di&s;pute, are not relevant to extend to man|date,
or hounding out, to found a criminal pur&s;uit.&endq; As
mentioned by Mackenzie<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">See Mackenzie, tit. Art and Part, No. 4.</NOTE>, the rea&s;on of this judgment was,
that the words of command to kill, though &s;trong, were
however in this re&s;pect ambiguous, that they might only re|late
to the ca&s;e of the deforcement of the me&s;&s;enger, along
with whom the pannel &s;ent his &s;ons to execute the caption.</P>
<P>3. ANOTHER ca&s;e of order or mandate which is certainly
relevant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Art and Part by hiring to kill.</NOTE> (and this though there be no bond nor relation be|tween
the parties), is that of order accompanied with the gi|ving
of a bribe, or hire, to do the deed. For the actor is here
to be con&s;idered only as an in&s;trument in the hand of the
employer.</P>
<P><PB N="435" REF="494">
4. THE article in this department which &s;eems chiefly to
be liable to controver&s;y,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Art and Part by Coun&s;el to kill.</NOTE> is that of acce&s;&s;ion by coun&s;el
or in&s;tigation; which, according to &s;ome authorities, is
of it&s;elf &s;ufficient to &s;ubject the advi&s;er to the pains of
murder. Certain things may be ob&s;erved, on the one and
the other &s;ide, which will at lea&s;t &s;erve to circum&s;cribe
the debate. It mu&s;t be yielded, with re&s;pect to that &s;ort
of coun&s;el which is not purely &s;uch, but truly amounts
to a &s;hare in the contrivance of the deed, that this is
ground of conviction as art and part. He, for in&s;tance,
who not only exhorts and urges in general to do the
&s;laughter, but proceeds to &s;how how ea&s;ily and how &s;afely
it may be done in a certain way, or at a certain time and
place, and opens the detail of a contrivance for execution
of the purpo&s;e, which plan is accordingly followed, may
ju&s;tly be accounted one of the mo&s;t important per&s;ons in the
&s;tory, though he leave the entire execution to his a&s;&s;ociates.
An addre&s;s of this kind is not a naked advice, which has
no effect on the per&s;on to whom it is given, farther than as a
coincidence of wi&s;hes, but is in truth a mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance,
which may be of as much &s;ervice towards the perpe|tration
of the deed, and may as much determine the actor to
the attempt, as even the promi&s;e of pre&s;ence at the fact.
The advi&s;er here equips the actor for the bu&s;ine&s;s; <HI>in&s;truit con|cilio;</HI>
and is the life and &s;ource of the enterpri&s;e. The ca&s;e,
already mentioned, of Muir of Auchindrayne, was in &s;ome
mea&s;ure of this de&s;cription; becau&s;e the pannel had not only
in&s;tigated the actor, but had adverti&s;ed him of the convenient
time and place, when the deed might with certainty be done.
Perhaps it is with reference to this &s;ort of coun&s;el, <HI>concilium
cum ope,</HI> that &s;ome of tho&s;e authorities are to be under&s;tood,
which &s;peak of in&s;tigation, (or <HI>hounding out</HI> as it is termed
with us), as amounting to art and part.</P>
<P><PB N="436" REF="495">
IT is no le&s;s plain on the other part, with re&s;pect to any
advice which does not favour of a&s;&s;i&s;tance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Art and Part by Coun&s;el to kill.</NOTE> that is mu&s;t at
lea&s;t be very &s;erious, urgent, and pointed, to bring it under
the compa&s;s of art and part. No proclaiming of it as a
meritorious thing to de&s;troy the decea&s;ed; no words of mere
permi&s;&s;ion or allowance to do the deed; no intimation of
thanks or approbation if it &s;hall be done; not the &s;tronge&s;t
expre&s;&s;ions of hatred to the decea&s;ed, nor the mo&s;t earne&s;t
wi&s;hes for his death: none of the&s;e things come up to
what the law in this matter requires. Becau&s;e, though
wrong and blameable, they are, however, all of them, no|thing
more than the expre&s;&s;ion of the party's own di&s;tempered
&s;tate of mind; which may indeed tend to infect others with
the &s;ame evil di&s;po&s;ition, and to make them &s;u&s;ceptible
of mi&s;chief; but &s;till has no relation to any &s;pecial at|tempt
or immediate cour&s;e of action, nor is even a certain
proof of that &s;ettled habit of mind in the &s;peaker, which
would make him join in any &s;uch enterpri&s;e, if it were ac|tually
afoot. This rule is exemplified in the ca&s;e of Bar|bara
Coutts;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maclaurin, No. 97.</NOTE> where, though a capital relevancy was found
on the general charge of art and part, yet her particular ex|pre&s;&s;ions
of rage and hatred again&s;t the decea&s;ed, though
very bitter and malignant, were found to be only puni&s;hable
in &s;ome inferior way. In &s;hort, the only coun&s;el which can
plau&s;ibly be maintained to come under the intendment of the
law in this matter, is a direct and &s;pecial coun&s;el; a per&s;ua|&s;ion
to kill by u&s;e of the topics calculated to work on the
particular man, and relative, le&s;s or more, to &s;ome near oc|ca&s;ion
of doing the deed; whereby to excite him to an im|mediate
cour&s;e of mea&s;ures towards the &s;laughter.</P>
<P><PB N="437" REF="496">
EVEN with re&s;pect to this &s;ort of coun&s;el, if in any ca&s;e
it is to be &s;u&s;tained to involve in the pains of the principal
offence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Art and Part by Coun&s;el to kill.</NOTE> it is at lea&s;t under provi&s;ion, that the coun&s;el
have been the &s;layer's main incitement and &s;pring of action;
that circum&s;tance in the ca&s;e, without which the deed would
not have been done. For if John, bearing malice to
James, lay a plan to kill him, and communicate this to
George, who encourages and confirms him in his purpo&s;e,
but without lending any &s;ort of aid, George cannot be pu|ni&s;hed
as author of the murder. It is thus a material con&s;i|deration
in all &s;uch ca&s;es, In who&s;e quarel was the deed
done? in that of the advi&s;er or the actor? If in the ac|tor's
quarrel, certainly the ju&s;t pre&s;umption will be, (for
to this we mu&s;t have recour&s;e in the impo&s;&s;ibility of tracing
the truth), that in a matter &s;o intere&s;ting to him he was
mainly determined by his own pa&s;&s;ions and impre&s;&s;ions, and
would have acted as he did, if he had been left to him&s;elf.
The bare advice, without proffer of comfort or a&s;&s;i&s;tance,
cannot rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed to controul the will of a free
and independent per&s;on on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, where all the
labour and all the ri&s;k of the enterpri&s;e is to be his own. If,
on the contrary, it can be &s;hown that the quarrel was
the advi&s;er's bu&s;ine&s;s, or the common concern of both,
this is a circum&s;tance on the other &s;ide. And if it be
&s;trengthened with other con&s;iderations, &s;uch as the depend|ence
of the actor on the advi&s;er, or the known a&s;cendency
which the advi&s;er has over him; po&s;&s;ibly &s;uch a ca&s;e may
be made out, (though none &s;uch has yet been tried), as
&s;hall fix the guilt on the advi&s;er, as author and imaginer
of the deed. Put the ca&s;e, for in&s;tance, (though per|haps
not the mo&s;t likely to happen), of a young wo|man,
in&s;tigated by the father of a natural child with
<PB N="438" REF="497">
which &s;he is pregnant, to de&s;troy it on the birth. Let us
&s;uppo&s;e, that his letters to her are recovered, in which he
opens the purpo&s;e to her; in&s;i&s;ts on the evil con&s;equences
of a di&s;covery of her &s;ituation; per&s;uades her how ea&s;y to
be done, and to be concealed; and by artful arguments pal|liates
the wickedne&s;s of the propo&s;al. In return to the&s;e,
&s;uppo&s;e her letters al&s;o to be recovered, at fir&s;t rejecting the
purpo&s;e with horror, and in the &s;equel bearing the hi&s;tory
of her gradual and reluctant compliance on his account, and
won over by his influence and importunity. If &s;uch a ca&s;e
could happen, without &s;ome farther circum&s;tance of aid
or contrivance on the part of the man; perhaps it might
be held to po&s;&s;e&s;s all tho&s;e qualities which are naturally
requi&s;ite in an advice, to bring it under the de&s;cription of
art and part. But it is obvious, that a ca&s;e of pure and
&s;imple advice, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all tho&s;e qualities, and in which
the hi&s;tory of the guilt is at the &s;ame time capable of being
&s;ub&s;tantiated by proof, is rather &s;uppo&s;ed for the &s;ake of il|lu&s;tration,
than likely to be the &s;ubject of trial.</P>
<P>WE may now di&s;mi&s;s the&s;e ca&s;es of hire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;e of Man|date, &amp;c. to kill, retracted.</NOTE> command, and
coun&s;el, after making this ob&s;ervation, which is appli|cable
alike to all of them; that the mandant, advi&s;er,
or &s;o forth, can only be liable as art and part, if in truth
the &s;laughter is done under the influence of his commi&s;&s;ion
or advice. If he repents him of his purpo&s;e, and comes
to the actor to retract his command, and &s;eriou&s;ly does all
that in him lies to di&s;&s;uade from and hinder the deed;
though the actor &s;hould per&s;i&s;t, whether becau&s;e his heart
is now full of enmity, through his long meditation on the
&s;ubject, or that he <HI>will</HI> do it to be revenged of the mandant,
and make him guilty by pro&s;ecution of his order in &s;pite
<PB N="439" REF="498">
of him, he is at lea&s;t free of the guilt of murder: though
he never can entirely wipe out the &s;tain he has contracted,
by proceeding to &s;o hazardous a length again&s;t his neigh|bour.
Again; if the ca&s;e be that the mandant has only
meant to retract his commi&s;&s;ion, but in truth has not done
it, though only owing to an accident, &s;uch as the lo&s;s of a
letter or the like; he has then no advantage by his altered
purpo&s;e: For it is &s;till true, that on his mandate this
murder has been committed. He is the cau&s;e why any
&s;uch accident is of moment in the ca&s;e; and at his hazard
it mu&s;t therefore be, if, by any means, his order is not coun|termanded,
but runs on, and comes to an i&s;&s;ue. He has laid
and kindled the train, and he mu&s;t break it off at his peril.</P>
<P>BY the &s;ame rule,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;e of Mandate to injure follow|ed with Death.</NOTE> it will not even acquit the mandant,
that the &s;laughter has been committed without his expre&s;s
order, if it be the natural and probable con&s;equence of that
which he commanded to be done: As if he order John to
waylay and violently beat James, and John beat him &s;o
that he dies; or if he order John to rob James, and on his
re&s;i&s;ting, John kill him on the &s;pot. In all &s;uch ca&s;es, ha|ving
authori&s;ed a great and dangerous wrong, he mu&s;t an|&s;wer
the ordinary concomitant hazards, which he might
and ought to have con&s;idered, ju&s;t as in any crime commit|ted
by him&s;elf in per&s;on. There is the &s;ame rea&s;on, why no
variation from the command &s;hould free the giver, if it is
only a variation in the circum&s;tance and manner, and not in
the &s;ub&s;tance of the act; as if the per&s;on be knocked on the
head in&s;tead of being &s;hot according to the order, or if on
command to kill him on &s;uch a day at &s;uch a place, and
this opportunity being lo&s;t, he is killed &s;ome days after, and
at the next convenient &s;tation.</P>
<P><PB N="440" REF="499">
BUT what &s;hall be &s;aid, if there is a variation in the per|&s;on
killed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;e of Vari|ation from the Order to kill.</NOTE> by di&s;patching one per&s;on in&s;tead of another,
again&s;t whom alone the mandate was? Fo&s;ter &s;eems well to
have re&s;olved this que&s;tion by a di&s;tinction. If John have
hired James to poi&s;on &s;uch a one, whom James well knows,
and James, choo&s;ing rather to execute his own enmity,
give the poi&s;on to another; there can be no good rea&s;on why
John &s;hould an&s;wer for this event with his life. The link is
wanting here between the act and the order. James, at
applying the poi&s;on, is in nowi&s;e under the influence of
John's order, but only u&s;es it as the occa&s;ion of executing a|nother
and quite a di&s;tinct crime, which in the wickedne&s;s of
his own heart he has conceived, and wilfully grafted on it.
But if John hire James, to lie in wait for George at a cer|tain
place by night, and William, happening to pa&s;s at the
appointed hour, is killed by James, who mi&s;takes him for
George; this is quite another ca&s;e, and &s;uch as affords John
no manner of plea for relief. The mortal blow has been
given under the influence of his warrant and in&s;tigation;
and the accidental variation which has happened, is ju&s;t one
of tho&s;e natural and probable hazards of the ca&s;e, which the
contriver of the &s;ituation mu&s;t run: Indeed the mi&s;take might
equally have fallen out in his own hands, if he had been ac|tor
as well as contriver. The &s;nare he wickedly laid for
one, another, through his guilt, has fallen into, and peri&s;h|ed.
The malice, therefore, adheres to him, and connects
with the actual, equally as it would have done with the in|tended,
even. Doubtle&s;s, the actor al&s;o is an&s;werable for the
deed of his own hand, which is equally wicked, whether
he kill the per&s;on intended, or another. In the&s;e ob&s;erva|tions,
I have followed the doctrine of the Engli&s;h authori|ties<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hale, vol. i. p. 617.; Hawkins, b. 2. ch. 29. No. 18. <HI>et &s;eq.;</HI> Fo&s;ter. p. 370. 371.; Black&s;tone, vol. iv. p. 37.</NOTE>
<PB N="441" REF="500">
and chiefly of Hale and Fo&s;ter; which is grounded in
natural and univer&s;al principles, and &s;eems both to be more
rea&s;onable, and more preci&s;e, than that which Mackenzie,
$n the authority only of the foreign doctors, and not of any
thing which has been &s;ettled by our own cu&s;tom, has deli|vered.</P>
<P>I SHALL not enter farther into a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the many
po&s;&s;ible que&s;tions concerning acce&s;&s;ories before the fact;
but &s;hall ob&s;erve as a conclu&s;ion to the whole, that there
can be none &s;uch in culpable homicide on provocation,
nor in homicide in &s;elf-defence <HI>cum exce&s;&s;u moderaminis;</HI>
becau&s;e it is in the nature of all &s;uch &s;laughter to be
done on a &s;udden, and in &s;uch a manner as excludes all pre|vious
coun&s;el or concert. It is po&s;&s;ible, on the other hand,
to imagine ca&s;es, where the mandant, in&s;tigator, or con|triver,
&s;hall be an&s;werable, and the immediate actor be
entirely free. As if an idiot or a madman be &s;et on to
murder; or if one give a per&s;on poi&s;on through the hands of
his &s;ervant, which the &s;ervant admini&s;ters, believing it to
be a &s;afe medicine. The &s;ervant is innocent, but the furni&s;h|er
of the poi&s;on is guilty of murder.<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 15. 1705.</NOTE> This actually happen|ed
in the ca&s;e of Robert Bi&s;&s;et, who admini&s;tered poi&s;on
to his wife by the hands of their &s;ervant Helen Jamie&s;on,
to whom he delivered it as a medicine, which had come for
his wife from the apothecary. This &s;ervant was the chief
witne&s;s again&s;t him on his trial. But he was not convicted
to the full extent of the charge; and therefore e&s;caped with
his life.</P>
<P><PB N="442" REF="501">
IX. THE only other &s;ort of acce&s;&s;ion is by things done
after,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Acce&s;&s;ion after the Fact.</NOTE> and in pur&s;uance of the act of &s;laughter; &s;uch as con|cealing
the dead body, approving the deed, harbouring the
actors, or enabling them to e&s;cape. It is clear, that, taken
along with previous knowledge of the purpo&s;e of &s;laughter,
or in&s;tigation to commit it, or any aid lent in the contrivance
or execution of it, this of after a&s;&s;i&s;tance will be a &s;trong
ingredient to make out the charge of art and part; as it
&s;trengthens a train of facts, which on the whole go to prove
a &s;hare taken in the enterpri&s;e, and indeed to pre&s;ume a pro|mi&s;e
of that a&s;&s;i&s;tance which is afterwards given, and where|of
the expectation would &s;ub&s;tantially encourage to the at|tempt.
And here I may cite the ca&s;e of Robert Walker,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 15. 1642.</NOTE> and
David and Margaret Graham, tried for the murder of I&s;obel
Walker, the wife of Robert. The &s;ole actor here was David
Graham, who &s;trangled the woman in a &s;olitary place in the
night; being in&s;tigated thereto by the other two, who con|trived
the occa&s;ion of the deed, by &s;ending her on a pretend|ed
errand in the night. Robert expre&s;&s;ed his joy on hearing
that the deed was done. And having taken her plaid, and
wrapped it round the corp&s;e, he, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the o|ther
pannels, carried it to the river, and ca&s;t it into a &s;almon
cruive. On the&s;e grounds, they were all found art and part of
the murder, and were condemned to die. Of this de&s;cription
al&s;o was the noted ca&s;e of James Stewart in Aucharn,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 21. 22. 23. 25. 1752.</NOTE> for the
murder of Campbell of Glenure; where the a&s;&s;i&s;tance given the
murderer to e&s;cape after the deed, was joined to &s;undry circum|&s;tances
of previous aid and comfort towards the commi&s;&s;ion
of it. It is true, that this trial was attended with &s;everal very
unu&s;ual things in the manner of conducting it, and for which
it would be very difficult to find any apology; but I &s;ee no
rea&s;on to believe that the verdict was not according to the
<PB N="443" REF="502">
ju&s;tice of the ca&s;e, or different from what the jury were
warranted to return upon the evidence laid before them.</P>
<P>BUT, how &s;ufficient &s;oever the grounds of conviction in
the&s;e and the like ca&s;es; it is a very different &s;ort of charge,
and &s;eems to con&s;titute a di&s;tinct offence from homicide,
where the after a&s;&s;i&s;tance is libelled by it&s;elf, unconnected
with any earlier knowledge of, or concern in the deed.
To a&s;&s;i&s;t in concealing the dead body; to harbour the actors,
and help them to e&s;cape; to re&s;cue them from the officers
of ju&s;tice; to bear fal&s;e witne&s;s for them on their trial;
or to per&s;uade others to do &s;o, or to &s;uppre&s;s their te&s;ti|mony
again&s;t them; all the&s;e are, doubtle&s;s, immoral and
criminal acts, and from which &s;u&s;picion may &s;ometimes
ari&s;e again&s;t the per&s;ons convicted of them, of a deeper
concern in the deed. But they are no part of the hi|&s;tory
of the &s;laughter; nay they do not even nece&s;&s;arily
infer an approbation of it; &s;ince they may be done out
of affection only or compa&s;&s;ion for the actors, to relieve
them of the con&s;equences of that which cannot be reme|died
nor undone.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maclaurin, No. 97.</NOTE> In the ca&s;e, accordingly, of Barbara

re&s;etting his &s;on, who had committed murder, and deterring
a con&s;table who pur&s;ued him red-hand, the pannel's plea
<PB N="444" REF="503">
&s;eems to have had the effect of hindering the libel to be pro|&s;ecuted
to any i&s;&s;ue. It is true, that in his ob&s;ervations on the
&s;tatute 1426, c. 91. that author &s;eems him&s;elf to have given
a different opinion of our law. But in this he has not duly
attended to the &s;tatute which he cites as his authority; for
it has relation only to the harbouring of denounced cri|minals.
Be&s;ides, even in the times (if ever there were &s;uch),
when this enactment was ob&s;erved; &s;till the re&s;etting of the
man&s;layer was not puni&s;hed as an acce&s;&s;ion to the murder,
but as a &s;pecial and di&s;tinct offence <HI>of re&s;etting,</HI> created by
&s;tatute for the better execution of ju&s;tice, which was then
&s;o difficult to be enforced.</P>
<P>WHAT is true of the&s;e modes of after a&s;&s;i&s;tance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Acce&s;&s;ion by ratifying the Deed.</NOTE> &s;eems
to be equally &s;o of that &s;till more remote concern, which
only con&s;i&s;ts in ratifying and approving the murder;
whether by &s;peaking in prai&s;e of the deed, or more &s;ub|&s;tantially,
by reward be&s;towed on the actor, or by com|fort
and countenance rendered him on account of it. To
applaud, and much more to recompen&s;e &s;o foul a crime, is
indeed a thing of too pernicious example to pa&s;s uncen&s;ured
by the law; not to mention, that &s;u&s;picion may naturally be
entertained of tho&s;e who thus prai&s;e and confirm the deed,
that they &s;ecretly abetted it beforehand. Yet &s;till, by it&s;elf,
and un&s;upported with proof of in&s;tigation or a&s;&s;i&s;tance, it is
only a mi&s;demeanour, and not a participation of the act of
&s;laughter; not even, which is the mo&s;t unfavourable ca&s;e for
the pannel, though it &s;hould appear that in his name, or on
his quarrel, the deed was done. For one man cannot impli|cate
another in guilt, by acting on his own opinion of his wi&s;hes
and de&s;ires, if the&s;e have never been communicated to him the
actor in a palpable form, &s;o as to be motives of his deed. And
<PB N="445" REF="504">
it is not a certain inference, that he who expre&s;&s;es &s;atisfaction
at the doing of &s;uch a thing without his ri&s;k or participation,
would have authori&s;ed or have taken a part in the enterpri&s;e,
if propo&s;ed to him. Be&s;ides; if the inference were even cer|tain,
the fact has not happened &s;o; and it is not for their evil
di&s;po&s;itions that men are puni&s;hed, but for the evil things
which they have actually done. There are indeed certain
texts of the Roman law, which have often been quoted on
the other &s;ide<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Dig. de vi Armata, L. 1. No. 14; L. 3. No. 10.</NOTE>; but I find nothing in the books of adjour|nal
to countenance the opinion, that our practice would
be determined by tho&s;e authorities. It mu&s;t, however, al|ways
be remembered, that if the pannel not only ratify the
deed when done, but have known and countenanced, or have
in&s;tigated to it, beforehand, this may amount to an acce&s;|&s;ion;

form of proce&s;s again&s;t an acce&s;&s;ary to this crime. In this
article, the courts of England &s;eem to be embarra&s;&s;ed with
a number of &s;ubtile, and (as they appear to us) un&s;ub&s;tantial
di&s;tinctions, to which our practice is a &s;tranger. With us,
the principal actor and the acce&s;&s;ary, in whatever way he
is &s;o, may be called in one libel, and put to the bar toge|ther<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">This was found on full con&s;ideration, in a ca&s;e of indictment for ca&s;ting down of hou&s;es; the ca&s;e of Robert&s;ons in March 1671; where the principal actors were two boys, the &s;ons of the in&s;tigator and ratifier. The rule &s;eems to be equally applicable to a charge of murder David Hay and John Thom&s;on for admini&s;tering and furni&s;hing poi&s;on, were accordingly tried and convicted on one libel in the &s;ame diet. March 16. 17. 1692.</NOTE>. Or if the actor has &s;led, the acce&s;&s;ary may be tried
on that &s;ame libel, after &s;entence of fugitation pa&s;&s;ed on it
again&s;t the actor; for the pro&s;ecutor has nothing farther in
his power. This was done in the ca&s;e of Robert and Gil|bert
Kennedy, in July 1706; and of Stewart of Aucharn,
in September 1752. Nay, the trial may even proceed with|out
that &s;ort of &s;entence again&s;t the actor, which is only a
&s;entence for contempt, and does not take place on the notion
of the outlaw's guilt of the charge, or if it did, &s;till could be
no manner of pre&s;umption again&s;t his a&s;&s;ociate, who can
only be convicted on full proof of the <HI>corpus delicti,</HI> and
of his own concern in the &s;laughter, in like manner as if no
fugitation had pa&s;&s;ed. This point &s;eems to have been final|ly
&s;ettled in the ca&s;e of James Edmon&s;ton.<NOTE PLACE="marg">May 29. and July 29. 1695.</NOTE> Being brought to
trial, alone, on a libel which &s;tated the murder as the act of
another, and him as in&s;tigator only and a&s;&s;i&s;tant, he pleaded,
<PB N="447" REF="506">
that the trial could not proceed until the actors were con|victed,
or at lea&s;t di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by &s;entence of fugitation. This
dilatory objection was repelled, and the trial went on. The
&s;ame judgment had been given long ago, in the ca&s;e of Muir
of Auchindrayne, in July 1611, who objected that Kennedy,
the actor, had not been di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. Indeed, every objection
of this &s;ort is in a great mea&s;ure excluded by the very form
of our criminal libel, in which the pannel is always charg|ed
in both characters, of actor or art and part; whereby the
ca&s;e is laid open to a conviction of either &s;ort of guilt, as
the fact may turn out to be. It is al&s;o certain, that un|der
this form of charge, the pro&s;ecutor is admitted to a
proof of all circum&s;tances, prior, concomitant, or after the
fact, from which the acce&s;&s;ion may be inferred.</P>
<P>X. THE pains of law for murder,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Puni&s;hment of Murder.</NOTE> are the pains of
death, and confi&s;cation of moveables. In atrocious ca&s;es,
it had been u&s;ual for the Judge to award &s;ome farther
&s;uffering or indignity, the better to mark the public de|te&s;tation
of the crime; &s;uch as &s;triking off the hand be|fore
execution; the hanging of the dead body in chains;
the quartering of the body, and affixing of the head and
limbs on con&s;picuous places, to keep up the memory and
terror of the example. And by a late &s;tatute, the 25th
George II. ch. 37. entitled, <HI>for better preventing the horrid
crime of murder,</HI> it is ordered, that the &s;entence &s;hall be
for delivery of the body to &s;urgeons, to be di&s;&s;ected,
(unle&s;s ordered to be hung in chains); and that in no
ca&s;e &s;hall the body be buried, until it be di&s;&s;ected. It
farther appoints, that during the period between &s;entence
and execution, the convict &s;hall be confined apart from all
other pri&s;oners, and without acce&s;s of any per&s;on to him,
<PB N="448" REF="507">
unle&s;s by permi&s;&s;ion of the Sheriff, or of the Court where he
was convicted; as al&s;o, that he &s;hall be fed (excepting in
ca&s;e of violent illne&s;s), with bread and water only.</P>
<P>WHERE it happens,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A&s;&s;ythment in what Ca&s;es due.</NOTE> that the pannel is only convicted of
culpable homicide, or that &s;entence is prevented by an act
of indemnity, or that he e&s;capes execution of the capital
&s;entence through interpo&s;ition of the royal mercy; as al&s;o,
according to one,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maclaurin, No. 99.</NOTE> but a doubtful deci&s;ion, where he is out|lawed
for non-appearance; in all the&s;e &s;ituations, one other
con&s;equence is, that he becomes liable in a &s;um of money,
or <HI>a&s;&s;ythment,</HI> as it is called, to the widow and children, or
other the next of kin of the decea&s;ed. This exaction, whe|ther
it is properly to be viewed as <HI>damages</HI> decreed to tho&s;e
per&s;ons in &s;atisfaction of the injury which they &s;u&s;tain by
the lo&s;s of their relation, or, (which is the opinion of Lord
Kames<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Law Tracts, vol. ii. art. 1. at the end.</NOTE>, and in it&s;elf &s;eems not improbable), as the remains
of a more barbarous &s;tate of things, before the full e&s;tabli&s;h|ment
of public ju&s;tice, when the criminal redeemed his
blood, and pacified the re&s;entment of the kindred, by pay|ment
of a &s;tated compo&s;ition<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">See this matter argued, Maclaurin, No. 98.</NOTE>; has at all times been part of
our cu&s;tom. And this &s;o firmly, that even the Sovereign ne|ver
pretended to have any power of protecting the criminal
again&s;t it; &s;o far from it, that by the ordinary &s;tyle of all
remi&s;&s;ions, they bore a clau&s;e obliging to a&s;&s;yth the party<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">See Act 1424, c. 46.</NOTE>.
And indeed, &s;uch was the &s;trictne&s;s ob&s;erved of old in this

execute to the deid for the &s;aids crimes, notwith&s;tanding

have effect, nor be allowed in Court, unle&s;s it proceeded (and
bore <HI>in gremio</HI> &s;o to be), on evidence of &s;atisfaction already
made to the kindred, and on the &s;ight of &s;ufficient <HI>litterae
pacis,</HI> or <HI>letters of &s;lains,</HI> obtained from them. The&s;e were
letters, &s;igned by the four principal branches of the kindred
of the decea&s;ed<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">See Bal&s;our's Practicks, p. 517.</NOTE>, or the greater part of them, bearing re|ceipt
of the a&s;&s;ythment, granting oblivion of the injury, di&s;|charging
the offender of all action, civil or criminal, at their
in&s;tance, on that account, and reque&s;ting the King to grant
him a remi&s;&s;ion. But though this in &s;trictne&s;s was the law;
in practice it had long ago been thus far relaxed, that a re|mi&s;&s;ion
might pa&s;s in Exchequer without production of the
letters of &s;lains, on &s;urety found there to the &s;atisfaction
of the Court, for payment of &s;uch a &s;um as &s;hould afterwards
be awarded.</P>
<P><PB N="450" REF="509">
IN this cour&s;e of proceeding, the care of taxing and decree|ing
for the a&s;&s;ythment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What Court competent to tax A&s;&s;yth|ment.</NOTE> as an appendage of the pardon, natu|rally
fell to the Judges of Exchequer. But of late years, the
ordinary cour&s;e of expeding remi&s;&s;ions has been, that they go
from the Secretary of State's office to the &s;eals <HI>per &s;altum,</HI>
without pa&s;&s;ing through Exchequer at all. And in con|&s;equence,
the practice has been introduced of allowing a re|mi&s;&s;ion
in the Court of Ju&s;ticiary, on &s;urety found, (and
&s;ometimes on enactment of the party him&s;elf<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">This was allowed at pa&s;&s;ing the remi&s;&s;ion in the ca&s;e of Piccars and Collins, 22d April 1728; they being &s;trangers and &s;oldiers, and unable to find &s;urety.

a&s;&s;ythment as &s;hall afterwards be modified in the proper
Court. Commonly, the care of fixing the &s;um, and &s;eeing
the caution duly found, has been remitted by the criminal
Court to the Barons of Exchequer; owing probably to their
ancient connection with this &s;ort of bu&s;ine&s;s. This was
done in the ca&s;e of Macneil,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 21. 1717.</NOTE> (who appears to have lain in
goal until evidence was produced to the Court, of his pay|ment
of the &s;um taxed in Exchequer); in the ca&s;e of Ma|thews,
November 13. 1721; of Sir Gilbert Elliot of Stobs,
July 30. 1727; of Jo&s;eph Hume, December 22. 1732; and
of David Hume,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 3. 1740.</NOTE> March 27. 1733. But on occa&s;ion of
Sir James Stewart's remi&s;&s;ion, for the &s;laughter of Moody of
Mel&s;etter, the remit was to the Court of Se&s;&s;ion; where
proce&s;s was accordingly rai&s;ed by the &s;on of the decea&s;ed,
in June 1741. The &s;ame cour&s;e was taken at allowing the
remi&s;&s;ion in favour of Thomas Roy, June 24. 1760. And in|deed
it &s;eems probable, that on pleading of pardon in the Court
of Ju&s;ticiary, they are as competent to tax the a&s;&s;ythment
them&s;elves, as to delegate this office to any other judicature.

Ju&s;ticiary is at in&s;tance of the kindred of the decea&s;ed, and

there a regular and legitimate part of the &s;entence, to tax and

have juri&s;diction in proce&s;s brought for the a&s;&s;ythment by
the next of kin, as a matter of pure pecuniary intere&s;t,
which is the proper province of that Court. This &s;eems to
be a&s;&s;umed, (for I do not think it is introduced), in the enact|ment

of this Chapter, I have now to treat of the ca&s;es of AGGRA|VATED
MURDER; tho&s;e ca&s;es, where either on account of
&s;ome peculiar ba&s;ene&s;s or cruelty in the mode of the deed,

under tru&s;t, as a matter which cannot now be the &s;ub|ject
of any que&s;tion in a court of ju&s;tice. The thing was
e&s;tabli&s;hed by the &s;tatute 1587, ch. 51. which declares it to
be &startq;quhair the partie &s;laine is under the trai&s;t, credite, a&s;&s;u|rance
and power of the &s;layer,&endq; and rai&s;es the crime to
the rank of trea&s;on&punc;; ordering the offender to &startq;forfault life,
lands and goods.&endq; In them&s;elves, the words of this de|&s;cription

of pa&s;&s;ing the act; namely, the murder of the Laird
of Maclean in 1586, by one of the Macdonalds who had
been in feud with him, but enticed him to his hou&s;e with
&s;pecial invitations, and promi&s;es of &s;afety. The proper ca&s;es
<PB N="453" REF="512">
therefore, to which the &s;tatute applied, were tho&s;e where the
decea&s;ed had put him&s;elf into the killer's power, as at that
particular time, under the pledge and a&s;&s;urance, (either ex|pre&s;s,
or implied in the nature of the &s;ituation), of ho&s;pitality,
&s;afety, and protection; and in the&s;e it would more e&s;peci|ally
hold, if there had been previous feud between the par|ties,
to occa&s;ion the exacting of &s;uch a pledge. It was under|&s;tood
in this &s;en&s;e in the following ca&s;es, where &s;entence

4. ANOTHER &s;ort of murder, which, according to Mac|kenzie<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">B. 1. tit. 8.</NOTE>, had been made trea&s;on by the &s;tatutes 1450,
c. 31. and 32.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Murder by Poi&s;on.</NOTE> is murder committed by means of poi&s;on.
And certainly, in every point of view, it ju&s;tly holds the
rank of a dangerous and aggravated murder; whether it be
con&s;idered with re&s;pect to the deliberate and continued ma|lice
which is &s;hown in the contrivance of it; or the cruelty
of &s;uch a way of compa&s;&s;ing death, which (as Mackenzie
ob&s;erves) is &s;uch, that the law will not employ it even
again&s;t a criminal; or the impo&s;&s;ibility of guarding again&s;t
&s;uch attempts, which tho&s;e per&s;ons have the ea&s;ie&s;t and mo&s;t
frequent opportunities of making, who are in &s;ituations of
confidence and tru&s;t. Neverthele&s;s, it will be difficult to find
a warrant for applying the pains of trea&s;on to this crime,
in either of the above mentioned &s;tatutes; whereof both
the words and the rubric, (whatever might be the intention
of the Legi&s;lature), are &s;trictly limited to the homebringers
of poi&s;on, and have no relation to the u&s;ers. And thus we
are at no lo&s;s to account for that which Mackenzie him&s;elf,
both in his Treati&s;e of Crimes and his ob&s;ervations on the&s;e
&s;tatutes, has remarked, (though he wonders how it &s;hould be
&s;o); that he had found no in&s;tance in the records, of the
pains of trea&s;on inflicted on the giver of poi&s;on. Yet not a few
atrocious ca&s;es had happened, to which probably the Judges
applied the utmo&s;t &s;everity, that was held to be within
their power. I &s;hall mention one of the mo&s;t remarkable.
On the 1&s;t of December 1613, Robert Er&s;kine, and his
&s;i&s;ters, Helen, I&s;obel, and Anne Er&s;kine, were convicted of
con&s;piring to de&s;troy two youths, his nephews, &s;ons of the
<PB N="457" REF="516">
Laird of Dun, his brother, by &s;orcery and poi&s;on, in order
to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the family-e&s;tate. The libel relates, that
for this purpo&s;e they went and con&s;ulted with Janet Irving, a
notorious witch, how they might be&s;t de&s;troy the children;
and that &s;he furni&s;hed them with certain herbs, to compo&s;e a
<HI>draught;</HI> of which the elde&s;t boy having drank, was &s;eized with
violent vomiting, and died &startq;in great pain and dolour&endq;, utter|ing
the&s;e or the like words upon his deathbed, &startq;Wo is me that
I ever had right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ione to ony landis or living, for

been &s;a demanit, nor &s;ic wicket practicks had bene plottit
againis me for my landis.&endq; The other boy recovered.
The&s;e pannels were convicted, and had &s;entence to be be|headed;
which was executed on all but Helen, who was al|lowed
to go into bani&s;hment. There is no mention of for|feiture
in the &s;entence. Neither is it any part of the doom
on John Dick and Janet Alexander his &s;pou&s;e, who were
convicted in March 1649, of the murder of his brother and
&s;i&s;ter, having poi&s;oned them with ar&s;enick, which was admi|ni&s;tered
in a loaf or <HI>bannock.</HI></P>
<P>BUT it is needle&s;s to enter farther into this di&s;cu&s;&s;ion now,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Murder by Poi&s;on.</NOTE>
after the &s;tatute of Anne, which has lowered this &s;ort of mur|der
from the rank of trea&s;on, if ever it &s;tood in that degree.
The following are &s;ome of the mo&s;t noted trials for it in later
times.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 12. 1754.</NOTE> Nicolas Cockburn was convicted of the murder
of her hu&s;band and his mother; a crime to which the main
incentive &s;eems to have been, to di&s;appoint a beneficial &s;ettle|ment
in favour of the mother as a widow.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 9. &amp; 12. 1755.</NOTE> Andrew Wil&s;on was
convicted of poi&s;oning his &s;pou&s;e; for the purpo&s;e, it appears,
of marrying a younger wife. In Augu&s;t 1765, Patrick
Ogilvy and Catharine Nairne were convicted of the crimes
<PB N="458" REF="517">
of ince&s;t and poi&s;oning her hu&s;band, who was Ogilvy's bro|ther.
The catalogue may properly be clo&s;ed with the no le&s;s
atrocious ca&s;e of Mathew Hay, convicted at Ayr, in May
1780, of poi&s;oning and attempting to poi&s;on a whole family;
one of whom, the per&s;on chiefly meant to be de&s;troyed, was
pregnant by him at the time. She, her &s;i&s;ter, and her &s;i&s;ter-in-law
&s;urvived, though grievou&s;ly injured in their health;
but her father and mother died.</P>
<P>To bring a ca&s;e under the de&s;cription of murder by poi|&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Murder by Poi&s;on.</NOTE>
it is not indi&s;pen&s;able that the &s;tuff or &s;ub&s;tance admi|ni&s;tered
be of that kind, which is ordinarily known and di|&s;tingui&s;hed
as a poi&s;on; if the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e yield
pregnant evidence, on the whole, of the pannel's intention
to de&s;troy by means of it. Which may not only appear
from the known quality and common operation of the
thing, (as where ar&s;enick is given or verdigri&s;e); but al&s;o
from the exce&s;&s;ive quantity, or the frequent repetition of the
do&s;e, being of a &s;ub&s;tance &s;uch as hemloc, tartar emetic, and
many others, which are u&s;ed as medicines: and may al&s;o
appear from the age or the condition of the per&s;on to whom
the compo&s;ition is applied; as if a few drops of laudanum
are given to a new-born infant, or if a per&s;on, for &s;ome
&s;light complaint, is made to take large and repeated do&s;es
of the very medicine, the mo&s;t &s;uited to increa&s;e and aggra|vate
it into a mortal illne&s;s. How unlikely &s;oever &s;uch a thing,
it did once happen:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 16. and Feb. 8. 1676.</NOTE> I refer to the ca&s;e of George Clerk,
John Ram&s;ay, and William Kennedy, to which Mackenzie
alludes, but without giving a full account of it. Clerk and
Ram&s;ay were &s;ervants to John Ander&s;on, merchant in Edin|burgh;
Kennedy was an apothecary's apprentice; and the&s;e
three had con&s;pired to rifle Ander&s;on's hou&s;e, and to kill
him by poi&s;on, for their greater &s;ecurity of the &s;poil. The
<PB N="459" REF="518">
&s;ea&s;on happened to be &s;ickly, and a flux was prevailing in the
town. And this opportunity they took advantage of, to
admini&s;ter &s;uch medicines to him in his drink and victuals, as
might bring that complaint on him; which accordingly in a
&s;hort time en&s;ued. They next gave him a potion, to lay him
a&s;leep; and while he was in that &s;tate, they broke into his repo|&s;itories,
and plundered him of money, jewels, and other effects,
to a con&s;iderable amount. Contrary, however, to their ex|pectation,
the di&s;ea&s;e appeared to abate, and the man to be
in a way of recovery; which made it nece&s;&s;ary for them
to admini&s;ter &s;till more violent purgatives, &s;uch as might
in&s;tantly wa&s;te and de&s;troy him. One do&s;e appears to have
been given on a Saturday morning, another on the evening
of the &s;ucceeding Sunday, and early on the morning of Mon|day
he was dead. A libel laid for theft and murder upon
the&s;e grounds, was found relevant again&s;t Clerk and Ram&s;ay.
The jury found them &startq;guilty of the theft, and al&s;o guilty
of de&s;igning&endq; (that is con&s;piring), &startq;to di&s;patch John An|der&s;on
the defunct, and giving him powders and jallops to
that effect.&endq; They were condemned and executed ac|cordingly.
With re&s;pect to Kennedy, who furni&s;hed the me|dicines
and received part of the plunder, a debate en&s;ued on
the relevancy of the libel; and in the end, after he had lain
twenty months in goal, the Court &s;aw cau&s;e to bani&s;h him
on his own petition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 30. 1677.</NOTE> without pronouncing any interlocutor
on the charge.</P>
<P>5. THE crime of parricide al&s;o,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Pains of Parricide.</NOTE> is one of tho&s;e which find
a fit place in the li&s;t of aggravated murders; being &s;uch, of
which the laws of all countries have agreed in te&s;tifying their
abhorrence, by denouncing &s;ome extraordinary puni&s;hment for
the per&s;on, who &s;hall be convicted of &s;o wicked and unnatu|ral
<PB N="460" REF="519">
a deed. What our Legi&s;lature has fixed on for that pur|po&s;e,
is a total corruption, (contrary to our ordinary cu&s;tom), of
the convict's blood; &s;o as that all his po&s;terity may &startq;be di&s;|heri&s;ed
in all time hereafter, fra their lands, heritages, tacks,
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions;&endq; which are to devolve on the next collateral
relations, in the &s;ame manner as if the direct line had failed.
This is ordered by the &s;tatute 1594, ch. 224. with re&s;pect to
him, &startq;that has &s;laine, or &s;hall hereafter &s;lay his father or
mother, gude&s;ir or gudedame.&endq; Mackenzie has given his
opinion, that the&s;e terms are not to be extended to the kill|ing
of a father or mother by affinity. And indeed, be|&s;ide
the rea&s;ons which Mackenzie has given, there is this
other, that in them&s;elves the relations by alliance are not in
the &s;ame degree of awe, reverence, and &s;anctity as the natu|ral;
on which account, in the con&s;truction of the &s;tatute
again&s;t beating of parents, which u&s;es the &s;ame terms of
<HI>father and mother,</HI> it has been found<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Ca&s;e of Brown and Chalmers, July 18. 1735.</NOTE> that they do not
include father nor mother-in-law. The &s;ame author has
&s;aid<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Tit. Parricide, No. 3.</NOTE>, that though not <HI>in terminis</HI> &s;o expre&s;&s;ed, the &s;ta|tute
may however reach the ca&s;e of the parent killing
the child. But, be&s;ide the general rule again&s;t extending
any penal law by implication, there &s;eems rea&s;on to doubt
this from the very nature of the &s;tatutory pains, which
are not &s;uitable to that &s;ituation, and would be attended
with the ab&s;urdity of di&s;inheriting the grand-child, in the
ca&s;e of the murder of its father by the grand-father. Nei|ther
has this opinion that &s;upport from the authority of the
Roman law, which Mackenzie has &s;uppo&s;ed. For though the
&s;laughter of a child, and al&s;o of &s;ome other relations, was
<PB N="461" REF="520">
known by the name of parricide in the Roman &s;y&s;tem; yet
the peculiar pains of parricide, by drowning the convict
&s;ewed up in the &s;ame bag with a dog, a viper, and an ape,
were confined to the ca&s;e of proper parricide by the murder
of father, mother, or other relation in the direct line of a&s;|cendants<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Dig. ad L. Pomp. L. 9. No. 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>UPON the whole,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Do they reach natural Chil|dren.</NOTE> Mackenzie inclines to the &s;evere con|&s;truction
in the ca&s;e al&s;o of natural children; becau&s;e, (&s;ays
he), this is a crime again&s;t nature. But what he alleges on the
other &s;ide &s;eems to be the better rea&s;on; that they ought not
to be &s;ubject to the di&s;advantages of a &s;tate, whereof they
do not enjoy the benefits. And if this be a &s;ound plea, it
applies equally to the ca&s;e of the &s;laughter of either parent;
&s;ince, how certain &s;oever the natural connection with the
mother, the ba&s;tard child does not inherit of her, nor of
any per&s;on through her. It is always to be remembered,
that the que&s;tion is not about the per&s;onal puni&s;hment of the
murderer, but about a patrimonial con&s;equence to his i&s;&s;ue,
and this only introduced by a po&s;itive ordinance, which in
u&s;ing the terms <HI>father and mother,</HI> may $itly be under&s;tood
to mean only tho&s;e relations, which are acknowledged by the
law in other que&s;tions.</P>
<P>I HAVE found but four convictions of this mon&s;trous crime
in the record.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Convictions of Parricide.</NOTE> That of John Dick&s;on, elde&s;t &s;on of Dick|&s;on
of Belche&s;ter, April 30. 1591, who had &s;entence to be
broken on a <HI>row</HI> or wheel; that of Philip Standsfield, Fe|bruary
6. 1688, for the murder of his father Sir Philip Stands|field
of Newmills; that of William Rutherford, Septem|ber
7. 1694; and that of James Lauder, February 14. March 7.
1707. The two la&s;t per&s;ons had &s;entence to have the right
<PB N="462" REF="521">
hand &s;truck off, before execution. For what rea&s;on I know
not, the &s;tatute was not libelled in any of the&s;e in&s;tances.
One of the circum&s;tances &s;tated in the libel, and given in
evidence, in the ca&s;e of Standsfield, as a pre&s;umption of his
guilt, was that the dead body of his father bled afre&s;h when
the pannel touched it. He was, however, convicted on very
&s;trong pre&s;umptions.</P>
<P>6. IT yet remains to take notice of another &s;ort of mur|der,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Child Mur|der.</NOTE> which al&s;o pa&s;&s;es under the name of parricide, (in a loo&s;e
&s;en&s;e), and is of all murders the mo&s;t frequent; the murder
of a child by its own parent. This too, more commonly
happens by the hand of that one of the parents, who by
nature &s;tands mo&s;t attached to the child; but who&s;e affec|tions,
in the ca&s;e of an unlawful intercour&s;e, have to &s;trug|gle
with the al&s;o natural and &s;trong emotions of &s;hame,
the fear of relations, and too often the dread of want,
and the bitterne&s;s of treachery and de&s;ertion: A &s;truggle
the more difficult to be &s;u&s;tained, as me has to bear it
in &s;ecret, and for a length of time, and without any aid of
coun&s;el, or of comfort, to &s;upport her. Be&s;ides; this &s;ort of
&s;laughter is the more likely to be frequent, that it is not
like others, which excite immediate inquiry by the &s;udden
di&s;appearance of a known per&s;on, and are proclaimed by the
plain marks of violence upon the body, as &s;oon as it is found;
but on the contrary, by &s;teady denial of the pregnancy, and
a &s;ecret delivery, and concealment of the dead body, may be
placed beyond the reach, (in a great mea&s;ure), of ordinary le|gal
evidence to detect it. Add to this; that even wh$n the
body is di&s;covered, there is yet &s;o great a difficulty of a&s;cer|taining
whether there has been life in it<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See on this &s;ubject, an able paper of the late Dr William Hunter's, publi&s;h|ed in <HI>Medical Ob&s;ervations by a Society of Phy&s;icians in London,</HI> vol. vi. art. 26.</NOTE>; as well as that
<PB N="463" REF="522">
the new and tender life may be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed with &s;o little u&s;e
of violence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHILD MURDER.</NOTE> nay, without any violence at all, by bare ne|glect
and want of care of the helple&s;s infant; circum&s;tances
which at once tempt and reconcile to the deed.</P>
<P>IT appears that this evil had been much felt in the years
1680 and 1681;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Act 1690, as to Child Murder.</NOTE> of which period there are very numerous
trials for child-murder, and the&s;e, for the greater part, of
the kind above de&s;cribed, in which a jury could not con|vict,
without proceeding on &s;uch pre&s;umptions as are not
very de&s;irable to be tru&s;ted, in a matter of life and death.
To repre&s;s, therefore, the growing frequency of the crime,
and, as far as might be, to relieve juries from &s;o painful an
exerci&s;e of judgment, the Legi&s;lature added an enactment to
the &s;tatute-book, the act 1690, c. 21. which is framed on
the like plan that had been followed in &s;ome other coun|tries<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See 21&s;t Jac. I. c. 27. Edict of Henry II. of France, <HI>an.</HI> 1556.</NOTE>, and authori&s;es, or rather obliges, a jury to convict,
on proof of certain <HI>indicia</HI> or pre&s;umptions of guilt, with|out
direct evidence of murder. The circum&s;tances &s;elec|ted
for this purpo&s;e are, that the woman have conceal|ed
her &s;ituation during the whole period of pregnancy,
and have not called for help to her delivery, and that
the child is found dead, or is mi&s;&s;ing. Even before the
pa&s;&s;ing of this law, juries in many in&s;tances, though not
invariably, had been in the u&s;e of attending to the&s;e pre|&s;umptions.
Mo&s;t of the many convictions obtained in Ja|nuary
1681, were upon no other grounds, and the &s;ame is
true re&s;pecting &s;ome others of older date; that, for in&s;tance,

of the murder; &s;till the Court in tho&s;e days, were in
the u&s;e of con&s;idering the pre&s;umptions of concealment and
failure to call for help, and of inflicting &s;ome correction,
and &s;ometimes a &s;evere one, for this blameable cour&s;e of con|duct.
In this &s;ituation, Margaret Ram&s;ay had &s;entence to
be &s;courged, and to be bani&s;hed from the city of Edinburgh,
March 6. 1662. And on the 20th Augu&s;t 1662, (but with
this difference, that the jury expre&s;sly remitted the pre&s;ump|tions
for the con&s;ideration of the Court), Marion Law&s;on was
&s;entenced to be &s;courged, and to be bani&s;hed from the &s;he|riffdom
of Mid Lothian.</P>
<P>LET us now attend more particularly to the circum&s;tances
which the &s;tatute has required,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Child mu&s;t be ami&s;&s;ing.</NOTE> to place a jury in this, (as
it mu&s;t be admitted to be), di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ituation. It is the
fundamental circum&s;tance, that the woman be proved to
have been pregnant, and that the child be mi&s;&s;ing, or that the
dead body of a child be found, which is proved to be her child.
In the former ca&s;e, the proof of the pregnancy can only be by
tho&s;e &s;ymptoms in the &s;tate of the woman's per&s;on, which
<PB N="465" REF="524">
&s;how her to have been recently delivered, (or, as I find the
witne&s;&s;es often expre&s;s it, to be a <HI>green lighter woman</HI>).
The &s;tatute has pre&s;umed, that deci&s;ive evidence of the preg|nancy
may in this way be obtained, (el&s;e it could not have
ordered any thing in the ca&s;e of a child that is mi&s;&s;ing), and
that where the birth is a mere abortion, or has not been
foully dealt with, it will not be put out of the way. The
libel was accordingly &s;u&s;tained, (though, for a &s;eparate rea|&s;on,
the pro&s;ecutor only in&s;i&s;ted for an arbitrary puni&s;h|ment),
in the ca&s;e of Catharine Smith;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 3. &amp; 24. 1701.</NOTE> where the child was
&s;till mi&s;&s;ing at the time of trial, and no evidence was offered
of her having brought one forth, other than the condition of
her per&s;on. In the ca&s;e of the body being found, that evi|dence
may be &s;trengthened, if the woman, on being &s;hown
the body, has before witne&s;&s;es admitted it to be that of her
child; which confe&s;&s;ion, of it&s;elf, has always been held
&s;ufficient proof of that material fact again&s;t her. An argu|ment
was maintained to the contrary, but without &s;ucce&s;s,
in the ca&s;e of Margaret Crooks;<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 28. Aug. 5. Dec. 2. &amp; 4. 1718.</NOTE> who was convicted, and
had doom in terms of the &s;tatute. The verdict al&s;o again&s;t
Marion Govan, December 7. 1703, on which &s;he had &s;en|tence
of death, &s;pecifies her acknowledgment of the child
as the ground of conviction<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">&startq;Find, &amp;c. That Marion Govan pannel, is guilty of contravening the &s;aid act, by concealing her being with child, and not calling for help in the time of the birth, and after notice of her being brought to bed the child was found dead, <HI>which &s;he acknowledged to be her's</HI>&endq;</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT may here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Form of this Part of the Charge</NOTE> before proceeding, be proper to ob&s;erve,
that this alternative of the child being found dead, or being
mi&s;&s;ing, which was perhaps nece&s;&s;ary to be in&s;erted in the
&s;tatute, &s;eems in &s;ome in&s;tances to have crept al&s;o into the
<PB N="466" REF="525">
libel; which bears an alternative charge, that <HI>either</HI> the
child was found dead <HI>or</HI> was mi&s;&s;ing. The libel is in that
form in the ca&s;e of Helen Mar&s;hall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 15. 1720. Nov. 14. 1720. July 24. 1721.</NOTE> of Ann Brown, and of
Janet Hutchie. Now, (though in none of the&s;e ca&s;es was
any objection &s;tirred), the propriety of &s;uch a charge may
&s;eem to be doubtful. This is a matter of which the pro&s;e|cutor
never can be ignorant; and he is obliged to make his
charge definite and po&s;itive, as far as the circum&s;tances of
the ca&s;e allow him. Nor has the &s;tatute given him any
di&s;pen&s;ation in this re&s;pect, but only put two grounds of
accu&s;ation in his power, either of which he may employ,
as the ca&s;e happens to be. I have not ob&s;erved that this
fa&s;hion has been followed in later times.</P>
<P>THE &s;tatute has,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Conceal|ment of Preg|nancy.</NOTE> in the &s;econd place, required, that the
woman conceal her pregnancy during the whole &s;pace. And
touching this article a que&s;tion has ari&s;en, whether there be
need of an active and indu&s;trious concealment (if I may &s;o
&s;peak), on the part of the mother, as by the u&s;e of devices to
di&s;gui&s;e the &s;tate of her per&s;on, or by po&s;itive denial of her
pregnancy to &s;uch as inquire; or if it &s;atisfies the &s;tatute that
&s;he fails to reveal her &s;ituation; which, as a negative, will prove
it&s;elf. The former con&s;truction was argued for in the ca&s;e of
Margaret Pater&s;on, Augu&s;t 18. 1712, and of Helen Mar&s;hall,
February 15. 1720: But no regard was paid to the plea on
either occa&s;ion; as indeed it &s;eems to proceed on rather a
&s;trained interpretation of the words. That the contrary is
the &s;ettled doctrine, farther appears from the verdict and
judgment in the ca&s;e of Catharine Bell.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 7. 21. 22. 1726.</NOTE> The jury did not find
that this woman had concealed her pregnancy, but negative|ly,
thus, &startq;and do not find it proven that &s;he ever revealed
her being with child during the whole &s;pace of her being

&s;o.&endq; Upon which verdict, the Court proceeded to give
&s;entence of death.</P>
<P>IN this place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proof of Di&s;|clo&s;ure of the Pregnancy.</NOTE> we have farther to inquire concerning
the di&s;clo&s;ure which the law means to exact of the pannel,
Of what kind and degree it mu&s;t be, to &s;ave her from the
&s;action of the &s;tatute. One thing never was doubted; that
the law did not mean to exact of her an open proclamation
of her &s;hame, but only &s;uch a di&s;clo&s;ure, as in it&s;elf may be
&s;ufficient to take off the pre&s;umption of any evil purpo&s;e
again&s;t the child on its birth. If &s;he reveal therefore to
two or three per&s;ons, though the&s;e be even her own relations,
and though to all others &s;he per&s;i&s;t in denying her preg|nancy;
this has always been held &s;ufficient to avoid the pre|&s;umption
of the law. In particular, it had that effect in
the ca&s;e of Elizabeth Orrock,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 1. &amp; 3. 1715.</NOTE> where the jury found, &startq;That
during the &s;aid time of the &s;aid pannel Elizabeth Orrock's

pannel's &s;i&s;ter-german being one of the witne&s;&s;es<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">She &s;wore, that no one was pre&s;ent when the pannel revealed to her. There was but one other witne&s;s, who &s;wore to a different occa&s;ion, when the pannel had &s;poken ambiguou&s;ly.</NOTE>.&endq; In
the ca&s;e, al&s;o, of Elizabeth John&s;ton, tried on the 7th and
8th of the &s;ame month, the jury had in this matter given
credit to the a&s;&s;ertion of two witne&s;&s;es; one of whom &s;wore,
that &s;he revealed to him, in the pre&s;ence of &s;ome other per|&s;ons.
They found in general terms that &s;he had revealed;
and thus the woman's life was &s;aved.</P>
<P>IT is liable to more doubt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;clo&s;ure to one per&s;on; if &s;ufficient.</NOTE> and has been the &s;ubject of op|po&s;ite

expre&s;sly repelled the defence of di&s;clo&s;ure made to
one woman, at the di&s;tance of five weeks after the pannel
found her&s;elf with child. But another, and a later ca&s;e, was
at lea&s;t more humanely, and I think more &s;oundly judged,
the other way.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 28. and Mar. 3. 4. 1709.</NOTE> I mean the ca&s;e of I&s;obel Taylor, where
the jury &startq;find her being with child revealed to one wit|ne&s;s,
and as for the other defences not proven;&endq; where|upon
&s;he was <HI>&s;impliciter</HI> a&s;&s;oilzied. The di&s;clo&s;ure in this
ca&s;e was on the evening preceding the pannel's delivery, and
to a woman who gave her lodging in a barn, where &s;he was
delivered, alone, in the night. The truth &s;eems to be, that
the di&s;clo&s;ure to one per&s;on, if this per&s;on be &s;uch who is
under no temptation to keep the &s;ecret, may fairly be con&s;i|dered
as a revealing to many per&s;ons more.</P>
<P>BUT what &s;hall be &s;aid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;clo&s;ure to the Father, if &s;uffi|cient.</NOTE> if the one per&s;on to whom the
pregnancy is di&s;clo&s;ed, is the father of the child? On the
one &s;ide; the &s;tatute has not di&s;tingui&s;hed, but has &s;poken
of revealing in general terms. On the other; it &s;eems diffi|cult
to under&s;tand the law as having regard to any but that
&s;ort of di&s;clo&s;ure, which indicates the mother's purpo&s;e to
take care of her child, and puts it in &s;ome probability of
being &s;aved. Now this can hardly be &s;aid of a di&s;clo&s;ure to
the father alone, who may often be little di&s;po&s;ed to inte|re&s;t
him&s;elf in the matter, and who&s;e treatment of the mo|ther
it &s;ometimes is, that urges her to the crime. This point
<PB N="469" REF="528">
cannot be &s;aid to have yet received a deci&s;ion. It is
true, that in the ca&s;e of Marion Burnet, the Court &s;u&s;tained
&startq;the defence proponed by the pannel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 3. 1709.</NOTE> that &s;he revealed her
being with child to the father during the time thereof;
<HI>and</HI> that the child was not come to the full time when
born.&endq; But the&s;e defences are &s;u&s;tained jointly; and the
la&s;t &s;eems to be relevant, of it&s;elf. In the later ca&s;e of Marga|ret
Stewart,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 22. 1743.</NOTE> the father &s;wore po&s;itively that &s;he revealed to
him, but de&s;ired him to keep the matter to him&s;elf. The
jury, notwith&s;tanding, found her guilty; and &s;he was con|demned
to die. But in this way, (for any thing that ap|pears
on the record), the point was never judged of by the
Court.</P>
<P>IN whichever way this que&s;tion may afterwards be de|cided,
(if unfortunately it &s;hall again be tried), it will be
difficult to follow one invariable rule, (though the &s;tatute
has made no di&s;tinction,&mdash;but neither was it nece&s;&s;ary),
with regard to all di&s;clo&s;ure, to whom&s;oever made, or with
what&s;oever views. For what if the mother di&s;clo&s;e her
pregnancy to &s;ome one, and at the &s;ame time her re&s;olution
to de&s;troy the child when born, and endeavour to &s;educe
this confidant to approve and a&s;&s;i&s;t in the purpo&s;e? In&s;tead
of invalidating, &s;uch a di&s;clo&s;ure &s;trengthens the pre&s;ump|tion
again&s;t the mother. Is it neverthele&s;s to be held, that the
ca&s;e is thereby taken from under the operation of the &s;tatute?
Or again; is it to be held &s;ufficient, though &s;he only reveal it
to an idiot, or to one of &s;uch tender years, as cannot be &s;up|po&s;ed
to make any u&s;e of the information?</P>
<P>THIS que&s;tion al&s;o had been &s;tarted re&s;pecting the article of
di&s;clo&s;ure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mu&s;t the Di&s;clo|&s;ure be volun|tary.</NOTE> whether it mu&s;t be voluntary, or will be equal|ly
available though occa&s;ioned by con&s;traint; as for in|&s;tance,
<PB N="470" REF="529">
on examination before a Ju&s;tice of the Peace, or a
kirk-&s;e&s;&s;ion. There was a debate, but no deci&s;ion by the
Court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 18. &amp; 25. 1734.</NOTE> on this matter, in the ca&s;e of Jean Cowan, who proved
that the kirk-&s;e&s;&s;ion, entertaining &s;u&s;picions of her &s;ituation,
&s;ent a midwife to her, to whom, though with &s;ome diffi|culty,
&s;he was prevailed on to confe&s;s; and that &s;he af|terwards
renewed her confe&s;&s;ion to the kirk-&s;e&s;&s;ion them|&s;elves.
The jury found a verdict in her favour. And it
&s;hould &s;eem, rightly: becau&s;e all &s;uch confe&s;&s;ions are truly
voluntary; as well as the &s;ituation of the woman is the &s;ame,
and her temptation to de&s;troy the child is equally at an
end, by the divulging of her &s;hame, whether it happen in
the one way or the other. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, and as the
&s;tatute has not di&s;tingui&s;hed, it &s;eems not to make an ab&s;o|lute
difference in law, at what period of the pregnancy the
di&s;clo&s;ure be, whether in the beginning or towards the
clo&s;e; though the nearer it is to the period of delivery,
the &s;tronger is the pre&s;umption in her favour.</P>
<P>ANOTHER,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mu&s;t the Di&s;clo|&s;ure be po&s;itive. Mar. 12. &amp; 23. 1713.</NOTE> and a more delicate que&s;tion, occurred in the
trial of Margaret Ander&s;on: it relates to the degree of cer|tainty
with which the pannel mu&s;t expre&s;s her&s;elf in regard
to her &s;ituation. One witne&s;s &s;wore, &startq;That in the begin|ning
of May la&s;t the deponent a&s;ked Margaret Ander&s;on,
if &s;he was with child, and &s;he &s;aid <HI>&s;he thought &s;he was with
child:</HI> That there was nobody pre&s;ent, and from that
time till the child was born, &s;he never did any more ac|quaint
the deponent therewith.&endq; Another witne&s;s &s;wore,
&startq;That having &s;u&s;picion that the pannel was with child, &s;he
did about the middle of the month of May la&s;t inquire
at the pannel whether &s;he was with child or not, who
made an&s;wer, <HI>That &s;he did not know perfectly whether &s;he was
<PB N="471" REF="530">
with child or not, but that &s;he thought her&s;elf to be with child.</HI>&endq;
The jury, by a plurality of voices, &startq;found the libel proven,
in &s;o far as &s;he brought forth a child without calling for
help in the time of the birth. And found, that the two
witne&s;&s;es in the exculpation are not concurring, in &s;o far
as the pannel's declaration anent her being with child
was not po&s;itive to them.&endq; She was in con&s;equence
condemned to die. But I think her ca&s;e was rigorou&s;ly
judged, not only by the jury, but the Court al&s;o. For this
verdict, which is of the nature of a &s;pecial verdict, cannot be
&s;aid to bear an explicit finding, either way, on the article of
concealment, which is however a nece&s;&s;ary circum&s;tance of
the &s;tatutory crime; be&s;ide that the verdict does not &s;ay, ei|ther
that the child was mi&s;&s;ing or was found dead.</P>
<P>LAST of all;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Concealment mu&s;t be till the death of the Child.</NOTE> (though of this not many illu&s;trations can
be &s;uppo&s;ed to happen in practice), it &s;eems to be a nece&s;&s;a|ry
quality of the concealment, that it continue down to the
death of the child. For though the mother deny her preg|nancy
during the whole &s;pace, and be delivered without help;
yet if &s;he relent, and do not at that time de&s;troy the child,
but pre&s;erve, acknowledge, and &s;how it as her's; happen to it
afterwards what may, the inve&s;tigation of the alleged murder
is in this ca&s;e matter of common law, and in nowi&s;e &s;ubject to
the &s;tatutory rule. For according to the whole context of the
&s;tatute, and e&s;pecially by the words <HI>found dead or ami&s;&s;ing,</HI> it
is plainly intended for the one ca&s;e of murder done on an in|fant
unknown, and in the view of concealing that any &s;uch
has ever exi&s;ted. Whereas, in the ca&s;e now put, the mo|ther's
&s;hame is publi&s;hed, and more effectually than it would
have been by any declaration before the birth; her child is
known to have been born alive; is neither found dead, nor is
<PB N="472" REF="531">
mi&s;&s;ing <HI>on the birth;</HI> and cannot afterwards di&s;appear without
occa&s;ioning &s;u&s;picion and inquiry, as in the ca&s;e of any other
exi&s;ting per&s;on. A &s;ituation not very remote from this was
once the &s;ubject of trial. Chri&s;tian Oliphant, being with
child, had confe&s;&s;ed the fact to the family in which &s;he li|ved.
She brought it forth, however, in the fields, by the
river Tyne, &s;ecretly and una&s;&s;i&s;ted, and travelled away with
it to &s;ome con&s;iderable di&s;tance. A man &s;aw her with it,
alive, immediately after the birth; and at the place where
&s;he &s;lept that night, and remained next day, it was &s;een,
alive, by the people of the hou&s;e. Early, however, next
morning, &s;he went off from her place of lodging without
warning; and the body of the child was &s;oon after found in
a coal &s;ink. The indictment again&s;t this woman was laid
upon the &s;tatute; but was re&s;tricted, at calling, to an arbi|trary
puni&s;hment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 3. 1701.</NOTE> &startq;In re&s;pect the pannel was found with
the child alive.&endq; She emitted a qualified confe&s;&s;ion; was
convicted in terms of it; and had &s;entence to be &s;courged
and &s;et upon the pillory.</P>
<P>IN regard to the effect of di&s;clo&s;ure proved on the part of
the pannel;&mdash;this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;clo&s;ure of Pregnancy; its effect.</NOTE> at one period, was only to &s;ave her life,
leaving her liable to &s;ome inferior correction. The rea&s;on
was, that by the &s;uppo&s;ition of the ca&s;e, &s;he &s;till had wilful|ly
and wrongfully neglected to make the requi&s;ite provi|&s;ion
for her condition, or to u&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the delivery;
and in this had &s;hown a criminal indifference about the fate
of her child; expo&s;ing it to the plain ri&s;k of being de|&s;troyed
in the birth. By the ordinary &s;tyle, therefore, of in|terlocutor,
as u&s;ed for many years, it bore a clau&s;e in the&s;e
or the like words, &s;ubjoined to the finding of a relevancy
on the &s;tatutory charge. &startq;And for re&s;tricting the fore&s;aid
<PB N="473" REF="532">
relevancy to an arbitrary puni&s;hment, &s;u&s;tain the defence,
that the pannel, while &s;he was with child, did reveal

being with child, relevant to elide the capital puni&s;hment.&endq;
The in&s;tances are al&s;o numerous of arbitrary puni&s;hment,
and often a very &s;evere one, inflicted on a pannel, upon ver|dict
returned to that effect in her favour. Margaret Pater|&s;on,

adjudged to be &s;courged, and to be confined in the hou&s;e of
correction for &s;ix months, November 21. 1726. Many in|&s;tances
more might ea&s;ily be produced.</P>
<P>BUT though it be &s;ub&s;tantially ju&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;clo&s;ure of Pregnancy, its Effects.</NOTE> that one who has been
guilty of this mi&s;demeanour, &s;hould not be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with|out

it may &s;eem more que&s;tionable, whether it be a correct or
regular cour&s;e, thus to re&s;trict a libel laid upon the act 1690.
Such a libel is a charge of the crime of murder only; and
the terms of that enactment are, as it were, an interlocutor
of relevancy on the pre&s;umptions of guilt related in the
libel. If they be all proved, then mu&s;t the jury find the
pannel guilty of this con&s;tructive murder; and if any one
be wanting, as plain it &s;eems to be, that a verdict of <HI>not guilty,</HI>
<PB N="474" REF="533">
or <HI>not proved,</HI> ought to be returned. If, in&s;tead of this, the
jury return a &s;pecial verdict, finding &s;ome of the&s;e pre&s;ump|tions
proved, and &s;ome of them not, no judgment can regu|larly
pa&s;s upon it, but to a&s;&s;oilzie; becau&s;e the charge has no
relation to any inferior offence, but to the crime of murder
only, and to the &s;tatutory mode of proof, which is an in|&s;tituted
matter, and di&s;tinct from every other. The find|ing
of previous relevancies for arbitrary puni&s;hment on the
&s;everal pre&s;umptions &s;eparately, and in the view of verdict
being returned in the&s;e partial terms, &s;eems, therefore, to
have been &s;omewhat a loo&s;e and inaccurate practice. To
authori&s;e an interlocutor of that &s;ort, the libel, both in the
<HI>major</HI> and <HI>minor</HI> propo&s;ition, ought to bear a di&s;tinct charge
of the failure to call for a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the birth as a &s;eparate
offence, and liable to its proper penalty.</P>

later ca&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 4. 1758. and Jan. 10. 1759.</NOTE> either any puni&s;hment is inflicted, or a relevancy
to that purpo&s;e is found, on any of the many libels of this
&s;ort which have been in Court.</P>
<P>THE &s;tatute requires one thing more,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Failure to call Help to the Birth.</NOTE> to make out the pro|&s;ecutor's
ca&s;e; that the pannel have not called for, and
made u&s;e of, help and a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the birth. For if the
contrary be the ca&s;e; if &s;he reveal her pregnancy at this
critical period, when it would mo&s;t concern her to conceal
it, if &s;he had any evil purpo&s;e; &s;he has therein furni&s;hed
rea&s;onable evidence, that her previous &s;ilence was owing to
&s;hame or other excu&s;able motive, and not to any re&s;olution
again&s;t the child, which in the end &s;he does all that in her
lies to pre&s;erve: At lea&s;t, it is evidence that if ever &s;he har|boured
any &s;uch wicked purpo&s;e, &s;he repented before it
was too late. Be&s;ides; in this way, evidence is provided
of the actual condition of the child at the birth, whether
it be dead or alive.</P>
<P>THE chief que&s;tion which ari&s;es on this clau&s;e of the &s;tatute
is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Failure to call for Help to the Birth.</NOTE> whether, to <HI>elide</HI> the charge, the pannel has to prove that
&s;he both called for and made u&s;e of help in the birth? or if
it be &s;ufficient that &s;he &s;end for help, although in the end &s;he
do not make u&s;e of it? This &s;eems to be a que&s;tion upon
the ca&s;e; and which cannot be decided by any one inva|riable
rule. In general it is obvious, that the &s;tatute means to
require &s;uch a cour&s;e of conduct on the part of the mother,
as defeats the pre&s;umption again&s;t her from the concealment
of her pregnancy, and bears earne&s;t of a fair intention to|wards
the child, at the time of her labour. Put the ca&s;e there|fore,
<PB N="446" REF="535">
that having fallen in labour, the pannel di&s;clo&s;es her
pregnancy, till then carefully concealed, to the only per&s;on
who is in the hou&s;e with her at the time, and di&s;patches
her to &s;ome di&s;tance for a midwife. When they arrive,
the child is mi&s;&s;ing; and the mother refu&s;es to &s;ay what
has become of it. Certainly this ca&s;e is under the &s;tatute. For
though &s;he has called for a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the birth, and has there|by
revealed her pregnancy, it is in &s;uch a way as bears evi|dence
of her ho&s;tile di&s;po&s;ition to the child, and &s;hows that
her whole conduct was no other than a contrivance to
get rid of this trouble&s;ome witne&s;s, the more ea&s;ily to de|&s;troy
it. Or again; if, on their arrival, the me&s;&s;enger and
midwife find the door of the hou&s;e &s;hut again&s;t them, &s;o that
after much delay they are obliged to force entrance;
and if they find the body of the child concealed within the
hou&s;e, though not bearing marks of violence; here too the
real motive of the pretended call for a&s;&s;i&s;tance is &s;ufficient|ly
explained, to deprive the pannel of all benefit from this de|fence<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Elizabeth John&s;ton, being with child, went to the hou&s;e of I&s;obel Craw|ford, to whom &s;he revealed her condition. When near her time, &s;he &s;et out along with Crawford, on the road for England, meaning to bear the child there; but was taken ill by the way, and was delivered in the fields, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Crawford, who dre&s;&s;ed the child, and carried it back to, or at lea&s;t upon the way to her own hou&s;e; but &s;oon after, expo&s;ed it in the fields, where it was found deed. Libel was laid again&s;t the&s;e women, both on the act 1690, and at common law. Afterwards, the pro&s;ecutor re&s;tricted the libel to an arbitrary pain. In the&s;e terms, it was found relevant; and the women, being convicted, were condemned to be whipped and bani&s;hed, November 9. 1702. It &s;eems very doubtful, whether the act applies to &s;uch a ca&s;e at all; for it does not appear that the mother revealed, and took a&s;&s;i&s;tance, <HI>at fir&s;t,</HI> for her own &s;ake only, and with a view to de&s;troy the child upon the birth. If that had been the &s;hape of the ca&s;e, it would have been attended with more difficulty.</NOTE>.
The ca&s;e would not be more favourable to her, if on
coming to the hou&s;e they &s;hould find the door open, and the

fields, and the dead body in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or hidden there

<P>IF,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Failure to call for Help to the Birth.</NOTE> on the contrary, they get ready entrance of the hou&s;e,
and find the body of the child openly expo&s;ed in the &s;ame
apartment with the mother, who &s;ays that it was &s;till-born, or
that it peri&s;hed in the birth for want of help, the ca&s;e &s;eems as
clearly not to be within the &s;tatute. She has &s;hewn her di&s;|po&s;ition
to &s;ave the child at this critical time, how blameable
&s;oever before; and the body is here patent to immediate in|&s;pection,
whereby it may be judged,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 6. &amp; 12. 1700.</NOTE> whether her &s;tory be
true or fal&s;e. The ca&s;e of Agnes Scott was nearly of this
de&s;cription. She pleaded, that her pains came on her &s;ud|denly,
about a month before the full time, owing to exce&s;s
of work as a reaper in the fields; and that &s;he &s;ent a girl of
&s;even or eight years of age, the only per&s;on who was in the
hou&s;e with her at the time, for a midwife. Meanwhile, &s;he
was delivered, as &s;he &s;aid, of a dead and immature child,
which &s;he &s;howed to the midwife on her coming. In the&s;e
circum&s;tances, the Lord Advocate con&s;ented to her bani&s;h|ment;
which was a cour&s;e of lenity not &s;o common at that
time as it has &s;ince become.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 7. &amp; 14. 1726.</NOTE> A defence of the &s;ame &s;ort was
&s;tated for Elizabeth Stirling. She related, that being &s;eized

accordingly came to attend her; but that the&s;e per&s;ons ha|ving
left her, in the opinion that her time was not yet come,
&s;he was afterwards, in their ab&s;ence, &s;uddenly taken ill, and
was delivered of a dead child. The Court found it relevant,
in general terms, that &s;he called for help in the birth. But
the verdict on this point was again&s;t her<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">One of the mo&s;t &s;ingular ca&s;es in the record, is that of Jean Riddell, March 3. 1704.

THESE being the qualities which the &s;tatute has expre&s;sly
required in the charge, does it farther lie on the pro&s;ecutor to
prove,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mu&s;t the Child be proved to be ripe.</NOTE> that the child was a ripe child, produced at the full
time, and born alive? This is not by any means the rule.
It was, on the contrary, here,&mdash;in the difficulty of bringing
&s;uch a proof,&mdash;that the main inducement lay to the pa&s;&s;ing of
&s;uch a &s;tatute. If the body were mi&s;&s;ing, or were not found
until di&s;&s;olved by time, the pro&s;ecutor was excluded from all
the means of &s;howing that the child was born alive; and as
little could he prove the duration of the pregnancy, &s;o as to
&s;how that it might be a living birth, in a &s;ituation where the
fact it&s;elf of pregnancy is always &s;tudiou&s;ly concealed. To
relieve him, therefore, from this difficulty, and in con&s;ide|ration
that the blameable conduct of the woman, in conceal|ing
her &s;tate, and refu&s;ing a&s;&s;i&s;tance, is the cau&s;e of this
embarra&s;&s;ment, and is withal ground of &s;u&s;picion again&s;t
her; the &s;tatute has &s;hifted this di&s;advantage in point of
proof over to her &s;ide, and has made the inference again&s;t her,
that the child <HI>was</HI> born alive, and <HI>was</HI> murdered by her the
mother. This is plain from the expre&s;&s;ions and whole con|text
of the act, which declares, that in the&s;e circum&s;tances,
of concealed pregnancy and una&s;&s;i&s;ted birth, the mother
&s;hall be reputed the <HI>murderer</HI> of her child that is found dead
or is mi&s;&s;ing; in which it a&s;&s;umes and implies, that the child
has once been alive, to be de&s;troyed. Though it has occa|&s;ionally
been done, the pro&s;ecutor need not therefore attempt
any proof, le&s;s or more, to that effect, (a proof, which is in|deed
impo&s;&s;ible if the child be mi&s;&s;ing); nor need he even
aver in his libel, that the pannel was delivered at the full
time, or of a ripe or living child. Among the many inter|locutors
which have been pronounced on charges of this
&s;ort, (charges far more numerous than for any other kind of
<PB N="480" REF="539">
murder), there are, as far as I have ob&s;erved, but two, which
have any allu&s;ion to the maturity of the child; tho&s;e in the
ca&s;e of Jean David&s;on;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 11. 1729. Nov. 18. &amp; 25. 1734.</NOTE> and Jean Cowan; in both of which
the pro&s;ecutor, having proof of the maturity of the child,
had thought it proper to lay and circum&s;cribe his libel in that
manner; and in this the interlocutor naturally followed the
libel.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 1. 1715.</NOTE> But in the ca&s;e of Elizabeth John&s;ton, where the libel
did not &s;tate the duration of the pregnancy, nor affirm that the
child was ripe or born alive, or had come to that maturity
that it might have life, the exception taken on that ground was,
after full debate, repelled, and interlocutor was given in the
ordinary &s;tyle<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The pannel argues thus, &startq;That though the libel bears that the pannel con|cealed her being with child during the whole &s;pace, yet it does not conde&s;cend how long that &s;pace was. And no per&s;on can be tried for their life upon an indefinite libel. For if the concealment be for a month or two, it will not be contended that &s;uch a concealment, (although abortion had followed), would have fallen under the &s;aid act of Parliament. And yet that ca&s;e would have fallen under the generality of the pre&s;ent libel.

<P>BUT,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What if the Birth be proved to be unripe.</NOTE> although the Legi&s;lature have &s;een cau&s;e thus far to

follow, (nor would &s;uch a purpo&s;e be reconcileable to ju&s;tice),
that this &s;hall be an ab&s;olute pre&s;umption, which the pan|nel
may not redargue by any proof on her part. If the
body of the child has been found, and &s;he will undertake to
&s;how, by the clear opinion of tho&s;e who in&s;pected it, (being
competent judges of &s;uch a matter), that it was a mere
abortion, and of &s;uch a period that it never could have been
quick; certainly this is a relevant defence to elide the &s;ta|tute,
and which &s;he mu&s;t be allowed to prove. Indeed, even by
the older practice, it was &s;u$tained to lower the charge to an
arbitrary pain, if the pannel, without &s;aying that the child
never had quickened, alleged that it was unripe, and born
con&s;iderably before the full time: this probably, on a pre|&s;umption
that &s;he had been &s;uddenly taken with her pains, and
that the child could not have &s;urvived. In the ca&s;e, already

<P>IN regard to the per&s;ons who may be the objects of this &s;ort

concerning married women, whether they were meant to be

&s;tarted in the trial of Catharine Smith;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 3. &amp;24. 1701.</NOTE> and there, (but whe|ther
for this or for other rea&s;ons cannot be &s;aid), the pro&s;ecu|tor,

though it be probable, that the Legi&s;lature had chiefly in
view the ca&s;e of &s;ingle women, as tho&s;e who more frequent|ly
are under the temptation of concealment; yet there are
no words in the &s;tatute to authori&s;e the making an exception
in favour of a married woman, in any ca&s;e where the pre|&s;umption
will &s;uit her condition. Such it is, and one indeed
to which all the rea&s;ons of the law more e&s;pecially apply,
if &s;he become pregnant in the ab&s;ence of her hu&s;band.
<PB N="484" REF="543">
The libel was accordingly found relevant in the ca&s;e of
Margaret Dick&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 20. and Aug. 3 1724.</NOTE> which was of this preci&s;e de&s;cription;
and &s;he was convicted, and executed. It is even a po&s;|&s;ible
ca&s;e, that a married woman may be intere&s;ted to con|ceal
and de&s;troy her infant, though &s;he be cohabiting with
her hu&s;band at the time. This will be true, if &s;he was al|ready
with child to another per&s;on, and &s;ome months ad|vanced
in her pregnancy, at the time of her marriage; or if
&s;he have become pregnant during the ab&s;ence of her hu&s;|band,
and her time of delivery be &s;o near his return, that
the child cannot pa&s;s for his. But no ca&s;e of this extraordi|nary
de&s;cription has yet been tried, though I find that the &s;i|tuation
had once occurred. For on the 19th November 1711,
Barbara Taylor offers a petition for bail; which bears, that
&s;he &s;tood committed on a charge of murdering her infant,
brought to the world within five months after her marriage.
This petition is refu&s;ed, though her hu&s;band concurs in
it, and &s;ets forth, that he has no doubt of the child being
his, and that &s;he had revealed her &s;ituation to him &s;ome

of a libel on the act 1690;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charge on the Act 1690, does it allow Art and Part?</NOTE> if it be not that it is in the
&s;ingular &s;ituation in the law, of not admitting a charge of
<HI>art and part.</HI> The &s;tatute, in its whole &s;train and context,
has immediate relation to the mother alone, who is &s;uppo&s;ed
to be the one per&s;on in the world, that is con&s;cious of the
wicked purpo&s;e. If, therefore, the ca&s;e &s;hould happen, that
&s;he calls a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the birth, but on her own account
only, and not to pre&s;erve, but to de&s;troy the child; which
with the aid of this a&s;&s;ociate &s;he does; the a&s;&s;ociate mu&s;t
be tried by the ordinary rules of law, as for the actual mur|der.
<PB N="485" REF="544">
In one in&s;tance, a trial on the &s;tatute had, however,
been attempted. On the 14th November 1720, Anne Brown
was indicted on the act 1690, for the murder of her child;
and in the &s;ame libel, William Reid, the alleged father, was
indicted, &startq;as art and part with the &s;aid Anne Brown in the
&s;aid murder; at lea&s;t as acce&s;&s;ory to her bringing forth the
&s;aid child without calling for or making u&s;e of help, and
burying the &s;ame in the trench of the Citadel of Leith; in
&s;o far as,&endq; &amp;c. Certain circum&s;tances are afterwards
charged to infer his participation of the murder; &s;uch as his
&s;candalous conver&s;ation with the mother till near the time of
her delivery, his concealment of certain linens when &s;he
was impri&s;oned, and the like. This mode of charge was
objected to on the part of both pannels, as incompetent
and contradictory. And although, in his information, the
pro&s;ecutor abandoned the charge of art and part, and only
in&s;i&s;ted on the criminal conver&s;ation and concealment of
the linens, as &s;eparate crimes of their own fort, and relevant
to infer an arbitrary pain; yet, in the end, it was judged ne|ce&s;&s;ary
entirely to de&s;ert this libel, and indict the woman,
&s;ingly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 19. &amp; 30. 1720.</NOTE> of new. She was convicted and executed. But there
were no farther proceedings again&s;t Reid.</P>
<P>THE act 1690 concludes with a provi&s;ion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Promulgation of the Act 1690.</NOTE> very proper to be
made on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, for the due notification of this new
law to the inhabitants of the land, by publication of the act,
at the market-cro&s;s of the head hurgh of every &s;hire, and by
reading at the church of every pari&s;h. But it has repeatedly
been found, and e&s;pecially in the ca&s;e of Orrock and John&s;ton,
in March 1715, that it is not nece&s;&s;ary for the pro&s;ecutor to
aver that any &s;uch promulgation was made. It has been ar|gued,
that this provi&s;ion was at any rate only added <HI>ob ma|jorem
<PB N="486" REF="545">
cautelam,</HI> and not as a condition of the law. But con|cerning
this it is needle&s;s to inquire at the pre&s;ent day, after
the &s;tatute has for more than a century been put to exe|cution.</P>
<P>I HERE clo&s;e my analy&s;is of this rigorous edict. Yet it
is difficult to di&s;mi&s;s the &s;ubject, without taking notice of the
great number of capital &s;entences which have been pronoun|ced,
and I am afraid executed, on the &s;tatutory evidence
alone<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">In the ca&s;e of Anne David&s;on, July 5. 6. 1762, an eminent phy&s;ician and man-midwife, (Dr Young), &s;wore, that the &s;wimming of the lungs was not a cer|tain &s;ymptom of living birth: For that this would happen if the child gave but a &s;ingle &s;ob, though it died in the birth; and that it might al&s;o be the effect of putrefaction. Mr Alexander Wood, &s;urgeon, al&s;o &s;wore, that at the di&s;tance of eight or ten days, there are no certain &s;ymptoms by which phy&s;icians can &s;ay, whether the child was born to the full time or not. See the above quoted paper of Dr Hunter's, to the &s;ame effect.</NOTE>. Such, indeed, was the facility of conviction laid
open by the &s;tatute, as had at one time betrayed both pro|&s;ecutor
and Judges, into a degree of &s;lovenline&s;s, and of
indecent ha&s;te, in trials for child-murder, to which I find
nothing to be compared with re&s;pect to any other article
of our criminal &s;y&s;tem. Of this I need give no &s;tronger
proof than the practice, which was far from uncommon,
of carrying on &s;undry trials for child-murder, in one &s;it|ting,
and before the &s;ame a&s;&s;ize, who inclo&s;ed, and re|turned
their verdicts on the &s;everal libels into Court, at one
time<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">On the 3d March 1709, Be&s;&s;y Turnbell, I&s;obel Taylor, Margaret Inglis, each for murdering her own child, are &s;ent to one a&s;&s;ize, who convict two of them.</NOTE>. The late&s;t conviction on the &s;tatute, was that of
Anne Mackie, on the 5th of Augu&s;t 1776. Of late years,
in ca&s;es where the charge has been upon the &s;tatute only,
and which have otherwi&s;e been favourable to the pannel,
<PB N="487" REF="546">
it has been common for the pro&s;ecutor to con&s;ent to the pan|nel's
petition, praying to be bani&s;hed forth of Scotland, or
for other arbitrary puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>IN the way of Appendix to this of child-murder,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Expo|&s;ure of Infant Children.</NOTE> I &s;hall
here &s;ubjoin a few words concerning another very frequent
offence again&s;t infant children, and which too, may &s;ome|times
i&s;&s;ue in their death: I mean, the de&s;ertion and expo&s;ure
of them to the ri&s;k of what may happen. One can imagine
ca&s;es of expo&s;ure, (and &s;uch have already been taken notice
of), which &s;eem more properly to be ca&s;es of murder, if the
death of the infant &s;hall en&s;ue, than of any inferior offence.
But even where the child is not abandoned in &s;uch a way as
bears evidence of a re&s;olution to de&s;troy it; &s;till for the mo|ther
to de&s;ert her helple&s;s i&s;&s;ue, and expo&s;e it to any mate|rial
ri&s;k of peri&s;hing, though it &s;hould not die in con&s;e|quence,
and much more where it does, cannot but be con|&s;trued
a high crime. Indeed, if the child die, though only
accidentally, and by connection with the expo&s;ure; as if it
be expo&s;ed in a field, and is killed by the cattle treading on
it, or on a highway, and is cru&s;hed to death by a carriage
running over it; the crime &s;eems to be no other than a &s;pecies
of culpable homicide. Mary Graham was indicted for in|ce&s;t,
and for the expo&s;ure of her new born child, &startq;naked as it
came into the world,&endq; in a field of corn, where it was after|wards
found dead.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 21. 1703.</NOTE> The Court found this part of the charge,
(though certainly not very remote from murder), relevant to
infer an arbitrary puni&s;hment; and being convicted on her
own confe&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Her confe&s;&s;ion bore, &startq;That &s;he did expo&s;e and lay it out, naked as it was born, among&s;t the corn, immediately after the birth.&endq;</NOTE>, &s;he was &s;entenced to be &s;courged, and to be
<PB N="488" REF="547">
confined in the hou&s;e of correction, till the magi&s;trates of the
burgh &s;hould di&s;po&s;e of her.<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 9. 22. 23. 26. 1754.</NOTE> The ca&s;e of I&s;obel Kilgour,
which al&s;o i&s;&s;ued in a &s;entence of &s;courging and bani&s;hment,
was nearly of the &s;ame de&s;cription. In the month of March,
and about five of the evening, and in &s;evere weather, &s;he had
expo&s;ed her child, of about three weeks old, upon a &s;andy bank
near the road from Invere&s;k to Leith, and had there left it,
&s;tuffed into a rabbit's hole, (as appears on the proof), with its
head inwards, and the &s;and gathered up to the mouth of the
hole, &s;o that the body lay for ten or twelve days unob&s;erved.
The libel was laid as for murder<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">&startq;And there murdered the fore&s;aid child, by putting it into a hole in a &s;an|dy bank, near to the road leading from Invere&s;k to Leith, where it died im|mediately, or &s;oon thereafter. At lea&s;t, time and place fore&s;aid, &s;he left the &s;aid child <HI>upon the fore&s;aid ground,</HI> expo&s;ed to the cold at that &s;ea&s;on of the year, where it died in a &s;hort &s;pace thereafter, and in which place its dead body was found.&endq; It concludes thus: &startq;At lea&s;t, time and place fore&s;aid, the &s;aid child was murdered, <HI>or left upon the ground,</HI> expo&s;ed to the cold, without any help or a&s;&s;i&s;tance, whereby itdied immediately, or &s;oon thereafter.&endq;</NOTE>, and was found relevant, in
general terms, to infer the pains of law. The jury found
her &startq;guilty of <HI>expo&s;ing</HI> her child <HI>in terms of the libel,</HI> which
was the cau&s;e of the child's death.&endq; Now, the libel did
not relate &s;ome of the &s;trong circum&s;tances above mention|ed,
and bore an alternative charge, of <HI>putting the child in|to
a hole,</HI> or <HI>leaving it expo&s;ed upon the ground.</HI> On this re|ference
in the verdict to the libel, the Court could do no
other than adopt the more favourable account of an expo|&s;ure
<HI>upon the ground,</HI> and at no great di&s;tance from a high|way.
And thus the pannel's life was &s;aved.</P>
<P>I HAVE followed the example of Mackenzie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Self-Murder.</NOTE> in re&s;er|ving
&s;elf-murder (though there is very little to be &s;aid on
it), as the &s;ubject of a &s;eparate article; being an offence,
<PB N="489" REF="548">
of a nature quite di&s;tinct from any other in&s;tance of ho|micide.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SELF MURDER.</NOTE>
Though it may be contrary to popular belief, there
&s;eems to be no law, nor practice<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See on this head the judicious opinion given in the ca&s;e of Mungo Camp|bell. Maclaurin, p. 531.</NOTE>, for inflicting any in|dignity
on the remains of tho&s;e unfortunate per&s;ons, who
fini&s;h their cour&s;e in this unnatural way. But according
to all authorities<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">See Skene's Treati&s;e of Crimes. Craig, lib. 1. dieg. 16. No. 32.; lib. 3. dieg. 6. No. 18.</NOTE>, the ordinary patrimonial con&s;equence
of homicide takes place again&s;t their executors, in the con|fi&s;cation
of all their moveable goods; which is made effec|tual
on e&s;tabli&s;hment of the fact, in an action of declarator
before the Supreme Court. Craig has mentioned the ca&s;e of
Thomas Dobbie, in which it was judged, that even the plea
of madne&s;s is not relevant to hinder this penalty from taking
place, &startq;<HI>Neque in&s;aniae objectio recepta, cum nemo &s;anus id face|ret.</HI>&endq;
But this &s;eems to be an in&s;ufficient rea&s;on; and all
later authorities have held that judgment to be wrong.</P>
