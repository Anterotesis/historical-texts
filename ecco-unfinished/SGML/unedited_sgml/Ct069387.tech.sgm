<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE following Work &s;eems to have
as little need of a Preface as any
of the kind that has been pub|li&s;h'd
in this Age: It is hoped it
is it &s;elf but a Preface, or Intro|duction
to &s;ome larger and fuller
Hi&s;tory, that may, by better Hands, <HI>&s;ome time
or other,</HI> do Ju&s;tice, not to the Church of <HI>Scot|land</HI>
only, but to the Memory and Families of
the particular Sufferers and Confe&s;&s;ors, who have
&s;acrificed them&s;elves in Defence of Religion, in
that Part of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>It is a moving Reflexion, that the&s;e larger and
fuller Accounts have been &s;o often promi&s;ed, and &s;o
long ago undertaken by &s;everal able and Worthy
Hands, and that yet nothing has been fini&s;hed, in
a Cau&s;e wherein Hi&s;tory is &s;o much in debt to
Truth; me &s;ee no full Account yet given, and 'tis
to be feared will not be given in our Age.</P>
<P>This Con&s;ideration has made an officious Stranger
concern him &s;elf in the Work; he could not bear to
think, that the Memory of the mo&s;t glorious Scene
<HI>of Action,</HI> and the mo&s;t di&s;mal Scene of <HI>Suffer|ing,</HI>
which the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> has pa&s;&s;ed
<PB REF="3">
through, &s;hould lie buried in their own A&s;hes, and
not a Man to be found who would effectually em|ploy
him&s;elf, and &s;et &s;eriou&s;ly about the Work of
ran&s;oming things of &s;uch Con&s;equence from the
Grave of Forgetfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>For this Rea&s;on he has applied him&s;elf, by <HI>Books,</HI>
by ju&s;t <HI>Authorities,</HI> by <HI>Oral-Tradition,</HI> by <HI>li|ving
Witne&s;&s;es,</HI> and by all other rational Means,
to make him&s;elf &s;ufficiently Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Matters
of Fact;</HI> at lea&s;t to furni&s;h out Memoirs, tho' not a
perfect Mi&s;tory, of the&s;e Things; and to endeavour to
re&s;tore the general Knowledge of the&s;e great Tran&s;|actions
to the U&s;e of Po&s;terity, till &s;ome more large
and particular Account of the&s;e things &s;hall appear.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;ay nothing to the Performance, but this, that
I have endeavoured carefully to adhere to Truth of
Fact, and to have it told &s;o evidently and clearly,
that it may not be mi&s;under&s;tood by the Ignorant, or
mi&s;repre&s;ented by the malicious Part of Mankind in
Ages to come.</P>
<P>There is a Mi&s;take in the Paging, and a great
Breach made in the Figures between the Second and
Third Parts of this Work, which may make &s;ome
&s;ugge&s;t there is &s;omething omitted; but the Reader
is de&s;ired to ob&s;erve, that there is no Breach of the
Story, and that the Reading goes on without Interru|ption,
tho' the Figures &s;eem to be a little confu&s;ed,
which were occa&s;ioned only by the Mi&s;take of the
Printers.</P>
<P>The Author recommends the Work to the Candor of
impartial Readers; and if any Mi&s;takes are to be
found, tho' he has been critically careful to avoid
them, he de&s;ires they may be placed to the Account
of a di&s;intere&s;ted Zeal to do Ju&s;tice and Service to
the People of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to a Cau&s;e which he had
too much at Heart to let lie neglected any longer,
how many Imperfections &s;oever might happen in his
Performance.</P>

<P>_WHOEVER enquires narrowly
into the Subject I am now entring
upon, I mean the Church of <HI>Scot|land,</HI>
will find it a meer <HI>Terra
incognita,</HI> a va&s;t Continent of hid|den,
undi&s;covered Novelties; and
will find him&s;elf &s;urpri&s;ed, to the la&s;t Degree, that
Things &s;o near us &s;hould be &s;o entirely hid from us.</P>
<P>Not that there is any thing mon&s;trous or un|heard
of in the Con&s;titution or Circum&s;tances of
<PB N="2" REF="5">
this Church, much le&s;s in her Profe&s;&s;ion and Pra|cti&s;e;
but that &s;he has been repre&s;ented to the
World in &s;o many mon&s;trous Shapes, dre&s;t up in
&s;o many <HI>Devil's Coats,</HI> and <HI>Fool's Coats,</HI> charg'd
with &s;o many Here&s;ies, Errors, Schi&s;ms, and An|tichri&s;tiani&s;ms
by the Mob of this &s;landering Ge|neration,
that when a Man comes to view her in
her original Reformation, her &s;ub&s;equent Settle|ment,
her many Revolutions, Convul&s;ions, and
Cata&s;trophe's in her &s;ubjected, per&s;ecuted State,
and now in her glorious Re&s;troration and E&s;ta|bli&s;hment,
nothing can be more wonderful in
humane Affairs, than to &s;ee how Mankind has
been impo&s;ed upon about her, and with what
Front the Ab&s;urdities charg'd on her could be
broach'd in the World.</P>
<P>When we view the Soundne&s;s and Purity of her
<HI>DOCTRINE,</HI> the Strictne&s;s and Severity of
her <HI>DISCIPLINE,</HI> the Decency and Order
of her <HI>WORSHIP,</HI> the Gravity and Maje&s;ty
of her <HI>GOVERNMENT:</HI> When we &s;ee
the Mode&s;ty, Humility, and yet Steadine&s;s of
her A&s;&s;emblies; the Learning, Diligence, and
Painfulne&s;s of her Mini&s;ters; the awful Solem|nity
of her Admini&s;tration; the Obedience, Se|riou&s;ne&s;s,
and Frequency of her People in hear|ing,
and univer&s;ally an Air of Sobriety and Gra|vity
on the whole Nation; we mu&s;t own her to
be, at this Time, the be&s;t regulated, national
Church in the World, without Reflection upon
any of the other Nations where the Prote&s;tant
Religion is e&s;tabli&s;h'd and profe&s;s'd.</P>
<P>I am not comparing the Con&s;titutions of
Churches, neither &s;hall I enter into an invidi|ous
Compari&s;on here between the Circum&s;tances
of this Church and the Church of <HI>England.</HI>&mdash;Let
them fight that Quarrel out with the Pen
and Ink by them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="6">
But this, I believe, I may challenge the Na|tions
for, in the Name of the Church of <HI>Scot|land,</HI>
That as to obeying their Con&s;titution, as to
pre&s;erving the Purity of Doctrine and Wor&s;hip,
as to enacting good Laws, and maintaining a
&s;trict Ob&s;ervance of them, no Body of Men in
the World come up to them.</P>
<P>I know the Church of <HI>England</HI> have Canons
and Injunctions, which when People defend her,
they argue from; and tho&s;e Canons and Injuncti|ons
are far le&s;s liable to Objection, than tho&s;e
who only gue&s;s by her Practice, may imagine:
For, when they come to examine how her Mini|&s;ters
obey tho&s;e Canons, and how they are pu|ni&s;h'd
when they break them, <HI>Hic labor, hoc o|pus,</HI>
This is the mo&s;t mon&s;trous thing in the
World, and confirms what was &s;aid by a Divine
of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> (viz.) That no Nati|on
or Church, in the&s;e Parts of the World,
have &s;o good Laws &s;o ill regarded as they<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See Dr. <HI>Edward's</HI> Te&s;timony to the Di&s;cipline of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in his Sermon on the Union.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Nor &s;hall I examin here whence a Thing &s;o
ju&s;tly &s;candalous to the Church of <HI>England</HI> pro|ceeds;
'tis not the Work of this Piece, in which
the State of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> not of the
Church of <HI>England,</HI> is my Theme: But when
I have &s;hewn therein the Advantages, which the
Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> reaps by a Strictne&s;s of Di&s;|cipline,
peculiar to her &s;elf, and that Di&s;cipline
exactly executed in every Part; and how by
this &s;he &s;eems qualified to be the Chinch in the
World, the harde&s;t to be invaded by Errors and
Schi&s;ms, and perfectly invulnerable by Here&s;ies
and Corruptions, we mu&s;t be very blind in <HI>En|gland,</HI>
if we do not &s;ee, that the Slackne&s;s and
<PB N="4" REF="7">
Remi&s;ne&s;s in Di&s;cipline is the only Door at
which all the notorious Errors and Here&s;ies,
now &s;warming in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Church, are crept
in; &s;uch as Ariani&s;m, Sociniani&s;m, Arminiani&s;m,
Sceptici&s;m, Athei&s;m, Dei&s;m, and the new ridi|culous
Corruptions, Notions, and Novelties of
<HI>Dodwell, Coward, A&s;gill,</HI> and Others, who call
them&s;elves of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and are
daily filling the World with Ab&s;urdities in Re|ligion,
not fit to be &s;uffered in a Prote&s;tant
Church or Government.</P>
<P>Did the Convocation of the Church of <HI>En|gland</HI>
do their Duty, who often times &s;it long,
and do little; did they, in Time, check the
Growth of the&s;e Things; did they call in the
Aid of the Civil Authority, to curb the Exor|bitance
of the Pre&s;s, and exerci&s;e their Eccle&s;i|a&s;tick
Authority in that of the Pulpit; in &s;hort,
were they as exact in their Di&s;cipline, as grave
in their Cen&s;ures, and as &s;trict in the Pur&s;uit of
&s;uch Things as the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> Errors
and Here&s;ies would creep, like other venomous
Creatures, upon the Ground, grovel in the Du&s;t,
and come out but in the Dark; &s;uch Crimes
would be acted as Crimes, and the Guilty would
hide them&s;elves, like <HI>Adam,</HI> among the Bu&s;hes;
and not bully Religion, and affront God Al|mighty
to his Face; laugh at Church Di&s;cipline,
and banter Civil Ju&s;tice as now they do every Day.</P>
<P>But in <HI>Scotland,</HI> I take upon me with Boldne&s;s to
a&s;&s;ure the World, it is not &s;o; no Error broach|ed,
lies brooding like hot Embers laid among
dry Buildings, neglected till it &s;ets all in a
Flame: No ignorant Per&s;on can gain Admit|tance
to, no immoral Per&s;on obtain Connivance
in the Pulpit; no Error there e&s;capes Cen&s;ure,
no Cen&s;ure dies there for Want of Pro&s;ecution.
<PB N="5" REF="8">
If any Breach be made, the Church Judicatories
never fail to keep it in the &s;tated Forms of
Proceeding, where it cannot &s;leep; the guilty
Per&s;on mu&s;t be brought either to Repentance
or to Puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>If there is any Breach in this Order, any
Stop in the free Exerci&s;e of their Authority, or
any Interruption to the full Extent of the
Church's Power in Cen&s;ure, it proceeds either
(1.) from the exorbitant Power of the Gentry and
Nobility, who, often e&s;pecially when their own
Guilt is the Que&s;tion, &s;tand out to Extremity
again&s;t Church-Cen&s;ures, and think them&s;elves
too great for the Authority of the Eccle&s;ia&s;tick
Judicatories.&mdash;Or (2.), from the Loo&s;ene&s;s of
the Epi&s;copal Di&s;&s;enters, who, as they &s;eparate
in Wor&s;hip, &s;o they would be under&s;tood to
be excu&s;ed from Di&s;cipline.&mdash;Of both which
I &s;hall &s;peak at large in their Place, and only
note it here, That even in both the&s;e Ca&s;es, there
are In&s;tances wherein the highe&s;t and mo&s;t ob|&s;tinate
have thought fit to &s;ubmit to the Di&s;ci|pline
of the Church, either convinc'd of its
Ju&s;tice, or loath to have the ju&s;t Reproach of
the Oppo&s;ition entailed upon their Po&s;terity.&mdash;In
which Ca&s;e <HI>Scotland</HI> is not without In&s;tances,
where her Noblemen have accepted a Rebuke
for the Breaches of their Morals in the open
Congregation.&mdash;But of all this I &s;hall be more
particular in its Place.</P>
<P>In the&s;e Judicatories the admirable Order of
Proceeding is &s;uch, that it &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible any
Man can be oppre&s;t; for he is able to appeal
&s;o often, the Cau&s;e &s;hall be heard &s;o often, and
by &s;uch different Judges, that he cannot fail of
Ju&s;tice. On the other Hand, the Subordination
of Judicatories is &s;uch, and the Proceedings &s;o
<PB N="6" REF="9">
nicely accounted for by the Kirk-Se&s;&s;ions to the
presbyteries, by the Presbyteries to the Pro|vincial
Synods, and by the Synods to the Gene|ral
A&s;&s;emblies, that there can no Mi&s;take pa&s;s
unob&s;erved, no Complaint can pa&s;s unheard, no
Grievance unrectified.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not in&s;i&s;t on the Particulars here; be|cau&s;e
I &s;hall give it at large in the Scheme I pur|po&s;e
to draw of the State of the&s;e Judicatories
in this Church; to which I refer.</P>
<P>But what I am upon here is, that by this
Means you have the fewe&s;t Breaches made upon
this Church by the Defection or Degeneracy of
either Mini&s;ters or people, among them&s;elves, of
any Church in the World; and this, I believe,
will very remarkably appear in the &s;ub&s;equent
Sheets.</P>
<P>To give a true and conci&s;e Scheme of the State
of this Church, it will be needful to go back to
its original Con&s;titution, which I &s;hall only a|bridge,
and take no more of it, than is needful to
hand down a right under&s;tanding of its Cir|cum&s;tances
to the pre&s;ent Time. And this is
the De&s;ign of the&s;e Memoirs.</P>
<P>It began to reform from Popery in the Year
1557, being &s;ometime before the Reformation in
<HI>England.</HI> Not but that the Seeds of the Prote&s;tant
Religion were &s;own, and the Prote&s;tant Doctrine
&s;pread very far in private even before that; as
may appear by the &s;everal Confe&s;&s;ors for the
Truth, who were put to Death under the Ad|mini&s;tration
of the Queen-Regent, by the A&s;&s;i||&s;tance
and particular Fury of the Cardinal <HI>Be|ton,</HI>
of which pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>But this will be farther evident by entring into
an Examination of Matters in <HI>England.</HI> For after
the Death of <HI>James</HI> V, <HI>Henry</HI> VIII, K. of <HI>England,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="10">
&s;ending Amba&s;&s;adors openly to treat of a Mar|riage<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">King <HI>Hen. VIII.</HI> &s;ont Ja. 5th Books, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> See <HI>Buch.</HI> lib. 14. fol. 63.</NOTE>
for his Son, with the Queen of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
the &s;aid Treaty and Marriage being propo&s;ed in
Parliament, was &s;o openly contradicted by the
Prie&s;ts in general, with the Queen Dowager,
a <HI>French</HI> Woman, and Cardinal <HI>Beton</HI> at the
Head of them, that the Cardinal was con&s;ined
till the Que&s;tion was put in the parliament.</P>
<P>And tho' when the Cardinal was thus remo|ved,
the Matter was &s;oon concluded, yet the
Cardinal making his E&s;cape out of Pri&s;on, he
and the Popi&s;h Faction &s;o ordered Affairs that
the Articles could never be executed, nor the
Ho&s;tages, agreed on, obtained.</P>
<P>A cruel War followed on this, the King of
<HI>England</HI> re&s;enting all the&s;e Indignities: Which
War, and the Calamities it brought with it, to|gether
with the Confu&s;ions in the Regency of
the Earl of <HI>Arran,</HI> occa&s;ioned by the Policy
and Cruelty of the Cardinal <HI>Beton,</HI> gave the Peo|ple
a greater liberty than otherwi&s;e they would
have had; &s;o that the Prote&s;tant Religion, then
particularly called <HI>Lutherani&s;m,</HI> got a great deal
of Ground; and not only were the common Peo|ple
enclined to it, but a great many of the No|bility
and Gentry of <HI>Scotland</HI> favoured the Re|formation:
Nay, &s;o far had it obtained, that
&s;ome Towns began to own it in Bulk: And <HI>Bu|chanan</HI>
records it, and from him I hand it
down to Po&s;teriry for the particular Honour of
the Town of <HI>Dundee,</HI> that they were the only
Town in <HI>Scotland</HI> that was then addicted to the

the Reformation, in that Town, but
fled to <HI>Perth.</HI></P>

a Woman and her Infant, becau&s;e &s;he would
not call on the <HI>Virgin-Mary</HI> when &s;he was in

farther into the <HI>Matter, and have retained their
better Knowledge to this Day.</HI></P>
<P>That the Popi&s;h Clergy apprehended a general
Revolution in the Affairs or Religion, and law
a &s;trong Inclination to that Change in the Peo|ple,
was apparent from their Vigilanee and
Subtilty in rejecting the Offer of an Intermar|riage
with <HI>England,</HI> fir&s;t made by King <HI>Henry</HI>
VIII, in the Time of <HI>James</HI> V of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and
afterwards their running headlong into a War

with <HI>England,</HI> rather than con&s;ent to match
their Queen, then an Infant, to Prince <HI>Edward,</HI>
afterwards <HI>Edward</HI> VI, King of <HI>England.</HI> The true
Rea&s;on of which appeared to be, lea&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Reformation &s;hould be impo&s;ed upon them.</P>
<P>This Ob&s;tinacy was &s;o great, as that had

among them&s;elves.&mdash;And yet the <HI>Scots,</HI> tho'
their Army was overthrown, and their Coun|try
over-run by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> rejected the Match,
and privily conveyed their young Queen into
<HI>France.</HI> And all this for fear of a Reformation.</P>
<P>This was all from the Subtilty of the Popi&s;h
Clergy, as is evident through the whole Cour&s;e of
the Hi&s;tories of tho&s;e Times.&mdash;The Prie&s;ts had in
vain oppo&s;ed the growing Reformation with the
unprevailing Remedies of Fire and Faggot: The

by the&s;e things, to defer the Reformation, I
mean, as a publick Action; they had Lei&s;ure
thereby to &s;ee the Defects of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Refor|mation,
which happened in the mean time, and
going a Step farther, to leave out &s;ome Things
which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> retained; and which, by the

as never to be altered to this Day: Such as the
Supremacy, pre&s;cribed Rites and Ceremonies,
and which they e&s;teem'd al&s;o a Defect, <HI>Epi&s;|copacy:</HI>
Which Things, as they began now

concerning the Model of Church Govern|ment,
which &s;hould be mo&s;t agreeable to Scri|pture-In&s;titution,
he brought over the Figure of a
Church as to Wor&s;hip, Di&s;cipline, and Govern|ment,
the &s;ame which we find now e&s;tabli&s;h'd.</P>
<P>It would be too long a Work for the&s;e Me|moirs
to &s;et down here the Beginning, Progre&s;s,
Manner, and I&s;&s;ue of the fir&s;t Reformation: It
may be &s;ufficient to note here the Heads of it,
and withal, the different Manner of it from that
in <HI>England,</HI> which produced that Effect mention|ed
above, <HI>viz.</HI> a differing Form of Settlement.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="15">
In <HI>England</HI> the Reformation, as to the Settle|ment
of it, began in the Crown, the &s;everal
Kings put the fir&s;t Hand to it: As 1. King <HI>Hen|ry</HI>
VIII, by dethroning the Pope's Supremacy,
demoli&s;hing the religious Hou&s;es, forbidding
Appeals to <HI>Rome,</HI> and the like. 2. King <HI>Edward</HI>
VI, by a general Overthrow of all the Popi&s;h
Hierarchy, ca&s;ting their Images out of the
Churches, their Ma&s;s, and all their <HI>Romi&s;h</HI>
Innovations out of their Wor&s;hip, dethroning
their whole Authority, and rooting out the
Remains of their Ceremonies from the Nation.</P>
<P>But this had two Effects.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That when King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII aboli&s;h'd the
Pope's Supremacy, his Principle at that time be|ing
rather Politick than Religious, he &s;et his
own Authority up in the &s;tead of it, calling him|&s;elf
&s;upream Head of the Church in all Things,
whether Eccle&s;ia&s;tical or Civil; a Thing &s;ince
made very ill u&s;e of, and improve'd to a Tyran|ny,
which neither in the Divine or Humane
Original of it could find any legal Foundation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That when King <HI>Edward</HI> rejected the Pon|tificate
of <HI>Rome,</HI> he yet erected a Prote&s;tant
Pontificate in its &s;tead, which being &s;oon oppo|&s;ed
by &s;ome of the mo&s;t eminent for Piety and
Wi&s;dom in the Reformation, quickly begot a
Divi&s;ion in the Church, which has &s;ince been
carried on to that Heighth, and encrea&s;ed to the
Magnitude which we &s;ee this Day.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. King <HI>Edward,</HI> and the fir&s;t Reformers,
when they came to the Matters of Wor&s;hip, did
not wholly de&s;troy the Model, but reform'd it
only; and tho' I am willing to believe they, to
the Extent of their Light, hone&s;tly de&s;ign'd to
leave out all that was &s;uper&s;titious and idola|trous
in the former, and did really believe it
<PB N="13" REF="16">
was &s;o; yet they thought them&s;elves obliged to
retain a Similitude of Form.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Nor do we &s;ince &s;o much object again&s;t the
Form, le&s;s again&s;t a Form in general; but a|gain&s;t
pre&s;cribing that Form as a Term of Com|munion.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the Three Heads which have &s;ince
cau&s;ed &s;o much Di&s;pute in <HI>England,</HI> made un|happy
Breaches in the common Charity, and
ri&s;en up to &s;uch large Divi&s;ions as we &s;ee at
this Day.</P>
<P>But to return to the <HI>Scots,</HI> their Reformation
began quite in another Manner.&mdash;The Know|ledge
of the Scriptures began the fir&s;t Step to it,
and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bible got in among the People ve|ry
quickly: Some eminent, for Learning, even
among the Popi&s;h Zealots, began to be enlight|ed
by the Reading the Word of God: And as
Knowledge is naturally diffu&s;ive, &s;o this Kind,
having an invi&s;ible In&s;tructor to &s;econd it, I
mean the holy Spirit of God, &s;pread &s;ecretly,
but &s;wiftly, through the Nation.</P>
<P>Among tho&s;e, whom it plea&s;ed God to make
u&s;e of as the fir&s;t In&s;truments in this glorious
Work, was <HI>George Wi&s;hart,</HI> and &s;everal others,
who became eminent: They were bold and &s;teady
Preachers of the Reformation, and the People
of all &s;orts became &s;o addicted to the Prote&s;tant
Religion, by their In&s;truction, that after the Re|gent,
by the In&s;tigation of Cardinal <HI>Beton,</HI> had
con&s;ented to the Martyrdom of that great
and good man Mr. <HI>Wi&s;hart, Buchanan</HI> tells us the
whole Nation began to<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><HI>Buch.</HI> lib. 15. fol. 163.

'Twould be endle&s;s to recite the Names;
Lives, and Death of the many Preachers who,
at fir&s;t, with the extreme&s;t Hazard, and with a
Con&s;tancy, even to Martyrdom, &s;pread the
reformed Doctrines through <HI>Scotland.</HI> It &s;uf|fices
to note, that in a few Years it had &s;uch Suc|ce&s;s,
that in general the whole Kingdom &s;eem|ed
to be touch'd with the Sen&s;e of the true
Religion, and not the common People only, but
the Nobility and Gentry embraced it with great
Zeal, Eagerne&s;s, and Re&s;olution; and in this
Ca&s;e the Affairs of the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;tood,
when the Regent was per&s;uaded by the <HI>French</HI>
Court to demit, and to re&s;ign his Government
into the Hands of the Queen Mother.&mdash;.</P>
<P>This Lady being wholly <HI>French</HI> and acted by
their Coun&s;els, &s;et her &s;elf with more Heat, than
Di&s;cretion, to &s;uppre&s;s the reformed Religion,
and, <HI>as &s;he f$attered her &s;elf,</HI> to extirpate the Begin|nings
of it out of <HI>Scotland;</HI> but &s;he found her
&s;elf mi&s;taken, it was now too late; the Thing
had taken too deep Root in the Hearts of the
People for her to ma&s;ter it.</P>
<P>However, for Two Years, Matters of Re|ligion
&s;lept, the Queen being married to
the Dauphin of <HI>France,</HI> the Regent taken up
by a War with <HI>England:</HI> And the Clergy,
tho' cruel and bloody enough, yet being baulk|ed
by the Murther of Cardinal <HI>Beton,</HI> (who was
&s;lain in his Bed-Chamber, as <HI>George Wi&s;hart</HI> had
<PB N="15" REF="18">
predicted, and ca&s;t out of a Window by <HI>Norman
Le&s;ley,</HI> Son to the Earl of <HI>Rothes,</HI> and his Follow|ers)
they wanted a Head to pro&s;ecute the Refor|mers
to Blood, and a Power to protect them in it.</P>
<P>All this while the Reformed held their pri|vate
A&s;&s;emblies, where they had their Wor&s;hip
in their own Language, and had frequent Con|ferences
upon religious Matters; for as yet they
had no publick Preaching: However, by this
Means the Work of Reformation &s;till &s;pead it
&s;elf, and took deep Root in the Nation.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t popular Di&s;covery this made in the
Minds of the Commonality was, in the City
of <HI>Edenburgh,</HI> when the Shrine of St. <HI>Giles,</HI> the
Patron of that City, was robbed of its Relicks,
which they had in &s;o much Veneration.</P>
<P>The 1&s;t of <HI>September,</HI> it &s;eems, was the Fe|&s;tival
of this tutelar Saint, when his Image was
to be carried in Proce&s;&s;ion about the City, and
the Queen Regent re&s;olved to be pre&s;ent at the
Solemnity: But when they came to look for the
Saint, he was plea&s;ed to &s;uffer him&s;elf to be &s;to|len
away, to the great Confu&s;ion of the Clergy,
who had pleased them&s;elves with the Expectati|on
of the Proce&s;&s;ion, and the Honour done them
by the Regent to grace the Show.</P>
<P>However, to make up the Matter as well as
they could, they made another Image to &s;et in
the Pageant, and began their Proce&s;&s;ion in the
u&s;ual Form.&mdash;After the Show had pa&s;&s;ed the
principal Parts of the City, and the Queen Re|gent
was retired, the Mob ro&s;e upon the Prie&s;ts,
and put an End to their Pageantry: For they
pulled St. <HI>Giles</HI> out of his Throne, which was
erected on the Shoulders of the Prie&s;ts, threw
his Saint&s;hip into the Dirt, and in &s;hort, the &s;a|cred
Image &s;uffered immediate Martyrdom. But
<PB N="16" REF="19">
the Prie&s;ts had no Mind to die with their Deity;
for they fled every Man as he could.&mdash;And yet
this they need not have done, for the Rabble of|fered
no Body any Injury but the wooden Idol,
which they broke all to pieces, and &s;o departed.</P>
<P>This, however, might give the Regent a Ta&s;te
of what Po&s;ture the Affairs of Religion were
in, if &s;he had plea&s;ed to have taken Notice of it.
However, &s;he countenanced the Prie&s;ts to go on
with all the per&s;ecuting Methods they could,
tho' every where they met with In&s;ults, Slights,
and Contempt from the People: As particularly
When citing <HI>Paul Meffen</HI> of <HI>Dundee</HI> before them,
and he not appearing, was intercommoned; that
is, every one was forbid to harbour, or relieve
him, or conver&s;e with him, on &s;evere Penalties:
which yet the brave Citizens of <HI>Dundee</HI> open|ly
di&s;regarded, and protected him, entertained
him in their Hou&s;es, and &s;ued to the Regent to
remit his Bani&s;hment.</P>
<P>But things were now coming to a greater
Height; for the A&s;&s;erters of the reformed
Religion re&s;olved not to bear any longer the
Oppre&s;&s;ions and Inva&s;ions of the Clergy, but to
demand their Liberty in a different Manner
from what had formerly been done.</P>
<P>They had calculated their Right fir&s;t, and
then their Strength: They found that if they
were proceeded again&s;t by Law, they could not
be hurt, for they had offended no Law; and if
their Enemies had recour&s;e to Arms, they were
more numerous than they, and would defend
them&s;elves. Upon the&s;e Re&s;olutions, &s;everal
were &s;ent abroad by their Brethren to concert
Mea&s;ures, and to form them&s;elves into &s;ome|thing
of a Body.</P>

<P>The Parliament &s;oon after this &s;at down,

Reformers pre&s;ented a Letter to them al&s;o,
including their Reque&s;ts, and annexed to it a
&s;olemn Prote&s;tation, which they demanded to
be regi&s;tred at the &s;ame Time that they deliver|ed
it.</P>
<P>The Regent's An&s;wer to this Prote&s;tation
was mild, and &s;uch as deceived the Reformers
for a while: Her An&s;wer was thus&mdash;<HI>Me will
remember what is prote&s;t. Me &s;al put good Order in

was a <HI>French</HI> Woman, and &s;poke broken <HI>En|gli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>The Regent all this while dealt cautiou&s;ly and

who dur&s;t make the&s;e Demands, mu&s;t have
&s;ome Pro&s;pect of Power to &s;upport them; and
&s;he dreaded the Tumults of the Rabble: She

particularly, to let them have their Wor&s;hip in
the vulgar Tongue, on Condition it &s;hould be
without Tumult, and that they &s;hould not preach
publickly in <HI>Leith</HI> or <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>
<P>For &s;ome time, it &s;eems, <HI>the Reformed</HI> con|tented
them&s;elves with this, and kept the In|junctions
of the Regent exactly; but the Prie&s;ts
were furious, to the la&s;t Degree, at the&s;e things,
and made all po&s;&s;ible Oppo&s;ition, till at la&s;t
they drove things to the Extremities which

followed, and pav'd the Way for their own
Overthrow.</P>
<P>They held their Meetings to con&s;ult for the
Suppre&s;&s;ing the Reformed, and had all the A&s;|&s;i&s;tance
underhand that the <HI>Queen Regent</HI> could
give them; but &s;he &s;till carried it fair to the
Reformers, and an&s;wered them mildly, lead|ing
them on in Hopes.</P>
<P>At la&s;t &s;he threw off the Mask, and openly
profe&s;t her Re&s;olution to de&s;troy them; that
&s;he would not &s;uffer the Maje&s;ty of the Govern|ment
to be deba&s;ed, but would re&s;tore it to
its ancient Veneration by &s;ome remarkable
Thing.</P>

<P>Upon this &s;he cited all the Mini&s;ters of <HI>Scot|land</HI>
to appear at <HI>Stirling,</HI> on the 10th of <HI>May</HI>
1559; but they came there with &s;uch Atten|dants,

the Regent out of her De&s;ign, and made her
entreat <HI>John Ereskine</HI> of <HI>Dun,</HI> a Lover of the
Religion, and that could influence them by him|&s;elf,
that he would di&s;per&s;e the People, giving
her Promi&s;e at the &s;ame Time to act Nothing
again&s;t the Reformers.&mdash;But &s;ee the Faith kept
at that Time with Prote&s;tants: As &s;oon as on
tho&s;e Promi&s;es the hone&s;t Men were returned
home, &s;he held the Meeting intended, called over
the Names, and outlawed tho&s;e that were ab|&s;ent

<P>The Nobility and Gentry a&s;&s;embled with the
Mini&s;ters, finding in what Manner they were
to be u&s;ed, that the Queen was wholly beut
for their De&s;truction, and neither to be bound
by Promi&s;es, or any other Obligation, and that
their Ruin was ab&s;olutely determined, prepared
for Force, re&s;olving to defend them&s;elves.</P>
<P>And now began the Fury of the People to

Effect upon the People, that not only the common
People, but the Provo&s;t, Bailies, and Magi&s;trates
re&s;olved to remove all the Monuments of Idola|try
in that Place, and performed it accordingly;
the Bi&s;hop taking Sanctuary with the Queen,
who lay with her Army then at <HI>Faulkland,</HI> as
before. The Queen, tho' &s;he had no great Kind|ne&s;s
for the Bi&s;hop, yet $heard him upon this
Occa&s;ion with great Concern and Attention, and
re&s;olved immediately to advance with her Army
to St. <HI>Andrews,</HI> to puni&s;h the Offenders with

mounted and accoutred, and among them were
&s;ome of the mo&s;t eminent of the Nobility, &s;uch
as the Earl of <HI>Rothes,</HI> the Lord <HI>Ruthwen,</HI> the Earl
of <HI>Argyle,</HI> the Lord <HI>James Stuart,</HI> Earl of <HI>Glen|cairn,</HI>
and others.</P>
<P>The Queen's Army marched all Night to
&s;urprize them, but found they had Intelligence
of her March, were drawn up ready to of|fer
her Battle, and re&s;olved to give her a warm

Me&s;&s;engers again, who pre&s;&s;ed them to treat, to

her fall on with her <HI>French</HI> Cut-throats when
&s;he plea&s;ed, alledging, there was no Safety in
treating with her. However, at length they
con&s;ented to come to a Treaty on this Prelimi|nary

a <HI>French</HI> Lord. This A&s;&s;urance was, That in 8
Days, Me&s;&s;engers &s;hould be &s;ent by the Queen to
treat of a full Peace; but the Queen, who never
regarded her Engagements in &s;uch Ca&s;es, never
&s;ent any Body to treat as &s;he had promi&s;ed, nor,
it &s;eems, did &s;he intend it; but thought that upon
this Treaty &s;he &s;hould have an Opportunity to
convey her <HI>French</HI> Troops &s;afe out of <HI>Fife,</HI> and
perhaps bring the Lords, in Confidence of her
Treaty, to di&s;per&s;e their Men: The fir&s;t of the&s;e
&s;he gain'd, but not the la&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="34">
The Lords waited &s;ome Time, but finding
no Body come, they, as Rea&s;on good, concluded
the Treaty broken.&mdash;And from this Time for|ward
they depended no more upon the Faith
of Treaties, but upon their Arms: Many of the
principal Nobility came in to them every Day,
and in&s;tead of di&s;per&s;ing, they grew very &s;trong;
and fir&s;t they march'd to St. <HI>John&s;ton,</HI> to de|liver
it from the Oppre&s;&s;ion of the Garri&s;on
which the Queen Regent had placed there: The
Town was &s;urrendered after &s;ome Difficulty,
and the Bi&s;hop's Hou&s;e at <HI>Scone</HI> rifled and burnt,
his Servants unadvi&s;edly provoking the Multi|tude,
whom the Lords had prevailed with to let
it alone.</P>
<P>From hence, fearing the Queen &s;hould inter|cept
their advancing, which &s;he was about to
do, by marching her &s;elf to <HI>Sterling,</HI> and putting
a Garri&s;on into the Ca&s;tle, they re&s;olved to pre|vent
her, and marching all Night, they took
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Sterlings,</HI> and &s;topping there but
Three Days; in which the Churches were &s;tript
of their Popi&s;h Ornaments, and the Abbey of
<HI>Cambuskenneth</HI> demoli&s;hed, they marched on the
Fourth Day for <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>
<P>The Queen might, by this Time, have per|ceived,
if her Eyes had been open, that the
whole Nation was bent upon the Reformation,
and that there was no re&s;i&s;ting it; but God
had hardened her Heart, and &s;he would not
under&s;tand what was vi&s;ible to all the World;
for the People of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> hearing the Lords
of the <HI>Congregation</HI> were marching to them, did
all the Work to their Hands, and left no Rem|nant

Troops fled; they began to act in behalf of their
Country's Liberty, as well as in religious Mat|ters;
This even by the Accounts which all
the Hi&s;torians of that Time give of it, will
clear the fir&s;t Reformers from the Slander that
is &s;o diligently ca&s;t upon them of making a
<HI>tumultuary</HI> Reformation, or that it was only a
Rabble of the meaner Sort, who were for Plun|der,
<PB N="33" REF="36">
and who, to enrich them&s;elves with
Spoils of the Churches, ran into the Reforma|tion
meerly to ju&s;tifie their Robberies, and in|demnifie
the Depredations they had made up|on
the Church; for now they had not only
Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> at their Head, but a very great
Number of the Nobility and Gentry were
profe&s;t Managers of the Reformation, and the

meddles not with them. But the Mini&s;ters
Opinion I cannot omit.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;ters, who were called, were Two,
Mr. <HI>John Willock</HI> and Mr. <HI>John Knox,</HI> who&s;e O|pinions
are faithfully enough related by Mr.
<HI>Spot&s;wood,</HI> and agree with the Account in <HI>Knox</HI>'s
Hi&s;tory, and areas follows.</P>
<P><HI>Mr.</HI> Willock <HI>fir&s;t gave his Opinion,</HI> &startq;That,
albeit Magi&s;tracy be God's Ordinance, and
that they who bear Rule, have their Authority
from him, yet their Power is not &s;o largely ex|tended
but that the &s;ame is bounded and limit|ed
by God in his Word: And albeit God had
appointed Magi&s;trates his Lieutenants on Earth,
honouring them with his own Title, calling
them Gods; yet did he never &s;o e&s;tabli&s;h any,
but for ju&s;t Cau&s;es they might be deprived:
For even as Subjects, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> are commanded
to obey their Magi&s;trates; &s;o Magi&s;trates have
Directions given them for their Behaviour to|wards
tho&s;e they rule; and God, in his Word,
hath defined the Duty both of one and the
other. In depo&s;ing Princes, and tho&s;e that
have born Authority, God did not always u&s;e
his immediate Power, but &s;ometimes he u&s;ed
other Means, &s;uch as in his Wi&s;dom he thought
good; as by <HI>A&s;a,</HI> he removed <HI>Maacha,</HI> his own
Mother; by <HI>Jehu,</HI> he de&s;troyed <HI>Joram;</HI> and by
divers others he depo&s;ed from the Govern|ment
tho&s;e whom he had e&s;tabli&s;hed before
by his own Word. From which, <HI>he inferred,</HI>
That &s;ince the Queen Regent had denied her
chief Duty to the Subjects of the Realm, which
was to mini&s;ter Ju&s;tice indifferently, to pre|&s;erve
them from the Inva&s;ion of Strangers,
and to &s;uffer the Word of God to be freely
preached; &s;eeing al&s;o &s;he was a Maintainer of
<PB N="38" REF="41">
Super&s;tition, and de&s;pi&s;ed the Coun&s;el of the
Nobility, he did think, they might ju&s;tly deprive
her from all Regiment and Authority over
them.&endq;</P>
<P><HI>Mr.</HI> Knox <HI>coming to &s;peak after approved all
that his Brother had &s;aid, adding this more,</HI> &startq;That
the Iniquity of the Queen Regent ought, no
to withdraw their Hearts from the Obedi|ence
due to their Sovereign; nor did he wi&s;h
any &s;uch Sentence to be pronounced again&s;t
her, but that when &s;he &s;hould change her
Cour&s;e, and &s;ubmit her &s;elf to good Council,
there mould be Place left to her of Regre&s;s
to the &s;ame Honours from which, for ju&s;t
Cau&s;es, &s;he ought now to be deprived.&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Spot&s;wood</HI> is very angry<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Spotfwood,</HI> lib. 3 fo. 137 It had been a better and a wi&s;er Part in the&s;e Preachers, to have excu&s;ed them&s;elves from giving any Opinion in the&s;e Matters; for they might be &s;ure to have it ca&s;t in their Teeth, to the Scandal of their Profe&s;&s;ion&mdash;</NOTE> with the Mi|ni&s;ters

Means have been found to no purpo&s;e, <HI>which was

this good old Man wrote; I mean, in an Age
when the&s;e Nations lull'd a&s;leep by the wheed|ling
Arts of Tyranny, under the gay-painted

good Meaning in him, he mu&s;t have altered his
Opinion.</P>
<P>As to his fir&s;t Objection&mdash;which &s;trikes at the
Di&s;cretion of the Mini&s;ters only, and charges
their&punc; Prudentials, it may be briefly an&s;wered,
that their Ca&s;e differed: This was a Ca&s;e begun
in, and carried on for, the Matters of Religion:
The Nobility and the Mini&s;ters had all along
gone on Hand in Hand, aiding, a&s;&s;i&s;ting, and ad|vi&s;ing
one another, and it would have been ve|ry
unkind if the Mini&s;ters, in a Ca&s;e of Con&s;ci|ence
too, &s;hould have declined their Opinion
to tho&s;e Gentlemen who, at that Time, by their
In&s;tigation very much, <HI>at lea&s;t with their full
Concurrence,</HI> had ventured their Lives, Families,
and E&s;tates in the publick Affair of religious
Liberty; it had been abandoning their Friends,
and which is wor&s;e, their Cau&s;e too.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="43">
Nor was this all, but the Ca&s;e required it;
for if it was <HI>again&s;t their Opinions</HI> that Authority
might be re&s;i&s;ted in Ca&s;es of Inva&s;ion of Right,
<HI>what did they there?</HI> And if it <HI>was their Opini|on,</HI>
Silence had only &s;ignified that it was their
Judgment, but that they <HI>feared the chief Prie&s;ts,</HI>
John xii. 42. <HI>that is,</HI> were Cowards, and dur&s;t
not own their Principles.</P>
<P>Again, it was a general Convention of the
E&s;tates of <HI>Scotland,</HI> that on &s;uch an Emergen|cy,
demanded their Opinion and this was to
them the <HI>lawful Authority</HI> at that Time, and
they ought not to have di&s;obeyed them in any
lawful Thing, if they e&s;teem'd them a lawful
<HI>Authority.</HI></P>
<P>His Doctrine about depo&s;ing Rulers is on &s;o
many Occa&s;ions an&s;wered, both in Print, as al&s;o in
the Practice of Nations, that I &s;hall not take up
any of the&s;e Sheets in it. But this I thought ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to &s;ay in Defence of the Mini&s;tes of the
fir&s;t Reformation, I hope none of the Clergy
of the Church of <HI>England</HI> will blame them, &s;eeing
they owe now the Settlement and Deliverance
of their own Church from Popi&s;h Inva&s;ions to
the &s;ame depo&s;ing Doctrine at the Revoluti|on.</P>

after the Mini&s;ters had given their Opinion, u|nanimou&s;ly
voted the Regent out of her Office,
renounced their Obedience to her, and bid her
and her <HI>Frenchmen</HI> depart.</P>

&s;o the&s;e being &s;ome of the mo&s;t capital
Parts of her Progre&s;&s;ion to the pre&s;ent happy
Settlement which we &s;ee her now in, it is
e&s;&s;ential to my Work to leave this Part as clear
and explicit as I can.</P>
<P>And it may be particularly plea&s;ant to the
Friends of her E&s;tabli&s;hment, to ob&s;erve how
wonderfully divine Providence has wrought for
her, not barely in re&s;cuing her by Violence out
of the Jaws of Super&s;tition, and its Handmaid
Tyranny; but the &s;ame Providence has given a
Sanction to the very Method, by obliging tho&s;e
very People, who upbraid her with the Man|ner
of her E&s;tabli&s;hment, as being popular and
tumultuary, and built on the Foundation of Re|bellion,
again&s;t lawful Authority, to be behold|ing
<PB N="42" REF="45">

they now are built upon.</P>
<P>Nor is there any Ca&s;e that I meet with &s;o
parallel to the late Revolution in <HI>England</HI> as
this Revolution in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and yet we are not
of the Opinion that the Revolution in <HI>England</HI>
was tumultuary at all.</P>
<P>They both began, and both were carried on
by the &s;ame Methods, and no other, by which
Nations oppre&s;&s;ed, have, in all Ages, recover|ed
their Liberty, and &s;natched them&s;elves out
of the Jaws of Tyranny and Oppre&s;&s;ion: Ways
honourable, and ju&s;tifiable by the Laws of God,
of Nature, and of Nations.</P>
<P>I &s;hall keep my Word, as to Brevity, in the
following Part of the Story.&mdash;The Nobility
having thus renounced the Regent, they &s;ent to
&s;ummon the Town of <HI>Leith;</HI> but the <HI>French</HI>
had made it too &s;trong to part with it &s;o ea&s;ily.</P>
<P>They were indeed formidable to the Con|gregation;
for they had the Command of the
Sea, and being at lea&s;t 8000 Men well officer'd
and di&s;ciplin'd, they tran&s;ported them&s;elves o|ver
into <HI>Fife,</HI> and ravaged the Country from
<HI>Sterling</HI> Bridge to St. <HI>Andrews.</HI></P>
<P>The Congregation had no proportioned Forces
for this Work, nor wherewith to &s;upply them:
They &s;ent to <HI>England</HI> and borrow'd 4000 Crowns
for pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion; but the Queen, who had
her Spies upon them, got Intelligence of it, and
&s;urpriz'd both the Man and the Money.</P>
<P>Their Affairs thus running backward, they
came to the la&s;t and only Expedient, which was
to put them&s;elves under the Protection of the
Queen of <HI>England,</HI> and &s;eek A&s;&s;i&s;tance.&mdash;And
here it is to be noted, that the Presbyterians did
not fly to Foreign Help to invade their Sove|reign,
<PB N="43" REF="46">
as &s;ome will have it to be; the E&s;tabli&s;hing
the Reformation did not &s;eek Foreign Help; for
the Nation having &s;o univer&s;ally embrac'd the
Prote&s;tant Religion, there was not one in Ten
to &s;tand again&s;t them.</P>
<P>But the Ca&s;e turned ju&s;t the other Way: The
Lords of the Congregation had, as has been re|lated,
engaged in the Reformation; the Queen
Regent had, by &s;everal Treaties, a&s;&s;ented to it,
Part, at one Time, Part at another, but keep|ing
no Faith with them, and re&s;olving, if po&s;|&s;ible,
to root them out&mdash;&s;he <HI>flies to Foreign Aid:</HI>
Mark it; &s;he brings in an Army of Strangers,
takes Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their Towns, and fortifies'em,
in Order to &s;upport her in the tyrannical Mea|&s;ures
&s;he had taken.</P>
<P>To root out this Mi&s;chief the War began, and
not meerly for Religion; had the Nation been
clear'd of Foreigners, on either Side, the Work
had &s;oon been done; but being invaded by
<HI>France,</HI> they flew to <HI>England</HI> for Help, and
&s;oon obtained it.</P>

call it,</HI> and ha&s;tened the Surrender of <HI>Leith,</HI>
which held out but a little while; not but that
it might have held longer, and no doubt it
would, the Garri&s;on being re&s;olute, well pro|vided,
and Relief expected; but the Queen of
<HI>England</HI> and the King of <HI>France</HI> having brought
Matters to a Treaty abroad, a Treaty at home
followed of cour&s;e; &s;o Amba&s;&s;adors, from either,
met at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and a Truce being at fir&s;t a|greed
on, the Capitulation and general Peace
followed; and the <HI>16th</HI> of <HI>July</HI> 1560, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Army marched for <HI>Barwick,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> &s;et &s;ail
for <HI>France,</HI> and a general Peace was made; in
which, among other Articles, this glorious Sti|pulation
was one, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>the REFORMA|TION
WAS ACKNOWLEDG'D,</HI> and con|&s;idering
the Infancy of the Church, and the
Difficulties her fir&s;t Champions had waded
through, it was a very great Step to her fu|ture
E&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>The Death of the Queen Mother was follow|ed
by another Event, which had no le&s;s In|fluence
upon the Affairs of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and this
<PB N="45" REF="48">
was, That the Queen became a Widow, <HI>Fran|cis</HI>
II, the King of <HI>France,</HI> dying the &s;ame Year,
a few Months after his Mother-in-Law.</P>
<P>This gave a new Turn to the Affairs of <HI>Scot|land,</HI>
and the Popi&s;h Party was, and not with|out
Cau&s;e, exceedingly &s;urprized at it; for they
had before, the whole Kingdom of <HI>France</HI> con|cern'd
to &s;upport them; and their Queen being
then married to the King of <HI>France</HI> they had
them jointly concerned in the Affairs; whereas
now, another King &s;ucceeding to the Crown of
<HI>France,</HI> their Queen became but a Dowager, an
Allie, and her Intere&s;t and Power would be the
le&s;s to &s;upport her Friends in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>The Congregation had now the Government
of the whole Kingdom in their Hands, and the
Queen was, as we may &s;ay, at their Mercy:
And this was a &s;pecial Providence to them, as
for &s;ettling the Reformation, &s;o to clear up the
Reputation of the Reformers, and purge them
from the Charge the late Queen Regent had laid
upon them, of aiming at the Subver&s;ion of the
Government, and dethroning their Sovereign,
to &s;et up either Lord <HI>James,</HI> or the Duke of
<HI>Chattellerault</HI> in her Place.</P>
<P>But this &s;till tended to their Reputation, and
to exonerate them as to the Charge for when
the Regent was dead, the Queen a de&s;olate Wi|dow,
and they had all the power in their Hands,
their upright De&s;ign could never better appear;
for they had no one to hinder their Project,
if they had had it in their View; but being
&s;incerely bent for the Reformation of Religion,
and the E&s;tabli&s;hment of their Civil Liberties,
and aiming at nothing el&s;e, they applyed them|&s;elves
wholly to that Work, and no other, as
will appear in the Pur&s;uit of this Story.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="49">
In order to this, having di&s;mi&s;s'd the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>

<HI>With this &s;mall Number of Bi&s;hops</HI> (he would have called
them) <HI>was the Plantation of the Church at fir&s;t undertaken.,</HI> for I mu&s;t
be particular here as to Authors, they di&s;tribu|ted
Mini&s;ters among the Burghs, and appoint|ed
Superintendents for the Direction of the
Church Affairs.</P>
<P>I note this the rather here, becau&s;e &s;ome.
Gentlemen, who are angry with the Church of
<HI>Scotland</HI> for the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment, would
call this Superintendency an Infant Prelacy; and
from thence argue, that the fir&s;t Reformation
was Epi&s;copal, which Difficulty we &s;hall &s;ee
clear'd up as we go on.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, it will receive its full An&s;wer
in the&s;e Two Ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>1. They had no Power: What they were to do, or
what Power they had for the planting or di&s;placing
Mini&s;ters in the Kingdom, had the&s;e two Things
<PB N="47" REF="50">
<HI>attending it, which quite enervates the Bi&s;hop's Al|legation,</HI>
viz.</P>
<P>(1.) That it was all &s;ub&s;ervient to the A&s;&s;embly
of Mini&s;ters; nay, the&s;e <HI>Superintendents</HI> were &s;ub|jected
to the re&s;pective Presbyteries: They might be
di&s;plac'd by them, <HI>and</HI> &s;upply'd by them; <HI>and</HI> the
A&s;&s;embly does <HI>&s;till,</HI> on extraordinary Occa&s;ions, depute
or commi&s;&s;ion Mini&s;ters, <HI>in like manner,</HI> for the
planting or di&s;placing their Mini&s;ters, vi&s;iting of
Churches, and the like.</P>
<P>(2.) They had neither Superiority of <HI>Dignity,</HI> or
Enlargement of <HI>Stipend,</HI> or any other Thing
which might invade that PARITY which is
orofe&s;s'd by the Presbyterian Church.</P>
<P>2. The Ca&s;e was extraordinary, and it is what
is never practi&s;ed in the Church but on extraordi|nary
Occa&s;ions, of which this is allowed to be one;
and there is no Que&s;tion but on the like extraordina|ry
Occa&s;ions, the like Offices would be made u&s;e of
again, which, in &s;hort, were only Delegations, or Sub&s;ti|tutions
by and from the General A&s;&s;embly: The Men
had neither per&s;onal Dignity, nor per&s;onal Power;
their Commi&s;&s;ion was temporary, and the Limitation
of their Authority was &s;uch, as whenever the Bi&s;hops
of the Church of <HI>England</HI> plea&s;e to reduce them|&s;elves
to, there is no Presbyterian Church in the
World but would receive them.</P>
<P>The Debate therefore of this &s;uppo&s;ed Epi&s;copacy
mu&s;t fall to the Ground, unle&s;s the Gentlemen that
are for it, are content to &s;ubject Epi&s;copacy to
Presbytery; for the A&s;&s;embly of Mini&s;ters, either
General, Synodical, or Presbyterial had a Power
over tho&s;e Superintendents, and the Remark would be
very well worth Note what a Kind of a Bi&s;hop it
is the&s;e Gentlemen plead for.</P>
<P>The Superintendents were, in &s;hort, a temporary
Expedient for the Nece&s;&s;ity of the fir&s;t planting the
<PB N="48" REF="51">
Church, and the Mini&s;ters, who appointed them,
were the mo&s;t antiepi&s;copal in Principle that could
be found, as we &s;hall &s;ee pre&s;ently. <HI>But I return to
the Story.</HI></P>
<P>The Lords having thus &s;ettled the Church's
Affairs for the pre&s;ent, all Things re&s;ted till
the Meeting of a Convention, or Parliament,
which was appointed to be in <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> following.</P>
<P>Here another Di&s;pute happened, which the
Popi&s;h Party have &s;till in&s;i&s;ted on, <HI>viz. How
this could be called a Parliament, &s;ince it was not
called by the Queen,</HI> neither <HI>had her Maje&s;ty any
Body there commi&s;&s;ioned to repre&s;ent her Per&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>But the Treaty of Peace &s;olv'd this; which
being &s;tipulated in the Name and by the Am|ba&s;&s;ador
of the King and Queen, authori&s;ed the
Council of Twelve, to call a Convention or
Parliament, and this fully legitimated it, tho'
there was no Per&s;on to repre&s;ent the Sovereign.</P>
<P>In this Parliament all that had been done be|fore
was ratified; and having a &s;ufficient War|rant,
as before, for the holding this Parliament,
they e&s;teemed what Acts pa&s;s'd, Authentick,
tho' the Queen afterwards refu&s;ed to ratifie
them, <HI>as we &s;hall hear pre&s;ently.</HI></P>
<P>Four Acts pa&s;s'd in this Parliament, tho' they
had not the Royal A&s;&s;ent till &s;everal Years af|terward.</P>
<P>1. The Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith. Note, it pa&s;s'd
in Parliament <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 17, 1560.</P>
<P>2. An Act for aboli&s;hing the Juri&s;diction and
Authority of the Bi&s;hops.</P>
<P>3. Repealing, or annulling all former Acts
made for the maintaining of Idolatry.</P>
<P>4. For puni&s;hing the Sayers and Hearers of
Ma&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="52">
A Me&s;&s;enger was &s;ent over to the Queen with
the&s;e Acts, to de&s;ire her Maje&s;ty to &s;ign them;
but the Queen would not &s;o much as give an
An&s;wer to him, but treated him with the ut|mo&s;t
Contempt. However, the Acts being pa&s;t,
the A&s;&s;embly was di&s;&s;olved, and this was the
fir&s;t Settlement of the Reformation.</P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erved here, that the Articles of
the Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith, contain all the <HI>doctrinal
Part</HI> of the Reformer's profe&s;&s;ion; but have
not one Word of the <HI>Di&s;cipline</HI> or <HI>Government</HI>
of the Church; nor was the Form of Wor&s;hip
&s;ettled here: And to this it is needful to &s;ay
&s;omething; becau&s;e great Pains are taken here
to make the fir&s;t Reformation look as if it had
been <HI>Epi&s;copal.</HI></P>
<P>That they had a Form of Di&s;cipline and
Wor&s;hip before this, is<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>Calderwood</HI>'s Hi&s;tory, fol. 14. Before the Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith was formed, and the Book of Di&s;cipline contrived, the re|formed Kirk had that Book which is before the P&s;alms in Meeter for their Direction in Di&s;cipline and external Wor&s;hip; which Book is called in the Book of Di&s;eipline, the Book of Common Order, or the Order of the Church at <HI>Geneva.</HI></NOTE> allowed by all Hi|&s;torians,
which was the Order of <HI>Geneva;</HI> the new

<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary to digre&s;s a little here to the
Story of Mr. <HI>John Knox.</HI> He had been long
at <HI>Geneva,</HI> and was Mini&s;ter of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Church
there: He had al&s;o been at <HI>Frankfort,</HI> where the
<HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who fled from Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s Per&s;ecu|tion,
had a Church, and Mr. <HI>Knox</HI> preaching
there, a Difference aro&s;e about the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ser|vice-Book,
which drove him back to <HI>Geneva.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="53">
Here he drew the Model of Church Govern|ment,
which he after pre&s;ented to the Refor|mers
in <HI>Scotland</HI> for the Scheme of theirs; and
by this was that Book of Polity or Di&s;cipline
formed which we are now to treat of. Some
Hi&s;torians have called it <HI>John Knox</HI>'s Work:
Others &s;ay, it was done by a<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><HI>Commi&s;&s;ion was given to Mr.</HI> John Winram, John Spot&s;|wood, <HI>the Bi&s;hop's Father,</HI> John Willock, John Douglas, John Rew, <HI>and</HI> John Knox, <HI>to draw up a Book of Policy and Di&s;cipline of the Church, as they had done of the Doctrine.</HI></NOTE> Committee.</P>
<P>They that would call it <HI>John Knox</HI>'s, &s;trive to
do it becau&s;e the Article of Superintendents
being mentioned in this Book of Di&s;cipline, they
would have <HI>John Knox</HI> be acknowledged to be
of Epi&s;copal Principles.</P>
<P>But I conceive, that all this Di&s;pute about
the Superintendents would be at an End, if it
were examined, whether the&s;e Superintendents
were not really Bi&s;hops? And whether the true
Epi&s;copacy is not plainly to be reduced to the
mini&s;terial Function? So that this is &s;o far from
ju&s;tifying the Authority, Dignity, and Superi|ority
of Bi&s;hops, as now practi&s;ed, that it ra|ther
brings down the Bi&s;hop, to the Station of
tho&s;e Superintendents, the utmo&s;t of who&s;e Au|thority
is by Dr. <HI>Rule</HI> plainly proved to be ve|ry
con&s;i&s;tent with <HI>Presbyterian Parity,</HI> a Thing
which, if well<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, <HI>lib.</HI> III. <HI>fol. 174. It had been fram'd by</HI> John Knox, <HI>partly in Imitation of the reformed Churches in</HI> Germany, <HI>and partly of that he had &s;een at</HI> Geneva.</NOTE> con&s;idered, would &s;oon put
an End to this Debate.</P>
<P>This Book of Di&s;cipline, however, could not
obtain, with the Lords, to a general A&s;&s;ent, whe|ther
Mr. <HI>Knox</HI> formed it or not; 'tis plain he
<PB N="51" REF="54">
exceedingly pre&s;s'd to have it pa&s;s'd in the Con|vention.
Bi&s;hop <HI>Spot&s;wood</HI> &s;ays, the E&s;tates at
that Time did not think it meet to enter into
the Examination of the <HI>Polity.</HI> By this he
would in&s;inuate, that the Reformation was &s;et|tled
in general, as to Doctrine, and that all a|greed
in the Suppre&s;&s;ion of Popery; but that
the Manner, Order, Polity, or Di&s;cipline of the
Church was left uncertain and undetermined.
But neither will this an&s;wer: For tho' as an A&s;|&s;embly
or Convention they did not &s;ign it, yet
as private Men, the whole Body of the fir&s;t Re|formers,
who had been called <HI>The Congregation,</HI>
and who had done all the Work, <HI>&s;igned it</HI>&mdash;
The&s;e were the Duke of <HI>Chatellerault,</HI> the Earls of
<HI>Arran, Argyle, Glencairn, Mar&s;hall, Monteith,
Morton,</HI> and <HI>Rothes;</HI> Lords, James <HI>Hamilton, Ye|&s;ter,
Boyd, Ochiltrie, Sanquhar, Lind&s;ay:</HI> And A|bundance
of the Gentry, Barons, and Burge&s;&s;es,
with one Bi&s;hop, <HI>viz.</HI> of <HI>Galloway,</HI> and the Dean
of <HI>Murray.</HI></P>
<P>But to go on with our Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Thus far the Convention had acted in behalf
of the Church: (1.) They pull'd down, and by
an Act, aboli&s;hed Popery for ever. (2.) They
declared the Confe&s;&s;ion of the Prote&s;tant Faith,
and pa&s;s'd the Articles of it into an Act: And
thus they &s;et the Church upon her own Legs,
and then left her to &s;ettle and fix her &s;elf upon
&s;uch Foundations of Di&s;cipline and Government
as &s;he &s;hould determine.</P>
<P>In order to this, the fir&s;t General A&s;&s;embly
of the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;at down at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI>
the <HI>20th</HI> of <HI>December,</HI> 1560.</P>
<P>Their chief Work was appointing and re|ceiving
Mini&s;ters, and that alone determined, that
the very Office of Superintendent was &s;ubjected
<PB N="52" REF="55">
to the A&s;&s;embly; but if that did not, we &s;hall
&s;ee in a few Years they take upon them to li|mit,
approve, and di&s;approve their Actions.</P>
<P>Even in this fir&s;t A&s;&s;embly, the other Party
made &s;ome Struggle about the Authority of a&s;|&s;embling
without the Queen's Command, and
as this has been a Point frequently pu&s;h'd at
&s;ince, and once not very long ago, and may, in
Time, come to be pu&s;h'd at again, it cannot be
ami&s;s to &s;et down the Argument then u&s;ed,
which, in &s;hort, was this principally.</P>
<P>They had then a Popi&s;h Queen, who, unwilling|ly,
&s;toop'd to Nece&s;&s;ity in the Reformation, their
Words are the&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> if the Liberty of the Kirk &s;hould
depend upon the Allowance and Di&s;allowance of the
Sovereign, <HI>we may be deprived, not only of</HI> A&s;&s;em|blies,
<HI>but of the publick Preaching of the Go&s;pel. Take
from the Church the Freedom of A&s;&s;emblies, and
you take from us the Reformation; for how &s;hall
the Government of the Church be &s;upported, Order
and Unity in Doctrine be maintained, but by the
Liberty of holding</HI> A&s;&s;emblies, <HI>and keeping up the
judicial Authority of the Church entire.</HI> This
way of Arguing was never yet an&s;wered, and,
I pre&s;ume, will not ea&s;ily be an&s;wered.</P>
<P>It was then moved, in the A&s;&s;embly, that the
Queen might be de&s;ired to ratifie the Book of
Di&s;cipline, but it was deferred for that Time.</P>
<P>The Queen was now returned to <HI>Scotland, an.</HI>
1561, and began to take Cognizance of her
Affairs, in which &s;he very early di&s;covered her
Di&s;like of what was doing, and her general
Aver&s;ion to the Reformation.</P>
<P>It &s;eem'd, however, that the Queen, enclined
to &s;toop to the Nece&s;&s;ity of the Times, and to ac|quie&s;ce
in the new Church Settlement, with al|lowing
her the Liberty of her own Opinion,
<PB N="53" REF="56">
and to have Ma&s;s &s;aid in private in her own
Chappel&mdash;but this gave great Offence, and the
Mini&s;ters particularly in&s;i&s;ted upon it, that it
was again&s;t their Engagements for the aboli&s;h|ing
Idolatry, and, inculcating this on the Peo|ple,
the Queen found &s;he lo&s;t very much of
their Affection by it, and not only &s;o, but met
with &s;ome Affronts in it al&s;o. However, re|&s;olved
to &s;upport, not only her Authority, but
her Party, &s;he proceeded warmly.</P>
<P>She put the Provo&s;t of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> into the Ca|&s;tle,
and obliged the Citizens to choo&s;e another.
This was done for their forbidding the Popi&s;h
Prie&s;ts to be received into the Town. She then
commanded the Town-Council of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> to
choo&s;e a new Provo&s;t, which they, for Fear,
at that Time complied with. Next by Procla|mation,
&s;he made the City of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> free, as
&s;he term'd it, for all her Subjects to repair to on
their lawful Occa&s;ions. This re&s;tor'd the Papi&s;ts:
And here &s;he not only had the better of the City,
but really &s;eemed to have &s;ome Right on her
Side, and therefore the Lords did not &s;tand by
the Citizens in it as was expected.</P>
<P>Indeed the Court being now formed, and the
Queen acting with great Candour in other
Things, the Nobility began to be drawn in by
Offices, Sallaries, and Preferments; together
with the Emulation and Ambition, u&s;ual in &s;uch
Ca&s;es; &s;o that the Lords, who were before, the
mo&s;t zealous for the Reformation, tho' they re|tained
their &s;incere Profe&s;&s;ion of the Prote&s;tant
Religion, yet they remitted much of their for|mer
Zeal, and &s;eemed to be drawn off from
their Strictne&s;s in the Pro&s;ecution of, and their
warm Application to the great Work of all. And
<PB N="54" REF="57">
this our Hi&s;torians, of both Parties<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, <HI>lib. 4. fol.</HI> 183. Some of the Noblemen who had, in former Times, &s;hewed them&s;elves mo&s;t zealous again&s;t the Toleration of Idolatry, were grown a little more cold by the Flat|teries of the Court; and all of them emulous of each other's Greatne&s;s, were &s;triving who &s;hould be in mo&s;t Favour with the Queen.</NOTE>,<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Calderwood, <HI>Hi&s;t. fol. 34.

<P>The Match was now fix'd, and the Queen
married to the Lord <HI>Darnley,</HI> in <HI>July</HI> 1564, di&s;|regarding
the Repre&s;entation of the di&s;content|ed

followed, one on the Neck of another, almo&s;t
to the Ruin of the Nation, and effectually to
the Ruin of the King, and in the End, of the
Queen al&s;o.</P>
<P>The Queen re&s;olved to ruin the Lords, who
were fled, called a Parliament, to forefault or
attaint them: In this Parliament, &s;ay<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, <HI>lib. 4. fol. 195. The Queen de&s;igning he &s;hould act as Chanceller in this Parliament,</HI> Morton <HI>who, after</HI> Hunt|ley's Death, had &s;upplied that Place, took it as an Affr$nt to him.</NOTE> &s;ome,
&s;he de&s;igned to make <HI>Rizzio</HI> Chancellor, and
<PB N="59" REF="62">
this occa&s;ioned <HI>Morton</HI>'s falling upon him. O|thers
&s;ay, he had plotted the De&s;truction of the
Nobility, and had propo&s;ed to the Queen the
cutting them off by way of Ma&s;&s;acre. Again,
he is charged with a &s;candalous Familiarity
with the Queen, which, whether it were true,
or that it was &s;ugge&s;ted to the King to irri|tate
him, and bring him to be concerned in the
Fact, is not material farther than this; that by
it, the Enmity between the Queen and him,
which was before begun, was made &s;o irrecon|cileable,
that as <HI>he never re&s;ted</HI> till he had cau&s;ed
the <HI>Italian</HI> to be murthered, <HI>the Queen never re|&s;ted</HI>
till &s;he had cau&s;ed her Husband to be mur|thered,
and divine Ju&s;tice, after all, <HI>never re&s;t|ed</HI>
till it had cau&s;ed her to be murthered; &s;o
that Blood followed Blood till that whole Knot
was de&s;troyed. And thus the Enemies of the
Reformation made Way, by their own De&s;tru|ction,
for the more legal and more peaceable
compleating of this great Work of the Refor|mation,
to the Glory of God, and the Honour
of true Religion, as &s;hall pre&s;ently appear.</P>
<P>The Murther of this ob&s;cure Fellow however
had this Influence, that upon this Pro&s;pect of
the Lords of the Court engaging with the King
again&s;t <HI>David Rizzio,</HI> the bani&s;hed Lords took
Courage to come home, and the Parliament be|ing
&s;itting, offered them&s;elves to Tryal, and no
Body appearing again&s;t them, the Lords being
all bandyed into Parties on the other Occa&s;ion,
they were acquitted; again the Queen terrified
with the Strength of her Husband's Party, and
the Re&s;olution which they appeared to have
taken, fac'd about to the Lords that had fled,
received them into Favour, and bent her Fury
at the Murtherers of her Favourite.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="63">
In this Juncture &s;he was brought to Bed of a Son,
who was afterwards King <HI>James</HI> VI, who was
born in <HI>Edinburgh</HI> Ca&s;tle on the <HI>19th</HI> of <HI>June,</HI>
in a little Room facing the Ca&s;tle-Hill, which
is &s;till remembred as the Birth-Place of that
King. 'Tis reported &s;he was &s;o irritated at the
King for the Murther of <HI>Rizzio,</HI> that &s;he had
determined to de&s;troy the Child, as not bear|ing
to nouri&s;h any Thing of his begetting. I
do not &s;ay this was any more than a Report;
but it gives us a Hint of the Spirit that then
reigned, and &s;he having, as there is Rea&s;on to
believe, at the &s;ame Time re&s;olved to murther
the Father, it might not be improbable &s;he had
as barbarous Thoughts towards the Child. But
God had other De&s;igns to bring to pa&s;s in this
Birth, whether for the Good or Ill of the Church
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Con&s;equence will make appear.</P>
<P>Another Note is made here upon this Prince,
how ju&s;tly I will not determine, <HI>viz.</HI> That the
Fright and Terror his Mother was in, at the
drawn Swords which were in the Hands of the
Per&s;ons employed in this Attempt, (for <HI>Rizzio</HI>
was fallen upon in her Pre&s;ence) &s;o far influenc'd
the Child in her Womb, that his Retentives
generally fail'd him at the Sight of Weapons
ever after.&mdash;<HI>But this by the Way.</HI> 'Tis no Scan|dal
to &s;ay of him, he was no Man of War.</P>
<P>The A&s;&s;embly being then &s;itting, they &s;ent
&s;ome of their Number to congratulate the Queen
on the Birth of a Son, and humbly to de&s;ire
the Prince might be baptized into the Prote&s;tant
Church: The Queen gave no An&s;wer to it at
that Time, but very effectually made a Reply to
it afterwards, cau&s;ing him to be baptized after
the Popi&s;h Manner, at <HI>Sterling</HI> Ca&s;tle, by the
Archbi&s;hop of St. <HI>Andrews.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="64">
The Church now began to &s;ee which Way
Things were going; for the Queen not only
honoured the Archbi&s;hop of St. <HI>Andrews</HI> with
the baptizing the Prince, but gave him al&s;o a
Commi&s;&s;ion, whereby he was re&s;tored to his
ancient Juri&s;diction in &s;everal Things, which
cla&s;h'd with their Authority; &s;uch as confirming
Te&s;taments, Collation to Benefices, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> both
which being directly contrary to the Acts of
Parliament, which e&s;tabli&s;hed the <HI>Reformation,</HI>
and to the true Intere&s;t of the Prote&s;tant Set|tlement,
the A&s;&s;embly was exceedingly alarm'd
at it; but finding it in vain to addre&s;s the Queen
any more, they formed a Paper in manner of
an Appeal; but called it a Supplication, dire|cted,
<HI>as appears in the Title,</HI> to the Nobility and
Lords of the &s;ecret Council, who had profe&s;s'd
Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and who had renounced the <HI>Ro|man</HI>
Antichri&s;t: The&s;e Proceedings on both
Sides, ripened Things for the &s;udden Change
which &s;oon after followed.</P>
<P>The Murther of the King was the next Tra|gedy
that came on the Stage of this unhappy
Court: The Queen, after her being delivered of
a Son, and, if &s;he had the wicked De&s;ign of
murthering it, being prevented the Execution
of that Murther, retired to <HI>Alloway,</HI> a Hou&s;e of

her, but was refu&s;ed Admittance, (&s;he
re&s;olving to have no more of his Race, as &s;he
openly declared) and was treated with great Con|tempt.&mdash;Upon
this the King, (&s;ay &s;ome, with

whether <HI>Bothwell</HI> formed his De&s;truction upon
an Apprehen&s;ion of the Queen's being reconci|led
to him at that Time, <HI>is uncertain</HI> to this Hour;
but &s;he went to vi&s;it him, and after &s;ome Words
they were openly reconciled again, and the
King was, at the Queen's Appointment, carried
to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> where he had not been many Days
but he was mo&s;t barbarou&s;ly murthered in his
Bed, and the Hou&s;e blown up with Gunpowder,
as by the Hi&s;tories of tho&s;e Times more large|ly
is to be &s;een.</P>

All agree that it was vilely contrived be|tween
the Queen and <HI>Bothwell,</HI> and more vilely
executed by <HI>Bothwell,</HI> either in Per&s;on or by his

<P>But I am, by the Cour&s;e of Things, ha&s;ten|ing
to the great Revolution which now hap|pened,
and which all the&s;e horrid Things were
but as &s;o many preparatory Steps to bring to
pa&s;s.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, the abominable Marriage between <HI>Both|well</HI>
and the Queen, which was brought to pa&s;s
&s;oon after, which made the Matter &s;o black that
nothing could be wor&s;e, next to owning the
<PB N="63" REF="66">
Fact, <HI>viz.</HI> That a Woman &s;hould link her &s;elf
in Marriage to the Murtherer of her Husband.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Her Behaviour at the Parliament
which then approach'd, where &s;he positively
refu&s;ed all that was de&s;ired of her in behalf of
he Reformation, and behaved with a quite dif|erent
Air from all &s;he had done formerly.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Manife&s;t De&s;igns and &s;ecret Attempts
of the Queen to get the Cu&s;tody of her Son
out of the Hands of the Lord <HI>Mar,</HI> who claim'd
it by Birth as hereditary Keeper of the King's
Children.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Step to what followed was by the
Earl of <HI>Athol,</HI> who, fully &s;atisfied of the Guilt
of <HI>Bothwell</HI> in the Murther of the King, and
meditating how he might with mo&s;t Ea&s;e bring
him to Ju&s;tice, begins to &s;tart among the No|bility
his ju&s;t Su&s;picions, that the &s;ame Villainy
might be practi&s;ed upon the Infant as had been
upon the Father.</P>
<P>Upon this the Prote&s;tant Lords appoint a
Meeting at <HI>Sterling,</HI> in order to protect and
&s;ecure the Per&s;on of the <HI>Prince:</HI> And in this
Meeting the De&s;truction of Popery, Trea&s;on,
and Murther took its Ri&s;e: They all met with
their Fate together, and this abominable Gene&s;ration,
with their &s;hort liv'd Joy, vani&s;hed in
Stink and Smoak, being grown noy&s;ome to the
whole World by the mo&s;t horrid Actions that
were ever read of.</P>
<P>The Queen, hearing of this Meeting, and
that the Lords had entered into Bond, one to
another, for mutual A&s;&s;i&s;tance, pretends a Jour|ney,
to vi&s;it the Borders, and thereby, accord|ing
to Cu&s;tom, &s;ummons the Subjects to attend
her with Arms and Provi&s;ions for 15 Days:
Upon this, a Rumour being &s;pread that the
<PB N="64" REF="67">
Queen de&s;igned to &s;eize on the young Prince,
and take him from the Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> the Lords
afore&s;aid take Arms, the Queen publi&s;hes a De|claration
that &s;he does not de&s;ign to remove the
Prince; but this not &s;atisfying the Lords, they
&s;urround her in <HI>Brothwick</HI> Ca&s;tle, but not being
able entirely to inve&s;t the Place, <HI>Bothwell</HI> and
the Queen make their E&s;cape to <HI>Dunbar,</HI> and
then, tho' too late, &s;he rai&s;es Forces.</P>
<P>The Lords advanc'd to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and the
Queen to <HI>Mu&s;&s;celburgh,</HI> but when the Armies fa|ced
one another, the Queen's Men did not care to
fight, <HI>Bothwell</HI>'s Guilt was too great, his Heart
fail'd him, and he ran away: The Queen, who
had both more Courage and more Pre&s;ence of
Mind, &s;taid, but was obliged to put her &s;elf
into the Hands of the Lords, who carried her
to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and from thence, &s;hewing her in|deed
but very little Re&s;pect, &s;ent her Pri&s;oner
to the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Loch-Leven.</HI> Thus ended the
Reign of Popery in <HI>Scotland,</HI> I mean barefac'd
profe&s;s'd, down right Popery; as for Popery
in Ma&s;querade, eventual Popery, di&s;gui&s;ed Po|pery,

And yet after all this Aver&s;ion manife&s;ted

<P>In the mean Time the Nobility con&s;idered of
&s;ettling the Government, and of entirely depo&s;ing
the Queen: The fir&s;t Step to this was, by pro|curing
her to demit or re&s;ign the Crown: &s;he
at fir&s;t re&s;olutely oppo&s;ed it, but afterwards
&s;ign'd<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, <HI>lib. 4. fol. 211.

&s;he did now could be binding upon her
for the future.</P>
<P>Thus &s;he &s;igned &s;everal In&s;truments, one for
the Surrender of the Crown, renouncing and
demitting the Government in Favour of her
Son, commi&s;&s;ioning the Lords for his &s;olemn In|ve&s;titure:
One other was a Power to &s;ome No|blemen
to make the &s;olemn Re&s;ignation, in her

One other was for nominating the Earl of
<HI>Murray,</HI> who was then in <HI>France,</HI> Regent of the

other for naming Governours to her Son. But
afterwards when &s;he made her E&s;cape out of

took her at her fir&s;t Word, and in the mean

&s;he fled into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>There &s;he pa&s;t a long Impri&s;onment, by Order
of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> during which for carrying
ou innumerable Plots and Contrivances again&s;t
the &s;aid Queen and her Subjects, &s;he was at la&s;t
brought to the Block, on Pretence of con|&s;piring
again&s;t the <HI>English.</HI>&mdash;Whether their
Pretence again&s;t her was ju&s;t or no, I do not
determine; but that Ju&s;tice pur&s;ued her, as is
&s;aid before, for the mo&s;t abominable Fact a|bove,
I mean the Murther of her Husband, I
think is plain from all Hi&s;tories of tho&s;e Times.</P>
<P>The Realm was now under the Conduct of
the <HI>Regent,</HI> the King an Infant, and they had
brought the Queen to make a Kind of A&s;&s;ent
to the crowning her Son, and to appoint him
<PB N="69" REF="72">
Governours. The Regent managed with a Pru|dence
not to be de&s;cribed; in Diligence unwea|ried,
in Action undaunted, in Government &s;a|gacious,
in Religion zealous, and exceeding pi|ous,
in Life &s;edate, and in his violent Death
patient and re&s;igned.&mdash;He was barbarou&s;ly mur|thered
by <HI>James Hamilton,</HI> &s;et to work by the
Queen's Party: He &s;hot him through the Body
in the Street at <HI>Lithgo,</HI> as he was riding out of
the Pallace amid&s;t a great Throng of the People
crouding to &s;ee him: The Murtherer made his
E&s;cape out of a Back-Door, and could not be
apprehended.</P>
<P>Upon this Di&s;a&s;ter, great Contention follow|ed
among the &s;everal Parties: The Nobility
came &s;everal Times together in order to chu&s;e
a new Regent, and parted without bringing it to
a Conclu&s;ion, and the Queen's Party grew very
&s;trong, particularly the City of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> &s;ided
with her. At la&s;t <HI>Matthew,</HI> Earl of <HI>Lenox,</HI> Fa|ther
to the late murthered King, was cho&s;en
Regent.</P>
<P>He carried on the War again&s;t the Queen's
Party, and taking Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Leith,</HI> had &s;eve|ral
Skirmi&s;hes with her Troops, as at <HI>Leith, Dal|keith,</HI>
and other Places; but at la&s;t he is &s;ur|prized at <HI>Sterling,</HI> with a great many of the
Nobility and Gentry, by a Party of the Queen's
Men, who take the Town by Surprize, and took
the Regent, the Earl of <HI>Morton,</HI> and &s;undry
other Pri&s;oners; but the Queen's Men being beat
out of the Town again, and forc'd to quit their
Pri&s;oners, the Regent was &s;hot through by him
that had him Pri&s;oner, becau&s;e he could not
carry him off; for which Fact he was afterwards
hang'd, as he well de&s;erved.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="73">
The Lord <HI>Ereskine,</HI> E. of <HI>Mar,</HI> was then cho&s;en
Regent; but the Queen's Intere&s;t was &s;o &s;trong at
that Time, and the King's &s;o weak, that there was
great Danger of a new Turn in Affairs, and Po|pery
began to hold up its Head; but they had
the Plea&s;ure of being di&s;appointed in that Parti|cular
al&s;o, by the Turn of Affairs in <HI>England</HI>
with the Queen; who, on a Di&s;covery of her
Plot there with the Duke of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> was clo&s;er
confined, and afterwards tryed for her Life,
and beheaded: With her fell all the Hopes of
Popery in <HI>Scotland.</HI> But the Church found other
Enemies to &s;truggle with, in &s;ome Re&s;pects, as
fatal to her Pro&s;perity as the Papi&s;ts, of which
we &s;hall find Cau&s;e to &s;peak more particularly
in the Second Part of this Work.</P>
<P>But to return to the Affairs in Hand. As
this Revolution was again&s;t the Intere&s;t of
the Queen and her Party, &s;o it was a farther,
and, I think, I may call it a compleat E&s;tabli&s;h|ment
of the Church; for whatever Factions and
Parties were form'd in the State, the Nobility
frequently changing Parties as their Intere&s;ts and
Fortunes guided them, yet they all joined in
the Matter of the Reformation, and the confe|derated
Lords were entirely in the Intere&s;t of
Religion: But to look into this we mu&s;t go
back again to the fir&s;t &s;eizing the Queen.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Murray</HI> being declared Regent,
as above, was, while he lived, a very great Fur|therance
to the E&s;tabli&s;hment of the Church:
That great Man being not only a vigorous and
con&s;tant Friend to the Reformation, but a mo&s;t
pious, religious and &s;incere Profe&s;&s;or of it him|&s;elf</P>
<P>Things heing in &s;o good a Po&s;ture for the
Church, when the Queen was taken Pri&s;oner,
<PB N="71" REF="74">
the fir&s;t Parliament was holden at <HI>Edinburgh De|cember</HI>
15, 1567, in the Name of the King, tho'
but an Infant; and the fir&s;t Thing they went
about was, to recognize the whole Proceedings
of the Reformation in the following Acts.</P>
<P><HI>1st,</HI> An Act aboli&s;hing the Juri&s;diction and
u&s;urp'd Authority of the Pope, which was
&s;till no more than confirming the Act
made before for that Purpo&s;e; but it was
done becau&s;e the Papi&s;ts rai&s;ed &s;ome Obje|ctions
again&s;t the Validity of that Parlia|ment,
the Queen having not given her A&s;|&s;ent
to their Meeting, nor confirmed the
Articles at <HI>Leith.</HI></P>
<P><HI>2d,</HI> Another Act pa&s;t, for repealing former
Laws for e&s;tabli&s;hing Popery.</P>
<P><HI>3d,</HI> The Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith was ratified.</P>
<P><HI>4th,</HI> An Act appointing, That all Kings and
Magi&s;trates &s;hould, at the Time of enter|ing
upon their Offices, &s;wear to maintain
the Church, expre&s;&s;ed in the&s;e Words: <HI>To
maintain the true Religion as now received.</HI></P>
<P>The Polity and Juri&s;diction of the Church
was, <HI>&s;ays Spot&s;wood,</HI> referred to Delegates, and
the Thirds of Benefices were, for the pre&s;ent,
granted to the Church; the Nece&s;&s;ity of the Times
made it impo&s;&s;ible to obtain the re&s;t: For the
publick Affairs requiring the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of all its
Intere&s;t, the remaining Revenues of the Church
were retained to the Service of the Nation.</P>
<P>In this Parliament the King's Authority be|ing
acknowledged, the Queen, his Mother, was
concluded <HI>to perpetual Impri&s;onment,</HI> which was
then thought very &s;evere, and brought a great
many to e&s;pou&s;e her Quarrel, in meer Compa&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="72" REF="75">
to her Circum&s;tances; and this, facilitating
her E&s;cape, as before, filled the Nation with a
long Series of Blood, Tumult, and Di&s;order.</P>
<P>Yet under all the&s;e Turmoils the Church
was &s;upported in her Juri&s;diction, as well as
Doctrine; and therefore here I fix the Period
of what I call her Infant-State: And I think
my Opinion is back'd very much by that fa|mous
Letter of the General A&s;&s;embly of the
Kirk, <HI>Anno</HI> 1567, being the &s;ame Year I am
now upon.</P>
<P>The Letter was to Mr. <HI>Willock,</HI> one of their
Mini&s;ters, and one who was particularly famous
for his Share in the Reformation; but was fled
into <HI>England</HI> from the Troubles of the fir&s;t
Years of the Queen's Return: This Man the
A&s;&s;embly writes to, to invite him to come back
again: And their Rea&s;ons to move him to re|turn
were, `That they had a religious and zea|lous
Magi&s;trate con&s;tituted, meaning the Earl
of <HI>Murray,</HI> commonly called the <HI>Gude Regent;</HI>
&s;ufficient Provi&s;ion appointed for Mini&s;ters, the
Church e&s;tabli&s;hed, and Religion flouri&s;hing
throughout the Realm&mdash;and they conclude
their Letter, <HI>Now you &s;hall &s;ee the Cope-Stone of
that Work whereof you laid the Foundation.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, that the Book of Polity or Di&s;ci|pline
was not to this Day e&s;tabli&s;h'd by Par|liament,
and therefore the Church had not all
the Authority that they wi&s;h'd in the Matters
of Juri&s;diction, Government, and Di&s;cipline.
But the Gentlemen that would di&s;pute here the
Priority of Epi&s;copal Government in the Church
to Presbyterial, will get nothing by that; for
all this while the Church exerci&s;ed a compleat
Presbyterial Juri&s;diction, and no other; had
their exact regular Meetings of Kirk or pa|rochial
<PB N="73" REF="76">
Se&s;&s;ions, Presbyteries, Synods, and Ge|neral
A&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P>The Nobility, upon all Occa&s;ions, &s;igned the
Book of Di&s;cipline, and the Book of Polity was
frequently revi&s;ed, and in this Parliament was
ordered to be revi&s;ed again.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hops that remained, had nothing left
them but a mini&s;terial Authority, and were e|qually
&s;ubjected to Presbytery, Synod, and A&s;|&s;embly;
and the Superintendency, of which &s;o
much is alledged to prove it an Equivalent to
Epi&s;copacy, was under all the e&s;&s;ential Articles
of a Parity; a famous In&s;tance of which was
the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Orkney,</HI> whowao, as a private Mi|ni&s;ter,
cen&s;ured in the fir&s;t A&s;&s;embly of the King,
for &s;olemnizing the adulterous Marriage of the
Queen with <HI>Bothwell,</HI> and was deprived by them

of <HI>Fife</HI> was cen&s;ured for his Negligence in Vi&s;i|tation,
and that he was carele&s;s in puni&s;hing A|dulterers.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="77">
The&s;e are &s;uch plain Acts of Presbyterial Ju|ri&s;diction
over the Superintendents, that nothing
can be needful to add to it. In the &s;ame A&s;&s;em|bly
was the Form of Excommunication appro|ved,
and ordered to be printed, and is affixed
ju&s;t before the P&s;alms in Meeter.</P>

which will be al&s;o found at large in <HI>Calder|$$od</HI>'s Hi&s;tory, <HI>fol.</HI> 45.</P>
<P>The Principal, and &s;ome of the Regents of the

the A&s;&s;embly, for refu&s;ing to acknowledge the &s;e|veral
Laws of e&s;tabli&s;hing the Church, and other
Things objected; but they were deprived not
by the Superintendent, but by the Superinten|dent,
together with the Mini&s;ters and Commi&s;&s;i|oners,
and the Superintendent acted only as Com|mi&s;&s;ioner
from the A&s;&s;embly, as is to this Day
to be &s;een in the Regi&s;ter.</P>
<P>As to Di&s;cipline the Practice of it was, tho'
not e&s;tabli&s;hed, yet every Day regulated and
directed by the A&s;&s;embly. And if there were
any difficult Things in Matters of Order and
Dicipline, it was only owing to this, that the

<P>_I Have fix'd the Period of the Church's

of the Reformation &s;eem'd
to be laid in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the
Church arrived to a Condition to &s;tand upon
her own Feet.</P>
<P>Her doctrinal Articles were a&s;&s;ented to, and
her Wor&s;hip e&s;tabli&s;h'd, and both confirmed
by &s;undry Acts of Parliament, under the Ad|mini&s;tration
<PB N="76" REF="79">
of the fir&s;t Regents, the Earl of
<HI>Murray,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Lenox:</HI> Likewise her
Judicatories took Place, her Churches were
planted, and her Di&s;cipline was agreed to, &s;o
that as, in the Letter of the A&s;&s;embly to Mr.
<HI>Willock,</HI> is noted, <HI>The Church was fully planted:</HI>
As to her inte&s;tine Troubles, they &s;eemed in|deed
to be but begun; for the Polity of the
<HI>Kirk,</HI> it was not yet e&s;tabli&s;h'd, nor could they
ever bring the Book of Di&s;cipline to be pa&s;t in|to
an Act in the Convention or Parliament of
that Day. At this Door crept in all the Mi&s;|chiefs
that for above 120 Years after, continu|ally
harra&s;s'd this Church, and brought her &s;e|veral
Times under the Yoke, both of temporal
and eccle&s;ia&s;tick Tyranny; &s;everal Times into
cruel and bloody Per&s;ecutions, and more than
once to the very Gates of De&s;truction, as &s;hall
be &s;een in its Order.</P>
<P>The Church had been now 14 Years in her
fir&s;t Struggles with Popery, had enjoyed her
General A&s;&s;emblies 12 Years, and tho' the Go|vernment
of the Church was not pa&s;t into a
Law by the Civil Sanction of a Parliament, as
is ob&s;erved above, yet the greate&s;t Part of the
Nobility and Gentry had &s;igned it; and all that
Part which was needful to the true Di&s;cipline
of the Church was fully practi&s;ed by the Mi|ni&s;ters
in their particular Churches, and fre|quently
regulated in their General A&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P>But as in all the Ages of the Church, the
Pro&s;perity of their Affairs has led them into
mutual Jarrings, Divi&s;ions, and Jealou&s;ies, which
con&s;equently u&s;hered in Multitudes of Innovati|ons;
<HI>&s;o it was here:</HI> The Ambition and Emula|tion
of the Clergy and Nobility u&s;hered in a
Model of Epi&s;copal Government, which, as it
<PB N="77" REF="80">
was at fir&s;t a <HI>Motley Scheme</HI> of Church-Govern|ment,
compo&s;ed neither of Presbytery nor Pre|lacy,
&s;o it laid the Foundation of its own Cor|ruptions,
and in them of all the Confu&s;ions
which followed in the Church, as will appear
hereafter.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Step to this, was in the Year 1572,
when, upon the old Foot of &s;ettling and per|fecting
the Polity of the Church, that fatal
Commi&s;&s;ion was granted <HI>to &s;ettle the Kirk,</HI> of
which in its Place. The Regent was now the
Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> who, tho' a Prote&s;tant, was, it
$&s;eems, particularly inclined to the <HI>new Scheme</HI> of
Church-Government which had been propo&s;ed
in an A&s;&s;embly or Convention of the Church
at <HI>Leith,</HI> viz. to re&s;tore the Government of
<HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> as it was in the Time before the Refor|mation:
And as there was a &s;trong Party even
among the Mini&s;ters who fell in with the Court,
and no doubt the Hopes of Church-Preferment
had moved &s;ome, they &s;oon were prevail'd with
to join with the Party that pretended to &s;ettle
the Church according to that Scheme.</P>
<P>In order to this, a Commi&s;&s;ion was grant|ed
to a certain Number of Gentlemen to treat
with a like Number of Mini&s;ters, to be com|mi&s;&s;ioned
by the General A&s;&s;embly, and to con|&s;ider
of, &s;ettle, and conclude anent all Things
tending to the E&s;tabli&s;hing the <HI>Polity of the Kirk.</HI></P>
<P>And this was that famous, or rather fatal
Commi&s;&s;ion which fir&s;t brought Epi&s;copacy into
the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and their Act was expre&s;|&s;ed
in the&s;e Words:</P>
<P><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Calderwood, <HI>Hi&s;t. fol.</HI> 50.</NOTE> &startq;They think good, in Con&s;ideration of
the pre&s;ent E&s;tate, that the Names and Titles
<PB N="78" REF="81">
of Archbi&s;hops and Bi&s;hops be not innova|ted,
nor the Bounds of the Dioce&s;&s;es confound|ed&mdash;but
&s;tand and continue in Time coming
as they did before the Reformation, at lea&s;ttill
the King's Majority, or till Con&s;ent of
Parliament.&endq;</P>
<P>Epi&s;copacy being thus brought in, as we call
it, by Head and Shoulders into the Church,
did not, however, an&s;wer their End who brought
it in; for at fir&s;t it came in &s;o fetter'd and
&s;hackled with Limitation of Power and Ca&s;tra|tion
of Stipends, that there was little in it
more than was before in the Mini&s;ters, who
were called <HI>Superintendents;</HI> the Name and Dig|nities
excepted. And here it is worth ob&s;er|ving,
that the true Rea&s;on appeared both why
the Church could never obtain a Parliamentary
E&s;tabli&s;hment of their Book of Di&s;cipline, as al|&s;o
why the Nobility and Gentry fell in &s;o &s;ud|denly
with this new Model; the Ca&s;e is very
plain: Under this Model the Gentlemen retain|ed

$word$ which they could never before obtain under the

Church, and Hinderance of the Planting Mini|&s;ters
in many Parts of the Country.</P>
<P>However, the Clergy found Ways to help
them&s;elves as to the Revenue in after Times.
This was the fir&s;t Condition they came into the
Church in, and this &s;imoniacal Project, for it
was no le&s;s, (<HI>viz.</HI>) giving Part of the Church's
Revenues to the Nobility, that they might have
their Vote to po&s;&s;e&s;s the re&s;t; this &s;imoniacal
Project, I &s;ay, was the fir&s;t Rea&s;on of the In|troduction
of Bi&s;hops into the Church of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;hall now &s;ee how this Matter reli&s;h'd
with the Reformers, and whether, as &s;ome al|ledge,
it was a general Act of the Reformation,
<HI>YEA,</HI> or <HI>NO.</HI> In <HI>February.</HI> 1572, a new Bi|&s;hop
was inaugurated at St. <HI>Andrews:</HI> Mr. <HI>Knox</HI>
prote&s;ted again&s;t it, and pronounced his Ana|thema,
or great Cur&s;e again&s;t both Giver and
Receiver.</P>
<P>But the Ca&s;e was much altered in <HI>Scotland</HI> at
this Time among the Gentry and Nobility.
(1.) Abundance of the fir&s;t Reformers, debauch|ed
by the Luxury of the Court, and touch'd
upon the Niceties of Allegiance, adhered to the
Queen, who was Popi&s;h, tho' they them&s;elves
were Prote&s;tants; &s;uch was the Duke of <HI>Chatel|lerault,</HI>
the Earls of <HI>Argyle, Rothe&s;s,</HI> Laird of
<HI>Grange,</HI> and others. (2.) Of the re&s;t, the Inte|re&s;t
of the Nobility in the Church's Revenues,
made them all &s;lack in the Matter of the Church
<HI>Polity,</HI> &s;hy of the extraordinary Authority of the
A&s;&s;embly, and aver&s;e to the Severity of Di&s;ci|pline.</P>
<P>The two fir&s;t Regents the Earls of <HI>Murray</HI>
and <HI>Lenox,</HI> adher'd hone&s;tly and faithfully to the
Church, and were the con&s;tant Patrons of her
<PB N="80" REF="83">
Settlement: The Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> the third Regent,
was both zealous for the Reformation, and re|ligious
in his Per&s;on; but gave way a little too
early to the abovementioned Court-Principle, I
mean as to their retaining the Church's Reve|nues.
But the Earl of <HI>Morton,</HI> who &s;ucceeded
him, openly invaded the Authority of the A&s;|&s;embly,
and throwing off the Mask, protected
the Bi&s;hops in u&s;urping an Authority indepen|dent
of the A&s;&s;embly; and by the &s;ame Con&s;e|quence,
placing an Authority in the Prince to
appoint the Bi&s;hop. And thus he did the Drudg|ery
of the Party, for which they ill rewarded
him afterward, as will appear in the Cour&s;e of
this Story.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Introduction of Bi&s;hops, as above,
left them fetter'd and &s;hackled, as I noted, under
the Power of the A&s;&s;embly; and tho' even the
Name gave Offence, yet they were &s;o reduc'd,
as that the Name began not to be que&s;tioned,
and &s;uch the Church will not di&s;pute to this

Bi&s;hops, yet they were really only Superinten|dents,

Bi&s;hop <HI>Spot&s;wood</HI> affirms po&s;itively, that the Su|perintendent's

&s;everal Times before<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Calderwood, <HI>fol. 73, 74, 75, 77, 80. The Regent ever re&s;i&s;ted the Work of the Polity, which was then in Hand, and pre&s;&s;ed his own Injunctions and Conformity with</HI> England.</NOTE>. Mr. <HI>Calderwood</HI> gives
a long Account of the Conference of the Mini|&s;ters
in the <HI>We&s;t,</HI> with tho&s;e appointed by the

to which I refer; the Thing not being
obtained, 'tis not to my Purpo&s;e to enter into
Particulars other than this, that the Presbyterial
Authority was clearly e&s;tabli&s;h'd in it, and the
very Name as well as Office and Power of a
Bi&s;hop left out.</P>
<P>The Regent, who oppo&s;ed them in all Things,
did &s;o, underhand, in this; for it was evident
he pu&s;h'd not at the introducing the Bi&s;hops on|ly,
<PB N="86" REF="89">
but even at the Di&s;&s;olution of the A&s;&s;embly,
who&s;e Authority was too great for him, and
made him unea&s;ie.&mdash;However, the Form was
pre&s;ented, as above, and he did not openly re|ject
it; but &s;tarted Objections, and appointed
Que&s;tions to be an&s;wered, and nam'd a Commit|tee
of the Council to confer with them about
it.</P>
<P>But now a new Revolution of Affairs hap|pened;
for Factions ri&s;ing, among the Nobility,
again&s;t the Regent, and, as it was thought, he
being &s;en&s;ible of his being too weak for them,
was advi&s;ed to &s;toop to the Juncture of Affairs,
quietly to concede his Authority, and demit that
Power which, it was manife&s;t, he could not
keep.</P>
<P>The King was now almo&s;t Twelve Years old,
and tho' he was under Governours, yet the Fa|ction
of Lords not agreeing who to repo&s;e the
Tru&s;t in, it was re&s;olved to declare the King
<HI>MAJOR,</HI> and put the Government into his
own Hands. This al&s;o &s;eemed the more ho|nourable
for the Regent; for to have named
another after him, had been plainly to have told
the World he was turned out&mdash;but to re&s;ign
his Government into the King's own Hand, had
a much greater Appearance of Honour.</P>
<P>He did &s;o: But as great Mens Fall &s;eldom
&s;top with the Lo&s;s of their Preferments, &s;o it
was with him; he pa&s;t through various Trou|bles,
till at la&s;t the Per&s;ecution of his Enemies
brought him to the Block.</P>
<P>The King was young, but began to be infor|med
of Things, and as well from <HI>Morton</HI> at
fir&s;t, as the re&s;t of the Courtiers about him af|terwards,
he received too early Prejudices a|gain&s;t
the Con&s;titution of the Church, and in
<PB N="87" REF="90">
particular he took all Occa&s;ions to intrench upon
the Power of the A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>The Debate was now wholly about Bi&s;hops, the
A&s;&s;embly was for reducing their Power, which
was effectually done as before; they were now
for reducing the Name too, as a Thing which
they found furni&s;hed Matter of continual Di|&s;turbance:
So in the Third Se&s;&s;ion of the A&s;|&s;embly
1577, it was ordained, <HI>That all Bi&s;hops
and others, bearing Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Function, be called
by their own Names, or Brethren only</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><HI>Calderwood</HI>'s Hi&s;t fol. 82. That the &s;aid Act &s;hall be ex|$ended to all Times to come, and till the Corruption of the State of Bi&s;hops be utterly removed out of the Church.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the Seventh Se&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame A&s;&s;embly
they put a Stop to the Number, and ordered
that no Bi&s;hop be elected or admitted before
the next General A&s;&s;embly; for bidding Mini&s;ters
and Chapters to elect, or any way proceed to
the Election of any Bi&s;hop, on Pain of Depriva|tion.</P>
<P>In the A&s;&s;embly at <HI>Sterling,</HI> in <HI>June</HI> 1578, they
made the &s;aid Law perpetual, and that all Bi|&s;hops
already elected, be required to &s;ubmit
them&s;elves to the General A&s;&s;embly. And thus
that infant mongrel Epi&s;copacy, <HI>&s;o it was then
called,</HI> was voted out of the Church as a Nu&s;ance.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame A&s;&s;embly they appointed a Com|mittee
to wait upon the King with the Book of
Polity and a Supplication, which was done; and
they were received well enough by the King
with good Words and Promi&s;es of Kindne&s;s and
Countenance, and a certain Number named by
the Council to confer with them; tho' the King
him&s;elf &s;ecretly hated both their Per&s;ons and
<PB N="88" REF="91">
Mea&s;ures, for which Rea&s;on nothing could be
obtained by that Conference.</P>
<P>The <HI>16th</HI> of <HI>July</HI> after, the Parliament met;
and the Commi&s;&s;ioners, appointed by the A&s;&s;em|bly
to wait upon the Parliament, &s;ollicited to
have the Book of Polity brought in there, and
confirmed; but the Nobility always put it off,
having, as afterwards appeared, no Kindne&s;s
for the Strictne&s;s and Severity of Presbyterian
Di&s;cipline.</P>
<P><HI>Morton</HI>'s Fall was not yet; for he &s;till guid|ed
the King, and in&s;tilled early Thoughts into
him in Prejudice of the Kirk, and in Favour of
the Bi&s;hops.</P>
<P>However the Church went on again&s;t them,
and the A&s;&s;embly fell particularly upon two by
Name, <HI>viz.</HI> Mr. <HI>Patrick Adam&s;on,</HI> whom <HI>Morton,</HI>
by his Letter, had made Bi&s;hop of St. <HI>Andrews,</HI>
and Mr. <HI>John Boyd</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Gla&s;gow.</HI></P>
<P>But now a &s;econd Attempt was made upon the
Church, and that was by the King him&s;elf, or at
lea&s;t in his Name. The A&s;&s;embly, as has been
noted, having long &s;truggled to obtain their
Book of Polity, they had been always, tho' not
ab&s;olutely denied to have it pa&s;s, yet &s;o delay'd
and po&s;tponed, that it was ea&s;ie to &s;ee the
Court was again&s;t them, and that it was not
de&s;ign'd to be pa&s;s'd at all; neverthele&s;s they went
on upon the Foot of the Scheme form'd, as what
was their ju&s;t Right to demand, tho' they had
not Influence enough upon the Government to
obtain the Grant.</P>
<P>Being thus, as I have noted, proceeding up|on
the Foot of the Polity <HI>as their Right,</HI> they
receive a Letter from the King, dated at <HI>Sterling</HI>
the <HI>6th</HI> of <HI>July</HI> 1579, inhibiting them to proceed
and commanding them to refer all the Matter$

<P>The A&s;&s;embly, notwith&s;tanding this Letter,
went on; but with all the Caution and Re&s;pect
po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>They examine the Articles referred, and pre|&s;ent
an Addre&s;s to the King, de&s;iring a farther
Conference upon the Affair of the Polity, and
followed this with a long Supplication, to move
the King to farther this Book of Polity.</P>
<P>While this was in Con&s;ideration, and 2 or 3
Years &s;pent in the pre&s;&s;ing the Polity on one
Hand, and putting it off on the other, in the
Year 1580; the General A&s;&s;embly finding, as
they apprehended, that all they had yielded to
before as to the Word Bi&s;hop, was improved to
enlarge the Office and extend the Power of a
Bi&s;hop, they re&s;olve to pull it up by the Roots,
and remove the very Name of it out of the
Church; and in order to this, they pa&s;s two Acts,
entirely abrogating the Office as un&s;criptural,
declaring it void and unlawful, as having no
Warrant or Foundation in the Word of God:

Putting all the&s;e Accounts together with as
much Impartiality as po&s;&s;ible, 'tis manife&s;t, and,
I think, out of Di&s;pute, that the Church of <HI>Scot|land</HI>
was in its original <HI>PRESBYTERIAN.</HI>
I have nothing to do here with the Difference or
the Di&s;putes about which is the mo&s;t &s;criptural,
Epi&s;copacy <HI>or</HI> Presbytery, that Di&s;pute is han|dled
very &s;trongly by its &s;elf; but <HI>the Rea&s;on I
have been &s;o long on this Part, is to clear up the
Que&s;tion which has been the Occa&s;ion of &s;o much De|bate
in the World, whether the fir&s;t Reformation of</HI>
Scotland <HI>was</HI> Epi&s;copal or Presbyterian.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="94">
The Court had indeed, from the latter End
of the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI>'s Admini&s;tration, &s;trug|gled
hard with the A&s;&s;embly to re&s;erve its own
Power, and to have &s;ome Share in the Matter

and afterwards overthrew it all again, and by
<HI>the&s;e Acts</HI> entirely aboli&s;hed the very Name of
a Bi&s;hop in the Church.</P>
<P>I come now to enter into a &s;ad Series of Strife

Struggles, <HI>&V;ps,</HI> and <HI>Downs,</HI> intervals of Liberty,
Storms of Tyranny, &s;ome horrid Scenes of

<P>The Court were, no que&s;tion, very ill plea|&s;ed
with this Proceeding of the A&s;&s;embly&mdash;but
they went &s;till on with Steadine&s;s: Several of
the Bi&s;hops &s;ubmitted to this Order of the A&s;&s;|embly,
and made their Submi&s;&s;ion, the Copies
of which, by after Times, their Succe&s;&s;ors be|ing
a&s;hamed &s;o plain a Te&s;timony of Fact &s;hould

<P><PB N="92" REF="95">
At length the King being advanced, by the
Death of the Queen of <HI>England,</HI> to the united
Crown of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> the Di&s;putes re&s;ted for
&s;ome Time, the Court being taken up with the
Rejoicings of their new Acqui&s;ition, and with
the other Incidents of the new Government:
And by this Means the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> may
be &s;aid to have got &s;ome Ground, even at that
Time when the King, who was their avow'd
Enemy, was &s;o encreas'd in Power as to be for|midable
to them.</P>
<P>But the King was taken up with Mirth, and
the Court in Revels, I had almo&s;t &s;aid in De|bauchery;
and not the King only, but the No|bility
al&s;o, who were always the Hinderers of
the Reformation, were now ab&s;ent, and not &s;o
much concerned about what became of the
Church, when they had their private Fortunes
to make by the Favour of their Prince. This
Ab&s;ence of the Court, I &s;ay, gave the Church
great Advantage, and the General A&s;&s;embly con|tinued
to a&s;&s;ert and maintain their E&s;tabli&s;h|ment
as Presbyterian in oppo&s;ition to Epi&s;copa|cy,
notwith&s;tanding all the Injunctions and In|terruptions
which they met with from the
Court, and therefore this may very well be cal|led
the growing State of the Kirk.</P>
<P>But to go back to what happened in the mean
Time. It was about the Year 1582, that the
King, by the ill Government of the Duke of
<HI>Lenox,</HI> Earl of <HI>Arran,</HI> &amp;c. who had him, as it
might be &s;aid, in Tutelage, had not only im|po&s;ed
and intruded the &s;o much abhorred Pre|lacy
upon the Church, but had in&s;ulted the
Church in their Di&s;cipline and Government on
many Occa&s;ions, too long to relate; as particu|larly
in the Affair of <HI>Montgomery,</HI> and the Tu|mult
<PB N="93" REF="96">
in <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> where, in defence of a Man ex|communicated
for notorious Scandal, they mob|bed
the Presbytery, beat and very ill treated
Mr. <HI>John Howi&s;on</HI> the Moderator, and wounded
&s;everal of the Students of the College; nor was
it far from &s;etting Fire to the College it &s;elf: It
was &s;aid, that &s;ome of the King's Guards were
employed upon this Riot, to encourage a Tu|mult;
for that the common People could not
otherwi&s;e be brought to injure the Mini&s;ters
after &s;uch a Manner.</P>
<P>But the Kirk recovered all this, when a few
Weeks after happened that memorable Attempt
of the Noblemen again&s;t <HI>Lenox</HI> and <HI>Arran,</HI> cal|led
the Rode of <HI>Ruthven,</HI> taking the King out
of their Hands, by Force, and carrying him to
<HI>Sterling.</HI> This, I &s;ay, was called the <HI>Rode</HI> of
<HI>Ruthven,</HI> of which we &s;hall hear a great deal
more, and was put in Execution <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 20, 1582,
as the King came back from the great annual
hunting in <HI>Athol.</HI></P>
<P>It is not to our Purpo&s;e to enter into the Hi|&s;tory
or Cau&s;es of this Attempt: It is enough
to &s;ay, that the Power of the&s;e two Noblemen,
or at lea&s;t their imprudent exerci&s;ing of that
Power was become intollerable to the Nation,
and the re&s;t of the Nobility and Gentry con|cerned,
found no other way to deliver them&s;elves
from it, but to &s;et the King at Liberty to act
by better Council.</P>
<P>They pre&s;ented a Declaration to the King of
their Rea&s;ons for this Conduct, and carrying his
Maje&s;ty to <HI>Sterling,</HI> they gave him full Liberty
of his Per&s;on and a free Exerci&s;e of his Govern|ment,
only taking Care that the Admini&s;tration
was entirely removed from the hated Hands of
<HI>Lenox</HI> and <HI>Arran.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="97">
The King, tho' he never forgave this Action,
and to his la&s;t re&s;ented it again&s;t the Kirk, as if
they had been the only In&s;truments, yet com|plied
with the Time, and the Earl of <HI>Arran</HI>
being clapp'd up in <HI>Duplin</HI> Ca&s;tle, and the Duke
of <HI>Lenox,</HI> charg'd by Proclamation, to depart
the Country, his Maje&s;ty con&s;ented that a Pro|clamation
&s;hould be publi&s;hed, intimating that
he was i$n the Town of <HI>Perth,</HI> at full Liberty;
that he &s;taid there of his own Choice for &s;ome
Time, and that he approved of all the Lords
had done as for his Intere&s;t and Service. At
the &s;ame Time a Proclamation was al&s;o publi&s;h|ed
for re&s;toring the Liberties of the Kirk, the
Freedom of their A&s;&s;emblies and Judicatures,
and for encouraging the Mini&s;ters in Di&s;charge
of their Duty.</P>
<P>Thus the Church got the Day of their Ad|ver&s;aries,
and all Violences offered to their Judi|catures,
the Laws made to re&s;train their Li|berties
or abridge their Rights, were declared
to be unju&s;t and illegal, and were laid to the
Charge of the &s;aid Duke of <HI>Lenox</HI> and Earl of$&punc;</P>
<P><HI>Arran; S&V;CH AS</HI> the Di&s;po&s;ition of Bene|fices
<HI>Pleno Jure,</HI> without the Examination of
the Per&s;ons, and Admi&s;&s;ion by the Kirk, making
the King and his Council Judges in Matters
meerly eccle&s;ia&s;tical; di&s;charging or prohibiting
the General A&s;&s;embly to proceed to Excommu|nication;
annulling the Sentence of Excommu|nication
when pa&s;t; Prelacy obtruded upon them
contrary to the Principles of the Church of <HI>Scot|land,</HI>
who had declared in the General A&s;&s;embly,
that the &s;ame was un&s;criptural, devili&s;h, and of$
humane Invention, <HI>and the like.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this Declaration a General A&s;&s;embly
was convened to meet at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> the <HI>9th of
<PB N="95" REF="98">
October</HI> 1582, and this was perhaps the fir&s;t A&s;|&s;embly,
even from the Reformation, in which
it might be &s;aid the Church had an uninterrupted
Liberty to exert her full Power in her own E|&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>At this A&s;&s;embly the Laird of <HI>Pai&s;ly,</HI> in the
Name of the a&s;&s;ociated Lords, declared, that
the Dangers of the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Con&s;titution,
and of Religion it &s;elf, as well as the Danger
of the King's Per&s;on and of the Civil Govern|ment,
were the principal Cau&s;es of their late
Undertaking, and they de&s;ired the Concurrence
of the A&s;&s;embly, as well in recognizing the
Nece&s;&s;ity of what had been done, as in concert|ing
what was yet to be done for the e&s;tabli&s;h|ing
and &s;ecuring both the Church and State.</P>
<P>The A&s;&s;embly unanimou&s;ly voted (every Mem|ber
being &s;everally asked) the Reality of the
Dangers attending the Reformation and the
Church. The King, upon the A&s;&s;embly's &s;ending
&s;ome of their Body to him, readily declared,
that not only his own Per&s;on, but Religion it
&s;elf was in Peril, and that &s;uch Mea&s;ures had
been entered into as mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have over|turn'd
the Reformation; that he e&s;teem'd his
own Safety and the Safety of Religion to be in|&s;eparable,
and exhorted the A&s;&s;embly to do their
Duty to remove the Dangers that threatned
$oth him and them.</P>
<P>This occa&s;ioned that famous Act of the
A&s;&s;embly, wherein the Reformation is recog|$ized,
and the pur&s;uing it recommended earn|&s;tly
as well to Mini&s;ters as People; all the
$ini&s;ters are exhorted to &s;et forth the Dangers
$f the Church, the King, and the Common|$ealth
to their Flocks, in the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing
$anner, urging all who love and tender the
<PB N="96" REF="99">
Glory of God, the pro&s;perous State of the King
and Common-wealth, to concur with them in
their Endeavour to their full Deliverance.</P>
<P>After this the A&s;&s;embly proceeded with Vi|gour
to exert them&s;elves: They erected Pres|byteries
and Church-Judicatures in &s;uch Parts
where there were none before, as in the North|ern
Provinces of <HI>Sutherland, Caithne&s;s, Ro&s;s,
Murray, Aberdeen,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Then they empowered the Presbyteries to &s;um|mon
before them the Bi&s;hops, and to cau&s;e them
to an&s;wer to the &s;aid Presbyteries for &s;uch
Offences as they &s;hould be accu&s;ed of: The
Crimes the &s;aid Bi&s;hops were thus accu&s;ed of
were &s;uch as the&s;e:</P>
<Q><P>Not Preaching, and admini&s;tring the Sacra|ments,
as is the Duty of a Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>Neglect in Di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>Error in Doctrine.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;ociating them&s;elves with excommunica|ted
Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Wa&s;ting of the Patrimony of the Kirk.</P>
<P>Letting Lea&s;es of Land again&s;t the Prohibi|tions
of the Kirk.</P>
<P>Collating to Benefices again&s;t the Tenor of
the Acts of the Kirk.</P>
<P>Scandal in Life and Conver&s;ation.</P></Q>
<P>And many other Things, not then articled,
which were left to the Examination of Wit|ne&s;&s;es.
And the Presbyteries were farther em|powered
to hear, try, acquit, and condemn, as
the Matters of Fact &s;hould appear to them.</P>
<P>The Time was now come when the Autho|rity
of the Church had its full E&s;tabli&s;hment&punc;
The Convention of E&s;tates, which was the$
<PB N="97" REF="100">
called, and which met at <HI>Perth,</HI> gave Room to
the A&s;&s;embly to lay all their Grievances before
them, which was done in 22 Articles, and
their Demands of particular Redre&s;s for Wrong
and Wreck, <HI>as it was called,</HI> in 11 Articles
more.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hops were now depo&s;ed, and many
of them &s;ubmitted to become Pa&s;tors of private
Pari&s;h-Churches.</P>
<P>The Laird of <HI>Minto,</HI> who, at the Head of a
Mob, had in&s;ulted the Moderator of the Pres|bytery
of <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> &s;ubmitted him&s;elf to the A&s;&s;|embly,
and begg'd Pardon.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Robert Montgomery,</HI> who&s;e Ca&s;e had rai&s;ed
&s;uch Di&s;putes between the King and the Church;
the Church excommunicating him, and the
King re&s;toring him by Proclamation; came in
and &s;ubmitted, offering to undergo the Injuncti|ons
of the Presbytery of <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> and de&s;iring
to be received into the Bo&s;m of the Church.</P>
<P>And thus &s;tood the Affairs of the Church at the
Beginning of the Year 1583, but it continued
but for a &s;hort While; for the King, impatient
of the good Government of the Lords, and in|wardly
hating the Church, contriv'd to make his
E&s;cape from <HI>Falkland,</HI> which, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance
of another Faction among the Nobility, he effect|ed
the <HI>28th</HI> of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1583, taking Refuge in the
Ca&s;tle of St. <HI>Andrews:</HI> Thither repair'd imme|diately
all tho&s;e among the Nobility who were
privy to the De&s;ign; and thus they laid the
Foundation of an entire Change of Mea&s;ures and
Per&s;ons in his Admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>As in the State, &s;o in the Church, all
Things tended to Change; &s;aving only that the
A&s;&s;embly, maintaining their Principles, &s;tood
their Ground again&s;t the Court with a Con|&s;tancy
<PB N="98" REF="101">
of Zeal which could never be &s;ubdu|ed.</P>
<P>However, the Bi&s;hops immediately got foot|ing
by <HI>this Turn</HI> of the Court, and the Bi|&s;hop
of St. <HI>Andrews</HI> being in the Ca&s;tle there,
immediately rea&s;&s;umed his Office and Character,
pre&s;uming one the King's Protection, as openly
as if he had been placed in it by a legal Au|thority,
even the King him&s;elf not yet decla|ring
his Con&s;ent to his Attempt.</P>
<P>During the&s;e Tran&s;actions, the General A&s;|&s;embly
conven'd at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> (viz.) the <HI>20th</HI>
of <HI>October;</HI> nor did they &s;lack their Hands in
their Proceedings again&s;t the Bi&s;hops, notwith|&s;tanding
the King appeared now openly of the
Prelatick Party; for they call'd for the Report
of their Commi&s;&s;ioners, appointed by the for|mer
A&s;&s;embly, to proceed again&s;t four Delin|quent
Bi&s;hops, <HI>viz.</HI> the Archbi&s;hop of St. <HI>An|drews,</HI>
the Bi&s;hops of the <HI>I&s;les, Dunkeld,</HI> and
<HI>Dumblain.</HI></P>
<P>The Archbi&s;hop had been &s;ummoned by the
Synod of <HI>Fife, apud acta,</HI> to appear at this A&s;|&s;embly,
which, he now thinking him&s;elf too
high to &s;ubmit to, declined to do; &s;o they pro|ceeded
again&s;t him as in Contempt; and the
Proce&s;s again&s;t his Woman Coun&s;ellor <HI>Ali&s;on
Pear&s;one,</HI> as a Witch, was al&s;o brought before
the A&s;&s;embly, and a Committee was a appoint|ed
to examine Witne&s;&s;es again&s;t them both.</P>
<P>They al&s;o re&s;olved now to make a Repre&s;en|tation
of their Grievances, and of the State of
the Church and Kingdom, and lay the &s;ame
before the King him&s;elf in Di&s;charge of them|&s;elves:
This &s;ome of the Mini&s;ters pre&s;t with
the more Earne&s;tne&s;s, prophetically &s;ugge&s;ting
that a Cloud of Darkne&s;s and Per&s;ecution was
<PB N="99" REF="102">
coming upon them, and would break over their
Heads in a violent and furious Storm, as well
from the Prelates as from the King him&s;elf.
The Heads of this Repre&s;entation are at large
to be &s;een in the Hi&s;tories of tho&s;e Times. Ha|ving
drawn out their<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Calderwood, <HI>Hi&s;t. fol.</HI> 142.</NOTE> Grievances, &s;ome of
which pointed directly at the King as a Fa|vourer
of the Enemies of God, as well Popi&s;h
as prelatick; they &s;ent Ten Commi&s;&s;ioners
with it to the King then at <HI>Sterling:</HI> They were
very coldly received, and told, that the King
advi&s;ed the A&s;&s;embly to keep within the Bounds
of their proper Bu&s;ine&s;s: The Commi&s;&s;ioners
were &s;ent back again to de&s;ire a more particu|lar
An&s;wer; but were told they had been fully
an&s;wered already.</P>
<P>At this Time two of the mo&s;t bold and zeal|ous
Members of the A&s;&s;embly died, (<HI>viz.</HI>) Mr.
<HI>Alexander Arbuthnot,</HI> Principal of the College at
<HI>Aberdeen,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Thomas Smeton,</HI> Principal of
the College at <HI>Gla&s;gow.</HI> By the Lo&s;s of the&s;e
two great Men their Hands were extremely
weakened in the Struggles they were quickly
to meet with.</P>
<P>However, during the Sitting of this A&s;&s;embly
they abated nothing of what they thought their
Duty: They pro&s;ecuted the Archbi&s;hop to &s;uch
a Hight, that he was obliged to feign an Em|ba&s;&s;y
into <HI>England</HI> upon publick Affairs, <HI>tho'
others &s;aid he was wor&s;e employed,</HI> and fearing a
Sentence of Depo&s;ition, he obtained from the
King to be freed from Cen&s;ure during his Ab|&s;ence.
It was &s;aid, that during this Journey
into <HI>England,</HI> he concerted with &s;ome of the
<PB N="100" REF="103">
Epi&s;copal Clergy there, tho&s;e wicked Mea&s;ures
by which he afterward oppre&s;&s;ed the Church
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and in the End overthrew it for a
Time.</P>
<P>That famous Supporter of the Church's
Cau&s;e, Mr. <HI>John Durie,</HI> was one of the fir&s;t that
felt the Effects of the new Change, being com|manded
by the King to depart from <HI>Edinburgh,</HI>
and remain at <HI>Montro&s;e,</HI> which he &s;ubmitted
to; but both the Town-Council and the Kirk-Se&s;&s;ion of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> gave him noble Te&s;timo|nials
both of his Life and Doctrine; which was
more to his Honour than all the Reproach his
Enemies laid upon him could overballance.</P>
<P>The per&s;ecuting the Mini&s;ters was the fir&s;t
Work the new E&s;tabli&s;hment began with, be|fore
they fell upon the Church it &s;elf; and even
in their dealing with the Mini&s;ters they acted
cautiou&s;ly, and &s;trove to begin with &s;uch Things
as they called legal Pro&s;ecutions for pretended
Offences: Afterwards they grew bolder, and
fell upon them in a gro&s;&s;er Manner.</P>
<P>In the&s;e pretended legal Pro&s;ecutions Mr. <HI>An|drew
Melvin</HI>'s Ca&s;e was the mo&s;t famous Ex|ample:
he was &s;ummoned before the Council,
where he was que&s;tioned for offen&s;ive Words
&s;poken in the Pulpit, on a Fa&s;t-Day, reflecting
on the King and his Admini&s;tration, &s;aying,
<HI>That the King was unlawfully promoted to the Crown,
with other &s;editious Words.</HI> The Univer&s;ity, re|&s;olving to a&s;&s;ert
their Privileges, &s;ent two of
their Body with a Te&s;timonial in his Behalf,
&s;ign'd by 30 of their principal Men, as well
Ma&s;ters as Students, and demanded that he
&s;hould be cen&s;ured only by the Univer&s;ity; the

Liberties of the Church, and Mr. <HI>Melvin</HI> him&s;elf
declin'd the Juri&s;diction of the Council in his
Ca&s;e, in a long Declaration, which is to be &s;een
at large in Mr. <HI>Calderwood</HI>'s Hi&s;tory, <HI>fol.</HI> 144,
145. But all the&s;e were rejected by the Coun|cil.
In this Declaration he both po&s;itively de|nied
the Words, &s;olemnly and before God, pro|te&s;ting
that he never &s;poke them, accu&s;ed the
Informer of Malice and declared Prejudice, and
ju&s;tified what he had really &s;aid to be accord|ing
to God's Word and his own Duty: Upon
giving in this Declaration, he retired into <HI>En|gland,</HI>
having Notice that he was to be confi|ned
in <HI>Blackne&s;s</HI> Ca&s;tle. After his Retreat he
was publickly prai&s;ed, and pray'd for in the
Pulpit by the Mini&s;ters in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> which, as
the Hi&s;tory of tho&s;e Times expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>plea&s;ed</HI>
the People and <HI>galled</HI> the Court.</P>
<P>In the mean Time the Land was full of Trou|bles,
the Lords of <HI>Angus</HI> and <HI>Mar</HI> &s;urprized
the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Sterling;</HI> but their great Friend
<HI>Gowry</HI> being taken, and others &s;ecur'd, and they
being not &s;trong enough to defend them&s;elves
again&s;t the young King, who came again&s;t them
with a great Army, they flsed into <HI>England:</HI>
The Ca&s;tle was &s;urrendered, the Captain and
Three others, who &s;urrendered it, were hanged:
This Attempt weakened the Hands of the
Church and their Friends, making their Enemies
not only more &s;trong, but al&s;o more furious
than they were before. The General A&s;&s;embly
was appointed to be held at St. <HI>Andrews,</HI> the
<HI>24th</HI> of <HI>April</HI> 1584, where the Number of
Mini&s;ters, who dur&s;t appear, were but very
few: The Commi&s;&s;ioner whom the King &s;ent to
them, being their declar'd and enrag'd Enemy,
<PB N="102" REF="105">
his Name was <HI>Graham</HI> of <HI>Halyards,</HI> at that
Time <HI>Ju&s;tice Depute.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Graham</HI> u&s;ed them after an unaccu&s;tom|ed
Manner, exerting a Power which they allow|ed
not to be the Right, even of the King him|&s;elf:
He treated them in a rude and imperions
Manner al&s;o, with all po&s;&s;ible Di&s;re&s;pect. Fir&s;t
he demanded of them, on Pain of Rebelli|on
and Trea&s;on, to annul a former Act of A&s;|&s;embly,
approving the <HI>Rode</HI> of <HI>Ruthven,</HI> and by
a new Act to condemn it. At the &s;ame Time
he entered into a Treaty with the Provo&s;t and
Bailies of St. <HI>Andrews</HI> to impri&s;on tho&s;e Mini|&s;ters
that &s;hould not comply. But the Mini|&s;ters
got Notice of it, and being re&s;olved not
to comply, they &s;ilently declined the A&s;&s;embly,
and dropt out of Town, one by one, leaving
the Commi&s;&s;ioner to &s;it by him&s;elf. He had,
it &s;eems, private In&s;tructions to &s;eize upon Four
of the leading Mini&s;ters, <HI>viz.</HI> Mr. <HI>James Law|&s;one,
David Lynd&s;ey, Patrick Galloway,</HI> and <HI>An|drew Hay.</HI>
The Three fir&s;t appeared in the
A&s;&s;embly, but he being willing to &s;nap them
all at once, waited for the Fourth till tho&s;e
that were there got Notice, and e&s;caped, and
&s;o he mi&s;t them all; for which he was very
much laughed at. The few Mini&s;ters that re|main'd
refu&s;ed to act, giving for An&s;wer, that
they were too few to con&s;titute an A&s;&s;embly;
&s;o the Commi&s;&s;ioner retired.</P>
<P>Note; at this A&s;&s;embly, the Court influencing
the Nobility, the Barons and Gentlemen, who,
as ruling Elders, were u&s;ed to be &s;ent up from
the Provinces, and were allowed to &s;it and vote
with them, were forbid by the Court coming
to the A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="106">
The Four Mini&s;ters abovenamed were &s;ought
after, high and low, to be apprehended, and
would have been put to Death, e&s;pecially Mr.
<HI>Patrick Galloway;</HI> but they made their E&s;cape
for that Time, as did al&s;o many other|Mini&s;ters,
&s;uch as Mr. <HI>John Davi&s;on,</HI> Mr. <HI>James Car|michael,</HI>
Mr. <HI>Andrew Polwart,</HI> and many others.</P>
<P>Now was the Court re&s;olved, in Conjunction
with the Bi&s;hops, to ruin and overthrow the
Church; and to this End, the Negotiations of the
Archbi&s;hop in <HI>England</HI> having &s;ucceeded &s;o far
as to have all po&s;&s;ible Concurrence from thence;
to fini&s;h it the King called a Parliament: In this
Parliament Matters were managed &s;o under|hand
by the Court, that it &s;eemed rather a
private Council, than a Parliament. The Lords
of the Articles, which were a Committee &s;o
called who&s;e Work it was to prepare Bu&s;i|ne&s;s
for the Cognizance of the Hou&s;e, were
&s;worn to Secrecy, and when the Hou&s;e &s;at the
Doors were lock'd up.</P>
<P>However, the Mini&s;ters got Intelligence of
what was doing. <HI>Calderwood</HI> in his Account of
this Part &s;ays, one of the Lords of the Articles
betrayed them, <HI>fol.</HI> 155. Be that as it will, a
Letter was privately &s;ent to the Mini&s;ters in <HI>E|dinburgh,</HI>
from an unknown Hand, a&s;&s;uring them
that the whole Bu&s;ine&s;s of that Parliament was
to de&s;troy the Church, and bid them take &s;peedy
Care about it. The Mini&s;ters knew not what
to do, but they deputed Mr. <HI>David Lind&s;ey,</HI> Mi|ni&s;ter
of <HI>Leith,</HI> who was thought to be a Man
acceptable to the King, to repre&s;ent their Ca&s;e,
and to pray, in the humble&s;t Manner, that an
A&s;&s;embly might be called and heard in Parlia|ment,
before any Thing was done to the Pre|judice
of the Church. But in&s;tead of hearing this,
<PB N="104" REF="107">
the King cau&s;ed Mr. <HI>Lind&s;ey</HI> to be apprehend|ed,
as he was going into the Palace, and car|ried
away to <HI>Blackne&s;s-Ca&s;tle,</HI> without permitting
him to deliver his Me&s;&s;age: They &s;ent other
Me&s;&s;engers, to make Prote&s;t in open Parliament,
but to no purpo&s;e; they could not get in. How|ever,
two Mini&s;ters, (<HI>viz.</HI>) Mr. <HI>Robert Pont,</HI>
and Mr. <HI>Balcanquell,</HI> by their private Intere&s;t,
did get in, and did make a Prote&s;t again&s;t th
Proceedings.</P>
<P>Not content with this Proceeding, the King
and Council &s;ent an Order to the Magi&s;trates of
<HI>Edinburgh,</HI> that in Ca&s;e any Mini&s;ter did, in th
Pulpit, offer to &s;peak any Thing again&s;t the
Proceedings of the Parliament, they &s;hould in|&s;tantly
pull them down from the Pulpit, and
commit them to Pri&s;on; &s;o the Acts were pa&s;t
to de&s;troy the Church, and to erect the Epi&s;copal
Hierarchy in its Room, and were proclaimed at
the Market-Cro&s;s of <HI>Edinburgh:</HI> The &s;aid Mr.
<HI>Pont</HI> and Mr. <HI>Balcanquell</HI> taking In&s;truments of
their Prote&s;t again&s;t it in the Name and Behalf
of the Church. But the &s;aid Mini&s;ters had no
&s;ooner done &s;o, but they were oblig'd to fly,
as did al&s;o Mr. <HI>James Law&s;one,</HI> and &s;everal o|thers.</P>
<P>The&s;e Acts of Parliament, for prote&s;ting a|gain&s;t
which the Mini&s;ters were thus u&s;ed, a|mounted
to neither more nor le&s;s than an Ac|knowledgment
of the King's Supremacy, and
the Government of the Church by Bi&s;hops, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>It has been an Ob&s;ervation, which, I believe,
will hold good throughout all Ages of the
Church &s;ince the Reformation, that no &s;ooner
was Epi&s;copacy, upon any Occa&s;ion, &s;et up in
the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> but it began always to
per&s;ecute the Presbyterian Church. And this
<PB N="105" REF="108">
was the Ca&s;e here; for &s;oon after this the Par|liament
&s;at again, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>28th</HI> of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1584,
when an Act was made, enjoining all Mini&s;ters,
Ma&s;ters of Colleges, and other Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Per|&s;ons,
to appear within 40 Days, and &s;ub&s;cribe
the new Con&s;titution of the Church, as it was
then called, and &s;ubmit to their Dioce&s;an, on
Pain of lo&s;ing their Stipends.</P>
<P>Some Mini&s;ters refu&s;ed this, and were &s;ore|ly
per&s;ecuted by the Council; but they conti|nued
to declare again&s;t it as illegal, and being
que&s;tioned by the Council, how they dur&s;t op|po&s;e
or condemn an Act of Parliament, they an|fwered
boldly, that they would condemn every
Thing that was repugnant to the Word of
God. Mr. <HI>Graig,</HI> one of the&s;e Mini&s;ters, was
greatly in&s;ulted by the Earl of <HI>Arran;</HI> but he an|&s;wered
him in a Kind of prophetick Rage, That
God &s;hould, in a &s;hort Time, ca&s;t him from his
Hor&s;e, meaning his Pride and Power, and humble
him for mocking the Servants of God. This came
<HI>literally</HI> to pa&s;s in a few Years after, the Earl
being unhor&s;t by <HI>Douglas</HI> of <HI>Parkhead,</HI> and kill|ed.</P>
<P>On this Occa&s;ion Mr. <HI>Craig</HI> was depriv'd, and
forbid to preach in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and the Archbi|&s;hop
went up into his Pulpit to preach, by Or|der
of the King and Council; but when the
People &s;aw him come up into the Pulpit, in|&s;tead
of their own Mini&s;ter, they univer&s;ally
ro&s;e up and went out of the Church, the <HI>Court-Party</HI>
only &s;taying in the Place. The Copy of
the Sub&s;cription required of the Mini&s;ters was
as follows.</P>
<P>We the Benefic'd-Men, Mini&s;ters, and Ma&s;ters
of Schools and Colleges, te&s;tifie and promi&s;e by

<HI>Witne&s;s,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;ters that refu&s;ed to &s;ub&s;cribe this
Paper, went into voluntary Bani&s;hment and re|mained
in <HI>England,</HI> but mo&s;tly about <HI>Berwick,</HI>
where the bani&s;hed Lords al&s;o re&s;ided; but they
had their Preaching even there but in private;
for &s;uch was the Corre&s;pondence between the E|pi&s;copal$People in <HI>Scotland</HI> and the Church of
<HI>England,</HI> that albeit the Queen of <HI>England</HI> per|mitted
the bani&s;hed Lords and Mini&s;ters of
<HI>Scotland</HI> to harbour in <HI>England,</HI> yet would &s;he
not admit them to have Preaching in publick,
as not being con&s;onant to the Wor&s;hip of the
Church in <HI>England.</HI> Great In&s;tance was made
to Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> to deliver up tho&s;e Noble|men
and fugitive Mini&s;ters, which never the le&s;s
&s;he would never do; but &s;he yielded at la&s;t to
oblige them to re&s;ide farther from the Borders&punc;</P>
<P>During the&s;e Oppre&s;&s;ions, many Mini&s;ters of
the Kirk complied with and &s;ub&s;crib'd the Form
above, with &s;ome Alterations. Mr. <HI>Andrew
Sim&s;on,</HI> Mini&s;ter of <HI>Dalkeith,</HI> &s;ub&s;cribed thus:</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="110">
I MASTER ANDREW SIMPSON,
Mini&s;ter of <HI>Dalkeith,</HI> &s;wear by the Name of the
great God, that I &s;hall not preach any Here&s;ie or &s;e|ditious
Doctrine, nor &s;hall privately or publickly &s;tir
up the <HI>King's Maje&s;ty's</HI> Subjects to any Rebellion,
and &s;hall obey all his Laws and Acts of Parliament,
&s;o far as they agree with the Word of God.</P>
<P>Others ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed, and Mr. <HI>Dalglie&s;h,</HI>
Mini&s;ter of the <HI>We&s;t Kirk</HI> at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> was one; in|&s;omuch
that a Scaffold was erected for his Executi|ons
which, however, could not bring him off, nei|ther
would he ever comply. At la&s;t the Court was
fain to publi&s;h an Explanation of it, &s;oftening
the Meaning. But tho' this Explanation, which
was penn'd by the Archbi&s;hop, was accepted
with much Applau&s;e in <HI>England,</HI> and the <HI>Scots</HI>
Mini&s;ters were cen&s;ur'd then for rejecting it, yet it
$in'd but very little upon the Mini&s;ters in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
and &s;erv'd only to &s;hew the Weakne&s;s of tho&s;e
Acts which they took &s;o much Pains to explain.
In this Condition &s;tood the Church for &s;ome
Years, &s;truggling with daily Innovations, the
King their open and declared Enemy, and on|ly
&s;upported by the Integrity of her Mini&s;ters
and People: The great Subject upon which the
Mini&s;ters were per&s;ecuted was, the &s;ub&s;cribing
the Obligation mentioned; all &s;uch as refu&s;ed
were di&s;plac'd, and turn'd out; and this con|$inued$
to the Year 1587, when it plea&s;ed
God to give a new Turn to the Affairs of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> of which the following brief Account
will inform us.</P>
<P>The bani&s;hed Lords, who, as has been &s;aid,
the Queen of <HI>England</HI> had been unkind to, were
one <HI>South;</HI> but an Accident happen'd upon
<PB N="108" REF="111">
the Borders, which brought them back; for
on the <HI>26th</HI> of <HI>July</HI> 1585, at a Meeting of the
Wardens of the Borders on either Side, to ad|ju&s;t
&s;ome Di&s;putes, in&s;tead of an Agreement,
they fell to Blows, and the young Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI>
elde&s;t Son to the Earl of <HI>Bedford,</HI> with &s;ome
other <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men were &s;lain by the Laird of
<HI>Fernihur&s;t:</HI> Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> re&s;enting this as a
high Affront, &s;hewed her Re&s;olution to re|venge it;
and immediately, as a Beginning, &s;he
&s;miles upon the Refugee-Lords, and encourages
them with Money and Promi&s;es of A&s;&s;i&s;tance
to return into their Country by a &s;trong Hand:
The Confu&s;ions which then happen'd at Court,
gave them a very good Opportunity, and &s;e|veral
di&s;contented Lords, and &s;ome under Pro|&s;ecutions
for differing Cau&s;es, not Religion,
yet all joined with the&s;e to recover their Liber|ty
by Force, and to lay hold of this Occa&s;ion,
as offered by Heaven for their Return.</P>
<P>About the Beginning of <HI>October,</HI> the bani&s;h|ed
Lords from abroad, and the di&s;contented
Lords at home, meet at <HI>Jedburgh;</HI> and mu&s;ter|ing
their Forces found they had between Nine
and Ten Thou&s;and Men well appointed: The
King and the Earl of <HI>Arran</HI> lay at <HI>Sterling,</HI>
with few Forces; the Lords advance to <HI>Falkirk,</HI>
and the next Day to <HI>Sterling:</HI> The Earl of <HI>Ar|ran,</HI>
the Archbi&s;hop, and all the wicked Crew
fly over <HI>Forth,</HI> pur&s;ued fa&s;ter by their own
Guilt, than by their Enemies; the Ca&s;tle &s;ur|rendred
the <HI>4th</HI> of <HI>November;</HI> and the Lords
pre&s;ent them&s;elves to the King.</P>
<P>And now the hypocritical Face being $word$
outermo&s;t, they are received with Kindne&s;s
and Favour, tho' nothing le&s;s intended or de|&s;ired;
the Epi&s;copal Crew fly while none pur&s;ues,
<PB N="109" REF="112">
the King owns he has been abu&s;ed, pro|mi&s;es
to be directed by their Coun&s;el, and pre|tends
to acknowledge the good Hand of God in
ringing Things to their due Cour&s;e again, and
re&s;toring them, who were his faithful Friends,
without Blood&s;hed.</P>
<P>The Scene being thus chang'd, Epi&s;copacy
$ani&s;h'd in a Moment, as a Vapour before the
Sun; a Parliament was &s;ummoned, and the
Church had its A&s;&s;embly again, which had been
$uppre&s;s'd for near Three Years.</P>
<P>This A&s;&s;embly was appointed for the <HI>23d</HI> of
<HI>November</HI> 1587, and the Place named was <HI>Dum|$ermling,</HI>
the Plague reigning both at <HI>Edinburgh</HI>
and <HI>Sterling;</HI> but when the Mini&s;ters came thi|ther,
they found the Ports of the Town &s;hut
again&s;t them, by Order of the Laird of <HI>Pit|$erren;</HI>
&s;o they adjourn'd to <HI>Linlithgow.</HI></P>
<P>But the King, who mortally hated the Kirk,
began now to work another way; for as he
could not recover the Party that was now ba|$i&s;hed
and fled; he fell to flattering the return|ed
Lords, and by &s;mooth Words, Entreaties,
Promi&s;es, Bribes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to bring them off from
their Engagements with the Mini&s;ters; &s;o that
when the A&s;&s;embly applyed to the King to
$brogate the Acts of Parliament, which were
their pre&s;ent Grievance, the King flew out in
the greate&s;t Rage imaginable, giving them
$word$ and &s;currilous Language, and railing them
out of his Sight.</P>
<P>Having met with this Repul&s;e, they applyed
$o the Lords, but were &s;orely aba&s;h'd when
they found them cold and backward; &s;ome pro|$o&s;ing
Delays, others declining to meddle with
at all, others promi&s;ing fair, but doing no|thing,
and all of them willing to put it off to
<PB N="110" REF="113">
another Occa&s;ion. But the Mini&s;ters be&s;ieging
the King with continually in&s;i&s;ting upon Re|dre&s;s,
he commanded them to exhibit what they
alledg'd again&s;t the Acts of Parliament i$
Writing, this they did at large, with a Sup$
plication to the King to do them Right. A$

<P>The King makes a Declaration, in An&s;wer
to this, explaining the Acts of Parliament, and
ju&s;tifying them in all Points. And thus it &s;eem|ed
to be a Di&s;pute between the Kirk and the
King; for this Declaration is &s;aid to be penn'$
by the King him&s;elf. The King would gra$
no more than this Declaration allow'd, &s;o the
Kirk return'd a Supplication to the King, and
thus it &s;tood for that Year. This Declaration
and Supplication are curious Pieces for those
to read who de&s;ire to be fully Ma&s;ters of this
Di&s;pute, and much has been &s;aid of the ex|traordinary
Nicety and Subtilty of the Compo|&s;ition.

&s;aid <HI>Patrick Adam&s;one,</HI> and ordains the &s;aid Sen|tence
of Excommunication in&s;tantly to be put in
Execution in the Face of the A&s;&s;embly, and by the
Mouth of Mr. <HI>Andrew Huntar,</HI> Mini&s;ter of <HI>Carn|bie,</HI>
declaring him to be one of tho&s;e whom Chri&s;t
commandeth to be holden as an Heathen or Publi|can
&mdash;Ordaining the &s;aid Sentence to be intimated
in all the Kirks, that none pretend Ignorance there|of.</P>
<P>The Archbi&s;hop appealed, and excommuni|cated
&s;everal of the Mini&s;ters; but he was an|&s;wered
by Mr. <HI>James Melvin</HI> at large, and this
is the Sentence which the Bi&s;hop begg'd, at his
Death, to be ab&s;olved from: The&s;e Things
held the World in Su&s;pence till the next A&s;|&s;embly
met, which was in <HI>May</HI> 1585. This
was that famous A&s;&s;embly, called, The <HI>A&s;&s;embly
of Conference;</HI> wherein a Conference was ma|naged
by Commi&s;&s;ioners on both Sides, and an
Accommodation was propo&s;ed. The King in|&s;i&s;ted
upon the Name of Bi&s;hop, the A&s;&s;embly
upon the Power and Office. The A&s;&s;embly
granted the Name, and the King gave up the
Power, and thus the Matter &s;eem'd to be com|promi&s;ed
between them. And it is from this
A&s;&s;embly, that, to this Day, the Epi&s;copal Par|ty
&s;ay, that the Presbyterians did acknowledge
Epi&s;copacy; but if they look into the Particu|lars
of the Bi&s;hop which they allowed, they
will find, that he was to be a Pa&s;tor of a Con|gregation,
and that he was to be &s;ubject to the
A&s;&s;embly, and that he came under &s;everal o|ther
Circum&s;tances, which will very ill &s;upport
that A&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>In this A&s;&s;embly, at the King's Reque&s;t, and
upon the Archbi&s;hop's Submi&s;&s;ion, they took
<PB N="113" REF="116">
off the Excommunication, pronounced at the
Synod of <HI>Fife,</HI> again&s;t the Archbi&s;hop of St.
<HI>Andrews,</HI> and ab&s;olv'd him.</P>
<P>But again&s;t this Ab&s;olution one of the Mi|ni&s;ters,
<HI>viz.</HI> Mr. <HI>Andrew Huntar</HI> by Name, gave
in that memorable Prote&s;tation, which &s;tands
upon Record in the Book of the A&s;&s;embly, and to
which afterwards mo&s;t of the re&s;t of the Mi|ni&s;ters
adhered; <HI>which I have added at the End
of this Part, No.</HI> A.</P>
<P>It was ob&s;erved, that the King wrought
with this A&s;&s;embly by much Policy and Cun|$ning;
He had, by Experience, found that rigid
Methods, Per&s;ecutions, and Pro&s;ecutions would
not an&s;wer, and that the Mini&s;ters became ra|ther
the more <HI>CONSTANT,</HI> or <HI>ob&s;tinate,
as he called it,</HI> by &s;uch Methods; wherefore he
went other ways to work, and &s;eeking by all
&s;ecret and underhand Dealings, to divide and
draw off, to plea&s;e, wheedle, per&s;wade, entreat,
and deceive; by the&s;e Methods he got many of
the Brethren to act a different Part from what
they would otherwi&s;e have done. This was e|vident
in the Ca&s;e of the Archbi&s;hop, where he
formally &s;ubmitted, but &s;ecretly abhorr'd them;
the Church formally ab&s;olv'd him, and yet &s;e|cretly
believ'd him to be unreformed.</P>
<P>However it was, the Church, in all this Time,
kept upon its Feet, tho' in continual Broils
with the King; upon the Subject of Epi&s;copacy,
and as well about the Authority as the Name
of a Bi&s;hop. There were Two A&s;&s;emblies in
the Year 1587, but the latter was convened
extraordinary, becau&s;e of the growing Danger
of Popery; the I&s;land being under great Appre$en&s;ions,
at that Time, from the threatn'd Inva|tion
of the <HI>Spani&s;h Armada;</HI> and during which
<PB N="114" REF="117">
the Di&s;putes at home were &s;omewhat abated;
and it was on this Occa&s;ion, that the Agree|ment,
called the <HI>General Band,</HI> was &s;ub&s;cribed
by the King, Council, and &s;everal Per&s;ons of
divers E&s;tates through the whole Kingdom,
which, in &s;hort, was neither more or le&s;s than
what we now call an A&s;&s;ociation, and was done
again&s;t the Papi&s;ts, in which are the&s;e Words:
&startq;And for our farther hearty Union in this
Service, we are content, and con&s;ent, that
all and what&s;oever our Feuds and Variances,
fallen, or that may fall out between us, be
within 40 Days hereafter, amicably referred
and &s;ubmitted to Seven or Five indifferent
Friends, cho&s;en by his Maje&s;ty, of our whole
Number; and by their Moderation and Ar|bitriment
taken away and componed: And
finally, that we will neither directly or in|directly,
&s;eparate or withdraw us from the
Union or Fellow&s;hip of one another; and as
we &s;hall an&s;wer to God, upon our Con&s;ciences;
and to the World, upon our Truth and Ho|nour,
and under Pain to be e&s;teemed Tray|tors
to God and his Maje&s;ty, and to have
lo&s;t all Honour, Credit, and E&s;timation in
Time coming.&endq;</P>
<P>They were at this Time under Apprehen&s;i|ons,
as is &s;aid, of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Inva&s;ion, and the
next A&s;&s;embly being on the <HI>6th</HI> of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> in
<HI>Edinburgh,</HI> appointed a &s;olemn Fa&s;t upon that
Occa&s;ion. <HI>NOTE, the A&s;&s;embly, not the King
appointed this Fa&s;t.</HI> And at the End of <HI>October,</HI> the
&s;ame Year, a &s;olemn Fa&s;t was kept Three Sab|baths
&s;ucce&s;&s;ively, a Communion celebrated,
and the whole concluded with giving Thanks
for the Defeat of the <HI>Spani&s;h Armada</HI> by the
<HI>Engli&s;h. NOTE, all this was without the King.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="118">
Things now remain'd in a tolerable Quiet,
the Fears of Popi&s;h Powers were over by De|feat
of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> the King intent upon his
Marriage with the Daughter of the King of
<HI>Denmark,</HI> went over Sea to <HI>Copenhagen.</HI> The
next General A&s;&s;embly was at <HI>Edinburgh Au|gu&s;t</HI>
4. 1590, and now the King and the Church
&s;eem'd perfectly <HI>reconciled,</HI> and, which is more,
<HI>united.</HI> Of this A&s;&s;embly I mu&s;t record &s;ome|thing,
the Truth of which is not to be doubt|ed;
but the more it is certain, the greater
Brand of Infamy and Reproach will it leave
behind upon the Per&s;on, who, after this, acted
&s;o contrary, in his Station, to what he appear'd
that Day.</P>
<P>The Eighth Se&s;&s;ion of this A&s;&s;embly the
King came in Per&s;on into the Place where the
Mini&s;ters held their Meeting, and being &s;eat|ed
in a Chair of State, the Moderator Mr.
<HI>Patrick Galloway</HI> propo&s;ed Three Things to him,
<HI>viz.</HI> The Ratification of their Liberties, the
Purging the Land of Je&s;uits, Popi&s;h Seminaries,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the Provi&s;ion of Salaries or Stipends
in every Pari&s;h for the Mini&s;ters. <HI>For the fir&s;t,</HI>
the King an&s;wered, That in every Parliament
their Liberties were ratified, and &s;hould &s;till
be &s;o. That he would, <HI>with Heart and good
Will,</HI> join to do the Second; and <HI>for Stipends,</HI>
he referred them to the Council, and ordered
them to name Commi&s;&s;ioners to treat with the
Council about it: After &s;ome other Debates,
the King &s;tood up, and taking off his Bonnet,
with his Hands and Eyes lifted up to Heaven,
<HI>but hypocritically, &s;ay the Writers of tho&s;e Times,</HI>
he broke out, as it were, in an Exta&s;ie of
Prai&s;es and Thank&s;giving to God, &startq;(1) That
he was born into the World, at a Time when
<PB N="116" REF="119">
the Light of God's Word &s;hone clearly forth,
eclips'd neither with the Mi&s;ts of Ignorance, or
the fal&s;e Lights of Super&s;tition. (2.) He ble&s;|&s;ed
God that had honoured him to <HI>be a King
over S&V;CH A KIRK, the &s;incere&s;t KIRK
in the World,</HI>&endq; &s;ays the King, repeating it
Three Times: To &s;trengthen this he flies out
upon other Prote&s;tants, <HI>The Church of</HI> GENE|VA,
<HI>what are they?</HI> Says the King, <HI>they keep
PASCHE and Y&V;LE, what Authority
have they in God's Word,</HI> &s;ays the King, <HI>and
where is their In&s;titution?</HI> As for our Neigh|bour
Church in <HI>England, &s;ays this mo&s;t &s;incere
and wi&s;e King, whom our</HI> Engli&s;h Church-Men,
<HI>after this, compared to</HI> Solomon <HI>for Wi&s;dom,</HI>
&startq;Their Service is <HI>an EVIL MASS SAID
IN</HI> ENGLISH, they want nothing of the
Ma&s;s but the Liftings: I charge you my good
People, <HI>turning him&s;elf to every Side of the Kirk,</HI>
Mini&s;ters, Doctors, Elders, Nobles, Barons,
and Gentlemen, to &s;tand to your Purity, and
to exhort my People to do the &s;ame, <HI>AND
I,</HI> for&s;ooth, &s;o long as Life and Crown be
left to me, &s;hall maintain the &s;ame again&s;t all
deadly.&endq;</P>
<P>Had he been &s;incere in this, the&s;e Words
were to be recorded to his Honour, but we
&s;hall &s;oon &s;ee his Maje&s;ty acting quite another
Part. However, for the pre&s;ent, the Words,
and above all, the affectionate Manner with
which they were &s;poken, and their coming from
the Mouth of their King, unthought of, un|expected
by the Auditory, &s;o affected the Mini|&s;ters
that many bur&s;t out into Tears for Joy
and Mr. <HI>Calderwood</HI> relating this Pa&s;&s;age &s;ays
<HI>There was nothing heard for a Quarter of $word$
<PB N="117" REF="120">
Hour</HI> in the A&s;&s;embly, <HI>but prai&s;ing God,</HI> and
praying for the King<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Calderwood'<HI>S Hi&s;t. of the Church of</HI> Scotland, <HI>fol.</HI> 256</NOTE>.</P>
<P>While the King continued in this Mood, the
Church gat Ground, and went on in a truly
growing Condition; her Judicatures were ac|knowledg'd,
her Authority e&s;tabli&s;hed, and her
Epi&s;copal Enemies truckled. And I cannot give
a better In&s;tance to confirm this la&s;t, than the
Submi&s;&s;ion and Recantation of the Archbi&s;hop
of St. <HI>Andrews,</HI> the mo&s;t implacable and inve|terate
Enemy of the Church, who had mort|gaged
Faith and Con&s;cience for the Cau&s;e of
Epi&s;copacy, and had made Shipwrack of <HI>BOTH,</HI>
as will appear under his Hand. This Recan|tation
being &s;o eminent, and the Character of
the Man &s;o well known, it is nece&s;&s;ary to re|cord
it with the Hi&s;tory of the Times; becau&s;e
it is a &s;tanding Monument of the Subjection
of the Epi&s;copal Hierarchy to the presbyterial
In&s;titution.</P>
<P>Nor can the Friends of the Church of <HI>Scot|land</HI>
de&s;ire two greater Te&s;timonies to her di|vine
In&s;titution, than the&s;e from the Mouths of
her two greate&s;t Oppo&s;ers, <HI>viz.</HI> the King and
the Archbi&s;hop. The Acknowledgment of E|nemies
has a double Force in it: 'Tis a Con|fe&s;&s;ion
that comes generally extorted by the
Force of Truth, and the Influence of Con&s;ci|ence,
as <HI>Julian</HI> the Apo&s;tate acknowledg'd
Chri&s;t, when the poi&s;oned Dart &s;tuck in his
Fle&s;h. If we may believe the Hi&s;tory of that
Time, the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> had not two
more &s;uch powerful, and perhaps implacable
Enemies in that Age, nay, &s;carcely before o$
<PB N="118" REF="121">
&s;ince, as the King and the Archbi&s;hop, and both
of them are now brought to acknowledge the
Purity of her Doctrine, the Exactne&s;s of her
Di&s;cipline; <HI>the one</HI> to thank God for being born
under &s;uch a &s;incere and heavenly In&s;titution;
<HI>the other,</HI> to cry God and the Church's Mercy
for his apo&s;tatizing from it, and de&s;iring to
die in the Arms of that Church of which be|fore
he had been &s;o cruel a Per&s;ecutor.</P>
<P>But to go on with the Bi&s;hop's Story. He
had been excommunicated by the Synod of <HI>Fife,</HI>
as has been &s;aid; one of his Crimes was Mar|rying
the Marque&s;s of <HI>Huntly,</HI> without requiring
him to &s;ub&s;cribe the Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith, and
after the Presbytery of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> had inhibited
any Mini&s;ter to do it. For this he was pur&s;u|ed
at Law, and &s;tood out to a <HI>Horning,</HI> as it is
there called, (<HI>viz.</HI>) to a Contempt or Execution;
and the King beginning to be weary of the Con|te&s;t,
and willing, perhaps, at that Time to
plea&s;e the A&s;&s;embly, abandon'd him, and depri|ved
him of the Revenue of the Bi&s;hoprick;
whether the&s;e Misfortunes, or the Reproaches
of his own Con&s;cience, brought him down, I
will not determine, Charity bids us judge the
be&s;t. But he fell into a langui&s;hing and grie|vous
Sickne&s;s: In this Condition he acknow|ledges
his Offence again&s;t God and again&s;t the
Mini&s;ters, and &s;ent to them to let them know it,
and to offer him&s;elf to make publick Confe&s;&s;ion
in the Pulpit, to give Satisfaction to all who
had been offended at his Behaviour. He &s;ent
al&s;o to the Presbytery of St. <HI>Andrews,</HI> de&s;iring
they would give him Ab&s;olution, and receive
him again into Communion, and into the Fellow|&s;hip
with the Saints.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="122">
The Mini&s;ters were doubtful of him for a
long Time, they knew not the ju&s;t Rea&s;ons,
however were loth to re&s;i&s;t the Work of Re|pentance,
if begun in Sincerity, and were in|clin'd
to receive him, upon his giving Sati&s;fa|ction
by a publick Acknowledgment, as he pro|po&s;ed;
but it &s;oon appeared there was no
Room for it, his Sickne&s;s being violent and
dangerous: So they directed Two of their Bo|dy
to go to him, and enquire of his Circum|&s;tances,
and make their Report. The&s;e were
Mr. <HI>James Melvin</HI> and Mr. <HI>Andrew Moncrief.</HI>
A&s;&s;oon as the Bi&s;hop &s;aw them enter his Room,
he pull'd off his Cap, and rai&s;ing him&s;elf he
&s;aid, calling them by their Names, <HI>Forgive me,
forgive me, for God's Sake; for I have grievou&s;ly
offended you</HI> in particular. They replied, that
they forgave him, with all their Heart, and
gave him their Hands thereupon; but began to
talk with him about his publick Sins, and to
exhort him to an unfeigned Repentance and
Amendment: This he received with great Af|fection.
Then they proceeded to ask him if he
acknowledged the Validity of the Church's
Cen&s;ure, and of the Excommunication he was
under. He told them <HI>YES, he acknowledg'd
it;</HI> and cried out, <HI>I pray ye loo&s;e me, loo&s;e me,
for Chri&s;t's Sake;</HI> and this he &s;poke with &s;uch
Earne&s;tne&s;s, and with &s;o many Tears, that they
could no longer doubt of his Sincerity, and ha|ving comforted
him as well as they could, they
left him, and making their Report to the re&s;t
of the Mini&s;ters, they met thereupon, and in
a &s;olemn Manner <HI>ab&s;olved</HI> him, giving Thanks
to God who had been plea&s;ed to re&s;tore him
by Conviction and Repentance.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="123">
In <HI>April</HI> following, the Synod of <HI>Fife</HI> meet|ing
at St. <HI>Andrews,</HI> the Bi&s;hop, <HI>(I call him &s;o for
Di&s;tinction,</HI> they called him only Mr. <HI>Patrick A|dam&s;on</HI>)
&s;ent his Recantation in <HI>Latin;</HI> but the
Synod de&s;ired him to cau&s;e it to be drawn again
in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and that he would make it as full
and clear as he could, and &s;et his Hand to it,
which he did, and which is &s;o worthy to be
read with the re&s;t of the Story, that I could
not omit placing it in the Appendix to this Part,
<HI>No.</HI> B. There needs no more to be added of
the Bi&s;hop, &s;ave that about <HI>February,</HI> the Year
following, he died.</P>
<P>At this Time, if ever in this King's Reign,
the Church may be &s;aid to have been in its full
grown Strength; tho' it la&s;ted not long; for
the King having, as was &s;aid, &s;mil'd upon them,
care&s;s'd and complimented them, <HI>tho' it &s;oon ap|peared
that it was no more,</HI> and their <HI>Arch-Ene|my</HI>
having, as above, been reduced, they enjoy|ed
a great Mea&s;ure of Liberty and Authority:
Some few Things indeed were wanting, which
they &s;et forth in their Petitions to the King and
Council in Nine Articles, which, tho' the King
did not immediately grant, yet they had kind
An&s;wers, and &s;o much was done as to make
them &s;omething ea&s;ie. The&s;e Articles were,</P>
<Q><P>1. That all Laws that have been made for
the Weal of the true Kirk be ratified in
Parliament, and a new Act pa&s;s'd, e&s;tabli&s;h|ing
the Juridiction of the Kirk, and all
contrary Laws be aboli&s;hed.</P>
<P>2. That the Kirk and Country be forthwith
purged from Popi&s;h Prie&s;ts and Excommu|nicates.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="124">
3. That a Law be made for repre&s;&s;ing and
puni&s;hing the Abu&s;ers of the Sacraments.</P>
<P>4. That Mini&s;ters be maintained in the Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of their <HI>Glebes, Man&s;es,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>5. That Order be taken with the Author of
the Tumult at the Bridge of <HI>Dee.</HI></P>
<P>6. That Laws be made again&s;t violating the
Sabbath, and di&s;turbing of Mini&s;ters in,
or going about the Execution of their Office.</P>
<P>7. <HI>Ibid.</HI> for repre&s;&s;ing of Rapin and Murther,
that the Land may be purged of Blood.</P>
<P>8. That all Churches be forthwith planted
with Mini&s;ters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and &s;ufficient Stipends
allotted them.</P>
<P>9. That the Lands mortified to the Church, <HI>i.
e. given by decea&s;ed Per&s;ons in their Will,</HI>
with the Re&s;idue of the Tithes, which are
not employed for Mini&s;ter's Stipends, be be|&s;towed
on the Schools, Colleges, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> As
al&s;o for Provi&s;ion for the Poor, and re|pairing the Kirks.</P></Q>
<P>All the&s;e Things the King had promi&s;ed in
general Terms formerly to perform, but it
&s;eems, the Mini&s;ters found not the Effect of
tho&s;e Promi&s;es as they de&s;ired, and therefore
to the &s;aid Articles they added one, which the
King took not well at their Hands, <HI>viz.</HI> That,
in re&s;pect many Things had been promi&s;ed, but
few performed, that now the Manner and
Time of performing &s;hould be expre&s;&s;ed, and the
Execution of every Part agreed to. This Clau&s;e
&s;eemed to reproach the King with evil treat|ing
the Church, which he laid up in his Heart.</P>
<P>And now the Mini&s;ters thought the Time was
come, and an Opportunity pre&s;ented when the
Polity of the Church might be confirm'd, and
<PB N="122" REF="125">
the Book of Di&s;cipline be recognized, and tho'
they fore&s;aw that they would find it very diffi|cult
to bring the King and his great Men to it,
&s;o as to get it enacted in Parliament; they re&s;ol|ved,
however, to give it all the Sanction they
could: The Commi&s;&s;ion of the General A&s;&s;embly
therefore publi&s;hed an Act to &startq;Order and appoint,
<HI>the&s;e are the very Words,</HI> that who&s;oever hath
born Office in the Mini&s;try within this Kirk,
or pre&s;ently bear, or hereafter &s;hall bear Of|fice
therein, do, and &s;hall &s;ub&s;cribe the Heads
of the Di&s;cipline of the Kirk within this
Realm, at length &s;et down and allowed by
Act of the whole A&s;&s;embly, in the Book of
Polity, regi&s;tred in the Regi&s;ter of the Kirk,
and namely in the Heads controverted by the
Enemies of the Di&s;cipline of the reformed
Kirk in this Realm, and that they be charg'd
to do &s;o by every particular Presbytery where
they be re&s;ident; and this, under Pain of Ex|communication,
to be executed again&s;t the
Non-Sub&s;cribers, and the Presbyteries which
&s;hall be negligent, &s;hall receive publick Re|buke
before the whole A&s;&s;embly.&endq;</P>
<P>It is ob&s;erv'd, however, in<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Calderwood'<HI>s Hi&s;t. fol.</HI> 257.</NOTE> Hi&s;tory, that
&s;everal Mini&s;ters in the Church &s;hunned to

and accepted Bi&s;hopricks in the Innovations
which &s;oon after were made by the King upon
the Church.</P>
<P>Nor was this all. But farther to prove what
I have ob&s;erved of the Church's being arrived
to its full grown State, it is to be ob&s;erved,
That the Parliament being now &s;ummoned to
<PB N="123" REF="126">
the <HI>29th</HI> of <HI>May</HI> 1692, the Church obtained,
in that Meeting, a compleat Ratification of

of their General A&s;&s;emblies, Synods, and
Presbyteries, which they had for many Years
before &s;truggled with their Princes and Gover|nours
for, but to no Purpo&s;e. The Tenor of
this valuable, and indeed unexpected Act of
Parliament is too long to in&s;ert at large; but
the principal enacting Clau&s;e is as follows.

<Q>Agreed upon by his Maje&s;ty in Conference had
by his Highne&s;s with certain of the Mini&s;ters
convened to that Effect.</Q>
<P>It was at this Time that the A&s;&s;embly took
that Freedom which they have been &s;o often re|proached
with &s;ince, and which, they &s;aid, King
<PB N="125" REF="128">
<HI>James</HI> never forgave them, (<HI>viz.</HI>) to admoni&s;h
the King. I &s;hall give it impartially in the
Words of their own Hi&s;torians: `The A&s;&s;embly
directed their Brethren who were appoint|ed
to pre&s;ent the Articles (<HI>that is, tho&s;e above
mentioned</HI>) to go immediately to his Maje&s;ty,
and to admoni&s;h him gravely, in the Name
of the eternal God, to have Re&s;pect in Time
to the E&s;tate of true Religion, to the many
Murthers and Oppre&s;&s;ions, daily multiplied,
through Impunity and Lack of Ju&s;tice, and to
di&s;charge the Kingly Office in both, as he
will e&s;chew the fearful Challenge of God,
and avert his Wrath off him&s;elf and the
whole Land, and that he might be the bet|ter
informed, to lay down the Particulars to
him, and crave An&s;wer.</P>
<P>It is true, it was a Freedom which Kings
have not been much acquainted with in this
Age; but the Mini&s;ters of that Age thought it
their Duty, and perhaps if Mini&s;ters had &s;ince
done their Duty, with the &s;ame Care and Con|&s;cience,
tho' their Kings had been ill plea&s;ed,
they had done better for the Publick, and for
Religion al&s;o.</P>
<P>However this was done with dutiful Re|&s;pect,
and when the King complained of the
Freedom, they, for Vindication of their own Be|haviour
to their Prince, cau&s;ed the A&s;&s;embly to
pa&s;s an Act, ordaining, that `No Mini&s;ter with|in
this Realm utter, from the Pulpit, any ra&s;h
or irreverent Speeches again&s;t his Maje&s;ty, or
his Council, or their Proceedings; but that
all their publick Admonitions proceed upon
ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary Cau&s;es, and &s;ufficient War|rant,
in all Fear, Love, and Reverence, under
Pain of depo&s;ing the Offenders. And this
<PB N="126" REF="129">
mo&s;t effectually cleares them from the Charge
of being mutinous and rebllious, and of refu|&s;ing
to &s;ubmit to lawful Authority.</P>
<P>It is worth noting, for the Ob&s;ervation of the
Curious, that this happy Parliament, wherein
the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> was thus e&s;tabli&s;hed, and
her Rights of every Kind recognized, met $word$
that particular Day from which her Overthrow
was 72 Years after dated. I mean at the Re|&s;toration,
<HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>29th</HI> of <HI>May.</HI></P>
<P>The Authority of the Church being in this
flouri&s;hing E&s;tate, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to record, to
their eternal Prai&s;e, as no doubt it is in Hea|ven
to their eternal Comfort, how the Mini&s;ters
made u&s;e of their Time, and how they applied
them&s;elves to di&s;charge the Duty which lay
upon them as a national Church. I &s;hall &s;in|gle
out one or two Examples.</P>
<P>1. They appointed a Vi&s;itation of all the
Presbyteries in the Kingdom, and that the
Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> may be a &s;tanding Example
to all the Prote&s;tant Churches in the World,
I &s;hall give the very Words of the Act of the
A&s;&s;embly, the Meaning and De&s;ign of this Vi|&s;itation
as follows: &startq;Fora&s;much as the Vi&s;iters
of Presbyteries, univer&s;ally throughout the
whole Realm, are thought a Thing very ne|ce&s;&s;ary,
and from diver&s;e A&s;&s;emblies Commi&s;|&s;ion
hath been given for that Effect, a Ne|ce&s;&s;ity
yet remaining, which craveth the con|tinuing of the
&s;aid Commi&s;&s;ion, the A&s;&s;embly
hath given Commi&s;&s;ion to certain Brethren,
to vi&s;it, and try the Doctrine, Life, Conver|&s;ation,
Diligence, and Fidelity of the Pa&s;tors,
within the &s;aid Presbyteries: And &s;iclike to
try, if there be any of the beneficed Number
within the famine, not making Re&s;idence, ha|ving
<PB N="127" REF="130">
no rea&s;onable Excu&s;e: If there be any
that have dilapidate their Benefices, &s;et Tacks
and made other Di&s;po&s;itions of the &s;ame,
without the Con&s;ent of the General A&s;&s;embly;
any &s;landerous Per&s;on, unmeet to &s;erve in the
Kirk of God, unable and unqualified to teach
and edifie: And with Advice of the Presbyte|ry,
within the which the &s;aid Per&s;ons remain,
to proceed again&s;t them, according to the
Quality of the Offence, according to the Acts
of the Kirk.&endq;</P>
<P>2. The Synod of <HI>Fife</HI> being met at St. <HI>An|drews
September</HI> 25. 1593, and being informed
of the Threatnings, the In&s;olence, and the
growing Power of Papi&s;ts and other Enemies
of the Truth, and how the Impunity in &s;uffer|ing
the&s;e Things to go unpuni&s;hed, was a great
and a national Sin, moved with this and other
Signs of imminent Danger, made the following
Conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>That the Pa&s;tors of every Congregation, being fir&s;t
$repared them&s;elves, by Ab&s;tinence, Prayer, and
diligent Study, and Attendance upon their Charge,
$ravel carefully by their Doctrine and good Example
to move and di&s;po&s;e the Hearts of their Flock to
$nfeigned Repentance, calling for Mercy and Pre|$ervation
at the Hands of God, that thus both
Pastor and People may be prepared again&s;t that
general and &s;olemn Fa&s;t which the Synod thinketh
mo&s;t needful to be publi&s;hed throughout the Realm.
The Cau&s;es whereof, be&s;ide the general Rea&s;ons for
Humiliation in Time pa&s;t, are as follows.</P>
<P>The Cau&s;es which are here referred to were
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Calderwood, <HI>fol.</HI> 289.</NOTE> &s;ummed up in many Particulars, referring
<PB N="128" REF="131">
chiefly to the Growth of Popery, Idolatry,
Prophanene&s;s, and Immorality.</P>
<P>To this the &s;aid A&s;&s;embly added the direct|ing
&s;ome of their Members to the King &startq;To
tell plainly to his Maje&s;ty, <HI>the&s;e be al&s;o their
own Words,</HI> that which all his true Subjects
think, touching his too much bearing with,
favouring and countenancing Papi&s;ts and
Traytors, his Negligence in repre&s;&s;ing Ido|latry,
and e&s;tabli&s;hing the Kingdom of Chri&s;t
within his Realm, and to declare freely to
his Maje&s;ty the Re&s;olution of all his godly
and faithful Subjects, <HI>viz.</HI> That they are rea|dy
to give their Lives, rather than to &s;uffer
the &s;ame.&endq;</P>
<P>This was plain dealing, and this was what
the Courtiers afterwards called di&s;ciplining of
the King. But the Synod &s;topt not here; for
they went on to excommunicate the Popi&s;h and
<HI>Spani&s;hly</HI> affected Nobility, &s;o they then called
them, as Per&s;ons &startq;Who, by their Idolatry,
Her&s;ie, Bla&s;phemy, Apo&s;tacy, Perjury, and
profe&s;&s;ed Enmity to the Kirk and true Re|ligion,
had, <HI>ip&s;o, facto,</HI> cut them&s;elves off from
Chri&s;t and his Church.&endq; This Excommunica|tion
by the Synod is regi&s;tred at large in the
Acts of the Church, having been afterwards
approv'd by the A&s;&s;embly. But the King took
great Di&s;ta&s;te at it, and from hence forward be|gan
to withdraw his Countenance, and A&s;&s;i|&s;tance,
and Favour from the Church, as &s;oon
appeared in the Con&s;equences; for the Church
pur&s;ued the excommunicated Lords, the King
protected them: The Church de&s;ired the King
to give them no Acce&s;s to his per&s;on, the
King openly received them at <HI>Jedburgh,</HI> and the
like.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="132">
Upon this a Meeting, or Convention of Mi|ni&s;ters,
Commi&s;&s;ioners of Buroughs, and Barons
met at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and deputed &s;ome of their
Members to wait upon the King. The King
refu&s;ed to admit them, and &s;ent them Word
$word$ did not acknowledge their Convention, it
$eing without his Advice. They in&s;i&s;ted upon
$he Legality of their Meeting. At la&s;t <HI>the King
ielded</HI> and gave &s;uch An&s;wers as he thought
it to their Advices, but with little Satisfaction,
$nd perhaps as little Sincerity. However, the
$xcommunicated Lords offered them&s;elves to
$ryal the King agreed to it, giving a
Commi&s;&s;ion for that Purpo&s;e to a certain Num|ber
of the Peers and Gentlemen to try them:
Their Names were as follows, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the Earls
<HI>of Huntly, Angus, Errol,</HI> Laird of <HI>Auchindown,</HI>
$nd Sir <HI>James Chi&s;holme.</HI> But the King abo|$$&s;hed
the whole Proce&s;s afterwards, and by
his own Royal Declaration ab&s;olved them all,
$word$ that upon Conditions not at all acceptable
$word$ the General A&s;&s;embly, who, being met at
Edinburgh <HI>May</HI> 7, 1594, ratified the Excom|$unication
again&s;t the Lords, ordered it to be
$ronounced in every Church in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and
reputed a Committee of their Mini&s;ters to lay
Repre&s;entation of the DANGERS OF
THE CH&V;RCH, (mark it is an old Phra&s;e)
$efore the King, and report his An&s;wer. The
$epre&s;entation was very long, and the King's
$n&s;wer particular; but in &s;hort, the King pro$i&s;ed
to forefault the excommunicated Lords;
$hat is, to <HI>outlaw</HI> them, and that the Parliament
$ould meet according to the Time appointed:
$word$ which was made good, and the excommuni|$$ted
Lords were declared guilty of High
rea&s;on, their Coat&s; of Arms torn by the He|rald,
<PB N="130" REF="133">
and their E&s;tates forfeited: Upon which
they broke out into open Rebellion, and there|upon
followed the Battle of <HI>Balrinne&s;s,</HI> between
the Earl of <HI>Argyle,</HI> and the Earls of <HI>Huntly</HI> and
<HI>Errol,</HI> wherein the excommunicated Lords were
defeated. But that is not to our Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Having often quoted Mr. <HI>Calderwood</HI>'s Hi&s;to|ry
to the Matters of Fact here related, I &s;hall
now give the Words of that ancient and grave
Hi&s;torian to the Subject I am upon, confirm|ing
what I have &s;aid of the full grown State
of the Church; And I do it here, becau&s;e that
State &s;eem'd now to be at its Hight, and that
this was the Time from whence it began &s;en|&s;ible
to decline; for now the Church fell into
Difficulties and Strife, which eclips'd her$
Glory for many Years, from whence, however,
we &s;hall &s;ee her quickly ri&s;ing again with $word$
double Splendor. Mr. <HI>Calderwood</HI>'s Ob&s;ervation$
is this:</P>
<P>&startq;This Year is a remarkable Year to the
Kirk of <HI>Scotland,</HI> both for the Beginning, and
for the End of it. This Kirk was now come
to the greate&s;t Purity that ever it attained
unto; &s;o that her Beauty was admirable to
Foreign Kirks. But the Devil envying the
Happine&s;s, and laudable Proceedings of the
Mini&s;try, and A&s;&s;emblies of the Kirk, &s;tirred
up both Papi&s;ts and Politicians to di&s;turb her
Peace. The Papi&s;ts perceived there was no
Re&s;t for them in <HI>Scotland,</HI> if the Authority
of the Kirk continued; the Politicians feared
that their Craft and Trade, which is to $word$
indifferently all Men and Means to attain to
their own Ends, and to &s;et them&s;elves up
$$as it were, in the Throne of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> &s;hould be
undone. Whereas at her earne&s;t De&s;ire, $word$
<PB N="131" REF="134">
Apo&s;tate Earls <HI>Angus, Huntly,</HI> and <HI>Errol</HI> were
forefaulted for an unnatural and trea&s;onable
Con&s;piracy with the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and were ex|pelled
out of the Country; and &s;he was now
&s;etting her &s;elf to reform what&s;oever Abu&s;es
and Corruptions were perceived in her Mem|bers,
and again&s;t the Re-entry and Re&s;taura|ration
of the &s;aid Earls. But was forced, by
Craft and Policy of Politicians, and di&s;&s;embled
Papi&s;ts, to take her &s;elf to the Defence of her
own Liberties, and of that holy Di&s;cipline,
which was her Bulwark, and to de&s;i&s;t from
farther Oppo&s;ition to the Re-entry of the ex|communicate
Earls. For &s;ome thorny Que|&s;tions,
in Points of Di&s;cipline, were devi&s;ed,
whereby her Authority was in many Points
called in doubt. Mini&s;ters were called before
the Council, to give account of their Rebukes
in Sermons, and to underly their Cen&s;ure.
The Mini&s;ters of the Kirk of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> were
forced to lurk, and that Kirk, which was a
Watch-Tower, and &s;hined as a Lamp to the
re&s;t, was darkned, and no le&s;s Danger ap|peared
to threaten the re&s;t. In a Word, in
the End of this Year began a fearful Decay,
and Declining of this Kirk.&endq;</P>
<P>To confirm this, we &s;hall give a Summary,
and that a very brief one, of the Tran&s;actions
on the few Years next following, in which the
Mini&s;ters &s;truggled with the Defections of the
$imes, the refractory Di&s;po&s;ition of their
$rince, and the growing In&s;olence of Courti|$s
and Enemies, till they were cru&s;h'd, and
$rc'd to &s;ubmit to the plea&s;ure of him, who
$ought fit, at that Time, to bring them under
$word$ Feet of their Enemies for a Sea&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="135">
The next A&s;&s;embly met the <HI>25th</HI> of <HI>March</HI>
1596; the King him&s;elf came thither; It &s;eems
it was to de&s;ire the Mini&s;ters to forward a
Loan of Money, which he had de&s;igned to pro|po|&s;e
to the whole Kingdom, on the extraordi|nary
Occa&s;ions which were then before him
The Mini&s;ters declined it, alledging, that the
forfeited E&s;tates of the Rebels were to have
been applied to that U&s;e, it being ju&s;t that
tho&s;e who had been the Occa&s;ion of his extra|ordinary
Expence, &s;hould contribute to defray
the Charge of it.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;ters fell to complaining of his Con|duct,
his per&s;onal Sins, and the Sins of tho&s;e
in his Family, which it was his Duty to re|&s;train.
The King an&s;wered, if there were a|ny
gro&s;s Faults in him, or his Hou&s;e, he would
not decline the Judgment of the A&s;&s;embly, pro|vided
it was done privately. Old <HI>Andrew
Melvin</HI> an&s;wered bluntly, <HI>They could not ju&s;tifie
private Rebuke for open Offences,</HI> and &s;peaking to
the Moderator, charged him, as he would an|&s;wer
it to God, that he &s;hould now do his Du|ty,
and &s;peak to the King plainly and freely,
as was his Place to do. The King &s;tood &s;ilent
a while, and then withdrew.</P>
<P>This A&s;&s;embly was famous for Three Things.
<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> for their Search into and Regulation of
their own Corruptions as Mini&s;ters, extending
to all the Mini&s;ters of the Church; which Re|gulation
con&s;i&s;ts of Eight Heads, and are to be
&s;een in the Regi&s;ters of the Church. And <HI>Se|condly,</HI>
For that famous Humliation and &s;o|lemn
renewing of the <HI>Covenant,</HI> which was be|gun
in the A&s;&s;embly the <HI>30th</HI> of <HI>March</HI> 1596,
and was carried on through all the Mini&s;ters
of <HI>Scotland.</HI> And <HI>Thirdly,</HI> For their humble,
<PB N="133" REF="136">
but faithful Repre&s;entation to the King of the
Sins, as well of his Per&s;on and Family, as of
this Council and Nobility, and the Remedies
thereof, which were exhibited in Five Arti|cles,
and it mu&s;t be own'd this was the la&s;t
Time he had the Ble&s;&s;ing of a faithful Mini|&s;try
to advi&s;e and exhort him; and this A&s;|&s;embly
being over, it was ob&s;erved by many,
that the Church never had another like it, du|ring
that King's Reign, and it is at this Peri|$$d
that Mr. <HI>Calderwood</HI> places in capital Let|ters
the&s;e Words:</P>
<P><HI>Here end the &s;incere General A&s;&s;emblies of the
Kirk of</HI> Scotland.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;ters of this A&s;&s;embly went on with
renewing the Covenant in all the Presbyteries,
and at la&s;t in Pari&s;hes; but when it came to
particular Per&s;ons, and e&s;pecially to the Court,
or to tho&s;e who lived near the Court, <HI>viz,</HI> in
Edinburgh in particular, they declined it, and it
began gradually to drop and be omitted: What
followed we &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee.</P>
<P>The excommunicate Lords were not with|out
their Friends at Court; the King had
been prevailed with to con&s;ent to their Return,
but was not willing to take it upon him&s;elf
for fear of embroiling him&s;elf with the Church,
Whom he feared as well as hated. It was con|certed
therefore to &s;ummon a Parliament, or
Convention of E&s;tates to meet at <HI>Falkland,</HI> and
to get &s;uch e&s;pecially to this Convention as
were in the &s;ecret. At the opening the Se&s;&s;ion
a Motion was made by <HI>Alex. Seatoun,</HI> Brother
to the Lord <HI>Seatoun,</HI> to recal the Lords; it was &s;e|conded
by &s;everal others, u&s;ing &s;ome Threat|nings,
<PB N="134" REF="137">
as if it would be be&s;t to do &s;o, lea&s;t
they &s;hould join with the Enemies of their
Country.</P>
<P>To carry on the Point, &s;everal Mini&s;ters had
Notice given them to be there; but it was
only &s;uch as they thought might be ea&s;ie&s;t
brought to comply. But Mr. <HI>Andrew Melvin,</HI>
a famous and mo&s;t faithful Champion of the
Reformation, went un&s;ent for. It &s;eems he was
appointed or commi&s;&s;ioned by the la&s;t A&s;&s;em|bly
to watch again&s;t the imminent Dangers
that might threaten the Church: And this was
his Authority.</P>
<P>When the Mini&s;ters were called in, he ap|pear'd
at the Head of them: The King taking
Notice of it, ask'd <HI>Who &s;ent for him?</HI> He an|&s;wered,
<HI>SIR, I have a Call to come here from
Chri&s;t and his Church, who have a &s;pecial Concern$
on what you are doing here, and in direct Oppo&s;iti|on
to whom you are all here a&s;&s;embled; but be ye
a&s;&s;ured that no Council taken again&s;t him &s;hall pro&s;|per.
And I charge you, Sir, in his Name, that
you or your E&s;tates, here conveened, favour not
God's Enemies whom he hateth.</HI> After he had
&s;aid this, and more to the like Purpo&s;e to the
King, he turn'd his Speech to the Members of
the Convention, and &startq;Challeng'd them with
being a&s;&s;embled there with a traiterous De|&s;ign
again&s;t Chri&s;t and his Church, and their
native Country:&endq; And was going on when the
King interrupted him, and commanded him to
withdraw, which he did; but &s;oon let the
King hear of him again upon the following Oc|ca&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ion of the <HI>la&s;t A&s;&s;embly</HI> was &s;it|ting
at that Time, and finding which Way
Things were going, they re&s;olved to &s;end &s;ome
<PB N="135" REF="138">
of their Members to the King, to expo&s;tulate
this Matter with him: Of the&s;e the &s;ame Mr.
<HI>Andrew Melvin</HI> was one. When they came to
the King, who received them in his Clo&s;et,
Mr. <HI>James Melvin,</HI> being fir&s;t in the Commi&s;&s;i|on,
&s;poke as the Mouth of the re&s;t, and told the
King their Errand from <HI>the Commi&s;&s;ion.</HI> The
King took him up roundly, and charg'd the
Commi&s;&s;ion with Sedition, and the Mini&s;ters
with being Spreaders of &s;editious Reports, a|larming
the People with imaginary Dangers,
and creating needle&s;s and unju&s;ft Fears. Mr.
<HI>James</HI> being a courteous, fair &s;poken Man, be|gan
to an&s;wer the King with Re&s;pect and with
great Reverence, when Mr. <HI>Andrew,</HI> taking the
Words out of his Mouth, &s;ays he, &startq;Man, this
is not a Time to flatter, but to &s;peak plain|ly;
for, &s;ays he, our Commi&s;&s;ion is from the
mighty God, to whom the King is but <HI>a &s;illy
Va&s;&s;al.</HI>&endq; Then taking the King by the Sleeve,
he tells him, <HI>Sir,</HI> we will humbly reverence your
Maje&s;ty always, namely in publick; but we have this
Occa&s;ion to be with your Maje&s;ty in private, and
you are brought in extream Danger, both of your
Life, and of your Grown, and with you the Country
and Kirk of God is like to be wracked, for not
telling the Truth, and giving you a faithful Coun&s;el:
We mu&s;t di&s;charge our Duty, or el&s;e be Enemies to
Chri&s;t and you. Therefore, Sir, as diver&s;e Times
before, &s;o now I mu&s;t tell you, that there are two
Kings, and two Kingdoms. There is Chri&s;t and his
Kingdom the Kirk, who&s;e Subject King <HI>James</HI> the
Sixth is, and of who&s;e Kingdom he is not a King,
nor a Head, nor a Lord, but a Member; and they,
whom Chri&s;t hath called, and commanded to watch
over his Kirk, and govern his &s;piritual Kingdom,
have &s;ufficient Authority and Power from him &s;o
<PB N="136" REF="139">
to do; which no Chri&s;tian King nor Prince &s;hould
control nor di&s;charge, but fortifie and a&s;&s;i&s;t; other|wi&s;e
they are not faithful Subjects to Chri&s;t. Sir,
when you were in your &s;waddling Clouts, Chri&s;t
reigned freely in this Land, in Spight of all his
Enemies. His Officers and Mini&s;ters conveened and
a&s;&s;embled for ruling of his Kirk, which was ever for
your Welfare al&s;o, when the &s;ame Enemies were
&s;eeking your De&s;truction; and have been, by their
A&s;&s;emblies and Meetings &s;ince, terrible to the&s;e E|nemies,
and mo&s;t &s;teedable for your; will you now,
when there is more than Nece&s;&s;ity, challenge Chri&s;t's
Servants, your be&s;t and mo&s;t faithful Subjects, for
their conveening, and for the Care they have of their
Duty to Chri&s;t and you; whenas you &s;hould rather
commend and countenance them, as the godly Kings
and Emperors did. The Wi&s;dom of your Coun|&s;el,
which is devili&s;h and pernicious, is this, that
you may be &s;erved with all Sorts of Men to come to
your Purpo&s;e and Grandour, Jew and Gentile, Pa|pi&s;t
and Prote&s;tant. Becau&s;e the Mini&s;ters and
Prote&s;tants in <HI>Scotland</HI> are too &s;trong, and con|trol
the King, they mu&s;t be weakened and brought
low, by &s;tirring up a Party again&s;t them, and the
King being equal and indifferent, both &s;hall be fain
to flee to him: So &s;hall he be well &s;ettled. But, Sir,
let God's Wi&s;dom be the only true Wi&s;dom, this
will prove meer and mad Folly: For his Cur&s;e can|not
but light upon it; &s;o that in &s;eeking both, you
&s;hall lo&s;e both: Whereas in cleaving uprightly to
God, his true Servants &s;hall be your true Friends,
and he &s;hall compel the re&s;t counterfeitly and lyingly
to &s;erve you, as he did to <HI>David.</HI></P>
<P>It is ea&s;ie to gue&s;s how well this plea&s;ed the
King: However, tho' the King was at fir&s;t ve|ry
warm and angry, yet he grew calm and
plea&s;ant; prote&s;ted that he had no Knowledge
<PB N="137" REF="140">
of the Return of the Lords, and that offer
what they would, they &s;hould have no Favour
from him; till they had fully &s;atisfied the Church.
This Di&s;cour&s;e of Mr. <HI>Melvin</HI> to the King, Mr.
<HI>Calderwood</HI> &s;ays was taken out of his own Memoirs,
left behind him, written with his own Hand.</P>
<P><HI>The King kept ill his Promi&s;es in this Ca&s;e al&s;o;</HI>
for now Di&s;&s;atisfactions grew high between
the King and the Mini&s;ters; the King encroach|ing
daily upon their Liberties, which they, by
no Means, would give up, they deputed Four
of their Body to the King, to repre&s;ent, that
there was a mo&s;t dangerous Jealou&s;ie begun be|tween
him and the Church, which could not
but he fatal to both, and to de&s;ire his Maje&s;ty
to declare plainly what offended him, that, if
po&s;&s;ible, they might give him Sati&s;faction.</P>
<P>The King an&s;wered in few Words, `That
therecould be no Agreement between him and
them till the <HI>Marches</HI> of their <HI>Juri&s;diction</HI> were
ridden.' This is a <HI>Scotici&s;m</HI> in Speech, alluding
to the People, who u&s;ed to ride annually over the
Marches or Borders of both Kingdoms of <HI>En|gland</HI>
and <HI>Scotland,</HI> to &s;ettle and a&s;certain the
Bounds, as our Pari&s;hed-Officers do annually in
<HI>England</HI> for the Pari&s;hes. This intimated plainly
that the King re&s;olved to put Limits to the
Church's Power, and to re&s;train them in &s;ome
of tho&s;e Liberties and Privileges which they
claimed as their due. When the King had gi|ven
them this Hint, he gave al&s;o Four Heads
of Complaint again&s;t them, in which, he &s;aid,
he expected Redre&s;s.</P>
<Q><P>1. That in their Preaching, they &s;hould
have nothing to do to &s;peak of the King's
Affairs, or of Matters of State.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="141">
2. That the General A&s;&s;embly &s;hould not
meet but by the King's Authority and
e&s;pecial Command.</P>
<P>3. That he have a negative Voice in the
A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>4. That the Church Judicatories meddle
not with Civil Matters, or with any
Matter of Law.</P></Q>
<P>The Mini&s;ters now began to &s;ee plainly, that
the Platform was laid for the Overthrow of
the Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Con&s;titution: They thought it
was a good Providence to the Church that the
King &s;poke &s;o directly to his own De&s;igns, and
they acted with the greate&s;t Prudence and Cau|tion
po&s;&s;ible to take from him all Occa&s;ion of
Advantage over them. They ordered therefore
(1.) That all the Acts of Parliament, Acts of
Council, Declarations of the King, or other
Documents in Favour of the Liberties and Di&s;|cipline
of the Church &s;hould be &s;earch'd out,
and collected. (2.) That the Presbyteries &s;hould
be adverti&s;ed not to enter into any Debates or
Di&s;putes upon the King's Propo&s;al, that they
might not be &s;uppo&s;ed to call in Que&s;tion the
undoubted Liberties and Authority of the
Church. But <HI>he that has a Nail to drive, will
not want a Hammer:</HI> The King had an ill Turn
ready for the Church, and he let them know
it on the following Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>One Mr. <HI>David Black,</HI> a Mini&s;ter in St. <HI>An|drews,</HI>
had u&s;ed &s;ome di&s;ta&s;tful Speeches in a
Sermon &s;ome Months before, which having
given Offence to the King and Council, they re|&s;olved
to begin there, and &s;ummoned him to
appear before the Council to an&s;wer the &s;ame.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="142">
Thus the King began with them, and they,
on the contrary, found him Work enough; for
in the fir&s;t Place; they went on in their judicial
Proce&s;s again&s;t the two great Women, who&s;e
Cau&s;e the King had openly e&s;pou&s;ed, <HI>viz.</HI> the
Lady <HI>Huntly,</HI> and the Lady <HI>Leving&s;tone.</HI> To
the fir&s;t they directed a Libel or Summons to
an&s;wer their Charge: This was, if po&s;&s;ible, to
prevent her being received at Court, as &s;he
could not well be, while under the Proce&s;s of
the Church, before &s;he had given Satisfaction.
2. They ordered the Presbytery of <HI>Sterling</HI> to
proceed to Excommunication again&s;t the Lady
<HI>Leving&s;ton.</HI> And as to Mr. <HI>David Black,</HI> they
ordered that he &s;hould decline the Judicatory of
the King and Council, <HI>or as we call it in</HI> England,
plead to their Juri&s;diction, and refu&s;e to an|&s;wer
before them. Then they came to a Re|&s;olution
in the A&s;&s;embly, <HI>nemine contradicente,</HI>
That all Judgment of Doctrine appertaineth to
the Pa&s;tors of the Church <HI>in prim&acirc; in&s;tanti&acirc;:</HI>
and they appointed a Committee, and farther
ordered all the Mini&s;ters to &s;earch all the War|rants
of Scripture, or Precedents in the Laws
of the Realm, to &s;upport that Po&s;ition.</P>
<P>It would &s;well the&s;e Memoirs too much, to
give a Particular of all the Di&s;putes which
pa&s;s'd between the King and the A&s;&s;embly of
Mini&s;ters on this Occa&s;ion: They waited on him
with their other Demands, and got tolerable
An&s;wers, tho' the King was highly affronted
with Mr. <HI>Patrick Galloway,</HI> one of tho&s;e that was
&s;ent to him, who told him, <HI>That their Enemies
got Grants and Performance; but the Church got
fair Words and Promi&s;es only.</HI> However the King,
upon a new Application, promi&s;ed them po&s;i|tively,
that all they de&s;ir'd &s;hould be granted
<PB N="140" REF="143">
with Re&s;pect to the Popi&s;h Lords and the two
Ladies abovenamed: But there was yet a Sting
in the Tail, about Mr. <HI>David Black,</HI> of whom the
King &s;aid he mu&s;t appear and an&s;wer for him|&s;elf,
to &s;atisfie the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, who, it
&s;eems, had complained again&s;t him, and <HI>take
heed,</HI> &s;ays the King, <HI>that you decline not my Judi|catory,
for if you do, it will be wor&s;e than you
imagine.</HI></P>
<P>Hereupon the A&s;&s;embly went upon it openly,
re&s;olving not to give up their Rights, and direct|ed
Mr. <HI>Black</HI> to give in a Writing of Declina|ture
under his Hand, which, as it is a very cu|rious
Piece, and of great Con&s;equence in the
Que&s;tion, and being penn'd with much Art, as
well as maintained with much Vigor, I cannot

<P>&startq;UNTO your Maje&s;ty and Lords of &s;ecret

by me in &s;ome of my Sermons made in

<PB N="141" REF="144">
Wherein albeit the Con&s;cience of my innocen|cy
upholdeth me &s;uffciently, again&s;t what&s;o|ever
Calumnies of Men; and that I am ready
by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Grace of my God, to
give a Confe&s;&s;ion, and &s;tand to the Defence of
every Point of the Truth of my God, uttered
by me in the &s;aid Sermons, either in opening
up of his Word, or Application thereof, be|fore
your Maje&s;ty or Council, or what&s;omever
per&s;on or Per&s;ons, that upon any lawful Cau&s;e,
will crave an Account of that Hope which is
in me, in what&s;omever Place or Manner, &s;o
far as &s;hall be requi&s;ite for clearing and Main|tenance
of the Truth, and of my Mini&s;try, and
may be done without the Prejudice of that
Liberty, which the Lord Je&s;us hath given and
e&s;tabl&s;ed in the &s;piritual Office-Bearers of
his Kingdom. Yet &s;eeing I am at this Time
brought to &s;tand before his Maje&s;ty and Coun|cil,
as a Judge &s;et to cogno&s;ce, and decern
upon my Doctrine, where through my an&s;wering
to the &s;aid pretended Accu&s;ation might
import, with the manife&s;t prejudice of the
Liberties of the Kirk, an Acknowledgment of
your Maje&s;ty's Juri&s;diction, in Matters that are
meer &s;piritual, which might move your Ma|je&s;ty
to attempt farther in the &s;piritual Go|vernment
of the Hou&s;e of God, to the Provo|cation
of his hot Di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t your Ma|je&s;ty,
and in End either a plain &s;ubverting of
the &s;piritual Judicature, or at lea&s;t a confound|ing
thereof with the Civil, if at any time pro|fane
and ambitious Magi&s;trates might by &s;uch
dangerous Beginnings find the Hedge broken
down to make a violent Irruption upon the
Lord's Inheritance, which the Lord forbid.
Therefore I am con&s;trained, in all Humility
<PB N="142" REF="145">
and Submi&s;&s;ion of Mind, to u&s;e a Declinature
of this Judgment, at lea&s;t <HI>in prima in&s;tantia;</HI>
which I be&s;eech your Maje&s;ty to con&s;ider ear|ne&s;tly,
and accept of, according to Ju&s;tice, for
the Rea&s;ons following.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The Lord Je&s;us, the God of Order, and not
of Confu&s;ion, as appareth evidently in all the
Churches of the Saints, of whom only I have
the Grace of my Calling, as his Amba&s;&s;ador,
albeit mo&s;t unworthy of that Honour, to bear
his Name among his Saints, hath given me his
Word, and no Law or Tradition of Man, as
the only In&s;tructions, whereby I &s;hould rule the
whole Actions of my calling, in Preaching of
the Word, Administration of the Seals there|of,
and Exerci&s;e of Di&s;cipline: And in the Di&s;|charge
of this Commi&s;&s;ion I cannot fall in Re|verence
of any Civil Law of Man, but in &s;o
far as I &s;hall be found to have pa&s;&s;ed the Com|pa&s;s
of my In&s;tructions, which cannot be judg|ed,
according to the Order e&s;tabli&s;hed by that
God of Order, but by the Prophets, who&s;e Lips
he hath appointed to be Keepers of his hea|venly
Wi&s;dom, and to whom he has &s;ubjected
the Spirits of the Prophets. And now &s;eeing
it is the Preaching of the Word, whereupon I
am accu&s;ed, which is a principal Point of my
Calling, of Nece&s;&s;ity the Prophets mu&s;t fir&s;t
declare, whether I have keeped the Bounds of
my Directions, before I come to be judged of
your Maje&s;ty's Laws, for My Offence.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Becau&s;e the Liberty of the Kirk, and whole
Di&s;cipline thereof, according as the &s;ame has
been, and is pre&s;ently, exerci&s;ed within your
Maje&s;ty's Realm, has been confirmed by diver&s;e
Acts of Parliament, and approved by the Con|fe&s;&s;ion
of Faith, by the Sub&s;cription and Oath
<PB N="143" REF="146">
of your Maje&s;ty and Maje&s;ty's E&s;tates, and
whole Body of the Country, and peaceably
enjoyed by the Officebearers of the Kirk in all
Points; and namely in the fore&s;aid Point,
touching the Judgment of the preaching of
the Word <HI>in prima in&s;tantia,</HI> as the Practice of
diver&s;e late Examples evidently will &s;hew.
Therefore the Que&s;tion touching my Preach|ing
ought fir&s;t, according to the Grounds and
Practice fore&s;aid, be judged by the Eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal
Senate, as the competent Judge thereof, in
the fir&s;t In&s;tance.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;In Re&s;pect whereof, and for diver&s;e other
weighty Cau&s;es and Con&s;iderations, namely
of e&s;chewing the great and dangerous Incon|veniences,
that might fall both to Religion
and to your Maje&s;ty's own E&s;tate, by the Ap|pearance
of Di&s;traction of your Maje&s;ty's Af|fection
from the Mini&s;try, and good Cau&s;e of
God in their Hands, to the Grief of your Ma|je&s;ty's
be&s;t Subjects, and to the Encouragement
of the Adver&s;aries, both of your Maje&s;ty's
E|&s;tate and Religion. Therefore I mo&s;t humbly
be&s;eech your Maje&s;ty, and in the Name of
my Brethren the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the General
A&s;&s;embly, and the Remnant of the Brethren
of the Mini&s;try, who, for te&s;tifying their ear|ne&s;t
Affection and Allowance of the Premi&s;&s;es,
have &s;ub&s;cribed the&s;e Pre&s;ents with their
Hands, that your Maje&s;ty in this Action,
would manife&s;t your earne&s;t Care to maintain
that Liberty, which the Church of Chri&s;t
within the Country, for the Comfort of the
Saints, hath with &s;o great Ble&s;&s;ing enjoyed,
&s;ince the Go&s;pel was fir&s;t revealed in this
Land, wherethrough the Godly may be com|forted,
the Adver&s;aries fru&s;trated of their Ex|pectation,
<PB N="144" REF="147">
and your Maje&s;ty truly honoured
in honouring the Lord Je&s;us.&endq;</P>
<P>The Foundation of Di&s;content being thus
laid on both Sides, all Things tended to an
open Rupture between the Parties: The King
at the Head of the Civil Power, and the A&s;|&s;embly
at the Head of the Eccle&s;ia&s;tick, pu&s;h'd
at one another without any Appearance of a
Reconciliation. It is, without doubt, that the
King was Aggre&s;&s;or: He found the Severity of
the Mini&s;ters a Burthen that he could by no
Means bear. They &s;aid the &s;ame of his Inva&s;ions
upon their Liberties. Several Propo&s;als of Ac|commodation
were made, and &s;ometimes they
came very near to one another, nay, at one Time
the King was brought to agree to the Mediums
they propo&s;ed, but the next Morning they found
his Mind quite altered again, and if it be true
which one of the Writers of tho&s;e Times af|firms,
<HI>viz.</HI> that the King was re&s;olved upon
&s;etting up Epi&s;copacy, and had named the Bi|&s;hops
to every Dioce&s;s<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Calderwood, <HI>fol.</HI> 358.</NOTE>, before Mr. <HI>Black</HI>'s
Declinature above. It is no more to be won|dred
at, 'that tho' his Maje&s;ty might &s;ome|times
&s;eem to comply with them, for Delay, or
for other private Rea&s;ons, yet that they always
found he changed his Mind when it came to
the Point to be concluded.</P>
<P>It would be endle&s;s to &s;et down here the
many Particulars of this Breach. Take the Sum
of them thus. Upon the failing of the many
Attempts to accommodate Matters, the Mini|&s;ters
preached openly and vehemently again&s;t
<PB N="145" REF="148">
the King's Proceedings, defended the Juri&s;diction
of the Church, and daily drew the People to them.
this nettled and alarmed the King: He attempt|ed
to per&s;wade the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the A&s;&s;embly
by fair Means, to direct the Mini&s;ters not to
meddle. They an&s;wered, they could not be
&s;ilent, while he went on to &s;ap the Foundati|ons
of their Liberties, and overthrow the Di&s;|cipline;
that it was their Duty to &s;peak freely
and plainly: When Per&s;wa&s;ions availed not, he
$&s;ed Force; he charged the Commi&s;&s;ioners of
the A&s;&s;embly to depart the City of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI>
and publi&s;h'd this Charge at the Cro&s;s of <HI>Edin|$urgh:</HI>
He ordered the Council to proceed a|gain&s;t
Mr. <HI>David Black,</HI> notwith&s;tanding his De|clinature,
and to condemn him of Contumacy,
$entencing him to enter into Ward, upon Pain
of <HI>Rebellion</HI> and <HI>Horning:</HI> His Crime was &s;aid to
be, <HI>For trea&s;onable, uncivil, &s;laderous, and &s;editi|ous
Words, Calumnies, and Speeches uttered by him
again&s;t the Queen, the Queen of</HI> England, <HI>the
Nobility, Council, and Se&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, the King refu&s;ed grant the
Stipends to the <HI>Northern</HI> Mini&s;ters, for whom
the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the A&s;&s;embly had petiti|oned;
the King's An&s;wer was, <HI>That &s;uch as would
aknowledge his Authority, &s;hould have their Sala|$ies;
but he would give no Fee to &s;uch as would
di&s;claim their Obedience.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the Commi&s;&s;ioners being warn'd to de|part,
they publi&s;hed an Exhortation to the
Presbytery of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> as they &s;hould an&s;wer
it to God and his Church, to di&s;charge their
Duty in &s;o nece&s;&s;ary and dangerous a juncture,

Enemies of the Church, of what&s;oever
Rank, and proceed again&s;t them, even to Ex|communication,

comunication, if they relaxed not: Likewi&s;e
to the Mini&s;ters of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> to &s;tand to their
Calling, and not to be &s;lack in their Duty;
with Caution however that if Violence was
u&s;ed; for there was a Report, that they &s;hould
be pull'd out of their Pulpits by armed
Men, they &s;hould give Place to the Fury, and
make no Re&s;i&s;tance; and then publi&s;hing a long
Declaration, for Vindication of their Proceed|ings,
and prote&s;ting again&s;t the Inju&s;tice that
was u&s;ed towards them, they departed. This
was in <HI>December</HI> 1596.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Month the King fell upon the Mi|ni&s;ters
of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and without any particala$
Accu&s;ation or Crime alledged, charg'd Fo$
of them, <HI>viz. Robert Bruce, James Balfour, Wal|ter,

the &s;aid civil or criminal Cau&s;es intended, or
to be intended again&s;t any of us, in time
coming; but rather that our Offence is the
greater, in Ca&s;e any of us commit &s;uch Crimes
in the &s;aid Pulpits (which God forbid) where
the Word of God, his Truth and Salvation
&s;hould be preached by us unto our Flocks. In
Witne&s;s whereof, and of our humble Acknow|ledging
of our Duty in the Premises, we have
&s;ub&s;cribed the&s;e Pre&s;ents with our Hands,
and are content the &s;ame be regi&s;trat in the
Books of our Sovereign's &s;ecret Council <HI>in
futuram rei memoriam.</HI></P>
<P>After this, <HI>for now the Mask was thrown off,</HI>
Proclamation was publi&s;h'd, by Sound of
$rumpet, at the Cro&s;s of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> empower|ing
<PB N="148" REF="151">
and requiring all Magi&s;trates, Barons, and
Gentlemen of Power, to interrupt any of the
Mini&s;ters if they &s;hould utter any Speeches ten|ding
to Sedition from their Pulpits; or any
Speeches, in Reproach, Contempt, or Di&s;dain
of the King, his Progenitors, or his Council, an$
any of their Proceedings; and to impri&s;on an$
detain them till Notice &s;hould be given to the
Council, and Orders from thence received|about them.</P>
<P>To this Pa&s;s Things were come, in the Space
of one Year.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;ters, generally &s;peaking, refu&s;ed the
Band, with Abhorrence; and published their
Rea&s;ons for it, with their Apologies and
De|fences in abundance; and &s;ome publick Meet|ings
did the like, as the Synod of <HI>Fife</HI> in par|ticular.</P>
<P>We are now come to a Meeting, called By
the King a General A&s;&s;embly; but not owned to be &s;u$
by the Church. The King having, as is &s;aid, claim|ed
the Right of calling the General A&s;&s;embly
tho' the Church had by no Means yielded $word$
that Point, his Maje&s;try thought fit to act upon
that Right, and &s;ummoned a Convention of Mi|ni&s;ters
at <HI>Perth,</HI> to meet the <HI>28th</HI> of <HI>February</HI>
1597. The Mini&s;ters, who came thither,
$word$ <HI>at the King's Appointment,</HI> &s;o there was a Viola|tion
of the Liberties of the Church, in the
ve|ry Entrance; for, by the Con&s;titution, the Churc$has
the Right of calling, as well as of con&s;titu|ting
their A&s;&s;emblies. But this was not all; fo$
as the A&s;&s;embly was called by the King, $word$
were the Members nominated chiefly by him
and e&s;pecially the <HI>Northern</HI> Mini&s;ters, who ap|peared
in an unu&s;ual Number; and yet. as it was
they were for &s;ome time doubtful, whether t$
<PB N="149" REF="152">
$ave it called an A&s;&s;embly or not: Old <HI>James
$&s;elvin</HI> denied it to be an A&s;&s;embly; but the
<HI>Northern</HI> Men outvoted them, the King al&s;o
$ining his Authority: However, eight Presby|eres
entirely oppo&s;ed it, eleven, on the other
Hand, approving it: The Commi&s;&s;ioners of the
$resbytery of <HI>Fife</HI> made a Prote&s;tation again&s;t
$word$ and again&s;t all that &s;hould be done in it.</P>
<P>Two Things the King attempted here upon
$em, yet neither &s;ucceeded thoroughly. Fir&s;t,
$e King, on Pretence of conferring with them
$n &s;ome Affairs of Moment, appoints them to
$eet, in the &s;ame Place, with the King and his
$&s;tates. This was a Wyle, to bring them to
$ive fitten as it were in Parliament; but the
$und Mini&s;ters &s;aw it, and prote&s;ted again&s;t
$. Next, the King would have entered into
$i&s;cour&s;e of the Point in Controver&s;ie, but the
$me Mini&s;ters refu&s;ed to put any of the Heads
$c their Di&s;cipline in Que&s;tion; neither would
$ey rea&s;on or &s;peak upon them at all. The
King pre&s;s'd it, but to no Purpo&s;e: The King
$ried them again, and they came to the Place,
$ut would enter upon no Bu&s;ine&s;s there; but
$ade a long Prote&s;tation again&s;t whatever &s;hould
$word$ done in that Meeting, as not being lawful|$y
con&s;tituted.</P>
<P>Having thus denied the Legality of this A&s;|$embly,
and refu&s;ed to act, the King was left
$word$ go on as he liked; nor are the Things done,
$aid to be rightly recorded, or any Dependance
$ be had upon them. But in a Word, the
King went on his own Way, and brought his
$nds about by &s;uch arbitrary Methods, and yet
$y a &s;pecious Pretence of legal Steps, as may ea|$ly
he imagin'd. He exhibited 13 Articles to
$hem, every one of which was a Violation of
<PB N="150" REF="153">
their former Di&s;cipline; the Con&s;equence of
this was bringing in the excommunicated Lords,
and at length &s;etting up Epi&s;copacy in the
Church.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, the legal A&s;&s;embly had
been appointed to meet at <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> on the
<HI>27th</HI> of <HI>April</HI> 1597, and the Moderator of the
former A&s;&s;embly went thither accordingly, and
tho' the Number was not great, yet they met
in Form, con&s;tituted them&s;elves regularly, and
having begun the A&s;&s;embly with Prayer, as u|&s;ual,
and appointed a Fa&s;t for Confe&s;&s;ion of Sins,
they made Prote&s;tations for the Liberty of the
Church, and referr'd all other Bu&s;ine&s;s to the
next Meeting. This is the A&s;&s;embly which the
King di&s;owned.</P>
<P>The King, in the mean Time, went on the
other Way, and appoints another A&s;&s;embly of
his new Model, to meet at <HI>Dundee,</HI> in the
Month of <HI>May</HI> after. Thus the Church was
mi&s;erably divided, and her Di&s;cipline trodden
under Foot: At this A&s;&s;embly the King, as it
is &s;aid, aimed at Two Things, <HI>viz.</HI> (1.) Bring|ing
in the excommunicated Lords. And (2.)
acknowledging the Meeting at <HI>Perth</HI> for a
A&s;&s;embly of the Church; both which the King&punc;
who had, by this Time, <HI>wheedled off,</HI> or <HI>brought off</HI>
many of the poorer of the Mini&s;try to his Par|ty,
ea&s;ily obtained; &s;ome complying for Pre|ferment,
&s;ome for the Honour, and &s;ome the
Profits of the Court; for it was an ea&s;ie Mat|ter,
<HI>&s;ays the Hi&s;torian of that Time, Mr.</HI> Calder|wood,
to draw &s;uch as thir&s;ted for Gain and
Glory, to farther the Intentions of the Court&punc;
Thus a dreadful Schi&s;m was made in the Church
Which al&s;o became wider every Day. The A&s;|&s;embly
<PB N="151" REF="154">
of <HI>Dundee</HI> ab&s;olved the Popi&s;h Lords;
gave up the Liberty of Rebuking the Crimes of
the great ones; committed Matters of the great|$e&s;t
Import to a few, and tho&s;e &s;uch as appear|ed
devoted to the Court; quitted &s;ummary Ex|communication,
tho' for notorious Crimes; a|boli&s;hed
all Meetings of Mini&s;ters, not warrant|ed
by the King, or forbidden; and all eccle&s;i|a&s;tick
Matters to be treated of in the A&s;&s;embly,
were, by this Model, to be fir&s;t prepared and de|termined
of by the King: So, <HI>&s;ays the &s;ame Wri|ter,</HI>
the A&s;&s;embly was now no more than the
King's LED HORSE; and all this was
brought to pa&s;s by subtle dividing the Mi|ni&s;ters,
and awing or enticing &s;ome from the
re&s;t; who, back'd and &s;upported by the King,
and joined with the Creatures of the Court,
carried on his De&s;igns to the Ruin of all true
Religion.</P>
<P>And now came on the grand De&s;ign; for the
King having gained a Number of <HI>fal&s;e Brethren,</HI>
(a remarkable Word) he had every Thing done
to his Hand. The Parliament being &s;itting,
the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the General A&s;&s;embly pe|tition,
in the Name of the Church, <HI>tho' fal&s;ely;
for the main Body of the Church abhorred the Thought
of &s;uch a Thing,</HI> for Mini&s;ters to be allowed to &s;it
and vote in Parliament. This was granted, and
pa&s;s'd into an Act, and the very Words of the Act
openly declared the Meaning of the Thing, (<HI>viz</HI>)
That tho&s;e Mini&s;ters who &s;hould vote in Parlia|ment
&s;hould be Bi&s;hops, or Prelates. The Words are
the&s;e: <HI>That &s;uch Pa&s;tors</HI> and Mini&s;ters as his Maje&s;ty
&s;hall, at any Time, plea&s;e to provide to the Office, Place,
Title, and Dignity of Bi&s;hop, Abbot, <HI>or other</HI> Prelate,
<HI>&s;hall at any Time hereafter, have Vote in Parliament,</HI>
<PB N="152" REF="155">
as by the<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Acts of Parliament for</HI> Scotland, Part 1. page 177.</NOTE> Act may be &s;een at large, This was
in <HI>December</HI> 1597.</P>
<P>On the <HI>7th</HI> of <HI>March</HI> 1598, another <HI>Royal
A&s;&s;embly,</HI> for &s;uch it was, <HI>not an A&s;&s;embly of the
Church,</HI> met at <HI>Dundee,</HI> of which I need &s;ay no
more than this, that by the &s;ame Art and Ma|nagement
that the re&s;t was carried on, the Act
of Parliament, for Mini&s;ters to vote in Parlia|ment,
was approved, in the &s;aid A&s;&s;embly, with
all the Formality and Pretence of Good to the
Church imaginable.</P>
<P>The Glory of the pure&s;t Church in the World,
<HI>I u&s;e the King's own Words,</HI> being thus under
an almo&s;t total Eclip&s;e, was &s;trangely repre&s;ent|ed
ed that &s;ame Year in the Firmament, the mo&s;t,
glorious Lamp of Heaven, the <HI>S&V;N,</HI> &s;uffering at
this Time, a mo&s;t fearful Eclip&s;e, <HI>&s;o the Hi&s;to|rians
of that Day call it,</HI> the whole Face of the
Sun being covered and darkened; but it plea|&s;ed
God to put them in mind by it, that altho'
it was of a long Duration, <HI>viz.</HI> near Two Hours
before it went quite off, yet the Sun recover|ed
again its full Lu&s;tre. And thus the Church
of <HI>Scotland</HI> likewise has &s;ince done after many
dreadful Eclip&s;es and Hours of Darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>The next Year fini&s;h'd the Work: The gi|ving
the Mini&s;ters a Vote in Parliament had
been already pa&s;t; the King &s;ummoned a Num|ber
of Mini&s;ters to a Conference at <HI>Halyrcod-Hou&s;e,</HI>
where he thought fit to have &s;ome of
the be&s;t Sort called; but took Care to &s;ecure
a Majority of his own Party: Here, for Forma|lity
Sake, tho&s;e Things were debated and re|&s;olved,
which the King before had re&s;olved,
<PB N="153" REF="156">
without debating: The Que&s;tions were not, if
the giving the Mini&s;ters Votes &s;hould be con|firmed;
that was pa&s;t and over before; but <HI>how
many</HI> their Number &s;hould be, who &s;hould <HI>chu&s;e
them,</HI> and <HI>what Title</HI> they &s;hould have? Where,
finally, their Number, and the Choice of them,
was left to the King; and it was ordered that
they &s;hould have the Title of <HI>BISHOP.</HI> And
thus this long contriv'd De&s;ign obtained its fi|ni&s;hing
Stroke, and Epi&s;copacy was e&s;tabli&s;hed
in, or rather upon the Ruins of, the Church of
<HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>I have been more particular in this Part, as
it relates to the Manner how Epi&s;copacy got
its fir&s;t footing in the Church of <HI>Scotland;</HI> that
the Fraud, the Artifice, and hypocritical Fawn|ings,
the arbitrary and outragious Dealing,
which were practi&s;ed with the Mini&s;ters, might
appear; as al&s;o the Strugglings and Oppo&s;iti|on
it met with for &s;o many Years. The next
&s;ucceeding Years will require little to be &s;aid:
The King had gain'd his Point; the Gradati|ons,
by which Epi&s;copacy proceeded, as it ever
idid in <HI>Scotland,</HI> from Power to Per&s;ecution, and
at length to its own Ruin and Downfal; as
they were publick, &s;o our Account &s;hall be
more conci&s;e and general.</P>
<P>The Time drew near now that the King was
to receive an Addition of Glory, and be call|ed
to a Kingdom infinitely more opulent, po|pulous,
and powerful than his own; and with|al,
wrapt up in that Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Hierarchy
which he &s;o much de&s;ir'd; in the mean Time,
he &s;pent the Hours in daily Conte&s;ts with the
Presbyterian Mini&s;ters, <HI>for the other are not now
to be called &s;o,</HI> oppre&s;&s;ing, impri&s;oning, remo|ving,
bani&s;hing; &s;o that no &s;ooner was he be|come
<PB N="154" REF="157">
come a King of an Epi&s;copal Church, but, as
was always natural to the Spirit of Epi&s;copacy
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> he became a Per&s;ecutor; nay, a
Per&s;ecutor of that very Church, which, as before
is ob&s;erved, he had, in the Face of the A&s;&s;embly,
with Eyes and Hands lifted up to Heaven, &s;o|lemnly
prai&s;ed and ble&s;&s;ed God for being born
in, and made King of; calling it, <HI>alas i with
what Hypocri&s;ie!</HI> the pure&s;t, the &s;incere&s;t Church
on Earth.</P>
<P>This was the Time when the King writ that
flattering Letter to the Pope, &s;tiling him, in the
Beginning, <HI>Beati&s;&s;ime Pater Pontificem maximum,</HI>
and the like; which, to e&s;cape the Cen&s;ure of, he
cau&s;ed, many Years afterwards, the Reproach
of to be laid upon another Per&s;on, who, it was
pretended, deceived the King; and having pri|vately
penn'd the Letter, got the King to &s;ign
it in a Crowd of other Writings which were
to pa&s;s the Sign-Manual, and which the King
&s;igned of Cour&s;e, without reading; but if other
Authors may be believ'd, the King, who, was
not To hurried with Bu&s;ine&s;s, while King of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> but that, in other Ca&s;es, he was quick
&s;ighted enough, and u&s;ed not to let the &s;malle&s;t
Matter pa&s;s unob&s;erved, was not to be thus de|ceived.</P>
<P>This was the Time when Mr. <HI>John Spot&s;wood,</HI>
who was pro&s;ecuted e$n by the King's Friends
in the Church, for having been at <HI>MASS</HI> o|penly
in France, was protected by the King
from their Cen&s;ure, and afterwards made Arch|bi&s;hop
of St. <HI>Andrews;</HI> the &s;ame who writ the
Hi&s;tory afterwards of the&s;e Times, and is &s;o
often quoted in the&s;e Memoirs.</P>
<P>On the <HI>31&s;t</HI> of <HI>March</HI> 1603, an Expre&s;s ar|rived
from <HI>England,</HI> bringing News of the Death
<PB N="155" REF="158">
of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> with Letters of Recogniti|on
from the Privy-Council there, who had pro|claimed
his Maje&s;ty King of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ire|land.</HI>
As the King read the Letters, his Coun|tenance
Chang'd; the Lords near-hand feared he
bad been taken ill, when, on a &s;udden, he left
off reading, and lift up his Hands and Eyes to
Heaven, as tho' he had prayed; and giving the
better to one of the Lords that &s;tood next him,
&s;aid, The <HI>Queen's dead: Read that Letter,</HI> Man.</P>
<P>Immediately the Lords congratulated him,
and the Court rung with Joy; the Guns at the
Ca&s;tle were fired, and the King was proclaim|ed
at the Market-Cro&s;s of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> King of
<HI>England, France,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The next Sabbath, being the <HI>3d</HI> of <HI>April,</HI> the
King made the following Speech to the People,
in the great Church, which, I ob&s;erve, becau&s;e
he &s;carce ever performed one Word of it at all.</P>
<P>As God hath promoved me to a greater Power,
than I had; &s;o I mu&s;t endeavour to e&s;tabli&s;h Re|ligion,
and to take away Corruption, in both the
Countries. Ye need not doubt, but as I have a Body
as able as any King in <HI>Europe,</HI> whereby I am a|ble
to travel; &s;o I &s;hall vi&s;it you every Three Years
at lea&s;t, or oftner as I &s;hall have Occa&s;ion; (for
&s;o have I written in my Book directed to my Son,
and it were a Shame to me not to perform that,
which I have written) that I may with my own
Mouth take Account of the Execution of Ju&s;tice
of them that are under me; and that ye your &s;elves
may &s;ee and hear me, and from the meane&s;t to the
greate&s;t have Acce&s;s to my Per&s;on, and pour out your
Complaints in my Bo&s;om. This &s;hall ever be my
Cour&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="159">
The Triumphs of this new Acce&s;&s;ion of
Power to the King, his Pa&s;&s;age into <HI>England,</HI>
his Reception there, his Coronation, and other
Ceremonies, are no Part of this Work; I &s;hall
&s;ay only this of them, that they, together with the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bu&s;ine&s;s, almo&s;t took the King wholly off
of <HI>Scots</HI> Affairs for the fir&s;t two or three Years
of his Reign, and he did little but confirm and
e&s;tabli&s;h his new Fabrick in the Church.</P>
<P>In this Condition Things &s;tood with the
Church almo&s;t all the re&s;t of the Reign of
King <HI>James,</HI> the Authority of the Church Judi|catories
was wholly lo&s;t, their Di&s;cipline de|&s;troyed,
and the Government di&s;&s;olved into a
prelatick Hierarchy.</P>
<P>It is true, the King being ab&s;ent, and em|barra&s;s'd
with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Affairs, they did not
pu&s;h on the de&s;igned Per&s;ecution &s;o far, or &s;o
fa&s;t, as, its very likely, he would otherwi&s;e
have done; but &s;till the Council continued daily
to invade the Privileges of the Church, and by
Encroachments of one Kind or other, went on
to oppre&s;s them; and upon every Step the Mi|ni&s;ters
took, to a&s;&s;ert their Right, or defend
their Privileges, they were proceeded again&s;t by
the Council as Criminals; and once no le&s;s than
Six of the Mini&s;ters were tried for high Trea|&s;on,
and condemned to Death, for declining the
Judicature of the Council, and continuing to
a&s;&s;emble at Aberdeen, without the King's Authority;
but the King would not fuffer them
to be executed: What he did with them we
&s;hall &s;ee pre&s;ently. Fir&s;t, a Proclamation was
publi&s;hed, forbidding all People, either in pub|lick
or private, to call in Que&s;tion his Maje&s;ty's
Proceedings again&s;t the &s;aid Mini&s;ters. Then
the Cau&s;e &s;lept a while, the Parliament being
<PB N="157" REF="160">
to meet. This was the Year 1606, when the
Parliament met at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> but was adjourn|ed
to <HI>Perth;</HI> in which the Act was pa&s;s'd, enti|tuled,
<HI>The Act for Re&s;titution of Bi&s;hops,</HI> by
which the Temporalities of the old Bi&s;hopricks
were likewi&s;e re&s;tored to the Church, having
before been given to the Crown by a Law call|ed
the<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Act of <HI>Scots</HI> Parliament, Part 1. pag. 759.</NOTE> Act of Annexation.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Thing of Note which happened
after the King's Acce&s;&s;ion to the Crown of <HI>En|gland,</HI>
and the la&s;t Thing of this Nature which
we &s;hall bring into the&s;e Memoirs was, That
memorable Conference at <HI>Hampton-Courts,</HI> be|tween
the eight Mini&s;ters of the Presbyterian
Church and the King, upon the Matters then in
Di&s;pute. The Ca&s;e in &s;hort was this, the Pre&s;|byterian
Mini&s;ters had met in an A&s;&s;embly, as
was already noted, at <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> without the
King's Authority, as they in&s;i&s;ted they might
legally do; the King di&s;charg'd or di&s;&s;olv'd
their Meeting as illegal, but they continued to
meet for all that: And when &s;ome of them
were delated, or indicted, <HI>as we call it,</HI> before
the Court of Ju&s;tice for that Contempt, they
declined the Authority of the King, <HI>that is to
&s;ay,</HI> his Authority to take Cognizance of tho&s;e
Affairs; for they never di&s;puted his Authority
in Civil Matters: For this they were again in|dicted,
brought to Trial, found guilty of high
Trea&s;on, and received Sentence of Death, as
above.</P>
<P>But the King finding, that this pu&s;hing
Things to Extremity would not fully an&s;wer his
End, and willing rather to proceed by other
<PB N="158" REF="161">
Methods, concluded at length to have the Cau&s;e
brought to <HI>London,</HI> where it &s;hould be publick|ly
heard before him&s;elf and the Council, not
doubting but it &s;hould be &s;o managed there, as
that he &s;hould either really have the Victory, or
at lea&s;t &s;eem to have it; hereupon making &s;hew
to de&s;ire an Agreement, he (the King) cau&s;ed
a certain Number of the <HI>Scots</HI> Mini&s;ters on both

at <HI>London.</HI> Their Names were as follow, (<HI>viz.</HI>)</P>

<P>After that Conference, as it was called, was
over, and the King had found that neither, by
Per&s;wa&s;ion, nor Threatning, any thing was to
be done with them, &s;o as to get the Power, he
ad a&s;&s;umed, confirmed by them, or the Pro|ceedings

di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them, and went to work with the
Mini&s;ters who were under Sentence: He found
it not for his Purpo&s;e to put them to Death;
he knew too well what a Flame it would kin|dle

Show of Re&s;entment upon it as he thought

Mini&s;ters were brought, to receive
their Sentence, which the King was plea&s;ed to
change from that of Death into that of Ba|ni&s;hment,
never to return, on Pain of Death.

<P>The&s;e Mini&s;ters thus &s;ent into Bani&s;hment,
were al&s;o commanded not to come out of the
Bounds of their Confinement, upon Pain of
Death; and by another Proclamation, all other
Mini&s;ters were forbidden to recommend, in
their Prayers or Sermons, any of tho&s;e &s;o &s;en|tenc'd:
This was e&s;teemed a greater Cruelty
than the re&s;t; likewi&s;e the Mini&s;ters at Court,
were forbidden to go back to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and one
of them, <HI>viz.</HI> Mr. <HI>Andrew Melvin</HI> was taken
up, on Pretence of Words &s;poken in <HI>London,</HI>
and &s;ome <HI>Latin</HI> Ver&s;es made by him, reflecting
on the Cathedral-Wor&s;hip in <HI>England,</HI> and was
&s;ent to the Tower, and kept there Three Years,
after which he was bani&s;hed into <HI>France,</HI> where
he ended his Days.</P>
<P>But Things ended not here; for the King
being not able to get his Will of the Mini|&s;ters
by the Violences above; continued, notwith&s;tanding,
to make Innovations in their Di&s;|cipline
and Government, and therefore in the
<PB N="161" REF="164">
A&s;&s;embly held at <HI>Linlithgow, December</HI> 10. 1606,
he brought in. the Overture of <HI>con&s;tant Modera|tors</HI>
in the Presbyteries, and the Mini&s;ters of
the A&s;&s;embly being always a Majority of the
wrong Side, after a few had oppo&s;ed it, agreed
to admit them upon &s;ome Conditions, tho'
they could never bring the Presbyteries to ac|cept
of them.</P>
<P>But now came on a Blow which even the
Mini&s;ters them&s;elves did not fore&s;ee, I mean
the Five Articles concerning Wor&s;hip, called
afterwards <HI>the Articles of</HI> Perth. The Con&s;ti|tution
of the Church con&s;i&s;ts, as it is political|ly
understood of 4 principal Heads, <HI>viz.</HI> (1.)
Her Doctrine. (2.) Her Wor&s;hip. (3) Her Di&s;|cipline.
And, (4.) Her Government. The two
la&s;t were effectually redue'd, and the King had
his Will of them, as you have heard; her Do|ctrine
and Wor&s;hip &s;eemed &s;till to remain.
But now the King began to attack their Wor|&s;hip,
being re&s;olved to bring the Church's
Neck under the Feet of her Enemies.</P>
<P>It was the Year 1617, when the King took
this Journey into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and where it was
expected, by his Pre&s;ence, he &s;hould carry eve|ry
Point; but he failed in &s;everal. And fir&s;t,
at the Meeting of the Parliament he propo&s;ed
an Article, importing, &startq;That whatever was
re&s;olved or concluded, by his Maje&s;ty, with
Advice of the Archbi&s;hops and Bi&s;hops, in
Matters of external Polity in the Church,
&s;hould have the Force of an Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Law.&endq;
This was a bold Stroke, even the Bi&s;hops them|&s;elves
&s;tartled at it <HI>at fir&s;t,</HI> and the Mini&s;ters
&s;igned a general Prote&s;tation again&s;t it, which
the King coming to the Knowledge of, the Ar|ticle
was dropped, and &s;o the Prote&s;tation was
<PB N="162" REF="165">
not delivered in; but the King re&s;olved to
exerci&s;e the Power <HI>without the Ceremony of an
Act,</HI> as we &s;hall &s;ee pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>The King &s;ummoned the Bi&s;hops to meet
him at St. <HI>Andrews,</HI> where, in a &s;et Speech to
them, he propo&s;ed what he after obtained the
Bi&s;hops referred him to an A&s;&s;embly, but the
King, who owned that he re&s;olved never to
have any more A&s;&s;emblies, was very aver&s;e to
an A&s;&s;embly, and it was now evident that the
Rea&s;on why the King had propo&s;ed formerly
the Article abovenamed was, that the Power
of making Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Laws being ve&s;ted in
him&s;elf, he might have no more Occa&s;ion for
A&s;&s;emblies, which even, tho' Epi&s;copal, were
very much his Aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>However, in &s;hort, upon the Entreaty of the
Bi&s;hops, and Promi&s;es of Compliance in &s;ome
<HI>Time-&s;erving Mini&s;ters,</HI> the King called an A&s;|&s;embly
to meet at <HI>Perth,</HI> the <HI>25th</HI> of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI>
1617. There had been one held at St. <HI>An|drews</HI>
the <HI>November</HI> before, which di&s;gu&s;ted
the King very much in not complying with
his Demands.</P>
<P>In this A&s;&s;embly the Wor&s;hip, as well as
the Di&s;cipline was innovated, and the Conclu|&s;ions
were pa&s;s'd in the following Heads, af|terwards
called, as above, <HI>the 5 Articles of</HI>
Perth. The Articles at large are to be found
in the<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Spot&s;wood, Hi&s;t. of the Church of</HI> Scot. <HI>fol.</HI> 539.</NOTE> Hi&s;tories<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Calderwood <HI>fol.</HI> 611.</NOTE> of tho&s;e Times; but
in &s;hort, they contained, (1.) The Kneeling at
the Communion. (2.) Private Communion at
&s;ick Peoples Reque&s;t. (3.) Private Bapti&s;m. (4.)
<PB N="163" REF="166">
Confirmation of Children. (5.) Ob&s;ervation of
Fe&s;tivals. All which was now to be impo&s;ed
upon the Church of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>When the Articles were pa&s;t, Order was &s;ent
to all the Mini&s;ters to intimate them in their
Churches, to exhort the People to conform to
them, and to preach upon the Lawfulne&s;s of it.
But this it was never in their Power to do, nor,
where Mini&s;ters did conform, was it in their
Power to make the People comply with, or
hear them; but a dreadful Rent being thus
made in the Church, the People divided from
the Mini&s;ters, and the di&s;&s;enting Mini&s;ters &s;et
up private Communions, and were almo&s;t uni|ver&s;ally
followed, as will appear pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>But to return to the Affair of the Mini|&s;ters
in <HI>England,</HI> the <HI>Scots</HI> Mini&s;ters beha|ved
with &s;uch Courage and &s;uch Steddine&s;s,
that the Court could get no Ground of them;
but was forc'd to have Recour&s;e to Coercion
and Per&s;ecution in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and in <HI>England</HI> al|&s;o:
The Six Mini&s;ters, in&s;tead of being di&s;pu|ted
with, were imprisoned, and long harra&s;s'd
from Place to Place; &s;o that &s;ome of them
never &s;aw <HI>Scotland</HI> more. If I enter not far in|to
the Particulars of tho&s;e Times, it is becau&s;e $
would not record &s;ome Things practi&s;ed up|on
them by &s;ome of the Clergy in <HI>England,</HI>
which it may not be grateful to Po&s;terity to
hear; for it is not the Conduct in <HI>England,</HI>
but the Conduct in <HI>Scotland</HI> that the&s;e Memoirs
$re written about.</P>
<P>The Sum of the Matter is this, in few
Words; the King having mi&s;s'd of his Triumph,
and of reducing the Mini&s;ters to a Nece&s;&s;ity of
submitting, re&s;olved however not to mi&s;s of
is De&s;ign in <HI>Scotland;</HI> and to this End he e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
<PB N="164" REF="167">
a high Commi&s;&s;ion-Court there, to en|force
the Articles of <HI>Perth,</HI> and in a Word,
to aboli&s;h the Con&s;titution of the Church of
<HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t, in&s;tead of the General A&s;&s;embly, the
King, by his &s;pecial Warrant, &s;ummoned a
Convention, not of the E&s;tates, but of Mini|&s;ters,
to meet at <HI>Linlithgo,</HI> the <HI>10th</HI> of <HI>December</HI>
1606; in&s;tead of the Presbyteries electing the
Mini&s;ters, as was u&s;ual. to repre&s;ent them, the
King's Letter was &s;ent, directed to the Pres|byteries,
ordering them to &s;end &s;uch Men, by
Name, as the King had directed. Let any <HI>En|gli&s;hman</HI>
conceive of this, as if the King of <HI>En|gland</HI>
were to &s;ummon a Parliament to meet at
<HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> and in&s;tead of i&s;&s;uing out Writs,
for Elections of Members, &s;hould name the
Members whom they &s;hould &s;end tip. This, was
the Method in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and with the &s;ame
Ju&s;tice; and becau&s;e this is a Novelty that ne|ver
was practi&s;ed before or &s;ince, I have given
the Copy of the Warrant, for thus &s;ending up
of Mini&s;ters, at the End of this Part, <HI>No.</HI> D.</P>
<P>In this Meeting the Project of con&s;tant Mo|derators
in the Presbyteries was propo&s;ed, it is
called the King's Advice to the A&s;&s;embly; but
any one may gue&s;s what the Meaning of &s;uch a
Phra&s;e mu&s;t be; when King's advi&s;e, e&s;pecially
to their own Subjects, they will not take it $word$
if their People take it for a Command, and &s;o
it prov'd; for the Act pa&s;t without
on.</P>
<P>Great Arts were u&s;ed, and &s;ome Violence, to
bring the Presbyteries to accept the&s;e con&s;tan
Moderators, nor could all the Threatnings and
Violence that was practi&s;ed, bring them to it
The Presbytery of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> was told plainly
<PB N="165" REF="168">
that if the Presbyteries refu&s;ed them, the King
would overthrow the Presbyteries them&s;elves,
and there &s;hould be no more in <HI>Scotland;</HI> but
all would not do: They named a Moderator
pro <HI>interim,</HI> to continue to the next General
A&s;&s;embly, and, would do no otherwi&s;e; and the
like did other Presbyteries al&s;o.</P>
<P>At length the Presbyteries were charg'd, in
he King's Name, and on Pain of Rebellion,
and putting them to the Horn, to accept them:
his prevail'd with &s;ome, but many &s;tood out,
and &s;ome of the Moderators them&s;elves refu&s;ed
accept. Not one of the Synods in <HI>Scotland</HI>
would accept them, except <HI>Angus;</HI> no Threats,
$o Cunning, for neither were wanting, could
bring them to it.</P>
<P>By this Time the Court found that all the
Arts hitherto u&s;ed, for &s;ubverting the Church,
however they might e&s;tabli&s;h a new Con&s;titu|tion,
would never bring the Mini&s;ters to com|ply,
till they came to downright Per&s;ecution;
and therefore it was re&s;olved to take that Cour&s;e
by a high Commi&s;&s;ion-Court, in the Pur&s;uit of
who&s;e Powers, the Mini&s;ters were to be brought
by Violence, by Per&s;ecution, Horning, that is
$o &s;ay, Bani&s;hment and Confi&s;cation of Goods,
$o abandon their Flocks, and lay down the
Office of Mini&s;ters.<NOTE PLACE="foot">Calderwood, <HI>fol.</HI> 550.</NOTE></P>
<P>It was in the Year 1616, that the Commi&s;&s;ion|-Courts
were fir&s;t erected, <HI>viz.</HI> one in each Arch|bi&s;hoprick.
This Commi&s;&s;ion was the highe&s;t
Exerci&s;e of Tyranny that was ever practi&s;ed
by any King in <HI>Great Britain</HI> &s;ince Laws and
Con&s;titutions were allowed to be the Rule of
<PB N="166" REF="169">
the Government; for it actually put the King
in, Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Bodies and Goods of all his
Subjects, and empowered him to u&s;e them as
he plea&s;ed, without the ordinary Forms of Ju|&s;tice,
and meerly by the Agency of the Clergy
making the Bi&s;hops the In&s;truments of ab&s;olute
Power, not only to ruin and de&s;troy the Li|berties
of the Church, but even of the whole
Country, Clergy or Laity. The Copy of this
famous Commi&s;&s;ion is among the <HI>Addenda,</HI> at
the End of this Part, <HI>No.</HI> E.</P>
<P>How they exerci&s;ed this unlimited Authori|ty,
the Hi&s;tories of tho&s;e Times are Witne&s;&s;es,
in which whoever plea&s;es to look, will find
the Epi&s;copal Clergy were not backward to
merit the general Reproach ca&s;t upon Prie&s;ts
of all Religions.</P>
<P>There is &s;carce any kind of Cruelty, Inju|&s;tice,
and Oppre&s;&s;ion to be named in the World,
which was not practi&s;ed in the Con&s;equence
of this Commi&s;&s;ion, upon the Mini&s;ters of the
Church; pre&s;ent Death, Racks, and Tortures
excepted.</P>
<P>The Ministers were be&s;et with Spies, to ob|&s;erve
their Words Ge&s;tures, and their Expre&s;|&s;ions
in their Prayers and Sermons, in order to
ob&s;erve if they offered to &s;peak again&s;t the new
Con&s;titutions. They were delated or pro&s;ecu|ted
before this Court upon &s;o many Accounts
that it was &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to avoid it; &s;uch as
&s;peaking again&s;t the Bi&s;hops, di&s;liking the Ca|non
reproving Wickedne&s;s, Vices, and Immo|ralities,
alledging they pointed at the dignified
Clergy.</P>
<P>They were delated in general upon the
Articles of <HI>Perth,</HI> upon Points of Doctrine, the
Supremacy of the King over the Church, own|ing
<PB N="167" REF="170">
or di&s;owning the General A&s;&s;emblies, and
the like.</P>
<P>In their appearing at their Courts, they were
in&s;ulted, brow-beaten, and maltreated by the
Bi&s;hops, neither treated as Gentlemen, as Scho|lars,
or as Ministers of the Go&s;pel. The Bi&s;hop
of St. <HI>Andrews</HI> in particular told them, at one
of his Meetings, that he &s;hould proceed to &s;en|tence
as he was directed, wherein he &s;hould
have no Regard to Wives, Children, or E&s;tate,
which he effectually made good; and indeed
he King's Order or Letter gave them expre&s;s
Encouragement to &s;uch Cruelty. It &s;eems the
Court thought them too relax and flow in their
Proceedings, which, if our Hi&s;tories are true,
there was little Rea&s;on for. But after the
first Commi&s;&s;ion had tyranniz'd about Three
Years, and the Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;eemed a little to re&s;t,
it was, on a &s;udden, renewed again, <HI>Anno</HI>
1619; and in <HI>November</HI> after the Bi&s;hop of St.
<HI>Andrews,</HI> &s;itting in Judgment upon &s;ome. of the
Mini&s;ters, pull'd out the King's Letter, written
from <HI>England,</HI> dated the <HI>23d</HI> of <HI>November</HI> 1619,
$$imating them to all po&s;&s;ible Severity again&s;t
the Mini&s;ters that would not comply. This
$o&s;t merciful Letter being under the King's
mo&s;t own Hand, and upon &s;uch an extraordinary
&s;tile, cannot be omitted, without leaving this
Account imperfect: The Words, &s;o far as re|$ate
to the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, are as follows, (<HI>viz.</HI>)</P>
<P>I command you, as you will be an&s;werable to me,
$at you depo&s;e all tho&s;e that refu&s;e to conform
without re&s;pect of Per&s;ons, no ways regarding the
Multitude of the Rebellious; for that, if there be
$anting Numbers to fill their Places, I will &s;end
$word$ Mini&s;ter$ out of <HI>England;</HI> and I charge you
<PB N="168" REF="171">
to certifie us of your Proceedings, betwixt this
and the 3d of <HI>March</HI> next to come.</P>
<P>As the Bi&s;hops wanted no &s;purring to a Work
they &s;o much delighted in, &s;o they fail'd not to
proceed, in con&s;equence of this Letter, with the
utmo&s;t Rigour; the Mini&s;ters were every where
cited, and upon their refu&s;ing to conform, were
deprived, impri&s;on'd, put to the Horn; their
Goods plunder'd, many of then bani&s;hed to the
I&s;lands, and the like; In their Examinations,
they were u&s;ed with all po&s;&s;ible Indignity and
Contempt; and in their Impri&s;onments, with
Rigour and Cruelty.</P>
<P>The Laity were al&s;o fallen upon for not
kneeling at the Communion, according to the
Article of <HI>Perth,</HI> and at one Time &s;ix: of the
Citizens of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> were ordered to Bani&s;h|ment,
from their Hou&s;es, Trades, and Families,
without Trial, Citation, or Form of Proce&s;s, on
Pretence that they had countenanced the Mini|&s;ters
in their Di&s;obedience.</P>
<P>I might fill this Volume with the Hi&s;tory of
the&s;e Violences, and enlarge, with great Advan|tage,
on the unprecedented Proceedings of this
tyrannical Court of Bi&s;hops: It would al&s;o be
very diverting, as well as profitable, to record
here the Conduct of the &s;uffering Mini&s;ters and
People, how &s;toutly they &s;tood, in Defence of
their Principles, how boldly they di&s;puted, and
often baffled and put to Shame the Bi&s;hops, e|&s;pecially
of St. <HI>Andrews</HI> and of <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> in the
Arguments they u&s;ed with them; as particularly
Mr. <HI>Tho. Hog,</HI> Mini&s;ter of <HI>Dy&s;ert,</HI> to the Bp. of
<HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> and Doctor <HI>Lind&s;ay,</HI> about the Differences
between Capping and Kneeling at the Sacraments.
The Bi&s;hop, it &s;eems, would have proved that Cap|ping
<PB N="169" REF="172">
or pulling off the Hat, and kneeling, were
&s;ynonimous; that they were not <HI>diver&s;ae &s;pecies ge|&s;tus,</HI>
but that they who did the fir&s;t, could not
refu&s;e the la&s;t, in which Mr. <HI>Hog</HI> &s;ilenc'd them
both, and brought the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> to &s;ay, <HI>It is long
&s;ince I learnt my</HI> Logicks, &amp;c. Mr. <HI>Hog</HI> an&s;wered,
&startq;There is no Difficulty here to any that are de|&s;irous
to learn the &s;acred Truths of the Go&s;|pel:
Capping, in religious Exerci&s;es, is an
outward Act of Veneration or Reverence on|ly,
and this we do at the Sacrament; becau&s;e
none can deny but that Reverence is due to
the Celebration of that &s;olemn Ordinance.
But Kneeling, in religious Exerci&s;es, is an Act
of Adoration or Wor&s;hip, which is proper to
God only, and therefore Exception is taken
at it in the Sacrament, lea&s;t we &s;eem to wor|&s;hip
the Elements which we receive.&endq;</P>
<P>This was &s;o plain that the Bi&s;hop could make
no Reply, and &s;o broke off the Di&s;cour&s;e; ma|ny
&s;uch Accounts, I &s;ay, might be given, both
profitable and diverting, but the &s;hort Compa&s;s
of the&s;e Memoirs admits not to enter into tho&s;e
things; it may &s;uffice to note, that they got as
little Ground by their Violence, as they did by
their Di&s;putations; and after all they could do
in this one Article of kneeling, tho' the King
&s;ent down his Letter al&s;o, &s;trictly commanding
all to kneel, yet at the Communion publi&s;hed in
<HI>Edinburgh,</HI> for Trial of the Effect of this Com|mand,
out of Sixteen Hundred Communicants
in the College-Church there, they could make
but Twenty receive kneeling, and the next
Day but &s;even, and the&s;e few were either of the
Families of the complying Epi&s;copal-Clergy,
who admini&s;tred, or the poor Alms-People,
who dur&s;t not refu&s;e; yet they publi&s;h'd in
<PB N="170" REF="173">
<HI>England</HI> that the People generally complied with
the King's Command, and that only a few ob|&s;tinate
Presbyterian Mini&s;ters &s;tood out, a Pra|ctice
we &s;ee reviv'd even lately while we were
told mighty Stories of the Willingne&s;s of the
People in <HI>Scotland</HI> in Queen <HI>Ann's</HI> Time, to re|ceive

de&s;irous they were to have it &s;et up there where|as
it &s;ince appears that it has not been receiv|ed
any where, except where the Tyranny of
their Lairds and Superiors impo&s;ed it, and that
as &s;oon as that impo&s;ing cea&s;ed, by the &s;ubdu|ing
the Rebellion under the Reign of his pre&s;ent
Maje&s;ty, we hear no more of it.</P>
<P>The la&s;t publick Step to the confirming all
this Wreck of the Church, was the getting the
Five Articles of <HI>Perth</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Sancti|on
of an Act of Parliament, and &s;o giving then
the Force of a Law; for till then they acted
meerly upon the Mandate and per&s;onal Autho|rity
of the King.</P>
<P>The Solemnity of this Tran&s;action was ex|traordinary,
the Parliament met the <HI>25th</HI> of <HI>July</HI>
1621, the Mini&s;ters were carefully fenc'd again&s;t,
that none &s;hould get into the Hou&s;e, to prote&s;t
again&s;t it; for they knew they had a Prote&s;tati|on
ready to deliver: Mr. <HI>David Barclay,</HI> one
of the Mini&s;ters, who re&s;olved to pre&s;ent the
Prote&s;tation, got into the Hou&s;e to the &s;econd
Bar, but was di&s;covered and put out again, and
at la&s;t contented hime&s;lf to read it at the Door,
and &s;tick it up again&s;t the Wall.</P>
<P>However, there was great Oppo&s;ition to this
Act, even in the Parliament it &s;elf, but the
King, by Management of the Members, and by
the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Bi&s;hops, got a Majority to
vote it; yet a great many, both Lords and
<PB N="171" REF="174">
Commons oppo&s;ed It. Among the fir&s;t, the
Lords <HI>Rothe&s;s, Mentieth, Eglintoun, Linlithgow,
Kintail, Gray, Ro&s;s, Ye&s;ter, Cathcart, Couper, Bur|lie,
Balmerinoch, Elpbing &s;ton, Torphichen, and For|be&s;s,</HI>
all publickly voted again&s;t it. The Earls
of <HI>Mortoun, Buchan,</HI> and the Marque&s;s of <HI>Lau|derdale</HI>
&s;taid without the Door, becau&s;e they
would not vote for it; and of the Commi&s;&s;ion|ers
for Shires and Burghs, Forty Four voted a|gain&s;t
it, be&s;ides nine Lords and Six and Twen|ty
Commi&s;&s;ioners that cared not to appear on
one Side or other, and came not near the Par|liament.</P>
<P>However, notwith&s;tanding all that could be
done, the Articles were voted, the Act pa&s;s'd,
and was publi&s;hed with Sound of Trumpet at
the Cro&s;s of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> the <HI>20th</HI> of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1621.</P>
<P>It is recorded by &s;everal Hi&s;torians of tho&s;e
Times, that when this Act, for confirming the
Articles of <HI>Perth,</HI> had been voted, and pa&s;s'd,
and was pre&s;ented for the <HI>KOYAL ASSE NT,</HI>
which is &s;ignified there by touching it with
the Sceptre, the Moment the high Commi&s;&s;i|oner,
the Lord <HI>Scone,</HI> &s;tood up to touch this
Act, Heaven declared its <HI>ROYAL, DISSENT,</HI>
in a mo&s;t remarkable Manner; for Three Fla&s;hes
of Lightning, one immediately after the other,
darted in at the great Window, and &s;trook di|rectly
in the Commi&s;&s;ioner's Face: He confe&s;s'd
afterwards he felt the Warmth of the Fire on
his Face; the la&s;t Fla&s;h was more frightful
than the two fir&s;t, and they were rendred th$
more vi&s;ible by an exceeding dark Cloud, which,
for &s;ome Minutes before, hung directly over
the City: The Thunder, which followed, and
broke upon the City, and as it were more im|mediately
on the Parliament-Hou&s;e, was very
<PB N="172" REF="175">
terrible, e&s;pecially the Third Clap of Thunder,
immediately after the Lightning: The Dark|ne&s;s,
occa&s;ioned by the &s;aid Cloud, encreas'd to
&s;uch a Degree, that it became frightful, and
the whole was followed by &s;o violent and &s;o
heavy a Rain, that the like had not been known
in the Memory of Man; and the Lords and
Members of Parliament, altho' their Bu&s;ine&s;s
was fini&s;hed, and the Hou&s;e broke up, were kept
pri&s;oners by the Fury of the Rain for above
an Hour, and &s;o long it continued, that when
they did go away, every one &s;hifted home as
they could; &s;o that this Act could not have
the Honour of a Proce&s;&s;ion, and to have the
Regalia carried before it, as was u&s;ual on like
Occa&s;ions. The Day got the Name of black
<HI>Saturday,</HI> upon this Account, as well as on the
Occa&s;ion of the black Work they had been a|bout.</P>
<P>Nothing but a dark Pro&s;pect of Per&s;ecution,
and a Cloud, threatening De&s;olation to the Church,
now appear'd; the Pri&s;ons were fill'd with de|priv'd
Mini&s;ters, and the remote Parts with the
Bani&s;hed, and the King's Letters came every
Po&s;t pre&s;&s;ing to more and more Severities; nay,
the Magi&s;trates of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> were threatn'd, in
expre&s;s Terms, by the King with being depo&s;ed,
and the City of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> was threatn'd with
having the Se&s;&s;ion, or Term for &s;itting of the
Courts of Ju&s;tice, removed from them to <HI>Linlith|go,</HI>
becau&s;e they were not careful to do their
Duty, in pur&s;uing the Mini&s;ters, and prevent|ing
private Conventicles; for the depriv'd Mi|ni&s;ters
preach'd in their own Hou&s;es, and Mul|titudes
left the Churches, and flock'd to hear
them.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="176">
But the Hand of Heaven interpo&s;ed in the
very Extremity, and by a &s;urprizing Event
put an End for the pre&s;ent to the Fury of tho&s;e
people; for ju&s;t as the Pro&s;ecution of Mr. <HI>Wil|liam
Rigg, John Hamilton, John Meen,</HI> and &s;eve|ral
other &s;uffering Mini&s;ters was come to the
Extremity, and they were at the Point of be|ing
&s;ent into Bani&s;hment, an Expre&s;s from
<HI>London</HI> brought the News that the King was
DEAD.</P>
<P>By this one Blow the high Commi&s;&s;ion was
di&s;&s;olved of cour&s;e, all Proceedings depending
before them dropp'd, and Abundance of good
Men were, for the pre&s;ent, delivered from the
Oppre&s;&s;ions of the Bi&s;hops.</P>
<P>But the King being &s;ucceeded by his Son
King <HI>Charles</HI> I, who was no le&s;s zealous than,
his Father in the Epi&s;copal Part of Church-Af|fairs,
the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> got no other Ad|vantage
by the Change than the Stop above
mentioned, which, by that extraordinary Inci|dent
of the Death of King <HI>James,</HI> was put to
the Per&s;ecution of the Mini&s;ters, as above.</P>
<P>On the contrary, the Epi&s;copal Model recei|ved
all po&s;&s;ible Encouragement, as may be
gue&s;t by Archbi&s;hop <HI>Spot&s;wood</HI> being made Lord
Chancellor of <HI>Scotland,</HI> till the unexpected Folly
and Madne&s;s of the Court-Party unravelled all
their own Work, and the Church ro&s;e again
upon the Ruin of her Enemies.</P>
<P>Nay, &s;uch was the &s;ignal working of di|vine
Providence, as has been &s;een more than
once in the Ca&s;e of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> than
the Oppre&s;&s;ions and Per&s;ecutions of this Church.
were made the Means of overturning, not the
Bi&s;hops only, who were the more immediate
Per&s;ecutors, but even the King him&s;elf, and all
<PB N="174" REF="177">
his Family, as will eminently appear in the
Proce&s;s of the Story.</P>
<P>The King died <HI>March 27th,</HI> 1625, the fir&s;t
Year of his Son's Reign appeared entangled &s;o
many ways, that he became le&s;s intent, for &s;ome
Time, upon the Affairs of <HI>Scotland,</HI> than his
Father had been: He was left entangled in$
War with <HI>Spain,</HI> and entred afterwards ra&s;hly
and incon&s;iderately into another with <HI>France;</HI>
in both which his People were unea&s;ie, and his
Generals unfortunate.</P>
<P>The Mi&s;management of the War, the indi|rect
Methods taken by the Court for rai&s;ing
Money, and the ill U&s;age of tho&s;e, who, upon
Principles of the Peoples Liberties, oppo&s;ed it
made the Parliament fall upon his Favorite the
Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> refu&s;e Sub&s;idies, and in|&s;i&s;t
warmly on Redre&s;s of Grievances. The&s;e
put the King &s;o out of Love with Parliaments
in <HI>England,</HI> that no Parliament was afterwards
called in Fourteen Years; during which, &s;o ma|ny
illegal and arbitrary Things were done, that
when the King was afterwards driven, by Ne|ce&s;&s;ity,
to call a Parliament, they carried their
Re&s;entment at the&s;e illegal Practices to &s;uch a
hight as drove both Parties to Arms, and end|ed
in the Overthrow, fir&s;t of the Epi&s;copal
People in <HI>Scotland,</HI> where the Flame fir&s;t broke
out. Secondly, of the whole E&s;tabli&s;hment of
the Church of <HI>England</HI> in <HI>England.</HI> And la&s;lty, in
the Ruin of the King, and of the Royal Family.</P>
<P>This &s;hort Digre&s;&s;ion to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Af|fairs
&s;hould not have been made, <HI>for I have
carefully avoided &s;uffering the&s;e</HI> Memoirs to
<HI>pa&s;s the</HI> Tweed, <HI>except on extraordinary Oc|ca&s;ions,</HI>

of Facts, and explain what is &s;aid above,
<PB N="175" REF="178">
(<HI>viz.</HI>) that the Flame of the War in <HI>England</HI>
began fir&s;t in Scotland.</P>
<P>During the long interval of Parliament in
<HI>England,</HI> the King had Lei&s;ure to apply him&s;elf
to the Affairs in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and being re&s;olved
to play <HI>Rehoboam</HI>'s Part, he met with <HI>Reboboam's</HI>
Fate: His Father had, as is &s;aid above, impo|&s;ed
Epi&s;copacy upon <HI>Scotland,</HI> and a long Series
of Time had accu&s;tomed too many of the Peo|ple
to it, or an Indifferency about it; &s;o that
it was thought had the King &s;at &s;till, he might,
$n Time, have reduced the Nation at la&s;t to
have been contented with it. But far from this,
$e not only was not content with putting Hard|&s;hips
upon the Presbyterian Mini&s;ters, but
prompted, by an evil Fate, he fell upon a
Thing which, even the Epi&s;copal People in <HI>Scot|$and</HI>
could not bear; this was impo&s;ing the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liturgy upon the <HI>Scots.</HI> This was not
only the mo&s;t ra&s;h and impolitick Part in the
Court, but it was the mo&s;t unkind and ungrate|$l
Part to his Friends in <HI>Scotland;</HI> for now the
Epi&s;copal Party them&s;elves, who had done eve|ry
violent Thing he had de&s;ired for his Service,
were fallen upon, except they would comply
with the Service-Book, which Abundance of
refu&s;ed. And thus he made his Friends
his Enemies.</P>
<P>This was the Project of Archbi&s;hop <HI>Laud</HI> in
<HI>England,</HI> who afterwards made <HI>L' Amende hono|$able,</HI>
for the&s;e and &s;everal other <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Extra|$agances

<P>The People of <HI>Scotland</HI> were greatly alarmed

<P>But the Bi&s;hops, and &s;ome Lords of the

&s;ome of the Bi&s;hops in <HI>Scotland</HI> objected again&s;t
it, that tho' they liked the Book, yet they were
di&s;gu&s;ted at its being impo&s;ed by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>

them, was amended.</P>
<P>Now, as if they were re&s;olved to irritate the
People of <HI>Scotland</HI> to the utmo&s;t, this Service-Book
was not only appointed to be read; but
the Mini&s;ter officiating was to have on the <HI>Sur|plice,</HI>
according to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cu&s;tom, which
was a new and uncouth Sight to the People of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> hateful to the knowing, and next to
frightful to the ignorant well-meaning People,
and which tended to make the Thing it &s;elf, to
the la&s;t Degree, odious to the whole Nation.</P>
<P>It was fir&s;t &s;et up in the Chappel Royal at
<HI>Halyrood-Hou&s;e,</HI> where none being obliged to
go but the King's Servants, it being no paro|chial

was not impo&s;ed upon them, they concerned
them&s;elves the le&s;s about it; but this was on|ly
an Introduction to the re&s;t, and the u&s;ing i$
there was to make it a little familiar to the
Citizens, who flocked thither to &s;atisfie their
Curio&s;ity. But this was upon a wrong &s;uppo&s;|tion,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) That as the Fox, by often &s;eeing

people were acquainted with this Innovation, the
more they would like it; whereas on the contrary
the more the People &s;aw this Service perform'd
<PB N="179" REF="182">

them.</P>
<P>It was on the <HI>23d</HI> of <HI>July</HI> 1637, when the
Dean of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> appointed to preach in the
great Church in that City, and re&s;olved before
Sermon, in his Habit and Surplice, to read
the Service-Book, as he had done before in the
Royal Chappel.</P>
<P>There was a great Concour&s;e of People in the
Church, expecting what would be the End of
this Matter, and &s;ome Guards were placed at
Hand, to prevent any Di&s;order in the Town;
but no one expected any Thing like that which
happened, neither could it be &s;u&s;pected, or was
there ever afterward any Ground to believe
that any Thing was concerted before, except
that it was in the Appointment of divine Pro|vidence,
to bring forth what follow'd by the&s;e
unfore&s;een Accidents.</P>
<P>The Hour of Service being come, the Dean,
in his Surplice, comes out of the Ve&s;try, the
people gazing as at a great Show, and making
Ge&s;tures of Contempt enough, but no Noi&s;e or
Di&s;order; he pa&s;&s;es through the Croud to the
Reading-Desk, and began to read, the People
&s;till continuing quiet, when, on a &s;udden, at
&s;ome Words that di&s;gu&s;ted her, an old Wo|man,
in a Rage, &s;tarts up, <HI>VILLAIN,</HI>
&s;ays &s;he, <HI>do&s;t thou &s;ay the Ma&s;s at my</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>My Ear.</HI></NOTE> L&V;G,

&s;he drives it full at his Head, rai&s;ing a mo&s;t
hideous Noi&s;e in the Church by it: Some that
at next her, following her Example, did the
like, till, in a Word, the whole Church was
<PB N="180" REF="183">
in an Uproar, and the Dean fain to come down
out of the Desk, and pull off his Surplice, for
fear of being torn in Pieces; the Bi&s;hop of
<HI>Edinburgh,</HI> being pre&s;ent, went up into the Pul|pit,
and beckning for Silence, offered to &s;peak;
but it was all to no purpo&s;e, neither did they
&s;pare; but Sticks, Stools, and any Thing that
came to Hand, flew at him, from all Quarters,
till at la&s;t both Bi&s;top and Dean were obliged
to give over, and retire into the Ve&s;try.</P>
<P>The Lord Chancellor call'd to the Magi&s;trates,
to come down and appea&s;e the People, but it
was all ineffectual; for, by this Time, the Tu|mult
was as great without as within, and
Showers of Stones, Sticks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> a&s;&s;aulted the
Church-Windows from the Street.</P>
<P>Nor did it end here; for the Multitude en|crea&s;ing,
went to all the Churches where the
Curates had de&s;igned to read the Service-Book,
and &s;et all in an Uproar in every Quarter of
the City.</P>
<P>The Dean and Clergy, in the great Church,
with the Magi&s;trates and the Courtiers, having
gotten rid of the Rabble for a while lock'd
them&s;elves in, and went on with their Liturgy
by them&s;elves; but the Mob, who waited for
them in the Street, a&s;&s;aulted the Bi&s;hop as he
came out, and it was not without Difficulty
that he got &s;afe to the Palace.</P>
<P>This was the Beginning, and at that Time
it went no farther; the Care of the Magi&s;trates,
and Power of the Court, overawing the Croud.
But the Harve&s;t being over, and People more at
Lei&s;ure, it was &s;oon found that the Generality of

<P>The very next Day after this, the Mob ga|thered
in <HI>Edinburgh</HI> to a prodigious Multitude,
and there is no doubt but that whatever it
was before, this-new Tumult was concerted a|mong
tho&s;e Gentlemen who had petition'd, as
above; nor was it long 'ere they publickly ap|peared
with and at the Head of them in the Street.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="185">
The fir&s;t Thing the People did, they &s;urround|ed
the Council-Hou&s;e, the Privy-Council be|ing
&s;itting, and demanded a better An&s;wer to
their Petition, and that the Service-Book be laid
a&s;ide till the King was fully informed of the
Matter: The Bi&s;hop of <HI>Galloway,</HI> going to the
Council, was a&s;&s;aulted in the Street, tho' with
Words only, and followed to the Door: The
Earl of <HI>Traquair</HI> had the &s;ame Fate, as had al|&s;o
the Lord Trea&s;urer. The la&s;t was indeed
in&s;ulted particularly, and his WHITE-STAFF
taken away in the Street.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame Time another Part of the Rab|ble
be&s;et the Magi&s;trates of the City and the
Town-Council, and demanded of them to join
with them in oppo&s;ing the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liturgy or
Service-Book, and threatning to pull them out
by the Heels, they obliged them to draw up a
Paper, and &s;ign it, engaging not to permit the
idolatrous Service-Book, &s;o they then termed it,
to be read in any Place within their Bounds,
and to recal their bani&s;hed Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>It was in vain, that the Lords, in the Privy-Council-Chamber,
&s;ent Expre&s;&s;es to the Town-Council-Hou&s;e
to the Magi&s;trates, to come and
re&s;cue them; who could only make Return, by
telling, that they were in the &s;ame Condition, and
what they had been obliged to do: The Lords
had then no Remedy but to &s;end to &s;ome of
the better Sort of tho&s;e of the other Side, to
come and relieve them: Upon this Reque&s;t,
&s;everal Lords and Gentlemen, of good Quality,
of tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed the Service-Book, came
and &s;poke to the People, and de&s;ired them to left
the Bi&s;hops and Lords quietly depart.</P>
<P>To the&s;e the People immediately yielded, and
they guarded their Enemies to their own Hou&s;e
<PB N="183" REF="186">
through the Rabble. And now it was ea&s;ie
for them to &s;ee that the People were no more
to be impo&s;ed upon; for the very next Day a
Petition was pre&s;ented to the Privy Council a|gain&s;t
the Service-Book: And this was not a
Petition of the Rabble; but &s;ign'd by Nineteen
Noblemen, Three Hundred Gentlemen, of good
Note, and by the principal Inhabitants of the
City of <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>
<P>This Petition was &s;ent up to the King, but no
favourable An&s;wer was obtained; but to &s;hew
the Re&s;entment of the Court again&s;t the Citi|zens
of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> the Se&s;&s;ion was removed to
<HI>Sterling,</HI> by Proclamation; and another was pub|li&s;hed,
to forbid all tumultuous Re&s;orts or
Meetings, on Pain of Rebellion.</P>
<P>This &s;erv'd to unite the People, who, ha|ving
made them&s;elves obnoxious, by appearing
in the&s;e Things, were obliged, for their own
Security, to go thorough with their Work; and
therefore taking no more Notice of the Coun|cil
than as Enemies that did them ill Offices
with the King, and re&s;olving to defend their
Liberties at whatever Hazard, they now began
to form them&s;elves, and to con&s;ider their
Strength, the Generality of the Nation being
really on their Side: In the fir&s;t Place, the
Earl of <HI>Hume,</HI> the Lord <HI>Lynd&s;ay,</HI> and A|bundance
of Lords and Gentlemen drew up a
Prote&s;tation, under their Hands, again&s;t the&s;e
proclamations, and having &s;ent it to the Coun|cil,
they from that, Time met in a Body, <HI>de die
in diem,</HI> to con&s;ider the State of the Nation.</P>
<P>Here the famous <HI>TABLES</HI> were formed, of
which our Hi&s;tories are &s;o full; by the Order
of which every Degree &s;at by them&s;elves. (1.)
the Nobility. (2.) The Gentlemen. (3.) The
<PB N="184" REF="187">
Burroughs. (4.) The Mini&s;ters. And yet all
communicated their Re&s;olves; &s;o that every
Thing was done with Unanimity and Agree|ment.</P>
<P>They were no &s;ooner put into this Po&s;ture,
but being &s;ure of the Concurrence of the Peo|ple,
they took no Notice any more of the per|&s;ecuting
Council; no, nor of the King him&s;elf
as to his Menaces or Mi&s;&s;ions; but taking the
Admini&s;tration &s;o far into their Hands, they
proceeded to redre&s;s the Grievances of the State.</P>
<P>They began, <HI>a Jove principium,</HI> with the Re&s;toration
of the Church: All the Epi&s;copal Pomp
and Ceremony vani&s;h'd at once: The Bi&s;hop;
&s;tood at Gaze, or fled, not daring to &s;hew their
per&s;ecuting Faces, and the Meeting of the ge|neral
<HI>TABLE</HI> renewed the ancient Confe&s;&s;ion of
Faith and Presbyterian Church-Government, en|tring
into a &s;olemn <HI>COVENANT,</HI> one with an|other,
to defend and pre&s;erve the &s;aid Profe&s;&s;ion
of the true Prote&s;tant reformed Religion, and
likewi&s;e the Per&s;on of the King.</P>
<P>The King had a particular Account of
all the&s;e Things laid before him, and they
were let to know that his Maje&s;ty re&s;ented it
highly, which was nothing more or le&s;s than
to animate them in the Pro&s;ecution of their
New Undertaking.</P>
<P>They proceeded therefore with all the Re&s;o|lution
and Vigour po&s;&s;ible, to &s;ettle and e&s;ta|bli&s;h
the Liberties and Con&s;titution, both of
Church and State; and that in &s;uch a Manner
as not to be again &s;upplanted or di&s;appointed by
their Enemies. In order to this the impri&s;on|ed
Mini&s;ters were every where &s;et free, the
Bani&s;hed called home, and all re&s;tored to their
Livings, to the inexpre&s;&s;ible Joy of the people
<PB N="185" REF="188">
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who forbare not, upon all Occa&s;i|ons,
to expre&s;s their Dete&s;tation of the Inno|vations
which had been put upon them before.</P>
<P>It would take up a long Hi&s;tory by it &s;elf
to record the re&s;tle&s;s Endeavours of the Bi|&s;hops,
and their Dependants; as al&s;o the Epi&s;|copal
Clergy in <HI>England,</HI> by any Means to bring
them&s;elves in again; but alas! there was not
the lea&s;t Room to thru&s;t the Notion of it
into the Peoples Heads: They were every
where overjoyed to &s;ee their poor bani&s;hed
Mini&s;ters return, the Church re&s;tored to her
Liberties, and to enjoy her General A&s;&s;em|blies,
regular Judicatories, publick Communions,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> without Di&s;turbance, as before.</P>
<P>The other Party had but one Way left,
which was to provoke the King to the high|e&s;t
Re&s;entment, SO to embark the Power of
<HI>England,</HI> in Support of that Re&s;entment, and
to bring down a formidable Army to cha|&s;ti&s;e
them as Rebels again&s;t his Royal Au|thority.
This they threatned the Covenanters
with, <HI>&s;o the Presbyterians were then called in</HI> En|gland,
<HI>becau&s;e of the Covenant taken, as above.</HI></P>
<P>It was certain, that a King of <HI>England</HI> at the
Head of all the Powers of that oppulent Na|tion,
was a mo&s;t formidable Thing; and as
the King had Troops ready about him, the&s;e
People perfectly naked, unprovided, undi&s;ci|plin'd,
and the like; the Re&s;entment of the
King was the more terrible, and it occurr'd
often from <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Words, That <HI>the Wrath of a
King is like the roaring of a Lion.</HI></P>
<P>But the covenanted Lords, far from being
di&s;maid at all the&s;e Threats, &s;tood boldly to
what they had done; and when the Marque&s;s
of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> whom the King &s;ent to them, pro|po&s;ed
<PB N="186" REF="189">
po&s;ed Two Things, their An&s;wer will &s;uffici|ently
acquaint us, that they acted as Men un|der
no Apprehen&s;ions of the Power of their
Enemies.</P>
<P>The Marque&s;s, ve&s;ted with the Power of
High Commi&s;&s;ioner to &s;ettle the Peace, entred
into a Treaty with them on Two Heads, (<HI>viz.</HI>)</P>
<Q><P>1. What it was they expected from the King,
in Satisfaction of their Grievances.</P>
<P>2. Whether they would, after &s;uch Satisfacti|on,
return to their Obedience, and renounce
their Covenant.</P></Q>
<P><HI>To the fir&s;t they an&s;wered,</HI> They expected a
free Parliament, and a legal General A&s;&s;embly
and to that they were willing to refer all their De|mands
<HI>To the &s;econd,</HI> That they had not for&s;aken
their Obedience, and therefore needed no Terms of
Return; but that as to their Covenant, they would
as &s;oon renounce their Bapti&s;m: Nor would they en|ter
into any Treaty, if it were mentioned to them a
&s;econd Time.</P>
<P>There were long and tedious Debates be|tween
them upon the&s;e Things, and many Ex|pedients
the Commi&s;&s;ioner offered, in the King's
Name, to keep, if po&s;&s;ible, the Bi&s;hops in their
Seats. He went back to the King, return'd a|gain
with new Conce&s;&s;ions He offer'd a Decla|ration
from the King, con&s;i&s;ting of Eleven
Heads, all granting Things to the Covenanters,
which they would have rejoic'd at a little be|fore;
but now rejected. In this Declaration.
The King granted,</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="190">
1. To annul the Service-Book.</P>
<P>2. The Book of Canons.</P>
<P>3. The high Commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>4. The Five Articles of <HI>Perth.</HI></P>
<P>5. That all Per&s;ons, whether Eccle&s;ia&s;tical
or Civil, &s;hould be liable to Cen&s;ure of
the Parliament and General A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>6. That no Oath be impo&s;ed upon Mini|&s;ters
at their Entry; but what was
contain'd in the Act of Parliament.</P>
<P>7. That the ancient Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith
&s;hould be renewed, and &s;ub&s;cribed as it
was in his Father's Reign, with the
Band thereto annex'd.</P>
<P>8. That a General A&s;&s;embly be holden at
<HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> the 21&s;t of <HI>May.</HI></P>
<P>9. And a Parliament at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> the <HI>14th</HI>
of <HI>May</HI> after.</P>
<P>10. That therein a general Pardon of all
Offences &s;hall be granted.</P>
<P>11. That he will appoint a general Fa&s;t.</P>
<P>The&s;e were great Things; but as the main
Thing was left behind, <HI>viz.</HI> That Epi&s;copacy
was left in the Church, the Bi&s;hops to remain
and to &s;it in Parliament, and tho&s;e Things left
to the King's Nomination, which, of Right,
belong'd to the Church nothing could be done:
They prote&s;ted again&s;t the&s;e Conce&s;&s;ions, as
King-Craft, to delude them and claiming the
Right to call a General A&s;&s;embly them&s;elves,
as by Act of Parliament <HI>formerly mentioned,</HI> then
in Force: They rejected any Accommodation
without a perfect re&s;toring the Church of <HI>Scot|land</HI>
to all her Powers and Privileges, and the
total aboli&s;hing Epi&s;copacy in that Nation;
choo&s;ing to run all Hazards, and to put Things
<PB N="188" REF="191">
to the la&s;t Extremity, rather than abate one
Tittle of it.</P>
<P>Such Zeal and &s;uch Faithfulne&s;s to the Prin|ciple
they profe&s;s'd, could not fail to prompt
them to all proper Means to &s;upport what they
had undertaken; wherefore the Marque&s;s of
<HI>Hamilton</HI> being gone back in Di&s;gu&s;t, and ha|ving
u&s;ed &s;ome threatning Speeches at his part|ing,
they re&s;olved not to be &s;urpriz'd; but im|mediately
to put them&s;elves in a Po&s;ture of
Defence, that they might be able to go tho|rough
with what they had undertaken.</P>
<P>Accordingly they began to lay Taxes for rai|&s;ing
Money, gave out Commi&s;&s;ions for levying
12 Regiments of Foot and 8 Regiments of
Hor&s;e, making iu all 18000 Men, &s;ent over in|to
<HI>Sweden,</HI> and the low Countries, to invite
home the old experienced Generals and Officers
of their Nation, whom they could confide in, to
come and take Pay in the Service of their
Country, and in a Word, made all nece&s;&s;ary Pre|parations
of War.</P>
<P>As this arming in <HI>Scotland</HI> was not without
very good Intelligence from England, of the
Resolutions taken there to reduce them by
Force, and the Threats of the Marque&s;s of
<HI>Hamilton</HI> to their Faces, when he went from
them, who told them, in&s;ulting, <HI>That they ma&s;t
not think to u&s;e their Kings now as they did for|merly,
when they were only Kings of Rebels; that
the King had another loyal and warlike Nation at
his Command, and that they &s;hould &s;oon feel it to
their Co&s;t.</HI> As, I &s;ay, the&s;e Things went before
their arming, the English Hi&s;torians are mani|fe&s;tly
partial, who &s;ay the King armed only in
his own Defence, and in charging the <HI>Scots</HI>
with a De&s;ign to begin the War; it being ma|nife&s;t
<PB N="189" REF="192">
they were capable of no other De&s;ign than
of &s;ecuring them&s;elves again&s;t being trampled
on by a bigotted Court and an incens'd Clergy.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o evident, that this Vigilance was, un|der
God, the Means of their Pre&s;ervation; for
that when the King advanc'd forwards to <HI>York,</HI>
and from thence to the Border, they were rea|dy
in the Field before him, and that with &s;uch
a re&s;olute Countenance, as that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Army cared not to attack them; and when the
Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> General of the Hor&s;e to the
King, advanc'd in a Bravado with a &s;trong
Brigade of Hor&s;e and a. Detachment of Foot, he
was driven back fa&s;ter than he came, by half the
Number of the Scots Cavalry, with Musketeers in
their Intervals; a Manner of fighting which the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had not &s;een, and which &s;ome <HI>Scots</HI> Of|ficers
had learn'd under the great <HI>Gu&s;tavus A|delplus;</HI>
it would make too much Sport with
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Courage and Bravery, which is &s;o
well confirmed in the World, to give an Ac|count
how like Scoundrels this Army behaved.
An <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hi&s;torian of Note &s;ays, in a Manu&s;cript
which I have &s;een, they were rai&s;ed by the
Clergy, and Imitated their Ma&s;ters; for as the
Clergy, who prompt'd this War, accompanied
the King to <HI>York,</HI> but left him when he came
into the Field; &s;o the raw and undi&s;ciplin'd
Army accompanied him to the Field, but left
him when they &s;hould have engaged; in a Word,
none of the Troops, after the fir&s;t Skirmi&s;h,
car'd to engage, or to look the <HI>Scots</HI> in the Face;
who, on the other Hand, tho' they would not
attack the King, yet &s;tood ready, and &s;hewed
all the Forwardne&s;s in the World to give Battle.</P>
<P>The King's Generals finding the Di&s;po&s;ition
of their Men, told the King very plainly, it
<PB N="190" REF="193">
was not his be&s;t Way to engage: Upon which
Notice was given the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, that they
might &s;end &s;ome to treat with his Maje&s;ty up|on
their Demands, which was done, and in
which, all po&s;&s;ible Artifice was u&s;ed to make
&s;uperficial Agreement, that the <HI>Scots</HI> might be
obliged to disband, and &s;o might be &s;urpriz'd
again unarm'd.</P>
<P>However, they made a Pacification, and ac|cording
to the Terms they broke their Army;
but having certain Intelligence from <HI>England,</HI>
of the treacherous De&s;ign, they kept the Officers
and Generals in Half-pay a Practice to this
u&s;ed when Nations put an End to a War with no
very great A&s;&s;urances of pre&s;erving the Peace.</P>
<P>As they had been inform'd, &s;o it prov'd;
for the King, fired by the Clergy, fought Oc|ca&s;ions
of new Quarrels, and declined e&s;tabli&s;h|ing
their Civil and Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Liberties ac|cording
to their Model, and then pretending
the <HI>Scots</HI> had not kept their Articles, denounced
them Rebels both in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>This obliged them to re&s;tore their Troops,
with all po&s;&s;ible Expedition, and &s;o &s;oon were
they completed, the Zeal and Alacrity of the
common People furni&s;hing Men even fa&s;ter than
they required, that they were in the Field 20
Days before the King: And now they u&s;ed no
more Ceremony about advancing beyond their
own Borders, <HI>as before;</HI> but finding no Army rea|dy,
they entered <HI>England</HI> in Order of Battle, and
advanc'd to <HI>New-Ca&s;tle upon Tyne,</HI> before any E|nemy
appear'd.</P>
<P>Here the Royal Army fac'd them, and it was
thought impo&s;&s;ible the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;hould pa&s;s the
<HI>Tyne,</HI> without fighting; but General <HI>Le&s;ly,</HI> an
old Soldier, re&s;olving to put it to the I&s;&s;ue of
<PB N="191" REF="194">
a Battle, pa&s;s'd the River at <HI>Newbourn,</HI> in the
Face of a &s;trong Body of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Army; beat
them fairly by plain Fighting from their Po&s;t,
and killed 300 of their Men; which Action &s;o
frighted the King, and his whole Army, that
they would not &s;trike a Stroke more; but
&s;hamefully retreated to <HI>York,</HI> leaving <HI>New-Ca&s;tle</HI>
and <HI>Durham</HI> in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Scots.</HI></P>
<P>Here began the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Troubles and Civil
War, which, as they belong not to our Story,
I &s;hall mention no farther than to make good
what I ob&s;erv'd before, <HI>viz.</HI> That God &s;o or|dered
it even from the Beginning of the Refor|mation
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> that no Men, or Party of
Men, have ever yet fallen upon the Church of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> but it has been at length their own
De&s;truction; the Church has been like the Stone
in the Go&s;pel, and on her religious E&s;tabli&s;h|ment
may be written, as is upon her Banners,
<HI>Nemo me impune lace&s;&s;it.</HI> Ever may it be &s;o,
and may her Enemies take the Warning, that
they never more make the Attempt.</P>
<P>Now the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> was arriv'd to
her full grown State indeed: Her Enemies were
not only &s;ubdued, but all in her Power her A&s;|&s;emblies
were now reviv'd, the Covenant which
bad been the Band of all this Steadine&s;s, was re|newed,
all her Church-Judicatories were re&s;to|red,
Epi&s;copacy was entirely aboli&s;h'd, and all
her Per&s;ecutors fled; for Fear of falling into the
Hands of that Ju&s;tice which they had before
exerci&s;ed to Tyranny and Oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>A few Words will fini&s;h this Part of her
Story; The King, and his High-Church Army
being retreated, after the Action at <HI>Newbourn,</HI>
it is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the Con&s;ternation they
were in: The <HI>Scots</HI> Army being advanc'd to
<PB N="192" REF="195">
<HI>Durham,</HI> were now entire Ma&s;ters of <HI>England;</HI>
If they had plea&s;ed to advance, nothing could
have &s;tood before them. They were entirely
po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of all the Counties of <HI>Northumberland,
Cumberland,</HI> and <HI>Durham,</HI> and began to extend
them&s;elves towards the <HI>We&s;t,</HI> and as they re|ceived
daily Supplies of Men from <HI>Scotland,</HI> they
would, in Six Days more, have been po&s;&s;e&s;s'd
of <HI>We&s;tmoreland</HI> and <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> there being no
Forces to oppo&s;e them but at <HI>York,</HI> and tho&s;e
under the terrible Appreheri&s;ion of being at|tacked
by bur whole Army, which, God and
a ju&s;t Quarrel being on the <HI>Scots</HI> Side, they
were in no Condition to oppo&s;e.</P>
<P>The King, in the utmo&s;t Di&s;tre&s;t, here &s;um|moned
a great Council of his <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nobility
to con&s;ult what to do; they advi&s;e him to what,
for 14 Year, had been his Aver&s;ion; namely,
the calling a Parliament, and to &s;end to the <HI>Scots</HI>
to treat of a &s;econd Pacification, which they,
in the greate&s;t Pro&s;perity of their Affairs, rea|dily
con&s;ent to: This was the famous Treaty
of <HI>Rippon,</HI> where, granting a Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms,
contrary to the Practice of all victorious Armies,
rating their Contributions that the Country
might not be oppre&s;s'd, and limiting their Ar|my
to the Banks of the River <HI>TEES,</HI> they &s;at
&s;till, waiting upon Providence, and to &s;ee what
would be the I&s;&s;ue of tho&s;e great Things which
were then in view.</P>
<P>I mention this as it concurs with what is ob|&s;erv'd
before, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That this arming in Scot|land
had nothing in it of what the Enemies of
the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> charg'd upon them, <HI>viz.</HI>
Of a De&s;ign again&s;t either the Per&s;on or Go|vernment
of their Prince; but was nothing
more or le&s;s than what the evident Nece&s;&s;ity of
<PB N="193" REF="196">
their Circum&s;tances led them to, in Defence of
their Civil and Religious Rights, which were
illegally overthrown by their Enemies; which
Enemies had &s;ollicited a <HI>FOREIGN AID; for
&s;uch even their own King, at the Head of the</HI> En|gli&s;h
<HI>Forces, was;</HI> to &s;ubdue and de&s;troy them;
nor was their Practice in this Ca&s;e any thing
but what has been practi&s;ed and allowed to
be agreeable to the Laws of Nature, and of our
Country, by both Nations, on &s;everal Occa&s;i|ons,
le&s;s urgent than this, as will, in Part, ap|pear
in this Account.</P>
<P>It remains only to ob&s;erve, that on the Meet|ing
of the Parliament in <HI>England,</HI> the <HI>Scots</HI> being
fairly treated with, their ju&s;t Demands granted,
and afterwards confirm'd, they quitted <HI>England</HI>
in <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1640; intermeddled not then with the
Quarrels and Divi&s;ions which, from that Time,
began to encrea&s;e; but retir'd within their own
Borders, and laid down their Arms, till the Flame
of Civil War, which afterwards broke out in
<HI>England,</HI> involv'd them of Cour&s;e in the Share
of it, which they felt to their great Lo&s;s and Op|pre&s;&s;ion,
on many Accounts.</P>
<P>But the Story of tho&s;e Things not relating to
the Church-Affairs, I pa&s;s over, referring to the
Hi&s;tories of both Nations. I have only to con|clude
this Part with &s;aying, that from this Time
to the Restoration of King <HI>Charles</HI> II, the Church
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> being uninterrupted as to her Eccle|&s;ia&s;tick
Juri&s;diction, &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in her full grown
State; enjoying the full Liberty of her Con&s;titu|tion,
both in Wor&s;hip, Di&s;cipline, and Govern|ment:
In Civil Affairs, their Country was often
involv'd in War and Confu&s;ion enough; but as
to the Church, which is the proper Bu&s;ine&s;s of
this Tract, it &s;uffer'd no considerable Interrupti|on.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="197">
Her next Appearance will be a State of Trial
the Return of her implacable Enemies the Bi|&s;hops
and their Hierarchy, where we &s;hall &s;ee her
again overwhelmed in Blood, and Suffering the
mo&s;t cruel and mercile&s;s Per&s;ecution that ever
Prote&s;tant Church endured: Her Neck being for
Eight and Twenty Years continually under the
Feet of Tyranny and Oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<Q>CONCLUSION.</Q>
<P>From this whole Account, this ju&s;t Ob&s;ervati|on
pre&s;ents it &s;elf to our View.</P>
<P>1. That as the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> reform'd
at fir&s;t from Popery into Presbyteriani&s;m, &s;o
when the Inva&s;ions of Epi&s;copacy, &s;upported by
the Tyranny of Princes, had reduced her to the
lowe&s;t Ebb, yet whenever the Hand of Tyran|ny
was taken away, and the People of <HI>Scotland.</HI>
were left to the Freedom of their own Choice in
Matters of religious Wor&s;hip, they never fail'd to
demon&s;trate, that Epi&s;copacy was their Aver&s;ion;
and that they &s;till retain'd a &s;incere Affection to
the Model of their fir&s;t Reformers; that the
Presbyterian Church was truly National, and
that they would always, by their Choice, em|brace
the &s;ame, both in Doctrine, Di&s;cipline
Wor&s;hip, and Government.</P>
<P>2. That Epi&s;copacy never got Ground in Scot|land,
but by Violence; and never fail'd to exerci&s;e
what Power it had there, to oppre&s;s and de&s;troy its
Oppo&s;ers; being always animated with a Spirit
of Per&s;ecution in the Church, and ab&s;olute Ty|ranny
in the State, as will &s;till more fully appear
in that Part of this Work which is &s;till behind.</P>

<P>&startq;_IN Re&s;pect that the Provincial

in Chri&s;t's Name, holden at St.
<HI>Andrews</HI> the Twelfth Day of
<HI>April</HI> 1586, For manife&s;t Crimes

formally according to the Word of God,
and &s;incere Cu&s;tom of this Kirk, excom|municated
Mr. <HI>Patrick Adam&s;on;</HI> and that
in this General A&s;&s;emblie they take upon
them to ab&s;olve the &s;aid Mr. Patrick from
the Sentence of Excommunication, the Proce&s;s

true Repentance, nor craving the &s;aid Ab&s;oi|viture
by him&s;elf, nor by his Procurators, be|fore
the very Time, wherein they ab&s;olve
him: I therefore for my Part, and in Name of
all the other Brethren and true Chri&s;tians, who
will be participant with me, take God to Re|cord
of the Dealing of that provincial A&s;&s;em|blie,
and this A&s;&s;emblie General; prote&s;ting al|&s;o
before the Almightie, his holy Angels, and
Saints here convened, that I have no A&s;&s;urance
in God's Word to my Con&s;cience, to a&s;&s;ent,
allow or approve this his Ab&s;olviture: And
therefore until the Time I perceive his Conver|&s;ion

him as one ju&s;tly delivered to Satan, notwith|&s;tanding

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Recantation of Mr. Patrick Adam&s;on, Bi&s;hop
of Sr. Andrews, directed to the Synod conveened at
St. Andrews S. Aprilis 1591.</HEAD>
<P>&startq;Brethren, under&s;tanding the Procced|ings
of the A&s;&s;embly in my contrare, and
being now withholden by Sickne&s;s, to pre|&s;ent
my &s;elf before you, that I may give
Confe&s;&s;ion of that Doctrine, wherein I hope
God &s;hall call me, and that at his Plea&s;ure I may
depart in the Unitie of the Chri&s;tian Faith; I
thought good by Writ to utter the &s;ame unto
your Wi&s;doms, and to crave your godly Wi&s;|dom's
A&s;&s;i&s;tance, not for the Re&s;titution of any
worldly Pomp or Preeminence, which I little
re&s;pect; 5 but to remove from me the Slanders,
which are rai&s;ed in this Country, concerning
<PB N="197" REF="200">
the Variance of Doctrine, &s;pecially on my part;
wherein I prote&s;t before God, that I have only
a &s;ingle Re&s;pect to his Glorie, and by his Grace
I &s;hall abide herein to my Life's End.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Fir&s;t, confe&s;s the true Doctrine of Chri&s;tian
Religion to be publickly taught, and rightly
announced within this Realm, and dete&s;t all a|pi&s;trie
and Super&s;tition; like as (ble&s;&s;ed be God)
I have dete&s;ted the &s;ame in my Heart the
Space of Thirtie Years, &s;ince it plea&s;ed God to
give me the Knowledge of the Truth, wherein I
have walked uprightly, as well here, as in other
Countries, as the Lord beareth me Record; un|till
the&s;e la&s;t Days, wherein, partly for Ambi|tion
and vain Glory, to be preferred before my
Brethren; and partly for Covetou&s;ne&s;s, to po&s;|&s;e&s;s
the Pelf of the Kirk, I did undertake
this Office of Archbi&s;hoprick, wherewith ju&s;t|ly
the &s;incere&s;t Profe&s;&s;ors of the Word have
found Fault, and have condemned the &s;ame, as
impertinent to the Office of a &s;incere Pa&s;tor of
God's Word. And albeit Men would colour the
&s;ame, and the Imperfections thereof, by divers
Cloaks; yet the &s;amine cannot be concealed
from the Eyes of the Faithful; neither yet can
the Men of God, when they are put to their
Con&s;cience, di&s;&s;emble the &s;ame.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;<HI>Next,</HI> I confe&s;s I was in an erroneous Opini|on,
that I believed the Government of the
Kirk to be like unto the Kingdoms of the
Earth, plain contrary to the Command of our
Ma&s;ter <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> (as it is;) but al&s;o in Mini&s;ters,
who are nothing, but Va&s;&s;als under him in an
Equality among them&s;elves.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;<HI>Thirdly,</HI> That I married the Earl of <HI>Huntlie,</HI>
contrair the Commandment of the Church,
without the Confe&s;&s;ion of his Faith, and Pro|fe&s;$
<PB N="198" REF="201">
fe&s;&s;ion of the &s;incere Doctrine of the Word, I
repent and crave God Pardon.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That I travelled both by rea&s;oning, and o|therways,
to &s;ubject Kirkmen to the King's
Ordinance, in Things that appertained to Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical
Matters, and Things of Con&s;cience;
whereupon &s;undrie great Enormities have fallen
forth in this Country, I ask God Mercie.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That I taught, Presbyteries to be a fooli&s;h
Invention, and would have had it &s;o e&s;teemed
of all Men, which is an Ordinance of Chri&s;t, I
crave God Mercie.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;<HI>Farther,</HI> I &s;ubmit my &s;elf to the Mercie of
God, and Judgment of the A&s;&s;emblie, not mea|&s;uring
my Offences by my &s;elf, nor Infirmities
by my own Ingine, but by the good Judgment
of the Kirk, to which always I &s;ubject my
&s;elf, and be&s;eech you to make Interce&s;&s;ion to
God for me, and to the King, that I may have
&s;ome moyen to live, and con&s;ume the re&s;t of
my wretched Time, for winning of who&s;e Fa|vour
(which fooli&s;hly I thought thereby to
obtain) I committed all the&s;e Errors.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Whereas I am burdened to be the Setter
forth of the Book, called <HI>The King's Declaration,</HI>
wherein the whole Order of the Kirk is con|demned
and traduced, I prote&s;t before God,
that I was commanded to write the &s;ame by the
Chancellor for the Time, but chiefly by the Se|cretar,
another great Courtier, who him&s;elf
penned the &s;econd Act of Parliament, concern|ing
the Power and Authority of Judicature to
be ab&s;olutely in the King's Power; and that it
&s;hould not be lawful to any Subject to reclaim
from the &s;ame, under the Penaltie of the Act,
which I &s;uppo&s;e was Trea&s;on.</P>
<P>&startq;<HI>Item,</HI> Where it is alledged, that I &s;hould have
<PB N="199" REF="202">
condemned the Doctrine, announced and taught
by the Mini&s;trie of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> concerning Obe|dience
to the Prince, I confefs and prote&s;t be|fore
God, that I never understood, nor yet
knew any Thing, but Sinceritie and Upright|ne&s;s
in the Doctrine of the Mini&s;ters of <HI>Edin|burgh</HI>
in that Point, or in any other.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;<HI>Farther,</HI> I con&s;e&s;s I was the Author of the
Act di&s;charging the Mini&s;ters Stipends, that
would not &s;ub&s;cribe the Acts of Parliament,
wherewith God had ju&s;tly recompenced my &s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;As for any violent Cour&s;e, it is known well e|nough,
who was the Author thereof, and my
Part was tried at the Impri&s;onment of Mr.
<HI>Nicol Dalglei&s;h,</HI> Mr. <HI>Patrick Melvine,</HI> Mr. <HI>Tho|mas
Jack,</HI> and others.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;<HI>Moreover,</HI> I grant I was more bu&s;ie with
&s;ome Bi&s;hops in <HI>England,</HI> in Prejudice of the
Di&s;cipline of our Kirk, partly when I was
there, and partly by mutual Intelligence &s;ince,
than became a good Chri&s;tian, much le&s;s a
faithful Pa&s;tor. Neither is there any Thing
that more a&s;hameth me, than my often decei|ving
and abu&s;ing of the Kirk heretofore, by
Confe&s;&s;ions, Sub&s;criptions, Prote&s;tations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
which be far from me now and ever hereafter.
<HI>Amen.</HI>&endq;</P>
<Q><L>&startq;Your Brother in the Lord</L>
<L><HI>M. Patrick Adam&s;on.</HI>&endq;</L></Q>
<P>&startq;Where your Wi&s;domes de&s;ire to have my
own Opinion, concerning the Book of the De|claration
of the King's Intention; the &s;ame is
at more length declared in the Confe&s;&s;ion,
which I have exhibited already, wherein I have
condemned all the Articles therein contained;
like as by the&s;e Pre&s;ents I condemn the &s;ame.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="203">
&startq;Where you require, what became of the
Books of the A&s;&s;emblie? I re&s;erved them whole,
until the returning of the Lords and the Mini|&s;trie
out of <HI>England;</HI> and if I had not pre&s;erved
them, my Lord <HI>Arran</HI> intended to have made
them to be ca&s;t in the Fire. And upon a cer|tain
Day in <HI>Falkland,</HI> before they were deliver|ed
to the King's Maje&s;ty, the Bi&s;hop of <HI>N.</HI> ac|companied
with Mr. <HI>Henry Hammiltoun,</HI> rent
out &s;ome Leaves, and de&s;troyed &s;uch Things as
made again&s;t our E&s;tate, and that not without
my own &s;pecial Allowance.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;As for the Books which I have &s;et forth, I
have &s;et forth nothing, except a Commentary
upon the fir&s;t Epi&s;tle of <HI>Paul</HI> to <HI>Timothy,</HI> which
&s;hall be directed to the King's Maje&s;ty, and
$word$ no Exemplar be&s;ide me; and I under|&s;tand
that Mr. <HI>John Geddie</HI> got the &s;ame from
the King, and lent it to Mr. <HI>Robert Hepburn&punc; &endq;
&startq;Farther,</HI> I wrote nothing, but only made
mention, in my Preface upon the <HI>Apocalyp&s;e,</HI>
that I &s;hould write a Book called <HI>P&s;illus,</HI> which
(being prevented by Di&s;ea&s;e) God would not
&s;uffer me to fini&s;h, and the little Thing that
was done I cau&s;ed de&s;troy it. I have &s;et forth
the Book of <HI>Job,</HI> and the <HI>Lamentations</HI> of <HI>Jere|mie,</HI>
all in Ver&s;e, to be printed in <HI>England.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;As for my Intention, I am not di&s;po&s;ed, nor
of Abilitie to write any Thing at this Time;
and if it plea&s;e God I were re&s;tored to my
Health, I would change my Stile, as <HI>Cajetanus</HI>
did at the Council of <HI>Trent.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;As for <HI>Sutlivius</HI>'s Book again&s;t the Form
and Order of the Presbyteries, &s;o far am I
from being Partner in that Work, that as I
know not the Man, nor had ever Intelligence
of the Work, before it was done; &s;o if it
<PB N="201" REF="204">
plea&s;e God to give me Days, I will write in
his contrarie.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Prays the Brethren to be at Unitie and Peace
with me, and in Token of their Forgivene&s;s,
becau&s;e my Health &s;uffereth me not to go over
to the Colledge, where ye are pre&s;ently a&s;&s;em|bled,
which I would gladly do, to ask God and
you Forgivene&s;s, that it would plea&s;e you to
repair hither, that I may do it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Moreover I condemn, by this my Sub&s;cripti|on,
what&s;oever is contained in the Epi&s;tle De|dicatorie
to the King's Maje&s;ty before my Book
upon the <HI>Revelation,</HI> that is either &s;landerous,
or offen&s;ive to the Brethren. Al&s;o I promi&s;e
to &s;atisfie the Brethren of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> or any o|ther
Kirk in this Realm, according to good
Con&s;cience, in what&s;oever they find them&s;elves
ju&s;tly offended, and contrare to the Word of
God, in any of my Speeches, Actions or Pro|ceedings,
which have pa&s;t from me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And concerning the Commentary upon the
fir&s;t Epi&s;tle of <HI>Paul</HI> to <HI>Timothy,</HI> becau&s;e there
are diver&s;e Things therein contained offen&s;ive,
and that tend to allow the State of Bi&s;hops,
otherways than God's Word can &s;uffer, I con|demn
the &s;ame.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The Pages before written, dicted by me Mr.
<HI>Patrick Adam&s;on,</HI> and written at my Com|mandment
by my Servant Mr. <HI>Samuel Cuning|hame,</HI>

<Q><HI>Mr.</HI> Patrick Adam&s;on<HI>'s own An&s;wer to and Refu|tation
of the Book, &s;alfely called,</HI> The King's
Declaration.</Q>
<P>&startq;I have enterpri&s;ed of meer remor&s;e of Con|&s;cience,
to write again&s;t a Book, called, <HI>A De|claration
of the King's Maje&s;ty's Intention;</HI> albe|it
it containeth little or nothing of the King's
own Intention, but my own at the Time of the
Writing thereof, and the corrupt Intentions of
&s;uch as for the Time were about the King, and
abu&s;ed his Minoritie. Of which Book, and
Contents thereof, compiled by me at the Com|mand
of &s;ome chief Courtiers for the Time
(as is before written) I &s;hall &s;hortly declare my
Opinion, as the Infirmity of Sickne&s;s, and
Weakne&s;s of Memory will permit.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> in the whole Book nothing is contained,
but A&s;&s;ertions of Lies, a&s;cribing to the King's
Maje&s;ty that whereof he was not culpable:
For albeit, as the Time went, his Maje&s;ty
could have &s;uffered the&s;e Things to have been
publi&s;hed in this Realme; yet his Maje&s;ty was
never of that Nature, as to have reviled any
<PB N="203" REF="206">
Man's Per&s;on, or to upbraid any Man with
Calumnies, whereof there is a Number con|tained
in that Book.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;<HI>Secondly,</HI> In the Declaration of the <HI>&s;econd</HI> Act
of Parliament, there is mention made of Mr.
<HI>Andrew Melvine</HI> and his Preachings, mo&s;t
wrongfully condemned, in &s;pecial as factious
and &s;editious; albeit his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> hath had a
lively Trial of that Mans Fidelity and Truth,
in all Proceedings from Time to Time. True
it is, he is earne&s;t and zealous, and can abide
no Corruption (which mo&s;t unadvi&s;edly I at|tributed
to a fiery and &s;alt Humour) which his
Maje&s;ty findeth by Experience to be true. For
he allowed well of him, and knoweth Things,
that were alledged upon him, to have been
fal&s;e and contrived Treacheries.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;There are contained in the <HI>&s;econd</HI> Act of Par|liament,
and Declaration thereof, diver&s;e o|ther
fal&s;e Calumnies, to defame the Mini&s;trie,
and to bring the Kirk of God in Hatred and
Envy with their Prince and the Nobility, bur|dening
and accu&s;ing fal&s;ely the Mini&s;ters of Se|dition,
and other Crimes, whereof they were
innocent. As likewi&s;e it is written in the &s;ame
Act and Declaration thereof, that &s;overeign
and &s;upream Power, in Matters Eccle&s;ia&s;tical,
pertaineth to the King; which is worthy to be
Condemned, and not to be contained among
Chri&s;tian Acts, where the Power of the Word
is to be extolled above all the Power of
Princes, and they are to be brought under Sub|jection
to the &s;ame.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The <HI>fourth</HI> Act condemned the Presbyteries,
as a Judgment not allowed by the King's Law,
which is a very &s;lender Argument. For as con|cerning
the Authority of the Presbyterie, we
<PB N="204" REF="207">
have the &s;ame warranted in the Go&s;pel, <HI>Matth.
Ch.</HI> 18. where Chri&s;t commanded to tell the
Kirk. Which Authoritie being commanded
by Chri&s;t, and the Acts of Parliament forbid|ding
it, we &s;hould rather obey God than Man.
And yet the Presbyterie wanted never the
Kings Authoritie for Allowance thereof from
the Beginning; &s;aving only at that Hour of
Darkne&s;s, when he was abu&s;ed with evil Com|panie.
As for any other Thing that is contain|ed
in this Act, again&s;t any Order or Proceeding
of the Presbyterie, it is to be e&s;teemed, that no|thing
was done by the Presbyterie without Wi&s;|dom,
Judgment, and Di&s;cretion; and &s;o hath
received Approbation again by the Kirk,
whereunto al&s;o I under&s;tand his Maje&s;ty hath
given Allowance, hath ratified and approved
the &s;ame, which &s;hould be a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on
to repre&s;s all Mens Curio&s;itie, that either have,
or yet would find Fault with the &s;ame.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The <HI>la&s;t</HI> Act containeth the e&s;tabli&s;hing of a
Bi&s;hop, which hath no Warrant in the Word
of God, but is grounded upon the Policie of
Man's Invention, whereupon the Primacie of
the <HI>Pope</HI> or <HI>Antichri&s;t</HI> is ri&s;en, which is worthie
to be di&s;allowed and forbidden: Becau&s;e the
Number of the Elder&s;hip, that hath Juri&s;dicti|on
and Over&s;ight, as well of Vi&s;itation, as of
Admi&s;&s;ion, will do the &s;ame far more authen|tickly,
godly, and with greater Zeal, than a
Bi&s;hop, who&s;e Care commonly is not upon God
and his Dutie, but upon the World, whereupon
his chief Attendance is. Con&s;ider how that
Office hath been u&s;ed, the&s;e Five Hundred
Years bygone, with what Crueltie and Tyran|nie
it hath been exerci&s;ed; ye &s;hall find it to
<PB N="205" REF="208">
have been the chief mean, that hath in every
Countrey &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the Word of God; which
&s;hall be evident to all that read the Storie of
the Kirk. As for my own Opinion, it &s;eem|eth
to be neare&s;t to the Truth, and farthe&s;t
from all kind of Ambition, that the Brethren
in equal Degree a&s;&s;emble them&s;elves under the
Head Chri&s;t, and there every Man di&s;charge
his Office carefully, as he is commanded. And
becau&s;e Weakne&s;s of Memorie and Sickne&s;s &s;uf|fereth
me not at length to di&s;cour&s;e upon the&s;e
Matters, as I would, I mu&s;t reque&s;t the good
Reader to a&s;&s;ure him&s;elf, that I have written
the&s;e, without Compul&s;ion or Per&s;ua&s;ion of any
Man, with an upright Heart; and have deli|vered
the &s;ame with perfect Sinceritie of Mind,
&s;o far as Infirmitie of Fle&s;h and Blood did &s;uf|fer,
as God &s;hall judge me at the latter Day:
And that the &s;ame Reader account, that what|&s;oever
Things are omitted, is to be imputed to
the Imbecillitie of my Memorie, and the pre&s;ent
Sickne&s;s; and not to any good Will, which, I
prote&s;t, was to have condemned every Point, yea
even to the fal&s;e Narration of the Banquet, and
all the re&s;t contained in the little Treati&s;e call|ed,
<HI>The Declaration of the King's Maje&s;ty's In|tention,</HI>
as I acknowledge they de&s;erve to be
condemned by the Cen&s;ure and Judgment of
the Kirk, to the which al&s;o I &s;ubmit my

<P>Here follows the Account which the Epi&s;|copal
Party them&s;elves give of the Proceedings
of the <HI>Scots</HI> Bi&s;hops and Presbyterian Mini&s;ters,
<HI>mentioned in this Work,</HI> before the King at <HI>Ham|pton-Court.</HI></P>
<P>&startq;The fir&s;t Audience was at <HI>Hampton-Court</HI> the
22 of <HI>September;</HI> at which, be&s;ides the Bi&s;hops
<PB N="207" REF="210">
<HI>and Mini&s;ters from</HI> Scotland, <HI>were pre&s;ent the
Earls of</HI> Dunbar, Argyle, Glencarne, <HI>Sir</HI> Thomas
Hamilton <HI>Advocate, and Sir</HI> Alexander Straiton:
<HI>Of the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Dr.</HI> Montague <HI>Dean of the Chap|pel
was only admitted to &s;tay: There the King
declaring the Purpo&s;e for which he had called
them, &s;pake a few Words to this Effect:</HI> That
having left the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> in Peace at his
parting forth of it, he did now hear of great Di|&s;turbances
in the &s;ame; whereof he de&s;ired to un|der&s;tand
the true Cau&s;e, and to have their Ad|vice,
how the &s;ame might be removed. This being,
<HI>&s;aid he,</HI> the Errand in general for which I have
called you, I &s;hould be glad to hear your Opinions
touching the Meeting at <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> where an
Handful of Mini&s;ters, in Contempt of my Authori|ty,
and again&s;t the Di&s;charge given them did a&s;|&s;emble;
and though they were neither a &s;uffcient
Number, nor the accu&s;tomed Order kept, they
would take upon them to call it a General A&s;&s;embly,
and have &s;ince proudly maintained it by declining
my Council and &s;uch other Means as they plea&s;ed to
u&s;e. The rather I would bear your Minds, becau&s;e
I am informed that divers Mini&s;ters do ju&s;tifie that
Meeting, and in their publick Preachings commend
the&s;e Brethren as Per&s;ons di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, which in Effect
is to proclaim me a Tyrant and Per&s;ecutor.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Mr. <HI>James Melvill</HI> an&s;wering fir&s;t, &s;aid,
That there was no &s;uch Di&s;charge given to
tho&s;e Mini&s;ters that met at <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> as was
alledged, adjuring Sir <HI>Alexander Straiton,</HI> who
was &s;aid to have given the Charge, to declare
in his Maje&s;ty's Pre&s;ence how that Matter
was carried. As to the Ab&s;ence of Modera|tor
and Clerk, he &s;aid, that none of the&s;e were
e&s;&s;ential Parts of an A&s;&s;embly, and that the
Moderator ab&s;enting him&s;elf of Purpo&s;e and
<PB N="208" REF="211">
the Clerk refu&s;ing to &s;erve, the Brethren
conveened might lawfully create others in
their Places, &s;o as the Mini&s;ters having War|rant
to conveen from the Word of God, and
from his Maje&s;ty's Laws, as al&s;o coming thi|ther
by Direction of their Presbyteries, he
could not in his Con&s;cience condemn them.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well then, <HI>&s;aid the King,</HI> I &s;hall de&s;ire you to
an&s;wer me Three Things, that I will ask: Fir&s;t,
if it be lawful to pray publickly for Per&s;ons con|victed
by the lawful Judge as Per&s;ons being incom Di|&s;tre&s;s,
and afflicted? 2. Whether I may not be|ing
a Chri&s;tian King, by my Authority Royal, con|vocate
and prorogue, and de&s;ert for ju&s;t and nece&s;|&s;ary
Cau&s;es known to my &s;elf any A&s;&s;emblies or
Meetings within my Dominions? 3. Whether or
not may I by my Authority call, and conveen before
me and my Council, what&s;oever Per&s;on or Per&s;ons,
Civil or Eccle&s;ia&s;tical, for what&s;oever Offences
committed by them in what&s;oever Place within my
Dominions, and if I may not take Cognition of
the Offence, and give Sentence therein? And fur|ther,
whether or not are all my Subjects being cited
to an&s;wer before me and my Council, obliged to
compeir and acknowledge me or them for Judges in
the&s;e Offences?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Mr. <HI>James</HI> an&s;wering, &s;aid that the Que&s;tions
were weighty, and craved a great Deliberati|on;
wherefore he would humbly entreat his
Maje&s;ty to grant them a Time to confer and
advi&s;e together, that they might all give one
direct An&s;wer. This De&s;ire granted, they
were commanded to advi&s;e and meet together
that Night, and be ready to an&s;wer the next
Day. At this Meeting the Earls of <HI>Salisbury</HI>
and <HI>Northampton,</HI> with divers of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
clergy were pre&s;ent. The Mini&s;ters de&s;iring
<PB N="209" REF="212">
to have the Meeting move private, reque&s;ted
the Earl of <HI>Dumbarre</HI> to move the King therein;
and that none but <HI>Scot&s;men</HI> &s;hould be pre&s;ent;
<HI>fearing</HI> (as they &s;aid) <HI>that &s;ome un&s;eemly Words
might e&s;cape them.</HI> But this was denied, and
they warned to &s;peak with that Re&s;pect which
became Subjects. It was believed that the King
&s;hould have begun with the Questions proponed
in the former Meeting, but his Maje&s;ty taking
another Cour&s;e, required them to declare one
by one, their Judgments touching <HI>Aherdeen</HI>
A&s;&s;embly. The Bi&s;hops (being fir&s;t ask'd) did
all condemn the Meeting as turbulent, factious,
and unlawful.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Mr. <HI>Andrew Melvill</HI> then being enquired
made An&s;wer,&endq; &startq;That he could not condemn
the A&s;&s;embly, being a private Man; that he
came into <HI>England</HI> upon his Maje&s;ty's Letter,
without any Commi&s;&s;ion from the Church of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> and though he had Commi&s;&s;ion <HI>in di|cta
cau&s;a,</HI> and not hearing what they could
&s;ay for them&s;elves, he could not give his
Judgment; Sentence he &s;aid was given again&s;t
them in a Ju&s;tice-Court; how ju&s;tly, he did
remit that to the great Judge; but for him|&s;elf
he would lay as our Saviour did in another
Ca&s;e, <HI>Quis me con&s;tituit judicem?&endq;</HI></P>
<P>&startq;Mr. <HI>James Balfoure</HI> being next asked,&endq; &startq;Did
pray his Maje&s;ty not to pre&s;s him with any
An&s;wer, for that he knew nothing would be
well taken, that proceeded from his Month,
and that Mr. <HI>Andrew</HI> had an&s;wered his Mind
&s;ufficiently.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Mr. <HI>James Melvil,</HI> without giving a direct
An&s;wer, began to tell,&endq; &startq;That &s;ince his coming
to <HI>London</HI> he had received divers Letters, and
with them a Petition, that mould have been
<PB N="210" REF="213">
pre&s;ented to the late Parliament in behalf of
the warded Mini&s;ters, which he was de&s;ired to
offer unto his Maje&s;ty, and as he thought, the
Petition would make all their Minds known.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The King taking the Petition and falling to
read the &s;ame, willed the Advocate to go on
and receive the An&s;wer of the re&s;t. And as the
Advocate was que&s;tioning Mr. <HI>William Scot,</HI> and
urging him with a di&s;tinct An&s;wer (for he u&s;ed
many Circumlocutions, according to the Cu|&s;tom)
Mr. <HI>Andrew Melvill</HI> in a great Pa&s;&s;ion &s;aid,
<HI>That he followed the In&s;tructions of Mr.</HI> John Hamil|ton
<HI>his &V;ncle, who had poi&s;oned the North with
his Papi&s;try, and that he was now become</HI> <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> <HI>Northampton</HI> asking what he
meant by that Speech? The King &s;aid, he
calleth him, <HI>the mickle Devil:</HI> And then fould|ing
up the Petition, &s;aid, <HI>I &s;ee you are all &s;et for
maintaining that ba&s;e Conventicle of</HI> Aberdeen?
<HI>But what An&s;wers have you to give to the Que&s;ti|ons
I moved?</HI> it was an&s;wered,&endq; &startq;That they had
conferred together, and finding them to con|cern
the whole Church, they would not by
their particular Voices prejudge the &s;ame.&endq; <HI>But
&startq;you will not I tru&s;t,</HI> &s;aid the King, <HI>call my Autho|rity
in Que&s;tion, and &s;ubject the Determination of
the &s;ame to your A&s;&s;emblies.</HI>&endq; &startq;This they &s;aid
was far from their Thoughts, but if his Maje|&s;ty
&s;hould be plea&s;ed to &s;et down in Writing
what he required, they &s;hould labour to give
him Satisfaction.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Thus were they di&s;mi&s;&s;ed for that Time, an
being the next Day called before the <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI>
Council (for after this they were no more ad|mitted
to his Maje&s;ties Pre&s;ence) they were en|quired,
whether they had in their publick
Prayers prayed for the warded Mini&s;ters, as
<PB N="211" REF="214">
Per&s;ons <HI>afflicted, and Sufferers for God's Cau&s;e?</HI>
Some of them confe&s;&s;ed that they had <HI>prayed for
them, as Per&s;ons in Trouble, and Di&s;tre&s;s:</HI> Others,
that they had <HI>commended them to God, but re|memberd
not in what Words.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The 20 of <HI>October,</HI> they were again brought
before the <HI>Scots</HI> Councill, and had the Three
Que&s;tions delivered to them in Writing;
which they were commanded to an&s;wer &s;everal|ly:
Mean while they were di&s;charged to return
into <HI>Scotland</HI> without his Maje&s;ties Licen&s;e, and
prohibited to come towards the Queen and
Princes Court. The Bi&s;hops and others of the
Clergy that a&s;&s;i&s;ted them, were permitted to
return.&endq;</P>
<P>Having thus given a Summary of this eminent
Story on one Side, it follows to &s;ee how the other
Side relates it.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>No. D.</HEAD>
<P>Here follows the Account which the Presby|terian
Party give of the &s;ame Conference, extra|cted
from the Memorials of &s;ome of the Per&s;ons
pre&s;ent, and from <HI>Calderwood</HI>'s Hi&s;tory of the
Church, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>&startq;Upon the 22d of <HI>September</HI> they were &s;ent
for to the King, and when they came, they
were admitted to the Chamber of Pre&s;ence,
where they were courteou&s;ly received by the
Bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury.</HI> The King came to the
Chamber of Pre&s;ence, accompanied with the
Earls of <HI>Dumbar</HI> and <HI>Orknay,</HI> Lord <HI>Fleeming,</HI>
the Laird of <HI>Laure&s;toun,</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Hamil|toun</HI>
the King's Advocate, Mr. <HI>John Spot&s;wood</HI>
Bi&s;hop of <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> Mr. <HI>George Glad&s;tones</HI> Bi|&s;hop
of St. <HI>Andrews,</HI> Mr. <HI>James Law</HI> Bi&s;hop
<PB N="212" REF="215">
of <HI>Orknay,</HI> Mr. <HI>James Nicol&s;on,</HI> Mr. <HI>Robert
Howie,</HI> Mr. <HI>Patrick Sharp,</HI> Mr. <HI>Andrew Lamb.</HI>
None were &s;uffered to &s;tay within, but the
<HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Coun&s;ellors and Mini&s;ters, except only
that of <HI>Montague,</HI> who keeped the Door. The
King opened up the Cau&s;es, which moved him
to write for them, almo&s;t conform to the
Tenor of the Proclamation, and the Mi&s;&s;ive
&s;ent unto them. In end, he gathered all his
Speeches to two Heads, wherein he &s;aid, he
would be through with them for the Peace
of the Church. The one about the pretend|ed
General A&s;&s;embly (&s;o he termed it) hol|den
at <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> and the Proceedings, which
followed thereupon. The other, how there
might be an ordinary and peaceable A&s;&s;embly
holden, to &s;et all Things in Quietne&s;s and
good Order. They had agreed among them|&s;elves
to give no pre&s;ent An&s;wer, but to take
all to Advi&s;ement. Mr. <HI>James Melvine</HI> was
cho&s;en to be their Spoke&s;man. After he had
expre&s;&s;ed, in a complementing Manner, their
Joy for his Inclination to intertain Peace, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
he de&s;ired Time to advi&s;e; becau&s;e his Maje|&s;ty's
Letter did bear no Particular, neither
heard they of any before that Time. There|after
there was much Time &s;pent, upon &s;end|ing
of Commi&s;&s;ioners from Presbyteries, after
receiving of his Maje&s;ty's Commi&s;&s;ioners Let|ter,
di&s;charging any A&s;&s;embly to be holden
at <HI>Aberdeen. Item,</HI> upon the Proceedings of
the Synod of <HI>Fife;</HI> praying for the convicted
Brethren in Pri&s;on; and upon Mr. <HI>James Mel|vin</HI>'s
Letter directed to the Synod of <HI>Fife.</HI>
For the pre&s;ent they an&s;wered thus much:
Many of the Presbyteries had not received Ad|verti&s;ement
before the Day; the&s;e who had
<PB N="213" REF="216">
received, con&s;idering that there were weighti|er
Rea&s;ons for holding the A&s;&s;embly, than
for de&s;erting of it, re&s;olved to &s;end their
Commi&s;&s;ioners to keep the Day appointed by
his Maje&s;ty the Law &s;tanding, which is the
mo&s;t authentick Te&s;timony that a King can
give, as his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf declared in open
A&s;&s;embly holden at <HI>Dundie:</HI> For the Enemies
were bold and bu&s;ie: Many References, Ap|pellations,
and other Matters were lying not
taken Order with, which could not be order|ed
without a General A&s;&s;embly. The great|e&s;t
Motive was a Fear to lo&s;e the Right and
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a General A&s;&s;embly, which would
expire of it &s;elf, if there were not a &s;et Day
appointed. The Words of the Letter, &s;ent
by the Synod of <HI>Fife</HI> to other Synods, were,
in their Judgment, &s;o conceived, that it could
neither prejudice the General A&s;&s;embly, nor
his Maje&s;ty's Royal Power, nor the Brethren
who were in Ward under his Maje&s;ty's Mer|cy.
They confe&s;&s;ed, they prayed for the im|pri&s;oned
Brethren; and profe&s;&s;ed, they could
not omit that Duty to their Brethren, which
was extended even to Malefactors for their
Amendment. As for Mr. <HI>James Melvin</HI>'s Let|ter,
the King &s;aid, I heard, Mr. <HI>James,</HI> you
wrote a Letter to the Synod of <HI>Fife,</HI> holden
at <HI>Couper,</HI> where there was much of Chri&s;t,
and little good of the King. By God, I
trow, ye were raving or mad; for ye &s;peak
otherwi&s;e now. Was that a charitable Judg|ment
ye had of me? <HI>Sir,</HI> &s;aid Mr. <HI>James,</HI> I
was both &s;ore and &s;ick in Body, when I wrote
that Letter; but &s;ober and &s;ound in Mind.
I a&s;&s;ured my &s;elf, and the Brethren, that the&s;e
Articles, a Copy whereof came in my Hands,
<PB N="214" REF="217">
could not come from your Maje&s;ty, they were
&s;o &s;trange. Sundry of the Bi&s;hops and Com|mi&s;&s;ioners
of the General A&s;&s;embly, that were
pre&s;ent, confe&s;&s;ed, that many wrong Copies
were &s;ent abroad, and &s;ome very odious,
whereof one might have come in Mr. <HI>James</HI>
his Hands. The King, re&s;uming the fir&s;t two
Heads, willed them to advi&s;e upon an An|&s;wer,
again&s;t the next Day.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;They were &s;carce entred into their Lodging
at <HI>King&s;toun,</HI> when they received a Letter
from Mr. <HI>Alexander Hay,</HI> Secretary for the
<HI>Scoti&s;h Affairs,</HI> warning them in the King's
Name to come to Sermon to morrow. So up|on
<HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the <HI>23d</HI> of <HI>September,</HI> they went
to <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> and &s;at in the Place ap|pointed
for them in the Chappel, the King
and Queen being pre&s;ent. Doctor <HI>Buckerage</HI>
taught upon <HI>Rom.</HI> 13. 1. He joined Pope and
Presbyteries together, diver&s;e Times, as Ene|mies
to the King's Supremacy.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;After Dinner, they re&s;olved upon this An|&s;wer
to the fir&s;t Head, which they appointed
Mr. <HI>James Melvin</HI> to deliver. They could not
judge of the A&s;&s;embly of <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> for the&s;e
Rea&s;ons. 1. His Maje&s;ty had indicted by Pro|clamation
a General A&s;&s;embly, wherein his
Maje&s;ty expected a Reparation of all Di&s;or|ders,
in &s;o far as belongeth to the Cen&s;ures of
the Church. If they &s;hould now condemn, or
re&s;olve, having committed &s;uch a Prejudice,
they could not be heard. They called to Re|membrance
his Maje&s;ty's Practice, at the A&s;|&s;embly
holden at <HI>Montro&s;e,</HI> where the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners
of <HI>Lothian</HI> and <HI>Merce</HI> were reject|ed,
upon the like Ground. 2. <HI>Res non erat in|tegra,</HI>
but judged already by the Council: But
<PB N="215" REF="218">
they would be loath to contradict. 3. The
Judgment thereof could not appertain to them:
<HI>Nam quis con&s;tituit cos judices?</HI> 4. Put the Ca&s;e
they could be Judges, and that the Matter
might be committed to them, they could not
do it <HI>indicta cau&s;a, &amp; reis non citatis nec au|ditis.</HI>
But the King took another Cour&s;e,
which was to po&s;e every one in particular,
and &s;o to catch Advantage, if it were po&s;&s;i|ble.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The Mini&s;ters were &s;ent for after Dinner.
The Prince &s;tood at the King's left Hand,
with the abovenamed <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Noblemen, Coun|&s;ellors,
Bi&s;hops, and Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Ge|neral
A&s;&s;embly. The Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canter|bury</HI>
&s;tood at the King's right Hand, the Earls
of <HI>Salisbury, Suffolk, Worce&s;ter, Nottingham,
Northampton,</HI> Lord <HI>Stennop,</HI> Lord <HI>Knolles,</HI> and
&s;undry other Noblemen. Some Bi&s;hops and
Deans &s;tood at the Door, behind the Tape|&s;try,
who now and then di&s;coverd them&s;elves.
Mr. <HI>Andrew Melvin</HI> de&s;ired the Earl of <HI>Dum|bar,</HI>
to reque&s;t his Maje&s;ty that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
might be removed, le&s;t his Maje&s;ty &s;hould of|fend
at any Thing &s;poken in a homely Man|ner
in their Pre&s;ence: But it was not granted.
The King, after returning of the Points left the
la&s;t Day, came at la&s;t to be re&s;olved in this
Particular; whether the A&s;&s;embly holden late|ly
at <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> was a lawful A&s;&s;embly, or not?
And whether the Proceedings of the Mini&s;ters
at it, and afterward, were ju&s;tifiable, or not?
Mr. <HI>George Glad&s;tones, John Spot&s;wood, James
Law, Andrew Lamb,</HI> Bi&s;hops; Mr. <HI>James Ni|col&s;on,
Patrick Sharpe, Robert Howie</HI> and <HI>Lau|re&s;toun</HI>
were fir&s;t asked, and an&s;wered, they
ever damned that A&s;&s;embly, and the Proceed|ings
<PB N="216" REF="219">
of the&s;e Brethren, as unlawful. Then
the King demanded at Mr. <HI>Andrew Melvin,</HI>
what &s;ay ye; whether think ye, that where
a few Number of Eight or Nine do meet,
without any Warrant, wanting the chief
Members of an A&s;&s;embly, as the Moderator
and Scribe, conveening unmannerly without
a Sermon, being al&s;o di&s;charged before by o|pen
Proclamation, may make an A&s;&s;embly, or
not? He an&s;wered to the fir&s;t Objection thus;
That in an A&s;&s;embly of the Servants of Chri&s;t,
whereof the Number is not pre&s;cribed by a
Law, it is not lawful for any to di&s;allow there|of
for the Number, &s;eeing two or three (which
is the &s;malle&s;t Number) conveened in the
Name of Chri&s;t, have the Promi&s;e of his Pre|&s;ence,
who is their Lord and Ruler. Be&s;ide,
Rarene&s;s maketh not Unlawfulne&s;s in an or|dinary
Meeting, e&s;tabli&s;hed by Law and Pra|ctice.
La&s;tly, all that was done, might law|fully
have been done by a fewer Number, au|thorized
with Commi&s;&s;ion, as they were: For
Continuation requireth not full Conventions.
As for their Warrant. 1. They have War|rant
from God's Word. 2. Your Maje&s;ty's
Laws. 3. Their Presbyteries &s;ent them in
Commi&s;&s;ion to that Effect; and therefore ap|proved
the prorogating of the Day; which
was all they did: And therefore the&s;e Presby|teries
were to be blamed, if any thing was
done ami&s;s; and not the Per&s;ons, who were
Executors only of their Presbyteries Will and
Commi&s;&s;ion. To the <HI>Second</HI> he an&s;wered, that
the Ab&s;ence of a Moderator and Clerk were
not <HI>de e&s;&s;entia Synodi:</HI> And therefore the one,
to wit, Mr. <HI>Patrick Galloway&punc;</HI> the Moderator of
the former A&s;&s;embly, ab&s;enting him&s;elf; the
<PB N="217" REF="220">
other, to wit, Mr. <HI>Thomas Nicol&s;on</HI> being pre|&s;ent,
but craving Leave to be ab&s;ent for that
Time, becau&s;e of his weighty Affairs, they
might create others in their Places, according
to the Practice of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as
is to be &s;een in the Regi&s;ter of the General
A&s;&s;embly. To the <HI>Third</HI> he an&s;wered, his
Maje&s;ty was mi&s;informed: For the ordinary
Pa&s;tor of <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> to wit, Mr. <HI>James Ro&s;s</HI> had
a Sermon before the Meeting. As for the pre|tended
Charge, given the Night before, turn|ing
him&s;elf to <HI>Laure&s;toun,</HI> he &s;aid, I adjure
thee, in the Name of the Kirk of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as
you will an&s;wer before the great God, in the
Day that Chri&s;t &s;hall appear to judge the
Quick and the Dead, to declare the Truth,
and to tell, whether there was any &s;uch Charge
given, or not. <HI>Laure&s;toun</HI> an&s;wered not one
Word. Then the King asked, what Rea&s;ons
he had not to condemn the Ministers. He an|&s;wered,
if it plea&s;e your Maje&s;ty to hear, I
have the&s;e. 1. I am but a private Man, come
upon your Maje&s;ty's Letter, without any Com|mi&s;&s;ion
from the Church of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and
therefore, &s;eeing <HI>nemo con&s;tituit me judicem,</HI> I
cannot take upon me to condemn them. 2.
Your Maje&s;ty, by Virtue of your Proclamati|on,
dated here at <HI>Hampton-Court</HI> (which he
then produced) hath remitted their Trial to
the General A&s;&s;embly, expecting Reparation
of wrongs, if any be done: I cannot therefore
prejudge the Church and A&s;&s;embly of my
Vote there, which if I give now, I &s;hall be
&s;ure to have my Mouth &s;hut up then, as by
Experience I and other Brethren have found
before. 3. <HI>Res e&s;t hactenus judicata</HI> by your
Maje&s;ty's Council, whether rightly, or not,
<PB N="218" REF="221">
that I remit to the Lord the Searcher of all
Hearts, before whom one Day they mu&s;t ap|pear,
and an&s;wer for that Sentence: Shall I
then take upon me to contradict your Maje|&s;ty's
Council, and their Proceedings? I think
your Maje&s;ty would not be well content with
it. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> how can 1 condemn them <HI>indicta
cau&s;a,</HI> not hearing their Accu&s;ers objecting
again&s;t them? This was the Sub&s;tance of his
An&s;wer, which he uttered after his own Man|ner,
roundly and freely. Mr. <HI>James Balfour,</HI>
&s;tanding next in Order, was urged to declare
his Mind. He an&s;wered in Effect as mr. <HI>An|drew</HI>
did. Mr. <HI>James Melvine</HI> an&s;wered; their
Proceedings are already cen&s;ured by your Ma|je&s;ty
and Council, wherein I am re&s;olved with
the Peril to obtemperate, either by Obedience
or Patience. If your Maje&s;ty be plea&s;ed to have
it farther judged by an A&s;&s;embly of the Church,
which is our Wi&s;h, I cannot prejudge the
Judgment of the Church. If in the mean
Time your Maje&s;ty will urge me to deliver
my Judgment of the Matter, according to my
Con&s;cience; unle&s;s the Wrongs done to them,
and given in Writ to your Maje&s;ty's E&s;tates,
at the la&s;t Parliament holden at <HI>Perth,</HI> be con|&s;idered
and di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, I would not for all the
World condemn them. A Copy of the
Wrongs we have earne&s;tly de&s;ired of them|&s;elves,
that we might pre&s;ent them to your
Maje&s;ty, with this he &s;tepped forward, and
delivered them to the King in his Hand.
While the re&s;t were &s;porting, the King read
them over, and &s;miling in discontented Man|ner,
he &s;aid, he was glad they were given in.
Mr. <HI>Robert Wallace</HI> followed. He regrated
&s;ome Delations that were given in again&s;t him,
<PB N="219" REF="222">
and then an&s;wered as the former did. Mr.
<HI>William Wat&s;on</HI> was &s;harp again&s;t <HI>Laure&s;toun,</HI>
and laid the Burden of all upon him: But he
never replyed one Word. Mr. <HI>William Scot</HI>
delivered his Judgment in few Words, agree|able
with the&s;e that preceeded. The Advo|cate
craved Licence of the King to deal with
him: But Mr. <HI>William</HI> had the upper Hand to
his Shame. Becau&s;e much Time was &s;pent,
Mr. <HI>John Carmichael</HI> and Mr. <HI>Adam Colt</HI> were
de&s;ired to be &s;hort. They an&s;wered in few
Words, conform to the re&s;t. Their Harmo|ny
moved the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and others to Admira|tion.
In end Mr. <HI>Andrew Melvin</HI> brake out,
in his own Manner, and plainly avowed the
Innocency of the Brethren, in all their Pro|ceedings
at <HI>Aberdeen.</HI> Thereafter he recount|ed
the Wrongs done to them at <HI>Linlithgow,</HI>
whereof he was an Ear and Eye-Witne&s;s. He
laid to the Advocate's Charge his favouring
and &s;paring of Papi&s;ts, his crafty and malici|ous
dealing again&s;t the Mini&s;ters. So that
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> could not have done
more again&s;t the Saints of God, then ye did
at <HI>Linlithgow</HI> again&s;t the Mini&s;ters. Ye would
do God and his Maje&s;ty better Service, my
Lord, if you bended your Forces and Speech|es
again&s;t your Uncle Mr. <HI>John Hamiltoun</HI> a
&s;eminary Prie&s;t, and Mr. <HI>Gilbert Broun,</HI> Ab|bot
of <HI>Newabbay,</HI> who have infected a great
Part of the Country with Popery. But the&s;e
Mens Heads ye have clapped, and &s;hut up the
faithful Servants of Chri&s;t in Pri&s;on; and &s;till
ye &s;hew your &s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the &s;ame
Spirit: For ye think it not enough to have
pleaded again&s;t them in <HI>Scotland,</HI> with all the
Cunning and Skill ye had, but &s;till continue
<PB N="220" REF="223">
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. At which Words the
King turning him about to the Archbi&s;hop of
<HI>Canterbury,</HI> &s;aid, what is it he &s;aith? I think
he is calling him out of the Revelation <HI>Anti|chri&s;t;</HI>
nay, by God, he calleth him the very
Devil. Well bourded, Brother <HI>John,</HI> &s;aid the
King. In end he demanded, what Overture
they would give him for the other Point.
They an&s;wered, their be&s;t Overture was to
have a free General A&s;&s;embly, by which all
Jars would be removed, and quickly quieted.
The King ri&s;eth, and they were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed,
not without great Applau&s;e of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI>
for their Gravity and Boldne&s;s in the Cau&s;e
of God. The Truth was cleared unto them,
which before was ob&s;cured by Mi&s;reports.
What was omitted by one, was remembred by
another, every one of them having a pretty
Space to advi&s;e upon his An&s;wer.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;When the Mini&s;ters were gone out of the
Palace, and a little on their Way to <HI>King|&s;toun,</HI>
Mr. <HI>Alexander Hay</HI> &s;ent for them, read|eth
to them a Charge from the King, not to
return to <HI>Scotland,</HI> nor to come near the <HI>King's,
Queen's,</HI> or <HI>Princes</HI> Court, without &s;pecial Li|cence
and calling for.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Upon the 24. of <HI>September,</HI> M. <HI>Alexander Hay</HI>
willed them to return to Court with all conve|nient
&s;peed. When they came, he &s;hewed to
Mr. <HI>James Melvine,</HI> that he was directed by his
Maje&s;ty to crave his Sub&s;cription to the Sheet
of Paper, which was given-in by him to his
Maje&s;ty concerning the Cau&s;e, and Manner of
the Delivery. So he gave him it to peru&s;e,
which being done Mr. <HI>James</HI> wrote the An|&s;wer,
and Manner of the Delivery of them in
the Kings Hand. Within an Hour after, the
<PB N="221" REF="224">
Earle of <HI>Glencarne</HI> and Mr. <HI>John Gordoun</HI> came
to them, directed from the King, de&s;iring
their An&s;wer in Writ, and &s;ub&s;cribed, to his
Que&s;tion; what the King may do in Matters
Eccle&s;ia&s;tical? And whether or not he had
wholly the Power of conveening and di&s;charg|ing
of A&s;&s;emblies? They craved the Que&s;tion
to be &s;et down in Writ, and &s;ub&s;cribed as
from his Maje&s;ty, and &s;ufficient Time to ad|vi&s;e,
and &s;o the Matter de&s;erted at that
Time.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Upon the 28. of <HI>September,</HI> they were again
written for to come to Court. The End was
to hear Doctor <HI>Andrews</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Exce&s;ter,</HI>
who, teaching upon the <HI>Tenth</HI> of <HI>Numbers,</HI>
di&s;cour&s;ed upon the Two Trumpets, and pro|ved,
as he could, the conveening and di&s;|charging
of Councils and A&s;&s;emblies to belong
to Chri&s;tian Kings and Emperours.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;At Supper, they were again warned to be
at Court, the Day following by Eight a Clock;
becau&s;e the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Council was to deal with
them. But when they came, they were will|ed
by the King's expre&s;s Command, to come
to the King's Chappel, namely Mr. <HI>Andrew
Melvine</HI> and Mr. <HI>James Melvine.</HI> Mr. <HI>James</HI>
warned Mr. <HI>Andrew</HI> by the Way, that they
were to be trapped, and to have their Pati|ence
tried. There they &s;aw the King and
Queen offer at the Altar, whereupon were &s;et
Two Books, Two Ba&s;ons, and Two Candle|&s;ticks
with Two blind Candles. This was a
Day &s;olemnly keeped, in Honour of St. <HI>Mi|chael.</HI>
A <HI>German</HI> being pre&s;ent, &s;aid, <HI>ego nun|quam
vidi talem cultum: nihil hic prefecto dee&s;t
de &s;olenni mi&s;&s;a, praeter adorationem con&s;ecrati pa|nis.</HI>
Upon the Occa&s;ion of this Solemnitie,
<PB N="222" REF="225">
Mr. <HI>Andrew Melvine</HI> made the Epigram, for
which he was afterward troubled.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That Day afternoon, the Earles of <HI>Argile
Glencarne, Orknay, Wigtoun, Dumbar,</HI> the Com|ptroller,
the Advocat, the Abbot of <HI>Lindor&s;e</HI>
Mr. <HI>Peter Young,</HI> the Laird of <HI>Kil&s;yth</HI> conveened,
in the Earle of <HI>Dumbar</HI>'s Lodging. When the
Mini&s;ters compeared, <HI>Dumbar</HI> &s;hewed unto
them, that it was his Maje&s;ty's Will, that the
Council there conveened &s;hould deal with
them &s;everally, and crave their An&s;wer to
certain Heads, whereunto they prayed them
to give clear An&s;wers, for Satisfaction of his
Maje&s;ty, and to go forth, and come in, as they
were called on. Mr. <HI>James Melvine</HI> was fir&s;t
called on, and being demanded by the Advo|cat,
1. Whether he prayed for the impri|&s;oned
Brethren? 2. Whether he allowed the
holding of the A&s;&s;embly at <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> and the
Declinature given in to the Council by them
who held it? 3. Where was his Letter, writ|ten
to the Synod of <HI>Fyfe,</HI> &amp;c. He an&s;wered, I
am a free Subject of the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
which hath Laws and Priviledges of their own,
as free as any Kingdome in the World, to
which I will &s;tand. There have been no Sum|mons
lawfully execute again&s;t me. The No|blemen
here pre&s;ent, and I, am not in our own
Countrey. The Charge <HI>&s;uper inquirendis</HI> was
declared long &s;ince to be unju&s;t. I am bound
by no Law to accu&s;e my &s;elf, neither to fur|ni&s;h
Dittay again&s;t my &s;elf. He de&s;ired the
Noblemen pre&s;ent to remember what they
were; and to deal with him, howbeit a mean
Man, yet as a free borne <HI>Scoti&s;hman,</HI> as they
would be content to be u&s;ed them&s;elves, that
is, according to the Lawes of the Realme of
<PB N="223" REF="226">
<HI>Scotland.</HI> The Advocat notwith&s;tanding urg|ed
him to an&s;wer, with whom he interchan|ged
&s;ome &s;harp Speeches; and told him, that
howbeit he had not &s;tudied the Lawes, as he
had done, yet he had learned his Logick, and
taught it in the Schooles. Will ye not daigne
his Maje&s;ty with an An&s;wer? &s;aid <HI>Dumbar.</HI>
With all Reverence, &s;aid Mr. <HI>James,</HI> if I
might know the Que&s;tion, and have Time to
advi&s;e upon a good An&s;wer. Ye &s;hall have
that, &s;aid <HI>Dumbar;</HI> and de&s;ired him to give
in his Supplication, which the Mini&s;ters im|pri&s;oned
had &s;ent to the King, which Mr.
<HI>James</HI> delivered unto him, and intreated him
to pre&s;ent it to the King, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t it. He
was removed, and the re&s;t were called on by
Cour&s;e. At la&s;t Mr. <HI>Andrew Melvine</HI> was call|ed,
and told them plainly, they knew not
what they were doing; they had degenerated
from the ancient Nobilitie of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who
were wont to hazard their Lives and Lands,
for the Freedom of their Countrey, and the
Go&s;pel, which they were betraying and over|turning.
Night drawing on they were di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Upon the <HI>Thirty</HI> of <HI>September,</HI> they were a|gain
called on to Sermon. Doctor <HI>King</HI> had a
mo&s;t virulent Invective again&s;t the Presbyteries,
crying to the King, <HI>down, down with them.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Upon the <HI>Second</HI> of <HI>October,</HI> the Eight Mini|&s;ters
were again called before the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Coun|cellours.
Three Articles were delivered to
them in Writ, whereunto they were called to
give An&s;wer in Writ, every one of them &s;eve|rally;
and to take as much Time to advi&s;e, as
they plea&s;ed, and indeed the chief Drift was
to drive Time, till the Convention at <HI>Linlith|gow</HI>
<PB N="224" REF="227">
were pa&s;t. It was permitted to them to
go where they plea&s;ed, provided they went
not far from Court, and made the Place of
their Abode known, that they might be found,
when it plea&s;ed his Maje&s;ty. The Tenor of
the Articles, &s;ub&s;cribed by Mr. <HI>Alexander Hay,</HI>
here followeth.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;1. Whether they had not tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed their
Dutie, in making publick Prayers for the Bre|thren
in Ward, as being afflicted: And are
willing to crave his Maje&s;ty's Favour for the
&s;ame; &s;eing their &s;aid Brethren abide in ward
for ju&s;t Cau&s;es, and by a ju&s;t Sentence of a law|ful
Judge, &s;tanding unquarrelled and unreduc'd?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;2. Whether they acknowledge his Maje&s;ty by
the Authoritie of his Prerogative Royal, as a
Chri&s;tian King, to have lawful and full Power
to convocat, prorogat, and cau&s;e de&s;ert, upon
ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;are Cau&s;es known to him, the A&s;|&s;emblies
of the Kirk, within his Maje&s;ty's Do|minions.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;3. If his Maje&s;ty by his Authoritie Royal,
hath not &s;ufficient and lawful Power to call,
and conveen before him and his Councel,
what&s;oever Per&s;on or Per&s;ons, Civil or Eccle&s;i|a&s;tical,
for what&s;oever Faults, and give Sen|tence
thereanent? And it all his Maje&s;ty's
Subjectes be a&s;tricted to compear before his
Maje&s;ty and Councel, to an&s;wer, acknowledge
and obey his Maje&s;ty and Councels Judgment,
in the &s;aid Offences? 2. <HI>October</HI> 1606.&endq;</P>
<Q>&startq;The Articles abovewritten, appointed by his

<P>&startq;Upon the <HI>Fourth</HI> Of <HI>November,</HI> Mr. <HI>William

re&s;olved to accept the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Dunkelden,</HI>
bought to him by the King from Mr. <HI>Peter
Rollock</HI> for Twenty Thou&s;and Pounds. They
delivered to him their An&s;wers to the Three

the King de&s;ired them to give-up. They a|greed

<P>_BI&s;hop <HI>Spot&s;wood</HI> in his Hi&s;tory of <HI>Scot|land</HI>
&s;ays, That the <HI>PERSECv;TION</HI>
of <HI>Diocle&s;ian,</HI> was a great means to
farther the fir&s;t Propagation of the
GOSPEL in <HI>Scotland;</HI> which
Per&s;ecution being but in the <HI>South</HI>
Parts of <HI>BRITAIN,</HI> it brought a great many
<HI>CHRISTIANS,</HI> as well <HI>Preachers</HI> as <HI>Pro|fe&s;&s;ors,</HI>
into <HI>Scotland,</HI> where they were kindly
received by King <HI>Cratilinth,</HI> and the I&s;le of <HI>Man</HI>
given them for their Retreat, where he erected
a magnificent Church, and called it, <HI>THE
TEMPLE OF O&V;R SAVIOUR.</HI>
This is &s;aid by be in the Year, 277.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="237">
Like In&s;tances might be found in all the
Tracts of Antiquity from thence to the pre&s;ent
Time, where <HI>Per&s;ecution</HI> has &s;pread and e&s;tabli&s;h'd
the <HI>True Religion;</HI> but no where &s;o eminently, as
the <HI>Per&s;eeutions</HI> of <HI>PRESBYTERIANS</HI>
has done in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>It was with Re&s;pect to the &s;everal Troubles,
Divi&s;ions, Wars, and Interruptions, which the
E&s;tabli&s;hment of the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> met
with, even in her mo&s;t flouri&s;hing Condition,
that the la&s;t Part of this Work was call'd, <HI>The
growing E&s;tate of the Church,</HI></P>
<P>I would have been very well plea&s;ed to have
call'd it, <HI>The compleat, or fini&s;h'd State,</HI> and to
have repre&s;ented the Church in the Perfection of
her De&s;ires, arriv'd to the Top of her own Views,
and in the full Enjoyment of her ju&s;t Privileges,
&s;upported by her own Power, and the Maje&s;ty of
her Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>But the Divine Wi&s;dom which has always
thought fit to exerci&s;e his Church with Tribu|lation
and Affliction, as the be&s;t Foundation
whereon to build her temporal E&s;tabli&s;hment,
had otherwi&s;e determin'd; and all that Strength
which the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> had gain'd in the
&s;hort Intervals of Peace which &s;he had enjoy'd,
in the la&s;t Period of her Circum&s;tances, was
little enough to carry her thro' the fiery Tryal
&s;he had now to endure.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was the Re&s;toration of K. <HI>Charles</HI> II.
brought to pa&s;s in <HI>England,</HI> but the Enemies of
the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> began to lift up their
Heads, and the black Cloud which did but ho|ver
over them as it were for a while, and
threaten'd them with De&s;truction, being big
with Storms and furious Thunders, broke upon
them all at once.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="238">
There had &s;ome Things pa&s;s'd in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Parliament, which had deeply affected the Peo|ple
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and had given them a clear View
of what they were to expect, tho' it was not yet
fallen upon them., and this is what I mean by
the black Cloud which hover'd over them for
a while.</P>
<P>The&s;e were (1) The declaring the <HI>Solemn
League and Covenant</HI> to be unlawful, and obliging
all People who held any Office, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to &s;ub&s;cribe
to the &s;aid <HI>Declaration, 13 Car. 2, cap.</HI> 1. (2) The
Act of <HI>&V;niformity,</HI> and by which the Epi&s;copal
Hierarchy in <HI>England</HI> was re&s;tored, and the Mi|ni&s;ters
who would not conform to the Liturgy
and Ceremonies of the Church of <HI>England</HI> before
<HI>Bartholomew</HI> Day, 1662, were depriv'd of their
Livings, 13 <HI>Car. 2, cap.</HI> 11.</P>
<P>The&s;e were Preludes to what was to be ex|pected
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and yet albeit, the Acts in
<HI>England</HI> were made before tho&s;e in <HI>Scotland,</HI> yet
the Privy Council or Council of State in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
took upon them to begin with the <HI>Presbyterians</HI>
as &s;oon, or rather &s;ooner, than the Parliament in
<HI>England</HI> began there: So that the Church of
<HI>Scotland</HI> &s;aw early what they had to expect; and
thus we are led, without any other Need of In|troduction,
into the Hi&s;tory of Fact.</P>
<P>When the King was re&s;tor'd, the Church of
<HI>Scotland</HI> was in its be&s;t and fulle&s;t Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
Legal Power. The Profe&s;&s;ors of the <HI>Presbyterian</HI>
Doctrine, had by their Adherence to the Royal
Family, laid in as good a Loan of Obligation
upon the Genero&s;ity of the King, as any Party in
their Circum&s;tances could have done: And if
but the Intere&s;t of that Debt had been paid, or,
if Gratitude had been the Fa&s;hion of the Times,
they had &s;ome Rea&s;on to expect a little Con|&s;ideration
to be had for them.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="239">
It was indeed upon &s;ome Expectation of &s;uch a
Return, that immediately, on the fir&s;t News of
the King's Re&s;toration, the Mini&s;ters in Conjun|ction
with &s;ome of the Nobility and Gentry, re|&s;olv'd
to pre&s;ent a Paper to him, which was
called, <HI>A Monitory Supplication.</HI> It was a new
Term, perhaps, made for the Occa&s;ion: And
they did the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> much Wrong, who told
King <HI>Charles,</HI> that it was a <HI>Minatory Supplication;</HI>
for the Contents of it prove the contrary, which
are too long for the Brevity of this Tract, but
in a Word, is contained as follows,</P>
<Q><P>I. A very hearty and &s;olemn Congratulation
of his Maje&s;ty's Re&s;toration to the Throne
of his Ance&s;tors, recognizing his Right, and
extolling the Goodne&s;s of God, in returning
him to his People, praying, that it may be
a Ble&s;&s;ing to his Maje&s;ty and the whole Na|tion,
and alluring him of their ready and
dutiful Submi&s;&s;ion to his Authority.</P>
<P>II. Reminding his Maje&s;ty with great Humi|lity
of his COVENANT Engagement,
<HI>mark that,</HI> to God, and the Nation, and his
&s;olemn Promi&s;es to put forward the <HI>Work of
REFORMATION</HI> in the Kingdom, as
the <HI>only</HI> Thing in which his Maje&s;ty might
expect the Ble&s;&s;ing of God upon his Reign
and upon his People.</P></Q>
<P>This <HI>Supplication</HI> was never pre&s;ented, nay,it
was not &s;ign'd by many of the Per&s;ons who had
promoted and recommended it: But while it was
a meer Embrio the Council of State &s;ent
their Officers, and as if it had been an Act of
Rebellion, &s;urpriz'd and &s;eiz'd upon &s;uch as they
<PB N="141" REF="240">
had Information were concerned in it, and clapt
them in Pri&s;on, having no other Pretence again&s;t
them but this <HI>Supplication,</HI> which they told them,
was &s;editious, and tended to di&s;quiet the Minds
of the Leiges, and render his Maje&s;ty's Govern|ment
unea&s;ie to them. Mo&s;t of tho&s;e they &s;eiz'd
upon were Eminent Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>It was alledged by the Per&s;ons that were thus
taken up, <HI>That there was ho Law against &s;uppli|c$ing
their Prince, and that where there was no Law
there could be no Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; that they had not
acted unpeaceably or undutifully to his Maje&s;ty in any
Thing, and de&s;ir'd to know upon what Law they were
committed to Pri&s;on:</HI> The Council let them know,
no other Law at that Time but their Arbitrary
Plea&s;ure, again&s;t which the poor Gentlemen had
no Remedy but Submi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>And this was the fir&s;t Article of Per&s;ecution
in that Reign (<HI>viz.) Impri&s;oning without a Law,</HI> a
Thing they reduc'd into a mo&s;t general Practice
pre&s;ently after.</P>
<P>The Government them&s;elves acknowledged
the Inju&s;tice of this afterwards by procuring an
Unrighteou&s;s Law, to be made to take away the
Subjects Liberty of Petitioning the Sovereign,
declaring it Unlawful and Seditious, <HI>Vid. 2 Se&s;&s;.</HI>
of the 2d parliament of King <HI>Charles 2. Act.</HI> 2.
by which Act, even Pri&s;oners were deny'd the
Liberty to Petition for their Deliverance; nay,
or a Condemned Per&s;on for his Pardon, or his
Life; a cruelty &s;carce heard of in any Nation
before; which made many good People after|wards
endure the mo&s;t intollerable Cruelties in
their Impri&s;onment, for fear of having them
Doubled by the Crime of Petitioning for Mercy:
But this was but the beginning of the Afflicti|ons
of the Church of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="241">
In the beginning of the Year 1661. the Fir&s;t
Parliament of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. Sate down, and
that they might lay a Ground Plot of that
Bloody Per&s;ecution, which they had re&s;olv'd to
rai&s;e, &s;o they immediately applied them&s;elves
to make &s;uch Laws, and make void &s;uch already
made, as they well knew would be intollerable
to the <HI>Presbyterians:</HI> They knew, the <HI>Presby|terians</HI>
would neither obey the one or bear the
other, and con&s;equently would render them|&s;elves
obnoxious to the Penalties and Puni&s;hment
of tho&s;e Laws, and give the People in Power a
&s;ufficient Pretence for falling upon them, with all
that Violence and Inhumanity, which they had
re&s;olv'd to treat them with.</P>
<P>To bring the Account into &s;ome Method, it
will be needful at once to give a Detail of the&s;e
Per&s;ecuting Laws, as they came to be made, or
at lea&s;t of &s;o many of them, as were made upon
the&s;e Occa&s;ions: And this I &s;hall do in Order
to enter into the Hi&s;tory of the Suffering of
the People in the Con&s;equence of tho&s;e Laws,
the more regularly: And this Method I &s;hall
repeat again, as other and &s;ub&s;equent Laws
were made for the like purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>Some of the &s;everal New Laws, made after
the Re&s;toration, which were the beginning of
the per&s;ecution were as follows.</P>
<P>1. Act Impo&s;eing the Oath of Supremacy: This
was directly contrary to the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Principle.</P>
<Q><HI>Note,</HI> This was the very fir&s;t Act pa&s;s'd after
the Re&s;toration, and it was call'd the Oath
of Allegiance, only to render the refu&s;ing
it the more odious, but it contained al&s;o
the Oaths of Supremacy in expre&s;s Words,
and without the Antient Limitations for|merly
granted. 1. <HI>Act. 1. Par.</HI> K. <HI>Char.</HI> 2.</Q>
<P><PB N="143" REF="242">
2. Act Obliging all People in Office, to ac|knowledge
the Prerogative o$f the King, Note,
this was in &s;uch Terms, as they had then ad|vanc'd;
above and again&s;t all former Engage|ments,
and which they knew Con&s;cientious
People could not comply with.</P>
<P>3. Act Declaring Void, and Di&s;&s;olving the
Obligation of the Solemn League and Covenant.
This the Nation having Sworn to, the good
People could not be convinc'd, that an Act of
Parliament could di&s;pence with the Obligation
of their Oath, in the Sight of God; and there|fore
cho&s;e Death, rather than comply with it,
<HI>Par. 1. Se&s;&s;. 1. Act. 11. Car.</HI> 11.</P>
<P>4. Act Declaring the National Covenant, to
be an Unlawful Oath, and that the &s;ame is not
of any Force to bind tho&s;e that have taken it.
<HI>Par.</HI> 1. Se&s;&s;. 2. <HI>Act. 2. Cha.</HI> 11.</P>
<P>5. An Act not of Parliament, but of Coun|cil,
to burn both the &s;aid Covenants, by the
Hand of the common Hangman.</P>
<P>6. Act to re&s;tore Epi&s;copacy in <HI>Scotland:</HI>
Striking at the Root of the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Church,
and Overthrowing all the Settlement and E&s;ta|bli&s;hment
of the &s;aid Church at one blow.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t Act of the Second Se&s;&s;ion of the fir&s;t
Parliament of King <HI>Charles 1. Anno</HI> 1662.</P>
<P>It may be truly &s;aid, that &s;ome of the&s;e Actscere
not only &s;urpriz'd the <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> but even
fill'd the whole Nation with Horror, partly at
the Unheard of Attack made upon the Solem|nity
of the National Covenant, which mo&s;t People
there E&s;teem'd Sacred, and wondred how their
Temporal Power, or indeed any Power upon
Earth could take upon them to Di&s;charge the
Pepole of the Obligation of an Oath; and partly
<PB N="144" REF="243">
at the Dreadful Things, which they evidently
fore&s;aw would be the Con&s;equence of &s;uch Pro|ceedings.</P>
<P>It is not my bu&s;ine&s;s here to enter into the
Que&s;tion, whether the Parliament could di&s;pence
with the Obligation of this Oath or no, much le&s;s
will I offer, till I &s;ee the Affirmative better proved,
to Condemn the Opinion of tho&s;e, who think
the Nation of <HI>Scotland</HI> guilty by that Act of a
mo&s;t horrid National Perjury.</P>
<P>Having gone this length on the one Side, let
us &s;ee what Cour&s;e the poor People took, who
were to &s;uffer for the lea&s;t Step they took in
Oppo&s;ing the&s;e furious Proceedings.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Thing I find which the Government
laid any hold on, was the Mini&s;ters Preaching
again&s;t them: This was the lea&s;t Thing they
could expect, and yet for &s;ome Time was the
greate&s;t Oppo&s;ition they met with, and which
way to deal with this they hardly knew; for it
would &s;eem exceeding Tyrannical, to Attack
the Mini&s;ters for Words &s;poken in their Pulpits,
which it would be hard to a&s;certain, and again&s;t
which there was yet no Law: Be&s;ides having put
&s;o many hard&s;hips already upon them, it &s;eem'd
very unlikely, but the&s;e lo&s;ers would have
leave to &s;peak, and very hard to deny it.</P>
<P>But they &s;oon got over this: and being re|&s;olv'd
to u&s;e no Ceremony, but to faill upon the
Kirk by all the violent Methods they could De|vi&s;e,
they publi&s;hed a Proclamation, <HI>Di&s;charge|ing</HI>
as they call it, that is, prohibiting and for|biding
<HI>Every one to &s;peak against the Proceedings of
the State.</HI></P>
<P>This open'd a Door to fall upon the
Mini&s;ters, for many of them being Zealous for
the Reformation, and for the Covenant, which
<PB N="145" REF="244">
they believed was an <HI>Oath of God,</HI> and could
not be Di&s;&s;olv'd by Man; could not therefore
in Con&s;cience but declare again&s;t the Attempt
made in the afore&s;aid Law, to &s;et up the Power
of Man, to di&s;pe$&s;e with the Authority of God:
For maintaining this and oppo&s;ing the Act of
the Kings Supremacy, a Thing which they
believ'd was no le&s;s than a Rebellion again&s;t the
Regal Authority of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the only Head
and Government of his Church; Many of the
Mini&s;ters were Impri&s;on'd, and &s;ome without
Hearing, or leave given them to make their De|fence
were <HI>Indicta Cau&s;a,</HI> Sentenc'd to Bani&s;hment.</P>
<P>The Number of the&s;e was Seven at one Time,
they were not indeed &s;ent or Transported to any
particular Place into Slavery, as was afterwards
practi&s;ed. But they were obliged by Sentence,
to quit the Country in a certain Time, upon
pain of Death, and never to return upon the
like Penalty; and accordingly they took Ship|ping
for <HI>Holland,</HI> to the great Grief of their
Flocks, who mourned for the lo&s;s of them&punc;
being left de&s;titute as Sheep without a Shepherd;
but one was &s;ingled out from the re&s;t to bear his
Te&s;timony again&s;t them, in another manner; this
was Mr. <HI>James Guthrie</HI> the <HI>Proto-Martyr</HI> of this
Per&s;ecution, who was Condemn'd to Death, and
accordingly was Hang'd at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> as a Tray|tor;
who&s;e Behaviour during his Impri&s;on|ment
and Tryal, before tho&s;e Tyrannical
Judges, and afterwards at the place of Execu|tion,
might have convinc'd them, that the
Blood of the&s;e Men, would be the Seed of the
Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and that Torments and
Death, would not weaken the Cau&s;e of Religion
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or advance them one &s;tep towards
the Conque&s;t they aim'd at.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="245">
Having now Ta&s;ted Blood, their Fury &s;eem'd
to encrea&s;e, and now in Con&s;equence of the Act
for re&s;toring Prelacy mention'd before, they
advanc'd &s;uch Principles as they knew were di|rectly
contrary to the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Doctrine, and
&s;uch as they knew no Bonds, no Affliction, no
nor Death it &s;elf, would ever bring them to
comply with.</P>
<P>The&s;e were,</P>
<P>1. A Declaration in the Preamble to the Act
for E&s;tabli&s;hing Epi&s;copacy, &s;ignifying, that <HI>the
Di&s;po&s;al of the Government of the Church, is in
the King, as an Inherent Right of the Crown.</HI></P>
<P>2. Depriving the Church of the Freedom of
Calling and Chu&s;ing their own Pa&s;tors: This was
included in an Act for re&s;toring Patronages.</P>
<P>3. Di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the Mini&s;ters, who would not
Conform to Epi&s;copocy, and this without Legal
Pro&s;ecution, by a meer Act of Council, pa&s;'d in
<HI>October,</HI> 1662.</P>
<P>I think it is very nece&s;&s;ary to &s;et down the&s;e
fir&s;t Mea&s;ures of the Per&s;ecutors of the
Church, in Order to remove a certain Slander
rai&s;ed by the Enemies of the&s;e poor Suffering
Chri&s;tians, and which too many good People
are Prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd in this Nation, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that the
<HI>Scots Presbyterians</HI> &s;uffer'd upon Trifling Pun|ctilio's,
not E&s;&s;ential to Religion, or upon
Points which the Chri&s;tian Church have in all
Ages &s;ubmitted to, even under the Government
of Heathen Emperors and the like; &s;uch as ac|knowledging
the King, Swearing Allegiance to
him, living peaceably, paying Taxes, Tythes,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> Whereas on the contrary it is Evident,
that the Sufferings of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
and the Per&s;ecution which her Faithful Confe&s;|&s;ors
<PB N="147" REF="246">
have Labour'd under, have been occa&s;ion'd
for maintaining the E&s;&s;ential Points, both of
Doctrine and Government, which &s;he has held
ever &s;ince the Reformation, and without which
no true Church can be E&s;tabli&s;hed, (<HI>viz.</HI>) Such
as the refu&s;ing all U&s;urpations upon the Sove|reignty
of Chri&s;t, as King and Head of his
Church, in Oppo&s;ition to Era&s;tiani&s;m, and E|pi&s;copal
Supremacy. (2.) The In&s;upportable
Yoke of what they call'd Un&s;criptural Prelacy,
which neither they or their Fathers were able
to bear. (3.) The right of calling their own
Mini&s;ters in Oppo&s;ition to the Pretences of Lay
Patronages, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the like, and (4) for
Oppo&s;ing the Tyranny and Inju&s;tice, of the
Proceedings of tho&s;e in Power, who Condemn'd
Men unheard, Sentenc'd Men at Plea&s;ure,
without Examining into the Facts, or hearing
Legal Witne&s;&s;es; and puni&s;h'd Men to Death,
for &s;uch Crimes as were not puni&s;hable with
Death, by the Laws of the Land.</P>
<P>The&s;e and &s;uch as the&s;e, were the Points upon
which the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;uffer'd the mo&s;t
Bloody Per&s;ecution, that has been heard of in
this Age, or for the la&s;t 100 Years pa&s;s'd in
the World. The Per&s;ecution of the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI>
in <HI>France,</HI> being in proportion to this Country,
and the Number of People, and the Blood &s;pilt,
no way to compare to it.</P>
<P>But to come now to the Suffering Party: The
Government having thus by their Unrighteous
Laws, made way for all the Oppre&s;&s;ions which they
de&s;ign'd, having E&s;tabli&s;h'd Prelacy, and
Di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the Presbyterian Mini&s;ters of their
Kirks, filling their Places with a Race of Men,
who for Ignorance and Wickedne&s;s, were &s;car&s;e
to be equall'd in the World; I mean as Mini|&s;ters.
<PB N="148" REF="247">
The poor People were immediately &s;cat|ter'd
and di&s;per&s;s'd in a Dreadful manner: The
new Set of Men, were &s;o weak in Capacity, and
&s;o abominable in their known Practice and Con|ver&s;ation,
(&s;peaking without the lea&s;t prejudice
of the mo&s;t of them), that the People abhorr'd
to hear them, or to come into the Churches
where they were.</P>
<P>This occa&s;ion'd them to follow their own Mi|ni&s;ters,
tho' Di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;t, into private Places and
Corners, and to hear the Word Preached, and
have their Ordinances Admini&s;tred in private
Hou&s;es and Meetings, as was &s;oon after the
practi&s;e in <HI>England,</HI> by the Di&s;&s;enters here.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;ters on the other Hand, thinking it
their Duty not to for&s;ake their People, kept
them&s;elves Concealed and Retired, and went
from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e, Preaching and Praying,
Vi&s;iting, Baptizing, and in a Word performing
all the Duties of their Office, as opportunity
would allow.</P>
<P>This the Epi&s;copal Party could not bear; and
therefore in the fir&s;t place, fell to their former
cu&s;tom of making Laws again&s;t it in Parlia|ment,
and Enforcing tho&s;e Laws by Proclama|tions,
and Acts of Council, which they &s;oon
brought to be of equal Force with Acts of Par|liament,
tho' by Law it was quite otherwi&s;e,
<HI>Vid. 3d. Act 1. Se&s;&s;. 1. Par. Car.</HI> 11. Entituled
ACT <HI>A&s;&s;erting his Maje&s;ty's Royal Prerogative in
making Laws.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Laws again&s;t Non-Conformity, are &s;o
Extraordinary, and Savour'd &s;o much of a true
Spirit of Per&s;ecution, were in them&s;elves &s;o
Unju&s;t, and in &s;ome things &s;o Unnatural, that
none can wonder if the Execution of them
&s;ometimes drove the poor People to De&s;peration,
<PB N="149" REF="248">
and made, as in far le&s;s moving Ca&s;es has been
&s;aid, <HI>Nature Rebel again&s;t Principle,</HI> and drove
the People, made thus Di&s;tracted by their op|pre&s;&s;ions
to Tumult and Rebellion.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e they have in the&s;e Things, al&s;o
been ra&s;hly cen&s;ur'd by &s;ome among us, as a
People &s;uffering as Evil doers. It mu&s;t be u&s;e|ful
in their Vindication, to expo&s;e a little the
Inhumanity and Barbarity of their Per&s;ecutors;
and this can be done in nothing better than in
giving a Brief Account of the Laws now made;
which they expected, and rigorou&s;ly exacted
Obedience to; and which it was impo&s;&s;ible for
that Poor People to obey, without <HI>making Shipwreck
of Faith and a good Con&s;cience,</HI> abandoning their
Profe&s;&s;ion, Inverting the Rule of the Apo&s;tle,
and obeying Man rather than God.</P>
<Q>The&s;e Acts are as follow.</Q>

&startq;Writing, Remon&s;trating, Printing, Praying or

<P>Now to fini&s;h all, and Enforce the&s;e Laws and
Proclamations, the King Erected a High Com|mi&s;&s;ion
Court, con&s;i&s;ting of a Medley of Clergy,
Nobility, Magi&s;trates and Soldiers. This Body
were Empower'd to hear and determine Cau&s;es,
without Appeal, to Execute Civil and Eccle&s;ia|&s;tick
Authority; they could Su&s;pend and Deprive
Clergy Men; Excommunicate like Bi&s;hops; Com|mit

like Judges; and put to Torture and Death like
<HI>Hangmen:</HI> In a Word, as a known <HI>Scots</HI> Author

&startq;or Accu&s;er, contrary to an Expre&s;s &s;tanding Law,
Act. 13. Parl. 10. Jac. vi.</P>
<P>It is &s;carce to be related, what Innumerable
Oppre&s;&s;ions fell upon the People, but e&s;pecialiy
upon the poor Mini&s;ters, in the Pro&s;ecution of
the&s;e Laws; for the Mini&s;ters finding them&s;elves
bound in Con&s;cience, not to abandon their
Flocks, for any Per&s;ecution or Bodily Sufferings
whatsoever, expo&s;ed them&s;elves freely to the
wor&s;t that their Enemies could do, and failed
not at the greate&s;t and utmo&s;t Hazard, to di&s;|charge
their Duty; and the People Flocking
after them, they Preached to them with what
Privacy and Caution they were able, but at the
Extreame&s;t Hazard. Nor was it po&s;&s;ible, but
that many would be daily falling into the Hands
of their Per&s;ecutors; in&s;omuch, that the Pri&s;ons
were every where full of Faithful Mini&s;ters;
whereof abundance dyed, thro' the length of
their Confinement, and severity of their U&s;age;
&s;ome thro' Cold and Evil Lodging, having Con-tracted Di&s;ea&s;es and Infirmities, and others for
want of Conveniences, and even Nece&s;&s;aries;
who$e Blood is no doubt to be E&s;teem'd, as &s;hed
in the Cau&s;e of Religion, as much as if they had
been brought out to Execution, as &s;everal of
their Brethren afterwards were.</P>
<P>By this Scandalous Judicatory, call'd the High
Commi&s;&s;ion Court, many Innocent Men, as well
Mini&s;ters as others, were pro&s;ecuted even after
a manner, near a Kin to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Inqui&s;ition;
and as an Author well ob&s;erves, having no other
Precedent in the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> World, but the &s;aid <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI>
Inqui&s;ition, being neither &s;uffred to know
their Crimes or their Accu&s;er; never &s;uffred to
come to a Hearing, or to make any Legal Defence.
But when they demanded their Accu&s;ation, or
<PB N="153" REF="252">
indictment, and leave to An&s;wer to the &s;ame,
they were told they could not be admitted to any
Defence, unle&s;s they would fir&s;t take the Oath
by which they were to acknowledge and &s;ubmit to
the Juri&s;diction of their Judges; and then with|out
hearing their Offence, or having leave to
An|&s;wer, they were &s;entenc'd to Scourging, Stigmati|zing,
Bani&s;hment, Tran&s;portation, to Slavery in
<HI>Barbadoes,</HI> perpetual Impri&s;onment and the like;
as the Commi&s;&s;ioners thought fit, and this to &s;uch
a Degree, that the People fled before them, and
the whole Country-&s;ides, <HI>as they are called there,</HI>
became depopulate, for Non-Conformity. As
this High Commi&s;&s;ion Court is ju&s;tly repre&s;ented
to be the mo&s;t Arbitrary, Illegal, Cruel, and
Unju&s;t Judicatory, that ever was &s;et up in a
<HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Nation, and imitated by none, but
the Bloody Inqui&s;ition afore&s;aid, &s;o it cannot
be Unacceptable in our relating the Sufferings of

are yet able to give, and which the Collector of
the&s;e particulars, has receiv'd from the Mouths,
ofmany of the Sufferers them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I have already mentioned, how Per&s;ons were
brought before the&s;e new Judges without any No|tice,
without Information, Accu&s;ation, Witne&s;s, or
Accu&s;er: But being fetch'd in, were in&s;tantly
<PB N="154" REF="253">
<HI>Charg'd by way of Inquiry,</HI> and therefore was it
that this Court was not improperly call'd a Court
of Inquisition. The Arch-Prelate, or Bi&s;hop
of St. Andrews the &s;ame who was afterwards
kill'd, pre&s;iding therein.</P>
<P>Upon the bringing any Per&s;on before them,
he was requir'd immediately to An&s;wer &s;uch
Que&s;tions as were propounded to him, being
allow'd neither Council to advi&s;e with, or time
to consider; if he an&s;wer'd Satisfactorily to one
Que&s;tion, they would &s;till find others to En&s;nare
him; if he refu&s;ed to An&s;wer, and pleaded the
Great Law of Nature, <HI>Nemo tenetur Seip&s;um
accu&s;are;</HI> they &s;et him by In&s;tantly as Convict,
and proceeded to Sentence; if he an&s;wer'd boldly
and perhaps &s;martly, they immediately Sen|tence
him for Contumacy and Di&s;re&s;pect: A
Mini&s;ter was Sentenc'd to Bani&s;hment for cal|ling
the Archbi&s;hop, Sir, And not my Lord.
One Mr. <HI>Porterfield,</HI> a Gentleman of a Loyal
Family, was brought before them, and ask'd
why he did not' come to his Pari&s;h Church, to
hear the Curate; to which he gave them a very
pertinent An&s;wer, <HI>viz.</HI> Becau&s;e the Curate had
abu&s;ed him, and &s;landreds him, in &s;uch a manner,
as was both Scandalous to him as a Mini&s;ter,
and ju&s;t Ground of Re&s;entment to any thing of
a Gentleman. The Court upon his expo&s;ing
and proving the Fact, were a&s;ham'd of the
Curate, but being re&s;olv'd to Revenge it on the
Gentleman, they put &s;everal other Que&s;tions to
him, all which he an&s;wer'd, &s;o as no Advantage
could be gain'd of him, at which the Archbi|&s;hop
being Enrag'd, ask'd him if he would take
the Oath of Supremacy, which when he mo|de&s;tly
declined, they immediately Sentenc'd
him to Bani&s;hment and Confinement, to the
<PB N="155" REF="254">
Town of <HI>Elgin</HI> far North, and Fin'd him almo&s;t
to the full value of his whole E&s;tate; and this
was the con&s;tant Method when any Per&s;on
Conven'd before them, Could no other way be
laid hold of; nor in their Sentence did they
confine them&s;elves to &s;uit the Puni&s;hment to
the Offence, or con&s;ult the Power of their
Commi&s;&s;ion, but frequently Sentenced People to
the &s;evere&s;t Puni&s;hment, for the &s;malle&s;t Offen|ces,
and frequently pa&s;s'd &s;uch Sentences, as
they had no Power by their Commi&s;&s;ion to pa&s;s:
one Famous Example, among a great Multi|tude
is left upon Record, as follows.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>John Leving&s;ton,</HI> a mo&s;t Eminent and
Reverend Mini&s;ter, particularly famous in the
Church of Scotland, had been Bani&s;h'd the King|dom
for no other Rea&s;on, but his refu&s;ing the
Oath of Supremacy; there was Collated to that
Benefice, a Curate or Epi&s;copal Mini&s;ter, one
Mr. <HI>Scot,</HI> who it &s;eems &s;tood Excommunicated
before, and continued under that Sentence;
be&s;ides that, the People had other Objections
again&s;t his Morals and Good Name, in&s;omuch,
that they publickly oppo&s;ed him, at his coming
to Preach; and it &s;eems, there were &s;ome warm
Expre&s;&s;ions u&s;ed by &s;ome of the People again&s;t
him, which he complain'd of to the High
Commi&s;&s;ion Court. Four poor Men of the
Pari&s;h, where hereupon Conven'd before them,
and being not charg'd with any thing by the &s;aid
<HI>Scot,</HI> but being Interrogated, they acknowledg'd
they were pre&s;ent, when the Pari&s;hioners did
declare their Di&s;&s;atisfaction at Mr. <HI>Scots</HI> coming
to their Kirk, but &s;aid, that they did not &s;peak
what was &s;aid.</P>
<P>This the Commi&s;&s;ioners, contrary indeed to
&s;everal of their own Body, Vote to be a Confe&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="156" REF="255">
of Guilt, and immediately gave this Barba|rous
Sentence.</P>
<P>That the Four Men &s;hould be Scourged thro'
the Town, Stigmatiz'd on the Forehead with
the Letter <HI>T.</HI> at the Cro&s;s of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and be
Tran&s;ported to the I&s;land of <HI>Barbadoes;</HI> all
which was rigorou&s;ly Executed: Nor was this
enough to &s;atisfy the Rage of the <HI>Per&s;ecutors,</HI>
even in &s;o trifling an Offence. But a few Days
after, two Brothers, and a young Maiden their
Si&s;ter, Inhabitants of the &s;ame Pari&s;h, were
&s;entenc'd on the &s;ame Account, the two Men
to be Bani&s;h'd to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and the young
Woman to be whipp'd thro' the Town of <HI>Jad|burgh;</HI>
all which Sentences were Executed ac|cordingly.</P>
<P>Two more Examples we have of their Ju&s;tice,
which are very eminent; the One, of Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI>
a Learned <HI>Nonconforming</HI> Mini&s;ter, who was
brought before them for Praying and Preaching
to a few of his Friends, met privately in a
Friend's Hou&s;e; they had, it &s;eems, no Evi|dence
of the Fact, much le&s;s any Thing to
object again&s;t what he had &s;poken.</P>
<P>When he came before the Commi&s;&s;ioners, he
did not &s;peak di&s;re&s;pectfully at all, but he de|clin'd
giving the Arch-Bi&s;hop the Title of <HI>Lord:</HI>
At which, one of the Bench ask'd him very
&s;cornfully, if he knew who it was he was
&s;peaking to, and what Character he bore; to
which he an&s;wer'd, he did know him to
be Mr. <HI>James Sharps,</HI> once a Mini&s;ter, as he him|&s;elf
then was, and that he knew no higher Cha|racter
any Chri&s;tian Man could bear, than to
be a Mini&s;ter, and Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t:</HI>
This he &s;poke, directing his Words to that
Commi&s;&s;ioner who had reprov'd him, and gave
him the Titles he was known by.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="256">
This &s;o enrag'd the Arch-Bi&s;hop, that he
knew not how with Violence enough to wreak
his Malice on the poor Man. But to &s;hew his
Willingne&s;s to de&s;troy him, he &s;entenc'd him,
be&s;ides his Sentence for <HI>Conventicli$g,</HI> as they
call'd it, to be led by the Hangman to the Place
in the <HI>Tol-Booth</HI> call'd the <HI>Thieves Hole,</HI> and there
laid in heavy Irons, there being a raving Crea|ture
who was an Idiot, and furious, confin'd in
the &s;ame Place, and left loo&s;e with him. Here
the godly Mini&s;ter lay &s;ome Days in Danger of
being de&s;troy'd by the poor demented Wretch,
who every Moment threaten'd to kill him. But
God, that &s;topped the Mouths of <HI>Daniel's</HI> Ly|ons,
re&s;train'd him &s;o that he hurt him not:
And the&s;e merciful Judges hearing, that by the
Grate of this Hole which look'd to the Street,
he was reliev'd and comforted by the Charity
and Compa&s;&s;ion of many good People of the
City, many were threaten'd for relieving him;
and at length the poor Man was carry'd away
to a Place call'd the <HI>Iron Hou&s;e</HI> in the &s;ame
Pri&s;on; where none could come at him. Here
he continued cl|ole Pri&s;oner, and in Irons, for
many Days. Be&s;ides this, they &s;entenc'd him
for his private Preaching to <HI>perpetual Bani&s;hment</HI>
to the I&s;land of <HI>Shetland,</HI> the coude&s;t, and mo&s;t
unho&s;pitable of all the <HI>Caledonian</HI> I&s;lands; where
his only Relief, as to this World, was the So|ciety
of other ble&s;&s;ed Sufferers bani&s;h'd thither
for the &s;ame <HI>Good Cau&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>The next In&s;tance of their Cruelty was one
Mr. <HI>Black,</HI> a Lay-Man, charg'd by the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners,
with having been at a Meeting
of a few Chri&s;tians in a private Way, for Prayer;
whether any Mini&s;ter was with them, or not,
was not alledg'd, neither had they any Thing
<PB N="158" REF="257">
el&s;e to charge upon him of any Kind what|ever.
They could not prove his being at the
Meeting; but would have him confe&s;s, which
he declin'd: Then they demanded him to give
them an Account upon his Oath, who was at
the &s;aid Meeting. This he declare'd was again&s;t
his Conscience; and he would not be an Ac|cu&s;er
of <HI>Innocent Men:</HI> For denying this, they
&s;entenc'd him to <HI>be &s;courged thro' the Town;</HI>
which he very patiently &s;ubmitted to, and
chearfully &s;uffer'd.</P>
<P>It would be endle&s;s to enumerate the Names
of the Sufferers in this Ca&s;e, and it has not
been po&s;&s;ible for the Author of the&s;e Collec|tions
to come at the certain Number of tho&s;e
Mini&s;ters, or Others, who dy'd in Pri&s;ons and
Bani&s;hment, upon Account of the&s;e <HI>Per&s;ecuting
Laws,</HI> there being no Record pre&s;erv'd of their
Pro&s;ecution in any Court of Ju&s;tice; nor could
any Roll of their Names be pre&s;erv'd in tho&s;e
<HI>Times of Confu&s;ion</HI> any where, but under the <HI>Altar,</HI>
and about the <HI>Throne of the Lamb,</HI> where their
Heads are crown'd, and their <HI>White Robes</HI> &s;een,
where an exact Account of their Number
will at la&s;t be found.</P>
<P>But, according to the Reports of Creditable
and Impartial People, who, upon our earne&s;t
Enquiry, have from their Memories, as well as
they could, recollected the&s;e Things, and putting
their &s;everal Relations together, comparing
them with what has been made publick. We
&s;hall at the End of this Part give the Calculations
which &s;uch have made of the Numbers of tho&s;e
&s;uffering Chri&s;tians, who falling into, or flying
from the Hands of their Cruel Per&s;ecutors, pe|ri&s;hed
in Pri&s;ons, and went into Bani&s;hment,
without any legal Proce&s;s; mo&s;t of whom pe|ri&s;hed
<PB N="159" REF="258">
by the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es and Extremities they
were reduc'd to by tho&s;e Means. And a &s;ur|prizing
Number it will be to tho&s;e who have
not enquir'd, into the&s;e Things, or di&s;cour&s;ed
with the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> about them; and all
this before the Year 1666. A Time made re|markable
upon the following Occa&s;ion, and to
which Occa&s;ion the&s;e Things have been the
unhappy Introduction.</P>
<P>If the poor People were by tho&s;e in&s;upportable
Violences made de&s;perate, and driven to all the
Extremities of a wild De&s;pair, who can ju&s;tly
reflect upon them, when they read in the Word
of God, <HI>That Oppre&s;&s;ion makes a wi&s;e Man mad?</HI>
and therefore, were there no other Original of
the In&s;urrection, known by the Name of <HI>The
Ri&s;ing of</HI> Pentland, it was nothing but what
the intolerable Oppre&s;&s;ions of tho&s;e Times might
have ju&s;tify'd to all the World; Nature having
dictated to all People a Right of Self-Defence,
when illegally and arbitrarily attack'd in a man|ner not ju&s;tifiable either by the Laws of Nature,
the Laws of God, or the Laws of the Country.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides all this it is evident, that this In&s;ur|rection
was no premeditated De&s;ign, but began
in the Violence of Military Execution committed
by four Soldiers commanded by Sir <HI>James Turner,</HI>
who falling into &s;ome Hou&s;es in <HI>Galloway</HI> without
Commi&s;&s;ion, or without Order from their own
Officers, as Sir <HI>James</HI> afterwards alledged,
were opposed, and driven out of their Doors
by four or five hone&s;t Men of the Inhabitants,
in the ju&s;t Defence of their Wives, Children
and Goods unju&s;tly in&s;ulted and offer'd to be
plundred by the &s;aid Soldiers. The more parti|cular
Relation of this Part is recorded as follows.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="259">
Sir <HI>James Turner</HI> was an Officer of Dragoons
who was &s;ent with his Troops by Order of the
Council, to quarter <HI>at Di&s;cretion</HI> upon the poor
<HI>We&s;tern</HI> People of <HI>Scotland,</HI> becau&s;e there they
found the chief Body of the con&s;tant Sufferers
for, and Adherers to the <HI>True Religion</HI> were to
be found.</P>
<P>This Sir <HI>James</HI> was a Tool to their Minds, a
Stranger in the Country, being an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man,
bred to Plunder and Rapine in the Service of
of the <HI>French,</HI> perfectly void of the Fear of
God, or Man, and unacquainted either with
Religion, or Humanity. He had made three
Inva&s;ions into this Part of the Country, where
his Cruelty and Exactions had been &s;uch as had
almo&s;t &s;tript the Country, not of its Sub&s;tance
only, but even of its Inhabitants, who were o|bliged
to quit their Habitations to avoid the
Fury and Brutality of the Soldiers.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to give the Detail of the
Cruelties and inhuman U&s;age the poor People
&s;uffered from this Butcher, for &s;uch he was ra|ther
than a Soldier; neither is it the pre&s;ent
Purpo&s;e but to introduce what follow'd at this
Time.</P>
<P>The poor People had patiently &s;uffered the
mercile&s;s Treatment this Man &s;hew'd them a|bove
&s;even Months, and thereby te&s;tify'd more
<HI>Pa&s;&s;i've Submi&s;&s;ion,</HI> than mo&s;t of tho&s;e who have
&s;ince upbraided them with <HI>Re&s;i&s;tance</HI> can pre|tend
to; when Sir <HI>James Turner</HI> put an End to
their Patience by the following Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>On the 13th Day of <HI>November,</HI> 1666, he &s;ent
four Soldiers from <HI>Dumfries</HI> where he quarter'd,
to a Town call'd <HI>Damfries,</HI> in the Shire of <HI>Gallo|way,</HI>
with Orders to &s;eize upon a poor Man's
Goods, who, he pretended, to have <HI>broken the Laws</HI>
<PB N="161" REF="260">
by not coming to his Pari&s;h-Church; and if
he had no Goods, to take the Man, and bring
him Pri&s;oner to <HI>Dumfries:</HI> The Soldiers, as
Sir <HI>James</HI> alledg'd after, beyond their In&s;truc|tions,
not only &s;eized his Goods, but his Per&s;on
too; and binding the poor Old Man Hand and
Foot, like a Bea&s;t, brought him out, and laid
him on the Ground 'till they rifled his Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The Neighbours moved with Compa&s;&s;ion at
the Indignity of the U&s;age, and at &s;eeing a
poor Ancient Man lye on the Ground, bound
like a Bea&s;t, to be carry'd away to the Slaughter;
and with ju&s;t Indignation at the In&s;olence of
the four Soldiers, came to the Soldiers, and
calmly entreated them to unbind him, and to
let him go with them like a Pri&s;oner, and like
a Man, not like a Bea&s;t.</P>
<P>The in&s;olent Soldiers pretend to be affronted
at this Motion, and fall immediately upon the
People with their Swords, wounding two or
three. This &s;o enraged the re&s;t, that they
attack'd the Soldiers immediately, wounded one,
and made the re&s;t throw down their Arms, and
beg <HI>Quarter.</HI></P>
<P>This Breach, thus purely accidental, and by an
unforeseen Provocation being begun, the Sol|diers
vowing Revenge, and preparing to fall up|on
the whole neighbouring Part of the Coun|try,
drove the innocent People to the Nece&s;&s;ity
of gathering together, and &s;tanding upon their
own Defence: So that when Ten or Twelve
Soldiers return'd with their bloody Re&s;olution
of Plunder, and De&s;olation, they were likewi&s;e
di&s;arm'd, and made Pri&s;oners, and when after
this Three Troops were &s;ent, they found the
People too &s;trong to be attack'd, upon which,
they cryed prefently, <HI>A REBBLLION;</HI> ds
<PB N="162" REF="261">
and &s;ent for more Forces, which of cour&s;e o|bliged
Others to run in to the Aid of their Bre|thren,
all which was purely ca&s;ual, 'till finding
them&s;elves reduc'd by this la&s;t gathering toge|ther
to a Circumstance which <HI>&s;tay</HI> or <HI>go,</HI> would be
fatal to them if they fell into the Hands of the Go|vernment,
they law no Remedy but to &s;tand to it,
and inviting all the Injur'd and Oppre&s;s'd People
to joyn with them, they declar'd <HI>for Liberty and
the Kirk of</HI> Scotland; upon this, marching to <HI>Dum|fries,</HI>
they there &s;eiz'd their great Persecutor
Sir <HI>James Turner</HI> in his Quarters: Afterwards
they march'd to <HI>Kirkubright,</HI> to <HI>Air,</HI> and from
thence to <HI>Lanerck,</HI> where they &s;olemnly renew'd
the COVENANT, and re&s;olv'd to &s;eal it
with their Blood, as we &s;hall immediately find
they were oblig'd to do.</P>
<P>The brief Hi&s;tory of this Rebellion is &s;uch, as
it can be no con&s;iderable Interruption to our
Story, and is much to the Purpo&s;e, to relate
it. The Occa&s;ion being as above; the People
having by Nece&s;&s;ity been driven to repel unju&s;t
Violence by Force, and &s;eeing no Room for
Mercy, but a certain De&s;truction at Hand from
the Troops which were drawing about them,
they re&s;olv'd to &s;tand to it; they were not en|crea&s;ed
to above Four Hundred Men, but tho&s;e
very well arm'd when they marched to the Town
of <HI>Dumfries,</HI> where, as I have &s;aid, they &s;eiz'd
upon Sir <HI>James Turner,</HI> who was the Comman|ding
Officer of the per&s;ecuting Troops which
had oppre&s;t them; him they carry'd away Pri|&s;oner,
tho' as he confe&s;t they u&s;ed him very ci|villy.
From thence gathering and encrea&s;ing in
Number, they march'd to <HI>Kirkubright</HI> and <HI>Air,</HI>
principal Towns and Sea-ports on that Side the
Country, where they &s;eiz'd upon all the Arms
<PB N="163" REF="262">
and Ammunition they could find, but in no o|ther
Thing offered any Injury to any Man. From
hence they advanc'd, being (as was reported)
encrea&s;ed to the Number of above Two Thou|&s;and,
tho' <HI>that</HI> was a great Mi&s;take, to the Town
of <HI>Lancrck,</HI> where on the 26th Day of <HI>November,</HI>
they had a great Meeting, and in a &s;olemn
Manner fa&s;ted and humbled them&s;elves in Be|half
of the Nation of <HI>Scotland</HI> for the great Sin
of National Perjury in making void the COVE|NANT;
and there in the mo&s;t &s;olemn Manner
po&s;&s;ible they renew'd the &s;aid COVENANT
with their Hands and Eyes lifted up to Heaven.
From hence they advanc'd &s;till towards <HI>Edin|burgh,</HI>
where they arriv'd the 27th of <HI>November,</HI>
1666, but being not &s;trong enough to attack the
City, they po&s;ted them&s;elves at the Foot of
<HI>Pentland</HI> Hills on the <HI>South-We&s;t</HI> of the City,
waiting the Conjunction of other Friends who
they expected from the Border and from the
City of <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>
<P>Here they were attack'd and &s;urpris'd the next
Day by General <HI>Dalziel,</HI> even during a proclai|med
Ce&s;&s;ation, with a Body of the King's Forces,
and after a very bold and re&s;olute Defence, they
were at length overpower'd and broken: Many
efcaped, having di&s;per&s;t them&s;elves the Two
Days immediately before the Fight, about Fifty
were kill'd upon the Place, Eighty were taken
Pri&s;oners, and the re&s;t &s;av'd them&s;elves by Flight.</P>
<P>For this Action, be&s;ides tho&s;e &s;lain, Ten were
executed at <HI>Edinburgh, December</HI> the 7th, and
the 11th, <HI>Thomas Pater&s;on</HI> by Name, who was
condemn'd with them dy'd in the <HI>Tolbooth</HI> before
Execution being grievou&s;ly wounded. Five
more were likewi&s;e condemn'd the 10th, and
of four them executed the 14th. Four more
<PB N="164" REF="263">
were executed at <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> the 19th of <HI>December,</HI>
&s;ix more at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> the 22th, eight more at
Air, two at <HI>Dumfries,</HI> and two at <HI>Irvine;</HI> Five
and Fifty who had made their E&s;cape, were
<HI>Fore-Faulted,</HI> as they call it, or Outlawed, and
Proclamation with Reward made for apprehen|ding
them, declaring it Trea&s;on to harbour,
relieve, receive, or &s;o much as to &s;ee and &s;peak
to them. Among the&s;e were &s;everal Mini&s;ters,
of whom more hereafter.</P>
<P>It will hardly be allow'd us in <HI>England</HI> to call
this <HI>Per&s;ecution,</HI> or, that the Sufferers here put
to Death &s;hould be reckoned among the Martyrs
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> becau&s;e (&s;ay they) the&s;e were Men
taken in Arms again&s;t the King, and executed
as Traytors. But we leave all tho&s;e who afterwards
thought it lawful to joyn in the <HI>Revolution,</HI> and
in taking up Arms again&s;t the Oppre&s;&s;ions and
Arbitrary Government of King <HI>JAMES,</HI> to
judge, whether the&s;e good Men had not the
&s;ame individual Rea&s;ons and more for this <HI>Pent|land</HI>
Expedition; and it is An&s;wer enough to all
that &s;hall read the&s;e Sheets, to &s;ay, that the&s;e
Men dyed for that lawful re&s;i&s;ting of Arbitrary
Power, which has been ju&s;tified as legal, and
acknowledg'd to be ju&s;tifiable by the Practi&s;e
and Declaration of the re&s;pective Parliaments of
both Kingdoms: But we leave all tho&s;e Di&s;|putes
to the Readers to determine, as Truth
and Ju&s;tice &s;hall guide them, and return to the
Hi&s;tory of Fact.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the Death of the&s;e poor Men, we find
upon Record above Eight Hundred Men pro|&s;crib'd,
and driven from their Families by the
Violence of the Proceedings of this <HI>High Com|mi&s;&s;ion</HI>-Court,
who, be&s;ides tho&s;e afterwards fal|len
upon, of whom more remains to be &s;aid,
<PB N="165" REF="264">
the&s;e &s;uffered in their Flight all the Mi&s;eries that
Tongue can expre&s;s, even beyond what we read
of in the <HI>11th</HI> of the <HI>Hebrews. They wander'd about
in Sheeps Skins, and Goat Skins, in Dens, and
Caves of the Earth, being de&s;titute, afflicted, tor|mented.</HI>
They &s;uffer'd Extremities that Tongue
cannot de&s;cribe, and which Heart can hardly con|ceive
of, from the di&s;mal Circum&s;tances of Hun|ger,
Nakedne&s;s, and the Severity of the Cli|mate;
where it is known how un&s;ufferable the
Cold is; lying in damp Caves, and in hollow
Clefts of the naked Rocks, without Shelter,
Covering, Fire, or Food: None dur&s;t harbour,
entertain, relieve, or &s;peak to them, upon Pain
of Death: Many, for venturing to receive
them, were forced to fly to them, and &s;everal
put to Death for no other Offence; Fathers
were per&s;ecuted for &s;upplying their Children,
and Children, for nourishing their Parents; Hus|bands,
for harbouring their Wives, and Wives,
for cheri&s;hing their own Husbands; the Tyes
and Obligations of the Laws of Nature were no
Defence, but it was made <HI>Death</HI> to perform na|tural
Duties, and many &s;uffer'd Death for Acts
of Piety and Charity, in Ca&s;es where humane
Nature could not bear the Thoughts of &s;uffer|ing
it. To &s;uch an Extreme was the Rage of
the&s;e Per&s;ecutors carried on.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e Eight Hundred Families, who

<P>But GOD, in his infinite Goodne&s;s, deli|ver'd
<HI>the&s;e</HI> &amp; out of their Hands. Al&s;o it is
very ob&s;ervable, that &s;ome of the above-nam'd
Fifty two <HI>Out-law'd Per&s;ons</HI> being Gentlemen of
good E&s;tates, their &s;aid E&s;tates were &s;eized on,
and given by the King to the mo&s;t violent of
their <HI>Per&s;ecutors,</HI> as an Encouragement to O|thers
to imitate the Inhumanity and Butchery
by which Things had been thus brought to
Extremity.</P>
<P>Nay, &s;ome of them thought, that the <HI>Council</HI>
had it in their real De&s;ign, to drive the poor
People to the <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity of Talking Arms,</HI> in Hole
of getting their Blood and E&s;tates more in their
Power.</P>
<P>Never more let us talk of Popi&s;h Cruelties, or
give the <HI>Romani&s;ts</HI> the Title of BLOODY; let
not the Rigour of the <HI>Inqui&s;ition</HI> any farther en|gage
our Pens, 'till the Barbarities of this <HI>pro|te&s;tant
Inqui&s;ition,</HI> the mercile&s;s, unrelenting Fury
of the&s;e <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Per&s;ecutors has been expiated,
by their being abhorr'd by all Mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="266">
But to leave the Generals, and de&s;cend a little
to Particulars as they occur hi&s;torically to our
View.</P>
<P>It is proper to mention here, becau&s;e we &s;hall
have Occa&s;ion to &s;peak of their Names again,
that, among&s;t the re&s;t of the Ministers who fled
on this unhappy Affair, Mr. <HI>John Welch,</HI> and
Mr. <HI>Gabriel Sample</HI> were two, who&s;e Zeal and
Sincerity in the Cau&s;e of Religion occa&s;ion'd
their being more eminent than their Brethren.
The&s;e fled to the Borders, where they found
Shelter, and Friends to harbour them in an un|expected
Manner; and where they were made
wonderful In&s;truments in God's Hand, to plant
the Go&s;pel and the Fear of God in the Hearts
of the mo&s;t bloody and barbarous of Men, who
were before Robbers, and Murtherers, who, by
the Preaching of the&s;e bani&s;hed Mini&s;ters be|came
Eminent Converts, and both them, and
their Po&s;terity were made Emineut in the
Knowledge of God, and in their Love to his
Ways, in &s;o much, that to the Prai&s;e of &s;o|veraign
Grace, tho&s;e rude and unguided Bor|derers
are now the mo&s;t zealous Profe&s;&s;ors of
the True Religion in <HI>Britain;</HI> and tho&s;e Places
which were Dens of Robbers and Receptacles
of Thieves and Murtherers, are now become
&s;ome of the be&s;t planted, and mo&s;t flouri&s;hing
Congregations of &s;erious Chri&s;tians, perhaps,
in the World.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t not be forgotten here to mention the
Methods taken after this to pro&s;ecute, and fol|low
tho&s;e that fled; <HI>which</HI> (it was &s;aid) <HI>was ow|ing
to the mercile&s;s Di&s;po&s;ition of the Arch-Bi&s;hop
of St. Andrew's (viz.</HI>) publi&s;hing a Proclama|tion,
prohibiting the concealing, or corre&s;pon|ding
with any of tho&s;e who had e&s;caped; and
<PB N="168" REF="267">
this on <HI>Pain of High-Trea&s;on.</HI> In this <HI>Proclamation</HI>
the Fifty &s;even <HI>Gentlemen</HI> and <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> mention'd
before were particularly nam'd.</P>
<P>Thus the Per&s;ecution of God's Servants in one
Country has often been the Means of calling
of Others; and perhaps is yet to be the Means
of &s;preading and planting the EVERLASTING
GOSPEL in all Corners of the World, of which
this Border of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the Colony of <HI>New-England</HI>
has been &s;uch Noble Examples, as we
need look no farther into Hi&s;tory to multiply
Particulars.</P>
<P>But before I quit this Part, one Thing can|not
be omitted, with Relation to the good
Men who dyed thus on Account of this Re|bellion.
The <HI>Per&s;ecutors,</HI> for &s;uch this very
Thing will prove them to be: As if they
were fond of having it &s;aid, That the&s;e Men
dyed for Religion, and not for being in Arms;
and as if they &s;corn'd the Excu&s;e which the
Affair of <HI>Pentland</HI> put into their Mouths for
putting them to Death, cau&s;es &s;everal of them
to be offer'd their Lives, if they would take,
and &s;ub&s;cribe the <HI>DECLARATION to re|nounce
the</HI> COVENANT. Whether they did
this fraudulently or &s;incerely, Providence never
gave them an Opportunity to di&s;cover. Nor,
whether if the Weakne&s;s of any had brought them
to yield, they would have perform'd their
Promi&s;e to them, or no. For, not a Man they
ever offer'd it to (I mean of tho&s;e condemn'd
to dye for the Rebellion of <HI>Pentland</HI>) but re|ceiv'd
it with Indignation, and cho&s;e to dye,
rather than to yield to that <HI>&V;ncon&s;cionable Pro|po&s;al.</HI>
So that in that Point they gain'd an
<HI>&V;ndeniable Te&s;timony</HI> that they $uffer'd for Re|ligion,
<HI>Not accepting Deliverance:</HI> For none or
<PB N="169" REF="268">
them e&s;teem'd <HI>Renouncing the COVENANT</HI>
to be any Thing more, or le&s;s, than <HI>Renouncing</HI>
GOD <HI>and his CH&V;RCH,</HI> to whom, and
for which, that <HI>CONVENANT</HI> was fir&s;t en|ter'd,
and engaged in.</P>
<P>The Cruelty of the&s;e Executions was
attended with one Piece of Inhumanity, which
we believe no <HI>PROTESTANTS</HI> ever practi&s;ed
before; nor was it practi&s;ed in all the <HI>Popi&s;h Per|&s;ecutious</HI>
in <HI>England</HI> in Queen <HI>Mary's</HI> Days:
A Barbarity beyond the Cruelty of Death (viz.)
cau&s;ing the Drums to beat round the Scaffold
all the while the Executions la&s;ted, that the
People might not hear what the Sufferers had
to lay to them, and to di&s;compo&s;e and dis|order
them as much as po&s;&s;ible in their la&s;t
Moments.</P>
<P>It is very remarkable, that the like of this
was never read of in any modern Hi&s;tory, ex|cept
in the Hi&s;tory of that <HI>Bloody Tyrant</HI> and
<HI>Per&s;ecutor</HI> the Duke <HI>d' Alva,</HI> Governour of the
<HI>Netherlands</HI> for the King of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>From this Time we may date the <HI>Per&s;e|cution</HI>
to be in its <HI>Heighth of Fury:</HI> For the
Rage of the <HI>Per&s;ecutors</HI> extended every Way,
Provok'd by the Con&s;tancy of the Sufferers;
till it came to &s;uch a Heighth, as was never
yet heard of in any <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Country in the
World.</P>
<P>The <HI>Poor People</HI> were driven from their Ha|bitations
and from their Families: This was
indeed in their Power, and they did it with
the utmo&s;t Cruelty; but they could never drive
them from their <HI>Principles.</HI> Nor while <HI>Mini|&s;ters</HI>
were to be found, who dur&s;t preach to
them, was it ever po&s;&s;ible to prevent the
<HI>People</HI> a&s;&s;embling to hear them, were the <HI>Pe|nalty</HI>
<PB N="170" REF="269">
Lo&s;s of Goods, Liberty, Impri&s;onment;
nay, even Death it&s;elf. And which was &s;till
wonderful; the more their <HI>Per&s;ecutors</HI> multi|plyed
Laws and <HI>Penalties</HI> again&s;t them, and the
more they were puni&s;hed by tho&s;e Laws for
tho&s;e A&s;&s;emblies, the more numerous they grew,
and Multitudes were added to the Church
every Day by the Sufferings which they met
with.</P>
<P>But the &s;ubtil Enemy finding this, fell upon
a Stratagem which did more Harm to <HI>RE|LIGION</HI>
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as it made a Breach
and Divi&s;ion among the Sufferers, than all the
<HI>Cruelty</HI> of the <HI>Per&s;ecutors</HI> could ever do; and
this was what they called <HI>The IND&V;LGENCE.</HI>
The Hi&s;tory whereof is nece&s;&s;ary to the Ju|&s;tification
of the &s;uffering People, as well a|gain&s;t
the Reproaches of their Friends, who
were not rightly informed of their Circum|&s;tances,
as again&s;t the Slanders of their E|nemies.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>The &s;hort Account of the Affair is thus.</HEAD>
<P>&startq;KING <HI>CHARLES</HI> IId. was a Prince,
not naturally enclin'd to <HI>Cruelty,</HI> not
a <HI>Man of Blood</HI> by his Di&s;po&s;ition; and had, it
&s;eems, &s;ome about him, who had taken the
Freedom to let him know more of the In|humanity
and Barbarity of the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;op</HI>
and his Accomplices, than the&s;e were de&s;irous
he &s;hould have heard of: And particularly,
what was alledg'd by the Friends of the
Kirk again&s;t that <HI>Prelate's Conduct,</HI> when
the King had once before, upon the like
Repre&s;entation, &s;ent an <HI>Expre&s;s Order</HI> to the
<HI>Councils, That no more &s;hould be|out to Death</HI>
<PB N="171" REF="270">
(viz.) <HI>That the Arch-Bi&s;hop kept that ORDER
in his Pocket, 'till he had &s;een the Execution
of the last Nine or Eleven of the</HI> Pentland
<HI>Men who were Condemn'd.&endq;</HI></P>
<P>This being repre&s;ented to the King, his Maje&s;ty
began to re&s;nt it; and &s;poke &s;ome Things,
which gave them Rea&s;on to think that he
would &s;ome Way or other put a Stop to their
Proceeding, if they did not find out &s;ome new
Method to impo&s;e upon him: This they
wickedly, but effectually did, at the &s;ame
Time, and in the &s;ame Act, and Deed, by
which they very fatally divided the Church of
<HI>Scotland</HI> again&s;t it &s;elf in the manner following.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, They told the King, That they (the
Council) were not at all pro&s;ecuting the Whole Kirk;
but only &s;ome few Men that were Enemies to humane So|ciety,
and not &s;afe to be &s;uffer'd in a Civil Go|vernment,
who denyed even the Ordinance of Ma|gi&s;tracy
it &s;elf; and would neither acknowledge,
to &s;ubmit to His Maje&s;ty's Authority or the Laws
of the Kingdom; a few Ob&s;tinate Rebels, who
would neither Obey the Laws of GOD, or &s;ubmit
to the Government of Man. That to convince
His Maje&s;ty of the Truth of this, they had re&s;olv'd
to publi&s;h, an ACT OF INDULGENCE to all
$word$ who would &s;ubmit to the Civil Magi&s;trate, and
give A&s;&s;arances of their Fidelity to His Maje&s;ty's
Per&s;on and Government, allowing them the Exerci&s;e
of Relig$on, according to their Con&s;ciences; and them
His Maje&s;ty, would &s;ee, that tho&s;e People who would
&s;tand out, were not fit to be &s;uffer'd in a human
Society, were Irreconcilcable Enemies to His Ma|je&s;ty
and &s;uch, as no Government could be &s;afe,
till they were rooted out and de&s;troy'd. With
<HI>this Hypocritical Shew of</HI> CLEMENCY <HI>they</HI>
&s;atisfy'd that Ea&s;ie Prince, a Man given up to
<PB N="172" REF="271">
his Luxury and the Effeminacy of his Vices, and
who &s;uffer'd the Mildne&s;s of his Di&s;po&s;ition to be
deluded with fal&s;e Pretences under the &s;hadow of
Lenity, to all that were proper Objects of Com|pa&s;&s;ion;
and leaving tho&s;e who were mi&s;repre|&s;ented
by his Flatterers, to the matchle&s;s Rage of
their irreconcileable Enemies.</P>
<P>To carry on this Farce, they pa&s;s'd an
Act of <HI>Indulgence,</HI> as they call'd it, <HI>Anno</HI> 1669,
after they had wa&s;ted the <HI>We&s;t</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> by their
Soldiers, even wor&s;e than an Enemies Army
would have done in Time of War; and after the
Sufferers were &s;o entirely &s;catter'd, that few were
to be found, and very little Plunder le&s;t to &s;atisfy
the Rapine of their Dragoons: By their Act of
Council, <HI>for they cau&s;ed their Acts of Council to bear
the Authority of Laws,</HI> they proclaimed, &startq;That
all &s;uch Outed Mini&s;ters as &s;hould take Licen&s;e
from the Council,&endq; or the Bi&s;hop of the Dioce&s;s,
<HI>which Licen&s;es al&s;o had &s;everal Limitations annex'd,
all of them directly contrary to the Presbyterian Prin|ciple,</HI>
and Homologating, <HI>as they term it, the Au|thority
of the Civil Magi&s;trate in Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Affairs,
even to the Height of</HI> Era&s;tiani&s;m: &startq;All &s;uch
Mini&s;ters were allowed to preach, and exerci&s;e
the Mini&s;terial Functions in private Hou&s;es or
Meetings, and their People allowed to attend
them with a <HI>Non ob&s;tante,</HI> to all Acts of Parlia|ment
then in Force to the contrary.&endq; So that here
was not only an Inva&s;ion of the Church, but the
Exerci&s;e of the Di&s;pen&s;ing Power in the Extre|mity,
&s;etting a&s;ide the e&s;tabli&s;h 'd Laws made in
Parliament, by the Authority of the Council.</P>
<P>This <HI>Indulgence</HI> kindled a terrible Flame of
Divi&s;ion and Breach of Charity among the &s;uffer|ing
good People, a <HI>Schi&s;m</HI> that is really &s;uch,
carried on even to Excommunicating one another,
<PB N="173" REF="272">
and the Effects of which is felt even to this Day.</P>
<P>Many Mini&s;ters upon Principles to them&s;elves,
perhaps &s;atisfactory, came in, and accepted this
<HI>Indulgence;</HI> being willing to go any Length that
their Con&s;ciences could be &s;atisfy'd with, in Or|der
to pre&s;erve the Priviledge of exerci&s;ing their
Mini&s;try, and preaching the Go&s;pel to their
People.</P>
<P>But the per&s;ecuted People, who&s;e Zeal com|manded
them not to do the lea&s;t Evil to reap
the greate&s;t Good, began to prote&s;t again&s;t this
Compliance of their Brethren, as wicked and de|te&s;table;
declaring not only again&s;t the <HI>Indulgence</HI>
it&s;elf, but again&s;t all tho&s;e who &s;ubmitted to it,
as guilty of yielding to the Power of the Prelate's
<HI>Homologating</HI> the Supremacy, for&s;aking their Prin|ciples,
and breaking the <HI>Covenant.</HI> In a Word,
they not only refu&s;ed to accept &s;uch a <HI>&s;inful Tolera|tion,</HI>
but prote&s;ted again&s;t the making it, as void in
its own Nature, and this in the warm&s;t Manner;
and being thus effectually &s;ecluded from the Ad|vantage
of wor&s;hipping GOD in their Hou&s;es,
even in the mo&s;t &s;ecret Manner po&s;&s;ible, they
<HI>took to the Fields.</HI></P>
<P>Now their Persecutors obtain'd what they de|&s;ired:
For, now they thought they might with
A&s;&s;urance boa&s;t to the King, of having made a
right Judgment in the&s;e Affairs; and having &s;aid
many favourable Things of tho&s;e they call'd the
<HI>Sober Presbyterians,</HI> whom now they cajol'd, in
Order to bring them to accept of the <HI>Indulgence,</HI>
and to take <HI>Licen&s;es;</HI> they repre&s;ented tho&s;e
who remain'd, who were now call'd WHIGGS,
as a Party, who were not to be &s;uffer'd in any
Government, but that ought to be rooted off
from the Face of the Earth; and this is the fir&s;t
Time that the Name of a WHIGG was u&s;ed in
<PB N="174" REF="273">
the World I mean, as applied to a Man, or to
a Party of Men; and the&s;e were the original pri|mitive
WHIGGS, the Name for many Years
being given to no other People. The Word is &s;aid
to be taken from a mixt Drink the poor Men
drank in their Wanderings compos'd of Water
and &s;our Milk; <HI>but that by the Way.</HI></P>
<P>At the &s;ame Period began the <HI>Field-Preachings,</HI>
or <HI>Field-Conventicles,</HI> of which I &s;hall have fre|quent
Occasion to &s;peak more largely.</P>
<P>And at the &s;ame Period al&s;o, the People fre|quenting
the&s;e Meetings, or Field-Preachings,
were fir&s;t call'd <HI>Cemeronians,</HI> from one Mr. <HI>Ca|meron,</HI>
a zealous A&s;&s;ertor of the <HI>Sovereignty of Con|&s;cience
over the Laws of Men,</HI> of whom al&s;o we
&s;hall have Occa&s;ion to &s;peak hereafter.</P>
<P>If the Per&s;ecution was cruel and furious before,
it was now raging and un&s;ufferable, carry'd on
with &s;uch Madne&s;s, and with &s;uch ail un&s;atisfy'd
Thir&s;t of Blood, that I believe, none of the <HI>Hea|then
Per&s;ecutions</HI> in the primitive Times could go
beyond it in all its Parts. It is true, they did
not immediately torment the Body by Fire, by
Racks, and a va&s;t Variety of in&s;trumental Tor|tures;
tho' they had Cruelty enough that Way
too, as in tho&s;e barbarous Engines of Cruelty
call'd the <HI>Boot</HI> and the <HI>Thumbkins,</HI> than which
a more exqui&s;ite Torture could hot ea&s;ily be de|vi&s;ed.</P>
<P>But they had Torments beyond the Cruelty of
Death, which they drove the poor per&s;ecuted
People to &s;uffer (<HI>viz.</HI>) the driving them from
their Habitations into Mountains and Hills, into
Dens, and Holes, and Caves of the Earth, at|tended
with un&s;ufferable, un&s;upportable Hunger
and Cold, in a Climate the mo&s;t unho&s;pitable,
and Places mo&s;t barren, and empty of Su&s;te|nance
<PB N="175" REF="274">
or Relief of any in the&s;e Parts of the
World.</P>
<P>It is not to be calculated how many were &s;tarv'd
in this Manner, and who&s;e Bones, <HI>many of them,</HI>
were found afterwards, who had peri&s;hed in the
mo&s;t deplorable Circum&s;tances, and were not
di&s;cover'd by any other Remains; it would make
the Heart of any con&s;idering Chri&s;tian an bleed, to
contemplate the Mi&s;eries of tho&s;e People who pe|ri&s;hed
in this deplorable Manner, when &s;uch was
the Cruelty of their Per&s;ecutors, that even the
Parents dur&s;t not relieve, or entertain their
Children, or Children harbour, or nouri&s;h their
Parents: But, if the Per&s;on was accu&s;ed of hav|ing
been at one of the&s;e <HI>Field-Meetings,</HI> they
were immediately <HI>pro&s;crib'd,</HI> and <HI>intercommuned,</HI>
by which it was made Death for any one &s;o much
as to &s;peak with them, much more to harbour,
or relieve them.</P>
<P>It has been enquir'd, why the&s;e People would
ib ob&s;tinateiy continue to a&s;&s;emble in the&s;e <HI>Field|-Meetings;</HI>
and I have heard them cen&s;ur'd by
many, who did not urider&s;tand the Circum|&s;tances
which they were reduced to which,
therefore, it is nece&s;&s;ary a little to de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>It is mentioned before, how &s;evere the Laws
they had already made, were again&s;t tho&s;e who
<HI>did not come to Church:</HI> And how none were per|mitted
to exerci&s;e the <HI>Mini&s;terial Office,</HI> but upon
&s;uch and &s;uch Limitations. This they found
embarra&s;s'd them, with the whole Body of the
Kirk, and begun to appear too rigid and &s;e|vere:
And for this Rea&s;on, as before, the <HI>In|dulgence</HI>
was &s;et on Foot. After which <HI>Lenity,</HI>
as it was call'd; they &s;uppos'd nothing would
be call'd <HI>Cruelty</HI> upon tho&s;e, whowould not ac|cept
of <HI>Liberty</HI> upon their Terms; and therefore,
<PB N="176" REF="275">
no &s;ooner was the <HI>Indulgence</HI> granted, but they
began to per&s;ecute with the utmo&s;t Fury all
tho&s;e, who either would not, or did not accept
of their <HI>Benevolent Indulgence.</HI></P>
<P>Immediately Sanguinary Laws were made to
fall upon tho&s;e they had now doom'd to De&s;truc|tion,
for <HI>not complying with</HI> their <HI>mo&s;t merciful
TOLERATION;</HI> and <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> as &s;uch, who thought
fit <HI>to take Licen&s;es from the Bi&s;hops,</HI> were admit|ted,
or indulged to Meet, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in &s;uch and
&s;uch Places. So all other were immediately
&s;entenc'd, by a Law to <HI>&s;uppre&s;s Conventicles;</HI>
whereby all tho&s;e <HI>Mini&s;ters,</HI> who pre&s;um'd to
<HI>Preach, Expound,</HI> or <HI>Pray</HI> in any Hou&s;e where
were more than the Family, were to be impri|&s;on'd
'till they gave Security never to offend
again, or to depart the Kingdom; and every
Per&s;on <HI>pre&s;ented</HI> in &s;uch Hou&s;e to be fin'd a fourth
Part of their Annual Rent, if Gentlemen, and
in Proportion for others: But for <HI>Field-Conven|ticles,</HI>
the Preacher was to be put to Death, and
his Goods Confi&s;cated, and 500 Marks Reward was
given to the Per&s;on that &s;hould apprehend them;
the Hearers al&s;o to be fin'd double to what the
Hearers in Hou&s;e-Conventicles were fin'd.
This is that Famous Per&s;ecuting Law, enticuled,
<HI>Act again&s;t Conventicles,</HI> 6. Act. 2d. Se&s;&s;. 2d. Parl.
Cha. II. Anno 1670. and was continued afterwards
for Three Years more, and after that continued
again, and the Fines doubled.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> who could not accept of this
<HI>Indulgence,</HI> had now their Sentence; if they
thought fit to lay a&s;ide their Office, and neither
be <HI>Mini&s;ter,</HI> or <HI>Hearer,</HI> they were indeed to|lerably
&s;afe; but this they could not yield to.
What was then before them, as <HI>Mini&s;ters,</HI> was
clear; for <HI>Hou&s;e-Meetings,</HI> Impri&s;onment and
<PB N="177" REF="276">
Bani&s;hment; for <HI>Field-Meetings,</HI> immediate
Death. This however did not deterr the poor
People to a&s;&s;emble them&s;elves together, or the
Mini&s;ters to attend and perform the Duty of
their Office, at fir&s;t, in Hou&s;es, but afterwards,
their Numbers encrea&s;ing, they a&s;&s;embled in the
Fields, or Mountains rather; and that in &s;uch
Numbers, and &s;o well prepar'd, as that their
Per&s;ecutors often paid dear for foalling upon them.</P>
<P>But this enrag'd them the more, and oc|ca&s;ion'd
the Per&s;ecution to ri&s;e to &s;uch a Height,
as can &s;carce be equall'd for its Cruelty and Va|riety
in any Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>As I have &s;aid, the Numbers of the People
flocking to the Mini&s;ters were not to be con|cealed,
indeed not to be contained in Hou&s;es;
&s;o that it pre&s;ently become &s;o dangerous to meet
in that Manner, that few, if any &s;uch Meetings
could be held, without being di&s;cover'd, in
which Ca&s;e the Mini&s;ter was &s;ure to &s;uffer Im|pri&s;onment
and Bani&s;hment, and the poor People
were as &s;ure to be ruin'd by Fines.</P>
<P>This cau&s;ed them to quit their Hou&s;es, and go
co the Hills, the Beginning of <HI>Field-Conventicles,</HI>
as I &s;aid before, where they had both Conveni|ance
of Meeting, were much ea&s;ier conceal'd,
and had more Opportunity to make their E|&s;capes,
if di&s;cover'd: Before this had been long
practi&s;ed, the Council took the Alarm; It is
true, as &s;oon as ever the poor People took to
this Method, their Numbers encrea&s;ed to a pro|digious
Degree; for Thou&s;ands of People, who
dur&s;t not di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves in appearing at
Hou&s;e-Meetings, finding more Safety, and al|mo&s;t
an Impo&s;&s;ibility of being di&s;cover'd in the&s;e
<HI>Field-Meetings,</HI> crowded thither; &s;o that it was
very frequent to have 7, 8 to 10000 People at
a Time at tho&s;e Meetings.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="277">
Upon this Method, the Council being, as I
&s;aid, alarm'd, re&s;olv'd to rai&s;e Forces, and to
put the Kingdom to the Expence of keeping,
and &s;upporting a <HI>Standing Army,</HI> on Pretence of
&s;uppre&s;&s;ing the <HI>Cameronians;</HI> a People, who all
that while de&s;ir'd no more than a quiet, peace|able
enjoying the <HI>Liberty of &s;erving GOD, free
from the Impo&s;itions of Men; and who, altho' they
had already &s;uffered all kinds of Oppre&s;&s;ions and In|ju&s;tice,
yet offered Violence to none;</HI> what provok'd
their Enemies on this Occa&s;ion was, that they
could not fall upon them now in the u&s;ual Man|ner
by their Civil Officers and Per&s;ecutors; for
the People having been before di&s;per&s;t from
their Habitations, and not daring to appear
where they were known; yet now gather'd to|gether
from all Parts to the <HI>Solemn Occa&s;ions</HI> of
wor&s;hipping GOD without any Fear, and in a
Po&s;ture not to be ea&s;ily di&s;turbed. This their
Per&s;ecutors pre&s;ently called <HI>REBELLION,</HI> and
repre&s;ented it as well to the <HI>Parliament</HI> there,
as to the <HI>King</HI> Him&s;elf, in the mo&s;t formidable
Appearances, as a Thing threatening a <HI>Civil War;</HI>
and which, if not timely &s;uppre&s;t, would em|broil
the whole Kingdom.</P>
<P>As it was ea&s;y for them to impo&s;e by the&s;e
Things on the mo&s;t credulous Prince in the
World; &s;o they had their Agents ready at Court
to aggravate, and expatiate upon every Article:
And by this Means they brought the Court into
all their mo&s;t Sanguinary Re&s;olutions, and hav|ing,
<HI>as is &s;aid,</HI> obtained an Act of Parliament,
whereby they made it Death, and Confi&s;cation
of Goods, for any Mini&s;ter to Preach, or Pray
at the&s;e <HI>Field-Meetings.</HI> They had this &s;pecious
Pretence to rai&s;e Forces to put that Law in Exe|cution.
The Number of Soldiers they rai&s;ed was not
<PB N="179" REF="278">
great, at fir&s;t, amounting in the whole, not to
above 2500 Men, mo&s;t Dragoons; but they
afterwards thought fit to joyn 3000 <HI>Highland</HI>
Thieves to them, by which they compleated
the Ruin of the Country. With the&s;e Forces
they pur&s;ued the&s;e poor People thro' the Hills
and Mountains, to di&s;turb and &s;eparate their A&s;|&s;emblies;
to which Purpo&s;e, they were order'd
to &s;eize, &s;ecure, and apprehend all they could
lay Hold on, to murther, and de&s;troy all that
made Re&s;i&s;tance; and to plunder, and wa&s;te
the Goods of tho&s;e, who they could not appre|hend:
Nor was any Cruelty omitted by the&s;e
Dragoons, which it was in their Power to inflict,
'till their Mas;ters obtain'd by them the great
End, which they always aim'd at, (<HI>viz.</HI>) to
make the poor People de&s;perate, and drive them
to <HI>take Arms.</HI> This was the Ca&s;e, and this it|&s;ued;
in the <HI>Ri&s;ing</HI> of <HI>Bothwell:</HI> Of which in its
Place.</P>
<P>The&s;e Troops were immediately di&s;pers'd over
the <HI>whole</HI> Country: I mean that Part of the
Country where the Things were chiefly trans|acted,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) the <HI>We&s;tern</HI> and <HI>Southern</HI> Shires.
They were impower'd to apprehend, and bring
dead, or alive, &s;uch <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> as they had given
them by Name: And at length, they had a
Power to apprehend all People, that they had
Rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e were pre&s;ent at any of tho&s;e
Meetings, or were going to them, or coming
from them. This la&s;t Clau&s;e gave them &s;uch an
unlimited exten&s;ive Power, that no Per&s;on was
exempt from their Enquiry, and if they found
any Per&s;on upon the Road, that had but a <HI>BIBLE</HI>
in their Pockets, they took it for a &s;ufficient
Proof, that they either had been at, or were
going to one of tho&s;e <HI>Meetings;</HI> and accordingly
<PB N="180" REF="279">
they &s;ent them to Pri&s;on, where they &s;eldom
fail'd of finding &s;ome Pretence or other, to en|&s;nare
them, and draw them in to &s;ome Acknow|ledgment
of what they call'd a Crime, &s;o to
keep them in Cu&s;tody: For, as the hone&s;t
People would not lye to &s;ave them&s;elves, they
failed not to purge them with Que&s;tions, whe|ther
they had been, or intended to be pre&s;ent
at any <HI>Field - Conventicles:</HI> And many Times
the People &s;o que&s;tion'd would boldly acknow|ledge,
tho' to their own Hurt, That they <HI>both
had been at them, and intended as often as might be
to be pre&s;ent again at them,</HI> defying the Power of
their Enemies, and bidding them <HI>do their
Worst.</HI></P>
<P>By the&s;e Things the <HI>Pri&s;ons</HI> were fill'd with
great Numbers of Faithful Confe&s;&s;ors; and
many were confin'd in the I&s;land of the <HI>Ba&s;s,</HI>
the Ca&s;tles of <HI>Dunnotter, Blackne&s;s,</HI> and other
unwhole&s;ome Places; where they peri&s;h'd with
Di&s;tempers, and in Mi&s;ery, occa&s;ion'd by Want
of Conveniences, by Severity of Cold, and
Length of Time, and Others langui&s;hed without
Hope, or at lea&s;t, without Pro&s;pect of Deliver|rance
17 or 18 Years, 'till their <HI>Per&s;ecutors</HI> were
&s;upplanted by Heaven at the <HI>Glorious Revolution,</HI>
effected by King <HI>William.</HI> Many like wi&s;e were
banished in this Part of the <HI>Per&s;ecution,</HI> and
Hundreds, nay Thou&s;ands were driven from
their Dwellings, <HI>Out-law'd,</HI> and <HI>Intercommuned.</HI></P>
<P>The Reader is de&s;ir'd to ob&s;erve now, that
the <HI>Per&s;ecutions of the Church of</HI> Scotland
may be divided into Two Parts, and they have
their re&s;pective <HI>Periods</HI> of Time. <HI>To wit,</HI> (1.)
<HI>The Per&s;ecution of the Whole PRESBYTERIAN
Church,</HI> as de&s;cribed from the Time of the Act,
<PB N="181" REF="280">
<HI>re&s;toring EPISCOPACY, Anno</HI> 1662: Of
whieh Mention has been made. And (2.) The
<HI>Per&s;ecution of the</HI> Cameronian <HI>Presbyterians,</HI>
(&s;o they were then call'd,) which begun at, or
immediately after the <HI>Declaration</HI> of <HI>Indulgence:
To wit,</HI> in the Year 1670. This <HI>Indulgence</HI>
was called a <HI>Declaration,</HI> becau&s;e it was
not done by <HI>Act of Parliament,</HI> but by the King's
<HI>Council, upon a Letter from the King Him&s;elf:</HI>
And to give it an <HI>equal Sanstion as a Statuted Law,</HI>
an Act was immediately pa&s;s'd in the <HI>Parliament,</HI>
by which it was Enacted, That <HI>the Government
of the Church, and the Ordering thereof does
of Right belong to His Maje&s;ty, and His Succe&s;&s;ors,
by Vertue of His SUPREMACY, and is inherent in
the Crown, and that the King may &s;et forth &s;uch
Con&s;titutions concerning Eccle&s;ia&s;tic Matters, as He
&s;hall find proper, which are to be Obey'd, and Ob&s;erv'd
by all His Subjects as Law.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this <HI>Indulgence,</HI> tho&s;e <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> who &s;ub|mitted
to accept of <HI>Licences</HI> to preach from the
Bi&s;hop, and to take the <HI>Oaths</HI> therein pre&s;cribed;
<HI>To wit,</HI> of <HI>ALLEGIANCE and S&V;PREMACY,
were allow'd to &s;et up Meeting-Hou&s;es for Religious
Wor&s;hip, and to exerci&s;e all the Parts of their Mini|&s;terial
Office to &s;uch Congregations as gathered to them
for that Purpo&s;e.</HI> And it is acknowledge'd, that
in the <HI>East</HI> and <HI>North</HI> Parts of <HI>Scotland,</HI> many,
perhaps, the greater Part of the <HI>Presbyterian
DISSENTERS</HI> did comply, and accept of
this Indulgence, e&s;teeming it better &s;o to
do, than to leave the People <HI>as Sheep without a
Shepherd;</HI> and better than to be utterly depriv'd
of the Means of Preaching the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> at all:
For, tho' they &s;hould have &s;uffred the greate&s;t
Extremities, and had been willing to have en|dured
the wor&s;t their Enemies could inflict, yet
<PB N="182" REF="281">
could they not have had the lea&s;t Opportunity to
have preached, or the People to have heard them
in tho&s;e Parts, where the Country being fully
inhabited, and chiefly by their Enemies, they
would have been certain at all Times to have
been di&s;appointed, and fallen upon.</P>
<P>But, there were a Body of People, e&s;pecially
in the <HI>We&s;t</HI> and <HI>Southern</HI> Parts, who&s;e Zeal car|ried
them beyond all &s;uch <HI>Compliances,</HI> and who
e&s;teeming the accepting of the <HI>IND&V;LGENCE,</HI>
as <HI>Homologating,</HI> (to u&s;e their own Words) their
<HI>&s;olemnly abjur'd Prelacy,</HI> and dete&s;ting every thing
that look'd like <HI>a Yielding up the Cau&s;e of GOD,</HI>
as they really believed theirs to be, &s;tood out,
and would by no Means accept of Deliverance
in a &s;inful Manner.</P>
<P>It is too long a Subject to enter upon in
the&s;e Memoirs, to &s;et down the Rea&s;ons, that
one &s;ide gave for their complying with, and
the other for their rejecting this Indulgence; it is
&s;ufficient to the Ca&s;e in Hand, that the&s;e Men
declar'd they thought the Terms Sinful; that
the Good pretended, was by no means equivalent
to the Evil that was to be committed; that it
was again&s;t the Covenant, by which they were
engag'd to God, to endeavour to their utmo&s;t,
the Extirpation of Prelacy; that they ought to
&s;uffer the greate&s;t Torment, rather than to
commit the lea&s;t Sin, and that as this was in
their Opinion a great Sin, they could not in Con|&s;cience
comply with it.</P>
<P>What they deny'd or refu&s;ed to do, may be
comprehended in the&s;e Heads, with the rea&s;ons
they have for it.</P>
<P>1. They would not accept of an Indulgence
for Wor&s;hiping God, by the Licence of the Bi|&s;hops;
becau&s;e they &s;aid they had abjur'd Prelacy
in the Covenant, and had declared <HI>the Bi&s;hops</HI> to be
<PB N="183" REF="282">
Anti-&s;cripturial and Anti-chri&s;tian, and to take
Licen&s;e from them, was to homologate their Autho|rity
as Legal, which they dete&s;ted and abhorr'd.</P>
<P>2. They would not take the Oath, of Supre|macy,
becau&s;e they could not in Con&s;cience
allow any King or Head of the Church but
<HI>Je&s;us Christ.</HI></P>
<P>3. They would not Pray for the King, or
Swear to him, becau&s;e he was a Per&s;ecutor of
the Church, and thereby an Enemy to God,
becau&s;e he had Renounced the Oath of God in
the Covenant, and till he had repented, they
would have nothing to do with him.</P>
<P>4. Being debarred all manner of Liberty to
Wor&s;hip God in Publick, and on the &s;evere&s;t
Penalties forbid to a&s;&s;emble them&s;elves toge|ther,
either in the Churches, or in private Fa|milies;
and believing it at the &s;ame time their
Duty according to the Scripture, <HI>not to for &s;ake
a&s;&s;embling</HI> &amp;c. They could not &s;atisfy their Con|&s;ciences
to obey Man rather than God.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things however Condemned by others,
who thought the Suffering People &s;trained their
Matters too high; were yet Principles, which
thole People could not in Con&s;cience abate,
or go from; and it was apparent they
would lay down their Lives, rather than abate,
or go from them: And this makes the Pro|ceedings
of the Council again&s;t them be ju&s;tly
e&s;teemed, the height of Per&s;ecution. Nor
were the methods taken with them, &s;uch as could
be ju&s;tifed, either by the Laws of God or Man,
e&s;pecially Chri&s;tians, tho' their Principles had
been really wor&s;e, than their Enemies ever pre|tended
they were: For they were treated not
only with all manner of Cruelty, Barbarity, and
Inhumanity, but with Treachery, Perfidy, and
breach of even the Laws of Nature: They were
<PB N="184" REF="283">
abandon'd to the Mercy of every common Soul|dier,
to kill and de&s;troy them, upon even Su&s;|picion
of Guilt, without Tryal, Evidence, or
Examination; they were made Witne&s;&s;es again&s;t
them&s;elves, and again&s;t one another, and Me|thods
were taken to Try Convict, and Execute
them in a few Moments, without Law, Order,
Judge or Magi&s;trate.</P>
<P>The Mercile&s;s rage of their Per&s;ecutors, was
come to &s;uch a height, that they would frequently
contrive to &s;urprize them, &s;o as that they might
put them to Death, without giving them time
&s;o much as to pray to God, as if they thought
their Rage could extend beyond Death,
and that if po&s;&s;ible, they would puni&s;h
their Souls as well as their Bodies; and I think
it is no Breach of Charity to &s;ay, that if they
could have made an Act of Parliament, that
they &s;hould have had no Mercy &s;hewn them
in the next World, any more than in this, they
would not have fail'd to have pa&s;s'd it: Few
Persecutions in the World, have ever been
Circum&s;tanc'd with &s;uch particular marks of
Inveterate Malice, they have even Envyed them
the Prayers of others, and if upon their Tryals
any one had but &s;aid, <HI>Lord Comfort them,</HI> they
were &s;ure to be taken up and que&s;tion'd for
them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Such Inhumanities have not been Parallel'd in
the World, as has been u&s;ed here, particularly,
that when 250 of them were put on board a
Ship for Tran&s;portation, and the Ship was ca&s;t
away upon the Rocks, &s;o hard hearted, &s;o in|humanly
Cruel was the Officer who Commanded,
that he would not &s;uffer the Hatches to be
opened that they might be &s;av'd, tho' to be
&s;till bani&s;h'd according to Sentence; but &s;tood
<PB N="185" REF="284">
over them till they were all Drown'd in the
Hold of the Ship except 50 who Miraculou&s;ly
e&s;caped, &s;ome of whom are alive at the pub|li&s;hing
of this Account.</P>
<P>The&s;e however are Generals, I &s;hall meet with
them all again in their Cour&s;e: I return to the
Field Meetings, for it is of the&s;e and of the
People frequenting them, that all that is now to
be &s;aid is to be under&s;tood.</P>
<P>After the poor People had thus adjourn'd
their Meetings to the Hills <HI>as is &s;aid,</HI> and the
Council had obtain'd tho&s;e Laws abovemention'd,
declaring it Impri&s;onment, Death, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to be
found at any of them, and Troops were
Levy'd, to put tho&s;e Laws in Execution; there
could be nothing expected on any Side but
Blood, and the Fire of Per&s;ecution was but then
&s;aid to be Kindled.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Civil or pretendedly Legal Step
was an Act of Parliament, 2. <HI>Se&s;&s;. 2. Parl. Cha.</HI> 2.
<HI>Anno</HI> 1670, by which every Per&s;on, of what
Quality, Age or Sex &s;oever, was obliged to An&s;wer
upon Oath, and depo&s;e all that they knew of
&s;uch Field Meetings, and of what Per&s;ons were
thereat? and to an&s;wer to the Que&s;tions that
&s;hould be ask'd them upon Oath, upon Pain
of Impri&s;onment, Fine, Corporal Puni&s;hment,
or Bani&s;hment, at the Plea&s;ure of the Council.
By this Act, Fathers and Mothers were oblig'd
to Betray, and Accu&s;e their own Children;
and Children co Betray and Accule their Pa|rents;
Husbands their Wives, and Wives their
Husbands; and many for refu&s;ing thus to be|tray
their neare&s;t Relations, have been Tran&s;|ported
to the Plantations from their Country,
Relations, and Intere&s;t; where they have been
&s;old for Slaves, and have peri&s;hed by the &s;e|veritg
<PB N="186" REF="285">
of Labour, violent Cold, or violent
Heat, not having been u&s;ed to &s;uch hard&s;hips.</P>
<P>A Serious and Judicious Writer of tho&s;e
Times, &s;ays, &s;uch Havock was made by the
cruelty of the Souldiers, and by the furious Ex|ecutions
of their Arbitrary and Tyrannical
Laws, that greater could not be found in the
Reigns of <HI>Nero</HI> and <HI>Caligula Roman</HI> Emperors,
mo&s;t infamous for Cruelty.</P>
<P>Nor were the&s;e Violences Exerci&s;ed for a
little while, as in &s;everal of the mo&s;t cruel of
the Primitive Per&s;ecutions was the Ca&s;e; but for
Eighteen Years together, the poor People had
no Redre&s;s, no Relaxation, but that every Day,
matters grew wor&s;e and wor&s;e, and more and
more de&s;perate; their Enemies always contri|ving
&s;ome new and unpractis'd Severity, and
acting &s;omething never known before, in Order
more and more to exa&s;perate and oppre&s;s them.
This Account of 18 Years <HI>Per&s;ecution</HI> is to be
Reckon'd from the Time of the <HI>Indulgence,</HI> or,
At lea&s;t, from the Year after (<HI>viz.</HI>) 1670: But,
the whole <HI>Per&s;ecution</HI> continued 28 Years (<HI>viz.</HI>)
from <HI>May,</HI> the Beginning of the Year 1660,
being the fir&s;t of the RESTORATION,
to <HI>November,</HI> the latter End of the Year 1688,
being the Beginning of the REVOLUTION.</P>
<P>Things were now come to the utmo&s;t Ex|tremity,
and the Sufferers being treated thus
with all Manner of Cruelty, had, as is &s;aid, taken
to the <HI>Hills,</HI> where they wor&s;hipped GOD with
more Freedom, and with Gladne&s;s of Heart; but
not with much le&s;s Hazard at the la&s;t; for they
were then fallen upon as Rebels by Troops of
Dragoons who executed the Bloody Orders of the
Council with &s;uch Rage over the poor defence|le&s;s
People, riding over the poor flying Women, and
<PB N="187" REF="286">
Children, and dragging them like Bea&s;ts up and
down the Fields, 'till they brought them to
Pri&s;ons; that it was no Wonder the Men took
Mea&s;ures to meet together with more Safety to
them&s;elves. From this Time it was re&s;olved,
<HI>That &s;eeing Self-Defence was a Natural Law, and
that every Man had a Right &s;o pre&s;erve his own
Life in the Performance of any lawful Action, and
likewi&s;e that the Wor&s;hip of God Was not only lawful,
but their indi&s;pen&s;able Duty, which no human Power
ought to re&s;train, or had a Right to forbid; it was
lawful therefore for them to defend them&s;elves from
Violence, and pre&s;erve their Liberty in the Exerci&s;e,
and during the Time of Wor&s;hip: And therefore they
re&s;olved, That at their &s;aid Field-Meetings, as many
of the young Men that had Fire-Arms, &s;hould come
arm'd, not to u&s;e Violence again&s;t any, but to re&s;i&s;t
the Dragoons, in ca&s;e they &s;hould fall upon the Meeting,
or lay bold of any of the People going to, or coming from
it.</HI></P>
<P>This was the Famous Re&s;olve of the great
Meeting at <HI>LANERCK,</HI> and for a Time, was
&s;ome Surprize to the Per&s;ecutors. For, indeed,
after this they were often beaten back by the
Courage of much inferiour Numbers of the Peo|ple,
notwith&s;tanding their Rage and Fury: And
at other Times the Per&s;ecuted appeared to guard
their Meetings with &s;uch Numbers, and &s;o skil|fully
po&s;ted, that the Dragoons dur&s;t not attack
them: Tho' on all the&s;e Occa&s;ions the Per&s;ecuted
kept them&s;elves on the Defen&s;ive, never offering
anymore, than to &s;tand firm, facing their Enemies,
'till the poor frighted Women and Children were
&s;eprated, and gotten &s;afe from the Place.</P>
<P>I cannot refrain from giving &s;ome few In|&s;tances
of the Behaviour of the&s;e People, when
Power was in their Hands; which may &s;erve to

let Po&s;terity &s;ee whether they were Rebellious
by their Inclination, or, whether they were

own ju&s;t Defence, or not: And to prove, that
even when it was in their Power to have cut
their Enemies in pieces, who well had de&s;erv'd
it for their Cruelty; yet they contented them|&s;elves
with bare Re&s;cuing their Brethren from
the Butchery of the Dragoons, and let the Mur|therers
e&s;cape.</P>
<P>There had been a Meeting in the Fields, in
<HI>Nithi&s;dale,</HI> not far from <HI>Drumlanrig</HI> Ca&s;tle, the
Seat of the late D. of <HI>Queensberry.</HI> The A&s;&s;embly
was very numerous, and there were about &s;ixty
Men with Fire-Arms, who placed them&s;elves at
convenient Distance, &s;o as to keep off their E|nemies,
if they &s;hould come to di&s;turb the A&s;&s;|embly,
'till the People might di&s;per&s;e: The&s;e
al&s;o had Scouts out every Way at great Di&s;tance
to discover, and give Notice, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It was not
long before an Alarm was given, that <HI>They were
betray'd, and that two Parties of Dragoons were
marching to attack them.</HI> Upon this, the poor
People, as was always the Method, &s;eparated,
and went every one their own Way; &s;o that the
Soldiers found them entirely di&s;per&s;t, and no
Meeting in Appearance, except of about 300, who
were gotten together, where their Men were
po&s;ted that had Arms; who pre&s;enting their
Pieces at the Dragoons from the &s;ide of a &s;teep
Hill, where their Hor&s;es were u&s;ele&s;s, they did
not think fit to di&s;mount, and attack them.</P>
<P>The Soldiers however grown furious, and en|rag'd,
&s;pread them&s;elves over the Fields, in
Per&s;uit of the poor &s;traggling People, and &s;eiz'd
&s;everal of them: And among&s;t the re&s;t, they
unhappily fell upon &s;ix Men naked and unarm'd;
<PB N="189" REF="288">
one of whom was the Mini&s;ter: The&s;e, they took
and after having abu&s;ed them, brui&s;ed, and woun|ded
them, tho' they offered no Re&s;i&s;tance, they
bound, and dragg'd them along with them,
making the poor Men go on Foot at their
Hor&s;e-Heels, as fa&s;t as they rode. They car|ry'd
the&s;e Pri&s;oners directly for <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> where
al&s;o they were &s;ure to be put to Death as &s;oon
as they arriv'd.</P>
<P>As the Mini&s;ters, on the&s;e Occa&s;ions, were
very free to hazard their Lives in the Work of
their Office, and for the Comfort and Edification
of their People: So the People again were re|markable
for their Love to their Mini&s;ters, and
their Concern for their Pre&s;ervation: No &s;ooner
therefore was it known among them, that their
Mini&s;ter was taken, but the Men began to gather
together in &s;everal Parties with their Arms. re|&s;olv'd,
whatever it co&s;t, to re&s;cue their Mini|&s;ter;
To this End they di&s;per&s;t them&s;elves into all
the Ways by which they thought the Dragoons
might march, by which it happened, that the
&s;malle&s;t Number of them not being above 37
Men, who lay on the &s;ide of <HI>Entrekein</HI> Hill,
met with them, that being the Way the Enemy
really went with the Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>This <HI>Entrekein</HI> is a very &s;teep, and dangerous
Mountain; nor could &s;uch another Place have been
ea&s;ily found in the whole Country for their Pur|po&s;e;
and, had not the Dragoons been infatu|ated
from Heaven, they would never have en|tred
&s;uch a Pa&s;s, without well di&s;covering the
Hill above them. The Road for above a Mile
goes winding, with a moderate A&s;cent on the
&s;ide of a very high, and very &s;teep Hill, 'till on
the latter part, &s;till a&s;cending and the Height on
the left above them being &s;till va&s;tly great, the
<PB N="190" REF="289">
Depth on their right below them makes a prodi|gious
Precipice, de&s;cending &s;teep and gha&s;tly into
a narrow deep Bottom, only broad enough for
the Current of Water to run that de&s;cends upon
ha&s;ty Rain: From this Bottom the Mountain ri&s;es
i$ &s;tantly again &s;teep as a recipice on the other &s;ide
to a &s;tupenduous Height. The pa&s;&s;age on the
&s;ide of the fir&s;t Hill, by which, as I &s;aid, the
Way creeps gradually up, is narrow; &s;o that
two Hor&s;emen can but ill pa&s;s in Front: And,
if any Di&s;order &s;hould happen to them, &s;o as
that they &s;tep but a litt$e a-wry, they are in
Danger of falling down the &s;aid Precipice on
their right, where there would be no &s;topping
'till they came to the Bottom. And the Writer
of this has &s;een, by the Accident only of a
&s;udden Fro&s;t, which had made the Way &s;lip|pery,
3 or 4 Hor&s;es at a Time of Travellers, or
Carryers lying in that di&s;mal Bottom; which &s;lip|ping
in their Way, have not been able to recover
them&s;elves, but have fallen down the Precipice,
and rolled to the Bottom, perhaps, tumbling
20 Times over, by which it is impo&s;&s;ible but
they mu&s;t be broken to pieces, e'er they come
to &s;top.</P>
<P>In this Way the Dragoons were blindly march|ing
2 and 2 with the Mini&s;ter and 5 Countrymen,
whom they had taken Pri&s;oners, and were hauling
them along to <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> the Front of them being
near the Top of the Hill, and the re&s;t reaching all
along the &s;teep part; when on a &s;udden they heard
a Man's Voice calling to them from the &s;ide of the
Hill on their left a great Height above them.</P>
<P>It was mi&s;ty, as indeed it is &s;eldom other|wi&s;e
on the Height of that Mountain; &s;o
that no Body was &s;een at fir&s;t: But the Com|manding
Officer hearing &s;ome Body call, halted,
<PB N="191" REF="290">
and call'd aloud, <HI>What d'ye want, and who are ye?</HI>
He had no &s;ooner &s;poke, but 12 Men came in
&s;ight upon the &s;ide of the Hill above them, and
the Officer call'd again, <HI>What are ye?</HI> and bad <HI>Stand:</HI>
One of the 12 an&s;wer'd, by giving the Word of
Command to his Men, <HI>Make ready;</HI> and then
calling to the Officer, &s;aid, <HI>Sir, Will ye deliver
our Mini&s;ter?</HI> The Officer an&s;wer'd with an
Oath, <HI>No, Sir, and ye were to be damn'd.</HI> At
which the Leader of the Countrymen fir'd im|mediately,
and aim'd &s;o true at him, tho' the
Di&s;tance was pretty great, that he &s;hot him
thro' the Head, and immediately he fell from
his Hor&s;e; His Hor&s;e fluttering a little with
the Fall of his Rider, fell over the Precipice,
rolling to the Bottom, and was da&s;h'd to pieces.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the 12 Men were &s;tooping to give
Fire upon the Body; when the next Command|ing
Officer call'd to them to <HI>hold their Hands,</HI>
and de&s;ir'd <HI>a Truce.</HI> It was apparent, that the
hole Body was in a dreadful Consternation;
Not a Man of them dur&s;t &s;tir a Foot, or offer
fire a Shot. And had the 12 Men given
Fire upon them, the fir&s;t Volley, in all Proba|bility,
would have driven 20 of them down the
&s;ide of the Mountain into that Dreadful Gulph
at the Bottom.</P>
<P>To add to their Con&s;ternation, their 2 Scouts
who rode before, gave them Notice, <HI>That there
appear'd another Body of Arm'd Countrymen at
the Top of the Hill in their Front;</HI> which how|ever
was nothing but &s;ome Travellers, who,
&s;eeing Troops of Hor&s;e coming up, &s;tood there
to let them pa&s;s, the Way being too narrow
to go by them: It's true, there were about 25
more of the Countrymen in Arms, tho' they had
not appeared, and they had been &s;ufficient, if
<PB N="192" REF="291">
they had thought fit, to have cut this whole
Body of Hor&s;e in pieces.</P>
<P>But, the Officer having ask'd a <HI>Parley,</HI> and
demanded, <HI>What it was they would have?</HI> they
replied again, <HI>Deliver our Mini&s;ter&punc; Well Sir,</HI>
&s;ays the Officer. <HI>Ye's get your Mini&s;ter, and ye
will promi&s;e to forbear firing: Indeed we'll for|bear,</HI>
&s;ays the good Man, <HI>We de&s;ire to hurt
none of ye: But Sir,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>Belike ye have
mare Pri&s;oners: Indeed have we,</HI> &s;ays the Officer,
<HI>and ye mon deliver them all,</HI> &s;ays the hone&s;t Man&punc;
<HI>Well,</HI> &s;ays the Officer, <HI>Ye &s;hall have them then.</HI>
Immediately the Officer calls to Bring forward
<HI>the Mini&s;ter:</HI> But the Way was &s;o narrow and
crooked he could not be brought up by a
Hor&s;eman, without Danger of putting them
into Di&s;order: So that the Officer bad them
<HI>Loo&s;e him, and let him go;</HI> which was done:
&s;o the Mini&s;ter &s;tept up the Hill a &s;tep or
two, and &s;tood &s;till: Then the Officer &s;aid
to him, <HI>Sir, and I let you go, I expect you promi&s;e
to oblige your People to offer no Hindrance to our
March.</HI> The Mini&s;ter promis'd them, <HI>He would
do &s;o. Then go Sir,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>You owe your Life
to this Damn'd Mountain. Rather Sir,</HI> &s;aid
the Mini&s;ter, <HI>to that GOD that made this
Mountain.</HI> When their Mini&s;ter was come
to them, their Leader call'd again to the
Officer, <HI>Sir, We want yet the other Pri&s;oners.</HI> The
Officer gave Orders to the Rear, where they
were, and they were al&s;o deliver'd. Upon
which the Leader began to march away, when
the Officer call'd again, <HI>But hold, Sir,</HI> &s;ays he,
<HI>Ye promi&s;ed to be &s;atisfied, if ye had your Pri&s;oners:
I expect you'll be as good as your Word. Indeed
&s;hall I,</HI> &s;ays the Leader, <HI>I am ju&s;t marching|away;</HI>
it &s;eems he did not rightly under&s;tand
<PB N="193" REF="292">
the Officer. <HI>Well, Sir, bur,</HI> &s;ays the Officer, <HI>I
expect you call off tho&s;e Fellows you have po&s;ted at
the Head of the Way. They belong not to us,</HI> &s;ays
the hone&s;t Man, <HI>they are unarm'd People,waiting
'till you pa&s;s by. Say you &s;o,</HI> &s;aid the Officer,
<HI>Had I known that, you had not gotten your Men &s;o
Cheap, or have come off &s;o free: Says the Country
men,</HI> And ye are for Battle, Sir, We are ready for
you &s;till, if you think you are able for us, ye may
trye your Hands; we'll quit the Truce, if you like.
<HI>NO,</HI> &s;ays the Officer, <HI>I think ye be brave Fellows,
e'en gang your Gate.</HI></P>
<P>The Ca&s;e was very clear, and the Officer &s;aw
it plainly: Had tho&s;e 37 Men, for that was
the mo&s;t of their Number, fir'd but twice upon
them, and then fallen in Sword in Hand, or
with the Club of their Mu&s;quets; not a Man of
them could have e&s;caped; Nay, they mu&s;t
have de&s;troy'd one another; for they would
have thru&s;t one another down the Hill with
but the lea&s;t Offer to move, or turn, or do any
Thing but go forward: Nor could any Dragoon
apply him&s;elf to any Thing but to govern his
Hor&s;e, &s;o as to prevent his falling over the
Edge of the Way down the Hill: Indeed the
per&s;ecuted had them all at Mercy, and had
they commanded them all to lay down their
Arms, and &s;urrender them&s;elves Pri&s;oners at
Discretion, they mu&s;t have done it. But the&s;e
te&s;tify'd by their Moderation, that they &s;ought
no Man's Blood; and that they took Arms meerly
for their own Defence, and yet four of the&s;e were
afterwards Executed for this Fact.</P>
<P>This little Affair made a great Noi&s;e. The
Officer of the Dragoons was threatened with a
Council of War: And whether he was not
broke for Cowardi&s;e I am not certain; but this
<PB N="194" REF="293">
I am certain of that had the be&s;t of them been
upon the Spot, they mu&s;t have done the &s;ame,
or have re&s;olv'd to have made a Journey head|long
andown &s;uch a Hill, as would have chill'd
the Blood of a Man of good Courage but to have
thought of. As to the Mi&s;take, of not di&s;covering
the place before they entred the Pa&s;s. That
Fault lay upon the Officer who was kill'd, who
had already paid dear for his Omi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>There was another Occa&s;ion, in which the
per&s;ecuted People had let the Soldiers know,
that they were not always to expect their Blood
&s;o cheap as they had formerly had it. And
this had been much to their Advantage, had
they not carry'd it on afterwards to an Enter|prize,
which neither their Numbers, or Cir|cum&s;tances
were by any means equal to.</P>
<P><HI>John Graham,</HI> Laird of <HI>Claverhou&s;e,</HI> the &s;ame
who was famous afterwards by the Title of
Vi&s;c. of <HI>Dundee,</HI> and was kill'd at the Battle
of <HI>Gillicranky,</HI> in the Year 1689. was a Furious
Per&s;ecutor, and an implacable Enemy of the&s;e
poor innocent People upon all Occa&s;ions: He
had, among the re&s;t of his Cruelties, barba|rou&s;ly
murther'd &s;everal of the per&s;ecuted People
with his own Hands, as after this Action he did
&s;everal more, particularly one of his own Name,
(<HI>viz.) Graham</HI> of <HI>Galloway,</HI> who fled from him
out of a Hou&s;e where the &s;aid <HI>Claverhou&s;e</HI> had
per&s;u'd and be&s;et him: The young Man
being forced to quit the Hou&s;e, and run to
&s;ave his Life, <HI>Claverhou&s;e</HI> rid after him and o|vertook
him; and tho' the young Man offer'd
to &s;urrender, and begg'd him to &s;ave his Life,
he &s;hot him dead with his Pi&s;tol. This, with
&s;everal other like barbarous Things he practi&s;ed
upon the poor per&s;ecuted People. Of which
hereafter.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="294">
There was a very great Meeting of the per|&s;ecuted
People in the Fields near <HI>Loudoun</HI>-Hill;
where, by Report, many Thou&s;ands were met
together. I think, they had intended to have
the Communion, and to have made it a Day,
both of Humiliation and Rejoycing; a Day of
Humiliation for the Apo&s;tacy of their Brethren,
and for the Sins of the Land: And a Day of
&s;olemn Joy for the Liberty of, and Affection of
the People to the Service and Wor&s;hip of God.</P>
<P>As it was a very great Meeting, &s;o the Num|ber
of Men was greater that were in Arms for
their Defence, than was u&s;ual on other and or|dinary
Occa&s;ions; there being about 200 Men
with Fire-Arms, prepar'd for, and re&s;olv'd to
do their Parts with the Enemy, if they came,
as was threaten'd, to di&s;turb them.</P>
<P>The Laird of <HI>Claverhou&s;e</HI> having Information
of this A&s;&s;embly, prepar'd to attack them; and
had boa&s;ted what Havock he would make of
the <HI>Cameronians</HI> on that Occa&s;ion: <HI>It &s;eems he &s;aid,</HI>
that he heard they had &s;ome Fire-Men among
them, but if they offered to make one &s;hot at his
Men, he would &s;ave the Council and Courts of
Ju&s;tice the Trouble of pro&s;ecuting his Pri&s;oners
with the Formality of the Law, for he would
immediately hang up every one that fell into
his Hands, if he &s;hould take 500. Is was con|fidently
reported, that &s;ome of the Soldiers of
his own Troops give private Notice of this,
and of the mea&s;ures he had taken for a&s;&s;aulting
the Meeting: As al&s;o of the Menaces and
Boa&s;ts he had made. Compa&s;&s;ion indeed might
move &s;ome of the Soldiers; for tho' generally &s;pea|king,
the Soldiers were barbarous and cruel as their
Officers could de&s;ire, yet oftentimes it was found
they were le&s;s &s;o than their Officers.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="295">
However it was, the per&s;ecuted had receiv'd
Information, that <HI>Clarverhou&s;e</HI> with 300 Dragoons
was re&s;olv'd to &s;urround the Meeting, and put
them all to the Sword. This Account came not
to them till after they were a&s;&s;embled, and their
Wor&s;hip was actually begun; whereupon the Men
who had the Guard of the Meeting far from being
&s;urpri&s;ed, con&s;ulted together what they &s;hould do,
whether they &s;hould di&s;per&s;e for that Time, and
appoint another Meeting at another Place and
Time, or what Cour&s;e they &s;hould take.</P>
<P>They had not many Hours to deliberate, much
le&s;s to put in Execution what they &s;hould re&s;olve
on. But, in a Word: It was concluded the People
&s;hould be de&s;ir'd to &s;it &s;till, and compo&s;e them|&s;elves,
whatever &s;hould happen, leaving the
Event to the Providence and good Plea&s;ure of
God; and that they &s;hould &s;end for Help to
all the neighbouring Places, And in the mean
Time to meet <HI>Claverhou&s;e</HI> and his Men, if they
came to attack them; and do as God &s;hould
direct.</P>
<P>Upon mu&s;tering their Men, they found their
Number encrea&s;ed to about 250 Men well arm'd,
be&s;ides &s;everal that came in afterwards: And
before the Action began it's thought they were
near 400. The A&s;&s;embly was great, and the
People &s;ate all on the Ground on the &s;ide of
a &s;teep Hill: The Mini&s;ter preaching to them
from a little Tent near the Bottom of the Hill.
The Laird of <HI>Claverhou&s;e</HI> with his Dragoons came
on with great Fury, like a Troop of Wolves
to fell upon a naked and defencele&s;s Flock of
Sheep, and not expecting any Re&s;i&s;tance, kept
no Scouts out before him; when on a &s;udden they
were challeng'd and bid <HI>Stand,</HI> by an Out-Guard
of the per&s;ecuted; who finding them
<PB N="197" REF="296">
come on, fir'd at them, and retreated to the
main Body. But the Dragoons were a &s;econd
Time &s;urpri&s;ed, when they found a large Body
of Men advantageou&s;ly po&s;ted, the fir&s;t Line of
whom fir'd a Volley of &s;hot upon them, and kill'd
and wounded them 16 or 17 Men, and &s;ome Hor&s;es.</P>
<P>This brought them to halt, and prepare for
Battle: They took not much Time for it,
but came on again with great Fury, but found that
the per&s;ecuted had a large Ditch ca&s;t up in
their Front, with a low old ruined Wall, which
&s;erv'd them as a <HI>Parapet,</HI> from whence they fir'd
with more Security, and &s;o well they plyed them
with their &s;hot, that after 2 or 3 Attempts
they gave it over, and retreated, having lo&s;t
about 30 Men kill'd and wounded; and found
that they had to do with Men re&s;olv'd to die,
and &s;ell their Lives as dear as they could. There
were &s;ome of the per&s;ecuted who &s;ignaliz'd
them&s;elves upon this Occa&s;ion; and who leap|ing
over their Works advanc'd &s;o near them,
as that once a young Gentleman laid Hands
on the Bridle of <HI>Claverhou&s;e</HI>'s Hor&s;e, and had
certainly taken him Pri&s;oner, if he had been
well &s;econded. This was Mr. <HI>Cleeland,</HI> who 18
Years after was Lieut. Col. to the Earl of <HI>Angus</HI>'s
Regiment, which was rais'd among the&s;e very
People at the <HI>Revolution,</HI> and was call'd, <HI>the</HI> Ca|meronian
<HI>Regiment,</HI> being rai&s;ed and compleated
in one Day without Beat of Drum. This was
the &s;ame Regiment, now call'd <HI>Pre&s;ton,</HI>'s which
was at the Attack of the late Rebels at <HI>Pre&s;tons</HI>
in <HI>Lanca&s;hire.</HI> And this Gentleman Lieut. Col.
<HI>Cleeland</HI> was unhappily kill'd at <HI>Dunkeld</HI> again&s;t
the &s;ame <HI>Claverhou&s;e,</HI> then Vi&s;c. <HI>Dundee.</HI></P>
<P>This Action began to make the per&s;ecuted
terrible to the Council: And had they con|tinued
<PB N="198" REF="297">
to have acted thus upon the Defen&s;ive only,
it was thought they would in Time have ruin'd
the Troops of their <HI>Per&s;ecutors.</HI> But their pu&s;h|ing
Things to Extremity afterwards ruin'd them
and all their Friends.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;ie to believe, that this Check enrag'd
the Soldiery to the la&s;t Degree: Many of the
Per&s;ons who had thus appeared being known;
were after this oblig'd to flye, for Fear of falling
into the Hands of their Per&s;ecutors, but the
Heads of the Actors, finding there was no going
back to their own Hou&s;es, they unhappily re|&s;olved
to keep together: <HI>And this begun the Re|bellion
of</HI> Bothwell-Bridge: For, encourag'd by
Succe&s;s, and made de&s;perate by the Extremities
they, were driven to, they in le&s;s than four Days
found them&s;elves near 2000 Men, very well arm'd
and furni&s;h'd; upon this they march'd to <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI>
and were encrea&s;ed in a few Days more to be|tween
6 and 7000 Men.</P>
<P>Their Friends now began to be in pain for
them, becau&s;e <HI>England</HI> was more immediately
concern'd to reduce them now, as well as <HI>Scot|land.</HI>
And the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> was &s;ent down
from thence to command the Army.</P>
<P>This was, I &s;ay, that well known In&s;urrection of
<HI>Bothwell</HI>-Bridge: And it was call'd <HI>Rebellion,</HI> becau&s;e
they Declar'd again&s;t the King: They were after|wards
attack'd by the D. of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> while they
were irre&s;olute, and con&s;ulting whether to yield
or defend them&s;elves, and were defeated.</P>
<P>It is not any part of the pre&s;ent Work to give
the Particulars of this Ri&s;ing. From the Action
mention'd to the Defeat, it is &s;ufficient to ob|&s;erve,
That in this Action there was between
3 and 400 kill'd, and about 1200 taken Pri&s;o|ners:
The re&s;t e&s;caped, and di&s;per&s;t them&s;elves
<PB N="199" REF="298">
as well as they could; nor were the Per&s;ecutors
at all &s;atisfy'd with the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s Con|duct,
who refu&s;ed, at their Reque&s;t, to let the
poor People be per&s;ued and ma&s;&s;acred by the
Dragoons: Not failing to make a Complaint
again&s;t him to the Court of <HI>England</HI> on that
Head, and to have it improv'd to his Di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>Many were the unhappy Con&s;equences of this
In&s;urrection, as well to tho&s;e who were not con|cern'd
in it, as to tho&s;e who were: For tho'
the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> as General of the Army,
re&s;train'd the Rage of the Soldiery as above from
the Inhumanity of a Hot-Blood Execution; yet his
Command cea&s;ing, and him&s;elf returning imme|diately
after to Court, the Per&s;ecutors took
pains to &s;hew the World, that they could act
with more Cruelty in Cold Blood, than Men of
Honour, and of Chri&s;tian Clemency could find
in their Hearts to &s;uffer, even in the Heat of
Victory.</P>
<P>For now they gave them&s;elves a full Swing
in all their Bloody Mea&s;ures, letting loo&s;e the
mo&s;t Bloody Agents of Tyranny to execute what|ever
their private Rage, as well as publick could
dictate to them: Under the Pretence of rooting
out Rebellion, and of executing Ju&s;tice, they per|&s;ued
the Innocent as well as the Guilty; and
put to Death Hundreds of People by all man|ner
of Cruelties; and on the meane&s;t Pretences
imaginable: Nay often without any Pretence
at all, and that in the mo&s;t Barbarous manner.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible here to enter into the Parti|culars
of the Murthers committed upon this oc|ca&s;ion.
And if I &s;hould take all the verbal Re|lations,
that I have met with in conver&s;ing a|mong
tho&s;e, that were Eye-Witne&s;es of the
Cruelties of that Time, it would exceed, if we
<PB N="200" REF="299">
compare the Smallne&s;s of the Country, and
Numbers of the People concern'd&punc; I &s;ay it would
exceed all that ever was &s;et down in any Hi|&s;tory
of Per&s;ecutions, whether of <HI>Popi&s;h,</HI> or
<HI>Heathen</HI> Tyrants.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Year after this In&s;urrection, was
wholly taken up in &s;earching after, and per&s;uing
tho&s;e who were actually in the Army; but had,
by the Mi&s;management, as they call'd it, of the
Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> made their E&s;cape. For,
by the Way, their De&s;ire was, that when the
Body that defended the Bridge were defeated,
and the re&s;t began to di&s;per&s;e and flye,
they &s;hould have been all &s;urrounded, and cut
in pieces, or per&s;u'd, and no Quarter given
them, 'till not a Man of them had been left to
carry News to <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> of the Defeat. And this
having fail'd, they re&s;olv'd, if po&s;&s;ible, to find
out every Man that had been at <HI>Bothwell,</HI> and
put them to Death wherever they found them,
upon the very Spot.</P>
<P>In Order to this, they neither requir'd much
Evidence of the Fact, nor took the pains to
examine the Per&s;ons them&s;elves: But, if it was
but &s;aid to them, that &s;uch a Man, or &s;uch Men
had been at <HI>Bothwell-Brigg,</HI> they immediately
&s;ent the Soldiers to their Hou&s;es, who were to
ask them no Que&s;tions, but &s;eize upon them,
drag them ju&s;t out of the Doors, and &s;hoot them
dead in a Moment. How many poor innocent
Men, after prote&s;ting in the &s;olemne&s;t manner,
<HI>That they had not been any Way concern'd in the</HI>
Bothwell <HI>Affair,</HI> have they &s;hot to Death with
tho&s;e Prote&s;tations in their Mouths! and when
they have fallen on their Knees, and begg'd but
for 2 Minutes Time to recommend their Souls
to GOD, have deny'd them, and &s;hot them
<PB N="201" REF="300">
kneeling as they were, with that Reque&s;t in their
Mouths.</P>
<P>It would make any Chri&s;tian Man's Heart
tremble to read the Bla&s;phemies, the Oaths,
the Cur&s;ings, and the In&s;ultings of tho&s;e People,
over the poor Men and their Families, when
they dragg'd them thus out of the Arms of
their Wives and Children, to Ma&s;&s;acre them.</P>
<P>Add to this, the U&s;age others meet with in
Order to oxtort Confe&s;&s;ions from them of their
being at <HI>Bothwell-Brigg</HI> Rebellion; obliging Men
by Horrible Tortures to accu&s;e them&s;elves, and
weak Women and Children to accu&s;e their
Husbands, Fathers, Brothers, and neare&s;t Re|lations;
putting Fire-matches between their
Fingers, or under their Joints; &s;tripping &s;tark
naked the mo&s;t mode&s;t and tender Women
and Children, and thru&s;ting them out in the
Extremity of Cold; and a Thou&s;and other Vi|olences,
too many to give an Account of, in
Order to di&s;cover tho&s;e who were at this In|&s;urrection
of <HI>Bothwell.</HI></P>
<P>Of the Pri&s;oners taken at <HI>Bothwell,</HI> and exe|cuted
for Rebellion; I &s;hall &s;ay the le&s;s, be|cau&s;e
putting Men to Death who are taken in Arms is nothing but what is u&s;ual in &s;uch ca&s;es:
Not but that as the occa&s;ion of that In&s;urrec|tion
was meerly the Cruelty and Violence of
Per&s;ecution for Con&s;cience. We mu&s;t account
tho&s;e who were executed in cold Blood after|wards,
as all dying by the Hand of Per&s;ecution,
and for the Cau&s;e of Religion; And this was
fully demon&s;trated by Mr. <HI>John King,</HI> and Mr.
<HI>John Kid,</HI> 2 Mini&s;ters taken in the Action at
<HI>Bothwell,</HI> and put to Death at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> on that
Account.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="301">
But when we come to &s;peak of the U&s;age
given to the re&s;t of the Pri&s;oners, who they did
think fit to put to Death by the Hangman:
There we &s;hall &s;ee the Spirit of Per&s;ecution
in the Ab&s;tract; and &s;uch Articles of Cruelty
as are not to be equall'd in <HI>Diocle&s;ian</HI> or <HI>Max|iminian;</HI>
&s;uch as are not to be found in the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI>
Ma&s;&s;acre,or perhaps in any of the mo&s;t Bloody and
Barbarous Per&s;ecutors. No, not in D' <HI>Alva</HI> him|&s;elf;
or even in the <HI>Spani&s;h Inqui&s;ition.</HI></P>
<P>There was as is &s;aid, about 1200 Pri&s;oners,
few more, or le&s;s, taken at <HI>Bothwell.</HI> The&s;e
were in general &s;tript by the Soldiers of what
Cloaths they had upon them, that were any Thing
valuable, and driven like a Herd of Bea&s;ts, bound
two and two to <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> where they were
kept &s;everal Weeks in a Church-yard wall'd in,
being &s;trictly guarded, and allow'd no Lodging but
the Earth; neither any Covering but the Heavens;
either to &s;helter them from Wet, Cold, Sun or
Wind, altho' many of them were very &s;ore
wounded. After this trifling Severity, a pretended
Mercy was extended to them, <HI>viz.</HI> That &s;uch of
them as would &s;ign a Bond condemning their
whole Cau&s;e, acknowledging it to be Rebellion,
declaring it unlawful to Take Arms again&s;t the
King upon any Pretence what&s;oever; and bind|ing
them&s;elves in a Penalty not to do &s;o at any
Time thereafter were let go.</P>
<P>Many took this Declaration, and &s;ign'd this
Bond, being not able to endure the Severity of
that U&s;age which they were expo&s;ed to in the
Church-yard, which however others call'd
Trifling. But many of them refu&s;ed to accept of
Deliverance, upon &s;uch Terms as were again&s;t
their Principles, and as trampled upon the Blood
of their Brethren who had dy'd in that Quarrel&punc;
<PB N="203" REF="302">
The&s;e were near 400; and the <HI>Council</HI> not thinking
it proper to &s;et the Hangman to Work upon them
all; above 50 having already been put to Death,
found out new and unheard of Ways of Mur|thering
the greate&s;t Part of them altogether;
About 300 of them having receiv'd a general
Sentence of Tran&s;portation to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colonies
in <HI>America;</HI> a Ship was found which as was pre|tended
was bound to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> or rather was hir'd
by the Government to Tran&s;port the&s;e poor Vic|tims
to <HI>Jamaica;</HI> where they were to be &s;old as
Slaves. On board this Ve&s;&s;el the&s;e People were
&s;hip'd. Some have ventur'd to tell us, That &s;o
great a Number could not po&s;&s;ibly have gone to
<HI>Jamaica</HI> in that Ship; That the Ve&s;&s;el was by no
Means able to have carry'd fre&s;h Water and ne|ce&s;&s;ary
Provi&s;ions for &s;o great a Number, and &s;o
long a Voyage. And moreover, upon Exa|mination
we have been told that it did appear,
That no proportion of Provi&s;ions for &s;uch a
Number and &s;uch a Voyage was in the Ship at
that Time: All which, if true, &s;erve to prove,
That what was afterwards wickedly done was the
Horrid Contrivance and Bloody In&s;tructions of
the Per&s;ecutors, who had re&s;olv'd the De&s;tru|ction
of the poor Sufferers whatever it co&s;t.</P>
<P>The Ship &s;ail'd, as above, and whether by
Stre&s;s of Weather, Negligence or Wickedne&s;s,
it is not material; neither could the poor Pri|&s;oners
who were lock'd under Hatches judge of
it. But this is certain, that coming near the
Northermo&s;t part of <HI>Scotland</HI> near the <HI>Orkneys,</HI>
the Ship was driven on &s;hoar among&s;t the
Rocks, and &s;tuck fa&s;t. The Ship's Crew &s;av'd
them&s;elves, and all that belong'd to them; and
all the Pri&s;oners, had they been allow'd to &s;hift
for them&s;elves, would have been &s;av'd with Ea&s;e
<PB N="204" REF="303">
enough; but the Officer &s;et over them would
not &s;uffer the Hatches to be opened, neither could
any Entreaty prevail upon him to let one Soul of
them out, 'till the Ship being da&s;hed to Pieces,
they were all of them drowned in the Hold, ex|cept
only, that an Hone&s;t Seaman, &s;eeing, and be|ing
&s;truck with Horror at so Barbarous an Act;
ventur'd his Life to go on Board, and with an
Axe cutting thro' the Deck of the Ve&s;&s;el got
Forty nine of them out alive; the re&s;t being
about Two Hundred and fifty peri&s;hed to|gether.
After this Piece of Cruelty is related,
I think I need make no Apology for having &s;aid,
That the Reign of <HI>Diocle&s;ian,</HI> or any of the mo&s;t
Cruel Per&s;ecutors of God's Church could not
match it: For the&s;e were Men delivered, Men to
whom Life was granted; after the Decimations
and Drafts made out of them for the Gibbet and
Scaffold were over, the&s;e were &s;entenc'd to Tran&s;|portation;
but given up to be Murther'd in the
mo&s;t Inhumane and mo&s;t Unprecedented Man|ner,
&s;uch as I believe no Hi&s;tory can &s;hew the
like of.</P>
<P>Another Ship which had 60 or more of the&s;e
Bani&s;h'd Men put on board her, whereof &s;everal
were Mini&s;ters, and being oblig'd by the Act of
Navigation, really for &s;he was bound for <HI>Jamaica</HI>
to go fir&s;t <HI>England</HI> there by the Good Provi|dence
of God, &s;ome Mi&s;under&s;tanding happening
between the Owners and Freighters of the Ve&s;&s;el,
upon the Terms of Charter-Party, the Ship was
not permitted to go the Voyage; and the poor
Sufferers got their Liberty, no Thanks to their
Per&s;ecutors.</P>
<P>There was near an Hundred others Tran&s;por|ted
in &s;everal Ships; &s;ome to one Country, &s;ome
to another; be&s;ides about 30 of the &s;ame <HI>Both-well-Brigg</HI>
<PB N="205" REF="304">
Pri&s;oners, that dy'd in Pri&s;on either
of their Wounds, or otherwi&s;e by Di&s;tempers
contracted in their Confinement, and by the
Cruelty of their Keepers.</P>
<P>But this was not an End of the <HI>Bothwell-</HI> Bridge
Affair: For, as I &s;aid before, it was made for
&s;ome Years the Subject of the Stricte&s;t Inqui&s;ition;
and Abundance of poor People were Murther'd in
Cold Blood by the Per&s;ecutors on Pretence of
their having been at that Rebellion; as &s;hall ap|pear
in its Place.</P>
<P>In the Time of the&s;e Tran&s;actions the Arch-Bi&s;hop
of St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s, the mo&s;t Fierce and Cruel
Per&s;ecutor of the Good People afore&s;aid; and
One, who, as was reported, had declared it as
his Opinion, That they were not a People fit to
live; but ought to be extirpated from the Face
of the Earth, was him&s;elf cut off by the Hands
of &s;ome Men, who&s;e Zeal carrying them beyond
their Patience, took upon them this Execution,
as a Thing they had a Right to, as they &s;uppo|&s;ed;
there being no Way to obtain Publick
Ju&s;tice any other Way.</P>
<P>There have been &s;everal Accounts given in
Publick of this Man's Death; the Truth and Im|partiality
of which I have much Rea&s;on to que|que&s;tion,
not only becau&s;e I have heard it other
ways related; but becau&s;e tho&s;e Accounts have
manife&s;t Contradictions in them, both as to the
Manner and Circum&s;tances of the Fact, and as
to the Per&s;ons concern'd in it; neither &s;hall I
&s;ay any more than this for the Relation here &s;et
down, than that it came immediately from the
Mouth of one of the Per&s;ons concern'd in it;
and &s;hall be repeated as near as po&s;&s;ible in the
very Words.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="305">
&startq;We were (&s;ays' this Per&s;on) a poor People
made de&s;perate by the Violence of our Per&s;e|cutors;
and &s;till more &s;o for Want of Oppor|tunity
and Strength to re&s;i&s;t them by Force;
which in Ca&s;e of &s;uch manife&s;t Inju&s;tice as we
daily receiv'd, we had very much Will to do,
and believ'd was not only lawful, but our
Duty: And on this Principle we acted before
at <HI>Pentland,</HI> and afterwards at <HI>Bothwell;</HI> which
we believe were very Lawful and Ju&s;tifiable
Actions; however, it plea&s;ed not the Lord to
give us Succe&s;s therein. In the Per&s;uit of this
Opinion, it was propo&s;ed at a Meeting, whe|ther
we being therefore, tho' &s;uppre&s;t by Power
in a State of War, with our Per&s;ecutors, who had
illegally vow'd our Extirpation; it were not law|ful
for us to de&s;troy them by Surprize, or by at|tacking
them as well a-part, as together, where|ever
we could find them; and it was unani|mou&s;ly
agreed, That it was Lawful. Next it
was propo&s;ed, That whereas all Appeal to the
Publick Ju&s;tice being deny'd us; and all Re|medy
again&s;t our Oppre&s;&s;ions, That is to &s;ay,
&s;uch as the Civil Magi&s;trate ought to yield us,
being render'd impo&s;&s;ible, we might, and ought
endeavour to execute that Ju&s;tce which God
Him&s;elf had Denounced again&s;t Murtherers; and
which God had by His Own Law deputed to
the next of <HI>Kin.</HI> That the Per&s;ons here put
to Death were Murther'd, nay even Butcher'd
many of them without &s;o much as any Pretence
to the Legal Forms, and ordinary Cour&s;e
of Ju&s;tice, being Kill'd in Cold Blood by
the Raging Soldiers, or by Bloody minded
Per&s;ecutors, back'd and &s;upported by the &s;aid
Soldiers; and this by meer Surprize, and Ra|venous
Unguided Rage, being equal to A&s;&s;|&s;ination,
<PB N="207" REF="306">
or rather &s;omething like being de|vour'd
by Wild Bea&s;ts or Savages.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That upon &s;uch as Murther'd without Law,
Ju&s;tice was to be Executed without Law, and
the Sword of God was in every Injur'd Man's
Hand to Execute the Divine Ju&s;tice on &s;uch;
no Ju&s;tice being al&s;o to be had from Men, tho&s;e
who bore the Sword, not bearing it in vain only
but joyning them&s;elves to, protecting, and
aiding the&s;e Murtherers, and therefore bearing
equal Guilt <HI>art and part</HI> with them.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This likewi&s;e was re&s;olv'd upon in the Af|firmative;
whereupon we who were then pre|&s;ent,
and who&s;e Souls were fir'd with Zeal for
God's Glory, re&s;olv'd with <HI>Phineas</HI> to Execute
Ju&s;tice on tho&s;e who had thus lifted up their
Hand again&s;t the Lord's People, wherever they
might be found; and to place our &s;elves in
the Room and Authority of the Avenger of
Blood for our Innocent Brethren, who were de|&s;troy'd
and cruelly Ma&s;&s;acred for the Cau&s;e of
God and the Te&s;timony of a Good Con&s;cience.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;In this our Zeal, and fortify'd with &s;uch
Con&s;iderations as the&s;e, 5 Men of our Number
Arming our &s;elves, plac'd our &s;elves in Am|bu&s;h,
with De&s;ign to Execute God's Ju&s;tice
upon the Laird of, a Cruel and
Bloody Per&s;ecutor of God's People; and who
had, not many Days before, put to Death, &s;e|veral
of our Brethren in the Province of <HI>Fife&punc;</HI>
This was our lntent, neither had we at that Time,
any Thought or Expectation of any other, when
we were &s;urpriz'd with an Account from one
of our Number who was at a Di&s;tance; that
the Arch-Enemy of God and his People, the
Prelate of St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s, was pa&s;&s;ing on the
Road in his Coach.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="307">
&startq;It was immediately &s;ugge&s;ted to us, that al|beit
we had mi&s;&s;ed of the Man who we had
&s;ought for; yet God had by a Wonderful
Providence delivered the Great and Capital
Enemy of his Church into our Hands; and
that it was a Vi&s;ible Call to us from Heaven
not to let him e&s;cape: That he had been a
Notorious Per&s;ecutor of God's People, and a
Vile Murtherer of our Brethren; particularly
in that, when the King Him&s;elf &s;ent his Com|mands
to the Council in the Year 1666 after
<HI>Pentland</HI> Ri&s;ing, That no more &s;hould be put
to Death; which Command was &s;ent in Wri|ting
directed to the &s;aid Privy Council, and
was deliver'd to the &s;aid Bi&s;hop: yet that he
had kept the &s;aid Written Order in his Pocket
`till the la&s;t 10 Per&s;ons mentioned in this Work
<HI>p.</HI> 166, who were then in Pri&s;on, were put to
Death; and that now was the Time when that
Scripture was to be executed by them, <HI>He who
&s;pilleth Man's Blood by Man &s;hall his Blood be
&s;pilt;</HI> And that they ought not only to believe
that God had deliver'd him up into their Hands;
but that if they let him, e&s;cape it &s;hould be re|quired
of them and of their Brethren, as in the
Ca&s;e of King <HI>Ahab, 1 Kings 20, 42. Becau&s;e
thou ha&s;t let go out of thy Hand a Man who I ap|pointed
to utter De&s;truction; therefore, thy Life
&s;hall go for his Life, and thy People for his
People.&endq;</HI></P>
<P>&startq;Fortify'd with the&s;e Principles, and parti|cularly
with this Thought, <HI>viz.</HI> how won|derfully
God had deliver'd this Great Enemy
into our Hand; we re&s;olv'd that he &s;hould
nor e&s;cape. However, one of our Number
declined acting therein, having a private Rea|&s;on
again&s;t his bearing part in this Work; but
<PB N="209" REF="308">
not prevailing with us to de&s;i&s;t from our Re&s;o|lution,
which we thought we had a Call from
Heaven to fini&s;h, he withdrew from us, &s;tand|ing
at a great Di&s;tance, &s;o as to have no Hand
in the Action; in which Ca&s;e the Hand of God
was farther remarkably &s;een by the Con&s;e|quence:
For, that none of us ever fell into
the Hands of the Enemy, or were put to Death
for this Fact, but that one Per&s;on, <HI>viz.</HI> Hack|&s;ton
of <HI>Rathillet</HI> who really had no Share in the
Work, but refu&s;ed to joyn with us therein
as before.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Having re&s;olv'd, <HI>as is &s;aid,</HI> That this Ene|my
&s;hould not e&s;cape the Judgment of God by
our Hands; we rode after him, and coming up
to the Coach, quickly &s;topped the &s;ame, and
di&s;arming his Servants, we gave him Notice of
our Re&s;olutions, letting him know his Offen|ces;
and in &s;erious Terms exhorting him to
give Glory to God, by Cofe&s;&s;ing his Guilt,
and that he would repent heartily for the
Wickedne&s;s of his Ways, and the Innocent
Blood that he had &s;hed; for that, now his
Time was come to dye for the &s;ame.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It was &s;ome Time e'er we could convince
him, That we were in Earne&s;t re&s;olv'd to put
him to Death; and he &s;eemed to &s;mile at what
we had &s;aid about the Wickedne&s;s of his Life:
His Daughter al&s;o who was with him in the
Coach, railed on us with much Evil Language.
But thereafter, cau&s;ing her to come forth of
the Coach, we let him know, that his Mo|ments
were very few; that we would wait for
him yet a tittle while, and exhorted him
not to trifle with his Soul, but to call upon
God for Mercy: After which, &s;eeing us in|deed
in Earne&s;t, he began to entreat for Life:
<PB N="210" REF="309">
But we &s;oon let him know, we were not to be
put by our Purpo&s;e for any Entreaties that
could be u&s;ed, and that there was no Mercy
to be &s;hown to him, who had &s;hown no Mer|cy.
Hereupon he began to think of Death.
But <HI>here ju&s;t the very Words of the Per&s;on who
related the Story,</HI> Behold! <HI>God did not give
him the Grace to pray to him without the Help of
a Book.</HI> But he pull'd out of his Pocket a
&s;mall Book, and began to read over &s;ome
Words to him&s;elf, which filled us with A|mazement
and Indignation. However, wait|ing
&s;ome Time, and then calling again upon
him to commend his Soul to God's Mercy,
for that he &s;hould immediately dye; we fir'd
upon him with our Pi&s;tols: When finding he
was not yet dead, and remembring that it had
been reported, that he had u&s;ed Sorcery, in
Order to defend his Body, and that he was
invulnerable; and withal to rid him of Life
with as little Torture as we might, we &s;lew
him with our Swords, and departed.&endq;</P>

Body guilty, and then to make Men their own
Accu&s;ers, charging them&s;elves with belonging
to the Body or Society, by owning the Prin|ciples
upon which they acted.</P>
<P>This is that unheard of Part, which con&s;ti|tutes
this Per&s;ecution to be the mo&s;t Inhuman
of all the Per&s;ecutions which we read of, ei|ther
before or &s;ince the Primitive Age of the
Church of God; and by which the Sufferings
of the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> are di&s;tingui&s;h'd from
the Sufferings of all that ever went before
them.</P>
<P>And what Reproach mu&s;t the Practice of the&s;e
Times leave upon the Epi&s;copal Party now alive
in <HI>Scotland;</HI> many of whom were real Actors in
the Cruelle&s;t Part of this Tragedy! Nay, &s;aving
that the Author of this would not by naming of
Names, load the Heads of &s;ome who are at the
Writing of this, under the ju&s;t Pro&s;ecution of
the Government for Trea&s;on and Real Rebellion.
He could &s;ingle out the Per&s;ons of &s;ome that are
now in the Hands of Ju&s;tice; who were among
the mo&s;t Bloody and Raging Per&s;ecutors of tho&s;e
Times: But omitting their Names, however
ju&s;t the Reflection, he cannot but lead them by
the Hand to this ju&s;t Ob&s;ervation, <HI>viz.</HI> How
Righteous is that Providence, which cau&s;es them
to lye at the Feet of a Provok'd Sovereign,
Crying for Mercy, <HI>AND TO BE DENYED;</HI>
who Denyed Mercy to &s;o many of their Inno|cent
<PB N="212" REF="311">
Neighbours and Fellow-Creatures; who
were Guilty neither of Trea&s;on or Rebellion;
but only of Wor&s;hipping the Great Creator of
all Things according to His Command; and in
&s;uch a Manner as the Authority of Con&s;cience
made their indi&s;pen&s;ible Duty.</P>
<P>But to return to the Facts: Pro&s;ecutions in
Forms of Ju&s;tice, <HI>as I &s;aid,</HI> &s;eem'd now at an
End; the Methods of drawing Blood &s;eem'd to
be exhau&s;ted, tho' the Thir&s;t of Blood was not
quench'd. The Number of Pri&s;oners to be
dragg'd to Execution, or Informers to accu&s;e
particular Per&s;ons either were few, or too few,
to &s;ati&s;fie the voracious Appetite of the Per&s;e|cuting
Party: Nor was it particular Per&s;ons, but
the whole Body of Chri&s;tians in the Denomina|tion
of <HI>Whiggs,</HI> who&s;e Blood they re&s;olv'd to
&s;hed.</P>
<P>Being therefore un&s;atisfy'd with the per&s;onal
Guilt of &s;uch who had been at <HI>Bothwell-Bridge;</HI>
or &s;uch as could be found at Field-Meetings.
who&s;e Number, <HI>tho' daily great,</HI> were but few,
when compar'd with what they re&s;olv'd to fall
upon. They proceeded now to &s;um up their
Profe&s;&s;ion into Generals; to form them into
Principles; and then make tho&s;e Principles
Criminal: By which Method they knew, they
&s;hould infallibly involve the whole Body of tho&s;e
People in &s;uch Circum&s;tances, as would entitle
the Government to a Right to put them to
Death. The Ca&s;e was thus.</P>
<Q><P>1. They knew, That the&s;e per&s;ecuted People
e&s;teem'd them&s;elves engaged by the <HI>Na|tional
Covenant</HI> in the Solemne&s;t Bond ima|ginable:
That it was the Oath of God;
that no human Power could di&s;&s;olve the
<PB N="213" REF="312">
Obligation: And that the breaking it as
it had been broken, was no le&s;s a Crime
than a National Perjury.</P>
<P>2. They look'd upon the King as an Enemy and
Per&s;ecutor of God's People; as a Prince per|jur'd,
by his Breaking and Renouncing the
Covenant; and guilty of involving the whole
Nation in the &s;ame Dete&s;table Crime of
Perjury: Al&s;o they look'd upon him as
a Per&s;ecutor of God's Church, and a
Bloody De&s;troyer of his People. And for
the&s;e Rea&s;ons they could not &s;atisfy them|&s;elves
to pray for him, or &s;ay to him, God
&s;peed.</P>
<P>3. As for the Killing the Arch-Bi&s;hop of St.
<HI>Andrew</HI>'s, they did not e&s;teem it a Mur|ther,
or an A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination; but e&s;teeming
them&s;elves to be in Open War with him,
and with all the Members of that Bloody
Society call'd, <HI>The Council of Scotland;</HI> who
had treated them and their Brethren with
Barbarity as Enemies to Mankind; and had
by all Kinds of Cruelty and Inhumanity
<HI>without Law; except &s;uch as their Lu&s;t of
Blood form'd into Acts of Council, and contrary
to the Con&s;titution had call'd Laws; and to
which they gave the Force of Laws;</HI> put their
Brethren unju&s;tly to Death; which they
e&s;teem'd Murther of the vile&s;t Sort, e|&s;teeming
the&s;e Men, I &s;ay, by their Bloody
Doings to be Blood-Suckers, Murtherers,
and open declared Enemies to God and
Man: They thought it ju&s;t, <HI>as in Time
of War,</HI> to per&s;ue them to Death in what
Manner they could, and wherever they
<PB N="214" REF="313">
could, and wherever they might be
found.</P>
<P>4. As to the Taking Arms at <HI>Pentland</HI> and at
<HI>Bothwell,</HI> and other Places; they would by
no Means admit it to be Rebellion: Be|cau&s;e
Nature dictating Self-Defence to all
Creatures to whom it has given a Life to
defend. And they being attack'd by the
Arm'd Troops of their Per&s;ecutors, while
they innocently and peaceably performed
their undoubted and indi&s;pen&s;ible Duty,
<HI>viz.</HI> the Wor&s;hipping God according to his
own In&s;titution; they thought them&s;elves
bound by the Laws of Nature, and al|lowed
by the Laws of God to defend their
Lives, and the Lives of their Wives and
<HI>Children.</HI></P></Q>
<P>As the poor People maintain'd the&s;e Prin|ciples
with the greate&s;t Exactne&s;s; and per|&s;i&s;ted
to do &s;o with the greate&s;t Con&s;tancy:
So their Per&s;ecutors knew well what U&s;e to
make of this Steady Adherence to their Prin|ciples;
and how to make it a Handle to them
to take Hold of the otherwi&s;e mo&s;t innocent
and inoffensive part of the People, and drag
them to immediate Execution without further
Proce&s;s. And this Device they que&s;tion'd not
would &s;erve them to de&s;troy and extirpate the
whole Body of the People, as they owned was
their De&s;ign.</P>
<P>To this Wicked and Barbarous Purpo&s;e they
fram'd 4 Que&s;tions upon the Heads above-men|tioned;
which they re&s;olv'd to have offer'd to
the per&s;ecuted People upon all Occa&s;ions; and
to which they &s;hould oblige the &s;aid People to
<PB N="215" REF="314">
give an immediate direct An&s;wer: On refu&s;ing
which An&s;wer, or not an&s;wering to their Minds,
they were immediately to be put to Death.
And here is to be noted, that <HI>as it was &s;aid,</HI> the
late Arch-Bis;hop of St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s, Gen. <HI>Dalziel,</HI>
and &s;everal others of the fierce&s;t of the per&s;e|cuting
Council had often complain'd, That the
Formalities of the Law, that is to &s;ay, bringing
Men to the Bar, and to be Try'd by Judges,
Juries, Hearings, Pleadings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were Ob&s;truc|tions
to the King's Service: So the pre&s;ent
Council proceeding by the &s;ame Rules of Cruelty,
re&s;olv'd to make &s;horter Work with them; and
therefore, that the Forms of Proce&s;s, bringing
to Pri&s;ons, and to Tryals, might not delay, or
encumber the Execution, and prevent the dis|patching
the innocent Victim fa&s;t enough. They
decreed, That every private Soldier, <HI>an Army
of whom they had now Quarter'd upon the per&s;ecuted
People,</HI> &s;hould have Power to tender the &s;aid
Que&s;tions to every Man they met, or to whom
they plea&s;ed; and upon refu&s;ing to an&s;wer, the
&s;aid Soldier was empowered, to kill them upon
the Spot; and le&s;t I may be thought to do this
General <HI>Dalziel</HI> an Injury, and record of him
any Thing which was not &s;uitable to the re&s;t of
his Practice; who, if Fame belies him not, was
a Man as void of Humanity, as mo&s;t that ever
Heaven permitted to live. I &s;ay, that I may
not wrong him, I &s;hall give the following brief
Account of an Action of his, or a Specimen of
his compa&s;&s;ionate Temper; by which the Cha|racter
of the Man may be gue&s;t at without
Breach of Charity. It was &s;oon after the Ri&s;ing
at <HI>Pentland,</HI> when he had been &s;ent into the
Shire of <HI>Air,</HI> to make Search for, and put to
Death &s;uch of the poor People as he could find
<PB N="216" REF="315">
were in the &s;aid Ri&s;ing. He &s;ends a Lieutenant
with a Party of Men to <HI>New-Mills,</HI> and order'd
them to &s;eize and bring to him an hone&s;t poor
Man, who&s;e Name was <HI>Finlay,</HI> and who was
peaceably living in his own Hou&s;e, nor had he
been at all in Arms: When his Men brought
the Pri&s;oner to him he examin'd him private|ly,
<HI>no Witne&s;s being by;</HI> and with a kind or Ci|vility,
unu&s;ual to him, whether he had been at
<HI>Lanerck</HI> with the Rebels? The Man an&s;wer'd,
He was at <HI>Lanerck</HI> upon his private Bu&s;ine&s;s
when their Army came thither; and told him
what his Bu&s;ine&s;s was, offering to prove the
Truth of it; and declared, That he was not in
Arms, or had any Weapon with him: Nei|ther
did he go among them: Then he ask'd
him if he remembred any of tho&s;e he &s;aw a|mong
them, and who they were? The Man
declar'd he did not; whereupon he calls for
the Lieutenant, and order'd him to carry that
Man to the Gallows, and have him &s;hot to
Death: For that he had confe&s;t he was with
the Rebels. The poor Man being brought to
the Place in a great Hurry and Surprize asks
the Lieutenant, if the General was in Earne&s;t;
the Lieutenant &s;aid he feared he was: How|ever
being a Civil Man, and loth to Execute
&s;uch a Cruel Commi&s;&s;ion, and the poor Man
prote&s;ting his Innocency, and entreating him as
a Chri&s;tian, that at lea&s;t he might have a Re|prieve
for that Night, that he might prepare
for Death and Eternity. The Lieutenant, I &s;ay,
upon this goes back to the General, and laying
before him the poor Man's Ca&s;e, entreated him
to grant him a few Hours Time no prepare for
Death: But the General flying out in a Rage
at the Lieutenant, and with Horrid Oaths and
<PB N="217" REF="316">
Bla&s;phemies commands him to return, and tells
him he would teach him to obey his Orders after
a better Manner, than to come back and make
him&s;elf an Advocate for Rebels: Upon this,
the Lieutenant went back directly to the Man,
and immediately &s;hot him dead upon the Spot.</P>
<P>This and &s;uch as this was their Temper at
that Time; And I think I may &s;ay they were
now come to the Height of their Fury. The
Mea&s;ure of their Cruelty fill'd up a-pace; all the
<HI>French</HI> Dragooning, the Popi&s;h Burnings, the
Heathen Torturings that we read of in the
World, &s;carce ever came up to this. In all
tho&s;e ca&s;es, the Sufferers were brought before
Judges and Magi&s;trates, Officers of Ju&s;tice, and
Men in Power. But &s;uch was the Thir&s;t of
I Blood here, that they appeared willing to &s;trip
them&s;elves of their Magi&s;terial Authority, and
make every private Sentinel, every Mu&s;quetier,
both Judge, Jury, and Executioner.</P>
<P>Never was Ju&s;tice Executed in &s;uch a &s;um|mary
Way as on this Occa&s;ion: For, now the
Soldiers fill'd the Streets and High-Ways with
Blood: Men, Women, nay, and little Children
were dragg'd out of their Hou&s;es, from their
Shops, Trades and Labour to immediate Death,
without Warning, without Pity, and without
Time given them to call upon God for Mercy
to their Souls.</P>
<P>Nor was the Life of the mo&s;t Innocent Per&s;on
&s;afe at this Time from the Rapine of the Sol|diers:
For now, it was the ea&s;ie&s;t Thing in
the World for private Revenge to be pur&s;ued to
Blood; and it was in the Power of the Sol|diers
to execute the greate&s;t Villany with Im|$punity:
They had no more to do but to
Rob, Ravi&s;h, In&s;ult, Plunder, and commit what
<PB N="218" REF="317">
Wickedne&s;s they plea&s;ed, and adding Murther
to the re&s;t, &s;ay, the Per&s;on Murther'd, refu&s;ed
to an&s;wer the Que&s;tions.</P>
<P>The&s;e Que&s;tions model'd according to the
Heads before recited, were thus,</P>
<P>1. Will you renounce the Covenant?</P>
<P>2. Will you Pray for the King, or will you
&s;ay God ble&s;s the King?</P>
<P>3. Was the Killing the Archbi&s;hop of St. <HI>An|drews</HI>
Murther, yea or no?</P>
<P>4. Was the ri&s;ing at <HI>Bothwel Brigg</HI> Rebellion,
yea or no?</P>
<P>It &s;hould have been ob&s;erv'd before this, that
in order effectually to &s;uppre&s;s the&s;e per&s;ecuted
People, and to fini&s;h the ruin of the Country,
the Government had rai&s;ed what the Country
People call'd the <HI>Highland Ho&s;t.</HI> The Account
the Per&s;ecutors gave of this was, &startq;That the
' <HI>Loyal Clans</HI> offered their Service to his Maje&s;ty,
to bring into the Field a body of Men, from
among their Va&s;&s;als and Servants, compleatly
arm'd, who were to march whether his Maje|&s;ty
&s;hould plea&s;e to command them, for the
&s;uppre&s;&s;ing of the Rebellion, and for pre|venting
the Rebels and Whigs from gathering
in Troops, in the We&s;tern Shires.&endq;</P>
<P>On the&s;e pretence's, tho&s;e <HI>Highlanders,</HI> little
better than Barbarians, and in &s;ome Ca&s;es much
wor&s;e, were arm'd and taken into the Service
of <HI>Satan,</HI> and &s;ome time after the <HI>Bothwel Brigg</HI>
affair, were order'd to the Number of 8000
Men to Quarter upon the &s;uffering People, in
the Shires of <HI>Air, Galloway,</HI> and other the We|&s;tern
Shires: There they exercis'd all the Ra|pine,
Violence, Robbery and Wickedne&s;s, over
and above the Murther, and &s;hedding of innocent
<PB N="219" REF="318">
Blood, of which we are ju&s;t going to &s;peak, that
may be expected from an ungovern'd Souldiery,
or that could be practi&s;ed upon, or &s;uffered by a
People, given up to the lu&s;t and rage of a crew
of Savages.</P>
<P>In this po&s;ture &s;tood the publick Affairs as to
the Persecutors, yet their rage receiv'd no a|batement;
the very thought of the Spirit, and
undepre&s;s'd courage of the Per&s;ecuted, gall'd and
exa&s;perated them: To &s;ee a &s;et of Men living
like wild Creatures in the Mountains, and yet
there in &s;pite of human Power, freely pre&s;er|ved
the Liberty of their Principles, and met
publickly and frequently in mighty Numbers,
for the wor&s;hip of God; and that it was impo&s;|&s;ible
for them, either to apprehend or prevent
them; this provok'd them to the la&s;t Degree:
They found now, that as the&s;e wandring Out|law'd
People mu&s;t be, and indeed &s;o they really
were harbour'd and reliev'd at the greate&s;t Peril
by the People in the plain Country, the only
way left to extirpate them more effectually, was
to ruin and impoveri&s;h the whole Country, that
the bani&s;h'd pro&s;crib'd Refugees, might have
no relief from them; and to make it puni&s;hable
in the highe&s;t manner, and as the mo&s;t capital
Crime for any &s;o much as to talk with, much
le&s;s entertain, comfort, relieve and &s;upport one
of tho&s;e, who, <HI>as they call it,</HI> were intercom$|$un'd;
and this was &s;o &s;everely put in Execution,
that we find among their li&s;ts of their Butchery's
by the Hangman; one <HI>Ram&s;ey</HI> executed only
for going over a River in a Ferry Boat, with one
who had been a Rebel, and talking with him in
common, as with other Men in the Boat.</P>
<P>But all the&s;e cruelties were not yet able to ex|$irpate
a race of Men, By who&s;e Sufferings
<PB N="220" REF="319">
the Grace and Mercy of God, was to be made
&s;o con&s;picuous in the World: NAY &s;o far
was it from than, that on the other hand, the
Numbers of them daily encrea&s;ed, even under
their very Per&s;ecutions, as was the Ca&s;e in the
Primitive times of the Church, their Field
Meetings grew more frequented, and were
more publickly held, and that with &s;uch Mul|titudes
as were &s;carce credible to relate.</P>
<P>Nor were the zealous per&s;ecuted People pre|vailed
upon, to abate one Tittle of the Te&s;ti|mony,
which they thought them&s;elves oblig'd
to bear again&s;t the Wickedne&s;s of their Ene|mies,
and that particularly in two Points.</P>
<P>1. Their National Perjury in breaking their
Oath to God, and to his People; (<HI>viz.</HI>) in break$
and renouncing the Covenant.</P>
<P>2. Their erecting an Epi&s;copal Church, Go|vernment
which they abhorr'd, and which the&s;e
treated with no other Name than an Anti-chri&s;tian
Prelacy.</P>
<Q><HI>Note,</HI> They ju&s;tified the Term Anti-chri&s;tian,
for the Prelatick Hierarchy owning the Su|premacy
of the King over the Church,
whereas they allowed Chri&s;t Je&s;us to be the
only Head and King of the Church on
Earth.</Q>
<P>On the other Hand tho&s;e two Articles, and
e&s;pecially the open and daring Profe&s;&s;ion
O$ them, by the&s;e per&s;ecuted People, was un|&s;ufferable,
and to the la&s;t Degree provo|king
to their Per&s;ecutors; and the more in tha$
they could neither by all their Cruelties, and
mo&s;t inhuman U&s;age, deter either tho&s;e that
<PB N="221" REF="320">
dyed to abate their open Dete&s;tation of the&s;e
two Things, at their Execution, or tho&s;e that
remained to refrain their open Profe&s;&s;ion of the
&s;ame abhorrences, no not for fear of the &s;ame
Tortures.</P>
<P>Nor could they by all their bloody pro&s;ecuti|ons
prevent the Field Meetings they &s;o much
exclaimed again&s;t, where the resolution of the
per&s;ecuted People, to per&s;evere to their Death,
in their oppo&s;ition to the Prelates, and their ad|hering
to the Covenant, was always expre&s;'d
in &s;uch Terms, and the People were &s;o con|firm'd
in tho&s;e re&s;olutions, that the Council
&s;aw too plainly nothing but Death could put an
End to it; and the whole race of &s;uffering Chri|&s;tians
mu&s;t be de&s;troy'd and extirpated, or they
&s;hould never Conquer the Oppo&s;ition they made
to the Planting of Epi&s;copacy in that Kingdom,
and upon this re&s;olution they proceeded.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Poor People, as if the
heat of the Per&s;ecution had but &s;erved to in|fluence
their Zeal, thought them&s;elves oblig'd
to declare a War, tho' of a different Nature a|gain&s;t
their Per&s;ecutors; and to let them &s;ee,
that upon a ju&s;t and equal Principle, they could
clear them&s;elves of the Guilt charg'd upon
them, of being Rebels again&s;t Lawful Autho|rity;
and to this end at one of their publick and
mo&s;t numerous Meetings in the We&s;t, they o|penly
declar'd them&s;elves revolted fvoin the
Government, ' renounced, and di&s;own'd all
Allegiance, Obedience, Homage or Duty to
the King and his Admini&s;tration; as being an
Enemy to God and to the Church of God, and
therefore not legally constituted, or to be ac|knowledg'd
as their Supream Lord. But <HI>Ip&s;o
Jure</HI> depo&s;ed, from all Regal Authortiy over
<PB N="222" REF="321">
them, and dive&s;ted of the Office of a Magi|&s;trate,
and of the Tru&s;t or Charge of Govern|ment
which was repo&s;ed in and devolved
upon him, by expre&s;s Compact, at his Coro|nation,
when he &s;olemnly entred into an Oath
and Covenant, with God and his People;
and which Oath, Covenant and Compact he
had violated, breaking all the Conditions, and
impiou&s;ly renouncing the Obligation thereof,
upon which Oath and the Obligation thereof,
all his regal Authority and their Allegiance,
were entirely founded; and upon the Breach
whereof, their &s;ubjection which was limited
to the provi&s;ions of tho&s;e Compacts and Co|venants
was explicitly di&s;engaged and remit|ted.&endq;</P>
<P>This was 'tis true a bold &s;tep, and many of
their Brethren &s;eem'd to cen&s;ure them upon
&s;uch a de&s;perate proceeding, but it &s;eems they
were only &s;uch who had Accepted the Li|berty
mentioned before upon the Terms of
Licen&s;e from the Prelates which tempo|ri&s;ing
and cowardly Complyance, the&s;e zea|lous
People abhorr'd as Sinful, and condemn'd
as a fainting in Gods Cau&s;e, giving over their
Constancy, and above all, as a wicked recogni|tion
of that Epi&s;copal Authority, from which
they receiv'd &s;uch Licen&s;e; This they call'd
Homologating the Legality of what they
them&s;elves Condemn'd as Anti-&s;cripturial
and Anti-chri&s;tian, and which they were engaged i$
the &s;olemne&s;t manner by the Covenant, never $word$
permit, much le&s;s &s;ubmit to in the Nation.</P>
<P>The Cen&s;ure of &s;uch therefore was of $word$
Value to them, and they in&s;i&s;ted upon $word$
right they had to declare, their revolt fro$
their Allegiance to King <HI>Cha.</HI> II. as their natur|al
<PB N="223" REF="322">
Privilege, and as the ju&s;t con&s;equence of
his Breach of the Compact of Government.</P>
<P>The noi&s;e the Council made of this Declara|tion,
was &s;trange indeed, how they declared
the&s;e People Rebels, Mad, Enrag'd, <HI>Scelerates,
&amp;c.</HI> People to be abhorr'd by Chri&s;tians, and
to be rooted out from the general Society of
Mankind, <HI>and the like;</HI> and &s;eem'd to ju&s;tify all
the inhumanities they at that time re&s;olv'd to
practice upon them, and to Legitimate all their
Extra-judicial Mea&s;ures, by the clamour they
rai&s;ed upon them, for this one Action; not fore-&s;eeing
that in a few Years tho&s;e &s;ame Men
&s;hould do the &s;ame thing, with the next King of
the &s;ame Race, and call for a Regiment of tho&s;e
&s;ame hone&s;t per&s;ecuted Sufferers, whom they
had thus damn'd for Rebels and Parricides, to
guard them in the doing it, <HI>as was within the
&s;pace of 12 Years, the very Ca&s;e,</HI> as I &s;hall &s;hew in
its order.</P>
<P>In this &s;olemn revolt, or renouncing their Al|legiance,
they repeated the &s;everal Acts of Vi|olence
and Oppre&s;&s;ion, which had been practi&s;ed
or authoriz'd by the King, and by his wicked
Coun&s;ellors, whereby he unhinged all the legal
E&s;tabli&s;hment of their Religion, and &s;ubverted all
their Religious Liberties: The Kings Supremacy,
they call'd a Bla&s;phemous and Sacrilegious; Usur|pation
being an illegal Anti-&s;cripturial Dominion
over the In&s;titution of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and the Ordi|nances
of his own Divine Appointment.</P>
<P>They proceed to declare, that tlie King had
overturn'd all the Fundamental part of the
Civil Constitution, &s;ubverting the Laws and
Liberties of the People, destroying their Civil
and Natural Rights, and all the Securities of
Life and Enjoyment what&s;oever; and that all
<PB N="224" REF="323">
this was by claiming and a&s;&s;uming a right to an
Ab&s;olute, Tyrannical Arbitrary Government,
by his pretended Prerogative, independent of
Law, and &s;uperior thereto; all which they de|clare
to be illegal and incon&s;i&s;tent with the
Safety, Freedom, and legal Privileges of the
People, and with the Oath and Obligation of a
King.</P>
<P>The&s;e and many other things they gave, as
the rea&s;on of their revolt from, and renouncing
Allegiance to the King, which I am the more
particular in, becau&s;e of their affinity to, and
the &s;anction they &s;oon after receiv'd from the ge|neral
Practi&s;e of the whole I&s;land, and al&s;o to add
this remark, <HI>viz.</HI> How the&s;e poor People were
not only handled by their Enemies, but even
cen&s;ur'd by their Friends, for owning tho&s;e very
Principles at that time, upon which the Safety
of the who&s;e Nation was found in a few Years
to depend; and for profe&s;&s;ing &s;uch Opinions, as
in &s;o little a while were judged e&s;&s;ential to the
publick Safety, and on which to this Day, our
<HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Con&s;titution is founded <HI>viz.</HI> That Ty|rants
and Arbitrary per&s;ecuting Princes may be
Renounc'd, the People may revolt from their
Allegiance to them, depo&s;e them from their u|&s;urp'd
Authority, and yet cannot be ju&s;tly call'd
Rebels and Traytors: <HI>Witne&s;s the Revolution and</HI>
Prote&s;tant <HI>Succe&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>But asking Pardon for this needful Digre&s;&s;ion,
I return to the &s;uffering People, who however
righteous the Principles were which they acted
from were, yet for &s;ome Years to Drink the Dregs
of <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> and Tyrannical Per&s;ecution, to the full
Tryal of their Faith and Patience. For Example,</P>
<P>After they had thus declar'd their revolt
from, and renounced their Allegiance to the
<PB N="225" REF="324">
King, and his In&s;truments of Tyranny, they
proceeded in a &s;olemn manner to pronounce the
greater Excommunication, in which they Ex|communicated
the King, and the Bi&s;hops, a|mong
the Enemies and Contemners of God and
his Church. They likewi&s;e in the &s;ame Decla|ration
prote&s;ted again&s;t a <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Succe&s;&s;or; and
declar'd that they would never receive the Duke
of <HI>York</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> nor admit him to po&s;&s;e&s;s the
Crown.</P>
<P>Thus I have given the Reader an abridg'd
Relation of what was done on their part. But
what Tongue can expre&s;s, or Pen de&s;cribe the
U&s;age the&s;e poor People received, and the Cru|elties
they &s;uffer'd on this Account. &startq;Not only
Time, <HI>&s;ays a &s;olid Writer of that Day,</HI> but
Heart and Tongue would fail any Chri&s;tian
to relate all the Violences, Murthers, Plun|derings,
Extortions, and In&s;olencies, that from
the beginning of this Per&s;ecution have been
committed in a military way, be&s;ides what
has been done in the form and cour&s;e of pub|lick
pretended Ju&s;tice: IF &s;tabbing, wounding,
beating, &s;tripping, and impri&s;oning Mens
per&s;ons: IF violent breaking into their Hou|&s;es
in the dead of the Night; beating, woun|ding,
ravi&s;hing, and inhumanely abu&s;ing Wives
and Daughters. IF forcing weak Women by
Tortures, &s;uch as burning Matches, and other
un&s;ufferable Torments to di&s;cover, nay accu&s;e
their Husbands, Fathers, and deare&s;t Relations.
IF driving away their Cattle, &s;poiling their
Goods without re&s;pect to Guilt or Innocence;
and this in as cruel a manner as ever <HI>Scotland</HI>
had &s;een, or could have &s;een, had a foreign
Army been in the bowels of their Country.
IF all the&s;e, and many more &s;uch may expre&s;s
<PB N="226" REF="325">
our Mi&s;ery, <HI>&s;ays this Author,</HI> &s;ome Gue&s;s may
be made at the Sufferings of this Church from
the Malice and Fury of this wicked prevail|ing
Prelatick party.&endq;</P>
<P>But we now come to the methods taken with
tho&s;e per&s;ons who they could by no other
means lay hold upon. The&s;e con&s;i&s;ted of two
&s;orts, (1.) Tho&s;e who having been in Arms,
and had e&s;caped the Sword of Battle, were fled
to the Mountains: Or, (2.) tho&s;e who having
been mark'd out for Destruction by their Per&s;e|cutors
were withdrawn to the other: Tho&s;e
Men holding fa&s;t their Integrity, and having
many Mini&s;ters among them, kept up their
Field-preachings, and enjoy'd the Free|dom
of their Religious Exerci&s;es, notwith|&s;tanding
the mo&s;t inveterate Rage of their Ene|mies;
and this, as I &s;aid already, provok'd the
Per&s;ecutors to &s;uch a Degree that they were not
able to contain them&s;elves, but would flye at the
Innocent to puni&s;h the Guilty, that is to &s;ay, who
they &s;uppos'd guilty,for other Guilt they had none.</P>
<P>To puni&s;h them then as far as they were able,
&s;eeing they could do it no other way; <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> they
intercommuned them, as they call it, forbid|ding
any Per&s;on to harbour, hide, comfort, or
corre&s;pond with any of them; or even &s;o much
as to &s;alute, or talk with them on the way, on
pain of Trea&s;on and Rebellion; and of being pro|&s;ecuted
for the &s;ame Crimes which tho&s;e they &s;o
harbour'd, comforted, or corre&s;ponded with
were charg'd with.</P>
<P>In the next place to di&s;appoint them who were
wandring about in Sheep-skins and Goat-skins,
in Dens, and Holes, and Caves of the Earth; and
effectually to prevent their being reliev'd &s;up|ported
from their Friends, Relations, or other|wi&s;e;
<PB N="227" REF="326">
they found it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary by
Troops of Soldiers who were &s;ub&s;i&s;ted by the poor
Sufferers, to ruin and impoveri&s;h the Country by
their various Plunderings and Depredations, ra|ther
like Troops in an Enemy's Country, than
Troops Billited and placed under Di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>This was the Ca&s;e when Ju&s;tice was transferr'd
from the Judges on the Bench to the Soldier in the
Field; and this not to the Officers, to the Court
Martial, or A&s;&s;embly of Officers, or Generals; but
to the brutal common Soldiers, who neither had
Con&s;cience to judge by, Rea&s;on to judge from,
Sen&s;e to guide, Humanity to &s;pare, or Temper to
con&s;ider who to kill, and who to &s;ave.</P>
<P>It would be endle&s;s to turn this Account into
a <HI>Scots</HI> Martyrology, or a Regi&s;ter of Barbarities.
The&s;e Sheets are no way equal to a Hi&s;tory of
&s;uch a length; but keeping my&s;elf to the Brevity
of Memoirs. <HI>Agreeable to my Title,</HI> I &s;hall give
&s;ome Specimens of the bloody management of
this part of the Work; I mean as to this new
fa&s;hioned way of Per&s;ecution, by delivering a
naked defencele&s;s People up to the Fury of the
common Soldiers; and &s;ome flagrant In&s;tances
of this kind will be &s;ufficient to de&s;cribe the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t I meet with is the Story of a poor
Woman and a young Maiden of about 16 Years
old in the We&s;t of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who were cruelly mur|thered
by &s;ome Men belonging to <HI>Grier&s;on</HI> of <HI>Log,</HI>
an Eminent Per&s;ecutor in that part of the Coun|try.
They began by putting the Que&s;tions to
them abovemention'd; and the fir&s;t they offered,
<HI>as what was mo&s;t popular at that Time in the World,
and be&s;t &s;erv'd, as they thought, to expo&s;e the per&s;c|cuted
People to the Court,</HI> was that of, <HI>Will ye &s;ay
God ble&s;s the King.</HI> As I have receiv'd this Story
from Creditable Witne&s;&s;es, take it as follows;
<PB N="228" REF="327">
The Woman told them &s;he would pray to God
to forgive the King his Sins: The Maid &s;aid
&s;he would pray that God would plea&s;e to give
the King Repentance: But <HI>it would be an impious
Thing,</HI> &s;aid the Woman, <HI>to pray to God to &s;ave,</HI>
that is, <HI>to ble&s;s a Covenant-breaking perjur'd Magi|&s;trate,</HI>
and in the Pro&s;ecution of his Perjury too:
And they both declar'd it was again&s;t their Con|&s;ciences,
their Principles, and the Covenant;
and that therefore <HI>they could not do it.</HI> The Wo|man
&s;aid boldly, That while the King was <HI>a Per|&s;ecutor
of God's People</HI> he was an Enemy to <HI>GOD</HI>
and to the Church of <HI>GOD;</HI> and &s;he thought it
was an abominable Thing to ask of any Chri&s;tian
to pray for Pro&s;perity <HI>to the Per&s;ecutors of the Church
of Chri&s;t;</HI> for that was to &s;ay <HI>God &s;peed to them,</HI>
Even in the very Per&s;ecution it&s;elf: She was an
undaunted Woman, and challeng'd them to an|&s;wer
her in that particular; but they had no|thing
to &s;ay to her Argument, but thought &s;he
would have &s;ome Regard to theirs which was,
<HI>Pray to God to ble&s;s the King&mdash;or dye. Will ye
kill me,</HI> &s;ays the Woman, <HI>becau&s;e I will not ble&s;s
tho&s;e who God cur&s;es! the Lord forbid that I &s;hould do
it, tho' I were to dye a Thou&s;and Times.</HI> Upon this
they fix'd a Stake in the Sea at the low Water
Mark, and binding the poor Woman and the
young Girl to the Stake, let them &s;tand there
'till the Tide flowed over them and drowned
them both, being al&s;o tormented almo&s;t to Death
with the Cold by &s;tanding in the Water &s;o long
as 'till the Tide was high enough to drown them.
However, they both endur'd it with great Con|&s;tancy,
and withour the lea&s;t Offer of Compliance
with the barbarous Adver&s;ary.</P>
<P>It has been matter of Cen&s;ure among &s;ome, and
even of tho&s;e otherwi&s;e in the &s;ame Intere&s;t, and
<PB N="229" REF="328">
of the &s;ame doctrinal Principles with tho&s;e Peo|ple;
when they found that they were &s;o &s;everely
nice in this particular of praying for the King;
&s;eeing they are bid <HI>to pray for Kings and all in Au|thority.</HI>
But not to make the&s;e Memoirs enter
into long Di&s;putes of the Points between them
and their Per&s;ecutors, which is not the work of
a Hi&s;torian. I &s;hall only &s;tate and remove the
Que&s;tion in few Words from the&s;e poor Sufferers
to their Enemies, and leave them to an&s;wer it if
they know how.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, it is true they began with the&s;e
poor Women upon that Que&s;tion of praying for
the King, which was a piece of wicked Policy on
their parts; becau&s;e it was the mo&s;t popular Que|&s;tion,
and by which they thought they made
the&s;e People odious to the King, and repre&s;ented
them as his particular Enemies; and per&s;uaded
him by it to let them go on with their Per&s;ecu|tion,
which <HI>by the way</HI> they had much ado to pre|vail
in; for the King who was in him&s;elf of a
merciful Di&s;po&s;ition, being often &s;hock'd with the
Accounts of their Cruelties and often &s;aying o|penly
he would have no more Blood &s;hed. <HI>I &s;ay,</HI>
this was a wicked Policy on their Part; for
'tis known they had Three or Hour Que|&s;tions
more in their Orders; any of which
were of &s;uch a Nature, as that the poor Peo|ple
would have &s;uffred Death rather than to
have comply'd: for Example, had the&s;e Two
poor Women an&s;wer'd, <HI>Yes, we will &s;ay God &s;ave
the King;</HI> the next Que&s;tion had been, <HI>Will ye
renounce the Covenant?</HI> a Que&s;tion, which if it
were now ask'd in <HI>Scotland,</HI> I believe there are
50000 People would as &s;oon renounce the very
Name of Chri&s;tians; <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> they would
&s;uffer all that humane Nature could &s;uffer rather
<PB N="230" REF="329">
than do it. So that upon the whole, the&s;e People
did not &s;uffer for a &s;ingle Opposition of the King's
Lawful Authority as was wickedly charg'd on
them; but they were given up to Death by a
Party, and they &s;ingl'd out &s;uch points to que&s;tion
them upon as they knew they could not comply
with, that they might de&s;troy them; and if the&s;e
Que&s;tions would not have done it, they would
have named others for the Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Farther, it is evident that they refu&s;ed pray|ing
for the King upon a Religious Principle, not
upon a Rebellious Principle; and that as they
believed the King, <HI>as before,</HI> to be an Idolater,
a Per&s;ecutor; and an Enemy to God and his
People. They believ'd that for them to pray
for God to ble&s;s him would be either to mock
God by &s;eeming to pray for what they did not
mean, or really to pray to God to ble&s;s the King,
even in his persecuting God's People, which
would be impious, and was again&s;t their Con|&s;ciences.</P>
<P>As to the other part which <HI>the Objectors alledge,
viz.</HI> it was a Trifle, and a Thing &s;o &s;mall as that
they could not an&s;wer to lo&s;e their Lives for it;
we an&s;wer that then much le&s;s could tho&s;e Cruel
and Inhumane Per&s;ecutors an&s;wer to take the
Lives of poor innocent Women and Children a|way
for &s;o &s;mall a Thing, which in the common
Judgment, and by their own Confe&s;&s;ion, was but
a Trifle in its Nature.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e if it was again&s;t the Consciences and
Principles of the poor People, <HI>tho' we were to &s;uppo&s;e
them mi&s;inform'd</HI> or uninform'd; yet they dyed in a
Righteous Cau&s;e, not as they dyed for refu&s;ing to
pray for the King; but as they cho&s;e to dye rather
than to violate their Obedience to the Sovereign|ty
of Con&s;cience, which is a Principle every
Chri&s;tian ought to adhere $o.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="330">
Let the&s;e things &s;erve for An&s;wers <HI>'till they can
be</HI> con&s;uted, to the Per&s;ecutors them&s;elves, and to
all tho&s;e who would blacken the Memory of the&s;e
Con&s;cientious and Zealous People, pretending
they were Ob&s;tinate, that they threw away their
Lives, and that they dyed upon Foundations and
Principles which are not to be ju&s;tified; it is
evident they were right in their adhering &s;ted|fa&s;tly
to the known Duty of a Chri&s;tian, <HI>viz. of
&s;uffering the greate&s;t Evil rather than committing the
lea&s; Sin.</HI> Nay, tho' they were to have it granted,
that they were, <HI>as I &s;aid above,</HI> mi&s;inform'd in
the Nature of the Thing they &s;uffer'd for: It
might be ob&s;erved here, that it was the very
Argument u&s;ed with many of the primitive
Martyrs in the Time of the Ten Per&s;ecutions:
That it was a &s;mall Thing but to take a Cen&s;or
in their Hands, <HI>to &s;eem as if</HI> they did &s;acrifice,
<HI>tho' they did not;</HI> That the Prayer to the Gods
was made by the Prie&s;ts, and it was a Thing of
no Con&s;equence to bow the Head, which they
might do as to <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> and not as to the Gods
above; Thus al&s;o in the Ca&s;e of the Martyr'd
<HI>Maccabees,</HI> their Per&s;ecutors pretended in Clemen|cy
to offer them their Lives, if they would but
take a bit of Swine's Fle&s;h into their Mouths,
tho' they did not &s;wallow it down. But with
what Abhorrence did they <HI>REF&V;SE!</HI> with what
joy and Alacrity did they dye! mean the pri|mitive
Chri&s;tians as well as the <HI>Maccabees:</HI> In&s;o|much
that the wi&s;e&s;t of the Heathen condemn'd
them as Fools; for that they ca&s;t them&s;elves
away, and lo&s;t their Lives, not for the E&s;&s;ential
parts of Religion, but for Trifles and Circum|&s;tances
of no Con&s;equence.</P>
<P>I might in&s;i&s;t here upon the evident Te&s;ti|mony,
that God was plea&s;ed to give even from
<PB N="232" REF="331">
Heaven to the&s;e &s;uffering People; that the of|fering
up their Lives in this Ca&s;e was an accep|table
Sacrifice to Him, and a rea&s;onable Service
in them: And this Te&s;timony was by an almo&s;t
univer&s;al A&s;&s;i&s;tance given them in their Suffer|ings,
filling them with abundant Strength to un|dergo,
Patience to bear, and Comfort, even to
Joy and Tryumph under the &s;evere&s;t and cruel|le&s;t
Torments that their mo&s;t inhumane Per&s;e|cutors
could inflict. I take this from an Author
who was an Eye-Witne&s;s of, and a Fellow-Suf|ferer
in much of it; and therefore give the fol|lowing
Account in his own Words, and from his
own Ob&s;ervation, <HI>as follows$</HI></P>
<P>&startq;We &s;hall not, indeed cannot, enter upon the
particular Declaration of that Grace, Con|&s;tancy,
and Courage, by which the Lord's
faithful Witne&s;&s;es were-&s;u&s;tain'd, and by which
they did bear Te&s;timony to the Word of His
Truth: Only this is certain, that many of
them, tho' illiterate and ob&s;cure Men, and that
when they came to the Scaffold they were hur|ry'd
and interrupted by the Order of the Pre|lates
and Council, and by the Cruelty and In|humanity
of the Executioners and Officers at|tending;
yet they did bear Witne&s;s to the
Cau&s;e of God, and of that Grace and A&s;&s;urance
whereby the Lord upheld them to the Admi|ration
and A&s;toni&s;hment of all the Beholders.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That at <HI>Gla&s;gow and Air,</HI> where Eleven of
them were Executed, all mean Countrymen;
&s;ome very ancient, &s;ome not above 17 Years
old; and that their Enemies cau&s;ed Drums to
be beat round the Scaffold, that they might
not be heard; yet were they &s;o little thereby
amaz'd, or di&s;order'd, that as well by Words
of Prai&s;e and Thank&s;giving to God, when they
<PB N="233" REF="332">
might be heard; and by their Countenances, Ge|&s;tures,
and other Carriage they did bear &s;uch
Te&s;timony to the Truth, as that thereby many
were confirm'd, and their Enemies were made
a&s;ham'd.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Likewi&s;e tho' &s;ome at other Times did ap|pear
weak and faint-hearted at fir&s;t, yet &s;o
powerfully and abundantly was it given to
them <HI>in that Hour,</HI> that out of Weakne&s;s they
were made &s;trong; and declar'd often, that
they had &s;uch Di&s;coveries of God's Glory be|tween
the Pri&s;on and the Gibbet, that all
fear was thereby di&s;cu&s;&s;ed: And particularly
a poor Country Boy, who they Condemn'd at
<HI>Air</HI> for refu&s;ing the Declaration, which they
told him was a Renouncing the Covenant that
he had taken at <HI>Lanerck.</HI> This Child thro'
Fear, and particularly Ignorance of the Grounds
Of Chri&s;tianity, was in great Agonies upon his
Soul's Account, greatly fearing to dye, yet not
daring to redeem his Life on the Terms offer'd.
But after the Prayers and Conference of &s;ome
good People that had Acce&s;s to him at <HI>Irwin</HI>
two Days before he dy'd, he appear'd &s;o much
changed, that on the Morning of has Execution
in&s;tead of the Depth of Fear and Perplexity,
the obtained a full Resolution and Joy &s;o
much inlightned with the Knowledge of God
in and thro' our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and with
the Hope of Salvation thro' His Name; that all
that law him, do bear Teftimony to the Grace
and wonderful Work of God in his Heart;
whereby he went to the Scaffold with Joy,
leaping and prai&s;ing God.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;From all which, and the &s;everal Te&s;timonies
and Speeches which the&s;e left behind them in
Writing, we conclude and rejoyce, that God
<PB N="234" REF="333">
out of the dark Cloud of &s;uch a &s;ad and a&s;to|ni&s;hing
Providence which has now over&s;pread
us, hath brought forth &s;o ble&s;&s;ed and &s;o bright
a Cloud of Witne&s;&s;es, &s;trengthened and fill'd
with &s;o much Grace and Glory to bear Te&s;ti|mony
to His Name <HI>Covenant</HI> and Cau&s;e for
the Confirmation of all that love and wait for
His Salvation.&endq;</P>
<P>A further Te&s;timony of this will be &s;een in the
Speeches of &s;ome of the Sufferers at the place of
Execution; of which in its Order.</P>
<P>But to return to our Memoirs of Fact, the fir&s;t
Thing the <HI>Highland</HI> Forces were empowered to
do, was to pre&s;s from all the People where they
had any Knowledge of their being <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> or
of their having <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in their Families, a
<HI>BOND of Conformity,</HI> as they call'd it; wherein
every Per&s;on entring into the &s;aid Bond was
bound, not only for him&s;elf, but all under him,
<HI>viz.</HI> Wife, Children and Servants, to frequent
and keep to his <HI>Parochial Kirk,</HI> or <HI>Pari&s;h-Church,</HI>
and never to go either to any Hou&s;e or Field-Meeting;
nor <HI>re&s;ett,</HI> that is, receive or entertain
any that did &s;o, on any Pretence what&s;oever; al&s;o
to inform again&s;t, and to deliver up if in their
power, all the Mini&s;ters or Preachers, that exer|ci&s;ed
the Office of a Mini&s;ter or Preacher, in
any &s;uch Meeting or A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>Many thro' Fear, complyed with the&s;e unrea|sonable
Conditions; not being able to bear the
ruin of their Families, and the &s;everity of a
Flight into the Mountains, in the Winter Sea|&s;on;
where they had no Comfort or Relief, but
&s;truggled with the extremities of Cold, Hun|ger
and Di&s;ea&s;es, occa&s;ion'd by damp Places to
lodge in, want of Nece&s;&s;aries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But others
re&s;olving to &s;uffer every thing, that Nature was
<PB N="235" REF="334">
able to &s;upport, to pre&s;erve a good Con&s;cience,
fled to the Mountains, where they had to their
Lot exactly what is described in the 11th of the
<HI>Hebrews,</HI> ver. 37, 38. <HI>They wandered about in
Sheep-skins and Goat-skins, being de&s;titute, afflicted,
tormented; they wandered in De&s;arts, and in Moun|tains,
and in Dens and Caves of the Earth.</HI> This
was their Portion, and by this means the Towns
were left uninhabited, the Villages de&s;olate, the
Lands unlabour'd, <HI>i. e.</HI> uncultivated, and the
riche&s;t, mo&s;t populous, and, in Proportion, the
fruitfulle&s;t Part of <HI>Scotland,</HI> became a kind of
Wilderne&s;s, and like a Hou&s;e without the In|habitant.</P>
<P>By this Means however, and by the Ri&s;ing at
<HI>Bothwell, mention'd before,</HI> the Number of tho&s;e
Refugees in the Mountains encrea&s;ed, and the
Meetings in the Fields for Publick Wor&s;hip were
more frequent, which &s;till exa&s;perated the Per|&s;ecutors;
and they, being enraged, omitted no
Cruelty, no Inju&s;tice, no Inhumanity, for the
De&s;truction of them: They very well knew that
the People lurking in the Mountains mu&s;t of Ne|ce&s;&s;ity
receive Supplies of Food and Clothes,
either from their own Families and Friends
which were left behind, or of Charity from
others; and therefore as fir&s;t they took care
effectually, by Plunder and Rapine, to leave
nothing in the Hou&s;es of tho&s;e that were fled,
&s;o they per&s;ecuted with the utmo&s;t Rigour all
that were but &s;u&s;pected of harbouring or re|lieving them.</P>
<P>I &s;hall begin with the Pri&s;oners taken at <HI>Bothwell.</HI>
Mr. <HI>Kid</HI> and Mr. <HI>King,</HI> as has been &s;aid, and &s;e|veral
others, were executed as Traytors; and,
as if their Cruelty had been &s;atisfy'd, it was re|&s;olv'd
in Council to Tran&s;port the re&s;t into the
<PB N="236" REF="335">
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plantations. Upon the King's Orders and
under Pretence of this Tran&s;portation, there were
300 of the &s;aid Pri&s;oners put on hoard of a
Ship, in Order, as was &s;aid, to be &s;ent to the
<HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI> The&s;e are tho&s;e of whom Men|tion
is made already, Page 203. of whom this is
yet nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;aid, That altho' they were
publickly allow'd Tran&s;portation, yet it is cer|tain
nothing le&s;s than &s;o much Favour was de|&s;ign'd
them. Some have &s;aid that it was then
publickly known that the Council had, <HI>notwith|&s;tanding
the Order from</HI> England, determined the
Tran&s;ported People for Death; and, indeed, it
&s;eems more than probable, &s;eeing ($$efides what
is &s;aid before of their not having &s;ufficient Store
of Provi&s;ions in the Ship for &s;uch a Voyage)
they &s;ail'd Northward to go to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Co|lonies
in <HI>America</HI> directly from <HI>Scotland;</HI> which,
by the Constituted Law of tho&s;e Countries, <HI>cal|led
the Act of Navigation,</HI> could not be done,
neither would any of tho&s;e Colonies have re|ceived
them, but have &s;eized upon and forfeited
the Ship and Goods that came with them; &s;o
that it is certainly more than a Su&s;picion that
the poor People were de&s;ign'd for De&s;truction.
The Ca&s;e was thus, when the&s;e poor People, I
&s;ay, were put on board the Ship, and &s;ail'd out
of the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> it was expected they
&s;hould have gone directly to <HI>England,</HI> as Ships
bound to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plantations were always
u&s;ed to do, and as indeed they were obliged by
the Laws of <HI>England</HI> to do, <HI>as above;</HI> but, on the
contrary, they &s;ail'd Northward to the Coa&s;t of
the <HI>Orkneys,</HI> where, by Stre&s;s of Weather, <HI>as was
pretended,</HI> the Ship was driven among the Rocks,
and broken in pieces. The Ma&s;ter and Sea|men,
and the Per&s;ons, or Murtherers-rather,
<PB N="237" REF="336">
who had the Guard or Conducting of the Pri|&s;oners,
ea&s;ily got on Shore, as has been &s;aid;
and, had they been permitted, all the Pri&s;o|ners
might likewi&s;e have done the &s;ame; whereas
the Officer who had the Guard of the Pri&s;oners,
<HI>with</HI> the Ma&s;ter <HI>of the Ship,</HI> having, on Pretence of
Securing them, lock'd them all down under the
Hatches, would not, upon the mo&s;t earne&s;t and
moving Entreaties of even the Seamen and
others; nor the Shrieks and Cries of the poor
dying People, &s;uffer the Hatches to be opened,
or one of them to be let out.</P>
<P>It &s;eems there was one Seaman who ventur'd
his Life on board, when the Ship was ju&s;t
breaking to pieces, and, with an Axe cutting
his Way thro' the Side or Deck of the Ve&s;&s;el,
let about 50 out, who were every one &s;aved, but
the re&s;t all peri&s;hed, as before.</P>
<P>The be&s;t Excu&s;e that the Murtherers ever
gave for this, was, that they had &s;trict Orders,
what&s;oever Port they &s;hould go on Shore at,
not to let any of the Pri&s;oners go out of the
Ship: But this was &s;o trifling an Excu&s;e that
none could be &s;atisfy'd with it, for either <HI>they had</HI>
Orders, That tho' the Ship was &s;tranded or &s;plit
they &s;hould not let the Pri&s;oners out, or <HI>they had
not;</HI> if <HI>they had,</HI> it mu&s;t be with an Intent in
tho&s;e who gave tho&s;e Orders to have them pe|ri&s;h
in &s;uch Shipwreck, as it happen'd, and
would give a &s;hrewd Su&s;picion that &s;uch a Ship|wreck
was intended, e&s;pecially con&s;idering how
it afterwards came to pa&s;s. If no &s;uch Orders <HI>were</HI>
expre&s;ly <HI>given,</HI> then were the Officers Murther|ers;
for it could not be imagin'd that a general
Order not to let the Pri&s;oners go out of the
Ship, had any other Meaning, than that he
&s;hould u&s;e all Means po&s;&s;ible to prevent their
<PB N="238" REF="337">
E&s;cape; but not that they &s;hould be drown'd, or
that they &s;hould be kept in the Ship when &s;he
was &s;inking, any more than a <HI>Mittimus</HI> to a
Jaylor, wherein he is to have the Pri&s;oner in
&s;afe keeping within his Jayl, &s;uppo&s;e of <HI>New|gate,</HI>
or any other Pri&s;on) gives him Power, or
obliges him, if the Pri&s;on-hou&s;e &s;hould be on
Fire, to &s;uffer the Pri&s;oners to be burnt to
Death, rather than open the Doors to let them
out.</P>
<P>It is therefore very rea&s;onable to believe that
this wretched ln&s;trument, or Executioner, for
he could be no better, had his &s;ecret In&s;tru|ctions
from the bloody per&s;ecuting Council for
what was done; and that the Ship was knock'd
on the Head on purpo&s;e to drown, and cau&s;e to
peri&s;h, the Number of poor Sufferers who the
Clemency of the Sovereign had forbid to be put
Death in a Judicial way, and who yet the Ma|lice
and Rage of the Per&s;ecutors would not &s;uf|fer
to live.</P>
<P>Moreover, it has been creditably reported,
that tho&s;e who provided or furni&s;hed this Ve&s;|&s;el
out for her Voyage, acknowledg'd that &s;he
was not Victualled at all an Proportion to &s;o
long a Voyage, and &s;o large a Number of Peo|ple
as were on board; no, nor any thing like it;
nay, it has been &s;aid that there was not Provi|&s;ions
on board for the Pri&s;oners,&s;ufficient to keep
them alive 14 Days; which, if it is true, would
convince an Athei&s;t in &s;uch Things, that the
De&s;ign in putting the&s;e poor People on board,
was not to Tran&s;port, but to Murther them.</P>
<P>Another Argument is &s;till good al&s;o again&s;t
the Per&s;ecutors of that Time, <HI>viz.</HI> If they did
not approve of the Officers Murthering the&s;e
poor People, why were they not pro&s;ecuted and
<PB N="239" REF="338">
puni&s;hed for &s;o horrid and inhumane a Murther,
the like of which no Prote&s;tant Age or Country
can give the Hi&s;tory of? But, on the contrary,
the Ma&s;ter or Skipper, the officer of the Guards,
and all the re&s;t concern'd, had no Puni&s;hment,
no Reprimand, neither was any thing; done to
them, to let them or the World believe they
had not done them very good Service.</P>
<P>Thus peri&s;hed 250 of the&s;e good People; I
call them &s;o on this mo&s;t justifiable Foundation,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) becau&s;e that tho' they might have their
Lives and Liberties given them by the Sove|reign,
upon Terms, which, in Con&s;cience, they
could not comply with, they <HI>loved not their Lives,
to the Death,</HI> they <HI>refu&s;ed to accept of Deliverance:</HI>
And I call it Murther, becau&s;e, as it is well known
the King's expre&s;s Orders were that <HI>they &s;hould
not be put to Death,</HI> but be Tran&s;ported. The
&s;uffering them thus to peri&s;h, when it was ap|parent
their Lives might have been &s;aved, was
not a Murther only in the Officers, but a pre|meditated
malicious Murther in the Council,
who &s;o far conniv'd at and approv'd it, as ne|ver
to offer any Vindication of them&s;elves from
it, or any Re&s;entment again&s;t the guilty Per&s;ons;
for it is a Murther of the blacke&s;t and mo&s;t hor|rid
kind, and which, I think, as before, has not
its Parallel in any Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>It has been mentioned al&s;o, that there were
about 60 more of the&s;e Pri&s;oners put on board
another Ship for Tran&s;portation, who, there
being no &s;ecret De&s;ign to murther them, were
&s;uffer'd to go by the ordinary Method, and to
fail the u&s;ual Way (<HI>viz.</HI>) to <HI>England;</HI> where, as
it is already noted, &s;ome Difference happening
between the Ma&s;ter and Owner of the Ship,
&s;o that the Ship did not pur&s;ue her Voyage,
<PB N="240" REF="339">
and the Pri&s;oners having been made the Pro|perty
of the Owner, not of the Ma&s;ter; the
&s;aid Ma&s;ter thereupon, (being al&s;o a well in|clined
Per&s;on) open'd his Hatches, and let them
all go. I mention this again here on this Oc|ca&s;ion,
<HI>viz.</HI> that it was very ob&s;ervable, in their
Ca&s;e, that the Government here took no No|tice
of their E&s;cape, nor did the King order
any Search after them, or give any Order to re|take
them, if found: All which evidently
proves, that the Cruelties exerci&s;ed upon the&s;e
Sufferers in <HI>Scotland,</HI> proceeded from the Malice
and Rage of their Per&s;ecutors there, and neither
by the Direction or with the Approbation of the
King him&s;elf; not that this Clemency, which
in the King, was rather an Accident to his Na|ture
than a Virtue in his Government, can ex|cu&s;e
his permitting the&s;e cruel Per&s;ecutions,
which he had, doubtle&s;s, Power to prevent;
and therefore was, doubtle&s;s, guilty of the
Blood that was &s;pilt on that Occa&s;ion; which,
tho' his Inclination led him not to delight in,
yet his Indolence in Government, and his Apo|&s;tate
Principles, &s;uffer'd him to permit. But tho'
it is no Excu&s;e to him who&s;e Duty it was to
have put a Stop to the Stream of innocent Blood
&s;hed under his Authority, it was, on the other
hand, a convincing Evidence of the bloody Di&s;|po&s;ition
of his Mini&s;try in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who, thir&s;t|ing
for an Occa&s;ion to extirpate the very Name
of a <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Church out of <HI>Scotland,</HI> dip'd
their Hands in Blood in that mo&s;t inhumane
and unnatural manner, till they made all the
We&s;t of <HI>Scotland</HI> a Wilderne&s;s and a De&s;ola|tion.</P>
<P>This was the Proceeding again&s;t the <HI>Bothwell.</HI>
Bridge Pri&s;oners. We &s;hall now &s;ee what
<PB N="241" REF="340">
U&s;age they met with who had not been any
way concern'd in it.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, in their Pur&s;uit of the &s;uppo&s;ed Par|ties,
they e&s;tabli&s;hed little Inqui&s;itions; and, in|deed,
they were very properly called &s;o; for
they went round the Country in Circuits, where
they enquir'd not only who really and actually
were in the Rebellion, but who were &s;u&s;pected
or believed to be &s;o; and the&s;e they took Li&s;ts of,
make their Return upon; and after this they
&s;ummon'd them to appear before them, to clear
them&s;elves.</P>
<Q><P>If they did not appear, they reputed them
Guilty, and declared them to be Rebels
Convict.</P>
<P>If they did appear, they were examin'd why
they did not go to the King's Camp, in
order to fight again&s;t the Rebels; and, if
they did not give a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer to
tho&s;e Que&s;tions, they were committed to
Pri&s;on, in order to get others to accu&s;e
them; where many innocent Per&s;ons pe|ri&s;hed
by long and clo&s;e Confinement, tho'
nothing could be laid to their Charge.</P>
<P>If in the&s;e Examinations they effectually
clear'd them&s;elves of being in the Rebel|lion,
yet an incredible Number were en|&s;nar'd
with other unfore&s;een Enquiries;
&s;ome were Impri&s;on'd; &s;ome Fin'd above
the Value of their E&s;tates; others were
Condemn'd to Death, for having but &s;een
and &s;poken to any of the e&s;cap'd Rebels,
after they had fled from <HI>Bothwell</HI>-Bridge;
alledging that it was Trea&s;on &s;o to do, and
not to di&s;cover and apprehend them.</P>
<P>If neither by Examination, Confe&s;&s;ion, or De|lation,
<HI>&s;uper Inquirendis,</HI> &s;o it was termed
<PB N="242" REF="341">
in their Law,) they were able to reach
them, yet many &s;uch were Condemn'd and
Executed even for their Simple-declar'd
Opinion of it, according to the Que&s;tions
mention'd before, and which we &s;hall &s;peak
farther of pre&s;ently.</P></Q>
<P>Nor was the Number &s;mall or Incon&s;iderable
of tho&s;e who were thus dealt with: There is
&s;carce a County or Pari&s;h, in tho&s;e We&s;tern
Parts of <HI>Scotland,</HI> where &s;everal have not been
thus Condemn'd; nor was it eafy to prevent
the poor People being drawn into this Snare,
for when they were brought before the Coun|cil,
or the Court of Ju&s;ticiary, it was often ex|torted
from them by Threatnings of Death, and
&s;ometimes by Torture, and upon this &s;ingle
Que&s;tion, in their Courts of ju&s;tice (<HI>viz.</HI>} <HI>Whe|ther
the Ri&s;ing at</HI> Bothwell-<HI>Bridge was Rebellion,
and a Sin again&s;t God?</HI> I SAY, many, for re|fu&s;ing
to an&s;wer it, waving the Que&s;tion, and
declaring that they did not think them&s;elves
oblig'd to an&s;wer, were Condemn'd, and imme|diately
led away to Execution, <HI>for the Mercy
of tho&s;e Courts was &s;uch; that</HI> many were Sen|tenced
in the Morning, and Executed in the
Afternoon; nay, &s;ome were led immediately
from the Bar to the Gibbet, where they were
us'd again in the like cruel manner, being not
&s;uffer'd to declare their Innocence, or to &s;peak
to the People; but the Drums, being placed
round them, were kept beating all the Time
of their being upon the Scaffold and Ladder,
as has been mentioned already.</P>
<P>But to return to the Soldiers, to whom, as I
&s;aid before, the&s;e Cruelties not &s;ufficing, Ju&s;tice
was tran&s;po&s;ed. When we were talking of
the Severities of the Courts of Ju&s;tice, and the
<PB N="243" REF="342">
Cruelty of their Executioners, on Pretence of
Rebellion, it was &s;ufficient to call it Murther;
(for Inju&s;tice in Form of Law is the Devil re|presenting
an Angel of Light; and killing inno|cent
Men by Legal Proce&s;s is the wor&s;t &s;ort
of Murther:) But now we come from Murther
to Ma&s;&s;acre, for the Soldiers, being now ve&s;ted
with Judicial Authority, went up and down like
ravening Wolves, with Mouths open'd to &s;uck
the Blood of the Innocent: They &s;eem'd like
Men clothed with more Power than they un|der&s;tood,
tho' not more than they de&s;ir'd; that
had a Loo&s;e given to the Exce&s;s of what, by
their Occupation, they delighted in, I mean
Blood; had no Sen&s;e of ju&s;tice; they knew
how to kill, but not how to &s;ave; they knew
how to de&s;troy, but not how to &s;pare.</P>
<P>Their grand Enquiry was for <HI>Bothwell-Brigg|men,</HI>
as they call'd them: If they heard ca&s;ually
but the lea&s;t Report of a Man that he was a
<HI>Whig</HI> or a <HI>Cameronian</HI> (for &s;o they began now
to be call'd) their way of Proce&s;s was no more
than to enter his Hou&s;e, &s;eize upon his Per&s;on,
and, telling him he was a Rebel, drag him imme|diately
out to the Street, and &s;hoot him at a Po&s;t.</P>
<P>If the Soldiers &s;aw a Man in the Road who
&s;eem'd in the lea&s;t &s;hy of them, or that en|deavour'd
to &s;hun them,they immediately pur&s;u'd
him like Blood-hounds; and, if he fled, fired
upon him without any further Enquiry.</P>
<P>If; upon &s;earching any &s;trange Per&s;on, they
found a Bible about him, it was &s;ufficient
to charge him with having been at a Field-Meeting,
or that he was going to one; either of
which was &s;ufficient to &s;et them upon him like
Hounds upon a Hare, when they never ceas'd
pur&s;uing till they had brought him to Death.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="343">
If when any were dragging thus to Exe|cution,
a Stander-by &s;hould offer to intercede
for them, or look concern'd, &s;eem to pity them,
or lift up a Sigh for them, they would lay
Hands on them, and cry, &startq;What are you, Sir,
that you feem &s;o much troubled at this?
Wherefore do you pity them? Are they not
the King's Enemies?&endq; And they were all at
the Gallows, you &s;hould be glad, if you were
a Friend to the King. Come, can you an|&s;wer
the Que&s;tions? And thus they have
&s;ingled out hone&s;t Men among the Spectators,
by the meer Trouble which appear'd in their
Faces and Countenances for the Sufferings of
tho&s;e that have been thus cruelly handled.</P>
<P>And now, to confirm all the&s;e Things by
Examples undeniable, the few that are made
publick are indeed &s;ufficient to &s;ilence the
Tongues of any that pretend to deny the Fact;
but, alas! they are nothing, compar'd to the
Number of tho&s;e that many yet living can give
an Account of from their own Knowledge and
Memories.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the publick Accounts given by Name,
and of which Li&s;ts have been printed, we find
&s;everal In&s;tances of Cruelty not made publick,
e&s;pecially in this Ca&s;e of the Soldiers having
Power given to kill and &s;ave as they plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>A Lieutenant and three Soldiers pa&s;&s;ing by the
Road, &s;ound a Man &s;leeping on the Side of a
Bank, and a &s;mall Pocket-Bible lying by him;
whereupon one of the Soldiers waking him,
brings him to the Lieutenant. The Lieutenant
ask'd him who he was: He told him his Name,
Place of Abode, and whether he was travelling,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) going to <HI>Fife,</HI> being a Weaver by Trade.
They ask'd him then <HI>if he would pray for the
<PB N="245" REF="344">
King.</HI> He &s;aid, <HI>Yes, with all his Heart:</HI> Upon
which the Lieutenant was about to let him go;
but one of the Soldiers unhappily put in: <HI>But,
Sir, will you renounce the Covenant?</HI> The Man he|&s;itated
a little, but being urged and in&s;ulted,
cries out, <HI>Lord, forgive we, that I fear'd to own
thy Work;</HI> and then &s;peaking to the Lieutenant,
<HI>Indeed Sir,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I'll as &s;oon renounce my Bap|ti&s;m,</HI>
(or to that Purpo&s;e,) <HI>I know your Power,
work your Will with me;</HI> upon which they &s;hot
him upon the Spot.</P>
<P>A Party of Dragoons in <HI>Nith&s;dale</HI> had Infor|mation
that Six <HI>Bothwell-Brigg-men,</HI> as they
call'd them, were harbour'd in the Houfe of a
Country-man near hand; they immediately be|&s;et
the Hou&s;e, and, breaking in, they found
Four Men there and the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e;
and, without enquiring whether they were guilty
of the Ri&s;ing or not, brought them all out of
the Door, and &s;hot them dead, refu&s;ing to give
them a Minute's Time to pray to God, but
&s;wearing and bla&s;pheming when it was but beg'd
for by the Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The Writer of this has heard the late Lieu|tenant-General
<HI>Maitland</HI> expre&s;s great Abhor|rence
of the Cruelties committed by Major <HI>Bal|four,</HI>
Captain <HI>Dougla&s;s,</HI> General <HI>Dalziel,</HI> and &s;e|veral
others, who would take Pains to &s;earch
out &s;uch Men as they thought did but &s;hun to
be &s;een, and, with little or no Examination,
&s;hoot them upon the Spot; which he, being
then under Command, could no way prevent:
But many times, when Power was in his Hands,
he either facilitated their E&s;cape, or otherwi&s;e
prevented the Mi&s;chief intended.</P>
<P>In a Village not far from <HI>Hamilton,</HI> a poor
Trade&s;man was be&s;et in his Hou&s;e, while at
<PB N="246" REF="345">
his Work, by Five Soldiers, his Name <HI>Law&s;on:</HI>
They called to him to come down the Stairs,
which he refus'd to do; upon which all the
Five Soldiers fir'd at him, but he, being aware,
&s;tood by the Wall of the Chamber and avoided
the Shot, and then call'd to them and ask'd
them wherefore they came to him, he was no
<HI>Bothwell-Brigg-man.</HI> Well then, &s;ay the Soldiers,
<HI>come down, and we will do you no Hurt.</HI> The
Man, however, knowing they were not to be
tru&s;ted, came down, but got out of his Back
Door, and jumping over two or three low
Stone-Walls of the Gardens, got into the Fields,
and took him to Flight, being very &s;wift of
Foot, and knowing they had ju&s;t fir'd all their
Pieces: They pur&s;u'd him, and, loading their
Mu&s;quets as they run, fir'd at him again &s;everal
Shot; but, by good Providence mi&s;&s;ing him,
the Man e&s;eaped to the Hills, but was heard
of no more at his own Habitation.</P>
<P>The afore&s;aid Lieutenant-General <HI>Maitland</HI>
was then an Officer among the&s;e bloody Troops,
and was, with &s;ome Soldiers, quarter'd in Gla&s;|gow
but, being a Man of generous Principles,
and of too much Humanity to be guilty of
&s;uch Things as the&s;e, was a great Relief to the
per&s;ecuted People, for he &s;helter'd and pro|tected
many who otherwi&s;e had been murther'd
by the Soldiers; and if he was commanded on
the Service which he abhorr'd &s;o much, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
to fall upon the poor People in their Hou&s;e
or Field-Meetings, would frequently, by tru&s;ty
Me&s;&s;engers, give them private Notice, that they

<P>The Writer of the&s;e Memoirs, having talked
with many Sober and Judicious Per&s;ons, who li|ved
in that part of the Country at that time, and
were Eye Witne&s;&s;es to much, of it, found that

Men, be&s;ides tho&s;e killed in the Field of Battle
at <HI>Pentland</HI> Hills, <HI>Bothwell,</HI> &amp;c. And one Reve|rend

who dyed in Pri&s;ons and in Bani&s;hment; there
was an Account taken or above Eighteen Thou|&s;and
People, who&s;e Blood the&s;e Per&s;ecutors

Honour of the Cau&s;e, the&s;e People &s;uffered in,
and in ju&s;tification of the Principles which they
acted from, we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that their Number
was &s;o far from being dimini&s;hed, or them|&s;elves,
or their Mini&s;ters, from being di&s;coura|ged,
that on the contrary, they encrea&s;ed prodi|giou&s;ly
in Number, neither were their Meetings
ever de&s;titute of Mini&s;ters, nor were they ever
&s;o di&s;couraged as to give over Meeting for the

<PB N="255" REF="354">
God in &s;inglene&s;s of Heart, and with Joy
Embraced the Opportunities tho' at the hazard
of their Lives.</P>
<P>I cannot Expre&s;s this more fully than in the
Words of the Sufferers them&s;elves left upon Re|cord
by one of their own Fellows in Affliction,
thus, (<HI>viz.</HI>) &startq;To &s;peak of the Numbers, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI>
we mu&s;t do Ju&s;tice to the Miracle of God's
Working, whereby the very means u&s;ed to ex|tirpate
us from the Face of the Earth, was by
the Wi&s;e Di&s;po&s;er of all things, made to en|crea&s;e
our Numbers; for that albeit they went
on for many Years impri&s;oning, bani&s;hing, and
butchering our dear Brethren, yet all the Pri|&s;ons
they could fill with us, and all the Ships
they could freight with us, and all the Gibbets
they could hang us on, could never either ex|hau&s;t
or le&s;&s;en our Number, but the more we
were Afflicted, the more we grew, and the
de&s;ign to De&s;troy us, thro' the Mercy of our
God, prov'd always ruinous to the De&s;troyers;
and this mu&s;t be acknowledged to the Prai&s;e
of God's Clemency, and the Condemnation of
Man's Cruelty, that when they had Tryed all
ways po&s;&s;ible to de&s;troy us, and root us out
from the Earth; after they had hang'd, &s;hot,
tortur'd and bani&s;hed for Slaves, all they could
catch of us, they were further from their pur|po&s;e
than when they began: Our Numbers
were not dimini&s;hed, our Meeaings for Go&s;pel
Ordinances were not di&s;appointed, but we
enjoy'd the admini&s;trations in their Purity, and,
Power, with greater Certainty, and met toge|ther
in greater Numbers than ever, for than
our Numbers encrea&s;ed more and more:&endq; That
this was true, their Enemies openly acknow|ledg'd,
and this enraged the Per&s;ecutors &s;o much
<PB N="256" REF="355">
the more, and that to &s;uch a degree that they
once re&s;olv'd on a general Ma&s;&s;acre of all together
by the Troops of <HI>Heretors,</HI> Dragoons and High-land
Men, who, forming them&s;elves into a great
Army, &s;pread them&s;elves from one Side of a
whole County to the other, having their Men
placed, marching &s;ingle at a great Di&s;tance, but
always one in Sight of the other; &s;o marching
forward, every one &s;traight before him, they
by this Means &s;earched the Rocks, Rivers,
Woods, wa&s;ts, Mountains, Mo&s;&s;es, and every
the mo&s;t private and retired Places of the Coun|ty,
where they thought we were hidden; &s;o that
it was impo&s;&s;ible any thing could e&s;cape them:
And yet &s;o true were the Mountain-Men, <HI>as their
Per&s;ecutors call'd them,</HI> to one another, that in all
that famous March they found not one Man,
tho' many a good Man perhaps, with trembling
Heart and Hands lift up to Heaven for Pro|tection,
&s;aw them, and were pa&s;s'd by them un|di&s;cover'd.</P>
<P>Failing in any Enterprize of this Nature, and
being di&s;appointed in their Prey, always, re|doubled
their Fury at tho&s;e who fell into their
Hands: It was not far from <HI>Edinburgh</HI> that a
Field-Meeting was appointed, and not the Mi|ni&s;ter
only, but a great many People went out
of that City, at the Hazard of their Lives, to
have been pre&s;ent at it; when, on the Way,
they got Notice that the Appointment had been
di&s;covered, and that Soldiers were coming
to fall upon the People. The faithful
Spies, that gave them Intelligence of this, did
it &s;o timely and &s;o prudently, that the Sol|diers
found no-body a&s;&s;embled at the Place: But
their Rage doubling at the Di&s;appointment, they
fell upon every one they met in their Return,
<PB N="257" REF="356">
and chiefly upon the poor Women and Maid-Servants,
charging them with being actually
going to the Field-Meeting, tho not pre&s;ent at it:
Be&s;ides the Rudene&s;s and In&s;olence of another Na|trure
which they offer'd to the Women, as upon
all &s;uch Occa&s;ions was their Manner, they car|ry'd
about 30 Women to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and Four
or Five Men, where they were put in Pri&s;on,
&s;ome in the Tolbooth, &s;ome in the Correction-Hou&s;e,
tho' Per&s;ons of good Fa&s;hion and Fa|milies;
and of the&s;e 7 or 8 were at &s;everal
times put to death, principally upon their re|fu&s;ing
to renounce <HI>the Covenant,</HI> and to make
Declarations condemning their Principles; and on
acknowledging their being on the Way to a
their Meeting. One poor Servant-Maid, be|longing
to a Citizen's Wife of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> being
with her Mi&s;tre&s;s, and having her Mi&s;tre&s;s's
Bible under her Arm, was taken by the Soldiers,
her Mi&s;tre&s;s escaping by running into a Stable:
The poor Maid, being examin'd upon no other
Suspicion but having the Bible, boldly own'd
&s;he was going to the Field-Meeting, but refu&s;ed
to accu&s;e her Mi&s;tre&s;s, or any one el&s;e; where-upon
they threaten'd her with the Torture, to
make her confe&s;s. She an&s;wer'd, &s;he was ready
to endure Torture or Death, and talk'd to them
with &s;uch Pre&s;ence of Mind, &s;uch Strength of
Rea&s;oning, and &s;uch Chearfulne&s;s, as made them
both mad and a&s;ham'd: They &s;entenc'd her to
be hang'd in the Street of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and ano|ther
young Woman with her. She receiv'd the
Sentence with rejoycing, and lifting up her
Hands and Eyes, gave God Thanks, that had
thought her worthy to &s;uffer for her Testimony
to the Truth of Religion, and the Purity of his
Worihip.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="357">
The Cruelty of the Persecutors was farther
remarkable in the&s;e poor young Women's Suf|fering,

condemn'd for murthering their Ba&s;tard-Chil|dren,

they ea&s;ily di&s;cover'd the Difference by the Man|ner
of their Behaviour, while the&s;e two appear'd
with &s;miling Countenances, &s;inging P&s;alms, and
in a chearful inimitable Frame; the other de|jected,
confu&s;ed, and, to &s;ay all in a Word, like
what they really were.</P>
<P>It would be endle&s;s to give an Account of the
Manner of Execution, the Behaviour of the Suf|fering
People in their Impri&s;onment and at their
Execution, or the Cruelty of the Judges in Tor|turing
tho&s;e who were brought before them,
with that truly barbarous Engine for Torrture
unknown to all the World but to <HI>Scotland,</HI> call'd
the <HI>Boot;</HI> by which, the Leg being put in, and
the Wedges driven with a great Maul by the
Executioner, the Bone has been entirely com|pre&s;s'd,
and the Marrow of the Bone has been
&s;een to bur&s;t out thro' the macerated Fle&s;h.</P>
<P>Yet it was not found that any one of tho&s;e
who were thus tortur'd yielded to the Tor|mentors,
either to accu&s;e them&s;elves or betray
others. Mr. <HI>Hugh Mackail,</HI> a young Man of
about 24 Years of Age, and being what they
call a Probationer for the Office of a Mini&s;ter,
but not yet a Mini&s;ter ordain'd, was Licentiat,
and had preach'd &s;ome time before the turning
out of the Presbyterians at the Re&s;toration, he
is an eminent Example of this: His Ca&s;e, in
&s;hort, io as follows;</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="358">
Being a young Man of promising Parts and
great Elocution, he was appointed to preach in
the Great Church, at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> the Sabbath be|fore
the Turning out of the Mini&s;ters; and his
Subject, as might be expected, related to the
cruel Per&s;ecutions which the Church of God, in
all Ages, had undergone from the Enemies of
je&s;us Chri&s;t and his Kingdom; it was &s;ug|ge&s;ted
that he carry'd on a Parallel between
the Per&s;ecutions of the People of God in the
<HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Church, and tho&s;e of the People of God
in the Presbyterian Church ot <HI>Scotland:</HI> And it
was very particular and &s;urprizing to many that
heard him, when he told them the Church were
per&s;ecuted by a <HI>Pharaoh</HI> upon the Throne, a Ha|man
in the State, and a <HI>Judas</HI> in the Church;
by whom he was &s;uappos'd to mean King <HI>Charle's</HI>
the IId. then reigning upon the Throne; the Duke
of <HI>Landerdale,</HI> then principal Agent in <HI>Scots</HI> Af|fairs;
and the Archbi&s;hop of St. <HI>Adrew's,</HI> an
Apo&s;tate from the True Church, and then the
mo&s;t fal&s;e Betrayer, and at that time, the mo&s;t
implacable Per&s;ecutor of that very Church which
he had before been a Member and Mini&s;ter of.</P>
<P>It &s;eems the Archbi&s;hop, who was &s;eldom
known to forgive any one, had not forgotten, this
tho' it was in the Year 1661, four Years be|fore;
And it was not many Days after his
preaching, that Sermon, that a Party of Soldiers
was &s;ent to &s;eize him; but he got notice of
their De&s;ign, and convey'd him&s;elf away into the
We&s;t, where he continued retir'd till the Affair
of <HI>Penthland,</HI> of which Mention has been made,
when being oblig'd, as he thought, to join with
his Brethren in renewing the Covenant, he went
to <HI>Lanerk,</HI> where that &s;olemn renewing the Co|venant
was perform'd, as has been ob&s;erv'd
<PB N="260" REF="359">
Page .... When they were defeated at
<HI>Pentland,</HI> it happen'd this young Man was taken
and brought in Pri&s;oner to <HI>Edinburgh.</HI> The
Archbi&s;hop remember'd the Sermon and the
Man, and had his full Revenge upon this Oc|ca&s;ion,
as the Event &s;hew'd: Mr. <HI>Mackail</HI> was
not taken in the Action, neither was he in it,
nor was he taken in the Company of any that
were in the Action; but meerly, and unpolitick|ly
enough, as travelling on the Road; for the
Weakne&s;s of his Con&s;titution having render'd
him unable to bear the Fatigues of marching,
or the Rigour of the Sea&s;on, he was oblig'd to
leave the Body of Men who march'd after to
<HI>Pentland</HI>-Hills being no longer able to endure
it; &s;o parting from them at a Place call'd
<HI>Cramond-Bridge,</HI> he was taken by &s;ome Country|men
who were &s;ent out to &s;top the Pa&s;&s;ages, to
prevent the E&s;cape of the Rebels, as they were
then call'd.</P>
<P>Being taken and brought to Council, he was
committed to the <HI>$Tolbooth,</HI> and &s;everal times
examin'd, and at length tortur'd to make him
con&s;els him&s;elf guilty, wrhich however they
could not make him do; the Archbi&s;hop of
St. <HI>Andrews</HI> being pre&s;ent all the Time of his
Torture, as one of the Judges, appointing and
directing the &s;ame: A terrible Work indeed it
was for a Chri&s;tian Bi&s;hop! but very agreeable
to the re&s;t of his Character, if we may believe
what was generally &s;aid of him at that Time a|mong
even indifferent Men.</P>
<P>They que&s;tion'd him likewi&s;e, <HI>upon Torture,</HI>
to declare what was the original Cau&s;e and
De&s;ign of that Infurrection. He an&s;wer'd, he
knew not any more of it, than <HI>that it was oc|ca&s;ion'd
by the Cruelty of Sir</HI> James Turner, <HI>who
<PB N="261" REF="360">
having been re&s;i&s;ted by &s;ome People who could no longer
bear his Violence; that Re&s;i&s;tance having exposed
them to the Revenge of the Soldiers, and the Appre|hen&s;ions
of that Revenge having made them de&s;perate,
that very Accident drove them to take Arms,</HI> as
has been ob&s;erv'd before in the Accounts given
of that Action.</P>
<P>They were not &s;atisfy'd with, this an&s;wer,
but pre&s;s'd him to declare all he knew of that
Affair; and, upon his declaring he knew <HI>no
more,</HI> they order'd him to be tortured: At every
Blow the Tormentors &s;truck, they ask'd if he
would confe&s;s; and upon receiving &s;till the
&s;ame an&s;wer (<HI>viz.) That he knew no more than he
had told them,</HI> they renewed the Torture till he
had received Eleven Strokes of the Hang-man.</P>
<P>It &s;eems they had been heated the &s;ame Morn|ing,
and their Fury encreas'd, by having ju&s;t
before torturM another Gentlemen (<HI>viz.</HI>) Mr. <HI>Ni|chol&s;on
of Cor&s;ack,</HI> in a mo&s;t terrible manner.</P>
<P>Here, for the Information of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Rea|der,
or other Stranger to the Cu&s;toms and Ju|dicatories
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> it is nece&s;&s;ary to note,
that this Examination by Torture is always done
in the Pre&s;ence ot the Judges, who order the
Tormentors when to begin, how long to pro|ceed,
and when to &s;top, and interrogate the
Sufferer all the time, and in the Interval of their
Blows.</P>
<P>&startq;Mr. <HI>Mackail, &s;ays an Author who relates that
Story,</HI> having before declar'd ingenuou&s;ly all
he knew, could not be mov'd by the Torture
to expre&s;s any Impatience or Bitterne&s;s, tho'
the Torture was in it &s;elf very violent and
terrible, by rea&s;on of the Compre&s;&s;ure of the
Fle&s;h, Sinews, and even the Bones, by the
Force of woodden Wedges driven in with a
<PB N="262" REF="361">
Hammer in a double and unu&s;ual Measure
even to 10 or 11 Strokes, with con&s;iderable
Intervals; all which he &s;u&s;tain'd mo&s;t con|&s;tantly
and chri&s;tianly: But before he received
the la&s;t three Strokes, he prote&s;ted &s;olemnly
in the Sight of God, That he could &s;ay no
more, tho' all the Joints of his Body were in
as great Torture as that poor Leg; and de|&s;ires
to know what could hinder them to be|lieve
one of his Profe&s;&s;ion, who had &s;o &s;o|lemnly
declared, as in the Sight of God, that
he knew no more than he had told, <HI>viz.</HI>
That, to the be&s;t of his Knowledge, the Ri|&s;ing
in the We&s;t was meerly occa&s;ional, upon
Discontent between the People in the <HI>Stewartry</HI>
of <HI>Galloway</HI> and Sir <HI>James Turner,</HI> to which
every one did run as their Hearts mov'd
them, when they heard of it.&endq;</P>
<P>The Violence of this Torment, threw him
into a Fever, and yet could not the&s;e merciful
Judges be prevail'd with to re&s;pite his Appearing
before them above one Day, tho' two Phy&s;icians
and a Surgeon certify'd his dangerous Condition,
and he petition'd for a Delay on that Account:
Accordingly the next Day he was rather dragg'd
or carry'd than went to their Bar, and was con|demn'd
to die; on the third Day after which
was executed, accordingly.</P>
<P>There is another of the&s;e Sufferers who can|not
be forgot when we are Recording the Zeal
of the Church of <HI>Scotland's</HI> Martyrs, who, in
Imitation of the Primitive Zeal of the firft Cen|turies,
offer'd him&s;elf to the Sacrifice, without
any one laying Hand on him. This was <HI>James
Nicol of Peeble.</HI></P>
<P>He was occa&s;ionally at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> when three
of the We&s;tern People were to be brought to
<PB N="263" REF="362">
their A&s;&s;ize or their Trial, for refu&s;ing to an|&s;wer
the wicked en&s;haring Questions &s;o often
mention'd in the&s;e Memoirs. He went to the
Ju&s;ticiary Court to &s;ee them Try'd: It grieved
his Soul to &s;ee three innocent Men deliver'd, as
meek Lambs, into the Hands of the Butchers,
to be &s;laughter'd: It mov'd his Pa&s;&s;ion to &s;ee the
Tyrannical Behaviour of the cruel judges and
Per&s;ecutors, in&s;ulting and reviling the Sufferers;
and much ado he had, as he expre&s;s'd him&s;elf,
to re&s;train his Anger from breaking out upon
the Spot, and from reproaching them with &s;hed|ding
innocent Blood; but was in part &s;atisfy'd
and appeas'd, when he heard the three Sufferers,
who were his dear Friends and Brethren in the
Cau&s;e of God, an&s;wer with &s;uch Chearfulne&s;s
and Courage as put their Enemies to Shame.</P>
<P>He went from the Court however grieved in
his Spirit, having &s;een them Condemn'd, and
heard the bloody Sentence pronounc'd; and
that, it being then about 11 o'th' Clock, they
were order'd to be carry'd not back to Pri&s;on,
but from the Court where they received their
Sentence, to the Place of Execution.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Nicol,</HI> not intending to &s;ee the &s;ad Sight,
order'd his Hor&s;e to be brought out about One
o'th' Clock, to return to his own Hou&s;e, but was
oblig'd to &s;top at the We&s;t Port of the City to
have his Saddle mended; while he was &s;taying
there, he &s;aw the People running, and, asking
what it was for, was told the three hone&s;t Men
were bringing to the Place of Execution, and
looking up the Street &s;aw them a&s;cend the
Scaffold, which was in View of the Place where
he &s;tood: This moved him to walk up the
Gra&s;s Market to &s;ee them die Now he was
no longer able to contain, being moved with a
<PB N="264" REF="363">
&s;trong Zeal again&s;t the&s;e Murtherers: But he
crys out in the mid&s;t of the throng; <HI>they had mur|ther'd
Three of God's Servants, contrary to their own
Laws, and in a mo&s;t Barbarous and Inhumane manner.</HI>
Hereupon he was immediately apprehended,
this was on the 10th of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1684, on the 18th
he was examined before the Council, where they
were a&s;toni&s;hed to find that he, again&s;t whom
they had no Accu&s;ation, was bold to declare
him&s;elf in the mo&s;t dangerous Que&s;tions, and
rather &s;ought the Martyrdom he expected, than
that he would endeavour to avoid what they had
to Inflict, as the Reader will &s;ee by the manner
of their Interrogating him, and his An&s;wers
penn'd by him&s;elf as follows.</P>
<P><HI>FIRST,</HI> I was Interrogate by two in a Room
privately thus. Que&s;tion, Was you at <HI>Both|wel
Bridge? A.</HI> I am not bound to be my own
Accu&s;er; I am not (&s;aid one of them) to de&s;ire
you, but only &s;ay upon your Hone&s;t Word, that
you were not there. <HI>A.</HI> I am not bound to &s;a|tisfy
you, but Prove what you have to &s;ay again&s;t
me, and e&s;pecially you, till I come before my
Accu&s;ers. Well, &s;aid he, I am one of them.
Then I An&s;wered, I was there. <HI>Q.</HI> How came
you to ri&s;e in Arms again&s;t the King? <HI>A.</HI> Becau&s;e
he has broken the Covenant of the Lord my
God. <HI>Q.</HI> Was the Prelate's Death Murther? <HI>A.</HI>
No, it was not Murther. <HI>Q.</HI> Was <HI>Hack&s;toun's</HI>
Death Murther? <HI>A.</HI> That it was indeed. <HI>Q.</HI>
How dare you own the Covenant, &s;eeing the King
gave Orders to burn it by the Hand of the
Hangman! <HI>A.</HI> Yes, I dare own, for altho' ye
&s;hould e&s;cape the hand of Men for &s;o doing, yet
ye &s;hall all pay for it, e're all be done, and that
<PB N="265" REF="364">
to purpo&s;e: As for me I would not do it for the
whole Earth. Then I was Interrogate by other
two, who asked &s;ome frivolous Que&s;tions which
I baffled to &s;ilence. Then I was brought in be|fore
the Bloody Crew. What now, Sir, &s;aid
they, do ye own the King's Authority? <HI>A.</HI> I
own all things that the Precious Word of God
owns in le&s;s or more, and all Faithful Magi&s;trates.
<HI>Q.</HI> But do you not own King <HI>Charles
al&s;o! A.</HI> I dare not for a World, becau&s;e it is
Perjury, for he has unking'd him&s;elf in a high
degree, <HI>and that</HI> in doing all things contrary to
the Word of God and Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith, and
Catechi&s;ms Larger and Shorter. <HI>Q.</HI> Know ye to
whom ye are Speaking? <HI>A.</HI> I know I am before
Men. But (&s;aid one of them) ye are &s;peaking
to the <HI>Chancellor</HI> and <HI>Members of Council,</HI> Sir, But,
&s;aid I; AS I have told you already that he has
unking'd him&s;elf, SO have you degraded your
&s;elves from being Princes. <HI>Q.</HI> If the King were
here what would you &s;ay, Sir? <HI>A.</HI> I know how
I ought to &s;peak to the King, if he were King,
<HI>Sir,</HI> is ordinarily &s;aid to him; and &s;o to let you know
that I am no Quaker, or Erroneous in any thing,
but a pure <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> and of a Go&s;pel, Apo&s;to|lick
Spirit, I call you <HI>Sirs,</HI> becau&s;e ye are Noble|men
by Birth, but not becau&s;e ye are my Judges.
<HI>Q.</HI> Will ye not &s;ay God ble&s;s the King's Maje&s;ty!
<HI>A.</HI> I dare not ble&s;s them whom God hath reje|cted;
&startq;If any Man bring another Doctrine then
ye have received bid him not, God &s;peed, nor
receive him into your Hou&s;e <HI>2 John</HI> 10. And
<HI>P&s;alms</HI> 16. ver&s;e 4th &s;ays <HI>David,</HI> Their Drink
Offerings of Blood will I not Offer, nor take
up their names into my Lips, <HI>viz.&endq;</HI> Them
that ha&s;ten after other Gods, and therefore I dare
not Pray for him. <HI>Q.</HI> And will ye not Pray for
<PB N="266" REF="365">
him? <HI>A.</HI> If he belongs to the Election of Grace,
he has a part of my Prayers; and al&s;o if he were
a King that had keeped Covenant with God I
would giye him a double &s;hare, and make menti|on
of his Name; but he is an Apo&s;tate, (So,
my Friends, they looked &s;till one to another at
every Que&s;tion and An&s;wer) <HI>Q.</HI> How Old are
you Sir, <HI>A.</HI> I am 51 Years. <HI>Q.</HI> How dare you
own the Covenants &s;eeing we have burnt it by
the hand of the Hangman. <HI>A.</HI> Sir, I dare own
them upon all Perrils what&s;omever to the utmo&s;t
of my Power, all the Days of my Life. And with
that they Smiled and Laughed one to ano|ther
and to me; and &s;aid my Days were near an
end; I &s;aid I am now in your Power, but if ye
take my Blood, ye &s;hall take Innocent Blood
upon your &s;elves, as in <HI>Jer.</HI> 26. As for me, I am
in your Hands do to me as &s;eems good and meet unto you,
but know for a certainty that if ye put me to Death ye
&s;hall bring Innocent Blood upon your &s;elves and on this
City, and <HI>the Inhabitants thereof.</HI> And as for me,
if ye take my Blood, it's as Innocent Blood as
ever ye did take; for I did never wrong any
Man to this Day.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Do you go to the Church? <HI>A.</HI> I went ay
to the Church, where I could get any faithful Mi|ni&s;ter
to go to; but for your Prelates Kirks, and
<HI>Baal's Prie&s;ts,</HI> I never heard any of them, nor
never intends to do, if I were to live an hun|dred
Years: But (&s;aid they) Ye &s;hall not live
long now Sir.</P>
<P>Then on <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> they called me before them,
again, being the 19th Day of this In&s;tant. <HI>Q.</HI>
What &s;ay ye the Day, do you adhere to all ye
&s;aid Ye&s;terday? <HI>A.</HI> I adhere to all and hail
upon all Perrils what&s;omever. <HI>Q.</HI> Do ye approve
of <HI>Bothwell Bridge? A.</HI> Yes I do. <HI>Q.</HI> Do you
<PB N="267" REF="366">
go to the Kirk at <HI>Peebles? A.</HI> No, nor never in|tends
to go there, nor no Place el&s;e, which per|tains
to the perjured Prelates. <HI>Q.</HI> Do you own
the Covenants? <HI>A.</HI> I adhere to every <HI>Point</HI> of
them. <HI>Q.</HI> Do ye own <HI>Airs-Mo&s;s, Sanquhair, Ru|therglen
and Lanerk Declarations? A.</HI> Yes, I do;
becau&s;e they are agreeable to the Covenants, and
Work of Reformation. Many more Que|&s;tions
they asked, which I cannot now particu|larly
remember, but I told them in general, That
I was again&s;t <HI>Popery, Prelacy, Malignacy</HI> and <HI>Pro|phanity,</HI>
and all that is again&s;t &s;ound Doctrine,
Di&s;cipline, Wor&s;hip and Government; and all
Errors what&s;omever, which are contrary to &s;ound
<HI>Presbyterian</HI> Doctrine, be what they will; for
there is none other right, but erroneous; how
fair a Face &s;oever they have, which &s;hall be found
not agreeable to the Apo&s;tles Doctrine. And
then they read &s;ome thing of what I had &s;aid, and
que&s;tioned if I would &s;ub&s;cribe what I had &s;aid.
I an&s;wered, No, <HI>Q.</HI> Can ye write! <HI>A.</HI> Yes, I
can write? Then do it, &s;aid they: I &s;aid,
I would not do it at all, Now, my Friends, I
&s;ay the&s;e are but part of my Interrogations.</P>
<P>Again I was brought before the Ju&s;ticiary (as
they call them&s;elves) on the 20th of this In&s;tant,
and interrogate thus: <HI>Q.</HI> What now, Sir, what
think you of your &s;elf the Day? <HI>A.</HI> I prai&s;e my
GOD, I am the &s;ame I was. <HI>Q.</HI> What think ye
of what ye &s;aid Ye&s;terday before the <HI>Chancellor</HI>
and the <HI>Council? A.</HI> I hold all, and decline no|thing;
no not one Ace. <HI>Q.</HI> Were ye at <HI>Bothwel
Bridge? A.</HI> Yes, that I was. <HI>Q.</HI> Had ye Arms?
<HI>A.</HI> Yes that I had. One of them &s;aid, <HI>GOD
help you:</HI> And I &s;aid, I wote none of ye can pray
for your &s;elf: &s;aid he, I wi&s;h you better nor
<PB N="268" REF="367">
ye do your &s;elf: But I &s;aid, No: for ye would
have me di&s;own my great LORD, the King of
<HI>Zion,</HI> and obey Man; yea, ba&s;e Men; <HI>who&s;e Breath
is in their No&s;triles,</HI> who give out Laws and Com|mands
contrary to his. <HI>Q.</HI> How dare ye ri&s;e in
Arms again&s;t the King? <HI>A. It is better to
obey GOD than Man,</HI> and he is an Enemy to GOD.
<HI>Q.</HI> Would ye ri&s;e yet in Arms for the Covenants
again&s;t the King's Laws, if ye had the Occa&s;ion?
<HI>A.</HI> Yes, that I would, &s;ay the contrary who will,
upon all Peril. <HI>Q.</HI> What think ye of your &s;elf
in &s;poiling the Country of Hor&s;e and Arms, Sir?
<HI>A.</HI> Sir, I had not the worth of a Spur Whang of
any Man's, but was mounted of Hor&s;e and Arms
of my own. <HI>Q.</HI> Where have ye been all this
Time? <HI>A.</HI> Sometimes here and there, in <HI>En|land</HI>
and <HI>Scotland. Q.</HI> Whom have ye conver|&s;ed
with? <HI>A.</HI> I was about my Bu&s;ine&s;s, being a
Merchant. They &s;aid ye have been about ano|ther
Bu&s;ine&s;s; for ye are found to be a <HI>Fugitive</HI>
and <HI>a Vagabond. A.</HI> I have been a Merchant from
my Youth. <HI>Q.</HI> But where had ye your Chamber
in this Town? <HI>A.</HI> I had none the&s;e &s;everal Years.
<HI>Q.</HI> Where quarter ye in this Town? <HI>A.</HI> I have
not been much in it the&s;e 7 or 8 Years: <HI>Q.</HI> But
where was ye the Night, and the la&s;t Night be|fore
the Execution? <HI>A.</HI> I was not in Town, I
came but in to Port ju&s;t when the fir&s;t was
ca&s;t over. Then they looked one to another,
and whi&s;pered together; But they would
fain have had me wronging my Landlords in all
the Parts of the Country, and in all Burghs;
but Glory to my LORD, I have wronged none
yet, nor yet hopes to do; for it was ay my Care,
and Prayer to GOD earne&s;tly, that I might wrong
no Man, and that I had rather &s;uffer before any
were wronged by me, which he has keeped me
<PB N="269" REF="368">
from to this Day: Then they read what I had
said. <HI>Q.</HI> Will ye &s;ub&s;cribe what ye have &s;aid.
<HI>A.</HI> No, no. <HI>Q.</HI> Can ye write, Sir? <HI>A</HI> Yes,
that I can. Well, &s;aid they, write down, That
he can, but will not. They told me five or &s;ix
Times, that my Time &s;hould not be long, and
&s;aid to me, Will ye have a Mini&s;ter? <HI>A.</HI> I will
have none of your <HI>Baal's Priests.</HI></P>
<P>After the&s;e Interrogations, and that they had
left him for Two or Three Days, on the 22th on$
brought him the Copy of his Indictment, telling
him at the &s;ame Time, that on the 27th he
would receive his Sentence, and that he would be
carryed directly from the Bar to the Scaffold,

call it a per&s;uit of Murtherers, but <HI>the Fact was
thus;</HI> the Number of the Per&s;ons pro&s;crib'd was
prodigiou&s;ly Great, who flying into Dens, and
Holes and Caves of the Earth, lay concealed in
the Hills and Mountains, from whence by the
vigilance of their Enemies, they were frequently
dragg'd out to Execution and Death, either with
or without Proce&s;s, as has been &s;aid. Sometimes as
Occa&s;ion offered, the&s;e di&s;tre&s;s'd People would
get together either for their Field Meetings, or
to &s;hift from Place to Place, as Occa&s;ion offer'd
for their Relief, and that they might not be a
prey to every &s;ingle Soldier or Laird, that
&s;hould meet them Naked and Unarm'd, they
carry'd Arms for their Defence; &s;o long only as
they were together, &s;eparating again as they had
Occa&s;ion, and then laying by their Weapons.</P>

The Dragoons who came upon them were about
120 Men, being 3 Troops; the per&s;ecuted People
were about 40 Foot indifferently Arm'd, and 26

he formerly had a declar'd Quarrel again&s;t him
Per&s;onally, and would not &s;uffer it to be &s;aid that

he &s;eparated from them, and refu&s;ed to be con|cern'd

<P>Being forced thus to Fight as above, with &s;o

having &s;hewed all the Marks of Bravery and Gallan|try
po&s;&s;ible, being &s;urrounded by Numbers and o|ver

Wounded: Mr. <HI>Hack&s;ton &s;eeing</HI> his Men broken,

fought like a Lyon, and with a de&s;perate Courage
made his way quite thro' the Enemy, Kil|ling

any con&s;iderable Wound, he made off, but
was clo&s;ely pur&s;ued by 4 Dragoons; the good|ne&s;s
of his Hor&s;e carryed him from them, and
he was in a fair way to have e&s;cap'd, when his
Hor&s;e plung'd into a Bog, from whence he could
not get him out: Being thus un-hor&s;t a Dragoon
came up to him who knew him, and offered him
Quarter, which he refu&s;ed, and fought him with
his Sword, and would have Ma&s;ter'd him, but
Three other Dragoons &s;urrounding him, they
knock't him down, giving him &s;everal Wounds
in the Head, and &s;o took him Pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Cameron</HI> fighting as boldly at the Head of
the other part of the Hor&s;e, was Killed, and his
Head cut off, and carryed with the Pri&s;oners to
<HI>Edinburgh.</HI> The Foot being rid down by the
Dragoons and Di&s;per&s;ed, fled to the Hills, a|bout
17 of them were kiled or taken, and the

him that they had &s;omething to &s;ay to him, and
commanded him to fit down and receive his Sen|tence,

and declare again&s;t, as Enemies to God and their

they Oppo&s;ed, and thought them&s;elves bound in
Con&s;cience to do &s;o, as being di&s;charg'd from all
<HI>Civil</HI> Allegiance to them, by the Breach of their
Coronation Engagements; and of all <HI>Religious</HI> En|gagements
to them, by the breaking their &s;olemn
Oath to God and his Church; and turning Per&s;|cutors
of that very Church they had Sworn to
maintain; and this they did on the &s;ame Arguments
which ju&s;tify'd the Revolution, and on which
the <HI>Protestant</HI> Succe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Hannover</HI> is now foun|ded;
<HI>to wit,</HI> of taking Arms again&s;t perjur'd Prin|ces,
who break their &s;olemn Compact with God
and their People; Renouncing and Depo&s;ing
them, and excluding both them and their Race;
and ble&s;&s;ed be God who has given &s;uch a Te&s;ti|mony
in our Days, to the Memory of his Saints,
and to the truth of the Doctrine and Principles,
which the&s;e faithful Martyrs in <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;uffered
for, by bringing the whole Nation, nay even
&s;ome of the very Per&s;ecutors them&s;elves, to take
up tho&s;e very Principles, with re&s;pect to Govern|ment
and Obedience, that tho&s;e &s;uffering Chri&s;ti|ans
Dy'd for; and to Expel and Depo&s;e, reject and

<PB N="275" REF="374">
Oaths, and injurious to the People, which the&s;e
good People were Per&s;ecuted and Murthered for
rejecting before. And therefore even the De|claration
at <HI>Torwood</HI> as it was call'd, where they
Excommunicated the King, and which the Ene|mies
of the&s;e good People pretented, to be En|thu&s;ia&s;tick,
Develli&s;h, Rebellious and Antichri|&s;tian,
and for which &s;aid good People were Cen|&s;ur'd,
even by their Brethren who acce pted of
the Indulgences. I &s;ay, that very Excommuni|cation
is expre&s;ly founded upon the &s;ame Grounds,
as was afterwards the renouncing the King by
the Revolution, with this Difference only, that
the Rea&s;ons given by Mr. <HI>Cargil,</HI> Mr. <HI>Cameron</HI>
and the People then call'd <HI>Cameronians</HI> in the De|claration
of the <HI>Queens-Ferry,</HI> and the Excom|munication

from the People of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> to invite him to
a&s;&s;i&s;t them in Arms again&s;t the &s;ame King, and
much more.</P>
<P>To make this clear, I here give you that fa|mous
Excommunication, pronounced by Mr.
<HI>Donald Cargil</HI> at <HI>Torwood, Anno</HI> 1684 and only
de&s;ire the impartial Reader, to compare it with
the Memorials abovenam'd, and &s;ee if it be po&s;|&s;ible
for any <HI>Briti&s;h Prote&s;tant,</HI> who owns the Ju|&s;tice
of the Revolution, to reflect upon the Zeal
of the&s;e People, without blu&s;hing for him&s;elf,
and the whole Nation, that they did not &s;ee and
abhor the Tyranny of tho&s;e Reigns &s;ooner: Then
they had joy$'d with the&s;e People, in&s;tead of cen&s;u|ring
their Zeal: The Revolution had then been
brought about, without Foreign help at all; the
Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> had then been call'd over as
peaceably as King <HI>George,</HI> to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
the Crown, and the Blood of near Twenty Thou|&s;and
<PB N="276" REF="375">
People, who were one way or other Murther'd
or De&s;troy'd, by that now abdicated race of Ty|rants,
and their bloody Admini&s;tration had been
&s;aved.</P>
<P>What a &s;hame it is to us, and how much to the
Honour of the&s;e per&s;ecuted People, that THEY
could thus &s;ee the Treachery and Tyranny of
tho&s;e Reigns, when we &s;aw it not; or rather that
they had &s;o much Hone&s;ty of Principle, and o|bey'd
&s;o &s;trictly the Dictates of Con&s;cience, as to
bear their Te&s;timony Early, Nobly, and Glori|ou&s;ly,
to the truth of God, and the rights of
their Country, both Civil and Religious, while
we all, tho' &s;eeing the &s;ame Things, and equal|ly
convinc'd of its being Right, yet betray'd the
cau&s;e of Liberty and Religion, by a &s;inful Silence,
and a dreadful Cowardice; not joyning to
help the Lord, or the People of the Lord, a|gain&s;t
the Mighty, &s;itting &s;till and &s;eeing our
Brethren Slaughter'd and Butchered, in Defence
of their Principles, which our Con&s;ciences told
us, <HI>even then,</HI> were founded on the Truth, and
by tho&s;e Tyrants, who we knew de&s;erv'd to be
rejected both of God and the Nation, and who
afterwards we did reject accordingly: <HI>But to Pro|ceed.</HI></P>
<P>As tho&s;e Suffering People are abundantly ju|&s;tifyed
by the Practice of the whole Nation, in
the Revolution, &s;o I mu&s;t add, that they are a|bundantly
acquitted of that weak and unju&s;t
Charge, mentioned before, <HI>viz.</HI> of their being Ene|mies
to Government, and refu&s;ing to &s;ubmit to
Lawful Authority, by their behaviour in the Re|volution;

<P>After he had pronounc'd the above Sentences

following. &startq;I think, &s;aid he, none that acknow|ledge
the Word of God, the Power deputed
to his Church, and the Rea&s;on and Nature
of that Power, can judge this Sentence to be
unju&s;t. The Pretence of its being unformal,
without Warnings, Admonitions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is fully
an&s;wer'd, in that tho&s;e Men have placed them|&s;elves
above the Admonitions of Mini&s;ters,

put to cruel Deaths the Servants and Mini&s;ters
of Chri&s;t, who have with Freedom and Boldne&s;s
adventur'd to give them Warnings and Ad|monitions,
and &s;hut up all Acce&s;s from us

of the Fact, I have here charg'd upon them

it needeth not, the Deeds being notour and
known, and the mo&s;t of them &s;uch as them|&s;elves
do avow, and, to their Shame, boa&s;t of.
And <HI>as the Cau&s;es are ju&s;t,</HI> and &s;uch as for which
the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t have in all Ages pro|ceeded
to the like Sentence, SO it being now
done by a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel, and in &s;uch
a Manner as the pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances of the
Church of Chri&s;t, with re&s;pect to the pre&s;ent
cruel Per&s;ecution, will admit, the Sentence
likewi&s;e is undoubtedly ju&s;t al&s;o; and there
are no Powers on Earth, either of Kings,
Princes, Magi&s;trates, or Mini&s;ters of the
Go&s;pel, can, without the Repentance of the
Per&s;ons openly and legally appearing, rever&s;e
the&s;e Sentences upon any <HI>&s;uch</HI> Account: And
as God, who is the Author of that Power, is
the more engaged to the ratifying the&s;e Sen|tences,
&s;o all that acknowledge the Word of
God, and believe them&s;elves &s;ubject to his
Government, ought al&s;o to acknowledge them.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If any &s;hall object, as we hear they do, that
the&s;e Proceedings, tho' not unju&s;t, are fooli&s;h
and rigorous: We an&s;wer with that Word of
Scripture which we have much more rea&s;on
to u&s;e than tho&s;e of whom it is recorded,
<HI>Gen. 34. 31. Should he deal with our Si&s;ter as with an
Harlot?</HI> Should they deal with our God as
with an Idol; Should they deal with his Peo|ple
as with Murtherers and Malefactors; and
&s;hall we not draw out God's Sword again&s;t
God's Enemies.&endq;</P>
<P>It is true that this Action was the Execration
and Aver&s;ion of tho&s;e Times, and of the Sove|reign
that then Reigned, and to their Reproach
it will be Recorded, that two &s;orts of People

&startq;In the Year 1664 he had a Child born, and

or Epi&s;copal Par&s;on, he had it privately
Bapti&s;ed by one of the outed Mini&s;ters. The

enrag'd at this, publi&s;h'd in his Pulpit, that
he would Excommunicate Mr. <HI>Nisbet</HI> the next
Lord's day, and had done &s;o, but that the Day
before he was &s;natch'd away by Death &s;uddenly.
When the Per&s;ecuted People in 1666, met to|gether
at <HI>Lanerk,</HI> and received the Covenant at
<HI>Lanerk,</HI> his Con&s;cience &s;ummon'd him to join
with them; and being known, and threatn'd with
Death for that Action, was oblig'd for his own
&s;afety to follow tho&s;e People, and keep with
them in Arms: At the Fight at <HI>Pentland</HI> he was
&s;ore wounded, &s;tript as Dead, and left among the
Slain, but was pre&s;erv'd, and made his e&s;cape.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;At the In&s;urrection at <HI>Bothwell,</HI> he joyn'd with
the &s;ame People again, and fought openly and
<HI>Boldly</HI> at the <HI>Bridge;</HI> being not only a zealous
Chri&s;tian, but a Man of great Bravery and Re|&s;olution,
as long as any Man would &s;tand;

him, his E&s;tate and Goods &s;eiz'd,

turn'd out of Doors.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;In this Condition he was one of tho&s;e who are

in De&s;arts and in Mountains, and in Dens and

their Mini&s;ters and Bretheren from Vio|lence
during the Wor&s;hip of God, as occa&s;ion

Weather, it plea&s;ed God that they were &s;een,

received Seven Wounds, they were all taken.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The Lieutenant of Dragoons, who was of his

to him, asked him <HI>what he thought of him&s;elf
now?</HI> He Reply'd, <HI>I think as well of Chri&s;t and

Suffer; and I only Grieve that I am left, and my
dear Brethren are gone to Heaven, whom you have
wickedly Murther'd.</HI> The Bloody Cruel Wretch
Reply'd with an Oath, <HI>he &s;hould not be long behind

He An&s;wered, <HI>If the Lord &s;tand by me, and keep
me faithful to Death, I care not what Sufferings I
am put to endure.</HI> The Lieutenant then bound
him Cruelly, tho' bleeding at his Wounds, and
carried him to <HI>Kilmarnock,</HI> and from thence
to <HI>Air,</HI> where by Interce&s;&s;ion of Friends, a Sur|geon
was allow'd to dre&s;s his Wounds, after

<P>&startq;Being brought to <HI>Edinburgh</HI> he was brought be|fore
the Bloody Council, where they ask'd him
the Que&s;tions following, and received &s;hort An|&s;wers
from him, &s;uch as barely &s;hew'd, that he
neither expected or &s;ought any Mercy at their

pretended he would do it for them, and made a
long Speech of what was done (tho' he gave a

<P>Upon the&s;e an&s;wers and without any farther
proce&s;s, they pa&s;&s;ed Sentence of Death upon him,

not only with Chri&s;tain Submi&s;&s;ion, but with
thankfullne&s;s, ble&s;&s;ing, and prai&s;ing God, who
had counted him worthy to &s;uffer for his Name:
during the time of his Impri&s;onment he was
u&s;ed very cruelly, having a mercile&s;s Weight of
Irons upon him during the whole time; yet he de|clar'd
that he had a con&s;tant wonderful inward
A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Support from the Good Spirit of
God, bearing him up under the Cro&s;s, having
both a comfortable A&s;&s;urance of the Pardon of his
Sins, and a full Satisfaction of the Ju&s;tne&s;s of the
Cau&s;e in which he &s;uffered.</P>
<P>After this we need but conclude this Work
with an Account of the la&s;t Martyr who &s;uffered
in this Cau&s;e, and this was a Godly Mini&s;ter; to
leave it upon Record, that as the fir&s;t that dyed
was a Mini&s;ter (<HI>viz.</HI>) Mr. <HI>James Guthrie.</HI> So was
the la&s;t al&s;o (<HI>viz.</HI>) Mr. <HI>James Renwick.</HI></P>
<P>There is another Ob&s;ervation on the Occa&s;ion
of his Death (<HI>viz.</HI>) that he dyed the 17th of <HI>Feb.</HI>
1688, the begiinning of the &s;ame Year of the Revo|lution,
Te&s;tifying that the Epi&s;copal Party never
abated or relented; that they were never &s;atiated
with Blood; but went on as long as they had Power,
even till they &s;aw the very Cloud hovering and
the Storm ready to break upon their Heads,
nor had their thir&s;t of Blood been quench'd
to this Day, or as long as their had been a faith|ful
<PB N="289" REF="388">
Mewber of the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> left alive,
had their Power la&s;ted; &s;o that it was the End of
their Government put an End to their Per&s;ecuti|ons,
and no Clemency, Pity or Compa&s;&s;ion in
them; no &s;uch things were &s;o much as named
among them.</P>
<P>This Ob&s;ervation puts me in mind of a brief
Story within the Compa&s;s of my own Knowledge,
of a Gentleman who was &s;et upon by a Furious
Ma&s;tive Dog: The Gentleman defended him&s;elf
with a Sword for &s;ome time, but the Ma&s;tive after
being very much wounded, got within his point
and fa&s;tned on his Arm, the Gentlaman being in
great Di&s;tre&s;s, and fearing every Moment that he
would quit his Arm and fa&s;ten upon his Throat,
had no other way to Ma&s;ter this Great Dog, but
being a large heavy Man, he ca&s;t him&s;elf flat
down upon the Dog with his other Elbow lying
on the Dogs Brea&s;t, and thus with the Weight of
his Body cru&s;h'd the Bea&s;t to Death, and upon
this he ob&s;erv'd that as the Dog dyed gradually
under him, &s;o fa&s;t and no fa&s;ter his Teeth loo&s;en'd
in his Arm; his Fury la&s;ted with his Life, and
both ended together.</P>
<P>The whole Story is applicable to the Purpo&s;e
in hand: The Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> was near worried
by this cruel Creature call'd Prelacy, and very
near &s;he was to being taken by the Throat and
de&s;troy'd. But &s;he fell at la&s;t upon the Ma&s;tive,
and cru&s;h'd him to Death, and as hedyed under her,
his Teeth loo&s;en'd, his bloody Feud abated, and
not one jot fa&s;ter; the per&s;ecuting Rage of <HI>Scots</HI>
Prelacy continued with its Life, died when
it died, and will revive if ever it revives, of
which we &s;hall &s;ee &s;ome Confirmation in the la&s;t

any Place whether Nece&s;&s;ity drove them, for
&s;afety of their Lives, and as opportunity of
E&s;cape offered; in which Countries they
were driven to great Di&s;tre&s;s; &s;uch as Want,
Cold and Hunger, having their Lives given
them indeed for a Prey; but being perfectly
de&s;titute of Friends, Shelter, Help or Re|lief;
other than what God was plea&s;ed to
rai&s;e them up by his Providence, and by the
Chri&s;tian Charity of Foreign Prote&s;tants.
The Number of the&s;e, have been e&s;teemed
by &s;uch as think they have made a mode&s;t
Calculation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">7000</NOTE> at above 7000.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e, that I may do Ju&s;tice to the
Charity of every Man, and every &s;ort of
Men, the Cruelty they &s;uffered at Home, and
the Extremities they &s;uffered abroad, were
&s;uch, as was even dete&s;ted by Papi&s;ts them|&s;elves;
and &s;ome of the Suffering People
have acknowledged, they have met with
Compa&s;&s;ion, even among the Roman Ca|tholicks;
who have expre&s;&s;ed their A&s;to|ni&s;hment,
that Prote&s;tants &s;hould exerci&s;e
&s;uch Inhumanities upon one another. In <HI>Eng|land</HI>
al&s;o they were often Harboured, Re|liev'd,
Entertain'd and Concealed, even by
&s;ome Charitable People, who were of them|&s;elves
Epi&s;copal, and Members of the E|&s;tabli&s;h'd
Epi&s;copal Church; but who ab|hor'd
the Cruelties and Inhumanities of
<PB N="292" REF="392">
the <HI>Scots</HI> Per&s;ecutors, and even abhorr'd the
Per&s;ecution it &s;elf.</P>
<P>Of tho&s;e who went then into voluntary
Bani&s;hment, or, as it may be rather &s;aid,
fled from the Face of their bloody Per&s;ecutors,
very few ever returned again to <HI>Scot|land,</HI>
the Number of Years being &s;uch, that
Age, together with the hard&s;hip of their
Sufferings, carried mo&s;t of them off before
the happy time of the Deliverance of their
Country arriv'd.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, there were abundance of
Innocent and Pious Sufferers, who were
ba&s;ely Murthred by the Soldiers and Per&s;e|cutors,
upon the Occa&s;ions and by the Me|thods
of which we have Spoken, being ge|nerally
kill'd in cold Blood, without Proce&s;s
of Law, Civil or Military, without vi&s;ible
Crime, Charge, or Examination: Of tho&s;e,

78 Murther'd by particular Per&s;ons, and I
am well a&s;&s;ur'd there were very many more,
and have hear'd, that a Per&s;on, whom I
have not met with, has the Names of above
420 more; but that Number I do not a|vouch.<NOTE PLACE="marg">498</NOTE></P>
<P>The Number really Executed, in the Pre|tended
cour&s;e of Ju&s;tice, and by the Sen|tence
of the cruel Per&s;ecutors, and who died
by the Hangman, as I am credibly Inform'd,
is very great, and I am told that about 362
are to be found on the &s;everal Books of
the Ju&s;ticiary, and Council Courts, upon Re|cord,

The Numbers of tho&s;e who Peri&s;hed thro' Cold,
Hunger, and other Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, Contracted in their
Flight into the Mountains, wandring without
Shelter or Harbour, in dreadful Winters, during
the long &s;pace of 28 Years Per&s;ecution, and who
often came home in &s;uch Extremities, as ju&s;t to
&s;tep into their own Hou&s;es to die, and &s;ome times
were, even in the Article of Death, di&s;patch'd
by the Murthering Soldiers: The&s;e were many
Thou&s;ands, and cannot be Calculated, but will
certainly make up more than the Number of
Eighteen Thou&s;and, mentioned above.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e, I &s;ay nothing of the Pillage and
Spoil of Goods, the turning Women and Chil|dren
out into the Fields, in Cold and Nakedne&s;s,

wondered rather, that any of tho&s;e People were
left, or that there were any found at the Revolu|tion;
tho' to the Honour of Truth, it mu&s;t be
own'd, that at the Revolution, their Number was
found to be greater than ever, Witne&s;s their rai|&s;ing
a Regiment of 800 Men in one Day, without
beat of Drum, for the Guard of the Convention,
and for the Service of their Prote&s;tant King; which
Regiment was compo&s;ed of Men, as &s;erious in
Religion towards God, as Re&s;olute in Arms for
their King and Country, and were Eminent in the
Army for pre&s;erving the Wor&s;hip of God among
them, for which they were call'd in Deri&s;ion, the
P&s;alm Singing Regiment. Their Noble Colonel,
<PB N="295" REF="394">
the Earl of <HI>Angus,</HI> was kill'd at the Fight at
<HI>Steenkirk,</HI> where the Regiment behav'd with &s;uch
Gallantry, that the King him&s;elf gave Te&s;timony
of their Bravery, and is &s;till in being in the Army,
having lately given another happy In&s;tance of
their Behaviour at <HI>Pre&s;ton,</HI> where great Part of
them were Slain, and where, if they had not be|haved
with an uncommon Re&s;olution, the Rebels
had not been reduced as they were.</P>
<P>All the Account given of tho&s;e Things are

la&s;t Man they had Power to put to Death, and it
is as follows.</P>
<P>&startq;Spectators, (or if there be any of you) Auditors,
I mu&s;t tell you, I am come here
this Day to lay down my Life, for adhering to
the Truths of CHRIST, for which I am nei|ther
affraid nor a&s;ham'd to &s;uffer; Nay, I ble&s;s
the LORD, that ever he counted me worthy,
or enabled me to &s;uffer any thing for him; and
I de&s;ire to prai&s;e his Grace, that he hath not
only kept me free from the gro&s;s Pollutions of
the Time; but al&s;o from many ordinary Pollu|tions
of Children; and &s;uch as I have been
&s;tain'd with, he hath wa&s;hed me from them in
his own Blood. I am this Day to lay down my
Life, for the&s;e three Things. (1.) For di&s;own|ing
the U&s;urpations and Tyranny of <HI>James</HI>
Duke of <HI>York.</HI> (2.) For preaching, That it
was unlawful to pay the <HI>Ce&s;s,</HI> expre&s;ly exacted
<PB N="194" REF="395">
for bearing down the Go&s;pel. (3.) For preach|ing,
That it was lawful for People to carry
Arms, for de&s;ending them&s;elves in their Meet|ings
for the per&s;ecuted Go&s;pel Ordinances. I
think a Te&s;timony for the&s;e is worth many
Lives, and if I had Ten hundred, I would think
it little enough to lay them all down for the

<P>&startq;Dear Friends, Spectators and (if any of you

Contendings that have been for the Work of

the Preaching of the Go&s;pel in the Fields, and
the Defending the &s;ame by Arms. I adjoyn my
Te&s;timony to all that hath been &s;eal'd by Blood,
&s;hed either on Scaffolds, Fields or Seas, for the
Cau&s;e of Chri&s;t. I leave my Te&s;timony again&s;t
Popery, Prelacy, Era&s;tiani&s;m, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Again&s;t all
Prophanity, and every thing contrary to &s;ound

<HEAD>THE

<P>_We are now happily come to the
End of this melancholly Part, and
the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> having now
gone thro' a long Series of Trou|ble
and Affiction, began to &s;ee a
glimp&s;e of that glorious Delive|rance
which was approaching: The Tyrannick and
illegal Attempts upon the Religion and Liberties
of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, as well as of the <HI>Scots,</HI>
began to &s;tir up that Nation to think of pre|&s;erving
them&s;elves from De&s;truction; and having
apply'd them&s;elves to the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> for
A&s;&s;i&s;tance, that glorious Per&s;on began to li&s;ten
to their Propo&s;al, and to make Preparations for
his coming into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="398">
In the Deliverance that follow'd, the Church of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> found her Deliverance al&s;o: For in the
Death of Civil Tyranny, Chri&s;tian Liberty re|vivd.</P>
<P>The Hi&s;tory of the coming of the Prince of
<HI>Orange</HI> to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Throne, is perfectly and
fully related in &s;o many Hi&s;tories, is recent in
the Memory of all People at the writing hereof,
and probably will &s;till be on &s;o many &s;ub&s;equent
Occa&s;ions pre&s;erv'd to Po&s;terity, that as it
does not immediately relate to our pre&s;ent Me|moirs:
So al&s;o I need not enter upon an Account
of it here, other than what is ab&s;olutely Nece&s;|&s;ary
to the Story I am relating.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o well known, that this Glorious Prince
having fini&s;h'd the Deliverance of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Nation, re&s;olv'd the &s;ame should extend to <HI>Scot|land;</HI>
and that <HI>as it is expre&s;s'd in his Declaration,</HI>
Religion &s;hould be &s;ettl'd in <HI>Scotland,</HI> in &s;uch a
manner as was mo&s;t agreeable to the Inclinations
of the People; from whence, and in the Con&s;e|quence
of which, we &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee many u&s;ful
Ob&s;ervations mo&s;t naturally drawn, pertinent to
the Ca&s;e now before us; and which, I &s;ee, all
have great Occa&s;ion to make mention of again in
the Proce&s;s of the&s;e Memoirs.</P>
<P>1. But AS <HI>it has been already made plain</HI> in the
fir&s;t Part of the&s;e Memoirs, that the beginning
of the Reformation in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the fir&s;t Re|formers
of <HI>Scotland</HI> were <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> and that
Epi&s;copacy &s;prung up there but from the Dege|neracy
of the Reformation: SO it will now, <HI>that</HI>
the Inclination of the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> Ran with
an irre&s;i&s;tible Torrent into <HI>Presbyteriani&s;m</HI> a|gain
at the Revolution, as it had always done
when it was left in the Choice of the People;
<PB N="299" REF="399">
and that as at the Revolution afore&s;aid, it was le&s;t
to the Nation by the <HI>Prince of Orange,</HI> to &s;ettle
Religion in &s;uch manner as was mo&s;t de&s;ir'd by
the People, not <HI>a Dog wag'd his Tongue</HI> again&s;t the
<HI>Presbyterian</HI> E&s;tabli&s;hment, <HI>not a Mouth gave a
Vote</HI> for <HI>Epi&s;copacy;</HI> nor was it &s;o much as nam'd
to the King as a Que&s;tion, whether the Incli|nation
of the People was for <HI>Epi&s;copacy</HI> or <HI>Pre&s;|bytery;</HI>
in&s;omuch, that the King was often heard
to &s;ay afterwards, that he wonder'd much what
was become of the Epi&s;copal Party, &s;eeing no
Man at the Revolution &s;o much as nam'd the
Word Epi&s;copacy to him, nor had the Party any
one to &s;peak for them, or one Word to &s;peak for
them&s;elves.</P>
<P>How they could, &s;ince that, have the Face to
&s;ay, <HI>e&s;pecially as they often did to the late Queen,</HI>
that they were &s;uperior in Number to the <HI>Pre&s;|byterians;</HI>
and that if the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> were
left free to Vote, they would carry it for Epi&s;|copacy,
<HI>I &s;ay,</HI> how they could &s;ay thus, would
be &s;trange to any that did not know how that
Party have, on all Occa&s;ions, made &s;uch Things
<HI>their Refuge,</HI> and the Refuge of their Prelatick
Hierarchy; and the Author of the&s;e Memoirs is
Thankful, that even at the Time they did &s;o, he
had the Honour in behalf of the Church of <HI>Scot|land,</HI>
to let her Late Maje&s;ty know how untrue
that Sugge&s;tion was, and to Convince her Mini|&s;try
how gro&s;ly tho&s;e Men endeavour'd to impo&s;e
upon <HI>England</HI> in that Ca&s;e, as they did at the
&s;ame Time in their Boa&s;t of the People receiving
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Service Book with willingne&s;s in <HI>Scot|land,</HI>
which Her Maje&s;ty was afterwards fully
&s;atisfy'd was a Cheat, and done only to amu&s;e the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Clergy, and get Money of them.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="400">
2. It is ob&s;ervable in the Revolution, that the
People of <HI>Scotland</HI> came all into the Principles of
the &s;uffering &s;incere Party, the &s;uffering Party kept
their own footing, and did not go over to them;
tho&s;e that had thro' Fear, or from Time-&s;erving
Principles, or for want of Zeal, or for any other
weak Rea&s;on con&s;ented, and, <HI>as I may call it,</HI>
taken &s;o low a Step, as to accept of Licen&s;es
from God's Enemies to &s;erve Chri&s;t; asking leave
of Men to Wor&s;hip God; a Duty and Debt which
they had a Natural and Divine Right to, without
bowing the Knee to <HI>Baal</HI> for it; I &s;ay, THESE,
far from ju&s;tifying or recommending the Practice,
openly recogniz'd the Zeal, Courage and Sin|cerity
of the Sufferers, honour'd them for it, and
rather de&s;ir'd to bury their own Compliances in
Silence and Forgetfulne&s;s, than to have it menti|on'd
or remember'd.</P>
<P>3. Now it was &s;een, and made plain to the
World, that the &s;uffering People in <HI>Scotland</HI> acted
upon no Principles of Enthu&s;ia&s;m, blind Zeal
or religious Frenzy, <HI>as their Enemies &s;ugge&s;ted;</HI>
that they were no Enemies to Monarchy, Civil
Government, order of Society, and the like, <HI>as
had been &s;candalou&s;ly &s;aid;</HI> but that they kept &s;trict|ly
to the Rule of God's Word, adher'd to an
hone&s;t Cau&s;e, and acted upon ju&s;t Principles:
And when &s;uch Kings were call'd to the Throne,
as de&s;ir'd to Rule for God, and the Good of the
People, who made the Laws of God and Man
<HI>the Rule</HI> of their Government, and the Pro&s;perity
of Religion, and of their Subjects <HI>the End of it;</HI>
they knew how to obey, &s;erve and defend &s;uch
Princes with their Blood and Trea&s;ure, as well
as they had Courage to re&s;i&s;t and reject tho&s;e,
who, with the Breach of Faith, Honour or Con|&s;titution,
became Tyrants and Per&s;ecutors, Ene|mies
<PB N="301" REF="401">
<HI>mies</HI> to God, and De&s;troyers of Men, as their
former Princes had been.</P>
<P>This is evident by their Practice, at the Re|volution;
in that no &s;ooner was the <HI>Prince</HI> of
<HI>Orange</HI> Landed in <HI>England,</HI> and the Enemies of
our Con&s;titution began to &s;tagger, but the&s;e Peo|ple
immediately took Arms, and &s;ucce&s;sfully
chas'd <HI>the bloody Party,</HI> out of their Country.
But when this was done, <HI>what Mea&s;ures did they
take?</HI> Did they run into any Enthu&s;ia&s;m? Did
they &s;et up KING JESUS as a Temporal Prince,
and the fifth Monarchy in his Name? Did they
Preach the Doctrine of <HI>Dominion founded on Grace,</HI>
or form Schemes of Republican Government?
Did they erect them&s;elves as Tyrants in the Room
of tho&s;e they pull'd down, &s;o making the Peo|ple
change their Ma&s;ters, not their Yoke? NO,
NO, they adher'd to the Legal Con&s;titution of
their Country, they &s;ubmitted chearfully to the
Return of Magi&s;tracy, and the free Cour&s;e of the
Laws, of their Country, they arm'd them&s;elves,
and came up to <HI>Edinburgh</HI> at their own Charge,
form'd them&s;elves into Companies; <HI>indeed, they
were able to have form'd a con&s;iderable Army,</HI> and
offer'd them&s;elves to March to any Part of the
Nation again&s;t the Popi&s;h and Jacobite Party;
and e&s;pecially they offer'd, and were accepted,
and admitted to Guard the <HI>Convention of E&s;tates,</HI>
again&s;t the Attempt of the Duke of <HI>Gordon,</HI> who
at that Time commanded a Popi&s;h Gari&s;on in the
Ca&s;tle of <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> and again&s;t all, of any De|nomination
that &s;hould attempt to Di&s;turb them;
and to the eternal Honour of the wild Antimo|narchical,
Enthu&s;ia&s;tick, Lunatick <HI>Cameronians,
for &s;o their Enemies had call'd them;</HI> they were the

<DIV3>
<P>From this Time forward till the Union, we
&s;carce ever heard of the <HI>Cameronians:</HI> Their Sepa|ration
before was evident from ju&s;t Rea&s;ons, their
not complying with indul'ed Liberty, accepting
that from their Enemies which was their Native
Right, and by which they mu&s;t recognize the
Right and Superiority of Epi&s;copal Juri&s;diction,
which they abhor'd, this was all founded on
Con&s;cience and in ju&s;t Exceptions: But when up|on
the Revolution, and upon King <HI>William</HI>'s e&s;ta|bli&s;hing
their antient Liberty, and that Epi&s;co|pacy was depos'd,
as we &s;hall &s;ee pre&s;ently: They
appeared to be all one united Body of Presbyteri|ans,
one Church, under one Religious Govern|ment
and Admini&s;tration; the &s;ame in Opinion,
the &s;ame in Doctrine, Discipline, Wor&s;hip, and
Government, having fewer Breaches, fewer Di|vi&s;ions,
fewer fallings off to a differing Opinion,
than any Prote&s;tant Church in the World.</P>
<P>It remains then that our Memoirs give a brief
Account of the Re&s;toration of the Church upon
this great Turn of Affairs, and this &s;hall be done
&s;o conci&s;ely, and with &s;uch regard to what has
been made public already on other Occa&s;ions, that
I hope none &s;hall think their Time lo&s;t in looking
back, or think the Relation a vain Repetition.</P>
<P>According to the Prayer of the above Petition,
King <HI>William</HI> was declared King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the
Crown was tendred to him, and accepted by him
in Form, in Conjunction with Queen <HI>Mary.</HI> The
Act of Tender, the Claim of Right, the King's
Acceptance, with his Maje&s;ty's Letter to the
<PB N="309" REF="409">
Meeting of E&s;tates concerning his accepting the
Crown, and the remarkable Oaths taken by the King
and Queen on that Occa&s;ion, are all to be found
in the Collection of Public Acts of <HI>Scotland,</HI> Vol. 3.
P. 147, 153, 156, 159, 187. As &s;oon as the&s;e
Things were done, the Convention of E&s;tates were
turned into a Parliament, and from thence forward
began to Act as the Public Legi&s;lature of the Nati|on.
I &s;ay no more of the Particulars, becau&s;e
they are to be found in all the Hi&s;tories of that
Time: But it is to our pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e to Note,
that therewith <HI>Per&s;ecution</HI> entirely cea&s;ed, <HI>Epi&s;copacy</HI>
&s;unko into its Primitive State of Ob&s;curity, <HI>the
Per&s;ecutors</HI> fled on all Hands from Ju&s;tice; <HI>The ba|ni&s;h'd,</HI>
and pro&s;crib'd, &s;uch as were left alive re|turned
to their Families, Friends and Native
Country. Religion now began to hold up its
Head, the Godly per&s;ecuted Mini&s;ters and People
&s;hewed their Faces, and po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the Seat of their
Enemies.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Act of Parliament (after that for turn|ing
the Convention into a Parliament, and ano|ther
to recognize the King's Authority,) was the
Act for abolishing Epi&s;copacy: This makes it
abundantly clear, that the general Bent and Incli|nation
of the People was for Presbytery, and that
Epi&s;copacy was their Aver&s;ion, for that the very
fir&s;t Act after con&s;tituting the Civil Government,
was this of aboli&s;hing the Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Govern|ment
I &s;ay the fir&s;t, becau&s;e as there were but
two Acts which pa&s;t before it, one for turn|ing
the Meeting into a Parliament, the other for
recognizing the King's Authority; 'tis evident
without the&s;e they could not have acted at all,
and therefore the Act for aboli&s;hing Prelacy may
be &s;aid to be the fir&s;t Act they made, after the
Power of acting was confirmed.</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="410">
The Act for aboli&s;hing Prelacy is very remark|able,
and can not be omitted without manife&s;t De|fect
in our Work, it is as follows.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ACT aboli&s;hing PRELACY.
July 22d 1689.</HEAD>
<P>&startq;WHereas the E&s;tates of this Kingdom in
their Claim of Right or the 11th of <HI>April</HI>
la&s;t declared that Prelacy, and the Superiority
of any Office in the Church, about Presbyters, is
and hath been a great and in&s;upportable Grie|vance
Nation, and contrary to the Incli|nation
of the generality of the People ever
&s;ince the Reformation; they having reform'd
from Popery by Presbyters, and therefore ought
to be abolished. OUR SOVEREIGN LORD
and LADY the King and Queens Maje&s;ty, with
Advice and Con&s;ent of the E&s;tates of Parlia|ment,
do hereby <HI>aboli&s;h Prelacy</HI> and all Superio|rity
of any Office in. the Church of this King|dom
above Presbyters; and hereby re&s;cinds
Ca&s;es, and annulls the 1 Act, 2 Se&s;&s;. the fir&s;t

all other Acts, Statutes and Con&s;titutions in &s;o
far allanerly, as they are incon&s;i&s;tent with this
Act, and do aboli&s;h Prelacy, or the Superiority
of Church Officers above Presbyters; and do de|clare,
that they with the Advice and Con&s;ent
of the E&s;tates of this Parliament, will &s;ettle by
Law that Church Government in this Kingdom,
which is mo&s;t agreeable to the Inclinations of
the People.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="411">
This was a &s;hort Se&s;&s;ion, the Meeting requi|ring
nothing of publick Bu&s;ine&s;s at that Time but
tho&s;e three Nece&s;&s;ary Acts: They met again in
<HI>April,</HI> and then the &s;econd Act pa&s;s'd, was to do
Ju&s;tice to the poor per&s;ecuted &s;uffering Mini|sters,
who had been driven out by the Fury of
the late Times; By this Act all the Mini&s;ters who
had been &s;o driven away, or as the Law expre&s;&s;es,
it <HI>Thru&s;t from their Churches,</HI> from the 1&s;t of <HI>Jan.</HI>
1661&punc; to that Time &s;hould be forthwith admit|ted
and allow'd free Acce&s;s to their Churches,
from which they were &s;o Thru&s;t out; that &s;o
they might pre&s;ently Exerci&s;e their Mini&s;try in
their &s;everal $ari&s;hes without any new Call, and
the pre&s;ent Incumbents are order'd to give Place
to them, and remove them&s;elves.</P>
<P>This was not Per&s;ecution, <HI>as &s;ome would have
&s;til'd it,</HI> but re&s;toring the per&s;ecuted, and re|moving
Intruders, for they were no other; and
this was previous to any Church Settlement, be|cau&s;e
it was no more than putting the injur'd
Men into Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their Legal Right: All this
while Epi&s;copacy held its Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in general,
tho' its Government was di&s;&s;olv'd.</P>
<P>But the fifth Act of the &s;ame Se&s;&s;ion of Parlia|ment
laid the Ax to the Root of the Tree; this
was that famous Act, entitul'd, <HI>For ratifying the Confe&s;&s;ion
of Faith, and &s;ettling Presbyterian Church
Government;</HI> the Law it&s;elf is too long to be re|printed
here, it is to be found in the Collection
of Acts, <HI>Vol. 3. Page</HI> 206. to 234.</P>
<P>As the Government of the Church was now
re&s;tor'd, &s;o were her Judicatories of Cour&s;e; and
at this Time began the fir&s;t free General A&s;&s;em|bly,
which for eight and twenty Years had not been
&s;een in <HI>Scotland;</HI> it is needle&s;s here to enter into
the detail of the Acts of A&s;&s;embly, which are
<PB N="312" REF="412">
all to be found in the Regi&s;ters of the Church;
'tis enough to our Purpo&s;e to Record, that now
the Church was re&s;tor'd to the full and free Ex|erci&s;e
of her Ju&s;t and Legal Authority, the Judi|catures
were erected in their proper Places, &s;uch
as Kirk Se&s;&s;ions, Presbytery, Synod, and A&s;&s;em|bly,
and all Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Ju&s;tice ran in its pro|per
Channel.</P>
<P>Before I go on to what has &s;ince happen'd, in
Con&s;equence of this Revolution in the Church, it
will be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay &s;omething here to that
Challenge, which &s;ome have been very forward
to bring again&s;t the Church, of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as if &s;he
were al&s;o of per&s;ecuting Principles, and had exer|ci&s;ed
the &s;ame Coertion in point of Con&s;cience
in her Turn, which &s;he had condemn'd in others;
this they have carried on even to the Charge of
Cruelty and Per&s;ecution in the Treatment and U|&s;age
of the Epi&s;copal Mini&s;ters who were di&s;po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd
by tho&s;e Two Acts, <HI>viz. Of aboli&s;hing Prela|cy,
and &s;ettling Presbyterian Church Government.</HI></P>
<P>This Charge con&s;i&s;ts of Two Parts, in clearing
up both which, the Honour and Character of the
Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> will not only be vindicated,
but the Inju&s;tice and indeed the Ingratitude of the
Epi&s;copal People, who have brought this Charge,
will very much appear; and a quite contrary Be|haviour
will be made out to have been the Pra|ctice
of the pre&s;ent Government.</P>
<Q><P>1. The fir&s;t Re&s;pects the Conduct of the
People, when they took up Arms in a tu|multuous
Manner at the Beginning of the
Revolution.</P>
<P>2. The next Re&s;pects the judicial Proceedings
again&s;t the Epi&s;copal Party &s;ince, in both
<PB N="313" REF="413">
which, there needs no more for the Vin|dication
of the Church, than that the
Truth of Fact &s;hould be impartially &s;ta|ted.</P></Q>
<P>As to the fir&s;t it is true, That as &s;oon as the
News came to <HI>Scotland</HI> that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>
was landed, with an Army in <HI>England,</HI> and that
King <HI>James</HI> was not able to maintain his Ground
the People of <HI>England</HI> enclining to a general Re|volt:
The People in the We&s;t of <HI>Scotland,</HI> for
they were the fir&s;t, ran immediately to Arms,
and declared for the Prince of <HI>Orange:</HI> This was
done with &s;o Univer&s;al a Re&s;olution, and the
Con&s;ternation the other People were in at the Ge|neral
Face of Things, was &s;uch at the &s;ame Time,
that there was no Capacity, or even Di&s;po&s;ition
to oppo&s;e them.</P>
<P>In this general Defection from the Government,
the We&s;tern People not only took Arms, as is
&s;aid; but ran in a Tumultuous manner, fir&s;t upon
the Church Affairs, for there it was that the Op|pre&s;&s;ions
of the former Times had been mo&s;t &s;en|&s;ibly
felt: In this fir&s;t Fury it cannot be won|dered
that they di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the Epi&s;copal Mini|&s;ters
(Curates, as they call'd them) of their Churches,
and re&s;toring the old Wor&s;hip, cau&s;ed their own
bani&s;h'd per&s;ecuted Mini&s;ters to come and preach
among them: But the Nature of all &s;uch Rabbles
con&s;ider'd, and above all the Sufferings and Provo|cation
of tho&s;e poor People, and of which I have
given &s;ome Account; being duly weigh'd, it mu&s;t
be confe&s;s'd to be wonderful, that any kind of
Violence was forborn, not that I allow it was
ju&s;t to have committed them; but how could
le&s;s have been expected from a People &s;o treated
<PB N="314" REF="414">
as they had been when, they were thus perfectly
let loo&s;e to thier own Re&s;entments.</P>
<P>Yet we do not find that the utmo&s;t Violence
complained of, amounts to any more than an over
ha&s;ty turning the &s;aid Epi&s;copal Mini&s;ters out of
the Par&s;onage Hou&s;es, which it was their Opinion
were unlawfully po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, and &s;ome injurious hur|rying
their Goods out with them; and this but to
a few: But as to any per&s;onal Injury, &s;uch as
wounding or killing of any, I do not find that any
&s;uch Thing is charged upon them.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, when we reflect, how ma|ny
mu&s;t be among tho&s;e Rabbles who had &s;uffered
deeply in the Persecution, I have &s;poken of; who
had lo&s;t Fathers, Mothers, Children, Husbands,
Wives, and the deare&s;t of remoter Relations in
that Persecution, and could not be without the
warme&s;t Re&s;entment; add to this, that &s;ome of
tho&s;e Mini&s;ters or Curates, who they were then
di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, had dipt their Hands too much in the
Per&s;ecution of tho&s;e poor Sufferers: I &s;ay, if the&s;e
things were duly con$ider'd, what can be &s;aid, but
that it was next to miraculous, that an ungovern'd
Multitude, left to the full Vent of their own Rage;
and that Rage grounded upon &s;uch ju&s;t Provocati|ons
&s;hould have left any of them alive and I can
not think it any Breach of Charity to &s;ay, its
very probable had the Parties been chang'd, it
would have been quite otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>And tho' any tumultuous Violences are not
justifiable in a civiliz'd Chri&s;tian Nation, yet the
the Conduct of the&s;e People at that Time, with
their Provocations and Circum&s;tances con&s;ider'd, is
a great Te&s;timony of the Moderation of the Pre&s;|byterians
in <HI>Scotland:</HI> The Scripture makes this an
extraordinary Ca&s;e, 1 <HI>Sam. 24. 19. If a Man find
<PB N="315" REF="415">
his Enemy, will he let him go well away:</HI> yet when
the Presbyterian People in <HI>Scotland</HI> had their Ene|my
in their Hands, for &s;o at this Time they had,
they left their Revenge to him <HI>to whom Vengeance
belongs;</HI> and contenting them&s;elves with putting it
out of the Power of their Enemies to do any more
Mi&s;chief for the Time to come, they meddled
not with punishing them for what was pa&s;t.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing tho&s;e Rabbles did commit &s;ome
Violences, as to Plunder, and as to Per&s;onal Rud|ne&s;s
to the Mini&s;ters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who they turned out,
which yet I have not met with any Account of:
This is fully an&s;wered in a Book formerly written
on that Subject, in the&s;e Words.</P>
<P><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Presbyserian Per&s;ecution, p. 9. 10.</NOTE> &startq;What's this to the Church? It might be

that &s;o effectually clears the Church of this
Charge, that I cannot but wonder, the Party
could ever make u&s;e of it as an Argument, or
bring this Matter of Rabbling into the Charge;
<PB N="316" REF="416">
And that is, That the&s;e Tumults, Plunderings,
And Driving away the Epi&s;copal Mini&s;ters, were
all done and over, before there was any &s;uch
thing as a Presbyterian Church; I mean, e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd,
or in any Power to Act as a Judicatory,
or as a Body; So that, to charge the Church
with this, is like Indicting a Man for a Mur|der
committed before he was born.&endq;</P>
<P>This I think may &s;erve to clear up the fir&s;t
Head, <HI>viz.</HI> the Conduct of the Rabble, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I come next to the general Proceedings of the
Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> as a Church after their
Restoration, or new E&s;tabli&s;hment: How they were
&s;ettled by Act of Parliament, has been already
ob&s;erv'd; it remains to enquire how they acted
when &s;ettled, and whether either the Civil Govern|ment
or Church Government, can be ju&s;tly char|ged
with Per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>&startq;It could not be expected, but that, upon the
Revolution, the Prelatic Tyranny would fall
with the Regal; And, were it worth Examin|ing
into, it would be ea&s;y to prove, there was
an inevitable Nece&s;&s;ity it &s;hould do &s;o, they
being &s;o effectually &s;upported one by another,
that they could not but &s;tand and fall together.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That the conjunct Tyranny of both Church
and State had treated the Presbyterians with
&s;uch an Impolitic Fury, as mu&s;t imply, they had
not the lea&s;t Apprehension of being ever pull'd
down again by them, is very evident from the pa|ticulars,
which make up the former Part of the&s;e
Memoirs. But to return to the Hi&s;tory.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="417">
The Bi&s;hops being Depo&s;ed, and the Presbyte|rian
Government and Di&s;cipline re&s;tored in the
Church: The fir&s;t thing the A&s;&s;embly went upon
was, to con&s;ider of planting Mini&s;ters in the Va|cant
Churches; for it could, not be, but that in
Eight and Twenty Years of Cruelty and Blood
which they had &s;uffered under, and which I have
given &s;ome Account of in the&s;e Memoirs, a great
Number of the ancient Mini&s;ters were fallen; be|&s;ides
that, even the length of Time, would by the
Cour&s;e of Nature carry a great many off the Stage.
<HI>And &s;o it was,</HI> even to &s;uch a Degree, that it was
at fir&s;t not very ea&s;y to find Mini&s;ters to &s;upply
Churches from which, the Epi&s;copal Mini&s;ters or
Curates were nece&s;&s;arily to be removed.</P>
<P>And here again the pretence of Per&s;ecution is
brought as a Plea again&s;t the displacing tho&s;e In|cumbents,
who would not quality them&s;elves ac|cording
to Law: But neither will it hold in this
Ca&s;e neither; See the Words of the &s;ame Author,
upon the &s;ame Subject, where he gives the follow|ing
brief Hi&s;tory of the fir&s;t Step taken in this
Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>The Government, &s;ays he, was no &s;ooner e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd
by the Revolution, and the Kirk re&s;tor'd to
her Judicatorial Authority but her &s;everal Courts,
as Se&s;&s;ion, Presbytery, Synod and A&s;&s;embly, took
their Cour&s;es, and began to Act.</P>
<P>By the fir&s;t Act of Parliament for &s;ettling the&s;e
Matters, pa&s;t <HI>June</HI> 7. 1690. Intituled, <HI>Act Ratify|ing
the Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith, And Settling Presbyterin
Church Government;</HI> It is ordain'd, <HI>That the General
A&s;&s;embly the Mini&s;ter and Elders, &s;hould have
Power to try and purge out al In&s;ufficient, Scandelous,
<PB N="318" REF="418">
and Erroneous Mini&s;ters, by due Cour&s;e of Eccle&s;iati|cal
Proce&s;s and Cen&s;ures:</HI> But this Act no where Im|power'd
them to Cen&s;ure any who were not In|&s;ufficient,
Scandalous, or Erroneous, tho' they
would not take the Oaths to the Government&mdash;
So that, by this Law, the Church could not be
capable of Per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>It may be objected here, That to be Epi&s;copal,
might beadjudged Erroneous by this Judicatory, and
&s;o come under the Church Cen&s;ure, by Authority
of this Act.</P>
<P>To this 'tis replied&mdash;, Fir&s;t, <HI>In Fact,</HI> No Man
was ever &s;ince the Revolution Depo&s;ed by the
Church, meerly for being Epi&s;copal, nor was any
Proce&s;s ever commenc'd again&s;t any Man on that
Foundation.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> It was particularly declared by the
Fir&s;t General A&s;&s;embly after the Revolution, <HI>viz.</HI>
in the Sixth Se&s;&s;ion, in the Year 1690, <HI>That this
A&s;&s;embly will Depo&s;e no Incumbents &s;imply for their
Judgment anent the Government of the Church, and
&V;rge Re-ordination upon them. Vide Index</HI> of the
Unprinted Acts of the A&s;&s;embly, <HI>Se&s;&s;</HI> 6, 1690.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame A&s;&s;embly, in their In&s;tructions gi|ven
to their Commi&s;&s;ion, which was to &s;it during
their Rece&s;s, we have the&s;e Words;</P>
<P>That they be very Cautious of receiving Information,
again&s;t the late Conformi&s;ts; And that they proceed in
the Matter of Cen&s;ure very Deliberately, &s;o as none
may have ju&s;t Cau&s;e to complain of their Rigidity; And
that the &s;hall not proceed to Cen&s;ure, but upon relevant
Libels and &s;ufficient Probation, <HI>Act 15th, Se&s;&s;. 26th,
A&s;&s;embly</HI> 1690.</P>
<P>Again, le&s;t the Presbyterians &s;hould be ra&s;h and
&s;evere the Commi&s;&s;ion is impower'd as follows,
<HI>That if they &s;hall be inform'd of any precipitant Proce|dure
<PB N="319" REF="419">
of the Presbyterians in &s;uch Proce&s;&s;es, to restrain
them, Vide the &s;ame Act as above.</HI></P>
<P>If then they were thus Moderate even in Scan|dalous
Things, and declared again&s;t proceeding in
Ca&s;es meerly Eyi&s;copal, where &s;hall we find the
Article of Per&s;ecution?</P>
<P>'Tis true, That in the Year 1693, an Act of
Parliament was made to Deprive all &s;uch Mini|sters,
as would not both Swear to the Govern|ment,
and Acknowledge the Church Government
al&s;o, and the Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith&mdash;. But the
Occa&s;ion of this Act is vi&s;ible to all that know
the Affairs of that Time, <HI>viz.</HI> That it was pa&s;t
to &s;atisfy the Minds of the People, who were ex|ceedingly
di&s;turb'd at the Churches having been
In&s;ulted in the A&s;&s;embly 1692, by a general <HI>For|mula</HI>
procured by the Epi&s;copal Clergy, together
with their Appeal to the King on a Refu&s;al: And
the A&s;&s;embly being abruptly Di&s;&s;olved, or Di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed
<HI>&s;ine die,</HI> which put the Nation into a very
great Ferment.</P>
<P>Yet, even upon this Act, I may challenge the
Epi&s;copal Clergy to &s;how me one Mini&s;ter, that
ever was Depo&s;ed for not acknowledging the
Church, if at the &s;ame Time he offered to ac|knowledge
the Government, and take the Oaths,
and they have been often challenged on this Head.</P>
<P>And to confirm this Lenity of Practice by a
Law, that famous Act of Parliament was made in
the Year 1695, wherein taking the Oaths to the
Government is made the <HI>Onely</HI> and <HI>Fully Sufficient</HI>
Qualification, and all Mini&s;ters that would &s;o <HI>Qua|lifie
them&s;elves</HI> are continued. As may be &s;een at
large by the Act, Intituled, <HI>Act concerning the
Church, Anno</HI> 1695.</P>

<P><PB N="320" REF="422">
This very Act of Parliament, if I were to go
no further, effectually clears the Church of <HI>Scot|land</HI>
from the Charge of Per&s;ecution; &s;ince 'tis
plain there was no religious Tenet in di&s;pute, but
a civil Que&s;tion of owning or not owning the Go|vrenment.</P>
<P>It was by this Act of Parliament taken quite out
of the Power of the Church, to Depo&s;e any Man
meerly for being Epi&s;copal in Principle, or for
refu&s;ing to own the Presbyterian Church; nay,
the Epi&s;copal Clergy, who by vertue of this Act,
remain in their Livings, many of them to this
Day, refu&s;e to acknowlege the Church, to &s;ubmit
to any of her Judicatories, or to join, either in
Di&s;cipline or Wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>How impo&s;&s;ible it is then to be true, that the
Presbyterian Church has been guilty of Per&s;ecuti|on,
I leave to any Impartial Reader to judge; ad|ding
withal, what was publi&s;hed in the &s;ame Ca&s;e,
<HI>viz.</HI> That there was at the Time of the Union
One hundred and &s;ixty five Epi&s;copal Mini&s;ters then
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing Churches and Stipends in <HI>Scotland</HI> by the
Lenity and Forbearance of the Government, who
had no other Qualification required of them, than
the taking the Oaths to the Government, and
were not bound to, neither did they comply with,
or &s;ubmit to the Presbyterian Church; and a Li&s;t
of their Names has been publi&s;hed, and of the
the Pari&s;hes in which they Re&s;ide; nay, in &s;everal
Pari&s;hes where the&s;e Epi&s;copal Mini&s;ters are In|cumbent,
the Presbyterians are at the Expence to
have a Mini&s;ter of their own, who they maintain,
and who Preaches in a Meeting Hou&s;e at their own
private Expence: Take the Ca&s;e in the Words for|merly
publi&s;h'd thus.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="423">
It would be plea&s;ant for People who charge the
Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> with per&s;ecuting the Epi&s;copal
Clergy, to go to &s;ome of the&s;e Paroches and &s;ee
this uncouth Je&s;t, where the per&s;ecuting e&s;tabli&s;h|ed
Church is fain to &s;ubmit to a Meeting-Hou&s;e,
and the per&s;ecuted Epi&s;copal Clergy-man in&s;ults
them from the Pari&s;h Church, and keeps both the
Pulpit and the Stipend in &s;pight of them all&mdash;
Here is the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Church turn'd Di&s;&s;enter,
and the Di&s;&s;enter made the Incumbent, the Per|&s;ecutor
become per&s;ecuted, and <HI>per contra</HI> the per|&s;ecuted
made the Per&s;ecutor.</P>
<P>Thus the Church has re-obtain'd her E&s;tabli&s;h|ment,
and here &s;he may be &s;aid to be arrived at
the full extant of her Militant State, flouri&s;hing
in Peace, and the Wounds of her afflicted State
healing apace.</P>
<P>It remains as a proper Clo&s;e to this Work, that
&s;omething &s;hould be &s;aid concerning this de&s;pi&s;ed
persecuted Church in General, a Body of Chri|&s;tians
placed thus, as it were in the remote&s;t part
of the World, in whom however God has been
plea&s;ed &s;o eminently to appear, and for whom to
do &s;uch great Things as has been here related.</P>
<P>Now &s;he enjoy'd her full E&s;tabli&s;hment, I mean
ju&s;t before the Union: After the <HI>&V;nion,</HI> Attempt
that Epi&s;copacy could make upon her could over|throw
her Settlement, without overthrowing at
the &s;ame Time the whole Con&s;titution of <HI>Great
Britain.</HI> What Attempts have been made upon
her during the Intere&s;t which her Enemies had in
the Administration, at the latter End of the la&s;t
Reign, have rather &s;cratch'd her Face, than touch'd
her Vitals, and have rather &s;hewed their De&s;ign
than their Power: Whether &s;he will obtain that
<PB N="322" REF="424">
Ju&s;tice to have tho&s;e Injuries redre&s;s'd now the
whole Government is re&s;tor'd, I cannot yet &s;ay,
nor does it relate to the pre&s;ent part of this
Work.</P>
<P>Her Government, Di&s;cipline and Wor&s;hip, are
e&s;tabli&s;h'd now by Treaty, and have the A&s;&s;ent of
an Epi&s;copal Church and Nation as a Sanction to
it: The Act for her Security is Incorporated into,
and made a part of the Act of Union; and the
e&s;tabli&s;hing the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> is there called
the e&s;tabli&s;hing the true Prote&s;tant Religion.</P>
<P>I know but Two Things which the Church of
<HI>Scotland</HI> can be &s;aid to complain of, or to ask more
than was at this Time granted to her; and tho&s;e
there is &s;ome Rea&s;on to fear &s;he never will obtain,
but as they are not E&s;&s;ential to Religion it &s;elf, I
&s;hall not lay too great a &s;tre&s;s upon them.</P>
<P>1. That the Revenues of the Church, I mean
of the Archbi&s;hops, and Bi&s;hops, Deans, Chapters,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> when they were Depo&s;ed, and Epi&s;copacy
Aboli&s;hed, were not appropriated to the U&s;es of
the Church, as indeed they ought to have been,
but divided like the Spoil of the Revolution among
the Nobility and Gentry: Had this been done,
there had been a Fund for the Service of the
Church, which would have been &s;ufficient to have
an&s;wer'd &s;everal Wants, which in Default of this
Supply, &s;he feels the Effects of, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>1. There had been a Supply for &s;upporting
Students in the Colleges for the Study of
Divinity, and to have enlarged the Sti|pends
of the Regents or Tutors in the &s;aid
Colleges, which were at that Time very
low; and not &s;uitable to the Labour and
Application requi&s;ite in tho&s;e, Offices: The
latter was &s;o evident, that the late Queen
<PB N="323" REF="425">
was plea&s;ed to add considerably out of her
own Pur&s;e, as an encrea&s;e of Sallery amount|ing
in the whole. as I have heard, to
about 300 <HI>l.per Annum.</HI></P>
<P>2. There had been a Fund to encrea&s;e the
Stipends of Mini&s;ters in remote Pari&s;hes,
where they were too &s;mall, to encourage
the Incumbents and &s;upport their Familes
in waiting upon their Work.</P>
<P>3. There would have been a Fund to have
bred up Mini&s;ters to act as Mi&s;ionaries for
the <HI>Highlands,</HI> to &s;tudy the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Language,
and qualify them&s;elves to go into the re|mote&s;t
Parts to In&s;truct the poor Ignorant
Families of the <HI>Highlanders,</HI> and to &s;upport
them in &s;uch a Work: A Thing attempt|ed
&s;ince the Union, by a General Sub&s;crip|tion
for the <HI>Propagating Chri&s;tian Knowledge,</HI>
but I do not find the Succe&s;s an&s;wers the
Goodne&s;s of the De&s;ign.</P>
<P>4. There would have been a Fund to have an|&s;wered
the common Incidents of the
Church, &s;uch as &s;ending up Mini&s;ters to
<HI>London</HI> to &s;olicit Redre&s;s of Grievances,
upon any Occa&s;ion, and for every pub|lick
Tran&s;action with the Court. OR
<HI>which were very de&s;irable</HI> for the maintain|ing
an Agent con&s;tantly at <HI>London,</HI> to take
care of their Intere&s;ts, to pre&s;ent their
Addre&s;&s;es, recommend their Concerns, and
in a Word to manage their Affairs; all
which they are now obliged either to
want A&s;&s;i&s;tance in, or the Mini&s;ters <HI>who do
come up as Agents</HI> on extraordinary Occa&s;i|ons,
are oblig'd to bear their own Charges,
which is a Hard&s;hip many of them may not
be very well furni&s;h'd to bear.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="426">
2. Another Thing they complain of, is the
want of the Sanction of the Civil Power to en|force
Eccle&s;ia&s;tic Di&s;cipline and Cen&s;ure; for want
of which, ob&s;tinate Offenders are often encourag'd
to &s;tand out in Scandal and in wicked Practices, and
refu&s;e to &s;ubmit to the Sentences of the Church,
however ju&s;t, righteous, and moderate: This is
one Rea&s;on why the Nobility and Gentry very of|ten
live in Defiance of Eccle&s;ia&s;tic Judicatures
and Proce&s;s, even in the profe&s;s'd and avow'd
Commi&s;&s;ion of flagrant Crimes, &s;uch as bla&s;phe|mous
Swearing, open Drunkenne&s;s, Fornication,
and even Adultery it &s;elf; whereas were the Civil
Magistrate oblig'd to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the Execution of
Church Sentences, no Man would then be above
Reproof, and Puni&s;hment in ju&s;t Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>But as I &s;aid before, the&s;e Things do not at
all break in upon the Church; either in her Do|ctrine,
or in the Liberty of her Wor&s;hip; they
may indeed affect the E&s;tabli&s;hment of her Di&s;|cipline,
tho' not much, &s;o that <HI>by the Treaty of
&V;nion,</HI> it is to be hoped her la&s;t &s;truggle with
Epi&s;copacy is at an End; and &s;he may now be
able to &s;ay, that not only &s;he is arriv'd to her full
grown State, but that the Continuance of it is &s;e|cured
to her People and their Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>This brings to my Mind, a Reproach u&s;ually
ca&s;t on the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> by her Enemies,
or rather it may be call'd an In&s;ult, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That
Presbytery was often hatch'd in <HI>Scotland</HI> and nur|&s;ed
up. But was never <HI>Major;</HI> never came to be
<HI>of Age;</HI> alluding to a young Man, who tho' care|fully
brought up, dies before he attains to the
Age of One and Twenty; But that Je&s;t will &s;erve
them, no longer, &s;eeing it is now Eight and Twen|ty
<PB N="325" REF="427">
Year &s;ince the Revolution, and &s;ince the pa&s;|&s;ing
the Act for aboli&s;hing Epi&s;copacy; and yet
Presbytry not only remains, but &s;eems to be in a
better and more probable Way for Duration than
it ever has been &s;ince the Reformation.</P>
<P>It might be proper here to &s;ay a few Words by
way of Observation, concerning the pre&s;ent State
of the Di&s;cipline of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which
was confirm'd al&s;o at the Time of the Union, and
indeed I cannot refrain it for Two Rea&s;ons.</P>
<Q><P>1. That I think it is a Debt due to the Church
her &s;elf, who I find &s;uffer innumerable un|ju&s;t
Reproaches, and is contemptibly
thought of, not among her Enemies only,
but even among tho&s;e in <HI>England,</HI> who&s;e
Intere&s;t as well as Principles ought to
move them to inform them&s;elves better
concerning her, and who being better in|form'd,
ought to do more ju&s;tice to tho&s;e
who &s;o well de&s;erve it at their Hands.</P>
<P>2. That &s;he may be a Pattern to all the
&s;everal Sorts of Prote&s;tants in <HI>Britain,</HI> and
may &s;hew them by her Example, not only
what the Ble&s;&s;ing would be of an e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd
well executed Di&s;cipline in a Na|tional
Church, and of a laborious well re|gulated
Clergy, but al&s;o how ea&s;y it is to
attain to it.</P></Q>
<P>I &s;hall not examine into the Di&s;cipline of the
Two National Churches in this I&s;land, in order to
compare them, to recommend one of them as
better than the other: But for their due Emulation,
this I may &s;ay, that &s;uppo&s;ing the Rules of their
Discipline equally good, yet no Man will deny
Two Things.</P>
<Q><PB N="326" REF="428">
<P>1. That the Church of <HI>England</HI> Di&s;cipline is
the mo&s;t Neglected, the Execution of it
the mo&s;t Incumber'd, and the Pro&s;ecution
made the mo&s;t Difficult and Tedious, as well
as Expen&s;ive and Chargeable to the Pro&s;ecu|tor
of any Prote&s;tant Church in the World.</P>
<P>2. That the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI>'s Di&s;cipline is
the mo&s;t exact in Form, the mo&s;t ea&s;y and
cheap to the Pro&s;ecutor, and the mo&s;t
punctually and &s;trictly Executed, without
Partiality, Bribery, or any &s;ort of Cor|ruption,
as al&s;o without a tire&s;ome, tedi|ous
and dilatory Proceeding, of any Church
Di&s;cipline in the World.</P></Q>
<P>Some of the Con&s;equences of this, are the&s;e;</P>
<Q><P>1. The Mini&s;ters (for they are as much &s;ub|jected
to the Discipline of the Church as
the People, and perhaps more) are daily
and duly enquired into as to their Couduct,
and fail not to be Cen&s;ur'd if they give
occa&s;ion of Scandal in the &s;evere&s;t manner;
and in this Cen&s;uring of the Mini&s;ters in
<HI>Scotland,</HI> it is to be particularly ob&s;erv'd,
That Mini&s;ters have there a &s;everity u&s;ed
with them, if they offend, which the
common People have not, and which per|haps
no Ministers in the World but
the&s;e, are &s;ubject to, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That if a Mi|ni&s;ter
falls into any &s;candalous Crime, for
which he is Depo&s;ed, he is Depo&s;ed for
ever; a private Man is receiv'd again, af|ter
Scandal given, if he Repent and give
Satisfaction, but a Mini&s;ter never.</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="429">
NOTE, Upon Repentance and making
publick Acknowledgement to the Satisfa|ction
or the Church, he &s;hall be received
again to Communion as a Fellow Chri&s;ti|an,
but as a Mini&s;ter he is perfectly u&s;e|le&s;s,
and never can be repon'd,</P>
<P>NOTE <HI>al&s;o,</HI> That this &s;everity is not by
the Law of Di&s;cipline, but the Practice
and U&s;age of the Church, the People will
never hear or receive &s;uch a Man as a Mi|ni&s;ter.</P>
<P>NOTE <HI>Thirdly</HI> That the happy Conse|quences
of this Severity, and which mu&s;t
be mention'd to the Honour of the Church
of <HI>Scotland;</HI> IS, That there is not a Mini|&s;ter
now preaching and exerci&s;ing the Of|fice
of a Pa&s;tor in the whole Church of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> who can be charg'd with any Im|moralities
or &s;candalous Behaviour, except
&s;uch as are under Pro&s;ecution for the &s;ame.</P></Q>
<P>Could this be &s;aid of the Church of <HI>England,</HI>
or could it be &s;aid that all due Care, as far as her
own Laws would allow, was taken to bring it to
this, what a new Face would there be of Religion,
in this part of the I&s;land!</P>
<Q>2. The People are retrained in the Ordinary
Practice of Common Immorallitles, &s;uch
as Swearing, Drunkenne&s;s, Slander, For|nication,
Adultery and the like: As to
Theft, Murther, and other Capital Crimes,
they come under the Cogni&s;cance of the
Civil Magi&s;trate, as in other Countries;
<PB N="328" REF="430">
But in tho&s;e Things which the Church has
Power to puni&s;h, the People being con|&s;tantly
and impartially pro&s;ecuted, they
are thereby the more re&s;trained, kept &s;o|ber
and under Government, and you may
pa&s;s thro, Twenty Towns in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
without &s;eeing any Broil, or hearing an Oath
&s;worn in the Streets; whereas if a Blind
Man was to come from thence into <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
he &s;hall know the fir&s;t Town he &s;ets
his Foot in within the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Border, by
hearing the Name of God bla&s;phem'd and
prophanely u&s;ed, even by the very little
Children in the Street.</Q>
<P>Another Thing I cannot omit, in which the
Constitution of the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> is Singular
and Differing from her Neighbours, and this, is
that not the lea&s;t Room is left here for the popu|lar
Charge of Prie&s;t-craft, with which the Dei&s;ts,
Athei&s;ts and prophane People of this Age, Charge
the Ministers of the Go&s;pel of all Per&s;wa&s;ions, al|ledging
that all they do is either under the Awe of
the Great Ones, to pur&s;ue their Intere&s;t and Li|vings,
or with Wheedling and Delu&s;ion to win
upon the poor to make a Profit of them.</P>
<P>To the Honour of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> her
Mini&s;ters are &s;o &s;tated, as that (1.) They are under
no Influence, Awe, or Command from the Great
Ones; for the Stipend or Sallary of the Mini&s;ter
depends not upon the Lord or Patron, but is &s;et|tled
by Parliament, to be paid duly by the Here|tor,
or Per&s;on who receives the Tithes; and if he
refu&s;es or delays, the Mini&s;ter may demand it of
his Tenant, &s;o that the Mini&s;ters are wholly in|dependant
of the Gentry, how much &s;oever the
poor People are in Bondage to them.</P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="431">
(2.) As they can lo&s;e nothing by the Anger of
the Gentry, they can get nothing by Favour of the
Commonalty; and this is very remarkable, that
no Fees, no Perqui&s;ites, no Advantages are made
of any kind by the Mini&s;ter in his Pari&s;h, of or
from his People; He receives nothing for Burials,
Marriages, Bapti&s;ms, Vi&s;iting, or any other
Thing belonging to his Office as a Mini&s;ter; So
that he has nothing to Wheedle the People into,
or for. On the contrary, as he pre&s;ides in his
Kirk-Se&s;&s;ion or Ve&s;try, he is rather a Magistrate
or In&s;pector over the Lives and Conver&s;ations of
his Pari&s;hioners, than a Tool to plea&s;e and cajole
them, that he may get Money by them, as is too
much the Ca&s;e in <HI>England,</HI> and in other Coun|tries
al&s;o.</P>
<P>This Power of the Mini&s;ter in his Parochial
Juri&s;diction is that upon which Mr. <HI>Lauder,</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide Lauder,</HI> antient Bi&s;hops con&s;ider'd, cap. <HI>viii.</HI> page 316.</NOTE> in
that famous <HI>and yet unan&s;wered</HI> Book of his, argues,
That a private Pari&s;h Mini&s;ter in <HI>Scotland</HI> is a
compleat Dioce&s;an Bi&s;hop, according to <HI>Cypri|an,
and according to the Scripture In&s;titution of a</HI>
Bi&s;hop; pre&s;iding in Judicature over his Flock or
Dioce&s;s, being Ve&s;ted with the Power both to
Cen&s;ure and Ab&s;olve; and that the Government
of the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> by Kirk-Se&s;&s;ions, Pre&s;|byteries,
Synods, and General A&s;&s;emblies, is real|ty and
properly <HI>Epi&s;copal Government,</HI> to all Intents
and Purpo&s;es, as the Government of the Church
<HI>was Epi&s;copal</HI> in the Third and Fourth Centuries.</P>
<P>(30) The Office of a Mini&s;ter in the Church of
<HI>Scotland</HI> is a quite different Thing from the Office
<PB N="330" REF="432">
of a Mini&s;ter in <HI>England;</HI> that is to &s;ay, as it is
now Executed, either in the National Church or
among the Di&s;&s;enters; and it may be &s;aid without
an Hyperbole, that were the Mini&s;terial Office
&s;ubjected and di&s;charged in <HI>England,</HI> as it is in
<HI>Scotland,</HI> in that Laborious Self-denying Manner,
and under &s;uch &s;mall Encouragements, Thousands
of the Clergy, I dare &s;ay, would with to have
been brought up Mechanicks rather than Par&s;ons;
and &s;carce a Man that had any Temporal E&s;tate
to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on, would take the fatigue of the Gown
upon them. Here are no Drones, no Idle Par|&s;ons,
no pamper'd Prie&s;ts, no Dignities or Pre|ferments
to excite Ambition, no Pluralities and
Curacies to encourage Sloth, no Authority or
Power over one another to gratify Pride, no Ex|emtion
from the Laborious part, or Excu&s;e for
not performing it.</P>
<P>Every Mini&s;ter in <HI>Scotland</HI> preaches twice a Day,
and Lectures upon or Expounds a Chapter, or
part of a Chapter, before the Morning Sermon;
except only where in &s;ome large Pari&s;hes, there
are A&s;&s;i&s;tants or Collegues allowed; every Mini|&s;ter
is bound by his Office to Vi&s;it every Family in
his Pari&s;h mini&s;terially, and at lea&s;t once a Year to
Examine every examinable Per&s;on in his Pari&s;h:
Every Mini&s;ter is oblig'd in Conjunction with his
Elders, <HI>who with the Mini&s;ter compo&s;e the Kirk-Se&s;&s;ion,</HI>
to take Cogni&s;ance of and hear all Complaints again&s;t
the Morals of every Per&s;on in his Pari&s;h, and to pro|ceed
judicially as the Ca&s;e &s;hall require. Every
Mini&s;ter likewi&s;e is obliged to Vi&s;it the Sick in his
Pari&s;h, when ever they &s;end to him; nor is that
an ea&s;y Work in the Country where the Pari&s;hes
are large, and the Villages included in them re|mote
from one another.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="433">
Who ever con&s;iders the Office of a Mini&s;ter in
<HI>Scotland,</HI> how faithfully the Mini&s;ters there execute
it, how constantly they preach, how painfully they
Study, how diligently they Examine, how duly
they Vi&s;it, will ea&s;ily Account for that weak
Scandal that our People in <HI>England</HI> rai&s;e upon
them, <HI>(viz.) That we &s;ee none of their Writings:</HI>
And I &s;hall add to it, what a Worthy and Reve|rend
Divine of the Church of <HI>England</HI> &s;aid on
Occa&s;ion of that Reflection, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That if our
Mini&s;ters, as well of the Church, as the Di&s;&s;enters,
would Study more, Preach more, Vi&s;it, Comfort,
Examine and I&s;truct their People more, though
they wrote le&s;s, it would be better Service to the
Church, and they would more de&s;erve the Name
of Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>There are many other Laborious things which the
Mini&s;ters of the Church <HI>Scotland</HI> go thou&s;an'd, which
Ministers in England know nothing of; &s;uch as their
managing the Pari&s;h Charity, keeping the, Trea|&s;ure
for the Poor, for there are there neither
<HI>Church-Wardens</HI> or <HI>Over&s;eers,</HI> their Travelling to
reconcile Breaches and heal Divi&s;ions among their
People their Expensive Journeys Monthly to the
Presbyteries, half Yearly to the Synods, and an|nually
to the General A&s;&s;emblies, and the like:
All which &s;erve to make it true which was &s;aid by
an impartial Enquiror there, (<HI>viz.) That the Life
of an</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Porter</HI> was ea&s;y compar'd to that of a
Presbyterian Mini&s;ter in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>Yet all this is &s;upported and di&s;charged with &s;uch
Courage, &s;uch Temper, &s;uch Steadine&s;s in Applica|tion,
&s;uch unwearied Diligence, &s;uch Zeal and Vigour
in the Work, that our <HI>Engli&s;h Sermon-Readers</HI> know
little of, not having the &s;ame Support, <HI>and I fear,</HI>
not the &s;ame Spirit to carry them thro'; in a Word,
as they have a Work which, humane Strength, is
<PB N="332" REF="434">
hardly &s;ufficient to Discharge, &s;o they have a Sup|port
which humane Nature is not capable to &s;up|ply;
and I mu&s;t acknowlege that there &s;eems to
be &s;uch an Appearance of the Spirit and Presence
or God with and in this Church, as is not at this
Time to be &s;een in any Church in the World.</P>
<P>Farther, as there is among the Mini&s;ters a Spi|rit
of Zeal, and an earne&s;t devoting of all their
Powers, Faculties, Strength, and Time to their
Work, &s;o the Peoples Part is in proportion equal;
their Ta&s;te of Hearing, their Affection to their
Mini&s;ters, their Subjection to be In&s;tructed, and even
to Di&s;cipline; their eagerne&s;s to follow the Directi|ons
given; tho&s;e are Things &s;o vi&s;ible in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
that they are not to be de&s;crib'd but admir'd; To
&s;ee a Congregation &s;it with Looks &s;o eager, as if
they were to eat the Words as they came out of
the Mouths of the Preacher; to &s;ee the Affecti|on
with which they hear, that there &s;hall be a Ge|neral
Sound of a Mourning thro' the whole Church
upon the extraordinary warmth of Expre&s;&s;ion in
the Mini&s;ter, and this not affected and de&s;ign'd,
but ca&s;ual and undi&s;&s;embled.</P>
<P>And one Thing as a Hint, to <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hearers, I
cannot omit, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That in a whole Church full
of People, not one &s;hall be &s;een without a Bible,
a Cu&s;tom almo&s;t forgotten In <HI>England:</HI> On
the other Hand in a Church in <HI>Scotland,</HI> if you &s;hut
your Eyes when the Mini&s;ter Names any Text of
Scripture, you &s;hall hear a little ru&s;sling Noi&s;e over
the whole Place, made by turning the Leaves of
the Bible; nay, if a blind Body be at the Church,
they will have a Bible, which they will give to the
Per&s;ons next to them to fold down the Texts quo|ted,
that they may cau&s;e &s;ome Body to read them
to them when they come home.</P>
<P><PB N="333" REF="435">
There are many more Circum&s;tances, in which
I might &s;how the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> to be happi|ly
di&s;tingui&s;h'd from mo&s;t, if not all the other
Prote&s;tant Churches in <HI>Europe,</HI> but the Particulars
are too many.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h I could have had Room in the&s;e Memoirs
to have &s;et down the Heads of their Discipline,
which we call an <HI>England</HI> the Canon, but it is too
long; what has been &s;aid, as it is impartially &s;in|cere,
&s;o tho' &s;hort in Particulars, is &s;ufficient to
let you know what a Church &s;he is, and what a
Flourishing and Glorious State &s;he is now in.
The Glory be to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Eternal King

<HEAD>APPENDIX
OF THE
STATE
OF THE
CHURCH
SINCE THE
UNION</HEAD>
<P>_AS the&s;e Memoirs were Written &s;oon
after the Union between <HI>England</HI>
and <HI>Scotland</HI> was fini&s;h'd and rati|fy'd,
&s;o the Period cho&s;en for the
la&s;t Part was proper to the Time;
but no le&s;s than Nine Years having
pa&s;t &s;ince that Time, and before the Publication
here of, it is requisite that &s;ome Notice &s;hould
be taken of what has happen'd in that Time, and
this the rather, becau&s;e &s;ome Depredations have
<PB REF="437">
been made upon the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Liberties of the
Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;ince that Time, and &s;ome
Attempts, even be&s;ides the open Rebellion of the
Jacobites, in Order, if po&s;&s;ible, to pull down her
Fences, and lay open her Enclo&s;ure; that <HI>Jacob</HI>
might be given to the Spoil, and <HI>I&s;rael</HI> to the
Robber.</P>
<P>But that Providence which has &s;o eminently
guarded the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> in &s;o many Dan|gers,
has deliver'd her from this al&s;o, and now
&s;he &s;ees her &s;elf free again from farther Inva&s;ion.</P>
<P>We have &s;een in the Accounts pa&s;s'd, on what
Foot of E&s;tabli&s;hment the Church &s;tood &s;oon after
the Revolution, and how &s;he went, even till the
Treaty of Union neither is there any Thing in
her Hi&s;tory, which requires particular Notice du|ring
that interval of Time. Farther 'tis ob&s;er|vable,
that the Church being effectually re&s;tor'd <HI>as
before,</HI> and enjoying an uninterrupted Pro&s;perity;
there remain'd nothing to be done in her Behalf,
at the Time of the <HI>Treaty of &V;nion,</HI> but to pre&s;erve
her as &s;he was in the full Enjoyment and <HI>Security</HI> of
her Doctrine, Di&s;cipline Wor&s;hip and Govern|ment.</P>
<P>For this Rea&s;on, when the Treaty began, it was
laid down as a Fundamental, <HI>That the Commi&s;&s;ioners
on either Side &s;hould have no Power to enter into any Con|ferences
upon the Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Settlement of either Na|tion,</HI>
for as where was no View or De&s;ign, or indeed
po&s;&s;bility of bringing the Two Churches to unite:
So to agree at fir&s;t, that both &s;hould remain <HI>just
at they were,</HI> was the only Method to put the Trea|ty
in a way of being fini&s;h'd: The want of &s;uch a
Preliminary having been the only Rea&s;on why all
other Attempts for a Union had proved ineffectual
and come to nothing.</P>
<P><PB REF="438">
The Church then having no room to apprehend
that her Con&s;titution &s;hould come to be debated
in this Treaty, had nothing left to do, but to
bring her Security to be one of the Articles of the
Union, and &s;o bring the Epi&s;copal Church of <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
not only to Recognize her E&s;tabli&s;hment, but
to engage the whole Nation and Power of <HI>England</HI>
to &s;upport and maintain it.</P>
<P>And this alone made the <HI>&V;nion</HI> be acknowledg|ed
to be &s;erviceable to the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> for
otherwise it mu&s;t be allow'd, that it had been a
dangerous Thing for the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which
was the weaker, to join and incorporate her Civil
Power, which was her Defence, with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI>
which was the &s;tronger: But now the Security,
Liberty and E&s;tabli&s;hment of the Church of <HI>Scot|land</HI>
being twi&s;ted with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution,
and built upon the &s;ame Foundation with that of
the Church of <HI>England</HI> it becomes invulnerable,
unle&s;s we &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e the whole Eccle&s;ia&s;tic and
Civil Con&s;titution of <HI>Great Britain</HI> &s;hould &s;uffer a
Convul&s;ion, and be overturn'd and de&s;troy'd.</P>
<P>Nor had the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;o good a Se|curity
for her E&s;tabli&s;hment before; her Nobility
and Repre&s;entatives, being not the be&s;t Friends to
her Con&s;titution, often offended at the Severity of
her Di&s;cipline, and in part debauch'd from her
Principles by the Levity and Fa&s;hion of the Court;
and it was more than probable, that in time they
night have given a Blow to the Constitution of the
Church, which now it is for ever out of their
Power to do.</P>
<P>It is true, that there is not one Ounce of <HI>Good
Will</HI> the more between the Two Churches for this
Union, nor can I lay that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Church has
not &s;hewn her Teeth on &s;everal Occa&s;ions &s;ince
that: The <HI>Scots</HI> Epi&s;copal Clergy have met with
<PB REF="439">
Encouragement in their in&s;ulting the Church, of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> as in the Ca&s;e of Mr. <HI>Green&s;hields,</HI> who
let up a Meeting-Hou&s;e in the Teeth of the Ma|gi&s;trates
of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and vilely in&s;ulted them when
they touch'd him on that Head, telling them he
was a Member of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and ap|pealing
from them to the Hou&s;e of Lords.</P>
<P>But after all, as the Government were convin|ced,
that the Epi&s;copal Men were in the Wrong,
and that they could not &s;upport the De&s;ign; &s;o
the Man had &s;ome Money given him to withdraw,
and the Ca&s;e was dropt as quietly as they could,
and with, that ju&s;t Caution with which wi&s;e Men
generally drop a Thing they are a&s;hamed of.</P>
<P>Nor can I &s;ay, that even the Union it &s;elf has
been &s;o &s;acredly ob&s;erv'd on the <HI>Engli&s;h Side,</HI> as
the Ca&s;e of the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> required, or her
Privileges &s;o well pre&s;erv'd as they had Rea&s;on to
expect, from the good Words which were given
them at the time of the Treaty; Witne&s;s the &s;e|veral
Attacks made upon them in the Affair of
Patronages, the Yule Vacance, and the impo&s;ing
Oaths upon the Mini&s;ters, incon&s;i&s;tent with their
principles; Things of which all I &s;hall now &s;ay, is,
That as they were done in a Reign, which did
&s;everal other Things which the pre&s;ent Reign di|&s;owns
and declares; again&s;t &s;o we have great room
to hope, and the Church of Scotland to expect,
that tho&s;e Impo&s;itions and Infractions of the Trea|ty
will be repealed, and that &s;he &s;hall have
more Ju&s;tice for the future.</P>
<P>The Church made what &s;truggle they could at
that Time again&s;t the pa&s;&s;ing the Bill for re&s;toring
Lay-Patrouages; the Agents they employ'd here
were heard by their Council, and con&s;idering how
much was &s;aid again&s;t it, and how little was, or
could be &s;aid for it, 'twas thought very unaccount|able
<PB REF="440">
that &s;uch an Act &s;hould pa&s;s at all; but it mu&s;t
be placed to the Account of the Times, and who
ever reflects upon the Per&s;ons who manag'd the
Affairs of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and had the Power at that
Juncture, will find the Nece&s;&s;ity they were in of
gratifying the Epi&s;copal Party: Their Advocate
then was the Earl of <HI>Marr,</HI> the &s;ame who has
been &s;ince their Champion, and who was then
Secretary of State, it was no wonder then that the
Church had as little favour in every thing that
was mov'd again&s;t her, or wherein her Intere&s;t was
concern'd, as if &s;he had been an Enemy; nor was
it in the Power of the few Gentlemen in <HI>England,</HI>
who were &s;en&s;ible of the Injury, and would have
&s;erv'd her at that Time, to do any Thing for her.</P>
<P>However, a long Defence of her Privileges was
publi&s;hed and delivered to the Members of Parlia|ment,
and was hand&s;omely &s;poken to in the
Hou&s;e; and the Church had this Satisfaction, that
her Cau&s;e was lo&s;t by Numbers, not by Strength
of Rea&s;oning, or of Right.</P>
<P>It would be too long to incert here the tedious
Account publi&s;h'd on that Occasion, by &s;ome who
&s;hew'd their good Will, rather than Capacity to
State the Ca&s;e: But the true State of the Ca&s;e, as
it was presented to the Hou&s;e of Lords by the Three
Ministers deputed by the Church for that Purpo&s;e,
cannot but be proper to pubi&s;h, becau&s;e it gives
the Churches Plea in her own Words, and is as fol|lows.</P>
<DIV2>
<PB REF="441">
<HEAD>To the Right Honourable the Lords Spiritual and Tempo|ral
in Parliament A&s;&s;embled. The Humble Repre&s;en|tation
of William Car&s;tairs, Thomas Blackwell
and Robert Baillie, Mini&s;ters of the Church of
SCOTLAND, concerning the Bill for re&s;toring Patro|nages,
now depending before your Lord&s;hips.</HEAD>
<P>IT is with all humble Duty and Submi&s;&s;ion re|pre&s;ented
unto your Lord&s;hips, that this de|pending
Bill &s;eems to be contrary to the pre&s;ent
Con&s;titution of our Church, &s;o well &s;ecured by
the late Treaty of Union, and &s;olemnly ratified
by the Acts of Parliament in both Kingdoms: That
this may be more clear, it is to be ob&s;erv'd, That
from, the fir&s;t Reformation from Popery, the Church
of <HI>Scotland</HI> hath always reckon'd Patronages a Grie|vance
and Burden, as is declared by the fir&s;t and
&s;econd Books of Di&s;cipline, publi&s;h'd &s;oon af|ter
the &s;aid Reformation, &s;ince which Time they
were &s;till judged a Grievance, till at length they
came by Law to be aboli&s;hed.</P>
<P>The&s;e Patronages having been re&s;tor'd with
Epi&s;copacy, in the Year 1661, and 1662; did
continue to the Year 1690, that Epi&s;copacy was
aboli&s;h'd, and Presbyterian Government again e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd;
and tho' the Act of Parliament 1690,
re&s;ettling Presbyterian Church Government, was
founded upon the Act of Parliament 1592, which
bears a Relation unto Patronages, yet the &s;aid Act
of Parliament 1690, doth expre&s;ly except that
Part of the old Act, and refer Patronages to be
thereafter con&s;ider'd, which accordingly was con|&s;ider'd
in the &s;ame Parliament 1690, whereby it is
plain, that the Abolition of Patronages was made
a Part of our Church Con&s;titution, enacted by the
Act 1690, and that this Act 1690, with all other
Acts relative thereto being expre&s;ly ratified, and
<PB REF="442">
for ever confirm'd by the Act for &s;ecuring the
Prote&s;tan Religion and Presbyterian Government,
and Ingro&s;s'd as an e&s;&s;ential Condition of the Rati|fications
of the Treaty of Union pa&s;t in the Par|liaments
of both Kingdoms, The &s;aid Act aboli&s;h|ing
Patronages mu&s;t be under&s;tood to be a Part
of our Presbyterian Con&s;titution &s;ecur'd to us by
the Treaty of Union for ever.</P>
<P>Yet it is to be particularly con&s;ider'd, that the
&s;ame Parliament 1690, was &s;o tender of the civil
Rights of Patrons, and &s;o &s;incerely de&s;irous only
to re&s;tore the Church to its ju&s;t und primitive Li|berty
of calling Mini&s;ters in a Way agreeable to
the Word of God, that they only di&s;charged the
Patrons Power of Pre&s;enting Mini&s;ters to vacant
Churches, but as to any thing of their civil Rights,
did make the Condition of Patrons better than
before, not only by re&s;erving unto them the Right
of Di&s;po&s;al of vacant Stipends, for pious U&s;es
within the Paroch, but al&s;o for giving unto them
the heretable Rights of the Tythes, re&s;tricting
the Mini&s;ter, who formerly had the &s;aid Right to
Stipends, much below the Value of the &s;aid Tythes,
notwith&s;tanding which advantageous Conce&s;&s;ion to
the Patrons by the Parliament, this Bill takes
back from the Church the Power of Presentation
of Mini&s;ters, without re&s;toring the Tythes which
formerly belong'd to her, hy which the Parons
come to enjoy both the Purcha&s;e and the Price.</P>
<P>This being then the true Account of our legal
Settlement as to this Matter, it appears to be evi|dent
that the Re&s;titution of Patronages, as to the
Point of Pre&s;entation, can only gratify a few, while
on the other Hand it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily di&s;oblige a
far greater Number, that are now freed of that
Impo&s;ition, and indeed it cannot but &s;eem &s;trange,
that this Bill &s;hould be &s;o much in&s;i&s;ted upon,
<PB REF="443">
when there are &s;o many Patrons, and tho&s;e too of
the mo&s;t considerable in <HI>Scotland,</HI> that are again&s;t
&s;uch a Re&s;titution.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o apparent, that Presbyteries mu&s;t come
under many Difficulties and Hard&s;hips, as to their
Compliance with this Innovation, and that many
Conte&s;ts, Di&s;orders and Differences, will probably
in&s;ue betwixt patrons, Presbyters, Heretors and
People, be&s;ides the known Abu&s;es wherewith Pa|tronages
have been attended even in their mo&s;t
&s;ettled Condition; whereof many In&s;tances might
be given; e&s;pecially, that thereby a Foundation
was &s;aid for Simoniacal Factions, betwixt Patrons
and, tho&s;e pre&s;ented by them, and likewi&s;e Mini|&s;ters
were impo&s;ed upon Paroches by Patrons who
were utterly Strangers to their Circum&s;tances, ha|ving
neither Property nor Re&s;idence therein.</P>
<Q>It is therefore with all Submi&s;&s;ion expected from
your Lord&s;hips Ju&s;tice and mature Deliberation,
That a Bill, as we humbly conceive, &s;o nearly af|fecting
the late Treaty of &V;nion in one of its mo&s;t
Fundamental and E&s;&s;ential Articles, re&s;pecting the
Pre&s;ervation of the Rights and Privileges, which
our Church at that Time was po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of by Law,
for the Security of which the Parliament of Scot|land
was &s;o much concern'd as not to allow their
Commi&s;&s;ioners to make it any Part of their Treaty,
but re&s;erved it as a Thing unalterable by any Judi|cature
deriving its Con&s;titution from the &s;aid
Treaty, &s;hall not be approv'd by Your Lord&s;hips,
e&s;pecially while the Nature of the Treaty it &s;elf
&s;hews it to be a reciprocal Tran&s;action between the
Two Nations.</Q>

<PB REF="444">
<P>Before the Commons, as have &s;aid, they
Were heard by Council; but all wag to no Purpo&s;e,
the Bill pa&s;s'd; and which is wor&s;e, we do not &s;ee
the Church of <HI>England,</HI> or even the Gentlemen
in the Parliament of <HI>Britain,</HI> who were actually a|gain&s;t
the Bill at that time, equally &s;olicitous to
re&s;tore the Church now to the Privileges which
&s;he lo&s;t then, how unju&s;t &s;oever the taking them
away has been.</P>
<P>Indeed we find the Commi&s;&s;ion of the A&s;&s;embly
very earne&s;t to &s;olicit the redre&s;s of tho&s;e Grie|vances,
and not without Hope that it &s;hall be ef|fected:
And therefore, even while this was wri|ting,
Two Mini&s;ters, <HI>viz.</HI> Mr.&mdash;<HI>Hamilton,</HI> Pro|fe&s;&s;or
of Divinity in the College of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and
Mr. <HI>William Mitchel,</HI> one of the Mini&s;ters of <HI>Edin|burgh,</HI>
are Deputed by the &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ion to at|tend
the fitting of the approaching Parliament, to
get, if po&s;&s;ible, Redre&s;s of the Churches Grie|vances,
and a Repeal of tho&s;e Acts which pa&s;s'd
in the preceding Reign in their Prejudice: The
Acts are particularly.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Act for re&s;toring Patronages.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Act for Tollerating Epi&s;copal Meet|ings.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The Act for the <HI>Yule</HI> Vacance; that is, for
keeping <HI>Chri&s;tmas.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>If tho&s;e Three are obtain'd, the Church will
then be re&s;tor'd to her full Lu&s;tre and Authority,
end its hoped will never more have any Occa&s;ion
to Complain of being Oppre&s;s'd.</P>
