<P>THE compunction of Richard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. X.</NOTE> for his unduti|ful
behaviour towards his father,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1189.</NOTE> was very du|rable,
and influenced him in the choice of his
mini&s;ters and &s;ervants after his acce&s;&s;ion. Tho&s;e who
had &s;econded and favoured his rebellion, in&s;tead of meet|ing
with that honour and tru&s;t which they expected,
were &s;urpri&s;ed to find, that they lay under di&s;grace with
the new King, and were on all occa&s;ions hated and de|&s;pi&s;ed
<PB N="2" REF="5">
by him. The faithful mini&s;ters of Henry, who had
vigorou&s;ly oppo&s;ed all the enterprizes of his &s;ons, were
received with open arms, and were continued in tho&s;e
employments, which they had honourably di&s;charged to
their former ma&s;ter<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 655. Bened. Abb. p. 547. M. Paris, p. 107.</NOTE>. This prudent conduct might be
the re&s;ult of reflection; but in a prince, like Richard, &s;o
much guided by pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;o little by policy, it was
commonly a&s;cribed to a principle &s;till more virtuous and
more honourable.</P>
<P>RICHARD, that he might make atonement to one
parent for his breach of duty to the other, immediately
&s;ent orders for relea&s;ing the Queen-dowager from the con|finement
in which &s;he had been &s;o long detained<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ben. Abb. p. 549. M. Paris, p. 107. Trivet, p. 97. Diceto, p. 646. Gerva&s;e, p. 1547.</NOTE>; and
he entru&s;ted her with the government of England, till
his arrival in that kingdom. His bounty to his brother
John was rather profu&s;e and imprudent. Be&s;ides be&s;tow|ing
on him the county of Mortaigne in Normandy,
granting him a pen&s;ion of four thou&s;and marks a-year,
and marrying him to Avi&s;a, the daughter of the earl of
Gloce&s;ter, by whom he inherited all the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of that
opulent family; he increa&s;ed this appanage, which the
late King had de&s;tined him, by other exten&s;ive grants
and conce&s;&s;ions. He conferred on him the whole e&s;tate
of William Peverell, which had e&s;cheated to the crown:
He put him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of eight ca&s;tles, with all the
fore&s;ts and honours annexed to them<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 107.</NOTE>: He delivered
over to him no le&s;s than &s;ix earldoms, Cornwal, Devon,
Somer&s;et, Nottingham, Dor&s;et, Lanca&s;ter and Derby<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 645. Bened. Abb. p. 555, 577. W. Homing. p. 518, Bromp|ton, p. 1178. Knyghton, p. 2401.</NOTE>.
And endeavouring, by favours, to fix that vicious prince
in his duty, he put it too much in his power, whenever
he plea&s;ed, to depart from it.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="6">
THE King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's preparation for the cru|&s;ade.</NOTE> impelled more by the love of military
glory than by &s;uper&s;tition, acted, from the beginning of
his reign, as if the &s;ole purpo&s;e of his government had
been the relief of the holy land, and the recovery of Je|ru&s;alem
from the Saracens. This zeal again&s;t infidels,
being communicated to his &s;ubjects, broke out in London
on the day of his coronation, and made them find a cru|&s;ade
le&s;s dangerous, and attended with more immediate
profit. The prejudices of the age had made the lending
of money on intere&s;t pa&s;s by the invidious name of u&s;ury;
yet the nece&s;&s;ity of the practice had &s;till continued it,
and the greate&s;t part of that kind of dealing fell every
where into the hands of the Jews; who, being already
infamous on account of their religion, had no honour
to lo&s;e, and were apt to exerci&s;e a profe&s;&s;ion, odious in
it&s;elf, by every kind of rigor, and even &s;ometimes by ra|pine
and extortion. The indu&s;try and frugality of that
people had put them in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the ready money,
which the idlene&s;s and profu&s;ion of the Engli&s;h, as well as
of other European nations, enabled them to lend on
exorbitant and unequal intere&s;t. The monki&s;h writers
repre&s;ent it as a great &s;tain on the wi&s;e and equitable go|vernment
of Henry, that he had carefully protected this
infidel race from all injuries and in&s;ults; but the zeal of
Richard afforded the populace a pretence for exerci&s;ing
their animo&s;ity again&s;t them. The King had i&s;&s;ued a
proclamation, prohibiting their appearance at his corona|tion;
but &s;ome of them, bringing him large pre&s;ents
from their nation, pre&s;umed, in confidence of that merit,
to approach the hall in which he dined; and being di&s;|covered,
they were expo&s;ed to the in&s;ults and injuries of the by&s;tanders<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 657. Bened. Abb. p. 560. M. Paris, p. 108. Brompton, p. 1156. Knyghton, p. 2401.</NOTE>. They took to flight; the people pur|&s;ued
them; the rumor was &s;pread, that the King had
<PB N="4" REF="7">
given orders to ma&s;&s;acre all the Jews; a command &s;o a|greeable
was executed in an in&s;tant on &s;uch as fell into
the hands of the populace; tho&s;e who had kept at home
were expo&s;ed to equal danger; the people, moved by ra|pacity
and zeal, broke into their hou&s;es, which they
plundered, after having murdered the owners; where the
Jews barricadoed their doors, and defended them&s;elves
with vigour, the rabble &s;et fire to the hou&s;es, and made
way thro' the flames to exerci&s;e their pillage and vi|olence
<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ann. Waverl. p. 163. Knyghton, p. 2401.</NOTE>; the u&s;ual licentiou&s;ne&s;s of London, which the &s;overeign power with difficulty re&s;trained, broke out with
fury, and continued the&s;e outrages; the hou&s;es of the
rich citizens, tho' Chri&s;tians, were next attacked and
plundered<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 657. Bened. Abb. p. 560. M. Paris, p. 108. W. Heming. p. 514.</NOTE>; and wearine&s;s and &s;atiety at la&s;t put an end
to the di&s;order: Yet when the King impowered Glanville,
the ju&s;ticiary, to inquire into the authors of the&s;e crimes,
the guilt was found to involve &s;o many of the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable
inhabitants, that it was deemed more prudent
to drop the pro&s;ecution; and very few &s;uffered the pu|ni&s;hment
due to this enormity<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Diceto, p. 647. Knyghton, p. 2401.</NOTE>. But the di&s;order &s;top|ped
not at London. The inhabitants of the other cities
of England, hearing of this execution of the Jews, imi|tated
the barbarous example<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Chron. de Dun&s;t. p. 43. Wykes, p. 34. W. Heming. p. 516. Diceto, p 651.</NOTE>; and in York, five hundred
of that nation, who had retired into the ca&s;tle for &s;afety,
and found them&s;elves unable to defend the place, mur|dered
their own wives and children, threw the dead bo|dies
over the walls upon the populace, and then &s;etting
$ire to the hou&s;es, peri&s;hed in the flames<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 665. Bened. Abb. p. 586. M. Paris, p. 111.</NOTE>. The gentry
of the neighbourhood, who were all indebted to the
<PB N="5" REF="8">
Jews, ran to the cathedral, where their bonds were kept,
and made a &s;olemn bonefire of the papers before the altar<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">W. Heming. p. 518.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE antient &s;ituation of England, when the people
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed little riches and the public no credit, made it
impo&s;&s;ible for the &s;overeigns to bear the expences of a
&s;teady or durable war, even on their frontiers; much le&s;s
could they find regular means for the &s;upport of &s;uch
di&s;tant expeditions as tho&s;e into Pale&s;tine, which were
more the re&s;ult of popular frenzy than of &s;ober rea&s;on or
deliberate policy. Richard, therefore, knew, that he mu&s;t
carry with him all the trea&s;ure requi&s;ite for his enterprize,
and that both the remotene&s;s of his own country and its
poverty made it unable to furni&s;h him with tho&s;e con|tinued
&s;upplies, which the exigencies of &s;o perilous a war
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily require. His father had left him a trea|&s;ure
of above an hundred thou&s;and marks<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 656.</NOTE>; and the
King, negligent of every intere&s;t, but that of pre&s;ent
glory, endeavoured to augment this &s;um by all expedi|ents,
however pernicious to the public, or dangerous to
royal authority<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 568.</NOTE>: He put to &s;ale the revenues and ma|nors
of the crown; the offices of greate&s;t tru&s;t and
power, even tho&s;e of fore&s;ter and &s;heriff, which antiently
were &s;o important<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">The &s;heriff had antiently both the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice and the management of the King's revenue committed to him in the county. <HI>See Hale of Sheriffs Accounts.</HI></NOTE>, became venal; the dignity of chief
ju&s;ticiary, in who&s;e hands was lodged the whole execu|tion
of the laws, was &s;old to Hugh de Puzas, bi&s;hop of
Durham, for a thou&s;and marks; the &s;ame prelate bought
the earldom of Northumberland for his life<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 109.</NOTE>; many of
the champions of the cro&s;s, who had repented of their
vow, purcha&s;ed the liberty of violating it; and Richard,
who &s;tood le&s;s in need of men than money, readily, on
<PB N="6" REF="9">
the&s;e conditions, di&s;pen&s;ed with their attendance. Elated
with the hopes of fame, which in that age attended no
wars but tho&s;e again&s;t the infidels, he was blind to every
other con&s;ideration; and when &s;ome of his wi&s;er mi|ni&s;ters
objected again&s;t this di&s;&s;ipation of the revenue and
power of the crown, he replied, that he would &s;ell Lon|don
it&s;elf if he could find a purcha&s;er<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">W. Heming. p. 519. Knyghton, p. 2402.</NOTE>. Nothing in|deed
could be a &s;tronger proof how negligent he was of
all future intere&s;ts in compari&s;on of the cru&s;ade, than his
&s;elling, for &s;o &s;mall a &s;um as 10,000 marks, the va&s;&s;alage
of Scotland, together with the fortre&s;&s;es of Roxborough
and Berwic, the greate&s;t acqui&s;ition which had been made
by his father during the cour&s;e of his victorious reign;
and his accepting the homage of William in the u&s;ual
terms, merely for the territories which that prince held
in England<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 662. Rymer, vol. i. p. 64. M. We&s;t. p. 257.</NOTE>. Numerous exactions were practi&s;ed on
the Engli&s;h of all ranks and &s;tations: Menaces were em|ployed
both again&s;t the innocent and the guilty, in order
to force money from them: And where a pretence was
wanting again&s;t the rich, the King obliged them, by
the fear of his di&s;plea&s;ure, to lend him &s;ums, which, he
knew, it would never be in his power to repay.</P>
<P>BUT Richard, tho' he &s;acrificed every intere&s;t and
con&s;ideration to the &s;ucce&s;s of this pious enterprize, car|ried
&s;o little the appearance of &s;anctity in his conduct,
that Fulk, curate of Neuilly, a zealous preacher of the
cru&s;ade, who from that merit had acquired the privi|lege
of &s;peaking the bolde&s;t truths, advi&s;ed him to rid
him&s;elf of his notorious vices, particularly his pride, ava|rice,
and voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, which he called the King's
three favourite daughters. <HI>You coun&s;el well,</HI> replied
Richard; <HI>and I hereby di&s;po&s;e of the fir&s;t to the Templars, of
the &s;econd to the Benedictines, and of the third to my prelates.</HI></P>
<P>RICHARD, jealous of attempts which might be made
<PB N="7" REF="10">
on England during his ab&s;ence, laid prince John, as
well as his natural brother Geoffrey, archbi&s;hop of York,
under engagements, confirmed by their oaths, that nei|ther
of them &s;hould enter that kingdom till his return;
tho' he thought proper, before his departure, to withdraw
this prohibition<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 664. Bened. Abb. p. 584. Brompton, p. 1171.</NOTE>. The admini&s;tration was left in the
hands of Hugh, bi&s;hop of Durham, and of Longchamp,
bi&s;hop of Ely, whom he appointed ju&s;ticiaries and guar|dians
of the realm<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 663. Bened. Abb. p. 584. M. Paris, p. 110.</NOTE>. The latter was a Norman of mean
birth, and of a violent character; who by art and addre&s;s
had in&s;inuated him&s;elf into favour, whom Richard had
created chancellor, and whom he had engaged the Pope
al&s;o to inve&s;t with the legatine authority, that, by cen|tering
every kind of power in his per&s;on, he might the
better en&s;ure the public tranquillity<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 665. 702. Bened. Abb p. 585.</NOTE>. All the military
and turbulent &s;pirits flocked about the per&s;on of the
King, and were impatient to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves a|gain&s;t
the infidels in A&s;ia; whither his inclinations, his
engagements, led him, and whither he was impelled by
me&s;&s;ages from the King of France, ready to embark in
this enterprize<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 109. Diceto, p. 649. Rymer, vol. i. p. 63.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Emperor Frederic, a prince of great &s;pirit and
conduct, had already taken the road to Pale&s;tine at the
head of 150,000 men, collected from Germany and all
the northern &s;tates; and having &s;urmounted every ob|&s;tacle
thrown in his way by the artifices of the Greeks
and the power of the infidels, had penetrated to the
borders of Syria; when, bathing in the cold river
Cydnus, during the greate&s;t heat of the &s;ummer-&s;ea&s;on,
he was &s;eized with a mortal di&s;temper,
which put an end to his life and his ra&s;h enter|prize
<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 556.</NOTE>. His army, under the command of his &s;on Con|rade,
<PB N="8" REF="11">
reached Pale&s;tine; but was &s;o dimini&s;hed by fatigue,
famine, maladies, and the &s;word, that it &s;carce amounted
to eight thou&s;and men; and was in&s;ufficient to make
any progre&s;s again&s;t the great power, valour, and con|duct
of Saladin. The&s;e reiterated calamities, attending
the cru&s;ades, had taught the Kings of France and Eng|land
the nece&s;&s;ity of trying another road to the holy
land; and they determined to conduct their armies thither
by &s;ea, to carry provi&s;ions along with them, and by means
of their naval power to maintain an open communication
with their own &s;tates, and with the we&s;tern parts of Eu|rope.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1190.</NOTE>
The fir&s;t place of rendezvous was appointed in
the plains of Vezelay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">29th June.</NOTE> on the borders of Burgundy<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 660.</NOTE>;
and Philip and Richard, on their arrival there, found
their armies amount to 100,000 men<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Vini&s;auf, p. 305.</NOTE>; an invincible
force, animated with glory and religion, conducted by
two warlike monarchs, provided with every thing which
their &s;everal dominions could afford, and not to be over|come
but by their own mi&s;conduct, or by the un&s;ur|mountable
ob&s;tacles of nature.</P>
<P>THE French prince and the Engli&s;h here reiterated
their promi&s;es of mutual friend&s;hip,<NOTE PLACE="marg">King &s;ets out on the cru&s;ade.</NOTE> pledged their
faith not to invade each other's dominions during
the cru&s;ade, exchanged the oaths of all their barons and

the penalty of interdicts and excommunications, if they

which proved fatal to their enterprize.</P>
<P>RICHARD and Philip were, by the &s;ituation and ex|tent
of their dominions, rivals in power; by their age
and inclinations, competitors for glory; and the&s;e cau&s;es
of emulation, which, had the princes been employed in
the field again&s;t the common enemy, might have &s;timu|lated
them to martial enterprizes, &s;oon excited, during
the pre&s;ent lei&s;ure and repo&s;e, quarrels between monarchs
of &s;uch a fiery character. Equally haughty, ambitious,
intrepid, and inflexible; they were irritated with the lea&s;t
appearance of injury, and were incapable, by mutual
conde&s;cen&s;ions, to efface tho&s;e cau&s;es of complaint, which
unavoidably aro&s;e between them. Richard, candid, &s;in|cere,
unde&s;igning, impolitic, violent, laid him&s;elf open,
on every occa&s;ion, to the de&s;igns of his antagoni&s;t; who,
provident, intere&s;ted, deceitful, failed not to take all ad|vantages
against him: And thus, both the circum&s;tan|ces
of their di&s;po&s;ition in which they were &s;imilar, and
tho&s;e in which they differed, rendered it impo&s;&s;ible for
them to per&s;evere in that harmony, which was &s;o e&s;&s;en|tial
to the &s;ucce&s;s of their undertaking.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t King of Sicily and Naples was William II.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tr$n&s;ac|ti$s in Si|cily.</NOTE>
who had married Joan, &s;i&s;ter to Richard, and who, dy|ing

&s;urviving of Roger, the fir&s;t &s;overeign of tho&s;e &s;tates who
had been honoured with the royal title. This paince&s;s
had, in expectation of that rich inheritance, been mar|ried

barons, that, taking advantage of Henry's ab&s;ence,
he had acquired po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne, and main|tained
his claim, by force of arms, again&s;t all the efforts
of the Germans<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 663.</NOTE>. The approach of the cru&s;aders natu|rally
gave him apprehen&s;ions for his un&s;table government;
and he was uncertain, whether he had mo&s;t rea&s;on to
dread the pre&s;ence of the French or of the Engli&s;h mo|narch.
Philip was engaged in &s;trict alliance with the
Emperor, his competitor: Richard was di&s;gu&s;ted by his ri|gors
towards the Queen-dowager, whom the Sicilian
prince had confined in Palermo; becau&s;e &s;he had oppo&s;ed
with all her intere&s;t his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown. Tan|cred,
therefore, &s;en&s;ible of the pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ity, re&s;olved
to pay court to both the&s;e formidable princes; and he was
not un&s;ucce&s;sful in his endeavours. He per&s;uaded Philip
that it was highly improper for him to interrupt his enter|prize
again&s;t the infidels, by any attempt again&s;t a Chri&s;|tian
prince: He re&s;tored Queen Joan to her liberty; and
even found means to make an alliance with Richard,
who &s;tipulated by treaty to marry his nephew, Arthur,
the young duke of Brittany, to one of the daughters of
Tancred<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 676, 677. Bened. Abb. p. 615.</NOTE>. But before the&s;e terms of friend&s;hip were
agreed on, Richard, jealous both of Tancred and of the
inhabitants of Me&s;&s;ina, had taken up his quarters in the
&s;uburbs, and had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of a &s;mall fort, which
commanded the harbour; and he remained extremely on
his guard again&s;t their enterprizes. The citizens took
umbrage: Mutual in&s;ults and attacks pa&s;&s;ed between them
and the Engli&s;h:<NOTE PLACE="marg">3d October.</NOTE> Philip, who had quartered his troops
in the town, endeavoured to accommodate the quarrel, and
held a conference with Richard for that purpo&s;e. While
the two Kings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th Octo|ber.</NOTE> meeting in the open fields, were engaged
in di&s;cour&s;e on this &s;ubject, a body of the&s;e Sicilians
<PB N="11" REF="16">
&s;eemed to be drawing towards them; and Richard pu&s;hed
forwards, in order to inquire into the rea&s;on of this ex|traordinary
movement<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 608.</NOTE>. The Engli&s;h, in&s;olent from
their power, and inflamed with former animo&s;ities, want|ed
but a pretence for attacking the Me&s;&s;ine&s;e; and
they &s;oon chaced them from the field, drove them into
the town, and entered with them at the gates. The
King employed his authority to re&s;train them from pil|laging
and ma&s;&s;acring the defencele&s;s inhabitants; but
he gave orders, in token of his victory, that the &s;tandard
of England &s;hould be erected on the walls. Philip, who
con&s;idered that place as his quarters, exclaimed again&s;t the in&s;ult,
and ordered &s;ome of his troops to pull down
the &s;tandard: But Richard informed him by a me&s;&s;enger,
that tho' he him&s;elf would willingly remove that ground
of offence, he would not permit it to be done by others;
and if the French King attempted &s;uch an in&s;ult upon
him, he &s;hould not &s;ucceed but by the utmo&s;t effu&s;ion of
blood. Philip, contented with this &s;pecies of haughty
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, recalled his orders<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 674.</NOTE>: The difference was
&s;eemingly accommodated; but left &s;till the remains of
rancour and jealou&s;y in the brea&s;t of the two monarchs.</P>
<P>TANCRED,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1191.</NOTE> who, for his own &s;ecurity, de&s;ired to in|flame
their mutual hatred, practi&s;ed an artifice, which
might have been attended with con&s;equences &s;till more
fatal. He &s;howed Richard a letter, &s;igned by the French
King, and delivered him, as he pretended, by the duke
of Burgundy; in which that monarch de&s;ired Tancred
to fall upon the quarters of the Engli&s;h, and promi&s;ed to
a&s;&s;i&s;t him in putting them to the &s;word, as common ene|mies.
The unwary Richard gave credit to the infor|mation;
but was too candid not to betray his di&s;content
to Philip, who ab&s;olutely denied the letter, and charged
<PB N="12" REF="17">
the Sicilian prince with forgery and fal&s;ehood. Richard
either was, or pretended to be, entirely &s;atisfied<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 688. Bened. Abb. p. 642, 643. Brompton, p. 1195.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>LEST the&s;e jealou&s;ies and complaints &s;hould multiply
between them, it was propo&s;ed, that, by a &s;olemn treaty,
they &s;hould cut off the root of all future differences, and
adju&s;t every point which could po&s;&s;ibly hereafter become
a controver&s;y between them. But this expedient &s;tarted
a new di&s;pute, which might have proved more dangerous
than any of the foregoing, and which deeply concerned
the honour of Philip's family. When Richard, in every
treaty with Henry II. in&s;i&s;ted &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly on being al|lowed
to marry Alice of France, he had only &s;ought a
pretence for quarrelling; and never meant to take into
his bed a prince&s;s &s;u&s;pected of a criminal amour with his
own father. After he became ma&s;ter, he no longer talked
of compleating that alliance: He even took mea&s;ures for
e&s;pou&s;ing Berengaria, daughter of Sanchez, King of
Navarre, with whom he had become enamoured during
his abode in Guienne<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Vini&s;auf, p. 316.</NOTE>: Queen Eleanor was daily ex|pected
with that prince&s;s at Me&s;&s;ina<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 112. Trivet, p. 102. W. Heming. p. 519.</NOTE>: And when Philip
renewed to him his applications for e&s;pou&s;ing his &s;i&s;ter
Alice, Richard was obliged to give him an ab&s;olute re|fu&s;al.
It is pretended by Hoveden and other hi&s;torians<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 688.</NOTE>,
that he was able to produce &s;uch convincing proofs of
Alice's infidelity, and even of her having born a child to
Henry, that her brother de&s;i&s;ted from his applications,
and cho&s;e to wrap up the di&s;honour of his family in &s;i|lence
and oblivion. It is certain, from the treaty it&s;elf,
which yet remains<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 69. Chron. de Dun&s;t. p. 44.</NOTE>, that, whatever were his motives,
he permitted Richard to give his hand to Berengaria; and
having &s;ettled all other controver&s;ies with that prince, he

immediately &s;et &s;ail for the holy land. Richard awaited
&s;ome time the arrival of his mother and bride; and when
they joined him, he &s;eparated his fleet into two &s;quadrons,
and &s;et forward on his enterprize. Queen Eleanor re|turned
to England; but Berengaria, and the Queen-dowager
of Sicily, his &s;i&s;ter, attended him on the expe|dition<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 644.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Engli&s;h fleet, on leaving the port of Me&s;&s;ina,
met with a furious tempe&s;t; and the &s;quadron, on which
the two prince&s;&s;es were embarked,<NOTE PLACE="marg">12th April.</NOTE> was drove on the
coa&s;t of Cyprus, and &s;ome of the ve&s;&s;els were wrecked
near Limi&s;&s;o in that i&s;land. I&s;aac, prince of Cyprus,
who a&s;&s;umed the magnificent title of Emperor, pillaged
the &s;hips that were &s;tranded, threw the &s;eamen and pa&s;|&s;engers
into pri&s;on, and even refu&s;ed to the prince&s;&s;es li|berty,

of Limi&s;&s;o<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Vini&s;auf, p. 319, 320. W. Heming p. 523.</NOTE>. But Richard, who arrived &s;oon after,
took ample vengeance on him for the injury. He di&s;em|barked
his troops; defeated the tyrant, who oppo&s;ed his
landing; entered Limi&s;&s;o by &s;torm; gained next day a
&s;econd victory; obliged I&s;aac to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion;
and e&s;tabli&s;hed governors over the i&s;land<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 645. Trivet, p. 103.</NOTE>. The Greek
prince, being thrown into pri&s;on and loaded with irons,
complained of the little regard with which he was treated:

<P>THE Engli&s;h army arrived in time to partake in the
glory of the &s;iege of Acre or Ptolemais,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's arrival in Pale&s;tine.</NOTE> which had been
attacked for above two years by the united force of all
the Chri&s;tians in Pale&s;tine, and had been defended by the
utmo&s;t efforts of Saladin and the Saracens. The remains
of the German army, conducted by the Emperor Frede|ric,
and the &s;eparate bodies of adventurers who continu|ally
poured in from the we&s;t, had enabled the King of
Jeru&s;alem to form this important enterprize<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Vini&s;auf, p. 269, 271, 279.</NOTE>: But Sala|din,
having thrown a &s;trong garri&s;on into the place un|der
the command of Caracos<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Diceto, p. 654.</NOTE>, his own ma&s;ter in the
art of war, and mole&s;ting the be&s;iegers with continual
attacks and inroads, had protracted the &s;ucce&s;s of the en|terprize,
and wa&s;ted the force of his enemies. The ar|rival
of Philip and Richard in&s;pired new life into the
Chri&s;tians; and the&s;e princes, acting by concert, and
&s;haring the honour and danger of every action, gave
hopes of a final victory over the infidels. They agreed
on this plan of operations: When the French monarch
attacked the town, the Engli&s;h guarded the trenches:
Next day, when the Engli&s;h prince conducted the a&s;&s;ault,
the French &s;ucceeded him in providing for the &s;afety of
the a&s;&s;ailants. The emulation between the&s;e rival Kings
and rival nations produced extraordinary acts of valour;
and Richard in particular, animated with a more preci|pitate
courage than Philip, and more agreeable to the ro|mantic
&s;pirit of that age, drew to him&s;elf the attention
of all the world, and acquired a great and &s;plendid re|putation.

<P>THE family of Boulogne, which had been fir&s;t placed
on the throne of Jeru&s;alem, ending in a female, Fulk,
count of Anjou, grandfather to Henry II. of England,
married the heire&s;s of that kingdom, and tran&s;mitted his
title to the younger branches of his family. The Anje|vin
race, ending al&s;o in a female, Guy de Lu&s;ignan, by
e&s;pou&s;ing Sibylla, the heire&s;s, had &s;ucceeded to the title;
and tho' he lo&s;t his kingdom by the inva&s;ion of Saladin,
he was &s;till acknowledged by all the Chri&s;tians for King
of Jeru&s;alem<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Vini&s;auf, p. 281.</NOTE>. But as Sibylla died without i&s;&s;ue, during
the &s;iege of Acre, I&s;abella, her younger &s;i&s;ter, put in her
claim to that titular kingdom, and required Lu&s;ignan
to re&s;ign his preten&s;ions to her hu&s;band Conrade, mar|quis
of Mont&s;errat. Lu&s;ignan, maintaining that the
royal title was unalienable and indefeazable, had recour&s;e
to the protection of Richard, attended on him before he
left Cyprus, and engaged him to embrace his cau&s;e<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. 104. Vini&s;auf, p. 342. W. Heming. p. 524.</NOTE>.
There needed no other rea&s;on for throwing Philip into
the party of Conrade; and the oppo&s;ite views of the&s;e
great monarchs brought faction and di&s;&s;en&s;ion into the
Chri&s;tian army, and retarded all its operations<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 693. M. Paris, p. 115. W. Heming. p. 524. Knyghton, p. 2405.</NOTE>. The
Templars, the Genoe&s;e, and the Germans, declared for
Philip and Conrade; the Flemings, the Pi&s;ans, the
knights of the ho&s;pital of St. John, adhered to Richard and
Lu&s;ignan. But notwith&s;tanding the&s;e di&s;putes, as the
$ength of the &s;iege had reduced the Saracen garri&s;on to
the la&s;t extremity, they &s;urrendered them&s;elves pri&s;oners
of war; &s;tipulated, for the &s;aving their lives,<NOTE PLACE="marg">12th July.</NOTE> other ad|vantages

and this great enterprize, which had long engaged the
attention of all Europe and A&s;ia, was at la&s;t, after the
lo&s;s of 300,000 men, brought to a happy period.</P>
<P>BUT Philip, in&s;tead of pur&s;uing the hopes of farther
conque&s;t, and redeeming the holy city from &s;lavery, be|ing
di&s;gu&s;ted with the a&s;cendant a&s;&s;umed and acquired by
Richard, and having views of many advantages, which
he might reap by his pre&s;ence in Europe, declared his re|&s;olution
of returning into France; and he pleaded his
bad &s;tate of health as an excu&s;e for his de&s;ertion of the
common cau&s;e<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 667. Vini&s;auf, p. 343. W. Heming. p. 527. Knyghton, p 2405.</NOTE>. He left, however, to Richard ten
thou&s;and of his troops, under the command of the duke
of Burgundy; and he renewed his oath never to com|mence
ho&s;tilities again&s;t that prince's dominions during
his ab&s;ence. But he had no &s;ooner reached Italy than he
applied to Pope Cele&s;tine III. for a di&s;pen&s;ation from
this vow<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 720. W. Heming. p. 527. Brompton, p. $221.</NOTE>; and when denied that reque&s;t, he &s;till
proceeded, tho' after a more covert manner, in a project,
which the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of England rendered &s;o in|viting,
and which gratified, in &s;o eminent a degree, both
his re&s;entment and his ambition.</P>
<P>IMMEDIATELY after Richard had left England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;orders in England.</NOTE> and
begun his march to the holy land, the two prelates, whom
he had appointed guardians of the realm, broke out into
the fierce&s;t animo&s;ities again&s;t each other, and threw the
whole kingdom into combu&s;tion. Longchamp, pre&s;ump|tuous
in his nature, elated by the favour of his ma&s;ter,
and armed with the legatine commi&s;&s;ion, could not &s;ub|mit
to an equality with the bi&s;hop of Durham; and even
went &s;o far as to arre&s;t the per&s;on of his colleague, and
<PB N="17" REF="24">
to extort from him a re&s;ignation of the earldom of
Northumberland, and of his other dignities, as the price
of his liberty<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 665. Knyghton, p. 2403.</NOTE>. The King, informed of the&s;e di&s;&s;en|&s;ions,
ordered, by letters from Mar&s;eilles, that the bi|&s;hop
&s;hould be rein&s;tated in all his offices; but Long|champ
had &s;till the boldne&s;s to refu&s;e compliance, on
pretence that he him&s;elf was better acquainted with the
King's &s;ecret intentions<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">W. Heming. p. 528.</NOTE>. He proceeded &s;till to govern
the kingdom by his &s;ole authority; to treat all the nobi|lity
with the greate&s;t arrogance; and to di&s;play his power
and riches with an invidious o&s;tentation. He never tra|velled
without a &s;trong guard of fifteen hundred foreign

the age was generally infe&s;ted<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 702.</NOTE>: Nobles and knights

in one night, the revenue of &s;everal years<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 680. Bened. Abb. p. 626, 700. Brompton, p. 1193.</NOTE>. The King,
who was detained in Europe longer than the haughty pre|late
expected, hearing of this o&s;tentation, which exceeded
even what the habits of that age indulged to eccle&s;ia&s;tics;
being al&s;o informed of the in&s;olent, tyrannical conduct
of his mini&s;ter; thought proper to re&s;train his exorbitant
power; and he &s;ent new orders, appointing Walter arch|bi&s;hop
of Ro&uuml;en, William Mare&s;hal earl of Strigul,
Geoffrey Fitz-Peter, William Briewere, and Hugh Bar|dolf,
coun&s;ellors to Longchamp, and commanding him to

&s;till maintained an uncontrouled authority over the na|tion<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 687.</NOTE>.
But when he proceeded &s;o far as to throw into
per&s;on Geoffrey archbi&s;hop of York, who had oppo&s;ed
his mea&s;ures<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 701. Bened. Abb. p. 697. W. Heming, p. 529.</NOTE>, this breach of eccle&s;ia&s;tical privileges ex|cited
&s;uch an univer&s;al ferment, that prince John, di&s;|gu&s;ted
with the &s;mall &s;hare he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the government,
and per&s;onally di&s;obliged by Longchamp, ventured to
&s;ummon at Reading a general council of the nobility
and prelates, and cite him to appear before them. Long|champ
thought it dangerous to entrust his per&s;on in their
hands, and he &s;hut him&s;elf up in the tower of London<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 698. M. Paris, p. 117. W. Heming. p. 530. Brompton, p. 1126.</NOTE>:
But being &s;oon obliged to &s;urrender that fortre&s;s, he fled
beyond &s;ea, concealed under a female habit, and was
deprived of his offices of chancellor and chief ju&s;ticiary;

The office of legate, however, which had been renewed
to Longchamp by Pope Celestine, &s;till gave him, not|with&s;tanding
his ab&s;ence, great authority in the king|dom,
enabled him to di&s;turb the government, and for|warded
the views of Philip, who watched every oppor|tunity

and had not the authority of Queen Eleanor, and the

of that turbulent prince, he was ready to have
cro&s;&s;ed the &s;eas, and to have put in execution his crimi|nal
enterprizes.</P>
<P>THE jealou&s;y of Philip was every moment excited by
the glory which the heroic actions of Richard were gain|ing
him in the Ea&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's heroic acti|ons in Pale|&s;tine.</NOTE> and which, being compared to his
own de&s;ertion of that popular cau&s;e, threw a double
lu&s;tre on his rival. His envy, therefore, prompted him
to ob&s;cure that fame, which he had not equalled; and he
embraced every pretence of throwing the mo&s;t violent
and mo&s;t improbable calumnies on the King of England.
There was a petty prince in A&s;ia, commonly called <HI>The
old man of the mountain,</HI> who had acquired &s;uch an a&s;|cendant
over his fanatical &s;ubjects, that they paid the mo&s;t
implicit deference to all his commands; e&s;teemed a&s;&s;a&s;&s;i|nation
meritorious, when &s;anctified by his mandate;
courted danger, and even certain death, in the execution
of his orders; and fancied, that where they &s;acrificed
their lives for his &s;ake, the highest joys of paradi&s;e were
the infallible reward of their devoted obedience<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">W. Heming. p. 532. Brompton, p. 1243.</NOTE>. It was
the cu&s;tom of this prince, when he imagined him&s;elf in|jured,
to di&s;patch &s;ecretly &s;ome of his &s;ubjects again&s;t
the aggre&s;&s;or, to charge them with the execution of his
revenge, to in&s;truct them in every art of di&s;gui&s;ing their
purpo&s;e; and no precaution was &s;ufficient to guard any
man, however powerful, again&s;t the attempts of the&s;e
&s;ubtle and determined ruffians. The greate&s;t monarchs
&s;tood in awe of this prince of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, (for that was
the name of his people; whence the word has been tran&s;|ferred
into mo&s;t European languages) and it was the
<PB N="20" REF="27">
highe&s;t indi&s;cretion of Conrade, marquis of Montferret,
to offend and affront him. The inhabitants of Tyre,
who were governed by that nobleman, had put to death
&s;ome of this dangerous people: The prince demanded &s;a|tisfaction;
for as he piqued him&s;elf on never beginning
any offence<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 71.</NOTE>, he had his regular and e&s;tabli&s;hed formali|ties
in requiring atonement: Conrade treated his me&s;&s;en|gers
with di&s;dain: The prince i&s;&s;ued his fatal orders:
Two of his &s;ubjects, who had in&s;inuated them&s;elves in
di&s;gui&s;e among Conrade's guards, openly, in the &s;treets
of Sidon, put him to death; and when they were &s;eized
and condemned to the mo&s;t cruel tortures, they triumphed
amid&s;t their agonies, and rejoiced that they had been de&s;|tined
by heaven to &s;uffer in &s;o ju&s;t and meritorious a cau&s;e.</P>
<P>EVERY one in Pale&s;tine knew from what hand the blow
came. Richard was entirely free from &s;u&s;picion. Tho'
that monarch had formerly maintained the cau&s;e of Lu|&s;ignan
again&s;t Conrade, he had become &s;en&s;ible of the
bad effects attending the&s;e di&s;&s;en&s;ions, and had volun|tarily
conferred on the former the kingdom of Cyprus,
on condition that he &s;hould re&s;ign to his rival all preten|&s;ions
to the crown of Jeru&s;alem<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Vini&s;auf, p. 391.</NOTE>. Conrade him&s;elf, with
his dying breath, had recommended his widow to the
protection of Richard<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Brompton, p. 1243.</NOTE>; the prince of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins a|vowed
the action in a formal narrative which he &s;ent to
Europe<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 71. Trivet, p. 124. W. Heming. p. 544. Diceto, p. 680.</NOTE>; yet, on this foundation, the King of France
thought fit to build the mo&s;t egregious calumnies, and to
impute to Richard the murder of the marquis of Mont|ferrat,
who&s;e elevation he had once openly oppo&s;ed. He
filled all Europe with exclamations again&s;t the crime;
appointed a guard to his own per&s;on, in order to defend
<PB N="21" REF="28">
him&s;elf again&s;t a like attempt<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">W. Heming. p. 532. Brompton, p. 1243.</NOTE>; and endeavoured, by
the&s;e &s;hallow artifices, to cover the infamy of attacking
the dominions of a prince, whom he him&s;elf had de|&s;erted,
and who was engaged with &s;o much glory in a
war, univer&s;ally acknowledged to be the common cau&s;e
of Chri&s;tendom.</P>
<P>BUT Richard's heroic actions in Pale&s;tine were the be&s;t
apology for his conduct. The chri&s;tian adventurers un|der
his command determined, on opening the campaign,
to attempt the &s;iege of A&s;calon, in order to prepare the
way for that of Jeru&s;alem; and they marched along the
&s;ea-coa&s;t with that intention. Saladin propo&s;ed to intercept
their pa&s;&s;age; and he placed him&s;elf on the road with an
army, amounting to 300,000 combatants. On this oc|ca&s;ion
was fought one of the greate&s;t battles of that age;
and the mo&s;t celebrated, for the military genius of the
commanders, for the number and valour of the troops,
and for the great variety of events which attended it.
Both the right wing of the Chri&s;tians, commanded by
d'Ave&s;nes, and the left, headed by the duke of Burgun|dy,
were, in the beginning of the day, broken and de|feated;
when Richard, who led on the main body, re|&s;tored
the battle; attacked the enemy with admirable in|trepidity
and pre&s;ence of mind; performed the part both
of a con&s;ummate general and gallant &s;oldier; and not
only gave his two wings lei&s;ure to recover from their
confu&s;ion, but obtained a compleat victory over the Sara|cens,
of whom forty thou&s;and are &s;aid to have peri&s;hed
in the field<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 698. Bened. Abb. p. 677. Diceto, p. 662. Brompton, p. 1214.</NOTE>. A&s;calon &s;oon after fell into the hands of
the Chri&s;tians: Other &s;ieges were carried on with &s;ucce&s;s:
Richard was even able to advance within &s;ight of Jeru|&s;alem,
the object of all his enterprizes; when he had the
mortification to find, that he mu&s;t abandon all hopes of
<PB N="22" REF="29">
immediate &s;ucce&s;s, and mu&s;t put a &s;top to his career of vic|tory.
The cru&s;aders, animated with an enthu&s;ia&s;tic ardor for
the holy wars, broke at fir&s;t thro' all regards to &s;afety or
intere&s;t in the pro&s;ecution of their purpo&s;e; and tru&s;ting
to the immediate a&s;&s;i&s;tance of heaven, &s;et nothing before
their eyes but fame and victory in this world, and a
crown of glory in the next. But long ab&s;ence from home,
fatigue, di&s;ea&s;e, want, and the varieties of &s;ucce&s;s which
naturally attend war, had gradually abated that fury,
which nothing was able directly to with&s;tand; and every
one, except the King of England, expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of
&s;peedily returning into Europe. The Germans and the
Italians declared their re&s;olution of de&s;i&s;ting from the en|terprize:
The French were &s;till more ob&s;tinate in this
purpo&s;e: The duke of Burgundy, in order to pay court
to Philip, took all opportunities of mortifying and oppo|&s;ing
Richard<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Vini&s;auf, p. 380.</NOTE>: And there appeared an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity
of abandoning for the pre&s;ent all hopes of farther con|que&s;t,
and of &s;ecuring the acqui&s;itions of the Chri&s;tians
by an accommodation with Saladin. Richard, therefore,
concluded a truce with that monarch; and &s;tipulated,
that Acre, Joppa, and other &s;eaport towns of Pale&s;tine,
should remain in the hands of the Chri&s;tians, and that
every one of that religion &s;hould have liberty to perform
his pilgrimage to Jeru&s;alem unmole&s;ted<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. 123.</NOTE>. This truce was
concluded for three years, three months, three weeks,
three days, and three hours; a magical number, which
had probably been devi&s;ed by the Europeans, and which
was &s;ugge&s;ted by a &s;urper&s;tition well &s;uited to the object
of the war.</P>
<P>THE liberty in which Saladin indulged the Chri&s;tians,
to perform their pilgrimages to Jeru&s;alem, was an ea&s;y
&s;acrifice on his part; and the furious wars, which he
waged in defence of the barren territory of Judea, were
<PB N="23" REF="30">
not with him, as with the European adventurers, the re|&s;ult
of &s;uper&s;tition, but of policy. The advantage indeed of
&s;cience, moderation, humanity, was at that time en|tirely
on the &s;ide of the Saracens; and this gallant Em|peror,
in particular, di&s;played, during the cour&s;e of the
war, a &s;pirit and genero&s;ity, which even his bigotted ene|mies
were obliged to acknowledge and admire. Richards,
equally martial and brave, carried with him more of the
barbarian character; and was guilty of acts of ferocity,
which throw a &s;tain on his celebrated victories. When
Saladin refu&s;ed to ratify the capitulation of Acre, the
King of England, ordered all his pri&s;oners, to the num|ber
of five thou&s;and, to be butchered; and the Saracens
found them&s;elves obliged to retaliate upon the Chri&s;tians
by a like cruelty<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 697. Bened. Abb. p. 673. M. Paris, p. 115. Vini&s;auf, p. 346. W. Homing. p. 531.</NOTE>. Saladin died at Dama&s;cus &s;oon after
the conclu&s;ion of the truce with the princes of the cru|&s;ade;
and it is memorable, that, before he expired, he
ordered his winding-&s;heet to be carried as a &s;tandard
thro' every &s;treet of the city; while a crier went before,
and proclaimed with a loud voice, <HI>This is all that remains
to the mighty Saladin, the conqueror of the Ea&s;t.</HI> By his la&s;t
will, he ordered charities to be di&s;tributed to the poor,
without di&s;tinction of Jew, Chri&s;tian, or Mahometan.</P>
<P>THERE remained,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's return from Pale&s;tine.</NOTE> after the truce, no bu&s;ine&s;s of im|portance
to detain Richard in Pale&s;tine; and the intelli|gence
which he received, of the intrigues of his brother
John, and of the King of France, made him &s;en&s;ible,
that his pretence was nece&s;&s;ary in Europe<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Brompton, p. 1243.</NOTE>. As he
dared not to pa&s;s thro' France, he &s;ailed to the Adriatic;
and being &s;hipwrecked near Aquileia, he put on the di&s;|gui&s;e
of a pilgrim, with a purpo&s;e of taking his journey
&s;ecretly thro' Germany. Pur&s;ued by the governor
<PB N="24" REF="31">
of Istria<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 70.</NOTE>, he was forced out of the direct road to Eng|land,
and was obliged to pa&s;s by Vienna; where his ex|pences
and liberalities betrayed the monarch in the habit
of the pilgrim;<NOTE PLACE="marg">20th De|cember.</NOTE> and he was arre&s;ted by orders of Leo|pold,
duke of Au&s;tria<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 717. M. Paris, p. 121. Trivet, p. 124. Knyghton, p. 2407.</NOTE>. This prince had &s;erved under
Richard at the &s;iege of Acre; but being di&s;gu&s;ted by
&s;ome in&s;ult of this haughty monarch, he was &s;o ungene|rous
as to &s;eize the pre&s;ent opportunity of gratifying at
once his avarice and revenge;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1193.</NOTE> and he threw the King
into pri&s;on<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 118. W. Heming. p. 535. Brompton, p. 1250.</NOTE>. The Emperor, Henry VI. who al&s;o con|&s;idered
Richard as an enemy, on account of the alliance
contracted by him with Tancred, King of Sicily, di&s;|patched
me&s;&s;engers to the duke of Au&s;tria, required the
royal pri&s;oner to be delivered to him, and &s;tipulated a
large &s;um of money as a reward for this &s;ervice<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">M. We&s;t. P. 258.</NOTE>. Thus,
the King of England, who had filled the whole world
with his renown and glory,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Captivity in Germany.</NOTE> found him&s;elf, during the
mo&s;t critical &s;tate of his affairs, confined to a dungeon,
and loaded with irons, in the heart of Germany<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Chron. T. Wykes, p. 35.</NOTE>, and
entirely at the mercy of his enemies, the ba&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t

<P>THE Engli&s;h council were a&s;toni&s;hed on receiving this
fatal intelligence; and fore&s;aw all the dangerous con&s;e|quences,
which might naturally ari&s;e from that event.
The Queen-dowager wrote reiterated letters to Pope Ce|le&s;tine;
exclaiming again&s;t the injury which her &s;on had &s;u&s;tained,
repre&s;enting the impiety of detaining in pri&s;on
the mo&s;t illu&s;trious prince who had yet carried the ban|ners
of Chri&s;t into the holy land; claiming the protec|tion
of the apo&s;tolic &s;ee, which was due even to the
meane&s;t of the&s;e adventurers; and upbraiding the Pope,
<PB N="25" REF="32">
that in a cau&s;e where ju&s;tice, religion, and the dignity
of the church, were &s;o much concerned; a cau&s;e, which
it might well befit his Holine&s;s himfelf to &s;upport by tak|ing

to the impatience of the Queen-mother; and the regency
of England were, for a long time, left to &s;truggle by them|&s;elves,
with all their dome&s;tic and foreign enemies.</P>
<P>THE King of France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with France.</NOTE> quickly informed of Richard's
confinement by a me&s;&s;age from the Emperor<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 70.</NOTE>, prepared
himfelf to take advantage of that incident; and he em|ployed
every means of force and intrigue, of war and
negotiation, again&s;t the dominions and the per&s;on of his
unfortunate rival. He revived the calumny of Richard's
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating the marquis of Montferrat; and by that ab|&s;urd
pretence, he induced his barons to violate their oaths,
by which they had engaged, that, during the cru&s;ade,
they never would, on any account, attack the dominions
of the King of England<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 717. Brompton, p. 1244.</NOTE>. He made the Emperor the
large&s;t offers, if he would deliver into his hands the royal
pri&s;oner, or at lea&s;t detain him in perpetual captivity;
and he even formed an alliance by marriage with the
King of Denmark, de&s;ired that the antient Dani&s;h claim

John, who, forgetting every tye to his brother, his &s;ove|reign,

to deliver into Philip's hands a great part of Normandy<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 85.</NOTE>;
and in return, he received the inve&s;titure of all Richard's
tran&s;marine dominions; and it is reported by &s;everal hi&s;|torians,
that he even did homage to the French King
for the crown of England.</P>
<P>IN con&s;equence of this treaty, Philip invaded Nor|mandy;
and by the treachery of John's emi&s;&s;aries, made
him&s;elf ma&s;ter, without oppo&s;ition, of many fortre&s;&s;es,
Neuf-chatel, Neaufle, Gi&s;ors, Pacey, Ivre&eacute;<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">W. Heming. p. 537.</NOTE>: He &s;ub|dued

to the &s;word, if they dared to make the lea&s;t re|&s;i&s;tance

appeared in that critical moment; a gallant nobleman,
who had acquired great honour, during the cru&s;ade, and
who being more fortunate than his ma&s;ter in finding his
pa&s;&s;age homewards, took on him the command in Ro&uuml;en,

courage into the di&s;mayed Normans<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 724. M. Paris, p. 122.</NOTE>. Philip was

<P>PRINCE John, who, with a view of increa&s;ing the ge|neral
confu&s;ion, went over to England, was le&s;s &s;ucce&s;s|ful
in his enterprizes. He was only able to make him|&s;elf
ma&s;ter of the ca&s;tles of Wind&s;or and Wallingford;
but when he arrived in London, and claimed the king|dom
<PB N="27" REF="36">
as heir to his brother, of who&s;e death he pretended
to have received certain intelligence, he was rejected by
all the barons, and mea&s;ures were taken to oppo&s;e and
&s;ubdue him<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 724.</NOTE>. The ju&s;ticiaries, &s;upported by the gene|ral
affections of the people, provided &s;o well for the de|fence
of the kingdom, that John was obliged, after
&s;ome fruitle&s;s efforts, to conclude a truce with them; and
before its expiration, he thought it prudent to return into
France, and he openly acknowledged his alliance with
Philip<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">W. Heming. p. 536,</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MEAN while, the high &s;pirit of Richard &s;uffered in
Germany every kind of in&s;ult and indignity. The
French amba&s;&s;adors, in their ma&s;ter's name, renounced
him as a va&s;&s;al to the crown of France, and declared all
his fiefs to be forfeited to his liege-lord. The Emperor,
that he might render him more impatient for the reco|very
of his liberty, and make him &s;ubmit to the pay|ment
of a larger ran&s;om, treated him with the greate&s;t
&s;everity, and reduced him to a condition wor&s;e than that
of the meane&s;t malefactor. He was even produced be|fore
the diet of the empire at Worms, and accu&s;ed by
Henry of many crimes and mi&s;demeanors; of making an
alliance with Tancred, the u&s;urper of Sicily; of turn|ing
the arms of the cru&s;ade again&s;t a Chri&s;tian prince,
and &s;ubduing Cyprus; of affronting the duke of Au&s;tria
before Acre; of ob&s;tructing the progre&s;s of the Chri&s;tian
arms by his quarrels wiih the King of France; of a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;inating
Conrade, marquis of Montferrat; and of con|cluding
a truce with Saladin, and leaving Jeru&s;alem in
the hands of the Saracen Emperor<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 121. W. Heming. p. 536.</NOTE>. Richard, who&s;e
&s;pirit was not broke by all his misfortunes, and who&s;e
genius was rather rouzed by the&s;e frivolous or &s;candalous
imputations; after premi&s;ing, that his royal dignity ex|empted
him from an&s;wering before any juri&s;diction, ex|cept
<PB N="28" REF="37">
that of heaven; yet conde&s;cended, for the &s;ake of
his reputation, to ju&s;tify his conduct before that great a&s;|&s;embly.
He ob&s;erved, that he had no hand in Tancred's
elevation, and only concluded a treaty with a prince,
whom he found in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne: That the
King, or rather tyrant of Cyprus, had provoked his in|dignation
by the mo&s;t ungenerous and unju&s;t proceedings;
and tho' he cha&s;ti&s;ed this aggre&s;&s;or, he had not retarded
a moment the progre&s;s of his chief enterprize: That if
he had been at any time wanting in civility to the duke
of Au&s;tria, he had already been puni&s;hed &s;ufficiently for
that &s;ally of pa&s;&s;ion; and it better became men, em|barked
together in &s;o holy a cau&s;e, to forgive each other's
infirmities, than to pur&s;ue a &s;light offence with &s;uch un|relenting
vengeance: That it had sufficiently appeared by
the event, whether the King of France or he was mo&s;t
zealous for the conque&s;t of the holy land, and was mo&s;t
likely to &s;acrifice private pa&s;&s;ions and animo&s;ities to that
great object: That if the whole tenor of his life had
not &s;hown him incapable of a ba&s;e a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, and ju&s;|tified
him from that imputation in the eyes of his very
enemies, it was in vain for him, at pre&s;ent, to make his
apology, or plead the many irrefragable arguments, which
he could produce in his own favour: And that, however
he might regret the nece&s;&s;ity, he was &s;o far from being
a&s;hamed of his truce with Saladin, that he rather gloried
in that event; and thought it extremely honourable, that,
tho' abandoned by all the world, &s;upported only by his
own courage and by the &s;mall remains of his national
troops, he could yet obtain &s;uch conditions from the
mo&s;t powerful and mo&s;t warlike Emperor that the Ea&s;t
had ever yet produced. Richard, after thus deigning to
apologize for his conduct, bur&s;t out into indignation at
the cruel treatment which he had met with; that he,
the champion of the cro&s;s, &s;till wearing that honourable
badge, &s;hould, after expending the blood and trea&s;ure of
<PB N="29" REF="38">
his &s;ubjects in the common cau&s;e of Chri&s;tendom, be in|tercepted
by Chri&s;tian princes in his return to his own
country, be thrown into a dungeon, be loaded with
irons, be obliged to plead his cau&s;e, as if he were a &s;ub|ject
and a malefactor; and what he &s;till more regretted,
be thereby prevented from making his preparations for a
new cru&s;ade, which he projected, after the expiration of
the truce, and from redeeming the &s;epulchre of Chri&s;t,
which had &s;o long been profaned by the dominion of the
infidels. The &s;pirit and eloquence of Richard made
&s;uch impre&s;&s;ion on the German princes, that they ex|claimed
loudly again&s;t the conduct of the Emperor; the
Pope threatened him with excommunication; and Henry,
who had hearkened to the propo&s;als of the King of France
and prince John, found that it would be impracticable
for him to execute his and their ba&s;e purpo&s;es, and detain
the King of England any longer in captivity. He there|fore
concluded with him a treaty for his ran&s;om,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's delivery.</NOTE> and a|greed
to re&s;tore him to his freedom for the &s;um of 150,000
marks, about 300,000 pounds of our pre&s;ent money; of
which 100,000 marks was to be paid before he received
his liberty, and &s;ixty-&s;even ho&s;tages delivered for the re|mainder<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 728. M. Paris, p. 122. Diceto, p. 670. Rymer, vol. i. p. 84.</NOTE>.
The Emperor, as if to glo&s;s over the infa|my
of this tran&s;action, made at the &s;ame time a pre&s;ent
to Richard of the kingdom of Arles, comprehending Pro|vence,
Dauphiny, Narbonne, and other &s;tates, over
which the empire had &s;ome antiquated claims, that the
King very wi&s;ely neglected<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 732.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE captivity of the &s;uperior lord was one of the ca&s;es
provided for by the feudal tenures; and all the va&s;&s;als
were in that event obliged to give an aid for his ran&s;om.
Twenty &s;hillings were therefore levied on each knight's fee
<PB N="30" REF="39">
in England<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 726, 731.</NOTE>; but as this money came in &s;lowly, and
was not &s;ufficient for the intended purpo&s;e, the volun|tary
zeal of the people readily &s;upplied the defect<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 122. Ann. Waverl. p. 164. W. Heming. p. 538.</NOTE>.
The churches and mona&s;teries melted down their plate,
to the amount of 30,000 marks; the bi&s;hops, abbots,
and nobles, paid a fourth of their yearly rent; the pa|rochial
clergy contributed a tenth of their tythes: And
the requi&s;ite &s;um being thus collected, Queen Eleanor,
and Walter archbi&s;hop of Ro&uuml;en, &s;et out with it for
Germany;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1194.</NOTE> paid the money to the Emperor and the duke
of Au&s;tria at Mentz;<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th Feb.</NOTE> delivered them ho&s;tages for the
remainder; and freed Richard from his captivity. His
e&s;cape was very critical. Henry had been detected in the
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of the bi&s;hop of Liege, and in an attempt
of a like nature on the duke of Louvaine; and finding
him&s;elf extremely obnoxious to the German princes on
account of the&s;e odious practices, he had determined to
&s;eek &s;upport from an alliance with the French King<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 727. Neubrig. W. Heming. p. 539.</NOTE>;
to detain Richard, the enemy of that prince, in perpe|tual
captivity; to keep in his hands the money which he
had already received for his ran&s;om; and to extort new
&s;ums from Philip and Prince John, who were very liberal
in their offers to him<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 733.</NOTE>. He therefore gave orders that
Richard &s;hould be pur&s;ued and arre&s;ted; but the King
making all imaginable ha&s;te, had already embarked at
the mouth of the Schelde, and was out of &s;ight of land
when the me&s;&s;engers of the Emperor reached Ant|werp.</P>
<P>THE joy of the Engli&s;h was extreme on the appear|ance
of their monarch,<NOTE PLACE="marg">King's re|turn to Eng|land. 20th March.</NOTE> who had &s;uffered &s;o many cala|mities,

&s;pread the reputation of their name into the farthe&s;t Ea&s;t,
whither their &s;ame had never before been able to extend<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">W. Heming. p. 539.</NOTE>.
He gave them, &s;oon after his arrival, an opportunity of
di&s;playing publicly their exultation, by ordering him&s;elf
to be crowned anew at Winche&s;ter; as if he intended,
by that ceremony, to rein&s;tate him&s;elf in his throne, and
to wipe off the ignominy of his captivity<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 738. M. Paris, p. 12$.</NOTE>. Their &s;ati&s;|faction
was not even damped, when he declared his pur|po&s;e
of making a general re&s;umption of tho&s;e exorbitant
grants, which he had been nece&s;&s;itated to agree to before
his departure for the holy land. The barons al&s;o, in a
great council, forfeited, on account of his trea&s;on, all
prince John's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in England; and they a&s;&s;i&s;ted
the King in reducing the fortre&s;&s;es which &s;till remained
in the hands of his brother's adherents<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 737. Ann. Waverl. p. 165. W. Heming. p. 540.</NOTE>: And Richard,
having &s;ettled every thing in England, pa&s;&s;ed over with
an army into Normandy; being impatient to make war
on Philip, and to revenge him&s;$lf for the many injuries
which he had received from that monarch<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 740.</NOTE>. So &s;oon as
Philip heard of the King's delivery from captivity, he
wrote to his confederate, John, in the&s;e terms: <HI>Take
care of your&s;elf: The devil is broke loose</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 739.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN we con&s;ider two &s;uch powerful and martial
monarchs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with France.</NOTE> inflamed with per&s;onal animo&s;ity to each other,
enraged by mutual injuries, excited by rival&s;hip, im|pelled
by oppo&s;ite intere&s;ts, and in&s;tigated by the pride
and violence of their own temper; our curio&s;ity is natu|rally
rai&s;ed, and we expect an ob&s;tinate and furious
war, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the greate&s;t events, and concluded
by &s;ome remarkable cata&s;trophe. Yet are the incidents
which attended the&s;e ho&s;tilities &s;o frivolous, that &s;carce any
hi&s;torian can entertain &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ion for military descrip|tions
<PB N="32" REF="41">
as to venture on a detail of them: A certain proof of
the extreme weaken&s;s of princes in tho&s;e ages, and of
the little authority they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed over their refractory
va&s;&s;als! The whole amount of the exploits on both &s;ides
is, the taking a ca&s;tle, the &s;urpri&s;e of a &s;traggling party,
a rencounter of hor&s;e, which re&s;embles more a rout
than a battle. Richard obliged Philip to rai&s;e the &s;iege
of Verne&uuml;il; he took Loches, a &s;mall town in Anjou;
he made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Beaumont, and &s;ome other
places of little con&s;equence; and after the&s;e trivial ex|ploits,
the two Kings began already to hold conferences
for an accommodation. Philip in&s;i&s;ted, that, if a gene|ral
peace was concluded, the barons on each &s;ide &s;hould
be prohibited from carrying on private wars again&s;t each
other: But Richard replied, that this was a right claimed
by his va&s;&s;als, and he could not debar them of it<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 741.</NOTE>. Af|ter
this fruitle&s;s negotiation, there en&s;ued an action be|tween
the French and Engli&s;h cavalry at Fretteval, in
which the former were routed, and the King of France's
cartulary and records, which commonly at that time at|tended
his per&s;on, were taken<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. Philip had his revenge
for this defeat, by an advantage which he obtained before
Vaudre&uuml;il: And a truce for a year was at la&s;t, from mu|tual
weaken&s;s, concluded between the two monarchs<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">W. Heming p. 541.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>DURING this war, prince John de&s;erted Philip, threw
him&s;elf at his brother's feet, craved pardon for his offen|ces,
and by the interce&s;&s;ion of Queen Eleanor, was re|ceived
into favour<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 122. W. Heming. P. 542.</NOTE>. <HI>I forgive him,</HI> &s;aid the King, <HI>and
hope I &s;hall as ea&s;ily forget hit injuries, as he will my pardon.</HI>
John was incapable even of returning to his duty, with|out
committing a ba&s;ene&s;s. Before he left Philip's party,
he invited to dinner all the officers of the garri&s;on, which
<PB N="33" REF="42">
that prince had placed in the citadel of Evreux; he treacherou&s;ly ma&s;&s;acred them during the entertainment;
fell, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the town&s;men, on the garri|&s;on,
whom he put to the &s;word; and then delivered up
the place to his brother<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Phillipid. lib. 4. p. 143. Rigord, p. 77.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King of France was the great object of Richard's
re&s;entment and animo&s;ity: The conduct of his brother
John, as well as of the Emperor and duke of Au&s;tria,
had been &s;o ba&s;e and mean, and was expo&s;ed to &s;uch ge|neral
odium and reproach, that the King deemed him|&s;elf
&s;ufficiently revenged for their injuries; and as it is
impo&s;&s;ible to hate heartily a per&s;on whom one de&s;pi&s;es,
he &s;eems never to have entertained any project of ven|geance
again&s;t any of them. The duke of Au&s;tria,
about this time, having cru&s;hed his leg by the fall of
his hor&s;e at a tournament, was thrown into a fever; and
being &s;truck, on the approaches of death, with remor&s;e
for his inju&s;tice to Richard, he ordered, by will, all the
Engli&s;h ho&s;tages to be &s;et at liberty, and the remainder of
the debt to be remitted<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 125. W. Heming. p. 542. Diceto, p. 678.</NOTE>: His &s;on, who &s;eemed inclined
to di&s;obey the&s;e orders, was con&s;trained by his ec|cle&s;ia&s;tics
to execute them<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 88. 102.</NOTE>. The Emperor al&s;o made
advances for Richard's friend&s;hip, and offered to give
him a di&s;charge of all his debt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1195.</NOTE> provided he would enter
into an offen&s;ive alliance again&s;t the King of France;
a propo&s;al which was very acceptable to Richard, and
was greedily embraced by him. The treaty with the
Emperor took no effect; but it &s;erved to rekindle the
war between France and England before the expiration
of the truce. This war was not di&s;tingui&s;hed by any
more remarkable incident than the former. After mutu|ally
ravaging the open country, and taking a few in&s;ig|nificant
<PB N="34" REF="43">
ca&s;tles, the two Kings concluded a peace at
Louviers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1196.</NOTE> and yielded up &s;ome territories to each other<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 91.</NOTE>.
Their inability to make war occa&s;ioned the peace:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1196.</NOTE> Their
mutual antipathy engaged them again in war before two
months expired. Richard imagined, that he had now
got an opportunity of &s;triking a &s;evere blow on his rival,
by forming an alliance with the counts of Flanders,
Tholou&s;e, Boulogne, Champagne, and other con&s;idera|ble
va&s;&s;als of the crown of France<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">W. Heming. p. 549. Brompton, p. 1273. Rymer, vol. i. p. 94.</NOTE>. But he &s;oon ex|perienced
the in&s;incerity of the&s;e princes; and was not
able to make any impre&s;&s;ion on that kingdom, while go|verned
by a prince of &s;o much vigour and activity as Phi|lip.
The mo&s;t remarkable incident of this war was the
taking pri&s;oner in battle the bi&s;hop of Beauvais, a mar|tial
prelate, who was of the family of Dreux, and a
near relation of the French King. Richard, who hated
that bi&s;hop, threw him into pri&s;on, and loaded him with
irons; and when the Pope demanded his liberty, and
claimed him as his &s;on, the King &s;ent his Holine&s;s the
coat of mail which the prelate had worn in battle, and
which was all be&s;meared with blood. And he replied to
him, in the terms employed by Jacob's &s;ons to that patriarch,
<HI>This have we found: Know now whether it be thy
&s;on's coat or no</HI><NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Gene&s;. chap. xxxvii. ver&s;e 32. M. Paris, p. 128. Brompton, p. 1273.</NOTE>. This war between England and France,
tho' carried on with &s;uch animo&s;ity, that both Kings fre|quently
put out the eyes of their pri&s;oners, was &s;oon
fini&s;hed, by a truce of five years; and immediately after
&s;igning this treaty, the Kings were ready, on &s;ome new
offence, to break out again into ho&s;tilities; when the
mediation of the cardinal of St. Mary, the Pope's legate,
accommodated the difference<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 109, 110.</NOTE>. This prelate even en|gaged
the princes to commence a treaty for a more dur|able
<PB N="35" REF="44">
peace; but the death of Richard put an end to the negotiation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1199.</NOTE></P>
<P>VIDOMAR,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1199.</NOTE> vi&s;count of Limoges, a va&s;&s;al of the King,
had found a trea&s;ure, of which he &s;ent a part to that
prince as a prefent. Richard, as &s;uperior lord, claimed
the whole; and at the head of &s;ome Braban&ccedil;ons, be|&s;ieged
the vi&s;count in the ca&s;tle of Chalus, near Limo|ges,
in order to make him comply with his demand<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 791. Knyghton, p. 2413.</NOTE>.
The garri&s;on offered to &s;urrender; but the King replied,
that, &s;ince he had taken the pains to come thither and be|&s;iege
the place in per&s;on, he would take it by force, and
would hang every one of them. The &s;ame day, Richard,
accompanied by Marcad&eacute;e, leader of his Braban&ccedil;ons,
approached the ca&s;tle in order to &s;urvey it; when one
Bertrand de Gourdon, an archer, took an aim at him,
and pierced his &s;houlder with an arrow. The King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">28th March.</NOTE>
however, gave orders for the a&s;&s;ault, took the place, and
hanged all the garri&s;on, except Gourdon, who had
wounded him, and whom he re&s;erved for a more delibe|rate
and more cruel execution<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE wound was not in it&s;elf dangerous; but the un|skilfulness
of the &s;urgeon made it mortal: He &s;o rankled
Richard's &s;houlder in pulling out the arrow, that a
gangrene commenced; and that prince was now &s;en&s;ible
that his life was drawing towards a period. He &s;ent for
Gourdon, and a&s;ked him, <HI>Wretch, what have I ever
done to you, to oblige you to &s;eek my life?&mdash;What have you done
to me?</HI> replied coolly the pri&s;oner: <HI>You killed with your
own hands my father, and my two brother; and you intended
to have hanged my&s;elf: I am now in your power, and you may
take revenge, by inflicting on me the mo&s;t &s;evere torments: But
I &s;hall endure them all with plea&s;ure, provided I can think that
<PB N="36" REF="45">
with my own hands I have rid the world of &s;uch a nui&s;ance</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 791. Brompton, p. 1277. Knyghton, p. 2413.</NOTE>.
Richard, &s;truck with the rea&s;onablene&s;s of this reply,
and humbled by the near approach of death, ordered
Gourdon to be &s;et at liberty, and a &s;um of money to be
given him; but Marcad&eacute;e, unknown to him, &s;eized the
unhappy man, flead him alive, and then hanged him.
Richard died in the tenth year of his reign,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th April. Death</NOTE> and the forty-&s;econd
of his age; and he left no i&s;&s;ue behind him.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t &s;hining part of this prince's character was
his military talents.<NOTE PLACE="marg">and charac|ter of the King.</NOTE> No man, even in that romantic age,
carried per&s;onal courage and intrepidity to a greater
height; and this quality gained him the appellation of
the lion-hearted, <HI>coeur de lion.</HI> He pa&s;&s;ionately loved
glory, chiefly military glory; and as his conduct in the
field was not inferior to his valour, he &s;eems to have
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed every talent nece&s;&s;ary for acquiring it. His re|&s;entments
al&s;o were high; his pride unconquerable; and
his &s;ubjects, as well as his neighbours, had therefore rea&s;on
to apprehend, from the continuance of his reign, a perpe|tual
&s;cene of blood and violence. Of an impetuous and
vehement &s;pirit, he was di&s;tingui&s;hed by all the good,
as well as the bad qualities, which are incident to that
character: He was open, frank, generous, &s;incere, and
brave; he was revengeful, domineering, ambitious,
haughty, and cruel; and was thus better calculated to
dazzle men by the &s;plendor of his enterprizes, than ei|ther
to promote their happine&s;s or his own grandeur, by
a &s;ound and well regulated policy. As military talents
make great impre&s;&s;ion on the people, he &s;eems to have
been much beloved by his Engli&s;h &s;ubject&s;: and
he is remarked to have been the fir&s;t prince of the
Norman line who bore a &s;incere affection and re|gard
to them. He pa&s;&s;ed however only four months of
<PB N="37" REF="46">
his reign in that kingdom: The cru&s;ade employed him
near three years; he was detained about fourteen months
in captivity; the re&s;t of his reign was &s;pent either in
war, or preparations for war, again&s;t France; and he
was &s;o plea&s;ed with the fame which he had acquired in
the Ea&s;t, that he &s;eems to have determined, notwith|&s;tanding
all his pa&s;t misfortunes, to have farther ex|hau&s;ted
his kingdom, and to have expo&s;ed him&s;elf to new
hazards, by conducting another expedition again&s;t the
infidels.</P>
<P>THO' the Engli&s;h plea&s;ed them&s;elves with the glory
which the King's martial talents procured them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mi&s;cellane|ous tran&s;ac|tions of this reign.</NOTE> his
reign was very oppre&s;&s;ive, and &s;omewhat arbitrary, by
the high taxes which he levied on them, and often with|out
the con&s;ent of the &s;tates or great council. In the
ninth of his reign, he levied five &s;hillings on each hyde
of land; and becau&s;e the clergy refu&s;ed to contribute
their &s;hare, he put them out of the protection of law,
and ordered the civil courts to give them no &s;entence for
any debts which they might claim<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 743. Tyrrel, vol. 2. p. 563.</NOTE>. Twice in his
reign he ordered all his charters to be &s;ealed anew, and
the parties to pay fees for the renewal<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Prynne's Chronol. Vindic. tom. i. p. 1133.</NOTE>. It is &s;aid that
Hubert, his ju&s;ticiary, &s;ent him over to France, in the
&s;pace of two years, no le&s;s a &s;um than 1,100,000 marks,
be&s;ides bearing all the charges of the government in
England. But this account is quite incredible, unle&s;s
we &s;uppo&s;e that he made an extreme dilapidation of the
deme&s;nes of the crown. A King who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch a
revenue could never have endured fourteen months cap|tivity,
for not paying 150,000 marks to the Emperor,
and be obliged at la&s;t to leave ho&s;tages for a third of the
&s;um. The prices of commodities in this reign are al&s;o
a certain proof, that no &s;uch enormous &s;um could be le|vied
<PB N="38" REF="47">
from the people. A hyde of land, or a hundred and
twenty acres, was commonly let for twenty &s;hillings a-year,
money of that time. The general and &s;tated price
of an ox was four &s;hillings; of a labouring hor&s;e, the
&s;ame; of a &s;ow, one &s;hilling; of a &s;heep with fine wool,
ten pence; with coar&s;e wool, &s;ix pence<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 745.</NOTE>. The&s;e commo|dities

<P>RICHARD renewed the &s;evere laws again&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors
in his fore&s;ts, whom he puni&s;hed by ca&s;tration and put|ting
out their eyes, as in the reign of his great-grand|father.
He e&s;tabli&s;hed by law one weight and mea&s;ure throughout his kingdom<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 109, 134. Trivet, p. 127. Ann. Waverl. p. 165. Hoveden, p. 774.</NOTE>.
An u&s;eful in&s;titution, which
the mercenary di&s;po&s;ition and nece&s;&s;ities of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or
engaged him to di&s;pen&s;e with for money.</P>
<P>THE di&s;orders in London, derived from its bad police,
had ri&s;en to a great height during this reign; and in the
year 1196, there &s;eemed to be formed a regular con&s;pi|racy
of the malefactors, which threatened the city with
de&s;truction. There was one William Fitz-O&s;bert, com|monly
called <HI>Longbeard,</HI> a lawyer, who had rendered
him&s;elf extremely popular among the lower rank of citi|zens;
and by defending them on all occa&s;ions, had ac|quired
the appellation of the advocate or &s;aviour of the
poor. He exerted his authority, by injuring and in&s;ult|ing
the more &s;ub&s;tantial inhabitants, with whom he lived
in a &s;tate of ho&s;tility, and who were every moment ex|po&s;ed
to the mo&s;t outragious violences from him and his
licentious emi&s;&s;aries. Murders were daily committed in
the &s;treets; hou&s;es were broke open and pillaged in day-light;
and it is pretended, that no le&s;s than fifty-two
thou&s;and per&s;ons had &s;igned an a&s;&s;ociation, by which
<PB N="39" REF="48">
they bound them&s;elves to obey all the orders of this dan|gerous
ruffian. Archbi&s;hop Hubert, who was then chief
ju&s;ticiary, &s;ummoned him before the council to an&s;wer
for his conduct; but he came &s;o well attended, that no
one dur&s;t accu&s;e him, or bear evidence again&s;t him; and
the primate, finding the impotence of laws, contented
him&s;elf with exacting from the citizens ho&s;tages for their
good behaviour. He kept, however, a watchful eye on
William; and &s;eizing a favourable opportunity, at|tempted
to commit him to cu&s;tody; but the criminal,
murdering one of the public officers, e&s;caped with his
concubine to the church of St. Mary le Bow, where he
defended him&s;elf by force of arms. He was at la&s;t forced
from his retreat, condemned, and executed, amid&s;t the
infinite regrets of the populace, who were &s;o devoted to
his memory, that they &s;tole his gibbet, paid it the &s;ame
veneration as to the cro&s;s, and were equally zealous in
propagating and atte&s;ting reports of the miracles which were
wrought by it<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 765. Diceto, p. 691. Neubrig. p. 492, 493.</NOTE>. But tho' the &s;ectaries of this &s;u|per&s;tition
were puni&s;hed by the ju&s;ticiary<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Gerva&s;e, p. 1591.</NOTE>, it received &s;o
little encouragement from the e&s;tabli&s;hed clergy, who&s;e
property was endangered by &s;uch &s;editious practices, that
it &s;uddenly sunk and vani&s;hed.</P>

in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; inventions &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve or|der

di&s;cord and of u&s;urpation, and to beget moderation in that
&s;pecies of government, by giving &s;ecurity to the ruling
&s;overeign. The&s;e innovations aro&s;e from the feudal law;
which, fir&s;t introducing the right of primogeniture, made
&s;uch a di&s;tinction between the families of the elder and
younger brothers, that the &s;on of the former was thought
intitled to &s;ucceed to his grandfather, preferably to his
<PB N="41" REF="50">
uncles, tho' nearer allied to the decea&s;ed monarch. But
tho' this progre&s;s of ideas was natural, it was gradual.
In the age of which we treat, the practice of repre&s;enta|tion
was indeed introduced, but not thoroughly e&s;ta|bli&s;hed;
and the minds of men floated between oppo&s;ite
principles. Richard, when he entered on the holy war,
declared his nephew, Arthur duke of Brittany, his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or;
and by a formal deed, he &s;et a&s;ide, in his favour,
the title of his brother John, who was younger than
Geoffrey, the father of that prince<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 677. M. Paris, p. 112. Chron. de Dun&s;t. p. 43. Rymer, vol. i. p. 66, 68. Bened. Abb. p. 619.</NOTE>. But John &s;o lit|tle
acquie&s;ced in this de&s;tination, that when he gained
the a&s;cendant in the Engli&s;h mini&s;try, by expelling
Longchamp, the chancellor and great ju&s;ticiary, he en|gaged
all the Engli&s;h barons to &s;wear, that they would
maintain his right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and Richard, on his
return, took no &s;teps towards re&s;toring or &s;ecuring the order
which he had at fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed. He was even
careful, by his la&s;t will, to declare his brother John heir
to all his dominions<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 791. Trivet, p. 138.</NOTE>; whether, that he now thought
Arthur, who was only twelve years of age, incapable of
a&s;&s;erting his claim again&s;t John's faction, or was influ|enced
by Eleanor, the Queen-mother, who hated Con|&s;tantia,
mother, to the young duke, and who dreaded
the influence which that prince&s;s would naturally acquire
during the reign of her &s;on. The authority of a te&s;ta|ment
was great in that age, even where the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
of a kingdom was concerned; and John had rea&s;on to
hope, that this title, joined to his plau&s;ible right in other
re&s;pects, would en&s;ure him the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. But the idea
of repre&s;entation &s;eems to have made, at this time, greater
progre&s;s in France than in England; and the barons of
the tran&s;marine provinces, Anjou, Maine, and Touraine,
<PB N="42" REF="51">
immediately declared in favour of Arthur's &s;ucce&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 792. M. Paris, p. 137. Matth. We&s;t. p. 263. Knyghton, p. 2414.</NOTE>,
and applied for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the French monarch as
their &s;uperior lord. Philip, who de&s;ired only an occa|&s;ion
to embara&s;s John, and di&s;member his dominions,
embraced the cau&s;e of the young duke of Brittany, took
him under his protection, and &s;ent him to Paris to be
educated, along with his &s;on Lewis<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. In this emer|gence,
John ha&s;tened to e&s;tabli&s;h his authority in the
chief members of the monarchy; and after &s;ending Ele|anor
into Poictou and Guienne, where her right was in|conte&s;tible,
and was readily acknowledged, he hurried to
Ro&uuml;en, and being there inve&s;ted in the dutchy of Nor|mandy,
he pa&s;&s;ed over without lo&s;s of time into Eng|land.
Hubert, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, William
Mare&s;chal, earl of Strigul, &s;oon after created earl of
Pembroke, and Geoffrey Fitz-Peter, the ju&s;ticiary, the
three mo&s;t favoured mini&s;ters of the late King, were
already engaged on his &s;ide<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 793. M. Paris, p. 137.</NOTE>; and the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion or ac|quie&s;cence
of all the other barons put him, without op|po&s;ition,
in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne.</P>
<P>THE King soon returned to France, in order to con|duct
the war again&s;t Philip, and to recover the revolted
provinces from his nephew, Arthur. The alliances
which Richard had formed with the earl of Flanders<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 114. Hoveden, p. 794. M. Paris, p. 138.</NOTE>,
and other potent French barons, tho' they had not been
very effectual, &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, and enabled John to defend
him&s;elf again&s;t all the efforts of his enemy. In an ac|tion
between the French and Flemings, the elect bi&s;hop
of Cambray was taken pri&s;oner by the former; and when
the cardinal of Capua claimed his liberty, Philip, in&s;tead
of complying, reproached him with the weak efforts
<PB N="43" REF="52">
which he had employed in favour of the bi&s;hop of Beau|vais,
who was in a like condition. The legate, to &s;how
his impartiality, laid at the &s;ame time the kingdom of
France and the dutchy of Normandy under an interdict;
and the two Kings found them&s;elves obliged to make an
exchange of the&s;e military prelates.</P>
<P>NOTHING enabled the King to bring this war to a
happy i&s;&s;ue &s;o much as the &s;elfi&s;h,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1200.</NOTE> intriguing character
of Philip, who acted, in the provinces that had declared
for Arthur, without any regard to the intere&s;ts of that
prince; and in&s;pired Con&s;tantia with a violent jealou&s;y,
that he intended to u&s;urp the entire dominion of them<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 795.</NOTE>.
She therefore found means to carry off her &s;on &s;ecretly
from Paris; &s;he put him into the hands of his uncle;
re&s;tored the provinces which had adhered to him; and
made him do homage for the dutchy of Brittany, which
was u&s;ually regarded as a rere-fief of Normandy. From
this incident, Philip &s;aw, that he could not hope to
make any progre&s;s again&s;t John; and being threatened
with an interdict on account of his irregular divorce
from Ingelburga, the Dani&s;h prince&s;s, whom he had e&s;|pou&s;ed,
he became very de&s;irous of concluding a peace
with England. After &s;ome fruitle&s;s conferences, the
terms were at la&s;t adju&s;ted; and the two monarchs &s;eem|ed
in this treaty to have an intention, be&s;ides ending
the pre&s;ent quarrel, of preventing all future cau&s;es of
di&s;cord, and of obviating every controver&s;y which could
hereafter ari&s;e between them. They adju&s;ted the limits
of all their territories; mutually &s;ecured the intere&s;ts of
their va&s;&s;als; and to render the union more durable,
John be&s;towed his niece, Blanche of Ca&s;tile, in marriage
to prince Lewis, Philip's elde&s;t &s;on, and gave with her
the baronies of I&s;&s;oudun and Gra&ccedil;ai, and other fiefs
<PB N="44" REF="53">
in Berri. Nine barons of the King of England, and as
many of the King of France, were guarantees of this
treaty; and all of them &s;wore, that, if their &s;overeign
violated any article of it, they would declare them&s;elves
again&s;t him, and embrace the cau&s;e of the injured mo|narch<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Norman. Duche&s;nii, p. 1055. Rymer, vol. i. p. 117, 118, 119. Hoveden, p. 814. Chron. Dun&s;t. vol. i. p. 47.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>JOHN,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's marriage.</NOTE> now &s;ecure, as he imagined, on the &s;ide of
France, indulged his pa&s;&s;ion towards I&s;abella, the daugh|ter

lady with whom he had become much enamoured. His
Queen, the heire&s;s of the family of Gloce&s;ter, was &s;till
alive: I&s;abella was married to the count de la Marche,
and was already delivered into the hands of that noble|man;
tho', by rea&s;on of her tender years, the marriage
was not yet con&s;ummated. The pa&s;&s;ion of John made
him overlook all the&s;e ob&s;tacles: He per&s;uaded the count
of Angouleme to carry off his daughter from her hu&s;|band;
and having, on &s;ome pretence or other, procured
a divorce from his own wife, he e&s;pou&s;ed I&s;abella<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 803. M. Paris, p. 140. Trivet, p. 140. Ann. Waverl. p. 166. Ypod Neu&s;t. p. 458. Ann. Murgan, p. 12. M. We&s;t. p. 263.</NOTE>, re|gardle&s;s
both of the menaces of the Pope, who exclaimed

his powerful and in&s;olent rival.</P>
<P>JOHN had not the art of attaching his barons either
by affection or by fear.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1201.</NOTE> The count de la Marche, and
his brother the count d'Eu, taking advantage of the ge|neral
di&s;content again&s;t him, excited commotions in Poic|tou
and Normandy; and obliged the King to have re|cour&s;e
to arms, in order to &s;uppre&s;s the in&s;urrection of
his va&s;&s;als. He &s;ummoned together the barons of Eng|land,
<PB N="45" REF="54">
and required them to pa&s;s the &s;eas under his
&s;tandard, and to quell the rebels: He found that he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
as little authority in that kingdom as in his tran&s;ma|rine
provinces. The Engli&s;h barons unanimou&s;ly repli|ed,
that they would not attend him on this expedition, un|le&s;s
he would promi&s;e to re&s;tore and pre&s;erve their privi|leges.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Annal. Burton, p. 262.</NOTE>:
The fir&s;t &s;ymptom of a regular a&s;&s;ociation and
plan of liberty among these noblemen! But affairs were
not yet fully ripe for the revolution projected. John, by
menacing the barons, broke the concert; and both en|gaged
many of them to follow him into Normandy, and
obliged the re&s;t, who &s;taid behind, to pay him a &s;cutage
of two marks on each knight's fee, as the price of their
exemption from the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>THE force which John carried abroad with him, and
that which joined him in Normandy, rendered him much
&s;uperior to his malecontent barons; and &s;o much the
more, as Philip gave them not publicly any countenance,
and &s;eemed as yet determined to per&s;evere &s;teadily in the
union which he had formed with England. But the
King, elated with his &s;uperiority, advanced claims,
which gave an univer&s;al alarm to his va&s;&s;als, and dif|fu&s;ed
&s;till wider the general di&s;content. As the juri&s;|prudence
of that time required, that the cau&s;es in the
lord's court &s;hould chiefly be decided by duel, he carried
along with him certain bravos, whom he retained as
champions, and whom he de&s;tined to fight with his ba|rons,
in order to determine any controver&s;y which he
might rai&s;e again&s;t them<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Annal. Burt. p. 262.</NOTE>. The count de la Marche,
and the other noblemen, regarded this proceeding as an
affront, as well as an injury; and declared, that they
would never draw their &s;words again&s;t men of &s;uch infe|rior
quality. The King menaced them with vengeance;
but he had not vigour to employ again&s;t them the force in
<PB N="46" REF="55">
his hands, or to pro&s;ecute the inju&s;tice, by cru&s;hing in|tirely
the nobles who oppo&s;ed it.</P>
<P>THIS government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with France.</NOTE> equally feeble and violent, gave
courage as well as inclination to the injured barons to
carry farther their oppo&s;ition: They appealed to the King
of France; complained of the denial of ju&s;tice in John's
courts; demanded redre&s;s from him as their &s;uperior lord;
and entreated him to employ his authority, and prevent
their final ruin and oppre&s;&s;ion. Philip perceived his ad|vantage,
opened his mind to great projects, interpo&s;ed in
behalf of the French barons, and began to talk in a high
and menacing &s;tyle to the King of England.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1202.</NOTE> John,
who could not di&s;avow Philip's authority, replied, that
it belonged to him fir&s;t to grant them a trial by their
peers in his own court; it was not till he failed in this
duty, that he was an&s;werable to his peers in the &s;upreme
court of the French King<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Philipp. lib. 6.</NOTE>; and he promi&s;ed, by a fair
and equitable judicature, to give &s;atisfaction to his barons.
When the nobles, in con&s;equence of this engagement,
demanded a &s;afe-conduct, that they might attend his court,
he fir&s;t refu&s;ed it: Upon the renewal of Philip's mena|ces,
he promi&s;ed to grant their demand; he violated this
promi&s;e; fre&s;h menaces extorted from him a promi&s;e to
&s;urrender to Philip the fortre&s;&s;es of Tillieres and Bouta|vant,
as a &s;ecurity for performance; he violated again
this engagement; his enemies, &s;en&s;ible both of his weak|ness
and want of faith, combined &s;till clo&s;er in the re&s;o|lution
of pu&s;hing him to extremities; and a new and
powerful ally &s;oon appeared to encourage them in their
inva&s;ion of this odious and de&s;picable government.</P>
<P>THE young duke of Brittany,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1203.</NOTE> who was now ri&s;ing
to man's e&s;tate, &s;en&s;ible of the dangerous character of
his uncle, determined to &s;eek both his &s;ecurity and ad|vancement
<PB N="47" REF="56">
by an union with Philip and the malecontent
barons. He joined the French army, which had begun
ho&s;tilities again&s;t the King of England: He was received
with great marks of di&s;tinction by Philip; was knighted
by him; e&s;pou&s;ed his daughter Mary; and was inve&s;ted
not only in the dutchy of Brittany, but in the counties
of Anjou and Maine, which he had formerly re&s;igned to
his uncle<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. 142.</NOTE>. Every attempt &s;ucceeded with the allies.
Tillieres and Boutavant were taken by Philip, after
making a feeble defence: Mortimar and Lyons fell into
his hands almo&s;t without re&s;i&s;tance. That prince next
inve&s;ted Gournai; and opening the &s;luices of a lake,
which lay in the neighbourhood, poured &s;uch a torrent
of water into the place, that the garri&s;on de&s;erted it, and
the French monarch, without &s;triking a blow, made
him&s;elf ma&s;ter of that important$ fortre&s;s. The progre&s;s
of the French arms was rapid, and promi&s;ed more con|&s;iderable
&s;ucce&s;s than u&s;ually in that age attended mili|tary
enterprizes. In an&s;wer to every advance which the
King of England made towards peace, Philip &s;till in|&s;i&s;ted,
that he &s;hould re&s;ign all his tran&s;marine dominions
to his nephew, and re&s;t contented with the kingdom
of England; when an event happened, which &s;eemed
to turn the &s;cales in John's favour, and to give him a de|ci&s;ive
&s;uperiority over his enemies.</P>
<P>YOUNG Arthur, fond of military renown, had broke
into Poictou at the head of a &s;mall army; and pa&s;&s;ing
near Mirabel, he heard, that his grandmother, Queen
Eleanor, who had always oppo&s;ed his intere&s;ts, was
lodged in that place, and was protected by a weak gar|ri&s;on,
and ruinous fortifications<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ann. Waverl. p. 167. M. We&s;t. p. 264.</NOTE>. He immediately de|termined
to lay &s;iege to the fortre&s;s, and make him&s;elf
ma&s;ter of her per&s;on: But John, rouzed from his indo|lence
<PB N="48" REF="57">
by &s;o pre&s;&s;ing an occa&s;ion, collected an army of
Engli&s;h and Braban&ccedil;ons, and advanced from Normandy
with ha&s;ty marches to the relief of the Queen-mother.
He fell on Arthur's camp before that prince was aware
of the danger; di&s;per&s;ed his army; took him pri&s;oner,
together with the count de la Marche, Geoffrey de Lu|&s;ignan,
and the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the revolted barons;
and returned in triumph to Normandy<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ann. Marg. p. 213. M. We&s;t. p. 264.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1&s;t Augu&s;t.</NOTE> Philip, who
was lying before Arques in that dutchy, rai&s;ed the &s;iege,

the pri&s;oners were &s;ent over to England; but Arthur
was &s;hut up in the ca&s;tle of Falai&s;e.</P>
<P>THE King had here a conference with his nephew; re|pre&s;ented
to him the folly of his preten&s;ions; and re|quired
him to renounce the French alliance, which had
encouraged him to enter into enmity again&s;t all his fa|mily:
But the brave youth, rendered more haughty from
misfortunes, maintained the ju&s;tice of his cau&s;e; a&s;&s;erted
his claim, not only to the French provinces, but to the
crown of England; and in his turn, required the King
to re&s;tore the &s;on of his elder brother to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
his inheritance. John, &s;en&s;ible, from the&s;e &s;ymptoms
of &s;pirit, that the young prince, tho' now a pri&s;oner,
might &s;ome time prove a mo&s;t dangerous enemy, deter|mined
to prevent all future peril by di&s;patching his ne|phew;
and Arthur was never more heard of.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Murder of Arthur, duke of Brittany.</NOTE> The cir|cum&s;tances
which attended this deed of darkne&s;s, were,
no doubt, carefully concealed by the actors, and are va|riou&s;ly
related by hi&s;torians: But the mo&s;t probable ac|count
is as follows. The King, it is &s;aid, fir&s;t propo&s;|ed
to William de la Braye, one of his &s;ervants, to di&s;|patch
Arthur; but William replied, that he was a gen|tleman,
not a hangman; and he po&s;itively refu&s;ed com|pliance.
<PB N="49" REF="58">
Another in&s;trument of murder was found, and
was di&s;patched with proper orders to Falai&s;e; but Hu|bert
de Bourg, chamberlain to the King, and con&s;table of the ca&s;tle,
feigning, that he him&s;elf would execute
the King's mandate, &s;ent back the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, &s;pread the re|port
that the young prince was dead, and publicly per|formed
all the ceremonies of his interment: But finding,
that the Bretons vowed vengeance for the murder, and
that all the revolted barons per&s;evered more ob&s;tinately
in their rebellion, he thought it prudent to reveal the &s;e|cret,
and to inform the world that the duke of Brittany
was &s;till alive, and in his cu&s;tody. This di&s;covery proved
fatal to the young prince: John fir&s;t removed him to the
ca&s;tle of Ro&uuml;en; and coming in a boat, during the night|time,
to that place, commanded Arthur to be brought
forth to him. The young prince, aware of his danger,
and now more &s;ubdued by the continuance of his misfor|tunes,
and by the approach of death, threw him&s;elf on
his knees before his uncle, and begged for mercy: But
the barbarous tyrant, making no reply, &s;tabbed him with
his own hands; and fa&s;tening a &s;tone to the dead body,
threw it into the Seine.</P>
<P>THE whole world was &s;truck with horror it his inhu|man
deed; and from that moment, the King, dete&s;ted by
his &s;ubjects, retained a very precarious authority over both
the people and the barons in his dominions. The Bre|tons,
enraged at this di&s;appointment in their fond hopes,
waged implacable war again&s;t him; and fixing the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
of their government, put them&s;elves in a po&s;ture
to revenge the murder of their &s;overeign. Johh had got
into his power his niece, Eleanor, &s;i&s;ter to Arthur,
commonly called <HI>the dam&s;el of Brittany;</HI> and carrying her
over to England, detained her ever after in captivity<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. 145. T. Wykes, p. 36. Ypod Neu&s;t. p. 459.</NOTE>:

murdered prince, &s;econded by all the &s;tates of Brittany,

who, notwith&s;tanding the homage which he did to Nor|mandy,
was always regarded as one of the chief va&s;&s;als
of the crown. Philip received their application with

and on his non-appearance, pa&s;&s;ed &s;entence, with the
concurrence of the peers, upon that prince; declared

up all the places under his command to the
French King: Upon which, Philip &s;eparated his army,
in order to give them &s;ome repo&s;e after the fatigues of
the campaign. John, &s;uddenly collecting &s;ome troops,
laid &s;iege to Alen&ccedil;on; and Philip, who&s;e di&s;per&s;ed army,
could not be brought together in time to &s;uccour it, &s;aw
him&s;elf expo&s;ed to the di&s;grace of &s;uffering the oppre&s;|&s;ion
of his friend and confederate. But his active and
fertile genius found an expedient again&s;t this evil. There
was held at that very time a tournament at Moret in the
Gatinois; whither all the chief nobility of France and
the neighbouring countries had re&s;orted, in order to &s;ig|nalize
their courage and addre&s;s. Philip pre&s;ented him|&s;elf
before them; craved their a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his di&s;tre&s;s;
and pointed out the plains of Alen&ccedil;on as the mo&s;t ho|nourable
field, in which they could di&s;play their genero|&s;ity
and martial &s;pirit. The&s;e valorous knights vowed,
that they would take vengeance on the ba&s;e parricide,
the &s;tain of arms and of chivalry; and putting them|&s;elves,
with all their retinue, under the command of
Philip, in&s;tantly marched to rai&s;e the &s;iege of Alen&ccedil;on.
John, hearing of their approach, fled from before the
place; and in the hurry abandoned all his tents, machines,
and baggage, to the enemy.</P>
<P>THIS feeble effort was the la&s;t exploit of that &s;lothful
and cowardly prince for the defence of his dominions.
He thenceforth remained in total inactivity at Ro&uuml;en;
and pa&s;&s;ed all his time, with his young wife, in pa&s;times
and amu&s;ements, as if his &s;tate had been in the mo&s;t
<PB N="52" REF="61">
profound tranquillity, or his affairs in the mo&s;t pro&s;perous
condition. If he ever mentioned war, it was only to
give him&s;elf vaunting airs, which, in the eyes of all
men of &s;en&s;e, rendered him &s;till more de&s;picable and ri|diculous.
<HI>Let the French go on,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>I will retake in a
day what has co&s;t them years to acquire</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 146. M. We&s;t. p. 266.</NOTE>. His &s;tupidity and
indolence appeared &s;o extraordinary, that the people en|deavoured
to account for the infatuation by &s;orcery, and
believed, that he was thrown into this lethargy by &s;ome
magic or witchcraft. The English barons, finding that
their time was wa&s;ted to no purpo&s;e, and that they mu&s;t
&s;uffer the di&s;grace of &s;eeing; without re&s;i&s;tance, the pro|gre&s;s
of the French arms, withdrew from their co|lours,
and &s;ecretly returned to their own country<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 146. M. We&s;t. p. 246.</NOTE>. No
one thought of defending a man, who &s;eemed to have
de&s;erted him&s;elf; and his &s;ubjects looked on his fate with
the &s;ame indifference, to which, in this pre&s;&s;ing exigen|cy,
they &s;aw him totally abandoned.</P>
<P>JOHN, while he neglected all dome&s;tic re&s;ources for
his &s;afety, had the meanne&s;s to betake him&s;elf to a fo|reign
power, who&s;e protection he claimed: He applied
to the Pope, Innocent III. and entreated him to inter|po&s;e
with his authority between him and the French monarch.
Innocent, plea&s;ed with any occa&s;ion of exert|ing
his &s;uperiority, &s;ent Philip orders to &s;top the progre&s;s
of his arms, and to make peace with the King of Eng|land.
But the French barons received this me&s;&s;age with
indignation; di&s;claimed the temporal authority challenged
by the pontiff; and vowed, that they would, to the ut|termo&s;t,
a&s;&s;i&s;t their prince again&s;t all his enemies: And
Philip, &s;econding their ardour, proceeded, in&s;tead of
obeying the Pope's envoys, to lay &s;iege to Chateau Gail|lard,
the mo&s;t con&s;iderable fortre&s;s which remained to
guard the frontiers of Normandy.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="62">
CHATEAU GAILLARD was &s;ituated, partly on an i&s;land
in the river Seine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1204.</NOTE> partly on a rock oppo&s;ite to it; and was
&s;ecured by every advantage, which either art or nature
could b$$$ow upon it. The late King, having ca&s;t his
eye on this favourable &s;ituation, had &s;pared no labour nor
expence in fortifying it; and it was defended by Roger
de Laci, con&s;table of Che&s;ter, a determined officer, at
the head of a numerous garri&s;on. Philip, who de&s;paired
of taking the place by force, propo&s;ed to &s;ubdue it by
famine; and that he might cut off its communication
with the neighbouring country, he threw a bridge acro&s;s
the Seine, while he himself with, his army blockaded it
by land. The earl of Pembroke, the man of greate&s;t
vigour and capacity in the Engli&s;h court, formed a plan
for breaking thro' the French entrenchments, and throw|ing
relief into the place. He carried with him an army
of 4000 infantry and 3000 cavalry, and &s;uddenly at|tacked,
with great &s;ucce&s;s, Philip's camp in the night
time; having left orders, that a fleet of &s;eventy flat-bot|tomed
ve&s;&s;els &s;hould &s;ail up the Seine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1205.</NOTE> and fall at the
&s;ame in&s;tant on the bridge. But the wind and the current
of the river, by retarding the ve&s;&s;els, di&s;concerted this
plan of operations; and it was morning before the fleet
appeared; when Pembroke, tho' &s;ucce&s;sful in the begin|ning
of the action, was already repul&s;ed with con&s;idera|ble
lo&s;s, and the French King had lei&s;ure to defend
him&s;elf against the&s;e new a&s;&s;ailants, who were repul&s;ed
in their turn. After this misfortune, John made no far|ther
efforts for the relief of Chateau Gaillard; and Phi|lip
had all the lei&s;ure requi&s;ite for conducting and fini&s;h|ing
the &s;iege. Roger de Laci defended him&s;elf for a
twelvemonth with great ob&s;tinacy; and having bravely
repulsed every attack, and patiently born all the hard|&s;hips
of famine, he was at la&s;t overpowered by a &s;udden
a&s;&s;ault in the night-time, and made pri&s;oner of war, with
<PB N="54" REF="63">
his whole garri&s;on<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. 144. Gul. Britto, lib. 7. Ann. Waverl. p. 168.</NOTE>. Philip, who knew how to re&s;pect
valour even in an enemy, treated him with the utmo&s;t ci|vility;
and gave him the whole city of Paris for the
place of his confinement.</P>
<P>WHEN this bulwark of Normandy was once &s;ubdued,
all the province lay open to the inroads of Philip; and
the King of England de&s;paired of being any longer able
to defend it. He &s;ecretly prepared ve&s;&s;els for a &s;canda|lous
flight; and that the Normans might no longer
doubt of his re&s;olution to abandon them, he ordered the
fortifications of Pont de I'Arche, Moulineaux, and Mont|fort
l'Amauri to be demoli&s;hed. Not daring to repo&s;e
confidence in any of his barons, whom he believed to be
univer&s;ally engaged in a con&s;piracy again&s;t him, he en|tru&s;ted
the government of the province to Archas Martin
and Lupicaire, two mercenary Braban&ccedil;ons, whom he
had retained in his &s;ervice. Philip, now &s;ecure of his
prey, pu&s;hed his conque&s;ts with vigour and &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t
the di&s;mayed Normans. Falai&s;e was fir&s;t be&s;ieged; and
Lupicaire, who commanded in this impregnable fortre&s;s,
after &s;urrendering the place, ba&s;ely inli&s;ted himself with
his troops in the &s;ervice of Philip, and carried on hosti|lities
again&s;t his antient ma&s;ter. Caen, Cautance, Seez,
Evreux, Ba&iuml;eux &s;oon fell into the hands of the French
monarch, and all the lower Normandy was reduced un|der
his dominion. To forward his enterprizes on the
other divi&s;ion of the province, Gui de Thouars, at the
head of the Bretons, broke into the territory, and took
Mount St. Michael, Avranches, and all the other for|tre&s;&s;es
in that neighbourhood. The Normans, who ab|horred
the French yoke, and who would have defended
them&s;elves to the la&s;t extremity, if their prince had ap|peared
to conduct them, found no re&s;ource but in &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion;
and every city opened its gates, as &s;oon as Philip ap|peared
<PB N="55" REF="64">
before it. Ro&uuml;en alone, Arques and Verne&uuml;il de|termined
to maintain their liberties; and formed a con|federacy
together for mutual defence. Philip began with
the attack of Ro&uuml;en; and the inhabitants were &s;o in|flamed
with hatred to France, that, on the appearance
of his army, they fell on all the natives of that country,
whom they found within their walls, and put them to
death. But after the French King had begun his ope|rations
with &s;ucce&s;s, and had taken &s;ome of their
outworks, the citizens, &s;eeing no re&s;ource, offered to
capitulate;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1&s;t June.</NOTE> and demanded only thirty days to adverti&s;e
their prince of their danger, and to require &s;uccours
again&s;t the enemy. Upon the expiration of the term,
as no &s;upply had arrived, they opened their gates to Phi|lip<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. 147. Ypod. Neu&s;t. p. 459.</NOTE>;
and the whole province &s;oon after imitated their
example, and &s;ubmitted to the victor. Thus was this
important territory re-united to the crown of France,
near three centuries after the ce&s;&s;ion of it by Charles the
Simple to Rollo, the fir&s;t duke: And the Normans,
&s;en&s;ible that this conque&s;t was probably final, demanded
the privilege of being governed by French laws; which
Philip, making a few alterations on the antient Norman
cu&s;toms, readily granted them. But the French monarch
had too much ambition and genius to &s;top in his
pre&s;ent career of &s;ucce&s;s. He carried his victorious army
into the we&s;tern provinces; &s;oon reduced Anjou, Maine,
Touraine, and part of Poictou under his dominion<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. 149.</NOTE>;
and in this manner, the French crown, during the reign
of one able and active prince; received &s;uch an acce&s;&s;ion
of power and grandeur; as, in the ordinary cour&s;e of
things, would have required it &s;everal ages to acquire.</P>
<P>JOHN, on his arrival in England, that he might cover
the di&s;grace of his own conduct, exclaimed loudly against
<PB N="56" REF="65">
his barons, who, he pretended, had de&s;erted his &s;tandard
in Normandy; and he arbitrarily extorted from them a
&s;eventh part of all their moveables, as a punishment for
this offence<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, 146. M. We&s;t. p. 265.</NOTE>. Soon after he forced them to grant him a
&s;cutage of two marks and a half on each knight's &s;ee for
an expedition into Normandy; but he did not attempt
to execute the &s;ervice, for which he pretended to exact it.
Next year, he &s;ummoned all the barons of his realm to
attend him on this foreign expedition, and collected the
&s;hips from all the &s;ea-ports; but meeting with oppo&s;ition
from &s;ome of his mini&s;ters, and repenting him of his
de&s;ign, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed both fleet and army, and then re|newed
his exclamations again&s;t the barons for de&s;erting
him. He next put to &s;ea with a &s;mall army, and his
&s;ubject believed, that he was re&s;olved to expo&s;e him&s;lef
to the utmo&s;t hazards for the defence and recovery of his
dominions; But they were &s;urprized, after a few days, to
&s;ee him return again into harbour, without attempting
any thing.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1206.</NOTE> In the &s;ub&s;equent &s;ea&s;on, he had the cou|rage
to carry his ho&s;tile mea&s;ures a &s;tep farther. Guide
Thouars, who governed Brittany, being jealous of the
rapid progre&s;s, made by his ally, the French King, pro|mi&s;ed
to join the King of England, with all his forces;
and John ventured abroad with a con&s;iderable army, and
landed at Rochelle. He marched to Angers; which he
took and reduced to a&s;hes. But the approach of Philip
with an army threw him into terrors; and he immedi|ately
made propo&s;als of peace, and fixed a place of in|terview
with his enemy: But in&s;tead of keeping this en|gagement,
he &s;tole off with his army, embarked at Ro|chelle,
and returned, loaded with new &s;hame and di&s;|grace,
into England. The mediation of the Pope pro|cured
him at la&s;t a truce for two years with the
<PB N="57" REF="66">
French monarch<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 141.</NOTE>; almost all the tran&s;marine provinces
were ravi&s;hed from him; and his Engli&s;h barons, tho'
hara&s;&s;ed with arbitrary taxes and fruitle&s;s expeditions,
&s;aw them&s;elves and their country baffled and, affronted in
every enterprize.</P>
<P>IN an age, when per&s;onal valour was regarded as the
chief accompli&s;hment, &s;uch conduct as that of John, dis|graceful
at any time, mu&s;t be expo&s;ed to peculiar con|tempt;
and he could thenceforth expect to rule his tur|bulent
va&s;&s;als with a very doubtful authority. But the
government, exerci&s;ed by the Norman princes, had
wound up the royal power to &s;o high a pitch, and &s;o
much beyond the u&s;ual tenor of the feudal con&s;titutions,
that it behoved him to be deba&s;ed by new affronts and
di&s;graces, ere his barons could entertain the views of
con&s;piring again&s;t him, in order to retrench his exorbi|tant
prerogatives. The church, which, at that time,
declined not a conte&s;t with the mo&s;t powerful and vigor|ous
monarchs, took fir&s;t advantage of John's imbecillity;
and with the mo&s;t aggravating circum&s;tances of in&s;olence
and &s;corn, fixed her yoke upon him.</P>
<P>THE papal chair was then filled by Innocent III.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1207.</NOTE>
who, having attained that dignity at the age of thirty|&s;even
years, and being endowed with a lofty and enter|prizing
genius,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's quarrel with the court of France.</NOTE> gave full &s;cope to his ambition, and attempt|ted,
perhaps more openly than any of his predece&s;&s;ors, to
convert that &s;uperiority, which was yielded him by all
the European princes, into a real dominion over them.
The hierarchy, protected by the Roman pontiff, had al|ready
carried to an enormous height its u&s;urpations upon
the civil power; but in order to extend them farther,
and render them u&s;eful to the court of Rome, it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary

to reduce the eccle&s;ia&s;tics them&s;elves under an ab|&s;olute
monarchy, and to make them entirely dependant
on their &s;piritual leader. For this purpo&s;e, Innocent
fir&s;t attempted to impo&s;e taxes at plea&s;ure upon the cler|gy;
and in the fir&s;t year of this century, taking advan|tage
of the popular frenzy for cru&s;ades, he &s;ent collectors
over all Europe, who levied by his authority the for|tieth
of all eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues, for the relief of the
holy land, and received the voluntary contributions of
the laity to a like amount<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 119.</NOTE>. The &s;ame year Hubert,
archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, attempted another innovation,
favourable to eccle&s;ia&s;tical and papal power: In the
King's ab&s;ence, be &s;ummoned, by his legantine authori|ty,
a &s;ynod of all the Engli&s;h clergy, contrary to the
prohibition of Geoffrey Fitz-Peter, the chief ju&s;ticiary;
and no proper cen&s;ure was ever pa&s;&s;ed on this encroach|ment,
the fir&s;t of the kind, upon the royal power. But
a favourable incident &s;oon after happened, which en|abled
&s;o a&s;piring a pontiff as Innocent, to extend &s;till
farther his u&s;urpations on &s;o contemptible a prince as
John.</P>
<P>HUBERT, the primate, died in 1205; and as the
monks or canons of Chri&s;t-church, Canterbury, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed
a right of voting in the election of their archbi&s;hop,
&s;ome of the juniors of the order, who lay in wait for
that event, met clande&s;tinely the very night of Hubert's
death; and without any cong&eacute; d'elire from the King,
cho&s;e Reginald, their &s;ub-prior, for the &s;ucce&s;&s;or; in|&s;talled
him in the archi-epi&s;copal throne before midnight;
and having enjoined him the &s;tricte&s;t &s;ecrecy, &s;ent him
immediately to Rome, in order to &s;olicit the confirma|tion
of his election<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 148. M. We&s;t. p. 266.</NOTE>. The vanity of Reginald prevailed
over his policy; and he no &s;ooner arrived in Flanders,
<PB N="59" REF="70">
than he revealed to every one the purpo&s;e of his journey,
which was immediately known in England<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 148. M. We&s;t. p. 266.</NOTE>. The King
was enraged at the novelty and temerity of the attempt,
in filling &s;o important an office without his knowledge or
con&s;ent: The &s;uffragan bi&s;hops of Canterbury, who
were accu&s;tomed to concur in the choice of their pri|mate,
were no le&s;s di&s;plea&s;ed at the exclu&s;ion given them
in this election: The elder monks of Chri&s;t church
were injured by the irregular proceedingsof their juni|ors:
The juniors them&s;elves, a&s;hamed of their conduct,
and di&s;gu&s;ted with the levity of Reginald, who had broke
his engagement with them, were willing to &s;et a&s;ide his
election<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">M. We&s;t. p. 266.</NOTE>: And all men concurred in the de&s;ign of reme|dying
the fal&s;e mea&s;ures, which had been taken, But
as John knew, that this affair would be canva&s;&s;ed before
a &s;uperior tribunal, where the interpo&s;ition of royal au|thority,
in be&s;towing eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices, was very
invidious; where even the cau&s;e of &s;uffragan bi&s;hops
was not &s;o favourable as that of monks; he determined
to make the new election entirely unexceptionable: He
&s;ubmitted the affair wholly to the canons of Chri&s;t-church;
and, departing from the right, claimed by his
predece&s;&s;ors, ventured no farther than to inform them
privately, that they would do him an acceptable piece of
&s;ervice, if they cho&s;e John de Gray, bi&s;hop of Norwich,
for their primate<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">M, Paris, P. 149. M. We&s;t. p. 266.</NOTE>. The election of that prelate was
accordingly made without a contradictory vote; and the
King, to obviate all conte&s;ts, endeavoured to per&s;uade
the &s;uffragan bi&s;hops not to in&s;i&s;t on their right of con|curring
in the election: But the&s;e prelates, per&s;evering
in their preten&s;ions, &s;ent an agent to maintain their cau&s;e
before Innocent; while the King, and the convent
of Chri&s;t-church, di&s;patched twelve monks of that order to
<PB N="60" REF="71">
&s;upport, before the &s;ame tribunal, the election of the
bishop of Norwich.</P>
<P>THUS, there lay three different claims before the
Pope, whom all parties allowed to be the &s;upreme arbiter
of the conte&s;t. The claim of the &s;uffragans, being &s;o
opposite to the u&s;ual maxims of the papal court, was
&s;oon &s;et a&s;ide: The election of Reginald was &s;o obviou&s;|ly
fraudulent and irregular, that there was no po&s;&s;ibitity
of defending it: But Innocent maintained, that, tho'
this election was null and invalid, it ought previou&s;ly to
have been declared &s;uch by the &s;overeign pontiff, before
the monks could proceed to a new election; and that the
choice of the bishop of Norwich was of cour&s;e as unca|nonical
as that of his competitor<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 155. Chron. de Mailr. p. 182.</NOTE>. Advantage was,
therefore, taken of this &s;ubtlety for introducing a prece|dent,
by which the fee of Canterbury, the mo&s;t import|ant
dignity in the church after the papal throne, &s;hould
be ever after at the di&s;po&s;al of the court of Rome.</P>
<P>WHILE the Pope maintained &s;o many fierce conte&s;ts,
in order to wreft from princes the right of granting in|ve&s;titures,
and to exclude laymen from all authority of
conferring eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices, he was &s;upported by
the united influence of the clergy, who, a&s;piring to in|dependance
fought, with all the ardour of ambition,
and all the zeal of &s;uper&s;tition, under his &s;acred banners.
But no &s;ooner was this point, after a great effu&s;ion of
blood and the convul&s;ions of many &s;tates, e&s;tabli&s;hed in
&s;ome tolerable degree, than the victorious leader, as is
u&s;ual, turned his arms again&s;t his own community, and
a&s;pired to center all power in his per&s;on. By the inven|tion
of re&s;erves, provi&s;ions, commendams, and other
devices, the Pope gradually a&s;&s;umed the right of filling
vacant benefices; and the plenitude of his apo&s;tolic
power, which was not &s;ubject to any limitations, &s;uppli|ed
<PB N="61" REF="72">
all defects of title in the per&s;on on whom he be&s;towed
preferment. The canons which regulated elections were
purpo&s;ely rendered intricate and involved: Frequent di&s;|putes
aro&s;e among candidates: Appeals were every day
carried to Rome: The apo&s;tolic &s;ee, be&s;ides reaping pe|cuniary
advantages from the&s;e conte&s;ts, often exerci&s;ed
the power of &s;etting a&s;ide both the litigants, and on pre|tence
of appea&s;ing faction, nominated a third per&s;on,
who might be more acceptable to the contending parties.</P>
<P>THE pre&s;ent controver&s;y about the election to the &s;ee
of Canterbury afforded Innocent an opportunity of claim|ing
this right; and he failed not to perceive and avail
him&s;elf of his advantage. He &s;ent for the twelve monks
deputed by the convent to maintain the cau&s;e of the bi|&s;hop
of Norwich: and commanded them, under the pe|nalty
of excommunication, to chu&s;e for their primate,
cardinal Langton, an Engli&s;hman by birth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cardinal Langton appointed archbi&s;hop of canter|bury</NOTE> but educated
in France, and connected, by his intere&s;ts and attach|ments,
with the &s;ee of Rome<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 155. Ann. Waverl. p. 169. W. Heming, p. 553. Knyghton, p. 2415.</NOTE>. In vain did the monks
repre&s;ent, that they had received from their convent no
authority for this purpo&s;e; that an election, without a
previous writ from the King, would be deemed highly
irregular; and that they were merely agents for another
person, who&s;e right they had no power nor pretence to
abandon. None of them had the courage to per&s;evere in
this oppo&s;ition, except one, Elias de Brantefield: All
the re&s;t, overcome by the menaces and authority of the
Pope, complied with his orders, and made the election
required of them.</P>
<P>INNOCENT, &s;en&s;ible that this flagrant u&s;urpation would
be highly re&s;ented by the court of England, wrote John
a mollifying letter; &s;ent him four golden rings &s;et with
<PB N="62" REF="73">
precious &s;tones; and endeavoured to enhance the value
of his pre&s;ent, by informing him of the many my&s;teries
which were implied in it. He begged him to con&s;ider &s;e|riou&s;ly

endeavoured to repay John for one of the mo&s;t important
prerogatives of his crown, which he had ravi&s;hed
from him; conceits probably admired by Innocent him|self.
For it is ea&s;ily po&s;&s;ible for a man, e&s;pecially in a
barbarous age, to unite &s;trong talents for bu&s;ine&s;s with
an ab&s;urd ta&s;te in &s;cience and the arts.</P>
<P>JOHN was inflamed with the utmo&s;t rage, when he
heard of this attempt of the court of Rome<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 143.</NOTE>; and he
immediately vented his pa&s;&s;ion on the monks of Chri&s;t-church,
whom he found inclined to &s;upport the election
made by their brethren at Rome. He &s;ent Fulk de Can|telupe,
and Henry de Cornhulle, two knights of his
train, men of violent tempers and rude manners, to ex|pel
them the convent, and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their reve|nues
<PB N="63" REF="74">
The&s;e knights entered the mona&s;tery with drawn
&s;words, command$d the prior and the monks to depart
the kingdom, and menaced them, that, in ca&s;e of di&s;|obedience,
they would in&s;tantly burn them with the con|vent<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 156. Trivet, p. 151. Ann. Waverl. p. 169.</NOTE>.
Innocent, progno&s;ticating, from the violence
and imprudence of the&s;e mea&s;ures, that John would
finally &s;ink in the conte&s;t, per&s;evered the more vigorou&s;|ly
in his preten&s;ions, and exhorted the King not to op|po&s;e
God and the church any longer, nor to per&s;ecute
that cau&s;e for which the holy martyr, St. Thomas, had
&s;acrificed his life, and which had exalted him equal to
the highe&s;t &s;aints in heavens<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 157.</NOTE>: A &s;ufficient hint to John
to profit by the example of his father, and to remember
the prejudices and e&s;tabli&s;hed principles of his &s;ubjects,
who bore a profound veneration to that martyr, and re|garded
his merits as the &s;ubjects of their chief glory and
exultation.</P>
<P>THE pontiff, finding that John was not yet &s;ufficient|ly
tamed to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, &s;ent three prelates, the bi&s;hops
of London, Ely, and Worce&s;ter, to intimate to him,
that, if he per&s;evered in his di&s;obedience, Innocent
would be obliged to put the kingdom under the &s;entence
of interdict<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. All the other prelates threw them&s;elves
on their knees before him; and entreated him, with tears
in their eyes, to prevent the &s;candal of this &s;entence, by
making a &s;peedy &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his &s;piritual Father, by re|ceiving
from his hands the new elected primate, and by
re&s;toring the monks of Chri&s;t-church to all their rights
and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. He bur&s;t out into the mo&s;t indecent in|vectives
again&s;t the prelates; &s;wore by God's teeth, his
u&s;ual oath, that if the Pope pre&s;umed to put his king|dom
under an interdict, he would &s;end to him all the bi|&s;hops
and clergy of England, and would confi&s;cate all
<PB N="64" REF="75">
their e&s;tates; and threatened, that, if thenceforth he
caught any Romans in his dominions, he would put out
their eyes, and cut off their no&s;es, in order to &s;et a mark
upon them, which might di&s;tingui&s;h them from all other
nations<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. Amid&s;t all this idle violence, John &s;tood on
&s;uch bad terms with his nobility, that he never dared to
a&s;&s;emble the &s;tates of the kingdom, who, in &s;o ju&s;t a
cau&s;e, would probably have adhered to any other mo|narch,
and have defended with vigour the liberties of
the nation again&s;t the&s;e palpable u&s;urpations of the court
of Rome. Innocent, therefore, perceiving the King's
weakne&s;s, i&s;&s;ued at la&s;t the &s;entence of interdict, which
he had for &s;ome time held &s;u&s;pended over him<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Paris, p. 157. Trivet, p. 152. Ann. Waverl. p. 170. M. We&s;t. p. 268&punc;</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE &s;entence of interdict was at that time the great
in&s;trument of vengeance and policy employed by the
Court of Rome; was pronounced again&s;t &s;overeigns for
the lighte&s;t offences; and made the guilt of one per|&s;on
involve the ruin of millions, even in their &s;piritual
and eternal welfare. The execution of it was artificial|ly
calculated to &s;trik$ the &s;en&s;es in the highe&s;t degree,
and to operate with irre&s;i&s;tible force on the &s;uper&s;titious
minds of the people. The nation was of a &s;udden de|prived
of all exterior exerci&s;e of its religion: The altars
were de&s;poiled of their ornaments: The cro&s;&s;es, the re|liques,
the images, the &s;tatues of the &s;aints were laid on
the ground; and as if the air it&s;elf were profaned, and
might pollute them by its contact, the prie&s;ts carefully
covered them up, even from their own approach and ve|neration.
The u&s;e of bells entirely cea&s;ed in all the
churches: The bells them&s;elves were removed from the
&s;teeples, and laid on the ground with the other &s;acred
uten&s;ils. Ma&s;s was celebrated with &s;hut doors; and
none but the prie&s;ts were admitted to that holy in&s;titu|tion,
<PB N="65" REF="76">
The laity partook of no religious rite, except
bapti&s;m to new-born infants, and the communion to the
dying: The dead were not interred in con&s;ecrated
ground: They were thrown into ditches, or buried in
common fields; and their ob&s;equies were not attended
with prayers or any hallowed ceremony. Marriage was
celebrated in the church-yards<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 51.</NOTE>; and that every action
in life might bear the marks of this dreadful &s;ituation, the
people were prohibited the u&s;e of meat, as in Lent, or
times of the highe&s;t penance; were debarred from all
plea&s;ures and entertainments; and were forbid even to
&s;alute each other, or &s;o much as to &s;have their beards,
and give any decent attention to their per&s;on and apparel.
Every circum&s;tance carried the &s;ymptoms of the deepe&s;t
di&s;tre&s;s, and of the mo&s;t immediate apprehen&s;ions of di|vine
vengeance and indignation.</P>
<P>THE King, that he might oppo&s;e <HI>his</HI> temporal to <HI>their</HI>
&s;piritual terrors, immediately, from his own authority,
confi&s;cated the e&s;tates of all the clergy who obeyed the
interdict<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Ann. Waverl. p. 170.</NOTE>; bani&s;hed the prelates, confined the monks
to their convent, and gave them only &s;uch a &s;mall al|lowance
from their own e&s;tates, as would &s;uffice to pro|vide
them in food and rayment. He treated with the
utmo&s;t rigour all Langton's adherents, and every one
that &s;howed any di&s;po&s;ition to obey the orders of Rome:
And that he might di&s;tre&s;s the clergy in the tendere&s;t
point, and at the &s;ame time expo&s;e them to reproach and
ridicule, he threw into pri&s;on all their concubines, and
required high fines and confi&s;cations as the price of their
liberty<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 158. Ann. Waverl. p. 170.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER the canons, which e&s;tabli&s;hed the celibacy of
the clergy, were, by the zealous endeavours of archbi|&s;hop
An&s;elm, more rigorou&s;ly executed in England, the
<PB N="66" REF="77">
eccle&s;ia&s;tics gave, almo&s;t univer&s;ally and avowedly, into
the u&s;e of concubinage; and the court of Rome, which
had no intere&s;t in prohibiting this practice, made a very
&s;light oppo&s;ition to it. The cu&s;tom was become &s;o pre|valent,
that in &s;ome cantons of Swi&s;&s;erland, before the
reformation, the laws not only permitted, but, to avoid
&s;candal, enjoined the u&s;e of concubines to the younger
clergy<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Padre Paolo, Hi&s;t. Conc. Trid. lib. I.</NOTE>; and it was u&s;ual every where for prie&s;ts to ap|ply
to their ordinary, and obtain from him a formal li|berty
for this indulgence. The bi&s;hop commonly took
care to prevent this practice from degenerating into li|centiou&s;ne&s;s:
He confined the prie&s;t to the u&s;e of one
woman, required him to be con&s;tant to her bed, obli|ged
him to provide for her &s;ub&s;i&s;tance and that of her
children; and, tho' the offspring was, in the eye of the
law, deemed illegitimate, this commerce was really a
kind of inferior marriage, &s;uch as is &s;till practi&s;ed in
Germany among the nobles; and may be regarded by
the candid as an appeal, from the tyranny of civil and
eccle&s;ia&s;tical institutions, to the more virtuous and more
unerring laws of nature.</P>
<P>THE quarrel between the King and the $ee of Rome
continued for &s;ome years; and tho' many of the clergy,
from the fear of puni&s;hment, obeyed the orders of Johns,
and celebrated divine &s;ervice, they complied with the ut|mo&s;t
reluctance, and were regarded, both by them&s;elves
and the people, as men who betrayed their principles,
and &s;acrificed their con&s;cience to temporal regards and in|tere&s;ts.
During this violent &s;ituation, the King, in or|der
to give a lu&s;tre to his government, attempted milita|ry
expeditions, again&s;t Scotland, again&s;t Ireland, again&s;t
the Wel&s;h<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">W. Homing, p. 556. Ypod Neu&s;t. p. 460. Knyghton, p. 2420.</NOTE>; and he commonly prevailed, more from
the weakne&s;s of his enemies than from his own vigour or
<PB N="67" REF="78">
abilities. Meanwhile, the danger to which his govern|ment
&s;tood continually expo&s;ed from the di&s;contents of
the eccle&s;ia&s;tics, increa&s;ed his natural propen&s;ion to ty|ranny;
and he &s;eems even wantonly to have di&s;gu&s;ted all
orders of men, e&s;pecially his nobles, from whom alone
he could rea&s;onably expect &s;upport and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He
di&s;honoured their families by his licentious amours; he
publi&s;hed edicts, prohibiting them from hunting feather|ed
game, and thereby re&s;trained them from their favou|rite
occupation and amu&s;ement<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">M. Westm. p. 268.</NOTE>; he ordered all the
hedges and fences near his fore&s;ts to be levelled, that his
deer might have more ready acce&s;s into the fields for pa&s;|ture;
and he continually loaded the nation with arbitra|ry
taxes and impo&s;itions.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1208.</NOTE> Con&s;cious of the general ha|tred
which he had incurred, he required his nobility to
give him ho&s;tages for &s;ecurity of their allegiance; and
they were obliged to put into his hands their &s;ons, or ne|phews,
or near relations. When his me&s;&s;engers came
with like orders to the ca&s;tle of William de Braou&s;e, a
baron of great note, the lady of that nobleman replied,
that &s;he would never entru&s;t her &s;on into the hands of
one who had murdered his own nephew, while in his
cu&s;tody. Her hu&s;band reproved her for the &s;everity of
this &s;peech; but, &s;en&s;ible of his danger, he immediately
fled with his wife and &s;on into Ireland, where he endea|voured
to conceal him&s;elf. The King di&s;covered the
unhappy family in their retreat; &s;eized the wife and &s;on,
whom he &s;tarved to death in pri&s;on; and the baron him|&s;elf
narrowly e&s;caped, by flying into France<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 158, 161. Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 52. Ann. Waverl. p. 172. Ann. Marg. p. 15. M. West. p 268, 269.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE church of Rome had artificially contrived a gra|dation
of &s;entences;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1209.</NOTE> by which the kept offenders in
<PB N="68" REF="79">
awe; &s;till afforded them an opportunity of preventing
the next anathema by &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and in ca&s;e of their
ob&s;tinacy, was able to refre&s;h the horror of the people
again&s;t them, by new denunciations of the wrath and
vengeance of heaven. As the &s;entence of interdict had
not operated the de&s;ired effect on John, and as his
people, tho' extremely di&s;contented, had hitherto been
re&s;trained from ri&s;ing into open rebellion again&s;t him, he
was &s;oon to look for the &s;entence of excommunication:
And he had rea&s;on to apprehend, that, notwith&s;tanding
all his precautions, the mo&s;t dangerous con&s;equences
might en&s;ue from it. He was witne&s;s of the other
&s;cenes, which, at that very time, were acting in Europe,
and which di&s;played the unbounded and uncontrouled
power of the papacy. Innocent, far from being di&s;may|ed
at his conte&s;ts with the King of England, had excom|municated
the Emperor Otho, John's nephew<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">M&punc; Paris&punc; p. 160. Trivet, p. 154. M. We&s;t. p. 269.</NOTE>; and
&s;oon brought that powerful and haughty prince to &s;ubmit
to his authority. He publi&s;hed a cru&s;ade again&s;t the Al|bigen&s;es,
a &s;pecies of enthu&s;ia&s;ts in the &s;outh of France,
whom he denominated heretics, becau&s;e, like other en|thu&s;ia&s;ts,
they neglected the rites of the church, and op|po&s;ed
the power and influence of the clergy: The people
from all parts of Europe, moved by their &s;uper&s;tition and
their pa&s;&s;ion for wars and adventures, flocked to his
&s;tandard: Simon de Montfort, the general of the cru|&s;ade,
acquired to him&s;elf a &s;overeignty in the&s;e provinces:
The count de Tholou&s;e, who protected the Albigen&s;es,
was de&s;poiled of his dominions: And the&s;e &s;ectaries
them&s;elves, tho' the mo&s;t innocent and inoffen&s;ive of
mankind, were exterminated with all the circum&s;tances
of the mo&s;t extreme violence and barbarity. Here was
therefore both an army and a general, dangerous from
their zeal and valour, ready to act again&s;t John; and
<PB N="69" REF="80">
Innocent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Excom|munication of the King.</NOTE> after keeping the thunder long &s;u&s;pended,
gave at la&s;t authority to the bi&s;hops of London, Ely,
and Worce&s;ter, to denounce the &s;entence of excommu|nication
again&s;t him<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 159. M. West. p. 270.</NOTE>. The&s;e prelates obeyed; tho'
their brethren were deterred from publi&s;hing, as the
Pope required of them, the &s;entence in the &s;everal
churches of their dioce&s;es.</P>
<P>NO &s;ooner was the excommunication known, than
the effects of it appeared. Geoffrey, archdeacon of
Norwich, who was entru&s;ted with a con&s;iderable office
in the court of exchequer, being informed of it while
&s;itting on the bench, ob&s;erved to his brethren the danger
of &s;erving under an excommunicated King; and he im|mediately
left his chair, and departed the court. John
gave orders to &s;eize him, to throw him into pri&s;on, to
cover his head with a great leaden cope; and by this and
other &s;evere u&s;age, he &s;oon put an end to his life<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 159.</NOTE>: Nor
was there any thing wanting to Geoffrey, except the dig|nity
and rank of Becket, to exalt him to an equal, &s;tation
in heaven with that great and celebrated martyr. Hugh
de Wells, the King's chancellor, being elected, by his
appointment, bi&s;hop of Lincoln, upon a vacancy in that
&s;ee, de&s;ired leave to go abroad, in order to receive conse|cration
from the archbi&s;hop of Ro&uuml;en; but he no &s;ooner
reached France, than he ha&s;tened to Pontigny, where Lang|ton
then re&s;ided, and paid &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to him as his primate.
The bi&s;hops, finding them&s;elves expo&s;ed equally to the
jealou&s;y of the King and hatred of the people, gradually
&s;tole out of the kingdom; and at la&s;t there remained only
three prelates to perform the functions of the epi&s;copal
office<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ann. Waverl. p. 170. Ann. Marg. p. 14.</NOTE>. Many of the nobility, terrified with John's ty|ranny,
and obnoxious to him on one account or other,
<PB N="70" REF="81">
imitated the example of the bi&s;hops; and mo&s;t of the
others, who remained, were with rea&s;on &s;u&s;pected of
having &s;ecretly entered into a confederacy again&s;t him<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 162. M. We&s;t. p. 270, 271.</NOTE>. John was alarmed at his dangerous &s;ituation; a &s;ituation,
which prudence, vigour, and popularity, might formerly
have prevented, but which no virtues nor abilities were
now &s;ufficient to remedy. He de&s;ired a conference with
Langton at Dover; offered to acknowledge him as pri|mate,
to &s;ubmit to the Pope, to re&s;tore the exiled clergy,
even to pay them a limited &s;um of money as a compen&s;a|tion
for the rents of their confi&s;cated e&s;tates. But
Langton, perceiving his advantage, was not &s;atisfied
with the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions: He demanded, that full re&s;titu|tion
and reparation &s;hould be made to all the clergy; a
condition &s;o exorbitant, that the King, who probably
had not the power of fulfilling it, and who fore&s;aw that
this e&s;timation of damages might amount to an infinite
&s;um, finally broke off the conference<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ann. Waverl. p. 171.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE next gradation of papal &s;entences was to ab&s;olve
John's &s;ubjects from their oaths of fidelity and allegiance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1212.</NOTE>
and to declare every one excommunicated who had any
commerce with him, in public or in private; at his table,
in his council, or even in private conversation<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 161. M. We&s;t. p. 270.</NOTE>: And
this &s;entence was accordingly, with all imaginable &s;o|lemnity,
denounced again&s;t him&punc; But as John &s;till per|&s;evered
in his contumacy, there remained nothing but
the &s;entence of depo&s;ition; which, tho' intimately con|nected
with the former, had been di&s;tingui&s;hed from it
by the artifice of the Romi&s;h church; and Innocent de|termined
to dart this la&s;t thunder-bolt again&s;t the refrac|tory
monarch. But as a &s;entence of this kind required an
armed force to execute it, the pontiff, ca&s;ting his eyes
<PB N="71" REF="82">
around, pitched at la&s;t on Philip, King of France, as
the per&s;on, into who&s;e powerful hand he could mo&s;t pro|perly
entru&s;t that weapon, the ultimate re&s;ource of his
gho&s;tly authority. And he proffered that monarch, be|&s;ides
the remi&s;&s;ion of all his &s;ins and endle&s;s &s;piritual be|nefits,
the property and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the kingdom of
England, as the reward of his labour<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 162. M. We&s;t. p. 271.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT was the common concern of all princes to oppo&s;e
the&s;e exorbitant preten&s;ions of the Roman pontiff,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1213.</NOTE> by
which they them&s;elves were rendered va&s;&s;als, and va&s;&s;als
totally dependant, of the papal crown: Yet even Philip,
the mo&s;t able monarch of the age, was &s;educed, by pre|&s;ent
intere&s;t, and by the pro&s;pect of &s;o tempting a prize,
to accept this liberal offer of the pontiff, and thereby to
ratify that authority, which, if he ever oppo&s;ed its
boundle&s;s u&s;urpations, might, next day, tumble him
from the throne. He levied a great army; &s;ummoned
all the va&s;&s;als of his crown to attend him at Ro&uuml;en;
collected a fleet of 1700 ve&s;&s;els, great and &s;mall, in the
&s;ea-ports of Normandy and Picardy; and partly from the
zeal of the age, partly from the per&s;onal regard, univer|&s;ally
paid him, prepared a force, which &s;eemed equal to
the greatne&s;s of his enterprize. The King, on the other
hand, i&s;&s;ued out writs, requiring the attendance of all
his military va&s;&s;als at Dover, and even of all able-bodied
men, to defend the kingdom in this dangerous extremity.
An infinite number appeared; of whom he &s;lected an
army of 60,000 men; a power invincible, had they been
united in affections to their prince, and animated with a
becoming zeal for the defence of their native country<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 163. M. We&s;t. p. 271.</NOTE>.
But the people were &s;wayed by &s;uper&s;tition, and regarded
their King with horror, as anathematized by papal cen|&s;ures:
<PB N="72" REF="83">
The barons, be&s;ides lying under the &s;ame preju|dices,
were all di&s;gu&s;ted with his tyranny, and were,
many of them, &s;u&s;pected of holding a &s;ecret corre&s;pon|dence
with the enemy: And the incapacity and cowardice
of the king him&s;elf, ill fitted to &s;truggle with tho&s;e
mighty difficulties, made men progno&s;ticate the mo&s;t fa|tal
effects from the French inva&s;ion.</P>
<P>PANDOLF,<NOTE PLACE="marg">13th May.</NOTE> whom the Pope had cho&s;en for his legate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's &s;ubmission to the Pope.</NOTE>
and appointed to head this important expedition, had,
before he left Rome, applied for a &s;ecret conference with
his ma&s;ter, and had a&s;ked him, whether if the King of
England, in this de&s;perate &s;ituation, were willing to &s;ub|mit
to the apo&s;tolic &s;ee, he &s;hould grant him, any terms
of accommodation<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 162.</NOTE>? Innocent, who expected more
advantages from his agreement with a prince &s;o abject
both in character and fortune, than from his alliance
with a great and victorious monarch, who, after &s;uch
mighty acqui&s;itions, might become too haughty to be
bound by &s;piritual chains, explained to Pandolf the con|ditions
on which he was willing to be reconciled to the
King of England. The legate, therefore, as &s;oon as he
arrived in the north of France, &s;ent over two knights
templars to de&s;ire an interview with John at Dover,
which was readily granted; and he there represented to
him, in &s;uch &s;trong, and probably in &s;uch true colours,

<P>BUT the ignominy of the King was not yet carried to
its full height. Pandolf, as the fir&s;t &s;pecimen of his de|ference
to the Pope's orders, required him to re&s;ign his
kingdom to the church, and he per&s;uaded him, that he
could no way &s;o effectually di&s;appoint the French inva|&s;ion,
as by thus, putting him&s;elf under the immediate
protection of the apo&s;tolic &s;ee. John, lying under the
agonies of pre&s;ent terror, made no &s;cruple of &s;ubmitting
to this condition. He pa&s;&s;ed a charter, in which he &s;aid,
that, not con&s;trained by fear, but of his own free-will,
and by the common advice and con&s;ent of his barons, he
had, for the remi&s;&s;ion of his own &s;ins and tho&s;e of his fa|mily,
re&s;igned England and Ireland to God, to St. Peter
and St. Paul, and to Pope Innocent and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in
the apo&s;tolic chair: He agreed to hold the&s;e dominions
as feudatory of the church of Rome, by the annual pay|ment
of a thou&s;and marks; &s;even hundred for England,
three hundred for Ireland: And he &s;tipulated, that if he
or his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors &s;hould ever pre&s;ume to revoke or infringe
this charter, they &s;hould in&s;tantly, except upon admoni|tion

<P>IN con&s;equence of this agreement,<NOTE PLACE="marg">15th May.</NOTE> John did homage
to Pandolf as the Pope's legate, with all the humiliating
<PB N="74" REF="85">
rites which the feudal law required of va&s;&s;als before their
liege-lord and &s;uperior. He came di&s;armed into the le|gate's
pre&s;ence, who was &s;eated on a throne; he flung
him&s;elf on his knees before him; he lifted up his joined
hands, and put them within tho&s;e of Pandolf; he &s;wore
fealty to the Pope; and he paid part of the tribute, which
he owed for his kingdom as the patrimony of St. Peter.
The legate, elated by this &s;upreme triumph of &s;acerdotal
power, could not forbear di&s;covering extravagant &s;ymp|toms
of joy and exultation: He trampled on the money,
which was laid at his feet as an earne&s;t of the &s;ubjection
of the kingdom: An in&s;olence, which, however offen|&s;ive
to all the Engli&s;h, no one pre&s;ent, except the arch|bi&s;hop
of Dublin, dared to take any notice of. But
tho' Pandolf had brought the King to &s;ubmit to the&s;e
ba&s;e conditions, he &s;till refu&s;ed to take off the excommu|nication
and interdict, till an e&s;timation &s;hould be taken
of the lo&s;&s;es of the eccle&s;ia&s;tics, and full compen&s;ation
and re&s;titution &s;hould be made them.</P>
<P>JOHN, reduced to this abject &s;ituation under a foreign
power, &s;till &s;howed the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition to tyranny over
his &s;ubjects, which had been the chief cau&s;e of all his
misfortunes. One Peter of Pomfret, a hermit, had fore|told,
that the King, this very year, &s;hould lo&s;e his
crown; and for that ra&s;h prophecy, he had been thrown
into pri&s;on in Corfe-ca&s;tle. John now determined to
bring him to puni&s;hment as an impo&s;tor; and tho' the
man pleaded, that his prophecy was fulfilled, and that
the King had lo&s;t the royal and independant crown which
he formerly wore, the defence was &s;uppo&s;ed to augment
his guilt: He was dragged at hor&s;es tails to the town of
Warham, and there hanged on a gibbet with his &s;on<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 165. Chron. Dun&s;t. vol. i. p. 56. Chron. Mailr. p 186, 187. T. Wykes, p. 37. Ann. Waverl. p. 179. M. We&s;t. p. 270, 272, Knyghton, p. 2324.</NOTE>.</P>

WHEN Pandolf, after receiving the homage of John,
returned to the court of France, he congratulated Philip
on the &s;ucce&s;s of his pious enterprize; and informed him
that John, moved by the terror of the French arms, had
now come to a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of his guilt; had returned to
obedience under the apo&s;tolic &s;ee; had even con&s;ented
to do homage to the Pope for his dominions; and having
thus made his kingdom a part of St. Peter's patrimony,
had rendered it impo&s;&s;ible for any Chri&s;tian prince, with|out
the mo&s;t manife&s;t and mo&s;t flagrant impiety, to at|tack
him<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">$word$, p. 160.</NOTE>. Philip was in a rage on receiving this intel|ligence:
He exclaimed, that having, at the Pope's in|&s;tigation,
undertaken an expedition, which had co&s;t him
above 60,000 pounds &s;terling, he was fru&s;trated of his
purpo&s;e, at the time when its &s;ucce&s;s was become infalli|ble:
He complained, that all the expence had fallen up|on
him; all the advantage had accrued to. Innocent: He
threatened to be no longer the dupe of the&s;e hypocriti|cal
pretences: And a&s;&s;embling his va&s;&s;als, he laid before
them the ill treatment which he had received, expo&s;ed
the intere&s;ted and fraudulent conduct of the Pope, and re|quired
their a&s;&s;i&s;tance to execute his enterprize again&s;t
England, in which, he told them, that, notwith&s;tand|ing
the inhibitions and menaces of the legate, he was
determined to per&s;evere. The French barons were in
that age little le&s;s ignorant and &s;uper&s;titious than the
Engli&s;h: Yet, &s;o much does the influence of the&s;e reli|gious
principles depend on the pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition of mens
minds! they all vowed to follow their prince on his in|tended
expedition, and were re&s;olute not to be di&s;ap|pointed
of that glory and tho&s;e riches, which they had
long expected from this enterprize. The earl of Flan|ders
alone, who had previou&s;ly formed a &s;ecret treaty
with John, declaring again&s;t the inju&s;tice and impiety of
the undertaking, withdrew with his forces<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 166.</NOTE>; and Phi|lip,
<PB N="76" REF="87">
that he might not leave &s;o dangerous an enemy be|hind
him, fir&s;t turned his arms again&s;t the dominions of
that prince. Meanwhile, the Engli&s;h fleet was a&s;&s;em|bled
under the earl of Sali&s;bury, the King's natural bro|ther;
and tho' inferior in number, received orders to at|tack
the French in their harbours. Sali&s;bury performed
this &s;ervice with &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s, that he
took three hundred &s;hips; de&s;troyed a hundred more<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 166. Chron. dun&s;t, vol. i. p. 59. Trivet, p. 157.</NOTE>: And Philip,
finding it impo&s;&s;ible to prevent the re&s;t from falling into
the hands of the enemy, &s;et fire to them him&s;elf, and
thereby rendered it impo&s;&s;ible for him to proceed any
farther in his enterprize.</P>
<P>JOHN, exulting in his pre&s;ent &s;ecurity, in&s;en&s;ible to
his pa&s;t di&s;grace, was &s;o elated with this &s;ucce&s;s, that he
thought of no le&s;s than of invading France in his turn,
and of recovering all tho&s;e provinces which the pro&s;perous
arms of Philip had formerly ravi&s;hed from him. He pro|po&s;ed
this expedition to the barons, who were already a&s;|&s;embled
for the defence of the kingdom. But the Eng|li&s;h
barons both hated and de&s;pi&s;ed their prince: They
progno&s;ticated no &s;ucce&s;s to any enterprize conducted by
&s;uch a leader: And pretending, that their time of &s;ervice
was elap&s;ed, and all their provi&s;ions exhau&s;ted, they re|fu&s;ed
to &s;econd his undertaking<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 166.</NOTE>. The King, however,
re&s;olute in his purpo&s;e, embarked with a few followers,
and failed to Jer&s;ey, in the fooli&s;h notion, that the barons
would at la&s;t be a&s;hamed to &s;tay behind<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. But finding
him&s;elf di&s;appointed, he returned to England; and rai&s;|ing
&s;ome troops, threatened to take vengeance on all his
nobles for their de&s;ertion and di&s;obedience. The arch|bi&s;hop
of Canterbury, who was in a confederacy with
the nobles, here interpo&s;ed; &s;trictly inhibited the King
from thinking of &s;uch an attempt; and threatened him
<PB N="77" REF="88">
with a renewal of the &s;entence of excommunication, it
he pretended to levy war upon any of his &s;ubjects, before
the kingdom was freed from the &s;entence of interdict<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 167.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE church had di&s;&s;olved the &s;everal anathemas pro|nounced
again&s;t John, by the &s;ame gradual progre&s;s with
which &s;he had at fir&s;t i&s;&s;ued them. By receiving his ho|mage,
and admitting him to the rank of va&s;&s;al, his de|po&s;ition
was annulled, and his &s;ubjects were again bound
by their oaths of allegiance. The exiled prelates then
returned in great triumph, with Langton at their head;
and the King, hearing of their approach, went forth to
meet them, and throwing him&s;elf on the ground before
them, he entreated them with tears to have compa&s;&s;ion
on him and the kingdom of England<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 166. Ann. Waverl. p 178.</NOTE>. The primate,
&s;eeing the&s;e marks of &s;incere penitence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">20th July.</NOTE> led him to the
chapter-hou&s;e of Winche&s;ter, and there admini&s;tered an
oath to him, by which he again &s;wore fealty and obedi|ence
to Pope Innocent and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors; promi&s;ed to
love, maintain, and defend holy church and the clergy;
engaged, that he would re-e&s;tabli&s;h the good laws of his
ance&s;torS, particularly tho&s;e of St. Edward, and would
aboli&s;h the wicked ones; and expre&s;&s;ed his re&s;olution of
maintaining ju&s;tice and right in all his dominions<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 166.</NOTE>. The
primate next gave him ab&s;olution in the requi&s;ite forms,
and admitted him to dine with him, to the great joy of all
the people. The &s;entence, however, of interdict was &s;till
upheld again&s;t the kingdom. A new legate, Nicholas, bi|&s;hop
of Fre&s;cati, came into England, in the place of Pan|dolf;
and he declared it to be the Pope's intentions never
to loo&s;en that &s;entence, till full re&s;titution was made to the
clergy of every thing taken from them, and ample repa|ration
for all damages which they had &s;u&s;tained<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. 160. Ann. Waverl. p. 178.</NOTE>.
He only permitted ma&s;s to be &s;aid with a low voice in the
<PB N="78" REF="89">
churches, till the&s;e lo&s;&s;es and damages could be e&s;timated
to the &s;atisfaction of the parties. Certain barons were
appointed to take an account of the claims<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Brady's Append. N&deg; 103, 104.</NOTE>; and John
was a&s;toni&s;hed at the greatne&s;s of the &s;ums, to which the
clergy made their lo&s;&s;es to amount. No le&s;s than twenty
thou&s;and marks were demanded by the monks of Can|terbury
alone; twenty-three thou&s;and for the &s;ee of Lin|coln<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Chron. Dun&s;t. vol. 1. p. 64.</NOTE>;
and the King, finding the&s;e preten&s;ions to be in|finite
and endle&s;s, proffered the clergy the &s;um of an
hundred thou&s;and marks for a final acquittal. The cler|gy
rejected the offer with di&s;dain; but the Pope, willing
to favour his new va&s;&s;al, whom he found zealous in his
declarations of fealty, and regular in paying the &s;ti|pulated
tribute to Rome, directed his legate to accept of
forty thou&s;and<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 173. Chron. Dun&s;t. vol. i. p. 62.</NOTE>. The i&s;&s;ue-of the whole was, that the
bi&s;hops and con&s;iderable abbots got reparation beyond
what they had any title to demand: The inferior clergy
were obliged to the &s;it down contented with their lo&s;&s;es<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ann. Waverl. p. 179.</NOTE>:
And the King, after the &s;entence of interdict was taken
off, renewed, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, and by a new
charter, &s;ealed with gold, his profe&s;&s;ions of homage and
obedience to the &s;ee of Rome<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 172.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN this vexatious affair was at la&s;t brought to a
conclu&s;ion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1214</NOTE> the King, as if he had nothing farther to at|tend
to but triumphs and victories, went over to Poictou,
which &s;till acknowledged his authority<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Queen Eleanor died in 1203 or 1204.</NOTE>; and he carried
war into Philip's dominions. He be&s;ieged a ca&s;tle near
Angiers; but the approach of prince Lewis, Philip's
&s;on, obliged him to rai&s;e the &s;iege with &s;uch precipita|tion,
that he left his tents, machines, and baggage be|hind
him; and he returned to England with di&s;grace.
<PB N="79" REF="90">
About the &s;ame time, he heard of the great and deci&s;ive
victory gained by the King of France at Bovines over
the Emperor Otho, who had entered France at the head
of 150,000 Germans; a victory which e&s;tabli&s;hed for ever
the glory of Philip, and gave full &s;ecurity to all his do|minions.
John could therefore think henceforth of no|thing
farther, than of ruling peaceably his own kingdom;
and his clo&s;e conjunction with the Pope, which he was
determined at any price to maintain, en&s;ured him, as he
imagined, the certain attainment of this object. But the
la&s;t and mo&s;t grievous &s;cene of this prince's misfortunes
&s;till awaited him; and he was de&s;tined to pa&s;s thro'a &s;eries
of more humiliating circum&s;tances than had ever yet fal|len
to the lot of any other monarch.</P>
<P>THE introduction of the feudal law into England by
William the Conqueror had much infringed the liberties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;contents of the ba|rons.</NOTE>
however imperfect, enjoyed by the Anglo-Saxons in their
antient government, and had reduced the whole people
to a &s;tate of va&s;&s;alage under the King or barons, and
even the greate&s;t part of them to a real &s;tate of &s;lavery.
The nece&s;&s;ity al&s;o of devolving great power into the
hands of a prince, who was to maintain a military do|minion
over a vanqui&s;hed nation, had engaged the Nor|man
barons to &s;ubmit to a more rigorous&punc; and ab&s;olute
authority, than that to which men of their rank, in other
feudal governments, were commonly &s;ubjected. The
prerogatives of the crown, once rai&s;ed to a high pitch,
were not ea&s;ily reduced; and the nation, during the
cour&s;e of a hundred and fifty years, had groaned under
a tyranny, unknown to all the kingdoms founded by
the northern conquerors. Henry I. that he might allure
the people to give an exclu&s;ion to his elder brother Ro|bert,
had granted them a charter, favourable in many
particulars to their liberties; Stephen had renewed this
grant; Henry II. had confirmed it: But the conce&s;&s;ions
<PB N="80" REF="91">
of all the&s;e princes had &s;till remained without effect; and
the &s;ame unlimited, at lea&s;t irregular authority, conti|nued
to be exerci&s;ed both by them and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors.
The only happine&s;s was, that arms were never yet ra|vi&s;hed
from the hands of the barons and people: The
nation, by a great confederacy, might &s;till vindicate its
liberties: And nothing was more likely, than the cha|racter,
conduct, and fortunes of the pre&s;ent &s;overeign,
to produce &s;uch a general union and combination again&s;t
him. Equally odious and contemptible, both in public
and private life, he affronted the barons by his in&s;olence,
di&s;honoured their families by his gallantries, enraged
them by his tyranny, and gave di&s;content to all ranks
of men by his endle&s;s exactions and impo&s;itions<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Chron. Mailr. p. 188. T. Wykes, p. 36. Ann. Waverl. p. 181. W Heming. p. 557.</NOTE>. The
effect of the&s;e lawle&s;s practices had already appeared in
the general demand made by the barons of a re&s;toration
of their privileges; and after he had reconciled him&s;elf
to the Pope, by abandoning the independance of the king|dom,
he appeared to all the world in &s;o mean a light,
that they univer&s;ally thought they might with &s;afety and
honour in&s;i&s;t upon their preten&s;ions.</P>
<P>BUT nothing forwarded this confederacy &s;o much as
the concurrence of Langton, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury;
a man, whole memory, tho' he was obtruded on the na|tion
by a palpable incroachment of. the fee of Rome,
ought always to be re&s;pected by the Engli&s;h. This pre|late,
whether he was moved by the genero&s;ity of his nature
and his affection to public good; or had entertained an
animo&s;ity again&s;t John, on account of the long oppo&s;ition
made by that prince to his election; or thought, that
an acqui&s;ition of liberty to the people would &s;erve to in|crea&s;e
and &s;ecure the privileges of the church; had formed
the plan of reforming the government, and had prepared
the way for that great innovation, by in&s;erting tho&s;e
<PB N="81" REF="92">
&s;ingular clau&s;es above-mentioned in the oath, which he ad|mini&s;tered
to the King, before he would ab&s;olve him from
the &s;entence of excommunication. Soon after, in a private
meeting of &s;ome principal barons at London, he &s;howed
them a copy of Henry I.'s charter, which, he &s;aid, he had
happily found in a mona&s;tery; and he exhorted them to
in&s;ist on the renewal and ob&s;ervance of it: The barons
&s;wore, that they would &s;ooner lo&s;e their lives than depart
from &s;o rea&s;onable a demand<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 167.</NOTE>. The confederacy began
now to &s;pread wider, and to comprehend almo&s;t all the
barons of England; and a new and more numerous meet|ing
was &s;ummoned by Langton at St. Edmond&s;bury,<NOTE PLACE="marg">November.</NOTE> un|der
colour of devotion. He again produced to the a&s;&s;em|bly
the old charter of Henry; renewed his exhortations
of unanimity and vigour in the pro&s;ecution of their purpo&s;e;
and repre&s;ented in the &s;tronge&s;t colours the tyran|ny
to which they had &s;o long been &s;ubjected, and from
which it now behoved them to free them&s;elves and their
posterity<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 175.</NOTE>. The barons, inflamed by his eloquence, in|cited
by the &s;en&s;e of their wrongs, and encouraged by
the appearance of their power and numbers, &s;olemnly
took an oath before the high altar, to adhere to each
other, to insist on their demands, and to make endless
war on the King, till he &s;hould &s;ubmit to grant them<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 176.</NOTE>.
They agreed, that, after the fe&s;tival of Chri&s;tmas, they
would prefer in a body their common petition; and in
the mean time, they &s;eparated, after mutually promi&s;ing,
that they would put them&s;elves in a po&s;ture of defence,
would inlist men and purcha&s;e arms, and would &s;upply
their ca&s;tles with the nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>THE barons appeared in London on the day appointed;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1215.</NOTE>
and demanded of the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th Janu|ary.</NOTE> that, in con&s;equence of his
own oath before the primate, as well as in deference to
<PB N="82" REF="93">
their ju&s;t rights, he would grant them a renewal of Henry's
charter, and a confirmation of the laws of St. Edward.
The King, alarmed with their zeal and unanimity, as
well as with their power, required a delay; promi&s;ed,
that at the fe&s;tival of Ea&s;ter, he would give them a po&s;i|tive
an&s;wer to their petition; and offered them the arch|bi&s;hop
of Canterbury, the bi&s;hop of Ely, and the earl
of Pembroke, the Mare&s;chal, as &s;ureties for his fulfilling
this engagement<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 176. M. We&s;t. p. 273.</NOTE>. The barons accepted of the terms,
and peaceably returned to their ca&s;tles.</P>
<P>DURING this interval,<NOTE PLACE="marg">15th Janu|ary.</NOTE> John, in order to break or

him&s;elf of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical power, of who&s;e influence
he had, from his own recent misfortunes, had &s;uch fatal
experience. He granted to the clergy a charter, aban|doning
for ever that important prerogative, for which
his father and all his ance&s;tors had zealou&s;ly contended;
yielding to them the free election on all vacancies; re|&s;erving
only the power to i&s;&s;ue a cong&eacute; d'elire, and to

re&s;tore and confirm all their ju&s;t and undoubted privi|leges<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>INNOCENT beheld with regret the di&s;turbances which
had ari&s;en in England, and was much inclined to favour
John in his preten&s;ions. He had no other hopes of re|taining
and extending his newly acquired &s;uperiority
over that kingdom, but by &s;upporting &s;o ba&s;e and dege|nerate
a prince, who was willing to &s;acrifice every con&s;i|deration
to his pre&s;ent &s;afety; and he fore&s;aw, that, if
the admini&s;tration fell into the hands of the&s;e gallant and
high-&s;pirited barons, they would vindicate the honour,
liberty, and independance of the nation, with the fame
ardour which they now exerted in defence of their own.
He wrote letters therefore to the prelates, to the nobility,
and to the King him&s;elf. He exhorted the fir&s;t to em|ploy
their good offices in conciliating peace between the
contending parties, and putting an end to civil di&s;cord:
To the &s;econd, he expre&s;&s;ed his di&s;approbation of their
conduct in employing force to extort conce&s;&s;ions from
their reluctant &s;overeign: The la&s;t, he advi&s;ed to treat
his nobles with grace and indulgence, and to grant them
&s;uch of their demands as &s;hould appear ju&s;t and rea&s;on|able

<P>THE barons ea&s;ily &s;aw, from the tenor of the&s;e letters,
that they mu&s;t lay their account with having the
Pope, as well as the King, for their adver&s;ary; but they
had already advanced too far to recede from their preten|&s;ions,
and their pa&s;&s;ions were &s;o deeply engaged, that it
exceeded even the power of &s;uper&s;tition it&s;elf any longer
to controul them. They al&s;o fore&s;aw, that the thunders
of Rome, when not &s;econded by the efforts of the Eng|lish
<PB N="84" REF="95">
eccle&s;ia&s;tics, would be of &s;mall avail again&s;t them;
and they perceived, that the most con&s;iderable of the
prelates, as well as all the inferior clergy, profe&s;&s;ed the
highe&s;t approbation of their cau&s;e. Be&s;ides, that the&s;e
men were &s;eized with the national pa&s;&s;ion for laws and
liberty; ble&s;&s;ings, of which they them&s;elves expected to
partake; there concurred very powerful cau&s;es to loo&s;en
their devoted attachment to the apo&s;tolic &s;ee. It ap|peared
from all the late u&s;urpations of the Roman pon|tiff,
that he pretended to reap alone all the advantages
accruing from that victory, which, under his banners,
tho' at their own hazard, they had every where obtained
over the civil magi&s;trate. The Pope a&s;&s;umed a de&s;potic
power over all the churches: Their particular cu&s;toms,
privileges, and immunities, were treated with di&s;dain:
Even, the canons of general councils were &s;et a&s;ide by his
di&s;pen&s;ing power: The whole admini&s;tration of the
church was centered in the court of Rome: All preferments
ran of cour&s;e in the &s;ame channel: And the pro|vincial
clergy &s;aw, at lea&s;t felt, that there was a nece&s;|&s;ity
of limiting the&s;e exorbitant preten&s;ions. The legate,
Nicholas, in filling tho&s;e numerous vacancies which had
fallen in England during an interdict of &s;ix years, had
proceeded in the mo&s;t arbitrary manner; and had paid no
regard, in conferring dignities, to per&s;onal merit, to
rank, to the inclination of the electors, or to the cu&s;toms
of the country. The English church was univer&s;ally
di&s;gu&s;ted; and Langton himself, tho' he owed his eleva|tion
to an encroachment of the Romi&s;h &s;ee, was no
&s;ooner e&s;tabli&s;hed in his high office, than he became
jealous of the privileges annexed to it, and formed at|tachments
with the country &s;ubjected to his juri&s;diction.
The&s;e cau&s;es, tho' they opened &s;lowly the eyes of men,
&s;ailed not to produce their effect: They &s;et bounds to
the u&s;urpations of the papacy: The tide fir&s;t &s;topped, and
<PB N="85" REF="96">
then turned again&s;t the &s;overeign pontiff: And it is
otherwi&s;e inconceivable, how that age, &s;o prone to &s;u|per&s;tition,
and &s;o &s;unk in ignorance, or rather &s;o de|voted
to a &s;purious erudition, could have e&s;caped falling
into an ab&s;olute and total &s;lavery under the court of
Rome.</P>
<P>ABOUT the time that the Pope's letters arrived in Eng|land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In&s;urrecti|on of the barons.</NOTE>
the malcontent barons, on the approach of the
fe&s;tival of Ea&s;ter, when they were to expect the King's
an&s;wer to their petitions, met by agreement at Stamford;
and they a&s;&s;embled a force, con&s;i&s;ting of above 2000
knights, be&s;ides their retainers and inferior per&s;ons with|out
number. Elated with their power, they advanced in
a body to Brackley,<NOTE PLACE="marg">27th April.</NOTE> within fifteen miles of Oxford, the
place where the court then re&s;ided; and they there re|ceived
a me&s;&s;age from the King, by the archbi&s;hop of
Canterbury and the earl of Pembroke, de&s;iring to know
what tho&s;e liberties were which they &s;o zealou&s;ly chal|lenged
from their &s;overeign. They delivered to the&s;e
me&s;&s;engers a &s;chedule, containing the chief articles of
their demands; which was no &s;ooner &s;hown to the King,
than he bur&s;t into a furious pa&s;&s;ion, and a&s;ked, why the
barons did not al&s;o demand of him his kingdom? &s;wear|ing,
that he would never grant them &s;uch liberties as
mu&s;t reduce him&s;elf to &s;lavery<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 176. 71.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NO &s;ooner were the confederated nobles informed of
John's refu&s;al, than they choo&s;e Robert Fitz-Walter for
general, whom they called <HI>the Mare&s;chal of the army of
God and of holy church;</HI> and they proceeded without far|ther
ceremony to make war upon the King. They be|sieged
the ca&s;tle of Northampton during fifteen days,
tho' without &s;ucce&s;s<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 177. Chron. Dun&s;t. vol. i. p. 71.</NOTE>: The gates of Bedford ca&s;tle were

willingly opened to them by William Beauchamp, its

where they held a corre&s;pondence with the princi|pal
citizens: They were received without oppo&s;ition into
that capital: And finding now the great &s;uperiority of
their force, they i&s;&s;ued out proclamations, requiring the
other barons to join them, and menacing them, in ca&s;e
&s;f refu&s;al or delay, with committing deva&s;tation on their
hou&s;es and e&s;tates<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 177.</NOTE>. In order to &s;how them what they
might expect from their pro&s;perous arms, they made in|cur&s;ions
from London, and laid wa&s;te the King's parks
and palaces; and all the barons, who had hitherto carried
the &s;emblance of &s;upporting the royal party, were
glad of this pretence to join openly a cau&s;e, which they
always had &s;ecretly favoured. The King was left at
Odiham in Surrey with a poor retinue of only &s;even
knights; and after trying &s;everal expedients to elude the
blow, after offering to refer all differences to the Pope
alone, or to eight barons, four to be cho&s;en by himfelf,
and four by the confederates<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 200.</NOTE>, he found him&s;elf at la&s;t
obliged to &s;ubmit at di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>A CONFERENCE between,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Magna Charta. 15th June.</NOTE> the King and the barons
was appointed at Runnemede,<NOTE PLACE="marg">19th June&punc;</NOTE> between Wind&s;or and
Staines; a place which has ever &s;ince been extremely
celebrated, on account of this great event. The two
parties encamped apart, like open enemies; and after a
debate of a few days, the King, with a facility which
was &s;omewhat &s;u&s;picious, &s;igned and &s;ealed the charter
which was required of him. This famous deed, com|monly
called the GREAT CHARTER, either granted or
&s;ecured very important liberties and privileges to every
order of men in the kingdom, to the clergy, to the ba|rons,
and to the people.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="98">
THE freedom of elections was &s;ecured to the clergy:
The former charter of the King was confirmed, by
which the nece&s;&s;ity of a royal cong&eacute; d'elire and confir|mation
was &s;uper&s;eded: All check upon appeals to Rome
was removed, by the allowance granted every man to
depart the kingdom at plea&s;ure: And the fines upon the
clergy, for any offence, were ordained to be proportio|nal
to their lay e&s;tates, not to their eccle&s;ia&s;tical be|nefices.</P>
<P>THE privileges granted to the barons were either a|batements
in the rigors of the feudal law, or determina|tions
in points which had been left by that law, or had
become by practice, arbitrary and ambiguous. The re|liefs
of heirs &s;ucceeding to a military fee were a&s;certained;
an earl's and baron's at an hundred marks, a knight's at
an hundred &s;hillings. It was ordained by the charter,
that, if the heir be a minor, he &s;hall, immediately up|on
his majority, enter upon his e&s;tate, without paying
any relief: The King &s;hall not &s;ell his ward&s;hip: He
&s;hall levy only rea&s;onable profits upon the e&s;tate, with|out
committing wa&s;te or hurting the property: He &s;hall
uphold the ca&s;tles, hou&s;es, mills, parks and ponds: And
if he commit the guardian&s;hip of the e&s;tate to the &s;he|riff
or any other, he &s;hall previou&s;ly oblige them to find
&s;urety to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. During the minority of a
baron, while his lands are in ward&s;hip, and are not in
his own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, no debt which he owes to the Jews
&s;hall bear any intere&s;t. Heirs &s;hall be married with|out
di&s;paragement; and before the marriage be con|tracted,
the neare&s;t relations of the per&s;ons &s;hall be in|formed
of it. A widow, without paying any relief,
&s;hall enter upon her dower, the third part of her hu&s;|band's
rents: She &s;hall not be compelled to marry, &s;o
long as &s;he chu&s;es to continue &s;ingle; &s;he &s;hall only
give &s;ecurity never to marry without her lord's con&s;ent.

The King &s;hall not claim the ward&s;hip of any minor
who holds lands by military tenure of a baron,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XI.</NOTE> on pre|tence
that he al&s;o holds lands of the crown,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1215.</NOTE> by &s;occage
or any other tenure. Scutages &s;hall be e&s;timated at the
&s;ame rate as in the time of Henry I.; and no &s;cutage or
aid, except in the three general feudal ca&s;es, the King's
captivity, the knighting his elde&s;t &s;on, and the marrying
his elde&s;t daughter, &s;hall be impo&s;ed but by the great
council of the kingdom; the prelates, earls and great
barons, &s;hall be called to this great council, each by a
particular writ; the le&s;&s;er barons by a general &s;ummons
of the &s;heriff. The King &s;hall not &s;eize any baron's
land for a debt to the crown, if the baron po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es as
many goods and chattels as are &s;ufficient to di&s;charge
that debt. No man &s;hall be obliged to perform, more
&s;ervice, for his fee than he is bound to by his tenure.
No governor or con&s;table of a ca&s;tle &s;hall oblige any
knight to give money for ca&s;tle-guard, if he is willing
to perform the &s;ervice in per&s;on, or by another able|bodied
man; and if the knight be in the field him&s;elf, by
the King's command, he &s;hall be exempt from all other
&s;ervice of this nature. No va&s;&s;al &s;hall be allowed to &s;ell
&s;o much of his land as to incapacitate him&s;elf from per|forming
his &s;ervice to his lord.</P>
<P>THESE were the principal articles, which were cal|culated
for the intere&s;ts of the barons; and had the
charter contained nothing farther, national happine&s;s
and liberty had been very little promoted by it, as it
would only have tended to increa&s;e the power and in|dependance
of an order of men, who were already too
powerful, and who&s;e yoke might have become more
heavy on the people than even that of an ab&s;olute
monarch. But the barons, who alone drew and im|po&s;ed
on the prince this memorable charter, were ne|ce&s;&s;itated
to in&s;ert in it other clau&s;es of a more ex|ten&s;ive
<PB N="89" REF="102">
and more beneficent nature: They could not
expect the concurrence of the people, without com|prehending,
together with their own, the intere&s;ts of inferior ranks of
men; and all provi&s;ions, which the
barons, for their own &s;akes, were obliged to make, in
order to en&s;ure the free and equitable admini&s;tration of
ju&s;tice, tended directly to the benefit of the whole
community. The following were the principal clau&s;es
of this nature.</P>
<P>IT was ordained, that all the privileges and immu|nities
above mentioned, granted to the barons again&s;t
the King, &s;hould be extended by the barons to their
inferior va&s;&s;als. The king bound him&s;elf not to grant
any writ, empowering a baron to levy aids from his
va&s;&s;als, except in the three feudal ca&s;es. One weight
and one mea&s;ure &s;hall be ob&s;erved throughout the whole
kingdom. Merchants &s;hall be allowed to tran&s;act all
bu&s;ine&s;s, without being expo&s;ed to any arbitrary tolls
and impo&s;itions: They and all free men &s;hall be al|lowed
to go out of the kingdom and return to it at
plea&s;ure. London, and all cities and burghs, &s;hall pre|&s;erve
their antient: liberties, immunities and free cu&s;|toms:
Aids &s;hall not be required of them but by the
con&s;ent of the great council. No towns nor indivi|duals
&s;hall be obliged to make or &s;upport bridges but
by antient cu&s;tom. The goods of every free man
&s;hall be di&s;po&s;ed of according to his will: If he die
inte&s;tate, his heirs &s;hall &s;ucceed to them. No officer
of the crown &s;hall take any hor&s;es, carts, or wood,
without the con&s;ent of the owner. The King's courts
of ju&s;tice &s;hall be &s;tationary, and &s;hall no longer fol|low
his per&s;on: They &s;hall be open to every one;
and ju&s;tice &s;hall no longer be bought, refu&s;ed, or de|layed
by them. The &s;heriffs &s;hall be incapacitated to
hold pleas of the crown; and &s;hall not put any per&s;on
<PB N="90" REF="103">
upon his trial, from rumour or &s;u&s;picion alone, but upon
the evidence of lawful witne&s;&s;es. No freeman &s;hall be
taken or impri&s;oned, or di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his free tenement
and liberties, or outlawed, or bani&s;hed, or any wi&s;e hurt
or injured, unle&s;s by the legal judgment of his peers, or
by the law of the land; and all who &s;uffered otherwi&s;e in
this or the two former reigns, &s;hall be re&s;tored to their
rights and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. Every freeman &s;hall be fined in
proportion to his fault; and no fine &s;hall be levied on
him to his utter ruin: Even a villain or ru&s;tic &s;hall not
by any fine be bereaved of his carts, ploughs, and im|plements
of hu&s;bandry. This was the only article cal|culated
for the intere&s;ts of this body of men, probably at
that time the mo&s;t numerous in the kingdom.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the former articles of the
Great Charter contain &s;uch mitigations and explanations
of the feudal law as are very rea&s;onable and equitable;
and that the latter involve all the chief outlines of a le|gal
government, and provide for the equal di&s;tribution
of ju&s;tice, and free enjoyment of property; the great ob|jects
for which political &s;ociety was at fir&s;t founded by
men, which the people have a perpetual and unalienable
right to recall, and which no time, nor precedent, nor
&s;tatute, nor po&s;itive in&s;titution, ought to deter them
from keeping ever uppermo&s;t in their thoughts and atten|tion.
Tho' the provi&s;ions made by this charter might,
conformable to the genius of the age, be e&s;teemed too
conci&s;e, and too bare of circum&s;tances, to maintain the
execution of its articles, in oppo&s;ition to the chicanery
of lawyers, &s;upported by the violence of power; time
gradually a&s;certained the &s;en&s;e of all the ambiguous ex|pre&s;&s;ions;
and tho&s;e generous barons, who fir&s;t extorted
this conce&s;&s;ion, &s;till held their &s;words in their hands
and could turn them again&s;t tho&s;e who dared, on an
pretence, to depart from the original &s;pirit and meanin
<PB N="91" REF="104">
of the grant. It is now ea&s;y, from the tenor of this
charter, to determine what tho&s;e laws were of King Ed|ward,
which the Engli&s;h nation, during &s;o many genera|tions,
&s;till de&s;ired, with &s;uch an ob&s;tinate per&s;everance,
to have recalled and e&s;tabli&s;hed. They were the&s;e latter
articles of <HI>Magna Charta;</HI> and the barons, who, at the
beginning of the&s;e commotions, required the revival of
the Saxon laws, undoubtedly thought, that they had
&s;ufficiently &s;atisfied the people by procuring them this
conce&s;&s;ion, which comprehended the chief objects to
which they had &s;o long a&s;pired. But what we are mo&s;t
to admire, is the prudence and moderation of the&s;e
haughty nobles them&s;elves, who were enraged by injuries,
inflamed by oppo&s;ition, and elated by a total victory over
their &s;overeign. They were contented, even in this
plenitude of power, to depart from &s;ome articles of Hen|ry
I. 's charter, which they made the foundation of their
demands, particularly from the abolition of ward&s;hips,
&s;o important a point; and they &s;eem to have been &s;uffi|ciently
careful not to dimini&s;h too far the power and re|venue
of the crown. If they appear, therefore, to have
carried other demands to too great a height, it can be
a&s;cribed only to the faithle&s;s and tyrannical character of
the King him&s;elf, of which they had long had experi|ence,
and which, they fore&s;aw, would, if they provided
no farther &s;ecurity, lead him &s;oon to infringe their liber|ties,
and recall his own conce&s;&s;ions. This alone gave
birth to tho&s;e other articles, &s;eemingly exorbitant, which
were added as a rampart for the &s;afeguard of the Great Charter.</P>
<P>THE barons obliged the King to agree, that London
&s;hould remain in their hands, and the Tower be con|&s;igned
to the cu&s;tody of the primate, till the 15th of Au|gu&s;t

he allowed them to choo&s;e five and twenty members
from their own body, as con&s;ervators of the public liber|ties;
and no bounds were &s;et to the authority of the&s;e
men either in extent or duration. If any complaint was
made of a violation of the charter, whether by the King,
ju&s;ticiaries, &s;heriffs, or fore&s;ters, any four of the&s;e barons
might admoni&s;h the King to redre&s;s the grievance; and
if &s;atisfaction was not obtained, they could a&s;&s;emble the
whole council of twenty-five; who, in conjunction with
the great council, were empowered to compel him to ob|&s;erve
the charter, and, in ca&s;e of re&s;i&s;tance, might levy
war again&s;t him, attack his ca&s;tles, and employ every
kind of violence, except again&s;t his royal per&s;on, and
that of this Queen and children. All men, throughout
the kingdom, were bound, under the penalty of confi$|cation,
to &s;wear obedience to the five and twenty ba|rons;
and the freeholders of each county were to choo&s;e
twelve knights, who were to make report of &s;uch evil

<P>INNOCENT, con&s;idering him&s;elf as feudal lord of the

who, tho' they pretended to appeal to his authority, had
dared, without waiting for his con&s;ent, to impo&s;e &s;uch
terms on a prince, who, by re&s;igning to the Roman pon|tiff
his crown and independance, had placed him&s;elf im|mediately
under the papal protection. He i&s;&s;ued, there|fore,
a bull, in which, from the plenitude of his apo&s;to|lic
power, and from the authority, which God had com|mitted
to him, to build and de&s;troy kingdoms, to plant
and overthrow, he annulled and vacated the whole char|ter,
as unju&s;t in it&s;elf, as obtained by compul&s;ion, and as
derogatory to the dignity of the apo&s;tolic &s;ee. He prohi|bited
the barons to exact the ob&s;ervance of it: He even
prohibited the King him&s;elf to pay any regard to it: He
ab&s;olved him and his &s;ubjects from all oaths, which they
had been con&s;trained to take to that purpo&s;e: And he de|nounced
a general &s;entence of excommunication again&s;t

<P>THE King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Renewal of the civil wars.</NOTE> as his foreign forces arrived along with

tho' he was cited to Rome, that he might attend a gene|ral

<P>THE barons, after obtaining the great charter, &s;eem
to have been lulled into a fatal &s;ecurity, and to have ta|ken
no rational mea&s;ures, in ca&s;e of the introduction of
a foreign force, for re-a&s;&s;embling their armies. The
King was from the fir&s;t matter of the field; and imme|diately
laid &s;iege to the ca&s;tle of Roche&s;ter, which was
ob&s;tinately defended by William de Albiney, at the
head of an hundred and forty knights with their retain|ers,
and was at la&s;t reduced by famine. John,<NOTE PLACE="marg">30th Nov.</NOTE> irritated
with the re&s;i&s;tance, intended to have hanged the govern|or
and all the garri&s;on; but on the repre&s;entation of
William de Mauleon, who &s;ugge&s;ted to him the danger

manner, the inferior pri&s;oners only<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 187.</NOTE>. The cap|tivity
of William de Albiney, the be&s;t officer among the

cau&s;e; and no regular oppo&s;ition was thenceforth made
to the progre&s;s of the royal arms. The ravenous and

barbarous mercenaries, incited by a cruel and inraged
prince, were let loo&s;e again&s;t the e&s;tates, tenants, ma|nors,
hou&s;es, parks of the barons, and &s;pread deva&s;ta|tion
over the face of the kingdom. Nothing was &s;een
but the flames of villages and ca&s;tles reduced to a&s;hes,

England, from Dover to Berwick, laid the provinces
wa&s;te on each &s;ide of him; and con&s;idered every e&s;tate,
which was not his immediate property, as entirely ho&s;tile
and the object of military execution. The nobility of
the north in particular, who had &s;hown greate&s;t violence
in the recovery of their liberties, and who, acting in a
&s;eparate body, had expre&s;&s;ed their di&s;content even at the
conce&s;&s;ions made by the great charter; as they could ex|pect
no mercy, fled before him with their wives and fa|milies,
and purcha&s;ed the friendship of Alexander, the
young King of Scots, by doing homage to him<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Chron. de Mailr. p. 190. Heming. p. 558.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE barons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince Lewis called over.</NOTE> reduced to this de&s;perate extremity, and
menaced with the total lo&s;s of their liberties, their pro|perties,
and their lives, employed a remedy no le&s;s de&s;|perate;
and making applications to the court of France,
offered to acknowledge Lewis, the elde&s;t &s;on of Philip,
for their &s;overeign; on condition, that he afforded them
protection from the violence of their enraged prince<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">M. We&s;t. p. 274. Knyghton, p. 2423.</NOTE>.
Tho' the &s;en&s;e of the common rights of mankind, the
only rights which are entirely indefea&s;ible, might have
<PB N="97" REF="110">
justified them in their depo&s;ition of the King; they de|clined
in&s;i&s;ting before Philip,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1216.</NOTE> on a preten&s;ion, which is
commonly &s;o unfavourable among &s;overeigns, and which
is &s;ounds har&s;hly in their royal ears. They affirmed, that
John was incapable of &s;ucceeding to the crown, by rea|&s;on
of the attainder, pa&s;&s;ed upon him during his brother's
reign; tho' that attainder had been rever&s;ed, and Rich|ard
had even, by his la&s;t will, declared him his &s;ucce&s;&s;or.
They pretended, that he was already legally depo&s;ed by &s;entence
of the peers of France, on account of the mur|der
of his nephew; tho' that &s;entence could not po&s;&s;ibly
regard any thing but his tran&s;marine dominions, which
alone he held in homage to that crown. On more plau|&s;ible
grounds, they affirmed, that he had already depo&s;ed
him&s;elf by doing homage to the Pope, changing the na|ture
of his &s;overeignty, and re&s;igning an independant
crown for a fee or va&s;&s;alage under a foreign power. And
as Blanche of Ca&s;tille, the wife of Lewis, was de&s;cend|ed
by her mother from Henry II. they maintained, tho'
many other princes &s;tood before her in the order of &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion,
that they had not &s;haken off the royal family in
choosing her hu&s;band for their &s;overeign.</P>
<P>PHILIP was extremely tempted to lay hold of the rich
prize which was offered to him. The Pope's legate me|naced
him with interdicts and excommunications, if he
invaded the patrimony of St. Peter, or attacked a prince,
who was under the immediate protection of the holy
&s;ee<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 194. M. We&s;t. p. 275.</NOTE>; but as Philip was a&s;&s;ured of the obedience of his
own va&s;&s;als, his principles were changed with the con|junctures
of the times, and he now undervalued as much
all papal cen&s;ures, as he formerly pretended to pay re|&s;pect
to them. His chief &s;cruple was with regard to the
fidelity, which he might expect of the Engli&s;h barons in
their new engagements, and the danger of entru&s;ting his
<PB N="98" REF="111">
&s;on and heir into the hands of men, who might, on any
caprice or nece&s;&s;ity, make peace with their native &s;ove|reign,
by &s;acrificing a pledge of &s;o much value. He
therefore exacted from the barons twenty-five ho&s;tages
of the mo&s;t noble birth in the kingdom<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 193. Chron. Dun&s;t. vol. i. p. 74.</NOTE>; and having
obtained this &s;ecurity, he fir&s;t &s;ent over a &s;mall army to
the relief of the confederates, and then more numer|ous
forces, who arrived with Lewis him&s;elf at their head.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t effect of the young prince's appearance in
England was the de&s;ertion of John's foreign troops,
who, being mo&s;tly levied in Flanders, and other provin|ces
of France, refu&s;ed to &s;erve again&s;t the heir of their
monarchy<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 195.</NOTE>. The Ga&s;cons and Poictevins alone, who
were &s;till John's &s;ubjects, adhered to his cau&s;e; but they
were too weak to maintain that &s;uperiority in the field,
which they had hitherto &s;upported again&s;t the confede|rated
barons. Many con&s;iderable noblemen de&s;erted
John's party, the earls of Sali&s;bury, Arundel, War|renne,
Oxford, Albemarle, and William Mare&s;chal the
younger: His ca&s;tles fell daily into the hands of the ene|my:
Dover was the only place, which, from the valour
and fidelity of Hubert de Burgh, the governor, made re|&s;i&s;tance
to the progre&s;s of Lewis's arms<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 198. Chron. Dun&s;t vol. i, p. 75, 76.</NOTE>: And the ba|rons
had the melancholy pro&s;pect of finally &s;ucceeding in their purpo&s;e, and of e&s;caping the tyranny of their own
King, by impo&s;ing on them&s;elves and the nation a fo|reign
yoke. But this union was of very &s;hort duration
between the French and Engli&s;h nobles; and the impru|dence
of Lewis, who on every occa&s;ion &s;howed too vi|&s;ible
a preference to the former, encrea&s;ed that jealou&s;y,
which it was &s;o natural for the latter to entertain in their
<PB N="99" REF="112">
pre&s;ent &s;ituation<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">W. Heming. p. 559.</NOTE>. The vi&s;count of Melun, too, it is
&s;aid, one of his courtiers, fell &s;ick at London, and find|ing
the approaches of death, he &s;ent for &s;ome of his
friends among the Engli&s;h barons, and warning them of
their danger, revealed Lewis's &s;ecret intentions of exter|minating
them and their families as traitors to their
prince, and be&s;towing their e&s;tates and dignities on his
native &s;ubjects, in who&s;e fidelity he could more rea&s;on|ably
place confidence<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 199. M. We&s;t. p. 277.</NOTE>. This &s;tory, whether true or
fal&s;e, was univer&s;ally reported and believed; and concur|ring
with other circum&s;tances, which rendered it cre|dible,
did an infinite prejudice to Lewis's cau&s;e. The
earl of Sali&s;bury and other noblemen de&s;erted again to
John's party<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Chron. Dun&s;t. vol. $word$. p. 78.</NOTE>; and as men ea&s;ily change &s;ides in a civil
war, e&s;pecially where their power is founded on an he|reditary
and independant authority, and is not derived
from the opinion and favour of the people, the French
prince had rea&s;on to dread a &s;udden rever&s;e of fortune.
The King was a&s;&s;embling a con&s;iderable army, with a
view of fighting one great battle for his crown; but
pa&s;&s;ing from Lynne to Lincoln&s;hire, his road lay along
the &s;ea-&s;hore, which was overflowed at high water; and
not choo&s;ing the proper time for his journey, he lo&s;t in
the inundation all his carriages, trea&s;ure, baggage, and
regalia. The affliction of this di&s;a&s;ter, and the vexation
from the di&s;tracted &s;tate of his affairs, encrea&s;ed the &s;ick|ne&s;s,
under which he then laboured; and tho' he reach|ed
the ca&s;tle of Newark, he was obliged to halt there,
and his di&s;temper &s;oon after put an end to his life, in the
forty-ninth year of his reign;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death</NOTE> and freed the nation from
the dangers, to which it was equally expo&s;ed, by his
&s;ucce&s;s or his misfortunes.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="113">
THE character of this prince is nothing but a compli|cation
of vices,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and character of the King.</NOTE> equally mean and odious; ruinous to
him&s;elf, and de&s;tructive to his people. Cowardice, in|activity,
folly, levity, licentiou&s;ne&s;s, ingratitude, trea|chery,
tyranny, and cruelty; all the&s;e qualities appear
too evidently in the &s;everal incidents of his life to give
us room to &s;u&s;pect, that the di&s;agreeable picture has been
anywi&s;e overcharged by the prejudice of the antient hi&s;to|rians.
It is hard to &s;ay, whether his conduct to his fa|ther,
his brother, his nephew, or his &s;ubjects was mo&s;t
culpable; or whether his crimes in the&s;e re&s;pects were
not even exceeded by the ba&s;ene&s;s, which appeared in
his tran&s;actions with the King of France, the Pope, and
the barons. His dominions, when they devolved to him
by the death of his brother, were more exten&s;ive than
have, ever &s;ince his time, been ruled by any Engli&s;h
monarch: But he fir&s;t lo&s;t by his mi&s;conduct the flou|ri&s;hing
provinces in France, the antient patrimony of his
family: He &s;ubjected his kingdom to a &s;hameful va&s;&s;alage
under the &s;ee of Rome: He &s;aw the prerogatives of his
crown dimini&s;hed by law, and &s;till more reduced by fac|tion:
And he died at la&s;t, when in danger of being to|tally
expelled by a foreign power, and of either ending
his life mi&s;erably in pri&s;on, or &s;eeking &s;helter as a fugi|tive
from the pur&s;uit of his enemies.</P>
<P>THE prejudices again&s;t this prince were &s;o violent,
that he was believed to have &s;ent an emba&s;&s;y to the Mi|ramoulin
or Emperor of Morocco, and to have offered
to change his religion and become Mahometan, in order
to purcha&s;e the protection of that monarch. But tho'
that &s;tory is told us, on plau&s;ible authority, by Matthew
Paris<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">P. 169.</NOTE>, it is in it&s;elf utterly improbable; except, that
there is nothing &s;o incredible as may not become likely
from the folly and wickedne&s;s of John.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="114">
THE monks throw great reproaches on this prince for
his impiety and even infidelity; and as an in&s;tance of it,
they tell us, that having, one day, caught a very fat
&s;tag, he exclaimed, <HI>How plump and well fed is this ani|mael;
and yet I dare &s;wear he never heard ma&s;s</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. $70.</NOTE>. This
&s;ally of wit, upon the u&s;ual corpulency of the prie&s;ts,
more than all his enormous crimes and iniquities, made
him pa&s;s with them for an athei&s;t.</P>
<P>JOHN left two legitimate &s;ons behind him, Henry,
born on the fir&s;t of October, 1207, and now nine years
of age; and Richard, born on the &s;ixth of January,
1209; and three daughters, Jane married to Alexander
King of Scots; Eleanor married fir&s;t to William Mare|chal
younger, earl of Pembroke, and then to Simon
Mountfort, earl of Leice&s;ter; and I&s;abella married to the
Emperor, Frederic II. All the&s;e children were born to

<P><PB N="103" REF="116">
AFTER the northern nations &s;ubdued the provinces of
the Roman empire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Origin of the feudal law.</NOTE> they were obliged to e&s;tabli&s;h a
&s;y&s;tem of government, which might &s;ecure their con|que&s;ts,
as well again&s;t the revolt of their numerous &s;ub|jects,
who remained in the provinces, as from the inroads
of other tribes, who might be tempted to ravi&s;h from
them their new acqui&s;itions. The great change of cir|cum&s;tances
made them here depart from tho&s;e in&s;titutions,
which prevailed among them, while they remained in
the fore&s;ts of Germany; yet was it &s;till natural for them
to retain, in their pre&s;ent &s;ettlement, as much of their
antient cu&s;toms as was compatible with their new &s;itua|tion.</P>
<P>THE German governments, being more a confederacy
of independant warriors, than a civil &s;ubjection, derived
their principal force from many inferior and voluntary
a&s;&s;ociations, which individuals formed under a particu|lar
head or chieftain, and which it became the highe&s;t
point of honour to maintain with inviolable fidelity. The
glory of the chieftain con&s;i&s;ted in the number, the bra|very,
and the zealous attachment of his retainers: The
duty of the retainers required that they &s;hould accom|pany
their chieftain in all wars and dangers, that they
&s;hould fight and peri&s;h by his &s;ide, and that they &s;hould
e&s;teem his renown or his favour a &s;ufficient recompence
for all their &s;ervices<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Tacit. de Mor. Germ.</NOTE>. The prince him&s;elf was nothing
but a great chieftain, who was cho&s;en from among the
re&s;t, on account of his &s;uperior valour or nobility; and
who derived his power from the voluntary a&s;&s;ociation or
attachment of the other chieftains.</P>
<P>WHEN a tribe, governed by tho&s;e ideas, and actuated
by tho&s;e principles, &s;ubdued a large territory, they found,
that tho' it was nece&s;&s;ary to keep them&s;elves in a mili|tary
<PB N="104" REF="117">
po&s;ture, they could neither remain united in a body,
nor take up their quarters in &s;everal garri&s;ons, and that
their manners and in&s;titutions debarred them from u&s;ing
tho&s;e expedients; the obvious ones, which, in a like &s;i|tuation,
would have been employed by a civilized nation.
Their ignorance in the art of finances, and perhaps the
deva&s;tations in&s;eparable from &s;uch violent conque&s;ts, ren|dered
it impracticable for them to levy taxes &s;ufficient for
the pay of numerous armies; and their repugnance to a
&s;lavi&s;h &s;ubordination, with their attachment to rural plea|&s;ures,
made the life of the camp or garri&s;on, if perpe|tuated
during peaceful times, extremely odious and di&s;|gu&s;tful
to them. They &s;eized, therefore, &s;uch a propor|tion
of the conquered lands as appeared nece&s;&s;ary; they
a&s;&s;igned a &s;hare for &s;upporting the dignity of their prince
and government; they di&s;tributed other parts, under the
title of fiefs, to the chieftains; the&s;e made a new parti|tion
among their retainers; the expre&s;s condition of all
the&s;e grants was, that they might be re&s;umed at plea&s;ure,
and that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, &s;o long as he enjoyed them, &s;hould
&s;till remain in readine&s;s to take the field for the defence
of the nation. And tho' the conquerors immediately &s;e|parated,
in order to enjoy their new acqui&s;itions, their
martial di&s;po&s;ition made them readily fulfil the terms of
their engagement: They a&s;&s;embled on the fir&s;t alarm;
their habitual attachment to the chieftain made them wil|lingly
&s;ubmit to his command; and thus a regular mili|tary
force, tho' concealed, lay always ready, to defend,
on any emergence, the intere&s;t and honour of the com|munity.</P>
<P>WE are not to imagine, that all or even the greate&s;t
part of the conquered lands was &s;eized by. the northern
conquerors; or that the whole of the land thus &s;eized
was &s;ubjected to the&s;e military &s;ervices. This &s;uppo&s;i|tion
is confuted by the hi&s;tory of all the nations on the
<PB N="105" REF="118">
continent. Even the idea given us of the German man|ners
by the Roman hi&s;torian, may convince us, that that
bold people would never have been contented with &s;o
precarious a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, or have fought to procure e&s;ta|bli&s;hments,
which were only to continue during the
good plea&s;ure of their &s;overeign. Tho' the northern
chie$tains accepted of lands, which, being con&s;idered as
a kind of military-pay, might be re&s;umed at the will of
the King or general; they al&s;o took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of e&s;tates,
which, being hereditary and independant, enabled them
to maintain their native liberty, and &s;upport, without
court-favour, the honour of their rank and family.</P>
<P>BUT there is a great difference,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Progre&s;s of the feudal|law.</NOTE> in the con&s;equences,
between the di&s;tribution of a pecuniary &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and
the a&s;&s;ignment of lands burdened with the condition of
military &s;ervice. The delivery of the former at the
weekly, monthly, or annual terms of payment, &s;till re|calls
the idea of a voluntary gratuity from the prince,
and reminds the &s;oldier of the precarious tenure by which
he holds his commi&s;&s;ion. But the attachment naturally
formed with a fixed portion of land, gradually begets
the idea of &s;omething like property, and makes the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or
forget his dependant &s;ituation, and the condition
which was at fir&s;t annexed to the grant. It &s;eemed equi|table,
that one who had cultivated and &s;owed a field,
should reap the harve&s;t: Hence fiefs, which were at fir&s;t
entirely precarious, were &s;oon made annual. A man,
who had employed his money in building, planting, or
other improvements, expected to reap the fruits of his
labour or expence: Hence they were next granted
during a term of years. It would be thought hard to
expel a man from his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, who had always done
his duty, and performed the conditions on which he ori|ginally
received them: Hence the chieftains, in a &s;ub|&s;equent
period, thought them&s;elves entitled to demand
<PB N="106" REF="119">
the enjoyment of their feudal lands during life. It was
found, that a man would, in battle, hazard his life more
willingly, if a&s;&s;ured, that his family &s;hould inherit his
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and &s;hould not be expo&s;ed by his death to
want and poverty: Hence fiefs were made hereditary in
families, and de&s;cended, during one age, to the &s;on;
then to the grand&s;on, next to the brothers, and after|wards
to more di&s;tant relations<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Lib. Feud. Lib. 1. tit. 1.</NOTE>. The idea of property
&s;tole in gradually upon that of military pay; and each
century made &s;ome &s;en&s;ible addition to the &s;tability of
fiefs and tenures.</P>
<P>IN all the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ive acqui&s;itions, the chieftain was
&s;upported by his va&s;&s;als; who, having originally a &s;trong
connexion with him, augmented by the con&s;tant inter|cour&s;e
of good offices, and by the friendships ari&s;ing from
neighbourhood and dependance, were inclined to follow
their leader again&s;t all his enemies, and voluntarily, in
his private quarrels, pay him the &s;ame obedience, to
which by their tenure they were bound in foreign wars.
While he daily advanced new preten&s;ions to &s;ecure the
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his &s;uperior fief, they expected to find the
&s;ame advantage in acquiring &s;tability to their &s;ubordinate
ones; and they zealou&s;ly oppo&s;ed the intru&s;ion of a new
lord, who would be inclined, as he was fully intitled,
to be&s;tow the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their lands on his own fa|vourites
and retainers. The authority of the &s;overeign
gradually decayed; and the nobles, fortified each in his
own territory by the attachment of his va&s;&s;als, became
too powerful to be expelled by an order from the throne;
and he &s;ecured by law what he had at fir&s;t acquired by
u&s;urpation.</P>
<P>DURING this precarious &s;tate of the &s;upreme power, a
difference would immediately be experienced between
tho&s;e portions of territory which were &s;ubjected to the
<PB N="107" REF="120">
feudal tenures, and tho&s;e which were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by an al|lodial
or free title. Tho' the latter po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions had at
fir&s;t been e&s;teemed infinitely preferable, they were &s;oon
found, by the progre&s;&s;ive changes introduced into public
and private law, to be of a much inferior condition to
the former. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of a feudal territory, united
by a regular &s;ubordination under one chieftain, and by
the mutual attachments of the va&s;&s;als, had the &s;ame ad|vantages
over the proprietors of the other, which a di&s;|ciplined
army enjoys over a di&s;per&s;ed multitude; and
were enabled to commit with impunity all injuries on
their defencele&s;s neighbours. Every one, therefore,
ha&s;tened to &s;eek that protection which he found &s;o ne|ce&s;&s;ary;
and each allodial proprietor, re&s;igning his po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions
into the hands of the King, or of &s;ome noble|man
re&s;pected for power or valour, received them back
with the condition of feudal &s;ervices<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Marculf. Form. 47. apud Lindenbr. p. 1238.</NOTE>, which, tho' a
burden &s;omewhat grievous, brought him ample compen|&s;ation,
by connecting him with the neighbouring pro|prietors,
and placing him under the guardian&s;hip of a
potent chieftain. The decay of the political government
thus nece&s;&s;arily occa&s;ioned the exten&s;ion of the feudal:
The kingdoms of Europe were univer&s;ally divided into
baronies, and the&s;e into inferior fiefs: And the attach|ment
of va&s;&s;als to their chieftain, which was at fir&s;t an
e&s;&s;ential part of the German manners, was &s;till &s;upported
by the &s;ame cau&s;es from which it at fir&s;t aro&s;e; the ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of mutual protection, and the continued inter|cour&s;e,
between the head and the members, of benefits and &s;ervices.</P>
<P>BUT there was another circum&s;tance, which corrobo|rated
the&s;e feudal dependancies, and tended to connect
the va&s;&s;als with their &s;uperior lord by an indi&s;&s;oluble
bond of union. The northern conquerors, as well as

more early Greeks and Romans, embraced a policy;
which is unavoidable to all nations that have made &s;len|der
advances in refinement; and they every where united
the civil juri&s;diction with the military power. Law, in
its commencement, was not an intricate &s;cience, and
was more governed by maxims of equity, which &s;eem
obvious to common &s;en&s;e, than by numerous and &s;ubtile
principles, applied to a variety of ca&s;es by profound rea|&s;onings
from analogy. An officer, tho' he had pa&s;&s;ed
his life in the field, was able to determine all legal con|trover&s;ies
which could occur within the di&s;trict committed
to his charge; and his deci&s;ions were the mo&s;t likely to
meet with a prompt and ready obedience, from men who
re&s;pected his per&s;on, and were accu&s;tomed to act under
his command. The profit ari&s;ing from puni&s;hments,
which were then chiefly pecuniary, was another rea&s;on
for his de&s;iring to retain the judicial power; and when his
fief became hereditary, this authority, which was e&s;&s;ential
to it, was al&s;o tran&s;mitted to his po&s;terity. The counts
and other magi&s;trates, who&s;e power was merely official,
were tempted, in $span$ feudal lords, whom
they re&s;embled in &s;o $span$, to render their
dignity perpetual and he$$$itary; and in the decline of
the regal power, they found no difficulty to make good
their preten&s;ions. After this manner, the va&s;t fabric of
feudal &s;ubordination became quite &s;olid and comprehen|&s;ive;
it formed every where an e&s;&s;ential part of the poli|tical
con&s;titution; and the Norman and other barons,
who followed the fortunes of William, were &s;o accu&s;|tomed
to it, that they could &s;carce form an idea of any
other &s;pecies of civil government<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">The ideas of the feudal government were &s;o rooted, that even lawyers, in tho&s;e ages, could not form a notion of any other con&s;titu|tion. <HI>Regnum,</HI> (&s;ays Bracton, lib. 2. cap&punc; 34.) <HI>quod ex comitatibus &amp; baronibus dicitur e&s;&s;$ con&s;titutum.</HI></NOTE>.</P>

THE Saxons, who conquered England, as they exter|minated
the antient inhabitants, and were &s;ecured by the
&s;ea again&s;t new invaders, found it le&s;s requi&s;ite to main|tain
them&s;elves in a military po&s;ture; and the quantity
of land which they annexed to offices, &s;eems to have
been of &s;mall value; and for that rea&s;on continued the
longer in its original &s;ituation, and was always po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
during plea&s;ure by tho&s;e entru&s;ted with the command.
The&s;e conditions were too precarious to &s;atisfy the Nor|man
chieftains, who enjoyed more independant po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|ons
and juri&s;dictions in their own country; and Wil|liam
was obliged, in the new di&s;tribution of land, to
copy the tenures, which were now become univer&s;al on
the continent. England of a &s;udden became a feudal
kingdom<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Coke Comm. on Lit. p. 1, 2. ad &s;ect. 1.</NOTE>; and received all the advantages, and was
expo&s;ed to all the inconveniences, incident to that &s;pecies
of civil polity.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to the principles of the feudal law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The feudal govern|ment of England.</NOTE> the
King was the &s;upreme lord of the landed property; and
all po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, who enjoyed the fruits or revenue of any
part of it, held the&s;e privileges, either mediately or im|mediately,
of him; and their property was conceived to
be, in &s;ome degree, conditional<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Som$er of Gaveik. p. 109. Smith de Rep. lib, 3 cap. 10.</NOTE>. The land was &s;till
apprehended to be a &s;pecies of <HI>benefice,</HI> which was the
original conception of a feudal property; and the vassal
owed, in return for it, &s;tated &s;ervices to his baron, as
the baron him&s;elf did for his land to the crown. The
va&s;&s;al was obliged to defend his baron in war; and the
baron, at the head of his va&s;&s;als, was bound to fight in
defence of the King and kingdom. But be&s;ides the&s;e
military &s;ervices, which were ca&s;ual, there were others
impo&s;ed of a civil nature, which were more con&s;tant and
perpetual.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="125">
THE northern nations had no idea, that any man,
trained up to honour, or enured to arms, was ever to be
governed, without his own con&s;ent, by the ab&s;olute will
of another; or that the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice was ever
to be exerci&s;ed by the private opinion of any one
magi&s;trate, without the concurrence of &s;ome other per|&s;ons,
who&s;e intere&s;t might induce them to check his ar|bitrary
and iniquitous deci&s;ions. The King, therefore,
when he found it nece&s;&s;ary to demand any &s;ervices
of his barons or chief tenants, beyond what was due
by their tenures, was obliged to a&s;&s;emble them, in order
to procure their <HI>consent:</HI> And when it was nece&s;&s;ary to
determine any controver&s;y among the barons them&s;elves,
the que&s;tion mu&s;t be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in their pre&s;ence, and be
decided according to their opinion or <HI>advice.</HI> In these
two circum&s;tances of con&s;ent and advice, con&s;i&s;ted chiefly
the civil &s;ervices of the ancient barons; and the&s;e im|plied
all the con&s;iderable incidents of governments. In
one view, the barons regarded, this attendance as their
principal <HI>privilege;</HI> in another, as a grievous <HI>burden.</HI>
That no momentous affairs could be tran&s;acted without
their con&s;ent and advice, was in <HI>general</HI> e&s;teemed the
great &s;ecurity of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and. dignities; but as
they reaped no immediate profit from their attendance at
court, and were expo&s;ed to great inconvenience and
charge by an ab&s;ence from their own e&s;tates, every one
was glad to exempt him&s;elf from each <HI>particular</HI> exertion
of this power; and was plea&s;ed both that the call for
that duty &s;hould &s;eldom return upon him, and that others
&s;hould undergo the burden in his &s;tead. The King, on
the other hand, was u&s;ually anxious, for &s;everal rea|&s;ons,
that the a&s;&s;embly of the barons &s;hould be full
at every &s;tated or ca&s;ual time of meeting: This at|tendance
was the chief badge of their &s;ubordination to
<PB N="111" REF="126">
his crown, and drew them from that independence
which they were apt to affect in their own ca&s;tles
and manors; and where the meeting was thin or ill at|tended,
its determinations had le&s;s authority, and were
not followed by &s;o ready an obedience from the whole
community.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;e was the &s;ame with the barons in their
courts as with the King in the &s;upreme council of the
nation. It was requi&s;ite to a&s;&s;emble the va&s;&s;als, in order
to determine by their vote any que&s;tion which regarded
the barony; and they &s;at along with the chieftain in all
trials, whether civil or criminal, which occurred within
the limits of their juri&s;diction. They were bound to
pay &s;uit and &s;ervice at the court of their baron; and as
their tenure was military, and con&s;equently honour|able,
they were admitted into his &s;ociety, and partook
of his friend&s;hip. Thus, a kingdom was only con&s;i|dered
as a great barony, and a barony as a &s;mall king|dom.
The barons were peers to each other in the na|tional
council, and, in &s;ome degree, companions to the
King: The va&s;&s;als were peers to each other in the court
of barony, and companions to their baron.<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Du Cange Glo&s;&s;. in verb. <HI>Par.</HI> $ujac. Common. in Lib. F$ud. lib. I. tit. p. 18. Spelm. Glo&s;&s;. in verb,</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT tho' this re&s;emblance &s;o far took place, the va&s;|&s;als,
by the natural cour&s;e of things, univer&s;ally, in the
feudal con&s;titutions, fell into a greater &s;ubordination un|der
the baron, than the baron him&s;elf under his &s;ove|reign;
and the&s;e governments had a nece&s;&s;ary and infal|lible
tendency to augment the power of the nobles.
The great chieftain, re&s;iding in his country-&s;eat or ca&s;tle,
which he was commonly allowed to fortify, lo&s;t, in a
great mea&s;ure, his connexion or acquaintance with the
prince; and added every day new force to his autho|rity
<PB N="112" REF="127">
over the va&s;&s;als of the barony. They received from
him education in all military exerci&s;es: His ho&s;pitality
invited them to live and enjoy &s;ociety in his hall: Their
lei&s;ure, which was great, made them perpetual retainers
on his per&s;on, and partakers of his country &s;ports and
amu&s;ements: They had no means of gratifying their
ambition but by making a figure in his train:
His favour and countenance was their greate&s;t honour:
His di&s;plea&s;ure expo&s;ed them to contempt and igno|miny:
And they felt every moment the nece&s;&s;ity of
his protection, both in the controver&s;ies which occur|red
with other va&s;&s;als, and what was more material,
in the daily inroads and injuries which were commit|ted
by the neighbouring barons. During the time of
general war, the &s;overeign, who marched at the head
of his armies, and was the great protector of the &s;tate,
acquired always &s;ome acce&s;&s;ion to his authority, which
he lo&s;t during the intervals of peace and tranquillity:
But the loo&s;e police incident to the feudal con&s;titu|tions,
maintained a perpetual, tho' &s;ecret ho&s;tility, be|tween
the &s;everal members of the &s;tate; and the va&s;&s;als
found no other means of &s;ecurity again&s;t the injuries to.
which they were continually expo&s;ed, but by clo&s;ely
adhering to their chieftain, and falling into a &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ive
dependance upon him.</P>
<P>IF the feudal government was &s;o little favourable to
the true liberty even of the military va&s;&s;al, it was &s;till
more de&s;tructive of the independance and &s;ecurity of
the other members of the &s;tate, or what in a proper
&s;en&s;e we call the people. A great part of them were
<HI>&s;erfs,</HI> and lived in &s;tate of ab&s;olute &s;lavery or villainage:
The other inhabitants of the country paid their rent in
&s;ervices which were in a great mea&s;ure arbitrary, and
they could expect no redre&s;s of injuries in a court of
barony from men who thought they had a right to
<PB N="113" REF="128">
oppre&s;s and tyrannize over them: The towns were
&s;ituated either within the deme&s;nes of the King, or
the lands of the great barons, and were almo&s;t en|tirely
&s;ubjected to the ab&s;olute will of their ma&s;ter.
The langui&s;hing &s;tate of commerce kept the inhabi|tants
poor and contemptible; and the political in&s;titu|tions
were calculated to render that poverty perpe|tual.
The barons and gentry, living in ru&s;tic plenty
and ho&s;pitality, gave no encouragement to the arts,
and had no demand for any of the more elaborate
produce of manufactures: Every profe&s;&s;ion was held
in contempt but that of arms: And if any merchant
or manufacturer ro&s;e by indu&s;try and frugality to a
degree of opulence, he found him&s;elf but the more
expo&s;ed to injuries, from the envy and avidity of the
military nobles.</P>
<P>THESE concurring cau&s;es gave the feudal govern|ments
&s;o &s;trong a bia&s;s towards ari&s;tocracy, that the
royal authority was extremely eclip&s;ed in all the Eu|ropean
&s;tates; and, in&s;tead of dreading the growth of
monarchical power, we might rather expect, that the
community would every where crumble into &s;o many
independent baronies, and lo&s;e the political union by
which they were cemented. In elective monarchies,
the event was commonly an&s;werable to this expecta|tion;
and the barons, gaining ground on every vacancy
of the throne, rai&s;ed them&s;elves almo&s;t to a &s;tate of
&s;overeignty, and &s;acrificed to their power both the
rights of the crown and the liberties of the people.
But hereditary monarchies had a principle of authority,
which was not &s;o ea&s;ily &s;ubverted; and there were &s;e|veral
cau&s;es, which &s;till maintained a degree of influ|ence
in the hands of the &s;overeign.</P>
<P>THE greate&s;t baron could never lo&s;e view entirely
of tho&s;e principles of the feudal con&s;titution, which
<PB N="114" REF="129">
bound him, as a va&s;&s;al, to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and fidelity to|wards
his prince; becau&s;e he was every moment obliged
to have recour&s;e to tho&s;e principles, in exacting fidelity
and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion from his own va&s;&s;als. The le&s;&s;er barons,
finding that the annihilation of royal authority left them
expo&s;ed without protection to the in&s;ults and injuries of
more potent neighbours, naturally adhered to the crown,
and promoted the execution of general and equal laws.
The people had &s;till a &s;tronger intere&s;t to de&s;ire the
grandeur of the &s;overeign; and the King, being the le|gal
magi&s;trate, who &s;uffered by every internal convul|&s;ion
or oppre&s;&s;ion, and who regarded the great nobles as
his immediate rivals, a&s;&s;umed the &s;alutary office of ge|neral
guardian or protector of the commons. Be&s;ides
the prerogatives with which the law endowed him; his
large deme&s;nes and numerous retainers rendered him, in
one &s;en&s;e, the greate&s;t baron of his kingdom; and where
he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of per&s;onal vigor and ability (for his
&s;ituation required the&s;e advantages) he was commonly
able to pre&s;erve his authority, and maintain his &s;tation
as head of the community, and the chief fountain of
law and ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t Kings of the Norman race were favoured by
another circum&s;tance, which pre&s;erved them from the en|croachments
of their barons. They were generals of a
conquering army, which was obliged to continue in a
military po&s;ture, and to maintain great &s;ubordination
under their leader, in order to &s;ecure them&s;elves from
the revolt of the numerous natives, whom they had be|$eaved
of all their properties and privileges. But tho'
this circum&s;tance &s;upported the authority of William
and his immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and rendered them ex|tremely
ab&s;olute, it was lo&s;t as &s;oon as the Norman ba|rons
began to coale&s;ce with the nation, to acquire a &s;e|curity
in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and to fix their influence
<PB N="115" REF="130">
over their va&s;&s;als, tenants, and &s;laves. And the immen&s;e

title: By pre&s;cription, as having always po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that
privilege, thro' the whole Saxon period, from the fir&s;t
e&s;tabli&s;hment of Chri&s;tianity; and by their right of ba|ronage,
as holding of the King <HI>in capite</HI> by military &s;er|vice.
The&s;e two titles of the prelates were never accu|rately
di&s;tingui&s;hed. When the u&s;urpations of the church
had ri&s;en to &s;uch a height, as to make the bi&s;hops affect
a &s;eparate dominion, and regard their &s;eat in parliament
as a degradation of their epi&s;copal dignity; the King
in&s;i&s;ted, that they were barons, and on that account,
obliged, by the general principles of the feudal law, to
attend on him in his great councils<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Spel. Glo&s;&s;. in verb. <HI>Bars.</HI></NOTE>. Yet there &s;till re|mained
&s;ome practices, which &s;uppo&s;ed their title to be
derived merely from antient po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: When a bi&s;hop
was elected, he &s;at in parliament before the King had
made him re&s;titution of his temporalities; and during
the vacancy of a fee, the guardian of the &s;piritualities
was &s;ummoned to attend along with the bi&s;hops.</P>
<P>THE barons were another con&s;tituent part of the great
council of the nation. The&s;e held immediately of the
crown by a military tenure: They were the mo&s;t honourable
members of the &s;tate, and had a <HI>right</HI> to be
<PB N="117" REF="132">
con&s;ulted in all public deliberations: They were the im|mediate
va&s;&s;als of the crown, and owed as a <HI>&s;ervice</HI> their
attendance in the court of their &s;upreme lord. A re|&s;olution,
taken, without their con&s;ent, was likely to be but
ill executed: And no determination of any cau&s;e or con|trover&s;y
among them had any validity, where the vote
and advice of the whole body did not concur. The dignity
of earl or count was official and territorial, as well
as hereditary; and as all the earls were al&s;o barons, they
were con&s;idered as military va&s;&s;als of the crown, were
admitted in that capacity into the general council, and
formed the mo&s;t honourable and powerful branch of it.</P>
<P>BUT there was another cla&s;s of the immediate military
tenants of the crown, equally numerous with the barons,
the tenants <HI>in captite</HI> by knights &s;ervice; and the&s;e, however
inferior in power or property, held by a tenure, which
was equally honourable as that of the others. A barony
was commonly compo&s;ed of &s;everal knights fees: and
tho' the number &s;eems not to have been exactly defined,
&s;eldom con&s;i&s;ted of le&s;s than forty hydes of land<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Four hydes made one knight's fee: The relief of a barony was twelve times greater than that of a knight's fee; whence we may con|lecture its value. Spelm. Glo&s;&s;. in verb$ <HI>Feodum.</HI></NOTE>: But
where a man held of the King only one or two knights
fees, he was &s;till an immediate va&s;&s;al of the King, and
as &s;uch had a title to have a &s;eat in the general councils.
But as this attendance was u&s;ually e&s;teemed a burthen,
and one too great for a man of &s;lender fortune to bear
con&s;tantly; it is probable, that tho' he had a title, if he
plea&s;ed, to be admitted, he was not obliged by any pe|nalty,
like the barons, to pay a regular attendance. All
the immediate military tenants of the crown amounted
not fully to 700, when Dome&s;day book was framed;
and as the members were well plea&s;ed, on any pretext,
to excu&s;e them&s;elves from attendance, the a&s;&s;embly was
<PB N="118" REF="133">
never likely on any occa&s;ion to become too numerous
for the di&s;patch of public bu&s;ine&s;s.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The com|mons.</NOTE></P>
<P>So far the nature of a general council or antient par|liament
is determined without any doubt or controver&s;y.
The only que&s;tion &s;eems to be with regard to the com|mons,
or the repre&s;entatives of counties and boroughs;
whether they were al&s;o, in more early times, con&s;tituent
parts of parliament? This que&s;tion was once di&s;puted in
England with great acrimony; but &s;uch is the force of
time and evidence, that they can &s;ometimes prevail even
over faction, and the que&s;tion &s;eems, by general con&s;ent,
and even by their own, to be at la&s;t determined again&s;t
the ruling party. It is agreed that the commons were no
part of the great council, till &s;ome ages after the con|que&s;t;
and that the military tenants alone of the crown
compo&s;ed that &s;upreme and legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>THE va&s;&s;als of a baron were by, their tenure immedi|ately
dependant on him, owed attendance at his court,
and paid all their duty to the King, thro' that depend|ance
which their lord was obliged by <HI>his</HI> tenure to
acknowledge to his &s;overeign and &s;uperior. Their land,
comprehended in the barony, was repre&s;ented in parlia|ment
by the baron him&s;elf, who was &s;uppo&s;ed, accord|ing
to the fictions of the feudal law, to po&s;&s;e&s;s the di|rect
property of it; and it would have been deemed in|congruous
to give it any other repre&s;entation. They
&s;tood in the &s;ame capacity to him, that he and the other
barons did to the King: The former were peers of the
barony; the latter were peers of the realm: The va&s;&s;als
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a &s;ubordinate rank within their di&s;trict; the
baron enjoyed a &s;upreme dignity in the great a&s;&s;embly:
They were in &s;ome degree his companions at home; he
the King's companion in the court: And nothing can
be more evidently repugnant to all feudal ideas, and to
that gradual &s;ubordination, which was e&s;&s;ential to tho&s;e
<PB N="119" REF="134">
antient in&s;titutions, than to imagine that the King would
apply either for the advice or con&s;ent of men, who were
of a rank or order &s;o much inferior, and who&s;e duty was
immediately paid to the <HI>me&s;ne</HI> lord, that was interpo&s;ed
between them and the throne<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Spelm. Glo&s;&s;. in verb. <HI>Baro.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>IF it be unrea&s;onable to think, that the va&s;&s;als of a
barony, tho' their tenure was military and noble and
honourable, were ever &s;ummoned to give their opinion
in national councils; much le&s;s can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that
the trade&s;men or inhabitants of boroughs, who&s;e con|dition
was &s;till &s;o much inferior, would be admitted to
that privilege. It appears from Dome&s;day, that the bo|roughs
were, at the time of the conque&s;t, &s;carce more
than country villages; and that the inhabitants lived in
entire dependance on the King or great lords, and were
of a &s;tation little better than &s;ervile<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Liber <HI>bomo</HI> antientiy &s;ignified a gentleman: For &s;car$e any one be&s;ide was entirely free. $pelm. Glo&s;&s;. in verbo.</NOTE>. They were not

which made more early advances in arts and civility than
England, the fir&s;t corporation is &s;ixty years po&s;terior to

<P>THE great &s;imilarity among all the feudal govern|ments
of Europe is well known to every man, that has
any acquaintance with antient hi&s;tory; and the antiqua|rians
of all foreign countries, where the que&s;tion was
never embara&s;&s;ed by party di&s;putes, have allowed, that
the commons were very late in being admitted to a
&s;hare in the legi&s;lative power. In Normandy particularly,
who&s;e con&s;titution was mo&s;t likely to be William's mo|del
in rai&s;ing his new fabric of the Engli&s;h government,
the &s;tates were entirely compo&s;ed of the clergy and nobi|lity;
and the fir&s;t incorporated boroughs or communities
of that dutchy were Ro$en and Falai&s;e, which enjoyed
their privileges by a grant of Philip Augu&s;tus in the
year 1207<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Norman. Du Che&s;nii, p. 1066. Da Cange Glo&s;&s;. in verb. <HI>comu$$$.</HI></NOTE>. All the antient Engli&s;h hi&s;torians, when
<PB N="121" REF="136">
they mention the great council of the nation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Appendix II.</NOTE> call it
an a&s;&s;embly of the baronage, nobility or great men; and
none of their expre&s;&s;ions, tho' &s;everal hundred pa&s;&s;ages
might be produced, can, without the utmo&s;t violence,
be tortured to a meaning, which will admit the com|mons
to be con&s;tituent members of that body<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Sometimes the hi&s;torians mention people, <HI>populus,</HI> as a part of the parliament: But they always mean the laity, in oppo&s;ition to the clergy. Sometimes, the word, <HI>communitas,</HI> is found; but it always means <HI>communitas baronagii.</HI> The&s;e points are clearly proved by Dr. Brady.</NOTE> The
<HI>magna charta</HI> of King John provides, that no tax or &s;cu|tage
&s;hould be impo&s;ed but by the con&s;ent of the great
council; and for more &s;ecurity, it enumerates the per&s;ons
intitled to a feat in that council, the prelates and
immediate tenants of the crown, without any mention
of the commons: An authority &s;o full, certain and ex|plicite,
that nothing but the zeal of party could ever
have procured credit to any contrary &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>IT was probably the example of the French barons
which fir&s;t emboldened the Engli&s;h to require greater in|dependance
from their &s;overeign: It is al&s;o probable, that
the boroughs and corporations of England were e&s;tabli&s;hed
in imitation of tho&s;e of France. It may, there|fore,
be propo&s;ed, as no unlikely conjecture, that both
the privileges of the peers and the liberty of the com|mons
were originally the growth of that country.</P>
<P>IN antient times, men were very little &s;olicitous to
obtain a place in the legi&s;lative a&s;&s;emblies; and rather
regarded their attendance as a burden, which was not
compen&s;tated by any return of profit or honour, propor|tioned
to the trouble and expence. The only rea&s;on of
in&s;tituting tho&s;e public councils, was; on the part of
the &s;ubject, that they de&s;ored &s;ome &s;ecurity from the at|tempts
of arbitrary power; and on the part of the &s;overegin,
<PB N="122" REF="137">
that he de&s;paired of governing men of &s;uch in|dependant
&s;pirits without their own con&s;ent and concur|rence.
But the commons, or the inhabitants of boroughs,
had not as yet reached &s;uch a degree of con&s;ideration, as
to de&s;ire <HI>&s;ecurity</HI> again&s;t their prince, or to imagine, that,
even if they were a&s;&s;embled in a repre&s;entative body, they
$ad power or rank &s;ufficient to enforce it. The only
protection, which they a&s;pired to, was again&s;t the imme|diate
violence and inju&s;tice of their fellow-citizens; and
this advantage each of them looked for, from the courts
of ju&s;tice, or from the authority of &s;ome great lord, to
whom, by law or his own choice, he was attached. On
the other hand, the &s;overeign was &s;ufficiently a&s;&s;ured of
obedience in the whole community, if he procured the
concurrence of the nobles; nor had he rea&s;on to appre|hend,
that any order of the &s;tate could re&s;i&s;t his and their
united authority. The military &s;ub-va&s;&s;als could enter|tain
no idea of oppo&s;ing both their prince and their &s;u|periors:
The burge&s;&s;es and trade&s;men could much le&s;s
a&s;pire to &s;uch a thought: And thus, even if hi&s;tory were
&s;ilent on that head, we have rea&s;on to conclude, from
the known &s;ituation of mankind during the&s;e ages, that
the commons were never admitted as members of the le|gi&s;lative body.</P>
<P>THE <HI>executive</HI> power of the Anglo-Norman govern|ment
was lodged in the King; and be&s;ides the &s;tated
meetings of the national council at the three great fe&s;tivals
of Chri&s;tmas, Ea&s;ter, and Whit&s;untide<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Dugd. Orig. Jurid. p. 15. Spel. Glo&s;&s;. in verbo <HI>parliamentum.</HI></NOTE>, he was
accu&s;tomed, on any &s;udden exigence, to &s;ummon them
together. He could at his plea&s;ure command the at|tendance
of his barons and their va&s;&s;als, in which con|&s;i&s;ted
the military force of the kingdom; and could em|ploy
them, during forty days, either in re&s;i&s;ting a foreign
<PB N="123" REF="138">
enemy, or reducing his rebellious &s;ubjects.
And what was of great importance, the whole <HI>judicial</HI> power was
ultimately in his hands, and was exerci&s;ed by officers and
mini&s;ters of his appointment.</P>
<P>THE general plan of the Anglo-Norman government
was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">judicial Power.</NOTE> that the court of barony was appointed to decide
&s;uch controver&s;ies as aro&s;e between the &s;everal va&s;&s;als
or &s;ubjects of the &s;ame barony; the hundred-court

&s;ubjects of different baronies<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">None of the feudal governments in Europe had &s;uch in&s;titutions as the county courts, which the great authority of the Conqueror &s;till retained from the Saxon cu&s;toms.

By this means, they received frequent and &s;en&s;ible admonitions of their depen|dance on the King or &s;upreme magi&s;trate: They formed a kind of com|munity with their fellow barons and freeholders: They were often drawn from their individual and independant &s;tate, peculiar to the feu|dal &s;y&s;tem; and were made members of a political body: And per|haps, this in&s;titution of county-courts in England has had greater effects on the government, than has yet been di&s;tinctly pointed out by hi&s;|torians or traced by antiquaries.

judicial trials took &s;oon after the Conque&s;t, &s;erved &s;till
more to encrea&s;e its authority, and to augment the royal
prerogatives. William, among the other violent changes,
which he attempted and effected, had introduced the
Norman law into England<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Dial. de Scac. p. 30, apud Madox, Hi&s;t. of the Exchequer.</NOTE>, had ordered all pleadings
<PB N="125" REF="140">
to be in that tongue, and had interwoven with the Eng|li&s;h
juri&s;prudence, all the maxims and principles, which
the Normans, more advanced in cultivation, and natu|rally
litigious, were accu&s;tomed to ob&s;erve in the di&s;tri|bution
of ju&s;tice. Law now became a &s;cience, which at
fir&s;t fell entirely into the hands of the Normans; and
which, even after it was communicated to the Engli&s;h,
required &s;o much &s;tudy and application, that the laity, in
tho&s;e ignorant ages, were incapable of attaining it, and
it was a my&s;tery almo&s;t &s;olely confined to the clergy, and
chiefly to the monks<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Malme&s;. lib. 4. p. 123.</NOTE>. The great officers of the
crown and the feudal barons, who were military men,
found them&s;elves unfit to penetrate into tho&s;e ob&s;curities;
and tho' they were intitled to a &s;eat in the &s;upreme judica|ture,
the bu&s;ine&s;s of the court was wholly managed by
the chief ju&s;ticiary and the law barons, who were men
appointed by the King, and entirely at his di&s;po&s;al<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Dugd. Orig. Jurid. p. 25.</NOTE>. This
natural cour&s;e of things was forwarded by the multipli|city
of bu&s;ine&s;s, which flowed into that court, and

But the great power of the Conqueror e&s;tabli&s;hed at first
in England an authority, which the monarchs in France
were not able to attain till the reign of St. Lewis, who
lived near two centuries after: He empowered his court
to receive appeals both from the courts of barony and the
county-courts, and by that means brought the admini&s;|tration
of ju&s;tice ultimately into the hands of the &s;ove|reign<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Madox. Hi&s;t. of the Exch. p. 65. Glanv. lib. 12. cap. 1. 7. LL. Hen. 1. &sect; 3$. apud Wilkins, p. 248. Fitz-Stephens, p. 36. Coke's Comment. on the &s;tatute of Marlbridge, cap. 20.</NOTE>.

What made the Anglo-Norman barons more readily &s;ubmit to appeals from their court to the King's court of Exchequer, was their being accu&s;tomed to like appeals in Normandy to the ducal court of exchequer. See Gilbert's Hi&s;tory of the exchequer, p. 1, 2.; tho' the author thinks it doubtful, whether the Norman court was not rather copied from the Engli&s;h, p. 6.</NOTE>. By this expedient, the
courts of barony were kept in awe, and if they &s;till pre|&s;erved
&s;ome influence, it was only from the apprehen&s;i|ons
which the va&s;&s;als might entertain of di&s;obliging their
&s;uperior, by appealing from his court. But the county|courts
were much di&s;credited; and as the freeholders
were found ignorant of the intricate principles and forms
of the new law, the lawyers gradually brought all bu|&s;ine&s;s
before the King's judges, and abandoned the an|tient
&s;imple and popular judicature. After this manner,
the formalities of ju&s;tice, which, tho' they appear tedi|ous
and cumber&s;ome, are found requi&s;ite to the &s;upport
of liberty in all monarchical governments, proved at fir&s;t,
by a combination of cau&s;es, very advantageous to the
royal authority in England.</P>
<P>THE power of the Norman kings was al&s;o much &s;upported
by a great revenue;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Revenue of the crown.</NOTE> and by a revenue, that was
fixed, perpetual, and independant of the &s;ubject. The
people, without betaking them&s;elves to arms, had no
check upon the King, and no regular &s;ecurity for the due
di&s;tribution of ju&s;tice. In tho&s;e days of violence, ma|ny
in&s;tances of oppre&s;&s;ion pa&s;&s;ed unheeded; and were
&s;oon after openly pleaded as precedents, which it was
<PB N="127" REF="142">
unlawful to di&s;pute or controul. Princes and mini&s;ters
were too ignorant to be them&s;elves &s;en&s;ible of the advan|tages
attending an equitable admini&s;tration; and there
was no e&s;tabli&s;hed council or a&s;&s;embly which could
protect the people, and, by withdrawing &s;upplies, regu|larly
and peaceably admoni&s;h the King of his duty, and
en&s;ure the execution of the laws.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t, branch of the King's &s;tated revenue was the
royal deme&s;nes or crown-lands, which were very exten|&s;ive,
and comprehended, be&s;ide a great number of ma|nors,
mo&s;t of the chief cities of the kingdom. It was
e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, that the King could alienate no part
of his deme&s;ne, and that he him&s;elf, or his &s;ucce&s;&s;or,
could, at any time, re&s;ume &s;uch donations<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Fleta, lib. 1. cap. 8, 17. lib. 3. cap. 6. &sect; 3. Bracton, lib. 2. cap. 5.</NOTE>: But this
law was never regularly ob&s;erved; which happily ren|dered
in time the crown &s;omewhat more dependant. The
rent of the crown-lands, con&s;idered merely as &s;o much
riches, was a &s;ource of power: The influence of the
King over his tenants and the inhabitants of his towns,
increa&s;ed this power: But the other numerous branches
of his revenue, be&s;ides &s;upplying his trea&s;ury, gave, by
their very nature, a great latitude to arbitrary autho|rity,
and were a &s;upport of the prerogative; as will
appear from an enumeration of them.</P>
<P>THE King was never content with the &s;tated rents,
but levied heavy tailliages at plea&s;ure on the inhabitants
both of town and country, who lived within his de|me&s;ne.
All bargains of &s;ale, in order to prevent theft,
being prohibited, except in boroughs and public markets<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">LL. Will. 1. cap. 61.</NOTE>,
he pretended to exact tolls on all goods which were
there &s;old<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Madox, p. 530.</NOTE>. He &s;eized two hog&s;heads, one before and
one behind the ma&s;t, from every ve&s;&s;el that imported
<PB N="128" REF="143">
wine. All goods paid to his cu&s;toms a proportional part
of their value<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Madox, p. 529. This author &s;ays a fifteenth. But it is not ea&s;y to reconcile this account to other authorities.</NOTE>: Pa&s;&s;age over bridges and on rivers was
loaded with tolls at plea&s;ure<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Madox, p. 529.</NOTE>: And tho' the boroughs
by degrees bought the liberty of farming the&s;e impo|&s;itions,
yet the revenue profited by the&s;e bargains, new
&s;ums were often exacted for the renewal and confirma|tion
of the privileges<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Madox's Hi&s;t. of the Exch. p. 275, 276, 277, &amp;c.</NOTE>, and the people were thus held
in perpetual dependance.</P>
<P>SUCH was the &s;ituation of the inhabitants within the
royal deme&s;nes. But the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of land, or the mi|litary
tenants, tho' they were better protected, both
by law, and by the great privilege of carrying arms,
were, from the nature of their tenures, much expo&s;ed
to the inroads of power, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not what we &s;hould
e&s;teem in our age a very durable &s;ecurity. The Con|queror
granted by his laws, that the barons &s;hould be
obliged to pay nothing beyond their &s;tated &s;ervices<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">LL. Will. Conq. &sect; 55.</NOTE>,
except a rea&s;onable aid to ran&s;om his per&s;on if he were
taken in war, to make his elde&s;t &s;on a knight, and to
marry his elde&s;t daughter. What &s;hould, on the&s;e oc|ca&s;ions,
be deemed a rea&s;onable aid, was not deter|mined;
and the demands of the crown were &s;o far di&s;|cretionary.</P>
<P>THE King could require in war the per&s;onal attend|ance
of his va&s;&s;als, that is, of all the landed proprie|tors;
and if they declined the &s;ervice, they were obliged
to pay him a compo&s;ition in money, which was called
a &s;cutage. The &s;um was, during &s;ome reigns, very
precarious and uncertain; it was &s;ometimes levied with|out
<PB N="129" REF="144">
out allowing the va&s;&s;al the liberty of per&s;onal &s;ervice<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Gerva&s;e de Tilbury, p. 25.</NOTE>
and it was an u&s;ual artifice of the King to pretend an
expedition,; that he might be intitled to levy the &s;cutage
from his military tenants. Danegelt was another &s;pecies
of land-tax levied by the early Norman kings, arbitra|rily,
and contrary to the laws of the Conqueror<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Madox's Hi&s;t. of the Exch. p. 475.</NOTE>. Mo|neyage
was al&s;o a general land-tax of the &s;ame nature,
levied by the two fir&s;t Norman kings, and aboli&s;hed by
the charter of Henry I.<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Matth. Paris, p. 38.</NOTE> It was a &s;hilling paid every
three years by each hearth, to induce the King not to
u&s;e his prerogative of deba&s;ing the coin. Indeed, it ap|pears
from that charter, that, tho' the Conqueror had
granted his military tenants an immunity from all taxes
and tailliages, he and his &s;on William had never thought
them&s;elves bound to ob&s;erve that rule, but had levied im|po&s;itions
at plea&s;ure on all the landed e&s;tates of the king|dom.
The utmo&s;t that Henry grants, is, that the land
cultivated by the military tenant him&s;elf &s;hall not be &s;o
burdened; but he re&s;erves the power of taxing the far|mers:
And as it is known, that Henry's charter was
never ob&s;erved in any one article, we may be a&s;&s;ured,
that this prince and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors retracted even this
&s;mall indulgence, and levied arbitrary impo&s;itions on all
the lands of all their &s;ubjects. The&s;e taxes were &s;ome|times
very heavy; &s;ince Malme&s;bury tells us, that, in
the reign of William Ru&s;us, the farmers, on account of
them, abanedond tillage, and a famine ea&s;ued<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">So al&s;o Chron. Abb. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 55. Knyghton, p. 2366.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE e&s;cheats were a great branch both of power and
of revenue to the King, e&s;pecially during the fir&s;t reigns
after the conque&s;t. In default of de&s;cendants from the
fir&s;t baron, his land reverted to the crown, and conti|nually
augmented the King's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, The prince
<PB N="130" REF="145">
had indeed by law a power of alienating the&s;e e&s;cheats;
but by this means he enjoyed an opportunity of e&s;tabli&s;h|ing
the fortunes of his friends and &s;ervants, and thereby
enlarging his authority. Sometimes he retained them in
his own hands, and they were gradually confounded with
his royal deme&s;nes, and became difficult to be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
from them. This confu&s;ion is probably the rea|son
why the King acquired the right of alienating his
deme&s;nes.</P>
<P>BUT be&s;ides e&s;cheats from default of heirs, tho&s;e which
en&s;ued from crimes or breach of duty towards the &s;upe|rior
lord, were very frequent in antient times. If the
va&s;&s;al, being thrice &s;ummoned to attend his &s;uperior's
court, and do fealty, neglected or refu&s;ed obedience, he
forfeited all title to his lands<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Hottom. de Feud. Di&s;p. cap. 38, col. 886.</NOTE>. If he denied his tenure,
or refu&s;ed his &s;ervice, he was expo&s;ed to the &s;ame pe|nalty<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Lib. Feud. Lib. 3. tit. 1.; lib. 4. tit. 21, 39.</NOTE>.
Where he &s;old his e&s;tate without licence from
his lord<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Lib. Feud. lib. 1. tit. 21.</NOTE>, or if he &s;old it upon any other tenure or title
than that by which he him&s;elf held it<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Lib. Feud, lib. 4. tit. 44.</NOTE>, he lo&s;t all right
to it. The adhering to his lord's enemies<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Id. lib. 3. tit. 1.</NOTE>, de&s;erting
him in war<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Id. lib. 4. tit. 14, 21.</NOTE>, betraying his &s;ecrets<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Id. lib 4. tit. 14.</NOTE>, debauching his
wife or his nearer relations<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Id. lib. 1. tit. 14, 21.</NOTE>, or even u&s;ing indecent li|berties
with them<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Id. Lib. 1. tit. 1.</NOTE>, might be puni&s;hed by forfeiture.
The higher crimes, rapes, robbery, murder, burning
hou&s;es, &amp;c. were called felony; and being interpreted
want of fidelity to his lord, made him lo&s;e his fief<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Spelm. Glo&s;i. in verb. <HI>F$onia.</HI></NOTE>.
Even where the felon was va&s;&s;al to a baron, tho' his
immediate lord enjoyed the forfeiture, the King might
retain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his e&s;tate during a year, and had the
<PB N="131" REF="146">
right of &s;poiling and de&s;troying it, unle&s;s the baron paid
him a rea&s;onable compo&s;ition<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Spelm. Glo&s;&s;. in verb. <HI>Felonia.</HI> Glanville, lib, 7. cap. 17.</NOTE>. We have not here enu|merated
all the &s;pecies of felonies, or of crimes by which
forfeiture was incurred: We have Paid enough to prove,
that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of feudal property was antiently &s;ome|what
precarious, and that the primary idea was never
entirely lo&s;t, of its being a kind of <HI>fee or benefice.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN a baron died, the King immediately took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the e&s;tate; and the heir, before he recovered his
right, was obliged to make application to the crown, to
de&s;ire that he might be admitted to do homage for his
land, and to pay a compo&s;ition to the King. This com|po&s;ition
was not at fir&s;t fixed by l$w, at lea&s;t by prac|tice:
The King was often very exorbitant in his de|mands,
and kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the land till they were com|plied
with.</P>
<P>IF the heir was a minor, the King retained the whole
profit of the e&s;tate till his majority; and might grant
what &s;um he thought proper for the education and main|tenance
of the young baron. This practice was al&s;o
founded on the notion, that a fief was a benefice, and
that, while the heir could not perform his military &s;er|vices,
the revenue devolved to the &s;uperior, who em|ployed
another in his place. It is obvious, that a great
proportion of the landed property mu&s;t, by means of
this device, be continually in the hands of the prince,
and that all the noble families were thereby held in con|tinual
dependance. When the King granted the ward|&s;hip
of a rich heir to any one, he had the opportunity of
enriching a favourite or mini&s;ter: If he fold it, he was
thereby able to levy a con&s;iderable &s;um of money. Simon
de Mountfort paid Henry III. 10,000 marks, an im|men&s;e
<PB N="132" REF="147">
&s;um in tho&s;e days, for the wardship of Gilbert de Umfreville<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Madox's Hi&s;t. of the Exch. p. 223.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IF the heir was a female, the King was entitled to of|fer
her any hu&s;band of her rank he thought proper; and
if &s;he refu&s;ed him, &s;he forfeited her land. Even a male
heir could not marry without the royal con&s;ent, and it
was u&s;ual for men to pay large &s;ums for the liberty of
making their own choice in marriage<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 320.</NOTE>. No man could
di&s;po&s;e of his land, either by &s;ale or will, Without the
con&s;ent of his &s;uperior. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or was never con|&s;idered
as full proprietor: He was &s;till a kind of bene|ficiary;
and could not oblige his &s;uperior to accept of
any va&s;&s;al, who was not agreeable to him.</P>
<P>FINES, amerciaments, and oblatas, as they were cal|led,
were another con&s;iderable branch of the royal power
and revenue. The antient records of the exchequer,
which are &s;till pre&s;erved, give furprizing accounts of the
numerous fines and amerciaments levied in tho&s;e days<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 272.</NOTE>,
and of the &s;trange inventions fallen upon to exact mo|ney
from the &s;ubject. It appears, that the old kings of
England put them&s;elves entirely on the footing of the
barbarous ea&s;tern princes, whom no man mu&s;t approach
without a pre&s;ent, who fell all their good offices, and
who intrude them&s;elves into every bu&s;ine&s;s, that they
may have a pretence of extorting money. Even ju&s;tice
was avowedly bought and fold; the King's court it&s;elf,
tho' the &s;upreme judicature of the kingdom, was open
to none that brought not large pre&s;ents to the King;

reign of Henry II. the be&s;t and mo&s;t ju&s;t of the&s;e prin|ces,
the elde&s;t &s;on and the widow of this nobleman came
<PB N="137" REF="152">
to court, and &s;trove, by proffering large pre&s;ents to the
King, each of them to acquire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that rich in|heritance.
The King was &s;o equitable as to order the
cau&s;e to be tried by the great council! but in the mean
time, he &s;eized into his own hands all the money and
trea&s;ures of the decea&s;ed<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 180, 181.</NOTE>. Peter of Blois, a judicious, and even an elegant writer for that age, gives a pathetic
de&s;cription of the venality of ju&s;tice and the oppre&s;&s;ions
of the poor, under the reign of Henry: and he &s;cruples
not to complain to the king him&s;elf of the&s;e abu&s;es<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Petri Ble&s;. Epi&s;t. 95. apud Bibl. Patrum, tom. 24. p. 2014.</NOTE>.
We may judge what the ca&s;e would be under the govern|ment
of wor&s;e princes. The articles of enquiry concern|ing
the conduct of &s;heriffs, which Henry promulgated in
1170, &s;how the great power as well as the licentiou&s;ne&s;s
of the&s;e officers<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Hoveden Chron. Gerv. p. 1410.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AMERCIAMENTS or fines for crimes and tre&s;pa&s;&s;es were
another con&s;iderable branch of the royal revenue<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Madox, chap. xiv.</NOTE>. Mo&s;t
crimes were atoned for by money; the fines impo&s;ed were
not limited by any rule or &s;tatute; and frequently occa|&s;ioned
the total ruin of the per&s;on, even for the &s;lighte&s;t
tre&s;pa&s;&s;es. The fore&s;t-laws, particularly, were a great
&s;ource of oppre&s;&s;ion. The king po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ixty-eight &s;o|re&s;ts,
thirteen chaces, and &s;even hundred and eighty-one
parks, in different parts of England<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Spelm, Glo&s;&s;. in verbo <HI>Fore&s;ta.</HI></NOTE>; and con&s;idering
the extreme pa&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h and Normans for hunt|ing,
the&s;e were &s;o many &s;nares laid for the people, by
which they were allured into tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, and brought with|in
the reach of arbitrary and rigorous laws, which the
king had thought proper by his own authority to enact.</P>
<P>BUT the mo&s;t barefaced acts of tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion
were tho&s;e praci&s;ed again&s;t the Jews, who were entirely

out of the protection of law, were extremely odious
to the bigotry of the people, and were abandoned to the
immea&s;urable rapacity of the King and his mini&s;ters. Be|&s;ides
many other indignities, to which they were conti|nually
expo&s;ed, it appears, that they were once all
thrown into pri&s;on, and the &s;um of 66,000 marks exact|ed
for their liberty<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Madox Hi&s;t. of the Exch. p. 151. This happened in the reign of King John.</NOTE>: At another time, I&s;aac the Jew

<P>WE may judge of the low &s;tate of commerce among the
Engli&s;h,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Commerce.</NOTE> when the Jews, notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e op|pre&s;&s;ions,
could &s;till find their account in trading among
them, and lending them money. And as the improve|ments
of agriculture were al&s;o much checked, both by
the immen&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the nobility, and by the preca|rious
&s;tate of feudal property; it appears, that indu&s;try
of no kind could then have place in the kingdom<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">We learn from the extracts given us of Dome&s;day by Brady in his Treati&s;e of Boroughs, that almo&s;t all the boroughs of England had &s;uffered in the &s;hock of the Conque&s;t, and had decayed extremely between the death of the Con&s;e&s;&s;or, and the time when Dome&s;day was framed.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is a&s;&s;erted by Sir Harry Spellman<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Glo&s;&s;. in verb <HI>judicium Dei.</HI></NOTE>, as an undoubted
truth, that, during the reigns of the fir&s;t Norman prin|ces,
<PB N="139" REF="154">
every edict of the king, I&s;&s;ued with the con&s;ent of
his privy-council, had the full force of law. But the ba|rons
&s;urely were not &s;o pa&s;&s;ive as to entru&s;t a power, en|tirely
arbitrary and de&s;potic, into the hands of the &s;ove|reign.
It only appears, that the con&s;titution had not
fixed any preci&s;e boundaries to the royal power; that the
right of i&s;&s;uing proclamations on any emergence and of
exacting obedience to them, a right which was always
&s;uppo&s;ed inherent in the crown, is very difficult to be
di&s;tingui&s;hed from a legi&s;lative authority; that the extreme
imperfection of the antient laws, and the &s;udden exigen|tcies,
which often occurred in &s;uch turbulent govern|ments,
obliged the prince to exert frequently the latent
powers of his prerogative; that he naturally proceeded,
from the acquie&s;cence of the people, to a&s;&s;ume, in many
particulars of moment, an authority, from which he had
excluded him&s;elf by expre&s;s &s;tatutes, charters or conce&s;|&s;ions,
and which was, in the main, repugnant to the ge|neral
genius of the con&s;titution; and that the lives, the
per&s;onal liberty, and the properties of all his &s;ubjects were
le&s;s &s;ecured by law again&s;t the exertion of his arbitrary
authority, than by the independant power and private
connexions of each individual. It appears from the
great charter it&s;elf, that not only John, a tyrannical
prince, and Richard, a violent one, but their father,
Henry, under who&s;e reign the prevalence of gro&s;s abu&s;es
is the lea&s;t to be &s;u&s;pected, was accu&s;tomed, from his &s;ole
authority, without proce&s;s of law, to impri&s;on, bani&s;h
and attaint the freemen of his kingdom.</P>
<P>A GREAT baron, in antient times, con&s;idered him&s;elf
as a kind of &s;overeign within his territory; and was at|tended
with courtiers and dependants more zealou&s;ly at|tached
to him than the mini&s;ters of &s;tate and the great of|ficers
were commonly to <HI>their</HI> fovereign. He often main|tained
<PB N="140" REF="155">
in his court the parade of royalty, by e&s;tabli&s;hing
a ju&s;ticiary, con&s;table, mare&s;chal, chamberlain, &s;ene&s;chal,
and chancellor, and a&s;&s;igning to each of the&s;e officers a
&s;eparate province and command. He was u&s;ually very
a&s;&s;iduous in exerci&s;ing his juri&s;diction; and took &s;uch de|light
in that image of &s;overeignty, that it was found ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to re&s;train his activity, and prohibit him by law
from holding courts too frequently<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Dugd. Jurid. Orig. p. 26.</NOTE>. It is not to be
doubted, that the example, &s;et him by the prince, of a
mercenary and &s;ordid extortion, would be faithfully co|pied;
and that all his good and bad offices, his ju&s;tice
and inju&s;tice, were equally put to &s;ale. He had the
power, with the king's con&s;ent, to exact talliages even
from the free-citizens who lived within his barony; and
as his nece&s;&s;ities made him rapacious, his authority was
u&s;ually found to be more oppre&s;&s;ive and tyrannical than
that of the &s;overeign<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Madox. Hi&s;t. of
Exch. p. 520.</NOTE>. He was ever engaged in heredi|tary
or per&s;onal animo&s;ities or confederacies with his
neighbours, and often gave protection to all de&s;perate ad|venturers
and criminals, who could be u&s;eful in &s;erving
his violent purpo&s;es. He was able alone, in times of
tranquillity, to ob&s;truct the execution of ju&s;tice within
his territories; and by combining with a few malcontent
barons of high rank and power, he could throw the
whole &s;tate into convul&s;ions. And on the whole, tho'
the royal authority was confined within bounds, and of|ten
within very narrow ones, yet the check was irregu|lar,
and often the &s;ource of great di&s;orders; and it was
not derived from the liberty of the people, but from the
military power of many petty tyrants, who were equally
dangerous to the prince and oppre&s;&s;ive to the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>THE power of the church was another rampart again&s;t
royal authority;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Church.</NOTE> but this defence was al&s;o the cau&s;e of
many mi&s;chiefs and inconveniencies. The dignified
<PB N="141" REF="156">
clergy, perhaps, were not &s;o prone to immediate vio|lence
as the barons; but as they pretended to a total in|dependance
on the &s;tate, and could always cover them|&s;elves
with the appearances of religion, they proved, in
one re&s;pect, an ob&s;truction to the &s;ettlement of the king|dom,
and to the regular execution of the laws. The
policy of the conqueror was in this particular liable to
&s;ome exception. He augmented the &s;uper&s;titious vene|ration
for Rome, to which that age was &s;o much in|clined;
and he broke tho&s;e bands of connexion, which,
in the Saxon times, had pre&s;erved an union between the
lay and the clerical orders. He prohibited the bi&s;hops to
&s;it in the county-courts; he allowed eccle&s;ia&s;tical cau&s;es
to be tried only in &s;piritual courts<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Char. Will, apud Wilkins, p. 230. Spel. Conc. vol. ii, p. 14.</NOTE>; and he &s;o much
exalted the power of the clergy, that of 60,215 knights
fees, into which he divided England, he placed no le&s;s
than 28,015 under the, church<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Spel. Glo&s;&s;. in verb. <HI>manus mortua.</HI> We are not to imagine, as &s;ome have done, that the church po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed lands in this proportion, but only that they and their va&s;&s;als enjoyed &s;uch a proportionable part of the landed property.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE right of primogeniture came in with the feudal
law:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Civil laws.</NOTE> A practice, which is hurtful by producing and
maintaining an unequal divi&s;ion of private property; but
is advantageous, in another re&s;pect, by accu&s;toming the
people to a preference in favour of the elde&s;t &s;on, and
thereby preventing a partition or di&s;puted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in
the monarchy. The Normans introduced the u&s;e of &s;ir|names,
which tend to pre&s;erve the knowledge of families
and pedigrees; as do al&s;o, the di&s;tinction of coats of
arms, which came in vogue about the time of king Ri|chard.
They aboli&s;hed none of the old ab&s;urd methods
of trial, by the cro&s;s or ordeal; and they added a new
I ab&s;urdity, that by &s;ingle combat<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">LL. Will. cap. 68.</NOTE>, which became a
<PB N="142" REF="157">
regular part of juri&s;prudence, and was conducted with all

The ideas of chivalry al&s;o &s;eem to have been imported by
the Normans: No traces of the&s;e fanta&s;tic notions are
to be found among the plain and ru&s;tic Saxons: The
feudal in&s;titutions, by rai&s;ing a &s;et of men to a kind of
&s;overeign dignity, rendering per&s;onal &s;trength and valor
&s;o requi&s;ite, and making every knight and baron his own
protector and avenger, begot that military pride and
&s;en&s;e of honour, which, being cultivated and embelli&s;h|ed
by the poets and romance writers of the age, ended
in chivalry. The virtuous knight fought not only in his
own quarrel; but in that of the innocent, the helple&s;s,
and above all, of the fair, whom he &s;uppo&s;ed to be for
ever under the guardian&s;hip of his valiant arm. The un|courteous
knight, who, from his ca&s;tle, exerci&s;ed rob|bery
on travellers, and committed violence on virgins,
was the object of his perpetual indignation; and he put
him to death, without &s;cruple or trial or appeal, where|ever
he met with him. The great independance of men
made per&s;onal honour and fidelity the chief tie among
them; and rendered it the capital virtue of every true
knight, or genuine profe&s;&s;or of chivalry. The &s;olemni|ties
of &s;ingle combat, as e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, bani&s;hed the
notion of every thing unfair or unequal in rencounters;
and maintained an appearance of courte&s;y between the
combatants, till the moment of their engagement. The
credulity of the age gra&s;ted on this &s;tock the notion of
giants, enchanters, dragons, &s;pells<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">In all legal &s;ingle combats, it was part of the champion's oath, that he carried not about him any herb, &s;pell, or inchantment, by which he might procure victory. Dugd. Orig. Jurid. p. 82.</NOTE>, and a thou&s;and won|der
<PB N="143" REF="158">
which &s;till multiplied during the times of the Cru|&s;ades;
when men, returning from &s;o great a di&s;tance, u&s;ed
the liberty of impo&s;ing every fiction on their believing
audience. The&s;e ideas of chivalry infected the writings,
conver&s;ation, and behaviour of men, during &s;ome ages;
and even after they were, in a great degree, bani&s;hed
by the revival of learning, they left modern <HI>gallantry</HI>
and the <HI>point of honour,</HI> which &s;till maintain their in|fluence,
and are the genuine offspring of tho&s;e ancient affectations.</P>
<P>THE conce&s;&s;ion of the great charter, or rather its full
e&s;tabli&s;hment (for there was a con&s;iderable interval be|tween
the one and the other) gave ri&s;e, by degrees, to
a new &s;pecies of government, and introduced &s;ome order
and ju&s;tice into the admini&s;tration. The en&s;uing &s;cenes
of our hi&s;tory are therefore &s;omewhat different from the
preceding. Yet the great charter contained no e&s;tabli&s;h|ment
of new courts, magi&s;trates, or &s;enates, nor aboli|tion
of the old. It introduced no new di&s;tribution of
the powers of the commonwealth, and no innovation in
the political or public law of the kingdom. It only
guarded, and that merely by verbal clau&s;es, again&s;t &s;uch
tyrannical practices as are incompatible with civilized
government, and, if they become very frequent, are in|compatible
with all government. The barbarous licence
of the kings, and perhaps of the nobles, was thenceforth
&s;omewhat more re&s;trained: Men acquired &s;ome more
&s;ecurity for their properties and their liberties: And go|vernment
approached a little nearer to that end, for
which it was originally in&s;tituted, the di&s;tribution of ju|&s;tice,
and the equal protection of the citizens. Acts of
violence and iniquity in the crown, which before were
only deemed injuries to individuals, and were hazardous
chiefly in proportion to the number, power, and dignity
of the per&s;ons affected by them, were now regarded, in
<PB N="144" REF="159">
&s;ome degree, as public injuries, and as infringements of
a charter, calculated for general &s;ecurity. And thus, the
e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Great Charter, without &s;eeming any|wife
to innovate in the di&s;tribution of political power, be|came
a kind of epoch in the con&s;$itution.</P>

during the time, or to the per&s;ons engaged in the tran&s;|actions.
This truth is no where more evident than with
regard to the reign, upon which we are going to enter.
<PB N="146" REF="161">
What mortal could have the patience to write or read a
long detail of &s;uch frivolous events as tho&s;e with which
it is filled, or attend to a tedious narrative which would
follow, thro' a &s;eries of fifty &s;ix years, the caprices and
weakne&s;&s;es of &s;o mean a prince as Henry? The chief
rea&s;on, why prote&s;tant writers have been &s;o anxious to
&s;pread out the incidents of this reign, is in order to ex|po&s;e
the rapacity, ambition, and artifices of the court of
Rome, and to prove, that the great dignitaries of the
catholic church, while they pretended to have nothing
in view but the &s;alvation of &s;ouls, had bent all their at|tention
to the acqui&s;ition of riches, and were re&s;trained
by no &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice or honour, in the pur&s;uit of that
great object<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 623.</NOTE>. But this conclu&s;ion would readily be
allowed them, tho' it were not illu&s;trated by &s;uch a de|tail
of unintere&s;ting incidents; and follows indeed, by an
evident nece&s;&s;ity, from the very &s;ituation, in which that
church was placed with regard to the re&s;t of Europe.
For be&s;ides that all eccle&s;ia&s;tical power, as it can always
cover its operations under a cloak of &s;anctity, and at|tacks
men on the &s;ide where they dare not employ their
rea&s;on, lies le&s;s under controul than civil government;
be&s;ides this general cau&s;e, I &s;ay, the Pope and his cour|tiers
were foreigners to mo&s;t of the churches which they governed; they
could not po&s;&s;ibly have any other object
but to pillage the provinces for pre&s;ent gain; and as
they lived at a di&s;tance, they would be little awed by
&s;hame or remor&s;e, in practi&s;ing every lucrative expedient,
which was &s;ugge&s;ted to them. England being one of the
mo&s;t remote provinces, attached to the Romi&s;h hierarchy,
as well as one of the riche&s;t, and the mo&s;t prone to &s;upper|&s;tition,

every $n&s;action tran&s;mitted to us; and till the
end of the reign, when the events become more memo|rable,
we &s;hall not always ob&s;erve an exact chronolo|gical
order in our narration.</P>
<P>THE earl of Pembroke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Settlement of the go|vernment.</NOTE> who,<NOTE PLACE="marg">28th Oct.</NOTE> at the time of John's
death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">11th Nov.</NOTE> was mari&s;chal of England, was by his office at
the head of the armies, and con&s;equently, during a &s;tate
of civil wars and convul&s;ions, at the head of the &s;tate;
and it happened fortunately for the young monarch,
and for the nation, that the power could not have been
intru&s;ted into more able and more faithful hands. This
nobleman, who had maintained his loyalty un&s;haken to
John during the lowe&s;t fortune of that monarch, deter|mined
to &s;upport the authority of the infant prince; and
he was not di&s;mayed with the number and violence of
his enemies. Sen&s;ible, that Henry, according to the
prejudices of the times, would not be deemed &s;overeign,
till crowned and anointed by a churchman; he immedi|ately
carried the young prince to Gloce&s;ter, where the ce|remony
of coronation was performed, in the pre&s;ence of
Gualo, the legate, and a very few noblemen, by the bi|&s;hops
of Winche&s;ter and Bath<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 200. Hi&s;t. Croy&s;. Cont. p. 474. W. Heming. p. 562. Trivet, p. 168.</NOTE>. As the concurrence
of the papal authority was requi&s;ite to &s;upport the tot|tering
throne, Henry was obliged to &s;wear fealty to the
Pope, and renew that homage, to which his father had
already &s;ubjected the kingdom<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 200.</NOTE>: And in order to en|large
the authority of Pembroke, and give him a more
regular and legal title to it, a general council of the
barons was &s;oon after &s;ummoned at Bri&s;tol, where that
nobleman was cho&s;en protector of the kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="163">
PEMBROKE, that he might reconcile all men to the
government of his pupil, made him grant anew a charter
of liberties, which, tho' mo&s;tly copied from the former
conce&s;&s;ions, extorted from John, contains &s;ome altera|tions,
which may be deemed remarkable<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 1. p. 215.</NOTE>. The full pri|vilege
of elections in the clergy, granted by John the
former King, was not confirmed, nor the liberty of go|ing
out of the kingdom, without the royal con&s;ent:
Whence we may conjecture, that Pembroke and the
barons, jealous of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical power, were de&s;irous
of renewing the King's claim to i&s;&s;ue a cong$egrave; d'elire to
the monks and chapters, and thought it requi&s;ite to put
&s;ome check on the frequent appeals to Rome. But what
may chiefly &s;urprize us is, that the obligation, to which
John had &s;ubjected him&s;elf, of obtaining the con&s;ent of
the great council before he levied any aids or &s;cutages
from the nation, was omitted; and this article was even
declared hard and &s;evere, and was expre&s;sly left to future
deliberation. But we mu&s;t con&s;ider, that, tho' this li|mitation
may perhaps appear to us the mo&s;t momentous
in the whole charter of John, it was not regarded in that
light by the antient barons, who were more jealous of
particular acts of violence in the crown than of &s;uch ge|neral
impo&s;itions, which, unle&s;s they were evidently
rea&s;onable and nece&s;&s;ary, could &s;carce, without a gene|ral
con&s;ent, be levied upon men, who had arms in their
hands, and who could repel any act of oppre&s;&s;ion, by
which they were all immediately affected. We accord|ingly
find, that Henry, in the cour&s;e of his reign, while
he gave frequent occa&s;ions for complaint, with regard to
the violations of the great charter, never once attempt|ed,
by his mere will, to levy any aids or &s;cutages;
though he was often reduced to great nece&s;&s;ities, and
<PB N="149" REF="164">
was refu&s;ed &s;upplies by his people. So much ea&s;ier was
it for him to tran&s;gre&s;s the law, when individuals alone
were affected, than even to exert his acknowledged pre|rogatives,
where the intere&s;t of the whole body was
concerned.</P>
<P>THIS charter was again confirmed by the King in the
en&s;uing year, with the addition of fome articles to pre|vent
the oppre&s;&s;ions of &s;heriffs: And al&s;o with an addi|tional
charter of fore&s;ts, a circum&s;tance of great moment
in tho&s;e ages, when hunting was &s;o much the occupation
of the nobility, and when the King comprehended &s;o
con&s;iderable a part of the kingdom within his fore&s;ts,
which he governed by peculiar and arbitrary laws. All
the fore&s;ts, which had been enclo&s;ed &s;ince the reign of
Henry the &s;econd, were de&s;afore&s;ted; and new peram|bulations
were appointed for that purpo&s;e: Offences in
the fore&s;ts were declared to be no longer capital; but
puni&s;hable by fines, impri&s;onrnents, and more gentle
penalties: And all the proprietors of land recovered the
power of cutting and tiling their own wood at their
plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Thus, the&s;e famous charters were brought very nearly
to the &s;hape, in which they have ever &s;ince &s;lood; and
they were, during many generations, the darling of the
whole Engli&s;h nation, and e&s;teemed the mo&s;t &s;acred
rampart to national liberty and independance. As they
&s;ecured the rights of all orders of men, they were re|garded
with a jealous eye by all, and became the ba&s;is,
in a manner, of the Engli&s;h monarchy, and a kind of
original contract, which both limited the authority of
the King, and en&s;ured the conditional allegiance of his
&s;ubjects. Tho' often violated, they were &s;till claimed
and recalled by the nobility and people; and as no pre|cedents
were &s;uppo&s;ed valid, that infringed them, they
rather acquired, than lo&s;t authority, from the frequent
<PB N="150" REF="165">
attempts, made again&s;t them in feveral ages, by regal
and arbitrary power.</P>
<P>WHILE Pembroke, by renewing and confirming the
great charter, gave &s;o much &s;atisfaction and &s;ecurity to
the nation in general, he al&s;o applied him&s;elf &s;ucce&s;sfully
to individuals; and wrote letters, in the King's name,
to all the malecontent barons; in which he re|pre&s;ented
to them, that whatever jealou&s;y and animo&s;ity
they might have entertained again&s;t the late King, a
young prince, the lineal heir of their antient monarchs,
had now &s;ucceeded to the throne, without &s;ucceeding
either to the re&s;entments or principles of his predece&s;&s;or:
That the de&s;perate expedient, which they had employed,
of calling in a foreign potentate, had, happily for them
as well as for the nation, failed of entire &s;ucce&s;s, and it
was &s;till in their power, by a quick return to their duty,
to re&s;tore the independence of the kingdom, and to &s;e|cure
that liberty, for which they &s;o zealou&s;ly contended:
That as all pa&s;t offences of the barons were now buried
in oblivion, they ought, on their part, to forget their
complaints again&s;t their late &s;overeign, who, if he had
been any wife blameable in his conduct, had left to his
&s;on the &s;alutary warning, to avoid the paths, which had
led to &s;uch fatal extremities: And that having now ob|tained
a charter for their liberties, it was their intere&s;t
to &s;hew, by their conduct, that that acqui&s;ition was not
incompatible with their allegiance, and that the rights of
King and people, &s;o far from being ho&s;tile and oppo&s;ite,
might mutually &s;upport and &s;u&s;tain each other<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. I. p. 215. Brady's App. No. 143.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE con&s;iderations, enforced by the character of
con&s;tancy and fidelity, which Pembroke had ever main|tained,
had a mighty influence on the barons; and the
mo&s;t of them began &s;ecretly to negotiate with him, and
many of them openly returned to their duty. The diffi|dence,
<PB N="151" REF="166">
which Lewis di&s;covered of their fidelity, for|warded
this general propen&s;ion towards the King; and
when the French prince refu&s;ed the government of the
ca&s;tle of Hertford to Robert Fitz-Walter, who had been
&s;o active again&s;t the late King, and who claimed that
fortre&s;s as his right and property, they all plainly &s;aw,
that the Engli&s;h were excluded from every tru&s;t, and
that foreigners had engro&s;&s;ed all the confidence and af|fection
of their new &s;overeign<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 200, 202.</NOTE>. The excommunication
too, denounced by the legate, again&s;t all Lewis's adhe|rents,
failed not, in the turn which mens di&s;po&s;itions
had taken, to operate a mighty effect upon them; and
they were ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to con&s;ider a cau&s;e as impious
and profane, for which they had already entertained an
un&s;urmountable aver&s;ion<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 200. M. We&s;t. p. 277.</NOTE>. Tho' Lewis made a journey
to France, and brought over fre&s;h &s;uccours from that
kingdom<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Chron. Dun&s;t. vol. 1: p. 79. M. We&s;t. p. 277.</NOTE>, he found, on his return, that his party was
&s;till more weakened by the de&s;ertion of his Engli&s;h con|federates,
and that the death of John, had, contrary to
his expectation, given an incurable blow to his cau&s;e.
The earls of Sali&s;bury, Arundel, and Warrenne, toge|ther
with William Mare&s;hal, elde&s;t &s;on of the protector,
had embraced Henry's party; and every Engli&s;h noble|man
was plainly watching an opportunity of returning
to his allegiance. Pembroke was &s;o much &s;trengthened
by the&s;e acce&s;&s;ions, that he ventured to inve&s;t Mount-&s;o|rel;
tho', upon the approach of the count de Perche
with the French army, he de&s;i&s;ted from his enterprize,
and rai&s;ed the &s;iege<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 203.</NOTE>. The count de Perche, elated
with this &s;ucce&s;s, marched to Lincoln; and being ad|mitted
into the town, he began to attack the ca&s;tle,
which he &s;oon reduced to extremity. The protector

&s;ummoned all his forces from every quarter in order to
relieve a place of &s;uch importance; and he appeared &s;o
much &s;uperior to the French, that they &s;hut them&s;elves
up within the city, and re&s;olved to take &s;helter behind
the walls<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Chron. Dun&s;t. vol. 1. p. 81.</NOTE>. But the garri&s;on of the ca&s;tle, having re|ceived
a &s;trong reinforcement, made a vigorous &s;ally up|on
the be&s;iegers; while the Engli&s;h army, by concert,
a&s;&s;aulted them in the &s;ame in&s;tant from without, mount|ed
the walls by &s;calade, and bearing down all re&s;i&s;tance,
entered the city &s;word in hand. Lincoln was delivered
over to be pillaged; the French army was totally routed;
the count de Perche, with only two per&s;ons more, was
killed, but many of the chief commanders and about 400
knights were made pri&s;oners by the Engli&s;h<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 204, 205. Chron. de Mullr. p. 195.</NOTE>. So little
blood was &s;hed in this important action; which decided
the fate of one of the mo&s;t powerful kingdoms of Eu|rope;
and &s;uch wretched &s;oldiers were tho&s;e antient ba|rons,
who yet were unacquainted with every thing but arms.</P>
<P>PRINCE Lewis was informed of this fatal event, while
employed in the &s;iege of Dover, which was &s;till valiantly
defended again&s;t him by Hubert de Burgh. He imme|diately
retreated towards London, which was the center
and life of his party; and he there received intelligence
of a new di&s;a&s;ter, which put an end to all his hopes. A
French fleet bringing over a &s;trong reinforcement, had
appeared on the coa&s;t of Kent, when they were attacked
by the Engli&s;h under the command of Philip d'Albiney,
and were routed and repul&s;ed with con&s;iderable lo&s;s.
D'Albiney practi&s;ed a &s;tratagem again&s;t them, which is
&s;aid to have contributed to the victory: Having gained
the wind of the French, he came down upon them with
violence; and throwing in their faces a great quantity
<PB N="153" REF="170">
of quick-lime, which he purpo&s;ely carried on board, he
&s;o blinded them, that they were di&s;abled from defending
them&s;elves<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 206. Ann. Waverl. p. 183. W. Heming. p. 563. Trivet, p. 169. M. We&s;t. p. 277. Knyghton, p. 2428.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER this &s;econd misfortune of the French,<NOTE PLACE="marg">General pa|cification.</NOTE> the
Engli&s;h barons ha&s;ted every where to make terms of
peace with the protector, and by an early &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, to
prevent tho&s;e forfeitures, to which they were expo&s;ed on
account of their rebellion. Lewis, who&s;e cau&s;e was now
totally de&s;perate, began to be anxious for the &s;afety of
his per&s;on, and was glad, on any honourable conditions,
to make his e&s;cape from a country, where he found, that
every thing was now become ho&s;tile to him. He con|cluded
a peace with Pembroke, promi&s;ed to evacuate the
kingdom, and only &s;tipulated in return, an indemnity
to his adherents, and a re&s;titution of their honours and
fortunes, together with the free and equal enjoyment of
tho&s;e liberties, which had been granted to the re&s;t of the
nation<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 1. p. 221. M. Paris, p. 207. Chron. Dun&s;t. vol. 1. p. 83. M. We&s;t, p. 278. Knyghton, p. 2429.</NOTE>. Thus, was happily ended a civil war, which
&s;eemed to be founded on the mo&s;t incurable hatred and
jealou&s;y, and threatened the kingdom with the mo&s;t fatal
con&s;equences.</P>
<P>THE precautions, which the King of France u&s;ed in
the conduct of this whole affair, are remarkable. He
pretended, that his &s;on had accepted of the offer from the
English barons, without his advice, and contrary to his
inclination: The armies &s;ent to England were levied in
Lewis's name; When that prince came over to France
for aid, his father publickly refu&s;ed to grant him any a&s;|&s;i&s;tance,
and would not &s;o much as admit him to his pre|&s;ence:
Even after Henry's party acquired the a&s;cendant,
and Lewis was in danger of falling into the hands of his
<PB N="154" REF="171">
enemies, it was Blanche of Ca&s;tile his wife, not the
King his father, who rai&s;ed armies and equipped fleets for
his &s;uccour<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 256. Chron. Dun&s;t. vol. i. p. 82.</NOTE>. All the&s;e artifices were employed, not to
&s;atisfy the Pope; for he had too much penetration to be
&s;o ea&s;ily impo&s;ed on: Nor yet to deceive the people; for
they were too gro&s;s even for that purpo&s;e: They only &s;er|ved
for a colouring to Philip's cau&s;e; and in public affairs,
men are often better plea&s;ed, that the truth, tho' known
to every body, &s;hould be wrapt up under a decent cover,
than if it were expo&s;ed in open day-light to the eyes of
all the world.</P>
<P>AFTER the expul&s;ion of the French, the prudence and
equity of the protector's &s;ub&s;equent conduct, contributed
to cure entirely tho&s;e wounds, which had been made by
inte&s;tine di&s;cord. He received the rebellious barons into
favour; ob&s;erved &s;trictly the terms of peace, which he
had granted them; re&s;tored them to their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions;
and endeavoured, by an equal behaviour, to bury all
pa&s;t animo&s;ities in perpetual oblivion. The clergy alone,
who had adhered to Lewis, were &s;ufferers in this revo|lution.
As they had rebelled again&s;t their &s;overeign,
the Pope, by di&s;regarding the interdict and excommunica|tion,
it was not in Pembroke's power to make any &s;tipu|lations
in their favour; and Gualo, the legate, prepared
to take vengeance on them for their di&s;obedience<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Brady's App. No. 144. Chron. Dun&s;t, vol. i, p. 83.</NOTE>. Ma|ny
of them were depo&s;ed; many &s;u&s;pended; &s;ome ba|ni&s;hed;
and all who e&s;caped puni&s;hment, made atonement
for their offences, by paying large &s;ums to the le|gate,
who ama&s;&s;ed an immen&s;e trea&s;ure by this expe|dient.</P>
<P>THE earl of Pembroke &s;urvived not long the pacifica|tion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of the protector.</NOTE>
which had been chiefly owing to his wi&s;dom and
valour<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 210.</NOTE>; and he was &s;ucceeded in the government by
<PB N="155" REF="172">
Peter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some com|motions.</NOTE> bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, a Poictevin, and Hubert
de Burgh, high ju&s;ticiary. The councils of the latter
were chiefly followed; and had he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed equal autho|rity
in the kingdom with Pembroke, he &s;eemed to be
every way worthy of filling the place of that virtuous
citizen. But the licentious and powerful barons, who
had once broke the reins of &s;ubjection to their prince,
and had obtained by violence an enlargement of their
liberties and independance, could ill be re&s;trained by
Jaws under a minority; and the people, no le&s;s than
the King, &s;uffered from their outrages and di&s;orders.
They retained by force the royal ca&s;tles, which they had
u&s;urped during the pa&s;t convul&s;ions, or which had been
committed to their cu&s;tody by the protector<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. 174.</NOTE>: They
u&s;urped the deme&s;nes<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 276.</NOTE>: They oppre&s;&s;ed their va&s;&s;als:
They infe&s;ted their weaker neighbours: And they invi|ted
all di&s;orderly people to enter in their retinue, and to
live upon their lands; and they gave them protection
in all their robberies and extortions.</P>
<P>No one was more infamous for the&s;e violent and ille|gal
practices than the earl of Albemarle, who, tho' he
had early returned to his duty, and had been very &s;er|viceable
in expelling the French, augmented to the ut|mo&s;t
of his power the general licence, which prevailed;
and committed outrages in all the counties of the north.
In order to &s;uppre&s;s his di&s;orders, Hubert &s;eized an op|portunity
of getting po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Rockingham ca&s;tle,
which Albemarle had garri&s;oned with his licentious reti|nue:
But this nobleman, in&s;tead of &s;ubmitting, entered
into a &s;ecret confederacy with Fawkes de Breaut$, Peter
de Mauleon, and other barons, and both fortified the
ca&s;tle of Biham for his defence, and made him&s;elf ma&s;ter
by &s;urprize of that of Fotheringay. Pandulf, who was
re&s;tored to his legate&s;hip in the place of Gualo, was ac|tive

in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing this rebellion; and with the concur|rence
of eleven bi&s;hops, he denounced the &s;entence of
excommunication again&s;t: Albemarle and his adherents<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Chron. Dun&s;t. vol. 1. p. 102.</NOTE>:
An army was levied: A &s;cutage of ten &s;hillings a knight's
fee was impo&s;ed on all the military tenants: Albemarle's
a&s;&s;ociates gradually de&s;erted him: And he him&s;elf was
obliged at la&s;t to &s;ubmit to mercy. He received a par|don,
and was re&s;tored to his whole e&s;tate.</P>
<P>THIS impolitic lenity, too frequent in tho&s;e times,
was probably the re&s;ult of a combination among the ba|rons,
who never could endure to &s;ee the total ruin of one
of their own order: But it encouraged Fawkes de
Breaut$, a man whom King John had rai&s;ed from a low
origin, to per&s;evere in the cour&s;e of violence, to which
he had owed his fortune, and to &s;et at nought all law and
ju&s;tice. When thirty-five verdicts were at one time
found again&s;t him, on account of his violent expul&s;ion of
&s;o many freeholders from their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; he came to
the court of ju&s;tice with an armed force, &s;eized the judge
who had pronounced the &s;entences, and impri&s;oned him
in Bedford ca&s;tle. He then levied open war again&s;t the
King; but being &s;ubdued, and taken pri&s;oner, his life
was granted him; but his e&s;tate was confi&s;cated, and he
was bani&s;hed the kingdom<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 1. p. 198. M. Paris, p. 221, 224. Ann. Waverl. p. 188. Chron, Dun&s;t, vol. 1. p. 141, 146. M. We&s;t. p. 283.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>JUSTICE was executed with greater &s;everity again&s;t

between the Londoners on the one hand, and the
inhabitants of We&s;tmin&s;ter and tho&s;e of the neighbouring
villages on the other, occa&s;ioned this commotion. The

to the abbot of We&s;tmin&s;ter: But this riot,
which; con&s;idering the tumultuous di&s;po&s;ition familiar to
that capital, would have been little regarded, &s;eemed to
become more &s;erious, by the &s;ymptoms, which then
broke out of the former attachment of the citizens to the
French intere&s;t. The populace, in the tumult, made
u&s;e of the cry of war commonly employed by the French
troops; <HI>Mountjoy, mountjoy, God help us and our lord Lewis.</HI>
The ju&s;ticiary made enquiry into the di&s;order; and find|ing
one Con&s;tantine Fitz Arnulf to have been the ring|leader,
an in&s;olent man, who ju&s;tified his crime in Hu|bert's
pre&s;ence, he proceeded again&s;t him by martial law,
and ordered him immediately to be hanged, without trial

<P>THIS act of power was complained of as an infringe|ment
of the great charter: Yet the ju&s;ticiary, in a par|liament,
&s;ummoned at Oxford (for the great councils
began about this time to receive that appellation) made
no &s;cruple to grant in the King's name a renewal and con|firmation
of that charter. When the a&s;&s;embly made ap|plication
to the crown for this favour; as a law in tho&s;e
times &s;eemed to lo&s;e its validity, if not frequently renew|ed;
William de Briewere, one of the council of regen|cy,
was &s;o bold as to &s;ay openly, that the&s;e liberties were
extorted by force, and ought not to be ob&s;erved: But he
was reprimanded by the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, and
was not countenanced by the King or his chief mini|&s;ters<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">M. We&s;t. p. 282.</NOTE>.

<P>THE low &s;tate, into which the crown was now fallen,
made it requi&s;ite for a good mini&s;ter to be attentive to the
pre&s;ervation of the royal prerogatives, as well as to the
&s;ecurity of public liberty. Hubert applied to the Pope,
who had always great authority in the kingdom, and
was now con&s;idered as its &s;uperior lord; and de&s;ired him
to i&s;&s;ue a bull, declaring the king to be of full age, and
entitled to exerci&s;e in per&s;on all the acts of royalty<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 220.</NOTE>. In
con&s;equence of this declaration, the ju&s;ticiary re&s;igned
into Henry's hands the two important fortre&s;&s;es of the
Tower and Dover ca&s;tle, which had been entru&s;ted to
his cu&s;tody and required the other barons to imitate
his example. They refu&s;ed compliance: The earls of
Che&s;ter and Albemarle, John Con&s;table of Che&s;ter, John
de Lacy, Brian de I'I&s;le, and William de Cantel, with
&s;ome others, even formed a con&s;piracy to &s;urprize Lon|don,
and met in arms at Waltham with that intention:
But finding the King prepared for defence, they de&s;i&s;ted
from their enterprize. When &s;ummoned to court, in
order to an&s;wer for their conduct, they &s;crupled not to
appear, and to confe&s;s their de&s;ign: But they told the
King, that they had no bad intentions again&s;t his per&s;on,
but only again&s;t Hubert de Burgh, whom they were determined
to remove from his office<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Chron. Dun&s;t. p 137</NOTE>. They appeared
too formidable to be cha&s;tifed; and they were &s;o little
di&s;couraged by the failure of their fir&s;t enterprize, that
they met again in arms at Leice&s;ter, in order to &s;eize the
King, who then re&s;ided at Northampton: But Henry,
<PB N="159" REF="180">
informed of their purpo&s;e, took care to be &s;o well armed
and attended, that the barons found it dangerous to;
make the attempt; and they? &s;at down and kept their
Chri&s;tmas in his neighbourhood<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 221. Chron. Dun&s;t. vol. 1. p. 138.</NOTE> The archbi&s;hop and

with the &s;entence of excommunication, if they per|&s;i&s;ted
in detaining the King's ca&s;tles. This menace at
la&s;t prevailed: Mo&s;t of the fortre&s;&s;es were &s;urrendered;
tho' the barons complained, that Hubert's ca&s;tles were
&s;oon after re&s;tored to him, while the King &s;till kept
theirs in his own cu&s;tody. There are &s;aid to have been
1115 ca&s;tles at that time in England<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Coke's Comment. on Mag. Charta, chap. 17.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be acknowledged, that the influence of the
prelates and the clergy was often of very great &s;ervice to
the public. Tho' the religion of that age can merit no
other name than that of &s;uper&s;tition, it &s;erved to unite
together a body of men who had great &s;way over the
people, and who kept the community from falling to
pieces, from the factions and independant power of the
nobles. And what was of great con&s;equence; it threw
a mighty authority into the hands of men, who by their
profe&s;&s;ion were aver&s;e to arms and violence; who tem|pered
by their, mediation the general di&s;po&s;ition towards
military enterprizes; and who &s;till maintained, even
amid&s;t the &s;hock of arms, tho&s;e &s;ecret links, without
which it is impo&s;&s;ible for human &s;ociety to &s;ub&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the&s;e ihte&s;tine commotions in
England, and the precarious authority of the crown,
Henry was obliged to carry on war in France, and he
employed to that purpo&s;e the fifteenth which had been
granted him by parliament. Lewis the eighth, who had
&s;ucceeded to his father, Philip, in&s;tead of attending to
<PB N="160" REF="181">
Henry's claim, who demanded the re&s;titution of Nor|mandy
and the other provinces, wre&s;ted from England,
made an irruption into Poictou, took Rochelle<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 1. p. 269. Trivet, p. 179.</NOTE> after a
long &s;iege, and &s;eemed determined to expell the Engli&s;h from
the few provinces, which yet remained to them. Henry
&s;ent over his uncle, the earl of Sali&s;bury; together with
his brother prince Richard, to whom he had granted the
eardom of Cornwal, which had e&s;cheated to the crown,
Sali&s;bury &s;topt the progre&s;s of Lewis's arms, and retained
the Poictevin and Ga&s;con va&s;&s;als in their allegiance: But
no military action of any moment was performed on
either &s;ide. The earl of Cornwal, after two years &s;tay
in Guienne, returned to England.</P>
<P>THIS prince was no wife turbulent or factious in his
di&s;po&s;ition:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1227</NOTE> His ruling pa&s;&s;ion was to ama&s;s money, in
which he &s;ucceeded &s;o well as to become the riche&s;t
prince in Chri&s;tendom: Yet his attention to gain fome|times
threw him into acts of violence, and gave di&s;tur|bance
to the government. There was a manor, which
formerly had belonged to the earldom of Cornwal, but
had been given away to Waleran de Ties, before
Richard had been inve&s;ted with that dignity, and while
the earldom remained in the hands of the crown.
Richard claimed this manor, and expelled the proprietor
by force: Waleran complained: The king ordered his
brother to do ju&s;tice to the man, and re&s;tore him to his
rights: The earl &s;aid, that he would not &s;ubmit to the&s;e
orders, till the cau&s;e was decided again&s;t him by the
judgment of his peers: Henry replied, that it was fir&s;t
requi&s;ite to re-in&s;tate Waleran_ in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, before the
cau&s;e could be tried; and he re-iterated his orders to the
earl<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 233.</NOTE>. We may judge of the &s;tate of the government,
when this affair was like to produce a civil war. The
<PB N="161" REF="182">
earl of Cornwal, finding Henry peremptory in his de|mands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1227</NOTE>
a&s;&s;ociated him&s;elf with the young earl of Pem|broke
who had married his &s;i&s;ter, and who was di&s;con|tented
on account of the King's requiring him to deliver
up &s;ome royal ca&s;tles which were in his cu&s;tody. The&s;e
two noblemen took into their con&s;ederacy the earls of
Che&s;ter, Warenne, Gloce&s;ter, Hereford, Warwic, and
Ferrers, who were all di&s;gu&s;ted on a like account<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 233.</NOTE>. The
malecontents affembled an army, which the King had
not the power or courage to re&s;i&s;t; and he was obliged
to give his brother &s;atisfaction, by grants of much greater
importance than the manor, which had been the fir&s;t ground of the quarrel<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE character of the King, as he grew to man's
e&s;tate, became every day better known, and was found
in every circum&s;tance totally unqualified for maintaining
a proper &s;way among tho&s;e turbulent barons, whom the
feudal con&s;titution &s;ubjected to his authority. Gentle,
humane, and merciful even to a fault, he &s;eems to have
been steady in no other circum&s;tance of his character;
but to have received every impre&s;&s;ion, from tho&s;e who
&s;urrounded him, and whom he loved, for the time, with
the molt imprudent and mo&s;t unre&s;erved affection. With|out
activity or vigour, he was unfit to conduct war;
without policy or art, he was ill fitted to maintain peace:
His re&s;entments, tho' ha&s;ty and violent, were not
dreaded, while he was found to drop them with &s;uch
facility; his friend&s;hips were little valued, becau&s;e they
were neither derived from choice, nor maintained with
con&s;tancy. A proper pageant of &s;tate in a regular monarchy,
where his mini&s;ters could have conducted all affairs
in his name and by his authority; but too feeble in
thole di&s;orderly times to fway a scepter, whole weight
<PB N="162" REF="183">
depended entirely on the firmne&s;s and dexterity of the
hand, which held it.</P>
<P>THE able&s;t and mo&s;t virtuous mini&s;ter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hubert de Burgh di&s;placed.</NOTE> whom Henry
ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1231</NOTE> was Hubert de Burgh<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ypod. Neu&s;triae, p. 464.</NOTE>; a man who had
been Ready to the crown in the mo&s;t difficult and dan|gerous
times, and who yet chewed no di&s;po&s;ition, in the
height of his power, to en&s;lave or oppre&s;s the people.
The only exceptionable part of his conduit is that which
is mentioned by Matthew Paris<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">P. 232. M. We&s;t. p. 216. a&s;cribes this council to Peter Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter.</NOTE>, if the fact is really
true, and proceeded from Hubert's advice, the recalling
publickly and annulling the charter of fore&s;ts, a con|ce&s;&s;ion
&s;o rea&s;onable in it&s;elf, and &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately claimed
both by the nobility and people: But it must be con&s;e&s;&s;ed,
that this mea&s;ure is &s;o unlikely, both from the circum|&s;tances
of the times and character of the mini&s;ter, that
there is great rea&s;on to doubt of its reality, e&s;pecially as
it is mentioned by no other hi&s;torian. Hubert, while he
enjoyed his authority, had an entire a&s;cendent over
Henry, and was loaded with honours and favours be|yond
any other &s;ubject. Be&s;ides acquiring the property
of many ca&s;tles and manors, he married the elde&s;t fi&s;ter
of the King of Scots, was created earl of Kent, and
by an unu&s;ual conce&s;&s;ion, was made chief ju&s;ticiary
of England for life:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1231.</NOTE> Yet Henry, in a &s;udden caprice,
threw off this faithful mini&s;ter, and expo&s;ed him to the
violent per&s;ecutions of his enemies. Among other fri|volous
crimes objected to him, he was accu&s;ed of gain|ing
the King's affections by enchantment, and of pur|loining
from the royal trea&s;ury a gem, which had the
virtue to render the wearer invulnerable, and of fending
this valuable curio&s;ity to the prince of Wales<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 259.</NOTE>. The
nobility, who hated Hubert on account of his zeal in
<PB N="163" REF="184">
re&s;uming the rights and po&s;&s;e&s;ions of the crown, no
&s;ooner &s;aw the opening, than they inflamed the King's
animo&s;ity again&s;t him, and pu&s;hed him to leek the total,
ruin of his mini&s;ter. Hubert took &s;anctuary in a church:
The King ordered him to be dragged from thence: He
recalled tho&s;e orders: He afterwards renewed them: He
was obliged by the clergy to re&s;tore him to the &s;anctuary:
He con&s;trained him &s;oon after to &s;urrender him&s;elf pri&s;o|ner,
and he confined him to the ca&s;tle of the Devi&s;es.
Hubert made his e&s;cape, was expelled the kingdom, was
again received into favour, recovered a great &s;hare of
the King's confidence, but never &s;howed any inclination
of re-in&s;tating him&s;elf in his power and authority<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 259, 260, 261. 266. Chron. T. Wykes, p. 41, 42. Chron. Dun&s;t. vol. i. p. 220, 221. M. We&s;t. p. 291. 301.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter mini&s;ter.</NOTE> who &s;ucceeded him in the government
of the King and kingdom, was Peter des Roches, bi&s;hop
of Winche&s;ter, a Poictevin by birth, who had been rai&s;ed
by the late King, and who was no lets di&s;tingui&s;hed by
his arbitrary principles and violent conduct, than by his
courage and abilities. This prelate had been left by
King John ju&s;ticiary and regent of the kingdom during
an expedition which that prince made into France; and
his illegal admini&s;tration was one chief cau&s;e of that
great combination among the barons, which finally ex|torted
from the crown the charter of liberties, and laid
the foundation of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution. Henry, tho'
incapable, from his character, of pur&s;uing the &s;ame vio|lent
maxims, which had governed his father, had imbi|bed
the &s;ame arbitrary principles; and in pro&s;ecution of
Peter's advice, he invited over a great number of Poicte|vins
and other foreigners, who; he believed, could more
&s;afely be tru&s;ted than the Engli&s;h, and who &s;eemed requi|&s;ite
to counterbalance the great and independant power
<PB N="164" REF="185">
of the nobility.<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 263.</NOTE> Every office and command was be|&s;towed
on the&s;e &s;trangers; their rapacity exhau&s;ted the
revenues of the crown, already too much impoveri&s;hed<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Chron. Dun&s;t. vol. i. p. 151.</NOTE>;
they invaded the rights of the people; and their in&s;olence,
&s;till more provoking than their power, drew on them the
hatred and envy of all orders of men in the kingdom<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 258.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE barons formed a combination again&s;t this odious
mini&s;try,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1233</NOTE> and withdrew from their attendance in parliament;
on pretence of the danger, to which they were expo&s;ed from
the machinations of the Poictevins. When again &s;ummon|ed
to attend, they gave for an&s;wer, that the King should
di&s;imi&s; his foreigners from court: Otherwi&s;e they would
drive both him and them out of the kingdom, and put the
crown on another head, more worthy of wearing it<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p 265.</NOTE>: Such
was the &s;tyle, which they u&s;ed to their &s;overeign! They
at la&s;t came to parliament, but &s;o well attended with
armed followers, that they &s;eemed in a condition to pre|&s;cribe
laws to the King and mini&s;try,. Peter des Roches,
however, had in the interval found means of &s;owing
diffention among the barons, and of bringing over to his
party the earl of Cornwal, as well as the earls of Lincoln
and Che&s;ter. The con&s;ederates were di&s;concerted in
their mea&s;ures: Richard, earl Mari&s;chal, who had &s;uc|ceeded
to that dignity on the death of his brother, Wil|liam,
was cha&s;ed into Wales; he thence withdrew into
Ireland; where he was treacherou&s;ly murdered by the
contrivance of the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Chron. Dun&s;t. vol. i. p. 219.</NOTE>. The e&s;tates
of the more obnoxious barons were confi&s;cated, without
legal &s;entence or trial by their peers<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 265.</NOTE>; and were be&s;tow|ed
with a profu&s;e liberality on the Poictevins. Peter
even carried his in&s;olence &s;o far as to &s;ay publicly, that
the barons of England mu&s;t not pretend to put them|&s;elves
<PB N="165" REF="186">
on the &s;ame footing with tho&s;e of France, or
a&s;&s;ume the &s;ame liberties and privileges: The monarch
had a more ab&s;olute power in the one country than in
the other. It would have been more ju&s;ti&s;iable for him
to &s;ay, that men, &s;o unwilling to &s;ubmit to the authority
of laws, could with the wor&s;e grace claim any &s;helter or
protecion from them.</P>
<P>WHEN the King, at any time, was checked in his il|legal
practices, and the authority of the great charter was
objected to him, he was wont to reply; &startq;Why &s;hould
I ob&s;erve a charter, which is neglected by all my grandees,
both prelates and nobility?&endq; It was very rea&s;onably re|plied:
&startq;You ought, &s;ir, to &s;et them the example.&endq;<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 609.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>So violent a mini&s;try as that of the bi&s;hop of Win|che&s;ter,
could not be of long duration; but its fall pro|ceeded
at la&s;t from the influence of the church, not from
the efforts of the nobles. Edmond, the pre&s;ent primate,
came to court, attended by many of the other prelates;
and repre&s;ented to the King the pernicious mea&s;ures em|braced
by Peter des Roches, the di&s;contents of his people,
the ruin of his affairs; and after requiring the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion
of the mini&s;ter and his a&s;&s;ociates, threatened him with
the &s;entence of excommunication, in ca&s;e of his refu&s;al.
Henry, who knew that an excommunication, &s;o agreeable
to the &s;en&s;e of the people, could not fail of operating the
mo&s;t dangerous effects, was obliged to &s;ubmit: Fo|reigners
were bani&s;hed: The natives were re&s;tored to
their place in council<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">M, Paris, p. 271, 272.</NOTE>: The primate, who was a man
of prudence, and who took care to execute the laws and
ob&s;erve the charter of liberties, bore the chief &s;way in the
government.</P>
<P>BUT the Engli&s;h in vain flattered them&s;elves that they
would be long free from the dominion of foreigners.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1236</NOTE> The
King, having married Eleanor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">14th Ja|nuary.</NOTE> daughter to the count of
<PB N="166" REF="187">
Provence<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 448. M. Paris, p. 286.</NOTE>, was &s;urrounded by a great number of &s;tran|gers

The bi&s;hop of Valence, a prelate of the hou&s;e of
Savoy, and maternal uncle to the queen, was his chief
mini&s;ter, and employed every art to ama&s;s wealth for him|&s;elf
and his relations. Peter de Savoy, another brother
of the &s;ame family, was inve&s;ted in the honour of Rich|mond,
and received the rich ward&s;hip of earl Warrenne:
Boniface de Savoy was promoted to the &s;ee of Canter&s;bury:
Many young ladies were invited over from Pro|vence,
and married to the chief noblemen of England,
who were the King's wards<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 484. M, We&s;t. p. 338.</NOTE>: And as the &s;ource of
Henry's bounty began to fail, his Savoyard mini&s;try
applied to Rome, and obtained a bull; permitting him
to re&s;ume all pa&s;t grants; ab&s;olving him from the oath,
which he had taken to maintain them; even enjoining
him to make &s;uch a re&s;umption, and repre&s;enting the&s;e
grants as invalid, on account of the prejudice which en|&s;ued from them to the Roman pontiff, in whom the &s;u|periority of the kingdom was ve&s;ted<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 295. 301.</NOTE>. The oppo&s;ition,
made to the intended re&s;umption, prevented it from ta|king
effect; but the nation faw the indignities, to which
the King was willing to &s;ubmit, in order to gratify the
avarice of his foreign favourites. About the &s;ame time,
he publi&s;hed in England the &s;entence of excommunication,
denounced again&s;t the emperor Frederic, his brother in
law<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 383.</NOTE> and &s;aid in excu&s;e, that, being the Pope's va&s;&s;al,
he was obliged by his allegiance to obey all the com|mands
of his holine&s;s. In this weak reign, when any
neighbour in&s;ulted the King's dominions, in&s;tead of ta|king
revenge for the injury, he complained to the Pope
<PB N="167" REF="188">
as his &s;uperior lord, and begged him to give protection<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grievances.</NOTE>
to his va&s;&s;al<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Chron. Dun&s;t. vol. i. p. 150.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE re&s;entment of the Engli&s;h barons ro&s;e high at the
preference given to foreigners; but no remon&s;rrances and
complaints could ever prevail on the king to abandon
them, or even to moderate his attachment towards them.
After the Proven$als and Savoyards might have been &s;up|po&s;ed
pretty well &s;atiated with the dignities and riches,
which they had acquired, a new let of hungry foreigners
were invited over, and &s;hared among them tho&s;e favours,
which the King ought in policy to have conferred on
the Engli&s;h nobility, by whom his government could
have been &s;upported and defended. His mother, I&s;abella,
who had been unju&s;tly taken by the late King from the
count de la Marche, to whom &s;he was betrothed, was
no &s;ooner mi&s;tre&s;s of her&s;elf by the death of her hu&s;band,
than the married that nobleman<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. 174.</NOTE>; and &s;he had born him
four &s;ons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1247.</NOTE> Guy, William, Geoffrey, and Aymer, whom
&s;he &s;ent over into England to pay a vi&s;it to their brother.
The good-natured and affectionate di&s;po&s;ition of Henry
was moved at the fight of &s;uch near relations; and he
confidered neither his own circum&s;tances, nor the hu|mours
of his people, in the honours and riches, which
he conferred upon them.<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 491. M. We&s;t. p. 338. Knyghton, p. 2436.</NOTE>. Complaints rote as loud
again&s;t the credit of the Ga&s;con as ever they had done
again&s;t that of the Poictevin and Savoyard favourites; and
to a nation prejudiced again&s;t them, all their mea&s;ures
appeared criminal and exceptionable. Violations of the
great charter were frequently mentioned; and it is in|deed
more than likely, that foreigners, ignorant of the
laws, and relying on the boundle&s;s affections of a weak
prince, would, in an age, when a regular admini&s;tration
was not any where known, pay more attention to their
<PB N="168" REF="189">
own prevent intere&s;t than to the liberties of the people.
It is reported, that the Poictevins and other &s;trangers,
when the laws were at any time appealed to, in oppo&s;i|tion
to their oppre&s;&s;ions, &s;crupled not to reply, <HI>What did
the Engli&s;h laws &s;ignify to them? They minded them not.</HI>
And as words are often more offen&s;ive than actions, this
open contempt of the Engli&s;h tended much to aggravate
the general di&s;content, and made every act of violence,
committed by the foreigners, appear not only an injury,
but an affront to them<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 566. 666. Ann. Waverl. p. 214. Chron. Dun&s;t. vol. i. p. 335.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IRECKON not among the violations of the great charter
&s;ome arbitrary exertions of prerogative, which Henry's
nece&s;&s;ities obliged him to practi&s;e, and which, without
producing any di&s;content, were uniformly continued
by all his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, till the la&s;t century. As the par|liament
often refu&s;ed him &s;upplies, and that in a manner
&s;omewhat rude and indecent<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 301.</NOTE>, he obliged his opulent
&s;ubjects, particularly the citizens of London, to grant
him loans of money; and it is natural to imagine, that
the &s;ame want of oeconomy, which reduced him to the
nece&s;&s;ity of borrowing, would prevent him from being
very punctual in the payment<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 406.</NOTE>. He demanded benevo|lences
or pretended voluntary contributions from his no|bility
and prelates<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 507.</NOTE>. He was the fir&s;t King of England
&s;ince the conque&s;t, who could fairly be &s;aid to lye under
the re&s;traint of law; and he was al&s;o the fir&s;t who prac|ti&s;ed
the di&s;pen&s;ing power, and employed the famous
clau&s;c of <HI>Non-ob&s;iante</HI> in his grants and patents. When
objections were made to this novelty, he replied, that
the Pope exerci&s;ed that authority; and why might he not
imitate the example? But the abu&s;e, which the Pope
made of his di&s;pen&s;ing power, in violating the canons of
<PB N="169" REF="190">
general councils, in invading the privileges and cu&s;toms
of all particular churches, and in u&s;urping on the rights
of patrons, was more likely to excite the jealou&s;y of the
people, than to reconcile them to a &s;imilar practice in
their civil government. Roger de Thurke&s;by, one of
the King's ju&s;tices, was &s;o di&s;plea&s;ed with the precedent,
that he exclaimed, <HI>Alas! what times, are we fallen into?
Behold, the civil court is corrupted in imitation of the eccle|&s;ia&s;tical,
and the river is poi&s;oned from that fountain.</HI></P>
<P>THE King's partiality and profu&s;e bounty to his fo|reign
relations, and to their friends and favourites, would
have appeared more tolerable to the Engli&s;h, had any thing
been done mean-while for the honour of the nation, or had
Henry's enterprizes in foreign countries, been attended
with any &s;ucce&s;s or glory to him&s;elf or to the public: At
lea&s;t, &s;uch military talents in the King would have &s;erved
to keep his barons in awe, and have given weight and
authority to his government. But tho' he declared war
again&s;t Lewis IX. in 1242, and made an expedition into
Guienne, upon the invitation of his father in law, the
count de la Marche, who promi&s;ed to join him with all
his forces; he was un&s;ucce&s;sful in his attempts again&s;t
that great monarch, was wor&s;ted at Taillebourg; was de|&s;erted

<P>BUT the grievances,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal grievan|ces.</NOTE> which the Engli&s;h had rea&s;on
to complain of in the civil government during this reign,
&s;eem to have been &s;till le&s;s grievous than tho&s;e which
they underwent from the u&s;urpations and exactions
of the court of Rome. On the death of Langton in
1228, the monks of Chri&s;t-church elected Walter de
Heme&s;ham, one of their own body, for his &s;ucce&s;&s;or:
But as Henry refu&s;ed to confirm the election, the Pope,
at his de&s;ire, annulled it<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 244.</NOTE>; and immediately appointed
Richard, chancellor of Lincoln, for archbi&s;hop, without
waiting for a new election. On the death of Richard in
1231, the monks elected Ralph de Neville bi&s;hop of Chi|che&s;ter;
and tho' Henry was much plea&s;ed with the elec|tion,
the Pope, who thought that prelate too much at|tached
to the crown, a&s;&s;umed the power of annulling his
election<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 254.</NOTE>. He rejected two clergymen more, whom the
<PB N="171" REF="192">
monks had &s;ucce&s;&s;ively cho&s;en; and he at la&s;t told them,
that, if they would elect Edmond, trea&s;urer of the church
of Sali&s;bury, he would confirm their choice; and his no|mination
was complied with. The Pope had the pru|dence
to appoint both times very worthy primates; but
men could not forbear ob&s;erving his intention of thus
drawing gradually to him&s;elf the right of be&s;towing that
important dignity.</P>
<P>THE avarice, however, more than ambition of the &s;ee
of Rome, &s;eems to have been in this age the ground of
general complaint; and the papal mini&s;ters, finding a va&s;t&s;&s;tock
of power, ama&s;&s;ed by their predece&s;&s;ors, were de&s;i|rous
of turning it to pre&s;ent profit, which they enjoyed
at home, rather than of enlarging their authority in di|&s;tant
countries, where they never intended to re&s;ide.
Every thing was become venal in the Romi&s;h tribunals;
&s;imony was openly practi&s;ed; no favours and even no
ju&s;tice could be obtained without a bribe; the highe&s;t
bidder was &s;ure to have the preference, without regard
either to the merits of the per&s;on or of the cau&s;e; and
be&s;ides the u&s;ual perver&s;ions of right in the deci&s;ion of
controver&s;ies, the Pope openly a&s;&s;umed an ab&s;olute and
uncontroled authority of &s;etting a&s;ide, by the plenitude
of his apo&s;tolic power, all particular rules and privileges

tenth of all eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues, which he levied in a

the avarice of the Romi&s;h church; and they repre&s;ented

were found to amount to 60,000 marks<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Innocent's bull in Rymer, vol. i. p. 471. &s;ays only 50,000 marks a year.</NOTE> a year, a &s;um

They obtained only an eva&s;ive an&s;wer from the Pope;
but as mention had been made before the council, of
the feudal &s;ubjection of England to the &s;ee of Rome, the
English agents, at who&s;e head was Roger Bigod, earl of
Norfolk, exclaimed again&s;t that preten&s;ion, and in&s;i&s;ted,
that King John had no right, without the con&s;ent of
his barons, to &s;ubject the kingdom to &s;o ignominious a
&s;ervitude<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 460.</NOTE>. The Popes indeed, afraid of carrying mat|ters

<P>THIS check, received at the council of Lyons, was
not able to &s;top the court of Rome in its career: Inno|cent
exacted the revenues of all vacant benefices, the

the third of &s;uch as exceeded a hundred marks a

He claimed the goods of all inte&s;tate clergymen<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 474.</NOTE>; he
pretended a title to inherit all money got by u&s;ury; he
levied voluntary contributions from the people; and
when the King, contrary to his u&s;ual practice, prohi|bited
the&s;e exactions, he threatened to denounce again&s;t
him the &s;ame cen&s;ures, which he had emitted again&s;t the emperor, Frederic<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 476.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT the mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive expedient,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1255</NOTE> employed by the
Popc, was the embarking Henry in an enterprize for the
conque&s;t of Naples, or Sicily on this &s;ide the Fare, as
it was called; an affair, which threw much di&s;honour
on the King, and involved him, during &s;ome years, in
great expence and trouble. The Romi&s;h church, taking
advantage of favourable incidents, had reduced the king|dom
of Sicily to the &s;ame &s;tate of feudal va&s;&s;alage,
which the pretended to extend over England, and which,
by rea&s;on of the di&s;tance, as well as high &s;pirit of this
latter kingdom, &s;he was not able to maintain. After
the death of the emperor, Frederic II. the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of
Sicily devolved to Conradine, grand&s;on to that monarch;
and Mainfroy, his natural &s;on, under pretence of go|verning
the kingdom during the infancy of the prince,
had formed a &s;cheme of e&s;tabli&s;hing his own authority.
Pope Innocent IV. who had carried on violent war again&s;t
the emperor, Frederic, and endeavoured to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s him
of his Italian dominions, &s;till continued ho&s;tilities again&s;t
his grand&s;on; but being di&s;appointed in all his &s;chemes
by the activity and arti&s;ices of Mainfroy, he found, that
his own force alone was not &s;ufficient to bring to a
<PB N="175" REF="196">
happy i&s;&s;ue &s;o great an enterprise. He pretended to di&s;|po&s;e
of the Sicilian crown, both as &s;uperior lord of that
particular kingdom, and as vicar of Chri&s;t, to whom all
kingdoms of the earth were &s;ubjected; and he made a
tender of it to Richard earl of Cornwal, who&s;e immen&s;e riches,
he flattered him&s;elf, would be able to &s;upport
the military operations again&s;t Mainfroy. As Richard
had the prudence to refu&s;e the pre&s;ent<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 650.</NOTE>, he applied to
the King, who&s;e levity and thoughtle&s;s di&s;po&s;ition gave
him more hopes of &s;ucce&s;s; and he offered him the
crown of Sicily for his &s;econd &s;on, Edmond<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Rymer, p. 502. 512. 530. M. Paris, p 599 613.</NOTE>. Henry,
allured by &s;o magnificent a gift, without reflecting on the
con&s;equences, without con&s;ulting either with his brother
or the parliament, accepted of this in&s;idious propo&s;al;
and gave the Pope unlimited credit to expend whatever
&s;ums he thought nece&s;&s;ary for compleating the conque&s;t
of Sicily. Innocent, who was engaged by his own intere&s;ts
to make war with Mainfroy, was glad to carry
on his enterprises at the expence of his ally: Alexander
IV. who &s;ucceeded him in the papal throne, continued
the &s;ame policy: And Henry was &s;urprized to find him&s;elf
on a &s;udden involved in an immen&s;e debt, which he
had never been con&s;ulted in contracting. The &s;um already
amounted to 135541 marks be&s;ide intere&s;t<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 587. Chron. Dun&s;t. vol. i. p. 319.</NOTE>; and he had
the pro&s;pect, if he an&s;wered this demand, of being &s;oon
loaded with more exorbitant expences; if he refu&s;ed it,
of both incurring the Pope's di&s;plea&s;ure, and of lo&s;ing
the crown of Sicily, which he hoped &s;oon to have the
glory of fixing on the head of his &s;on.</P>
<P>HE applied to the parliament for &s;upply; and that he
might be &s;ecure of not meeting with oppo&s;ition, he &s;ent,
no writs to the more refractory barons: But even tho&s;e
<PB N="176" REF="197">
who were &s;ummoned, &s;en&s;ible of the ridiculous cheat
impo&s;ed. by the Pope, determined not to lavi&s;h their
money on &s;uch chimerical projects, and making a pre|text
of the ab&s;ence of their brethren, they refu&s;ed to
take the King's demands into con&s;ideration<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 614.</NOTE>. In this
extremity the clergy were his only re&s;ource; and as both
their temporal and &s;piritual &s;overeign concurred in loading
them, they were ill able to defend them&s;elves again&s;t
this united authority.</P>
<P>THE Pope publi&s;hed a cru&s;ade for the conque&s;t of Si|cily;
and required every one, who had taken the cro&s;s
again&s;t the infidels, or had vowed to advance money for
their enterprize, to turn the war again&s;t Mainfroy, a more
terrible enemy to the chri&s;tian faith than any Saracen<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 547, 548. &amp;c.</NOTE>,
He levied a tenth on all eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices in Eng|land
for three years; and gave orders to excommunicate
all bi&s;hops, who made not punctual payment. He granted
to the King the goods of inte&s;tate clergymen; the re|venues
of vacant benefices; the revenues of all non-re|&s;idents<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 597, 598.</NOTE>.
But the&s;e taxations, being levied by &s;ome rule,
were deemed le&s;s grievous, than another arbitrary impo&s;ition,

<P>THAT prelate, who re&s;ided at the court of Rome by
a deputation from the Engli&s;h church, drew bills of different
values, but amounting on the whole to 150540

and granted the&s;e bills to Italian merchants, who, it was

&s;uch an extraordinary demand, Ru&s;tand, the legate,
was charged with the office of employing his authority
to that purpo&s;e; and he &s;ummoned an a&s;&s;embly of the
bi&s;hops and abbots, whom he acquainted with the Pope's
and the King's plea&s;ure. Great were the &s;urprize and
indignation of the a&s;&s;embly at the impo&s;ition: The bi|&s;hop
of Worce&s;ter exclaimed, that he would lo&s;e his life
rather than comply: The bi&s;hop of London &s;aid, that
the Pope and King were more powerful than he; but
if his mitre were taken off his head, he would clap on
a helmet in its place<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 614.</NOTE>. The legate was no le&s;s violent
on the other hand; and he told the a&s;&s;embly, in plain
terms, that all eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices were the property
of the Pope, and he might di&s;po&s;e of them, either in
whole or in part, as he &s;aw proper<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 619.</NOTE>. In the end, the
bi&s;hops and abbots, being threatened with excommuni|cation,
which made all their revenues fall into the
King's hands, were obliged to &s;ubmit to the exaction:
And the only mitigation which the legate allowed them,
was, that the tenths, already granted, &s;hould be ac|cepted
as a partial payment of the bills. But the money
was &s;till in&s;ufficient for the Pope's purpo&s;e: The conque&s;t
of Sicily was as remote as ever: The demands
which came from Rome were endle&s;s: Pope Alexander
became &s;o urgent a creditor, that he &s;ent over a legate
into England; threatening the kingdom with an interdict,
and the King with excommunication, if the arrears,
which he pretended to be due to him, were not
in&s;tantly remitted<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 624. M. Paris, p. 648.</NOTE>: And at la&s;t, Henry, &s;en&s;ible of the

as well as weakened that crown, which they
were at la&s;t induced, from the fear of wor&s;e con&s;equen|ces,

King's &s;ituation, either great abilities and vigour were
requi&s;ite to overawe the barons, or great caution and re|&s;erve
to give them no pretence for complaints; and it
mu&s;t be con&s;e&s;&s;ed, that this prince was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of neither

grievances, demanded in return that he &s;hould give them

as of a&s;&s;ociations to maintain them, which would have
reduced the King to be an ab&s;olute cypher, and have
held the crown in perpetual pupillage and dependance.
The King, to &s;atisfy them, would agree to nothing but
a renewal of the charter, and a general permi&s;&s;ion to ex|communicate

which was expre&s;sly annexed to their feudal tenures.</P>
<P>FOUR years after, in a very full parliament, when
Henry demanded a new &s;upply, he was openly reproached
with the breach of his word, and the frequent viola|tions
of the charter. He was a&s;ked, whether he did not
blu&s;h to de&s;ire any aid from his people, whom he profe&s;|&s;edly
hated and de&s;pi&s;ed, to whom on all occa&s;ions he
preferred aliens and foreigners, and who groaned under
the oppre&s;&s;ions, which he either permitted or exerci&s;ed
over them. He was told, that, be&s;ides di&s;paraging his
nobility by forcing them to contract unequal and mean
marriages with &s;trangers, no rank of men were &s;o low as
to e&s;cape vexations from him or his mini&s;ters; that even
the victuals con&s;umed in his hou&s;hold, the cloaths which
him&s;elf and his &s;ervants wore, &s;till more the wine, which
they u&s;ed, were all taken by violence from the lawful
<PB N="181" REF="202">
owners, and no compen&s;ation was ever made them for
the injury; that foreign merchants, to the great preju|dice
and infamy of the kingdom, &s;hunned the Engli&s;h
harbours, as if they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by pyrates, and the
commerce with all nations was thus cut off by the&s;e vio|lences;
that lots was added to lots, and injury to injury,
while the merchants, who had been de&s;poiled of their
goods, were al&s;o obliged to carry them at their own
charges to whatever place the King was plea&s;ed to ap|point
them; that even the poor fi&s;hermen on the coa&s;t
could not e&s;cape his oppre&s;&s;ions and tho&s;e of his courtiers,
and finding that they had not the full liberty of di&s;po&s;ing
of their commodities in the Engli&s;h market, were fre|quently
con&s;trained to carry them to foreign ports, and
to hazard all the perils of the ocean rather than tho&s;e
which awaited them from his oppre&s;&s;ive emi&s;&s;aries; and
that his very religion was a ground of complaint to his
&s;ubjects, while they ob&s;erved, that the waxen tapers and
&s;plendid &s;ilks, employed in &s;o many u&s;ele&s;s proce&s;&s;ions,
were the &s;poils which he had forcibly ravi&s;hed from the
true po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 498. See farther&punc; p. 578. M. We&s;t. p. 348.</NOTE>. Throughout this remon&s;trance, in
which the complaints, derived from an abu&s;e of the an|tient
right of purveyance, may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;ome|what
exaggerated, there appears a &s;trange mixture of re|gal
tyranny in the practices which gave ri&s;e to it, and of
ari&s;tocratical liberty or rather licentiou&s;ne&s;s in the expre&s;|&s;ions
employed by the parliament. But a mixture of
this kind is ob&s;ervable in all the antient feudal govern|ments;
and both of them proved equally hurtful to the
people.</P>
<P>As the King, in an&s;wer to their remon&s;trance, gave
the parliament only good words and fair promi&s;es, at|tended
with the mo&s;t humble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions, which they
had often found deceitful, he obtained at that time no
<PB N="182" REF="203">
&s;upply; and therefore in the year 1253, when he
found him&s;elf again under the nece&s;&s;ity of applying to parliament,
he had provided him&s;elf of a new pretence, which
he deemed infallible, and taking the vow of a Cru&s;ade
to the holy land, he demanded their a&s;&s;i&s;tance in that pi|ous
enterprize<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 518, 558, 568. Chron. Dun&s;t. vol. i. p. 293.</NOTE>. The parliament, however, for &s;ome
time &s;crupled compliance; and the eccle&s;ia&s;tical order sent
a deputation of four prelates, the primate, the bi&s;hops of
Winche&s;ter, Salisbury, and Carli&s;le, in order to remon|&s;trate
with him on his frequent violations of their privi|leges,
the oppre&s;&s;ions with which he loaded them and
all his &s;ubjects<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 568.</NOTE>, and the uncanonical and forced electi|ons,
which were made to vacant dignities. &startq;It is true,&endq;
replied the King,
&startq;I have been &s;omewhat faulty in this
particular: I obtruded you, my lord of Canterbury,
upon your &s;ee: I was obliged to employ both entrea|ties
and menaces, my lord of Winche&s;er, to have
you elected: my proceedings were very irregular, my
lords of Salisbury and Carli&s;le, when I rai&s;ed you from
the lowe&s;t nations to your pre&s;ent dignities: I am de|termined
henceforth to correct the&s;e errors; and it
will al&s;o become you, in order to make a thorough
reformation, to re&s;ign your pre&s;ent benefices; and try
to enter again in a more regular and canonical man|ner
<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 579.</NOTE>.&endq; The bi&s;hops, &s;urprized at the&s;e unexpected
&s;arca&s;ms, replied, that the que&s;tion was not at pre&s;ent
how to correct pa&s;t errors, but to avoid them for the future.
The King promi&s;ed redre&s;s both of eccle&s;ia&s;tical
and civil grievances; and the parliament in return agreed
to grant him a &s;upply, a tenth of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical be|nefices
and a &s;cutage of three marks on each knight's
fee: But as they had experienced his frequent breach of
promi&s;e, they required, that he &s;hould ratify the great
<PB N="183" REF="204">
charter in a manner &s;till more authentic and &s;olemn than
any which he had ever hitherto employed. All the pre|lates
and abbots were a&s;&s;embled: They held burning
tapers in their hands: The great charter was read before
them: They denounced the &s;entence of excommunica|tion
again&s;t every one who &s;hould thenceforth violate that
fundamental law: They threw their tapers on the
ground, and exclaimed, <HI>May the &s;oul of every one, who
incurs this &s;entence, &s;o &s;tink and corrupt in Hell!</HI> The King
bore a part in this ceremony: and &s;ubjoined;
&startq;So help
me God, I will keep all the&s;e things inviolate, as I
am a man, as I am a chri&s;tian, as I am a knight, and
as I am a King crowned and anointed<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 580. Ann. Burt. p. 323. Ann. Waverl. p. 210. W. Heming. p. 571. M. We&s;t. p. 353.</NOTE>.&endq; Yet was
the tremendous ceremony no &s;ooner finished, than his
favourites, abu&s;ing his weakne&s;s and facility, made him
return to the &s;ame arbitrary and irregular admini&s;tration;
and the rea&s;onable expectations of his people were thus
continually eluded and di&s;appointed<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 597, 608.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e imprudent and illegal mea&s;ures afforded a
pretence to Simon de Mountfort,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1258</NOTE> earl of Leice&s;ter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Simon de Mountfort earl of Lei|ce&s;ter.</NOTE> to
attempt an innovation in the government, and to wre&s;t
the &s;cepter from the feeble and irre&s;olute hand which
$word$. This nobleman was a younger &s;on of that Si|$$$
$word$ Mountfort, who had conducted with &s;uch valour
and renown the Cru&s;ade again&s;t the Albigen&s;es, and who,
tho' he tarnished his famous exploits by cruelty and am|bition,
had left a name very precious to all the bigots of
that age, particularly to the eccle&s;ia&s;tics. A large inhe|ritance
in England fell by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to this, family; but
as the elder brother enjoyed &s;till more opulent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions
in France, and could not perform fealty to two ma&s;ters,
he transferred his right to Simon, his younger brother,
<PB N="184" REF="205">
who came over into England, did homage for his lands,
and was rai&s;ed to the dignity of earl of Leice&s;ter. In the
year 1238, he e&s;pou&s;ed Eleanor dowager of William earl
of Pembroke, and &s;i&s;ter to the King<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 314.</NOTE>; but the marriage
of this prince&s;s with a &s;ubject and a foreigner, though
fini&s;hed with Henry's con&s;ent, was loudly complained of
by the earl of Cornwal, and all the barons of England;
and Leice&s;ter was &s;upported again&s;t their violence, en|tirely
by the King's favour and authority<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">M, Paris, p. 315</NOTE>. But he had
no &s;ooner e&s;tabli&s;hed him&s;elf in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and digni|ties,
than he acquired by in&s;inuation and addre&s;s, a &s;trong
intere&s;t with the nation, and gained equally the affections
of all orders of men. He lo&s;t, however, the friend&s;hip
of Henry from the u&s;ual levity and ficklene&s;s of that
prince; he was bani&s;hed the court; he was recalled; he
was entru&s;ted with the command of Guienne<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 459, 51$.</NOTE>, where he
did good &s;ervice and acquired honour; he was again di&s;|graced
by the King, and his bani&s;hment from court
&s;eemed now final and irrevocable. Henry called him a
traitor to his face: Leice&s;ter gave him the lye, and told
him, that, if he were not his &s;overeign, he would &s;oon
make him repent of that in&s;ult. Yet was this quarrel
accommodated either from the good-nature or timidity
of the King; and Leice&s;ter was again admitted into
&s;ome degree of favour and authority. But as this noble|man
was become too great to pre&s;erve an entire complai|&s;ance
to Henry's humours, and to act in &s;ub&s;erviency to
his other minions; he found more advantage in cultivat|ing
his intere&s;t with the public, and in inflaming the ge|neral
di&s;contents, which prevailed again&s;t the admini&s;tra|tion.
He filled every place with complaints again&s;t the
infringement of the great charter, the violences commit|ted
on the people, the combination between the Pope
<PB N="185" REF="206">
and the King in their tyranny and extortions, Henry's
neglect of his native &s;ubjects and barons; and tho' him|&s;elf
a foreigner, he was more loud than any in repre&s;ent|ing
the indignity of &s;ubmitting to the dominion of fo|reigners.
By his hypocritical preten&s;ions to devotion,
he gained the favour of the zealots and clergy: By his
&s;eeming concern for public good, he acquired the affec|tions
of the public: And be&s;ides the private friend&s;hips,
which he had cultivated with the barons, his animo&s;ity
again&s;t the favourites bred an union of intere&s;ts between
him and that powerful order.</P>
<P>A RECENT quarrel, which broke out between Leice&s;ter
and William de Valence, Henry's half brother, and chief
favourite, brought matters to extremity<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 649.</NOTE>, and deter|mined
the former to give full &s;cope to his bold and un|bounded
ambition, which the laws and the King's au|thority
had hitherto with difficulty restrained. He &s;e|cretly
called a meeting of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable barons,
particularly Humphrey de Bohun, high con&s;table, Roger
Bigod, earl mare&s;chal, and the earls of Warwick and
Gloce&s;ter; men, who by their family and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions
&s;tood in the fir&s;t rank of the Engli&s;h nobility. He repre|&s;ented
to this company the nece&s;&s;ity of reforming the
&s;tate, and of putting the execution of the laws into other
hands than tho&s;e which had hitherto appeared, from re|peated
experience, &s;o unfit for the charge, with which
they were entrusted. He exaggerated the oppre&s;&s;ions of
the lower orders of the &s;tate, the violations of the barons'
privileges, the continued plunder of the clergy; and in order
to aggravate the enormity of this conduct, he appealed to
the great charter, which Henry had &s;o often ratified, and
which was calculated to prevent for ever the return of the&s;e
intolerable grievances. He magnified the genero&s;ity of their
ance&s;tors, who, at an infinite expence of blood, had ex|torted
<PB N="186" REF="207">
that famous conce&s;&s;ion from the crown; but la|mented
their own degeneracy, who allowed &s;o great an
advantage, once obtained, to be wre&s;ted from them by a
weak prince and by in&s;olent &s;trangers. And he in&s;i&s;ted,
that the King's word, after &s;o many &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions and
fruitle&s;s promi&s;es on his part, could no longer be relied on;
and that nothing but his ab&s;olute inability to violate na|tional
privileges could henceforth en&s;ure the regular ob|&s;ervance
of them.</P>
<P>THESE topics, which were founded in truth, and &s;uit|ed
&s;o well the &s;entiments of the company, had the de&s;ired
effect; and the barons entered into a re&s;olution of re|dre&s;&s;ing
the public grievances, by taking into their own
hands the admini&s;tration of the government. The King
having &s;ummoned a parliament, in expectation of receiv|ing
&s;upplies for his Sicilian project, the barons appeared
in the hall, clad in complete armour, and with their
&s;words by their &s;ide; and the King on his entry,. &s;truck
with this unu&s;ual appearance, a&s;ked them what was their
meaning, and whether they pretended to make him their
pri&s;oner<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Annal. Theoke&s;bury.</NOTE>? Roger Bigod replied in the name of the re&s;t,
that he was not their pri&s;oner, but their &s;overeign; that
they even intended to grant him large &s;upplies, in order
to fix his &s;on on the throne of Sicily; that they only ex|pected
&s;ome return for this expence and &s;ervice; and
that, as he had frequently made &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to the parlia|ment,
had acknowledged his pa&s;t errors, and had &s;till allow|ed
him&s;elf to be carried into the &s;ame path, which gave
them &s;uch ju&s;t rea&s;on of complaint, he mu&s;t now yield to
more &s;trict regulations, and confer authority on tho&s;e
who were able and willing to redre&s;s the public grievan|ces.
Henry, partly allured by the hopes of &s;upply,
partly intimidated by the union and martial appearance
of the barons, agreed to their demand; and promised to
<PB N="187" REF="208">
&s;ummon another parliament at Oxford, in order to dige&s;t
the new plan of government, and to elect the per&s;ons,
who were to be entru&s;ted with the chief authority.</P>
<P>THIS parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">11 June.</NOTE> which the royali&s;ts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Provi&s;ions of Oxford.</NOTE> and even the
nation, from experience of the confu&s;ions that attended
its mea&s;ures, afterwards denominated the <HI>mad parliament,</HI>
met on the day appointed; and as all the barons brought
along with them their military va&s;&s;als, and appeared with
an armed force, the King, who had taken no precautions
again&s;t them, was in reality a pri&s;oner in their hands,
and was obliged to &s;ubmit to all the terms which they
were plea&s;ed to impo&s;e upon him. Twelve barons were
&s;elected fron the King's council; twelve more were
cho&s;en by parliament: To the&s;e twenty-four, unlimited
authority was granted of reforming the &s;tate; and the
King him&s;elf took an oath, that he would maintain
whatever ordinances they &s;hould think proper to enact for
that purpo&s;e<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 655. Chron. Dun&s;t. vol. i. p. 334. Knygh|ton, p. 2445.</NOTE>. Leice&s;ter was at the head of this &s;upreme
council, to which the legi&s;lative power was thus in reality
transferred; and all their mea&s;ures were taken by his
&s;ecret influence and direction. Their fir&s;t &s;tep bore a
&s;pecious appearance, and &s;eemed well calculated for the
end, which they profe&s;&s;ed to be the object of all the&s;e in|novations:
They ordered that four knights &s;hould be
cho&s;en by each county; that they &s;hould make enquiry
into the grievances of which their neighbourhood had
rea&s;on to complain, and &s;hould attend the next en&s;uing
parliament, in order to give information to that a&s;&s;embly
of the &s;tate of their particular counties<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 657. Addit. p. 140. Ann. Burt. p. 412.</NOTE>: A nearer ap|proach
to our pre&s;ent con&s;titution than had been made
by the barons in the reign of King John, when the
knights were only appointed to meet in their counties,
<PB N="188" REF="209">
and there to draw up a detail of their grievances. Mean
while, the twenty-four barons proceeded to enact &s;ome
regulations, in order to provide a redre&s;s for &s;uch griev|ances
as were &s;uppo&s;ed to be notorious to all the world.
They ordered, that three &s;e&s;&s;ions of parliament &s;hould be
regularly held every year, in the months of February,
June, and October; that a new high &s;heriff &s;hould be
elected every year by the votes of the freeholders in each
county<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Chron. Dun&s;t. vol. i. p. 336.</NOTE>; that the &s;heriffs &s;hould have no power of
fining the barons who did not attend at their courts, or
the circuits of the ju&s;ticiaries; that no heirs &s;hould be
committed to the ward&s;hip of foreigners, and no ca&s;tles
be entru&s;ted to their cu&s;tody; and that no new warrens
or fore&s;ts &s;hould be created, nor the revenues of any
counties or hundreds be let to farm. Such were the regulations
which the twenty-four barons enacted at Ox|ford,
for the redre&s;s of public grievances<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ann Burt. p. 413.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT the earl of Leice&s;ter and his a&s;&s;ociates, having advan|ced
&s;o far to &s;atisfy the nation, in&s;tead of continuing in this
popular cour&s;e, or granting the King that &s;upply which
they had promi&s;ed him, immediately made provi&s;ions for
the exten&s;ion and continuance of their own exorbitant authority.
They rouzed anew the popular clamour, which
had long prevailed again&s;t foreigners; and they fell with
the utmo&s;t violence on the King's half-brothers, who
were &s;uppo&s;ed to be the authors of all national grievan|ces,
and whom Henry had no longer any power to pro|tect.
The four brothers, &s;en&s;ible of their danger, took
to flight with an intention of making their e&s;cape out of
the kingdom; they were eagerly pur&s;ued by the barons;
Aymer, one of the brothers, who had been elected to
the &s;ee of Winche&s;ter, took &s;helter in his epi&s;copal pa|lace,
and carried the others along with him; they were
&s;urrounded in that place, and threatened to be dragged
<PB N="189" REF="210">
out by force, and to be puni&s;hed for their crimes and
mi&s;demeanors; and the King, pleading the &s;acredne&s;s
of an eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;anctuary, was glad to extricate them
from this danger by bani&s;hing them the kingdom<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 654. Ann. Burt. p. 411. Chron. T. Wykes, p. 53. W. Heming. p. 579. Chron. Dun&s;t. p. 335. M. We&s;t. p. 364. Ypod. Neu&s;t. p. 467. Knyghton, p. 2445.</NOTE>. In
this act of violence, as well as in the former u&s;urpations
of the barons, the queen and her uncles were thought to
have &s;ecretly concurred, being jealous of the credit, ac|quired
by the brothers, which, they imagined, had
eclip&s;ed and annihilated their own<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Ann. Waverl. p. 210.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT the &s;ub&s;equent proceedings of the twenty-four
barons were &s;ufficient to open the eyes of the whole king|dom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">U&s;urpations of the ba|rons.</NOTE> and to prove their intention of reducing for ever
both the King and the people under the arbitrary power
of a very narrow ari&s;tocracy, which mu&s;t at la&s;t have
terminated either in anarchy, or in a violent u&s;urpation
and tyranny. They pretended, that they had not as yet
dige&s;ted all the regulations nece&s;&s;ary for the reformation
of the &s;tate, and for the redre&s;s of grievances; and that
they mu&s;t &s;till retain their power, till that great purpo&s;e
was thoroughly effectuated: In other words, that they
mu&s;t be perpetual governors, and mu&s;t continue to re|form,
till they were plea&s;ed to demit their authority.
They formed an a&s;&s;ociation among them&s;elves, and &s;wore
that they would &s;tand by each other with their lives and
fortunes: They di&s;placed all the chief officers of the
crown, the high ju&s;ticiary, the chancellor, the trea|surer;
and advanced either them&s;elves or their own
creatures in their &s;tead: Even the offices of the King's
hou&s;hold were di&s;po&s;ed of at their plea&s;ure: The gover|nment
of all the ca&s;tles was put into hands in whom they
$ound rea&s;on to confide: And the whole power of the

&s;tate being thus transferred to them, they ventured to
impo&s;e an oath on every individual of the nation; in
which the &s;ubjects were obliged to &s;wear, under the pe|nalty
of being declared public enemies, that they would
obey and execute all the regulations, both known and
unknown, of the twenty-four barons: And all this, for
the greater glory of God, the honour of the church, the
&s;ervice of the King, and the advantage of the kingdom<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Chron. T. Wykes, p. 52.</NOTE>. No one dared to with&s;tand this tyrannical authority:
Prince Edward him&s;elf, the King's elde&s;t &s;on, a youth
of eighteen years of age, who began to give indications
of that great and manly &s;pirit, which appeared through|out
the whole cour&s;e of his life, was, after making some
oppo&s;ition, con&s;trained to take that oath, which really
depo&s;ed him and his family from &s;overeign authority<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ann. Burt. p. 411.</NOTE>.
Earl Warrenne was the la&s;t per&s;on in the kingdom, who could be brought to give the confederated barons this mark of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>BUT the twenty-four barons, not content with the
u&s;urpation of the royal power, introduced an innovation
in the con&s;titution of parliament, which was of the ut|mo&s;t
importance. They ordained, that that a&s;&s;embly
&s;hould choo&s;e a committee of twelve per&s;ons, who &s;hould,
in the intervals of the &s;e&s;&s;ions, po&s;&s;e&s;s the authority of the
whole parliament, and &s;hould attend on a &s;ummons the
per&s;on of the King, in all his motions. But &s;o power|ful
were the&s;e barons, that this regulation was al&s;o &s;ub|mitted
to; the whole government was overthrown or
fixed on new foundations; and the monarchy was total|ly
&s;ubverted, without it being po&s;&s;ible for the King to
&s;trike a &s;ingle &s;troke in defence of the con&s;titution again&s;t
the newly erected oligarchy.</P>
<P>THE report that the King of the Romans intended to
pay a vi&s;it to England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1259.</NOTE> gave alarm to the ruling barons;
<PB N="191" REF="214">
and they dreaded le&s;t the exten&s;ive influence and e&s;tabli&s;h|ed
authority of that prince would be employed to re&s;tore
the prerogatives of his family, and overturn their new
plan of government<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 661.</NOTE>. They &s;ent over the new bi&s;hop
of Worce&s;ter, who met him at St. Omars; a&s;ked him
in the name of the barons, the rea&s;on of his journey,
and how long he intended to &s;tay in England; and in&s;i&s;t|ed,
that before he entered the kingdom, he &s;hould &s;wear
to ob&s;erve the regulations e&s;tabli&s;hed at Oxford. On
Richard's refu&s;al to take this oath, they prepared to re&s;i&s;t
him as a public enemy; they fitted out a fleet, a&s;&s;embled
an army, and exciting the inveterate prejudices of the
people again&s;t foreigners, from whom they had &s;uffered
&s;o many oppre&s;&s;ions, &s;pread the report that Richard in|tended
to re&s;tore by force the authority of his exiled bro|thers,
and to violate all the &s;ecurities provided for public
liberty. The King of the Romans was at la&s;t obliged to
&s;ubmit to the terms required of him<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 661, 662. Chron. T. Wykes, p. 53.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT the barons, in proportion to their continuance
in power, began gradually to lo&s;e that popularity, which
had a&s;&s;i&s;ted them in obtaining it; and men repined that
regulations, which were only e&s;tabli&s;hed during a time
for the reformation of the &s;tate, were likely to become
perpetual, and to &s;ubvert entirely the antient con&s;titu|tion.
They dreaded, that the power of the nobles, which
was always oppre&s;&s;ive, would now exert it&s;elf without
controul, by removing the counterpoi&s;e of the crown;
and their apprehen&s;ions were encrea&s;ed by &s;ome new
edicts of the barons, which were plainly calculated to
procure to them&s;elves an impunity in all their violences.
They appointed, that the circuits of the itinerant ju&s;|tices,
the &s;ole check on their arbitrary conduct, &s;hould
be held only once in &s;even years; and men ea&s;ily &s;aw,
<PB N="192" REF="215">
that a remedy, which returned after &s;uch long intervals,
again&s;t an oppre&s;&s;ive power, which was perpetual, would
prove totally in&s;ignificant and u&s;ele&s;s<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 667. Trivet, p. 209.</NOTE>. The cry became
loud in the nation, that the barons &s;hould fini&s;h their
intended regulations. The knights of the &s;hires, who
&s;eem now to have been pretty regularly a&s;&s;embled in a
&s;eparate hou&s;e, made remon&s;trances again&s;t the &s;lowne&s;s
of their proceedings; they repre&s;ented, that, though
the King had performed all the conditions required of
him, the barons had hitherto done nothing for the pub|lic
good, and had been only careful to promote their own
private advantage, and to commit injury on the crown;
and they even appealed to prince Edward, and claimed
his interpo&s;al for the intere&s;ts of the nation, and the re|formation
of the government<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Annal. Burt. p. 427.</NOTE>. The prince replied, that
though it was from con&s;traint, and contrary to his pri|vate
&s;entiments, he had &s;worn to adhere to the provi&s;ions
of Oxford, he was determined to ob&s;erve his oath: But
he &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the barons, requiring them to bring
their undertaking to a &s;peedy conclu&s;ion, and fulfil
their engagements to the public: Otherwi&s;e, he menaced
them, that, at the expence of his life, he would oblige
them to do their duty, and would &s;hed the la&s;t drop of
his blood in promoting the intere&s;ts, and &s;atisfying the
ju&s;t wi&s;hes of the nation<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Annal. Burt. p. 427.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE barons, urged by &s;o pre&s;&s;ing a nece&s;&s;ity, publi&s;h|ed
at la&s;t a new code of ordinances for the reformation
of the &s;tate<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Annal. Burt. p. 428, 439.</NOTE>: But the expectations of the people were
extremely di&s;appointed, when they found, that the&s;e
con&s;i&s;ted only of &s;ome trivial alterations on the municipal
law; and &s;till more &s;o, when the barons pretended, that
the ta&s;k was not yet fini&s;hed, and that they mu&s;t farther
prolong their authority, in order to bring the work of
<PB N="193" REF="216">
reformation to the de&s;ired period. The current of popu|larity
was now much turned to the &s;ide of the crown;
and the barons had little more to rely on for their &s;up|port,
be&s;ides the private influence and power of their fa|milies,
which, though exorbitant, was likely to prove
inferior to the combination of King and people. Even
this ba&s;is of power was daily weakened by their inte&s;tine
jealou&s;ies and animo&s;ities; their antient and inveterate
quarrels broke out when they came to divide the &s;poils of
the crown; and the rival&s;hip between the earls of Lei|ce&s;ter
and Gloce&s;ter, the chief leaders among them, be|gan
to disjoint the whole confederacy. The latter, more
moderate in his preten&s;ions, was de&s;irous of &s;topping or
retarding the career of the barons' u&s;urpations; but the
former, enraged at the oppo&s;ition which he met with in
his own party, pretended to throw up all concern in
Engli&s;h affairs; and he retired into France<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Chron. Dun&s;t. vol. i. p. 348.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE kingdom of France, the only &s;tate with which
England had any con&s;iderable intercour&s;e, was at this
time governed by Lewis IX. a prince of the mo&s;t &s;ingu|lar
character, which is to be met with in all the records
of hi&s;tory. This monarch united to the mean and abject
&s;uper&s;tition of a monk, all the courage and magnanimity
of the greate&s;t hero; and, what may be deemed more
extraordinary, the ju&s;tice and integrity of the mo&s;t di&s;in|tere&s;ted
patriot, the mildne&s;s and humanity of the mo&s;t
accompli&s;hed philo&s;opher. So far from taking advantage
of the divi&s;ions of the Engli&s;h, or attempting to expel
tho&s;e dangerous rivals from the provinces, which they
&s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in France; he had entertained many &s;cru|ples
with regard to the forfeiture pronounced again&s;t the
King's father, had even expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome intention of re|&s;toring
the other provinces, and he was only prevented
from taking that imprudent re&s;olution, by the united re|mon&s;trances
<PB N="194" REF="217">
of his own barons, who repre&s;ented the
extreme danger of &s;uch a mea&s;ure<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p 604.</NOTE>, and, what had a
greater influence on Lewis, the ju&s;tice of puni&s;hing by a
legal &s;entence the barbarity and felony of John. Where|ever
this prince interpo&s;ed in Engli&s;h affairs, it was al|ways
with an intention of compo&s;ing the differences be|tween
the King and his nobility; he recommended to
both parties every peaceable and reconciling mea&s;ure;
and he u&s;ed all his authority with the earl of Leice&s;ter,
his native &s;ubject, to bend him to a compliance with
Henry.<NOTE PLACE="marg">20 May.</NOTE> He made a treaty with England, at a time,
when the di&s;tractions of that kingdom were at the great|e&s;t
height, and when the King's authority was totally
annihilated; and the terms, which he granted, might,
even in a more pro&s;perous &s;tate of their affairs, be deem|ed
rea&s;onable and advantageous by the Engli&s;h. He
yielded up &s;ome territories which had been conquered
from Poictou and Guienne; he en&s;ured the peaceable
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the latter province to Henry; he agreed to
pay that prince a large &s;um of money; and he only
required that the King &s;hould, in return, make a final
ce&s;&s;ion to France of Normandy, and the other provinces,
which he could never entertain any hopes of recovering
by force of arms<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 675. M. Paris, p. 566. Chron. T. Wykes, p. 53. Trivet, p. 208. M. We&s;t. p. 371.</NOTE>. This ce&s;&s;ion was ratified by Henry,
by his two &s;ons, and two daughters, and by the King
of the Romans and his three &s;ons: Leice&s;ter alone, either
moved by a vain arrogance, or de&s;irous to ingratiate
him&s;elf with the Engli&s;h populace, prote&s;ted again&s;t the
deed, and in&s;i&s;ted on the right, however di&s;tant, which
might accrue to his counte&s;s<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Chron. T. Wykes, p. 53.</NOTE>. Lewis &s;aw in this ob&s;ti|nacy
the unbounded ambition of the man; and as the
barons in&s;i&s;ted, that the money which was due by treaty,
<PB N="195" REF="218">
&s;hould be at their di&s;po&s;al, not at Henry's, he al&s;o &s;aw,
and probably with regret, the low condition to which
this monarch, who had more erred from weakne&s;s than
malice, was reduced by the turbulency of his own &s;ub|jects.</P>
<P>BUT the &s;ituation of Henry changed &s;oon after much
to his advantage.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1261.</NOTE> The twenty-four barons had now en|joyed
the &s;overeign power near three years; and had vi|&s;ibly
employed it, not for the reformation of the &s;tate,
which was their fir&s;t pretence, but for the aggrandize|ment
of them&s;elves and of their families. The breach of
tru&s;t was apparent to all the world: Every order of men
felt and murmured again&s;t it: The di&s;&s;entions among
the barons them&s;elves, which encrea&s;ed the evil, made
al&s;o the remedy more obvious and ea&s;y; And the &s;ecret
de&s;ertion in particular of the earl of Gloce&s;ter to the
crown, &s;eemed to promi&s;e Henry certain &s;ucce&s;s in any
attempt to re&s;ume his authority. Yet dared he not to
take that &s;tep, &s;o reconcilable both to ju&s;tice and policy,
without making a previous application to Rome, and
obtaining an ab&s;olution from his oaths and engagements.</P>
<P>THE Pope was at that time very much di&s;&s;atisfied with
the conduct of the barons; who, in order to gain the favour
of the people and clergy of England, had expelled all the
Italian eccle&s;ia&s;tics, had confi&s;cated their benefices, and
&s;eemed determined to maintain the liberties and privileges
of the Engli&s;h church, in which the rights of patronage,
belonging to their own families, were al&s;o included.
The extreme animo&s;ity of the Engli&s;h clergy again&s;t the
Italians, was al&s;o a &s;ource of his di&s;gu&s;t to this order;
and an attempt which had been made by them for farther
liberty and independance on the civil power, was there|fore
le&s;s acceptable to the court of Rome. About the
&s;ame time, that the barons at Oxford had annihilated
<PB N="196" REF="219">
the prerogatives of the monarchy, the clergy met in a
&s;ynod at Merton, and pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal decrees, which were
no le&s;s calculated to promote their own grandeur at the
expence of the crown. They decreed, that it was un|lawful
to try the eccle&s;ia&s;tics by &s;ecular judges; that the
clergy were not to regard any prohibitions from civil
courts; that lay patrons had no right to confer &s;piritual
benefices; that the magi&s;trate was obliged, without far|ther
enquiry, to impri&s;on all excommunicated per&s;ons;
and that antient u&s;age, without any particular grant of
charter, was a &s;ufficient authority for any clerical po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions
or privileges<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ann. Burt. p. 389.</NOTE>. About a century ago, the&s;e claims
would have been &s;anctified by the court of Rome beyond
the mo&s;t fundamental articles of faith: They were the
chief points maintained by the great martyr, Becket;
and his re&s;olution in defending them had exalted him to
the high &s;tation which he held in the catalogue of Romi&s;h
&s;aints: But principles were changed with the times:
The Pope was become &s;omewhat jealous of the great in|dependence
of the Engli&s;h church, which made them
&s;tand le&s;s in need of his protection, and even emboldened
them to re&s;i&s;t his authority, and complain of the prefer|ence
given to the Italian courtiers, who&s;e intere&s;ts, it is
natural to imagine, were the chief object of his concern.
He was very ready, therefore, on the King's application,
to annul the&s;e new con&s;titutions of the church of Eng|land<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 755.</NOTE>.
And at the &s;ame time, he ab&s;olved the King
and all his &s;ubjects from the oath, which they had taken
to ob&s;erve the provi&s;ions of Oxford<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 722. M. Paris, p. 666. W. Heming. p. 580. Ypod. Neu&s;t. p. 468. Knyghton, p. 2446.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>PRINCE Edward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince Ed|ward.</NOTE> who&s;e enlarged thoughts, though
in &s;uch early youth, had taught him the great prejudice,
which his father had incurred, by his levity, incon&s;tan|cy
<PB N="197" REF="220">
and frequent breach of promi&s;e, refu&s;ed for a long
time to take advantage of this ab&s;olution; and declared
that the provi&s;ions of Oxford, however unrea&s;onable in
them&s;elves, and however abu&s;ed by the barons, ought
&s;till to be adhered to by tho&s;e who had &s;worn to ob&s;erve
them<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 667.</NOTE>: He him&s;elf had been con&s;trained by violence to
take that oath; yet was he determined to keep it. By
this &s;crupulous fidelity, the prince acquired the confidence
of all parties, and was afterwards enabled to recover
fully the royal authority, and to perform &s;uch great ac|tions
both during his own reign and that of his father.</P>
<P>THE &s;ituation of England, during this period, as well
as that of mo&s;t European kingdoms, was &s;omewhat pe|culiar.
There was no regular military force maintained
in the nation: The &s;word, however, was not, properly
&s;peaking, in the hands of the people: The barons were
entru&s;ted entirely with the defence of the community;
and after any effort, which they made, either again&s;t
their own prince, or again&s;t foreigners, as the military
retainers departed to their own home, the armies were
di&s;&s;olved, and could not &s;peedily be re-a&s;&s;embled at plea|&s;ure.
It was ea&s;y therefore, for a few barons, by a
combination, to get the &s;tart of the other party, to col|lect
&s;uddenly their troops, and to appear unexpectedly
in the field with an army, which their antagoni&s;ts, though
equal or even &s;uperior in power and intere&s;t, would not
dare to encounter. Hence the &s;udden revolutions, which
were ob&s;ervable in the&s;e governments: Hence the fre|quent
victories obtained without a blow by one faction
over another: And hence it happened, that the &s;eeming
prevalence of a party, was &s;eldom a progno&s;tic of its long
continuance in power and authority.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="221">
THE King, &s;o &s;oon as he received the Pope's ab&s;olu|tion

to the countenance of the church, to the &s;upport pro|mi&s;ed
him by many con&s;iderable barons, and to the re|turning

ma&s;k, and after ju&s;tifying his conduct: by a proclamation,
in which he &s;et forth the private ambition, and the breach
of tru&s;t, con&s;picuous in Leice&s;ter and his a&s;&s;ociates, de|clared
that he had re&s;umed the government, and was de|termined
thenceforth to exert the royal authority for the
protection of his &s;ubjects. He removed Hugh le De&s;|pen&s;er
and Nicholas de Ely, the high ju&s;ticiary and
chancellor appointed by the barons; and put Philip Ba&s;|&s;et
and Walter de Merton in their place. He &s;ub&s;tituted
new &s;heriffs in all the counties, men of character and
reputation: He placed new governors in mo&s;t of the
ca&s;tles: He changed all the officers of his hou&s;hold: He
&s;ummoned a parliament, in which the re&s;umption of his
authority was ratified, with only five di&s;&s;enting voices:
And the barons, after making one fruitle&s;s effort, to take
the King by &s;urprize at Winche&s;ter, were obliged to ac|quie&s;ce
in tho&s;e new regulations<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 668. Chron. T. Wykes, p. 55.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King, in order to cut off every objection to his
conduct, offered to refer all the differences between him
and the earl of Leice&s;ter, to Margaret queen of France<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 724.</NOTE>.
The celebrated integrity of Lewis gave a mighty influ|ence
to any deci&s;ion which i&s;&s;ued from his court; and
Henry probably hoped, that the gallantry, on which all
barons, as true knights, valued them&s;elves, would make
them a&s;hamed not to &s;ubmit to the award of that prin|ce&s;s,
Lewis entirely merited the confidence repo&s;ed in
him. By an admirable conduct, probably as political as
<PB N="199" REF="222">
ju&s;t, he continually interpo&s;ed his good offices to allay
the civil di&s;cords of the Engli&s;h: He forwarded all heal|ing
mea&s;ures, which might give &s;ecurity to both parties:
And he &s;till endeavoured, tho' in vain, to &s;ooth by per|&s;ua&s;ion
the fierce ambition of the earl of Leice&s;ter, and
to convince him how much it was his duty to &s;ubmit
peaceably to the authority of his &s;overeign.</P>

The death of Richard earl of Gloce&s;ter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Civil ware of the ba|rons.</NOTE> who was his
chief rival in power, and who, before his decea&s;e, had
joined the royal party, &s;eemed to open a new field to
his violence, and to expo&s;e the throne to fre&s;h in&s;ults
and injuries. It was in vain, that the King profe&s;&s;ed
his intentions of ob&s;erving &s;trictly the great charter,
even of maintaining all the regulations made by the re|forming
barons at Oxford or afterwards, except tho&s;e
which entirely annihilated the royal authority: The&s;e
powerful chieftains, now obnoxious to the court, could
not peaceably re&s;ign the hopes of entire independance
and uncontrouled power with which they had flattered
them&s;elves, and which they had &s;o long enjoyed. Many
of them engaged in Leice&s;ter's views, and among the
re&s;t, Gilbert, the young earl of Gloce&s;ter, who brought
him a mighty acce&s;&s;ion of power, from the exten&s;ive au|thority
po&s;&s;e&s;t by that opulent family. Even Henry, son
of the King of the Romans, commonly called Henry
d' Allmaine, tho' a prince of the blood, joined the party
of the barons again&s;t the King, the head of his own
family. Leice&s;ter him&s;elf, who &s;till re&s;ided in France,
formed &s;ecretly the links of this great con&s;piracy, and
planned the whole &s;cheme of operations.</P>

line, &s;till pre&s;erved authority in their own country
and tho' they had often been con&s;trained to pay tribute
to the crown of England, they were with difficulty retained
in &s;ubordination or even in peace; and almo&s;t
throughout every reign &s;ince the conque&s;t, had infe&s;ted
the Engli&s;h frontiers with &s;uch petty incur&s;ions and &s;ud|den
inroads, as &s;eldom merited to have place in a general
hi&s;tory. The Engli&s;h, &s;till contented with repelling
their inva&s;ions, and chacing them back into their barren
mountains, had never pur&s;ued the advantages obtained
again&s;t them, nor attempted, even under their greate&s;t
and mo&s;t active princes, a total, or &s;o much as a feudal
&s;ubjection of the country. This advantage was re&s;erved
to the pre&s;ent King, the weake&s;t and mo&s;t indolent. In
the year 1237, Lewellyn, prince of Wales, declining in
years and broke with infirmities, but &s;till more harra&s;&s;ed
with the rebellion and undutiful behaviour of his &s;on,
Griffin, had recour&s;e to the protection of Henry; and
con&s;enting to &s;ubject his principality, which had &s;o long
maintained its independance, to va&s;&s;alage under the
crown of England, purcha&s;ed &s;ecurity and tranquillity on
the&s;e di&s;honourable terms. His elde&s;t &s;on and heir,
David, renewed the homage to England; and having
taken his brother pri&s;oner, delivered him into Henry's
hands, who committed him to cu&s;tody in the Tower.
That prince, endeavouring to make his e&s;cape from con|finement,
lo&s;t his life in the attempt; and the prince of
Wales, freed from the apprehen&s;ions of &s;o dangerous a
rival, paid thenceforth le&s;s regard to the Engli&s;h mo|narch,
and even renewed tho&s;e incur&s;ions, by which the
Wel&s;h, during &s;o many ages, had been accu&s;tomed to
infe&s;t their borders. Lewellyn, however, the &s;on of
Griffin, who &s;ucceeded to his uncle, had been obliged
to renew the homage, which was now claimed by Eng|land
as an e&s;tabli&s;hed right; but he was well plea&s;ed to
inflame tho&s;e civil di&s;cords, on which he re&s;ted his pre|sent
<PB N="201" REF="224">
&s;ecurity, and founded his hopes of future independ|ance.
He entered into a confederacy with the earl of
Leice&s;ter, and collecting all the force of his principality,
invaded England with an army of 30,000 men. He ra|vaged
the lands of Roger de Mortimer and of all the
barons, who adhered to the crown<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Chron. Dun&s;t. vol. i. p. 354.</NOTE>; he marched into
Che&s;hire, and committed like depredations on prince
Edward's territories; every place, where his di&s;orderly
troops appeared, was laid wa&s;te with fire and &s;word; and
tho' Mortimer, a gallant and expert &s;oldier, made &s;tout
re&s;i&s;tance, it was found nece&s;&s;ary, that the prince him&s;elf
&s;hould head the army again&s;t this invader. Edward re|pul&s;ed
prince Lewellyn, and obliged him to take &s;helter
in the mountains of North Wales: But he was pre|vented
from making farther progre&s;s again&s;t the enemy,
by the di&s;orders, which &s;oon after broke out in England.</P>
<P>THE Wel&s;h inva&s;ion was the appointed &s;ignal for the
malecontent barons to ri&s;e in arms; and Leice&s;ter coming
over &s;ecretly from France, collected all the forces, of his
party, and commenced an open rebellion. He &s;eized the
per&s;on of the bi&s;hop of Hereford; a prelate very obnoxi|ous
to all the inferior clergy, on account of his devoted
attachment to the court of Rome<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. 211. M. We&s;t. p. 382. 392.</NOTE>. Simon, bi&s;hop of
Norwich, and John Man&s;el, becau&s;e they had publi&s;hed
the Pope's bull, ab&s;olving the King and kingdom from
their oaths to ob&s;erve the provi&s;ions of Oxford, were
made pri&s;oners, and expo&s;ed to the utmo&s;t rage of the
party. The King's deme&s;nes were ravaged with un|bounded
fury<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. 211. M, We&s;t. p. 382.</NOTE>; and as it was Leice&s;ter's intere&s;t to al|lure
to his &s;ide, by the hopes of plunder, all the di&s;or|derly
ruffians in England, he gave them a general licence
to pillage the barons of the oppo&s;ite party, and even all
neutral per&s;ons. But one of the principal re&s;ources of
<PB N="202" REF="225">
his faction was the populace of the cities, particularly of
London; and as he had, by his hypocritical preten&s;ions
to &s;anctity, and his zeal again&s;t Rome, engaged all the
monks and lower eccle&s;ia&s;tics in his party, his dominion
over the inferior ranks of men became ab&s;olutely uncon|trolable.
Thomas Fitz-Richard, the mayor of London,
a furious and licentious man, gave the countenance of

war again&s;t the &s;ub&s;tantial citizens, he loo&s;ened
all the bands of government, by which that turbulent
city was commonly but ill re&s;trained. On the approach
of Ea&s;ter, the zeal of &s;uper&s;tition, the appetite for
plunder, or what is often as prevalent with the populace
as either of the&s;e motives, the plea&s;ure of committing
havock and de&s;truction, prompted them to attack the un|happy
Jews, who were fir&s;t pillaged without re&s;i&s;tance,
and then ma&s;&s;acred, to the number of five hundred per|&s;ons<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Chron. T. Wykes, p. 59.</NOTE>.
The Lombard bankers were next expo&s;ed to the
rage of the people; and tho', by taking &s;anctuary in
the churches, they e&s;caped with their lives, all their
money and goods became a prey to the licentious mul|titude.
Even the hou&s;es of the rich citizens, tho' Eng|li&s;h,
were attacked by night; and way was made by
&s;word and by fire to the pillage of their goods, and often
to the de&s;truction of their per&s;ons. The queen, who,
tho' &s;he was defended by the Tower, was terrified by
the neighbourhood of &s;uch dangerous commotions, re|&s;olved
to go by water to the ca&s;tle of Wind&s;or; but as

<P>THE violence and fury of Leice&s;ter's faction had ri&s;en
to &s;uch a height in all parts of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">18th July.</NOTE> that the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">14th Oct.</NOTE>
unable to re&s;i&s;t their power, was obliged to &s;et on foot
a treaty of peace; and to make an accommodation with
the barons on the mo&s;t di&s;advahtageous terms<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Chron. Dun&s;t. vol. i. p. 358. Trivet, p. 211.</NOTE>. He agreed to confirm anew the provi&s;ions of Oxford, even
tho&s;e which entirely annihilated the royal authority; and
the barons were again re-in&s;tated in the &s;overeignty of
the kingdom. They re&s;tored Hugh le De&s;pen&s;er to the
office of high ju&s;ticiary; they appointed their own crea|tures
&s;heriffs in every county of England; they took
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the royal ca&s;tles and fortre&s;&s;es; they
even named all the officers of the King's hou&s;hold; and
they &s;ummoned a parliament to meet at We&s;tmin&s;ter, in
order to &s;ettle more fully their, plan of government.
They here produced a new li&s;t of twenty four barons, to
whom they propo&s;ed, that the administration &s;hould be
entirely committed; and they in&s;i&s;ted, that the authority
of this junto &s;hould continue, not only during the reign
of the King, but al&s;o during that of prince Edward.</P>
<P>THIS prince, who was the life and &s;oul of the royal
party, had unhappily, before the King's accommodation
with the barons, been taken pri&s;oner by Leice&s;ter in a
parley at Wind&s;or<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 669. Trivet, p. 213.</NOTE>; and this misfortune, more than
any other incident, had determined Henry to &s;ubmit to
the ignominious conditions impo&s;ed upon him. But
having recovered his liberty by the treaty, Edward em|ployed
his activity in defence of the prerogatives of his
family; and he gained a large party even among tho&s;e
who had at fir&s;t adhered with the greate&s;t zeal to the
cau&s;e of the barons. His cou&s;in, Henry d'Allmaine,

Robert de Brus, Roger de Leyborne, with almo&s;t all

kingdom, declared in favour of the royal cau&s;e; and
ho&s;tilities, which were &s;carce well compo&s;ed, were again
renewed in every part of England. But the near balance
of the parties, joined to the univer&s;al clamour of the
people, obliged the King and barons to open anew the
negotiations for peace; and it was agreed by both &s;ides,
to &s;ubmit the differences entirely to the arbitration of
the King of France<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 668. Chron. T. WyKes, p. 58. W. Heming. p. 580. Chron. Du$st. vol. i p. 563.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS virtuous prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reference to the King France.</NOTE> the only man, who, in like
circum&s;tances, could &s;afely have been intru&s;ted with &s;uch
an authority by a neighbouring nation, had never cea&s;ed
to interpo&s;e his good offices between the Engli&s;h factions;
and had even, during the &s;hort interval of peace, invited
over to Paris both the King and the earl of Leice&s;ter, in
order to accommodate the differences between them;
but found, that the fears and animo&s;ities on both &s;ides,
as well as the ambition of Leice&s;ter, were &s;o violent, as
to render all his endeavours ineffectual. But when this
&s;olemn appeal, ratified by the oaths and &s;ub&s;criptions of
the leaders in each faction, was made to his judgment,
he was not di&s;couraged from pur&s;uing his honourable pur|po&s;e:
He &s;ummoned the &s;tates of France at Amiens;
and there, in the pre&s;ence of that a&s;&s;embly, as well as in
that of the King of England and Peter de Montfort,
Leice&s;ter's &s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1264</NOTE> he brought this great cau&s;e to a trial and
examination. It appeared to him, that the provi&s;ions of
Oxford, even had they not been extorted by force, had
<PB N="205" REF="228">
they not been &s;o exorbitant in their nature and &s;ubver|&s;ive
of the antient con&s;titution, were expre&s;sly e&s;tabli&s;hed
as a temporary expedient, and could not,<NOTE PLACE="marg">23d Jan.</NOTE> without breach
of tru&s;t, be rendered perpetual by the barons. He there|fore
annulled the&s;e provi&s;ions; re&s;tored to the King the
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his ca&s;tles, and the power of nomination to
the great offices; allowed him to retain what foreigners
he plea&s;ed in his kingdom, and even to confer on them
places of tru&s;t and dignity; and in a word, re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
the royal power on the &s;ame, footing, on which
it &s;tood before the meeting of the famous parliament at
Oxford. But while he thus &s;uppre&s;&s;ed dangerous inno|vations,
and pre&s;erved unimpaired the prerogatives of the
Engli&s;h crown, he was not negligent of the rights of
the people; and be&s;ides ordering that a general amne&s;ty
&s;hould be granted for all pa&s;t offences, he declared that
his award was not any wi&s;e meant to derogate from the
privileges and liberties, which the nation enjoyed by any
former conce&s;&s;ions or charters of the crown<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 776, 777, &amp;c. Chron. T. Wykes, p. 58. Knyghton, p. 2446.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS equitable &s;entence was no &s;ooner known in Eng|land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Renewal of the civil wars.</NOTE>
than Leice&s;ter and his confederates determined to
reject it, and to have recour&s;e to arms, in order to pro|cure
to them&s;elves more &s;afe and, advantageous conditions
from the King<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Chron. Dun&s;t. vol. i. p. 363.</NOTE>. Without regard to his oaths and &s;ub|&s;criptions,
that enterprizing con&s;pirator ordered his two
&s;ons, Richard and Peter de Montfort, in conjunction
with Robert de Ferrars, earl of Derby, to attack the
city of Worce&s;ter; while Henry and Simon de Mont|fort,
two others of his &s;ons, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the prince of
Wales, were ordered to commit ravages on the e&s;tate of
Roger de Mortimer. He him&s;elf re&s;ided at London;
and employing as his in&s;trument, Fitz-Richard, the &s;e|ditious
mayor, who had violently and illegally prolonged
<PB N="206" REF="229">
his authority, he wrought up that city to the highe&s;t fer|ment
and agitation. The populace formed them&s;elves
into bands and companies; cho&s;e leaders; practi&s;ed all
military exerci&s;es; committed violence on all the roya|li&s;ts:
And to give them greater countenance in their di&s;|orders,
an a&s;&s;ociation was entered into between the city
and eighteen great barons, never to make peace with
the King but by common con&s;ent and approbation.
At the head of tho&s;e who &s;wore to maintain this a&s;&s;o|ciation,
were the earls of Leice&s;ter, Gloce&s;ter and Derby,
with le De&s;pen&s;er, the chief ju&s;ticiary; men who had all
previou&s;ly &s;worn to &s;ubmit to the award of the French
monarch. Their only pretence for this breach of faith,
was, that the latter part of Lewis's &s;entence was, as they
affirmed, a contradiction to the former: He ratified the
charter of liberties, yet annulled the provisions of Ox|ford;
which were only calculated, as they maintained,
to pre&s;erve that charter; and without which, in their
e&s;timation, they had no &s;ecurity for its ob&s;ervance.</P>
<P>THE King and prince, finding a civil war inevitable,
prepared them&s;elves for defence; and &s;ummoning the
military va&s;&s;als from all quarters, and being re-inforced
by Baliol, lord of Galloway, Brus lord of Annandale,
Henry Piercy, John Comyn<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 771. M. We&s;t. p. 385. Ypod. Neu&s;t. p. 469.</NOTE>, and other barons of the
north, they compo&s;ed an army, formidable as well from
its numbers, as its military prowe&s;s and experience.
The fir&s;t enterprize of the royali&s;ts was the attack of
Northampton; which was defended by Simon de Mont|fort,
with many of the principal barons of that party:
AND a breach being rnade in the walls by Philip Ba&s;&s;et,<NOTE PLACE="marg">5th April.</NOTE>
the place was carried by a&s;&s;ault, and both the governor
and the garri&s;on were made pri&s;oners of war<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Chron. T. Wykes, p. 60. W. Heming. p. 581. Chron. Dun&s;t. p. 367. M. We&s;t. p. 385.</NOTE>. The

royali&s;ts marched thence to Leice&s;ter and Nottingham,
both which places opened their gates to them<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Chron. T. Wykes, p. 60. Knyghton, p. 2447.</NOTE>; and
prince Edward proceeded with a detachment into the
county of Derby, in order to ravage with fire and &s;word
the lands of the earl of that name, and take revenge on
him for his di&s;loyalty<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">M. We&s;t. p. 385.</NOTE>. Like maxims of war prevailed
with both parties throughout England; and the kin|gdom
was thus expo&s;ed in a moment to greater deva&s;tation,
from the animo&s;ities of the rival barons, than it would
have &s;uffered from many years of foreign or even dome&s;tic
ho&s;tilities, conducted by more humane and more generous
principles.</P>
<P>THE earl of Leice&s;ter, matter of London, and of the
counties in the &s;outh ea&s;t of England, formed the &s;iege
of Roche&s;ter<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 669. Chron. T. Wykes, p. 61.</NOTE>, which alone held for the king in tho&s;e
parts, and which, be&s;ides earl Warrenne, the governor,
was garri&s;oned by many noble and powerful barons of
the royal party. The King and prince ha&s;tened from
Nottingham, where they were then quartered, to the
relief of the place; and on their approach, Leice&s;ter rai&s;ed
the &s;iege and retreated to London, which, being the
center of his power, he was afraid, might, in his ab&s;ence,
fall into the King's hands, either by force, or by a cor|re&s;pondence
with the principal inhabitants, who were
all of them &s;ecretly inclined to the royal cau&s;e<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">W. Heming. p. 582. Chron. Dun&s;t. vol. i. p. 369.</NOTE>. Re-in|forced
by a body of 15000 citizens, and having &s;ummon|ed
his partizans from all quarters, he thought him&s;elf
&s;trong enough to hazard a general battle with the
royali&s;ts, and to determine the fate of the nation in one
great engagement; which if it proved &s;ucce&s;sful, mu&s;t
<PB N="208" REF="231">
be deci&s;ive again&s;t the king, who had no retreat to his
broken troops in tho&s;e parts; while Leice&s;ter him&s;elf, in
ca&s;e of any &s;ini&s;ter accident, could ea&s;ily take shelter in
the city. To give the better colouring to his cau&s;e, he
previou&s;ly &s;ent a me&s;&s;age with conditions of peace to
Henry, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive in the language, but exorbitant in the
demands<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 669. W. Heming. p. 583.</NOTE>; and when the me&s;&s;enger returned with the lye
and defiance from the King, the prince, and the King
of the Romans, he &s;ent a new me&s;&s;age, renouncing, in
the name of him&s;elf and of the a&s;&s;ociated barons, all fealty
and allegiance to Henry. He then marched out of the
city with his army, divided into four bodies: The fir&s;t com|manded
by his two &s;ons, Henry and Guy de Montfort,
with Humphrey de Bohun, earl of Hereford, who had
de&s;erted to the barons; the &s;econd led by the earl of
Gloce&s;ter, with William de Montche&s;ney and John
Fitz John; the third, compo&s;ed of Londoners, under
the command of Nicholas de Segrave; the fourth head|ed
by him&s;elf in per&s;on. The bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter gave
a general ab&s;olution to the army, accompanied with a&s;&s;u|rances,
that, if any of them fell in the action, they would
infallibly be received into heaven, as the reward of their
&s;ufferings in &s;o meritorious a cau&s;e!</P>
<P>LEICESTER,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Lewes. 14th May.</NOTE> who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great talents for war, con|ducted
his march with &s;uch &s;kill and &s;ecrecy, that he

at Lewes in Su&s;&s;ex: But the promptitude of prince Ed|ward
foon repaired this negligence; and he led out the
King's army to the field in three bodies. He him&s;elf
conducted the van, attended by earl Warrenne and Wil|liam

the King of the Romans and his &s;on Henry: The King

<P>PRINCE Edward, returning to the field of battle from
his precipitate pur&s;uit of the Londoners, was a&s;toni&s;hed

&s;till more to hear that his father and uncle were defeated
and taken pri&s;oners, and that Arundel, Comyn, Brus,
Hamoh $'E&s;trange, Roger Leybourne, and all the con|&s;iderable

victorious enemy. Earl Warrenne, Hugh Bigod, and
William de Valence, &s;truck with de&s;pair at this event,
<PB N="210" REF="233">
immediately took to flight, hurried to Pevencey, and
made their e&s;cape beyond &s;ea<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Chron. T. Wykes, p. 63.</NOTE>: But the prince, intrepid
amid&s;t the greate&s;t di&s;a&s;ters, exhorted his troops to re|venge

and to &s;natch an ea&s;y conque&s;t from an enemy,
di&s;ordered by their own victory<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">W. Heming. p. 584.</NOTE>. He found his follow|ers
intimidated by their &s;ituation, while Leice&s;ter, afraid
of a &s;udden and violent blow from the prince, amu&s;ed
him by a pretence of negotiation, till he was able to re|call
his troops from the pur&s;uit, and to bring them into
order<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. There now appeared no farther re&s;ource to the

of their &s;overeign, as well as of all their principal

to Leice&s;ter's terms, which were &s;hort and &s;evere, agree|able

&s;tipulated, that he and Henry d'Allmain &s;hould &s;urren|der

be relea&s;ed<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 671. Knyghton, p. 2451.</NOTE>; and that in order to &s;ettle fully the terms
of agreement, applications &s;hould be made to the King
of France, that he &s;hould name &s;ix Frenchmen, three
prelates and three noblemen: The&s;e &s;ix to choo&s;e two
others of their own country: And the&s;e two to choo&s;e
one Engli&s;hman, who, in conjunction with them&s;elves,
were to be inve&s;ted by both parties with full powers to
make what regulations they thought proper for the &s;ettle|ment
of the kingdom. The prince and young Henry
accordingly delivered them&s;elves into Leice&s;ter's hands,
who &s;ent them under a guard to Dover ca&s;tle. Such

the crown and of the hou&s;ehold were named by him; and
the whole authority, as well as arms of the &s;tate, was

a monopoly of all the wool of the kingdom, the only va|luable

that power which he had acquired by &s;o much vio|lence,
and which he u&s;ed with &s;o much tyranny and
inju&s;tice. An ordinance was there pa&s;&s;ed, to which the
King's con&s;ent had been previously extorted, that every
act of royal power &s;hould be exerci&s;ed by a council of
nine per&s;ons, who were to be cho&s;en and removed by
the majority of three, Leice&s;ter him&s;elf, the earl of Glo|ce&s;ter,
and the bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 793. Brady's App. N&deg;. 213.</NOTE>. By this intricate
plan of government, the &s;cepter was really put into Lei|ce&s;ter's
hands; as he had the entire direction of the bi|&s;hop
of Chiche&s;ter, and thereby commanded all the re&s;o|lutions
of the council of three, who could appoint or di&s;|card
at plea&s;ure every member of the &s;upreme council.</P>
<P>BUT it was impo&s;&s;ible that things could long remain
in this &s;trange &s;ituation. It behoved Leice&s;ter either to
de&s;cend with &s;ome danger into the rank of a &s;ubject, or
to mount up with no le&s;s into that of a &s;overeign; and
his exorbitant ambition, unre&s;trained by any fear or prin|ciple,
gave too much rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect him of the latter
intention. Mean while, he was expo&s;ed to anxiety from
every quarter; and felt that the &s;malle&s;t incident was ca|pable
of overturning that immen&s;e and ill-cemented fabric,
which he had reared. The Queen, whom her hu&s;band had
left abroad, had collected in foreign parts an army of de&s;|perate
adventurers, and had a&s;&s;embled a great number of
&s;hips, with a view of invading the kingdom, and of bringing
relief to her unfortunate family. Lewis, dete&s;ting Lei|ce&s;ter's
u&s;urpations and perjuries, and di&s;gu&s;ted by the
refu&s;al of the Engli&s;h barons, to &s;ubmit to his award,
favoured all her enterprizes, and was generally believed
to be making preparations for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. An
Engli&s;h army, by the pretended authority of the captive
King, was a&s;&s;embled on the &s;ea coa&s;t to oppo&s;e this pro|jected

to cro&s;s winds, which long detained and at la&s;t di&s;&s;ipated
and broke the Queen's fleet, than to any re&s;i&s;tance,

<P>LEICESTER found him&s;elf better able to re&s;i&s;t the &s;pi|ritual
thunders, which were levelled again&s;t him. The
Pope, &s;till adhering to the King's cau&s;e again&s;t the
barons, di&s;patched cardinal Guido as his legate into Eng|land,
with orders to excommunicate the three earls, Lei|ce&s;ter,
Gloce&s;ter, and Norfolk, by name, and all others in
general, who concurred in the oppre&s;&s;ion and captivity of
their &s;overeign<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 798. Chron. Dun&s;t. vol. i. p 373.</NOTE>. Leice&s;ter menaced the legate with
death, if he &s;et his foot within the kingdom; but Guido,
meeting in France the bi&s;hops of Winche&s;ter, London,
and Worce&s;ter, who had been &s;ent thither on a negotia|tion,
commanded them, under the penalty of eccle&s;ia&s;|tical
cen&s;ures, to carry his bull into England, and to pub|li&s;h
it again&s;t the barons. When the prelates arrived off
the coa&s;t, they were boarded by the pyratical mariners
of the cinque ports, to whom probably they gave a hint
of the cargo, which they brought along with them: The
bull was torn and thrown into the &s;ea; which furni&s;hed
the artful prelates with a plau&s;ible excu&s;e for not obey|ing
the orders of the legate<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 671. T. Wykes, p. 65.</NOTE>. Leice&s;ter appealed from
Guido to the Pope in per&s;on; but before his amba&s;&s;adors
could reach Rome to defend his cau&s;e, the Pope was
dead, and they found the legate him&s;elf, from whom
they had appealed, &s;eated on the papal throne, under the
name of Urban IV. That daring leader was no wi&s;e
di&s;mayed with this event; and as he found that a great
<PB N="215" REF="238">
part of his popularity in England was founded on his
oppo&s;ition to Rome, which was now become odious, he
per&s;i&s;ted with the more ob&s;tinacy in the pro&s;ecution of
his mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>THAT he might both encrea&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1265.</NOTE> and turn to advantage
his popularity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">20th Janu|ary.</NOTE> Leice&s;ter &s;ummoned a new parliament in
London, where he knew his power was uncontrolable;
and he fixed this a&s;&s;embly on a more democratical ba&s;is,
than any which had ever been &s;ummoned &s;ince the foun|dation
of the Engli&s;h monarchy. Be&s;ides the barons of
his own party, and &s;everal eccle&s;ia&s;tics, who were not
immediate tenants of the crown; he ordered returns to
be made of two knights from every &s;hire, and what is
more remarkable, of deputies from the boroughs, which
had always in former ages been e&s;teemed of too mean a
rank to be allowed a place in the national councils<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 802. Fitz-Stephen, Hi&s;t, Quadrip. Hoveden, &amp;c.</NOTE>.
This period is commonly e&s;teemed the epoch of the hou&s;e
of commons of England; and it is certainly the fir&s;t
time, that mention is made by hi&s;torians of any repre&s;en|tatives
&s;ent to parliament by the boroughs. In all the
general accounts given in preceding times of parliaments,
the nobility and barons are only &s;poke of as the con|&s;tituent
members; and even in the mo&s;t particular nar|ratives
delivered of parliamentary tran&s;actions, as in the
trial of Thomas a Becket, where the events of each day,
and almo&s;t of each hour, are carefully recorded by con|temporary
authors<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"></NOTE>, there is not, throughout the whole,
the lea&s;t appearance of a hou&s;e of commons. But tho'
that hou&s;e derived its fir&s;t exi&s;tence from &s;o precarious
and even &s;o invidious an origin as Leice&s;ter's u&s;urpa|tion,
it proved &s;oon, when &s;ummoned by the legal
princes, one of the mo&s;t u&s;eful, and, in proce&s;s of time,
<PB N="216" REF="239">
one of the mo&s;t powerful members of the national con|&s;titution;
and gradually re&s;cued the kingdom from ari&s;to|cratical
as well as from regal tyranny. But Leice&s;ter's
policy, if we mu&s;t a&s;cribe to him &s;o great a ble&s;&s;ing, only
forwarded by &s;ome years an in&s;titution, for which the
general &s;tate of things had already prepared the nation;
and it is otherwi&s;e inconceivable, that a plant, &s;et by &s;o
inau&s;picious a hand, could have attained to &s;o vigorous
a growth, and have flouri&s;hed in the mid&s;t of &s;uch tem|pe&s;ts
and convul&s;ions. The feudal &s;y&s;tem, with which
the liberty, much more the power of the commons, was
totally incompatible, began gradually to decline; and
both king and people, who felt its inconveniencies, con|tributed
to favour this new power, which was more &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive
than the barons to the regular authority of the
crown, and at the &s;ame time afforded protection to the
inferior orders of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>LEICESTER, having thus a&s;&s;embled a parliament of his
own model, and tru&s;ting to the attachment of the po|pulace
of London, &s;eized the opportunity of cru&s;hing his
rivals among the powerful barons. Robert de Ferrars,
earl of Derby, was accu&s;ed in the King's name, &s;eized,
and committed to cu&s;tody, without being brought to any
legal trial<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Chron. T. Wykes, p. 66. Ann. Waverl. p. 216.</NOTE>. John Gifford, menaced with the &s;ame
fate$ fled from London, and took &s;helter in the marches
of Wales. Even the earl of Gloce&s;ter, who&s;e power
and influence had &s;o much contributed to the &s;ucce&s;s of
the barons, but who was of late extremely di&s;gu&s;ted by
Leice&s;ter's arbitrary and in&s;olent conduct, who engro&s;&s;ed
the whole power of the party, found him&s;elf in danger
from the prevailing authority of his ancient confederate;
and he retired from parliament<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 671. Ann. Waverl. p. 216.</NOTE>. This known divi&s;ion
<PB N="217" REF="240">
among the leaders, gave courage to all Leice&s;ter's ene|mies
and to the King's friends; who were now &s;ure of
protection from &s;o potent a leader. Tho' Roger Mor|timer,
Hamon L'E&s;trange, and other powerful marchers
of Wales, had been obliged to leave the kingdom, their
authority &s;till remained over the territories &s;ubjected to
their juri&s;diction; and there were many others who were
di&s;po&s;ed to give di&s;turbance to the new government.
The animo&s;ities, in&s;eparable from the feudal ari&s;tocracy,
broke out with &s;uch fre&s;h violence, and threatened the
kingdom with new convul&s;ions and di&s;orders.</P>
<P>THE earl of Leice&s;ter, &s;urrounded with the&s;e difficul|ties,
embraced a mea&s;ure, from which he propo&s;ed to
reap &s;ome pre&s;ent advantages, but which proved in the
end the &s;ource of all his future calamities. The active
and intrepid prince Edward had langui&s;hed in pri&s;on ever
&s;ince the fatal battle of Lewes; and being extremely
popular in the kingdom, there aro&s;e a general de&s;ire of
&s;eeing him again re&s;tored to liberty<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Knyghton, p. 2451.</NOTE>. As Leice&s;ter found,
that he could with difficulty oppo&s;e the concurring wi&s;hes
of the nation, he &s;tipulated with the prince, that in
return, he &s;hould order his adherents to deliver up to the
barons, all their ca&s;tles, particularly tho&s;e on the borders
of Wales; and &s;hould &s;wear neither to depart the king|dom
during three years, nor introduce into it any foreign
forces<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ann. Waverl. p. 216.</NOTE>. The King took an oath to the &s;ame effect,
and he al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed a charter, in which he confirmed the
agreement or <HI>Mise</HI> of Lewes; and even permitted his &s;ub|jects
to ri&s;e in arms again&s;t him, if he &s;hould ever at|tempt
to infringe it<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Blacki&s;ton's Mag. Charts. Chron. Dun&s;t. vol. i. p. 378.</NOTE>. So little care had Leice&s;ter taken,
tho' he con&s;tantly made use of the authority of this cap|tive
<PB N="218" REF="241">
prince, to pre&s;erve to him any appearance of royalty
or kingly prerogatives.<NOTE PLACE="marg">11th March</NOTE></P>
<P>IN con&s;equence of this treaty, prince Edward was
brought into We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, and was declared free
by the barons: But in&s;tead of really recovering his
liberty, as he had vainly expected, he found, that
the whole tran&s;action was a fraud on the part of
Leice&s;ter; that he &s;till continued a pri&s;oner at large,
and was &s;trictly guarded by the emi&s;&s;aries of that
nobleman; and that while the faction reaped all the
benefit from the performance of his part of the
treaty, care was taken that he him&s;elf &s;hould enjoy no
advantage by it. As Glo|ce&s;ter, on his rupture with the
barons, had retired for &s;afety to his e&s;tates on the borders
of Wales; Leice&s;ter followed him with an army to
Hereford<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Chron. T. Wykes, p. 67. Ann. Waverl. p. 218. W. Heming. p. 585. Chron. Dun&s;t. vol. i. p. 383, 384.</NOTE>, continued &s;till to menace and negotiate, and
that he might add authority to his cau&s;e, he carried both
the King and prince along with him. The earl of Glo|ce&s;ter
here concerted with young Edward the manner of
that prince's e&s;cape. He found means to convey to him
a hor&s;e of an extraordinary &s;wiftne&s;s; and appointed Ro|ger
Mortimer, who had returned into the kingdom, to be
ready at hand with a &s;mall party to receive the prince,
and to guard him to a place of &s;afety.<NOTE PLACE="marg">28th May.</NOTE> Edward pretended
to take the air with &s;ome of Leice&s;ter's retinue, who
were his guards; and making matches between their
hor&s;es, after he thought he had tired and blown them &s;uf|ficiently,
he &s;uddenly mounted Gloce&s;ter's hor&s;e, and
called to his attendants, that he had long enough enjoyed
the plea&s;ure of their company, and now bid them adieu.
They followed him for &s;ome &s;pace, without being able
<PB N="219" REF="242">
to overtake him; and the appearance of Mortimer with
his company put an end to their pur&s;uit<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 672. Chron. T. Wykes, p. 97. Ann. Waverl. p. 218. W. Heming. p. 585. Knyghton, p. 2452.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE royali&s;ts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Eve&s;ham, and death of Leice&s;ter.</NOTE> &s;ecretly prepared for this happy event,
immediately flew to arms; and the joy of this gallant
prince's delivery, the oppre&s;&s;ions under which the nation
laboured, the expectation of a new &s;cene of affairs, and
the countenance of the earl of Gloce&s;ter, procured Edward
an army which Leice&s;ter was utterly unable to with|&s;tand<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Chron. T. Wykes, p. 68.</NOTE>.
This nobleman found him&s;elf in a remote quar|ter
of the kingdom, &s;urrounded by his enemies, barred
of all communication with his friends by the Severne,
who&s;e bridges Edward had broke down<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Chron. Dun&s;t. vol. i. p. 383.</NOTE>, and obliged to
fight the cau&s;e of his party under &s;uch multiplied di&s;ad|vantages.
In this extremity he wrote to his &s;on, Simon
de Montfort, to ha&s;ten from London with an army for
his relief; and Simon had advanced to Kenilworth,
with that view; where fancying that all Edward's force
and attention were directed again&s;t his father, he lay
perfectly &s;ecure and unguarded. But the prince, making
a &s;udden and forced march, &s;urprized him in his camp,
di&s;&s;ipated his army, and took the earl of Oxford, and
many other noblemen pri&s;oners, almo&s;t without re&s;i&s;t|ance<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 672. Chron. Mailr. p. 230. Chron. T. Wykes, p. 69. Ann. Waverl. p. 219. W. Heming. p. 586. Knyghton, p. 2452.</NOTE>.
Leice&s;ter, ignorant of his &s;on's fate, pa&s;&s;ed the
Severne in boats during Edward's ab&s;ence, and lay at
Eve&s;ham, in expectation of being every hour joined by
his friends from London: When the prince, who made
profit of every favourable moment, appeared in the field
before him. Edward made a body of his troops advance
<PB N="220" REF="243">
from the road which led to Kenilworth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th Augu&s;t.</NOTE> and ordered
them to carry the banners taken from Simon's army;
while he him&s;elf, making a circuit with the re&s;t of his
army, propo&s;ed to attack the enemy from the other
quarter<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 672. Chron. Mailr. p. 231.</NOTE>. Leice&s;ter was long deceived by this &s;tratagem,
and took one divi&s;ion of Edward's army for his friends;
but at la&s;t, perceiving his mi&s;take, and ob&s;erving the
great &s;uperiority and excellent di&s;po&s;ition of the royali&s;ts,
he exclaimed, that they had learned from him their mili|tary
order; adding, &startq;The Lord have mercy on our
&s;ouls: for I &s;ee our bodies are the prince's<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 672. W. Heming. p. 586. Knyghton, p. 2453.</NOTE>.&endq; The
battle immediately began, tho' on very unequal terms.
Leice&s;ter's army, by living in the mountains of Wales
without bread, which was not then much u&s;ed among
the inhabitants<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Chron. T. Wykes, p. 69.</NOTE>, had been extremely weakened by &s;ick|ne&s;s
and de&s;ertion, and was &s;oon broke by the victorious
royali&s;ts; while the Wel&s;h allies, accu&s;tomed only to a
de&s;ultory kind of war, immediately took to flight, and
were pur&s;ued with great &s;laughter<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Knyghton, p. 2453.</NOTE>. Leice&s;ter him&s;elf,
a&s;king for quarter, was &s;lain i$ the heat of the action,
with his elde&s;t &s;on Henry, Hugh le De&s;pen&s;er, and about
one hundred and &s;ixty knights, and many other gentle|men
of his party. The old King had been purpo&s;ely
placed by the rebels in the front of the battle; and being
clad in armour, and thereby not known by his friends,
he received a wound, and was in danger of his life: But
crying out, <HI>I am Henry of Winche&s;ter, your king,</HI> he was
&s;aved; and put in a place of &s;ecurity by his &s;on, who
flew to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Chron. de Mailr. p. 232. W. Heming. p. 587.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE violence, ingratitude, tyranny, rapacity, and
treachery of the earl of Leice&s;ter, give a very bad idea
of his moral character, and make us regard his death, as
<PB N="221" REF="244">
the mo&s;t happy event, which, in this conjuncture, could
have happened to the Engli&s;h nation: Yet mu&s;t we allow
the man to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great abilities, and the appear|ance
of great virtues, who, tho' a &s;tranger, could, at a
time when &s;trangers were the mo&s;t odious, and the mo&s;t
univer&s;ally decried, have acquired &s;o exten&s;ive an intere&s;t
in the kingdom, and have &s;o nearly paved his way to the
throne it&s;elf. His military capacity, and his political
craft, were equally eminent: He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the talents
both of governing men and conducting bu&s;ne&s;s: And
tho' his ambition was boundle&s;s, it &s;eems neither to have
exceeded his courage nor his genius; and he had the
happine&s;s of making the low populace, as well as the
haughty barons, co-operate towards the &s;ucce&s;s of his
&s;elfi&s;h and dangerous purpo&s;es. A prince of greater abi|lity
and vigour than Henry might have directed the
talents of this nobleman either to the exaltation of his
throne, or to the good of his people: But the advan|tages
given to Leice&s;ter, by the weak and variable admi|ni&s;tration
of the King, brought on the ruin of royal au|thority,
and produced infinite confu&s;ions in the kingdom,
which however in the end pre&s;erved and extremely im|proved
the national liberty and con&s;titution. His popu|larity,
even after his death, continued &s;o great, that,
tho' excommunicated by Rome, the people believed him
to be a &s;aint; and many miracles were &s;aid to be wrought
upon his tomb<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Chron. de Mailr. p. 232.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE victory of Eve&s;ham,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Settlement of the go|vernment.</NOTE> with the death of Leice&s;ter,
proved deci&s;ive in favour of the royali&s;ts, and made an
equal, tho' a very oppo&s;ite impre&s;&s;ion on friends and
enemies, in every part of England. The King of
the Romans recovered his liberty: The other pri&s;oners of
the royal party were not only freed, but courted, by their
keepers: Fitz-Richard, the &s;editious mayor of London,
<PB N="222" REF="245">
who had marked out forty of the mo&s;t wealthy citizen$
for &s;laughter immediately &s;topped his hand on receiving
news of this great event: And almo&s;t all the ca&s;tles gar|ri&s;oned
by the barons, ha&s;tened to make their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions
and to open their gates to the King. The i&s;le of Ax|holme
alone, and that of Ely, tru&s;ting to the &s;trength
of their &s;ituation, ventured to make re&s;i&s;tance; but were
at la&s;t reduced, as well as the ca&s;tle of Dover, by the
valour and activity of prince Edward<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 676. W. Heming. p. 588.</NOTE>. Adam de Gour|don,
a courageous baron,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1266.</NOTE> maintained him&s;elf &s;ome time
in the fore&s;ts of Hamp&s;hire, committed depredations in
the neighbourhood, and obliged the prince to lead a body
of troops into that country again&s;t him. Edward at|tacked
the camp of the rebels; and being tran&s;ported
by the ardour of action, leapt over the trench with a few
followers, and encountered Gourdon him&s;elf in &s;ingle
combat. The victory was long di&s;puted between the&s;e
valiant combatants; but ended at la&s;t in the prince's
favour, who wounded his antagoni&s;t, threw him from
his hor&s;e, and took him pri&s;oner. He not only granted
him his life; but introduced him that very night to the
queen at Guilford, procured him his pardon, re&s;tored
him to his e&s;tate, received him into favour, and was
ever after very faithfully &s;erved by him<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, P. 675.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A TOTAL victory of the &s;overeign over &s;o exten&s;ive a
rebellion commonly produces a revolution of govern|ment,
and &s;trengthens, as well as enlarges, for &s;ome
time, the prerogatives of the crown: Yet no &s;acrifices
of national liberty were made on this occa&s;ion; the great
charter remained &s;till inviolate; and the King, &s;en&s;ible
that his own barons, by who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance alone he had
prevailed, were no le&s;s jealous of their independance
than the other party, &s;eems thenceforth to have more
<PB N="223" REF="246">
carefully ab&s;tained from all tho&s;e exertions of arbitrary
power, which had afforded &s;o plau&s;ible a pretence to the
rebels. The clemency of this victory is al&s;o remark|able:
No blood was &s;hed on the &s;caffold: No attainders,
except of the Mountfort family, were executed: And
tho' a parliament, a&s;&s;embled at Winche&s;ter, forfeited all
tho&s;e, who had borne arms again&s;t the King, ea&s;y com|po&s;itions
were made with them for their lands<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 675.</NOTE>; and
the highe&s;t &s;um, levied on the mo&s;t notorious offenders,
exceeded not five years rent of their e&s;tate. Even the
earl of Derby, who again rebelled, after having been
pardoned and re&s;tored to his fortune, was obliged to pay
only &s;even years rent, and was a &s;econd time re&s;tored.
The mild di&s;po&s;ition of the King, and the prudence of
the prince, tempered the in&s;olence of victory, and gra|dually
re&s;tored order to the &s;everal members of the &s;tate,
disjointed by &s;o long a continuance of civil wars and
commotions.</P>
<P>THE city of London, which had carried farthe&s;t the
rage and animo&s;ity again&s;t the King, and which &s;eemed
determined to &s;tand upon its defence after almo&s;t all the
kingdom had &s;ubmitted, was, after &s;ome interval, re|&s;tored
to mo&s;t of its liberties and privileges, and Fitz-Richard,

&s;ons, Simon and Guy<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Chron. T. Wykes, p. 72.</NOTE>, who proved very ungrateful for

<P>THE merits of the earl of Gloce&s;ter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1267.</NOTE> after he returned
to his allegiance, had been &s;o great, in re&s;toring the
prince to his liberty, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting him in his victories
again&s;t the rebellious barons, that it was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;i|ble
to content him in his demands; and his youth and
temerity, as well as his great power, tempted him, on
&s;ome new di&s;gu&s;t, to rai&s;e again the flames of rebellion
in the kingdom. The mutinous populace of London, at
his in&s;tigation, took to arms; and the prince was obliged
to collect an army of 30,000 men, in order to &s;uppre&s;s
them<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Chron. T. Wykes, p. 79.</NOTE>. Even this &s;econd rebellion did not provoke the
King to any acts of cruelty; and the earl of Gloce&s;ter
him&s;elf e&s;caped with a total impunity. He was only
obliged to enter into a bond of 20,000 marks, that he
never again would be guilty of rebellion<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Chron. T. Wykes, p. 81.</NOTE>: A &s;trange
method of enforcing the laws, and a proof of the dange|rous
independance of the barons in tho&s;e ages! The&s;e
potent nobles were, from the danger of the example,
aver&s;e to the execution of the laws of forfeiture and fe|lony
again&s;t any of their brethren; tho' they could not
with a good grace refu&s;e to concur in obliging them to
fulfil any voluntary contract and engagement, into which
they had entered.</P>
<P>THE prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1270</NOTE> finding the &s;tate of the kingdom tolera|bly
compo&s;ed, was &s;educed, by his avidity for glory,
and by the prejudices of the age, as well as by the ear|ne&s;t
&s;ollicitations of the King of France, to undertake
an expedition again&s;t the infidels in the Holy Land<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 677.</NOTE>;
<PB N="225" REF="248">
and he endeavoured previou&s;ly to &s;ettle the &s;tate in &s;uch
a manner, as to dread no bad effects from his ab&s;ence.
As the dangerous power and turbulent di&s;po&s;ition of the
earl of Gloce&s;ter gave him apprehen&s;ions, he in&s;i&s;ted on
carrying him along with him, in con&s;equence of a vow,
which that nobleman had made to undertake the &s;ame
voyage; and in the mean time, he obliged him to re&s;ign
&s;ome of his ca&s;tles, and to enter into a new bond not to
di&s;turb the peace of the kingdom<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Chron. T. Wykes, p. 90.</NOTE>. He failed from Eng|land
with an army; and arrived in Lewis's camp before
Tunis in Africa, where he found that great monarch al|ready
dead, from the intemperance of the climate and the
fatigues of his enterprize. The great and only weakne&s;s
of this prince in his government was the imprudent zeal
for Cru&s;ades; but it was this prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion chiefly that
procured him from the clergy the title of St. Lewis, by
which he is known in the French hi&s;tory; and if that
appellation had not been &s;o extremely pro&s;tituted by the
Romi&s;h church, as to become rather a term of reproach,
he &s;eems, by his uniform probity and goodne&s;s, as well
as his piety, to have fully merited the title. He was
&s;ucceeded by his &s;on, Philip, denominated the Hardy; a
prince of &s;ome merit, tho' much inferior to that of his
father.</P>
<P>PRINCE Edward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1271.</NOTE> not di&s;couraged by this event, conti|nued
his voyage to the Holy land, where he &s;ignalized
him&s;elf by acts of valour: Revived the glory of the Eng|li&s;h
name in tho&s;e parts: And &s;truck &s;uch terror into the
Saracens, that they employed an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in to murder him,
who wounded him in the arm, but peri&s;hed in the at|tempt<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 678, 679. W. Heming. p. 520.</NOTE>.
Mean while, his ab&s;ence from England was
attended with many of tho&s;e pernicious con&s;equences,
<PB N="226" REF="249">
which had been dreaded from it. The laws were not
executed:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1272.</NOTE> The barons oppre&s;&s;ed the common people<NOTE PLACE="marg">16th Novr. Death</NOTE>
with impunity<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Chron. Dun&s;t. vol. i. p. 404.</NOTE>: They gave &s;helter on their e&s;tates to
bands of robbers, whom they employed in committing
ravages on the e&s;tates of their enemies: The populace of
London returned to their u&s;ual licentiou&s;ne&s;s: And the
old King, unequal to the burthen of government, called
aloud for his gallant &s;on to return<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 869. M. Paris, p. 678.</NOTE>, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in
&s;waying that &s;cepter, which was ready to drop from his
feeble and uncertain hands. At la&s;t, overcome by the
cares of government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1272.</NOTE> and the infirmities of age, he vi&s;i|bly
declined, and he expired at St. Edmond&s;bury in the
64th year of his age, and 56th of his reign; the longe&s;t
reign which is to be met with in the Engli&s;h annals.
His brother, the King of the Romans (for he never at|tained
the title of emperor) died about &s;even months
before him.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t obvious circum&s;tance of Henry the third's
character is his incapacity for government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and charac|ter of the King.</NOTE> which ren|dered
him as much a pri&s;oner in the hands of his own
mini&s;ters and favourites, and as little at his own di&s;po&s;al, as
when detained a captive in the hands of his enemies.
From this &s;ource, rather than from in&s;incerity or trea|chery,
aro&s;e his negligence in ob&s;erving his promi&s;es;
and he was too ea&s;ily induced, for the &s;ake of pre&s;ent
convenience, to &s;acrifice the la&s;ting advantages ari&s;ing
from the tru&s;t and confidence of his people. Hence
were derived his profu&s;ion to favourites, his attachment
to &s;trangers, the variablene&s;s of his conduct, his ha&s;ty
re&s;entments, and his &s;udden forgivene&s;s and return of
affection. In&s;tead of reducing the dangerous power of
his nobles, by obliging them to ob&s;erve the laws towards
their inferiors, and &s;etting them the &s;alutary example in
<PB N="227" REF="250">
his own government; he was &s;educed to imitate their
conduct, and to make his arbitrary will, or rather that
of his mini&s;ters, the rule of his actions. In&s;tead of ac|commodating
him&s;elf, by a &s;trict frugality, to the em|barra&s;&s;ed
&s;ituation in which his revenue had been left, by
the military expeditions of his uncle, the di&s;&s;ipations of
his father, and the u&s;urpations of the barons; he was
tempted to levy money by irregular exactions, which,
without enriching him&s;elf, impoveri&s;hed, at lea&s;t di&s;gu&s;t|ed
his people. Of all men, nature &s;eemed lea&s;t to have
fitted him for being a tyrant; yet are there in&s;tances
of oppre&s;&s;ion in his reign, which, tho' derived from the
precedents left him by his predece&s;&s;ors, had been care|fully
guarded again&s;t by the great charter, and are incon|&s;i&s;tent
with all rules of good government. And on the
whole, we may &s;ay, that greater abilities with his good
di&s;po&s;itions, would have prevented him from falling into
his faults; or with wor&s;e di&s;po&s;itions, would have en|abled
him to maintain and defend them.</P>
<P>THIS prince was noted for his piety and devotion, and
his regular attendance on public wor&s;hip; and a &s;aying of
his on that head is much celebrated by antient writers.
He was engaged in a di&s;pute with Lewis IX. of France,
concerning the preference between &s;ermons and ma&s;&s;es:
He maintained the &s;uperiority of the latter, and affirmed,
that he would rather have one hour's conver&s;ation with a
friend, than hear twenty the mo&s;t elaborate di&s;cour&s;es,
pronounced in prai&s;e of him<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Walfing. Edw. I. p. 43.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY left two &s;ons, Edward his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and Ed|mond
earl of Lanca&s;ter; and two daughters, Margaret
queen of Scotland, and Beatrix dutche&s;s of Britanny.
He had five other children, who died in their infancy.</P>
<P>THE following are the mo&s;t remarkable laws enacted
during this reign.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mi&s;cellane|ous tran&s;ac|tions of this reign.</NOTE> There had been great di&s;putes be|tween
<PB N="228" REF="251">
the civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts about ba&s;tardy.
The common law had deemed all tho&s;e ba&s;tards who
were born before wedlock: By the canon law they were
legitimate: And when any di&s;pute of inheritance aro&s;e,
it had been formerly u&s;ual for the civil courts to i&s;&s;ue
writs to the &s;piritual, directing them to enquire into the
legitimacy of the per&s;on. The bi&s;hop always returned
an an&s;wer agreeable to the canon law, tho' contrary to
the municipal law of the kingdom. For this rea&s;on,
the civil courts had changed the nature of their writ, and
in&s;tead of requiring the &s;piritual courts to enquire con|cerning
the legitimacy of the per&s;on, they only propo&s;ed
the &s;imple que&s;tion of fact, whether he was born before
or after the marriage. The prelates complained of this
practice to the parliament a&s;&s;bled at Merton in the
twentieth of this King, and de&s;ired that the civil law
might be rendered conformable to the canon: But re|ceived
from all the nobility the memorable reply: <HI>Nolu|mus
leges Angliae mutare:</HI> We will not change the laws
of England<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Statute of Merton, chap. 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER the civil wars, the parliament, &s;ummoned at
Marlebridge, gave their approbation to mo&s;t of the or|dinances,
which had been enacted by the reforming
barons, and which, tho' advantageous to the &s;ecurity of
the people, had not received the &s;anction of a proper au|thority.
Among other laws, it was there enacted, that
all appeals from the courts of inferior lords &s;hould be
carried directly to the King's courts without pa&s;&s;ing thro'
the courts of the lords immediately &s;uperior<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Statute of Marleb, chap. 20.</NOTE>. It was
ordained that money &s;hould bear no intere&s;t during the
minority of the creditor<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Id. chap. 16.</NOTE>. This law was very rea&s;on|able,
as the e&s;tates of minors were always in the hands
of their lords, and the creditors could not pay intere&s;t
<PB N="229" REF="252">
where they had no revenue. The charter of King John
had granted this indulgence: It was omitted in that of
Henry III. for what rea&s;on is unknown; but it was re|newed
in the &s;tatute of Marlebridge. Mo&s;t of the other
articles of this &s;tatute are calculated to re&s;train the op|pre&s;&s;ions
of &s;heriffs, and the violences and iniquities
committed in di&s;training cattle and other goods. Cattle
and the in&s;truments of hu&s;bandry compo&s;ed at that time
the chief riches of the people.</P>
<P>IN the 35th year of this King an a&s;&s;ze was fixed of
bread, the price of which was &s;ettled, according to the
different prices of corn, from one &s;hilling a quarter to
&s;even &s;hillings and fix pence<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Statutes at large, p. 6.</NOTE>. The&s;e great variations
alone are a proof of bad tillage: Yet did the prices often
ri&s;e much higher, than any taken notice of by the laws.
The Chronicle of Dun&s;table tells us, that in this reign,
wheat was once &s;old for a mark, nay for a pound a quar|ter;
that is, three pounds of our pre&s;ent money<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">So al&s;$ Knyghton, p. 2444.</NOTE>. The
&s;ame law affords us a proof of the little communication
between the parts of the kingdom, by remarking the very
different prices which the &s;ame commodity bore at the
&s;ame time. A brewer, &s;ays the &s;tatute, may &s;ell two
gallons of ale for a penny in cities, and three or four
gallons for the &s;ame price in the country. At pre&s;ent,
&s;uch commodities, by che great con&s;umption of the people,
and the great &s;tocks of the brewers, are rather cheape&s;t
in cities. The Chronicle of Dun&s;table ob&s;erves, that
wheat one year was &s;old in many places for eight &s;hillings
a quarter, but never ro&s;e in Dun&s;table above a crown.</P>
<P>THO' commerce was &s;till very low, it &s;eems rather to
have encrea&s;ed &s;ince the Conque&s;t; at lea&s;t, if we may
judge of the encrea&s;e of money by the price of bread.
The medium between the highe&s;t and lowe&s;t prices
<PB N="230" REF="253">
of wheat, a&s;&s;igned by the &s;tatute, is four &s;hillings and
three pence a quarter, that is, twelve &s;hillings and nine
pence of our pre&s;ent money. This is near the half of
the middling price in our time. Yet the middling price
of cattle, &s;o late as the reign of King Richard, we found
to be above eight times lower than the pre&s;ent. Is not
the true inference, from comparing the&s;e facts, that in
all uncivilized nations, cattle, which propagate of them|&s;elves,
bear always a lower price than corn, which re|quires
more art and &s;tock to raise it, than the&s;e nations
are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of? It is to be remarked, that Henry's
a&s;&s;ize of corn was copied from a preceding a&s;&s;ize e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
by King John; and con&s;equently, the prices
which we have here compared of corn and cattle may be
looked on as contemporary; and they were drawn, not
from one particular year, but from an e&s;timation of the
middling prices. It is true, the prices, a&s;&s;igned by the
a&s;&s;ize of Richard, were meant as a &s;tandard for the ac|compts
of &s;heriffs and e&s;cheators; and as con&s;iderable
profits were allowed to them, we may naturally &s;uppo&s;e,
that the common value of cattle was &s;omewhat higher:
Yet &s;till, &s;o great a difference between the prices of
corn and cattle as that of four to one, compared to the
pre&s;ent rates, affords important reflections concerning the
very different &s;tate of indu&s;try and tillage in the two
periods.</P>
<P>INTEREST had in that age mounted to an enormous
height, as might be expected from the barbari&s;m of the
times and mens ignorance of commerce. There are in|&s;tances
of fifty per cent payed for money<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p 586.</NOTE>. Such pro|fits
tempted the Jews to remain in England, notwith|&s;tanding
the grievous oppre&s;&s;ons to which they were
continually expo&s;ed from the prevalent bigotry and rapine
of the age. It is ea&s;y to imagine how precarious their
<PB N="231" REF="254">
&s;tate mu&s;t be under an indigent prince, &s;omewhat re|&s;trained
in his tyranny over his native &s;ubjects, but who
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an unlimited authority over them, the &s;ole pro|prietors
of money in the kingdom, and hated on account
of their riches, their religion, and their u&s;ury: Yet will
our ideas &s;carce come up to the extortions which in fact
we &s;hall find to have been practi&s;ed upon them. In the
year 1241, 20,000 marks were ex$cted from them<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 372.</NOTE>:
Two years after, money was again extorted; and one
Jew alone, Aaron of York, was obliged to pay above
4000 marks<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 410.</NOTE>: In 1250, Henry renewed his oppre&s;&s;ions;
and the &s;ame Aaron was condemned to pay him 30,000
marks upon an accu&s;ation of forgery<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 525.</NOTE>: The high pe|nalty
impo&s;ed upon him, and which, it &s;eems, he was
thought able to pay, is rather a pre&s;umption of his in|nocence
than of his guilt. In 1255, the King demanded
8000 marks from the Jews, and threatened to hang
them, if they refu&s;ed compliance. They now lo&s;t all
patience, and de&s;ired leave to retire with their effects out
of the kingdom. But the King replied:
&startq;How can I
remedy the oppre&s;&s;ions you complain of? I am myself
a beggar. I am de&s;poiled, I am &s;tripped, of all my
revenues: I owe above 200,000 marks; and if I had
&s;aid 300,000, I &s;hould not exceed the truth: I am
obliged to pay my &s;on, prince Edward, 15,000 marks
a year: I have not a farthing; and I mu&s;t have money,
from any hand, from any quarter, or by any means.&endq;

&s;um required of him<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 160.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To give a better pretence to extortions, the impro|bable
and ab&s;urd accu&s;ation, which has been at different
times advanced again&s;t that nation, was revived in Eng|land,
that they had crucified a child in deri&s;ion of our
Saviour's &s;ufferings. Eighteen of them were hanged at
once for this crime<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 613.</NOTE>: Tho' it is no wife credible, that
even the antipathy born them by the Chri&s;tians, and the
oppre&s;&s;ions under which they laboured, would ever have
pu&s;hed them to be guilty of that dangerous enormity. But
it is natural to imagine, that a race, expo&s;ed to &s;uch in|&s;ults
and indignities both from king and people, and who
had &s;o uncertain an enjoyment of their riches, would
carry u&s;ury to the greate&s;t extremities, and by their
great profits make them&s;elves &s;ome compen&s;ation for their
continued perils.</P>
<P>COMMERCE mu&s;t be in a wretched condition where
intere&s;t was &s;o high, and where the &s;ole proprietors of
money were expo&s;ed to &s;uch rapine and inju&s;tice. But
the bad police of the country was another ob&s;tacle to all
improvements; and rendered all communication dan|gerous,
and all property precarious. The Chronicle of
Dun&s;table &s;ays<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Vol. i. p. 155.</NOTE>, that men during this reign were never
&s;ecure in their hou&s;es, and that whole villages were often
plundered by bands of robbers, tho' no civil wars pre|vailed
in the kingdom. In 1249, &s;ome years before the
in&s;urrection of the baron$, two merchants of Brabant
came to the King at Winche&s;ter, and told him, that
they had been de&s;poiled of all their goods by certain
robbers, whom they knew, becau&s;e they &s;aw their faces
every day in his court; that like practices prevailed all
<PB N="233" REF="258">
over England, and travellers were every day robbed,
bound, wounded, and murdered; that the&s;e crimes e&s;ca|ped
with impunity, becau&s;e the mini&s;ters of ju&s;tice them|&s;elves
were in a con&s;ederacy with the robbers; and that
they for their part, in&s;tead of bringing matters to a fruit|le&s;s
trial by law, were willing, tho' merchants, to try
their cau&s;e with the robbers by arms and a duel. The
King, provoked at the&s;e abu&s;es, ordered a jury to be in|clo&s;ed,
and to try the robbers: The jury, tho' con&s;i&s;ting
of twelve men of property in Hamp&s;hire, were found
to be al&s;o in a con&s;ederacy with the robbers, and acquit|ted
them. Henry in a rage committed the jury to pri&s;on,
threatened them with &s;evere puni&s;hment, and ordered a
new jury to be enclo&s;ed, who, dreading the fate of their
fellows, at la&s;t found a verdict again&s;t the criminals.
Many of the King's own hou&s;ehold were di&s;covered to
have participated in the guilt; and &s;aid for their excu&s;e,
that they received no wages from him, and were obliged
to rob for a maintenance<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 509.</NOTE>. <HI>Knights and e&s;quires,</HI> &s;ays

the manners of the times!</P>
<P>ONE can the le&s;s repine, during the prevalence of &s;uch
manners, at the frauds and forgeries of the clergy; as it
gives much le&s;s di&s;turbance to &s;ociety, to take men's money
from them with their own con&s;ent, tho' by deceits and
lies, than to ravi&s;h it by open force and violence. During
this reign, the papal power was at its &s;ummit, and was
even beginning in&s;en&s;ibly to decline, by rea&s;on of the im|mea&s;urable
avarice and extortions of the court of Rome,
which di&s;gu&s;ted the clergy as well as laity in every king|dom
of Europe. England it&s;elf, tho' &s;unk in the deep|e&s;t
aby&s;s of ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition, had &s;eriou&s;ly en|tertined
<PB N="234" REF="259">
thoughts of &s;haking off the papal yoke<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 421.</NOTE>; and
the Roman pontiff was obliged to think of new expedients
for rivetting it fa&s;ter upon them. For this purpo&s;e,
Gregory IX. publi&s;hed his decretals<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. 191.</NOTE>, which are a col|lection
of forgeries, favourable to the court of Rome,
and con&s;i&s;t of the &s;uppo&s;ed decrees of Popes in the fir&s;t
centuries. But the&s;e forgeries are &s;o gro&s;s, and confound
&s;o palpably all language, hi&s;tory, chronology, and anti|quities;
matters more &s;tubborn than any &s;peculative
truths whatever; that even that church, which is not
&s;tartled at the mo&s;t mon&s;trous contradictions and ab&s;ur|dities,
has been obliged to abandon them to the critics.
But in the dark age of the thirteenth century, they pa&s;&s;|ed
for undi&s;puted and authentic; and men, entangled in
the mazes of this fal&s;e literature, joined to the philo&s;ophy,
equally fal&s;e, of the times, had nothing wherewithal to
defend them&s;elves, but &s;ome &s;mall remains of common
&s;en&s;e, which pa&s;&s;ed for pro&s;anene&s;s and impiety, and the
indelible regard to &s;elf-intere&s;t, which, as it was the &s;ole
motive in the prie&s;ts for framing the&s;e impo&s;tures, &s;er|ved
al&s;o, in &s;ome degree, to protect the laity again&s;t
them.</P>
<P>ANOTHER expedient, devised by the church of Rome
in this period for &s;ecuring its power, was the in&s;titution
of new religious orders, and chiefly the Dominicans and
Franci&s;cans, who proceeded with all the zeal and &s;ucce&s;s
that attend novelties; were better qualified to gain the
populace than the old orders, now become rich and indo|lent;
maintained a perpetual naval&s;hip with each other in
promoting their gainful &s;uper&s;titions; and acquired a great
dominion over the minds, and con&s;equently over the pur&s;es
of men, by counter&s;eiting a de&s;ire of poverty and a contempt
for riches. The quarrels, which aro&s;e between the&s;e orders,
<PB N="235" REF="260">
lying &s;till under the controul of the &s;overeign pontiff, never
di&s;turbed the peace of the church, and &s;erved only as a
&s;pur to their indu&s;try in promoting the common cau&s;e;
and tho' the Dominicans lo&s;t &s;ome popularity by their de|nial
of the immaculate conception, a point in which they
unwarily engaged too far to be able to recede with ho|nour,
they counterbalanced this di&s;advantage by acqui|ring
more &s;olid e&s;tabli&s;hments, by gaining the confidence
of kings and princes, and by exerci&s;ing the juri&s;diction
a&s;&s;igned them, of ultimate judges and puni&s;hers of here&s;y.
Thus, the &s;everal orders of monks became a kind of re|gular
troops or garri&s;ons of the Romi&s;h church; and
tho' the temporal intere&s;ts of &s;ociety, &s;lill more tho&s;e of
true piety, were hurt by their various devices to catch
the populace, they proved the chief &s;upports of that
mighty fabric of &s;uper&s;tition, and, till the revival of true
learning, &s;ecured it from any dangerous inva&s;ion.</P>

<P>THE Engli&s;h were as yet &s;o little trained to obe|dience
under a regular government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XIII.</NOTE> that the death
of almo&s;t every King, &s;ince the conque&s;t, had been at|tended
with di&s;orders; and the council, reflecting on the
recent civil wars, and on the animo&s;ities which naturally
remain after the&s;e great convul&s;ions, had rea&s;on to appre|hend
very dangerous con&s;equences from the ab&s;ence of
the &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Henry. They therefore ha&s;tened
to proclaim prince Edward, to &s;wear allegiance to him,
and to &s;ummon the &s;ates of the kingdom, in order to
provide for the public peace in this important conjunc|ture<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. I. Walfing. p. 43. Trivet, p. 239.</NOTE>.
Walter Giffard, archbi&s;hop of York, the earl
<PB N="237" REF="262">
of Cornwal, &s;on of Richard, King of the Romans, and
the earl of Gloce&s;ter, were appointed guardians of the
kingdom, and proceeded peaceably to the exerci&s;e of their
authority, without either meeting with oppo&s;ition from
any of the people, or being di&s;turbed with emulation and
faction among them&s;elves. The high character acq$ired
by Edward during the late commotions, his military ge|nius,
his &s;ucce&s;s in &s;ubduing the rebels, his moderation
in &s;ettling the kingdom, had procured him great e&s;teem,
mixt with affection, among all orders of men; and no
one could rea&s;onably entertain hopes of making any ad|vantage
of his ab&s;ence, or of railing di&s;turbance in the na|tion.
The earl of Gloce&s;ter him&s;elf, who&s;e great power,
and turbulent &s;pirit, had excited mo&s;t jealou&s;y, was for|ward
to give proofs of his allegiance; and any malecon|tents,
who remained, being de&s;titute of a leader, were
obliged to remain in &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the government.</P>
<P>PRINCE Edward had reached Sicily in his return from
the Holy Land, when he received information of the
death of his father; and he di&s;covered a deep concern on
this occa&s;ion. At the &s;ame time he learned the death of
an infant &s;on, John, whom his prince&s;s, Eleanor of
Ca&s;tile, had born him at Acre in Pale&s;tine; and as he ap|peared
much le&s;s affected with that misfortune, the king
of Sicily expre&s;&s;ed a &s;urprize at this difference of &s;enti|ment:
But was told by Edward, that the death of a &s;on
was a lo&s;s which he might hope to repair; the death of
a father was a lo&s;s irreparable<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ingh. p. 44. Trivet, p. 240.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>EDWARD proceeded homewards;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1273</NOTE> but as he &s;oon learn|ed
the quiet &s;ettlement of the kingdom, he was in no
hurry to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne, but &s;pent near a
year in France, before he made his appearance in Eng|land.
In his pa&s;&s;age by Chalons in Burgundy, he was
<PB N="238" REF="263">
challenged by the prince of that country to a tournament
which he was preparing; and as Edward excelled in the&s;e
martial and dangerous exerci&s;es, the true image of war,
he declined not the opportunity of acquiring honour and
renown, in that great a&s;&s;embly of the neighbouring
nobles. But the image of war was here unfortunately
turned into the thing it&s;elf. Edward and his retinue were
&s;o &s;ucce&s;sful in the jou&s;ts, that the French knights, pro|voked
at their &s;uperiority, made a &s;erious attack upon
them, which was repul&s;ed, and a good deal of blood was
idly &s;hed in the quarrel<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ingh. p. 44. Trivet, p. 241. M. We&s;t. p. 402.</NOTE>. This rencounter received the
name of the petty battle of Chalons.</P>
<P>EDWARD went from Chalons to Paris,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1274</NOTE> and did ho|mage
to Philip for the dominions which he held in<NOTE PLACE="marg">29th AUG.</NOTE>
France<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing. p. 45.</NOTE>. He thence returned to Guienne, and gave a
&s;ettlement to that province, which was in &s;ome confu&s;ion.
He made his journey to London thro' France; in his
pa&s;&s;age he accommodated at Montreuil a difference with
Margaret, counte&s;s of Flanders, heire&s;s of that territory<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 32, 33.</NOTE>;
he was received with joyful acclamations by his people,
and was &s;olemnly crowned at We&s;tmin&s;ter by Robert,
archbishop of Canterbury.</P>
<P>THE King immediately applied him&s;elf to the re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hment
of his kingdom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Civil admi|ni&s;tration of the king.</NOTE> and to the correcting of tho&s;e
di&s;orders, which the civil commotions and the loo&s;e ad|mini&s;tration
of his father had introduced into every part
of government. The plan of his policy was equally ge|nerous
and prudent. He con&s;idered the great barons
both as the immediate rivals of the crown, and the op|pre&s;&s;ors
of the people; and he propo&s;ed, by an exact di&s;|tribution
of ju&s;tice, and a rigid execution of the laws, to
give at once protection to the inferior orders of the state,
<PB N="239" REF="264">
and to dimini&s;h the arbitrary power of the great, on
which their dangerous authority was chiefly founded.
Making it a rule of his own conduct to ob&s;erve,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1275</NOTE> except
on extraordinary occa&s;ions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">16th Feb.</NOTE> the privileges &s;ecured to them
by the great charter, he acquired a right to in&s;i&s;t upon
their ob&s;ervance of the &s;ame charter towards their va&s;&s;als
and inferiors; and he made the crown be regarded by all
the gentry and commonalty of the kingdom, as the great
fountain of justice, and the general a&s;ylum again&s;t op|pre&s;&s;ion:
Be&s;ides enacting &s;everal excellent statutes, in a
parliament which he &s;ummoned at We&s;tmin&s;ter, he took
care to in&s;pect the conduct of all his magi&s;trates and
judges, to di&s;place &s;uch as were either negligent or cor|rupt,
to provide them with &s;ufficient force for the exe|cution
of ju&s;tice, to root out all bands and confederacies
of robbers, and to repre&s;s tho&s;e more &s;ilent robberies,
which were committed either by the power of the nobles,
or under the countenance of public authority. By this
rigid admini&s;tration, the face of the kingdom was &s;oon
changed; and order and ju&s;tice took place of violence
and oppre&s;&s;ion: But amid&s;t the excellent in&s;titutions and
public-&s;pirited plans of Edward, there &s;till appears &s;ome|what
both of the &s;everity of his per&s;onal character and of
the prejudices of the times.</P>
<P>As the various kinds of malefactors, the murderers,
robbers, incendiaries, ravi&s;hers, and plunderers, had be|come
&s;o numerous and powerful, that the ordinary mi|ni&s;ters
of ju&s;tice, e&s;pecially in the we&s;tern counties, were
afraid to execute the laws against them, the King found
it nece&s;&s;ary to provide an extraordinary remedy for the
evil; and he crected for the punishment of crimes a new
tribunal, which, however u&s;eful, would have been deem|ed,
in times of more regular liberty, a very great &s;tretch
of illegal and arbitrary power. It con&s;i&s;ted of commi&s;|&s;ioners,
who were empowered to enquire into di&s;orders
<PB N="240" REF="265">
and crimes of all kinds, and to inflict the proper puni&s;h|ments
upon them. The officers, charged with this unu&s;ual
commi&s;&s;ion,. made their circuits throughout the coun|ties
of England mo&s;t infected with this evil, and carried
terror into all tho&s;e parts of the kingdom. In their zeal
to punish crimes, they did not &s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;h be|tween
the innocent and guilty; the &s;malle&s;t &s;u&s;picion be|came
the ground of accu&s;ation and trial; the &s;lighte&s;t
evidence was received againi&s;t criminals; the pri&s;ons were
crowded with malefactors, real or pretended; &s;evere fines
were levied for &s;mall offences; and the King, tho' his
exhau&s;ted revenue was &s;upplied by this expedient, found
it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;top the cour&s;e of &s;o great rigour, and af|ter
terri&s;ying and di&s;&s;ipating by this tribunal. the gangs of
di&s;orderly people in England, he very prudently annulled
the commi&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Spellman's Glo&s;&s; in verbo T railba&s;tan. But Spellman was either mi&s;taken in placing this commi&s;&s;ion in the fifth year of the King, or it was renewed in $305. See Rymer, vol. ii. p. 960. Trivet, p. 338. M. We&s;t. p. 450.</NOTE>; and never afterwards renewed it.</P>
<P>AMONG the various di&s;orders, to which the kingdom
was &s;ubjet, no one was more univer&s;ally complained of
than the adulteration of the coin; and as this crime re|quired
more art than the Engli&s;h of that age, who
chiefly employed force and violence in their iniquities,
were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, the imputation fell chiefly upon the
Jews<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Wolfing. p. 48. Heming. vol. i. p. 6.</NOTE>. Edward al&s;o &s;eems to have indulged a &s;trong
prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion again&s;t that nation; and. this ill-judged zeal
for Chri&s;tianity being naturally augmented by an expeci|tion
to the Holy Land, he let loo&s;e the whole rigour of
his ju&s;tice again&s;t this unhappy people. Two hundred
and eighty of them were hanged at once for this crime
in London alone, be&s;ides tho&s;e who &s;uffered in other
parts of the kingdom.<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">T. Wykes, p. 107.</NOTE>. The hou&s;es and lands, (for the
<PB N="241" REF="266">
Jews had of late ventured to make purcha&s;es of that
kind) as well as the goods of great multitudes, were &s;old
and con&s;i&s;cated: And the King, left it &s;hould be &s;u&s;|pected,
that the riches of the &s;ufferers were the chief
part of their guilt, ordered one half of the money, rai&s;ed
by the&s;e con&s;i&s;cations, to be &s;et apart, and bestowed upon
&s;uch as were willing to be converted to Chri&s;tianity. But
the re&s;entment of their injuries was more prevalent over
them, than the temptation from their poverty; and very
few of them could be induced by intere&s;t to embrace the
religion of their per&s;ecutors. The mi&s;eries of this people
were not here terminated. Tho' the arbitrary talliages
and exactions levied upon them, had yielded a con&s;tant
and a considerable revenue to the crown; Edward,
prompted by his zeal and capacity, re&s;olved &s;ome time
after<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">In the year 1290.</NOTE> to purge the kingdom entirely of that hated race,
and to &s;eize to him&s;elf at once their whole property as
the reward of his labour<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing. p. 54. Heing. vol. 1. p. 20. Trivet, p. 266.</NOTE>. He left them only money
&s;ufficient to bear their charges into foreign countries,
where new per&s;ecutions and extortions awaited them:
But the inhabitants of the cinque ports, imitating the
bigotry and avidity of their &s;overeign, de&s;poiled mo&s;t of
them of this &s;mall pittance, and even threw many of the
Jews into the &s;ea: A crime, for which the King, who
was determined to be the &s;ole plunderer in his dominions,
inflicted a capital puni&s;hment upon them. No lets than
fifteen thou&s;and Jews were at this time robbed of their
effects and bani&s;hed the kingdom: Very few of that na|tion
have &s;ince lived in England: And as it is impo&s;&s;ible
for a kingdom to &s;ub&s;i&s;t without lenders of money, and
none will lend without a compen&s;ation, the practice of
u&s;ury, as it was then called, was thenceforth exerci&s;ed by
the Engli&s;h them&s;elves upon their fellow-citizens, or by
<PB N="242" REF="267">
Lombards and other foreigners. It is very much to be
que&s;tioned whether the dealings of the&s;e new u&s;urers
were equally open and unexceptionable with tho&s;e of
the old. By a law of Richard, it was enacted, that
three copies &s;hould be made of every bond given to a
Jew; one to be put into the hands of a public magi&s;trate,
another into tho&s;e of a man of credit, and a third to re|main
with the Jew him&s;elf<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. I 28.</NOTE>. But as the canon law,
&s;econded by the municipal, permitted no Chri&s;tian to re|ceive
interest, all tran&s;actions of this kind must, after
the banishment of the Jews, have become more &s;ecret
and clande&s;tine, and the lender, of con&s;equence, be paid
both for the u&s;e of his money, and for the infamy and
danger which he incurred by lending it.</P>
<P>THE great poverty of the crown, tho' no excu&s;e, was
probably the cau&s;e of this egregious tyranny exerci&s;ed
again&s;t the Jews; but Edward practi&s;ed al&s;o other more
honourable means of remedying that evil. He employed
a &s;trict &s;rugality in the management and di&s;tribution of
his revenue: He engaged the parliament to vote him a
fifteenth of all moveables; the Pope to grant him the
tenth of all eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues for three years; and
the merchants to con&s;ent to a perpetual impo&s;ition of
half a mark on every &s;ack of wool exported, and a mark
on three hundred &s;kins. He al&s;o i&s;&s;ued commi&s;&s;ions to
enquire into all encroachments on the royal deme&s;ne;
into the value of e&s;cheats, forfeitures, and ward&s;hips;
and in$o the means of repairing or improving every
branch of the revenue<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ann. Waverl. p. 235.</NOTE>. The commi&s;&s;ioners, in the exe|cution
of their office, began to carry matters too far
again&s;t the nobility, and to que&s;tion the titles to e&s;tates
which had been tran&s;mitted from father to &s;on for &s;everal
generations. Earl Warrenne, who had done &s;uch emi|ment
&s;ervice in the late reign, being required to show
<PB N="243" REF="268">
his titles, drew his &s;word; and &s;ubjoined, that William,
the Ba&s;tard, had not conquered the kingdom for him&s;elf
alone; his ance&s;tor was a joint adventurer in the cau&s;e;
and he him&s;elf was determined to maintain what had
from that period remained unque&s;tioned in his family.
The King, &s;en&s;ible of the danger, very prudently de|&s;i&s;ted
from making farther enquiries of this nature.</P>
<P>BUT the active &s;pirit of Edward could not long remain
without employment.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1276.</NOTE> He &s;oon after undertook an en|terprize
more &s;afe for him&s;elf,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conquest of Wales.</NOTE> and more advantageous to
his people. Lewellyn, prince of Wales, had been deeply
engaged with the Mount&s;ort &s;action; had entered into
all their con&s;piracies against the crown; had frequently
fought on their &s;ide; and till the battle of Evesham, &s;o
fatal to that party, had employed every expedient to de|pre&s;s
the royal cau&s;e, and to promote the &s;ucce&s;s of the
barons. In the general accommodation, made with the
vanqui&s;hed, Lewellyn had al&s;o obtained his pardon; but
as he was the mo&s;t powerful, and therefore the mo&s;t ob|noxious
va&s;&s;al of the crown, he had rea&s;on to entertain
anxiety about his &s;ituation, and to dread the future ef|fects
of re&s;entment and jealou&s;y in the English monarch.
For this rea&s;on, he had determined to provide for his &s;e|curity
by maintaining a &s;ecret corre&s;pondence with his
former a&s;&s;ociates; and he even made his addre&s;&s;es to a
daughter of the earl of Leice&s;ter, who was &s;ent to him
from beyond &s;ea, but being intercepted in her pa&s;&s;age
near the i&s;les of Scilly, was detainied in the court of Eng|land
<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing. p. 46, 47. Heming. vol. i. p. 5. Trivet, p. 248.</NOTE>. This incident encrea&s;ing the mutual jealou&s;y be|tween
Edward and Lewellyn, the latter, when required
to come to England, and do homage to the new Kings
&s;crupled to put him&s;elf into the hands of an enemy, de|&s;ired
a &s;afe conduct from Edward, in&s;i&s;ted upon having
<PB N="244" REF="269">
the King's &s;on and other noblemen delivered to him
ho&s;tages, and demanded, that his &s;pou&s;e &s;hould be pre|viou&s;ly
&s;et at liberty<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii, p. 68. Wal&s;ing. p. 46. Trivet, p. 247</NOTE>. The King, having now brought
the &s;tate to a full &s;ettlement, was not di&s;plea&s;ed with this
occa&s;ion of exerci&s;ing his authority, and &s;ubduing en|tirely
the principality of Wales. He refu&s;ed all Lew|ellyn's
demands, except that of a &s;afe conduct; &s;ent him
repeated &s;ummons to perform the duty of a va&s;&s;al; levied
an army to reduce him to obedience; obtained a new
aid of a fifteenth from parliament; and marched out
with certain a&s;&s;urance of &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t the enemy.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1277.</NOTE> Be|&s;ides
the great di&s;proportion of force between the king|dom
and principality, the circum&s;tances of the two &s;tates
were now entirely rever&s;ed; and the &s;ame inte&s;tine di&s;|&s;entions
which had formerly weakened England, now
prevailed in Wales, and had even taken place in the
reigning family. David and Roderic, brothers to Lew|ellyn,
had been di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of their inheritance by that
prince, had been obliged to have recour&s;e to the protec|tion
of Edward, and &s;econded with all their intere&s;t,
which was exten&s;ive, his attempts to en&s;lave their native
country. The wel&s;h prince had no other re&s;ource but
in the inacce&s;&s;ible &s;ituation of his mountains, which had
hitherto, thro' many ages, defended his forefathers againist
all the attempts of the Saxon and Norman conquerors;
and he retired among the hills of Snowdun, re&s;olute to
defend him&s;elf to the la&s;t extremity. But Edward equally
vigorous and cautious, entering by the north with a for|midable
army, pierced into the heart of the country; and
having carefully explored every road before him, and &s;e|cured
every pa&s;s behind him, approached the Wel&s;h ar|my
in its la&s;t retreat. He here avoided the putting to
trial the valour of a nation, proud of its antient inde|pendance,
and enflamed with animo&s;ity again&s;t its here|ditary
<PB N="245" REF="270">
ditary enemies; and he tru&s;ted to the &s;low, but &s;ure ef|fects
of famine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">19th Nov.</NOTE> for reducing that people to &s;ubjection.
The rude and &s;imple manners of the natives, as well as
the mountainous &s;ituation of their country, had made
them entirely neglect tillage, and tru&s;t to pa&s;turage a|lone
for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tance: A method of life which had
hitherto &s;ecured them again&s;t the irregular attempts of
the Engli&s;h, but expo&s;ed them to certain ruin, when the
conque&s;t of the country was &s;teddily pur&s;ued, and pru|dently
planned by Edward. De&s;titute of magazines,
cooped up in a narrow corner, they and their cattle &s;uf|fered
equally from famine; and Lewellyn, without be|ing
able to &s;trike a &s;troke for his independance, was at
la&s;t obliged to &s;ubmit at di&s;cretion, and receive the terms
impo&s;ed upon him by the victor<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">T. Wykes, p. 105.</NOTE>. He bound him&s;elf to
pay to Edward 50,000 l. as reparation of damages; to do
homage to the crown of England; to permit all the other
barons of Wales, except, four near Snowdun, to &s;wear
fealty to the &s;ame crown; to relinqui&s;h the country be|tween
Che&s;hire and the river Conway; to &s;ettle on his

<P>EDWARD, on the performance of the other articles,
remitted to the prince of Wales the payment of the

it is probable, the poverty of the country made it ab&s;o|lutely

&s;hould be di&s;agreeable to the Engli&s;h monarch<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Dr. Powell's Hi&s;t. of Wales, p. 344, 345.</NOTE>. There

&s;ummoned together all his military tenants, and advanced
into Wales with an army, which the inhabitants could

<P>THE King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1284.</NOTE> &s;en&s;ible that nothing kept alive the ideas

<P>THERE prevails a vulgar &s;tory, which, as it &s;uits ex|actly
the capacity of the monki&s;h writers, is carefully re|corded
by them: That Edward a&s;&s;embling the Wel&s;h,
promi&s;ed to give them a prince of unexceptionable man|ners,
a Wel&s;hman by birth, and one who could &s;peak
no other language. On their acclamations of joy, and
promi&s;e of obedience, he inve&s;ted in the principality his
&s;econd &s;on Edward, then an infant, who had been born
at Carnarvon. The death of his elde&s;t &s;on Alfon&s;o, &s;oon
after, made young Edward heir of the monarchy: The
principality of Wales was fully annexed to the crown;
and henceforth gives a title to the elde&s;t &s;on of the kings
of England.</P>
<P>THE &s;ettlement of Wales appeared &s;o complete to
Edward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1286.</NOTE> that in le&s;s than two years after, he went a|broad
<PB N="248" REF="273">
in order to make peace between Alphon&s;o, King

his father Philip le Hardy in the throne of France<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 149, 150, 174.</NOTE>.
The difference between the&s;e two princes had ari&s;en about
the kingdom of Sicily, which the Pope, after his hopes
from England failed him, had be&s;towed on Charles,
brother to St. Lewis, and which was claimed upon other
titles, by Peter King of Arragon, father to Alphon&s;o.
Edward had powers from both princes to &s;ettle the peace,
and he &s;ucceeded in his endeavours; but as the contro|ver&s;y
no wife regards England, we &s;hall not enter into
a detail of it. He &s;tayed abroad above three years;
and on his return, found many di&s;orders to have prevailed,
both from open violence, and from the corruption of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>THOMAS CHAMBERLAIN, a gentleman of &s;ome note,
had a&s;&s;embled &s;everal of his a&s;&s;ociates at Bo&s;ton, in Lin|coln&s;hire,
under pretence of holding a tournament, an
exerci&s;e practi&s;ed by the gentry only; but in reality with
a view of plundering the rich fair of Bo&s;ton, and rob|bing
the merchants. To facilitate his purpo&s;e, he pri|vately
&s;et fire to the town; and while the inhabitants
were employed in quenching the flames, the con&s;pirators
broke into the booths, and carried off the goods. Cham|berlain
him&s;elf was detected and hanged; but main|tained
&s;o &s;teddily the point of honour to his accomplices,
that he could not be prevailed with, by any offers of
promi&s;es, to di&s;cover any of them. Many other in&s;tan|ces
of robbery and violence broke out, in all parts of
England; tho' the fingular circum&s;tances, attending this
con&s;piracy, have made it alone be particularly recorded
hi&s;torians<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 16, 17.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT the corruption of the judges,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1289.</NOTE> by which the foun|tains
of ju&s;tice, were poi&s;oned, &s;eemed &s;till of more dan|gerous
<PB N="249" REF="274">
con&s;equence. Edward, in order to remedy this
prevailing abu&s;e, &s;ummoned a parliament, and brought
the judges to a trial, where all of them, except two, who
were clergymen, were convicted of this flagrant iniquity,
were fined, and depo&s;ed from their office. The amount
of the fines levied upon them, is alone a &s;ufficient proof
of their guilt; being above one hundred thou&s;and marks,
an immen&s;e &s;um in tho&s;e days, and &s;ufficient to defray
the charges of an expen&s;ive war between two great king|doms.
The King afterwards made all the new judges
&s;wear, that they would take no bribes; but his expe|dient,
of depo&s;ing and fining the old ones, was the more
effectual remedy.</P>
<P>WE come now to give an account of the affairs of
Scotland, which form the mo&s;t intere&s;ting tran&s;action of
this reign, and of &s;ome of the &s;ub&s;equent; tho' the in|tercour&s;e
of that kingdom with England, either in peace
or war, had hitherto produced &s;o few events of moment,
that to avoid tediou&s;ne&s;s, we have omitted many of them,
and have been very conci&s;e in relating the re&s;t. If the
Scots had, before this period, any real hi&s;tory, worthy
of the name, except what they pick up from &s;cattered
pa&s;&s;ages of the Engli&s;h hi&s;torians, the&s;e events, how|ever
minute, yet being the only foreign tran&s;actions of
the nation, might de&s;erve a place in it.</P>
<P>THO' the government of Scotland had been continu|ally
expo&s;ed to tho&s;e factions and convul&s;ions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of Scotland.</NOTE> which are
incident to all barbarous, and to many civilized nations;
and tho' the &s;ucce&s;&s;ions of their Kings, the only part of
their hi&s;tory which de&s;erves any credit, had been often
di&s;ordered by irregularities and u&s;urpations; the true
heir of the royal family had &s;till in the end prevailed,
and Alexander III. who had e&s;pou&s;ed Edward's &s;i&s;ter,
probably inherited, after a period of above eight hundred
years, and thro' a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of males, the &s;cepter of all
<PB N="250" REF="275">
the Scotti&s;h princes, who had governed the nation, &s;ince
its fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment in the i&s;land. This prince died in
1286 by a fall from his hor&s;e at Kinghorn<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Heming, vol. i. p. 29. Trivet, p. 267.</NOTE>, without
leaving any male i&s;&s;ue, and without any de&s;cendants, ex|cept
Margaret, born of Eric, King of Norway, and of
Margaret, daughter of the Scotti&s;h monarch. This prin|ce&s;s,
commonly called the maid of Norway, tho' a fe|male,
and an infant, and a foreigner, yet being the law|ful
heir of the kingdom, had, thro' her grandfather's
care, been recognized &s;ucce&s;&s;or by the &s;tates of Scotland<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 266.</NOTE>;
and on Alexander's death, the di&s;po&s;itions, which had
been previou&s;ly made again&s;t that event, appeared &s;o ju&s;t
and prudent, that no di&s;orders, as might naturally be
apprehended, en&s;ued in the kingdom. Margaret was
acknowledged queen of Scotland; five guardians, the
bi&s;hops of St. Andrews and Gla&s;gow, the earls of Fife
and Buchan, and James, &s;teward of Scotland, entered
peaceably upon the admini&s;tration; and the infant prin|ce&s;s,
under the protection of Edward, her great uncle,
and Eric, her father, who exerted them&s;elves on this
occa&s;ion, &s;eemed firmly &s;eated on the throne of Scotland.
The Engli&s;h monarch was naturally engaged to build
mighty projects on this event; and having lately, by
force of arms, brought Wales under &s;ubjection, he
attempted, by the marriage of Margaret with his elde&s;t
&s;on, Edward, to unite the whole i&s;land into one monar|chy,
and thereby to give it full &s;ecurity both again&s;t de|me&s;tic
convul&s;ions and foreign inva&s;ions. The amity,
which had of late prevailed between the two nations, and
which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1298.</NOTE> even in former times, had never been interrupted
by any violent wars or injuries, facilitated extremely the
execution of this project, &s;o favourable to the happine&s;s
and grandeur of both kingdoms; and the &s;tates of Scot|land
<PB N="251" REF="276">
readily gave their a&s;&s;ent to the Engli&s;h propo&s;als,
and even<NOTE PLACE="marg">1290.</NOTE> agreed, that their young &s;overeign &s;hould be
educated in the court of Edward. Anxious, however,
for the liberty and independancy of their country, they
took care to &s;tipulate very equitable conditions, ere they
entru&s;ted them&s;elves into the hands of &s;o great and &s;o
ambitious a monarch; that they &s;hould enjoy all their
antient laws, liberties, and cu&s;toms; that in ca&s;e young
Edward and Margaret &s;hould die without i&s;&s;ue, the
crown of Scotland &s;hould revert to the next heirs, and
&s;hould be inherited by them free and independent; that
the military tenants of the crown &s;hould never be o|bliged
to go out of Scotland, in order to do homage to
the &s;overeign of the united kingdoms, nor the; chapters
of cathedral, collegiate or conventual churches, in order
to make elections; that the parliaments, &s;ummoned for
Scots affairs, &s;hould always, be held within the bounds
of that kingdom; and that Edward &s;hould bind him&s;elf,
under the penalty of 100,000 marks, payable to the Pope
for the u&s;e of the holy wars, to ob&s;erve all the&s;e articles<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 482.</NOTE>.
It is not ea&s;y to conceive that two nations could have
treated more on a footing of equality than Scotland and
England maintained during the cour&s;e of this whole
tran&s;action: And tho' Edward gave his a&s;&s;ent to the ar|ticle,
concerning the future independancy of the Scot|ti&s;h
crown, with a <HI>&s;aving of his former rights;</HI> this re|&s;erve
gave no alarm, to the nobility of Scotland, both
becau&s;e the&s;e rights, having been hitherto little heard
of, had occa&s;ioned no di&s;turbance, and becau&s;e the Scots
had &s;o near a pro&s;pect of &s;eeing them entirely ab&s;orbed
in the rights of their &s;overeignty.</P>
<P>BUT this project,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1291.</NOTE> &s;o happily formed and &s;o amicably
conducted, failed of &s;ucce&s;s, by the &s;udden death of the
<PB N="252" REF="277">
Norvegian prince&s;s, who expired on her pa&s;&s;age to Scot|land<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 30. Trivet, p. 268.</NOTE>,
and left a very di&s;mal pro&s;pect to the kingdom.
Tho' di&s;orders were for the pre&s;ent obviated by the au|thority
of the regency formerly e&s;tabli&s;hed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Competi|tors for the crown of Scotland.</NOTE> the &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion
of the crown it&s;elf was now become an object of
di&s;pute; and the regents could not expect, that a con|trover&s;y,
which is not u&s;ually decided by rea&s;on and ar|gument
alone, would be peaceably &s;ettled by them,
or even by the &s;tates of the kingdom, amid&s;t &s;o
many powerful pretenders. The po&s;terity of Wil|liam,
King of Scotland, the prince, who was taken
prifoner by Henry II. being all extinct by the death
of Margaret of Norway; the right to the crown
was devolved on the line of David, earl of Hunting|ton,
brother to William, who&s;e male line, being al|&s;o
extinct, left the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion open to the po&s;terity of his
daughters. The earl of Huntington had three daugh|ters;
Margaret, married to Alan lord of Galloway, I&s;a|bella,
wife of Robert Brus or Bruce, lord of Annandale,
and Adama, who e&s;pou&s;ed Henry lord Ha&s;tings. Mar|garet,
the elde&s;t of the three &s;i&s;ters, left one daughter,
Devergilda, married to John Baliol, by whom &s;he had a
&s;on of the &s;ame name, one of the pre&s;ent candidates for
the crown: I&s;abella the &s;econd bore a &s;on, Robert Bruce,
who was now alive, and al&s;o in&s;i&s;ted on his claim;
Adama the third left a &s;on, John Ha&s;tings, who pretended
that the kingdom of Scotland, like many other inheri|tances,
was divi&s;ible among the three daughters of the
earl of Huntington, and that he, in the right of his
mother, had a title to the third of it. Baliol and Bruce
united again&s;t Ha&s;tings, in maintaining that the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
to the crown was impartible; but each of them,
&s;upported by plau&s;ible rca&s;ons, a&s;&s;erted the preference of
his own title. Baliol was &s;prung from the elder branch;
Bruce was one degree nearer the common &s;tock: If the
<PB N="253" REF="278">
right of repre&s;entation was regarded, the former had the
better claim: If propinquity was con&s;idered, the latter
was entitled to the preference<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Heming, vol. i. p. 36.</NOTE>: The &s;entiments of men
were divided: All the nobility had taken part with one
&s;ide or the other: The people followed implicitly their
leaders: The two canditates them&s;elves had great power
and numerous retainers in Scotland: And it is no wonder,
that among a rude people, more accu&s;tomed to arms than
enured to laws, a controver&s;y of this nature, which
could not be decided by any former precedent among
them, and which is capable of exciting commotions in
the mo&s;t legal and be&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed governments, &s;hould
threaten the &s;tate with the mo&s;t fatal convul&s;ions.</P>
<P>EACH age has its peculiar mode in conducting bu&s;ine&s;s;
and men, guided more by cu&s;tom than by rea&s;on, follow,
without enquiry, the manners, which are prevalent in
their own time. The pre&s;ent practice, in the contro|ver&s;ies
between &s;tates and princes, &s;eems to have been to
choo&s;e a foreign prince, as an equal arbiter, by whom
the que&s;tion was decided, and who&s;e &s;entence prevented
tho&s;e di&s;mal confu&s;ions and di&s;orders, in&s;eparable at all
times from war, but which were multiplied an hundred
fold, and di&s;per&s;ed into every corner, by the nature of
the feudal governments. It was thus that the Engli&s;h
king and barons, in the foregoing reign, had endeavoured
to compo&s;e their dome&s;tic di&s;&s;en&s;ions by a reference to the
King of France; and the celebrated integrity of that
monarch had prevented all the bad effects, which might
naturally have been dreaded from &s;o perilous an expe|dient.
It was thus, that the kings of France and Arragon,
and afterwards other princes, had &s;ubmitted their con|trover&s;ies
to Edward's judgment; and the remotene&s;s of
their &s;tates, the great power of the princes, and the lit|tle
intere&s;t, which he had on either &s;ide, had induced
him to acquit him&s;elf with honour in his deci&s;ions. The
<PB N="254" REF="279">
parliament of Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reference to Edward.</NOTE> therefore, threatened with a fu|rious
civil war, and allured by the great reputation of
the Engli&s;h monarch, as well as by the pre&s;ent amica|ble
corre&s;pondence between the kingdoms, agreed in
making a reference to Edward; and Fra&s;er, bi&s;hop of
St. Andrews, with other deputies, was &s;ent to notify to
him their re&s;olution, and to claim his good offices in the
pre&s;ent dangers to which they were expo&s;ed<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 31.</NOTE>. His in|clination,
they flattered them&s;elves, led him to prevent
their diffen&s;ions, and to interpo&s;e with a power, which
none of the candidates would dare to with&s;tand: When
this expedient was propo&s;ed by one party, the other
deemed it dangerous to object to it: Indifferent per&s;ons
thought that the imminent perils of a civil war would
thereby be prevented: And no one reflected on the ambi|tious
character of Edward, and the almo&s;t certain ruin,
which mu&s;t attend a &s;mall &s;tate, divided by factions, when
it thus implicitely &s;ubmits it&s;elf to the will of &s;o powerful
and encroaching a neighbour.</P>
<P>THE temptation was too &s;trong for the virtue of the
Engli&s;h monarch to re&s;i&s;t.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homage of Scotland.</NOTE> He propo&s;ed to lay hold of the
pre&s;ent favourable opportunity, and if not to create, at
lea&s;t to revive, his claim of a feudal &s;uperiority over Scot|land;
a claim which had hitherto lain in the deepe&s;t ob|&s;curity,
and which, if ever it had been an object of at|tention,
or had been &s;o much as &s;u&s;pected, would have
effectually prevented the Scotti&s;h barons from choo&s;ing
him for an umpire. He well knew, that, if this preten&s;ion
was once &s;ubmitted to, as it &s;eemed difficult in the pre|&s;ent
&s;ituation of Scotland to oppo&s;e it, the ab&s;olute &s;o|vereignty
of that kingdom, (which had been the ca&s;e
with Wales) would &s;oon follow; and that one great va&s;|&s;al,
cooped up in an i&s;land with his liege lord, without
re&s;ource from foreign powers, without aid from any fel|low
<PB N="255" REF="280">
va&s;&s;als, could not long maintain his dominions a|gain&s;t
the efforts of a mighty kingdom, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by all
the cavils which the feudal law afforded his &s;uperior
again&s;t him. In pur&s;uit of this great object, very ad|vantageous
to England, perhaps in the end no le&s;s be|neficial
to Scotland, but extremely unju&s;t and iniquitous
in it&s;elf, Edward bu&s;ied him&s;elf in &s;earching for proofs
of his pretended &s;uperiority; and in&s;tead of looking into
his own archives, which, if his claim had been real,
mu&s;t have afforded him numerous records of the ho|mages
paid by the Scotti&s;h princes, and could alone yield
him any authentic te&s;timony, he made all the mona&s;te|ries
be ran&s;acked for old chronicles and hi&s;tories wrote by
Engli&s;hmen, and he collected all the pa&s;&s;ages, which
&s;eemed any wi&s;e to favour his preten&s;ions<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing. p. 55.</NOTE>. Yet even
in this method of proceeding, which mu&s;t have di&s;covered
to him&s;elf the inju&s;tice of his claim, he was far from
being fortunate. He began his proofs from the time of
Edward the elder, and continued them thro' all the
Saxon and Norman times; but produced nothing to his
purpo&s;e<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 559.</NOTE>. The whole amount of his authorities during
the Saxon period, when &s;tripped of the bomba&s;t and in|accurate
&s;tyle of the monks, is, that the Scots had &s;ome|times
been defeated by the Engli&s;h, had received peace
on di&s;advantageous terms, had made &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to the
Engli&s;h monarch, and had even perhaps fallen into &s;ome
dependance on a power, which was &s;o much &s;uperior,
and which they had not at that time &s;ufficient force to
re&s;i&s;t. His authorities from the Norman period were, if
po&s;&s;ible, &s;till le&s;s conclu&s;ive: The hi&s;torians indeed make
frequent mention of an homage paid by the northern po|tentate;
but no one of them &s;ays that it was done for
his kingdom, and &s;everal of them declare, in expre&s;s
terms, that it was relative only to the fiefs which he en|joyed
<PB N="256" REF="281">
&s;outh of the Tweed<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 492. 662. M. Paris, p. 109. M. We&s;tm, p. 256.</NOTE>; in the &s;ame manner, as the
King of England him&s;elf &s;wore fealty to the French mo|narch,
for the fiefs, which he inherited in France. And
to &s;uch &s;candalous &s;hifts was Edward reduced, that he
quotes a paffage from Hoveden<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">P. 662.</NOTE>, where it is a&s;&s;erted,
that a Scotti&s;h King had done homage to England; but
he purpo&s;ely omits the latter part of the &s;ame &s;entence,
which expre&s;&s;es that this prince did homage for the lands,
which he held in England.</P>
<P>WHEN William, King of Scotland, was taken prifo|ner
in the battle of Alnwic, he was obliged, for the re|covery
of his liberty, to &s;wear fealty to the victor for
his crown it&s;elf. The deed was performed according to
all the rites of the &s;eudal law: The record was pre|&s;erved
in the Engli&s;h archives, as well as mentioned by
all the hi&s;torians: But as it is the only one of the kind,
and as hi&s;torians &s;peak of this &s;uperiority as a great ac|quifition
gained by the fortunate arms of Henry II.<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Neubr, lib. ii. cap, 4., Knyghton, p. 2392.</NOTE>
there can remain no doubt, that the kingdom of Scotland
was, in all former periods, entirely free and inde|pendant.
Its &s;ubjection continued a very few years:
King Richard, de&s;irous, before his departure for the Holy
Land, to conciliate the friend&s;hip of William, re|nounced
that homage, which he &s;ays in expre&s;s terms,
had been extorted by his father; and he only retained the
u&s;ual homage which had been done by the Scotti&s;h princes
for the lands, which they held in England.</P>
<P>BUT tho' this tran&s;action rendered the independance
of Scotland &s;till more unque&s;tionable, than if no fealty
had ever been &s;worn to the Engli&s;h crown; the Scotti&s;h
Kings, apprized of the point aimed at by their powerful
neighbours, &s;eem for a long time to have retained &s;ome
jealou&s;y on that head, and in doing homage, to have
anxiou&s;ly obviated all &s;uch preten&s;ions. When William
<PB N="257" REF="282">
in 1200 did homage to John at Lincoln, he was careful
to in&s;ert a &s;alvo for his royal dignity<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 811.</NOTE>: When Alexan|der

that this aid was only granted from friend|&s;hip,
not from any right claimed by the Engli&s;h mo|narch<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">vol. ii. p. 844.</NOTE>:
And when the &s;ame prince was invited to a&s;&s;i&s;t
at the coronation of this very Edward, he declined at|tendance,
till he received a like acknowledgment<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><P>Rymer, vol. ii. p. 216, 845. There cannot be the lea&s;t que&s;tion, that the homage u&s;ually paid by the kings of Scotland was not for their crown, but for &s;ome other territory. The only que&s;tion remains, what that territory was? It was not always for the earldom of Huntington, nor the honour of Penryth; becau&s;e we find it &s;ometimes done at a time when the&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions were not in the hands of the kings of Scotland. It is probable, that the homage was performed in general terms without any particular &s;pecification of territory; and this inaccuracy had pro|ceeded either from &s;ome di&s;pute between the two kings about the terri|tory and &s;ome oppo&s;ite claims, which were compromi&s;ed by the general homage, or from the &s;implicity of the age, which employed few words in every tran&s;action. To prove this we need but look into the letter of King Richard, where he re&s;igns the homage of Scotland, re&s;erving the u&s;ual homage. His words are, <HI>Sapedietus W. Rex ligius bomo no&s;ter deveniat de omnibus terris de quibus antece&s;&s;ores fui antece&s;&s;orum no&s;trorum ligli bomenes fuerunt, et nobis atque baeredibus no&s;tris fideletatem jurent.</HI> Rymer, vol. i. p. 65. The&s;e general terms were probably copied from the u&s;ual form of the homage it&s;elf.</P>
<P>It is no proof that the kings of Scotland po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no lands nor baro|nies in England, becau&s;e we cannot find them in the imperfect hi&s;tories and records of that age. For in&s;tance, it appears clearly from another pa&s;|&s;age of this very letter of Richard, that the Scotti&s;h King had lands both in the county of Huntington and el&s;ewhere in England; tho' the earl|dom of Huntington it&s;elf was then in the per&s;on of his brother, David; and we know at pre&s;ent of no other baronies, which William held. It cannot be expected that we &s;hould now be able to &s;pecify all his fees which he either po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed or claimed in England; when it is probable that the two monarchs them&s;elves and their mini&s;ters, would at that very time have differed in the lift: The Scotti&s;h King might po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome to which his right was d&s;puted; he might claim others, which he did not po&s;&s;e&s;s; And neither of the kings was willing to re&s;ign his preten&s;ions by a particular enumeration.</P>
<P>A late author of great indu&s;try and learning, but full of prejudices, and of no penetration, Mr. Carte, has taken advantage of the undefined terms of the Scots homage, and has pretended that it was done for Lothian and Galloway, that is, all the territories of the country now called Scotland, lying &s;outh of the Clyde and Forth. But to refute this preten&s;ion at once, we need only con&s;ider, that if the&s;e territories were held in fee of the Engli&s;h kings, there would, by the nature of the feudal law as e&s;tabli&s;hed in England, have been continual appeals from them to the courts of the lord Paramont; contrary to all the hi|&s;tories and records of that age. We find, that, as &s;oon as Edward really e&s;tabli&s;hed his &s;uperiority, appeals immediately commenced from all parts of Scotland: And that King, in his writ to the King's bench, con&s;iders them as a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of the feudal tenure. Such large territories al&s;o would have &s;upplied a con&s;iderable part of the Engli&s;h armies, which never could have e&s;caped all the hi&s;torians. Not to mention that there is not any in&s;tance of a Scots pri&s;oner of war being tried as a rebel, in the many ho&s;tilities between the kingdoms, Where the Scots armies were chiefly filled from the &s;outhern counties.</P>
<P>Mr. Carte's notion with regard to Galloway, which comprehends, in the language of that age, or rather in that of the preceding, mo&s;t of the &s;outh We&s;t counties of Scotland; his notion, I &s;ay, re&s;ts on &s;o &s;light a foundation, that it &s;carce merits being refuted. He will have it (and merely becau&s;e he will have it) that the Cumberland, yielded by King Edmund to Malcolm I. meant not only the county in England of that name, but all the territory northwards to the Clyde. But the ca&s;e of Lothian de&s;erves &s;ome more consideration.</P>
<P>It is certain, that in very antient language, Scotland means only the country north of the firths of Clyde and Forth. I &s;hall not make a parade of literature to prove it; becau&s;e I do not find that this point is di&s;puted by the Scots them&s;elves. The fouthern country was divided into Galloway and Lothian; and the latter comprehended all the fouth ea&s;t counties. This territory was certainly a part of the ancient king|dom of Northumberland, and was entirely peopled by Saxons, who af|terwards received a great mixture of Danes among them. It appears from all the Engli&s;h hi&s;tories, that the whole kingdom of Northumber|land paid very little obedience to the Saxon monarchs, who governed after the di&s;&s;olution of the heptarchy; and the northern and remote parts of it &s;eem to have fallen into a kind of anarchy, fometimes pillag|ed by the Danes, and &s;ometimes concurring with them in their ravages upon other parts of England. The kings of Scotland, lying nearer them, took at laft po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country, which had &s;carce any go|vernment, and we are told by Matthew of We&s;tmin&s;ter, p. 193, that King Edgar made a grant of the territory to Kenneth III. that is, he re&s;igned claims, which he could not make effectual, Without be&s;towing on them more trouble and expence than they were worth: For the&s;e are the only grants of provinces made by kings; and &s;o ambitious and active a prince as Edgar would never have given pre&s;ents of any other kind. Tho' Matthew of We&s;tmin&s;ter's authority may appear &s;mall with regard to &s;o remote a tran&s;action; yet we may admit it in this ca&s;e, becau&s;e Ordericus Vitalis, a very good authority, tells us, p. 701. that Malcolm acknowledged to William Ru&s;us, that the conqueror had confirmed to him the former grant of Lothian. But it follows not, becau&s;e Edgar made this &s;pecies of grant to Kenneth, that therefore he exacted homage for that territory. Homage and all the rites of the feu|dal law were very little known to the Saxons; and we may al&s;o &s;uppo&s;e, that the claim of Edgar was &s;o antiquated and weak, that in re&s;igning it, he made no very valuable conce&s;tion, and Kenneth might well refu&s;e to hold, by &s;o precarious a tenure, a territory, which he at pre&s;ent held by the &s;word. In &s;hort, no author &s;ays, he did homage for it.</P>
<P>The only colour indeed of authority for Mr Carte's notion is, that Matthew Paris, who wrote in the reign of Henry III. before Edward's claim of &s;uperiority was heard of, &s;ays that Alexander III. did homage to Henry III. <HI>pro Laudiano et aliis terris.</HI> See page 555. This word &s;eems naturally to be interpreted Lothian. But in the fir&s;t place, Matthew Paris's te&s;timony, tho' con&s;iderable, will not outweigh that of all the other hi&s;torians, who &s;ay that the Scots homage was always done for lands in England. Secondly, if the Scots homage was done in general terms (as has been already proved) it is no Wonder that hi&s;to|rians &s;hould differ in their account of the object of it, fince the parties them&s;elves were not fully agreed. Thirdly, there is rea&s;on to think that <HI>Laudianum</HI> in Matthew Paris does not mean Lothian in Scotland. There appears to have been a territory, which antiently bore that or a &s;imilar name, in the north of England, For (I) The Saxon Chro|nicle, p. 197, &s;ays that Malcolm Kenmure met William Rufus in Lo|dene in England. (2) It is agreed by all the hi&s;torians, that Henry II. only reconquered from Scotland the northern counties of Northumberland, Cumberland, and We&s;tmorland. See Newbriggs, p. 383. Wykes, p. 30. Hemingford, p. 492. Yet the fame country is called by other hiftorians Loidis, comitatus Lodonen&s;is, or &s;ome &s;uch name. See M. Paris, p. 68. M. We&s;t. p. 247. Annal. Waverl. p. 159. and Diceto, p. 531. (3) This la&s;t mentioned author, when he &s;peaks of Lothian in Scotland, calls it Loheneis, p. 574. tho' he had called the Engli&s;h territory Loidis. (4) King David's charter to the church of Durham, begins with this pa&s;&s;age. <HI>Omnibus Scotis &amp; Anglis, tam in Scotia, quam in Ledoneis con&s;titutis,</HI> &amp;c. See Spellman Glo&s;s. in verbo <HI>Scotia.</HI> Whence we may learn, that the province of <HI>Lodoneium</HI> was not only &s;ituated &s;outh of the Tweed, but al&s;o extended beyond Durham, and made a part of England.</P>
<P>I thought this long note requi&s;ite in order to correct Mr. Carte's mi|&s;take, an author who&s;e diligence and indu&s;try has given light to many pa&s;&s;ages of the more antient Engli&s;h hi&s;tory.</P></NOTE>.</P>

He then produced his proofs of this &s;uperiority,
which he pretended to be unque&s;tionable, and he required
of them an acknowledgment of it; a demand, which
was &s;uper&s;iuous if the fact was already known and avowed,
and which plainly betrays Edward's con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his
lame and defective title. The Scots parliament were a&s;to|ni&s;hed
at &s;o new a preten&s;ion, and an&s;wered only by
their &s;ilence. But the King, in order to maintain the
appearance of free and regular proceedings, de&s;ired them
to remove into their own country, to deliberate upon
his claim, to examine his proofs, to propo&s;e all their ob|jections,
and then to inform him of their re&s;olutions:
And he appointed a plain at Up&s;ettleton, on the northern
banks of the Tweed, for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>WHEN the Scotti&s;th barons a&s;&s;embled in this place, tho'
moved with indignation at the inju&s;tice of this unex|pected
claim, and at the fraud with which it had been
conducted, they found them&s;elves betrayed into a fitua|tion,
in which it was impo&s;&s;ible for them to make any
defence for the ancient liberty and independence of their
country. The King of England, a martial and politic
<PB N="262" REF="287">

di&s;tance, and was only &s;eparated from them by a river

of them might them&s;elves be able to make their e&s;cape;
what hopes could they entertain of fecuring the king|dom
again&s;t his future enterprizes? Without a head,
without union among them&s;elves, attached all of them

to the deci&s;ion of this foreign u&s;urper, and who
were thereby reduced to an ab&s;olute dependance upon
him; they could only expect by re&s;i&s;tance to entail on
them&s;elves and their po&s;terity a more grievous and more
de&s;tructive fervitude. Yet even in this de&s;perate &s;tate
of their affairs, the Scotti&s;h barons, as we learn from
Wal&s;ingham<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">56. M. We&s;t, p. 436. It is &s;aid by Hemingford, vol. i. p. 33. that the King menaced violently the scots barons, and forced them to compliance, at lea&s;t to &s;ilence.</NOTE>, one of the be&s;t hi&s;torians of that period,
had the courage to reply, that till they had a king, they
could take no re&s;olution on &s;o momentous a point:
The journal of King Edward &s;ays, that they made no
an&s;wer at all<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 548.</NOTE>: That is, perhaps, no <HI>particular</HI> an&s;wer
or objection to Edward's claim: And by this &s;olution
it is po&s;&s;ble to reconcile the journal with the hi&s;torian.
The king, therefore, interpreting their &s;ilence as a con|fent,
addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the feveral competitors, and
previou&s;ly to his pronouncing &s;entence, required their
acknowledgement of his &s;uperiority.</P>

from more remote branches of the royal family;
others were even &s;prung from illegitimate children; and
as none of them had the le&s;d pretence of right, it is
natural to conjecture, that Edward had fecretly encou|raged
them to appear in the lift of claimants, that he
might &s;ow the more divi&s;ions among the Scotti&s;h nobility,
make the cau&s;e appear the more intricate, and be able to

Robert Bruce was the fir&s;t who acknowledged
Edward's right of &s;uperiority over Scotland; and he had
&s;o far forefeen the King's preten&s;ions, that even in his

a &s;tep which was not taken by any of the other
candidates<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 577, 578, 579.</NOTE>. They all, however, with &s;eeming willing|ne&s;s

was the la&s;t who recognized the King's title<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 546.</NOTE>. Edward
next deliberated concerning the method of proceeding
in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this great controver&s;y. He appointed,

as adhered to him, &s;hould choo&s;e forty commi&s;&s;ion|ers;
Bruce and his adherents other forty: To the&s;e

cau&s;e deliberately among them&s;elves, and make their re|port
to him<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 555, 556.</NOTE>: And he promi&s;ed in the en&s;uing year to

and this exorbitant demand was complied with, both by
the &s;tates and the candidates<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 529. Walfin. p. 56, 57.</NOTE>. The governors al&s;o of
all the ca&s;tles immediately re&s;igned their command;
except Umfreville earl of Angus, who refu&s;ed, without a
formal acquittal from the parliament and the &s;everal claim|ants,
to &s;urrender his fortre&s;&s;es to &s;uch a domineering
arbiter, who had given to Scotland &s;o many ju&s;t rea&s;ons
of &s;u&s;picion<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 531.</NOTE>. Before this a&s;&s;embly broke up, which
had fixed &s;uch a mark of di&s;honour on the nation, all the
prelates and barons there pre&s;ent &s;wore fealty to Edward;

oath of all the other barons and per&s;ons of di&s;tinction in,
Scotland<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Rymsr, vol. ii, p. 573.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King having finally made, as he imagined, this im|portant
acqui&s;ition, left the commi&s;&s;ioners to fit at Berwick,
and examine the titles of the &s;everal candidates, who claim|ed
the precarious crown, which Edward was willing for
&s;ome time to allow the lawful heir to enjoy. He went
fouthwards, both in order to affift at the funerals of his
mother. Queen Eleanor, who died about this time, and
to compo&s;e &s;ome differences which had arifen among his
principal nobility. Gilbert earl of Glocefter, the great|e&s;t

baron of the kingdom, had e&s;pou&s;ed the King's daugh|ter;
and being elated by that alliance, and &s;till more by
his own exorbitant power, which, he thought, &s;et him
above the laws, he permitted his bailiffs and va&s;&s;als to
commit violences on the lands of Humphrey Bohun earl
of Hereford, who retaliated the injury by like violences.
But this was not a reign in which &s;uch illegal proceedings
could pa&s;s with impunity. Edward procured a &s;entence
again&s;t the two earls, committed them both to pri&s;on,
and would not re&s;tore them to their liberty, till he exact|ed
a fine of 1000 merks from Hereford, and one of
10,000 from his &s;on-in-law.</P>
<P>DURING this interval,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1292.</NOTE> the titles of John Baliol and

founded among the competitors to the crown of Scotland,
were the &s;ubject of general di&s;qui&s;ition, as well as of
debate among the commi&s;&s;ioners. Edward, in order to
give greater authority to his intended deci&s;ion, propo&s;ed
this general que&s;tion both to the a&s;&s;embly, and to all the
celebrated lawyers in Europe; Whether a per&s;on de|&s;cended
from the elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, but farther removed by one
degree, was preferable in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of kingdoms,
fiefs, and other impartible inheritances, to one de&s;cended
from the younger &s;i&s;ter, but one degree nearer the
common &s;tock? This was the true &s;tate of the ca&s;e; and
the right of repre&s;entation had now gained &s;uch ground
every where, that an uniform an&s;wer was returned to
the King in the affirmative. He therefore pronounced
&s;entence in favour of Baliol; and when Bruce, upon
this di&s;appointment, joined afterwards lord Ha&s;tings, and
claimed a third of the kingdom, which he now pretend|ed
to be divi&s;ible, Edward, tho' the intere&s;ts of his am|bition
&s;eemed more to require the partition of Scotland,
again pronounced &s;entence in favour of Baliol. That
candidate, upon renewing his oath of fealty to England,

was put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the kingdom<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 590, 591, 593, 600.</NOTE>; all his fortre&s;&s;es

of that claim was apparent, and was aggravated by
the mo&s;t egregious breach of tru&s;t, he might have fixed
his preten&s;ions, and have left that important acqui&s;ition
to his po&s;terity: But he immediately proceeded in &s;uch a
manner, as made it apparent, that, not contented with
this u&s;urpation, he aimed al&s;o at the ab&s;olute &s;overeignty
and dominion of the kingdom. In&s;tead of gradually
enuring the Scots to bear the yoke, and exerting his
rights of &s;uperiority with moderation, he encouraged all
appeals to England; required King John him&s;elf, by fix
different &s;ummons on trivial occa&s;ions, to come to London<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 603, 605, 606, 608, 615, 616.</NOTE>;

by a procurator; and obliged him to appear at the bar of

the dominion of the &s;tate as the puni&s;hment of his trea|&s;on

&s;oft and gentle &s;pirit, returned into Scotland highly prov|oked
at this u&s;age, and determined at all hazards to
vindicate his liberty; and the war, which &s;oon after
broke out between France and England, gave him a fa|vourable
opportunity for executing his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>THE violences,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with France.</NOTE> robberies and di&s;orders, to which
that age was &s;o &s;ubject, were not con$ined to the licenti|ous
barons and their retainers at land: The &s;ea was

the laws had given licence to all orders of men: And a
general appetite for rapine and revenge, &s;upported by a
fal&s;e point of honour, had al&s;o infected the merchants
and mariners, and pu&s;hed them, on any provocation, to
&s;eek redre&s;s, by immediate retaliation upon the aggre&s;|&s;ors.
A Norman and Engli&s;h &s;hip met off the coa&s;t near

they &s;ent their boats to land, and the &s;everal crews came
at the fame time to the &s;ame &s;pring: There en&s;ued a
quarrel for the preference: A Norman, drawing his dag|ger,
attempted to &s;tab an Engli&s;hman; who, grappling
with him, threw his adver&s;ary on the ground; and the
Norman, as was pretended, falling on his own dagger, was
&s;lain<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;in. p. 58. Heming, vol. i. p. 39.</NOTE>. This &s;cuffle between two &s;eamen about water,

mariners of the Norman &s;hip carried their complaints to
the French King: Philip, without enquiring into the
truth, without a&s;king for redre&s;s, bid them take revenge,
and trouble him no more about the matter<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Walfin. p. 58.</NOTE>. The Nor|mans,
who had been more regular than u&s;ual in applying
to the crown, needed but this hint to proceed to immedi|ate
violence. They &s;eized an Engli&s;h &s;hip in the chan|nel;
and hanging, along with &s;ome dogs, &s;everal; of the
crew on the yard-arm, in prefence of their companions,
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the ve&s;&s;el<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 40. M. We&s;t. p. 419.</NOTE>; and bad the mariners inform their
countrymen, that vengeance was now taken for the
blood of the Norman killed at Bayonne. This injury,
accompanied by &s;o general and deliberate an in&s;ult, was
re&s;ented by the mariners of the cinque ports, who, with|out
carrying any complaints to the King, or waiting for
redre&s;s, retaliated by committing like barbarities on all
French ve&s;&s;els without di&s;tinction. The French, pro|voked
by their lo&s;&s;es, preyed on the &s;hips of all Edward's
&s;ubjects, whether Engli&s;h or Ga&s;con: The &s;ea became
a &s;cene of pyracy between the nations: The &s;overeigns,
without either &s;econding or repre&s;&s;ing the violence of
their &s;ubjects, &s;eemed to continue indifferent &s;pectators:
The Engli&s;h made private a&s;&s;ociations with the Iri&s;h and
Dutch &s;eamen; the French with the Flemi&s;h and
Genoe&s;e<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 40.</NOTE>: And the animo&s;ities of the people on both
&s;ides became every day more violent and barbarous. A
fleet of two hundred Norman ve&s;&s;els &s;et &s;ail to the &s;outh
for wine and other commodities; and in their pa&s;&s;age,
&s;eized all the Engli&s;h &s;hips which they met with; hanged
the &s;eamen, and &s;eized the goods. The inhabitants of the
Engli&s;h &s;ea ports, informed of this event, fitted out a
fleet of &s;ixty &s;ail, &s;tronger and better manned than the
others; and awaited the enemy on their return. After

on this occa&s;ion amounted to 15,000 men: Which is
accounted for by this circum&s;tance, that the Norman
fleet was employed in tran&s;porting a con&s;iderable body of
&s;oldiers from the &s;outh.</P>
<P>THE affair was now become too important to be any
longer overlooked by the princes. On Philip's &s;ending
an envoy to demand reparation and re&s;titution, the King
di&s;patched the bi&s;hop of London to the French court, in
order to accommodate the quarrel. He fir&s;t &s;aid, that
the Engli&s;h courts of ju&s;tice were open to all men; and
if any Frenchman were injured, he might &s;eek repara|tion

the King of France, or by a reference either to the Pope
or the college of cardinals, or any particular cardinals,
agreed on by both parties<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. 275.</NOTE>. The French, probably
the more di&s;gu&s;ted, as they were hitherto lo&s;ers in the
quarrel, refu&s;ed all the&s;e expedients: The ve&s;&s;els and the
goods of merchants were confi&s;cated on both &s;ides: De|predations
were continued by the Ga&s;cons on all the
we&s;tern coa&s;ts of France, as well as by the Engli&s;h in

to appear in his court at Paris, and an&s;wer for the&s;e of|fences:
And Edward, apprehen&s;ive of danger to that
province, &s;ent John St. John, an experienced &s;oldier,

<P>THAT he might however prevent a final rupture be|tween
the nations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1294.</NOTE> the King di&s;patched his brother, Ed|mond,

Earl of Lanca&s;ter, to Paris; and as that prince
had e&s;pou&s;ed the Queen of Navarre, mother to Jane
Queen of France, he &s;eemed, on account of that alliance,
the mo&s;t proper per&s;on for finding expedients to accom|modate
the difference, Jane pretended to interpo&s;e with
her good offices: Mary, the Queen-dowager, feigned
the fame amicable di&s;po&s;ition: And the&s;e two prince&s;&s;es
told Edmond, that the circum&s;tance, the mo&s;t difficult to
adju&s;t, was the point of honour with Philip, who thought
him&s;elf affronted by the injuries committed again&s;t him
by his &s;ub-va&s;&s;als in Guienne: But if once Edward
would con&s;ent to give him &s;eizin and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that
province, he would think his honour fully repaired,
would engage to re&s;tore it immediately, and would ac|cept
of a very ea&s;y &s;atisfaction for all the other injuries.
The King was con&s;ulted on this occa&s;ion, and as he then
found him&s;elf in immediate danger of war with the Scots,
which he regarded as the more important concern, this
politic prince, blinded by his favourite pa&s;&s;ion for &s;ubdu|ing
that nation, allowed him&s;elf to be deceived by &s;o
gro&s;s an artifice<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 619, 620. Walfin. p. 61. Heming. vol. i, p. 42, 43. Trivet, p. 277.</NOTE>. He &s;ent his brother orders to &s;ign

accordingly recalled: But the French monarch was no
&s;ooner put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Guienne, than the citation

<P>EDWARD, fallen into a like &s;nare with that which he
had &s;pread for the Scots, was enraged; and the more &s;o,
as he was ju&s;tly a&s;hamed of his own conduct, in being &s;o
<PB N="271" REF="296">
egregiou&s;fly over&ndash;reached by the court of France. Sen&s;i|ble
of the extreme difficulties, which he would encounter
in the recovery of Ga&s;cony, where he had not retained a
&s;ingle place in his hands; he endeavoured to compen&s;ate
that lo&s;s, by forming alliances with &s;everal European
princes, who, he propo&s;ed, &s;hould attack France on all
quarters, and make a diver&s;ion of her forces. Adolphus
de Na&s;&s;au, King of the Romans, entered into a treaty
with him for that purpo&s;e<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 51.</NOTE> as did al&s;o Amad$us, count
of Savoy, the archbi&s;hop of Cologne, the counts of
Gueldre and Luxembourg; the duke of Brabant and
count of Barre, who had married his two daughters,
Margaret and Eleanor: But the&s;e alliances were ex|tremely
burden&s;ome on his narrow revenues, and proved
in the i&s;&s;ue entirely ineffectual. More impre&s;&s;ion was
made on Guienne by an Engli&s;h army, which he com|pleated
by emptying the jails of many thou&s;and thieves
and robbers, who had been confined there for their
crimes. So low had the profe&s;&s;ion of arms fallen, and
&s;o much had it degenerated from the footing, on which
it &s;tood during the vigour of the feudal &s;y&s;tem!</P>
<P>THE King him&s;elf was detained in England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1295.</NOTE> fir&s;t by
contrary winds<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Chron. Dun&s;t. vol. ii. p. 622.</NOTE>, then by his apprehen&s;ions of a Scots

repre&s;&s;ed and brought again under &s;ubjection<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Walfing. p 62. Heming. vol. i. p. 55. Trivet, p. 282. Chron. Dun&s;t. vol. ii. p. 622.</NOTE>. The
army, which he &s;ent to Guienne, was commanded by
his nephew, John de Bretagne, earl of Richmond, and
under him by St. John, Tibetot, de Vere, and other
officers of reputation<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p, 279.</NOTE>; who made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of
the town of Bayonne, as well as of Bourg, Blaye,
Rions, St. Severe, and other places, which &s;traitened
Bourdeaux, and cut off its communication both by &s;ea

and land. The favour, which the Ga&s;con nobility bore
to the Engli&s;h government, facilitated the&s;e conque&s;ts,
and &s;eemed to promi&s;e &s;till greater &s;ucce&s;&s;es; but this
advantage was &s;oon lo&s;t by the mi&s;conduct of &s;ome of
the officers. Philip's brother, Charles de Valois, who
commanded the French armies, having laid &s;iege to Po|den&s;ac,
a &s;mall fortre&s;s near Rions, obliged Gi&s;&s;ard, the
governor, to capitulate; and the articles, tho' favourable
to the Engli&s;h, left all the Ga&s;cons pri&s;oners at di&s;cre|tion,
of whom about fifty were hanged by Charles as re|bels:
A policy, by which he both intimidated that peo|ple,
and produced an irreparable breach between them
and the Engli&s;h<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 49.</NOTE>. That prince immediately attacked
Rions, where the earl of Richmond him&s;elf commanded;
and as the place &s;eemed not very defen&s;ible, the Engli&s;h
general drew his troops to the water-&s;ide with an inten|tion
of embarking with the greate&s;t part of the army.
The enraged Ga&s;cons fell upon his rear, and at the &s;ame
time opened their gates to the French, who, be&s;ides
making them&s;elves matters of the place, took many pri|&s;oners
of di&s;tinction. St. Severe was more vigorou&s;ly
defended by Hugh de Vere, &s;on to the earl of Oxford;
but was at la&s;t obliged to capitulate. The French King,
not contented with the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es in Ga&s;cony, threaten|ed
England with an inva&s;ion; and by a &s;udden attempt,
his troops took and burnt Dover<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. 284. Chron, Dun&s;t. vol. ii. p. 642.</NOTE>, but were obliged &s;oon
after to retire. And in order to make a greater diver&s;ion
of the Engli&s;h force, and engage Edward in dangerous
and important wars, he formed a &s;ecret alliance with
John Baliol, King of Scotland; the commencement of
that &s;trict: union, which, during &s;o many ages, was
maintained, by mutual intere&s;ts and nece&s;&s;ities, between
the French and Scotti&s;h nations. John confirmed this
<PB N="273" REF="298">
alliance by &s;tipulating a marriage between his elde&s;t &s;on

<P>THE expences,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Digre&s;&s;ion concerning the con&s;ti|tution of paliament.</NOTE> attending the&s;e multiplied wars of Ed|ward,
and his preparations for war, joined to altera|tions,
which had in&s;en&s;ibly taken place in the general
&s;tate of affairs, obliged him to have frequent recour&s;e to
parliamentary &s;upplies, introduced the lower orders of
the &s;tate into the publick councils, and laid the founda|tions
of great and important changes in the government.
Tho' nothing could be wor&s;e calculated for cultivating
the arts of peace or maintaining peace it&s;elf, than the
long &s;ubordination of va&s;&s;alage from the King to the
meane&s;t gentleman, and the con&s;equent &s;lavery of the
lower people, evils in&s;eparable from the feudal &s;y&s;tem;
that &s;y&s;tem was never able to fix the &s;tate in a proper
warlike po&s;ture, or give it the full exertion of its power
for defence, and &s;till le&s;s for offence, again&s;t a public
enemy. The military tenants, unacquainted with obe|dience,
unexperienced in war, held a rank in the troops
by their birth, not by their merits or &s;ervices; compo&s;ed
a very di&s;orderly and con&s;equently a very feeble army;
and during the few days, which they were obliged by
their tenures to remain in the field, were often more formi|dable
to their own prince than to foreign powers, again&s;t
whom they were a&s;&s;embled. The &s;overeigns came gra|dually
to di&s;u&s;e this cumber&s;ome and dangerous machine,
&s;o apt to recoil upon the hand which held it; and ex|changing
the military &s;ervice for pecuniary &s;upplies, in|li$ted
forces by means of a contract with particular offi|cers,
(&s;uch as tho&s;e the Italians denominate <HI>Condottieri</HI>)
whom they di&s;mi&s;&s;ed at the end of the war. The barons
and knights them&s;elves often entered into the&s;e en|gagements
with the prince, and were enabled to fill their
<PB N="274" REF="299">
bands, both by the authority which they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed over
their va&s;&s;als and tenants, and from the great numbers of
loo&s;e, di&s;orderly people, whom they found on their
e&s;tates, and who willingly embraced an opportunity of
gratifying their appetite for war and rapine. Mean|while,
the old Gothic fabric, being neglected, went
gradually to decay; and tho' the conqueror had divided
all the lands of England into &s;ixty thou&s;and knight's fees,
the number of the&s;e was in&s;en&s;ibly dimini&s;hed by various
artifices; and the King at la&s;t found, that, by putcing
the law in execution, he could a&s;&s;emble only a very &s;mall
part of the antient force of the kingdom. It was an
u&s;ual expedient for men, who held of the King or a great
baron by military tenure, to transfer their land to the
church, and receive them back by another tenure called
frankalmoigne, by which they were not bound to per|form
any &s;ervice<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Madox's Baronia Anglica, p. 114.</NOTE>. A law was made again&s;t this prac|tice;
but the abu&s;e had probably gone far before it was
attended to, and probably was not entirety corrected by
the new &s;tatute, which, like mo&s;t of the laws of that
age, we may conjecture to have been but feebly executed
by the magi&s;trate again&s;t the perpetual intere&s;ts of &s;o ma|ny
individuals. The con&s;table and mare&s;chal, when
they mu&s;tered the armies, often in a hurry, and for want
of better information, received the &s;ervice of a baron
for fewer knight's fees, than were due by him; and one
precedent of this kind was held good again&s;t the King,
and became ever after a rea&s;on for dimini&s;hing the &s;er|vice<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Madox's Baronia Anglica, p. 115.</NOTE>.
The rolls of knight's fees were very inaccurately
kept; no care was taken to clear them before the armies
were &s;ummoned into the field<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">We hear only of one King, Henry II. who took this pains; and the record, called Liber niger Scaccarii, was the re&s;ult of it.</NOTE>; it was then too late to

was accepted on the footing which the va&s;&s;al him&s;elf was
plea&s;ed to acknowledge, after all the various &s;ubdivi&s;ions
and conjunctions of property had thrown an ob&s;curity on
the nature and extent of his tenure<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Madox, Bar. Ang. p. 116.</NOTE>. It is ea&s;y to judge
of the intricacies which would attend di&s;putes of this
kind with individuals; when even the number of military
fees, belonging to the church, who&s;e property was fixed
and unalienable, became the &s;ubject of controver&s;y; and
we find in particular, that when the bi&s;hop of Durham
was charged with &s;eventy knights fees for the aid levied
to marry Henry II's daughter to the duke of Saxony, the
prelate acknowledged ten, and di&s;owned the other &s;ixty<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Madox, Bar. Ang. p, 112. Hi&s;t. of the Exch. p. 404.</NOTE>.
It is not known in what manner this difference was ter|minated;
but had the que&s;tion been concerning an ar|mament
to defend the kingdom, the bi&s;hop's &s;ervice
would probably have been received without oppo&s;ition for
ten fees, and this rate mu&s;t al&s;o have fixed all his future
payments. Pecuniary &s;cutages, therefore, dimini&s;hed as much as
military &s;ervices<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">order to pay the fum of 100,000 marks, as King Richard's ran|&s;om, twenty &s;hillings were impo&s;ed on each knight's fee. Had the fees remained on the original footing, as &s;ettled by the conqueror, this &s;cutage would have amounted to 90,000 marks, which was nearly the &s;um required: But we find, that many other grievous taxes were im|po&s;ed to complete it: A certain proof, that many frauds and abu&s;es had prevailed in the roll of knights fees.</NOTE>: Other methods of filling the
exchequer as well as the armies mu&s;t be devi&s;ed: New
&s;ituations produced new laws and in&s;titutions: And the
great alterations in the finances and military power of the
crown, as well as in private property, were the &s;ource of
equal innovations in every part of the legi&s;lature or ci|vil
government.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="301">
THE exorbitant e&s;tates, conferred by the Norman, on
his barons and chieftains, remained not long entire and
unimpaired. The landed property was gradually &s;hared
out into more hands; and tho&s;e immen&s;e baronies were
divided, either by provi&s;ions to younger children, by par|titions
among co-heirs, by &s;ale, or by e&s;cheating to the
King, who gratified a great number of his courtiers, by
dealing them out among them in &s;maller portions. Such
moderate e&s;tates, as they required oeconomy, and con|fined
the proprietors to their own hou&s;es, were better
calculated for duration; and the order of knights and
&s;mall barons grew daily more numerous, and began to
form a very re&s;pectable rank or order in the &s;tate. As
they were all of them immediate va&s;&s;als of the crown by
military tenure, they were, from the principles of the feudal
law, equally intitled with the greate&s;t barons, to a &s;eat
in the national or general councils; and this right, tho'
regarded as a privilege, which the owners would not en|tirely
relinqui&s;h, was al&s;o con&s;idered as a burthen, which
they de&s;ired to be &s;ubjected to only on extraordinary oc|ca&s;ions.
Hence it was provided in the charter of King
John, that, while the great barons were &s;ummoned to
the general council by a particular writ, the &s;mall barons,
under which appellation the knights were al&s;o compre|hended,
&s;hould only be called by a general &s;ummons of
the &s;heriff. The di&s;tinction between great and &s;mall
barons, like that between rich and poor, was not ex|actly
defined; but, agreeable to the inaccurate genius of
that age and to the &s;implicity of antient government, was
left very much to be determined by the di&s;cretion of
the King and his mini&s;ters. It was u&s;ual for the prince
to require, by a particular &s;ummons, the attendance of a
baron in one parliament, and to neglect him in future
<PB N="277" REF="302">
parliaments<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Chancellor We&s;t's enquiry into the manner of creating peers, p. 43. 46, 47. 55.</NOTE>; nor was this uncertainty ever complained
of as an injury. He attended when required: He was
better plea&s;ed on other occa&s;ions to be exempted from the
burthen: And as he was acknowledged to be of the &s;ame
order with the greate&s;t barons, it gave them no &s;urprize
to &s;ee him take his &s;eat in the great councils, whether he
appeared of his own accord, or by a particular &s;ummons
from the king. The barons by <HI>Writ,</HI> therefore, began
gradually to intermix them&s;elves with the ancient barons
from <HI>Tenure;</HI> and as Camden tells us<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">In Britann. p. 122.</NOTE>, from an ancient
manu&s;cript, now lo&s;t, that after the battle of Eve&s;ham,
a po&s;itive law was enacted, prohibiting every baron to
appear in parliament, who was not invited thither by a
particular &s;ummons, the whole baronage of England held
thenceforward their &s;eat by writ, and this important
privilege of their tenures was in effect: aboli&s;hed. Only
where writs had been regularly continued for &s;ome time
in one great family, the omi&s;&s;ion of them would have
been regarded as an affront, and even as an injury.</P>
<P>A LIKE alteration gradually took place in the order of
earls, who were the highe&s;t rank of barons. The dignity
of an earl, like that of a baron, was antiently territorial
and official<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Spellm. Glo&s;&s;. in voce <HI>Comis.</HI></NOTE>: He exerci&s;ed juri&s;diction within his
county: He levied the third of the fines to his own profit:
He was at once a civil and a military magi&s;trate: And
tho' his authority, from the fir&s;t conque&s;t of the Nor|mans,
was hereditary in England, the title was &s;o much
connected with the office, that where the King intended
to create a new earl, he had no other expedient than to
erect a certain territory into a county or earldom, and
<PB N="278" REF="303">
to be&s;tow it upon the per&s;on and his Family<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ays on Briti&s;h antiquities. This practice, however, &s;eems to have been more familiar in Scotland and the kingdoms on the con|tinent, than in England.</NOTE>. But as
the &s;heriffs, who were the vice-gerents of the earls,
were named by the King, and removeable at plea&s;ure, he
found them more dependant upon him; and endeavoured
to throw the whole authority and juri&s;diction of the office
into their hands. This magi&s;trate was at the head of the
finances, and levied all the King's rents within his
county: He a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at plea&s;ure the talliages of the inha|bitants
in royal deme&s;ne: He had u&s;ually committed to
him the management of wards and often of e&s;cheats: He
pre&s;ided in the lower courts of judicature: And thus,
tho' inferior to the earl in dignity, he was &s;oon con|&s;idered,
by this union of the judicial and fi&s;cal powers,
and by the confidence repo&s;ed in him by the King, as
much &s;uperior to him in authority, and undermined his
influence within his own juri&s;diction<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">There are in&s;tances of princes of the blood who accepted of the of|$oc of &s;heriff. Spellman in voce <HI>Vicecomis.</HI></NOTE>. It became u&s;ual,
in creating an earl, to give him a fixt &s;allary, commonly
about twenty pounds a year, in lieu of his third of the
fines: The diminution of his power kept pace with the
retrenchment of his profit: And the dignity of earl, in|&s;tead
of territorial and official, dwindled into per&s;onal
and titular. Such were the mighty alterations, which
had already fully taken place, or were gradually advan|cing,
in the hou&s;e of peers; that is, in the parliament:
For there was antiently no other hou&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the introduction of barons by writ, and of
titular earls, had given &s;ome encrea&s;e to the royal autho|rity;
there were other cau&s;es, which counterballanced
tho&s;e innovations, and tended in a higher degree to di|mini&s;h
the power of the &s;overeign. The di$u&s;e, into
<PB N="279" REF="304">
which the feudal militia had in a great mea&s;ure fallen,
made the barons almo&s;t entirely forget their dependence
on the crown: By the diminution of the number of
knights fees, the King had no rea&s;onable compen&s;ation
when he levied &s;cutages and exchanged their &s;ervices for
money: The alienations of the crown lands had reduced
him to poverty: And above all, the conce&s;&s;ion of the
great charter had &s;et bounds to royal authority, and had
rendered it more difficult and dangerous for the prince to
exert any extraordinary acts of arbitrary power. In
this &s;ituation it was natural for the King to court the
friend&s;hip of the le&s;&s;er barons and knights, who&s;e in|fluence
was nowi&s;e dangerous to him, and who, being
expo&s;ed to oppre&s;&s;ion from their powerful neighbours,
&s;ought a legal protection under the &s;hadow of the throne.
He de&s;ired, therefore, to have their pre&s;ence in parlia|ment,
where they &s;erved to controul the turbulent re&s;o|lutions
of the great. To exact a regular attendance of
the whole body would have produced confu&s;ion, and
would have impo&s;ed too heavy a burden upon them. To
&s;ummon only a few by writ, tho' it was practi&s;ed and
had a good effect, &s;erved not entirely the King's purpo&s;e;
becau&s;e the&s;e members had no farther authority than
attended their per&s;onal character, and were eclip&s;ed by
the appearance of the more powerful nobility. He there|fore
di&s;pen&s;ed with the attendance of mo&s;t of the le&s;&s;er
barons in parliament; and in return for this indul|gence,
(for &s;uch it was then e&s;teemed) required them
to choo&s;e in each county a certain number of their
own body, who&s;e charges they bore, and who, hav|ing
gained the confidence, carried with them, of
cour&s;e, the authority of the whole order. This ex|pedient
had been practi&s;ed at different times, in the
<PB N="280" REF="305">
reign of Henry III.<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Rot. Clau&s;. 38 Hen. III. m. 7. and 12 d: As al&s;o Rot. Clau&s;. 42 Hen. III. m. I. d. Pryrne's pref. to Cotton's Abridgement.</NOTE> and regularly, during that of the
pre&s;ent King. The numbers &s;ent up by each county
varied at the will of the prince<NOTE N="j" PLACE="foot">Brady's an&s;wer to Petyt, from the records, p. 151.</NOTE>: They took their &s;eat
among the other peers; becau&s;e by their tenure they be|longed
to that order<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Brady's Treati&s;e of Boroughs, App. N&deg;. 13.</NOTE>: The introducing them into that
hou&s;e &s;carce appeared to be an innovation: And though
it was ea&s;ily in the King's power, by varying their num|ber,
to command the re&s;olutions of the whole parliament,
this circum&s;tance was little attended to, in an age, when
force was more prevalent than laws, and when a re&s;olu|tion,
tho' taken by the majority of a legal a&s;&s;embly,
could not be executed, if it oppo&s;ed the will of the more
powerful minority.</P>
<P>BUT there were other important con&s;equences, which
followed the diminution and di$u&s;e of the antient feudal
militia. The King's expences, in levying and maintain|inga
military force for every enterprize, were encrea&s;ed
beyond what his narrow revenues were able to bear: As
the &s;cutages of his military tenants, which were accepted
in lieu of their per&s;onal &s;ervice, had fallen to nothing;
there were no means of &s;upply but from voluntary aids
granted him by the parliament and church: Or from the
talliages which he might levy upon the towns and inha|bitants
in royal deme&s;ne. In the former year, Edward
had been obliged to exact no le&s;s than the &s;ixth of all
moveables from the laity, and the half of all eccle&s;ia&s;tical
benefices<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Brady of boroughs, p. 31. from the records. Heming. vol. i. p. 52. M. We&s;t. p. 422. Ryley, p. 462.</NOTE> for his expedition into Poictou, and the &s;up|pre&s;&s;ion
of the Wel&s;h: And this di&s;tre&s;sful &s;ituation,
which was likely often to return upon him and his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors,
<PB N="281" REF="306">
made him think of a new device, and &s;ummon
up the repre&s;entatives of all the boroughs to parliament.
This period, which is the twenty third of his reign, &s;eems
to be the real and true epoch of the hou&s;e of commons;
and the fir&s;t faint dawnings of popular government in
England. For the repre&s;entatives of the counties were
only deputies from the &s;maller barons and le&s;&s;er nobility:
And the former precedent of repre&s;entatives from the
boroughs, who were &s;ummoned by the earl of Leice&s;ter,
was regarded as the act of a violent usurpation, had been
di&s;continued in all the &s;ub&s;equent parliaments, and if
that mea&s;ure had not become nece&s;&s;ary on other accounts,
this example was more likely to bla&s;t than give credit to it.</P>
<P>DURING the cour&s;e of two centuries, the kings of Eng|land,
in imitation of other European princes, had em|braced
the &s;alutary policy of encouraging and protecting
the lower and more indu&s;trious orders of the &s;tate; whom
they found well di&s;po&s;ed to obey the laws and civil ma|gi&s;trate,
and who&s;e ingenuity and labour furni&s;hed com|modities,
requi&s;ite for the ornament of peace and &s;upport
of war. Tho' the inhabitants of the country were &s;till
left at the di&s;po&s;al of their imperious lords; many at|tempts
were made to give more &s;ecurity and liberty to
citizens, and make them enjoy unmole&s;ted the fruits of
their indu&s;try. Boroughs were erected by royal patent
within the deme&s;ne lands: Liberty of trade was confer|red
upon them: The inhabitants were allowed to farm
at a fixed rent their own tolls and cu&s;toms<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Madox, Firma Burgi, p. 21.</NOTE>: They were
permitted to elect their own magi&s;trates: Ju&s;tice was
di&s;tributed to them by the&s;e magi&s;trates, without obliging
them to attend the &s;heriff or county courts: And &s;ome
&s;hadow of independence was gradually acquired to the
<PB N="282" REF="307">
people, by means or the&s;e equitable privileges<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Brady of boroughs, App. N$. 1, 2, 3.</NOTE>. The
King, however, retained &s;till the power of levying tal|liages
or taxes upon them at plea&s;ure<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">The King had not only the power of tailiating the inhabitants with|in his own deme&s;nes, but that of granting to particular barons the power of ta$liating the inhabitants within theirs. See Brady's an&s;wer to Petyt, p. 118. Madox's Hi&s;t. of the exchequer, p. 518.</NOTE>; and tho' their
poverty and the cu&s;toms of the age made the&s;e de|mands
neither frequent nor exorbitant, &s;uch unlimited
authority in the &s;overeign was a &s;en&s;ible check upon
commerce, and was utterly incompatible with all the
principles of a free government. But when the multi|plied
nece&s;&s;ities of the crown produced a greater demand
for &s;upply, the King, who&s;e prerogative entitled him to
exact it, found, that he had not power &s;ufficient to en|force
his edicts, and that it was requi&s;ite, before he im|po&s;ed
taxes, to &s;mooth the way for his demand, and to
obtain the previous con&s;ent of the boroughs, by &s;ollici|tation,
remon&s;trances, and authority. The inconve|nience
of tran&s;acting this bu&s;ine&s;s with every particular
borough was &s;oon felt; and Edward became &s;en&s;ible, that
the mo&s;t expeditious way of obtaining &s;upply, was to a&s;|&s;emble
together the deputies of all the boroughs, to lay
before them the nece&s;&s;ities of the &s;tate, to di&s;cu&s;s the
matter in their pre&s;ence, and to require their con&s;ent to
the demands of their &s;overeign. For this rea&s;on, he i&s;&s;ued
writs to the &s;heriffs, enjoining them to &s;end to parliament,
along with two knights of the &s;hire, two deputies from
each borough within their county<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Writs were i&s;&s;ued to about 120 cities and boroughs.</NOTE>, and the&s;e provided
with &s;ufficient powers from their community, to con&s;ent,

of them. <HI>As it is a mo&s;t equitable rule,</HI> &s;ays he, in his

often u&s;ed the freedom of omitting particular boroughs
in his returns; and as he received the thanks of the
people for this indulgence, he gave no offence to the
court, who levied, without di&s;tinction, the tax agreed
to by the majority of deputies<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Brady of boroughs, p. 52, from the records. There is even an in|&s;tance in the reign of Edward III, when the King named all the depu|ties.

It was not till the reign of Richard II. that the &s;heriffs were deprived of the power of omitting boroughs at plea|&s;ure. See Stat. at large, 5th Rich. II. cap. 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE union, however, of the repre&s;entatives from all
the boroughs gave gradually more weight to the whole
order; and it became cu&s;tomary for them, in return for
the &s;upplies, which they granted, to prefer petitions to
the crown for the redre&s;s of any particular grievances, of
which they found rea&s;on to complain. The more the
King's demands multiplied, the fa&s;ter the&s;e petitions en|crea&s;ed
both in number and authority; and the prince
found it difficult to refu&s;e men, who&s;e grants had &s;up|ported
his throne, and to who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance he might &s;o
&s;oon be again obliged to have recour&s;e. The commons
however were &s;till much below the rank of legi&s;lators<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">In the reign of Henry IV. the King told the commons, that they were only petitioners, that is, they had not any proper legi&s;lative autho|rity.

Their petitions, tho' they received a verbal a&s;&s;ent from
the throne, were only the rudiments of laws: The judges
were afterwards entru&s;ted with the power of putting
them into form: And the King, by adding to them the
&s;anction of his authority, and that &s;ometimes without
the a&s;&s;ent of the nobles, be&s;towed validity upon them.
The age did not refine &s;o much as to perceive the danger
of the&s;e irregularities. No man was di&s;plea&s;ed, that the
&s;overeign, at the de&s;ire of any cla&s;s of men, &s;hould i&s;&s;ue
an order, which only concerned that cla&s;s; and his pre|dece&s;&s;ors
were &s;o near po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the whole legi&s;lative
power, that he gave no di&s;gu&s;t by a&s;&s;uming it in this
&s;eemingly inoffen&s;ive manner. But time and farther expe|rience
gradually opened mens eyes and corrected &s;uch
abu&s;es. It was found, that no laws could be fixed for
one order of men without affecting the whole; and that
the force and efficacy of laws depended entirely on the
terms employed in wording them. The hou&s;e of peers,
therefore, the mo&s;t powerful order of the &s;tate, rea&s;on|ably
expected, that their a&s;&s;ent &s;hould be expre&s;sly granted
to all public ordinances<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">In the&s;e in&s;tances found in Cotton's abridgment, where the King ap|pears to an&s;wer of him&s;elf the petitions of the commons, he probably exerted no more than that power, which was long inherent in the crown, of regulating le&s;&s;er matters by his edicts or proclamations. But no durable or general &s;tatute &s;eems ever to have been made by the King from the petition of the commons alone, without the a&s;&s;ent of the peers.</NOTE>: And in the reign of Henry V.
the commons required that no laws &s;hould be framed
merely upon their petitions, unle&s;s the &s;tatutes were
worded by them&s;elves, and had pa&s;&s;ed their hou&s;e in the
form of a bill<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Brady's an&s;wer to Petyt, p. 85, from the records.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT as the &s;ame cau&s;es, which produced a partition of
property, continued &s;till to operate; the number of
knights and le&s;&s;er barons, or what the Engli&s;h call the
<PB N="286" REF="311">
gentry, perpetually encrea&s;ed, and &s;unk into a rank &s;till
more interior to the great nobility. The equality of te|nure
was lo&s;t in the great inferiority of power and pro|perty;
and the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives from the coun|ties
was gradually &s;eparated from that of the peers, and
formed a di&s;tinct order in the &s;tate<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Cotton's abridgement, p. 13.</NOTE>. The growth of com|merce,
meanwhile, augmented the private wealth and
con&s;ideration of the burge&s;&s;es; the frequent demands of the
crown encrea&s;ed their public importance; and as they
re&s;embled the knights of &s;hires in one material circum|&s;tance,
that of repre&s;enting particular bodies of men;
it no longer appeared un&s;uitable to unite them together
in the &s;ame hou&s;e, and to confound their rights and pri|vileges<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">It was very agreeable to the maxims of all the feudal governments, that every order of the &s;tate &s;hould give their con&s;ent to the acts which more immediately concerned them; and as the notion of a political &s;y&s;|tem was not then &s;o well under&s;tood, the other orders of the &s;tate were often not con&s;ulted on the&s;e occa&s;ions. In this reign, even the mer|chants, tho' no public body, granted the King impo&s;itions on merchan|dize, becau&s;e the fir&s;t payments came out of their pockets. They did the &s;ame in the reign of Edward III. but the commons had then ob&s;erved that the people paid the&s;e duties, tho' the merchants advanced them; and they therefore remon&s;trated again&s;t this practice. Cotton's abridg. p. 39. The taxes impo&s;ed by the knights on the counties were always lighter than tho&s;e which the burge&s;&s;es laid on the boroughs, a pre&s;ump|tion, that in voting the&s;e taxes the knights and burge&s;&s;es did not form the &s;ame hou&s;e. See chancellor We&s;t's enquiry into the manner of creating peers, p. 8. But there are &s;o many proofs, that the&s;e two orders of repre&s;entatives were long &s;eparate, that it is needle&s;s to in&s;i&s;t on them. Mr. Carte, who had carefully con&s;ulted the rolls of parlia|ment, affirms, that they never appear to have been united till the 16th of Edward III. See Hi&s;t. vol. ii. p. 451. But 'tis certain that this union was not even then final: In 1372, the burge&s;&s;es acted by them&s;elves, and voted a tax after the knights were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. See Tyrrel, Hi&s;t. vol. iii. p. 734, from Rot. Clau&s;. 46 Edw. III. n. 9. In 1376, they were the knights alone, who pa&s;&s;ed a vote for the removal of Alice Pierce from the King's per&s;on, if we may credit Wal&s;ingham, p. 189. There is an in&s;tance of a like kind in the reign of Richard II. Cotton, p. 193. The different taxes voted by the&s;e two branches of the lower hou&s;e, kept them naturally &s;eparate: But as their petitions had mo&s;tly the &s;ame ob|ject, viz. the redre&s;s of grievances, and the &s;upport of law and ju&s;tice both again&s;t the crown and the barons, this cau&s;e as naturally united them, and was the rea&s;on why they at la&s;t joined in one hou&s;e for the di&s;patch of bu&s;ine&s;s. The barons had few petitions: Their privileges were of more antient date: Grievances &s;eldom affected them: They were them|&s;elves the chief oppre&s;&s;ors. In 1333, the knights by them|&s;elves concurred with the bi&s;hops and barons in advi&s;ing the King to &s;tay his journey into Ireland. Here was a petition which regarded a matter of &s;tate, and was &s;uppo&s;ed to be above the capacity of the burge&s;&s;es. The knights, therefore, acted a part in this petition. See Cotton, abridg. p. 13. Chief baron Gilbert think, that the rea&s;on why taxes began al|ways with the commons or burge&s;&s;es was, that they were limited by the in&s;tructions of their boroughs. See Hi&s;t. of the Exchequer, p. 37.</NOTE>.
Thus the third e&s;tate, that of the commons,
<PB N="287" REF="312">
reached at la&s;t its pre&s;ent form; and as the country gen|tlemen
made thenceforwards no &s;cruple of appearing as
deputies of the boroughs, the di&s;tinction between the
members was entirely lo&s;t, and the lower hou&s;e acquired
thence a great acce&s;&s;ion of weight and importance in the
kingdom. Still, however, the office of this e&s;tate was
very different from that which it has &s;ince exerci&s;ed with
&s;o much advantage to the public. In&s;tead of checking
and controuling the authority of the King, they were
naturally induced to adhere to him, as the great fountain
of law and ju&s;tice, and to &s;upport him again&s;t the exor|bitant
power of the ari&s;tocracy, which was at once the
&s;ource of oppre&s;&s;ion to them&s;elves, and di&s;turbed him in
the execution of the laws. The King, in his turn,
gave countenance to an order of men, &s;o u&s;eful and &s;o
little dangerous: The peers al&s;o were obliged to pay
them &s;ome con&s;ideration: And by this means, the third
e&s;tate, formerly &s;o abject in England, as well as in all
other European nations, ro&s;e by flow degrees to their
pre&s;ent importance; and in their progre&s;s made arts and

commerce, the nece&s;&s;ary attendants of liberty and equa|lity,
flouri&s;h in the kingdom<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">The chief argument from antient authority, for the opinion that the repre&s;entatives of boroughs preceded the forty-ninth of Henry III. is the famous petition of the borough of St. Albans, fir&s;t taken notice of by Selden, and then by Petyt, Brady, Tyrrel, and others. In this petition, pre&s;ented to the parliament in the reign of Edward II. the town of St. Albans a&s;&s;erts, that tho' they held <HI>in capite</HI> of the crown, and owed only, for all other &s;ervices, their attendance in parliament, yet the &s;heriff had omitted them in his writs; whereas both in the reign of the King's father, and all his predece&s;&s;ors, they had always &s;ent members. Now, &s;ay the defenders of this opinion, if the commencement of the hou&s;e of commons was in Henry III's reign, this expre&s;&s;ion could not have been u&s;ed. Bat Madox, in his Hi&s;tory of the Exche|quer, p. 522, 523, 524, has endeavoured to de&s;troy the authority of this petition for the purpo&s;e alleged. He a&s;&s;erts, fir&s;t, that there was no &s;uch tenure in England as that of holding by attendance in parlia|ment, in&s;tead of all other &s;ervice. Secondly, That the borough of St. Albans never held of the crown at all, but was always deme&s;ne land of the abbot. It is no wonder, therefore, that a petition which advances two fal&s;hoods, &s;hould contain one hi&s;torical mi&s;take, which indeed amounts only to an inaccurate expre&s;&s;ion. Accordingly St. Albans con|tinued &s;till to belong to the abbot. It never held of the crown, till af|ter the di&s;&s;olution of the mona&s;teries. But the a&s;&s;urance of the&s;e peti|tioners is remarkable. They wanted to &s;hake off the authority of their abbot, and to hold of the King; but were unwilling to pay any &s;ervices even to the crown: Upon which they framed this petition, which latter writers have made the foundation of &s;o many inferences and conclu&s;ions. From the tenor of the petition it appears, that there was a clo&s;e connection between holding of the crown, and being repre&s;ented in parliament: The latter had &s;carce ever place without the former: Yet we learn from Tyrrel's Append. vol. iv. that there were &s;ome in&s;tan|ces to the contrary. It is not improbable, that Edward followed the roll of the earl of Mountfort, who had &s;ummoned, without di&s;tinction, all the con&s;iderable boroughs of the kingdom; among whom there might be &s;ome few who did not hold of the crown. Edward al&s;o found it nece&s;&s;ary to impo&s;e taxes on all the boroughs of the kingdom without di&s;tinction. This was a good expedient for augmenting his re|venue.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHAT &s;ufficiently proves, that the commencement of
<PB N="289" REF="314">
the hou&s;e of burge&s;&s;es, who are the true commons, was
not an affair of chance, but aro&s;e from the nece&s;&s;ities of
the pre&s;ent &s;ituation, is, that Edward, at the very &s;ame
time &s;ummoned deputies from the inferior clergy, the
fir&s;t that ever met in England<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Archbp. Wake's State of the Church of England, p. 235. Brady of boroughs, p. 34. Gilbert's Hi&s;t. of the Exch. p. 46.</NOTE>, and he required them
to impo&s;e taxes on their con&s;tituents for the public &s;ervice.
Formerly the eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices bore no part of the
burthens of the &s;tate: The Pope had indeed of late often
levied impo&s;itions upon them: He had &s;ometimes granted
this power to the &s;overeign<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ann. Waverl. p. 227, 228. T. Wykes, p. 99, 120.</NOTE>: Edward him&s;elf had in the
former year exacted by menaces and violence, a very
grievous tax of half the revenues of the clergy: But as
this precedent was dangerous, and could not ea&s;ily be
repeated in a government, which required the con&s;ent
of the &s;ubject to any extraordinary re&s;olution; Edward
found it more prudent to a&s;&s;emble a lower hou&s;e of con|vocation,
to lay before them his nece&s;&s;ities, and to a&s;k
&s;ome &s;upply. But on this occa&s;ion he met with difficul|ties.
Whether that the clergy thought them&s;elves the
mo&s;t independant body of men in the kingdom, or were
di&s;gu&s;ted by the former exorbitant impo&s;itions, they ab|&s;olutely
refu&s;ed their a&s;&s;ent to the King's demand of a
fifth of their moveables; and it was not till a &s;econd
meeting, that on their per&s;i&s;ting in this refu&s;al, he was
willing to accept of a tenth. The barons and knights
granted him, without he&s;itation, an eleventh; the bur|ge&s;&s;es,
a &s;eventh. But the clergy &s;till &s;crupled to meet
on the King's writ; le&s;t by &s;uch obedience they &s;hould
&s;eem to acknowledge the authority of the temporal
power: And this compromi&s;e was at la&s;t fallen upon,
that the King &s;hould i&s;&s;ue his writ to the archbi&s;hop;

why the eccle&s;ia&s;tics met in two hou&s;es of convocation,
under their &s;everal archbi&s;hops, and formed not one e&s;tate,
like tho&s;e in other countries of Europe, as was at fir&s;t

merited; employed the &s;upplies, granted him by his peo|ple,

northern neighbour. When in this &s;ituation, he received
intelligence of the treaty &s;ecretly concluded between
John and Philip; and tho' unea&s;y at this concurrence of
a French and Scots war, he re&s;olved not to encourage
his enemies by a pu&s;illanimous behaviour, or by yielding
to their united efforts. He &s;ummoned John to perform
the duty of a va&s;&s;al, and to &s;end him a &s;upply of forces
again&s;t an inva&s;ion from France, with which he was
then threatened: He next required, that the fortre&s;&s;es of
Berwic, Jedborough, and Roxborough, &s;hould be put
into his hands as a &s;ecurity during the war<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 692. Wal&s;ing. p. 64. Heming. vol. i. p. 84. Trivet, p. 286.</NOTE>: He cited

And when none of the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ive demands were

forces, 30,000 foot, and 4000 hor&s;e, to cha&s;ti&s;e his rebel|lious
va&s;&s;al. The Scotti&s;h nation, who had little reli|lious
on the vigour and &s;pirit of their prince, a&s;&s;igned
him a council of twelve noblemen, in who&s;e hands the
<PB N="291" REF="316">
&s;overeignty was really lodged<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 75.</NOTE>, and who put the country
in the be&s;t po&s;ture, of which the pre&s;ent di&s;tractions
would admit. A great army, compo&s;ed of 40,000 infan|try,
tho' &s;upported only by 500 cavalry, advanced to the
frontiers; and after a fruitle&s;s attempt upon Carli&s;le,
marched ea&s;twards to defend tho&s;e provinces, which Ed|ward
was preparing to attack. But &s;ome of the mo&s;t
con&s;iderable of the Scotti&s;h nobles, Robert Bruce, the
father and &s;on, the earls of March and Angus, progno&s;|ticating
the ruin of their country, from the concurrence
of inte&s;tine divi&s;ions and a foreign inva&s;ion, endeavoured
here to ingratiate them&s;elves with Edward, by an early
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and the King, encouraged by this favour|able
incident, led his army, into the enemies' country,
and cro&s;&s;ed the Tweed without oppo&s;ition at Cold&s;tream.<NOTE PLACE="marg">28th March</NOTE>
He then received a me&s;&s;age from John, by which that
prince, having now procured, for him&s;elf and his nation,
Pope Cele&s;tine's di&s;pen&s;ation from former oaths, renoun|ced

&s;et Edward at defiance<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 607. Wal&s;ing. p. 66. Heming. Vol. i. p. 92.</NOTE>. This bravade was but ill &s;up|ported
by the military operations of the Scots. Berwic
was already taken by a&s;&s;ault; Sir William Douglas, the

He attacked them with great vigour; and as undi&s;|ciplined

amounted to 20,000 men: The ca&s;tle of Dunbar, with

after the battle, had brought up the main body of the

again obliged to &s;wear fealty to Edward. After a feeble
re&s;i&s;tance, the ca&s;tles of Edinburgh and Stirling opened

to their own princes, and aver&s;e to the re&s;traint
of laws, endeavoured to prevent the deva&s;tation of their
country, by giving him early proofs of obedience: And
Edward, having brought the whole kingdom to a &s;eem|ing
&s;tate of tranquillity, returned to the &s;outh with his
army. There was a &s;tone, to which the popular &s;uper|&s;tition
of the Scots paid the highe&s;t veneration: All their
Kings were &s;eated on it when they received the rite of
inauguration: An antient tradition a&s;&s;ured them, that
wherever this &s;tone was placed, their nation &s;hould al|ways
govern: And it was carefully pre&s;erved at Scone,
as the true palladium of their monarchy, and their ulti|mate
re&s;ource amid&s;t all their misfortunes. Edward got
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it; and carried it with him to England<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing. p. 68. Trivet, p. 299.</NOTE>.
He gave orders to de&s;troy all the records, and all tho&s;e
monuments of antiquity, which might pre&s;erve the me|mory
of the independance of the kingdom, and refute
the Engli&s;h claims of &s;uperiority. The Scots pretend,
that he al&s;o de&s;troyed all the annals pre&s;erved in their
convents: But it is not probable, that a nation, &s;o rude
and unpoli&s;hed, would be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any hi&s;tory, which
de&s;erves much to be regreted. The great &s;eal of Baliol
was broke; and that prince him&s;elf was carried a pri&s;on|er
to London, and committed to cu&s;tody in the Tower.
Two years afterwards he was re&s;tored to his liberty, and
&s;ubmitted to a voluntary bahi&s;hment in France, where,
without making any farther attempts for the recovery of
his royalty, he died in a private &s;tation. Earl Warrenne
was left governor of Scotland<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 726. Trivet, p, 295.</NOTE>: Engli&s;hmen were en|tru&s;ted

him&s;elf that he had attained the end of all his wi&s;hes,
and that the long train of fraud and violence which he
had practi&s;ed again&s;t Scotland, had terminated in the
final reduction of that kingdom, returned with his victo|rious
army into England.</P>
<P>AN attempt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with France.</NOTE> which he made about the &s;ame time, for
the recovery of Guienne, was not equally &s;ucce&s;sful.
He &s;ent thither an army of 7000 men, under the com|mand
of his brother the earl of Lanca&s;ter; and that prince
gained at fir&s;t &s;ome advantages over the French at Bour|deaux:
But he was &s;oon after &s;eized with a di&s;temper,
of which he died at Bayonne. The command devolved
on the earl of Lincoln, who was not able to perform any
thing con&s;iderable during the re&s;t of the campaign<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 72, 73, 74.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT the active and ambitious &s;pirit of Edward, while
his conque&s;ts brought &s;uch con&s;iderable acce&s;&s;ions to the
Engli&s;h monarchy, could never be &s;atisfied, &s;o long as
Guienne, the antient patrimony of his family, was wre&s;t|ed
from him by the di&s;hone&s;t artifices of the French mo|narch.
Finding, that the di&s;tance of that province ren|dered
all his efforts again&s;t it feeble and uncertain, he
propo&s;ed to attack France in a quarter where &s;he appear|ed
more vulnerable; and with this view, he married his
daughter Elizabeth to John earl of Holland, and at
the &s;ame time contracted an alliance with Guy earl
of Flanders, &s;tipulated to pay him the &s;um of 75,000l.
and projected an inva&s;ion with their united forces upon
Philip, their common enemy<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 761. Wal&s;ing. p. 68.</NOTE>. He hoped, that, when
he him&s;elf, at the head of the Engli&s;h, Flemi&s;h, and
Dutch armies, re-inforced by his German allies, to whom
he had promi&s;ed or remitted very con&s;iderable &s;ums,
&s;hould enter the frontiers of France, and threaten the
capital it&s;elf with imminent danger, Philip would at la&s;t
<PB N="295" REF="320">
be obliged to relinqui&s;h his acqui&s;itions, and purcha&s;e
peace by the re&s;titution of Guienne. But in order to &s;et
this great machine in movement, con&s;iderable &s;upplies
were requi&s;ite from the parliament; and Edward, with|out
much difficulty, obtained from the barons and
knights a new grant of a twelfth of all their moveables,
and from the boroughs, that of an eighth. The great
and almo&s;t unlimited power of the King over the latter,
enabled him to throw the heavie&s;t part of the burthen on
them; and the prejudices, which he &s;eems always to
have entertained again&s;t the church, on account of their
former zeal for the Mountfort faction, made him re&s;olve
to load them with &s;till more con&s;iderable impo&s;itions,
and he required of them a fifth of their moveables. But
he here met with an oppo&s;ition, which for &s;ome time di&s;|concerted
all his mea&s;ures, and engaged him in enter|prizes,
which were &s;omewhat dangerous to <HI>him,</HI> and
would have proved ruinous to any of his predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>BONIFACE VIII.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;&s;entions with the clergy.</NOTE> who had &s;ucceeded Cele&s;tine in the
papal throne, was a man of the mo&s;t lofty and enterpriz|ing
&s;pirit; and tho' he wanted that au&s;terity of manners,
which commonly accompanies ambition in men of his
order, he was determined to carry the authority of the
tiara, and his dominion over the temporal power, to as
great a height as it had ever attained in any former pe|riod.
Sen&s;ible that his immediate predece&s;&s;ors, by oppre&s;|&s;ing
the church in every province of Chri&s;tendom, had
extremely alienated the affections of the clergy, and had
afforded the civil magi&s;trate a pretence for laying like
impo&s;itions on eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues, he attempted to
re&s;ume the former &s;tation of the &s;overeign pontiff, and
to e&s;tabli&s;h him&s;elf as the common protector of the &s;pi|ritual
order again&s;t all invaders. For this purpo&s;e, he
i&s;&s;ued very early in his pontificate a general bull, prohi|biting
all princes to levy without his con&s;ent any taxes
<PB N="296" REF="321">
from the clergy, and all clergymen to &s;ubmit to &s;uch im|po&s;itions;
and threatening both of them with the penal|ties
of excommunication in ca&s;e of di&s;obedience<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 706. Heming. vol. i. p. 104.</NOTE>. This
important edict is &s;aid to have been procured by the &s;oli|citation
of Robert de Winchel&s;ey, archbi&s;hop of Can|terbury,
who intended to employ it as a rampart again&s;t
the violent extortions which the church had felt from
Edward, and the &s;till greater, which that prince's multi|plied
nece&s;&s;ities gave them rea&s;on to apprehend. When
a demand, therefore, was made on the clergy of a fifth of
their moveables, a tax which was probably much more
grievous than a fifth of their revenue, as their lands were
mo&s;tly &s;tocked with their cattle, and cultivated by their
villains; the clergy took &s;helter under the bull of Pope
Boniface, and pleaded con&s;cience in refu&s;ing compli|ance<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 107. Trivet, p. 296. Chron. Dun&s;t. vol. ii. p. 652.</NOTE>.
The King came not immediately to extremities
on this repul&s;e; but after locking up all their granaries
and barns, and prohibiting all rent to be paid them, he
appointed a new &s;ynod, to confer upon his demand. The
primate, not di&s;mayed by the&s;e proofs of Edward's re&s;o|lution,
here plainly told him, that the clergy owed obe|dience
to two &s;overeigns, their &s;piritual and their tempo|ral;
but their duty bound them to a much &s;tricter at|tachment
to the former than to the latter: They could
not comply with his commands (for &s;uch, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure,
the reque&s;ts of the crown were then deemed) in
contradiction to the expre&s;s prohibition of the &s;overeign
pontiff<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Heming, vol. i. p. 107.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE clergy had &s;een from many proofs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1297.</NOTE> that Edward
paid very little regard to tho&s;e numerous privileges, on
which they &s;et &s;o high a value. He had formerly &s;eized,
in an arbitrary manner, all the money and plate lodged
<PB N="297" REF="322">
in the churches and convents, and had applied them to
the public &s;ervice<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;in. p. 65. Heming. vol. i. p. 51.</NOTE>; and they could not but expect
more violent treatment on this &s;harp refu&s;al, grounded
on &s;uch dangerous principles. In&s;tead of applying to
the Pope for a relaxation of his bull, he re&s;olved imme|diately
to employ the power in his hands; and he told
the eccle&s;ia&s;tics, that, &s;ince they refu&s;ed to &s;upport the
civil government, they were unworthy to receive any
benefit from it; and he would accordingly put them out
of the protection of the laws. This vigorous mea&s;ure
was immediately carried into execution<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;in. p. 69. Heming. vol. i. p. 107.</NOTE>. Orders were
i&s;&s;ued to the judges to receive no cau&s;e brought before,
them by the clergy; to hear and decide all cau&s;es in
which they were defendants: To do every man ju&s;tice
again&s;t them; to do them ju&s;tice again&s;t no body<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">M. We&s;t. p. 429.</NOTE>.
The eccle&s;ia&s;tics immediately found them&s;elves in the
mo&s;t mi&s;erable &s;ituation imaginable. They could not
remain in their own hou&s;es or convents for want of &s;ub|&s;i&s;tance:
If they went abroad, in que&s;t of maintenance,
they were di&s;mouhted from, their hor&s;es, robbed of their
cloaths, abu&s;ed by every ruffian, and no redre&s;s could be
obtained by them for the mo&s;t violent injury. The pri|mate
him&s;elf was attacked on the high way, was &s;tripped
of all his equipage and furniture, and was at la&s;t reduced
to board him&s;elf with a &s;ingle &s;ervant in the hou&s;e of a
country clergyman<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 109.</NOTE>. The King, mean while, remained
an indifferent &s;pectator of all the&s;e violences; and with|out
employing his officers in committing any immediate
injury on the prie&s;ts, which might have appeared invidi|ous
and oppre&s;&s;ive, he took ample vengeance on them
for their ob&s;tiriate refu&s;al of his demands. Tho' the

<P>THESE acts of violence and of arbitrary power, not|with&s;tanding

it was not long, before &s;ome of the great nobility, jea|lous
of their own privileges, as well as of national liber|ty,
gave countenance and authority to the&s;e complaints.
Edward a&s;&s;embled an army on the &s;ea-coa&s;t, which he
<PB N="300" REF="325">
propo&s;ed to &s;end over into Ga&s;cony, while he him&s;elf
&s;hould in per&s;on make an impre&s;&s;ion on the &s;ide of Flan|ders,
and he intended to put the&s;e forces under the com|mand
of Humphrey Bohun, earl of Hereford, the con|&s;table,
and Roger Bigod, earl of Norfolk, the mare&s;chal
of England. But the&s;e two powerful earls refu&s;ed to ex|ecute
his orders, and affirmed, that they were only
obliged by their office to attend his per&s;on in the wars.
A violent altercation en&s;ued; and the King, in the
height of his pa&s;&s;ion, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the con&s;table,
exclaimed, <HI>Sir earl, by God, you &s;hall either go or hang.
By God, Sir King,</HI> replied Hereford, <HI>I will neither go nor
hang</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 112.</NOTE>. And he immediately departed, with the mare|&s;chal,

<P>UPON this oppo&s;ition, the King laid a&s;ide the project
of an expedition again&s;t Guienne; and a&s;&s;embled the
army, which he propo&s;ed to tran&s;port into Flanders.
But the two earls, irritated in the conte&s;t and elated by
impunity, pretending that none of their ance&s;tors had
ever &s;erved in that country, refu&s;ed to perform the duty
of their office in mu&s;tering the army<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 783. Wal&s;in. p. 70.</NOTE>. The King, now

Geoffrey de Geyneville, to act in that emergence, as
con&s;table and mare&s;chal<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">M. We&s;t. p. 430.</NOTE>. He endeavoured to reconcile

made him, in conjunction with Reginald de
Grey, tutor to the prince, whom he propo&s;ed to appoint
guardian of the kingdom during his ab&s;ence; and he
even a&s;&s;embled a great number of the nobility in We&s;t|min&s;ter-hall,
to whom he deigned to make an apology
<PB N="301" REF="326">
for his pa&s;t conduct. He pleaded the urgent nece&s;&s;ities
of the crown; his extreme want of money; his engage|ment
from honour as well as intere&s;t to &s;upport his allies
abroad: And he promi&s;ed, if ever he returned in &s;afety,
to redre&s;s all their grievances, to re&s;tore the execution of
the laws, and to make all his &s;ubjects compen&s;ation for
the lo&s;&s;es, which they had &s;u&s;tained. Meanwhile, he
begged them to &s;u&s;pend their animo&s;ities; to judge of
him by his future behaviour, of which, he hoped, he
would be more ma&s;ter; to remain faithful to his govern|ment,

<P>THERE were certainly, from the concurrence of di&s;|contents
among the great, and the grievances of the peo|ple,
materials &s;ufficient in any other period to have kin|dled
a civil war in England: But the vigour and abilities
of Edward kept every one in awe; and his dexterity in
&s;topping on the brink of danger, and retracting the mea|&s;ures,
to which he was pu&s;hed by his violent temper and
arbitrary principles, &s;aved the nation from &s;o great a ca|lamity.
The two great earls dared not to break but into
open violence; and they proceeded no farther than fram|ing
a remon&s;trance, which was delivered to the King at
Winchel&s;ea, when he was ready to embark for Flanders.
They there complained of the violations of the great
charter and that of fore&s;ts; the violent &s;eizure of corn,
leather, cattle, and above all, of wool, a commodity,
which they affirmed to be equal in value to half the lands
of the kingdom; the arbitrary impo&s;ition of forty &s;hil|lings
a &s;ack on the &s;mall quantity of wool allowed to be
exported by the merchants; and they claimed an im|mediate
redre&s;s of all the&s;e grievances<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing. p. 71. Heming vol. i. p. 115. Trivet, p. 302.</NOTE>. The King told
them, that the greate&s;t part of his council were now ab|&s;ent,
<PB N="302" REF="327">
and without their advice he could not deliberate on
mea&s;ures of &s;o great con&s;equence<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing. p. 72. Homing. vol. i. p. 117. Trivet, p. 304.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT the con&s;table and mare&s;chal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diffen&s;ions with the barons.</NOTE> with the barons of
their party, re&s;olved to take advantage of Edward's ab|&s;ence,
and to obtain an authentic a&s;&s;ent to their de|mands.
When &s;ummoned to attend the parliament at
London, they came with a great body of cavalry and in|fantry;
and before they would enter the city, required
that the gates &s;hould be put into their cu&s;tody<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 138.</NOTE>. The
primate, who &s;ecretly favoured all their preten&s;ions, ad|vi&s;ed
the council to comply; and thus they became ma&s;|ters
both of the young prince and of the re&s;olutions of
parliament. Their demands, however, were very mo|derate;
and &s;uch as &s;ufficiently ju&s;tify the purity of their
intention in all their pa&s;t mea&s;ures: They only required,
that the two charters &s;hould receive a &s;olemn confirma|tion;
that a clau&s;e &s;hould be added to fecure the nation
for ever again&s;t all impo&s;itions and taxes without con&s;ent
of parliament; and that they them&s;elves and their ad|herents,
who had refu&s;ed to attend the King into Flan|ders,
&s;hould be pardoned for this offence, and &s;hould be
again received into favour<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing. p. 73. Heming. vol. i. p. 138, 139, 140, 141. Trivet, p. 308.</NOTE>. The prince of Wales and
his council a&s;&s;ented to the&s;e terms; and the charters
were &s;ent over to the King in Flanders to be there con|firmed
by him. Edward felt the utmo&s;t reluctance to
this mea&s;ure, which, he apprehended, would for the fu|ture
impo&s;e fetters on his conduct, and &s;et limits to his
lawle&s;s authority. On various pretences, he delayed
three days the giving any an&s;wer to the deputies; and
when the pernicious con&s;equences of his refu&s;al were re|pre&s;ented
to him, he was at la&s;t obliged, after many in|ternal
<PB N="303" REF="328">
&s;truggles, to affix his &s;eal to tne charters, as al&s;o
to the clau&s;e that bereaved him of the power, which he
had hitherto a&s;&s;umed, of impo&s;ing arbitrary taxes upon
the people<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing. p. 74. Heming. vol. i. p. 143.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THAT we may fini&s;h at once this intere&s;ting tran&s;ac|tion
concerning the &s;ettlement of the charters, we &s;hall
briefly mention the &s;ub&s;equent events which relate to it.
The con&s;table and mare&s;chal, informed of the King's
compliance, were &s;atisfied; and not only cea&s;ed from dif|turbing
the government, but a&s;&s;i&s;ted the regency with all
their power again&s;t the Scots, who had ri&s;en in arms,
and had thrown off the yoke of the Engli&s;h<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 143.</NOTE>. But being
&s;en&s;ible, that the &s;malle&s;t pretence would &s;uffice to make
Edward retract the&s;e dete&s;ted laws, which, tho' they had
often received the &s;anction both of King and parliament,
and had been acknowledged during three reigns, were
never yet deemed to have &s;ufficient validity; they in&s;i&s;t|ed,
that he &s;hould again confirm them on his return to
England, and &s;hould thereby renounce all plea which he
might derive from his re&s;iding in a foreign country, when
he formerly affixed his &s;eal to them<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 159.</NOTE>. It appeared, that
they judged aright of Edward's character and intentions:
He delayed this confirmation as long as po&s;&s;ible; and
when the fear of wor&s;e con&s;equences obliged him again
to comply, he added expre&s;sly a &s;alvo for his royal dignity
or prerogative, which in effect enervated the force of the
whole charter<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 167, 163.</NOTE>. The two earls and their adherents left
the parliament in di&s;content; and the King was con|&s;trained,
in a future &s;e&s;&s;ion, to grant the people, without
any &s;ubterfuge, a pure and ab&s;olute confirmation of tho&s;e
laws<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 168.</NOTE>, which were &s;o much the object of their pa&s;&s;ionate
affection. Even farther &s;ecurities were then provided for
<PB N="304" REF="329">
the e&s;tabli&s;hment of national privileges. Three knights
were appointed to be cho&s;en in each county, and were
inve&s;ted with the power of puni&s;hing by fines and impri|&s;onment,
every tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion or violation of the char|ters<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Hemingford, vol. i. p. 170.</NOTE>:
A precaution, which, tho' it was &s;oon di&s;u&s;ed, as
encroaching too much on royal prerogative, proves the
attachment, which the Engli&s;h in that age bore to liber|ty,
and their well-founded jealou&s;y of the arbitrary dif|po&s;ition
of Edward.</P>
<P>THE work, however, was not yet entirely fini&s;hed
and compleat. In order to execute the le&s;&s;er charter, it
was requi&s;ite by new perambulations to &s;et bounds to the
royal fore&s;ts, and to di&s;affore&s;t all tho&s;e lands which for|mer
encroachments had comprehended within their li|mits.
Edward di&s;covered the &s;ame reluctance to comply
with this equitable demand; and it was not till after
many delays on his part, and many &s;olicitations and re|que&s;ts,
and even menaces of war and violence<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing, p. 80. We are told by Tyrrel, vol. ii. p. 145. from the Chronicle of St. Albans, that the barons, not contented with the exe|cution of the charter of fore&s;ts, demanded of Edward as high terms as had been impo&s;ed on his father by the earl of Leice&s;ter: But no other hi&s;torian mentions this particular.</NOTE>, on the
part of the barons, that the perambulations were made,
and exact bounderies fixt, by a jury in each county, to
the extent of his fore&s;ts<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 171. M. We&s;t. p. 431, 433.</NOTE>. Had not his ambitious and
active temper rai&s;ed him &s;o many foreign enemies, and
obliged him to have recour&s;e &s;o often to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
his &s;ubjects, it is likely that the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions could never
have been extorted from him.</P>
<P>BUT while the people, after fo many &s;ucce&s;sful &s;trug|gles,
deemed them&s;elves happy in the &s;ecure po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
their privileges; they were &s;urprized in 1305 to find,
that Edward had &s;ecretly applied to Rome, and had pro|cured
<PB N="305" REF="330">
from that mercenary court, an ab&s;olution from all
the oaths and engagements, which he had &s;o often reite|rated
to ob&s;erve both the charters. There are &s;ome hi&s;|torians<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Brady, vol. ii. p. 84. Carte, vol. ii. p. 292.</NOTE>
&s;o credulous as to imagine, that this perilous &s;tep was taken by him for no other purpo&s;e than to ac|quire
the merit of granting a new confirmation of the
charters, as he did &s;oon after; and a confirmation &s;o
much the more unque&s;tionable, that It coulc! never after
be invalidated by his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors from the pretence of any
force or violence which had been impo&s;ed on him. But
be&s;ides, that this might have been done with a much
better grace, if he had never applied for any &s;uch ab&s;o|lution,
the whole tenor of his conduct proves him to be
little &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;uch refinements in patrioti&s;m; and
this very deed itfelf, in which he confirmed anew the
charters, carries on the face of it a very oppo&s;ite pre|&s;umption.
Tho' he ratified the charters in general, he
&s;till laid hold of the papal bull &s;o far as to invalidate the
late perambulations of the fore&s;ts, which had been made
with &s;uch care and attention, and to re&s;erve to him&s;elf
the power, in ca&s;e of favourable incidents, to extend as
much as formerly the&s;e arbitrary juri&s;dictions. If the
power was not in fact made u&s;e of, we can only con|clude,
that the favourable incidents did not occur.</P>
<P>THUS, after the conte&s;ts of near a whole century, and
tho&s;e ever accompanied with violent jealou&s;ies, often
with public convul&s;ions, the great charter was finally
e&s;tabli&s;hed; and the Engli&s;h nation have the honour of
extorting, by their per&s;everance, this conce&s;&s;ion from
the able&s;t, the mo&s;t warlike, and the mo&s;t ambitious of
all their princes<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">It mu&s;t however be remarked, that the King never forgave the chief actors in this tran&s;action, and he found means afterwards to oblige both the con&s;table and mare&s;chal to re&s;ign their offices into his hands.

confirmations of it were at different times required of &s;e|veral
Kings, and granted by them, in full parliament; a
precaution, which, while it di&s;covers &s;ome ignorance of
the true nature of law and government, proves a very
laudable jealou&s;y of national privileges in the people, and
an extreme anxiety, left contrary precedents &s;hould ever
be pleaded as an authority for infringing them. Accord|ingly
we find, that, tho' arbitrary practices often pre|vailed,
and were even able to e&s;tabli&s;h them&s;elves into
&s;ettled cu&s;toms, the validity of the great charter was ne|ver
afterwards formally di&s;puted; and that grant was
&s;till regarded as the ba&s;is of the Engli&s;h government, and
the &s;ure rule by which the authority of every cu&s;tom
was to be tried and canva&s;&s;ed. The juri&s;diction of the
Star-chamber, martial law, impri&s;onment by warrants
from the privy-council, and other practices of a like na|ture,
tho' e&s;tabli&s;hed for &s;everal centuries, were &s;carce
ever allowed by the Engli&s;h to be parts of their con&s;titution:
The affection of the nation for liberty &s;till pre|vailed
over all precedent, and even all political rea&s;on|ing:
The exerci&s;e of the&s;e powers, after being long the
&s;ource of &s;ecret murmurs among the people, was, in
fullne&s;s of time, &s;olemnly aboli&s;hed, as illegal, at lea&s;t
as oppre&s;&s;ive, by the whole legi&s;lative authority.</P>
<P>TO return to the period, from which this account of
the charters has led us: Tho' the King's impatience to
appear at the head of his armies in Flanders made him
overlook all con&s;iderations, either of dome&s;tic di&s;contents
or of commotions among the Scots; he had been &s;o
long retarded by the &s;everal ob&s;tructions thrown in his
way, that he lo&s;t the proper &s;ea&s;on for action, and after
his arrival made no progre&s;s again&s;t the enemy. The
King of France, taking advantage of his ab&s;ence, had
<PB N="307" REF="334">
broke into the Low Countries; had defeated the Flem|ings
in the battle of Furnes; had made him&s;elf ma&s;ter
of Li&s;le, St. Omer, Courtrai, and Ypres; and feemed
in a &s;ituation to take full vengeance on the earl of Flan|ders,
his rebellious va&s;&s;al. But Edward, &s;econded by an
Engli&s;h army of 50,000 men (for this is the number
a&s;&s;igned by hi&s;torians<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Heming, vol. i. p. 146.</NOTE>) was &s;oon able to &s;top the career
of his victories; and Philip, finding all the weak re&s;our|ces
of his kingdom to be already exhau&s;ted, began to
dread a rever&s;e of fortune, and to apprehend an inva&s;ion
on France it&s;elf. The King of England, on the other
hand, di&s;appointed of a&s;&s;i&s;tance from Adolph, King of
the Romans, which he had purcha&s;ed at a very high
price, and finding many urgent calls for his pre&s;ence in
England, was de&s;irous of ending on any honourable
terms a war, which &s;erved only to divert his force from
the execution of more important projects. This di&s;po|&s;ition
of both monarchs &s;oon produced a ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;|tilities
for two years; and engaged them to &s;ubmit their
differences to the arbitration of Pope Boniface.</P>
<P>BONIFACE was the la&s;t of the &s;overeign pontiffs who
exerci&s;ed an authority over the temporal juri&s;diction of
princes;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1298.</NOTE> and the&s;e exorbitant preten&s;ions, which he had
been tempted to a&s;&s;ume from the &s;ucce&s;sful example of
his predece&s;&s;ors, but of which the &s;ea&s;on was now pa&s;t,
involved him in &s;o many calamities, and were attended
with &s;o unfortunate a cata&s;trophe, that they have been,
&s;ecretly abandoned, tho' never openly relinquifhed, by
his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in the apo&s;tolic chair. Edward and Philip,
equally jealous of papal claims, took care to in&s;ert in
their reference, that Boniface was made judge of the dif|ferences
by their con&s;ent, as a private per&s;on, not by
any right of his pontificate; and the Pope, without
<PB N="308" REF="335">
&s;eeming to be offended at this mortifying clau&s;e, proceed|ed
to give a &s;entence between them, in which they both
acquie&s;ced<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 817. Heming. vol. i. p. 149. Trivet, p. 310.</NOTE>. He brought them to agree, that their uni|on
&s;hould be cemented by a double marriage; that of
Edward him&s;elf, who was now a widower, with Marga|ret,
Philip's &s;i&s;ter, and that of the prince of Wales with
I&s;abella, the daughter of that monarch<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 823.</NOTE>. Philip was
likewife willing to re&s;tore Guienne to the Engli&s;h, which
he had indeed no preten&s;ions to detain; but he in&s;i&s;ted,
that the Scots and their King, John Baliol, &s;hould, as
his allies, be al&s;o comprehended in the treaty, and &s;hould
be re&s;tored to their liberty. The difference was, after
&s;everal di&s;putes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace with France.</NOTE> compromi&s;ed by making mutual facri|fices
to each other. Edward agreed to abandon his ally
the earl of Flanders, on condition that Philip &s;hould
treat in like manner his ally the King of Scots. The
pro&s;pect of conquering the&s;e two countries, who&s;e &s;itu|ation
made them &s;o commodious an acqui&s;ition to the
different kingdoms, prevailed over all other con&s;idera|tions;
and tho' they were both finally di&s;appointed in their hopes, their
conduct was very reconcilable to the princi|ples
of an intere&s;ted policy. This was the fir&s;t &s;pecimen
which the Scots had of the French alliance, and which
was exactly conformable to what a &s;maller power mu&s;t
always expect, when it blindly attaches it&s;elf to the will
and fortunes of a greater. That unhappy people, now
engaged in a brave, tho' unequal conte&s;t for their liber|ties,
were totally abandoned by the ally, in whom they
repo&s;ed their final confidences to the will of ah imperious
conqueror.</P>
<P>THO' England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Revolt of Scotland.</NOTE> as well as other European countries,
was, in its antient &s;tate, very ill qualified for making,
and &s;till wor&s;e for maintaining conque&s;ts, Scotland was
<PB N="309" REF="336">
&s;o much inferior in its internal force, and was &s;o ill &s;itu|ated
for receiving foreign &s;uccours, that it is no wonder
an ambitious monarch &s;hould have ca&s;t his eye on &s;o
tempting an acqui&s;ition, which brought both &s;ecurity
and greatne&s;s to his native kingdom. But the in&s;tru|ments
whom Edward employed to maintain his dominion
over the northern kingdom, were not happily cho&s;en;
and acted not with the requi&s;ite prudence and moderation,
in reconciling the Scotti&s;h nation to a yoke, which
they bore with &s;uch extreme reluctance. Warrenne
retiring into England, on account of his bad &s;late of
health, left the admini&s;tration entirely in the hands of
Orme&s;by, who was appointed ju&s;ticiary of Scotland, and
Cre&s;&s;ingham, who bore the office of trea&s;urer; and a
very &s;mall military force remained to &s;ecure the precari|ous
authority of the&s;e mini&s;ters. The latter had no
other object but the ama&s;&s;ing money by rapine and in|ju&s;tice:
The former di&s;tingui&s;hed himself by the rigor
and &s;everity of his temper: And both of them, treating
the Scots as a conquered people, made them &s;en&s;ible,
too early, of the grievous &s;ervitude into which they had
fallen. As Edward required, that all the proprietors of
land &s;hould &s;wear fealty to him; everyone, who re&s;u&s;ed
or delayed the giving this te&s;timony of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, was
outlawed, and confined, and puni&s;hed without mercy;
and the brave&s;t and mo&s;t generous &s;pirits of the nation
were thus exa&s;perated to the highe&s;t degree again&s;t the
Engli&s;h government<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing. p. 70. Heming. vol. 5. p. 118. Trivet, p. 299.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE was one William Wallace, of a &s;mall fortune,
but de&s;cended of an antient family, in the we&s;t of Scot|land,
who&s;e courage prompted him to undertake, and
enabled him finally to execute, the de&s;perate attempt of
delivering his native country from the dominion of fo|reigners.
This man, who&s;e valorous exploits are the
<PB N="310" REF="337">
object of ju&s;t admiration, but have been much exagge|rated
by the traditions of his countrymen, had been pro|voked
by the in&s;olence of an Engli&s;h officer to put him
to death; and finding him&s;elf obnoxious on that account
to the &s;everity of the admini&s;tration, he fled into the
woods, and offered him&s;elf as a leader to all tho&s;e whom
their crimes or bad fortune, or avowed hatred of the
Engli&s;h, had reduced to a like nece&s;&s;ity. He was endow|ed
with a gigantic, force of body, with heroic courage of
mind, with di&s;intere&s;ted magnanimity, with an incredi|ble
patience and ability to bear hunger, fatigue, and all
the &s;everities of the &s;ea&s;ons; and he &s;oon acquired among
tho&s;e de&s;perate fugitives that authority to which his vir|tues
&s;o ju&s;tly intitled him. Beginning with &s;mall at|tempts,
in which he was always &s;ucce&s;sful, he gradually
proceeded to more momentous enterprizes; and he di&s;|covered
equal caution in &s;ecuring his followers, and va|lour
in annoying the enemy. By his knowledge of the
country, he was enabled, when pur&s;ued, to en&s;ure a re|treat
among the mora&s;&s;es or fore&s;ts or mountains; and
again, collecting his di&s;per&s;ed a&s;&s;ociates, he appeared un|expectedly
in another quarter, and &s;urprized and routed
and put to the &s;word the unwary Engli&s;h. Every day
brought accounts of his great actions, which were re|ceived
with no le&s;s favour by his countrymen than terror
by the enemy: All tho&s;e, who thir&s;ted after military
fame, were de&s;irous to partake of his renown: His &s;uc|ce&s;sful
valour &s;eemed to vindicate the nation from the ig|nominy
into which it had fallen, by its tame &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion
to the Engli&s;h: And tho' no nobleman of note ventured
as yet to join his party, he had gained a general confi|dence
and attachment, which birth and fortune are not
alone able to confer.</P>
<P>WALLACE, having by many fortunate enterprizes,
brought the valour of his followers to corre&s;pond to his
<PB N="311" REF="338">
own, re&s;olved to &s;trike a deci&s;ive blow again&s;t the Engli&s;h
government; and he concerted the plan of attacking
Orme&s;by at Scone, and of taking vengeance on him, for
all the violence and tyranny of which he had been guilty.
The ju&s;ticiary, apprized of his intention, fled ha&s;tily into
England: All the other officers of that nation imitated
his example: Their terror added alacrity and courage to
the Scots, who betook them&s;elves to arms in every quar|ter:
Many of the principal barons, and among the re&s;t
&s;ir William Douglas<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;in. p. 70. Heming. vol. i. p. 118.</NOTE>, openly countenanced Wallace's
party: Robert Bruce &s;ecretly favoured and promoted the
&s;ame cau&s;e: And the Scots, &s;haking off their fetters,
prepared them&s;elves to defend, by an united effort, that
liberty which they had to unexpectedly recovered from
the hands of their oppre&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>BUT Warrenne, collecting an army of 40,000 men
in the north of England, prepared to re-e&s;tabli&s;h his au|thority;
and he endeavoured by the celerity of his arma|ment,
and of his march, to compen&s;ate for his pa&s;t neg|ligence,
which had enabled the Scots to &s;hake off the
Engli&s;h government. He &s;uddenly entered Annandale,
and came up with the enemy at Irvine, before their
forces were fully collected, and before they had put
them&s;elves in a proper po&s;ture of defence. Many of the
Scots nobles, alarmed with their dangerous &s;ituation,
here &s;ubmitted to the Engli&s;h, renewed their oaths of
fealty, promi&s;ed to deliver ho&s;tages for their good be|haviour,
and received a pardon for all pa&s;t offences<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 121, 122.</NOTE>.
Others who had not yet declared them&s;elves, &s;uch as the
&s;teward of Scotland and the earl of Lennox, joined, tho'
with reluctance, the Engli&s;h army; and waited a fa|vourable
opportunity of embracing the cau&s;e of their di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed
countrymen. But Wallace, who&s;e authority
<PB N="312" REF="339">
over his retainers was more fully confirmed by the ab|&s;ence
of the great nobles, per&s;evered ob&s;tinately in his
purpo&s;e; and finding him&s;elf unable to give battle to the
enemy, he marched northwards, with an intention of
prolonging the war, and of turning to his advantage the
&s;ituation of that mountainous and barren country.
When Warrenne advanced to Stirling, he found Wallace
encamped at Cambu&s;kenneth, on the oppo&s;ite banks of
the Forth; and being continually urged by the impatient
Cre&s;&s;ingham, who was actuated both by per&s;onal and
national animo&s;ities again&s;t the Scots<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Heming, vol. i. p. 127.</NOTE>, he prepared to at|tack
them in that po&s;ition, which Wallace, no le&s;s pru|dent
than courageous, had cho&s;en for his army<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">On the 11th of September 1297.</NOTE>. In
&s;pite of the remon&s;trances of Sir Richard Lundy, a Scot&s;|man
of birth and family, who &s;incerely adhered to the
Engli&s;h, he ordered his army to pa&s;s a bridge which lay
over the Forth; but he was &s;oon convinced, by fatal
experience, of the error of his conduct. Wallace, al|lowing
&s;uch numbers of the Engli&s;h to pa&s;s as he thought
proper, attacked them before they were fully formed,
put them to rout, pu&s;hed part of them into the river,
where they were drowned, de&s;troyed the re&s;t by the edge
of the &s;word, and obtained a complete victory over
them<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing. p. 73. Heming. vol. i. p. 127, 128, 129. Trivet, p. 307.</NOTE>. Among the &s;lain was Cre&s;&s;ingham him&s;elf,
who&s;e memory was &s;o extremely odious to the Scots,
that they flea'd his dead body, and made &s;addles and
girths of his &s;kin<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">$$ming. vol. i. p. 130.</NOTE>. Warrenne, finding the remainder
of his army much di&s;mayed by this misfortune, was
obliged again to evacuate the kingdom, and retire into
England. The ca&s;tles of Roxborough and Berwick, ill
fortified and feebly defended, fell &s;oon after into the
hands of the Scots.</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="340">
WALLACE, univer&s;ally revered as the deliverer of his
country, now received from the hands of his followers,
the dignity of regent or guardian under the captive
Baliol; and finding that the di&s;orders of war, as
well as the unfavourable &s;ea&s;ons, had produced a fa|mine
in Scotland, he urged his army to march into Eng|land,
to &s;ub&s;i&s;t at the expence of the enemy, and to re|venge
all pa&s;t injuries, by committing retaliations on that
ho&s;tile nation. The Scots, who deemed every thing
po&s;&s;ible under, &s;uch a leader, joyfully attended his call;
and Wallace, breaking into the northern counties dur|ing
the winter &s;ea&s;on, laid every place wa&s;te with fire
and &s;word; and after extending on all &s;ides, without
oppo&s;ition, the fury of his ravages, as far as the bi&s;hiopric
of Durham, he returned loaded with &s;poils, and crown|ed
with glory, into his own country<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 131, 131, 133.</NOTE>. The di&s;orders,
which at that time prevailed in England, from the re|fractory
behaviour of the con&s;table and mare&s;chal, made
it impo&s;&s;ible to collet an army &s;ufficient to re&s;i&s;t the ene|my,
and expo&s;ed the nation to this lo&s;s and di&s;honour.</P>
<P>BUT Edward, who received in Flanders intelligence
of the&s;e events, and had already concluded a truce with
France, now ha&s;tened over into England, in certain
hopes, by his activity and valour, not only of wiping off
this di&s;grace, but of recovering that important conque&s;t
of Scotland, which he always regarded as the chief glory
and advantage of his reign. He appea&s;ed the murmurs
of his people by conce&s;&s;ions and promi&s;es: He re&s;tored
to the citizens of London the election of their own ma|gi&s;trates,
of which they had been bereaved in the latter
part of his father's reign: He ordered &s;trict enquiry to
be made concerning the quantities of corn and other
goods, which had been violently &s;eized before his de|parture,
<PB N="314" REF="341">
parture, as if he intended to pay the value to the own|ers<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 813.</NOTE>:
And making public pro&s;e&s;&s;ions of confirming and
ob&s;erving the charters, he regained the confidence of the
di&s;contented nobles. Having by all the&s;e popular arts
rendered him&s;elf entirely ma&s;ter of his people, he collect|ed
the whole military force of England, Wales, and Ire|land;
and marched with an army of near an hundred
thou&s;and combatants to the northern frontiers.</P>
<P>NOTHING could have enabled the Scots to re&s;i&s;t, but
for one &s;ea&s;on, &s;o mighty a power, except an entire uni|on
among them&s;elves; but as they were deprived of their
King, who&s;e per&s;onal qualities, even when he was pre|fent,
appeared &s;o contemptible, and had left among his
&s;ubjects no principle of attachment to him or his family;
factions, jealou&s;ies, and animo&s;ities, unavoidably aro&s;e
among the great, and di&s;tracied all their councils. The
elevation of Wallace, tho' purcha&s;ed by &s;o great merit,
and &s;uch eminent &s;ervices, was the object of envy to the
nobility, who repined to &s;ee a private gentleman rai&s;ed
above them by his rank, and &s;till more, by his glory and
reputation. Wallace him&s;elf, &s;en&s;ible of their jealou&s;y,
and dreading the ruin of his country from tho&s;e inte&s;tine
di&s;cords, voluntarily re&s;igned his authority, and retained
only the command over that body of his followers, who,
being accu&s;tomed to victory under his &s;tandard, refu&s;ed
to follow into the field any other leader. The chief
power devolved on the &s;teward of Scotland, and Cummin
of Badenoch; men of eminent birth, under whom the
great chie&s;tans were more willing to &s;erve in defence of
their country. The two Scotti&s;h commanders, collect|ing
their &s;everal forces from every quarter, fixed their
&s;tation at Falkirk, and propo&s;ed there to abide the affault
of the Engli&s;h. Wallace was at the head of a third bo|dy,
which acted under his command. The Scots army
<PB N="315" REF="342">
placed the pikemen along their front: Interlined the in|tervals
between the three bodies with archers: And
dreading the great &s;uperiority of the Engli&s;h in cavalry,
endeavoured to &s;ecure their front by pali&s;adoes, tied to|gether
with ropes<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing. p. 75. Heming. vel. i. p. 163.</NOTE>. In this di&s;po&s;ition, they expected
the approach of the enemy.</P>
<P>THE King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">22d July&punc; Battle of Falkirk.</NOTE> when he arrived in &s;ight of the Scots,
was plea&s;ed with the pro&s;pect of being able, by one deci|&s;ive
&s;troke, to determine the fortune of the war; and
dividing his army al&s;o into three bodies, he led them to
the attack. The Engli&s;h archers, who began about
this time to &s;urpa&s;s tho&s;e of other nations, fir&s;t chaced
the Scotti&s;h bowmen off the field; and then pouring
in their arrows among the pikemen, who were cooped
up within their intrenchments, began to throw them into
di&s;order, and rendered the a&s;&s;ault of the Engli&s;h pikemen
and cavalry more ea&s;y and &s;ucce&s;sful. The whole Scot|ti&s;h
army was broke, and chaced off the field with great
&s;laughter; which the hi&s;torians, attending more to the
exaggerated relations of the populace, than to the pro|bability
of things, make amount to fifty or &s;ixty thou|&s;and
men<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing. p. 76. T. Wykes, p. 127. Heming. vol. i. p. 163, 164, 165. Trivet, p. 313, &s;ays only 20,000. M. We&s;t. p. 431, &s;ays 40,000.</NOTE>. It is only certain, that the Scots never
&s;uffered a greater lo&s;s in any action, nor one which &s;eemed
to threaten more inevitable ruin to their country.</P>
<P>IN this general rout of the army, Wallace's military
&s;kill and pre&s;ence of mind enabled him to keep his troops
together; and retiring behind the Carron, which lay in
his rear, he marched lei&s;urely along the banks of that
&s;mall river, which protected him from the enemy.
Young Bruce, who had already given many proofs of his
a&s;piring genius, but who &s;erved hitherto in the Engli&s;h
<PB N="316" REF="343">
army, appeared on the oppo&s;ite banks; and di&s;tingui&s;h|ing
the Scotti&s;h chieftain, as well by his maje&s;tic port,
as by the intrepid activity of his behaviour, called out
to him, and de&s;ired a &s;hort conference. He here repre|&s;ented
to Wallace the fruitle&s;s and ruinous enterprize in
which he was engaged; and endeavoured to per&s;uade
him to bend at la&s;t his inflexible &s;pirit to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion under
&s;uperior power and &s;uperior fortune: He in&s;i&s;ted on the
unequal conte&s;t between a weak &s;tate, deprived of its
head and agitated by inte&s;tine di&s;cord, and a mighty na|tion,
conducted by the able&s;t and mo&s;t martial monarch
of the age, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every re&s;ource either for
drawing out the war, or for pu&s;hing it with vigour and
activity: If the love of his country was his motive for
per&s;everance, his ob&s;tinacy tended only to prolong her
mi&s;ery; if he carried his views to private grandeur and
ambition, he might reflect, that, even if Edward &s;hould
withdraw his armies, it appeared from pa&s;t experience,
that &s;o many haughty nobles, proud of the pre-eminence
of their families, would never &s;ubmit to per&s;onal merit,
who&s;e &s;uperiority they were le&s;s inclined to regard as an
object of admiration, than as a reproach and injury to
them&s;elves. To the&s;e exhortations Wallace replied,
that if he had hitherto acted alone, as the champion of
his native country, it was &s;olely becau&s;e no &s;econd or
competitor, or what he rather wi&s;hed, no leader had as
yet appeared to place him&s;elf in that honourable &s;tation:
That the blame lay entirely on the nobility, and chiefly
on Bruce him&s;elf, who uniting per&s;onal merit to dignity
of family, had de&s;erted the po&s;t, which both nature and
fortune, by &s;uch powerful calls, invited him to a&s;&s;ume:
That the Scots, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch a head, would, by their
unanimity and concord, have &s;urmounted the chief dif|ficulty
under which they now laboured, and might hope,
notwith&s;tanding their pre&s;ent lo&s;&s;es, to oppo&s;e &s;ucce&s;s|fully
<PB N="317" REF="344">
all the abilities and power of Edward: That Hea|ven
it&s;elf could not &s;et a more glorious prize before the
eyes either of virtue or ambition, than to conjoin in one
object, the acqui&s;ition of royalty with the defence of na|tional
independence: And that as the intere&s;ts of his
country, no more than tho&s;e of a brave man, could ne|ver
be &s;incerely cultivated by a &s;acrifice of liberty, he
him&s;elf was determined, as far as po&s;&s;ible, to prolong,
not her mi&s;ery, but her freedom, and was de&s;irous, that
his own life, as well as the exi&s;tence of the nation, might
terminate, when they could no longer be pre&s;erved but
by receiving the chains of a haughty victor. The gal|lantry
of the&s;e &s;entiments, tho' delivered by an armed
enemy, &s;truck the generous mind of Bruce: The flame
was conveyed from the brea&s;t of one hero to that of an|other:
He repented of his engagements with Edward;
and opening his eyes to the honourable path, pointed out
to him by Wallace, &s;ecretly determined to &s;eize the fir&s;t
opportunity of embracing the cau&s;e, however de&s;perate,
of his oppre&s;&s;ed country<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">This &s;tory is told by all the Scots writers; tho' it mu&s;t be owned that Trivet and Hemingford, authors of good credit, both agree that Bruce was not in Edward's army.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE &s;ubjection of Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1299.</NOTE> notwith&s;tanding this
great victory of Edward, was not yet entirely completed.
The Engli&s;h army, after reducing all the &s;outhern pro|vinces,
was obliged to retire for want of provi&s;ions; and
left the northern counties in the hands of the natives.
The Scots, no le&s;s enraged with their pre&s;ent defeat,
than elevated by their pa&s;t victories, &s;till maintained the
conte&s;t for liberty; but being fully &s;en&s;ible of the great
inferiority of their forces, they endeavoured, by applica|tion
to foreign courts, to procure to them&s;elves &s;ome
a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The &s;upplications of the Scotti&s;h mini&s;ters
were rejected by Philip; but were more &s;ucce&s;sful with
<PB N="318" REF="345">
the court of Rome.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1300.</NOTE> Boniface, plea&s;ed with an occa&s;ion
of exerting his authority,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scotland a|gain &s;ubdu|ed.</NOTE> wrote a letter to Edward, ex|horting
him to put a &s;top to the oppre&s;&s;ions of Scotland
and di&s;playing all the proofs, &s;uch as they had probably
been furni&s;hed him by the Scots them&s;elves, for the anti|ent
independance of that kingdom<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 844. Wal&s;ing. p. 78, 80. Hemling. vol. i. p. 172. Trivet, p. 318. M. We&s;t. p. 435.</NOTE>. Among other
arguments, hinted at above, he mentioned the treaty
conducted and fini&s;hed by Edward him&s;elf, for the mar|riage
of his &s;on with the heire&s;s of Scotland; a treaty
which would have been ab&s;urd, had he been &s;uperior
lord of the kingdom, and had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the feudal law
the right of di&s;po&s;ing of his ward in marriage. He men|tioned
&s;everal other &s;triking facts, which fell within the
compa&s;s of Edward's own knowledge; particularly,
that Alexander, when he did homage to the king, open|ly
and expre&s;sly declared in his pre&s;ence, that he &s;wore
fealty not for his crown, but for the lands which he held
in England: And the Pope's letter might have paffed for
a very rea&s;onable one, had he not &s;ubjoined his own
claim to be liege lord of Scotland; a right, which had
never once been heard of, but which, with a &s;ingular
confidence, he a&s;&s;erted to be full, entire, and derived
from the mo&s;t remote antiquity. The affirmative &s;tyle,
which had been &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful with him and his predece&s;|&s;ors
in &s;piritual conte&s;ts, was never before abu&s;ed after
&s;o egregious a manner in any civil controver&s;y.</P>
<P>THE reply,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1301.</NOTE> which Edward wrote to Boniface's let|ter,

He there proves the &s;uperiority of England by hi&s;|torical
facts, deduced from Brutus, the Trojan, who,
he &s;aid, fir&s;t founded the Briti&s;h monarchy in the age of
<PB N="319" REF="346">
Eli and Samuel: He &s;upports his po&s;ition by all the
events which pa&s;&s;ed in the i&s;land before the arrival of the
Romans: And after laying great &s;tre&s;s on the exten&s;ive
dominion and heroic victories of King Arthur, he vouch|&s;afes
at la&s;t to de&s;cend to the times of Edward the elder,
with which, in his &s;peech to the &s;tates of Scotland,
he had cho&s;en to begin his claim of &s;uperiority. He a&s;&s;erts
it to be a fact, <HI>notorious and confirmed by the records of an|tiquity,</HI>
that the Engli&s;h monarchs had often conferred
the kingdom of Scotland on their own &s;ubjects; had de|throned
the&s;e va&s;&s;al kings when unfaithful to them; and
had &s;ub&s;tituted others in their place. He di&s;plays with
great pomp the full and complete homage which William
had done to Henry II; without mentioning the formal
abolition of that <HI>extorted</HI> deed by King Richard, and the

&s;ame time, however, they take care to inform Boniface,
that, tho' they had ju&s;tified their cau&s;e before him, they

all its royal prerogatives, and would never permit
the king him&s;elf, were he willing, to relinqui&s;h its inde|pendancy.</P>
<P>THAT neglect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1302.</NOTE> almo&s;t total, of truth and ju&s;tice,
which &s;overeign &s;tates di&s;cover in their tran&s;actions with
each other, is an evil inveterate in the world; is one
great &s;ource of the mi&s;ery to which the human &s;pecies is

continually expo&s;ed; and it may be doubted, whether in
many in&s;tances it is found in the end to contribute to the
intere&s;ts of tho&s;e princes them&s;elves, who thus &s;acrifice
their integrity to their politics. As few monarchs have
lain under &s;tronger temptations to violate the principles
of equity, than Edward in his tranfactions with Scot|land;
&s;o never were they violated with le&s;s &s;cruple and
re&s;erve: Yet his advantages were hitherto precarious and
uncertain; and the Scots, once rou&s;ed to arms and en|ured
to war, began to appear a formidable enemy, even
to this military and ambitious prince. They cho&s;e John
Cummin for their regent;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scotland again re|volts.</NOTE> and not content with main|taining
their independance in the northern parts, they
made incur&s;ions into the &s;outhern counties, which Ed|ward
imagined he had totally &s;ubdued. John de Se|grave,
whom he had left guardian of Scotland, led an
army to oppo&s;e them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1303.</NOTE> and lying at Ro&s;lin near Edin|burgh,
&s;ent out his forces in three divi&s;ions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">24th Feb.</NOTE> to provide
them&s;elves in forage and &s;ub&s;i&s;tance from the neighbour|hood.
One party was &s;uddenly attacked by the regent
and Sir Simon Fra&s;er; and being unprepared, were im|mediately
routed and pur&s;ued with great &s;laughter. The
few that e&s;caped, flying to the &s;econd divi&s;ion, gave
warning of the approach of the enemy: The &s;oldiers
ran to their colours: And were immediately led out to
take revenge for the death of their countrymen. The
Scots, elated with the advantage already obtained, ma$e
a vigorous impre&s;&s;ion upon them: The Engli&s;h, ani|mated
with vengeance, maintained a &s;tout re&s;i&s;tance:
The victory was long undecided between them; but at
la&s;t declared it&s;elf intirely in favour of the former, who
broke the Engli&s;h, and chaced them to trie third divi&s;ion,
now advancing with a ha&s;ty march to &s;upport their di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed
companions. Many of the Scots had fallen in
the two fir&s;t actions; mo&s;t of them were wounded; and
<PB N="321" REF="348">
all of them extremely fatigued by the long continuance of the combat:
Yet were they &s;o tran&s;ported with &s;uc|ce&s;s
and military rage, that, having &s;uddenly recovered
their order, and arming the followers of their camp with
the &s;poils of the &s;laughtered enemy, they drove with
fury upon the ranks of the di&s;mayed Engli&s;h. The
favourable moment decided the battle; which the Scots,
had they met with a &s;teady re&s;i&s;tance, were not long
able to maintain: The Engli&s;h were chaced off the
field: Three victories were thus gained in one day<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 197.</NOTE>:
And the renown of the&s;e great exploits, &s;econded by the
favourable di&s;po&s;itions of the people, &s;oon made the re|gent
ma&s;ter of all the fortre&s;&s;es in the &s;outh; and it be|came
nece&s;&s;ary for Edward to begin anew the conque&s;t
of the kingdom.</P>
<P>THE King prepared him&s;elf for this enterprize with
his u&s;ual vigour and ability. He a&s;&s;embled both a great
fleet and a great army; and entering the frontiers of
Scotland, appeared with a force, which the enemy could
not think of re&s;i&s;ting in the open field: The Engli&s;h
navy which &s;ailed along the coa&s;t, &s;ecured the army from
any danger of famine: Edward's vigilance pre&s;erved
them from &s;urprizes: And by this prudent di&s;po&s;ition they
marched victoriou&s;ly from one extremity of the kingdom
to the other, ravaging the open country, taking in all
the ca&s;tles<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 205.</NOTE>, and receiving the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions of all the no|bility,
even tho&s;e of Cummin the regent. The mo&s;t
ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance was made by the ca&s;tle of Brechin,
defended by Sir Thomas Maule; and the place opened
not its gates, till the death of the governor, by di&s;cou|raging
the garri&s;on, obliged them to &s;ubmit to the $ate,
which had overwhelmed the re&s;t of the kingdom.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is again &s;ubdued.</NOTE> Wal|lace,
tho' he attended the Engli&s;h army in their march,

found but few opportunities of &s;ignalizing that valour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1304.</NOTE>
which had formerly made him &s;o terrible to his enemies.</P>
<P>EDWARD, having compleated his conque&s;t which
employed him during the &s;pace of near two years, now
undertook the more difficult work, of &s;ettling the coun|try,
of e&s;tabli&s;hing a new form of government, and of
making his acqui&s;ition durable to the crown of England.
He &s;eems to have carried matters to extremity again&s;t
the natives: He abrogated all the Scotti&s;h laws and
cu&s;toms<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ryley, p. 506.</NOTE>: He endeavoured to &s;ub&s;titute the Engli&s;h in
their place: He entirely razed or de&s;troyed all the monu|ments
of antiquity: Such records or hi&s;tories as had
e&s;caped his former &s;earch were now burnt or di&s;per&s;ed:
And he ha&s;tened, by too precipitate &s;teps, to aboli&s;h en|tirely
the Scotti&s;h name, and to &s;ink it finally in the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>EDWARD,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1305.</NOTE> however, &s;till deemed his favourite con|que&s;t
expo&s;ed to &s;ome danger, &s;o long as Wallace was
alive; and being prompted both by revenge and policy,
he employed every art to di&s;cover his retreat, and become;
ma&s;ter of his per&s;on. At la&s;t, that hardy warrior, who
was determined, amid&s;t the univer&s;al &s;lavery of his
country-men, &s;till to maintain his independance, was
betrayed into Edward's hands by Sir John Monteith, his
friend, whom he had made acquainted with the place
of his concealment. The King, who&s;e natural bravery
&s;hould have induced him to re&s;pect like qualities in an
enemy, enraged at &s;ome violences committed by Wallace
during the fury of war<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing. p. 84. Heming. vol. i. p. 120.</NOTE>, re&s;olved to overawe the Scots
by an example of &s;everity; and he Ordered Wallace to
be carried up in chains to London;<NOTE PLACE="marg">23 Augu&s;t.</NOTE> to be tried as a re|bel
and traitor, tho' he never had made &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, nor

This was the unworthy fate of a hero, who,
thro' a cour&s;e of many years, had, with &s;ignal conduct,
intrepidity and per&s;everance, defended again&s;t a public
and oppre&s;&s;ive enemy, the liberties of his native country.</P>
<P>BUT the barbarous policy of Edward failed of the pur|po&s;e,
to which it was directed. The Scots, already di&s;|gu&s;ted
with the great innovations introduced by the
&s;word of a conqueror into their laws and government,
were farther enraged at the inju&s;tice and cruelty exerci&s;ed
upon Wallace; and all the envy, which, during his life|time,
had attended that gallant chie&s;tain, being now
buried in his grave, he was univer&s;ally regarded as the
champion of Scotland, and the patron of her expiring
independance. The people, inflamed with re&s;entment;
were every where di&s;po&s;ed to ri&s;e again&s;t the Engli&s;h go|vernment;
and it was not long before a new and more
fortunate leader pre&s;ented him&s;elf, who conducted them
to liberty, to victory, and to vengeance.</P>
<P>ROBERT BRUCE,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1306.</NOTE> the fan<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hemingford, vol. i. p. 218. calls him the grand&s;on of Robert; and is very particular in the account of the times in which his father and grandfather died. Hemingford is the be&s;t hi&s;torian of that age.</NOTE> of that Robert, who had
been one of the competitors for the crown,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Robert Bruce.</NOTE> had &s;ucceed|ed,
by his father's death, to all his preten&s;ions; and the
death of John Baliol, which happened nearly about the
&s;ame time in France, together with the captivity of
Edward, the elde&s;t &s;on of that prince, &s;eemed to open a
full career to the genius and ambition of this young
nobleman. He &s;aw, that the Scots, when the right to their
crown had expired in the males of their antient royal
family, had been divided into parties nearly equal be|tween
the hou&s;es of Bruce and Baliol; and that every
<PB N="324" REF="351">
incident, which had &s;ince happened, had tended to wean
them from any attachment to the latter. The &s;lender
capacity of John had proved unable to defend them a|gain&s;t
their enemies: He had meanly re&s;igned his crown
into the hands of the conqueror: He had, before his
delivery from captivity, re-iterated that re&s;ignation in a
manner &s;eemingly voluntary; and had in that act thrown
out many reflections extremely di&s;honourable to his anti|ent
&s;ubjects, whom he publickly called traitors, ruffians,
and rebels, and with whom, he declared, he was deter|mined
to maintain no farther connexions<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Brady's hi&s;t. vol. ii. App. N^o. 27.</NOTE>: He had,
during the time of his exile, adhered &s;trictly to that re|&s;olution;
and his &s;on, being a pri&s;oner, &s;eemed ill qua|lified
to revive the rights, now fully abandoned, of his
family. Bruce therefore hoped, that the Scots, &s;o long
expo&s;ed, from the want of a leader, to the oppre&s;&s;ions
of their enemies, would unanimou&s;ly fly to his &s;tandard,
and would &s;eat him on the vacant throne, to which he
brought &s;uch plau&s;ible preten&s;ions. His a&s;piring &s;pirit,
inflamed by the fervor of youth, and buoyed up by his
natural courage, &s;aw the glory alone of the enterprize,
or regarded the prodigious difficulties, which attended it,
as the &s;ource only of farther glory. The mi&s;eries and
oppre&s;&s;ions, which he had beheld his countrymen &s;uffer
in their unequal conte&s;t; the repeated defeats and mi&s;|fortunes,
which they had undergone, proved to him &s;o
many incentives to bring them relief, and conduct them
to revenge again&s;t the haughty victors. The circum&s;tan|ces,
which attended Bruce's fir&s;t declaration, are variou&s;ly
related; but we &s;hall rather follow the account given by
the Scots hi&s;torians; not that their authority is in general
any wi&s;e to be compared to that of the Engli&s;h; but be|cau&s;e
they may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;ometimes better in|formed
<PB N="325" REF="352">
concerning facts, which &s;o nearly intere&s;ted their
own nation.</P>
<P>BRUCE, who had long harboured in his brea&s;t the de|&s;ign
of freeing his en&s;laved country, ventured at la&s;t to
open his mind to John Cummin, a powerful nobleman,
with whom he lived in &s;trict intimacy. He found in his
friend all the appearance of his own &s;entiments; and
needed to employ no arts of per&s;ua&s;ion to make him em|brace
the re&s;olution of throwing off, on the fir&s;t favour|able
opportunity, the u&s;urped dominion of the Engli&s;h.
But on the departure of Bruce, who attended Edward
to London, Cummin, who either had di&s;&s;embled all along
with him, or began to reflect more coolly in his ab&s;ence
on the de&s;perate nature of the undertaking, re&s;olved to
attone for his crime of a&s;&s;enting to this rebellion, by the
merit of revealing the &s;ecret to the King of England.
Edward did not immediately commit Bruce to cu&s;tody;
becau&s;e he propo&s;ed, at the &s;ame time, to &s;eize his three
brothers, who re&s;ided in Scotland; and he contented
him&s;elf with &s;ecretly &s;etting &s;pies upon him, and order|ing
all his motions to be &s;trictly guarded. A nobleman
of Edward's court, Bruce's intimate friend, was appriz|ed
of his danger; but not daring, amid&s;t &s;o many watch|ful
eyes, to hold any conver&s;ation with him, he fell on an
expedient to give him warning, that it was full time
he &s;ould make his e&s;cape. He &s;ent him by a &s;ervant,
a pair of gilt &s;purs and a pur&s;e of gold, which he
pretended to have borrowed from him; and left it to
the &s;agacity of his friend to di&s;cover the meaning of the
pre&s;ent. Bruce immediately contrived the means of his
e&s;cape; and as the ground was at that time covered with
&s;now, he had the precaution, it is &s;aid, to order his hor&s;es
to be &s;hod with their &s;hoes turned backwards, that he
might deceive tho&s;e, who &s;ould track his path over the
<PB N="326" REF="353">
open fields or cro&s;s roads, thro' which he purpo&s;ed to
travel. He arrived in a few days at Dumfries in Annan|dale;
the chief &s;eat of his family intere&s;t; and he hap|pily
found a great number of the Scotti&s;h nobility there
a&s;&s;embled, and among the re&s;t, John Cummin, his for|mer
a&s;&s;ociate.</P>
<P>THE noblemen were a&s;toni&s;hed at the appearance of
Bruce in their company;<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th Feb.</NOTE> and &s;till more when he di&s;|covered
to them the object of his journey. He told
them, that he was come to live or die with them in de|fence
of the liberty of his country, and hoped, with their
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to redeem the Scotti&s;h name from all the in|dignities,
which it had &s;o long &s;uffered from the tyranny
of their imperious ma&s;ters: That the &s;acrifice of the
rights of his family was the fir&s;t injury which had pre|pared
the way for their en&s;uing &s;lavery; and by re&s;um|ing
them, which was his firm purpo&s;e, he opened to
them the joyful pro&s;pect of recovering from the fraudu|lent
u&s;urper their antient and hereditary independance:
That all their pa&s;t misfortunes had proceeded from their
di&s;union; and they would &s;oon appear no le&s;s formid|able
than of old to their enemies, if they now deigned
to follow into the field their rightful prince, who knew
no medium between death and victory: That their
mountains and their valour, which had, during &s;o many
ages, protected their liberty from all the efforts of the
Roman empire, would &s;till be &s;ufficient, were they
worthy of their generous ance&s;tors, to defend them a|gain&s;t
the utmo&s;t violence of the Engli&s;h tyrant: That
it was unbecoming men, born to the mo&s;t antient inde|pendance,
known in Europe, to &s;ubmit to the will of any
ma&s;ters; but fatal to receive tho&s;e, who, being irritated
by &s;uch per&s;evering oppo&s;ition, and enflamed with the
highe&s;t animo&s;ity, would never deem them&s;elves &s;ecure
of their u&s;urped dominion but by exterminating all the
<PB N="327" REF="354">
antient nobility, and even all the antient inhabitants:
And that, being reduced to this de&s;perate extremity, it
were better for them at once to peri&s;h, like brave men,
with their &s;words in their hands, than to dread long, and
at la&s;t undergo, the fate of the unfortunate Wallace,
who&s;e merits, in the brave and ob&s;tinate defence of his
country, were finally rewarded by the hands of an Eng|li&s;h
executioner.</P>
<P>THE &s;pirit with which this di&s;cour&s;e was delivered,
the bold &s;entiments which it conveyed, the novelty of
Bruce's declaration, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the graces of his youth
and manly deportment, made deep impre&s;&s;ion on the
minds of his audience, and rouzed all tho&s;e principles of
indignation and revenge, with which they had long been
&s;ecretly actuated. The Scotti&s;h nobles declared their
unanimous re&s;olution to u&s;e the utmo&s;t efforts in deliver|ing
their country from bondage, and to &s;econd the cou|rage
of Bruce, in a&s;&s;erting his and their undoubted
rights, again&s;t their common oppre&s;&s;ors. Cummin alone,
who had &s;ecretly taken his mea&s;ures with the King, op|po&s;ed
this general determination; and by repre&s;enting the
great power of England, governed by a prince of &s;uch
uncommon vigour and abilities, he endeavoured to &s;et be|fore
them the certain de&s;truction, which they mu&s;t ap|prehend,
if they again violated their oaths of fealty,
and &s;hook off their allegiance to the victorious Edward<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">M. We&s;t. p. 453&middot;</NOTE>.
Bruce, already apprized of his treachery, and for&s;eeing
the certain failure of all his own &s;chemes of ambition
and glory from the oppo&s;ition of &s;o potent a leader, took
immediately his re&s;olution; and moved partly by re&s;ent|ment,
partly by policy, followed Cummin on the di&s;&s;o|lution
of the a&s;&s;embly, attacked him in the cloy&s;ters of
the Grey Friars thro' which he pa&s;&s;ed, and running him
<PB N="328" REF="355">
thro' the body, left him for dead. Sir Thomas Kirkpa|tric,
one of Bruce's friends, a&s;king him &s;oon after, if the
traitor was &s;lain; <HI>I believe &s;o,</HI> replied Bruce. <HI>And is that
a matter,</HI> cried Kirkpatric, <HI>to be left to conjecture? I will &s;e|cure
him.</HI> Upon which he drew his dagger, ran to Cum|min,
and &s;tabbed him to the heart. This deed of Bruce
and his a&s;&s;ociates, which contains circum&s;tances, ju&s;tly
condemned by our pre&s;ent manners, was regarded in that
age as an effort of manly vigour and ju&s;t policy. The
family of Kirkpatric took for the cre&s;t of their arms,
which they &s;till wear, a hand with a bloody dagger:
And cho&s;e for their motto the&s;e words, <HI>I will &s;ecure him;</HI>
the expre&s;&s;ion employed by their ance&s;tor, when he exe|cuted
that violent action.</P>
<P>THE murder of Cummin affixed the &s;eal to the con|&s;piracy
of the Scotti&s;h nobles:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Third re|volt of Scotland.</NOTE> They had now no re|&s;ource
left but to &s;hake off the yoke of England, or to
peri&s;h in the attempt: The genius of the nation rouzed
it&s;elf from its pre&s;ent dejection: And Bruce, flying to
different quarters, excited his partizans to arms, attacked
with &s;ucce&s;s the di&s;per&s;ed bodies of the Engli&s;h, got po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of many of the ca&s;tles, and having made his au|thority
be acknowledged in mo&s;t parts of the kingdom,
was &s;olemnly crowned and inaugurated in the abbey of
Scone by the bi&s;hop of St. Andrews, who had zealou&s;ly
embraced his cau&s;e. The Engli&s;h were again chaced
out of the kingdom, except &s;uch as took &s;helter in the
&s;trong fortre&s;&s;es that remained in their hands; and Ed|ward
found, that the Scots, twice conquered in his reign,
and often defeated, mu&s;t yet be anew &s;ubdued. Not di&s;|couraged
with the&s;e unexpected difficulties, he &s;ent Ay|mer
de Valence with a con&s;iderable force into Scotland
to check the progre&s;s of the in&s;urgents; and that gene|ral,
falling unexpectedly upon Bruce at Methven in
Perth&s;hire, threw his army into &s;uch di&s;order, as ended
<PB N="329" REF="356">
in a total defeat<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing. p. 91. Heming. vol. i. p. 222, 223. Trivet. p, 344.</NOTE>. Bruce fought with the mo&s;t heroic
courage, was thrice di&s;mounted from his hor&s;e in the action,
and as often recovered him&s;elf; but was at la&s;t obliged
to yield to &s;uperior fortune, and take &s;helter with a few
followers in the we&s;tern i&s;les. The earl of Athole, Sir
Simon Fra&s;er, and Sir Chri&s;topher Seton, who had been
taken pri&s;oners, were ordered by Edward to be executed
as rebels and traitors<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 223. M. We&s;t. p. 456.</NOTE>. Many other acts of rigour were
exerci&s;ed by him;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1307.</NOTE> and that prince, vowing revenue
again&s;t the whole Scotti&s;h nation, whom he deemed in|corrigible
in their aver&s;ion to his government, a&s;&s;embled a
great army, and was preparing to enter the frontiers, &s;ecure
of &s;ucce&s;s, and determined to make the defencele&s;s Scots
the victims of his &s;everity: When he unexpectedly
&s;ickened and died at Carli&s;le; enjoining, with his la&s;t
breath his &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or to pro&s;ecute the enterprize,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death 7th July.</NOTE>
and never to de&s;i&s;t till he had finally &s;ubdued the king|dom
of Scotland. He expired in the &s;ixty-ninth year
of his age, and the thirty-fifth of his reign, hated by his
neighbours, but extremely re&s;pected and revered by his
own &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>THE enterprizes fini&s;hed by this prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and cha|racter of the King.</NOTE> and the pro|jects
which he formed and brought very near to a con|clu&s;ion,
were more prudent, more regularly conducted,
and more advantageous to the &s;olid intere&s;ts of his king|dom
than tho&s;e which were undertaken in any reign
either of his ance&s;tors or his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. He re&s;tored au|thority
to the government, di&s;ordered by the weaken&s;s
of his father; he maintained the laws again&s;t all the
efforts of his turbulent barons; he fully annexed to his
crown the principality of Wales; he took the wi&s;e&s;t
and mo&s;t effectual mea&s;ures for reducing Scotland to a
like condition; and tho' the equity of this latter enter|prize
<PB N="330" REF="357">
may rea&s;onably be que&s;tioned, the circum&s;tances
of the two kingdoms promi&s;ed &s;uch certain &s;ucce&s;s,
and the advantage was &s;o vi&s;ible of uniting the whole i&s;land
under one head, that tho&s;e who give great indulgence to
rea&s;ons of &s;tate in the mea&s;ures of princes, will not be
apt to regard this part of his conduct with much &s;everity.
But Edward, however exceptionable his character may
appear on the head of ju&s;tice, is the model of a politic
and warlike King: He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed indu&s;try, penetration,
courage, vigour, and enterprize: He was frugal in all
expences that were not nece&s;&s;ary; he knew how to open
the public trea&s;ures on a proper occa&s;ion; he puni&s;hed
criminals with &s;everity; he was gracious and affable to
his &s;ervants and courtiers; and being of a maje&s;tic figure,
expert at all bodily exerci&s;es, and in the main well pro|portioned
in his limbs, notwithstanding the great length
and the &s;mallne&s;s of his legs, he was as well qualified to
captivate the populace by his exterior appearance, as to
gain the approbation of men of &s;en&s;e by his more &s;olid
virtues.</P>
<P>BUT the chief advantage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mi&s;cellane|ous tran&s;ac|tions of this reign.</NOTE> which the people of Eng|land
reaped, and &s;till continue to reap, from the reign
of this great prince, was the correction, exten&s;ion,
amendment, and e&s;tabli&s;hment of the laws, which Ed|ward
maintained in great vigour, and left much im|proved
to po&s;terity: For the work of wife legislators
commonly remain; while the acqui&s;itions of conquerors
often peri&s;h with them. This merit has ju&s;tly gained
to Edward the appellation of the Engli&s;h Ju&s;tinian. Not
only the numerous &s;tatutes, pa&s;&s;ed in his reign, touch
the chief points of juri&s;prudence, and, according to Sir
Edward Coke<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">In&s;titute, p. 156.</NOTE>, truly de&s;erve the name of e&s;tabli&s;hments,
becau&s;e they were more con&s;tant, &s;landing, and durable
laws than any made &s;ince; but the regular order of his
<PB N="331" REF="358">
admini&s;tration gave an opportunity to the common law
to refine it&s;elf, and brought the judges to a certainty in
their determinations, and the lawyers to a preci&s;ion in
their pleadings. Sir Matthew Hale has remarked the
&s;udden improvement of Engli&s;h law during this reign;
and ventures to a&s;&s;ert, that, till his own time, it had
never received any con&s;iderable encrea&s;e<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;tory of the Engli&s;hlaw, p. 158, 163.</NOTE>. Edward &s;et|tled
the juri&s;diction of the &s;everal courts; fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed
the office of ju&s;tice of peace; ab&s;tained from the prac|tice
too common before him, of interrupting ju&s;tice by
mandates from the privy council<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Articuli &s;uper Cart. cap. 6. Edward enacted a law to this pur|po&s;e; but it is very doubtful, whether he ever ob&s;erved it. We are &s;ure that &s;carce any of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors did. The multitude of the&s;e let|ters of protection were a ground of complaint by the commons in 3 Edw II. See Ryley, p. 525. This practice is declared illegal by the &s;tatute of Northampton pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;econd of Edward III. but &s;till con|tinued, like many other abu&s;es. There are in&s;tances of it &s;o late as the reign of Queen Elizabeth.</NOTE>; repre&s;&s;ed robberies
and di&s;orders<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Statue of Winton.</NOTE>; encouraged trade by giving merchants
an ea&s;y way of recovering their debts<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Satute of Acton Burnel.</NOTE>; and in &s;hort, in|troduced
a new face of things by the vigour and wi&s;dom,
of his government. As law began now to be well e&s;ta|bli&s;hed,
the abu&s;e of that happine&s;s began al&s;o to be re|marked.
In&s;tead of their former a&s;&s;ociations for robbery
and violence, men entered into formal combinations to
&s;upport each other in law-&s;uits; and it was found re|qui&s;ite
to check this grievance by act of parliament<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Statute of Con&s;pirators.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE happened in this reign a con&s;iderable altera|tion
in the execution of the laws: The King aboli&s;hed
the office of chief judiciary, which he thought po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
too much power, and was dangerous to the crown<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Spelman, Glo&s;&s;. in verbo <HI>iu&s;ticiarius.</HI> Gilbert's Hi&s;t, of the Exchequer, p. 8.</NOTE>:
<PB N="332" REF="359">
He compleated the divi&s;ion of the court of exchequer
into four di&s;tinct courts, which managed, each, its &s;eve|ral
branch, without dependance on any one magistrate;
and as the lawyers invented a method, by means of their
fictions, to carry bu&s;ine&s;s from one court to another, the
&s;everal courts became rivals and checks to each other;
a circum&s;tance which tended much to improve the prac|tice
of the law in England.</P>
<P>BUT tho' Edward appeared thus, thro' his whole
reign, a friend to law and ju&s;tice, it cannot be &s;aid, that
he was an enemy to arbitrary power, and in a govern|ment
more regular and legal than was that of England
in his age, &s;uch practices as tho&s;e which may be re|marked
in his admini&s;tration, would have given &s;uffi|cient
ground of complaint, and &s;ometimes were even in
his age the object of general di&s;plea&s;ure. The violent
plunder and bani&s;hment of the Jews; the putting the
whole clergy, at once, out of the protection of law;
the &s;eizing all the wool and leather of the kingdom;
the heightening the impo&s;itions on the former valuable
commodity; the new and illegal commi&s;&s;ion of Trail|ba&s;ton
the taking all the money and plate of mona&s;|teries
and churches, even before he had any quarrel
with the clergy; the &s;ubjecting every man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
twenty pounds a year to military &s;ervice, tho' not bound
to it by his tenure; his vi&s;ible reluctance to confirm the
great charter, as if that conce&s;&s;ion had no validity from
the deeds of his predece&s;&s;ors; the captious clau&s;e which
he at la&s;t annexed to his confirmation; his procuring,
after all, the Pope's di&s;pen&s;ation from the oaths which
he had taken to ob&s;erve that charter; and his levying of
arbitrary talliages even after the &s;tatute, or rather charter,
by which he had renounced that prerogative; the&s;e are
<PB N="333" REF="360">
&s;o many demon&s;trations of his arbitrary di&s;po&s;ition, and
prove with what exception and re&s;erve we ought to cele|brate
his love of ju&s;tice. He took care that his &s;ubjects
&s;hould do ju&s;tice to one another; but he de&s;ired always
to have his own hands free in all his transactions, both
with them and with his neighbours.</P>
<P>THE chief ob&s;truction to the execution of ju&s;tice in
tho&s;e times was the power of the great barons; and Ed|ward
was perfectly qualified, by his character and abili|ties,
to keep the&s;e tyrants in awe, and to re&s;train their
illegal practices. This &s;alutary purpo&s;e was accordingly
the great object of his attention; yet he was imprudently
led into a mea&s;ure which tended very much to encrea&s;e
and confirm their exorbitant authority. He pa&s;&s;ed a
&s;tatute, which, by allowing them to entail their e&s;tates,
made it impracticable to dimini&s;h the property of the
great families, and left them all means of encrea&s;e and
acqui&s;ition<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Brady of boroughs, p. 25, from the records.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>EDWARD ob&s;erved a contrary policy with regard to
the church: He &s;eems to have been the fir&s;t chri&s;tian
prince who pa&s;&s;ed a &s;tatute of mortmain; and prevented
by law the clergy from making new acqui&s;itions of lands,
which by the eccle&s;ia&s;tical canons they were for ever pro|hibited
to alienate. The oppo&s;ition between his maxims
with regard to the nobility and eccle&s;ia&s;tics, leads us to
conjecture, that it was only by chance he pa&s;&s;ed the be|neficial
&s;tatute of mortmain, and that his &s;ole object was,
to maintain the number of knights fees, and to prevent
the &s;uperiors from being defrauded of the profits of ward|&s;hip,
marriage, livery, and other emoluments ari&s;ing
from the feudal tenures. This is indeed the rea&s;on
a&s;&s;igned in the &s;tatute it&s;elf, and appears to have been his
real object in enacting it. The author of the annals of
<PB N="334" REF="361">
Waverly a&s;cribes this act chie&s;ly to the King's anxiety
for maintaining the military force of the kingdom; but
adds that he was much mi&s;taken in his purpo&s;e; for that
the Amalekites were overcome more by the prayers of
Mo&s;es than by the &s;word of the I&s;raelites<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">P. 234. So al&s;o M. We&s;t. p. 409.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>EDWARD was very active in re&s;training the u&s;urpa|tions
of the church, and excepting his ardour for Cru|&s;ades,
which adhered to him during his whole life, &s;eems,
in other re&s;pects, to have been little infected with &s;upper|&s;tition,
the vice chiefly of weak minds. But the pa&s;&s;ion
for Cru&s;ades was really in that age the pa&s;&s;ion for glory,
As the Pope now felt him&s;elf &s;omewhat more re&s;trained
in his former practice of pillaging the national churches
by general impo&s;itions upon them, he permitted the ge|nerals
of particular orders, who re&s;ided at Rome, to levy
taxes on the &s;everal convents &s;ubjected to their juri&s;tic|tion;
and Edward was obliged to enact a law again&s;t
this new abu&s;e. It was al&s;o become a prance of the
court of Rome to provide &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to benefices before
they became vacant: Edward found it likewi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary
to re&s;train by law this &s;ource of inju&s;tice and impo&s;ition.</P>
<P>THE tribute of 1000 marks a year, to which King John,
in doing homage to the Pope, had &s;ubjected the king|dom,
had been pretty regularly paid &s;ince his time, tho'
the va&s;&s;alage was con&s;tantly denied, and indeed, for fear
of giving offence, had been but little in&s;i&s;ted on. The
payment was called by a new name of <HI>census,</HI> not by
that of tribute. King Edward &s;eems to have always
paid this money with great reluctance, and he &s;uffered
the arrears, at one time, to run on for &s;ix years<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 77, 107.</NOTE>, at
another for eleven<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 862.</NOTE>: But as princes in that age stood
continually in need of the Pope's good offices, for di&s;|pen&s;ations
of marriages and other conce&s;&s;ions, the court
<PB N="335" REF="362">
of Rome found always means, &s;ooner or latter, to catch
the money. The levying of fir&s;t fruits was al&s;o a, new
device, begun in this reign, by which his holine&s;s got
his fingers very frequently into the pur&s;es of the faithful;
and the King &s;eems unwarily to have given way to it.</P>
<P>EDWARD had by his fir&s;t wife, Eleanor of Ca&s;tile,
four &s;ons, but Edward his heir and &s;ucce&s;&s;or, was the
only one that &s;urvived him. She al&s;o bore him eleven
daughters, mo&s;t of whom died in their infancy: Joan
was married fir&s;t to the earl of Gloce&s;ter, and after his
death, to Ralph de Monthermer: Margaret e&s;pou&s;ed
John duke of Brabant: Elizabeth e&s;pou&s;ed fir&s;t John
earl of Holland; and afterwards the earl of Hereford:
Mary was a nun at Ambre&s;bury. He had by his &s;econd
wife, Margaret of France, two &s;ons and a daughter;
Thomas created earl of Norfolk, and Mare&s;chal of Eng|land;
and Edmond who was created earl of Kent by
his brother when King. The prince&s;s died in her in|fancy.</P>
<P>IN the former reign the taxes had been partly &s;cu|tages,
partly a proportional part of the moveables, granted
by parliament: In this, &s;cutages were entirely dropt;
and the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment on moveables was the chief method of
taxation. Edward in his fourth year had a fifteenth
granted him; in his fifth year a twelfth; in his eleventh
year a thirtieth from the laity, a twentieth from the
clergy; in his eighteenth year a fifteenth; in his twenty
&s;econd year a tenth from the laity, a &s;ixth from London
and other corporate towns, half of their benefices from
the clergy; in his twenty third year an eleventh from
the barons and others, a tenth from the clergy, a &s;eventh
from the burge&s;&s;es; in his twenty fourth year a twelfth
from the barons and others, an eighth from the burge&s;&s;es,
from the clergy, nothing, becau&s;e of the Pope's inhibit|tion;
in his twenty fifth year an eighth from the laity,
<PB N="336" REF="363">
a tenth from the clergy of Canterbury, a fifth from tho&s;e of
York; in his twenty ninth year a fifteenth from the laity,
on account of his confirming the perambulation of the
fore&s;ts; the clergy granted nothing; in his thirty third
year, fir&s;t a thirtieth from the barons and others, and a
twentieth from the burge&s;&s;es, then a fifteenth from all
his &s;ubjects; in his thirty fourth year a thirtieth from all
his &s;ubjects for knighting his elde&s;t &s;on.</P>
<P>THESE taxes were moderate; but the King had al&s;o
duties upon exportation and importation granted him
from time to time: The heavie&s;t was commonly upon
wool. Poundage, or a &s;hilling a pound, was not regu|larly
granted the Kings for life till the reign of Henry V.</P>

<P>THE prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XIV.</NOTE> entertained in favour of young
Edward, kept the Engli&s;h from being fully &s;en|&s;ible
of the extreme lo&s;s, which they had &s;u&s;tained by
the death of the great monarch, who filled the throne;
and all men ha&s;tened with alacrity to take the oath of
allegiance to his &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or. This prince was in
the twenty-third year of his age, was of an agreeable
figure, of a mild and gentle di&s;po&s;ition, and having ne|ver
di&s;covered a propen&s;ity to any dangerous vice, it was
very natural to progno&s;ticate tranquillity and happine&s;s
from his government.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Weakne&s;s of the King.</NOTE> But the fir&s;t act of his reign
bla&s;ted all the&s;e hopes, and &s;hewed him to be totally un|qualified
for that perilous &s;ituation, in which every Eng|li&s;h
monarch during tho&s;e ages, had, from the un&s;table
form of the con&s;titution, and the turbulent di&s;po&s;itions
of the people, derived from it, the misfortune to be
placed. The indefatigable Robert Bruce, tho' his army
had been di&s;&s;ipated and he him&s;elf had been obliged to
<PB N="338" REF="365">
take &s;helter in the we&s;tern i&s;les, remained not long in
tranquillity; but before the death of the late King, had
&s;allied from his retreat, had again collected his followers,
had appeared in the field, and had obtained by &s;urprize
an important advantage over Aymer de Valence, who
commanded the Engli&s;h forces<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. 346.</NOTE>. He was now become &s;o
con&s;iderable as to have afforded the King of England
&s;uffcient glory in &s;ubduing him, without incurring any
danger of his &s;eeing all tho&s;e mighty preparations, made
by his father, fail in the enterprize. But Edward, in&s;tead
of pur&s;uing his advantages, marched but a little way
into Scotland; and having an utter incapacity, and equal
aver&s;ion for all application or &s;erious bu&s;ine&s;s, he imme|diately
returned upon his foot&s;teps, and di&s;per&s;ed his
army. His grandees perceived from this conduct, that the
authority of the crown, fallen into &s;uch feeble hands,
was no longer to be dreaded, and that every in&s;olence
might be praci&s;ed by them with impunity.</P>
<P>THE next mea&s;ure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His pa&s;&s;ion for favour|ites.</NOTE> taken by Edward, gave them an
inclination to attack tho&s;e prerogatives, which no longer
kept them in awe. There was one Piers Gava&s;ton,
the &s;on of a Ga&s;con knight of &s;ome di&s;tinction, who had
honourably &s;erved the late King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Piers Gava|&s;ton.</NOTE> and who, in reward of
his merits, had obtained an e&s;tabli&s;hment for his &s;on in
the family of the prince of Wales. This young man
&s;oon in&s;inuated him&s;elf into the affections of his ma&s;ter,
by his agreeable behaviour, and by &s;upplying him with
all tho&s;e innocent, tho' frivolous amu&s;ements, which
&s;uited his capacity and his inclinations. He was endow|ed
with the utmo&s;t elegance of &s;hape and per&s;on, was
noted for a fine mien and ea&s;y carriage, di&s;tingui&s;hed
him&s;elf in all warlike and genteel exerci&s;es, and was
celebrated for tho&s;e quick &s;allies of wit, by which his
country is di&s;tingui&s;hed. By all the&s;e accompli&s;hments
<PB N="339" REF="366">
he gained &s;o entire an a&s;cendant over young Edward,
who&s;e heart was &s;trongly di&s;po&s;ed to friend&s;hip and con|fidence,
that the late King, apprehen&s;ive of the con&s;e|quences,
had bani&s;hed him the kingdom, and had, be|fore
he died, made his &s;on promi&s;e never to recall him<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing. p. 95. Ypod. Neu&s;t. p. 499. Trivet, cont. p. 2.</NOTE>.
But he no &s;ooner found him&s;elf ma&s;ter, as he vainly ima|gined,
than he &s;ent for Gava&s;ton, and even before his
arrival at court, endowed him with the whole earldom,
of Cornwal, which had e&s;cheated to the crown, by the
death of Edmond, &s;on of Richard King of the Romans<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iii. p. 1. Heming. vol. i. p. 243. Wal&s;ing. p. 96. Ypod. Neu&s;t. p. 499. Trivet, cont. p. 2.</NOTE>.
Not content with conferring on him tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions,
which had &s;ufficed as an appanage for a prince of the
blood, he daily loaded him with new honours and riches;
married him to his own niece, &s;i&s;ter of the earl of Glo|ce&s;ter<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 245. Ypod. Neu&s;t. p. 500. T. de la More, p. 593.</NOTE>,

dignity, but as it enabled him to exalt to the highe&s;t
&s;plendor this object of his fond affections.</P>
<P>THE haughty barons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;content of the ba|rons.</NOTE> offended at the &s;uperiority of a

as much inferior to their own, concealed not their di&s;con|tent;
and &s;oon found rea&s;ons to ju&s;tify their animo&s;ity
in the character and conduct of the man they hated. In|&s;tead
of di&s;arming envy by the moderation and mode&s;ty
of his behaviour, Gava&s;ton di&s;played his power and in|fluence
with the utmo&s;t o&s;tentation; and deemed no cir|cum&s;tance
of his good fortune &s;o agreeable as its enabling
him to eclip&s;e and mortify all his rivals. He was vain|glorious,
profu&s;e, rapacious; fond of exterior pomp
and appearance, giddy with pro&s;perity; and as he ima|gined,
that his fortune was now as &s;trongly rooted in
the kingdom, as his a&s;cendant was uncontrouled over the
<PB N="340" REF="367">
weak monarch, he took no farther care of engaging par|tizans,
who might &s;upport his &s;udden and ill e&s;tabli&s;hed
grandeur. At all tournaments, he took delight in foil|ing
the Engli&s;h nobility, by his fuperior addre&s;s: In
each conver&s;ation, he made them the object of his wit

on his return with his young queen, renewed all the
proofs of that fond attachment to his favourite, of which
every one &s;o loudly complained. This prince&s;s was of
an imperious and intriguing &s;pirit; and finding, that her
hu&s;band's capacity required, as well as his temper in|clined,
him to be governed, &s;he thought her&s;elf be&s;t in|titled,
on every account, to perform the office, and &s;he contracted a mortal hatred again&s;t the per&s;on, who had
di&s;appointed her in the&s;e expectations. She was well
plea&s;ed, therefore, to &s;ee a combination of the nobility

age were annexed to landed property. He was turbu|lent
and factious in his di&s;po&s;ition; mortally hated the
favourite, who&s;e influence with the King exceeded his
own; and he &s;oon became the head of that party among
the barons, who de&s;ired tbe depre&s;&s;ion of this in&s;olent
&s;tranger. The confederated nobles bound them&s;elves by
oath, to expel Gava&s;ton: Both &s;ides began already to
put them&s;elves in a warlike po&s;ture: The licentiou&s;ne&s;s
of the age broke out in robberies and other di&s;orders, the
u&s;ual preludes of civil war: And the royal authority,
de&s;pi&s;ed in the King's own hands, and hated in tho&s;e of
Gava&s;ton, became in&s;ufficient for the execution of the
laws, and the maintenance of peace in the kingdom. A

<P>MEANWHILE, the King, le&s;s &s;hocked with the ille|gal
violence which had been impo&s;ed upon him, than unhappy in the ab&s;ence of his minion, employed every
expedient to &s;often the oppo&s;ition of the barons to his
return; as if &s;ucce&s;s in that point were the chief object of
his government. The high office of hereditary &s;teward was conferred on Lanca&s;ter: His father-in-law, the earl
of Lincoln, was bought off by other conce&s;&s;ions: Earl
Warrenne was al&s;o molli&s;ied by civilities, grants or pro|mi
&s;es: The in&s;olence of Gava&s;ton, being no longer be|fore
men's eyes, was le&s;s the object of general indigna|tion:
And Edward, deeming matters &s;ufficiently pre|pared
for his purpo&s;e, applied to the court of Rome, and
obtained a di&s;pen&s;ation from that oath, which the barons
had compelled Gava&s;ton to take, that he would abjure
for ever the realm<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iii. p. 167.</NOTE>. He went down to Che&s;ter, to
receive him on his fir&s;t landing from Ireland; flew into
his arms with tran&s;ports of joy; and having obtained the
formal con&s;ent of the barons in parliament to his re-e&s;ta|blimment,
&s;et no longer any bounds to his extravagant
fondne&s;s and affection. Gava&s;ton him&s;elf, forgetting
his pa&s;t misfortunes, and blind to their cau&s;es, re&s;umed
the &s;ame o&s;tentation and in&s;olence; and became more
than ever the object of general dete&s;tation among the
barons.</P>
<P>THE nobility fir&s;t di&s;covered their animo&s;ity by ab|&s;enting
them&s;elves from parliament; and finding, that
this expedient had not been &s;ucce&s;sful, they began to
think of employing &s;harper and more effectual remedies.

Tho' there had &s;carce been any other national ground of
complaint, except &s;ome di&s;&s;ipation of the public trea&s;ure:
Tho' all the acts of mal-admini&s;tration, objected to the
King, and his favourite, &s;eemed of a nature more pro|per
to excite heart-burnings in a ball or a&s;&s;embly, than
commotions in a great kingdom: Yet &s;uch was the &s;itu|ation
of the times, that the barons were determined,
and were able, to make them the rea&s;ons of a total al|teration
in the con&s;titution and civil government. Hav|ing
come to parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">7th Feb.</NOTE> in defiance of the laws and
the King's prohibition, with a numerous retinue of
armed followers, they found them&s;elves entirely ma&s;ters;
and pre&s;ented a petition, which was equivalent to a com|mand,
requiring Edward to devolve on a cho&s;en junto
the whole authority both of the crown and of the par|liament.<NOTE PLACE="marg">16th March</NOTE>
The King was obliged to &s;ign a commi&s;&s;ion,
empowering the prelates and barons to elect twelve per|&s;ons,
who &s;hould, till the term of Michaelmas in the
year following, have authority to enact ordinances, for
the government of the kingdom, and the regulation of
the King's hou&s;hold; con&s;enting that the&s;e ordinances
&s;hould thenceforth and for ever have the force of laws
and &s;tatutes; allowing the ordainers to form a&s;&s;ociations
among them&s;elves and their friends, for their &s;trict: and
regular ob&s;ervance; and all this for the greater glory of
God, the &s;ecurity of the church, and the honour and
advantage of the king and kingdom<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Brady's App. N^o. 50. Heming. vol. i. p. 247. Wal&s;ing. p. 97. Ryley, p. 526.</NOTE>. The barons in
return &s;igned a declaration, in which they acknowledged,
that they owed the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions merely to the King's
free bounty; promi&s;ed that this &s;hould never be drawn
into precedent; and engaged, that the power of the
ordainers &s;hould expire at the term appointed<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Brady's App. N^o. 51.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="371">
THE cho&s;en junto of twelve accordingly framed their
ordinances,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1311.</NOTE> and pre&s;ented them to the King and parlia|ment;
for their confirmation in the en&s;uing year. Some
of the&s;e ordinances were laudable, and tended to the re|gular
execution of ju&s;tice: Such as tho&s;e, requiring
&s;heriffs to be men of property, aboli&s;hing the practices
of i&s;&s;uing privy &s;eals for the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of ju&s;tice; re|&s;training the practice of purveyance, prohibiting the adul|teration
or alteration of the coin, excluding foreigners
from the farms of the revenue, ordering all payments to
be regularly made into the exchequer, revoking all late
grants of the crown, and giving the parties damages in
the ca&s;e of vexatious pro&s;ecutions. But what chiefly
grieved the King was the ordinance for the removal of
evil coun&s;ellors, by which a great number of per&s;on
were by name excluded from every office of power and
profit; and Piers Gava&s;ton him&s;elf was for ever bani&s;hed
the King's dominions, under the penalty, in ca&s;e of
di&s;obedience, of being declared a public enemy. Other
per&s;ons, more agreeable to the barons, were &s;ub&s;tituted
in all the offices. And it was ordained, that, for the
future, all the con&s;iderable dignities in the hou&s;hold, as
well as in the law, revenue, and military governments,
&s;hould be appointed by the <HI>baronage</HI> in parliament; and
the power of making war, or a&s;&s;embling his military te|nants,
&s;hould no longer be &s;olely ve&s;ted in the King, nor
be exerci&s;ed without the con&s;ent of the nobility.</P>
<P>EDWARD, from the &s;ame weakne&s;s both of his tem|per
and &s;ituation, which had engaged him to grant
this unlimited cornmi&s;&s;ion to the barons, was led to give
a parliamentary &s;anction to their ordinances: But as a
con&s;equence of the &s;ame character, he <HI>&s;ecretly</HI> made a
prote&s;t against them, and declared, that, &s;ince the com|mi&s;&s;ion
was granted only for the making of ordinances to
the advantage of the King and kingdom, such articles as
<PB N="345" REF="372">
&s;hould be found prejudicial to both, were to be held as
not ratified and confirmed<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Ryley's Placit. Parl. p. 530, 541.</NOTE>. It is no wonder, indeed,
that he retained a firm purpo&s;e to revoke ordinances,
which had been impo&s;ed on him by violence, which en|tirely
annihilated the royal authority, and above all,
which deprived him of the company and &s;ociety of a per|&s;on,
whom, by an unu&s;ual infatuation, he valued above
all the world, and above every other con&s;ideration of
intere&s;t or tranquillity.</P>
<P>So &s;oon, therefore, as Edward, removing to York,
had freed him&s;elf from the immediate terror of the barons
power, he invited back Gava&s;ton from Flanders, which
that favourite had made the place of his retreat; and de|claring
his bani&s;hment to be illegal, and contrary to the
laws and cu&s;toms of the kingdom<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Brady's App. N^o. 53. Wal&s;ing. p. 98.</NOTE>, openly re-instated
him in his former credit and authority. The barons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1312.</NOTE>
highly provoked at this di&s;appointment, and apprehen|&s;ive
of danger to them&s;elves from the declared animo&s;ity
of &s;o powerful a minion, &s;aw, that either his or their
ruin was now inevitable; and they renewed with redoubled
zeal their former confederacies again&s;t him. The earl
of Lanca&s;ter was a dangerous head of this alliance:
Guy, earl of Warwic, entered into it with a furious
and precipitate pa&s;&s;ion: Humphrey Bohun, earl of Here|ford,
the con&s;table, and Aymer de Valence, earl of
Pembroke, brought to it a great acce&s;&s;ion of power and
intere&s;t: Even earl Warrenne de&s;erted the royal cau&s;e,
which be had hitherto &s;upported, and was induced to
embrace the &s;ide of the con&s;ederates<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Trivet, cont. p. 4.</NOTE>: And as Robert

the King and his minion. So predominant, at that
time, was the power of the great nobility, that the com|bination
of a few of them was always able to &s;hake
the throne; and &s;uch an univer&s;al concurrence became irre|&s;i&s;tible.
The earl of Lanca&s;ter &s;uddenly rai&s;ed an army,
and marched to York, where he found the King already
removed to Newca&s;tle<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing. p. 101.</NOTE>: He flew thither in pur&s;uit of him; and Edward had ju&s;t time to e&s;cape to Tinmouth,
where he embarked, and &s;ailed with Gava&s;ton to Scar|borough.
He left his favourite in that fortre&s;s, which,
had it been properly &s;upplied with provi&s;ions, was
deemed impregnable; and he marched forward to York,
in hopes of rai&s;ing an army, which might be able to
&s;upport him again&s;t his enemies. Pembroke was &s;ent
by the confederates to be&s;iege the ca&s;tle of Scarborough;
and Gava&s;ton, &s;en&s;ible of the bad condition of his gar|ri&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">19th May.</NOTE>
was obliged to capitulate with the enemy, and
&s;urrender him&s;elf pri&s;oner<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing. p. 101.</NOTE>. He &s;tipulated, that he
should remain in Pembroke's hands for two months;
that endeavours &s;hould, during that time, be mutually
u&s;ed for a general accommodation; that if the terms
propo&s;ed by the barons were not accepted, the ca&s;tle
&s;hould be re&s;tored to him in the &s;ame condition as when
he &s;urrendered it; and that the earl of Pembroke and
Henry Piercy &s;hould, by contract, pledge all their lands
for the fulfilling of the&s;e conditions<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 324.</NOTE>. Pembroke, now
ma&s;ter of the per&s;on of this public enemy, conducted
him to the ca&s;tle of Dedington, near Banbury; where,
on pretence of other bu&s;ine&s;s, he left him protected by a
feeble guard<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">T. de la More, p. 593.</NOTE>. Warwic, probably in concert with
Pembroke, attacked the ca&s;tle: The guards refu&s;ed to
make any re&s;i&s;tance: Gava&s;ton was yielded up to him,

executioner<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing. p. 101. T. de la More, p. 593. Trivet, cont. p. 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King had retired northward to Berwic, when he
heard of Gava&s;ton's murder; and his re&s;entment was
proportioned to the affection which he had ever borne
him, while living. He threatened vengeance on all the
nobility, who had been active in that bloody &s;cene, and
he made preparations for war in all parts of England.
But being le&s;s con&s;tant in his enmities than in his friend|&s;hips,
he &s;oon after hearkened to terms of accommoda|tion;
granted the barons a pardon for all offences; and
as they &s;tipulated to a&s;k him publickly pardon on their
knees<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ryley, p. 538. Rymer, vol. iii. p. 366.</NOTE>, he was &s;o plea&s;ed with the&s;e vain appearances
of exterior &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, that he &s;eemed to have &s;incerely
forgiven them all pa&s;t injuries. But as they &s;till pre|tended,
notwith&s;tanding their lawle&s;s conduct, a great
anxiety for the maintenance of law; and required the
e&s;tabli&s;hment of their former ordinances as a nece&s;&s;ary
&s;ecurity for that purpo&s;e; Edward told them, that he
was willing to grant them a free and legal confirmation
of &s;uch of the&s;e ordinances as were not entirely deroga|tory
to the prerogatives of the crown. This an&s;wer was
received for the pre&s;ent as &s;atisfactory. The King's per|&s;on,
after the death of Gava&s;ton, was now become le&s;s
obnoxious to the public; and as the ordinances, in&s;i&s;ted
on, appeared to be nearly the &s;ame with tho&s;e, which had
been formerly extorted from Henry III. by Mountfort,
and which had been attended with &s;o many fatal confe|quences,
they were, on that account, demanded with
<PB N="348" REF="377">
le&s;s vehemence by the nobility and people. The minds
of all men &s;eemed to be much appea&s;ed towards each
other: The animo&s;ities of faction no longer prevailed:
And England, now united under its head, would hence|forth
be able, it was hoped, to take vengeance on all its
enemies; particularly on the Scots, who&s;e progre&s;s was
the object of general re&s;entment and indignation.</P>
<P>IMMEDIATELY after Edward's retreat from Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with Scotland.</NOTE>
Robert Bruce left his fa&s;tne&s;&s;es, in which he intended to
have &s;heltered his feeble force; and &s;upplying his defect
of power by &s;uperior vigour and abilities, he made deep
impre&s;&s;ions on all his enemies, foreign and dome&s;tic.
He cha&s;ed the lord Argyle and the chieftain of the Mac|dowals
from their hills, and made him&s;elf entirely ma&s;ter
of the high country: He thence invaded with &s;ucce&s;s the
Cummins in the low countries of the north: He took
the ca&s;tles of Inverne&s;s, Forfar, and Brechin: He gained
daily &s;ome new acce&s;&s;ion of territory; and what was a
more important acqui&s;ition, he daily reconciled the minds
of the nobility to his dominion, and enli&s;ted under his
&s;tandard every bold leader, whom he enriched by the
&s;poils of his enemies. Sir James Douglas, in whom
commenced the greatne&s;s and renown of that warlike
family, &s;econded him in all his enterprizes: Edward
Bruce, Robert's own brother, di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by
actions of valour: And the terror of the Engli&s;h power
being now abated by the feeble conduct of the King,
even the lea&s;t &s;anguine of the Scots began to entertain
hopes of recovering their independancy; and the whole
kingdom, except a few &s;trong fortre&s;&s;es, which he had
not the means to attack, had acknowledged the autho|rity
of Robert.</P>
<P>IN this &s;ituation, Edward had found it nece&s;&s;ary to
grant a truce to Scotland; and Robert &s;ucce&s;sfully em|ployed
this interval in con&s;olidating his power, and in|troducing
<PB N="349" REF="378">
order into the civil government, disjointed by
&s;uch a long continuance of war and facions. The in|terval
was very &s;hort: The truce, ill ob&s;erved on both
&s;ides, was at la&s;t openly violated; and war recommenced
with greater fury than ever. Robert, not contented
with defending him&s;elf, had made &s;ucce&s;sful inroads into
England, &s;ub&s;i&s;ted his needy followers by the plunder of
that country, and taught them to de&s;pi&s;e the military
genius of a nation, who had long been the object of
their terror. Edward at la&s;t, rouzed from his lethargy,
had conducted an army into Scotland; and Robert, de|termined
not to ri&s;que too much again&s;t an enemy &s;o
much &s;uperior, retired again into his mountains. The
King advanced beyond Edinburgh; but being de&s;titute
of provi&s;ions, and being ill &s;upported by the Engli&s;h
nobility, who were then employed in framing their ordi|nances,
he was &s;oon obliged to return home, without
gaining any advantage over the enemy. But the ap|pearing
union of all the parties in England, after the
death of Gava&s;ton, &s;eemed to re&s;tore that kingdom to its
native force, opened again the pro&s;pect of &s;ubjecting
Scotland, and promi&s;ed a happy conclu&s;ion to a war, in
which both the intere&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions of the nation were
&s;o deeply concerned.</P>
<P>EDWARD a&s;&s;embled forces from all quarters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1314.</NOTE> with a
view of fini&s;hing by one blow this important enterprize.
He &s;ummoned the mo&s;t warlike of his va&s;&s;als from Ga&s;|cony:
He inli&s;ted troops from Flanders and other foreign
countries: He invited over great numbers of the di&s;orderly
Irivh as to a certain prey: He joined to them a body of
the Wel&s;h, who were actuated by like motives: And
a&s;&s;embling the whole military force of England, he
marched to the frontiers with an army, which, according
to the Scots writers, amounted to an hundred thou&s;and
<PB N="350" REF="379">
men, but which was probably much inferior to that
number<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">We find in Rymer, vol. iii. p. 481. a li&s;t of all the infantry a&s;&s;em|bled from all parts of England and Wales; and they are only 21540. It is not likely therefore that the whole army could be near &s;o numerous at is reported.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE army collected by Robert, exceeded not thirty
thou&s;and combatants; but being compo&s;ed of men, who
had di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by many acts of valour,
who were rendered de&s;perate by their &s;ituation, and who
were enured to all the varieties of fortune, they might
ju&s;tly, under &s;uch a leader, be deemed formidable to the
mo&s;t numerous and be&s;t appointed armies. The ca&s;tle
of Stirling, which, with Berwic, was the only fortre&s;s
of Scotland, that remained in the hands of the Engli&s;h,
had been long be&s;ieged by Edward Bruce; and Philip de
Mowbray, the governor, after an ob&s;tinate defence,
was at la&s;t obliged to capitulate, and to promi&s;e that if,
before a certain day, which was now approaching, he
was not relieved, he &s;hould open his gates to the ene|my<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iii. p. 481.</NOTE>.
Robert therefore, &s;en&s;ible that here was the
ground on which he mu&s;t expect the Engli&s;h, cho&s;e the
field of battle with all the &s;kill and prudence imaginable,
and made the nece&s;&s;ary preparations for their reception,
He po&s;ted him&s;elf at Bannockburn, about two miles
from Stirling; where he had a hill on his right flank,
and a mora&s;s on his left: And not content with having
taken the&s;e precautions to prevent his being &s;urrounded
by the more numerous army of the Engli&s;h; he fore&s;aw
the &s;uperior &s;trength of the enemy in cavalry, and made
provi&s;ions again&s;t it. Having a rivulet in front, he
commanded deep pits to be dug along its banks, and
&s;harp &s;lakes to be planted in them, and he ordered the
whole to be carefully covered over with turf<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">T. de la More, p. 594.</NOTE>. The
Engli&s;h arrived in &s;ight on the evening, and a bloody
<PB N="351" REF="380">
conflict immediately en&s;ued between two bodies of ca|valry;
where Robert, who was at the head of the Scots,
engaged in &s;ingle combat with Henry de Bohun, a gen|tleman
of the family of Hereford; and at one &s;troke
cleft his adver&s;ary to the chin with a battle ax, in &s;ight
of the two armies. The Engli&s;h hor&s;e fled with preci|pitation
to their main body.</P>
<P>THE Scots, encouraged by this favourable event, and
glorying in the valour of their prince, progno&s;ticated a
happy i&s;&s;ue to the combat on the en&s;uing day: The
Engli&s;h, confident in their numbers, and elated with
pa&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;es, longed for an opportunity of revenge:
And the night,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Bannock|burn.</NOTE> tho' extremely &s;hort in that &s;ea&s;on and
in that climate, appeared tedious to the impatience of
the &s;everal combatants.<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th June.</NOTE> Early in the morning, Edward
drew out his army, and advanced towards the Scots.
The earl of Gloce&s;ter, his nephew, who commanded the
left wing of the cavalry, impelled by the ardour of youth,
ru&s;hed on to the attack without precaution, and fell
among the covered pits, which had been prepared by
Bruce for the reception of the enemy<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">T. de la More, p. 594.</NOTE>. This body of
hor&s;e was di&s;ordered: Gloce&s;ter him&s;elf was overthrown
and &s;lain: Sir James Douglas, who commanded the
Scotti&s;h cavalry, gave the enemy no lei&s;ure to rally, but
pu&s;hed them off the field with con&s;iderable lo&s;s, and pur|&s;ued
them in &s;ight of their whole line of infantry.
While the Engli&s;h army were alarmed with this unfor|tunate
beginning of the action, which commonly proves
deci&s;ive, they ob&s;erved an army on the heights towards
their left, which &s;eemed to be marching lei&s;urely in or|der
to &s;urround them; and they were di&s;tracted by
their multiplied fears. This was a number of waggon|ers
and &s;umpter boys, whom Robert had collected toge|ther;
and having &s;upplied them with military &s;tandards,
<PB N="352" REF="381">
gave them the appearance at a di&s;tance of a formidable
army. The &s;tratagem took effect: A panic feized the
Engli&s;h: They threw down their arms and fled: They
were pur&s;ued with great &s;laughter, for the &s;pace of eighty
miles, till they reached Berwic: And the Scots, be&s;ides
an ine&s;timable booty, toot many per&s;ons of quality pri&s;on|ers,
and above 400 gentlemen, whom Robert treated with great humanity<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ypod. Neu&s;t. p. 501.</NOTE>, and who&s;e ran&s;om was a new
acce&s;&s;ion of wealth to the victorious army. The King
himfelf very narrowly e&s;caped by taking &s;helter in Dun|bar,
who&s;e gates were opened to him by the earl of
March; and he thence pa&s;&s;ed by fea to Berwic.</P>
<P>SUCH was the great and deci&s;ive battle of Bannock|burn,
which &s;ecured the independancy of Scotland, fixed
Bruce on the throne of that kingdom, and may be
deemed the greate&s;t overthrow, which the Engli&s;h mo|narchy,
&s;ince the conque&s;t, has ever received. The
numbers of &s;lain on the&s;e occa&s;ions are always uncertain,
and are commonly much magnified by the victors: But
this defeat made a deep impre&s;&s;ion on the minds of the
Engli&s;h; and it was remarked, that, for &s;ome years, no
&s;uperiority of numbers could encourage them to keep
the field again&s;t the Scots<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing. p. 106.</NOTE>. Robert, to make advan|tage
of his pre&s;ent &s;ucce&s;s, broke into England, and
ravaged all the northern counties without oppo&s;ition:
He befieged Carlifle, tho' that place was &s;aved by the
valour of Sir Andrew Harcla, the governor: He was
more &s;uccefsful again&s;t Berwic, which he took by a&s;|&s;ault<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">T. de la More, p. 594. Murimuth, p. 53.</NOTE>:

fly to the &s;tandard of the Scots, whom they regarded as
their deliverers: But a grievous famine, which at that
time laid de&s;olate both Ireland and Britain, reduced the
Scotti&s;h army to the greate&s;t extremities; and Robert
was obliged to return, with his forces much dimini&s;hed,
into his own country. His brother, after having expe|rienced
a variety of fortune, was defeated and &s;lain near
Dundalk by the Engli&s;h, commanded by lord Berming|ham<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iii. p. 767, 777. Wal&s;ing. p. 3. Y pod. Neu&s;t. p. 503. T. de la More, p. 594. Trivet, cont. p. 29.</NOTE>:

<P>THE King, be&s;ides &s;uffering tho&s;e di&s;a&s;ters from the

was al&s;o infe&s;ted with a rebellion in Wales<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iii. p. 553</NOTE>; and above
all by the factions of his own nobility, who took advan|tage
of the public calamities, in&s;ulted his fallen fortunes,
and endeavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h their own independance on
the ruins of the throne. Lanca&s;ter and the barons of his
party, who had declined attending Edward on his Scot|ti&s;h
expedition, no &s;ooner &s;aw him return with di&s;grace,
than they in&s;i&s;ted on the renewal of their ordinances,
which they &s;till pretended to have validity; and the
King's unhappy condition obliged him to &s;ubmit to their
demands. The mini&s;try was new modeled by the di|rection
of Lanca&s;ter<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ryley, p. 560. Rymer, vol. iii. p. 722.</NOTE>: That nobleman was placed at

And the nation, under this new model of government,
endeavoured to put it&s;elf in a better po&s;ture of
defence again&s;t the Scots. But the factious nobles were
far from being terrified with the progre&s;s of the&s;e public
enemies: On the contrary, they founded the hopes of
their own future grandeur on the weakne&s;s and diftre&s;&s;es
of the crown: Lancafter himfelf was &s;u&s;pected, with
great appearance of rea&s;on, of holding a &s;ecret corre&s;|pondence
with the King of Scots: And tho' he was him|felf
entru&s;ted with the command of the Engli&s;h armies,
he took care that every enterprise &s;hould be di&s;appointed,
and every plan of operations prove un&s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>ALL the European kingdoms, e&s;pecially that of Eng|land,
were at this time totally unacquainted with the
office of a prime mini&s;ter, &s;o well under&s;tood at pre&s;ent
in all regular monarchies; and the people could form no
conception of a man, who, tho' &s;till in the rank of a
&s;ubject, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the power of a &s;overeign, ea&s;ed the
prince of the burthen of affairs, &s;upplied his want of
experience or capacity, and maintained all the rights of the crown,
without degrading the great|e&s;t nobles by
their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his temporary authority. Edward
was plainly by nature unfit to hold himfelf the reins of go|vernment:
He had no vices; but was unhappy in a total
incapacity for &s;erious bu&s;ine&s;s: He was &s;en&s;ible of his
own defects, and nece&s;&s;arily &s;ought to be governed: Yet
every favourite, whom he &s;ucce&s;&s;ively cho&s;e, was re|garded
as a fellow-&s;ubject, exalted above his rank and
&s;tation: He was the object of envy to the great nobility:
His character and conduct were decryed with the peo|ple:
His authority over the king and kingdom was con|&s;idered
as an u&s;urpation: And unle&s;s the prince had em|braced
the dangerous expedient, of devolving his power
<PB N="355" REF="384">
on the earl of Lanca&s;ter or &s;ome mighty baron, who&s;e
family intere&s;t was &s;o exten&s;ive as to be able alone to
maintain his influence, he could expect no peace nor
tranquillity upon the throne.</P>
<P>THE King's chief favourite,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hugh le De&s;pen&s;er.</NOTE> after the death of Ga|va&s;ton,
was Hugh le De&s;pen&s;er or Spen&s;er, a young man
of Engli&s;h birth, of high rank, and of a noble family<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Dugd. Baron. vol. i. p. 389.</NOTE>.
He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the exterior accompli&s;hments of per&s;on
and addre&s;s, which were fitted to engage the weak mind
of Edward; but was devoid of that moderation and
prudence, which might have qualified him to mitigate
the' envy of the great, and conduct him thro' all the
perils of that dangerous &s;tation, to which he was ad|vanced.
His father, who was of the &s;ame name, and
who, by means of his &s;on, had al&s;o attained great influ|ence
over the King, was a nobleman venerable from his
years, re&s;pected thro' all his pa&s;t life for wi&s;dom, valour,
and integrity, and well fitted by his talents and experi|ence,
could affairs have admitted of any temperament,
to have &s;upplied the defects both of the King and of
his minion<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">T. de la More, p. 594.</NOTE>. But no &s;ooner was Edward's attachment
declared for young Spen&s;er, than the turbulent Lanca&s;ter,
and mo&s;t of the great barons, regarded him their rival,
made him the object of their animo&s;ity, and formed vio|lent
plans for his ruin<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing. p. 113. T. de la More, p. 595. Murimuth, p. 55.</NOTE>. They fir&s;t declared their dif|content
by withdrawing from parliament; and it was
not long ere they found a pretence for proceeding to
greater extremities again&s;t him.</P>
<P>THE King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1321.</NOTE> who &s;et no limits to his bounty towards
his minions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Civil com|motions.</NOTE> had married the younger Spen&s;er to his
niece, one of the co-heirs of the earl of Gloce&s;ter, &s;lain
at Bannockburn; and the favourite, by his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
<PB N="356" REF="385">
to that opulent family, had inherited great po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in
the marches of Wales<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Trivet, cont. p. 25.</NOTE>, and being de&s;irous of extending
&s;till farther his influence in tho&s;e quarters, he is accu&s;ed
of having committed inju&s;tice towards the barons of
Audley and d'Ammori, who had al&s;o married two &s;i&s;ters
of the &s;ame family. There was likewife a baron in
that neighbourhood, called William de Braou&s;e, lord of
Gower, who had made a &s;ettlement of his e&s;tate on John
de Mowbray, his &s;on-in-law; and in ca&s;e of failure of
that nobleman and his i&s;&s;ue, had &s;ub&s;tituted the earl of
Hereford, in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the barony of Gower.
Mowbray, on the decea&s;e of his father-in-law, entered
immediately into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the e&s;tate, without the
formality of taking livery and feizin from the crown;
and Spen&s;er, who coveted that barony, per&s;uaded the
King to put in execution the rigour of the feudal law, to
&s;eize Gower as e&s;cheated to the crown, and to confer it
upon him<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Monach, Malmes.</NOTE>. This tran&s;action, which was the proper
&s;ubject of a law-fuit, immediately excited a civil war in
the kingdom. The earls of Lanca&s;ter and Hereford
flew to arms: Audley and d'Ammori joined them with
all their forces: The two Rogers de Mortimer and Roger
de Clifford, with many others, di&s;gu&s;ted for private rea|&s;ons
with the Spen&s;ers, brought a con&s;iderable acce&s;&s;ion
to the party: And their army being now formidable,
they &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the King, requiring him immedi|ately
to diimifs or confine the younger Spen&s;er; and me|nacing
him, in ca&s;e of refu&s;al, with renouncing their
homage and allegiance to him, and taking revenge on
that mini&s;ter by their own authority. They &s;carce
waited for an an&s;wer; but immediately fell upon the
lands of young Spencer, which they pillaged and de&s;troy|ed;
murdered his &s;ervants, drove off his cattle, and
<PB N="357" REF="386">
burned his hou&s;es<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Murimuth, p. 55.</NOTE>. They proceeded thence to commit
like deva&s;tations on the e&s;tates of Spen&s;er, the father,
who&s;e character hitherto they had &s;eemed to re&s;pect.
And having drawn and &s;igned a formal a&s;&s;ociation among
them&s;elves<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Tyrrel, vol. ii. p. 280, from the regi&s;ter of C. C. Canterbury.</NOTE>, they marched up to London with all their
forces, &s;tationed them&s;elves in the neighbourhood of that
city, and demanded of the King the bani&s;hment of both
the Spen&s;ers. The&s;e noblemen were then ab&s;ent; the
father abroad; the &s;on at &s;ea; and both of them em|ployed
in different commi&s;&s;ions: The King therefore
replied, that his coronation oath, by which he was bound
to ob&s;erve the laws, re&s;trained him from giving his a&s;&s;ent
to &s;o illegal a demand, or condemning noblemen who
were accu&s;ed of no crime, nor had any opportunity af|forded
them of making an&s;wer<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing. p. 114.</NOTE>. Equity and rea&s;on
were but a feeble oppo&s;ition to men, who had arms in
their hands, and who, being already involved in guilt,
&s;aw no &s;afety but in &s;ucce&s;s and victory. They entered
London with their troops; and giving in to the parlia|ment,
which was then &s;itting, a charge again&s;t the
Spen&s;ers, of which they attempted not to prove one
article, they procured, by menaces and violence, a &s;en|tence
of perpetual exile and forfeiture again&s;t the&s;e mini&s;|ters<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Tottle's collect. part 2. p. 50. Wal&s;ing. p. 114.</NOTE>.
This &s;entence was voted by the lay barons alone:
For the commons, tho' now an e&s;tate in parliament,
were yet of &s;o little con&s;ideration, that their a&s;&s;ent was
never demanded; and even the voice of the prelates
was neglected amid&s;t the pre&s;ent di&s;orders. The only
&s;ymptom, which the&s;e turbulent barons gave of their re|gard
to law, was their requiring from the King an in|demnity
for their illegal proceedings<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Tottle's collect, part 2. p. 54. Rymer, vol. iii. p. 891.</NOTE>; after which they
<PB N="358" REF="387">
di&s;banded their army, and &s;eparated, in &s;ecurity, as they
imagined, to their &s;everal ca&s;tles.</P>
<P>THIS act of violence, in which the King was obliged
to acquie&s;ce, rendered his per&s;on and his authority &s;o
contemptible, that every one thought him&s;elf entitled to
treat him with neglect. The queen, having occa&s;ion
&s;oon after to pa&s;s by the ca&s;tle of Leeds in Kent, which
belonged to the lord Badle&s;mere, de&s;ired a night's lodging;
but was re&s;u&s;ed admittance, and &s;ome of her attendants,
who pre&s;ented them&s;elves at the gate, were killed<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iii. p. 89. Wal&s;ing. p. 114, 115. T. de la More, p. 595. Murimuth, p. 56.</NOTE>.
The in&s;ult and brutality towards this prince&s;s, who had
always endeavoured to live on good terms with the ba|rons,
and who joined them heartily in their hatred of the
I younger Spen&s;er, was an action which no body pre|tended
to vindicate; and the King thought, that he
might, without giving general umbrage, a&s;&s;emble an
army, and take vengeance on the offender. No one
came to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Badle&s;mere; and Edward pre|vailed<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing. p. 115.</NOTE>:
But having now &s;ome forces on foot, and
having concerted rnea&s;ures with his friends throughout
England, he ventured to take off the ma&s;k, to attack all
his enemies, and to recall the two Spen&s;ers, who&s;e &s;en|tence
he declared illegal, unju&s;t, contrary to the tenor
of the great charter, pa&s;&s;ed without the a&s;&s;ent of the
prelates, and extorted by violence from him and the
e&s;tate of barons<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iii. p. 907. T. de la More, p. 595.</NOTE>.
Still the commons were not men|tioned
by either party.</P>
<P>THE King had now got the &s;tart of his adver&s;aries;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1322.</NOTE>
an advantage, which, in tho&s;e times, was commonly
deci&s;ive: And ha&s;tened with his army to the marches
of Wales, the chief &s;eat of the enemies power, whom he
found totally unprepared for re&s;i&s;tance. Many of the
<PB N="359" REF="388">

&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing. p. 115. Murimuth, p. 57.</NOTE>:
Their ca&s;tles were &s;eized, and their per|&s;ons
committed to cu&s;tody. But Lanca&s;ter, in order to
prevent the total ruin of his party, &s;ummoned together
all his va&s;&s;als and retainers; declared his alliance with
Scotland, which had long been &s;u&s;pected; received the
promi&s;e of a reinforcement from that country under the
command of Randolf, earl of Murray, and Sir James
Douglas<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iii. p. 958.</NOTE>; and being joined by the earl of Hereford,
advanced with all his forces again&s;t the King, who had
collected an army of 30,000 men, and was &s;uperior to
his enemies. Lanca&s;ter po&s;ted him&s;elf at Burton upon
Trent, and endeavoured to defend the pa&s;&s;ages of the
river<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing. p. 115.</NOTE>: But being di&s;appointed in that plan of opera|tions;
this nobleman, who had no military genius, and
who&s;e per&s;onal courage was even &s;u&s;pected, fled with his
army to the north, in expectation of being there joined
by his Scotti&s;h allies<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Ypod. Neu&s;t. p. 504.</NOTE>. He was pur&s;ued by the King;
and his army dimini&s;hed daily; till he came to Borough-bridge,
where he found Sir Andrew Harcla po&s;ted with
&s;ome forces on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river, and ready
to di&s;pute the pa&s;&s;age with him. He was repul&s;ed in an
attempt which he made to force his way; the earl of
Hereford was killed;<NOTE PLACE="marg">16 March.</NOTE> the whole army of the rebels was
di&s;concerted; Lanca&s;ter him&s;elf was become incapable
of taking any mea&s;ures either for flight or defence; and
he was &s;eized without re&s;i&s;tance by Harcla, and con|ducted
to the King<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">T. de la More, p. 596. Wal&s;ing. p. 116.</NOTE>. In tho&s;e violent times, the laws

open rebellion, and was taken in arms again&s;t his

all the attacks of England: He had &s;ucce&s;s&s;ully carried
war both into that kingdom and into Ireland: He had
rejected with di&s;dain the Pope's authority, who pretended
to impo&s;e his commands upon him, and oblige him to
make peace with his enemies: His throne was firmly e&s;ta|bli&s;hed,

<P>PHILIP the Fair,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1324.</NOTE> King of France, who died in 1315,

there was no common nor equitable judge in that &s;trange

&s;eemed de&s;irous to take advantage of Edward's weakne&s;s,

After an ernba&s;&s;y by the earl of Kent, the

many difficulties in complying with this demand.
Young Spen&s;er, by whom the King was implicitly govern|ed,

to in&s;ults, if not to danger. He he&s;itated no le&s;s on
allowing the King to make the journey alone; both

&s;o happily to remove all difficulties, was im|mediately

<P>THE Queen, on her arrival in France, had found
there a great number of Engli&s;h fugitives, the remains
of the Lanca&s;trian faction; and their common hatred of
Spen&s;er, &s;oon bred a &s;ecret friend&s;hip and corre&s;pondence
between them and that prince&s;s. Among the re&s;t was
young Roger Mortimer, a potent baron in the Wel&s;h
marches, who had been obliged, with others, to make
his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the King, had been condemned for high
trea&s;on; but having received a pardon for his life, was
afterwards detained in the Tower, with an intention of

<PB N="364" REF="393">
his court to Queen I&s;abella. The graces of his per&s;on
and addre&s;s advanced him quickly in her affections: He
became her confident and coun&s;ellor in all her mea&s;ures:
And gaining daily ground upon her heart, he engaged
her to &s;acrifice at laft, to her pa&s;&s;ion, all the &s;entiments
of honour and of fidelity to her hu&s;band<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">T. de la More, p. 598. Murimuth, p. 65.</NOTE>. Hating
now the man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;piracy again&s;t the King.</NOTE> whom &s;he had injured, and whom &s;he
never valued, &s;he entered cordially into all Mortimer's
con&s;piracies; and having artfully got into her hands the
young prince, and heir of the monarchy, &s;he re&s;olved
on the utter ruin of the King, as well as of his favourite.
She engaged her brother to enter into this criminal
purpo&s;e: Her court was daily full of the exiled barons:
Mortimer lived in the mo&s;t declared intimacy with her:
A corre&s;pondence was &s;ecretly carried on with the male
content party in England: And when Edward, informe$
of the&s;e alarming circum&s;tances, required her &s;peedily to
return with the prince, &s;he publicly replied, that &s;he never
would &s;et foot in the kingdom, till Spen&s;er was forever
removed from his pre&s;ence and councils: A declaration,
which procured her great popularity in England, and
threw a decent veil on all her trea&s;onable enterprizes.</P>
<P>EDWARD endeavoured to put him&s;elf in a po&s;ture of
defence<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iv. p. 184. 188. 225.</NOTE>; but be&s;ides the difficulties ari&s;ing from his
own indolence and &s;lender abilities, and the want of
authority, which of con&s;equence attended all his re&s;o|lutions,
it was not ea&s;y for him, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of
the kingdom and revenue, to maintain a con&s;tant force,
ready to repell an inva&s;ion, which he knew not at what
time or place he had rea&s;on to expect. All his efforts
were unequal to the traiterous and ho&s;tile con&s;piraces,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In&s;urrec|ons.</NOTE>
which both at home and abroad were forming again&s;t
<PB N="365" REF="394">
his authority, and which were daily penetrating farther
even into his own family. His brother, the earl of
Kent, a virtuous but weak prince, who was then at
Paris, was unwarily engaged by his &s;i&s;ter-in-law, and by
the King of France, who was al&s;o his cou&s;in german,
to give countenance to the inva&s;ion, who&s;e &s;ole object,
he believed, was the expul&s;ion of the Spen&s;ers: He pre|vailed
on his elder brother the earl of Norfolk, to enter
&s;ecretly into the &s;ame de&s;ign: The brother and heir of
the earl of Lanca&s;ter had too many rea&s;ons for his
hatred of the&s;e mini&s;ters, to refu&s;e his concurrence.
Walter de Reynel, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, and many
of the prelates expre&s;&s;ed their approbation of the Queen's
mea&s;ures: Several of the mo&s;t potent barons, envying
the exorbitant authority of the favourite, were ready to
$word$ to arms: The minds of the people, by means of
&s;ome truths and many calumnies, were &s;trongly di&s;po&s;ed
to the &s;ame party: And there needed but the appearance
of the Queen and Prince, with &s;uch a body of foreign
troops, as might be &s;ufficient to give her protection

<P>CHARLES,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1326.</NOTE> tho' he gave countenance and a&s;&s;i&s;tance

and I&s;abella was obliged to court the alliance of &s;ome
other foreign potentate, from who&s;e dominions &s;he might
&s;et out on her intended enterprize. For this purpo&s;e,
&s;he affianced young Edward, who&s;e tender age made him

the coa&s;t of Suffolk. The earl of Kent was in her
company: Two other princes of the blood, the earl of
Norfolk, and the brother of the earl of Lanca&s;ter,
joined her &s;oon after her landing with all their follow|ers:
Three prelates, the bi&s;hops of Ely, Lincoln, and

the authority of their character<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing. p. 123. Ypod. Neu&s;t. p. 507. T. de la More, p. 598. Murimuth, p. 66.</NOTE>: Even Robert de Wat|teville,
who had been &s;ent by the King to oppo&s;e her
progre&s;s in Suffolk, de&s;erted to her with all his forces.
To render her cau&s;e more favourable, &s;he renewed her
declaration, that the &s;ole purpo&s;e of her enterprise was
to free the king and kingdom from the tyranny of the
Spen&s;ers, and of chancellor Baldoc, their creature<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ypod. Neu&s;t. p. 508.</NOTE>. The
populace were allured by her &s;pecious pretences: The
barons thought them&s;elves &s;ecure again&s;t forfeitures by
the appearance of the prince of Wales in her army:
And a weak irre&s;olute King, &s;upported by mini&s;ters ge|nerally
odious, was altogether unable to &s;tem this torrent,
which bore with &s;uch irre&s;i&s;tible violence again&s;t him.</P>
<P>EDWARD, after trying in vain to rouze the citizens
of London to &s;ome &s;en&s;e of loyalty<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing. p. 123.</NOTE>, departed for the

and he had no &s;ooner di&s;covered his weakne&s;s by leaving
the city, than the rage of the populace broke out with|out
controul again&s;t him and his mini&s;ters. They fir&s;t
plundered and then murdered all tho&s;e who were ob|noxious
to them: They &s;eized the bi&s;hop of Exeter, a
virtuous and loyal prelate, as he was pa&s;&s;ing through
the &s;treets; and having beheaded him, they threw his
body into the river<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing. p. 124. T. de la Move, p. 599. Murimuth, p. 66.</NOTE>. They made them&s;elves ma&s;ters

of the Tower by &s;urprize; and then entered into a for|mal
a&s;&s;ociation to put to death, without mercy, every
one who &s;hould dare to oppo&s;e the enterprize of queen
I&s;abella, and of the prince<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing. p. 124.</NOTE>. A like &s;pirit was &s;oon
communicated to all other parts of England; and threw
the few &s;ervants of the King, who &s;till entertained
thoughts of performing their duty, into terror and a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>EDWARD was hotly pur&s;ued to Bri&s;tol by the earl of
Kent, &s;econded by the foreign forces under John de
Hainault. He found him&s;elf di&s;appointed in his expec|tations
with regard to the loyalty of tho&s;e parts; and
he pa&s;&s;ed over to Wales, where he flattered him&s;elf
his name was more popular, and which he hoped to

&s;eized the Engli&s;h<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Murimuth, p. 67.</NOTE>. The elder Spen&s;er, lately created
earl of Winche&s;ter, was left governor of the ca&s;tle of
Bri&s;tol; but the garri&s;on mutinied again&s;t him, and he
was delivered into the hands of his enemies. This
venerable noble, who had nearly reached the nine|tieth
year of his age, was in&s;tantly, without a trial,
or witne&s;s, or accu&s;ation, or an&s;wer, condemned to death
by the rebellious barons: He was hanged on a gibbet;
his body was cut in pieces, and thrown to the dogs<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Leland's Coll. vol. i. p. 673. T. de la More, p. 599. Wal&s;ing. $word$. 125. M. Froi&s;&s;art, liv. i. chap. 13.</NOTE>;

the earl of Lanca&s;ter, and was confined in the ca&s;tle of
Kenilworth. The younger Spen&s;er, his favourite, who
al&s;o fell into the hands of his enemies, was executed,
like his father, without any appearance of a legal trial<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing. p. 125. Ypod. Neu&s;t. p. 508.</NOTE>:
The earl of Arundel, almo&s;t the only man of his rank

without any trial, put to death at the in&s;tigation of
Mortimer: Baldoc, the chancellor, being a prie&s;t, could
not with &s;afety be &s;o &s;uddenly di&s;patched; but being
&s;ent to the bi&s;hop of Hereford's hou&s;e in London, he
was there, as his enemies probably fore&s;aw, &s;eized by

Even the u&s;ual reverence, paid the &s;acerdotal

to the pre&s;ent rage of the people.</P>
<P>THE queen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King dethroned.</NOTE> to avail her&s;elf of the prevailing delu|&s;ion,

barons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1327.</NOTE> who were concerned to &s;ecure their part trea|&s;ons
by committing new acts of violence again&s;t their

the populace, the mo&s;t dangerous of all in&s;truments,
and the lea&s;t an&s;werable for their exce&s;&s;es. A charge
was drawn up again&s;t the King, in which, even tho'
it was framed by his inveterate enemies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">13th Ja|nuary.</NOTE> nothing but
his narrow genius, or his misfortunes, were objected to
him: Fo$ the greate&s;t malice found no particular crime
with which it could reproach this unhappy prince.
He was accu&s;ed of incapacity for government, of wa&s;ting
his time in idle amu&s;ements, of neglecting public bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
of being &s;wayed by evil coun&s;ellors, of having
<PB N="369" REF="398">
lo&s;t, by his mi&s;conduct, the kingdom of Scotland, and
part of Guienne; and to &s;well the charge, even the
death of &s;ome barons, and the impri&s;onment of &s;ome
prelates, convicted of trea&s;on, were laid to his account<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Knyghton, p. 2765, 2766. Brady's App. N^o. 72.</NOTE>.
It was in vain, amid&s;t the violence of arms and tumult
of the people, to appeal either to law or rea&s;on: The
depo&s;ition of the King, without any appearing oppo|&s;ition,
was voted by parliament: The prince, already
declared regent by his party<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iv. p. 137. Wol&s;ing. p. 125.</NOTE>, was placed on the throne:
And a deputation was &s;ent to Edward at Kenilworth, to
require his re&s;ignation, which menaces and terror &s;oon
extorted from him.</P>
<P>BUT it was impo&s;&s;ible, that the people, however cor|rupted
by the barbarity of the times, &s;till farther en|flamed
by faction, could for ever remain in&s;en&s;ible to the
voice of nature. A wife, who had fir&s;t de&s;erted, next
invaded, and then dethroned her hu&s;band: Who had
made her infant &s;on an in&s;trument in this unnatural
treatment of his father: Who had by lying pretences &s;e|duced
the nation into a rebellion against their &s;overeign:
Who had pu&s;hed them into violences and cruelties, that
had di&s;honoured them: All tho&s;e circum&s;tances were &s;o
odious in them&s;elves, and formed &s;uch a complicated
&s;cene of guilt, that the lea&s;t reflection &s;ufficed to open
mens eyes, and make them dete&s;t this flagrant infringe|ment
of every public and private duty. The &s;u&s;picions
which &s;oon aro&s;e of I&s;abella's criminal commerce with
Mortimer, the proo&s;s which daily broke out of this part
of her guilt, encrea&s;ed the general abhorrence again&s;t
her; and her impudent hypocri&s;y, in publicly bewail|ing
with tears the King's unhappy fate<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Wol&s;ing. p. 126.</NOTE>, was not able
to deceive even the mo&s;t &s;tupid and mo&s;t prejudiced of
her adherents. In proportion as the Queen became the
<PB N="370" REF="399">
object of public hatred, the dethroned monarch, who
had been the victim of her crimes and her ambition,
was regarded with pity, with friend&s;hip, with veneration;
and men became &s;en&s;ible, that all his mi&s;conduct, which
faction had &s;o much exaggerated, had been owing to
the unavoidable eakne&s;s, not to any voluntary depra|vity
of his character. The new earl of Lanca&s;ter, to
who&s;e cu&s;tody he had been committed, was &s;oon touched
with the&s;e generous &s;entiments; and be&s;ides u&s;ing his
pri&s;oner with gentlene&s;s and humanity; he was &s;u&s;pected
to have entertained &s;till more honourable intentions in
his favour. The King, therefore, was taken out of his
hands, and delivered over to the lord Berkeley, and
Mautravers, and Gournay, who were entru&s;ted alter|nately,
each for a month, with the charge of guarding
him. While he was in Berkeley's cu&s;tody, he was &s;till
u&s;ed with the gentlene&s;s due to his rank and his mi&s;|fortunes;
but when Mautravers, and Gournay's turn
came, every &s;pecies of indignity was practi&s;ed again&s;t
him, as if their intention had been to break entirely the
prince's &s;pirit; and to employ his &s;orrows and afflict|tions,
in&s;tead of more violent and more dangerous expe|dients,
for the in&s;truments of his murder<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Anonymi Hi&s;t. p. 838.</NOTE>. It is re|ported,
that one day, when Edward was to be &s;haved,
they ordered cold and dirty water to be brought from
the ditch for that purpo&s;e; and when he de&s;ired it to be
changed, and was &s;till denied his reque&s;t, he bur&s;t out
into tears, which bedewed his cheeks; and he exclaimed,
that, in &s;pite of their in&s;olence, he &s;hould be &s;haved

Gournay was afterwards &s;eized at Mar&s;eilles, delivered over

He was obliged to devolve on others the weight of
government, which he had neither ability nor inclination
to bear: The &s;ame indolence and want of penetration
led him to make choice of mini&s;ters and favourites, who
were not always the be&s;t qualified for the tru&s;t committed
to them: The &s;editions grandees, plea&s;ed with his weak|ne&s;s,
yet complaining of it; under pretence of attacking
his mini&s;ters, in&s;ulted his per&s;on and invaded his autho|rity.
And the impatient populace, ignorant of the &s;ource
of their grievances, threw all the blame upon the King,
and encrea&s;ed the public di&s;orders by their faction and
violence. It was in vain to look for protection from the
laws, who&s;e voice, always feeble in tho&s;e times, was not
heard amide the din of arms: What could not defend
the King was le&s;s able to give &s;helter to any of the peo|ple:
The whole machine of government was torne in
pieces with fury and violence: And men, in&s;tead of
complaining again&s;t the manners of their age, and the
form of their con&s;titution, which required the mo&s;t &s;teady

errors to the per&s;on, who had the misfortune to be en|tru&s;ted
with the reins of empire.</P>
<P>BUT tho' &s;uch mi&s;takes be natural and unavoidable
while the events are recent, it is a &s;hameful delu&s;ion in
modern hi&s;torians, to imagine, that all the antient princes,
who were unfortunate in their government, were al&s;o
tyrannical in their conduct, and that the &s;editions of the
people proceeded always from &s;ome inva&s;ion of their
liberties and privileges by the monarch. Even a great
and a good King was not in that age &s;ecure again&s;t fac|tion
and rebellion, as appears $n the ca&s;e of Henry II.
but a great King had the be&s;t chance, as we learn from

they dreaded his valour and abilities, they were contented
with rea&s;onable &s;atisfaction, and pu&s;hed no farther their
advantages again&s;t him. The facility and weakne&s;s of
the &s;on, not his violence, threw every thing into confu|&s;ion:
The laws and government were overturned: An
attempt to rein&s;tate them was an unpardonable crime:
And no atonement, but the depo&s;ition and tragical death
of the King him&s;elf, could give the&s;e barons content|ment.
It is ea&s;y to &s;ee, that a con&s;titution, which de|pended
&s;o much on the per&s;onal character of the &s;ove|reign,

of will, not of laws. But always to throw,
without di&s;tinction, the blame of all di&s;orders upon the
prince, would introduce a fatal error in politics, and
&s;erve as a perpetual apology for trea&s;on and rebellion: As
if the turbulency of the great, and madne&s;s of the people,

of Europe, e&s;pecially in France. Their great riches,
joined to the cour&s;e of time, had, by degrees, relaxed
the &s;everity of the&s;e virtues; and the templars had in a
<PB N="374" REF="403">
great mea&s;ure lo&s;t that popularity, which fir&s;t rai&s;ed there to honour and di&s;tinction. Acquainted from experience
with the fatigues and dangers of tho&s;e fruitle&s;s expedi|tions
to the Ea&s;t, they cho&s;e rather to enjoy in ea&s;e their
opulent revenues in Europe: And being all of them men
of birth, educated, according to the cu&s;tom of that age,
without any tincture of letters, they &s;corned the ignoble
occupations of a mona&s;tic life, and pa&s;&s;ed their time
wholly in the fa&s;hionable amu&s;ements of hunting, gal|lantry,
and the plea&s;ures of the table. Their rival order,
that of St. John of Jeru&s;alem, who&s;e poverty had as yet
pre&s;erved them from like corruptions, &s;till di&s;tingui&s;hed
them&s;elves by their enterprizes again&s;t the infidels, and
&s;ucceeded to all the popularity, which was lo&s;t by the
indolence and luxury of the templars. But though the&s;e
cau&s;es had weakened the foundations of this order, once
&s;o celebrated and revered, the immediate &s;ource of their
de&s;truction proceeded from the cruel and vindictive &s;pirit
of Philip the Fair, who having entertained a private di&s;|gu&s;t
again&s;t &s;ome eminent templars, determined to gratify
at once his avidity and revenge, by involving the whole
order in one undi&s;tingui&s;hed ruin. On no better infor|mation,
than that of two knights, condemned by their
&s;uperiors to perpetual impri&s;onment for their vices and
profligacy; he ordered on, one day all the templars of
France to be committed to pri&s;on, and imputed to them
&s;uch enormous and ab&s;urd crimes, as are &s;ufficient of
them&s;elves to de&s;troy all the credit of the accu&s;ation.
Be&s;ides their being univer&s;ally charged with murder, rob|bery,
and vices the mo&s;t &s;hocking to nature; every one,
it was pretended, whom they received into their order,
was obliged to renounce our Saviour, to &s;pit upon the
cro&s;s<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iii. p. 31, 101.</NOTE>, and to join to this impiety the &s;uper&s;tition of
wor&s;hiping a gilded head, which was &s;ecretly kept in
<PB N="375" REF="404">
one of their hou&s;es at Mar&s;eilles. They al&s;o initiated,
it was &s;aid, every candidate by &s;uch infamous rites, as
could &s;erve to no other purpo&s;e, than to degrade the order
in his eyes, and de&s;troy for ever the authority of all his
&s;uperiors over him<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">It was pretended, that he ki&s;&s;ed the knights who received him on the mouth, navel and breech. Dupuy, p. 15, 16, Wal&s;. p. 99.</NOTE>. Above an hundred of the&s;e un|happy
gentlemen were put to the que&s;tion, in order to
extort from them a confe&s;&s;ion of their guilt: The more
ob&s;tinate peri&s;hed in the hands of their tormentors: Se|veral,
to procure them&s;elves immediate ea&s;e in the vio|lence
of their agonies, acknowledged whatever was re|quired
of them: Forged confe&s;&s;ions were imputed to
others<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Vertot, hi&s;t. de Chev. de Malte, vol. ii. p. 127, 130, &amp;c.</NOTE>: And Philip, as if their guilt were now certain,
proceeded to a confi&s;cation of all their trea&s;ures. But no
&s;ooner had the templars recovered from their tortures,
than, preferring the mo&s;t cruel execution to a life with
infamy, they di&s;avowed their confe&s;&s;ions, exclaimed
again&s;t the forgeries, ju&s;tified the innocence of their or|der,
and appealed to all the gallant actions, performed
by them in ancient or latter times, as a full apology for
their conduct. The barbarous tyrant, enraged at this
di&s;appointment, and thinking him&s;elf now engaged in
honour to proceed to extremities, ordered fifty-four
of them, whom he branded as relap&s;ed heretics, to peri&s;h
by the puni&s;hment of fire in his capital<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Vertot, vol. ii. p, 132. Trivet, Cont. p. 8.</NOTE>: Great numbers
expired after a like manner in other parts of the king|dom:
And when he found, that the per&s;everance of the&s;e
unhappy victims, in ju&s;tifying to the la&s;t their innocence,
had made deep impre&s;&s;ion on the &s;pectators, he, endea|vourgd
to overcome the con&s;tancy of the templars by new
inhumanities. The grand ma&s;ter of the order, John de
Molay, and another great officer, brother to the &s;ove|reign
of, Dauphin&eacute;, were conducted to a &s;caffold, erected
<PB N="376" REF="405">
before the church of Notredame, at Paris: A full pardon
was offered them on the one hand: The fire, de&s;tined
for their execution, was &s;hown to them on the other:
The&s;e gallant nobles &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in the prote&s;tations of
their own innocence and that of their order; and were
in&s;tantly hurried into the flames by the executioner<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Vertot, vol. ii. p. 142.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN all this barbarous inju&s;tice, Clement V. who was
the creature of Philip, and then re&s;ided in France, fully
concurred; and without examining a witne&s;s, or making
any enquiry into the truth of facts, he &s;ummarily, by
the plenitude of his apo&s;tolic power, aboli&s;hed the whole
order. The templars all over Europe were thrown into
pri&s;on; their conduct underwent a &s;trict &s;crutiny; the
power of their enemies &s;till pur&s;ued and oppre&s;&s;ed them;
but no where, except in France, were the &s;malle&s;t traces
of their guilt pretended to be found. England &s;ent back
an ample te&s;timony of their piety and morals; but as the
order was now annihilated, the knights were di&s;tributed
into &s;everal convents, and their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions were, by com|mand
of the Pope, transferred to the order of St. John<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iii p. 323, 956. vol. iv. p. 47. Ypod. Neu&s;t. p. 506.</NOTE>.
We now proceed to relate &s;ome other detached tran&s;ac|tions
of the pre&s;ent period.</P>
<P>THE kingdom of England was afflicted with a grievous
famine during &s;everal years of this reign. Perpetual
rains and cold weather, not only de&s;troyed the harve&s;t,
but bred a mortality among the cattle, and rai&s;ed every
kind of food to an enormous price<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Trivet, cont. p. 17,18.</NOTE>. The parliament,
in 1315, endeavoured to fix more moderate rates on com|modities;
not &s;en&s;ible that &s;uch an attempt was imprac|ticable,
and that, were it po&s;&s;ible to reduce the price of
food by any other expedient than introducing plenty,
nothing could be more pernicious and de&s;tructive to the
public. Where the produce of a year, for in&s;tance, falls
<PB N="377" REF="406">
&s;o far &s;hort, as to afford full &s;ub&s;i&s;tance only for nine
months, the only expedient for making it la&s;t all the
twelve, is to rai&s; the prices, to put the people by that
means on short allowance, and oblige them to spare their
food, till a more plentiful year. But in reality, the
encrea&s;e of prices is a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of &s;carcity;
and laws, in&s;tead of preventing it, only encrea&s;e the
evil, by cramping and re&s;training commerce. The par|liament
accordingly in, the en&s;uing year, repealed their
ordinance, which they had found u&s;ele&s;s and burden|&s;ome<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;. p. 107.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE prices affixed by the parliament are &s;omewhat
remarkable: Two pounds eight &s;hillings of our pre&s;ent
money for the be&s;t ox, not fed with corn: If fed with
corn, three pounds twelve &s;hillings: A fat hog of two
years old, ten shillings: A fat wether un&s;horn, a crown:
If &s;horn, three &s;hillings and &s;ix pence: A fat goo&s;e, &s;even
pence halfpenny: A fat capon, &s;ix pence: A fat hen,
three pence: Two chickens, three pence: Four pigeons,
three pence: Two dozen of eggs, three pence<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Rot. Parl. 7 Edw. II. n. 35, 36. Ypod. Neu&s;t. p. 502.</NOTE>. If we
con&s;ider the&s;e prices, we shall find, that butcher's meat,
in this time of great &s;carcity, must &s;till have been &s;old by
the parliamentary ordinance, three times cheaper than
our middling prices at pre&s;ent: Poultry &s;omewhat lower;
becau&s;e, being now con&s;idered as a delicacy, it has ri&s;en
beyond its proportion. In the country places of Ireland
and Scotland, where delicacies bear no price, poultry is at
pre&s;ent as cheap, if not cheaper, than butcher's meat. But
the inference I would draw from the compari&s;on of prices is
fill more con&s;iderable: I &s;uppo&s;e that the rates, affixed
by parliament, were inferior to the u&s;ual market prices
in tho&s;e years of famine and mortality of cattle; and
that the&s;e commodities, in&s;tead of a third, had really
<PB N="378" REF="407">
ri&s;en to a half of the pre&s;ent value. But the famine at
that time was &s;o con&s;uming, that wheat was &s;ometimes
&s;old for above four pounds ten &s;hillings a quarter<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Murimuth, p. 48. Wal&s;ingham, p. 108, &s;ays it ro&s;e to &s;ix pounds.</NOTE>, u&s;u|ally
for three pounds<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ypod. Neu&s;t. p. 502. Trivest, cont. p. 18.</NOTE>; that is, con&s;iderably above twice
our middling prices. A certain proof of the wretched
&s;tate of tillage in tho&s;e ages. We formerly found, that
the middling price of corn in that period was a half of
the pre&s;ent value; while the middling price of cattle was
only an eighth part: We here find the &s;ame immen&s;e di&s;|proportion
in years of &s;carcity. It may thence be infer|red
with certainty, that the rai&s;ing of corn was a &s;pecies
of manufactory, which, few in that age could practi&s;e
with advantage: And there is re&s;on to think, that other
manufactures more refined, were &s;old even beyond their
pre&s;ent prices: At lea&s;t there is a demon&s;tration for it in
the reign of Henry VII. from the prices affixed to &s;carlet
and other broad cloths by act of parliament. During all
tho&s;e times, it was u&s;ual for the princes and great nobi|lity
to make &s;ettlements of their velvet beds and &s;ilken
robes, in the &s;ame manner as of their e&s;tates and manors<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Dugdale.</NOTE>.
In the li&s;t of jewels and plate, which had belonged to
the oftentatious Gavafton, and which the King recovered
from the earl of Lanca&s;ter after the murder of that favou|rite,
we find &s;ome embroidered girdles, flowered &s;hirts,
and &s;ilk wai&s;tcoats<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iii. p. 388.</NOTE>. It was afterwards one article of
accu&s;ation again&s;t that potent and opulent earl, when
tried for his life, that he had, purloined &s;ome of the&s;e
effect&s; of Gava&s;ton. The ignorance of tho&s;e ages in
manufactures, and e&s;pecially in tillage, is a clear proof
that they were far from being populous.</P>
<P>ALL trade and manufactures indeed were then at a
very low ebb. The only country in the northern parts
<PB N="379" REF="408">
of Europe, where they &s;eem to have ri&s;en to any tolerable
degree of improvement, was Flanders. When Robert,
earl of that country, was applied to by Edward, and was
desired to break off commerce with the Scots, whom Ed|ward
called his rebels, and repre&s;ented as excommuni|cated
on that account by the church, the earl replied,
that Flanders, was always con&s;idered as common and free
and open to all nations<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iii. p. 770.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE petition of the elder Spen&s;er to parliament, com|plaining
of the deva&s;tation committed on his lands by the
barons, contains &s;everal particulars, which are curious,
and di&s;cover the manners of the age<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Brady's hi&s;t. vol. ii. p. 143, from Clau&s;. 15 Edw. II. M. 14. Dors in cedula.</NOTE>. He affirms, that
they had ravaged &s;ixty three manors belonging to him,
and he makes his lo&s;&s;es amount to 46,000 pounds; that
is, to 138,000 of our pre&s;ent money. Among other
particulars, he enumerates 28,000 &s;heep, 1000 oxen and
heifers, 1200 cows with their breed for two years, 560
cart hor&s;es, 2000 hogs, together with 600 bacons, 80
carcaf&s;es of beef, and 600 muttons in the larder;
ten tuns of cyder, arms for 200 men and other warlike en|gines
and provi&s;ions. The plain inference is, that the
greate&s;t part of Spen&s;er's va&s;t e&s;tate, as well as that of
the other nobility, was farmed by the landlord himself,
managed by his &s;tewards or bailiffs, and cultivated by his
villains. Little or none of it was let on lea&s;e to hu&s;band|men:
Its produce was con&s;umed in ru&s;tic ho&s;pitality by
the baron or his officers: A great number of idle retain|ers,
ready for any di&s;order or mi&s;chief, were maintained
by him: All who lived upon his e&s;tate were ab&s;olutely at
his di&s;po&s;al: In&s;ead of applying to courts of ju&s;tice, he
u&s;ually &s;ought redre&s;s by open force and violence; The
great nobility were a kind of independant potentates,
who, if they &s;ubmitted to any regulations at all, were
<PB N="380" REF="409">
le&s;s governed by the municipal law, than by a rude &s;pecies
of the laws of nations. The method in which we find
they treated the King's favourites, and mini&s;ters, is a
proof of their u&s;ual way of dealing with each other. A
party, which complains of the arbitrary conduct of mi|ni&s;ters,
ought naturally to affect a great regard for the
laws and con&s;titution, and maintain at lea&s;t the appear|ance
of ju&s;tice in their proceedings: Yet. the&s;e barons,
when di&s;contented, came to parliament with an armed
force, con&s;trained the King to a&s;&s;ent to their mea&s;ures,
and without any trial or witne&s;s or conviction, pa&s;&s;ed,
from the pretended notoriety of facts, an act of bani&s;h|ment
or attainder again&s;t the minister, which, on the
fir&s;t revolution of fortune, was rever&s;ed by like expe|dients.
The parliament, during factious times, was no|thing
but the organ of pre&s;ent power. Tho' the per&s;ons
of whom it was chiefly compo&s;ed, &s;eemed to enjoy great
ipdependance, they really po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no true liberty; and
the &s;ecurity of each individual among them, was not &s;o
much derived from the general protection of law, as from
his own private power and that of his confederates. The
authority of the monarch, tho' far from ab&s;olute, was
very irregular, and might often reach him: The current
of a faction might ea&s;ily overwhelm him: A hundred
con&s;iderations, of benefits and injuries, friend&s;hips and
animo&s;ities, hopes and fears, were able to influence his
conduit; and amidst the&s;e motives a regard to equity and
law and ju&s;tice was commonly, in tho&s;e rude ages, of
little moment. Nor did any man' entertain thoughts of
oppo&s;ing pre&s;ent power, who did not deem himself &s;trong
enough to di&s;pute the field with it by force, and was not
prepared to give battle to the &s;overeign or the ruling party.</P>
<P>BEFORE I conclude this reign, I cannot forbear making
another remark drawn from the detail of lo&s;&s;es given in
<PB N="381" REF="410">
by the elder Spen&s;er; particularly the great quantity
of &s;alt meat which he had in his larder, 600 bacons, 80
carca&s;&s;es of beef, 600 muttons. We may ob&s;erve that
the outrage, of which he complains, began after the third
of May, as we learn from the &s;ame paper. It is ea&s;y
therefore to conjecture what a va&s;t &s;tore of the &s;ame kind
he mu&s;t have laid up at the beginning of winter; and we
may draw a new conclu&s;ion with regard to the wretched
&s;tate of the antient hu&s;bandry, which could not provide
any &s;ub&s;i&s;tance for the cattle during winter, even in &s;uch
a temperate climate as the &s;outh of England: For Spen&s;er
had but one manor &s;o far north as York&s;hire. There
being few or no enclo&s;ures, except perhaps for deer, no
&s;own gra&s;s, little hay, and no other re&s;ources for feeding
cattle; the barons, as well as the people, were obliged
to kill and &s;alt their oxen and sheep at the beginning
of winter, before they became lean upon the common pa&s;|ture:
A precaution &s;till practi&s;ed with regard to oxen in
the lea&s;t cultivated parts of this i&s;land. The &s;alting of
mutton is a mi&s;erable expedient, which has every where
been long di&s;u&s;ed. From this circumstance, however
trivial in appearance, may be drawn very important in|ferences,
with regard to the domestic oeconomy and man|ner
of life in tho&s;e ages.</P>
<P>THE di&s;orders of the times, from foreign wars and
inte&s;tine di&s;&s;entions, but above all, the cruel famine,
which obliged the nobility to di&s;mi&s;s many of their re|tainers,
encrea&s;ed the number of robbers in the king|dom;
and no place was &s;ecure from their incur&s;ions.<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ypod. Neust. p. 502. Wal&s;. p. 107.</NOTE>.
They met in troops like armies, and over-ran the
country. Two cardinals, them&s;elves, the Pope's legates,
notwithstanding the numerous train, which attended
<PB N="382" REF="411">
them, were robbed, and de&s;poiled of all their goods and
equipage, when they travelled on the road<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ypod. Neu&s;tr. p. 503. T. de la More, p. 594. Trivet, co$$. p. 22. Murimuth, p. 51.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AMONG the other wild fancies of the age, it was ima|gined,
that the per&s;ons affected with lepro&s;y, a di&s;ea&s;e at
that time very common, had con&s;pired with the Saracens
to poi&s;on all the &s;prings and fountains; and men being
glad of any pretence to get rid of tho&s;e who were a bur|then
to them, many of tho&s;e unhappy people were burnt
alive for this chimerical imputation. Several Jews al&s;o
were puni&s;hed in their per&s;ons, and their goods confi&s;|cated
on the &s;ame account<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ypod. Neu&s;t. p. 504.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS King left four children, two sons and two
daughters: Edward, his eldest &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or; John,
created afterwards earl of Cornwal, who died young at
Perth; Jane, afterwards married to David Bruce, King
of Scotland; and Eleanor, married to Reginald, count of Gueldres.</P>

deemed it requi&s;ite for their future &s;ecurity to pay
&s;o far an exterior obei&s;ance to the law, as to demand a
parliamentary indemnity for all their illegal proceedings;
on account of the nece&s;&s;ity; which, it was pretended,
they lay under, of employing force again&s;t the Spen&s;ers
and other evil coun&s;ellors, the enemies of the kingdom.
All the attainders al&s;o, which had pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t the earl
of Lanca&s;ter and his adherents, when the chance of war
turned again&s;t them, were ea&s;ily rever&s;ed during the tri|umph
of their party<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iv. p. 245, 247, 258, &amp;c.</NOTE>; and the Spen&s;ers, who&s;e former
attainder had been rever&s;ed by parliament, were now
again, in this change of fortune, condemned by the votes
of their enemies. A council of regency was likewi&s;e ap|pointed
by parliament, consisting of twelve per&s;ons; five
prelates, the archbi&s;hops of Canterbury and York, the bi|&s;hops
<PB N="384" REF="413">
of Winche&s;ter, Worce&s;ter, and Hereford; and &s;even
lay peers, the earls of Norfolk, Kent and Surrey, and the
lords Wake, Ingham, Piercy, and Ro&s;s. The earl of Lan|caster
was appointed guardian and protector of the King's
per&s;on. But though it was rea&s;onable to expect, that, as
the weakne&s;s of the former King had given reins to the
licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the barons, great tranquillity would not
prevail during the pre&s;ent minority; the fir&s;t di&s;turbance
aro&s;e from the inva&s;ion of foreign enemies.</P>
<P>THE King of Scots,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with Scotland.</NOTE> declining in years and health,
but retaining &s;till that martial &s;pirit, which had rai&s;ed his
nation from the lowe&s;t ebb of fortune, deemed the pre|&s;ent
opportunity favourable for infe&s;ting England: He
first made an attempt on the ca&s;tle of Norham, in which
he was di&s;appointed; he then collected an army of 25,000
men on the frontiers, and having appointed the earl of
Murray and lord Douglas generals, threatened an incur|&s;ion
into the northern counties. The English regency,
after trying in vain every expedient to re&s;tore peace with
Scotland, made vigorous preparations for war; and be|&s;ides
a&s;&s;embling an English army of near &s;ixty thou&s;and
men, they invited back John de Hainault, and &s;ome fo|reign
cavalry, whom they had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and who&s;e di&s;|cipline
and arms had appeared &s;uperior to tho&s;e of their own
country. Young Edward him&s;elf, burning with a pa&s;&s;ion
for military fame, appeared at the head of the&s;e numerous
forces; and marched from Durham, the appointed place
of rendevous, in que&s;t of the enemy, who had already
broke into the frontiers, and were laying every thing
wa&s;te around them with fire and &s;word.</P>
<P>MURRAY and Douglas were the two mo&s;t celebrated
warriors, bred in the long ho&s;tilities between the Scots
and English; and their forces, trained in the &s;ame &s;chool,
and enured to hard&s;hips, fatigues, and dangers, were
<PB N="385" REF="414">
perfectly qualified, by their habits and manner of life,
for that de&s;ultory and de&s;trutive war, which they carried on
again&s;t the Engli&s;h. Except a body of about 4000 ca|valry,
well armed, and fit to make a &s;teddy impre&s;&s;on in
battle, the re&s;t of the army were mounted on &s;mall hor&s;es,
which found &s;ub&s;i&s;tance every where, and carried them
with rapid and unexpected marches, whether they meant
to commit depredations on the peaceable inhabitants, or to
attack an armed enemy, or to retreat into their own country.
The whole equipage of the troops con&s;i&s;ted of a bag of oat
meal, which, as a &s;upply in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, each &s;oldier
carried behind him; together with a light plate of iron, on
which he instantly baked the oat meal into a cake, in the
open fields. But his chief &s;ub&s;i&s;tance was the cattle which
he &s;eized; and his cookery was as expeditious as all his
other operations. After fleaing the animal, he placed
the &s;kin, loo&s;e and hanging in the form of a bag, upon
&s;ome &s;takes; he poured water into it, kindled a fire
below, and thus made it &s;erve as a cauldron for the boil|ing
of his victuals<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. iv. chap. 18.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE chief difficulty, which Edward met with, after
compo&s;ing &s;ome dangerous frays, which broke out be|tween
his foreign forces and the Engli&s;h<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. i. chap. 17.</NOTE>, was to come
up with an enemy, &s;o rapid in their marches, and &s;o
little encumbered in their motions. Tho' the flame and
&s;moke of burning villages directed him &s;ufficiently to the
place of their encampment, he found upon hurrying thi|ther,
that they had already di&s;lodged; and he loon di&s;co|vered,
by new marks of deva&s;tation, that they had re|moved
to &s;ome di&s;tant quarter. After harra&s;&s;ing his
army during &s;ome time in this fruitle&s;s chace, he advanced
northwards, and cro&s;&s;ed the Tyne, with a re&s;olution of
awaiting them on their return homewards, and taking
<PB N="386" REF="415">
vengeance on them for all their depredations<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv iv. chap. 19.</NOTE>. But that
whole country was already &s;o much wa&s;ted by their fre|quent
incur&s;ions, that it could not afford &s;ub&s;i&s;tance to
his army; and he was obliged again to return &s;outh|wards,
and change his plan of operations. He had now
lo&s;t all track of the enemy; and tho' he promi&s;ed the re|ward
of a hundred pounds a year to any one who &s;hould
bring him an account of their motions, he remained un|active
&s;ome days, before he received any intelligence of
them<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iv. p. 312. Froi&s;&s;art, liv. iv. chap. 19.</NOTE>. He found at la&s;t, that they had fixed their camp
on the &s;outhern banks of the Were, as if they intended
to await a battle; but their prudent leaders had cho&s;en
the ground with &s;uch judgment, that the English, on
their approach, found it impracticable, without temerity,
to cro&s;s the river in their face, and attack them in their
pre&s;sent &s;ituation. Edward, impatient for revenge and
glory, here &s;ent them a defiance, and challenged them,
if they dared, to meet him in an equal field, and try the
fortune of arms. The bold &s;pirit of Douglas could ill
brook this bravade, and he advi&s;ed the acceptance of the
challenge; but he was over-ruled by Murray, who re|plied
to Edward, that he never took the council of an
enemy in any of his operations. The King, therefore,
kept &s;till his po&s;ition oppo&s;ite to them; and expected
daily, that nece&s;&s;ity would oblige them to change their
quarters, and give him an opportunity of overwhelming
them with his &s;uperior forces. After a few days, they
&s;uddenly decamped, and marched farther up the river;
but &s;till po&s;ted them&s;elves in &s;uch a manner, as to pre|&s;erve
the advantage of the ground, if the enemy &s;hould
venture to attack them<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. iv. chap. 19.</NOTE>. Edward in&s;i&s;ted, that all ha|zards
&s;hould be run, rather than allow the&s;e ravagers to
<PB N="387" REF="416">
e&s;cape with impunity; but Mortimer's authority pre|vented
the a&s;&s;ault, and oppo&s;ed it&s;elf to the valour of the
young monarch. While the armies lay in this po&s;ition,
an incident happened which had well nigh proved fatal
to the Engli&s;h. Douglas, having got the word, and
&s;urveyed exactly the &s;ituation of the Engli&s;h camp, en|tered
it &s;ecretly in the night time, with a body of two
hundred determined &s;oldiers, and advanced to the royal
tent, with a view of killing or carrying off the prince,
in the mid&s;t of his whole army. But &s;ome of Edward's
attendants, awaking in that critical moment, made re|&s;i&s;tance;
his chaplain and chamberlain &s;acrificed their
lives for his &s;afety; the King him&s;elf, after making a
valiant defence, e&s;caped in the dark: And Douglas,
having lo&s;t the greate&s;t part of his followers, was glad to
make a ha&s;ty retreat with the remainder<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. iv. chap. 19. Hemingford, p. 268. Ypod. Neu&s;t. p. 509. Knyghton, p. 2552.</NOTE>. Soon after,
the Scotti&s;h army decamped without noi&s;e in the dead of
night; and having thus got the &s;tart of the Engli&s;h,
arrived without farther lo&s;s in their own country. Ed|ward,
on entering the place of the Scotti&s;h encampment,
found only &s;ix Engli&s;hmen, whom the enemy, after
breaking their legs, had tied to trees, in order to pre|vent
their carrying any intelligence to their country|men<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. iv. chap. 19.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King was highly incen&s;ed at the di&s;appointment,
which he had met with, in his fir&s;t enterprize, and at the
head of &s;o gallant an army. The &s;ymptoms, which he
had di&s;covered of bravery and &s;pirit, gave extreme &s;ati&s;|fation,
and were regarded as &s;ure progno&s;tics of an il|lu&s;trious
reign: But the general di&s;plea&s;ure fell violently
on Mortimer, who was already the object of public
odium: And every mea&s;ure which he pur&s;ued, tended to
<PB N="388" REF="417">
aggravate, beyond all bounds, the hatred of the nation
both again&s;t him and Queen I&s;abella.</P>
<P>WHEN the council of regency was formed, Mortimer,
though in the plenitude of his power, had taken no care
to en&s;ure a place in it; but this &s;emblance of moderation
was only a cover to the mo&s;t exorbitant and mo&s;t ambi|tious
projects. He rendered that council entirely u&s;ele&s;s
by u&s;urping to him&s;elf the whole &s;overeign power; he
&s;ettled on the Queen-dowager the greater part of the
royal revenues; he never con&s;ulted either the princes
of the blood or the other noblemen in any public mea|&s;ure;
the King him&s;elf was &s;o be&s;ieged by his creatures,
that no acce&s;s could be procured to him; and all
the envy, which had attended Gava&s;ton and Spen&s;er, fell
much more de&s;ervedly on this new favourite.</P>
<P>MORTIMER,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1328.</NOTE> &s;en&s;ible of the growing hatred of the
people, thought it requi&s;ite, on any terms, to &s;ecure
peace abroad; and he entered into a negociation with
Robert Bruce for that purpo&s;e. As the claim of &s;upe|riority
in England, more than any other cau&s;e, had
tended to inflame the animo&s;ities between the two nations,
Mortimer con&s;ented to re&s;ign ab&s;olutely this preten&s;ion,
to give up all the homages done by the Scotti&s;h parlia|ment
and nobility, and to acknowledge Robert as &s;ove|reign
of Scotland<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Rymer, p. 337. Heming. p. 270. Anon. Hi&s;t. p. 392.</NOTE>. In return for the&s;e mighty ad|vantages,
Robert only &s;tipulated the payment of 30,000
marks to England. This treaty was ratified by parlia|ment<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ypod. Neu&s;t. p. 510.</NOTE>;
but was neverthele&s;s the &s;ource of great di&s;con|tent
among the people, who, having entered zealou&s;ly
into the preten&s;ions of Edward I. and deeming them|&s;elves
di&s;graced by the &s;ucce&s;sful re&s;i&s;tance of &s;o inferior
<PB N="389" REF="418">
a nation, were di&s;appointed by this treaty, in all future
hopes both of conque&s;t and of vengeance.</P>
<P>THE princes of the blood, Kent, Norfolk, and Lan|ca&s;ter,
were very much united in their councils; and
Mortimer entertained great &s;u&s;picions of their de&s;igns
again&s;t him. In &s;ummoning them to parliament, he
&s;trictly prohibited them, in the King's name, from being
attended with an armed force, an illegal but u&s;ual prac|tice
in that age. The three earls, as they approached to
Sali&s;bury, the place appointed for the meeting of par|liament,
found, that, tho' they them&s;elves, in obedience
to the King's command, had brought only their u&s;ual
retinue along with them, Mortimer and his party were
attended with all their followers in arms; and they be|gan
with &s;ome rea&s;on to apprehend a dangerous de&s;ign
again&s;t their per&s;ons. They therefore retreated, a&s;&s;em|bled
their retainers, and were returning with an army to
take vengeance on Mortimer, when the weakne&s;s of
Kent and Norfolk, who de&s;erted the common cau&s;e,
obliged Lanca&s;ter al&s;o to make his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Knyghton, p. 2554.</NOTE>. The
quarrel, by the interpo&s;ition of the prelates, &s;eemed for
the pre&s;ent to be appea&s;ed.</P>
<P>BUT Mortimer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1329.</NOTE> in order to intimidate the princes, de|termined
to have a victim; and the &s;implicity, with the
good intentions of the earl of Kent, afforded him &s;oon
after an opportunity of practi&s;ing upon him. By him&s;elf
and his emi&s;&s;aries, he endeavoured to per&s;uade that prince,
that his brother, King Edward, was &s;till alive, and con|cealed
in &s;ome &s;ecret pri&s;on in England. The earl, who&s;e
remor&s;es for the part which he had acted again&s;t the late
King, probably inclined him to give credit to this intelli|gence,
entered into a de&s;ign of re&s;toring him to liberty,
of re-in&s;tating him on the throne, and thereby of making
<PB N="390" REF="419">
&s;ome compen&s;ation for the injuries he had unwarily done
him<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ave&s;bury, p. 8. Anon. Hi&s;t. p. 395.</NOTE>. After this innocent contrivance had been al|lowed
to proceed a certain length,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1330.</NOTE> the earl was &s;eized
by Mortimer, was accu&s;ed before the parliament, and
condemned by the&s;e &s;lavi&s;h, tho' turbulent barons, to
lo&s;e his life and fortune.<NOTE PLACE="marg">9th March. Execution of the earl of Kent.</NOTE> The queen and Mortimer,
apprehen&s;ive of young Edward's lenity towards his uncle,
hurried on the execution, and the pri&s;oner was beheaded
next day: But &s;o general was the affection borne the
earl, and &s;uch pity prevailed for his hard fate, that, tho'
peers had been ea&s;ily found, to condemn him, it was
evening before his enemies could find an executioner to
perform the office<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Heming. p. 271. Ypod. Neu&s;t. p. 510. Knyghton, p. 2555.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE earl of Lanca&s;ter, on pretence of his a&s;&s;ent to
this con&s;piracy, was &s;oon after thrown into pri&s;on: Many
others of the prelates and nobility were pro&s;ecuted: Mor|timer
employed this engine to cru&s;h all his enemies, and
enrich him&s;elf and his family by the forfeitures. The
e&s;tate of the earl of Kent was &s;eized for his younger &s;on,
Geoffrey: The immen&s;e fortunes of the Spen&s;ers and
their adherents were mo&s;tly converted to his own u&s;e:
He affected a &s;tate and dignity equal or &s;uperior to the
royal: His power became formidable to every one: His
illegal practices were daily complained of: And all par|ties,
forgetting former animo&s;ities, con&s;pired in their ha|tred
again&s;t Mortimer.</P>
<P>IT was impo&s;&s;ible, that the&s;e abu&s;es could long e&s;cape
the ob&s;ervation of a prince, endowed with &s;o much &s;pirit
and judgment as young Edward, who being now in his
eighteenth year, and feeling him&s;elf capable of govern|ment,
repined at being held in fetters by this in&s;olent
mini&s;ter. But &s;o much was he &s;urrounded with the
<PB N="391" REF="420">
emi&s;&s;aries of Mortimer, that it behoved him to conduct
the project for &s;ubverting him, with the &s;ame &s;ecrecy and
precaution, as if he had been forming a con&s;piracy again&s;t
his &s;overeign. He communicated his intentions to the
lord Mountacute, who engaged the lords Molins and
Clifford, &s;ir John Nevil of Hornby, &s;ir Edward Bohun,
Ufford, and others, to enter into their views; and the
ca&s;tle of Nottingham was cho&s;en for the &s;cene of the en|terprize.
The Queen-dowager and Mortimer lodged in
that fortre&s;s: The King al&s;o was admitted, tho' with a
few only of his attendants: And as the ca&s;tle was &s;trictly
guarded, the gates locked every evening, and the keys
carried to the Queen, it became nece&s;&s;ary to communi|cate
the de&s;ign to &s;ir William Eland, the governor, who
entered zealou&s;ly into it. By his direction, the King's
a&s;&s;ociates were admitted thro' a &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;age,
which had been formerly contrived for a &s;ecret outlet to
the ca&s;tle, but was now buried in rubbi&s;h; and Morti|mer,
without having it in his power to make re&s;i&s;tance,
was &s;uddenly &s;eized in an apartment adjoining to the
Queen's<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ave&s;bury, p. 9.</NOTE>. A parliament was immediately called for his
trial. He was accu&s;ed before that a&s;&s;embly of having
u&s;urped regal power from the council of regency, ap|pointed
by parliament; of having procured the death of
the late King; of having deceived the earl of Kent into
a con&s;piracy to re&s;tore that prince; of having &s;olicited
and obtained exorbitant grants of the royal deme&s;nes;
of having di&s;&s;ipated the public trea&s;ure; of &s;ecreting for
his own u&s;e 20,000 marks of the money paid by the
King of Scotland; and of other crimes and mi&s;demea|nours<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Brady's App. N^o. 83. Anon. Hi&s;t. p. 397, 398. Knyghton, p. 2556.</NOTE>.
The parliament condemned him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Execution of Morti|mer. 29th Nov.</NOTE> from the
&s;uppo&s;ed notoriety of the facts, without trial, or hearing
his an&s;wer, or examining a witne&s;s; and he was hanged
<PB N="392" REF="421">
on a gibbet at the Elmes, in the neighbourhood of Lon|don.
It is remarkable, that this &s;entence was near twenty
years after rever&s;ed by parliament, in favour of Mortimer's
&s;on; and the rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned was the illegal form of the
proceedings<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Cotton's Abridg. p. 85, 86.</NOTE>. The principles of law and ju&s;tice were
e&s;tabli&s;hed in England, not in &s;uch a degree as to prevent
any iniquitous &s;entence again&s;t a per&s;on obnoxious to
the ruling party; but &s;ufficient, on the return of his
credit, or that of his friends, to &s;erve as a rea&s;on or pre|tence
for its rever&s;al.</P>
<P>JUSTICE was also executed by a &s;entence of the hou&s;e of
peers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1331.</NOTE> on &s;ome of the inferior criminals, particularly on Si|mon
de Bereford: But the barons, in that ca&s;e, entered a
prote&s;t, that, tho' they had tried Bereford, who was none of
their peers, they &s;hould not for the future be obliged to
receive any &s;uch indictment. The Queen was confined
to her own hou&s;e at Ri&s;ings near London: Her revenue
was reduced to 4000 pounds a year<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Cotton's Abridg. p. 10.</NOTE>: And tho' the King,
during the remainder of her life, paid her a decent vi&s;it
once or twice a year, &s;he never was able to rein&s;tate
her&s;elf in any credit or authority.</P>
<P>EDWARD, having now taken the reins of govern|ment
into his own hands, applied him&s;elf, with indu&s;try
and judgment, to redre&s;s all tho&s;e grievances, which had
either proceeded from want of authority in the crown,
or from the late abu&s;es of it. He i&s;&s;ued writs to the
judges, enjoining them to admini&s;ter ju&s;tice, without
paying any regard to arbitrary orders from the mini&s;ters:
And as the robbers, thieves, murderers, and criminals of
all kinds, had, during the cour&s;e of public convul&s;ions,
multiplied to an enormous degree, and were openly pro|tected
by the great barons, who made u&s;e of them again&s;t
<PB N="393" REF="422">
their enemies, the King, after exacting from the
peers a &s;olemn promi&s;e in parliament, that they would
break off all connexions with &s;uch malefactors<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Cotton's Abridg.</NOTE>, &s;et
him&s;elf in earne&s;t to remedy the evil. Many of the&s;e
gangs had become &s;o numerous, as to require his own
pre&s;ence to di&s;&s;ipate them; and he exerted both courage
and indu&s;try in executing this &s;alutary office. The mi|ni&s;ters
of ju&s;tice, from his example, employed the utmo&s;t
diligence in di&s;covering, pur&s;uing, and puni&s;hing the
criminals; and this di&s;order was by degrees corrected, or
at lea&s;t palliated; the utmo&s;t that could be expected with
regard to a di&s;ea&s;e, inherent in the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>IN proportion as the government acquired authority at
home,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of Scotland.</NOTE> it became formidable to the neighbouring nations;
and the ambitious &s;pirit of Edward &s;ought, and &s;oon
found, an opportunity of exerting it&s;elf. The wi&s;e and
valiant Robert Bruce, who had recovered by arms the in|dependancy
of his country, and had fixed it by the la&s;t
treaty of peace with England, &s;oon after died, and left
David his &s;on, a minor, under the guardian&s;hip of Ran|dolf,
earl of Murray, the companion of all his victories.
It had been &s;tipulated in this treaty, that both the Scot|tish
nobility, who, before the commencement of the
wars, enjoyed lands in England, and the Engli&s;h who
inherited e&s;tates in Scotland, &s;hould be re&s;tored to their
&s;everal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iv. p. 384.</NOTE>: But tho' this article had been exe|cuted
pretty regularly on the part of Edward, Robert,
who &s;aw the e&s;tates claimed by Engli&s;hmen much more
numerous and valuable than the other, either e&s;teemed
it dangerous to admit &s;o many &s;ecret enemies into the
kingdom, or found it difficult to wre&s;t from his own fol|lowers
the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions be&s;towed on them as the reward of
their fatigues and dangers: And he had protracted the
performance of his part of the &s;tipulation. The English
<PB N="394" REF="423">
nobles, di&s;appointed in their expectations, began to think
of a remedy; and as their influence was great in the
north, their enmity alone, even tho' un&s;upported by the
King of England, became dangerous to the minor prince,
who &s;ucceeded to the Scotti&s;h throne.</P>
<P>EDWARD BALIOL,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1332.</NOTE> the &s;on of that John, who was
crowned King of Scotland, had been detained &s;ome time
a pri&s;oner in England after his father was relea&s;ed; but
having al&s;o obtained his liberty, he went over to France,
and lived in Normandy, on his patrimonial e&s;tate in
that country, without any thoughts of reviving the
claims of his family upon the crown of Scotland. His
preten&s;ions, however plau&s;ible, had been &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly
abjured by the Scots, and rejected by the Engli&s;h, that
he was entirely regarded as a private per&s;on; and he had
been thrown into pri&s;on on account of &s;ome private of|fence
again&s;t the laws, of which he was accu&s;ed. The
lord Beaumont, a great Engli&s;h baron, who in the right
of his wife claimed the earldom of Buchan in Scotland<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iv. p. 251.</NOTE>,
found him in this &s;ituation; and deeming him a proper
in&s;trument for his purpo&s;e, made &s;uch intere&s;t with the
King of France, who was not aware of the con&s;equen|ces,
that he recovered him his liberty, and brought him
over with him into England.</P>
<P>THE injured nobles, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch a head, began
now to think of vindicating their rights by force of
arms; and they applied to Edward for his concurrence
and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. But there were &s;everal rea&s;ons, which
deterred the King from openly avowing their enterprize.
In his treaty with Scotland, he had entered into a bond
of 20,000 pounds, payable to the Pope, if within four
years he violated the peace; and as the term was not
yet elap&s;ed, he dreaded the exacting of that penalty, by
<PB N="395" REF="424">
the &s;overeign pontiff, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;d &s;o many means of
forcing him to make payment. He was al&s;o afraid,
that violence and inju&s;tice would every where be im|puted
to him, if he attacked with &s;uch &s;uperior force a
minor King, and a brother-in-law, who&s;e independent
title had &s;o lately been acknowledged by a &s;olemn treaty.
And as the regent of Scotland, on every demand which
had been made, of re&s;titution to the Engli&s;h barons,
had always confe&s;&s;ed the ju&s;tice of their claim, and
had only given an eva&s;ive an&s;wer, grounded on plau&s;ible
pretences, Edward re&s;olved not to proceed to open vio|lence,
but to employ like artifices again&s;t him. He &s;e|cretly
encouraged Baliol in his enterprize; connived at
his a&s;&s;embling forces in the north; and gave countenance
to the nobles, who were di&s;po&s;ed to join in the attempt.
A force of near 2500 men was inli&s;ted under Baliol, by
Umfreville earl of Angus, the lords Beaumont, Ferrars,
Fitz-warin, Wake, Stafford, Talbot, and Moubray.
And as the&s;e adventurers apprehended that the frontiers
would be &s;trongly armed and guarded, they re&s;olved to
make their attack by &s;ea; and having embarked at Ra|ven&s;pur,
they reached in a few days the coa&s;t of Fife.</P>
<P>SCOTLAND was at pre&s;ent in a very different &s;ituation
from that in which it had appeared under the victorious
Robert. Be&s;ides the lo&s;s of that great monarch, who&s;e
genius and authority pre&s;erved entire the whole poli|tical
fabric, and maintained an union among the unruly
barons, lord Douglas, impatient of re&s;t, had gone over
to Spain in a cru&s;ade again&s;t the Moors, and had there
peri&s;hed in battle<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 21.</NOTE>: The earl of Murray, who had been
long declining in age and infirmities, had lately died,
and had been &s;ucceeded in the regency by Donald earl
of Marre, a man of much inferior talents: The mili|tary
&s;pirit of the Scots, tho' &s;till unbroken, was left
<PB N="396" REF="425">
without a proper guidance and direction: And a minor
King &s;eemed ill qualified to defend an inheritance,
which it had required all the con&s;ummate valour and
abilities of his father to acquire and maintain. But as
the Scots were apprized of the intended inva&s;ion, great
numbers, on the appearance of the Engli&s;h fleet, imme|diately
ran to the &s;hore, in order to prevent the landing
of the enemy. Baliol had valour and activity, and he
repul&s;ed the Scots with a con&s;iderable lo&s;s<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Heming. p. 272. Wal&s;ing. p. 131. Knyghton, p. 2560.</NOTE>. He marched
we&s;tward into the heart of the country; flattering him|&s;elf
that the antient partizans of his family would de|clare
for him. But the fierce animo&s;ity, which had
been kindled between the two nations, in&s;piring the
Scots with a &s;trong prejudice again&s;t a prince who was
&s;upported by the Engli&s;h, he was regarded as a common
enemy; and the regent found no difficulty in a&s;&s;embling
a great army to oppo&s;e him. It is pretended, that Marre
had no le&s;s than 40,000 men under his &s;tandard; but
the &s;ame hurry and impatience, that made him collect
a force, which from its greatne&s;s was &s;o di&s;proportioned
to the occa&s;ion, rendered all his motions un&s;kilful and
imprudent. The river Erne ran between the two armies;
and the Scots, confiding in that &s;ecurity, as well as in
their great &s;uperiority of numbers, kept no order in
their encampment.<NOTE PLACE="marg">12th Aug.</NOTE> Baliol pa&s;&s;ed the river in the night
time; attacked the unguarded and undi&s;ciplined Scots;
threw them into confu&s;ion, which was encrea&s;ed by the
darkne&s;s and by their very numbers to which they
tru&s;ted; and he beat them off the field with great
&s;laughter<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Knyghton, p. 2561.</NOTE>. But in the morning, when the Scots were
at &s;ome di&s;tance, they were a&s;hamed of having yielded
the victory to &s;o weak a foe, and they hurried back to
recover the honour of the day. Their eager pa&s;&s;ions
<PB N="397" REF="426">
carried them precipitately to battle, without regard to
&s;ome broken ground, which lay between them and the
enemy, and which di&s;ordered and confounded their
ranks. Baliol &s;eized the favourable opportunity, ad|vanced
his troops upon them, prevented them from ral|lying,
and chaced them anew off the field with redoubled
&s;laughter. There fell above 12,000 Scots in this action;
and among the&s;e the flower of their nobility; the re|gent
him&s;elf, the earl of Carric, a natural &s;on of their
late King, the earls of Athole and Monteith, the lord
Hay of Errol, con&s;table, and the lords Keith and Lind|&s;ey.
The lo&s;s of the Engli&s;h &s;carce exceeded thirty
men; a &s;trong proof, among many others, of the mi&s;er|able
&s;tate of military di&s;cipline in tho&s;e ages<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Heming. p. 273. Wal&s;ingham, p. 131. Knyghton, p. 2561.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BALIOL &s;oon after made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Perth;
but &s;till was not able to bring over any of the Scots to
his party. Patric Dunbar, earl of Marche, and Sir
Archibald Douglas, brother to the lord of that name,
appeared at the head of the Scotti&s;h armies, which
amounted &s;till to near 40,000 men; and they propo&s;ed to
reduce Baliol and the Engli&s;h by famine. They in|ve&s;ted
Perth by land; they collected &s;ome ve&s;&s;els with
which they blockaded it by water: But Baliol's &s;hips
attacking the Scotti&s;h fleet, gained a compleat victory
over them; and opened the communication to Perth by
&s;ea<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Heming. p. 273. Knyghton, p. 2561.</NOTE>. It then behoved the Scots armies to di&s;per&s;e
them&s;elves for want of pay and &s;ub&s;i&s;tance: The nation
was in effect &s;ubdued by a handful of men: Each no|bleman,
who found him&s;elf mo&s;t expo&s;ed to danger,
&s;ucce&s;&s;ively &s;ubmitted to Baliol:<NOTE PLACE="marg">27th Septr.</NOTE> That prince was crown|ed
King at Scone: David, his competitor, was &s;ent
over to France with his betrothed wife, Jane, &s;i&s;ter to
Edward: And the heads of his party &s;ued to Baliol for
<PB N="398" REF="427">
a truce, which he granted them, in order to a&s;&s;emble
a parliament in tranquillity, and have his title recog|nized
by the whole Scottish nation.</P>
<P>BUT Baliol's imprudence or his nece&s;&s;ities making him
di&s;mi&s;s the greate&s;t part of his English followers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1333.</NOTE> he was,
notwith&s;tanding the truce, attacked of a &s;udden near
Annan by Sir Archibald Douglas, and other chieftains
of that party; he was routed; his brother John Baliol
was &s;lain; he him&s;elf was chaced into England in a mi|&s;erable
condition; and thus lo&s;t his kingdom by a revo|lution
as quick as that by which he had acquired it.</P>
<P>WHILE Baliol enjoyed his &s;hort-liv'd and precarious
royalty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with Scotland.</NOTE> he had been &s;en&s;ible, that without the protect|tion
of England, it would be impo&s;&s;ible for him to
maintain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne; and he had &s;ecretly
&s;ent a me&s;&s;age to Edward, offering to acknowledge his
&s;uperiority, to renew the homage for his crown,
and to e&s;pou&s;e the prince&s;s Jane, if the Pope's
con&s;ent could be obtained, for di&s;&s;olving her former
marriage, which was not yet con&s;ummated. Edward,
ambitious of recovering that important &s;acrifice,
made by Mortimer during his minority, threw off all &s;cruples,
and willingly accepted the offer; but as the dethrone|ment
of Baliol had rendered this conce&s;&s;ion of no ef|fect,
the King prepared to re-in&s;tate him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
the crown; an enterprize, which appeared from late
experience &s;o ea&s;y and &s;o little hazardous. As he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
many popular arts, he con&s;ulted his parliament
on this occa&s;ion; but that a&s;&s;embly, finding the re&s;olution
already taken, declined giving any opinion, and only
&s;upplied him, in order to &s;upport the enterprize, with
an aid of a fifteenth, from the per&s;onal e&s;tates of the
nobility and gentry, and a tenth of the moveables of
boroughs. And they added a petition, that the King
<PB N="399" REF="428">
would thenceforth live of his own, without grieving his
subjects by illegal taxes, or by the outrageous &s;eizure of
their goods in the &s;hape of purveyance<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Cotton's Abridgm.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AS the Scots expected, that the chief brunt of the
war would fall upon Berwic, Douglas, the regent,
threw a &s;trong garri&s;on into that place under the com|mand
of Sir William Keith, and he him&s;elf a&s;&s;embled
a great army on the frontiers, ready to penetrate into
England, &s;o &s;oon as Edward &s;hould have inve&s;ted that
fortre&s;s. The Engli&s;h army was lets numerous; but
better &s;upplied with arms and provi&s;ions, and retained
in &s;tricter discipline; and the King, notwithstanding
the valiant defence of Keith, had in two months time
reduced the garri&s;on to extremity, and had obliged them
to capitulate. They engaged to &s;urrender the place, if
they were not relieved within a few days by their coun|trymen<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iv. p. 564, 565, 566.</NOTE>.
This intelligence, being conveyed to the
Scotti&s;h army, which was preparing to invade Northum|berland,
changed their whole plan of operations, and
engaged them to advance towards Berwic, and attempt
the relief of that important place. Douglas, who had
ever propo&s;ed to decline a pitched battle, in which he
was &s;en&s;ible of the enemy's &s;uperiority, and who intended
to have drawn out the war by &s;mall &s;kirmi&s;hes, and by
mutually ravaging each others country, was forced, by
the impatience of his troops, to put the whole fate of
the kingdom upon the event of one day. He attacked
the Engli&s;h at Halidown-hill, a little north of Berwic;<NOTE PLACE="marg">19th July.</NOTE>
and tho' the Scotti&s;h <HI>Gens d' armes</HI> di&s;mounted from their
hor&s;es, in order to render the action more &s;teady and
de&s;perate, they were received with &s;uch valour by Edward,
and were &s;o galled by the Engli&s;h archers, that they
were &s;oon thrown into di&s;order, and on the fall of
Douglas, their general, were put to ab&s;olute rout. The
<PB N="400" REF="429">
whole army fled in confu&s;ion, and the Engli&s;h, but
much more the Iri&s;h, gave little quarter in the pur&s;uit:
All the nobles of chief di&s;tinction were either &s;lain or
taken pri&s;oners: Near thirty thou&s;and of the Scots fell
in the action: While the lo&s;s of the Engli&s;h amounted
only to one knight, one, e&s;quire, and thirteen private
&s;oldiers: An inequality almost incredible<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Heming, p. 275, 276, 277. Knyghton, p. 2559. Otterborne, p. 115.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER this fatal blow, the Scotti&s;h nobles had no
other re&s;ource but in&s;tant &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and Edward,
leaving a con&s;iderable body with Baliol to compleat
the conque&s;t of the kingdom, returned with the re|mainder
of his army into England. Baliol was ac|knowledged
King by a parliament a&s;&s;embled at Edin|burgh<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iv. p. 590.</NOTE>;
the &s;uperiority of England was again recognized;
many of the Scots nobility &s;wore fealty to him; and to
compleat the misfortunes of that nation, Baliol ceded to
Edward Berwic, Dunbar, Roxborough, Edinburgh, and
all the &s;outh-ea&s;t counties of Scotland, which were de|clared
to be for ever annexed to the Engli&s;h monarchy<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iv. p. 614.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IF Baliol,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1334.</NOTE> on his fir&s;t appearance, was dreaded by the
Scots, as an in&s;trument employed by England for the
&s;ubjection of the kingdom, this deed confirmed all their
&s;u&s;picions, and rendered him the object of univer&s;al ha|tred.
Whatever &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions they might be obliged to
make, they con&s;idered him, not as their prince, but as
the delegate and confederate of their determined enemy;
and neither the manners of the age; nor the &s;tate of
Edward's revenue permitting him to maintain a con|&s;tant
&s;tanding army in Scotland, the Engli&s;h forces were
no &s;ooner withdrawn, than the Scots revolted again&s;t
Baliol, and returned to their former allegiance under
Bruce. Sir Andrew Murray, appointed regent by the
<PB N="401" REF="430">
party of this latter prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1335.</NOTE> employed with &s;ucce&s;s his
valour and activity in many &s;mall but deci&s;ive actions
again&s;t Baliol; and in a &s;hort time had almo&s;t wholly
expelled him the kingdom. Edward was obliged again
to a&s;&s;emble an army and to march into Scotland:
The Scots, taught by experience, withdrew into their
hills and fa&s;tne&s;&s;es: He de&s;troyed the hou&s;es, and ravaged
the e&s;tates of tho&s;e whom he called rebels: But this con|firmed
them &s;till farther in their ob&s;tinate antipathy to
England and to Baliol; and being now rendered de&s;pe|rate,
they were ready to take advantage, on the fir&s;t op|portunity,
of the retreat of their enemy, and they &s;oon
re-conquered their country from the Engli&s;h.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1336.</NOTE> Edward
made anew his appearance in Scotland with like &s;ucce&s;s:
He found every thing ho&s;tile in the kingdom, except the
&s;pot on which he was encamped: And tho' he marched
uncontrouled over all the low countries, the nation it&s;elf
was farther than ever from being broken and &s;ubdued.
Be&s;ides being &s;upported by their pride and anger, pa&s;|&s;ions
difficult to tame, they were encouraged, amid&s;t all
their calamities, by daily promi&s;es of relief from France;
and as a war was now likely to break out between that
kingdom and England, they had rea&s;on to expect from
this incident a great diver&s;ion of that force, which had
&s;o long oppre&s;&s;ed and overwhelmed them.</P>
<P>WE now come to a tran&s;action,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1337.</NOTE> on which depended
the mo&s;t memorable events,<NOTE PLACE="marg">King's claim to the crown of France.</NOTE> not only of this long and
active reign, but of the whole Engli&s;h and French hi&s;|tory,
during more than a century; and it will therefore
be nece&s;&s;ary to give a particular account of the &s;prings
and cau&s;es of it. It had long been a prevailing opinion
that the crown of France could never de&s;cend to females;
and as nations, in accounting for principles, which they
regard as fundamental and as peculiar to them&s;elves,
are fond of grounding them rather on primary laws,
<PB N="402" REF="431">
than on blind cu&s;tom, it had been u&s;ual to derive this
maxim from a, clau&s;e in the Salian Code, the law of
an antient tribe among the Franks; tho' that clau&s;e,
when &s;trictly examined, carries only the appearance of
favouring this principle, and does not really, by the
confe&s;&s;ion of the be&s;t critics, bear the &s;en&s;e commonly
impo&s;ed upon it. But tho' po&s;itive law &s;eems wanting
among the French for the exclu&s;ion of females, the
practice had prevailed; and the rule was e&s;tabli&s;hed be|yond
controver&s;y on &s;ome antient as well as &s;ome mo|dern
precedents. During the fir&s;t race of the monarchy,
the Franks were &s;o rude and barbarous a people, that
they were incapable of &s;ubmitting to a female reign;
and in that period of their history, there were frequent
in&s;tances of kings advanced to royalty in prejudice of
females, who were related to the crown by nearer de|grees
of con&s;anguinity. The&s;e precedents, joined to
like cau&s;es, had al&s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed the male &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in
the &s;econd races; and tho' the in&s;tances were neither &s;o
frequent nor &s;o certain during that period, the principle
of excluding the female line &s;eems still to have prevailed,
and to have directed the conduct of the nation. During
the third race, the crown had de&s;cended from father to
&s;on for eleven generations, from Hugh Capet to Lewis
Hutin; and thus, in fact, during the cour&s;e of nine
hundred years, the French monarchy had always been
governed by males, and no female and none de&s;cended
of females had ever mounted the throne. Philip the Fair,
father of Lewis Hutin, left three &s;ons, this Lewis, Phi|lip
the Long, and Charles the Fair, and one daughter,
I&s;abella, queen of England. Lewis Hutin, the elde&s;t,
left at his death one daughter, by Margaret &s;i&s;ter to
Eudes, duke of Burgundy; and as his queen was then
pregnant, Philip, his younger brother, was appointed
regent, till it should appear whether the child &s;hould
<PB N="403" REF="432">
prove a &s;on or a daughter. Her i&s;&s;ue proved male, but
lived only a few days: Philip was proclaimed King:
And as the duke of Burgundy made &s;ome oppo&s;ition,
and a&s;&s;erted the rights of his niece, the &s;tates of the
kingdom, by a &s;olemn and deliberate decree, gave her
the exclu&s;ion, and declared all females for ever incapable
of &s;ucceeding to the crown of France. Philip died
after a &s;hort reign, leaving three daughters; and his
brother, Charles, without di&s;pute or controver&s;y, then
&s;ucceeded to the crown. The reign of Charles was
al&s;o short: He left one daughter; but as his queen
was pregnant, the next male heir was appointed regent,
with a declared right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, if the i&s;&s;ue &s;hould
prove female. This prince was Philip de Valois, cou&s;in
german to the decea&s;ed King; being the &s;on of Charles
de Valois, brother of Philip the Fair. The queen of
France was delivered of a daughter: The regency
ended; and Philip de Valois was unanimou&s;ly placed on
the throne of France.</P>
<P>THE King of England, who was at that time a youth
of fifteen years of age, embraced a notion, that he was
intitled, in right of his mother, to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the
kingdom, and that the claim of the nephew was prefer|able
to that of the cou&s;in german. There could not
well be conceived a notion weaker or wor&s;e grounded.
The principle of excluding females was of old an e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
opinion in France, and had acquired equal au|thority
with the mo&s;t expre&s;s and po&s;itive law: It was
&s;upported by antient precedents: It was confirmed by
recent in&s;tances, &s;olemnly and deliberately decided: And
what placed it &s;till farther beyond controver&s;y; if Ed|ward
was di&s;po&s;ed to que&s;tion its validity, he thereby cut
off his own preten&s;ions; &s;ince the three la&s;t Kings had
all left daughters, who were &s;till alive, and who &s;tood
before him in the order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. He was there|fore
reduced to a&s;&s;ert, that, tho' his mother, I&s;abella,
<PB N="404" REF="433">
was, on account of her &s;ex, incapable of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, he
him&s;elf, who inherited thro' her, was liable to no &s;uch
objection, and might claim by the right of propinquity.
But, be&s;ides that this preten&s;ion was more favourable to
Charles, King of Navarre, de&s;cended from the daughter
of Lewis Hutin, it was &s;o contrary to the e&s;tabli&s;hed
principles of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in every country of Europe<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 4.</NOTE>,
was &s;o repugnant to the practice both in private and
public inheritances, that no body in France thought of
Edward's right: Philip's title was univer&s;ally recog|nized
and acknowledged<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 2$.</NOTE>: And he never imagined,
that he had a competitor; much le&s;s, &s;o formidable a
one as the King of England.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the youthful and ambitious mind of Edward
had ra&s;hly entertained this notion, he did not think pro|per
to in&s;i&s;t on his preten&s;ions, which mu&s;t have imme|diately
involved him, on very unequal terms, in a dan|gerous
and implacable war with &s;o powerful a monarch.
Philip was a prince of mature years, of great expe|rience,
and at that time of an e&s;tabli&s;hed character both
for prudence and valour; and by the&s;e circum&s;tances,
as well as by the union of his people, and their ac|quie&s;cence
in his undoubted right, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed every ad|vantage
over a raw youth, newly rai&s;ed, by inju&s;tice and
violence, to the government of the mo&s;t intractable and
mo&s;t turbulent &s;ubjects in Europe. But there immedi|ately
occurred an incident, which required, that Ed|ward
&s;hould either openly declare his preten&s;ions, or for
ever renounce and abjure them. He was &s;ummoned to
do homage for Guienne: Philip was preparing to com|pel
him by force of arms: That country was in a very
bad &s;tate of defence: And the forfeiture of &s;o rich an
inheritance was, by the feudal law, the immediate con|&s;equence
<PB N="405" REF="434">
of his refu&s;ing or declining to perform the duty
of a va&s;&s;al. Edward therefore thought it prudent to
&s;ubmit to pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ity: He went over to Amiens:
Did homage to Philip: And as there had ari&s;en &s;ome
controver&s;y concerning the terms of this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, he
afterwards &s;ent over a formal deed, in which he acknow|ledged
that he owed liege homage to France<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iv. p. 477, 481. Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 25. Anon. Hi&s;t. p. 394. Wal&s;ingham, p. 130. Murimuth, p. 73.</NOTE>; which
was in effect ratifying, and that in the &s;tronge&s;t terms,
Philip's title to the crown of that kingdom. His own
claim indeed was &s;o unrea&s;onable, and &s;o thoroughly dis|avowed
by the whole French nation, that to in&s;i&s;t on it
was no better than to pretend to the entire conquer of
the kingdom; and it is probable that he would never
have farther thought of it, had it not been for &s;ome inci|dents,
which excited an animo&s;ity between the two monarchs.</P>
<P>ROBERT D'ARTOIS was de&s;cended of the royal blood
of France, was a man of great character and authority,
had e&s;pou&s;ed Philip's &s;i&s;ter, and by his birth, talents,
and credit was entitled to make the highe&s;t figure, and
to fill the mo&s;t important offices, in the monarchy.
This prince had lo&s;t the county of Artois, which he
claimed as his birthright, by a &s;entence, commonly
deemed iniquitous, of Philip the Fair; and he was
&s;educed to attempt the recovering po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by an
action, &s;o unworthy of his rank and character as a forgery<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv, 1. Chap. 29.</NOTE>. The detection of this crime covered him
with &s;hame and confu&s;ion: His brother-in-law not only
abandoned him, but pro&s;ecuted him with violence:
Robert, incapable of bearing di&s;grace, left the kingdom,
and hid him&s;elf in the Low Countries: Being chaced
from that retreat, by the authority of Philip, he came
<PB N="406" REF="435">
over to England; in &s;pite of the French King's me|naces
and remon&s;trances, he was favourably received by
Edward<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iv. p. 747. Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 27.</NOTE>; and was &s;oon admitted into the councils and
&s;hared the confidence of that monarch. Abandoning
him&s;elf to all the movements of rage and de&s;pair, he en|deavoured
to revive the prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions entertained by
Edward in favour of his title to the crown of France,
and even flattered him, that it was not impo&s;&s;ible for a
prince of his valour and abilities, to render his claim ef|fectual.
The King was the more di&s;po&s;ed to hearken
to &s;ugge&s;tions of this nature, becau&s;e he had, in &s;everal
particulars, complaints again&s;t Philip's conduct with re|gard
to Guienne, and becau&s;e that prince had both given
protection to the exiled David Bruce, and &s;upported, or
at lean encouraged the Scots in their &s;truggles for inde|pendancy.
Thus re&s;entment gradually filled the brea&s;ts
of both the monarchs, and made them incapable of
hearkening to any terms of accommodation, propo&s;ed by
the Pope, who never cea&s;ed interpo&s;ing his good offices
between them. Philip thought, that he would be
wanting to the fir&s;t principles of policy, if he abandoned
Scotland: Edward pretended, that he mu&s;t relinqui&s;h all
preten&s;ions to genero&s;ity, if he withdrew his protection
from Robert d'Artois. The former, informed of &s;ome
preparations for ho&s;tilities, which had been made by his
rival, i&s;&s;ued a &s;entence of felony and forfeiture again&s;t
Robert d'Artois, and declared, that every va&s;&s;al of the
crown, whether <HI>within</HI> or <HI>without</HI> the kingdom, who
gave countenance to that traitor, was involved in the &s;ame
&s;entence; a menace ea&s;y to be under&s;tood: The latter,
re&s;olute not to yield, endeavoured to form alliances in
the Low Countries and on the frontiers of Germany,
the only places from which he either could make an ef|fectual
attack upon France, or produce &s;uch a diver&s;ion
<PB N="407" REF="436">
as might &s;ave the province of Guienne, which lay &s;o
much expo&s;ed to the power of Philip.</P>
<P>THE King began with opening his intentions to the
count of Hainault,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prepara|tions for war with France.</NOTE> his father-in-law; and having en|gaged
him in his intere&s;ts, he employed the good offices
and councils of that prince in drawing into his alliance
the other &s;overeigns of that neighbourhood. The duke
of Brabant was induced, by his mediation, and by large
remittances of money from England, to promi&s;e his
concurrence<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iv. p. 777.</NOTE>: The archbi&s;hop of Cologn, the duke of
Guelders, the marquis of Juliers, the count of Namur,
the lords of Fauquemont and Baquen, were engaged by
like motives to embrace the Engli&s;h alliance<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 4. chap. 29, 33, 36.</NOTE>. The&s;e
&s;overeigns could &s;upply, either from their own &s;tates or
from the bordering countries, great numbers of warlike
troops; and nought was wanting to make the force on
that quarter very formidable but the acce&s;&s;ion of
Flanders; which Edward procured by means &s;omewhat
extraordinary and unu&s;ual.</P>
<P>AS the Flemings were the fir&s;t people in the northern
parts of Europe, who cultivated arts and manufactures,
the lower ranks of men in that province had ri&s;en to a de|gree
of riches unknown el&s;ewhere to tho&s;e of their &s;ta|tion

or rather of &s;lavery, into which the common peo|ple
had been univer&s;ally thrown by the feudal in&s;titu|tions.
It was probably difficult for them to bring their
&s;overeign and their nobility to conform them&s;elves to the
principles of law and civil government, &s;o much ne|glected
in every other country: It was impo&s;&s;ible for them
to confine them&s;elves within the proper bounds in their

<P>THEIR pre&s;ent leader was James d' Arteville, a brewer
in Ghent, who governed them with a more ab&s;olute
&s;way than ever had been a&s;&s;umed by any of their lawful
&s;overeigns: He placed and di&s;placed the magi&s;trates at
his plea&s;ure: He was accompanied with a guard, who on

who happened to fall under his di&s;plea&s;ure: All the cities
of Flanders were full of his &s;pies; and it was immedi|ate
death to give him the &s;malle&s;t umbrage: The few
nobles, who remained in the country, lived in continual
terror of his violence: He &s;eized the e&s;tates of all tho&s;e
whom he had either bani&s;hed or murdered; and be&s;tow|ing
a part on their wives and children, converted the re|mainder
to his own u&s;e<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 30.</NOTE>. Such were the fir&s;t effects,
which Europe &s;aw, of popular violence; after having
groaned, during &s;o many centuries, under monarchical
and ari&s;tocratical tyranny.</P>
<P>JAMES D' ARTEVILLE was the man, to whom Edward
applied him&s;elf for bringing over the Flemings to his in|tere&s;t;
and that prince, the mo&s;t haughty and mo&s;t a&s;|piring
of his age, never courted any ally with &s;o much
a&s;&s;iduity and &s;o many &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions, as he employed to|wards
this &s;editions and criminal mechanic. D'Arteville,
proud of the&s;e advances from the King of England, and
&s;en&s;ible, that the Flemings were naturally inclined to
<PB N="409" REF="438">
maintain connexions with the Engli&s;h, who furni&s;hed
them the materials of their woollen manufactures, the
chief &s;ource of their opulence, readily embraced the in|tere&s;ts
of Edward, and invited him over into the Low
Countries. Edward, before he entered on this great en|terprize,
affected to con&s;ult his parliament, a&s;ked their
advice, and obtained their con&s;ent<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Cotton's Abridg.</NOTE>. And the more
to &s;trengthen his hands, he obtained from them a grant
of 20,000 &s;acks of wool; which might amount to
above a hundred thou&s;and pounds: This wool was a
good in&s;trument to employ, with the Fleming; and the
price of it with his German allies. He compleated the
other nece&s;&s;ary &s;ums by loans, by pawning the crown
jewels, by confi&s;cating or rather robbing at once all the
Lombards, who now exerci&s;ed the invidious trade, for|merly
monopolized by the Jews, of lending on intere&s;t<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Dugd. Baron. vol. ii. p. 146.</NOTE>;
and being attended with a body of Engli&s;h forces, and
with &s;everal of his nobility, he &s;ailed over into Flanders.</P>
<P>THE German princes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1338.</NOTE> in order to ju&s;tify their unpro|voked
ho&s;tilities again&s;t France, had required the &s;anc|tion
of &s;ome legal authority; and Edward, that he
might give them &s;atisfaction on this head, had applied
to Lewis of Bavaria, then emperor, and had been
created by him <HI>vicar of the empire;</HI> an empty title, but
which &s;eemed to give him a right of commanding the
&s;ervice of the princes of Germany<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1, chap. 35.</NOTE>. The Flemings,
who were va&s;&s;als of France, pretending like &s;cruples
with regard to the inva&s;ion of their liege lord; Edward,
by the advice of d'Arteville, a&s;&s;umed, in his commi&s;|&s;ions,
the title of King of France, and, by virtue of
this right, challenged their a&s;&s;i&s;tance for dethroning Philip
de Valois, the u&s;urper of his kingdom<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Heming, p. 303. Wal|&s;ingham, p. 143.</NOTE>. This &s;tep,
<PB N="410" REF="439">
which, he feared, would de&s;troy all future amity between
the kingdoms, and beget endle&s;s and implacable jealou|&s;ies
in France, was not taken by him without much re|luctance
and he&s;itation: And as it was not in it&s;elf very
ju&s;tifiable, it was in the i&s;&s;ue attended with many mi&s;e|ries
to both nations. From this period we may date the
commencement of that great animo&s;ity, which the Eng|li&s;h
have ever &s;ince borne to the French, which has
&s;o vi&s;ible an influence on all future tran&s;actions, and
which has been, and continues to be the &s;pring of many
ra&s;h and precipitate re&s;olutions among them. In all
the preceding reigns &s;ince the conque&s;t, the ho&s;tilities
between the two crowns had been only ca&s;ual and tem|porary;
and never being attended with any bloody or
dangerous events, the traces of them were ea&s;ily oblite|rated
by the fir&s;t treaty of pacification. The Engli&s;h
nobility and gentry valued them&s;elves on their French or
Norman extraction: They affected to employ the lan|guage
of that country in all public tran&s;actions, and
even in familiar conver&s;ation: And as both the Engli&s;h
court and camp were always full of nobles, who came
from &s;ome province or other of France, the two people
were during &s;everal centuries more intermingled together
than any two di&s;tinct nations, whom we meet with in
hi&s;tory. But the fatal preten&s;ions of Edward III. di&s;|&s;olved
all the&s;e connexions, and left the &s;eeds of great
animo&s;ity in both countries, e&s;pecially among the Eng|li&s;h.
For it is remarkable, that this latter nation, tho'
they were commonly the aggre&s;&s;ors, and by their &s;uc|ce&s;s
and &s;ituation were enabled to commit the mo&s;t cruel
injuries on the other, have always retained a &s;tronger
tincture of national antipathy; nor is their hatred reta|liated
on them to an equal degree by the French. That
country lies in the middle of Europe, has been &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively
engaged in ho&s;tilities with all its neighbours, the
<PB N="411" REF="440">
popular prejudices have been diverted into many channels,
and, among a people of &s;ofter manners, they never ro&s;e
to a great height again&s;t any particular nation.</P>
<P>PHILIP made great preparations again&s;t the attack of
the Engli&s;h, and &s;uch as &s;eemed more than &s;ufficient
to &s;ecure him from the danger. Be&s;ides the concurrence of
all the nobility in his own populous and warlike king|dom,
his foreign alliances were both more cordial and
powerful than tho&s;e which were formed by his antago|ni&s;t.
The Pope, who, at this time, lived in Avignon,
was dependant on France, and being di&s;gu&s;ted at the
connexions between Edward and Lewis of Bavaria,
whom he had excommunicated, he embraced with zeal
and &s;incerity the cau&s;e of the French monarch. The
King of Navarre, the duke of Brittany, the count de
Bar were in the &s;ame intere&s;ts; and on the &s;ide of Ger|many,
the King of Bohemia, the palatine, the dukes of
Lorraine and Au&s;tria, the bi&s;hop of Liege, the counts
de Deuxpont, Vaudemont, and Geneva. The allies of
Edward were in them&s;elves weaker; and having no
other object, but his money, which began to be ex|hau&s;ted,
they were very &s;low in their motions and very
ire&s;olute in their mea&s;ures.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1339.</NOTE> The duke of Brabant, the
mo&s;t powerful among them, &s;eemed even inclined to
withdraw him&s;elf wholly from the alliance; and the
King was nece&s;&s;itated, both to give the Brabanters new
privileges in trade, and to contract his &s;on Edward with
the daughter of that prince, ere he could bring him to
fulfil his engagements. The &s;ummer was wa&s;ted in
conferences and negotiations before Edward could lead
his armies into the field; and he was obliged, in order
to allure his German allies into his mea&s;ures, to pretend
that the fir&s;t attack &s;hould be made upon Cambray, a
city of the empire which had been garri&s;oned by Philip<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv, 1. chap. 39. Heming. p. 305.</NOTE>.
<PB N="412" REF="441">
But finding by a nearer in&s;pection the difficulty of the
enterprize upon this place, he conducted them towards
the frontiers of France; and he there found, by a &s;en|&s;ible
proof, the vanity of his expectations: The count de
Namur, and even the count de Hainault, his brother-in-law
(for the old count was dead) refu&s;ed to commence
ho&s;tilities again&s;t their liege lord, and retired with all
their troops<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 39.</NOTE>. So little account did they make of Ed|ward's
preten&s;ions to the crown of France!</P>
<P>THE King however entered the enemy's country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with France.</NOTE>
and encamped on the fields of Vironfo&s;&s;e near Capelle,
with an army of near 50,000 men, compo&s;ed almo&s;t en|tirely
of foreigners. Philip came within &s;ight of him
with an army of near double his force, compo&s;ed chiefly
of native &s;ubjects; and it was daily expected that a battle
would have en&s;ued. But the Engli&s;h monarch was
aver&s;e to engage again&s;t &s;o great an inequality: The
French thought it &s;ufficient if he eluded the attacks of
his enemy, without running any unnece&s;&s;ary hazard.
The two armies faced one another for &s;ome days: Mu|tual
defiances were &s;ent: And Edward, at la&s;t, retired
backwards into Flanders, and di&s;per&s;ed his army<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 41, 42, 43. Heming. p. 307. Wal&s;ing. p. 143.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SUCH was the fruitle&s;s and almo&s;t ridiculous conclu|&s;ion
of all Edward's mighty preparations; and as his
mea&s;ures were the mo&s;t prudent, that could be embraced
in his &s;ituation, he might learn from experience in what
a hopele&s;s enterprize he was engaged. His expences,
though they had led to no end, had been con&s;uming and
de&s;tructive: He had contracted near 300,000 pounds of
debt<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Cotton's Abridg. p. 17.</NOTE>; he had anticipated all his revenue; he had pawned
every thing of value, which belonged either to him&s;elf or
<PB N="413" REF="442">
his queen; he was obliged in &s;ome mea&s;ure even to pawn
him&s;elf to his creditors, by de&s;iring their permi&s;&s;ion to go
over to England, in order to procure &s;upply, and by
promi&s;ing on his word of honour to return in per&s;on, if
he did not remit them their money.</P>
<P>BUT he was a prince of too much &s;pirit to be di&s;cou|raged
by the fir&s;t difficulties of an undertaking; and he
was anxious to retrieve his honour by more &s;ucce&s;sful
and more gallant enterprizes. For this purpo&s;e, he had,
during the cour&s;e of the campaign, &s;ent orders to &s;um|mon
a parliament by his &s;on Edward, whom he had left
with the title of guardian, and to demand of them &s;ome
&s;upply in his urgent nece&s;&s;ities. The barons &s;eemed in|clined
to grant his reque&s;t; but the knights, who often,
at this time, acted as a &s;eparate body from the burge&s;&s;es,
made &s;ome &s;cruple of taxing their con&s;tituents, without
a&s;king their con&s;ent; and they de&s;ired the guardian to
&s;ummon a new parliament, who might be properly em|powered
for that purpo&s;e. The &s;ituation of the King
and parliament was, for the time, nearly &s;imilar to that
which they con&s;tantly fell into about the beginning of
the la&s;t century; and &s;imilar con&s;equences began vi&s;ibly
to appear. The King, &s;en&s;ible of the frequent demands
which he would be obliged to make on his people, had
been anxious to en&s;ure to his friends a &s;eat in the hou&s;e
of commons, and at his in&s;tigation, the &s;heriffs and other
placemen had made intere&s;t to be elected into that a&s;&s;em|bly;
an abu&s;e which the knights de&s;ired the King to
correct by the tenor of his writ of &s;ummons, and which
was accordingly remedied. On the other hand, the
knights profe&s;&s;edly annexed conditions to their intended
grant, and required a con&s;iderable retrenchment of the
royal prerogatives, particularly with regard to purvey|ance,
and the levying the antient feudal aids for knight|ing
the King's elde&s;t &s;on, and marrying his elde&s;t daugh|ter.
<PB N="414" REF="443">
The new parliament, called by the guardian,
retained the &s;ame free &s;pirit; and tho' they offered a
large &s;upply of 30,000 &s;acks of wool, no bu&s;ine&s;&s; was
concluded; becau&s;e the conditions, which they annexed,
appeared too high to be compen&s;ated by a temporary
conce&s;&s;ion. But when Edward him&s;elf came over to
England, he &s;ummoned another parliament, and he had
the intere&s;t to procure a &s;upply on more moderate terms.
A confirmation of the two charters and of the privileges
of boroughs, a pardon for old debts and tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, and a
remedy for &s;ome abu&s;es in the execution of common
law, were the chief conditions in&s;i&s;ted on; and the King
in return for his conce&s;&s;ions on the&s;e heads, obtained
from the barons and knights an unu&s;ual grant for two
years of the ninth &s;heaf, lamb, and fleece on their
e&s;tates, and from the burge&s;&s;es, a ninth of their move|ables
at their true value. The whole parliament al&s;o
granted a duty of forty &s;hillings on each &s;ack of wool
exported, on each three hundred wool-fells, and on each
la&s;t of leather for the &s;ame term of years; but dreading
the arbitrary &s;pirit of the crown, they expre&s;sly declared,
that this grant was to continue no longer, and was not
to be drawn into precedent. Being &s;oon after &s;en&s;ible,
that this &s;upply, tho' con&s;iderable and very unu&s;ual in
that age, would come in &s;lowly, and would not an&s;wer
the King's urgent nece&s;&s;ities, both from his pa&s;t debts,
and his preparations for war; they agreed, that 20,000
&s;acks of wool &s;hould immediately be granted him, and
their value be deducted from the ninths, which were
afterwards to be levied.</P>
<P>BUT there appeared, at this time, another jealou&s;y in
the parliament, which was very rea&s;onable, and was
founded on a &s;entiment that ought to have engaged them
rather to check than &s;upport the King in all tho&s;e ambi|tious
projects, &s;o little likely to prove &s;ucce&s;sful, and &s;o
<PB N="415" REF="444">
dangerous to the nation, if they did. Edward, who,
before the commencement of the former campaign, had,
in &s;everal commi&s;&s;ions, a&s;&s;umed the title of King of
France, now more openly, in all public deeds, gave
him&s;elf that appellation, and always quartered the arms
of France with tho&s;e of England in his &s;eals and en&s;igns.
The parliament thought proper to obviate the con&s;e|quences
of this mea&s;ure, and to declare, that they owed
him no obedience as King of France, and that the two
kingdoms mu&s;t forever remain di&s;tinct and independent<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">14 Edward III.</NOTE>.
They undoubtedly fore&s;aw, that France, if &s;ubdued,
would in the end prove the &s;eat of government; and they
deemed this previous prote&s;tation nece&s;&s;ary, in order to
prevent their becoming a province under that monarchy.
A very frail &s;ecurity, if the event had really taken
place!</P>
<P>AS Philip was apprized,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1340.</NOTE> from the preparations, which
were making both in England and the Low Countries,
that he mu&s;t expect another inva&s;ion from Edward, he
fitted out a great fleet of 400 ve&s;&s;els,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Naval vic|tory. 13th June.</NOTE> manned with 40,000
men; and he &s;tationed them off Slui&s;e, with a view of
intercepting the King in his pa&s;&s;age. The Engli&s;h
navy was much inferior in number, con&s;i&s;ting only of
240 &s;hips; but whether it was by the &s;uperior abilities
of Edward, or the greater dexterity of his &s;eamen, they
gained the wind of the enemy, and had the &s;un in their
backs; and with the&s;e advantages began the action.
The battle was fierce and bloody: The Engli&s;h archers,
who&s;e force and addre&s;s were now much celebrated,
galled the French on their approach: And when the
&s;hips grappled together, and the conte&s;t became more
&s;teady and furious, the example of the King, and of &s;o
many gallant nobles, who accompanied him, animated
<PB N="416" REF="445">
to &s;uch a degree the &s;eamen and &s;oldiery, that they main|tained
every where a &s;uperiority over the enemy. The
French al&s;o had been guilty of &s;ome imprudence in &s;tation|ing
them&s;elves &s;o near the coa&s;t of Flanders, and choo&s;ing
that place for the &s;cene of action. The Flemings de|&s;crying
the battle, hurried out of their ports, and brought
a re-inforcement to the Engli&s;h; which, coming unex|pectedly,
had a greater effect than in proportion to its
power and numbers. Two hundred and thirty French
&s;hips were taken: Thirty thou&s;and Frenchmen were
killed, with two of their admirals: The lo&s;s of the Eng|li&s;h
was incon&s;iderable, compared to the greatne&s;s and
importance of the victory<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 51. Ave&s;bury. p. 56. Heming. p. 321.</NOTE>. None of Philip's courtiers,
it is &s;aid, dared to inform him of the event; till his fool
or je&s;ter gave him a hint, by which he di&s;covered the
lo&s;s that he had &s;u&s;tained<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing. p. 148.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE lu&s;tre of this great &s;ucce&s;s added to the King's
authority among his allies, who a&s;&s;embled their forces
with expedition, and joined the Engli&s;h army. Edward
marched to the frontiers of France at the head of above
100,000 men, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of foreigners a more
numerous army than, either before or &s;ince, has ever
been commanded by any King of England<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. v. p. 197.</NOTE>. At the
&s;ame time, the Flemings, to the amount of 50,000 men,
marched out under the command of Robert d'Artois, and
laid &s;iege to St. Omer; but this tumultuary force, com|po&s;ed
entirely of trade&s;men, unexperienced in war, was
routed by a &s;ally of the garri&s;on, and notwith&s;tanding
the abilities of their leader, was thrown into &s;uch a
panic, that they were in&s;tantly di&s;per&s;ed, and never after
appeared in the field. The enterprizes of Edward, tho'
not attended with &s;o inglorious an i&s;&s;ue, proved equally
vain and fruitle&s;s. The King of France had a&s;&s;embled
<PB N="417" REF="446">
an army more numerous than the Engli&s;h; was accom|panied
with all the chief nobility of his kingdom; was
attended by many foreign princes, and even by three
monarchs, the Kings of Bohemia, Scotland and Na|varre<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 57.</NOTE>:
Yet he &s;till adhered to the prudent re&s;olution
of putting nothing to hazard, and after throwing &s;trong
garri&s;ons into all the frontier towns, he retired back|wards,
per&s;uaded, that the enemy, having wa&s;ted their
force in &s;ome tedious and un&s;ucce&s;sful enterprize, would
afford him an ea&s;y victory.</P>
<P>TOURNAY was at that time one of the mo&s;t con&s;idera|ble
cities of Flanders, containing above 60,000 inhabi|tants
of all ages, who were affectionate to the French
government; and as the &s;ecret of Edward's de&s;igns had
not been &s;trictly kept, Philip learned, that the Engli&s;h,
in order to gratify their Flemi&s;h allies, had intended to
open the campaign with the &s;iege of this place: He took
care therefore to &s;upply it with a garri&s;on of 14,000
men, commanded by the brave&s;t nobility of France;
and he rea&s;onably expected, that the&s;e forces, joined to
the inhabitants, would be able to defend the city again&s;t
all the efforts of the enemy. Accordingly, Edward,
when he commenced the &s;iege, about the end of July,
found every where an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance: The valour
of the one &s;ide was encountered with equal valour by the
other: Every a&s;&s;ault was repul&s;ed and proved un&s;ucce&s;s|ful:
And the King was at la&s;t obliged to turn the &s;iege
into a blockade, in hopes, that the great numbers of the
garri&s;on and inhabitants, which had enabled them to de|&s;end
them&s;elves again&s;t his attacks, would but expo&s;e
them to be the more ea&s;ily reduced by famine<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv, 1. chap. 54.</NOTE>. The
count d'Eu, the governor, as &s;oon as he perceived that
the Engli&s;h had formed this plan of operations, endea|voured
<PB N="418" REF="447">
to &s;pare his provi&s;ions, by expelling all the u&s;ele&s;s
mouths; and the duke of Brabant, who wi&s;hed no &s;uc|ce&s;s
to Edward's enterprise, gave every one a free pa&s;&s;age
thro' his quarters.</P>
<P>AFTER the &s;iege had continued ten weeks, the city
was reduced to di&s;tre&s;s; and Philip, recalling all his &s;cat|tered
garri&s;ons, advanced at the head of a mighty army,
within three leagues of the Engli&s;h camp, with an inten|tion
of &s;till avoiding any deci&s;ive action, but of &s;eeking
&s;ome opportunity to throw relief into the place. Here,
Edward, irritated with the &s;mall progre&s;s which he had
hitherto made, and with the di&s;agreeable pro&s;pect that
lay before him, &s;ent Philip a defiance by a herald; and
challenged him to decide their claims for the crown of
France, either by &s;ingle combat, or by an action of a
hundred again&s;t a hundred, or by a general engagement.
But Philip replied, that Edward having done homage to
him for his dutchy of Guienne, and having &s;olemnly ac|knowledged
his &s;uperiority, it by no means became him
to &s;end a defiance to his liege lord and &s;overeign: That
he was confident, notwithstanding all his preparations,
and his conjunction with the rebellious Flemings, to be
able &s;oon to chace him from the frontiers of France:
That as Edward's ho&s;tilities had prevented him from ex|ecuting
his purpo&s;ed cru&s;ade again&s;t the infidels, he
tru&s;ted in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Almighty, who would re|ward
his pious intentions, and puni&s;h the aggre&s;&s;or,
who&s;e ill-grounded claims had rendered them ineffectual:
That Edward propo&s;ed a duel on very unequal terms,
and offered to hazard only his own per&s;on, again&s;t both
the kingdom of France, and the per&s;on of the King:
But that if he would encrea&s;e the &s;take, and put al&s;o the
kingdom of England on the i&s;&s;ue of the duel, he would,
notwith&s;tanding that the terms would &s;till be unequal,
<PB N="419" REF="448">
very willingly accept of his challenge<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Du Tillet, Recueil de Traitez, &amp;c. Heming. p. 325, 326. Wal&s;ing. p. 149.</NOTE>. It was ea&s;y to
&s;ee that the&s;e mutual bravades were intended only to
dazle the populace, and that the two kings were too wi&s;e
to think of executing their pretended purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>WHILE the French and Engli&s;h armies lay in this
&s;ituation, and a general action was every day expected,
Jane counte&s;s dowager of Hainault interpo&s;ed with her
good offices, and endeavoured to conciliate peace between
the contending monarchs, and to prevent any farther
effu&s;ion of blood. This prince&s;s was mother-in-law to
Edward, and &s;i&s;ter to Philip; and tho' &s;he had taken the
vows in a convent, and had abandoned the world, &s;he
left her retreat on this occa&s;ion, and employed all her
pious efforts to allay tho&s;e animo&s;ities, which had taken,
place between per&s;ons &s;o nearly related to her, and to
each other. As Philip had no material claims upon his
antagoni&s;t, &s;he found him to hearken very willingly to
the propo&s;als; and even the haughty and ambitious mind
of Edward, convinced of his fruitle&s;s attempt, was not
aver&s;e to her negociation. He was &s;en&s;ible from expe|rience,
that he had engaged in an enterprise which far
exceeded his force; and that the power of England was
never likely to prevail over that of a &s;uperior kingdom,
firmly united under an able and prudent monarch. He
di&s;covered, that all the allies, whom he could gain by
negotiation, were at bottom aver&s;e to his enterprise;
and tho' they might &s;econd it to a certain length, would
immediately detach them&s;elves, and oppo&s;e its final ac|compli&s;hment,
if ever they could be brought to think,
that there was &s;eriou&s;ly any danger of it. He even &s;aw,
that their chief purpo&s;e was to obtain money from him;
and as his &s;upplies from England came in very &s;lowly,
and had much di&s;appointed his expectations, he was con|vinced
<PB N="420" REF="449">
of their growing indifference in his cau&s;e, and of
their zeal to embrace all plau&s;ible terms of accommoda|tion.
Convinced at la&s;t, that an undertaking mu&s;t be
imprudent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3d Septr.</NOTE> which could only be &s;upported by means &s;o
unequal to the end, he concluded a truce, which left
both parties in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their pre&s;ent acqui&s;itions,
and &s;topped all farther ho&s;tilities on the &s;ide of the Low
Countries, Guienne and Scotland, till Mid&s;ummer next<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 64. Ave&s;bury, p. 65.</NOTE>.
A negotiation was &s;oon after opened at Arras, under the
mediation of the Pope's legates, and the truce was at|tempted
to be converted into a &s;olid peace. Edward
here required that Philip &s;hould free Guienne from all
claims of &s;uperiority, and entirely abandon the protection
of Scotland: But as he &s;eemed not any wi&s;e entitled to
make &s;uch exorbitant demands, either from his pa&s;t &s;uc|ee&s;&s;es,
or future pro&s;pects, they were totally rejected by
Philip, who agreed only to a prolongation of the truce.</P>
<P>THE King of France &s;oon after detached the emperor
Lewis from the alliance of England, and engaged him to
revoke the title of imperial vicar, which he had conferred
on Edward<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Heming. p. 352. Ypod. Neu&s;t. p. 514. Knyghton, p. 2580.</NOTE>. The King's other allies on the frontiers
of France, di&s;appointed in their hopes, gradually with|drew
from the confederacy. And Edward him&s;elf, har|ra&s;&s;ed
by his numerous and impatient creditors, was
obliged to make his e&s;cape by &s;tealth into England.</P>
<P>THE unu&s;ual impo&s;ition of a ninth &s;heaf,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dome&s;tic di&s;turban|ces.</NOTE> lamb and
fleece, laid on by the parliament, together with the great
want of money, and &s;till more, of credit in England,
had rendered the remittances to Flanders &s;o backward;
nor could it be expected, that any expeditious methods
of collecting a tax, which was &s;o new in it&s;elf, and
which yielded only a gradual produce, could po&s;&s;ibly be
contrived by the King or his mini&s;ters. And tho' the
<PB N="421" REF="450">
parliament, fore&s;eeing the inconvenience, had granted,
as a pre&s;ent re&s;ource, 20,000 &s;acks of wool, the only
Engli&s;h goods which bore a certain price in foreign mar|kets,
and were the next to ready money; it was impo&s;|&s;ible,
but the &s;eizing of &s;uch a bulky commodity, the
gathering of it from different parts of the kingdom, and
the di&s;po&s;ing of it abroad, mu&s;t take up much more
time than the urgency of the King's affairs would permit,
and occa&s;ion all the di&s;appointments complained of,
during the cour&s;e of the campaign. But tho' nothing
had happened, which Edward might not rea&s;onably have
fore&s;een, he was &s;o irritated with the unfortunate i&s;&s;ue
of his military operations, and &s;o much vexed and af|fronted
by his foreign creditors, that he was determined
to throw the blame &s;omewhere off him&s;elf, and he came
in very bad humour into England. He di&s;covered his
pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition by the fir&s;t act which he performed
after his arrival: As he landed unexpectedly, he found
the Tower &s;omewhat unguarded; and he immediately
committed to pri&s;on the con&s;table and all others who had
the charge of that fortre&s;s; and he treated them with un|u&s;ual
rigour<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ypod. Neu&s;t. p. 513.</NOTE>. His vengeance fell next on the officers
of the revenue, the &s;heriffs, the collectors of taxes, the
undertakers of all kinds; and be&s;ides turning all of them
out of their offices, he appointed commi&s;&s;ioners to en|quire
into their conduct; and the&s;e men, in order to
gratify the King's humour, were &s;ure not to find any
per&s;on innocent, who came before them<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ave&s;bury, p. 70. Heming. p. 326. Wal&s;ingham, p. 150.</NOTE>. Sir John
St. Paul, keeper of the privy &s;eal, Sir John Stonore,
lord chief ju&s;tice, Andrew Aubrey, mayor of London,
were di&s;placed and impri&s;oned; as were al&s;o the bi&s;hop
of Chiche&s;ter, chancellor, and the bi&s;hop of Lichfield,
trea&s;urer. Stratford, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, on whom
<PB N="422" REF="451">
the charge of collecting the new taxes had been chiefly
laid, &s;ell likewi&s;e under the King's di&s;plea&s;ure; but
being ab&s;ent at the time of Edward's fir&s;t arrival, he
e&s;caped feeling the immediate effects of it.</P>
<P>THERE were &s;trong rea&s;ons, which might di&s;courage
the Kings of England, in tho&s;e ages, from be&s;towing
the chief offices of the crown on prelates and other eccle|&s;ia&s;tical
per&s;ons. The&s;e men had &s;o entrenched them|&s;elves
in privileges and immunities, and pretended &s;o
openly to be exempt from all &s;ecular juri&s;diction, that
no civil penalty could be inflicted on them for any mal|ver&s;ation
in office; and as even trea&s;on it&s;elf was declared
to be no canonical offence, nor was allowed to be a &s;uf|ficient
rea&s;on for deprivation or other &s;piritual cen&s;ures,
that order of men had en&s;ured to them&s;elves almo&s;t a total
impunity, and were not bound by any political laws or
&s;tatutes. But, on the other hand, there were many pe|culiar
cau&s;es which favoured their promotion. Be&s;ides
that they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed almo&s;t all the learning of the age, and
were be&s;t qualified for civil employments; the prelates
enjoyed equal dignity with the greate&s;t barons, and gave
weight, by their per&s;onal authority, to the powers en|tru&s;ted
with them: While, at the &s;ame time, they en|dangered
not the crown by accumulating wealth or in|fluence
in their families, and were re&s;trained, by the
decency of their character, from that open rapine and
violence, &s;o often practi&s;ed by the nobles. The&s;e mo|tives
had induced Edward, as well as many of his prede|ce&s;&s;ors,
to entru&s;t the chief parts of his government in
the hands of eccle&s;ia&s;tics; at the hazard of &s;eeing them
di&s;own his authority &s;o &s;oon as it was turned again&s;t them.</P>
<P>THIS was the ca&s;e with archbi&s;hop Stratford.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1341.</NOTE> That
prelate, informed of Edward's indignation again&s;t him,
<PB N="423" REF="452">
prepared him&s;elf for the &s;torm; and not content with
&s;tanding upon the defen&s;ive, he re&s;olved, by beginning
the attack, to &s;how the King, that he knew the privi|leges
of his character, and had courage to maintain them.
He i&s;&s;ued a general &s;entence of excommunication again&s;t
all, who, on any pretext, exerci&s;ed violence on the per|&s;on
or goods of clergymen; who infringed tho&s;e privi|leges
&s;ecured by the great charter, and by the eccle&s;ia&s;t|ical
canons; or who accu&s;ed a prelate of trea&s;on or any
other crime, in order to bring him under the King's di&s;|plea&s;ure<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Heming. p. 339. Ang. Sacra, vol. i. p 21, 22. Wal&s;ingham, p. 153.</NOTE>.
Even Edward had rea&s;on to think him&s;elf
&s;truck at by this &s;entence; both on account of the im|pri&s;onment
of the two bi&s;hops and that of other clergy|men
concerned in levying the taxes, and on account of
his &s;eizing their lands and moveables, that he might
make them an&s;werable for any balance, which remained
in their hands. The clergy, with the primate at their
head, were now formed into a regular combination
again&s;t the King; and many calumnies were &s;pread
again&s;t him, in order to deprive him of the confidence
and affections of his people; that he intended to recal
the general pardon, and the remi&s;&s;ion of old debts which
he had granted, and to impo&s;e new and arbitrary taxes
without con&s;ent of parliament. The archbi&s;hop went &s;o
far, in a letter to the King him&s;elf, as to tell him, that
there were two powers, by which the world was go|verned,
the holy pontifical apo&s;tolie dignity, and the
royal &s;ubordinate authority; That of the&s;e two powers,
the clerical was evidently the &s;upreme, &s;ince the prie&s;ts
were to an&s;wer, at the tribunal of the divine judgment,
for the conduct of kings them&s;elves: That the clergy
were the &s;piritual fathers of all the faithful, and among&s;t
<PB N="424" REF="453">
others of kings and princes; and were intitled, by a
heavenly charter, to direct their wills and actions, and
to cen&s;ure their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions: And that prelates had
heretofore cited emperors before their tribunal, had tried
their life and behaviour, and had anathematized them
for their ob&s;tinate offences<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Anglia Sacra, vol. i. p. 27.</NOTE>. The&s;e topics were not
well calculated to appea&s;e Edward's indignation; and
when he called a parliament, he &s;ent not to the primate,
as to the other peers, a &s;ummons to attend it. Strat|ford
was not di&s;couraged with this mark of neglect or
anger: He appeared before the gates, arrayed in his
pontifical robes, holding the cro&s;ier in his hand, and
accompanied with a pompous train of prie&s;ts and pre|lates;
and he required admittance to his &s;eat as the fir&s;t
and highe&s;t peer of the realm. For two days, the King
denied him entrance: But either &s;en&s;ible, that this affair
might be attended with dangerous con&s;equences, or that
in his impatience he had groundle&s;sly accu&s;ed the primate
of malver&s;ation in his office, which &s;eems really to have
been the ca&s;e; he at la&s;t permitted him to take his &s;eat,
and was reconciled to him<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Anglia Sacra, vol. i. p. 38, 39, 40, 41.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>EDWARD now found him&s;elf in a very bad &s;ituation
both with his own people and with foreign &s;tates; and it
required all his genius and capacity to extricate him&s;elf
from &s;uch multiplied difficulties and embarra&s;&s;ments.
His unju&s;t and exorbitant claims on France and Scotland
had engaged him in an implacable war with the&s;e two
kingdoms, his neare&s;t neighbours: He had lo&s;t almo&s;t
all his foreign alliances by his irregular payments: He
was deeply involved in debts, for which he owed a con|&s;uming
intere&s;t: His military operations had vani&s;hed
into &s;moke; and except his naval victory, none of them
<PB N="425" REF="454">
had been attended even with glory or renown, either to
him&s;elf or to the nation: The animo&s;ity between him and
the clergy was open and declared: The people were di&s;|contented
on account of many arbitrary mea&s;ures, in which
he had been engaged: And what was more dangerous,
the nobility, taking advantage of his pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ities,
were determined to retrench his power, and by encroach|ing
on the antient prerogatives of the crown, to acquire
to them&s;elves independance and authority. But the
a&s;piring genius of Edward, which had &s;o far tran&s;ported
him beyond the bounds of di&s;cretion, proved at la&s;t &s;uf|ficient
to re-in&s;tate him in his former authority, and
finally to render his reign the mo&s;t triumphant which is
to be met with in Engli&s;h &s;tory: Tho' for the pre&s;ent he
was obliged, with &s;ome lo&s;s of honour, to yield to the
current, which bore &s;o &s;trongly again&s;t him.</P>
<P>THE parliament framed an act, which was likely to
produce con&s;iderable innovations in the government.
They premi&s;ed, that, whereas the great charter had, to
the manife&s;t peril and &s;lander of the King and damage of
his people, been violated in many points, particularly
by the impri&s;onment of free men and the &s;eizure of
their goods, without &s;uit, indictment or trial, it was
nece&s;&s;ary to confirm it anew, and to oblige all the chief
officers of the law, together with the &s;teward and cham|berlain
of the hou&s;hold, the keeper of the privy &s;eal, the
controller and trea&s;urer of the wardrobe, and tho&s;e who
were entru&s;ted with the education of the young prince,
to &s;wear to the regular ob&s;ervance of it. They al&s;o re|marked,
that the peers of the realm had formerly been
arre&s;ted and impri&s;oned, and di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of their tempo|ralities
and lands, and even &s;ome of them put to death,
without judgment of their peers; and they therefore
enacted that &s;uch violences &s;hould henceforth cea&s;e,
and no peer be puni&s;hed but by the award of his peers
<PB N="426" REF="455">
<HI>in parliament.</HI> They required, that, whenever any of
the great offices abovementioned &s;hould become vacant,
the King &s;hould fill it by the advice of his council, and
the con&s;ent of other great men, who &s;hould at that time
be &s;ound to re&s;ide in the neighbourhood of the court.
And they enacted, that on the third day of every &s;e&s;&s;ion,
the King &s;hould re&s;ume into his own hands all the&s;e
offices, except tho&s;e of ju&s;tices of the two benches and
the barons of exchequer; that the&s;e mini&s;ters &s;hould for
the time be reduced to private per&s;ons; that they &s;hould
in that condition an&s;wer before the parliament to any
accu&s;ations brought again&s;t them; and that, if they
were found any wi&s;e guilty, they &s;hould finally be di&s;|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of their offices, and more &s;ufficient per&s;ons be
&s;ub&s;tituted in their place<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">15 Edw. III.</NOTE>. By the&s;e la&s;t regulations,
the barons approached as near as they dared to tho&s;e
re&s;trictions, which had formerly been impo&s;ed on Hen|ry
III. and Edward II. and which, from the dangerous
con&s;equences attending them, had become &s;o generally
odious, that they did not expect to have either the con|currence
of the people in demanding them, or the a&s;&s;ent
of the pre&s;ent King in granting them.</P>
<P>IN return for the&s;e important conce&s;&s;ions, the parlia|ment
proffered the King a grant of 20,000 &s;acks of wool;
and his wants were &s;o urgent, from the clamours of his
creditors, and the demands of his foreign allies, that he
was obliged to accept of the &s;upply on the&s;e hard condi|tions.
He ratified this &s;tatute in full parliament; but he
<HI>&s;ecretly</HI> entered a prote&s;t of &s;uch a nature as was &s;uffi|cient,
one &s;hould imagine, to de&s;troy for the future all
tru&s;t and confidence with his people: He declared, that,
&s;o &s;oon as his convenience permitted, he would, from
his own authority, revoke what had been extorted from
<PB N="427" REF="456">
him<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Statutes at large, 15 Edw. III. That this prote&s;t of the King's was <HI>secret</HI> appears evidently, &s;ince otherwi&s;e it would have been ridi|culous in the parliament to have accepted of his a&s;&s;ent: Be&s;ides the King owns that he <HI>di&s;&s;embled,</HI> which would not have been the ca&s;e, had his prote&s;t been public.</NOTE>. Accordingly, he was no &s;ooner po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the
parliamentary &s;upply, than he i&s;&s;ued an edict, which
contains many extraordinary po&s;itions and preten&s;ions.
He fir&s;t a&s;&s;erts, that that &s;tatute had been enacted contrary
to the law; as if a free legi&s;lative body could ever do any
thing illegal. He next affirms, that, as it was hurtful
to the prerogatives of the crown which he was &s;worn to
defend, he had only di&s;&s;embled, when he &s;eemed to ratify
it, but that he had never in his own brea&s;t given his
a&s;&s;ent to it. He does not pretend, that either he or the
parliament lay under any force; but only that &s;ome in|convenience
would have en&s;ued had he not &s;eemingly
given his a&s;&s;ent to that pretended &s;tatute. He therefore,
with the advice of his council and of &s;ome earls and ba|rons,
abrogates and annuls it; and tho' he profe&s;&s;es
him&s;elf willing and determined to ob&s;erve &s;uch articles
of it as were formerly law, he declares it to have thence|forth
no force or authority<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Statutes at large, 15 Edw. III.</NOTE>. The parliaments, who
were afterwards a&s;&s;embled, took no notice of this arbi|trary
exertion of royal power, which by a parity of rea&s;on
left all their laws at the mercy of the King; and during
the cour&s;e of two years, Edward had &s;o far re-e&s;tabli&s;hed
his influence, and freed him&s;elf from his pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ities,
that he then obtained from his parliament a legal repeal of
the obnoxious &s;tatute<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Cotton's Abridgm, p. 38, 39.</NOTE>. This tran&s;action certainly con|tains
remarkable circum&s;tances, which di&s;cover the man|ners
and &s;entiments of the age, and may prove what inac|curate
work might be expected from &s;uch rude hands, when
<PB N="428" REF="457">
employed in legi&s;lation, and in rearing the delicate fabric
of laws and a con&s;titution.</P>
<P>BUT tho' Edward had happily recovered his authority
at home, which had been impaired by the events of the
French war, he had undergone &s;o many mortifications
from that attempt, and &s;aw &s;o little pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s,
that he would probably have dropt his claim, had not a
revolution in Brittany opened to him more promi&s;ing
views, and given his enterprizing genius a full opportu|nity
of di&s;playing it&s;elf.</P>
<P>JOHN III.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of Brittany.</NOTE> duke of Brittany, had, &s;ome years before
his death, found him&s;elf declining thro' age and infirmi|ties;
and having no i&s;&s;ue, he was &s;olicitous to prevent
tho&s;e di&s;orders, to which, on the event of his decea&s;e, a
di&s;puted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion might expo&s;e his &s;ubjects. His
younger brother, the count de Penthievre, had left only
one daughter, whom the duke deemed his heir; and as
his family had inherited the dutchy by a female &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion,
he thought her title preferable to that of the count
de Mountfort, who, being his brother by a &s;econd mar|riage,
was the male heir of that principality<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 64.</NOTE>. He ac|cordingly
propo&s;ed to be&s;tow her in marriage on &s;ome
per&s;on, who might be able to defend her rights; and he
ca&s;t his eye on Charles de Blois, nephew of the King of
France, by his mother, Margaret de Valois, &s;i&s;ter to
that monarch. But as he both loved his &s;ubjects and was
beloved by them, he determined not to take this impor|tant
&s;tep without their approbation; and having a&s;&s;em|bled
the &s;tates of Brittany, he repre&s;ented to them the
advantages of that alliance, and the pro&s;pect, which
it gave, of an entire &s;ettlement of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The
Bretons willingly concurred in his choice: The marriage
was concluded: All his va&s;&s;als, and among the re&s;t, the
<PB N="429" REF="458">
count de Mountfort, &s;wore fealty to Charles and to his
&s;pou&s;e as to their future &s;overeigns: And every danger of
civil commotions &s;eemed to be obviated, as far as human
prudence could provide a remedy again&s;t them.</P>
<P>BUT on the death of this good prince the ambition
of the count de Mountfort broke thro' all the&s;e regu|lations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Renewal of the war with France.</NOTE>
and kindled a war, not only dangerous to Brit|tany,
but to a great part of Europe. While Charles de
Blois was &s;oliciting at the court of France the inve&s;titure
of the dutchy, Mountfort was active in acquiring imme|diate
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it; and by force or intrigue he made
him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Rennes, Nantz, Bre&s;t, Hennebonne,
and all the mo&s;t important fortre&s;&s;es, and engaged many
con&s;iderable barons to acknowledge his authority<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1, chap. 65, 66, 67, 68.</NOTE>.
Sen&s;ible, that he could expect no favour from Philip,
he made a voyage to England, on pretence of &s;oliciting
his claim to the earldom of Richmond, which had de|volved
to him by his brother's death; and offering to do
homage to Edward, as King of France, for the dutchy
of Brittany, he propo&s;ed a &s;trict alliance for the &s;upport
of each other's preten&s;ions. Edward &s;aw immediately
the advantages attending this treaty: Mountfort, an
active and valiant prince, clo&s;ely united to him by in|tere&s;t,
opened at once an entrance into the heart of
France, and afforded him much more flattering views,
than his allies on the &s;ide of Germany and the Low
Countries, who had no &s;incere attachment to his cau&s;e,
and who&s;e progre&s;s was al&s;o ob&s;tructed by tho&s;e nume|rous
fortifications, which had been rai&s;ed on that fro|ntier.
Robert d'Artois was zealous in inforcing the&s;e
con&s;iderations: The ambitious &s;pirit of Edward was little
di&s;po&s;ed to fit down under tho&s;e repul&s;es, which he had
received, and which, he thought, had &s;o much injured
<PB N="430" REF="459">
his reputation: And it required a very &s;hort negotiation
to conclude a treaty of alliance between two men; who
tho' their pleas with regard to the preference of male or
female &s;ucce&s;&s;ion were directly oppo&s;ite, were intimately
connected by their common intere&s;ts<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 69.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AS this treaty was &s;till a &s;ecret, Mountfort, on his
return, ventured to appear at Paris, in order to defend
his cau&s;e before the court of peers; but ob&s;erving Philip
and his judges to be prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed again&s;t his title, and
dreading their intentions of arre&s;ting him, till he &s;ould
re&s;tore what he had &s;eized by violence, he &s;uddenly made
his e&s;cape; and war immediately broke out between him
and Charles de Blois<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 70, 71.</NOTE>. Philip &s;ent his elde&s;t &s;on, the
duke of Normandy, with a powerful army to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
of the latter; and Mountfort, unable to keep the field
again&s;t his rival, remained in the city of Nantz, where
he was be&s;ieged. The city was taken by the treachery
of the inhabitants: Mountfort fell into the hands of his
enemies; was conducted as a pri&s;oner to Paris; and was
&s;hut up in the tower of the Louvre<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 73.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS event &s;eemed to put an end to the preten&s;ions of
the count de Mountfort;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1342.</NOTE> but his affairs were immediately
retrieved by an unexpected incident, which in&s;pired new
life and vigour into his party. Jane of Flanders, counte&s;s
of Mountfort, the mo&s;t extraordinary woman of that age,
was rouzed, by the captivity of her hu&s;band, from tho&s;e
dome&s;tic cares, to which the had hitherto limited her
genius; and the courageously undertook to &s;upport the
falling fortunes of her family. No &s;ooner did the receive
the fatal intelligence, than the a&s;&s;embled the inhabitants
of Rennes, where the then re&s;ided; and Carrying her
infant &s;on in her arms, deplored to them the calamity of
<PB N="431" REF="460">
their &s;overeign, and recommended to their care the illu&s;|trious
orphan, the &s;ole male remaining of their antient
princes, who had governed them with &s;uch indulgence
and lenity, and to whom they had ever profe&s;&s;ed &s;uch a
zealous attachment. She declared her&s;elf willing to run
all hazards with them in so ju&s;t a cau&s;e; di&s;covered the re|&s;ources
which &s;till remained in the alliance of England;
and entreated them to make one effort again&s;t an u&s;urper,
who, being impo&s;ed on them by the arms of France,
would in return make a &s;acrifice to his protector of the
antient liberties of Brittany. The audience, moved by
the affecting appearance, and in&s;pirited by the noble con|duct
of the prince&s;s, vowed to live and die with her in
defending the rights of her family: All the other for|tre&s;&s;es
of Brittany embraced the &s;ame re&s;olution: The
counte&s;s went from place to place, encouraging the gar|ri&s;ons,
providing them with every thing nece&s;&s;ary for
&s;ub&s;i&s;tance, and concerting their plans of dedence; and
after me had put the whole province in a proper po&s;ture,
the &s;hut her&s;elf up in Hennebonne, where &s;he waited
with impatience the arrival of tho&s;e fuccours, which
Edward had promi&s;ed her. Mean while, the &s;ent over
her &s;on to England, both that the might put him in a
place of &s;afety, and engage the King more &s;trongly, by
&s;uch a pledge, to embrace with zeal the intere&s;ts of her
family.</P>
<P>CHARLES DE BLOIS, anxious to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter
of &s;o important a fortre&s;s as Hennebonne, and &s;till more
to take the counte&s;s pri&s;oner, from whole vigour and
capacity all the difficulties to his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in Brittany
now proceeded, fat down before the place with a great
army, compo&s;ed of French, Spaniards, Genoe&s;e, and
&s;ome Bretons; and he conducted the attack with indefa|tigable
industry<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv, 1, chap. 81.</NOTE>. The defence was no le&s;s vigorous:
<PB N="432" REF="461">
The be&s;iegers were repul&s;ed in every a&s;&s;ault: Frequent
&s;allies were made with &s;ucce&s;s by the garri&s;on: And the
counte&s;s her&s;elf being the mo&s;t forward in all military
operations, every one was a&s;hamed not to do his duty to
the utmo&s;t in this de&s;perate &s;ituation. One day the per|ceived,
that the be&s;iegers, entirely employed in an at|tack,
had neglected a di&s;tant quarter of their camp; and
the immediately &s;allied forth at the head of a body of
200 cavalry, threw them into confu&s;ion, executed great
&s;laughter upon them, and &s;et fire to their tents, baggage
and magazines: But when the was preparing to return,
the found that the was intercepted, and that a great body
of the enemy had thrown them&s;elves between her and
the gates. She in&s;tantly took her re&s;olution; the ordered
her men to di&s;band, and to make the be&s;t of their way by
&s;light to Bre&s;t, She met them at the appointed place of
rendezvous, collected another body of 500 hor&s;e, re|turned
to Hennebonne, broke unexpectedly thro' the
enemies camp, and was received with &s;houts and accla|mations
by the garri&s;on, who, encouraged by this rein|forcement,
and by &s;o rare an example of female valour,
determined to defend them&s;elves to the la&s;t extremity.</P>
<P>THE reiterated attacks, however, of the be&s;iegers,
had at length made &s;everal breaches in the walls; and
it was apprehended, that a general a&s;&s;ault, which was
every hour expected, would overpower the garri&s;on, di|mini&s;hed
in their numbers, and extremely weakened with
watching and fatigue. It became nece&s;&s;ary to treat of a
capitulation; and the bi&s;hop of Leon was already en|gaged,
for that purpo&s;e, in a conference with Charles
de Blois, when the counte&s;s, who had mounted on a
high tower, and was looking towards the &s;ea with great
impatience, de&s;cried &s;ome &s;ails at a di&s;tance. She im|mediately
exclaimed: <HI>Behold the &s;uccours! the Engli&s;h
<PB N="433" REF="462">
&s;uccours! No capitulation</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 81.</NOTE>! This fleet carried a body of
Engli&s;h gens d'armes, and &s;ix thou&s;and archers, whom
Edward had prepared for the relief of Hennebonne, but
who had been long detained by contrary winds. They
entered the harbour under the command of Sir Walter
Manny, one of the brave&s;t captains of England; and
having in&s;pired fre&s;h courage into the garri&s;on, imme|diately
&s;allied forth, beat the be&s;iegers from all their
po&s;ts, and obliged them to decamp.</P>
<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding this &s;ucce&s;s, the counte&s;s of
Mountfort found that her party, overpowered by &s;upe|rior
numbers, were declining in every quarter; and the
went over to &s;olicit more effectual &s;uccours from the
King of England. Edward granted her a con&s;iderable
reinforcement under Robert d'Artois; who embarked
his troops on board a fleet of forty-five &s;hips, and &s;ailed
to Brittany. He was met in his pa&s;&s;age by the enemy;
an action en&s;ued, where the counte&s;s behaved with her
wonted valour, and charged the enemy &s;word in hand;
but the fleets, after a &s;harp action, were &s;eparated by a
&s;torm, and the Engli&s;h arrived &s;afely in Brittany. The
fir&s;t exploit of Robert d'Artois was the taking of Vanne's,
which he ma&s;tered by conduct and addre&s;s<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 93.</NOTE>: But he &s;ur|vived
a very little time this pro&s;perity. The Breton no|blemen
of the party of Charles a&s;&s;embled &s;ecretly in arms,
attacked Vannes of a &s;udden, and carried the place;
chiefly by rea&s;on of a wound received by Robert d'Ar|tois,
of which he &s;oon after died at &s;ea on his return to
England<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 94.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER the death of this unfortunate prince, the chief
author of all the calamities, with which his country was
overwhelmed for above a century, Edward undertook in
<PB N="434" REF="463">
per&s;on the defence of the counte&s;s of Mountfort; and as
the la&s;t truce with France was now expired, the war,
which the Engli&s;h and French had hitherto carried on
as allies to the competitors for Brittany, is thenceforth
conducted in the name and under the &s;tandard of the
two monarchs. The King landed at Morbian near
Vannes, with an army of 12,000 men; and being ma&s;ter
of the field, where no enemy dared to appear again&s;t
him, he endeavoured to give a lu&s;tre to his arms, by
commencing at once three important &s;ieges, that of Van|nes,
of Rennes, and of Nantz. But by undertaking
too much, he failed of &s;ucce&s;s in all his enterprizes.
Even the &s;iege of Vannes, which Edward in per&s;on con|ducted
with vigour, advanced but &s;lowly<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 95.</NOTE>; and the
French had all the lei&s;ure requi&s;ite for making prepara|tions
again&s;t him. The duke of Normandy, elde&s;t &s;on
of Philip, appeared in Brittany at the head of an army
of 30,000 infantry and 4000 cavalry; and Edward was
now obliged to draw together all his forces, and to en|trench
him&s;elf &s;trongly before Vannes, where the duke
of Normandy &s;oon after arrived, and in a manner invest|ed
the be&s;iegers. The garri&s;on and the French camp
were plentifully &s;upplied with provi&s;ions; while the Eng|li&s;h,
who dared to make no attempt upon the place in
the pre&s;ence of a &s;uperior army, drew all their &s;ub&s;i&s;tance
from England, expo&s;ed to the hazards of the &s;ea, and
&s;ometimes to tho&s;e ari&s;ing from the fleet of the enemy.
In this dangerous &s;ituation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1343.</NOTE> Edward very willingly hear|kened
to the mediation of the Pope's legates, the cardi|nals
of Pale&s;trine and Fre&s;cati, who endeavoured to ne|gotiate;
if not a peace, at lea&s;t a truce between the two
kingdoms. A treaty was concluded for a ce&s;&s;ation of
arms during three years<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv, I. chap. 99. Ave&s;bury, p. 102.</NOTE>; and Edward had the ability,
<PB N="435" REF="464">
notwith&s;tanding his pre&s;ent dangerous &s;ituation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1343</NOTE> to pro|cure
to him&s;elf very equal and honourable terms. It was
agreed, that Vannes &s;hould be &s;eque&s;tered, during the
truce, in the hands of the legates, to be di&s;po&s;ed of after|wards
as they plea&s;ed; and tho' Edward knew the par|tiality
of the court of Rome towards his antagoni&s;t, he
&s;aved him&s;elf by this device from the di&s;honour of having
undertaken a fruitle&s;s enterprize. It was al&s;e &s;tipulated,
that all pri&s;oners &s;hould be relea&s;ed, that, the places in
Brittany &s;hould remain in the hands of the pre&s;ent po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ors,
and that the allies on both &s;ides &s;hould be com|prehended
in the truce<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Heming. p. 359.</NOTE>. Edward, &s;oon after concluding
this treaty, embarked with his army for England.</P>
<P>THE truce, tho' calculated for a long time, was of
very &s;hort duration; and each monarch endeavoured to
throw on the other the blame of its infraction. Of
cour&s;e, the hi&s;torians of the two countries differ in their
account of the matter. It &s;eems probable, however, as
is affirmed by the French writers, that Edward, in
con&s;enting to the truce, had no other purpo&s;e than to
extricate him&s;elf from a perilous &s;ituation, into which he
had fallen, and was afterwards very carele&s;s of its ob|&s;ervance.
In all the memorials which remain on this
&s;ubject, he complains chiefly of the puni&s;hment inflicted
on Oliver de Cli&s;&s;on, Henry de Leon, and other Breton
noblemen, who, he &s;ays, were partizans of the family
of Mountfort, and con&s;equently under the protection of England<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. v. p. 453, 454, 459, 466, 496. Heming. p. 376.</NOTE>. But it appears from the hi&s;tory, that at the
conclu&s;ion of the truce, tho&s;e noblemen had openly, by
their declarations and actions, embraced the cau&s;e of
Charles de Blois<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 96. p. 100.</NOTE>; and if they had entered into any
&s;ecret corre&s;pondence and engagements with Edward,
they were traitors to their party, and were ju&s;tly punish|able
<PB N="436" REF="465">
by Philip and Charles, for their breach of faith;
nor had Edward any ju&s;t ground of complaint again&s;t
France for &s;uch &s;everities.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1344.</NOTE> But when he laid the&s;e pre|tended
injuries before the parliament, whom he affected
to con&s;ult on all occa&s;ions, that a&s;&s;embly entered into the
quarrel, advi&s;ed the King not to be amu&s;ed by a fraudu|lent
truce, and granted him &s;upplies for the renewal of
the war: The counties were charged with a fifteenth for
two years, and the boroughs with a tenth. The clergy
con&s;ented to give a tenth for three years.</P>
<P>THESE &s;upplies enabled the King to complete his mi|litary
preparations; and he &s;ent his cou&s;in, Henry earl
of Derby, &s;on of the earl of Lanca&s;ter, into Guienne,
for the defence of that province<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 103. Ave&s;bury, p. 121.</NOTE>. This prince, the
mo&s;t accompli&s;hed of the Engli&s;h court, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in a
high degree the virtue of humanity as well as tho&s;e of
valour and conduct<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">It is reported of this prince, that, having once, before the attack of a town, promi&s;ed the &s;oldiers the plunder, one private man hap|pened to fall upon a great che&s;t full of money, which he immediately brought to the earl, as thinking it too great for him&s;elf to keep po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. But Derby told him, that his promi&s;e did not depend on the greatne&s;s or &s;mallne&s;s of the &s;um; and bid him keep it all for his own u&s;e.</NOTE>, and not content with protecting
and cheri&s;hing the province committed to his charge, he
made a very &s;ucce&s;sful inva&s;ion on the enemy. He at|tacked
the count de Laille, the French general at Ber|gerac,
beat him from his entrenchments, and took the
place. He reduced a great part of Perigord, and conti|nually
advanced in his conque&s;ts, till the count de Laille,
having collected an army often or twelve thou&s;and men,
&s;at down before Auberoche, in hopes of recovering that
place, which had fallen into the hands of the Engli&s;h.
The earl of Derby came upon him by &s;urprize with only
a thou&s;and cavalry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1345.</NOTE> threw the French into di&s;order,
<PB N="437" REF="466">
pu&s;hed his advantages, and obtained a complete victory.
De Laille him&s;elf, with many con&s;iderable nobles, was,
taken pri&s;oner<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 104.</NOTE>. After this important advantage, Der|by
made a rapid progre&s;s in &s;ubduing the French pro|vinces.
He took Mon&s;egur, Monpe&s;at, Villefranche,
Miremont, and Tonnins, with the fortre&s;s of Dama&s;&s;en
Aiguillon, a fortre&s;s deemed impregnable, fell into his
hands from the cowardice of the governor. Angouleme
was &s;urrendered after a &s;hort &s;iege. The only place,
where he met with a con&s;iderable re&s;i&s;tance, was Reole,
which, however, was at la&s;t reduced after a &s;iege of above
nine weeks<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 110.</NOTE>. Having made an attempt on Blaye, he
thought it more prudent to rai&s;e the &s;iege, rather than
wa&s;te his time, before a place of &s;mall importance<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 112.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE rea&s;on why Derby was permitted without oppo|&s;ition
to make &s;uch progre&s;s on the &s;ide of Guienne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1346.</NOTE>
was the di&s;&s;iculties under which the French finances then
laboured, and which had obliged Philip to lay on new
impo&s;itions, particularly the duty on &s;alt, to the great
di&s;content, and almo&s;t mutiny of his &s;ubjects. But after
the court of France was &s;upplied with money, great pre|parations
were made; and the duke of Normandy, at|tended
by the duke of Burgundy, and other great nobi|lity,
led towards Guienne a powerful army, which the
Engli&s;h could not think of re&s;i&s;ting in the open field.
The earl of Derby &s;tood on the defen&s;ive, and allowed
the French to carry on at lei&s;ure the &s;iege of Angouleme,
which was their fir&s;t enterprize. John lord Norwich,
the governor, after a brave and vigorous defence, found
him&s;elf reduced to extremities; and he was obliged to
employ a &s;tratagem, in order to &s;ave his garri&s;on, and to
prevent his being reduced to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion.
<PB N="438" REF="467">
He appeared on the walls, and de&s;ired to &s;peak with
the duke of Normandy. The prince, when he came,
told Norwich, that he &s;uppo&s;ed he intended to capitu|late.
&startq;Not at all,&endq; replied the governor: &startq;But as to|morrow
is the fea&s;t of the Virgin, to whom, I know,
that you, Sir, as well as my&s;elf, bear a great devo|tion,
I de&s;ire a ce&s;&s;ation of arms for that day.&endq; The
propo&s;als were agreed to; and Norwich, having ordered
his forces to prepare all their baggage, marched out, and
advanced towards the French camp. The be&s;iegers,
imagining they were to be attacked, ran to their arms;
but Norwich &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger to the duke, reminding
him of his engagement. The duke, who piqued him&s;elf
on the faithful ob&s;ervance of his word, exclaimed, <HI>I &s;ee
the governor has outwitted me: But let us be contented with
gaining the place:</HI> And the Engli&s;h were allowed to pa&s;s
thro' the camp unmole&s;ted<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 120.</NOTE>. After &s;ome other &s;ucce&s;|&s;es,
the duke of Normandy laid &s;iege to Aiguillon; and
as the natural &s;trength of the fortre&s;s, together with a
brave garri&s;on under the command of the earl of Pem|broke,
and &s;ir Walter Manny, rendered it impo&s;&s;ible to
take the place by a&s;&s;ault, he propo&s;ed, after making &s;eve|ral
fruitle&s;s attacks<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 121.</NOTE>, to reduce it by famine: But be|fore

that ever befel the French monarchy<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 134.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>EDWARD, informed by the earl of Derby of the great
danger to which Guienne was expo&s;ed, had prepared a
fleet and army, with which he intended in per&s;on to bring
it relief. He embarked at Southampton on board a fleet
of near a thou&s;and fail of all dimen&s;ions; and carried
with him, be&s;ides all the chief nobility of England, his
<PB N="439" REF="468">
elde&s;t &s;on the prince of Wales,<NOTE PLACE="marg">12th July.</NOTE> now fifteen years of age.
The winds proved long contrary<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ave&s;bury, p. 123.</NOTE>; and the King, in
de&s;pair of arriving in time at Guienne, was at la&s;t per|&s;uaded
by Geoffry d'Harcourt, to change the de&s;tination
of his enterprize. This nobleman was a Norman by
birth, had long made a con&s;iderable figure in the court
of France, and was generally e&s;teemed for his per&s;onal
merit and valour; but being di&s;obliged and per&s;ecuted by
Philip, he had fled over to England; had recommended
himself to Edward, who was an excellent judge of men;
and had &s;ucceeded to Robert d'Artois in the invidious
office of exciting and a&s;&s;i&s;ting the King in every enter|prize
again&s;t his native country. He had long in&s;i&s;ted,
that an expedition to Normandy promi&s;ed, in the pre&s;ent
circum&s;tances, much more favourable &s;ucce&s;s, than one
to Guienne; that Edward would find the northern pro|vinces
much unfurni&s;hed of military force, which had
been drawn to the &s;outh; that they were full of &s;louri&s;h|ing
cities, who&s;e plunder would enrich the Engli&s;h; that
their cultivated fields, as yet un&s;poiled by war, would
&s;upply them with plenty of provi&s;ions; and that the
neighbourhood of the capital rendered every event of
importance in those quarters<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv, 1. chap. 121.</NOTE>. The&s;e rea&s;ons, which
had not before been duly weighed by Edward, began to
make more impre&s;&s;ion after the di&s;appointments, which
he had met with in his voyage to Guienne: He ordered
his fleet to &s;ail to Normandy, and &s;afely di&s;embarked his
army at la Hogue.</P>
<P>THIS army,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inva&s;ion of France.</NOTE> which was, during the cour&s;e of the en|&s;uing
campaign, crowned with the mo&s;t &s;plendid &s;ucce&s;s,
that ever attended the enterprize of any Engli&s;h monarch,
con&s;i&s;ted of four thou&s;and men at arms, ten thou&s;and
archers, ten thou&s;and Wel&s;h infantry, and &s;ix thou&s;and
Iri&s;h. The Wel&s;h and the Iri&s;h were light, di&s;orderly
<PB N="440" REF="469">
troops, fitter for doing execution in a pur&s;uit, or &s;couring
the country, than for any &s;table action. The bow was
always e&s;teemed a frivolous weapon, where true mili|tary
di&s;cipline was known, and regular bodies of well
armed foot maintained. The only &s;olid force in this
army were the men at arms, and even the&s;e, being ca|valry,
were, on that account, much inferior, in the
&s;hock of battle, to good infantry: And as the whole
were new levied troops, we are led to entertain a very
mean idea of the military force of tho&s;e ages, which,
being ignorant in every other art, had not properly culti|vated
the art of war it&s;elf, the &s;ole object of their at|tention.</P>
<P>THE King created the earl of Arundel con&s;table of
his army, and the earls of Warwic and Harcourt, mare&s;chals:
He be&s;towed the honour of knighthood on the
prince of Wales and &s;everal of the young nobility, im|mediately
upon his landing. After de&s;troying all the
&s;hips in la Hogue, Barfleur, and Cherbourg, he &s;pread
his army over the whole country, and gave them an un|bounded
licence of burning, &s;poiling, and plundering
every place, of which they became ma&s;ters. The loo&s;e
di&s;cipline then practi&s;ed, could not be much hurt by the&s;e
di&s;orderly practices; and Edward took care to prevent
any &s;urprize, by giving orders to his troops, however they
might di&s;per&s;e them&s;elves in the day time, always to
quarter them&s;elves at night near the main body. In this

over the whole province<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 122/.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE intelligence of this unexpected inva&s;ion &s;oon
reached Paris; and threw Philip into great perplexity.
<PB N="441" REF="470">
He i&s;&s;ued orders, however, for levying forces in all quar|ters,
and di&s;patched the count d'Eu, con&s;table of France,
and the count de Tancarville, with a body of troops, to
the defence of Ca&euml;n, a populous and commercial but
open city, which lay in the neighbourhood of the Eng|li&s;h
army. The temptation of &s;o rich a prize &s;oon al|lured
Edward to approach it; and the inhabitants, encou|raged
by their numbers, and by the re-inforcements
which they daily received from the country, ventured,
again&s;t the advice of the con&s;table, to meet him in the
field. But their courage failed them on the fir&s;t &s;hock:
They fled with precipitation: The counts d'Eu and
Tancarville were taken pri&s;oners: The victors entered
the city along with the vanqui&s;hed, and a furious ma&s;|&s;acre
commenced, without di&s;tinction of age, &s;ex, or
condition. The citizens, in de&s;pair, barricaded their
hou&s;es, and a&s;&s;aulted the Engli&s;h with &s;tones, bricks,
and every mi&s;&s;ile weapon: The Engli&s;h made way by
fire to the de&s;truction of the citizens: Till Edward,
anxious to &s;ave both his &s;poil and his &s;oldiers, &s;topped
the ma&s;&s;acre; and having obliged the inhabitants to lay
down their arms, gave his troops licence to begin a more
regular and le&s;s hazardous plunder of the city. The
pillage continued for three days: The King re&s;erved for
his own &s;hare the jewels, plate, &s;ilks, fine cloth, and
fine linen; and he be&s;towed all the remainder of the
&s;poil on his army. The whole was embarked on board
the &s;hips, and &s;ent over to England; together with
three hundred of the riche&s;t citizens of Ca$n, who&s;e
ran&s;om was an additional profit, which he expected after|wards
to levy<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 124.</NOTE>. This di&s;mal &s;cene pa&s;&s;ed in the pre|&s;ence
of two cardinal legates, who had come to nego|tiate
a peace between the kingdoms.</P>
<P><PB N="442" REF="471">
THE King moved next to Ro&uuml;en in hopes of treating
that city in the &s;ame manner; but found, that the bridge
over the Seine was already broken down, and that the
King of France him&s;elf was arrived there with his army.
He marched along the banks of that river towards Paris,
de&s;troying the whole country, and every town and vil|lage,
which he met with on his road<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;rt, liv. 1. chap. 125.</NOTE>. Some of his
light troops carried their ravages even to the gates of
Paris; and the royal palace of. St. Germans, together
with Nanterre, Ruelle, and other villages, was reduced
to a&s;hes within &s;ight of that capital. The Engli&s;h pro|po&s;ed
to pa&s;s the river at Poi&s;&s;y, but found the French
army encamped on the oppo&s;ite banks, and the bridge at
that place, as well as all others upon the Seine, broken
down by orders from Philip. Edward now &s;aw, that
the French intended to enclo&s;e him m their country, in
hopes of attacking him with advantage on all &s;ides:
But he &s;aved him&s;elf by a &s;tratagem from this perilous
&s;ituation. He gave his army orders to di&s;lodge, and to
advance farther up the Seine; but immediately returning
by the &s;ame route, arrived at Poi&s;&s;y, which the enemy
had already quitted, in order to attend his motions. He
repaired the bridge with incredible celerity, pa&s;&s;ed over
his army, and having thus di&s;engaged him&s;elf from the
enemy, advanced by quick marches towards Flanders,
His vanguard, commanded by Harcourt, met with the
town&s;men of Amiens, who were ha&s;tening to reinforce
their King, and defeated them with great &s;laughter<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>:
He pa&s;&s;ed by Beauvais, and burned the &s;uburbs of that
city: But as he approached the Somme, he found him&s;elf
in the &s;ame difficulty as before: All the bridges on that
river were either broken down, or &s;trongly guarded:
An army, under the command of Godemar de Faye,
<PB N="443" REF="472">
was &s;tationed on the oppo&s;ite banks: Philip was ad|vancing
on him from the other quarter, with an army of
an hundred thou&s;and men: And he was thus expo&s;ed to
the danger of being enclo&s;ed, and of &s;tarving in an ene|my's
country. In this extremity, he publi&s;hed a reward
to any one, that could bring him intelligence of a pa&s;|&s;age
over the Somme. A pea&s;ant, called Gobin Agace,
who&s;e name has been pre&s;erved by the &s;hare which he
had in the&s;e important tran&s;actions, was tempted on this
occa&s;ion to betray the intere&s;ts of his country; and he
informed Edward of a ford below Abbeville, which had
a &s;ound bottom, and might be pa&s;&s;ed without difficulty
at low water<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 126, 127.</NOTE>. The King ha&s;tened thither, but found
Godemar de Faye on the oppo&s;ite banks. Being urged
by nece&s;&s;ity, he deliberated not a moment; but threw
him&s;elf into the river, &s;word in hand, at the head of his
troops; drove the enemy from their &s;tation; and pur&s;ued
them to a di&s;tance on the plain<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 127.</NOTE>. The French army
under Philip, arrived at the ford, when the rear-guard of
the Engli&s;h were patting. So narrow was the e&s;cape,
which Edward, by his prudence and celerity, made from
this danger! The ri&s;ing of the tide prevented the French
King from following him over the ford, and obliged that
prince to take his road over the bridge at Abbeville; by
which fome time was lo&s;t.</P>
<P>IT is natural to think, that Philip, at the head of &s;o
va&s;t an army, was impatient to take revenge of the Eng|li&s;h,
and to prevent the di&s;grace to which he mu&s;t be
expo&s;ed, if an in&s;erior enemy &s;houd be allowed, after
ravaging &s;o great a part of his kingdom, to e&s;cape with
impunity. Edward al&s;o was &s;en&s;ible, that &s;uch mu&s;t be
the object of the French monarch; and as he had ad|vanced,
but a little way before his enemy, he &s;aw the
<PB N="444" REF="473">
danger of precipitating his march over the plains of Pi|cardy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Crecy. 26th Aug.</NOTE>
and of expo&s;ing his rear to the in&s;ults of the
numerous cavalry, in which the French camp abounded.
He took therefore a very prudent re&s;olution: He cho&s;e
his ground with advantage near the village of Crecy; he
di&s;po&s;ed his army in excellent order; he determined to
await in tranquillity the arrival of the enemy; and he
hoped, that their eagerne&s;s to engage, and to prevent his
retreat, after all their pa&s;t di&s;appointments, would hurry
them on to &s;ome ra&s;h and ill-concerted action. He drew
up his army on a gentle a&s;cent, and divided them into
three lines: The fir&s;t was commanded by the prince of
Wales, and under him, by the earls of Warwic and Ox|ford,
by Harcourt, and by the lords Chandos, Holland,
and other noblemen: The earls of Arundel and North|ampton,
with the lords Willoughby, Ba&s;&s;et, Roos,
and &s;ir Lewis Tu&s;ton, were at the head of the &s;econd
line: He took on him&s;elf the command of the third divi|&s;ion,
by which he propo&s;ed either to bring &s;uccour to the
two fir&s;t lines, or to &s;ecure a retreat in ca&s;e of any mi&s;|fortunes,
or to pu&s;h his advantages again&s;t his enemy.
He had likewi&s;e the precaution to throw up trenches on
his flank, in order to &s;ecure him&s;elf from the numerous
bodies of the French, who might a&s;&s;ail him from that
quarter; and he placed all his baggage behind him in a
wood, which he al&s;o &s;ecured by an intrenchment<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 128.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE &s;kill and order of this di&s;po&s;ition, with the tran|quillity
in which it was made, &s;erved extremely to com|po&s;e
the minds of the &s;oldiers; and the King, that he
might farther in&s;pirit them, rode thro' their ranks with &s;uch
an air of cheerfulne&s;s and alacrity in his countenance,
as conveyed the highe&s;t confidence into every beholder.
He pointed out to them the nece&s;&s;ity, to which they
<PB N="445" REF="474">
were at pre&s;ent reduced, and the certain and inevitable
de&s;truction which awaited them, if, in their pre&s;ent &s;itu|ation,
enclo&s;ed on all hands in an enemy's country,
they tru&s;ted to any thing but their own valour, or gave
that enemy an opportunity of taking revenge for the
many in&s;ults and indignities, which they had of late put
upon him. He reminded them of the apparent &s;upe|riority
which they had hitherto maintained over all the
bodies of French troops who had fallen in their way;
and a&s;&s;ured them, that the greater numbers of the army,
which at pre&s;ent hovered over them, gave them not
greater force, but was an advantage ea&s;ily compen&s;ated
by the order, in which he had placed his own army,
and the re&s;olution which he expected from them. He
demanded nothing, he &s;aid, but that they would imitate
his own example, and that of the prince of Wales; and
as the honour, the lives, the liberties of all, were now
expo&s;ed to the &s;ame danger, he was con&s;ident, that they
would make one common effort to extricate them&s;elves
from the pre&s;ent difficulties, and that their united cou|rage
would give them the victory over all their enemies.</P>
<P>IT is related by &s;ome hi&s;torians<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Jean Villani, lib. 12. cap. 66.</NOTE>, that Edward, be|&s;ides
the re&s;ources, which he found in his own genius
and pre&s;ence of mind, employed al&s;o a new invention
again&s;t the enemy, and placed in his front &s;ame pieces
of artillery, the fir&s;t which had yet been made u&s;e of on
and remarkable occa&s;ion in Europe. This is the epoch
of one of the mo&s;t &s;ingular di&s;coveries, which has been
made among men; and which changed by degrees the
whole art of war, and by con&s;equence many circum|&s;tances
in the political government of Europe. But the
ignorance of that age, in the mechanical arts, rendered
the progre&s;s very &s;low of this new invention. The ar|tillery
fir&s;t framed, were &s;o clum&s;y and of &s;uch difficult

management, that men were not immediately &s;en&s;ible of
their u&s;e and efficacy: And even to the pre&s;ent times,
improvements have been continually making on this fu|rious
engine, which, tho' it &s;eemed contrived for the
de&s;truction of mankind, and the overthrow of empires,
has in the i&s;&s;ue rendered war much le&s;s bloody, and has
given greater &s;tability to civil &s;ocieties. Nations, by its
means, have been brought more to a level: Conque&s;ts
have become e&s;s frequent and rapid: Succe&s;s in war has
been reduced nearly to be a matter of calculation: And any
nation, overmatched by its enemy, either yields to their
demands, or &s;ecures it&s;elf by alliances again&s;t their vio|lence
and inva&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE invention of artillery was at this time known in
France as well as in England<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Du Cange Glo&s;&s;. in verb. <HI>Bombarda.</HI></NOTE>; but Philip, in his hurry
to overtake the enemy, had probably left his cannon be|hind
him, which he regarded as an u&s;ele&s;s incumbrance.
All his other movements di&s;covered the &s;ame imprudence
and precipitation. Impelled by anger, a dangerous coun|&s;ellor,
and tru&s;ting to the great &s;uperiority of his num|bers,
he thought that all depended on forcing an engage|ment
with the Engli&s;h, and that, if he could once reach
the enemy in their retreat, the victory on his &s;ide was
certain and inevitable. He made a ha&s;ty march in great
di&s;order from Abbeville; but after he had advanced above
two leagues, &s;ome gentlemen, whom he had &s;ent before
to take a view of the enemy, returned to him, and brought
him intelligence, that they had &s;een the Engli&s;h drawn
up in excellent order, and awaiting his arrival. They
therefore advi&s;ed him to defer the combat till the en&s;uing
day, when his army would have recovered from their
fatigue, and might be di&s;po&s;ed into better order, than
their pre&s;ent hurry had permitted them to ob&s;erve. Phi|lip
a&s;&s;ented to this council; but the former precipitation
<PB N="447" REF="478">
of his march, and the impatience of the French nobility,
made it impracticable for him to put it in execution.
One divi&s;ion pre&s;&s;ed upon another: Orders to &s;top were
not &s;ea&s;onably conveyed to all of them: This immen&s;e
body was not governed by &s;ufficient di&s;cipline to be ma|nageable:
And the French army, very imperfectly
formed into three lines, arrived, already fatigued and dif|ordered,
in pre&s;ence of the enemy. The fir&s;t line, con|&s;i&s;ting
of 15,000 Genoefe cro&s;s-bow men, were com|manded
by Anthony Doria, and Charles Grimaldi: The
&s;econd was led by the count d'Alen&ccedil;on, brother to the
King: The King him&s;elf was at the head of the third.
Be&s;ides the French monarch, there were no le&s;s than
three crowned heads in this engagement: The King of
Bohemia, the King of the Romans, his &s;on, and the
King of Majorca; with all the nobility and great va&s;&s;als
of the crown of France. The army now con&s;i&s;ted of
above 120,000 men, near four times the number of the
enemy. But the prudence of one man was &s;uperior to
the advantage of all this force and &s;plendor.</P>
<P>THE Engli&s;h, on the approach of the enemy, kept
their ranks firm and immoveable; and the Genoefe fir&s;t
began the attack. There had happened, a little before
the engagement, a thunder &s;hower, which had moi&s;tened
and relaxed the &s;trings of the Genoe&s;e cro&s;s-bows; and
their arrows for this rea&s;on fell &s;hort of the enemy. The
Engli&s;h archers, taiking their bows out of their cafes,
poured in a &s;hower of arrows upon this multitude who
were oppo&s;ed to them; and &s;oon threw them into di&s;or|der.
The Genoe&s;e fell back upon the gens d'armes of
the count d'Alen$on<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 130.</NOTE>; who, enraged at their cowardice,
ordered his troops to put them to the &s;word. The artil|lery
fired amid&s;t the crowd; the Engli&s;h archers &s;till
continued to &s;end in their arrows among them; and
<PB N="448" REF="479">
nothing was to be &s;een in that va&s;t body but hurry and
confu&s;ion, terror and di&s;may. The young prince of
Wales had the pre&s;ence of mind to take advantage of this
&s;ituation, and to lead on his line to the charge. The
French cavalry, however, recovering &s;omewhat their
order, and encouraged by the example of their leader
made &s;tout re&s;i&s;tance; and having at la&s;t cleared them|&s;elves
of the Genoe&s;e runaways, advanced upon their ad|ver&s;aries,
and by their &s;uperior numbers began to hem
them round. The earls of Arundel and Northampton
advanced their line to &s;u&s;tain the prince, who, ardent in
his fir&s;t &s;eats of arms, &s;et an example of valour, which
was imitated by all his followers. The battle became
for &s;ome time hot and dangerous, and the earl of War|wic,
apprehen&s;ive of the event from the &s;uperior numbers
of the French, di&s;patched an officer to the King, and
de&s;ired him to &s;end &s;uccours to the relief of the prince.
Edward had cho&s;en his &s;tation on the top of the hill; and
he &s;urveyed in tranquillity the &s;cene of action. When the
me&s;&s;enger acco&s;ted him, his fir&s;t que&s;tion was, whether the
prince was &s;lain or wounded. On receiving an an&s;wer in
the negative, <HI>Return,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>to my &s;on and tell him that I
re&s;erve the honour of this day to him: I am confident that he
will &s;how him&s;elf worthy of the honour of knighthood, which I
&s;o lately conferred upon him: He will be able without my
a&s;&s;i&s;tance to repel the enemy</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 130.</NOTE>. This &s;peech, being re|ported
to the prince and his attendants, in&s;pired them
with new courage: They made an attack with redoubled
vigour on the French, in which the count d'Alen$on
was &s;lain: That whole line of cavalry was thrown into
di&s;order: The riders were killed or di&s;mounted: The
Wel&s;h infantry ru&s;hed into the throng, and with their
long knives cut the throats of all who had fallen;
nor was any quarter given that day by the conquerors<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 130.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="449" REF="480">
THE King of France advanced in vain with the rear
to &s;u&s;tain the line commanded by his brother: He
found them already di&s;comfited; and the example of
their rout encrea&s;ed the confu&s;ion, which was before but
too prevalent in his own body. He had him&s;elf a hor&s;e
killed under him: He was remounted; and, tho' left
almo&s;t alone, he &s;eemed &s;till determined to maintain the
combat; when John de Hainault &s;eized the reins of his
bridle, turned about his hor&s;e, and carried him off the
field of battle. The whole French army took to flight,
and were followed and put to the &s;word without mercy
by the victors; till the darkne&s;s of night put an end to
the pur&s;uit. The King, on his return to the camp, flew
into the arms of the prince of Wales, and exclaimed:
<HI>My brave &s;on: Per&s;evere in your honourable cour&s;e: You are
my &s;on; for valiantly have you acquitted your&s;elf to day: You
have &s;hewn your&s;elf worthy of empire</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 131.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS battle, which is known by the name of the bat|tle
of Crecy, began after three o'clock in the afternoon,
and continued till evening. The next morning was
foggy; and as the Engli&s;h ob&s;erved, that many of the
enemy had lo&s;t their way in the night and in the mi&s;t,
they employed a &s;tratagem to bring them into their
power: They erected on the eminences &s;ome French
&s;tandards which they had taken in the battle; and all,
who were allured by this fal&s;e &s;ignal, were put to the
&s;word, and no quarter given them. In excu&s;e for this
inhumanity, it was alledged that the French King had
given out like orders to his troops; but the real rea&s;on
probably was, that the Engli&s;h, in their pre&s;ent &s;ituation,
did not care to be encumbered with pri&s;oners. On the
day of battle, and on the en&s;uing, there fell, by a mo|derate
computation, 1200 knights, 1400 gentlemen,
4000 men at arms, be&s;ides about 30,000 men of inferior
<PB N="450" REF="481">
rank<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 131. Knyghton, p. 2588.</NOTE>. Many of the principal nobility of France, the
dukes of Lorraine and Bourbon, the earls of Flanders,
Blois, Harcourt, Vaudemont, Aumale, were left on the
field of battle. The Kings al&s;o of Bohemia and Ma|jorca
were &s;lain: The fate of the former was remark|able:
He was blind from age; but being re&s;olved to
hazard his per&s;on, and &s;et an example to others, he or|dered
the reins of his bridle to be tied on each &s;ide to
the hor&s;es of two gentlemen of his train; and his dead
body, and tho&s;e of his attendants, were afterwards found
among the &s;lain, with their hoi&s;es &s;tanding by them in
that &s;ituation<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 130. Wal&s;ingham, p. 166.</NOTE>. His cre&s;t was three o&s;trich feathers;
and his motto the&s;e German words, <HI>Ich dien, I &s;erve:</HI>
Which the prince of Wales and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors adopted in
memorial of this great victory. The action may &s;eem
no le&s;s remarkable for the &s;mall lo&s;s of the Engli&s;h than
for the great &s;laughter of the French: There were killed
in it only one e&s;quire and three knights<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Knyghton, p. 2588.</NOTE>, and very few,
of inferior rank; a demon&s;tration, that the prudent di&s;|po&s;ition
made by Edward, and the di&s;orderly attack of
the French, had rendered the whole rather a rout than a
battle, which was indeed the common ca&s;e with engage|ments
in tho&s;e times.</P>
<P>THE great prudence of Edward appeared not only in
obtaining this memorable victory, but in the mea&s;ures,
which he pur&s;ued after it. Not elated by his pre&s;ent
pro&s;perity &s;o far as to expect the total conque&s;t of France
or of any considerable provinces; he propo&s;ed only to
&s;ecure an ea&s;y entrance into that kingdom, which might
afterwards open the way to more moderate advantages.
He knew the extreme di&s;tance of Guienne: He had ex|perienced
the difficulty and uncertainty of penetrating on
<PB N="451" REF="482">
the &s;ide of the Low Countries, and had already lo&s;t
much of his authority over Flanders by the death of Ar|tevilie,
who had been murdered by the populace them|&s;elves,
his former partizans, on his attempting to transfer
the &s;overeignty of that province to the prince of Wales<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 116.</NOTE>.
The King, therefore, limited his ambition to the con|que&s;t
of Calais; and after the interval of a few days,
which he employed in interring the &s;lain, he marched
with his victorious army, and pre&s;ented him&s;elf before
that place.</P>
<P>JOHN DE VIENNE, a valiant knight of Burgundy,
was governor of Calais, and being &s;upplied with every
thing nece&s;&s;ary for defence, he encouraged the town&s;men
to perform to the utmo&s;t their duty to their King and
country. Edward therefore, &s;en&s;ible &s;rom the begin|ning,
that it was in vain to attempt the place by force,
propo&s;ed only to reduce it by famine: He cho&s;e a &s;ecure
&s;tation for his camp; drew entrenchments around the
whole city; rai&s;ed huts for his &s;oldiers, which he covered
with &s;traw or broom; and provided his army with all
conveniencies, to make them endure the winter &s;ea&s;on,
which was approaching. As the governor &s;oon perceived
his intention, he put out all the u&s;ele&s;s mouths, which
might con&s;ume his provi&s;ions; and the King had the
genero&s;ity to allow the&s;e unhappy people to pa&s;s thro' his
camp, and he even &s;upplied them with money for their
journey<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 133.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHILE Edward was employed in this &s;iege, which
continued near a twelvemonth, there pa&s;&s;ed in different
places many other events; and all to the honour of the
Engli&s;h arms.</P>
<P>THE retreat of the duke of Normandy from Guienne
left the earl of Derby ma&s;ter of the field; and he was not
<PB N="452" REF="483">
negligent in making his advantage of the &s;uperiority.
He took Mirebeau by a&s;&s;ault: He made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of
Lu&s;ignan in the &s;ame manner: Taillebourg and St. Jean

the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;urrendering his fortre&s;s, which was re|duced

Sir Walter Manny was &s;ent to him by Edward. &startq;Brave

endeavoured, as well as tho&s;e under me, to do our

<P>MANNY replied, that he was well acquainted with
the King of England's intentions; that that prince was
incen&s;ed again&s;t the town&s;men of Calais for their perti|nacious
re&s;i&s;tance, and for the evils which they had made
him and his &s;ubjects &s;uffer; that he was determined to
take exemplary vengeance of them; and would not re|ceive
the town on any conditions which &s;hould con&s;ine
him in the puni&s;hment of the&s;e offenders. &startq;Con&s;ider,&endq;
replied Vienne, &startq;that this is not the treatment to which
brave men are intitled: If any Engli&s;h knight had been
in my &s;ituation, your King would have expected the
&s;ame conduct from him. The inhabitants of Calais
have done for their &s;overeign what merits the esteem
of every prince; much more of &s;o gallant a prince as
Edward. But I inform you, that, if we mu&s;t peri&s;h,
we &s;hall not peri&s;h unrevenged; and that we are not
yet &s;o reduced, but we can &s;ell our lives at a high
price to the victors. It is the intere&s;t of both &s;ides to

you your&s;elf, brave knight, will interpo&s;e your good

<P>MANNY was &s;truck with the ju&s;tne&s;s of the&s;e &s;enti|ments,
and repre&s;ented to the King the danger of repri|zals,
if he &s;hould give &s;uch treatment to the inhabitants
of Calais. Edward was at la&s;t per&s;uaded to mitigate the

come to his camp carrying the keys of the city in their

&s;pare the lives of all the remainder<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 146.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN this intelligence was conveyed to Calais, it
&s;truck the inhabitants with new con&s;ternation. To &s;a|crifice
&s;ix of their fellow citizens to certain destruction,
for &s;ignalizing their valour in a common cau&s;e, appeared
to them even more &s;evere than that general puni&s;hment,
with which they were before threatened; and they found
them&s;elves incapable of coming to any re&s;olution in &s;o
cruel and di&s;tre&s;sful a &s;ituation. At la&s;t one of the prin|cipal
inhabitants called Eu&s;tace de St. Pierre, who&s;e
name de&s;erves to be recorded, &s;tept forth, and declared
him&s;elf willing to encounter death for the &s;afety of his
friends and companions: Another, animated by his ex|ample,
made a like generous offer: A third and a fourth
pre&s;ented them&s;elves to the &s;ame fate; and the whole
number required was &s;oon compleated. The&s;e &s;ix he|roic
burge&s;&s;es appeared before Edward in the gui&s;e of ma|lefactors,
laid at his feet the keys of their city, and were
ordered to be led to execution. It is &s;urprizing, that &s;o
generous a prince &s;hould ever have entertained &s;uch a
barbarous purpo&s;e again&s;t &s;uch men; and &s;till more that
he &s;hould &s;eriou&s;ly per&s;i&s;t in the re&s;olution of executing
it<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">This &s;tory of the &s;ix burghers of Calais, like all other extraordinary &s;tories, is &s;omewhat to be &s;u&s;pected; and &s;o much the more as Aves|bury, p. 167, who is particular in his narration of the &s;urrender of Calais, &s;ays nothing of it; and on the contrary extols in general the King's genero&s;ity and lenity to the inhabitants.</NOTE>. But the entreaties of his queen &s;aved his memory
from that infamy: She threw her&s;elf on her knees before
him, and with tears in her eyes begged the lives of the&s;e
citizens. Having obtained her reque&s;t, the carried them
into her tent, ordered a repa&s;t to be &s;et before them, and

them in &s;afety<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 146.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Calais;<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th Aug.</NOTE> and immediately
executed an act of rigor, more ju&s;tifiable becau&s;e more
nece&s;&s;ary, than that which he had before re&s;olved on.
He knew, that, notwith&s;tanding his pretended title to
the crown of France, every Frenchman regarded him
as a mortal enemy; and he therefore ordered all the in|habitants
of Calais to evacuate the town, and he peopled
it anew with Engli&s;h; a policy which probably pre&s;erved
&s;o long to his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors the dominion of that important
fortre&s;s. He made it the &s;taple of wool, leather, tin,
and lead; the four chief, if not the &s;ole commodities of
the kingdom, for which there was any con&s;iderable de|mand
in foreign markets. All the Engli&s;h were obliged
to bring thither the&s;e goods: Foreign merchants came to
the &s;ame place in order to purcha&s;e them: And at a period,
when po&s;ts were not e&s;tabli&s;hed, and when the
communication between &s;tates was &s;o imperfect, this in|&s;titution,
tho' it hurt the navigation of England, was per|haps
of advantage to the kingdom.</P>
<P>THRO' the mediation of the Pope's legates,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1348.</NOTE> Edward
concluded a truce with France; but even during this
ce&s;&s;ation of arms, he had very nearly lo&s;t Calais, the &s;ole
fruit of all his boa&s;ted victories. The King had entru&s;ted
that place to the command of Aimery de Pavie, an $a|lian,
who had di&s;covered bravery and conduct in the wars,
but was utterly devoid of every principle of honour and
&s;idelity. This man agreed to deliver up Calais for the
&s;um of 20,000 crowns; and Geoffrey de Charni, who
commanded the French forces in tho&s;e quarters, and
who knew, that, if he &s;ucceeded in this &s;ervice, he
&s;hould not be di&s;avowed, ventured, without consulting
<PB N="458" REF="489">
his ma&s;ter, to conclude the bargain with him. Edward,
informed of this treachery, by means of Aimery's &s;ecre|tary,
&s;ummoned the governor to London on other pre|tences;
and having charged him with the guilt, pro|mi&s;ed
him his life, but on condition, that he would turn
the contrivance to the de&s;truction of the enemy. The
Italian ea&s;ily agreed to this double treachery. A day was
appointed for the admi&s;&s;ion of the French; and Edward,
having prepared a force of about a thou&s;and men, under
Sir Walter Manny, &s;ecretly departed from London, car|rying
with him the prince of Wales; and without being
&s;u&s;pected, arrived the evening before at Calais. He
made a proper di&s;po&s;ition for the reception of the enemy;
and kept all his forces and the garri&s;on under arms. On
the appearance of Charni, a cho&s;en troop of French &s;ol|diers
was admitted at the po&s;tern, and Aimery, receiving
the &s;tipulated &s;um, promi&s;ed, that with their a&s;&s;i&s;tance
he would immediately open the great gate to the army,
who were waiting with impatience for the fulfilling of his
engagement. All the French, who entered, were im|mediately
&s;lain or taken pri&s;oners: The great gate open|ed:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1349.</NOTE>
Edward ru&s;hed forth with cries of battle and of
victory:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1st Jan.</NOTE> The French, tho' a&s;toni&s;hed at this event, be|haved
with valour: A fierce and bloody engagement
en&s;ued. As the morning broke, the King, who was
not di&s;tingui&s;hed by his arms, and who fought as a pri|vate
man under the &s;tandard of Sir Walter Manny, re|marked
a French gentleman, called Eu&s;tace de Ribau|mont,
who exerted him&s;elf with &s;ingular vigour and
bravery; and he was &s;eized with a de&s;ire of trying a
&s;ingle combat with him. He &s;tept forth from his troop,
and challenging Ribaumont by name, (for he was known
to him) began a &s;harp and dangerous encounter. He
was twice beat to the ground by the valour of the French|man:
He twice recovered him&s;elf: Blows were redou|bled
<PB N="459" REF="490">
with equal force on both &s;ides: The victory was
long undecided: Till Ribaumont, perceiving him&s;elf to
be left almo&s;t alone, called out to his antagoni&s;t, <HI>Sir
knight, I yield my&s;elf your pri&s;oner;</HI> and at the &s;ame
time delivered his &s;word to the King. Mo&s;t of the
French, being overpowered by numbers, and intercepted
in their retreat, were either &s;lain or taken pri&s;oners<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv, 1. chap. 140, 141, 142.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE French officers, who had. fallen into the hands
of the Engli&s;h, were conducted into Calais; where Ed|ward
di&s;covered to them the antagoni&s;t with whom they
had had the honour to be engaged, and treated them
with great regard and courte&s;y. They were admitted to
&s;up with the prince of Wales, and the Engli&s;h nobility;
and after &s;upper, the King him&s;elf came into the apart|ment,
and went about, conver&s;ing familiarly with one
or other of his pri&s;oners. He even addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in
an obliging manner to Charni, and avoided reproaching
him with the treacherous attempt, which he had made
upon Calais during the truce: But he openly be&s;towed
the highe&s;t encomiums on Ribaumont; called him the
mo&s;t valorous knight whom he had ever been acquainted
with; and confe&s;&s;ed, that he had at no time been in &s;o
great danger as when engaged in combat with him.
He then took a &s;tring of pearl, which he wore about his
own head, and throwing it over the head of Ribaumont,
he &s;aid to him, &startq;Sir Eu&s;tace, I be&s;tow this pre&s;ent upon
you, as a te&s;timony of my e&s;teem for your bravery:
And I de&s;ire you to wear it a year for my &s;ake: I know
you to be gay and amorous; and to take delight in
the company of ladies and dam&s;els: Let them all know
from what hand you had the pre&s;ent: You are no
longer a pri&s;oner; I acquit you of your ran&s;om; and
you are at liberty to morrow to di&s;po&s;e of your&s;elf as

NOTHING can more evidently prove the va&s;t &s;uperio|rity

<P>THE prudent conduct and great succe&s;s of Edward
in his foreign wars had excited a &s;trong emulation
and a military genius among the Engli&s;h nobility;<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XVI.</NOTE>
and the&s;e turbulent barons, over&horbar;awed by the crown, gave
now a more u&s;eful direction to their ambition, and at|tached
them&s;elves to a prince, who led them to the ac|qui&s;ition
of glory and of riches. That he might further
promote the &s;pirit of emulation and obedience, the King
instituted the order of the garter, in imitation of &s;ome
orders of a like nature, religious as well as military,
which had been e&s;tabli&s;hed in different countries of Eu|rope.<NOTE PLACE="marg">In&s;titution of the gar|ter.</NOTE>
The number received into this order con&s;i&s;ted of
twenty-four per&s;ons, be&s;ides the &s;overeign; and as it has
never been enlarged, this badge of di&s;tinction continues
as honourable as at its fir&s;t in&s;titution, and is &s;till a
valuable, tho' a cheap, pre&s;ent, which the prince can
confer on his greate&s;t &s;ubjects. A vulgar &s;tory prevails,
but is not &s;upported by any antient authority, that, at
a court-ball, Edward's mi&s;tress, commonly &s;uppo&s;ed to
<PB N="462" REF="493">
be the counte&s;s of Sali&s;bury, dropt her garter; and the
King, taking it up, ob&s;erved &s;ome of the courtiers to
&s;mile, as if he had not obtained this favour merely by
accident: Upon which he called out, <HI>Honi &s;oit qui
mal y pen&s;e,</HI> Evil to him that evil thinks; and as
every incident of gallantry among the&s;e antient warriors
was magni&s;ied into a matter of great importance<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">There was a &s;ingular in&s;tance about this time of the prevalance of chivalry and gallantry in the nations of Europe. A &s;olemn duel of thirty knights again&s;t thirty was fought between Bembrough, an Engli&s;h|man, and Beaumonoir, a Breton, of the party of Charles de Blois. The knights of the two nations came into the field; and before the combat began, Beaumonoir called out, that it would be &s;een that day <HI>who had the fairest mistre&s;&s;es.</HI> After a bloody combat the Bretons pre|vailed; and gained for their prize, full liberty to boa&s;t of their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es; beauty. It is remarkable, that two &s;uch famous generals as &s;ir Robert Knolles, and &s;ir Hugh Calverley, drew their &s;words in this ridiculous conte&s;t. See Pere Daniel, vol. ii. p. 536, 537, &amp;c. The women not only in&s;tigated the champions to the&s;e rough, if not bloody $rays of tournament; but al&s;o frequented the tournaments during all the reign of Edward, who&s;e &s;pirit of gallantry encouraged this pract&s;ice. See Kny$hton. p. 2597.</NOTE>, he
in&s;tituted the order of the garter in memorial of this
event, and gave the&s;e words as the motto of the order.
This origin, tho' frivolous, is not un&s;uitable to the man|ners
of the times; and it is indeed difficult by any other
means to account either for the &s;eemingly unmeaning
terms of the motto, or for the peculiar badge of the
garter, which &s;eems to have no reference to any purpo&s;e
either of military u&s;e or ornament.</P>
<P>BUT a &s;udden damp was thrown over this fe&s;tivity and
triumph of the court of England, by a de&s;tructive pe&s;ti|lence,
which invaded that kingdom as well as the re&s;t of
Europe; and is computed to have &s;wept away near a
third of the inhabitants in evert country, which it attack|ed.
It was probably more fatal in great cities than in
<PB N="463" REF="494">
the country; and above fifty thou&s;and &s;ouls are &s;aid to
have peri&s;hed by it in London alone<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Stowe's Survey, p. 478.

of the <HI>bad</HI> or <HI>wicked,</HI> and who&s;e actions fully entitled
him to that appellation. This prince was de&s;cended by
males of the blood royal of France; his mother was a
daughter of Lewis Hutin; he had him&s;elf e&s;pou&s;ed a
<PB N="464" REF="495">
daughter of King John: But all the&s;e ties, which ought
to have connected him with the throne, gave him only
greater ability to &s;hake and overthrow it. In his per|&s;onal
qualities, he was courteous, affable, engaging, elo|quent;
full of in&s;inuation and addre&s;s; inexhau&s;tible in
his re&s;ources; active and enterprizing. But the&s;e &s;plen|did
accomplishments were at the &s;ame time attended with
&s;uch defects, as rendered them pernicious to his country,
and even ruinous to him&s;elf: He was &s;ickle, incon&s;tant,
faithle&s;s, revengeful, malicious: Re&s;trained by no prin|ciple
or duty: In&s;atiable in his preten&s;ions: And whether
&s;ucce&s;sful or unfortunate in one enterprize, he immedi|ately
undertook another, in which he was never deterred
from employing the mo&s;t criminal and mo&s;t di&s;honourable
expedients.</P>
<P>THE con&s;table d'Eu, who had been taken pri&s;oner by
Edward at Caen, recovered his liberty, on the promi&s;e
of delivering to that prince, as his ran&s;om, the town of
Ghi&s;nes, near Calais, of, which he was &s;uperior lord:
But as John was offended at this &s;tipulation, which, if
fulfilled, opened &s;till farther that frontier to the enemy,
and as he &s;u&s;pected the con&s;table of more dangerous con|nections
with the King of England, he ordered him to
be &s;eized, and without any legal or formal trial, put him
to death in pri&s;on. Charles de la Cerda was appointed
con&s;table in his place; and had a like fatal end: The
King of Navarre ordered him to be a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated; and &s;uch
was the weakne&s;s of the crown, that this prince, in&s;tead
of dreading puni&s;hment, would not &s;o much as agree to
a&s;k pardon for his offence, but on condition, that he
received an acce&s;&s;ion of territory, and had John's &s;econd
&s;on put into his hands, as a &s;ecurity for his per&s;on, when
he came to court, and per&s;ormed this act of mock penitence
and humiliation before King John<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 144.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="465" REF="496">
THE two French princes &s;eemed entirely reconciled;
but this di&s;&s;imulation, to which John &s;ubmitted from
nece&s;&s;ity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1355.</NOTE> and Charles from habit, did not long continue;
and the King of Navarre knew, that he had rea&s;on to
apprehend the mo&s;t &s;evere vengeance for the many crimes
and trea&s;ons which he had already committed, and the
&s;till greater, which he intended to commit. To en&s;ure
him&s;elf of protection, he entered into a &s;ecret corre&s;pon|dence
with England, by means of Henry earl of Derby,
how earl of Lanca&s;ter, who at that time was employed
in fruitle&s;s negotiations for peace in Avignon, under the
mediation of the Pope. John di&s;covered this corre&s;pon|dence;
and to prevent the fatal effects of it, he &s;ent down
forces into Normandy, the chief &s;eat of the King of Na|varre's
power, and attacked his ca&s;tles and fortre&s;&s;es.
But hearing that Edward had prepared an army to &s;upport
his ally, he had the weakne&s;s to propo&s;e an accommodation
with Charles, and even to give this traiterous &s;ubject the
&s;um of a hundred thou&s;and crowns, as the purcha&s;e of a
feigned reconcilement, which rendered him &s;till more
dangerous. The King of Navarre, in&s;olent from pa&s;t
impunity, and de&s;perate from the dangers, which he ap|prehended,
continued &s;till his intrigues; and a&s;&s;ociating
him&s;elf with Geoffrey de Harcourt, who had received his
pardon from Philip de Valois, but per&s;evered &s;till in his
factious di&s;po&s;itions, he encrea&s;ed the number of his par|tizans
in every part of the kingdom. He even &s;educed
by his addre&s;s, Charles, the King of France's elde&s;t &s;on,
a youth of &s;eventeen years of age, who was the fir&s;t that
bore the appellation of Dauphin, by the re-union of the
province of Dauphiny to the crown. But this prince,
being made &s;en&s;ible of the danger and &s;olly of the&s;e con|nexions,
promi&s;ed to make atonement for the offence by
the &s;acrifice of his a&s;&s;ociates; and in concert with his
father, he invited the King of Navarre, and other noble|men
<PB N="466" REF="497">
of the party, to a fea&s;t at Ro&uuml;en, where
they were betrayed into the hands of John. Some of the mo&s;t ob|noxious
were immediately led to execution; the King
of Navarre was thrown into pri&s;on<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 146. Ave&s;bury, p. 243.</NOTE>: But this &s;troke of
&s;everity in the King, and of treachery in the Dauphin,
was far from proving deci&s;ive in maintaining the royal
authority. Philip of Navarre, brother to Charles, and
Geoffrey d'Harcourt, put all the towns and ca&s;tles be|longing
to that prince in a po&s;ture of defence; and had
immediate recour&s;e to the protection of England in this
de&s;perate extremity.</P>
<P>THE truce between the two kingdoms, which had
always been very ill ob&s;erved on both &s;ides, was now
expired; and Edward was entirely free to &s;upport the
French malecontents. Well plea&s;ed, that the factions
in France had at la&s;t gained him &s;ome partizans in that
kingdom, which his preten&s;ions to the crown had never
been able to procure him, he propo&s;ed to attack his
enemy both on the &s;ide of Guienne, under the command
of the prince of Wales, and on that of Calais, in his
own per&s;on.</P>
<P>YOUNG Edward arrived in the Garronne with his
army, on board a fleet of three hundred &s;ail, attended
by the earls of Warwic, Sali&s;bury, Oxford, Suffolk, and
other English noblemen. Being joined by the va&s;&s;als of
Ga&s;cony, he took the field; and as the pre&s;ent di&s;orders
in John's affairs prevented every proper plan of defence,
he carried on with impunity his ravages and deva&s;tations,
according to the mode of war in that age. He reduced
all the villages and &s;everal towns in Languedoc to a&s;hes:
He pre&s;ented him&s;elf before Thouloufe; pa&s;&s;ed the
Garronne, and burned the &s;uburbs of Carca&s;&s;onne; ad|vanced
even to Narbonne, laying every thing wa&s;te around
<PB N="467" REF="498">
him: And after an incur&s;ion of fix weeks, returned with
a va&s;t booty and many pri&s;oners to Guienne, where he
took up his winter quarters<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 144, 146.</NOTE>
. The con&s;table of Bourbon,
who commanded in tho&s;e provinces, received orders,
though at the head of a &s;uperior army, on no account to
run the hazard of a battle.</P>
<P>THE King of England's incur&s;ion from Calais was of
the &s;ame nature, and attended with the &s;ame i&s;&s;ue. He
broke into France at the head of a numerous army; to
whom he gave a full licence of plundering and ravaging
the open country. He advanced to St. Omer, where the
King of France was po&s;ted; and on the retreat of that
prince, followed him to He&s;din<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. Chap. 144. Ave&s;bury, p. 206. Wal&s;ing. p. 171.</NOTE>. John &s;till kept at a
di&s;tance, and declined an engagement: But in order to
&s;ave his reputation, he &s;ent Edward a challenge to fight
a pitched battle with him; an u&s;ual bravade in that age,
derived from the practice of &s;ingle combat, and ridiculous
in the art of war. The King, finding no &s;incerity
in this defiance, retired to Calais, and thence went over to
England, in order to defend that kingdom again&s;t a
threatened inva&s;ion of the Scots.</P>
<P>THE Scots, taking advantage of the King's ab&s;ence,
and that of the military power of England, had &s;urprized
Berwic; and had collected an army with a view of
entering and committing ravages upon the northern pro|vinces:
But on the approach of Edward, they abandoned
that place, which was not tenable, while the ca&s;tle was
in the hands of the Engli&s;h; and retiring to their moun|tains,
gave the enemy a full liberty of burning and
de&s;troying the whole country from Berwic to Edinburgh<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing. p. 171.</NOTE>.
Baliol attended Edward on this expedition; but finding,
that his con&s;tant adherence to the Engli&s;h had given his
<PB N="468" REF="499">
countrymen an unconquerable aver&s;ion to his title, and
that he him&s;elf was declining through age and infirmities,
he finally re&s;igned into the King's hands his preten&s;ions
to the crown of Scotland<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. v. p. 823. Ypod Neu&s;t. p. 521.</NOTE>, and received in lieu of them
an annual pen&s;ion of 2000 pounds, with which he pa&s;&s;ed
the remainder of his life in privacy and retirement.</P>
<P>DURING the&s;e military operations, Edward received
information of the encrea&s;ing di&s;orders in France, ari&s;ing
from the &s;eizure of the King of Navarre; and he &s;ent Lan|ca&s;ter
at the head of a &s;mall army, to &s;upport his partizans in
Normandy. The war was conducted with various &s;ucce&s;s;
but chiefly to the di&s;advantage of the French malecon|tents;
till an important event happened in the other
quarter of the kingdom, which had well nigh proved fatal
to the monarchy of France, and threw every thing into
the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE prince of Wales,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1356.</NOTE> encouraged by the &s;ucce&s;s of
the preceding campaign, took the field with an army,
which no hi&s;torian makes amount to above 12,000 men,
and of Which not a third were Engli&s;h; and with this
&s;mall body, he ventured to penetrate into the heart of
France. After ravaging the Agenois, Quercy, and the
Limou&s;in, he entered the province of Berry; and made
&s;ome attacks, tho' without &s;ucce&s;s, on the towns of
Bourges and I&s;&s;oudun. It appeared, that his intentions
were to march into Normandy, and to join his forces
with tho&s;e of the duke of Lanca&s;ter, and the partizans of
the King of Navarre; but finding all the bridges on the
Loire broke down, and every pa&s;s carefully guarded, he
was obliged to think of making his retreat into Guienne<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Walsing. p. 171.</NOTE>.
He found this re&s;olutian the more nece&s;&s;ary, from the
intelligence which he received of the King of France's
motions. That monarch, provoked at the in&s;ult offered
<PB N="469" REF="500">
him by this incursion, and entertaining hopes of &s;ucce&s;s
from the young prince's temerity, collected a great army
of above 60,000 men, and advanced with hasty marches
to intercept his enemy. The prince, not aware of John's
near approach, lo&s;t &s;ome days, on his retreat, before
the ca&s;tle of Remorantin<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv, 1. chap. 158. Wal&s;ing. p. 171.</NOTE>; and thereby gave the French
an opportunity of overtaking him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Poictiers.</NOTE> They came within
&s;ight at Maupertuis near Poictiers; and Edward, &s;en&s;ible
that his retreat was now become impracticable, prepared
for battle with all the courage of a young hero, and with
all the prudence of the olde&s;t and mo&s;t experienced
commander.</P>
<P>BUT the utmo&s;t prudence and courage would have
proved in&s;ufficiert to &s;ave him in this extremity, had
the King of France known how to make u&s;e of his pre&s;ent
advantages. His va&s;t &s;uperiority in numbers enabled
him to &s;urround the enemy; and by intercepting all their
provi&s;ions, which were already become &s;carce in the
Engli&s;h camp, to reduce this &s;mall army, without a blow,
to the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;urrendering at di&s;cretion. But &s;uch
was the impatient ardour of the French nobility, and &s;o
much had their thoughts been bent on overtaking the
Engli&s;h as their &s;ole object, that this idea never &s;truck
any of the commanders; and they immediately prepared
them&s;elves for the a&s;&s;ault, as for a certain victory. while
the French army was drawn. up in order of battle, they
were &s;lopped by the appearance of the cardinal of Perigord;
who, having learned the approach of the two armies to
each other, had ha&s;tened, by interpo&s;ing his good offices,
to prevent any farther effu&s;ion of Chri&s;tian blood. By
John's permi&s;&s;ion, he carried propo&s;als to the prince of
Wales; and found him &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the bad po&s;ture
of his affairs, that an accommodation &s;eemed not im|practicable.
Edward told him, that he would agree to
<PB N="470" REF="501">
any terms con&s;i&s;tent with his own honour and that of
England; and he offered to purcha&s;e a retreat by re&s;gn|ing
all the conque&s;ts, which he had made during this
and the former campaign, and by &s;tipulating not to &s;erve
again&s;t France during the cour&s;e of &s;even years. But
John, imagining that he had now got into his hands a
&s;ufficient pledge for the re&s;titution of Calais, required
that Edward &s;hould &s;urrender him&s;elf pri&s;oner with a
hundred of his attendants; and offered on the&s;e terms a
&s;a&s;e retreat to the Engli&s;h army. The prince rejected
the propo&s;al with di&s;dain; and declared, that whatever
fortune &s;should attend him, England &s;hould never be
obliged to pay the price of his ran&s;som. This re&s;olute
an&s;wer cut off all hopes of accommodation; but as the
day was already &s;pent in negociating, the battle was
delayed till the next morning<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Froiffart, liv. 1. Chap. 161.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE cardinal of Perigord, as all the prelates of the
court of Rome, was extremely attached to the French
cau&s;e; but the mo&s;t determined enemy could not have
contrived a greater prejudice to John's affairs, than he
did them by this delay.<NOTE PLACE="marg">19th Sept.</NOTE> The prince of Wales had
lei&s;ure, during the night, to &s;trengthen, by new intrench|ments,
the pot which he had before &s;o judiciou&s;ly cho&s;en;
and he contrived an ambu&s;h of 300 men at arms, and as
many archers, whom he put under the command of the
Captal de Buche, and ordered to make a circuit, that
they might fall on the flank or rear of the French army
during the engagement. The van of his army was
commanded by the earl of Warwic, the rear by the earls
Sali&s;bury and Suffolk, the main body by the prince him|self.
The lords Chandos, Audelcy, and many other
brave and experienced commanders, were at the head of
different corps of his army.</P>
<P><PB N="471" REF="502">
JOHN al&s;o arranged his forces in three divi&s;ions, nearly
equal: The fir&s;t was commanded by the duke of Orleans,
the King's brother; the &s;econd by the Dauphin attended
with his two younger brothers; the third by the King
him&s;elf, who had by his &s;ide Philip, his fourth &s;on and
favourite, then about fourteen years of age. There was
no reaching the Engli&s;h army but thro' a narrow lane,
covered on each fide by hedges; and in order to open
this pa&s;&s;age, the mare&s;chals, Andrehen and Clermont,
were ordered to advance with a &s;eparate detachment of
men at arms. While they marched along the lane, a
body of Engli&s;h archers, who lined the hedges, plyed
them on each &s;ide with their arrows; and being very
near them, yet placed in perfect &s;afety, they coolly took
their aim again&s;t the enemy, and ma&s;&s;acred them with
impunity. The French detachment, much di&s;couraged
with, the unequal fight, and dimini&s;hed in their number,
arrived at the end of the lane, where they met on the
open grounds the prince of Wales him&s;elf, at the head
of a cho&s;en body, ready for their reception. They were
di&s;comfited and overthrown: One of the mare&s;chals was
slain; the other taken pri&s;oner: And the remainder of
the detachment, who were &s;till in the lane, and expo&s;ed
to the &s;hot of the enemy, without being able to make
re&s;i&s;tance, recoiled upon their own army, and put every
thing into di&s;order<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Floissart, liv. 1. Chap. 162.</NOTE>. In that critical moment, the Captal
de Buche unexpectedly appeared, and attacked in flank
the Dauphin's line, which fell into Tome confu&s;ion.
Landas, Bodenai, and St. Venant, to whom the care of
that young prince and his brothers had been committed,
too anxious for their charge or for their own &s;afety,
carried them off the field of battle, and &s;et the example
of flight, which was followed by that whole divi&s;ion.
The duke of Orleans, feized with a like panic, and
<PB N="472" REF="503">
imagining, all was lo&s;t, thought no longer of fighting,
but carried off his divi&s;ion by a retreat, which loon turn|ed
al&s;o into a flight. The lord Chandos called out to
the prince, that the day was won; and encouraged him
to attack the divi&s;ion, under King John, which, tho'
more numerous than the whole Engli&s;h army, were
&s;omewhat di&s;mayed with the precipitate flight of their
companions. John here made the utmo&s;t efforts to re|trieve
by his valour, what his imprudence had betrayed;
and the only re&s;i&s;tance made that day was by his line of
battle. The prince of Wales fell with impetuo&s;ity on
&s;ome German cavalry placed in the front, and com|manded
by the counts of Sallebruche, Nydo, and No&s;to:
A fierce battle enfued: The one &s;ide were encouraged by
the near pro&s;pect of &s;o great a victory: The other were
retained by the &s;hane of quitting the field to an enemy
&s;o much inferior: But the three German generals,
together with the duke of Athens, con&s;table of France,
falling in battle, that body of cavalry gave way, and left
the King him&s;elf expo&s;ed to the whole fury of the enemy.
The ranks were every moment thinned around him:
The nobles fell by his fide, one after another: His &s;on,
&s;carce fourteen years of age, received a wound, while
he was fighting valiantly in defence of his father: The
King him&s;elf, &s;pent with fatigue, and overwhelmed by
numbers, might ea&s;ily have been di&s;spatched; but every
Engli&s;sh gentleman, ambitious of taking alive the royal
pri&s;oner, &s;pared him in the action, called to him to &s;ur|render
him&s;self, and offered him quarter: Several who
attempted to &s;eize. him, &s;uffered for their temerity. He
&s;till cried out, <HI>Where is my cou&s;in, the prince of Wales?</HI> and
&s;eemed unwilling to become pri&s;oner to any per&s;on of
inferior rank.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Captivity of the King of France.</NOTE> But being told, that the prince was at a
the King of great di&s;stance on the field, he threw down his gauntlet,
and yielded him&s;elf to Dennis de Morbec, a knight of
<PB N="473" REF="504">
Arras, who had been obliged to fly his country for murder.
His &s;on was taken with him<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. vi. p. 72, 154. Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 164.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE prince of Wales, who had been carried awy in
pur&s;uit of the flying enemy, finding the field entirely
clear, had ordered a tent to be pitched, and was repo&s;ing
him&s;elf after the toils of battle; enquiring &s;till with great
anxiety concerning the fate of the French monarch. He
di&s;patched the earl of Warwic to bring him intelligence,
and that nobleman came happily in time to &s;ave the life
of the captive prince, which was expo&s;ed to greater danger
than it had been during the heat of action. The Engli&s;h
had taken him by violence from Morbec: The Ga&s;cons
claimed the honour of detaining the pri&s;oner: And &s;ome
brutal &s;oldiers, rather than yield the prize to their rivals,
had threatened to put him to death<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 164.</NOTE>. Warwic overawed
both parties, and approaching the King with great de|mon&s;trations
of re&s;pect, offered to conduct him to the
prince's tent.</P>
<P>HERE commences the real and truly admirable heroi&s;m
of Edward: For victories are vulgar things in compari&s;on
of that moderation and humanity di&s;covered by a young
prince of twenty-&s;even years of age, not yet cooled from
the fury of battle, and elated by as extraordinary and
as unexpected &s;ucce&s;s as had ever crowned the arms of
any general. He came forth to meet the captive King
with all the &s;igns of regard and &s;ympathy; admini&s;tered
comfort to him amid&s;t his misfortunes; paid him the
tribute of prai&s;e due to his valour; and a&s;cribed his own
victory merely to the blind chance of war or to a &s;uperior
providence, which controuls all the efforts of human
force and prudence<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Poul. Oemil. p. 197.</NOTE>. The behaviour of John &s;howed
him not unworthy of this courteous treatment: His pre|&s;ent
abject fortune never made him forget a moment that
<PB N="474" REF="505">
he was a King: More &s;en&s;ible to Edward's genero&s;ity
than to his own calamities, he confe&s;&s;ed, that, notwith|&s;tanding
his defeat and captivity, his honour was &s;till
unimpared; and that, if he yielded the victory, it was at
lea&s;t gained by a prince of &s;uch con&s;ummate valour and
humanity.</P>
<P>EDWARD ordered a magnificent repa&s;t to be prepared
in his tent for the pri&s;oner; and he him&s;elf &s;erved the
royal captive's table, as if he had been one of his retinue:
He flood at the King's back during the meal; con&s;tantly
refu&s;ed to take a place at table; and declared, that, being
a &s;ubject, he was too well acquainted with the di&s;tance
between his own rank, and that of royal maje&s;ty, to a&s;|&s;ume
&s;uck. freedom. All his father's preten&s;ions to the
crown of France were now buried in oblivion: John in
captivity received the honours of a King, which were
refu&s;ed him when &s;eated on the throne: His misfortunes,
not his title, were re&s;pected: And the French pri&s;oners,
conquered by this elevation of mind, more than by their
late di&s;comfiture, bur&s;t out into tears of joy and admiration;
which were only checked by the reflection, that &s;uch ge|nuine
and unaltered heroi&s;m in an enemy mull certainly
in the i&s;&s;ue prove but the more dangerous to their native
country<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Froiffart, liv. 1. chap. 168.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ALL the Engli&s;h and Ga&s;con knights imitated the
generous example &s;et them by their prince. The cap|tives
were every where treated with humanity, and were
&s;oon after di&s;mi&s;&s;ed on paying moderate ran&s;oms to the
per&s;ons, into who&s;e hands they had fallen. The extent
of their fortunes was con&s;idered, and no more was exacted
of them than what would &s;till leave them &s;ufficient to
enable them, for the future, to perform their military
&s;ervice in a manner &s;uitable to their rank and quality.
Yet &s;o numerous were the noble pri&s;oners, that the&s;e
<PB N="475" REF="506">
ran&s;oms, joined to the &s;poils of the field, were &s;ufficient
to enrich the prince's army; and as they had &s;uffered
very little in the action, their joy and exultation was
complete.</P>
<P>THE prince of Wales conducted his pri&s;oner to Bourdeaux; and not being provided of forces &s;o numerous
as might enable him to pu&s;h his pre&s;ent advantages, he
concluded a two years truce with France<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. vi. p. 3.</NOTE>, which was
al&s;o become requi&s;ite, that he might conduct the captive
King with &s;afety into England.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1357.</NOTE> He landed at Southwark,

ranks and &s;tations. The pri&s;oner was clad in royal ap|parel,
and mounted on a white &s;teed, di&s;tingui&s;hed by its
&s;ize and beauty, and by the richne&s;s of its furniture.
The conqueror rode by his &s;ide in a meaner attire, and
carried by a black palfry. In this &s;ituation, much more
glorious than all the in&s;olent parade of a Roman tri|umph,
he pa&s;&s;ed thro' the &s;treets of London, and pre&s;ented
the King of France to his father, who advanced to meet
him, and received him with the &s;ame courte&s;y, as if he
had been a neighbouring potentate, who had voluntarily
come to pay him a friendly vi&s;it<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1, chap. 173.</NOTE>. It is impo&s;&s;ible, in
reflecting on this noble conduct, not to perceive the
advantages which re&s;ulted from the otherwi&s;e whim&s;ical
principles of chivalry, and which gave men in tho&s;e rude
times &s;ome &s;uperiority even over people of a more culti|vated
age and nation.</P>
<P>THE King of France, be&s;ides the generous treatment
which he met with in England, had the melancholy
con&s;olation of the wretched, to &s;ee companions in afflic|tion.
The King of Scots had been eleven years a cap|tive
in Edward's hands; and the good fortune of this
monarch had reduced at once the two neighbouring
<PB N="476" REF="507">
potentates, with whom he was engaged in war, to be
pri&s;oners in his capital. But Edward, finding that the
conque&s;t of Scotland was nowi&s;e advanced by the cap|tivity
of its &s;overeign, and that the government, con|ducted
by Robert Stuart, his heir and nephew, was &s;till
able to defend it&s;elf, con&s;ented to re&s;tore David Bruce
to his liberty, for the ran&s;om of 100,000 marks &s;terling;
and that prince delivered the &s;ons of all his principal
nobility, as ho&s;tages for the payment<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. vi. p. 45, 46, 52, 56. Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 174. Wal&s;ing. p. 173.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1358.</NOTE> the captivity of John, joined to the
preceding di&s;orders of the French government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of France.</NOTE> had
produced in that country a di&s;&s;olution, almo&s;t total, of
civil authority, and had occa&s;ioned confu&s;ions, the mo&s;t
horrible and de&s;tructive, which had ever been experienced
in any age or in any nation. The Dauphin, now about
eighteen years of age, naturally a&s;&s;umed the royal power
during his father's captivity; but tho' endowed with
excellent abilities, even in &s;uch early years, he po&s;&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
neither the experience nor authority requi&s;ite to defend
a &s;tate, a&s;&s;ailed at once by foreign power and &s;haken by
internal factions. In order to obtain &s;upply, he a&s;&s;embled
the e&s;tates of the kingdom: That a&s;&s;embly, in&s;tead of
&s;upporting his admini&s;tration, were them&s;elves &s;eized
with the &s;pirit of cor&s;u&s;ion; and laid hold of the pre&s;ent
opportunity to demand limitations of the prince's power, the puni&s;hment of
pa&s;t malver&s;ations, and the liberty of the King of Navarre. Marcel, provo&s;t of the merchants
and fir&s;t magi&s;trate of Paris, put him&s;elf at the head of
the unruly populace; and from the violence and temerity
of his character, pu&s;hed them to commit the mo&s;t criminal
outrages again&s;t the royal authority. They detained the
Dauphin in a &s;ort of captivity; they murdered in his
pre&s;ence Robert de Clermont and John de Conflans,
<PB N="477" REF="508">
mare&s;chals of France; they threatened all the other
mini&s;ters with a like fate; and when Charles, who was
obliged to temporize and di&s;&s;emble, made his e&s;cape from
their hands, they levied war again&s;t him, and openly
erected the &s;landard of rebellion. The other cities of
the kingdom, in imitation of the capital, &s;hook off the
Dauphin's authority; took the government into their own
hands; and &s;pread the di&s;order into every province.
The nobles, who&s;e inclinations led them to adhere to the
crown, and were naturally di&s;po&s;ed to check the&s;e tu|mults,
had lo&s;t all their influence; and being reproached
with cowardice on account of the ba&s;e de&s;ection of their
&s;overeign in the battle of Poictiers, were treated with
univer&s;al contempt by the inferior orders. The troops,
who, from the deficiency of pay, were no longer re|tained
in di&s;cipline, threw off all regard to their officers,
&s;ought the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence by pillage and robbery,
and a&s;&s;ociating to them all the di&s;orderly people, with
which that age abounded, formed numerous bands, which
infe&s;ted all quarters of the kingdom. They laid the
open country de&s;olate; burned and plundered the villages;
and by cutting off all means of communication or &s;ub&s;i&s;|tence,
reduced even the inhabitants of the walled towns
to the mo&s;t extreme nece&s;&s;ity. The pea&s;ants, formerly
oppre&s;&s;ed, and now left unprotected, by their ma&s;ters,
became de&s;perate from their pre&s;ent$mi&s;ery; and ri&s;ing
every where in arms, carried to the la&s;t extremity tho&s;e
di&s;orders, which were derived from the &s;edition of the
citizens and di&s;banded &s;oldiers<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 182, 183, 184.</NOTE>. The gentry, hated for
their tyranny, were every where expo&s;ed to the violence
of popular rage; and in&s;tead of meeting with regard for
their pa&s;t dignity, became only, on that account, the
object of more wanton in&s;ult to the mutinous pea&s;ants.
They were hunted like wild bea&s;ts, and put to the &s;word
<PB N="478" REF="509">
without mercy: Their ca&s;tles were con&s;umed with fire,
and levelled to the ground: Their wives and daughters
were fir&s;t ravi&s;hed, and then murdered: The &s;avages
proceeded &s;o far as to impale &s;ome gentlemen, and roa&s;t
them alive before a &s;low fire: A body of nine thou&s;and
of them broke into Meaux, where the wife of the
Dauphin with above 300 ladies had taken &s;helter: The
mo&s;t brutal treatment and mo&s;t atrocious cruelty were
ju&s;tly dreaded by this helple&s;s company: But the Captal
de Buche, tho' in the&s;fervice of Edward, yet moved by
genero&s;ity and by the gallantry of a true knight, flew to
their relief, and beat off the pea&s;ants with great &s;laughter.
In other civil wars, the oppo&s;ite factions, falling under
the government of their &s;everal leaders, commonly pre|&s;erve
&s;till the ve&s;tige of &s;ome rule and order: But here
the wild &s;tate of nature &s;eemed to be renewed: Every
man was thrown loo&s;e and independent of his fellows:
And the great multitude of people, which had ari&s;en
from the preceding police of civil &s;ociety, &s;erved only to
encrea&s;e the horrour and confu&s;ion of the &s;cene.</P>
<P>AMIDST the&s;e di&s;orders, the King of Navarre made
his e&s;cape from pri&s;on, and pre&s;ented a dangerous leader
to the furious malecontents<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 181.</NOTE>. But the &s;plendid talents
of this prince qualified him only to do mi&s;chief, and to
encrea&s;e the public confu&s;ions: He wanted the &s;teadine&s;s
and prudence requi&s;ite for making his intrigues &s;ub&s;ervient
to his ambition, and forming his numerous partizans into
a regular faction. He revived his preten&s;ions, &s;omewhat
ob&s;olete, to the crown of France; and indeed, if female
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion was to be admitted, his mother, the daughter
of Lewis Hutin, brought him undoubtedly the only
lawful title, and &s;lood before I&s;abella, the mother of
Edward, in the cour&s;e of de&s;cent. But while he ad|vanced
this claim, he relied entirely on his alliance with
<PB N="479" REF="510">
the Engli&s;h, who were concerned in intere&s;t to di&s;ap|point
his preten&s;ions, and who, being public and inve|terate
enemies to the &s;tate, &s;erved only, by the friend&s;hip
which they &s;eemingly bore him, to render his cau&s;e the
more odious. And in all his operations, he acted more
like a leader of banditti, than one who a&s;pired to be the
head of a regular government, and who was engaged by
his &s;tation to endeavour the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of order in
the community.</P>
<P>THE eyes, therefore, of all the French, who wi&s;hed
to re&s;tore peace to their mi&s;erable and de&s;olated country,
were turned towards the dauphin; and that young prince,
tho' not remarkable for his military talents, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;o
much prudence and &s;pirit, that he gained daily the a&s;|cendant
over all his enemies. Marcel, the &s;editious
provo&s;t, was &s;lain, while he was attempting to deliver
the city to the King of Navarre and the Engli&s;h; and
the capital immediately returned to its duty<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 187.</NOTE>. The
mo&s;t con&s;iderable bodies of the mutinous pea&s;ants were
di&s;&s;ipated, and put to the &s;word: Some bands of military
robbers underwent the &s;ame fate: And tho' many griev|ous
di&s;orders &s;till remained, France began gradually to
a&s;&s;ume the face of a regular civil government, and to
form &s;ome plan for its defence and &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>DURING the confu&s;ion in the Dauphin's affairs, Ed|ward
&s;eemed to have a favourable opportunity of pu&s;hing
his conque&s;ts: But be&s;ides that his hands were tied by
the truce, and he could only a&s;&s;i&s;t underhand the faction
of Navarre; the &s;tate of the Engli&s;h finances and military
power during tho&s;e ages rendered the kingdom incapable
of making any regular or &s;teady effort, and obliged it to
exert its force at very di&s;tant intervals, by which all the
projected ends were commonly di&s;appointed. Edward
employed him&s;elf, during a conjuncture &s;o inviting,
<PB N="480" REF="511">
chiefly in negotiations with his pri&s;oner; and John had
the weakne&s;s to &s;ign terms of peace, which, had they
taken effect, mu&s;t have totally ruined and di&s;membered
his kingdom. He agreed to re&s;tore all the provinces,
which had been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Henry II. and his two &s;ons,
and to annex them forever to England without any
obligation of homage or fealty on the part of the
Engli&s;h monarch. But the Dauphin arid the &s;tates of
France rejected this treaty, &s;o di&s;honourable and pernici|ous
to the kingdom<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 201.</NOTE>; and Edward, on the expiration of
the truce, having now, by &s;ub&s;idies and frugality, collected
&s;ome trea&s;ure, prepared him&s;elf for a new inva&s;ion of
France.</P>
<P>THE great authority and renown of the King and
the prince of Wales, the &s;plendid &s;ucce&s;s of their former
enterprizes, and the certain pro&s;pect of plunder from the
defencele&s;s provinces of France, &s;oon brought together
all the military power of England; and the &s;ame motives
invited to Edward's &s;tandard all the hardy adventurers of
the different countries of Europe<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 205.</NOTE>. He pa&s;&s;ed over to
Calais with an army of hear 100,000 men; a force,
which the Dauphin could not pretend to with&s;tand in the
open field: And he therefore prepared him&s;elf to elude
a blow, which it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to re&s;i&s;t. He
put all the con&s;iderable towns in a po&s;ture of defence;
ordered them to be &s;upplied with magazines and provi|&s;ions;
di&s;tributed proper garri&s;ons in all places; &s;ecured
every thing valuable in the fortified cities; and cho&s;e
his own &s;tation at Paris, with a view of allowing the
enemy to wa&s;te their fury on the open country.</P>
<P>THE King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1359.</NOTE> aware of this plan of defence, was obliged
to carry along with him &s;ix thou&s;and waggons loaded
with the provi&s;ions nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of his<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th Novr.</NOTE>
<PB N="481" REF="512">
army. After ravaging the province of Picardy, he ad|vanced
into Champagne; and having a &s;trong de&s;ire of
being crowned King of France at Rheims, the u&s;ual place
in which that ceremony is performed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inva&s;ion of France.</NOTE> he laid &s;iege to the
city, and carried on his attacks, tho' without &s;ucce&s;s,
for the &s;pace of &s;even weeks<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 208. Wal&s;ing. p. 174.</NOTE>. The place was bravely
defended by the inhabitants, encouraged by the exhor|tations
of the archbi&s;hop, John de Craon; till the ad|vanced
&s;ea&s;on (for this expedition was entered upon in
the beginning of winter) obliged the King to rai&s;e the
&s;iege. The province of Champagne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1360.</NOTE> meanwhile, was
laid de&s;olate by his incur&s;ions; and he thence conduct|ed
his army, with a like intent into Burgundy. He
took and pillaged Tonnerre, Gaillon, Avalon, and other
&s;mall places; but the duke of Burgundy, that he might
pre&s;erve his country from farther ravages, con&s;ented to
pay him the &s;um of 100,000 nobles<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. vi. p. 161. Wal&s;ing. p. 174.</NOTE>. Edward then
bent his march towards the Nivernois, which &s;aved it&s;elf
by a like compo&s;ition: He laid wa&s;te the Brie and the
Gatinois; and after a long march, very de&s;tructive to
France, and &s;omewhat ruinous to his own troops, he
appeared before the gates of Paris, and taking up his
quarters at Bourg-la-Reine, extended his army to Long-jumeau,
Mont-rouge and Vaugirard. He tried to pro|voke
the Dauphin to hazard a battle, by &s;ending him a
defiance; but could not make that prudent prince change
his plan of operations. Paris was &s;afe from the danger
of an a&s;&s;ault by its numerous garri&s;on; from that of a
blockade by its well &s;upplied magazines; and as Edward
could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t his own army in a country, wa&s;ted by
foreign and dome&s;tic enemies, and left al&s;o empty by
the precaution of the Dauphin, he was obliged to remove
his quarters, and he &s;pread his army into the provinces of
<PB N="482" REF="513">
Maine, Beau&s;&s;e, and the Chartraine, which were aban|doned
to the fury of their deva&s;tations<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing. p. 175.</NOTE>. The only re|po&s;e
which France experienced was during the fe&s;tival
of Ea&s;ter, when the King &s;lopped the cour&s;e of his
ravages. For &s;uper&s;tition can &s;ometimes re&s;train the
rage of men, which neither ju&s;tice nor humanity is able
to controul.</P>
<P>WHILE the war was carried on in this ruinous man|ner,
the negotiations for peace were never interrupted:
But as the King &s;till in&s;i&s;ted on the full execution of
the treaty, which he had made with his pri&s;oner at
London, and which was &s;trenuou&s;ly rejected by the Dau|phin,
there appeared no likelihood of an accommo|dation.
The earl, now duke of Lanca&s;ter (for this title
was introduced into England during the pre&s;ent reign)
endeavoured to &s;often the rigour of the&s;e terms, and to
fini&s;h the war on more equal and rea&s;onable conditions.
He in&s;i&s;ted, with Edward, that, notwith&s;tanding his
great and &s;urprizing &s;ucce&s;&s;es, the object of the war, if
&s;uch was to be e&s;teemed the acqui&s;ition of the crown of
France, was not become any nearer than at the com|mencement
of it; or rather, was &s;et at a greater dis|tance
by tho&s;e very victories and advantages, which
&s;eemed to lead to it. That his claim of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion had
not from the fir&s;t procured him one partizan in the
kingdom; and the continuance of the&s;e de&s;tructive ho&s;tilities
had united every Frenchman in the mo&s;t impla|cable
animo&s;ity again&s;t him. That tho' inter&s;tine faction
had crept into the government of France, it was abating
every moment; and no party, even during the greate&s;t
heat of the conte&s;t, when &s;ubjection under a foreign
enemy u&s;ually appears preferable to the dominion of
fellow citizens, had ever adopted the preten&s;ions of the
King of England. That the King of Navarre him&s;elf,
<PB N="483" REF="514">
who alone was allied with the Engli&s;h, in&s;tead of being
a cordial friend, was Edward's mo&s;t dangerous rival,
and in the opinion of his partizans appeared to po&s;&s;e&s;s a
much preferable title to the crown of France. That
the prolongation of the war, however it might enrich
the Engli&s;h &s;oldiers, was ruinous to the King him&s;elf,
who bore all the charges of the armament, without
reaping any &s;olid or durable advantage from it. That
if the pre&s;ent di&s;orders of France continued, that king|dom
would &s;oon be reduced to &s;uch de&s;olation as to
afford no &s;poils to its ravagers; if it could e&s;tabli&s;h a
more &s;teady government, it might turn the chance of
war in its favour, and by its &s;uperior force and advan|tages
be able to repel the pre&s;ent victors. That the
Dauphin, even during his greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;es, had yet
conducted him&s;elf with &s;o much prudence as to prevent
the Engli&s;h from acquiring one foot of land in the king|dom;
and it were better for the King to accept by a
peace what he had in vain attempted to acquire by
ho&s;tilities, which, however hitherto &s;ucce&s;sful, had been
extremely expen&s;ive, and might prove very dangerous.
And that Edward having acquired &s;o much glory by his
arms, the prai&s;e of moderation was the only honour,
which he could now a&s;pire to; an honour &s;o much the
greater, as it was durable, was united with that of pru|dence,
and might be attended with the mo&s;t real ad|vantages<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 211.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE rea&s;ons induced Edward to accept of more equitable terms of peace;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace of Bretigni.</NOTE> and it is probable, that, in order to palliate this change of re&s;olution, he a&s;cribed it to a vow, made during a terrible tempe&s;t which attacked his army on their march, and which the antient hi&s;torians repre&s;ent as the cau&s;e of this &s;udden accommo|dation<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 211.</NOTE>.

The conferences between the Engli&s;h and
French commi&s;&s;ioners were carried on during a few days
at Bretigni in the Chartraine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">8th May.</NOTE> and the peace was at la&s;t
concluded on the following conditions<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. vi. p. 178. Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 212.</NOTE>: It was &s;tipu|lated,
that King John &s;hould be re&s;tored to his liberty,
and &s;hould pay as his ran&s;om three millions of crowns of
gold, about 1,500,000 pounds of our pre&s;ent money<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">This is a prodigious &s;um, and probably near the half of what the King received from the parliament during the whole cour&s;e of his reign.

The good di&s;po&s;ition of John made him fully &s;en&s;ible of

By re&s;toring John to his liberty, and making peace at

renounced all preten&s;ions of this nature: He had &s;old
at a very high price that chimerical claim: And had

terms were &s;evere and rigorous upon him, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
&s;uch fidelity and honour, that he was determined at all
hazards to execute them, and to u&s;e every expedient for
&s;atisfying a monarch, who had indeed been his greate&s;t
political enemy, but had treated him per&s;onally with
&s;ingular humanity and regard. But, notwith&s;tanding all
his endeavours, there occurred many difficulties in ful|filling
his purpo&s;e; chiefly from the extreme reluctance,
which many towns and va&s;&s;als in the neighbourhood of
Guienne, expre&s;&s;ed again&s;t &s;ubmitting to the Engli&s;h do|minion<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 214.</NOTE>;
and John, in order to adju&s;t the&s;e differences,
took a re&s;olution of coming over him&s;elf into England.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1363.</NOTE>
His council endeavoured to di&s;&s;uade him from this ra&s;h
de&s;ign; and probably would have been plea&s;ed to &s;ee
him employ more chicanery, for eluding the execution
of &s;o di&s;advantageous a treaty: But John replied to
them, that, tho' good faith were bani&s;hed from the re&s;t
of the earth, &s;he ought &s;till to retain her habitation in
the brea&s;ts of princes. Some hi&s;torians would detract
from the merit of this honourable behaviour, by repre|&s;enting
John as enamoured of an Engli&s;h lady, to whom
he was glad, on this pretence, to pay a vi&s;it: But
be&s;ides, that this &s;urmi&s;e is not founded on any good
authority, it appears very unlikely on account of the
advanced age of that prince, who was now in his fifty-&s;ixth
year.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1364.</NOTE> He was lodged in the Savoy; the palace
<PB N="487" REF="518">
where he had re&s;ided during his captivity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">8th April.</NOTE> and where he
&s;oon after &s;ickened and died. Nothing can be a &s;tronger
proof of the great dominion of fortune over men, than
the calamities which pur&s;ued a monarch of &s;uch eminent
valour, goodne&s;s and honour, and which he incurred
merely by rea&s;on of &s;ome &s;light imprudences, which, in
other &s;ituations, would have beens of no importance.
But tho' both his reign and that of his father, proved ex|tremely
unfortunate to their kingdom, the French crown
acquired, during their time, very con&s;iderable acce&s;&s;ions,
tho&s;e of Dauphiny and Burgundy. This latter province,
however, John had the imprudence again to di&s;member
from the crown, by be&s;towing it on Philip his fourth
&s;on, and chief favourite<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. vi. p. 421.</NOTE>; a deed, which was afterwards
the &s;ource of many calamities to his kingdom.</P>
<P>JOHN was &s;ucceeded in the throne by Charles, the
Dauphin, a prince educated in the &s;chool of adver&s;ity,
and well qualified, by his con&s;ummate prudence and ex|perience,
to repair all the lo&s;&s;es, which the kingdom had
&s;uffered from the errors of his two predece&s;&s;ors. Con|trary
to the practice of all the great princes of tho&s;e
times, which held nothing in e&s;timation but military
courage, he &s;eems to have fixed it as a maxim never to
appear at the head of his armies; and he was the fir&s;t
King in Europe, who &s;howed the advantages of policy,
fore&s;ight and judgment, above a ra&s;h and precipitate va|lour.
The events of his reign, compared with tho&s;e of
the preceding, are a proof, how little rea&s;on kingdoms
have to value them&s;elves on their victories, or to be hum|bled
by their defeats, which in reality ought to be a&s;cribed
entirely to the good or bad conduct of their rulers, and
go a very little way towards determining national cha|racters
and manners.</P>
<P><PB N="488" REF="519">
BEFORE Charles could think of counter-balancing &s;o
great a power as England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of France.</NOTE> it was nece&s;&s;ary for him to
remedy the many di&s;orders, to which his own kingdom
was expo&s;ed. He turned his arms again&s;t the King of
Navarre, the great di&s;turber of France during that age:
He de&s;eated that prince by the conduct of Bertrand du
Gue&s;clin, a gentleman of Brittany, one of the mo&s;t ac|compli&s;hed
characters of the age, whom he had the dif|cernment
to choo&s;e as the in&s;trument of all his victories<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 119, 120, 122.</NOTE>:
And he obliged his enemy to accept of moderate terms
of peace. Du Gue&s;clin was le&s;s fortunate in the wars of
Brittany, which &s;till continued, notwith&s;tanding the me|diation
of France and England: He was defeated and
taken pri&s;oner at Auray by Chandos: Charles de Blois
was there &s;lain, and the young count de Mountfort &s;oon
after got entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that dutchy<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv 1. chap. 227, 228, &amp;c. Wal&s;ing, p. 180.</NOTE>. But the pru|dence
of Charles broke the force of this blow: He &s;ub|mitted
to the deci&s;ion of fortune: He acknowledged the
title of Mountfort, tho' a zealous partizan of England;
and received the proffered homage for his dominions.
But the chief ob&s;tacle which the French King met with
in the &s;ettlement of the &s;tate, proceeded from ob&s;cure
enemies, whom their crimes alone rendered eminent,
and their number dangerous.</P>
<P>ON the conclu&s;ion of the treaty of Bretigni, the many
military adventurers, who had followed the fortunes of
Edward, being di&s;per&s;ed into the &s;everal provinces, and
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;trong holds, refu&s;ed to lay down their arms,
or relinqui&s;h a cour&s;e of life, to which they were now
accu&s;tomed, and by which alone they could gain a &s;ub|&s;i&s;tance<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 214.</NOTE>.
They a&s;&s;ociated them&s;elves with the banditti, who were already enured to the habits of rapine. an vio|lence;
<PB N="489" REF="520">
and under the name of the <HI>companies</HI> and <HI>compa|nions,</HI>
became a terror to all the peaceable inhabitants.
Some Engli&s;h and Ga&s;con gentlemen of character, parti|cularly
Sir Matthew Gournay, Sir Hugh Calverley, the
chevalier Verte, and others, were not a&s;hamed to take
the command of the&s;e ruffians, who&s;e numbers amounted
on the whole to near 40,000 men, and who bore the
appearance of regular armies, rather than bands of rob|bers.
The&s;e leaders fought pitched battles with the
troops of France, and gained victories; in one of which
Jaques de Bourbon, a prince of the blood, was &s;lain<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 214, 215.</NOTE>:
And they proceeded to &s;uch a height, that they wanted
little but regular e&s;tabli&s;hments to become princes, and
thereby &s;anctify, by the maxims of the world, their in|famous
profe&s;&s;ion. The greater &s;poil they committed on
the country, the more ea&s;y they found it to recruit their
number: All tho&s;e, who were reduced to mi&s;ery and
de&s;pair, flocked to their &s;tandard: The evil was every
day increa&s;ing: And tho' the Pope declared them excom|municate,
the&s;e military plunderers, however deeply af|fected
with this &s;entence, to which they paid a much
greater regard than to any maxims of ju&s;tice or huma|nity,
could hot be induced by it to betake them&s;elves to
any peaceable or lawful profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>As Charles was not able by power to redre&s;s &s;o enor|mous
a grievance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1366.</NOTE> he was led, both by nece&s;&s;ity, and
by the turn of his character, to correct it by policy, and
to contrive &s;ome method of di&s;charging into foreign coun|tries
this dangerous and inte&s;tine evil.</P>
<P>PETER, King of Ca&s;tile, &s;tigmatized by his contem|poraries
and by po&s;terity, with the epithet of <HI>Cruel,</HI> had
filled with blood and murder his kingdom and his own
family; and having incurred the univer&s;al hatred of his
<PB N="490" REF="521">
&s;ubjects, he kept only from pre&s;ent terror an anxious
and precarious po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne. His nobles fell
every day the victims of his &s;everity: He put to death
&s;everal of his natural brothers from groundle&s;s jealou&s;y:
Each murder, by multiplying his enemies, became the
occa&s;ion of fre&s;h barbarities: And as he was not de&s;titute
of talents, his neighbours, no le&s;s than his own &s;ubjects,
were alarmed by the progre&s;s of his violence and inju&s;|tice.
The ferocity of his temper, in&s;tead of being &s;o&s;tened
by his &s;trong propen&s;ity to love, was rather enflamed by
that pa&s;&s;ion, and took thence new occa&s;ion to exert it&s;elf.
In&s;tigated by Mary de Padilla, who had acquired the
a&s;cendant over him, he threw into pri&s;on Blanche de
Bourbon, his wife, &s;i&s;ter to the Queen of France; and
&s;oon after made way by poi&s;on for the e&s;pou&s;ing of his
mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>HENRY, count de Tran&s;tamare, his natural brother,
&s;eeing the fate of every one who had become obnoxious
to this tyrant, took arms again&s;t him; but being foiled
in the attempt, he &s;ought for refuge in France, where
he found the minds of every one extremely enflamed
again&s;t Peter, on account of his murder of the French
prince&s;s. He propo&s;ed to Charles the enli&s;ting of the
<HI>companies</HI> into his &s;ervice, and leading them into Ca&s;tile;
where, from the concurrence of his own friends, and the
enemies of his brother, he had the pro&s;pect of certain
and immediate &s;ucce&s;s. The French King, charmed
with the project, employed du Gue&s;clin in negotiating
with the leaders of the&s;e banditti. The treaty was &s;oon
concluded. The high character of honour, which that
general po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, made every one tru&s;t to his promi&s;es:
Tho' the intended expedition was kept a &s;ecret, the compa|nies
implicitly inlifted under his &s;tandard: And they required
no other condition before their engagement, than an a&s;|&s;urance,
that they were not to be led again&s;t the prince
<PB N="491" REF="522">
of Wales in Guienne. But that prince was &s;o little aver&s;e
to the enterprize, that he allowed &s;ome gentlemen of his
retinue to enter into the &s;ervice under du Gue&s;clin.</P>
<P>DU GUESCLIN, having compleated his levies, led the
army fir&s;t to Avignon, where the Pope then re&s;ided, and
demanded, &s;word in hand, an ab&s;olution for his &s;oldiers,
and the &s;um of 200,000 livres. The fir&s;t was very rea|dily
promi&s;ed him; &s;ome more difficulty was made with
regard to the &s;econd. &startq;I believe my fellows,&endq; replied
du Gue&s;clin, &startq;may make a &s;hift to do without your
ab&s;olution; but the money is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.&endq;
The Pope then extorted from the inhabitants in the city
and neighbourhood the &s;um of an hundred thou&s;and
livres, and offered it to du Gue&s;clin. &startq;It is not my
purpo&s;e,&endq; cried that generous warrior, &startq;to oppre&s;s
the innocent people. The Pope and his cardinals
them&s;elves can ea&s;ily &s;pare me that &s;um from their
own pockets. This money, I in&s;i&s;t, mu&s;t be re&s;tored
to the owners. And &s;hould they be defrauded of it,
I &s;hall my&s;elf return from the other &s;ide of the Pyre|nees,
and oblige you to make them re&s;titution.&endq; The
Pope found the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and paid him,
from his own trea&s;ury, the &s;um demanded<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. du Gue&s;cli$.</NOTE>. The army
hallowed by the ble&s;&s;ings, and enriched by the &s;poils of

<P>THESE experienced and hardy &s;oldiers, conducted by
&s;o able a general, ea&s;ily prevailed over the King of Ca&s;|tile,

were ready to join the enemy again&s;t him<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 230.</NOTE>. Peter fled
from his dominions, took &s;helter in Guienne, and craved

in the place of the good prince of that name,
who had died without any male i&s;&s;ue, and who&s;e daugh|ter
he had e&s;pou&s;ed. Chandos al&s;o, who bore among
the Engli&s;h the &s;ame character, which du Gue&s;clin had
acquired among the French, commanded under him in
this expedition.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t blow which the prince of Wales gave to
Henry de Tran&s;tamare, Was the recalling all the <HI>compa|nies</HI>
from his &s;ervice; and &s;o much reverence did they
bear to the name of Edward, that great numbers of them
immediately withd$ew from Spain, and inli&s;ted under his
&s;tandard. Henry however, beloved by his new &s;ubjects,
and &s;upported by the King of Arragon and others of his
neighbours, was able to meet the enemy with an army of
100,000 men; forces three times more numerous than
tho&s;e commanded by Edward. Du Gue&s;clin and all his
experienced officers advi&s;ed him to delay any deci&s;ive
action, to cut off the prince of Wales's provi&s;ions, and
<PB N="493" REF="524">
to avoid every engagement with a general,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3d April.</NOTE> who&s;e enter|prizes
had hitherto been always conduced with prudence,
and crowned with, &s;ucce&s;s. Henry tru&s;ted too much to
his numbers; and ventured to encounter the Engli&s;h
prince at Najara<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. Chap. 241.</NOTE>. Hi&s;torians of that age are commonly
very copious in de&s;cribing the &s;hock of armies in battle,
the valour of the combatants, the &s;laughter and various
&s;ucce&s;ies of the day: But tho' &s;mall rencounters in tho&s;e
times were often well di&s;puted, the military di&s;cipline
was always too imperfect to pre&s;erve order in great ar|mies;
and &s;uch actions de&s;erve more the name of routs
than of battles. Henry was chaced off the field, with
the lo&s;s of above 20,000 men: There peri&s;hed only four
knights and forty private men on the &s;ide of the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>PETER, who &s;o well merited the infamous epithet
which he bore, propo&s;ed to murder all his pri&s;oners in
cold blood; but was re&s;trained from this barbarity by
the remon&s;trances of the prince of Wales. All Ca&s;tile
now &s;ubmitted to the victor: Peter was re&s;tored to the
throne: And Edward fini&s;hed this perilous enterprize;
with his u&s;ual glory. But he had &s;oon rea&s;on to repent
the a&s;&s;ociating him&s;elf with a man like Peter, abandoned,
to all &s;en&s;e of virtue and honour. The ungrateful ty|rant
refu&s;ed the &s;tipulated pay to the Engli&s;h forces; and
Edward, finding his &s;oldiers daily peri&s;h by &s;ickne&s;s, and,
even his own health impaired by the climate, was obliged,
without receiving any &s;atisfaction on this head, to return
into Guienne<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 242, 243. Wal&s;ingham, p. 182.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE mon&s;trous cruelties exerci&s;ed by. Peter over his
helple&s;s &s;ubjects, whom he now regarded as vanqui&s;hed
rebels, revived all the animo&s;ity of the Ca&s;tilians again&s;t
him; and on the return of Henry de Tran&s;tamare, to|gether
with du Gue&s;clin, and &s;ome forces levied anew
<PB N="494" REF="525">
in France, the tyrant was again dethroned, and was
taken pri&s;oner. His brother, in re&s;entment of his cru|elties,
murdered him with his own hand; and was
placed on the throne of Ca&s;tile, which he tran&s;mitted to
his po&s;terity. The duke of Lanca&s;ter, who e&s;pou&s;ed in
&s;econd marriage the elde&s;t daughter of Peter, inherited
only the empty title of that fovereignty, and encrea&s;ed
the animo&s;ity of the new King of Ca&s;tile again&s;t Eng|land.</P>

received from this &s;plendid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rupture with France.</NOTE> tho' imprudent expe&s;dition,
ended not with it. He had involved him&s;elf
in &s;o much debt by his preparations and the pay of his
troops, that he found it nece&s;&s;ary, on his return, to im|po&s;e
on his principality a new tax, which &s;ome of the
nobility &s;ubmitted to with extreme reluctance, and to which
others ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed compliance<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">This tax was a livre upon a hearth; and it was imagined, that this impo&s;ition would have yielded 1,200,000 livres a year, which &s;up|po&s;es &s;o many hearths in the, provinces po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Engli&s;h. But &s;uch loo&s;e conjectures have no manner of authority, much le&s;s, in &s;uch ignorant times. There was a &s;trong in&s;tance of it in the pre&s;ent reign. The hou&s;e of commons granted the King a tax of twenty-two &s;hillings on each pari&s;h, &s;uppo&s;ing that the amount of the whole would be 50,000 pounds. But they were found to be in a mi&s;take of near fix to one. Cotton, p. 3.

This incident revived the animo&s;ity which the inhabitants bore to the
Engli&s;h, and which all the amiable qualities of the prince
of Wales were not able to mitigate or a&s;&s;uage. They
complained, that they were con&s;idered as a conquered
people, that their privileges were di&s;regarded, that all

that the extreme reluctance, which mo&s;t of them had

long remembered again&s;t them. They ca&s;t, therefore,

<P>IN the treaty of Bretigni it had been agreed, that the

claim to the crown of France and to the provinces of
Normandy, Maine, and Anjou; John of the homage

take this mea&s;ure, le&s;s by the rea&s;onings of his civilians
and lawyers, than by the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of the two
monarchies. He con&s;idered the declining years of Ed|ward,
the langui&s;hing mate of the prince of Wales's
health, the affection which the inhabitants of all the&s;e
provinces bore to their antient ma&s;ter, their di&s;tance

and the ardour of the French nobility, they made every
day con&s;iderable progre&s;s again&s;t the Engli&s;h. The &s;tate
of the prince of Wales's health did not permit him to
mount on hor&s;eback, or exert his u&s;ual activity: Chan|dos,

<P>EDWARD, incen&s;ed at the&s;e injuries, threatened to

the vain title of King of France<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. vi. p. 621. Cotton's Abridg. p. 108.</NOTE>, he endeavoured to
&s;end &s;uccours into Ga&s;cony; but all his attempts, both
by &s;ea and land, proved un&s;ucce&s;sful. The earl of Pem|broke
was intercepted at &s;ea and taken pri&s;oner with his

He proceeded on his march to the provinces of

who was now created con&s;table of France, and

length of France from Calais to Bourdeaux; but was &s;o
much hara&s;&s;ed by the flying parties which attended him,
that he brought not the half of his army to the place of

enemy<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 1. chap. 321. Wal&s;ingham, p. 187.</NOTE>; after almo&s;t all his antient po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in France
had been ravi&s;hed from him, except Bourdeaux and Bay|onne,
and all his. conque&s;ts, except Calais.</P>
<P>THE decline of the King's life was expo&s;ed to many
mortifications, and corre&s;ponded not to the &s;plendid and
noi&s;y &s;cenes, which had filled the beginning and the
middle of it. Be&s;ides &s;eeing the lo&s;s of his foreign do|minions,
and being baffled in every attempt to defend them;
he felt the decay of his authority at home, and
experienced, from the &s;harpne&s;s of &s;ome parliamentary
remon&s;trances, the great incon&s;tancy of the people, and
the influence of pre&s;ent fortune over all their judgments<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ingham, p. 189. Ypod. Neu&s;t. 530.</NOTE>.
This prince, who, during the vigour of his age, had been
chiefly occupied in the pur&s;uits of war and ambition,
began, at an un&s;ea&s;onable period, to indulge him&s;elf in
<PB N="499" REF="530">
plea&s;ure; and being now a widower, he attached him&s;elf
to a lady of &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit, one Alice Pierce, who ac|quired
a great ascendant over him, and by her influence
gave &s;o much di&s;gu&s;t to his people, that, in order to &s;a|tisfy
the parliament, he was obliged to remove her from
court<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ingham, p. 189.</NOTE>. The indolence al&s;o, naturally attending old
age and infirmities, had made him, in a great mea&s;ure,
re&s;ign the admini&s;tration into the hands of his &s;on, the
duke of Lanca&s;ter; who, as he was far from being po|pular,
weakened extremely the affection, born by the
Engli&s;h to the per&s;on and government of the King.
Men carried their jealou&s;ies very far again&s;t the duke;
and as they &s;aw, with infinite regret, the death of the
prince of Wales every day approaching, they appre|hended,
le&s;t the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of his &s;on, Richard, now a
minor, &s;hould be defeated by the intrigues of Lanca&s;ter,
and by the weak indulgence of the old King. But Ed|ward,
in order to &s;atisfy both the people and the prince
on this head, declared in parliament his grand&s;on heir
and &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the crown; and thereby cut off all the
hopes of the duke of Lanca&s;ter, if he ever had the teme|rity
to entertain any.</P>
<P>THE prince of Wales,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1376.</NOTE> after a lingering illne&s;s, died
in the forty-&s;ixth year of his age;<NOTE PLACE="marg">8th June. Death of the prince of Wales.</NOTE> and left a character,
illu&s;trated by every eminent virtue, and from his earlie&s;t
youth till the hour he expired, un&s;tained by any blemi&s;h.
His valor and military talents formed the &s;malle&s;t part of
his merit: His genero&s;ity, humanity, affability, mode|ration,
gained him the affections of all the world; and
he was qualified to throw a lu&s;tre, not only on that rude
age, in which he lived, and which nowi&s;e infected him
with its vices, but on the mo&s;t &s;hining period of antient
or modern hi&s;tory. The King &s;urvived about a year this
<PB N="500" REF="531">
melancholy incident:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1377.</NOTE> England was deprived at once of
both of the&s;e princes, its chief ornament and &s;upport:
He expired in the &s;ixty-fifth year of his age and the fifty|first
of his reign; and the people were &s;en&s;ible, tho' too
late, of the irreparable lo&s;s, which they had &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P>THE Engli&s;h are apt to con&s;ider with peculiar fond|ne&s;s
the history of Edward III.<NOTE PLACE="marg">21&s;t June. Death and charac|ter of the King.</NOTE> and to e&s;teem his reign,
as it was one of the longe&s;t, the mo&s;t glorious al&s;o, which
occurs in the annals of their nation. The a&s;cendant
which they then began to acquire over France, their
rival and national enemy, makes them ca&s;t their eyes on
this period with great complacency, and &s;anctifies every
mea&s;ure, which Edward embraced for that end. But
the dome&s;tic government of this prince is really more ad|mirable
than his foreign victories; and England enjoyed,
by the prudence and vigor of his admini&s;tration, a longer
interval of dome&s;tic peace and tranquillity than &s;he had
been, ble&s;t with in any former period, or than &s;he expe|rienced
for many ages after. He gained the affections of
the great, yet curbed their licentiou&s;ne&s;s: He made them
feel his power, without their daring, or even being in|clined,
to murmur at it: His affable and obliging beha|viour,
his munificence and genero&s;ity, made them &s;ub|mit
with plea&s;ure to his dominion; his valor and con|duct
made them &s;ucce&s;sful in mo&s;t of their enterprizes;
and their unquiet &s;pirits, directed again&s;t a public enemy,
had no lei&s;ure to breed tho&s;e di&s;turbances, to which they
were naturally &s;o much inclined, and which the frame
of the government &s;eemed &s;o much to authorizer This
was the chief benefit, which re&s;ulted from Edward's
victories and conque&s;ts. His foreign wars were, in other
re&s;pects, neither founded in ju&s;tice, nor directed to any
very &s;alutary purpo&s;e. His attempt again&s;t the King of
Scotland, a minor and a brother-in-law, and the revival
of his grandfather's claim of &s;uperiority over that king|dom,
<PB N="501" REF="532">
were both un&s;ea&s;onable and ungenerous; and he
allowed him&s;elf to be too &s;oon &s;educed, by the glaring
pro&s;pect of French conque&s;ts, from the acqui&s;ition of a
point, which was practicable, and which might really,
if attained, have been of la&s;ting. utility to his country
and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. The &s;uece&s;s, which he met with in
France, tho' chiefly owing to his eminent talents, was
unexpected; and yet, from the very nature of things,
not from any unfore&s;een accidents, was found, even
during his own life-time, to have procured him no &s;olid
advantages. But the glory of a conqueror is &s;o dazling
to the vulgar, the animo&s;ity of nations is &s;o extreme,
that the fruitle&s;s de&s;olation of &s;o fine a part of Europe, as
France, is totally di&s;regarded by us, and is never con&s;i|dered
as a blemi&s;h in the character or conduct of this
prince: And indeed, from the unfortunate &s;tate of
human nature, it will commonly happen that a &s;overeign of
great genius, &s;uch as Edward, who u&s;ually finds every
thing ea&s;y in his dome&s;tic government, will turn him&s;elf
towards military enterprizes, where alone he meets with
oppo&s;ition, and where he has full exerci&s;e for his indu&s;try
and capacity.</P>
<P>EDWARD had a numerous po&s;terity by his Queen,
Philippa of Hainault. His elde&s;t &s;on was the heroic
Edward, commonly called the Black Prince, from the
colour of his armour. This prince e&s;&s;ed his cou&s;in
Joan, commonly called the <HI>fair maid of Kent,</HI> daughter
and heir of his uncle, the earl of Kent, who was beheaded
in the beginning of this reign. She was fir&s;t married to
Sir Thomas Holland, by whom the had children. She
had a &s;on, Richard, by the prince of Wales, who alone
&s;urvived his father.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd &s;on of King Edward (for we pa&s;s over
&s;uch as died in their childhood) was Lionel duke of Cla|rence,
who was fir&s;t married to Elizabeth de Burgh,
<PB N="502" REF="533">
daughter and heir of the earl of Ul&s;ter, by whom he left
only one daughter, married to Edmund Mortimer, earl
of Marche. Lionel e&s;pou&s;ed in &s;econd marriage, Vio|lante,
the daughter of the duke of Milan<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. vi, p. 364.</NOTE>, and died in
Italy &s;oon after the con&s;ummation of his nuptials, with|out
leaving any po&s;terity by that prince&s;s. Of all the
family, he re&s;embled mo&s;t his father and elde&s;t brother in
his noble qualities.</P>
<P>EDWARD'S third &s;on was John of Gaunt, &s;o called
from the place of his birth: He was created duke of
Lanca&s;ter; and from him, &s;prung that branch, which
afterwards po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the crown. The fourth &s;on of this
royal family was Edmund, created earl of Cambridge by
his father, and duke of York by his nephew. The fifth
ton was Thomas, who received the title of earl of Buck|ingham
from his father, and that of duke of Gloce&s;ter
from his nephew. In order to prevent confu&s;ion, we
&s;hall always di&s;tingui&s;h the&s;e two princes by the titles of
York and Gloce&s;ter, even before they were advanced to them.</P>
<P>THERE were al&s;o &s;everal prince&s;&s;es born to Edward
by Philippa, <HI>viz.</HI> I&s;abella, Joan, Mary and Margaret,
who e&s;pou&s;ed, in the order of their names, Ingelram de
Coucy earl of Bedford, Alphon&s;o King of ca&s;tile, John
de Mountfort duke of Brittany, and John Ho&s;tings earl
of Pembroke. The prince&s;s Joan died at Bourdeaux
before the con&s;ummation of her marriage.</P>
<P>IT is remarked by an elegant hi&s;torian<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Dr. Robert&s;on's Hi&s;ory of Scotland, book 1.</NOTE>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mi&s;cella|neous tran&s;|actions in this reign.</NOTE> that Con|querors,
tho' u&s;ually the bane of human kind, proved
often, in tho&s;e feudal times, the mo&s;t indulgent of &s;ove|reigns:
They &s;tood mo&s;t in need of &s;upplies from their
people; and not being able to compel them by force to
<PB N="503" REF="534">
&s;ubmit to the nece&s;&s;ary impo&s;itions, they were obliged
to make them &s;ome compen&s;ation, by equitable laws and
popular conce&s;&s;ions. This remark is, in &s;ome mea&s;ure,
tho' imperfectly, ju&s;tified by the conduct of Edward III.
He took no &s;teps of moment without con&s;ulting his par|liament,
and obtaining their approbation, which he after|wards
pleaded as a rea&s;on for their &s;upporting his mea|&s;ures<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Cotton's Abridg. p. 108, 120.</NOTE>.
The parliament therefore role into greater con|&s;ideration
during his reign, and acquired a more regular
authority than in any former times; and even the hou&s;e
of commons, which, during turbulent and factious pe|riods,
was naturally oppre&s;&s;ed by the greater power of
the crown and barons, began to appear of &s;ome weight in
the con&s;titution. In the latter years of Edward, the
King's mini&s;ters were impeached in parliament, particu|larly
lord Latimer, who fell a &s;acrifice to their authority<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">cotton's Abridg. p. 122.</NOTE>;
and they even obliged him to bani&s;h his &s;tre&s;s by their
remon&s;trances. Some attention was al&s;o paid to the
elections of their members; and lawyers, in particular,
who were, at that time, men of very inferior character,
were totally excluded the hou&s;e during &s;everal parlia|ments<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Cotton's Abridg. p. 18.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ONE of the mo&s;t popular laws, enacted by any prince,
was the statute, which pa&s;&s;ed in the twenty-fifth of this
reign<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">chap. 2.</NOTE>, and which limited the ca&s;es of high trea&s;on,
before vague and uncertain, to three principal heads, the
con&s;piring the death of the King, the levying war again&s;t
him, and the adhering to his enemies; and the judges
were prohibited, if any other ca&s;es &s;hould occur, from
inflicting the penalty of trea&s;on, without an application
to parliament. The bounds of trea&s;on were indeed &s;o
much limited by this &s;tatute, which &s;till remains in force
without any alteration, that the lawyers were obliged to
<PB N="504" REF="535">
enlarge them, and to explain a con&s;piracy for levying
war again&s;t the King to be equivalent to a con&s;piracy
again&s;t his life; and this interpretation, &s;eemingly forced,
has, from the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e, been tacitly acqui|e&s;ced
in. It was al&s;o ordained, that a parliament &s;hould be
held once a year or of$ner, if need be: A law which,
like many others, was never ob&s;erved, and lo&s;t its autho|rity
by di&s;u&s;e<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">4 Edw. III. cap. 14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>EDWARD granted above twenty parliamentary confir|mations
of the great charter; and the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions are
commonly appealed to as proofs of his great indulgence
to the people, and his tender regard to their liberties.
But the contrary pre&s;umption is much more natural. If
the maxims of Edward's reign had not been in general
&s;omewhat arbitrary, and if the great charter had not been
frequently violated, the parliament would never have
applied for the&s; frequent confirmations, which could
add no force to a deed regularly ob&s;erved, and which
could &s;erve to no other purpo&s;e, than to prevent the con|trary
precedents from turning into a rule, and acquiring
authority. It was indeed the effect of the irregular go|vernment
during tho&s;e ages, that a &s;tatute, which had
been enacted &s;ome years, in&s;tead of acquiring, was ima|gined
to lo&s;e force by time, and needed to be often re|newed
by recent &s;tatutes of the &s;ame &s;en&s;e and tenor.
Hence likewi&s;e that general clau&s;e, &s;o frequent in old
acts of parliament, that the &s;tatutes, enacted by the
King's progenitors, &s;hall be &s;erved<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">36 Edw. III. cap. 1. 37 Edw. III. cap. 1, &amp;c.</NOTE>; a precaution,
which, if we do not con&s;ider the circum&s;tances of the
times, might appear ab&s;urd and ridiculous. The fre|quent
confirmations in general terms of the church's pri|vileges
proceeded from the fame cau&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="505" REF="536">
IT is a clau&s;e in one of Edward's &s;tatutes, <HI>that no man,
of what e&s;tate or condition &s;oever, &s;hall be put out of land or
tenement, nor taken nor impri&s;oned, nor di&s;herited, nor put to
death, without being brought in an&s;wer by due proce&s;s of the law</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">28 Edw. III. cap. 3.</NOTE>.
This privilege was &s;ufficiently &s;ecured by a clau&s;e
of the great charter, which had received a general con|firmation
in the fir&s;t chapter of the &s;ame &s;tatute. Why
then is this clau&s;e &s;o anxiou&s;ly, and, as we may think,
&s;o &s;uperfluou&s;ly repeated? Plainly; becau&s;e there had been
&s;ome late infringements of it, which gave umbrage to
the commons<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">They plainly a&s;&s;ert, in the 15th of this reign, that there had been &s;uch in&s;tances. Cotton's Abridg. p. 31. They repeat the &s;ame in the 21&s;t Year. see p. 59.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT there is no article, in which the laws are more
frequently repeated during this reign, almo&s;t in the &s;ame
terms, than that of purveyance, which the parliament
always calls an <HI>outrageous</HI> and <HI>intolerable</HI> grievance, and
the &s;ource of <HI>infinite</HI> damage to the people<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">36 Edw. III. &amp;c.</NOTE>. The par|liament
tried to aboli&s;h this prerogative altogether, by
prohibiting any one to take goods without the con&s;ent of
the owners<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">14 Edw. III cap. 19.</NOTE>, and by changing the heinous name of pur|veyors,
as they call it, into that of <HI>buyers</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">36 Edw. III. cap. 2.</NOTE>: But the arbi|trary
conduct of Edward &s;till brought back the grievance
upon them; tho' contrary both to the Great Charter,
and to many &s;tatutes. This di&s;order was in a good mea|&s;ure
derived from the &s;tate of the public finances and of
the kingdom; and could therefore the le&s;s admit of any
remedy. The prince frequently wanted ready money;
yet his family mu&s;t be provided for: And he was obliged
to employ force and violence for that purpo&s;e, and to
give tallies, at what rate he plea&s;ed, to the owners of
<PB N="506" REF="537">
the goods which he laid hold of. The kingdom al&s;o
abounded &s;o little in commodities, that, had the owners
been &s;trictly protected by law, they could ea&s;ily have
exacted any price from the King; e&s;pecially in his fre|quent
progre&s;&s;es, when he came to di&s;tant and poor places, where
the court did not u&s;ually re&s;ide, and where a regular plan for &s;upplying it could not ea&s;ily be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed.</P>
<P>THE magnificent ca&s;tle of Wind&s;or was built by Ed|ward
III. and his method of conducing that work
may &s;erve as a &s;pecimen of the condition of the
people in that age. In&s;tead of alluring workmen by
contracts and wages, he a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed every county in England
to &s;end him &s;o many ma&s;ons, tilers, and carpenters, as
if he had been levying an army<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">A&s;hmole's hi&s;t. of the garter, p. 129.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THEY mi&s;take, indeed, very much the genius of this
reign, who imagine that it was not very arbitrary. All
the high prerogatives of the crown were to the full ex|erted
in it; but what was &s;ome con&s;olation, and pro|mi&s;ed
in time &s;ome relief to the people, they were always
complained of by the commons: Such as the di&s;pen&s;ing

<P>BUT there was no act of arbitrary power more fre|quently
repeated in this reign, than that of the impo&s;ition
of taxes without con&s;ent of parliament. Tho' that a&s;|&s;embly
granted the King more &s;upplies than ever had been obtained by any of his predece&s;&s;ors, his great under|takings
and the nece&s;&s;ity of his affairs obliged him &s;till to
levy more; and after his great &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t France had
added weight to his authority, these impo&s;itions became

<P>THE King openly avowed and maintained this power
of levying taxes at plea&s;ure. At one time, he replied to
the remon&s;trance of the commons, that the impo&s;itions
had been exacted from great nece&s;&s;ity, and had been
a&s;&s;ented to by the prelates, counts, barons, and <HI>&s;ome</HI> of
the commons<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 53. He repeats the &s;ame an&s;wer in p. 60. <HI>Some of the commons</HI> were &s;uch as he was plea&s;ed to con&s;ult with.</NOTE>; at another, that he would advi&s;e with
his council<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 57.</NOTE>. When the parliament de&s;ired, that a law
might be enacted for the puni&s;hment of &s;uch as levied the&s;e arbitrary impo&s;itions; he refu&s;ed compliance<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 138.</NOTE>. In
<PB N="508" REF="539">
the &s;ub&s;equent year, they de&s;ire$ that the King might
renounce this pretended prerogative; but his an&s;wer
was, that he would levy no taxes without nece&s;&s;ity, for
the defence of the realm, and where he rea&s;onably might
u&s;e that authority<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 152.</NOTE>. This incident patted a very few
days before his death; and the&s;e were, in a manner, his la&s;t words to his people. It would &s;eem, that the famous
charter or &s;tatute of Edward I. <HI>de tallagio non concedendo,</HI>
tho' never repealed, was &s;uppo&s;ed to have already lo&s;t by
age all its authority.</P>
<P>THESE facts can only &s;how the <HI>practice</HI> of the times:
For as to the <HI>right,</HI> the continual remon&s;trances of the
commons may &s;eem to prove that it rather lay on their
&s;ide: At lea&s;t, the&s;e remon&s;trances &s;erved to prevent the
arbitrary practices of the court from becoming an e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
part of the con&s;titution. In &s;o much a better
condition were the privileges of the people even during
the arbitrary reign of Edward III. than during &s;ome
&s;ub&s;equent ones, particularly tho&s;e of the Tudors, where
no tyranny or abu&s;e of power ever met with any check
or oppo&s;ition, or &s;o much as a remon&s;trance, from par|liament.</P>
<P>IT is ea&s;y to imagine, that a prince of &s;o much &s;en&s;e
and &s;pirit as Edward, would be no &s;lave to the court of
Rome. Tho' the old tribute was paid during &s;ome years
of his minority<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iv. p. 434.</NOTE>, he afterwards withheld it; and when
the Pope in 1367 threatened to cite him to the court of
Rome, for default of payment, he laid the matter before
his parliament. That a&s;&s;embly unanimou&s;ly declared, that
King John could not, without a national con&s;ent, &s;ubject
his kingdom to a foreign power: And they were
therefore determined to &s;upport their &s;overeign again&s;t
this exorbitant pretenfion<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Cotton's Abridg. p. 110.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="509" REF="540">
DURING this reign, the &s;tatute of provi&s;ors was
enacted, rendering it penal to procure any presentations
to benefices from the court of Rome, and &s;ecuring the
rights of all patrons and electors, which had been ex|tremely
encroached on by the Pope<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">25 Edw. III. 27 Edw. III.</NOTE>. By a &s;ub&s;equent
&s;tatute, every per&s;on was out-laved who carried any
cau&s;e or appeal to the court of Rome<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">27 Edw. III. 38 Edw. III.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE laity at this time &s;eem to have been extremely
prejudiced again&s;t the papal power, and even &s;omewhat
again&s;t their own clergy, becau&s;e of their connexions
with the Roman pontiff. They pretended that the u&s;ur|pations
of the Pope were the cau&s;e of all the plagues,
injuries, famine, and poverty of the realm; was more
de&s;tructive to it than all the wars; and was the cau&s;e
why it contained not a third of the inhabitants and com|modities,
which it formerly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed: That the taxes,
levied by him, exceeded five times tho&s;e paid to the King:
That every thing was venal in that &s;inful city of Rome;
and that even the patrons in England had thence learned
to practice &s;imony without remor&s;e or &s;cruple<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 74, 128, 129.</NOTE>. At
another time, they petition the King to employ no
churchman in any office of &s;tate<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 112.</NOTE>; and they even &s;peak,
in plain terms, of expelling by force the papal authority,
and thereby providing a remedy again&s;t oppre&s;&s;ions, which
they neither could nor would any longer endure<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 41.</NOTE>. Men
who talked in this &s;train, were not &s;ar from the reforma|tion:
But Edward did not think proper to &s;econd all this
zeal. Tho' he pa&s;&s;ed the &s;tatute of provi&s;ors, he took
little care of its execution; and the parliament made fre|quent
complaints of his negligence on this head<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 119, 128, 129, 130, 148.</NOTE>. He
was content with having reduced &s;uch of the Romi&s;h ec|cle&s;ia&s;tics,
<PB N="510" REF="541">
as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed revenues in England, to depend
entirely upon him by means of that &s;tatute.</P>
<P>As to the police of the kingdom during this period, it
was certainly better than during the times of faction,
civil wars, and di&s;order, to which England was &s;o often
expo&s;ed: Yet were there &s;everal vices in the con&s;titution,
the bad con&s;equences of which all the power and vigi|lance
of the King could not prevent. The barons, by
their confederacies with tho&s;e of their own order, and by
&s;upporting and defending their retainers in every iniquity<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">11 Edw. III. cap. 14. 4 Edw. III. cap. 2. 15 Edw. III. cap. 4</NOTE>,
were the chief abettors of robbers, murderers, and ruf|fians
of all kinds; and no law could be executed again&s;t
the&s;e criminals. The nobility were brought to give their
promi&s;e in parliament, that they would not avow, retain,
or &s;upport any felon or breaker of the law<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 10.</NOTE>; yet this
engagement, which we may wonder to &s;ee exacted from
men of their rank, was never regarded by them. The
commons make continual complaints of the multitude of
robberies, murders, ravi&s;hment of women, and other
di&s;orders, which, they &s;ay, were become numberle&s;s in
every part of the kingdom, and which they always a&s;cribe
to the protection which the criminals received from the
great<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 51, 62, 64, 70, 160.</NOTE>. The King of Cyprus, who paid a vi&s;it to Eng|land
during this reign, was robbed and &s;tript on the
high-way with his whole retinue<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing. p. 179.</NOTE>. Edward him&s;elf
contributed to this di&s;&s;olution of law, by his facility in
granting pardons to felons from the &s;olicitation of his
courtiers. Laws were made to retrench this preroga|tive<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Edw. III. cap. 2. 27 Edw. III. Cap. 2.</NOTE>,
and remon&s;trances of the commons were pre&s;ented
again&s;t the abu&s;e of it<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p 75.</NOTE>: But to no purpo&s;e. The gra|tifying
a nobleman of power and intere&s;t continued &s;till
<PB N="511" REF="542">
to be of more importance than the protection of the peo|ple.
The King al&s;o granted many franchi&s;es, which
interrupted the cour&s;e of ju&s;tice and the execution of the laws<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 54.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>COMMERCE and indu&s;try were certainly at a very low
ebb during this period. The bad police of the country
alone affords a &s;ufficient rea&s;on. The only exports were
wool, &s;kins, hydes, leather, butter, tin, lead, and &s;uch
unmanufactured goods, of which wool was by far the
mo&s;t con&s;iderable. Knyghton has a&s;&s;erted, that 100,000
&s;acks of wool were annually exported, and &s;old at twenty
pounds a &s;ack, money of that age. But he is widely
mi&s;taken both in the quantity exported and the value.
In 1349, the parliament remon&s;trate, that the King, by
an illegal impo&s;ition of forty &s;hillings on each &s;ack ex|ported,
had levied 60,000 pounds a year<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 48, 69.</NOTE>: Which re|duces
the annual exports to 30,000 &s;acks. A &s;ack con|tained
twenty-&s;ix &s;tone, and each &s;tone fourteen pounds<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">34 Edw. III. cap. 5.</NOTE>;
and at a medium was not valued at above five pounds a
&s;ack<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 29.</NOTE>, that is, fourteen or fifteen pounds of our pre&s;ent
money. Knyghton's computation rai&s;es it to &s;ixty pounds,
which is near four times the pre&s;ent price of wool in
England. According to this reduced computation, the
export of wool returned about 450,000 pounds of our
pre&s;ent money, in&s;tead of &s;ix millions, which is an ex|travagant
&s;um.</P>
<P>EDWARD endeavoured to introduce and promote the
woollen manufacture by giving protection and encou|ragement
to foreign weavers<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">11 Edw. III. cap. 5. Rymer, vol. iv. p. 723. Murimuth, p. 88.</NOTE>, and by enacting a law,
prohibiting every one to wear any cloth but of Engli&s;h
make<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">11 Edw. III, cap. 2.</NOTE>. The parliament prohibited the exportation of
<PB N="512" REF="543">
woollen goods, which was not &s;o well judged, e&s;pecially
while the exportation of unwrought wool was &s;o much
allowed and encouraged. A like injudicious law was
made again&s;t the exportation of manufactured iron<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">28 Edw. III. cap. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t of Richard II. the parliament complains
extremely of the decay of &s;hipping during the preceding
reign, and a&s;&s;ert, that one &s;ea-port formerly contained
more ve&s;&s;els than were then to be found in the whole
kingdom. This calamity, they a&s;cribe to the arbitrary
&s;eizure of &s;hips by Edward, for the &s;ervice of his frequent
expeditions<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 155, 164.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE parliament attempted the impracticable &s;cheme of
reducing the price of labour after the pe&s;tilence, and al&s;o
that of poultry<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">37 Edw. III. cap. 3.</NOTE>. A reaper, in the fir&s;t week of Au|gu&s;t,
was not allowed to take above two pence a day, or
near &s;ix pence of our pre&s;ent money; in the &s;econd week
a third more. A ma&s;ter carpenter was limited thro' the
whole year to three pence a day, a common carpenter to
two pence, money of that age<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">25 Edw. III. cap. 1, 3.</NOTE>. It is remarkable, that
in the &s;ame reign, the pay of a common &s;oldier, an ar|cher,
was &s;ix pence a day; which, by the change, both
in denomination and value, would be equivalent to four
or five &s;hillings of our pre&s;ent money<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Dugdale's baronage, vol. i. p. 784. Brady's hi&s;t. vol. ii. App. N^o. 92. The pay of a man at arms was quadruple. We may there|fore conclude, that the numerous armies, mentioned by hi&s;torians in tho&s;e times, con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of ragamuffins, who followed the camp, and lived by plunder. Edward's army before Calais con&s;i&s;ted of 31,094 men; yet its pay for &s;ixteen months was only 127,201 pounds. Bra|dy&punc; ibid.</NOTE>. Soldiers were
then inli&s;ted only for a very &s;hort time: They lived idle
all the re&s;t of the year, and commonly all the re&s;t of
their lives: One &s;ucce&s;sful campaign, by pay and plun|der,
and the ran&s;om of pri&s;oners, was &s;uppo&s;ed to be a
<PB N="513" REF="544">
&s;mall fortune to a man; which was a great allurement
to enter into the &s;ervice<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Commodities &s;eem to have ri&s;en &s;ince the Conque&s;t. In&s;tead of being ten times cheaper than at pre&s;ent, they were in the age of Edward III. only three or four times.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE &s;taple of wool, wool-fells, leather, and lead, was
fixed by act of parliament in particular towns of Eng|land<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">27 Edw. III.</NOTE>.
Afterwards it was removed by law to Calais:
But Edward, who commonly deemed his prerogative &s;u|perior
to law, paid little regard to the&s;e &s;tatutes; and
when the parliament remon&s;trated with him on account
of &s;uch acts of power, he told them plainly, that he
would proceed in that matter as he thought proper<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 117.</NOTE>. It
is not ea&s;y to perceive any advantages, which aro&s;e from
this great anxiety of fixing a &s;taple; unle&s;s perhaps it
invited foreigners to a market, when they knew before|hand,
that they would meet there with great choice of
any particular &s;pecies of commodity. This policy of in|viting
foreigners to Calais was carried &s;o far, that all
Engli&s;h merchants were prohibited by law from exporting
any Engli&s;h goods from the &s;taple; which was in a man|ner
the total abandoning all navigation, except that to
Calais<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">27 Edw. III. cap. 7.</NOTE>. A contrivance &s;eemingly very ab&s;urd and ex|traordinary.</P>
<P>LUXURY was complained of in that age, as well as in
others of more refinement; and attempts were made by
parliament to re&s;train it, particularly on the head of ap|parel,
where &s;urely it is the mo&s;t obviou&s;ly innocent and
inoffenfive. No man under an hundred a year was al|lowed
to wear gold, &s;ilver, or &s;ilk in his cloaths:
Servants al&s;o were prohibited from eating fle&s;h meat, or
fi&s;h, above once a day<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">37 Edw. III. cap. 8, 9, 10, &amp;c.</NOTE>. It was ea&s;y to fore&s;ee that
<PB N="514" REF="545">
&s;uch ridiculous laws mu&s;t prove ineffectual, and could
never be executed.</P>
<P>THE u&s;e of the French language, in pleadings and
public deeds, was aboli&s;hed<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">36 Edward III. cap. 15.</NOTE>. It may appear &s;trange,
that the nation &s;hould &s;o long have worn this badge of
conque&s;t. But the King and nobility &s;eem never to have
become thoroughly Engli&s;h, till Edward's wars with
France gave them an antipathy to that nation. Yet &s;till,
it was long before the u&s;e of the Engli&s;h tongue came
into fa&s;hion. The fir&s;t Engli&s;h paper which we meet
with in Rymer is in the year 1386, during the reign of
Richard II.<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. vii. p. 526. This paper, by the &s;tile, &s;eems to have been drawn by the Scots, and was &s;igned only by the wardens of the marches.</NOTE> There are Spani&s;h papers in that collec|tion
more antient<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. vi. p. 554.</NOTE>: And the u&s;e of the Latin and French
&s;till continued.</P>
<P>IN 1364, the commons petitioned, that in con&s;idera|tion
of the preceding pe&s;tilence, &s;uch per&s;ons as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
manors holding of the King in chief, and had let liferent
lea&s;es without obtaining licences, might continue to ex|erci&s;e
the &s;ame power, till the country was become more
populous<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. $7$</NOTE>. The commons were &s;en&s;ible, that this &s;e|curity
of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was a good means for rendering the
kingdom pro&s;perous and flouri&s;hing; yet dur&s;t not apply,
all at once, for a greater relaxation of their chains.</P>
<P>THERE is not a reign among tho&s;e of the antient Eng|li&s;h
monarchs, which de&s;erves more to be &s;tudied than
that of Edward III. nor one where the dome&s;tic tran&s;ac|tions
will better di&s;cover the true genius of that kind of
mixed government, which was then e&s;tabli&s;hed in Eng|land.
The &s;truggles, with regard to the validity and
authority of the great charter, were now over: The
King was acknowledged to lie under &s;ome limitations:
<PB N="515" REF="546">
Edward him&s;elf was a prince of great capacity, not go|verned
by favourites, nor led a&s;tray by any unruly pa&s;|&s;ion,
&s;en&s;ible that nothing could be more e&s;&s;ential to his
intere&s;ts than to keep on good terms with his people:
Yet on the whole it appears, that the government, at
be&s;t, was only a barbarous monarchy, not regulated by
any fixed maxims, nor bounded by any certain undi&s;|puted
rights, which were in practice regularly ob&s;erved.
The King conducted him&s;elf by one &s;et of principles;
the barons by another; the commons by a third; the
clergy by a fourth. All the&s;e &s;y&s;tems of government
were contrary and incompatible: Each of them prevailed
according as incidents were favourable to it: A great
prince rendered the monarchical power predominant:
The weakne&s;s of a King gave reins to the ari&s;tocracy:
A &s;uper&s;titious age &s;aw the clergy triumphant: The
people, for whom alone government was in&s;tituted, and
who alone de&s;erve con&s;ideration, were commonly the
weake&s;t of the whole. But the commons, little ob|noxious
to any other order; though they &s;unk under
the violence of tempe&s;ts, &s;ilently reared their head in
more peaceable times; and while the &s;torm was brewing,
were courted by all &s;ides, and thus received &s;till &s;ome
acce&s;&s;ion to their privileges, or, at wor&s;t, &s;ome confir|mation
of them.</P>
