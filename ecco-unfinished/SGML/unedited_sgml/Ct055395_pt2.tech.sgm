<HEAD>LETTER XXV.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Nice, <DATE>January 1, 1765.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT was in deference to your opinion, re|inforced
by my own inclination, and the
repeated advice of other friends, that I
re&s;olved upon my late excur&s;ion to Italy. I
could plainly perceive from the anxious &s;olli|citude,
and pre&s;&s;ing exhortations contained in
all the letters I had lately received from my
corre&s;pondents in Britain, that you had all
de&s;paired of my recovery. You advi&s;ed me
to make a pilgrimage among the Alps, and
the advice was good. In &s;crambling among
tho&s;e mountains, I &s;hould have benefited by
the exerci&s;e, and at the &s;ame time have
<PB N="2" REF="4">
breathed a cool, pure, &s;alubrious air, which,
in all probability, would have expelled the
&s;low fever ari&s;ing in a great mea&s;ure from the
heat of this climate. But, I wanted a com|panion
and fellow-traveller, who&s;e conver&s;a|tion
and &s;ociety could alleviate the horrors of
&s;olitude. Be&s;ides, I was not &s;trong enough
to encounter the want of conveniencies, and
even of nece&s;&s;aries to which I mu&s;t have been
expo&s;ed in the cour&s;e of &s;uch an expedition.
My worthy friend Dr. A&mdash;earne&s;tly in|treated
me to try the effect of a &s;ea-voyage,
which you know has been found of wonder|ful
effecacy in con&s;umptive ca&s;es. After &s;ome
deliberation, I re&s;olved upon the &s;cheme, which
I have now happily executed. I had a mo&s;t
eager curio&s;ity to &s;ee the antiquities of Flo|rence
and Rome: I longed impatiently to
view tho&s;e wonderful edifices, &s;tatues, and pic|tures,
which I had &s;o often admired in prints
and de&s;criptions. I felt an enthu&s;ia&s;tic ardor
to tread that very cla&s;&s;ical ground which had
been the &s;cene of &s;o many great atchieve|ments;
and I could not bear the thought of
returning to England from the very &s;kirts of
Italy, without having penetrated to the capi|tal
<PB N="3" REF="5">
of that renowned country. With regard
to my health, I knew I could manage mat|ters
&s;o as to enjoy all the benefits that could
be expected from the united energy of a
voyage by &s;ea, a journey by land, and a
change of climate.</P>
<P>Rome is betwixt four and five hundred
miles di&s;tant from Nice, and one half of the
way I was re&s;olved to travel by water. In|deed
there is no other way of going from hence
to Genoa, unle&s;s you take a mule, and clam|ber
along the mountains at the rate of two
miles an hour, and at the ri&s;que of breaking
your neck every minute. The Appenine
mountains, which are no other than a con|tinuation
of the maritime Alps, form an al|mo&s;t
continued precipice from Villefranche
to Lerici, which is almo&s;t forty-five miles on
the other &s;ide of Genoa; and as they are
generally wa&s;hed by the &s;ea, there is no beach
or &s;hore, con&s;equently the road is carried a|long
the face of the rocks, except at certain
&s;mall intervals, which are occupied by towns
and villages. But, as there is a road for
mules and foot pa&s;&s;engers, it might certainly
be enlarged and improved &s;o as to render it
<PB N="4" REF="6">
practicable by chai&s;es and other wheel-car|riages,
and a toll might be exacted, which in
a little time would defray the expence: for
certainly no per&s;on who travels to Italy, from
England, Holland, France, or Spain, would
make a trouble&s;ome circuit to pa&s;s the Alps by
the way of Savoy and Piedmont, if he could
have the convenience of going po&s;t by the
way of Aix, Antibes, and Nice, along the
&s;ide of the Mediterranean, and through the
Riviera of Genoa, which from the &s;ea affords
the mo&s;t agreeable and amazing pro&s;pect I ever
beheld. What pity it is, they cannot re&s;tore
the celebrated <HI>Via Aurelia,</HI> mentioned in the
Itinerarium of Antoninus, which extended
from Rome by the way of Genoa, and
through this country as far as Arles upon the
Rhone. It was &s;aid to have been made by
the emperor Marcus Aurelius; and &s;ome of
the ve&s;tiges of it are &s;till to be &s;een in Pro|vence.
The truth is, the nobility of Genoa,
who are all merchants, from a low, &s;elfi&s;h, and
ab&s;urd policy, take all methods to keep their
&s;ubjects of the Riviera in poverty and depen|dence.
With this view, they carefully avoid
all &s;teps towards rendering that country ac|ce&s;&s;ible
<PB N="5" REF="7">
by land; and at the &s;ame time di&s;|courage
their trade by &s;ea, le&s;t it &s;hould in|terfere
with the commerce of their capital,
in which they them&s;elves are per&s;onally con|cerned.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who either will not or cannot bear
the &s;ea, and are equally aver&s;e to riding, may
be carried in a common chair, provided with
a foot-board, on men's &s;houlders: this is the
way of travelling practi&s;ed by the ladies of
Nice, in cro&s;&s;ing the mountains to Turin;
but it is very tedious and expen&s;ive, as the
men mu&s;t be often relieved.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t agreeable carriage from hence to
Genoa, is a feluca, or open boat, rowed by
ten or twelve &s;tout mariners. Though none
of the&s;e boats belong to Nice, they are to be
found every day in our harbour, waiting for
a fare to Genoa; and they are &s;een pa&s;&s;ing
and repa&s;&s;ing continually, with merchandize
or pa&s;&s;engers, between Mar&s;eilles, Antibes,
and the Genoe&s;e territories. A feluca is large
enough to take in a po&s;t-chai&s;e; and there
is a tilt over the &s;tern-&s;heets, where the pa&s;|&s;engers
&s;it, to protect them from the rain:
between the &s;eats one per&s;on may lie commo|diou&s;ly
<PB N="6" REF="8">
upon a mattra&s;s, which is commonly
&s;upplied by the patron. A man in good
health may put up with any thing; but I
would advi&s;e every valetudinarian who travels
this way, to provide his own chai&s;e, mattra&s;s,
and bed-linnen, otherwi&s;e he will pa&s;s his
time very uncomfortably. If you go as a
&s;imple pa&s;&s;enger in a feluca, you pay about a
loui'dore for your place, and you mu&s;t be in|tirely
under the direction of the patron, who,
while he can bear the &s;ea, will pro&s;ecute his
voyage by night as well as by day, and expo&s;e
you to many other inconveniencies: but for
eight zequines, or four loui'dores, you can
have a whole feluca to your&s;elf, from Nice to
Genoa, and the ma&s;ter &s;hall be obliged to put
a &s;hore every evening. If you would have it
&s;till more at you command, you may hire it
at &s;o much per day and in that ca&s;e, go on
&s;hore as often, and &s;tay as long as you plea&s;e.
This is the method I &s;hould take, were I to
make the voyage again; for I am per&s;uaded
I &s;hould find it very near as cheap, and much
more agreeable than any other.</P>
<P>The di&s;tance between this place and Genoa,
when mea&s;ured on the carte, does not exceed
<PB N="7" REF="9">
ninety miles: but the people of the felucas
in&s;i&s;t upon its being one hundred and twenty.
If they creep along &s;hore round the bottoms
of all the bays, this computation may be true:
but, except when the &s;ea is rough, they &s;tretch
directly from one head-land to another, and
even when the wind is contrary, provided the
gale is not fre&s;h, they perform the voyage in
two days and a half, by dint of rowing:
when the wind is favourable, they will &s;ail
it ea&s;ily in fourteen hours.</P>
<P>A man, who has nothing but expedition in
view, may go with the courier, who has al|ways
a light boat well manned, and will be
glad to accommodate a traveller for a rea|&s;onable
gratification. I know an Engli&s;h
gentleman who always travels with the courier
in Italy, both by &s;ea and land. In po&s;ting
by land, he is always &s;ure of having part of
a good cala&s;h, and the be&s;t hor&s;es that can
be found; and as the expence of both is de|frayed
by the public, it co&s;ts him nothing
but a pre&s;ent to his companion, which does
not amount to one fourth part of the expence
he would incur by travelling alone. The&s;e
<PB N="8" REF="10">
opportunities may be had every week in all
the towns of Italy.</P>
<P>For my own part, I hired a gondola from
hence to Genoa. This is a boat &s;maller than
a feluca, rowed by four men, and &s;teered by
the patron; but the price was nine zequines,
rather more than I &s;hould have payed for a
feluca of ten oars. I was a&s;&s;ured that being
very light, it would make great way; and
the ma&s;ter was particularly recommended to
me, as an hone&s;t man and an able mariner. I
was accompanied in this voyage by my wife
and Mi&s;s C&mdash;, together with one Mr. R&mdash;,
a native of Nice, whom I treated with the
jaunt, in hopes that as he was acquainted
with the cu&s;toms of the country, and the
different ways of travelling in it, he would
&s;ave us much trouble, and &s;ome expence:
but I was much di&s;appointed. Some per&s;ons
at Nice offered to lay wagers that he would re|turn
by him&s;elf from Italy; but they were al&s;o
di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>We embarked in the beginning of Septem|ber,
attended by one &s;ervant. The heats,
which render travelling dangerous in Italy,
begin to abate at this &s;ea&s;on. The weather
<PB N="9" REF="11">
was extremely agreeable; and if I had po&s;t|poned
my voyage a little longer, I fore&s;aw
that I &s;hould not be able to return before
winter; in which ca&s;e I might have found
the &s;ea too rough, and the weather too cold
for a voyage of one hundred and thirty-five
miles in an open boat.</P>
<P>Having therefore provided my&s;elf with a
proper pa&s;s, &s;igned and &s;ealed by our con&s;ul,
as well as with letters of recommendation
from him to the Engli&s;h con&s;uls at Genoa
and Leghorn, a precaution which I would
advi&s;e all travellers to take, in ca&s;e of meet|ing
with accidents on the road, we went on
board about ten in the morning, &s;topped a|bout
half an hour at a friend's country-hou&s;e
in the bay of St. Ho&s;pice, and about noon
entered the harbour of Monaco, where the
patron was obliged to pay toll, according to
the regulation which I have explained in a
former letter. This &s;mall town, containing
about eight or nine hundred &s;ouls, be&s;ides the
garri&s;on, is built on a rock which projects
into the &s;ea, and makes a very romantic ap|pearance.
The prince's palace &s;tands in the
mo&s;t con&s;picuous part, with a walk of trees
<PB N="10" REF="12">
before it. The apartments are elegantly fur|ni&s;hed,
and adorned with &s;ome good pictures.
The fortifications are in good repair, and the
place is garri&s;oned by two French battalions.
The pre&s;ent prince of Monaco is a Frenchman,
&s;on of the duke de Matignon, who married
the heire&s;s of Monaco, who&s;e name was
Grimaldi. The harbour is well &s;heltered
from the wind; but has not water &s;ufficient
to admit ve&s;&s;els of any great burthen. To|wards
the north, the king of Sardinia's terri|tories
extend to within a mile of the gate;
but the prince of Monaco can go upon his
own ground along &s;hore about five or &s;ix
miles to the ea&s;tward, as far as Menton, ano|ther
&s;mall town, which al&s;o belongs to him,
and is &s;ituated on the &s;ea-&s;ide. His revenues
are computed at a million of French livres,
amounting to &s;omething more than forty
thou&s;and pounds &s;terling: but, the princi|pality
of Monaco, con&s;i&s;ting of three &s;mall
towns, and an incon&s;iderable tract of barren
rock, is not worth above &s;even thou&s;and a
year; the re&s;t ari&s;es from his French e&s;tate.
This con&s;i&s;ts partly of the dutchy of Matig|non,
and partly of the duchy of Valentinois,
<PB N="11" REF="13">
which la&s;t was given to the ance&s;tors of this
prince of Monaco, in the year 1640, by the
French king, to make up the lo&s;s of &s;ome
lands in the kingdom of Naples, which were
confi&s;cated when he expelled the Spani&s;h garri|on
from Monaco, and threw him&s;elf into the
arms of France: &s;o that he is duke of Valen|tinois
as well as of Matignon, in that king|dom.
He lives almo&s;t con&s;tantly in France;
and has taken the name and arms of Gri|maldi.</P>
<P>The Genoe&s;e territories begin at Ventimig|lia,
another town lying on the coa&s;t, at the
di&s;tance of twenty miles from Nice, a cir|cum&s;tance
from which it borrows the name.
Having pa&s;&s;ed the towns of Monaco, Menton,
Ventimiglia, and &s;everal other places of le&s;s
con&s;equence that lie along this coa&s;t, we turn|ed
the point of St. Martin with a favourable
breeze, and might have proceeded twenty miles
further before night: but the women began
to be &s;ick, as well as afraid at the roughne&s;s
of the water; Mr. R&mdash;was &s;o di&s;com|po&s;ed,
that he privately de&s;ired the patron to
put a&s;hore at St. Remo, on pretence that we
&s;hould not find a tolerable auberge in any
<PB N="12" REF="14">
other place between this and Noli, which was
at the di&s;tance of forty miles. We accord|ingly
landed, and were conducted to the po&s;te,
which our gondeliere a&s;&s;ured us was the be&s;t
auberge in the whole Riviera of Genoa. We
a&s;cended by a dark, narrow, &s;teep &s;tair, into
a kind of public room, with a long table
and benches, &s;o dirty and mi&s;erable, that
it would di&s;grace the wor&s;t hedge ale-hou&s;e
in England. Not a &s;oul appeared to receive
us. This is a ceremony one mu&s;t not expect
to meet with in France; far le&s;s in Italy.
Our patron going into the kitchen, a&s;ked a
&s;ervant if the company could have lodging
in the hou&s;e; and was an&s;wered, &startq;he could
not tell: the patron was not at home.&endq; When
he de&s;ired to know where the patron was, the
other an&s;wered, &startq;he was gone to take the
air.&endq; <HI>E andato a pa&s;&s;eggiare.</HI> In the mean
time, we were obliged to &s;it in the common
room among watermen and muleteers. At
length the landlord arrived, and gave us to
under&s;tand, that he could accommodate us
with chambers. In that where I lay, there
was ju&s;t room for two beds, without curtains
or bed&s;tead, an old rotten table covered with
<PB N="13" REF="15">
dried figs, and a couple of crazy chairs.
The walls had been once white-wa&s;hed: but
were now hung with cobwebs, and &s;peckled
with dirt of all forts; and I believe the brick|floor
had not been &s;wept for half a century.
We &s;upped in an outward room &s;uitable in
all re&s;pects to the chamber, and fared vil|lainou&s;ly.
The provi&s;ion was very ill-dre&s;&s;ed,
and &s;erved up in the mo&s;t &s;lovenly manner.
You mu&s;t not expect cleanline&s;s or conve|niency
of any kind in this country. For
this accommodation I payed as much as if I
had been elegantly entertained in the be&s;t au|berge
of France or Italy.</P>
<P>Next day, the wind was &s;o high that we
could not pro&s;ecute our voyage, &s;o that we
were obliged to pa&s;s other four and twenty
hours in this comfortable &s;ituation. Luck|ily
Mr. R&mdash;found two acquaintances in
the place; one a Franci&s;can monk, a jolly
fellow; and the other a <HI>mae&s;tro di capella,</HI>
who &s;ent a &s;pinnet to the inn, and enter|tained
us agreeably with his voice and per|formance,
in both of which accompli&s;hments
he excelled. The padre was very good hu|moured,
and favoured us with a letter of re|commendation
<PB N="14" REF="16">
to a friend of his, a profe&s;&s;or
in the univer&s;ity of Pi&s;a. You would laugh
to &s;ee the hyperbolical terms in which he
mentioned your humble &s;ervant: but Italy is
the native country of hyperbole.</P>
<P>St. Remo is a pretty con&s;iderable town,
well-built upon the declivity of a gently ri&s;ing
hill, and has a harbour capable of receiving
&s;mall ve&s;&s;els, a good number of which are
built upon the beach: but &s;hips of any
burden are obliged to anchor in the bay,
which is far from being &s;ecure. The people
of St. Remo form a &s;mall republic, which is
&s;ubject to Genoa. They enjoyed particular
privileges, till the year 1753, when in con&s;e|quence
of a new gabelle upon &s;alt, they re|volted:
but this effort in behalf of liberty
did not &s;ucceed. They were &s;oon reduced
by the Genoe&s;e, who deprived them of all their
privileges, and built a fort by the &s;ea-&s;ide,
which &s;erves the double purpo&s;e of defend|ing
the harbour and over-awing the town.
The garri&s;on at pre&s;ent does not exceed two
hundred men. The inhabitants are &s;aid to
have lately &s;ent a deputation to Rati&s;bon, to
crave the protection of the diet of the empire.
<PB N="15" REF="17">
There is very little plain ground in this
neighbourhood; but the hills are covered
with oranges, lemons, pomegranates, and
olives, which produce a con&s;iderable traffic
in fine fruit and excellent oil. The women
of St. Remo are much more hand&s;ome and
better tempered than tho&s;e of Provence. They
have in general good eyes, with open inge|nuous
countenances. Their dre&s;s, though
remarkable, I cannot de&s;cribe; but upon the
whole, they put me in mind of &s;ome por|traits
I have &s;een, repre&s;enting the females of
Georgia and Mingrelia.</P>
<P>On the third day, the wind being abated,
though &s;till unfavourable, we reimbarked and
rowed along &s;hore, pa&s;&s;ing by Porto-mauricio,
and Oneglia; then turning the promontory
called Capo di Melle, we proceeded by Al|benga,
Finale, and many other places of in|ferior
note. Porto-mauricio is &s;eated on a rock
wa&s;hed by the &s;ea, but indifferently fortified,
with an incon&s;iderable harbour, which none
but very &s;mall ve&s;&s;els can enter. About two
miles to the ea&s;tward is Oneglia, a &s;mall
town with &s;ome fortifications, lying along the
open beach, and belonging to the king of
<PB N="16" REF="18">
Sardinia. This &s;mall territory abounds with
olive-trees, which produce a con&s;iderable quan|tity
of oil, counted the be&s;t of the whole Ri|viera.
Albenga is a &s;mall town, the &s;ee of a
bi&s;hop, &s;uffragan to the archbi&s;hop of Genoa.
It lies upon the &s;ea, and the country produces
a great quantity of hemp. Finale is the
capital of a marqui&s;ate belonging to the
Genoe&s;e, which has been the &s;ource of much
trouble to the republic; and indeed was the
&s;ole cau&s;e of their rupture with the king of
Sardinia and the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria in the year
1745. The town is pretty well built; but the
harbour is &s;hallow, open, and un&s;afe: never|thele&s;s,
they build a good number of tartans
and other ve&s;&s;els on the beach; and the
neighbouring country abounds with oil and
fruit, particularly with tho&s;e excellent apples
called <HI>pomi carli,</HI> which I have mentioned in
a former letter.</P>
<P>In the evening we reached the Capo di
Noli, counted very dangerous in blowing
weather. It is a very high perpendicular
rock or mountain wa&s;hed by the &s;ea, which
has eaten into it in divers places, &s;o as to
form a great number of caverns. It extends
<PB N="17" REF="19">
about a couple of miles, and in &s;ome parts
is indented into little creeks or bays, where
there is a narrow margin of &s;andy beach be|tween
it and the water. When the wind is
high, no feluca will attempt to pa&s;s it; even
in a moderate breeze, the waves da&s;hing
again&s;t the rocks and caverns, which echo
with the &s;ound, make &s;uch an awful noi&s;e,
and at the &s;ame time occa&s;ion &s;uch a rough
&s;ea, as one cannot hear, and &s;ee, and feel,
without a &s;ecret horror.</P>
<P>On this &s;ide of the Cape, there is a beau|tiful
&s;trand cultivated like a garden; the plan|tations
extend to the very tops of the hills,
inter&s;per&s;ed with villages, ca&s;tles, churches,
and villas. Indeed the whole Riviera is orna|mented
in the &s;ame manner, except in &s;uch
places as admit of no building nor cultiva|tion.</P>
<P>Having pa&s;&s;ed the Cape, we followed the
winding of the coa&s;t, into a &s;mall bay, and
arrived at the town of Noli, where we pro|po&s;ed
to pa&s;s the night. You will be &s;ur|prized
that we did not go a&s;hore &s;ooner, in
order to take &s;ome refre&s;hment; but the
truth is, we had a provi&s;ion of ham, tongues,
<PB N="18" REF="20">
roa&s;ted pullets, chee&s;e, bread, wine, and fruit,
in the feluca, where we every day enjoyed
a &s;light repa&s;t about one or two o'clock in the
afternoon. This I mention as a nece&s;&s;ary piece
of information to tho&s;e who may be inclined
to follow the &s;ame route. We likewi&s;e found
it convenient to lay in &s;tore of <HI>l'eau de vie,</HI> or
brandy, for the u&s;e of the rowers, who always
expect to &s;hare your comforts. On a meagre
day, however, tho&s;e ragamuffins will rather
die of hunger than &s;uffer the lea&s;t mor&s;el of
fle&s;h-meat to enter their mouths. I have
frequently tried the experiment, by pre&s;&s;ing
them to eat &s;omething <HI>gras,</HI> on a Friday or
Saturday: but they always declined it with
marks of abhorrence, crying, <HI>Dio me ne libere!</HI>
God deliver me from it! or &s;ome other words
to that effect. I moreover ob&s;erved, that not
one of tho&s;e fellows ever &s;wore an oath, or
&s;poke an indecent word. They would by no
means put to &s;ea, of a morning, before they
had heard ma&s;s; and when the wind was un|favourable,
they always &s;et out with a hymn
to the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, or St. Elmo, keeping
time with their oars as they &s;ung. I have in|deed
remarked all over this country, that a
<PB N="19" REF="21">
man who tran&s;gre&s;&s;es the in&s;titutions of the
church in the&s;e &s;mall matters, is much more
infamous than one who has committed the
mo&s;t flagrant crimes again&s;t nature and mora|lity.
A murderer, adulterer, or &s;&mdash;m&mdash;te,
will obtain ea&s;y ab&s;olution from the church,
and even find favour with &s;ociety; but a man
who eats a pidgeon on a Saturday, without
expre&s;s licence, is avoided and abhorred, as a
mon&s;ter of reprobation. I have conver&s;ed
with &s;everal intelligent per&s;ons on the &s;ubject;
and have rea&s;on to believe, that a delinquent of
this &s;ort is con&s;idered as a luke-warm catho|lic,
little better than a heretic; and of all
crimes they look upon here&s;y as the mo&s;t
damnable.</P>
<P>Noli is a &s;mall republic of fi&s;hermen &s;ub|ject
to Genoa; but very tenacious of their
privileges. The town &s;tands on the beach,
tolerably well built, defended by a ca&s;tle &s;i|tuated
on a rock above it; and the harbour
is of little con&s;equence. The auberge was
&s;uch as made us regret even the inn we had
left at St. Remo. After a very odd kind of
&s;upper, which I cannot pretend to de&s;cribe,
we retired to our repo&s;e: but I had not been
<PB N="20" REF="22">
in bed five minutes, when I felt &s;omething
crawling on different parts of my body, and
taking a light to examine, perceived above a
dozen large bugs. You mu&s;t know I have
the &s;ame kind of antipathy to the&s;e vermin,
that &s;ome per&s;ons have to a cat or brea&s;t of
veal. I &s;tarted up immediately, and wrap|ping
my&s;elf in a great coat, &s;ick as I was,
laid down in the outer room upon a che&s;t,
where I continued till morning.</P>
<P>One would imagine that in a mountainous
country like this, there &s;hould be plenty of
goats; and indeed, we &s;aw many flocks of
them feeding among the rocks, yet we could
not procure half a pint of milk for our tea,
if we had given the weight of it in gold.
The people here have no idea of u&s;ing milk,
and when you a&s;k them for it, they &s;tand
gaping with a fooli&s;h face of &s;urprize, which
is exceedingly provoking. It is amazing that
in&s;tinct does not teach the pea&s;ants to feed
their children with goat's milk, &s;o much more
nouri&s;hing and agreeable than the wretched
&s;u&s;tenance on which they live. Next day we
rowed by Vado and Savona, which la&s;t is a
large town, with a &s;trong citadel, and a har|bour,
<PB N="21" REF="23">
which was formerly capable of receiv|ing
large &s;hips: but it fell a &s;acrifice to the
jealou&s;y of the Genoe&s;e, who have partly
choaked it up, on pretence that it &s;hould not
afford &s;helter to the &s;hips of war belonging
to tho&s;e &s;tates which might be at enmity with
the republic.</P>
<P>Then we pa&s;&s;ed Albi&s;ola, Se&s;tri di Ponente,
Novi, Voltri, and a great number of vil|lages,
villas, and magnificent palaces belong|ing
to the Genoe&s;e nobility, which form al|mo&s;t
a continued chain of buildings along the
&s;trand for thirty miles.</P>
<P>About five in the afternoon, we &s;kirted the
fine &s;uburbs of St. Petro D'arena, and arrived
at Genoa, which makes a dazzling appear|ance
when viewed from the &s;ea, ri&s;ing like
an amphitheatre in a circular form, from the
water's edge, a con&s;iderable way up the moun|tains,
and &s;urrounded on the land &s;ide by a
double wall, the mo&s;t exterior of which is &s;aid
to extend fifteen miles in circuit. The fir&s;t
object that &s;trikes your eye at a di&s;tance, is a
very elegant pharos, or light-hou&s;e, built on
the projection of a rock on the we&s;t &s;ide of
the harbour, &s;o very high, that, in a clear
<PB N="22" REF="24">
day, you may &s;ee it at the di&s;tance of thirty
miles. Turning the light-hou&s;e point, you
find your&s;elf clo&s;e to the mole, which forms the
harbour of Genoa. It is built at a great ex|pence
from each &s;ide of the bay, &s;o as to form
in the &s;ea two long magnificent jettes, which
if continued, would meet. At the extremity
of each is another &s;maller lanthorn. The&s;e
moles are both provided with bra&s;s-cannon,
and between them is the entrance into the
harbour. But this is &s;till &s;o wide as to admit
a great &s;ea, which, when the wind blows hard
from &s;outh and &s;outh we&s;t, is very trouble|&s;ome
to the &s;hipping. Within the mole there
is a &s;maller harbour or wet dock, called <HI>Dar|&s;ena,</HI>
for the gallies of the republic. We
pa&s;&s;ed through a con&s;iderable number of
&s;hips and ve&s;&s;els lying at anchor, and landing
at the water-gate, repaired to an inn called
<HI>La Croix de Malthe,</HI> in the neighbourhood
of the harbour. Here we met with &s;uch
good entertainment as prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed us in fa|vour
of the interior parts of Italy, and con|tributed
with other motives to detain us &s;ome
days in this city. But, I have detained you
&s;o long, that I believe you wi&s;h I may pro|ceed
<PB N="23" REF="25">
no farther; and therefore I take my
leave for the pre&s;ent, being very &s;incerely,</P>
<CLOSER>Yours.</CLOSER>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVI.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Nice, <DATE>January 15, 1765.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is not without rea&s;on that Genoa is
called <HI>La &s;uperba.</HI> The city it&s;elf is very
&s;tately; and the nobles are very proud. Some
few of them may be proud of their wealth:
but, in general, their fortunes are very &s;mall.
My friend Mr. R&mdash;a&s;&s;ured me that many
Genoe&s;e noblemen had fortunes of half a
million of livres <HI>per annum:</HI> but the truth is,
the whole revenue of the &s;tate does not ex|ceed
this &s;um; and the livre of Genoa is but
about nine pence &s;terling. There are about
half a dozen of their nobles who have ten
thou&s;and a year: but the majority have not
above a twentieth part of that &s;um. They
live with great par&s;imony in their families;
<PB N="24" REF="26">
and wear nothing but black in public; &s;o
that their expences are but &s;mall. If a
Genoe&s;e nobleman gives an entertainment
once a quarter, he is &s;aid to live upon the
fragments all the re&s;t of the year. I was
told that one of them lately treated his friends,
and left the entertainment to the care of his
&s;on, who ordered a di&s;h of fi&s;h that co&s;t a
zechine, which is equal to about ten &s;hil|lings
&s;terling. The old gentleman no &s;ooner
&s;aw it appear on the table, than unable to
&s;uppre&s;s his concern, he bur&s;t into tears, and
exclaimed, <HI>Ab Figliuolo indegno! Siamo in
Rovina! Siamo in precipizio!</HI></P>
<P>I think the pride or o&s;tentation of the
Italians in general takes a more laudable turn
than that of other nations. A Frenchman lays
out his whole revenue upon tawdry &s;uits of
cloaths, or in furni&s;hing a magnificent <HI>repas</HI>
of fifty or a hundred di&s;hes, one half of
which are not eatable, nor intended to be
eaten. His wardrobe goes to the <HI>fripier;</HI>
his di&s;hes to the dogs, and him&s;elf to the
devil, and after his decea&s;e no ve&s;tige of him
remains. A Genoe&s;e, on the other hand,
keeps him&s;elf and his family at &s;hort allow|ance,
<PB N="25" REF="27">
that he may &s;ave money to build palaces
and churches, which remain to after-ages &s;o
many monuments of his ta&s;te, piety, and
munificence; and in the mean time give em|ployment
and bread to the poor and in|du&s;trious.
There are &s;ome Genoe&s;e nobles
who have each five or &s;ix elegant palaces mag|nificently
furni&s;hed, either in the city, or in
different parts of the Riviera. The two
&s;treets called <HI>Strada Balbi</HI> and <HI>Strada Nuova,</HI>
are continued double ranges of palaces a|dorned
with gardens and fountains: but
their being painted on the out&s;ide has, in
my opinion, a poor effect.</P>
<P>The commerce of this city is, at pre&s;ent,
not very con&s;iderable; yet it has the face of
bu&s;ine&s;s. The &s;treets are crouded with peo|ple;
the &s;hops are well furni&s;hed; and the
markets abound with all &s;orts of excellent
provi&s;ion. The wine made in this neigh|bourhood
is, however, very indifferent; and
all that is con&s;umed mu&s;t be bought at the
public cantinre, where it is &s;old for the bene|fit
of the &s;tate. Their bread is the white&s;t
and the be&s;t I have ta&s;ted any where; and
the beef, which they have from Piedmont, is
<PB N="26" REF="28">
juicy and delicious. The expence of eating
in Italy is nearly the &s;ame as in France,
about three &s;hillings a head for every meal.
The &s;tate of Genoa is very poor, and their
bank of St. George has received &s;uch rude
&s;hocks, fir&s;t from the revolt of the Cor&s;icans,
and afterwards from the misfortunes of the
city, when it was taken by the Au&s;trians in
the war of 1745, that it &s;till continues to
langui&s;h without any near pro&s;pect of its
credit being re&s;tored. Nothing &s;hews the
weakne&s;s of their &s;tate, more than their
having recour&s;e to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of France to
put a &s;top to the progre&s;s of Paoli in Cor&s;ica;
for after all that has been &s;aid of the gal|lantry
and courage of Paoli and his i&s;landers,
I am very credibly informed that they might
be very ea&s;ily &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, if the Genoe&s;e had
either vigour in the council or re&s;olution in
the field.</P>
<P>True it is, they made a noble effort in ex|pelling
the Au&s;trians who had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of their city; but this effort was the effect of
oppre&s;&s;ion and de&s;pair, and if I may believe
the in&s;inuations of &s;ome politicians in this
part of the world, the Genoe&s;e would not
<PB N="27" REF="29">
have &s;ucceeded in that attempt, if they had
not previou&s;ly purcha&s;ed with a large &s;um of
money the connivance of the only per&s;on who
could defeat the enterprize. For my own
part, I can &s;carce entertain thoughts &s;o pre|judicial
to the character of human nature, as
to &s;uppo&s;e a man capable of &s;acrificing to
&s;uch a con&s;ideration, the duty he owed his
prince, as well as all regard to the lives of
his &s;oldiers, even tho&s;e who lay &s;ick in ho&s;|pitals,
and who being dragged forth, were
mi&s;erably butchered by the furious populace.
There is one more pre&s;umption of his inno|cence,
he &s;till retains the favour of his &s;ove|reign,
who could not well be &s;uppo&s;ed to
&s;hare in the booty. &startq;There are my&s;teries in
politics which were never dreamed of in our
philo&s;ophy, Horatio!&endq; The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Ge|noa
might have proved a trouble&s;ome bone
of contention, which it might be convenient
to lo&s;e by accident. Certain it is, when the
Au&s;trians returned after their expul&s;ion, in
order to retake the city, the engineer, being
que&s;tioned by the general, declared he would
take the place in fifteen days, on pain of
lo&s;ing his head; and in four days after this
<PB N="28" REF="30">
declaration the Au&s;trians retired. This anec|dote
I learned from a worthy gentleman of
this country, who had it from the engineer's
own mouth. Perhaps it was the will of
heaven. You &s;ee how favourably providence
has interpo&s;ed in behalf of the reigning em|pre&s;s
of Ru&s;&s;ia, fir&s;t in removing her hu&s;band;
&s;econdly in ordaining the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of
prince Ivan, for which the perpetrators have
been &s;o liberally rewarded; it even &s;eems
determined to &s;horten the life of her own
&s;on, the only &s;urviving rival from whom &s;he
had any thing to fear.</P>
<P>The Genoe&s;e have now thrown them&s;elves
into the arms of France for protection: I
know not whether it would not have been a
greater mark of &s;agacity to cultivate the
friend&s;hip of England, with which they carry
on an advantageous commerce. While the
Engli&s;h are ma&s;ters of the Mediterranean,
they will always have it in their power to do
incredible damage all along the Riviera, to
ruin the Genoe&s;e trade by &s;ea, and even to
annoy the capital; for notwith&s;tanding all
the pains they have taken to fortify the mole
and the city, I am greatly deceived if it is not
<PB N="29" REF="31">
&s;till expo&s;ed to the danger, not only of a
bombardment, but even of a cannonade. I am
even &s;anguine enough to think a re&s;olute
commander might, with a &s;trong &s;quadron,
fail directly into the harbour, without &s;u&s;|taining
much damage, notwith&s;tanding all
the cannon of the place, which are &s;aid to
amount to near five hundred. I have &s;een a
cannonade of above four hundred pieces of
artillery, be&s;ides bombs and cohorns, main|tained
for many hours, without doing much
mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>During the la&s;t &s;iege of Genoa, the French
auxiliaries were obliged to wait at Monaco,
until a gale of wind had driven the Engli&s;h
&s;quadron off the coa&s;t, and then they went
along &s;hore in &s;mall ve&s;&s;els at the imminent
ri&s;que of being taken by the Briti&s;h crui&s;ers.
By land I apprehend their march would be
altogether impracticable, if the king of Sar|dinia
had any intere&s;t to oppo&s;e it. He
might either guard the pa&s;&s;es, or break up
the road in twenty different places, &s;o as to
render it altogether impa&s;&s;able. Here it may
not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve, that when Don Philip
advanced from Nice with his army to Genoa,
<PB N="30" REF="32">
he was obliged to march &s;o clo&s;e to the &s;hore,
that in above fifty different places, the Engli&s;h
&s;hips might have rendered the road altogether
impa&s;&s;able. The path, which runs generally
along the face of a precipice wa&s;hed by the
&s;ea, is &s;o narrow that two men on hor&s;eback
can hardly pa&s;s each other; and the road it|&s;elf
&s;o rugged, &s;lippery, and dangerous, that
the troopers were obliged to di&s;mount, and
lead their hor&s;es one by one. On the other
hand, baron de Leutrum, who was at the
head of a large body of Piedmonte&s;e troops,
had it in his power to block up the pa&s;&s;es of
the mountains, and even to de&s;troy this road
in &s;uch a manner, that the enemy could not
po&s;&s;ibly advance. Why the&s;e precautions
were not taken, I do not pretend to explain:
neither can I tell you wherefore the prince of
Monaco, who is a &s;ubject and partizan of
France, was indulged with a neutrality for
his town, which &s;erved as a refre&s;hing-place,
a &s;afe port, and an intermediate po&s;t for the
French &s;uccours &s;ent from Mar&s;eilles to Ge|noa.
This I will only venture to affirm, that
the &s;ucce&s;s and advantage of great alliances
are often &s;acrificed to low, partial, &s;elfi&s;h, and
<PB N="31" REF="33">
&s;ordid con&s;iderations. The town of Monaco
is commanded by every heighth in its neigh|bourhood;
and might be laid in a&s;hes by a
bomb-ketch in four hours by &s;ea.</P>
<P>I was fortunate enough to be recommended
to a lady in Genoa, who treated us with great
politene&s;s and ho&s;pitality. She introduced
me to an <HI>abbate,</HI> a man of letters, who&s;e
conver&s;ation was extremely agreeable. He
already knew me by reputation, and offered
to make me known to &s;ome of the fir&s;t per|&s;ons
in the republic, with whom he lived in
intimacy. The lady is one of the mo&s;t in|telligent
and be&s;t-bred per&s;ons I have known
in any country. We a&s;&s;i&s;ted at her conver|&s;azione,
which was numerous. She pre&s;&s;ed us
to pa&s;s the winter at Genoa; and indeed I
was almo&s;t per&s;uaded: but I had attach|ments
at Nice, from which I could not ea|&s;ily
di&s;engage my&s;elf.</P>
<P>The few days we &s;tayed at Genoa were
employed in vi&s;iting the mo&s;t remarkable
churches and palaces. In &s;ome of the
churches, particularly that of the <HI>Annunciata,</HI>
I found a profu&s;ion of ornaments, which had
more magnificence than ta&s;te. There is a
<PB N="32" REF="34">
great number of pictures; but very few of
them are capital pieces. I had heard much
of the <HI>ponte Carignano,</HI> which did not at all
an&s;wer my expectation. It is a bridge that
unites two eminences which form the higher
part of the city, and the hou&s;es in the bottom
below do not ri&s;e &s;o high as the &s;pringing of
its arches. There is nothing at all curious
in its con&s;truction, nor any way remarkable,
except the heighth of the piers from which
the arches are &s;prung. Hard by the bridge
there is an elegant church, from the top of
which you have a very rich and exten&s;ive
pro&s;pect of the city, the &s;ea and the adjacent
country, which looks like a continent of
groves and villas. The only remarkable cir|cum&s;tance
about the cathedral, which is Go|thic
and gloomy, is the chapel where the
pretended bones of John the Bapti&s;t are de|po&s;ited,
and in which thirty &s;ilver lamps are
continually burning. I had a curio&s;ity to &s;ee
the palaces of Durazzo and Doria, but it re|quired
more trouble to procure admi&s;&s;ion than
I was willing to give my&s;elf: as for the ar&s;e|nal,
and the ro&s;trum of an ancient galley
which was found by accident in dragging
<PB N="33" REF="35">
the harbour, I po&s;tponed &s;eeing them till my
return.</P>
<P>Having here provided my&s;elf with letters
of credit for Florence and Rome, I hired the
&s;ame boat which had brought us hither, to
carry us forward to Lerici, which is a &s;mall
town about half way between Genoa and Leg|horn,
where travellers, who are tired of the
&s;ea, take po&s;t-chai&s;es to continue their route
by land to Pi&s;a and Florence. I payed three
loui'dores for this voyage of about fifty
miles; though I might have had a feluca
for le&s;s money. When you land on the
wharf at Genoa, you are plied by the feluca
men ju&s;t as you are plied by the watermen at
Hungerford-&s;tairs in London. They are al|ways
ready to &s;et off at a minute's warning
for Lerici, Leghorn, Nice, Antibes, Mar|&s;eilles,
and every part of the Riviera.</P>
<P>The wind being &s;till unfavourable, though
the weather was delightful, we rowed along
&s;hore, pa&s;&s;ing by &s;everal pretty towns, vil|lages,
and a va&s;t number of <HI>ca&s;&s;ines,</HI> or little
white hou&s;es, &s;cattered among woods of olive
trees, that cover the hills; and the&s;e are the
habitations of the velvet and dama&s;k weavers.
<PB N="34" REF="36">
Turning Capo Fino we entered a bay, where
&s;tand the towns of Porto Fino, Lavagna, and
Se&s;tri di Levante, at which la&s;t we took up
our night's lodging. The hou&s;e was tolera|ble,
and we had no great rea&s;on to complain
of the beds: but, the weather being hot,
there was a very offen&s;ive &s;mell, which pro|ceeded
from &s;ome &s;kins of bea&s;ts new killed,
that were &s;pread to dry on an out-hou&s;e in
the yard. Our landlord was a butcher, and
had very much the looks of an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in. His
wife was a great ma&s;culine virago, who had
all the air of having frequented the &s;laughter-hou&s;e.
In&s;tead of being welcomed with looks
of complai&s;ance, we were admitted with a &s;ort
of gloomy conde&s;cen&s;ion, which &s;eemed to &s;ay,
&startq;We don't much like your company; but,
however, you &s;hall have a night's lodging in
favour of the <HI>patron of the gondola,</HI> who is
our acquaintance.&endq; In &s;hort, we had a very
bad &s;upper, mi&s;erably dre&s;&s;ed, pa&s;&s;ed a very
di&s;agreeable night, and payed a very extrava|gant
bill in the morning, without being
thanked for our cu&s;tom. I was very glad to get
out of the hou&s;e with my throat uncut.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="37">
Se&s;tri di Levante is a little town plea&s;antly
&s;ituated on the &s;ea-&s;ide; but has not the conve|niency
of a harbour. The fi&s;h taken here is mo&s;t|ly
carried to Genoa. This is likewi&s;e the mar|ket
for their oil, and the pa&s;te called <HI>macaroni,</HI>
of which they make a good quantity.</P>
<P>Next day, we &s;kirted a very barren coa&s;t,
con&s;i&s;ting of almo&s;t perpendicular rocks, on
the faces of which, however, we &s;aw many
pea&s;ants hou&s;es and hanging terraces for
vines, made by dint of incredible labour. In
the afternoon, we entered by the Porto di
Venere into the bay, or gulf of Spetia or
Spezza, which was the Portus Lunae of the
ancients. This bay, at the mouth of which
lies the i&s;land Palmaria, forms a mo&s;t noble
and &s;ecure harbour, capacious enough to
contain all the navies in Chri&s;tendom. The
entrance on one &s;ide is defended by a &s;mall
fort built above the town of Porto Venere,
which is a very poor place. Farther in there
is a battery of about twenty guns; and on
the right hand, oppo&s;ite to Porto Venere, is a
block-hou&s;e, founded on a rock in the &s;ea.
At the bottom of the bay is the town of
Spetia on the left, and on the right that of
<PB N="36" REF="38">
Lerici, defended by a ca&s;tle of very little
&s;trength or con&s;equence. The whole bay is
&s;urrounded with plantations of olives and
oranges, and makes a very delightful appear|ance.
In ca&s;e of a war, this would be an admi|rable
&s;tation for a Briti&s;h &s;quadron, as it lies &s;o
near Genoa and Leghorn; and has a double
entrance, by means of which the crui&s;ers could
&s;ail in and out continually, which way &s;oever
the wind might chance to &s;it. I am &s;ure the
fortifications would give very little di&s;turbance.</P>
<P>At the po&s;t-hou&s;e in Lerici, the accom|modation
is intolerable. We were almo&s;t
poi&s;oned at &s;upper. I found the place where
I was to lie &s;o clo&s;e and confined, that I could
not breathe in it, and therefore lay all night
in an outward room upon four chairs, with
a leather portmanteau for my pillow. For
this entertainment I payed very near a loui'dore.
Such bad accommodation is the le&s;s excu&s;able,
as the fellow has a great deal of bu&s;ine&s;s, this
being a great thoroughfare for travellers going
into Italy, or returning from thence.</P>
<P>I might have &s;aved &s;ome money by pro|&s;ecuting
my voyage directly by &s;ea to Leg|horn:
but, by this time, we were all heartily
<PB N="37" REF="39">
tired of the water: the bu&s;ine&s;s then was to
travel by land to Florence, by the way of Pi&s;a,
which is &s;even po&s;ts di&s;tant from Lerici. Tho&s;e
who have not their own carriage mu&s;t either
hire chai&s;es to perform the whole journey, or
travel by way of <HI>cambiatura,</HI> which is that of
changing the chai&s;es every po&s;t, as the cu&s;tom
is in England. In this ca&s;e the great incon|venience
ari&s;es from your being obliged to
&s;hift your baggage every po&s;t. The chai&s;e or
<HI>cale&s;&s;e</HI> of this country, is a wretched machine
with two wheels, as unea&s;y as a common cart,
being indeed no other than what we &s;hould
call in England a very ill-contrived one-hor&s;e
chair, narrow, naked, &s;hattered and &s;habby.
For this vehicle and two hor&s;es you pay at
the rate of eight <HI>paoli</HI> a &s;tage, or four &s;hillings
&s;terling; and the po&s;tilion expects two <HI>paoli</HI> for
his gratification: &s;o that every eight miles
co&s;t about five &s;hillings, and four only, if you
travel in your own carriage, as in that ca&s;e
you pay no more than at the rate of three
<HI>paoli</HI> a hor&s;e.</P>
<P>About three miles from Lerici, we cro&s;&s;ed
the Magra, which appeared as a rivulet almo&s;t
dry, and in half a mile farther arrived at Sar|zana,
<PB N="38" REF="40">
a &s;mall town at the extremity of the
Genoe&s;e territories, where we changed hor&s;es.
Then entering the principalities of Ma&s;&s;a and
Carrara, belonging to the duke of Modena,
we pa&s;&s;ed Lavenza, which &s;eems to be a de|cayed
town with a &s;mall garri&s;on, and dined
at Ma&s;&s;a, which is an agreeable little town,
where the old dutche&s;s of Modena re&s;ides.
Notwith&s;tanding all the expedition we could
make, it was dark before we pa&s;&s;ed the Cerchio,
which is an incon&s;iderable &s;tream in the neigh|bourhood
of Pi&s;a, where we arrived about
eight in the evening.</P>
<P>The country from Sarzana to the frontiers
of Tu&s;cany is a narrow plain, bounded on the
right by the &s;ea, and on the left by the Ap|penine
mountains. It is well cultivated and
inclo&s;ed, con&s;i&s;ting of meadow-ground, corn
fields, plantations of olives; and the trees
that form the hedge-rows &s;erve as &s;o many
props to the vines, which are twi&s;ted round
them, and continued from one to another.
After entering the dominions of Tu&s;cany, we
travelled through a noble fore&s;t of oak trees
of a con&s;iderable extent, which would have
appeared much more agreeable, had we not
<PB N="39" REF="41">
been benighted and apprehen&s;ive of rob|bers.
The la&s;t po&s;t but one in this day's
journey, is at the little town of Spirito
Santo, a kind of &s;ea-port on the Mediter|nean.
The roads are indifferent, and the
accommodation is execrable. I was glad to
find my&s;elf hou&s;ed in a very good inn at
Pi&s;a, where I promi&s;ed my&s;elf a good night's
re&s;t, and was not di&s;appointed. I heartily
wi&s;h you the &s;ame plea&s;ure, and am very
&s;incerely</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Nice, <DATE>January 28, 1765.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PISA is a fine old city that &s;trikes you
with the &s;ame veneration you would feel
at &s;ight of an antient temple which bears the
marks of decay, without being ab&s;olutely de|lapidated.
The hou&s;es are well built, the
&s;treets open, &s;traight, and well paved; the
<PB N="40" REF="42">
&s;hops well furni&s;hed; and the markets well
&s;upplied: there are &s;ome elegant palaces,
particularly that of the grand-duke, with a
marble &s;tatue of Ferdinand III. before it.
The churches are built with ta&s;te, and to|lerably
ornamented. There is a beautiful
wharf of free-&s;tone on each &s;ide of the river
Arno, which runs through the city, and three
bridges thrown over it, of which that in the
middle is of marble, a pretty piece of archi|tecture:
but the number of inhabitants is
very incon&s;iderable; and this very circum|&s;tance
gives it an air of maje&s;tic &s;olitude,
which is far from being unplea&s;ant to a man
of a contemplative turn of mind. For my
part, I cannot bear the tumult of a populous
commercial city; and the &s;olitude that reigns
in Pi&s;a would be a &s;trong motive to choo&s;e
it as a place of re&s;idence. Not that this
would be the only inducement for living at
Pi&s;a. Here is &s;ome good company, and even
a few men of ta&s;te and learning. The peo|ple
in general are counted &s;ociable and po|lite;
and there is great plenty of provi&s;ions,
at a very rea&s;onable rate. At &s;ome di&s;tance
from the more frequented parts of the city,
<PB N="41" REF="43">
a man may hire a large hou&s;e for thirty
crowns a year: but near the center, you
cannot have good lodgings, ready furni&s;hed,
for le&s;s than a <HI>&s;cudo</HI> (about five &s;hillings) a
day. The air in &s;ummer is reckoned un|whole&s;ome
by the exhalations ari&s;ing from
&s;tagnant water in the neighbourhood of the
city, which &s;tands in the mid&s;t of a fertile
plain, low and mar&s;hy: yet the&s;e mar&s;hes
have been con&s;iderably drained by the new
canal extending from hence to Leghorn.
As for the Arno, it is no longer navigable
for ve&s;&s;els of any burthen. The univer&s;ity
of Pi&s;a is very much decayed; and except
the little bu&s;ine&s;s occa&s;ioned by the emperor's
gallies, which are built in this town, I know
of no commerce it carries on: perhaps the
inhabitants live on the produce of the coun|try,
which con&s;i&s;ts of corn, wine, and cattle.
They are &s;upplied with excellent water for
drinking, by an aqueduct con&s;i&s;ting of above
five thou&s;and arches, begun by Co&s;mo, and
fini&s;hed by Ferdinand I. grand-dukes of
Tu&s;cany; it conveys the water from the
mountains at the di&s;tance of five miles.
This noble city, formerly the capital of a
<PB N="42" REF="44">
flouri&s;hing and powerful republic, which
contained above one hundred and fifty thou|&s;and
inhabitants, within its walls, is now &s;o
de&s;olate that gra&s;s grows in the open &s;treets;
and the number of its people do not exceed
&s;ixteen thou&s;and.</P>
<P>You need not doubt but I vi&s;ited the Cam|panile,
or hanging-tower, which is a beau|tiful
cylinder of eight &s;tories, each adorned
with a round of columns, ri&s;ing one above
another. It &s;tands by the cathedral, and in|clines
&s;o far on one &s;ide from the perpendi|cular,
that in dropping a plummet from the
top, which is one hundred and eighty-eight
feet high, it falls &s;ixteen feet from the ba&s;e.
For my part, I &s;hould never have dreamed
that this inclination proceeded from any other
cau&s;e, than an accidental &s;ub&s;idence of the
foundation on this &s;ide, if &s;ome connoi&s;&s;eurs
had not taken great pains to prove it was
done on purpo&s;e by the architect. Any per|&s;on
who has eyes may &s;ee that the pillars
on that &s;ide are con&s;iderably &s;unk; and this
is the ca&s;e with the very thre&s;hold of the
door by which you enter. I think it would
have been a very prepo&s;terous ambition in
<PB N="43" REF="45">
the architects, to &s;hew how far they could
deviate from the perpendicular in this con|&s;truction;
becau&s;e in that particular any
common ma&s;on could have rivalled them;
and if they really intended it as a &s;pecimen
of their art, they &s;hould have &s;hortened the
pila&s;ters on that &s;ide, &s;o as to exhibit them
intire, without the appearance of &s;inking.
The&s;e leaning towers are not unfrequent in
Italy; there is one at Bologna, another at
Venice, a third betwixt Venice and Ferrara,
and a fourth at Ravenna; and the inclination
in all of them has been &s;uppo&s;ed owing to
the foundations giving way on one &s;ide
only.</P>
<P>In the cathedral, which is a large Gothic
pile, there is a great number of ma&s;&s;y pil|lars
of porphyry, granite, ja&s;per, and verde
antico, together with &s;ome good pictures and
&s;tatues: but the greate&s;t curio&s;ity is that of
the bra&s;s-gates, de&s;igned and executed by
John of Bologna, repre&s;enting, embo&s;&s;ed in
different compartments, the hi&s;tory of the
Old and New Te&s;tament. I was &s;o charm|ed
with this work, that I could have &s;tood
a whole day to examine and admire it.
<PB N="44" REF="46">
In the Bapti&s;terium, which &s;tands oppo&s;ite
to this front, there are &s;ome beautiful mar|bles,
particularly the font, and a pulpit,
&s;upported by the &s;tatues of different an|imals.</P>
<P>Between the cathedral and this building,
about one hundred paces on one &s;ide, is the
famous burying-ground, called <HI>Campo Santo,</HI>
from its being covered with earth brought
from Jeru&s;alem. It is an oblong &s;quare, &s;ur|rounded
by a very high wall, and always kept
&s;hut. Within-&s;ide there is a &s;pacious corri|dore
round the whole &s;pace, which is a noble
walk for a contemplative philo&s;opher. It is
paved chiefly with flat grave-&s;tones: the walls
are painted in fre&s;co by Ghiotto, Giottino,
Stefano, Bennoti, Bufalmaco, and &s;ome o|thers
of his cotemporaries and di&s;ciples, who
flouri&s;hed immediately after the re&s;toration
of painting. The &s;ubjects are taken from
the Bible. Though the manner is dry, the
drawing incorrect, the de&s;ign generally lame,
and the colouring unnatural; yet there is
merit in the expre&s;&s;ion: and the whole re|mains
as a curious monument of the efforts
<PB N="45" REF="47">
made by this noble art immediately after her
revival. Here are &s;ome deceptions in per&s;pec|tive
equally ingenious and plea&s;ing; particu|larly
the figures of certain animals, which
exhibit exactly the &s;ame appearance, from
whatever different points of view they are
&s;een. One divi&s;ion of the burying-ground
con&s;i&s;ts, of a particular compo&s;t, which in
nine days con&s;umes the dead bodies to the
bones: in all probability, it is no other than
common earth mixed with quick-lime. At
one corner of the corridore, there are the
pictures of three bodies repre&s;ented in the
three different &s;tages of putrefaction which
they undergo when laid in this compo&s;ition.
At the end of the three fir&s;t days, the body
is bloated and &s;welled, and the features are
enlarged and di&s;torted to &s;uch a degree, as fills
the &s;pectator with horror. At the &s;ixth day,
the &s;welling is &s;ub&s;ided, and all the mu&s;cular
fle&s;h hangs loo&s;ened from the bones: at the
ninth, nothing but the &s;keleton remains.
There is a &s;mall neat chapel at one end of
the <HI>Campo Santo,</HI> with &s;ome tombs, on one of
which is a beautiful bu&s;t by Buona Roti. At
the other end of the corridore, there is a
<PB N="46" REF="48">
range of antient Roman &s;tone-coffins, re|pre&s;enting
on the &s;ides and covers &s;ome ex|cellent
pieces in ba&s;&s;o-relievo. The hunting
of Meleager has been greatly admired: but
what &s;truck me mo&s;t, was the figure of a
woman lying dead on a tomb-&s;tone, covered
with a piece of thin drapery, &s;o delicately
cut as to &s;hew all the flexures of the attitude,
and even all the &s;wellings and &s;inuo&s;ities of
the mu&s;cles. In&s;tead of &s;tone, it looks like
a &s;heet of wet linen.</P>
<P>For four zechines I hired a return-coach
and four from Pi&s;a to Florence. This road,
which lies along the Arno, is very good; and
the country is delightful, variegated with hill
and vale, wood and water, meadows and
corn-fields, planted and inclo&s;ed like the
counties of Middle&s;ex and Hamp&s;hire; with
this difference, however, that all the trees in
this tract were covered with vines, and the
ripe clu&s;ters black and white, hung down
from every bough in the mo&s;t luxuriant and
romantic abundance. The vines in this coun|try
are not planted in rows, and propped
with &s;ticks, as in France and the county
of Nice, but twine around the hedge-row
<PB N="47" REF="49">
trees, which they almo&s;t quite cover with
their foliage and fruit. The branches of
the vine are extended from tree to tree, ex|hibiting
beautiful fe&s;toons of real leaves,
tendrils, and &s;welling clu&s;ters a foot long.
By this oeconomy the ground of the inclo|&s;ure
is &s;pared for corn, gra&s;s, or any other
production. The trees commonly planted
for the purpo&s;e of &s;u&s;taining the vines, are
maple, elm, and aller, with which la&s;t the
banks of the Arno abound. This river,
which is very incon&s;iderable with re&s;pect to
the quantity of water, would be a charming
pa&s;toral &s;tream, if it was tran&s;parent; but it
is always muddy and di&s;coloured. About
ten or a dozen miles below Florence, there
are &s;ome marble quarries on the &s;ide of it,
from whence the blocks are conveyed in
boats, when there is water enough in the
river to float them, that is after heavy rains,
or the melting of the &s;now upon the moun|tains
of Umbria, being part of the Appenines,
from whence it takes its ri&s;e.</P>
<P>Florence is a noble city, that &s;till retains
all the marks of a maje&s;tic capital, &s;uch as
piazzas, palaces, fountains, bridges, &s;tatues,
<PB N="48" REF="50">
and arcades. I need not tell you that the
churches here are magnificent, and adorned
not only with pillars of oriental granite, por|phyry,
ja&s;per, verde antico, and other preci|ous
&s;tones; but al&s;o with capital pieces of
painting by the mo&s;t eminent ma&s;ters. Seve|ral
of the&s;e churches, however, &s;tand with|out
fronts, for want of money to complete
the plans. It may al&s;o appear &s;uperfluous to
mention my having viewed the famous gal|lery
of antiquities, the chapel of St. Lorenzo,
the palace of Pitti, the cathedral, the bap|ti&s;terium,
the <HI>Ponte de Trinita,</HI> with its &s;ta|tues,
the triumphal arch, and every thing
which is commonly vi&s;ited in this metropolis.
But all the&s;e objects having been circum&s;tan|tially
de&s;cribed by twenty different authors of
travels, I &s;hall not trouble you with a repeti|tion
of trite ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>That part of the city which &s;tands on each
&s;ide of the river, makes a very elegant ap|pearance,
to which the four bridges and the
&s;tone-quay between them, contribute in a
great mea&s;ure. I lodged at the widow
Vanini's, an Engli&s;h hou&s;e delightfully &s;i|tuated
in this quarter. The landlady, who is
<PB N="49" REF="51">
her&s;elf a native of England, we found very
obliging. The lodging-rooms are comforta|ble;
and the entertainment is good and rea|&s;onable.
There is a con&s;iderable number of
fa&s;hionable people at Florence, and many of
them in good circum&s;tances. They affect a
gaiety in their dre&s;s, equipage, and conver&s;a|tion;
but &s;tand very much on their punctilio
with &s;trangers; and will not, without great
reluctance, admit into their a&s;&s;emblies any
lady of another country, who&s;e noble&s;&s;e is
not a&s;certained by a title. This re&s;erve is in
&s;ome mea&s;ure excu&s;able among a people who
are extremely ignorant of foreign cu&s;toms,
and who know that in their own country,
every per&s;on, even the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant,
who has any preten&s;ions to family, either
inherits, or a&s;&s;umes the title of <HI>principe,
conte,</HI> or <HI>marche&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>With all their pride, however, the nobles
of Florence are humble enough to enter into
partner&s;hip with &s;hop-keepers, and even to
&s;ell wine by retail. It is an undoubted fact,
that in every palace or great hou&s;e in this city,
there is a little window fronting the &s;treet,
provided with an iron-knocker, and over it
<PB N="50" REF="52">
hangs an empty fla&s;k, by way of &s;ign-po&s;t.
Thither you &s;end your &s;ervant to buy a bottle
of wine. He knocks at the little wicket,
which is opened immediately by a dome&s;tic,
who &s;upplies him with what he wants, and
receives the money like the waiter of any
other cabaret. It is pretty extraordinary,
that it &s;hould not be deemed a di&s;paragement
in a nobleman to &s;ell half a pound of figs,
or a palm of ribbon or tape, or to take
money for a fla&s;k of &s;our wine; and yet be
counted infamous to match his daughter in
the family of a per&s;on who has di&s;tingui&s;hed
him&s;elf in any one of the learned profe&s;|&s;ions.</P>
<P>Though Florence be tolerably populous,
there &s;eems to be very little trade of any
kind in it: but the inhabitants flatter
them&s;elves with the pro&s;pect of reaping
great advantage from the re&s;idence of one
of the arch-dukes, for who&s;e reception they
are now repairing the palace of Pitti. I
know not what the revenues of Tu&s;cany may
amount to, &s;ince the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the princes
of Lorraine; but, under the la&s;t dukes of
the Medici family, they were &s;aid to pro|duce
<PB N="51" REF="53">
two millions of crowns, equal to five hun|dred
thou&s;and pounds &s;terling. The&s;e aro&s;e
from a very heavy tax upon land and hou&s;es,
the portions of maidens, and &s;uits at law, be|&s;ides
the duties upon traffick, a &s;evere gabelle
upon the nece&s;&s;aries of life, and a toll upon
every eatable entered into this capital. If
we may believe Leti, the grand duke was
then able to rai&s;e and maintain an army of
forty thou&s;and infantry, and three thou&s;and
hor&s;e; with twelve gallies, two galea&s;&s;es, and
twenty &s;hips of war. I que&s;tion if Tu&s;cany
can maintain at pre&s;ent above one half of
&s;uch an armament. He that now commands
the emperor's navy, con&s;i&s;ting of a few fri|gates,
is an Engli&s;hman, called Acton, who
was heretofore captain of a &s;hip in our Ea&s;t
India company's &s;ervice. He has lately em|braced
the catholic religion, and been created
admiral of Tu&s;cany.</P>
<P>There is a tolerable opera in Florence for
the entertainment of the be&s;t company,
though they do not &s;eem very attentive to
the mu&s;ick. Italy is certainly the native
country of this art; and yet, I do not find
the people in general either more mu&s;ically
<PB N="52" REF="54">
inclined, or better provided with ears than
their neighbours. Here is al&s;o a wretched
troop of comedians for the burgeois, and
lower cla&s;s of people: but what &s;eems mo&s;t
to &s;uit the ta&s;te of all ranks, is the exhibi|tion
of church pageantry. I had occa&s;ion to
&s;ee a proce&s;&s;ion, where all the noble&s;&s;e of the
city attended in their coaches, which filled
the whole length of the great &s;treet called the
<HI>Cor&s;o.</HI> It was the anniver&s;ary of a charitable
in&s;titution in favour of poor maidens, a cer|tain
number of whom are portioned every
year. About two hundred of the&s;e virgins
walked in proce&s;&s;ion, two and two together,
cloathed in violet-coloured wide gowns, with
white veils on their heads, and made a very
cla&s;&s;ical appearance. They were preceded
and followed by an irregular mob of penitents
in &s;ack-cloth, with lighted tapers, and monks
carrying crucifixes, bawling and bellowing
the litanies: but the great object was a fi|gure
of the Virgin Mary, as big as the life,
&s;tanding within a gilt frame, dre&s;&s;ed in a
gold &s;tuff, with a large hoop, a great quan|tity
of fal&s;e jewels, her face painted and
patched, and her hair frizzled and curled in
<PB N="53" REF="55">
the very extremity of the fa&s;hion. Very lit|tle
regard had been paid to the image of our
Saviour on the cro&s;s; but when his lady-mother
appeared on the &s;houlders of three or
four lu&s;ty friars, the whole populace fell up|on
their knees in the dirt. This extraordi|nary
veneration paid to the Virgin, mu&s;t
have been derived originally from the French,
who pique them&s;elves on their gallantry to
the fair &s;ex.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t all the &s;cenery of the Roman ca|tholic
religion, I have never yet &s;een any of
the &s;pectators affected at heart, or di&s;cover
the lea&s;t &s;igns of fanatici&s;m. The very di&s;ci|plinants,
who &s;courge them&s;elves in the Holy-week,
are generally pea&s;ants or parties hired
for the purpo&s;e. Tho&s;e of the confrairies,
who have an ambition to di&s;tingui&s;h them|&s;elves
on &s;uch occa&s;ions, take care to &s;ecure
their backs from the &s;mart, by means of
&s;ecret armour, either women's boddice, or
quilted jackets. The confrairies are fraterni|ties
of devotees, who inli&s;t them&s;elves under
the banners of particular &s;aints. On days
of proce&s;&s;ion they appear in a body dre&s;&s;ed
as penitents and ma&s;ked, and di&s;tingui&s;hed
<PB N="54" REF="56">
by cro&s;&s;es on their habits. There is &s;carce
an individual, whether noble or plebeian,
who does not belong to one of the&s;e a&s;&s;ocia|tions,
which may be compared to the Free-Ma&s;ons,
Gregoreans, and Antigallicans of
England.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t without one of the gates of Florence,
there is a triumphal arch erected on occa&s;ion
of the late emperor's making his public
entry, when he &s;ucceeded to the dukedom
of Tu&s;cany: and here in the &s;ummer even|ings,
the quality re&s;ort to take the air in their
coaches. Every carriage &s;tops, and forms a lit|tle
&s;eparate conver&s;azione. The ladies &s;it within,
and the cici&s;bei &s;tand on the foot-boards, on
each &s;ide of the coach, entertaining them
with their di&s;cour&s;e. It would be no un|plea&s;ant
inquiry to trace this &s;ort of gallantry
to its original, and inve&s;tigate all its progre&s;s.
The Italians, having been accu&s;ed of jea|lou&s;y,
were re&s;olved to wipe off the reproach,
and, &s;eeking to avoid it for the future, have
run into the other extreme. I know it is
generally &s;uppo&s;ed that the cu&s;tom of choo&s;ing
cici&s;bei, was calculated to prevent the ex|tinction
of families, which would other|wi&s;e

often happen in con&s;equence of mar|riages
founded upon intere&s;t, without any
mutual affection in the contracting parties.
How far this political con&s;ideration may have
weighed again&s;t the jealous and vindictive
temper of the Italians, I will not pretend to
judge: but, certain it is, every married lady
in this country has her cici&s;beo, or &s;erviente,
who attends her every where, and on all oc|ca&s;ions;
and upon who&s;e privileges the hu&s;|band
dares not encroach, without incurring
the cen&s;ure and ridicule of the whole com|munity.
For my part, I would rather be
condemned for life to the gallies, than exer|ci&s;e
the office of a cici&s;beo, expo&s;ed to the
intolerable caprices and dangerous re&s;entment
of an Italian virago. I pretend not to judge
of the national character, from my own ob|&s;ervation:
but, if the portraits drawn by
Goldoni in his Comedies are taken from na|ture,
I would not he&s;itate to pronounce the
Italian women the mo&s;t haughty, in&s;olent,
capricious, and revengeful females on the
face of the earth. Indeed their re&s;entments
are &s;o cruelly implacable, and contain &s;uch a
mixture of perfidy, that, in my opinion,
<PB N="56" REF="58">
they are very unfit &s;ubjects for comedy, who&s;e
province it is, rather to ridicule folly than to
&s;tigmatize &s;uch atrocious vice.</P>
<P>You have often heard it &s;aid, that the
purity of the Italian is to be found in the
<HI>lingua To&s;cana,</HI> and <HI>bocca Romana.</HI> Certain
it is, the pronunciation of the Tu&s;cans is
di&s;agreeably guttural: the letters C and G
they pronounce with an a&s;piration, which
hurts the ear of an Engli&s;hman; and is I
think rather rougher than that of the X, in
Spani&s;h. It &s;ounds as if the &s;peaker had lo&s;t
his palate. I really imagined the fir&s;t man I
heard &s;peak in Pi&s;a, had met with that mi&s;|fortune
in the cour&s;e of his amours.</P>
<P>One of the greate&s;t curio&s;ities you meet with
in Italy, is the Improvi&s;atore; &s;uch is the
name given to certain individuals, who have
the &s;urpri&s;ing talent of reciting ver&s;es extem|pore,
on any &s;ubject you propo&s;e. Mr. Cor|ve&s;i,
my landlord, has a &s;on, a Franci&s;can
friar, who is a great genius in this way.
When the &s;ubject is given, his brother tunes
his violin to accompany him, and he begins
to rehear&s;e in recitative, with wonderful
fluency and preci&s;ion. Thus he will, at a
<PB N="57" REF="59">
minute's warning, recite two or three hundred
ver&s;es, well turned, and well adapted, and
generally mingled with an elegant compli|ment
to the company. The Italians are &s;o
fond of poetry, that many of them have the
be&s;t part of Ario&s;to, Ta&s;&s;o, and Petrarch, by
heart; and the&s;e are the great &s;ources from
which the Improvi&s;atori draw their rhimes,
cadence, and turns of expre&s;&s;ion. But, le&s;t
you &s;hould think there is neither rhime nor
rea&s;on in protracting this tedious epi&s;tle, I
&s;hall conclude it with the old burden of my
&s;ong, that I am always</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Nice, <DATE>February 5, 1765.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR entertaining letter of the fifth of
la&s;t month, was a very charitable and
a very agreeable donation: but your &s;u&s;picion
is groundle&s;s. I a&s;&s;ure you, upon my honour,
<PB N="58" REF="60">
I have no &s;hare whatever in any of the di&s;|putes
which agitate the public: nor do I know
any thing of your political tran&s;actions, ex|cept
what I ca&s;ually &s;ee in one of your news|papers,
with the peru&s;al of which I am &s;ome|times
favoured by our con&s;ul at Villefranche.
You in&s;i&s;t upon my being more particular in
my remarks on what I &s;aw at Florence, and
I &s;hall obey the injunction. The famous gal|lery
which contains the antiquities, is the third
&s;tory of a noble &s;tone-edifice, built in the form
of the Greek II, the upper part fronting the
river Arno, and one of the legs adjoining to
the ducal-palace, where the courts of ju&s;tice
are held. As the hou&s;e of Medici had for
&s;ome centuries re&s;ided in the palace of Pitti,
&s;ituated on the other &s;ide of the river, a full
mile from the&s;e tribunals, the architect Va&s;ari,
who planned the new edifice, at the &s;ame time
contrived a corridore, or covered pa&s;&s;age, ex|tending
from the palace of Pitti along one
of the bridges, to the gallery of curio&s;ities,
through which the grand-duke pa&s;&s;ed un&s;een,
when he was di&s;po&s;ed either to amu&s;e him|&s;elf
with his antiquities, or to a&s;&s;i&s;t at his
courts of judicature: but there is nothing
<PB N="59" REF="61">
very extraordinary either in the contrivance
or execution of this corridore.</P>
<P>If I re&s;ided in Florence I would give &s;ome|thing
extraordinary for permi&s;&s;ion to walk
every day in the gallery, which I &s;hould much
prefer to the Lycaeum, the groves of Acade|mus,
or any porch or philo&s;ophical alley in
Athens or in Rome. Here by viewing the
&s;tatues and bu&s;ts ranged on each &s;ide, I &s;hould
become acquainted with the faces of all the
remarkable per&s;onages, male and female, of
antiquity, and even be able to trace their dif|ferent
characters from the expre&s;&s;ion of their
features. This collection is a mo&s;t excellent
commentary upon the Roman hi&s;torians, par|ticularly
Suetonius and Dion Ca&s;&s;ius. There
was one circum&s;tance that &s;truck me in view|ing
the bu&s;ts of Caracalla, both here and in
the Capitol at Rome; that was a certain fero|city
in the eyes, which &s;eemed to contradict
the &s;weetne&s;s of the other features, and re|markably
ju&s;tified the epithet <HI>Caracuyl,</HI> by
which he was di&s;tingui&s;hed by the antient in|habitants
of North-Britain. In the language
of the Highlanders <HI>caracuyl</HI> &s;ignifies <HI>cruel eye,</HI>
as we are given to under&s;tand by the ingenious
<PB N="60" REF="62">
editor of Fingal, who &s;eems to think that
Caracalla is no other than the Celtic word,
adapted to the pronunciation of the Romans:
but the truth is, Caracalla was the name of
a Gauli&s;h ve&s;tment, which this prince affected
to wear; and hence he derived that &s;urname.
The Caracuyl of the Britons, is the &s;ame as
the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> of the Greeks, which Homer
has &s;o often applied to his Scolding Heroes.
I like the Bacchanalian, chiefly for the fine dra|pery.
The wind, occa&s;ioned by her motion,
&s;eems to have &s;welled and rai&s;ed it from the
parts of the body which it covers. There is
another gay Bacchanalian, in the attitude of
dancing, crowned with ivy, holding in her
right hand a bunch of grapes, and in her
right the thyr&s;us. The head of the cele|brated
Flora is very beautiful: the groupe
of Cupid and Py&s;che, however, did not
give me all the plea&s;ure I expected from
it.</P>
<P>Of all the marbles that appear in the open
gallery, the following are tho&s;e I mo&s;t admire.
Leda with the Swan; as for Jupiter, in this
transformation, he has much the appearance
of a goo&s;e. I have not &s;een any thing tamer:
<PB N="61" REF="63">
but the &s;culptor has admirably &s;hewn his art
in repre&s;enting Leda's hand partly hid among
the feathers, which are &s;o lightly touched off,
that the very &s;hape of the fingers are &s;een
underneath. The &s;tatue of a youth, &s;uppo&s;ed
to be Ganymede, is compared by the con|noi&s;&s;eurs
to the celebrated Venus, and as far
as I can judge, not without rea&s;on: it is,
however, rather agreeable than &s;triking, and
will plea&s;e a connoi&s;&s;eur much more than a
common &s;pectator. I know not whether it is
my regard to the faculty that inhances the
value of the noted Ae&s;culapius, who appears
with a venerable beard of delicate workman|&s;hip.
He is larger than the life, cloathed in
a magnificent pallium, his left arm re&s;ting on
a knotted &s;taff, round which the &s;nake is
twined according to Ovid:
<Q><L>Hunc modo &s;erpentem baculum qui nexibus ambit</L>
<L>Per&s;pice&mdash;</L></Q>
He has in his hand the <HI>fa&s;cia herbarum,</HI> and
the <HI>crepidoe</HI> on his feet. There is a wild-boar re|pre&s;ented
lying on one &s;ide, which I admire
as a ma&s;ter-piece. The &s;avagene&s;s of his ap|pearance
is finely contra&s;ted with the ea&s;e
<PB N="62" REF="64">
and indolence of the attitude. Were I to
meet with a living boar lying with the &s;ame
expre&s;&s;ion, I &s;hould be tempted to &s;troke his
bri&s;tles. Here is an elegant bu&s;t of Anti|nous,
the favourite of Adrian; and a beauti|ful
head of Alexander the Great, turned on
one &s;ide, with an expre&s;&s;ion of langui&s;hment
and anxiety in his countenance. The virtuo&s;i
are not agreed about the circum&s;tance in
which he is repre&s;ented; whether fainting
with the lo&s;s of blood which he &s;uffered in
his adventure at Oxydrace; or langui&s;hing
with the fever contracted by bathing in the
Cydnus; or finally complaining to his father
Jove, that there were no other worlds for him
to conquer. The kneeling Narci&s;&s;us is a
&s;triking figure, and the expre&s;&s;ion admirable.
The two Bacchi are perfectly well executed;
but (to my &s;hame be it &s;poken) I prefer to
the antique that which is the work of Michael
Angelo Buonaroti, concerning which the
&s;tory is told which you well know. The
arti&s;t having been blamed by &s;ome pre|tended
connoi&s;&s;eurs, for not imitating the
manner of the ancients, is &s;aid to have pri|vately
fini&s;hed this Bacchus, and buried it,
<PB N="63" REF="65">
after having broke off an arm, which he kept
as a voucher. The &s;tatue, being dug up by
accident, was allowed by the be&s;t judges, to
be a perfect antique; upon which Buonaroti
produced the arm, and claimed his own work.
Signior Bianchi, the keeper of this mu&s;aeum,
looks upon this as a fable; but owns that
Va&s;ari tells &s;uch another of a child cut in
marble by the &s;ame arti&s;t, which being car|ried
to Rome, and kept for &s;ome time under
ground, was dug up as an antique, and &s;old
for a great deal of money. I was likewi&s;e at|tracted
by the Morpheus in touch&s;tone, which
is de&s;cribed by Addi&s;on, who, by the bye,
notwith&s;tanding all his ta&s;te, has been con|victed
by Bianchi of &s;everal gro&s;s blunders in
his account of this gallery.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the famous Venus Pontia,
commonly called <HI>de Medicis,</HI> which was found
at Tivoli, and is kept in a &s;eparate apart|ment
called the <HI>Tribuna,</HI> I believe I ought to
be intirely &s;ilent, or at lea&s;t conceal my real
&s;entiments, which will otherwi&s;e appear
equally ab&s;urd and pre&s;umptuous. It mu&s;t
be want of ta&s;te that prevents my feeling that
enthu&s;ia&s;tic admiration with which others are
<PB N="64" REF="66">
in&s;pired at fight of this &s;tatue: a &s;tatue
which in reputation equals that of Cupid by
Praxiteles, which brought &s;uch a concour&s;e of
&s;trangers of old to the little town of The&s;piae.
I cannot help thinking that there is no beauty
in the features of Venus; and that the atti|tude
is aukward and out of character. It is a
bad plea to urge that the antients and we
differ in the ideas of beauty. We know the
contrary, from their medals, bu&s;ts, and hi&s;to|rians.
Without all doubt, the limbs and
proportions of this &s;tatue are elegantly formed,
and accurately de&s;igned, according to the
nice&s;t rules of &s;ymmetry and proportion; and
the back parts e&s;pecially are executed &s;o hap|pily,
as to excite the admiration of the mo&s;t
indifferent &s;pectator. One cannot help think|ing
it is the very Venus of <HI>Cnidos</HI> by Prax|iteles,
which Lucian de&s;cribes. &startq;Hercle
quanta dor&s;i concinnitas! ut exuberantes
lumbi amplexantes manus implent! quam
&s;cite circumductae clunium pulpae in &s;e ro|tundantur,
neque tenues nimis ip&s;is o&s;&s;ibus
ad&s;trictae, neque in immen&s;am effu&s;ae Pingue|dinem!&endq;
That the &s;tatue thus de&s;cribed
was not the <HI>Venus de Medicis,</HI> would appear
<PB N="65" REF="67">
from the Greek in&s;cription on the ba&s;e,
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. <HI>Cleomenes
filius Apollodori fecit;</HI> did we not know that
this in&s;cription is counted &s;purious, and
that in&s;tead of <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, it &s;hould be
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. This, however, is but a fri|volous
objection, as we have &s;een many
in&s;criptions undoubtedly antique, in which
the orthography is fal&s;e, either from the ig|norance
or carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of the &s;culptor. Others
&s;uppo&s;e, not without rea&s;on, that this &s;tatue
is a repre&s;entation of the famous Phryne,
the courte&s;an of Athens, who at the cele|bration
of the Eleu&s;inian games, exhibited
her&s;elf coming out of the bath, naked, to
the eyes of the whole Athenian people. I
was much plea&s;ed with the dancing faun;
and &s;till better with the Lotti, or wre&s;tlers, the
attitudes of which are beautifully contrived
to &s;hew the different turns of the limbs, and
the &s;welling of the mu&s;cles: but, what plea&s;ed
me be&s;t of all the &s;tatues in the Tribuna was
the Arrotino, commonly called the Whetter,
and generally &s;uppo&s;ed to repre&s;ent a &s;lave,
who in the act of whetting a knife, overhears
<PB N="66" REF="68">
the con&s;piracy of Cataline. You know he is
repre&s;ented on one knee; and certain it is, I
never &s;aw &s;uch an expre&s;&s;ion of anxious at|tention,
as appears in his countenance. But
it is not mingled with any marks of &s;urpri&s;e,
&s;uch as could not fail to lay hold on a man
who overhears by accident a con&s;piracy again&s;t
the &s;tate. The marquis de Maffei has ju&s;tly
ob&s;erved that Sallu&s;t, in his very circum|&s;tantial
detail of that con&s;piracy, makes no
mention of any &s;uch di&s;covery. Neither does
it appear, that the figure is in the act of
whetting, the &s;tone which he holds in one
hand being rough and unequal, no ways re|&s;embling
a whet&s;tone. Others alledge it re|pre&s;ents
Milico, the freedman of Scaevinus,
who con&s;pired again&s;t the life of Nero, and
gave his poignard to be whetted to Milico,
who pre&s;ented it to the emperor, with an
account of the con&s;piracy: but the attitude
and expre&s;&s;ion will by no means admit of this
interpretation. Signore Bianchi, who is him|&s;elf
a learned and judicious antiquarian,
thinks the &s;tatue repre&s;ents the augur Attius
Navius, who cut a &s;tone with a knife, at the
command of Tarquinius Pri&s;cus. This con|jecture
<PB N="67" REF="69">
&s;eems to be confirmed by a medallion
of Antoninus Pius, in&s;erted by Vaillant among
his Numi&s;mata Pre&s;tantiora, on which is de|lineated
nearly &s;uch a figure as this in que&s;|tion,
with the following legend, &startq;Attius
Navius genuflexus ante Tarquinium Pri&s;cum
cotem cultro di&s;cidit.&endq; He owns indeed that
in the &s;tatue, the augur is not di&s;tingui&s;hed
either by his habit or emblems; and he
might have added, neither is the &s;tone a cotes.
For my own part, I think neither of the&s;e
three opinions is &s;atisfactory, though the la&s;t
is very ingenious. Perhaps the figure alludes
to a private incident, which never was re|corded
in any hi&s;tory. Among the great
number of pictures in this Tribuna, I was
mo&s;t charmed with the Venus by Titian,
which has a &s;weetne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion and ten|derne&s;s
of colouring, not to be de&s;cribed. In
this apartment, they reckon three hundred
pieces, the greate&s;t part by the be&s;t ma&s;ters,
particularly by Raphael, in the three manners
by which he di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf at different
periods of his life. As for the celebrated
&s;tatue of the hermaphodrite, which we find
in another room, I give the &s;culptor credit for
<PB N="68" REF="70">
his ingenuity in mingling the &s;exes in the
compo&s;ition; but it is, at be&s;t, no other than
a mon&s;ter in nature, which I never had any
plea&s;ure in viewing: nor, indeed, do I think
there was much talent required in repre|&s;enting
a figure with the head and brea&s;ts
of a woman, and all the other parts of the
body ma&s;culine. There is &s;uch a profu&s;ion
of curio&s;ities in this celebrated mu&s;aeum;
&s;tatues, bu&s;ts, pictures, medals, tables inlaid
in the way of marquetry, cabinets adorned
with precious &s;tones, jewels of all &s;orts, ma|thematical
in&s;truments, antient arms and
military machines, that the imagination is
bewildered; and a &s;tranger of a vi&s;ionary turn,
would be apt to fancy him&s;elf in a palace of
the fairies, rai&s;ed and adorned by the power
of inchantment.</P>
<P>In one of the detached apartments, I &s;aw
the antependium of the altar, de&s;igned for the
famous chapel of St. Lorenzo. It is a curious
piece of architecture, inlaid with coloured mar|ble
and precious &s;tones, &s;o as to repre&s;ent
an infinite variety of natural objects. It is
adorned with &s;ome cry&s;tal pillars, with ca|pitals
of beaten gold. The &s;econd &s;tory of
<PB N="69" REF="71">
the building is occupied by a great number
of arti&s;ts employed in this very curious work
of marquetry, repre&s;enting figures with gems
and different kinds of coloured marble, for
the u&s;e of the emperor. The Italians call it
<HI>pietre comme&s;&s;e,</HI> a &s;ort of inlaying with &s;tones,
analogous to the fineering of cabinets in
wood. It is peculiar to Florence, and &s;eems
to be &s;till more curious than the Mo&s;aic
work, which the Romans have brought to
great perfection.</P>
<P>The cathedral of Florence is a great Gothic
building, encru&s;ted on the out&s;ide with mar|ble;
it is remarkable for nothing but its
cupola, which is &s;aid to have been copied by
the architect of St. Peter's at Rome, and for
it's &s;ize, which is much greater than that of
any other church in Chri&s;tendom. The bap|ti&s;tery,
which &s;tands by it, was an antient
temple, &s;aid to be dedicated to Mars. There
are &s;ome good &s;tatues of marble within; and
one or two of bronze on the out&s;ide of the
doors; but it is chiefly celebrated for the
embo&s;&s;ed work of its bra&s;s gates, by Lorenzo
Ghiberti, which Buonaroti u&s;ed to &s;ay, de|&s;erved
to be made the gates of Paradi&s;e. I
<PB N="70" REF="72">
viewed them with plea&s;ure: but &s;till I re|tained
a greater veneration for tho&s;e of Pi&s;a,
which I had fir&s;t admired: a preference
which either ari&s;es from want of ta&s;te, or
from the charm of novelty, by which the
former were recommended to my attention.
Tho&s;e who would have a particular de|tail
of every thing worth &s;eeing at Florence,
comprehending churches, libraries, palaces,
tombs, &s;tatues, pictures, fountains, bridges,
&amp;c. may con&s;ult Key&s;ler, who is &s;o laboriou&s;ly
circum&s;tantial in his de&s;criptions, that I never
could peru&s;e them, without &s;uffering the head|ach,
and recollecting the old ob&s;ervation, That
the German genius lies more in the back
than in the brain.</P>
<P>I was much di&s;appointed in the chapel of
St. Lorenzo. Notwith&s;tanding the great pro|fu&s;ion
of granite, porphyry, ja&s;per, verde an|tico,
lapis-lazuli, and other precious &s;tones,
repre&s;enting figures in the way of marquetry,
I think the whole has a gloomy effect. The&s;e
<HI>pietre comme&s;&s;e</HI> are better calculated for cabi|nets,
than for ornaments to great buildings,
which ought to be large ma&s;&s;es proportioned
to the greatne&s;s of the edifice. The com|partments
<PB N="71" REF="73">
are &s;o &s;mall, that they produce no
effect in giving the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion when one
enters the place; except to give an air of
littlene&s;s to the whole, ju&s;t as if a grand
&s;aloon was covered with pictures painted in
miniature. If they have as little regard to
proportion and per&s;pective, when they paint
the dome, which is not yet fini&s;hed, this cha|pel,
will in my opinion, remain a monument
of ill ta&s;te and extravagance.</P>
<P>The court of the palace of Pitti is formed
by three &s;ides of an elegant &s;quare, with ar|cades
all round, like the palace of Holyrood
hou&s;e at Edinburgh; and the ru&s;tic work,
which con&s;titues the lower part of the build|ing,
gives it an air of &s;trength and magni|ficence.
In this court, there is a fine fountain,
in which the water trickles down from above;
and here is al&s;o an admirable antique &s;tatue
of Hercules, in&s;cribed <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">,
the work of Ly&s;ippus.</P>
<P>The apartments of this palace are generally
&s;mall, and many of them dark. Among the
paintings, the mo&s;t remarkable is the Ma|donna
de la Seggiola, by Raphael, counted
one of the be&s;t coloured pieces of that great
<PB N="72" REF="74">
ma&s;ter. If I was allowed to find fault with
the performance, I &s;hould pronounce it de|fective
in dignity and &s;entiment. It is the
expre&s;&s;ion of a pea&s;ant rather than of the
mother of God. She exhibits the fondne&s;s
and joy of a young woman towards her fir&s;t-born
&s;on, without that rapture of admiration
which we expect to find in the Virgin Mary,
while &s;he contemplates, in the fruit of her
own womb, the Saviour of mankind. In
other re&s;pects, it is a fine figure, gay, agree|able,
and very expre&s;&s;ive of maternal tender|ne&s;s;
and the <HI>bambino</HI> is extremely beautiful.
There was an Engli&s;h painter employed in
copying this picture, and what he had done
was executed with great &s;ucce&s;s. I am one
of tho&s;e who think it very po&s;&s;ible to imitate
the be&s;t pieces in &s;uch a manner, that even
the connoi&s;&s;eurs &s;hall not be able to di&s;|tingui&s;h
the original from the copy. After
all, I do not &s;et up for a judge in the&s;e mat|ters,
and very likely I may incur the ri|dicule
of the virtuo&s;i for the remarks I have
made: but I am u&s;ed to &s;peak my mind
freely on all &s;ubjects that fall under the
cognizance of my &s;en&s;es; though I mu&s;t
<PB N="73" REF="75">
as freely own, there is &s;omething more than
common &s;en&s;e required to di&s;cover and di&s;|tingui&s;h

<HEAD>LETTER XXIX.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Nice, <DATE>February 20, 1765.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING &s;een all the curio&s;ities of
Florence, and hired a good travelling
coach for &s;even weeks, at the price of &s;even
zequines, &s;omething le&s;s than three guineas
and a half, we &s;et out po&s;t for Rome, by
the way of Sienna, where we lay the fir&s;t
night. The country through which we pa&s;&s;ed
is mountainous but agreeable. Of Sienna
I can &s;ay nothing from my own ob&s;ervation,
but that we were indifferently lodged in a
hou&s;e that &s;tunk like a privy, and fared
<PB N="74" REF="76">
wretchedly at &s;upper. The city is large and
well built: the inhabitants pique them&s;elves
upon their politene&s;s, and the purity of their
dialect. Certain it is, &s;ome &s;trangers re&s;ide
in this place on purpo&s;e to learn the be&s;t pro|nunciation
of the Italian tongue. The Mo|&s;aic
pavement of their duomo, or cathedral,
has been much admired; as well as the
hi&s;tory of Aeneas Sylvius, afterwards pope
Pius II. painted on the walls of the library,
partly by Pietro Perugino, and partly by his
pupil Raphael D'Urbino.</P>
<P>Next day, at Buon Convento, where the
emperor Henry VII. was poi&s;oned by a friar
with the &s;acramental wafer, I refu&s;ed to give
money to the ho&s;tler, who in revenge put two
young unbroke &s;tone-hor&s;es in the traces next
to the coach, which became &s;o unruly, that
before we had gone a quarter of a mile, they
and the po&s;tilion were rolling in the du&s;t. In
this &s;ituation they made &s;uch efforts to di&s;en|gage
them&s;elves, and kicked with &s;uch violence,
that I imagined the carriage and all our trunks
would have been beaten in pieces. We leaped
out of the coach, however, without &s;u&s;tain|ing
any per&s;onal damage, except the fright;
<PB N="75" REF="77">
nor was any hurt done to the vehicle. But
the hor&s;es were terribly brui&s;ed, and almo&s;t
&s;trangled, before they could be di&s;engaged.
Exa&s;perated at the villany of the ho&s;tler, I
re&s;olved to make a complaint to the magi|&s;trate
of the place, who is called <HI>uffiziale.</HI>
I found him wrapped in an old, grea&s;y,
ragged, great-coat, &s;itting in a wretched
apartment, without either gla&s;s, paper, or
boards in the windows; and there was no
&s;ort of furniture but a couple of broken
chairs and a mi&s;erable truckle-bed. He
looked pale, meagre, and haggard, and had
more the air of a half-&s;tarved pri&s;oner than
of a magi&s;trate. Having heard my com|plaint,
he came forth into a kind of outward
room or bellfrey, and rung a great bell with
his own hand. In con&s;equence of this &s;ignal,
the po&s;t-ma&s;ter came up &s;tairs, and I &s;uppo&s;e
he was the fir&s;t man in the place, for the
<HI>uffiziale</HI> &s;tood before him cap-in-hand, and
with great marks of humble re&s;pect repeated
the complaint I had made. This man a&s;&s;ured
me, with an air of con&s;cious importance, that
he him&s;elf had ordered the ho&s;tler to &s;upply
me with tho&s;e very hor&s;es, which were the
<PB N="76" REF="78">
be&s;t in his &s;table; and that the misfortune
which happened was owing to the mi&s;conduct
of the fore-po&s;tilion, who did not keep the
fore hor&s;es to a proper &s;peed proportioned to
the mettle of the other two. As he took the
affair upon him&s;elf, and I perceived had an
a&s;cendancy over the magi&s;trate, I contented
my&s;elf with &s;aying, I was certain the two
hor&s;es had been put to the coach on purpo&s;e,
either to hurt or frighten us; and that &s;ince I
could not have ju&s;tice here I would make a
formal complaint to the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter at
Florence. In pa&s;&s;ing through the &s;treet to
the coach, which was by this time furni&s;hed
with fre&s;h hor&s;es, I met the ho&s;tler, and would
have caned him heartily; but perceiving my
intention, he took to his heels and vani&s;hed.
Of all the people I have ever &s;een, the ho&s;t|lers,
po&s;tilions, and other fellows hanging a|bout
the po&s;t-hou&s;es in Italy, are the mo&s;t
greedy, impertinent, and provoking. Happy
are tho&s;e travellers who have phlegm enough
to di&s;regard their in&s;olence and importunity:
for this is not &s;o di&s;agreeable as their revenge
is dangerous. An Engli&s;h gentleman at
Florence told me, that one of tho&s;e fellows,
<PB N="77" REF="79">
whom he had &s;truck for his impertinence,
flew at him with a long knife, and he could
hardly keep him at &s;word's point. All of
them wear &s;uch knives, and are very apt to
u&s;e them on the &s;lighte&s;t provocation. But
their open attacks are not &s;o formidable as
their premeditated &s;chemes of revenge; in the
pro&s;ecution of which the Italians are equally
treacherous and cruel.</P>
<P>This night we pa&s;&s;ed at a place called
Radicofani, a village and fort, &s;ituated on
the top of a very high mountain. The inn
&s;tands &s;till lower than the town. It was
built at the expence of the la&s;t grand-duke
of Tu&s;cany; is very large, very cold, and un|comfortable.
One would imagine it was con|trived
for coolne&s;s, though &s;ituated &s;o high,
that even in the mid&s;t of &s;ummer, a travel|ler
would be glad to have a fire in his cham|ber.
But few, or none of them have fire|places,
and there is not a bed with curtains
or te&s;ter in the hou&s;e. All the adjacent
country is naked and barren. On the third
day we entered the pope's territories, &s;ome
parts of which are delightful. Having pa&s;&s;ed
Aqua-Pendente, a beggarly town, &s;ituated on
<PB N="78" REF="80">
the top of a rock, from whence there is a
romantic ca&s;cade of water, which gives it
the name, we travelled along the &s;ide of the
lake Bol&s;ena, a beautiful piece of water about
thirty miles in circuit, with two i&s;lands in
the middle, the banks covered with noble
plantations of oak and cypre&s;s. The town
of Bol&s;ena &s;tanding near the ruins of the
antient Vol&s;inium, which was the birth-place
of Sejanus, is a paultry village; and Monte|&s;ia&s;cone,
famous for its wine, is a poor de|cayed
town in this neighbourhood, &s;ituated
on the &s;ide of a hill, which, according
to the author of the Grand Tour, was
the only directory I had along with me, is
&s;uppo&s;ed to be the Soracte of the ancients. If
we may believe Horace, Soracte was vi&s;ible
from Rome: for, in his ninth ode, addre&s;&s;ed
to Thaliarchus, he &s;ays,
<Q><L>Vides, ut alta &s;tet nive candidum</L>
<L>Soracte&mdash;</L></Q>
but, in order to &s;ee Montefia&s;cone, his eye|&s;ight
mu&s;t have penetrated through the Mons
Cyminus, at the foot of which &s;tands the
city of Viterbo. Pliny tells us, that Soracte
<PB N="79" REF="81">
was not far from Rome, <HI>haud procul ab urbe
Roma;</HI> but Montefia&s;cone is fifty miles from
this city. And De&s;prez, in his notes upon
Horace, &s;ays it is now called Monte S. Ore&s;te.
Addi&s;on tells us he pa&s;&s;ed by it in the Cam|pania.
I could not without indignation re|flect
upon the bigotry of Mathilda, who
gave this fine country to the &s;ee of Rome,
under the dominion of which no country
was ever known to pro&s;per.</P>
<P>About half way between Montefia&s;cone
and Viterbo, one of our fore-wheels flew off,
together with a large &s;plinter of the axle-tree;
and if one of the po&s;tilions had not
by great accident been a remarkably ingeni|ous
fellow, we &s;hould have been put to the
greate&s;t inconvenience, as there was no town,
or even hou&s;e, within &s;everal miles. I men|tion
this circum&s;tance, by way of warning to
other travellers, that they may provide them|&s;elves
with a hammer and nails, a &s;pare iron-pin
or two, a large knife, and bladder of
grea&s;e, to be u&s;ed occa&s;ionally in ca&s;e of &s;uch
misfortune.</P>
<P>The mountain of Viterbo is covered with
beautiful plantations and villas belonging to
<PB N="80" REF="82">
the Roman nobility, who come hither to make
the <HI>villegiatura</HI> in &s;ummer. Of the city of
Viterbo I &s;hall &s;ay nothing, but that it is the
capital of that country which Mathilda gave
to the Roman &s;ee. The place is well built,
adorned with public fountains, and a great
number of churches and convents; yet far
from being populous, the whole number of
inhabitants, not exceeding fifteen thou&s;and.
The po&s;t-hou&s;e is one of the wor&s;t inns I ever
entered.</P>
<P>After having pa&s;&s;ed this mountain, the
Cyminus of the antients, we &s;kirted part of
the lake, which is now called de Vico, and
who&s;e banks afford the mo&s;t agreeable rural
pro&s;pects of hill and vale, wood, glade and
water, &s;hade and &s;un-&s;hine. A few other
very incon&s;iderable places we pa&s;&s;ed, and de|&s;cended
into the Campania of Rome, which
is almo&s;t a de&s;ert. The view of this coun|try,
in its pre&s;ent &s;ituation, cannot but pro|duce
emotions of pity and indignation in the
mind of every per&s;on who retains any idea of
its antient cultivation and fertility. It is no|thing
but a naked withered down, de&s;olate
and dreary, almo&s;t without inclo&s;ure, corn|field,
<PB N="81" REF="83">
hedge, tree, &s;hrub, hou&s;e, hut, or habi|tation;
exhibiting here and there the ruins of
an antient ca&s;tellum, tomb, or temple, and
in &s;ome places the remains of a Roman via.
I heard much of the&s;e antient works, and
was greatly di&s;appointed when I &s;aw them.
The Via Ca&s;&s;ia or Cymina is paved with
broad, &s;olid, flint-&s;tones, which mu&s;t have
greatly incommoded the feet of hor&s;es that
travelled upon it, as well as endangered the
lives of the riders from the &s;lipperine&s;s of
the pavement: be&s;ides, it is &s;o narrow that
two modern carriages could not pa&s;s one
another upon it, without the mo&s;t imminent
hazard of being overturned. I am &s;till of
opinion that we excel the ancient Romans in
under&s;tanding the conveniencies of life.</P>
<P>The Grand Tour &s;ays, that within four
miles of Rome you &s;ee a tomb on the road|&s;ide,
&s;aid to be that of Nero, with &s;culpture
in ba&s;&s;o relievo at both ends. I did &s;ee &s;uch
a thing more like a common grave-&s;tone,
than the tomb of an emperor. But we are
informed by Suetonius, that the dead body of
Nero, who &s;lew him&s;elf at the villa of his
freedman, was by the care of his two nur&s;es
<PB N="82" REF="84">
and his concubine Atta, removed to the &s;e|pulchre
of the Gens Domitia, immediately
within the Porta del Popolo, on your left
hand as you enter Rome, preci&s;ely on the
&s;pot where now &s;tands the church of S. Maria
del Popolo. His tomb was even di&s;tingui&s;h|ed
by an epitaph, which has been pre&s;erved by
Gruterus. Giacomo Alberici tells us very
gravely in his Hi&s;tory of the Church, that a
great number of devils, who guarded the
bones of this wicked emperor, took po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion,
in the &s;hape of black ravens, of a wal|nut-tree,
which grew upon the &s;pot; from
whence they in&s;ulted every pa&s;&s;enger, until
pope Pa&s;chal II. in con&s;equence of a &s;olemn
fa&s;t and a revelation, went thither in proce&s;&s;ion
with his court and cardinals, cut down the
tree, burned it to a&s;hes, which, with the
bones of Nero, were thrown into the Tyber:
then he con&s;ecrated an altar on the place,
where afterwards the church was built. You
may gue&s;s what I felt at fir&s;t &s;ight of the city
of Rome, which, notwith&s;tanding all the ca|lamities
it has undergone, &s;till maintains an
augu&s;t and imperial appearance. It &s;tands
on the farther &s;ide of the Tyber, which we
<PB N="83" REF="85">
cro&s;&s;ed at the Ponte Molle, formerly called
Pons Milvius, about two miles from the gate
by which we entered. This bridge was built
by Aemilius Cen&s;or, who&s;e name it originally
bore. It was the road by which &s;o many
heroes returned with conque&s;t to their coun|try;
by which &s;o many kings were led cap|tive
to Rome; and by which the amba&s;&s;adors
of &s;o many kingdoms and &s;tates approached
the &s;eat of empire, to deprecate the wrath,
to &s;ollicit the friend&s;hip, or &s;ue for the pro|tection
of the Roman people. It is likewi&s;e
famous for the defeat and death of Maxentius,
who was here overcome by Con&s;tantine the
Great. The &s;pace between the bridge and
Porta del Popolo, on the right-hand, which
is now taken up with gardens and villas, was
part of the antient Campus Martius, where the
comitiae were held; and where the Roman peo|ple
inured them&s;elves to all manner of exerci&s;es:
it was adorned with porticos, temples, theatres,
baths, circi, ba&s;ilicae, obeli&s;ks, columns, &s;tatues,
and groves. Authors differ in their opinions
about the extent of it; but as they all agree
that it contained the Pantheon, the Circus
Agonis, now the Piazza Navona, the Bu&s;tum
<PB N="84" REF="86">
and Mau&s;oleum Augu&s;ti, great part of the
modern city mu&s;t be built upon the antient
Campus Martius. The highway that leads
from the bridge to the city, is part of the Via
Flaminia, which extended as far as Rimini;
and is well paved, like a modern &s;treet. No|thing
of the antient bridge remains but the
piles; nor is there any thing in the &s;tructure
of this, or of the other five Roman bridges
over the Tyber, that de&s;erves attention. I
have not &s;een any bridge in France or Italy,
comparable to that of We&s;tmin&s;ter, either in
beauty, magnificence, or &s;olidity; and when
the bridge at Black-Friars is fini&s;hed, it will
be &s;uch a monument of architecture as all the
world cannot parallel. As for the Tyber, it
is, in compari&s;on with the Thames, no more
than an incon&s;iderable &s;tream, foul, deep,
and rapid; navigable by &s;mall boats, barks,
and lighters; and, for the conveniency of
loading and unloading them, there is a hand|&s;ome
quay by the new cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, at the
Porto di Ripetta, provided with &s;tairs of
each &s;ide, and adorned with an elegant
fountain, that yields abundance of excellent
water.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="87">
We are told that the bed of this river has
been con&s;iderably rai&s;ed by the rubbi&s;h of old
Rome, and this is the rea&s;on u&s;ually given
for its being &s;o apt to overflow its banks.
A citizen of Rome told me, that a friend of
his lately digging to lay the foundation of a
new hou&s;e in the lower part of the city, near
the bank of the river, di&s;covered the pavement
of an antient &s;treet, at the depth of thirty-nine
feet from the pre&s;ent &s;urface of the
earth. He therefore concluded that modern
Rome is near forty feet higher in this place,
than the &s;ite of the antient city, and that the
bed of the river is rai&s;ed in proportion; but
this is altogether incredible. Had the bed of
the Tyber been antiently forty feet lower at
Rome, than it is at pre&s;ent, there mu&s;t have
been a fall or cataract in it immediately above
this tract, as it is not pretended that the bed
of it is rai&s;ed in any part above the city;
otherwi&s;e &s;uch an elevation would have ob|&s;tructed
its cour&s;e, and then it would have
overflowed the whole Campania. There is
nothing extraordinary in its pre&s;ent over|flowings:
they frequently happened of old,
and did great mi&s;chief to the antient city.
<PB N="86" REF="88">
Appian, Dio, and other hi&s;torians, de&s;cribe an
inundation of the Tiber immediately after
the death of Julius Cae&s;ar, which inundation
was occa&s;ioned by the &s;udden melting of a
great quantity of &s;now which had fallen upon
the Appenines. This calamity is recorded
by Horace in his ode to Augu&s;tus.</P>

The Porta del Popolo (formerly, Flami|nia,)
by which we entered Rome, is an ele|gant
piece of architecture, adorned with
marble columns and &s;tatues, and executed
after the de&s;ign of Buonaroti. Within &s;ide
you find your&s;elf in a noble piazza, from
whence three of the principal &s;treets of Rome
are detached. It is adorned with the famous
Aegyptian obeli&s;k, brought hither from the
Circus Maximus, and &s;et up by the archi|tect
Dominico Fontana in the pontificate of
Sixtus V. Here is likewi&s;e a beautiful foun|tain
de&s;igned by the &s;ame arti&s;t; and at the
beginning of the two principal &s;treets, are
two very elegant churches fronting each
other. Such an augu&s;t entrance cannot fail
to impre&s;s the &s;tranger with a &s;ublime idea of
this venerable city.</P>
<P>Having given our names at the gate, we
repaired to the dogana, or cu&s;tom-hou&s;e,
where our trunks and carriage were &s;earched;
and here we were &s;urrounded by a number of
&s;ervitori de piazza, offering their &s;ervices with
the mo&s;t di&s;agreable importunity. Though
I told them &s;everal times I had no occa&s;ion for
any, three of them took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
<PB N="88" REF="90">
coach, one mounting before and two of them
behind; and thus we proceeded to the Piazza
d'E&s;pagna, where the per&s;on lived to who&s;e
hou&s;e I was directed. Strangers that come to
Rome &s;eldom put up at public inns, but go
directly to lodging hou&s;es, of which there is
great plenty in this quarter. The Piazza
d'E&s;pagna is open, airy, and plea&s;antly &s;i|tuated
in a high part of the city immediately
under the Colla Pinciana, and adorned with
two fine fountains. Here mo&s;t of the Engli&s;h
re&s;ide: the apartments are generally commo|dious
and well furni&s;hed; and the lodgers
are well &s;upplied with provi&s;ions and all
nece&s;&s;aries of life. But, if I &s;tudied oeco|nomy,
I would choo&s;e another part of the
town than the Piazza d'E&s;pagna, which is,
be&s;ides, at a great di&s;tance from the anti|quities.
For a decent fir&s;t floor and two
bed-chambers on the &s;econd, I payed no
more than a &s;cudo (five &s;hillings) per day.
Our table was plentifully furni&s;hed by the
landlord for two and thirty pauls, being equal
to &s;ixteen &s;hillings. I hired a town-coach at
the rate of fourteen pauls, or &s;even &s;hillings a
day; and a &s;ervitore di piazza for three pauls,
<PB N="89" REF="91">
or eighteen-pence. The coachman has al&s;o
an allowance of two pauls a day. The pro|vi&s;ions
at Rome are rea&s;onable and good,
e&s;pecially the vitella mongana, which is the
mo&s;t delicate veal I ever ta&s;ted, but very dear,
being &s;old for two pauls, or a &s;hilling, the
pound. Here are the rich wines of Monte|pulciano,
Montefia&s;cone, and Monte di Dra|gone;
but what we commonly drink at meals
is that of Orvieto, a &s;mall white wine, of an
agreeable flavour. Strangers are generally
advi&s;ed to employ an antiquarian to in&s;truct
them in all the curio&s;ities of Rome; and
this is a nece&s;&s;ary expence, when a per&s;on
wants to become a connoi&s;&s;eur in painting,
&s;tatuary, and architecture. For my own part
I had no &s;uch ambition. I longed to view
the remains of antiquity by which this me|tropolis
is di&s;tingui&s;hed; and to contemplate
the originals of many pictures and &s;tatues,
which I had admired in prints and de&s;cripti|ons.
I therefore cho&s;e a &s;ervant, who was re|commended
to me as a &s;ober intelligent fel|low,
acquainted with the&s;e matters: at the
&s;ame time I furni&s;hed my&s;elf with maps and
plans of antient and modern Rome, toge|ther
<PB N="90" REF="92">
with the little manual, called, <HI>Itinerario
i&s;truttivo per ritrovare con facilita tutte le mag|nificenze
di Roma e di alcune citta', e ca&s;telli
&s;uburbani.</HI> But I found &s;till more &s;atisfaction
in peru&s;ing the book in three volumes, in|titled,
<HI>Roma antica, e moderna,</HI> which contains
a de&s;cription of every thing remarkable in
and about the city, illu&s;trated with a great
number of copper-plates, and many curious
hi&s;torical annotations. This directory co&s;t
me a zequine; but a hundred zequines will
not purcha&s;e all the books and prints which
have been publi&s;hed at Rome on the&s;e &s;ub|jects.
Of the&s;e the mo&s;t celebrated are the
plates of Piranefi, who is not only an ingeni|ous
architect and engraver, but al&s;o a learned
antiquarian; though he is apt to run riot in
his conjectures; and with regard to the arts
of antient Rome, has broached &s;ome doc|trines,
which he will find it very difficult to
maintain. Our young gentlemen who go to
Rome will do well to be upon their guard
again&s;t a &s;et of &s;harpers, (&s;ome of them of
our own country,) who deal in pictures and
antiques, and very often impo&s;e upon the
uninformed &s;tranger, by &s;elling him tra&s;h,
<PB N="91" REF="93">
as the productions of the mo&s;t celebrated
arti&s;ts. The Engli&s;h are more than any
other foreigners expo&s;ed to this impo&s;ition.
They are &s;uppo&s;ed to have more money to
throw away; and therefore a greater num|ber
of &s;nares are layed for them. This opi|nion
of their &s;uperior wealth they take a
pride in confirming, by launching out into
all manner of unnece&s;&s;ary expence: but,
what is &s;till more dangerous, the moment
they &s;et foot in Italy, they are &s;eized with the
ambition of becoming connoi&s;&s;eurs in paint|ing,
mu&s;ick, &s;tatuary, and architecture; and
the adventurers of this country do not fail
to flatter this weakne&s;s for their own advan|tage.
I have &s;een in different parts of Italy,
a number of raw boys, whom Britain &s;eemed
to have poured forth on purpo&s;e to bring her
national character into contempt: ignorant,
petulant, ra&s;h, and profligate, without any
knowledge or experience of their own, without
any director to improve their under&s;tanding,
or &s;uperintend their conduct. One engages
in play with an infamous game&s;ter, and is
&s;tripped perhaps in the very fir&s;t partie:
another is poxed and pillaged by an anti|quated
<PB N="92" REF="94">
cantatrice: a third is bubbled by a
knavi&s;h antiquarian; and a fourth is laid
under contribution by a dealer in pictures.
Some turn fiddlers, and pretend to compo&s;e:
but all of them talk familiarly of the arts,
and return fini&s;hed connoi&s;&s;eurs and cox|combs,
to their own country. The mo&s;t re|markable
phaenomenon of this kind, which
I have &s;een, is a boy of &s;eventy-two, now
actually travelling through Italy, for im|provement,
under the au&s;pices of another
boy of twenty-two. When you arrive at
Rome, you receive cards from all your coun|try-folks
in that city: they expect to have
the vi&s;it returned next day, when they give
orders not to be at home; and you never
&s;peak to one another in the &s;equel. This is
a refinement in ho&s;pitality and politene&s;s,
which the Engli&s;h have invented by the
&s;trength of their own genius, without any
a&s;&s;i&s;tance either from France, Italy, or Lap|land.
No Engli&s;hman above the degree of
a painter or cicerone frequents any coffee-hou&s;e
at Rome; and as there are no public
diver&s;ions, except in carnival-time, the only
chance you have for &s;eeing you compatriots,
<PB N="93" REF="95">
is either in vi&s;iting the curio&s;ities, or at a con|ver&s;azione.
The Italians are very &s;crupulous
in admitting foreigners, except tho&s;e who are
introduced as people of quality: but if there
happens to be any Engli&s;h lady of fa&s;hion at
Rome, &s;he generally keeps an a&s;&s;embly, to
which the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects re&s;ort. In my next,
I &s;hall communicate, without ceremony or
affectation, what further remarks I have
made at Rome, without any pretence, how|ever
to the character of a connoi&s;&s;eur, which,
without all doubt, would &s;it very aukwardly
upon,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXX.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Nice, <DATE>February 28, 1763.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NOTHING can be more agreeable to
the eyes of a &s;tranger, e&s;pecially in
the heats of &s;ummer, than the great num|ber
of public fountains that appear in every
part of Rome, embelli&s;hed with all the or|naments
of &s;culpture, and pouring forth
prodigious quantities of cool, delicious water,
brought in aqueducts from different lakes,
rivers, and &s;ources, at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance
from the city. The&s;e works are the remains
of the munificence and indu&s;try of the an|tient
Romans, who were extremely delicate
in the article of water: but, however, great
applau&s;e is al&s;o due to tho&s;e beneficent popes
who have been at the expence of re&s;toring
and repairing tho&s;e noble channels of health,
plea&s;ure, and convenience. This great plenty
of water, neverthele&s;s, has not induced the
Romans to be cleanly. Their &s;treets, and
<PB N="95" REF="97">
even their palaces, are di&s;graced with filth.
The noble Piazza Navona, is adorned with
three or four fountains, one of which is per|haps
the mo&s;t magnificent that Europe can
produce, and all of them di&s;charge va&s;t &s;treams
of water: but, notwith&s;tanding this pro|vi&s;ion,
the piazza is almo&s;t as dirty as We&s;t
Smithfield, where the cattle are &s;old in London.
The corridores, arcades, and even &s;tair-ca&s;es
belonging to their mo&s;t elegant palaces, are
depo&s;itories of na&s;tine&s;s, and indeed in &s;um|mer
&s;mell as &s;trong as &s;pirit of hart&s;horn.
I have a great notion that their ance&s;tors
were not much more cleanly. If we con|&s;ider
that the city and &s;uburbs of Rome, in
the reign of Claudius, contained about &s;even
millions of inhabitants, a number equal at
lea&s;t to the &s;um total of all the &s;ouls in Eng|land;
that great part of antient Rome was
allotted to temples, porticos, ba&s;ilicae, the|atres,
thermae, circi, public and private
walks and gardens, where very few, if any,
of this great number lodged; that by far
the greater part of tho&s;e inhabitants were
&s;laves and poor people, who did not enjoy the
conveniencies of life; and that the u&s;e of
<PB N="96" REF="98">
linen was &s;carce known; we mu&s;t naturally
conclude they were &s;trangely crouded toge|ther,
and that in general they were a very
frowzy generation. That they were crouded
together appears from the height of their
hou&s;es, which the poet Rutilius compared to
towers made for &s;caling heaven. In order to
remedy this inconvenience, Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar
publi&s;hed a decree, that for the future no
hou&s;es &s;hould be built above &s;eventy feet high,
which, at a moderate computation, might
make &s;ix &s;tories. But what &s;eems to prove,
beyond all di&s;pute, that the antient Romans
were dirty creatures, are the&s;e two particu|lars.
Ve&s;pa&s;ian laid a tax upon urine and
ordure, on pretence of being at a great ex|pence
in clearing the &s;treets from &s;uch nu|&s;ances;
an impo&s;ition which amounted to
about fourteen pence a year for every indi|vidual;
and when Heliogabalus ordered all
the cobwebs of the city and &s;uburbs to be
collected, they were found to weigh ten thou|&s;and
pounds. This was intended as a de|mon&s;tration
of the great number of inha|bitants;
but it was a proof of their dirt,
rather than of their populo&s;ity. I might
<PB N="97" REF="99">
likewi&s;e add, the delicate cu&s;tom of taking
vomits at each other's hou&s;es, when they were
invited to dinner, or &s;upper, that they might
prepare their &s;tomachs for gormandizing; a
bea&s;tly proof of their na&s;tine&s;s as well as
gluttony. Horace, in his de&s;cription of the
banquet of Na&s;iedenus, &s;ays, when the ca|nopy,
under which they &s;at, fell down, it
brought along with it as much dirt as is
rai&s;ed by a hard gale of wind in dry weather.
<Q><L>&mdash;&startq;trahentia pulveris atri,</L>
<L>Quantum non aquilo Campanis excitat agris.&endq;</L></Q>
I might ob&s;erve, that the &s;treets were often
encumbered with the putrifying carca&s;&s;es of
criminals, who had been dragged through
them by the heels, and precipitated from the
<HI>Scalae Gemoniae,</HI> or Tarpeian rock, before they
were thrown into the Tyber, which was the
general receptacle of the <HI>cloaca maxima</HI> and
all the filth of Rome: be&s;ides, the bodies of
all tho&s;e who made away with them&s;elves,
without &s;ufficient cau&s;e; of &s;uch as were
condemned for &s;acrilege, or killed by thun|der,
were left unburned and unburied, to rot
above ground.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="100">
I believe the moderns retain more of the
cu&s;toms of the antient Romans, than is ge|nerally
imagined. When I fir&s;t &s;aw the in|fants
at the <HI>enfans trouv&eacute;s</HI> in Paris, &s;o &s;wathed
with bandages, that the very &s;ight of them
made my eyes water, I little dreamed, that
the pre&s;cription of the antients could be
pleaded for this cu&s;tom, equally &s;hocking and
ab&s;urd: but in the Capitol at Rome, I met
with the antique &s;tatue of a child <HI>emaillot&eacute;</HI>
exactly in the &s;ame manner; rolled up like
an Aegyptian mummy from the feet. The
circulation of the blood, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, mu&s;t
be ob&s;tructed on the whole &s;urface of the
body; and nothing at liberty but the head,
which is the only part of the child that
ought to be confined. Is it not &s;urpri&s;ing
that common &s;en&s;e &s;hould not point out,
even to the mo&s;t ignorant, that tho&s;e ac|cur&s;ed
bandages mu&s;t heat the tender infant
into a fever; mu&s;t hinder the action of the
mu&s;cles, and the play of the joints, &s;o nece&s;|&s;ary
to health and nutrition; and that while
the refluent blood is ob&s;tructed in the veins,
which run on the &s;urface of the body, the
arteries, which lie deep, without the reach
<PB N="99" REF="101">
of compre&s;&s;ion, are continually pouring their
contents into the head, where the blood meets
with no re&s;i&s;tance? The ve&s;&s;els of the brain
are naturally lax, and the very futures of the
&s;kull are yet unclo&s;ed. What are the con&s;e|quences
of this cruel &s;waddling? the limbs
are wa&s;ted; the joints grow rickety; the
brain is compre&s;&s;ed, and a hydrocephalus,
with a great head and &s;ore eyes, en&s;ues. I
take this abominable practice to be one
great cau&s;e of the bandy legs, diminutive bo|dies,
and large heads, &s;o frequent in the &s;outh
of France, and in Italy.</P>
<P>I was no le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed to find the modern
fa&s;hion of curling the hair, borrowed in a
great mea&s;ure from the coxcombs and co|quettes
of antiquity. I &s;aw a bu&s;t of Nero
in the gallery at Florence, the hair repre&s;ented
in rows of buckles, like that of a French
petit-maitre, conformable to the picture drawn
of him by Suetonius. <HI>Circa cultum adeo pu|dendum,
ut coman &s;emper in gradus formatam
peregrinatione achaica, etiam pene verticem
&s;ump&s;erit.</HI> I was very &s;orry however to find that
this foppery came from Greece. As for Otho,
he wore a galericulum, or tour, on account
<PB N="100" REF="102">
of thin hair, <HI>propter raritatem capillorum.</HI>
He had no right to imitate the example of
Julius Cae&s;ar, who concealed his bald head
with a wreath of laurel. But there is a bu&s;t
in the Capitol of Julia Pia, the &s;econd wife
of Septimius Severus, with a moveable peruke,
dre&s;&s;ed exactly in the fa&s;hionable mode, with
this difference, that there is no part of it
frizzled; nor is there any appearance of po|matum
and powder. The&s;e improvements
the beau-monde have borrowed from the
natives of the Cape of Good Hope.</P>
<P>Modern Rome does not cover more than
one-third of the &s;pace within the walls; and
tho&s;e parts that were mo&s;t frequented of old
are now intirely abandoned. From the Ca|pitol
to the Coli&s;eum, including the Forum
Romanum and Boarium, there is nothing in|tire
but one or two churches, built with the
fragments of ancient edifices. You de&s;cend
from the Capitol between the remaining pil|lars
of two temples, the pede&s;tals and part of
the &s;hafts &s;unk in the rubbi&s;h: then pa&s;&s;ing
through the triumphal arch of Septimius Se|verus,
you proceed along the foot of Mons
Palatinus, which &s;tands on your right hand,
<PB N="101" REF="103">
quite covered with the ruins of the antient
palace belonging to the Roman emperors, and
at the foot of it, there are &s;ome beautiful de|tached
pillars &s;till &s;tanding. On the left you
&s;ee the remains of the <HI>Templum Pacis,</HI> which
&s;eems to have been the large&s;t and mo&s;t mag|nificent
of all the temples in Rome. It was
built and dedicated by the emperor Ve&s;pa&s;ian,
who brought into it all the trea&s;ure and preci|ous
ve&s;&s;els which he found in the temple of
Jeru&s;alem. The columns of the portico he
removed from Nero's golden hou&s;e, which he
levelled with the ground. This temple was
likewi&s;e famous for its library, mentioned by
Aulus Gellius. Farther on, is the arch of
Con&s;tantine on the right, a mo&s;t noble piece
of architecture, almo&s;t entire; with the re|mains
of the <HI>Meta Sudans</HI> before it; and front|ing
you, the noble ruins of that va&s;t amphi|theatre,
called the Colo&s;&s;aeum, now Coli&s;eo,
which has been di&s;mantled and dilapidated
by the Gothic popes and princes of modern
Rome, to build and adorn their paultry pa|laces.
Behind the amphitheatre were the
thermae of the &s;ame emperor Titus Ve&s;pa&s;ian.
In the &s;ame quarter was the <HI>Circus Maximus;</HI>
<PB N="102" REF="104">
and the whole &s;pace from hence on both &s;ides,
to the walls of Rome, comprehending above
twice as much ground as the modern city, is
almo&s;t covered with the monuments of anti|quity.
I &s;uppo&s;e there is more concealed
below ground than appears above. The mi|&s;erable
hou&s;es, and even garden-walls of the
pea&s;ants in this di&s;trict, are built with the&s;e
precious materials, I mean &s;hafts and capitals
of marble columns, heads, arms, legs, and
mutilated trunks of &s;tatues. What pity it
is that among all the remains of antiquity, at
Rome, there is not one lodging-hou&s;e re|maining.
I &s;hould be glad to know how the
&s;enators of Rome were lodged. I want to
be better informed touching the <HI>cava oedium,</HI>
the <HI>focus,</HI> the <HI>ara deorum penatum,</HI> the <HI>concla|via,
trilinica,</HI> and <HI>coenationes;</HI> the <HI>atria</HI> where
the women re&s;ided, and employed them&s;elves
in the woolen manufacture; the <HI>proetoria,</HI>
which were &s;o &s;pacious as to become a nu|$ance
in the reign of Augu&s;tus; and the
<HI>Xy&s;ta,</HI> which were &s;hady walks between two
porticos, where the men exerci&s;ed them&s;elves in
the winter. I am di&s;gu&s;ted by the modern
ta&s;te of architecture, though I am no judge
<PB N="103" REF="105">
of the art. The churches and palaces of
the&s;e days are crowded with petty orna|ments,
which di&s;tract the eye, and by break|ing
the de&s;ign into a variety of little parts,
de&s;troy the effect of the whole. Every door
and window has its &s;eparate ornaments, its
moulding, frize, cornice, and tympanum;
then there is &s;uch an a&s;&s;emblage of u&s;ele&s;s
fe&s;toons, pillars, pila&s;ters, with their archi|traves,
entablatures, and I know not what,
that nothing great or uniform remains to fill
the view; and we in vain look for that &s;im|plicity
of grandeur, tho&s;e large ma&s;&s;es of light
and &s;hadow, and the inexpre&s;&s;ible <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">,
which characteri&s;e the edifices of the
antients. A great edifice, to have its full
effect, ought to be <HI>i&s;ol&eacute;,</HI> that is detached from
all others, with a large &s;pace around it: but
the palaces of Rome, and indeed of all the
other cities of Italy, which I have &s;een, are
&s;o engaged among other mean hou&s;es, that
their beauty and magnificence are in a great
mea&s;ure concealed. Even tho&s;e which face
open &s;treets and piazzas are only clear in
front. The other apartments are darkened
by the vicinity of ordinary hou&s;es; and their
<PB N="104" REF="106">
views are confined by dirty and di&s;agreeable
objects. Within the court there is generally
a noble colonnade all round, and an open
corridore above: but the &s;tairs are u&s;ually
narrow, &s;teep, and high: the want of fa&s;h|windows,
the dullne&s;s of their &s;mall gla&s;s
lozenges, the du&s;ty brick floors, and the
crim&s;on hangings laced with gold, contribute
to give a gloomy air to their apartments; I
might add to the&s;e cau&s;es, a number of pic|tures
executed on melancholy &s;ubjects, an|tique
mutilated &s;tatues, bu&s;ts, ba&s;&s;o relievos,
urns, and &s;epulchral &s;tones, with which their
rooms are adorned. It mu&s;t be owned, how|ever,
there are &s;ome exceptions to this general
rule. The villa of cardinal Alexander Al|bani
is light, gay, and airy; yet the rooms
are too &s;mall, and too much decorated with
carving and gilding, which is a kind of
gingerbread work. The apartments of one
of the princes Borghe&s;e are furni&s;hed in the
Engli&s;h ta&s;te; and in the <HI>palazzo di colonna
conne&s;tabile,</HI> there is a &s;aloon, or gallery, which,
for the proportions, lights, furniture, and or|naments,
is the mo&s;t noble, elegant, and agree|able
apratment I ever &s;aw.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="107">
It is diverting to hear an Ialian expatiate
upon the greatne&s;s of modern Rome. He
will tell you there are above three hundred
palaces in the city; that there is &s;carce a
Roman prince, who&s;e revenue does not ex|ceed
two hundred thou&s;and crowns; and that
Rome produces not only the mo&s;t learned
men, but al&s;o the mo&s;t refined politicians in
the univer&s;e. To one of them talking in this
&s;train, I replied, that in&s;tead of three hun|dred
palaces, the number did not exceed
four&s;core; that I had been informed, on good
authority, there were not &s;ix individuals in
Rome who had &s;o much as forty thou&s;and
crowns a year, about ten thou&s;and pounds
&s;terling; and that to &s;ay their princes were
&s;o rich, and their politicians &s;o refined, was,
in effect, a &s;evere &s;$$tire upon them, for not
employing their wealth and their talents for
the advantage of their country. I a&s;ked why
their cardinals and princes did not invite and
encourage indu&s;trious people to &s;ettle and
cultivate the Campania of Rome, which is a
de&s;ert? why they did not rai&s;e a &s;ub&s;cription
to drain the mar&s;hes in the neighbourhood
<PB N="106" REF="108">
of the city, and thus meliorate the air, which
is rendered extremely unwhol&s;ome in the
&s;ummer, by putrid exhalations from tho&s;e
mora&s;&s;es? I demanded of them, why they
did not contribute their wealth, and exert
their political refinements, in augmenting
their forces by &s;ea and land, for the defence of
their country, introducing commerce and
manufactures, and in giving &s;ome con&s;e|quence
to their &s;tate, which was no more
than a mite in the political &s;cale of Europe?
I expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire to know what became of
all tho&s;e &s;ums of money, ina&s;much as there
was hardly any circulation of gold and &s;ilver
in Rome, and the very bankers, on whom
&s;trangers have their credit, make intere&s;t to
pay their trade&s;men's bills with paper notes
of the bank of Spirito Santo? And now I
am upon this &s;ubject, it may not be ami&s;s to
ob&s;erve that I was &s;trangely mi&s;led by all the
books I con&s;ulted about the current coin of Italy.
In Tu&s;cany, and the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical State, one
&s;ees nothing but zequines in gold, and pieces
of two paoli, one paolo, and half a paolo,
in &s;ilver. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there is a copper coin
<PB N="107" REF="109">
at Rome, called bajocco and mezzo bajocco.
Ten bajocchi make a &s;cudo, which is an
imaginary piece: two &s;cudi make a ze|quine;
and a French loui'dore is worth
about two zequines.</P>
<P>Rome has nothing to fear from the catho|lic
powers, who re&s;pect it with a &s;uper&s;titious
veneration as the metropolitan &s;eat of their
religion: but the popes will do well to avoid
mi&s;under&s;tandings with the maritime prote&s;|tant
&s;tates, e&s;pecially the Engli&s;h, who being
ma&s;ters of the Mediterranean, and in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
of Minorca, have it in their power at
all times, to land a body of troops within
four leagues of Rome, and to take the city,
without oppo&s;ition. Rome is &s;urrounded
with an old wall, but altogether incapable of
defence. Or if it was, the circuit of the
walls is &s;o exten&s;ive, that it would require a
garri&s;on of twenty thou&s;and men. The only
appearance of a fortification in this city, is
the ca&s;tle of St. Angelo, &s;ituated on the fur|ther
bank of the Tyber, to which there is
acce&s;s by a hand&s;ome bridge: but this ca&s;tle,
which was formerly the <HI>moles Adriani,</HI> could
<PB N="108" REF="110">
not hold out half a day again&s;t a battery of
ten pieces of cannon properly directed. It
was an expedient left to the invention of the
modern Romans, to convert an ancient tomb
into a citadel. It could only &s;erve as a tem|porary
retreat for the pope in times of po|pular
commotion, and on other &s;udden emer|gencies;
as it happened in the ca&s;e of pope
Clement VII. when the troops of the emperor
took the city by a&s;&s;ault; and this only, while
he re&s;ided at the Vatican, from whence there
is a covered gallery continued to the ca&s;tle:
it can never &s;erve this purpo&s;e again, while
the pontiff lives on Monte Cavallo, which is
at the other end of the city. The ca&s;tle of
St. Angelo, how&s;oever ridiculous as a fortre&s;s,
appears re&s;pectable as a noble monument of
antiquity, and though &s;tanding in a low
&s;ituation, is one of the fir&s;t objects that &s;trike
the eye of a &s;tranger approaching Rome.
On the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river, are the
wretched remains of the Mau&s;oleum Augu&s;ti,
which was &s;till more magnificent. Part of
the walls is &s;tanding, and the terraces are
converted into garden-ground. In viewing
<PB N="109" REF="111">
the&s;e ruins, I remembered Virgil's pathetic
de&s;cription of Marcellus, who was here in|tombed.
<Q><L>Quantos ille virum, magnum mavortis ad urbem.</L>
<L>Campus aget gemitus, vel que Tyberine, videbis</L>
<L>Funera, cum tumulum preter labere recentem.</L></Q>
The beautiful poem of Ovid <HI>de Con&s;olatione
ad Liviam,</HI> written after the a&s;hes of Au|gu&s;tus
and his nephew Marcellus, of Ger|manicus,
Agrippa, and Dru&s;us, were de|po&s;ited
in this mau&s;oleum, concludes with
the&s;e lines, which are extremely tender:
<Q><L>Claudite jam Parcae $hnimium re&s;erata &s;epulchra;</L>
<L>Claudite, plus ju&s;to, jam domus i&s;ta patet!</L></Q>
What the author &s;aid of the monument,
you will be tempted to &s;ay of this letter,

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my la&s;t I gave you my opinion freely
of the modern palaces of Italy. I &s;hall
now hazard my thoughts upon the gardens
of this country, which the inhabitants extol
with all the hyperboles of admiration and ap|plau&s;e.
I mu&s;t acknowledge however, I have
not &s;een the famous villas at Fra&s;cati and
Tivoli, which are celebrated for their gardens
and water-works. I intended to vi&s;it the&s;e
places; but was prevented by an unexpected
change of weather, which deterred me from
going to the country. On the la&s;t day of
September the mountains of Pale&s;trina were
covered with &s;now; and the air became &s;o
cold at Rome, that I was forced to put on my
winter cloaths. This objection continued, till
I found it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;et out on my return
to Florence. But I have &s;een the gardens of
the <HI>Poggio Imperiale,</HI> and the <HI>Palazzo de Pitt$</HI>
<PB N="111" REF="113">
at Florence, and tho&s;e of the Vatican, of the
pope's palace on Monte Cavallo, of the Villa
Ludovi&s;ia, Medicea, and Pinciana, at Rome;
&s;o that I think I have &s;ome right to judge of
the Italian ta&s;te in gardening. Among tho&s;e
I have mentioned, that of the Villa Pinciana,
is the mo&s;t remarkable, and the mo&s;t exten|&s;ive,
including a &s;pace of three miles in cir|cuit,
hard by the walls of Rome, containing
a variety of &s;ituations high and low, which
favour all the natural embelli&s;hments one
would expect to meet with in a garden, and
exhibit a diver&s;ity of noble views of the city
and adjacent country.</P>
<P>In a fine exten&s;ive garden or park, an
Engli&s;hman expects to &s;ee a number of groves
and glades, intermixed with an agreeable ne|gligence,
which &s;eems to be the effect of na|ture
and accident. He looks for &s;hady walks
encru&s;ted with gravel; for open lawns covered
with verdure as &s;mooth as velvet, but much
more lively and agreeable; for ponds, canals,
ba&s;ins, ca&s;cades, and running &s;treams of wa|ter;
for clumps of trees, woods, and wilder|ne&s;&s;es,
cut into delightful alleys, perfumed
with honey-&s;uckle and &s;weet-briar, and re|&s;ounding
<PB N="112" REF="114">
with the mingled melody of all the
&s;inging birds of heaven: he looks for plats
of flowers in different parts to refre&s;h the
&s;en&s;e, and plea&s;e the fancy; for arbours,
grottos, hermitages, temples, and alcoves, to
&s;helter him from the &s;un, and afford him
means of contemplation and repo&s;e; and he
expects to find the hedges, groves, and walks,
and lawns kept with the utmo&s;t order and
propriety. He who loves the beauties of
&s;imple nature, and the charms of neatne&s;s,
will &s;eek for them in vain amid&s;t the groves
of Italy. In the garden of the Villa Pinciana,
there is a plantation of four hundred pines,
or rather firs, which the Italians view with
rapture and admiration: there is likewi&s;e a
long walk, of trees extending from the garden|gate
to the palace; and plenty of &s;hade, with
alleys and hedges in different parts of the
ground: but the groves are neglected; the
walks are laid with nothing but common
mould or &s;and, black and du&s;ty; the hedges
are tall, thin and &s;habby; the trees &s;tunted;
the open ground, brown and parched, has
&s;carce any appearance of verdure. The flat,
regular alleys of evergreens are cut into
<PB N="113" REF="115">
fanta&s;tic figures; the flower gardens embel|li&s;hed
with thin cyphers and flouri&s;hed figures
in box, while the flowers grow in rows of
earthen-pots, and the ground appears as
du&s;ky as if it was covered with the cinders
of a black&s;mith's forge. The water, of which
there is great plenty, in&s;tead of being col|lected
in large pieces, or conveyed in little
rivulets and &s;treams to refre&s;h the thir&s;ty &s;oil,
or managed &s;o as to form agreeable ca&s;cades,
is &s;quirted from fountains in different parts
of the garden, through tubes little bigger
than common gly&s;ter-pipes. It mu&s;t be
owned indeed that the fountains have their
merit in the way of &s;culpture and architec|ture;
and that here is a great number of
&s;tatues which merit attention: but they &s;erve
only to encumber the ground, and de&s;troy that
effect of rural &s;implicity, which our gardens
are de&s;igned to produce. In a word, here we
&s;ee a variety of walks and groves and foun|tains,
a wood of four hundred pines, a pad|dock
with a few meagre deer, a flower-gar|den,
an $aviary, a grotto, and a fi&s;h-pond;
and in &s;pite of all the&s;e particulars, it is, in
my opinion, a very contemptible garden,
<PB N="114" REF="116">
when compared to that of Stowe in Bucking|ham&s;hire,
or even to tho&s;e of Ken&s;ington and
Richmond. The Italians under&s;tand, be|cau&s;e
they &s;tudy, the excellencies of art; but
they have no idea of the beauties of nature.
This Villa Pinciana, which belongs to the
Borghe&s;e family, would make a complete
academy for painting and &s;culpture, e&s;peci|ally
for the &s;tudy of antient marbles; for,
exclu&s;ive of the &s;tatues and bu&s;ts in the gar|den,
and the va&s;t collection in the different
apartments, almo&s;t the whole out&s;ide of the
hou&s;e is covered with curious pieces in ba&s;&s;o
and alto relievo. The mo&s;t ma&s;terly is that
of Curtius on hor&s;eback, leaping into the
gulph or opening of the earth, which is &s;aid
to have clo&s;ed on receiving this &s;acrifice.
Among the exhibitions of art within the
hou&s;e, I was much &s;truck with a Bacchus,
and the death of Meleager, repre&s;ented on
an antient &s;epulchre. There is al&s;o an ad|mirable
&s;tatue of Silenus, with the infant
Bacchus in his arms; a mo&s;t beautiful gla|diator;
a curious Moor of black marble,
with a &s;hirt of white alaba&s;ter; a finely pro|portioned
bull of black marble al&s;o, &s;tanding
<PB N="115" REF="117">
upon a table of alaba&s;ter; a black gip&s;ey
with a head, hands, and feet of bra&s;s; and
the famous hermaphrodite, which vies with
that of Florence: though the mo&s;t curious
circum&s;tance of this article, is the mattra&s;s
executed and placed by Bernini, with &s;uch art
and dexterity, that to the view, it rivals the
&s;oftne&s;s of wool, and &s;eems to retain the
marks of pre&s;&s;ure, according to the figure of
the &s;uperincumbent &s;tatue. Let us likewi&s;e
own, for the honour of the moderns, that
the &s;ame arti&s;t has produced two fine &s;tatues,
which we find among the ornaments of this
villa, namely, a David with his &s;ling in the
attitude of throwing the &s;tone at the giant
Goliah; and a Daphne changing into laurel
at the approach of Apollo. On the ba&s;e of
this figure, are the two following elegant
lines, written by pope Urban VIII. in his
younger years.
<Q><L>Qui&s;quis amans &s;equitur fugitiv$$ gaudia formoe,</L>
<L>Fronde manus implet, baccas vel carpit amaras.</L></Q>
I ought not to forget two exqui&s;ite antique
&s;tatues of Venus, the weeping &s;lave, and the
youth pulling a thorn out of his foot.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="118">
I do not pretend to give a methodical de|tail
of the curio&s;ities of Rome: they have
been already de&s;cribed by different authors,
who were much better qualified than I am
for the ta&s;k: but you &s;hall have what ob|&s;ervations
I made on the mo&s;t remarkable
objects, without method, ju&s;t as they occur
to my remembrance; and I prote&s;t the re|marks
are all my own: &s;o that if they de|&s;erve
any commendation, I claim all the
merit; and if they are impertinent, I mu&s;t
be contented to bear all the blame.</P>
<P>The piazza of St. Peter's church is altoge|ther
&s;ublime. The double colonnade on each
&s;ide extending in a &s;emi-circular &s;weep, the
&s;tupendous AEgyptian obeli&s;k, the two foun|tains,
the portico, and the admirable fa&ccedil;ade of
the church, form &s;uch an a&s;&s;emblage of mag|nificent
objects, as cannot fail to impre&s;s the
mind with awe and admiration: but the
church would have produced a &s;till greater
effect, had it been detached entirely from the
buildings of the Vatican. It would then
have been a ma&s;ter-piece of architecture,
complete in all its parts, intire and perfect:
whereas, at pre&s;ent, it is no more than a beau|tiful
<PB N="117" REF="119">
member attached to a va&s;t undige&s;ted
and irregular pile of building. As to the
architecture of this famous temple, I &s;hall
&s;ay nothing; neither do I pretend to de&s;cribe
the internal ornaments. The great picture
of Mo&s;aic work, and that of St. Peter's
bark to&s;&s;ed by the tempe&s;t, which appear
over the gate of the church, though rude in
compari&s;on with modern pieces, are never|thele&s;s
great curio&s;ities, when con&s;idered as
the work of Giotto, who flouri&s;hed in the
beginning of the fourteenth century. His
ma&s;ter was Cimabue, who learned painting
and architecture of the Grecian arti&s;ts, who
came from Con&s;tantinople, and fir&s;t revived
the&s;e arts in Italy. But, to return to St. Pe|ter's,
I was not at all plea&s;ed with the famous
&s;tatue of the dead Chri&s;t in his mother's lap,
by Michael Angelo. The figure of Chri&s;t is
as much emaciated, as if he had died of a
con&s;umption: be&s;ides, there is &s;omething in|delicate,
not to &s;ay indecent, in the attitude
and de&s;ign of a man's body, &s;tark naked,
lying upon the knees of a woman. Here are
&s;ome good pictures, I &s;hould rather &s;ay copies
of good pictures, done in Mo&s;aic to great per|fection;
<PB N="118" REF="120">
particularly a St. Seba&s;tian by Dome|nichino,
and Michael the Archangel, from a
painting of Guido Rheni. I am extremely
fond of all this arti&s;t's pieces. There is a
tenderne&s;s and delicacy in his manner; and
his figures are all exqui&s;itely beautiful, though
his expre&s;&s;ion is often erroneous, and his atti|tudes
are always affected and unnatural. In
this very piece the archangel has all the air of
a French dancing-ma&s;ter; and I have &s;een a
Madonna by the &s;ame hand, I think it is in
the Palazzo di Barberini, in which, though
the figures are enchanting, the Virgin is re|pre&s;ented
holding up the drapery of the In|fant,
with the ridiculous affectation of a
&s;inger on the &s;tage of our Italian opera.
The Mo&s;aic work, though brought to a
wonderful degree of improvement, and ad|mirably
calculated for churches, the damp|ne&s;s
of which is pernicious to the colours of
the pallet, I will not yet compare to the pro|ductions
of the pencil. The gla&s;&s;yne&s;s (if I
may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion) of the &s;ur|face,
throws, in my opinion, a fal&s;e light on
&s;ome parts of the picture; and when you ap|proach
it, the joinings of the pieces look like
<PB N="119" REF="121">
&s;o many cracks on painted canvas. Be&s;ides,
this method is extremely tedious and expen|&s;ive.
I went to &s;ee the arti&s;ts at work, in a
hou&s;e that &s;tands near the church, where I
was much plea&s;ed with the ingenuity of the
proce&s;s; and not a little &s;urprized at the great
number of different colours and tints, which
are kept in &s;eparate draws, marked with num|bers
as far as &s;eventeen thou&s;and. For a &s;ingle
head done in Mo&s;aic, they a&s;ked me fifty
zequines. But to return to the church. The
altar of St. Peter's choir, notwith&s;tanding all
the ornaments which have been lavi&s;hed upon
it, is no more than a heap of puerile finery,
better adapted to an Indian pagod, than to a
temple built upon the principles of the Greek
architecture. The four colo&s;&s;al figures that
&s;upport the chair, are both clum&s;y and di&s;|proportioned.
The drapery of &s;tatues, whe|ther
in bra&s;s or &s;tone, when thrown into
large ma&s;&s;es, appears hard and unplea&s;ant to
the eye; and for that rea&s;on the antients al|ways
imitated wet linen, which exhibiting the
&s;hape of the limbs underneath, and hanging
in a multiplicity of wet folds, gives an air of
lightne&s;s, &s;oftne&s;s, and ductility to the whole.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="122">
The&s;e two &s;tatues weigh 116257 pounds,
and as they &s;u&s;tain nothing but a chair, are
out of all proportion, ina&s;much as the &s;up|porters
ought to be &s;uitable to the things &s;up|ported.
Here are four giants holding up the
old wooden chair of the apo&s;tle Peter, if
we may believe the book <HI>De Identitate Cathe|drae
Romanae.</HI> The implements of popi&s;h
&s;uper&s;tition; &s;uch as relicks of pretended
&s;aints, ill proportioned &s;pires and bellfreys,
and the nau&s;eous repetition of the figure of
the cro&s;s, which is in it&s;elf a very mean and
di&s;agreeable object, only fit for the pri&s;ons of
condemned criminals, have contributed to
introduce a vitious ta&s;te into the external ar|chitecture,
as well as in the internal orna|ments
of our temples. All churches are
built in the figure of a cro&s;s, which effectu|ally
prevents the eye from taking in the &s;cope
of the building, either without &s;ide or with|in;
con&s;equently robs the edifice of its pro|per
effect. The palace of the E&s;curial in
Spain is laid out in the &s;hape of a gridiron,
becau&s;e the convent was built in con&s;equence
of a vow to St. Laurence, who was broiled
to death like a barbecued pig. What pity it
<PB N="121" REF="123">
is, that the labours of painting &s;hould have
been &s;o much employed on the &s;hocking &s;ub|jects
of the martyrology. Be&s;ides number|le&s;s
pictures of the flagellation, crucifixion,
and de&s;cent from the cro&s;s, we have Judith
with the head of Holofernes, Herodias with
the head of John the Bapti&s;t, Jael a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inat|ing
Si&s;era in his &s;leep, Peter writhing on the
cro&s;s, Stephen battered with &s;tones, Seba&s;tian
&s;tuck full of arrows, Laurence frying upon
the coals, Bartholomew fleaed alive, and a
hundred other pictures equally frightful,
which can only &s;erve to fill the mind with
gloomy ideas, and encourage a &s;pirit of reli|gious
fanatici&s;m, which has always been at|tended
with mi&s;chievous con&s;equences to the
community where it reigned.</P>
<P>The tribune of the great altar, con&s;i&s;ting
of four wreathed bra&s;s pillars, gilt, &s;up|porting
a canopy, is doubtle&s;s very magnifi|cent,
if not over-charged with &s;culpture,
fluting, foliage, fe&s;toons, and figures of boys
and angels, which, with the hundred and
twenty-two lamps of &s;ilver, continually burn|ing
below, &s;erve rather to dazzle the eyes, and
kindle the devotion of the ignorant vulgar,
<PB N="122" REF="124">
than to excite the admiration of a judicious
ob&s;erver.</P>
<P>There is nothing, I believe, in this famous
&s;tructure, &s;o worthy of applau&s;e, as the ad|mirable
&s;ymmetry and proportion of its parts.
Notwith&s;tanding all the carving, gilding, ba&s;&s;o
relievos, medallions, urns, &s;tatues, columns,
and pictures with which it abounds, it does
not, on the whole, appear over-crouded with
ornaments. When you fir&s;t enter, your eye
is filled &s;o equally and regularly, that nothing
appears &s;tupendous; and the church &s;eems
con&s;iderably &s;maller than it really is. The
&s;tatues of children, that &s;upport the founts of
holy water when ob&s;erved from the door,
&s;eem to be of the natural &s;ize; but as you
draw near, you perceive they are gigantic.
In the &s;ame manner, the figures of the doves,
with olive branches in their beaks, which are
repre&s;ented on the wall, appear to be within
your reach; but as you approach them, they
recede to a con&s;iderable height, as if they had
flown upwards to avoid being taken.</P>
<P>I was much di&s;appointed at &s;ight of the
Pantheon, which, after all that has been &s;aid
of it, looks like a huge cockpit, open at top.
<PB N="123" REF="125">
The portico which Agrippa added to the
building, is undoubtedly very noble, though,
in my opinion, it corre&s;ponds but ill with the
&s;implicity of the edifice. With all my venera|tion
for the antients, I cannot &s;ee in what the
beauty of the rotunda con&s;i&s;ts. It is no more
than a plain unpierced cylinder, or circular
wall, with two fillets and a cornice, having a
vaulted roof or cupola, open in the centre.
I mean the original building, without con&s;i|dering
the ve&s;tibule of Agrippa. Within &s;ide
it has much the air of a mau&s;oleum. It was
this appearance which, in all probability, &s;ug|ge&s;ted
the thought to Boniface IV. to tran&s;port
hither eight and twenty cart-loads of old rot|ten
bones, dug from different burying-places,
and then dedicate it as a church to the ble&s;&s;ed
Virgin and all the holy martyrs. I am not
one of tho&s;e who think it is well lighted by
the hole at the top, which is about nine and
twenty feet in diameter, although the author
of the Grand Tour calls it but nine. The
fame author &s;ays, there is a de&s;cent of eleven
&s;teps to go into it; that it is a hundred and
forty-four feet in heighth, and as many in
breadth; that it was covered with copper,
<PB N="124" REF="126">
which, with the bra&s;s nails of the portico,
pope Urban VIII. took away, and converted
into the four wreathed pillars that &s;upport
the canopy of the high altar in the church
of St. Peter, &amp;c. The truth is, before the
time of pope Alexander VII. the earth was
&s;o rai&s;ed as to cover part of the temple, and
there was a de&s;cent of &s;ome &s;teps into
the porch: but that pontiff ordered the
ground to be pared away to the very pede&s;tal
or ba&s;e of the portico, which is now even
with the &s;treet, &s;o that there is no de&s;cent
what&s;oever. The height is two hundred
palmi, and the breadth two hundred and
eighteen; which, reckoning the palmi at
nine inches, will bring the height to one
hundred and fifty, and the breadth to one
hundred and &s;ixty-three feet &s;ix inches. It
was not any covering of copper which pope
Urban VIII. removed, but large bra&s;s beams,
which &s;upported the roof of the portico.
They weighed 186392 pounds; and afforded
metal enough not only for the pillars in St.
Peter's church, but al&s;o for &s;everal pieces of
artillery. What is more extraordinary, the
gilding of tho&s;e columns is &s;aid to have co&s;t
<PB N="125" REF="127">
forty thou&s;and golden crowns: &s;ure money
was never wor&s;e laid out. Urban VIII. like|wi&s;e
added two bellfrey towers to the rotunda;
and I wonder he did not cover the central hole
with gla&s;s, as it mu&s;t be very inconvenient and
di&s;agreeable to tho&s;e who go to church below,
to be expo&s;ed to the rain in wet weather,
which mu&s;t al&s;o render it very damp and un|whole&s;ome.
I vi&s;ited it &s;everal times, and
each time it looked more and more gloomy
and &s;epulchral.</P>
<P>The magnificence of the Romans was not
&s;o con&s;picuous in their temples, as in their
theatres, amphitheatres, circu&s;&s;es, naumachia,
aqueducts, triumphal arches, porticoes, ba&s;i|licae,
but e&s;pecially their thermae, or bathing-places.
A great number of their temples
were &s;mall and incon&s;iderable; not one of
them was comparable either for &s;ize or mag|nificence,
to the modern church of St. Peter
of the Vatican. The famous temple of Jupi|ter
Capitolinus was neither half &s;o long, nor
half &s;o broad: it was but two hundred feet in
length, and one hundred and eighty-five in
breadth; whereas the length of St. Peter's
extends to &s;ix hundred and thirty-eight feet,
<PB N="126" REF="128">
and the breadth to above five hundred. It is
very near twice as large as the temple of Ju|piter
Olympius in Greece, which was counted
one of the &s;even wonders of the world. But
I &s;hall take another opportunity to explain
my&s;elf further on the antiquities of this
city; a &s;ubject, upon which I am di&s;po&s;ed
to be (perhaps impertinently) circum&s;tantial.
When I begin to run riot, you &s;hould check
me with the freedom of a friend. The mo&s;t

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Colo&s;&s;aeum or amphitheatre built
by Flavius Ve&s;pa&s;ian, is the mo&s;t &s;tu|pendous
work of the kind which antiquity
can produce. Near one half of the external
circuit &s;till remains, con&s;i&s;ting of four tire of
arcades, adorned with columns of four or|ders,
Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and Compo&s;ite.
The height and extent of it may be gue&s;&s;ed
from the number of &s;pectators it contained,
amounting to one hundred thou&s;and; and yet,
according to Fontana's men&s;uration, it could
not contain above thirty-four thou&s;and per|&s;ons
fitting, allowing a foot and an half for
each per&s;on: for the circuit of the whole
building did not exceed one thou&s;and five hun|dred
and &s;ixty feet. The amphitheatre at
Verona is one thou&s;and two hundred and
ninety feet in circumference; and that of
<PB N="128" REF="130">
Ni&s;mes, one thou&s;and and eighty. The Co|lo&s;&s;aeum
was built by Ve&s;pa&s;ian, who employed
thirty thou&s;and Jewi&s;h &s;laves in the work;
but fini&s;hed and dedicated by his &s;on Titus,
who, on the fir&s;t day of its being opened, pro|duced
fifty thou&s;and wild bea&s;ts, which were
all killed in the arena. The Romans were
undoubtedly a barbarous people, who de|lighted
in horrible &s;pectacles. They viewed
with plea&s;ure the dead bodies of criminals
dragged through the &s;treets, or thrown down
the Scalae Gemoniae and Tarpeian rock, for
their contemplation. Their ro&s;tra were gene|rally
adorned with the heads of &s;ome remark|able
citizens, like Temple-Bar, at London.
They even bore the &s;ight of Tully's head
fixed upon that very ro&s;trum where he had
&s;o often ravi&s;hed their ears with all the charms
of eloquence, in pleading the cau&s;e of inno|cence
and public virtue. They took delight
in &s;eeing their fellow-creatures torn in pieces
by wild bea&s;ts, in the amphitheatre. They
&s;houted with applau&s;e when they &s;aw a poor
dwarf or &s;lave killed by his adver&s;ary; but
their tran&s;ports were altogether extravagant,
when the devoted captives were obliged to
<PB N="129" REF="131">
fight in troops, till one &s;ide was entirely
butchered by the other. Nero produced four
hundred &s;enators, and &s;ix hundred of the
eque&s;trian order, as gladiators in the public
arena: even the women fought with wild
bea&s;ts, as well as with each other, and
drenched the amphitheatres with their blood.
Tacitus &s;ays, &startq;<HI>Sed faeminarum illu&s;trium,
&s;enatorumque filiorum plures per arenam faedati
&s;unt.</HI>&endq; The execrable cu&s;tom of &s;acrificing
captives or &s;laves at the tombs of their ma&s;ters
and great men, which is &s;till pre&s;erved among

the antients, Greeks as well as Romans. I
could never, without horror and indignation,
read that pa&s;&s;age in the twenty-third book of
the Iliad, which de&s;cribes twelve valiant Tro|jan
captives &s;acrificed by the inhuman Achilles
at the tomb of his friend Patroclus.

It is not at all clear to me, that a people is

True bravery is not &s;avage but humane.
<PB N="301" REF="132">
Some of this &s;anguinary &s;pirit is inherited by
the inhabitants of a certain i&s;land that &s;hall
be namele&s;s&mdash;but, mum for that. You will
naturally &s;uppo&s;e that the Coli&s;eo was ruined
by the barbarians who &s;acked the city of
Rome: in effect, they robbed it of its orna|ments
and valuable materials; but it was re|&s;erved
for the Goths and Vandals of modern
Rome, to di&s;mantle the edifice, and reduce it
to its pre&s;ent ruinous condition. One part of
it was demoli&s;hed by pope Paul II. that he
might employ the &s;tones of it in building the
palace of St. Mark. It was afterwards di|lapidated
for the &s;ame purpo&s;es, by the car|dinals
Riarius and Farne&s;e, which la&s;t a&s;&s;umed
the tiara under the name of Paul III. Not|with&s;tanding
the&s;e injuries, there is enough
&s;tanding to convey a very &s;ublime idea of
antient magnificence.</P>
<P>The Circi and Naumachia, if con&s;idered
as buildings and artificial ba&s;ins, are admira|ble;
but if examined as areae intended for
hor&s;e and chariot-races, and artificial &s;eas for
exhibiting naval engagements, they &s;eem to
prove that the antient Romans were but in|differently
&s;killed and exerci&s;ed either in hor&s;e|man&s;hip
<PB N="131" REF="133">
or naval armaments. The inclo|&s;ure
of the emperor Caracalla's circus is &s;till
&s;tanding, and &s;carce affords breathing room
for an Engli&s;h hunter. The Circus Maximus,
by far the large&s;t in Rome, was not &s;o long as
the Mall; and I will venture to affirm, that
St. James's Park would make a much more
ample and convenient &s;cene for tho&s;e diver|&s;ions.
I imagine an old Roman would be very
much &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee an Engli&s;h race on the
cour&s;e at New-Market. The Circus Maximus
was but three hundred yards in breadth. A
good part of this was taken up by the &s;pina,
or middle &s;pace, adorned with temples, &s;ta|tues,
and two great obeli&s;ks; as well as by the
euripus, or canal, made by order of Julius
Cae&s;ar, to contain crocodiles, and other aqua|tic
animals, which were killed occa&s;ionally.
This was &s;o large, that Heliogabalus, having
filled it with excellent wine, exhibited naval
engagements in it, for the amu&s;ement of the
people. It &s;urrounded three &s;ides of the
&s;quare, &s;o that the whole extent of the race
did not much exceed an Engli&s;h mile; and
when Probus was at the expence of filling the
plain of it with fir-trees to form a wood for
<PB N="132" REF="134">
the chace of wild bea&s;ts, I que&s;tion much if
this fore&s;t was more exten&s;ive than the plan|tation
in St. James's Park, on the &s;outh &s;ide
of the canal: now I leave you to judge what
ridicule a king of England would incur by
converting this part of the park into a chace
for any &s;pecies of animals which are counted
game in our country.</P>
<P>The Roman emperors &s;eemed more di&s;|po&s;ed
to elevate and &s;urprize, than to con|duct
the public diver&s;ions according to the
rules of rea&s;on and propriety. One would
imagine, it was with this view they in&s;tituted
their naumachia, or naval engagements, per|formed
by half a dozen &s;mall gallies of a
&s;ide in an artificial ba&s;in of fre&s;h water.
The&s;e gallies I &s;uppo&s;e were not &s;o large as
common fi&s;hing-&s;macks, for they were moved
by two, three, and four oars of a &s;ide, ac|cording
to their different rates, biremes, tri|remes,
and quadriremes. I know this is a
knotty point not yet determined; and that
&s;ome antiquarians believe the Roman gallies
had different tires or decks of oars; but this
is a notion very ill &s;upported, and quite con|trary
to all the figures of them that are pre|&s;erved
<PB N="133" REF="135">
on antient coins and medals. Sueto|nius
in the reign of Domitian, &s;peaking of
the&s;e naumachia, &s;ays, &startq;<HI>Edidit navales
pugnas, pene ju&s;tarum cla&s;&s;ium, effo&s;&s;o, et cir|cumducto
juxta Tyberim Lacu, atque inter maxi|mas
imbres pro&s;pectavit.</HI>&endq; This artificial lake
was not larger than the piece of water in
Hyde-Park; and yet the hi&s;torian &s;ays, it
was almo&s;t large enough for real or intire
fleets. How would it &s;ound in the ears of a
Briti&s;h &s;ailor, an adverti&s;ement that a mock
engagement between two &s;quadrons of men
of war would be exhibited on &s;uch a day in
the Serpentine river? or that the &s;hips of the
line taken from the enemy would be carried
in proce&s;&s;ion from Hyde-Park-Corner to
Tower-wharf? Certain it is, Lucullus, in one
of his triumphs, had one hundred and ten
&s;hips of war <HI>(naves longas)</HI> carried through
the &s;treets of Rome. Nothing can give a
more contemptible idea of their naval power,
than this te&s;timony of their hi&s;torians, who
declare that their &s;eamen or mariners were
formed by exerci&s;ing &s;mall row-boats in an
inclo&s;ed-pool of fre&s;h water. Had they not
the &s;ea within a few miles of them, and the
<PB N="134" REF="136">
river Tyber running through their capital!
even this would have been much more proper
for exerci&s;ing their watermen, then a pond of
&s;till-water, not much larger than a cold-bath.
I do believe in my con&s;cience that half a dozen
Engli&s;h frigates would have been able to de|feat
both the contending fleets at the famous
battle of Actium, which has been &s;o much
celebrated in the annals of antiquity, as an
event that decided the fate of empire.</P>
<P>It would employ me a whole month to de|&s;cribe
the thermae or baths, the va&s;t ruins of
which are &s;till to be &s;een within the walls of
Rome, like the remains of &s;o many &s;eparate
citadels. The thermae Diocle&s;ianae might be
termed an augu&s;t academy for the u&s;e and in|&s;truction
of the Roman people. The pinaco|theca
of this building was a complete mu|&s;aeum
of all the curio&s;ities of art and na|ture;
and there were public &s;chools for all
the &s;ciences. If I may judge by my eye,
however, the thermae Antonianae built by
Caracalla, were &s;till more exten&s;ive and mag|nificent;
they contained cells &s;ufficient for
two thou&s;and three hundred per&s;ons to bathe
at one time, without being &s;een by one ano|ther.
<PB N="135" REF="137">
They were adorned with all the charms
of painting, architecture, and &s;culpture. The
pipes for conveying the water were of &s;ilver.
Many of the lavacra were of precious mar|ble,
illuminated by lamps of chry&s;tal. A|mong
the &s;tatues, were found the famous
Toro, and Hercole Farne&s;e.</P>
<P>Bathing was certainly nece&s;&s;ary to health
and cleanline&s;s in a hot country like Italy,
e&s;pecially before the u&s;e of linen was known:
but the&s;e purpo&s;es would have been much
better an&s;wered by plunging into the Tyber,
than by u&s;ing the warm bath in the thermae,
which became altogether a point of luxury
borrowed from the effeminate A&s;iatics, and
tended to debilitate the fibres already too
much relaxed by the heat of the climate.
True it is, they had baths of cool water for
the &s;ummer: but in general they u&s;ed it milk|warm,
and often perfumed: they likewi&s;e
indulged in vapour-baths, in order to enjoy
a plea&s;ing relaxation, which they likewi&s;e
improved with odoriferous ointments. The
thermae con&s;i&s;ted of a great variety of parts
and conveniences; the natationes, or &s;wim|ming
places; the portici, where people a|mu&s;ed
<PB N="136" REF="138">
them&s;elves in walking, conver&s;ing, and
di&s;puting together, as Cicero &s;ays, <HI>In portici|bus
deambulantes di&s;putabant;</HI> the ba&s;ilicae,
where the bathers a&s;&s;embled, before they en|tered,
and after they came out of the bath;
the atria, or ample courts, adorned with noble
colonnades of Numidian marble and orien|tal
granite; the ephibia, where the young
men inured them&s;elves to wre&s;tling and o|ther
exerci&s;es; the frigidaria, or places kept
cool by a con&s;tant draught of air, promoted
by the di&s;po&s;ition and number of the win|dows;
the calidaria, where the water was
warmed for the baths; the platanones, or
delightful groves of &s;ycamore; the &s;tadia,
for the performances of the athletae; the
exedrae, or re&s;ting-places, provided with &s;eats
for tho&s;e that were weary; the pale&s;trae, where
every one cho&s;e that exerci&s;e which plea&s;ed
him be&s;t; the gymna&s;ia, where poets, ora|tors,
and philo&s;ophers recited their works,
and harangued for diver&s;ion; the eleote&s;ia,
where the fragrant oils and ointments were
kept for the u&s;e of the bathers; and the
$oni&s;teria, where the wre&s;tlers were &s;meared
with &s;and before they engaged. Of the
<PB N="137" REF="139">
thermae in Rome, &s;ome were mercenary, and
&s;ome opened gratis. Marcus Agrippa, when
he was edile, opened one hundred and &s;eventy
private baths, for the u&s;e of the people. In
the public baths, where money was taken,
each per&s;on paid a quadrans, about the value
of our halfpenny, as Juvenal ob&s;erves,
<Q>&startq;Caedere Sylvano porcum, quadrante lavari.&endq;</Q>
But after the hour of bathing was pa&s;t, it
&s;ometimes co&s;t a great deal more, according
to Martial,
<Q><L>&startq;Balnca po&s;t decimam, le&s;&s;o centumque petuntur</L>
<L>Quadrantes&mdash;&endq;</L></Q></P>
<P>Though there was no di&s;tinction in the
places, between the fir&s;t patrician and the
lowe&s;t plebeian, yet the nobility u&s;ed their
own &s;ilver and gold plate, for wa&s;hing, eating,
and drinking in the bath, together with towels
of the fine&s;t linen. They likewi&s;e made u&s;e
of the in&s;trument called &s;trigil, which was
a kind of fle&s;h-bru&s;h; a cu&s;tom to which Per|&s;ius
alludes in this line,
<Q>&startq;I puer, et &s;trigiles Cri&s;pini ad balnea de$er.&endq;</Q>
<PB N="138" REF="140">
The common people contented them&s;elves with
&s;ponges. The bathing time was from noon till
the evening, when the Romans ate their prin|cipal
meal. Notice was given by a bell, or
&s;ome &s;uch in&s;trument, when the baths were
opened, as we learn from Juvenal,
<Q><L>&startq;Redde Pilam, &s;onat AEs thermarum, ludere pergis?</L>
<L>Virgine vis &s;ola lotus abire domum.&endq;</L></Q>
There were &s;eparate places for the two &s;exes;
and indeed there were baths opened for
the u&s;e of women only, at the expence of
Agrippina, the mother of Nero, and &s;ome
other matrons of the fir&s;t quality. The u&s;e
of bathing was become &s;o habitual to the
con&s;titutions of the Romans, that Galen, in
his book <HI>De Sanilate tuenda,</HI> mentions a cer|tain
philo&s;opher, who, if he intermitted but
one day in his bathing, was certainly attacked
with a fever. In order to pre&s;erve decorum
in the baths, a &s;et of laws and regulations
were publi&s;hed, and the thermae were put
under the in&s;pection of a cen&s;or, who was
generally one of the fir&s;t &s;enators in Rome.
Agrippa left his gardens and baths, which
&s;tood near the pantheon, to the Roman peo|ple:
<PB N="139" REF="141">
among the &s;tatues that adorned them
was that of a youth naked, as going into the
bath, &s;o elegantly formed by the hand of
Ly&s;ippus, that Tiberius, being &s;truck with
the beauty of it, ordered it to be transferred
into his own palace: but the populace rai&s;ed
&s;uch a clamour again&s;t him, that he was fain
to have it reconveyed to its former place.
The&s;e noble baths were re&s;tored by Adrian,
as we read in Spartian; but at pre&s;ent no
part of them remains.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the old
aqueducts, I can give you very little &s;atisfac|tion.
I only &s;aw the ruins of that which
conveyed the aqua Claudia, near the Porta
Maggiore, and the Piazza of the Lateran.
You know there were fourteen of tho&s;e an|tient
aqueducts, &s;ome of which brought wa|ter
to Rome from the di&s;tance of forty miles.
The channels of them were large enough to
admit a man armed on hor&s;eback; and there|fore
when Rome was be&s;ieged by the Goths,
who had cut off the water, Beli&s;arius forti|fied
them with works to prevent the enemy
from entering the city by tho&s;e conveyances.
After that period, I &s;uppo&s;e the antient aque|ducts
<PB N="140" REF="142">
continued dry, and were &s;uffered to
run to ruins. Without all doubt, the Ro|mans
were greatly obliged to tho&s;e benefac|tors,
who rai&s;ed &s;uch &s;tupendous works for
the benefit, as well as the embelli&s;hment of
their city: but it might have been &s;upplied
with the &s;ame water through pipes at one
hundredth part of the expence; and in that
ca&s;e the enemy would not have found it &s;uch
an ea&s;y matter to cut it off. Tho&s;e popes who
have provided the modern city &s;o plentifully
with excellent water, are much to be com|mended
for the care and expence they have
be&s;towed in re&s;toring the &s;treams called acqua
Virgine, acqua Felici, and acqua Paolina,
which affords &s;uch abundance of water as
would plentifully &s;upply a much larger city
than modern Rome.</P>
<P>It is no wonder that M. Agrippa, the &s;on-in-law,
friend, and favourite of Augu&s;tus,
&s;hould at the &s;ame time have been the idol
of the people, con&s;idering how &s;urpri&s;ingly
he exerted him&s;elf for the emolument, con|venience,
and plea&s;ure of his fellow-citizens.
It was he who fir&s;t conducted this aqua Vir|gine
to Rome: he formed &s;even hundred re|&s;ervoirs
<PB N="141" REF="143">
in the city; erected one hundred and
five fountains; one hundred and thirty
<HI>ca&s;tella,</HI> or conduits, which works he adorned
with three hundred &s;tatues, and four hundred
pillars of marble, in the &s;pace of one year.
He al&s;o brought into Rome, the aqua Julia,
and re&s;tored the aqueduct of the aqua Mar|zia,
which had fallen to decay. I have al|ready
ob&s;erved the great number of baths
which he opened for the people, and the
magnificent thermae, with &s;pacious gardens,
which he bequeathed to them as a legacy.
But the&s;e benefactions, great and munificent
as they &s;eem to be, were not the mo&s;t im|portant
&s;ervices he performed for the city of
Rome. The common-fewers were fir&s;t made
by order of Tarquinius Pri&s;cus, not &s;o much
with a view to cleanline&s;s, as by way of &s;ub|terranean
drains to the Vilabrum, which was
mar&s;hy, and in order to carry off the &s;tag|nant
water, which remained in the lower
parts, after heavy rains. The different branches
of the&s;e channels united at the Forum, from
whence$ by the cloaca Maxima, their con|tents
were conveyed into the Tyber. This
great cloaca was the work of Tarquinius
<PB N="142" REF="144">
Superbus. Other &s;ewers were added by
Marcus Cato, and Valerius Flaccus, the cen|&s;ors.
All the&s;e drains having been choaked
up and ruinous, were cleared and re&s;tored by
Marcus Agrippa, who likewi&s;e undermined
the whole city with canals of the &s;ame kind,
for carrying off the filth; he &s;trengthened
and enlarged the cloaca maxima, &s;o as to
make it capable of receiving a large cart
loaded with hay; and directed &s;even &s;treams
of water into the&s;e &s;ubterranean pa&s;&s;ages, in
order to keep them always clean and open.
If, notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e conveniences,
Ve&s;pa&s;ian was put to great expence in re|moving
the ordure from the public &s;treets, we
have certainly a right to conclude that the
antient Romans were not more cleanly than
the modern Italians.</P>
<P>After the mau&s;olea of Augu&s;tus, and Adri|an,
which I have already mentioned, the mo&s;t
remarkable antient &s;epulchres at Rome, are
tho&s;e of Caius Ce&s;tius, and Cecilia Metella.
The fir&s;t, which &s;tands by the Porta di S.
Paolo, is a beautiful pyramid, one hundred
and twenty feet high, &s;till pre&s;erved intire,
having a vaulted chamber within-&s;ide, adorned
<PB N="143" REF="145">
with &s;ome ancient painting, which is now
almo&s;t effaced. The building is of brick, but
ca&s;ed with marble. This Caius Ce&s;tius had
been con&s;ul, was very rich, and acted as one
of the &s;even <HI>Epulones,</HI> who &s;uperintended the
fea&s;ts of the gods, called <HI>Lecti&s;ternia,</HI> and
<HI>Pervigilia.</HI> He bequeathed his whole for|tune
to his friend M. Agrippa, who was &s;o
generous as to give it up to the relations of
the te&s;tator. The monument of Cecilia Me|tella,
commonly called <HI>Capo d$ Bove,</HI> is with|out
the walls on the Via Appia. This lady
was daughter of Metellus Creticus, and wife
to Cra&s;&s;us, who erected this noble monument
to her memory. It con&s;i&s;ted of two orders,
or &s;tories, the fir&s;t of which was a &s;quare of
hewn &s;tone: the &s;econd was a circular tower&punc;
having a cornice, adorned with ox heads in
ba&s;&s;o relievo, a circum&s;tance from which it
takes the name of <HI>Capo di Bove.</HI> The ox was
&s;uppo&s;ed to be a mo&s;t grateful &s;acrifice to the
gods. Pliny, &s;peaking of bulls and oxen, &s;ays,
<Q>&startq;Hi$ victimae optimae et laudati&s;&s;ima deorum placatio.&endq;</Q>
This tower was &s;urmounted by a noble cu|pola
or dome, enriched with all the orna|ments
<PB N="144" REF="146">
of architecture. The door of the
building was of bra&s;s; and within-&s;ide the
a&s;hes of Cecilia were depo&s;ited in a fluted
marble u$$, of curious workman&s;hip, which
is &s;till kept in the Palazzo Farne&s;e. At pre|&s;ent
the &s;urface of the ground is rai&s;ed &s;o
much as to cover the fir&s;t order of the
edifice: what we &s;ee is no more than the
round tower, without the dome and its or|naments;
and the following in&s;cription &s;till
remains near the top, facing the Via Appia.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Nice, <DATE>March 30, 1765.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU mu&s;t not imagine I &s;aw one half
of the valuable pictures and &s;tatues of
Rome; there is &s;uch a va&s;t number of both
in this capital, that I might have &s;pent a
whole year in taking even a tran&s;ient view of
them; and, after all, &s;ome of them would
have been overlooked. The mo&s;t celebrated
pieces, however, I have &s;een; and therefore
my curio&s;ity is &s;atisfied. Perhaps, if I had
the nice di&s;cernment and delicate &s;en&s;ibility of
a true connoi&s;&s;eur, this &s;uperficial glimp&s;e
would have &s;erved only to whet my appetite,
and to detain me the whole winter at Rome.
<PB N="147" REF="149">
In my progre&s;s through the Vatican, I was
much plea&s;ed with the School of Athens, by
Raphael, a piece which hath &s;uffered from
the dampne&s;s of the air. The four boys at|tending
to the demon&s;tration of a mathe|matician
are admirably varied in the ex|pre&s;&s;ion.
Mr. Webb's critici&s;m on this arti&s;t
is certainly ju&s;t. He was perhaps the be&s;t
ethic painter that ever the world produced.
No man ever expre&s;&s;ed the &s;entiments &s;o hap|pily,
in vi&s;age, attitude, and ge&s;ture: but he
&s;eems to have had too much phlegm to &s;trike
off the grand pa&s;&s;ions, or reach the &s;ublime
parts of painting. He has the &s;erenity of
Virgil, but wants the fire of Homer. There
is nothing in his Parna&s;&s;us which &s;truck me,
but the ludicrous impropriety of Apollo's

of the nine mu&s;es.</P>
<P>The La&s;t Judgment, by Buonaroti, in the
chapel of Sixtus IV. produced to my eye the
&s;ame &s;ort of confu&s;ion, that perplexes my ear
at a grand concert, con&s;i&s;ting of a great va|riety
of in&s;truments: or rather, when a num|ber
of people are talking all at once. I was
plea&s;ed with the &s;trength of expre&s;&s;ion, ex|hibited
<PB N="148" REF="150">
in &s;ingle figures, and &s;eparate groupes:
but, the whole together is a mere mob, with|out
&s;ubordination, keeping, or repo&s;e. A
painter ought to avoid all &s;ubjects that re|quire
a multiplicity of groupes and figures;
becau&s;e it is not in the power of that art to
unite a great number in one point of view,
&s;o as to maintain that dependence which they
ought to have upon one another. Michael
Angelo, with all his &s;kill in anatomy, his
correctne&s;s of de&s;ign, his grand compo&s;ition,
his fire, and force of expre&s;&s;ion, &s;eems to
have had very little idea of grace. One
would imagine he had cho&s;en his kings, he|roes,
cardinals, and prelates, from among the
<HI>facchini</HI> of Rome; that he really drew his
Je&s;us on the Cro&s;s, from the agonies of &s;ome
vulgar a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in expiring on the wheel; and
that the originals of his Bambini, with their
mothers, were literally found in a &s;table. In
the Sala Regia, from whence the Si&s;tian cha|pel
is detached, we &s;ee, among other exploits
of catholic heroes, a repre&s;entation of the
ma&s;&s;acre of the prote&s;tants in Paris, Tholou&s;e,
and other parts of France, on the eve of St.
Bartholomew, thus de&s;cribed in the <HI>De&s;eri|zione

the court of Rome hath employed their
arti&s;ts to celebrate and perpetuate, as a me|ritorious
action, the mo&s;t perfidious, cruel,
and infamous ma&s;&s;acre, that ever di&s;graced
the annals of any nation.</P>
<P>I need not mention the two eque&s;trian
&s;tatues of Con&s;tantine the Great, and Char|lemagne,
which &s;tand at oppo&s;ite ends of the
great portico of St. Peter's church; becau&s;e
there is nothing in them which particularly
engaged my attention. The &s;leeping Cleopa|tra,
as you enter the court of the Belvedere,
in the Vatican, is much admired; but I was
better plea&s;ed with the Apollo, which I take
<PB N="150" REF="152">
to be the mo&s;t beautiful &s;tatue that ever was
formed. The Nile, which lies in the open
court, &s;urmounted with the little children, has
infinite merit; but is much damaged, and
altogether neglected. Whether it is the &s;ame
de&s;cribed in Pliny, as having been placed
by Ve&s;pa&s;ian in the Temple of Peace, I do
not know. The &s;ixteen children playing
about it, denoted the &s;welling of the Nile,
which never ro&s;e above &s;ixteen cubits. As
for the famous groupe of Laocoon, it &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ed
my expectation. It was not without
rea&s;on that Buonaroti called it a portentous
work; and Pliny has done it no more than
ju&s;tice in &s;aying it is the mo&s;t excellent piece that
ever was cut in marble; and yet the famous
Fulvius Ur&s;ini is of opinion that this is not
the &s;ame &s;tatue which Pliny de&s;cribed. His
rea&s;ons, mentioned by Montfaucon, are the&s;e.
The &s;tatues de&s;cribed by Pliny were of one
&s;tone; but the&s;e are not. Antonioli, the an|tiquary,
has in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, pieces of Lao|coon's
&s;nakes, which were found in the
ground, where the baths of Titus actually
&s;tood, agreeable to Pliny, who &s;ays the&s;e &s;ta|tues
were placed in the buildings of Titus.
<PB N="151" REF="153">
Be that as it may, the work which we now
&s;ee does honour to antiquity. As you have
&s;een innumerable copies and ca&s;ts of it, in
marble, plai&s;ter, copper, lead, drawings, and
prints, and read the de&s;cription of it in
Key&s;lar, and twenty other books of travels,
I &s;hall &s;ay nothing more on the &s;ubject; but
that neither they nor I, nor any other per&s;on,
could &s;ay too much in its prai&s;e. It is not
of one piece indeed. In that particular Pliny
him&s;elf might be mi&s;taken. &startq;<HI>Opus omnibus

Ex uno lapide eum et Liberos draconumque mir$|biles

Buonaroti di&s;covered the joinings,
though they were &s;o artfully concealed as to
be invi&s;ible. This amazing groupe is the
work of three Rhodian &s;culptors, called
Age&s;ander, Polydore, and Athenodorus, and
was found in the thermae of Titus Ve&s;|pa&s;ian,
&s;till &s;uppo&s;ing it to be the true an|tique.
As for the <HI>tor&s;o,</HI> or mutilated trunk
of a &s;tatue, which is called the School of
Michael Angelo, I had not time to con&s;ider
it attentively; nor ta&s;te enough to perceive
its beauties at fir&s;t &s;ight. The famous hor&s;es
<PB N="152" REF="154">
on Monte Cavallo, before the pope's palace,
which are &s;aid to have been made in emula|tion,
by Phidias and Praxiteles, I have &s;een,
and likewi&s;e tho&s;e in the front of the Capitol,
with the &s;tatues of Ca&s;tor and Pollux; but
what plea&s;ed me infinitely more than all of
them together, is the eque&s;trian &s;tatue of Co|rinthian
bra&s;s, &s;tanding in the middle of this
Piazza (I mean at the Capitol) &s;aid to repre|&s;ent
the emperor Marcus Aurelius. Others
&s;uppo&s;e it was intended for Lucius Verus; a
third &s;et of antiquaries contend for Lucius
Septimius Severus; and a fourth, for Con|&s;tantine,
becau&s;e it &s;tood in the Piazza of the
Lateran palace, built by that emperor, from
whence pope Paul III. cau&s;ed it to be re|moved
to the Capitol. I con&s;idered the tro|phy
of Marius as a very curious piece of
&s;culpture, and admired the two &s;phinges at
the bottom of the &s;tairs leading to this Piazza,
as the only good repre&s;entations of life I had
ever &s;een from AEgypt: for the two idols of
that country, which &s;tand in the ground|floor
of the Mu&s;aeum of the Capitol, and in|deed
all the AEgyptian &s;tatues in the Camera
AEgyptiaca of this very building, are &s;uch
<PB N="153" REF="155">
mon&s;trous mi&s;repre&s;entations of nature, that
they never could have obtained a place among
the &s;tatues of Rome, except as curio&s;ities of
foreign &s;uper&s;tition, or on account of the ma|terials,
as they are generally of ba&s;altes, por|phyry,
or oriental granite.</P>
<P>At the farther end of the court of this
Mu&s;aeum, fronting the entrance, is a hand|&s;ome
fountain, with the &s;tatue of a river-god
reclining on his urn; this is no other than
the famous Marforio, &s;o called from its
having been found in Martis Foro. It is
remarkable only as being the conveyance of
the an&s;wers to the &s;atires which are found
pa&s;ted upon Pa&s;quin, another mutilated &s;ta|tue,
&s;tanding at the corner of a &s;treet.</P>
<P>The marble coffin, &s;uppo&s;ed to have con|tained
the a&s;hes of Alexander Severus, which
we find in one of the&s;e apartments, is a cu|rious
antique, valuable for its &s;culpture in
ba&s;&s;o relievo, e&s;pecially for the figures on the
cover, repre&s;enting that emperor and his mo|ther
Julia Mammea.</P>
<P>I was &s;orry I had not time to con&s;ider the
antient plan of Rome, di&s;po&s;ed in &s;ix cla&s;&s;es,
on the &s;tair-ca&s;e of this Mu&s;aeum, which was
<PB N="154" REF="156">
brought hither from a temple that &s;tood in
the Forum Boarium, now called Campo
Vaccino.</P>
<P>It would be ridiculous in me to enter into
a detail of the va&s;t collection of marbles,
ba&s;&s;o relievos, in&s;criptions, urns, bu&s;ts, and
&s;tatues, which are placed in the upper apart|ments
of this edifice. I &s;aw them but once,
and then I was &s;truck with the following
particulars. A bacchanalian drunk; a Jupiter
and Leda, at lea&s;t equal to that in the gal|lery
at Florence; an old <HI>praefica,</HI> or hired
mourner, very much re&s;embling tho&s;e wrink|led
hags &s;till employed in Ireland, and in
the Highlands of Scotland, to &s;ing the <HI>coro|nach</HI>
at funerals, in prai&s;e of the decea&s;ed;
the famous Antinous, an elegant figure,
which Pou&s;in &s;tudied as the canon or rule of
&s;ymmetry; the two fauns; and above all the
<HI>mirmillone,</HI> or dying gladiator; the attitude
of the body, the expre&s;&s;ion of the counte|nance,
the elegance of the limbs, and the
&s;welling of the mu&s;cles, in this &s;tatue, are
univer&s;ally admired; but the execution of
the back is incredibly delicate. The cour&s;e
of the mu&s;cles called <HI>longi&s;&s;imi dor&s;i,</HI> are &s;o
<PB N="155" REF="157">
naturally marked and tenderly executed, that
the marble actually emulates the &s;oftne&s;s of
fle&s;h; and you may count all the &s;pines of the
vertebrae, rai&s;ing up the &s;kin as in the living
body; yet this &s;tatue, with all its merit, &s;eems
inferior to the celebrated dying gladiator of
Cte&s;ilas, as de&s;cribed by Pliny, who &s;ays the ex|pre&s;&s;ion
of it was &s;uch, as appears altogether in|credible.
In the court, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the
Capitol, there is an admirable &s;tatue of a lion
devouring an hor&s;e, which was found by the
gate of O&s;tia, near the pyramid of Caius
Ce&s;tius; and here on the left hand, under a
colonade, is what they call the Columna
Ro&s;trata, erected in honour of Caius Duilius,
who fir&s;t triumphed over the Carthaginians
by &s;ea. But this is a modern pillar, with
the old in&s;cription, which is &s;o defaced as not
to be legible. Among the pictures in the
gallery and &s;aloon above, what plea&s;ed me
mo&s;t was the Bacchus and Ariadne of Guido
Rheni; and the wolf &s;uckling Romulus and
Remus, by Rubens. The court of the Pa|lazzo
Farne&s;e is &s;urrounded with antique
&s;tatues, among which the mo&s;t celebrated
are, the Flora, with a mo&s;t delicate drapery;
<PB N="156" REF="158">
the gladiator, with a dead boy over his
&s;houlder; the Hercules, with the &s;poils of
the Nemean lion; but that which the con|noi&s;&s;eurs
ju&s;tly e&s;teem above all the re&s;t is
the Hercules, by Glycon, which you know as
well as I do, by the great reputation it has
acquired. This admirable &s;tatue having been
found without the legs, the&s;e were &s;upplied
by Gulielmo de la Porta &s;o happily, that
when afterwards the original limbs were di&s;|covered,
Michael Angelo preferred the mo|dern
ones, both in grace and proportion; and
they have been retained accordingly. In a
little hou&s;e, or &s;hed, behind the court, is
pre&s;erved the wonderful groupe of Dirce,
commonly called the Toro Farne&s;e, which
was brought hither from the thermae Cara|callae.
There is &s;uch &s;pirit, ferocity, and
indignant re&s;i&s;tance expre&s;&s;ed in the bull, to
who&s;e horns Dirce is tied by the hair, that I
have never &s;een any thing like it, either upon
canva&s;s, or in &s;tone. The &s;tatues of the two
brothers endeavouring to throw him into the
&s;ea are beautiful figures, finely contra&s;ted;
and the rope, which one of them holds in a
&s;ort of loo&s;e coil, is &s;o &s;urpri&s;ingly chizzelled,
<PB N="157" REF="159">
that one can hardly believe it is of &s;tone.
As for Dirce her&s;elf, &s;he &s;eems to be but a
&s;ubaltern character; but there is a dog upon
his hind legs barking at the bull, which is
much admired. This amazing groupe was
cut out of one &s;tone, by Appollonius and
Tauri&s;cus, two &s;culptors of Rhodes; and is
mentioned by Pliny in the thirty-&s;ixth book
of his Natural Hi&s;tory. All the precious
monuments of art, which have come down to
us from antiquity, are the productions of
Greek arti&s;ts. The Romans had ta&s;te enough
to admire the arts of Greece, as plainly ap|pears
by the great collections they made of
their &s;tatues and pictures, as well as by
adopting their achitecture and mu&s;ick: but
I do not remember to have read of any Ro|man
who made a great figure either as a
painter or a &s;tatuary. It is not enough to
&s;ay tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ions were not honourable in
Rome, becau&s;e painting, &s;culpture, and mu|&s;ick,
even rhetoric, phy&s;ic, and philo&s;ophy,
were practi&s;ed and taught by &s;laves. The arts
were always honoured and revered at Rome,
even when the profe&s;&s;ors of them happened
to be &s;laves by the accidents and iniquity of
<PB N="158" REF="160">
fortune. The bu&s;ine&s;s of painting and &s;ta|tuary
was &s;o profitable, that in a free re|public,
like that of Rome, they mu&s;t have
been greedily embraced by a great number
of individuals: but, in all probability, the
Roman &s;oil produced no extraordinary ge|nius
for tho&s;e arts. Like the Engli&s;h of this
day, they made a figure in poetry, hi&s;tory,
and ethics; but the excellence of painting,
&s;culpture, architecture, and mu&s;ic, they never
could attain. In the Palazzo Picchini, I &s;aw
three beautiful figures, the celebrated &s;tatues
of Meleager, the boar, and dog; together
with a wolf, of excellent workman&s;hip. The
celebrated &s;tatue of Mo&s;es, by Michael Angelo,
in the church of St. Peter in Vincula, I be|held
with plea&s;ure; as well as that of Chri&s;t,
by the &s;ame hand, in the church of S. Ma|ria
&s;opra Minerva. The right foot, covered
with bronze, gilt, is much ki&s;&s;ed by the de|votees.
I &s;uppo&s;e it is looked upon as a
&s;pecific for the tooth-ache; for, I &s;aw a cava|lier,
in years, and an old woman &s;ucce&s;&s;ively
rub their gums upon it, with the appearance
of the mo&s;t painful per&s;everance.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="161">
You need not doubt but that I went to
the church of St. Peter in Montorio, to view
the celebrated transfiguration, by Raphael,
which, if it was mine, I would cut in two
parts. The three figures in the air attract
the eye &s;o &s;trongly, that little or no attention
is payed to tho&s;e below on the mountain.
I apprehend that the nature of the &s;ubject
does not admit of that keeping and de|pendence,
which ought to be maintained in
the di&s;po&s;ition of the lights and &s;hadows in
a picture. The groupes &s;eem to be intirely
independent of each other. The extraordi|nary
merit of this piece, I imagine, con&s;i&s;ts,
not only in the expre&s;&s;ion of divinity on the
face of Chri&s;t; but al&s;o in the &s;urpri&s;ing
lightne&s;s of the figure, that hovers like a
beautiful exhalation in the air. In the
church of St. Luke, I was not at all &s;truck by
the picture of that &s;aint, drawing the portrait
of the Virgin Mary, although it is admired as
one of the be&s;t pieces of Raphael. Indeed it
made &s;o little impre&s;&s;ion upon me, that I do
not even remember the di&s;po&s;ition of the
figures. The altar-piece, by Andrea Sacchi,
in the church of St Romauldus, would have
<PB N="160" REF="162">
more merit, if the figure of the &s;aint him&s;elf
had more con&s;equence, and was repre&s;ented
in a &s;tronger light. In the Palazzo Borghe&s;e,
I chiefly admired the following pieces: a
Venus with two nymphs; and another with
Cupid, both by Titian: an excellent Roman
Piety, by Leonardo da Vinci; and the cele|brated
Mu&s;e, by Dominechino, which is a fine,
jolly, buxom figure. At the palace of Co|lonna
Conne&s;tabile, I was charmed with the
Herodias, by Guido Rheni; a young Chri&s;t;
and a Madonna, by Raphael; and four land-&s;chapes,
two by Claude Lorraine, and the
other two, by Salvator Ro&s;a. In the <HI>palazetto,</HI>
or &s;ummer-hou&s;e belonging to the Palazzo
Ro&s;piglio&s;i, I had the &s;atisfaction of contem|plating
the Aurora of Guido, the colours of
which &s;till remain in high perfection, not|with&s;tanding
the common report that the
piece is &s;poiled by the dampne&s;s of the apart|ment.
The print of this picture, by Freij,
with all its merit, conveys but an imperfect
idea of the beauty of the original. In the Pa|lazzo
Barberini, there is a great collection of
marbles and pictures: among the fir&s;t, I wa$
attracted by a beautiful &s;tatue of Venus;$
<PB N="161" REF="163">
&s;leeping faun, of curious workman&s;hip; a
charming Bacchus, lying on an antient &s;culp|ture,
and the famous Narci&s;&s;us. Of the
pictures, what gave me mo&s;t plea&s;ure was
the Magdalen of Guido, infinitely &s;uperior
to that by Le Brun in the church of the
Carmelites at Paris; the Virgin, by Titian;
a Madonna, by Raphael, but not comparable
to that which is in the Palazzo de Pitti, at
Florence; and the death of Germanicus, by
Pou&s;&s;in, which I take to be one of the be&s;t
pieces in this great collection. In the Palazzo
Falconeri, there is a beautiful St. Cecilia, by
Guercino; a holy family, by Raphael; and
a fine expre&s;&s;ive figure of St. Peter weeping,
by Dominechino. In the Palazzo Altieri, I
admired a picture, by Carlo Maratti, repre|&s;enting
a &s;aint calling down lightning from
heaven to de&s;troy bla&s;phemers. It was the
figure of the &s;aint I admired, merely as a
portrait. The execution of the other parts
was tame enough: perhaps they were pur|po&s;ely
kept down, in order to pre&s;erve the
importance of the principal figure. I ima|gine
Salvator Ro&s;a would have made a dif|ferent
di&s;po&s;ition on the &s;ame &s;ubject: that
<PB N="162" REF="164">
amid&s;t the darkne&s;s of a tempe&s;t, he would
have illuminated the bla&s;phemer with the
fla&s;h of lightning by which he was de&s;troyed:
this would have thrown a di&s;mal gleam upon
his countenance, di&s;torted by the horror of
his &s;ituation as well as by the effects of the
fire; and rendered the whole &s;cene dread|fully
picture&s;que. In the &s;ame palace, I &s;aw
the famous holy family, by Corregio, which
he left unfini&s;hed, and no other arti&s;t would
undertake to &s;upply; for what rea&s;on I know
not. Here too is a judgment of Paris, by
Titian, which is reckoned a very valuable
piece. In the Palazzo Ode&s;calchi, there is a
holy family, by Buonaroti, and another by
Raphael, both counted excellent, though in
very different &s;tiles, extremely characteri&s;tic
of tho&s;e two great rival arti&s;ts.</P>
<P>If I was &s;illy enough to make a parade, I
might mention &s;ome hundreds more of mar|bles
and pictures, which I really &s;aw at
Rome; and even eke out that number with
a huge li&s;t of tho&s;e I did not &s;ee: but, what|ever
vanity I may have, it has not taken this
turn; and I a&s;&s;ure you, upon my word and
honour, I have de&s;cribed nothing but what
<PB N="163" REF="165">
actually fell under my own ob&s;ervation. As
for my critical remarks, I am afraid you will
think them too &s;uperficial and capricious to
belong to any other per&s;on but</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have nothing to communicate touching
the library of the Vatican, which, with
re&s;pect to the apartments and their ornaments,
is undoubtedly magnificent. The number of
books it contains does not exceed forty thou|&s;and
volumes, which are all concealed from
the view, and locked up in pre&s;&s;es: as for
the manu&s;cripts, I &s;aw none but &s;uch as are
commonly pre&s;ented to &s;trangers of our na|tion;
&s;ome very old copies of Virgil and
Terence; two or three Mi&s;&s;als, curiou&s;ly illu|minated;
<PB N="164" REF="166">
the book DeSeptem Sacramentis
written in Latin by Henry VIII. again&s;t
Luther; and &s;ome of that prince's love let|ters
to Anne Boleyn. I likewi&s;e vi&s;ited the
Libreria Ca&s;anaten&s;e, belonging to the convent
of the church called S. Maria Sopra Minerva.
I had a recommendation to the principal li|brarian,
a Dominican friar, who received me
very politely, and regaled me with a &s;ight of
&s;everal curious MSS. of the cla&s;&s;ics.</P>
<P>Having &s;atisfied my curio&s;ity at Rome, I
prepared for my departure, and as the road
between Radicofani and Montefia&s;cone is
very &s;tony and di&s;agreeable, I a&s;ked the banker
Barazzi, if there was not a better way of re|turning
to Florence, expre&s;&s;ing a de&s;ire at the
&s;ame time to &s;ee the ca&s;cade of Terni. He
a&s;&s;ured me that the road by Terni was forty
miles &s;horter than the other, much more &s;afe
and ea&s;y, and accommodated with exceeding
good auberges. Had I taken the trouble to
ca&s;t my eyes upon the map, I mu&s;t have &s;een,
that the road by Terni, in&s;tead of being forty
miles &s;horter, was much longer than the
other: but this was not the only mi&s;take
of Signiore Barazzi. Great part of this way
<PB N="165" REF="167">
lies over &s;teep mountains, or along the &s;ide
of precipices, which render travelling in a
carriage exceeding tedious, dreadful, and dan|gerous;
and as for the public hou&s;es, they
are in all re&s;pects the mo&s;t execrable that
ever I entered. I will venture to &s;ay that a
common pri&s;oner in the Mar&s;hal&s;ea or King's|Bench
is more cleanly and commodiou&s;ly
lodged than we were in many places on this
road. The hou&s;es are abominably na&s;ty, and
generally de&s;titute of provi&s;ion: when eata|bles
were found, we were almo&s;t poi&s;oned by
their cookery: their beds were without cur|tains
or bed&s;tead, and their windows without
gla&s;s; and for this &s;ort of entertainment we
payed as much as if we had been genteelly
lodged, and &s;umptuou&s;ly treated. I repeat it
again; of all the people I ever knew, the
Italians are the mo&s;t villainou&s;ly rapacious.
The fir&s;t day, having pa&s;&s;ed Civita Ca&s;tellana,
a &s;mall town &s;tanding on the top of a hill,
we put up at what was called an excellent
inn, where cardinals, prelates, and princes,
often lodged. Being meagre day, there was
nothing but bread, eggs, and anchovies, in
the hou&s;e. I went to bed without &s;upper,
<PB N="166" REF="168">
and lay in a pallet, where I was half devoured
by vermin. Next day, our road, in &s;ome
places, lay along precipices, which over-hang
the Nera or Nar, celebrated in antiquity for
its white foam, and the &s;ulphureous quality
of its waters.
<Q>Sulfure&acirc; nar albus aqu&atilde;, fonte&s;que velini.</Q>
It is a &s;mall, but rapid &s;tream, which runs
not far from hence, into the Tyber. Pa&s;&s;ing
Utricoli, near the ruins of the ancient Ocri|coli,
and the romantic town of Narni, &s;i|tuated
on the top of a mountain, in the
neighbourhood of which is &s;till &s;een &s;tanding
one arch of the &s;tupendous bridge built by
Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar, we arrived at Terni, and
hiring a couple of chai&s;es before dinner, went
to &s;ee the famous Ca&s;cata delle Marmore,
which is at the di&s;tance of three miles. We
a&s;cended a &s;teep mountain by a narrow road
formed for a con&s;iderable way along the
brink of a precipice, at the bottom of which
brawls the furious river Nera, after having
received the Velino. This la&s;t is the &s;tream
which, running from the Lago delle Marmore,
forms the ca&s;cade by falling over a precipice
<PB N="167" REF="169">
about one hundred and &s;ixty feet high. Such
a body of water ru&s;hing down the moun|tain;
the &s;moak, vapour, and thick white
mi&s;t which it rai&s;es; the double rainbow
which the&s;e particles continually exhibit while
the &s;un &s;hines; the deafening &s;ound of the
cataract; the vicinity of a great number of
other &s;tupendous rocks and precipices, with
the da&s;hing, boiling, and foaming of the two
rivers below, produce altogether an object of
tremendous &s;ublimity: yet great part of its
effect is lo&s;t, for want of a proper point of
view, from which it might be contemplated.
The ca&s;cade would appear much more a&s;to|ni&s;hing,
were it not in &s;ome mea&s;ure eclip&s;ed
by the &s;uperior height of the neighbouring
mountains. You have not a front per&s;pec|tive;
but are obliged to view it obliquely on
one &s;ide, &s;tanding upon the brink of a preci|pice,
which cannot be approached without
horror. This &s;tation might be rendered
much more acce&s;&s;ible, and altogether &s;ecure,
for the expence of four or five zequines;
and a &s;mall tax might be levied for the pur|po&s;e
from travellers by the aubergi&s;te at Terni,
who lets his cala&s;&s;es for half a zequine a
<PB N="168" REF="170">
piece to tho&s;e that are curious to &s;ee this
phaenomenon. Be&s;ides the two po&s;tilions
whom I payed for this excur&s;ion, at the rate
of one &s;tage in po&s;ting, there was a fellow
who po&s;ted him&s;elf behind one of the chai&s;es,
by way of going to point out the different
views of the ca&s;cade; and his demand a|mounted
to four or five pauls. To give you
an idea of the extortion of tho&s;e villainous
publicans, I mu&s;t tell you that for a dinner
and &s;upper, which even hunger could not
tempt us to eat, and a night's lodging in
three truckle beds, I paid eighty pauls, a|mounting
to forty &s;hillings &s;terling. You
a&s;k me why I &s;ubmitted to &s;uch impo&s;ition?
I will tell you&mdash;I have more than once in
my travels made a formal complaint of the
exorbitancy of a publican, to the magi&s;trate
of the place; but I never received any &s;a|tisfaction,
and have lo&s;t abundance of time.
Had I proceeded to manual correction, I
&s;hould have alarmed and terrified the wo|men&punc;
had I peremptorily refu&s;ed to pay the
&s;um total, the landlord, who was the po&s;t|ma&s;ter,
would not have &s;upplied me with
hor&s;es to proceed on my journey. I tried the
<PB N="169" REF="171">
experiment at Muy in France, where I put
my&s;elf into a violent pa&s;&s;ion, had abundance
of trouble, was detained till it was almo&s;t
night, and after all found my&s;elf obliged to
&s;ubmit, furni&s;hing at the &s;ame time matter
of infinite triumph to the mob, which had
&s;urrounded the coach, and intere&s;ted them|&s;elves
warmly in favour of their town&s;man.
If &s;ome young patriot, in good health and
&s;pirits, would take the trouble as often as he
is impo&s;ed upon by the road in travelling, to
have recour&s;e to the fountain-head, and pre|fer
a regular complaint to the comptroller of
the po&s;ts, either in France or Italy, he would
have ample &s;atisfaction, and do great &s;ervice
to the community. Terni is an agreeable
town, pretty well built, and &s;ituated in a
plea&s;ant valley, between two branches of the
river Nera, whence it was called by the an|tients,
Interamna. Here is an agreeable
piazza, where &s;tands a church that was of
old a heathen temple. There are &s;ome va|luable
paintings in the church. The people
are &s;aid to be very civil, and provi&s;ions to
be extremely cheap. It was the birth-place
of the emperor Tacitus, as well as of the
<PB N="170" REF="172">
hi&s;torian of the &s;ame name. In our
journey from hence to Spoleto, we pa&s;&s;ed
over a high mountain, (I think it is called
Somna,) where it was nece&s;&s;ary to have
two additional hor&s;es to the carriage, and
the road winds along a precipice, which
is equally dangerous and dreadful. We
pa&s;&s;ed through part of Spoleto, the capital
of Umbria, which is a pretty large city. Of
this, however, I can give no other account
from my own ob&s;ervation, but that I &s;aw at
a di&s;tance the famous Gothic aqueduct or
brick: this is mentioned by Addi&s;on as a
&s;tructure, which, for the height of its arches,
is not equalled by any thing in Europe. The
road from hence to Foligno, where we lay,
is kept in good order, and lies through a
delightful plain, laid out into beautiful inclo|&s;ures,
abounding with wine, oil, corn, and
cattle, and watered by the pa&s;toral &s;treams
of the famous river Clitumnus, which takes
its ri&s;e in three or four &s;eparate rivulets i&s;&s;u|ing
from a rock near the highway. On the
right-hand, we &s;aw &s;everal towns &s;ituated on
ri&s;ing grounds, and among the re&s;t, that
of A&s;&s;i&s;io, famous for the birth of St$
<PB N="171" REF="173">
Francis, who&s;e body, being here depo&s;ited,
occa&s;ions a great concour&s;e of pilgrims.
We met a Roman prince&s;s going thither
with a grand retinue, in con&s;equence of
a vow &s;he had made for the re-e&s;tabli&s;h|ment
of her health. Foligno, the Ful|ginium
of the antients, is a &s;mall town,
not unplea&s;ant, lying in the mid&s;t of mul|berry
plantations, vineyards, and corn-fields,
and built on both &s;ides of the little river
Topino. In choo&s;ing our beds at the inn,
I perceived one chamber locked, and de&s;ired it
might be opened; upon which the cameriere
declared with &s;ome reluctance, <HI>&startq;Be&s;ogna
dire a &s;u' eccellenza; poco fa, che una be&s;tia e
morta in que&s;ta camera, e non e ancora lu&s;trata.&endq;</HI>
When I enquired what bea&s;t it was, he re|plied,
<HI>&startq;Un' eretico Ingle&s;e.&endq;</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e he
would not have made &s;o free with our coun|try
and religion, if he had not taken us for
German catholics, as we afterwards learned
from Mr. R&mdash;i. Next day, we cro&s;&s;ed the
Tyber, over a hand&s;ome bridge, and in
mounting the &s;teep hill upon which the city
of Perugia &s;tands, our hor&s;es being exhau&s;ted,
were dragged backwards by the weight of the
<PB N="172" REF="174">
carriage to the very edge of a precipice, where,
happily for us, a man pa&s;&s;ing that way, placed
a large &s;tone behind one of the wheels, which
&s;topped their motion, otherwi&s;e we &s;hould
have been all da&s;hed in pieces. We had
another ugly hill to a&s;cend within the city,
which was more difficult and dangerous than
the other: but the po&s;tillions and the other
bea&s;ts made &s;uch efforts, that we mounted
without the lea&s;t &s;top, to the &s;ummit, where
we found our&s;elves in a large piazza, where
the hor&s;es are always changed. There being
no relays at the po&s;t, we were obliged to &s;tay
the whole day and night at Perugia, which
is a con&s;iderable city, built upon the acclivity
of a hill, adorned with &s;ome elegant foun|tains,
and &s;everal hand&s;ome churches, con|taining
&s;ome valuable pictures by Guido,
Raphael, and his ma&s;ter Pietro Perugino,
who was a native of this place. The next
&s;tage is on the banks of the lake, which was
the Thra&s;imene of the antients, a beautiful
piece of water, above thirty miles in circum|$erence,
having three i&s;lands, abounding with
excellent fi&s;h: upon a penin&s;ula of it, there
is a town and ca&s;tle. It was in this neigh|bourhood
<PB N="173" REF="175">
where the con$ul Flaminius was
totally defeated with great &s;laughter by Hanni|bal.
From Perugia to Florence, the po&s;ts
are all double, and the road is &s;o bad that
we never could travel above eight and twenty
miles a day. We were often obliged to quit
the carriage, and walk up &s;teep mountains;
and the way in general was &s;o unequal and
&s;tony, that we were jolted even to the dan|ger
of our lives. I never felt any &s;ort of
exerci&s;e or fatigue &s;o intolerable; and I did
not fail to be&s;tow an hundred benedictions
per diem upon the banker Barazzi, by who&s;e
advice we had taken this road; yet there was
no remedy but patience. If the coach had
not been incredibly &s;trong, it mu&s;t have been
&s;hattered to pieces. The fifth night we
pa&s;&s;ed at a place called Camoccia, a mi&s;erable
cabaret, where we were fain to cook our own
&s;upper, and lay in a mu&s;ty chamber, which
had never known a fire, and indeed had no
fire-place, and where we ran the ri&s;que of
being devoured by rats. Next day one of
the irons of the coach gave way at Arezzo,
where we were detained two hours before it
could be accommodated. I might have taken
<PB N="174" REF="176">
this opportunity to view the remains of the
antient Etru&s;can amphitheatre, and the tem|ple
of Hercules, de&s;cribed by the cavalier
Lorenzo Guazze&s;i, as &s;tanding in the neigh|bourhood
of this place: but the black&s;mith
a&s;&s;ured me his work would be fini&s;hed in a
few minutes; and as I had nothing &s;o much
at heart as the &s;peedy accompli&s;hment of this
di&s;agreeable journey, I cho&s;e to &s;uppre&s;s my
curio&s;ity, rather than be the occa&s;ion of a
moment's delay. But all the nights we had
hitherto pa&s;&s;ed were comfortable in compari|&s;on
to this, which we &s;uffered at a &s;mall
village, the name of which I do not remem|ber.
The hou&s;e was di&s;mal and dirty be|yond
all de&s;cription; the bed-cloaths filthy
enough to turn the &s;tomach of a muleteer;
and the victuals cooked in &s;uch a manner,
that even a Hottentot could not have beheld
them without loathing. We had &s;heets of
our own, which were &s;pread upon a mattra&s;s,
and here I took my repo&s;e wrapped in a great-coat,
if that could be called repo&s;e which
was interrupted by the innumerable &s;tings of
vermin. In the morning, I was &s;eized with
a dangerous fit of the hooping-cough, which
<PB N="175" REF="177">
terrified my wife, alarmed my people, and
brought the whole community into the hou&s;e.
I had undergone ju&s;t &s;uch another at Paris,
about a year before. This forenoon, one of
our coach wheels flew off in the neighbour|hood
of Anci&s;a, a &s;mall town, where we were
detained above two hours by this accident;
a delay which was productive of much di&s;|appointment,
danger, vexation, and fatigue.
There being no hor&s;es at the la&s;t po&s;t, we were
obliged to wait until tho&s;e which brought us
thither &s;hould be &s;ufficiently refre&s;hed to pro|ceed.
Under&s;tanding that all the gates of
Florence are &s;hut at &s;ix, except two that
are kept open for the accommodation of
travellers; and that to reach the neare&s;t of
the&s;e gates, it was nece&s;&s;ary to pa&s;s the river
Arno in a ferry-boat, which could not tran&s;|port
the carriage; I determined to &s;end my
&s;ervant before with a light chai&s;e to enter the
neare&s;t gate before it was &s;hut, and provide
a coach to come and take us up at the &s;ide of
the river, where we &s;hould be obliged to pa&s;s
in the boat: for I could not bear the thoughts
of lying another night in a common cabaret.
Here, however, another difficulty occurred.
<PB N="176" REF="178">
There was but one chai&s;e, and a dragoon
officer, in the imperial troops, in&s;i&s;ted upon
his having be&s;poke it for him&s;elf and his
&s;ervant. A long di&s;pute en&s;ued, which had
like to have produced a quarrel: but at
length I accommodated matters, by telling
the officer that he &s;hould have a place in it
gratis, and his &s;ervant might ride a-hor&s;e-back.
He accepted the offer without he&s;ita|tion;
but, in the mean time, we &s;et out in
the coach before them, and having proceeded
about a couple of miles, the road was &s;o
deep from a heavy rain, and the bea&s;ts were
&s;o fatigued, that they could not proceed.
The po&s;tillions &s;courging the poor animals
with great barbarity, they made an effort, and
pulled the coach to the brink of a precipice,
or rather a kind of hollow-way, which might
be about &s;even or eight feet lower than the
road. Here my wife and I leaped out, and
&s;tood under the rain up to the ancles in mud;
while the po&s;tillions &s;till exerci&s;ing their whips,
one of the fore-hor&s;es fairly tumbled down
the de&s;cent, and hung by the neck, &s;o that
he was almo&s;t &s;trangled before he could be
di&s;engaged from the traces, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
<PB N="177" REF="179">
of &s;ome foot travellers that happened to pa&s;s.
While we remained in this dilemma, the
chai&s;e, with the officer and my &s;ervant, com|ing
up, we exchanged places; my wife and
I proceeded in the chai&s;e, and left them with
Mi&s;s C&mdash;and Mr. R&mdash;, to follow in
the coach. The road from hence to Florence
is nothing but a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;teep moun|tains,
paved and conducted in &s;uch a man|ner,
that one would imagine the de&s;ign had
been to render it impracticable by any &s;ort
of wheel-carriage. Notwith&s;tanding all our
endeavours, I found it would be impo&s;&s;ible to
enter Florence before the gates were &s;hut. I
flattered and threatened the driver by turns:
but the fellow, who had been remarkably
civil at fir&s;t, grew &s;ullen and impertinent.
He told me I mu&s;t not think of reaching
Florence: that the boat would not take the
carriage on board; and that from the other
&s;ide, I mu&s;t walk five miles before I &s;hould
reach the gate that was open: but he would
carry me to an excellent o&s;teria, where I
&s;hould be entertained and lodged like a prince.
I was now convinced that he had lingered on
purpo&s;e to &s;erve this inn-keeper; and I took
<PB N="178" REF="180">
it for granted that what he told me of the
di&s;tance between the ferry and the gate was
a lie. It was eight o'clock when we arrived
at his inn. I a&s;ighted with my wife to view
the chambers, de&s;iring he would not put up
his hor&s;es. Finding it was a villainous hou&s;e,
we came forth, and, by this time, the hor&s;es
were put up. I a&s;ked the fellow how he
dur&s;t pre&s;ume to contradict my orders, and
commanded him to put them to the chai&s;e.
He a&s;ked in his turn if I was mad? If I
thought I and the lady had &s;trength and courage
enough to walk five miles in the dark, through
a road which we did not know, and which was
broke up by a continued rain of two days?
I told him he was an impertinent ra&s;cal, and
as he &s;till he&s;itated, I collared him with one
hand, and &s;hook my cane over his head with
the other. It was the only weapon I had,
either offen&s;ive or defen&s;ive; for I had left
my &s;word, and mu&s;quetoon in the coach.
At length the fellow obeyed, though with
great reluctance, cracking many &s;evere jokes
upon us in the mean time, and being joined
in his raillery by the inn-keeper, who had
all the external marks of a ruffian. The
<PB N="179" REF="181">
hou&s;e &s;tood in a &s;olitary &s;ituation, and not a
&s;oul appeared but the&s;e two mi&s;creants, &s;o
that they might have murdered us without
fear of detection. &startq;You do not like the
apartments? (&s;aid one) to be &s;ure they were
not fitted up for per&s;ons of your rank and
quality!&endq; &startq;You will be glad of a wor&s;e
chamber, (continued the other) before you
get to bed.&endq; &startq;If you walk to Florence to
night, you will &s;leep &s;o &s;ound, that the fleas
will not di&s;turb you.&endq; &startq;Take care you do
not take up your night's lodging in the middle
of the road, or in the ditch of the city-wall.&endq;
I fired inwardly at the&s;e &s;arca&s;ms, to which,
however, I made no reply; and my wife was
almo&s;t dead with fear. In the road from
hence to the boat, we met with an ill-look|ing
fellow, who offered his &s;ervice to conduct
us into the city, and &s;uch was our &s;ituation,
that I was fain to accept his propo&s;al, e&s;peci|ally
as we had two &s;mall boxes in the chai&s;e
by accident, containing &s;ome caps and laces
belonging to my wife. I &s;till hoped the po|&s;tilion
had exaggerated in the di&s;tance be|tween
the boat and the city gate, and was
confirmed in this opinion by the ferryman,
<PB N="180" REF="182">
who &s;aid we had not above half a league to
walk. Behold us then in this expedition;
my&s;elf wrapped up in a very heavy great-coat,
and my cane in my hand. I did not
imagine I could have walked a couple of miles
in this equipage, had my life been depending;
my wife a delicate creature, who had &s;carce
ever walked a mile in her life; and the raga|muffin
before us with our boxes under his
arm. The night was dark and wet; the
road &s;lippery and dirty; not a &s;oul was &s;$en,
nor a &s;ound was heard: all was &s;ilent, dreary,
and horrible. I laid my account with a vio|lent
fit of illne&s;s from the cold I &s;hould in|fallibly
catch, if I e&s;caped a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, the
fears of which were the more trouble&s;ome as
I had no weapon to defend our lives. While
I laboured under the weight of my great|coat,
which made the &s;treams of &s;weat flow
down my face and &s;houlders, I was plung|ing
in the mud, up to the mid-leg at every
&s;tep; and at the &s;ame time obliged to &s;up|port
my wife, who wept in &s;ilence, half dead
with terror and fatigue. To crown our vexa|tion,
our conductor walked &s;o fa&s;t, that he
was often out of &s;ight, and I imagined he had
<PB N="181" REF="183">
run away with the boxes. All I could do,
on the&s;e occa&s;ions, was to hollow as loud as I
could, and &s;wear horribly that I would blow
his brains out. I did not know but the&s;e
oaths and menaces might keep other rogues
in awe. In this manner did we travel four
long miles, making almo&s;t an intire circuit
of the city-wall, without &s;eeing the face of
a human creature, and at length reached the
gate, where we were examined by the guard,
and allowed to pa&s;s, after they had told us it
was a long mile from thence to the hou&s;e of
Vanini, where we propo&s;ed to lodge. No
matter, being now fairly within the city, I
plucked up my &s;pirits, and performed the
re&s;t of the journey with &s;uch ea&s;e, that I am
per&s;uaded, I could have walked at the &s;ame
pace all night long, without being very much
fatigued. It was near ten at night, when we
entered the auberge in &s;uch a draggled and
mi&s;erable condition, that Mrs. Vanini almo&s;t
fainted at &s;ight of us, on the &s;uppo&s;ition
that we had met with &s;ome terrible di&s;a&s;ter,
and that the re&s;t of the company were killed.
My wife and I were immediately accommo|dated
with dry &s;tockings and &s;hoes, a warm
<PB N="182" REF="184">
apartment, and a good &s;upper, which I ate
with great &s;atisfaction, a$$$ing not only from
our having happily &s;urvived the adventure,
but al&s;o from a conviction that my &s;trength
and con&s;titution were wonderfully repaired: not
but that I &s;till expected a &s;evere cold, attended
with a terrible &s;it of the a&s;thma: but in this
I was luckily di&s;appointed. I now for the
fir&s;t time drank to the health of my phy&s;i|cian
Barazzi, fully per&s;uaded that the hard|&s;hips
and violent exerci&s;e I underwent by fol|lowing
his advice, had greatly contributed to
the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of my health. In this
particular, I imitate the gratitude of Taver|nier,
who was radically cured of the gout
by a Turki&s;h aga in AEgypt, who gave him
the ba&s;tinado, becau&s;e he would not look at
the head of the ba&s;haw of Cairo, which the
aga carried in a bag, to be pre&s;ented to the
grand &s;ignior at Con&s;tantinople.</P>
<P>I did not expect to &s;ee the re&s;t of our
company that night, as I never doubted but
they would &s;tay with the coach at the inn on
the other &s;ide of the Arno: but at mid-night
we were joined by Mi&s;s C&mdash;and Mr. R&mdash;,
who had left the carriage at the inn, under
<PB N="183" REF="185">
the au&s;pices of the captain and my &s;ervant,
and followed our foot-&s;teps by walking from
the ferry-boat to Florence, conducted by one
of the boatmen. Mr. R&mdash;&s;eemed to be
much ruffled and chagrined; but, as he did
not think proper to explain the cau&s;e, he had
no right to expect that I &s;hould give him &s;a|tisfaction
for &s;ome in&s;ult he had received from
my &s;ervant. They had been expo&s;ed to a
variety of di&s;agreeable adventures from the
impracticability of the road. The coach
had been &s;everal times in the mo&s;t imminent
hazard of being lo&s;t with all our baggage;
and at two different places, it was nece&s;&s;ary
to hire a dozen of oxen, and as many men,
to di&s;engage it from the holes into which it
had run. It was in the confu&s;ion of the&s;e
adventures, that the captain and his valet,
Mr. R&mdash;and my &s;ervant, had like to have
gone all by the ears together. The peace
was with difficulty pre&s;erved by the interpo|tion
of Mi&s;s C&mdash;, who &s;$ffered incredibly
from cold and wet, terror, vexation, and
fatigue: yet happily no bad con&s;equence
en&s;ued. The coach and baggage were brought
&s;afely into Florence next morning, when all
<PB N="184" REF="186">
of us found our&s;elves well refre&s;hed, and in
good &s;pirits. I am afraid this is not the ca&s;e

<OPENER><DATELINE>Nice, <DATE>March 20, 1765.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE &s;ea&s;on being far advanced, and
the weather growing boi&s;terous, I
made but a &s;hort &s;tay at Florence, and &s;et
out for Pi&s;a, with full re&s;olution to take the
neare&s;t road to Lerici, where we propo&s;ed
to hire a felucca for Genoa. I had a great
de&s;ire to &s;ee Leghorn and Lucca; but the
dread of a winter's voyage by &s;ea in an open
boat effectually re&s;trained my curio&s;ity. To
<PB N="185" REF="187">
avoid the trouble of having our baggage
&s;hifted every po&s;t, I hired two chai&s;es to Pi&s;a
for a couple of zequines, and there we ar|rived
in &s;afety about &s;even in the evening,
though not without fear of the con&s;equence,
as the cale&s;&s;es were quite open, and it rained
all the way. I mu&s;t own I was &s;o &s;ick of the
wretched accommodation one meets with in
every part of Italy, except the great cities,
&s;o aver&s;e to the &s;ea at this &s;ea&s;on, and &s;o fond
of the city of Pi&s;a, that I &s;hould certainly
have &s;tayed here the winter, had not I been
&s;eparated from my books and papers, as well
as from other conveniencies and connexions
which I had at Nice; and fore&s;een that the
thoughts of performing the &s;ame di&s;agreea|ble
voyage in the &s;pring would imbitter my
whole winter's enjoyment. I again hired
two cale&s;&s;es for Lerici, propo&s;ing to lie at
Sarzana, three miles &s;hort of that place,
where we were told we &s;hould find comforta|ble
lodging, and to embark next day with|out
halting. When we departed in the morn|ing,
it rained very hard, and the Cerchio,
which the chai&s;es had formerly pa&s;&s;ed, al|mo&s;t
<PB N="186" REF="188">
without wetting the wheels, was now
&s;welled to a mighty river, broad and deep
and rapid. It was with great difficulty I
could per&s;uade my wife to enter the boat;
for it blew a &s;torm, and &s;he had &s;een it
in coming over from the other &s;ide hurried
down a con&s;iderable way by the rapidity of
the current, notwi&s;tanding all the efforts of
the watermen. Near two hours were &s;pent
in tran&s;porting us with our chai&s;es. The
road between this and Spirto Santo was
rendered almo&s;t impa&s;&s;able. When we ar|rived
at Ma&s;&s;a, it began to grow dark, and
the po&s;t-ma&s;ter a&s;&s;ured us that the road to
Sarzana was overflowed in &s;uch a manner
as not to be pa&s;&s;ed even in the day-time,
without imminent danger. We therefore
took up our lodging for the night at this
hou&s;e, which was in all re&s;pects one of the
wor&s;t we had yet entered. Next day, we
found the Magra as large and violent as the
Cerchio: however, we pa&s;&s;ed it without any
accident, and in the afternoon arrived at
Lerici. There we were immediately be&s;ieged
by a number of patrons of &s;eluccas, from
<PB N="187" REF="189">
among whom I cho&s;e a Spaniard, partly
becau&s;e he looked like an hone&s;t man, and
produced an ample certificate, &s;igned by an
Engli&s;h gentleman; and partly, becau&s;e he
was not an Italian; for, by this time, I had
imbibed a &s;trong prejudice again&s;t the com|mon
people of that country. We embarked
in the morning before day, with a gale that
made us run the lee-gunwale in the water;
but, when we pretended to turn the point of
Porto Venere, we found the wind full in our
teeth, and were obliged to return to our quar|ters,
where we had been &s;hamefully fleeced
by the landlord, who, neverthele&s;s, was not
&s;uch an exorbitant knave as the po&s;t-ma&s;ter,
who&s;e hou&s;e I would advi&s;e all travellers to
avoid. Here, indeed, I had occa&s;ion to &s;ee
an in&s;tance of prudence and oeconomy, which
I &s;hould certainly imitate, if ever I had occa|&s;ion
to travel this way by my&s;elf. An Engli&s;h|man,
who had hired a felucca from Antibes
to Leghorn, was put in here by &s;tre&s;s of wea|ther;
but being aware of the extortion of
inn-keepers, and the bad accommodation in
their hou&s;es, he &s;lept on board on his own
<PB N="188" REF="190">
mattra&s;&s;es; and there likewi&s;e he had all his
conveniencies for eating. He &s;ent his &s;er|vant
on &s;hore occa&s;ionally to buy provi&s;ion,
and &s;ee it cooked according to his direction in
&s;ome public hou&s;e; and had his meals regu|larity
in the felucca. This evening he came
a&s;hore to &s;tretch his legs, and took a &s;olitary
walk on the beach, avoiding us with great
care, although he knew we were Engli&s;h:
his valet, who was abundantly communica|tive,
told my &s;ervant, that in coming through
France, his ma&s;ter had travelled three days
in company with two other Engli&s;h gentle|men,
whom he met upon the road, and in
all that time he never &s;poke a word to either:
yet in other re&s;pects, he was a good man,
mild, charitable, and humane. This is a
character truly Briti&s;h. At five o'clock in
the morning we put to &s;ea again, and though
the wind was contrary, made &s;hift to reach
the town of Se&s;tri di Levante, where we were
mo&s;t graciou&s;ly received by the publican
butcher and his family. The hou&s;e was in
much better order than before; the people
were much more obliging; we pa&s;&s;ed a very
<PB N="189" REF="191">
tolerable night, and had a very rea&s;onable bill
to pay in the morning. I cannot account
for this favourable change any other way,
than by a&s;cribing it to the effects of a ter|rible
&s;torm, which had two days before torn
up a great number of their olive-trees by
the roots, and done &s;uch damage as terri|fied
them into humility and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, Next
day, the water being delightful, we arrived
by one o'clock in the afternoon at Genoa.
Here I made another bargain with our pa|tron
Antonio, to carry us to Nice. He had
been hitherto remarkably obliging, and &s;eem|ingly
mode&s;t. He &s;poke Latin fluently, and
was tinctured with the &s;ciences. I began to
imagine he was a per&s;on of a good family,
who had met with misfortunes in life, and
re&s;pected him accordingly: but I found
him mercenary, mean, and rapacious. The
wind being &s;till contrary, when we departed
from Genoa, we could get no further than
Finale, where we lodged in a very di&s;mal
habitation, which was recommended to us as
the be&s;t auberge in the place. What ren|dered
it the more uncomfortable, the night
<PB N="190" REF="192">
was cold, and there was not a fire-place in
the hou&s;e, except in the kitchen. The beds
(if they de&s;erved that name) were &s;o &s;hock|ingly
na&s;ty, that we could not have u&s;ed
them, had not a friend of Mr. R&mdash;&s;up|plied
us with mattra&s;&s;es, &s;heets, and cover|lets;
for our own &s;heets were on board the
felucca, which was anchored at a di&s;tance
from the &s;hore. Our fare was equally
wretched: the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e was a
&s;urly a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, and his cameriere or waiter,
&s;tark-&s;taring mad. Our &s;ituation was at
the &s;ame time &s;hocking and ridiculous. Mr.
R&mdash;quarrelled over night with the ma&s;ter,
who &s;wore in broken French to my man,
that he had a good mind to poinard that
impertinent Piedmonte&s;e. In the morning
before day, Mr. R&mdash;, coming into my cham|ber,
gave me to under&s;tand that he had been
in&s;ulted by the landlord, who demanded &s;ix
and thirty livres for our &s;upper and lodging.
Incen&s;ed at the ra&s;cal's pre&s;umption, I a&s;&s;ured
him I would make him take half the money,
and a good beating into the bargain. He re|plied,
that he would have &s;aved me the trou|ble
of beating him, had not the cameriere,
<PB N="191" REF="193">
who was a very &s;en&s;ible fellow, a&s;&s;ured him
the patrone was out of his &s;en&s;es, and if
roughly handled, might commit &s;ome extra-vagance.
Though I was exceedingly ruffled,
I could not help laughing at the mad came|riere's
palming him&s;elf upon, R&mdash;i, as a
&s;en&s;ible fellow, and transferring the charge of
madne&s;s upon his ma&s;ter, who &s;eemed to be
much more knave than fool. While Mr.
R&mdash;went to ma&s;s, I de&s;ired the cameriere
to bid his ma&s;ter bring the bill, and to tell
him that if it was not rea&s;onable, I would
carry him before the commandant. In the
mean time I armed my&s;elf with my &s;word
in one hand and my cane in the other. The
inn-keeper immediately entered, pale and
&s;taring, and when I demanded his bill, he
told me, with a profound reverence, that he
&s;hould be &s;atisfied with whatever I my&s;elf
thought proper to give. Surpri&s;ed at this
moderation, I a&s;ked if he &s;hould be content
with twelve livres, and he an&s;wered, &startq;Con|tenti&s;&s;imo,&endq;
with another pro&s;tration. Then
he made an apology for the bad accommoda|tion
of his hou&s;e, and complained, that the
reproaches of the other gentleman, whom he
<PB N="192" REF="194">
was plea&s;ed to call my major-duomo, had al|mo&s;t
turned his brain. When he quitted the
room, his cameriere, laying hold of his
ma&s;ter's la&s;t words, pointed to his own fore|head,
and &s;aid, he had informed the gentle|man
over-night that his patron was mad.
This day we were by a high wind in the
afternoon, driven for &s;helter into Porto
Mauritio, where we found the po&s;t-hou&s;e
even wor&s;e than that of Finale; and what
rendered it more &s;hocking was a girl quite
covered with the confluent &s;mall-pox, who
lay in a room through which it was nece&s;&s;ary
to pa&s;s to the other chambers, and who &s;mell|ed
&s;o &s;trong as to perfume the whole hou&s;e.
We were but fifteen miles from St. Remo,
where I knew the auberge was tolerable, and
thither I re&s;olved to travel by land. I accord|ingly
ordered five mules to travel po&s;t, and
a very ridiculous cavalcade we formed, the
women being obliged to u&s;e common &s;addles;
for in this country even the ladies &s;it a&s;tride.
The road lay along one continued precipice,
and was &s;o difficult, that the bea&s;ts never
could exceed a walking pace. In &s;ome places
we were obliged to alight. Seven hours were
<PB N="193" REF="195">
&s;pent in travelling fifteen &s;hort miles: at
length we arrived at our old lodgings in St.
Remo, which we found white-wa&s;hed, and
in great order. We &s;upped pretty comforta|bly;
&s;lept well; and had no rea&s;on to com|plain
of impo&s;ition in paying the bill. This
was not the ca&s;e in the article of the mules,
for which I was obliged to pay fifty livres,
according to the regulation of the po&s;ts.
The po&s;t-ma&s;ter, who came along with us,
had the effrontery to tell me, that if I had
hired the mules to carry me and my com|pany
to St. Remo, in the way of common
travelling, they would have co&s;t me but
fifteen livres; but as I demanded po&s;t-hor&s;es,
I mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the regulations.
This is a di&s;tinction the more ab&s;urd, as the
road is of &s;uch a nature as renders it impo&s;|&s;ible
to travel fa&s;ter in one way than in ano|ther;
nor indeed is there the lea&s;t difference
either in the carriage or convenience, be|tween
travelling po&s;t and journey riding. A
publican might with the &s;ame rea&s;on charge
me three livres a pound for whiting, and if
que&s;tioned about the impo&s;ition, reply, that
<PB N="194" REF="196">
if I had a&s;ked for fi&s;h I &s;hould have had the
very &s;ame whiting for the fifth part of the
money: but that he made a wide difference
between &s;elling it as fi&s;h, and &s;elling it as
whiting. Our felucca came round from Porto
Mauritio in the night, and embarking next
morning, we arrived at Nice about four in
the afternoon.</P>
<P>Thus have I given you a circum&s;tantial
detail of my Italian expedition, during which
I was expo&s;ed to a great number of hard|&s;hips,
which I thought my weakened con&s;ti|tution
could not have bore; as well as to
violent fits of pa&s;&s;ion, chequered, however,
with tran&s;ports of a more agreeable nature;
in&s;omuch that I may &s;ay I was for two
months continually agitated either in mind
or body, and very often in both at the &s;ame
time. As my di&s;order at fir&s;t aro&s;e from a
&s;edentary life, producing a relaxation of the
fibres, which naturally brought on a li&s;tle&s;&s;|ne&s;s,
indolence, and dejection of the &s;pirits
$ I am convinced that this hard exerci&s;e of
mind and body, co-operated with the chang$
of air and objects, to brace up the relaxe$
<PB N="195" REF="197">
con&s;titution, and promote a more vigorous
circulation of the juices, which had long
langui&s;hed even almo&s;t to &s;tagnation. For
&s;ome years, I had been as &s;ubject to colds as
a delicate woman new delivered. If I ven|tured
to go abroad when there was the lea&s;t
moi&s;ture either in the air, or upon the
ground, I was &s;ure to be laid up a fortnight
with a cough and a&s;thma. But, in this
journey, I &s;uffered cold and rain, and &s;tood,
and walked in the wet, heated my&s;elf with
exerci&s;e, and &s;weated violently, without feel|ing
the lea&s;t di&s;order; but, on the contrary,
felt my&s;elf growing &s;tronger every day in
the mid&s;t of the&s;e exce&s;&s;es. Since my return
to Nice, it has rained the be&s;t part of two
months, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of all the people
in the country; yet during all that time I
have enjoyed good health and &s;pirits. On
Chri&s;tmas-Eve, I went to the cathedral at
mid-night, to hear high ma&s;s celebrated by
the new bi&s;hop of Nice, in pontif$calibus,
and &s;tood near two hours uncovered in a cold
gallery, without having any cau&s;e in the &s;equel
to repent of my curio&s;ity. In a word, I am
now &s;o well that I no longer de&s;pair of &s;eeing
<PB N="196" REF="198">

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU a&s;k whether I think the French
people are more taxed than the Engli&s;h;
but I apprehend, the que&s;tion would be more
apropos if you a&s;ked whether the French
taxes are more in&s;upportable than the Eng|li&s;h;
for, in comparing burthens, we ought
always to con&s;ider the &s;trength of the &s;houl|ders
that bear them. I know no better way
of e&s;timating the &s;trength, than by examin|ing
the face of the country, and ob&s;erving
the appearance of the common people, who
con&s;titute the bulk of every nation. When
<PB N="197" REF="199">
I, therefore, &s;ee the country of England
&s;miling with cultivation; the grounds exhi|biting
all the perfection of agriculture, par|celled
out into beautiful inclo&s;ures, corn|fields,
hay and pa&s;ture, woodland and com|mon;
when I &s;ee her meadows well &s;tocked
with black cattle; her downs covered with
&s;heep; when I view her teams of hor&s;es and
oxen, large and &s;trong, fat and &s;leek; when
I &s;ee her farm-hou&s;es the habitations of plenty,
cleanline&s;s, and convenience; and her pea|&s;ants
well fed, well lodged, well cloathed,
tall and &s;tout, and hale and jolly; I cannot
help concluding that the people are well able
to bear tho&s;e impo&s;itions which the public
nece&s;&s;ities have rendered nece&s;&s;ary. On the
other hand, when I perceive &s;uch &s;igns of
poverty, mi&s;ery, and dirt, among the com|monalty
of France, their unfenced fields dug
up in de&s;pair, without the intervention of
meadow or fallow ground, without cattle to
furni&s;h manure, without hor&s;es to execute
the plans of agriculture; their farm-hou&s;es
mean, their furniture wretched, their apparel
beggarly; them&s;elves and their bea&s;ts the
images of famine; I cannot help thinking
<PB N="198" REF="200">
they groan under oppre&s;&s;ion, either from their
landlords, or their government; probably
from both.</P>
<P>The principal impo&s;itions of the French
government are the&s;e: fir&s;t, the taille, payed
by all the commons, except tho&s;e that are
privileged: &s;econdly, the capitation, from
which no per&s;ons, (not even the nobles) are
excepted: thirdly, the tenths and twentieths,
called Dixi&ecirc;mes and Vingti&ecirc;mes, which every
body pays. This tax was originally levied as
an occa&s;ional aid in times of war, and other
emergencies; but by degrees is become a
&s;tanding revenue even in time of peace. All
the money ari&s;ing from the&s;e impo&s;itions
goes directly to the king's trea&s;ury; and mu&s;t
undoubtedly amount to a very great &s;um.
Be&s;ides the&s;e, he has the revenue of the
farms, con&s;i&s;ting of the droits d'aydes, or
exci&s;e on wine, brandy, &amp;c. of the cu&s;tom|hou&s;e
duties; of the gabelle, comprehending
that mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive obligation on individuals
to take a certain quantity of &s;alt at the
price which the farmers &s;hall plea&s;e to fix;
of the exclu&s;ive privilege to &s;ell tobacco; of
the droits de controlle, in$inuation, centi&ecirc;me
<PB N="199" REF="201">
denier, franchiefs, aubeine, echange et contre|echange
ari&s;ing from the acts of voluntary
juri&s;diction, as well as certain law-&s;uits.
The&s;e farms are &s;aid to bring into the king's
coffers above one hundred and twenty mil|lions
of livres yearly, amounting to near
five millions &s;terling: but the poor people
are &s;aid to pay about a third more than this
&s;um, which the farmers retain to enrich
them&s;elves, and bribe the great for their pro|tection;
which protection of the great is
the true rea&s;on why this mo&s;t iniquitous, op|pre&s;&s;ive,
and ab&s;urd method of levying mo|ney
is not laid a&s;ide. Over and above tho&s;e
articles I have mentioned, the French king
draws con&s;iderable &s;ums from his clergy, un|der
the denomination of dons gratuits, or
free-gifts; as well as from the &s;ub&s;idies given
by the pays d'etats, &s;uch as Provence, Lan|guedoc,
and Bretagne, which are exempted
from the taille. The whole revenue of the
French king amounts to between twelve and
thirteen millions &s;terling. The&s;e are great
re&s;ources for the king: but they will always
keep the people mi&s;erable, and effectually
prevent them from making &s;uch improve|ments
<PB N="200" REF="202">
as might turn their lands to the be&s;t
advantage. But be&s;ides being ea&s;ed in the
article of taxes, there is &s;omething el&s;e re|quired
to make them exert them&s;elves for the
benefit of their country. They mu&s;t be free
in their per&s;ons, &s;ecure in their property, in|dulged
with rea&s;onable lea&s;es, and effectually
protected by law from the in&s;olence and op|pre&s;&s;ion
of their &s;uperiors.</P>
<P>Great as the French king's re&s;ources may
appear, they are hardly &s;ufficient to defray
the enormous expence of his government.
About two millions &s;terling per annum of
his revenue are &s;aid to be anticipated for
paying the intere&s;t of the public debts; and
the re&s;t is found inadequate to the charge of
a prodigious &s;tanding army, a double fron|tier
of fortified towns, and the extravagant
appointments of amba&s;&s;adors, generals, go|vernors,
intendants, commandants, and other
officers of the crown, all of whom affect a
pomp, which is equally ridiculous and pro|digal.
A French general in the field is al|ways
attended by thirty or forty cooks; and
thinks it is incumbent upon him, for the
glory of France, to give a hundred di&s;hes
<PB N="201" REF="203">
every day at his table. When don Philip,
and the marechal duke de Bellei&s;le, had their
quarters at Nice, there were fifty &s;cullions
con&s;tantly employed in the great &s;quare in
plucking poultry. This ab&s;urd luxury infects
their whole army. Even the commi&s;&s;aries
keep open table; and nothing is &s;een but
prodigality arid profu&s;ion. The king of Sar|dinia
proceeds upon another plan. His
troops are better cloathed, better payed, and
better fed than tho&s;e of France. The com|mandant
of Nice has about four hundred a
year of appointments, which enable him to
live decently, and even to entertain &s;trangers.
On the other hand, the commandant of An|tibes,
which is in all re&s;pects more incon&s;i|derable
than Nice, has from the French king
above five times the &s;um to &s;upport the
glory of his monarch, which all the &s;en&s;ible
part of mankind treat with ridicule and con|tempt.
But the finances of France are &s;o
ill managed, that many of their command|ants,
and other officers, have hot been able
to draw their appointments the&s;e two years.
In vain they complain and remon&s;trate.
When they grow trouble&s;ome they are re|moved.
<PB N="202" REF="204">
How then mu&s;t they &s;upport the
glory of France? how, but by oppre&s;&s;ing
the poor people. The trea&s;urer makes u&s;e
of their money for his own benefit. The
king knows it; he knows his officers thus
defrauded, fleece and oppre&s;s his people:
but he thinks proper to wink at the&s;e
abu&s;es. That government may be &s;aid
to be weak and tottering which finds it&s;elf
obliged to connive at &s;uch proceedings.
The king of France, in order to give &s;trength
and &s;tability to his admini&s;tration, ought to
have &s;en&s;e to adopt a &s;age plan of oeconomy,
and vigour of mind &s;ufficient to execute it in
all its parts, with the mo&s;t rigorous exactne&s;s.
He ought to have courage enough to find
fault, and even to puni&s;h the delinquents, of
what quality &s;oever they may be: and the fir&s;t
act of reformation ought to be a total abo|lition
of all the farms. There are, undoubt|edly,
many marks of relaxation in the reins
of the French government, and, in all pro|bability,
the &s;ubjects of France will be the
fir&s;t to take advantage of it. There is at
pre&s;ent a violent fermentation of different
principles among them, which under the reign
<PB N="203" REF="205">
of a very weak prince, or during a long mi|nority,
may produce a great change in the
con&s;titution. In proportion to the progre&s;s
of rea&s;on and philo&s;ophy, which have made
great advances in this kingdom, &s;uper&s;tition
lo&s;es ground; antient prejudices give way;
a &s;pirit of freedom takes the a&s;cendant. All
the learned laity of France dete&s;t the hie|rarchy
as a plan of de&s;poti&s;m, founded on im|po&s;ture
and u&s;urpation. The prote&s;tants,
who are very numerous in the &s;outhern parts,
abhor it with all the rancour of religious
fanatici&s;m. Many of the commons, en|riched
by commerce and manufacture, grow
impatient of tho&s;e odious di&s;tinctions, which
exclude them from the honours and privi|leges
due to their importance in the com|monwealth;
and all the parliaments, or
tribunals of ju&s;tice in the kingdom, &s;eem
bent upon a&s;&s;erting their rights and inde|pendence
in the face of the king's prerogative,
and even at the expence of his power and
authority. Should any prince therefore be
&s;educed by evil coun&s;ellors, or mi&s;led by his
own bigotry, to take &s;ome arbitrary &s;tep, that
may be extremely di&s;agreeable to all tho&s;e
<PB N="204" REF="206">
communities, without having &s;pirit to exert
the violence of his power for the &s;upport of
his mea&s;ures, he will become equally de|te&s;ted
and de&s;pi&s;ed; and the influence of the
commons will in&s;en&s;ibly encroach upon the
preten&s;ions of the crown. But if in the
time of a minority, the power of the go|vernment
&s;hould be divided among different
competitors for the regency, the parliaments
and people will find it &s;till more ea&s;y to ac|quire
and a&s;certain the liberty at which they
a&s;pire, becau&s;e they will have the balance of
power in their hands, and be able to make
either &s;cale preponderate. I could &s;ay a great
deal more upon this &s;ubject; and I have &s;ome
remarks to make relating to the methods
which might be taken in ca&s;e of a fre&s;h rup|ture
with France, for making a vigorous im|pre&s;&s;ion
on that kingdom. But the&s;e I mu&s;t
defer till another occa&s;ion, having neither
room nor lei&s;ure at pre&s;ent to add any thing,

<OPENER><DATELINE>Nice, <DATE>April 2, 176$.</DATE></DATELINE>
DEAR DOCTOR,</OPENER>
<P>AS I have now pa&s;&s;ed a &s;econd winter at
Nice I think my&s;elf qualified to make
&s;ome further remarks on this climate. Du|ring
the heats of la&s;t &s;ummer, I flattered
my&s;elf with the pro&s;pect of the fine weather
I &s;hould enjoy in the winter; but neither I,
nor any per&s;on in this country, could fore&s;ee
the rainy weather that prevailed from the
middle of November, till the twentieth of
March. In this &s;hort period of four months,
we have had fifty-&s;ix days of rain, which I
take to be a greater quantity than generally
falls during the &s;ix wor&s;t months of the year
in the county of Middle&s;ex, e&s;pecially as it
was, for the mo&s;t part, a heavy, continued
rain. The &s;outh winds generally predomi|nate
in the wet &s;ea&s;on at Nice: but this
winter the rain was accompanied with every
wind that blows, except the &s;outh; though
<PB N="206" REF="208">
the mo&s;t frequent were tho&s;e that came from
the ea&s;t and north quarters. Notwith&s;tand|ing
the&s;e great rains, &s;uch as were never
known before at Nice in the memory of man,
the intermediate days of fair weather were
delightful, and the ground &s;eemed perfectly
dry. The air it&s;elf was perfectly free from
moi&s;ture. Though I live upon a ground
floor, &s;urrounded on three &s;ides by a garden,
I could not perceive the lea&s;t damp, either
on the floors, or the furniture; neither was
I much incommoded by the a&s;thma, which u&s;ed
always to harra&s;s me mo&s;t in wet weather. In
a word, I pa&s;&s;ed the winter here much more
comfortably than I expected. About the
vernal equinox, however, I caught a violent
cold, which was attended with a difficulty of
breathing, and as the &s;un advances towards
the tropic, I find my&s;elf &s;till more &s;ubject to
rheums. As the heat increa&s;es, the humours
of the body are rarefied, and, of con&s;equence,
the pores of the &s;kin are opened; while the
ea&s;t wind &s;weeping over the Alps and Ap|penines,
covered with &s;now, continues &s;ur|pri&s;ingly
&s;harp and penetrating. Even the
people of the country, who enjoy good health,
<PB N="207" REF="209">
are afraid of expo&s;ing them&s;elves to the air
at this &s;ea&s;on, the intemperature of which
may la&s;t till the middle of May, when all
the &s;now on the mountains will probably
be melted: then the air will become mild
and balmy, till, in the progre&s;s of &s;ummer, it
grows di&s;agreeably hot, and the &s;trong eva|poration
from the &s;ea makes it &s;o &s;aline, as
to be unhealthy for tho&s;e who have a &s;cor|butical
habit. When the &s;ea-breeze is high,
this evaporation is &s;o great as to cover the
&s;urface of the body with a kind of volatile
brine, as I plainly perceived la&s;t &s;ummer. I
am more and more convinced that this cli|mate
is unfavourable for the &s;curvy. Were
I obliged to pa&s;s my life in it, I would en|deavour
to find a country retreat among the
mountains, at &s;ome di&s;tance from the &s;ea,
where I might enjoy a cool air, free from this
impregnation, unmole&s;ted by tho&s;e flies,
gnats, and other vermin, which render the
lower parts almo&s;t uninhabitable. To this
place I would retire in the month of June,
and there continue till the beginning of
October, when I would return to my habi|tation
in Nice, where the winter is remark|ably
<PB N="208" REF="210">
mild and agreeable. In March and
April however, I would not advi&s;e a valetu|dinarian
to go forth, without taking precau|tion
again&s;t the cold. An agreeable &s;ummer
retreat may be found on the other &s;ide of the
Var, at, or near the town of Gra&s;&s;e, which is
Plea&s;antly &s;ituated on the a&s;cent of a hill in
Provence, about &s;even Engli&s;h miles from
Nice. This place is famous for its pomatum,
gloves, wa&s;h-balls, perfumes, and toilette-boxes,
lined with bergamot. I am told it
affords good lodging, and is well &s;upplied
with provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>We are now preparing for our journey to
England, from the exerci&s;e of which I pro|mi&s;e
my&s;elf much benefit: a journey ex|tremely
agreeable, not only on that account,
but al&s;o becau&s;e it will re&s;tore me to the
company of my friends, and remove me
from a place where I leave nothing but
the air, which I can po&s;&s;ibly regret. The
only friend&s;hip I have contracted at Nice
are with &s;trangers, who, like my&s;elf, only
&s;ojourn here for a &s;ea&s;on. I now find by
experience, it is great folly to buy furni|ture,
unle&s;s one is re&s;olved to &s;ettle here
<PB N="209" REF="211">
for &s;ome years. The Ni&s;&s;ards a&s;&s;ured me,
with great confidence, that I &s;hould always
be able to &s;ell it for a very little lo&s;s; whereas
I find my&s;elf obliged to part with it for
about one-third of what it co&s;t. I have
&s;ent for a coach to Aix, and as &s;oon as
it arrives, &s;hall take my departure; &s;o
that the next letter you receive from me
will be dated at &s;ome place on the road.
I purpo&s;e to take Antibes, Toulon, Mar|&s;eilles,
Aix, Avignon, and Orange, in my
way: places which I have not yet &s;een;
and where, perhaps, I &s;hall find &s;omething
for your amu&s;ement, which will always be
a con&s;ideration of &s;ome weight with,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To Dr. S&mdash;at Nice.
<DATELINE>Turin, <DATE>March 18, 1765.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am ju&s;t returned from an excur&s;ion to
Turin, which is about thirty leagues from
hence, the greater part of the way lying over
frightful mountains covered with &s;now. The
difficulty of the road, however, reaches no
farther than Coni, from whence there is an
open highway through a fine plain country,
as far as the capital of Piedmont, and the tra|veller
is accommodated with chai&s;e and hor&s;es
to proceed either po&s;t, or by cambiatura, as in
other parts of Italy. There are only two
ways of performing the journey over the
mountains from Nice; one is to ride a mule|back,
and the other to be carried in a chair.
The former I cho&s;e, and &s;et out with my
&s;ervant on the &s;eventh day of February at
two in the afternoon. I was hardly clear of
Nice, when it began to rain &s;o hard that in
<PB N="211" REF="213">
le&s;s than an hour the mud was half a foot
deep in many parts of the road. This was
the only inconvenience we &s;uffered, the way
being in other re&s;pects practicable enough;
for there is but one &s;mall hill to cro&s;s on this
&s;ide of the village of L'E&s;carene, where we
arrived about &s;ix in the evening. The ground
in this neighbourhood is tolerably cultivated,
and the mountains are planted to the tops
with olive trees. The accommodation here
is &s;o very bad, that I had no inclination to
be a bed longer than was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary
for refre&s;hment; and therefore I proceeded on
my journey at two in the morning, con|ducted
by a guide, whom I hired for this
purpo&s;e at the rate of three livres a day.
Having a&s;cended one &s;ide, and de&s;cended the
other, of the mountain called Braus, which
took up four hours, though the road is not
bad, we at fix reached the village of So&s;pello,
which is agreeably &s;ituated in a &s;mall valley,
&s;urrounded by prodigious high and barren
mountains. This little plain is pretty fertile,
and being watered by a plea&s;ant &s;tream,
forms a delightful contra&s;t with the hideous
rocks that &s;urround it. Having repo&s;ed my|&s;elf
<PB N="212" REF="214">
and my mules two hours at this place,
we continued our journey over the &s;econd
mountain, called Brovis, which is rather more
con&s;iderable than the fir&s;t, and in four hours
arrived at La Giandola, a tolerable inn &s;itu|ated
betwixt the high road and a &s;mall ri|ver,
about a gun&s;hot from the town of
Brieglie, which we leave on the right. As
we jogged along in the grey of the morning,
I was a little &s;tartled at two figures which I &s;aw
before me, and began to put my pi&s;tols in
order. It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved that the&s;e moun|tains
are infe&s;ted with <HI>contrabandiers,</HI> a &s;et of
&s;muggling pea&s;ants, very bold and de&s;perate,
who make a traffic of &s;elling tobacco, &s;alt,
and other merchandize, which have not payed
duty, and &s;ometimes lay travellers under con|tribution.
I did not doubt but there was a
gang of the&s;e free-booters at hand; but as
no more than two per&s;ons appeared, I re|&s;olved
to let them know we were prepared
for defence, and fired one of my pi&s;tols, in
hope that the report of it, echoed from the
&s;urrounding rocks, would produce a proper
effect: but, the mountains and roads being
entirely covered with &s;now to a con&s;iderable
<PB N="213" REF="215">
depth, there was little or no reverberation,
and the &s;ound was not louder than that of a
pop-gun, although the piece contained a good
charge of powder. Neverthele&s;s, it did not
fail to engage the attention of the &s;trangers,
one of whom immediately wheeled to the left
about, and being by this time very near me,
gave me an opportunity of contemplating
his whole per&s;on. He was very tall, meagre,
and yellow, with a long hooked no&s;e, and
&s;mall twinkling eyes. His head was ca&s;ed in
a woollen night-cap, over which he wore a
flapped hat; he had a &s;ilk handkerchief a|bout
his neck, and his mouth was furni&s;hed
with a &s;hort wooden pipe, from which he
di&s;charged wreathing clouds of tobacco-&s;moke.
He was wrapped in a kind of capot of green
bays, lined with wolf-&s;kin, had a pair of
mon&s;trous boots, quilted on the in&s;ide with
cotton, was almo&s;t covered with dirt, and
rode a mule &s;o low that his long legs hung
dangling within &s;ix inches of the ground.
This grote&s;que figure was &s;o much more ludi|crous
than terrible, that I could not help
laughing; when taking his pipe out of his
mouth, he very politely acco&s;ted me by name.
<PB N="214" REF="216">
You may ea&s;ily gue&s;s I was exceedingly &s;ur|pri&s;ed
at &s;uch an addre&s;s on the top of the
mountain Brovis: but he forthwith put an
end to it to, by di&s;covering him&s;elf to be the
marquis M. whom I had the honour to be
acquainted with at Nice. After having ral|lied
him upon his equipage, he gave me to
under&s;tand he had &s;et out from Nice the
morning of the &s;ame day that I departed;
that he was going to Turin, and that he had
&s;ent one of his &s;ervants before him to Coni
with his baggage. Knowing him to be an
agreeable companion, I was glad of this en|counter,
and we re&s;olved to travel the re&s;t of
the way together. We dined atLa Giandola,
and in the afternoon rode along the little
river Roida, which runs in a bottom between
frightful precipices, and in &s;everal places
forms natural ca&s;cades, the noi&s;e of which
had well-nigh deprived us of the &s;en&s;e of
hearing; after a winding cour&s;e among the&s;e
mountains, it di&s;charges it&s;elf into the Medi|terranean
at Vintimiglia, in the territory of
Genoa. As the &s;now did not lie on the&s;e
mountains, when we cracked our whips, there
was &s;uch a repercu&s;&s;ion of the &s;ound as is al|together
<PB N="215" REF="217">
inconceivable. We pa&s;&s;ed by the vil|lage
of Saorgio, &s;ituated on an eminence,
where there is a &s;mall fortre&s;s which com|mands
the whole pa&s;s, and in five hours ar|rived
at our inn, on this &s;ide the Col de Tende,
where we took up our quarters, but had very
little rea&s;on to boa&s;t of our entertainment.
Our greate&s;t difficulty, however, con&s;i&s;ted in
pulling off the marquis's boots, which were
of the kind called Seafarot, by this time &s;o
loaded with dirt on the out&s;ide, and &s;o &s;welled
with the rain within, that he could neither
drag them after him as he walked, nor di&s;en|cumber
his legs of them, without &s;uch vio|lence
as &s;eemed almo&s;t &s;ufficient to tear him
limb from limb. In a word, we were obliged
to tie a rope about his heel, and all the peo|ple
in the hou&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;ting to pull, the poor
marquis was drawn from one end of the a|partment
to the other before the boot would
give way: at la&s;t his legs were happily di&s;|engaged,
and the machines carefully dried
and &s;tuffed for next day's journey.</P>
<P>We took our departure from hence at three
in the morning, and at four, began to mount
the Col de Tende, which is by far the highe&s;t
<PB N="216" REF="218">
mountain in the whole journey: it was now
quite covered with &s;now, which at the top of
it was near twenty feet thick. Half way up,
there are quarters for a detachment of &s;ol|diers,
po&s;ted here to prevent &s;muggling, and
an inn called La Ca, which in the language
of the country &s;ignifies the hou&s;e. At this
place, we hired &s;ix men to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in a&s;cend|ing
the mountain, each of them provided
with a kind of hough to break the ice, and
make a &s;ort of &s;teps for the mules. When
we were near the top, however, we were
obliged to alight, and climb the mountain
&s;upported each by two of tho&s;e men, called
Coulants, who walk upon the &s;now with
great firmne&s;s and &s;ecurity. We were fol|lowed
by the mules, and though they are
very &s;ure-footed animals, and were fro&s;t-&s;hod
for the occa&s;ion, they &s;tumbled and fell very
often; the ice being &s;o hard that the &s;harp
headed nails in their &s;hoes could not pene|trate.
Having reached the top of this moun|tain,
from whence there is no pro&s;pect but
of other rocks and mountains, we prepared
for de&s;cending on the other &s;ide by the Leze,
which is an occa&s;ional &s;ledge made of two
<PB N="217" REF="219">
pieces of wood, carried up by the Coulants
for this purpo&s;e. I did not much reli&s;h this
kind of carriage, e&s;pecially as the mountain
was very &s;teep, and covered with &s;uch a thick
fog that we could hardly &s;ee two or three
yards before us. Neverthele&s;s, our guides
were &s;o confident, and my companion, who
had pa&s;&s;ed the &s;ame way on other occa&s;ions,
was &s;o &s;ecure, that I ventured to place my&s;elf
on this machine, one of the coulants &s;tand|ing
behind me, and the other &s;itting before,
as the conductor, with his feet paddling
among the &s;now, in order to moderate the ve|locity
of its de&s;cent. Thus accommodated, we
de&s;cended the mountain with &s;uch rapidity,
that in an hour we reached Limon, which is
the native place of almo&s;t all the muleteers
who tran&s;port merchandize from Nice to Coni
and Turin. Here we waited full two hours
for the mules, which travelled with the &s;er|vants
by the common road. To each of
the coulants we paid forty &s;ols, which are
nearly equal to two &s;hillings &s;terling. Leav|ing
Limon, we were in two hours quite di&s;|engaged
from the gorges of the mountains,
which are partly covered with wood and
<PB N="218" REF="220">
pa&s;turage, though altogether inacce&s;&s;ible, ex|cept
in &s;ummer; but from the foot of the
Col de Tende, the road lies through a plain
all the way to Turin. We took &s;ix hours
to travel from the inn where we had lodged
over the mountain to Limon, and five hours
from thence to Coni. Here we found our
baggage, which we had &s;ent off by the car|riers
one day before we departed from Nice;
and here we di&s;mi&s;&s;ed our guides, together
with the mules. In winter, you have a mule
for this whole journey at the rate of twenty
livres; and the guides are payed at the rate
of two livres a day, reckoning &s;ix days, three
for the journey to Coni, and three for their
return to Nice. We &s;et out &s;o early in the
morning in order to avoid the inconvenien|cies
and dangers that attend the pa&s;&s;age of
this mountain. The fir&s;t of the&s;e ari&s;es
from your meeting with long &s;trings of loaded
mules in a &s;lippery road, the breadth of which
does not exceed a foot and an half. As it is
altogether impo&s;&s;ible for two mules to pa&s;s
each other in &s;uch a narrow path, the mule|teers
have made doublings or elbows in dif|ferent
parts, and when the troops of mule$
<PB N="219" REF="221">
meet, the lea&s;t numerous is obliged to turn
off into one of the&s;e doublings, and there
halt until the others are pa&s;t. Travellers in
order to avoid this di&s;agreeable delay, which
is the more vexatious, con&s;idering the exce&s;&s;ive
cold, begin the a&s;cent of the mountain early
in the morning before the mules quit their
inns. But the great danger of travelling here
when the &s;un is up, proceeds from what they
call the Valanches. The&s;e are balls of &s;now
detached from the mountains which over top
the road, either by the heat of the &s;un, or the
humidity of the weather. A piece of &s;now
thus loo&s;ened from the rock, though perhaps
not above three or four feet in diameter, in|crea&s;es
&s;ometimes in its de&s;cent to &s;uch a de|gree,
as to become two hundred paces in
length, and rolls down with &s;uch rapidity,
that the traveller is cru&s;hed to death before
he can make three &s;teps on the road. The&s;e
dreadful heaps drag every thing along with
them in their de&s;cent. They tear up huge
trees by the roots, and if they chance to fall
upon a hou&s;e, demoli&s;h it to the foundation.
Accidents of this nature &s;eldom happen in
the winter while the weather is dry; and yet
<PB N="220" REF="222">
&s;carce a year pa&s;&s;es in which &s;ome mules and
their drivers do not peri&s;h by the valanches.
At Coni we found the counte&s;s C&mdash;from
Nice, who had made the &s;ame journey in a
chair, carried by porters. This is no other
than a common elbow-chair of wood, with a
&s;traw bottom, covered above with waxed cloth,
to protect the traveller from the rain or &s;now,
and provided with a foot-board upon which
the feet re&s;t. It is carried like a &s;edan-chair;
and for this purpo&s;e &s;ix or eight porters are
employed at the rate of three or four livres a
head per day, according to the &s;ea&s;on, allow|ing
three days for their return. Of the&s;e &s;ix
men, two are between the poles carrying like
common chairmen, and each of the&s;e is &s;up|ported
by the other two, one at each hand:
but as tho&s;e in the middle &s;u&s;tain the greate&s;t
burthen, they are relieved by the others in a
regular rotation. In de&s;cending the moun|tain,
they carry the poles on their &s;houlders,
and in that ca&s;e, four men are employed, one
at each end.</P>
<P>At Coni, you may have a chai&s;e to go
with the &s;ame hor&s;es to Turin, for which
you pay fifteen livres, and are a day and a
<PB N="221" REF="223">
half on the way. You may po&s;t it, however,
in one day, and then the price is &s;even livres
ten &s;ols per po&s;t, and ten &s;ols to the po&s;tilion.
The method we took was that of cambiatura.
This is a chai&s;e with hor&s;es &s;hifted at the
&s;ame &s;tages that are u&s;ed in po&s;ting: but as
it is &s;uppo&s;ed to move &s;lower, we pay but
five livres per po&s;t, and ten &s;ols to the po&s;ti|lion.
In order to quicken its pace, we gave
ten &s;ols extraordinary to each po&s;tilion, and
for this gratification, he drove us even fa&s;ter
than the po&s;t. The chai&s;es are like tho&s;e of
Italy, and will take on near two hundred
weight of baggage.</P>
<P>Coni is &s;ituated between two &s;mall &s;treams,
and though neither very large nor populous,
is con&s;iderable for the &s;trength of its fortifica|tions.
It is honoured with the title of the
Maiden-Fortre&s;s, becau&s;e though &s;everal times
be&s;ieged, it was never taken. The prince of
Conti inve&s;ted it in the war of 1744; but he
was obliged to rai&s;e the &s;iege, after having
given battle to the king of Sardinia. The

<OPENER><DATELINE>Aix en Provence, <DATE>May 10, 1765.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM thus far on my way to England. I
had re&s;olved to leave Nice, without hav|ing
the lea&s;t di&s;pute with any one native of
the place; but I found it impo&s;&s;ible to keep
this re&s;olution. My landlord, Mr. C&mdash;, a
man of fa&s;hion, with who&s;e family we had
always lived in friend&s;hip, was &s;o rea&s;onable
as to expect I &s;hould give him up the hou&s;e
and garden, though they were to be paid
for till Michaelmas, and peremptorily de|clared
I &s;hould not be permitted to &s;ub-let
them to any other per&s;on. He had of his
own accord a&s;&s;ured me more than once that
he would take my furniture off my hands,
and tru&s;ting to this a&s;&s;urance, I had lo&s;t the
opportunity of di&s;po&s;ing it to advantage:
but, when the time of my departure drew
near, he refu&s;ed to take it, at the &s;ame time
<PB N="224" REF="226">
in&s;i&s;ting upon having the key of the hou&s;e
and garden, as well as on being paid the
whole rent directly, though it would not be
due till the middle of September. I was &s;o
exa&s;perated at this treatment from a man
whom I had cultivated with particular re|&s;pect,
that I determined to conte&s;t it at law:
but the affair was accommodated by the
mediation of a father of the Minims, a friend
to both, and a merchant of Nice, who
charged him&s;elf with the care of the hou&s;e
and furniture. A &s;tranger mu&s;t conduct him|&s;elf
with the utmo&s;t circum&s;pection to be able
to live among the&s;e people without being the
dupe of impo&s;ition.</P>
<P>I had &s;ent to Aix for a coach and four
hor&s;es, which I hired at the rate of eighteen
French livres a day, being equal to fifteen
&s;hillings and nine-pence &s;terling. The river
Var was &s;o &s;welled by the melting of the
&s;now on the mountains, as to be impa&s;&s;able
by any wheel-carriage; and, therefore, the
coach remained at Antibes, to which we went
by water, the di&s;tance being about nine or
ten miles. This is the Antipolis of the an|tients,
&s;aid to have been built like Nice, by a
<PB N="225" REF="227">
colony from Mar&s;eilles. In all probability,
however, it was later than the foundation of
Nice, and took its name from its being &s;i|tuated
directly oppo&s;ite to that city. Pliny
&s;ays it was famous for its tunny-fi&s;hery; and
to this circum&s;tance Martial alludes in the
following lines:
<Q><L>&startq;Antipolitani, fateor, &s;um filia thynni.</L>
<L>E&s;&s;em &s;i Scombri non tibi mi&s;&s;a forem.&endq;</L></Q>
At pre&s;ent, it is the frontier of France towards
Italy, pretty &s;trongly fortified, and garri&s;oned
by a battalion of &s;oldiers. The town is &s;mall
and incon&s;iderable: but the ba&s;in of the har|bour
is &s;urrounded to &s;eaward by a curious
bulwark founded upon piles driven in the
water, con&s;i&s;ting of a wall, ramparts, ca&s;e|mates,
and quay. Ve&s;&s;els lie very &s;afe in this
harbour; but there is $ot water at the en|trance
of it to admit of $$ips of any burthen.
The &s;hallows run &s;o far off from the coa&s;t,
that a &s;hip of force cannot lie near enough
to batter the town; but it was bombarded in
the late war. Its chief &s;trength by land
con&s;i&s;ts in a &s;mall quadrangular fort de|tached
from the body of the place, which,
<PB N="226" REF="228">
in a particular manner, commands the en|trance
of the harbour. The wall of the
town built in the &s;ea has embra&s;ures and &s;a|liant
angles, on which a great number of
cannon may be mounted.</P>
<P>I think the adjacent country is much more
plea&s;ant than that on the &s;ide of Nice; and
there is certainly no e&s;&s;ential difference in the
climate. The ground here is not &s;o encum|bered;
it is laid out in agreeable inclo&s;ures,
with intervals of open fields, and the moun|tains
ri&s;e with an ea&s;y a&s;cent at a much greater
di&s;tance from the &s;ea, than on the other &s;ide
of the bay. Be&s;ides, here are charming rides
along the beach, which is &s;mooth and firm,
When we pa&s;&s;ed in the la&s;t week of April, the
corn was the in ear; the cherries were almo&s;t
ripe; and the figs had begun to blacken. I
had embarked my heavy baggage on board a
London &s;hip, which happened to be at Nice,
ready to &s;ail: as for our &s;mall trunks or port|manteaus,
which we carried along with us,
they were examined at Antibes; but the cere|mony
was performed very &s;uperficially, in
con&s;equence of tipping the &s;earcher with half
<PB N="227" REF="229">
a crown, which is a wonderful conciliator at
all the bureaus in this country.</P>
<P>We lay at Cannes, a neat village, charm|ingly
&s;ituated on the beach of the Mediter|ranean,
exactly oppo&s;ite to the i&s;les Mar|guerites,
where &s;tate-pri&s;oners are confined.
As there are &s;ome good hou&s;es in this place,
I would rather live here for the &s;ake of the
mild climate, than either at Antibes or Nice.
Here you are not cooped up within walls,
nor crouded with &s;oldiers and people: but are
already in the country, enjoy a fine air, and
are well &s;upplied with all &s;orts of fi&s;h.</P>
<P>The mountain of E&s;terelles, which in one
of my former letters I de&s;cribed as a mo&s;t
romantic and noble plantation of ever-greens,
trees, &s;hrubs, and aromatic plants, is at pre|&s;ent
quite de&s;olate. La&s;t &s;ummer, &s;ome exe|crable
villains &s;et fire to the pines, when the
wind was high. It continued burning for
months, and the conflagration extended above
ten leagues, con&s;uming an incredible quan|tity
of timber. The ground is now naked
on each &s;ide of the road, or occupied by the
black trunks of the trees, which have been
&s;corched without falling. They &s;tand as &s;o
<PB N="228" REF="230">
many monuments of the judgment of heaven,
filling the mind with horror and compa&s;&s;ion.
I could hardly refrain from &s;hedding tears at
this di&s;mal &s;pectacle, when I recalled the
idea of what it was about eighteen months
ago.</P>
<P>As we &s;tayed all night at Frejus, I had an
opportunity of viewing the amphitheatre at
lei&s;ure. As near as I can judge by the eye, it
is of the &s;ame dimen&s;ions with that of Ni&s;mes;
but &s;hockingly dilapidated. The &s;tone &s;eats
ri&s;ing from the arena are &s;till extant, and
the cells under them, where the wild bea&s;ts
were kept. There are likewi&s;e the remains
of two galleries one over another; and two
vomitoria or great gateways at oppo&s;ite &s;ides
of the arena, which is now a fine green,
with a road through the middle of it: but
all the external architecture and the orna|ments
are demoli&s;hed. The mo&s;t intire part
of the wall now con&s;titutes part of a mona&s;|tery,
the monks of which, I am told, have
helped to de&s;troy the amphitheatre, by re|moving
the &s;tones for their own purpo&s;es of
building. In the neighbourhood of this am|phitheatre,
which &s;tands without the walls,
<PB N="229" REF="231">
are the ve&s;tiges of an old edifice, &s;aid to have
been the palace where the imperator or pre&s;i|dent
re&s;ided: for it was a Roman colony,
much favoured by Julius Cae&s;ar, who gave it
the name of Forum Julii, and Civitas Foro|julien&s;is.
In all probability, it was he who
built the amphitheatre, and brought hither
the water ten leagues from the river of
Ciagne, by means of an aqueduct, &s;ome
arcades of which are &s;till &s;tanding on the
other &s;ide of the town. A great number of
&s;tatues were found in this place, together
with antient in&s;criptions, which have been
publi&s;hed by different authors. I need not
tell you that Julius Agricola, the father-in-law
of Tacitus, the hi&s;torian, was a native of
Frejus, which is now a very poor incon&s;i|derable
place. From hence the country
opens to the left, forming an exten&s;ive plain
between the &s;ea and the mountains, which
are a continuation of the Alps, that &s;tretches
through Provence and Dauphin&eacute;. This plain
watered with plea&s;ant &s;treams, and varied
with vineyards, corn-fields, and meadow-ground,
afforded a mo&s;t agreeable pro&s;pect
$o our eyes, which were accu&s;tomed to the
<PB N="230" REF="232">
&s;ight of &s;corching &s;ands, rugged rocks, and
abrupt mountains in the neighbourhood of
Nice. Although this has much the appear|ance
of a corn-country, I am told it does
not produce enough for the con&s;umption of
its inhabitants, who are obliged to have an|nual
&s;upplies from abroad, imported at Mar|&s;eilles.
A Frenchman, at an average, eats
three times the quantity of bread that &s;atisfies
a native of England, and indeed it is, un|doubtedly
the &s;taff of his life. I am there|fore
&s;urprized that the Proven&ccedil;aux do not
convert part of their vineyards into corn|fields:
for they may boa&s;t of their wine as
they plea&s;e; but that which is drank by the
common people, not only here, but al&s;o in
all the wine countries of France, is neither &s;o
&s;trong, nouri&s;hing, nor (in my opinion) &s;o
plea&s;ant to the ta&s;te as the &s;mall-beer of
England. It mu&s;t be owned that all the pea|&s;ants
who have wine for their ordinary drink,
are of a diminutive &s;ize, in compari&s;on of
tho&s;e who u&s;e milk, beer, or even water;
and it is a con&s;tant ob&s;ervation, that when
there is a &s;carcity of wine, the common peo|ple
are always more healthy, than in tho&s;e
<PB N="231" REF="233">
&s;ea&s;ons when it abounds. The longer I live,
the more I am convinced that wine, and all
fermented liquors, are pernicious to the hu|man
con&s;titution; and that for the pre&s;erva|tion
of health, and exhileration of the &s;pirits,
there is no beverage comparable to &s;imple
water. Between Luc and Toulon, the coun|try
is delightfully parcelled out into inclo&s;ures.
Here is plenty of rich pa&s;turage for black cat|tle,
and a greater number of pure &s;treams and
rivulets than I have ob&s;erved in any other
parts of France.</P>
<P>Toulon is a con&s;iderable place, even exclu|&s;ive
of the ba&s;in, docks, and ar&s;enal, which
indeed are &s;uch as ju&s;tify the remark made
by a &s;tranger when he viewed them
&startq;The king of France (&s;aid he) is greater at
Toulon than at Ver&s;ailles.&endq; The quay, the
jetties, the docks, and magazines, are con|trived
and executed with preci&s;ion, order, &s;o|lidity,
and magnificence. I counted fourteen
&s;hips of the line lying unrigged in the ba&s;in,
be&s;ides the Tonant of eighty guns, which
was in dock repairing, and a new frigate on
the &s;tocks. I was credibly informed that in
the la&s;t war, the king of France was &s;o ill-&s;erved
<PB N="232" REF="234">
with cannon for his navy, that in every
action there was &s;carce a &s;hip which had not
&s;everal pieces bur&s;t. The&s;e accidents did great
damage, and di&s;couraged the French mariners
&s;o &s;uch a degree, that they became more afraid
of their own guns than of tho&s;e of the Engli&s;h.
There are now at Toulon above two thou|&s;and
pieces of iron cannon unfit for &s;ervice.
This is an undeniable proof of the weakne&s;s
and neglect of the French admini&s;tration:
but a more &s;urprizing proof of their im|becility,
is the &s;tate of the fortifications that
defend the entrance of this very harbour. I
have &s;ome rea&s;on to think that they tru&s;ted
for its &s;ecurity entirely to our opinion that
it mu&s;t be inacce&s;&s;ible. Capt. E&mdash;, of one
of our frigates, lately entered the harbour
with a contrary wind, which by obliging him
to tack, afforded an opportunity of &s;ounding
the whole breadth and length of the pa&s;&s;age.
He came in without a pilot, and made a pre|tence
of buying cordage, or &s;ome other &s;tores;
but the French officers were much chagrined
at the boldne&s;s of his enterprize. They al|ledged
that he came for no other rea&s;on but
to found the channel; and that he had an
<PB N="233" REF="235">
engineer aboard, who made drawings of the
land and the $orts, their bearings and di&s;tances.
In all probability, the&s;e &s;u&s;picions were com|municated
to the mini&s;try; for an order
immediately arrived, that no &s;tranger &s;hould
be admitted into the docks and ar&s;enal.</P>
<P>Part of the road from hence to Mar&s;eilles
lies through a va&s;t mountain, which re&s;em|bles
that of E&s;trelles; but is not &s;o well co|vered
with wood, though it has the advan|tage
of an agreeable &s;tream running through
the bottom.</P>
<P>I was much plea&s;ed with Mar&s;eilles, which
is indeed a noble city, large, populous, and
flouri&s;hing. The &s;treets, for the mo&s;t part,
are open, airy, and &s;pacious; the hou&s;es well
built, and even magnificent. The harbour is
an oval ba&s;in, &s;urrounded on every &s;ide either
by the buildings or the land, &s;o that the
&s;hipping lies perfectly &s;ecure; and here is
generally an incredible number of ve&s;&s;els.
On the city &s;ide, there is a &s;emi-circular quay
of free-&s;tone, which extends thirteen hundred
paces; and the &s;pace between this and the
hou&s;es that front it, is continually filled with
a &s;urpri&s;ing croud of people. The gallies,
<PB N="234" REF="236">
to the number of eight or nine, are $word$
with their &s;terns to one part of the $word$,
and the &s;laves are permitted to work for their
own benefit at their re&s;pective occupations, in
little &s;hops or booths, which they rent for a
trifle. There you &s;ee trade&s;men of all kinds
&s;itting at work, chained by one foot, &s;hoe|makers,
taylors, &s;ilver&s;miths, watch and clock|makers,
barbers, &s;tocking-weavers, jewellers,
pattern-drawers, &s;criveners, book&s;ellers, cut|lers,
and all manner of &s;hop-keepers. They
pay about two &s;ols a day to the king for this
indulgence; live well and look jolly; and
can afford to &s;ell their goods and labour much
cheaper than other dealers and trade&s;men.
At night, however, they are obliged to lie
aboard. Notwith&s;tanding the great face of
bu&s;ine&s;s at Mar&s;eilles, their trade is greatly
on the decline; and their merchants are fail|ing
every day. This decay of commerce is
in a great mea&s;ure owing to the Engli&s;h,
who, at the peace, poured in &s;uch a quantity
of European merchandize into Martinique
and Guadalupe, that when the merchants of
Mar&s;eilles &s;ent over their cargoes, they found
the markets over&s;tocked, and were obliged
<PB N="235" REF="237">
to &s;ell for a con&s;iderable lo&s;s. Be&s;ides, the
French coloni&s;ts had &s;uch a &s;tock of &s;ugars,
coffee, and other commodities lying by them
during the war, that upon the fir&s;t notice of
peace, they &s;hipped them off in great quan|tities
for Mar&s;eilles. I am told that the pro|duce
of the i&s;lands is at pre&s;ent cheaper here
than where it grows; and on the other hand
the merchandize of this country &s;ells for le&s;s
money at Martinique than in Provence.</P>
<P>A &s;ingle per&s;on, who travels in this coun|try,
may live at a rea&s;onable rate in the&s;e
towns, by eating at the public ordinaries:
but I would advi&s;e all families that come hi|ther
to make any &s;tay, to take furni&s;hed
lodgings as &s;oon as they can: for the expence
of living at an hotel is enormous. I was
obliged to pay at Mar&s;eilles four livres a head
for every meal, and half that price for my &s;er|vant,
and was charged &s;ix livres a day be&s;ides
for the apartment; &s;o that our daily expence,
including breakfa&s;t and a valet de place, a|mounted
to two loui$dores. The &s;ame im|po&s;ition
prevails all over the &s;outh of France,
though it is the cheape&s;t and mo&s;t plentiful
part of the kingdom. Without all doubt, it
<PB N="236" REF="238">
mu&s;t be owing to the folly and extravagance
of Engli&s;h travellers, who have allowed them|&s;elves
to be fleeced without wincing, until
this extortion is become authorized by cu&s;tom.
It is very di&s;agreeable riding in the avenues of
Marseilles, becau&s;e you are confined in a du&s;ty
high road, crouded with carriages and bea&s;ts
of burden, between two white walls, the re|flection
from which, while the &s;un &s;hines,
is intolerable. But in this neighbourhood
there is a va&s;t number of plea&s;ant country-hou&s;es,
called Ba&s;tides, &s;aid to amount to
twelve thou&s;and, &s;ome of which may be
rented ready furni&s;hed at a very rea&s;onable
price. Mar&s;eilles is a gay city, and the in|habitants
indulge them&s;elves in a variety of
amu&s;ements. They have a&s;&s;emblies, a concert
&s;pirituel, and a comedy. Here is al&s;o a &s;pa|cious
cours, or walk &s;haded with trees, to
which in the evening there is a great re&s;ort
of well-dre&s;&s;ed people.</P>
<P>Mar&s;eilles being a free port, there is a
bureau about half a league from the city on
the road to Aix, where all carriages undergo
examination; and if any thing contraband is
found, the vehicle, baggage, and even the
<PB N="237" REF="239">
hor&s;es are confi&s;cated. We e&s;caped this di&s;|agreeable
ceremony by the &s;agacity of our
driver. Of his own accord, he declared at
the bureau, that we had bought a pound of
coffee and &s;ome &s;ugar at Mar&s;eilles, and were
ready to pay the duty, which amounted to a|bout
ten &s;ols. They took the money, gave
him a receipt, and let the carriage pa&s;s, with|out
further que&s;tion.</P>
<P>I propo&s;ed to &s;tay one night only at Aix:
but Mr. A&mdash;r, who is here, had found &s;uch
benefit from drinking the waters, that I was
per&s;uaded to make trial of them for eight or
ten days. I have accordingly taken private
lodgings, and drank them every morning at
the fountain-head, not without finding con|&s;iderable
benefit. In my next I &s;hall &s;ay
&s;omething further of the&s;e waters, though I
am afraid they will not prove a &s;ource of much
entertainment. It will be &s;ufficient for me
to find them contribute in any degree to the
health of</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XL.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Boulgne, <DATE>May 23, 1765,</DATE></DATELINE>
DEAR DOCTOR,</OPENER>
<P>I Found three Engli&s;h families at Aix, with
whom I could have pa&s;&s;ed my time very
agreeably; but the &s;ociety is now di&s;&s;olved.
Mr. S&mdash;re and his lady left the place in a
few days after we arrived. Mr. A&mdash;r and
lady Betty are gone to Geneva; and Mr.
G&mdash;r with his family remains at Aix. This
gentleman, who laboured under a mo&s;t dread|ful
nervous a&s;thma, has obtained &s;uch relief
from this climate, that he intends to &s;tay ano|ther
year in the place: and Mr. A&mdash;r found
&s;urprizing benefit from drinking the waters,
for a &s;corbutical complaint. As I was in|commoded
by both the&s;e di&s;orders, I could
not but in ju&s;tice to my&s;elf, try the united
efforts of the air and the waters; e&s;pecially
as this con&s;ideration was re-inforced by the
kind and pre&s;&s;ing exhortations of Mr. A&mdash;$
<PB N="239" REF="241">
and lady Betty, which I could not in grati|tude
re&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>Aix, the capital of Provence, is a large
city, watered by the &s;mall river Are. It was
a Roman colony, &s;aid to be founded by Ca|ius
Sextus Calvinus, above a century before
the birth of Chri&s;t. From the &s;ource of mi|neral
water here found, added to the con&s;ul's
name, it was called Aquae Sextiae. It was
here that Marius, the conqueror of the Teu|tones,
fixed his head-quarters, and embel|li&s;heed
the place with temples, aqueducts,
and thermae, of which, however, nothing
now remains. The city, as it now &s;tands,
is well built, though the &s;treets in general
are narrow, and kept in a very dirty condi|tion.
But it has a noble <HI>cours</HI> planted with
double rows of tall trees, and adorned with
three or four fine fountains, the middlemo&s;t
of which di&s;charges hot water &s;upplied from
the &s;ource of the baths. On each &s;ide there
is a row of elegant hou&s;es, inhabited chiefly
by the noble&s;&s;e, of which there is here a con|&s;iderable
number. The parliament, which is
held at Aix, brings hither a great re&s;ort of
people; and as many of the inhabitants are
<PB N="240" REF="242">
per&s;ons of fa&s;hion, they are well bred, gay,
and &s;ociable. The duc de Villars, who is
governor of the province, re&s;ides on the &s;pot,
and keeps an open a&s;&s;embly, where &s;trangers
are admitted without re&s;erve, and made very
welcome, if they will engage in play, which
is the &s;ole occupation of the whole company.
Some of our Engli&s;h people complain, that
when they were pre&s;ented to him, they met
with a very cold reception. The French, as
well as other foreigners, have no idea of a
man of family and fa&s;hion, without the title
of duke, count, marquis, or lord, and where

<P>Aix is &s;ituated in a bottom, almo&s;t &s;ur|rounded
by hills, which, however do not
&s;creen it from the Bize, or north wind, that
blows extremely &s;harp in the winter and
&s;pring, rendering the air almo&s;t in&s;upportably
cold, and very dangerous to tho&s;e who have
&s;ome kinds of pulmonary complaints, &s;uch
as tubercules, ab&s;ce&s;&s;es, or &s;pitting of blood.
Lord H&mdash;, who pa&s;&s;ed part of la&s;t winter
<PB N="241" REF="243">
in this place, afflicted with &s;ome of the&s;e
&s;ymptoms, grew wor&s;e every day while he
continued at Aix: but, he no &s;ooner re|moved
to Mar&s;eilles, than all his complaints
abated; &s;uch a difference there is in the air
of the&s;e two places, though the di&s;tance be|tween
them does not exceed ten or twelve
miles. But the air of Mar&s;eilles, though
much more mild than that of Aix in the
winter, is not near &s;o warm as the climate of
Nice, where we find in plenty &s;uch flowers,
fruit, and vegetables, even in the &s;evere&s;t &s;ea|&s;on,
as will not grow and ripen, either at
Mar&s;eilles or Toulon.</P>
<P>If the air of Aix is di&s;agreeably cold in
the winter, it is rendered quite in&s;ufferable in
the &s;ummer, from exce&s;&s;ive heat, occa&s;ioned
by the reflexion from the rocks and moun|tains,
which at the &s;ame time ob&s;truct the
circulation of air: for it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved,
that the &s;ame mountains which &s;erve as fun|nels
and canals, to collect and di&s;charge the
keen bla&s;ts of winter, will provide &s;creens to
incercept intirely the faint breezes of &s;ummer.
Aix, though pretty well provided with butch|er's
meat, is very ill &s;upplied with pot-herbs;
<PB N="242" REF="244">
and they have no poultry but what comes at
a va&s;t di&s;tance from the Lionnois. They &s;ay
their want of roots, cabbage, cauliflower, &amp;c.
is owing to a &s;carcity of water: but the
truth is, they are very bad gardeners. Their
oil is good and cheap: their wine is indiffe|rent:
but their chief care &s;eems employed on
the culture of &s;ilk, the &s;taple of Provence,
which is every where &s;haded with plantations
of mulberry trees, for the nouri&s;hment of the
worms. Notwith&s;tanding the boa&s;ted cheap|ne&s;s
of every article of hou&s;ekeeping, in the
&s;outh of France, I am per&s;uaded a family may
live for le&s;s money at York, Durham, Here|ford,
and in many other cities of England
than at Aix in Provence; keep a more plen|tiful
table; and be much more comfortably
&s;ituated in all re&s;pects. I found lodging and
provi&s;ion at Aix fifty per cent, dearer than at
Montpellier, which is counted the deare&s;t
place in Languedoc.</P>
<P>The baths of Aix, &s;o famous in antiquity,
were quite demoli&s;hed by the irruptions of,
the Barbarians. The very &s;ource of the
water was lo&s;t, till the beginning of the pre|&s;ent
century, (I think the year 1704) when it
<PB N="243" REF="245">
was di&s;covered by accident, in digging for the
foundation of a hou&s;e, at the foot of a
hill, ju&s;t without the city wall. Near the
&s;ame place was found a &s;mall &s;tone altar,
with the figure of a Priapus, arid &s;ome letters
in capitals, which the antiquarians have dif|ferently
interpreted. From this figure, it
was &s;uppo&s;ed that the waters were efficacious
in ca&s;es of barrenne&s;s. It was a long time,
however, before any per&s;on would venture to
u&s;e them internally, as it did not appear
that they had ever been drank by the anti|ents.
On their re-appearance, they were
chiefly u&s;ed for baths to hor&s;es, and other
bea&s;ts; which had the mange, and other cuta|neous
eruptions. At length poor people be|gan
to bathe in them for the &s;ame di&s;orders,
and received &s;uch benefit from them, as at|tracted
the attention of more curious inqui|rers.
A very &s;uperficial and imperfect: ana|ly&s;is
was made and publi&s;hed, with a few
remarkable hi&s;tories of the cures they had
performed, by three different phy&s;icians of
tho&s;e days; and tho&s;e little treati&s;es, I &s;up|po&s;e,
encouraged valetudinarians to drink
them without ceremony. They were found
<PB N="244" REF="246">
&s;erviceable in the gout, the gravel, &s;curvy,
drop&s;y, pal&s;y, indige&s;tion, a&s;thma, and con|&s;umption;
and their fame &s;oon extended it&s;elf
all over Languedoc, Ga&s;cony, Dauphin&eacute;, and
Provence. The magi&s;trates, with a view to
render them more u&s;eful and commodious,
have rai&s;ed a plain building, in which there
are a couple of private baths, with a bed|chamber
adjoining to each, where individuals
may u&s;e them both internally and exter|nally,
for a moderate expence. The&s;e baths
are paved with marble, and &s;upplied with
water each by a large bra&s;s cock, which
you can turn at plea&s;ure. At one end of
this edifice, there is an octagon, open at top,
having a ba&s;on, with a &s;tone pillar in the
middle, which di&s;charges water from the
&s;ame &s;ource, all round, by eight &s;mall bra&s;s
cocks; and hither people of all ranks come
of a morning, with their gla&s;&s;es, to drink
the water, or wa&s;h their &s;ores, or &s;ubject
their contracted limbs to the &s;tream. This
la&s;t operation, called the <HI>douche,</HI> how|ever,
is more effectually undergone in the
private bath, where the &s;tream is much more
powerful. The natural warmth of this
<PB N="245" REF="247">
water, as nearly as I can judge from recol|lection,
is about the &s;ame degree of tempe|rature
with that in the Queen's Bath, at
Bath in Somer&s;et&s;hire. It is perfectly tran&s;|parent,
&s;parkling in the gla&s;s, light and agree|able
to the ta&s;te, and may be drank without
any preparation, to the quantity of three or
four pints at a time. There are many peo|ple
at Aix who &s;wallow fourteen half pint
gla&s;&s;es every morning, during the &s;ea&s;on,
which is in the month of May, though it
may be taken with equal benefit all the year
round. It has no &s;en&s;ible operation but by
urine, an effect which pure water would
produce, if drank in the &s;ame quantity.</P>
<P>If we may believe tho&s;e who have pub|li&s;hed
their experiments, this water produces
neither agitation, cloud, or change of colour,
when mixed with acids, alkalies, tincture of
galls, &s;yrup of violets, or &s;olution of &s;ilver.
The re&s;idue, after boiling, evaporation, and
filtration, affords a very &s;mall proportion of
purging falt, and calcarious earth, which la&s;t
ferments with &s;trong acids. As I had neither
hydrometer nor thermometer to a&s;certain the
$$ight and warmth of this water; nor time
<PB N="246" REF="248">
to procure the proper uten&s;ils, to make the
preparations, and repeat the experiments ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to exhibit a complete analy&s;is, I did
not pretend to enter upon this proce&s;s; but
contented my&s;elf with drinking, bathing, and
u&s;ing the <HI>douche,</HI> which perfectly an&s;wered
my expectation, ha$ing, in eight days, almo&s;t
cured an ugly &s;corbutic tetter, which had
for &s;ome time deprived me of the u&s;e of my
right hand. I ob&s;erved that the water, when
u&s;ed externally, left always a kind of oily
appearance on the &s;kin: that when we boil|ed
it at home, in an earthen pot, the &s;teams
&s;melled like tho&s;e of &s;ulphur, and even af|fected
my lungs in the &s;ame manner: but
the bath it&s;elf &s;melled &s;trong of a lime-kiln.
The water, after &s;tanding all night in a
bottle, yielded a remarkably vinous ta&s;te and
odour, &s;omething analogous to that of dul|cified
&s;pirit of nitre. Whether the active
particles con&s;i&s;t of a volatile vitriol, or a very
fine petroleum, or a mixture of both, I &s;hall
not pretend to determine: but the be&s;t way I
know of di&s;covering whether it is really im|pregnated
with a vitriolic principle, too &s;ub|til
and fugitive, for the. u&s;ual operations of
<PB N="247" REF="249">
chymi&s;try, is to place bottles, filled with wine,
in the bath, or adjacent room, which wine,
if there is really a volatile acid, in any con&s;i|derable
quantity, will be pricked in eight and
forty hours.</P>
<P>Having ordered our coach to be refitted,
and provided with fre&s;h hor&s;es, as well as
with another po&s;tilion, in con&s;equence of
which improvements, I payed at the rate of
a loui'dore <HI>per diem</HI> to Lyons and back again,
we departed from Aix, and the &s;econd day of
our journey pa&s;&s;ing the Durance in a boat,
lay at Avignon. This river, the Druentia of
the antients, is a con&s;iderable &s;tream, ex|tremely
rapid, which de&s;cends from the moun|tains,
and di&s;charges it&s;elf in the Rhone.
After violent rains it extends its channel, &s;o as
to be impa&s;&s;ible, and often overflows the
country to a great extent. In the middle of
a plain, betwixt Orgon and this river, we
met the coach in which we had travelled
eighteen months before, from Lyons to
Montpellier, conducted by our old driver
Jo&s;eph, who no &s;ooner recognized my
&s;ervant at a di&s;tance, by his mu&s;que|toon,
than he came running towards
<PB N="248" REF="250">
our carriage, and &s;eizing my hand, even
&s;hed tears of joy. Jo&s;eph had been tra|velling
through Spain, and was &s;o im|browned
by the &s;un, that he might have
pa&s;&s;ed for an Iroquois. I was much plea&s;ed
with the marks of gratitude which the poor
fellow expre&s;&s;ed towards his benefactors. He
had &s;ome private conver&s;ation with our <HI>voitu|rier,</HI>
who&s;e name was Claude, to whom he
gave &s;uch a favourable character of us, as in
all probablity induced him to be wonderfully
obliging during the whole journey.</P>
<P>You know Avignon is a large city be|longing
to the pope. It was the <HI>Avenio
Cavarum</HI> of the antients, and changed
ma&s;ters &s;everal times, belonging &s;ucce&s;&s;ively
to the Romans, Burgundians, Franks, the
kingdom of Arles, the counts of Provence,
and the &s;overeigns of Naples. It was &s;old in
the fourteenth century, by queen Jane I. of
Naples, to pope Clement VI. for the &s;um of
eighty thou&s;and florins, and &s;ince that period
has continued under the dominion of the &s;ee of
Rome. Not but that when the duc de Cre|qui,
the French amba&s;&s;ador, was in&s;ulted at
Rome in the year 1662, the parliament of
<PB N="249" REF="251">
Provence pa&s;&s;ed an arret, declaring the city of
Avignon, and the county Venai&s;&s;in, part of the
ancient domain of Provence; and therefore
reunited it to the crown of France, which
accordingly took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; though it was
afterwards re&s;tored to the Roman &s;ee at the
peace of Pi&s;a. The pope, however, holds it
by a precarious title, at the mercy of the
French king, who may one day be induced
to re&s;ume it, upon payment of the original
purcha&s;e-money. As a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of popes
re&s;ided here for the &s;pace of &s;eventy years,
the city could not fail to be adorned with a
great number of magnificent churches and
convents, which are richly embelli&s;hed with
painting, &s;culpture, &s;hrines, reliques, and
tombs. Among the la&s;t, is that of the cele|brated
Laura, whom Petrarch has immorta|lized
by his poetry, and for whom Francis I.
of France took the trouble to write an epi|taph.
Avignon is governed by a vice-legate
from the pope, and the police of the city is
regulated by the con&s;uls. It is a large place,
&s;ituated in a fruitful plain, &s;urrounded by
high walls built of hewn &s;tone, which on the
we&s;t &s;ide are wa&s;hed by the Rhone. Here
<PB N="250" REF="252">
was a noble bridge over the river, but it is
now in ruins. On the other &s;ide, a branch of
the Sorgue runs through part of the city.
This is the river anciently called Sulga,
formed by the famous Fountain of Vauclu&s;e
in this neighbourhood, where the poet Pe|trarch
re&s;ided. It is a charming tran&s;parent
&s;tream, abounding with excellent trout and
craw-fi&s;h. We pa&s;&s;ed over it on a &s;tone
bridge, in our way to Orange, the <HI>Arau&s;io
Cavarum</HI> of the Romans, &s;till di&s;tingui&s;hed
by &s;ome noble monuments of antiquity.
The&s;e con&s;i&s;t of a circus, an aqueduct, a
temple, and a triumphal arch, which la&s;t was
erected in honour of Caius Marius, and Luc|tatius
Catulus, after the great victory they
obtained in this country over the Cimbri and
Teutones. It is a very magnificent edifice,
adorned on all &s;ides with trophies and bat|tles
in ba&s;&s;o relievo. The ornaments of the
architecture, and the &s;culpture, are wonder|fully
elegant for the time in which it was
erected; and the whole is &s;urpri&s;ingly well
pre&s;erved, con&s;idering its great antiquity. It
&s;eems to me to be as entire and perfect as the
arch of Septimius Severus at Rome. Next
<PB N="251" REF="253">
day we pa&s;&s;ed two very impetuous &s;treams,
the Drome and the I&s;ere. The fir&s;t, which
very much re&s;embles the Var, we forded: but
the I&s;ere we cro&s;&s;ed in a boat, which as well
as that upon the Durance, is managed by the
traille, a moveable or running pulley, on a
rope &s;tretched between two wooden machines
erected on the oppo&s;ite &s;ides of the river.
The contrivance is &s;imple and effectual, and
the pa&s;&s;age equally &s;afe and expeditious. The
boatman has nothing to do, but by means
of a long ma&s;&s;y rudder, to keep the
head obliquely to the &s;tream, the force of
which pu&s;hes the boat along, the block to
which it is fixed &s;liding upon the rope from
one &s;ide to the other. All the&s;e rivers take
their ri&s;e from the mountains, which are con|tinued
through Provence and Dauphin&eacute;, and
fall into the Rhone: and all of them, when
&s;welled by &s;udden rains, overflow the flat
country. Although Dauphin&eacute; affords little
or no oil, it produces excellent wines, parti|cularly
tho&s;e of Hermitage and Cote-roti.
The fir&s;t of the&s;e is &s;old on the &s;pot for
three livres the bottle, and the other for two.
The country likewi&s;e yields a con&s;iderable
<PB N="252" REF="254">
quantity of corn, and a good deal of gra&s;s.
It is well watered with &s;treams, and agree|ably
&s;haded with wood. The weather was
plea&s;ant, and we had a continued &s;ong of
nightingales from Aix to Fountainbleau.</P>
<P>I cannot pretend to &s;pecify the antiquities
of Vienne, antiently called Vienna Allobro|gum.
It was a Roman colony, and a con&s;i|derable
city, which the antients &s;pared no
pains and expence to embelli&s;h. It is &s;till a
large town, &s;tanding among &s;everal hills on
the banks of the Rhone, though all its for|mer
&s;plendor is eclip&s;ed, its commerce decayed,
and mo&s;t of its antiquities are buried in ruins.
The church of Notre Dame de la Vie was
undoubtedly a temple. On the left of the
road, as you enter it, by the gate of Avignon,
there is a hand&s;ome obeli&s;k, or rather pyra|mid,
about thirty feet high, rai&s;ed upon a
vault &s;upported by four pillars of the Tu&s;can
order. It is certainly a Roman work, and
Montfaucon &s;uppo&s;es it to be a tomb, as he
perceived an oblong &s;tone jetting out from the
middle of the vault, in which the a&s;hes of
the defunct were probably contained. The
&s;tory of Pontius Pilate, who is &s;aid to have
<PB N="253" REF="255">
ended his days in this place, is a fable. On
the &s;eventh day of our journey from Aix, we
arrived at Lyons, where I &s;hall take my leave
of you for the pre&s;ent, being with great
truth,</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am at la&s;t in a &s;ituation to indulge my
view with a &s;ight of Britain, after an
ab&s;ence of two years; and indeed you cannot
imagine what plea&s;ure I feel while I &s;urvey
the white cliffs of Dover, at this di&s;tance.
Not that I am at all affected by the <HI>ne&s;cia qua
dulcedine natalis &s;oli,</HI> of Horace. That &s;eems
to be a kind of fanatici&s;m founded on the
prejudices of education, which induces a Lap|lander
to place the terre&s;trial paradi&s;e among
the &s;nows of Norway, and a Swi&s;s to pre|fer
the barren mountains of Solleure to the
<PB N="254" REF="256">
fruitful plains of Lombardy. I am attached
to my country, becau&s;e it is the land of li|berty,
cleanline&s;s, and convenience: but I
love it &s;till more tenderly, as the &s;cence of all
my intere&s;ting connexions; as the habitation
of my friends, for who&s;e conver&s;ation, cor|re&s;pondence,
and e&s;teem, I wi&s;h alone to
live.</P>
<P>Our Journey hither from Lyons produced
neither accident nor adventure worth notice;
but abundance of little vexations, which may
be termed the Plagues of Po&s;ting. At Lyons,
where we &s;tayed only a few days, I found a
return-coach, which I hired to Paris for &s;ix
loui'dores. It was a fine roomy carriage,
elegantly furni&s;hed, and made for travelling
&s;o &s;trong and &s;olid in all its parts, that there
was no danger of its being &s;haken to pieces
by the roughne&s;s of the road: but its weight
and &s;olidity occa&s;ioned &s;o much friction be|tween
the wheels and the axle-tree, that we
ran the ri&s;que of being &s;et on fire three or
four times a day. Upon a ju&s;t compari&s;on
of all circum&s;tances, po&s;ting is much more
ea&s;y, convenient, and rea&s;onable in England
than in France. The Engli&s;h carriages,
<PB N="255" REF="257">
hor&s;es, harne&s;s, and roads are much better;
and the po&s;tilions more obliging and alert.
The rea&s;on is plain and obvious. If I am
ill-u&s;ed at the po&s;t-hou&s;e in England, I can
be accommodated el&s;ewhere. The publicans
on the road are &s;en&s;ible of this, and there|fore
they vie with each other in giving &s;atis|faction
to travellers. But in France, where
the po&s;t is monopolized, the po&s;t-ma&s;ters and
po&s;tilions, knowing that the traveller depends
intirely upon them, are the more negligent
and remi&s;s in their duty, as well as the more
encouraged to in&s;olence and impo&s;ition. In|deed
the &s;tranger &s;eems to be left intirely at
the mercy of tho&s;e fellows, except in large
towns, where he may have recour&s;e to the
magi&s;trate or commanding officer. The
po&s;t &s;tands very often by it&s;elf in a lone
country &s;ituation, or in a paultry village,
where the po&s;t-ma&s;ter is the principal inha|bitant;
and in &s;uch a ca&s;e, if you &s;hould be
ill-treated, by being &s;upplied with bad hor&s;es;
if you &s;hould be delayed on frivolous pre|tences,
in order to extort money; if the
po&s;tilions &s;hould drive at a waggon pace, with
a view to provoke your impatience; or &s;hould
<PB N="256" REF="258">
you in any &s;hape be in&s;ulted by them or their
ma&s;ters; I know not any redre&s;s you can
have, except by a formal complaint to the
comptroller of the po&s;ts, who is generally
one of the mini&s;ters of &s;tate, and pays little
or no regard to any &s;uch repre&s;entations. I
know an Engli&s;h gentleman, the brother of
an earl, who wrote a letter of complaint to
the Duc de Villars, governor of Provence,
again&s;t the po&s;t-ma&s;ter of Antibes, who had
in&s;ulted and impo&s;ed upon him. The duke
an&s;wered his letter, promi&s;ing to take order
that the grievance &s;hould be redre&s;&s;ed; and
never thought of it after. Another great in|convenience
which attends po&s;ting in France,
is that if you are retarded by any accident,
you cannot in many parts of the kingdom
find a lodging, without perhaps travelling two
or three po&s;ts farther than you would choo&s;e
to go, to the prejudice of your health, and
even the hazard of your life; whereas, on
any part of the po&s;t-road in England, you
will meet with tolerable accommodation at
every &s;tage. Through the whole &s;outh of
France, except in large cities, the inns are
cold, damp, dark, di&s;mal, and dirty; the
<PB N="257" REF="259">
landlords equally di&s;obliging and rapacious;
the &s;ervants aukward, &s;lutti&s;h, and &s;lothful;
and the po&s;tilions lazy, lounging, greedy, and
impertinent. If you chide them far lingering,
they will continue to delay you the longer:
if you cha&s;ti&s;e them with &s;word, cane, cudgel,
or hor&s;e-whip, they will either di&s;appear en|tirely,
and leave you without re&s;ource; or
they will find means to take vengeance by
overturning your carriage. The be&s;t me|thod
I know of travelling with any degree
of comfort, is to allow your&s;elf to become
the dupe of impo&s;ition, and &s;timulate their
endeavours by extraordinary gratifications.
I laid down a re&s;olution (and kept it) to give
no more than four and twenty &s;ols per po&s;t
between the two po&s;tilions; but I am now
per&s;uaded that for three-pence a po&s;t more, I
&s;hould have been much better &s;erved, and
&s;hould have performed the journey with
much greater plea&s;ure. We met with no
adventures upon the road worth reciting.
The fir&s;t day we were retarded above two
hours by the dutche&s;s D&mdash;lle, and her &s;on
the duc de R&mdash;f&mdash;t, who by virtue of an
<PB N="258" REF="260">
order from the mini&s;ter, had anticipated
all the hor&s;es at the po&s;t. They acco&s;ted my
&s;ervant, and a&s;ked if his ma&s;ter was a lord?
He thought proper to an&s;wer in the affirma|tive;
upon which the duke declared that
he mu&s;t certainly be of French extraction,
ina&s;much as he ob&s;erved the lillies of France
in his arms on the coach. This young
nobleman &s;poke a little Engli&s;h. He a&s;ked
whence we had come; and under&s;tanding
we had been in Italy, de&s;ired to know whe|ther
the man liked France or Italy be&s;t? Upon
his giving France the preference, he clapped
him on the &s;houlder, and &s;aid he was a lad
of good ta&s;te. The dutche&s;s a&s;ked if her
&s;on &s;poke Engli&s;h well, and &s;eemed mightily
plea&s;ed when my man a&s;&s;ured her he did.
They were much more free and conde&s;cend|ing
with my &s;ervant than with my&s;elf; for,
though we &s;aluted them in pa&s;&s;ing, and were
even &s;uppo&s;ed to be per&s;ons of quality, they
did not open their lips, while we &s;tood clo&s;e
by them at the inn-door, till their hor&s;es
were changed. They were going to Geneva;
and their equipage con&s;i&s;ted of three coaches
<PB N="259" REF="261">
and &s;ix, with five dome&s;tics a hor&s;eback.
The dutche&s;s was a tall, thin, raw-boned
woman, with her head clo&s;e &s;haved. This
delay obliged us to lie two po&s;ts &s;hort of
Macon, at a &s;olitary auberge called Mai&s;on
Blanche, which had nothing white about it,
but the name. The Lionnois is one of the
mo&s;t agreeable and be&s;t cultivated countries I
ever beheld, diver&s;ified with hill, dale, wood,
and water, laid out in exten&s;ive corn-fields
and rich meadows, well &s;tocked with black
cattle; and adorned with a &s;urpri&s;ing number
of towns, villages, villas, and convents,
generally &s;ituated on the brows of gently
&s;welling hills, &s;o that they appear to the
greate&s;t advantage. What contributes in a
great mea&s;ure to the beauty of this, and the
Maconnois, is the charming pa&s;toral Soame,
which from the city of Chalons winds it
&s;ilent cour&s;e &s;o &s;mooth and gentle, that one
can &s;carce di&s;cern which way its current flows.
It is this placid appearance that tempts &s;o
many people to bathe in it at Lions, where
a good number of individuals are drowned
every &s;ummer: whereas there is no in&s;tance
<PB N="260" REF="262">
of any per&s;ons thus peri&s;hing in the Rhone,
the rapidity of it deterring every body from
bathing in its &s;tream. Next night we pa&s;&s;ed
at Beaune, where we found nothing good
but the wine, for which we paid forty &s;ols
the bottle. At Chalons our axle-tree took
fire; an accident which detained us &s;o long,
that it was ten before we arrived at Auxerre,
where we lay. In all probability we mu&s;t
have lodged in the coach, had not we been
content to take four hor&s;es, and pay for &s;ix,
two po&s;ts &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. The alternative was,
either to proceed with four on tho&s;e terms, or
&s;tay till the other hor&s;es &s;hould come in and
be refre&s;hed. In &s;uch an emergency, I
would advi&s;e the traveller to put up with the
four, and he will find the po&s;tilions &s;o much
upon their mettle, that tho&s;e &s;tages will be
performed &s;ooner than the others in which
you have the full complement.</P>
<P>There was an Engli&s;h gentleman laid up at
Auxerre with a broken arm, to whom I &s;ent
my compliments, with offers of &s;ervice; but
his &s;ervant told my man that he did not choo&s;e
to &s;ee any company, and had no occa&s;ion for
<PB N="261" REF="263">
my &s;ervice. This &s;ort of re&s;erve &s;eems pecu|liar
to the Engli&s;h di&s;po&s;ition. When two
natives of any other country chance to meet
abroad, they run into each other's embrace
like old friends, even though they have never
heard of one another till that moment;
whereas two Engli&s;hmen in the &s;ame &s;itua|tion
maintain a mutual re&s;erve and diffi|dence,
and keep without the &s;phere of each
other's attraction, like two bodies endowed
with a repul&s;ive power. We only &s;topped to
change hor&s;es at Dijon, the capital of Bur|gundy,
which is a venerable old city; but
we pa&s;&s;ed part of a day at Sens, and vi&s;ited
a manufacture of that &s;tuff we call Man|che&s;ter
velvet, which is here made and dyed
to great perfection, under the direction of
Engli&s;h workmen, who have been &s;educed
from their own country. At Fontainbleau,
we went to &s;ee the palace, or, as it is called,
the ca&s;tle, which though an irregular pile
of building, affords a great deal of lodging,
and contains &s;ome very noble apartments,
particularly the hall of audience, with the
king's and queen's chambers, upon which
<PB N="262" REF="264">
the ornaments of carving and gilding are
lavi&s;hed with profu&s;ion rather than propriety.
Here are &s;ome rich parterres of flower-garden,
and a noble orangerie, which how|ever
we did not greatly admire, after having
lived among the natural orange groves of
Italy. Hitherto we had enjoyed fine &s;um|mer
weather, and I found my&s;elf &s;o well,
that I imagined my health was interely re|&s;tored:
but betwixt Fontainebleau and Paris,
we were overtaken by a black &s;torm of rain,
&s;leet, and hail, which &s;eemed to rein&s;tate
winter in all its rigour; for the cold wea|ther
continues to this day. There was no
re&s;i&s;ting this attack. I caught cold imme|diately;
and this was reinforced at Paris,
where I &s;tayed but three days. The &s;ame
man, (Pa&s;cal Sellier, r&uuml;e Guenegaud faux|bourg
St. Germain) who owned the coach
that brought us from Lyons, &s;upplied me with
a returned berline to Boulogne, for &s;ix loui'|dores,
and we came hither by ea&s;y journeys.
The fir&s;t night we lodged at Breteuil, where
we found an elegant inn, and very good
accommodation. But the next we were
<PB N="263" REF="265">
forced to take up our quarters, at the hou&s;e
where we had formerly pa&s;&s;ed a very di&s;|agreeable
night at Abbeville. I am now in
tolerable lodging, where I &s;hall remain a
few weeks, merely for the &s;ake of a little
repo&s;e; then I &s;hall gladly tempt that

THE town of Nice is &s;ituated in the bay
of Antibes, latitude forty-three degrees,
forty minutes north; ea&s;t longitude from London,
&s;even degrees, twenty-five minutes, aequidi&s;tant
from Mar&s;eilles, Genoa, and Turin, that is
about ninety Engli&s;h miles. The north wind
blows over the maritime Alps, at the feet of
which the town is &s;ituated; the &s;outh from
Cape Bona, on the coa&s;t of Barbary, &s;weeping
the i&s;lands of Sardinia and Cor&s;ica in its pa&s;&s;age:
the ea&s;t from the Riviera of Genoa; and the
we&s;t from Provence.</P>
<P>The town of Nice is wedged between a &s;teep
rock to the ea&s;tward, and the river Paglion,
which wa&s;hes the walls upon the we&s;t, and falls
into the Mediterranean, within thirty yards of
the corner ba&s;tion.</P>
<P>This river is but a &s;canty &s;tream, fed chiefly
by the melting of the &s;now upon the mountains.
It is &s;ometimes &s;welled to a great depth by
&s;udden torrents: but in the &s;ummer it is u&s;ually
dry.</P>
<P>The town of Nice is built of &s;tone, and the
&s;treets are narrow. It is &s;aid to contain twelve
thou&s;and inhabitants, in which ca&s;e they mu&s;t
be much crowded, for the place is but &s;mall.
There is a bridge of three arches over the
Paglion, which is the entrance from the &s;ide
<PB N="268" REF="269">
of Provence. Nice is &s;urrounded on this &s;ide
by a wall and rampart of no &s;trength: on the
other &s;ide, it is commanded by a high rock,
on which appear the ruins of an old ca&s;tle,
which was once deemed impregnable. It was
taken and di&s;mantled by Marechal Catinat,
in the reign of Victor Amadeus, father to the
pre&s;ent king of Sardinia. To the ea&s;tward of
this rock is the harbour of Nice, in which there
is not depth of water &s;ufficient for &s;hips of any
burthen. The hills begin to ri&s;e about a &s;hort
mile from the north gate of the town. The
Var falls into the &s;ea about four miles to the
we&s;t ward; and is fordable at the village of St.
Laurent, which &s;tands on the French &s;ide near
the mouth of the river. The &s;pace between
the Var and Nice is a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of agreeable
eminences, adorned with a great number of
white hou&s;es or ca&s;&s;ines, &s;urrounded by planta|tions
of olives, vines, oranges, lemons, and
citrons. The air of Nice is pure and penetrat|ing,
yet mild, generally dry, and ela&s;tic; and
the &s;ky is remarkably clear and &s;erene. The
well-water is mo&s;tly hard, but not unwhole|&s;ome;
and there are &s;ome &s;prings both in the
town and neighbourhood, which are &s;urpriz|ingly
cool, limpid, and agreeable.</P>
