<HEAD>THE
EARL OF DOUGLAS,
AN
ENGLISH STORY.</HEAD>
<P>HYPPOLITUS had no
power to interrupt the painter's
harangue; the emotions of his
&s;oul were &s;uch as &s;carce allowed
him to credit the truth of what
he heard. At length, with a
deep &s;igh, if your fidelity is to be
depended upon, &s;aid he to the
<PB N="2" REF="4">
painter, and you will engage to
do me a material piece of &s;er|vice,
you &s;hall have no rea&s;on
to repent your walk:&mdash;I am
grateful, and my fortune enables
me to reward my friends;&mdash;but I
mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t on the promi&s;e of in|violable
&s;ecre&s;y. The painter
concluding he would have him
to take a likene&s;s of &s;ome lady
at <HI>Bourbon,</HI> who had captivated
his heart, an&s;wered, not a day
pa&s;&s;ed without putting his fide|lity
to the proof! and no per&s;on
had ever rea&s;on to complain on
that article.&mdash;He a&s;&s;ured him
his conception was &s;o lively and
retentive, that only &s;eeing a face
once, he would engage to trace
every line in it;&mdash;or even &s;hould
that be impo&s;&s;ible, his imagina|tion
could catch the fatures by
de&s;cription, &s;o accurately as to
give a very &s;trong re&s;emblance!
<PB N="3" REF="5">
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> could not forbear &s;mi|ling
at the painter's opinion of
the extent of his genius. The
bu&s;ine&s;s in agitation, he replied,
has no relation to your &s;kill as
an arti&s;t, but to your inclination
to take me with you to St. <HI>Me|noux,</HI>
a difficulty that does not
appear in&s;urmountable, as I am
totally unknown there, and am
qualified from my knowledge in
de&s;ign to acquit my&s;elf without
any embara&s;ment. You have
only to &s;ay I am of <HI>Italy;</HI>&mdash;agree
to work for the abbe&s;s on her
own terms;&mdash;give your&s;elf no
farther trouble, but leave the re&s;t
to me.&mdash;The painter was unwil|ling
to refu&s;e an advantageous
propo&s;al that gratified his avarice
without any dangerous con&s;e|quences,
as far at lea&s;t as he could
perceive.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="6">
THE &s;cheme was no &s;ooner
planned than executed.&mdash;They
&s;et out in a coach for the abbey
that afternoon, as <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
could not yet bear the motion of
a hor&s;e. He left&punc; his &s;ervants at
<HI>Bourbon,</HI> and changed his cloaths
for a &s;uit no way remarkable, a&s;|&s;uming
the name of Signior <HI>Je|ronymo.</HI></P>
<P>No time was lo&s;t upon the
road;&mdash;he ordered the coach|man
to drive with all po&s;&s;ible
expedition.&mdash;<HI>Cupid</HI> was his po&s;|tillion,
who added wings to his
hor&s;es.&mdash;Yet <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> was
&s;eized with &s;uch a tremor when
they alighted, as rendered him
almo&s;t incapable of entering the
parlour&punc; where the abbe&s;s came
to &s;peak to the painter. She en|quired
who his companion was,
which was natural enough, for
<PB N="5" REF="7">
in&s;pite of the &s;tudied &s;implicity
of his dre&s;s and manners, there
was a gracefulne&s;s of mein,&mdash;
a &s;ymmetry of features,&mdash;with
the mo&s;t engaging expre&s;&s;ion of
countenance,&mdash;that at fir&s;t &s;ight
&s;truck every beholder with awe
and admiration.&mdash;The painter
coldly replied an <HI>Italian,</HI> who
was very fond of the art, and had
worked with him &s;ome time.&mdash;
The abbe&s;s told him &s;he had a
mind he &s;hould draw her pic|ture,
and would &s;it the next
day;&mdash;a&s;&s;uring him &s;he had
employment enough for them
both for a twelvemonth.</P>
<P>THERE required a communi|cation
&s;o agreeable to comfort
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> under the di&s;appoint|ment
of not &s;eeing <HI>Julia.</HI> He
ro&s;e the next morning before
day-break, and in&s;i&s;ted on
<PB N="6" REF="8">
the painter's doing the &s;ame;
&mdash;an impatience which did
not appear to him extraordi|nary,
as he was convinced
his patron had &s;ome very impor|tant
rea&s;ons for coming to St.
<HI>Menoux.</HI> The abbe&s;s had no
&s;ooner breakfa&s;ted than &s;he &s;ent
for them into the convent.&mdash;
The eyes of <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> &s;earched
in vain for <HI>Julia.</HI> His impetu|o&s;ity
tempted him to fly through
every appartment to find her, and
his heart &s;uffered the mo&s;t cruel
agitation from the nece&s;&s;ity he
was under of concealing it from
the eye of ob&s;ervation. He ever
feared the effect his unexpected
pre&s;ence might have on <HI>Julia,</HI>
and le&s;t her unguarded tran&s;ports
&s;hould betray the &s;ecret. When
they were retired into the cabi|net,
the abbe&s;s &s;eated her&s;elf in
the attitude &s;he thought mo&s;t be|coming;
<PB N="7" REF="9">
and <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> to give
him&s;elf the appearance of em|ployment,
began to grind and
mix the colours&mdash;It is true,
he performed this ta&s;k rather
aukwardly, for want of knowing
the exact rules; to &s;eem occu|pied
was &s;ufficient. Alas! how
did his thoughts wander! and
how tedious were the hours of
expectation! As the ceremony of
&s;itting to a painter has &s;omething
formally tedious in it, the abbe&s;s
began to loo&s;e that air of chear|fulne&s;s
which &s;he fancied e&s;&s;en|tial
to the beauty of her portrait.
I have heard, &s;aid &s;he, painters
generally abound in entertaining
anecdotes, and tales that relax
the features of the face they are
drawing. But you have not &s;aid
a word to divert my imagination,
and I feel my&s;elf growing horrid|ly
&s;erious, for want of &s;ome a|mu&s;ing
<PB N="8" REF="10">
recital: I am too much
engro&s;&s;ed, madam, &s;aid <HI>Cardini,</HI>
which was the name of the pain|ter,
with catching a plea&s;ing
likene&s;s, and expre&s;&s;ing it pro|perly,
to think of any &s;ubject of
amu&s;ement, nor indeed have I
liveline&s;s of fancy to &s;hine in
conver&s;ation, but here is <HI>Jero|nymo,</HI>
whom I keep purpo&s;ely to
divert the ladies with a thou&s;and
plea&s;ant narratives, that he is
furni&s;hed with, if you will give
him leave to addre&s;s you, I dare
&s;ay, madam, you will not repent
the conde&s;cen&s;ion. Begin <HI>Je|ronymo,</HI>
&s;aid the abbe&s;s, with an
encouraging look, &s;ince <HI>Cardini</HI>
appoints you his deputy. <HI>Hyp|politus</HI>
blu&s;hed at this malicious
turn of the painter's, and was &s;o
little di&s;po&s;ed for conver&s;ation,
that he could only an&s;wer with
he&s;itation and re&s;erve, he did not
<PB N="9" REF="11">
immediately recollect any thing
that wo$ld entertain her. The
abbe&s;s redoubled her entreaties in
a manner &s;o pre&s;&s;ing, he feared
to incur her di&s;plea&s;ure by an
ob&s;tinate &s;ilence, which might
bani&s;h him for ever from the
place that contained the dear ob|ject
of his vows. Exerting all
his pre&s;ence of mind, he endea|voured
to recollect the particulars
of a <HI>Fairy Tale</HI> he had &s;ome|where
read, and which he re|peated
in the mo&s;t graceful ac|cent.</P>
<P>RUSSIA is &s;ituated in a cli|mate
that excludes its inhabitants
from the free enjoyment of tho&s;e
delightful days common in tem|perate
regions. The mountains
are covered with perpepetual
&s;now, and the trees &s;o incru&s;ted
with icicles, that when the &s;un
<PB N="10" REF="12">
glitters on their tops, they ap|pear
to the eye immen&s;e fore&s;ts
of cry&s;tal. The roaring of bears
is &s;o horrible, and to hunt the&s;e
formidable animals is regarded
by the natives as the mo&s;t noble
and honourable occupation.&mdash;
This country was in former ages
governed by a young king, named
<HI>Adolphus,</HI> who&s;e happy natural
di&s;po&s;ition, beauty, politene&s;s,
and under&s;tanding, were &s;o &s;u|perior
to the re&s;t of his country|men,
that it was &s;carce credible
&s;o accompli&s;hed a prince &s;hould
be born in &s;o rude and unculti|vated
a &s;oil. He had not &s;een
twenty years when he was obliged
to &s;upport a powerful attack from
a neighbouring kingdom, where
he gave proofs of intrepidity and
conduct. Though he &s;uffered
his troops to repo&s;e after the fa|tigues
of a campaign, he refu&s;ed
<PB N="11" REF="13">
to allow him&s;elf the &s;ame indul|gence;
but pur&s;ued with avidity
the dangerous hunting of the
bear. One day he was pur&s;uing
this diver&s;ion with a &s;plendid re|tinue
of courtiers, he was &s;o
tran&s;ported with ardour for the
chace, that &s;pringing forward in|to
the mid&s;t of the fore&s;t, he left
all his attendants at a di&s;tance;
and the road dividing different
ways, was &s;oon lo&s;t: fore&s;eeing
his error too late,&mdash;night ap|proached;
&mdash;the clouds threa|tened
an impending &s;torm. &s;pur|ring
his hor&s;e till he gained a
large opening in the wood, he
&s;ounded his horn, in hopes it
might reach the ears of the hunt|ers,
but in vain! The faint
gleam of day that remained, &s;ud|denly
became more dark than
midnight, objects were only di&s;|cernable
by fla&s;hes of lightening,
<PB N="12" REF="14">
whil&s;t the roaring of the thunder
and a violent torrent of hail and
rain, added to the horror of the
&s;cene.&mdash;The king endeavoured
to find &s;helter under &s;ome large
pines, but was forced to quit
his retreat to avoid the inunda|tion,
both above and below;
&s;eeking &s;afety from this dreadful
tempe&s;t, he with great fatigue
and labour gained the open field,
but found him&s;elf &s;till more ex|po&s;ed
to the fury of the &s;torm;
ca&s;ting his eyes on every &s;ide, he
at length &s;aw a light from a di&s;|tant
eminence,&mdash;turning his
feet that way, he with infinite
pains arrived at the foot of an
almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible mount, who&s;e
broken fragments formed num|berle&s;s
precipices in the a&s;cent.
Leading his hor&s;e &s;ometimes, at
others mounting him, after more
than two hours toil he approached
<PB N="13" REF="15">
the mouth of a large cavern,
from whence the light i&s;&s;ued that
had encouraged his pur&s;uit: he
he&s;itated a little before he pro|ceeded
farther, apprehending this
to be the retreat of &s;ome notori|ous
robbers who then ravaged
the country, and might rob and
murther him without danger of
di&s;covery. But as the hearts of
monarchs are compo&s;ed of par|ticles
more magnanimous and un|daunted
than tho&s;e of common
mortals, he reproached him&s;elf
for his timidity, and entered the
cavern, his hand upon his &s;word,
determined to defend his life in
ca&s;e of an attack. The chill|ne&s;s
of the cavern almo&s;t froze
his blood.</P>
<P>THE noi&s;e he made brought
a female, who&s;e grey hair and
wrinkled vi&s;age; &s;poke her far
<PB N="14" REF="16">
vanced in years, from the hollow
of the rock. She te&s;tified the
greate&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment, in acco&s;t|ing
him:&mdash;you are, &s;aid &s;he, the
fir&s;t mortal I ever beheld in this
place!&mdash;Do you know, my
lord, to whom it appertains?&mdash;
Indeed, my good woman, I am
totally ignorant. It is, pur&s;ued
&s;he, the cavern of <HI>Aelous,</HI> god of
the winds.&mdash;Here he retires
with his numerous progeny, I
am their mother, and you find
me alone, becau&s;e they are every
one employed in his &s;eparate de|partment
to di&s;pen&s;e ble&s;&s;ings or
misfortunes in the world, accord|ing
to the will of <HI>Jove.</HI> But &s;he
continued, you &s;eem drenched
with rain: I will in&s;tantly kindle
a fire to dry you. What troubles
me is, that you will find but bad
entertainment.&mdash;The winds
make light repa&s;ts:&mdash;men have
<PB N="15" REF="17">
occa&s;ion for more &s;ub&s;tantial ali|ments.</P>
<P>THE king thanked her for &s;o
ho&s;pitable a reception, drawing
near the fire which was lighted
in a moment, by the breath of a
we&s;tern gale, who preceded his
brethren the <HI>North Ea&s;t,</HI> and &s;e|veral
of the northern bla&s;ts: <HI>Ae|lous</HI>
&s;oon appeared, attended by
<HI>Boreas, Au&s;ter, Eaurus,</HI> &amp;c. all
dripping wet;&mdash;their cheeks
&s;welled;&mdash;their hair di&s;order|ed;
&mdash;their manners rough and
boi&s;terous; and when they &s;poke,
the prince was almo&s;t chilled
with their breath.&mdash;One re|counted
his di&s;per&s;ing of a naval
armament;&mdash;another, the ma|ny
ve&s;&s;els he had &s;unk;&mdash;a third,
the care he had taken to pre&s;erve
a fleet of merchant-&s;hips from
falling into the hands of the <HI>Cor|&s;airs.</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="18">
&mdash;Several &s;peaking at once
of rooting up trees, overtunring
buildings and walls;&mdash;each
vaunting his own exploits.&mdash;
The old woman li&s;tened to their
tales.&mdash;but, on a &s;udden &s;he di&s;|covered
the utmo&s;t inquietude:
&mdash;you bring no tidings of
my &s;on <HI>Zephyrus?</HI>&mdash;It is
late, and I confe&s;s my anxiety
that he is not returned?&mdash;All
declared they had &s;een nothing
of their brother.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Adolphus</HI> perceived at
the entrance of the cavern a young
boy, beautiful as <HI>Love</HI> is painted!
The white plumage of his wings
&s;haded with the blu&s;h of ro&s;es,
was &s;o tran&s;parently delicate, as
to be agitated by the flighte&s;t
breeze.&mdash;His fair hair flowed
in graceful ringlets over his &s;houl|ders,
negligently charming.&mdash;
<PB N="17" REF="19">
His bow was was encircled with
a garland of ja&s;&s;amine and ro&s;es;
&mdash;his air, &s;miling, &s;portive
and delightful!</P>
<P>WHERE have you been, little
libertine, cried the old woman,
in a mingled tone of joy and an|ger;
&mdash;all your brothers are
here before you!&mdash;You, alone,
pur&s;ue the dictates of a roving
fancy, regardle&s;s of the pangs
you make me &s;uffer.&mdash;My dear
mother, replied <HI>Zephyrus,</HI> I was
&s;orry to &s;tay out &s;o late, becau&s;e I
feared you would take it ill;&mdash;
but I have been paying a vi&s;it to
the Prince&s;s <HI>Felicia.</HI>&mdash;I found
her walking in her garden, &s;ur|rounded
by her nymphs.&mdash;One
formed a wreath of flowers for
her hair, another reclined upon
a mo&s;&s;y carpet mode&s;tly uncover|ed
part of her neck, to leave me
<PB N="18" REF="20">
the liberty of &s;tealing a ki&s;s;&mdash;
&s;ome danced in parties;&mdash;o|thers
&s;ung to the melody of flutes
&mdash;The faire&s;t prince&s;s in the
world was in a grove of orange
trees;&mdash;my breath fanned the
&s;unbeams from her lips, playing
at thou&s;and &s;portive gambols
round her, and pertly lifting up
her &s;nowy veil.&mdash;<HI>Zephyr,</HI> &s;aid
&s;he, in the &s;weete&s;t voice ima|ginable,
&mdash;how agreeably re|fre&s;hing
I find thee!&mdash;What
plea&s;ure thou give&s;t me! &s;o long
as thou art pre&s;ent, I &s;hall con|tinue
to walk.&mdash;I confe&s;s the&s;e
flattering expre&s;&s;ions from a
mouth &s;o charming, quite en|chanted
me, and I was &s;o little
ma&s;ter of my&s;elf, that I could
never have &s;ummoned a re&s;olu|tion
to leave her, but from the
apprehen&s;ion of your di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="21">
ADOLPHUS hearkened to this
recital with &s;uch extreme &s;atis|faction,
that he regetted its be|ing
fini&s;hed. Permit me ami|able
youth, &s;aid he, to a&s;k in
what country the prince&s;s reigns
of whom you have been &s;peak|ing?
In the i&s;land of <HI>Felicity,</HI>
my lord, an&s;wered <HI>Zephyrus,</HI> a
country inacce&s;&s;ible to mortals.
&mdash;Crouds are ever in &s;earch
of it; but &s;uch is the lot of hu|manity,
they never yet could
find it.&mdash;They make fruitle&s;s
voyages round the coa&s;t, nay,
&s;ometimes flatter them&s;elves with
having gained the port of <HI>Felicity,</HI>
when driven by the tempe&s;ts in|to
&s;ome &s;mall bay, or creak,
they enjoy a &s;hort interval of
calm repo&s;e!&mdash;I have known
&s;everal per&s;ons de&s;irous to fix
their abode in tho&s;e little i&s;les
that encircle the great one, and
<PB N="20" REF="22">
are infinitely inferior in beauty;
but the&s;e are floating, and &s;oon
vani&s;h from the &s;ight;&mdash;and that
re&s;tle&s;s inquietude which will
not &s;uffer mortals long to enjoy,
ever the &s;hadows of tranquillity,
impells them again into the o|cean,
where I every day &s;ee men
of di&s;tingui&s;hed merit peri&s;h.&mdash;
The king a&s;ked &s;everal other
que&s;tions, which <HI>Zephyrus</HI> an&s;|wered
with great veracity and
good &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>IT was extremely late, and
their care&s;ul mother commanded
her childred to retire to their
cells.&mdash;<HI>Zephyrus</HI> offered the
king part of his little bed; which
was more commodiou&s;ly &s;ituated
and warmer than the other con|cavities
in the rock. The bed
was of turf, &s;prinkled with aro|matic
flowers. <HI>Adolphus</HI> threw
<PB N="21" REF="23">
him&s;elf by the &s;ide of <HI>Zephyrus,</HI>
not to &s;leeps but to interrupt
him &s;till farther about the prin|ce&s;s
<HI>Felicia:</HI> how you inflame
my curio&s;ity to &s;ee this tran&s;cen|dant
beauty! &s;aid he to <HI>Zephy|rus.</HI>
&mdash;Is it a thing &s;o ab&s;olutely
impo&s;&s;ible, that with your a&s;&s;i&s;|tance
it cannot be obtained?&mdash;
<HI>Zephyrus</HI> repre&s;ented the ama|zing
danger of the enterprize;
but at length told him if he had
courage enough to tru&s;t &s;uch a
conveyance, he thought he could
contrive to bear him on his
wings through the aerial regions
to this land of <HI>Felicity.</HI> I will
give you a mantle, which, when
you turn the green &s;ide outward,
will render you invi&s;ible, which
is a very nece&s;&s;ary precaution to
pre&s;erve you from terrible mon|&s;ters
that guard the i&s;land; who,
&s;hould they di&s;cern you, brave
<PB N="22" REF="24">
as you are! your life may fall a
&s;acrifice, or, fa&s;cinated by their
power;&mdash;exi&s;tence be con&s;idered
as a cur&s;e. <HI>Adolphus</HI> was &s;o ea|ger
to undertake this perilous
adventure,&mdash;that indifferent to
and fearle&s;s of danger, he ac|cordingly
accepted the offer of
<HI>Zephyrus.</HI></P>
<P>SCARCELY had <HI>Aurora</HI> in her
pearly car, with ro&s;y finger, un|barred
the gates of <HI>Heaven,</HI> when
the impatient monarch of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI>
waked his friend <HI>Zephyrus,</HI> who
was a little drow&s;y: I don't &s;uf|fer
you to take any re&s;t, &s;aid he,
embracing him, but, my gene|rous
ho&s;t, it &s;eems time for us
to begin our journey. Let us a|way
this in&s;tant, my prince, &s;aid
<HI>Zephyrus,</HI> &s;o $ar from complain|ing
of your di&s;turbing me, I am
to thank you.&mdash;For, to let you
<PB N="23" REF="25">
into a &s;ecret, I am in love with
a ro&s;e, who is high &s;pirited and
capricious;&mdash;and I &s;hould have
a violent lecture if I fail paying
my devoirs before &s;unri&s;e. She
blows in one of the Prince&s;s <HI>Fe|licia's</HI>
parterres.&mdash;So &s;aying, he
pre&s;ented the mantle to the king,
and made an effort to take him
upon his wings, but not find|ing
it altogether convenient,&mdash;
I will rai&s;e you in the air as I did
<HI>P&s;yche,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Zephyrus,</HI> when by
the command of <HI>Cupid</HI> I con|veyed
her to the magnificent pa|lace
he had built for her recep|tion?
lifting him in his arms,
and balancing upon the point of
the rock, he extended his wings
and mounted into the air with
a&s;toni&s;hing velocity.&mdash;Notwith|&s;tanding

<P>RESIGNED to de&s;tiny, he be|gan
to recover his vivacity, and
to be attentive to the parts of the

fore&s;ts and continents, yet un|known,
pa&s;&s;ed in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion be|fore
his admiring eyes, and de|prived
him of utterance from the
a&s;toni&s;hment he felt.&mdash;<HI>Zephyrus</HI>
informed him of the names, cu&s;|toms,

Though the fair ro&s;e I adore

&s;oon in view;&mdash;which, from
its collective beauties, the king
was ea&s;ily convinced to be the
work of enchantment: the air
was odoriferous;&mdash;the dew
fell in drops of exqui&s;ite perfume
and the rains in &s;howers &s;cented
with orange flowers:&mdash;foun|tains
and ca&s;cades that &s;eemed
to touch the clouds: groves and
pa&s;tures of a verdure and bloom
unknown in other countries:&mdash;
rivulets, who&s;e tran&s;parent bloom
&s;hone more bright than cry&s;tal,
murmuring in delightful mea|dows:

all that imagination can
form, of walls of diamonds:&mdash;
floors and ceilings inlaid in com|partments
of precious &s;tones.&mdash;
Here gold was more common
than pebbles:&mdash;the fountain
was made, and fancied $ by
tho&s;e fairies who were the cri|terions
of ta&s;te, with &s;uch

could determine which was mo&s;t
to be admired, the elegance or

<P>ZEPHYRUS placed the king

the re&s;t mu&s;t be left

<HI>Adolphus</HI> expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t grate|ful
<PB N="28" REF="30">

impatient to vi&s;it his ro&s;e, left
him to explore the beauties of
the&s;e delicious gardens, to wan|der
in &s;hady walks, or repo&s;e in
grottoes, calculated for plea&s;ure.
&mdash;In one of tho&s;e he was &s;truck
with a <HI>Cupid</HI> in white marble.
who&s;e &s;ymetry and expre&s;&s;ion,
demon&s;trated it a capital perfor|mance
of &s;ome excellent &s;culp|tor.
His altar, in&s;tead of flames,
&s;pouted rere&s;hing &s;treams of wa|ter.
He leaned again&s;t a rock of
&s;hell work, and &s;eemed to read
the following lines engraved on a
marble tablat:</P>
<P>&startq;WHOEVER is ignorant of
the plea&s;ures of love, has ne|ver
ta&s;ted real happine&s;s.&mdash;
That alone &s;atisfies the extent
of our wi&s;hes,&mdash;and renders
<PB N="29" REF="31">
life de&s;ireable. Without love
wealth and ambition grow
languid and in&s;ipid the heart
is unoccupied!&endq;</P>
<P>ADOLPHUS at length entered
a woodbine bower, who&s;e invi|ting
ob&s;curity was impenetrable
to the &s;unbeams; throwing him|&s;elf
on the gra&s;&s;y margin of a
fountain, he &s;uffered &s;leep to
recruit his weary limbs and hea|vy
eylids, with &s;ome hours of
repo&s;e.</P>
<P>IT was midday when he a|waked;
vexed at the time he
had lo&s;t, he advanced ha&s;tily to|wards
the palace,&mdash;and admired
the &s;tyle of architecture with at|tentive
ob&s;ervation, where all
the arts equally combined to e&s;|tabli&s;h
a model of perfection.&mdash;
The king wore his mantle, the
<PB N="30" REF="32">
green &s;ide outward, &s;o that he
could examine every thing, un|perceived;
but whether the gates
through the ve&s;tibule were clo&s;ed
or that the approach to the pa|lace
was in the oppo&s;ite front,
he e&s;&s;ayed in vain to find an en|trance;
when he &s;aw a fair hand
open a cry&s;tal window.&mdash;At
this &s;ignal, a young nymph, who
was at work in the garden, run
to receive a large &s;hell of gold
filagrie, tied with knots of rib|bands,
which &s;he was ordered to
fill with flowers for the prin|ce&s;s;
this &s;he no &s;ooner had &s;e|lected,
than <HI>Adolphus</HI> tran&s;ported
him&s;elf with them into the &s;hell.
It mu&s;t be pre&s;umed the mantle
that conferred invi&s;ibility, be|&s;towed
al&s;o a proportionable de|gree
of levity, otherwi&s;e it would
be difficult to account for the
ea&s;e with which he was drawn
<PB N="31" REF="33">
up to the window, where he ar|rived
without the lea&s;t accident.
He &s;prung out of the &s;hell into
the mid&s;t of a noble &s;aloon,
where he &s;aw and heard things
marvelous to relate.&mdash;The
nymphs were divided into par|ties,
none &s;eemed above eighteen
years of age; and many much
younger. The beauties of the
fair and brown were blended in
the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite perfection; &s;o
that every nymph &s;ingly, might
be deemed completely hand&s;ome.</P>
<P>ADOLPHUS would have re|mained
facinated with admira|tion,
if the &s;weetne&s;s of female
voices according to the melody
of mu&s;ical in&s;truments as, judici|ou&s;ly
touched, had not excited
his curio&s;ity. He moved to|wards
the appartment from
whence the delightful harmony
<PB N="32" REF="34">
proceeded, and though he ap|prehended
the beauties of the la|dies
on the &s;aloon, could not be
exceeded, he felt a peculiar plea|&s;ure
in being convinced of his
mi&s;take; but what was his a|mazement
to find, that by a kind
of intuition, he under&s;tood the
meaning of every &s;ong, though
the language was new to his ear!
li&s;tening enraptured, to one of
the prettie&s;t nymphs, her veil fell
off, when, not con&s;idering how
much it mu&s;t alarm her, he took
it from the ground and pre&s;ented
it&mdash;Seeing the veil apparently
move,&mdash;&s;he &s;creamed! and, per|haps
this was the fir&s;t emotion
of fear, ever experienced in this
i&s;land of <HI>Felicity.</HI> Her com|panions
a&s;&s;embled round her, a&s;k|ing
the cau&s;e of this unu&s;ual
&s;ound.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="35">
You will think me &s;trangely
whim&s;ical, &s;aid &s;he, when I tell
you I dropped my vell, and re|ceived
it again from an invi&s;ible
hand. They laughed exceed|ingly
at the oddity of the fancy,
and run into the appartment of
the prince&s;s to divert her with the
tale.</P>
<P>ADOLPUS followed, by favour
of the green mantle, through
halls, galleries, and chambers
innumerable, till he entered the
appartment of the &s;overeign,&mdash;
&s;eated on a throne, compo&s;ed of
a &s;ingle carbuncle, brighter than
the &s;un, The eyes of the prin|ce&s;s
<HI>Felicia</HI> &s;hot forth rays &s;till
more bright than the carbuncle!
The bloom of cele&s;tial youth
and beauty, glowed on her cheek;
&mdash;animated her whole per&s;on and
air&punc;&mdash;accompanied with that
<PB N="34" REF="36">
graceful maje&s;ty, and &s;en&s;ible vi|vacity
calculated to in&s;pire ado|ration
and reverence.&mdash;Her dre&s;s
&s;eemed more the re&s;ult of ele|gance
than magnificence.&mdash;Her
fair hair was carele&s;sly adorned
with flowers.&mdash;She had on a
loo&s;e robe of gold and white
gauze,&mdash;with a pale purple
veil;&mdash;&s;everal little cupids wan|toned
round her, playing a thou|&s;and
&s;portive fooleries to amu&s;e
her;&mdash;&s;ome ki&s;&s;ed her hands,
&mdash;others a&s;&s;i&s;ted their com|panions
to mount the &s;ides of the
throne, and place a diamond of
pearl on her head.&mdash;The <HI>plea|&s;ures</HI>
and <HI>graces</HI> were her con|&s;tant
attendants.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, all that mortals can
conceive of paradi&s;e, is faint to
what the king of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> &s;aw re|alized.
&mdash;Dazzled with the &s;plen|dor
<PB N="35" REF="37">
of tho&s;e immortal charms, to
which he already found his heart
devoted, he remained in an exta&s;iy
of wonder that rivetted his feet,
and agitated his &s;pirits &s;o ex|tremely,
that forgetting all things
but the object of his adoration,&mdash;
he let the green mantle fall.&mdash;
The prince&s;s &s;tarted with &s;urprize.
She had never &s;een a man.</P>
<P>ADOLPHUS, &s;en&s;ible he was
di&s;covered, fell at her feet, and
regarding her with the profound|e&s;t
re&s;pect,&mdash;Great prince&s;s, he
began, I have traver&s;ed the aerial
regions to admire your divine
beauty;&mdash;to offer you my vows;
&mdash;to entreat your acceptance of
the mo&s;t con&s;tant of all hearts.
&mdash;Though <HI>Felicia</HI> had an un|common
&s;hare of wit and vivaci|ty,
&s;he continued &s;ilent and di&s;|concerted.
&mdash;Never had &s;he be|held
<PB N="36" REF="38">
a creature that appeared
more amiable in her eyes! than
what &s;he contemplated as a &s;in|gular
production of nature; a
thought that led her to believe
this might be the phoenix, &s;o
renowned for &s;uperlative beauty&punc;
&mdash;This error occa&s;ioned her to
addre&s;s him thus:</P>
<P>FAIR phoenix, for your beau|ty

is nothing in my i&s;land half &s;o

cannot help regretting you are
the only one of your &s;pecies.&mdash;
What a glorious appearance
would a flight of &s;uch birds as
you make, all mounted on the
wing! <HI>Adolphus</HI> could not for|bear
&s;miling at the &s;implicity of

<P>IT came into the head of <HI>A|dolphus</HI>
one day, to a&s;k the prin|ce&s;s
how long he had been in

He began to ruminate,

had not been entirely engro&s;&s;ed
with the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing her.
That if the abbe&s;s approved it,
&s;he had a great inclination to learn
to draw, as her melancholy was
<PB N="58" REF="60">
&s;o extreme, &s;he ought to neglect

that you will &s;ometimes &s;pare

avoided joining the con|ver&s;ation,

&s;atisfaction of thinking he
&s;hould &s;ee his mi&s;tre&s;s every day,

have changed &s;ituations with the

<P>THINGS thus &s;ettled, <HI>Hyppo|litus</HI>

&mdash;He related to her
the particulars of <HI>Lucilla's</HI> mar|riage

her regard for that generous

fled with you. Why is my hu&s;band
enraged? Why the cruel treat|ment
I experience from his fury?

elope together. Ah! my dear

remain here.</P>
<P>YOU are unwilling, madam,
to do ju&s;tice either to your&s;elf or

agitated; can the world con|demn
you for breaking your
chains? For freeing your&s;elf
from a convent where you are
unworthily confined without any
ju&s;tifiable cau&s;e? If prudence
forbids me to accompany you,&mdash;
it will &s;uffer me to follow you.

natural to the human heart than
<PB N="62" REF="64">

when we are deprived of it?&mdash;
My dear <HI>Julia,</HI> if ever you have

my character! <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> &s;till

<P>ON this melancholy occa&s;ion,

them they &s;oon &s;hould meet a|gain,

to li&s;ten to her &s;oothing voice.</P>
<P>CARDINI was entru&s;ted with
the management of the corre&s;|pondence
between the lovers,
and received a bountiful reward
for the &s;ervices already perform|ed,
as well as for tho&s;e in rever|&s;ion.
The abbe&s;s was informed
the father of <HI>Jeronymo,</HI> had re|called
him to <HI>Italy,</HI> nor was it
without regret &s;he &s;aw him de|part;
whil&s;t <HI>Julia,</HI> who had &s;uf|fered
the mo&s;t violent con&s;traint
in concealing her extreme afflic|tion,
abandoned her&s;elf to the
unbounded indulgence of unut|terable
woe. When her &s;train|ing
eyes had lo&s;t all traces of the
object of their delight, &s;he fa&s;|tened
the door of her chamber,
and &s;inking upon the bed, more
<PB N="73" REF="75">
dead than alive, a torrent of tears
afforded &s;ome relief to her bur&s;t|ing
heart. She feigned &s;ickne&s;s
as an apology for keeping her a|partment,
the better to conceal
her mi&s;ery; but a &s;hort time
rendered its weight in&s;upport|able,
when &s;he received no let|ters
from <HI>Hyppolitus.</HI>&mdash;Frantic
with grief, &s;he wrote to the earl
of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> to enquire whether her
father or his friend was arrived
in <HI>London.</HI> He an&s;wered he was
in the utmo&s;t anxiety that neither
of them were returned, e&s;pecially
as the death of the earl of <HI>Doug|las</HI>
made his &s;on's pre&s;ence indi&s;|pen&s;ibly
requi&s;ite.</P>
<P>As tho&s;e things we dread the
mo&s;t, are tho&s;e we are mo&s;t rea|dy
to believe, the de&s;ponding
<HI>Julia</HI> had little doubt but her lo|ver
was &s;hipwrecked;&mdash;and
<PB N="74" REF="76">
though in the agony of &s;epara|tion,
&s;he fancied nothing was ca|pable
of augmenting her &s;orrow,
&s;he proved alas! that the giver
of misfortune was not yet ex|hau&s;ted,
and that the cruelty of
her de&s;tiny was &s;till ingenious in
furni&s;hing new &s;cenes of tor|ment.</P>
<P>ONE day &s;he was in bed, in
the mo&s;t deplorable dejection of
&s;pirits, when the abbe&s;s paid her
a vi&s;it, and in retiring carele&s;&s;ly,
dropped a letter &s;he had that
morning received. <HI>I&s;abella</HI> took
it up, and pre&s;ented it to her
mi&s;tre&s;s, who in&s;tantly recog|nized
the characters of the earl

a trembling hand, and found
the&s;e words:</P>

<P>THE fair <HI>Julia</HI> remained thun|der

<PB N="76" REF="78">
in her mind what was
the mo&s;t eligible &s;tep to take,&mdash;
&s;en&s;ible &s;he ought no longer to
delay her removal from a place
where &s;he mu&s;t &s;oon be expo&s;ed
to the ira&s;cibility of the earl of
<HI>Bedford;</HI> &s;he took a &s;udden re|&s;olution,
and &s;ent <HI>I&s;abella</HI> to de|&s;ire
<HI>Cardini</HI> would contrive &s;ome
pretext for coming into her a|partment.
When he came, &s;he
entreated him to take &s;ome
jewels of her's and di&s;po&s;e of
them at <HI>Moulins,</HI> and to purcha&s;e
a chariot and a pair of hor&s;es
with the money,&mdash;taking all ne|ce&s;&s;ary
precautions of &s;ecre&s;y;&mdash;
likewi&s;e to buy a riding dre&s;s of
the common &s;ort, and as &s;oon as
all were ready, he &s;hould have
hor&s;es in waiting the following
night, to carry them to <HI>Moulins.</HI>
&mdash;The difficulty was to e&s;cape
un&s;een, but as her apartment was
<PB N="77" REF="79">
next the garden, &s;he determined
to hazard de&s;cending by a lad|der
of ropes, which <HI>Cardini</HI> en|gaged
to provide.&mdash;Luckily,
part of the garden wall had fallen
down, which &s;he imagined would
facilitate her purpo&s;e of climbing
over it.</P>
<P>EVERY thing an&s;wered her
expectation: <HI>Cardini</HI> who had
free egre&s;s and regre&s;s to the
convent, acquitted him&s;elf with
the utmo&s;t zeal and addre&s;s.&mdash;
He conducted <HI>Julia</HI> and <HI>I&s;abella</HI>
to <HI>Moulins,</HI> where they found a
chariot ready for the pro&s;ecution
of their journey <HI>Julia</HI> pre&s;ented
the painter with a ring of con|&s;iderable
value, and commi&s;&s;ioned
him to go to <HI>London,</HI> and acquaint
the earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> and <HI>Hyppo|litus,</HI>
with the occa&s;ion of her
flight, and of her re&s;olution to
<PB N="78" REF="80">
remain at <HI>Florence</HI> with <HI>Lucilla,</HI>
till &s;he heard of their &s;afety.&mdash;
She was unwilling to tru&s;t the
particulars to writing, for fear
&s;ome unfortunate chance &s;hould
reveal it to the earl of <HI>Bedford;</HI>
not doubting but his knowledge
of her being at St. <HI>Menoux,</HI> was
procured by the interception of
her letters, or tho&s;e of <HI>Hyppo|litus.</HI></P>
<P>WHILST <HI>Julia</HI> continued to
travel with all po&s;&s;ible diligence,
taking every precaution to avoid
di&s;covery, and conceal from ob|&s;ervation
that exqui&s;ite beauty
which drew admiration from the
&s;pectators.&mdash;<HI>Cardini,</HI> after at|tending
her as far as prudence
would permit, returned to St.
<HI>Menoux,</HI> to avoid &s;urprize, and
applying to his work with &s;eem|ing
attention, expected every
<PB N="79" REF="81">
moment to hear a general alarm
in the convent. The morning
was far advanced when one of
the nuns came to acquaint the
abbe&s;s, that <HI>Julia's</HI> apartment
was &s;till locked, and though <HI>I&s;a|bella</HI>
had been called &s;everal
times, no an&s;wer was returned,
which made her apprehend
this profound &s;ilence boded &s;ome|thing
extraordinary. The ab|be&s;s
was di&s;turbed at her relati|on,
and gave in&s;tant orders for
breaking open the door; but
when on entering her apart|ment,
&s;he was convinced that
<HI>Julia</HI> had made her e&s;cape;&mdash;
nothing could excede the wildne&s;s
of her behaviour.</P>
<P>SHE &s;ent me&s;&s;enger after me&s;|&s;enger
towards <HI>Paris,</HI> concluding
that mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be the road
&s;he had taken. At a lo&s;s what
to conjecture, her &s;u&s;picion re&s;ted
<PB N="80" REF="82">
next upon <HI>Cardini;</HI>&mdash;he was ar|re&s;ted,
examined before a ma|gi&s;trate,
and committed to pri|&s;on,
without being able to draw
the lea&s;t information by this
rough u&s;age.&mdash;I expect the earl
of <HI>Bedford</HI> every moment, &s;aid
the abbe&s;s, to tho&s;e in whom
&s;he confided; he will demand
his wife! what an&s;wer can I
give? How will he accu&s;e me
of carele&s;s neglect? and what
excu&s;es can I form for inatten|tion
to a tru&s;t he &s;o earne&s;tly re|commended?</P>
<P>IN this di&s;tre&s;s; one of her fa|vourites
hit upon an expedient
that might for &s;ome time at lea&s;t,
retard the earl's arrival, and the
reproaches &s;he dreaded. I think,
madam, &s;aid &s;he, you &s;hould
write the earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> word
immediately, that his lady was
<PB N="81" REF="83">
&s;uddenly &s;eized with an inflam|matory
fever, which carried her
off in a few days; that &s;he was ta|ken
all po&s;&s;ible care of, and that
you had rendered her the la&s;t du|ties
&s;uitable to her quality; that
&s;he had bequeathed her jewels
and wardrobe to her maid <HI>I&s;a|bella;</HI>
&s;o that there was nothing
left worth returning.</P>
<P>THE abbe&s;s reli&s;hed the de|ception
extremely, not con&s;ider|ing
the con&s;equences that might
attend it; &s;he was a woman of
birth, with no great depth of
under&s;tanding, therefore &s;uffered
her&s;elf to be governed by the
<HI>young religious,</HI> who delivered the
coun&s;el. She accordingly wrote
to the earl, to acquaint him
with the death of the counte&s;s:
but this &s;tep did not contribute
towards the relea&s;e of the unfor|tunate
<PB N="82" REF="84">
<HI>Cardini,</HI> who&s;e impri&s;on|ment
was of long duration; nor
was he permitted to plead in his
own de&s;ence, or acquaint his
friends with the &s;tate to which
he was reduced.</P>
<P>IN the mean time <HI>Julia</HI> ar|rived
at <HI>Florence</HI> without any
di&s;agreeable accident;&mdash;and
judging it improper to vi&s;it her
friend till &s;he had given previous
notice, &s;he wrote by <HI>I&s;abella</HI> to
acquaint her with her de&s;ire to
concert proper mea&s;ures with her
for her &s;ecurity.&mdash;<HI>Lucilla</HI> was in|expre&s;&s;ibly
delighted to hear of
her arrival, nor would her im|patience
to &s;ee her, allow the de|ferring
it a &s;ingle moment.&mdash;
Their meeting was all that the
mo&s;t cordial and &s;incere friend|&s;hip
can expre&s;s from per&s;ons of
&s;en&s;ibility and tenderne&s;s; and
<PB N="83" REF="85">
agreed <HI>Julia</HI> &s;hould a&s;&s;ume the
character of a young widow, a
near relation to <HI>Lucilla,</HI> who in|tended
to pa&s;s &s;ome months at
<HI>Florence:</HI> &s;he was to take the
name of <HI>Howard,</HI> the fir&s;t family
in <HI>England;</HI> &s;o exten&s;ive in its
branches as not to be ea&s;ily traced,
and to appear in deep mourning,
as having recently buried a hu&s;|band
extremely dear, which was
the cau&s;e of her abandoning a
country that perpetually remind|ed
her of her lo&s;s.</P>
<P>WHAT was &s;ingular enough
is, that at the very time <HI>Julia</HI>
was playing this mockery of
woe, the earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> was
preparing to act the &s;ame part
more &s;trenuou&s;ly. The abbe&s;s's
letter was delivered ju&s;t in time
to prevent his embarkation.&mdash;
The fir&s;t emotions of grief were
<PB N="84" REF="86">
lively for the death of a wife he
had &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately loved;&mdash;but
reflexions on the length of his
voluntary &s;eparation;&mdash;on the
&s;ubject of complaint he believed
&s;he had given him,&mdash;joined to
the natural incon&s;tancy of man,
&s;oon con&s;oled his affliction, and
di&s;po&s;ed him to indulge his
thoughts with any thing rather
than the remembrance of <HI>Julia.</HI></P>
<P>THE report &s;oon became cur|rent.
The counte&s;s of <HI>Douglas,</HI>
and the earl of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> were in
the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s; and the earl
of <HI>Warwick,</HI> who landed in
<HI>England,</HI> &s;oon after the melan|choly
tidings, was almo&s;t as deep|ly
affected as if he had been per|&s;onally
acquainted with the beau|ty,
merit, and virtue of his ami|able
daughter. Is not my fate
truly deplorable, &s;aid he, deliver|ed
<PB N="85" REF="87">
from the rigour of a long and
painful captivity.&mdash;re&s;tored to
my country after a tedious ab|&s;ence;
&mdash;only to hear of the death
of an only child, who&s;e virtues
have been repre&s;ented with the
highe&s;t encomiums.&mdash;Endeared
by the memory of her excellent
mother, as well as her own ac|compli&s;hments.
&mdash;Alas! I had
promi&s;ed her as a recompence,
to the only man in the world, to
whom I have the &s;tronge&s;t obli|gations;
&mdash;at the very moment
&s;he falls a &s;acrifice to the un|kindne&s;s
of an arbitrary hu&s;band!</P>
<P>THE earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> &s;olicited
through the mediation of friends
that Lord <HI>Warwick</HI> would per|mit
him the honour to wait on
him;&mdash;but the application was
rejected with re&s;entment and in|dignation
by a father who con|&s;idered
<PB N="86" REF="88">
him as the murderer of
his daughter. Things were in
this &s;ituation when <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
made his appearance; what im|peded
his voyage was, that in
po&s;ting from <HI>Paris</HI> to <HI>Calais,</HI> as
the mo&s;t expeditious method of
travelling, his hor&s;e fell, and in
di&s;engaging him&s;elf from under
him, <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> di&s;located his
ancle; the pain was &s;o acute,
that with his valet's a&s;&s;i&s;tance,
it was not without the utmo&s;t
difficulty he walked to an adja|cent
village, where the bone was
&s;et by an un&s;kilful &s;urgeon, who
made him &s;uffer &s;uch agony in
the operation, as brought on a
violent fever, which confined
him two months. Fear of a|larming
the tenderne&s;s of <HI>Julia</HI>
occa&s;ioned him not to acquaint
her with this misfortune, and
the method he u&s;ed to prevent
<PB N="87" REF="89">
her unhappine&s;s proved the very
cau&s;e of it. A &s;ilence &s;o extraor|dinary
made her de&s;perate.&mdash;
It was now that <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> was
to take his &s;hare of &s;uffering,
when the fir&s;t things he heard
in <HI>London,</HI> was the death of his
father, and that of his beloved
<HI>Julia;</HI> for the abbe&s;s of St. <HI>Me|noux's</HI>
letter, falling into the
hands of the counte&s;s of <HI>Doug|las,</HI>
&s;he was tempted to &s;hew it
to her &s;on, from a hope &s;he en|tertained
that the certainty of
the fatal event, was the only ra|dical
cure for a pa&s;&s;ion which had
been the &s;ource of all his misfor|tunes.
&mdash;The di&s;turber of his
tranquillity, whil&s;t it checked all
views of aggrandizement and
promotion.</P>
<P>HYPPOLITUS had been long
enough at St. <HI>Menoux</HI> to enter
<PB N="88" REF="90">
minutely into the abbe&s;s's cha|racter,
ill calculated for a plot;
he therefore yielded an implicit
faith to her report that extin|gui&s;hed
the faint ray of hope &s;till
&s;truggling in his &s;oul.</P>
<P>WHERE can I find words ca|pable
of expre&s;&s;ing the de&s;pair of
the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate and faithful
heart in the world? All former
de&s;criptions of the &s;tate he was
reduced to by the marriage of
<HI>Julia;</HI>&mdash;the &s;chemes laid to &s;e|parate
them;&mdash;the violent pro|ceedings
of her hu&s;band,&mdash;con|vey
but a faint idea of the di&s;|traction
of <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> in a con|juncture
&s;o terrible to human na|ture!
He refu&s;ed to &s;ee or &s;peak
to any, but the earls of <HI>Warwick</HI>
and <HI>Su&s;&s;ex;</HI> nor could any thing
but the urgent entreaties of a
weeping mother have prevailed
<PB N="89" REF="91">
on him to take the lea&s;t nouri&s;h|ment;
nor could he &s;leep more
than in broken &s;tarts on his un|ea&s;y
bed;&mdash;he &s;unk &s;uddenly
into a depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits and
a decay of &s;trength that prog|no&s;ticated
the mo&s;t melancholy
con&s;equences.</P>
<P>To the earl of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> he con|fided
his determined re&s;olution
to challenge the earl of <HI>Bedford,</HI>
the only pro&s;pect capable of ani|mating
him with fre&s;h courage
and vigour: he de&s;ired his friend
to demand the time and place of
appointment in his name, for
putting a period to a quarrel that
could not be terminated but by
the death of the injurer or in|jured.
The earl of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> ex|patiated
on the ra&s;hne&s;s of a man's
engaging in a duel who had
&s;carcely &s;trength to walk to the
<PB N="90" REF="92">
place of action.&mdash;<HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
replied, he was the be&s;t judge of
what he was capable;&mdash;that de&s;|pair
would &s;upply all defects.&mdash;
At the mo&s;t he could but die;&mdash;
and to mea&s;ure &s;words with the
enemy of his peace, was the lea&s;t
circum&s;tance likely to appall him!
After many repeated in&s;tances,
the earl found it in vain to con|tend
again&s;t a point &s;o ab&s;olutely
&s;ettled in the brea&s;t of his friend:
&mdash;he therefore waited on the
earl of <HI>Bedford,</HI> and found him
very irre&s;olute what an&s;wer to
return. The earl, in truth, was
but lately recovered of the wounds
he had received from <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
at <HI>Calais;</HI>&mdash;he was convinced
of his valour, and &s;en&s;ible of
the powerful motives of his ani|mo&s;ity:</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="93">
AFTER &s;ome pau&s;e, he ob|&s;erved
that, though the king had
te&s;tified his di&s;approbation of
duelling, he was ready to accept
the challenge; but it was pro|per
their meeting &s;hould appear
accidental; when he would draw
and fini&s;h the controver&s;y.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had Lord <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI>
taken his leave, than the earl of
<HI>Bedford</HI> made a &s;peedy arrange|ment
of his affairs, and left the
kingdom.&mdash;<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> &s;ought
him every where, and did not
di&s;cover he was gone abroad till
it was too late to overtake him.
&mdash;He was exceedingly mortified
at the di&s;appointment of his only
&s;urviving hope, to &s;acrifice this
victim to the manes of his ado|rable
<HI>Julia.</HI>&mdash;He could no long|er
endure the &s;ight of places
which renewed the tortures in
<PB N="92" REF="94">
his memory, the &s;cenes of irre|trievable
happine&s;s! He deter|mined
to fly from a country once
&s;o dear, and to bury him&s;elf and
his misfortunes in di&s;tant fields
of glory.</P>
<P>FINDING his re&s;olution not to
be &s;haken, the earl of <HI>Warwick</HI>
propo&s;ed his accompanying him
to <HI>Malta,</HI> where he was return|ing
with the <HI>grand con&s;ervator</HI> of
<HI>Mont&s;errat,</HI> who had been a
&s;hort time in <HI>England,</HI> and to
whom the queen, in complai|&s;ance
to Cardinal <HI>Pole's</HI> &s;olicita|tion,
had granted the re&s;titution
of all the forfeited e&s;tates of the
knights of <HI>Malta. Hyppolitus</HI>
gladly accepted an occa&s;ion of
&s;ignalizing his gallantry, as well
as of attaching him&s;elf to the
fortune of a nobleman whom he
loved as a father, and honoured
<PB N="93" REF="95">
with &s;ingular e&s;teem for his ex|alted
qualities.&mdash;The earl of
<HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> was de&s;irous to join the
party. as he had particular rea|&s;ons
to retire from court.</P>
<P>QUEEN MARY was unwil|ling
to grant to the &s;olicitations
of him&s;elf and friends, the return
of the marchione&s;s of <HI>Northamp|ton;</HI>
&s;he &s;till continued to per|&s;ecute
the memory of her unfor|tunate
hu&s;band in the per&s;on of
his beautiful widow, and as her
maje&s;ty had been informed the
the earl was de&s;perately in love
with her, and eagerly wi&s;hed to
marry her, &s;he made a point of
oppo&s;ing their union; and, as a
&s;tep towards it, expre&s;&s;ed her
wi&s;h that he would think of Lord
<HI>Montagu's</HI> daughter. She had
ju&s;t appointed the father amba&s;|&s;ador
to the holy &s;ee, together
with the bi&s;hop of <HI>Ely;</HI>&mdash;his
<PB N="94" REF="96">
lord&s;hip recommended her to the
queen, and begged her maje&s;ty
would be troubled with her e&s;|tabli&s;hment.
The queen, tho|roughly
acquainted with the me|rit,
birth and fortune of Lord
<HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> thought &s;he could not
di&s;po&s;e of her more advantage|ou&s;ly
than to that nobleman, but
he, incapable of &s;acrificing the
pa&s;&s;ion of love to that of ambi|tion,
prudently re&s;olved to with|draw,
till the queen altered her
&s;entiments; and beheld an occa|&s;ion
with plea&s;ure that in&s;epara|bly
united his fate with that of
his intimate friend, with whom
he might acquire laurels, or die

&s;everal other ve&s;&s;els. The
number of knights and &s;laves

appeared in the harbour with two
galleys painted and guilt. The
magnificence of this prince was
equal in every particular to his
illu&s;trious birth:&mdash;he was hand|&s;ome,
liberal, gallant, brave and
magnanimous. General <HI>de la

mo&s;t inhuman mind. At a lo&s;s
where to direct her trembling
&s;teps, &s;he looked round with im|ploring
eyes, and perceived a
&s;hepherd's cot on the edge of a
valley, which revived her hopes,
when they were ju&s;t expiring.&mdash;
She here found a &s;hepherde&s;s at
work in a little garden, who
&s;truck with her deplorable ap|pearance,
and wildne&s;s of di&s;tre&s;s,
received her with marks of ten|derne&s;s
that afforded &s;ome con|&s;olation
to the lovely wanderer.
O, &s;aid &s;he, with impetuo&s;ity,
dear good woman, if you are
di&s;po&s;ed confer a benefit that will
<PB N="119" REF="121">
bind me to you for ever; find
out quickly &s;ome place to con|ceal
me from my pur&s;uers, who
will &s;oon tear me hence by force.
The &s;hepherde&s;s, without loo&s;ing
a moment, led her to a hayloft,
filled with fodder for &s;heep, and
covering her &s;ecurely, returned
to her &s;pade:&mdash;ju&s;t after, two
hor&s;emen on full gallop, &s;topped
at the hut, and que&s;tioned her
with great earne&s;tne&s;s about a
young lady for whom they were
in &s;earch; intermixing threats
with their enquiries:&mdash;&s;he de|nied
having &s;een her, with an
unembara&s;&s;ed &s;implicity, that in|duced
them to turn their hor&s;es,
and ride off.</P>
<P>THEY were no &s;ooner depart|ed,
than the &s;hepherde&s;s ran to
the relief of <HI>Julia,</HI> who heard
the the Senator <HI>Alberti's</HI> voice,
<PB N="120" REF="122">
and was half dead with terror;
but revived with the news that
the men were gone!&mdash;Her kind
ho&s;te&s;s brought her &s;ome milk
and bread, wa&s;hed the blood
from her face, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in re|pairing
her garments with chari|table
indu&s;try.</P>
<P>JULIA was unwilling to leave
this rural &s;pot, judging it un&s;afe
to venture out till the hurry of
the cha&s;e was over. Her thoughts
were in the utmo&s;t perplexity;
much had &s;he to fear from the
machinations of <HI>Alberti,</HI> but more
from tho&s;e of her unknown e|nemy,
who continued to wear
his ma&s;que till their &s;eparation.
&mdash;It &s;eemed a le&s;s difficulty to
guard again&s;t the attempts of a
per&s;on &s;he knew, than to di&s;|tru&s;t
every body who offered her
<PB N="121" REF="123">
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould inad|vertently
run into the very dan|ger
&s;he &s;tudied to avoid.</P>
<P>THIS agitation of mind aug|mented
the weakne&s;s of her bo|dy.
&mdash;The &s;hepherd returned
in the evening, and it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary
<HI>Julia</HI> &s;hould con&s;ent to
his being made acquainted with
her &s;ituation.</P>
<P>THE &s;hepherd was a penetra|ting
old man, who properly con|jectured
by the admirable beauty
of his new gue&s;t, and the ma|terials
of her dre&s;s, that &s;he mu&s;t
be above the common rank.&mdash;
He was touched with her pecu|liar
di&s;tre&s;s. <HI>Julia</HI> a&s;ked if he
had &s;een any gentlemen on hor&s;e|back
that day? He an&s;wered
&s;everal, &s;ome of which were
ma&s;qued, and &s;eemed wounded,
<PB N="122" REF="124">
yet were riding full &s;peed. One
he &s;aid, rode off from his com|panions
to the field where he was
at work, and enquired whether
he had not met with a young la|dy
unattended;&mdash;that an&s;wer|ing
in the negative, the per&s;on
continued his road.</P>
<P>JULIA, convinced &s;he was the
object of his enquiry, pa&s;&s;ed one
of the mo&s;t uncomfortable nights
&s;he had ever experienced. For|tunately
&s;he had her pur&s;e and
&s;ome jewels about her, not hav|ing
began to undre&s;s, when &s;he
&s;at down to write: this enabled
her to make &s;uch pecuniary ac|knowledgments
to the good
folks $or their ho&s;pitality as
might at the &s;ame time engage
them from intere&s;ted con&s;idera|tions
to &s;erve her with fidelity.
You &s;ee the di&s;tre&s;s I am in, &s;aid
&s;he, bur&s;ting into tears, and the
<PB N="123" REF="125">
ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity I am under of
leaving you, and &s;eeking &s;helter
in &s;ome place of &s;afety.&mdash;But
tell me, how I may travel un|di&s;covered?
&mdash;I am too much
terrified to judge for my|&s;elf.
&mdash;I &s;hould think, ma|dam,
&s;aid the &s;hepherde&s;s, would
you vouchfa&s;e to put on one of
my caps and gowns, you would
never be found out. <HI>Julia</HI> ac|cepted
the offer, and was &s;oon
transformed into a &s;hepherde&s;s;
&mdash;but &s;he appeared &s;o charming,
that the good man and his wife
both agreed it was impo&s;&s;ible for
any dre&s;s to deprive her of that
natural air of dignity, &s;o con|&s;picuous
in her every motion.</P>
<P>AFTER &s;ome little con&s;idera|tion,
he advi&s;ed her to conceal
her &s;ex under a pilgrim's habit,
and as &s;he was very tall, thought
&s;he might un&s;u&s;pectedly pa&s;s for
<PB N="124" REF="126">
a young man. She approved his
council, and entreated him to
buy what was requi&s;ite at <HI>Sienna.</HI>
He &s;et out in&s;tantly to execute
her orders; and whil&s;t he is thus
employed, let us return to what
pa&s;&s;ed in <HI>Florence.</HI></P>
<P>THE very night, as I have be|fore
ob&s;erved, that <HI>Julia</HI> was
&s;eized by per&s;ons unknown, had
been fixed upon by <HI>Alberti</HI> for
the &s;ame de&s;ign, <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> &s;educed
by one of <HI>Lucilla's</HI> women to
di&s;continue her attendance long|er
than ordinary, and beginning
to fear &s;he might keep her
lady up too late, entered her
apartment, &s;oon after &s;he had
been forced from it. Seeing the
fragments of her veil on the floor,
the table, chairs, and candles o|verturned,
and <HI>Julia</HI> gone, &s;he
concluded &s;ome new misfortune
<PB N="125" REF="127">
had happened, and cried out in
a manner that alarmed the fa|mily,
particularly the &s;enator,
who was preparing for the com|mencement
of the &s;cene he in|tended
to exhibit. The di&s;tre&s;s
of <HI>I&s;abella</HI> announced the cau&s;e;
in a tran&s;port of de&s;pair, he or|dered
his &s;ervants, already armed,
to pur&s;ue the ravi&s;hers.&mdash;He
learned from the porter of the
gate <HI>La Croix,</HI> that money had
been given him to admit a coach
and &s;ix to pa&s;s in the night,
under pretence of avoiding the
heat of the weather. <HI>Leander,</HI>
di&s;turbed with the uproar in the
hou&s;e, mounted his hor&s;e, and
joined the train by the time they
overtook the coach; the battle,
from the &s;uperiority of numbers
on the <HI>Alberti</HI> &s;ide was of &s;hort
duration: the chief finding him|&s;elf
wounded, e&s;&s;ayed to gain the tains.
<PB N="126" REF="128">
followed by his &s;ervants&punc;
one only was di&s;abled from pro|ceeding
farther, whom <HI>Leander</HI>
ob&s;erving di&s;mounted, and ta|king
off his ma&s;que, u&s;ed every
per&s;wa&s;ion to induce him to re|veal
the truth. But all he could
obtain was, that aparently, his
ma&s;ter was in love with <HI>Julia,</HI>
as he had long &s;ince formed a
re&s;olution to carry her off;&mdash;
that what precipitated the execu|tion
of this de&s;ign, was a &s;ervant
of <HI>Alberti's,</HI> whom he had bribed
to facilitate his enterprize, adver|ti&s;ing
him that the &s;enator in|tended
taking the lady away that
very night. <HI>Leander</HI> a&s;ked the
name of his ma&s;ter, but received
no an&s;wer to that que&s;tion.&mdash;
Con$ider, &s;ir, &s;aid the man, in a
voice &s;carcely articulate, I am
dying, and allow me a few mi|nutes
<PB N="127" REF="129">
to reconcile my&s;elf with
<HI>Heaven.</HI> A quarter of an hour
decided his fate.</P>
<P>ALBERTI returned to <HI>Flo|rence</HI>
in the mo&s;t violent agita|tion
of mind, and when he had
&s;hut him&s;elf up in his clo&s;et, re|collected
a paper he had gathered
up in <HI>Julia's</HI> apartment, which
&s;eemed her own hand-writing;
taking it from his pocket, he
&s;oon had the &s;en&s;ible mortifica|tion
to be convinced her heart
was engaged; and that this pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
accounted for her cold|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>I FLATTERED my&s;elf, he ex|claimed,
that at lea&s;t her indif|ference
was general, and that
&s;he treated me with as much
complai&s;ance as &s;he did the re&s;t
of the world!&mdash;Alas! how
<PB N="128" REF="130">
much was I mi&s;taken! that pro|found
melancholy in which &s;he
was plunged, was the effect of
her lover's ab&s;ence, and the con|temptuous
&s;corn with which &s;he
repaid my addre&s;&s;es, was a &s;a|crifice
&s;he offered to his vanity;
ruminating long who this dear
<HI>dear Hyppolitus</HI> might be,&mdash;to
whom the letter was addre&s;&s;ed,
he recollected the brother of <HI>Ju|lia,</HI>
the hand&s;ome,&mdash;the accom|pli&s;hed
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> formed to
charm, and to be charmed! A
mortal trepidation &s;eized him at
the idea of his formidable rival!
Good <HI>Heaven!</HI> &s;aid he, can I
have the temerity at my age, to
contend with him for &s;o fair a
prize?</P>
<P>PENETRATED with grief, he
entered his daughter-in-law's
appartment.&mdash;Calm my di&s;|turbed
<PB N="129" REF="131">
imagination <HI>Lucilla,</HI> &s;aid
he with impetuo&s;ity;&mdash;I know
your brother is the lover of your
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> friend? I conjure you
not to di&s;&s;emble. <HI>Lucilla</HI> he&s;i|tated
what &s;he ought to reply,
and her embarra&s;ment denoted
&s;ome my&s;tery &s;he was unwilling
to explain.</P>
<P>SHE could no longer re&s;i&s;t the
importunity of <HI>Alberti,</HI> or avoid
relating the hi&s;tory of <HI>Julia.</HI>
&mdash;Surprized and &s;hocked at the
thought of what &s;he had &s;uffered
through his per&s;ecution, angui&s;h
overwhelmed his &s;pirits.&mdash;What
exqui&s;ite di&s;tre&s;s had you &s;pared
me, &s;aid <HI>Alberti,</HI> when his words
could find a pa&s;&s;age, had you
&s;ooner judged me worthy of con|fidence.
Witne&s;s to the birth
of my pa&s;&s;ion, you knew the im|po&s;&s;ibility
of its &s;ucce&s;s; yet
<PB N="130" REF="132">
would not endeavour to &s;top the
cour&s;e of a torrent that hurls me
down the precipice of life! Ad|ding
&s;ome &s;evere reproaches to
the&s;e words.&mdash;Torn with love,
jealou&s;y, de&s;pair,&mdash;he left <HI>Lucil|la</HI>
abruptly, &s;o di&s;ordered, he was
obliged to be put to bed: a burn|ing
fever en&s;ued which in a few
days reduced him to the la&s;t ex|tremity.
He died tenderly re|gretted
by his worthy &s;on, and
the re&s;t of his friends.</P>
<P>WHILST they paid the tribute
of tears to the memory of <HI>Alberti,</HI>
the unfortunate, but innocent
cau&s;e of his death, quitted the
hovel where &s;he had been &s;hel|tered
&s;everal days, in a pilgrim's
attire, fir&s;t gratifiying her kind
ho&s;ts with all the money &s;he
could &s;pare, and reque&s;ting the
conveyance of a letter to <HI>Lucilla,</HI>
<PB N="131" REF="133">
relating her di&s;a&s;trous adventure,
and her re&s;olution to travel out
of the reach of her enemies.&mdash;
She then took the road to <HI>Bou|logna,</HI>
intending to proceed from
thence to <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Venice,</HI> ho|ping
in one of the&s;e cities to be
&s;o fortunate as to find her father,
or at lea&s;t to meet with &s;ome of
his friends, whom re&s;pect to his
worth might induce to place her
in a convent, till &s;he could ap|pear
in the world with &s;ecuri|ty.</P>
<P>HER thoughts were &s;till oc|cupied
with the four ma&s;qued ad|venturers;
and after an infinite
variety of conjectures, &s;he at
length thought it mu&s;t be an ex|ploit
of the Marquis <HI>Strozzi's,</HI>
de&s;cended from one of the fir&s;t
families in <HI>Florence.</HI> This no|bleman
was ju&s;t returned from
<PB N="132" REF="134">
making the tour of <HI>Europe,</HI> and
had expre&s;&s;ed an extravagant ad|miration
of <HI>Julia,</HI> far &s;urpa&s;&s;ing
the common emotions excited by
beauty. He had merit, was
brave and enterprizing; and &s;e|veral
of his adventures &s;he had
heard recounted, confirmed this
character; be&s;ides he was a <HI>Flo|rentine,</HI>
and had little to appre|hend
from the con&s;equence of
offering violence to a &s;tranger,
who&s;e di&s;tance from her country
deprived her of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
relations to revenge the outrage.
&mdash;The&s;e con&s;iderations bid her
to believe the ravi&s;her could be
no other than <HI>Strozzi.</HI></P>
<P>JULIA's per&s;on was com|pletely
elegant, that the habit of
a pilgrim could not prevent her
being regarded with inqui&s;itive
applau&s;e by all &s;pectators.&mdash;
<PB N="133" REF="135">
She had cut her hair like the
men; it fell in loo&s;e curls on her
&s;houlders, but the &s;corching rays
of the &s;un were unable to alter
the beauty of its colour; or that
of the delicate complexion it
&s;haded.&mdash;She was obliged to
make &s;hort &s;tages, as her con&s;ti|tution
was too tender to endure
long ones without fatigue; and
having pa&s;&s;ed <HI>Ficre&s;ol</HI> on the great
<HI>Appenine</HI> road, &s;he drew near
<HI>Bologna,</HI> when &s;he was delighted
with the entrance into a plea&s;ant
wood, and to find the air per|fumed
with orange and myrtle
trees. The &s;un was &s;etting.&mdash;
The gentle murmur of a rivulet,
who&s;e banks were bordered with
turf, invited her to repo&s;e, and
furni&s;hed a bed as commodious
as &s;he could expect, under the
&s;hade of a &s;preading tree, who&s;e
root &s;erved for a pillow, whil&s;t
<PB N="134" REF="136">
the great hat the pilgrims wear,
formed a kind of umbrella.&mdash;
<HI>Julia,</HI> faint and weary, &s;unk into
the arms of &s;leep. Two circum|&s;tances
&s;oon cau&s;ed her to wake
in the utmo&s;t agony and &s;urprize:
&mdash;the &s;en&s;ation of pain on find|ing
her leg pierced with an ar|row,
was mingled with terror at
the &s;ound of horns, and the cry
of dogs and hunt&s;men.&mdash;She
&s;hrieked with angui&s;h, and was
e&s;&s;aying to extract the point of
the arrow, when &s;he beheld three
ladies mounted on fine hor&s;es;
the gallantry of their dre&s;s and
appearance, &s;u&s;pended for a &s;hort
&s;pace the torture of her wound,
in the admiration they excited.
A bow fa&s;tened to her girdle,
and a quiver of arrows at her
&s;houlder, gave the principal fair
one, the air of <HI>Diana</HI> attended
by her nymphs.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="137">
IN the mo&s;t charming accent
&s;he expre&s;&s;ed her grief and vex|ation,
on &s;ight of the pilgrim
wounded by her own arrow!&mdash;
By what unhappy fatality, &s;he ex|claimed,
have I been driven to
commit this cruel action, when
I was only di&s;playing the dexte|rity
of my aim to the&s;e ladies?
Never &s;urely were two per&s;ons
&s;o unfortunate! The pity you
be&s;tow, madam, &s;aid <HI>Julia</HI> in a
langui&s;hing tone of voice, is ca|pable
of a&s;&s;waging the angui&s;h of
the wound you have given! I
fear it affords little comfort in
the &s;ituation to which I have re|duced
you, to a&s;&s;ure you my com|pa&s;&s;ion
is &s;trongly moved, replied
the lady, and as the fir&s;t &s;tep to|wards
attonement for my inno|cent
crime, I entreat you will
con&s;ent to be removed to my
hou&s;e till your cure is perfected.
<PB N="136" REF="138">
She immediately ordered one of
her gentlemen to bind up the
pilgrim's wound, and convey him
in a chai&s;e to the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>JULIA, in her de&s;ponding
&s;tate, could &s;ee nothing more e|ligible
than what was propo&s;ed;
thanking her for her generous
care, &s;he, by the help of her at|tendant,
got into the chai&s;e.&mdash;
He acquainted her on the way,
that his lady was lately married;
&mdash;that &s;he belonged to the hou&s;e
of <HI>Becarelli,</HI> very con&s;iderable
in <HI>Bologna;</HI> that &s;he was an only
child, and her father, regretting
the extinction of an illu&s;trious
name, re&s;olved to choo&s;e a &s;on-in-law,
who would adopt that
and his arms: to which he had
added an immen&s;e fortune.&mdash;
That the marqui&s;s of <HI>Becarelli,</HI>
her hu&s;band's title, had been
<PB N="137" REF="139">
&s;ome time from home, and that
the huntre&s;&s;es in her party were
relations and neighbours, fond of
tho&s;e diver&s;ions &s;uitable to their
rank.</P>
<P>HE then interrogated <HI>Julia</HI>
where &s;he was travelling; ex|cu&s;e
me &s;ir, continued he, if I
&s;ay you appear too much above
your habit, that though I never
&s;aw you before, I am per&s;uaded
you are a man of quality.&mdash;It
is of no con&s;equence what I am,
replied <HI>Julia,</HI> but to &s;atisfy your
enquiry, I will inform you my
name is <HI>Silvis,</HI> that I am going
to <HI>Loretto;</HI>&mdash;and that fortune
has placed me in a condition to
have nothing more to fear.&mdash;
You let me into the &s;ecret in a
few words, continued the atten|dant,
but per&s;ons to whom na|ture
has been &s;o lavi&s;h, can, I
<PB N="138" REF="140">
&s;hould imagine, have no real
cau&s;e for that fixed melancholy
ob&s;ervable in your countenance.
Here the chai&s;e &s;topped, and the
&s;tranger was led into a magni|ficient
appartment.</P>
<P>THE marchione&s;s's valet de
chambre who was a good &s;ur|geon,
dre&s;&s;ed <HI>Silvis's</HI> leg, for &s;o
I &s;hall call him at pre&s;ent.&mdash;
The arrow had glanced along the
&s;urface, &s;o as to occa&s;ion acute
pain, but had not entered deep
enough for any danger to be ap|prehended.
When the marchi|one&s;s
and the two ladies return|ed,
they ha&s;tened to the pilgrim's
chamber; her gentleman re|counted
the conver&s;ation between
them, and &s;he &s;ub&s;cribed the
ju&s;tne&s;s of his remarks, that
there was &s;omething noble and
commanding in <HI>Silvis's</HI> phy&s;iog|&s;iognomy,
<PB N="139" REF="141">
that &s;poke him a per|&s;on
of di&s;tinction. She &s;tayed
but a &s;hort time; yet the idea
of the lovely pilgrim played round
her heart in &s;uch a manner &s;he
got no &s;leep all the night, and
under the pretext of charity, re|newed
her vi&s;it early in the mor|ning.</P>
<P>ARE you more ea&s;y? &s;aid &s;he,
in the mo&s;t obliging manner,
and have you pardoned the in|jury
I have been guilty of?&mdash;
Madam, an&s;wered <HI>Silvis,</HI> were
you more acquainted with my
di&s;po&s;ition, you would not be|lieve
&s;o flight a wound could rai&s;e
my re&s;entment. I prote&s;t, on
the contrary, I e&s;teem it a hap|pine&s;s
to receive it from &s;o fair a
hand. The marchione&s;s affected
inattention to the gallantry of a
compliment which penetrated her
<PB N="140" REF="142">
very &s;oul; and &s;eemed to indi|cate
&s;he had not made a &s;lighter

on her's.</P>
<P>HAVE you ever &s;een any thing
half &s;o charming <HI>Eugenia?</HI> &s;aid
&s;he to a favourite maid in whom
&s;he confided. Did you ob&s;erve
with what fond expre&s;&s;ion the
young <HI>Silvis</HI> regarded me?&mdash;I
read his heart, and the agitation
he has thrown mine into is too
alarming for me to run the hazard
of &s;eeing him again. She &s;o far
conquered her inclination as to
refrain vi&s;iting <HI>Silvis</HI> for &s;everal
days; feigning not to be well,
to avoid &s;u&s;picion of the cau&s;e;
but ab&s;ent from her &s;ight, he was
&s;till pre&s;ent in her imaginati|on.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="143">
SHE &s;ought to indulge her me|lancholy

had been weeping.</P>
<P>THIS &s;he attributed to grief
for her ab&s;ence. Her boa&s;ted
&s;elf-denial was over&s;et the mo|ment
&s;he was flattered with a
tender &s;hare in his remembrance,
and her heart irrecoverably lo&s;t.
What is it di&s;turbs you <HI>Silvis?</HI>
&s;he began, you &s;eem oppre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="142" REF="144">
with &s;orrow! Madam, &s;aid he, I
am not yet &s;o familiar with afflic|tion

me;&mdash;my misfortunes always
appear new! But, re&s;umed the
marchione&s;s, are you not ingeni|ous
in &s;eeking them your&s;elf?&mdash;
O, no, replied the pilgrim. Fate
has cru&s;hed me with woes un|&s;ought,
and I confe&s;s, madam, I
no longer li&s;ten to the flatterer,
hope!</P>
<P>HERE they both fell into a
profound reverie.&mdash;The mar|chione&s;s
viewing all things

&mdash;Whil&s;t <HI>Silvis,</HI> regardle&s;s of
the deep-fetched &s;ighs of the

the peculiar &s;everity of a con|finement

<PB N="143" REF="145">
able to renew the conver&s;ation,
the fair marchione&s;s retired in
apparent di&s;compo&s;ure. Con|vinced
<HI>Silvis</HI> was infinitely dear
to her, &s;en&s;ibility encrea&s;ed her
affliction.</P>
<P>WHICH ever way I turn, the
cour&s;e of reflection, &s;aid &s;he to
<HI>Eugenia,</HI> I find only fre&s;h &s;ub|jects
for di&s;tre&s;s.&mdash;The mo&s;t
poignant of all, is the weakne&s;s
of my own heart.&mdash;If I have
re&s;igned my fate to the direction
of another,&mdash;every &s;igh I rob
him of, is an injury to my fame,
and a breach of connubial duty:
&mdash;con&s;ider, my dear <HI>Eugenia,</HI>
how many di&s;graceful circum|&s;tances
attend this infatuation.
&mdash;I am ignorant who <HI>Silvis</HI> is,
&mdash;a &s;tranger whom I meet with
in a pilgrim's dre&s;s;&mdash;perhaps
of ignoble de&s;cent;&mdash;perhaps
<PB N="144" REF="146">
worthy the preference I give him.
&mdash;One thing alone is certain,&mdash;
he will &s;oon depart,&mdash;no more to
return!&mdash;Ah; fatal arrow,&mdash;
the wound thou gave&s;t will
quickly be healed! But that
which this too amiable un|known,
has imprinted on my
heart, is, alas! incurable!</P>
<P>SOME days pa&s;&s;ed without a
renewal of her vi&s;its; but as <HI>Sil|vis</HI>
began to walk tolerably, he
thought it his duty to wait on
the marchione&s;s; and could not
avoid remarking the alternate
changes of colour whil&s;t he ac|co&s;ted
her; he feared &s;he was ill,
but re&s;pect kept him &s;ilent. She
obliged him to &s;it,&mdash;and after re|garding
him attentively for &s;ome
moments, I fear we &s;hall not
prevail with you to &s;tay with us
much longer <HI>Silvis,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, you
<PB N="145" REF="147">
will &s;oon be in a &s;ituation to tra|vel;
but may I not hope before

<P>MADAM, replied <HI>Silvis,</HI> I am
an unfortunate man, unde&s;erving
the obliging curio&s;ity you are
plea&s;ed to expre&s;s;&mdash;my birth
and fortune equally contracted.
&mdash;The meanne&s;s of my ap|pearance
&s;ufficiently indicates
that of my condition.&mdash;The
little you reveal, rejoined the
marchione&s;s, implies there is
much more to be known.&mdash;If
your rank an&s;wers the dignity of
your appearance,&mdash;not many are
&s;uperior!&mdash;but &s;ince you may
have rea&s;ons for not revealing
your quality, at lea&s;t favour me

<P>THE recollection of pa&s;t hap|pine&s;s,

<P>AH <HI>Silvis!</HI> &s;aid the marchio|ne&s;s

appearances are not very deceit|ful,

of my folly, you dread the
&s;trength of your own attach|ment?
But fly, charming <HI>Sil|vis,</HI>
fly! I con&s;ent to it.&mdash;Your
pre&s;ence only augments my woes.
&mdash;Perhaps in cea&s;ing to be|hold,
&mdash;I may cea&s;e to love you!
&mdash;A flood of tears that could no
<PB N="148" REF="150">

to remain &s;ome hours in her clo|&s;et,
nor did <HI>Silvis</HI> &s;eek any occa|&s;ion
to &s;ee or &s;peak to her of
&s;ome days;&mdash;but finding her
wound perfectly cured, he &s;ought
the marchione&s;s to take his hum|ble
leave,&mdash;and thank her in the
mo&s;t grateful terms for her hu|mane
behaviour; adding that
the be&s;t te&s;timony he could &s;hew
of his gratitude, would be to
publi&s;h in all places where fate
&s;hould lead him, that her gene|ro&s;ity
was equal to her merit and
beauty.</P>
<P>THE marchione&s;s exerted all
her fortitude to conceal the vio|lence
of her emotions in this
cruel moment.&mdash;Go&mdash;<HI>Silvis,</HI> &s;aid
&s;he, accompli&s;h your vows;&mdash;
be a&s;&s;ured mine &s;hall be ince&s;|&s;antly
poured forth for your fe|licity!
<PB N="149" REF="151">
Saying he &s;hould &s;et out
the next morning at day-break,
after again repeating his thanks,
he left the marchione&s;s.</P>
<P>THE night was &s;ultry,&mdash;
without undre&s;&s;ing, <HI>Silvis</HI> had
thrown her&s;elf acro&s;s the bed,
hoping by a &s;hort &s;leep, to be
more able to travel in the morn|ing:
but the young marchione&s;s
could not re&s;olve to let him de|part,
without &s;aying once more
adieu! She went &s;ilently out of
her bed-chamber; the &s;plendor
of a moonlight night, rendered
a candle unnece&s;&s;ary; and per|haps
the reflexion that her blu&s;hes
would be concealed, &s;hould &s;he
not be able to re&s;train &s;ome ten|der
expre&s;&s;ions, induced her not
to take one; &s;he al&s;o was tempted
to pre&s;ent him with her picture;
that &s;o endearing an evidence of
her regard, might bind her more
<PB N="150" REF="152">
forcibly not to forget her.&mdash;
The curtains of the bed were
drawn up in &s;e&s;toons. <HI>Silvis</HI> was
fa&s;t a&s;leep, his hair in graceful
negligence, &s;haded his cheeks,
and his exqui&s;ite beauty recalled
to the marchione&s;s's remem|brance
the idea of <HI>Cupid,</HI> when
the imprudent <HI>P&s;yche</HI> gratified
her fatal curio&s;ity. Ah <HI>Silvis,</HI>
&s;aid &s;he, pa&s;&s;ionately regarding
him, wert thou really enamoured,
could&s;t thou enjoy &s;uch tranquil
&s;lumbers on the eve of our &s;epa|ration?
Can it be po&s;&s;ible, that
in the moment thou art preparing
my la&s;ting angui&s;h, thou remain|e&s;t
calm and undi&s;turbed? Not
daring to wake him, &s;he hung o|ver
him &startq;with looks of cordial
love,&endq; whil&s;t the pale light
that glanced through the win|dows
&s;erved to di&s;cern the un|paralleled
charms of the lovely
<PB N="151" REF="153">
&s;tranger.&mdash;What in nature is
there half &s;o perfect? &s;he ex|claimed
in the &s;ofte&s;t tone of ad|miration.
&mdash;Language fails in the
de&s;cription of thy beauty! who
can re&s;i&s;t its attraction!</P>
<P>THUS intoxicated with that
in&s;idious pa&s;&s;ion which glided
imperceptibly through all her
veins, &s;he dropped the miniature
painting into <HI>Silvis's</HI> pocket, an|ticipating
his plea&s;ing &s;urprize
at finding an unhoped for favour,
&s;o ine&s;timably dear. She was
ju&s;t going to withdraw, when,
impelled by the violence of her
pa&s;&s;ion, &s;he could not forbear
pre&s;&s;ing his lips with a parting
ki&s;s, and throwing her arm round
him, &s;unk on his brea&s;t in a &s;tate
of forgetfulne&s;s.&mdash;But, O <HI>God!</HI>
what were her emotions when
&s;he felt the &s;troke of a poinard,
and recognized the face of her
<PB N="152" REF="154">
hu&s;band, the Marqui&s;s <HI>Becarelli'</HI>
who only quitted her to wreak
his vengeance on <HI>Silvis;</HI> &s;tarting
at the noi&s;e, and terrified with
the impending danger, he en|deavoured
to fly,&mdash;which the en|raged
marqui&s;s prevented by
&s;tabbing him in the arm; and
preparing to repeat the blow&punc;
the two gentlemen who accom|panied
him interpo&s;ed, a&s;king if
he recollected the plan they had
formed, which would be fru&s;|trated
by his ra&s;hne&s;s? They
then dragged <HI>Silvis</HI> up the &s;tairs
of a tower, and fa&s;tened the
door.</P>
<P>THE unhappy marchione&s;s,
fainting and weltering in the
blood that gu&s;hed from her
wound, was ordered by the mar|qui&s;s
to be conveyed and con|fined
with rigid &s;everity in her
<PB N="153" REF="155">
apartment. It is not ea&s;y to con|ceive
the horror of her &s;ituation
le&s;s anxious for her own fate, than
for his &s;he loved, trembling le&s;t
her hu&s;band &s;hould have &s;acri|ficed
an innocent victim to the
tran&s;ports of jealous fury; yet,
however impatient her de&s;ire of
information, forbearing to gra|tify
it from the fear of having
her apprehen&s;ions confirmed;&mdash;
and a repugnance to tru&s;t any of
her &s;ervants, by &s;ome of whom
&s;he knew &s;he had been betrayed.
Nor was this &s;ugge&s;tion a mi&s;|taken
one:&mdash;<HI>Eugenia,</HI> that girl
who had her unre&s;erved confi|dence,
was &s;educed by the mar|qui&s;s,
no impracticable attempt
when promi&s;es and pecuniary re|wards
are employed, to in&s;pect
the conduct of the marchione&s;s
during his ab&s;ence. He enjoined
<PB N="154" REF="156">
her to write him a regular ac|count
of all that pa&s;&s;ed, which
&s;he had been punctual in per|forming,
not omitting a &s;yllable
of all her mi&s;tre&s;s's encomiums
on <HI>Silvis,</HI> and the extravagance
of her pa&s;&s;ion. Irritated to the
greate&s;t degree, the marqui&s;s &s;e|cretly
arrived, and <HI>Eugenia</HI> dex|trou&s;ly
concealed him for two
days, till he could meet with an
opportunity to detect his wife
with her gallant.</P>
<P>HIS fir&s;t de&s;ign was to have
her &s;hut up in a religious hou&s;e$
and to obtain an order for taking
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her e&s;tate, and for
criminal pro&s;ecution again&s;t <HI>Sil|vis.</HI>
&mdash;But, no longer ma&s;ter of
his re&s;entment, when he found
her lying by her lover's &s;ide, the
fir&s;t tran&s;ports of his wrath were
ungovernable. Impri&s;oned in a
<PB N="155" REF="157">
lonely tower, the wretched <HI>Julia,</HI>
&s;inking under pain and misfor|tune,
uncertain of her de&s;tiny;
&mdash;una&s;&s;i&s;ted by the kind hand of
humanity;&mdash;undetermined how
to act, was in a &s;tate &s;o deplo|rable,
as mu&s;t have awakened
pity in the brea&s;t of her mo&s;t bit|ter
enemy.&mdash;To reveal her &s;ex,
&s;eemed the mo&s;t infallible means
of ju&s;tifying the marchione&s;s,
and obtaining liberty.&mdash;On the
point of de&s;iring her guards to
acquaint the Marquifs <HI>Becarell$</HI>
&s;he reque&s;ted to &s;peak to him, a
&s;udden reflexion that the very ex|pedient
&s;he u&s;ed to prevent, might
ha&s;ten her de&s;truction, checked
her voice: &s;he feared the frantic
rage of a jealous hu&s;band who
had poinarded his wife, &s;hould,
when her innocence was demon|&s;trated,
puni&s;h the unhappy cau&s;e
of his error. That to avoid the
<PB N="156" REF="158">
re&s;entment of her family when
the affair was cleared up,&mdash;he
might be tempted to devote <HI>Ju|lia</HI>
to perpetual impri&s;onment.&mdash;
The&s;e apprehen&s;ions led her to
think it the &s;afe&s;t way to be de|livered
into the hands of ju&s;tice,
which would, at lea&s;t, free her
from the marqui&s;'s authority.</P>
<P>SHE pa&s;&s;ed a very wretched
night.&mdash;They had dre&s;&s;ed her
wound, and in &s;earching her
pockets, found the marchione&s;s's
picture, a fre&s;h proof of guilt.&mdash;
<HI>Julia</HI> was exce&s;&s;ively a&s;toni&s;hed,
at the &s;ight of a picture &s;he had
no knowledge of, any more than
by what method it came into her
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Early the next morn|ing,
&s;he was hurried into a
coach, and &s;urrounded by offi|cers
of ju&s;tice who in&s;ulted her
tears, as proofs of cowardice and
<PB N="157" REF="159">
timidity, conveyed to a pri&s;on in
<HI>Bologna:</HI> here &s;he gave vent to
her complaints.&mdash;Dear <HI>Hyp|hyppolitus,</HI>
&s;aid &s;he, with a deep
&s;igh, could fancy paint at this
very in&s;tant, your faithful <HI>Julia</HI>
loaded with irons,&mdash;in a pil|grim's
dre&s;s&mdash;a fugitive from the
gra&s;p of ruffians,&mdash;twice wound|ed!
&mdash;&s;tretched on the damp
floor of a dungeon! alas! what

Ah! rather ought I not to be|lieve

Ought I not indeed to be con|vinced
your cruel &s;ilence can
proceed from nothing but decay
of affection.&mdash;And mu&s;t I add
to all my other woes, the heartrending
idea that you love me no
more.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="160">
THE marchione&s;s was like|wi&s;e
conducted to <HI>Bologna,</HI> and,
notwith&s;tanding the pain her
wound occa&s;ioned, would actu|ally
have been carried to the pub|lic
pri&s;on, had not the influence
of her father, who&s;e birth and
fortune gave him great con&s;ide|ration
in the city, prevailed to
have her place of confinement
in a neighbouring ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>AN adventure &s;o extraordina|ry,&mdash;the
rank of the per&s;ons
concerned,&mdash;made a great noi&s;e
in the world:&mdash;each &s;ide had
its parti&s;ans; but what corrobo|rated
the allegations of the mar|qui&s;s
more than any other thing,
was the irre&s;i&s;table charms of
the fair pilgrim. Several ladies,
who&s;e curio&s;ity led them to the
pri&s;on, felt their hearts in du|rance;
<PB N="159" REF="161">
nor were there many
who&s;e di&s;po&s;itions were not as

of the fair marchione&s;s.</P>
<P>YET, though few doubted
the reality of the crime &s;he was
accu&s;ed of, the credit of her fa|ther
balanced the ju&s;tice of the
cau&s;e; and he had engaged the
opinion of the mo&s;t eminent
council, in favour of his daugh|ter.
Hearing &s;he would pro|bably
be acquitted, the marqui&s;s
was in the utmo&s;t perplexity;&mdash;
he was &s;en&s;ible the tryal would
go again&s;t him; unle&s;s his pro|ceedings
was &s;upported with pru|dence
and vigour, which com|menced
in a &s;torm of ra&s;h im|petuo&s;ity.
Under this embar|ra&s;ment,
a thought &s;truck him,
that he imagined might po&s;&s;ibly
<PB N="160" REF="162">
counteract the machinations a|gain&s;t
him,&mdash;he pre&s;ented a
petition that, to avoid any im|putation
of partiality, as he him|&s;elf
was a foreigner, the judges
&s;hould be half <HI>Italians,</HI> and the
other half of his own country;
a divi&s;ion equally ju&s;t and u&s;ual
in criminal cau&s;es. Count <HI>Ben|tivoglio</HI>
the governor of <HI>Bologna,</HI>
undertook to find out per&s;ons of
acknowledged integrity, and the
father of the marchione&s;s, as well
as her hu&s;band, depended ab&s;o|lutely
on his promi&s;e.</P>
<P>THE city waited impatiently
the event of this intere&s;ting tryal,
and the governor, in complai|&s;ance
to the marchione&s;s, ap|pointed
it at the ca&s;tle where &s;he
was impri&s;oned.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="163">
THE concour&s;e of people of

been &s;een on many occa&s;ions.&mdash;
The fair marchione&s;s was dre&s;&s;ed
in mourning, &s;uitable to the &s;o|lemnity

to her palene&s;s cau&s;ed by lo&s;s of
blood, as well as anxiety of mind.
Her beauty &s;hone under the
black cloud that &s;haded it; when
her father, venerably graceful as
unfortunate, led her into the
court, accompanied by the re&s;t
of his family.</P>
<P>SILVIS entered at another door
bending under the weight of fet|ters,
which even in this deplo|rable
&s;tate, all beholders thought
him more formed to impo&s;e than
to wear! Both ca&s;t them&s;elves in
a &s;upplicating attitude, their
eyes &s;treaming with tears, at the
<PB N="162" REF="164">
feet of their judges. I mean not
le&s;s to appeal to your ju&s;tice, &s;aid
the marchione&s;s, than to implore
your pity.&mdash;Alas, gentlemen,
I am unfortunate without being
guilty! I call <HI>Heaven</HI> to wit|ne&s;s
my innocence! he who ac|cu&s;es
me with &s;o much virulence

thunder&s;truck with his voice,
and lifting her eyes with terror

trembled,&mdash;and, at la&s;t, fainted.
Every one ran to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance&punc;
particularly a &s;tranger, one of
her judges,&mdash;who in&s;tantly re|collecting
her features, embraced

<P>JULIA, tran&s;ported beyond
her accu&s;tomed moderation, &s;u|perior
to that timidity the &s;ight
of the earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> had at fir&s;t
in&s;pired, declared in an audible
voice, &s;he was the daughter of
the earl of <HI>Warwick.</HI>&mdash;The
judges immediately ro&s;e, and a
confu&s;ed murmur of acclamations
<PB N="166" REF="168">
&s;ucceeded;&mdash;but was &s;oon hu&s;h|ed
into profound &s;ilence, when
waving her hand, &s;he added, that
the earl of <HI>Bedford,</HI> the per&s;ecu|tor
and hu&s;band of the Marchio|ne&s;s
<HI>Becarelli,</HI> was likewi&s;e her
hu&s;band, and con&s;equently had
two wives. A fact he could not
deny.</P>
<P>THUS the whole cour&s;e of the
pro&s;ecution was changed, in fa|vour
of the two ladies, who now
entered a proce&s;s again&s;t the earl
of <HI>Bedford.</HI></P>
<P>THE earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> and
Signior <HI>Becarelli,</HI> demanded of
Count <HI>Bentivoglio,</HI> that the earl
of <HI>Bedford's</HI> per&s;on might be &s;e|cured;
which, conformable to
the laws of the country, was
complied with, and the earl con|conducted
<PB N="167" REF="169">
to pri&s;on.&mdash;The par|ticulars
he related, were as fol|lows:</P>
<P>&startq;THAT believing <HI>Julia</HI> dead,
from the letter wrote by the
abbe&s;s of St. <HI>Menoux,</HI> he left
<HI>England</HI> with an intention to
travel; beginning with <HI>Italy,</HI>
as a part of the world where
he had many relations on his
mother's &s;ide, with whom he
wi&s;hed to be acquainted:&mdash;
Signior <HI>Beccarelli</HI> being of the
number, he went to vi&s;it him
at <HI>Bologna;</HI> where he &s;aw
Signiora <HI>Becarelli,</HI> his daugh|ter,
and became di&s;tractedly
in love;&mdash;his &s;olicitations
gained her father's con&s;ent, on
condition of taking the name
and arms of his family.&mdash;
That &s;ometime after his mar|marriage,
<PB N="168" REF="170">
he went with his
father-in-law to <HI>Florence,</HI>
where, one day at ve&s;pers, he
beheld <HI>Lucilla,</HI> accompanied
by a lady in a widow's dre&s;s,
whom he &s;oon di&s;covered to
be <HI>Julia,</HI> and thought he mu&s;t
have dropped from his &s;eat at
a rencounter &s;o marvelous and
unexpected; that unwilling
to acquaint Signior <HI>Becarelli</HI>
with &s;o unfortunate an event,
he applied his indu&s;try in cor|rupting
a dome&s;tick of Sena|tor
<HI>Alberti's,</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the
execution of a project he had
formed: that he afterwards
returned to <HI>Bologna,</HI> where he
remained &s;ome time with the
marchione&s;s, but with a mind
re&s;tle&s;s and apprehen&s;ive left
<HI>Julia</HI> &s;hould, by &s;ome unlucky
chance, be informed of his &s;e|cond
<PB N="169" REF="171">
engagement, and take
advantage of it to revenge the
confinement he had made her
endure.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;THAT the&s;e con&s;iderati|ons
prompted him to leave
the city, after fir&s;t &s;ecuring a
reception for <HI>Julia</HI> in a con|vent
near <HI>Sienna,</HI> where he
intended to have &s;hut her up
for life: but receiving intelli|gence
from the &s;ervant in his
pay, that he had not a mo|ment
to lo&s;e in eloping with the
fair <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> lady, who&s;e lover
he concluded he was, becau&s;e
his ma&s;ter, <HI>Alberti,</HI> had com|manded
him to be ready that
very night, to take her out of
her apartment by force&mdash;
That on this information he
repaired with a party of his
<PB N="170" REF="172">
&s;ervants ma&s;qued, and finding
the garden gate open, through
means of his emi&s;&s;ary, placed
his wife in the coach without
mole&s;tation. But their flight
being &s;oon retarded by the
pur&s;uit of <HI>Alberti,</HI> he faced
the enemy, and received a pi&s;|tol
&s;hot that made it nece&s;&s;ary
for him to &s;top at <HI>Sienna;</HI>
where he con&s;tantly heard what
pa&s;&s;ed at his own hou&s;e from
<HI>Eugenia,</HI> whom he employed as
a &s;py on the marchione&s;s's
conduct: from her he learnt
that the marchione&s;s was
&s;trangely captivated with a
hand&s;ome pilgrim whom &s;he
had lodged in the ca&s;tle, and
that enraged with &s;o gro&s;s an
indignity, he was incapable of
controuling his re&s;entment.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="173">
IN this de&s;olate &s;tate, a prey
to rage and jealou&s;y, the earl was
&s;eized with a violent fever,
who&s;e fir&s;t &s;ymptoms were ex|tremely
unfavourable.&mdash;The
wound received in the &s;kirmi&s;h,
and which impatience to puni&s;h
the imaginary wrong done to his
honour, made him neglect, broke
out again.</P>
<P>BUT whil&s;t he was thus tor|mented,
the earl of <HI>Warwick,
Hyppolitus,</HI> and <HI>Julia,</HI> ta&s;ted all
the &s;atisfaction that can be con|ceived
in a &s;ituation &s;o agreeable
to their wi&s;hes. The happy pair
reciprocally recounted their me|lancholy
adventures, mutually
&s;hedding tears for each others
&s;ufferings, and hardly per&s;uading
them&s;elves to credit the reality
of their pre&s;ent happine&s;s. No
<PB N="172" REF="174">
words, my dear <HI>Julia,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Hyp|politus,</HI>
can give you the lea&s;t
idea of the agonizing torture I
endured by the fatal report of
your death.&mdash;To follow you
to the grave was the on$y hope I
indulged; and it has always ap|peared
to me &s;ince, that my de|termined
re&s;olution to &s;eek death
in every place where danger
pointed, was the true rea&s;on that,
like a coward he fled my pur|&s;uit;
for I never received one
wound in the numerous engage|ments
in the &s;ervice of the knights
of <HI>Malta.</HI> De&s;pairing therefore
of dying in the cau&s;e of religion,
and finding no diminution of my
&s;orrow, from the effects of time,
I re&s;olved to pay a vi&s;it to my
&s;i&s;ter, from the melancholy mo|tive
of repeating with one who
loved her memory, the mourn|ful
<PB N="173" REF="175">
tale of fond affection? I
acquainted my two friends with
my intention. The earl of <HI>War|wick</HI>
would accompany me, as
our honour was engaged to re|new
the campaign, but as he had
been wounded in &s;everal actions,
re&s;t was judged indi&s;pen&s;ibly ne|ce&s;&s;ary
for his health.</P>
<P>As to Lord <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> letters from
the counte&s;s of <HI>Northampton,</HI> in|&s;pired
him with hopes that their
union would not be much longer
retarded; and the &s;incerity of
his pa&s;&s;ion urged him in&s;tantly
to embark for <HI>England.</HI> The
earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> and I, remained
at <HI>Venice,</HI> till he thought him|&s;elf
&s;ufficiently recruited; but
the exerci&s;e of a carriage made
him &s;o much wor&s;e, he was o|bliged
to &s;top in this city, where
<PB N="174" REF="176">
we &s;oon were vi&s;ited by Count
<HI>Bentivoglio:</HI> and as the Marqui&s;s
<HI>Becarelli's</HI> adventure was the ge|neral
topick of conver&s;ation, and
attended with intricate circum|&s;tances,
he brought us daily
&s;omething new relating to one or
other of the parties.&mdash;Alas!
could I ever have thought that
that pilgrim loaded with chains
in a horrible dungeon, was my
dear <HI>Julia!</HI> for whom my tears
flowed ince&s;&s;antly. By the care
of providence, however, the Mar|qui&s;s
<HI>Becarelli,</HI> or more properly
the earl of <HI>Bedford,</HI> was induced
to demand, part of the judges
might be <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> to counterba|lance
the partiality of the <HI>Italians.</HI>
The governor reque&s;ted us to be
of the number. Strange turn of
fate, that I, of all men, &s;hould
be appointed to &s;it in judgment
<PB N="175" REF="177">
on the earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> and you.&mdash;
You, whom I revere as my &s;o|vereign,
and him whom I a&s;|&s;uredly
regard as my mortal e|nemy!</P>
<P>THE re&s;t madam, you know;
&mdash;but what you can never &s;uf|ficiently
comprehend is, the joy,
&mdash;the &s;atisfaction,&mdash;the rapture
I have felt, ever &s;ince that for|tunate
incident!</P>
<P>JULIA an&s;wered the&s;e effu|&s;ions
of a worthy heart, with the
mo&s;t charming frankne&s;s; and
&s;aid every thing to convince
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> of her invariable at|tachment,
and ju&s;t &s;en&s;ibility of
a pa&s;&s;ion &s;o con&s;tant and ten|der.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="178">
How &s;hall I de&s;cribe the con|fu&s;ion
and grief of the marchi|one&s;s
<HI>Becarellli,</HI> when beholding
<HI>Julia,</HI> &s;he could not forget her
weakne&s;s for <HI>Silvis?</HI> That ideal
charmer reigned &s;o de&s;potically
in her heart, &s;he was truly an
object of commi&s;eration!&mdash;I
blu&s;h to confe&s;s to you, addre&s;|&s;ing
<HI>Julia,</HI> that I have &s;uffered
more angui&s;h from the annihila|tion
of <HI>Silvis,</HI> than from all the
misfortunes of my life.&mdash;For
though I firmly re&s;olved to &s;ee
him no more, and preferred death
to di&s;honour. There was a &s;a|tisfaction
in reflecting he exi&s;ted
in &s;ome part of the world, and
that we might one day meet a|gain.
But this di&s;covery renders
my &s;ingular calamity irremedi|able.
I am con&s;umed by the ar|dour
of a chimerical flame!&mdash;
<PB N="177" REF="179">
Indeed, my dear marchione&s;s,
interrupted <HI>Julia,</HI> you will find
my heart di&s;po&s;ed to give you all
its friend&s;hip, and I &s;incerely a&s;|&s;ure
you <HI>Silvis</HI> did not love you
half &s;o well as <HI>Julia</HI> does!&mdash;
The fair <HI>Italian</HI> was unable to
reply but by her &s;ighs:&mdash;&s;he
regarded <HI>Julia</HI> with looks ex|pre&s;&s;ive
of de&s;pair, and left the
room drowned in tears.</P>
<P>THE proceedings again&s;t the
earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> were carried on
with &s;uch vigour by the two no|blemen,
that he already began to
tremble for the decree; which
encrea&s;ed his malady to &s;o great a
degree, that he was reduced to
the la&s;t extremity.</P>
<P>ON his information, re&s;ent|ment
in&s;tantly &s;ub&s;iding in the
<PB N="178" REF="180">
brea&s;t of his two wives, was &s;uc|ceeded
by pity. They had him
carefully removed to the ca&s;tle,
and forgetting all their wrongs,
exerted them&s;elves in performing
the duties of humanity in his la&s;t
moments, with a zeal and at|tention
&s;ingularly generous and
noble.</P>
<P>HE expired a martyr to the
extravagance of his pa&s;&s;ions; and
&s;oon after the Marchione&s;s <HI>Be|carelli</HI>
took an eternal leave of
her beloved <HI>Julia.</HI>&mdash;I am going,
&s;aid &s;he, to &s;eparate my&s;elf from
you for ever; &s;ince I cannot be
your's, I never will be another's.
&mdash;But will bury my &s;hame,
and my unhappy pa&s;&s;ion in a
convent!</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="181">
JULIA repeatedly pre&s;&s;ed her
to abandon this gloomy re&s;olu|tion.
&mdash;She remained inflexi|ble,,
and was leaving her apart|ment,&mdash;when,
ha&s;tily return|ing,
do not refu&s;e my la&s;t re|que&s;t?
Let me once more be|hold
my conqueror? Re&s;ume
for a moment the habit that
charmed me?</P>
<P>As <HI>Julia</HI> was alone, and thought
none but them&s;elves would &s;ee
what pa&s;&s;ed, &s;he was complai|&s;ant
enough to indulge her re|que&s;t;
and, &s;tepping into her
clo&s;et, &s;oon appeared in her pil|grim's
dre&s;s to the marchione&s;s,
who was all impatience: the
fir&s;t glance occa&s;ioned &s;o violent
a tremour, &s;he was near faint|ing.&mdash;Alas!
&s;he exclaimed, I
find it a poi&s;on, where I &s;ought a
<PB N="180" REF="182">
remedy! <HI>Silvis,</HI> adorable <HI>Sil|vis!</HI>
Thou no longer exi&s;te&s;t
but in my heart! All that now
appears of thee, I regard as a
mere phantom, that neither flat|ters
nor cures my pa&s;&s;ion!</P>
<P>WITH the&s;e words &s;he ro&s;e
&s;uddenly, and proceeded to the
convent &s;he had cho&s;en for her
retreat; where &s;oon after, un|moved
by the gentle entreaties
of her di&s;tre&s;&s;ed father, &s;he took
the veil.</P>
<P>THE earl of <HI>Warwick, Hyppo|litus,</HI>
and <HI>Julia,</HI> having heard of
the death of <HI>Alberti,</HI> pur&s;ued
their journey to <HI>Florence,</HI> where
the mourning in which they
found their friends, gave place to
delightful &s;en&s;ations of joy, at
the &s;ight that was deare&s;t to them
<PB N="181" REF="183">
on earth! <HI>Lucilla</HI> &s;eemed quite
frantic; whil&s;t &s;he embraced her
<HI>Julia!</HI> The con&s;tant anxiety
that preyed upon her mind, ig|norant
of the fate of <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI>
and her friend, had interrupted
the &s;weetne&s;s of that harmony
&s;he enjoyed with a hu&s;band of
uncommon merit.</P>
<P>LEANDER and <HI>Lucilla</HI> petiti|oned
the earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> no
longer to defer completing the
the happine&s;s of their amiable
friends, who&s;e nuptials were &s;o|lemnized
at <HI>Leander's</HI> country &s;eat
Never did <HI>Phoebus</HI> gild a more

in&s;pire two lovers with a

his torch with greater compla|cency
than to reward that con|&s;tancy
<PB N="182" REF="184">
which remained invinca|ble
to the &s;evere&s;t trials.</P>
<P>THEIR arrival in <HI>England</HI> was
celebrated with every demon|&s;tration
of joy.&mdash;They found
the earl of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> married to the
