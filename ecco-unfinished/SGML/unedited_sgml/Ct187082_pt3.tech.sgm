<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Pleadings of Pity.</HEAD>
<P>TO oblige Mr. Tyrold, who had made the arrange|ment
with Sir Hugh, Eugenia con&s;ented to dine and
&s;pend the day at Etherington, which &s;he quitted at
night in a temper of mind perfectly compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Camilla was deeply penetrated by the whole of this
affair. The &s;ufferings, &s;o utterly unearned by fault
or by folly, of a &s;i&s;ter &s;o dear to her, and the affecting
fortitude which, &s;o quickly upon her wounds, and at
&s;o early a period of life, &s;he already began to di&s;play,
made her blu&s;h at the dejection into which &s;he was her|&s;elf
ca&s;t by every evil, and re&s;olve to become in future
more worthy of the father and the &s;i&s;ter, who at this
moment ab&s;orbed all her admiration.</P>
<P>Too rea&s;onable, in &s;uch a frame of mind, to plan
forgetting Mandlebert &s;he now only determined to
think of him as &s;he had thought before her affections
became entangled; to think of him, in &s;hort, as he
<PB N="2" REF="3">
&s;eemed him&s;elf to de&s;ire; to &s;eek his friendly offices
and advice, but to reject every offered e&s;tabli&s;hment,
and to live &s;ingle for life.</P>
<P>Gratified by indulgent prai&s;e, and &s;u&s;tained by ex|erted
virtue, the revived Eugenia had nearly reached
Cleves, on her return, when the carriage was &s;topt by
a gentleman on hor&s;eback, who, approaching the coach
window, &s;aid, in a low voice, as if unwilling to be heard
by the &s;ervants&mdash;&startq;O, Madam! has Fate &s;et a&s;ide
her cruelty? and does Fortune permit me to live once
more?&endq;</P>
<P>She then recollected Mr. Bellamy. She had only
her maid in the carriage, who was &s;ent for her by Sir
Hugh, Mi&s;s Margland being otherwi&s;e engaged.</P>
<P>All that had &s;o lately pa&s;&s;ed upon her per&s;on and ap|pearance
being full upon her mind, &s;he involuntarily
&s;hrunk back, hiding her face with her cloak.</P>
<P>Bellamy, by no means conceiving this mark of emo|tion
to be unfavourable, &s;teadied his hor&s;e, by leaning
one hand on the coach-window, and &s;aid, in a yet lower
voice&mdash;&startq;O, Madam! is it po&s;&s;ible you can hate me
&s;o barbarou&s;ly?&mdash;will you not even deign to look at
me, though I have &s;o long been bani&s;hed from your pre|&s;ence?&endq;</P>
<P>Eugenia, during this &s;peech, called to mind, that
though new, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to her&s;elf, &s;he was not
&s;o to this gentleman, and ventured to uncover her face;
when the grief painted on the fine features of Bellamy,
&s;o forcibly touched her, that &s;he &s;oftly an&s;wered &startq;No,
Sir, indeed I do not hate you; I am incapable of
&s;uch ingratitude; but I conjure&mdash;I be&s;eech you to for|get
me!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Forget you?&mdash;O, Madam! you command an im|po&s;&s;ibility!
&mdash;No, I am con&s;tancy it&s;elf, and not all the
world united &s;hall tear you from my heart!&endq;</P>
<P>Jacob, who caught a world or two, now rode up to
the other window, and as Eugenia began&mdash;&startq;Conquer,
Sir, I entreat you, this ill-fated partiality!&mdash;&endq; told her
the hor&s;es had been hard-worked, and mu&s;t go home.</P>
<P>As Jacob was the oracle of Sir Hugh about his hor&s;es,
his will was pre&s;criptive law; Eugenia never di&s;puted
<PB N="3" REF="4">
it, and only &s;aying,&mdash;&startq;Think of me, Sir, no more!&endq;
bid the coachman drive on.</P>
<P>Bellamy, re&s;pectfully &s;ubmitting, continued, with his
hat in his hand, as the maid informed her mi&s;tre&s;s,
looking after the carriage till it was out of &s;ight.</P>
<P>A tender &s;orrow now &s;tole upon the ju&s;t revived tran|quillity
of the gentle and generous Eugenia. &startq;Ah!&endq;
thought &s;he, &startq;I have rendered, little as I &s;eem worthy
of &s;uch a power, I have rendered this amiable man
mi&s;erable, though po&s;&s;ibly, and probably, he is the only
man in exi&s;tence whom I could render happy!&mdash;Ah!
how may I dare expect from Clermont a &s;imilar-pa&s;|&s;ion?&endq;</P>
<P>Molly Mill, a very young girl, and daughter of a
poor tenant of Sir Hugh, interrupted the&s;e reflections
from time to time, with remarks upon their object.
&startq;Dearee me, Mi&s;s,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;what a fine gentle|man
that was!&mdash;he &s;ighed like to &s;plit his heart when
you &s;aid, don't think about me no more. He's &s;ome
loveyer, like, I'm &s;ure.&endq;</P>
<P>Eugenia returned home &s;o much moved by this in|cident,
that Sir Hugh, believing his brother him&s;elf
had failed to revive her, was di&s;turbed all anew with
acute contrition for her di&s;a&s;ters, and feeling very un|well,
went to bed before &s;upper time.</P>
<P>Eugenia retired al&s;o; and after &s;pending the even|ing
in &s;oft compa&s;&s;ion for Bellamy, and unfixed appre|hen&s;ions
and di&s;ta&s;te for young Lynmere, was prepar|ing
to go to bed, when Molly Mill, out of breath with
ha&s;te, brought her a letter.</P>
<P>She eagerly opened it, whil&s;t enquiring whence it
came.</P>
<P>&startq;O, Mi&s;s, the fine gentleman&mdash;that &s;ame fine gen|tleman
&mdash;brought it him&s;elf: and he &s;ent for me out,
and I did not know who I was to go to, for Mary
only &s;aid a boy wanted me; but the boy &s;aid, I mu&s;t
come with him to the &s;tyle; and when I come there,
who &s;hould I &s;ee but the fine gentleman him&s;elf! And
he gave me this letter, and he a&s;ked me to give it you
&mdash;and &s;ee! look Mi&s;s! what I got for my trouble!&endq;</P>
<P>She then exhibited a half-guinea.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="5">
&startq;You have not done right, Molly, in accepting it.
Money is bribery; and you &s;hould have known that the
letter was improperly addre&s;&s;ed, if bribery was requi&s;ite
to make it be delivered.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Dearee me, Mi&s;s, what's half-a-guinea to &s;uch a
gentleman as that? I dare &s;ay he's got his pockets full
of them!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I &s;hall not read it, certainly,&endq; cried Eugenia,
&startq;now I know this circum&s;tance. Give me the wax&mdash;
I will &s;eal it again.&endq;</P>
<P>She then he&s;itated whether &s;he ought to return it, or
&s;hew it to her uncle, or commit it to the flames.</P>
<P>That to which &s;he was mo&s;t unwilling, appeared, to
the &s;trictne&s;s of her principles, to be mo&s;t proper:
&s;he therefore determined that the next morning &s;he
would relate her evening's adventure, and deliver the
unread letter to Sir Hugh.</P>
<P>Had this epi&s;tle not perplexed her, &s;he had meant
never to name its writer. Per&s;uaded her la&s;t words had
finally di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him, &s;he thought it a high point of
female delicacy never to publi&s;h an un&s;ucce&s;sful con|que&s;t.</P>
<P>This re&s;olution taken, &s;he went to bed, &s;atisfied with
her&s;elf, but extremely grieved at the &s;ufferings &s;he was
preparing for one who &s;o &s;ingularly loved her.</P>
<P>The next morning, however, her uncle did not ri&s;e
to breakfa&s;t, and was &s;o low &s;pirited, that fearing to di&s;|turb
him, &s;he deemed it mo&s;t prudent to defer the com|munication.</P>
<P>But when, after &s;he had taken her le&s;&s;on from Dr.
Orkborne, &s;he returned to her room, &s;he found Molly
Mill impatiently waiting for her: &startq;O, Mi&s;s,&endq; &s;he
cried, &startq;here's another letter for you! and you mu&s;t
read it directly, for the gentleman &s;ays if you don't it
will be the death of him.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why did you receive another letter?&endq; &s;aid Eugenia,
di&s;plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>&startq;Dearee me, Mi&s;s, how could I help it? if you'd
&s;een the taking he was in, you'd have took it your&s;elf.
He was all of a quake, and ready to go down of his
two knees. Dearee me, if it did not make my heart
<PB N="5" REF="6">
go pit-pat to &s;ee him! He was like to go out of his
mind, he &s;aid, and the tears, poor gentleman, were all
in his eyes.&endq;</P>
<P>Eugenia now turned away, &s;trongly affected by this
de&s;cription.</P>
<P>&startq;Do, Mi&s;s,&endq; continued Molly, write him a little
&s;crap, if its never &s;o &s;cratched and bad. He'll take it
kinder than nothing. Do, Mi&s;s, do. Don't be ill|natured.
And ju&s;t read this little letter, do Mi&s;s,
do;&mdash;it won't take you much time, you reads &s;o nice
and fa&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why,&endq; cried Eugenia, &startq;did you go to him
again? how could you &s;o incautiou&s;ly entru&s;t your&s;elf
to the conduct of a &s;trange boy?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;A &s;trange boy! dearee me, Mi&s;s, don't you know
it was Tommy Hodd? I knows him will enough; I
knows all the boys, I warrant me, round about here.
Come, Mi&s;s, here's pen and ink; you'll run it off be|fore
one can count five, when you've a mind to it.
He'll be in a &s;ad taking till he &s;ees me come back.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Come back?&endq; is it po&s;&s;ible you have been &s;o impru|dent
as to have promi&s;ed to &s;ee him again?</P>
<P>&startq;Dearee me, yes, Mi&s;s! he'd have made away
with him&s;elf if I had not. He'd been there ever &s;ince
&s;ix in the morning, without nothing to eat or drink, a
riding up and down the road, till he could &s;ee me com|ing
to the &s;tyle. And he &s;ays he'll keep a riding
there all day long, and all night too, till I goes to
him.&endq;</P>
<P>Eugenia conceived her&s;elf now in a &s;ituation of un|exampled
di&s;tre&s;s. She forced Molly Mill to leave
her, that &s;he might deliberate what cour&s;e to pur&s;ue.</P>
<P>Having read no novels, her imagination had never
been awakened to &s;cenes of this kind; and what &s;he
had gathered upon &s;uch &s;ubjects in the poetry and hi&s;|tory
&s;he had &s;tudied with Dr. Orkborne, had only im|pre&s;&s;ed
her fancy in proportion as love bore the charac|ter
of heroi&s;m, and the lover that of an hero. Though
highly therefore romantic, her romance was not the
common adoption of a circulating library: it was &s;im|ply
<PB N="6" REF="7">
that of elevated &s;entiments, formed by animated cre|dulity
playing upon youthful inexperience.</P>
<P>&startq;Alas!&endq; cried &s;he, &startq;what a conflict is mine! I
mu&s;t refu&s;e a man who adores me to di&s;traction, in di&s;|regard
of my unhappy defects, to ca&s;t my&s;elf under the
guidance of one, who perhaps, may e&s;timate beauty &s;o
highly as to de&s;pi&s;e me for its want!&endq;</P>
<P>This idea pleaded &s;o powerfully for Bellamy, that
&s;omething like a wi&s;h to open his letters, obtained par|don
to her little maid for having brought them. She
&s;uppre&s;&s;ed, however, the de&s;ire, though &s;he held them
alternately to her eyes, conjecturing their contents, and
bewailing for their impa&s;&s;ioned writer the cruel an&s;wer
they mu&s;t receive.</P>
<P>Though checked by &s;hame, &s;he had &s;ome de&s;ire to
con&s;ult Camilla; but &s;he could not &s;ee her in time,
Mrs. Arlbery having in&s;i&s;ted upon carrying her in the
evening to a play, which was to be performed, for
one night only, by a company of pa&s;&s;ing &s;trollers at North|wick.</P>
<P>&startq;My deci&s;ion,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;mu&s;t be my own, and
mu&s;t be immediate. Ah! how leave a man &s;uch as
this, to wander night and day neglected and uncertain
of his fate! With tears he &s;ent me his letters!&mdash;
what mu&s;t not have been his de&s;pair when &s;uch was his
&s;en&s;ibility? tears in a man!&mdash;tears, too, that could not
be re&s;trained even till his me&s;&s;enger was out of &s;ight!&mdash;
how touching!&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>Her own then fell, in tender commi&s;eration, and it
was with extreme repugnance &s;he compelled her&s;elf to
take &s;uch mea&s;ures as &s;he thought her duty required.
She &s;ealed the two letters in an empty cover, and hav|ing
directed them to Mr. Bellamy, &s;ummoned Molly
Mill, and told her to convey them to the gentleman, and
po&s;itively acquaint him &s;he mu&s;t receive no more, and
that tho&s;e which were returned had never been read.
She bid her, however, add, that &s;he &s;hould always wi&s;h
for his happine&s;s, and be grateful for his kind partiality;
though &s;he earne&s;tly conjured him to vanqui&s;h a regard
which &s;he did not de&s;erve, and mu&s;t never return.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8">
Molly Mill would fain have remon&s;trated; but Eu|genia,
with that firmne&s;s which, even in the fir&s;t youth,
accompanies a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of preferring duty to incli|nation,
&s;ilenced, and &s;ent her off.</P>
<P>Relieved for her&s;elf, now the &s;truggle was over, &s;he
&s;ecretly rejoiced that it was not for Melmond &s;he had &s;o
hard a part to act: and this idea, while it rendered
Bellamy le&s;s an object of regret, dimini&s;hed al&s;o &s;ome|thing
of her pity for his conflict, by reminding her of
the &s;ucce&s;s which had attended her own &s;imilar exer|tions.</P>
<P>But when Molly returned, her di&s;tre&s;s was renewed:
&s;he brought her the&s;e words, written with a pencil upon
the back of her own cover:</P>
<P>&startq;I do not dare, cruelle&s;t of your &s;ex, to write you
another letter; but if you would &s;ave me from the aby&s;s
of de&s;truction, you will let me hear my final doom
from your own mouth. I a&s;k nothing more! Ah!
walk but one moment in the park, near the pales;
deny not your mi&s;erable adorer this la&s;t &s;ingle reque&s;t,
and he will fly this fatal climate which has &s;wallowed
up his repo&s;e for ever! But, till then, here he will
&s;tay, and never quit the &s;pot whence he &s;ends you the&s;e
lines, till you have deigned to pronounce verbally his
doom, though he &s;hould farni&s;h for want of food!</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>ALPHONSO BELLAMY.&endq;</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<P>Eugenia read this with horror and compa&s;&s;ion. She
imagined he perhaps thought her confined, and would
therefore believe no an&s;wer that did not i&s;&s;ue immedi|ately
from her own lip. She &s;ent Molly to him again
with the &s;ame me&s;&s;age; but Molly returned with a yet
wor&s;e account of his de&s;peration, and a &s;trong a&s;&s;urance,
that if &s;he would only utter to him a &s;ingle word, he
would obey, depart, and live upon it the re&s;t of his
life.</P>
<P>This completely &s;oftened her. Rather than impe|riou&s;ly
&s;uffer &s;uch a pattern of re&s;pectful con&s;tancy to
peri&s;h, &s;he con&s;ented to &s;peak her own negative. But
fearing &s;he might be moved to &s;ome &s;ympathy by his
<PB N="8" REF="9">
grief, &s;he re&s;olved to be accompanied by Camilla,
and deferred, therefore the interview till the next
day.</P>
<P>Molly brought back his humble acknowledgments
for this conce&s;&s;ion, and an account that, at la&s;t, &s;lowly
and &s;adly he had ridden away.</P>
<P>Her feelings were now better &s;atisfied than her un|der&s;tanding.
She feared what &s;he had granted was a
favour; yet her heart was too tender to reproach a
compliance made upon &s;uch conditions, and to prevent
&s;uch evils.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The di&s;a&s;trous Bu&s;kins.</HEAD>
<P>CAMILLA, though her per&s;onal &s;orrows were
blunted by the view of the calamities and re&s;ignation
of her &s;i&s;ter, was &s;o little di&s;po&s;ed for amu&s;ement, that
&s;he had accepted the invitation of Mrs. Arlbery, only
from wanting &s;pirit to re&s;i&s;t its urgency. Mr. Tyrold
was well plea&s;ed that &s;uch a recreation came in her way,
but de&s;ired Lavinia might be of the party: not only
that &s;he might partake of the &s;ame plea&s;ure, but from a
greater &s;ecurity in her prudence, than in that of her na|turally
thoughtle&s;s &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>The town of Etherington afforded no theatre; and
the room fitted up for the night's performance could
contain but two boxes, one of which was &s;ecured for
Mrs. Arlbery and her friends.</P>
<P>The attentive Major was ready to offer his hand to
Camilla upon her arrival. The re&s;t of the officers were
in the box.</P>
<P>The play was Othello; and &s;o mi&s;erably repre&s;ent|ed,
that Lavinia would willingly have retired after the
<PB N="9" REF="10">
fir&s;t &s;cene: but the native &s;pirits of Camilla revi&s;ited
her in the view of the ludicrous per&s;onages of the dra|ma.
And they were &s;oon joined by Sir Sedley Cla|rendel,
who&s;e quaint conceits and remarks a&s;&s;i&s;ted the
ri&s;ibility of the &s;cene. She thought him the lea&s;t com|prehen&s;ible
per&s;on &s;he had ever known; but he was
totally indifferent to her, his oddity entertained without
tormenting her.</P>
<P>The actors were of the lowe&s;t &s;trolling kind, and &s;o
utterly without merit, that they had never yet met with
&s;ufficient encouragement to remain one week in the
&s;ame place. They had only a &s;ingle &s;cene for the whole
performance, which depictured a camp, and which here
&s;erved for a &s;treet, a &s;enate, a city, a ca&s;tle, and a bed|chamber.</P>
<P>The dre&s;&s;es were almo&s;t equally par&s;imonious, every
one being obliged to take what would fit him, from a
wardrobe that did not allow quite two dre&s;&s;es a per&s;on
for all the plays they had to enact. Othello, there|fore,
was equipped as king Richard the third, &s;ave that
in&s;tead of a regal front he had a black wig, to imitate
wool: while his face had been begrimed with a &s;moked
cork.</P>
<P>Iago wore a &s;uit of cloaths originally made for Lord
Foppington: Brabantio had borrowed the armour of
Hamlet's Gho&s;t: Ca&s;&s;io, the Lieutenant General in
the chri&s;tian army, had only been able to equip him&s;elf
in O&s;myn's Turki&s;h ve&s;t; and Roderigo, accoutred in
the garment of Shylock, came forth a complete Jew.</P>
<P>De&s;demona, attired more &s;uitably to her fate than
to her expectations, went through the whole of her
part, except the la&s;t &s;cene, in the &s;able weeds of I&s;abella.
And Amelia was fain to content her&s;elf with the ha|bit
of the fir&s;t witch in Macbeth.</P>
<P>The ge&s;tures, both of the gentlemen and ladies, were
as outrageous as if meant rather to intimidate the au|dience,
than to &s;hew their own animation; and the men
approached each other &s;o clo&s;ely with arms a-kimbo, or
double fi&s;ts, that Sir Sedley, with pretended alarm,
&s;aid they were giving challenges for a boxing match.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="11">
The ladies al&s;o, in the energy of their de&s;ire not be
eclip&s;ed, took &s;o much exerci&s;e in their action, that
they tore out the &s;leeves of their gowns; which, though
pinned up every time they left the &s;tage, completely
expo&s;ed their &s;houlders at the end of every act; and
they rai&s;ed their arms &s;o high while facing each other,
that Sir Sedley expre&s;&s;ed frequent fears they meant to
fini&s;h by pulling caps.</P>
<P>So imperfect were they al&s;o in their parts, that the
prompter was the only per&s;on from whom any &s;ingle
&s;peech pa&s;&s;ed without a blunder.</P>
<P>Iago, who was the ma&s;ter of the troop, was the &s;ole
performer who &s;poke not with a provincial dialect: the

This happily making the gentle De&s;demona recog|ni&s;ed,

bridal, her Somer&s;et&s;hire father cried:
<Q><L>I preay you her 'ur zpeak.</L>
<L>If a confez that a waz half the woer</L>
<L>Deztruction on my head, if my bead bleame</L>
<L>Light o' the mon!</L></Q></P>
<P>His daughter, in the Worce&s;ter&s;hire pronunciation,
an&s;wered:
<Q><L>Noble father,</L>
<L>Hi do perceive ere a divided duty;</L>
<L>To you hi howe my life hand heducation,</L>
<L>My life hand heducation both do teach me</L>
<L>Ow to re&s;pect you. You're the lord hof duty;</L>
<L>Hi'm itherto your daughter: but ere's my u&s;|band!
&mdash;</L>
<L>The fond Othello then exclaimed:</L>
<L>Your woices, lords! be&s;eech you let her vill</L>
<L>Have a free vay!&mdash;</L>
<L>And Brabantio took leave with</L>
<L>Look to'ur, Moor! if th' azt eyez to zee;</L>
<L>A haz deceiv'd 'ur veather, and may thee.&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>They were detained &s;o long between the fir&s;t and
&s;econd act, that Sir Sedley &s;aid he feared poor De&s;de|mona
had lo&s;t the thread-paper from which &s;he was to
mend her gown, and recommended to the two young
ladies to have the charity to go and a&s;&s;i&s;t her. &startq;Con|&s;ider,&endq;
he &s;aid, &startq;the trepidation of a fair bride but ju&s;t
entered into her &s;hackles. Who knows but Othello
may be giving her a &s;trapping, in private, for wearing
out her cloaths &s;o fa&s;t! you young ladies think nothing
of the&s;e little conjugal freedoms.&endq;</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, though for &s;ome time &s;he had been as
well diverted by the play as Camilla, le&s;s new to &s;uch
exhibitions, was &s;oon tired of the &s;amene&s;s of the blun|ders,
and, at the end of the fourth act, propo&s;ed retir|ing.
But Camilla, who had long not felt &s;o much en|tertained,
<PB N="12" REF="13">
looked &s;o di&s;appointed, that her good humour
overcame her fatigue, and &s;he was in&s;i&s;ting upon &s;tay|ing;
when a gentleman, who vi&s;ited them from the
oppo&s;ite box, propo&s;ed that the young ladies &s;hould be
carried home by his mother, a lady who lived at Ether|ington,
and was acquainted at the rectory, and who
intended to &s;tay out not only the play but the farce.
Lavinia con&s;ented; the &s;on went with the propo&s;ition,
and bu&s;ine&s;s was &s;oon arranged. Mrs. Arlbery, who
had three miles to go beyond the par&s;onage-hou&s;e, and
who, though &s;he delighted to oblige, was but little in
the habit of practi&s;ing &s;elf-denial, then con&s;igned the
young ladies to General Kin&s;ale, to be conducted to the
oppo&s;ite box, and was handed by Colonel Handover to
her coach.</P>
<P>The General guarded the elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter; the Major
took care of Camilla: but they were all &s;topt in their
pa&s;&s;age by the &s;udden &s;eizure of a pickpocket, and
forced ha&s;tily back to the box they had quitted.</P>
<P>This commotion, though it had di&s;turbed all the
audience, had not &s;topt the performance; and De&s;de|mona
being ju&s;t now di&s;covered in bed, Camilla, not
to lo&s;e the intere&s;ting &s;cene, per&s;uaded her &s;i&s;ter to wait
till the play was over, before they attempted again to
cro&s;s to the oppo&s;ite box; into which, in a few minutes
after, &s;he &s;aw Mandlebert enter.</P>
<P>They had both already &s;eated them&s;elves as much
out of &s;ight as po&s;&s;ible; and Camilla now began to re|gret
&s;he had not accompanied Mrs. Arlbery. She had
thought only of the play and its entertainment, till the
&s;ight of Mandlebert told her that her &s;ituation was im|proper:
and the idea only occurred to her by con&s;ider|ing
that it would occur to him.</P>
<P>Mandlebert had dined out with a party of men, and
had &s;tept in to &s;ee what was going forwards, without
any knowledge whom he &s;hould meet: he in&s;tantly
di&s;cerned Lavinia, and felt anxious to know why Ca|milla
was not with her, and why &s;he &s;at &s;o much out of
&s;ight: but Camilla &s;o completely hid her&s;elf, he could
only &s;ee there was a female, whom he concluded to be
<PB N="13" REF="14">
&s;ome Etherington lady; and he determined to make
further enquiry when the act &s;hould be over.</P>
<P>The performance now became &s;o truly ludicrous, that
Camilla, notwith&s;tanding all her unea&s;ine&s;s, was excit|ed
to almo&s;t perpetual laughter.</P>
<P>De&s;demona, either from the effects of a bad cold, or
to give more of nature to her repo&s;e, breathed &s;o hard,
as to rai&s;e a general laugh in the audience; Sir Sedley,
&s;topping his ears, exclaimed, &startq;O! if &s;he &s;nores I
&s;hall plead for her no more, if &s;he tear her gown to
tatters! Suffocation is much too lenient for her. She's
an immen&s;e horrid per&s;onage! na&s;al to alarm!&endq;</P>
<P>Othello then entered, with a tallow candle in his
hand, &s;taring and dropping grea&s;e at every &s;tep; and,
having ju&s;t declared he would not
<Q>Scar that vhiter &s;kin of hers than &s;now,</Q>
perceived a thief in the candle, which made it run
down &s;o fa&s;t over his hand, and the &s;leeves of his coat,
that, the moment not being yet arrived for extingui&s;h|ing
it, he was forced to lay down his &s;word, and, for
want of better means, &s;nuff it with his fingers.</P>
<P>Sir Sedley now prote&s;ted him&s;elf completely di&s;or|dered:
&startq;I mu&s;t be gone,&endq; cried he, &startq;incontinently;
this exceeds re&s;i&s;tance: I &s;han't be alive in another mi|nute.
Are you able to form a notion of any thing more
annihilating? If I did not build upon the plea&s;ure of
&s;eeing him &s;top up tho&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;ing no&s;trils of the gen|tle
De&s;demona, I could not breathe here another in|&s;tant.&endq;</P>
<P>But ju&s;t after, while Othello leant over the bed to
&s;ay&mdash;
<Q><L>&startq;Vhen I've pluck'd the ro&s;e</L>
<L>I cannot give it wital growth again,</L>
<L>It needs mu&s;t vither&endq;&mdash;</L></Q>
his black locks caught fire.</P>
<P>The candle now fell from his hand, and he attempted
to pull of his wig; but it had been tied clo&s;e on, to
appear more natural, and his fright di&s;abled him; he
<PB N="14" REF="15">
therefore flung him&s;elf upon the bed, and rolled the
coverlid over his head.</P>
<P>De&s;demona, exce&s;&s;ively frightened, &s;tarted up, and
jumped out, &s;hrieking aloud&mdash;&startq;O Lord! I &s;hall be
burnt!&endq;</P>
<P>This noble Venetian Dame then exhibited, beneath
an old white &s;atin bed gown, made to cover her arms
and brea&s;t, the dre&s;s in which &s;he had equipped her&s;elf,
between the acts, to be ready for trampling home;
namely, a dirty red and white linen gown, an old blue
&s;tuff quilted coat, and black &s;hoes and &s;tockings.</P>
<P>In this pitiable condition, &s;he was running, &s;cream|ing,
off the &s;tage, when Othello, having quenched the
fire, uncon&s;cious that half his curls had fallen a &s;acri|fice
to the flames, ha&s;tily pur&s;ued her, and, in a violent
pa&s;&s;ion, called her a fool, and brought her back to the
bed; in which he a&s;&s;i&s;ted her to compo&s;e her&s;elf, and
then went behind the &s;cenes to light his candle; which
having done, he gravely returned, and, very carefully
putting it down, renewed his part with the line.</P>
<P>&startq;Be thus vhen thou art dead, and I vill kill thee. And
love thee after&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>Amid&s;t roars of laughter from the whole audience,
who, when he ki&s;&s;ed her, almo&s;t with one voice call|ed
out&mdash;&startq;Ay ay, that's right&mdash;ki&s;s and friends!&endq;</P>
<P>And when he &s;aid&mdash;
<Q>&startq;I mu&s;t veep&endq;&mdash;</Q>
&startq;So mu&s;t I too, my good friend,&endq; cried Sir Sedley,
wiping his eyes, &startq;for never yet did &s;orrow co&s;t me
more &s;alt rheum! Poor Blacky! thou ha&s;t been mo&s;t
indi&s;&s;olubly comic, I confe&s;s. Thou ha&s;t un&s;trung me
to a degree. A baby of half an hour might demoli&s;h
me.&endq;</P>
<P>And again, when Othello exclaimed&mdash;
<Q>&startq;She vakes!&endq;</Q>
&startq;The deuce &s;he does?&endq; cried Sir Sedley, &startq;what! has
&s;he been a&s;leep again already? She's a very caricatura
of Morpheus. Ay, do thy wor&s;t, hone&s;t Mungo. I
<PB N="15" REF="16">
can't po&s;&s;ibly beg her off. I would &s;ooner &s;nift thy
farthing candle once a day, than &s;u&s;tain that na&s;al ca|dence
ever more.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He's the fine&s;t fellow upon the face of the earth,&endq;
cried Mr. Macder&s;ey, who had li&s;tened to the whole
play with the mo&s;t &s;erious intere&s;t; &startq;the in&s;tant he
&s;u&s;pects his wife, he cuts her off without ceremony;
though &s;he's dearer to him than his eye &s;ight, and beau|tiful
as an angel. How I envy him!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Don't you think 'twould have been as well,&endq; &s;aid
General Kin&s;ale, &startq;if he'd fir&s;t made &s;ome little en|quiry?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He can do that afterwards, General; and then no|body
will dare &s;urmi&s;e it's out of weakne&s;s. For to be
&s;ure and certain, he ought to right her fame; that's no
more than his duty, after once he has &s;atisfied his own.
But a man's honour is deare&s;t to him of all things. A
wife's a bauble to it&mdash;not worth a thought.&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;uffocating was now beginning; but ju&s;t as De&s;|demona
begged to be &s;pared&mdash;
<Q>&startq;But alf han our&endq;&mdash;</Q>
the door-keeper forced his way into the pit, and called
out&mdash;&startq;Pray, is one Mi&s;s Tyrold here in the play|hou&s;e?&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;i&s;ters, in much amazement hung back, entreat|ing
the Gentlemen to &s;creen them; and the man, re|ceiving
no an&s;wer went away.</P>
<P>While wondering what this could mean, the play was
fini&s;hed, when one of the comedians, a brother of the
Worce&s;ter&s;hire De&s;demona, came to the pit door, call|ing
out&mdash;&startq;Hi'm de&s;ired to ha&s;k hif Mi&s;s Camilla Ty|rold's
hany way ere hin the ou&s;e, for hi'm hordered
to call er hout, for her Huncle's hill and dying.&endq;</P>
<P>A piercing &s;hriek from Camilla now completed the
interruption of all attention to the performance, and be|trayed
her hiding place. Concealment, indeed, was
bani&s;hed her thoughts, and &s;he would her&s;elf have open|ed
the box door to ru&s;h out, had not the Major anti|cipated
her, &s;eizing, at the &s;ame-time, her hand to con|duct
her through the crowd.</P>

<P>LAVINIA, almo&s;t equally terrified, followed her &s;i&s;|ter;
and Sir Sedley, burying all foppery in compa&s;&s;ion
and good nature, was foremo&s;t to accompany and a&s;&s;i&s;t.
Camilla had no thought but to get in&s;tantly to Cleves;
&s;he con&s;idered not how; &s;he only forced her&s;elf rapidly
on, per&s;uaded &s;he could walk it in ten minutes, and eja|culating
ince&s;&s;antly, &startq;My Uncle!&mdash;my dear Un|cle!&endq;
&mdash;</P>
<P>They almo&s;t in&s;tantly encountered Edgar, who, up|on
the fatal call, had darted round to meet them, and
finding each provided with an attendant, inquired who&s;e
carriage he &s;hould &s;eek?</P>
<P>Camilla, in a broken voice, an&s;wered &s;he had no car|riage,
and &s;hould walk.</P>
<P>&startq;Walk?&endq; he repeated; you are near five miles from
Cleves!&endq;</P>
<P>Scarce in her &s;en&s;es, &s;he hurried on without reply.</P>
<P>&startq;What carriage did you come in, Mi&s;s Tyrold?&endq;
&s;aid Edgar to Lavinia.</P>
<P>&startq;We came with Mrs. Albery.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Mrs. Arlbery?&mdash;&s;he has been gone this half hour;
I met her as I entered.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla had now ru&s;hed out of doors, &s;till handed by
the Major.</P>
<P>&startq;If you have no carriage in waiting,&endq; &s;aid Edgar,
&startq;make u&s;e, I be&s;eech, you, of mine!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, gladly! O, thankfully!&endq; cried Camilla, almo&s;t
&s;obbing out her words.</P>
<P>He flew then to call for his chai&s;e, and the door
keeper, for whom Sir Sedley had inquired, came to
them accompanied by Jacob.</P>
<P>&startq;O, Jacob!&endq; &s;he cried, breaking violently from the
<PB N="17" REF="18">
Major, &startq;tell me!&mdash;tell me!&mdash;my Uncle!&mdash;my deare&s;t
Uncle!&endq;</P>
<P>Jacob, in a tone of deep and unfeigned &s;orrow, &s;aid,
his Ma&s;ter had been &s;eized &s;uddenly with the gout in
his &s;tomach, and that the doctor, who had been in&s;tant|ly
fetched, had owned there was little hope.</P>
<P>She could hear no more; the &s;hock overpowered her,
and &s;he funk nearly &s;en&s;ele&s;s into the arms of her &s;i&s;|ter.</P>
<P>She was recovered, however, almo&s;t in a minute, and
carried by Edgar into his chai&s;e, in which he placed her
between him&s;elf and the weeping Lavinia; ha&s;tily tel|ling
the two gentlemen, that his intimate connection
with the family authorized his a&s;&s;i&s;ting and attending
them at &s;uch a period.</P>
<P>This was too well known to be di&s;puted; and Sir
Sedley and the Major, with great concern, uttered their
good wi&s;hes and retreated.</P>
<P>Jacob had already been for Mr. Tyrold, who had &s;et
off in&s;tantaneou&s;ly on hor&s;eback.</P>
<P>Camilla &s;poke not a word the fir&s;t mile, which was
&s;pent in an hy&s;teric &s;obbing: but, recovering a little af|terwards,
and &s;inking on the &s;houlder of her &s;i&s;ter,
&startq;O, Lavinia!&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;&s;hould we lo&s;e my Un|cle
&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>A &s;hower of tears wetted the neck of Lavinia,
who mingled with them her own, though le&s;s violently,
from having le&s;s connection with Sir Hugh, and a &s;en|&s;ibility
le&s;s ungovernable.</P>
<P>She called her&s;elf upon the po&s;tillion to drive fa&s;ter,
and pre&s;&s;ed Edgar continually to hurry him; but though
he gave every charge &s;he could de&s;ire, &s;o much &s;wifter
were her wi&s;hes than any po&s;&s;ible &s;peed, that twenty
times &s;he entreated to get out, believing &s;he could walk
quicker than the hor&s;es galloped.</P>
<P>When they arrived at the park gate, &s;he was with
difficulty held back from opening the chai&s;e door; and
when, at length, they &s;topt at the hou&s;e porch, &s;he could
not wait for the &s;tep, and before Edgar could either pre|cede
or prevent her, threw her&s;elf into the arms of Ja|cob,
<PB N="18" REF="19">
who having ju&s;t di&s;mounted, was fortunately at
hand to &s;ave her from falling.</P>
<P>She &s;topt not to a&s;k any que&s;tion; &startq;My Uncle!&mdash;
my Uncle!&endq; &s;he cried, impetuou&s;ly, and, ru&s;hing pa&s;t all
&s;he met, was in his room in a moment.</P>
<P>Edgar, though he could not ob&s;truct, followed her
clo&s;e, dreading le&s;t Sir Hugh might already be no
more, and determined, in that ca&s;e, to force her from
the fatal &s;pot.</P>
<P>Eugenia, who heard her foot&s;tep, received her at the
door, but took her immediately from the room, &s;oftly
whi&s;pering, while her arms were thrown round her
wai&s;t&mdash;&startq;He will live! he will live, my &s;i&s;ter! his ago|nies
are over&mdash;he is fallen a&s;leep, and he will live!&endq;</P>
<P>This was too &s;udden a joy for the de&s;ponding Ca|milla,
who&s;e breath in&s;tantly &s;topt, and who mu&s;t have
fallen upon the floor, had &s;he not been caught by Ed|gar;
who, though his own eyes copiou&s;ly overflowed
with delight, at &s;uch unexpected good news of the uni|ver&s;ally
beloved Baronet, had &s;tength and exertion &s;uf|ficient
to carry her down &s;tairs into the parlour, accom|panied
by Eugenia.</P>
<P>There, hartshorn and water pre&s;ently revived her,
and then, regardle&s;s of the pre&s;ence of Edgar, &s;he ca&s;t
her&s;elf upon her knees, to utter a fervent thank&s;giving,
in which Eugenia, with equal piety, though more com|po&s;ure,
joined.</P>
<P>Edgar had never yet beheld her in a light &s;o re&s;plen|dent
&mdash;What a heart, thought he, is here! what feelings,
what tenderne&s;s, what animation!&mdash;O, what a heart!
&mdash;were it po&s;&s;ible to touch it!&endq;</P>
<P>The two &s;i&s;ters went both gently up &s;tairs, encou|raging
and congratulating each other in &s;oft whi&s;pers,
and &s;tationed them&s;elves in an anti-room: Mr. Tyrold,
by medical coun&s;el, giving directions that no one but
him&s;elf &s;hould enter the &s;ick chamber.</P>
<P>Edgar, though he only &s;aw the dome&s;tics, could not
per&s;uade him&s;elf to leave the hou&s;e till near two o'clock
in the morning: and by &s;ix, his anxiety brought him
thither again. He then heard, that the Baronet had
pa&s;&s;ed a night of more pain than danger, the gout hav|ing
<PB N="19" REF="20">
been expelled his &s;tomach, though it had been threat|ening
almo&s;t every other part.</P>
<P>Three days and nights pa&s;&s;ed in this manner; during
which, Edgar &s;aw &s;o much of the tender affections, and
&s;ofter character of Camilla, that nothing could have with|held
him from manife&s;ting his entire &s;ympathy in her
feelings, but the unaccountable circum&s;tance of her &s;tart|ing
forth from a back feat at the play, where &s;he had &s;at
concealed, attended by the Major, and without any ma|tron
protectre&s;s.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland, meanwhile, &s;cowled at him, and In|diana
pouted in vain. His earne&s;t &s;olicitude for Sir
Hugh &s;urmounted every &s;uch ob&s;tacle to his pre&s;ent vi|&s;its
at Cleves; and he &s;pent there almo&s;t the whole of
his time.</P>
<P>On the fourth day of the attack, Sir Hugh had a
&s;leep of five hour's continuance, from which he awoke
&s;o much revived, that he rai&s;ed him&s;elf in his bed, and
called out&mdash;&startq;My dear Brother! you are &s;till here?&mdash;
you are very good to me, indeed; poor &s;inner that I
am! to forgive me for all my bad behaviour to your
Children.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My deare&s;t Brother! my Children, like my&s;elf,
owe you nothing but kindne&s;s and beneficence; and
like my&s;elf, feel for you nothing but gratitude and ten|derne&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;They are very good, very good indeed,&endq; &s;aid Sir
Hugh, with a deep &s;igh; &startq;but Eugenia!&mdash;poor little
Eugenia has nearly been the death of me; though not
meaning it in the lea&s;t, being all her life as innocent as
a lamb.&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold a&s;&s;ured him, that Eugenia was attached
to him with the mo&s;t unalterable fondne&s;s. But Sir
Hugh &s;aid, that the &s;ight of her, returning from Ether|ington,
with nearly the &s;ame &s;adne&s;s as ever, had wound|ed
him to the heart, by &s;hewing him &s;he would never
recover; which had brought back upon him all his fir&s;t
contrition, about the &s;mall-pox, and the fall from the
plank, and had cau&s;ed his con&s;cience to give him &s;o ma|ny
twiches, that it never let him re&s;t a moment, till the
<PB N="20" REF="21">
gout &s;eized upon his &s;tomach, and almo&s;t took him off
at once.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold attributed &s;olely to his own &s;trong ima|gination
the idea of the continuance of the dejection of
Eugenia, as &s;he had left Etherington calm, and almo&s;t
chearful. He in&s;tantly, therefore, fetched her, inti|mating
the &s;pecies of con&s;olation &s;he could afford.</P>
<P>&startq;Kinde&s;t of Uneles!&endq; cried &s;he, &startq;is it po&s;&s;ible you
can ever, for a moment, have doubted the grateful af|fection
with which your goodne&s;s has impre&s;&s;ed me
from my childhood? Do me more ju&s;tice, I be&s;eech you,
my deare&s;t Uncle! recover from this terrible at|tack,
and you &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee your Eugenia re&s;tored to all
the happine&s;s you can wi&s;h her.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Nobody has got &s;uch kind nieces as me!&endq; cried Sir
Hugh, again di&s;&s;olving into tenderne&s;s; &startq;for all nobody
has de&s;erved &s;o ill of them. My generous little Ca|milla,
forgave me from the very fir&s;t, before her young
&s;oul had any guile in it, which, God knows, it never
has had to this hour, no more than your own. How|ever,
this I can tell you, which may &s;erve to keep you
from repenting being good, and that is, that your kind|ne&s;s
to your poor Uncle may be the means of &s;aving a
chri&s;tian's life; which, for a young per&s;on at your age,
is as much as can be expected: for I think, I may yet
get about again, if I could once be a&s;&s;ured I &s;hould &s;ee
you as happy as you u&s;ed to be; and you've been the
contentede&s;t little thing, till tho&s;e unlucky market-wo|men,
that ever was &s;een: always &s;peaking up for the &s;er|vants,
and the poor, from the time you were eight years
old. And never letting me be angry, but taking every
body's part, and thinking them all as good as your&s;elf,
and only wanting to make them as happy.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ah, my dear Uncle! how kind a memory is
your's! retaining only what can give plea&s;ure, and
burying in oblivion whatever might cau&s;e pain!&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Is my Uncle well enough to &s;peak?&endq; cried Ca|milla,
&s;oftly opening the door, &startq;and may I&mdash;for one
&s;ingle moment,&mdash;&s;ee him?&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;That's the voice of my dear Camilla!&endq; &s;aid Sir
<PB N="21" REF="22">
Hugh; &startq;come in, my little love for I &s;ha'n't &s;hock your
tender heart now, for I'm going to get better.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, in an extacy, was in&s;tantly at his bed-&s;ide,
pa&s;&s;ionately exclaiming, &startq;My dear, dear Uncle! will
you indeed recover?&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, throwing his feeble arms round her neck,
and leaning his head upon her &s;houlder, could only
faintly articulate, &startq;If God plea&s;es, I &s;hall, my little
darling, my heart's delight and joy! But don't vex,
whether I do or not, for it is but in the cour&s;e of na|ture
for a man to die, even in his youth; but how much
more when he comes to be old? Though I know you
can't help mi&s;&s;ing me, in particular at the fir&s;t, becau&s;e
of all your goodne&s;s to me</P>
<P>&startq;Mi&s;&s;ing you? O my Uncle! we can never be happy
again without you! never never!&mdash;when your loved
countenance no longer &s;miles upon us,&mdash;when your
kind voice no longer a&s;&s;embles us around you!&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My dear child&mdash;my own little Camilla,&endq; cried Sir
Hugh, in a faint voice, &startq;I am ready to die!&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold here forced her away, and his brother
grew &s;o much wor&s;e, that a dangerous relap&s;e took
place, and for three days more, the phy&s;ician, the nur&s;e,
and Mr. Tyrold, were alone allowed to enter his room.</P>
<P>During this time, the whole family &s;uffered the true&s;t
grief, and Camilla was incon&s;olable.</P>
<P>When again he began to revive, he called Mr. Ty|rold
to him, and &s;aid that this &s;econd &s;hake per&s;uaded
him he had but a &s;hort time more for this world; and
begged therefore he would prepare him for his exit.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold complied, and found, with more happi|ne&s;s
than &s;urpri&s;e, his perfect and chearful re&s;ignation
either to live or to die, rejoicing as much as him&s;elf, in
the innocent benevolence of his pa&s;t days.</P>
<P>Compo&s;ed and &s;trengthened by religious duties, he
then de&s;ired to &s;ee Eugenia and Indiana, that he might
give them his la&s;t exhortations and coun&s;el, in ca&s;e of a
&s;peedy end.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold would fain have &s;pared him this touch|ing
exertion, but he declared he could not go off with a
clear con&s;cience, unle&s;s he told them the advice which
<PB N="22" REF="23">
he had been thinking of for them, between whiles, du|ring
all his illne&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold then feared that oppo&s;ition might but
di&s;compo&s;e him, and &s;ummoned his younge&s;t daughter
and his niece, charging them both to repre&s;s their af|fliction,
le&s;t it &s;hould accelerate what they mo&s;tly dread|ed.</P>
<P>Camilla, always upon the watch, glided in with
them, &s;upplicating her Father not to deny her admit|tance;
though fearful of her impetuous &s;orrows, he
wi&s;hed her to retreat; but Sir Hugh no &s;ooner heard
her murmuring voice, than he declared he would have
her refu&s;ed nothing, though he had meant to take a par|ticular
leave of her alone, for the la&s;t thing of all.</P>
<P>Gratefully thanking him, &s;he advanced trembling to
his bed-&s;ide; &s;olemnly promi&s;ing her Father that no ex|pre&s;&s;ion
of her grief &s;hould again ri&s;k agitating a life and
health &s;o precious.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh then de&s;ired to have Lavinia called al&s;o,
becau&s;e, though he had thought of nothing to &s;ay to
her, &s;he might be hurt, after he was gone, in being left
out.</P>
<P>He was then rai&s;ed by pillows and &s;at upright, and
they knelt round his bed. Mr. Tyrold entreated him to
be conci&s;e, and in&s;i&s;ted upon the extreme&s;t forbearance
and fortitude in his little audience. He &s;eated him&s;elf
at &s;ome di&s;tance, and Sir Hugh, after &s;wallowing a cor|dial
medicine, began:</P>
<P>&startq;My dear Nieces, I have &s;ent for you all upon a par|ticular
account, which I beg you to li&s;ten to, becau&s;e,
God only knows whether I may ever be able to give you
&s;o much advice again. I &s;ee you all look very melan|choly,
which I take very kind of you. However don't
cry, my little dears, for we mu&s;t all go off, &s;o it mat|ters
but little the day or the hour; dying being, be&s;ides,
the greate&s;t comfort of us all, taking us off from our
cares; as my Brother will explain to you better than
me.</P>
<P>&startq;The chief of what I have got to &s;ay,&endq; in regard to
what I have been &s;tudying in my illne&s;s, is for you two,
my dear Eugenia and Indiana; becau&s;e, having brought&endq;
<PB N="23" REF="24">
you both up, I can't get it out of my head what you'll
do, when I am no longer here to keep you out of the
danger of bad de&s;igners.</P>
<P>&startq;My hope had been to have &s;een you both married
while I was alive and among&s;t you, and I made as
many plans as my poor head knew how, to bring it
about; but we've all been di&s;appointed alike, for which
rea&s;on we mu&s;t put up with it properly.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What I have now la&s;t of all, to &s;ay to you, my
little dears, is three maxims, which may &s;erve for
you all four alike, though I thought of them, at fir&s;t,
only for you too.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;In the fir&s;t place, <HI>Never be proud:</HI> if you are,
your &s;uperiors will laugh at you, your equals won't
love you, and your dependants will hate you. And
what is there for poor mortal man to be proud of?&mdash;
Riches!&mdash;why they are but a charge, and if we
don't u&s;e them well, we may envy the poor beggar
that has &s;o much le&s;s to an&s;wer for.&mdash;Beauty?&mdash;
why, we can neither get it when we have n't it; nor
keep it when we have it.&mdash;Power!&mdash;why we &s;carce
ever u&s;e it one way, but what we are &s;orry we did not
u&s;e it another!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;In the &s;econd place, <HI>Never tru&s;t a Flatterer.</HI> If
a man makes you a great many compliments, always
&s;u&s;pect him of &s;ome bad de&s;ign, and never believe
him your friend, till he tells you of &s;ome of your
faults. Poor little things! you little imagine how
many you have, for all you're &s;o good!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;In the third place, <HI>Do no harm to others, for the
&s;ake of any good it may do to your&s;elves;</HI> becau&s;e the
good will la&s;t you but a little while; and the repen|tance
will &s;tick by you as long as you live; and
what is wor&s;e, a great while longer, and beyond any
count the be&s;t Almanack-maker knows how to rec|kon.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And now, my dear Nieces, this is all; except
the recommending to my dear Eugenia to be kind to
my poor &s;ervants, who have all u&s;ed me &s;o well,
knowing I have nothing to leave them.&endq;</P>
<P>Eugenia, &s;uppre&s;&s;ing her &s;obs, promi&s;ed to retain
them all, as long as they &s;hould de&s;ire to remain with
her, and to provide for them afterwards.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="25">
&startq;I know you'll forget nobody, my dear little
girl,&endq; cried the Baronet, &startq;which makes me die con|tented;
not even Mrs. Margland, a little particularity
not being to be con&s;idered at one's la&s;t end: and much
le&s;s Dr. Orkborne, who has &s;o much a better right
from you. As to Indiana, &s;he'll have her own little
fortune when &s;he comes of age; and I dare &s;ay her
pretty face will marry her before long.&mdash;And as to
Clermont, he'll come off rather &s;hort, finding I leave
him nothing; but you'll make up for the deficiency,
by giving him the whole, as well as a good wife. As
to Lionel, I leave him my ble&s;&s;ing; and as to any
other legacy I never happened to promi&s;e him any;
which is very good luck for me, as well as my be&s;t
excu&s;e; and I may &s;ay the &s;ame to my dear Lavinia,
which is the rea&s;on I called her in, becau&s;e &s;he may
not often have an opportunity to hear a man &s;peak
upon his death bed. However all I wi&s;h for is, that
I could leave you all equal &s;hares, as well as give Eu|genia
the whole.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O my dear Uncle!&endq; exclaimed Eugenia, &startq;make
a new Will immediately! do every thing your tender|ne&s;s
can dictate!&mdash;or tell me what I &s;hall do in your
name, and every word, every wi&s;h &s;hall be &s;acredly
obeyed!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Dear, generous, noble girl! no! I won't take
from you a &s;hilling! keep it all&mdash;nobody will &s;pend it
&s;o well;&mdash;and I can't give you back your beauty; &s;o
keep it, my dear, all, for my oath's &s;ake, when I
am gone; and don't make me die under a prevaricat|ing;
which would be but a grievous thing for a per&s;on
to do; unle&s;s he was but a bad believer: which, God
help us! there are enough, without my helping to
make more.&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold now again remon&s;trated, motioning to
the weeping group to be gone.</P>
<P>&startq;Ah! my dear Brother!&endq; &s;aid Sir Hugh, &startq;you are
the only right per&s;on that ought to have had it all, if it
had not been for my poor weak brain, that made me
always be looking a&s;kew, in&s;tead of &s;trait forward.
And indeed I always meant you to have had it for your
life, till the &s;mall $ox put all things out of my head.
<PB N="25" REF="26">
However, I hope you won't object to preach my fune|ral
&s;ermon, for all my bad faults, for nobody el&s;e will
&s;peak of me &s;o kindly; which may &s;erve as a better
le&s;&s;on for tho&s;e I leave behind.&endq;</P>
<P>Tears flowed fa&s;t down the cheeks of Mr. Tyrold,
as he uttered whatever he could &s;ugge&s;t mo&s;t tenderly
&s;oothing to his Brother: and the young mourners,
not daring to re&s;i&s;t, were all gliding away, except
Camilla, who&s;e hand was fa&s;t gra&s;ped in that of her
Uncle.</P>
<P>&startq;Ah, my Camilla,&endq; cried he, as &s;he would gently
have withdrawn it, &startq;how &s;hall I part with my little
dear darling? this is the wor&s;t twitch to me of all,
with all my contentedne&s;s! And the more becau&s;e I
know you love your poor old Uncle, ju&s;t as well as if
he had left you all he was worth, though you won't
get one penny by his death!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O my dear, deare&s;t Uncle&mdash;&endq; exclaimed Camilla,
in a pa&s;&s;ionate flood of tears; when Mr. Tyrold, a&s;|&s;uring
them both the con&s;equences might be fatal, tore
her away from the bed and the room.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Pur&s;uer.</HEAD>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the fears &s;o ju&s;tly ex|cited
from the mixt emotions and exertions of Sir
Hugh, Mr. Tyrold had the happine&s;s to &s;ee him fall
into a tranquil &s;leep, from which he awoke without
any return of pain; his night was quiet; the next
day was &s;till better; and the day following he was
pronounced out of danger.</P>
<P>The rapture which this declaration excited in the
hou&s;e, and diffu&s;ed throughout the neighbourhood,
<PB N="26" REF="27">
when communicated to the worthy baronet, gave a
gladne&s;s to his heart that recompen&s;ed all he had &s;uf|fered.</P>
<P>The delight of Camilla exceeded whatever &s;he had
yet experienced: her life had lo&s;t half its value in her
e&s;timation, while &s;he believed that of her uncle to be
in danger.</P>
<P>No one &s;ingle quality is perhaps &s;o endearing, from
man to man, as good-nature. Talents excite more
admiration; wi&s;dom, more re&s;pect; and virtue, more
e&s;teem; but with admiration envy is apt to mingle,
and fear with re&s;pect; while e&s;teem, though always
honourable, is often cold; but good-nature gives
plea&s;ure without any allay; ea&s;e, confidence, and
happy carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, without the pain of obligation,
without the exertion of gratitude.</P>
<P>If joy was in &s;ome more tumultuous, content was
with none &s;o penetrating as with Eugenia. Appri&s;ed
now that &s;he had been the immediate cau&s;e of the &s;uf|ferings
of her uncle, his lo&s;s would have given to her
peace a blow irrecoverable; and &s;he determined to
bend the whole of her thoughts to his wi&s;hes, his com|fort,
his entire re&s;toration.</P>
<P>To this end all her virtue was called in aid; a fear,
next to aver&s;ion, having &s;eized her of Clermont, from
the apprehen&s;ion &s;he might never in&s;pire in him &s;uch
love as &s;he had in&s;pired in Bellamy, nor &s;ee in him, as
in young Melmond, &s;uch merit as might rai&s;e &s;imilar
&s;entiments for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Molly Mill had not failed to paint to her the di&s;ap|pointment
of Bellamy in not &s;eeing her; but &s;he was
too much engro&s;&s;ed by the dangerous &s;tate of her uncle,
to feel any compunction in her breach of promi&s;e;
though touched with the account of his continual &s;uf|ferings,
&s;he became very gentle in her reprimands to
Molly for again meeting him; and, though Molly
again di&s;obeyed, &s;he again was pardoned. He came
daily to the lane behind the park pales, to hear news
of the health of Sir Hugh, without pre&s;&s;ing either for
an interview or a letter; and Eugenia grew more and
more moved by his re&s;pectful ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s. She had
yet &s;aid nothing to Camilla upon the &s;ubject; not only
<PB N="27" REF="28">
becau&s;e a dearer intere&s;t mutually occupied them, but
from a &s;ecret &s;hame of naming a lover at a period &s;o
ungenial.</P>
<P>But now that Sir Hugh was in a fair way of reco|very,
her &s;ituation became alarming to her&s;elf.&mdash;
Openly, and before the whole hou&s;e, &s;he had &s;olemnly
been a&s;&s;igned to Clermont Lynmere; and, little as &s;he
wi&s;hed the connexion, &s;he thought it, from circum|&s;tances,
her duty not to refu&s;e it. Yet this gentleman
had attended her &s;o long, had endured &s;o many di&s;ap|pointments,
and borne them &s;o much to her &s;atisfaction,
that, though &s;he lamented her conce&s;&s;ion as an injury
to Clermont, and grew a&s;hamed to name it even to
Camilla, &s;he believed it would be cruelty unheard of
to break it. She determined, therefore, to &s;ee him,
to pronounce a farewell, and then to bend all her
thoughts to the partner de&s;tined her by her friends.</P>
<P>Molly Mill was alone to accompany her to give her
negative, her good wi&s;hes, and her &s;olemn declaration
that &s;he could never again &s;ee or hear of him more.
He could deem it no indelicacy that &s;he &s;uffered Molly
to be pre&s;ent, &s;ince &s;he was the negociator of his own
choice.</P>
<P>Molly carried him, therefore, this news, with a
previous condition that he was not to detain her mi&s;tre&s;s
one minute. He promi&s;ed all &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and the
next morning, after breakfa&s;t, Eugenia, in extreme
dejection at the ungrateful ta&s;k &s;he had to perform,
called for Molly, and walked forth.</P>
<P>Camilla, who was then accidentally in her own
room, was, &s;oon after, &s;ummoned by three &s;mart raps
to her chamber door.</P>
<P>Where, to her great &s;urpri&s;e, &s;he &s;aw Edgar, who,
after a ha&s;ty apology, begged to have a few minutes
conference with her alone.</P>
<P>She de&s;cended with him into the parlour, which was
vacant.</P>
<P>&startq;You &s;u&s;pect, perhaps,&endq; &s;aid he, in an hurried
manner, though attempting to &s;mile, &startq;that I mean
to fatigue you with &s;ome trouble&s;ome advice; I mu&s;t,
therefore, by an abrupt que&s;tion, explain my&s;elf.
<PB N="28" REF="29">
Does Mr. Bellamy &s;till continue his preten&s;ions to
your &s;i&s;ter Eugenia?&endq;</P>
<P>Startled in a moment from all thoughts of &s;elf, that
at fir&s;t had been ru&s;hing with violence to her heart,
Camilla an&s;wered, &startq;No! why do you a&s;k?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I will tell you: In my regular vi&s;its here of late,
I have almo&s;t con&s;tantly met him, either on foot or on
hor&s;eback, in the vicinity of the park. I &s;u&s;pected he
watched to &s;ee Eugenia; but I knew &s;he now never
left the hou&s;e; and concluded he was ignorant of the
late general confinement. This moment, however,
upon my entrance, I &s;aw him again; and, as he ha&s;tily
turned away upon meeting my eye, I di&s;mounted,
gave my hor&s;e to my man, and determined to &s;atisfy
my&s;elf which way he was &s;trolling. I then followed
him to the little lane to the right of the park, where I
perceived an empty po&s;t-chai&s;e-and-&s;our in waiting:
he advanced, and &s;poke with the po&s;tillion&mdash;I came
in&s;tantly into the hou&s;e by the little gate. This may
be accidental; yet it has alarmed me; and I ventured,
therefore, thus &s;uddenly to apply to you, in order to
urge you to give a caution to Eugenia, not to walk
out, ju&s;t at pre&s;ent, unattended.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla thanked him, and ran eagerly to &s;peak to
her &s;i&s;ter; but &s;he was not in her room; nor was &s;he
with her uncle; nor yet with Dr. Orkborne. She
returned unea&s;ily to the parlour, and &s;aid &s;he would
&s;eek her in the park.</P>
<P>Edgar followed; but they looked around for her
in vain$ he then, deeming the danger urgent, left
her, to ha&s;ten $o the &s;pot where he had &s;een the po&s;t|chai&s;e.</P>
<P>Camilla ran on alone; and, when &s;he reached the
park gate, perceived her &s;i&s;ter, Molly Mill, and
Bellamy, in the lane.</P>
<P>They heard her quick approach, and turned
round.</P>
<P>The countenance of Bellamy exhibited the darke&s;t
di&s;appointment, and that of Eugenia the mo&s;t exce&s;|&s;ive
confu&s;ion. &startq;Now then, Sir,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;delay
our &s;eparation no longer.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="30">
&startq;Ah, permit me,&endq; &s;aid he, in a low voice, &startq;per|mit
me to hope you will hear my la&s;t &s;ad &s;entence, my
final mi&s;ery, another day!&mdash;I will defer my mournful
departure for the melancholy joy, which is the la&s;t I
&s;hall feel in my wretched exi&s;tence!&endq;</P>
<P>He &s;ighed &s;o deeply, that Eugenia, who &s;eemed
already in much &s;orrow, could not utter an abrupt re|fu&s;al;
and, as Camilla now advanced, &s;he turned
from him, without attempting to &s;ay any thing further.</P>
<P>Camilla, in the delight of finding her &s;i&s;ter &s;afe,
after the horrible apprehen&s;ions &s;he had ju&s;t experienc|ed,
could not &s;peak to her for tears.</P>
<P>Aba&s;hed at once, and amazed, Eugenia faintly a&s;|ked
what &s;o affected her? She gave no explanation,
but begged her to turn immediately back.</P>
<P>Eugenia con&s;ented; and Bellamy, bowing to them
both profoundly, with quick &s;teps walked away.</P>
<P>Camilla a&s;ked a thou&s;and que&s;tions; but Eugenia
&s;eemed unable to an&s;wer them.</P>
<P>In a few minutes they were joined by Edgar, who,
walking ha&s;tily up to them, took Camilla apart.</P>
<P>He told her he firmly believed a villainous &s;cheme
to have been laid: he had found the chai&s;e &s;till in
waiting, and a&s;ked the po&s;tillion to whom he belonged.
The man &s;aid he was paid for what he did; and refu&s;ed
giving any account of him&s;elf. Bellamy then appear|ed;
he &s;eemed confounded at his fight; but neither of
them &s;poke; and he left him and his chai&s;e, and his
po&s;tillion, to con&s;ole one another. He doubted not,
he &s;aid, but the de&s;ign had been to carry Eugenia off,
and he had probably only pretended to take leave, that
the chai&s;e might advance, and the po&s;tillion aid the
elopement: though finding help at hand, he had been
forced to give up his &s;cheme.</P>
<P>Camilla even with rapture ble&s;t his fortunate pre|&s;ence;
but was confounded with perplexity at the con|duct
of Eugenia. Edgar, who feared her heart was
entangled by an object who &s;ought only her wealth,
propo&s;ed di&s;mi&s;&s;ing Molly Mill, that he might tell
her him&s;elf the opinion he had conceived of Bellamy.</P>
<P>Camilla overtook her &s;i&s;ter, who had walked on with|out
li&s;tening to or regarding them; and &s;ending away
<PB N="30" REF="31">
Molly, told her Edgar wi&s;hed immediately to conver&s;e
with her, upon &s;omething of the utmo&s;t importance.</P>
<P>&startq;You know my high e&s;teem of him,&endq; &s;he an&s;wer|ed;
&startq;but my mind is now occupied upon a bu&s;ine&s;s
of which he has no information, and I entreat that you
will neither of you interrupt me.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, utterly at a lo&s;s what to conjecture, joined
Mandlebert alone, and told him her ill &s;ucce&s;s. He
thought every thing was to be feared from the pre&s;ent
&s;tate of the affair, and propo&s;ed revealing at once all
he knew of it to Mr. Tyrold: but Camilla de&s;ired him
to take no &s;tep till &s;he had again expo&s;tulated with her
&s;i&s;ter, who might el&s;e be &s;eriou&s;ly hurt or offended.
He complied, and &s;aid he would continue in the hou&s;e,
park, or environs, ince&s;&s;antly upon the watch till
&s;ome deci&s;ive mea&s;ure were adopted.</P>
<P>Joining Eugenia then again, &s;he a&s;ked if &s;he meant
&s;eriou&s;ly to encourage the addre&s;&s;es of Bellamy.</P>
<P>&startq;By no means,&endq; &s;he quietly an&s;wered.</P>
<P>&startq;My dear Eugenia, I cannot at all under&s;tand you;
but it &s;eems clear to me that the arrival of Edgar has
&s;aved you from &s;ome dreadful violence.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You hurt me Camilla, by this prejudice. From
whom &s;hould I dread violence? from a man who&mdash;but
too fatally for his peace&mdash;values me more than his
life?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If I could be &s;ure of his &s;incerity,&endq; &s;aid Camilla,
&startq;I &s;hould be the la&s;t to think ill of him: but reflect
a little, at lea&s;t, upon the ri&s;k that you have run; my
dear Eugenia! there was a po&s;t-chai&s;e in waiting,
not twenty yards from where I &s;topt you!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ah, you little know Bellamy! that chai&s;e was
only to convey him away; to convey him Camilla to
an eternal bani&s;hment.!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But why, then, had he prevailed with you to quit
the park?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You will call me vain if I tell you.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No; I &s;hall only think you kind and confiden|tial.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Do me then the ju&s;tice,&endq; &s;aid Eugenia, blu&s;hing,
to believe me as much &s;urpri&s;ed as your&s;elf at his mo&s;t
unmerited pa&s;&s;ion: but he told me, that if I only ca&s;t
<PB N="31" REF="32">
my eyes upon the vehicle which was to part him from
me for ever, it would not only make it le&s;s abhorrent
to him, but probably prevent the lo&s;s of his &s;en&s;es.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My dear Eugenia,&endq; &s;aid Camilla, half &s;miling,
&startq;this is a violent pa&s;&s;ion, indeed for &s;o &s;hort an ac|quaintance!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I knew you would &s;ay that,&endq; an&s;wered &s;he, di&s;|concerted;
&startq;and it was ju&s;t what I ob&s;erved to him
my&s;elf: but he &s;atisfied me that the rea&s;on of his feel|ings
being &s;o impetuous was, that this was the fir&s;t and
only time he had ever been in love&mdash;So hand&s;ome as
he is!&mdash;what a choice for him to make!&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, tenderly embracing her, declared, &startq;the
choice was all that did him honour in the affair.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He never,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, a little comforted, &startq;makes
me any compliments; I &s;hould el&s;e di&s;regard, if not
di&s;dain him: but indeed he &s;eems notwith&s;tanding his
own extraordinary manly beauty, to be wholly &s;upe|rior
to external con&s;iderations.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla now forbore expre&s;&s;ing farther doubt, from
the fear of painful mi&s;apprehen&s;ion; but earne&s;tly en|treated
her to &s;uffer Edgar to be entru&s;ted and con&s;ult|ed:
&s;he decidely, however, refu&s;ed her con&s;ent. &startq;I
require no advice,&endq; cried &s;he, &startq;for I am devoted to
my uncle's will: to &s;peak then of this affair would be
the mo&s;t cruel indelicacy, in publi&s;hing a conque&s;t
which, &s;ince it is rejected, I ought &s;ilently, though
gratefully, to bury in my own heart.&endq;</P>
<P>She then related the hi&s;tory of all that had pa&s;&s;ed to
Camilla; but &s;olemnly declared &s;he would never, to any
other human being, but him who &s;hould hereafter be
entitled to her whole heart, betray the &s;ecret of the
unhappy Bellamy.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">An Advi&s;er.</HEAD>
<P>THE wi&s;h of Camilla was to lay this whole affair
before her father; but &s;he checked it from an appre|hen&s;ion
&s;he might &s;eem di&s;playing her duty and confi|dence
at the expence of tho&s;e of her &s;i&s;ter; who&s;e mo|tives
for concealment were intentionally the mo&s;t pure,
however practically, they might be erroneous; and
whom &s;he both pitied and revered for her propo&s;ed
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to her uncle, in oppo&s;ition to her palpable
reluctance.</P>
<P>She &s;aw not, however, any ob&s;tacle to con&s;ulting
with Edgar, &s;ince he was already appri&s;ed of the bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
and &s;ince his &s;ervices might be e&s;&s;entially u&s;eful
to her &s;i&s;ter: while, with re&s;pect to her&s;elf, there
&s;eemed, at this time, more of dignity in meeting than
&s;hunning his friendly intercour&s;e, &s;ince his regard for
her &s;eemed to have lo&s;t all its peculiarity. He has
preci&s;ely, cried &s;he the &s;ame &s;entiments for my &s;i&s;ters
as for me,&mdash;he is equally kind, di&s;intere&s;ted, and in|different
to us all! anxious alike for Eugenia with
Mr. Bellamy, and for me with the de$e&s;table Major!
Be it &s;o!&mdash;we can no where obtain a better friend;
and I &s;hould blu&s;h, indeed, if I could not treat as a
brother one who can treat me as a &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Tranquil though not gay, &s;he returned to conver&s;e
with him; but when &s;he had related what had pa&s;&s;ed,
he confe&s;&s;ed that his unea&s;ine&s;s upon the &s;ubject was
increa&s;ed. The heart of Eugenia appeared to him po|&s;itively
entangled; and he be&s;ought Camilla not to
lo&s;e a moment in acquainting Mr. Tyrold with her
&s;ituation.</P>
<P>She pleaded again&s;t giving this pain to her &s;i&s;ter
with energetic affection: her arguments failed to con|vince,
but her eloquence powerfully touched him; and
he contented him&s;elf with only entreating that &s;he
<PB N="33" REF="34">
would again try to aid him with an opportunity of
conver&s;ing with Eugenia.</P>
<P>This &s;he could not refu&s;e; nor could he then re&s;i&s;t
the opportunity to inquire why Mrs. Arlbery had left
her and Lavinia at the play. She thanked him for re|membering
his character of her monitor, and acknow|ledged
the fault to be her own, with a candour &s;o un|affected,
that, captivated by the &s;oft &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of
her manner, he flattered him&s;elf his fear of the Major
was a chimaera, and hoped that, as &s;oon as Sir Hugh
was able to again join his family, no impediment
would remain to his begging the united ble&s;&s;ings of
the two Brothers to his views.</P>
<P>When Camilla told her &s;i&s;ter the reque&s;t of Edgar
&s;he immediately &s;u&s;pected the attachment of Bellamy
had been betrayed to him; and Camilla, incapable of
any duplicity, related preci&s;ely how the matter had
pa&s;&s;ed. Eugenia, always ju&s;t, no &s;ooner heard than
&s;he forgave it and accompanied her &s;i&s;ter immediately
down &s;tairs.</P>
<P>&startq;I mu&s;t re&s;t all my hope of pardon,&endq; cried Edgar,
&startq;for the part I am taking, to your conviction of its
motive; a filial love and gratitude to Mr. Tyrold, a
fraternal affection and intere&s;t for all his family.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My own &s;i&s;terly feelings,&endq; &s;he an&s;wered, &startq;make
me both comprehend and thank your kind &s;olicitude:
but, believe me, it is now founded in error. I am
&s;hocked to find you informed of this unhappy tran&s;ac|tion;
and I charge and be&s;eech that no inference may
wound its ill-fated object, by &s;uffering him to &s;urmi&s;e
your knowledge of his humiliating &s;ituation.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I would not for the world give you pain,&endq; an&s;wer|ed
Edgar: &startq;but permit me to be faithful to the bro|therly
character in which I con&s;ider my&s;elf to &s;tand
with you all.&endq;</P>
<P>A blu&s;h had over&s;pread his face at the word Bro|therly;
while at that of <HI>all,</HI> which recovered him, a
&s;till deeper &s;tained the cheeks of Camilla: but neither
of them looked at the other; and Eugenia was too
&s;elf-ab&s;orbed to ob&s;erve either.</P>
<P>&startq;Your utter inexperience in life,&endq; he continued,
&startq;makes me, though but ju&s;t giving up leading-|&s;trings
my&s;elf, an adept in the compari&s;on. Suffer
<PB N="34" REF="35">
me then as &s;uch to repre&s;ent to you my fears, that
your innocence and goodne&s;s may expo&s;e you to im|po&s;ition.
You mu&s;t not judge all characters by the
ingenuou&s;ne&s;s of your own; nor conclude however
rationally and worthily a mind &s;uch as yours might&mdash;
may&mdash;and will in&s;pire a di&s;intere&s;ted regard, that there
is no danger of any other, and that mercenary views
are out of the que&s;tion, becau&s;e mercenary principles
are not declared.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I will not &s;ay your inference is &s;evere replied Eu|genia,&endq;
&startq;becau&s;e you know not the per&s;on of whom
you &s;peak: but permit me to make this irrefragable
vindication of his freedom from all &s;ordid motives;
he has never once named the word fortune, neither to
make any inquiries into mine, nor any profe&s;&s;ions con|cerning
his own. Had he any inducement to duplicity,
he might have a&s;&s;erted to me what he plea&s;ed, &s;ince I
have no means of detection.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Your &s;ituation,&endq; &s;aid Edgar, &startq;is pretty general|ly
known;&endq; and for his&mdash;pardon me if I hint it may
be po&s;&s;ible that &s;ilence is no virtue. However, &s;ince I
am unacquainted, you &s;ay with his character, will you
give me leave to make my&s;elf better informed?</P>
<P>&startq;There needs no inve&s;tigation; to me it is perfectly
known.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Forgive me if I a&s;k how!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;By his letters and by his conver&s;ation.&endq;</P>
<P>A &s;mile which &s;tole upon the features of Edgar
obliged him to turn his head another way; but pre|&s;ently
recovering, &startq;My dear Mi&s;s Eugenia,&endq; he cried,
&startq;will it not be mo&s;t con&s;onant to your high principles,
and &s;crupulous delicacy, to lay the whole of what has
pa&s;&s;ed before Mr. Tyrold?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Undoubtedly, if my part were not &s;trait forward.
Had I the lea&s;t he&s;itation, my father &s;hould be my im|mediate
and deci&s;ive umpire. But&mdash;I am not at liber|ty
even for deliberation!&mdash;I am not&mdash;I know&mdash;at my
own di&s;po&s;al!&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>She blu&s;hed and looked down, confu&s;ed; but pre|&s;ently,
with firmne&s;s, added, &startq;It is not, indeed, fit
that I &s;hould be; my uncle completely merits to be
in all things my director. To know his wi&s;hes, there|fore,
is not only to know, but to be &s;atisfied with my
doom. Such being my &s;ituation, you cannot mi&s;un|der&s;tand
<PB N="35" REF="36">
my defence of this unhappy young man.
It is but &s;imple ju&s;tice to re&s;cue an amiable per&s;on
from calumny.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Let us allow all this,&endq; &s;aid Edgar; &startq;&s;till I &s;ee
no rea&s;on why Mr. Tyrold&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Mr. Mandlebert,&endq; interrupted &s;he, &startq;you mu&s;t
do what you judge right. I can de&s;ire no one to ab|&s;tain
from pur&s;uing the dictates of their own &s;en&s;e of
honour. I leave you, therefore, un&s;hackled: but
there is no con&s;ideration which, in my opinion, can
ju&s;tify a female in &s;preading, even to her neare&s;t con|nexions,
an unrequited partiality. If, therefore, I am
forced to inflict this undue mortification, upon a per&s;on
to whom I hold my&s;elf &s;o much obliged, an unea&s;ine&s;s
will remain upon my mind, de&s;tructive of my forget|fulne&s;s
of an event which I would fain bani&s;h from my
memory.&endq;</P>
<P>She then refu&s;ed to be any longer detained.</P>
<P>&startq;How I love the perfect innocence, and how I
reverence the re&s;pectable &s;ingularity of that charming
character!&endq; cried Edgar; &startq;yet how vain are all
arguments again&s;t &s;uch a combination of fearle&s;s cre|dulity,
and enthu&s;ia&s;tic rea&s;oning? What can we
determine?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I am happy to retort upon you that que&s;tion,&endq;
replied Camilla; &startq;for I am every way afraid to act
my&s;elf, le&s;t I &s;hould hurt this dear &s;i&s;ter, or do wrong
by my yet dearer father.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What a re&s;pon&s;ibility you ca&s;t upon me! I will
not, however, &s;hrink from it, for the path &s;eems far
plainer to me &s;ince I have had this conver&s;ation.
Eugenia is at pre&s;ent &s;afe; I &s;ee, now, di&s;tinctly, her
heart is yet untouched. The readine&s;s with which &s;he
met the &s;ubject, the openne&s;s with which &s;he avows her
e&s;teem, the unembarra&s;&s;ed, though mode&s;t &s;implicity
with which &s;he &s;peaks of his pa&s;&s;ion and his di&s;tre&s;s, all
&s;hew that her pity re&s;ults from genero&s;ity, not from
love. Had it been otherwi&s;e, with all her &s;teadine&s;s,
all her philo&s;ophy, &s;ome agitation and anxiety would
have betrayed her &s;ecret &s;oul. The internal work|ings
of hopes and fears, the &s;en&s;itive alarms of re|pre&s;&s;ed
con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s&mdash;&endq; A deep glow, which
hoated his face, forced him here to break off; and,
<PB N="36" REF="37">
abruptly leaving his &s;entence unfini&s;hed, he ha&s;tily
began another.</P>
<P>&startq;We mu&s;t not, neverthele&s;s, regard this as &s;ecu|rity
for the future, though it is &s;afety for the pre&s;ent;
nor tru&s;t her un&s;u&s;picious genero&s;ity of mind to the
dangerous a&s;&s;ault of artful di&s;tre&s;s. I &s;peak without re|&s;erve
of this man; for though I know him not, as &s;he
remon&s;trated, I cannot, from the whole circum&s;tances
of his clande&s;tine conduct, doubt his being an adven|turer
&mdash;You &s;ay nothing? tell me, I beg your opi|nion.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla had not heard one word of this la&s;t &s;peech.
Struck with his di&s;crimination between the actual and the
po&s;&s;ible &s;tate of Eugenia$s mind, and with the effect the
definition had produced upon him&s;elf, her attention was
irre&s;i&s;tibly &s;eized by a new train of ideas, till finding he
waited for an an&s;wer, &s;he mechanically repeated his la&s;t
word &startq;opinion?&endq;</P>
<P>He &s;aw her ab&s;ence of mind, and &s;u&s;pected his own
too palpable di&s;turbance had occa&s;ioned it: but in what
degree, or from what &s;en&s;ations, he could not conjec|ture.
They were both &s;ome time &s;ilent; and then, re|collecting
her&s;elf, &s;he &s;aid it was earne&s;tly her wi&s;h to
avoid di&s;obliging her &s;i&s;ter, by a communication which,
made by any one but her&s;elf, mu&s;t put her into a di&s;|graceful
point of view.</P>
<P>Edgar, after a pau&s;e, &s;aid, they mu&s;t yield, then, to
her pre&s;ent fervour, and hope her &s;ounder judgment,
when le&s;s played upon, would &s;ee clearer. It appear|ed
to him, indeed, that &s;he was &s;o free, at this moment,
from any dangerous impre&s;&s;ion, that it might, perhaps,
be even &s;afer to &s;ubmit quietly to her reque&s;t, than to
urge the generous romance of her temper to new work|ings.
He undertook, mean time, to keep a con&s;tant
watch upon the motions of Bellamy, to make &s;edulous
inquiries into his character and &s;ituation in life, and to
find out for what o&s;ten&s;ible purpo&s;e he was in Hamp|&s;hire:
entreating leave to communicate con&s;tantly to
Camilla what he might gather, and to con&s;ult with her,
from time to time, upon what mea&s;ures &s;hould be pur&s;ued:
<PB N="37" REF="38">
yet ultimately confe&s;&s;ing, that if Eugenia did not &s;teadi|ly
per&s;i&s;t in refu&s;ing any further rejections, he &s;hould
hold him&s;elf bound in con&s;cience to communicate the
whole to Mr. Tyrold.</P>
<P>Camilla was plea&s;ed, and even thankful for the ex|treme
friendline&s;s and kind moderation of this arrange|ment;
yet &s;he left him mournfully, in a confirmed be|lief
his regard for the whole family was equal.</P>
<P>Eugenia, much gratified, promi&s;ed &s;he would hence|forth
take no &s;tep with which Edgar &s;hould not fir&s;t be
acquainted.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Various Con&s;abulations.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Tyrold &s;aw, at fir&s;t, the renewed vi&s;its of Edgar
at Cleves with extreme &s;atisfaction; but while all his
hopes were alive from an intercour&s;e almo&s;t perpetual,
he perceived, with &s;urpri&s;e and perplexity, that his
daughter became more and more pen&s;ive after every
interview: and as Edgar, this evening, quitted the hou&s;e,
he ob&s;erved tears &s;tart into her eyes as &s;he went up
&s;tairs to her own room.</P>
<P>Alarmed and di&s;appointed, he thought it now high
time to inve&s;tigate the &s;tate of the affair, and to en|courage
or prevent future meetings, as it appeared to
him to be propitious or hopele&s;s.</P>
<P>Penetrated with the goodne&s;s, while lamenting the
indifference of Edgar, Camilla had ju&s;t reached her
room; when, as &s;he turned round to &s;hut her door, Mr.
Tyrold appeared before her.</P>
<P>Ha&s;tily, with the back of her hand, bru&s;hing off the
tears from her eyes, &s;he &s;aid, &startq;May I go to my uncle,
Sir?&mdash;can my uncle admit me?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="39">
&startq;He can always admit you,&endq; he an&s;wered; &startq;but,
ju&s;t now, you mu&s;t forget him a moment, and con&s;ign
your&s;elf to your father.&endq;</P>
<P>He then entered, &s;hut the door, and making her &s;it
down by him, &s;aid, &startq;What is this &s;orrow that a&s;&s;ails
my Camilla? Why is the light heart of my dear and
happy child thus dejected?&endq;</P>
<P>Speech and truth&punc; were always one with Camilla$
who, as &s;he could not in this in&s;tance declare what
were her feelings, remained mute and confounded.</P>
<P>&startq;He&s;itate not, my dear girl,&endq; cried he kindly, &startq;to
unbo&s;om your griefs or your apprehen&s;ions, where they
will be received with all the tenderne&s;s due to &s;uch a
confidence, and held &s;acred from every human in&s;pec|tion;
unle&s;s you permit me your&s;elf to entru&s;t your be&s;t

<P>Camilla now trembled, but could not even attempt to
&s;peak.</P>
<P>He &s;aw her di&s;order, and pre&s;ently added, &startq;I will

in you the effect of &s;ecret per&s;onal di&s;turbance,
or of di&s;appointed expectation?&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla could neither an&s;wer nor look up: &s;he was
convinced, by this que&s;tion, that the &s;ubject of her me|lancholy
was under&s;tood, and felt wholly overcome by
the deeply di&s;tre&s;&s;ing confu&s;ion, with which wounded
pride and unaffected virgin mode&s;ty impre&s;s a youthful
female, in the idea of being &s;u&s;pected of a mi&s;placed,
or an unrequited partiality.</P>
<P>Her &s;ilence, a &s;uffocating &s;igh, and her earne&s;t en|deavour
to hide her face, ea&s;ily explained to Mr. Tyrold
all that pa&s;&s;ed within; and re&s;pecting rather than wi&s;h|ing
to conquer a &s;hame flowing from fearful delicacy,
&startq;I would &s;pare you,&endq; he &s;aid, &startq;all inve&s;tigation what|ever,
could I be certain you are not called into any
action; but, in that ca&s;e, I know not that I can ju&s;tify
to my&s;elf &s;o implicit a confidence, in youth and in|experience
&s;o untried in difficulties, &s;o unu&s;ed to evil
or embarra&s;&s;ment as yours. Tell me then, my dear
Camilla, do you &s;igh under the weight of any di&s;ingenu|ous
<PB N="39" REF="40">
conduct? or do you &s;uffer from &s;ome &s;u&s;pence
which you have no means of terminating?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My deare&s;t father, no!&endq; cried &s;he, &s;inking upon
his brea&s;t. &startq;I have no &s;u&s;pence!&endq;</P>
<P>She ga&s;ped for breath.</P>
<P>&startq;And how has it been removed, my child?&endq; &s;aid
Mr. Tyrold, in a mournful tone; &startq;has any deception,
any ungenerous art&punc;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O no, no! he is incapable&mdash;he is &s;uperior&mdash;he&mdash;&endq;
She &s;topt abruptly; &s;hocked at the avowal the&s;e few
words at once inferred of her partiality, of its hopele&s;&s;|ne&s;s,
and of its object.</P>
<P>She walked, confu&s;ed, to a corner of the room, and,
leaning again&s;t the wain&s;cot, enveloped her face in her
handkerchief, with the mo&s;t painful &s;en&s;ations of
&s;hame.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold remained in deep meditation. Her re|gard
for Edgar he had already con&s;idered as undoubted,
and her undi&s;gui&s;ed acknowledgment excited his ten|dere&s;t
&s;ympathy: but to find &s;he thought it without re|turn,
and without hope, penetrated him with grief. Not
only his own fond view of the attractions of his daugh|ter,
but all he had ob&s;erved, even from his childhood,
in Edgar, had induced him to believe &s;he was irre&s;i&s;ti|bly
formed to captivate him; and what had lately
pa&s;&s;ed had &s;eemed a confirmation of all he had expect|ed.
Camilla, neverthele&s;s, exculpated him from all
blame; and, while touched by her artle&s;&s;ne&s;s, and
honouring her truth, he felt, at lea&s;t, &s;ome con&s;olation
to find that Edgar, whom he loved as a &s;on, was un|tainted
by deceit, unaccu&s;ed of any evil. He con|cluded
that &s;ome unfortunate &s;ecret entanglement, or
&s;ome my&s;tery not yet to be developed, directed compul|&s;atorily
his conduct, and checked the dictates of his ta&s;te
and inclination.</P>
<P>Gently, at length, approaching her, &startq;My deare&s;t
child,&endq; he &s;aid, &startq;I will a&s;k you nothing further; all
that is ab&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential for me to know, I have ga|thered.
You will never, I am certain, forget the no|ble
mother whom you are bound to revere in imitating,
nor the affectionate father whom your ingenuou&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="40" REF="41">
renders the mo&s;t indulgent of your friends. Dry up
your tears then, my Camilla, and command your be&s;t
&s;trength to conceal for ever their &s;ource, and, mo&s;t e&s;pe|cially
&mdash;from its cau&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>He then embraced, and left her.</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, my deare&s;t father,&endq; cried &s;he, as &s;he &s;hut the
door. &startq;mo&s;t perfect and mo&s;t lenient of human beings!
yes, I will obey your dictates; I will hide till I can con|quer
this weak emotion, and no one &s;hall ever know,
and Edgar lea&s;t of all that a daughter of yours has a
feeling $word$ $outgh to di&s;gui&s;e!&endq;</P>
<P>Elevated by the kindne&s;s of a father &s;o adored, to
de&s;erve his good opinion now included every wi&s;h. The
lea&s;t &s;everity would have chilled her confidence, the lea&s;t
reproof $ould have di&s;couraged all effort to &s;elf-con|que&s;t;
but, while his &s;oftne&s;s had &s;oothed, his appro|bation
had invigorated her; and her feelings received
additional energy from the con&s;cious genero&s;ity with
which &s;he had repre&s;ented Edgar as blamele&s;s. Blame|le&s;s,
however, in her own brea&s;t, &s;he could not deem
him: his looks, his voice, his manner,&mdash;words that
occa&s;ionally dropt from him, and meanings yet more
expre&s;&s;ive which his eyes or his attentions had taken in
charge, all, from time to time, had told a flattering
tale, which&punc; though timidity and anxious earne&s;tne&s;s
had ob&s;ured from her perfect comprehen&s;ion, her hopes
and her &s;ympathy had prevented from wholly e&s;caping
her. Yet what, internally, &s;he could not defend &s;he
forgave; and, acquitting him of all intentional deceit,
concluded that what he had felt for her, he had thought
too &s;light and immaterial to de&s;erve repre&s;&s;ing on his
own part, or notice on her's. To continue with him
her pre&s;ent &s;i&s;terly conduct was all &s;he had to &s;tudy, not
doubting but that what as yet was effort, would in time
become natural.</P>
<P>Strengthened thus in fortitude, &s;he de&s;cended chear|fully
to &s;upper, where Mr. Tyrold, though he &s;aw with
pain that her &s;pirits were con&s;trained, felt the fonde&s;t
&s;atisfaction in the virtue of her exertion.</P>
<P>Her night pa&s;&s;ed in the con&s;olation of &s;elf-applau&s;e.
My dear father, thought &s;he, will &s;ee I &s;trive to merit his
<PB N="41" REF="42">
and that &s;oothing con&s;ideration with the honour|able
friend&s;hip of Edgar, will be &s;ufficient for the hap|pine&s;s
of my future life, in the &s;ingle and tranquil &s;tate
in which it will be &s;pent.</P>
<P>Thus comforted, &s;he again met the eye of Mr.
Tyrold the next day at breakfa&s;t; in the mid&s;t of which
repa&s;t Edgar entered the parlour. The tea &s;he was
drinking was then rather gulped than &s;ipped; yet &s;he
maintained an air of unconcern, and returned his &s;alu|tation
with apparent compo&s;ure.</P>
<P>Edgar, while addre&s;&s;ing to Mr. Tyrold his inquiries
concerning Sir Hugh, &s;aw, from the window, his &s;er|vant,
whom he had out-gallopped, thrown with vio|lence
from his hor&s;e. He ru&s;hed out of the parlour;
and the fir&s;t per&s;on to ri&s;e, with involuntary intent to
follow him, was Camilla. But, as &s;he reached the
hall-door, &s;he &s;aw that the man was &s;afe, and perceived
that her father was the only per&s;on who had left the
room be&s;ides her&s;elf. A&s;hamed, &s;he returned, and
found the female party collected at the windows.</P>
<P>Hoping to retrieve the error of her eagerne&s;s, &s;he
&s;eated her&s;elf at the table, and affected to fini&s;h her
breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P>Eugenia told her they had di&s;covered the cau&s;e of the
accident, which had been owing to a &s;harp &s;tone that
had penetrated into the hor&s;e's hoof, and which Edgar
was now endeavouring to extract.</P>
<P>A general &s;cream, ju&s;t then, from the window party,
and a cry from Eugenia of &startq;O Edgar!&endq; carried her
again to the hall-door with the &s;wiftne&s;s of lightning,
calling out, &startq;Where?&mdash;What?&mdash;Good Hea|ven!&endq;
&mdash;</P>
<P>Molly Mill, accidentally there before her, &s;aid, as
&s;he approached, that the hor&s;e had kicked Mr. Mandle|bert
upon the &s;houlder.</P>
<P>Every thing but tenderne&s;s and terror was now for|gotten
by Camilla; &s;he darted forward with unre&s;train|ed
velocity, and would have given, in a moment, the
mo&s;t tran&s;porting amazement to Edgar, and to her&s;elf
the deepe&s;t &s;hame, but that Mr. Tyrold, who alone had
his face that way, &s;topt, and led her back to the hou&s;e,
<PB N="42" REF="43">
&s;aying, &startq;There is no mi&s;chief: a bee &s;tung the poor
animal at the in&s;tant the &s;tone was extracted, and the
&s;urpri&s;e and pain made it kick; but, fortunately, without
any bad effect&punc; I wi&s;h to know how your uncle is;
I &s;hould be glad you would go and &s;it with him till I
can come.&endq;</P>
<P>With the&s;e words he left her; and, though aba&s;hed
and over&s;et, &s;he found no &s;en&s;ation &s;o powerful as joy
for the &s;afety of Edgar.</P>
<P>Still, however, too little at ea&s;e for conver&s;ing with
her uncle&punc; &s;he went &s;traight to her own chamber, and
flew involuntarily to a window, whence the fir&s;t object
that met her eyes was her father, who was anxiou&s;ly
looking up. She retreated, utterly confounded and
threw her&s;elf upon a chair at the other end of the
room.</P>
<P>Shame now was her only &s;en&s;ation. The indi&s;cre|tion
of her fir&s;t &s;urprize, &s;he knew he mu&s;t forgive,
though &s;he blu&s;hed at its recollection; but a &s;olicitude
&s;o pertinacious, an indulgence &s;o repeated of feelings
he had enjoined her to combat&mdash;how could &s;he hope
for his pardon? or how obtain her own, to have forfeited
an approbation &s;o precious?</P>
<P>She could not go to her uncle; &s;he would have re|mained
where &s;he was till &s;ummoned to dinner, if the
hou&s;e-maid, after fini&s;hing all her other work, had not
a third time returned to inquire if &s;he might clean her
room.</P>
<P>She then determined to repair to the library, where
&s;he was certain only to encounter Eugenia, who would
not torment, or Dr. Orkborne, who would not perceive
her: but at the bottom of the &s;tairs &s;he was &s;topt by
Mi&s;s Margland, who, with a malicious &s;mile, a&s;ked if
&s;he was going to hold the ba&s;on?</P>
<P>&startq;What ba&s;on?&endq; cried &s;he, &s;urpri&s;ed.</P>
<P>&startq;The ba&s;on for the &s;urgeon.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What &s;urgeon?&endq; repeated &s;he, alarmed.</P>
<P>&startq;Mr. Burton, who is come to bleed Mr. Mandle|bert.&endq;</P>
<P>She a&s;ked nothing more. She felt extremely faint,
but made her way into the park, to avoid further con|ference.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="44">
Here, in the mo&s;t painful &s;u&s;pence, dying for infor|mation,
yet &s;hirking who ever could give it her, &s;he
remained, till &s;he &s;aw the departure of the &s;urgeon.
She then went round by a back way to the apartment of
Eugenia, who informed her that the contu&s;ion, though
not dangerous, was violent, and that Mr. Tyrold had
in&s;i&s;ted upon immediate bleeding. The &s;urgeon had
a&s;&s;ured them this precaution would prevent any ill con|&s;equence;
but Sir Hugh, hearing from the &s;ervants
what had happened, had de&s;ired that Edgar would not
return home till the next day.</P>
<P>The joy of Camilla, that nothing was more &s;erious,
bani&s;hed all that was di&s;agreeable from her thoughts,
till &s;he was called back to reflections le&s;s con&s;oling, by
meeting Mr. Tyrold, as &s;he was returning to her own
room; who, with a gravity unu&s;ual, de&s;ired to &s;peak
with her, and preceded her into the chamber.</P>
<P>Trembling, and filled with &s;hame, &s;he followed,
&s;hut the door, and remained at it without daring to look
up.</P>
<P>&startq;My dear Camilla,&endq; cried he with earne&s;tne&s;s,
&startq;let me not hope in vain for that exertion you have
promi&s;ed me, and to which I know you to be fully
equal. Ri&s;k not, my dear girl, to others, tho&s;e out|ward
marks of &s;en&s;ibility which, to common or unfeel|ing
ob&s;ervers, &s;eem but the effect of an unbecoming re|mi&s;&s;ne&s;s
in the &s;elf-command which &s;hould dignify every
female who would do her&s;elf honour. I had hoped, in
this hou&s;e at lea&s;t, you would not have been mi&s;under|&s;tood;
but I have this moment been undeceived: Mi&s;s
Margland has ju&s;t expre&s;&s;ed a &s;pecies of compa&s;&s;ion for
what &s;he pre&s;umes to be the pre&s;ent &s;tate of your mind,
that has given me the &s;evere&s;t pain.&endq;</P>
<P>He &s;topt, for Camilla looked thunder&s;truck.</P>
<P>Approaching her, then, with a look of concern, and
a voice of tenderne&s;s, he kindly took her hand, and
added: &startq;I do not tell you this in di&s;plea&s;ure, but to put
you upon your guard. You will hear from Eugenia
that we &s;hall not dine alone; and from what I have
dropt you will gather how little you can hope to e&s;cape
&s;crutiny. Exert your&s;elf to obviate all humiliating &s;ur|mi&s;es,
<PB N="44" REF="45">
and you will amply be repaid by the balm of &s;elf|approbation.&endq;</P>
<P>He then ki&s;&s;ed her, and quitted the room.</P>
<P>She now remained in utter de&s;pair: the lea&s;t idea of
di&s;grace totally broke her &s;pirit, and &s;he &s;at upon the
&s;ame &s;pot on which Mr. Tyrold had left her, till the
ringing of the &s;econd dinner bell.</P>
<P>She then gloomily re&s;olved to plead an head-ach,
and not to appear.</P>
<P>When a foot man tapt at her door, to acquaint her
every body was &s;eated at the table, &s;he &s;ent down this
excu&s;e: forming to her&s;elf the further determination,
that the &s;ame &s;hould &s;uffice for the evening, and for
the next morning, that &s;he might avoid the &s;ight of
Edgar, in pre&s;ence either of her father or Mi&s;s Marg|land.</P>
<P>Eugenia, with kind alarm, came to know what was
the matter, and informed her, that Sir Hugh had been
&s;o much concerned at the accident of Edgar, that he
had in&s;i&s;ted upon &s;eeing him, and, after heartily &s;hak|ing
hands, had promi&s;ed to think no more of pa&s;t
mi&s;takes and di&s;appointments, as they had now been
cleared up to the county, and de&s;ired him to take up
his abode at Cleves for a week.</P>
<P>Camilla heard this with mixt plea&s;ure and pain. She
rejoiced that Edgar &s;hould be upon his former terms
with her beloved uncle; but how pre&s;erve the caution
demanded from her for &s;o long a period, in the con|&s;tant
&s;ight of her now watchful father, and the malici|ous
Mi&s;s Margland?</P>
<P>She had added to her own difficulties by this pre|&s;ent
ab&s;conding, and, with &s;evere &s;elf-blame, re&s;olved
to de&s;cend to tea. But, while &s;ettling how to act,
after he &s;i&s;ter had left her, &s;he was &s;truck with hearing
the name of Mandlebert pronounced by Mary, the
hou&s;e-maid, who was talking with Molly Mill upon the
landing place. Why it had been &s;poken &s;he knew not;
but Molly an&s;wered: &startq;Dearee me, never mind; I'll
help you to do his room, if Nanny don't come in time.
My little mi&s;tre&s;s would rather do it her&s;elf, than he
&s;hould want for any thing.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="46">
&startq;Why, it's natural enough,&endq; &s;aid Mary, &startq;for young
ladies to like young gentlemen; and there's none other
comes a nigh 'em, which I often thinks dull enough
for our young mi&s;&s;es. And, to be certain, Mr. Man|dlebert
would be as pretty a match for one of 'em, as a
body could de&s;ire.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And his man,&endq; &s;aid Molly, &startq;is as pretty a gen|tleman
&s;ort of a per&s;on, to my mind, as his ma&s;ter.
I'm &s;ure I'm as glad as my young lady when they comes
to the hou&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, as to Mi&s;s Eugeny,&endq; &s;aid Mary, &startq;I believe,
in my con&s;cience, &s;he likes our cracked-headed old
Doctor as well as e'er a young gentleman in Chri&s;ten|dom;
for there &s;he'll &s;it with him, hour by hour poring
over &s;uch a heap of &s;tuff as never was &s;eed, reading,
fir&s;t one, then t'other, God knows what; for I
believe never nobody heard the like of it before;
and all the time never give the old Doctor a cro&s;s
word.&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;She never given nobody a cro&s;s word,&endq; interrupt|ed
Molly; &startq;if I was Mr. Mandlebert, I'd &s;ooner have
her than any of em, for all &s;he's &s;uch a nidging little
thing.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;For certain,&endq; &s;aid Mary, &startq;&s;he's very good, and a
deal of good &s;he does, to all as a&s;ks her; but Mi&s;s Ca|milla
for my money. She's all alive and merry, and
makes poor ma&s;ter young again to look at her. I wi&s;h
Mr. Mandlebert would have her, for I have overheard
Mi&s;s Margland telling Mi&s;s Lynmere &s;he was de&s;perate
fond of him, and did all &s;he could to get him.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla felt flu&s;hed with the deepe&s;t re&s;entment, and
could &s;carcely command her&s;elf to forbear charging Mi&s;s
Margland with this per&s;ecuting cruelty.</P>
<P>Nanny, the under hou&s;e-maid, now joining them,
&s;aid &s;he had been detained to fini&s;h altering a curtain for
Mi&s;s Margland. &startq;And the cro&s;s old Frump,&endq; &s;he
added, &startq;is in a wor&s;e &s;pite than ever, and &s;he kept
abu&s;ing that &s;weet Mr. Mandlebert to Mi&s;s Lynmere
all the while, till &s;he went down to dinner, and &s;he &s;aid
&s;he was &s;ure it was all Mi&s;s Camilla's doings his &s;tay|ing
here again, for &s;he could come over ma&s;ter for any
<PB N="46" REF="47">
thing: and &s;he &s;aid &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed it was to have another
catch at the young 'Squire's heart, but &s;he hoped he
would not be &s;uch a fool.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I'm &s;ure I wi&s;h he would,&endq; cried Molly Mill, &startq;if
it was only to &s;pite her, &s;he's &s;uch a na&s;ty old viper.
And Mi&s;s Camilla's always &s;o good-natured, and &s;o
affable, &s;he'd make him a very agreeable wife, I dare
&s;ay.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And &s;he's mortal fond of him, that's true,&endq; &s;aid
Mary, &startq;for when they was both here, I always &s;ee
her a running to the window, to &s;ee who was a coming
into the park, when he was rode out; and when he
was in the hou&s;e, &s;he never &s;o much as went to peep,
if there come &s;ix hor&s;es, one after t'other. And &s;he
was always &s;aying `Mary, who's in the parlour? Mary,
who's below?' while he was here; but before he come,
duce a bite did &s;he a&s;k about nobody.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I like when I meets her,&endq; &s;aid Molly Mill, &startq;to
tell her Mr. Mandlebert's here&punc; Mi&s;s; or Mr. Mandle|bert's
there, Mi&s;s;&mdash;Dearee me, one may almo&s;t &s;ee
one &s;elf in her eyes, it makes them &s;hine &s;o.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla could endure no more; &s;he aro&s;e, and walk|ed
about the room; and the maids, who had con|cluded
her at dinner, hearing her &s;tep, hurried away,
to fini&s;h their go&s;&s;ping in the room of Mandlebert.</P>
<P>Camilla now felt wholly &s;unk; the per&s;ecutions of
Mi&s;s Margland &s;eemed nothing to this blow: they were
cruel, &s;he could therefore repine at them; they were un|provoked,
&s;he could therefore repel them: but to find her
&s;ecret feelings, thus generally &s;pread, and familiarly com|mented
upon, from her own unguarded conduct, exhau&s;t|ed,
at once, patience, fortitude, and hope, and left her
no wi&s;h but to quit Cleves while Edgar &s;hould remain
there.</P>
<P>Certain, however, that her father would not permit
her to return to Etherington alone, a vi&s;it to Mrs. Arl|bery
was the &s;ole refuge &s;he could &s;ugge&s;t; and &s;he
determined to &s;olicit his permi&s;&s;ion to accept immediate|ly
the invitation of that lady.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Dodging.</HEAD>
<P>CAMILLA waited in the apartment of Mr. Tyrold
till he came up &s;tairs, and then begged his leave to &s;pend
a few days at the Grove; hinting, when he he&s;itated,
though with a confu&s;ion that was hardly &s;hort of torture,
at what had pa&s;&s;ed among&s;t the &s;ervants.</P>
<P>He heard her with the tendere&s;t pity, and the kinde&s;t
prai&s;e of her &s;incerity; and, deeply as he was &s;hocked
to find her thus generally betrayed, he was too com|pa&s;&s;ionate
to point out, at &s;o &s;uffering a moment, the in|di&s;cretions
from which &s;uch ob&s;ervations mu&s;t have ori|ginated.
Yet he &s;aw con&s;equences the mo&s;t unplea&s;ant
in this rumour of her attachment; and though he &s;till
privately hoped that the behaviour of Mandlebert was
the effect of &s;ome tran&s;ient embarra&s;&s;ment, he wi&s;hed
her removed from all intercour&s;e with him that was not
&s;ought by him&s;elf, while the incertitude of his inten|tions
militated again&s;t her &s;truggles for indifference.
The re&s;ult, therefore, of a &s;hort deliberation was to ac|cede
to her reque&s;t.</P>
<P>Camilla then wrote her propo&s;ition to Mrs. Arlbery,
which Mr. Tyrold &s;ent immediately by a &s;table-boy of
the baronet's.</P>
<P>The an&s;wer was mo&s;t obliging; Mrs. Arlbery &s;aid
&s;he would her&s;elf fetch her the next morning, and keep
her till one of them &s;hould be tired.</P>
<P>The relief which this, at fir&s;t, brought to Camilla, in
the week's exertions it would &s;pare, was &s;oon &s;ucceed|ed
by the mo&s;t acute unea&s;ine&s;s for the critical &s;ituation
of Eugenia, and the undoubted di&s;approbation of Ed|gar.
To quit her &s;i&s;ter at a period when &s;he might &s;erve
her;&mdash;to for&s;ake Cleves at the moment Edgar was re|&s;tored
to it, &s;eemed &s;elfi&s;h even to her&s;elf, and to him
<PB N="48" REF="49">
mu&s;t appear unpardonable. &startq;Alas!&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;how
for ever I repent my ha&s;ty actions! Why have I not
better &s;truggled again&s;t my unfortunate feelings?&endq;</P>
<P>She now almo&s;t hated her whole &s;cheme, regretted
its &s;ucce&s;s, wi&s;hed her&s;elf &s;uffering every unea&s;ine&s;s Mi&s;s
Margland could inflict, and all the &s;hame of being
watched and pitied by every &s;ervant in the hou&s;e, in
preference to de&s;erting Eugenia, and making Mandle|bert
deem her unworthy. But &s;elf-upbraiding was all
that followed her contrition: Mrs. Arlbery was to fetch
her by appointment; and it was now too late to trifle
with the conceding goodne&s;s of her father.</P>
<P>She did not dare excu&s;e her&s;elf from appearing at
breakfa&s;t the next morning le&s;t Mr Tyrold &s;hould
think her utterly incorrigible to his exhortations.</P>
<P>Edgar earne&s;tly inquired after her health as &s;he en|tered
the room; &s;he &s;lightly an&s;wered &s;he was better;
and began eating, with an apparent eagerne&s;s of appe|tite:
while he, who had expected &s;ome kind words
upon his own accident, &s;urpri&s;ed and di&s;appointed, could
&s;wallow nothing.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold, &s;eeing and pitying what pa&s;&s;ed in her
mind, gave her a commi&s;&s;ion, that enabled her, &s;oon,
to leave the room without affectation; and, happy to
e&s;cape, &s;he determined to go down &s;tairs no more till
Mrs. Arlbery arrived. She wi&s;hed to have conver&s;ed
fir&s;t upon the affairs of Eugenia with Edgar: but to
name to him whither &s;he was her&s;elf going, when &s;he
could not po&s;&s;ibly name why; to give to him a &s;urpri&s;e
that mu&s;t recoil upon her&s;elf in di&s;approbation, wa~s
more than &s;he could endure. She had inve&s;ted him
with full powers to coun&s;el and to cen&s;ure her; he
would naturally u&s;e them to di&s;&s;uade her from a vi&s;it
&s;o ill-timed; and what could &s;he urge in oppo&s;ition to
his arguments that would not &s;eem trifting or wilful?</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent moment was all that occupied, the pre|&s;ent
evil all that ever alarmed the brea&s;t of Camilla:
to avoid him, therefore, now, was the whole of her de|&s;ire,
unmole&s;ted with one anxiety how &s;he might better
meet him hereafter.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="50">
She watched at her window till &s;he &s;aw the groom of
Mrs. Arlbery gallop into the Park. She ha&s;tened then
to take leave of Sir Hugh, whom Mr. Tyrold had pre|pared
for her departure; but, at the door of his apart|ment,
&s;he encountered Edgar.</P>
<P>&startq;You are going out?&endq; cried he, perceiving an altera|tion
in her dre&s;s.</P>
<P>&startq;I am&mdash;ju&s;t going to&mdash;to &s;peak to my uncle,&endq; cried
&s;he, &s;tammering and entering the room at the &s;ame
moment.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh kindly wi&s;hed her much amu&s;ement, and
hoped &s;he would make him long amends when he was
better. She took leave; but again, on the landing-|place,
met Edgar, who, anxious and perplexed, watch|ed
to &s;peak to her before &s;he de&s;cended the &s;tairs.
Eagerly advancing &startq;Do you walk?&endq; he cried; &startq;may
I a&s;k? or&mdash;am I indi&s;creet?&endq;</P>
<P>She an&s;wered &s;he had &s;omething to &s;ay to Eugenia,
but &s;hould be back in an in&s;tant. She then flew to the
chamber of her &s;i&s;ter, and conjured her to con&s;ult Edgar
in whatever &s;hould occur during her ab&s;ence. Eugenia
&s;olemnly con&s;ented.</P>
<P>Jacob pre&s;ently tapped at the door, to announce that
Mrs. Arlbery was waiting below in her carriage.</P>
<P>How to pa&s;s or e&s;cape Edgar became now her great|e&s;t
difficulty; &s;he could &s;ugge&s;t nothing to palliate to
him the &s;tep &s;he was taking, yet could &s;till le&s;s bear to
leave him to wild conjecture and certain blame: and &s;he
was &s;tanding irre&s;olute and thoughtful, when Mr. Tyrold
came to &s;ummon her.</P>
<P>After mildly repre&s;enting the indecorum of detain|ing
any one &s;he was to receive by appointment, he took
her apart, and putting a packet into her hand, &startq;I
would not,&endq; he &s;aid, &startq;agitate your &s;pirits this morn|ing,
by entering upon any topic that might di&s;turb you:
I have therefore put upon paper what I mo&s;t de&s;ire you
to con&s;ider. You will find it a little &s;ermon upon the
difficulties and the conduct of the female heart. Read
it alone, and with attention. And now, my deare&s;t
girl, go quietly into the parlour, and let one brief and
cheerful good-morrow &s;erve for every body alike.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="51">
He then returned to his brother.</P>
<P>She made Eugenia accompany her down &s;tairs, to
avoid any &s;olitary attack from Edgar; he &s;uffered them
to pa&s;s; but followed to the parlour, where &s;he ha&s;tily
bid adieu to Mi&s;s Margland and Indiana; but was &s;topt
from running off by the former, who &s;aid, &startq;I wi&s;h I
had known you intended going out, for I de&s;igned
a&s;king Sir Hugh for the chariot for my&s;elf this morning,
to make a very particular vi&s;it.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, in a he&s;itating voice, &s;aid &s;he &s;hould not u&s;e
her uncle's chariot.</P>
<P>&startq;You walk then?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No,&mdash;ma'am&mdash;but&mdash;there is&mdash;there is a carriage
I believe, now at the door.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O dear, who&s;e?&endq; cried Indiana; &startq;do, pray, tell
me where you are going?&endq; while Edgar&punc; &s;till more cu|rious
than either, held out his hand to conduct her, that
he might obtain better information.</P>
<P>&startq;I am very glad your head-ach is &s;o well,&endq; &s;aid Mi&s;s
Margland; &startq;but, pray&mdash;is Mr. Mandlebert to be your
chaperon?&endq;</P>
<P>They both blu&s;hed, though both affected not to hear
her: but, before they could quit the room, Indiana,
who had run to a bow-window, exclaimed, &startq;Dear!
if there it not Mrs. Arlbery in a beautiful high phea|ton!&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar, a&s;toni&s;hed, was now as involuntarily drawing
back, as Camilla, involuntarily, was hurrying on: but
Mi&s;s Margland, in&s;i&s;ting upon an an&s;wer, de&s;ired to
know if &s;he &s;hould return to dinner?</P>
<P>She &s;tammer out, No. Mi&s;s Margland pur&s;ued her
to a&s;k at what time the chariot was to fetch her; and
forced from her a confe&s;&s;ion that &s;he &s;hould be away for
&s;ome days.</P>
<P>She was now permitted to proceed. Edgar, impre&s;&s;|ed
with the deepe&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure, leading her in &s;ilence
acro&s;s the hall: but, &s;topping an in&s;tant at the door,
&startq;This excur&s;ion,&endq; he gravely &s;aid, &startq;will re&s;cue you
from no little intended importunity: I had purpo&s;ed tor|menting
you, from time to time, for your opinion and
directions with re&s;pect to Mi&s;s Eugenia.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="52">
And then, bowing coldly to Mrs. Arlbery, who eager|ly
called out to welcome her, he placed her in the phae|ton,
which in&s;tantly drove off.</P>
<P>He looked after them for &s;ome time, almo&s;t incre|dulous
of her departure: but, as his amazement &s;ub|&s;ided
into certainty, the mo&s;t indignant di&s;appointment
&s;ucceeded. That &s;he could leave Cleves at the very mo|ment
he was rein&s;tated in its &s;ociety, &s;eemed convic|tion
to him of her indifference; and that &s;he could
leave it in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the affairs of Eugenia,
made him conclude her &s;o great a &s;lave to the love of
plea&s;ure, that every duty and all propriety were to be
&s;acrified to its pur&s;uit. &startq;I will think of her,&endq; cried
he. &startq;no more! She concealed from me her plan,
le&s;t I &s;hould torment her with admonitions: the glaring
homage of the Major is better adapted to her ta&s;te,&mdash;
She flies from my &s;incerity to receive his adulation,&mdash;
I have been deceived in her di&s;po&s;ition,&mdash;I will think
of her no more!&endq;</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Sermon.</HEAD>
<P>THE kind reception of Mrs. Arlbery, and all the
animation of her di&s;cour&s;e, were thrown away upon
Camilla. An ab&s;ent &s;mile, and a few faint acknow|ledgments
of her goodne&s;s were all &s;he could return:
Eugenia abandoned when &s;he might have been &s;erved,
Edgar contemning when he might have been approving
&mdash;the&s;e were the images of her mind, which re&s;i&s;ted
entrance to all other.</P>
<P>Tired of fruitle&s;s attempts to amu&s;e her, Mrs. Arl|bery,
upon their arrival at the Grove, conducted her
to an apartment prepared for her, and made u&s;e of no
<PB N="52" REF="53">
per&s;ua&s;ion that &s;he would leave it before din|ner.</P>
<P>Camilla then, too unhappy to fear any injunction, and
re&s;igned to whatever &s;he might receive, read the di&s;|cour&s;e
of Mr. Tyrold.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>For Mi&s;s Camilla Tyrold.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not my intention to enumerate, my dear Ca|milla,
the many ble&s;&s;ings of your &s;ituation; your heart is
ju&s;t and affectionate, and will not forget them: I mean
but to place before you your immediate duties, &s;atisfied
that the review will en&s;ure their performance.</P>
<P>Unu&s;ed to, becau&s;e unde&s;erving control, your days,
to this period, have been as gay as your &s;pirits It is
now fir&s;t that your tranquillity is ruffled; it is now,
therefore, that your fortitude has its fir&s;t debt to pay for
its hitherto happy exemption.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who weigh the calamities of life only by the
po&s;itive, the &s;ub&s;tantial, or the irremediable mi&s;chiefs
which they produce, regard the fir&s;t &s;orrows of early
youth as too trifling for compa&s;&s;ion. They do not
enough con&s;ider that it is the &s;uffering, not its ab&s;tract
cau&s;e, which demands human commi&s;eration. The man
who lo&s;es his whole fortune, yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es firmne&s;s, phi|lo&s;ophy,
a di&s;dain of ambition, and an accommodation to
circum&s;tances, is le&s;s an object of contemplative pity,
than the per&s;on who, without one real deprivation, one
actual evil, is fir&s;t, or is &s;uddenly forced to recogni&s;e
the fallacy of a cheri&s;hed and darling hope.</P>
<P>That its foundation has always been &s;hallow is no mi|tigation
of di&s;appointment to him who had only viewed
it in its &s;uper&s;tructure. Nor is its downfal le&s;s ter|rible
to its vi&s;ionary elevator, becau&s;e others had &s;een
it from the beginning as a folly or a chimera; its di&s;&s;o|lution
&s;hould be e&s;timated, not by its romance in the
unimpa&s;&s;ioned examination of a rational looker-on, but
by its believed promi&s;e of felicity to its credulous pro|jector.</P>
<P>Is my Camilla in this predicament? had &s;he wove her
own de&s;tiny in the &s;peculation of her wi&s;hes? Alas! to
blame her, I mu&s;t fir&s;t forget, that delu&s;ion, while in
<PB N="53" REF="54">
force, has all the &s;emblance of reality, and takes the &s;ame
hold upon the faculties as truth. Nor is it till the &s;pell
is broken, till the perver&s;ion of rea&s;on and error of
judgment become wilful, that Scorn ought to point &startq;its
finger&endq; or Cen&s;ure its &s;everity.</P>
<P>But of this I have no fear. The love of right is im|planted
indelibly in your nature, and your own peace is
as dependant as mine and as your mother&punc;s upon its con|&s;tant
culture.</P>
<P>Your conduct hitherto has been committed to your|&s;elf.
Satisfied with e&s;tabli&s;hing your principles upon
the adamantine pillars of religion and con&s;cience, we
have not feared leaving you the entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of ge|neral
liberty. Nor do I mean to withdraw it, though
the pre&s;ent &s;tate of your affairs, and what for &s;ome time
pa&s;t I have painfully ob&s;erved of your precipitance, oblige
me to add partial coun&s;el to &s;tanding precept, and ex|hortation
to advice. I &s;hall give them, however, with
diffidence, fairly acknowledging and blending my own
perplexities with yours.</P>
<P>The temporal de&s;tiny of woman is enwrapt in &s;till
more impenetrable ob&s;curity than that of man. She be|gins
her career by being involved in all the worldly ac|cidents
of a parent; &s;he continues it by being a&s;&s;ociated
in all that may environ a hu&s;band: and the difficulties
ari&s;ing from this doubly appendant &s;tate, are augmented
by the next to impo&s;&s;ibility, that the fir&s;t dependence
&s;hould pave the way for the ultimate. What parent yet
has been gifted with the fore&s;ight to &s;ay, &startq;I will edu|cate
my daughter for the &s;tat$on to which &s;he &s;hall be|long?&endq;
Let us even &s;uppo&s;e that &s;tation to be fixed by
him&s;elf, rarely as the chances of life authori&s;e &s;uch a
pre&s;umption; his daughter all duty, and the partner of
his own &s;election &s;olicitous of the alliance: is he at all
more &s;ecure he has provided even for her external wel|fare?
What, in this &s;ublunary exi&s;tence, is the &s;tate from
which &s;he &s;hall neither ri&s;e nor fall? Who &s;hall &s;ay that
in a few years, a fe$ months, perhaps le&s;s, the &s;ituation
in which the pro&s;perity of his own views has placed
her, may not change for one more humble than he has
&s;itted her for enduring, or more exalted than he has ac|compli&s;hed
<PB N="54" REF="55">
her for &s;u&s;taining? The con&s;cience, indeed,
of the father is not re&s;pon&s;ible for events, but the infeli|city
of the daughter is not le&s;s a &s;ubject of pity.</P>
<P>Again, if none of the&s;e outward and obvious vici$$i|tudes
occur, the proper education of a female, either for
u&s;e or for happine&s;s, is &s;till to &s;eek, &s;till a problem be|yond
human &s;olution; &s;ince its refinement, or its negli|gence,
can only prove to her a good or an evil, accor|ding
to the humour of the hu&s;band into who&s;e hands &s;he
may fall. If fa&s;hioned to &s;hine in the great world, he
may deem the metropolis all turbulence; if endowed
with every re&s;ource for retirement, he may think the
country di&s;ta&s;teful. And though her talents, her ac|quirements,
may in either of the&s;e ca&s;es be &s;et a&s;ide,
with an only &s;ilent regret of wa&s;ted youth and appli|cation;
the turn of mind which they have induced, the
appreciation which they have taught of time, of plea|&s;ure,
or of utility, will have nurtured inclinations and
opinions not &s;o d$ctile to new &s;entiments and employ|ments,
and either &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion becomes a hard&s;hip, or re|&s;i&s;tance
generates di&s;&s;ention.</P>
<P>If &s;uch are the parental embarra&s;&s;ments, again&s;t which
neither wi&s;dom nor experience can guard, who &s;hould
view the filial without &s;ympathy and tenderne&s;s?</P>
<P>You have been brought up, my dear child, without
any &s;pecific expectation. Your mother and my&s;elf, mu|tually
deliberating upon the uncertainty of the female
fate, determined to educate our girls with as much &s;im|plicity
as is compatible with in&s;truction, as much doci|lity
for various life as may accord with invariable prin|ciples,
and as much accommodation with the world at
large, as may combine with a ju&s;t di&s;tinction of &s;elected
&s;ociety We hoped thus, &s;hould your lots be elevated,
to &s;ecure you from either exulting arrogance, or ba&s;hful
in&s;ignificance; or &s;hould they, as is more probable, be
lowly, to in&s;til into your under&s;tandings and characters
&s;uch a portion of intellectual vigour as &s;hould make you
enter into an humbler &s;cene without deba&s;ement, help|le&s;sne&s;s,
or repining.</P>
<P>It is now&punc; Camilla, we mu&s;t demand your exertions
in return. Let not the&s;e cares, to &s;it you for the world
<PB N="55" REF="56">
as you may find it, be utterly annihilated from doing you
good, by the uncombated &s;way of an unavailing, how|ever
well-placed attachment</P>
<P>We will not here canva&s;s the equity of that freedom
by which women as well as men &s;hould be allowed to
di&s;po&s;e of their own affections There cannot, in na|ture,
in theory, nor even in common &s;en&s;e, be a doubt of
their equal right: but di&s;qui&s;itions on this point will re|main
rather curious than important, till the &s;peculati&s;t
can &s;uperinduce to the ab&s;tract truth of the po&s;ition &s;ome
proof of its practicability.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, it is enough for every mode&s;t and rea|&s;onable
young woman to con&s;ider, that where there are
two parties, choice can belong only to one of them: and
then let her call upon all her feelings of delicacy, all her
notions of propriety, to decide: Since Man mu&s;t choo&s;e
Woman, or Woman Man, which &s;hould come forward
to make the choice? Which &s;hould retire to be cho&s;en?</P>
<P>A prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion directed towards a virtuous and de|&s;erving
object wears, in its fir&s;t approach the appearance
of a mere tribute of ju&s;tice to merit. It &s;eems, there|fore,
too natural, perhaps too generous, to be con&s;ider|ed
either as a folly or a crime. It is only its encou|ragement
where it is not reciprocal, that can make it in|cur
the fir&s;t epithet, or where it ought not to be reci|procal
that can brand it with the &s;econd. With re&s;pect
to this la&s;t, I know of nothing to apprehend:&mdash;with re|gard
to the fir&s;t&mdash;I grieve to wound my deare&s;t Ca|milla,
yet where there has been no &s;ubject for complaint,
there can have been none for expectation.</P>
<P>Struggle then again&s;t your&s;elf as you would &s;truggle
again&s;t an enemy. Refu&s;e to li&s;ten to a wi&s;h, to dwell
even upon a po&s;&s;ibility, that opens to your pre&s;ent idea
of happine&s;s. All that in future may be reali&s;ed prob|ably
hangs upon this conflict. I mean not to propo&s;e to
you in the cour&s;e of a few days to rein&s;tate your&s;elf in
the perfect &s;ecurity of a di&s;engaged mind I know too
much of the hum$n heart to be ignorant that the accele|ration,
or delay&punc; mu&s;t depend upon circum&s;tance: I can
only require from you what depends upon your&s;elf, a
&s;teady and courageous warfare again&s;t the two dange|rous
<PB N="56" REF="57">
underminers of your peace and of your fame, im|prudence
and impatience. You have champions with
which to encounter them that cannot fail of &s;ucce&s;s,&mdash;
good &s;en&s;e and delicacy.</P>
<P>Good &s;en&s;e will &s;hew you the power of &s;elf-conque&s;t,
and point out its means. It will in&s;truct you to curb
tho&s;e unguarded movements which lay you open to the
&s;trictures of others. It will talk to you of tho&s;e boun|daries
which cu&s;tom forbids your &s;ex to pa&s;s, and the
hazard of any individual attempt to tran&s;gre&s;s them.
It will tell you, that where allowed only a negative
choice, it is your own be&s;t intere&s;t to combat again&s;t a
po&s;itive wi&s;h. It will bid you, by con&s;tant occupation,
vary tho&s;e thoughts that now take but one direction, and
multiply tho&s;e intere&s;ts which now recogni&s;e but one
object: and it will &s;oon convince you, that it is not
&s;trength of mind which you want, but reflection, to
obtain a &s;trict and unremitting controul over your pa&s;|&s;ions.</P>
<P>This la&s;t word will pain, but let it not &s;hock you.
You have no pa&s;&s;ions, my innocent girl, at which you
need blu&s;h, though enough at which I mu&s;t tremble!&mdash;
For in what con&s;i&s;ts your con&s;traint, your forbearance?
your wi&s;h is your guide, your impul&s;e is your action.
Alas! never yet was mortal created &s;o perfect, that
every wi&s;h was virtuous, or every impul&s;e wi&s;e!</P>
<P>Does a &s;ecret murmur here demand: if a di&s;cerning
predilection is no crime, why, internally at lea&s;t, may
it not be cheri&s;hed? whom can it injure or offend, that
in the hidden rece&s;&s;es of my own brea&s;t, I nouri&s;h &s;u|perior
preference of &s;uperior worth?</P>
<P>This is the que&s;tion with which every young woman
beguiles her fancy; this is the common but &s;eductive
opiate, with which inclination lulls rea&s;on.</P>
<P>The an&s;wer may be &s;afely compri&s;ed in a brief appeal
to her own brea&s;t.</P>
<P>I do not de&s;ire her to be in&s;en&s;ible to merit; I do not
even demand &s;he &s;hould confine her &s;ocial affections to
her own &s;ex, &s;ince the mo&s;t innocent e&s;teem is equally
compatible, though not equally general with ours. I re|quire
of her &s;imply, that, in her &s;ecret hours, when pride
<PB N="57" REF="58">
has no dominion, and di&s;gui&s;e would an&s;wer no purpo&s;e,
&s;he will a&s;k her&s;elf this que&s;tion, &startq;Could I calmly hear
that this elect of my heart was united to another?
Were I to be informed that the indi&s;&s;oluble knot was
tied, which annihilates all my own future po&s;&s;ibilities,
would the news occa&s;ion me no affliction?&endq; This, and
this alone, is the te&s;t by which &s;he may judge the dan|ger,
or the harmle&s;&s;ne&s;s of her attachment.</P>
<P>I have now endeavoured to point out the obligations
which you may owe to good &s;en&s;e. Your obligations to
delicacy will be but their con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Delicacy is an attribute &s;o peculiarly feminine, that
were your reflections le&s;s agitated by your feelings you
could delineate more di&s;tinctly than my&s;elf its appro|priate
laws, its minute exactions, its &s;en&s;itive refine|ments.
Here, therefore, I &s;eek but to bring back to
your memory what livelier &s;en&s;ations have inadvertently
driven from it.</P>
<P>You may imagine, in the innocency of your heart,
that what you would rather peri&s;h than utter can never,
&s;ince untold, be &s;u&s;pected: and&punc; at pre&s;ent, I am equally
&s;anguine in believing no &s;urmi&s;e to have been conceived
where mo&s;t it would &s;hock you: yet credit me when I
a&s;&s;ure you, that you can make no greater mi&s;take, than
to &s;uppo&s;e that you have any &s;ecurity beyond what &s;edu|lou&s;ly
you mu&s;t earn by the mo&s;t indefatigable vigilence.
There are &s;o many ways of communication independent
of &s;peech, that &s;ilence is but one point in the ordina$ces
of di&s;cretion. You have nothing, in &s;o mode&s;t a cha|racter,
to apprehend from vanity or pre&s;umption; you
may ea&s;ily, therefore, continue the guardian of your own
dignity: but you mu&s;t keep in mind, that our percep|tions
want but little quickening to di&s;cern what m$$ flat|ter
them; and it is mutual to either &s;ex to be to no gra|tification
&s;o alive, as to that of a con&s;cious a&s;cendance
over$the other.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, the female who, upon the &s;oftening
blandi&s;hment of an undi&s;gui&s;ed prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, builds
her expectation of its reciprocity$ is, in common,
mo&s;t cruelly deceived. It is not that &s;he has failed to
awaken tenderne&s;s; but it has been tenderne&s;s without
<PB N="58" REF="59">
re&s;pect: nor yet that the per&s;on thus elated has been
in&s;en&s;ible to flattery; but it has been a flattery to rai&s;e
him&s;elf, not its exciter in his e&s;teem. The partiality
which we feel in&s;pires diffidence: that which we create
has a contrary effect. A certainty of &s;ucce&s;s in many
de&s;troys, in all weakens, its charm: the ba&s;hful ex|cepted,
to whom it gives courage; and the indolent,
to whom it &s;aves trouble.</P>
<P>Carefully, then, beyond all other care, &s;hut up every
avenue by which a &s;ecret which &s;hould die untold
can further e&s;cape you. Avoid&punc; every &s;pecies of par|ticularity;
neither &s;hun nor &s;eek any intercour&s;e ap|parently;
and in &s;uch meetings as general prudence
may render nece&s;&s;ary, or as accident may make in|evitable,
endeavour to behave with the &s;ame open e&s;teem
as in your days of uncon&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s. The lea&s;t un|u&s;ual
attention would not be more &s;u&s;picious to the
world, than the lea&s;t undue re&s;erve to the &s;ubject of
our di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. Coldne&s;s or di&s;tance could only be im|puted
to re&s;entment; and re&s;entment, &s;ince you have
received no offence, how, &s;hould it be inve&s;tigated,
could you vindicate? or how, &s;hould it be pa&s;&s;ed in &s;i|lence,
&s;ecure from being attributed to pique and di&s;ap|pointment?</P>
<P>There is al&s;o another motive, important to us all,
which calls for the mo&s;t rigid circum&s;pection. The
per&s;on in que&s;tion is not merely amiable: he is al&s;o
rich: mankind at large, therefore would not give merely
to a &s;en&s;e of excellence any obvious predi$ection. This
hint will, I know, powerfully operate upon your di&s;|intere&s;ted
&s;pirit.</P>
<P>Never from per&s;onal experience may you gather,
how far from &s;oothing, how wide from honourable,
is the &s;pecies of compa&s;&s;ion ordinarily diffu&s;ed by the
di&s;covery of an unreturned female regard. That it
&s;hould be $elt un&s;ought may be con&s;idered as a mark of
di&s;cerning &s;en&s;ibility; but that it &s;hould be betrayed un|called
for, is commonly, however ungenerou&s;ly, ima|gined
rather to indicate ungoverned pa&s;&s;ions, than re|fined
&s;election. This is often both cruel and unju&s;t;
yet, let me a&s;k&mdash;Is the world a proper confident for
<PB N="59" REF="60">
&s;uch a &s;ecret? Can the woman who has permitted it to
go abroad, rea&s;onably demand that con&s;ideration and
re&s;pect from the community, in which &s;he has been
wanting to her&s;elf? To me it would be unnece&s;&s;ary to
ob&s;erve, that her indi&s;cretion may have been the effect
of an inadvertence which owes its origin to artle&s;&s;ne&s;s,
not to forwardne&s;s: She is judged by tho&s;e, who, hard
ened in the ways of men, accu&s;tom them&s;elves to trace
in evil every motive to action; or by tho&s;e who, pre|ferring
ridicule to humanity, &s;eek rather to amu&s;e them+&s;elves
wittily with her &s;u&s;ceptibility, than to feel for
its innocence and &s;implicity.</P>
<P>In a &s;tate of utter con&s;traint, to appear natural is,
however, an effort too difficult to be long &s;u&s;tained;
and neither precept, example nor di&s;po&s;ition, have en|ured
my poor child to the performance of any &s;tudied
part. Di&s;criminate, neverthele&s;s, between hypocri&s;y
and di&s;cretion. The fir&s;t is a vice; the &s;econd a con|ciliation
to virtue. It is the bond that keeps &s;ociety
from di&s;union; the v$il that &s;ha$es our weakne&s;s from
expo&s;ure giving time for that interior correction, which
the publication of our infirmities would el&s;e, with re&s;|pect
to mankind, make of no avail.</P>
<P>It were better no doubt, wor$$ier, nobler, to meet
the &s;crutiny of our fellow-creatures by con&s;ent, as we
encounter, per force, the all-viewing eye of our Crea|tor:
but &s;ince for this we are not &s;ufficiently without
blemi&s;h, we mu&s;t allow to our un&s;table virtues all the
encouragement that can prop them&punc; The event of di&s;|covered
faults is more frequently callou&s;ne&s;s than amend|ment;
and propriety of example is as much a duty to
our fellow-creatures, as purity of intention is a debt to
our&s;elves.</P>
<P>To delicacy, in fine, your pre&s;ent exertions will owe
their future recompence, be your ultimate lot in life
what it may. Should you in the cour&s;e of time, be|long
to another, you will be &s;hielded from the regret
that a former attachment had been publi&s;hed; or &s;hould
you continue mi&s;tre&s;s of your&s;elf, from a blu&s;h that the
world is acquainted it was not by your choice.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="61">
I &s;hall now conclude this little di&s;cour&s;e by calling
upon you to annex to whatever I have offered you of
precept&punc; the con&s;tant remembrance of your mother for
example.</P>
<P>In our joint names, therefore, I adjure you, my
deare&s;t Camilla, not to embitter the pre&s;ent innocence
of your &s;uffering by imprudence that may attach to
it cen&s;ure, nor by indulgence that may make it fa&s;ten
upon your vitals! Imprudence cannot but end in the
demolition of that dignified equanimity, and mode&s;t
propriety, which we wi&s;h to be uniformly remarked
as the attributes of your character: and indulgence,
by fixing, may envenom a dart that as yet may be
gently withdrawn, from a wound which kindne&s;s may
heal, and time may clo&s;e: but which, if neglected, may
wear away, in corroding di&s;turbance, all your life's
comfort to your&s;elf, and all its &s;ocial purpo&s;es to your
friends and to the world.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Chat.</HEAD>
<P>THE calm &s;adne&s;s with which Camilla had opened
her letter was &s;oon broken in upon by the intere&s;t of its
contents, the view it di&s;played of her duties, her &s;hame
at her failures, and her fears for their future execution;
and yet more than all, by the full deci&s;ion in which it
&s;eemed written, that the unhappy partiality &s;he had ex|po&s;ed,
had been always, and would for ever remain
unreturned.</P>
<P>She &s;tarted at the intimation how near &s;he &s;tood to
detection even from Edgar him&s;elf, and pride, rea&s;on,
<PB N="61" REF="62">
mode&s;ty, all aro&s;e to &s;trengthen her with re&s;olution,
to guard every future conflict from his ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>The article concerning fortune touched her to the quick.
Nothing appeared to her &s;o degrading as the mo&s;t di&s;|tant
idea that &s;uch a circum&s;tance could have any force
with her. But the ju&s;tice done to Edgar &s;he gloried in,
as an apology for her feelings, and exculpatory of her
weakne&s;s. Her tears flowed fa&s;t at every expre&s;&s;ion
of kindne&s;s to her&s;elf, her burning blu&s;hes dried them
up as they were falling&punc; at every hint of her feeblene&s;s,
and the hopele&s;&s;ne&s;s of its cau&s;e; but wholly &s;ubdued
by the la&s;t paragraph, which with reverence &s;he pre&s;&s;ed
to her lips, &s;he offered up the mo&s;t &s;olemn vows of a
&s;trict and entire ob&s;ervance of every injunction which
the letter contained.</P>
<P>She was thus employed, unnoticing the pa&s;&s;age of
time, when Mrs. Arlbery tapped at her door, and
a&s;ked if &s;he wi&s;hed to dine in her own room.</P>
<P>Surpri&s;ed at the que&s;tion, and a&s;hamed to be thus
&s;een, &s;he was beginning a thou&s;and apologies for not
being yet dre&s;&s;ed: but Mrs. Arlbery, interrupting her,
&s;aid, &startq;I never li&s;ten to excu&s;es. 'Tis the only battery
that overpowers me. If, by any mi&s;chance, and in an
evil hour, &s;ome country cou&s;in, not knowing my ways,
or &s;ome antediluvian prig&punc; not minding them, happen
to fall upon me with formal &s;peeches, where I can
make no e&s;cape, a fit of yawning takes me immediately,
and I am demoli&s;hed for the re&s;t of the day.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, attempting to &s;mile, promi&s;ed to play the
country cou&s;in no more. Mrs. Arlbery then ob&s;erved
&s;he had been weeping; and taking her hand, with an
examining look, &startq;My lovely young friend,&endq; &s;he cried,
&startq;this will never do!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What, ma'am?&mdash;how?&mdash;what?&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Nay, nay, don't be frightened. Come down to
dinner, and we'll talk over the hows? and the whats?
afterwards. Never mind your dre&s;s; we go no where
this evening; and I make a point not to &s;uffer any body to
change their attire in my hou&s;e, merely becau&s;e the af|ternoon
is taking place of the morning. It &s;eems to me
a mi&s;erable compliment to the mi&s;tre&s;s of a man&s;ion, to
<PB N="62" REF="63">
&s;ee her gue&s;ts only equip them&s;elves for the table. For
my part, I deem the garb that is good enough for me,
good enough for my ge$&s;e and turkies&mdash;apple and oy|&s;ter-&s;auce
included.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla then followed her do$n &s;tairs, where &s;he
found no company but Sir Sedley Clarendel.</P>
<P>&startq;Come, my dear Mi&s;s T$rold,&endq; &s;aid Mrs. Arlbery,
&startq;you and I may now con&s;ider our&s;elves as <HI>t&ecirc;te-&acirc;-t&ecirc;te;</HI>
Sir Sedley won't be much in our way. He hears and
&s;ees nothing but him&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ec&s;tatically flattering that!&endq; cried Sir Sedley;
&startq;dulcet to every nerve!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, I know you li&s;ten ju&s;t now, becau&s;e you are
your&s;elf my theme But the moment I take another,
you will forget we are either of $s in the room.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Inhuman to the quick!&endq; cried he; &startq;barbarous to
a point!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This is a creature &s;o &s;trange. Mi&s;s Tyrold,&endq; &s;aid
Mrs. Arlbery, &startq;that I mu&s;t po&s;itively initiate you a
little into his character;&mdash;or, rather, into its own cari|cature;
for as to character, he has had none intelligible
the&s;e three years. See but how he &s;miles at the very
pro&s;pect of being portrayed, in defiance of all his efforts
to look unconcerned! yet he knows I &s;hall &s;hew him
no mercy. But, like all other egoti&s;ts, the only thing
to really di&s;concert him, would be to take no notice of
him. Make him but the fir&s;t &s;ubject of di&s;cour&s;e, and
prai&s;e or abu&s;e are pretty much the &s;ame to him.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O &s;hocking! &s;hocking! killing pa&s;t re&s;u&s;citation!
Abominably horrid, I prote&s;t&punc;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O I have not begun yet. This is an ob&s;ervation
to &s;uit thou&s;ands. But do not fear; you &s;hall have all
your appropriations. Mi&s;s Tyrold&punc; you are to be audi|tor
and judge: and I will &s;ave you the time and the
trouble which decyphering this animal, &s;o truly a non|de&s;cript,
might co&s;t you.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What a tremendous exordium! di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to a de|gree!
I am agued with trepidation!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O you wretch! you know you are enchanted. But
no further interruption! I &s;end you to Coventry for the
next ten minutes.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="64">
&startq;This man, my dear Mi&s;s Tyrold, whom we are
about to delineate, was meant by nature, and prepared,
by art, for &s;omething greatly &s;uperior to what he now
appears: but, unhappily, he had neither &s;olidity of judg|ment,
nor humility of di&s;po&s;ition, for bearing meekly
the early advantages with which he &s;et out in life; a
fine per&s;on, fine parts, and a &s;ine e&s;tate, all da&s;hed into
con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s at the pre&s;uming age of one and twenty.
By this aggregate of wealthy, of mental and of per&s;onal
pro&s;perity, he has become at once &s;elf &s;poilt and world
&s;poilt. Had you known him, as I have done, before he
was &s;eized with this &s;y&s;tematic affectation&punc; which, I am
&s;atisfied, cau&s;es him more &s;tudy than the united pedants
of both univer&s;ities could inflict upon him, you would
have &s;een the mo&s;t delightful creature breathing! a
creature combining, in one animated compo&s;ition, the
very $&s;&s;ences of &s;pirit, of gaiety, and of intelligence.
But now, with every thing within his reach, nothing
&s;eems worth his attainment. He has not &s;ufficient
energy to make u&s;e of his own powers. He has no one
to command him, and he is too indolent to command
him&s;elf He has therefore turned fop from mere wan|tonne&s;s
of time and of talents; from having nothing to
do, no one to care for, and no one to plea&s;e. Take
from him half his wit, and by le&s;&s;ening his pre&s;umption,
you will cure him of all his folly. Rob him of his for|tune,
and by forcing him into exertion, you will make
him one of the fir&s;t men of his day. Deface and maim
his features and figure, and by letting him &s;ee that to ap|pear
and be admired is not the &s;ame thing, you will ren|der
him irre&s;i&s;tible.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Have you done?&endq; cried the baronet &s;miling.</P>
<P>&startq;I prote&s;t,&endq; &s;aid Mrs. Arlbery, I believe you are a
little touched! And I don't at all want to reform you.
A perfect character only lulls me to &s;leep.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Obliging in the &s;uperlative! I mu&s;t then take as a
con&s;olation that I have never given you a nap?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Never, $ larendel, I a&s;&s;ure you; and yet I don't
hate you! Vice is dete&s;table; I bani&s;h all its appear|ances
from my coteries; and I would bani&s;h its reality,
too, were I &s;ure I &s;hould then have any thing but empty
<PB N="64" REF="65">
chairs in my drawing-room&mdash;but foibles make all the
charm of &s;ociety. They are the only &s;upport of con|vivial
raillery, and dome&s;tic wit. If formerly, there|fore,
you more excited my admiration, it is now, be|lieve
me, you contribute mo&s;t to my entertainment.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Condoling to a phenomenon! I have really, then,
the va&s;tly prodigious honour to be exalted in your fair
graces to the level of a mountebank? a quack doctor,
his merry Andrew? or any other &s;uch re&s;pectable buf|foon?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Piqued! piqued! I declare! this exceeds my high|e&s;t
ambition. But I mu&s;t not weaken the impre&s;&s;ion by
dwelling upon it.&endq;</P>
<P>She then a&s;ked Camilla if &s;he had any me&s;&s;age for
Cleves, as one of her &s;ervants was going clo&s;e to the
park gate.</P>
<P>Camilla, glad to withdraw, &s;aid &s;he would write a few
words to her father, and retired for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>&startq;What in the world, my dear Clarendel,&endq; &s;aid Mrs.
Arlbery, 'can I do with this poor thing? She has lo&s;t
all her &s;prightline&s;s&punc; and vapours me but to look at her.
She has all the &s;ymptoms upon her of being in the full
meridian of that common girli&s;h di&s;ea&s;e, an hopele&s;s
pa&s;&s;ion&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Poor little tender dove!&endq; cried the baronet.
&startq;'Twould be odious to cure her. Unfeeling to exce&s;s.
What in nature can be half &s;o melli&s;iuou&s;ly intere&s;ting?
I &s;hall now look at her with mo&s;t prodigious &s;oftne&s;s.
Ought one not to &s;igh as &s;he approaches?</P>
<P>`The matter to be &s;ure is &s;illy enough, an&s;wered
Mrs. Arlbery; &startq;but, this non&s;en&s;e apart, &s;he is a char|ming
girl. Be&s;ides, I perceive I am a violent favourite
with her; an flattery, my dear Clarendel, will work its
way, even with me! I really owe her a good turn: El&s;e
I &s;hould no longer endure her; for the tender pa&s;&s;ion
has terribly flattened her. If we can't re&s;tore her &s;pi|rits,
&s;he will be a mere dead weight to me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O a very cru&s;h! a cannon ball would be a butterfly
in the compari&s;on! But who is the irre&s;i&s;tible? What
form has the little blind traitor a&s;&s;umed?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="66">
&startq;O, a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf, that of the fir&s;t young man who
has come in her &s;ight. Every dam&s;el, as &s;he enters the
world, has &s;ome picture ready painted upon her imagi|nation,
of an object worthy to en&s;lave her: and before
any experience forms her judgment, or any compari&s;on
her ta&s;te, &s;he is the dupe of the fir&s;t youth who pre&s;ents
him&s;elf to her, in the firm per&s;ua&s;ion of her ductile
fancy, that he is ju&s;t the model it had previou&s;ly cre|ated.&endq;</P>
<P>She then added, &s;he had little doubt but young Man|dlebert
was the hero, from their private conferences af|ter
the raffle, and from her blu&s;hes when forced to name
him.</P>
<P>&startq;Nay, nay, this is not of the fir&s;t incongruity!&endq; &s;aid
the young baronet, &startq;not romantic to outrage. Beech
park has nothing very horrific in it. Nothing invinci|bly
beyond the &s;tandard of a young lady's philo&s;opy.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Depend upon it, that's the very idea its ma&s;ter has
conceived of the matter him&s;elf. You wealthy Cava|liers
rarely want flappers to remind you of your ad|vantages.
That Mandlebert, you mu&s;t know, is my
aver&s;ion. He has ju&s;t that air and reputation of fault|le&s;&s;ne&s;s
that gives me the &s;pleen. I hope, for her &s;ake,
he won't think of her; he will lead her a terrible life.
A man who piques him&s;elf upon his perfections, finds
no mode &s;o convenient and ready for di&s;playing them,
as proving all about him to be con&s;tantly in the wrong.
However, a character of that &s;tamp rarely marries; e&s;|pecially
if he is rich, and has no ob&s;tacles in his way.
What can I do, then, for this poor thing? The very
nature of her malady is to make her entertain fal&s;e
hopes. I am quite bent upon curing them. The only
difficulty, according to cu&s;tom, is how. I wi&s;h you
would take her in hand your&s;elf&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I?&mdash;prepo&s;terous in the extreme! what particle of
chance &s;hould I have again&s;t Mandlebert?</P>
<P>&startq;O you vain wretch! to be &s;ure you don't know,
that though he is rich, you are richer? and, doubtle&s;s,
you never took notice, that though he is hand&s;ome, you
are hand&s;omer? As to manners, there is little to choo&s;e
between you, for he is as much too correct, as you are
<PB N="66" REF="67">
too fanta&s;tic. In conver&s;ation, too, you are nearly upon
a par, for he is as regularly too right, as you are ridi|culou&s;ly
too wrong,&mdash;but O the charm of dear amu&s;ing
wrong, over dull commanding $word$! you have but to
addre&s;s your&s;elf to her with a little &s;lattering di&s;tinction,
and Mandlebert ever after will appear to her a pe|dant.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What a wicked &s;ort of &s;prite is a female wit!&endq;
cried Sir Sedley, &startq;breathing only in mi&s;chief! a very
will-o'-the-wi&s;p, per&s;onified and pe$$$$oated&punc; &s;hining but
to lead a&s;tray. Dangerous $word$ all f$$hom! Have the
goodne&s;s, however, my fair J$$k-o'-lan$horn, to inti|mate
what you mean I &s;hould do with this langui&s;hing
dulcinea, &s;hould I deliver her from $word$? You don't
advi&s;e me, I pre&s;ume, to take unto my&s;elf a wife? I
prote&s;t I am &s;hivered to the utmo&s;t point north at the
bare &s;ugge&s;tion! frozen to an $word$!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, no; I know you far too confirmed an egoti&s;t
for any thing but an old bachelor. Nor is there the
lea&s;t nece&s;&s;ity to yoke the poor child to the conjugal
plough &s;o early. The only &s;acrifice I demand from you
is a little attention; the only good I aim at for her, is
to open her eyes, which have now a film before them,
and to let her &s;ee that Mandlebert has no other pre-emi|nence,
than that of having been the fir&s;t young man with
whom &s;he became acquainted. Never imagine I want
her to fall in love with you. Heaven help the poor
victim to &s;uch a complication of caprice!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Nay, now I am full &s;outh again! burning with
&s;hame and choler! How you navigate my &s;en&s;ations
from cold to heat at plea&s;ure! Cooke was a mere river
waterman to you. My blood chills or boils at your com|mand.
Every &s;entence is a new climate. You waft
me from extreme to extreme, with a rapidity ab&s;olutely
dizzying. A balloon is a broad-wheeled waggon to
you.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Come, come&punc; jargon apart, will you make your&s;elf
of any u&s;e? The cure of a romantic fir&s;t flame is a better
&s;urety to &s;ub&s;equent di&s;cretion, than all the exhortations
of all the fathers, and mothers, and guardians, and
maiden aunts in the univer&s;e. Save her now, and you
<PB N="67" REF="68">
&s;erve her for life;&mdash;be&s;ides giving me prodigious plea|&s;ure
in robbing that frigid Mandlebert of &s;uch a con|que&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Unhappy young &s;wain! I pity him to immen&s;ity.
How has he fallen thus under the rigour of your wrath?
Do you bani&s;h him your favour, like another Ari&s;tides,
to relieve your ear from hearing him called the Ju&s;t?</P>
<P>&startq;Was ever allu&s;ion &s;o impertinent? or, what is
wor&s;e, for aught I can determine&punc; &s;o true? for, certain|ly,
he has given me no offence; yet I feel I &s;hould be
enchanted to humble him. Don't be concerned for him,
however; you may a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf he hates me There
is a certain &s;pring in our propen&s;ities to one another,
that involuntarily opens and &s;huts in almo&s;t exact har|mony,
whether of approbation or antipathy. Except,
indeed, in the one article of love, which, di&s;tingui&s;hing
nothing&punc; is ready to gra&s;p at any thing.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But why have you not recour&s;e to the gallant cock|ade?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The Major? O, I have ob&s;erved, already, &s;he re|ceives
his devoirs without emotion; which, for a girl
who has &s;een nothing of the world, is re&s;pectable
enough, his red coat con&s;idered. Whether the man
has any meaning him&s;elf, or whether he knows there is
&s;uch a thing, I cannot tell: but as I do not wi&s;h to &s;ee
her &s;urrounded with brats, while a mere brat her&s;elf, it
is not worth inquiry. You are the thing, Clarendol,
the very thing! You are ju&s;t agreeable enough to annul
her puerile fa&s;cination, yet not intere&s;ting enough to in|volve
her in any new danger.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Flattering pa&s;t imitability! divine Arlberiana!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Girls, in general,&endq; continued &s;he, &startq;are in&s;upport|able

and unea&s;y, &s;carce let him even &s;ee any one el&s;e. But
the hor&s;es having taken fright, while they were in a
great crowd, Bellamy had per&s;uaded Mi&s;s Margland to
alight, while the coach pa&s;&s;ed a terrible concour&s;e of car|riages;
and, in that interval, he had contrived to whi&s;|per
a claim upon her tacit promi&s;e of viewing the chai&s;e
which was for ever to convey him away from her; and,
though her engagement to Edgar made her refu&s;e, he
had drawn her, &s;he knows not her&s;elf how, from her
party, and, while &s;he was angrily remon&s;trating, and
he &s;eemed in the utmo&s;t de&s;pair at her di&s;plea&s;ure, Ed|gar,
who had been at fir&s;t eluded by being on hor&s;e|back,
di&s;mounted, forced his way to her, and almo&s;t
carried her back to the coach, leaving Bellamy, who
&s;he was &s;ure had no &s;ini&s;ter de&s;ign, nearly dead with
grief at being unworthily &s;u&s;pected. Edgar, &s;he how|ever
added, was fixed in believing he meant to con|vey
her away; and Jacob, a&s;&s;erting he &s;aw him pur|po&s;ely
frighten the hor&s;es, had told his &s;urmi&s;es to Sir
Hugh; which he had corroborated by an account that
the &s;ame gentleman had &s;topt to conver&s;e with her in her
la&s;t return from Etherington. Sir Hugh, terri&s;ied, had
declared he would no longer live without Clermont
upon the &s;pot. She had felt too much for his di&s;tur|bance
to oppo&s;e him at the moment, but had not imagin|ed
his plan would immediately be put into execution,
till, early this morning, he had &s;ent for her, and pro|duced
his letter of recall, which had taken him, he &s;aid,
the whole night to compo&s;e and fini&s;h. Urged by &s;ur|pri&s;e
and di&s;&s;atisfaction, &s;he was beginning a little re|mon&s;trance;
but found it made him &s;o extremely un|happy,
that, in the fear of a relap&s;e, &s;he de&s;i&s;ted; and,
with a &s;hock &s;he knew not when &s;he &s;hould overcome,
&s;aw the fatal letter delivered for the po&s;t.</P>
<P>Camilla, with much commi&s;eration, inquired if &s;he
had con&s;ulted with Edgar. Yes, &s;he an&s;wered; and
he had extorted her permi&s;&s;ion to relate the whole
tran&s;action to her father, though in a manner wide from
<PB N="70" REF="71">
ju&s;tice to the ill-fated Bellamy; who&s;e de&s;ign might be
extraordinary, but who&s;e character, &s;he was convinced,
was honourable.</P>
<P>Camilla, who&s;e education, though private, had not,
like that of Eugenia, been &s;ecluded and &s;tudious, was
far le&s;s credulous than her &s;i&s;ter, though equally artle&s;s.
She knew, too, with regard to this affair, the opinion of
Edgar, and to know and be guided by it was imper|ceptibly
one. She declared her&s;elf, therefore, openly
again&s;t Bellamy, and made her motives con&s;i&s;t in a com|mentary
upon his proceedings.</P>
<P>Eugenia warmly defended him, declaring the judg|ment
of Camilla, and that of all her friends, to be
formed in the dark; for that none of them could have
doubted a moment his goodne&s;s or his honour, had they
&s;een the di&s;tracted &s;uffering that was marked in his coun|tenance.</P>
<P>&startq;And what,&endq; cried Camilla, &startq;&s;ays my father to all
this?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He &s;ays ju&s;t what Edgar &s;ays: he is all that is
kind and good, but he has never beheld Bellamy&mdash;how,
then, &s;hould be know him?&endq;</P>
<P>A me&s;&s;age came now from Sir Hugh to Camilla, that
he would &s;ee her before &s;he went, but that he was re&s;ting
at pre&s;ent from the fatigue of writing a letter. He &s;ent
her, however, with his love, the foul copy, to amu&s;e her
till &s;he could come to him.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>To Clermont Lynmere E&s;&abque;.
Dear Nephew,</OPENER>
<P>I HAVE had a very dangerous illne&s;s, and the doctors
them&s;elves are all &s;urpri&s;ed that I recovered; but a
greater doctor than them was plea&s;ed to &s;ave me, for
which I thank God. But as this attack has made me
think more than ever I thought before, I am willing to
turn my thoughts to good account.</P>
<P>Now, as I have not the gift of writing, at which,
thank God, I have left off repining, from the rea&s;on of
its great trouble&s;omene&s;s in acquiring, I can't pretend
<PB N="71" REF="72">
to any thing of a fine letter, but &s;hall proceed to bu&s;i|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>My dear Clermont, I write now to de&s;ire you would
come over out of hand; which I hope you won't take
unkind, foreign parts being no great plea&s;ure to &s;ee, in
compari&s;on of old England; be&s;ides which, I have
another apology to offer, which is, having a &s;ine prize
in view for you; which is the more e&s;&s;ential, owing to
&s;ome unlucky circum&s;tances, in which I did not behave
quite as well as I wi&s;h, though very unwillingly; which
I mention to you as a warning. However, you have
no need to be ca&s;t down, for this prize will &s;et all right,
and make you as rich as a lord, at the &s;ame time that you
are as wi&s;e as a philo&s;opher. And as learning, though
I have the proper re&s;pect for it, won't &s;erve to make
the pot boil, you mu&s;t needs be glad of more &s;ub&s;tantial
fuel; for there's no living upon air, however you
&s;tudents may affect to think eating mere gluttony.</P>
<P>Now, this prize is no other than your cou&s;in Eugenia
Tyrold, whom I don't tell you is a beauty; but if you
are the &s;en&s;ible lad I take you for, you won't think the
wor&s;e of her for wanting &s;uch &s;rail perfections. Be|&s;ides,
we &s;hould not be too nice among&s;t relations, for
if we are, what can we expect from the wide world?
So I beg you to come over with all convenient &s;peed,
for fear of her falling a prey to &s;ome &s;harper, many &s;uch
being to be found; e&s;pecially at hor&s;e-races, and &s;o
forth.</P>
<CLOSER>I remain,
Dear nephew,
Your affectionate uncle,
<SIGNED>HUGH TYROLD.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Eugenia, from motives of delicacy and of &s;hame, de|clined
reading the copy as &s;he had declined reading the
letter; but looked &s;o extremely unhappy, that Camilla
offered to plead with her uncle, and u&s;e her utmo&s;t in|fluence
that he would countermand the recall.</P>
<P>&startq;No,&endq; an&s;wered &s;he, &startq;no! 'tis a point of duty and
gratitude, and I mu&s;t bear its con&s;equences.&endq;</P>
<P>She was now called down to Mr. Tyrold. Camilla
accompanied her.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="73">
He told her had gathered, from the kind zeal and
inquiries of Edgar, that Bellamy had certainly laid a
premeditated plan for carrying her off, if &s;he went to
the races; which, as the whole neighbourhood was there,
might rea&s;onably be expected.</P>
<P>Eugenia, with &s;ervour, prote&s;ted &s;uch wickedne&s;s was
impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>&startq;I am unwilling, my dear child,&endq; he an&s;wered,
&startq;to adulterate the purity of your thoughts and expec|tations,
by inculcating &s;u&s;picions; but, though nature
has ble&s;&s;ed you with an uncommon under&s;tanding, re|member,
in judgment you are &s;till but fifteen, and in
experience but a child. One thing, however, tell me
candidly, Is it from love of ju&s;tice, or is it for your
happine&s;s you combat thus ardently for the integrity of
this young man?</P>
<P>&startq;For my ju&s;tice, Sir!&endq; &s;aid &s;he firmly.</P>
<P>&startq;And no latent rea&s;on mingles with and enforces
it?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;None, believe me! &s;ave only what gratitude dic|tates.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If your heart, then, is your own, my dear girl, do
not be unea&s;y at the letter to Clermont. Your uncle
is the la&s;t man upon earth to put any con&s;traint upon
your inclinations; and need I add to my deare&s;t Eu|genia,
I am the la&s;t father to thwart or di&s;tre&s;s them?
Re&s;ume, therefore, your courage and compo&s;ure; be
ju&s;t to your friends, and happy in your&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P>Rea&s;on was never thrown away upon Eugenia. Her
mind was a &s;oil which received and naturalized all that
was &s;own in it. She promi&s;ed to look forward with
more cheerfulne&s;s, and to dwell no longer upon this agi|tating
tran&s;action.</P>
<P>Edgar now came in. He was going to Beech Park
to meet Bellamy. He was charged with a long me&s;&s;age
for him from Sir Hugh; and an order to inform him
that his niece was engaged; which, however, he de|clined
undertaking, without fir&s;t con&s;ulting her.</P>
<P>This was almo&s;t too &s;evere a trial of the duty and for|titude
of Eugenia. She coloured, and was quitting
the room in &s;ilence: but pre&s;ently turning back, &startq;My
<PB N="73" REF="74">
uncle,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;is too ill now for argument, and he
is too dear to me for oppo&s;ition:&mdash;Say, then, ju&s;t what
you think will mo&s;t conduce to his tranquillity and re|covery.&endq;</P>
<P>Her father embraced her; Camilla &s;hed tears; and
Edgar, in earne&s;t admiration, ki&s;&s;ed her hand. She re|ceived
their applau&s;e with &s;en&s;ibility, but looked down
with a &s;ecret deduction from its force, as &s;he internally
uttered, &startq;My ta&s;k is not &s;o difficult as they believe I
touched as I am with the con&s;tancy of Bellamy&mdash;It is
not Melmond who loves me! it is not Melmond I re|ject!&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar was immediately &s;etting off, but &s;topping him
&mdash;&startq;One thing alone I beg,&endq; &s;he &s;aid; &startq;do not com|municate
your intelligence abruptly. Soften it by a&s;&s;ur|ances
of my kind wi&s;hes.&mdash;Yet, to prevent any de|ception,
any future hope&mdash;&s;ay to him&mdash;if you think it
right&mdash;that I &s;hall regard my&s;elf, henceforward, as if
already in that holy &s;tate &s;o &s;acred to one only ob|ject.&endq;</P>
<P>She blu&s;hed, and left them, followed by Camilla.</P>
<P>&startq;If born but ye&s;terday,&endq; cried Mr. Tyrold, while
his eyes gli&s;tened, &s;he could not be more perfectly free
from guile&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yet that,&endq; &s;aid Edgar, &startq;is but half her prai&s;e;
&s;he is perfectly free, al&s;o, from &s;elf! &s;he is made up of
di&s;intere&s;ted qualities and liberal &s;en&s;ations. To the
mo&s;t genuine &s;implicity, &s;he joins the mo&s;t &s;ingular phi|lo&s;ophy;
and to knowledge and cultivation, the mo&s;t un|common,
adds all the mode&s;ty as well as innocence of
her extreme youth and inexperience.&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold &s;ub&s;cribed with frankne&s;s to this ju&s;t
prai&s;e of his highly-valued daughter; and they then con|ferred
upon the &s;teps to be taken with Bellamy, whom
neither of them &s;crupled to pronounce a mere fortune|hunter.
All the inquiries of Edgar were ineffectual to
learn any particulars of his &s;ituation. He &s;aid he was
travelling for his amu&s;ement; but he had no recom|mendation
to any one; though, by being con&s;tantly
well dre&s;&s;ed, and keeping a &s;hewy footman, he had con|trived
to make acquaintance almo&s;t univer&s;ally in the
<PB N="74" REF="75">
neighbourhood. Mr. Tyrold determined to accom|pany
Edgar to Beech Park him&s;elf, and there, in the
mo&s;t peremptory terms, to a&s;&s;ure him of the &s;erious
mea&s;ures that would en&s;ue, if he de&s;i&s;ted not from his
pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>He then went to take leave of Camilla, who had been
making a vi&s;it to her uncle, and was returning to the
Grove.</P>
<P>He had &s;een with concern the frigid air with which
Edgar $ad bowed to her upon his entrance, and with
compa&s;&s;ion the changed countenance with which &s;he
had received his formal &s;alutation. His hope of the
alliance now &s;unk; and &s;o favourite a wi&s;h could not be
relinqui&s;hed without &s;evere di&s;appointment; yet his
own was immaterial to him when he looked at Ca|milla,
and &s;aw in her expre&s;&s;ive eyes the &s;truggle of
her &s;oul to di&s;gui&s;e her wounded feelings. He now
regretted that &s;he had not accompanied her mother
abroad; and de&s;ired nothing &s;o earne&s;tly as any means
to remove her from all intercour&s;e with Mandlebert.
He &s;econded, therefore, her &s;peed to be gone, happy
&s;he would be placed where exertion would be indi&s;pen|&s;able;
and gently, yet clearly, intimated his wi&s;h that
&s;he &s;hould remain at the Grove, till &s;he could meet
Edgar without rai&s;ing pain in her own bo&s;om, or excit|ing
&s;u&s;picions in his. Cruelly mortified, &s;he &s;ilently
acquie&s;ced. He then &s;aid whatever was mo&s;t kind to
give her courage; but, dejected by her con&s;cious failure,
and afflicted by the change in Edgar, &s;he returned to
Mrs. Arlbery in a &s;tate of mind the mo&s;t melan|choly.</P>
<P>And here, nothing could be le&s;s exhilarating nor le&s;s
&s;ea&s;onable than the fir&s;t news &s;he heard.</P>
<P>The regiment of General Kin&s;ale was ordered into
Kent, in the neighbourhood of Tunbridge: It was
the &s;ea&s;on for drinking the water of that &s;pring; and Mr.
Dennel was going thither with his daughter. Sir Sed|ley
Clarendel conceived it would be &s;erviceable al&s;o to
his own health; and had &s;uddenly propo&s;ed to Mrs.
Arlbery forming a party to pa&s;s a few weeks there.
With a vivacity always ready for any new project,
<PB N="75" REF="76">
&s;he in&s;tantly agreed to it, and the journey was &s;ettled
to take place in three days. When Camilla was in|formed
of this intended excur&s;ion, the di&s;appointment
with which it overpowered her was too potent for di&s;|gui&s;e:
and Mrs. Arlbery was &s;o much &s;truck with it,
that, during coffee, &s;he took Sir Sedley apart, and &s;aid;
&startq;I feel &s;uch concern for the di&s;mal alteration of that
&s;weet girl, that I could prevail with my&s;elf, all love|lorn
as &s;he is, to take her with me to Tunbridge, if
you will aid my hardy enterpri&s;e of driving that frozen
compo&s;ition of premature wi&s;dom from her mind. If
you are not as invulnerable as him&s;elf, you cannot refu&s;e
me this &s;leight of gallantry.&endq;</P>
<P>Sir Sedley gave a laughing a&s;&s;ent&punc; declaring, at the
&s;ame time, with the &s;tronge&s;t profe&s;&s;ed diffidence, his
con&s;cious inability. Mrs. Arlbery, in high &s;pirits,
&s;aid &s;he &s;carce knew which would mo&s;t delight her, to
mortify Edgar, or re&s;tore Camilla to gaiety and inde|pendance.
Yet &s;he would watch, &s;he &s;aid, that mat|ters
went no further than ju&s;t to &s;hake off a whining fir&s;t
love; for the la&s;t thing upon earth &s;he intended was to
entangle her in a &s;econd.</P>
<P>Camilla received the invitation with plea&s;ure yet
anxiety: for though glad to be &s;pared returning to
Cleves in a &s;tate of di&s;turbance &s;o &s;u&s;picious, &s;he was
bitterly agitated in reflecting upon he di&s;like of Edgar
to Mrs. Arlbery, the pains he had taken to prevent
her mingling with the &s;ociety, and the probably final
period to his e&s;teem and good-will, that would prove
the re&s;ult of her accompanying &s;uch a party to a place
of amu&s;ement.</P>

<P>MRS. Arlbery accompanied Camilla the next day
to Cleves, to a&s;k permi&s;&s;ion of Mr. Tyrold for the ex|cur&s;ion.
She would tru&s;t the reque&s;t to none but her|&s;elf,
con&s;cious of powers of per&s;ua&s;ion unu&s;ed to re|pul&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the propo&s;ition: he was
not &s;atisfied in tru&s;ting his unguarded Camilla to the
di&s;&s;ipation of a public place, except under the wing of
her mother; though he felt eager to remove her from
Edgar, and rejoiced in any opportunity to allow her a
change of &s;cene, that might revive her natural &s;pi|rits,
and unchain her heart from its unhappy &s;ubjec|tion.</P>
<P>Perceiving him undetermined, Mrs. Arlbery called
forth all her artillery of eloquence and grace, to for|ward
her conque&s;t. The licence &s;he allowed her&s;elf
in common of fanta&s;tic command, gave way to the more
feminine attraction of &s;oft pleading: her &s;atire, which,
though never malignant, was often alarming, was re|linqui&s;hed
for a &s;portive gaiety that diffu&s;ed general
animation; and Mr. Tyrold &s;oon, though not caught
like his daughter, cea&s;ed to wonder that his daughter
had been caught.</P>
<P>In this indeci&s;ion he took Camilla apart, and bad
her tell her him, without fear or re&s;erve, her own feel|ings,
her own wi&s;hes, her own opinion upon this &s;cheme.
She held &s;uch a call too &s;erious and too kind for di&s;|gui&s;e:
&s;he hid her face upon his &s;houlder and wept;
he &s;oothed and encouraged her to confidence; and,
in broken accents &s;he then acknowledged her&s;elf un|equal
as yet, to fulfilling his injunctions of appearing
cheerful and ea&s;y, though &s;en&s;ible of their wi&s;dom.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="78">
Mr. Tyrold, with a heavy heart, &s;aw how much
deeper was her wound, than the airine&s;s of her nature
had prepared him to expect, and could no longer he|&s;itate
in granting his con&s;ent. He &s;aw it was her
wi&s;h to go; but he &s;aw that the plea&s;ures of a public
place had no &s;hare in exciting it. To avoid betraying
her con&s;cious mortification was her &s;ole and innocent
motive; and though he would rather have &s;ent her to
a more private &s;pot, and have tru&s;ted her to a more
retired character; he yet thought it po&s;&s;ible, that
what opportunity pre&s;ented un&s;ought, might, even|tually,
prove more beneficial than what his own choice
would have dictated; for public amu&s;ements, to the
young and unhackneyed, give entertainment without
requiring exertion; and &s;pirits lively as tho&s;e of Mrs.
Arlbery create nearly as much gaiety as they di&s;play.</P>
<P>Fixed&punc; now, for the journey, he carried Camilla
to her uncle to take leave. The pro&s;pect of not &s;ee|ing
her again for &s;ix weeks was gloomy to Sir Hugh,
though he bore it better at this moment, when his fan|cy
was occupied by arranging preparation$ for the re|turn
of Clermont, than he could have done at almo&s;t
any other. He put into her hands a fifty pound Bank
note for her expences, and when, with mingled mo|de&s;ty
and dejection, &s;he would have returned the whole,
as unnece&s;&s;ary even to her wi&s;hes, Mr. Tyrold, inter|fering,
made her accept twenty pounds. Sir Hugh
pre&s;&s;ed forward the original &s;um in vain; his brother,
though always aver&s;e to refu&s;e his &s;malle&s;t de&s;ire,
thought it here a duty to be firm, that the excur&s;ion,
which he granted as a relief to her &s;adne&s;s, might
not lead to plea&s;ures ever after beyond her reach, nor
to their concomitant extravagance. She could not,
he knew, re&s;ide at Tunbridge with the economy and
&s;implicity to which &s;he was accu&s;tomed at Etherington;
but he charged her to let no temptation make her for|get
the moderate income of which alone &s;he was certain;
a&s;&s;uring her, that where a young woman's expences
exceeded her known expectations, tho&s;e who were fore|mo&s;t
to prai&s;e her elegance, would mo&s;t fear to form
any connection with her, and mo&s;t de&s;pi&s;e or deride her
in any calamity.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="79">
Camilla found no difficulty in promi&s;ing the mo&s;t
exact ob&s;ervance of this in&s;truction; her heart &s;eemed
in &s;ackcloth and a&s;hes, and &s;he cared not in what man|ner
her per&s;on &s;hould be arrayed.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh earne&s;tly enjoined her not to fail to be
at Cleves upon the arrival of Clermont&punc; intimating that
the nuptials would immediately take place.</P>
<P>She then &s;ought Eugenia, whom &s;he found with
Dr. Orkborne, in a &s;tate of mind &s;o perfectly calm and
compo&s;ed, as equally to &s;urpri&s;e and rejoice her. She
&s;aw with plea&s;ure that all Bellamy had in&s;pired was the
mo&s;t artle&s;s compa&s;&s;ion; for &s;ince his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion had
now po&s;itively been given, and Clermont was actually
&s;ummoned, &s;he devoted her thoughts &s;olely to the ap|proaching
event&punc; with the firm, though early wi&s;dom
which di&s;tingui&s;hed her character.</P>
<P>Indiana joined them; and, in a low voice, &s;aid to
Camilla, &startq;Pray, cou&s;in, do you know where Mr.
Macder&s;ey is? Becau&s;e I am &s;adly afraid he's dead.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, &s;urpri&s;ed, de&s;ired to know why &s;he had &s;uch
an apprehen&s;ion?</P>
<P>&startq;Becau&s;e he told me he'd &s;hoot him&s;elf through
the brains if I was cruel&mdash;and I am &s;ure I had no great
choice given me: for, between our&s;elves, Mi&s;s Marg|land
gave all the an&s;wers for me, without once &s;topping
to a&s;k me what I &s;hould chu&s;e. So if he has really
done it, the fault is more her's than mine,&endq;</P>
<P>She then &s;aid, that, ju&s;t after Camilla's departure
the preceding day, Mr. Macder&s;ey arrived, and in&s;i&s;t|ed
upon &s;eeing her, and &s;peaking to Sir Hugh, as he
was ordered into Kent, and could not go &s;o far in &s;u&s;|pence.
Sir Hugh was not well enough to admit him;
and Mi&s;s Margland, upon whom the office devolved,
took upon her to give him a po&s;itive refu&s;al; and
though &s;he went into the room while he was there, never
once would let her make an an&s;wer for her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland, &s;he added, had frightened Sir Hugh
into forbidding him the hou&s;e, by comparing him with
Mr. Bellamy; but Mr. Macder&s;cy had frightened
them all enough, in return, as he went away, by &s;aying,
that as &s;oon as ever Sir Hugh was well, he would call
<PB N="79" REF="80">
him out, becau&s;e of his &s;ending him word down &s;tairs
not to come to Cleves any more, for he had been di&s;|turbed
enough already by another Iri&s;h fortune-hunter,
that came after another of his nieces; and he was the
more &s;ure Mr. Macder&s;ey was one of them, becau&s;e of
his being a real Iri&s;hman, while Mr. Bellamy was only
an Engli&s;hman. &startq;But don't you think now, cou&s;in,&endq;
&s;he continued, &startq;Mi&s;s Margland might as well have let
me &s;peak for my&s;elf?&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla inquired if &s;he was &s;orry for the rejec|tion.</P>
<P>&startq;N&ndash;o,&endq; &s;he an&s;wered, with &s;ome he&s;itation; &startq;for
Mi&s;s Margland &s;ays he's got no rent-roll; be&s;ides, I
don't think he's &s;o agreeable as Mr. Melmond; only
Mr. Melmond's worth little or no fortune they &s;ay: for
Mi&s;s Margland inquired about it, after Mr. Mandl$bert
behaved &s;o. El&s;e I can't &s;ay I thought Mr. M$lmond
di&s;agreeable.&endq;</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery now &s;ent to ha&s;ten Camilla, who, in
returning to the parlour, met Edgar. He had ju&s;t ga|thered
her intended excur&s;ion, and, &s;ick at heart, had
left the room. Camilla felt the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of a guil|ty
per&s;on at his &s;ight; but he only &s;lightly bowed; and
coldly &s;aying, &startq;I hope you will have much plea&s;ure at
Tunbridge,&endq; went on to his own room.</P>
<P>And there, replete with re&s;entment for the whole of
her late conduct, he again ble&s;&s;ed Dr. Marchmont for
his pre&s;ervation from her toils; and, concluding the
excur&s;ion was for the &s;ake of the Major, who&s;e regi|ment
he knew to be ju&s;t ordered into Kent, he centered
every former hope in the one &s;ingle wi&s;h that he might
never &s;ee her more.</P>
<P>Camilla, &s;hocked by &s;uch obvious di&s;plea&s;ure, quit|ted
Cleves with &s;till increa&s;ing &s;adne&s;s; and Mrs.
Arlbery would heartily have repented her invitation,
but for her dependance upon Sir Sedley Clarendel.</P>
<P>At Etherington they &s;topt, that Camilla might pre|pare
her package for Tunbridge. Mrs. Arlbery would
not alight.</P>
<P>While Camilla, with a maid-&s;ervant, was examining
her drawers, the chamber door was opened by Lionel,
<PB N="80" REF="81">
for whom &s;he had ju&s;t inquired, and who, telling her
he wanted to &s;peak to her in private, turned the maid
out of the room.</P>
<P>Camilla begged him to be quick, as Mrs. Arlbery was
waiting</P>
<P>&startq;Why then, my dear little girl,&endq; cried he, &startq;the
chief &s;ub&s;tance of the matter is neither more nor le&s;s
than this: I want a little money.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My dear brother,&endq; &s;aid Camilla, plea&s;ure again
kindling in her eyes as &s;he opened her pocket-book,
&startq;you could never have applied to me &s;o opportunely.
I have ju&s;t got twenty pounds, and I do not want
twenty &s;hillings. Take it, I be&s;eech you, any part,
or all&endq;</P>
<P>Lionel pau&s;ed and &s;eemed half choaked. &startq;Ca|milla,&endq;
he cried pre&s;ently, &startq;you are an excellent girl.
If you were as old and ugly as Mi&s;s Margland, I
really believe I &s;hould think you young and pretty.
But this &s;um is nothing. A drop of water to the
ocean&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla now, drawing back, di&s;appointed and di&s;|plea&s;ed,
a&s;ked how it was po&s;&s;ible he &s;hould want
more.</P>
<P>&startq;More, my dear child? why I want two or three
cool hundred.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Two or three hundred? repeated &s;he, amazed.</P>
<P>&startq;Nay, nay, don't be frightened. My uncle will
give you two or three thou&s;and, you know that. And
I really want the money. It's no joke, I a&s;&s;ure you.
It's a ca&s;e of real di&s;tre&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Di&s;tre&s;s? impo&s;&s;ible! what di&s;tre&s;s can you have
to &s;o prodigious an amount?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Prodigious! poor little innocent! do&s;t think two or
three hundred prodigious?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And what is become of the large &s;ums extorted
from my uncle Relvil?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O that was for quite another thing. That was
for debts. That's gone and over. This is for a per|fectly
different purpo&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And will nothing&mdash;O Lionel!&mdash;nothing touch
you? My poor mother's quitting England&mdash;her &s;epa|ration
<PB N="81" REF="82">
from my father and her family&mdash;my uncle Rel|vil's
&s;evere attack&mdash;will nothing move you to more
thoughtful, more prai&s;e-worthy conduct?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Camilla, no preaching! I might as well ca&s;t my|&s;elf
upon the old ones at once. I come to you in pre|ference,
on purpo&s;e to avoid $$rmoni&s;ing. However,
for your &s;atisfaction, and to &s;p$r you to &s;erve me, I
can a&s;&s;ure you I have avoided all new debts &s;ince the la&s;t
little depo&s;it of the poor &s;ick hypocondriac mi&s;er, who
is pining away at the lo&s;s of a few guineas, that he
had neither &s;pirit nor health to have &s;pent for him|&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Is this your rea&s;oning, your repentance, Lionel,
upon &s;uch a cata&s;trophe?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My dear girl, I am heartily concerned at the whole
bu&s;ine&s;s, only, as it's over, I don't like talking of it.
This is the la&s;t &s;crape I &s;hall ever be in while I live.
But if you won't help me, I am undone. You know
your in$luence with my uncle. Do, there's a dear girl,
u&s;e it for your brother? I have not a dependance in the
world&punc; now, but upon you!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Certainly I will do whatever I can for you,&endq; &s;aid
&s;he, &s;ighing; &startq;but indeed, my dear Lionel, your man|ner
of going on makes my very heart ach! However,
let this twenty pounds be in part, and tell me your very
&s;malle&s;t calculation for what mu&s;t be added?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Two hundred. A farthing le&s;s will be of no u&s;e;
and three will be of thrice the &s;ervice. But mind!&mdash;
you mu&s;t not &s;ay it's for me!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;How, then, can I a&s;k for it?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, vamp up &s;ome di&s;mal ditty.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, Lionel!&endq; exclaimed &s;he, turning away from
him; &startq;you propo&s;e what you know to be impractica|ble&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, then, if you mu&s;t needs &s;ay it's for me,
tell him he mu&s;t not for his life own it to the old
ones.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;In the &s;ame breath, mu&s;t I beg and command?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O. I always make that my bargain. I &s;hould el&s;e
be put into the lecture room, and not let loo&s;e again till
I was made a milk&s;op. They'd talk me &s;o into the va|pours,
<PB N="82" REF="83">
I &s;hould not be able to act like a man for a month
to come.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;A man, Lionel?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, a man of the world, my dear; a knowing
one.&endq;</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery now &s;ent to ha&s;ten her, and he extort|ed
a promi&s;e that &s;he would go to Cleves the next morn|ing,
and procure a draft for the money, if po&s;&s;ible, to
be ready for his calling at the Grove in the after|noon,</P>
<P>She felt this more deeply than &s;he had time or cou|rage
to own to Lionel, but her increa&s;ed melancholy
was all imputed to reflections concerning Mandlebert by
Mrs. Arlbery.</P>
<P>That lady lent her chai&s;e the next morning, with her
u&s;ual-promptitude of good-humour, and Camilla went to
Cleves, with a reluctance that never before accompani|ed
her de&s;ire to oblige</P>
<P>Her vi&s;it was received mo&s;t kindly by all the family,
as merely an additional leave taking; in which light,
though &s;he was too &s;incere to place it, &s;he &s;uffered it
to pa&s;s. Having no chance of being alone with her
uncle by accident, &s;he was forced to beg him in a whi&s;|per,
to reque&s;t a <HI>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</HI> with her: and &s;he then,
covered with all the confu&s;ion of a partner in his extra|vagance,
made the petition of Lionel</P>
<P>Sir Hugh &s;eemed much &s;urpri&s;ed, but prote&s;ted he
would rather part with his coat and wai&s;tcoat than re|fu&s;e
any thing to Camilla&punc; He gave her in&s;tantly a
draft upon his banker for two hundred pounds; but
added, he &s;hould take it very kind of her, if &s;he would
beg $ionel to a&s;k him for no more this year, as he was
really &s;o hard run, he &s;hould not el&s;e be able to make
proper preparations for the wedding, till his next rents
became due.</P>
<P>Camilla was now &s;urpri&s;ed in her turn; and Sir
Hugh then confe&s;&s;ed, that, between pre&s;ents and peti|tions,
his nephew had had no le&s;s than five hundred
pounds from him the preceding year, unknown to his
<PB N="83" REF="84">
parents; and that for this year, the &s;um &s;he reque&s;ted
made the &s;eventh hundred; without the lea&s;t account
for what purpo&s;e it was given.</P>
<P>Camilla now heartily repented being a partner in a
bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o rapacious, &s;o unju&s;tifiable, and &s;o my&s;teri|ous;
but, kindly interrupting her apology, &startq;Don't
be concerned, my dear,&endq; he cried, &startq;for there's no
help for the&s;e things; though what the young boys
do with all their money now a-days, is odd enough,
being what I can't make out. However, he'll &s;oon be
wi&s;er &s;o we mu&s;t not be too &s;evere with him; though
I told him, the la&s;t time, I had rather he would not
a&s;k me &s;o often; which was being almo&s;t too &s;harp,
I'm afraid, con&s;idering his youngne&s;s; for one can't ex|pect
him to be an old man at once.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla gave voluntarily her word no &s;uch applica|tion
&s;hould find her its amba&s;&s;adre&s;s again: and
though he would have di&s;pen&s;ed with the promi&s;e, &s;he
made it the more readily as a guard again&s;t her own
facility.</P>
<P>&startq;At lea&s;t,&endq; cried the baronet, &startq;&s;ay nothing to my
poor brother, and more e&s;pecially to your mother; it
being but vexatious to &s;uch good parents to hear of
&s;uch idlene&s;s, not knowing what to think of it; for it
is a great &s;ecret, he &s;ays, what he does with it all; for
which rea&s;on one can't expect him to tell it. My poor
brother, to be &s;ure, had rather he &s;hould be &s;tudying
<HI>hic, haec, hoc;</HI> but, Lord help him! I believe he knows
no more of that than I do my&s;elf; and I never could
m$ke out much meaning of it, any further than it's be|ing
Latin; though I &s;uppo&s;e, at the time, Dr. Orkborne
might explain it to me, taking it for granted he did
what was right&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla was mo&s;t willing to agree to concealing from
her parents what &s;he knew mu&s;t &s;o painfully afflict them,
though &s;he determined to a&s;&s;ume &s;ufficient courage to
expo&s;tulate mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly with her brother, again&s;t whom
&s;he felt &s;en&s;ations of the mo&s;t painful anger.</P>
<P>Again &s;he now took leave; but upon re-entering the
parlour, found Edgar there alone.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="85">
Involuntarily &s;he was retiring; but the coun&s;el of her
father recurring to her, &s;he compelled her&s;elf to advance,
and &s;ay. &startq;How good you have been to Eugenia! how
greatly are we all indebted for your kind vigilance and
exertion!&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar, who was reading, and know not &s;he was in
the hou&s;e, was &s;urpri&s;ed, both by her &s;ight and her ad|dre&s;s,
out of all his re&s;olutions; and, with a &s;oftne&s;s of
voice he meant evermore to deny him&s;elf, an&s;wered,
&startq;To me? can any of the Tyrold family talk of being
indebted to me?&mdash;my own obligations to all, to every
individual of that name, have been the pride, have been
&mdash;hitherto&mdash;the happine&s;s of my life!&mdash;'</P>
<P>The word &startq;hitherto,&punc; which had e&s;caped, affected
him: he &s;topt, recollected him&s;elf, and pre&s;ently, more
drily added &startq;Tho&s;e obligations would be &s;till much in|crea&s;ed,
if I might flatter my&s;elf that one of that race,
to whom I have ventured to play the officious part of a
brother, could forget tho&s;e lectures, &s;he can el&s;e, I fear,
with difficulty pardon.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You have found me unworthy your coun&s;el,&endq; an|&s;wered
Camilla, gravely, and looking down; &startq;you have
therefore concluded I re&s;ent it: but we are not always
completely wrong, even when wide from being right. I
have not been culpable of quite &s;o much folly as not to
feel what I have owed to your good offices; nor am I
now guilty of the inju&s;tice to blame their being with|drawn.
You do &s;urely what is wi&s;e&s;t, though not&mdash;
perhaps&mdash;what is kinde&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>To the&s;e la&s;t words &s;he forced a &s;mile; and, wi&s;hing
him good morning, hurried away.</P>
<P>Amazed pa&s;t expre&s;&s;ion, and touched to the &s;oul, he
remained, a few in&s;tants, immoveable; then, re&s;olving
to follow her, and almo&s;t re&s;olving to throw him&s;elf at
her feet he opened the door &s;he had &s;hut after her: he
&s;aw her &s;till in the hall, but &s;he was in the arms of her
father and &s;i&s;ters, who had all de&s;cended, upon hearing
&s;he had left Sir Hugh, and of whom &s;he was now taking
leave.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="86">
Upon his appearance, &s;he &s;aid &s;he could no longer
keep the carriage; but, as &s;he ha&s;tened from the hall,
he &s;aw that her eyes were &s;wimming in tears.</P>
<P>Her father &s;aw it too, with le&s;s &s;urpri&s;e&punc; but more
pain. He knew her &s;hort and voluntary ab&s;ence from
her friends could not excite them: his heart ached with
paternal concern for her; and, motioning every body
el&s;e to remain in the hall, he walked with her to the car|riage
him&s;elf, &s;aying, in a low voice, as he put her in,
&startq;Be of better courage, my deare&s;t child. Endeavour
to take plea&s;ure where you are going&mdash;and to forget
what you are leaving: and, if you wi&s;h to feel or to give
contentment upon earth, remember always, you mu&s;t
&s;eek to make circum&s;tance contribute to happine&s;s, not
happine&s;s &s;ub&s;ervient to circum&s;tance.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, bathing his hand with her tears, promi&s;ed
this maxim &s;hould never quit her mind till they met
again.</P>
<P>She then drove off.</P>
<P>&startq;Yes,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;I mu&s;t indeed &s;tudy it; Edgar
cares no more what becomes of me! re&s;entment next
to antipathy has taken place of his friend&s;hip and e&s;|teem!&endq;</P>
<P>She wrote down in her pocket-book the la&s;t words of
her father; &s;he re&s;olved to read them daily, and to make
them the current le&s;&s;on of her future and di&s;appointed
life.</P>
<P>Lionel, too impatient to wait for the afternoon, was
already at the grove, and handed her from the chai&s;e.
But &s;topping her in the portico, &startq;Well,&endq; he cried,
&startq;where's my draft?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Before I give it you,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, &s;eriou&s;ly, and walk|ing
from the &s;ervants, &startq;I mu&s;t entreat to &s;peak a few
words to you.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You have really got it, then?&endq; cried he, in a rap|ture;
&startq;you are a charming girl! the mo&s;t charming girl
I know in the world! I won't take your poor twenty
pounds: I would not touch it for the world But come,
where's the draft? Is it for the two or the three?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="87">
&startq;For the two; and &s;urely, my dear Lionel&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;For the two? O, plague take it!&mdash;only for the
two?&mdash;And when will you get me the odd third?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O brother! O Lionel! what a que&s;tion! Will you
make me repent, in&s;tead of rejoice, in the plea&s;ure I
have to a&s;&s;i&s;t you?</P>
<P>&startq;Why, when he was about it, why could he not as
well come down like a gentleman at once? I am &s;ure I
always behaved very had &s;omely to him.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;How do you mean?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, I never frightened him; never put him be|&s;ide
his poor wits, like t'other poor nuncle. I don't
remember I ever did him an ill turn in my life, except
wanting Dr. Pothook, there&punc; to &s;log him a little for not
learning his book. It would have been a rare &s;ight if
he had!&mdash;don't you think &s;o?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Rare, indeed, I hope!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, now, what could he have done, if the Doc|tor
had really performed it? He could not in ju&s;tice
have found fault, when he put him&s;elf to &s;chool to him.
But he'd have felt a little queer. Don't you think he
would?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You only want to make me laugh&punc; to prevent my
&s;peaking to the purpo&s;e; but I am not di&s;po&s;ed to laugh;
and therefore&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, if you are not di&s;po&s;ed to laugh, you are no
company for me. Give me my draft, therefore.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If you will not hear, I hope, at lea&s;t, Lionel, you
will think; and that may be much more efficacious.
Shall I put up the twenty? I really do not want it. And
it is all, all, all I can ever procure you! Remember
that!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What?&mdash;all?&mdash;this all?&mdash;what, not even the other
little mean hundred?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, my dear brother! I have promi&s;ed my uncle
no further application&mdash;&endq;</P>

a promi&s;e from you!&endq;</P>

<P>Mrs. Arlbery now approaching, he ha&s;tily took the
draft&punc; and, after a little he&s;itation, the twenty pounds,
telling her, if &s;he would not a&s;k for him, &s;he mu&s;t a&s;k
for her&s;elf, and that he felt no compunction, as he was
certain &s;he might draw upon her uncle for every guinea

and rode off.</P>
<P>Camilla felt no concern at the lo&s;s of her twenty
pounds: lowered and unhappy, &s;he was rather glad than
&s;orry that her means for being abroad were dimini&s;hed,
and that to keep her own room would &s;oon be mo&s;t con|venient.</P>
<P>The next day was fixed for the journey.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="12" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Walk by Moonlight.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. ARLBERY and Camilla &s;et off in the coach
of Mr. Dennel, widower of a decea&s;ed &s;i&s;ter of the hu&s;|band
of Mrs. Arlbery, whom &s;he was induced to admit
<PB N="88" REF="89">
of the party that he might aid in bearing the expences,
as &s;he could not, from &s;ome family con&s;iderations, re|fu&s;e
taking her niece into her coterie. Sir Sedley Cla|rendel
drove his own phaeton; but, in&s;tead of joining
them, according to the condition which occa&s;ioned the
treaty, cantered away his ponies from the very fir&s;t &s;tage,
and left word, where he changed hor&s;es, that he &s;hould
proceed to the hotel upon the Pantiles.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery was nearly provoked to return to the
Grove. With Mr Dennel &s;he did not think it worth
while to conver&s;e; her niec&punc; &s;he regarded as almo&s;t an
idiot; and Camilla was &s;o &s;piritle&s;s, that, had not Sir
Sedley acceded to her plan, this $as the la&s;t period in
which &s;he would have cho&s;en her for a companion.</P>
<P>They travelled very quietly to within a few miles of
Tunbridge, when an accident happened to one of the
wheels of the carriage that the coachman &s;aid would
take &s;ome hours to repair. They were drawn on, with
difficulty, to a &s;mall inn upon the road, whence they
were obliged to &s;end a man and hor&s;e to Tunbridge for
chai&s;es.</P>
<P>As they were de&s;tined, now, to &s;pend &s;ome time in
this place, Mrs. Arlbery retired to write letters, and Mr.
Dennel to read new&s;papers; and, invited by a bright
moon, Camilla and Mi&s;s Dennel wandered from a little
garden to an adjoining meadow, which conducted them
to a lane, rendered &s;o beautiful by the the &s;trong ma&s;&s;es
of &s;hade with which the trees intercepted the re&s;plen|dent
whitene&s;s of the moon, that they walked on, catch|ing
fre&s;h openings with fre&s;h plea&s;ure, till the feet of
Mi&s;s Dennel grew as weary with the length of the way,
unbroken by any company as the ears of Camilla with
her ince&s;&s;ant prattling, unaided by any idea. Mi&s;s Den|nel
propo&s;ed to &s;it down, and, while relieving her&s;elf by
a fit of yawning and &s;tretching, Camilla &s;trolled a little
further in &s;earch of a &s;afe and dry &s;pot.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Dennel, following in a moment, on tip-toe, and
trembling, whi&s;pered that &s;he was &s;ure &s;he heard a voice.
Camilla, with a &s;mile, a&s;ked if only them&s;elves were pri|vileged
to enjoy &s;o &s;weet a night? &startq;Hu&s;h!&endq; cried &s;he,
&startq;hu&s;h! I hear it again!&endq; They li&s;tened; and, in a
<PB N="89" REF="90">
minute, a &s;oft plaintive tone reached their ears, too di&s;|tant
to be articulate, but undoubtedly female.</P>
<P>&startq;I dare &s;ay it's a robber!&endq; exclaimed Mi&s;s Dennel
&s;haking; &startq;If you don't run back, I &s;hall die!&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla a&s;&s;ured her, from the gentlene&s;s of the &s;ound,
&s;he mu&s;t be mi&s;taken; and pre&s;&s;ed her to advance a few
&s;teps further, in ca&s;e it &s;hould be any body ill.</P>
<P>&startq;But you know,&endq; &s;aid Mi&s;s Dennel, &s;peaking low,
&startq;people &s;ay that &s;ometimes there are noi&s;es in the air,
without its being any body? Suppo&s;e it &s;hould be that?</P>
<P>Still, though almo&s;t imperceptibly, Camilla drew her
on, till, again li&s;tening, they di&s;tinctly heard the words,</P>
<P>&startq;My lovely friend&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;La! how pretty!&endq; &s;aid Mi&s;s Dennel; &startq;let's go a
little nearer.&endq;</P>
<P>They advanced, and pre&s;ently, again &s;topping, heard,
&startq;Could pity pour balm into my woes, how &s;weetly
would they be alleviated by your$s my lovely friend?</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Dennel now looked enchanted, and eagerly led
the way her&s;elf.</P>
<P>In a few minutes, arriving at the end of the lan$,
which opened upon a wild and romantic common, they
caught a glimp&s;e of a figure in white.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Dennel turned pale. &startq;Dear!&endq; cried &s;he, in
the lowe&s;t whi&s;per, &startq;what is it?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;A lady,&endq; an&s;wered Camilla, equally cautious not to
be heard, though totally without alarm.</P>
<P>&startq;Are you &s;ure of that?&endq; &s;aid Mi&s;s Dennel, &s;hrink|ing
back, and pulling her companion to accompany her.</P>
<P>&startq;Do you think it's a gho&s;t?&endq; cried Camilla, unre|&s;i&s;ting
the retreat, yet walking backwards to keep the
form in &s;ight.</P>
<P>&startq;Fie! how can you talk &s;o &s;hocking? all in the dark
&s;o, except only for the moon?</P>
<P>&startq;Your's, my lovely friend!&endq; was now again pro|nounced
in the tendere&s;t accent.</P>
<P>&startq;She's talking to her&s;elf?&endq; exclaimed Mi&s;s Dennel;
&startq;Lord, how frightful!&endq; and &s;he clung clo&s;e to Camilla,
who, mounting a little hillock of &s;tones, pre&s;ently per|ceived
that the lady was reading a letter.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="91">
&startq;Mi&s;s Dennel, tranquili&s;ed by hearing this, was
again content to &s;top, when their ears were &s;uddenly
&s;truck by a piercing &s;hriek.</P>
<P>&startq;O Lord! we &s;hall be murdered!&endq; cried &s;he, &s;cream|ing
&s;till louder her&s;elf.</P>
<P>They both ran back &s;ome paces down the lane, Ca|milla
determining to &s;end &s;omebody from the inn to in|quire
what all this meant: but pre&s;ently, through an
opening to the common&punc; they perceived the form in
white $arting forwards&punc; with an air wild and terrified.
Camilla &s;topt&punc; &s;truck with compa&s;&s;ion and curio&s;ity at
once; Mi&s;s Dennel could not quit her, but after the fir&s;t
glance, hid h$$ face, fai$$ly articulating, &startq;O, don't let
it &s;ee us! don't let it &s;ee us! I am &s;$re it's nothing na|tural!
I dare &s;ay it's &s;omebody walking!</P>
<P>The next in&s;tant&punc; they perceived a man, looking ear|ne&s;tly
around&punc; as if to di&s;cover who had echoed the
&s;cream; the place they occupied was in the &s;hade, and
he did not ob&s;erve them. He &s;oon ru&s;hed ha&s;tily on,
and &s;eized the white garment of the flying figure, which
appeared, both by its dre&s;s and form, to be an elegant
female. She cla&s;ped her hands in &s;upplication, ca&s;t up
her eyes towards heaven, and again &s;hrieked aloud.</P>
<P>Camilla, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that fine internal power of the
thinking and feeling mind to adopt courage for terror,
where any eminent &s;ervice may be the re&s;ult of imme|diate
exertion, was preparing to &s;pring to her relief;
while Mi&s;s Dennel, in extreme agony holding her, mur|mured
out, &startq;Let's run away! let's run away! &s;he's
going to be murdered!&endq; when they &s;aw the man pro&s;|trate
him&s;elf at the lady's feet, in the humble&s;t &s;ubjec|tion.</P>
<P>Camilla &s;topt her flight; and Mi&s;s Dennel, appea&s;ed,
called out; &startq;La! his kneeling! how pretty it looks!
I dare &s;ay it's a lover. How I wi&s;h one could hear
what he &s;ays!&endq;</P>
<P>An exclamation, however, from the lady, uttered in
a tone of mingled affright and di&s;gu&s;t, of &startq;leave me!
leave me!&endq; was again the &s;ignal to Mi&s;s Dennel of re|treat,
but of Camilla to advance.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="92">
The ru&s;tling of the leaves, cau&s;ed by her attempt to
make way through the breach, caught the ears of the
&s;uppliant who ha&s;tily aro&s;e; while the lady folded her
arms acro&s;s her brea&s;t, and &s;eemed ejaculating the mo&s;t
fervent thanks for this relief.</P>
<P>Camilla now forced a pa&s;&s;age through the hedge, and
the lady, as &s;he &s;aw her approach, called out, in a voice
the mo&s;t touching, &startq;Surely 'tis &s;ome pitying Angel,
mercifully come to my re&s;cue!&endq;</P>
<P>The pur&s;uer drew back and Camilla, in the gentle&s;t
words, be&s;ought the la$y to accompany her to the
friends &s;he had ju&s;t left, who would be happy to protect
her.</P>
<P>She gratefully accepted the propo&s;$$l, and Camilla
then ventured to look round&punc; to &s;ee if the object of this
alarm had retreated: but, with an a&s;toni&s;hment that al|mo&s;t
confounded her, &s;he perceived him&punc; a few yards
off, taking a pinch of &s;nuff&punc; and humming an opera air.</P>
<P>The lady, then, &s;natching up her letter, which had
fallen to the ground touched it with her lips, and care|fully
folding, put it into her bo&s;om tenderly ejaculating,
&startq;I have pre&s;erved thee!&mdash;O from what danger! what
violation!&endq;</P>
<P>Then pre&s;&s;ing the hand of Camilla, &startq;You have &s;av|ed
me,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;from the calamity of lo&s;ing what is
more dear than I have words to expre&s;s! Take me but
where I may be &s;hielded from that wretch, and what
&s;hall I not owe to you?&endq;</P>
<P>The moon now &s;hining full upon her face, Camilla
&s;aw &s;eated on it youth, &s;en&s;ibility, and beauty. Her
plea&s;ure, involuntarily rather than rationally, was re|doubled
that &s;he had proved &s;erviceable to her as&punc; in
equal proportion&punc; was her abhorrence of the man who
had cau&s;ed the di&s;turbance.</P>
<P>The three females were now proceeding, when the
offender, with a carele&s;s air, and yet more carele&s;s bow,
advancing towards them, negligently &s;aid, &startq;Shall I
have the honour to &s;ee you &s;afe home, ladies?&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla felt indignant; Mi&s;s Dennel again &s;creamed;
and the &s;tranger, with a look of horror and di&s;gu&s;t,
&s;aid; &startq;Per&s;ecute me no more!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="93">
&startq;O hang it! O cur&s;e it!&endq; cried he, &s;winging his
cane to and fro, &startq;don't be &s;erious. I only meant to
frighten you about the letter.&endq;</P>
<P>The lady deigned no an&s;wer, but murmured to her|&s;elf
&startq;that letter is more precious to me than life or
light!&endq;</P>
<P>They now walked on; and, when they entered the
lane, they had the plea&s;ure to ob&s;erve they were not
pur&s;ued. She then &s;aid to Camilla, &startq;You mu&s;t be &s;ur|pri&s;ed
to &s;ee any one out, and unprotected, at this late
hour; but I had employed my&s;elf, unthinkingly, in
reading &s;ome letters from a dear and ab&s;ent friend, and
forgot the quick pa&s;&s;age of time.&endq;</P>
<P>A man in a livery now appearing at &s;ome di&s;tance,
&s;he ha&s;tily &s;ummoned him, and demanded where was
the carriage?</P>
<P>In the $oad, he an&s;wered, where &s;he had left it, at
the end of the la$e.</P>
<P>She then took the hand of Camilla, and with a &s;mile
of the utmo&s;t &s;oftne&s;s &s;aid, &startq;When the &s;hock I have
&s;uffered is a little over, I mu&s;t &s;urely cea&s;e to lament I
have &s;u&s;tained it, &s;ince it has brought to me &s;uch &s;weet
&s;uccour. Where may I find you to-morrow, to repeat
my thanks?</P>
<P>Camilla an&s;wered, &startq;&s;he was going to Tunbridge im|mediately,
but knew not yet where &s;he &s;hould lodge.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Tunbridge!&endq; &s;he repeated; I am there my&s;elf; I
&s;hall ea&s;ily find you out to-morrow morning, for I &s;hall
know no re&s;t till I have &s;een you again.&endq;</P>
<P>She then a&s;ked her name, and, with the mo&s;t touch|ing
acknowledgments took leave.</P>
<P>Camilla recounted her adventure to Mrs. Arlbery,
with an animated de&s;cription of the fair Incognita, and
with the mo&s;t heart-felt delight of having, though but ac|cidentally,
proved of &s;ervice to her. Mrs. Arlbery
laughed heartily at the recital, a&s;&s;uring her &s;he doubted
not but &s;he had made acquaintance with &s;ome dangerous
fair one, who was playing upon her inexperience, and ut|terly
unfit to be known to her. Camilla warmly vindi|cated
her innocence, from the whole of her appearance,
as well as from the impo&s;&s;ibility of her knowing that her
<PB N="93" REF="94">
&s;cream could be heard: yet was perplexed how to ac|count
for her not naming her&s;elf, and for the my&s;tery of
the carriage and &s;ervant in waiting &s;o far off The&s;e
latter &s;he concluded to belong to her father, as &s;he
looked too young to have any &s;ort of e&s;tabli&s;hment of
her own.</P>
<P>&startq;What I don't under&s;tand in the matter is, that
there reading of letters by the light of the moon;&endq; &s;aid
Mr. Dennel. &startq;Where's the nece&s;&s;ity of doing that,
for a per&s;on that can afford to keep her own coach and
&s;ervants?</P>
<P>Mr. Dennel was a man as unfavoured by nature as he
was uncultivated by art. He had been accepted as a
hu&s;band by the &s;i&s;ter of Mr. Arlbery, merely on ac|count
of a large fortune, which he had acquired in bu|&s;ine&s;s.
The marriage, like mo&s;t others made upon &s;uch
terms, was as little happy in its progre&s;&s;ion as honour|able
in its commencement; and Mi&s;s Dennel, born and
educated amid&s;t dome&s;tic di&s;&s;ention, which robbed her
of all will of her own, by the con&s;tant denial of one
parent to what was accorded by the other, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed too
little reflexion to benefit by ob&s;erving the mi&s;ery of an
alliance not mentally a&s;&s;orted; and grew up with no
other de&s;ire but to enter the &s;tate her&s;elf, from an ardent
impatience to &s;hake off the &s;lavery &s;he experienced in
&s;inglene&s;s. The recent death of her mother had given
her, indeed, &s;omewhat more liberty; but &s;he had not
&s;ufficient &s;en&s;e to endure any re&s;traint, and langui&s;hed
for the complete power which &s;he imagined a hou&s;e and
&s;ervants of her own would afford.</P>
<P>When they arrived at the hotel, in Tunbridge, Mrs.
Arlbery heard, with &s;ome indignation, that Sir Sedley
Clarendel was gone to the rooms, without demon&s;tra|ting,
by any &s;ort of inquiry, the &s;malle&s;t &s;olicitude at her
non-appearance.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Pantiles.</HEAD>
<P>A SERVANT tapt early at the door of Camilla,
the next morning, to acquaint her that a lady, who call|ed
her&s;elf the per&s;on that had been &s;o much obliged to
her the preceding day, begged the honour of being ad|mitted</P>
<P>Camilla was &s;orry, after the &s;u&s;picions of Mrs. Arl|bery,
that &s;he did not &s;end up her name; yet, already
partially di&s;po&s;ed, her prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was not likely to be
de&s;troyed by the figure that now appeared.</P>
<P>A beautiful young creature, with an air of the mo&s;t
attractive &s;oftne&s;s, eyes of the mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive loveline&s;s,
and a manner which by every look and every motion an|nounced
a &s;oul &startq;tremblingly alive,&endq; glided gently into
the room, and advancing, with a graceful confidence of
kindne&s;s, took both her hands, and pre&s;&s;ing them to her
heart, &s;aid, &startq;What happine&s;s &s;o &s;oon to have found you!
to be able to pour forth all the gratitude I owe you, and
the e&s;teem with which I am already in&s;pired!&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla was &s;truck with admiration and plea&s;ure;
and gave way to the mo&s;t lively delight at the fortunate
accident which occa&s;ioned her walking out in a place
entirely unknown to her; declaring &s;he &s;hould ever look
back to that event as to one of the marked ble&s;&s;ings of
her life.</P>
<P>&startq;If you,&endq; an&s;wered the fair &s;tranger, &startq;have the
benevolence thus to value our meeting, how &s;hould it
be appreciated by one who is &s;o eternally indebted to
it? I had not perceived the approach of that per&s;on.
He broke in upon me when lea&s;t a creature &s;o unge|nial
was pre&s;ent to my thoughts. I was reading a let|ter
from the mo&s;t amiable of friends, the mo&s;t refined&mdash;
perhaps&mdash;of human beings!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="96">
Camilla, impatient for &s;ome explanation, an&s;wered,
&startq;I hope, at lea&s;t, that friend will be &s;pared hearing
of your alarm?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I hope &s;o! for his own griefs already overwhelm
him. Never may it be my &s;ad lot to wound where I
mean only to con&s;ole.&endq;</P>
<P>At the words <HI>his own,</HI> Camilla felt her&s;elf blu&s;h.
She had imagined it was &s;ome female friend. She
now found her mi&s;take, and knew not what to imagine
next.</P>
<P>&startq;I had retired,&endq; &s;he continued, &startq;from the glare of
company, and the weight of unintere&s;ting conver&s;ation,
to read, at lei&s;ure and in &s;olitude this dear letter&mdash;
heart-breaking from its own woes, heart-&s;oothing to
mine! In a place &s;uch as this, &s;eclu&s;ion is difficult.
I drove &s;ome miles off, and ordered my carriage to wait
in the high road, while I &s;trolled alone upon the com|mon.
I delight in a &s;olitary ramble by moonlight. I can
then indulge in uninterrupted rumination&punc; and &s;olace
my melancholy by pronouncing aloud &s;uch &s;entences,
and &s;uch names, as in the world I cannot utter. How
exqui&s;itely &s;weet do they &s;ound to ears unaccu&s;tomed
to &s;uch vibrations!&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla was all a&s;toni&s;hment and perplexity. A
male friend &s;o beloved, who &s;eemed to be neither fa|ther,
brother, nor hu&s;band; a carriage at her command,
though without naming one relation to whom either
that or her&s;elf might belong; and &s;entiments &s;o ten|der
&s;he was almo&s;t a&s;hamed to li&s;ten to them; all con|&s;pired
to excite a wonder that painfully prayed for re|lief:
and in the hope to obtain it, with &s;ome he&s;ita|tion,
&s;he &s;aid, &startq;I &s;hould have &s;ought you my&s;elf this
morning, for the plea&s;ure of inquiring after your &s;afety,
but that I was ignorant by what name to make my
&s;earch&endq;</P>
<P>The fair unknown looked down for a moment, with
an air that &s;hewed a perfect con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the inquiry
meant by this &s;peech; but turning a&s;ide the embarra&s;&s;|ment
it &s;eemed to cau&s;e her, &s;he pre&s;ently rai&s;ed her
head, and &s;aid, &startq;I had no difficulty to find you,
<PB N="96" REF="97">
for my &s;ervant, happily, made his inquiry at once at
this hotel.&endq;</P>
<P>Di&s;appointed and &s;urpri&s;ed by this eva&s;ion, Camilla
&s;aw now an evident my&s;tery, but knew not how to pre&s;s
forward any inve&s;tigation. She began, therefore, to
&s;peak of other things, and her fair gue&s;t, who had
every mark of an education rather &s;edulou&s;ly than na|turally
cultivated, joined readily in a conver&s;ation le&s;s
per&s;onal.</P>
<P>They did not &s;peak of Tunbridge, of public places,
nor diver&s;ions; their themes, all cho&s;en by the &s;tranger,
were friend&s;hip, confidence, and &s;en&s;ibility, which &s;he
illu&s;trated and enlivened by quotations from favourite
poets, aptly introduced and feelingly recited; yet al|ways
uttered with a &s;igh, and an air of tender melan|choly.
Camilla was now in a &s;tate &s;o depre&s;&s;ed, that
notwith&s;tanding her native vivacity, &s;he fell as imper|ceptibly
into the plaintive &s;tyle of her new acquaintance,
who &s;eemed habitually pen&s;ive, as if &s;ympathy rather
than accident had brought them together.</P>
<P>Yet when chance led to &s;ome mention of the adven|ture
of the preceding evening, and the lady made again
an animated eulogium of the friend who&s;e letter &s;he was
peru&s;ing; &s;he hazarded, with an half &s;mile, &s;aying:
&startq;I hope&mdash;for his own &s;ake, this friend is &s;ome &s;age and
aged per&s;onage?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O no!&endq; &s;he an&s;wered; &startq;he is in the bloom of
youth.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, again a little di&s;concerted, pau&s;ed; and the
lady went on.</P>
<P>&startq;It was in Wales I fir&s;t met him; upon a &s;pot &s;o
beautiful that painting can never do it ju&s;tice. I have
made, however, a little &s;ketch of it, which, &s;ome day
or other, I will &s;hew you, if you will have the goodne&s;s
to let me &s;ee more of you.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla could not refrain from an eager affirmative;
and the conver&s;ation was then interrupted by a me&s;&s;age
from Mrs. Arlbery, who always breakfa&s;ted in her own
room, to announce that &s;he was going out lodging|hunting.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="98">
Camilla would rather have remained with her new
acquaintance, better adapted to her pre&s;ent turn of mind
than Mrs. Arlbery; but this was impo&s;&s;ible, and the
lovely &s;tranger ha&s;tened away, &s;aying &s;he would call
her&s;elf the next morning to &s;hew the way to her hou&s;e,
where &s;he hoped they might pa&s;s together many &s;ooth|ing
and con&s;olatory hours.</P>
<P>Camilla &s;ound Mrs. Arlbery by no means in her u&s;ual
high &s;pirits. The opening of her Tunbridge campaign
had &s;o far from an&s;wered its trouble and expence, that
&s;he heartily repented having quitted the Grove. The
Officers either were not arrived in the neighbourhood,
or were wholly engaged in military bu&s;ine&s;s; Camilla,
in&s;tead of contributing to the life of the excur&s;ion,
&s;eemed to hang heavily both upon that, and upon her|&s;elf;
and Sir Sedley Clarendel, who&s;e own propo&s;ition
had brought it to bear, had not yet made his appear|ance,
though lodging in the &s;ame hotel.</P>
<P>Thus vexatiou&s;ly di&s;appointed, &s;he was ill-di&s;po&s;ed
to li&s;ten with plea&s;ure to the hi&s;tory Camilla thought
it indi&s;pen&s;able to relate of her recent vi&s;it: and in an|&s;wer
to all prai&s;e of this fair Incognita, only replied
by a&s;king her name and connexions. Camilla felt ex|tremely
fooli&s;h in confe&s;&s;ing &s;he had not yet learnt them.
Mrs. Arlbery, then laughed unmercifully at her com|mendations,
but concluded with &s;aying: &startq;Follow,
however, your own humour; I hate to torment or
be tormented: only take care not to be &s;een with
her.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla rejoiced &s;he did not exact any further re|&s;triction,
and hoped all raillery would &s;oon be &s;et a&s;ide,
by an honourable explanation.</P>
<P>They now repaired to the Pantiles, where the gay
company and gay &s;hops afforded &s;ome amu&s;ement to
Camilla, and to Mi&s;s Dennel a wonder and delight&punc;
that kept her mouth open, and her head jerking from
object to object, &s;o ince&s;&s;antly, that &s;he &s;aw nothing
<PB N="98" REF="99">
di&s;tinctly, from the eagerne&s;s of her fear le&s;t any thing
&s;hould e&s;cape her.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, meeting with an old acquaintance in
the book&s;eller's &s;hop, there &s;at down with him, while
the two young ladies loitered at the window of a toy|&s;hop,
&s;truck with ju&s;t admiration of the beauty and in|genuity
of the Tunbridge ware it pre&s;ented to their
view; till Camilla, in a party of young men who were
&s;trolling down the Pantiles, and who went into the
book&s;eller's &s;hop, di&s;tingui&s;hed the offender of the fair
unknown.</P>
<P>To avoid following, or being recollected by a per|&s;on
&s;o odious to her, &s;he entered the toy-&s;hop with Mi&s;s
Dennel, where &s;he amu&s;ed her&s;elf, till Mrs. Arlbery
came in &s;earch of her, in &s;electing &s;uch various little
articles for purcha&s;e as &s;he imagined would amount to
about half a crown; but which were put up for her at a
guinea. This a little di&s;concerted her: tho' as &s;he was &s;till
unu&s;ually rich, rom Mr. Tyrold's having advanced her
next quarterly allowance, &s;he con&s;oled her&s;elf that they
would &s;erve for little keep-&s;akes for her &s;i&s;ters and her
cou&s;in: yet &s;he determined, when next &s;he entered a
&s;hop for convenience, to put nothing apart as a buyer,
till &s;he had inquired its price.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;aulter, Lord Newford, a young nobleman of
the <HI>ton,</HI> after taking a &s;taring &s;urvey of every thing and
every body around, and &s;eeing no one of more con&s;e|quence,
followed Mrs. Arlbery, with whom formerly
he had been &s;lightly acquainted, to the toy-&s;hop He
a&s;ked her how &s;he did, without touching his hat; and
how long &s;he had been at Tunbridge, without waiting
for an an&s;wer; and &s;aid he was happy to have the plea|&s;ure
of &s;eeing her, without once looking at her.</P>
<P>To his fir&s;t &s;entence, Mrs. Arlbery made a civil an|&s;wer;
but, repenting it upon the two &s;entences that &s;uc|ceeded,
&s;he beard them without &s;eeming to li&s;ten, and
fixing her eyes upon him, when he had done, coolly
&s;aid, &startq;Pray, have you &s;een any thing of my &s;er|vant?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="100">
Lord Newford, &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ed, replied, &startq;No.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Do look for him, then,&endq; cried &s;he, negligently,
&startq;there's a good man.&endq;</P>
<P>Lord Newford, a little piqued, and a little confu&s;ed
at feeling &s;o, &s;aid he &s;hould be proud to obey her; and
turning &s;hort off to his companion, cried &startq;Come, Offy,
why do&s;t loiter? where &s;hall we ride this morning?&endq;
And, taking him by the arm, quitted the Pantiles.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, laughing heartily, now felt her &s;pirits
a little revive; &startq;I doat,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;upon meeting,
now and then, with in&s;olence, I have a little ta&s;te for
it my&s;elf, which I make &s;ome con&s;cience of not indulging
unprovoked.&endq;</P>
<P>They then proceeded to the milliner's, to equip them|&s;elves
for going to the rooms at night. Mrs. Arlbery
and Mi&s;s Dennel, who were both rich, gave large or|ders:
Camilla, indifferent to every thing except to
avoid appearing in a manner that might di&s;grace her
party, told the milliner to choo&s;e for her what &s;he
thought fa&s;hionable that was mo&s;t rea&s;onable. She was
&s;oon &s;itted up with what was too pretty to di&s;approve,
and de&s;iring immediately to pay her bill, found it
amounted to five guineas; though &s;he had imagined &s;he
&s;hould have change out of two.</P>
<P>She had only &s;ix, and &s;ome &s;ilver; but was a&s;hamed
to di&s;pute, or de&s;ire any alteration; &s;he paid the mo|ney;
and only determined to apply to another per&s;on
than the &s;eller, when next &s;he wanted any thing rea|&s;onable.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery now ordered the carriage, and they
drove to Mount Plea&s;ant, where &s;he hired a hou&s;e
for the &s;ea&s;on, to which they were to remove the next
day.</P>
<P>In the evening, they went to the rooms, where the
decidedly fa&s;hionable mien and manner of Mrs. Arl|bery,
attracted more general notice and admiration
than the youthful captivation of Camilla, or the pretty
face and expen&s;ive attire of Mi&s;s Dennel.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="101">
Dre&s;&s;ed by the milliner of the day, Camilla could
not fail to pa&s;s uncen&s;ured, at lea&s;t, with re&s;pect to her
appearance; but her eyes wanted their u&s;ual lu&s;tre,
from the &s;adne&s;s of her heart, and &s;he never looked le&s;s
her&s;elf, nor to le&s;s advantage.</P>
<P>The ma&s;ter of the ceremonies brought to her Sir
Theophilus Jarard; but as &s;he had &s;een him the com|panion
of Lord Newford, to whom &s;he had conceived
a &s;trong aver&s;ion, &s;he declined dancing. He looked
&s;urpri&s;ed, but rather offended than di&s;appointed, and
with a little laught, half contemptuous, as if a&s;hamed
of having offered him&s;elf, &s;talked away.</P>
<P>Sir Sedley Clarendel was now &s;auntering into the
room. Mrs. Arlbery, willing to &s;hew her young friend
in a favourable point of view to him, though more from
pique at his di&s;tance, than from any thought at that
moment of Camilla, told her &s;he mu&s;t po&s;itively accept
Sir Theophilus, who&s;e a&s;king her mu&s;t be regarded as
a particular di&s;tinction, for he was notoriou&s;ly a man of
the <HI>ton.</HI> And, heedle&s;s of her objections, told Mr. Den|nel
to call him back.</P>
<P>&startq;How can I do that,&endq; &s;aid Mr. Dennel, &startq;after &s;ee|ing
her refu&s;e him with my own eyes?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, nobody cares about a man's eyes,&endq; &s;aid Mrs.
Arlbery; &startq;go and tell him Mi&s;s Tyrold has changed
her mind, and choo&s;es to dance.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;As to her changing her mind,&endq; he an&s;wered,
&startq;that's likely enough; but I don't &s;ee how it's any rea|&s;on
I &s;hould go of a fool's errand.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Pho, pho go directly; or you &s;ha'n't dine before
eight o'clock for the whole Tunbridge &s;ea&s;on.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Nay,&endq; &s;aid Mr. Dennel, who had an horror of late
hours, &startq;if you will promi&s;e we &s;hall dine more in rea|&s;on&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, yes,&endq; cried Mrs. Arlbery, hurrying him
off, notwith&s;tanding the reiterated remon&s;trances of
Camilla.</P>
<P>&startq;See, my dear,&endq; &s;he then added, laughing, &startq;how
many weapons you mu&s;t have in u&s;e, if you would go|vern
that &s;trange animal called man! yet never de&s;pair
of victory; for, depend upon it, there is not one of the
<PB N="101" REF="102">
race that, with a little addre&s;s, you may not bring to
your feet.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, who had no wi&s;h but for one &s;ingle votary,
and who&s;e heart was &s;unk from her failure in obtaining
that one, li&s;tened with &s;o little intere&s;t or &s;pirit, that
Mrs. Arlbery, quite provoked, re&s;olved not to throw
away another idea upon her for the re&s;t of the even|ing.
And therefore, as her niece went completely and
con&s;tantly for nothing with her, &s;he &s;poke no more,
till, to her great relief, &s;he was joined by General
Kin&s;ale.</P>
<P>Mr. Dennel returned with an air not more pl$a&s;ed
with his emba&s;&s;y, than her own appeared with her audi|tre&s;s.
The gentleman, he &s;aid, had joined two others,
and they were all laughing &s;o violently together, th$$
he could not find an opportunity to deliver his me&s;|&s;age,
for they &s;eemed as it they would only make a joke
of it.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery then &s;aw that he had got between Lord
Newford and Sir Sedley, and that they were all three
amu&s;ing them&s;elves, without ceremony or di&s;gui&s;e, at
the expence of every creature in the room; up and
down which they &s;trolled, arm in arm, looking fami|liarly
at every body, but &s;peaking to nobody; whi&s;per|ing
one another in hoar&s;e low voices, and then laugh|ing
immoderately loud: while nothing was di&s;tinctly
heard, but, from time to time, &startq;What in the world is
become of Mrs. Berlinton to night?&endq; or el&s;e, &startq;How
&s;tupid the rooms are without lady Alithea?&endq;</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, who, like the re&s;t of the world, &s;aw
her own defects in as glaring colours, and critici&s;ed
them with as much animated ridicule as tho&s;e of her
neighbours, when exhibited by others, no &s;ooner found
&s;he was neglected by this &s;et, than &s;he raved again&s;t the
prevailing ill manners of the leaders in the <HI>ton,</HI> with as
much a&s;perity of cen&s;ure, as if never for a moment be|trayed
her&s;elf, by fa&s;hion, by caprice, nor by vanity,
to &s;imilar foibles. &startq;Yet, after all,&endq; cried &s;he pre&s;ent|ly,
&startq;to &s;ee fools behave like fools, I am well content.
I have no anger, therefore, again&s;t Lord Newford,
nor Sir Theophilus Jarard; if they were not noticed
<PB N="102" REF="103">
for being impertinent, how could they expect to be no|ticed
at all? When there is but one line that can bring
them forward, I rather re&s;pect them that they have
found it out. But what &s;hall we &s;ay to Sir Sedley
Clarendel? A man as much their &s;uperior in capacity
as in powers of plea&s;ing? 'Tis a mi&s;erable thing my
dear General, to &s;ee the dearth of character there is in
the world. Pope has bewailed it in women; believe
me, he might have extended his lamentation. You
may &s;ee, indeed, one man grave, and another gay;
but with no more &startq;mark or likelihood,&endq; no more di&s;|tinction
of colouring, than what &s;imply belongs to a di&s;|mal
face or a merry one: and with ju&s;t as little light and
&s;hade, ju&s;t as abrupt a &s;kip from one to the other, as
&s;eparates inevitably the old man from the young one.
We are almo&s;t all, my good General, of a nature &s;o
pitifully pla&s;tic, that we act from circum&s;tances, and are
fa&s;hioned by &s;ituation.&endq;</P>
<P>Then, laughing at her own pique, &startq;General,&endq; &s;he
added, &startq;&s;hall I make you a confe&s;&s;ion? I am not at
all &s;ure, if that wretched Sir Sedley had behaved as
he ought to have done, and been at my feet all the
evening, that I &s;hould not, at this very moment, be
amu&s;ed in the &s;ame manner that he is him&s;elf! yet it
would be very abominable, I own.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This is candid, however.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, we all acknowledge our faults, now; 'tis the
mode of the day: but the acknowledgment pa&s;&s;es for
current payment; and therefore we never amend them.
On the contrary, they take but deeper root, by lo&s;ing
all chance of concealment. Yet I am vexed to &s;ee that
odious Sir Sedley &s;hew &s;o &s;illy a pa&s;&s;ion for being a man
of the <HI>ton,</HI> as to &s;uffer him&s;elf to be led in a &s;tring by
tho&s;e two poor paltry creatures, who are not more trou|ble&s;ome
as fops, than tire&s;ome as fools, merely becau&s;e
they are better known than him&s;elf upon the turf and at
the clubs.&endq;</P>
<P>Here, &s;he was joined by Lord O'Lerney and the
honourable Mr. Orm&s;by. And, in the next &s;aunter of
the <HI>tonni&s;h</HI> triumvirs, Lord Newford, &s;uddenly &s;eeing
with whom &s;he was a&s;&s;ociated, &s;topt, and looking at
<PB N="103" REF="104">
her with an air of &s;urpri&s;e, exclaimed, &startq;God ble&s;s
me! Mrs. Arlbery! I hope you are perfectly well?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Infinitely indebted to your lord&s;hip's &s;olicitude!&endq;
&s;he an&s;wered, rather &s;arca&s;tically. But, without no|ticing
her manner, he de&s;ired to be one in her tea-party,
which &s;he was then ri&s;ing to form.</P>
<P>She accepted the offer, with a glance of con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
at the General, who, as he conducted her, &s;aid: &startq;I
did not expect &s;o much grace would &s;o immediately
have been accorded.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Alas! my dear General, what can one do? The&s;e
<HI>tonni&s;h</HI> people, cordially as I de&s;pi&s;e them, lead the
world; and if one has not a few of them in one's train,
'twere as well turn hermit. However, mark how
he will fare with me! But don't judge from the open|ing.&endq;</P>
<P>She now made his lord&s;hip &s;o many gay compliments,
and mingled &s;o much per&s;onal civility with the general
entertainment of her di&s;cour&s;e, that, as &s;oon as they
ro&s;e from tea, he profe&s;&s;ed his intention of &s;itting by her,
for the re&s;t of the evening.</P>
<P>She immediately declared her&s;elf tired to death of the
rooms, and calling upon Mi&s;s Dennel and Camilla,
abruptly made her exit.</P>
<P>The General, again her conductor, a&s;ked how &s;he
could leave thus a conque&s;t &s;o newly made.</P>
<P>&startq;I leave,&endq; &s;he an&s;wered, &startq;only to &s;ecure it. He
will be piqued that I &s;hould go, and that pique will keep
me in his head till to-morrow. 'Tis well, my dear
General, to put any thing there! But if I had &s;tayed
a moment longer, my contempt might have broken forth
into &s;atire, or my wearine&s;s into yawning: and I &s;hould
then inevitably have been cut by the <HI>ton</HI> party for the
re&s;t of the &s;ea&s;on.&endq;</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Dennel, who had been dancing, and was again
engaged to dance, remon&s;trated again&s;t retiring &s;o &s;oon;
but Mrs. Arlbery had a regular &s;y&s;tem never to li&s;ten to
her. Camilla, whom nothing had diverted, was con|tent
to retreat.</P>
<P>At the door &s;tood Sir Sedley Clarendel, who, as if
now fir&s;t perceiving them, &s;aid to Mrs. Arlbery, &startq;Ah$$
<PB N="104" REF="105">
my fair friend!&mdash;And how long have you been at the
Wells?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Intolerable wretch!&endq; cried &s;he, taking him apart,
&startq;is it thus you keep your conditions? did you draw me
into bringing this poor love-&s;ick thing with me, only to
&s;igh me into the vapours?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My dear madam!&endq; exclaimed he, in a tone of ex|po&s;tulation,
&startq;who can think of the &s;ame &s;cheme two
days together? Could you po&s;&s;ibly form a notion of any
thing &s;o patriarchal?&endq;</P>
<P>Before they retired to their chambers at the hotel,
Camilla told Mrs. Arlbery how &s;hocking to her was
the &s;ight, much more any acquaintance with Lord New|ford,
who was the per&s;on that had &s;o much terrified
the lady &s;he had met on their journey. Mrs. Arlbery
a&s;&s;ured her he &s;hould be exiled her &s;ociety, if, upon
inve&s;tigation, he was found the aggre&s;&s;or; but while
there appeared &s;o much my&s;tery in the complaint and the
conduct of this unknown lady, &s;he &s;hould po&s;tpone his
bani&s;hment.</P>
<P>Camilla was obliged to &s;ubmit: but &s;carce re&s;ted
till &s;he &s;aw again her new favourite the next morn|ing.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="14" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Mount Ephraim.</HEAD>
<P>THIS expected gue&s;t arrived early. Camilla re|ceived
her with the only &s;en&s;ation of plea&s;ure &s;he had
experienced at Tunbridge. Yet what &s;he excited &s;eem|ed
<PB N="105" REF="106">
&s;till &s;tronger: the fair &s;tranger be&s;ought her friend|&s;hip
as a &s;olace to her exi&s;tence, and hung upon her as
upon a trea&s;ure long lo&s;t, and dearly recovered. Ca|milla
&s;oon caught the infection of her &s;oftne&s;s, and felt
a &s;imilar de&s;ire to cultivate her regard. She found her
beauty attractive, her voice melodious, and her man|ners
bewitchingly care&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>Fearing, neverthele&s;s, while yet in ignorance of her
connections, to provoke further ridicule from Mrs.
Arlbery by going abroad with her, &s;he propo&s;ed defer|ring
to return her vi&s;it till another day: the lady con|&s;ented,
and they &s;pent together two hours, which each
thought had been but two minutes, when Mrs. Arlbery
&s;ummoned Camilla to a walk.</P>
<P>The fair unknown then took leave, &s;aying her &s;er|vant
was in waiting; and Camilla and Mrs. Arlbery
went to the book&s;eller's.</P>
<P>Here, that lady was &s;oon joined by Lord O'Lerney
and General Kin&s;ale, who were warm admirers of her
vivacity and ob&s;ervations. Mr. Dennel took up the
Daily Adverti&s;er; his daughter &s;tationed her&s;elf at the
door to &s;ee the walkers upon the Pantiles; Sir Theo|philus
Jarard, under colour of looking at a popular
pamphlet, was indulging in a nap in a corner; Lord
Newford, noticing nothing, except his own figure as
he pa&s;t a mirror, was &s;huffling loud about the floor,
which was not much embelli&s;hed by the &s;craping of his
boots; and Sir Sedley Clarendel, lounging upon a chair
in the middle of the &s;hop, &s;at eating <HI>bon bons.</HI></P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, for &s;ome time, confined her talents to
general remarks: but finding the&s;e failed to move a
mu&s;cle in the face of Sir Sedley, at whom they were
directed, &s;he &s;uddenly exclaimed: &startq;Pray, my Lord
O'Lerney, do you know any thing of Sir Sedley Cla|rendel?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Not &s;o much,&endq; an&s;wered his Lord&s;hip, &startq;as I could
wi&s;h; but I hope to improve my acquaintance with
him.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why then, my Lord, I am much afraid you will
conclude, when you &s;ee him in one of tho&s;e reveries,
from the total vacancy of his air, that he is thinking
<PB N="106" REF="107">
of nothing. But pray permit me to take his part.
Tho&s;e apparent cogitations, to which he is &s;o much
addicted, are moments only of pretended torpor, but
of real torment, devoted, not as they appear, to &s;upine
in&s;ipidity, but to painful &s;ecret labour how next he may
call him&s;elf into notice. Neverthele&s;s, my Lord, don't
let what I have &s;aid hurt him in your opinion; he is
quaint, to be &s;ure, but there's no harm in him. He
lives in my neighbourhood; and, I a&s;&s;ure your Lord|&s;hip,
he is, upon the whole, what may be called a very
good &s;ort of man.&endq;</P>
<P>Here &s;he yawned violently; and Sir Sedley, unable
to maintain his po&s;ition, twice cro&s;&s;ed his legs, and
then ro&s;e and took a book: while Lord Newford bur&s;t
into &s;o loud a laugh, that he awaked Sir Theophilus Ja|rard,
by echocing, &startq;A good &s;ort of man! O poor Clary!&mdash;O
hang it!&mdash;O cur&s;e it!&mdash;poor C! lary!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What's the matter with Clary?&endq; cried Sir Theophi|lus,
rubbing his eyes; &startq;I have been boring my&s;elf with
this pamphlet, till I hardly know whether I am awake
or a&s;leep.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, he's a good &s;ort of a man!&endq; replied Lord
Newford.</P>
<P>Sir Sedley, though he expected, and even hoped for
&s;ome pointed &s;trictures, and could have defied even
abu&s;e, could not &s;tand this mortifying prai&s;e; and, a&s;k|ing
for the &s;ub&s;cription books, which, already, he had
twice examined, &s;aid: &startq;Is there any body here one
knows?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Oh, ay, have you any names?&endq; cried Lord New|ford,
&s;eizing them fir&s;t; and with &s;ome right, as they
were the only books in the &s;hop he ever read.</P>
<P>&startq;Come, I'll be generous,&endq; &s;aid Mrs. Arlbery, &startq;and
add another &s;ignature again&s;t your Lord&s;hip's next lec|ture.&endq;</P>
<P>She then wrote her name, and threw down half-a-guinea.
Camilla, to whom the book was next pre&s;ent|ed,
concluded this was the e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;tom, and, from
mere timidity, did the &s;ame; though &s;omewhat di&s;|turbed
to leave her&s;elf no more gold than &s;he gave.
Mi&s;s Dennel followed; but her father, who &s;aid he did
<PB N="107" REF="108">
not come to Tunbridge to read, which he could do at
home, po&s;itively refu&s;ed to &s;ub&s;cribe.</P>
<P>Sir Theophilus, now, turning, or rather, to&s;&s;ing over
the leaves, cried: &startq;I &s;ee no name here one knows any
thing of but Lady Alithea Selmore.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, there's body el&s;e here,&endq; &s;aid Lord Newford,
&startq;not a &s;oul!&endq;</P>
<P>Almo&s;t every body pre&s;ent bowed; but wholly indif|ferent
to reproof, he again whi&s;tled, again &s;trolled up
and down the room, and again took a bold and full &s;ur|vey
of him&s;elf in the looking-gla&s;s.</P>
<P>&startq;On the contrary,&endq; cried Sir Sedley, &startq;I hear there
is a mo&s;t extraordinary fine creature lately arrived, who
is invincible to a degree.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O that's Mrs. Berlinton;&endq; &s;aid Sir Theophilus;
&startq;yes, &s;he's a pretty little thing.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;She's very beautiful indeed,&endq; &s;aid Lord O'Ler|ney.</P>
<P>&startq;Where can one &s;ee her?&endq; cried Mrs. Arlbery.</P>
<P>&startq;If &s;he is not at the rooms to-night,&endq; &s;aid Sir Sed|ley,
&startq;I &s;hall be &s;tupified to petrifaction. They tell me
&s;he is a marvel of the fir&s;t water; turning all heads by
her beauty, winning all hearts by her &s;weetne&s;s, fa&s;ci|nating
all attention by her talents, and &s;etting all fa&s;hions
by her elegance.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This paragon,&endq; cried Mrs. Arlbery, to Camilla,
&startq;can be no other than your my&s;terious fair. The de|&s;cription
ju&s;t &s;uits your own.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But my fair my&s;terious,&endq; &s;aid Camilla, &startq;is of a
di&s;po&s;ition the mo&s;t retired, and &s;eems &s;o young, I don't
at all think her married.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This divinity,&endq; &s;aid Sir Sedley, &startq;for the ble&s;&s;ing
of every one, yet
<Q>Lord of Him&s;elf, uncumber'd by a$$ $ife<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Dryden.</NOTE>,</Q>
is &s;afely noo&s;ed; and among&s;t her attributes are two
others cruel to de&s;peration; &s;he excites every hope by
a &s;po&s;o prop$rly dete&s;table&mdash;yet gives birth to de&s;pair,

<P><PB N="108" REF="109">
&startq;And what,&endq; &s;aid Mrs. Arlbery, &startq;is this Lady
Alithea Selmore?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Lady Alithea Selmore?&endq; drily, but with a &s;mile,
an&s;wered General Kin&s;ale.</P>
<P>&startq;Nay, nay, that's not to be mentioned irreverently,&endq;
returned Mrs. Arlbery; &startq;a title goes for a va&s;t deal,&endq;
where there is nothing el&s;e; and, where there is &s;ome|thing,
doubles its value.</P>
<P>Mr. Dennel, &s;aying he found, by the new&s;paper, a
hou&s;e was to be &s;old upon Mount Ephraim, which pro|mi&s;ed
to be a pretty good bargain, propo&s;ed walking thi|ther,
to examine what &s;ort of condition it was in.</P>
<P>Lord O'Lerney inquired if Camilla had yet &s;een
Mount Ephraim. No, &s;he an&s;wered; and a general
party was made for an airing. Sir Sedley ordered his
phaeton; Mrs. Arlbery drove Camilla in her's; Mi&s;s
Dennel walked with her father; and the re&s;t of the gen|tlemen
went on hor&s;eback.</P>
<P>Arrived at Mount Ephraim, they all agreed to alight,
and enjoy the view and pure air of the hill, while Mr.
Dennel vi&s;ited the hou&s;e. But, ju&s;t as Mrs. Arlbery
had de&s;cended from the phaeton, her hor&s;es, taking
fright at &s;ome object that &s;uddenly &s;truck them, reared
up, in a manner alarming to the &s;pectators, and &s;till more
terrific to Camilla, in who&s;e hands Mrs. Arlbery had
left the rein: and the &s;ervant, who &s;tood at the hor&s;es'
heads, received a kick that laid him flat on the ground.</P>
<P>&startq;O, jump out! jump out!&endq; cried Mi&s;s Dennel, &startq;or
el&s;e you'll be murdered!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No! no! keep your &s;eat, and hold the reins!&endq; cried
Mrs. Arlbery: &startq;For heaven's &s;ake, don't jump out!&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, mentally giddy, but per&s;onally courageous,
was &s;ufficiently mi&s;tre&s;s of her&s;elf to obey the la&s;t in|junction,
though with infinite labour, difficulty, and ter|ror,
the hor&s;es plunging and flouncing ince&s;&s;antly.</P>
<P>&startq;Don't you think &s;he'll be killed?&endq; cried Lord New|ford,
di&s;mounting, le&s;t his own hor&s;e &s;hould al&s;o take
fright.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="110">
&startq;Do you think one could help her?&endq; &s;aid Sir Theo|philus
Jarard, &s;teadily holding the bridle of his mare
from the &s;ame apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>Lord O'Lerney was already on foot to afford her a&s;|&s;i&s;tance,
when the hor&s;es, &s;uddenly turning round, gave
to the beholders the dreadful menace of going down the
&s;teep declivity of Mount Ephraim full gallop.</P>
<P>Camilla now, appalled, had no longer power to hold
the reins; &s;he let them go, with an idea of flinging her|&s;elf
out of the carriage, when Sir Sedley, who had dart|ed
like lightning from his phaeton, pre&s;ented him&s;elf at
the hor&s;es' heads, on the moment of their turning, and,
at the vi&s;ible and imminent hazard of his life, happily
&s;topt them while &s;he jumped to th$ ground. They then,
with a fury that pre&s;ently da&s;hed the phaeton to pieces,
plunged down the hill.</P>
<P>The fright of Camilla had not robbed her of her
&s;en&s;es, and the exertion and humanity of Sir Sedley
&s;eemed to re&s;tore to him the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his own:
yet one of his knees was &s;o much hurt, that he &s;unk
upon the gra&s;s.</P>
<P>Penetrated with &s;urpri&s;e, as well as gratitude, Ca|milla,
notwith&s;tanding her own tremor, was the fir&s;t to
make the mo&s;t anxious inquiries: &s;ecretly, however,
&s;ighing to her&s;elf: Ah! had Edgar thus re&s;cued me!
yet &s;truck equally with a &s;en&s;e of obligation and of dan|ger,
from the horrible, if not fatal mi&s;chief &s;he had e&s;|caped,
and from the extraordinary hazard and kindne&s;s
by which &s;he had been &s;aved, &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her concern
and acknowledgments with a &s;oftne&s;s, that even Sir Sed|ley
him&s;elf could not li&s;ten to unmoved.</P>
<P>He received, indeed, from this adventure, almo&s;t
every &s;pecies of plea&s;ure of which his mind was capable.
His natural courage, which he had nearly annihilated,
as well as forgotten, by the effeminate part he was &s;y&s;te|matically
playing, &s;eemed to rejoice in being again ex|erci&s;ed;
his good nature was delighted by the e&s;&s;ential
&s;ervice he had performed; his vanity was gratified by
the publicity of the prai&s;e it brought forth; and his
heart it&s;elf experienced &s;omething like an original feel|ing,
un&s;poilt by the apathy of &s;atiety, from the &s;en&s;i|bility
<PB N="110" REF="111">
he had awakened in the young and lovely Ca|milla.</P>
<P>The party immediately flocked around him, and he
was conveyed to a hou&s;e belonging to Lord O'Lerney,
who re&s;ided upon Mount Ephraim, and his lord&s;hip's
carriage was ordered to take him to his apartment at the
hotel.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, who&s;e high &s;pirits were totally &s;ub|dued
by the terror with which &s;he had been &s;eized at
the danger of Camilla, was &s;o delighted by her re&s;cue,
and the courage with which it was effected, that all her
&s;pleen again&s;t Sir Sedley was changed into the warme&s;t
approbation. When he was put into the coach, &s;he in|&s;i&s;ted
upon &s;eeing him &s;afe to the hotel; Camilla, with
her u&s;ual inartificial quickne&s;s, &s;econding the motion,
and Lord O'Lerney, a nobleman far more di&s;tingui&s;hed
by benevolence and urbanity than by his rank, taking
the fourth place him&s;elf. The &s;ervant, who was con|&s;iderably
hurt, he de&s;ired might remain at his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>In de&s;cending Mount Ephraim, Camilla turned giddy
with the view of what &s;he had e&s;caped, and ca&s;t her
eyes with redoubled thankfulne&s;s upon Sir Sedley as her
pre&s;erver. Fragments of the phaeton were &s;trewed upon
the road; one of the hor&s;es laid dead at the bottom of
the hill; and the other was &s;o much injured as to be to|tally
di&s;abled for future &s;ervice.</P>
<P>When they came to the hotel, they all alighted with
the young baronet, Camilla with as little thought, as
Mrs. Arlbery with little care for doing any thing that
was unu&s;ual. They waited in an adjoining apartment
till they were a&s;&s;ured nothing of any con&s;equence was
the matter, and Lord O'Lerney then carried them to
their new lodging upon Mount Plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery bore her own &s;hare in this accident
with perfect good-humour, &s;aying it would do her in|finite
good, by making her a rigid oeconomi&s;t; for &s;he
could neither live without a phaeton, nor yet build one,
and buy ponies, but by par&s;imonious &s;avings from all
other expences.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="112">
At night they went again to the rooms. But Mrs.
Arlbery found in them as little amu&s;ement as Camilla.
Sir Sedley was not there, either to attack or to flatter;
the celebrated Mrs. Berlinton &s;till appeared not to un|dergo
a &s;crutiny; and Lady Alithea Selmore &s;at at the
upper end of the apartment, attended by all the beaux,
except the General, now at Tunbridge.</P>
<P>This was not to be &s;upported. She aro&s;e, and de|claring
&s;he would take her tea with the invalid, bid the
General e&s;cort her to his room.</P>
<P>In their way out, &s;he perceived the a&s;&s;embly books.
Recollecting &s;he had not &s;ub&s;cribed, &s;he entered her
name, but prote&s;ted &s;he could afford but half-a-guinea,
upon her pre&s;ent new and avaricious plan.</P>
<P>Camilla, with much &s;ecret con&s;ternation, concluded
it impo&s;&s;ible to give le&s;s; and a few &s;hillings were now
all that remained in her pur&s;e. Her unea&s;ine&s;s, how|ever,
pre&s;ently pa&s;&s;ed away, upon recollecting &s;he &s;hould
want no more money, as &s;he was now free of the rooms,
and of the library, and equipped in attire for the whole
time &s;he &s;hould &s;tay.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Dennel put down a guinea; but her father, tel|ling
her half-a-crown would have done, &s;aid, for that
rea&s;on, he &s;hould him&s;elf pay nothing.</P>
<P>Sir Sedley received them with the mo&s;t unaffected
plea&s;ure: forced upon &s;olitude, and by no means free
from pain, he had found no re&s;ource but in reading,
which of late had been his lea&s;t occupation, except the
mere politics of the day. Even reflection had di&s;co|vered
its way to him, though a long bani&s;hed gue&s;t,
which had quitted her po&s;t, to make room for affect|ation,
vanity, and every &s;pecies of frivolity. Reduced,
however, to be rea&s;onable, even by this &s;hort confine|ment,
he now felt the obligation of their charitable vi&s;it,
and &s;et his foppery and conceit apart, from a de&s;ire to
entertain them. Camilla had not conceived he had the
power of being &s;o plea&s;antly natural; and the &s;trong
feeling of gratitude in her ever warm heart made her
<PB N="112" REF="113">
contribute what &s;he was able to the cheerfulne&s;s of the
evening.</P>
<P>Some time after, General Kin&s;ale was called out, and
pre&s;ently returned with Major Cerwood, ju&s;t arrived
from the regiment; who, with &s;ome apology to Sir Sed|ley,
hoped he might be pardoned for the liberty he took,
upon hearing who was at the hotel, of preferring &s;uch &s;o|ciety
to the rooms.</P>
<P>As the Major had nothing in him either brilliant or
offen&s;ive, his &s;ight, after the fir&s;t &s;alutations, was almo&s;t
all of which the company was &s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P>Camilla, his &s;ole object, he could not approach; &s;he
&s;at between the baronet and Mrs. Arlbery; and all her
looks and all her attention were divided between them.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, emerging from the mortifications of ne|glect,
which &s;he had experienced, almo&s;t for the fir&s;t
time in her life, at the rooms, was unu&s;ually alive and
entertaining; Sir Sedley kept pace with her, and the
di&s;cour&s;e was &s;o whim&s;ical, that Camilla, amu&s;ed, and
willing to encourage a &s;en&s;ation &s;o natural to her, after
a &s;adne&s;s till now, for &s;o long a time unremitting, once
more heard and welcomed the &s;ound of her own laugh|ter.</P>
<P>It was in&s;tantly, however, and &s;trangely checked; a
&s;igh, &s;o deep that it might rather be called a groan, made
its way through the wain&s;cot of the next apartment.</P>
<P>Much raillery followed the &s;ight of her changed coun|tenance;
the hotel was pronounced to be haunted, and
by a gho&s;t reduced to that plight from her cruelty. But
the good-humour and gaiety of the conver&s;ation &s;oon
brought her again to its tone; and time pa&s;&s;ed with ge|neral
hilarity, till they ob&s;erved that Mi&s;s Dennel, who,
having no young female to talk with of her own views
and affairs, was thoroughly tired, had fallen fa&s;t a&s;leep
upon her chair.</P>
<P>Her father was already gone home to a hot &s;upper,
which he had ordered in his own room, and meant to
eat before their return; Mrs. Arlbery, to his great di&s;|comfort,
allowing nothing to appear at night but fruit or
oy&s;ters.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="114">
They now took leave, Mrs. Arlbery conducted by the
General, and Camilla by the Major; while Mi&s;s Dennel
una&s;&s;i&s;ted and half a&s;leep, &s;tumbled, &s;creamed, and fell,
ju&s;t before &s;he reached the &s;tairca&s;e.</P>
<P>The General was fir&s;t to aid her; the Major, not
choo&s;ing to quit Camilla; who looking round at a light
which came from the room whence the &s;igh they had
heard had i&s;&s;ued, perceived, as it glared in her eyes, it
was held by Edgar.</P>
<P>A&s;toni&s;hment, plea&s;ure, hope, and &s;hame, took alter|nate
rapid po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her mind; but the la&s;t &s;en&s;ation
was the fir&s;t that vi&s;ibly operated, and &s;he &s;natched her
hand involuntarily from the Major.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery exclaimed, &startq;Ble&s;s me, Mr. Mandle|bert!
are you the gho&s;t we heard &s;ighing in that room
yonder?&endq;</P>
<P>Mandlebert attempted to make &s;ome &s;light an&s;wer;
but his voice refu&s;ed all &s;ound.</P>
<P>She went on, then, to the carriage of Mr. Dennel,
followed by her young ladies, and drove off for Mount
Plea&s;ant.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="15" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Knowle.</HEAD>
<P>THE la&s;t words of Camilla to Mandlebert, in quit|ting
Cleves, and the tears with which he &s;aw her eyes
overflowing, had annihilated all his re&s;entment, and left
him no wi&s;h but to &s;erve her. Her di&s;tinction between
what was wi&s;e&s;t and what was kinde&s;t, had penetrated
him to the quick. To be thought capable of &s;everity
towards &s;o &s;weet a young creature, the daughter of his
guardian, his juvenile companion, and earlie&s;t favourite,
<PB N="114" REF="115">
made him dete&s;table in his own eyes. He langui&s;hed
to follow her, to apologi&s;e for what had hurt her, and
to vow to her a fair and di&s;intere&s;ted friend&s;hip for the
re&s;t of his life: and he only forced him&s;elf, from de|cency,
to &s;tay out his promi&s;ed week with the baronet,
before he &s;et out for Tunbridge.</P>
<P>Upon his arrival, which was late, he went immedi|ately
to the rooms? but he only &s;aw her name in the
books, and learnt, upon inquiring for Mrs. Arlbery,
that &s;he and her party were already retired.</P>
<P>Glad to find her &s;o &s;ober in hours, he went to the
hotel, meaning quietly to read till bed-time, and to call
upon her the next morning.</P>
<P>In a few moments, a voice &s;truck his ear that effec|tually
interrupted his &s;tudies. It was the voice of Ca|milla.
Camilla at an hotel at pa&s;t eleven o'clock! He
knew &s;he did not lodge there; he had &s;een, in the
books, the direction of Mrs. Arlbery at Mount Plea|&s;ant.
Mrs. Arlbery's voice he al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed, Sir
Sedley Clarendel's, General Kin&s;ale's, and, lea&s;t of all
welcome,&mdash;the Major's.</P>
<P>Perhaps, however, &s;ome lady, &s;ome intimate friend
of Mrs. Arlbery, was ju&s;t arrived, and had made them
&s;pend the evening there. He rang for his man, and
bid him inquire who had taken the next room,&mdash;and
learnt it was Sir Sedley Clarendel.</P>
<P>To vi&s;it a young man at an hotel; rich, hand&s;ome,
and &s;plendid; and with a <HI>chaperon</HI> &s;o far from pa&s;t her
prime, &s;o elegant, &s;o coqueti&s;h, &s;o alluring, and &s;till &s;o
pretty; and to meet there a fla&s;hy Officer, her open
pur&s;uer and avowed admirer&mdash;'Tis true, he had con|cluded,
Tunbridge and the Major were one; but not
thus, not with &s;uch glaring impropriety; his love, he
told him&s;elf, was pa&s;t; but his e&s;teem was &s;till &s;u&s;cep|tible,
and now grievou&s;ly wounded.</P>
<P>To read was impo&s;&s;ible. To hold his watch in his
hand, and count the minutes &s;he &s;till &s;taid, was all to
which his faculties were equal. No words di&s;tinctly
reached him; that the conver&s;ation was lively, the tone
of every voice announced, but when that of Camilla
&s;truck him by its laughter, the depth of his concern
<PB N="115" REF="116">
drew from him a &s;igh that was heard into the next
apartment.</P>
<P>Of this, with infinite vexation, he was him&s;elf aware,
from the &s;udden &s;ilence and pau&s;e of all di&s;cour&s;e which
en&s;ued. A&s;hamed both of what he felt and what he be|trayed,
he grew more upon his guard, and hoped it
might never be known to whom the room belonged.</P>
<P>When, however, as they were retiring, a &s;cream
reached his ear, though he knew it was not the voice
Camilla, he could not command him&s;elf, and ru&s;hed
forth with a light; but the lady who &s;creamed was as
little noticed as thought of: the Major was holding the
hand of Camilla, and his eye could take in no more:
he &s;aw not even that Mrs. Arlbery was there; and when
rou&s;ed by her que&s;tion, all voice was denied him for
an&s;wer; he &s;tood motionle&s;s even after they had de|&s;cended
the &s;tairs, till the &s;teps of the General and the
Major, retiring to their chambers, brought to him &s;ome
recollection, and enabled him to retreat.</P>
<P>Fully now, as well as cruelly convinced, of the una|bated
force of his unhappy pa&s;&s;ion, he &s;pent the night in
extreme wretchedne&s;s; and all that was not &s;wallowed
up in repining and regret, was devoted to ruminate upon
what po&s;&s;ible means he could &s;ugge&s;t, to re&s;tore to him|&s;elf
the tranquillity of indifference.</P>
<P>The confu&s;ion of Camilla per&s;uaded him &s;he thought
&s;he was acting wrong; but whether from di&s;approbation
of the character of the Major, or from any pecuniary ob|&s;tacles
to their union, he could not devi&s;e. To a&s;&s;i&s;t the
marriage according to his&punc; former plan, would be&s;t, he
&s;till believed, &s;ooth his internal &s;ufferings, if once he
could fancy the Major at all worthy of &s;uch a wife. But
Camilla, with all her incon&s;i&s;tencies, he thought a trea|&s;ure
unequalled: and to contribute to be&s;tow her on a
man who, probably, only prized her for her beauty, he
now per&s;uaded him&s;elf would rather be culpable than
generous.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, therefore, he could re&s;olve only
upon a complete change of his la&s;t &s;y&s;tem; to &s;eek, in|&s;tead
of avoiding her; to familiari&s;e him&s;elf with her
faults, till he cea&s;ed to doat upon her virtues; to di&s;|cover
<PB N="116" REF="117">
if her difficulties were mental or worldly; to en|force
them if the fir&s;t, and&mdash;whatever it might co&s;t him&mdash;to
invalidate them if the la&s;t.</P>
<P>This plan, the only one he could form, abated his
mi&s;ery. It reconciled him to re&s;iding where Camilla
re&s;ided, it was ea&s;y to him, therefore, to conclude it
the lea&s;t objectionable.</P>
<P>Camilla, meanwhile, in her way to Mount Plea&s;ant,
&s;poke not a &s;yllable. Di&s;may that Edgar &s;hould have
&s;een her &s;o &s;ituated, while in ignorance how it had hap|pened,
made an unea&s;ine&s;s the mo&s;t terrible combat the
perplexed plea&s;ure, that lightened, yet palpitated in
her bo&s;om, from the view of Edgar at Tunbridge, and
from the &s;igh which had reached her ears. Yet, was
it for her he &s;ighed? was it not, rather, from &s;ome &s;e|cret
inquietude, in which &s;he was wholly unintere&s;ted,
and might never know? Still, however, he was at Tun|bridge;
&s;till, therefore, &s;he might hope &s;omething re|lative
to her&s;elf induced his coming; and &s;he determin|ed,
with re&s;pect to her own behaviour, to ob&s;erve the
injunctions of her father, who&s;e letter &s;he would regu|larly
read every morning.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, al&s;o, &s;poke not; the unexpected &s;ight
of Mandlebert occupied all her thoughts; yet, though
his confu&s;ion was &s;u&s;picious, &s;he could not, ultimately,
believe he loved Camilla, as &s;he could &s;ugge&s;t no po&s;&s;ible
impediment to his proclaiming any regard he entertain|ed.
His &s;igh &s;he imagined as likely to be mere la&s;&s;i|tude
as love; and &s;uppo&s;ed, that having long di&s;covered
the partiality of Camilla, his vanity had been confound|ed
by the devoirs of the Major.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Dennel, therefore, was the only one who&s;e
voice was heard during the ride; for now completely
awaked, &s;he talked without ce&s;&s;ation of the fright &s;he
had endured. &startq;La, I thought,&endq; cried &s;he, &startq;when
I tumbled down, &s;omebody threw me down on purpo&s;e,
and was going to kill me! dear me! I thought I &s;hould
have died! And then I thought it was a robber; and
<PB N="117" REF="118">
then I thought that candle that come was a gho&s;t! O
$a! I never was &s;o frightened in my life!&endq;</P>
<P>The next morning they went, as u&s;ual, to the Pan|$iles,
and Mrs. Arlbery took her &s;eat in the book&s;el|lers
&s;hop, where the u&s;ual beaux were encountered;
and where, pre&s;ently, Edgar entering, addre&s;&s;ed to her
&s;ome di&s;cour&s;e, and made &s;ome general inquiries after
the health of Camilla.</P>
<P>It was a cruel drawback to her hopes to &s;ee him fir&s;t
thus in public: but the manner of Mrs. Arlbery at the
hotel, he had thought repul&s;ive; he had ob&s;erved that
&s;he &s;eemed offended with him &s;ince the rencounter at
the breakfa&s;t given for Mi&s;s Dennel; and he now wi&s;h|ed
for &s;ome encouragement for renewing his rights to
the acquaintance.</P>
<P>Sir Sedley, though with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a &s;tick he
had reached the library, was not &s;ufficiently at his ea&s;e to
again mount his hor&s;e; a carriage expedition was there|fore
agitated for the morning, and to &s;ee Knowle being
fixed upon, equipages and hor&s;es were ordered.</P>
<P>While they waited their arrival, Lady Alithea Sel|more,
and a very &s;hewy train of ladies and gentlemen,
came into the library. Sir Sedley, lo&s;ing the ea&s;y, na|tural
manner which had ju&s;t &s;o much plea&s;ed Camilla,
re&s;umed his affectation, indolence, and inattention, and
flung him&s;elf back in his chair, without fini&s;hing a &s;peech
he had begun, or li&s;tening to an inquiry why he &s;topt
&s;hort. His friends, Lord Newford and Sir Theophi|lus
Jarard, &s;huffled up to her lady&s;hip; and Sir Sedley,
muttering to him&s;elf life would not be life without being
introduced to her, got up, and &s;eizing Lord Newford
by the &s;houlder, whi&s;pered what he called the height of
his ambition, and was pre&s;ented without delay.</P>
<P>He then entered into a little abrupt, half articulated
conver&s;ation with Lady Alithea, who, by a certain to&s;s
of the chin, a &s;hort and half &s;cornful laugh, and a &s;u|percilious
dropping of the eye, gave to every &s;entence
&s;he uttered the air of a <HI>bon mot;</HI> and after each, as re|gularly
&s;topt for &s;ome te&s;timony of admiration, as a fa|vourite
<PB N="118" REF="119">
actre&s;s in &s;ome &s;cene in which every &s;peech is ap|plauded.
What &s;he &s;aid, indeed, had no other mark
than what this manner gave to it; for it was neither
good nor bad, wi&s;e nor fooli&s;h, &s;prightly nor dull. It
was what, if naturally &s;poken, would have pa&s;&s;ed, as it
de&s;erved, without $$n&s;ure or prai&s;e&punc; This manner,
however, prevailed not onl$ upon her auditors but her|&s;elf,
to believe that &s;omething of wit, of <HI>fine&s;&s;e,</HI> of pe|culiarity,
accompanied her every ph$a&s;e. Though,
properly &s;peaking, there was none in any thing &s;he pro|nounced:
her &s;peeches were all replies, which her ad|mirers
dignified by the name of repartees, and which
mechanically and regularly flowed from &s;ome word, not
idea, that preceded.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, having li&s;tened &s;ome time, turned en|tirely
away, though with le&s;s contempt of her lady&s;hip
than of her hearers. Her own auditors, however, ex|cept
the faithful General, had all de&s;erted her. Even
the Major, curious to attend to a lady of &s;ome celebrity,
had quitted the chair of Camilla; and Edgar him&s;elf,
imagining, from this univer&s;al devotion, there was &s;ome|thing
well worth an audience, had joined the group.</P>
<P>&startq;We are terribly in the back ground, General!&endq;
cried Mrs. Arlbery, in a low voice. &startq;What mu&s;t be
done to &s;ave our reputations?&endq;</P>
<P>The General, laughing, &s;aid, he feared they were
lo&s;t irretrievably; but added that he preferred defeat
with her, to victory without her.</P>
<P>&startq;Your gallantry, my dear General,&endq; cried &s;he, with
a &s;udden air of glee, &startq;&s;hall be rewarded! Follow me
clo&s;e, and you &s;hall &s;ee the fortune of the day rever|&s;ed.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ri&s;ing then,&endq; &s;he advanced &s;oftly, and with an air
of re&s;pect, towards the party, and fixing her&s;elf ju&s;t op|po&s;ite
to Lady Alithea, with looks of the mo&s;t profound
attention, &s;tood &s;till, as if in admiring expectation.</P>
<P>Lady Alithea, who had regar$ed this approach as an
intru&s;ion that &s;trongly manife&s;ted ignorance of high life,
thought much better of it when &s;he remarked the almo&s;t
veneration of her air. She deemed it, however, wholly
beneath her to &s;peak when thus attended to; till, ob|&s;erving
<PB N="119" REF="120">
the patient admiration with which even a &s;ingle
word &s;eemed to be hoped for, &s;he began to pardon what
appeared to be a mere tribute to her fame; and upon
Sir Theophilus Jarard's &s;aying, &startq;I don't think we
have had &s;uch a bore of a &s;ea&s;on as this, the&s;e five
years;&endq; could not refu&s;e her&s;elf the plea&s;ure of reply|ing:
&startq;I did not imagine, Sir Theophilus, you were
already able to count by lu&s;tres.&endq;</P>
<P>Her own air of complacency announced the happi|ne&s;s
of this an&s;wer&punc; The company, as u&s;ual, took the
hint, and approbation was buzzed around her. Lord
Newford gave a loud laugh, without the lea&s;t concep|tion
why; and Sir Theophilus, after paying the &s;ame
compliment, wi&s;hed, as it concerned him&s;elf, to know
what had been &s;aid; and glided to the other end of the
&s;hop, to look for the word lu&s;tre in Entick's dictionary.</P>
<P>But this triumph was even le&s;s than momentary; Mrs.
Arlbery, gently rai&s;ing her &s;houlders with her head, in|dulged
her&s;elf in a &s;mile that &s;avoured yet more of pity
than deri&s;ion; and, with an ha&s;ty glance at the General,
that &s;poke an eagerne&s;s to compare notes with him, hur|ried
out of the &s;hop; her eyes dropt, as if fearful to
tru&s;t her countenance to an in&s;tant's inve&s;tigation.</P>
<P>Lady Alithea felt her&s;elf blu&s;h. The confu&s;ion was
painful and unu&s;ual to her. She drew her glove off and
on; &s;he d$bbed a highly &s;cented pocket handkerchief
repeatedly to her no&s;e; &s;he wondered what it was
o'clock, took her watch in her hand, without recollect|ing
to examine it; and then wondered if it would rain,
though not a cloud was to be di&s;cerned in the &s;ky.</P>
<P>To &s;ee her thus completely di&s;concerted, gave a
weight to the mi&s;chievous malice of Mrs. Arlbery, of
which the &s;malle&s;t pre&s;ence of mind would have robbed
it. Her admirers, one by one, dwindled away, with
le&s;&s;ened e&s;teem for her talents; and, finding her&s;elf pre|&s;ently
alone in the &s;hop with Sir Theophilus Jarard, &s;he
&s;aid, &startq;Pray, Sir Theophilus, do you know any thing
of that queer woman?&endq;</P>
<P>The words <HI>queer woman</HI> were guides &s;ufficient to Sir
Theophilus, who an&s;wered, &startq;No! I have &s;een her,
<PB N="120" REF="121">
&s;omewhere, by accident, but&mdash;&s;he is quite out of our
line.&endq;</P>
<P>This reply was a &s;en&s;ible gratification to Lady Ali|thea,
who, having heard her warmly admired by Lord
O'Lerney, had been the more &s;u&s;ceptible to her ridi|cule.
Rudene&s;s &s;he could have de&s;pi&s;ed without emo|tion;
but contempt had &s;omething in it of in&s;olence; a
commodity &s;he held her&s;elf born to di&s;pen&s;e, not re|ceive.</P>
<P>When Mrs. Arlbery arrived, laughing, at the bot|tom
of the Pantiles, &s;he found Edgar making inquiries
of the time and manner of drinking the mineral water.</P>
<P>Camilla heard him, al&s;o, and with deep apprehen&s;ions
for his health. He did not however look ill; and a &s;e|cond
&s;adne&s;s, not le&s;s deep, en&s;ued, that &s;he could now
retain no hope of being her&s;elf his inducement to this
journey.</P>
<P>But egoti&s;m was no part of her compo&s;ition; when
&s;he &s;aw, therefore, the next minute, Sir Sedley Cla|rendel
advance limping, and heard him a&s;k if his phea|$on
were ready, &s;he approached him, &s;aying, &startq;Will
you venture, Sir Sedley, in your pheaton?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;There's no &s;ort of rea&s;on why not,&endq; an&s;wered he,
&s;en&s;ibly flattered; &startq;yet I had certainly rather go as
you go!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Then that,&endq; &s;aid Mrs. Arlbery, mu&s;t be in Den|nel's
coach, with him and my little niece here: and
then I'll drive the General in your phaeton&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Agreed!&endq; cried Sir Sedley, &s;eating him&s;elf on
one of the forms; and then, taking from a paper &s;ome
tickets, added; &startq;I want a few guineas&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;So do I!&endq; exclaimed Mrs. Arlbery; &startq;do you
&startq;know where &s;uch &s;ort of things are to be met with?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Lady Alithea Selmore has promi&s;ed to di&s;per&s;e
&s;ome twenty tickets for the ma&s;ter of the ceremonies'
ball, and &s;he commands me to help. How many &s;hall
I give you?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;A&s;k Mr. Dennel,&endq; an&s;wered &s;he negligently;
&startq;he's the only pay-ma&s;ter ju&s;t now.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="122">
Mr. Dennel turned round, and was going to walk
away; but Mrs. Arlbery, taking him by the arm,
&s;aid, &startq;my good friend, how many tickets &s;hall Sir
Sedley give you?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Me! none at all.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O &s;ie! every body goes to the ma&s;ter of the cere|monies'
ball. Come, you &s;hall have &s;ix. You can't
po&s;&s;ibly take le&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Six! What &s;hould I do with them?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why you and your daughter will u&s;e two, and four
you mu&s;t give away.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What for?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Was ever &s;uch a que&s;tion? To do what's proper
and right, and hand&s;ome and gallant.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, as to all that, it's what I don't under&s;tand.
It's out of my way.&endq;</P>
<P>He would then have made off; but Mrs. Arlbery,
piqued to &s;ucceed, held him fa&s;t, and &s;aid: &startq;Come,
if you'll be good, I'll be good too, and you &s;hall have
a plain joint of meat at the bottom of the table every
day for a fortnight.&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Dennel &s;oftened a little here into &s;omething like
a &s;mile; and drew two guineas from his pur&s;e; but
more there was no obtaining.</P>
<P>&startq;Come,&endq; cried Sir Sedley, &startq;you have canva&s;&s;ed
well &s;o far. Now for your fair &s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You are a &s;hocking creature!&endq; cried &s;he; don't
you know I am turned mi&s;er?&endq;</P>
<P>Yet &s;he gave her guinea.</P>
<P>&startq;But the fair Tyrolda does not al&s;o, I tru&s;t, a&s;&s;ume
that character?&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla had felt very unea&s;y during this conte&s;t; and
now, colouring, &s;aid &s;he did not mean to go to the
ball.</P>
<P>&startq;Can you ev$r expect, then,&endq; &s;aid Mrs. Arlbery,
&startq;to have a partner at any other? You don't know the
rules of the&s;e places. The ma&s;ter of the ceremonies
is always a gentleman, and every body is eager to &s;hew
him every po&s;&s;ible re&s;pect.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla was now &s;till more di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; and &s;tam|mered
out, that &s;he believed the fewer balls &s;he went
to, the better her father would be plea&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="123">
&startq;Your father, my dear, is a very wi&s;e man, and a
very good man, and a very excellent preacher: but what
does he know of Tunbridge Wells? Certainly not &s;o
much as my dairy maid, for &s;he has heard John talk of
them; but as to your father, depend upon it, the &s;ole
knowledge he has ever obtained, is from &s;ome treati&s;e
upon its mineral waters; which, very po&s;&s;ibly, he can
analy&s;e as well as a phy&s;ician: but for the regulation
of a country dance, be a&s;&s;ured he will do much better
to make you over to Sir Sedley, or to me.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla laughed faintly, and feeling in her pocket
to take out her pocket handkerchief, by way of &s;ome|thing
to do, Mrs. Arlbery concluded &s;he was &s;eeking
her pur&s;e, and &s;uddenly putting her hand upon her arm
to prevent her, &s;aid, &startq;No, no! if you don't wi&s;h to
go, or choo&s;e to go, or approve of going, I cannot,
in &s;ober earne&s;tne&s;s, &s;ee you compelled. Nothing is &s;o
dete&s;table as forcing people to be amu&s;ed. Come, now
for Knowle.&endq;</P>
<P>Sir Sedley was then putting up his tickets; but the
Major, taking one of them out of his hand, pre&s;ented
it to Camilla, &s;aying: &startq;Let the ladies take their tick|ets,
now, and &s;ettle with us afterwards.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla felt extremely provoked, yet not knowing
how to re&s;i&s;t, took the ticket; but, turning pointedly
from the Major to Sir Sedley, &s;aid: &startq;I am your debt|or,
then, &s;ir, a guinea&mdash;the &s;malle&s;t part, indeed, of
what I owe you, though all I can pay!&endq; And &s;he
then re&s;olved to borrow that &s;um immediately of Mrs.
Arlbery.</P>
<P>Sir Sedley began to think &s;he grew hand&s;omer every
moment: and, contrary to his e&s;tabli&s;hed and &s;y&s;tematic
inattention, upon hearing the &s;ound of the carriages,
conducted her him&s;elf to Mr. Dennel's coach, which
he a&s;cended after her.</P>
<P>Edgar, unable to with&s;tand joining the party, had
ordered his hor&s;e during the deba$e about the tickets.</P>
<P>Lords O'Lerney and Newford, and Sir Theophilus
Jarard, and Major Cerwood, went al&s;o on hor&s;eback.</P>
<P>Sir Sedley made it his &s;tudy to procure amu&s;ement
for Camilla during the ride; and while he humoured
<PB N="123" REF="124">
alternately the loquacious folly of Mi&s;s Dennel, and
the under-bred po&s;itivene&s;s of her father, intermingled
with both comic &s;arca&s;ms again&s;t him&s;elf, and pointed
annotations upon the times, that &s;omewhat diverted her
&s;olicitude and perplexity.</P>
<P>She forgot them however, more naturally, in exa|mining
the noble antique man&s;ion, pictures, and cu|rio&s;ities
of Knowle; and in paying the tribute that
ta&s;te mu&s;t ever pay to the works exhibited there of Sir
Jo&s;hua Reynolds.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e viewed, they all proceeded to the park,
where, enchanted with the noble old trees which ve|nerably
adorn it, they &s;trolled delightedly, till they
came within &s;ight of an elegant white form, as far di&s;|tant
as their eyes could reach, reading under an oak.</P>
<P>Camilla in&s;tantly thought of her moon-light friend;
but Sir Theophilus called out, &startq;Faith, there's the di|vine
Berlinton!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Is there, faith?&endq; exclaimed Lord Newford, &s;ud|denly
ru&s;hing forward to &s;atisfy him&s;elf if it were true.</P>
<P>Deeming this an ill-bred and unauthori&s;ed intru&s;ion,
they all &s;topt. The &s;tudious fair, profoundly ab&s;orbed
by her book, did not hear his lord&s;hip's foot&s;teps, till
his coat ru&s;tled in her ears. Rai&s;ing then her eyes,
&s;he &s;creamed, dropt her book, and darting up, flew to|wards
the wood, with a velocity far exceeding his own,
though without &s;eeming to know, or con&s;ider, whether
her flight might lead her.</P>
<P>Camilla, certain now this was her new friend, felt
an indignation the mo&s;t lively again&s;t Lord New|ford,
and involuntarily &s;prung forward. It was evident
the fair fugitive had perceived none of the party but
him &s;he &s;ought to avoid; notwith&s;tanding Lord New|ford
him&s;elf, when convinced who it was, cea&s;ed his
pur&s;uit, and &s;eemed almo&s;t to find out there was &s;uch
a &s;en&s;ation as &s;hame; though by various antics, of
&s;winging his cane, looking up in the air, &s;haking his
pocket handkerchief, and &s;ticking his arms a-kimbo,
he thought it e&s;&s;ential to his credit to di&s;gui&s;e it.</P>
<P>Camilla had no chance to reach the flying beauty,
but by calling to her to &s;top; which &s;he did in&s;tantly at
<PB N="124" REF="125">
the &s;ound of her voice, and, turning round with a look
of rapture, ran into her arms.</P>
<P>The Major, who&s;e devoirs to Camilla always &s;ought,
not avoided the public eye, eagerly pur&s;ued her. Ed|gar,
cruelly envying a licence he concluded to re&s;ult
from his happy &s;ituation, looked on in &s;ilent amaze;
but li&s;tened with no &s;mall attention to the remarks that
now fell from Mrs. Arlbery, who &s;aid &s;he was &s;ure this
mu&s;t be the fair Incognita that Mi&s;s Tyrold had met
with upon the road; and gave a lively relation of that
adventure.</P>
<P>He could not hear without delight the benevolent
courage thus manife&s;ted by Camilla, nor without terror
the danger to which it might have expo&s;ed her. But
Lord O'Lerney, with an air of extreme &s;urpri&s;e, ex|claimed:
&startq;Is it po&s;&s;ible Lord Newford could give any
cau&s;e of alarm to Mrs. Berlinton?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Is &s;he then, my lord, a woman of character?&endq;
cried Mrs. Arlbery.</P>
<P>&startq;Untainted!&endq; he an&s;wered &s;olemnly; &startq;as &s;pot|le&s;s,
I believe as her beauty: and if you have &s;een
her, you will allow that to be no &s;mall prai&s;e. She
comes from a mo&s;t re&s;pectable family in Wales, and
has been married but a few months:&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Married, my lord? my fair female Quixote a&s;|&s;ured
me &s;he was &s;ingle.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, poor thing! &s;he was carried from the nur&s;ery
to the altar, and, I fear, not very judiciou&s;ly nor hap|pily.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Dear!&endq; cried Mi&s;s Dennel, &startq;i'n't &s;he happy?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I never pre&s;ume to judge,&endq; an&s;wered his lord&s;hip,
&s;miling, &startq;but &s;he has always &s;omething melancholy
in her air.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Pray how old is &s;he?&endq; &s;aid Mi&s;s Dennel.</P>
<P>&startq;Eighteen.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Dear! and married?&mdash;La! I wonder what makes
her unhappy!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Not a hu&s;band, certainly!&endq; &s;aid Mrs. Arlbery,
laughing, &startq;that is again&s;t all chance and probability.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, I'm re&s;olved when I'm married my&s;elf, I
won't be unhappy.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="126">
&startq;And how will you help it?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, becau&s;e I'm determined I won't. I think it's
very hard if I may'nt have my own way when I'm
married.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;'Twill at lea&s;t be very &s;ingular!&endq; an&s;wered Mrs.
Arlbery.</P>
<P>Camilla now returned to her party, having fir&s;t con|ducted
her new friend towards a door in the park
where her carriage was waiting.</P>
<P>&startq;At length, my dear,&endq; &s;aid Arlbery, &startq;your fair
my&s;terious has, I &s;uppo&s;e avowed her&s;elf?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I made no enquiry,&endq; an&s;wered &s;he, painfully look|ing
down.</P>
<P>&startq;I can tell you who &s;he is, then, my&s;elf,&endq; &s;aid Mi&s;s
Dennel; &startq;&s;he is Mrs. Berlinton, and &s;he's come out
of Wales, and &s;he's married, and &s;he's eighteen.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Married!&endq; repeated Camilla, blu&s;hing from inter|nal
&s;urpri&s;e at the conver&s;ations &s;he had held with her.</P>
<P>&startq;Yes; your fair incognita is neither more nor le&s;s,&endq;
&s;aid Mrs. Arlbery, &startq;than the honourable Mrs. Berlin|ton,
wife to Lord Berlinton's brother, and, next only
to Lady Alithea Selmore, the fir&s;t toa&s;t, and the reign|ing
cry of the Wells for this &s;ea&s;on.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, who had &s;een and con&s;idered her in almo&s;t
every other point of view, heard this with le&s;s of
plea&s;ure than a&s;toni&s;hment. When a further inve&s;tiga|tion
brought forth from Lord O'Lerney that her mai|den
name was Melmond, Mrs. Arlbery exclaimed:
&startq;O, then, I cea&s;e to play the idiot, and wonder! I
know the Melmonds well. They are all half crazy,
romantic, love-lorn, &s;tudious, and &s;entimental. One
of them was in Hamp&s;hire this &s;ummer, but &s;o im|men&s;ely
&startq;melancholy and gentleman-like<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Ben John&s;on.</NOTE>,&endq; that I
never took him into my &s;ociety.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;'Twas the brother of this young lady, I doubt not,&endq;
&s;aid Lord O'Lerney; he is a young man of very
good parts, and of an exemplary character; but &s;trong
in his feelings, and wild in pur&s;uit of whatever excites
them.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;When will you introduce me to your new friend,
Mi&s;s Tyrold?&endq; &s;aid Mrs. Arlbery; &startq;or, rather,&endq; (turn|ing
<PB N="126" REF="127">
to Lord Newford,) &startq;I hope your lord&s;hip will do
me that honour; I hear you are very kind to her; and
take much care to convince her of the ill effects and
danger of the evening air.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O hang it! O cur&s;e it!&endq; cried his lord&s;hip; &startq;why
does a woman walk by moon-light?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, rather, &s;hould man,&endq; &s;aid Lord O'Lerney,
&startq;impede &s;o natural a recreation?&endq;</P>
<P>The age of Lord O'Lerney, which more than
doubled that of Lord Newford, made this que&s;tion
&s;upported, and even drew forth the conde&s;cen&s;ion of an
attempted exculpation. &startq;I vow, my lord,&endq; he cried,
&startq;I had no intention but to look at a letter; and that
I thought, &s;he only read in public to excite curio&s;ity.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O but you knelt to her!&endq; cried Mi&s;s Dennel,
&startq;you knelt to her! I &s;aw you! and why did you do
that, when you knew &s;he was married, and you could
not be her lover?&endq;</P>
<P>The party being now di&s;po&s;ed to return to the
Wells, Mrs. Arlbery called upon the General to
attend her to the phaeton. Camilla, impatient to
pay Sir Sedley, followed to &s;peak to her; but, not
aware of her wi&s;h, Mrs. Alberly hurried laughingly
on, &s;aying, &startq;Come, General, let us be gone, that
the coach may be la&s;t, and then Dennel mu&s;t pay the
fees! That will be a good guinea towards my ponies!&endq;</P>

<P>THE &s;hame and di&s;tre&s;s natural to every unhackney|ed

<P>When they arrived at Mount Plea&s;ant, &s;he &s;aw all

with a de&s;ign to hand her out: but as the Major ad|vanced,
he retreated, and, finding him&s;elf unnoticed
by Mrs. Arlbery, remounted his hor&s;e. Provoked and
chagrined, &s;he &s;prung forward alone, and when pur|&s;ued

<P>&startq;Remarked! how? by whom?&endq;</P>
<P>She coloured, and was again hardly pre&s;&s;ed before

my faults&mdash;points them out him&s;elf&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Does he?&endq;&mdash;&s;aid Mrs. Arlbery thoughtfully, and
pau&s;ing: &startq;nay, then,&mdash;if &s;o&mdash;he wi&s;hes to marry
you!&endq;</P>
<P>&punc;Me, ma'am!&endq; cried Camilla, blu&s;hing high with
mingled delight at the idea, and di&s;plea&s;ure at its free
expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>&startq;Why, el&s;e, &s;hould he caution you again&s;t ano|ther?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="129">
&startq;From goodne&s;s, from kindne&s;s, from genero|&s;ity!&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, no; tho&s;e are not the characteri&s;tics of young
men who coun&s;el young women! We all heard he was
engaged to your beautiful vacant-looking cou&s;in; but I
&s;uppo&s;e he grew &s;ick of her. A very young man &s;el|dom
likes a &s;illy wife. It is generally when he is fur|ther
advanced in life that he takes that depraved ta&s;te.
He then flatters him&s;elf a fool will be ea&s;ier to govern.&endq;</P>
<P>She now went away to dre&s;s; leaving Camilla a new
creature; changed in all her hopes, though over|whelmed
with &s;hame at the freedom of this attack,
and determined to exert her utmo&s;t &s;trength of mind,
not to expo&s;e to view the &s;ecret plea&s;ure with which it
filled her.</P>
<P>She was, however, &s;o ab&s;ent when they met again,
that Mrs. Arlbery, &s;haking her head, faid: &startq;Ah,
my fair friend! what have you been thinking of?&endq;</P>
<P>Exce&s;&s;ively a&s;hamed, &s;he endeavoured to brighten
up. The General and Sir Sedley had been invited to
dinner. The latter was engaged in the evening to
Lady Alithea Selmore, who gave tea at her own lodg|ings.
&startq;The rooms, then, will be quite empty,&endq; &s;aid
Mrs. Arlbery; &startq;&s;o we had better go to the play.&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Dennel had no objection, and Sir Sedley pro|mi&s;ed
to attend them, as it would be time enough for
her lady&s;hip afterwards.</P>
<P>So completely was Camilla ab&s;orbed in her new
ideas, that &s;he forgot both her borrowed guinea, and
the &s;tate of her pur&s;e, till &s;he arrived at the theatre.
The recollection was then too late; and &s;he had no re|&s;ource
again&s;t completely emptying it.</P>
<P>She was too happy however, at this in&s;tant, to admit
any regret. The &s;agacity of Mrs. Arlbery &s;he thought
infallible; and the &s;ight of Edgar in a box ju&s;t facing
her, bani&s;hed every other con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>The theatre was almo&s;t without company. The a&s;|&s;embly
at Lady Alithea Selmore's had made it unfa&s;hi|onable,
<PB N="129" REF="130">
and when the play was over, Edgar found ea&s;ily
a place in the box.</P>
<P>Lord Newford and Sir Theophilus Jarard looked in
ju&s;t after, and affected not to know the piece was begun.
Sir Sedley retired to his toilette, and Mr. Dennel to
&s;eek his carriage.</P>
<P>Some bills now got into the box, and were read by
Sir Theophilus, announcing a &s;uperb exhibition of
wild bea&s;ts for the next day, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of mon|kies
who could perform various feats, and a famous
ourang outang, ju&s;t landed from Africa.</P>
<P>Lord Newford &s;aid he would go if he had but two
more days to live. Sir Theophilus echoed him. Mr.
Dennel expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome curio&s;ity; Mi&s;s Dennel, though
&s;he prote&s;ted &s;he &s;hould be frightened out of her wits,
&s;aid &s;he would not &s;tay at home; Mrs. Arlbery con|fe&s;&s;ed
it would be an amu&s;ing &s;ight to &s;ee &s;o many repre|&s;entations
of the dear human race; but Camilla &s;poke
not: and &s;carce heard even the &s;ubject of di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>&startq;You,&endq; cried the Major, addre&s;&s;ing her, &startq;will be
there?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Where?&endq; demanded &s;he.</P>
<P>&startq;To &s;ee this curious collection of animals.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It will be curious, undoubtedly,&endq; &s;aid Edgar,
plea&s;ed that &s;he made no an&s;wer; &startq;but 'tis a &s;pecies
of curio&s;ity not likely to attract the mo&s;t elegant &s;pec|tators;
and rather, perhaps, adapted to give plea&s;ure
to naturali&s;ts, than to young ladies.&endq;</P>
<P>Softened, at this moment, in every feeling of her
heart towards Edgar, &s;he turned to him, and &s;aid,
&startq;Do you think it would be wrong to go?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Wrong&endq; repeated he, &s;urpri&s;ed though gratified,
&startq;is perhaps too hard a word; but, I fear, at an itine|rant
&s;how, &s;uch as this, a young lady would run &s;ome
chance of finding her&s;elf in a neighbourhood that might
&s;eem rather &s;trange to her.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Mo&s;t certainly then,&endq; cried &s;he, with quickne&s;s,
&startq;I will not go!&endq;</P>
<P>The a&s;toni&s;hed Edgar looked at her with earne&s;tne&s;s,
and &s;aw the &s;implicity of &s;incerity on her countenance.
He looked then at the Major; who, accu&s;tomed to
<PB N="130" REF="131">
frequent failures in his &s;olicitations, exhibited no
change of features. Again he looked at Camilla, and
her eyes met his with a &s;weetne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion that pa&s;|&s;ed
&s;traight to his heart.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery now led the way to the coach; the for|wardne&s;s
of the Major, though in her own de&s;pight,
procured him the hand of Camilla; but &s;he had left
upon Edgar an impre&s;&s;ion renovating to all his e&s;teem.
She is &s;till, he thought, the &s;ame; candid, open, flexi|ble;
&s;till, therefore, let me follow, her, with &s;uch
coun&s;el as I am able to give. She has accu&s;ed me of
unkindne&s;s;&mdash;She was right! I retreated from her
&s;ervice at the moment when, in honour, I was bound to
continue in it. How &s;elfi&s;h was &s;uch conduct! how like
&s;uch common love as &s;eeks only its own gratification,
not the happine&s;s or welfare of its object! Could &s;he,
though but lately &s;o dear to me, that all the felicity of
my life &s;eemed to hang upon her, become as nothing,
becau&s;e de&s;tined to another? No! Her father has been
my father, and &s;o long as &s;he retains his re&s;pected name,
I will watch by her uncea&s;ingly.</P>
<P>In their way home, one of the hor&s;es tired, and
could not be made to drag the carriage up to Mount
Plea&s;ant. They were therefore obliged to alight and
walk. Mrs. Arlbery took the arm of Mr. Dennel,
which &s;he did not &s;pare, and his daughter, almo&s;t cry|ing
with &s;leep and fatigue, made the &s;ame u&s;e of Ca|milla's
She prote&s;ted &s;he had never been &s;o long upon
her feet in her life as that very morning in Knowle
Park, and, though &s;he leant upon her companion with
as little &s;cruple as upon a walking &s;tick, &s;he frequently
&s;topt &s;hort, and declared &s;he &s;hould &s;tay upon the road
all night, for &s;he could not move another &s;tep: and
they were &s;till far from the &s;ummit, when &s;he in&s;i&s;ted
upon &s;itting down, &s;aying fretfully, &startq;I am &s;ure I wi&s;h
I was married! Nobody minds me. I am &s;ure if I
was, I would not be &s;erved &s;o. I'm re&s;olved I'll al|ways
have two coaches, one to come after me, and
one to ride in; for I'm determined I won't marry a
<PB N="131" REF="132">
man that has not a great fortune. I'm &s;ure papa
could afford it too, if he'd a mind; only he
won't. Every body vexes me. I'm &s;ure I'm ready
to cry!&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Dennel and Mrs. Arlbery, who neither of them,
at any time, took the &s;malle&s;t notice of what &s;he &s;aid,
pa&s;&s;ed on, and left the whole weight both of her per|&s;on
and her complaints to Camilla. The latter, how|ever,
now reached the ears of a fat, tidy, neat looking
elderly woman, who, in a large black bonnet, and a
blue checked apron, was going their way; &s;he approach|ed
them, and in a good-humoured voice, &s;aid:&mdash;
&startq;What! poor dear! why you &s;eem tired to death?
come, get up, my dear; be of good heart, and you
&s;hall hold by my arm; for that t'other poor thing's al|mo&s;t
hauled to pieces.&endq;</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Dennel accepted both the pity and the pro|po&s;al;
and the &s;ub&s;tantial arm of her new friend, gave
her far &s;uperior aid to the &s;light one of Camilla.</P>
<P>&startq;Well, and how did you like the play, my dears?&endq;
cried the woman.</P>
<P>&startq;La!&endq; &s;aid Mi&s;s Dennel, &startq;how &s;hould you know
we were at the play?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, I have a little bird,&endq; an&s;wered &s;he, &s;agaciou&s;ly
nodding, &startq;that tells me every thing! you &s;at in the
&s;tage box?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Dear! &s;o we did! How can you tell that? Was
you in the gallery?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, my dear, nor yet in the pit neither. And you
had three gentlemen behind you, be&s;ides that gentleman
that's going up the Mount?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Dear! So we had! But how do you know? did
you peep at us behind the &s;cenes?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, my dear; I never went behind the &s;cenes.
But come, I hope you'll do now, for you ha'n't much
further to go.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Dear! how do you know that?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Becau&s;e you live at that pretty hou&s;e, there, up
Mount Plea&s;ant, that's got the little clo&s;et window.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;La, yes! who told you &s;o?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And there's a pretty cat belonging to the hou&s;e,
all &s;treaked brown and black?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="133">
&startq;O, la!&endq; exclaimed Mi&s;s Dennel, half &s;creaming,
and letting go her arm, &startq;I dare &s;ay you're a fortune|teller!
Pray don't &s;peak to me till we get to the
light!&endq;</P>
<P>She now hung back, &s;o terrified that neither Ca|milla
could encourage, nor the woman appea&s;e her; and
&s;he was going to run down the hill, forgetting all her
wearine&s;s, to &s;eek refuge from the &s;ervants, when the
woman &s;aid, &startq;Why what's here to do? Why &s;ee, my
dear, if I mu&s;t let you into the &s;ecret,&mdash;you mu&s;t
know&mdash;but don't tell it to the world!&mdash;I'm a gentle|woman!&endq;
She then removed her checked apron,
and &s;hewed a white mu&s;lin one, embroidered and
flounced.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Dennel was now &s;truck with a &s;urpri&s;e, of which
Camilla bore an equal &s;hare. Their new acquaintance
appeared her&s;elf in &s;ome confu&s;ion, but having exacted
a promi&s;e not to be di&s;covered to <HI>the world,</HI> &s;he told
them, &s;he todged at a hou&s;e upon Mount Plea&s;ant, ju&s;t
by their's, whence &s;he often &s;aw them; that, having
a ticket given her, by a friend, for the play, &s;he
dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf and went into a box, with &s;ome very
genteel company, who kept their coach, and who &s;at
her down afterwards at another friend's, where &s;he
pretended &s;he &s;hould be fetched: &startq;But I do my own
way,&endq; continued &s;he, `and nobody knows a word of
the matter: for I keep a large bonnet, and cloak, and
a checked apron, and a pair of clogs, or pattens, al|ways
at this friend's; and then when I have put them
on, people take me for a mere common per&s;on, and I
walk on, ever &s;o late, and nobody &s;peaks to me; and
&s;o by that means I get my plea&s;ure, and &s;ave my mo|ney;
and yet always appear like a gentlewoman when
I'm known.&endq;</P>
<P>She then again charged them to be di&s;creet, &s;aying
that if this were &s;pread to <HI>the world,</HI> &s;he &s;hould be quite
undone, for many ladies that took her about with them,
would notice her no more. At the &s;ame time, as &s;he
wi&s;hed to make acquaintance with &s;uch pretty young
ladies, &s;he propo&s;ed that they &s;hould all three meet in
<PB N="133" REF="134">
a walk before the hou&s;e, the next morning, and talk to|gether
as if for the fir&s;t time.</P>
<P>Camilla, who de$e&s;ted all tricks, declined entering
into this engagement; but Mi&s;s Dennel, charmed with
the ingenuity of her new acquaintance, accepted the
appointment.</P>
<P>Camilla had, however, her own new friend for the
opening of the next day. &startq;Ah! my &s;weet protectre&s;s!&endq;
cried &s;he, throwing her arms about her neck, &startq;what
am I not de&s;tined to owe you? The very &s;ight of that
man is horror to me. Amiable, generous creature!
what a &s;ight was yours, when turning round, I met
your eyes, and beheld him no more!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Your alarm, at which I cannot wonder,&endq; &s;aid Ca|milla,
&startq;prevented your &s;eeing your &s;afety; for Lord
Newford was with a large party.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, he is obnoxious to my view! wherever I may
&s;ee him, in public or in private, I &s;hall fly him. He
would have torn from me the loved characters of my
heart's be&s;t corre&s;pondent!&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla now felt a little &s;hocked, and colouring and
interrupting her, &s;aid: &startq;Is it po&s;&s;ible, Mrs. Berlin|ton&mdash;&endq;
and &s;topt not knowing how to go on.</P>
<P>&startq;Ah! you know me, then! You know my con|nexions
and my &s;ituation!&endq; cried &s;he, hiding her face
on Camilla's bo&s;om: &startq;tell me, at lea&s;t, tell me, you
do not therefore contemn and abhor me?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Heaven forbid!&endq; &s;aid Camilla, terrified at &s;uch a
preparation; &startq;what can I hear that can give you &s;o
cruel an idea?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Alas! know you not I have prophaned at the altar
my plighted vows to the mo&s;t odious of men? That I
have formed an alliance I de&s;pi&s;e? and that I bear a
name I think of with di&s;gu&s;t, and hate ever to own?&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, thunder&s;truck, an&s;wered; &startq;No, indeed! I
know nothing of all this!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ah! guard your&s;elf, then, well,&endq; cried &s;he, bur&s;t|ing
into tears, &startq;from a &s;imilar fate! My friends are
kind and good, but the temptation of &s;eeing me rich
<PB N="134" REF="135">
beguiled them. I was di&s;intere&s;ted and contented my|&s;elf,
but young and inexperienced; and I yielded to their
pleadings, unaware of their con&s;equences. Alas! I
was utterly ignorant both of my&s;elf and the world! I
knew not how e&s;&s;ential to my own peace was an ami|able
companion; and I knew not, then,&mdash;that the
world contained one ju&s;t formed to make me happy!&endq;</P>
<P>She now hung down her head, weeping and de|&s;ponding.
Camilla &s;ought to &s;ooth her, but was &s;o
amazed, &s;o fearful, and &s;o perplext, &s;he &s;carce knew
what either to &s;ay or to think.</P>
<P>The fair mourner, at length, a little recovering, ad|ded:
&startq;Let me not agitate your gentle bo&s;om with my
&s;orrows. I regard you as an angel &s;ent to con&s;ole
them; but it mu&s;t be by mitigating, not partaking of
them.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla was &s;en&s;ibly touched; and though &s;trangely
at a lo&s;s what to judge, felt her affections deeply inte|re&s;ted</P>
<P>&startq;I dreaded,&endq; &s;he continued, &startq;to tell you my name,
for I dreaded to &s;ink my&s;elf into your contempt, by
your knowledge of an alliance you mu&s;t deem &s;o mer|cenary.
'Twas folly to hope you would not hear it;
yet I wi&s;hed fir&s;t to obtain, at lea&s;t, your good will.
The dear lo&s;t name of Melmond is all I love to pro|nounce!
That name, I believe is known to you; &s;o
may be, al&s;o, perhaps, my brother's unhappy &s;tory?&endq;</P>
<P>Melmond, &s;he then &s;aid, believing Mi&s;s Lynmere
betrothed to Mr. Mandlebert, had quitted Hamp&s;hire
in mi&s;ery, to fini&s;h his vacation in Wales, with their
mutual friends. There he heard that the rumour was
fal&s;e; and would in&s;tantly have returned and thrown
him&s;elf at the feet of the young lady, by who&s;e cou&s;in,
Mr. Lionel Tyrold, he had been told &s;he was to in|herit
a large fortune; when this &s;econd report, al&s;o,
was contradicted, and he learnt that Mi&s;s Lynmere
had almo&s;t nothing; &startq;My brother,&endq; added &s;he, &startq;with
the true &s;pirit of true &s;entiment, was but the more
urgent to pur&s;ue her; but our relations interfered&mdash;and
he, like me, is doomed to endle&s;s angui&s;h!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="136">
The accident, &s;he &s;aid, of the preceding morning,
was owing to her being engaged in reading Rowe's
letters from the dead to the living; which had &s;o in|finitely
inchantrd her, that, de&s;iring to peru&s;e them
without interruption, yet fearing to again wander in
&s;earch of a rural retreat, &s;he had driven to Knowle;
where, hearing the noble family was ab&s;ent, &s;he had
a&s;ked leave to view the park, and there had taken out
her delicious book, which &s;he was enjoying in the
highe&s;t luxury of &s;olitude and &s;weet air, when Lord
Newford broke in upon her.</P>
<P>Camilla enquired if &s;he feared any bad con&s;equences,
by telling Mr. Berlinton of his impertinence</P>
<P>&startq;Heaven forbid,&endq; &s;he an&s;wered, &startq;that I &s;hould be
condemned to &s;peak to Mr. Berlinton of any thing that
concerns or befals me! I &s;ee him as little as I am able,
and &s;peak to him as &s;eldom.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla heard this with grief, but dur&s;t not further
pre&s;s a &s;ubject &s;o delicate. They continued together
till noon, and then reluctantly parted, upon a me&s;&s;age
from Mrs. Arlbery that the carriages were waiting.
Mrs Berlinton declined being introduced to that lady,
which would only, &s;he &s;aid, occa&s;ion interruptions to
their future <HI>t&ecirc;te-&acirc;-t&ecirc;tes.</HI></P>
<P>Neither the thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s of the di&s;po&s;ition, nor
the gaiety of the imagination of Camilla, could di&s;gui&s;e
from her under&s;tanding the glaring eccentricity of this
conduct and character: but &s;he &s;aw them with more of
intere&s;t than blame; the various attractions with which
they were mixed, blending in her opinion &s;omething
between pity and admiration, more captivating, though
more dangerous, to the fond fancy of youth, than the

Clarendel and General Kin&s;ale in attendance; and &s;aw,
from the parlour window, Mi&s;s Dennel &s;auntering be|fore
the hou&s;e, with the newly made acquaintance of
the preceding evening.</P>
<P>The Baronet, who was to drive Mrs. Arlbery, en|quired
if Camilla would not prefer, al&s;o, an open car|riage.
Mrs. Arlbery, &s;econded the motion. Mi&s;s
Dennel, then, running to her father, exclaimed, &startq;Pray
papa, let's take this lady I've been talking with in the
coach with us. She's the good naturede&s;t creature I
ever knew.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Who is &s;he? what's her name?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, I don't know that, papa; but I'll go and a&s;k
her.&endq;</P>
<P>Flying then back, &startq;Pray, ma'am,&endq; &s;he cried,
&startq;what's your name? becau&s;e papa want's to know.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, my dear, my name's Mittin. So you may
think of me when you put on your gloves.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Papa, her name's Mittin,&endq; cried Mi&s;s Dennel,
&s;campering again to her father.</P>
<P>&startq;Well, and who is &s;he?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, la, I'm &s;ure I can't tell, only &s;he's a gentle|woman.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And how do you know that.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;She told me &s;o her&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And where does &s;he live?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ju&s;t by, papa, at that hou&s;e you &s;ee there.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, well, if &s;he's a neighbour, that's enough. I've
no more to &s;ay.&endq;</P>

accepted, and the parties &s;et forward.</P>
<P>The ride was perfectly plea&s;ing to Camilla, now re|vived

to her an&s;wer, conject$red her rea&s;on for re|treating,
and laughed, but &s;aid &s;he would not oppo&s;e
her.</P>
<P>Camilla then begged to wait in Mr. Dennel's carri|age,
that &s;he might keep no one el&s;e from the &s;how.
Sir Sedley, &s;aying it would be an excruciatingly vulgar
&s;ight, propo&s;ed they &s;hould all return; but &s;he pleaded
&s;trongly again&s;t breaking up the party, though, while
&s;he was handed out, to go back to the coach, the Den|nels
and Mrs. Mittin had alighted, and it had driven
off.</P>
<P>The chagrin of Camilla was &s;o palpable, that Mrs.
Arlbery her&s;elf agreed to re&s;ign the &s;cheme; and Sir
Sedley, who drew up to them, &s;aid he &s;hould rejoice in
being delivered from it: but Mi&s;s Dennel, who was
waiting without the booth for her aunt, was ready to
cry at the thought of lo&s;ing the &s;ight, which Mrs. Mittin
had a&s;&s;ured her was extremely pretty; and, after &s;ome
di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, Camilla was reduced to beg &s;he might do no
mi&s;chief, and con&s;ent to make one.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="139">
A more immediate di&s;tre&s;s now occurred to her; &s;he
heard Mr. Dennel call out to the man &s;tationed at the
entrance of the booth, &startq;What's to pay?&endq; and recol|lected
&s;he had no money left.</P>
<P>&startq;What your Honor plea&s;es,&endq; was the an&s;wer, &startq;but
gentlefolks gives half-a-crown.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I'm &s;ure it's well worth it,&endq; &s;aid Mrs. Mittin,
&startq;for it's one of the mo&s;t curious things you ever &s;aw&punc;
You can't give le&s;s, &s;ir.&endq; And &s;he pa&s;&s;ed nimbly by,
without paying at all: but added, &startq;I had a ticket the
fir&s;t day, and now I come every day for nothing, if it
don't rain, for one only need to pay at fir&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Dennel and his daughter followed, and Camilla
was beginning a he&s;itating &s;peech to Mrs Arlbery, as
that lady, not attending to her, &s;aid to Mr. Dennel:
&startq;Well, frank me al&s;o; but take care what you pay;
I'm not at all &s;ure I &s;hall ever return it. All I &s;ave
goes to my ponies.&endq; And, handed by the General,
&s;he cro&s;&s;ed the barrier; not hearing the voice of her
young friend, which was timidly be&s;eeching her to
&s;top.</P>
<P>Camilla was now in extreme confu&s;ion. She put her
hand into her pocket, took it out, felt again, and again
brought forth the hand empty.</P>
<P>The Major, who was before her, and who watched
her, begged leave to &s;ettle with the booth-keeper; but
Camilla, to whom he grew daily more irk&s;ome, again
preferred a &s;hort obligation to the Baronet, and blu&s;h|ingly
a&s;ked if he would once more be her banker?</P>
<P>Sir Sedley, by no means &s;u&s;pecting the nece&s;&s;ity that
urged this conde&s;cen&s;ion, was &s;urpri&s;ed and delighted,
and almo&s;t without knowing it him&s;elf, became all that
was attentive, obliging, and plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>Before they were &s;eated, the young En&s;ign, Mr. Mac|der&s;ey,
i&s;&s;uing from a group of gentlemen, addre&s;&s;ed
him&s;elf to Camilla, though with an air that &s;poke him
much di&s;compo&s;ed and out of &s;pirits. &startq;I hope you are
well, Mi&s;s Camilla Tyrold,&endq; he cried; &startq;and have
left all your family well? particularly the lovelie&s;t of
your &s;ex, that angel of beauty, the divine Mi&s;s Lyn|mere?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="140">
&startq;Except the company pre&s;ent!&endq; &s;aid Mrs. Arlbe|ry;
&startq;always except the company pre&s;ent, when you
talk of beauty to women.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I would not except even the company ab&s;ent!&endq;
replied he, with warmth; but was interrupted from pro|ceeding,
by what the ma&s;ter of the booth called his
<HI>Con&s;ort of Mu&s;ics:</HI> in which not le&s;s than twenty mon|kies
contributed their part; one dreadfully &s;craping a
bow acro&s;s the &s;trings of a vile kit, another beating a
drum, another with a fife, a fourth with a bagpipe, and
the &s;ixteen remainder &s;triking together tongs, &s;hovels,
and pokers, by way of marrowbones and cleavers.
Every body &s;topt their ears, though no one could for|bear
laughing at their various contortions, and horrible
grimaces, till the ma&s;ter of the booth, to keep them,
he &s;aid, in tune, dealt about &s;uch fierce blows with a
&s;tick, that they &s;et up a general howling, which he call|ed
the <HI>Wocal</HI> part of his <HI>Con&s;ort,</HI> not more &s;tunning to the
ear, than offen&s;ive to all humanity. The audience ap|plauded
by loud &s;houts, but Mrs. Arlbery, di&s;gu&s;ted,
ro&s;e to quit the booth. Camilla eagerly &s;tarted up to
&s;econd the motion, but her eyes &s;till more expediti|ou&s;ly
turned from the door, upon encountering tho&s;e of
Edgar; who, having met the empty coach of Mr. Den|nel,
had not been able to refrain from inquiring where
its company had been depo&s;ited; nor, upon hearing it
was at the <HI>accompli&s;hed Monkies,</HI> from ha&s;tening to the
&s;pot, to &s;atisfy him&s;elf if or not Camilla had been &s;teady
to her declaration. But he witne&s;&s;ed at once the pro|priety
of his advice, and its failure.</P>
<P>The ma&s;ter of the booth could not endure to &s;ee the
departure of the mo&s;t brilliant part of his &s;pectators, and
made an harangue, promi&s;ing the company, at large, if
they would &s;ubmit to po&s;tponing the <HI>Con&s;ort,</HI> in order
to oblige his friends the Quality, they &s;hould have it,
with the newe&s;t &s;qualls in ta&s;te, afterwards.</P>
<P>The people laughed and clapped, and Mrs. Arlbery
&s;at down.</P>
<P>In a few minutes, the performers were ready for a
new exhibition. They were dre&s;&s;ed up as &s;oldiers,
<PB N="140" REF="141">
who, headed by a corporal, came forward to do their
exerci&s;es.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, laughing, told the General, as he was
upon duty, he &s;hould him&s;elf take the command: the Ge|neral,
a plea&s;ant, yet cool and &s;en&s;ible man, did not laugh
le&s;s; but the En&s;ign, more warm tempered, and wrong
headed, &s;eeing a feather in a monkey's cap, of the &s;ame
colour, by chance, as in his own, fired with ha&s;ty in|dignation,
and ri&s;ing, called out to the ma&s;ter of the
booth: &startq;What do you mean by this, &s;ir? do you
mean to put an affront upon our corps?&endq;</P>
<P>The man, &s;tartled, was going mu&s;t humbly to prote&s;t
his innocence of any &s;uch de&s;ign; but the laugh rai&s;ed
again&s;t the En&s;ign among&s;t the audience gave him more
courage, and he only &s;impered without &s;peaking.</P>
<P>&startq;What do you mean by grinning at me, &s;ir?&endq; &s;aid
Macder&s;ey; &startq;do you want me to cane you?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Cane me!&endq; cried the man enraged, &startq;by what
rights?&endq;</P>
<P>Macder&s;ey, ea&s;ily put off all guard, was &s;tepping over
the benches, with his cane uplifted, when his next
neighbour, tightly holding him, &s;aid, in a half whi&s;per,
&startq;If you'll take my advice, you'd a deal better provoke
him to &s;trike the fir&s;t blow.&endq;</P>
<P>Macder&s;ey, far more irritated by this coun&s;el than by
the original offence, fiercely looked back, calling out
&startq;The fir&s;t blow! What do you mean by that, &s;ir?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No offence, &s;ir,&endq; an&s;wered the per&s;on; who was
no other than the &s;low and &s;olemn Mr. Dub&s;ter; &startq;but
only to give you a hint for your own good; for if you
&s;trike fir&s;t, being in his own hou&s;e, as one may &s;ay, he
may take the law of you.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The law!&endq; repeated the &s;iery En&s;ign; &startq;the law
was made for poltroons: a man of honour does not
know what it means.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If you talk at that rate, &s;ir,&endq; &s;aid Dub&s;ter, in a
low voice, &startq;it may bring you into trouble.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And who are you, &s;ir, that take upon you the pre|&s;umption
to give me your opinion?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Who am I, &s;ir? I am a gentleman, if you mu&s;t
needs know.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="142">
&startq;A gentleman! who made you &s;o?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Who made me &s;o? why leaving off bu&s;ine&s;s! what
would you have make me &s;o? you may tell me if you
are any better, if you come to that.&endq;</P>
<P>Macder&s;ey, of an ancient and re&s;pectacle family, in|cen&s;ed
pa&s;t mea&s;ure, was turning back upon Mr. Dub|&s;ter;
when the General, taking him gently by the hand,
begged he would recollect him&s;elf.</P>
<P>&startq;That's very true, &s;ir, very true, General!&endq; cried
he, profoundly bowing; &startq;what you &s;ay is very true.
I have no right to put my&s;elf into a pa&s;&s;ion before my
&s;uperior officer, unle&s;s he puts me into it him&s;elf; in
which ca&s;e 'tis his own fault. So I beg your pardon,
General, with all my heart. And I'll go out of the
booth without another half &s;yllable. But if ever I de|tect
any of tho&s;e monkies mocking us, and wearing our
feathers, when you a'n't by, I &s;ha'n't put up with it &s;o
mildly. I hope you'll excu&s;e me, General.&endq;</P>
<P>He then bowed to him again, and begged pardon of
all the ladies; but, in quitting the booth, contemptu|ou&s;ly
&s;aid to Mr. Dub&s;ter: &startq;As to you, you little dirty
fellow, you a'n't worth my notice.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Little dirty fellow!&endq; repeated Mr. Dub&s;ter, when
he was gone; &startq;How come you to think of that? why
I'm as clean as hands can make me!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Come, &s;ir, come,&endq; &s;aid Mrs. Mittin, reaching
over to him, and &s;troking his arm, &startq;don't be angry;
the&s;e things will happen, &s;ometimes, in public compa|nies;
but gentlemen &s;hould be above minding them.
He meant no harm, I dare &s;ay.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, as to that, ma'am,&endq; an&s;wered Mr. Dub&s;ter
proudly, &startq;I don't much care if he did or not: it's no
odds to me. Only I don't know much what right he
has to defame me. I wonder who he thinks he is that
he may break the peace for nothing. I can't &s;ay I'm
much a friend to &s;uch behaviour. Treating people with
&s;o little ceremony.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I prote&s;t,&endq; cried Sir Sedley to Camilla, &startq;'tis your
favourite &s;wain from the Northwick a&s;&s;embly! wafted
on &s;ome zephyr of Hope, he has pur&s;ued you to Tun|bridge.
I flatter my&s;elf he has brought his la&s;t bran
<PB N="142" REF="143">
new cloaths to claim your fair hand at the ma&s;ter of the
ceremonies' ball.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Hu&s;h! hu&s;h!&endq; cried Camilla, in a low voice;
&startq;he will take you literally &s;hould he hear you!&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Dub&s;ter, now perceiving her, bowed low from
the place where he &s;tood, and called out, &startq;How do
you do, ma'am? I a&s;k pardon for not &s;peaking to you
before; but I can't &s;ay as I &s;ee you.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla was forced to bow, though &s;he made no an|&s;wer.
But he continued with his u&s;ual &s;teadine&s;s;
&startq;Why, that was but a unked morning we was toge|ther
&s;o long, ma'am, in my new &s;ummer-hou&s;e. We
was in fine jeopardy, that's the truth of it. Pray, how
does the young gentleman do as took away our ladder?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What a delectable acquaintance!&endq; cried Sir Sed|ley;
&startq;would you have the cruelty to keep &s;uch a trea|&s;ure
to your&s;elf? pre&s;ent me, I &s;upplicate!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, I know you well enough, &s;ir,&endq; &s;aid Mr. Dub|&s;ter,
who overheard him; &startq;I &s;ee you at the hop at the
White Hart; and I believe you know me pretty well
too, &s;ir, if I may take account by your &s;taring. Not
that I mind it in the lea&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Come, come, don't be touchy,&endq; &s;aid Mrs. Mit|tin;
&startq;can't you be good-natured, and hold your
tongue? what &s;ignifies taking things ami&s;s? It only
breeds ill words.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That's very &s;en&s;ibly ob&s;erved upon!&endq; &s;aid Mr.
Dennel; &startq;I don't know when I've heard any thing
more &s;en&s;ibly &s;aid.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, as to that, I don't take it ami&s;s in the lea&s;t,&endq;
cried Mr. Dub&s;ter; &startq;if the gentleman's a mind to
&s;tare, let him &s;tare. Only I &s;hould like to know what
it's for. It's no better than child's play, as one may
&s;ay, making one look fooli&s;h for nothing.&endq;</P>
<P>The ourang outang was now announced, and Mrs.
Arlbery immediately left the booth, accompanied by
her party, and &s;peedily followed by Edgar.</P>
<P>Neither of the carriages were in waiting, but they
would not return to the booth. Sir Sedley, to whom
&s;tanding was &s;till rather inconvenient, begged a ca&s;t in
<PB N="143" REF="144">
the carriage of a friend, who was accidentally pa&s;&s;ing
by.</P>
<P>Macder&s;ey, who joined them, &s;aid he had been con|&s;idering
what that fellow had propo&s;ed to him, of tak|ing
the fir&s;t blow, and found he could not put up with
it: and upon the appearance of Mr. Dub&s;ter, who in
quitting the booth was preparing, with his u&s;ual lei&s;ure|ly
&s;olemnity, to approach Camilla, darted forward and
&s;eizing him by the collar, exclaimed, &startq;Retract, &s;ir!
Retract!&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Dub&s;ter &s;tared, at fir&s;t, without &s;peech or oppo|&s;ition;
but being relea&s;ed by the Major, whom the Ge|neral
begged to interfere, he angrily &s;aid: &startq;Pray, &s;ir,
what bu&s;ine&s;s have you to take hold of a body in &s;uch
a manner as that? It's an a&s;&s;ault, &s;ir, and &s;o I can
prove. And I'm glad of it; for now I can &s;erve you
as I did another gentleman once before, that I &s;marted
out of a good ten pound out of his pocket, for a knock
he gave me, for a mere nothing, ju&s;t like this here pul|ling
one by the collar, nobody knows why.&endq;</P>
<P>The Major, endeavouring to quiet Macder&s;ey, advi&s;ed
him to de&s;pi&s;e &s;o low a per&s;on.</P>
<P>&startq;So I will, my dear friend,&endq; he returned, &startq;as
&s;oon as ever I have given him the proper cha&s;ti&s;ement
for his ignorance. But I mu&s;t do that fir&s;t. You
won't take it ill, Major.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I believe,&endq; cried Mr. Dub&s;ter, holding up both
his hands, &startq;the like of this was never heard of!
Here's a gentleman, as he calls him&s;elf, ready to take
away my life, with his own good will, for nothing but
giving him a little bit of advice! However, it's all one
to me. The law is open to all. And if any one plays
their tricks upon me, they &s;hall pay for their fun. I'm
none of your tame ones to put up with &s;uch a thing for
nothing. I'm above that, I promi&s;e you.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Don't talk, &s;ir, don't talk!&endq; cried Macder&s;ey;
&startq;it's a thing I can't bear from a mean per&s;on, to be
talked to. I had a hundred thou&s;and times rather &s;tand
to be &s;hot at.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Not talk, &s;ir? I &s;hould be glad to know what
right you has to hinder me, provided I &s;ay nothing
<PB N="144" REF="145">
again&s;t the law? And as to being a mean per&s;on, it's
more than you can prove, for I'm &s;ure you don't know
who I am, nor nothing about me. I may be a lord,
for any thing you know, though I don't pretend to &s;ay I
am. But as to what people take me for, that behave &s;o
out of character, it's what I &s;ha'n't trouble my head
about. They may take me for a chimney-&s;weeper, or
they may take me for a duke; which they like. I
&s;ha'n't tell them whether I'm one or t'other, or whether
I'm neither. And as to not talking, I &s;hall hold my
tongue when I think proper.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;A&s;k my pardon this in&s;tant, fellow!&endq; cried the
En&s;ign, whom the Major, at the motion of the Gene|ral,
now caught by the arm, and hurried from the &s;pot:
Mrs. Mittin, at the &s;ame moment pulling away Mr.
Dub&s;ter, and notably expounding to him the advantages
of patience and good humour.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, wearied both of this &s;quabble and of
waiting, took the arm of the General, and &s;aid &s;he
would walk home; Mi&s;s Dennel lovingly held by Mrs.
Mittin, with whom her father al&s;o a&s;&s;orted, and by
whom Mr. Dub&s;ter was drawn on.</P>
<P>Camilla alone had no immediate companion, as the
Major was occupied by the En&s;ign. Edgar &s;aw her
di&s;engaged. He trembled, he wavered; he wi&s;hed the
Major back; he wi&s;hed him &s;till more at a di&s;tance too
remote ever to return; he thought he would in&s;tantly
mount his hor&s;e, and gallop towards Beech Park; but
the hor&s;e was not ready, and Camilla was in &s;ight;&mdash;
and, in le&s;s than a minute, he found him&s;elf, &s;carce
knowing how, at her &s;ide.</P>
<P>Camilla felt a plea&s;ure that bounded to her heart,
though the late a&s;&s;ertions of Mrs. Arlbery prepared her
to expect him. He knew not, however, what to &s;ay;
he felt mortified and di&s;appointed, and when he had
uttered &s;omething &s;carce intelligible about the weather,
he walked on in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>Camilla, who&s;e pre&s;ent train of thoughts had no di&s;|cordant
tendency, broke through this &s;trangene&s;s her|&s;elf,
and &s;aid: &startq;How frivolous I mu&s;t appear to you!
<PB N="145" REF="146">
but indeed I was at the very door of the booth, before
I knew whither the party was going.'</P>
<P>&startq;You did not, I hope, at lea&s;t,&endq; he cried, &startq;when
you had entered it, deem me too rigid, too au&s;tere,
that I thought the &s;pecies, both of company and of en|tertainment,
ill calculated for a young lady?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Rigid! au&s;tere!&endq; repeated &s;he; &startq;I never thought
you either! never&mdash;and if once again&mdash;&endq; &s;he &s;topt;
embarra&s;&s;ed, a&s;hamed.</P>
<P>&startq;If once again what?&endq; cried he in a tremulous
voice; &startq;what would Mi&s;s Camilla &s;ay?&mdash;would &s;he
again&mdash;Is there yet&mdash;What would Mi&s;s Camilla &s;ay?&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla felt confounded, both with ideas of what
he meant to allude to, and what con&s;truction he had
put upon her half fini&s;hed &s;entence. Impatient, howe|ver,
to clear that, &startq;If once more,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;you
could prevail with your&s;elf&mdash;now and then&mdash;from time
to time&mdash;to give me an hint, an idea&mdash;of what you
think right&mdash;I will promi&s;e, if not a con&s;tant ob&s;erv|ance,
at lea&s;t a never-failing &s;en&s;e of your kindne&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P>The revul&s;ion in the heart, in the whole frame of
Edgar, was almo&s;t too powerful for re&s;traint: he pant|ed
for an immediate explanation of every pa&s;t and every
pre&s;ent difficulty, and a final avowal that &s;he was either
&s;elf-de&s;tined to the Major, or that he had no rival to
fear: But before he could make any an&s;wer, a &s;udden
and violent &s;hower broke up the conference, and group|ed
the whole party under a large tree.</P>
<P>This interruption, however, had no power upon their
thoughts; neither of them heard a word that was &s;ay|ing;
each ruminated intently, though confu&s;edly, upon
what already was pa&s;&s;ed. Yet where the wind preci|pitated
the rain, Edgar &s;tationed him&s;elf, and held his
hat to intercept its pa&s;&s;age to Camillia; and as her eye
involuntarily was caught by the &s;hower that pattered
upon his head and &s;houlders, &s;he in&s;en&s;ibly pre&s;&s;ed near|er
to the trunk of the tree, to afford more &s;helter to him
from its branches.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the party partook not of this tacitur|nity:
Mr. Dub&s;ter, &s;taring Mrs. Mittin full in the face,
<PB N="146" REF="147">
exclaimed: &startq;I think I ought to know you, ma'am,
a&s;king your pardon?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No matter for that!&endq; cried &s;he, turning with
quickne&s;s to Camilla; &startq;Lord, mi&s;s&mdash;I don't know
your name,&mdash;how your poor hat is all I don't know
how! as limp, and as flimzy, as if it had been in a
wa&s;h-tub!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I've ju&s;t bethought me&punc;&endq; continued he, &startq;where it
was we u&s;ed to &s;ee one another, and all the whole man|ner
of it. I've got it as clear in my head as if it was
but ye&s;terday. Don't you remember&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Can't you &s;tand a little out there?&endq; interrupted
&s;he; &startq;what &s;ignifies a man's old coat? don't you &s;ee
how you let all the rain come upon this young lady?
you &s;hould never think of your&s;elf, but only of what
you can do to be obliging.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;A very good rule, that! a very good one indeed!&endq;
&s;aid Mr Dennel; &startq;I wi&s;h every body would mind it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I'm as willing to mind it, I believe &s;aid Mr. Dub|&s;ter,
&startq;as my neighbours; but as to being wet through,
for m$re complai&s;ance, I don't think it fair to expect
&s;uch a thing of nobody. Be&s;ides, this is not &s;uch
an old coat as you may think for. If you was to &s;ee
what I wear at home, I promi&s;e you would not think
&s;o bad of it. I don't &s;ay it's my be&s;t; who'd be fool
then, to wear it every day? However, I believe it's
pretty nigh as good as that I had on that night I &s;aw
you at Mrs. Purdle's, when, you know, one of your
pattens&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Come, come, what's the man talking about? one
per&s;on &s;hould not take all the conver&s;ation up &s;o. Dear
mi&s;s&mdash;do tell me your name?&mdash;I am &s;o &s;orry for your
hat, I can't but think of it; it looks as dingy!&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, now, you won't make me believe,&endq; &s;aid
Mr. Dub&s;ter, &startq;you've forgot how your patten broke;
and how I &s;queezed my finger under the iron? And
how I'd like to have lo&s;t the u&s;e of it? There would
have been a fine job! And how Mrs. Purdle&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I'm &s;ure the &s;hower's over,&endq; cried Mrs. Mittin,
&startq;and if we &s;tay here, we &s;hall have all the droppings
<PB N="147" REF="148">
of the leaves upon us. Poor mi&s;s thing-o-me's hat is
&s;poilt already. There's no need to make it wor&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And how Mrs. Purdle,&endq; he continued, was oblig|ed
to lend you a pair of &s;hoes and &s;tockings, becau&s;e
you was wet through your feet? And how they would
not fit you, and kept tumbling off? And how, when
&s;omebody come to fetch you in their own coach, you
made us &s;ay you was taken ill becau&s;e you was &s;o
daubed with mud and mire, you was a&s;hamed to &s;hew
your&s;elf? And how&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I can't think what you are talking of&endq; &s;aid Mrs.
Mittin; &startq;but come, let's you and I go a little way on,
to &s;ee if the rain's over.&endq; She then went &s;ome paces
from the tree, and &s;aid: &startq;What &s;ignifies running on
&s;o, Mr Dub&s;ter, about things nobody knows any thing
of? It's tiring all the company to death. You &s;hould
never talk about your own &s;ingers, and hap-hazards,
to genteel people. You &s;hould only talk about agree|able
&s;ubjects as I do. See how they all like me! That
gentleman brought me to the monkies in his own
coach.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;As to that,&endq; an&s;wered he, gravely, &startq;I did not
mean&punc; in the lea&s;t, to &s;ay any thing di&s;agreeable; only
I thought it odd you &s;hould not &s;eem to know me again,
con&s;idering Mrs. Purdle u&s;ed&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why you've no nous, Mr. Dub&s;ter; Mrs. Purdle's
a very good &s;ort of woman and the be&s;t friend I have
in the world&punc; perhaps, at the bottom; but &s;he i'n't a
&s;ort of per&s;on to talk of before gentlefolks. You
&s;hould talk to great people about their own affairs,
and what you can do to plea&s;e them, and find out how
you can &s;erve them, if you'd be treated genteelly by
them, as I am. Why, I go every where, and &s;ee every
thing and it co&s;ts me nothing A friend, a lady of
great fa&s;hion, took me one day to the monkies, and
paid for me; and I've gone &s;ince, whenever I will for
nothing.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Nobody treats me to nothing,&endq; an&s;wered he, in a
melancholy voice, &startq;whatever's the rea&s;on: except:
when I make friends with &s;omebody that can let me
in free, &s;ometimes. And I get a peep, now and then,
at what goes forward, that way.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="149">
&startq;But you are rich enough to pay for your&s;elf now,
Mr. Dub&s;ter; good lack! if I had &s;uch a fortune as
yours, I'd go all the the world over, and thanks to no|body.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And how long would you be rich then, Mrs.
Mittin? Who'd give you your money again when you'd
&s;pent it? I got mine hard enough. I &s;ha'n't fool it
away in a hurry, I promi&s;e you!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I can't &s;ay I &s;ee that, Mr. Dub&s;ter, when two of
your wives died &s;o &s;oon, and left you &s;o hand&s;ome.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, yes, I don't &s;ay to the contrary of that;
but then, think of the time before, when I was 'pren|tice!&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;hower was now over, and the party proceeded
as before.</P>
<P>Edgar, uncertain, irre&s;olute, walked on in &s;ilence:
yet attentive, a&s;&s;iduous, even tenderly watchful to guide,
guard, and a&s;&s;i&s;t his fair companion in her way. The
name of the Major trembled perpetually upon his lips;
but fear what might be the re&s;ult of his inquiries &s;topt
his &s;peech till they approached the hou&s;e; when he
commanded voice to &s;ay: &startq;You permit then the re|newal
of my old privilege?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Permit! I wi&s;h for it!'</P>
<P>They were now at the door. Edgar, not daring to
&s;peak again to Camilla, and not able to addre&s;s any one
el&s;e, took his leave; enchanted that he was authoriz|ed,
once more, to inform him&s;elf with openne&s;s of
the &s;tate of her affairs, and of her conduct. And
Camilla, dwelling with delight upon the di&s;cernment
of Mrs. Arlbery, ble&s;t the happy penetration that had
endowed her with courage to &s;peak again to Edgar
in terms of friend&s;hip and confidence.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mittin, declaring &s;he could not eat till &s;he had
&s;een what could be done for the hat of Mi&s;s Tyrold,
accompanied her up &s;tairs, took it off her&s;elf, wiped
it, &s;moothed, and tried to new arrange it; and, at
la&s;t, failing to &s;ucceed, in&s;i&s;ted upon taking it home,
to put it in order, and promi&s;ed to return it in the
morning time enough for the Pa$tiles. Camilla was
much a&s;hamed; but &s;he had no means to buy another,
<PB N="149" REF="150">
and &s;he had now lo&s;t her indifference to going abroad.
She thought, therefore, this new acquaintance at lea&s;t
as u&s;eful as &s;he was officious, and accepted her civility
with thanks.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="18" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">$word$ Rooms.</HEAD>
<P>THE evening, as u&s;ual, was de&s;tined to the Rooms.
The fir&s;t object Camilla perceived upon her entrance was
Edgar, and the &s;mile with which &s;he met his eye
brought him in&s;tantly to her &s;ide. That &s;mile was not
le&s;s radiant for his nearer approach; nor was the plea|fure
in it le&s;s animated for ob&s;erving that Major Cer|wood
was not of her party, nor as yet in the room.
The opportunity &s;eemed inviting to engage her him&s;elf,
to &s;ugge&s;t and to find it irre&s;i&s;tible was the &s;ame thing,
and he inquired if her whole evening were arranged, or
&s;he would go down two dances with an old friend.</P>
<P>The &s;oftne&s;s of her a&s;&s;ent was even exqui&s;ite delight
to him; and, as they all walked up and down the
apartment, though he addre&s;&s;ed her but little, and
though &s;he &s;poke but in an&s;wer, every word he uttered
&s;he received as couching &s;ome gentle meaning, and eve|ry
&s;yllable &s;he replied, he thought conveyed &s;omething
of flattering intere&s;t: and although all was upon open
and unavoidable &s;ubjects, he had no eyes but for her,
&s;he had no attention but for him.</P>
<P>This quiet, yet heart-felt intercour&s;e, was &s;oon a
little interrupted by the appearance of a large and &s;trik|ing
party, led on by Lady Alithea Selmore; for which
every body made way, to which every body turned,
and which, pa&s;&s;ing by all the company without &s;e$ming
<PB N="150" REF="151">
con&s;cious there was any to pa&s;s, formed a ma&s;s at the
upper end of the room, with an air and manner of &s;uch
exclu&s;ive attention to their chief, or to one another,
that common ob&s;ervation would have concluded &s;ome
film before their eyes ob&s;tructed their di&s;cerning that
they were not the &s;ole engro&s;&s;ers of the apartment.</P>
<P>But &s;uch was not the judgment formed of them by
Mrs. Arlbery, who, forced by the &s;tream to give them
pa&s;&s;age, paid her&s;elf for the conde&s;cen&s;ion by a com|mentary
upon the pa&s;&s;engers. &startq;Tho&s;e good people,&endq;
&s;aid &s;he, &startq;&s;trive to make us believe we are nothing to
them. They &s;trive even to believe it them&s;elves. But
this is the mere &s;emblance worn by pride and affectation,
to veil internal fatigue. They come hither to recruit
their exhau&s;ted powers, not, indeed, by joining in our
&s;ociety, but by a view of new objects for their &s;en&s;es,
and the flattering idea, for their minds, of the envy or
admiration they excite. They are all people of &s;ome
con&s;equence, and many of them are people of title:
but the&s;e are far the mo&s;t &s;upportable of the group;
their privileged &s;uperiority over the re&s;t is &s;o marked
and indi&s;putable, that they are &s;aved the trouble either
of claiming or a&s;certaining it: but tho&s;e who approach
their rank without reaching it, live in a con&s;tant &s;trug|gle
to make known their importance. Indeed, I have
often &s;een that people of title are le&s;s gratified with the
&s;ound of their own honours, than people of no title in
pronouncing them.&endq;</P>
<P>Sir Sedley Clarendel was of this &s;et. Like the re&s;t
he pa&s;&s;ed Mrs. Arlbery without &s;eeming to notice her,
and was pa&s;&s;ing Camilla in the &s;ame manner; but not
aware this was only to be &s;ine, like the party to
which he belonged, &s;he very innocently &s;poke to him
her&s;elf, to hope he got &s;afe to his lodgings, without
feeling any further ill effect from his accident.</P>
<P>Sir Sedley, though internally much gratified by this
intere&s;t in his &s;afety, which in Camilla was the re&s;ult
of having her&s;elf endangered it looked as if be &s;carce
recollected her, and making ha&s;tily a kind of half bow,
walked on with his company.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="152">
Camilla, who had no view, nor one &s;erious thought
concerning him, was rather amu&s;ed than di&s;plea&s;ed by
his caprices; and was preparing to relate the hi&s;tory
of his lamene&s;s to Edgar, who &s;eemed &s;urpri&s;ed and
even hurt by her addre&s;&s;ing him, and by his &s;o &s;lightly
pa&s;&s;ing her, when the entrance of another &s;plendid party
interrupted all di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>And here, to her utter amaze&punc; &s;he beheld as chief
of the group, her romantic new friend; not leading,
indeed, like Lady Alithca Selmore, a train, but &s;ur|rounded
by admirers, who, &s;eeking no eye but hers,
&s;eemed dim and humble planets, moving round a ra|diant
&s;un.</P>
<P>Camilla, now forgetting Sir Sedley, would have
taken this moment to narrate her adventure with Mrs.
Berlinton, had not her de&s;ign been defeated by the
approach of the Major. He belonged to this la&s;t group,
but was the only one that &s;eparated from it. He &s;poke
to Camilla with his u&s;ual air of devotion, told her he
had dined with Mrs, Berlinton, to who&s;e hu&s;band,
whom he had taken for her grandfather, he had been
ju&s;t introduced; and begged to know of Mrs. Arl|bery
if he might have the plea&s;ure of bringing them
all acquainted; an offer which Camilla, unauthori&s;ed
by Mrs. Berlinton, had not ventured to make. Mrs.
Arlbery declined the propo&s;al; not anxious to mix
where &s;he had &s;mall chance of pre&s;iding.</P>
<P>The party&punc; after traver&s;ing the room, took full and
exclu&s;ive po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a con&s;iderable &s;pot ju&s;t below that
occupied by Lady Alithea.</P>
<P>The&s;e two companies completely engro&s;&s;ed all atten|tion,
amply &s;upplying the re&s;t of the a&s;&s;embly with to|pics
for di&s;cour&s;e. The &s;et with Lady Alithea Sel|more,
was, in general, haughty, &s;upercilious, and
taciturn; looking around with eyes determined to &s;ee
neither any per&s;on nor any thing before them, and
rarely &s;peaking&punc; except to applaud what fell from her
lady&s;hip; who far le&s;s proud, becau&s;e a lover of popu|larity,
deigned her&s;elf, from time to time, a &s;light
glance at the company, to &s;ee if &s;he was ob&s;erved, and
to enjoy its reverence.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="153">
The party to which Mrs. Berlinton was the load|&s;tone,
was far more artractive to the di&s;ciples of na|ture,
though le&s;s &s;edulou&s;ly &s;ought by tho&s;e whom the
manners and maxims of the common world had &s;ophi&s;|ticated.
They were gay, elegant, de&s;irous to plea&s;e,
becau&s;e plea&s;ed them&s;elves; and though &s;ome of them
harboured de&s;igns deeper and more dangerous than any
formed by the votaries of rank, they appeared to have
nothing more in view than to decorate with flowers the
pre&s;ent moment. The magnetic influence of beauty
was, however, more powerful than that of the <HI>ton;</HI>
for though Mrs. Berlinton, from time to time, allured
a beau from Lady Alithea Selmore, her lady&s;hip, dur|ing
the whole &s;ea&s;on, had not one retaliation to boa&s;t.
But, on the other hand, the females, in general, &s;trove
to clu&s;ter about Lady Alithea; Mrs. Berlinton leav|ing
them no greater chance of rival&s;hip in conver&s;ation
than in charms.</P>
<P>Edgar had made way upon the approach of the
Major, who wore an air of &s;uperior claim extremely
unplea&s;ant to him; but, &s;ince already engaged to Ca|milla,
he meant to return to her when the dancing
began.</P>
<P>She concluded he left her but to &s;peak to &s;ome ac|quaintance,
and was, her&s;elf, amply occupied in ob&s;erv|ing
her new friend. The light in which &s;he now beheld
her, admired, pur&s;ued, and adulated, elegantly adorn|ed
in her per&s;on, and evidently with but one rival for
fame and fa&s;hion in Tunbridge, filled her with a&s;to|ni&s;hment.
Nothing could le&s;s a&s;&s;ort with her pa&s;&s;ion
for &s;olitude, her fondne&s;s for literary and &s;entimental
di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, and her enthu&s;ia&s;m in friend&s;hip. But her
&s;urpri&s;e was mixed with prai&s;e and admiration, when
&s;he reflected upon the &s;oft humility and care&s;&s;ing &s;weet|ne&s;s
of her manners, yet found her, by general con&s;ent,
holding this elevated rank in &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The Major earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed to conduct Camilla to
this coterie, a&s;&s;uring her Mrs. Berlinton would not
have pa&s;&s;ed, had &s;he &s;een her, for, during dinner, and
at coffee, &s;he had talked of nobody el&s;e. Camilla
heard this with plea&s;ure, but &s;hrunk from all advances,
<PB N="153" REF="154">
and &s;trove rather to hide than &s;hew her&s;elf, that Mrs.
Berlinton might have full liberty either to &s;eek or
avoid her. She wi&s;hed to con&s;ult Edgar upon this ac|quaintance;
though the pre&s;ent &s;plendour of her ap|pearance&punc;
and the number of her followers, made her
fear &s;he could never induce him to do ju&s;tice to the
&s;weetne&s;s and endearment of her &s;ocial powers.</P>
<P>When the Major found he pleaded in vain, he &s;aid
he would at lea&s;t let Mrs. Berlinton know where to look
for her; and went him&s;elf to that lady.</P>
<P>Edgar, who had felt &s;en&s;ibly mortified to ob&s;erve,
when he retreated, that the eyes and attention of Ca|milla
had been wholly be&s;towed upon what he con&s;ider|ed
merely as a new &s;cene, was now coming forward;
when he &s;aw Mrs. Berlinton ha&s;tily ri&s;e, &s;uddenly
break from all her adulators, and, with quick &s;teps and
animated ge&s;tures, traver&s;e the apartment, to addre&s;s
Camilla, whom taking by both her hands, which &s;he
pre&s;&s;ed to her heart, &s;he conjured, in the mo&s;t flattering
terms, to accompany her back.</P>
<P>Camilla was much gratified; yet, from delicacy to
Mrs. Arlbery, &s;timulated by the fear of mi&s;&s;ing her ex|pected
partner in the country dances, declined the invi|tation:
Mrs. Berlinton looked di&s;appointed; but
&s;aid &s;he would not be importunate, and returned
alone.</P>
<P>Camilla, a little di&s;turbed, be&s;ought the Major to
follow, with an offer of &s;pending with her, if &s;he plea&s;|ed,
the whole of the en&s;uing day.</P>
<P>&startq;Charming!&endq; cried the Major, &startq;for I am engaged
to her my&s;elf already.&endq;</P>
<P>To Camilla this hearing was di&s;tre&s;&s;ing; to Edgar
it was &s;carcely endurable. But &s;he could not retract,
and Edgar was &s;topt in the inquiries he meant to make
concerning this &s;triking new acquaintance, by an abrupt
declaration from Mrs. Arlbery, that the Rooms were
in&s;ufferable, and &s;he would immediately go home. She
then gave her hand to the General, and Mi&s;s Dennel
took the arm of Camilla, murmuring, that &s;he would
never leave the Rooms at &s;uch an early hour again,
when once &s;he was married.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="155">
To quit Edgar thus, at the very moment of renewed
intercour&s;e and amity, &s;eemed too cruel; and Camilla,
though with blu&s;hes, and &s;tammering, whi&s;pered Mrs.
Arlbery, &startq;What can I do, ma'am? mo&s;t unfortunate|ly
I have engaged my&s;elf to dance.?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;With whom?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;With&mdash;Mr.&mdash;Mandlebert.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, va&s;tly well! Stay, then by all means: but, as
he has not engaged me too, allow me I be&s;eech you
to e&s;cape Mrs Berlinton will, I am &s;ure, be happy
to take care of you.&endq;</P>
<P>This &s;cheme was, to Camilla, the mo&s;t plea&s;ant that
could be propo&s;ed; and, at the &s;ame in&s;tant, the Ma|jor
returned to her, with the&s;e words written with a
pencil upon the back of a letter.</P>
<P>&startq;To-morrow, and next day, and next day, come to
me, my lovely friend; every thing, and every body fa|tigues
me but your&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, obliged again to have recour&s;e to the Ma|jor,
wrote, upon the &s;ame paper, &startq;Can you have the
goodne&s;s to convey me to Mount Plea&s;ant to-night,&endq; if I
&s;tay? and begged him to bring her an an&s;wer. She en|treated,
al&s;o, Mrs. Arlbery to &s;top, till it arrived, which
was almo&s;t in the &s;ame minute; for the eye of Mrs. Ber|linton
had but glanced upon the words, ere her &s;oft
and lovely form was again with their fair writer, with
whom, &s;miling and delighted, &s;he walked back, arm in
arm, to her place.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery and the General, and Mr. and Mi&s;s
Dennel, now le&s;t the room.</P>
<P>Edgar viewed all this with amazement. He found
that the young lady &s;he joined was &s;i&s;ter-in-law to a peer,
and as fa&s;hionable as &s;he was beautiful; but could not
fathom how &s;o great an intimacy had &s;o &s;uddenly been
formed.</P>
<P>Camilla, thus di&s;tingui&s;hed, became now her&s;elf an
object of peculiar notice; her own per&s;onal claim to par|ticular
attention her dejection had forfeited, for it had
robbed her eyes of their animation, and her countenance
of its play; but no contagion &s;preads with greater cer|tainty
nor greater &s;peed than that of fa&s;hion; &s;lander it|&s;elf
<PB N="155" REF="156">
is not more &s;ure of promulgation. She was now
looked at by all pre&s;ent as if &s;een for the fir&s;t time;
every one di&s;covered in her &s;ome charm, &s;ome grace,
&s;ome excellence; tho&s;e who, the minute before, had
pa&s;&s;ed her with perfect indifference, &s;aid it was impo&s;|&s;ible
to &s;ee and not be &s;truck with her; and all agreed
the could appear upon no &s;pot under the &s;un, and not
in&s;tinctively be &s;ingled out, as formed to &s;hine in the
highe&s;t &s;phere.</P>
<P>But he by whom this tran&s;action was ob&s;erved with
mo&s;t plea&s;ure, was Sir Sedley Clarendel. The extra|ordinary
&s;ervice he had performed for Camilla, and the
grateful intere&s;t &s;he had &s;hewn him in return, had led
him to con&s;ider her with an attention &s;o favourable,
that, without half her merit, or half her beauty, &s;he
could not have failed ri&s;ing in his e&s;timation, and ex|citing
his regard: and &s;he had now a &s;uperior charm
that di&s;tanced every other; &s;he had been a&s;ked to dance,
yet refu&s;ed it, by a man of celebrity in the <HI>ton;</HI> and &s;he
was publicly &s;ought and care&s;&s;ed by the only rival at
Tunbridge, in that &s;pecies of renoun, to Lady Alithea
Selmore.</P>
<P>He felt an increa&s;ed de&s;ire to be pre&s;ented to Mrs.
Berlinton him&s;elf; and, gliding from his own circle as
quietly as he could contrive, not to offend Lady Alithea,
who, though &s;he laughed at <HI>the little Wel&s;h ru&s;tic,</HI> was
watchful of her votaries, and jealous of her ri&s;ing power,
came gently behind Lord O'Lerney and whi&s;pered his
reque&s;t.</P>
<P>He was received by the young beauty with that grace,
and that &s;weetne&s;s which rendered her &s;o generally be|witching,
yet with an air that proved her already accu&s;|tomed
to admiration, and untouched by its intoxicating
qualities&punc; All that was voluntary of her attention was
be&s;towed exclu&s;ively upon Camilla, though, when ad|dre&s;&s;ed
and called upon by others, &s;he an&s;wered without
impatience, and looked without di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>This conduct, at the &s;ame time that it &s;hewed her in
a point of view the mo&s;t amiable, rai&s;ed Camilla higher
and higher in the eyes of the bye-&s;tanders: and, in a
few minutes more, the general cry throughout the a&s;|&s;embly
<PB N="156" REF="157">
was to inquire who was the young lady thus
brought forward by Mrs Berlinton.</P>
<P>Edgar heard this with increa&s;ed anxiety. Has &s;he
di&s;cretion, has &s;he fortitude, thought he, to with&s;tand
public di&s;tinction? Will it not &s;poil her for private life;
e&s;trange her from family concerns? render ta&s;tele&s;s and
in&s;ipid the conjugal and maternal characters, meant by
Nature to form not only the mo&s;t &s;acred of duties, but
the mo&s;t delicious of enjoyments?</P>
<P>Very &s;oon after, this anxiety was tinctured with a
a feeling more &s;evere; he &s;aw her &s;poken to negligently
by Sir Sedley; he required, after what he had already
him&s;elf deemed impertinence from the Baronet, that
&s;he &s;hould have a&s;&s;umed to him a di&s;tant dignity; but he
perceived, on the contrary, that &s;he an&s;wered him with
plea&s;ant alacrity, and, when not engaged by Mrs.
Berlinton, attended to him, even with di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>Alas! thought he the degradation from the true fe|male
character is already begun! already the lure of fa|&s;hion
draws her from what &s;he owes to delicacy and
propriety, to give a willing reception to in&s;olence and
foppery!</P>
<P>Camilla, mean while, un&s;u&s;picious of his remarks, and
per&s;uaded every civility in her power was due to Sir
Sedley, was gay, plea&s;ed, and plea&s;ing; happy to con&s;i|der
her&s;elf under the guidance, and re&s;tored to the amity
of Edgar, and determined to acquaint him with all her
affairs, and con&s;ult him upon all her proceedings</P>
<P>The dancing, for which mutually they langui&s;hed, as
the mutual means of re-union&punc; &s;eemed not to be the hu|mour
of the evening, and tho&s;e who were ready for it,
were not of &s;ufficient con&s;equence to bring it forward.
But when Mrs. Berlinton mentioned, that &s;he had
been taking &s;ome le&s;&s;ons in a co$illon, a univer&s;al cry
was rai&s;ed by all her party, to try one immediately. She
pleaded in vain her inexperience in &s;uch dances; they
in&s;i&s;ted there was nobody pre&s;ent that could critici&s;e,
that her form alone would compen&s;ate for every mi&s;take
of rule, and that the be&s;t le&s;&s;on was ea&s;y practice.</P>
<P>She was &s;oon gained, for &s;he was not addicted to de|nials;
but the application which en&s;ued to Camilla was
<PB N="157" REF="158">
acceded to le&s;s promptly. As there were but two other
ladies in the circle of Mrs. Berlinton, her a&s;&s;i&s;tance was
declared to be inde&s;pen&s;able. She pleaded inability of
every &s;ort, though to dance without Edgar was her only
real objection; for &s;he had no fal&s;e &s;hame in being ig|norant
of what &s;he never had learnt. But Mrs. Ber|linton
prote&s;ted &s;he would not ri&s;e if &s;he were the only
novice to be exhibited; and the Major then prepared to
pro&s;trate him&s;elf at the feet of Camilla; who, ha&s;tily,
and a&s;hamed, &s;tood up, to prevent an action that Edgar
might mi&s;interpret.</P>
<P>Hoping, however, now, to at lea&s;t draw him into
their &s;et, &s;he ventured to acknowledge to Mrs. Berlin|ton,
that &s;he was already engaged, in ca&s;e &s;he danced.</P>
<P>The Major, who heard her, and who knew it was
not to him&s;elf, &s;trenuou&s;ly declared this could only be
for country dances, and therefore would not interfere
with a cotillon.</P>
<P>&startq;Will country dances, then,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, blu&s;hing,
&startq;follow?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Certainly, if any one has &s;pirit to begin them.&endq;</P>
<P>The cotillon was now played, and the preceding bow
from the oppo&s;ite Major forced her court&s;ie in return.</P>
<P>The little &s;kill in this dance of one of the performers,
and the total want of it in another, made it a m$re plea|&s;antry
to all, though the youth and beauty of the two
who did the wor&s;t, rendered them objects of admiration,
that left nearly unnoticed tho&s;e who did be&s;t</P>
<P>To Camilla what belonged to plea&s;antry in this bu&s;i|ne&s;s
was of &s;hort duration. When the cotillon was
over&punc; &s;he &s;aw nothing of Edgar. She looked around,
mortified, di&s;appointed. No one called for a country
dance; and the few who had wi&s;hed for it, concluding
all chance over when a cotillon was begun, had now re|tired,
or given it up.</P>
<P>What was this di&s;appointment, compared with the
&s;ufferings of Edgar? Something of a conte&s;t, and of en|treaties
had reached his ears, while he had hovered
near the party, or &s;trolled up and down the room. He
had gathered the &s;ubject was dancing, and he &s;aw the
Major mo&s;t earne&s;t with Camilla. He was &s;ure it was
<PB N="158" REF="159">
for her hand, and concluded it was for a country dance;
but could &s;he forfeit her engagement? were matters &s;o
far advanced, as to make her &s;o openly &s;hew him all
prevailing, all powerful, not only over all rivals, but, ac|cording
to the world's e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;toms upon the&s;e oc|ca&s;ions,
over all decorum?</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently, he &s;aw the Major half kneel; he &s;aw her
ri&s;e to prevent the pro&s;tration; and he heard the dance
called.</P>
<P>He could bear no more; $ain intolerable &s;eized, di&s;|tracted
him, and he abruptly quitted the ball-room, le&s;t
the Major &s;hould approach him with &s;ome happy apo|logy,
which he was unfitted to receive.</P>
<P>He could only &s;ettle his ideas by &s;uppo&s;ing &s;he really
loved Major Cerwood, and had &s;uffered her character
to be infected by the indelicacy that made a part of his
own. Yet why had &s;he &s;o &s;trove to deny all regard, all
connection? what an unaccountable want of frankne&s;s!
what a mi&s;erable dereliction of truth!</P>
<P>His fir&s;t impul&s;e was to &s;et off in&s;tantly from Tun|bridge;
but his &s;econd thoughts repre&s;ented the confe&s;|&s;ion
this would make. He was too proud to leave the
Major, whom he de&s;pi&s;ed, &s;uch a triumph, and too much
hu$t to permit Camilla her&s;elf to know him &s;o poig|nantly
wounded. She could not, indeed, but be &s;truck
by his retreat; he re&s;olved, however, to try to meet with
her the next day, and to &s;peak to her with the amity
they had &s;o lately arranged, yet in a way that &s;hould
manife&s;t him wholly free from all other intere&s;t or view.</P>

<P>ALL plea&s;ure to Camilla was completely over from
the moment that Edgar di&s;appeared</P>
<P>When &s;he returned to Mount Plea&s;ant, Mrs. Arlbery,
whom &s;he found alone, &s;aid, &startq;Did I not under&s;tand
that you were going to dance with Mr. Mandlebert?
How chanced he to leave you? We were kept ages
waiting for the coach; and I &s;aw him pa&s;s by, and walk
off.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, colouring, related the hi&s;tory of the cotil|lon;
and &s;aid, &s;he feared, not knowing how &s;he had been
circum&s;tanced, he was di&s;plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>&startq;Di&s;plea&s;ed'&endq; cried Mrs. Arlbery, laughing; &startq;and
do you, at &s;eventeen, &s;uffer a man to be di&s;plea&s;ed?
How can you do wor&s;e when you are fifty? Know your
own power more truly, and u&s;e it better. Men, my
dear, are all &s;poilt by humility, and all conquered by
gaiety. Amu&s;e and defy them!&mdash;attend to that maxim,
and you will have the world at your feet.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have no &s;uch ambition:&mdash;but I &s;hould be &s;en&s;ibly
hurt to make an old friend think ill of me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;When an old friend,&endq; &s;aid Mrs. Arlbery, archly,
&startq;happens to be a young man, you mu&s;t conduct your|&s;elf
with him a little like what you are; that is, a young
woman. And a young woman is never in her proper
place, if &s;uch &s;ort of old friends are not caught to know
their own. From the in&s;tant you permit them to think
of being offended, they become your ma&s;ters; and you
will find it va&s;tly more convenient to make them your
&s;laves.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla pretended to under&s;tand this in a mere gene|ral
&s;en&s;e, and wi&s;hed her good night.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="161">
The next morning at an early hour, her chamber door
was opened with great &s;uddenne&s;s, and no preparation,
and Mrs. Mittin tript nimbly into the room, with a hat
in her hand.</P>
<P>&startq;Look here! my dear Mi&s;s Tyrold,&endq; cried &s;he, &startq;for
now that other young lady has told me your name, and
I writ it down upon paper, that I might not forget it
again: look at your hat now! Did you ever &s;ee any
thing &s;o much improved for the better? I declare no|body
would know it! Mi&s;s Dennel &s;ays it's as pretty
again as it was at fir&s;t. I ll go and &s;hew it to the other
lady.&endq;</P>
<P>Away &s;he went, triumphant, with the trophy of her
notability; but pre&s;ently returned, &s;aying, &startq;Do, pray,
Mi&s;s Tyrold, write me down that other lady's name upon
a &s;crap of paper. It always goes out of my head. And
one looks as if one knew nobody, when one forgets
people's names.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla complied, and expre&s;&s;ed her &s;hame to have
cau&s;ed her &s;o much trouble.</P>
<P>&startq;O, my dear, it's none at all. I got all the things at
Mrs. Tillden's&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Who is Mrs. Tillden?&endq; cried Camilla, &s;taring.</P>
<P>&startq;Why the milliner.&endq; Don't you know that?</P>
<P>&startq;What things?&endq; a&s;ked Camilla, alarmed.</P>
<P>&startq;Why the&s;e, my dear; don't you &s;ee? Why it's all
new, except ju&s;t the hat it&s;elf, and the feathers.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla was now in extreme embarra&s;&s;ment. She had
concluded Mrs. Mittin had only newly arranged the or|naments,
and had not the &s;malle&s;t idea of incurring a
debt which &s;he had no means to di&s;charge.</P>
<P>&startq;It all comes to quite a trifle,&endq; continued Mrs. Mit|tin,
&startq;for all it's &s;o pretty. Mrs. Tillden's things are
all mon&s;trous cheap. I get things for next to nothing
from her, &s;ometimes, when they are a little pa&s;t the
mode. But then I recommend her a heap of cu&s;|tomers.
I get all my friends, by hook or by crook, to
go to her &s;hop.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="162">
&startq;And what.&endq; &s;tammered out Camilla, &startq;be&s;ides my
thanks, do I owe you?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Oh, nothing. She would not be paid; &s;he &s;aid,
as you was her cu&s;tomer, and had all your things of
her at fir&s;t, &s;he'd put it down in your bill for the &s;ea|&s;on.&endq;</P>
<P>This was, at lea&s;t, &s;ome re&s;pite; though Camilla felt
the di&s;agreeable nece&s;&s;ity of increa&s;ing her intended de|mand
upon Mrs. Arlbery.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Dennel came with a &s;ummons from that lady to
the Pantiles, whither, as the day was fine, &s;he propo&s;ed
they &s;hould walk.</P>
<P>&startq;O,&endq; cried Mrs. Mittin, &startq;if you are going upon
the Pantiles, you mu&s;t go to that &s;hop where there's
the curious ear-rings that are to be raffled for. You'll
put in to be &s;ure.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla &s;aid no, with a &s;igh attributed to the ear|rings,
but due to a tender recollection of the raffle in
which Edgar had procured her the trinket &s;he mo&s;t va|lued.
Mrs. Mittin propo&s;ed accompanying them, and
a&s;ked Camilla to introduce her to Mrs. Arlbery. This
was very di&s;agreeable; but &s;he knew not how, after the
civility &s;he owed her, to refu&s;e.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery received her with much &s;urprize, but
perfect unconcern; con&s;cious of her own importance,
&s;he feared no di&s;grace from being &s;een with one in a
lower &s;tation; and &s;he conceived it no honour to ap|pear
with one in a higher</P>
<P>When they came to the Pantiles, Mrs. Mittin beg|ged
to introduce them to a view of the ear-rings, which
belonged, &s;he &s;aid, to one of her particular friends;
and as Mrs. Arlbery caught the eye of Sir Sedley Cla|rendel
in pa&s;&s;ing the window, &s;he entered the &s;hop.</P>
<P>&startq;Well,&endq; cried Mrs. Mittin, to its ma&s;ter, &startq;don't
&s;ay I bring you no company. I am &s;ure you ought to
let me throw for nothing, if it's only for good luck; for
I am &s;ure the&s;e ladies will all put in. Come&punc; Mi&s;s
Dennel, do lead the way. 'Tis but half a guinea, and
only look what a prize.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;A&s;k papa to pay for me!&endq; cried Mi&s;s Dennel.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="163">
&startq;Come, good &s;ir, come, put down the half guinea
for the young lady. I'm &s;ure you can't refu&s;e her,
Lord! what a half a guinea?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That's a very bad way of rea&s;oning,&endq; an&s;wered Mr.
Dennel; &startq;and what I did not expect from a woman
of your &s;en&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why you don't think, &s;ir, I meant that half a
guinea's a trifle? No indeed&punc; I know what money is
better than that. I only mean half a guinea is nothing
in compari&s;on to ten guineas, which is the price of the
ear-rings; and &s;o that makes me think it's pity the
young lady &s;hould lo&s;e an opportunity of getting them
&s;o cheap. I'm &s;ure if they were dear, I &s;hould be the
la&s;t to recommend them, for I think extravagance the
greate&s;t &s;in under the &s;un&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, now you &s;peak like the &s;en&s;ible woman I took
you for.&endq;</P>
<P>A very little more eloquence of this &s;ort was nece&s;&s;a|ry,
before Mr Dennel put down half a guinea.</P>
<P>&startq;Well,&endq; I declare, cried Mrs. Mittin, &startq;there's only
three more names wanted; and when the&s;e two ladies
have put in, there will be only one! I'm &s;ure if I was
rich enough, that one would not be far off. But come,
ma'am, where's your half guinea? Come, Mi&s;s
Tyrold, don't hold back; who knows but you may
win? there's only nineteen again&s;t you. Lord what's
that?&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla turned away, and Mrs. Arlbery did not
li&s;ten to a word; but when Sir Sedley &s;aid, &startq;They are
really very pretty; won't you throw?&endq; &s;he an&s;wered,
&startq;I mu&s;t rather make a raffle with my own trinkets,
than raffle for other people's. Think of my ponies!
However, I'll put in, if Mr. Dennel will be my pay|ma&s;ter.&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Dennel, turning &s;hort off, walked out of the
&s;hop.</P>
<P>&startq;This is a bad omen!&endq; cried &s;he, laughing; and
then de&s;ired to look at the li&s;t of rafflers; when &s;eeing
among&s;t the names tho&s;e of Lady Alithea Selmore and
the Hon. Mrs. Berlinton, &s;he exclaimed: &startq;'Tis a
coalition of all fa&s;hion and reputation! We &s;hall be ab|&s;olutely
<PB N="163" REF="164">
&s;couted, my dear Mi&s;s Tyrold, if we &s;hrink.
My poor ponies mu&s;t wait half a guinea longer! Let
us put in together.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla an&s;wered, &s;he had no intention to try for
them.</P>
<P>&startq;Well, then, lend me half a guinea; for I never
tru&s;t my&s;elf, now, with my pur&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have not a half guinea&mdash;I have&mdash;I have no&mdash;gold
&mdash;in my pur&s;e,&endq; an&s;wered Camilla, with a face deeply
tinged with red.</P>
<P>Major Cerwood, who joined the party during this
di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, intreated to be banke$ for both the $a$&s;ics.
Camilla po&s;itively refu&s;ed any &s;hare; but $rs. Mittin
&s;aid it would be a &s;hame for &s;uch a young lady to go
without her chance, and wrote do $word$ her name next
to that of Mrs. Arlbery; while the Major, without
further que&s;tion, put down a guinea upon the coun|ter.</P>
<P>Camilla could not endure this; yet from a youthful
&s;hame of confe&s;&s;ing poverty, forced her&s;elf to the ear of
Mrs. Arlbery, and whi&s;pered an intreaty that &s;he would
pay the guinea her&s;elf</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, &s;urprized, an&s;wered &s;he had really
come out without her pur&s;e; but &s;eeing her &s;eriou&s;ly
vexed, added, &startq;If you do not approve of the Major
for a banker till we go home, what &s;ay you to Sir
Sedley?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I &s;hall prefer him a thou&s;and times!&endq;</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, in a low voice, repeated this to the
young Baronet, and receiving his guinea, threw it
down, making the Major, without the &s;malle&s;t excu&s;e
or ceremony, take back his own.</P>
<P>This was by no means lo&s;t upon Sir Sedley; he
felt flattered&mdash;he felt &s;oftened; he thought Camilla
looked unu&s;ually lovely; he began to wonder at the
coldne&s;s of Mandlebert, and to lament that the fir&s;t
affections of &s;o fair a creature &s;hould be ca&s;t away.</P>
<P>Mandlebert him&s;elf was an object of nothing le&s;s
than envy. He had entered the &s;hop during the con|te&s;t
about the $affle, and &s;een Major Cerwood pay for
Camilla as well as for Mrs. Arlbery. Confirmed in
<PB N="164" REF="165">
his notions of her po&s;itive engagement, and &s;ick at
heart from the confirmation, he walked further into the
&s;hop, upon pretence of looking at &s;ome other articles,
before he could a&s;&s;ume &s;ufficient compo&s;ure to &s;peak to
her.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mittin now began woefully to repine that &s;he
could not take the la&s;t &s;hare for the ear-rings; and ad|dre&s;&s;ing
her&s;elf to Mr. Dennel, who re-entered as &s;oon
as he &s;aw the money was paid for Mrs. Arlbery, &s;he
&s;aid, &startq;You &s;ee, &s;ir, if there was &s;omebody ready to
take the la&s;t chance at once, this gentleman might
fix a day for the throwing immediately; but el&s;e, it may
be dawdled on, nobody knows how long; for one will
be gone, and t'other will be gone, and there'll be no
getting the people together; and all the plea&s;ure of the
thing is being here to throw for one's &s;elf: for I don't
much like tru&s;ting money matters out of &s;ight.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If I'd thought of all that,&endq; &s;aid Mr. Dennel, &startq;I
&s;hould not have put in.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;True, &s;ir&punc; But here, if it was not that I don't
happen to have half a guinea to &s;pare ju&s;t now, how
nicely it might all be fini&s;hed in a trice! For, as I
have been &s;aying to Mi&s;s Dennel, this may turn out
a real bargain; for they'll fetch their full value at any
time. And I tell Mi&s;s Dennel that's the only way to
lay out money, upon things that will bring it back again
if it's wanted; not upon frippery froppery, that's &s;poilt
in a minute, and then i'n't worth a farthing.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Very &s;en&s;ibly &s;aid,&endq; cried Mr Dennel; &startq;I'm
&s;ure &s;he can't hear better advice; I'm much obliged to
you for putting &s;uch &s;en&s;ible thoughts into her head.&endq;
And then, hoping &s;he would continue her good le&s;&s;ons
to his daughter, he drew out his pur&s;e, and begged her
to accept a chance from it for the prize.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mittin was in raptures; and the following week
was &s;ettled for the raffle.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, who had attended to this &s;cene with
much amu&s;ement, now &s;aid to General Kin&s;ale, who
had taken a &s;eat by her: &startq;Did I not tell you well,
General, that all men are at the di&s;po&s;ition of women?
If even the &s;hrewd monied man cannot re&s;i&s;t, what
<PB N="165" REF="166">
heart &s;hall we find impenetrable? The connoi&s;&s;eur in
human characters knows, that the pur&s;uit of wealth is
the petrifaction of tenderne&s;s: yet yonder is my good
brother-in-law, who thinks ca&s;h and exi&s;tence one,
allured even to &s;quander money, merely by the addre&s;s
of that woman, in allowing that money &s;hould be the
fir&s;t &s;tudy of life! Let even Clarendel have a care of
him&s;elf, or, when lea&s;t he &s;u&s;pects any danger, &s;ome
fair dairy-maid will prai&s;e his hor&s;eman&s;hip, or take a
fancy to his favourite &s;paniel, or any other favourite that
happens to be the foible of the day, and his invulnera|bility
will be at her feet, and, Lady Clarendel be
brought forward in a fortnight.&endq;</P>
<P>Lord O'Lerney now entered the &s;hop, accompanying
a lady who&s;e countenance and appearance were &s;ingu|larly
plea&s;ing, and who, having made &s;ome purcha&s;e,
was quietly retiring, when the ma&s;ter of the &s;hop in|quired
if &s;he wi&s;hed to look at the ear-rings; adding,
that though the number was full, he knew of one per&s;on,
who would give up her chance, in ca&s;e it would oblige
a cu&s;tomer.</P>
<P>She an&s;wered &s;he had no pre&s;ent occa&s;ion for ear-rings,
and would not therefore take up either his time or her
own unnece&s;&s;arily; and then walked gently away, &s;till
attended by Lord O'Lerney.</P>
<P>&startq;Ble&s;s me.&endq; cried Mrs. Arlbery, &startq;who is that? to
hear a little plain common &s;en&s;e is &s;o rare, it &s;trikes one
more than wit.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It's Lady I&s;abella Irby, madam,&endq; an&s;wered the ma&s;|ter
of the &s;hop.</P>
<P>Here Lord O'Lerney, who had only handed her to
her carriage, returned.</P>
<P>&startq;My Lord,&endq; &startq;cried Mrs. Arlbery,&endq; &startq;do you know
what a curio&s;ity you brought in among&s;t us ju&s;t now?&endq;
$word$ woman of rank who looks round upon other peo|ple
ju&s;t as if &s;he thought they were her fellow crea|tures?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Fie, fie!&endq; an&s;wered Lord O'Lerney, laughing,
&startq;why will you &s;uppo&s;e that &s;o rare? If we have not
as many women who are amiable with titles as without,
it is only becau&s;e we have not the &s;ame number from
<PB N="166" REF="167">
which to &s;elect them. They are &s;poilt or un&s;poilt, but
in the &s;ame proportion as the re&s;t of their &s;ex. Their
fall, or their e&s;cape, is le&s;s local than you imagine; it
does not depend upon their titles, but upon their under|&s;tandings.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, my Lord, I believe you are right. I was
adopting a narrow prejudice, merely from indolence of
thought.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But why, my lord,&endq; cried Sir Sedley, &startq;does this pa|ragon
of a divinity deny her example to the world? Is
it in contempt of our incorrigibility? or in horror of our
contagion?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My dear Sir Sedley,&endq; &s;aid Mrs. Arlbery, `don't
flatter your&s;elf with being &s;o dangerous. Her lady&s;hip
does not fly you from fear, take my word for it. There
is nothing in her air that looks as if &s;he could only be
good by being &s;hut up. I dare believe &s;he could meet
you every day yet be mi&s;tre&s;s of her&s;elf? Neverthe|le&s;s,
why, my lord, is &s;he &s;uch a reclu&s;e? Why does
one never &s;ee her at the rooms?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Never &s;ee her there, my dear madam! &s;he is there
almo&s;t every night; only being unintruding, &s;he is un|noticed.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The &s;atire, then, my lord,&endq; &s;aid Mrs. Arlbery,
&startq;falls upon the company. Why is &s;he not &s;urrounded
by volunteer admirers? Why, with a per&s;on and man|ner
&s;o formed to charm, joined to &s;uch a character, and
&s;uch rank, has &s;he not her train?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The rea&s;on, my dear madam, you could define
with more &s;agacity than my&s;elf; &s;he mu&s;t be &s;ought! And
the world is &s;o lazy, that the mo&s;t ea&s;y of acce&s;s, how|ever
valuele&s;s, is preferred to the mo&s;t perfect, who mu&s;t
be pur&s;ued with any trouble.&endq;</P>
<P>Admirable Lord O'Lerney! thought Edgar, what a
le&s;&s;on is this to youthful females again&s;t the glare of
public homage, the fal&s;e brilliancy of unfeminine popu|larity?</P>
<P>This conver&s;ation, however, which alone of any
he had heard at Tunbridge promi&s;ed him any plea&s;ure,
was interrupted by Mr. Dennel, who &s;aid the dinner
would be &s;poilt, if they did not all go home.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="168">
Camilla felt extremely vexed to quit the &s;hop, with|out
clearing up the hi&s;tory of the dance; and Edgar,
&s;eeing the per&s;evering Major at her &s;ide as &s;he departed,
in urgency to put any &s;pecies of period to his own &s;uf|ferings,
followed the party, and precipitately began a di&s;|cour&s;e
with Lord O'Lerney upon making the tour of
Europe. Camilla, for whom it was de&s;igned, in|tent
upon planning her own defence, heard nothing
that was &s;aid, till Lord O Lerney a&s;ked him if his route
would be through Switzerland, and he an&s;wered: &startq;My
route is not quite fixed, my lord.&endq;</P>
<P>Startled, &s;he now li&s;tened, and Mrs. Arlbery, whom
&s;he held by the arm, was equally &s;urpri&s;ed, and looked
to &s;ee how &s;he bore this intimation.</P>
<P>&startq;If you will walk with me to my lodgings,&endq; replied
Lord O'Lerney, &startq;I will &s;hew you my own route, which
may perhaps &s;ave you &s;ome difficulties. Shall you &s;et
out &s;oon?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I fancy within a month,&endq; an&s;wered Edgar;
and, arm in arm, they walked away together, as Ca|milla
and her party quitted the Pantiles for Mount
Plea&s;ant.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Coun&s;els for Conque&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>FORTUNATELY for Camilla, no eye was upon
her at this period but that of Mrs Arlbery; her changed
countenance, el&s;e, mu&s;t have betrayed &s;till more wide|ly
her emotion. Mrs. Arlbery &s;aw it with real concern,
and &s;aying &s;he had &s;omething to con&s;ult her about, hur|ried
on with her alone.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="169">
Camilla &s;carce knew what &s;he did, or what &s;he &s;uf|fered;
the &s;uddenne&s;s of &s;urpri&s;e, which involved &s;o
&s;evere a di&s;appointment, almo&s;t &s;tupified her faculties.
Mrs. Arlbery did not utter one word by the way, and,
when they arrived at home, &s;aw her to her chamber,
pre&s;&s;ed her hand, and left her.</P>
<P>She now from a &s;en&s;e of &s;hame, came to her full re|collection.
She was convinced all her feelings were
under&s;tood by Mrs. Arlbery; &s;he thought over what her
father had &s;aid upon &s;uch expo&s;ures, and hopele&s;s of
any honorable end to her &s;u&s;pences, earne&s;tly wi&s;hed
her&s;elf back at Etherington, to hide in his revered brea&s;t
her confu&s;ion and grief.</P>
<P>Even Mrs. Arlbery &s;he now believed had been mi&s;|taken;
Edgar appeared never to have loved her; his
attentions, his kinde&s;s, had all flowed from friend&s;hip;
his &s;olicitude, his coun&s;el had been the re&s;ult of family
regard.</P>
<P>When called to dinner, &s;he de&s;cended with downca&s;t
eyes. She found no company invited; &s;he felt thankful,
yet aba&s;hed; and Mrs. Arlbery let her retire when the
meal was over, but &s;oon followed to beg &s;he would pre|pare
for the play.</P>
<P>She &s;aw her ha&s;tily putting away her handherchief,
and di&s;per&s;ing her tears. &startq;Ah! my dear,&endq; cried &s;he,
taking her hand, &startq;I am afraid this old friend of yours
does not much contribute to make Tunbridge Wells
&s;alubrious to you!&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, affecting not to under&s;tand her, &s;aid &s;he
had never been in better health.</P>
<P>&startq;Of mind, do you mean, or body?&endq; cried Mrs.
Arlbery, laughing; but &s;eeing &s;he only redoubled her
di&s;tre&s;s, more &s;eriou&s;ly added, &startq;Will you &s;uffer me, my
dear Mi&s;s Tyrold, to play the old friend, al&s;o, and &s;peak
to you with openne&s;s?&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla dur&s;t not &s;ay no, though &s;he feared to &s;ay
yes.</P>
<P>&startq;I mu&s;t content my&s;elf with a tacit compliance, if
I can obtain no other. I am really unea&s;y to talk with
you; not, believe me, from officiou&s;ne&s;s nor imperti|nence,
but from a per&s;ua&s;ion I may be able to promote
<PB N="169" REF="170">
your happine&s;s. You won't &s;peak, I &s;ee? And you
judge perfectly right; for the le&s;s you di&s;claim, the le&s;s
I &s;hall torment you. Permit me, therefore, to take for
granted that you are already aware I am acquainted
with the &s;tate of your heart.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, trembling, had now no wi&s;h but to fly; &s;he
fa&s;tened her eyes upon the door, and every thought
was devoted to find the means of her e&s;cape.</P>
<P>&startq;Nay, nay, if you look frightened in &s;ober &s;adne&s;s,
I am gone. But &s;hall I think le&s;s, or know le&s;s, for
&s;aying nothing? It is not &s;peech, my dear Mi&s;s Ty|rold,
that makes detections: It only proclaims them.&endq;</P>
<P>A &s;igh was all the an&s;wer of Camilla: though, a&s;|&s;ured,
thus, &s;he had nothing to gain by &s;light, &s;he
forced her&s;elf to &s;tay.</P>
<P>&startq;We under&s;tand one another, I &s;ee, perfectly. Let
me now, then, as unaffectedly go on, as if the grand
explanation had been verbally made. That your fancy,
my fair young friend, has hit upon a tormentor, I will
not deny; yet not upon an ingrate; for this per&s;on,
little as you &s;eem con&s;cious of your power, certainly
loves you.&endq;</P>
<P>Surpri&s;ed off all &s;ort of guard, Camilla exclaimed,
&startq;O no!&mdash;O no!&endq;</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery &s;miled, but went on. &startq;Yes, my
dear, he undoubtedly does you that little ju&s;tice; yet,
if you are not well advi&s;ed his pa&s;&s;ion will be unavail|ing;
and your artle&s;&s;ne&s;s, your facility, and your in|nocence,
with his knowledge, nay, his very admirati|on
of them, will operate but to &s;eparate you.&endq;</P>
<P>Glowing with oppo&s;ing yet &s;trong emotions at the&s;e
words, the countenance of Camilla a&s;ked an explana|tion,
in defiance of her earne&s;t de&s;ire to look indiffer|ent
or angry.</P>
<P>&startq;You will wonder, and very naturally, how &s;uch
attractions &s;hould work as repul&s;es; but I will be plain
and clear, and you mu&s;t be candid and rational, and
forgive me. The&s;e attractions, my dear, will be the
&s;ource of this mi&s;chief, becau&s;e he &s;ees, by their means,
that you are undoubtedly at his command.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="171">
&startq;No, madam! no Mrs. Arlbery!&endq; cried Camilla,
in who&s;e pride now every other feeling was concen|trated,
&startq;he does not, cannot &s;ee it!&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I would not hurt you for the world, my very
amiable young friend; but pardon me if I &s;ay, that not
to &s;ee it&mdash;he mu&s;t be blinder than I imagine him!&mdash;
blinder than&mdash;to tell you the truth, I am much in|clined
to think any of his race.&endq;</P>
<P>Confounded, irritated, and wounded, Camilla re|mained
a moment &s;ilent, and then, though &s;carce arti|culately,
an&s;wered: &startq;If &s;uch is your opinion&mdash;at lea&s;t
he &s;hall &s;ee it&mdash;fancy it. I mean&mdash;no more!&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Keep to that re&s;olution, and you will behold him
&mdash;where he ought to be&mdash;at your feet.&endq;</P>
<P>Irre&s;i&s;tibly, though mo&s;t unwillingly appea&s;ed by
this unexpected conclu&s;ion, &s;he turned away to hide a
blu&s;h in which anger had not &s;olely a place, and &s;uffered
Mrs. Arlbery to go on.</P>
<P>&startq;There is but one &s;ingle method to make a man of
his ruminating cla&s;s know his own mind: give him
cau&s;e to fear he will lo&s;e you. Animate, in&s;pirit, in|&s;pire
him with doubt.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But why, ma'am,&endq; cried Camilla, in a faultering
voice; why &s;hall you &s;uppo&s;e I will take any method
at all?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The apprehen&s;ion you will take none is the very
motive that urges me to &s;peak to you. You are young
enough in the world to think men come of them$elves.
But you are mi&s;taken, my dear. That happens rare|ly;
except with inflamed and hot-headed boys, who&s;e
pa&s;&s;ions are in their fir&s;t innocence as well as violence.
Mandlebert has already given the dominion of his to
other rulers, who will take more care of his pride,
though not of his happine&s;s. Attend to one who has
travelled further into life than your&s;elf, and believe me
when I a&s;&s;ert, that his bane, and yours alike is his &s;e|curity.&endq;</P>
<P>With a colour yet deeper than ever Camilla re&s;ent|fully
repeated &startq;Security!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Nay, how can he doubt? with a &s;ituation in life
&s;uch as his&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="172">
&startq;Situation in life! Do you think he can ever &s;up|po&s;e
that would have the lea&s;t, the mo&s;t minute weight
with me?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, it would be a very &s;hocking &s;uppo&s;ition, I
allow! but yet, &s;ome how or other, that &s;ame fordid
thing called money, does manage to produce &s;uch abun|dance
of little comforts and pretty amu&s;ements, that
one is apt&mdash;to half &s;u&s;pect&mdash;it may really not much
add to any matrimonial aver&s;ion.&endq;</P>
<P>The very idea of &s;uch a &s;u&s;picion offended Camilla
beyond all el&s;e that had pa&s;&s;ed; Mrs. Arlbery appear|ed
to her indelicate, unkind, and ungenerous, and re|gretting
&s;he had ever &s;een, and repenting &s;he had ever
known her, &s;he &s;unk upon a chair in a pa&s;&s;ionate bur&s;t
of tears.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery embraced her, begged her pardon a
thou&s;and times; a&s;&s;ured her all &s;he had uttered was the
effect of e&s;teem as well as of affection, &s;ince &s;he &s;aw
her too delicate, and too inexperienced, to be aware
either of the dangers or the advantages &s;urrounding
her; and that very far from meaning to hurt her, &s;he
had few things more at heart than the de&s;ire of prov|ing
the &s;incerity of her regard, and endeavouring to
contribute to her happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Camilla thanked her, dried her eyes, and &s;trove to
appear compo&s;ed; but &s;he was too deeply affected for
internal con&s;olation: &s;he felt her&s;elf degraded in being
openly addre&s;&s;ed as a love-&s;ick girl; and injured in be|ing
&s;uppo&s;ed, for a moment, capable of any merce|nary
view. She de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed going out, and
to have the evening to her&s;elf; not on account of the
expence of the play; &s;he had again wholly forgotten her
poverty; but to breathe a little alone, and in dulge
the &s;adne&s;s of her mind.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, unfeignedly &s;orry to have cau&s;ed her
any pain, would not oppo&s;e her inclination; &s;he repeat|ed
her apologies, dragged from her an a&s;&s;urance of for|givene&s;s,
and went down &s;tairs alone to a &s;ummons from
Sir Sedley Clarendel.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t moments of her departure were &s;pent by
Camilla in the deepe&s;t dejection; from which, however,
<PB N="172" REF="173">
the recollection of her father, and her &s;olemn engage|ment
to him, &s;oon after awakened her. She read again
his injunctions, and re&s;olving not to add to her unhap|pine&s;s
by any failure in her duty, determined to make
her appearance with &s;ome &s;pirit before Mrs. Arlbery &s;et
out.</P>
<P>&startq;My dear Clarendel,&endq; cried that lady, as &s;he en|tered
the parlour, &startq;this poor little girl is in a more
&s;erious plight than I had conjectured. I have been
giving her a few hints, from the &s;tores of my worldly
knowledge, and they appear to her &s;o dete&s;tably mean
and vulgar, that they have almo&s;t broken her heart.
The arrival of this odious Mandlebert has overthrown
all our &s;chemes. We are cut up, Sir Sedley! com|pletely
cut up!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, indubitably to a degree!&endq; cried the Baronet,
with an air of mingled pique and conceit; &startq;how
could it be otherwi&s;e? Exi&s;ts the wight who could
dream of competition with Mandlebert!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Nay, now, my dear Clarendel, you enchant me.
If you view his power with re&s;entment, you are the man
in the world to crumble it to the du&s;t. To work,
therefore, dear creature, without delay.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But how mu&s;t I go about it? a little in&s;truction,
for pity!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Charming innocent! So you don't know how to
try to make your&s;elf agreeable?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Not in the lea&s;t! I am ignorant to a redundance.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And were you never more adroit?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Never. A goth in grain! Witle&s;s from the fir&s;t
<HI>muling in my nur&s;e's arms!</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Come, come, a truce for a moment, with foppery,
and an&s;wer me &s;eriou&s;ly; Were you ever in love, Cla|rendel?
&s;peak the truth. I am ju&s;t &s;eized with a pa&s;|&s;ionate
de&s;ire to know.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why&mdash;yes&mdash;&endq; an&s;wered he, pulling his lips with
his fingers, &startq;I think,&mdash;I rather think&mdash;I was once.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O tell! tell! tell!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="174">
&startq;Nay, I am not very po&s;itive. One hears it is to
happen; and one is put upon thinking of it, while &s;o
very young, that one &s;oon takes it for granted. De|fine
it a little, and I can an&s;wer you more accurately.
Pray, is it any thing beyond being very fond, and
very &s;illy, with a little touch of melancholy?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Preci&s;e! preci&s;e! Tell me, therefore, what it
was that caught you. Beauty? Fortune? Flattery?
or Wit? Speak! &s;peak! I die to know!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, I have forgotten all that the&s;e hundred years!
I have not the &s;malle&s;t trace left!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You are a terrible coxcomb, my dear Clarendel!
and I am a wor&s;e my&s;elf for giving you &s;o much encou|ragement.
But, however, we mu&s;t ab&s;olutely do &s;ome|thing
for this fair and dropping violet. She won't go
even to the play to-night.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Lovely lilly! how &s;hall we rear it? Tell her I beg
her to be of our party.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You beg her? My dear Sir Sedley! what do you
talk of?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Tell her 'tis my intreaty, my &s;upplication!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And you think that will make her comply?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You will &s;ee.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Bravo, my dear Clarendel, bravo! However, if
you have the courage to &s;end &s;uch a me&s;&s;age, I have not
to deliver it: but I will write it for you.&endq;</P>
<P>She then wrote,</P>
<P>&startq;Sir Sedley Clarendel a&s;&s;erts, that if you are not
as inexorable as you are fair, you will not refu&s;e to
join our little party to night at the theatre.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, after a &s;evere conflict from this note, which
&s;he concluded to be the mere work of Mrs. Arlbery
to draw her from retirement, &s;ent word &s;he would wait
upon her.</P>
<P>Sir Sedley heard the an&s;wer with exultation, and
Mrs. Arlbery with &s;urpri&s;e. She declared, however,
that &s;ince he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed this power, &s;he &s;hould not &s;uffer
it to lie dormant, but make it work upon her fair friend,
till it either excited jealou&s;y in Mandlebert, or brought
indifference to her&s;elf. &startq;My re&s;olution,&endq; cried &s;he,
<PB N="174" REF="175">
&startq;is fixt; either to &s;ee him at her feet, or drive him
from her heart.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, pre&s;ently de&s;cending, looked away from
Mrs. Arlbery; but, un&s;u&s;picious as &s;he was unde&s;ign|ing,
thanked the Baronet for his me&s;&s;age, and told him
&s;he had already repented her &s;olitary plan. The Ba|ronet
felt but the more flattered, from &s;uppo&s;ing this
was &s;aid from the fear of flattering him.</P>
<P>In the way to the theatre, Camilla, with much con|fu&s;ion,
recollected her empty pur&s;e; but could not, be|fore
Mr. and Mi&s;s Dennel and Sir Sedley, prevail with
her&s;elf to make it known; &s;he could only determine
to a&s;k Mrs. Arlbery to pay for her at pre&s;ent, and de|fer
the explanation till night.</P>
<P>But, ju&s;t as &s;he alighted from the coach, Mrs. Arl|bery,
in her u&s;ual manner, &s;aid: &startq;Do pay for me,
good Dennel; you know how I hate money.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, hurrying after her, whi&s;pered, &startq;May I
beg you to lend me &s;ome &s;ilver?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Silver! I have not carried any about with me &s;ince
I lo&s;t my dear ponies and my pet phaeton. I am as
poor as Job; and therefore bent upon avoiding all temp|tation.
Somebody or other always tru&s;ts me. If they
get paid, they ble&s;s their &s;tars. If not,&mdash;do your hear
me, Mr. Dennel?&mdash;'twill be all the &s;ame an hundred
years hence; &s;o what man of any &s;pirit will think of it?
hey, Mr. Dennel?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But&mdash;dear madam!&mdash;pray&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, they'll change for you, here, my dear, with|out
difficulty.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But&mdash;but&mdash;pray &s;top!&mdash;I&mdash;I have no gold nei|ther!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Have you done like me, then, come out without
your pur&s;e?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No!&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>This &s;ingle negative, and the fluttered manner, and
low voice in which it was pronounced, gave Mrs. Arl|bery
the utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment. She &s;aid nothing, how|ever,
but called aloud to Mr. Dennel to &s;ettle for the
whole party.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="176">
Mr. Dennel, during the dialogue, had paid for him|&s;elf
and his daughter, and walked on into the box.</P>
<P>&startq;What a Hottentot!&endq; exclaimed Mrs. Arlbery.
&startq;Come, then, Clarendel, take pity on two poor di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed
objects, and let us pa&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P>Sir Sedley, little &s;u&s;picious of the truth, yet flattered
to be always called upon to be the banker of Camilla,
obeyed with alacrity.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery placed Camilla upon a &s;eat before her,
and motioned to the Baronet to remain in a row above;
and then, in a low voice, &s;aid: &startq;My dear Clarendel,
do you know they have let that poor girl come to Tun|bridge
without a &s;ixpence in her pocket!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Is it po&s;&s;ible?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;'Tis a fact. I never &s;u&s;pected it till &s;u&s;picion
was followed by confirmation. She had a guinea or
two, I fancy, at fir&s;t, ju&s;t to equip her with one &s;et of
things to appear in; which, probably, the good Par&s;on
imagined would la&s;t as clean and as long at a public
place as at his par&s;onage-hou&s;e, where my be&s;t &s;uit is
worn about twice in a &s;ummer. But how that rich old
uncle of hers could &s;uffer her to come without a penny,
I can neither account for nor forgive. I have &s;een her
&s;hyne&s;s about money-matters for &s;ome days pa&s;t; but I
&s;o little conjectured the po&s;&s;ibility of her di&s;tre&s;s, that I
have always rather increa&s;ed than &s;pared it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Sweet little angel!&endq; exclaimed the Baronet, in a
tone of tenderne&s;s; &startq;I had indeed no idea of her &s;itu|ation.
Heavens! I could lay half my fortune at her

<P>&startq;Half, my dear Clarendel!&endq; cried Mrs. Arlbery,
laughing; &startq;nay, why not the whole? where will you
find a more lovely companion?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Pho, pho!&mdash;but why &s;hould it be &s;o va&s;tly horrid
an incongruity that a man who, by chance, is rich,
&s;hould do &s;omething for a woman who, by chance, is
poor? How immen&s;ely impertinent is the prejudice that
forbids &s;o natural a u&s;e of money! why &s;hould the bet|ter
half of a man's actions be always under the domi|nion
of &s;ome pre&s;criptive &s;lavery? 'Tis hideous to think
of. And how could he more delectably &s;pend, or more
<PB N="176" REF="177">
extatically enjoy his fortune, than by &s;o equitable a par|ticipation?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;True, Sir Sedley. And you men are all &s;o di&s;in|tere&s;ted,
&s;o pure in your benevolence, &s;o free from any
&s;pirit of encroachment, that no po&s;&s;ible ill con&s;equence
could en&s;ue from &s;uch an arrangement. When once a
fair lady had made you a civil courte&s;y, you would whol|ly
forget you had ever obliged her. And you would
let her walk her ways and forget it al&s;o: e&s;pecially if,
by chance, &s;he happened to be young and pretty.&endq;</P>
<P>This raillery was interrupted by the appearance of
Edgar in an oppo&s;ite box. &startq;Ah!&endq; cried Mrs. Arlbe|ry,
&startq;look but at that piece of congelation that nothing
&s;eems to thaw! Enter the li&s;ts again&s;t him, dear Cla|rendel!
He has &s;tationed him&s;elf there merely to watch
and di&s;countenance her. I hate him heartily; yet he
rolls in wealth, and &s;he has nothing. I mu&s;t bring
them, therefore, together, po&s;itively: for though a
hu&s;band&mdash;&s;uch a fa&s;tidious one e&s;pecially&mdash;is not what
I would recommend to her for happine&s;s, 'tis better
than poverty. And, after his cold and &s;elfi&s;h manner,
I am convinced he loves her. He is evidently in pur|&s;uit
of her, though he wants genero&s;ity to act openly.
Work him but with a little jealou&s;y, and you will find
me right.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Me, my dear madam? me, my divine Mrs. Arlbery?
Alas! with what chance? No! &s;ee where enters the
gallant Major. Thence mu&s;t i&s;&s;ue tho&s;e poignant darts
that newly vivify the expiring embers of langui&s;hing
love.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Now don't talk &s;uch non&s;en&s;e when I am really
&s;erious. You are the very man for the purpo&s;e: be|cau&s;e,
though you have no feeling, Mandlebert does
not know you are without it. But tho&s;e Officers are too
notoriou&s;ly unmeaning to excite a moment's real appre|hen&s;ion.
They have a new dulcinea wherever they
newly quarter, and carry about the few ideas they po&s;|&s;e&s;s
from dam&s;el to dam&s;el, as regularly as from town
to town.&endq;</P>
<P>The Major was now in the box, and the conver&s;ation
ended.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="178">
He endeavoured, as u&s;ual, to monopolize Camilla;
but while her thoughts were all upon Edgar, the whole
&s;he could command of her attention was be&s;towed upon
Sir Sedley.</P>
<P>This was not unob&s;erved by Edgar, who now again
wavered in believing &s;he loved the Major: but the doubt
brought with it no plea&s;ure; it led him only the more
to contemn her. Does &s;he turn, thought he, thus,
from one to the other, with no preference but of acci|dent
or caprice? Is her favour thus light of circulati|on?
Is it now the mawki&s;h Major, and now the cox|comb
Clarendel? Already is &s;he thus ver&s;ed in the com|mon
di&s;&s;ipation of conquetry?&mdash;O, if &s;o, how ble&s;t has
been my e&s;cape! A coquette wife!&mdash;</P>
<P>His heart &s;welled, and his eye no longer &s;ought
her.</P>
<P>At night, as &s;oon as &s;he went to her own room, Mrs.
Arlbery followed her, and &s;aid: &startq;My dear Mi&s;s Ty|rold,
I know much better than you how many &s;ix-pences
and three-pences are perpetually wanted at places &s;uch
as the&s;e. Do &s;uffer me to be your banker. What &s;hall
we begin our account with?&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla felt really thankful for being &s;pared an open|ing
upon this &s;ubject: She con&s;ented to borrow two
guineas; but Mrs. Arlbery would not leave her with
le&s;s than five, adding, &startq;I in&s;i&s;t upon doubling it in a
day or two. Never mind what I &s;ay about my di&s;tre&s;s,
and my phaeton, and my ponies; 'tis only to torment
Dennel, who trembles at parting with half-a-crown for
half an hour; or el&s;e, now and then, to &s;et other peo|ple
a &s;taring; which is not unamu&s;ing, when nothing
el&s;e is going forward. But believe me, my dear young
friend, were I really in di&s;tre&s;s, or were I really not to
di&s;charge the&s;e petty debts I incur, you would &s;oon di&s;|cover
it by the thinne&s;s of our parties! The&s;e men that
now &s;o flock around us, would find &s;ome other load|&s;tone.
I know them pretty well, dear creatures!&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>Though &s;hocked to appear thus de&s;titute, Camilla
was &s;omewhat relieved to have no debt but with Mrs.
<PB N="178" REF="179">
Arlbery; for &s;he re&s;olved to pay Sir Sedley and the
milliner the next day, and to &s;ettle with Mrs. Arlbery
upon her return to Etherington.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XX.</HEAD>

<P>THE next day was appointed for the ma&s;ter of the
ceremonies' ball; which proved a general rendezvous
of all parties, and almo&s;t all cla&s;&s;es of company.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mittin, in a morning vi&s;it to Camilla, found
out that &s;he had only the &s;ame cap for this occa&s;ion that
&s;he had worn upon every other; and, a&s;&s;uring her it
was grown &s;o old-fa&s;hioned, that not a lady's maid in
Tunbridge would now be &s;een in it, &s;he offered to pin
her up a turban, which &s;hould come to next to nothing,
yet &s;hould be the prettie&s;t, and &s;imple&s;t, and cheape&s;t
thing that ever was &s;een.</P>
<P>Camilla, though a &s;tranger to vanity, and without
any natural turn to extravagance&punc; was neither of an age,
nor a philo&s;ophy, to be unmoved by the apprehen&s;ion of
being expo&s;ed to ridicule from her dre&s;s: &s;he thankful|ly,
therefore, accepted the propo&s;al; and Mrs. Mittin,
taking a guinea, &s;aid, &s;he would pay Mrs. Tillden for
the hat, at the &s;ame time that &s;he bought a new hand|kerchief
for the turban.</P>
<P>When &s;he came back, however, &s;he had only laid out
a few &s;hillings at another &s;hop, for &s;ome articles, &s;o
cheap, &s;he &s;aid it would have been a &s;hame not to buy
them; but without paying the bill, Mrs. Tillden having
de&s;ired it might not be di&s;charged till the young lady
was leaving the Wells.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="180">
As the turban was made up from a pattern of one
prepared for Mrs. Berlinton, Camilla had every rea&s;on
to be &s;atisfied of its elegance. Nor did Mrs. Mittin in|volve
her in much di&s;tre&s;s how her own trouble might
be recompen&s;ed; the cap &s;he found unfit for Camilla,
&s;he could contrive, &s;he &s;aid, to alter for her&s;elf; and as
a friend had given her a ticket for the ball, it would be
mighty convenient to her, as &s;he had nothing of the kind
ready.</P>
<P>Far different were the &s;en&s;ations with which Edgar
and Camilla &s;aw each other this night, from tho&s;e with
which, &s;o lately they had met in the &s;ame apartment.
Edgar thought her degenerating into the character of a
conquette, and Camilla, in his intended tour, anticipat|ed
a period to all their intercour&s;e.</P>
<P>She was received, meanwhile, in general, with pe|culiar
and flattering attention. Sir Sedley Clarendel
made up to her, with public &s;miles and courte&s;y; even
Lord Newford and Sir Theophilus Jarard, though they
pa&s;&s;ed by Mrs. Arlbery without &s;peaking to her, &s;ingled
out Camilla for their devoirs. The di&s;tinction paid her
by the admired Mrs. Berlinton had now not only
marked her as an object whom it would not be deroga|tory
to treat with civility, but as one who might, hence|forward,
be regarded her&s;elf as admitted into <HI>certain
circles.</HI></P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, though every way a woman of fa&s;hion,
they conceived to be &s;omewhat wanting in <HI>ton,</HI> &s;ince &s;he
pre&s;ided in no party, was unnoticed by Lady Alithea
Selmore, and unknown to Mrs Berlinton.</P>
<P><HI>Ton,</HI> in the &s;cale of connoi&s;&s;eurs in the <HI>certain cir|cles,</HI>
is as much above fa&s;hion, as fa&s;hion is above for|tune:
for though the latter is an ingredient that all alike
covet to po&s;&s;e&s;s, it is courted without being re&s;pected,
and de&s;ired without being honoured, except only by
tho&s;e who, from earlie&s;t life, have been taught to earn
it as a bu&s;ine&s;s. <HI>Ton,</HI> meanwhile, is as attainable with|out
birth as without under&s;tanding, though in all the
<HI>certain circles</HI> it takes place of either. To define what
<PB N="180" REF="181">
it is, would be as difficult to the mo&s;t renowned of its
votaries, as to an utter &s;tranger to its attributes. That
tho&s;e who call them&s;elves of the <HI>ton</HI> either lead, or hold
cheap all others, is obtru&s;ively evident: but how and by
what art they attain &s;uch pre-eminence, they would be
perplexed to explain. That &s;ome whim has happily
called forth imitators; that &s;ome &s;trange phra&s;e has been
adopted; that &s;omething odd in dre&s;s has become popu|lar;
that &s;ome beauty, or &s;ome deformity, no matter
which, has found annotators; may commonly be traced
as the origin of their fir&s;t public notice. But to which|ever
of the&s;e accidents their early fame may be attri|buted,
its e&s;tabli&s;hment and its glory is built upon vani|ty
that knows no deficiency, or in&s;olence that knows no
blu&s;h.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding her high &s;uperiority both in capacity
and knowledge, Mrs. Arlbery felt piqued by this beha|viour,
though &s;he laughed at her&s;elf for heeding it.
&startq;Neverthele&s;s,&endq; cried &s;he, &startq;tho&s;e who &s;hew con|tempt,
even though them&s;elves are the mo&s;t contempti|ble,
always &s;eem on the higher ground. Yet 'tis only,
with regard to the&s;e animals of the <HI>ton,</HI> that nobody
combats them. Their pre&s;umption is &s;o notorious, that,
either by di&s;gu&s;t or alarm, it keeps off reprehen&s;ion.
Let any one boldly, and face to face, venture to be
more uncivil than them&s;elves, and they would be over|powered
at once. Their valour is no better than that
of a barking cur, who affrights all that go on without
looking at him, but who, the moment he is turned up|on
with a &s;tamp and a fierce look, retreats him&s;elf,
amazed, afraid, and a&s;hamed.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If you, Mrs. Arlbery,&endq; &s;aid the General, &startq;would
undertake to tutor them, what good you might do!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, Heavens, General, &s;u&s;pect me not of &s;uch re|forming
Quixoti&s;m! I have not the &s;malle&s;t de&s;ire to do
them any good, believe me! If nature has given them
no &s;en&s;e of propriety, why &s;hould I be more liberal? I
only want to puni&s;h them; and that not, alas! from
virtue, put from &s;pite!&endq;</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation of the two men of the <HI>ton</HI> with Ca|milla
was &s;oon over. It was made up of a few di&s;|jointed
<PB N="181" REF="182">
&s;entences, abu&s;ing Tunbridge, and prai&s;ing the
German Spa, in cant words, emphatically and conceit|edly
pronounced, and brought round upon every occa|&s;ion,
and in every &s;peech, with &s;o preci&s;e an exclu&s;ion
of all other terms, that their vocabulary &s;carce con&s;i&s;ted
of forty words in totality.</P>
<P>Edgar occupied the &s;pace they vacated the moment of
their departure; but not alone; Mrs Mittin came into
it with him, eager to tell Camilla how every body had
admired her turban; how &s;weetly &s;he looked in it; how
every body &s;aid, they &s;hould not have known her again,
it became her &s;o; and how they all agreed her head had
never been &s;o well dre&s;&s;ed before.</P>
<P>Edgar, when he could be heard, began &s;peaking of
Sir Sedley Clarendel; he felt mi&s;erable in what he
thought her incon&s;iderate encouragement of &s;uch imper|tinence;
and the delicacy which re&s;trained him from
expre&s;&s;ing his opinion of the Major had no weight with
him here, as jealou&s;y had no &s;hare in his di&s;like to the
acquaintance: he believed the young Baronet in capable
of all love but for him&s;elf, and a decidedly de&s;tined ba|chelor:
without, therefore, the &s;malle&s;t he&s;itation, he
plainly avowed that he had never met with a more tho|roughly
conceited fop, a more elaborate and &s;elf-&s;uffici|ent
coxcomb.</P>
<P>&startq;You &s;ee him only,&endq; &s;aid Camilla, &startq;with the im|pre&s;&s;ion
made by his general appearance; and that is all
again&s;t him: I always look for his better qualities and
rejoice in finding them, His very &s;ight fills me with
grateful plea&s;ure, by reminding me of the deliverance I
owe to him.&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar, amazed, intreated an explanation; and,
when &s;he had given it, &s;truck and affected, cla&s;ped his
hands, and exclaimed: &startq;How providential &s;uch a
re&s;cue! and how differently &s;hall I henceforth behold
him!&endq; And almo&s;t involuntarily turning to Mrs. Arl|bery,
he intreated to be pre&s;ented to the young Baronet.</P>
<P>Sir Sedley received his overtures with &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e,
but great civility; and then went on with a ludicrous
account he was giving to Lord Newford and Sir Theo|philus,
of the quarrel of Macder&s;ey with Mr. Dub&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="183">
&startq;How awake thou art grown, Clary?&endq; cried Sir
Theophilus; &startq;A little while ago thou wa&s;t all hip and
vapour; and now thou do&s;t nothing but patroni&s;e fun.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, yes,&endq; an&s;wered the Baronet, &startq;I begin to
tire of <HI>ennui.</HI> 'Tis grown &s;o common. I &s;aw my foot|man
beginning it but la&s;t week.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, hang it! O, cur&s;e it!&endq; cried Lord Newford,
&startq;your footman!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, the rogue is not without parts. I don't
know if I &s;han't give him &s;ome le&s;&s;ons, upon leaving it
off my&s;elf. The only difficulty is to find out what, in
this nether world, to do without it. How can one fill
up one's time? Stretching, yawning, and all that, are
&s;uch delicious ingredients for coaxing on the hazy
hours!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, hang it, O, cur&s;e it,&endq; cried Lord Newford;
&startq;who can exi&s;t without them? I would not be bound
to pa&s;s half an hour without yawning and &s;tretching for
the Mogul's empire I'd rather &s;nap &s;hort at once.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, no, don't &s;nap &s;hort yet, little Newry,&endq; cri|ed
Sir Sedley. &startq;As to me, I am never at a lo&s;s for
an expedient. I am not without &s;ome thoughts of fall|ing
in love.&endq;</P>
<P>He looked at Edgar; who, not aware this was de|&s;igned
to catch his attention, naturally exclaimed:
&startq;Thoughts! can you choo&s;e, or avoid at plea&s;ure?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Mo&s;t certainly. After four-and-twenty a man is
&s;eldom taken by &s;urpri&s;e; at lea&s;t, not till he is pa&s;t
forty: and then, the fear of being too late, &s;ometimes
renovates the eagerne&s;s of the fir&s;t youth. But, in ge|neral,
your willing &s;laves are boys.&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar, laughing, begged a little information, how
he meant to put his thoughts in execution.</P>
<P>&startq;Nothing &s;o facile! 'Tis but to look at &s;ome fair
object attentively, to follow her with your eyes when
&s;he quits the room; never to let them re&s;t without
watching for her return; filling up the interval with a
few &s;ights; to which, in a &s;hort time, you grow &s;o ha|bituated,
that they become natural; and then, before
you are aware, a certain &s;olicitude and re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s ari&s;e,
<PB N="183" REF="184">
which the connoi&s;&s;eurs in natural hi&s;tory dub falling in
love.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The&s;e would be good hints,&endq; &s;aid Edgar, &startq;to
urge on waverers, who wi&s;h to per&s;uade them&s;elves to
marry.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O no, my dear &s;ir! no! that's a mi&s;take of the
fir&s;t magnitude; no man is in love when he marries.
He may have loved before; I have even heard he has
&s;ometimes loved after: but at the time never. There
is &s;omething in the formalities of the matrimonial prepa|rations
that drive away all the little cupidons. They
rarely &s;tand even a demand of con&s;ent&mdash;unle&s;s they
doubt obtaining it; but a &s;ettlement! Parchments!
Lawyers!&mdash;No! there is not a little Love in the I&s;land
of Cyprus, that is not ready to lend a wing to &s;et pa&s;&s;i|on,
in&s;piration, and tenderne&s;s to flight, from &s;uch ex|cruciating
legalities.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Don't pro&s;e, Clary; don't pro&s;e,&endq; cried Sir The|ophilus,
gaping till his mouth was almo&s;t di&s;torted.</P>
<P>&startq;O, killing! O, murder!&endq; cried Lord Newford;
&startq;what do&s;t talk of marriage for?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It &s;eems, then,&endq; &s;aid Edgar, &startq;to be much the
&s;ame thing what &s;ort of wife falls to a man's lot; whe|ther
the woman of his choice, or a per&s;on he &s;hould
blu&s;h to own?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Blu&s;h!&endq; repeated Sir Sedley, &s;miling; &startq;no!
no! A man of any fa&s;hion never blu&s;hes for his wife,
whatever &s;he may be. For his mi&s;tre&s;s, indeed, he may
blu&s;h: for if there are any &s;mall failings there, his
ta&s;te may be called in que&s;tion.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Blu&s;h about a wife!&endq; exclaimed Lord Newford;
&startq;O, hang it! O, cur&s;e it! that's too bad!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Too bad, indeed,&endq; cried Sir Theophilus; &startq;I
can't po&s;&s;ibly patroni&s;e blu&s;hing for a wife.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;'Tis the &s;ame, then, al&s;o,&endq; &s;aid Edgar, &startq;how
&s;he turns out when the knot is tied, whether well or
ill?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;To exactitude! If he marry her for beauty, let
her prove what &s;he may, her face offers his apology.
If for money, he needs none. But if, indeed, by &s;ome
queer chance, he marries with a view of living with
<PB N="184" REF="185">
her, then, indeed, if his particularity gets wind, he
may grow a little anxious for the acquittal of his oddi|ty,
in &s;eeing her approved.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Approved! Ha! ha!&endq; cried Lord Newford;
&startq;a wife approved! That's too bad, Clary; that's too
bad!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Poor Clary, what art pro&s;ing about?&endq; cried Sir
Theophilus. &startq;I can't po&s;&s;ibly patroni&s;e this pro&s;ing.&endq;</P>
<P>The entrance of the beautiful Mrs. Berlinton and
her tain now interrupted this conver&s;ation; the young
Baronet immediately joined her; though not till he had
given his hand to Edgar, in token of his willingne&s;s to
cultivate his acquaintance.</P>
<P>Edgar, returning to Camilla, confe&s;&s;ed he had too
ha&s;tily judged Sir Sedley, when he concluded him a
fool, as well as a fop; &startq;For,&endq; added he, with a &s;mile,
&startq;I &s;ee, now, one of tho&s;e epithets is all he merits.
He is certainly far from deficient in parts, though he
abu&s;es the good gifts of nature with &s;uch pedantry of
affectation and conceit.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla was now intent to clear the hi&s;tory of the
cotillon; when Mrs. Berlinton approaching, and, with
graceful fondne&s;s, taking her hand, entreated to be in|dulged
with her &s;ociety: and, &s;ince &s;he meant not to
dance, for Edgar had not a&s;ked her, and the Major &s;he
had refu&s;ed, &s;he could not re&s;i&s;t her invitation. She
had lo&s;t her fear of di&s;plea&s;ing Mrs. Arlbery by quitting
her, from conceiving a &s;till greater, of wearying by re|maining
with her.</P>
<P>Edgar, anxious both to under&s;tand and to di&s;cu&s;s
this new connexion, hovered about the party with un|remitting
vigilance. But, though he could not either
look at or li&s;ten to Mrs. Berlinton, without admiring
her, his admiration was neither free from cen&s;ure of
her&s;elf, nor terrour for her companion: he &s;aw her far
more beautiful than prudent, more amiable than digni|fied.
The females in her group were few, and little
worthy notice; the males appeared, to a man, without
di&s;gui&s;e, though not without re&s;traint, her lovers. And
though no one &s;eemed &s;elected, no one &s;eemed de&s;pi&s;ed;
&s;he appeared to admit their devoirs with little con&s;ide|ration;
<PB N="185" REF="186">
neither mode&s;tly retiring from power, nor vain|ly
di&s;playing it.</P>
<P>Camilla quitted not this enchantre&s;s till &s;ummoned
by Mrs. Arlbery; who, &s;eeing her&s;elf again, from the
arrival of Lady Alithea Selmore, without any di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
party, that lady drawing into her circle all peo|ple
of any con&s;equence not already attracted by Mrs.
Berlinton, grew &s;ick of the ball and the rooms, and
impatient to return home. Camilla, in retiring, pre|&s;ented,
folded in a paper, the guinea, half-guinea, and
&s;ilver, &s;he had borrowed of Sir Sedley; who received
it without pre&s;uming at any conte&s;t; though not, after
what he had heard from Mrs. Arlbery, without reluc|tance.</P>
<P>Edgar watched the in&s;tant when Camilla moved from
the gay group; but Mrs. Mittin watched it al&s;o; and,
approaching her more &s;peedily, becau&s;e with le&s;s em|barra&s;&s;ment,
&s;eized her arm before he could reach her:
and before he could, with any di&s;cretion, glide to her
other &s;ide, Mi&s;s Dennel was there.</P>
<P>&startq;Well now, young ladies,&endq; &s;aid Mrs. Mittin,
&startq;I'm going to tell you a &s;ecret. Do you know, for
all I call my&s;elf Mrs. I'm &s;ingle?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Dear, la!&endq; exclaimed Mi&s;s Dennel; &startq;and for
all you're &s;o old!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;So old, Mi&s;s! Who told you I was &s;o old? I'm
not &s;o very old as you may think me. I'm no particu|lar
age, I a&s;&s;ure you. Why, what made you think of
that?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;La, I don't know; only you don't look very
young.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I can't help that, Mi&s;s Dennel. Perhaps you
mayn't look young your&s;elf one of the&s;e days. People
can't always &s;tand &s;till ju&s;t at a particular minute. Why
how old, now, do you take me to be? Come, be &s;in|cere.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;La! I'm &s;ure I can't tell; only I thought you was
an old woman.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;An old woman! Lord, my dear, people would
laugh to hear you. You don't know what an old wo|man
is. Why it's being a cripple, and blind, and deaf,
<PB N="186" REF="187">
and dumb, and &s;lavering, and without a tooth. Pray,
how am I like all that?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Nay, I'm &s;ure I don't know; only I thought, by
the look of your face, your mu&s;t be mon&s;trous old.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Lord, I can't think what you've got in your head,
Mi&s;s Dennel! I never heard as much before, &s;ince I
was born. Why the rea&s;on I'm called Mrs. is not be|cau&s;e
of that, I a&s;&s;ure you; but becau&s;e I'd a mind to
be taken for a young widow, on account that every bo|dy
likes a young widow; and if one is called Mi&s;s, peo|ple
begin &s;o &s;oon to think one an old maid, that it's quite
di&s;agreeable.&endq;</P>
<P>This di&s;cour&s;e brought them to the carriage.</P>

<P>THE following morning, Mrs. Mittin came with
eager intelligence, that the raffle was fixed for one
o'clock; and, without any &s;cruple, accompanied the
party to the &s;hop, addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to every one of the
&s;et as to a confirmed and intimate friend. But her
chief &s;upporter was Mr. Dennel, who&s;e prai&s;e of her
was the vehicle to his cen&s;ure of his &s;i&s;ter-in-law. That
lady was the per&s;on in the world whom he mo&s;t feared
and di&s;liked. He had neither &s;pirit for the &s;plendid
manner in which &s;he lived, nor parts for the vivacity of
her conver&s;ation. The fir&s;t, his love of money made
him condemn as extravagant, and the latter his &s;elf-love
made him hate, becau&s;e he could not under&s;tand.
He per&s;uaded him&s;elf, therefore, that &s;he had more
words than meaning; and extolled all the obvious
<PB N="187" REF="188">
truths uttered by Mrs. Mittin, to &s;hew his &s;uperior ad|miration
of what, being plain and incontrovertible, he
dignified with the panegyric of being &s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P>When they came upon the Pantiles, they were ac|co&s;ted
by Mr. Dub&s;ter; who having &s;olemnly a&s;ked
them, one by one, how they all did, joined Mrs. Mit|tin,
&s;aying; &startq;Well, I can't pretend as I'm over &s;or|ry
you've got neither of tho&s;e two comical gentlemen
with you, that behaved &s;o free to me for nothing. I
don't think it's particular agreeable being treated &s;o;
though it's a thing I don't much mind. It's not worth
fretting about.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, don't &s;ay any more about it,&endq; cried Mrs.
Mittin, endeavouring to &s;hake him off; &startq;I dare &s;ay
you did &s;omething to provoke 'em, or they're too gen|teel
to have taken notice of you.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Me provoke them! why what did I do? I was
ju&s;t like a mere lamb, as one may &s;ay, at the very time
that young Captain fell abu&s;ing me &s;o, calling of me a
little dirty fellow, without no provocation. If I'm lit|tle,
or big, I don't &s;ee that it's any bu&s;ine&s;s of his.
And as to dirty, I'd put on all clean linen but the very
day before, as the people can tell you at the inn; &s;o
the whole was a mere piece of fal&s;ehood from one end
to t'other.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, well, what do you talk about it for any more?
You &s;hould never take any thing ill of a young gentle|man.
It's only aggravating him &s;o much the wor&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Aggravating him, Mrs. Mittin! why what need I
mind that? Do you think I'm to put up with his talk|ing
of caning me, and &s;uch like, becau&s;e of his being a
young gentleman? Not I, I a&s;&s;ure you! I'm no &s;uch
per&s;on. And if once I feel his &s;witch acro&s;s the&s;e here
&s;houlders, it won't be &s;o well for him!&endq;</P>
<P>The party now entered the &s;hop where the raffle was
to be held.</P>
<P>Edgar was already there; he had no power to keep
away from any place where he was &s;ure to behold Ca|milla;
and a raffle brought to his mind the mo&s;t tender
recollections. He was now with Lord O'Lerney, in
who&s;e candour and benevolence of character he took

great delight, and with whom he had joined Lady I&s;a|bella
Irby, who had been drawn, as a quiet &s;pectatre&s;s,
to the &s;ight, by a friend, who, having never &s;een the hu|mours
of a raffle, had entreated, through her means,
to look on. He langui&s;hed to &s;ee Camilla pre&s;ented to
this lady, in who&s;e manners and conver&s;ation, dignity
and &s;implicity were equally blended</P>
<P>While he was yet, though ab&s;ently, conver&s;ing with
them, Lord O'Lerney pointed out Camilla to Lady I&s;a|bella.</P>
<P>&startq;I have taken notice of her already at the rooms;&endq;
an&s;wered her Lady&s;hip; and I have &s;eldom, I think,
&s;een a more intere&s;ting young creature&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The character of her countenance,&endq; &s;aid Lord O'|Lerney,
&startq;&s;trikes me very peculiarly. 'Tis &s;o intelli|gent,
yet &s;o unhackneyed, &s;o full of meaning, yet &s;o art|le&s;s,
that, while I look at her, I feel my&s;elf involunta|rily
anxious for her welfare.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I don't think &s;he &s;eems happy,&endq; &s;aid Lady I&s;abella;
&startq;Do you know who &s;he is, my Lord?&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar, here, with difficulty &s;uppre&s;&s;ed a &s;igh. Not
happy! thought he; ah! wherefore? what can make
Camilla unhappy?</P>
<P>&startq;I under&s;tand &s;he is a niece of Sir Hugh Tyrold,&endq;
an&s;wered his Lord&s;hip; &startq;a York&s;hire Baronet. She
is here with an acquaintance of mine, Mrs. Arlbery,
who is one of the fir&s;t women I have ever known, for
wit and capacity. She has an excellent heart, too;
though her extraordinary talents, and her carele&s;sne&s;s of
opinion make it &s;ometimes, but very unju&s;tly, doubted.&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar heard this with much plea&s;ure. A good word
from Lord O'Lerney quieted many fears; he hoped he
had been unnece&s;&s;arily alarmed; he determined, in fu|ture,
to judge her more favourably.</P>
<P>&startq;I &s;hould be glad,&endq; continued his lord&s;hip, &startq;to hear
this young lady were either well e&s;tabli&s;hed, or returned
to her friends without becoming an object of public no|tice.
A young woman is no where &s;o rarely re&s;pect|able,
or re&s;pected, as at the&s;e water-drinking places, if
&s;een at them either long or often. The &s;earch of plea|&s;ure
and di&s;&s;ipation, at a &s;pot con&s;ecrated for re&s;toring
<PB N="189" REF="192">
health to the &s;ick, the infirm, and the &s;uffering, carries
with it an air of egoti&s;m, that does not give the mo&s;t
plea&s;ant idea of the feeling and di&s;po&s;ition.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yet, may not the &s;ick, my lord, be rather amended
than hurt by the &s;ight of gaiety around them?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, my dear Lady I&s;abella; and the effect there|fore,
I believe to be beneficial. But as this is not the
motive why the young and the gay &s;eek the&s;e &s;pots, it is
not here they will find them&s;elves mo&s;t honoured. And
the mixture of pain and illne&s;s with &s;plendour and fe&s;ti|vity,
is &s;o unnatural, that probably it is to that we mu&s;t
attribute that a young woman is no where &s;o hardly
judged. If &s;he is without fortune, &s;he is thought a fe|male
adventurer, &s;eeking to &s;ell her&s;elf for its attain|ment;
if &s;he is rich, &s;he is &s;uppo&s;ed a willing dupe,
ready for a &s;nare, and only looking about for an en|&s;narer.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And yet, young women, &s;eldom, I believe, my
lord, merit this &s;everity of judgment. They come but
hither in the &s;ummer, as they go to London in the win|ter,
&s;imply in &s;earch of amu&s;ement, without any particu|lar
purpo&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;True; but they do not weigh what their ob&s;ervers
weigh for them, that the &s;earch of public recreation in
the winter is, from long habit, permitted without cen|&s;ure;
but that the &s;ummer has not, as yet, pre&s;cription &s;o
po&s;itively in its favour; and tho&s;e who, after meeting
them all the winter at the opera, and all the &s;pring at
Renelagh hear of them all the &s;ummer at Cheltenham,
Tunbridge, &amp;c. and all the autumn at Bath, are apt to
inquire, when is the &s;ea&s;on for home.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ah, my lord! how wide are the poor incon&s;iderate
little flutterers from being aware of &s;uch a que&s;tion! how
nece&s;&s;ary to youth and thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s is the wi&s;dom of
experience!&endq;</P>
<P>Why does &s;he not come this way? thought Edgar;
why does &s;he not gather from the&s;e mild, yet under|&s;tanding
morali&s;ts, in&s;truction that might benefit all her
future life?</P>
<P>&startq;There is nothing,&endq; &s;aid Lord O'Lerney, &startq;I more
&s;incerely pity than the delu&s;ions &s;urrounding young fe|males.
<PB N="190" REF="193">
The &s;tronge&s;t admirers of their eyes are fre|quently
the mo&s;t au&s;tere &s;atiri&s;ts of their conduct.&endq;</P>
<P>The entrance of Lord Newford, Sir Theophilus Ja|rard,
and Sir Sedley Clarendel, all noi&s;ily talking and
laughing together, interrupted any further conver&s;ation.
The two former no &s;ooner &s;aw Camilla, and perceived
neither Lady Alithea Selmore, nor Mrs. Berlinton, than
they made up to her; and Sir Sedley, who now found
&s;he was completely e&s;tabli&s;hed in the <HI>bon ton,</HI> felt &s;ome|thing
of pride mix with plea&s;ure in publicly availing
him&s;elf of his intimacy with her; and &s;omething like in|tere&s;t
mix with curio&s;ity, in examining if Edgar were
&s;truck with her ready attention to him.</P>
<P>Upon Edgar, however, it made not the &s;lighte&s;t im|pre&s;&s;ion.
While Sir Sedley had appeared to him a mere
fop, he had thought it degraded her; but now he re|garded
him as her pre&s;erver, it &s;eemed both natural and
merited.</P>
<P>Sir Sedley, not aware of this rea&s;oning, was &s;ome|what
piqued; and taking him to another part of the
&s;hop, whi&s;pered: &startq;I am horribly vapoured! Do you
know I have &s;ome thoughts of trying that little girl?
Do you think one could make any thing of her?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;How? what do you mean?&endq; cried Edgar, with
&s;udden alarm.</P>
<P>Sir Sedley, a little flattered, affectedly an&s;wered:
&startq;O, if you have any &s;erious de&s;igns that way, incon|te&s;tably
I won't interefere.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Me!&endq; cried Edgar, &s;urpri&s;ed and offended; &startq;be|lieve
me, no! I have all my life con&s;idered her&mdash;as
my &s;i&s;ter.&endq;</P>
<P>Sir Sedley &s;aw this was &s;poken with effort; and neg|ligently
replied: &startq;Nay you are ju&s;t at the fir&s;t epocha
for marrying from inclination; but you are in the right
not to perform &s;o &s;oon the funeral honours of liberty.
'Tis what you may do at any time. So many girls
want e&s;tabli&s;hments, that a man of &s;ixty can ju&s;t as ea|&s;ily
get a wife of eighteen, as a man of one-and-twenty.
The only inconvenience in that &s;ort of alliance is, that
though &s;he begins with &s;ubmitting to her venerated hu&s;|band
as prettily as to her papa, &s;he is terribly apt to have
<PB N="191" REF="194">
a knack of running away from him, afterwards, with
equal facility.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That is $ather a di&s;couraging article I confe&s;s,&endq;
cried Edgar, &startq;for the $ardy votaries of Hymen!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, no! 'tis no great matter!&endq; an&s;wered he, pat|ting
his &s;nuff-box; &startq;we are impenetrable in the ex|treme
to tho&s;e &s;ort of grievances now-a-days. We are
at &s;uch prodigious expence of &s;en&s;ibility in public, for
tales of &s;orrow told about pathetically, at a full board,
that if we &s;uffered much for our private concerns to
boot, we mu&s;t always meet one another with tears in
our eyes. We never weep now, but at dinner, or at
&s;ome diver&s;ion.&endq;</P>
<P>Lord Newford, pulling him by the arm, called out:
&startq;Come, Clary&punc; what art about, man? we want thee.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Come, Clary! don't &s;hrink, Clary,&endq; cried Sir
Theophilus; &startq;I can't po&s;&s;ibly patroni&s;e this &s;krinking.&endq;
And they hauled him to a corner of the &s;hop, where
all three re&s;umed their cu&s;tomary laughing whi&s;pers.</P>
<P>&startq;You will not, perhaps, &s;u&s;pect, Lady I&s;abella,&endq;
&s;aid Lord O'Lerney, &s;miling, &startq;that one of that tri|umvirate
is by no means deficient in parts, and can even,
when he de&s;ires it, be extremely plea&s;ing?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Your Lord&s;hip judges right, I confe&s;s! I had not,
indeed, done him &s;uch ju&s;tice!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;See then,&endq; &s;aid his Lord&s;hip&punc; &startq;how futile an ani|mal
is man, without &s;ome decided character and prin|ciple!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He's every thing by turns, and nothing long<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Dryden's Ab&s;alom and Achytophel.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>Wi&s;e, fooli&s;h; virtuous, vicious; active, indolent;
prodigal and avaricious! No contra&s;t is too &s;trong for
him while guided but by accident or impul&s;e. This
gentleman al&s;o, in common with the re&s;t of his <HI>tonni&s;h</HI>
brethren, is now daily, though uncon&s;ciou&s;ly, hoarding
up a world of unprepared-for mortification, by not fore|&s;eeing
that the more he is celebrated in his youth, for
being the leader of the <HI>ton,</HI> and the man of the day, the
<PB N="192" REF="195">
earlier he will be regarded as a creature out of date, an
old beau, and a fine gentleman of former times. But
'tis by rever&s;es, &s;uch as the&s;e, that folly and impropriety
pay their penalties. We might &s;pare all our anger
again&s;t the vanity of the beauty, or the conceit of the
coxcomb. Are not wrinkles always in waiting to pu|ni&s;h
the one, and age, without honour, to cha&s;ti&s;e and
degrade the other?&endq;</P>
<P>All the rafflers were now arrived except Mrs. Ber|linton,
who was impatiently expected. Lady Alithea
Selmore had already &s;ent a proxy to throw for her in
her own woman; much to the di&s;&s;atisfaction of mo&s;t
part of the company. A general ri&s;ing and inquietude
to look out for Mrs. Berlinton, gave Edgar, at length,
an opportunity to &s;tand next to Camilla. &startq;How I
grieve,&endq; he cried, &startq;you &s;hould not know Lady I&s;a|bella
Irby! &s;he &s;eems to me a model for a woman of
rank in her manners, and a model for a woman of
every &s;tation in her mind. The world, I believe,
could &s;carce have tempted her to &s;o offen&s;ive a mark of
&s;uperiority as has ju&s;t been exhibited by Lady Alithea
Selmore, who has ingeniou&s;ly di&s;covered a method
of being &s;ignali&s;ed as the mo&s;t important per&s;on out of
twenty, by making her&s;elf nineteen enemies.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I wonder,&endq; &s;aid Camilla, &startq;&s;he can think the
chance of the ear-rings worth &s;o high a price!&endq;</P>
<P>A footman, in a &s;plendid livery, now entering, in|quired
for Mi&s;s Tyrold. She was pointed out to him
by Major Cerwood, and he delivered her a letter from
Mrs. Berlinton.</P>
<P>The contents were to intreat &s;he would throw for
that lady, who was in the mid&s;t of Aken&s;ide's Plea|&s;ures
of the Imagination, and could not tear her&s;elf
away from them.</P>
<P>Camilla blu&s;hed exce&s;&s;ively in proclaiming &s;he was
cho&s;en Mrs. Berlinton's proxy. Edgar &s;aw with ten|derne&s;s
her mode&s;t confu&s;ion, and, with a plea&s;ure the
mo&s;t touching, read the favourable impre&s;&s;ion it made
upon Lord O'Lerney and Lady I&s;abella.</P>
<P>This &s;eemed an opportunity irre&s;&s;i&s;tible for venting
his fears and cautions about Mrs. Berlinton; and, tak|ing
<PB N="193" REF="196">
the bu&s;tling period in which the rafflers were ar|ranging
the order and manner and of throwing, he
&s;aid, in a low, and diffident tone of voice, &startq;You have
committed to me an important and, I fear, an importu|nate
office; yet while I hold, I cannot per&s;uade my|&s;elf
not to fulfil it; though I know that to give advice
which oppo&s;es &s;entiment and feeling, is repugnant to in|dependence
and to delicacy. Such, therefore, I do
not mean to enforce; but merely to offer hints&mdash;inti|mations
&mdash;and ob&s;ervations&mdash;that without controlling,
may put you upon your guard.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, affected by this unexpected addre&s;s, could
only look her de&s;ire for an explanation.</P>
<P>&startq;The lady,&endq; he continued, &startq;whom you are pre|&s;ently
to repre&s;ent, appears to be uncommonly en|gaging?&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Indeed &s;he is! She is attractive, gentle, amiable.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;She &s;eems, al&s;o, already to have caught your af|fection?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Who could have withheld it, that had &s;een her
as I have &s;een her? She is as unhappy as &s;he is
lovely?&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have heard of your fir&s;t meeting, with as much
plea&s;ure in the pre&s;ence of mind it called forth on one
&s;ide, as with doubt and perplexity, upon every cir|cum&s;tance
I can gather of the other.&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If you knew her, you would find it impo&s;&s;ible
to hold any doubts; impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;i&s;t admiring, com|pa&s;&s;ionating,
and loving her!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If my knowledge of her bribed an intere&s;t in her
favour, without convincing me &s;he de&s;erved it, I ought
rather, to regret that you have not e&s;caped falling into
&s;uch a &s;nare, than that I could have e&s;caped it my&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I believe her free, nay incapable of all ill!&endq; cried
Camilla warntly; &startq;though I dare not a&s;&s;ert &s;he is al|ways
coolly upon her guard.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Do not let me hurt you,&endq; &s;aid Edgar, gently:
&startq;I have &s;een how lovely &s;he is in per&s;on, and how
plea&s;ing in manners. And &s;he is &s;o young that, were
&s;he in a &s;ituation le&s;s expo&s;ed, want of &s;teadine&s;s or
judgment might, by a little time, be &s;et right. But
<PB N="194" REF="197">
here, there is &s;urely much to fear from her early po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of power.&mdash;O, that &s;ome happier chance had
brought about &s;uch a peculiar intercour&s;e for you with
Lady I&s;abella Irby! There, to the plea&s;ure of friend|&s;hip,
might be added the mode&s;ty of retired elegance,
and the &s;ecurity of e&s;tabli&s;hed re&s;pectability.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And may not this yet happen, with Mrs. Berlin|ton?
Lady I&s;abella, though &s;till young, is not in the
extreme youth of Mrs. Berlinton: a few more years,
therefore, may bring equal di&s;cretion; and as &s;he
has already every other good quality, you may here|after
equally approve her.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Do you think, then,&endq; &s;aid Edgar, half &s;miling,
&startq;that the few years of difference in their age were
&s;pent by Lady I&s;abella in the manner they are now
&s;pent by Mrs. Berlinton? do you think &s;he paved the
way for her pre&s;ent dignified, though una&s;&s;uming
character, by permitting her&s;elf to be &s;urrounded by
profe&s;&s;ed admirers? by letting their &s;ighs reach her
ears? by &s;uffering their eyes to fa&s;ten with open rap|ture
on her face? and by holding it &s;ufficient not to
&s;uppre&s;s &s;uch liberties, &s;o long as &s;he does not avowedly
encourage them?&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla was &s;tartled. She had not &s;een her con|duct
in this light: yet her under&s;tanding refu&s;ed to de|ny
it might bear this interpretation.</P>
<P>Charmed with the candour of her &s;ilence, Edgar
continued, &startq;How wide from all that is open to &s;imi|lar
comment, is the carriage and behaviour of Lady
I&s;abella! how clear! how tran&s;parent, how free from
all conjecture of blemi&s;h! They may each, indeed,
e&s;&s;entially be equally innocent; and your opinion of
Mrs Berlinton corroborates the impre&s;&s;ion made by
her beautiful countenance: yet how far more highly
is the true feminine character pre&s;erved, where &s;urmi&s;e
is not rai&s;ed, than where it can be parried! Think but
of tho&s;e two ladies, and mark the difference. Lady
I&s;abella, addre&s;&s;ed only where known, followed only
becau&s;e loved, &s;ees no adulators encircling her, for adu|lation
would alarm her; no admirers paying her ho|mage,
for &s;uch homage would offend her. She knows
<PB N="195" REF="198">
&s;he has not only her own innocence to guard, but the ho|nour
of her hu&s;band. Whether &s;he is happy with him
or not, this depo&s;it is equally &s;acred.&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>He &s;topt; for Camilla again &s;tarted. The irrepre&s;|&s;ible
frankne&s;s of her nature revolted again&s;t denying
how much this la&s;t &s;entence &s;truck her, and &s;he inge|nuou&s;ly
exclaimed: &startq;O that this mo&s;t amiable young
creature were but more aware of this duty!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ah, my dear Mi&s;s Camilla,&endq; cried Edgar, with
energy, &startq;&s;ince you feel and own&mdash;and with you, that
is always one&mdash;this baneful deficiency, drop, or at
lea&s;t &s;u&s;pend an intercour&s;e too hazardous to be indulg|ed
with propriety! See what &s;he may be &s;ometime
hence, ere you contract further intimacy. At pre&s;ent,
unexperienced and un&s;u&s;picious, her dangers may be
yours. You are too young for &s;uch a ri&s;k. Fly, fly
from it, my dear Mi&s;s Camilla!&mdash;as if the voice of your
mother were calling out to caution you!&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla was deeply touched. An intere&s;t &s;o warm
in her welfare was &s;oothing, and the name of her mo|ther
rendered it awaful; yet, thus united, it appeared to
her more &s;trongly than ever to announce it&s;elf as mere|ly
fraternal. She could not &s;uppre&s;s a &s;igh; but he
attributed it to the reque&s;t he had urged, and, with
much concern, added: &startq;What I have a&s;ked of you,
then, is too &s;evere?&endq;</P>
<P>Again irre&s;i&s;tibly &s;ighing, yet collecting all her force
to conceal the &s;ecret cau&s;e, &s;he an&s;wered, &startq;If &s;he
is thus expo&s;ed to danger&mdash;if her &s;ituation is &s;o peri|lous,
ought I not rather to &s;tay by, and help to &s;up|port
her, than by abandoning, perhaps contribute to the
evil you think awaiting her?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Generous Camilla,&endq; cried he, melted into tender
admiration, &startq;who can oppo&s;e &s;o kind a de&s;ign? So
noble a nature!&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>No more could be &s;aid, for all preliminaries had
been &s;ettled, and the throwing being arranged to take
place alphabetically, &s;he was &s;oon &s;ummoned to repre|&s;ent
Mrs. Berlinton.</P>
<P>From this time, Edgar could &s;peak to her no more:
even the Major could &s;carcely make way to her: the
<PB N="196" REF="199">
two men of the <HI>ton</HI> would not quit her, and Sir Sedley
Clarendel appeared openly devoted to her.</P>
<P>Edgar looked on with the keene&s;t emotion. The proof
he had ju&s;t received that her intrin&s;ic worth was in its
fir&s;t &s;tate of excellence, had come home to his heart,
and the fear of &s;eeing her altered and &s;poilt, by the
flatteries and dangers which environed her, with his
wavering belief in her engagement with Major Cer|wood,
made him more wretched than ever. But when
&s;ome time after, &s;he was called upon to throw for her|&s;elf,
the recollection that, from the former raffle, her
half-guinea, even when the prize was in her hand, had
been voluntarily withdrawn to be be&s;towed upon a poor
family, &s;o powerfully affected him, that he could not
re&s;t in the &s;hop; he was obliged to breathe a freer air,
and to hide his di&s;turbance by a retreat.</P>
<P>Her throw was the highe&s;t the dice had yet afforded.
A Mi&s;s Williams alone came after her, who&s;e throw
was the lowe&s;t; Mi&s;s Camilla Tyrold, therefore, was
proclaimed to be the winner.</P>
<P>This &s;econd te&s;timony of the favour of fortune was a
mo&s;t plea&s;ant &s;urprize to Camilla, and made the room
re&s;ound with felicitations, till they were interrupted by
a violent quarrel upon the Pantiles, whence the voice
of Macder&s;ey was heard, hollooing out: &startq;Don't talk,
I &s;ay &s;ir! don't pre&s;ume to &s;ay a word!&endq; and that of
Mr. Dub&s;ter angrily an&s;wering, he would talk as long
as he thought proper, whether it was agreeable or not.</P>
<P>Sir Sedley advanced to the combatants, in order to
help on the di&s;pute; but Edgar returning at the &s;ound
of high words, took the En&s;ign by the arm, and pre|vailed
with him to accompany him up and down the
Pantiles; while Mrs. Mittin ran to Mr. Dub&s;ter, and
pulling him into the &s;hop, &s;aid: &startq;Mr. Dub&s;ter, if I'm
not a&s;hamed of you! how can you forget your&s;elf &s;o?
talking to gentlemen at &s;uch a rate!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, what &s;hould hinder me?&endq; cried he; &startq;do
you think I &s;hall put up with every thing as I u&s;ed to
do when you fir&s;t knew me, and we u&s;ed to meet at
Mr. Typton's, the tallow chandler's in Shug-lane? no,
Mrs. Mittin, nor no &s;uch a thing; I'm turned gentleman
<PB N="197" REF="200">
my&s;elf, now, as much as the be&s;t of 'em; for I've no|thing
to do, but ju&s;t what I choo&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I prote&s;t, Mr. Dub&s;ter,&endq; cried Mrs. Mittin,
taking him into a corner, &startq;you're enough to put a &s;aint
into a pet! how come you to think of talking of Mr.
Typton here? before &s;uch gentlefolks? and where's
the u&s;e of telling every body he's a tallow chandler?
and as to my meeting with you there once or &s;o, in a
way, I de&s;ire you'll mention it no more; for it's &s;o
long ago, I have no recollection of it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No! why don't you remember&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Fiddle, faddle, what's the good of ripping up old
&s;tories about nothing? when you're with genteel peo|ple,
you mu&s;t do as I do; never talk about bu&s;ine&s;s at
all.&endq;</P>
<P>Macder&s;ey now entered the &s;hop, appea&s;ed by Ed|gar
from &s;hewing any further wrath, but wantonly in|flamed
by Sir Sedley, in a di&s;pute upon the pa&s;&s;ion of
love.</P>
<P>&startq;Do you always, my dear friend,&endq; &s;aid the Baronet,
&startq;fall in love at fir&s;t &s;ight?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;To be &s;ure I do! If a man makes a &s;cruple of
that, it's ten to one but he's di&s;appointed of doing it
at all; becau&s;e, after two or three &s;econd &s;ights,
the danger is you may &s;py out fome little flaw in the
dear angel, that takes off the ze&s;t, and hinders you to
the longe&s;t day you have to live.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Profoundly cogitated that! you think then, my
va&s;t dear &s;ir, the pa&s;&s;ion had more conveniently be kind|led
fir&s;t, that the flaws may appear after to cure it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, &s;ir, no! when a man's once in love, tho&s;e
flaws don't &s;ignify, becau&s;e he can't &s;ee them; or,
if hecould, at lea&s;t he'd &s;corn to own them.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Live for ever brave Ireland!&endq; exclaimed Mrs.
Arlbery; &startq;what cold phlegmatic Engli&s;hman would
have made a &s;peech of &s;o much gallantry?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;As to an Engli&s;hman,&endq; &s;aid Macder&s;ey, &startq;you
mu&s;t never mind what he &s;ays about the ladies,
becau&s;e he's too &s;heepi&s;h to &s;peak out. He's ju&s;t as
often in love as his neighbours, only he's &s;o &s;hy he
won't own it, till he &s;ees if the young fair one is as|much
<PB N="198" REF="201">
in love as him&s;elf; but a generous Iri&s;hman ne|ver
&s;cruples to proclaim the girl of his heart, though he
&s;hould have twenty in a year.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But is that perfectly delicate, my deare&s;t &s;ir, to the
&s;everal Dulcineas!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Perfectly! your Iri&s;hman is the delicate&s;t man
upon earth to the fair &s;ex; for he always talks of their
cruelty, if they are never &s;o kind. He knows every
hone&s;t heart will pity him, if its true; and if it i'n't,
he is too much a man of honour not to complain all one;
he knows how agreeable it is to the dear creatures; they
always take it for a compliment.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Whether avowedly or clande&s;tinely,&endq; &s;aid Mrs.
Arlbery, &startq;&s;till you are all in our chains. Even where
you play the tyrant with us, we occupy all your
thoughts; and if you have not the &s;kill to make us hap|py,
your next delight is to make us mi&s;erable; for tho'
now and then, you can contrive to hate, you can never
arrive at forgetting us.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Contrive to hate you!&endq; repeated Macder&s;ey; &startq;I
could as &s;oon contrive to turn the world into a potatoe;
there is nothing upon earth, nothing under the whole
firmament I value but beauty!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;A chearful gla&s;s, then,&endq; &s;aid Sir Sedley, &startq;you
think horridly intolerable?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;A chearful gla&s;s, &s;ir! do you take me for a milk|&s;op?
do you think I don't know what it is to be a man?
a chearful gla&s;s, &s;ir, is the fir&s;t plea&s;ure in life; the
mo&s;t convivial, the mo&s;t exhilirating, the mo&s;t friendly
joy of a true hone&s;t &s;oul! what were exi&s;tence without
it? I &s;hould choo&s;e to be off in half an hour;
which I &s;hould only make &s;o long, not to &s;hock my
friends.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, the gla&s;s is not what I patroni&s;e,&endq; &s;aid Sir
Theophilus; &startq;it hips me &s;o con&s;umedly the next day;
no, I can't patroni&s;e the gla&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Not patroni&s;e wine?&endq; cried Lord Newford; &startq;O
hang it! O cur&s;e it! that's too bad, Offy! but hunting!
what do&s;t think of that, little Offy?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Too ob&s;treperous! It rou&s;es one at &s;uch aukward
hours; no, I can't patroni&s;e hunting.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="202">
&startq;Hunting!&endq; cried Macder&s;ey; &startq;O, it leaves every
thing behind it; 'tis the thing upon the earth for
which I have the true&s;t ta&s;te. I know nothing el&s;e that
is not a bauble to it. A man is no more, in my
e&s;timation, than a child, or a woman, that don't enjoy
it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Cards, then,&endq; &s;aid Sir Sedley, &startq;you repro|bate?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And dice?&endq;&mdash;cried Lord Newford&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;And betting?&endq;&mdash;cried Sir Theophilus.</P>
<P>&startq;Why what do you take me for, gentlemen?&endq; re|plied
Macder&s;ey, hotly; &startq;Do you think I have no
&s;oul? no fire? no feeling? Do you &s;uppo&s;e me a
&s;tone? a block? a lump of lead? I &s;corn &s;uch &s;u&s;pi|cions;
I don't hold them worth an&s;wering. I am
none of that torpid, morbid, drow&s;y tribe. I hold
nobody to have an idea of life that has not rattled in
his own hand the dear little box of promi&s;e. What
ec&s;ta&s;y not to know if in two &s;econds, one mayn't be
worth ten thou&s;and pounds! or el&s;e without a farthing!
how it puts one on the rack! There's nothing to com|pare
with it. I would not give up that moment to be
&s;overeign of the Ea&s;t Indies! no, not if the We&s;t were
to be put into the bargain.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;All the&s;e things,&endq; &s;aid Mr. Dennel, &startq;are fit for
nothing but to bring a man to ruin. The main chance
is all that is worth thinking of. 'Tis money makes
the mare to go; and I don't know any thing that's to
be done without it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Money!&endq; exclaimed Macder&s;ey, &startq;'tis the thing
under heaven I hold in the mo&s;t di&s;dain. It won't
give me a moment's concern never to &s;ee its colour
again. I vow &s;olemnly, if it were not ju&s;t for the plea|&s;ures
of the table, and a jolly gla&s;s with a friend, and
a few hor&s;e in one's &s;table, and a little ready ca&s;h in
one's pur&s;e, for odd u&s;es, I &s;hould not care if the mint
were &s;unk under ground to-morrow; money is what I
mo&s;t de&s;pi&s;e of all.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That's talking out of rea&s;on,&endq; &s;aid Mr. Dennel,
walking out of the &s;hop with great di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="203">
&startq;Why,&endq; if I was to &s;peak, &startq;&s;aid Mr. Dub&s;ter, en|couraged
to come forward, by an ob&s;ervation &s;o much
to his own comprehen&s;ion and ta&s;te as the la&s;t; &startq;I
can't but &s;ay I think the &s;ame; for money&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Keep your di&s;tance, &s;ir!&endq; cried the fiery En&s;ign,
&startq;keep your di&s;tance, I tell you! if you don't wi&s;h I
&s;hould &s;ay &s;omething to you pretty cutting.&endq;</P>
<P>This broke up the party, which el&s;e the lounging
&s;pirit of the place, and the general con&s;ent by which
all de&s;criptions of characters &s;eem determined to oc|cupy
any &s;pot whatever, to avoid a moment's abode in
their lodgings, would &s;till have detained till the dinner
hour had forced to their re&s;pective homes. $word$ &s;up|pre&s;s
all po&s;&s;ibility of further di&s;&s;ention, Mrs. Arlbery
put Mi&s;s Dennel under the care of Macder&s;ey, and bid
him attend her towards Mount Plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>Mr. Dub&s;ter, having &s;tared after them &s;ome time in
&s;ilence, called out: &startq;Keep my di&s;tance! I can't but
&s;ay but what I think that young Captain the rude&s;t
young gentleman I ever happened to light upon! how|ever,
if he don't like me, I &s;han't take it much to
heart; I can't pretend to &s;ay I like him any better; &s;o
he may choo&s;e; it's much the &s;ame to me; it breaks
no &s;quares.&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar, almo&s;t without knowing it, followed Camilla,
but he could di&s;place neither the Baronet nor the Major,
who, one with a look of open exultation, and the other
with an air of determined per&s;everance, retained each
his po&s;t at her &s;ide.</P>
<P>He &s;aw that her voluntary attention was to Sir Sed|ley,
and that the Major had none but what was called
for and inevitable. Was this indifference, or &s;ecurity?
was &s;he &s;eeking to obtain in the Baronet a new adorer,
or to excite jealou&s;y, through his means, $n an old
one? Silent he walked on, perpetually exclaiming to
him&s;elf: &startq;Can it be Camilla, the ingenuous, the artle&s;s
Camilla, I find it &s;o difficult to fathom, to comprehend,
to tru&s;t?</P>
<P>He had not &s;pirits to join Mrs. Arlbery, though he
lamented he had not, at once, vi&s;ited her; &s;ince it was
now awkward to take &s;uch a &s;tep without an invitation,
<PB REF="204">
which &s;he &s;eemed by no means di&s;po&s;ed to offer him.
She internally re&s;ented the little de&s;ire he had
ever manife&s;ted for her acquaintance; and they
had both too much penetration not to perceive
how wide either was from being the favourite of
the other.</P>
