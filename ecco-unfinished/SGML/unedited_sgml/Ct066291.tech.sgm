<P>THE Author of this Book thought him&s;elf oblig'd
to Dedicate it to your Maje&s;ty fir&s;t, as an Hum|ble
Acknowledgment of your Superiour Authority
over all Laws and Princes of the World: He acknow|ledges
that your Maje&s;ty's Right of Government is <HI>Jure
Divino;</HI> and that therefore your Maje&s;ty is a ju&s;t Ex|ception
to the General Rules here laid down, your Autho|rity
is truly Sacred, and to your Maje&s;ty all the Powers of
<PB REF="4">
Men as well as their Actions pay a Just Homage; all Laws
made contradicting your Ab&s;olute Plea&s;ure, are <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI>
void in their own Nature, and whatever the greatest
Princes in the World act contrary to your Maje&s;ty's
Commands is ridiculous and impertinent, and their Sub|jects
ought to Di&s;obey them in it; your Maje&s;ty Reigns
with an Uncontroul'd Sovereignty in the very Hearts of
your Subjects; your Power is wholly De&s;potick, You
are truly accountable to none but your Maker, and your
Maje&s;ty's imnediate Adherence to his Sovereign Will,
gives the true Sanction to all your most exact Commands.</P>
<P>And yet your Maje&s;ty is far from being a Tyrant,
&s;ince at the &s;ame time that you Command the most Ab&s;olute
Obedience, &s;uch is the Demon&s;tration of your Royal Ju&s;tice,

Obedience to your Royal Authority, proceed most humbly

<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS <HI>Satyr</HI> had never been Publi&s;h'd, tho' &s;ome of it has been
a long time in being, had not the World &s;eem'd to be going
mad a &s;econd Time with the Error of <HI>Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience</HI> and
<HI>Non-Re&s;i&s;tance.</HI></P>
<P>The Title of <HI>Sacred</HI> has been added to that of <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> by the Complai|&s;ance
of a Party, who have all along been rather ready to talk of Loyalty,
than perform it, and who have &s;hown them&s;elves wonderful forward to
tax other People with Rebellion and Di&s;loyalty, in order to per&s;wade
their Princes to tru&s;t them in their mo&s;t emergent Occa&s;ions; but when
their King had the Misfortune to believe them hone&s;t, he paid too dear for
the Mi&s;take; for as they were the fir&s;t that prompted him to want their
A&s;&s;i&s;tance, they were al&s;o the fir&s;t that let him want it.</P>
<P>When our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour only talk'd of his approaching Sufferings, and
things were &s;een in Per&s;pective, they were all for dying with him, and
dying for him; but when the Band of Soldiers came, when <HI>Judas</HI> had
given the Signal, and their Lord was in the hands of his Enemies, <HI>They
all for&s;ook him and fled.</HI></P>
<P>Now 'tis a My&s;tery to me what the&s;e Gentlemen &s;tart this lo&s;t Doctrine
in the World again for, Have they any more Kings or Queens to betray?
Do they think any Prince in the World will ever be &s;o weak to take
their words again? a Man once perjur'd, no Ju&s;tice of the Peace will
ever admini&s;ter an Oath to him again; I believe I am in no danger of
being thought a <HI>Jacobite;</HI> but this I mu&s;t affirm, had I told K. <HI>James</HI> II.
'twas my Principle, that I ought not to re&s;i&s;t him, whatever vio|lence
he offered either to me or mine; That, as he was a King, his
Per&s;on was Sacred, and that if he oppre&s;s'd me in the Highe&s;t Man|ner;
nay, if he demanded my Life or E&s;tate by Force, I ought and
would Submit to him, and if I could not obey his Commands, I dur&s;t
not oppo&s;e his Puni&s;hment. Had I told him that he was King by inhe|rent
Birth-right, and his Power was <HI>Jure Divino;</HI> and therefore to re|&s;i&s;t
him in any thing, tho' never &s;o contrary to Rea&s;on or Ju&s;tice,
was to fight again&s;t God, and pur&s;uant to this Expo&s;ition of my Loyalty,
had I &s;worn the Oath of my Allegiance, and &s;ub&s;crib'd the Declaration;
if ever I took Arms again&s;t him, re&s;i&s;ted or oppos'd him, I &s;hould have
<PB N="ii" REF="6">
been guilty of a mo&s;t horrible Perjury, and Breach of Faith, and ought
never to be believ'd on my Word or Oath again.</P>
<P>As for me, I never under&s;tood my Loyalty, nor my Princes Au|thority,
in &s;uch an extended Sen&s;e; I never took any &s;uch Oath; and
therefore the joining with a Foreign Power in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, cannot
bear the &s;ame Con&s;truction: From &s;uch as were of this Opinion no King
can expect any other than whenever they attempt to ruin the Con&s;titu|tion,
&s;u&s;pend the Laws, and invade Property, they will never be obey'd;
the People will oppo&s;e &s;uch Oppre&s;&s;ion, and if they do not, 'tis for want
of Power, not for want of Will.</P>
<P>But in this Ca&s;e the weight of the Matter lies higher, if there be an Er|ror
in the re&s;i&s;ting Tyrannick Princes, 'tis in Principle, <HI>and that I never yet
&s;aw prov'd;</HI> but this is a meer Fraud, a Cheat put upon Princes, to encourage
them to be Tyrants on Pretence of Pa&s;&s;ive Submi&s;&s;ion; and that they
will, like <HI>I&s;&s;achar</HI>'s <HI>A&s;s,</HI> couch down under the Load, but when the Prince
taking them at at their word, ventures to lay the Burden on their Backs,
they ri&s;e up and kick him in the Face.</P>
<P>Of all the People in the World the&s;e Gentlemen &s;hould have done
with this old Sham; one Je&s;t at a time is enough for a Nation; one
King in an Age is enough to be cheated.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, Who are they for? <HI>Qui vive?</HI> What Party are they of? The
Church of <HI>England</HI> cannot but think they de&s;ign to banter her, that 'tis
a Whig-Plot to rip up old Matters; and that becau&s;e &s;he has once com|mitted
a Fault, they are always reproaching her with it: what tho' &s;he
was drawn in to own a Doctrine, and almo&s;t mix it with her Creed.
That when &s;he came to the Extremity, &s;he found would not hold Wa-Water,
What then? <HI>She was mi&s;taken,</HI> and 'tis no Di&s;grace or Reflection,
for any Church or any People or Per&s;on, when they find them&s;elves in an
Error, to own it, acknowledge and reform it: But to bring the &s;ame ob&s;o|lete
abdicated Principle in play again, and father it upon the Church
too, this can be nothing but a Combination to expo&s;e her.</P>
<P>What would any King of <HI>England</HI> think of the Men that &s;hould talk
this Language to them again, that &s;hould come to a Prince and &s;ay, Sir,
you need never fear any di&s;turbance from your Loyal Subjects the Church
of <HI>England,</HI> for whatever you do to them, they'll &s;ubmit, 'tis their
Principle, and they profe&s;s to believe that you are God's Vicegerent, ac|countable
to no Body; That you can do no Wrong; That your Crown
is held immediately of God, and Independent of the Laws; and there|fore
if your Occa&s;ions &s;hould require you to pinch them a little in their
Property, or di&s;pen&s;e with the Execution of the Laws, or the like, you
need not fear; the Church will always &s;tand by you with her Life and
Fortunes. What would a King of any Policy an&s;wer? I know not in|deed,
but if I were to make an An&s;wer for him it &s;hould be, <HI>Salisbury for
that; I'll not venture you:</HI> Shall any Man pretend to be a Friend to the
Church of <HI>England,</HI> and &s;et a foot again the Doctrine of the King's Ab|&s;olute
Power? If the King can do no Wrong, &s;omebody did the late
King a great deal of Wrong; Are evil Coun&s;ellors only puni&s;hable and
accountable for the Mi&s;managements of the Government? Where then
was the Ju&s;tice of this &s;ort of Churchmen, who flew in the Face of
their King, and never puni&s;h'd one of his Evil Coun&s;ellors? the Unac|countable
King was Dethroned, but his Accountable Mini&s;ters conti|nued
<PB N="iii" REF="7">
in play, and perhaps &s;ome of them bought their Employments with
his Money; Was king <HI>James</HI> treated like a Man <HI>that could do no Wrong,</HI>
and was not Accountable? Let tho&s;e who blame &s;ome People for the in|con&s;i&s;tency
of their Principles, reconcile if they can the Doctrine of Pa&s;|&s;ive-Obedience,
Non-Re&s;i&s;tance, and the Kings being not Accountable,
to the Practice of the High-Church of <HI>England</HI> in the Primitive Part
of the Late Revolution.</P>
<P>I think my &s;elf unconcern'd to enlarge here upon the incoherent Non|&s;en&s;e
that this Doctrine abounds with: The Church of <HI>England</HI> is bound
to &s;how it, to ju&s;tify her own Actings in Dethroning the Late King, and
it is a double <HI>Satyr</HI> upon the Church to pretend to vindicate it; it being
impo&s;&s;ible to reconcile the principle of Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience with the whole
Proceeding of the Late Revolution; if the Doctrine be true, <HI>if the King
can do no Wrong,</HI> if it be lawful on no Account whatever to re&s;i&s;t his Power,
or take up Arms in Defence of Liberty, Law, Religion or Property,
however oppre&s;s'd or endanger'd: The&s;e are &s;ome of the mo&s;t inevita|ble
Con&s;equences.</P>
<P>All the Nobility, Gentry, Clergy and Commons of <HI>England,</HI> who
either invited over, or join'd with the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and afterwards
con&s;ented to his being made King; all tho&s;e who &s;wore to him when he
was King, or that have &s;ince concur'd in the New E&s;tabli&s;hments, are
all Perjur'd Rebels; abominable, and to be abominated by all good
Men; are never to be tru&s;ted or believ'd again, neither <HI>when they Say,</HI>
nor <HI>when they Swear;</HI> the Crime ought never to be forgotten by Men,
nor without Repentance will be forgiven by Heaven; and till &s;ome Ge|neral
Act of Revocation be made by the whole United Authority of the
Kingdom, and Ju&s;tice done, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hould be &s;tigmatiz'd thro' all
the World as a Nation without Faith, Hone&s;ty, or Principle.</P>
<P>But if the People of <HI>England were in the Right,</HI> if the Depredations made
on the Ancient Rights of the Nation were a ju&s;t Foundation of &s;u&s;pend|ing
the General Allegiance, and applying to a foreign Prince, for the re|dre&s;&s;ing
the Nations Grievances; if the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation had both Rea&s;on
and Right to oblige the King to give the Laws their Cour&s;e and to let
every Man enjoy his Property: If the King is guilty of doing Wrong,
and both he and his Coun&s;ellors may be puni&s;h'd for the &s;ame; He by
making War again&s;t him, and they by the Axe and the Halter: In a
word, if the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment, of the Late King, or pre&s;ent Queen,
if the late or pre&s;ent Parliament are fix'd on any Ju&s;tice, Law or Rea|&s;on,
then this <HI>Satyr</HI> is ju&s;t, the Argument good, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> has
done no Wrong.</P>
<P>That Kings are not Kings <HI>Jure Divino,</HI> that when they break the
Laws, trample on Property, affront Religion, invade the Liberties of Na|tions,
<HI>and the like,</HI> they may be oppo&s;ed and re&s;i&s;ted by Force.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Publication of this <HI>Satyr</HI> has oblig'd me to con&s;ider of
Circum&s;tances, and as there are &s;ome Truths which do &s;uit all Times,
I have laid by a Second Volume; not that I think there is any thing
in it which is not as fit to &s;ee the Light as this; but I &s;ay of it, as the
Apo&s;tle in another Ca&s;e, <HI>I have many things to &s;ay, but you cannot bear
them now.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="8">
The &s;econd Part I confe&s;s was the fir&s;t in Action, and contains &s;ome
Characters, and &s;ome Enlargements on particular Tran&s;actions, which
for ought I know might not give Offence, and I am per&s;waded would
not from another Pen; neither had this been mention'd, but to let
tho&s;e Gentlemen, who may think this incompleat without it, know, That
no other rea&s;on prevented its running a further length, than tho&s;e
Prudentials, which I have not been over-apt to make u&s;e of in other
Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s I am &s;orry I &s;hould entertain any Fears that this Nation &s;hould
re&s;ent a thing wrote again&s;t a Principle, which is the greate&s;t Affront
to the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment that can po&s;&s;ibly be thought of; and nothing
but the Power of Prejudice could move &s;uch a thing, but &s;ince &s;ome Peo|ple
who are too apt to make Mi&s;con&s;truction, watch for my Mi&s;carriage,
I &s;acrifice the remaining part of this Work to their Malice, not at all at
the &s;ame time thinking they act either with Ju&s;tice or Honour.</P>
<P>I have concluded this Volume with a ju&s;t Acknowledgment in behalf
of my Native Country to the pre&s;ent and la&s;t Reign, for that vi&s;ible
Difference appearing in them between the Reign of Tyrants, and the
Reign of ju&s;t Princes, when Property is &s;ecur'd under ju&s;t Laws pun|ctually
ob&s;erv'd, and the Crown enjoying a due Extent, is neverthele&s;s
limitted by tho&s;e Laws; when the executive Power acknowledging the
ju&s;t Superiority of the Law, regulates it &s;elf according to the true in|tent
and meaning of all Power; <HI>The Publick Good.</HI></P>
<P>If any are &s;o weak as to &s;uppo&s;e this is a <HI>satyr</HI> again&s;t Kingly Govern|ment,
and wrote to expo&s;e Monarchy; I think I &s;hould &s;ufficiently
an&s;wer &s;o &s;ooli&s;h a Piece of Raillery, by &s;aying only, <HI>they are mi&s;taken.</HI></P>
<P>But becau&s;e &s;ome Men require more explicit An&s;wers than others; I
take the Liberty to declare, that I not only now, but on all Occa&s;ions,
when there was le&s;s need of vindicating my Opinion, have declared my
Belief to be, that a Monarchy according to the pre&s;ent Con&s;titution limit|ted
by Parliament, and <HI>dependent upon Law,</HI> is not only the be&s;t Govern|ment
in the World; but al&s;o <HI>the be&s;t for this Nation in particular,</HI> mo&s;t
&s;uitable to the <HI>Genius</HI> of the People, and the <HI>Circum&s;tances</HI> of the whole
Body; a <HI>Commonwealth</HI> can never &s;uit a Nation where there is <HI>&s;o Illu|&s;trious
a Nobility,</HI> and &s;o numerous a <HI>Gentry;</HI> the Emulations, Factions and
Parties of &s;uch Men, are apt to be too turbulent for &s;uch a Government.
If we were a Nation of <HI>meer Plebeii,</HI> all Commoners, or the like, other
Arguments might be us'd: But as it is, I am fully per&s;waded of the be|nefit
of a Monarchical Government to the whole Body; and I mu&s;t
tell the Objector, no Man is likelier to be a faithful Subject to a Mo|narchy,
than he who is convinc'd in his Judgment of its being,
not only a Good Government, but <HI>the best for the Publick Benefit.</HI></P>
<P>But this I can defend without being of opinion, That Kings came
down from Heaven <HI>with Crowns upon their Heads,</HI> and the People were
all born <HI>with Sadles on their Backs;</HI> I own I am none of <HI>I&s;&s;achar</HI>'s <HI>A&s;&s;es,</HI>
nor &s;hould I be willing to be govern'd by the <HI>Czar of Mu&s;covy;</HI> I don't
think if a King wanted to walk cro&s;s a dirty High Way, his Maje&s;ty
might command 20 or 30 of the Heads of his Followers to be cut off to
make Steppings for him, that he might not dirty his <HI>Sacred Shoes.</HI> I pro|fe&s;s
<PB N="v" REF="9">
my &s;elf a dutyful Subject to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and in that word
I mean to what Head &s;oever on which <HI>the Parliament of England</HI> &s;hall place
the Crown; but I own no King who &s;hall ever wear it without Con|&s;ent
of Parliament, no King who &s;hall after &s;uch Con&s;ent employ the Powers
of it <HI>to the De&s;truction of the Law,</HI> and Con&s;titution of the Nation, who
&s;hall invade the Property of the Subject, invert the Publick Ju&s;tice, or
overthrow the Religion and Liberty of <HI>England;</HI> &s;uch a Prince is a
Tyrant, and <HI>may be depo&s;ed</HI> by the <HI>&s;ame Power</HI> that plac'd him upon the
Throne; any Hereditary Succe&s;&s;ion, Pretended Divine Right, Supreme
Power, or other Matter, Cau&s;e or Thing <HI>to the contrary in any wi&s;e not|with&s;tanding.</HI></P>
<P>The Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> Con&s;i&s;ting of the King, Lords and Com|mons,
are to me the Supreme Channel of Power, the Great Collective
Body in Miniature; their Right has a much fairer Character of Divinity
upon it than the Regal, being deriv'd from their Propriety in the Free|hold;
the Land is their own, this I&s;land is their own, and every Man
has a Right of Government, who has a a Right of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Kings, <HI>&s;ay our Champions of Ab&s;olute Power,</HI> have their Authority from God,
<HI>and from him only;</HI> of &s;uch Gentlemen it would be well to ask &s;ome &s;uch
Que&s;tions as the&s;e; When they receive this Power? And what Kings are
they have it? If all Kings have it, then the U&s;urper who murthers the
Right Heir has it, and Crookback <HI>Richard</HI> had it, and was King <HI>Jure
Divino;</HI> and what was <HI>Henry</HI> VII. then? to take up Arms again&s;t a
Rightful, Lawful Prince, who had his Power immediately from the Mo&s;t
High, and was accountable to none but him? If U&s;urpers have not this
Divine Right, Where then will you find it? And what Nation has a
Prince who&s;e Line did not begin at &s;ome Period of U&s;urpation, or in the
Injury of the Right of another; or, in &s;hort, by &s;ome unju&s;t Suc|ce&s;&s;ion?</P>
<P>If a U&s;urper then has no Right, he has not a Divine Right; if he
has any Right, he is no more an U&s;urper.</P>
<P>They that will make no Di&s;tinction between Per&s;on and Power in this
Ca&s;e, would do well to tell us where this Wonder of a King is born: let
them &s;how us this Star, that we may go and wor&s;hip; I think we may
fairly challenge them to &s;how us a Line of Kings in the World, that is
not full of U&s;urpations.</P>
<P>But if we grant <HI>this Divine Right,</HI> and particularly grant it in our own
Line, which I believe is as clear from &s;uch Interruptions as any in the
World can pretend to.</P>
<P>Then a certain Univer&s;ity which burnt the Books of our Late Phana|tical
Authors concerning the Di&s;tinctions, between the Per&s;on and the
Power of the King, &s;hould now burn the new Di&s;tinctions between a
King <HI>de Jure,</HI> and a King <HI>de Facto,</HI> and &s;hould now burn all their Pane|gyricks
and Pa&s;torals, their Speeches, flattering Declamations, printed by
Church-Authority, and made in Prai&s;e of King <HI>William,</HI> and on the Death
of Queen <HI>Mary.</HI></P>
<P>They would do well to acquaint the World how he came to be King,
and her pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty to be his Succe&s;&s;or; and if K. <HI>James</HI> had a Divine
Right, which I believe he had as much as ever any King of <HI>England</HI> had,
which is ju&s;t none at all; and if he was accountable to no Body, how
<PB N="vi" REF="10">
the Church will an&s;wer trampling on that Divine Right, and bringing
in a Foreign Power to que&s;tion him for Malver&s;ation of Government.</P>
<P>Will they tell us at the <HI>Boyn,</HI> Did they fight again&s;t his Per&s;on or his
Power? Did they there di&s;tingui&s;h between the Man and the King?
Did they not in Monthly Fa&s;ts and Daily Prayers, give God thanks for
the Peoples victory over their Late Monarch? Did they not pray for
Succe&s;s again&s;t him, and make Bonfires when they had it?</P>
<P>Every Panegyrick upon King <HI>William,</HI> was a Ballad upon King <HI>James,</HI>
and a Lampoon upon Divine Right; if this Doctrine have any Truth in it,
<HI>the&s;e Gentlemen have but little in them;</HI> and the Church of <HI>England</HI> has
more to an&s;wer for, than all the Churches in the Chri&s;tian World.</P>
<P>But &s;he is wi&s;er, the Doctrine of Government and Obedience is &s;ettled
by the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and confirm'd by Parliament; and 'tis an
unaccountable Affront to both, but particularly to the Church, to pre|tend
to father this Doctrine upon her, when with Arms in her hands
&s;he has declar'd her &s;elf to the contrary.</P>
<P>The Church of <HI>England</HI> has not only depo&s;ed the King that pretended
<HI>to this empty Title,</HI> and that encourag'd this Doctrine, but has depo&s;ed
the very Doctrine it &s;elf; and condemn'd it as ab&s;urd and ridiculous,
and this both by Practice and Profe&s;&s;ion; and how &s;hould the Church of
<HI>England</HI> do any otherwi&s;e? when her very Foundation &s;tands <HI>upon this
Depo&s;ing Power:</HI> Has &s;he not practis'd it to &s;ecure her own Foundation,
and ju&s;tified it it as a Nece&s;&s;ity very well to be defended? What greater
Argument was given for inviting the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> to come over with
an Army? and what greater Argument can be given, <HI>than that</HI> King
<HI>James,</HI> mov'd by Popi&s;h Coun&s;els, and undermin'd and invaded the
Church of <HI>England?</HI>&mdash;This was the univer&s;al Complaint, the Fact was
true beyond Contradiction; the Attempt was not denied even by tho&s;e
that were concern'd in it: For this the Church of <HI>England</HI> had recour&s;e
to a Foreign Power: for this &s;he took Arms, and Fled for recour&s;e <HI>to her
Native Right,</HI> and to the <HI>People of England,</HI> who at all times were her
Refuge, and who ever will be &s;o.</P>
<P>Nor is this the fir&s;t time the People of <HI>England</HI> have done thus by a great
many, the Barons Wars are &s;tanding Records of the ju&s;t Title the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation had to their Antient Privileges, and by Con&s;equence, to
defend them when invaded even by their Kings them&s;elves; the &s;everal
Contraventions of Treaties, Breaches of Oaths, and Inva&s;ions of
Right in King <HI>John</HI> again&s;t the Liberties of his Subjects, we find
ju&s;tified the Treaty they made with Prince <HI>Lewis,</HI> Son to the King of
<HI>France,</HI> who the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nobility and Gentry invited over, to free them
from the Male-admini&s;tration of the Tyrant, and whom they join'd with
all their Forces at his Arrival, defeating their King by his A&s;&s;i&s;tance in
the Battle near <HI>Lincoln.</HI></P>
<P>And after the Death of King <HI>John,</HI> when the Earl Mar&s;hal in a
Speech per&s;waded the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nobility to accept of the young Prince
<HI>Henry</HI> Son of King <HI>John</HI> to be their King; he recommends him not bare|ly
as his Son, or having a Divine Right in his Succe&s;&s;ion, but as he had
by his tender Years been capable of no part in the Evil Government of
his Father, he de&s;ires them to pity his Youth, and not deprive him
<PB N="vii" REF="11">
for the Sin of his Father: Upon which they unanimou&s;ly made him
King.</P>
<P>I know no Parallel Ca&s;e &s;o exactly Suits the calling over the Prince of
<HI>Orange,</HI> as this calling over Prince <HI>Lewis:</HI> Nor was it from any &s;en&s;e of
King <HI>John</HI>'s Title, or their want of a ju&s;t Right to Depo&s;e him, that
they did not actually declare <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>France</HI> their King: But fir&s;t K. <HI>John</HI>
did not Abdicate and leave the Kingdom, and con&s;equently the Throne
vacant; and had not King <HI>James</HI> done &s;o in too much ha&s;te for him, it
had been very difficult to have declar'd King <HI>William</HI> during his Life;
but the <HI>French</HI> began to be in&s;olent and haughty, and rendred them|&s;elves
intolerable to the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> which alienated the minds of the Peo|ple,
and e&s;pecially of the Gentry from them, and &s;erv'd to ha&s;ten the ac|knowledging
the Son of their late King.</P>
<P>Nor had it been any Que&s;tion, but that had King <HI>James</HI> left a Son in
<HI>England</HI> behind him a Prote&s;tant, and claiming the Crown, he would
have had it&mdash;But had the Birth of his Son been unque&s;tion'd here, his
carrying him away into <HI>France</HI> certainly depriv'd him as effectually as it
did his Father.</P>
<P>The next General In&s;tance of the Peoples taking up Arms in <HI>England</HI>
again&s;t their Sovereign, is in the time of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. I know there
were Wars in <HI>England</HI> on various Occa&s;ions between the Hou&s;es of <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI>
and <HI>York,</HI> be&s;ides the Quarrel between <HI>Rich.</HI> 3. and <HI>Heb.</HI> D. of <HI>Richmond;</HI>
but the&s;e were rather Di&s;putes of Rival Titles to the Crown, than uni|ver&s;al
De&s;ertions of the oppre&s;t People from their Subjection to their in|vading
Princes.</P>
<P>But examining the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. you find none of the
Nations either of <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> or <HI>Ireland,</HI> di&s;puting the Legality of
his Title to Govern, but the Legality of his Governing&mdash;And therefore
with Submi&s;&s;ion to &s;ome Gentlemen, who will not bear the Compari&s;on
between the Late Revolution, and the Parliament War, I mu&s;t &s;ay, that
di&s;tingui&s;hing rightly, the Compari&s;on is very ju&s;t, and the Parts have
an exact Connexion, &s;o far as it was a Parliament-War.</P>
<P>It is therefore for want of di&s;tingui&s;hing rightly of the &s;everal Parts
of tho&s;e Tran&s;actions, which Cau&s;es the Beginners of one Action, to en|title
Heaven to the Wonders of the Revolution, and the other fall under
the Scandal of Rebellion.</P>
<P>I know &s;ome People will not bear the Compari&s;on, and &s;ometimes are
apt to let their Patience for&s;ake them when 'tis attempted: but if
they return to their Temper, be pleas'd to let their Judgments be gui|ded
by the Nature of things, and the true Hi&s;tory of tho&s;e Times guide
them, they will &s;ee le&s;s difference here than perhaps they imagine.</P>
<P>To clear up this Point, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to examine the Originals of
both the&s;e Wars.</P>
<P>The Complaints of the People in tho&s;e days again&s;t the King's Inva|&s;ion
of their Rights, are not only acknowledg'd to be ju&s;t by my Lord
<HI>Clarendon,</HI> who &s;ufficiently blames the Conduct of that King; but even
by that King him&s;elf, when he pa&s;s'd the Famous Petition of Right, a
thing in its own Nature exactly the &s;ame with the Declaration of Right
at the Revolution: The words of the King at the pa&s;&s;ing that Petition,
which was converted into a Law, were, <HI>Soit Droit comme it e&s;t De&s;ire.</HI>
<PB N="viii" REF="12">
Let Right be done you, as you Demand&mdash;A plain Acknowledgment,
not only that it was their Right they demanded; but al&s;o that they had
a Right to demand it.</P>
<P>The &s;everal Conce&s;&s;ions at other Times made by the King, <HI>who&s;e Mi&s;|fortune
was &s;ometimes to grant too much, and at other times to little,</HI> were plain
Acknowledgments, that he had given them good occa&s;ion to complain.</P>
<P>'Twas for the&s;e Rights afterwards invaded, that the Parliament and
the King unhappily differ'd; I won't trouble the Reader with the De|bate,
who began the War, who run things to needle&s;s Extremities, or
whether both Sides, <HI>Led by England</HI>'s <HI>Fate,</HI> did not incur the blame of
being too blind to the Calamities that en&s;ued&mdash;But I no way excu&s;e
what the Con&s;equence of the&s;e things was in excu&s;ing the fir&s;t Contrivers
and Beginners of them from having the lea&s;t hand in, or De&s;ign of bring|ing
things to the Extremities that follow'd.</P>
<P>There were a great many hone&s;t Gentlemen in that Parliament, who,
tho' they thought them&s;elves oblig'd in Duty to their Po&s;terity, to con|tend
with the utmo&s;t Vehemence for the Liberty of their Country, yet
had no manner of De&s;ign to Dethrone the Monarchy, overturn and &s;ub|vert
the Con&s;titution, and bring this Nation under the Tyrranny of a
Standing Army.</P>
<P>As to the Death of the King, their future Behaviour te&s;tified for them,
both in their Treatment of the King, while he was in their Power, and
their Re&s;entment of the U&s;age he met with when he was taken out of
their Power, by the Soldiers, That they were innocent &s;o much as of
the Thought.</P>
<P>I cannot deny what I have &s;o often affirm'd in another Ca&s;e, which
I &s;ay is parallel to this, that from the time they took up Arms, every
Battle fought, every &s;hot made, every Gun fired, was a tacit killing the
King, and that &s;o every Member of that Parliament had a hand in kil|ling
the King.</P>
<P>But when the&s;e Gentlemen had brought the War to Conclu&s;ion, and
had the King in their Power, What did they do? did they not according to
their Treaty with the <HI>Scots,</HI> treat him with Freedom, Honour and Safety?
Did they not &s;eriou&s;ly apply them&s;elves to a Treaty with him for the &s;et|tling
the Nation, upon &s;uch a Foundation as they thought agreeable
to what they had fought for? And did they not con&s;ent to re&s;tore him to his
Crown and Dignity, and to return to their Obedience upon &s;uch Condi|tions
as were &s;uitable to their fir&s;t Demands? and had they not gone &s;o
far, and the King &s;o far complyed, as that they voted the King's Con|ce&s;&s;ions
a &s;ufficient Ground of a Treaty?</P>
<P>Thus far I do &s;till in&s;i&s;t upon it, That the Parallel between the <HI>Civil</HI>
War, or <HI>Parliament</HI> War, or <HI>Rebellion,</HI> call it which you will; and the
Inviting over, Joyning with, and Taking up Arms under the Prince of
<HI>Orange,</HI> again&s;t King <HI>James,</HI> &s;eems to me to be very exact, the drawing
&s;uch a Parallel very ju&s;t, and the Foundation proceeding, and I&s;&s;ue ju&s;t
the &s;ame.</P>
<P>I have nothing to do here with the Con&s;equences of the Action, the
Parliament-Men and others concern'd in that War, could no more have
it in their De&s;ign to de&s;troy the Per&s;on of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. or the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Gentry that invited over the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> have it in their De&s;ign to
<PB N="ix" REF="13">
form the Revolution that follow, then either of them could fore&s;ee the
&s;ub&s;equent I&s;&s;ues of their Undertaking, before it was begun.</P>
<P>Neither of them can deny, the De&s;truction of their King, might for
ought they knew be the Con&s;equences of the War, or by an alternate
Fortune, their own de&s;truction might be the &s;ame: But the nece&s;&s;ity
of putting both to the hazard was certainly equal, and the Lawfulne&s;s
equal by the &s;ame Con&s;equence; and I cannot go from it, that both the
&s;aid Wars were rai&s;ed upon the &s;ame Foundation, <HI>viz.</HI> the Crown, in|vading
the Laws and Liberties of the Subject. How any People can then
<HI>Defend the inviting over the Prince of Orange,</HI> to check the Inva&s;ions of
King <HI>James</HI> II. and at the &s;ame time condemn the taking Arms again&s;t
the Inva&s;ions of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. remains to be re&s;olv'd.</P>
<P>If they will prove that the Inva&s;ions of Right, Property, and Engli&s;h
Laws were not equal, or proportionably &s;o; nor the Actions of both
equally illegal, they mu&s;t deny what the Parties them&s;elves have ac|knowledg'd
by their attempting to undo them again when too late.</P>
<P>If they will prove that one Prince had <HI>more Right to impo&s;e</HI> upon his
Subjects than the other, and that the Subjects <HI>then</HI> ought to bear what
the Subjects <HI>now</HI> ought to re&s;ent, the Ca&s;e will alter, and I &s;hall pati|ently
expect &s;ome &s;uch Arguments to ju&s;tify this: But if I am di&s;ap|pointed
in that, I &s;hall cea&s;e to wonder, when I reflect that Impo&s;&s;ibi|lities
are not to be expected.</P>
<P>But all the&s;e things are an&s;wered by one &s;ort of Men, and they are
&s;uch as argue, That neither of the&s;e Actions are ju&s;tifiable at all; That
the King receiving his Authority from no human Sanction, but from God
alone, is accountable to none <HI>but Him;</HI> That <HI>his Right</HI> is Inherent, <HI>his
Per&s;on</HI> Sacred, and the Obedience of his Subjects <HI>a Debt of Religion,</HI> in
Obedience to the Commands of God; and con&s;equently mu&s;t be with|out
Re&s;erve.</P>
<P>To &s;uch I am not &s;peaking in the Preface, <HI>but in the Book;</HI> and &s;hall
refer them to it; the <HI>Satyr</HI> is theirs: This Part is directed to another
&s;ort of Folk, and therefore is wrote in another Dialect; I only ask
the&s;e, what is all this to the Parallel I draw between the Parliament War,
and <HI>the taking up Arms</HI> again&s;t King <HI>James,</HI> both which were begun
upon the &s;ame Foundation, and again&s;t the &s;ame Per&s;on, on the &s;ame
Pretence?</P>
<P>Both are expre&s;s'd and de&s;crib'd by the &s;ame Phra&s;e or Form of Words;
both are the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation or Parliament taking Arms, upon the account
of their Liberties invaded, and Laws di&s;pen&s;ed with, by the Arbitrary
Will of their Princes.</P>
<P>Both are the Subjects taking Arms again&s;t their Sovereign, which if
it be not lawful on any account, confirms the Parallel, and both &s;hall
join in meriting the Title of a Rebellion; if it may be lawful on any Ac|count,
then it will only remain to examine, whether of the two can put
in the faire&s;t Claim to the Right of taking Arms for their Liberty?</P>
<P>And not to enter here into the Melancholy Exmination of the Particu|lars,
I leave it to any Body to examine, whether the Inva&s;ion of Liberty,
without Con&s;ent in Parliament, di&s;pen&s;ing with Laws, di&s;continuing
Parliaments, and oppre&s;&s;ing the Subject in the Reign of King <HI>Charles,</HI>
were not equal to the &s;ame, or &s;uch like Articles, under the Admini&s;tra|tion
<PB N="x" REF="14">
of King <HI>James</HI> II. and let but the Advocates of this Matter deal im|partially;
and whenever they bring a Hi&s;torical Parallel between the
Reigns, I fear not an effectual Confirmation of my Propo&s;ition?</P>
<P>I cannot but remind my Readear to do me Ju&s;tice, for many are
they that catch at the Sound of things, and mi&s;place wo$$s; but
let them <HI>take me right,</HI> and fix the &s;ame Periods of the &s;everal Actions
as I do; the fir&s;t to the King being &s;orcibly taken out of the hands
of the Parliament, by a <HI>Juncto</HI> of the Army, when <HI>His Maje&s;ty's Con|ce&s;&s;ions</HI>
on one hand, and <HI>his Subjects Conce&s;&s;ions</HI> on the other, had
brought a happy Peace in view, which View was one Rea&s;on that ex|a&s;perated
the Army, and to prevent which they thus flew in the
Faces of their Ma&s;ters, and turn'd that Force upon them, which
they ought to have employ'd in their Defence, and by their Or|der:
The other Period they mu&s;t fix at the time of the Retreat of King
<HI>James,</HI> and the Convention of E&s;tates being A&s;&s;embled to &s;ettle the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>
Government, and to re&s;tore the Liberties of the People, which the
Arbitrary Proceedings of that King had ruin'd and &s;ubverted.</P>
<P>Hitherto both Parties acted upon the &s;ame Foundation, from the &s;ame
and equally to be ju&s;tified Principles, and kept to their declar'd De&s;igns.</P>
<P>What happen'd in both ca&s;es &s;ub&s;equent to the&s;e Periods, may be rec|koned
among the unfore&s;een, and remote Con&s;equences, which no Man
could have been charg'd with projecting in the fir&s;t De&s;ign, and are not
at all concern'd in the Di&s;pute.</P>
<P>I no more believe that the fir&s;t Rai&s;ers of the Civil War, <HI>&s;uppo&s;e the
Parliament Agre&s;&s;ors,</HI> ever de&s;ign'd to have brought the King to a for|mal
Trial, and to the Block as a Criminal, or fore&s;aw any &s;uch Event
in that War; than the fir&s;t Signers of the Invitation to the Prince of
<HI>Orange</HI> could fore&s;ee or de&s;ign King <HI>James</HI>'s Abdication, and the future
Settlement of the Crown: Nor can any Man form a rational Conjecture
from whence, to make it probable, that either of the&s;e could be fore&s;een
on either hand.</P>
<P>As the Chances of War and the various Succe&s;&s;es of Actions of this
Nature are unaccountable, and Men that act on &s;uch Occa&s;ions are an&s;we|rable
for the Con&s;equences of &s;uch Actions, whether fore&s;een or no: <HI>So
indeed,</HI> either &s;ide are accountable for the things that follow'd; and how
ju&s;tifiable both are, I refer to Hi&s;tory and this Book; but the Bu&s;ine&s;s I
am here upon, is, whether the Ca&s;es are alike, or no, and I profe&s;s not to
be able to &s;ee the Difference.</P>
<P>The War in both Articles began with the &s;ame Pretences, on the
&s;ame Principles, in the &s;ame Manner, the Complainers alledge the &s;ame
thing, the Kings acted almo&s;t the &s;ame things, and the I&s;&s;ue brought forth
the &s;ame event, <HI>viz.</HI> Depo&s;ing the King.</P>
<P>What Difference there was in the &s;ub&s;equent Proceedings, I &s;ay again
is nothing to the purpo&s;e I am upon: nor can I concern my &s;elf to en|quire,
whether Suffering of Death or Exile were mo&s;t grievous, or mo&s;t
Criminal; tho&s;e things admit of Di&s;pute, and are <HI>too &s;ad to make merry
with;</HI> but thus far I think the Parallel is very plain, and cannot be de|ny'd,
that the Rea&s;on of the War is the &s;ame, and one cannot be ju&s;tified
without the other.</P>
<P>And yet, &s;hould I enter inro the Enquiry, which of the two Kings had
<PB N="xi" REF="15">
the wor&s;t Treatment; I confe&s;s my &s;elf at &s;ome Lo&s;s to determine; and
therefore to tho&s;e Gentlemen that are angry at an Expre&s;&s;ion of mine
in another place, concerning the Difference between <HI>Dry</HI> and <HI>Wet</HI> Matyr|dome;
I'take the Liberty to &s;ay.</P>
<P>That either re&s;pecting the Suffering it &s;elf;</P>
<P>Or, The manner preceding it&mdash;If I might be at liberty to &s;ay
what I think; 'tis really my Opinion, That King <HI>James</HI> went thro' the
mo&s;t, and with more cutting Aggravations; and let the Cen&s;urers of this
do me Ju&s;tice, I fear incurring no blame from Men of impartial, di&s;cern|ing,
unbya&s;s'd Judgments.</P>
<P>It is not material to enquire into the Cau&s;es here, or what brought ei|ther
of the&s;e Unfortunate Princes into Di&s;tre&s;s; but I am &s;peaking as to
the Weight of their Sufferings, re&s;pecting them&s;elves, and the Guilt of the
Per&s;ons, re&s;pecting the In&s;truments.</P>
<P>1. As to the Weight of the Sufferings, I am clear in it; tho' in this I
pretend but to &s;peak my own Opinion, that all the formidable Terrors of
the Axe and the Scaffold, with their preceding Violences, I mean from
the time the King fell into the hands of the Army to his Death, could
not amount to a Ballance of the Exile, the In&s;ults, the un&s;ufferable
Treachery of Friends, and this added to the length of Time, which the
late King had to &s;truggle with in his Depo&s;ing.</P>
<P>Death is an immediate Gate of Deliverance to &s;uch Pre&s;&s;ures as are be|yond
the Power of Fle&s;h and Blood to &s;upport; and tho' the Weight
of all &s;orts mu&s;t be very heavy, under which King <HI>Charles</HI> the fir&s;t fell,
yet it had &s;ome Alleviations which this had not.</P>
<P>1. He had the Satisfaction to &s;ee, that his numerous Friends had &s;tuck
to him faithfully; that tho' he was over-powered by his Enemies, yet
he had thou&s;ands of his Faithful Subjects had &s;pent their Blood in his
Service, and the Remnant continued true to him to the la&s;t, only want|ed
Ability.</P>
<P>2. He &s;aw the very People who&s;e Power had reduc'd him, look'd on
the Violences he then &s;uffered with the utmo&s;t Regret; That it was a
new undi&s;covered Mine, &s;et on fire from below, under which the whole
Con&s;titution at that time &s;eem'd to lie buryed as well as he; and that
the very Men who took up Arms again&s;t him for their Liberty, yet ab|horr'd
the extending their Victory to his De&s;truction.</P>
<P>3. Had he thought fit, <HI>as few Princes but he would have &s;tuck at it,</HI>
to have abandon'd the Bi&s;hops, he might long before that have been
Re-e&s;tabli&s;h'd.</P>
<P>Other Circum&s;tances I omit, which I might bring to prove the Allevi|tions
of Sorrow on his Side much greater than on King <HI>James</HI>'s: But to
come to the other Side.</P>
<P>The late King &s;aw him&s;elf betray'd by his neare&s;t Friends, abandon'd
of tho&s;e very Men that had led him by the hand into the Snare; a Uni|ver&s;al
Defection, the Exceptions in which were very few; no Body to
&s;tand by him; tho&s;e very Men that had &s;worn to a Pa&s;&s;ive Ab&s;olute Sub|mi&s;&s;ion,
and taught it to others, <HI>in Arms again&s;t him.</HI></P>
<P>He &s;aw him&s;elf &s;o entirely de&s;erted, that he found him&s;elf incapable
of having, <HI>as we &s;ay,</HI> one day for it, or an Opportunity of &s;triking one Blow
for his Crown.</P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="16">
He &s;aw him&s;elf to&s;s'd off from his Throne by tho&s;e very People, who
in the Reign before, were mo&s;t zealous to place him there; he &s;aw
tho&s;e that flattered him with the Sanction of his Per&s;on, and his deriving
his Authority from God alone, arm'd with Guns and Swords, violating
that very Per&s;on they pretended to hallow; tho&s;e that told him he was
accountable to none, calling him to an Account for even the very things
he had acted by their Advice, and which they had been the Engins to
draw him into.</P>
<P>Add to this, that he &s;aw him&s;elf driven out of his Kingdom, by a Force
he had the lea&s;t Rea&s;on to apprehend; his own Children &s;et upon his
Throne by that National Authority, which he had too much con|temn'd,
and all po&s;&s;ible Indignities put upon his Per&s;on by the Common
People.</P>
<P>E&s;caping the Tumult and In&s;ults of the Rabble, he fled into <HI>France;</HI>
there he liv'd to &s;ee his Powerful Ally not able to re&s;tore him, the Royal
Navy of <HI>France</HI> de&s;troy'd in his Defence, and at la&s;t the mo&s;t bloody War
that ever <HI>Europe</HI> &s;aw, began on his Account, but ended without any Relief
and his Patron of <HI>France</HI> forc'd to make Peace without him.</P>
<P>He &s;aw his Rival King <HI>William</HI> e&s;tabli&s;h'd at home, acknowledged from
abroad, and go home triumphing over his De&s;perate Fortunes; and all
the&s;e Severities making Deep Wounds in his Soul by the continuance of
11 years, without pro&s;pect of Recovery.</P>
<P>Let any Man ask me, if the Axe and the Scaffold had half the intole|rable
Weight of this Burthen&mdash;I cannot but think I have &s;ufficiently
demon&s;trated that the la&s;t, as the pa&s;&s;ive Part of Valour, as the Greate&s;t,
&s;uffered mo&s;t; as to the active Part, and the Per&s;ons afflicting, to me it is
&s;till the &s;ame, and the Guilt of the la&s;t rather exceeds that of the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>And here let me enter a due Caution; I do not by heightning the
Guilt of the la&s;t, Attempt to le&s;&s;en the Guilt of the fir&s;t, nor am I con|cern'd
in it.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t was all Tumult, Army, and Rabble; their Violence was equal
on the Nation, as on the Per&s;on of the King; they Dethron'd not the
King only, but the Con&s;titution; they beheaded the very Govenment;
Government as well as the Governour;&mdash;It was an unaccountable
Torrent, like a Flood from the Sea driven upon the Land by &s;ome &s;trong
Tempe&s;t, which when it has forc'd its way over all Bounds, and broke
down all the legal Banks and Oppo&s;ition, Drowns the Country, and
many innocent People are de&s;troy'd by the violence of it; but when
it has &s;pent its Force, returns with the like Fury and Impetuo&s;ity,
and at la&s;t ends in its Native Ocean; and &s;o did this.</P>
<P>That the&s;e violences were illegal, rebellious, bloody, and barbarous,
and that the King and many others of the be&s;t Families in <HI>England,</HI>

Hypocri&s;y of the&s;e Men, who did all this Violence to King
<HI>James,</HI> after they, <HI>the very &s;ame individual Per&s;ons,</HI> had prompted him to
all the unhappy Steps he took, ju&s;tified the very Arbitrary Proceedings
and illegal Practices they afterwards expos'd him for; nay, and &s;ome
of them the very In&s;truments which a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in acting them.</P>
<P>This un&s;ufferable Treachery in the People he tru&s;ted, aggravated their
Crime and his &s;uffering, beyond all that I think can be &s;aid of K. <HI>Charles</HI> I.</P>
<P>To &s;ay they did not murther him, is to &s;ay nothing, his Share, <HI>as to
them I mean,</HI> I think exceeded that of his Fathers, and if their Crimes will
admit of Compari&s;ons, certainly the la&s;t exceeded all that ever went
before them.</P>
<P>They did not try him and cut off his Head; That had been <HI>&V;ne coup
de Grace,</HI> they were 11 Years a Murthering of him, and he langui&s;h'd
all that while under their Treachery: And this is what I mean by the
<HI>Dry</HI> and <HI>Wet</HI> Martyrdom; and if the Gentlemen that Object again&s;t the
Compari&s;on plea&s;e to enter into the Particulars, they will find the Dry,
Starving, Betraying Martyrdom of King <HI>James,</HI> exceed the other.</P>
<P>Not that I think the Revolution founded upon any thing of this
Treachery, however a&s;&s;i&s;tant it was to bring the Revolution to pa&s;s,
nor do I argue that the Depo&s;ing King <HI>James</HI> was an unju&s;t Action, be|cau&s;e
it came as the Con&s;equence of the People of <HI>England</HI> taklng Arms
to defend their Liberties and Laws which were manife&s;tly invaded&punc;</P>
<P>But that re&s;pects tho&s;e People who &s;uffered by, and complain'd of tho&s;e
Inva&s;ions and Oppre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>For King <HI>James</HI> was not Depo&s;ed by tho&s;e, otherwi&s;e than eventually;
the&s;e were the Cau&s;es of all this; the&s;e Men led him into this Snare,
&s;wore their Allegiance to him upon ab&s;olute re&s;igning Terms; &s;ign'd a
Licen&s;e to him to be a Tyrant, <HI>as far as concern'd their part:</HI> They own'd
him as a Monarch <HI>Jure Divino,</HI> of Right inherent, Power ab&s;olute, and
Per&s;on Sacred, and when they had thus led him to the Gulph, they pu&s;h'd
him in, and not only abandon'd him, but pur&s;ued him with the &s;ame
Violence they had condemn'd other for before; one and all, they drew
the Sword again&s;t the Lord's Anointed, call'd him to an Account whom
they had &s;worn to as Unaccountable, and ruin'd him for tho&s;e very
Actions they had thru&s;t him upon before.</P>
<P>After they had made his Ca&s;e de&s;perate, and pu&s;h'd him upon things
&s;o unju&s;tifiable and unaccountable, that forc'd even his be&s;t Friend$,
and his own Hou&s;hold and Children to fly from him; how did the&s;e Men
defend him? how did they &s;tand by him with their Lives and Fortunes,
things they had &s;o often Bantered him with; How did they that addre&s;s'd
him with Thanks for his Standing Army to Day, to Morrow addre&s;s
the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> with perhaps like Hypocritical Thanks for re&s;cuing
them from the Slavery and Tyranny of the &s;ame Standing Army? How
did they, that in their frequent Addre&s;&s;es <HI>to &s;tand by him</HI> with their Lives
and Fortunes, indeed &s;tand by and look on at his De&s;truction, re&s;erving
tho&s;e Lives and Fortunes to cheat his Succe&s;&s;or with?</P>
<P>Thus they put him to <HI>Dry</HI> Martyrdom, drove him from his Throne,
&s;ent him to &s;eek Safety, and even Sub&s;i&s;tence from Foreign Courts&punc;
to live an exil'd Stranger in other Countries&mdash;And peri&s;h under all the
Mi&s;eries of a Bani&s;hment, that, to a great Mind, is wor&s;e than Death.</P>
<P><PB N="xiv" REF="18">
To &s;ay he was entertain'd and receiv'd well abroad, is nothing to them,
to the utmo&s;t of their Power, they &s;tarv'd him; and thus they murther'd
him, as I call it; and what he endur'd by their Treachery, both as to
the Per&s;on &s;uffering, and Per&s;ons procuring, was in this much greater
than that of his Father.</P>
<P>As to the re&s;t of the Nation, &s;uch as never con&s;ented to arbitrary In|va&s;ions
of Liberty, arbitrary Di&s;pen&s;ings with the Laws, and Arbitrary
Governing by an Army, they had really no other hand in the late King's Di|&s;a&s;ters,
than what he ought to have expected; they never profe&s;t Sub|mi&s;&s;ion
beyond the Bounds of the Law; never told the King he might
do what he pleas'd with them, and that their Wives, Lives, Children
and E&s;tates were his Cattle, and his Goods to di&s;po&s;e at his Plea&s;ure;
they never told him that his Authority, was equal with that of God
him&s;elf; and to re&s;i&s;t him, tho' he &s;hould turn Tyrant, was a Damning
Sin.</P>
<P>They alway knew a Legal Obedience, and no other; they under&s;tood
them&s;elves bound to re&s;i&s;t Violence of all &s;orts, and to be at Liberty to
oppo&s;e all that &s;hould attempt the Life of the Con&s;titution, as the uni|ver&s;al
Enemies of their Country; this they had pract&s;ed in all Ages, and
&s;o had other Nations likewi&s;e, and King <HI>James</HI> could expect no other
from them.</P>
<P>The Sum of all is this; all Nations determine, That Kings who invade
their Peoples Liberties, break in upon Con&s;titutions, and the Sacred <HI>Po|&s;tulata</HI>
of Government; that oppre&s;s their Subjects, and impo&s;e unju&s;t
and intolerable things upon them, MAY BE RESISTED; be it by cal|ling
in and joyning with Foreign Aid, or be it by taking Arms in the
Defence of the Law and Common Liberty; this is what is declar'd in
the Revolution, and this is the Foundation upon which the Parliament
took Arms in the Time of King <HI>Charles</HI> I.</P>
<P>And upon this very &s;core, tho' in the Common Stile they were call'd
Rebels, yet at the Treaty of <HI>&V;xbridge,</HI> his Maje&s;ty conde&s;cended to treat
with them as an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament, and &s;uch they certainly then were,
however afterward di&s;po&s;e&s;s'd and cru&s;h'd by the Soldiery: And in the
Matter of War, the King even from the fir&s;t, voluntarily declin'd treat|ing
them as Rebells, but gave Quarter of War to their Men, Exchang'd
and Ran&s;om'd their Pri&s;oners, and in all things us'd them as fair Ene|mies;
and the like without doubt would have been done, had King <HI>James</HI>
the Second &s;tood out with his Subjects, and it had gone on to a War.</P>
<P>From all the&s;e things it appears, that it has never been the Opini|on
of the People of <HI>England,</HI> that the Sacred Right of their Princes ex|tended
to protect them again&s;t the Laws; or that if they acted contrary
to their Duty and Contract, they were forbid even to Di&s;place and De|throne
them.</P>
<P>From whence then, and for what ends the Modern Politicks of the&s;e
Ages have u&s;her'd this Mon&s;ter into the World, would merit &s;ome Hi|&s;tory,
were it not directly to be an&s;wer'd in a very few words.</P>
<P>The Ri&s;e, Birth and Introduction of this Piece of Incon&s;i&s;tence in Rea|&s;oning,
I take to be properly accounted for, thus: A meer Device, and po|litick
Invention, furni&s;h'd from the Fountain of Mi&s;chief, <HI>viz.</HI> Man's cor|rupt
yet fruitful Imagination, prompted by the Author of all Mi&s;chief,
<PB N="xv" REF="19">
the Devil; calculated for the erecting, and found out by &s;uch as purpo&s;ed
to introduce Tyranny, and ab&s;olute Government in the World.</P>
<P>In the&s;e, and in their Plots again&s;t human Liberty, and Civil Society,
this Creature had its Birth; &s;ince 'tis evident nothing can &s;erve &s;o natural|ly
to the Helli&s;h Purpo&s;e of &s;ubduing the Civil Rights of a Nation,
as fir&s;t to captivate their Minds, and infu&s;e Notions of &s;omething Sa|cred,
either in the Per&s;on or Authority of the Wretch they were to be
oppre&s;s'd by: Thus the way is made &s;mooth for all the horrid Excur&s;i|ons
of the mo&s;t vicious and encroaching Tyrants in the World; for who
in his Sen&s;es would re&s;i&s;t the Voice of the King, if once he were bigotted
into an Opinion that it was in a perfect Conjuncton with, had a re&s;em|blance
of, and was back'd with Sacred Authority, from the Commands
of God.</P>
<P>And this doubtle&s;s was the Occa&s;ion of the Profane Attempts in the
Ca&s;e of &s;everal of the <HI>Roman</HI> and <HI>Grecian</HI> Tyrants, of cau&s;ing Divine Ho|nours
to be paid them; by this they obtain'd &s;o much upon the &s;ubject|ed
Minds of the Poor-<HI>impo&s;ed-upon</HI>- Multitude, that the&s;e entirely gave
up their Liberties to the Ab&s;olute Tyranny of every barbarous Inhuman
Wretch: and who could que&s;tion but it would be &s;o, when once the
Folly of Men was prevail'd upon to believe the Divinity of the Tyrant,
<Q>Who would not, <HI>if the Gods &s;hould rule,</HI> Obey.</Q></P>
<P>Thus this Delu&s;ion gain'd upon the World, as a &s;tudyed Introduction to
Univer&s;al Bondage&mdash;And nothing el&s;e could have made us &s;toop in the&s;e
wi&s;er Ages, <HI>as we &s;ay they are, of the World;</HI> Nothing could &s;o well have
reconcil'd us to the Ab&s;urdities of Arbitrary Power, as to back the Pre|po&s;terous
Notion with &s;trange Suppo&s;itions of a Sacred Stamp upon the
<HI>Royal Thing</HI> impo&s;ing, as a proper handle to prepare our Subjection to what
on no other Terms, or by no other Method we could be brought to.</P>
<P>And yet as all evil De&s;igns generally ruin them&s;elves, by pu&s;hing too
far a certain Token of the Wrong Foundation they &s;tand on, &s;o it was
here; for had they been content to have fix'd the Sacred upon the Office,
and not altogether upon the Per&s;on of the Monarch, they might by
their u&s;ual Artifice have run us a great way blindfold; but as they
fore&s;aw that would not &s;o entirely vindicate the con&s;tant Enormities
committed by &s;uch Flagrant Wretches as God for the Execution of his
Judgments &s;ometimes thinks fit to &s;uffer on the Thrones of Power; &s;o,
like Men re&s;olv'd to an&s;wer every End, and, if po&s;&s;ible to bring deluded
Nations into an ab&s;olute Subjection to the Devil, under the Notion of a
God, they in&s;i&s;t upon the Divinity of the Per&s;on of a King, inherent in
him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Whether this inherent Divinity, is convey'd to him by his Office, or
his Line, they have not yet thought fit to determine, but have left it as
one of the un&s;urmountable Difficulties of the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of Tyranny
by Divine Right, which future Ages may Solve if they can; or rather,
which will ri&s;e up again&s;t the Forgery, with &s;uch una&s;werable Violence, as
mu&s;t &s;ome time or other effectually undeceive the World, and re&s;tore
Men to their Sen&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="xvi" REF="20">
For if Kings have their Divinity by Line, then none can have it but
the Line; 'tis an Inheritance of the Royal Blood, form the fir&s;t Great
Prince that Heaven deputed it to, and every Branch of that Line mu&s;t
enjoy it; who that Prince was, when the Sanction was impre&s;s'd upon
him, and entail'd on his Po&s;terity, is a My&s;tery yet unfolded; but where
he found how the mo&s;t antient Family now reigning will do to <HI>Cap Pede|grees,</HI>
and derive from that &s;anctified Blood, is a new Difficulty pa&s;t any
mortal Reach, and the ready way to bring &s;ome Scandal upon all the
Families of Royal Blood in the World, as Up&s;tarts and U&s;urper.</P>
<P>If puzzled with this Wilderne&s;s-Inquiry, they would on the other
hand remove the Sacred from the Line to the Office, that is, the Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion;
they open the Door to all manner of Violence and U&s;urpation,
&s;ince then he that has the Crown, becomes equally Divine with him that
ought to have it, and the U&s;urper is as Sacred as the mo&s;t righful Mo|narch
in the World.</P>
<P>Other Ab&s;urdities al&s;o would follow here, <HI>viz.</HI> a Per&s;on might be Sa|cred
to day, and not to morrow; if Sacred at all, it could not be lawful
to Dethrone him; and yet if Dethron'd, the Per&s;on who did it, by
what&s;oever Violence, Inju&s;tice, Cruelty or Blood, by his &s;tepping into
the Seat, became <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> as Divine, as Sacred, and as much to be obey'd
upon pain of Damnation, as he; and &s;o <HI>vice ver&s;a</HI> from Tyrant to Tyrant,
as often as Providence thought fit to let Power overcome Right in the
World.</P>
<P>I &s;hall no more Trouble my Reader with &s;earching this Maze of Folly,
its ridiculous and incon&s;i&s;tent Nature merits rather to be expos'd than De|bated;
and therefore was this <HI>Satyr</HI> wrote; in which, if this Football of
<HI>Jure Divino</HI> is not &s;ufficiently kick'd about, you mu&s;t blame the Ability,
not the Good Will of the Author.</P>
<P>I know it has been expected I &s;hould in this Book have examin'd into
all the Parts of Tyranny, as well Eccle&s;ia&s;tical as Civil, and perhaps
there had been room enough for <HI>Satyr</HI> upon our Church-Tyranny; e&s;pe|as
it has been lately practis'd, and &s;ince endeavour'd to be Re-e&s;tabli&s;h'd
in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But I have wav'd this unplea&s;ant task for many Rea&s;ons, and &s;ome
of them are as follow.</P>
<P>1. Becau&s;e it &s;eems to be at and in <HI>England,</HI> I look on it as a Lyon
&s;lain, buried in the Grave of the Popi&s;h Inva&s;ions, and Arbitrary En|croachments
of the Late Reigns of King <HI>C&mdash;s</HI> and King <HI>J</HI>&mdash;<HI>s</HI> II. a
Criminal convicted by the Revolution, and executed by the Legal To|leration,
which is part of the E&s;tabli&s;hment of the&s;e Nations; and a thing
on which too much now depends, to give us any ju&s;t Concern for its
Danger: Per&s;ecution, and Prie&s;tly Tyranny, has receiv'd its Mortal
Wound; in vain have been all the Attempts to revive it&mdash;And
I doubt not &s;o they will continue.</P>
<P>2. As the Sovereignty of Con&s;cience has gain'd the Victory over Par|ty
Inva&s;ion, and the Church her &s;elf has di&s;own'd the Doctrine of Per&s;e|cution,
as <HI>a thing contrary to her Doctrine,</HI> and contrary to <HI>the Principles
of the Chri&s;tian Religion,</HI> it cannot be that a Re&s;urrection of that Spirit
can happen in this Nation, till <HI>England</HI> &s;hall &s;o far forget her &s;elf, as to
<PB N="xvii" REF="21">
contradict <HI>her own Doctrine,</HI> and act <HI>contrary to the Principles</HI> of the
Chri&s;tian Religion.</P>
<P>And &s;hould that unhappy time ever come to pa&s;s in <HI>England,</HI> when
the Church, by the Errors and Impo&s;itions of any Party, &s;hall be brought
to &s;uch Excentrick Mea&s;ures, they may depend upon it, that when &s;he
comes to her &s;elf again, &s;he will return to the &s;ame Moderation, which
&s;he owns by her Principle to be ju&s;t.</P>
<P>Per&s;ecution therefore which is a meer Church-Tyranny, is an Enemy
Conquer'd, ab&s;olutely &s;ubdued, and I think Probabilities ju&s;tify me &s;peak|ing
with A&s;&s;urance, will never have a Re&s;urrection again in this Na|tion.</P>
<P>There can but one thing re&s;tore the Dominion of this evil Spirit in
this Nation, and that mu&s;t be the Return of Popery upon us; and if this
&s;ort of Per&s;ecution comes among us, it will make no difference between
Church of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Di&s;&s;enter,</HI> but Per&s;ecution re&s;pecting Prote&s;tan|ti&s;m
in General will be our Fate; and how odious will Prote&s;tant-Per|&s;ecution
look then! All equally differ and di&s;&s;ent from Popery; I hope
they will not pu&s;h me upon entring on the ungrateful Compari&s;on of who
differs mo&s;t, or who&s;e Principle is remote&s;t from the Chruch of <HI>Rome;</HI>
if Popery prevails, the whole Prote&s;tant Church will be one Body of
<HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> under the Burthen of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Per&s;ecution, and under a
Church-Tyranny, which the Chri&s;tian Religion abhors; and &s;ome that
are very forward to per&s;ecute for the private Opinions of Men, would
do well to con&s;ider.</P>
<P>1. How naturally their tearing one another to Pieces by unrea&s;onable
and unchri&s;tian Feuds, tends to pulling down the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t in
General in the&s;e Nations; laying open the Fences and Fortifications
of the Church, which &s;o much con&s;i&s;t in a General Unity, and expo&s;e|ing
her to be devour'd by Popery and Super&s;tition.</P>
<P>2. How readily it fills the Mouths of the Enemies of the Church,
who wait for her halting with, Arguments again&s;t the very Foundation of
her Principles, that while &s;he blames the <HI>Roman</HI> Church for Coercives,
and the Fury of Church Tyranny, &s;he at the &s;ame time falls upon her
weak Brethren that offer to &s;eparate from her Communion, and to tear
them to pieces by like unju&s;tifiable Tyranny.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Application I can make from hence, is, That Per|&s;ecution
is <HI>a Seed of the Devil,</HI> born of <HI>Civil Tyranny,</HI> and degenerated
into a meaner Species of Kind than its Orignal; for I readily confirm this
Maxim,
<Q><L>That of all Plagues with which Mankind is Cur&s;t,</L>
<L>Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Tyranny's the wor&s;t.</L></Q></P>
<P>'Tis plain, <HI>Per&s;ecution</HI> is a thing really odious and hateful to all Na|tions,
and therefore mo&s;t Religions in the World mo&s;t indu&s;triou&s;ly
avoid the Challenge, and either &s;trive to throw it off from one another,
or excu&s;e them&s;elves by Charging it upon their Neighbours; al&s;o think|ing
to extenuate the Crime, by having it allow'd to be univer&s;al.</P>
<P>The Church of <HI>Rome</HI> began with this, and <HI>Saunders</HI> the Je&s;uit re|proaches
the Church of <HI>England</HI> with per&s;ecuting their Fellow-Hereticks,
<PB N="xviii" REF="22">
even as &s;oon as they were but ju&s;t got out of the Reach of Fire and Fag|got
them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The Church of <HI>England</HI> on the other hand, reproaches the Di&s;&s;enters
with the &s;ame Spirit, boa&s;ting the Pretences to the <HI>Jure Divino</HI> of <HI>Pre&s;|bytery,</HI>
in&s;tancing farther in the late Proclamation for bani&s;hing Prelatick
Mini&s;ters in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Per&s;ecution of the <HI>Quakers</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI>
and the like.</P>
<P>The Truth is, no Church, <HI>but that of Rome,</HI> profe&s;&s;es Per&s;ecution; and
that I may not charge the <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> with the Article of Per&s;e|cution
without Ground, I refer the Reader to the Oath of a Bi&s;hop to
the Pope, &s;et down at large in my Lord Bi&s;hop of <HI>Salisbury</HI>'s Hi&s;tory of
the Reformation; &startq;Hereticks, Schi&s;maticks, and Rebells, to our Holy

were bound by Oath to per&s;ecute tho&s;e that were deem'd Sci&s;maticks
and Hereticks.</P>
<P>But in the Church of <HI>England</HI> its quite differnt, and as the Nature
of her Con&s;titution is incon&s;i&s;tent with the per&s;ecuting Principle, the Re|formation
having begun in an Abhorrence of Per&s;ecution; &s;o to me it is
a Declaration never to be forgotten, which we found in the Preamble
to the fir&s;t Occa&s;ional Bill and tho' &s;ome have taken Care to obli|terate
it, by leaving it out in the &s;econd Bill, I cannot but on all Occa&s;i|ons
repeat it, in order to perpetuate it to Po&s;terity, as a thing which de|&s;erves
to be recorded to the Honour of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> viz.
<HI>Whereas Per&s;ecution for Con&s;cience Sake is contrary to the Principles of the
Chri&s;tian Religion, and to the Doctrine of the Church of</HI> England, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Be
it Enacted&mdash;</P>
<P>Under all the&s;e Circum&s;tances I cannot but take the Freedom to &s;ay, the
Prote&s;tant Religion in <HI>England</HI> &s;eems to Triumph over Per&s;ecution, with|out
any Fear or Danger of its recovering its &s;elf in time to come; To|leration
is now a Publick Right by Law, as it was before a Right of Con|&s;cience;
and would the Patrons of Tyranny &s;uffer them&s;elves to judge im|partially,
and put the Civil Peace of the Nation in the Balance with their
private Sen&s;e of things, they cannot but judge that Toleration of Reli|gious
Di&s;&s;enters is mo&s;t &s;uited to the General Good both of Religion,
Civil Government, and the Common Intere&s;ts of Nations.</P>
<P>I would not here enter the Di&s;&s;enter's Claim of Right to the Tole|ration
they now enjoy, were it not that we are &s;o often told that To|leration
to Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England</HI> is the meer Grace and Bounty of the Church.</P>
<P>That if it were &s;o, we had a great deal to thank them for, I readily
own, and no Man &s;hould be more forward to own, and upon all Occa|&s;ions
acknowledge the Debt&mdash;But however I would not le&s;&s;en the Cha|rity
and Tenderne&s;s of the Church, ab&s;tracted from the Impo&s;itions of

but by &s;omething that mu&s;t overturn Nation, Con&s;titution, and Pro|te&s;tant

<P>I forbear to enlarge upon this Head, becau&s;e I have at large in&s;i&s;ted
upon it; and I think effectually clear'd it up in another place; and I ne|ver
yet met with any Per&s;on that thought fit to debate the Particulars.</P>
<P>But when I am &s;peaking of this Article of Toleration of Religion,
Liberty of Con&s;cience, and the like, it naturally occurs to examine the
Pretences of tho&s;e Gentlemen who pre&s;s the Di&s;&s;enters, and I mu&s;t &s;ay
very imprudently as to the Matter of Univer&s;al Toleration; and that I
may not be charg'd with taking them at an Advantage, I &s;hall not tye
them up to the literal Sen&s;e of their words; but take them in their own
declar'd Meaning.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Stephens</HI> in a certain, <HI>to him unhappy, Libel</HI> upon the Government,
entitled, <HI>A Letter to the Author of the Memorial of the State of</HI> England,
has an Expre&s;&s;ion to this Purpo&s;e; <HI>Whether it might not be for the Intere&s;t
of the Di&s;&s;enters to declare them&s;elves for an &V;niver&s;al Toleration of all Opi|nions
meerly Religious?</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Toland</HI> &s;ince that de&s;igning &s;omething for the Pre&s;s upon this Head,
&s;ends three Letters, one to the <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> one to the <HI>Independents,</HI> and
one to the <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI> Congregations, to move them to declare them&s;elves on
this Article of Univer&s;al Toleration, and de&s;ires them to give him their
An&s;wer in Writing, which I have been told he de&s;ign'd to Publi&s;h.</P>
<P>I will not determine here for any Body but my &s;elf, and therefore the&s;e
Gentlemen mu&s;t not pretend to take my An&s;wer here for the General
Opinion of the Di&s;&s;enters; but as I venture my private Opinion in this
Ca&s;e, all Men are at Liberty to pa&s;s their Judgments upon it as they &s;ee
convenient.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Stephens</HI> propo&s;es this to the Di&s;&s;enters as a thing which he thinks
a Debt from them with re&s;pect to the Papi&s;ts, who Charge the Prote|&s;tants
in General with Per&s;ecuting Princples, and as he &s;eems al&s;o to
in&s;inuate, that nothing but this can entitle them to a right of Toleration
them&s;elves; and this is plain from his own Words.</P>
<P>All Men have a Right to the Liberty of their Con&s;ciences, exept tho&s;e who
have denied that Liberty to others.</P>
<P>What he afterwards De&s;igns, by proving the Church of <HI>England</HI> has
denied Liberty, and has per&s;ecuted others for Con&s;cience, I know not,
nor can I infer any thing from it; but that therefore he thinks the Church
of <HI>England</HI> merits not the Toleration &s;he did refu&s;e to give; if this be
the meaning, the Papi&s;ts are more beholden to that Gentlemen than the
Church of <HI>England,</HI> who&s;e Cloth he wears.</P>
<P>But why mu&s;t the Di&s;&s;enters declare them&s;elves <HI>for</HI> univer&s;al Tolera|tion?
or why <HI>for</HI> or <HI>again&s;t?</HI> Why declare them&s;elves at all?</P>
<P><PB N="xx" REF="24">
Mr. <HI>Toland</HI> in his Letter urges a kind of Nece&s;&s;ity of it, to remove the
Scandals endeavour'd to be thrown upon the Di&s;&s;enters, as a People of a
per&s;ecuting Temper; and that while they make loud Complaints again&s;t
Per&s;ecution, talk much of the Sovereignty of Con&s;cience, and the Right
of Mankind to a Liberty of wor&s;hipping God thier own way, they them|&s;elves,
were the Power put in thier hands, would pu&s;h upon Coercives,
a&s;&s;ert the Divine Right of their own Con&s;titution, and make equal Re|&s;traints
upon their Fellow Chri&s;tians that differ'd from them in Opinion;
and to clear them of this Scandal, that Gentleman thinks it &s;tands them
in &s;tead to undeceive the World in the point of their Charity, and the
Widene&s;s of their Principles, and to ju&s;tify them&s;elves to the World.</P>
<P>I will not &s;u&s;pect, much le&s;s di&s;pute the Expre&s;&s;ions of Tenderne&s;s
and &s;incere Regard to the Intere&s;t and Reputation of Religion in Gene|ral,
and of the Di&s;&s;enters in particular, which Mr. <HI>Toland</HI> profe&s;&s;es to
be the true Motives of his de&s;iring them to make &s;uch a publick Decla|ration,
but leave it here till I &s;peak to it in General.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Stephens</HI>'s De&s;ire to have the Di&s;&s;enters declare them&s;elves for this
Univer&s;al Toleration, &s;eems to be a Challenge to them, to make out
their Title to Toleration them&s;elves, &s;ince by his Rule no Men have any
Claim to Toleration for their own Opinion that would not grant Tolera|tion
to others.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing, <HI>tho' I do not grant it,</HI> that the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England</HI>
are not for Tolerating all Opinions; I would ask, Does it follow from
thence, that they mu&s;t not be Tolerated?</P>
<P>All Opinions that are meerly Religious, are not equally Orthodox&punc;
Now if my Opinion be really in it &s;elf, Doctrinally &s;ound, tho' not in all
things relating to Circum&s;tances, conforming to the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Mode, will
nothing entitle me to a Toleration of my &s;ound and orthodox Opinion,
but being willing to Tolerate another Opinion that is Hetrodox, Bla&s;|phemous
or Heretical?</P>
<P>If we mu&s;t not di&s;tingui&s;h of Opinions, which are, or are not con&s;i|&s;tent
with the Chri&s;tian Religion, then we mu&s;t not di&s;tingui&s;h of
tho&s;e things which the Scripture has plainly di&s;tingui&s;h'd; as in the Ca&s;e
of the Church of <HI>Pergamos,</HI> where &s;he is blamed for having THERE,
that is, <HI>Tolerated</HI> in her, or with her, tho&s;e who hold&mdash;The Doctrine
of <HI>Balaam,</HI> who tought <HI>Balak</HI> to ca&s;t a Stumbling-block before the Chil|dren
of <HI>I&s;rael, Rev.</HI> 12. 14. and again, <HI>v.</HI> 16. SO HAST THOU ALSO;
them that hold the Doctrine of the <HI>Nicolaitans;</HI> which thing I hate&mdash;
<HI>Repent therefore,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Again, the Church of <HI>Thyatira</HI> is blam'd for Toleration, <HI>v.</HI> 20. <HI>Becau&s;e
thou &s;uffere&s;t that Woman</HI> Jezabel, <HI>who calleth her &s;elf a Prophete&s;s, to teach
and &s;educe my Servants,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I will not undertake a Comment upon this Text, or enter into the
Debate, what Errors are meant by the Doctrines the&s;e taught, but to me
it &s;eems plain that the Spirit of God does direct us not to Tolerate &s;uch
in his Church as Teach the Doctrines which his Soul hates, which are
de&s;tructive of his Honour, and of the Nature of Religion, Heretical
and Abominable.</P>
<P><PB N="xxi" REF="25">
The Churches are here blam'd for having &s;uch among them; and in
another place for &s;uffering them&mdash;What &s;hould prevent my conclu|ding
that &s;uch are not to be Tolerated in the Church, I confe&s;s I cannot
fore&s;ee, and therefore I leave it to be cen&s;ur'd as the Reader plea&s;es.</P>
<P>But when we come to Toleration of Orthodox Churches, let us ex|amine
the &s;ame Text, and there we find &s;ome of the Churches left their
fir&s;t Love, as that at <HI>Ephe&s;us;</HI> others had a Name of Living, but were Dead,
as the Church of <HI>Sardis;</HI> others neither <HI>cold nor hot</HI> in Religion, as the
Church of <HI>Laodicea,</HI> and the like, and yet all are own'd by the Scripture,
as Churches, and being Sound in Doctrine, are only admoni&s;hed to repent,
but no where denied a Name among the Churches.</P>
<P>From this I pretend to offer this Po&s;itive A&s;&s;ertion, That Chri&s;tans
of what Denomination &s;oever, being Orthodox in Principle, and Sound
in Doctrine, have a Native Right to Liberty of &s;erving God, ac|cording
to the Dictates of their own Con&s;ciences, and ought to be To|lerated,
provided they behave them&s;elves peaceably under the Govern|ment,
and obedient in all other things to the Civil Magi&s;tracy of the
Country in which they live.</P>
<P>That I &s;hould &s;ay the &s;ame of Opinions that are Bla&s;phemous and He|retical,
that deny the Fundamentals of the Chri&s;tian Religion, derogate
from the Nature or Attributes of God, or the Honour and Divinity of
our Redeemer, or any the like de&s;perate Errors, I &s;ee no Foundation for
it in the Scripture, or in the Nature of the thing.</P>
<P>If it &s;hall be enquir'd here, who &s;hall determine what is or is not Or|thodox,
and alledged every Man being po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with the Soundne&s;s of
his own Opinion, this will &s;end us all to <HI>Rome</HI> for an infallible Judge in
every Di&s;pute.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t an&s;wer there is no occa&s;ion for any &s;uch Difficulties, the few
things which &s;erve to declare the difference between an Orthodox Chri&s;tain
and a Heretick, are &s;o plain, &s;o vi&s;ible in Scripture, &s;o explicit in our Creeds
and Con&s;e&s;&s;ions of Faith, in which all Orthodox Chri&s;tians agree; that
we need go no farther; the Scripture is allow'd by all Chri&s;tians to be
the Rule of Faith, &s;ufficient to In&s;truction; the Chri&s;tian Confe&s;&s;ions of
Faith are a Collection of the fundamental Heads of our Religion, de|duc'd
from the &s;aid Scriptures, compo&s;ed of plain, indi&s;putable Truths,
unto which whoever agrees, tho' in the <HI>Addenda</HI> and Circum&s;tances of
Order, Di&s;cipline and Manner, he may differ, he is in the Sen&s;e of all
Chri&s;tians, an Orthodox Believer.</P>
<P>But if a Man denies the Nature, Being, or Attributes of God, the
Re&s;urrect on of the Body, Futurity of Rewards and Puni&s;hments;
the Divinity, Conception, Birth, Death, Re&s;urrection, A&s;cen&s;ion and
Interce&s;&s;ion of our Redeemer; his delegated Power of Judgment and
Retribution: the Power, Operation and Efficacy of the Holy Spirit, and
the My&s;tical Union of the Trinity; if any Man denies the Nece&s;&s;ity of
Faith and Repentance, and the Salvation of a Soul, only by the Pur|cha&s;e
and Merits of a Redeemer, and the like e&s;&s;ential Points of the
Chri&s;tian Religion; &s;uch a Man is a Di&s;ciple of that <HI>Jezabel,</HI> who call,
her &s;elf a Prophete&s;s, and who ought not to be &s;uffered, that is, Tolera|ted,
in the Church of Chri&s;t to teach and &s;educe his People to commit
Fornication, <HI>&amp;c. Rev.</HI> 2. 20.</P>
<P><PB N="xxii" REF="26">
I think we have no need of a Pope here, the infallible Judge is before
you, <HI>to the Word and to the Te&s;timony;</HI> the Proof is plain, and the di|&s;tinction
I hope is according to Charity.</P>
<P>To Per&s;ecute any Man or Body of Men, that own and profe&s;s &s;uch Fun|damental
Doctrines as the&s;e, is an evident Inva&s;ion of the Native Rights
of Con&s;cience, which in &s;uch Matters can be &s;ubject to no temporal Ju|ri&s;diction,
no nor any human Power, Eccle&s;ia&s;tical or Civil; and there|fore
is meer Church-Tyranny, exploded and abhor'd by all Nations of
Chri&s;tians, and of which I have already noted, that it has been declar'd
by the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> to be contrary to the Principles of the Chri|&s;tian
Religion, and the Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But yet to &s;ay, that therefore all manner of Excur&s;ions, Bla&s;phemous
Opinions, and Heretical Doctrines, mu&s;t be allow'd as a General Homage
paid to the Claim of Con&s;cience; I &s;ee no Connection in the thing, nor
any thing on either hand that makes &s;uch a Toleration a Con&s;equence
of the other.</P>
<P>But come we now to the Enquiry, What have the Di&s;&s;enters to do
in this Ca&s;e? and why &s;hould they be call'd upon to make any Declara|tion
on this Head?</P>
<P>If any Man means by this to make an invidious Enquiry, which of
the &s;everal &s;orts of Di&s;&s;enters are wide&s;t in their Toleration-Charity, who
would or would not per&s;ecute if it was in their Power, and look back
upon former Days to fetch their Proofs of what may be, from what has
been.</P>
<P>At lea&s;t let &s;uch People pretend no more that this Inquiry is made to
unite, fortify, defend, and clear the Scandals rais'd again&s;t the Di&s;&s;en|ters,
&s;ince &s;uch Enquiries tend to divide, make Reflections and Compa|ri&s;ons,
the Practice of which is equally odious with the Con&s;equences.</P>
<P>And farther, let them ob&s;erve, that they will find nothing from &s;uch an
Enquiry or Retro&s;pect, but what may be joyn'd to like or wor&s;e Actions
of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and buried among tho&s;e things which they
are equally willing &s;hould be forgotten.</P>
<P>The influences of the &s;everal Courts, the Effects of the Di&s;putes about
the <HI>Jus Divinum,</HI> of &s;everal &s;orts of Power, whether Regal, Epi&s;copal,
or Presbyterial, have had fatal Effects in their &s;everal Turns&mdash;But all
may have a good I&s;&s;ue, in making every Age amend the Errors of their
Fathers; and I cannot think it is to be argued, That if the Presbyterian
Power were re&s;tored to its full Exerci&s;e, it would proceed to Per&s;ecuti|on
of other Orthodox Opinions, becau&s;e, <HI>as they &s;ay,</HI> it was once &s;o, any
more than it is to be argued, That the Church of <HI>England,</HI> if the Tolera|tion-Act
were repeal'd, and the Law <HI>de Haeretico Comburendo</HI> re&s;tor'd, would
condemn the <HI>Quakers</HI> and <HI>Bapti&s;ts</HI> to Fire and Faggot, becau&s;e they for|merly
did &s;o.</P>
<P>The&s;e Sugge&s;tions therefore as contentious and malicious, I mu&s;t ex|plode;
and being equally bury'd in an E&s;tabli&s;h'd Toleration, the Re|tro&s;pect
is needle&s;s and impertinent.</P>
<P>But to come nearer to Mr. <HI>Toland,</HI> Why &s;hould the Di&s;&s;enters take
upon them to declare their Opinion of who has or has not a Religious
Right to Toleration? 'Tis plain they have a Civil Right to it; 'tis the Pur|chace
of their Blood and Trea&s;ure; 'tis one of the Articles of their Confede|racy
<PB N="xxiii" REF="27">
with the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and &s;tipulated at a Time when it was
in their Power to have been a &s;ore Ob&s;truction to the pre&s;ent Safety and
flouri&s;hing Condition of the Church, if not to have pull'd her quite
down; from whence I cannot but note, That to talk now of Gifts, Cha|rity,
and meer Conce&s;&s;ion of Grace, is a little ungrateful, and looks as if
&s;ome Gentlemen had forgot what Condition their Affairs were in, when
the Di&s;&s;enters left all the ea&s;e and promi&s;ed Liberty of the inviting Court,
and embark'd in the &s;ame Hazards with the Church, meerly for the &s;up|porting
that Church, which &s;ome are &s;o unkind to &s;ay they would de&s;troy.</P>
<P>Here's the Foundation of the pre&s;ent Liberty; and therefore $he Di&s;|&s;enters
are unconcern'd with the Di&s;pute about the Religious Right to a
Liberty of Opinion in matters of Con&s;cience.</P>
<P>Not that the Di&s;&s;enters have le&s;s Right by the Nature of the thing to
a Toleration of Religion, but their Native Liberty is fortified by the ad|dition
of this Civil Right; they claim it by both, and in both their Te|nure
is Good; 'tis a free Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion without Homage or Acknowledgment.</P>
<P>What is it to them, who ought to be Toletated, <HI>or who not;</HI> 'tis plain
that both ways THEY OUGHT to be Tolerated, &s;ince not their Enemies
them&s;elves can charge them with any Opinions that are not Orthodox,
that are Heretical, Bla&s;phemous, or incon&s;i&s;tent with the Chri&s;tian Re|ligion,
and that confirms their Religious Right; and 'tis a Claim by
Treaty, and &s;tipulated on conditions compleatly perform'd on <HI>their Side,</HI>
and hone&s;tly executed by the lawful Authority and Government of the
Nation <HI>on the other Side;</HI> and that confirms their Civil Right.</P>
<P>As to the Di&s;&s;enters declaring what they would do if they were ve&s;ted
with the Power in Government, and how far they would go in Tolerat|ing
all Opinions meerly Religious&mdash;I cannot conceive the be&s;t An&s;wer
in the World can be &s;o effectual, inoffen&s;ive and &s;ignificant, as no An&s;wer
at all, to &s;uch a many-fac'd Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>And tho' I will noway Attempt here to determine the De&s;ign of the
Que&s;tion, which I rather cho&s;e to &s;uppo&s;e as &s;incere and as free from
De&s;ign, as the Enquirer &s;ays it is; yet the apparent ill Con&s;truction
which both the Que&s;tion, and the be&s;t An&s;wer that could be given might
be liable to, makes the giving no An&s;wer to it very proper, I need take
little pains to explain.</P>
<P>Should the Di&s;&s;enters declare for Univer&s;al Toleration of all Opinions
meerly Religious, To what manife&s;t Objections &s;uch a Declaration would
be liable, in re&s;pect to the e&s;&s;ential Parts of &s;ome Peoples Profe&s;&s;ion, and
how many Inconveniences the Di&s;putes of that &s;ort might lead them to,
I will not here examine.</P>
<P>But what Sport would &s;ome People be glad of the Opportunity of
making; &s;hould any Man have been &s;o weak to an&s;wer for what any
Party would do if the Power were in their hands! and how would &s;ome
People, <HI>who are fond of pretending from every Trifle that the Di&s;&s;enters dream
of Power and Government,</HI> pre&s;ently flye upon them, and &s;ay they were
determining their Conduct again&s;t they met with the Opportunity!</P>
<P>Should they declare for a General Anarchy of Opinions, what Confu|&s;ions
would the&s;e People argue upon, as the Con&s;equence of their Latitu|dinarian
Power?</P>
<P><PB N="xxiv" REF="28">
Should they declare again&s;t it, how would they ruffle the Di&s;&s;enters
upon the Article of a Per&s;ecuting Spirit? and who can pretend a real Zeal
for the Intere&s;t of the Di&s;&s;enters, and attempt to draw them into any
thing from which &s;o much injurious Advantage again&s;t them might be
taken?</P>
<P>On the other hand what benefit can there be to any Per&s;on from this
Declaration, what can any Man propo&s;e to them to move it?</P>
<P>To &s;ay &s;uch a Declaration entitles them to the Toleration they enjoy,
as Mr. <HI>Stephens,</HI> is to &s;ay nothing, becau&s;e they have a better Title to it
already, and this will not &s;o much as add the lea&s;t Strength to it.</P>
<P>To &s;ay it is to clear them from Scandal, is to &s;ay nothing, &s;ince they really
lie under no Scandal already upon that Account; and if the Church
&s;hould throw any Dirt of that Sort from Days of Infirmity on both &s;ides,
&s;o much of it would fly back in her own Face, as would drown the
Memory of tho&s;e Pretences.</P>
<P>Both the Church of <HI>England</HI> and the Di&s;&s;enters have gone &s;uch a length
in the Article of Toleration and Chri&s;tian Liberty, as I am free to &s;ay
has buryed all the Fears of Per&s;ecution here, let what Government will,
Popery excepted, get uppermo&s;t&mdash;And in this Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Liberty
lies buryed all Church-Tyranny; <HI>and there let it lye</HI> FOR EVER AND
FOR AY.</P>
<P>To have the Di&s;&s;enters &s;ay what they will, or will not do, when that
&s;hall happen, which they them&s;elves do not de&s;ire &s;hould come to pa&s;s,
&s;eems to have &s;omething in it too weak for the Propo&s;er, methinks he could
not be capable, his Learning and Judgment con&s;ider'd, of imagining
the Gentlemen he wrote to could be &s;o weak, as to make any Publick
Conclu&s;ion or Determination on that Head, which to me would have
been the fir&s;t Action they had ever done, to make the World think them
unworthy of that Liberty they enjoy'd.</P>
<P>I had not &s;poke to this here, but as I thought it very proper as well
to lay down the true Foundation upon which the Di&s;&s;enters enjoy their
Liberty, as to clear up that &s;uppo&s;ed Obligation which they are fancied
to lie under, That becau&s;e <HI>they who ought to have Liberty</HI> enjoy it, there|fore,
they &s;hould be oblig'd to e&s;pou&s;e a general Liberty to others, whe|ther
they have an equal Claim, or indeed any Claim to it or no.</P>
<P>I conclude this Head with only one Ob&s;ervation more; Suppo&s;e the
Enquirer here &s;hould not Grant the Claim of Civil Right to Liberty and
Toleration which I &s;ay the Di&s;&s;enters have, but that they enjoy it as the
meer Gift and Bounty o$ the Church. This mo&s;t certainly makes it yet
more unrea&s;onable for them to declare them&s;elves as to the Tolerating
others; for if what they enjoy be a Gift, then it is ab&s;olutely in the Church
or in the Government, <HI>take it where you will,</HI> to be&s;tow it, or not to
be&s;tow it; and who to be&s;tow it upon, or who to withhold it from;
otherwi&s;e the Gift is re&s;train'd, and is no more a Gift, but an Act of
Debt or Nece&s;&s;ity</P>
<P>It would be then very ungrateful and di&s;re&s;pectful to the&s;e Benefactors,
for the Di&s;&s;enters, as &s;oon as they receiv'd this meer Grace and Bounty
of the Chorch, to pretend to pre&s;cribe to the Denors, who ought or ought
not to partake of the Gift as well as they. When you have given an Alms to
<PB N="xxv" REF="29">
a Beggar, you would take it for a piece of uncommon In&s;olence, that
he &s;hould come and bring another Beggar to you, pretending you ought
to relieve him too.</P>
<P>If this be a Grace, the Di&s;&s;enters Bu&s;ine&s;s is to go away and be thank|ful,
and not concern them&s;elves with who is or is not intitled to the
Bounty.</P>
<P>So that take it which way we can, with Submi&s;&s;ion to the Enquirer, it
was not a Reque&s;t he could think the Di&s;&s;enters, if in their Sen&s;es,
could give any An&s;wer to, the Propo&s;al favour'd of &s;omething not extra|ordinary
careful either of their Intere&s;t or Reputation, to &s;ay no wor&s;e
it; if there was any other De&s;ign, be that to the Contriver.</P>
<P>But to return to the Subject, we are happen'd into the World in an
Age when all &s;orts of Tyranny have met with their de&s;erv'd tho' mo&s;t
unexpected Fate.</P>
<P>Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Tyranny lies buryed in the Grave of the High Com|mi&s;&s;ion,
and Civil Tyranny in that of the late King <HI>James;</HI> the&s;e are both
&s;ucceeded by their Contraries, Toleration and Revolution, and we all tru&s;t
are buried too deep ever to ri&s;e more.</P>
<P>We have Attempts to de&s;troy them both, every day &s;et on foot a|mong
us; the Di&s;&s;enters are branded as Rebels, and con&s;tant Under|miners
of the Church; to divide them, they are rendred odious to one ano|ther;
the <HI>Prebyterians</HI> charg'd with Per&s;ecuting-Principles, the <HI>Indepen|dent</HI>
with Commonwealth Tenents, the <HI>Quakers</HI> unchri&s;tianiz'd, and
char'd with having no Principles at all; Snakes in the Gra&s;s are daily
Snarling, and private Animo&s;ities prompted among tho&s;e of every &s;ort,
who are weak enough to entertain them; and 'tis plain the De&s;ign lies
at the Body, the Axe lies at the Root of the Tree; the Overthrow of the
Con&s;titution is the De&s;ign, and the Enemies of the Di&s;&s;enters, as &s;uch,
have by too many vi&s;ible Tokens explain'd them&s;elves to mean the Sub|ver&s;ion
of the Univer&s;al Right of Chri&s;tians, and of Subjects.</P>
<P>For this the Doctrine of <HI>Jure Divino</HI> is calculated, Civil and Eccle|&s;ia&s;tick
Tyranny univer&s;ally pleaded for, and all &s;orts of Liberty run
down and oppos'd: Let tho&s;e that plead for Tyrants of any &s;ort &s;ubmit
to their Power; for my part, I e&s;teem the Liberty of E&s;tate and Religi|on,
equally with our Lives, every Man's Birthright by Nature; no Go|vernment
ever received a Legal Authority to abridge or take it away:
Nor has God ever ve&s;ted any &s;ingle or Confederated Power in any hand
to de&s;troy it; and 'tis in Defence of this Common Right that I have
wrote this Book.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;ay very little in Defence of the Performance, but this; It has
been wrote under the heavie&s;t Weight of intolerable Pre&s;&s;ures; the
greate&s;t part of it was compos'd in Pri&s;on, and as the Author has unhap|pily
felt the mo&s;t violent and con&s;tant Efforts of his Enemies to de&s;troy
him ever &s;ince that, the little Compo&s;ure he has had mu&s;t be his &s;hort
excu&s;e for any thing incorrect.</P>
<P>Let any Man, under Millions of di&s;tracting Cares, and the con&s;tant ill
Treatment of the World, con&s;ider the Power of &s;uch Circum&s;tances
over both Invention and Expre&s;&s;ion, He will allow I had been to be
excus'd, even in wor&s;e Errors than are to be found in this Book.</P>
<P><PB N="xxvi" REF="30">
I know &s;ome will cavil at the Title, and that it either has no literal
Signification, or <HI>is not good Latin;</HI> let &s;uch ob&s;erve, I could not part
with my Title in Civility to the Objection; and if it will not pa&s;s as a
Latin Sentence, it may pa&s;s as a proper Name or Title to a Book, or
a Phra&s;e added to the Tongue, &s;ignifying the vain Preten&s;ions of a Divine
Right; as the World has u&s;ed me very unkindly in the Sub&s;cribing-Part,
&s;o they have in their Character of the Work. I have heard of Plays that
have been hi&s;s'd and laugh'd off the Stage; but I never heard of a Play
hi&s;s'd off the Stage before it came upon the Stage.</P>
<P>This poor Work has met with the hard Fate of being reported to be
ill done, and the meane&s;t thing I ever did, and that it will not &s;ell, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
yet the Authors of that Report, to my Diver&s;ion as well as Remark
I ob&s;erve it, I am very po&s;itive, never &s;aw, read, or heard one
Line of it in their Lives; their Judgment, <HI>which must, you'll &s;ay, be very
good, and &s;uited to their Di&s;cretion,</HI> is, I thank God, none of my Con|cern.</P>
<P>I have indeed been forc'd into an open War with the Book&s;ellers about
this Book, having univer&s;ally refu&s;ed them &s;ub&s;cribing, &s;ome particular
Friends excepted; and in return I am a&s;&s;ur'd they will reprint it, and
&s;ell it for half the Money: Now to tell them that this is meer Theft,
picking of Pockets, robbing upon the High Way, and the like, is to tell
them nothing, but what they are reconcil'd to in practice; to call them
hard Names is what I am not u&s;ed to; they are Book&s;ellers: and that's
the highe&s;t <HI>Satyr</HI> I &s;hall make upon them.</P>
<P>But however, I am content; let them turn Pyrates, and take away my
Right, I have been us'd to be rob'd and plundred in every thing I have
u&s;hered into the World, that I might not at lea&s;t want the Principal
Qualification of a Poet&mdash;But let them be &s;ure of this, whoever at|tempts
it will lo&s;e by it&mdash;And let them take my word, or not take it,
as they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>As to the Poetical Part of it, where the Argument of it lies &s;trong,
I have been very carele&s;s of Cen&s;ure that way, and have often &s;acri|fic'd
the Poet to the Rea&s;oning Stile.</P>
<P>The Hi&s;torical Part, I think I may &s;ay, cannot admit of being very Po|etical;
but as I think it was equal to any of the re&s;t in its nece&s;&s;ity, I am
very well pleas'd to argue &s;trongly rather than &s;oftly.</P>
<P>I know I am under the &s;ame Cen&s;ure, tho' without his Merit to &s;up|port
me, that <HI>Cowley</HI>'s <HI>Davideis</HI> has &s;uffered before me, <HI>viz.</HI> that if it had
been explicit in it &s;elf, it had needed no Annotations; but I think the
nece&s;&s;ary Quotations of Hi&s;tory coming on very thick, I could not but
explain my meaning, whereby People of &s;mall Reading may exactly
under&s;tand it; the Annotations therefore are chiefly Hi&s;torical, and di|rect
and &s;erve to guide the Reader to the Authors which ju&s;tify the work;
and this I cho&s;e rather than to advance on my own Authority, what I
know will meet with Oppo&s;ition enough.</P>
<P>I am perfectly arm'd again&s;t Events in the Succe&s;s this Book &s;hall
meet with in the World; my Fate, and that of my Writings have been
very &s;ingular, <HI>viz.</HI> to be mo&s;t neglected of them, that at the &s;ame time
have own'd them u&s;eful; but as neither the Work nor its Author depend
upon any thing in this World; &s;o neither am I looking either at Prai&s;e
<PB N="xxvii" REF="31">
or Reward, and therefore am entirely unconcern'd at the Succe&s;s of
it.</P>
<P>I &s;hall quit therefore any farther Defence of it, and leave it to its Fate,
and the Univer&s;al Cen&s;ure of <HI>Criticks, Rehear&s;ers, Jacobites, Non-Jurors,</HI>
and the Crowd of <HI>Party-Furies,</HI> that wait to worry it, as they would do
its Author, and am plea&s;ed with, in&s;tead of being mortified at what my
Experience knows has been a ju&s;t Motto for me,
<Q><L>Aude aliquod brevibus Gyaris &amp; Carcere Dignum,</L>
<L>Si vis e&s;&s;e aliquis: <HI>PROBITAS</HI> laudatur &amp; Alget.</L>
Juven. Sat. 1. lin. 73, 74.</Q></P>
<P>I &s;hall clo&s;e this Preface with a Word to tho&s;e Gentlemen, who have
ill treated me for the Delay of bringing it into the World&mdash;In which
they have been very barbarous and uncivil, as well as unju&s;t.</P>
<P>All tho&s;e few and wi&s;er Heads that had any re&s;pect for the Author,
earne&s;tly pre&s;s'd me not to attempt it while the la&s;t Parliament was &s;it|ting,
Mea&s;ures having been taken, and the Party then powerful enough
to bla&s;t it in its Birth, &s;eize it in the Pre&s;s, and &s;uppre&s;s both it and
me together, by the heavy Weight of Parliamentary Cen&s;ure; and this
laid it a&s;leep a Year.</P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;ary Ob&s;truction of a 4 Months Travail defer'd it la&s;t Sum|mer,
being unwilling to let it pa&s;s the Pre&s;s unrevis'd; and from <HI>October</HI>
la&s;t, it has, thro' many Interruptions of private and publick Hurries,
been Pa&s;&s;ing the Pre&s;s.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e People who have open'd their Mouths at this Delay, to reproach
the Author with taking Sub&s;cription-Mony without any De&s;ign to publi&s;h
it, will now &s;ee how unju&s;t &s;o ra&s;h and &s;o &s;evere a Slander has been.</P>
<P>But above all, tho&s;e that have pretended to keep the Sub&s;cription-Money
they had received in their hands for a Security till they &s;hall have
the Book, have fir&s;t been very unju&s;t to the Author; and $word$, done
their be&s;t to prevent its being publi&s;h'd at all.</P>
<P>Sub&s;criptions are in their Nature de&s;ign'd for two ends; Fir&s;t, To en|able
the Authors by the Money advanc'd, to go thro' the Expence of Print|ing,
which every Man, that undertakes to publi&s;h a Book on his own
Ri&s;que, cannot do, nor which the&s;e Gentlemen did not know I could
do without them.</P>
<P>Secondly, To &s;ecure the Author that the Sub&s;cribers will take it when
'tis fini&s;hed, many People having lately learnt not to put too great
a Sanction, no not on their own hand, when they plea&s;e to alter their
Minds.</P>
<P>Both the&s;e Hard&s;hips are put upon me by the&s;e fal&s;e Friends, and yet
without their Help behold 'tis fini&s;hed; and They, not the Author, have
been guilty of de&s;igning a Fraud, if any has been de&s;ign'd at all.</P>
<P>As for tho&s;e who having &s;ub&s;crib'd and Honourably a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Au|thor
to go thro' with it, he hopes the Work it &s;elf will in Conjunction
with this Acknowledgment be their Satisfaction; and had they not ex|pre&s;ly
forbid it, he had both printed their Names, and made the Dedica|tion
of it to them, as Benefactors to it.</P>
<P>As to Sale, the Author entirely declines it; and tells the Gentlemen-Book&s;ellers
that threatned to Pyrate it, as they call it, <HI>viz.</HI> reprint it,
<PB N="xxviii" REF="32">
and &s;ell it for half a Crown; &s;o you mu&s;t, Gentlemen, if you intend to
have it: for of the Original Copies, if the Sub&s;cribers are hone&s;t, you will
have very few; and if all Men that write would take the &s;ame Method,
the Book&s;ellers would &s;oon leave off impo&s;ing upon them&mdash;</P>
<P>Some <HI>Addenda,</HI> not yet fini&s;hed, relating to the pre&s;ent Victories and
great Pro&s;pect of reducing Tyrrany, will be deliver'd <HI>gratis</HI> to the Sub|&s;cribers,
either early enough to bind with this, if they plea&s;e; or pre|par'd
to be read by them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I don't expect the Advocates of Tyranny &s;hould like it; it was not
wrote to gratify them, but convince them; and therefore all their Re|proaches,
and all their Fury at the Author will be perfectly lo&s;t; he is
prepar'd to contemn them, as they de&s;erve.</P>

CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<LIST>
<ITEM>THE Introduction to the Work.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>LIB.</HI> I. A Satyrical Allu&s;ion to the Heathen Gods, who
are &s;uppos'd to have been all of them Kings or famous Men in
their Time, and fabl'd into Deities by the Error and Ignorance
of tho&s;e Days; concluding with a Li&s;t of Great but Vicious
Princes in our Modern times, fit to make Gods of in the next
Promotion.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. The Allu&s;ion brought down to the Kings below, who are call'd
God's too in the Scripture: Their Original Power examin'd
from its Patriarchal In&s;titution; and joyning in Societies for
mutual Defence prov'd to be the General Act, even of tho&s;e
Patriarchs them&s;elves; &s;o that the Right of the People Go|vern'd,
is plain from that very Foundation laid to oppo&s;e it;
the Story Illu&s;trated from <HI>Saul,</HI> who tho' Anointed by <HI>Samuel,</HI>
was not Crown'd till the Con&s;ent of the People was obtain'd.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. An Enquiry why God in his Providence gives Power to wick|ed
Men, and while he puni&s;hes private Murthers and Inju&s;tice,
leaves the World at the Mercy of Tyrants to ravage and de&s;troy
it at their Plea&s;ure; a Proof that he left Mens Liberty a Tru&s;t
to them to pre&s;erve and defend, and gave them the u&s;e of their
Rea&s;on to that purpo&s;e.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. A Search into the Laws of Cu&s;tom for the Divine Right of
Princes; and among the rest, &s;ome <HI>Satyr</HI> on the Cu&s;tom of
tho&s;e Gentlemen here that preach up this Doctrine, exemplified
in their Treatment of the late King <HI>James;</HI> their fir&s;t &s;wearing,
and per&s;wading him to believe that they would pay an undi&s;pu|ted
Obedience to him, expo&s;ed, as a greater Treachery than their
de&s;erting him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>V. A Retro&s;pect on the earlie&s;t time; Property prov'd the true and
only Original of Power. The Story of <HI>Rehoboam,</HI> and the
Ten Tribes, Satyrically methodiz'd; a Hymn to Liberty.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB REF="34">
VI. A Draft of Tyranny, and an Enquiry from the Nature of
it, if it ought not to be Re&s;i&s;ted; an Excur&s;ion here on the
Laws of God, Nature, and Rea&s;on, concurring to re&s;ist Op|pre&s;&s;ion.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VII.
A Search into Hi&s;tory; affirming, That all Nations, and
in all Ages, have made it a con&s;tant Practice to Dethrone Ty|rants,
and Defend their Liberty, and Examples brought from
Antiquity to prove this A&s;&s;ertion; an Excur&s;ion to Home Af|fairs
and Per&s;ons.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VIII. The Search into Hi&s;tory continued, with Remarks on the In|troduction
of Tyrranny and Idolatry hand in hand into the
World; an Encomium on <HI>Arbaces,</HI> the fir&s;t Man that ever
took up Arms for Liberty, and Dethron'd a Monarch; the
<HI>Median</HI> Monarchy examin'd, and prov'd Limited and Regu|lated
by the People, and &V;niver&s;al Hi&s;tory unravell'd for Ex|amples
of Tyrants Depo&s;ed.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IX. An Hi&s;torical Search into the Pretended Succe&s;&s;ion of Kings by
Divine Right, and the &s;purious irregular De&s;cent of all the
Kings in the World, made out in order Explode the fooli&s;h No|tion
of Divine Succe&s;&s;ion.</ITEM>
<ITEM>X. The &s;ame continued and brought Home to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Lines,
from the <HI>Saxon</HI> Race to the Pre&s;ent Reign.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XI. A Panygerick on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Happy Con&s;titution, depending
neither on Per&s;ons nor Race, but upon the Laws and Limitations
of Government.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XII. The like on the Per&s;on of the Queen, her Government, and
Nobility.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Conclu&s;ion to the Queen.</ITEM>

<P>He that when he is argued again&s;t, can an&s;wer with his Sword in&s;tead of his Pen has certainly a full power in his hand to confirm this Doctrine, and need no other Method; nor is it any other way to be defended: When therefore they found <HI>Algernoon Sidney</HI>'s Argument unan&s;werable by Words, the only way left them was to lay a&s;ide debating with the Book, and fall upon the Man&mdash;So they cut off his Head, meerly be|cau&s;e they could not an&s;wer his Book.</P>

<P>And to confirm this, and prove that it is no forc't Con&s;truction, &s;ee the next Words, <HI>v.</HI> 9. <HI>WHEREFORE King</HI> Darius <HI>&s;igned the Writing, and the Decree,</HI> even for that Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Now ob&s;erve the Treatment the&s;e People gave their King, upon the ripening of the Plot. They find <HI>Daniel</HI> praying, as they knew before they &s;hould, at the Window of his Chamber looking towards <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> as was the Cu&s;tom of their Country, from the Words of <HI>Solomon,</HI> in the Dedication of the Temple, <HI>Hearken thou to the Supplication of thy People</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>when they &s;hall pray towards this Place,</HI> 1 Kings 8. 30. away they go to the King, and fir&s;t demand a Recognition of the Law from him, <HI>v.</HI> 12. <HI>Then they came near, and &s;pake before the King, concerning the King's Decree, Ha&s;t thou not &s;igned a Decree, that every Man that &s;hall ask a Petition of any God or Man, within thirty Days, &s;ave of thee, O King, &s;hall be ca&s;t into the Den of Lions.</HI></P>
<P>Well, &s;ays the King, I have, and you know when it is done, I cannot undo it, but, <HI>According to the Law of the</HI> Medes <HI>and</HI> Per&s;ians, <HI>it altereth not.</HI> Then they tell him the Story of <HI>Daniel,</HI> how he had not regarded the Law, nor the King's &s;igning it, <HI>v.</HI> 13th.</P>
<P>Now ob&s;erve the King's Conduct, <HI>v.</HI> 15. <HI>then the King, when he heard the&s;e things, was &s;ore di&s;plea&s;ed with him&s;elf,</HI> i.e. for pa&s;&s;ing &s;uch a Law un|advi&s;edly, without making &s;ome <HI>Provi&s;o,</HI> or Exception, for his belov'd <HI>Daniel, and he &s;et his Heart on</HI> Daniel, <HI>to deliver him, and he labour'd to the going down of the Sun to deliver him.</HI> This Pa&s;&s;age is a mo&s;t &s;ignificant Ex|pre&s;&s;ion of the Extremity of the King's Affairs, and how he labour'd be|tween the Affection he had for the Prophet, and his Re&s;pect for the Law.</P>
<P>He labour'd till Sun &s;et, where we may &s;uppo&s;e, <HI>I believe, without any Arrogance,</HI> that he labour'd by per&s;wading the Great Men to &s;pare him; it is plain he did not labour with him&s;elf to be willing and ea&s;ie to deliver him up, but the Words are expre&s;s, <HI>he labour'd to deliver him.</HI></P>
<P>Note here, the King had no di&s;pen&s;ing Power, the Criminal the Law condemns, mu&s;t be executed, even the King him&s;elf could not reprieve him.</P>
<P>And tho' the King &s;u&s;pended the Execution but one Day, &s;ee the Un|wearine&s;s and Clamour is rai&s;ed, <HI>THEN,</HI> that is at the going down of the Sun, <HI>the&s;e Men a&s;&s;embled unto the King.</HI> Now mark the Empha&s;is, they do not come with another humble Addre&s;s to his Maje&s;ty, that the Laws might be put in Execution, but they come with a Claim of Right, <HI>KNOW, O KING, that the Laws of the</HI> Medes <HI>and</HI> Per&s;ians <HI>is, that no Decree, or Statute, which the King e&s;tabli&s;heth may be changed,</HI> as if they had &s;aid, Sir we come to demand our Rights and Liberties, according to the known Laws of this Land, and to tell you Sir, that to di&s;pence with the Laws of the Land is illegal, and is not in your Power. The King took their meaning pre&s;ently, and knowing he could not contend with them, or in meer Veneration to the mo&s;t Sacred Authority of the Law, gives them no An&s;wer, but delivers up <HI>Daniel</HI> to their Mercy.</P>
<P>His Concern for him when he was in his Enemies Hands, appears, <HI>v.</HI> 18. <HI>Then the King went to his Palace, and pa&s;&s;ed the Night fa&s;ting, nei|ther were the In&s;truments of Mu&s;tck brought before him, and his Sleep went from him.</HI> Here's his Concern for him illu&s;trated farther, by his running to the Den of Lyons, in the Morning, to know how it had far'd with him: His Joy at his Knowledge of his Deliverance; and his &s;evere Revenge upon his Accu&s;ers, as may be &s;een at large, <HI>v.</HI> 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.</P>
<P>Here's an Original Monarch, who&s;e &s;acred ab&s;olute Power and Domi|nion could not &s;ave a Favourite from the Force of the Law, tho' fal&s;ly accu&s;ed. Here is the due Sovereignty of the Law &s;o acknowledg'd, and &s;o recogi&s;ed, as no Prince in <HI>Europe</HI> could &s;toop to.</P>
<P>Not King <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t parted with his beloved <HI>Strafford;</HI> not <HI>Charles</HI> the Second with the <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> Act and <HI>Star-Chamber;</HI> not King <HI>James</HI> with his Crown or King <HI>William</HI> with his Blue-Guards, with a fortieth Part of the Reluctance; but the Law was pa&s;s'd, and the King had no Power to alter or &s;u&s;pend it.</P>
<P>Thus the Superiority of the Law, to Kingly Power, was acknowledg'd in the <HI>Median</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Monarchy, and King <HI>Darius,</HI> tho' as potent a Prince as mo&s;t that ever reign'd, vail'd his Crown to the Regency of Law and acknowledg'd him&s;elf unable to alter it, or &s;u&s;pend its Execution.</P></NOTE> di&s;dain'd not to &s;ubmit:</L>
