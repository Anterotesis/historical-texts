<LETTER>
<PB N="2" REF="8">
<OPENER>Cou&s;in Pickle,</OPENER>
<P>I Hope you are in a better trim than your aunt'
who hath been fa&s;t moored to her bed the&s;e
&s;even weeks, by &s;everal feet of under-water log|ging
in her hold and hollop, whereby I doubt her
planks are rotted, &s;o as &s;he cannot chu&s;e but
fall to pieces in a &s;hort time. I have done all in
my power to keep her tight and ea&s;y, and free
from &s;udden &s;qualls that might over&s;train her.
And here have been the doctors, who have
&s;kuttled her lower deck, and let out &s;ix gallons
water. For my own part, I wonder how the devil
it came there; for you know as how it was a li|quor
&s;he never took in. But as for tho&s;e fellows
the doctors, they are like un&s;kilful carpenters,
that in mending one leak, make a couple; and
to &s;he fills again apace But the wor&s;t &s;ign of all
is this here, &s;he won't let a drop of Nantz go be|twixt
the combings of her teeth, and has quite
lo&s;t the rudder of her under&s;tanding, whereby
&s;he yaws woundily in her &s;peech, palavering
about &s;ome foreign part called the New Geereu|&s;alem,
and wi&s;hing her&s;elf in a &s;afe birth in the
river Geordun. The par&s;on, I mu&s;t &s;ay, &s;trives
to keep her &s;teady, concerning the navigation of
her &s;oul, and talks very &s;en&s;ibly of charity and the
poor, whereof &s;he hath left a legacy of two hun|dred
pounds in her will. And here has been Mr.
Gamaliel and your brother my lord, demanding
entrance at the gate, in order to &s;ee her; but
I would not &s;uffer them to come aboard, and
pointed my patereroes, which made them &s;heer
off. Your &s;i&s;ter Mrs. Clover keeps clo&s;e watch
upon her kin&s;woman, without ever turning in,
and a kind-hearted young woman it is. I &s;hould
<PB N="3" REF="9">
be glad to &s;ee you at the gari&s;on, if the wind of
your inclination fits that way; and mayhap it
may be a comfort to your aunt, to behold you
along-&s;ide of her, when her anchor is apeak. So
no more at pre&s;ent, but re&s;ts</P>
<CLOSER>Your friend
And humble &s;ervant to command,
<SIGNED>Jno HATCHWAY.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Next morning, after the receipt of this epi&s;tle,
Peregrine, in order to manife&s;t his regard to his
aunt, as well as his friend&s;hip for hone&s;t Jack,
&s;et out on hor&s;eback for their habitation, at|tended
by Pipes, who longed to &s;ee his old me&s;s|mate;
but, before he reached the gari&s;on, Mrs.
Hatchway had given up the gho&s;t, in the three-&s;core
and fifth year of her age. The widower
&s;eemed to bear his lo&s;s with re&s;ignation, and be|haved
very decently upon the occa&s;ion, though
he did not undergo tho&s;e dangerous tran&s;ports of
&s;orrow, which &s;ome tender-hearted hu&s;bands have
&s;elt at the departure of their yoke-fellows. The
lieutenant was naturally a philo&s;opher, and &s;o
well di&s;po&s;ed to acquie&s;ce in the di&s;pen&s;ations of
providence, that in this, as well as in every other
emergency of his life, he firmly believed, that
every thing which happened was for the be&s;t.</P>
<P>Peregrine's ta&s;k, therefore, was not &s;o great in
comforting him, as in con&s;oling his own &s;i&s;ter,
who with great poignancy and &s;incerity of grief,
lamented the death of the only relation with
whom &s;he had maintained any intimacy of cor|re&s;pondence;
for her mother was as implacable as
ever, in her enmity again&s;t her and Peregrine,
<PB N="4" REF="10">
and rather more determined in her rancour,
that which was originally a &s;udden tran&s;port of
indignation, being by this time &s;ettled into a
confirmed inveteracy of hate. As for Gam,
who was now dignified by the country-people
with the appellation of the young &s;quire, he &s;till
acted in the capacity of mini&s;ter to the caprice
and vengeance of his mother, taking all oppor|tunities
of di&s;turbing Julia's peace, &s;landering her
reputation, and committing outrages again&s;t the
tenants and dome&s;tics of her hu&s;band, who was
a man of a quiet and timorous di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>But the chief amu&s;ement of young Pickle, in
his later years, was the chace, in which he ac|quired
&s;ome renown by his intrepidity and re|markable
figure, which improved every day in de|formity;
in&s;omuch, as to &s;ugge&s;t a ludicrous
&s;cheme of revenge to a gentleman in the neigh|bourhood,
who having been affronted by the in|&s;olence
of Crookback, cloathed a large baboon
that was in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, in a dre&s;s that re|&s;embled
the hunting-equipage of Gam; and or|dering
the animal to be &s;et a&s;tride, and tied upon
the back of his keene&s;t hunter, turned them out
one day after the hounds; and the hor&s;e in a little
time out&s;tripping all the re&s;t in the field, the
rider was mi&s;taken for Gam by the whole com|pany,
who &s;aluted him as he pa&s;&s;ed with a hol|low,
ob&s;erving, that the &s;quire had his u&s;ual good
luck, in being better mounted than his neigh|bours.
Pickle afterwards appearing in his own
per&s;on, created great a&s;toni&s;hment in the &s;pecta|tors,
one of whom a&s;ked if he had &s;plit him&s;elf
in twain, and pointed out his repre&s;entative, who
was by this time almo&s;t up with the hounds:
upon which, the identical Gam went in pur&s;uit
<PB N="5" REF="11">
of the impo&s;tor; and when he overtook him was
&s;o much enraged at the counterfeit, that he at|tacked
the baboon whip in hand, and, in all pro|bability,
would have &s;acrificed him to his re&s;ent|ment,
had not he been prevented by the other
foxhunters, who interpo&s;ed, in order to make up
the difference betwixt two brothers of the &s;port,
and were equally &s;urpri&s;ed and diverted, when
they di&s;tingui&s;hed the quality of Crookback's an|tagoni&s;t,
which they re&s;cued from his rage, and
reconveyed to its ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Peregrine, at the reque&s;t of his friend Jack,
took charge of his aunt's funeral, to which his
parents were invited, though they did not think
proper to appear, or pay the lea&s;t regard to his
&s;ollicitations, when he de&s;ired permi&s;&s;ion to wait
upon them in per&s;on. Neverthele&s;s, old Gama|liel,
at the in&s;tigation of his wife, afterwards ob|tained
an order from Doctor's Commons, oblig|ing
Hatchway to produce the will of his wife, on
the &s;uppo&s;ition that &s;he had bequeathed to him
&s;ome part of the money which (&s;he knew) was at
her own di&s;po&s;al. But from this &s;tep he reaped
no other &s;atisfaction than that of finding him&s;elf
altogether neglected by the te&s;tatrix, who had
left all her effects to her hu&s;band, except one
thou&s;and pounds, with her jewels, to Julia's
daughter, the benefaction mentioned in the lieu|tenant's
letter, and &s;ome incon&s;iderable legacies
to her favourite dome&s;ticks.</P>
<P>A few days after the interment of this good
lady, our hero was agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed with a vi|&s;it
from his friend Godfrey, who had come to
England in con&s;equence of that promotion which
he owed to his intere&s;t, tho' the &s;oldier him&s;elf
placed it to the credit of a certain courtier who
<PB N="6" REF="12">
had formerly promi&s;ed to befriend him, and now
finding his advancement unowned, very mode&s;t|ly
arrogated the merit of it to him&s;elf. He com|municated
his good fortune to Pickle, who com|plimented
him upon it as an event of which he
had no precognition; and at the &s;ame time told
him, that, in con&s;equence of his preferment, his
co$&s;in at Wind&s;or had con&s;ented to his being im|mediately
united in the bands of wedlock with his
lovely Sophy; that the wedding-day was already
fixed; and that nothing would be wanting to his
happine&s;s, if Peregrine would honour the nup|ti$ls
with his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>Our hero accepted the invitation with great
eagerne&s;s, when he learned that Emilia would be
there in quality of bride's maid; and now repeat|ed
what he had formerly written to his friend,
namely, that he was not only willing, but ex|tremely
impatient to attone for his mad behaviour
to that young lady, by laying him&s;elf and his
whole fortune at her feet. Godfrey thanked him
for his honourable intention, and promi&s;ed to u&s;e
his influence, and that of Sophy, in his behalf,
tho' he &s;eemed dubious of their &s;ucce&s;s, on ac|count
of his &s;i&s;ter's delicacy, which could not
pardon the lea&s;t &s;hadow of di&s;re&s;pect. He owned,
indeed, he was not certain that &s;he would appear
in the &s;ame company with Pickle; but as &s;he had
made no &s;tipulations on that &s;core, he would in|terpret
her &s;ilence in the mo&s;t favourable man|ner,
and keep her in ignorance of his de&s;ign, un|til
&s;he &s;hould find it too late to retract with any
decency. The hope of &s;eeing and conver&s;ing
with Emilia, and perhaps of being reconciled to
her, after having &s;uffered &s;o much and &s;o long
from her di&s;plea&s;ure, rai&s;ed a tumult of ideas in
<PB N="7" REF="13">
his brea&s;t, and produced a &s;trange inquietude of
joy and perturbation. Gauntlet having &s;tayed
with him a few days, and &s;ignified the time ap|pointed
for his &s;pou&s;als, took his leave, in order
to prepare for the occa&s;ion; while Peregrine,
with his friend Hatchway, made a tour among his
acquaintance in the country, with a view of
founding their inclinations touching a project
which he had lately conceived, of offering him|&s;elf
as a candidate for a certain borough in the
neighbourhood, at the en&s;uing election for mem|bers
of parliament.</P>
<P>This &s;cheme, which was &s;ugge&s;ted to him by
one of his quality patrons, would have &s;ucceeded
according to his wi&s;h, had the election taken
place immediately; but before that happened, his
intere&s;t was overbalanced by &s;ome &s;mall accidents
that will be recorded in the &s;equel. In the mean
time, he repaired to Wind&s;or on the eve of his
friend's marriage, and under&s;tood from Godfrey,
that it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty he and So|phy
could prevail upon his &s;i&s;ter to be pre&s;ent at
the wedding, when &s;he was informed that her
lover was invited, and that her con&s;ent had not
been obtained until they had promi&s;ed, on the
part of Peregrine, that he &s;hould not renew the
old topic, nor even &s;peak to her in the &s;tile of a
former acquaintance.</P>
<P>Our young gentleman was nettled at this pre|liminary,
to which, however, he &s;aid he would
adhere; and &s;o well did he think him&s;elf fortified
with pride and re&s;entment, that he re&s;olved to
behave towards her with &s;uch indifference, as
would, he hoped, mortify her vanity, and there|by
puni&s;h her for the implacability of her di&s;po|&s;ition.
Armed with the&s;e &s;entiments, he was
<PB N="8" REF="14">
next day introduced by God&s;rey to the bride,
who received him with her u&s;ual &s;weetne&s;s of
temper and affability; and Emilia being pre&s;ent,
he &s;aluted her with a di&s;tant bow, which &s;he ac|knowledged
with a cold curt'&s;y, and an a&s;pect of
ice. Tho' this deportment confirmed his di&s;|plea&s;ure,
her beauty undermined his re&s;olution;
he thought her charms were infinitely improved
&s;ince their la&s;t parting, and a thou&s;and fond ima|ges
recurring to his imagination, he felt his whole
&s;oul di&s;&s;olving into tenderne&s;s and love.</P>
<P>In order to bani&s;h tho&s;e dangerous ideas, he
endeavoured to enter into a gay conver&s;ation
with Sophy, on the &s;ubject of the approaching
ceremony; but his tongue performed its office
very aukwardly, his eyes were attracted towards
Emilia, as if they had been &s;ubject to the power
of fa&s;cination; in &s;pite of all his efforts, a deep
&s;igh e&s;caped from his bo&s;om, and his whole ap|pearance
indicated anxiety and confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The bridegroom perceiving his condition,
abridged the vi&s;it, and having conducted his
companion to his own lodgings, expre&s;&s;ed his
concern at having been the innocent occa&s;ion of
his unea&s;ine&s;s, by expo&s;ing him to the fight of
Emilia, which he perceived had given him pain.
Peregrine, who had by this time recollected the
dictates of his pride, a&s;&s;ured him, that he was
very much mi&s;taken in the cau&s;e of his di&s;order,
which was no other than a &s;udden qualm, to
which he had been for &s;ome time &s;ubject; and to
&s;hew him how philo&s;ophically he could bear the
di&s;cain of Emilia, which, with all deference to
her conduct, he could not help thinking a little
too &s;evere, he de&s;ired, as the bridegroom had
made preparations for a private ball in the even|ing,
<PB N="9" REF="15">
that he would provide him with an agree|able
partner; in which ca&s;e he would exhibit un|doubted
proofs of the tranquillity of his heart. &startq;I
was in hopes (an&s;wered Godfrey) of being able,
with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Sophy,&endq; to make up matters
between you and my &s;i&s;ter, and for that rea&s;on
kept her unengaged to any other gentleman for
the night; but &s;ince &s;he is &s;o peevi&s;hly ob&s;tinate,
I &s;hall take care to accommodate you with a very
hand&s;ome young lady, who&s;e partner will not be
&s;orry to exchange her for Emilia.</P>
<P>The thoughts of having an opportunity to co|quet
with another woman, under the eye of this
implacable mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;upported his &s;pirits during
the ceremony which put Gauntlet in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
his heart's de&s;ire; and, by means of this cordial,
he found him&s;elf &s;o undi&s;turbed at dinner, tho'
he &s;at oppo&s;ite to his fair enemy, that he was able
to pa&s;s &s;ome occa&s;ional jokes upon the new-married
couple, with &s;ome appearance of mirth
and good humour. Nor did Emily any other|wi&s;e
&s;eem affected by his pre&s;ence, than by ex|cepting
him from the participation of tho&s;e geni|al
regards which &s;he di&s;tributed to the re&s;t of the
company. This ea&s;ine&s;s of behaviour on her
&s;ide, reinforced his re&s;olution, by giving him
pretence to call her &s;en&s;ibility in que&s;tion; for he
could not conceive how any woman of acute
feelings could &s;it unmoved, in pre&s;ence of a man
with whom &s;he had &s;uch recent and intimate con|nexion:
not con&s;idering, that &s;he had much more
rea&s;on to condemn his affectation of unconcern,
and that her external deportment might, like his
own, be an effort of pride and re&s;entment.</P>
<P>This conte&s;t, in point of di&s;&s;imulation, conti|nued
till night, when the company was paired
<PB N="10" REF="16">
for dancing, and Peregrine began the ball by
walking a minuet with the bride; then he took
out the young lady to whom he was recommend|ed
by Gauntlet, being very well plea&s;ed to &s;ee
that her per&s;on was &s;uch as might have in&s;pired
even Emily her&s;elf with jealou&s;y, though, at the
&s;ame time, he perceived his mi&s;tre&s;s coupled
with a gay young officer, whom (with all due
deference to his own qualifications) he con&s;idered
as no de&s;picable rival. However, he him&s;elf fir&s;t
began ho&s;tilities, by becoming all of a &s;udden
particular with his partner, whom he forthwith
a&s;&s;ailed with flattering compliments, that &s;oon
introduced the &s;ubject of love, upon which he
expatiated with great art and elocution, u&s;ing not
only the faculty of &s;peech, but al&s;o the language
of the eyes, in which he was a perfect con|noi&s;&s;eur.</P>
<P>This behaviour &s;oon manife&s;ted it&s;elf to the
whole a&s;&s;embly, the greate&s;t part of whom be|lieved
that he was in good earne&s;t captivated by
the heart of his partner, while Emilia, penetrat|ing
into his de&s;ign, turned his own artillery upon
him&s;elf, by &s;eeming to li&s;ten with plea&s;ure to the
addre&s;&s;es of his rival, who was no novice in the
art of making love: &s;he even affected uncommon
vivacity, and giggled aloud at every whi&s;per
which he conveyed into her ear, in&s;omuch that
&s;he, in her turn, afforded &s;peculation to the com|pany,
who imagined the young &s;oldier had made
a conque&s;t of the bridegroom's &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Pickle him&s;elf began to cheri&s;h the &s;ame opi|nion,
which gradually invaded his good humour,
and, at length, filled his bo&s;om with rage. He
&s;trove to &s;uppre&s;s his indignation, and called
every con&s;ideration of vanity and revenge to his
<PB N="11" REF="17">
aid: he endeavoured to wean his eyes from the
fatal object that di&s;turbed him, but they would
not obey his direction and command; he wi&s;hed
him&s;elf deprived of all &s;en&s;ation, when he heard
her laugh, and &s;aw her &s;mile upon the officer;
and, in the cour&s;e of country-dancing, when he
was obliged to join hands with her, the touch
thrill'd thro' all his nerves, and kindled a flame
within him which he could not contain. In a
word, his endeavours to conceal the &s;ituation of
his thoughts, were &s;o violent, that his con&s;titu|tion
could not endure the &s;hock; the &s;weat ran
down his forehead in a &s;tream, the colour va|ni&s;hed
from his cheeks, his knees began to totter,
and his eye&s;ight to fail: &s;o that he mu&s;t have
fallen at his full length upon the floor, had not
he retired very abruptly into another room, where
he threw him&s;elf upon a couch, and fainted.</P>
<P>In this condition he was found by his friend,
who &s;eeing him withdraw with &s;uch &s;ymptoms of
di&s;order, followed him thither; and when he re|covered
the u&s;e of his faculties, pre&s;&s;ed him to
make u&s;e of a bed in that hou&s;e, rather than ex|po&s;e
him&s;elf to the night air, by $word$ home to
his own lodgings: but not $word$ prevail
upon him to accept the offer, he $word$ $im
up in a cloak, and conducting him to $word$
where he lodged, helped him to undre&s; $$$word$
to bed, where he was immediately $word$ with a
violent fit of the ague. Godfrey beh$ved with
great tenderne&s;s, and would have actually $ore
him company all night, notwith&s;tanding the cir|cum&s;tances
of his own &s;ituation, had not his
friend in&s;i&s;ted upon his returning to the company,
and making his apology to his partner for his &s;ud|den
departure.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="18">
This was a &s;tep ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary towards
maintaining the quiet of the a&s;&s;embly, which he
found in great con&s;ternation, occa&s;ioned by his
ab&s;ence; for &s;ome of the ladies &s;eeing the bride|groom
follow the &s;tranger in his retreat, the
meaning of which they did not comprehend, be|gan
to be afraid of a quarrel; and Emilia, upon
pretence of that &s;uppo&s;ition, was &s;o much alarm|ed,
that &s;he could not &s;tand, and was fain to
have recour&s;e to a &s;melling bottle.</P>
<P>The bride, who under&s;tood the whole my|&s;tery,
was the only per&s;on that acted with deli|beration
and compo&s;ure; &s;he imputed Emilia's
di&s;order to the right cau&s;e, which was no other
than concern for the condition of her lover, and
a&s;&s;ured the ladies there was nothing extraordinary
in Mr. Pickle's going off, he being &s;ubject to
fainting fits, by which he was often overtaken
without any previous notice. The arrival of
Gauntlet confirmed the truth of this declaration;
he made an apology to the company, in the name
of his friend, who, he told them, was &s;uddenly
taken ill; and they returned to their diver&s;ion of
dancing, with this variation: Emilia was &s;o di&s;|ordered
and fatigued, that &s;he begged to be ex|cu&s;ed
from continuing the exerci&s;e; and Pere|grine's
partner being di&s;engaged, was paired with
the young officer for whom &s;he was originally
de&s;igned.</P>
<P>Mean while, the bride withdrew into another
apartment, with her &s;i&s;ter, and expo&s;tulated with
her upon her cruelty to Mr. Pickle, a&s;&s;uring her,
from Godfrey's information, that he had under|gone
a &s;evere fit on her account, which, in all
likelihood, would have a dangerous effect upon
his con&s;titution. Tho' Emily was inflexible in
<PB N="13" REF="19">
her an&s;wers to the kind remon&s;trances of the
gentle Sophy, her heart was melting with the
impre&s;&s;ions of pity and love; and finding her&s;elf
unable to perform the duty of her function, in
putting the bride to bed, &s;he retired to her own
chamber, and, in &s;ecret, &s;ympathized with the
di&s;temper of her lover.</P>
<P>In the morning, as early as decency would
permit him to leave the arms of his dear wife,
captain Gauntlet made a vi&s;it to Peregrine, who
had pa&s;&s;ed a very tedious and unea&s;y night, hav|ing
been &s;ubject to &s;hort intervals of delirium,
during which Pipes had found it very difficult to
keep him fa&s;t belayed. He owned indeed to
Godfrey, that his imagination had been haunted
by the ideas of Emilia and her officer, which tor|mented
him to an un&s;peakable degree of angui&s;h
and di&s;traction; and that he would rather &s;uffer
death than a repetition of &s;uch excruciating re|flections.
He was, however, comforted by his
friend, who a&s;&s;ured him, that his &s;i&s;ter's inclina|tions
would, in time, prevail over all the endea|vours
of re&s;entment and pride, illu&s;trating this
a&s;&s;everation by an account of the manner in which
&s;he was affected by the knowledge of his di&s;order,
and advi&s;ing him to implore the mediation of So|phy,
in a letter which &s;he &s;hould communicate
to Emilia.</P>
<P>This was an opportunity which our hero
thought too favourable to be neglected; and
therefore calling for paper, he &s;at up in his bed,
and, in the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of his emotion, wrote
the following petition to Godfrey's amiable
wife.</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="14" REF="20">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE affliction of a contrite heart can never
appeal to your benevolence in vain; and
therefore I pre&s;ume to approach you, in this &s;ea|&s;on
of delight, with the language of &s;orrow, re|que&s;ting
that you will e&s;pou&s;e the cau&s;e of an un|happy
lover, who mourns with unutterable an|gui&s;h
over his ruined hope, and interceed for my
pardon with that divine creature, whom, in the
intemperance and exce&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion, I have &s;o mor|tally
offended. Good heaven! is my guilt in|expiable?
Am I excluded from all hope of re|mi&s;&s;ion?
Am I devoted to mi&s;ery and de&s;pair?
I have offered all the atonement which the mo&s;t
perfect and &s;incere penitence could &s;ugge&s;t, and
&s;he rejects my humility and repentance. If her
re&s;entment would pur&s;ue me to the grave, let her
&s;ignify her plea&s;ure; and may I be branded with
the name of villain, and remembered with in|famy
and dete&s;tation to all po&s;terity, if I he&s;itate
one moment in &s;acrificing a life which is odious
to Emilia. Ah! madam, while I thus pour forth
the effu&s;ions of my grief and di&s;traction, I look
around the apartment in which I lie, and every
well-known object that &s;alutes my view, recals
to my remembrance that fond, that happy day,
on which the fair, the good, the tender hearted
Sophy became my advocate, though I was a
&s;tranger to her acquaintance, and effected a
tran&s;porting reconciliation between me and
that &s;ame inchanting beauty, that is now &s;o
implacably incen&s;ed. If &s;he is not &s;atisfied
with the pangs of remor&s;e and di&s;appointment,
the tran&s;ports of m$ dne&s;s I have undergone; let
her pre&s;cribe what farther penance &s;he thinks I
<PB N="15" REF="21">
ought to endure; and when I decline her &s;en|tence,
let me be the object of her eternal di&s;dain.</P>
<P>I commit my&s;elf, dear madam! dear Sophy!
dear partner of my friend! to your kind inter|po&s;ition.
I know you will manage my cau&s;e, as
a concern on which my happine&s;s intirely de|pends;
and I hope every thing from your com|pa&s;&s;ion
and benefience, while I fear every thing
from her rigour and barbarity. Yes! I call it
barbarity, a &s;avagene&s;s of delicacy altogether in|con&s;i&s;tent
with the tenderne&s;s of human nature;
and may the mo&s;t abject contempt be my por|tion,
if I live under its infliction! But I begin
to rave. I conjure you by your own humanity
and &s;weetne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, I conjure you by
your love for the man whom heaven hath de|creed
your protector, to employ your influence
with that angel of wrath, in behalf of</P>
<CLOSER>Your obliged and
Obedient &s;ervant,
<SIGNED>P. PICKLE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>This epi&s;tle was immediately tran&s;mitted by
Godfrey to his wife, who peru&s;ed it with marks
of the mo&s;t humane &s;ympathy; and carrying it
into her &s;i&s;ter's chamber, &startq;Here is &s;omething
(&s;aid &s;he, pre&s;enting the paper) which I mu&s;t re|commend
to your &s;erious attention.&endq; Emilia,
who immediately gue&s;&s;ed the meaning of this ad|dre&s;s,
ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to look upon it, or even
to hear it read, till her brother entering the apart|ment,
reprimanded her &s;harply for her ob&s;tinacy
and pride, accu&s;ed her of &s;oily and di&s;&s;imulation,
and entered &s;o warmly into the intere&s;ts of his
<PB N="16" REF="22">
friend, that &s;he thought him unkind in his re|mon&s;trances,
and bur&s;ting into a flood of tears,
reproached him with partiality and want of af|fection.
Godfrey, who entertained the mo&s;t
perfect love and veneration for his &s;i&s;ter, a&s;ked
pardon for having given offence, and ki&s;&s;ing the
drops from her fair eyes, begg'd &s;he would, for
his &s;ake, li&s;ten to the declaration of his friend.</P>
<P>Thus &s;ollicited, &s;he could not refu&s;e to hear
the letter, which when he had repeated, &s;he la|mented
her own fate, in being the occa&s;ion of &s;o
much unea&s;ine&s;s, de&s;ired her brother to a&s;&s;ure Mr.
Pickle, that &s;he was not a voluntary enemy to
his peace; on the contrary, &s;he wi&s;hed him all
happine&s;s, tho' &s;he hoped he would not blame
her for con&s;ulting her own, in avoiding any fu|ture
explanation or connexion with a per&s;on
who&s;e corre&s;pondence &s;he found her&s;elf under a
nece&s;&s;ity to renounce.</P>
<P>In vain did the new-married couple exhau&s;t
their eloquence in attempting to prove, that the
reparation which our hero had offered was ade|quate
to the injury &s;he had &s;u&s;tained; that in re|conciling
her&s;elf to a penitent lover, who &s;ub|&s;cribed
to her own terms of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, her ho|nour
would be acquitted by the mo&s;t &s;crupulous
and &s;evere judges of decorum; and that her in|flexibility
would be ju&s;tly a&s;cribed to the pride
and in&s;en&s;ibility of her heart. She turned a deaf
ear to all their arguments, exhortations and in|treaties,
and threatened to leave the hou&s;e im|mediately,
if they would not promi&s;e to drop that
&s;ubject of di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Godfrey, very much chagrined at the bad &s;uc|ce&s;s
of his endeavours, returned to his friend, and
made as favourable a report of the affair, as the
<PB N="17" REF="23">
nature of his conver&s;ation with Emilia would
permit; but as he could not avoid mentioning
her re&s;olution in the clo&s;e, Peregrine was obliged
to drink again the bitter draught of di&s;appoint|ment,
which put his pa&s;&s;ions into &s;uch a &s;tate of
agitation, as produced a &s;hort exta&s;y of de&s;pair,
in which he acted a thou&s;and extravagancies.
This paroxy&s;m, however, &s;oon &s;ub&s;ided into a
&s;ettled re&s;erve of gloomy re&s;entment, which he
in &s;ecret indulged, detaching him&s;elf as &s;oon as
po&s;&s;ible from the company of the &s;oldier, on pre|tence
of retiring to re&s;t.</P>
<P>While he lay ruminating upon the circum|&s;tances
of his pre&s;ent &s;ituation, his friend Pipes,
who knew the cau&s;e of his anxiety, and firmly
believed that Emilia loved his ma&s;ter in her heart,
how&s;oever &s;he might attempt to di&s;gui&s;e her &s;en|timents;
I &s;ay, Thomas w$s taken with a con|ceit
which he thought would &s;et every thing to
rights, and therefore put it in execution, without
farther delay. Laying a&s;ide his hat, he ran di|rectly
to the hou&s;e of Sophy's father, and affect|ing
an air of &s;urprize and con&s;ternation, to which
he had never before been &s;ubject, thundered at
the door with &s;uch an alarming knock, as in a
moment brought the whole family into the hall.
When he was admitted, he began to gape, &s;tare,
and pant at the &s;ame time, and made no reply,
when Godfrey a&s;ked what was the matter, till
Mrs. Gauntlet expre&s;&s;ed her apprehen&s;ions about
his ma&s;ter; at who&s;e name being mentioned, he
&s;eemed to make an effort to &s;peak, and in a bel|lowing
tone pronounced &startq;Brought him&s;elf up,
&s;plit my top-fails!&endq; So &s;aying, he pointed to his
own neck, and ro&s;e upon his tiptoes, by way of
explaining the meaning of his words.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="24">
Godfrey, without &s;taying to a&s;k another que|&s;tion,
ru&s;hed out, and flew towards the inn, with
the utmo&s;t horror and concern; while Sophy,
who did not rightly under&s;tand the language of
the me&s;&s;enger, addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to him a &s;econd
time, &s;aid with great earne&s;tne&s;s, &startq;I hope no
accident has happened to Mr. Pickle!&endq; &startq;No
accident at all, (replied Tom) he has only hanged
him&s;elf for love.&endq; The&s;e words had &s;carce pro|ceeded
from his mouth, when Emilia, who &s;tood
li&s;tening at the parlour-door, &s;hrieked aloud,
and dropped down &s;en&s;ele&s;s upon the floor; while
her &s;i&s;ter, who was almo&s;t equally &s;hocked at the
intelligence, had recour&s;e to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her
maid, by whom &s;he was &s;upported from falling.</P>
<P>Pipes hearing Emily's voice, congratulated
him&s;elf upon the &s;ucce&s;s of his &s;tratagem, he
&s;prung to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and lifting her up into an
ea&s;y chair, &s;tood by her, until he &s;aw her re|cover
from her &s;woon, and heard her call upon
his ma&s;ter's name, with all the frenzy of de&s;pair|ing
love. Then he bent his cour&s;e back to the
inn, overjoyed at the opportunity of telling Pe|regrine
what a confe&s;&s;ion he had extorted from
his mi&s;tre&s;s, and extremely vain of this proof of
his own fagacity.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Godfrey arriving at the
hou&s;e, in which he &s;uppo&s;ed this fatal cata&s;trophe
had happened, ran up &s;tairs to Peregrine's cham|ber,
without &s;taying to make any inquiry below;
and finding the door locked, bur&s;t it open with
one &s;troke of his foot. But, what was his amaze|ment,
when, upon entrance, our hero &s;tarting
up from the bed, &s;aluted him with a boi&s;terous
exclamation of &startq;Z&mdash;ds! who's there?&endq; He
was &s;truck dumb with a&s;toni&s;hment, which al&s;o
<PB N="19" REF="25">
rivetted him to the place where he &s;tood, &s;carce
crediting the te&s;timony of his own &s;en&s;es, 'till
Peregrine, with an air of di&s;content which de|noted
him di&s;plea&s;ed with his intru&s;ion, di&s;pelled
his apprehen&s;ion by a &s;econd addre&s;s, &s;aying, &startq;I
&s;ee you con&s;ider me as a friend, by your u&s;ing me
without ceremony.&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;oldier, thus convinced of the fal&s;ehood of
the information he had received, began to ima|gine,
that Pickle had projected the plan which
was executed by his &s;ervant; and looking upon it
as a piece of unju&s;tifiable &s;ine&s;&s;e, which might be
attended with very melancholy con&s;equences to
his &s;i&s;ter or wife, he an&s;wered in a &s;upercilious
tone, that he mu&s;t blame him&s;elf for the inter|ruption
of his repo&s;e, which was intirely owing
to the &s;orry je&s;t he had &s;et on foot.</P>
<P>Pickle, who was the child of pa&s;&s;ion, and
more than half mad with impatience before this
vi&s;it, hearing him&s;elf treated in &s;uch a cavalier
manner, advanced clo&s;e up to Godfrey's brea&s;t,
and a&s;&s;uming a &s;tern, or rather frantic counte|nance,
&startq;Heark ye, Sir, (&s;aid he) you are mi|&s;taken
if you think I je&s;t; I am in downright
earne&s;t I a&s;&s;ure you.&endq; Gauntlet, who was not a
man to be brow beaten, &s;eeing him&s;elf thus
bearded by a per&s;on of who&s;e conduct he had, he
thought, rea&s;on to complain, put on his military
look of defiance, and erecting his che&s;t, replied
with an exalted voice, &startq;Mr. Pickle, whether
you was in je&s;t or earne&s;t, you mu&s;t give me
leave to tell you, that the &s;cheme was childi&s;h,
un&s;ea&s;onable, and unkind, not to give it an
ha$&s;her term.&endq; &startq;Death, Sir, (cried our ad|venturer)
you trifle with my di&s;quiet: if there is
any meaning in your in&s;inuation, explain your|&s;elf,
<PB N="20" REF="26">
and then I &s;hall know what an&s;wer it will be|fit
me to give.&endq; &startq;I came with very different
&s;entiments, (re&s;umed the &s;oldier) but &s;ince you
urge me to expo&s;tulation, and behave with &s;uch
unprovoked lo&s;tine&s;s of di&s;plea&s;ure, I will, with|out
circumlocution, tax you with having com|mitted
an outrage upon the peace of my family,
in &s;ending your fellow to alarm us with &s;uch an
abrupt account of your having done violence upon
your&s;elf.&endq; Peregrine, confounded at this imputa|tion,
&s;tood &s;ilent, with a mo&s;t &s;avage a&s;pect of
&s;urprize, eager to know the circum&s;tance to
which his accu&s;er alluded, and incen&s;ed to find it
without the &s;phere of his comprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>While the&s;e two irritated friends &s;tood fronting
each other with mutual undignation in their eyes
and attitudes, they were joi$$d by Pipes, who
without taking the lea&s;t notice of the &s;ituation
in which he found them, told his ma&s;ter, that he
might up with the top-gallant-ma&s;ts of his heart,
and out with his rejoicing pendants; for as to mi|&s;tre&s;s
Emily, he had clapt her helm a-weather,
the ve&s;&s;el wore, and now &s;he was upon the other
tack, &s;tanding right into the harbour of his good
will.</P>
<P>Peregrine, who was not yet a connoi&s;&s;eur in
the terms of his lacquey, commanded him, upon
pain of his di&s;plea&s;ure, to be more explicit in his
intelligence; and by dint of divers que&s;tions, ob|tained
a perfect knowledge of the &s;cheme which
he had put in execution for his &s;ervice. This in|formation
perplexed him not a little; he would
have cha&s;ti&s;ed his &s;ervant upon the &s;pot, for his
temerity, had not he plainly perceived, that the
fellow's intention was to promote his ea&s;e and
&s;atisfaction: and on the other hand, he knew not
<PB N="21" REF="27">
how to acquit him&s;elf of the &s;u&s;picion which he
&s;aw Godfrey entertain of his being the projector
of the plan, without conde&s;cending to an explana|tion,
which his pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition could not brook.
After &s;ome pau&s;e, however, turning to Pipes, with a
&s;evere frown, &startq;Ra&s;cal! (&s;aid he) this is the &s;e|cond
time I have &s;uffered in the opinion of that lady
by yo$r ignorance and pre&s;umption; if ever you
inter$$$dle in my affairs for the future, without
expre&s;s order and direction, by all that's &s;acred!
I will put you to death without mercy. Away,
and let my hor&s;e be &s;addled this in&s;tant.&endq;</P>
<P>Pipes having withdrawn, in order to perform
this piece of duty, our young gentleman, ad|dre&s;&s;ing
him&s;elf again to the &s;oldier, and laying
his hand upon his brea&s;t, &s;aid with a &s;olemnity of
regard, &startq;Captain Gauntlet, upon my honour,
I am altogether innocent of that &s;hallow device
which you impute to my invention; and I don't
think you do ju&s;tice either to my intellects or ho|nour,
in &s;uppo&s;ing me capable of &s;uch in&s;olent
ab&s;urdity. As for your &s;i&s;ter, I have once in my
life affronted her in the madne&s;s and impetuo&s;ity
of de&s;ire; but I have made &s;uch acknowledge|ments,
and offered &s;uch atonement, as few wo|men
of her &s;phere would have refu&s;ed; and be|fore
God! I am determined to endure every tor|ment
of di&s;appointment and de&s;pair, rather than
pro&s;trate my&s;elf again to the cruelty of her un|ju&s;tifiable
pride.&endq; So &s;aying, he &s;talked &s;uddenly
down &s;tairs, and took hor&s;e immediately, his &s;pi|rits
being &s;upported by re&s;entment, which prompt|ed
him to vow within him&s;elf, that he would &s;eek
con&s;olation for the di&s;dain of Emilia, in the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the fir&s;t willing wench he &s;hould meet
upon the road.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="28">
While he &s;et out for the gari&s;on with the&s;e &s;en|timents,
Gauntlet, in a &s;u&s;pence between anger,
&s;hame and concern, returned to the hou&s;e of his
father-in-law, where he found his &s;i&s;ter &s;till vio|lently
agitated from the news of Peregrine's death,
the my&s;tery of which he forthwith unravelled,
recounting at the &s;ame time the particulars of the
conver&s;ation which had happened at the inn, and
de&s;cribing the demeanour of Pickle with &s;ome
expre&s;&s;ions of a&s;perity, which were neither agree|able
to Emilia, nor approved by the gentle So|phy,
who tenderly chid him, for allowing Pere|grine
to depart in terms of mi&s;under&s;tanding.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Peregrine &s;ets out for the gari&s;on, and meets with
a nymph of the read, whom be takes into keeping,
and metamorpho&s;es into a fine laay.</HEAD>
<P>IN the mean time, our hero jogged along in a
profound reverie, which was di&s;turbed by a
beggar-woman and her daughter, who &s;olicited him
for alms, as he pa&s;&s;ed them on the road. The girl
was about the age of &s;ixteen, and notwith&s;tanding
the wretched equipage in which &s;he appeared, ex|hibited
to his view a &s;et of agreeable features, en|livened
with the complexion of health and chear|fulne&s;s.
The re&s;olution I have already mentioned
was &s;till warm in his imagination; and he looked
upon this young mendicant as a very proper ob|ject
for the performance of his vow. He there|fore
entered into a conference with the mother,
and for a &s;mall &s;um of money purcha&s;ed her pro|perty
in the wench, who did not require much
court&s;hip and intreaty, before &s;he con&s;ented to
<PB N="23" REF="29">
accompany him to any place that he &s;hould ap|point
for her habitation.</P>
<P>This contract being &s;ettled to his &s;atisfaction,
he ordered Pipes to &s;eat his acqui&s;ition behind
him upon the crupper, and alighting at the fir&s;t
public hou&s;e which they found upon the road,
he wrote a letter to Hatchway, de&s;iring him to
receive this hedge-inamorata, and direct her to
be cleaned and cloathed in a decent manner,
with all expedition, &s;o that &s;he &s;hould be touch|able
upon his arrival, which (on that account)
he would defer for the &s;pace of one day. This
billet, together with the girl, he committed to
the charge of Pipes, after having laid &s;trong in|junctions
upon him to ab&s;tain from all attempts
upon her cha&s;tity, and ordered him to make the
be&s;t of his way to the gari&s;on, while he him&s;elf
cro&s;&s;ed the country to a market-town, where he
propo&s;ed to &s;pend the night.</P>
<P>Tom thus cautioned, proceeded with his
charge, and being naturally taciturn, opened not
his lips, until he had performed the be&s;t half of
his journey. But Thomas, notwith&s;tanding his
irony appearance, was in reality compo&s;ed of
fle&s;h and blood; and his de&s;ire being titillated by
the contact of a buxome wench, who&s;e right arm
embraced his middle as he rode, his thoughts be|gan
to mutiny again&s;t his ma&s;ter, and he found
it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to with&s;tand the temptation
of making love.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, he wre&s;tled with the&s;e rebellious
&s;ugge&s;tions with all the rea&s;on that God had en|abled
him to exert; and that being totally over|come,
his victorious pa&s;&s;ion &s;uddenly broke out
in this addre&s;s. &startq;'Sblood! a believe ma&s;ter

dear?&endq; To this que&s;tion his fellow-traveller re|plied,
&startq;Swanker! Anan!&endq; And the lover re|&s;umed
his &s;uit, &s;aying, &startq;Oons! how you tickle

&startq; Add$$ooks! ye baggage, (cried the lover) you
&s;houldn't want a &s;mock nor a petticoat neither,
if you could have a kindne&s;s for a true-hearted

jolly bitch you are!&endq; &startq;Bitch! (exclaimed this
modern Dulcinea, incen&s;ed at the opprobrious
term) &s;uch a bitch as your mother, you dog.
D&mdash;n ye, I've a good mind to box your jaws
in&s;tead of your comepi&s;s. I'll let you know
as how I am meat for your ma&s;ter, you &s;aucy
blackguard. You are wor&s;e than a dog, you old
flinty-faced, flea-bitten &s;crub: a dog wears his
own coat, but you wear your ma&s;ter's.&endq;</P>
<P>Such a torrent of di&s;graceful epithets from a
per&s;on who had no cloaths at all, converted the
gallant's love into choler, and he threatened to
di&s;mount and &s;eize her to a tree, when &s;he &s;hould
<PB N="25" REF="31">
have a ta&s;te of his cat and nine tails athwart her
quarters; but, in&s;tead of being intimidated by
his menaces, &s;he &s;et him at defiance, and held
forth with &s;uch a flow of eloquence, as would
have intitled her to a con&s;iderable &s;hare of reputa|tion,
even among the nymphs of Billing&s;gate;
for this young lady, over and above a natural ge|nius
for altercation, had her talents cultivated
among the venerable &s;ociety of weeders, podders,
and hoppers, with whom &s;he had a&s;&s;ociated from
her t$nder years. No wonder then, that &s;he
&s;oon obtained a compleat victory over Pipes,
who (as the reader may have ob&s;erved) was very
little addicted to the exerci&s;e of &s;peech: indeed
he was utterly di&s;concerted by her volubili$$ of
tongue; and being altogether unfurni&s;hed with
an&s;wers to the di&s;tinct periods of her di&s;cour&s;e,
very wi&s;ely cho&s;e to &s;ave him&s;elf the expence of
breath and argument, by giving her a full &s;wing
of cable, &s;o that &s;he might bring her&s;elf up;
while he rode onwards, in &s;ilent compo&s;ure,
without taking any farther notice of his fair fel|low-traveller
than if &s;he had been his ma&s;ter's
cloak-bag.</P>
<P>In &s;pite of all the di&s;patch he could make, it
was late before he arrived at the gari&s;on, where
he delivered the letter and the lady to the lieute|nant,
who no &s;ooner under&s;tood the intention of
his friend, than he ordered all the tubs in the
hou&s;e to be carried into the hall, and filled with
water; and Tom having provided him&s;elf with
&s;wabs and bru&s;hes, dive&s;ted the fair &s;tranger of
her variegated drapery, which was immediately
committed to the flames, and performed up$n her
&s;oft and &s;leek per&s;on the ceremony of &s;crubbing,
as it is practi&s;ed on board of the king's &s;hips of
<PB N="26" REF="32">
war. Yet the nymph her&s;elf did not &s;ubmit to
this purification without repining: &s;he curs'd the
director, who was upon the &s;pot, with many
abu&s;ive allu&s;ions to his wooden leg: and as for
Pipes the operator, &s;he employed her talons &s;o
effectually upon his face, that the blood ran over
his no&s;e in &s;undry &s;treams; and next morning,
when tho&s;e rivulets were dry, his countenance re|&s;embled
the rough bark of a plumb-tree, pla&s;ter|ed
with gum. Neverthele&s;s, he did his duty with
great per&s;everance, cut off her hair clo&s;e to the
&s;calp, handled his bru&s;hes with dexterity, ap|plied
his &s;wabs of different magnitude and texture,
as the ca&s;e required, and la&s;tly, rin&s;ed her whole
body with a dozen pails of cold water, di&s;charged
upon her head.</P>
<P>The&s;e ablutions being executed, he dried her
with towels, accommodated her with a clean
&s;hift, and acting the part of a valet de chambre,
cloathed her from head to foot, in clean and de|cent
apparel which had belonged to Mrs. Hatch|way;
by which means her appearance was al|tered
&s;o much for the better, that when Peregrine
arrived next day, he would &s;carce believe his own
eyes. He was, for that rea&s;on, extremely well
plea&s;ed with his purcha&s;e, and now re&s;olved to
indulge a whim which &s;eized him at the very in|&s;tant
of his arrival.</P>
<P>He had (as I believe the reader will readily al|low)
made con&s;iderable progre&s;s in the &s;tudy of
character, from the highe&s;t rank to the mo&s;t
humble &s;tation of life, and found it diver&s;ified in
the &s;ame manner, thro' every degree of &s;ubordi|nation
and precedency: nay, he moreover ob|&s;erved,
that the conver&s;ation of tho&s;e who are
dignin$d with the appellation of polite company,
<PB N="27" REF="33">
is neither more edifying nor entertaining than
that which is met with among the lower cla&s;&s;es
of mankind; and that the only e&s;&s;ential difference
in point of demeanor, is the form of an education,
which the meane&s;t capacity can acquire, without
much &s;tudy or application. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this no|tion,
he determined to take the young mendicant
under his own tutorage and in&s;truction. In con|&s;equence
of which he hoped he &s;hould, in a few
weeks, be able to produce her in company, as an
accompli&s;hed young lady of uncommon wit, and
an excellent under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>This extravagant plan he forthwith began to
execute with great eagerne&s;s and indu&s;try; and
his endeavours &s;ucceeded even beyond his ex|pectation.
The ob&s;tacle, in &s;urmounting of
which he found the greate&s;t difficulty, was an in|veterate
habit of &s;wearing, which had been in|dulged
from her infancy, and confirmed by the
example of tho&s;e among whom &s;he had lived.
However, &s;he had the rudiments of good &s;en&s;e
from nature, which taught her to li&s;ten to whol|&s;ome
advice, and was &s;o docile as to comprehend
and retain the le&s;&s;ons which her governor recom|mended
to her attention; in&s;omuch, that he ven|tured,
in a few days, to pre&s;ent her at table,
among a &s;et of country &s;quires, to whom &s;he was
introduced as a niece of the lieutenant. In that
capacity &s;he &s;at with becoming ea&s;ine&s;s of mien
(for &s;he was as void of the <HI>mauvai&s;e honte</HI> as any
dutche&s;s in the land) bowed very graciou&s;ly to
the compliments of the gentlemen; and tho' &s;he
&s;aid little or nothing, becau&s;e &s;he was previou&s;ly
cautioned on that &s;core, &s;he more than once gave
way to laughter, and her mirth happened to be
pretty well timed. In a word, &s;he attracted the
<PB N="28" REF="34">
applau&s;e and admiration of the gue&s;ts, who, after
&s;he was withdrawn, complimented Mr. Hatch|way
upon the beauty, breeding and good hu|mour
of his kin&s;woman.</P>
<P>But what contributed more than any other cir|cum&s;tance
to her &s;peedy improvement, was &s;ome
&s;mall in&s;ight into the primer, which &s;he had ac|quired
at a day-&s;chool, during the life of her fa|ther,
who was a day-labourer in the country.
Upon this foundation did Peregrine build a mo&s;t
elegant &s;uper&s;tructure; he $ulled out choice &s;en|tences
$rom Shake&s;pear, Otway, and Pope, and
taught her to repeat them with empha&s;is and
theatrical cadence: he then in&s;tructed her in the
names and epithets of the mo&s;t celebrated players,
which he directed her to pronounce occa&s;ionally,
with an air of carele&s;s familiarity; and perceiv|ing
that her voice was naturally clear, he en|riched
it with remnants of opera tunes, to be
hummed during a pau&s;e in conver&s;ation, which
is generally &s;upplied with the circulation of a
pinch of &s;nuff. By means of this cultivation, &s;he
became a wonderful proficient in the polite
graces of the age; &s;he, with great facility, com|prehended
the &s;cheme of whi&s;t, tho' cribbidge
was her favourite game, with which &s;he had
amu&s;ed her&s;elf in her vacant hours, from her fir&s;t
entrance into the profe&s;&s;ion of hopping; and brag
&s;oon g$$w familiar to her practice and concep|tion.</P>
<P>Thus prepared, &s;he was expo&s;ed to the com|pany
of her own &s;ex, being fir&s;t of all vi&s;ited by
the par&s;on's daughter, who could not avoid &s;hew|ing
that civility to Mr. Hatchway's niece, after
&s;he had made her public appearance at church.
Mrs. Clover, who had a great &s;hare of penetra|tion,
<PB N="29" REF="35">
could not help entertaining &s;ome doubts
about this &s;ame relation, who&s;e name &s;he had
never heard the&punc; uncle mention, during the whole
term of her re&s;idence at the gari&s;on; but as the
young lady was treated in that character, &s;he
would not refu&s;e her acquaintance, and after
having &s;een her at the ca&s;tle, actually invited
Mi&s;s Hatchway to her hou&s;e. In &s;hort, &s;he made
a progre&s;s thro' almo&s;t all the families in the
neighbourhood; and, by dint of her quotations,
(which, by the bye, were not always judiciou&s;ly
u&s;ed) &s;he pa&s;&s;ed for a &s;prightly young lady, of
uncommon learning and ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Peregrine having, in this manner, initiated her
in the beau monde of the country, conducted her
to London, where &s;he was provided with private
lodgings and a female attendant; and put her
immediately under the tuition of his v$let de
chambre, who had orders to in&s;truct her in danc|ing
and the French language. He attended her
to plays and concerts, three or four times a
week; and when our hero thought her &s;ufficient|ly
accu&s;tomed to the &s;ight of great company, he
&s;quired her in per&s;on to a public a&s;&s;embly, and
danced with her among all the gay ladies of
fa&s;hion: not but that there was &s;till an evident
air of $u&s;ticity and aukwardne&s;s in her demea|n$$,
which was interpreted into an agreeable
w$$dne&s;s of &s;pirit, &s;uperior to the forms of com|mon
breeding. He afterwards found means to
make her acquainted with &s;ome di&s;tingui&s;hed
patterns of her own &s;ex, by whom &s;he was ad|mitted
into their mo&s;t elegant parties, and conti|nued
to make good her preten&s;ions to gentility,
with great circum&s;pection, till one evening, being
at cards with a certain lady, whom &s;he detected
<PB N="30" REF="36">
in the very fact of unfair conveyance, &s;he taxed
her roundly with the fraud, and brought upon
her&s;elf &s;uch a torrent of &s;arca&s;tic reproof, as over-bore
all her maxims of caution, and bur&s;t open
the floodgates of her own natural repartee,
twanged off with the appellations of b&mdash;and
w&mdash;, which &s;he repeated with great vehe|mence,
in an attitude of manual defiance, to the
terror of her antagoni&s;t, and the a&s;toni&s;hment of
all pre&s;ent: nay, to &s;uch an unguarded pitch
was &s;he provoked, that &s;tarting up, &s;he &s;napt
her fingers, in te&s;timony of di&s;dain, and, as &s;he
quitted the room, applied her hand to that part
which was the la&s;t of her that di&s;appeared, invit|ing
the company to ki&s;s it, by one of its coar&s;e&s;t
denominations.</P>
<P>Peregrine was a little di&s;concerted at this over-&s;ight
in her behaviour, which, by the daemon of
intelligence, was in a moment conveyed to all
the private companies in town; &s;o that &s;he was
ab&s;olutely excluded from all polite communica|tion,
and Peregrine, for the pre&s;ent, di&s;graced
among the mode&s;t part of his female acquaint|ance,
many of whom not only forbad him their
hou&s;es, on account of the impudent in&s;ult he had
committed upon their honour as well as under|&s;tanding,
in palming a common trull upon them,
as a young lady of birth and education, but al&s;o
a&s;per&s;ed his family, by affirming that &s;he was ac|tually
his own cou&s;in-german, whom he had
precipitately rai&s;ed from the mo&s;t abject &s;tate of
humility and contempt. In revenge for this ca|lumny,
our young gentleman explained the
whole my&s;tery of her promotion, together with
the motives that induced him to bring her into the
fa&s;hionable world; and repeated among his com|panions,
<PB N="31" REF="37">
the extravagant encomiums which had
been be&s;towed upon her by the mo&s;t di&s;cerning
matrons of the age.</P>
<P>Mean while, the in&s;anta her&s;elf being rebuked
by her benefactor, for this in&s;tance of misbeha|viour,
promi&s;ed faithfully to keep a &s;tricter guard
for the future over her conduct, and applied her|&s;elf
with great a&s;&s;iduity to the &s;tudies, in which
&s;he was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Swi&s;s, who gradually lo&s;t
the freedom of his heart, while &s;he was profiting
by his in&s;truction. In other words, &s;he made a
conque&s;t of her preceptor, who yielding to the
in&s;tigations of the fle&s;h, cho&s;e a proper opportu|nity
to declare his pa&s;&s;ion, which was powerfully
recommended by his per&s;onal qualifications; and
his intentions being honourable, &s;he li&s;tened to
his propo&s;als of e&s;pou&s;ing her in private. In
con&s;equence of this agreement, they made an
elopement together; and being buckled at the
fleet, con&s;ummated their nuptials in private lodg|ings,
by the Seven Dials, from which the hus|band
next morning &s;ent a letter to our hero, beg|ging
forgivene&s;s for the clande&s;tine &s;tep he had
taken, which he &s;olemnly prote&s;ted was not ow|ing
to any abatement in his inviolable regard for
his ma&s;ter, whom he &s;hould always honour and
e&s;teem to his late&s;t breath, but intirely to the ir|re&s;i&s;tible
charms of the young lady, to whom he
was now &s;o happy as to be joined in the &s;ilken
bonds of marriage.</P>
<P>Peregrine, tho' at fir&s;t offended at his valet's
pre&s;umption, was, upon &s;econd thoughts, recon|ciled
to the event by which he was delivered
from an incumbrance; for by this time he had
performed his frolick, and begun to be tired of
his acqui&s;ition. He reflected on the former fide|lity
<PB N="32" REF="38">
of the Swi&s;s, which had been manife&s;ted in a
long cour&s;e of &s;ervice and attachment; and think|ing
it would be cruelly &s;evere to abandon him to
poverty and di&s;tre&s;s for one venial tre&s;pa&s;s, he
re&s;olved to pardon what he had done, and enable
him in &s;ome &s;hape to provide for the family
which he had intailed upon him&s;elf.</P>
<P>With the&s;e &s;entiments, he &s;ent a favourable
an&s;wer to the delinquent, de&s;iring to &s;ee him as
&s;oon as his pa&s;&s;ion would permit him to leave the
arms of his &s;pou&s;e, for an hour or two; and
Hadgi, in obedience to this intimation, repaired
immediately to the lodgings of his ma&s;ter, before
whom he appeared with a mo&s;t penitential a&s;pect.
Peregrine, tho' he could &s;carce help laughing at
his rueful length of face, reprimanded him &s;harp|ly
for his di&s;re&s;pect and ingratitude, in taking that
by &s;tealth which he might have had for a&s;king;
and the culprit a&s;&s;ured him, that next to the ven|geance
of God, his di&s;plea&s;ure was that which,
of all evils, he dreaded to incu$; but that love
had di&s;tracted his train in &s;uch a manner, as to
bani&s;h every other con&s;ideration but that of grati|fying
his de&s;ire; and $e owned, that $e &s;$ould
not have been able to pre&s;erve his fidelity and
duty to his own father, had they interfered with
the intere&s;t of his pa&s;&s;ion. He th$n appealed to
his ma&s;ter's own heart for the remi&s;&s;ion of his
guilt, alluding to certain circum&s;tances of our
hero's conduct, which evinced the de&s;perate ef|fects
of love. In &s;hort, he m$d$ &s;uch an $$$logy
as extorted a &s;mile from his $word$ judge, who
not only forgave his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, but al&s;o pro|mi&s;ed
to put him in &s;ome $word$ way of earning a
comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="39">
The Swi&s;s was &s;o much affected with this in|&s;tance
of genero&s;ity, that he fell upon his knees,
and ki&s;&s;ed his hand, praying to heaven, with
great f$$vour, to make him worthy of &s;uch good|ne&s;s
and cond$&s;c$n&s;ion. His &s;cheme, he &s;aid, was
to open a c$ff$ehou&s;e and tavern in &s;ome credit|able
part of the town, in hopes of being favour|ed
with the cu&s;tom of a numerous acquaintance
he had made among upper &s;ervants and reputable
trade&s;men, not doubting that his wife would be
an ornament to his bar, and a careful manager of
$word$ affairs. Peregrine approved of the plan, to|wards
the execution of which he made him and
his wife a pre&s;ent of five hundred pounds, toge|ther
with a promi&s;e of erecting a weekly club
among his friends, for the reputation and advan|tage

pudding-bags about his ankles; his &s;hirt, tho'
new-wa&s;h'd, was of the &s;affron hue, and in di|vers
places appeared through the crannies of his
breeches; he had exchanged his own hair for a
&s;moke-dry'd tye-periwig, which all the flour in
his drudging-box had not been able to whiten;
his eyes were &s;unk, his jaws lengthened beyond
their u&s;ual exten&s;ion; and he &s;eemed twenty
years older than he looked when he and our hero
parted at Rotterdam.</P>
<P>In &s;pite of all the&s;e evidences of decay, he ac|co&s;ted
him with a meagre affectation of content
and good humour, &s;truggled piteou&s;ly to appear
gay and unconcerned, profe&s;&s;ed his joy at &s;eeing
him in England, excu&s;ed him&s;elf for having de|layed
&s;o long to come and pre&s;ent his re&s;pects;
alledging, that &s;ince his return he had been a
meer &s;lave to the &s;atisfaction of &s;ome per&s;ons of
quality and ta&s;te, who had in&s;i&s;ted upon his
fini&s;hing &s;ome pieces with the utmo&s;t expedi|tion.</P>
<P>Peregrine received him with that compa&s;&s;ion
and complai&s;ance which was natural to his di&s;|po&s;ition,
inquired about the healths of Mrs. Pal|let
<PB N="35" REF="41">
and his family, and a&s;ked if his friend the
doctor was in town. The painter &s;eemed to have
re&s;umed his re&s;entment again&s;t that gentleman,
of whom he &s;poke in contemptuous terms. &startq;The
doctor (&s;aid he) is &s;o much over&s;hadowed with
pre&s;umption and &s;elf-conceit, that his merit has
no relief. It does not ri&s;e. There is no keeping
in the picture, my dear Sir. All the &s;ame as if I
were to repre&s;ent the moon under a cloud;
there would be nothing but a deep ma&s;s of
&s;hade, with a little tiny &s;peck of light in the
middle, which would only &s;erve to make, as it
were, the darkne&s;s vi&s;ible. You under&s;tand me.
Had he taken my advice, it might have been
better for him; but he's bigotted to his own
opinion. You mu&s;t know, Mr. Pickle, upon
our return to England, I coun&s;elled him to com|po&s;e
a little, &s;mart, clever ode upon my Cleo|patra.
As Gad &s;hall judge me, I thought it
would have been of &s;ome &s;ervice, in helping him
out of ob&s;curity; for you know, as Sir Richard
ob&s;erves,
<Q><L>Soon will that die, which adds thy fame to mine.</L>
<L>Let me then live, join'd to a work of thine.</L></Q>
By the bye, there is a mo&s;t picture&s;que con|tra&s;t
in the&s;e lines, of <HI>thy</HI> and <HI>me, living</HI> and <HI>dy|ing,</HI>
and <HI>thine</HI> and <HI>mine.</HI> Ah! a pize upon it!
Dick, after all, was the man. Ecod! he
rounded it off. But, to return to this unhappy
young man, would you believe it, he to&s;&s;ed up
his no&s;e at my friendly propo&s;al, and gabbled
&s;omething in Greek, which i$ not worth re|peating.
The ca&s;e was this, my dear Sir, he
was out of humour at the neglect of the world.
<PB N="36" REF="42">
He thought the poets of the age were jealous of
his genius, and &s;trove to cru&s;h it accordingly,
while the re&s;t of mankind wanted ta$$e &s;ufficient
to di&s;cern it. For my own part, I profe&s;s my|&s;elf
one of the&s;e; and as the clown in Billy
Shake&s;pear &s;ays of the cou$$$$$ oath, had I
$worn by the doctor's genius, that the pan$akes
were naught, they might have been for all that
very good, yet &s;houldn't I have been for&s;worn.
Let that be as it will, he retired from town in
great dudgeon, and &s;et up his re&s;t near a hill in
D$rby&s;hire, with two tops, re&s;embling Parna&s;&s;us,
and a well at the bottom, which he had chri&s;tened
Hyp-o-the-Green. Egad! if he &s;tays in that h$|bitation,
'tis my opinion he'd &s;oon grow green
with the hip indeed. He'll be glad of an oppor|tunity
to return to the fle&s;h-pots of Egypt, and
pay his court to the &s;lighted queen Cleopatra.
Ha! well remembered, by this light. You &s;hall
know, my good Sir, that this &s;ame Egyptian
prince&s;s has been courted by &s;o many gallants of
ta&s;te, that as I hope to live, I found my&s;elf in
&s;ome &s;ort of a dilemma, becau&s;e in parting with
her to one, I &s;hould have di&s;obliged all his rivals.
Now a man would not chu&s;e to give offence to
his friends, at lea&s;t I lay it down as a maxim, to
avoid the &s;malle&s;t appearance of ingratitude.
Perhaps I may be in the wrong. But every man
has his way. For this rea&s;on, I propo&s;ed to all
the candidates, that a lottery or raffle &s;hould be
&s;et on foot, by which every individual would
have an equal chance for her good graces, and
the prize to be left to the deci&s;ion of fortune.
The &s;cheme was mightily reli&s;hed, and the terms
being &s;uch a trifle as half a guinea, the whole
town crouded into my hou&s;e, in order to &s;ub|&s;cribe.
<PB N="37" REF="43">
But there I was their humble &s;ervant.
Gentlemen, you mu&s;t have a little patience till
my own particular friends are &s;erved. Among
that number, I do my&s;elf the honour to con&s;ider
Mr. Pickle. Here is a copy of the propo&s;als;
and if the li&s;t &s;hould be adorned with his name,
I hope, notwith&s;tanding his merited &s;ucce&s;s
among the young ladies, he will for once be
&s;hunned by that little vixen called Mi&s;s Fortune;
he, he, he!&endq;</P>
<P>So &s;aying, he bowed with a thou&s;and api&s;h
conges, and pre&s;ented his paper to Peregrine,
who &s;eeing the number of &s;ub&s;cribers was li|mited
to one hundred, &s;aid he thought him too
moderate in his expectations, as he did not doubt
that his picture would be a cheap purcha&s;e at five
hundred, in&s;tead of fifty pounds, at which the
price was fixed. To this unexpected remark
Pallet an&s;wered, that among connoi&s;&s;eurs he
would not pretend to apprai&s;e his picture; but
that, in valuing his works, he was obliged to
have an eye to the Gothic ignorance of the age
in which he lived.</P>
<P>Our adventurer &s;aw at once into the nature of
this raff$$, which was no other than a begging
&s;hift to di&s;po&s;e of a paultry piece, that he could
not otherwi&s;e have &s;old for twenty &s;hillings.
However, far from &s;hocking the poor man in
di&s;tre&s;s, by dropping the lea&s;t hint of his con|jecture,
he de&s;ired to be favoured with &s;ix
chances, if the circum&s;tances of his plan would
indulge him &s;o far; and the painter, after &s;ome
he&s;itation, conde&s;cended to comply with his re|que&s;t,
out of pure friend&s;hip and veneration;
tho' he ob&s;erved, that in &s;o doing he mu&s;t ex|clude
&s;ome of his mo&s;t intimate companions.
<PB N="38" REF="44">
Having received the money, he gave Pickle his
addre&s;s, de&s;iring he would, with his convenience,
vi&s;it the prince&s;s, who, he was &s;ure, would di&s;|play
her mo&s;t engaging attractions, in order to
captivate his fancy; and took his leave, extreme|ly
well plea&s;ed with the &s;ucce&s;s of his applica|tion.</P>
<P>Tho' Peregrine was tempted with the curio&s;ity
of &s;eeing this portrait, which he imagined mu&s;t
contain &s;ome analogy to the ridiculous oddity of
the painter, he would not expo&s;e him&s;elf to the
di&s;agreeable alternative of applauding the per|formance,
contrary to the dictates of con&s;cience
and common &s;en&s;e, or of condemning it, to the
un&s;peakable mortification of the mi&s;erable au|thor;
and therefore never dreamt of returning
the painter's vi&s;it: nor did he ever hear of the
lottery's being drawn.</P>
<P>About this time he was invited to &s;pend a few
weeks at the country-&s;eat of a certain nobleman,
with whom he had contracted an acquaintance,
in the cour&s;e of his debauches, which we have
already de&s;cribed; and his lord&s;hip being remark|able
for his &s;kill and &s;ucce&s;s in hor&s;e-racing, his
hou&s;e was continually filled with the connoi&s;&s;eurs
and admirers of that &s;port, upon which the
whole conver&s;ation turned, in&s;omuch that Pere|grine
gradually imbibed &s;ome knowledge in
hor&s;e-fle&s;h, and the diver&s;ions of the cour&s;e; for
the whole occupation of the day, exclu&s;ive of
eating and drinking, con&s;i&s;ted in viewing, ma|naging
and exerci&s;ing his lord&s;hip's &s;tud.</P>
<P>Our hero looked upon the&s;e amu&s;ements with
an eye of t$&s;te, as well as curio&s;ity; he contem|plated
the animal as a beautiful and elegant part
of the creation, and reli&s;hed the &s;urpri&s;ing exer|tion
<PB N="39" REF="45">
of its &s;peed with a refined and cla&s;&s;ical de|light.
In a little time he became per&s;onally ac|quainted
with every hor&s;e in the &s;table, and in|tere&s;ted
him&s;elf in the reputation of each; while
he al&s;o gratified his appetite for knowledge, in
ob&s;erving the methods of preparing their bodies,
and training them to the race. His landlord &s;aw
and encouraged his eagerne&s;s, from which he
promi&s;ed him&s;elf &s;ome advantage; he formed &s;e|veral
private matches for his entertainment, and
flattered his di&s;cernment, by permitting him to
be &s;ucce&s;sful in the fir&s;t betts he made. Thus
was he artfully decoyed into a &s;pirit of keenne&s;s
and adventure, and di&s;po&s;ed to depend upon his
own judgment, in oppo&s;ition to that of people
who had made cour&s;ing the &s;ole &s;tudy of their
lives. He accompanied my lord to Newmarket,
and entering at once into the genius of the place,
was marked as fair game, by all the knowing
ones there a&s;&s;embled, many of whom found
means to <HI>take him in,</HI> in &s;pite of all the cautions
and admonitions of his lord&s;hip, who wanted to
re&s;erve him for his own u&s;e.</P>
<P>It is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for any man, let him
be never &s;o fearful or phlegmatic, to be an un|concerned
&s;pectator in this bu&s;y &s;cene. The
daemon of play hovers in the air, like a pe&s;ti|lential
vapour, tainting the minds of all pre&s;ent
with infallible infection, which communicates
from one per&s;on to another, like the circulation
of a general pannic. Peregrine was &s;eized with
this epidemic di&s;temper to a violent degree; and
after having lo&s;t a few loo&s;e hundreds, in his
progre&s;s through the various rookeries of the
place, entered into partner&s;hip with his noble
friend in a grand match, upon the i&s;&s;ue of which
<PB N="40" REF="46">
he ventured no le&s;s than three thou&s;and pounds.
Indeed, he would not have ri&s;qued &s;uch a con|&s;iderable
&s;um, had not his own confidence been
reinforced by the opinion and concurrence of his
lord&s;hip, who hazarded an equal bett upon the
&s;ame event. The&s;e two a&s;&s;ociates engaged them|&s;elves
in the penalty of &s;ix thou&s;and pounds, to
run one chai&s;e and four again&s;t another, three
times round the cour&s;e; and our adventurer had
the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing his antagoni&s;ts di&s;tanced
in the fir&s;t and &s;econd heat; but all of a &s;udden,
one of the hor&s;es of his machine was knocked
up, by which accident, the victory was ravi&s;hed
almo&s;t from his very gra&s;p, and he was obliged
to endure the damage and the &s;corn.</P>
<P>He was deeply affected with this misfortune,
which he imputed to his own extravagance and
temerity, but di&s;covered no external &s;igns of af|fliction,
becau&s;e his illu&s;trious partner bore his
lo&s;s with the mo&s;t philo&s;ophic re&s;ignation, con|&s;oling
him&s;elf, as well as Pickle, with the hope
of making it up, on &s;ome other occa&s;ion. Ne|verthele&s;s,
our young gentleman could not help
admiring and even envying his equanimity, not
knowing that his lord&s;hip had managed matters
&s;o as to be a gainer by the misfortune; which to
retrieve, Peregrine purcha&s;ed &s;everal hor&s;es, at
the recommendation of his friend; and in&s;tead
of returning to London, made a tour with him
to all the celebrated races in England, at which,
after &s;everal vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune, he made
&s;hift, before the end of the &s;ea&s;on, to treble
his lo&s;s.</P>
<P>But his hopes &s;eemed to increa&s;e with his ill
luck; and in the beginning of winter he came
to town, fully per&s;uaded that fortune mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily
<PB N="41" REF="47">
change, and that next &s;ea&s;on he &s;hould
reap the happy fruits of his experience. In this
confidence, he &s;eemed to drown all ideas of pru|dence
and oeconomy; his former expence was
mere par&s;imony, compared with that which he
now incurred: he &s;ub&s;cribed to the opera, and
half a dozen concerts at different parts of the
town; was a benefactor to &s;everal ho&s;pitals, pur|cha&s;ed
a collection of valuable pictures, took an
hou&s;e, and furni&s;hed it in a mo&s;t magnificent
ta&s;te, laid in a large &s;tock of French wines, and
gave extravagant entertainments to his quality-friends,
who in return loaded him with compli|ment,
and in&s;i&s;ted upon his making u&s;e of their
intere&s;t and good-will.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XCVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">He is taken into the protection of a great man;

<P>AMONG the&s;e profe&s;&s;ed patrons, the
greate&s;t part of whom Peregrine &s;aw thro',
there was one great per&s;onage, who &s;eemed to
&s;upport with dignity the &s;phere in which fortune
had placed him. His behaviour to Pickle was
not a &s;eries of grinning compl$i&s;ance, in a flat
repetition of general expre&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip and
regard. He demeaned him&s;elf with a &s;eemingly
hone&s;t re&s;erve, in point of profe&s;&s;ion; his ad|vances
to Peregrine appeared to be the re&s;ult of
deliberation and experiment; he chid the young
gentleman for his extravagance with the autho|rity
of a parent, and the &s;incerity of a fa&s;t
<PB N="42" REF="48">
friend; and having, by gradual inquiries, made
him&s;elf acquainted with the &s;tate of his private
affairs, condemned his conduct with an air of
c$ndour and concern. He repre&s;ented to him
the folly and dangerous con&s;equences of the pro|&s;tigate
life in which he had plunged him&s;elf,
coun&s;$ll$d him with great warmth to &s;ell off his
race-hor&s;es, which would otherwi&s;e in&s;en&s;ibly cat
him up; to ret$ench all &s;uperfluous expence,
which would only &s;erve to expo&s;e him to the ri|dicule
and ingratitude of tho&s;e who were bene|fited
by it; to lay out his money upon &s;ecure
mortgages, at good intere&s;t; and carry into exe|cution
his former de&s;ign of &s;tanding candidate
for a borough, at the en&s;uing election for a new
parliament; in which c$&s;$, this nobleman pro|mi&s;ed
to a&s;&s;i&s;t him with his influence and advice;
a&s;&s;uring him, that if he could once procure a &s;eat
in the hou&s;e, he might look upon his fortune as
already made.</P>
<P>Our adventurer perceived the wi&s;dom and &s;a|nity
of this advice, for which he made his ac|knowledgments
to his generous monitor, pro|te&s;ting
that he would adhere to it in every parti|cular,
and immediately &s;et about a reformation.
He accordingly took cognizance of his mo&s;t mi|nute
affairs, and after an exact &s;crutiny, gave
his patron to under&s;tand, that, exclu&s;ive of his
furniture, his fortune was reduced to fourteen
thou&s;and three hundred and thirty pounds, in
Bank and South-Sea annuities, over and above
the gari&s;on and its appendages, which he reckoned
at &s;ixty pounds a year. He therefore de&s;ired
that as his lord&s;hip had been &s;o kind as to favour
him with his friend&s;hip and advice, he would ex|tend
his genero&s;ity &s;till $word$, $y putting him in
<PB N="43" REF="49">
a way of making the mo&s;t advantage of his mo|ney
My lord &s;aid, that for his own part he did not
chu&s;e to meddle in moneymatters; that he
would find abundance of people ready to borrow it
upon land-&s;ecurity; but that he ought to be ex|tremely
cautious in a tran&s;action of &s;uch con&s;e|quence;
promi&s;ing at the &s;ame time, to employ
his own &s;teward, in &s;eeking out a mortgager to
whom it might be &s;afely lent.</P>
<P>This agent was accordingly &s;et at work, and
for a few days made a fruitle&s;s inquiry; &s;o that
the young gentleman was obliged to have re|cour&s;e
to his own intelligence, by which he got
notice of &s;everal people of reputed credit, who
offered him mortgages for the whole &s;um; but
when he made a report of the particulars to his
noble friend, his lord&s;hip &s;tarted &s;uch doubts and
objections relating to each, that he was deterred
from entering into any engagements with the pro|po&s;ers;
congratulating him&s;elf, in the mean time,
on his good fortune, in being favoured with the
advice and direction of &s;uch a &s;age coun&s;ellor.
Neverthele&s;s, he began to be impatient, after
having un&s;ucce&s;sfully con&s;ulted all the money-brokers
and conve$ancers about town, and re|&s;olved
to try the expedient of a public adverti&s;e|ment.
But he was per&s;uaded by my lord to
po&s;tpone that experiment, until every other me|thod
&s;hould have failed, becau&s;e it would attract
the attention of all the petti&s;oggers in London,
who (though they might not be able to overreach)
would infallibly harra&s;s and teize him out
of all tranquillity.</P>
<P>It was on the back of this conver&s;ation that
Peregrine, chancing to meet the &s;teward near his
l$rd's hou&s;e, &s;topped him in the &s;treet, to give
<PB N="44" REF="50">
him an account of his bad luck; at which the
other expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome concern, and rubbing his
chin with his hand, in a mu&s;ing po&s;ture, told
Pickle, there was a thought ju&s;t come into his
head, pointing out one way of doing his bu&s;ine&s;s
effectually. The youth, upon this intimation,
begg'd he would accompany him to the next cof|fee-hou&s;e,
in which having cho&s;en a private &s;itua|tion,
this grave manager gave him to under&s;tand,
that a part of my lord's e&s;tate was mortgaged, in
con&s;equence of a debt contracted by his grand|father,
for provi&s;ion to the younger children of
the family; and that the equity of redemption
would be foreclo&s;ed in a few months, unle&s;s the
burthen could be di&s;charged. &startq;My lord (&s;aid
he) has always lived in a &s;plendid manner, and
notwith&s;tanding his ample fortune, together with
the profits accruing from the po&s;ts he enjoys, he
&s;aves &s;o little money, that, upon this occa&s;ion, I
know he will be obliged to borrow ten thou&s;and
pounds, to make up the &s;um that is requi&s;ite to
redeem the mortgage. Now, certain I am, that
when his de&s;ign comes to be known, he will be
&s;ollicited on all hands, by people de&s;irous of lend|ing
money upon &s;uch undoubted &s;ecurity; and
'tis odds but he has already promi&s;ed the pre|ference
to &s;ome particular acquaintance. How|ever,
as I know he has your intere&s;t very much
at heart, I will (if you plea&s;e) found his lord|&s;hip
upon the &s;ubject, and in a day or two give you
notice of my &s;ucce&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P>Peregrine, ravi&s;hed with the pro&s;pect of &s;ettling
this affair &s;o much to his &s;atisfaction, thanked
the &s;teward for his friendly hint and undertaking,
which he a&s;&s;ured him &s;hould be acknowledged by
a more &s;olid proof of his gratitude, provided the
<PB N="45" REF="51">
bu&s;ine&s;s could be brought to bear; and next day,
he was vi&s;ited by this kind manager, with the
happy news of his lord&s;hip's having con&s;ented to
borrow ten thou&s;and pounds of his &s;tock, upon
mortgage, at the intere&s;t of five <HI>per Cent.</HI> This
information he received as an in&s;tance of the &s;in|gular
e&s;teem of his noble patron; and the papers
being immediately drawn and executed, the mo|ney
was depo&s;ited in the hands of the mortgager,
who, in the hearing of the lender, laid &s;trong
injunctions on his &s;teward to pay the intere&s;t
punctually at quarter-day.</P>
<P>The be&s;t part of our hero's fortune being thus
happily depo&s;ited, and the agent gratified with a
pre&s;ent of fifty pieces, he began to put his re|trenching
&s;cheme in execution; all his &s;ervan$s
($$ipes excepted) were di&s;charged, his chariot and
running-hor&s;es di&s;po&s;ed of, his hou&s;e-keeping
broke up, and his furniture &s;old by auction: nay,
the heat of his di&s;po&s;ition was as remarkable in
this, as in any other tran&s;action of his life; for
every &s;tep of his &s;aving project was taken with
&s;uch eagerne&s;s, and even precipitation, that mo&s;t
of his companions thought he was either ruined
or mad. But he an&s;wered all their expo&s;tulations
with a &s;tring of prudent apophthegms, &s;uch as,
&startq;The &s;horte&s;t follies are the be&s;t;&endq; &startq;Better
to retrench upon conviction than compul&s;ion;&endq;
and divers other wi&s;e maxims, &s;eemingly the re|&s;ult
of experience and philo&s;ophic reflection. To
&s;uch a degree of enthu&s;ia&s;m did his pre&s;ent oeco|nomy
prevail, that he was actually &s;eized with
the de&s;ire of ama&s;&s;ing; and as he every day re|ceived
propo&s;als, from tho&s;e brokers whom he
had employed, about the di&s;po&s;al of his ca&s;h, he
<PB N="46" REF="52">
at length ventured fifteen hundred pounds upon
bottomry, being tempted by the exce&s;&s;ive pre|mium.</P>
<P>But it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, for the honour of our
adventurer, that this reformation did not at all in|terfere
with the good qualities of his heart: he
was &s;till as friendly and benevolent as ever, tho'
his liberality was more &s;ubjected to the re&s;traint
of rea&s;on; and he might have ju&s;tly pleaded, in
vindication of his genero&s;ity, that he retrenched
the &s;uperfluiti$s in his own way of living, in or|der
to pre&s;erve the power of a&s;&s;i&s;ting his fellow-creatures
in di&s;tre&s;s. Numberle&s;s were the ob|jects
to which he extended his charity in privat$$&punc;
Indeed, he exerted this virtue in &s;ecret, not only
$n account of avoiding the charge of o&s;tenta|tion,
but al&s;o becau&s;e he was a&s;hamed of being
detected in &s;uch an awkward un&s;a$hionable prac|tice,
by the cen&s;orious ob&s;ervers of this humane
generation. In this particular, he &s;eemed to
confound the ideas of virtue and vice; for he did
good as other people do evil, that is, by &s;tealth;
and was &s;o capricious in point of behaviour, that
frequently, in public, he wagged his tongue in
&s;$tirical animadver&s;ions upon that poverty, which
his hand had, in private, relieved. Yet, far
from &s;hunning the acquaintance, or di&s;couraging
the &s;olicitation of tho&s;e who, he thought, wanted
his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he was always acce&s;&s;ible, open, and
complacent to them, even when the haughtine&s;s
of his temper kept his &s;uperiors at a di&s;tance;
and often &s;aved a mode&s;t man the angui&s;h and
confu&s;ion of declaring him&s;elf, by penetrating in|to
his nece&s;&s;ity, and anticipating his reque&s;t, in a
frank offer of his pur&s;e and friend&s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="53">
Not that he practi&s;ed this beneficence to all the
needy of his acquaintance, without di&s;tinction;
there is always a &s;et of idle profligate fellows,
who having &s;quandered away their own fortunes,
and conquered all &s;en&s;e of honour and &s;hame,
maintain them&s;elves by borrowing from tho&s;e
who have not yet fini&s;hed the &s;ame career, and
want re&s;olution to re&s;i&s;t their importunate de|mands.
To the&s;e he was always inflexible;
though he could not ab&s;olutely detach him&s;elf from
their company, becau&s;e, by dint of effrontery,
and &s;uch of their original connexions as they have
been able to retain, they find admi&s;&s;ion to all
places of fa&s;hionable re&s;ort.</P>
<P>Several in&s;ucce&s;sful attacks had been made up|on
his pocket, by beggars of this cla&s;s, one of
the mo&s;t artful of whom, having one day joined
him in the Mall, and made the u&s;ual ob&s;ervation
on the weather, damned the fogs of London,
and began a di&s;&s;ertation on the difference of a$,
preferring that of the county in which he was
born, to any climate under the &s;un. &startq;Was you
ever in Glouce&s;ter&s;hire?&endq; (&s;aid he to Peregrin$)
who replying in the negative, he thus went on:
&startq;I have got a hou&s;e there, where I &s;hould be
glad to &s;ee you. Let us go down together, dur|ing
the Ea&s;ter-holidays; I can promi&s;e you good
country-fare and whole&s;ome exerci&s;e; for I have
every thing within my&s;elf, and as good a pack of
fox-hounds as any in the three kingdoms. I
&s;han't pretend to expatiate upon the elegance of
the hou&s;e, which to be &s;ure is an old building;
and the&s;e, you know, are generally cold, and
not very convenient. But, cur&s;e the hou&s;e! the
dirty acres about it are the thing; and a damn'd
fine parcel they are, to be &s;ure. If my old
<PB N="48" REF="54">
grandmother was dead&mdash;&s;he can't live another
&s;ea&s;on, for &s;he's turned of four&s;core, and quite
wore out: nay, as for that matter, I believe I
have got a letter in my pocket, giving an account
of her being de&s;paired of by the doctors. Let me
&s;ee&mdash;No, d&mdash;n it, I left it at home, in the pocket
of another coat.&endq;</P>
<P>Pickle, who from the beginning of this ha|rangue,
&s;aw its tendency, &s;eemed to yield the
mo&s;t &s;erious attention to what he &s;aid; breaking
in upon it, every now and then, with the inter|jections,
Hum! Ha! The deuce! and &s;everal
civil que&s;tions, from which the other con|ceived
happy omens of &s;ucce&s;s; till perceiving
they had advanced as far as the pa&s;&s;age into St.
James's, the mi&s;chievous youth interrupted him
all at once, &s;aying, &startq;I &s;ee you are for the end
of the walk; this is my way.&endq; With the&s;e
words he took his leave of the &s;aunterer, who
would have delayed his retreat, by calling to him
aloud, that he had not yet de&s;cribed the &s;ituation
of his c$&s;tle. But Peregrine, without &s;topping,
an&s;wered in the &s;ame tone, &startq;Another time w$ll
do as well;&endq; and in a moment di&s;appeared, leav|ing
the projector very much mortified with his di&s;|appointment;
for his intention was to clo&s;e the
de&s;cription, with a demand of twenty pieces, to
be repaid out of the fir&s;t remittance he &s;hould re|ceive
from his e&s;tate.</P>
<P>It would have been well for our hero, had he
always acted with the &s;ame circum&s;pection: but
he had his unguarded moments, in which he fell
a prey to the un&s;u&s;pecting integrity of his own
heart. There was a per&s;on among the number
of his acquaintances, who&s;e conver&s;ation he par|ticularly
reli&s;hed, becau&s;e it was frank, agreeable,
<PB N="49" REF="55">
and fraught with many &s;en&s;ible ob&s;ervations upon
the cra&s;t and treachery of mankind. This gen|tleman
had made &s;hift to di&s;cu&s;s a very genteel
fortune, though it was &s;pent with ta&s;te and re|putation,
and now was reduced to his &s;hifts for
the maintenance of his family, which con&s;i&s;ted
of a wife and child. Not that he was de&s;titute
of the nece&s;&s;aries of life, being comfortably &s;up|plied
by the bounty of his friends: but this was
a provi&s;ion not at all &s;uited to his inclination;
and he had endeavoured, by divers un&s;ucce&s;sful
&s;chemes, to retrieve his former independency.</P>
<P>Peregrine happened one evening to be &s;itting
alone in a coffee-hou&s;e, where he over-heard a
conver&s;ation between this &s;chemer and another gen|tleman,
touching an affair that engaged his atten|tion.
The &s;tranger had been left tru&s;tee for fif|teen
hundred pounds bequeathed to the other's
daughter by an aunt, and was &s;trongly &s;olicited
to pay the money to the child's father, who a&s;|&s;ured
him, he had then an opportunity to lay it
out in &s;uch a manner, as would greatly conduce
to the advantage of his family. The tru&s;tee re|minded
him of the nature of hi$ charge, which
made him accountable for the mone$, until the
child &s;hould have attained the age of eighteen;
but at the &s;ame time gave him to under&s;tand,
that if he could procure &s;uch &s;ecurity as would
indemni&s;y him from the con&s;equences, he would
forthwith pay the legacy into his hands. To this
propo&s;al the father replied, that it was not to be
&s;uppo&s;ed he would ri&s;que the fortune of his only
child, upon any idle or precarious i&s;&s;ue; and
therefore he thought it rea&s;onable, that he &s;hould
have the u&s;e of it in the mean time; and that, as
to &s;ecurity, he was lo$h to trouble any of his
<PB N="50" REF="56">
friends about an affair which might be compro|mi&s;ed
without their interpo&s;ition; ob&s;erving, that
he would not look upon his conde&s;cen&s;ion as a
favour, if obtained by a &s;ecurity, on which he
could borrow the &s;ame &s;um from any u&s;urer in
town.</P>
<P>After much importunity on one &s;ide, and eva|&s;ion
on the other, the money'd gentleman told
him, that though he would not &s;urrender the
&s;um depo&s;ited in his hands, for the u&s;e of his
daughter, he would lend him what he &s;hould
have occa&s;ion for, in the mean time; and if, up|on
her being of age, he &s;hould be able to obtain
her concurrence, the money &s;hould be placed to
her account; provided he could find any per&s;on
of credit, who would join with him in a bond,
for the a&s;&s;urance of the lender. This provi&s;o
was an ob&s;truction which the other would not
have been able to &s;urmount, without great diffi|culty,
had not his cau&s;e been e&s;pou&s;ed by our
hero, who thought it was pity a man of honour
and under&s;tanding &s;hould &s;uffer in his principal
concerns, on &s;uch a paultry con&s;ideration. He
therefore, pre&s;uming on his acquaintance, inter|po&s;ed
in the conver&s;ation as a friend, who in|tere&s;ted
him&s;elf in the affair; and being fully in|formed
of the particulars, offered him&s;elf as a
&s;ecurity for the lender.</P>
<P>This gentleman being a &s;tranger to Peregrine,
was next day made acquainted with his funds;
and, without farther &s;cruple, accommodated his
friend with one thou&s;and pounds, for which he
took their bond, payable in &s;ix months, though
he prote&s;ted that the money &s;hould never be de|manded,
until the infant &s;hould be of age, unle&s;s
&s;ome accident &s;hould happen which he could not
<PB N="51" REF="57">
then fore&s;ee. Pickle believed this declaration &s;in|cere,
becau&s;e he could have no intere&s;t in di&s;|&s;embling:
but what he chiefly depended upon,
for his own &s;ecurity, was the integrity and con|fidence
of the borrower, who a&s;&s;ured him, that
happen what will, he &s;hould be able to &s;tand be|tween
him and all danger; the nature of his plan
being &s;uch, as would infallibly treble the &s;um in a
very few months.</P>
<P>In a little time after this tran&s;action, writs be|ing
i&s;&s;ued out for electing a new parliament, our
adventurer, by the advice of his patron, went
into the country, in order to canva&s;s for a bo|rough,
and lined his pockets with a competent
&s;hare of bank-notes for the occa&s;ion. But, in
this project, he unfortunately happened to inter|fere
with the intere&s;t of a great family in the op|po&s;ition,
who, for a long &s;eries of years, had
made members for that place; and were now &s;o
much offended at the intru&s;ion of our young
gentleman, that they threatened to &s;pend ten
thou&s;and pounds in fru&s;trating his de&s;ign. This
menace was no other than an incitement to Pe|regrine,
who confided &s;o much in his own in|fluence
and addre&s;s, that he verily believed he
&s;hould be able to battle his grace, even in his
own territories, and by that victory e&s;tabli&s;h his
reputation and intere&s;t with the mini&s;ter, who,
through the recommendation of his noble friend,
countenanced his cau&s;e, and would have been
very well plea&s;ed to &s;ee one of his greate&s;t $word$
&s;uffer &s;uch a di&s;graceful overthrow, w$$$$
would have, moreover, in a great mea&s;ure &s;haken
$word$ credit with his f$ction.</P>
<P>Our hero, intoxicated with the ideas of pride
$word$ ambition, put all his talents to the $word$ in the
<PB N="52" REF="58">
execution of this project. He &s;pared no expence
in treating the electors; but finding him&s;elf ri|valled,
in this re&s;pect, by his competitor, who
was powerfully &s;upported, he had recour&s;e to
tho&s;e qualifications in which he thought him&s;elf
&s;uperior. He made balls for the ladies, vi&s;ited
the matrons of the corporation, adapted him&s;elf
to their various humours with &s;urpri&s;ing facility,
drank with tho&s;e who loved a cheri&s;hing cup in
private, made love to the amorous, prayed with
the religious, go&s;&s;iped with tho&s;e who delighted
in &s;candal, and with great &s;agacity contrived
agreeable pre&s;ents to them all. This was the
mo&s;t effectual method of engaging &s;uch electors
as were under the influence of their wives; and
as for the re&s;t, he a&s;&s;ailed them in their own
way, &s;etting whole hog&s;heads of beer and wine
abroach, for the benefit of all comers; and into
tho&s;e fordid hearts that liquor would not open,
he found means to convey him&s;elf by the help of
a golden key.</P>
<P>While he thus exerted him&s;elf, his antagoni&s;t
was not idle; his age and infirmities would not
permit him to enter per&s;onally into their parties;
but his &s;teward and adherents be&s;tirred them|&s;elves
with great indu&s;try and per&s;everance; and
the market for votes ran &s;o high, that Pickle's
ready money was exhau&s;ted before the day of
election; and he was obliged to write to his pa|tron
an account of the dilemma to which he was
reduced; intreating him to take &s;uch &s;peedy mea|&s;ures,
as would enable him to fini&s;h the bu&s;ine&s;s
which he had &s;o happily begun.</P>
<P>This nobleman communicated the circum|&s;tances
of the ca&s;e to the mini&s;ter, and in a day
or two our candidate found credit with the re|ceiver-general
<PB N="53" REF="59">
of the county, who lent him
twelve hundred pounds on his per&s;onal note,
payable on demand. By means of this new &s;up|ply,
he managed matters &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully, that an
evident majority of votes was &s;ecured in his inte|re&s;t;
and nothing could have ob&s;tructed his elec|tion,
had not the noble peer who &s;et up his com|petitor,
in order to avoid the &s;hame and mortifi|cation
of being foiled in his own borough, offer|ed
to compromi&s;e the affair with his honour, by
giving up two members in another place, pro|vided
the oppo&s;ition &s;hould cea&s;e in his own cor|poration.
This propo&s;al was greedily embraced;
and, on the eve of election, Peregrine received
an intimation from his patron, de&s;iring him to
quit his preten&s;ions, on pain of his and the mini|&s;ter's
di&s;plea&s;ure; and promi&s;ing that he &s;hould
be elected for another place.</P>
<P>No other di&s;appointment in life could have given
him &s;uch chagrin as he felt at the receit of this
tantalizing order, by which the cup of &s;ucce&s;s was
&s;natched from his lip, and all the vanity of his
ambitious hope humbled in the du&s;t. He curs'd
the whole chain of his court connexions, inveigh|ed
with great animo&s;ity again&s;t the ra&s;cally
&s;cheme of politicks, to which he was &s;acrificed;
and in conclu&s;ion &s;wore he would not give up the
fruits of his own addre&s;s for the plea&s;ure of any
mini&s;ter upon earth. This laudable re&s;olution,
however, was rendered ineffectual by his friend
the receiver-general, who was bearer of the
me&s;&s;age, and (after having, in vain, endeavoured
to per&s;uade him to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion) fairly arre&s;ted him
upon the &s;pot for the money he had advanced;
this expedient being performed by virtue of a writ
<PB N="54" REF="60">
which he had been advi&s;ed to take out, in ca&s;e
the young man &s;hould prove refractory.</P>
<P>The reader, who, by this time, mu&s;t be
pretty well acquainted with the di&s;po&s;ition of our
adventurer, may ea&s;ily conceive how he reli&s;hed
this impri&s;onment. At fir&s;t, all the faculties of
his &s;oul were &s;wallowed up in a&s;toni&s;hment and
indignation; and &s;ome minutes elap&s;ed before
his nerves would obey the impul&s;e of his rage,
which manife&s;ted it&s;elf in &s;uch an application to
the temples of the plaintiff, as laid him &s;prawling
on the floor. This a&s;&s;ault, which was committed
in a tavern whither he had been purpo&s;ely de|coyed,
attracted the regard of the bailiff and his
followers, who, to the number of four, ru&s;hed
upon him at once, in order to overpower him;
but his wrath in&s;pired him with &s;uch additional
&s;trength and agility, that he di&s;engaged him&s;elf
from them in a trice, and &s;eizing a poker, which
was the fir&s;t weapon that pre&s;ented it&s;elf to his
hand, exerci&s;ed it upon their &s;kulls with incre|dible
dexterity and execution. The officer him|&s;elf,
who had been the fir&s;t that pre&s;umed to la$
violent hands upon him, felt the fir&s;t effects of
his fury, in a blow upon the jaws, in con&s;equence
of which he lo&s;t three of his teeth, and fell
athwart the body of the receiver, with which he
form'd the figure of a St. Andrew's cro&s;s: one of
his myrmidons &s;eeing the fate of his chief, would
not venture to attack the victor in front, but
wheeling to one &s;ide, made an attempt upon him
in flank, and was received obliquely by our he|ro's
left hand and foot, &s;o ma&s;terly di&s;po&s;ed to t$e
right &s;ide of h$s leg, and the left &s;ide of his neck,
that he bolted head foremo&s;t into the chimney,
<PB N="55" REF="61">
where his chin was encountered by the grate,
which, in a moment, feared him to the bone.
The re&s;t of the detachment did not think proper
to maintain the di&s;pute, but evacuating the room
with great expedition, locked the door on the
out&s;ide, and bellowed aloud to the receiver's &s;er|vants,
be&s;eeching them to come to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
of their ma&s;ter, who was in danger of his life.</P>
<P>Mean while, this gentleman having recollect|ed
him&s;elf, demanded a parley; which having
with difficulty obtained of our incen&s;ed candi|date,
in con&s;equence of the mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive ap|plication,
he complained grievou&s;ly of the young
g$ntleman's intemperance and heat of di&s;po&s;ition,
and very calmly repre&s;ented the danger of his
r$&s;hne&s;s and indi&s;cretion. He told him, that
nothing could be more outrageous or idle, than
the re&s;i&s;tance he had made again&s;t the laws of his
country, becau&s;e he would find it impracticable
to with&s;tand the whole executive power of the
county, which he could ea&s;ily rai&s;e to apprehend
and &s;ecure him; that over and above the di&s;grace
that would accrue to him from this imprudent
conduct, he would knock his own intere&s;t on
the head, by di&s;obliging his friends in the admi|ni&s;tration,
who were, to his knowledge, at pre|&s;ent
very well di&s;po&s;ed to do him &s;ervice; that,
for his own part, what he had done was by the
$word$ order of his &s;uperiors, and not out of any
$word$ of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing him; and that, far from be|$$$
his enemy, notwith&s;tanding the &s;hocking $word$
he had &s;u&s;tained, he was ready to withdraw
$word$, provided he would li&s;ten to any rea&s;on|$$$$
terms of accommodation.</P>
<P>Peregrine, who was not m$r$ prone to anger
$word$ open to conviction, being appea&s;ed by his
<PB N="56" REF="62">
conde&s;cen&s;ion, moved by his arguments, and
chid by his own reflection for what he had done
in the precipitation of his wrath, began to give
ear to his remon&s;trances; and the bailiffs being
ordered to withdraw, they entered into a confe|rence,
the re&s;ult of which was our adventurer's
immediate departure for London: &s;o that next
day his competitor was unanimou&s;ly cho&s;en, be|cau&s;e
no body appeared to oppo&s;e his election.</P>
<P>The di&s;contented Pickle, on his arrival in
town, went directly to the hou&s;e of his patron,
to whom, in the angui&s;h of his di&s;appointment,
he bitterly complained of the treatment he had
received, by which, be&s;ides the di&s;grace of his
overthrow, he was no le&s;s than two thou&s;and
pounds out of pocket, exclu&s;ive of the debt for
which he &s;tood engaged to the receiver. His
lord&s;hip, who was prepared for this expo&s;tula|tion,
on his knowledge of the young man's im|petuous
temper, an&s;wered all the articles of his
charge with great deliberation, giving him to un|der&s;tand
the motives that induced the mini&s;ter to
quit his intere&s;t in that borough; and &s;oothing
him with a&s;&s;urances that his lo&s;s would be amply
rewarded by his honour, to whom he was next
day introduced by this nobleman, in the warme&s;t
&s;tile of recommendation. The mini&s;ter, who
was a pattern of complai&s;ance, received him with
the mo&s;t engaging affability; thanked him very
kindly for his endeavours to &s;upport and &s;trengthen
the intere&s;t of the admini&s;tration; and faithfully
promi&s;ed to lay hold on the fir&s;t opportunity to
expre&s;s the &s;en&s;e he had of his zeal and attach|ment;
de&s;iring to &s;ee him often at his levee, that
in the multipl$city $f bu&s;ine&s;s he might not be
in danger of forgetting his &s;ervices and de&s;ert.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Peregrine commences mini&s;ter's dependent; meets

gradually, in the condition of life.</HEAD>
<P>THIS reception, favourable as it was, did
not plea&s;e Peregrine, who had too much
di&s;cernment to be cajoled with general promi&s;es,
at a time when he thought him&s;elf intitled to the
mo&s;t particular a&s;&s;urance. He accordingly &s;igni|fied
his di&s;gu&s;t to his introductor, giving him to
under&s;tand, that he had la$$ his account with be|ing
cho&s;en repre&s;entative of one of th$&s;e boroughs
for which he had been &s;acrificed. His lord&s;hip
agreed to the rea&s;onablene&s;s of his expectation,
o$&s;erving, however, that he could not &s;uppo&s;e
the mini&s;ter would enter upon bu&s;ine&s;s with him,
on his fir&s;t vi&s;it; and that it would be time
enough, at his next audience, to communicate
his demand.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this remon&s;trance, our hero
continued to indulge his &s;u&s;picion and chagrin,
and even made a point of it with his patron, that
his lord&s;hip &s;hould next day make application in
h$s behalf, left the two &s;eats &s;hould be filled up,
on pretence of his inclination's being unknown.
Thus importuned, my lord went to his principal,
and returned with an an&s;wer, importing th$t his
honour was extremely &s;orry that Mr. Pickle had
not &s;ignified his reque&s;t before the boroughs in
que&s;tion were promi&s;ed to two gentlemen whom
he could not now di&s;appoint, with any regard to
his own credit or intere&s;t; but as &s;everal per&s;ons
<PB N="58" REF="64">
who would be cho&s;en were, to his certain know|ledge,
very aged and infirm, he did not doubt
that there would be plenty of vacant &s;eats in a
very &s;hort time; and then the young gentleman
might depend upon his friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Peregrine was &s;o much irritated at this intima|tion,
that in the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of his anger he
forgot the re&s;pect he owed to his friend, and in
his pre&s;ence inveighed again&s;t the mini&s;ter, as a
per&s;on devoid of gratitude and candour, prote&s;t|ing,
that if ever an opportunity &s;hould offer it|&s;elf,
he would &s;pend the whole remains of his
fortune in oppo&s;ing his mea&s;ures. The nobleman
having given him time to exhau&s;t the impetuo&s;ity
of his pa&s;&s;ion, rebuked him very calmly for his
di&s;re&s;pectful expre&s;&s;ions, which were equally in|jurious
and indi&s;creet; a&s;&s;ured him that his pro|ject
of revenge, if ever put in execution, would
redound to his own prejudice and confu&s;ion; and
advi&s;ed him to cultivate and improve, with pa|tience
and a&s;&s;iduity, the footing he had already
obtained in the mini&s;ter's good graces.</P>
<P>Our hero convinced of the truth, tho' not &s;a|tisfied
with the occa&s;ion of his admonitions, took
his leave in a fit of &s;ullen di&s;content, and began
to ruminate upon the &s;hattered po&s;ture of his af|fairs.
All that now remained of the ample for|tune
he had inherited, was the &s;um he had depo|&s;ited
in his lord&s;hip's hands, together with fifteen
hundred pounds he had ventured on bottomry,
and the gari&s;on, which he had left for the u&s;e and
accommodation of the lieutenant; and on the
per contra &s;ide of his account he was debtor for
the &s;upply he had received from the receiver-ge|neral,
and the money for which he was bound in
<PB N="59" REF="65">
behalf of his friend; &s;o that he found him&s;elf,
for the fir&s;t time of his life, very much emba|ra&s;&s;ed
in his circum&s;tances: for, of the fir&s;t half
year's intere&s;t of his ten thou&s;and, which was
punctually paid, he had but four&s;core pounds in
bank, without any pro&s;pect of a farther &s;upply,
$word$ the other term, which was at the di&s;tance of
four l$ng months. He &s;eriou&s;ly reflected upon
the uncertainty of human affairs; the &s;hip with
$word$ fifteen hundred pounds might be lo&s;t, the
gentleman for whom he was &s;ecurity, might
mi&s;carry in this, as well as in his former projects,
and the mini&s;ter might one day, through policy
or di&s;plea&s;ure, expo&s;e him to the mercy of his
dependant, who was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his notes.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions did not at all contribute to
the ea&s;e of our adventurer's mind, already ruffled
by his di&s;appointment. He cur&s;ed his own &s;olly
and extravagance, by which he was reduced to
&s;uch an uncomfortable &s;ituation. He compared
his own conduct with that of &s;ome young gen|tlemen
of his acquaintance, who, while he was
&s;quandering away the be&s;t part of his inheritance,
had improved their fortunes, &s;trengthened their
intere&s;t, and increa&s;ed their reputation. He was
abandoned by his gayety and good humour, his
countenance gradually contracted it&s;elf into a re|pre&s;entation
of &s;everity and care, he dropped all
his amu&s;ements and the companions of his plea|&s;ure,
and turned his whole attention to the mi|ni&s;ter,
at who&s;e levee he never failed to appear.</P>
<P>While he thus laboured in the wheel of de|pendance,
with all that mortification which a
youth of his pride and &s;en&s;ibility may be &s;uppo&s;ed
to feel from &s;uch a di&s;agreeable nece&s;&s;ity, he one
day heard him&s;elf called by name, as he cro&s;&s;ed
<PB N="60" REF="66">
the Park; and turning, perceived the wife of
captain Gauntlet, with another lady. He no
&s;ooner recognized the kind Sophy, than he ac|co&s;ted
her with his wonted civility of friend&s;hip;
but his former &s;prightly air was metamorpho&s;ed
into &s;uch an au&s;terity, or rather dejection of fea|ture,
that &s;he could &s;carce believe her own eyes;
and in her a&s;toni&s;hment &startq;Is it po&s;&s;ible (&s;aid &s;he)
that the gay Mr. Pickle &s;hould be &s;o much altered
in &s;uch a &s;hort &s;pace of time!&endq; He made no
other reply to this exclamation, but by a languid
&s;mile; and a&s;ked how long &s;he had been in town;
ob&s;erving, that he would have paid his compli|ments
to her at her own lodgings, had he been
favoured with the lea&s;t intimation of her arrival.
After having thanked him for his politene&s;s, &s;he
told him, it was not owing to any abatement of
her friend&s;hip and e&s;teem for him, that &s;he had
omitted to give him that notice; but his abrupt
departure from Wind&s;or, and the manner in
which he quitted Mr. Gauntlet, had given her
ju&s;t grounds to believe, that they had incurred
his di&s;plea&s;ure; which &s;u&s;picion was reinforced
by his long &s;ilence and neglect from that period,
to the pre&s;ent time; when &s;he ob&s;erved, it was
&s;till farther confirmed, by his forbearing to in|quire
for Emilia and her brother: &startq;Judge then,
(&s;aid &s;he) if I had any rea&s;on to believe that you
would be plea&s;ed to hear that I was in town.
However, I will not detain you at pre&s;ent, be|cau&s;e
you &s;eem to be engaged about &s;ome parti|cular
bu&s;ine&s;s; but, if you will favour me with
your company at breakfa&s;t to-morrow, I &s;hall be
much plea&s;ed, and honoured to boot, by the
vi&s;it.&endq; So &s;aying, &s;he gave him a direction to
her lodgings; and he took his leave, with a
<PB N="61" REF="67">
faithful promi&s;e of &s;eeing her at the appointed
time.</P>
<P>He was very much affected with this advance
of Sophy, which he con&s;idered as an in&s;tance of
her uncommon &s;weetne&s;s of temper; he felt &s;trange
longings of returning friend&s;hip towards Godfrey;
and the remembrance of Emilia melted his heart,
already &s;oftened with grief and mortification.
Next day, he did not neglect his engagement,
and had the plea&s;ure of enjoying a long conver|&s;ation
with this &s;en&s;ible young lady, who gave
him to under&s;tand, that her hu&s;band was with
his regiment; and pre&s;ented to him a fine boy,
the fir&s;t fruits of their love, whom they had
chri&s;tened by the name of Peregrine, in memory
of the friend&s;hip which had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between
Godfrey and our youth.</P>
<P>This proof of their regard, notwith&s;tanding
the interruption in their corre&s;pondence, made a
deep impre&s;&s;ion upon the mind of our adventurer,
who having made the warme&s;t acknowledgements
for this unde&s;erved mark of re&s;pect, took the
child in his arms, and almo&s;t devoured him with
ki&s;&s;es, prote&s;ting before God, that he &s;hould al|ways
con&s;ider him with the tenderne&s;s of a pa|rent.
This was the highe&s;t compliment he could
pay to the gentle Sophy, who again kindly chid
him for his di&s;dainful and precipitate retreat, im|mediately
after her marriage; and expre&s;&s;ed an
earne&s;t de&s;ire of &s;eeing him and the captain re|conciled.
He a&s;&s;ured her, nothing could give
him greater &s;atisfaction than &s;uch an event, to
which he would contribute all that lay in his
power, though he could not help looking upon
him&s;elf as injured by captain Gauntlet's beha|viour,
which denoted a &s;u&s;picion of his honour,
<PB N="62" REF="68">
as well as contempt for his under&s;tanding. The
lady undertook for the conce&s;&s;ion of her hu&s;band,
who (&s;he told him) had been extremely &s;orry for
his own heat, after Mr. Pickle's departure, and
would have followed him to the gari&s;on, in order
to &s;olicit his forgivene&s;s, had not he been re|&s;trained
by certain punctilio's, occa&s;ioned by &s;ome
acrimonious expre&s;&s;ions that dropt from Peregrine
at the inn.</P>
<P>After having cleared up this mi&s;under&s;tanding,
&s;he proceeded to give an account of Emilia,
who&s;e behaviour, at that juncture, plainly indi|cated
a continuance of affection for her fir&s;t lo|ver;
and de&s;ired, that he would give her full
powers to bring that matter al&s;o to an accommo|dation:
&startq;For I am not more certain of my
own exi&s;tence (&s;aid &s;he) than that you are &s;till in
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my &s;i&s;ter's heart.&endq; At this declara|tion,
the tear &s;tarted in his eye, while he &s;hook
his head, and declined her good offices, wi&s;hing
that the young lady might be much more happy
than ever he &s;hould be able to make her.</P>
<P>Mrs. Gauntlet, confounded at the&s;e expre&s;|&s;ions,
and moved by the de&s;pondent manner in
which they were delivered, begg'd to know if
any new ob&s;tacle was rai&s;ed, by &s;ome late change
in his &s;entiments or &s;ituation: and he, in order
to avoid a painful explanation, told her, that he
had long de&s;paired of being able to vanqui&s;h Emi|lia's
re&s;entment, and for that rea&s;on quitted the
pur&s;uit, which he would never renew, how&s;o|ever
his heart might &s;uffer by that re&s;olution;
though he took heaven to witne&s;s, that his love,
e&s;teem, and admiration of her were not in the
lea&s;t impaired: but the true motive of his laying
a&s;ide this de&s;ign, was the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his
<PB N="63" REF="69">
decayed fortune, which, by adding to the &s;en&s;i|bility
of his pride, increa&s;ed the horror of an|other
repul&s;e. She expre&s;&s;ed her concern for this
determination, both on his own account, and in
behalf of Emilia, who&s;e happine&s;s (in her opi|nion)
depended upon his con&s;tancy and affec|t$on;
and &s;he would have que&s;tioned him more
minutely about the &s;tate of his affairs, had not he
di&s;couraged the inquiry, by &s;eeking to introduce
another &s;ubject of conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>After mutual prote&s;tations of friend&s;hip and re|gard,
he promi&s;ed to vi&s;it her often, during her
re&s;idence in town; and took his leave in a &s;trange
perplexity of mind, occa&s;ioned by the images of
love, intruding upon the remon&s;trances of carking
care. He had &s;ome time ago for&s;aken tho&s;e ex|travagant
companions with whom he had rioted
in the h$yday of his fortune, and began to con|&s;ort
with a graver and more &s;ober &s;pecies of ac|quaintance$
but he now found him&s;elf di&s;abled
$word$ cultivating the &s;ociety of the&s;e al&s;o, who
were men of ample e&s;tates and liberal di&s;po&s;itions;
in con&s;equence of which, their parties were too
expen&s;ive for the con&s;umptive &s;tate of his fi|nances;
&s;o that he was obliged to de&s;cend ano|ther
degree, and mingle with a &s;et of old batche|lors
and younger brothers, who &s;ub&s;i&s;ted on &s;lender
annuities, or what is called a bare competency in
the public funds. This a&s;&s;ociation was compo&s;ed
of &s;econd-hand politicians and minor critics, who
in the $$renoon &s;aunter in the Mall, or lounge at
&s;h$ws of pictures, appear in the drawing-room
once or twice a week, dine at an ordinary, $word$
di&s;putes in a coffee-hou&s;e, with an air of $word$
intelligence, frequent the pit of the $word$
a$d once in a month &s;pend an evening
<PB N="64" REF="70">
with &s;ome noted actor, who&s;e remarkable &s;ay|ings
they repeat for the entertainment of their
ordinary friends.</P>
<P>After all, he found &s;omething comfortable
enough in the company of the&s;e gentlemen, who
never intere&s;ted his pa&s;&s;ions to any violence of
tran&s;port, nor teazed him with impertinent cu|rio&s;ity
about his private affairs: for though many
of them had maintained a very long, clo&s;e, and
friendly corre&s;pondence with each other, they
never dreamt of inquiring into particular con|cerns;
and if one of the two who were mo&s;t
intimately connected, had been a&s;ked how the
other made &s;hift to live, he would have an&s;wered,
with great truth, &startq;Really, that is more than I
know.&endq; Notwith&s;tanding this phlegmatic indif|ference,
which is of the true Engli&s;h production,
they were all inoffen&s;ive, good-natured people,
who loved a joke and a &s;ong, delighted in telling
a merry &s;tory, and prided them&s;elves in the art of
catering, e&s;pecially in the articles of fre&s;h veni&s;on
and wild fowl.</P>
<P>Our young gentleman was not received among
them on the footing of a common member, who
makes intere&s;t for his admi&s;&s;ion; he was courted
as a per&s;on of &s;uperior genius and importance,
and his compliance looked upon as an honour to
their &s;ociety. This their idea of his prehemi|nence
was &s;upported by his conver&s;ation, which,
while it was more liberal and learned than that
to which they had been accu&s;tomed, was tinc|tured
with an a&s;&s;uming air, &s;o agreeably diffu&s;ed,
that in&s;tead of producing aver&s;ion, it commanded
re&s;pect. They not only appealed to him, in all
doubts relating to foreign parts, to which one
and all of them were &s;trangers, but al&s;o con&s;ulted
<PB N="65" REF="71">
his knowledge in hi&s;tory and divinity, which
were frequently the topics of their debates; and
in poetry of all kinds, he decided with &s;uch ma|gi&s;terial
authority, as even weighed again&s;t the
opinions of the players them&s;elves. The variety
of characters he had &s;een and ob&s;erved, and the
high &s;pheres of life in which he had &s;o lately
moved, furni&s;hed him with a thou&s;and entertain|ing
anecdotes; and when he became a little fa|miliarized
to his di&s;appointments, &s;o that his na|tural
vivacity began to revive, he fla&s;hed among
them in &s;uch a number of bright &s;allies, as &s;truck
them with admiration, and con&s;tituted him&s;elf a
cla&s;&s;ic in wit: in&s;om$ch that they began to retail
his remnants, and even invited &s;ome particular
friends to come and hear him hold forth. One
of the players, who had for many years &s;trutted
about the taverns in the neighbourhood of Co|vent-garden,
as the Grand Turk of wit and hu|mour,
began to find his admirers melt away;
and a certain petulant phy&s;ician, who had &s;hone
at almo&s;t all the Port-clubs in that end of the
town, was actually obliged to import his talents
into the city, where he has now happily taken
$oot.</P>
<P>Nor was this &s;ucce&s;s to be wondered at, if we
con&s;ider that, over and above his natural genius
and education, our adventurer &s;till had the op|portunity
of knowing every thing which hap|pened
among the great, by means of his friend
$adwallader, with whom he &s;till maintained his
f$rmer intimacy, though it was now checquered
with many occa&s;ional ti&s;ts, owing to the &s;arca&s;tic
remon&s;trances of the Mi&s;anthrope, who di&s;ap|proved
of tho&s;e &s;chemes which mi&s;carried with
Peregrine, and now took un&s;ea&s;onable methods
<PB N="66" REF="72">
of valuing him&s;elf upon his own fore&s;ight: nay,
he was between whiles like a raven croaking pre|&s;ages
of more ill luck from the deceit of the mi|ni&s;ter,
the di&s;&s;imulation of his patron, the folly
of the projector for whom he was bound, the
uncertainty of the &s;eas, and the villainy of tho&s;e
with whom he had entru&s;ted his c$&s;h: for Crab|tr$e
&s;aw and con&s;idered every thing through a
per&s;pective of &s;pleen, that always reflected the
wor&s;t &s;ide of human nature.</P>
<P>For the&s;e rea&s;ons, our young gentleman began
to be di&s;gu&s;ted, at certain intervals, with the
character of this old man, whom he now thought
a moro&s;e cynic, not &s;o much incen&s;ed again&s;t the
follies and vices of mankind, as delighted with
the di&s;tre&s;s of his fe$$ow creatures. Thus he put
the mo&s;t unfavourable con&s;truction on the prin|ciples
of his friend, becau&s;e he found him&s;elf
ju&s;tly fallen under the la&s;h of his animadver&s;ion.
This &s;elf-accu&s;ation very often di&s;&s;olves the clo&s;e&s;t
friend&s;hip: a man, con&s;cious of his own indi&s;|cretion,
is implacably offended at the rectitude of
his companion's conduct, which he con&s;iders as
an in&s;ult upon his failings, never to be forgiven,
even though he has not ta&s;ted the bitterne&s;s of
reproof, which no &s;inner can commodiou&s;ly di|ge&s;t.
The friend&s;hip, therefore, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting be|tween
Crabtree and Pickle, had of late &s;uffered
&s;everal &s;ymptomatic &s;hocks that &s;eemed to prog|no&s;$icate
a total di&s;&s;olution; a great deal of
&s;mart dialogue had pa&s;&s;ed in their private conver|&s;ations,
and the &s;enior began to repent of having
placed his confidence in &s;uch an imprudent, head-&s;trong,
ungovernable youth.</P>
<P>It was in &s;uch paroxy&s;ms of di&s;plea&s;ure, that
be prophe&s;ied misfortune to Peregrine, and even
<PB N="67" REF="73">
told him one morning, that he had dream'd of
the &s;hipwreck of the two Ea&s;t-Indiamen on board
of which he had hazarded his money. But this
was no other than a fal&s;e vi&s;ion; for, in a few
weeks, one of them arrived at her moorings in
the river, and he received a thou&s;and, in lieu of
eight hundred pounds which he had lent upon
bond to one of the mates. At the &s;ame time he
was informed, that the other &s;hip, in which he
was concerned, had, in all probability, lo&s;t her
pa&s;&s;age for the &s;ea&s;on, by being unable to wea|ther
the Cape. He was not at all concerned at
that piece of news, knowing, that the longer he
&s;hould lie out of his money, he would have the
more intere&s;t to receive; and finding his pre&s;ent
difficulties removed by this &s;upply, h$$ heart be|gan
to $$late, and his $word$ to re&s;ume its
$$rmer alacrity.</P>
<P>This &s;tate of exultation, however, was &s;oon
interrupted by a &s;mall accident, which he could
not fore&s;ee: he was vi&s;ited one morning by the
per&s;on who had lent his friend a thou&s;and pounds
on his &s;ecurity, and given to under&s;tand, that the
borrower had ab&s;conded, in con&s;equence $word$ a di&s;|appointment,
by which he had lo&s;t the whole
&s;um, and all hopes of retrieving it; &s;o that our
hero was now liable for the debt, which he be|&s;ought
him to di&s;charge according to the bond,
that he (the lender) might not &s;uffer by his hu|manity.
It may be ea&s;ily conceived, that Pere|grine
did not receive this intelligence in cold blood.
He cur&s;ed his own imprudence in contracting &s;$ch
engagements with an adventurer, whom he did
not &s;ufficiently know, exclaimed again&s;t the
treachery of the pro$ector; and having for &s;ome
time indulged his re&s;entment in threats and im|precations,
<PB N="68" REF="74">
inquired into the nature of the &s;cheme
which had mi&s;carried.</P>
<P>The lender, who had informed him&s;elf of the
whole affair, gratified his curio&s;ity in this parti|cular,
by telling him that the fugitive had been
cajoled by a certain knight of the po&s;t, who un|dertook
to manage the thou&s;and pounds in &s;uch
a manner, as would, in a very little time, make
him perfectly independant; and thus he deli|neated
the plan: &startq;One half of the &s;um (&s;aid
he) &s;hall be laid out in jewels, which I will
pawn to certain per&s;ons of credit and fortune,
who lend money upon &s;uch pledges at an exor|bitant
intere&s;t. The other &s;hall be kept for re|lieving
them, &s;o that they may be again depo&s;ited
with a &s;econd &s;et of tho&s;e honourable u&s;urers;
and when they &s;hall have been circulated in this
manner through a variety of hands, we will ex|tort
money from each of the pawn-brokers, by
threatening them with a public pro&s;ecution, for
exacting illegal intere&s;t; and I know that they
will bleed freely, rather than be expo&s;ed to the
infamy attending &s;uch an accu&s;ation.&endq; The
&s;cheme was fea&s;ible, and though not very ho|nourable,
made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon the
needy borrower, that he a&s;&s;ented to the propo&s;al$
and, by our hero's credit, the money was rai&s;ed.
The jewels were accordingly purcha&s;ed, pawne$,
relieved, and re-pledged by the agent, who un|dertook
to manage the whole affair; and &s;o ju|diciou&s;ly
was the project executed, that he coul$
have ea&s;ily proved each lender guilty of the
charge. Having thus far &s;ucce&s;sfully tran&s;act$$
the bu&s;ine&s;s, this faithful agent vi&s;ited them &s;eve|rally
on his own account, to give them intima|tion,
that his employer intended to &s;ue them $word$
<PB N="69" REF="75">
the &s;tatute of u&s;ury; upon which, every one,
for him&s;elf, bribed the informer to withdraw his
evidence, by which alone he could be convicted;
and having received the&s;e gratifications, he had
thought proper to retreat into France, with the
whole booty, including the original thou&s;and that
put them in motion. In con&s;equence of this
decampment, the borrower had withdrawn him|&s;elf;
&s;o that the lender was obliged to have re|cour&s;e
to his &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>This was a very mortifying account to our
young gentleman, who in vain reminded the
narrator of his promi&s;e, importing, that he would
not demand the money, until he &s;hould be called
to an account by his ward; and ob&s;erved, that
long before that period, the fugitive might ap|pear
and di&s;charge the debt. But the other was
deaf to the&s;e remon&s;trances; alledging, that his
promi&s;e was provi&s;ional, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that
the borrower would deal candidly and fairly;
that he had forfeited all title to his friend&s;hip and
tru&s;t, by the &s;candalous &s;cheme in which he had
embarked; and that his treacherous flight from
his &s;ecurity was no proof of his hone&s;ty and in|tended
return; but on the contrary, a warning,
by which he (the lender) was taught to take
care of him&s;elf. He therefore in&s;i&s;ted upon h$s
being indemnified immediately, on pain of letting
the law take its cour&s;e; and Peregrine was ac|tually
obliged to part with the whole &s;um he had
&s;o lately received. But this payment was not
made without extreme reluctance, indignation,
and denunciation of eternal war again&s;t the ab|&s;conder,
and the rigid creditor, betwixt whom
he &s;u&s;pected &s;ome collu&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Cadwallader acts the part of a comforter to his

<P>THIS new misfortune, which he ju&s;tly
charged to the account of his own folly,
recalled his chagrin; and though he endeavoured
with all his might to conceal the affair from the
knowledge of Cadwallader, that prying ob&s;erver
perceived his countenance overca&s;t; and the pro|jector's
&s;udden di&s;appearance alarming his &s;u&s;pi|cion,
he managed his inquiries with &s;o much art,
that in a few days he made him&s;elf acquainted
with every particular of the tran&s;action, and re|&s;olved
to gratify his &s;pleen at the expence of the
impatient dupe. With this view, he took an
opportunity to acco&s;t him with a very &s;erious air,
&s;aying, a friend of his had immediate occa&s;ion
for a thou&s;and pounds, and as Peregrine had the

The Mi&s;anthrope, not contented with
this irritation, a&s;&s;umed the prerogative of a
friend, and que&s;tioned him &s;o minutely about the
di&s;po&s;al of the ca&s;h, that after numberle&s;s eva|&s;ions,
<PB N="71" REF="77">
which co&s;t him a world of torture to in|vent,
he could contain his vexation no longer,
but exclaimed in a rage, &startq;Damn your imperti|nence!
'tis gone to the devil, and that's enough!&endq;
&startq;Thereafter as it may be (&s;aid this tormentor,
with a mo&s;t provoking indifference of a&s;pect) I
&s;hould be glad to know upon what &s;ooting; for
I &s;uppo&s;e you have &s;ome expectation of advan|tage
from that quarter.&endq; &startq;'Sdeath! Sir (cried
the impatient youth) if I had any expectation
from hell, I would make intere&s;t with you, for I
believe from my &s;oul, you are one of its mo&s;t
favoured mini&s;ters upon earth.&endq; With the&s;e
words, he flung out of the room, leaving Cad|wallader
very well &s;atisfied with the cha&s;ti&s;ement
he had be&s;towed.</P>
<P>Peregrine having cooled him&s;elf with a &s;olitary
walk in the park, during which the violence of
his choler gradually evaporated, and his reflection
was called to a &s;erious deliberation upon the
po&s;ture of his affairs; he re&s;olved to redouble his
diligence and importunity with his patron and the
mini&s;ter, in order to obtain &s;ome fine-cure,
which would indemnify him for the damage he
had &s;u&s;tained on their account. He accordingly
went to his lord&s;hip, and &s;ignified his demand,
after having told him, that he had &s;uffered &s;eve|ral
fre&s;h lo&s;&s;es, which rendered an immediate
provi&s;ion of that &s;ort nece&s;&s;ary to his credit and
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>His noble friend commended him for the re|gard
he manife&s;ted for his own intere&s;t, which
he con&s;idered as a proof of his being at la&s;t de|tached
from the carele&s;s inadvertency of youth;
he approved of his demand, which, he a&s;&s;ured
him, &s;hould be faithfully tran&s;mitted to the mi|ni&s;ter,
<PB N="72" REF="78">
and backed with all his influence; and
encouraged his hope, by ob&s;erving, that &s;ome
profitable places were at that time vacant, and,
&s;o far as he knew, unengaged.</P>
<P>This conver&s;ation helped to re&s;tore the tran|quillity
of Pickle's brea&s;t, tho' he &s;till harboured
re&s;entment again&s;t Cadwallader, on account of
the la&s;t in&s;ult; and on the in&s;tant he formed a plan
of revenge. He knew the mi&s;anthrope's remit|tances
from his e&s;tate in the country, had been
of late very &s;canty, in con&s;equence of repairs and
bankruptcies among his tenants: &s;o that, in &s;pite
of all his frugality, he had been but barely able to
maintain his credit, and even that was engaged
on the &s;trength of his running rent. Being there|fore
intimately acquainted with the particulars of
his fortune, he wrote a letter to Crabtree, &s;ub|&s;cribed
with the name of his principal farmer's
wife, importing, that her hu&s;band being lately
dead, and the greate&s;t part of her cattle de&s;troy|ed
by the infectious di&s;temper, &s;$e found her&s;elf
utterly incapable of paying the rent which was
due, or even of keeping the farm, unle&s;s he
would, out of his great goodne&s;s, be plea&s;ed to
give her &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance and allow her to &s;it free
for a twelvemonth to come. This intimation he
found means to convey by po&s;t from a market-town
adjoining to the farm, directed in the u&s;ual
&s;tile to the cynic, who &s;eeing it &s;tamped with the
known marks, could not po&s;&s;ibly &s;u&s;pect any im|po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Hackneyed as he was in the ways of life, and
&s;teeled with his boa&s;ted &s;toici&s;m, this epi&s;tle
threw him into &s;uch an agony of vexation, that a
double proportion of &s;owering was vi&s;ible in his a&s;|pect,
when he was vi&s;ited by the author, who
<PB N="73" REF="79">
having ob&s;erved and followed the po&s;tman at a
proper di&s;tance, introduced a conver&s;ation upon
his own di&s;appointments, in which, among other
circum&s;tances of his own ill-luck, he told him,
that his patron's &s;teward had de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed
from paying the la&s;t quarter of his intere&s;t pre|ci&s;ely
at the appointed term; for which rea&s;on,
he &s;hould be utterly void of ca&s;h; and therefore
reque&s;ted, that Crabtree would accommodate
him with an hundred pieces out of his next remit|tance
from the country.</P>
<P>This demand galled and perplexed the old man
to &s;uch a degree, that the mu&s;cles of his face a&s;|&s;umed
a contraction mo&s;t peculiarly virulent, and
exhibited the character of Diogenes with a mo&s;t
lively expre&s;&s;ion: he knew that a confe&s;&s;ion of his
true &s;ituation would furni&s;h Pickle with an op|portunity
to make repri&s;als upon him, with in|tolerable
triumph; and that, by a downright re|fu&s;al
to &s;upply his wants, he would for ever for|feit
his friend&s;hip and e&s;teem, and might provoke
him to take ample vengeance for his fordid be|haviour,
by expo&s;ing him, in his native colours,
to the re&s;entment of tho&s;e whom he had &s;o long
deceived. The&s;e con&s;iderations kept him &s;ome
time in a mo&s;t rancorous &s;tate of &s;u&s;pence, which
Peregrine affected to mi&s;interpret, by bidding
him freely declare his &s;u&s;picion, if he did not think
it &s;afe to comply with his reque&s;t, and he would
make &s;hift el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>This &s;eeming mi&s;con&s;truction increa&s;ed the
torture of the mi&s;anthrope, who, with the ut|mo&s;t
irritation of feature, &startq;Oons! (cried he)
what villainy have you noted in my conduct, that
you treat me like a ra&s;cally u&s;urer?&endq; Peregrine
very gravely replied, that the que&s;tion needed no
<PB N="74" REF="80">
an&s;wer; &startq;for (&s;aid he) had I con&s;idered you as
an u&s;urer, I would have come with a &s;ecurity
under my arm; but, all eva&s;ion apart, will you
&s;tead me? will you plea&s;ure me? &s;hall I have the
money?&endq; &startq;Would it were in your belly, with
a barrel of gunpowder! (exclaimed the enraged
cynic) &s;ince I mu&s;t be excruciated, read that
plaguy paper!&mdash;'sblood! why didn't nature clap
a pair of long ears and a tail upon me, that I might
be a real a&s;s, and champ thi&s;tles on &s;ome com|mon,
independent of my fellow-creatures?
Would I were a worm, that I might creep into
the earth, and thatch my habitation with a &s;ingle
&s;traw; or rather a wa&s;p or a viper, that I might
make the ra&s;cally world feel my re&s;entment: but
why do I talk of ra&s;cality? folly, folly is the
&s;courge of life! Give me a &s;coundrel (&s;o he be a
&s;en&s;ible one) and I will put him in my heart of
hearts! but a fool is more mi&s;chievous than fa|mine,
pe&s;tilence and war. The idiotical h$g
that writes, or cau&s;es to be writ, this &s;ame let|ter,
has ruined her family, and broke her hus|band's
heart, by ignorance and mi&s;management;
and &s;he imputes her calamity to providence with
a vengeance; and &s;o I am defrauded of three
hundred pounds, the greate&s;t part of which I owe
to trade&s;men whom I have promi&s;ed to pay this
very quarter. Pox upon her! I would &s;he were
$n horned bea&s;t, that the di&s;temper might lay
hold on her. The beldame has the impudence
too (after &s;he has brought me into this dilemma)
to &s;olicit my a&s;&s;i&s;tance to &s;tock the farm anew&punc;
Before God, I have a good mind to &s;end her an
halter, and perhaps I might purcha&s;e another for
my&s;elf, but that I would not furni&s;h food for
laughter to knaves and coxcombs.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="81">
Peregrine having peru&s;ed the billet, and li&s;ten|ed
to this ejaculation, replied with great compo|&s;ure,
that he was a&s;hamed to &s;ee a man of his
years and preten&s;ions to philo&s;ophy, &s;o ruffled by
a trifle. &startq;What &s;ignify all the boa&s;ted hard&s;hips
you have overcome (&s;aid he) and the &s;hrewd ob|&s;ervations
you pretend to have made on human
nature? Where is that &s;toical indifference you
affirm you have attained, if &s;uch a paultry di&s;ap|pointment
can di&s;turb you in this manner? What
is the lo&s;s of three hundred pounds, compared
with the misfortunes which I my&s;elf have under|gone
within the&s;e two years? Yet you w$ll take
upon you to act the cen&s;or, and inveigh again&s;t
the impatience and impetuo&s;ity of youth, as if
you your&s;elf had gained an ab&s;olute conque&s;t $v$r
all the pa&s;&s;ions of the heart. You was &s;o kind as
to in&s;ult me t' other day in my affliction, by re|proaching
me with indi&s;cretion and mi&s;conduct;
&s;uppo&s;e I were now to retort the imputation, and
$word$ how a man of your profound &s;agacity could
leave your fortune at the di&s;cretion of ignorant
pea&s;ants? How could you be &s;o blind as not to
fore&s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of repairs, together with the
danger of a bankruptcy, murrain, or thin crop?
Why did not you convert your land into ready
money, and (as you have no connexions in life)
purcha&s;e an annuity, on which you might have
lived at your ea&s;e, without any fear of the con&s;e|quence?
Can't you, from the whole budget of
your philo&s;ophy, cull one apophthegm to con&s;$le
you in this trivial mi&s;chance?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Rot your rapidity! (&s;aid the cynic, half-choaked
with gall) if the cancer or the pox were
in your throat, I &s;hould not be thus tormented
with your tongue: and yet a magpye &s;hall &s;peak
<PB N="76" REF="82">
infinitely more to the purpo&s;e. Don't you know,
Mr. Wi&s;eacre, that my ca&s;e does not fall within
the province of philo&s;ophy? Had I been curtail|ed
of all my members, racked by the gout and
gravel, deprived of liberty, robbed of an only
child, or vi&s;ited with the death of a dear friend
like you, philo&s;ophy might have contributed to
my con&s;olation; but will philo&s;ophy pay my
debts, or free me from the burden of obligation
to a &s;et of fellows whom I de&s;pi&s;e? Speak&mdash;pro|nounce
&mdash;demon&s;trate&mdash;or may heaven clo&s;e your
mouth for ever!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The&s;e are the comfortable fruits of your
mi&s;anthropy (an&s;wered the youth) your laudable
&s;cheme of detaching your&s;elf from the bonds of
&s;ociety, and of moving in a &s;uperior &s;phere of
your own. Had not you been &s;o peculiarly &s;age,
and intent upon laughing at mankind, you could
never have been di&s;concerted by &s;uch a pitiful in|convenience:
any friend would have accommo|dated
you with the &s;um in que&s;tion. But now
the world may retort the laugh; for you &s;tand
upon &s;uch an agreeable footing with your ac|quaintance,
that nothing could plea&s;e them bet|ter
than an account of your having given di&s;ap|pointment
the &s;lip, by the help of a noo&s;e pro|perly
applied. This I mention by way of hint,
upon which I would have you chew the cud of
reflection; and &s;hould it come to that i&s;&s;ue, I
will u&s;e my whole intere&s;t with the coroner, to
bring in his verdict <HI>Lunacy,</HI> that your carca&s;e may
have chri&s;tian burial.&endq;</P>
<P>So &s;aying, he withdrew, very well &s;atisfied
with the revenge he had taken, which operated
&s;o violently upon Crabtree, that if it had not
been for the &s;ole con&s;ideration mentioned above,
<PB N="77" REF="83">
he would, in all probability, have had recour&s;e
to the remedy propo&s;ed. But his unwillingne&s;s
to oblige and entertain his fellow-creatures, hin|dered
him from practi&s;ing that expedient, till, by
cour&s;e of po&s;t, he was happily undeceived with
regard to the &s;ituation of his affairs; and that in|formation
had &s;uch an effect upon him, that he
not only forgave our hero for the &s;tratagem, which
he immediately a&s;cribed to the right author, but
al&s;o made him a tender of his pur&s;e: &s;o that mat|ters,
for the pre&s;ent, were brought to an amicable
accommodation.</P>
<P>Mean wh$le, Peregrine never &s;lackened in his
attendance upon the great; he never omitted to
appear upon every levee-day, employed his in|du&s;try
and penetration in getting intelligence of
po&s;ts that were unfilled, and every day recom|mended
him&s;elf to the good offices of his patron,
who &s;eemed to e&s;pou&s;e his intere&s;t with great cor|diality:
neverthele&s;s, he was always too late in
his application, or the place he demanded chanc|ed
to be out of the mini&s;ter's gift.</P>
<P>The&s;e intimations, tho' communicated in the
mo&s;t warm profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip and regard,
gave great umbrage to the young gentleman, who
con&s;idered them as the eva&s;ions of an in&s;incere
courtier, and loudly complained of them as &s;uch
to his lord&s;hip, &s;ignifying, at the &s;ame time, an
intention to &s;ell his mortgage for ready money,
which he would expend to the la&s;t farthing in
thwarting his honour, in the very fir&s;t election
he &s;hould patronize. His lord&s;hip never wanted
a proper exhortation upon the&s;e occa&s;ions: he
did not now endeavour to pacify him with a&s;|&s;urances
of the mini&s;ter's favour, becau&s;e he per|ceived
that the&s;e medicines had, by repeated u&s;e,
<PB N="78" REF="84">
lo&s;t their effect upon our adventurer, who&s;e me|naces
he now combated, by repre&s;enting that the
mini&s;ter's pur&s;e was heavier than that of Mr.
Pickle; that therefore, &s;hould he make a point
of oppo&s;ing his intere&s;t, the youth mu&s;t infallibly
fail in the conte&s;t: in which ca&s;e he would find
him&s;elf utterly de&s;titute of the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence,
and con&s;equently precluded from all hope
of provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>This was an ob&s;ervation, the truth of which
our young gentleman could not pretend to doubt,
tho' it did not at all tend to the vindication of
his honour's conduct. Indeed Pickle began to
&s;u&s;pect the &s;incerity of his own patron, who, in
his opinion, had trifled with his impatience, and
even eluded, by &s;orry excu&s;es, his de&s;ire of hav|ing
another private audience of the fir&s;t mover.
His lord&s;hip al&s;o began to be le&s;s acce&s;&s;ible than
u&s;ual; and Peregrine had been obliged to dun
the &s;teward with repeated demands, before he
could &s;inger the la&s;t quarter of his intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Alarmed by the&s;e con&s;iderations, he went and
con&s;ulted the nobleman whom he had obliged in
the affair of his &s;on; and had the mortification
to hear but a very indifferent character of the
per&s;on in whom he had &s;o long confided. This
new advi&s;er, who (though a courtier) was a rival
of the other, gave our adventurer to under&s;tand,
that he had been leaning upon a broken reed;
that his pro&s;e&s;&s;ed patron was a man of a &s;hat|tered
fortune and decayed intere&s;t, which ex|tended
no farther than a &s;mile and a whi&s;per;
that for his own part, he &s;hould have been proud
of an opportunity to u&s;e his influence with the
mini&s;ter in behalf of Mr. Pickle: &startq;But, &s;ince
you have put your&s;elf under the protection of
<PB N="79" REF="85">
another peer, (&s;aid he) who&s;e connexions inter|fere
with mine, I cannot now e&s;pou&s;e your
cau&s;e, without incurring the imputation of &s;e|ducing
that nobleman's adherents; a charge
which, of all others, I would mo&s;t carefully
avoid. However, I &s;hall always be ready to a&s;|&s;i&s;t
you with my private advice, as a &s;pecimen of
which, I now coun&s;el you to in&s;i&s;t upon having
another interview with Sir Steady Steerwell him|&s;elf,
that you may in per&s;on explain your preten|&s;ions,
without any ri&s;que of being mi&s;repre&s;ented;
and endeavour, if po&s;&s;ible, to draw him into &s;ome
particular promi&s;e, from which he cannot retract,
with any regard to his reputation: for general
profe&s;&s;ion is a nece&s;&s;ary armour worn by all mini|&s;ters
in their own defence, again&s;t the importu|nity
of tho&s;e whom they will not befriend, and
would not di&s;oblige.&endq;</P>
<P>This advice was &s;o conformable to his own
&s;entiments, that our adventurer &s;eized the fir&s;t
opportunity to demand an hearing; and plainly
told his patron, that if he could not be indulged
with that favour, he &s;hould look upon his lord|&s;hip's
influence to be very &s;mall, and his own
hopes to be altogether de&s;perate; in which ca&s;e,
he was re&s;olved to di&s;po&s;e of the mortgage, pur|cha&s;e
an annuity, and live independant.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. C.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">He is indulged with a &s;econd audience by the mi|ni&s;ter,
of who&s;e &s;incerity he is convinced. His
pride and ambition revive, and again are mor|tified.</HEAD>
<P>IF the young gentleman's money had been in
other hands, perhaps the peer would have
been at very little pains, either in gratifying his
demand, or oppo&s;ing his revenge; but he knew
that a &s;ale of the mortgage could not be effected
without an inquiry, to which he did not wi&s;h to
be expo&s;ed. He therefore employed all his in|tere&s;t
in procuring the &s;olicited audience; which
being granted, Peregrine, with great warmth
and elocution, expatiated upon the injury his
fortune had &s;uffered in the affair of the borough,
for which he had &s;tood candidate; he took notice
of the di&s;appointment he had &s;u&s;tained in the
other election, reminded him of the promi&s;es with
which he had been amu&s;ed, and in conclu&s;ion,
de&s;ired to know what he had to expect from his
favour.</P>
<P>The mini&s;ter having patiently heard him to an
end, replied with a mo&s;t gracious a&s;pect, that he
was very well informed of his merit and attach|ment,
and very much di&s;po&s;ed to convince him
of the regard which he paid to both; that till of
late, he did not know the nature of his expecta|tions,
neither had he the power of creating po&s;ts
for tho&s;e whom he was inclined to &s;erve; but if
Mr. Pickle would chalk out any fea&s;ible method,
by which he could manife&s;t his &s;entiments of
<PB N="81" REF="87">
friend&s;hip, he &s;hould not be backward in exe|cuting
the plan.</P>
<P>Peregrine laying hold on this declaration, men|tioned
&s;everal places which he knew to be vacant;
but the old eva&s;ion was &s;till u&s;ed: one of them
was not in his department of bu&s;ine&s;s; another
had been promi&s;ed to the third-&s;on of a certain
earl, before the death of the la&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; and
a third was incumbered with a pen&s;ion that ate
up a good half of the appointments. In &s;hort,
&s;uch ob&s;tructions were &s;tarted to all his propo&s;als,
as he could not po&s;&s;ibly &s;urmount; though he
plainly perceived, they were no other than &s;pe|cious
pretexts to cover the mortifying &s;ide of a
refu&s;al. Exa&s;perated, therefore, at this lack of
&s;incerity and gratitude, &startq;I can ea&s;ily fore&s;ee,
(&s;aid he) that &s;uch difficulties will never be want|ing,
when I have any thing to a&s;k; and for that
rea&s;on, will &s;ave my&s;elf the trouble of any far|ther
application.&endq; So &s;aying, he withdrew in a
very abrupt manner, breathing defiance and re|venge.
But his patron, who did not think pro|per
to drive him to extremities, found means to
per&s;uade his honour, to do &s;omething for the
pacification of the young man's choler: and that
&s;ame evening our adventurer received a me&s;&s;age
from his lord&s;hip, de&s;iring to &s;ee him imme|diately.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this intimation, Pickle went
to his hou&s;e, and appeared before him with a
very cloudy a&s;pect, which &s;ignified to whom it
might concern, that his temper was at pre&s;ent
too much galled to endure reproof; and there|fore
the &s;agacious peer forbore taking him to ta&s;k
for his behaviour during the audience he had ob|tained;
but gave him to under&s;tand, that the
<PB N="82" REF="88">
mini&s;ter, in con&s;ideration of his &s;ervices, h$d
&s;$nt him a bank-note for three hundred pounds,
with a promi&s;e of the like &s;um yearly, until he
could be otherwi&s;e provided for. This declara|tion
in &s;ome mea&s;ure appea&s;ed the youth, who
conde&s;cended to accept the pre&s;ent; and next
levee-day, made his acknowledgment to the do|nor,
who favoured him with a &s;mile of infinite
complacency, which intirely di&s;&s;ipated all the re|mains
of his re&s;entment; f$r, as he could not
po&s;&s;ibly divine the true cau&s;e of his being tem|porized
with, he looked upon his conde&s;cen&s;ion
as an undoubted proof of Sir Steady's &s;incerity,
and firmly believed, that he would &s;ettle him in
&s;ome place with the fir&s;t opportunity, rather than
continue to pay this pen&s;ion out of his own
pocket. In all probability, this prediction would
have been verified, had not an unfore&s;een acci|dent
in a moment overwhelmed the bark of his
intere&s;t at court.</P>
<P>Mean while, this &s;hort gleam of good fortune
recalled the ideas of pride and amb$$ion, which
he had formerly cheri&s;hed. His countenance
was again lifted up, his good humour $etrieve$,
and his mien re-exalted. Indeed, he began to be
con&s;idered as a ri&s;ing man by his fellow-depen|dants,
who &s;aw the particular notice with which
he was favoured at the public levee; and &s;ome of
them, for that rea&s;on, were at pains to court his
good graces. He no longer &s;hunned his former
intimates, with whom a good part of his fortune
had been &s;pent, but made up to them in all places
of public re&s;ort, with the &s;ame ca&s;e and fami|liarity
as he had been u&s;ed to expre&s;s, and even
reimbarked in &s;ome of their exce&s;&s;es, upon the
&s;trength of his &s;anguine expectation. Cadwallader

North of their di&s;plea&s;ure.</HI></P>
<P>But the&s;e enjoyments were &s;oon interrupted by
$ misfortune equally fatal and unexpected: his
noble patron was &s;eized with an apoplectic fit,
from which he was recovered by the phy&s;cians,
that they might di&s;patch him according to rule;
and accordingly, in two months after they were
called, he went the way of all fle&s;h. Peregrine
was very much afflicted at this event, not only
on account of his friend&s;hip for the decea&s;ed, to
whom he thought him&s;elf under many and great
obligations, but al&s;o, becau&s;e he feared that his
own intere&s;t would &s;uffer a &s;evere &s;hock, by the
removal of this nobleman, whom he con&s;idered
as its chief &s;upport. He put him&s;elf therefore in
mourning, out of regard to the memory of his
departed friend, and exhibited genuine marks of
&s;orrow and concern; though he had, in reality,
more cau&s;e to grieve than he as yet imagined.</P>
<P>When quarter day came about, he applied to
the &s;teward of his lord&s;hip's heir for the intere&s;t
of his money, as u&s;ual; and the reader will rea|dily
own he had &s;ome rea&s;on to be &s;urprized,
when he was told he had no claim either to prin|cipal
or intere&s;t. True it is, the manager talked
very civilly as well as &s;en&s;ibly on the &s;ubject.
&startq;Your appearance, Sir, (&s;aid he to Pickle)
&s;creens you from all &s;u&s;picion of an intended
fraud; but the mortgage upon tho&s;e lands you
mention, was granted to another per&s;on many
years before you pretend to have lent that &s;um;
and I have, this very morning, paid one quar|ter's
<PB N="84" REF="90">
intere&s;t, as appears from this receipt, which
you may peru&s;e for your &s;atisfaction.&endq;</P>
<P>Peregrine was &s;o thunder-&s;truck at this infor|mation,
which &s;tripped him of his all, that he
could not utter one word; a circum&s;tance that
did no great honour to his character, in the opi|nion
of the &s;teward, who, in good earne&s;t, be|gan
to entertain &s;ome doubts of his integrity:
for, among the papers of the decea&s;ed, which he
had examined, there was no writing, memo|randum,
or receipt, relating to this incumbrance.
After a long pau&s;e of &s;tupefaction, Peregrine re|collected
him&s;elf &s;o far, as to ob&s;erve, that either
he was egregiou&s;ly mi&s;taken, or the predece&s;&s;or
of his lord the greate&s;t villain upon earth. &startq;But,
Mr. Whatdyecallum, (&s;aid he) you mu&s;t give
me leave to tell you, that your bare a&s;&s;ertion, in
this affair, will by no means induce me to put
up quietly with the lo&s;s of ten thou&s;and pounds.&endq;</P>
<P>Having thus expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, he retired from
the hou&s;e, &s;o di&s;contented at this demur, that he
&s;carce knew whether he moved upon his head or
heels; and the park chancing to lie in his way,
he &s;auntered about, giving vent to a &s;oliloquy in
prai&s;e of his departed friend, the burden of which
was a &s;tring of incoherent cur&s;es imprecated upon
him&s;elf; till his tran&s;ports, by degrees, giving
way to his reflection, he deliberated &s;eriou&s;ly
and &s;orrowfully upon his misfortune, and re&s;olved
to con&s;ult lawyers, without lo&s;s of time. But,
fir&s;t of all, he propo&s;ed to make per&s;onal appli|cation
to the heir, who, by a candid repre&s;en|tation
of the ca&s;e, might be inclined to do him
ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this determination, he next
morning put his writings in his pocket, and went
<PB N="85" REF="91">
in a chair to the hou&s;e of the young nobleman,
to whom being admitted by virtue of his appear|ance,
and a &s;mall gratification to the porter, he
explained the whole affair, corroborating his a&s;&s;er|tions
with the papers which he produced, and
de&s;cribing the di&s;grace that would be intailed upon
the memory of the decea&s;ed, &s;hould he be obliged
to &s;eek redre&s;s in a public court of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The executor, who was a per&s;on of good
breeding, condoled him upon his lo&s;s with great
good nature, though he did not &s;eem much &s;ur|prized
at his account of the matter; but wi&s;hed,
that &s;ince the fraud mu&s;t have been committed,
the damage had fallen upon the fir&s;t mortgager,
who (he &s;aid) was a thievi&s;h u&s;urer, grown rich
by the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of his fellow-creatures. In an|&s;wer
to our hero's remon&s;trances, he ob&s;erved,
that he did not look upon him&s;elf as obliged to
pay the lea&s;t regard to the character of his pre|dece&s;&s;or,
who had u&s;ed him with great barbarity
and inju&s;tice, not only in excluding him from
his countenance and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but al&s;o in preju|dicing
his inheritance, as much as lay in his
power; &s;o that it could not be rea&s;onably ex|pected,
that he would pay ten thou&s;and pounds
of his debt, for which he had received no value.
Peregrine, in &s;pite of his chagrin, could not help
owning within him&s;elf, that there was a good
deal of rea&s;on in this refu&s;al; and after having
given loo&s;e to his indignation, in the mo&s;t vio|lent
invectives again&s;t the defunct, took his leave
of the complai&s;ant heir, and had immediate re|cour&s;e
to the advice of coun&s;el, who a&s;&s;ured him
that he had an excellent plea, and was accordingly
retained in the cau&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="92">
All the&s;e mea&s;ures were taken in the fir&s;t vi|gour
of his exertion, during which his &s;pirits were
&s;o flu&s;tered with the diver&s;ity of pa&s;&s;ions produced
by his mi&s;chance, that he mi&s;took for equanimity
that which was no other than intoxication; and
two whole days elap&s;ed, before he arrived at a
due &s;en&s;e of his misfortune. Then indeed he
underwent a woeful &s;elf-examination; every cir|cum&s;tance
of the inquiry added fre&s;h pangs to his
reflection; and the re&s;ult of the whole was a
di&s;covery, that his fortune was totally con&s;umed,
and him&s;elf reduced to a &s;tate of the mo&s;t de|plorable
dependance. This &s;ugge&s;tion alone
might (in the angui&s;h of his de&s;pondency) have
driven him to &s;ome de&s;perate cour&s;e, had not it
been in &s;ome mea&s;ure qualified by the confidence
of his lawyers, and the a&s;&s;urance of the mini&s;ter,
which (&s;lender as the world hath generally found
them) were the only bulwarks between mi&s;ery
and him.</P>
<P>The mind is naturally pliable, and, provided
it has the lea&s;t hope to lean upon, adapts it&s;elf
wonderfully to the emergencies of fortune, e&s;pe|cially
when the imagination is gay and luxuriant.
This was the ca&s;e with our adventurer; in&s;tead
of indulging the melancholy ideas which his lo&s;s
in&s;pired, he had recour&s;e to the flattering delu|&s;ions
of hope, &s;oothing him&s;elf with un&s;ub&s;tan|tial
plans of future greatne&s;s, and endeavouring
to cover what was pa&s;t with the veil of oblivion.</P>
<P>After &s;ome he&s;itation, he re&s;olved to make
Crabtree acquainted with his misfortune, that
once for all he might might pa&s;s the ordeal of
his &s;atire, without &s;ubjecting him&s;elf to a long
&s;eries of &s;arca&s;tic hints and doubtful allu&s;ions,
which he could not endure. He accordingly
<PB N="87" REF="93">
took the fir&s;t opportunity of telling him, that he
was ab&s;olutely ruined by the per&s;idy of his pa|tron,
and de&s;ired that he would not aggravate
his affliction, by tho&s;e cynical remarks which were
peculiar to men of his mi&s;anthropical di&s;po&s;ition.
Cadwallader li&s;tened to this declaration with in|ternal
&s;urprize, which, however, produced no
alteration in his countenance; and, after &s;ome
pau&s;e, ob&s;erved, that our hero had no rea&s;on to
look for any new ob&s;ervation from him upon
this event, which he had long fore&s;een, and daily
expected; and exhorted him, with an ironical
$word$, to con&s;ole him&s;elf with the promi&s;e of the
mini&s;ter, who would doubtle&s;s di&s;charge the debts
of his decea&s;ed bo&s;om-friend.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Peregrine commits him&s;elf to the publick, and is
admitted member of a college of authors.</HEAD>
<P>THE bitterne&s;s of this explanation being
pa&s;&s;ed, our young gentleman began to re|volve
within him&s;elf &s;chemes for making up the
deficiencies of his yearly income, which was now
&s;o grievou&s;ly reduced, and determined to profit,
in &s;ome &s;hape or other, by tho&s;e talents which he
owed to nature and education. He had, in his
affluence, heard of &s;everal authors, who, with|out
any preten&s;ions to genius, or human litera|ture,
earned a very genteel &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, by un|dertaking
work for book&s;ellers, in which reputa|tion
was not at all concerned. One (for ex|ample)
profe&s;&s;ed all manner of tran&s;lation, at &s;o
much <HI>per</HI> &s;heet, and actually kept five or &s;ix
amanuen&s;es continually employed, like &s;o many
<PB N="88" REF="94">
clerks in a compting-hou&s;e; by which means,
he was enabled to live at his ea&s;e, and enjoy his
friend and his bottle, ambitious of no other cha|racter
than that of an hone&s;t man, and a good
neighbour. Another projected a variety of plans
for new dictionaries, which were executed under
his eye by day-labourers; and the province of a
third was hi&s;tory and voyages, collected or abridged
by under&s;trappers of the &s;ame cla&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. Pickle, in his compari&s;ons, paid &s;uch de|ference
to his own capacity, as bani&s;hed all
doubts of his being able to excel any of tho&s;e un|dertakers,
in their different branches of profe&s;|&s;ion,
if ever he &s;hould be driven to that experi|ment:
but his ambition prompted him to make
his intere&s;t and glory coincide, by attempting
&s;ome performance which &s;hould do him honour
with the publick, and at the &s;ame time e&s;tabli&s;h
his importance among the copy-purcha&s;ers in
town. With this view, he wor&s;hipped the mu&s;e;
and, con&s;cious of the little regard which is, in
this age, paid to every &s;pecies of poetic compo|&s;ition,
in which neither &s;atire nor ob&s;cenity oc|curs,
he produced an imitation of Juvenal, and
la&s;hed &s;ome con&s;picuous characters, with equal
truth, &s;pirit, and &s;everity. Though his name
did not appear in the title-page of this produc|tion,
he managed matters &s;o, as that the work
was univer&s;ally imputed to the true author, who
was not altogether di&s;appointed in his expecta|tions
of &s;ucce&s;s; for the impre&s;&s;ion was imme|diately
&s;old off, and the piece became the &s;ub|ject
of conver&s;ation in all a&s;&s;emblies of ta&s;te.</P>
<P>This happy exordium not only attracted the
addre&s;&s;es of the book&s;ellers, who made intere&s;t
for his acquaintance, but al&s;o rou&s;ed the notice
<PB N="89" REF="95">
of a &s;ociety of authors, who &s;tiled them&s;elves
<HI>the college,</HI> from which he was honoured with a
deputation, offering to enroll him a member, by
unanimous con&s;ent. The per&s;on employed for
this purpo&s;e being a bard who had formerly ta&s;ted
of our hero's bounty, u&s;ed all his eloquence to
per&s;uade him to comply with the advances of
their fraternity, which he de&s;cribed in &s;uch a
manner, as inflamed the curio&s;ity of Pickle, who
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the emba&s;&s;ador, with an acknowledge|ment
of the great honour they conferred upon
him, and a faithful promi&s;e of endeavouring to
merit the continuance of their approbation.</P>
<P>He was afterwards, by the &s;ame mini&s;ter, in|&s;tructed
in the ceremonies of the college; and,
in con&s;equence of his information, compo&s;ed an
ode, to be publickly recited on the evening of his
introduction. He under&s;tood, that this con&s;ti|tution
was no other than a body of authors, in|corporated
by mutual con&s;ent, for their joint ad|vantage
and &s;atisfaction, oppo&s;ed to another a&s;|&s;embly
of the &s;ame kind, their avowed enemies
and detractors. No wonder then, that they
&s;ought to &s;trengthen them&s;elves with &s;uch a va|luable
acqui&s;ition as our hero was like to prove.
The college con&s;i&s;ted of authors only, and the&s;e
of all degrees in point of reputation, from the
fabricator of a &s;ong &s;et to mu&s;ic, and &s;ung at
Marybone, to the dramatic bard who had ap|peared
in bu&s;kins upon the &s;tage: nay, one of
the members had actually fini&s;hed eight books of
an epic poem, for the publication of which, he
was, at that time, &s;oliciting &s;ub&s;criptions.</P>
<P>It cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;uch a congregation
of the &s;ons of Apollo would &s;it a whole evening
with order and decorum, unle&s;s they were under
<PB N="90" REF="96">
the check of &s;ome e&s;tabli&s;hed authority: and this
inconvenience having been fore&s;een, they had
elected a pre&s;ident, ve&s;ted with full power to &s;i|lence
any member or members, that &s;hould at|tempt
to di&s;turb the harmony and &s;ubordination
of the whole. The &s;age, who at this time po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
the chair, was a per&s;on in years, who&s;e
countenance was a lively portraiture of that ran|corous
di&s;content which follows repeated dam|nation.
He had been extremely unfortunate in
his theatrical productions, and was (to u&s;e the
words of a prophane wag, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the
condemnation of his la&s;t play) by this time <HI>damn'd
beyond redemption.</HI> Neverthele&s;s, he &s;till tarried
about the &s;kirts of Parna&s;&s;us, tran&s;lating &s;ome of
the cla&s;&s;ics, and writing mi&s;cellanies; and, by
dint of an invincible a&s;&s;urance, in&s;olence untamed,
the mo&s;t undaunted virulence of tongue, and
&s;ome knowledge of life, he made &s;hift to ac|quire
and maintain the character of a man of
learning and wit, in the opinion of people who
had neither; that is, thirty-nine in forty of tho&s;e
with whom he a&s;&s;ociated him&s;elf. He was even
looked upon in this light by &s;ome few of the col|lege;
though the major part of tho&s;e who fa|voured
his election, were &s;uch as dreaded his ma|lice,
re&s;pected his experience and &s;eniority, or
hated his competitor, who was the epic poet.</P>
<P>The chief end of this &s;ociety (as I have al|ready
hinted) was to a&s;&s;i&s;t and &s;upport each other
in their productions, which they mutually recom|mended
to &s;ale, with all their art and influence,
not only in private conver&s;ation, but al&s;o in oc|ca&s;ional
epigrams, critici&s;ms, and adverti&s;ements
in&s;erted in the public papers. This &s;cience,
which is known by the vulgar appellation or
<PB N="91" REF="97">
<HI>puffing,</HI> they carried to &s;uch a pitch of fine&s;&s;e,
that an author very often wrote an abu&s;ive an|&s;wer
to his own performance, in order to inflame
the curio&s;ity of the town, by which it had been
overlook'd. Notwith&s;tanding this general unani|mity
in the college, a private animo&s;ity had long
&s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the two rivals I have mention|ed,
on account of precedence, to which both
laid claim, though, by a majority of votes, it
had been decided in favour of the pre&s;ent chair|man.
The grudge indeed never proceeded to
any degree of outrage or defiance, but manife&s;ted
it&s;elf at every meeting, in attempts to eclip&s;e each
other in &s;mart &s;ayings and pregnant repartee; &s;o
that there was always a delicate me&s;s of this kind
of wit &s;erved up in the front of the evening, for
the entertainment and example of the junior
members, who never failed to divide upon this
occa&s;ion, declaring them&s;elves for one or other of
the combatants, whom they encouraged by their
looks, ge&s;tures, and applau&s;e, according to the
circum&s;tances of the di&s;pute.</P>
<P>This honourable con&s;i&s;tory was held in the
be&s;t room of an ale-hou&s;e, which afforded wine,
punch, or beer, &s;uitable to the pur&s;e or inclina|tion
of every individual, who &s;eparately paid for
his own choice: and here was our hero intro|duced,
in the mid&s;t of twenty &s;trangers, who, by
their looks and equipage, formed a very pic|ture&s;que
variety. He was received with a mo&s;t
gracious &s;olemnity, and placed upon the right
hand of the pre&s;ident, who having commanded
&s;ilence, recited aloud his introductory ode, which
met with univer&s;al approbation. Then was
tendered to him the cu&s;tomary oath, obliging
him to con&s;ult the honour and advantage of the
<PB N="92" REF="98">
&s;ociety, as far as it &s;hould lie in his power, in
every &s;tation of life: and this being taken, his
temples were bound with a wreath of laurel,
which was kept &s;acred for &s;uch inauguration.</P>
<P>When the&s;e rites were performed with all due
ceremony, the new member ca&s;t his eyes around
the place, and took a more accurate &s;urvey of his
brethren; among whom he ob&s;erved a &s;trange
collection of periwigs, with regard to the co|lour,
fa&s;hion, and dimen&s;ions, which were &s;uch
as he had never &s;een before. Tho&s;e who &s;at on
each &s;ide, neare&s;t the pre&s;ident, were generally
di&s;tingui&s;hed by venerable tyes, the foretops of
which exhibited a &s;urpri&s;ing diver&s;ity; &s;ome of
them ro&s;e &s;lanting backwards, like the glacis of
a fortification; &s;ome were elevated in two di|&s;tinct
eminences, like the hills H$licon and Par|na&s;&s;us;
and others were curled and reflected, as
the horns of Jupiter Ammon. Next to the&s;e,
the majors took place, many of which were mere
<HI>&s;uccedanea,</HI> made by the application of an occa|&s;ional
ro&s;e to the tail of a lank bob; and in the
lower form appeared ma&s;&s;es of hair, which would
admit of no de&s;cription.</P>
<P>Their cloaths were tolerably well &s;uited to
the furniture of their heads, the apparel of the
upper bench being decent and clean, while that
of the &s;econd cla&s;s was thread-bare and &s;oiled;
and at the lower end of the room, he perceived
divers efforts made to conceal rent breeches and
dirty linen: nay, he could di&s;tingui&s;h by their
countenances, the different kinds of poetry in
which they exerci&s;ed the mu&s;e; he &s;aw Tragedy
con&s;picuous in a grave &s;olemnity of regard, Satire
louring in a frown of envy and di&s;content, Elegy
whining in a funereal a&s;pect, Pa&s;toral dozing in
<PB N="93" REF="99">
a mo&s;t in&s;ipid languor of face, Ode-writing deli|neated
in a di&s;tracted &s;tare, and Epigram &s;quint|ing
with a pert &s;neer. Perhaps our hero refined
too much in his penetration, when he affirmed,
that over and above the&s;e di&s;coveries, he could
plainly perceive the &s;tate of every one's finances,
and would have undertaken to have gue&s;&s;ed each
particular &s;um, without varying three farthings
from the truth.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation, in&s;tead of becoming ge|neral,
began to fall into parties; and the epic
poet had actually attracted the attention of a pri|vate
committee, when the chairman interpo&s;ed,
calling aloud, &startq;No cabals, no con&s;piracies, gen|tlemen.&endq;
His rival, thinking it incumbent upon
him to make &s;ome reply to this rebuke, an&s;wer|ed,
&startq;We have no &s;ecrets; he that hath ears,
let him hear.&endq; This was &s;poke as an intimation
to the company, who&s;e looks were in&s;tantly
whetted with the expectation of their ordinary
meal: but the pre&s;ident &s;eemed to decline the
conte&s;t; for, without putting on his fighting face,
he calmly replied, that he had &s;een Mr. Meta|phor
tip the wink, and whi&s;per to one of his con|federates;
and thence judged, that there was
&s;omething my&s;terious on the carpet.</P>
<P>The epic poet, believing his antagoni&s;t cre&s;t|fallen,
re&s;olved to take the advantage of his de|jection,
that he might inhance his own character
in the opinion of the &s;tranger; and with that
view a&s;ked, with an air of exultation, if a man
might not be allowed to have a convul&s;ion in his
eye, without being &s;u&s;pected of a con&s;piracy.
The pre&s;ident, perceiving his drift, and piqued
at his pre&s;umption, &startq;To be &s;ure (&s;aid he) a
man of a weak head may be very well &s;uppo&s;ed
<PB N="94" REF="100">
to have convul&s;ions in his eyes.&endq; This repartee
produced a laugh of triumph among the chair|man's
adherents; one of whom ob&s;erved, that
his rival had got a &s;mart rap on the pate. &startq;Yes,
(replied the bard) in that re&s;pect Mr. Chairman
has the advantage of me. Had my head been
fortified with a horn-work, I &s;hould not have
been &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the &s;troke.&endq; This retort,
which carried a &s;evere allu&s;ion to the pre&s;ident's
wife, lighted up the countenances of the aggre&s;|&s;or's
friends, which had begun to be a little ob|umbrated;
and had a contrary effect upon the
other faction, till their chief, collecting all his
capacity, returned the &s;alute, by ob&s;erving, that
there was no occa&s;ion for an horn-work, when
the covered way was not worth defending.</P>
<P>Such a reprizal upon Mr. Metaphor's yoke|fellow,
who was by no means remarkable for her
beauty, could not fail to operate upon the hearers;
and as for the bard him&s;elf, he was evidently
ruffled by the reflection; to which, however, he,
without he&s;itation, replied, &startq;Egad! 'tis my opi|nion,
that if your covered way was laid open,
few people would venture to give the a&s;&s;ault.&endq;
&startq;Not unle&s;s their batteries were more effectual
than the fire of your wit,&endq; (&s;aid the pre&s;ident.)
&startq;As for that matter, (cried the other with pre|cipitation)
they would have no occa&s;ion to batter
in breach; they would find the angle of the <HI>la
pucelle</HI> ba&s;tion demoli&s;hed to their hands: he he!&endq;
&startq;But I believe it would &s;urpa&s;s your under|&s;tanding,
(re&s;umed the chairman) to fill up the
<HI>fo&s;$e.&endq;</HI> &startq;That, I own, is impracticable, (replied
the bard) there I &s;hould meet with an <HI>hiatus
maxime deflendus!&endq;</HI></P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="101">
The pre&s;ident, exa&s;perated at this in&s;inuation,
in pre&s;ence of the new member, exclaimed with
indignation in his looks, &startq;And yet, if a body
of pioneers were &s;et at work upon your &s;kull,
they would find rubbi&s;h enough to choak up all
the common &s;ewers in town.&endq; Here a groan
was uttered by the admirers of the epic poet,
who taking a pinch of &s;nuff with great compo|&s;ure,
&startq;When a man grows &s;currilous, (&s;aid he)
I take it for an undoubted proof of his over|throw.&endq;
&startq;If that be the ca&s;e, (cried the other)
you your&s;elf mu&s;t be the vanqui&s;hed party; for
you was the fir&s;t that was driven to per&s;onal
abu&s;e.&endq; &startq;I appeal (an&s;wered the bard) to
tho&s;e who can di&s;tingui&s;h. Gentlemen, your
judgment?&endq;</P>
<P>This reference produced an univer&s;al clamour,
and the whole college was involved in confu&s;ion.
Every man entered into di&s;pute with his neigh|bour,
on the merits of this cau&s;e. The chair|man
interpo&s;ed his authority in vain; the noi&s;e
grew louder and louder; the di&s;putants waxed
warm; the epithets of <HI>blockhead, fool,</HI> and <HI>&s;coundrel</HI>
were bandied about. Peregrine enjoyed the up|roar,
and leaping upon the table, founded the
charge to battle, which was immediately com|menced
in ten different duels; in con&s;equence of
which, the lights were extingui&s;hed; the com|batants
thre&s;hed one another without di&s;tinction;
the mi&s;chievous Pickle di&s;tributed &s;undry random
blows in the dark; and the people below, being
alarmed with the &s;ound of application, the over|turning
of chairs, and the outcries of tho&s;e who
were engaged, came up &s;tairs in a body, wi$h
lights, to reconnoitre, and, if po&s;&s;ible, quell this
hideous tumult.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="102">
Objects were no &s;ooner rendered vi&s;ible, than
the field of battle exhibited &s;trange groupes of
the &s;tanding and the fallen. Each of Mr. Me|taphor's
eyes was &s;urrounded with a circle of a
livid hue; and the pre&s;ident's no&s;e di&s;tilled a
quantity of clotted blood. One of the tragic
authors, finding him&s;elf a&s;&s;aulted in the dark,
had, by way of poinard, employed upon his ad|ver&s;ary's
throat a knife which lay upon the table,
for the convenience of cutting chee&s;e; but, by
the ble&s;&s;ing of God, the edge of it was not keen
enough to enter the &s;kin, which it had only
&s;cratched in divers places. A &s;atiri&s;t had almo&s;t
bit off the ear of a lyric bard. Shirts and neck-cloaths
were torn to rags; and there was &s;uch a
woeful wreck of periwigs on the floor, that no
examination could adju&s;t the property of the own|ers,
the greate&s;t part of whom were obliged to
u&s;e handkerchiefs, by way of night-cap.</P>
<P>The fray, however, cea&s;ed at the approach of
tho&s;e who interpo&s;ed; part of the combatants
being tired of an exerci&s;e, in which they had re|ceived
nothing but hard blows; part of them be|ing
intimidated by the remon&s;trances of the land|lord
and his company, who threatened to call
the watch; and a very few being a&s;hamed of the
&s;candalous di&s;pute in which they were detected.
But though the battle was ended, it was impo&s;|&s;ible,
for that evening, to re&s;tore harmony and
good order to the &s;ociety, which broke up, after
the pre&s;ident had pronounced a &s;hort and con|fu&s;ed
apology to our adventurer, for the indecent
uproar which had unfortunately happened on the
fir&s;t night of his admi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Indeed, Peregrine deliberated with him&s;elf,
whether or not his reputation would allow him
<PB N="97" REF="103">
to appear again among this venerable fraternity:
but, as he knew &s;ome of them to be men of real
genius, how ridiculous &s;oever their carriage might
be modified, and was of that laughing di&s;po&s;ition,
which is always &s;eeking food for mirth, as Horace
ob&s;erves of Philippus,
<Q>Ri&s;us undique quaerit;</Q>
he re&s;olved to frequent the college, notwith&s;tand|ing
this accident, which happened at his inaugu|ration;
being thereto, moreover, induced by his
de&s;ire of knowing the private hi&s;tory of the &s;tage,
with which he &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ome of the members
perfectly well acquainted. He was al&s;o vi&s;ited,
before the next meeting, by his introductor, who
a&s;&s;ured him, that &s;uch a tumult had never hap|pened
&s;ince the in&s;titution of the a&s;&s;embly, till
that very night; and promi&s;ed, that for the fu|ture,
he &s;hould have no cau&s;e to be &s;candalized
at their behaviour.</P>
<P>Per&s;uaded by the&s;e motives and a&s;&s;urances, he
tru&s;ted him&s;elf once more in the mid&s;t of their
community, and every thing proceeded with great
decorum; all di&s;pute and altercation was avoided,
and the college applied it&s;elf &s;eriou&s;ly to the pur|po&s;es
of its meeting; namely, to hear the grie|vances
of individuals, and a&s;&s;i&s;t them with &s;alu|tary
advice. The fir&s;t per&s;on that craved redre&s;s,
was a noi&s;y North Briton, who complained (in a
&s;trange dialect) that he had, in the beginning of
the &s;ea&s;on, pre&s;ented a comedy to the manager
of a certain theatre, who, after it had lain &s;ix
weeks in his hands, returned it to the author, af|firming
there was neither &s;en&s;e nor Engli&s;h in the
performance.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="104">
The pre&s;ident, (who, by the bye) had revi&s;ed
the piece) thinking his own reputation concern|ed,
declared, in pre&s;ence of the whole &s;ociety,
that with regard to &s;en&s;e, he would not under|take
to vindicate the production; but, in point
of language, no fault could be ju&s;tly laid to its
charge: &startq;The ca&s;e, however, is very plain,
(&s;aid he) the manager never gave him&s;elf the
trouble to peru&s;e the play, but formed a judgment
of it from the conver&s;ation of the author, never
dreaming that it had undergone the revi&s;al of an
Engli&s;h writer: be that as it will, you are infi|nitely
obliged to him, for having di&s;patched you
&s;o &s;oon, and I &s;hall have the better opinion of him
for it &s;o long as I live; for I have known other-gue&s;s
authors than you (that is, in point of in|tere&s;t
and fame) kept in continual attendance
and dependance during the be&s;t part of their lives,
and after all, di&s;appointed in the expectation of
&s;eeing their performances exhibited on the &s;tage.
There are only two methods, by which you have
any chance of introducing your play upon the
theatre; one is compul&s;ive, by the interpo|&s;ition
of the great, whom a patentee dares not
di&s;oblige; the other, in&s;inuation, by ingratiating
your&s;elf with the manager: you mu&s;t be recom|mended
to his notice; you mu&s;t cultivate his
good graces with all the humility of adulation;
write poems in his prai&s;e; if he be an actor, &s;up|port
his performance again&s;t all cen&s;ure, though
it &s;hould be founded upon demon&s;tration; and in
public coffee-hou&s;es, as well as in private parties,
magnify the virtues of his heart, in de&s;pite of
truth and illu&s;tration. This, indeed, is the mo&s;t
effectual expedient, and what I advi&s;e you to
practi&s;e, after you &s;hall have been introduced to
<PB N="99" REF="105">
his acquaintance, by &s;ome per&s;on of weight; and
if, by the&s;e means, and dint of per&s;everance,
you can, in three or four years, &s;ee your comedy
in rehear&s;al, you may think your&s;elf extremely
fortunate in your application: for a man, with|out
intere&s;t or preten&s;ion, may pre&s;ent a petition
to the captain-general of his maje&s;ty's forces,
demanding a commi&s;&s;ion for the fir&s;t company
that &s;hall become vacant, and be as likely to
meet with &s;ucce&s;s, as an un&s;upported author that
offers a performance to the &s;tage. Though a
patentee had no friends of his own to oblige,
why the devil &s;hould he put him&s;elf to the ex|pence
and trouble attending the repre&s;entation of
a new play, and part with three benefit-nights,
to plea&s;e the vanity and fill the pockets of a
&s;tranger?&endq;</P>
<P>The northern bard began to argue with great
vehemence and vociferation, again&s;t the advice
and ob&s;ervations of the chairman, undertaking to
prove from rea&s;on, as well as from experience,
that one poet is of greater dignity and importance
to the commonwealth, than all the patentees or
players that ever exi&s;ted. But he was over-ruled
and &s;ilenced in the beginning of his harangue, by
a decree of the council, which was unanimou&s;ly
of opinion, that the advice he had received was
equally judicious and expedient, and that it would
be his own fault, if he did not profit by the ad|monition.</P>

<P>THIS affair was no &s;ooner di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, than
another gentleman exhibited a complaint,
&s;ignifying, that he had undertaken to tran&s;late in|to
Engli&s;h, a certain celebrated author, who had
been cruelly mangled by former attempts; and
that, &s;oon as his de&s;ign took air, the proprietors
of tho&s;e mi&s;erable tran&s;lations had endeavoured
to prejudice his work, by indu&s;trious in&s;inuations,
contrary to truth and fair dealing, importing,
that he did not under&s;tand one word of the lan|guage
which he pretended to tran&s;late. This
being a ca&s;e that nearly concerned the greate&s;t
part of the audience, it was taken into &s;erious
deliberation: &s;ome ob&s;erved, that it was not only
a malicious effort again&s;t the plaintiff, but al&s;o a
&s;piteful adverti&s;ement to the public, tending to
promote an inquiry into the abilities of all other
tran&s;lators, few of whom (it was well known)
were &s;o qualified, as to &s;tand the te&s;t of &s;uch ex|amination.
Others &s;aid, that over and above
th$s con&s;ideration, which ought to have its due
weight with the college, there was a nece&s;&s;ity
for concerting mea&s;ures to humble the pre&s;ump|tion
of book&s;ellers, who had, from time imme|morial,
taken all opportunities to oppre&s;s and en|&s;lave
their authors; not only by limiting men of
genius to the wages of a journeyman taylor,
without even allowing them one &s;abbath in the
week, but al&s;o in taking &s;uch advantages of their
nece&s;&s;ities, as were incon&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice and
humanity, &startq;For example, (&s;aid one of the
<PB N="101" REF="107">
members) after I my&s;elf had acquired a little re|putation
with the town, I was care&s;&s;ed by one of
tho&s;e tyrants who profe&s;&s;ed a friend&s;hip for me,
and even &s;uppl$ed me with money, according to
the exigencies of my &s;ituation; &s;o that I looked
upon him as the mirrour of di&s;intere&s;ted benevo|lence;
and had he known my di&s;po&s;ition, and
treated me accordingly, I &s;hould have writ for
him upon his own terms. After I had u&s;ed his
friend&s;hip in this manner for &s;ome time, I hap|pened
to have occa&s;ion for a &s;mall &s;um of money,
and with great confidence made another applica|tion
to my good friend; when all of a &s;udden he
put a &s;top to his genero&s;ity, refu&s;ed to accom|modate
me in the mo&s;t abrupt and mortifying
&s;tyle; and though I was at that time pretty far
advanced in a work for his benefit, which was
a &s;ufficient &s;ecurity for what I owed him, he
roundly a&s;ked, how I propo&s;ed to pay the money
which I had already borrowed. Thus was I
u&s;ed like a young whore ju&s;t come upon the
town, whom the bawd allows to run into her
debt, that &s;he may have it in her power to op|pre&s;s
her at plea&s;ure; and if the &s;ufferer com|plains,
&s;he is treated like the mo&s;t ungrateful
wretch upon earth; and that too with &s;uch appear|ance
of rea&s;on, as may ea&s;ily mi&s;lead an uncon|cerned
&s;pectator. &startq;You unthankful drab! (&s;he
will &s;ay) didn't I take you into my hou&s;e when
you hadn't a &s;hift to your back, a petticoat to
your tail, nor a mor&s;el of bread to put into your
belly? Ha'n't I cloathed you from head to foot
like a gentlewoman, &s;upported you with board,
lodging, and all nece&s;&s;aries, till your own ex|travagance
hath brought you into di&s;tre&s;s; and
now you have the impudence, you na&s;ty, &s;tinking
<PB N="102" REF="108">
brim&s;tone bungaway! to &s;ay you are hardly dealt
with, when I demand no more than my own.&endq;
Thus the whore and the author are equally op|pre&s;&s;ed,
and even left without the melancholy
privilege of complaining; &s;o that they are fain to
&s;ub&s;cribe to &s;uch terms as their creditors &s;hall
plea&s;e to impo&s;e.</P>
<P>This illu&s;tration operated &s;o powerfully upon
the conviction and re&s;entment of the whole col|lege,
that revenge was univer&s;ally denounced
again&s;t tho&s;e who had aggrieved the plaintiff; and
after &s;ome debate, it was agreed, that he &s;hould
make a new tran&s;lation of &s;ome other &s;aleable
book, in oppo&s;ition to a former ver&s;ion belonging
to the delinquents, and print it in &s;uch a &s;mall
&s;ize, as would enable him to under&s;ell their pro|perty;
and that this new tran&s;lation &s;hould be
recommended and introduced into the world,
with the whole art and influence of the &s;ociety.</P>
<P>This affair being &s;ettled to the &s;atisfaction of
all pre&s;ent, an author of &s;ome character &s;tood
up, and craved the advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his
fellows, in puni&s;hing a certain nobleman of great
preten&s;ions to ta&s;te, who, in con&s;equence of a
production which this gentleman had u&s;hered into
the world, with univer&s;al applau&s;e, not only de|&s;ired,
but even eagerly courted his acquaintance.
&startq;He invited me to his hou&s;e (&s;aid he) where I
was overwhelmed with civility and profe&s;&s;ions of
friend&s;hip. He in&s;i&s;ted upon my treating him
as an intimate, and calling upon him at all hours,
without ceremony; he made me promi&s;e to break|fa&s;t
with him at lea&s;t three times a week: In
&s;hort, I looked upon my&s;elf as very fortunate,
in meeting with &s;uch advances from a man of his
intere&s;t and reputation, who had it in his power
<PB N="103" REF="109">
to befriend me effectually in my pa&s;&s;age through
life; and, that I might not give him any cau&s;e
to think I neglected his friend&s;hip, I went to his
hou&s;e in two days, with a view of drinking cho|colate,
according to appointment: but he had
been &s;o much fatigued with dancing at an a&s;&s;embly
over night, that his valet de chambre would not
venture to wake him &s;o early; and I left my
compliments to his lord&s;hip, with a performance
in manu&s;cript, which he had expre&s;&s;ed a mo&s;t
eager de&s;ire to peru&s;e. I repeated my vi&s;it next
morning, that his impatience to &s;ee me might
not have &s;ome violent effect upon his con&s;titu|tion;
and received a me&s;&s;age from his mini&s;ter,
&s;ignifying, that he had been highly entertained
with the manu&s;cript I had left, a great part of
which he had read, but was at pre&s;ent &s;o bu&s;y in
contriving a proper dre&s;s for a private ma&s;querade,
which would be given that &s;ame evening, that he
could not have the plea&s;ure of my company at break|fa&s;t.
This was a fea&s;ible excu&s;e, which I admitted
accordingly, and in a day or two appeared again,
when his lord&s;hip was particularly engaged. This
might po&s;&s;ibly be the ca&s;e; and therefore I re|turned
the fourth time, in hopes of finding him
more at lei&s;ure; but he had gone out about half
an hour before my arrival, and left my perfor|mance
with his valet de chambre, who a&s;&s;ured
me, that his lord had peru&s;ed it with infinite plea|&s;ure.
Perhaps I might have retired very well
&s;atisfied with this declaration, had not I$ in my
pa&s;&s;age through the hall, heard one of the foot|men,
upon the top of the &s;tair-ca&s;e, pronounce
with an audible voice, &startq;Will your lord&s;hip
plea&s;e to be at home, when he calls?&endq; It is not
to be &s;uppo&s;ed that I was plea&s;ed at this di&s;covery,
<PB N="104" REF="110">
which I no &s;ooner made, than turning to my
conductor, &startq;I find, (&s;aid I) his lord&s;hip is di&s;|po&s;ed
to be abroad to more people than me this
morning.&endq; The fellow (though a valet de cham|bre)
blu&s;hed at this ob&s;ervation; and I with|drew,
not a little irritated at the &s;illy peer's di&s;in|genuity,
and fully re&s;olved to &s;pare him my vi|&s;its
for the future. It was not long after this
occa&s;ion, that I happened to meet him in the
park, and being naturally civil, I could not pa&s;s
him without a &s;alutation of the hat, which he
returned in the mo&s;t di&s;tant manner, though we
were both &s;olitary, and not a &s;oul within view;
and when that very performance, which he had
applauded &s;o warmly, was lately publi&s;hed by &s;ub|&s;cription,
he did not be&s;peak &s;o much as one
copy. I have often reflected with wonder upon
this ridiculous incon&s;i&s;tency in the man's conduct,
which looks like the re&s;ult of a &s;ettled de&s;ign to
render him&s;elf odious and contemptible. I never
courted his patronage, nor indeed thought of his
name, until he made intere&s;t for my acquaintance;
and if he was di&s;appointed in my conver&s;ation,
why did he pre&s;s me &s;o much to further con|nexion?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The ca&s;e is very clear, (cried the chair|man,
interrupting him) he is one of tho&s;e cox|combs
who &s;et up for ta&s;te, and value them|&s;elves
upon knowing all men of genius, whom
they would be thought to a&s;&s;i&s;t in their produc|tions.
I will lay an even bet with any man,
that his lord&s;hip, on the &s;trength of that &s;lender
interview, together with the opportunity of hav|ing
&s;een your performance in manu&s;cript, has al|ready
hinted to every company in which he is
conver&s;ant, that you &s;olicited his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in re|touching
<PB N="105" REF="111">
the piece, which you have now offered
to the publick, and that he was plea&s;ed to favour
you with his advice, but found you ob&s;tinately
bigotted to your own opinion, in &s;ome points re|lating
to tho&s;e very pa&s;&s;ages which have not met
with the approbation of the town. And as for his
care&s;&s;es, there was nothing at all extraordinary
in his behaviour. By that time you have lived
to my age, you will not be &s;urprized to &s;ee a
courtier's promi&s;e and performance of a different
complexion: not but that I would willingly act
as an auxiliary to your re&s;entment, if I thought
it was po&s;&s;ible to make him repent of his pitiful
di&s;&s;imulation; but, if I gue&s;s aright, the per&s;on
you mean, has long ago conquered all &s;en&s;e of
probity and &s;hame, and therefore is effectually
&s;hielded again&s;t the revenge of an author.&endq;</P>
<P>The opinion of the pre&s;ident was &s;anctioned
by the concurrence of all the members; and all
other complaints and memorials being deferred
till another &s;itting, the college proceeded to an
exerci&s;e of wit, which was generally performed
once every fortnight, with a view to promote the
expectoration of genius. The &s;ubject was occa|&s;ionally
cho&s;en by the chairman, who opened
the game with &s;ome &s;hrewd remark naturally
ari&s;ing from the conver&s;ation; and then the ball
was to&s;&s;ed about from one corner of the room
to the other, according to the motions of the
&s;pirit.</P>
<P>That the reader may have a ju&s;t idea of this
&s;port, and of the abilities of tho&s;e who carried
it on, I &s;hall repeat the &s;allies of this evening,
according to the order and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in which
they e&s;caped. One of the members ob&s;erving
<PB N="106" REF="112">
that Mr. Metaphor was ab&s;ent, was told by the
per&s;on who &s;at next to him, that the poet had
foul weather at home, and could not &s;tir abroad,
&startq;What! (&s;aid the pre&s;ident, interpo&s;ing, with
the &s;ignal upon his countenance) is he wind-bound
in port?&endq; &startq;Wine-bound, I &s;uppo&s;e,&endq;
(cried another.) &startq;Hooped with wine! a &s;trange
metaphor!&endq; (&s;aid a third.) &startq;Not if he has
got into a hog&s;head,&endq; (an&s;wered a fourth.) &startq;The
hog&s;head will &s;ooner get into him, (replied a
fifth) it mu&s;t be a tun or an ocean.&endq; &startq;No
wonder then, if he &s;hould be overwhelmed,&endq;
(&s;aid a &s;ixth.) &startq;If &s;he &s;hould, (cried a &s;eventh)
he will ca&s;t up when his gall breaks.&endq; &startq;That
mu&s;t be very &s;oon, (roared an eighth) for it has
been long ready to bur&s;t.&endq; &startq;No, no, (ob|&s;erved
a ninth) he'll &s;tick fa&s;t at the bottom,
take my word for it; he has a <HI>natural alacrity
in &s;inking.</HI>&endq; &startq;And yet, (remarked a tenth) I
have &s;een him in the clouds.&endq; &startq;Then was he
cloudy, I &s;uppo&s;e, (cried the eleventh.) &startq;So
dark, (replied the other) that his meaning could
not be perceived.&endq; &startq;For all that, (&s;aid the
twelfth) he is ea&s;ily &s;een through.&endq; &startq;You
talk, (an&s;wered a thirteenth) as if his head was
made of gla&s;s.&endq; &startq;No, no, (cried a fourteenth)
his head is made of more durable &s;tuff; it will
bend before it breaks.&endq; &startq;Yet I have &s;een it
broken,&endq; (re&s;umed the pre&s;ident.) &startq;Did you
perceive any wit come out at the hole?&endq; (&s;aid
another.) &startq;His wit (replied the chairman) is
too &s;ubtile to be perceived.&endq;</P>
<P>A third mouth was ju&s;t opened, when the
exerci&s;e was &s;uddenly interrupted by the dread|ful
cry of fire, which i&s;&s;ued from the kitchen,
<PB N="107" REF="113">
and involved the whole college in confu&s;ion.
Every man endeavouring to be the fir&s;t in mak|ing
his exit, the door and pa&s;&s;age were blocked
up; each individual was pummelled by the per|&s;on
that happened to be behind him. This com|munication
produced noi&s;e and exclamation;
clouds of &s;moke rolled upwards into the apart|ment,
and terror &s;at on every brow; when Pere|grine
&s;eeing no pro&s;pect of retreating by the
door, opened one of the windows, and fairly
leapt into the &s;treet, where he found a crowd of
people a&s;&s;embled to contribute their a&s;&s;i&s;tance in
extingui&s;hing the flames. Several members of
the college followed his example, and happily
accompli&s;hed their e&s;cape: the chairman him&s;elf
being unwilling to u&s;e the &s;ame expedient, &s;tood
trembling on the brink of de&s;cent, dubious of his
own agility, and dreading the con&s;equence of
&s;uch a leap, when a chair happening to pa&s;s, he
laid hold on the opportunity, and by an exertion
of his mu&s;cles pitched upon the top of the car|riage,
which was immediately overturned in the
kennel, to the grievous annoyance of the fare,
which happened to be a certain effeminate beau,
in full dre&s;s, on his way to a private a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>This phantom of a man, hearing the noi&s;e
overhead, and feeling the &s;hock of being over|thrown,
at the &s;ame time, thought that &s;ome
whole tenement had fallen upon the chair, and,
in the terror of being cru&s;hed to pieces, uttered
a &s;cream which the populace &s;uppo&s;ed to proceed
from the mouth of a woman; and therefore
went to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, while the chairmen, in|&s;tead
of mini&s;tring to his occa&s;ions, no &s;ooner re|collected
them&s;elves, than they ran in pur&s;uit of
their overthrower, who being accu&s;tomed to
<PB N="108" REF="114">
e&s;capes from bailiffs, dived into a dark alley, and
vani&s;hing in a trice, was not vi&s;ible to any living
&s;oul, until he appeared next day on Tower-hill.</P>
<P>The humane part of the mob, who be&s;tirred
them&s;elves for the relief of the &s;uppo&s;ed lady, no
&s;ooner perceived their mi&s;take, in the appearance
of the beau, who &s;tared around him with horror
and affright, than their compa&s;&s;ion was changed
into mirth, and they began to pa&s;s a great many
unfavoury jokes upon his misfortune, which
they now di&s;covered no inclination to alleviate;
and he found him&s;elf very uncomfortably be&s;et,
when Pickle pitying his &s;ituation, interpo&s;ed in
his behalf, and prevailed upon the chairmen to
carry him into the hou&s;e of an apothecary in the
neighbourhood, to whom his mi&s;chance proved
a very advantageous accident; for the fright
operated &s;o violently upon his nerves, that he
was &s;eized with a delirium, and lay a whole fort|night,
deprived of his &s;en&s;es; during which pe|riod
he was not neglected in point of medicines,
food and attendance, but royally regaled, as ap|peared
by the contents of his landlord's bill.</P>
<P>Our adventurer having &s;een this unfortunate
beau &s;afely hou&s;ed, returned to the &s;cene of the
other calamity, which, as it was no other than
a foul vent, &s;oon yielded to the endeavours of
the family, and was happily overcome, without
any other bad con&s;equence than that of alarming
the neighbours, di&s;turbing the college, and di&s;|ordering
the brain of a beau.</P>
<P>Eager to be acquainted with the particular
con&s;titutions of a &s;ociety which &s;eemed to open
upon him by degrees, Mr. Pickle did not fail to
appear at the next meeting, when &s;everal peti|tions
were laid before the board, in behalf of
<PB N="109" REF="115">
tho&s;e members who were confined in the pri&s;ons
of the Fleet, Mar&s;hal&s;ea, and King's bench. As
tho&s;e unhappy authors expected nothing from
their brethren but advice and good offices, which
did not concern the pur&s;e, their memorials were
con&s;idered with great care and humanity; and,
upon this occa&s;ion, Peregrine had it in his power
to manife&s;t his importance to the community;
for he happened to be acquainted with the credi|tor
of one of the pri&s;oners, and knew that gentle|man's
&s;everity was owing to his re&s;entment at the
behaviour of the debtor, who had lampooned
him in print, becau&s;e he refu&s;ed to comply with
a fre&s;h demand, after he had lent him money to
the amount of a con&s;iderable &s;um. Our young
gentleman therefore under&s;tanding that the au|thor
was penitent, and di&s;po&s;ed to make a rea|&s;onable
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, promi&s;ed to employ his in|fluence
with the creditor towards an accommo|dation;
and, in a few days, actually obtained
his relea&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ocial duties being di&s;charged, the con|ver&s;ation
took a general turn, and &s;everal new
productions were freely critici&s;ed; tho&s;e e&s;pe|cially
which belonged to authors who were either
unconnected with, or unknown to the college.
Nor did the profe&s;&s;ion of &s;tage-playing e&s;cape the
cognizance of the a&s;&s;embly: a deputation of the
mo&s;t judicious members being &s;ent weekly to
each theatre, with a view of making remarks
upon the performance of the actors. The two
cen&s;ors for the preceding week were accordingly
called upon to give in their report; and the
plays which they had reviewed were the <HI>Fair Pe|nit$nt</HI>
and the <HI>Revenge.</HI> The per&s;on who had
<PB N="110" REF="116">
examined the former of the&s;e tragedies, owned
that he had made no material ob&s;ervations upon
the principal performers: he &s;aid he was, upon
the whole, very well entertained, tho' he had,
at fir&s;t, mi&s;taken Lothario, by his dre&s;s, for a
puppet-&s;hew man, hired for the entertainment of
the gue&s;ts at Cali&s;ta's wedding; and was after|wards
a little &s;urpri&s;ed at his unrea&s;onable de|mand,
when, in challenging Horatio to &s;ingle
combat, he de&s;ired &s;uch an unweildy antagoni&s;t
to meet him a whole mile among rocks; an ex|pedition
which could not be performed without
imminent danger of broken bones.</P>
<P>Peregrine imagining that this remark proceed|ed
from his ignorance of the play, ob&s;erved that
the critick might po&s;&s;ibly be mi&s;led by the words
of the defiance, which run thus:
<Q><L>We&s;t of the town a mile, among the rocks,</L>
<L>Two hours ere noon to-morrow I expect thee.</L></Q></P>
<P>&startq;Sir (an&s;wered the cen&s;or) I am not acquaint|ed
with the text, el&s;e I &s;hould have placed my
ob&s;ervation to the account of the author, in&s;tead
of the actor, who made a full &s;top at the word
<HI>town,</HI> and then pronounced&mdash;<HI>a mile among the
rocks,</HI> without the lea&s;t pau&s;e of di&s;tinction. Per|haps,
indeed, in the re&s;earches of his great pe|netration,
he may have di&s;covered that this is the
genuine pointing of the poet, and that Lothario
had actually a de&s;ign upon the &s;hins of Alta|mont's
friend: in which ca&s;e he is to be com|mended
for this, among his other improvements
in the art of acting; yet I cannot approve of his
refinements in the my&s;tery of dying hard; his
fall, and the circum&s;tances of his death, in the
<PB N="111" REF="117">
character of this gay libertine, being, in my opi|nion,
a lively repre&s;entation of a tinker oppre&s;&s;ed
with gin, who &s;taggers again&s;t a po&s;t, tumbles
into the kennel, while his hammer and &s;aucepan
drop from his hands, makes divers convul&s;ive
efforts to ri&s;e, and finding him&s;elf unable to get
up, with many intervening hiccups, addre&s;&s;es
him&s;elf to the &s;urrounding mob.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I confe&s;s (replied Pickle) the action of that
&s;ame player is not free from unnatural violence
and ridiculous ge&s;ticulation: a kind of fal&s;e fire
in which he finds his account with the audience,
who never fail to honour it with particular marks
of applau&s;e; but I think the &s;imile of the tinker
is too &s;evere, and rather one of tho&s;e grote&s;que
compari&s;ons which may &s;ubject the mo&s;t grave
and &s;olemn incidents to ridicule, than a fair and
candid illu&s;tration of the fact: as for the perver|&s;ion
of the author's &s;en&s;e, by an impropriety in
the declamation, it &s;o commonly occurs, even
in the mo&s;t celebrated actors, that one would
think it was an ob&s;tacle not to be &s;urmounted:
the delightful lullaby of the &s;tage is an e&s;tabli&s;hed
recitative, which &s;eems to have been compo&s;ed
on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the &s;entence is always
concluded at the end of the line; and when the
la&s;t word happens to begin a new period, the
&s;en&s;e of the whole mu&s;t &s;uffer accordingly. I
have heard the Ae&s;opus of the age, who values
him&s;elf upon accurate &s;peaking, commit innume|rable
blunders of this kind, one of which I, at
pre&s;ent, recollect, in a pa&s;&s;age of a late play,
which he repeated in this manner:
<Q><L>To beg protection for the men who lie,&mdash;</L>
<L>Trembling behind their ramparts.</L></Q>
<PB N="112" REF="118">
Thus he brought the poor Romans under the
imputation of fal&s;hood as well as fear; for, ac|cording
to his pau&s;e, they told lies, as well as
trembled behind their ramparts.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The&s;e are no other than petty over&s;ights;
(&s;aid the &s;econd cen&s;or) that gentleman (take him
all in all) is certainly the mo&s;t compleat and un|blemi&s;hed
performer that ever appeared on out
&s;tage, notwith&s;tanding the blind adoration which
is paid to his rival. I went two nights ago, with
an expre&s;s de&s;ign to criticize his action: I could
find no room for cen&s;ure, but infinite &s;ubject for
admiration and applau&s;e. In <HI>Pierre</HI> he is great,
in <HI>Othello</HI> excellent, but in <HI>Zanga</HI> beyond all
imitation. Over and above the di&s;tinctne&s;s of
pronunciation, the dignity of attitude and ex|pre&s;&s;ion
of face, his ge&s;tures are &s;o ju&s;t and &s;ignifi|cant,
that a man, tho' utterly bereft of the &s;en&s;e
of hearing, might, by &s;eeing him only, under|&s;tand
the meaning of every word he &s;peaks!
Sure nothing can be more exqui&s;ite than his
manner of telling I&s;abella how Alonzo behaved
when he found the incendiary letter which &s;he
had dropt by the Moor's direction; and when,
to crown his vengeance, he di&s;covers him&s;elf to
be the contriver of all the mi&s;chief that had hap|pened,
he manife&s;ts a perfect ma&s;ter piece of
action, in pronouncing the&s;e four little mono|&s;yllables,
<HI>Kn$w then, 'twas&mdash;I.</HI></P>
<P>Peregrine having eyed the critick &s;ome mi|nutes,
&startq;I fancy (&s;aid he) your prai&s;e mu&s;t be
ironical, becau&s;e, in the very two &s;ituations you
mention, I think I have &s;een that player out|herod
Herod, or, in other words, exceed all his
other extravagances. The intention of the au|thor
<PB N="113" REF="119">
is, that the Moor &s;hould communicate to
his confidante a piece of information contained in
a few lines, which, doubtle&s;s, ought to be re|peated
with an air of eagerne&s;s and &s;atisfaction,
not with the ridiculous grimace of a monkey, to
which, methought, his action bore an intimate
re&s;emblance, in uttering this plain &s;entence:
<Q><L>&mdash;he took it up;</L>
<L>But &s;carce was it unfolded to his &s;ight,</L>
<L>When he, as if an arrow pierc'd his eye,</L>
<L>Started, and trembling dropt it on the ground.</L></Q>
In pronouncing the fir&s;t two words, this egre|gious
actor &s;toops down, and &s;eems to take up
&s;omething from the &s;tage, then proceeding to re|peat
what follows, mimicks the manner of un|folding
a letter; when he mentions the &s;imile of
an arrow piercing the eye, he darts his forefinger
towards that organ, then recoils with great vio|lence
when the word <HI>&s;tarted</HI> is expre&s;&s;ed; and
when he comes to <HI>trembling dropt it on the ground,</HI>
he throws all his limbs into a tremulous motion,
and &s;hakes the imaginary paper from his hand.
The latter part of the de&s;cription is carried on
with the &s;ame minute ge&s;ticulation, while he &s;ays,
<Q><L>Pale and agha&s;t a while my victim &s;tood,</L>
<L>Di&s;gui&s;ed a &s;igh or two, and puff'd them from him;</L>
<L>Then rubb'd his brow, and took it up again.</L></Q>
The player's countenance a&s;&s;umes a wild &s;tare, he
&s;ighs twice mo&s;t piteou&s;ly, as if he were on the
point of &s;uffocation, &s;crubs his forehead, and
bending his body, apes the action of &s;natching an
object from the floor. Nor is this dexterity of
dumb &s;hew omitted, when he concludes his inti|mation
in the&s;e three lines:
<Q><PB N="114" REF="120">
<L>At fir&s;t, he look'd as if he meant to read it;</L>
<L>But, check'd by ri&s;ing fears, he cru&s;h'd it thus,</L>
<L>And thru&s;t it, like an adder, in his bo&s;om.</L></Q>
Here the judicious performer imitates the con|fu&s;ion
and concern of Alonzo, &s;eems to ca&s;t his
eyes upon &s;omething, from which they are imme|diately
withdrawn, with horror and precipitation,
then &s;hutting his fi&s;t with a violent &s;queeze, as if
he intended to make immediate application to
I&s;abella's no&s;e, he rams it in his own bo&s;om, with
all the horror and agitation of a thief taken in the
manner. Were the player debarred the u&s;e of
&s;peech, and obliged to act to the eyes only of the
audience, this mimickry might be a nece&s;&s;ary
conveyance of his meaning; but when he is at
liberty to &s;ignify his ideas by language, nothing
can be more trivial, forced, unnatural and an|tick,
than this &s;uperfluous mummery. Not that
I would exclude from the repre&s;entation the graces
of action, without which the choice&s;t &s;entiments,
cloathed in the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite expre&s;&s;ion, would
appear unanimated and in&s;ipid; but the&s;e are as
different from this ridiculous burle&s;que, as is the
demeanor of a Tully in the ro&s;trum, from the
tricks of a Jack-pudding on a mountebank's &s;tage&punc;
and for the truth of what I alledge, I appeal to
the ob&s;ervation of any per&s;on who has con&s;idered
the elegance of attitude and propriety of ge&s;ture,
as they are univer&s;ally acknowledged in the real
characters of life. Indeed I have known a Ga$|con,
who&s;e limbs were as eloquent as his tongue:
he never mentioned the word &s;leep without re|clining
his head upon his hand; when he had oc|ca&s;ion
to talk of an hor&s;e, he always &s;tarted up
and trotted acro&s;s the room, except when he
<PB N="115" REF="121">
was &s;o &s;ituated that he could not &s;tir without in|commoding
the company, and in that ca&s;e he con|tented
him&s;elf with neighing aloud: if a dog hap|pened
to be the &s;ubject of his conver&s;ation, he
wagged his tail, and grinned in a mo&s;t &s;ignificant
manner; and one day he expre&s;&s;ed his de&s;ire of
going backwards with &s;uch natural imitation of
his purpo&s;e, that every body in the room firmly
believed he had actually over&s;hot him&s;elf, and
fortified their no&s;trils accordingly. Yet no man
ever looked upon this virtuo&s;o to be the &s;tandard
of propriety in point of &s;peaking and deportment.
For my own part, I confe&s;s the player in que&s;tion
would, by dint of the&s;e qualifications, make a
very good figure in the character of Pantaloon's
lacquey, in the entertainment of Per&s;eus and An|dromeda,
and perhaps might acquire &s;ome repu|tation,
by turning the <HI>Revenge</HI> into a pantomime;
in which cau&s;e, I would advi&s;e him to come upon
the &s;tage, provided with an handful of flour, in
order to be&s;mear his face, when he pronounces
<HI>$$le and agha&s;t,</HI> &amp;c. and methinks he ought to
illu&s;trate the adder with an hideous hi&s;s. But
let us now come to the other &s;ituation, in which
this modern Ae&s;opus is &s;uppo&s;ed to di&s;tingui&s;h
him&s;elf &s;o much, I mean that &s;ame <HI>eclairci&s;&s;ement</HI>
comprehended in <HI>Know then 'twas&mdash;I.</HI> His
manner, I own, may be altered &s;ince I was pre|&s;ent
at the repre&s;entation of that performance;
but certain I am, when I beheld him in that cri|tical
conjuncture, his behaviour appeared to me
&s;o uncouth, that I really imagined he was vi&s;ited
by &s;ome epileptic di&s;temper; for he &s;tood totter|ing
and ga&s;ping for the &s;pace of two minutes, like
a man &s;uddenly &s;truck with the pal&s;y; and after
various di&s;tor&s;ions and &s;ide-&s;hakings, as if he had
<PB N="116" REF="122">
got fleas in his doublet, heaved up from his lungs
the letter <HI>I,</HI> like a huge anchor from foul
ground.&endq;</P>
<P>This critici&s;m was acceptable to the majority
of the college, who had no great veneration for
the player in que&s;tion; and his admirer, without
making any reply, a&s;ked in a whi&s;per, of the
gentleman who &s;at next to him, if Pickle had not
offered &s;ome production to the &s;tage, and met
with a repul&s;e. This que&s;tion was not conveyed
&s;o &s;oftly, but that it reached the ears of our ad|venturer,
who &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to make &s;ome an|&s;wer,
when he was prevented by the interpo&s;ition
of another member, who begged the opinion and
advice of the community, touching a pa&s;toral
which he had ju&s;t compo&s;ed. Before he had
time to produce the performance to the in&s;pec|tion
of the &s;ociety, the chairman ob&s;erved,
with a &s;plenetic air, that he ought to have em|ployed
his time in &s;ome more profitable amu&s;e|ment,
than a &s;pecies of writing in which he had
formerly met with &s;o little &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>&startq;True it is (replied the author) my la&s;t pro|duction
of this kind was not very favourably re|ceived;
a circum&s;tance intirely owing to the na|ture
of the &s;ubject, which did not at all intere&s;t
the pa&s;&s;ions of the heart: but here, my dear Sir,
the ca&s;e is otherwi&s;e; this pa&s;toral I compo&s;ed
upon the death of my own grandmother, who
was a woman, in all re&s;pects, worthy of the
tears I have &s;hed over her tomb; and this &s;mall
compo&s;ition is the genuine offspring of unfeigned
&s;orrow: the blots which are &s;till vi&s;ible on the
paper, indicate the grief with which I wrote it.
<HI>Lachrymae fec&ecirc;re lituras.</HI> And &s;ure he mu&s;t have
<PB N="117" REF="123">
a flinty heart who can hear it read with an un|mo$&s;tened
eye.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If that be the ca&s;e (&s;aid the pre&s;ident) I
wi&s;h you would &s;pare us the affliction of hearing
it rehears'd: all of us, I believe, have real
grievances of our own; &s;o that we need not hunt
after imaginary &s;orrows.&endq; The poet, notwith|&s;tanding
this di&s;couragement, begg'd hard that he
might exhibit a &s;pecimen of his performance; and
being re&s;tricted to a few lines, he repeated the
following &s;tanzas, with the mo&s;t rueful empha&s;is.</P>

</LG>
<P>The&s;e interjections at the clo&s;e of this pathetic
elegy, were not pronounced without the &s;obs and
tears of the author, who looked wi&s;hfully around
him for applau&s;e, and having wiped his eyes,
a&s;ked the chairman's opinion of what he had
read. That cynical gentleman, who had no
great devotion for the Arcadian, an&s;wered with
a mo&s;t equivocal a&s;pect, &startq;Sad, very &s;ad! &s;ad
enough to draw tears from the eyes of a bum|bailiff.&endq;
But as the performance was &s;ubmitted
to the critici&s;m of the whole &s;ociety, the epic
poet &s;tood up, and thus communicated his &s;en|timents.</P>
<P>&startq;Without entering upon a minute inquiry into
the poetical merits of particular images, I mu&s;t
in general ob&s;erve, that the &s;tanzas are &s;o irre|gular
<PB N="119" REF="125">
in point of mea&s;ure, as well as in the num|ber
of the lines, that they cannot be compre|hended
under any &s;pecies of the ancient ver&s;ifi|cation.
Then there are many dark allu&s;ions in
the <HI>Anti&s;trophe,</HI> which no reader can po&s;&s;ibly un|der&s;tand,
together with a catalogue of the names
of places, for which the author &s;eems to have
rambled &s;trangely from his &s;ubject, more &s;tudious
of making a &s;illy parade of his &s;kill in poetical
geography, than of intere&s;ting the pa&s;&s;ions of
the heart. Indeed, one would be apt to con|clude
from this circum&s;tance, that his grief was
mere affectation, did not he blubber &s;o piteou&s;ly
in the la&s;t ver&s;e. I could have wi&s;hed, that more
dignity had been pre&s;erved in the &s;tanza which
de&s;cribes the old gentlewoman's benevolence,
and that the la&s;t line had been altogether omitted,
becau&s;e it conjures up a mo&s;t ridiculous image of
her having actually hatched that &s;ame poultry,

<P>To the&s;e animadver&s;ions the cen&s;ured bard re|plied,
that the ver&s;e, in being irregular, the more
nearly re&s;embled the natural exclamations of real
affliction, and that &s;uch irregularity had not only
been excu&s;ed, but even con&s;idered as a beauty
in many modern productions. He owned, that
the allu&s;ions might be ob&s;cure to &s;ome readers,
and therefore he intended to explain them in
notes, at the bottom of the page. As to the
topical de&s;criptions which the critic had cen&s;ured
&s;o &s;everely, he &s;aid they were in&s;erted to amu&s;e
and relieve the imagination of the reader, that he
might not be too much affected with the <HI>Pathos</HI>
of the &s;ubject; and with regard to the line,
<Q><PB N="320" REF="126">
As if &s;he common mother were of all,</Q>
far from carrying that ludicrous implication he
had mentioned, it certainly conveyed the mo&s;t
amiable and parental idea of the decea&s;ed; and
he did not doubt, that he &s;hould find his own
opinion confirmed by that of the public, in a very
comfortable &s;ale of the work.</P>
<P>&startq;So, after all this profe&s;&s;ion of filial tenderne&s;s,
(cried the epic bard) the world will have &s;ome
rea&s;on to &s;ay, you wanted to make a job of your
grandmother's death.&endq; &startq;Perhaps (an&s;wered the

book&s;eller.&endq; &startq;If you de&s;ire to be thought al|together
di&s;intere&s;ted in the affair, (re&s;umed the
critic) you ought to print a few copies at your
own expence, and di&s;tribute them <HI>gratis</HI> among
your friends; by the&s;e means, you will have as
good a chance to &s;ee your own talents admired,
and the memory of your grandame immortalized,
as if you had &s;old the property of the piece for a
thou&s;and pounds.&endq;</P>
<P>This propo&s;al &s;eemed to di&s;concert the elegiac
writer; when the chairman interpo&s;ing, &startq;P&s;haw!
(&s;aid he) why the devil &s;hould he be more deli|cate
in that re&s;pect, than tho&s;e people who fit at

to which you have objected, he has expre&s;sly

of the univer&s;al patron.&endq; &startq;What!
(replied the other) you mean the famous Go&s;ling
$word$ E&s;&abque; &s;on and heir of Sir Marmaduke Scrag,
who &s;eats him&s;elf in the chair of judgment, and
gives &s;entence upon the authors of the age. I
&s;hould be glad to know, upon what preten&s;ions
<PB N="121" REF="127">
to genius this preheminence is founded. Do a
few flim&s;y odes, barren epi&s;tles, pointle&s;s epigrams,
and the &s;uper&s;titious &s;ugge&s;tions of an half-witted
enthu&s;ia&s;t, intitle him to that eminent rank he
maintains in the world of letters? or did he ac|quire
the reputation of a wit, by a repetition of
trite invectives again&s;t a mini&s;ter, conveyed in a
theatrical cadence, accompanied with the mo&s;t
ridiculous ge&s;tures, before he believed it was his
intere&s;t to de&s;ert his ma&s;ter, and renounce his
party? For my own part, I never peru&s;ed any
of his performances, I never &s;aw him open his
mouth in public, I never heard him &s;peak in
private conver&s;ation, without recollecting and ap|plying
the&s;e two lines in Pope's Dunciad,
<Q><L>Dulne&s;s delighted, ey'd the lively dunce,</L>
<L>Remembring &s;he her&s;elf was pertne&s;s once.</L></Q>
Yet this antick piece of futility will decide dog|matically
upon the merits of every new work;
and if the author has not previou&s;ly &s;cratched
him&s;elf into his favour, will pronounce upon it,
with all the in&s;olence and contempt of &s;uperci|lious
pre&s;umption. Nor is the levity of his head
le&s;s provoking than his arrogance and &s;elf-conceit;
the very performance which he ye&s;terday ap|plauded,
will he to-morrow condemn through
mere caprice; and that which he ye&s;terday men|tioned
in terms of di&s;dain, will he to-morrow
extol to the &s;kies, provided the author will
humble him&s;elf &s;o far, as to adore his &s;uperior
genius, and meanly beg his protection. Never
did he befriend a man of poetical merit, who did
not court and retain his favour by &s;uch &s;lavi&s;h
pro&s;titution, except one author, lately decea&s;ed;
<PB N="122" REF="128">
and even he extended his complai&s;ance too far,
in complimental lines, which the warmth of his
gratitude in&s;pired, though he would never &s;ubmit
to the tame critici&s;ms of his patron, or offer &s;uch
an outrage to his own judgment, as to adopt the
alterations which he propo&s;ed.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;One would imagine, (&s;aid the chairman)
that you had made an un&s;ucce&s;sful application to
his patronage; but, notwith&s;tanding all this elo|quent
declamation, the truth of which I &s;hall
not pretend to invalidate, I do aver, that Go&s;ling
Scrag E&s;&abque; is at this day the be&s;t milch-cow that
any author ever &s;troaked: for, over and above
his vanity, which lays him open to the nece&s;&s;ities
of all writers who can tickle, though never &s;o
awkwardly, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;uch a comfortable &s;hare
of &s;implicity, or rather lack of penetration, as
cannot fail to turn to account with tho&s;e who
practi&s;e upon it. Let a &s;cribbler (for example)
creep into his notice by the mo&s;t abject venera|tion,
implore his judgment upon &s;ome perfor|mance,
a&s;&s;ume a look of awful admiration at his
remarks, receive and read his emendations with
pretended exta&s;y, exert him&s;elf officiou&s;ly about
his per&s;on, make intere&s;t to be employed in
running upon his errands, bawl for him upon all
occa&s;ions in common conver&s;ation, pro&s;e and
rhime, &s;it in pre&s;ence of this great man, with
an apparent &s;en&s;e of his own nothingne&s;s, and
when he opens his mouth, li&s;ten <HI>with a fooli&s;h
face of prai&s;e;</HI> happy! if he has an opportunity
to feed him with the &s;oft pap of dedication, or
by affecting an idiotical ignorance of the manners
of life, to in&s;inuate him&s;elf into his opinion, as
a per&s;on ab&s;olutely detached from all worldly pur|&s;uits;
like a &s;ly brother of the quill, who, in
<PB N="123" REF="129">
going out, dropped a bank note upon the floor
of his apartment, in &s;uch a manner, as that it
could not e&s;cape the notice of Go&s;ling, who view|ing
it accordingly, &startq;Heavens! (&s;aid he, with
his hands and eyes lifted up) what philo&s;ophical
contempt mu&s;t that man have for the plea&s;ures
of wealth!&endq; Yes, I in&s;i&s;t upon it, the&s;e are
arts which will never fail to engage the friend|&s;hip
of Mr. Scrag, which will be &s;ooner or later
manife&s;ted in &s;ome warm &s;ine-cure, ample &s;ub|&s;cription,
po&s;t or rever&s;ion; and I advi&s;e Mr&punc;
Spondy to give him the refu&s;al of this &s;ame pa|&s;toral:
who knows but he may have the good
fortune of being li&s;ted in the number of his beef|eaters;
in which ca&s;e he may, in proce&s;s of
time, be provided for in the cu&s;toms or church;
when he is inclined to marry h$$ own cook-wench,
his gracious patron may conde&s;cend to
give the bride away; and finally &s;ettle him in his
old age, as a trading We&s;tmin&s;ter-ju&s;tice.&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Spondy thanked the pre&s;ident for his
whole&s;ome coun&s;el, which he a&s;&s;ured him &s;hould
not be neglected; and the evening being far ad|vanced,

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The young gentleman is introduced to a virtuo&s;o
of the fir&s;t order, and commences Yelper.</HEAD>
<P>HItherto Peregrine had profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf an
author, without reaping the fruits of that
occupation, except the little fame he had acquired
by his late $word$; but now he thought it
$span$ to weigh <HI>&s;olid pudding again&s;t emp$y prai&s;e;</HI>
<PB N="124" REF="130">
and therefore engaged with &s;ome book&s;ellers in a
certain tran&s;lation, which he obliged him&s;elf to
perform for the con&s;ideration of two hundred
pounds. The articles of agreement being drawn,
he began his ta&s;k with great eagerne&s;s, ro&s;e early
in the morning to his work, at which he laboured
all day long, went abroad with the bats in the
evening, and appeared in the coffee-hou&s;e, where
he amu&s;ed him&s;elf with the news-papers and
conver&s;ation till nine o'clock; then he retired to
his own apartment, and after a &s;light repa&s;t, be|took
him&s;elf to $e&s;t, that he might be able to
unroo&s;t with the cock. This &s;udden change
from his former way of life agreed &s;o ill with his
di&s;po&s;ition, that, for the fir&s;t time, he was trou|bled
with flatulencies and indige&s;tion, which pro|duced
anxiety and dejection of &s;pirits, and the
nature of his &s;ituation began in &s;ome mea&s;ure to
di&s;compo&s;e his brain; a di&s;covery which he no
&s;ooner made, than he had recour&s;e to the advice
of a young phy&s;ician, who was a member of
the college, and at this time one of our hero's
mo&s;t intimate acquaintance.</P>
<P>This &s;on of Ae&s;culapius having con&s;idered his
ca&s;e, imputed his di&s;order to the right cau&s;e,
namely, want of exerci&s;e; di&s;&s;uaded him from
&s;uch clo&s;e application to &s;tudy, until he &s;hould
be gradually familiarized to a &s;edentary life, ad|vi&s;ed
him to enjoy his friend and his bottle in mo|deration,
and wean him&s;elf from his former cu|&s;toms
by degrees; and, above all things, to ri&s;e
immediately after his fir&s;t &s;leep, and exerci&s;e him|&s;elf
in a morning-walk. In order to render this
l$&s;t part of the pre&s;cription the more palatable,
the doctor promi&s;ed to attend him in the&s;e early
excur&s;ions, and even to introduce him to a cer|tain
<PB N="125" REF="131">
per&s;onage of note, who gave a &s;ort of public
breakfa&s;ting to the minor virtuo&s;i of the age,
and often employed his intere&s;t in behalf of tho&s;e
who properly cultivated his countenance and ap|probation.</P>
<P>This propo&s;al was extremely acceptable to our
young gentleman, who, be&s;ides the advantage
which might accrue to him from &s;uch a valuable
connexion, fore&s;aw much entertainment and &s;a|tisfaction
in the di&s;cour&s;e of &s;o many learned
gue&s;ts. The occa&s;ions of his health and in|tere&s;t,
moreover, coincided in another circum|&s;tance,
the mini&s;ter's levee being kept betimes in
the morning; &s;o that he could perform his walk,
yield his attendance, and breakfa&s;t at this philo|&s;ophical
board, without incroaching a great deal
upon his other avocations.</P>
<P>Mea&s;ures being thus preconcerted, the phy&s;i|cian
conducted our adventurer to the hou&s;e of
this celebrated &s;age, to whom he recommended
him as a gentleman of genius and ta&s;te, who
craved the honour of his acquaintance; but he
had previou&s;ly &s;moothed the way to this intro|duction,
by repre&s;enting Peregrine as a young
fellow of great ambition, &s;pirit and addre&s;s, who
could not fail to make a figure in the world;
that, therefore, he would be a creditable addi|tion
to the &s;ubordinates of &s;uch a patron, and by
$word$ qualifications, intrepidity and warmth of tem|per,
turn out a con&s;ummate herald of his fame.
Upon the&s;e con&s;iderations, he met with a mo&s;t
$word$ reception from the entertainer, who
was a well-bred man, of &s;ome learning, genero|&s;ity
and ta&s;te; but his foible was the de&s;ire of
being thought the inimitable pattern of all three.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="132">
It was with a view to acquire and &s;upport this
character, that his hou&s;e was open to all tho&s;e
who had any preten&s;ions to literature; con&s;e|quently
he was &s;urrounded by a &s;trange variety
of pretenders; but none were di&s;couraged, be|cau&s;e
he knew that even the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant
might, in &s;ome &s;hape, conduce to the propaga|tion
of his prai&s;e. A babbler, tho' he cannot run
upon the &s;cent, may &s;pring the game, and by his
yelping help to fill up the cry: no wonder then,
that a youth of Pickle's accompli&s;hments was ad|mitted
and even invited into the pack. After
having enjoyed a very &s;hort private audience in
the clo&s;et, our young gentleman was &s;hewn into
another room, where half a dozen of his fellow-adherents
waited for their Maecenas, who in a
few minutes appeared, with a mo&s;t gracious a&s;|pect,
received the compliments of the morning,
and &s;at down to breakfa&s;t, in the mid&s;t of them,
without any further ceremony.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation at fir&s;t turned upon the wea|ther,
which was inve&s;tigated in a very philo&s;o|phical
manner by one of the company, who
&s;eemed to have con&s;ulted all the barometers and
thermometers that ever were invented, before
he would venture to affirm that it was a chill
morning. This &s;ubject being accurately di&s;cu&s;&s;ed,
the chief inquired about the news of the learned
world; and his inclination was no &s;ooner ex|pre&s;&s;ed
than every gue&s;t opened his mouth, in or|der
to gratify his curio&s;ity: but he that fir&s;t cap|tivated
his attention was a meagre, &s;hrivelled an|tiquary,
who looked like an animated mummy,
which had been &s;corched among the &s;ands of the
de&s;ert. He told the patron, that he had by ac|cident
met with a medal, which, tho' it was de|faced
<PB N="127" REF="133">
by time, he would venture to pronounce a
genuine antique, from the ringing and ta&s;te of the
metal, as well as from the colour and compo|&s;ition
of the ru&s;t: &s;o &s;aying, he produced a piece
of copper coin, &s;o con&s;umed and di&s;gui&s;ed by age,
that &s;carce a ve&s;tige of the impre&s;&s;ion was to be
perceived. Neverthele&s;s this connoi&s;&s;eur pre|tended
to di&s;tingui&s;h a face in profil, from which
he concluded that the piece was of the Upper em|pire,
and on the rever&s;e he endeavoured to point
out the bulb of the &s;pear, and part of the parazo|nium,
which were the in&s;ignia of the Roman Vir|tus,
together with the fragment of one fold of
the multicium in which &s;he was cloathed. He like|wi&s;e
had di&s;covered one angle of the letter N, and,
at &s;ome di&s;tance, an intire I: from the&s;e circum|&s;tances
conjecturing, and indeed concluding,
that the medal was &s;truck by Severus, in honour
of the victory he obtained over his rival Niger,
after he had forced the pa&s;&s;es of mount Taurus.
This critici&s;m &s;eemed very &s;atisfactory to the en|tertainer,
who having examined the coin by the
help of his &s;pectacles, plainly di&s;cerned the parti|culars
which the owner had mentioned, and was
plea&s;ed to term his account of the matter a very
ingenious explanation.</P>
<P>The curio&s;ity was circulated through the hands
of all pre&s;ent, and every virtuo&s;o, in his turn,
licked the copper, and rung it upon the hearth,
declaring his a&s;&s;ent to the judgment which had
been pronounced. At length, it fell under the in|&s;pection
of our young gentleman, who, tho' no
antiquarian, was very well acquainted with the
current coin of his own country, and no &s;ooner
ca&s;t his eyes upon this valuable antique, than he
affirmed, without he&s;itation, that it was no other
<PB N="128" REF="134">
than the ruins of an Engli&s;h farthing, and that
&s;ame &s;pear, parazonium, and multicium, the re|mains
of the emblems and drapery with which the
figure of Britannia is delineated on our copper-money.</P>
<P>This hardy a&s;&s;everation &s;eemed to di&s;concert
the patron, while it incen&s;ed the medalli&s;t, who
grinning like an enraged baboon, &startq;What d'ye
tell me of a bra&s;s farthing? (&s;aid he) Did you
ever know modern bra&s;s of &s;uch a reli&s;h? Do but
ta&s;te it, young gentleman; and &s;ure I am, if you
have ever been conver&s;ant with &s;ubjects of this kind,
you will find as wide a difference in the favour be|tween
this and an Engli&s;h farthing, as can po&s;|&s;ibly
be perceived betwixt an onion and a tur|nip:
be&s;ides, this medal has the true Corinthian
ring; then the attitude is upright, whereas that
of Britannia is reclining; and how is it po&s;&s;ible
to mi&s;take a branch of palm for a parazonium?&endq;</P>
<P>All the re&s;t of the company e&s;pou&s;ed the vir|tuo&s;o's
&s;ide of the que&s;tion, becau&s;e the reputation
of each was concerned; and the patron finding
him&s;elf in the &s;ame predicament, a&s;&s;umed a &s;o|lemnity
of feature, da&s;hed with a &s;mall mixture
of di&s;plea&s;ure, and told Peregrine, that as he had
not made that branch of literature his particular
&s;tudy, he was not &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee him mi&s;taken
in his opinion. Pickle immediately under&s;tood
the reproof; and tho' he was &s;hocked at the va|nity
or infatuation of his entertainer and fellow-gue&s;ts,
a&s;ked pardon for his pre&s;umption, which
was accordingly excu&s;ed, in con&s;ideration of his
inexperience; and the Engli&s;h &s;arthing dignified
with the title of a true antique.</P>
<P>The next per&s;on that addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the
chief was a gentleman of a very mathematical
<PB N="129" REF="135">
turn, who valued him&s;elf upon the improvements
he had made in &s;everal dome&s;tic machines, and
now pre&s;ented the plan of a new contrivance for
cutting cabbages, in &s;uch a manner as would &s;e|c$re
the &s;tock again&s;t the rotting rain, and enable
it to produce a plenteous after-crop of delicious
&s;prouts. In this important machine he had united
the whole mechanic powers, with &s;uch ma&s;&s;y
complication of iron and wood, that it could not
have been moved without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of an
hor&s;e, and a road made for the convenience of
the draught. The&s;e objections were &s;o obvious,
that they occurred at fir&s;t &s;ight to the in&s;pector-general
who greatly commended the invention,
which, he ob&s;erved, might be applied to &s;everal
other u&s;eful purpo&s;es, could it once be rendered
a little more portable and commodious.</P>
<P>The inventor, who had not fore&s;een the&s;e
difficulties, was not prepared to &s;urmount them;
but he took the hint in good part, and promi&s;ed
to ta&s;k his abilities anew, in altering the con&s;titu|tion
of his de&s;ign. Not but that he underwent
&s;ome &s;evere irony from the re&s;t of the virtuo&s;i,
who complimented him upon the momentous im|provement
he had made, by which a family
might &s;ave a di&s;h of greens in a quarter, for &s;o
trifling an expence as that of purcha&s;ing, work|ing
and maintaining &s;uch a &s;tupendous machine:
but no man was more &s;arca&s;tic in his remarks
upon this piece of mechani&s;m than the naturali&s;t,
who next appealed to the patron's approbation
for a curious di&s;qui&s;ition he had made, touching
the procreation of muck flies, in which he had
laid down a curious method of collecting, pre|&s;erving
and hatching the eggs of the&s;e in&s;ects,
even in the winter, by certain modifications of
<PB N="130" REF="136">
artificial heat. The nature of this di&s;covery was
no &s;ooner communicated, than Peregrine, un|able
to contain him&s;elf, bur&s;t into a fit of laugh|ter,
which in&s;ected every per&s;on at the table, the
landlord him&s;elf not excepted, who found it im|po&s;&s;ible
to pre&s;erve his wonted gravity of face.</P>
<P>Such unmannerly mirth did not fail to mortify
the philo&s;opher, who, after &s;ome pau&s;e, during
which indignation and di&s;dain were painted in his
countenance, reprehended our young gentleman
for his unphilo&s;ophical behaviour, and undertook
to prove, that the &s;ubject of his inquiry was of in|finite
con&s;equence to the progre&s;s and increa&s;e of
natural knowledge: but he found no quarter
from the vengeful engineer, who now retorted
his ironical compliments, with great empha&s;is,
upon this hot-bed for the generation of vermin,
and advi&s;ed him to lay the whole proce&s;s before
the Royal Society, which would, doubtle&s;s, pre|&s;ent
him with a medal, and give him a place
among their memoirs, as a di&s;tingui&s;hed pro|moter
of the u&s;eful arts. If (&s;aid he) you had
employed your &s;tudies in finding out &s;ome ef|fectual
method to de&s;troy tho&s;e infects which
prejudice and annoy mankind, in all probability
you mu&s;t have been contented with the contem|plation
of the good you had done; but this cu|rious
expedient for multiplying maggots, will
&s;urely intitle you to an honourable rank in the
li&s;t of learned philo&s;ophers.&endq; &startq;I don't wonder
(replied the naturali&s;t) that you &s;hould be &s;o
much adver&s;e to the propagation of in&s;ects, be|cau&s;e,
in all likelihood, you are afraid that they
will not leave you a cabbage to cut down with
that &s;ame miraculous machine.&endq; &startq;Sir (an&s;wered
the mechanic, with great bitterne&s;s of voice and
<PB N="131" REF="137">
a&s;pect) if the cabbage be as light-headed as &s;ome
muck-worm philo&s;ophers, it will not be worth
cutting down.&endq; &startq;I never di&s;pute upon cabbage
with the &s;on of a cucumber,&endq; &s;aid the fly-breeder,
alluding to the pedigree of his antago|ni&s;t;
who, impatient of the affront, &s;tarted up
with fury in his looks, exclaiming, &startq;'Sdeath!
meaning me, Sir?&endq;</P>
<P>Here the patron, perceiving things drawing
towards a rupture, interpo&s;ed his authority, re|buking
them for their intemperance, and recom|mending
to them amity and concord again&s;t the
Goths and Vandals of the age, who took all
opportunities of ridiculing and di&s;couraging the
adherents of knowledge and philo&s;ophy. After
this exhortation, they had no pretence for carry|ing
on the di&s;pute, which was dr$pt, in all ap|pearance,
tho' the mechanick &s;till retained his
re&s;entment; and after breakfa&s;t, when the com|pany
broke up, acco&s;ted his adver&s;ary in the
&s;treet, de&s;iring to know how he dur&s;t be &s;o in|&s;olent
as to make that &s;currilous reflection upon
his family: the fly-fancier, thus que&s;tioned, ac|cu&s;ed
the mathematician of having been the ag|gre&s;&s;or,
in likening his head to a light cabbage;
and here the altercation being renewed, the
engineer proceeded to the illu&s;tration of his me|chanicks,
tilting up his hand like a ballance,
thru&s;ting it forward by way of lever, embracing
the naturali&s;t's no&s;e like a wedge betwixt two of
his fingers, and turning it round, with the mo|mentum
of a &s;crew or peritrochium. Had they
been obliged to decide the di&s;pute, with equal
arms, the a&s;&s;ailant would have had a great advan|tage
over the other, who was very much his in|fer$or
in mu&s;cular &s;trength; but the philo&s;opher,
<PB N="132" REF="138">
being luckily provided with a cane, no &s;ooner
di&s;engaged him&s;elf from this opprobrious appli|cation,
than he handled his weapon with great
dexterity about the head and &s;houlders of his
antagoni&s;t, who, finding this &s;hower of blows
very di&s;agreeable, was fain to betake him&s;elf to
his heels for &s;helter, and was pur&s;ued by the
angry victor, who cha&s;ed him from one end o$
the &s;treet to the other, affording un&s;peakable &s;a|tisfaction
to the multitude, as well as to our hero
and his introductor, who were &s;pectators of the
whole &s;cene.</P>
<P>Thus was our adventurer initiated in the &s;o|ciety
of Yelpers, tho' he did not as yet fully un|der&s;tand
the nature of his office, which was ex|plained
by the young phy&s;ician, who chid him
for his blunt behaviour in the ca&s;e of the medal;
and gave him to under&s;tand, that their patron's
favour was neither to be gained, nor pre&s;erved by
any man that would pretend to convict him of a
mi&s;take: he therefore coun&s;elled him to re&s;pect
this foible, and cultivate the old gentleman with
all the zeal and veneration, which a regard to his
own character would permit him to pay. This
ta&s;k was the ea&s;ier to one of our young gentle|man's
pliant di&s;po&s;ition, becau&s;e the virtuo&s;o's
behaviour was ab&s;olutely free from that in&s;olent
&s;elf-conceit, which he could not bear without
di&s;gu&s;t: the &s;enior was, on the contrary, mild
and beneficent; and Pickle was rather plea&s;ed
than &s;hocked at this weakne&s;s, becau&s;e it flat|tered
his vanity with the &s;uppo&s;ition of his own
&s;uperior &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Cautioned in this manner, Peregrine profited
&s;o much by his in&s;inuating qualifications, that, in
a very little time, he was looked upon as one of
<PB N="133" REF="139">
the chief favourites of the patron, to whom he
dedicated a &s;mall occa&s;ional poem; and every
body believed he would reap the fruits of his
attachment, among the fir&s;t of the old gentle|man's
dependants.</P>

<DIV2 N="104" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. CIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Peregrine finding him&s;elf neglected by Sir Steady
Steerwell, expo&s;tulates with him in a letter; in
con&s;equence of which, he is forbid his hou&s;e,
$word$ his pen&s;ion, and incurs the reputation of a
$unatick.</HEAD>
<P>THIS pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, together with
his expectations from the mini&s;ter, whom
he did not neglect, helped to comfort him under
the rever&s;e of fortune which he had undergone,
and the uncertainty of the law-&s;uit, which he
&s;till maintained for the recovery of his ten thou|&s;and
pounds. The lawyers, indeed, continued
to drain his pocket of money, while they filled
his brain with un&s;ub&s;tantial hope; and he was
actually obliged to borrow money from his book|&s;eller,
on the &s;trength of the tran&s;lation, in order
to &s;atisfy the demands of tho&s;e ravenous harpies,
rather than lay the mi&s;anthrope under any diffi|culties,
or have recour&s;e to his friend Hatchway,
who lived at the garri&s;on, intirely ignorant of
his di&s;tre&s;s: and this was not at all alleviated by
the arrival of the Indiaman, in which he had
ventured &s;even hundred pounds, as we have al|ready
ob&s;erved; for he was given to under&s;tand,
that the borrower was left dangerou&s;ly ill at
Bombay when the &s;hip &s;ailed, and that his chance
for retrieving his money was extremely &s;lender.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="140">
So &s;ituated, it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that he led
a life of tranquillity, tho' he made a &s;hift to
&s;truggle with the remon&s;trances of misfortune:
yet &s;uch a gu&s;h of affliction would &s;ometimes ru&s;h
upon his thought, as overwhelmed all the ideas
of his hope, and &s;unk him to the very bottom of
de&s;pondence. Every equipage that pa&s;&s;ed him in
the &s;treet, every per&s;on of rank and fortune that
occurred to his view, recalled the gay images of
his former life, with &s;uch mortifying reflection as
&s;tabbed him to the very &s;oul. He lived, there|fore,
ince&s;&s;antly expo&s;ed to all the pangs of envy
and di&s;quiet. When I &s;ay envy, I do not mean
that &s;ordid pa&s;&s;ion, in con&s;equence of which a
man repines at his neighbour's &s;ucce&s;s, how&s;oever
de&s;erved; but that &s;elf-tormenting indignation
which is in&s;pired by the pro&s;perity of folly, igno|rance
and vice. Without the intervening gleams
of enjoyment, which he felt in the conver&s;ation
of a few friends, he could not have &s;upported his
exi&s;tence; or, at lea&s;t, he mu&s;t have &s;uffered
&s;ome violent di&s;compo&s;ure of the brain: but one
is &s;till finding &s;ome circum&s;tance of alleviation,
even in the wor&s;t of conjunctures; and Pickle
was &s;o ingenious in the&s;e re&s;earches, that he
maintained a good battle with di&s;appointment,
till the revolution of the term at which he had
received his pen&s;ion of three hundred pounds.</P>
<P>However, &s;eeing the day elap&s;e, without touch|ing
his allowance, notwith&s;tanding his &s;ignificant
method of pre&s;enting him&s;elf at the mini&s;ter's
levee, when the year was expired, he wrote a
letter to Sir Steady, reminding him of his &s;itua|tion
and promi&s;e, and giving him to under&s;tand,
that his occa&s;ions were &s;uch, as compelled him to
demand his &s;alary for the en&s;uing year.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="141">
In the morning after this letter was conveyed,
the author went to his honour's hou&s;e, in expec|tation
of being admitted by particular order; but
was mi&s;taken in his hope, the mini&s;ter not being
vi&s;ible. He then made his appearance at the
levee, in hopes of being clo&s;etted; but though
he took all opportunities of watching Sir Steady's
eyes, he could not obtain one glance, and had
the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing him retire, without being
favoured with the lea&s;t notice. The&s;e circum|&s;tances
of wilful neglect were not over and above
agreeable to our hero, who, in the agonies of
vexation and re&s;entment, went home, and com|po&s;ed
a mo&s;t acrimonious remon&s;trance to his ho|nour;
in con&s;equence of which, he was not only
deprived of all preten&s;ions to a private audience,
but expre&s;sly denied admittance on a public day,
by Sir Steady's own order.</P>
<P>This prohibition, which announced his total
ruin, filled him with rage, horror and de&s;pair:
he cur&s;ed the porter who &s;ignified the mini&s;ter's
command, threatening to cha&s;ti&s;e him upon the
&s;pot for his pre&s;umption, and vented the mo&s;t vi|rulent
imprecations upon his ma&s;ter, to the a&s;to|ni&s;hment
of tho&s;e who chanced to enter during
this conference. Having exhau&s;ted him&s;elf in
the&s;e vain exclamations, he returned to his lodg|ings
in a mo&s;t frantic condition, biting his lips &s;o
that the blood ran from his mouth, da&s;hing his
head and fi&s;ts again&s;t the &s;ides of his chimney,
and weeping with the mo&s;t bitter expre&s;&s;ions of
woe.</P>
<P>Pipes, who&s;e perception had been ju&s;t &s;uffi|cient
to let him &s;ee, that there was &s;ome difference
between the pre&s;ent and former &s;ituation of his
ma&s;ter, over-hearing his tran&s;ports, e&s;&s;ayed to
<PB N="136" REF="142">
enter his apartment, with a view of admini&s;tring
con&s;olation; and finding the door locked on the
in&s;ide, de&s;ired admittance, prote&s;ting, that other|wi&s;e
he would down with the bulk-head, in the
turning of an hand-&s;pike. Peregrine ordered him
to retire, on pain of his di&s;plea&s;ure, and &s;wore,
that if he &s;hould offer to break open the door,
he would in&s;tantly &s;hoot him through the head.
Tom, without paying the lea&s;t regard to this
injunction, &s;et him&s;elf at work immediately;
and his ma&s;ter, exa&s;perated at his want of reve|rence
and re&s;pect, which, in his pre&s;ent paroxy&s;m,
appeared with the mo&s;t provoking aggravation,
flew into his clo&s;et, and &s;natching up one of his
pi&s;tols already loaded, no &s;ooner &s;aw his valet
enter the apartment, in con&s;equence of having
forced the lock, than he pre&s;ented full at his
face, and drew the trigger, but happily the pri|ming
fla&s;hed in the pan, without communicating
with the charge; &s;o that his furious purpo&s;e did
not take effect upon the countenance of hone&s;t
Pipes, who di&s;regardful of the attempt, though
he knew the contents of the piece, a&s;ked, with|out
the lea&s;t alteration of feature, if it mu&s;t be
foul weather through the whole voyage.</P>
<P>Peregrine, mad as he was, repented of his
mi&s;chievous intent again&s;t &s;uch a faithful ad|herent,
in the very moment of execution; and
had it proved fatal, according to the de&s;ign, in
all probability he would have applied another to
his own head. There are certain con&s;iderations
that &s;trike upon the mind with irre&s;i&s;tible force,
even in the mid&s;t of its di&s;traction; the momen|tary
recollection of &s;ome particular &s;cene, occa|&s;ioned
by the features of the devoted victim,
<PB N="137" REF="143">
hath often &s;truck the dagger from the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in's
hand. By &s;uch an impul&s;e was Pipes protected
from any repeated effort of his ma&s;ter's rage;
the friendly cau&s;e of his pre&s;ent di&s;obedience
fla&s;hed upon the conviction of Peregrine, when
he beheld the rugged front of his valet, in which
al&s;o &s;tood di&s;clo&s;ed his long and faithful &s;ervice,
together with the recommendation of the de|cea&s;ed
commodore.</P>
<P>Though his wrath was immediately &s;uppre&s;&s;ed,
and his heart torn with remor&s;e for what he had
done, his brows remained &s;till contracted; and
darting a mo&s;t ferocious regard at the intruder,
&startq;Villain! (&s;aid he) how dare you treat me
with &s;uch di&s;re&s;pect?&endq; &startq;Why &s;houldn't I lend
a hand for the pre&s;ervation of the &s;hip, (an&s;wered
the unruffled Pipes) when there is more &s;ail than
balla&s;t aboard, and the pilot quits the helm in de|&s;pair?
What &s;ignifies one or two broken voyages,
&s;o long as our timbers are &s;trong, and our ve&s;&s;el
in good trim: if &s;he lo&s;es upon one tack, mayhap
&s;he may gain upon another; and I'll be damn'd,
if one day or other we don't fetch up our lee|way:
as for the matter of provi&s;ion, you have
&s;tarted a pretty good &s;tock of money into my
hold, and you are welcome to hoi&s;t it up again
when you wool?&endq;</P>
<P>Here Tom was interrupted by the arrival of
Mr. Crabtree, who &s;eeing Peregrine with a pi&s;tol
in his hand, and &s;uch wild di&s;order in his looks,
his head, hands and mouth be&s;meared with blood,
and, moreover, &s;melling the gunpowder which
had been burnt, actually believed he had either
committed, or was bent upon murder, and, ac|cordingly,
retreated down &s;tairs with infinite di&s;|patch;
though all his &s;peed could not convey
<PB N="138" REF="144">
him without the reach of Pipes, who overtaking
him in the pa&s;&s;age, carried him back into his
ma&s;ter's apartment, ob&s;erving by the way, that
this was no time to &s;heer off, when his confort
&s;tood in need of his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>There was &s;omething &s;o ruefully &s;evere in the
countenance of Cadwallader, thus compelled, that
at any other time, our hero would have laughed
at his concern; but at pre&s;ent, there was no|thing
ri&s;ible in his di&s;po&s;ition: he had, however,
laid a&s;ide his pi&s;tol, and endeavoured, though in
vain, to compo&s;e his internal di&s;turbance; for he
could not utter one &s;yllable to the Mi&s;anthrope,
but &s;tood &s;taring at him in &s;ilence, with a mo&s;t
delirious a&s;pect, which did not tend to di&s;pel the
di&s;may of his friend, who, after &s;ome recollec|tion,
&startq;I wonder, (&s;aid he) that you have never
killed your man before. Pray, how may you
have di&s;po&s;ed of the body?&endq; Pickle having re|covered
the faculty of &s;peech, ordered his lacquey
out of the room, and in a mo&s;t incoherent de|tail,
made Crabtree acquainted with the perfi|dious
conduct of the mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>The confident was very glad to find his fears
di&s;appointed; for he had really concluded, that
&s;ome life was lo&s;t: and perceiving the youth
too much agitated to be treated by him in his
u&s;ual &s;tile, he owned that Sir Steady was a ra&s;cal,
encouraged Pickle with the hope of being one day
able to make repri&s;als upon him; in the mean time,
offered him money for his immediate occa&s;ions,
exhorted him to exert his own qualifications in
rendering him&s;elf independent of &s;uch mi&s;creants,
and finally, coun&s;elled him to repre&s;ent his wrongs
to the nobleman whom he had formerly obliged,
with a view of intere&s;ting that peer in his behalf,
<PB N="139" REF="145">
or at lea&s;t of obtaining a &s;atisfactory explanation
from the mini&s;ter, that he might take no prema|ture
mea&s;ures of revenge.</P>
<P>The&s;e admonitions were &s;o much milder, and
more agreeable than our hero expected from the
Mi&s;anthrope, that they had a very favourable ef|fect
upon his tran&s;ports, which gradually &s;ub|&s;ided,
until he became &s;o tractable, as to promi&s;e
that he would conform to his advice; in con&s;e|quence
of which, he next morning waited upon
his lord&s;hip, who received him very politely, as
u&s;ual, and with great patience heard his com|plaint,
which, by the bye, he could not repeat
without &s;ome ha&s;ty ebullitions of pa&s;&s;ionate re|&s;entment.
This peer, after having gently di&s;ap|proved
of the letter of po&s;tulation, which had
produced &s;uch unfortunate effects, kindly under|took
to recommend his ca&s;e to the mini&s;ter, and
actually performed his promi&s;e that &s;ame day,
when Sir Steady informed him, to his utter a&s;to|ni&s;hment,
that the poor young gentleman was
di&s;ordered in his brain, &s;o that he could not po&s;|&s;ibly
be provided for in a place of importance,
with any regard to the &s;ervice; and it could not
be expected that he (Sir Steady) would &s;upport
his extravagance from his own private pur&s;e:
that he had indeed, at the &s;olicitation of a no|bleman
decea&s;ed, made him a pre&s;ent of three
hundred pounds, in con&s;ideration of &s;ome lo&s;s
that he pretended to have &s;u&s;tained in an elec|tion;
but, &s;ince that time, had perceived in
him &s;uch indi&s;putable marks of lunacy, both
by his di&s;tracted letters and per&s;onal behaviour,
as obliged him to give order, that he &s;hould not
be admitted into the hou&s;e. To corroborate this
a&s;&s;ertion, the mini&s;ter actually called in the evi|dence
<PB N="140" REF="146">
of his own porter, and one of the gentlemen
of his hou&s;hold, who had heard the execrations that
e&s;caped our youth, when he fir&s;t found him&s;elf
excluded. In &s;hort, the nobleman was convinced,
that Peregrine was certainly and <HI>bona fide</HI> mad
as a March hare; and, by the help of this inti|mation,
began to recollect &s;ome &s;ymptoms of
di&s;traction which appeared in his la&s;t vi&s;it; he re|membered
a certain incoherence in his &s;peech, a
violence of ge&s;ture and wildne&s;s of look, that
now evidently denoted a di&s;turbed under&s;tanding:
and he determined, for his own credit and &s;ecu|rity,
to di&s;entangle him&s;elf from &s;uch a dangerous
acquaintance.</P>
<P>With this view, he, i$ imitation of Sir Steady,
commanded his gate to $e &s;hut again&s;t our ad|venturer;
&s;o that when he went to know the re|&s;ult
of his lord&s;hip's conference with the mini|&s;ter,
the door was flung in his face, and the ja|nitor
told him through an iron grate, that he
needed not give him&s;elf the trouble of calling
again, for his lord de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed from
&s;eeing him. He &s;poke not a word in an&s;wer to
this declaration, which he immediately imputed
to the ill offices of the mini&s;ter, again&s;t whom he
breathed defiance and revenge, in his way to the
lodgings of Cadwallader; who being made ac|quainted
with the manner of his reception, begg'd
he would de&s;i&s;t from all &s;chemes of vengeance,
until he (Crabtree) &s;hould be able to unrid$$e
the my&s;tery of the whole, which he did not doubt
of unveiling, by means of his acquaintance with
a family, in which his lord&s;hip often &s;pent the
evening at whi&s;t.</P>
<P>It was not long before he had the de&s;ired op|portunity;
the nobleman being under no in|junctions
<PB N="141" REF="147">
or obligation to keep the affair &s;ecret,
di&s;covered the young gentleman's misfortune, by
way of news, to the fir&s;t company in which he
happened to be; and Peregrine's name was not
&s;o ob&s;cure in the fa&s;hionable world, but that his
di&s;order became the general topic of conver&s;ation
for a day; &s;o that his friend &s;oon partook of the
intelligence, and found means to learn the parti|culars
of the mini&s;ter's information, as above
related. Nay, he was in danger of becoming a
pro&s;elyte to Sir Steady's opinion, when he re|called
and compared every circum&s;tance which he
knew of Pickle's impatience and impetuo&s;ity.</P>
<P>Indeed, nothing more ea&s;ily gains credit than
an imputation of madne&s;s fixed upon any per&s;on
what&s;oever: for when the &s;u&s;picion of the world
is rou&s;ed, and its ob&s;ervation once &s;et at work,
the wi&s;e&s;t, the coole&s;t man upon earth, will, by
&s;ome particulars in his behaviour, convict him&s;elf
of the c$arge: every &s;ingularity in his dre&s;s and
manner (and &s;uch are ob&s;ervable in every per&s;on)
that before pa&s;&s;ed unheeded, now ri&s;es up in judg|ment
again&s;t him, with all the exaggeration of
the ob&s;erver's fancy; and the &s;agacious examiner
perceives di&s;traction in every glance of the eye,
turn of the finger, and motion of the head:
when he &s;peaks, there is a &s;trange peculiarity in
his argument and expre&s;&s;ion; when he holds his
tongue, his imagination teems with &s;ome extra|vagant
reverie; his &s;obriety of demeanour is no
other than a lucid interval, and his pa&s;&s;ion mere
delirium.</P>
<P>If people of the mo&s;t &s;edate and in&s;ipid life and
conver&s;ation are &s;ubject to &s;uch critici&s;ms, no
wonder that they &s;hould take place upon a youth
of Peregrine's fiery di&s;po&s;ition, which, on &s;ome
<PB N="142" REF="148">
occa&s;ions, would have actually ju&s;tified any re|marks
of this kind, which his greate&s;t enemies
could make. He was accordingly repre&s;ented as
one of tho&s;e enterprizing Bucks, who, after hav|ing
&s;pent their fortunes in $iot and exce&s;s, are
happily bereft of their under&s;tanding, and con&s;e|quently
in&s;en&s;ible of the want and di&s;grace which
they have intailed upon them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Cadwall$der him&s;elf was &s;o much affected with
the report, that for &s;ome time he he&s;itated in his
deliberations upon our hero, before he could pre|vail
upon him&s;elf to communicate to him the in|formation
he had received, or to treat him in
other re&s;pects as a man of &s;ound intellects&punc; At
length, however, he ventured to make Pickle ac|quainted
with the particulars he had learn'd, im|parting
them with &s;uch caution and circumlocu|tion,
as he thought nece&s;&s;ary to prevent the
young gentleman from tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing all bounds of
temper and moderation: but, for once, he was
agreably deceived in his progno&s;tic. Incen&s;ed as
our hero was at the conduct of the mini&s;ter, he
could not help laughing at the ridiculous a&s;per|&s;ion,
which, he told his friend, he would &s;oon
refute in a manner that &s;hould not be very agree|ab$e
to his calumniator; ob&s;erving that it was a
common practice with this &s;tate pilot, thus to
&s;lander tho&s;e people to whom he lay under obli|gations
which he had no mind to di&s;charge.
&startq;True it is, (&s;aid Peregrine) he has &s;ucceeded
more than once in contrivances of this kind,
having actually reduced divers people of weak
heads to &s;uch extremity of de&s;pair, as hath i&s;&s;ued
in downright di&s;traction, whereby he was rid of
their importunities, and his judgment confirmed
at the &s;ame time: but I have now (thank heaven)
<PB N="143" REF="149">
attained to &s;uch a pitch of philo&s;ophical re|&s;olution,
as will &s;upport me again&s;t all his machi|nations;
and I will forthwith exhibit the mon&s;ter
to the public, in his true lineaments of craft, per|$idy
and ingratitude.&endq;</P>
<P>This indeed was the plan with which Mr.
Pickle had amu&s;ed him&s;elf during the re&s;earches
$word$ Crabtree; and by this time it &s;o effectually
$word$ his imagination, that he believed he
&s;hould be able to bring his adver&s;ary (in &s;pite of
$word$ his power) to his own terms of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion,
by di&s;tingui&s;hing him&s;elf in the li&s;t of tho&s;e who,
at that period, wrote again&s;t the admini&s;tration.
Nor was this &s;cheme &s;o extravagant as it may
&s;eem to be, had not he overlooked one material
circum&s;tance, which Cadwall$der him&s;elf did not
recollect, when he approved of this project.</P>
<P>While he thus meditated vengeance, the fame
of his di&s;order, in due cour&s;e of circulation, reached
the ears of that lady of quality, who&s;e memoirs have
appeared in the third volume of th$&s;e adventures.
The corre&s;pondence with which &s;he had honoured
our hero had been long broke off, for the rea&s;on al|ready
advanced, namely, his dread of being expo&s;ed
to her infatuating charms. He had been candid
enough to make her acquainted with this cau&s;e of
exiling him&s;elf from her pre&s;ence; and the ad|mitted
the prudence of his &s;elf-re&s;traint, although
&s;he could have been very well &s;atisfied with the
continuance of his intimacy and conver&s;ation,
which were not at all beneath the de&s;ire of any
lady in the kingdom. Notwith&s;tanding this in|terruption,
&s;he &s;till retained a friend&s;hip and re|gard
for his character, and felt all the affliction of
a humane heart, at the news of his misfortunes
and deplorable di&s;temper. She had &s;een him
<PB N="144" REF="150">
courted and cultivated in the &s;un-&s;hine of his pro|&s;perity;
but &s;he knew from &s;ad experience, how
all tho&s;e in&s;ect followers &s;hrink away in the winter
of di&s;tre&s;s. Her compa&s;&s;ion repre&s;ented him as
a poor unhappy lunatic, de&s;titute of all the ne|ce&s;&s;aries
of life, dragging about the ruins of hu|man
nature, and exhibiting the &s;pectacle of bla&s;ted
youth, to the &s;corn and abhorrence of his fellow-creatures.
A king with the&s;e charitable con&s;ide|rations,
&s;he found means to learn in what part
of the town he lodged; and laying a&s;ide all &s;u|perfluous
ceremony, went in a hackney-chair to
his door, which was opened by the ever-faithful
Pipes.</P>
<P>Her lady&s;hip immediately recollected the fea|tures
of this tru&s;ty follower, whom &s;he could not
help loving in her heart, for his attachment and
fidelity, which, after &s;he had applauded with a
mo&s;t gracious commendation, &s;he kindly inquired
after the &s;tate of his ma&s;ter's health, and a&s;ked if
he was in a condition to be &s;een.</P>
<P>Tom, who could not &s;uppo&s;e that the vi&s;it of
a fine lady would be unacceptable to a youth or
Peregrine's complexion, made no verbal reply to
the que&s;tion; but beckoning her lady&s;hip with an
arch &s;ignificance of feature, at which &s;he could
not forbear &s;miling, he walked &s;oftly up &s;tairs;
and &s;he, in obedience to the &s;ignal, followed her
guide into the apartment of our hero, whom &s;he
found at a writing-table, in the very act of com|po&s;ing
an eulogium upon his good friend Sir
Steady. The nature of his work had animated
his countenance with an uncommon degree of
vivacity; and being dre&s;&s;ed in a neat di&s;habille,
his figure could not have appeared to more ad|vantage,
in the eye of a per&s;on who de&s;pi&s;ed the
<PB N="145" REF="151">
tin&s;el of unnece&s;&s;ary ornament. She was ex|tremely
well plea&s;ed to &s;ee her expectations &s;o
agreeably di&s;appointed; for, in&s;tead of the &s;qualid
circum&s;tances and wretched looks attending indi|gence
and di&s;traction, every thing was decent and
genteel; and the patient's a&s;pect &s;uch, as be|tokened
internal &s;atisfaction. Hearing the ru&s;tling
of &s;ilk in his room, he lifted up his eyes from the
paper, and &s;eeing her lady&s;hip, was &s;truck with
a&s;toni&s;hment and awe, as at the unexpected ap|parition
of &s;ome &s;upernatural being.</P>
<P>Before he could recollect him&s;elf from his con|fu&s;ion,
which called the blood into his cheeks,
&s;he told him, that, on the &s;trength of old ac|quaintance,
&s;he was come to vi&s;it him, though it
was a long time &s;ince he had given her good rea|&s;on
to believe, he had ab&s;olutely forgot that there
was &s;uch a per&s;on as &s;he in being. After having
made the mo&s;t warm acknowledgments for this
unfore&s;een honour, he a&s;&s;ured her lady&s;hip, that
the &s;ubject of her reproach was not his fault, but
rather his very great misfortune; and that if it
had been in his power to forget her &s;o ea&s;ily, as
&s;he &s;eemed to imagine, he &s;hould never have
given her cau&s;e to tax him with want of duty and
re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Still dubious of his &s;ituation, &s;he began to con|ver&s;e
with him on different &s;ubjects; and he ac|quitted
him&s;elf &s;o well in every particular, that
&s;he no longer doubted his having been mi&s;repre|&s;ented
by the malice of his enemies; and can|didly
told him the cau&s;e and intent of her coming.
He was not deficient in expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude
for this in&s;tance of her genero&s;ity and friend&s;hip,
which even drew tears from his eyes; and as to
the imputation of madne&s;s, he explained it &s;o
<PB N="146" REF="152">
much to her lady&s;hip's &s;atisfaction, that &s;he ev|dently
perceived he had been barbarou&s;ly deale
with, and that the charge was no other than a
mo&s;t villainous a&s;per&s;ion.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all his endeavours to conceal
the true &s;tate of his finances, it was impo&s;&s;ible
for him to give this detail, without di&s;clo&s;ing
&s;ome of the difficulties under which he laboured;
and her lady&s;hip's &s;agacity divining the re&s;t, &s;he
not only made him a tender of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but
pre&s;enting a bank-note for a con&s;iderable &s;um,
in&s;i&s;ted upon his acceptance of it, as a trifling
mark of her e&s;teem, and a &s;pecimen of what &s;he
was inclined to do in his behalf. But this mark
of her benevolence he would by no means re|ceive;
a&s;&s;uring her, that though his affairs were
at pre&s;ent a little perplexed, he had never felt
the lea&s;t circum&s;tance of di&s;tre&s;s, and begging that
&s;he would not &s;ubject him to the burthen of &s;uch
an unnece&s;&s;ary obligation.</P>
<P>Being obliged to put up with this refu&s;al, &s;he
prote&s;ted &s;he would never forgive him, &s;hould
&s;he ever hear that he rejected her offer, when he
&s;tood in need of her aid; or if in time to come,
he &s;hould not apply to her friend&s;hip, if ever $e
&s;hould find him&s;elf incommoded in point of for|tune:
&startq;An over-delicacy in this re&s;pect (&s;aid
&s;he) I &s;hall look upon as a di&s;approbation of my
own conduct; becau&s;e I my&s;elf have been ob|liged
to have recour&s;e to my friends, in &s;uch
emergencies.&endq;</P>
<P>The&s;e generous remon&s;trances and marks of
particular friend&s;hip, could not fail to make deep
impre&s;&s;ion upon the heart of our hero, which &s;til
&s;marted from the former impul&s;e of her charmes
he not only felt all tho&s;e tran&s;ports which a man
<PB N="147" REF="153">
of honour and &s;en&s;ibility may be &s;uppo&s;ed to feel
upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion, but the &s;entiments of a
more tender pa&s;&s;ion awaking in his brea&s;t, he
could not help expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf in terms adapted
to the emotions of his &s;oul; and at length plainly
told her, that were he di&s;po&s;ed to be a beggar,
he would a&s;k &s;omething of infinitely more im|portance
to his peace, than the charitable a&s;&s;i&s;tance
&s;ae had proffered.</P>
<P>Her lady&s;hip had too much penetration to
mi&s;take his meaning; but as &s;he did not chu&s;e to
encourage his advances, pretended to interpret
his intimation into a general compliment of gal|lantry,
and in a joco&s;e manner, de&s;ired he would
not give her any rea&s;on to believe his lucid in|terval
was pa&s;t. &startq;In faith, my lady, (&s;aid he)
I perceive the fit coming on; and I don't &s;ee
why I may not u&s;e the privilege of my di|&s;temper,
&s;o far as to declare my&s;elf one of your
mu&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate admirers.&endq; &startq;If you do, (re|pled
her lady&s;hip) I &s;hall not be fool enough to
$word$ a madman, unle&s;s I were a&s;&s;ured that your
$word$ proceeded from your love: and that this
was the ca&s;e, I &s;uppo&s;e you would find it difficult
to prove.&endq; &startq;Nay, Madam, (cried the youth)
I have in this drawer, what will convince you of
$word$ having been mad on that &s;train; and &s;ince
you doubt my preten&s;ions, you mu&s;t give me
leave to produce my te&s;timonials.&endq; So &s;aying,
he opened a &s;crutore, and taking out a paper,
pre&s;ented her with the following &s;ong, which he
had written in her prai&s;e, immediately after he
was made acquainted with the particulars of her

<P>Her lady&s;hip having peru&s;ed this production,

Corpus into the Fleet.</HEAD>
<P><HI>MY lady having prolonged her</HI> &s;tay beyond
the period of a common vi&s;it, and re|peated
her prote&s;tations in the mo&s;t frank and
obliging manner, took her leave of our adven|turer,
who promi&s;ed to pay his re&s;pects to her in
a few days, at her own hou&s;e. Mean while, he
re&s;umed his ta&s;k; and having fini&s;hed a mo&s;t &s;e|vere
remon&s;trance again&s;t Sir Steady, not only
with regard to his private ingratitude, but al&s;o
to his male-admini&s;tration of public affairs, he
&s;ent it to the author of a weekly paper, who had
been long a profe&s;&s;ed reformer in politics; and it
appeared in a very few days, with a note of the
publi&s;her, de&s;iring the favour of a further corre|&s;pondence
with the author.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="156">
The animadver&s;ions contained in this &s;mall e&s;|&s;ay
were &s;o &s;pirited and judicious, and a great
many new lights thrown upon the &s;ubject with
&s;uch per&s;picuity, as attracted the notice of the
public in an extraordinary manner, and helped
to rai&s;e the character of the paper in which it
was in&s;erted. The mini&s;ter was not the la&s;t who
examined the performance, which, in &s;pite of
all his boa&s;ted temper, provoked him to &s;uch a
degree, that he &s;et his emi&s;&s;aries at work, and
by dint of corruption, procured a &s;ight of the
manu&s;cript in Peregrine's own hand-writing,
which he immediately recognized; and, for fur|ther
confirmation of his opinion, compared with
the two letters which he had received from our
adventurer. Had he known the young gentle|man's
talents for declamation were &s;o acute, per|haps
he would never have given him cau&s;e to
complain, but employed him in the vindication of
his own mea&s;ures; nay, he might &s;till have treated
him like &s;ome other authors whom he had brought
over from the oppo&s;ition, had not the keenne&s;s of
this fir&s;t a&s;&s;ault incen&s;ed him to a de&s;ire of re|venge.
He, therefore, no &s;ooner made this di&s;|covery,
than he conveyed his directions to his
dependant the receiver general, who was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of Pickle's notes; and next day, while our au|thor
&s;tood within a circle of his acquaintance, at
a certain coffee-hou&s;e, holding forth with great
eloquence upon the di&s;ea&s;es of the &s;tate, he was
acco&s;ted by a bailiff, who entering the room with
five or &s;ix followers, told him aloud, that he had
a writ again&s;t him for twelve hundred pounds, at
the &s;uit of Mr. Ravage Gleanum.</P>
<P>The whole company were a&s;toni&s;hed at this
addre&s;s, which did not fail to di&s;compo&s;e the
<PB N="151" REF="157">
de&s;endant him&s;elf, who (as it were in&s;tinctively)
in the mid&s;t of his confu&s;ion, &s;aluted the officer
acro&s;s the head with his cane; in con&s;equence of
which application, he was &s;urrounded and di&s;|armed
in an in&s;tant by the gang, who carried him
off to the next tavern in the mo&s;t opprobrious
manner. Nor did one of the &s;pectators inter|po&s;e
in his behalf, or vi&s;it him in his confinement
with the lea&s;t tender of advice or a&s;&s;i&s;tance; &s;uch
is the zeal of a coffee-hou&s;e friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>This &s;troke was the more &s;evere upon our
hero, as it was altogether unexpected; for he
had utterly forgot the debt for which he was ar|re&s;ted.
His pre&s;ent indignation was, however,
chiefly kindled again&s;t the bailiff, who had done
his office in &s;uch a di&s;re&s;pectful manner: and the
fir&s;t u&s;e he made of his recollection in the hou&s;e
to which they conducted him, was to cha&s;ti&s;e
him for the in&s;olence and indecency of his beha|viour.
This ta&s;k he performed with his bare fi$$s,
every other weapon being previou&s;ly conveyed
out of his reach; and the delinquent under|went
his di&s;cipline with &s;urpri&s;ing patience and
re&s;ignation, a&s;king pardon with great humility,
and prote&s;ting before God, that he had never
will ngly and wittingly u&s;ed any gentleman with
$word$ manners, but had been commanded to arre&s;t
our adventurer according to the expre&s;s direction
$word$ the creditor, on pain of forfeiding his place.</P>
<P>By this declaration Peregrine was appea&s;ed,
and out of a delirium of pa&s;&s;ion, waked to all
the horrors of reflection. All the glory of his
$word$ was now eclip&s;ed, all the blo&s;&s;oms of his
hope were bla&s;ted, and he &s;aw him&s;elf doomed
to the mi&s;eries of a jail, without the lea&s;t pro|&s;pect
of enlargement, except in the i&s;&s;ue of his
<PB N="152" REF="158">
law-&s;uit, of which he had, for &s;ome time pa&s;t,
grown le&s;s and le&s;s confident every day. What
would become of the unfortunate, if the con&s;ti|tution
of the mind did not permit them to
bring one pa&s;&s;ion into the field again&s;t another
pa&s;&s;ions that operate in the human brea&s;t, like
poi&s;ons of a different nature, extingui&s;hing each
other's effect. Our hero's grief reigned in full
de&s;poti&s;m, until it was depo&s;ed by revenge;
during the predominancy of which, he con&s;i|dered
every thing which had happened as a cir|cum&s;tance
conducive to its gratification: &startq;If I
mu&s;t be pri&s;oner for life, (&s;aid he to him&s;elf) if I
mu&s;t relinqui&s;h all my gay expectations, let me at
lea&s;t have the &s;atisfaction of clanking my chains
&s;o as to interrupt the repo&s;e of my adver&s;ary;
and let me &s;earch in my own brea&s;t for that
peace and contentment, which I have not been
able to find in all the &s;cenes of my &s;ucce&s;s. In
being detached from the world, I &s;hall be deli|vered
from folly and ingratitude, as well as ex|empted
from an expence, which I &s;hould have
found it very difficult, if not impracticable, to
&s;upport; I &s;hall have little or no temptation to
mi&s;pend my time, and more undi&s;turbed oppor|tunity
to earn my &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and pro&s;ecute my
revenge. After all, a jail is the be&s;t tub to
which a cynic philo&s;opher can retire.&endq;</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the&s;e comfortable reflec|tions,
he &s;ent a letter to Mr. Crabtree, with an
account of his misfortune, &s;ignifying his re&s;olu|tion
to move him&s;elf immediately into the Fleet,
and de&s;iring that he would &s;end him &s;ome un|der&s;tanding
attorney of his acquaintance, who
would direct him in the &s;teps nece&s;&s;ary to be
taken for that purpo&s;e. The Mi&s;anthrope, upon
<PB N="153" REF="159">
the receit of this intimation, went in per&s;on to
a lawyer, whom he accompanied to the &s;punging|hou&s;e,
whither the pri&s;oner had by this time re|tired;
and Peregrine was, under the au&s;pices of
this director, conducted to the judge's chamber,
where he was left in the cu&s;tody of a tip&s;taff;
and after having paid for a warrant of <HI>Habeas
Corpus,</HI> by him conveyed to the Fleet, and de|livered
to the care of the warden.</P>
<P>Here he was introduced to the lodge, in which
he was obliged to expo&s;e him&s;elf a full half hour
to the eyes of all the turnkeys and door-keepers,
who took an accurate &s;urvey of his per&s;on, that
they might know him again at fir&s;t fight; and
then he was turned loo&s;e into the place called the
ma&s;ter's &s;ide, having given a valuable con&s;idera|tion
for that privilege. This is a large range of
building, containing &s;ome hundreds of lodging-rooms
for the convenience of the pri&s;oners, who
pay &s;o much <HI>per</HI> week for that accommodation.
In &s;hort, this community is like a city detached
from all communication with the neighbouring
parts, regulated by its own laws, and furni&s;hed
with peculiar conveniences, for the u&s;e of the
inhabitants. There is a coffee-hou&s;e for the re|fort
of gentlemen, in which all &s;orts of liquors
are kept, and a public kitchen, where any quan|tity
of meat is &s;old at a very rea&s;onable rate, or
any kind of provi&s;ion boiled and roa&s;ted <HI>gratis,</HI>
for the poor pri&s;oners: nay, there are certain
&s;ervants of the public, who are obliged to go to
market, at the plea&s;ure of individuals, without
fee or reward from tho&s;e who employ them: nor
are they cooped up, &s;o as to be excluded from
the benefit of fre&s;h air, there being an open area
of a con&s;iderable extent adjacent to the building,
<PB N="154" REF="160">
on which they may exerci&s;e them&s;elves in walk|ing,
&s;kittles, bowls, and variety of other diver|&s;ions,
according to the inclination of each.</P>
<P>Our adventurer being admitted a denizen of
this community, found him&s;elf bewildered in the
mid&s;t of &s;trangers, who, by their appearance,
did not at all prepo&s;&s;e&s;s him in their favour; and
after having &s;trolled about the place with his
friend Cadwallader, repaired to the coffee-hou&s;e,
in order to be farther informed of the peculiar
cu&s;toms which it was nece&s;&s;ary for him to know.</P>
<P>There, while he endeavoured to pick up in|telligence
from the bar-keeper, he was acco$ted
by a per&s;on in canonicals, who very civilly a&s;k|ing
if he was a new-comer, and being an&s;wered
in the affirmative, gave him the &s;alutation of
welcome to the &s;ociety, and, with great ho&s;pi|tality,
undertook to initiate him in the con&s;titu|tions
of the brotherhood. This humane clergy|man
gave him to under&s;tand, that his fir&s;t care
ought to be that of &s;ecuring a lodging; telling
him, there was a certain number of apartments
in the pri&s;on let at the &s;ame price, though &s;ome
were more commodious than others; and that
when the better &s;ort became vacant, by the re|moval
of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, tho&s;e who &s;ucceeded in
point of &s;eniority, had the privilege of occupying
the empty tenements, preferable to the re&s;t of
the inhabitants, how&s;oever re&s;pectable they might
otherwi&s;e be: that when the jail was very
much crowded, there was but one chamber al|lotted
for two lodgers; but this was not con|&s;idered
as any great hard&s;hip on the pri&s;oners,
becau&s;e, in that ca&s;e, there was always a &s;uffi|cient
number of males, who willingly admitted
the females to a &s;hare of their apartments and beds:
<PB N="155" REF="161">
not but the time had been, when this expedient
would not an&s;wer the occa&s;ion, becau&s;e, after a
couple had been quartered in every room, there
was a con&s;iderable re&s;idue &s;till unprovided with
lodging; &s;o that for the time being, the la&s;t
comers were obliged to take up their habitation
in Mount Scoundrel, an apartment mo&s;t mi|&s;erebly
furni&s;hed, in which they lay promi&s;cuou&s;ly
amid&s;t filth and vermin, until they could be bet|ter
accommodated in due cour&s;e of rotation.</P>
<P>Peregrine hearing the de&s;cription of this place,
began to be very impatient about his night's $word$;
and the par&s;on perceiving his anxiety, con|ducted
him, without lo&s;s of time, to the warden,
who forthwith put him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a paultry
chamber, for which he agreed to pay half a crown
a week. This point being &s;ettled, his director
gave him an account of the different methods of
$word$, either &s;ingly, in a me&s;s, or at an ordi|nary;
and advi&s;ed him to chu&s;e the la&s;t, as the
mo&s;t reputable, offering to introduce him next
day to the be&s;t company in the Fleet, who always
$word$ together in public.</P>
<P>Pickle having thanked this gentleman for his
civilities, and promi&s;ed to be governed by his ad|vice,
invited him to pa&s;s the evening at his apart|ment;
and in the mean time, &s;hut him&s;elf up
with Crabtree, in order to deliberate upon the
wreck of his affairs. Of all his ample fortune,
nothing now remained but his wardrobe, which
was not very &s;umptuous, about thirty guineas in
ca&s;h, and the gari&s;on, which the Mi&s;anthrope
coun&s;elled him to convert into ready money, for
his pre&s;ent &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. This advice, however,
he ab&s;olutely rejected, not only on account of
his having already be&s;towed it upon Hatchway,
<PB N="156" REF="162">
during the term of his natural life, but al&s;o with
a view of retaining &s;ome memorial of the com|modore's
genero&s;ity. He propo&s;ed, therefore,
to fini&s;h in this retreat the tran&s;lation which he
had undertaken, and earn his future &s;ub&s;i&s;tence
by labour of the &s;ame kind. He de&s;ired Cad|wallader
to take charge of his moveables, and
&s;end to him &s;uch linen and cloaths as he &s;hould
have occa&s;ion for in his confinement. But,
among all his difficulties, nothing embara&s;&s;ed him
&s;o much as his faithful Pipes, whom he could no
longer entertain in his &s;ervice. He knew Tom
had made &s;hift to pick up a competency in the
cour&s;e of his mini&s;tration; but that reflection,
though it in &s;ome mea&s;ure alleviated, could not
wholly prevent the mortification he mu&s;t &s;uffer in
parting with an affectionate adherent, who was
by this time become as nece&s;&s;ary to him as one
of his own members, and who was &s;o accu&s;tomed
to live under his command and protection, that
he did not believe the fellow could reconcile him|&s;elf
to any other way of life.</P>
<P>Crabtree, in order to make him&s;elf ea&s;y on
that &s;core, offered to adopt him in the room of
his own valet, whom he would di&s;mi&s;s; though
he ob&s;erved, that Pipes had been quite &s;poiled in
our hero's &s;ervice. But Peregrine did not chu&s;e
to lay his friend under that inconvenience, know|ing
that his pre&s;ent lacquey under&s;tood and com|plied
with all the peculiarities of his humour,
which Pipes would never be able to &s;tudy or re|gard;
and therefore determined to &s;end him back
to his &s;hip-mate Hatchway, with whom he has
&s;pent the fore-part of his life.</P>
<P>The&s;e points being adju&s;ted, the two friends
adjourned to the coffee-hou&s;e, with a view of in|quiring
<PB N="157" REF="163">
into the character of the clergyman, to
who&s;e beneficence our adventurer was &s;o much
indebted; and they learned he was a per&s;on who
had incurred the di&s;plea&s;ure of the bi&s;hop in who&s;e
dioce&s;e he was &s;ettled, and, being unequal in
power to his antagoni&s;t, had been driven to the
Fleet, in con&s;equence of his ob&s;tinate oppo&s;ition;
tho' he &s;till found means to enjoy a pretty con&s;i|derable
income, by certain irregular practices in
the way of his function, which income was chiefly
con&s;umed in acts of humanity to his fellow-crea|tures
in di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>His eulogium was &s;carce fini&s;hed, when he en|tered
the room, according to appointment with
Peregrine, who ordering wine and &s;omething for
&s;upper to be carried to his apartment, the trium|virate
went thither; and Cadwallader taking his
leave for the night, the two fellow-pri&s;oners
pa&s;&s;ed the evening very &s;ociably, our hero being
entertained by his new companion with the pri|vate
hi&s;tory of the place, &s;ome particulars of
which were extremely curious. He told him,
that the per&s;on who attended them at &s;upper,
bowing with the mo&s;t abject &s;ervility, and wor|&s;hipping
them, every time he opened his mouth,
with the epithets of <HI>your Lord&s;hip</HI> and <HI>your Honour,</HI>
had, a few years before, been actually a captain
in the guards; who, after having run his career
in the great world, had threaded every &s;tation in
their community, from that of a buck of the
fir&s;t order, who &s;waggers about the Fleet in a
laced coat, with a footman and whore, to the
degree of a tap&s;ter, in which he was n$w hap|pily
&s;ettled. &startq;If you will take the trouble of
going into the cook's kitchen (&s;aid he), you will
perceive a beau metamorpho&s;ed into a turn-&s;pit;
<PB N="158" REF="164">
and there are &s;ome hewers of wood and drawers
of water in this microco&s;m, who have had fore&s;ts
and fi&s;h-ponds of their own: yet, notwith&s;tand|ing
&s;uch a mi&s;erable rever&s;e of fortune, they are
neither objects of regard or compa&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e
their misfortunes are the fruits of the mo&s;t vici|ous
extravagance, and they are ab&s;olutely in&s;en|&s;ible
of the mi&s;ery which is their lot. Tho&s;e of
our fellow-&s;ufferers, who have been reduced by
unde&s;erved lo&s;&s;es, or the precipitation of unex|perienced
youth, never fail to meet with the mo&s;t
brotherly a&s;&s;i&s;tance, provided they behave with
decorum, and a due &s;en&s;e of their unhappy cir|cum&s;tances.
Nor are we de&s;titute of power to
cha&s;ti&s;e the licentious, who refu&s;e to comply with
the regulations of the place, and di&s;turb the peace
of the community, with riot and di&s;order.
Ju&s;tice is here impartially admini&s;tered, by a
court of equity, con&s;i&s;ting of a &s;elect number of
the mo&s;t re&s;pectable inhabitants, who puni&s;h all
offenders with equal judgment and re&s;olution,
after they have been fairly convicted of the
crimes laid to their charge.&endq;</P>
<P>The clergyman having thus explained the
oeconomy of the place, as well as the cau&s;e of
his own confinement, began to di&s;cover &s;igns of
curio&s;ity, touching our hero's &s;ituation; and
Pickle, thinking he could do no le&s;s for the &s;ati&s;|faction
of a man, who had treated him in &s;uch an
ho&s;pitable manner, favoured him with a detail o$
the circum&s;tances which produced his impri&s;on|ment:
at the &s;ame time, gratifying his re&s;ent|ment
again&s;t the mini&s;ter, which delighted in
recapitulating the injuries he had received. The
par&s;on, who had been prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in favour of
our youth at fir&s;t &s;ight, under&s;tanding what a
<PB N="159" REF="165">
con&s;iderable part he had acted on the &s;tage of
life, felt his veneration increa&s;e; and, plea&s;ed
with the opportunity of introducing a &s;tranger of
his con&s;equence to the club, left him to his re|po&s;e,
or rather to ruminate on an event which
he had not as yet &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idered.</P>
<P>I might here, in imitation of &s;ome celebrated
writers, furni&s;h out a page or two, with the re|flections
he made upon the in&s;tability of human
affairs, the treachery of the world, and the teme|rity
of youth; and endeavour to decoy the
reader into a &s;mile, by &s;ome quaint ob&s;ervation
of my own, touching the &s;agacious moralizer:
but, be&s;ides that I look upon this practice as an
impertinent anticipation of the peru&s;er's thoughts,
I have too much matter of importance upon my
hands, to give the reader the lea&s;t rea&s;on to
believe that I am driven to &s;uch paultry &s;hifts, in
order to eke out the volume. Suffice it then, to
&s;ay, our adventurer pa&s;&s;ed a very unea&s;y night,
not only from the thorny &s;ugge&s;tions of his mind,
but likewi&s;e from the angui&s;h of his body, which
&s;uffered from the hardne&s;s of his couch, as well
as from the natural inhabitants thereof, which
did not tamely &s;uffer his intru&s;ion.</P>
<P>In the morning he was waked by Pipes, who
brought upon his &s;houlder a portmanteau fi$led
with nece&s;&s;aries, according to the direction of
Cadwallader; and to&s;&s;ing it down upon the floor,
regaled him&s;elf with a quid, without the lea&s;t
manife&s;tation of concern. After &s;ome pau&s;e,
&startq;You &s;ee, Pipes, (&s;aid his ma&s;ter) to what I
have brought my&s;elf.&endq; &startq;Ey, ey, (an&s;wered
the valet) once the ve&s;&s;el is a&s;hore, what &s;ignifies
talking? We mu&s;t bear a hand to tow her off,
if we can: if &s;he won't budge for all the anchors
<PB N="160" REF="166">
and cap&s;tans aboard, after we have lightened her,
by cutting away her ma&s;ts, and heaving our guns
and cargo overboard, why then, mayhap, a bri&s;k
gale of wind, a tide, or current &s;etting from
&s;hore, may float her again in the bla&s;t of a
whi&s;tle. Here is two hundred and ten guineas
by the tale, in this here canvas-bag; and upon
this &s;crap of paper&mdash;no, ava&s;t&mdash;that's my di&s;|charge
from the pari&s;h for Moll Trundle&mdash;ey,
here it is&mdash;an order for thirty pounds upon the
what-d'ye-call-'em in the city; and two tickets
for twenty-five and eighteen, which I lent, d'ye
&s;ee to Sam Studding to buy a cargo of rum,
when he hoi&s;ted the &s;ign of the Commodore at
St. Catharine's.&endq; So &s;aying, he &s;pread his whole
&s;tock upon the table, for the acceptance of Pere|grine;
who, being very much affected with this
fre&s;h in&s;tance of his attachment, expre&s;&s;ed his
&s;atisfaction at &s;eeing he had been &s;uch a good
oeconomi&s;t, paid his wages up to that very day,
thanked him for his faithful &s;ervices, and, ob|&s;erving
that he him&s;elf was no longer in a condi|tion
to maintain a dome&s;tick, advi&s;ed him to re|tire
to the gari&s;on, where he would be kindly
received by his friend Hatchway, to whom he
would recommend him in the &s;tronge&s;t terms.</P>
<P>Pipes looked blank at this unexpected intima|tion,
to which he replied, that he wanted neither
pay nor provi&s;ion, but only to be employed as a
tender; and that he would not &s;teer his cour&s;e for
the gari&s;on, unle&s;s his ma&s;ter would fir&s;t take
his lumber aboard. Pickle, however, perempto|rily
refu&s;ed to touch a farthing of the money,
which he commanded him to put up; and Pipes
was &s;o mortified at his refu&s;al, that, twi&s;ting the
notes together, he threw them into the fire with|out
<PB N="161" REF="167">
he&s;itation, crying, &startq;Damn the money!&endq;
and the canvas-bag, with its contents, would
have &s;hared the &s;ame fate, had not Peregrine
&s;tarted up, and &s;natching the paper from the
flames, ordered his valet to forbear, on pain of
being bani&s;hed for ever from his &s;ight. He told
him, that, for the pre&s;ent, there was a nece&s;&s;ity
for his being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and he di&s;charged him
accordingly; but if he would go and live quietly
with the lieutenant, he promi&s;ed, on the fir&s;t
favourable turn of his fortune, to take him again
into his &s;ervice. In the mean time he gave him
to under&s;tand, that he neither wanted, nor would
make any u&s;e of his money, which he in&s;i&s;ted
upon his pocketing immediately, on pain of for|$e$ting
all title to his favour.</P>
<P>Pipes was very much chagrined at the&s;e in|junctions,
to which he made no reply; but
&s;weeping the money into his bag, &s;talked off, in
&s;ilence, with a look of grief and mortification,
which his countenance had never exhibited before.
Nor was the proud heart of Pickle unmoved
upon this occa&s;ion: he could &s;carce &s;uppre&s;s his
&s;orrow in the pre&s;ence of Pipes, and, &s;oon as he
was gone, it vented it&s;elf in tears.</P>
<P>Having no great plea&s;ure in conver&s;ing with his
own thoughts, he dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with all conve|nient
di&s;patch, being attended by one of the oc|ca&s;ional
valets of the place, who had formerly
been a rich mercer in the city; and this operation
being performed, he went to breakfa&s;t at the
coffee-hou&s;e, where he happened to meet with
his friend the clergyman, and &s;everal per&s;ons of
genteel appearance, to whom the doctor intro|duced
him as a new me&s;s-mate. By the&s;e gen|tlemen
he was conducted to a place, where they
<PB N="162" REF="168">
&s;pent the forenoon in playing at fives, an exer|ci&s;e
in which our hero took &s;ingular delight; and
about one o'clock a court was held, for the trial
of two delinquents, who had tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the
laws of hone&s;ty and good order.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t who appeared at the bar was an at|torney,
accu&s;ed of having picked a gentleman's
pocket of his handkerchief; and the fact being
proved by inconte&s;tible evidence, he received
&s;entence: in con&s;equence of which he was im|mediately
carried to the public pump, and &s;ub|jected
to a &s;evere ca&s;cade of cold water. This
cau&s;e being di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, they proceeded to the trial
of the other offender, who was a lieutenant of a
man of war, indicted for a riot, which he had
committed in company with a female not yet
taken, again&s;t the laws of the place, and the
peace of his fellow-pri&s;oners. The culprit had
been very ob&s;treperous, and ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to
obey the &s;ummons, with many expre&s;&s;ions of
contempt and defiance again&s;t the authority of
the court; upon which the con&s;tables were or|dered
to bring him to the bar, <HI>vi &amp; armis;</HI> and
he was accordingly brought before the judge,
after having made a mo&s;t de&s;perate re&s;i&s;tance with
a hanger, by which one of the officers was dan|gerou&s;ly
wounded. This outrage was &s;uch an
aggravation of his crime, that the court would
not venture to decide upon it, but remitted him
to the &s;entence of the warden; who, by virtue
of his dictatorial power, ordered the rioter to be
loaded with irons, and confined in the &s;trong-room,
which is a di&s;mal dungeon, &s;ituated upon
the &s;ide of the ditch, infe&s;ted with toads and
vermin, &s;urcharged with noi&s;ome damps, and
impervious to the lea&s;t ray of light.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="169">
Ju&s;tice being done upon the criminals, our
adventurer and his company adjourned to the
ordinary, which was kept at the coffee-hou&s;e;
and he found, upon enquiry, that his me&s;s-mates
con&s;i&s;ted of one officer, two under-writers, three
projectors, an alchymi&s;t, an attorney, a par&s;on, a
brace of poets, a bar$net, and a knight of the bath.
The dinner, tho' not &s;umptuous, nor very elegantly
&s;erved up, was neverthele&s;s &s;ub&s;tantial, and pret|ty
well dre&s;&s;ed: the wine was tolerable, and all
the gue&s;ts as chearful as if they had been utter
&s;trangers to calamity; &s;o that our adventurer
began to reli&s;h the company, and mix in the con|ver&s;ation,
with that &s;prightline&s;s and ca&s;e which
were peculiar to his di&s;po&s;ition. The repa&s;t
being ended, the reckoning paid, and part of the
gentlemen withdrawn to cards, or other avoca|tions,
tho&s;e who remained, among whom Pere|grine
made one, agreed to &s;pend the afternoon in
conver&s;ation over a bowl of punch; and the
liquor being produced, they pa&s;&s;ed the time very
&s;ocially in various topicks of di&s;cour&s;e, including
many curious anecdotes relating to their own
affairs. No man &s;crupled to own the nature of
the debt for which he was confined, unle&s;s it
happened to be &s;ome piddling affair; but, on the
contrary, boa&s;ted of the importance of the &s;um,
as a circum&s;tance that implied his having been a
per&s;on of con&s;equence in life; and he who had
made the mo&s;t remarkable e&s;capes from bailiffs,
was looked upon as a man of &s;uperior genius and
addre&s;s.</P>
<P>Among other extraordinary adventures of this
kind, none was more romantic than the la&s;t
elopement atchieved by the officer; who told
them, he had been arre&s;ted for a debt of two
<PB N="164" REF="170">
hundred pounds, at a time when he could not
command as many pence, and conveyed to the
bailiff's hou&s;e, in which he continued a whole
fortnight, moving his lodgings higher and higher,
from time to time, in proportion to the decay
of his credit; until, from the parlour, he had
made a regular a&s;cent to the garret. There
while he ruminated on his next &s;tep, which would
have been to the Mar&s;hal&s;ea, and &s;aw the night
come on, attended with hunger and cold, the
wind began to blow, and the tiles of the hou&s;e
rattled with the &s;torm: his imagination was im|mediately
&s;truck with the idea of e&s;caping unper|ceived,
amid&s;t the darkne&s;s and noi&s;e of the tem|pe&s;t,
by creeping out at the window of his apart|ment,
and making his way over the tops of the
adjoining hou&s;es. Glow$ng with this pro&s;pect,
he examined the pa&s;&s;age, which, to his infinite
mortification, he found grated with iron-bars on
the out&s;ide; but even this difficulty did not divert
him from his purpo&s;e. Con&s;cious of his own
&s;trength, he believed him&s;elf able to make an
hole thro' the roof, which &s;eemed to be &s;lender
and crazy; and, on this &s;uppo&s;ition, he barri|cadoed
the door with the whole furniture of the
room: then, &s;etting him&s;elf to work with a poker,
he in a few minutes effected a pa&s;&s;age for his
hand, with which he gradually &s;tript off the
boards and tiling, &s;o as to open a &s;ally-port for
his whole body, thro' which he fairly &s;et him&s;elf
tree, groping his way towards the next tenement.
Here, however, he met with an unlucky acci|dent:
his hat, being blown off his head, chanced
to tumble into the court, ju&s;t as one of the bai|liff's
followers was knocking at the door; and
this myrmidon recognizing it immediately, gave
<PB N="165" REF="171">
the alarm to his chief, who, running up &s;tairs to
the garret, forced open the door in a twinkling,
notwith&s;tanding the precautions which the pri|&s;oner
had taken, and, with his attendant, pur&s;ued
the fugitive thro' his own track. &startq;After this
chace had continued &s;ome time, (&s;aid the officer)
to the imminent danger of all three, I found my
progre&s;s &s;uddenly &s;topt by a &s;ky-light, through
which I perceived &s;even taylors, &s;itting at work
upon a board. Without the lea&s;t he&s;itation or
previous notice, I plunged among them, with my
back&s;ide foremo&s;t; and, before they could recol|lect
them&s;elves from the con&s;ternation occa&s;ioned
by &s;uch a &s;trange vi&s;it, told them my &s;ituation,
and gave them to under&s;tand that there was no
time to be lo&s;t. One of the number, taking the
hint, led me in&s;tantly down &s;tairs, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed
me at the &s;treet-door; while the bailiff and his
follower, arriving at the breach, were deterred
from entering by the brethren of my deliverer,
who pre&s;enting their &s;hears, like a range of
<HI>ch$$aux de fri&s;e,</HI> commanded them to retire, on
pain of immediate death: and the catchpole, ra|ther
ther than ri&s;que his carca&s;e, con&s;ented to di&s;|charge
the debt, comforting him&s;elf with the
hope of making me pri&s;oner again. There,
however, he was di&s;appointed: I kept &s;nug, and
laughed at his e&s;cape-warrant, until I was or|dered
abroad with the regiment, when I convey'd
my&s;elf in a hear&s;e to Grave&s;end, where I em|barked
for Flanders; but, being obliged to come
over again on the recruiting &s;ervice, I was nabb'd
on another &s;core: and all the &s;atisfaction my fir&s;t
captor has been able to obtain, is a writ of de|tainer;
which, I believe, will fix me in this
place, until the parliament, in its great goodne&s;s,
<PB N="166" REF="172">
&s;hall think proper to di&s;charge my debts, by a
new act of in&s;olvency.&endq;</P>
<P>Every body owned, that the captain's &s;ucce&s;s
was equal to the hardine&s;s of his enterprize,
which was altogether in the $$ile of a &s;oldier: but
one of the merchants ob&s;erved, that he mu&s;t
have been a bailiff of &s;mall experience, who
would tru&s;t a pri&s;oner of that con&s;equence in
&s;uch an unguarded place. &startq;If the captain (&s;aid
he) had fallen into the hands of &s;uch a cunning
ra&s;cal as the fellow that arre&s;ted me, he would
$word$ have found it &s;uch an ea&s;y matter to e&s;cape;
$word$ the manner in which I was caught, is perhaps
the mo&s;t extraordinary that ever was practi&s;ed in
the&s;e realms. You mu&s;t know, gentlemen, I
&s;uffered &s;uch lo&s;&s;es by in&s;$ring ve&s;&s;els, during the
war, that I was obliged to &s;top payment, tho' my
expectations were &s;uch as encouraged me to ma|nage
one branch of bu&s;ine&s;s, without coming to
any immediate compo&s;ition with my creditors.
In &s;hort, I received con&s;ignments from abroad
as u&s;ual; and that I might not be &s;ubject to the
vi&s;its of tho&s;e catchpoles, I never &s;tirred abroad,
but, turning my fir&s;t floor into a warehou&s;e, or|dered
all my goods to be hoi&s;ted up by a crane,
fixed to the upper &s;tory of my hou&s;e. Divers
were the &s;tratagems practi&s;ed by tho&s;e ingenious
ferrets, with a view of decoying me from the
walls of my fortification. I received innumerable
me&s;&s;ages from people, who wanted to &s;ee me at
certain taverns, upon particular bu&s;ine&s;s: I was
&s;ummoned into the country, to &s;ee my own mo|ther,
who was &s;aid to be at the point of death.
A gentlewoman, one night, was taken in labour
on my thre&s;hold: at another time, I was di&s;|turbed
with the cry of murder in the &s;treet; and
<PB N="167" REF="173">
once I was alarmed by a fal&s;e fire. But, being
&s;till upon my guard, I baffled all their attempts,
and thought my&s;elf quite &s;ecure from their inven|tion;
when one of tho&s;e blood-hounds, in&s;pired,
I believe, by the devil him&s;elf, contrived a &s;nare
by which I was at la&s;t entrapped. He made it
his bu&s;ine&s;s to enquire into the particulars of my
traffick; and under&s;tanding that, among other
things, there were &s;everal che&s;ts of Florence en|tered
at the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e on my behalf, he or|dered
him&s;elf to be inclo&s;ed in a box of the &s;ame
dimen&s;ions, with air-holes in the bottom, for the
benefit of breathing, and N$. III. marked
upon the cover; and being conveyed to my door
in a cart, among other goods, was, in his turn,
hoi&s;ted up to my warehou&s;e, where I &s;tood with
a hammer, in order to open the che&s;ts, that I
might compare the contents with the invoice.
You may gue&s;s my &s;urprize and con&s;ternation,
when, upon uncovering the box, I &s;aw a bailiff
rearing up his head, like Lazarus from the grave,
and heard him declare that he had a writ again&s;t
me for a thou&s;and pounds. Indeed, I aimed the
hammer at his head; but, in the hurry of my
confu&s;ion, mi&s;&s;ed my m$rk: and before I could
repeat the blow, he &s;tarted up with great agility,
and executed his office in &s;ight of &s;everal evi|dences,
whom he had a&s;&s;embled in the &s;treet for
that purpo&s;e; &s;o that I could not po&s;&s;ibly di&s;en|tangle
my&s;elf from the toil, without incurring an
e&s;cape-warrant, from which I had no protection.
But, had I known the contents of the che&s;t, by
all that's good! I would have ordered my porter
to rai&s;e it up, as high as the crane would permit,
and then have cut the rope by accident.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="174">
&startq;That expedient, (&s;aid the knight with the
red ribbon) would have di&s;couraged him from
&s;uch hazardous adventures for the future, and
would have been an example <HI>in terrorem</HI> of all
his brethren. The &s;tory puts me in mind of a
d$liverance atchieved by Tom Hackabout, a very
&s;tout hone&s;t fellow, an old acquaintance of mine,
who had been &s;o famous for maiming bailiffs,
that another gentleman having been ill u&s;ed at a
$word$-hou&s;e, no &s;ooner obtained his liberty
than, with a view of being revenged upon the
$word$ he, for five &s;hillings, bought one of
Tom's $word$, which &s;old at a very large di&s;count,
and taking out a writ upon it, put it into the
hands of the bailiff who had u&s;ed him ill. The
$word$, after a diligent &s;earch, had an oppor|tunity
of executing the writ upon the defendant,
who without ceremony, $roke one of his arms,
fractured his &s;kull, and belaboured him in &s;uch a
manner, that he lay without &s;en&s;e and motion on
the &s;pot. By &s;uch exploits, this hero became
$span$ that no &s;ingle bailiff would under|take
to arre&s;t him; &s;o that he appeared in all
public places, untouched. At length, however,
&s;everal officers of the Mar&s;hal&s;ea-court entered
into confederacy again&s;t him; and two of the
number, attended by three de&s;perate followers,
ventured to arre&s;t him one day in the Strand,
near Hungerford-market: he found it impo&s;&s;ible
to make re&s;i&s;tance, becau&s;e the whole gang &s;prung
upon him at once, like &s;o many tygers, and pi|$$ned
his arms &s;o fa&s;t, that he could not wag a
finger. Perceiving him&s;elf fairly overpowered,
he de&s;ired to be conducted forthwith to jail, and
was &s;towed in a boat accordingly: by that time
they had reached the middle of the river, he
<PB N="169" REF="175">
found means to over&s;et the wherry by accident,
and every man di&s;regarding the pri&s;oner, con|&s;ulted
his own &s;afety. As for Hackabout, to
whom that element was quite familiar, he mounted
a&s;tride upon the keel of the boat, which was
uppermo&s;t, and exhorted the bailiffs to &s;wim for
their lives; prote&s;ting, before God, that they had
no other chance to be &s;aved.</P>
<P>The watermen were immediately taken up by
&s;ome of their own friends, who, far from yield|ing
any a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the catch-poles, kept aloof,
and exulted in their calamity. In &s;hort, two of
the five went to the bottom, and never &s;aw the
light of God's &s;un, and the other three, with
great difficulty, &s;aved them&s;elves by laying bold
on the rudder of a dung-barge, to which they
were carried by the &s;tream, while Tom, with
great deliberation, &s;wam acro&s;s to the Surry &s;hore.
After this atchievement, he was &s;o much dreaded
by the whole fraternity, that they &s;hivered at the
very mention of his name; and this character,
which &s;ome people would think an advantage to
a man in debt, was the greate&s;t misfortune that
could po&s;&s;ibly happen to him; becau&s;e no trade&s;|man
would give him credit for the lea&s;t trifle, on
the &s;uppo&s;ition, that he could not indemnify him|&s;elf
in the common cour&s;e of law.&endq;</P>
<P>The par&s;on did not approve of Mr. Hacka|tout'$
method of e&s;caping, which he con&s;idered
as a very unchri&s;tian attempt upon the lives of
his fellow-&s;ubjects: &startq;It is enough (&s;aid he) that
we elude the laws of our country, without mu$|thering
the officers of ju&s;tice: for my own part,
I can lay my hand upon my heart, and &s;afely &s;ay,
that I forgive from my &s;oul the fellow by whom
I was made pri&s;oner, although the circum&s;tances
<PB N="170" REF="176">
of his behaviour were treacherous, wicked and
profane. You mu&s;t know, Mr. Pickle, I was
one day called into my chapel, in order to join a
couple in the holy bands of matrimony: and my
affairs being at that time &s;o &s;ituated, as to lay
me under apprehen&s;ions of an arre&s;t, I cautiou&s;ly
&s;urveyed the man through a lettice which was
made for that purpo&s;e, before I would venture
to come within his reach. He was cloathed in
a &s;eaman's jacket and trou&s;&s;ers, and had &s;uch an
air of &s;implicity in his countenance, as dive&s;ted
me of all &s;u&s;picion: I, therefore, without fur|ther
&s;cruple, tru&s;ted my&s;elf in his pre&s;ence, began
to exerci&s;e the duty of my function, and had
actually performed one half of the ceremony,
when the &s;uppo&s;ed woman, pulling out a paper
from her bo&s;om, exclaimed with a ma&s;culine
voice, &startq;Sir, you are my pri&s;oner, I have got a
writ again&s;t you for five hundred pounds.&endq; I
was thunder&s;truck at this declaration, not &s;o
much on account of my own misfortune, which
(thank heaven!) I can bear with patience and
re&s;ignation, as at the impiety of the wretch,
fir&s;tly, in di&s;gui&s;ing &s;uch a worldly aim, under
the cloak of religion; and, &s;econdly, in pro&s;ti|t$ting
the &s;ervice, when there was no occa&s;ion
for &s;o doing, his de&s;ign having previou&s;ly taken
effect. Yet I forgive him, poor &s;oul! becau&s;e
he knew not what he did; and I hope you, Sir
Sipple, will exert the &s;ame chri&s;tian virtue to|wards
the man by whom you was likewi&s;e over|reached.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O! damn the ra&s;cal, (cried the knight)
were I his judge, he &s;hould he condemned to
flames everla&s;ting. A villain! to di&s;grace me
in &s;uch a manner, before almo&s;t all the fa&s;hion|able
<PB N="171" REF="177">
company in town.&endq; Our hero expre&s;&s;ing a
curio&s;ity to know the particulars of this adven|ture,
the knight gratified his de&s;ire, by telling
him, that one evening, while he was engaged in
a partie of cards, at a drum in the hou&s;e of a certain
lady of quality, he was given to under&s;tand by
one of the &s;ervants, that a &s;tranger, very richly
dre&s;&s;ed, was ju&s;t arrived in a chair, preceded by
five footmen with flambeaus, and that he re|fu&s;ed
to come up &s;tairs, until he &s;hould be intro|duced
by Sir Sipple. &startq;Upon this notice (con|tinued
the knight) I judged it was &s;ome of my
quality-friends; and having obtained her lady&s;hip's
permi&s;&s;ion to bring him up, went down to the hall,
and perceived a per&s;on, whom, to the be&s;t of my
recollection, I had never &s;een before. However,
his appearance was &s;o magnificent, that I could
not harbour the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of his true qua|lity;
and &s;eeing me advance, he &s;aluted me with
a very genteel bow, ob&s;erving, that though he
had not the honour of my acquaintance, he
could not di&s;pen&s;e with waiting upon me, even
on that occa&s;ion, in con&s;equence of a letter which
he had received from a particular friend. So &s;ay|ing,
he put a paper into my hand, intimating,
that he had got a writ again&s;t me for ten thou|&s;and
pounds, and that it would be my intere&s;t to
&s;ubmit without re&s;i&s;tance; for he was provided
with a guard of twenty men, who &s;urrounded
the door in different di&s;gui&s;es, determined to &s;e|cure
me again&s;t all oppo&s;ition. Enraged at the
&s;coundrel's fine&s;&s;e, and tru&s;ting to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
of the real footmen a&s;&s;embled in the hall, &startq;So,
you are a ra&s;cally bailiff, (&s;aid I) who have a&s;|&s;umed
the garb of a gentleman, in order to di|&s;turb
her lady&s;hip's company. Take this fel|low,
<PB N="172" REF="178">
my lads, and roll him in the kennel: here
are ten guineas for your trouble.&endq; The&s;e words
were no &s;ooner pronounced, than I was &s;eized,
lifted up, placed in a chair, and carried off in the
twinkling of an eye: not but that the &s;ervants of
the hou&s;e, and &s;ome other footmen, made a mo|tion
towards my re&s;cue, and alarmed all the
company above: but the bailiff affirming with
undaunted effrontery, that I was taken up upon
an affair of &s;tate, and &s;o many people appearing
in his behalf, the counte&s;s would not &s;uffer the
&s;uppo&s;ed me&s;&s;enger to be in&s;ulted; and he carried
me to the county-jail, without further lett or mo|le&s;tation.</P>

<P><HI>THE knight had</HI> &s;carce fini&s;hed this narra|tive,
when our hero was told, that a gen|tleman
in the coffee-room wanted to &s;ee him;
and when he went thither, he found his friend

to the determination of the preceding

he had over-heard on the &s;ubject of his
misfortune: for the manner of the arre&s;t was &s;o
public and extraordinary, that tho&s;e who were
pre&s;ent, immediately propagated it among their
acquaintance; and it was that &s;ame evening di&s;|cour&s;ed
upon at &s;everal tea and card-tables, with
<PB N="173" REF="179">
this variation from the truth, that the debt a|mounted
to twelve thou&s;and, in&s;tead of twelve
hundred pounds: from which circum&s;tance it was
conjectured, that Peregrine was a bite from the
beginning, who had found credit on account of
his effrontery and appearance, and impo&s;ed him|&s;elf
upon the town as a young gentleman of for|tune.
They rejoiced, therefore, at his calamity,
which they con&s;idered as a ju&s;t puni&s;hment for
his fraud and pre&s;umption, and began to review
certain particulars of his conduct, that plainly
demon&s;trated him to be a rank adventurer, long
before he had arrived at this end of his career.</P>
<P>Pickle, who now believed his glory was &s;et
for ever, received this intelligence with that di&s;|$$in
which enables a man to detach him&s;elf ef|fectually
from the world, and, with great tran|quillity,
gave the Mi&s;anthrope an entertaining
$$tail of what he had &s;een and heard &s;ince their
$$&s;t parting. While they amu&s;ed them&s;elves in
this manner over a di&s;h of coffee, they were
$$ined by the par&s;on, who congratulated our hero
upon his bearing mi&s;chance with &s;uch philo&s;ophic
quiet, and began to regale the two friends with
&s;ome curious circum&s;tances relating to the private
$word$ of the &s;everal pri&s;oners, as they happened
to come in.</P>
<P>At length a gentleman entered, at &s;ight of
whom the clergyman ro&s;e up, and &s;aluted him
with a mo&s;t reverential bow, which was gra|$$ou&s;ly
returned by the &s;tranger, who, with a
young man that attended him, retired to the other
end of the room. They were no &s;ooner out of
hearing, than the communicative prie&s;t de&s;ired
his company to take particular notice of this per|&s;on
to whom he had paid his re&s;pects: &startq;That
<PB N="174" REF="180">
man (&s;aid he) is this day one of the mo&s;t flagrant
in&s;tances of neglected virtue which the world
can produce. Over and above a cool, di&s;cerning
head, fraught with uncommon learning and ex|perience,
he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch fortitude and re|&s;olution,
as no difficulties can di&s;courage, and
no danger impair; and &s;o indefatigable is his hu|manity,
that even now, while he is &s;urrounded
with &s;uch embara&s;&s;ments, as would di&s;tract the
brain of any ordinary mortal, he has added con|&s;iderably
to his incumbrances, by taking under
his protection that young gentleman, who, in|duced
by his character, appealed to his benevo|lence
for redre&s;s of the grievances under which
he labours from the villainy of his guardian.&endq;</P>
<P>Peregrine's curio&s;ity being excited by this en|comium,
he a&s;ked the name of this generous pa|tron,
of which when he was informed, &startq;I am
no &s;tranger (&s;aid he) to the fame of that gentle|man,
who has made a con&s;iderable noi&s;e in the
world, on account of that great cau&s;e he under|took
in defence of an unhappy orphan; and &s;ince
he is a per&s;on of &s;uch an amiable di&s;po&s;ition, I
am heartily &s;orry to find that his endeavours have
not met with that &s;ucce&s;sful i&s;&s;ue which their
good fortune in the beginning &s;eemed to pro|mi&s;e.
Indeed, the circum&s;tance of his e&s;pou&s;ing
that cau&s;e was &s;o uncommon and romantic, and
the depravity of the human heart &s;o univer&s;al,
that &s;ome people, unacquainted with his real cha|racter,
imagined his views were altogether &s;elfi&s;h;
and &s;ome were not wanting, who affirmed he
was a mere adventurer. Neverthele&s;s, I mu&s;t
do him the ju&s;tice to own. I have heard &s;ome of
the mo&s;t virulent of tho&s;e who were concerned
<PB N="175" REF="181">
on the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion, bear te&s;timony
in his favour, ob&s;erving, that he was deceived in|to
the expence of the whole, by the plau&s;ible
&s;tory which at fir&s;t engaged his compa&s;&s;ion. Your
de&s;cription of his character confirms me in the
&s;$me opinion; though I am quite ignorant of the
affair, the particulars of which I &s;hould be glad
to learn, as well as a genuine account of his
own life, many circum&s;tances of which are by
his enemies, I believe, egregiou&s;ly mi&s;repre|&s;ented.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Sir,&endq; (an&s;wered the prie&s;t) that is a piece of
&s;atisfaction which I am glad to find my&s;elf ca|pable
of giving you: I have had the plea&s;ure of
being acquainted with Mr. M&mdash;from his
youth, and every thing which I &s;hall relate con|cerning
him, you may depend upon as a fact
which hath fallen under my own cognizance,
or been vouched upon the credit of undoubted
evidence.</P>
<P>Mr. M&mdash;'s father was a mini&s;ter of the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
church of Scotland, de&s;cended from a
very ancient clan, and his mother nearly related
to a noble family in the northern part of that
kingdom. While the &s;on was boarded at a public
&s;chool, where he made good progre&s;s in the
Latin tongue, his father died, and he was left an
orphan to the care of an uncle, who, finding
him determined again&s;t any &s;ervile employment,
kept him at &s;chool, that he might prepare him&s;elf
for the univer&s;ity, with a view of being quali|fied
for his father's profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Here his imagination was &s;o heated by the war|like
atchievements he found recorded in the Latin
authors, &s;uch as Cae&s;ar, Curtius and Buchanan,
<PB N="176" REF="182">
that he was &s;eized with an irre&s;i&s;tible thir&s;t of
military glory, and de&s;ire of trying his fortune
in the army; and his maje&s;ty's troops taking
the field, in con&s;equence of the rebellion which
happened in the year &s;eventeen hundred and
fifteen, this young adventurer, thinking no life
equal to that of a &s;oldier, found means to fur|ni&s;h
him&s;elf with a fufil and bayonet, and
leaving the &s;chool, repaired to the camp near
Stirling, with a view of &s;ignalizing him&s;elf in
the field, though he was at that time but ju&s;t
turned of thirteen. He offered his &s;ervice to &s;e|veral
officers, in hope of being inli&s;ted in their
companies; but they would not receive him, be|cau&s;e
they rightly concluded that he was &s;ome
&s;chool-boy broke loo&s;e, without the knowledge or
con&s;ent of his relations. Notwith&s;tanding this
di&s;couragement, he continued in camp, curiou&s;ly
prying into every part of the &s;ervice; and &s;uch
was the re&s;olution con&s;picuous in him, even at
&s;uch a tender age, that after his &s;mall finances
were exhau&s;ted, he per&s;i&s;ted in his de&s;ign; and,
becau&s;e he would not make his wants known,
actually &s;ub&s;i&s;ted for &s;everal days on hips, haws
and &s;loes, and other &s;pontaneous fruits which
he gathered in the woods and fields. Mean
while, he never failed to be pre&s;ent, when any
regiment, or corps of men, were drawn out to
be exerci&s;ed and reviewed, and accompanied them
in all their evolutions, which he had learned to
great perfection, by ob&s;erving the companies
which were quartered in the place where he was
at &s;chool&punc; This eagerne&s;s and per&s;everance attract|ed
the notice of many officers, who after having
commended his &s;pirit and zeal, pre&s;&s;ed him to re|turn
to his parents, and even threatened to expel
<PB N="177" REF="183">
him from the camp, if he would not comply with
their advice.</P>
<P>The&s;e remon&s;trances having no other effect
than that of warning him to avoid his monitors,
they thought proper to alter their behaviour to|wards
him, took him into their protection, and
even into their me&s;s; and what above all other
marks of favour, plea&s;ed the young &s;oldier mo&s;t,
permitted him to incorporate in the battalion,
$word$ take his turn of duty with the other men. In
$word$ happy &s;ituation he was di&s;covered by a $word$
of his mother, who was a captain in the $word$,
and who u&s;ed all his authority and influence
in per&s;uading M&mdash;to return to &s;chool, but
finding him deaf to his admonitions and threats,
he took him under his own care, and when the
$word$ marched to Dumblane, left him at Stirling,
with expre&s;s injunction to keep him&s;elf within
the walls.</P>
<P>He temporized with his kin&s;man, fearing that
&s;hould he &s;eem refractory, the captain would
have ordered him to be &s;hut up in the ca&s;tle; and
$word$ with the de&s;ire of &s;eeing a battle, no
$word$ &s;aw his relation marched off the ground,
than he mixed in with another regiment, to
which his former patrons belonged, and pro|ceeded
to the field, where he di&s;tingui&s;hed him|&s;elf&punc;
even at that early time of life, by his gal|lantry,
in helping to retrieve a pair of colours be|longing
to M&mdash;n's regiment; &s;o that after the
affair, he was pre&s;ented to the duke of Argyle,
and recommended &s;trongly to brigadier Grant,
who invited him into his regiment, and promi&s;ed
to provide for him with the fir&s;t opportunity:
But that gentleman in a little time lo&s;t his com|mand
upon the duke's di&s;grace, and the regiment
<PB N="178" REF="184">
was ordered for Ireland, being given to colonel
Na&s;&s;au, who&s;e favour, the young volunteer ac|quired
to &s;uch a degree, that he was recommend|ed
to the king for an en&s;igncy, which in all pro|bability
he would have obtained, had not the re|giment
been unluckily reduced.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this reduction, which happen|ed
in the mo&s;t &s;evere &s;ea&s;on of the year, he was
obliged to return to his own country, thro' infi|nite
hard&s;hips, to which he was expo&s;ed from the
narrowne&s;s of his circum&s;tances; and continuing
&s;till enamoured of a military life, he entered into
the regiment of Scotch greys, at that time com|manded
by the late Sir James Campbell, who be|ing
acquainted with his family and character, en|couraged
him with the promi&s;e of &s;peedy prefer|ment.
In this corps he remained three years,
during which, he had no opportunity of &s;eeing
actual &s;ervice, except at the affair of Glen&s;heel;
and this life of in&s;ipid quiet, mu&s;t have hung heavy
upon a youth of M&mdash;'s active di&s;po&s;ition, had
not he found exerci&s;e for the mind, in reading
books of amu&s;ement, hi&s;tory, voyages, and geo|graphy,
together with tho&s;e that treated of the
art of war ancient and modern, for which
he contracted &s;uch $an eager appetite, that he
u&s;ed to &s;pend &s;ixteen hours a day in this em|ployment.
About that time, he became ac|quainted
with a gentleman of learning and ta&s;te,
who ob&s;erving his indefatigable application, and
in&s;atiable thir&s;t after knowledge&punc; took upon
him&s;elf the charge of &s;uperintending his &s;tu|dies;
and by the direction of &s;uch an able guide,
the young &s;oldier converted his attention to a
more &s;olid and profitable cour&s;e of reading&punc; So
inordinate was his de&s;ire of making &s;peedy advan|ces
<PB N="179" REF="185">
in the paths of learning, that within the com|pa&s;s
of three months, he diligently peru&s;ed the
writings of Lock, and Malbranche, and made
him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the fir&s;t fix, and of the ele|venth
and twelfth books of Euclid's elements.
He con&s;idered Puffendorf and Grotius with un|common
care, acquired a tolerable degree of
knowledge in the French language, and his ima|gination
was &s;o captivated with the de&s;ire of
learning, that &s;eeing no pro&s;pect of a war, or
views of being provided for in the &s;ervice, he
quitted the army, and went through a regular
cour&s;e of univer&s;ity education. Having made
&s;uch progre&s;s in his &s;tudies, he re&s;olved to qualify
him&s;elf for the church, and acquired &s;uch a &s;tock
of &s;chool divinity under the in&s;tructions of a learn|ed
profe&s;&s;or at Edinburgh, that he more than
once mounted the ro&s;trum, in the public hall,
and held forth with uncommon applau&s;e: But
being di&s;couraged from a pro&s;ecution of his plan,
by the unrea&s;onable au&s;terity of &s;ome of the
Scotch clergy, by whom, the mo&s;t indifferent
and innocent words and actions, were often
mi&s;con&s;trued into levity and mi&s;conduct; he
re&s;olved to embrace the fir&s;t favourable oppor|tunity
of going abroad, being enflamed with the
de&s;ire of &s;eeing foreign countries, and actually &s;et
out for Holland, where for the &s;pace of two years,
he &s;tudied the Roman law, with the law of na|ture
and nations, under the famous profe&s;&s;ors
Tolieu and Barbyrac.</P>
<P>Having thus fini&s;hed his &s;chool education, he
&s;et out for Paris, with a view to make him&s;elf
perfect in the French language, and learn &s;uch
u&s;eful exerci&s;es, as might be acquired with the
wretched remnant of his &s;lender e&s;tate, which
<PB N="180" REF="186">
was by that time reduced very low. In his
journey through the Netherlands, he went to Na|mure,
and paid his re&s;pects to bi&s;hop Strickland
and general Collier, by whom we was received
with great civility, in con&s;equence of letters of
recommendation, with which he was provided
from the Hague, and the old general a&s;&s;ured him
of his protection and intere&s;t for a pair of colour,
if he was di&s;po&s;ed to enter into the Dutch Service.</P>
<P>Tho' he was by that time, pretty weil cured
of his military Don Quixoti&s;m, he would not to|tally
decline the generous proffer, for which he
thanked him in the mo&s;t grateful terms, telling
the general that he would pay his duty to him on
his return from France, and then, if he could
determine upon returning to the army, &s;hould
think him&s;elf highly honoured in being under his
command.</P>
<P>After a &s;tay of two months in Flanders, he
proceeded to Paris, and far from taking up his
ha$$itation in the &s;uburbs of St. Germ$$, ac|cording
to the cu&s;tom of Engli&s;h travellers, he
hired a private lodging on the other &s;ide of the
river, and a&s;&s;ociated chiefly with French officers,
who (their youthful &s;$llies being over) are allow|ed
to be the polite&s;t gentlemen of that kingdom.
In this &s;cheme he found his account &s;o much,
that he could not but wonder at the folly of his
countrymen, who lo&s;e the main &s;cope of their
going abroad, by &s;pending their time and fortune
idly with one another.</P>
<P>During his re&s;idence in Holland, he had made
him&s;elf acquainted with the be&s;t authors in the
French language, &s;o that he was able to &s;hare in
their conver&s;ation; a circum&s;tance from which he
found great benefit; for, it not only improved
<PB N="181" REF="187">
him in his knowledge of that tongue, but al&s;o
tended to the enlargement of his acquaintance, in
the cour&s;e of which, he contracted intimacies in
&s;ome families of good fa&s;hion, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of
the long robe, which would have enabled him to
pa&s;s his time very agreeably, had he been a little
ea&s;ier in point of fortune: but his finances, not|with&s;tanding
the mo&s;t rigid oeconomy, being, in
a few months, reduced to a very low ebb, the
pro&s;pect of indigence threw a damp upon all his
plea&s;ures, tho' he never &s;uffered him&s;elf to be
thereby, in any degree, di&s;pirited; being in that
re&s;pect, of &s;o happy a di&s;po&s;ition, that con&s;cious
poverty or abundance made very &s;light impre&s;|&s;ions
upon his m$n$.</P>
<P>This con&s;umption of his ca&s;h, however, $word$
him in &s;ome perplexity; and he delibe|rated
with him&s;elf whether he &s;hould return to
general Collier, or repair to London, where he
might po&s;&s;ibly fall into &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s not unbe|coming
a gentleman; tho' he was very much
mortified to find him&s;elf incapable of gratifying
an inor$inate de&s;ire which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him of mak|ing
the grand tour, or at lea&s;t, of vi&s;iting the
&s;outhern parts of France.</P>
<P>While he thus he&s;itated between different &s;ug|ge&s;tion$,
he was one morning, vi&s;ited by a gen|tleman
who had &s;ought and cultivated his friend|&s;hip,
and for whom he had done a good office, in
&s;upporting him with &s;pirit, again&s;t a brutal Ger|man,
with whom he had an affair of honour
$his gentleman came to propo&s;e a party for a
fortnight, to Fontainbleau, where the c$urt then
was: and the prop$&s;al being declined by M&mdash;with
more than u&s;ual &s;tiffne&s;s, his friend was ve|ry
$$gent to know the rea&s;on of his refu&s;al, and
<PB N="182" REF="188">
at length, with &s;ome confu&s;ion, &s;aid, &startq;Perhaps
your finances are low.&endq; M&mdash;replied, that
he had wherewithal to defray the expence of his
journey to London, where he could be furni&s;hed
with a fre&s;h &s;upply; and this an&s;wer was no &s;ooner
made, than the other taking him by the hand,
&startq;My dear friend, (&s;aid he) I am not unacquaint|ed
with your affairs, and would have offered you
my credit long ago, if I had thought it would be
acceptable; even now, I do not pretend to give
you money, but de&s;ire and in&s;i&s;t upon it, that
you will accept of the loan of the&s;e two pieces of
paper, to be repayed when you marry a woman
with a fortune of twenty thou&s;and pounds, or
obtain an employment of a thou&s;and a year.&endq;
So &s;aying he pre&s;ented him with two actions of
above two thou&s;and livres each.</P>
<P>M&mdash;was a&s;toni&s;hed at this unexpected
in&s;tance of genero&s;ity in a &s;tranger, and with
&s;uitable acknowledgment, peremptorily refu&s;ed
to incur &s;uch an obligation; but at length, he
was, by dint of importunity, and warm expo&s;tu|lation
prevailed upon to accept one of the actions,
on condition that the gentleman would take his
note for the &s;um; and this he ab&s;olutely rejected,
until M&mdash;promi&s;ed to draw upon him for
double the value, or more, in ca&s;e he &s;hould at
any time want a further &s;upply. This uncom|mon
act of friend&s;hip and genero&s;ity, M&mdash;af|terwards
had an opportunity to repay ten-fold,
tho' he could not help regretting the occa&s;ion, on
his friend's account. That worthy man having,
by placing too much confidence in a villanous
lawyer, and a chain of other misfortunes, invol|ved
him&s;elf and his amiable lady in a labyrinth
of difficulties, which threatened the total ruin of
<PB N="183" REF="189">
his family; M&mdash;felt the inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;atisfac|tion
of delivering his benefactor from the &s;nare.</P>
<P>Being thus reinforced by the genero&s;ity of his
friend, M&mdash;re&s;olved to execute his former
plan of &s;eeing the &s;outh of France, together with
the &s;eaports of Spain, as far as Cadiz, from
whence he propo&s;ed to take a pa&s;&s;age for London
by &s;ea, and with this view, &s;ent forwards his
trunks by the diligence to Lyons, determined to
ride po&s;t, in order to enjoy a better view of the
country, and for the conveniency of &s;topping at
tho&s;e places where there was any thing remark|able
to be &s;een or enquired into. While he was
employed in taking leave of his Pari&s;ian friends,
who furni&s;hed him with abundant recommenda|tion,
a gentleman of his own country, who &s;poke
little or no French, hearing of his intention, beg|ged
the favour of accompanying him in his expe|dition.</P>
<P>With this new companion, therefore, he &s;et
out for Lyons, where he was perfectly well
received by the intendant and &s;ome of the
be&s;t families of the place, in con&s;equence of
his letters of recommendation; and after a
&s;hort &s;tay in that city, proceeded down the
Rhone, to Avignon, in what is called the <HI>coche
d'eau;</HI> then vi&s;iting the principal towns of
Dauphin&eacute;, Languedoc and Provence, he return|ed
to the delightful city of Mar&s;eilles, where he
and his fellow traveller were &s;o much captivated
by the &s;erenity of the air, the good nature and
ho&s;pitality of the &s;prightly inhabitants, that they
never dreamed of changing their quarters, during
the whole winter, and part of the &s;pring: Here
he acquired the acquaintance of the marquis
<PB N="184" REF="190">
D'Argens, attorney-general in the parliament of
Aix, and of his elde&s;t &s;on, who now makes &s;o
great a figure in the literary world; and when the
affair of father Girard and madamoi&s;elle Cadiere
began to make a noi&s;e, he accompanied the&s;e two
gentlemen to Toulon, where the marquis was
ordered to take precognition of the facts.</P>
<P>On his return to Mar&s;eilles, he found a
certain noble lord of great fortune, under the
direction of a Swi&s;s governor, who had ac|commodated
him with two of his own relations,
of the &s;ame country, by way of companions,
together with five &s;ervants in his train. They
being ab&s;olute &s;trangers in the place, M&mdash;introduced
them to the intendant, and &s;everal
other good families; and had the good fortune to
be &s;o agreeable to his lord&s;hip, that he propo&s;ed,
and even pre&s;&s;ed him to live with him in England,
as a friend and companion; and to take upon him
the &s;uperintendance of his affairs, in which ca&s;e,
he would &s;ettle upon him four hundred a year for
life.</P>
<P>This propo&s;al was too advantageous to be
&s;lighted by a per&s;on of no fortune, or fixed e&s;ta|bli&s;hment;
he, therefore, made no difficulty of
clo&s;ing with it: but as his lord&s;hip's departure
was fixed to a &s;hort day, and he urged him to
accompany him to Paris, and from thence to
England, M&mdash;thought it would be improper
and indecent to interfere with the office of his
governor, who might take umbrage at his favour,
and therefore excu&s;ed him&s;elf from a compliance
with his lord&s;hip's reque&s;t, until his minority
&s;hould be expired, as he was within a few months
of being of age. However, he repeated his im|portunities
&s;o earne&s;tly, and the governor joined
<PB N="185" REF="191">
in the reque&s;t, with &s;uch appearance of cordiality,
that he was prevailed upon to comply with their
joint de&s;ire; and, in a few days, &s;et out with
them for Paris, by the way of Lyons. But be|fore
they had been three days in this city, M&mdash;perceived
a total change in the behaviour of the
Swi&s;s and his two relations, who, in all probabi|lity,
became jealous of his influence with his
lord&s;hip; and he no &s;ooner made this di&s;covery,
than he re&s;olved to withdraw him&s;elf from &s;uch a
di&s;agreeable participation of that young noble|man's
favour. He therefore, in &s;pite of all his
lord&s;hip's intreaties and remon&s;trances, quitted
him for the pre&s;ent; alledging, as a pretext, that
he had a longing de&s;ire to &s;ee Switzerland and
the banks of the Rhine, and promi&s;ing to meet
him again in England.</P>
<P>This his intention being made known to the
governor and his friends, their countenances im|mediately
cleared up, their courte&s;y and com|plai&s;ance
returned, and they even furni&s;hed him
with letters for Geneva, Lau&s;ane, Bern, and
Soleures; in con&s;equence of which, he met with
unu&s;ual civilities at the&s;e places. Having made
this tour with his Scotch friend, (who came up
to him before he left Lyons) and vi&s;ited the mo&s;t
con&s;iderable towns on both fides of the Rhine,
and the courts of the Electors Palatine, Mentz,
and Cologn, he arrived in Holland; and from
thence, thro' the Netherlands, repaired to Lon|don,
where he found my lord ju&s;t returned from
Paris.</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip received him with expre&s;&s;ions of
uncommon joy, would not &s;uffer him to &s;tir from
him for &s;everal days, and introduced him to his
relations.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="192">
M&mdash;accompanied his lord&s;hip from London
to his country-&s;eat, where he was indeed treated
with great friend&s;hip and confidence, and con|&s;ulted
in every thing; but the noble peer never
once made mention of the annuity which he had
promi&s;ed to &s;ettle upon him; nor did M&mdash;re|mind
him of it, becau&s;e he conceived it was his
affair to fulfil his engagements of his own ac|cord.
M&mdash;being tired of the manner of liv|ing
at this place, made an excur&s;ion to Bath,
where he &s;taid about a fortnight, to partake of
the diver&s;ions; and, upon his return, found his
lord&s;hip making di&s;po&s;itions for another journey
to Paris.</P>
<P>Surpri&s;ed at this &s;udden re&s;olution, he endea|voured
to di&s;&s;uade him from it; but his remon|&s;trances
were rendered ineffectual by the in&s;inua|tions
of a foreigner, who had come over with him,
and filled his imagination with extravagant notions
of plea&s;ure, infinitely &s;uperior to any which he
could enjoy while he was in the trammels, and
under the re&s;traints of a governor. He, there|fore,
turned a deaf ear to all M&mdash;'s arguments,
and int$eated him to accompany him in the
journey: but this gentleman, fore&s;eeing that a
young man, like my lord, of &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions,
and ea&s;y to be mi&s;led, would, in all probability,
&s;quander away great &s;ums of money, in a way
that would neither do credit to him&s;elf, or to
tho&s;e who were concerned with him, re&s;i&s;ted all
his &s;olicitations, on pretence of having bu&s;ine&s;s of
con&s;equence at London; and afterwards had rea|&s;on
to be extremely well plea&s;ed with his own
conduct in this particular.</P>
<P>Before he &s;et out on this expedition, M&mdash;, in
ju&s;tice to him&s;elf, reminded him of the propo&s;al
<PB N="187" REF="193">
which he had made to him at Mar&s;eilles, de&s;iring
to know if he had altered his de&s;ign in that par|ticular;
in which ca&s;e, he would turn his thoughts
&s;ome other way; as he would not in the lea&s;t be
thought to intrude or pin him&s;elf upon any man.
My lord prote&s;ted, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn man|ner,
that he &s;till continued in his former re&s;o|lution;
and again be&s;eeching him to bear him
company into France, promi&s;ed that every thing
&s;hould be &s;ettled to his &s;atisfaction, upon their
return to England. M&mdash;, however, &s;till per|&s;i&s;ted
in his refu&s;al, for the abovementioned rea|&s;ons:
and tho' he never heard more of the an|nuity,
he neverthele&s;s continued to &s;erve his lord|&s;hip
with his advice and good offices ever after; par|ticularly
in directing his choice to an alliance with
a lady of eminent virtue, the daughter of a noble
lord, more con&s;picuous for his &s;hining parts than
the &s;plendor of his titles, (a circum&s;tance upon
which he always reflected with particular &s;ati&s;|faction,
as well on account of the extraordinary
merit of the lady, as becau&s;e it ve&s;ted in her
children a con&s;iderable part of that great e&s;tate,
which, of right, belonged to her grandmother)
and afterwards put him in a way to retrieve
his e&s;tate from a heavy load of debt he had con|tracted.
When my lord &s;et out on his Paris ex|pedition,
the money M&mdash;had received from his
generous friend at Paris was almo&s;t reduced to the
la&s;t guinea. He had not yet reaped the lea&s;t
benefit from his engagements with his lord&s;hip;
and di&s;daining to a&s;k for a &s;upply from him, he
knew not how to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, with any degree of
credit, 'till his return.</P>
<P>This uncomfortable pro&s;pect was the more
di&s;agreeable to him, as, at that time of life, he
<PB N="188" REF="194">
was much inclined to appear in the gay world,
had contracted a ta&s;te for plays, opera's, and other
public diver&s;ions, and acquired an acquaintance
with many people of good fa&s;hion, which could
not be maintained without a con&s;iderable expence.
In this emergency, he thought he could not em|ploy
his idle time more profitably than in tran&s;|lating,
from foreign languages, &s;uch books as were
then chiefly in vogue; and upon application to a
friend&punc; who was a man of letters, he was furni&s;hed
with as much bu&s;ine&s;s of that kind as he could po&s;|&s;ibly
manage, and wrote &s;ome pamphlets on the
reigning controver&s;ies of that time, that had the
good fortune to plea&s;e. He was al&s;o concerned
in a monthly journal of literature, and the work
was carried on by the two friends jointly, tho'
M&mdash;did not at all appear in the partner&s;hip.
By the&s;e means he not only &s;pent his mornings
in u&s;eful exerci&s;e, but &s;upplied him&s;elf with mo|ney
for what the French call the <HI>menus plai&s;irs,</HI>
d$ring the whole &s;ummer. He frequented all the
a&s;&s;emblies in and about London, and con&s;iderably
enlarged his acquaintance among the fair &s;ex.</P>
<P>He had, upon his fir&s;t arrival in England, be|c$me
acquainted with a lady at an a&s;&s;embly not
f$r from London; and tho', at that time, he had
n$ t$oughts of extending his views farther th$$
the u&s;ual g$l$antry of the place, he met with &s;uch
$word$ marks of her regard in the &s;equel,
and was &s;o particularly encouraged by the advice
of another lady, with whom he had been intimate
in France, and who was now of their parties, that
he could not help entertaining hopes of making an
impre&s;&s;ion upon the heart of his agreeable partner,
who was a young lady of an ample fortune, and
great expectations. He, therefore, cultivated her
good graces with all the a&s;&s;iduity and addre&s;s of
<PB N="189" REF="195">
which he was ma&s;ter; and &s;ucceeded &s;o well in
his endeavours, that after a due cour&s;e of attend|ance,
and the death of an aunt, by which &s;he
received an acce&s;&s;ion of fortune, to the amount of
three and twenty thou&s;and pounds, he ventured
to declare his pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;he not only heard
him with patience and approbation, but al&s;o re|plied
in terms adequate to his warme&s;t wi&s;h.</P>
<P>Finding him&s;elf &s;o favourably received, he
pre&s;&s;ed her to &s;ecure his happine&s;s by marriage;
but, to this propo&s;al, &s;he objected the recency of
her kin&s;woman's death, which would have ren|dered
&s;uch a &s;tep highly indecent, and the di&s;|plea&s;ure
of her other relations, from whom &s;he
had &s;till greater expectations, and who at that
time importuned her to marry a cou&s;in of her
own, whom &s;he could not like. However, that
M&mdash;might have no cau&s;e to repine at her delay,
&s;he freely entered with him into an intimacy of
corre&s;pondence; during which, nothing could
have added to their mutual felicity, which was
the more poignant and re&s;ined, from the my&s;te|rious
and romantic manner of their enjoying it;
for, tho' he publickly vi&s;ited her as an acquain|tance,
his behaviour, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, was al|ways
&s;o di&s;tant, re&s;pectful, and re&s;erved, that the
re&s;t of the company could not po&s;&s;ibly &s;u&s;pect the
nature of their reciprocal attachment: in con&s;e|quence
of which, they u&s;ed to have private in|terviews,
unknown to every &s;oul upon earth, ex|cept
her maid, who was nece&s;&s;arily intru&s;ted with
the &s;ecret.</P>
<P>In this manner they enjoyed the conver&s;ation of
each other for above twelve months, without the
lea&s;t interruption; and tho' the &s;tability of Mr.
M&mdash;'s fortune intirely depended upon their mar|riage,
<PB N="190" REF="196">
yet as he perceived his mi&s;tre&s;s &s;o aver&s;e to
it, he never urged it with vehemence, nor was at
all anxious on that &s;core; being ea&s;ily induced to
defer a ceremony which, as he then thought,
could in no &s;hape have added to their &s;ati$faction,
tho' he hath &s;ince altered his &s;entiments.</P>
<P>Be that as it will, his indulgent mi&s;tre&s;s, in
order to &s;et his mind at ea&s;e in that particular,
and in full confidence of his honour, in&s;i&s;ted on
his accepting a de$d of gift of her whole fortune,
in con&s;ideration of their intended marriage; and
after &s;ome difficulty, he was prevailed upon to
receive this proof of her e&s;teem, well knowing
that it would &s;till be in his power to return the
obligation. Tho' &s;he often intreated him to take
upon him&s;elf the intire admini&s;tration of her
finances, and upon divers occa&s;ions pre&s;&s;ed him
to accept of large &s;ums, he never once abu&s;ed
her generous di&s;po&s;ition, or &s;olicited her for
money, except for &s;ome humane purpo&s;e, which
&s;he was always more ready to fulfil than he to
propo&s;e.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of this corre&s;pondence, he be|came
acquainted with &s;ome of her female rela|tions;
and, among the re&s;t, with a young lady,
&s;o eminently adorned with all the qualifications of
mind and per&s;on, that, notwith&s;tanding all his
philo&s;ophy and caution, he could not behold and
conver&s;e with her, without being deeply &s;mitten
with her charms. He did all in his power to di&s;|courage
this dangerous inva&s;ion in the beginning,
and to conceal the lea&s;t &s;ymptom of it from her
relation: he &s;ummoned all his reflection to his
aid; and thinking it would be ba&s;e and di&s;hone&s;t
to cheri&s;h any &s;entiment, repugnant to the affec|tion
which he owed to a mi&s;tre&s;s, who had placed
&s;uch unlimited confidence in him, he attempted
<PB N="191" REF="197">
to &s;tifle the infant flame by avoiding the amiable
in&s;pirer of it. But the pa&s;&s;ion had taken too
deep a root in his heart, to be &s;o ea&s;ily extirpated:
his ab&s;ence from the dear object, increa&s;ed the
impatience of his love. The inte&s;tine conflict
between that and gratitude, deprived him of his
re&s;t and appetite. He was, in a &s;hort time,
emaciated by continual watching, anxiety, and
want of nouri&s;hment; and &s;o much altered from
his u&s;ual chearfulne&s;s, that his mi&s;tre&s;s being &s;ur|p$i&s;ed
and alarmed at the change, which, from
the &s;ymptoms, &s;he judged was owing to &s;ome
unea&s;ine&s;s of mind, took all imaginable pains to
di&s;cover the c&agrave;u&s;e.</P>
<P>In all probability, it did not e&s;cape her pene|tration;
for &s;he, more than once, a&s;ked if he was
in love with her cou&s;in; prote&s;ting that, far from
being an ob&s;tacle to his happine&s;s, &s;he would, in
that ca&s;e, be an advocate for his pa&s;&s;ion. How|ever,
this declaration was never made without
manife&s;t &s;igns of anxiety and unea&s;ine&s;s, which
made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon the heart of M&mdash;,
that he re&s;olved to &s;acrifice his happine&s;s, and even
his life, rather than take any &s;tep which might be
con&s;trued into an injury or in&s;ult to a per&s;on who
had treated him with &s;uch genero&s;ity and good|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this re&s;olution, he formed
another which was to go abroad, under pretence
of recovering his health, but in reality, to avoid
the temptation, as well as the &s;u&s;picion of being
incon&s;tant; and in this de&s;ign he was confirmed
by his phy&s;ician, who actually thought him in the
fir&s;t &s;tage of a con&s;umption, and therefore advi&s;|ed
him to repair to the &s;outh of France. He
communicated his de&s;ign, with the doctor's opi|nion,
<PB N="192" REF="198">
to the lady, who agreed to it with much le&s;s
difficulty than he found in conquering his own
reluctance, at parting with the dear object of his
love. The con&s;ent of his generous mi&s;tre&s;s being
obtained, he waited upon her with the in&s;trument
whereby &s;he had made the conveyance of her for|tune
to him; and all his remon&s;trances being in|&s;ufficient
to per&s;uade her to take it back, he can|celled
it in her pre&s;ence, and placed it in that
&s;tate, upon her toilet, while &s;he was dre&s;&s;ing;
whereupon &s;he &s;hed a torrent of tears, &s;aying &s;he
now plainly perceived that he wanted to tear
him&s;elf from her, and that his affections were
&s;ettled upon another. He was &s;en&s;ibly affected
by this proof of her concern; and endeavoured
to calm the perturbation of her mind, by vow|ing
eternal fidelity, and pre&s;&s;ing her to accept of
his hand in due form, before his departure. By
the&s;e means her tran&s;ports were quieted for the
pre&s;ent, and the marriage deferred, for the &s;ame
prudential rea&s;ons which had hitherto prevented
it.</P>
<P>Matters being thus compromi&s;ed, and the day
fixed for his departure, &s;he, together with
her faithful maid, one morning vi&s;ited him
for the fir&s;t time at his own lodgings; and
after breakfa&s;t, de&s;iring to &s;peak with him in pri|vate,
he conducted her into another room, where
a&s;&s;uming an unu&s;ual gravity of a&s;pect, &startq;My dear
M&mdash;(&s;aid &s;he) you are now going to leave
me, and God alone knows if ever we &s;hall meet
again: therefore, if you really love me with that
tenderne&s;s which you profe&s;s, you will accept of
this mark of my friend&s;hip and unalterable affec|tion:
it will at lea&s;t be a provi&s;ion for your jour|$$y;
and if any accident &s;hould befal me, before
I have the happine&s;s of receiving you again into
<PB N="193" REF="199">
my arms, I &s;hall have the &s;atisfaction of knowing
that you are not altogether without re&s;ource.&endq;
So &s;aying, &s;he put an embroidered pocket-book
into his hand. He expre&s;&s;ed the high &s;en&s;e he
had of her genero&s;ity and affection in the mo&s;t
pathetic terms, and begg'd leave to &s;u&s;pend his
acceptance, until he &s;hould know the contents of
her pre&s;ent, which was &s;o extraordinary, that he
ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to receive it: he was, how|ever,
by her repeated intreaties, in a manner
compelled to receive about one half, and &s;he af|terwards
in&s;i&s;ted upon his taking a reinforcement
of a con&s;iderable &s;um for the expence of his
journey.</P>
<P>Having &s;tayed with her ten days beyond the
time he had fixed for his departure, and &s;ettled
the method of their corre&s;pondence, he took his
leave with an heart full of &s;orrow, anxiety and
di&s;traction, produced from the different &s;ugge|&s;tions
of his duty and love. He then &s;et out for
France, and after a &s;hort &s;tay at Paris, proceeded
for Aix in Provence, and from thence to Mar|&s;eilles,
at which two places he continued for
&s;ome months: but nothing he met with being
able to di&s;&s;ipate tho&s;e melancholy ideas which
&s;till preyed upon his imagination, and affected his
&s;pirits, he endeavoured to elude them with a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
of new objects; and with that view, per|&s;uaded
a coun&s;ellor of the parliament of Aix, a
man of great worth, learning and good humour,
to accompany him, in making a tour of tho&s;e parts
of France which he had not yet &s;een. On their
return from this excur&s;ion, they found at Aix an
Italian Abb&eacute;, a per&s;on of character, and great
knowledge of men and books, who having tra|velled
<PB N="194" REF="200">
all over Germany and France, was &s;o far
on his return to his own country.</P>
<P>M&mdash;having, by means of his friend the
coun&s;ellor, contracted an acquaintance with this
gentleman, and being de&s;irous of &s;eeing &s;ome
parts of Italy, particularly the carnival at Venice,
they &s;et out together from Mar&s;eilles, in a tartan,
for Genoa, coa&s;ting it all the way, and lying
on &s;hore every night. Having &s;hewn him what
was mo&s;t remarkable in this city, his friend the
Abb&eacute; was &s;o obliging, as to conduct him thro'
Tu&s;cany, and the mo&s;t remarkable cities in Lom|bardy,
to Venice, where M&mdash;in&s;i&s;ted upon
defraying the expence of the whole tour, in con|&s;ideration
of the Abb&eacute;'s complai&s;ance, which had
been of infinite &s;ervice to him, in the cour&s;e of
this expedition. Having remained five weeks at
Venice, he was preparing to &s;et out for Rome
with &s;ome Engli&s;h gentlemen whom he had met
by accident, when he was all of a &s;udden ob|liged
to change his re&s;olution, by &s;ome di&s;agree|able
letters which he received from London.
He had, from his fir&s;t departure, corre&s;ponded
with his generous, though incon&s;tant mi&s;tre&s;s,
with a religious exactne&s;s and punctuality; nor
was &s;he, for &s;ome time, le&s;s ob&s;ervant of the
agreement they had made. Neverthele&s;s, &s;he,
by degrees, became &s;o negligent and cold in her
expre&s;&s;ion, and &s;o &s;lack in her corre&s;pondence,
that he could not help ob&s;erving and upbraiding
her with &s;uch indifference; and her endeavours
to palliate it were &s;upported by pretexts &s;o frivo|lous,
as to be ea&s;ily &s;een through by a lover of
very little di&s;cernment.</P>
<P>While he tortured him&s;elf with conjectures
about the cau&s;e of this unexpected change, he
<PB N="195" REF="201">
$eceived &s;uch intelligence from England, as,
when joined with what he him&s;elf had perceived,
by her manner of writing, left him little or no
room to doubt of her ficklene&s;s and incon&s;tancy.
Neverthele&s;s, as he knew by experience, that in|formations
of that kind are not to be intirely re|lied
upon, he re&s;olved to be more certainly ap|prized;
and for that end, departed immediately
for London, by the way of Tirol, Bavaria, Al|$ace
and Paris.</P>
<P>On his arrival in England, he learned with in|finite
concern, that his intelligence had not been
at all exaggerated; and his &s;orrow was inexpre&s;|&s;ible,
to find a per&s;on, endowed with &s;o many
other noble and amiable qualities &s;educed into
an indi&s;cretion, that, of nece&s;&s;ity, mu&s;t ruin the
whole plan which had been concerted between
them for their mutual happine&s;s. She made
&s;everal attempts, by letters and interviews, to
palliate her conduct, and &s;often him into a recon|ciliation;
but his honour being concerned, he
remained deaf to all her intreaties and propo&s;als.
Neverthele&s;s, I have often heard him &s;ay, that
he could not help loving her, and revering the
memory of a per&s;on to who&s;e genero&s;ity and
goodne&s;s he owed his fortune, and one who&s;e
foibles were over balanced by a thou&s;and good
qualities. He often in&s;i&s;ted on a re&s;titution; but,
far from complying with that propo&s;al, &s;he hath
afterwards often endeavoured to lay him under
yet greater obligations of the &s;ame kind, and
importuned him, with the warme&s;t &s;olicitations,
to renew their former corre&s;pondence, which he
as often declined.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="202">
M&mdash;took this in&s;tance of the incon&s;tancy
of the &s;ex &s;o much to heart, that he had almo&s;t
re&s;olved, for the future, to keep clear of all en|gagements
for life, and returned to Paris, in or|der
to di&s;&s;ipate his anxiety, where he hired an
apartment in one of the academies in the ex|erci&s;es
whereof he took &s;ingular delight. Dur|ing
his re&s;idence at this place, he had the good
fortune to ingratiate him&s;elf with a great general,
a de&s;cendant of one of the mo&s;t ancient and il|lu&s;trious
families in France; having attracted his
notice by &s;ome remarks he had written on Fo|lard's
Polybius, which were accidentally &s;hewn
to that great man by one of his aids du camp,
who was a particular friend of M&mdash;. The
favour he had thus acquired, was &s;trengthened by
his a&s;&s;iduities and attention. Upon his return to
London, he &s;ent &s;ome of Handel's newe&s;t com|po&s;itions
to the prince, who was particularly fond
of that gentleman's productions; together with
Clark's edition of Cae&s;ar; and in the &s;pring of
the &s;ame year, before the French army took the
field, he was honoured with a mo&s;t obliging let|ter
from the prince, inviting him to come over,
if he wanted to &s;ee the operations of the cam|paign,
and de&s;ring he would give him&s;elf no
trouble about his equipage.</P>
<P>M&mdash;having &s;till &s;ome remains of a military
di&s;po&s;ition, and conceiving this to be a more fa|vourable
opportunity than any he &s;hould ever
meet with again, readily embraced the offer, and
&s;acrificed the &s;oft delights of love, which at that
time he enjoyed without controul, to an eager,
laborious and dangerous curi$&s;ity. In that and
the f$llowing campaign, during which he was
pre&s;ent at the &s;iege of Philip&s;burg, and &s;everal
<PB N="197" REF="203">
other actions, he enlarged his acquaintance among
the French officers, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the graver
&s;ort, who had a ta&s;te for books and literature;
and the friend&s;hip and intere&s;t of tho&s;e gentlemen
were afterwards of &s;ingular &s;ervice to him, tho'
in an affair altogether foreign from their pro|fe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>He had all along made diligent inquiry into the
trade and manufactures of the countries through
which he had occa&s;ion to travel, more particu|larly
tho&s;e of Holland, England and France;
and as he was well acquainted with the revenue
and farms of this la&s;t kingdom, he &s;aw with con|cern
the great di&s;advantages under which our to|bacco-trade
(the mo&s;t con&s;iderable branch of our
commerce with that people) was carried on;
what incon&s;iderable returns were made to the
planters, out of the low price given by the French
company; and how much it was in the power
of that company to reduce it &s;till lower. M&mdash;had
formed a &s;cheme to remedy this evil, &s;o far
as it related to national lo&s;s or gain, by not per|mitting
the duty of one penny in the pound, old
&s;ub&s;idy, to be drawn back, on tobacco re ex|ported.
He demon&s;trated to the mini&s;try of that
time, that &s;o incon&s;iderable a duty could not in
the lea&s;t dimini&s;h the demand from abroad, which
was the only circum&s;tance to be apprehended,
and that the yearly produce of that revenue would
amount to one hundred and twenty thou&s;and
pounds, without one &s;hilling additional expence
to the public: but the mini&s;try having the exci&s;e|&s;cheme
then in contemplation, could think of no
other, till that &s;hould be tried; and that project hav|ing
mi&s;carried, he renewed his application, when
they approved of his &s;cheme in every particular,
<PB N="198" REF="204">
but di&s;covered a &s;urpri&s;ing backwardne&s;s to carry
it into execution.</P>
<P>His expectations in this quarter being di&s;ap|pointed,
he, by the interpo&s;ition of his friends,
pre&s;ented a plan to the French company, in which
he &s;et forth the advantages that would accrue to
them&s;elves, from fixing the price, &s;ecuring that
&s;ort of tobacco which be&s;t &s;uited the ta&s;te of the
public and their manufacture; and finally, pro|po&s;ed
to furni&s;h them with any quantity, at
the price which they paid in the port of Lon|don.</P>
<P>After &s;ome di&s;pute, they agreed to his pro|po&s;al,
and contracted with him for fifteen thou|&s;and
hog&s;heads a year, for which they obliged
them&s;elves to pay ready money, on its arrival in
any one or more convenient ports in the &s;outh or
we&s;tern coa&s;ts of Great Britain, that he &s;hould
plea&s;e to fix upon for that purpo&s;e. M&mdash;no
&s;ooner obtained this contract, than he immedi|ately
&s;et out for America, in order to put it in
execu$ion; and, by way of companion, carried
with him a little French abb&eacute;, a man of humour,
wit and learning, with whom he had been long
acquainted, and for whom he had done many
good offices.</P>
<P>On his arrival in Virginia, which opportunely
happened at a time when all the gentlemen were
a&s;&s;embled in the capital of that province, he pub|li&s;hed
a memorial, repre&s;enting the di&s;advantages
under which their trade was carried on, the true
method of redre&s;&s;ing their own grievances in
that re&s;pect, and propo&s;ing to contract with them
for the yearly quantity of fifteen thou&s;and hog&s;|heads
of &s;uch tobacco as was fit for the French
market, at a price which he demon&s;trated to be
<PB N="199" REF="205">
con&s;iderably greater than that which they had
formerly received.</P>
<P>This remon&s;trance met with all the &s;ucce&s;s
and encouragement he could expect: the prin|cipal
planters &s;eeing their own intere&s;t concern|ed,
readily a&s;&s;ented to the propo&s;al, which, by
their influence, was al&s;o reli&s;hed by the re&s;t;
and the only difficulty that remained, related to
the &s;ecurity for payment of the bills on the ar|rival
of the tobacco in England, and to the time
&s;tipulated for the continuance of the contract.</P>
<P>In order to remove the&s;e objections, Mr. M&mdash;returned
to Europe, and found the French com|pany
of farmers di&s;po&s;ed to agree to every thing
he de&s;ired for facilitating the execution of the
contract, and perfectly well plea&s;ed with the
&s;ample which he had already &s;ent: but his good
friend the abb&eacute;, (whom he had left behind him in
America) by an unparalleled piece of treachery,
found means to overturn the whole project. He
&s;ecretly wrote a memorial to the company, im|porting,
that he found by experience, M&mdash;could
afford to furni&s;h them at a much lower
price than that which they had agreed to give;
and that, by being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the contract
for five years, as was intended according to the
propo&s;al, he would have the company &s;o much in
his power, that they mu&s;t afterwards &s;ubmit to
any price he &s;hould plea&s;e to impo&s;e; and that if
they thought him worthy of &s;uch a tru&s;t, he
would undertake to furni&s;h them at an ea&s;ier rate,
in conjunction with &s;ome of the leading men in
Virginia and Maryland, with whom, he &s;aid, he
had already concerted mea&s;ures for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The company were &s;o much alarmed at the&s;e
in&s;inuations, that they declined complying with
<PB N="200" REF="206">
Mr. M&mdash;'s demands until the abb&eacute;'s return;
and though they afterwards u&s;ed all their endea|vours
to per&s;uade him to be concerned with that
little traitor in his undertaking, (by which he
might &s;till have been a very con&s;iderable gainer)
he re&s;i&s;ted all their &s;olicitations, and plainly told
them in the abb&eacute;'s pre&s;ence, that he would ne|ver
pro&s;titute his own principles &s;o far, as to
enter into engagements of any kind with a per&s;on
of his character, much le&s;s in a &s;cheme that had
a manife&s;t tendency to lower the market-price of
tobacco in England.</P>
<P>Thus ended a project the mo&s;t exten&s;ive, &s;im|ple
and ea&s;y, and (as appeared by the trial made)
the be&s;t calculated to rai&s;e an immen&s;e fortune,
of any that was ever undertaken or planned by a
private per&s;on; a project, in the execution of
which, M&mdash;had the good of the public, and
the glory of putting in a flouri&s;hing condition
that valuable branch of our trade, (which gives
employment to two great provinces, and above
two hundred &s;ail of &s;hips) much more at heart
than his own private intere&s;t. It was rea&s;onable
to expect, that a man, who&s;e debts M&mdash;had
paid more than once, whom he had obliged in
many other re&s;pects, and whom he had carried
with him, at a very con&s;iderable expence, on
this expedition, merely with a view of bettering
his fortune, would have acted with common ho|ne&s;ty,
if not with gratitude: but &s;uch was the
depravity of this little mon&s;ter's heart, that on
his death-bed he left a con&s;iderable fortune to
mere &s;tra$$$$s, with whom he had little or no
connexion, without the lea&s;t thought of refund|ing
the money advanced for him by M&mdash;, in
order to prevent his rotting in jail.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="207">
When M&mdash;had once obtained a command
of money, he, by his knowledge in &s;everal
branches of trade, as well as by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
&s;ome intelligent friends at Paris a$d London,
found means to employ it to very good purpo&s;e;
and had he been a man of that &s;elfi&s;h di&s;po&s;ition,
which too much prevails in the world, he might
have been, at this day, ma&s;ter of a very ample
fortune: but his ear was never deaf to the voice
of di&s;tre&s;s, nor his beneficent heart &s;hut again&s;t
the calamities of his fellow-creatures. He was even
ingenious in contriving the mo&s;t delicate methods
of relieving mode&s;t indigence, and, by his in|du&s;trious
benevolence, often anticipated the re|que&s;ts
of mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>I could relate a number of examples to illu&s;|trate
my a&s;&s;ertions, in &s;ome of which you would
perceive the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted genero&s;ity; but &s;uch
a detail would tre&s;pa&s;s too much upon your time,
and I do not pretend to dwell upon every minute
circum&s;tance of his conduct. Let it &s;uffice to
&s;ay, that, upon the declaration of war with Spain,
he gave up all his commercial &s;chemes, and called
in his money from all quarters, with a view of
&s;itting down, for the re&s;t of his life, contented
with what he had got, and re&s;training his libe|ralities
to what he could &s;pare from his yearly
income. This was a very prudential re&s;olu|tion,
could he have kept it: but, upon the break|ing
out of that war, he could not, without con|cern,
&s;ee many gentlemen of merit, who had
been recommended to him, di&s;appointed of com|mi&s;&s;ions,
meerly for want of money to &s;atisfy
the expectations of the commi&s;&s;ion-brokers of
that time; and therefore launched out con&s;ider|able
&s;ums for them on their bare notes, great
<PB N="202" REF="208">
part whereof was lo&s;t by the death of &s;ome in
the unfortunate expedition to the We&s;t-Indies.</P>
<P>He, at length, after many other actions of the
like nature, from motives of pure humanity,
love of ju&s;tice, and abhorrence of oppre&s;&s;ion,
embarked in a cau&s;e, every way the mo&s;t impor|tant
that ever came under the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the
courts of law in the&s;e kingdoms; whether it be
con&s;idered in relation to the extraordinary nature
of the ca&s;e, or the immen&s;e property of no le&s;s
than fifty thou&s;and pounds a year, and three
peerages, that depended upon it.</P>
<P>In the year 1740, the brave admiral who at
that time commanded his maje&s;ty's fleet in the
We&s;t-Indies, among the other tran&s;actions of his
&s;quadron, tran&s;mitted to the duke of Newca&s;tle,
mentioned a young man, who, tho' in the capa|city
of a common &s;ailor on board one of the &s;hips
under his command, laid claim to the e&s;tate and
titles of the earl of A&mdash;. The&s;e preten&s;ions
were no &s;ooner communicated in the public pa|pers,
than they became the &s;ubject of conver&s;a|tion
in all companies; and the per&s;on whom they
chiefly affected, being alarmed at the appearance
of a competitor, tho' at &s;uch di&s;tance, began to
put him&s;elf in motion, and take all the precau|tions
which he thought nece&s;&s;ary to defeat the
endeavours of the young up&s;tart. Indeed, the
early intelligence he received of Mr. A&mdash;y's
making him&s;elf known in the We&s;t-Indies, fur|ni&s;hed
him with numberle&s;s advantages over that
unhappy young gentleman: for, being in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
of a plentiful fortune, and lord of many
manors in the neighbourhood of the very place
where the claimant was born, he knew all the
witne&s;&s;es who could give the mo&s;t material
<PB N="203" REF="209">
evidence of his legitimacy; and, if his probity
did not re&s;train him, had, by his power and in|fluence,
&s;ufficient opportunity and means of apply|ing
to the pa&s;&s;ions and intere&s;ts of the witne&s;&s;es,
to &s;ilence many, and gain over others to his &s;ide:
while his competitor, by an ab&s;ence of fifteen or
&s;ixteen years from his native country, the want
of education and friends, together with his
pre&s;ent helple&s;s &s;ituation, was rendered ab&s;o|lutely
incapable of taking any &s;tep for his own
advantage. And although his worthy uncle's
con&s;picuous virtue, and religious regard for ju&s;|tice
and truth, might po&s;&s;ibly be an unconquet|able
re&s;traint to his taking any undue advan|tages;
yet the con&s;ciences of that huge army of
emi&s;&s;aries he kept in pay, were not altogether &s;o
very tender and &s;crupulous. This much, how|ever,
may be &s;aid, without derogation from, or
impeachment of the noble earl's nice virtue and
honour, that he took care to compromi&s;e all dif|ferences
with the other branches of the family,
who&s;e intere&s;ts were, in this affair, connected
with his own, by &s;haring the e&s;tate with them, and
al&s;o retained mo&s;t of the eminent council within
the bar of both kingdoms again&s;t this formidable
b$&s;tard, before any &s;uit was in&s;tituted by him.</P>
<P>While he was thus entrenching him&s;elf again&s;t
the attack of a poor forlorn youth, at the di&s;tance
of fifteen hundred leagues, continually expo&s;ed
to the dangers of the &s;ea, the war, and an un|healthy
climate, Mr. M&mdash;, in the common
cour&s;e of conver&s;ation, chanced to a&s;k &s;ome
que&s;tions relating to this romantic pretender, of
$word$ H&mdash;, who was at that time the pre&s;ent
lord A&mdash;y's chief agent. This man, when
p$e&s;&s;ed, could not help owning that the late lord
<PB N="204" REF="210">
A&mdash;m actually left a &s;on, who had been &s;pirited
away into America, &s;oon after his father's death;
but &s;aid he did not know whether this was the
&s;ame per&s;on.</P>
<P>This information could not fail to make an
impre&s;&s;ion on the humanity of Mr. M&mdash;, who,
being acquainted with the genius of the wicked
party who had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of this un|happy
young man's e&s;tate and honours, expre&s;&s;ed
no &s;mall anxiety and apprehen&s;ion le&s;t they &s;hould
take him off by &s;ome means or other; and, even
then, &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to contribute towards the
&s;upport of the friendle&s;s orphan, and to enquire
more circum&s;tantially into the nature of his claim.
In the mean time his occa&s;ions called him to
France; and, during his ab&s;ence, Mr. A&mdash;y
arrived in London, in the month of October
1741.&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>Here the clergyman was interrupted by Pere|g$ine,
who &s;aid there was &s;omething &s;o extra|ordinary,
not to call it improbable, in the ac|count
he had heard of the young gentleman's
being &s;ent into exile, that he would look upon
him&s;elf as infinitely obliged to the doctor, if he
would favour him with a true repre&s;entation of
that tran&s;action, as well as of the manner in
which he arrived and was known at the i&s;land of
Jamaica.</P>
<P>The par&s;on, in compliance with our hero's
reque&s;t, taking up the &s;tory from the beginning,
&startq;Mr. A&mdash;y (&s;aid he) is the &s;on of Arthur late
lord baron of A&mdash;m, by his wife Mary Sh&mdash;d,
natural daughter to John duke of B&mdash;and
N&mdash;by, whom he publickly married on the
21&s;t day of July 1706, contrary to the inclina|tion
of his mother, and all his other relations,
<PB N="205" REF="211">
particularly Arthur late earl of A&mdash;y, who bore
an implacable enmity to the duke her father,
and, for that rea&s;on, did all that lay in his power
to traver&s;e the marriage: but, finding his endea|vours
ineffectual, he was &s;o much offended, that
he would never be perfectly reconciled to lord
A&mdash;m, tho' he was his pre&s;umptive heir. After
their nuptials, they cohabited together in Eng|land
for the &s;pace of two or three years; during
which &s;he mi&s;carried more than once: and he
being a man of levity, and an extravagant di&s;po|&s;ition,
not only &s;quandered away all that he had
received of his wife's fortune, but al&s;o contracted
many con&s;iderable debts, which obliged him to
make a precipitate retreat into Ireland, leaving
his lady behind him in the hou&s;e with his mother
and &s;i&s;ters; who, having al&s;o been aver&s;e to the
match, had always looked upon her with eyes
of di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>It was not likely that harmony &s;hould long
&s;ub&s;i&s;t in this family, e&s;pecially as lady A&mdash;m
was a woman of a lofty &s;pirit, who could not
tamely bear in&s;ults and ill-u&s;age from per&s;ons,
who, &s;he had rea&s;on to believe, were her ene|mies
at heart. Accordingly a mi&s;under&s;tanding
&s;oon happened among them, which was fomented
by the malice of one of her &s;i&s;ters-in-law: divers
&s;candalous reports of her mi&s;conduct, to which the
empty preten&s;ions of a vain, wretched coxcomb
(who was made u&s;e of as an infamous tool for that
purpo&s;e) gave a colourable pretext, were trumped
up, and tran&s;mitted, with many fal&s;e and aggravating
circum&s;tances, to her hu&s;band in Ireland; who,
being a giddy, unthinking man, was &s;o much in|cen&s;ed
at the&s;e in&s;inuations, that, in the fir&s;t
tran&s;ports of his pa&s;&s;ion, he &s;ent to his mother a
<PB N="206" REF="212">
power of attorney, that &s;he might &s;ue for a
divorce in his behalf. A libel was thereupon ex|hibited,
containing many &s;candalous allegations,
void of any real foundation in truth; but being
un&s;upported by any manner of proof, it was at
length di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with co&s;ts, after it had depended
upwards of two years.</P>
<P>Lord A&mdash;m, finding him&s;elf abu&s;ed by the
mi&s;repre&s;entations of his mother and &s;i&s;ter, di&s;|covered
an inclination to be reconciled to his
lady: in con&s;equence of which, &s;he was &s;ent over
to Dublin by her father, to the care of a gentle|man
in that city; in who&s;e hou&s;e &s;he was received
by her hu&s;band, with all the demon&s;trations of
love and e&s;teem. From thence he conducted her
to his lodgings, and then to his country-hou&s;e;
where &s;he had the misfortune to &s;uffer a mi&s;car|riage,
through fear and re&s;entment of my lord's
behaviour, which was often brutal and indecent.
From the country they removed to Dublin, about
the latter end of July, or beginning of Augu&s;t
1714; where they had not long continued, when
her lady&s;hip was known to be again with child.</P>
<P>Lord A&mdash;m and his i&s;&s;ue being next in re|mainder
to the honours and e&s;tate of Arthur earl
of A&mdash;a, was extremely &s;olicitous to have a &s;on;
and, warned by the frequent mi&s;carriages of his
lady, re&s;olved to curb the natural impatience and
ru&s;ticity of his di&s;po&s;ition, that &s;he might not, as
formerly, &s;uffer by his outrageous conduct. He
accordingly cheri&s;hed her with uncommon ten|derne&s;s
and care; and her pregnancy being pretty
far advanced, conducted her to his country-&s;eat,
where &s;he was delivered of Mr. A&mdash;y, about the
latter end of April or beginning of May; for none
of the witne&s;&s;es have been able, at this di&s;tance, with
ab&s;olute certainty, to fix the preci&s;e time of his
<PB N="207" REF="213">
birth, and there was no regi&s;ter kept in the
pari&s;h: and, as an additional misfortune, no gen|tlemen
of fa&s;hion lived in that pari&s;h; nor did
tho&s;e who lived at any con&s;iderable di&s;tance, care
to cultivate an acquaintance with a man of lord
A&mdash;m's &s;trange conduct.</P>
<P>Be that as it will, the occa&s;ion was celebrated
by his lord&s;hip's tenants and dependants upon
the &s;pot, and in the neighbouring town of New
R&mdash;&s;s, by bonfires, illuminations, and other re|joicings;
which have made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion
upon the minds of the people, that, in the place
where they happened, and the contiguous pari&s;hes,
&s;everal hundred people have already declared their
knowledge and remembrance of this event, in
&s;pite of the great power of the claimant's adver|&s;ary
in that quarter, and the great pains and in|direct
methods taken by his numberle&s;s agents
and emi&s;&s;aries, as well as by tho&s;e who are in|tere&s;ted
with him, in the event of the &s;uit, to
corrupt and &s;uppre&s;s the evidence.</P>
<P>Lord A&mdash;m, after the birth of this &s;on,
who was &s;ent to nur&s;e in the neighbourhood,
according to the cu&s;tom of the country, (where
people of the highe&s;t di&s;tinction put their children
out to nur&s;e into farm-hou&s;es and cabbins) lived
in harmony with his lady for the &s;pace of two
years: but having, by his folly and extravagance,
reduced him&s;elf to great difficulties, he demanded
the remainder of her fortune from her father the
duke of B&mdash;, who ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to part
with a &s;hilling, until a proper &s;ettlement &s;hould
be made on his daughter, which by that time he
had put out of his own power to do, by his folly
and extravagance.</P>
<P>As her lady&s;hip, by her endeavours to reform
the oeconomy of her hou&s;e, had incurred the di&s;|plea&s;ure
<PB N="208" REF="214">
of &s;ome idle, profligate fellows, who had
fa&s;tened them&s;elves upon her hu&s;band, and helped
to con&s;ume his &s;ub&s;tance, they &s;eized this oppor|tunity
of the duke's refu&s;al; and, in order to be
revenged upon the innocent lady, per&s;uaded lord
A&mdash;m, that the only means of extracting money
from his grace would be to turn her away, on
pretence of infidelity to his bed, for which, they
hinted, there was but too much foundation. At
their &s;ugge&s;tions, a mo&s;t infamous plan was pro|jected;
in the execution of which, one P&mdash;, a
poor, unbred, &s;imple, country booby, whom they
had decoyed into a &s;nare, lo&s;t one of his ears,
and the injured lady retired that &s;ame day to New
R&mdash;&s;s, where &s;he continued &s;everal years. She
did not, however, leave the hou&s;e, without
&s;truggling hard to carry her child along with her;
but, far from enjoying &s;uch indulgence, &s;trict
orders were given, that the boy &s;hould not, for
the future, be brought within her &s;ight. This
ba&s;e, inhuman treatment, in&s;tead of an&s;wering the
end propo&s;ed, produced &s;uch a contrary effect,
that the duke of B&mdash;, by a codicil to his will,
in which he reflects upon lord A&mdash;m's evil tem|per,
directed his executors to pay to his daughter
an annuity of one hundred pounds, while her lord
and &s;he &s;hould continue to live &s;eparate; and this
allowance cea&s;ed on lord A&mdash;m's death.</P>
<P>While &s;he remained inthis &s;olitary &s;ituation,
the child was univer&s;ally known and received as
the legitimate &s;on and heir of her lord, who&s;e af|fection
for the boy was &s;o con&s;picuous, that in
the mid&s;t of his own nece&s;&s;ities, he never failed
to maintain him in the dre&s;s and equipage of a
young nobleman. In the cour&s;e of his infancy,
his father having often changed his place of re&s;i|dence,
<PB N="209" REF="215">
the child was put under the in&s;truction of
a great many different &s;choolma&s;ters, &s;o that he
was perfectly well known in a great many dif|ferent
parts of the kingdom; and his mother
&s;eized all opportunities (which were but rare, on
account of his father's orders to the contrary) of
&s;eeing, and giving him proofs of her maternal
tenderne&s;s, until &s;he &s;et out for England, after
having been long in a declining &s;tate of health,
by a paralytical di&s;order; upon the con&s;equence
of which, &s;uch dependance was placed by her in|con&s;iderate
hu&s;band, who was by this time re|duced
to extreme poverty, that he actually mar|ried
a woman whom he had long kept as a mi|&s;tre&s;s;
and this creature no &s;ooner under&s;tood
that lady Al&mdash;m was departed from Ireland, than
&s;he openly avowed her marriage, and went about
publickly with lord A&mdash;m, vi&s;iting his ac|quaintances
in character of his wife.</P>
<P>From this aera may be dated the beginning of
Mr. A&mdash;y's misfortunes: this artful woman,
who had formerly treated the child with an ap|pearance
of fondne&s;s, in order to ingratiate her|&s;elf
with the father, now looking upon her&s;elf
as &s;ufficiently e&s;tabli&s;hed in the family, thought
it was high time to alter her behaviour with re|gard
to the unfortunate boy; and accordingly,
for obvious rea&s;ons, employed a thou&s;and arti|fices
to alienate the heart of this weak father
from his unhappy offspring: yet, notwith&s;tand|ing
all her in&s;inuations, nature &s;till maintained her
influence in his heart; and though &s;he often
found means to irritate him by artful and mali|cious
accu&s;ations, his re&s;entment never extended
farther than fatherly correction; and &s;he would
have found it impo&s;&s;ible to accompli&s;h his ruin,
<PB N="210" REF="216">
had not her efforts been reinforced by a new
auxiliary, who was no other than his uncle, the
pre&s;ent u&s;urper of his title and e&s;tate; yet even
this confederacy was over-awed, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure,
by the fear of alarming the unfortunate
mother, till her di&s;temper increa&s;ed to a mo&s;t
deplorable degree of the dead pal&s;y, and the death
of her father had reduced her to a mo&s;t forlorn
and abject &s;tate of di&s;tre&s;s. Then they ventured
upon the execution of their projects; and (though
their aims were widely different) concurred in
their endeavours to remove the haple&s;s boy, as
the common ob&s;tacle to both.</P>
<P>Lord Al&mdash;m, who (as I have already ob|&s;erved)
was a man of weak intellects, and ut|terly
void of any fixed principle of action, being,
by this time, reduced to &s;uch a pitch of mi&s;ery,
that he was often obliged to pawn his wearing-apparel,
in order to p$ocure the common nece&s;|&s;aries
of life; and having no other fund remain|ing,
with which he could relieve his pre&s;ent ne|ce&s;&s;ities,
except his &s;ale of the rever&s;ion of the
A&mdash;a e&s;tate, to which the nonage of his &s;on
was an effectual bar, he was advi&s;ed by his vir|tuous
brother, and the re&s;t of his coun&s;ellors, to
$urmount this difficulty, by &s;ecreting his &s;on, and
&s;preading a report of his death. This hone&s;t
project he the more readily embraced, becau&s;e he
knew that no act of his could fru&s;trate the child's
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Accordingly, the boy was removed
from the &s;chool at which he was then boarded, to
the hou&s;e of one K&mdash;gh, an agent and ac|complice
of the pre&s;ent earl of A&mdash;a, where
he was kept for &s;everal months clo&s;ely confined;
and in the mean time, it was indu&s;triou&s;ly re|ported
that he was dead.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="217">
This previous mea&s;ure being taken, lord A&mdash;m
publi&s;hed adverti&s;ements in the gazettes, offering
rever&s;ions of the A&mdash;a e&s;tate to &s;ale; and
emi&s;&s;aries of various kinds were employed, to in|veigle
&s;uch as were ignorant of the nature of the
&s;ettlement of the&s;e e&s;tates, or &s;trangers to the
affairs of his family. Some people, impo&s;ed up|on
by the report of the child's death, were drawn
in to purcha&s;e, thinking them&s;elves &s;afe in the
concurrence of his lord&s;hip's brother, upon pre|&s;umption
that he was next in remainder to the
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion; others, tempted by the &s;mallne&s;s of
the price, (which rarely exceeded half a year's
purcha&s;e, as appears by many deeds) though they
doubted the truth of the boy's being dead, ran
&s;mall ri&s;ques on the contingency of his dying be|fore
he &s;hould be of age, or in hope of his being
prevailed upon to confirm the grants of his fa|ther;
and many more were treating with him on
the &s;ame notions, when their tran&s;actions were
&s;uddenly interrupted, and the &s;cheme of rai&s;ing
more money, for the pre&s;ent, defeated by the
unexpected appearance of the boy, who being
naturally &s;prightly and impatient of re&s;traint, had
found means to break from his confinement, and
wandered up and down the &s;treets of Dublin,
avoiding his father's hou&s;e, and choo&s;ing to en|counter
all &s;orts of di&s;tre&s;s, rather than &s;ubject
him&s;elf again to the cruelty and malice of the
woman who &s;upplied his mother's place. Thus
deba$red his father's protection, and de&s;titute of
any fixed habitation, he herded with all the loo&s;e,
idle, and di&s;orderly youths in Dublin, &s;kulking
chiefly about the college, &s;everal members and
&s;tudents of which, taking pity on his misfor|tunes,
&s;upplied him at different times with cloaths
<PB N="212" REF="218">
and money. In this un&s;ettled and uncomfortable
way of life did he remain, from the year 1725
to the latter end of November 1727; at which
time his father died &s;o mi&s;erably poor, that he
was actually buried at the public expence.</P>
<P>This unfortunate nobleman was no &s;ooner
dead, than his brother Richard, now earl of
A&mdash;a, taking advantage of the non-age and
helple&s;s &s;ituation of his nephew, &s;eized upon all
the papers of the defunct, and afterwards u&s;urped
the title of lord A&mdash;m, to the &s;urprize of the
&s;ervants, and others who were acquainted with
the affairs of the family. This u&s;urpation, bold
as it was, produced no other effect than that of
his being in&s;ulted by the populace as he went
through the &s;treets, and the refu&s;al of the
king at arms to enrol the certificate of his bro|ther's
having died without i&s;&s;ue. The fir&s;t of
the&s;e inconveniences he bore without any &s;en&s;e of
&s;hame, tho' not without repining, con&s;cious that
it would gradually vani&s;h with the novelty of his
inva&s;ion; and as to the la&s;t, he conquered it by
means well known and obvious.</P>
<P>Nor will it &s;eem &s;trange, that he &s;hould thus
invade the rights of an orphan with impunity, if
people will con&s;ider, that the late lord A&mdash;m
had not only &s;quandered away his fortune, with
the mo&s;t ridiculous extravagance, but al&s;o a&s;&s;o|ciated
him&s;elf with low company; &s;o that he
was little known, and le&s;s regarded, by per&s;ons
of any rank and figure in life; and his child, of
con&s;equence, debarred of the advantages which
might have accrued from valuable connexions.
And tho' it was univer&s;ally known, that lady
A&mdash;m had a &s;on in Ireland, &s;uch was the ob|&s;curity
in which the father had lived, during the
<PB N="213" REF="219">
la&s;t years of his life, that few of the nobility
could be &s;uppo&s;ed to be acquainted with the par|tic$lar
circum&s;tances of a tran&s;action in which
they had no concern, and which had happened at
the di&s;tance of twelve years before the date of this
u&s;urpation. Moreover, as their fir&s;t information
was no other than common fame, the public cla|mour
occa&s;ioned by the &s;eparation, might in&s;pire
&s;uch as were &s;trangers to the family affairs, with
a mi&s;taken notion of the child's having been
born about or after the time of that event. The
$urry and bu&s;tle occa&s;ioned by the arrival of the
lord lieutenant about this period, the reports in|cu&s;triou&s;ly
propagated of the claimant's death,
the ob&s;curity and concealment in which the boy
was obliged to live, in order to elude the wicked
attempts of his uncle, might al&s;o contribute to
his peaceable enjoyment of an empty title: and
la&s;tly, lord chancellor W&mdash;m, who&s;e immediate
province it was to i&s;&s;ue writs for parliament, was
an utter &s;tranger in Ireland, unacquainted with
the de&s;cents of families, and con&s;equently did
not examine farther than the certificate enrolled
in the books of the king at arms. Over and
above the&s;e circum&s;tances, which naturally ac|count
for the &s;ucce&s;s of the impo&s;ture, it may be
ob&s;erved, that the haple&s;s youth had not one re|lation
alive, on the &s;ide of his father, who&s;e in|tere&s;t
it was not to forward or connive at his
de&s;truction; that his grand-father the duke of
B&mdash;was dead; and that his mother was then
in England, in a forlorn, de&s;titute, dying condi|tion,
&s;ecreted from the world, and even from
her own relations, by her woman Mary H&mdash;,
who had a particular intere&s;t to &s;ecrete her, and
altogether dependant upon a mi&s;erable and preca|rious
<PB N="214" REF="220">
allowance from the dutche&s;s of B&mdash;, to
who&s;e caprice &s;he was moreover a mo&s;t wretched
$word$.</P>
<P>N$$with&s;tanding the&s;e concurring circum|&s;tances
in favour of the $word$, he did not think
him&s;elf $word$ while the orphan had any chance
$span$ who would undertake h$s
cau&s;e; and there $span$ a plan for his being
kidnapped, and $word$ to America as a &s;lave. His
$span$ in this humane &s;cheme, was a per&s;on
who carried on the trade of tran&s;p$rting &s;ervants
to our plantations&punc; and was deeply intere&s;ted on
this occa&s;ion, $$ving for a $word$ trifle, purcha&s;ed
of the $span$ A&mdash;m the rever&s;ion of a con|&s;iderable
part of the A&mdash;a e&s;tate; which &s;hame|ful
bargain was confirmed by the brother, but
could never take place, unle&s;s the boy could be
effectually removed.</P>
<P>Every thing being &s;ettled with this auxiliary,
&s;everal ruffians were employed in &s;earch of the
unhappy victim; and the fir&s;t attempt that was
made upon him, in which his uncle per&s;onally
a&s;&s;i&s;ted, happening near one of the great markets
of the city of Dublin, an hone&s;t butcher, with
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his neighbours, re&s;cued him by
force from their cruel hands. This, however,
was but a &s;hort re&s;pite; for (tho', warned by this
adventure, the boy &s;eldom crept out of his lurk|ing
places, without the mo&s;t cautious circum|&s;pection)
he was, in March 1727, di&s;covered by
the diligence of his per&s;ecutors, and forcibly
dragged on board of a &s;hip bound for Newca&s;tle
on Delaware river in America, where he was
&s;old as a &s;lave, and kept to hard labour, much
above his age or &s;trength, for the &s;pace of thir|teen
<PB N="215" REF="221">
years, during which he was transferred from
one per&s;on to another.</P>
<P>While he remained in this &s;ervile &s;ituation, he
often mentioned, to tho&s;e in whom he thought
&s;$ch confidence might be placed, the circum|&s;$$nces
of his birth and title, together with the
manner of his being exiled from his native coun|try;
although, in this particular, he neglected a
caution which he had received in his pa&s;&s;age,
importing, that &s;uch di&s;covery would co&s;t him
his life. Mean while the u&s;urper quietly enjoyed
his right; and to tho&s;e who que&s;tioned him about
his brother's &s;on, con&s;tantly replied, that the
boy had been dead for &s;everal years. And Arthur
earl of A&mdash;a dying in April 1737, he, upon
pretence of being next heir, &s;ucceeded to the
honours and e&s;tate of that nobleman.</P>
<P>The term of the nephew's bondage, which
had been lengthened out beyond the u&s;ual time,
on account of his repeated attempts to e&s;cape,
being expired in the year 1739, he hired him&s;elf
as a common &s;ailor in a trading ve&s;&s;el bound to
Jamaica; and there, being entered on board of
one of his maje&s;ty's &s;hips under the command of
admiral Vernon, openly declared his parentage
and preten&s;ions. This extraordinary claim,
which made a great noi&s;e in the fleet, reaching
the ears of one lieutenant S&mdash;n, nearly related
to the u&s;urper's Iri&s;h wi$e, he believed the young
gentleman to be an impo&s;tor; and thinking it
was incumbent upon him to di&s;cover the cheat,
he went on board of the &s;hip to which the
claimant belonged, and, having heard the account
which he gave of him&s;elf, was, notwith&s;tanding
his prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, convinced of the truth of what
he alledged: and, on his return to his own &s;hip,
<PB N="216" REF="222">
chanced to mention this extraordinary affair upon
the quarter-deck, in the hearing of Mr. B&mdash;n,
one of the mid&s;hipmen, who had formerly been
at &s;chool with Mr. A&mdash;y. This young gentle|man
not only told the lieutenant, that he had
been &s;chool-fellow with lord A&mdash;m's &s;on, but
al&s;o declared that he &s;hould know him again, if
not greatly altered, as he &s;till retained a perfect
idea of his countenance.</P>
<P>Upon this intimation, the lieutenant propo&s;ed
that the experiment &s;hould be tried; and went
with the mid&s;hipman on board the &s;hip that the
claimant was in for that purpo&s;e. After all the &s;ai|lors
had been a&s;&s;embled upon deck, Mr. B&mdash;n, ca&s;t|ing
his eyes around, immediately di&s;tingui&s;hed Mr.
A&mdash;y in the croud, and laying his hand on his
&s;houlder, &startq;This is the man,&endq; &s;aid he; affirm|ing
at the &s;ame time, that, while he continued
at &s;chool with him, the claimant was reputed
and re&s;pected as lord A&mdash;m's &s;on and heir, and
maintained in all re&s;pects &s;uitable to the dignity
of his rank. Nay, he was, in like manner, re|cogn$zed
by &s;everal other per&s;ons in the fleet,
who had known him in his infancy.</P>
<P>The&s;e things being reported to the admiral,
he generou&s;ly ordered him to be &s;upplied with
nece&s;&s;aries, and treated like a gentleman; and,
in his next di&s;patches, tran&s;mitted an account of
the affair to the duke of Newca&s;tle, among the
other tran&s;actions of the fleet.</P>
<P>In September or October 1741, Mr. A&mdash;y
arrived in London; and the fir&s;t per&s;on to whom
he applied for advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, was a man of
the law, nea$ly related to the families of A&mdash;a
and A&mdash;m, and well acquainted with the parti|cular
affairs of each, who, far from treating him
<PB N="217" REF="223">
as a ba&s;tard and impo&s;tor, received him with
civility and &s;eeming kindne&s;s, a&s;ked him to eat,
pre&s;ented him with a piece of money, and, ex|cu&s;ing
him&s;elf from meddling in the affair, ad|vi&s;ed
him to go to Ireland, as the mo&s;t proper
place for commencing a &s;uit for the recovery of
his right.</P>
<P>Before the young gentleman had an oppor|tunity,
or indeed any inclination, to comply with
this advice, he was accidentally met in the &s;treet
by that &s;ame H&mdash;n, who, as I have mentioned,
gave Mr. M&mdash;r the fir&s;t in&s;ight into the affair:
this man immediately knew the claimant, having
been formerly an agent for his father, and after|wards
a creature of his uncle's, with whom he
was, not without rea&s;on, &s;u&s;pected to be con|cerned
in kidnapping and tran&s;porting his nephew.
Be that as it will, his connections with the
u&s;urper were now broke off by a quarrel, in con|&s;equence
of which he had thrown up his agency;
and he invited the haple&s;s &s;tranger to his hou&s;e,
with a view of making all po&s;&s;ible advantage of
&s;uch a gue&s;t.</P>
<P>There he had not long remained, when his
treacherous landlord, tampering with his inexpe|rience,
effected a marriage between him and the
daughter of one of his own friends, who lodged
in his hou&s;e at the &s;$me time: but afterwards,
&s;eeing no per&s;on of con&s;equence willing to e&s;pou&s;$
his cau&s;e, he looked upon him as an incum|brance,
and wanted to rid his hands of him ac|cordingly.
He remembered that Mr. M&mdash;r had
expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with all the humanity of ap|prehen&s;ion,
in favour of the unfortunate young
nobleman, before his arrival in England; and
being well acquainted with the genero&s;ity of his
<PB N="218" REF="224">
di&s;po&s;ition, he no &s;ooner under&s;tood that he was
returned from France, than he waited upon him
with an account of Mr. A&mdash;y's being &s;afely ar|rived.
Mr. M&mdash;r was &s;incerely rejoiced to
find, that a per&s;on who had been &s;o cruelly in|jured,
and undergone &s;o long and continued a &s;cene
of di&s;tre&s;s, was re&s;tored to a country where he
was &s;ure of obtaining ju&s;tice, and where every
good man (as he imagined) would make the cau&s;e
his own: and, being informed that the youth
was in want of nece&s;&s;aries, he gave twenty guineas
to H&mdash;n for his u&s;e, and promi&s;ed to do him all
the &s;ervice in his power; but had no intention to
take upon him&s;elf the whole weight of &s;uch an
important affair, or indeed to appear in the cau&s;e,
until he &s;hould be fully and throughly &s;ati&s;|fied
that the claimant's preten&s;ions were well
founded.</P>
<P>In the mean time, H&mdash;n in&s;inuating that the
young gentleman was not &s;afe in his pre&s;ent
lodging, from the machinations of his enemies,
M&mdash;r accommodated him with an apartment in
his own hou&s;e; where he was at great pains to
remedy the defect in his education, by rendering
him $it to appear as a gentleman in the world:
and having received from him all the intelligence
he could give, r$lating to his own affair, laid the
ca&s;e before council, and di&s;patched a per&s;on to
Ireland, to make further enquiries upon the &s;ame
&s;ubject; who, on his fir&s;t arrival in that king|dom,
found the claimant's birth was as publickly
$word$ as any circum&s;tance of that kind could
po&s;&s;ibly be, at &s;o great a di&s;tance of time.</P>
<P>The u&s;urper and his friends gave all the inter|ruption
in their power to any re&s;earches concern|ing
t$$t affair; and had recour&s;e to every art and
<PB N="219" REF="225">
expedient that could be invented, to prevent its
being brought to a legal di&s;cu&s;&s;ion: privilege,
bills in chancery, orders of court &s;urreptitiou&s;ly
and illegally obtained, and every other invention,
was made u&s;e of to bar and prevent a fair and
hone&s;t trial by a jury. The u&s;urper him&s;elf, and
his agents, at the &s;ame time that they formed
divers con&s;piracies again&s;t his life, in vain endea|voured
to detach Mr. M&mdash;r from the orphan's
cau&s;e by innumerable artifices, in&s;inuati$g, ca|joling,
and mi&s;repre&s;enting with &s;urpri&s;ing dex|terity
and per&s;everance.</P>
<P>His protector, far from being &s;atisfied with their
rea&s;ons, was not only deaf to their remon&s;trances,
but, believing him in danger from their repeated ef|forts,
had him privately conveyed into the coun|try;
where an unhappy accident (which he hath
ever &s;ince &s;incerely regreted) furni&s;hed his adver|&s;ary
a colourable pretext to cut him off in the
beginning of his career.</P>
<P>A man happening to l$&s;e his life, by the acci|dental
di&s;charge of a piece, that chanced to be
in the young gentleman's hands, the account of
$word$ misfortune no &s;ooner reached the ears of his
uncle, than he expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t immoderate
$word$ at having found &s;o good a handle for de&s;troy|i$g
him, under colour of law. He immediately
con&s;titated him&s;elf pro&s;ecutor, &s;et his emi&s;&s;aries
at work to &s;ecure a coroner's inque&s;t &s;uited to his
cruel purpo&s;es; &s;et out for the place in per&s;on,
to take care that the pri&s;oner &s;hould not e&s;cape;
in&s;$lted him in jail, in the mo&s;t inhuman man|ner;
employed a whole army of attornies and
agents, to &s;pirit up and carry on a mo&s;t virulent
pro&s;ecution; practi&s;ed all the unfair methods that
could be invented, in order that the unhappy
<PB N="220" REF="226">
gentleman &s;hould be tran&s;ported to Newgate,
from the healthy pri&s;on to which he was at fir&s;t
committed; endeavoured to inveigle him into
de&s;tructive confe&s;&s;ions; and, not to mention other
more infamous arts employed in the affair of evi|dence,
attempted to &s;urprize him upon his trial,
in the ab&s;ence of his witne&s;&s;es and council, con|trary
to a previous agreement with the pro&s;ecu|tor's
own attorney: nay, he even appeared in
per&s;on upon the bench at the trial, in order to
intimidate the evidence, and brow-beat the un|fortunate
pri&s;oner at the bar, and expended above
a thou&s;and pounds in that pro&s;ecution. In &s;pite
of all his wicked efforts, however, which were
defeated by the &s;pirit and indefatigable indu&s;try
of Mr. M&mdash;r, the young gentleman was ho|nourably
acquitted, to the evident &s;atisfaction of
all the impartial; the misfortune that gave a
handle for that unnatural pro&s;ecution, appearing
to a demon&s;tration to have been a mere ac|cident.</P>
<P>In a few months, his protector, who had now
openly e&s;pou&s;ed his cau&s;e, (taking with him two
gentlemen to witne&s;s his tran&s;actions) conducted
him to his native country, with a view to be
better informed of the &s;trength of his preten&s;ions,
than he could be by the intelligences he had hi|therto
received, or by the claimant's own dark
and almo&s;t obliterated remembrance of the facts
which were e&s;&s;ential to be known. Upon their
arrival in Dublin, application was made to tho&s;e
per&s;ons whom Mr. A&mdash;y had named as his
&s;choolma&s;ters and companions, together with the
&s;ervants and neighbours of his father. The&s;e,
though examined &s;eparately, without having the
lea&s;t previous intimation of what the claimant
<PB N="221" REF="227">
had reported, agreed in their accounts with him,
as well as with one another, and mentioned
many other people as acquainted with the &s;ame
facts to whom Mr. M&mdash;r had recour&s;e, and
&s;till met with the &s;ame unvaried information. By
the&s;e means, he made &s;uch progre&s;s in his in|quiries,
that in le&s;s than two months no fewer
than one hundred per&s;ons, from different quarters
of the kingdom, either per&s;onally, or by letters,
communicated their knowledge of the claimant,
in declarations con&s;onant with one another, as
well as with the accounts he gave of him&s;elf.
Several &s;ervants who had lived with his father,
and been deceived with the &s;tory of his death,
&s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly propagated by his uncle, no &s;ooner
heard of his being in Dublin, than they came
from different parts of the country to &s;ee him;
and though great pains were taken to deceive
them, they, neverthele&s;s, knew him at fir&s;t &s;ight;
&s;ome of them fell upon their knees, to thank
heaven for his pre&s;ervation, embraced his legs,
and &s;hed tears of joy for his return.</P>
<P>Although the conduct of his adver&s;ary, parti|cularly
in the above-mentioned pro&s;ecution, toge|ther
with the evidence that already appeared,
were &s;ufficient to convince all mankind of the
truth of the claimant's preten&s;ions, Mr. M&mdash;r,
in order to be further &s;atisfied, re&s;olved to &s;ee
how he would be received upon the &s;pot where he
was born; ju&s;tly concluding, that if he was really
an impo&s;tor, the ba&s;tard of a kitchen-wench,
produced in a country intirely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by his
enemy and his allies, he mu&s;t be looked upon in
that place with the utmo&s;t dete&s;tation and con|tempt.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="228">
This his intention was no &s;ooner known to the
adver&s;e party, than their agents and friends, from
all quarters, repaired to that place with all po&s;|&s;ible
di&s;patch, and u&s;ed all their influence with
the people, in remon&s;trances, threats, and all
the other arts they could devi&s;e, not only to di&s;|countenance
the claimant upon his arrival, but
even to &s;pirit up a mob to in&s;ult him. Notwith|&s;tanding
the&s;e precautions, and the &s;ervile awe
and &s;ubjection in which tenants are kept by their
landlords in that part of the country, as &s;oon as
it was known that Mr. A&mdash;y approached the
town, the inhabitants crowded out in great mul|titudes
to receive and welcome him, and accom|panied
him into town with acclamations and other
expre&s;&s;ions of joy, in&s;omuch that the agents of
his adver&s;ary dur&s;t not &s;hew their faces. The
&s;overeign of the corporation, who was a parti|cular
creature and favourite of the u&s;urper, and
who&s;e all depended upon the i&s;&s;ue of the cau&s;e,
was &s;o con&s;cious of the &s;tranger's right, and &s;o
much awed by the behaviour of the people, who
knew that con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, that he did not think it
&s;afe, even to pre&s;erve the appearance of neu|trality
upon this occa&s;ion, but actually held the
&s;tirrup while Mr. A&mdash;y di&s;mounted from his
hor&s;e.</P>
<P>This &s;en&s;e of conviction in the people, mani|fe&s;ted
it&s;elf &s;till more powerfully, when he re|turned
to the &s;ame place in the year 1744, about
which time lord A&mdash;a being informed of his
re&s;olution, determined again to be before-hand
with him, and &s;et out in per&s;on with his agents
and friends, &s;ome of whom were detached before
him, to prepare for his reception, and induce the
people to meet him in a body, and accompany
<PB N="223" REF="229">
him to town, with &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions of welcome
as they had before be&s;towed on his nephew: but
in &s;pite of all their art and intere&s;t, he was &s;uf|fered
to pa&s;s through the &s;treet in a mournful &s;i|lence;
and though &s;everal barrels of beer were
produced, to court the favour of the populace,
they had no other effect than that of drawing their
ridicule upon the donor; whereas, when Mr.
A&mdash;y, two days afterwards, appeared, all the
inhabitants, with garlands, &s;treamers, mu&s;ic, and
other en&s;igns of joy, crowded out to meet him,
and u&s;hered him into town with &s;uch demon&s;tra|tions
of plea&s;ure and good-will, that the noble
peer found it convenient to hide him&s;elf from the
re&s;entment of his own tenants, the effects of
which he mu&s;t have &s;everely felt, had not he been
&s;creened by the timely remon&s;trances of Mr.
M&mdash;r, and the other gentlemen who accompa|nied
his competitor.</P>
<P>Nor did his apprehen&s;ion vani&s;h with the tran&s;|actions
of this day; the town was again in uproar
on the Sunday following, when it was known
that Mr. A&mdash;y intended to come thither, from
Du$main, to church: they went out to meet him
as before, and conducted him to the church-door
with acclamations, which terrified his uncle to
&s;$ch a degree, that he &s;ted with precipitation in
a boat, and &s;o$n after inti$ely quitted the place.</P>
<P>It would be almo&s;t an endle&s;s ta&s;k to enumerate
the particular &s;t$ps that were taken by one &s;ide
to pr$m$te, and by the other to delay the trial:
the yo$$g gentleman's adver&s;aries finding that
they $word$ not, by all the &s;ubterfuges and arts
they had $&s;$d, $vade it, repeated attempts were
made to a&s;&s;$&s;&s;inate him and his protector, and
every ob&s;truction thrown in the way of his cau&s;e
<PB N="224" REF="230">
which craft could invent, villany execute, and
undue influence confirm. But all the&s;e difficul|ties
were &s;urmounted by the vigilance, con&s;tancy,
courage and &s;agacity of M&mdash;r; and, at la&s;t,
the affair was brought to a very &s;olemn trial at
bar, which being continued, by &s;everal adjourn|ments,
from the eleventh to the twenty-fifth day
of November, a verdict was found for the
claimant, by a jury of gentlemen, which, in point
of reputation and property, cannot be ea&s;ily pa|ralelled
in the annals of that or any other coun|try;
a jury that could by no means be &s;u&s;pected
of prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in favour of Mr. An&mdash;y, (to
who&s;e per&s;on they were ab&s;olute &s;trangers) e&s;pe|cially
if we con&s;ider that a gentleman in their
neighbourhood, who was nephew to the foreman,
and nearly related to &s;ome of the re&s;t of their
number, forfeited a con&s;iderable e&s;tate by their
deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>This verdict (&s;aid the par&s;on) gave the highe&s;t
&s;atisfaction to all impartial per&s;ons that were with|in
reach of being truly informed of their pro|ceedings,
and of the different genius and conduct
of the parties engaged in the conte&s;t; but more
e&s;pecially to &s;uch as were in court (as I was) at
the trial, and had an opportunity of ob&s;erving
the characters and behaviour of the per&s;ons who
appeared there to give evidence.&mdash;To &s;uch it
was very apparent, that all the witne&s;&s;es produced
there on the part of the uncle, were either his
tenants, dependents, pot-companions, or per&s;ons
&s;ome way or other intere&s;ted in the i&s;&s;ue of the
&s;uit, and remarkable for a low kind of cunning:
that many of them were per&s;ons of profligate
lives, who de&s;erved no credit: that (independent
of the levi$y of their characters) tho&s;e of them
<PB N="225" REF="231">
who went under the denomination of colonels,
(colonel L&mdash;fts alone excepted, who had nothing
to &s;ay, and was only brought there in order to
give credit to that party) made &s;o ridiculous a fi|gure,
and gave &s;o ab&s;urd, contradictory and in|con&s;i&s;tent
an evidence, as no court or jury could
give the lea&s;t degree of credit to.&mdash;On the other
hand, it was ob&s;erved, that the nephew and Mr.
M&mdash;r his chief manager, (being ab&s;olute &s;trangers
in that country, and unacquainted with the cha|racters
of the per&s;ons they had to deal with) were
obliged to lay before the court and jury &s;uch evi|dence
as came to their hand, &s;ome of whom
plainly appeared to have been put upon them by
their adver&s;aries, with a de&s;ign to hurt&mdash;It was
al&s;o manife&s;t, that the witne&s;&s;es produced for Mr.
A&mdash;y were &s;uch as could have no manner of
connexion with him, nor any dep$ndence what|&s;oever
upon him, to influence the$ evidence;
for the far greate&s;t part of them had never &s;een
him from his infancy, till the trial began; and
that many of them (though poor and undignified
with the title of colonels) were people of unble|mi&s;hed
character, of great &s;implicity, and &s;uch as
no man in his &s;en&s;es would pitch upon to &s;upport
a bad cau&s;e.&mdash;It is plain that the jury, (who&s;e
well-known honour, impartiality and penetration
mu&s;t be revered by all who are acquainted with
them) were not under the lea&s;t difficulty about
their verdict; for they were not inclo&s;ed above
half an hour, when they returned with it.&mdash;
The&s;e gentlemen could not help ob&s;erving the
great inequality of the parties engaged, the great
advantages that the uncle had in every other re|&s;pect
(except the truth and ju&s;tice of his ca&s;e)
over the nephew, by means of his va&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions,
<PB N="226" REF="232">
and of his power and influence all round
the place of his birth; nor could the contra&s;t be|tween
the different genius's of the two parties
e&s;cape their ob&s;ervation.&mdash;They could not but
&s;ee and conclude, that a per&s;on who had con|fe&s;&s;edly
tran&s;ported and &s;old his orphan-nephew
into &s;lavery, who, on his return, had carried on
&s;o unwarrantable and cruel a pro&s;ecution to take
away his life, under colour of law, and who had
al&s;o given &s;uch glaring proofs of his &s;kill and dex|terity
in the management of witne&s;&s;es for that
cruel purpo&s;e, was in like manner capable of ex|erting
the &s;ame happy talent on this occa&s;ion,
when his all was at &s;take; more e&s;pecially, as he
had &s;o many others who were equally intere&s;ted
with him&s;elf, and who&s;e abilities, in that re&s;pect,
fell nothing &s;hort of his own, to &s;econd him in
it.&mdash;The gentlemen of the jury had al&s;o a near
view of the $word$ in which the witne&s;&s;es deli|vered
their $word$, and had from thence an
opp$rtunity of ob&s;erving many circum&s;tances and
di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tics of truth and fal&s;hood,
from which a great deal could be gathered, that
could not be adequately conveyed by any printed
account, how exact &s;oever; con&s;equently, they
mu&s;t have been much better judges of the evi|dence
on which they founded their verdict, than
any per&s;on, who had not the &s;ame opportunity,
can po&s;&s;ibly be.</P>
<P>The&s;e, Mr. Pickle, were my reflections on
what I had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve concerning that
famous trial; and on my return to England two
years after, I could not help pitying the &s;elf-&s;uf|ficiency
of &s;ome people, who, at this di&s;tance,
pretended to pa&s;s their judgment on that verdict
with as great po&s;itivene&s;s, as if they had been in
<PB N="227" REF="233">
the &s;ecrets of the cau&s;e, or upon the jury who
tried it; and that from no better authority, than
the declamations of lord An&mdash;a's emi&s;&s;aries,
and &s;ome fal&s;ified printed accounts, artfully cook|ed
up, on purpo&s;e to mi&s;lead and deceive.</P>
<P>But to return from this digre&s;&s;ion, lord A&mdash;a,
the defendant in that cau&s;e, was &s;o con&s;cious of
the &s;trength and merits of his injured nephew's
ca&s;e, and that a verdict would go again&s;t him,
that he ordered a writ of error to be made out
before the trial was ended; and the verdict was
no &s;ooner given, than he immediately lodged it,
though he well knew he had no manner of error
to a&s;&s;ign. This expedient was practi&s;ed merely
for vexation and delay, in order to keep Mr. A&mdash;y
from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;mall e&s;tate he had re|covered
by the verdict; that, his &s;lender funds
being exhau&s;ted, he might be deprived of other
means to pro&s;ecute his right; and, by the mo&s;t
oppre&s;&s;ive contrivances and &s;candalous chicanery,
it has been kept up to this day, without his being
able to a&s;&s;ign the lea&s;t &s;hadow of any error.</P>
<P>Lord A&mdash;a was not the only antagoni&s;t
that Mr. A&mdash;y had to deal with; all the dif|ferent
branches of the A&mdash;a family, who had
been worrying one another at law ever &s;ince the
death of the late earl of A&mdash;a, about the par|tition
of his great e&s;tate, were now firmly united
in an a&s;&s;ociation again&s;t this unfortunate gentle|man;
mutual deeds were executed among them,
by which many great lord&s;hips and e&s;tates were
given up by the uncle to per&s;ons who had no
right to po&s;&s;e&s;s them, in order to engage them to
&s;ide with him again&s;t his nephew, in withholding
the unju&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the remainder.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="234">
The&s;e confederates having held &s;everal con&s;ul|tations
again&s;t their common enemy, and finding
that his cau&s;e gathered daily &s;trength &s;ince the trial,
by the acce&s;&s;ion of many witne&s;&s;es of figure and
reputation, who had not been heard of before;
and that the only chance they had to prevent the
&s;peedy e&s;tabli&s;hment of his right, and their own
de&s;truction, was by &s;tripping Mr. M&mdash;r of the
little money that yet remained, and &s;topping all
further re&s;ources whereby he might be enabled to
proceed; they, therefore, came to a determined
re&s;olution to carry that hopeful &s;cheme into exe|cution;
and, in pur&s;uance thereof, they have le$t
no expedient or &s;tratagem, how extraordinary or
&s;candalous &s;oever, unpracti&s;ed to di&s;tre&s;s Mr.
An&mdash;y and that gentleman. For that end, all
the oppre&s;&s;ive arts and dilatory expen&s;ive con|trivances
that the fertile invention of the lowe&s;t
pettifoggers of the law could po&s;&s;ibly devi&s;e, have
with great dexterity been played off again&s;t them
in fruitle&s;s, quibbling, and malicious &s;uits, intirely
foreign to the merits of the cau&s;e. Not to men|tion
numberle&s;s other acts of oppre&s;&s;ion, the mo&s;t
extraordinary and unprecedented proceedings, by
means whereof this &s;ham writ of error hath been
kept on foot ever &s;ince November 1743, is to
me (&s;aid the doctor) a mo&s;t flagrant in&s;tance,
not only of the prevalency of power and money,
(when employed, as in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, again&s;t an
unfortunate, helple&s;s man, di&s;abled, as he is, of
the means of a&s;certaining his right) but of the
badne&s;s of a cau&s;e, that hath recour&s;e to &s;o many
iniquitous expedients to &s;upport it.</P>
<P>In a word, the whole conduct of lord A&mdash;a
and his party, from the beginning to this time,
hath been &s;uch, as &s;ufficiently manife&s;ts, that it
<PB N="229" REF="235">
could proceed from no other motives than a con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
of Mr. A&mdash;y's right, and of their own
illegal u&s;urpations, and from a terror of tru&s;ting
the merits of their ca&s;e to a fair di&s;cu&s;&s;ion by the
laws of their country: and that the intention and
main drift of all their proceedings plainly tends to
&s;tifle and &s;mother the merits of the ca&s;e from the
knowledge of the world, by oppre&s;&s;ive arts and
and ingenious delays, rather than tru&s;t it to the
candid determination of an hone&s;t jury. What
el&s;e could be the motives of kid-knapping the
claimant, and tran&s;porting him when an infant?
of the various attempts made upon his life &s;ince
his return? of the attempts to dive&s;t him of all
a&s;&s;i&s;tance to a&s;certain his right, by endeavouring
&s;o &s;olicitou&s;ly to prevail on Mr. M&mdash;r to abandon
him in the beginning? of retaining an army of
coun&s;el, before any &s;uit had been commenced?
of the many &s;ini&s;ter attempts to prevent the trial
at bar? of the various arts made u&s;e of to terri|fy
any one from appearing as witne&s;s for the
claimant, and to &s;educe tho&s;e who had appeared?
of the &s;hamele&s;s, unprecedented, low tricks now
practi&s;ed, to keep him out of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that
e&s;tate for which he had obtained the verdict, there|by
to di&s;able him from bringing his cau&s;e to a fur|hearing,
and of the attempts made to buy up
Mr. M&mdash;'s debts, and to &s;pirit up &s;uits
again&s;t him? Is it not obvious from all the&s;e c$$|cum&s;tances,
as well as from the ob&s;truction they
have given to the attorney-general's proceeding to
make a report to his maje&s;ty, on the claimant's pe|tition
to the King for the peerage, which was re|ferred
by his maje&s;ty to that gentleman, &s;o far back
as 1743; that all their efforts are bent to that one
point of &s;tifling, rather than &s;uffering the merits of
<PB N="230" REF="236">
this cau&s;e to come to a fair and candid hearing;
and that the &s;ole con&s;ideration at pre&s;ent between
them and this unfortunate man is not, whether
he is right or wrong, but whether he &s;hall or &s;hall
not find money to bring this cau&s;e to a final de|termination.</P>
<P>Lord A&mdash;a and his confederates not thinking
them&s;elves &s;afe with all the&s;e expedients, while
there was a po&s;&s;ibility of their antagoni&s;t's ob|taining
any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from &s;uch as humanity,
compa&s;&s;ion, genero&s;ity, or a love of ju&s;tice might
induce to lay open their pur&s;es to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance,
in a&s;certaining his right, have, by them&s;elves and
their numerous emi&s;&s;aries, employed all the arts
of calumny, &s;lander and detraction again&s;t him,
by traducing his cau&s;e, vilifying his per&s;on, and
mo&s;t ba&s;ely and cruelly tearing his character to
pieces, by a thou&s;and mi&s;repre&s;entations, pur|po&s;ely
invented and indu&s;triou&s;ly propagated in all
places of re&s;ort, which is a kind of cowardly a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;ination
that there is no guarding again&s;t: yet,
in &s;pite of all the&s;e machinations, and the &s;hameful
indifference of mankind, who &s;tand aloof uncon|cerned,
and &s;ee this unhappy gentleman mo&s;t in|humanly
oppre&s;&s;ed by the weight of lawle&s;s power
and faction, M&mdash;r, far from &s;uffering him&s;elf
to be dejected by the multiplying difficulties that
c$oud upon him, &s;till exerts him&s;elf with amazing
$word$ and a&s;&s;iduity, and will (I doubt not)
bring the affair he began and carried on with &s;o
&s;o much &s;pirit, while his finances la&s;ted, to an
happy conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>It would exc$ed the bounds of my intention,
and perhaps tre&s;pa&s;s too much upon your time,
were I to enumerate the low artifices and &s;hame|ful
quibbles, by which the u&s;urper has found
<PB N="231" REF="237">
means to procra&s;tinate the deci&s;ion of the conte&s;t
between him and his haple&s;s nephew, or to give a
detail of the damage and perplexity which Mr. M&mdash;
has &s;u&s;tained and been involved in, by the trea|chery
and ingratitude of &s;ome who li&s;ted them|&s;elves
under him in the pro&s;ecution of this affair,
and by the villainy of others, who, under various
pretences of material di&s;coveries they had to
make, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> had fa&s;tened them&s;elves upon him,
and continued to do all the mi&s;chief in their
power, until the cloven foot was detected.</P>
<P>One in&s;tance, however, is &s;o flagrantly flagi|tious,
that I cannot re&s;i&s;t the inclination I feel to
relate it, as an example of the mo&s;t infernal per|fidy
that perhaps ever entered the human heart.
I have already mentioned the part which H&mdash;n
acted in the beginning of M&mdash;'s connection with
the unfortunate &s;tranger, and hinted that the
&s;aid H&mdash;n lay under many obligations to that
gentleman, before Mr. A&mdash;y's arrival in England.
He had been chief agent to lord A&mdash;y, and, as
it afterwards appeared, received &s;everal payments
of a &s;ecret pen&s;ion which that lord enjoyed, for
which he either could not, or would not account.
His lord&s;hip, therefore, in order to compel him
to it, took out writs again&s;t him, and his hou&s;e
was continually &s;urrounded with catchpoles for
the &s;pace of two whole years.</P>
<P>Mr. M&mdash;believing, from H&mdash;n's own ac|count
of the matter, that the poor man was
greatly injured, and per&s;ecuted on account of his
attachment to the unhappy young gentleman,
did him all the good offices in his power, and
became &s;ecurity for him on &s;everal occa&s;ions:
nay, &s;uch was his opinion of his integrity, that
after Mr. A&mdash;y was cleared of the pro&s;ecution
<PB N="232" REF="238">
carried on again&s;t him by his uncle, his per&s;on
was tru&s;ted to the care of this hypocrite, who
de&s;ired that the young gentleman might lodge at
his hou&s;e for the convenience of air, M&mdash;'s
own occa&s;ions calling him often into the country.</P>
<P>Having thus, by his con&s;ummate di&s;&s;imulation,
acquired &s;uch a valuable charge, he wrote a let|ter
to one of lord A&mdash;y's attornies, offering to
betray Mr. An&mdash;ey; provided his lord&s;hip would
&s;ettle his account, and give him a di&s;charge for
eight hundred pounds of the pen&s;ion, which he
had received, and not accounted for. Mr. M&mdash;,
informed of this treacherous propo&s;al, imme|diately
removed his lodger from his hou&s;e into
his own, without a&s;&s;igning his rea&s;ons for &s;o
doing, until he was obliged to declare it, in
order to free him&s;elf from the importunities of
H&mdash;n, who earne&s;tly &s;olicited his return. This
mi&s;creant finding him&s;elf detected, and di&s;ap|pointed
in his villainous de&s;ign, was &s;o much en|raged
at his mi&s;carriage, that, forgetting all the
benefits he had received from M&mdash;for a &s;eries of
years, he practi&s;ed all the mi&s;chief that his ma|lice
could contrive again&s;t him; and at length
entered into a confederacy with one G&mdash;tr-y,
and &s;everal other abandoned wretches, who, as
before &s;aid, under various pretences of being able
to make material di&s;coveries, and otherwi&s;e to
&s;erve the cau&s;e, had found means to be employed
in &s;ome extra-bu&s;ine&s;s relating to it, tho' their
real intention was to betray the claimant.</P>
<P>The&s;e confederates, in conjunction with &s;ome
other auxiliaries of infamous character, being in|formed
that Mr. M&mdash;r was on the point of &s;ecuring
a con&s;iderable &s;um, to enable him to pro&s;ecute Mr.
An&mdash;y's right, and to bring it to a happy conclu|&s;ion&punc;
<PB N="233" REF="239">
contrived a deep laid &s;cheme to di&s;appoint
him in it, and at once to ruin the cau&s;e. And
previous mea&s;ures being taken for that wicked
purpo&s;e, they impo&s;ed upon the young gentle|man's
inexperience and credulity, by in&s;inuations
equally fal&s;e, plau&s;ible, and malicious; to which
they at length gained his belief, by the mention
of &s;ome circum&s;tances that gave what they al|leged
an air of probability, and even of truth.
They &s;wore that Mr. M&mdash;had taken out an
action again&s;t him for a very large &s;um of money;
that they had actually &s;een the writ; that the
intention of it was to throw him into pri&s;on for
life, and ruin his cau&s;e, in con&s;equence of an
agreement made by him with lord A&mdash;ey, and
his other enemies, to retrieve the money that
he had laid out in the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>This plau&s;ible tale was enforced with &s;uch an
air of truth, candor, and earne&s;t concern for his
&s;afety, and was &s;trengthened by &s;o many impre|cations,
and corroborating circum&s;tances of their
invention, as would have &s;taggered one of much
greater experience, and knowledge of mankind,
than Mr. A&mdash;ey could be &s;uppo&s;ed at that time.
The notion of perpetual impri&s;onment, and the
certain ruin they made him believe his cau&s;e was
threatened with, worked upon his imagination to
&s;uch a degree, that he &s;uffered him&s;elf to be led
like a lamb to the &s;laughter, by this artful band
of villains; who &s;ecreted him at the lodgings of
one Pr&mdash;nt&mdash;ce, an intimate of G&mdash;y's, for
&s;everal days, under colour of his being hunted
by bailiffs employed by Mr. M&mdash;, where he was
not only obliged by them to change his name,
but even his wife was not &s;uffered to have acce&s;s
to him.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="240">
Their de&s;ign was to have &s;old him, or drawn
him into a ruinous compromi&s;e with his adver&s;a|ries,
for a valuable con&s;ideration to them&s;elves.
But as no ties are binding among &s;uch a knot of
villains, the re&s;t of the con&s;pirators were jockied
by G&mdash;&s;t&mdash;ey; who, in order to monopolize the
advantage to him&s;elf, hurried his prize into the
country, and &s;ecreted him even from his con&s;e|derates,
in a place of concealment one hundred
miles from London, under the &s;ame ridiculous
pretence of M&mdash;'s having taken out a writ
again&s;t him, and of bailiffs being in pur&s;uit of
him every where round London.</P>
<P>He was no &s;ooner there than G&mdash;&s;t&mdash;ey, as a
previous &s;tep to the other villany he intended,
tricked him out of a bond for &s;ix thou&s;and pounds,
under colour of his having a per&s;on ready to ad|vance
the like &s;um upon it, as an immediate fund
for carrying on his cau&s;e; a&s;&s;uring him, at the
&s;ame time, that he had a &s;et of gentlemen ready,
who were willing to advance twenty-five thou|&s;and
pounds more for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, and to
allow him five hundred pounds a year for his
maintenance, 'till his cau&s;e &s;hould be made an
end of, provided that Mr. M&mdash;&s;hould have no
further concern with him or his cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. A&mdash;ey, having by this time received &s;ome
intimations of the deceit that had been put upon
him, made an&s;wer, that he &s;hould look upon
him&s;elf as a very ungrateful mon&s;ter, indeed, if
he de&s;erted a per&s;on who had &s;aved his life, and
&s;o generou&s;ly ventured his own, together with
his fortune, in his cau&s;e, until he &s;hould fir&s;t be
certain of the truth of what was alleged of him,
and ab&s;olutely rejected the propo&s;al. G&mdash;&s;t&mdash;ey,
who had no other view in making it than to
<PB N="235" REF="241">
cover the &s;ecret villany he meditated again&s;t him,
and to facilitate the execution thereof; ea&s;ily re|ceded
from it, when he found Mr. A&mdash;ey &s;o
aver&s;e to it, and undertook neverthele&s;s to rai&s;e
the money; adding, that he might, if he plea&s;ed,
return to Mr. M&mdash;whenever it was &s;ecured.
The whole drift of this pretended undertaking to
rai&s;e the twenty-five thou&s;and pounds, was only
to lay a foundation for a dexterous contrivance
to draw Mr. A&mdash;ey unwarily into the execution
of a deed, relinqui&s;hing all his right and title,
under a notion of its being a deed to &s;ecure the
repayment of that &s;um.</P>
<P>G&mdash;ft&mdash;ey having, as he imagined, &s;o far
paved the way for the execution of &s;uch a deed,
enters into an agreement with an agent, em|ployed
for that purpo&s;e by Mr. A&mdash;ey's adver|&s;aries,
purporting, that in con&s;ideration of the
payment of a bond for &s;ix thou&s;and pounds, which
he, G&mdash;&s;t&mdash;ey, had, as he pretended, laid out in
Mr. A&mdash;ey's cau&s;e, and of an annuity of &s;even
hundred pounds a year, he was to procure for
them from Mr. A&mdash;ey a deed, ready executed,
relinqui&s;hing all right and title to the An&mdash;ey
e&s;tate and honours. Every thing being prepared
for the execution of this infernal &s;cheme, un|known
to Mr. A&mdash;ey, G&mdash;&s;t&mdash;ey then thought
proper to &s;end for him to town from his retire|ment,
in order, as he pretended, to execute a
&s;ecurity for twenty-five thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>This intended victim to that villain's avarice,
no &s;ooner arrived in town, full of hopes of money
to carry on his cau&s;e, and of agreeably &s;urpri&s;ing
his friend and protector Mr. M&mdash;with &s;o &s;ea|&s;onable
and unexpected a reinforcement, than
an unfore&s;een difficulty aro&s;e, concerning the pay|ment
<PB N="236" REF="242">
of G&mdash;&s;t&mdash;ey's &s;ix thou&s;and pound bond&punc;
That money was to have been rai&s;ed out of the
e&s;tate of a lunatic, which could not be done
without the leave of the Court of Chancery, to
whom an account mu&s;t have been given of the
intended application of it. While preparations
were making to rectify this omi&s;&s;ion, G&mdash;&s;t&mdash;ey
immediately carried Mr. A&mdash;ey again into the
country, le&s;t he &s;hould happen to be undeceived
by &s;ome means or other.</P>
<P>In the mean time, this wicked machination
was providentially di&s;covered by Mr. M&mdash;r, be|fore
it could be carried into execution, by means
of the jealou&s;ies that aro&s;e among the con&s;pira|tors
them&s;elves; and was, at the &s;ame time, con|firmed
to him by a per&s;on whom the very agent
for the An&mdash;ey party had entru&s;ted with the
&s;ecret. M&mdash;r no &s;ooner detected it than he com|municated
his di&s;covery to one of Mr. A&mdash;ey's
council, a man of great worth; and immediate|ly
thereupon, took proper mea&s;ures to defeat
it. He then found means to lay open to Mr.
A&mdash;ey him&s;elf, the treacherous &s;cheme that was
laid for his de&s;truction: he was highly &s;en&s;ible of
it; and could never afterwards reflect on the
&s;nare that he had &s;o unwarily been drawn into,
and had &s;o narrowly e&s;caped, without a mixture
of horror, &s;hame, and gratitude to his deliverer.</P>
<P>The con&s;ummate a&s;&s;urance of the mon&s;ters
who were engaged in this plot, after they had
been detected, and upbraided with their treachery,
is &s;carce to be parallelled; for they not only
owned the fact of &s;piriting Mr. A&mdash;ey away, in
the manner abovementioned, but ju&s;tified their
doing it, as tending to his &s;ervice. They al&s;o
maintained, that they had actually &s;ecured the
<PB N="237" REF="243">
twenty-five thou&s;and pounds for him, tho' they
never could name any one per&s;on who was to
have advanced the money. No man was more
active in this &s;cheme than H&mdash;n; nor any man
more &s;olicitous to keep Mr. A&mdash;ey up in the fal&s;e
impre&s;&s;ions he had received, or in projecting me|thods
to ruin his protector, than he.</P>
<P>Among many other expedients for that pur|po&s;e,
a mo&s;t malicious attempt was made to lodge
an information again&s;t him, for trea&s;onable prac|tices,
with the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, notwith&s;tanding
the repeated proofs he had given of his loyalty;
and, as a preparatory &s;tep to this accu&s;ation, a
letter, which this traitor dictated, was copied by
another per&s;on, and actually &s;ent to the earl of
C&mdash;d, importing, that the per&s;on who
copied the letter had an affair of con&s;equence to
communicate to his lord&s;hip&punc; if he would appoint
a time for receiving the information. But that
per&s;on, upon full conviction of the villany of the
&s;cheme, ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to proceed f$rther in
it; &s;o that his malice once more proved abortive:
and before he had time to execute any other con|trivance
of the &s;ame nature, he was impri&s;oned
in this very jail for debt.</P>
<P>Here, finding his creditors inexorable, and
him&s;elf de&s;titute of all other re&s;ource, he made
application to the very man whom he had injured
in &s;uch an outrageous manner, &s;et forth his de|plorable
ca&s;e in the mo&s;t pathetic terms, and in|treated
him, with the mo&s;t abject humility, to
u&s;e his influence in his behalf. The di&s;tre&s;s of
this varlet immediately di&s;armed M&mdash;r of his
re&s;entment, and even excited his compa&s;&s;ion;
and, without &s;ending any an&s;wer to his remon|&s;trances,
he interce$ed for him with his credi|tors:
<PB N="238" REF="244">
and the per&s;on to whom he was chiefly in|debted,
refu&s;ing to relea&s;e him without &s;ecurity,
this unwearied benefactor joined with the pri&s;oner
in a bond for above one hundred and forty pounds,
by which he obtained his relea&s;e.</P>
<P>He was no &s;ooner di&s;charged, however, than
he entered into fre&s;h combinations with G&mdash;y
and others, in order to thwart his deliverer in his
&s;chemes of rai&s;ing money, and otherwi&s;e to di&s;|tre&s;s
and deprive him of liberty; for which pur|po&s;e,
no art or indu&s;try (perjury not excepted)
hath been &s;pared. And, what is &s;till more extra|ordinary,
this per$idious mon&s;ter having found
money to take up the bond, in con&s;equence of
which he regained his freedom, hath procured a
writ again&s;t M&mdash;r, upon that very obligation;
and taken a&s;&s;ignments to &s;ome other debts of that
gentleman, with the &s;ame chri&s;tian intention.
But, hitherto, he hath, by &s;urpri&s;ing &s;agacity
and un&s;haken re&s;olution, baffled all their infernal
contrivances, and retorted &s;ome of their machi|nations
on their own heads: and at this time,
when he is &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome, and repre&s;ented by
others, as under the circum&s;tances of oblivion
and de&s;pondence, he proceeds in his de&s;ign with
the utmo&s;t calmne&s;s and intrepidity, meditating
&s;chemes, and ripening mea&s;ures, that will one
day confound his enemies, and attract the notice
and admiration of mankind.&endq;</P>
<P>Peregrine, having thanked the prie&s;t for his
obliging information, expre&s;&s;ed his &s;urprize at the
&s;candalous inattention of the world to an affair of
&s;uch importance; ob&s;erving, that, by &s;uch inhu|man
neglect, this unfortunate young gentleman,
Mr. A&mdash;ey, was ab&s;olutely deprived of all the
benefit of &s;ociety; the &s;ole end of which is, to
<PB N="239" REF="245">
protect the rights, redre&s;s the grievances, and
promote the happine&s;s of individuals. As for
the character of M&mdash;r, he &s;aid it was &s;o roman|tically
&s;ingular in all its circum&s;tances, that, tho'
other motives were wanting, curio&s;ity alone
would induce him to &s;eek his acquaintance; but
he did not at all wonder at the ungrateful returns
which had been made to his genero&s;ity by H&mdash;n,
and many others, whom he had &s;erved in a man|ner
that few, be&s;ides him&s;elf, would have done;
for he had been long convinced of the truth
conveyed in the&s;e lines of a celebrated Italian
author:</P>
<P>Li beneficii, the per la loro grandezza, non
puonno e&s;&s;er guiderdonati, con la &s;celerata moneta
dell' ingratitudine, &s;ono pagati.</P>
<P>&startq;The &s;tory which you have related of that
young gentleman, (&s;aid he) bears a very &s;trong
re&s;emblance to the fate of a Spani&s;h nobleman,
as it was communicated to me by one of his own
intimate friends at Paris. The counte&s;s d'Al|varez
died immediately after the birth of a &s;on,
and the hu&s;band &s;urviving her but three years,
the child was left &s;ole heir to his honours and
e&s;tate, under the guardian&s;hip of his uncle, who
had a &s;mall fortune and a great many children.
This inhuman relation, coveting the wealth of
his infant ward, formed a de&s;ign again&s;t the life
of the helple&s;s orphan, and tru&s;ted the execution
of it to his valet de chambre, who was tempted
to undertake the murder by the promi&s;e of a con|&s;iderable
reward. He accordingly &s;tabbed the
boy with a knife, in three different places, on
the right &s;ide of his neck: but, as he was not
<PB N="240" REF="246">
u&s;ed to &s;uch barbarous attempts, his hand failed
in the performance; and he was &s;eized with &s;uch
remor&s;e, that, percei$ing the wounds were not
mortal, he carried the haple&s;s victim to the hou&s;e
of a &s;urgeon, by who&s;e care they were healed:
and in the mean time, that he might not forfeit
his recompence, found means to per&s;uade his
employer, that his orders were performed. A
bundle being made up for the purpo&s;e, was pub|lickly
interred as the body of the child, who was
&s;aid to have been &s;uddenly carried off by a con|vul&s;ion;
and the uncle, without oppo&s;ition, &s;uc|ceeded
to his honours and e&s;tate. The boy being
cured of his hurts, was, about the age of &s;ix,
delivered, with a &s;mall &s;um of money, to a mer|chant
ju&s;t embarking for Turkey; who was given
to under&s;tand, that he was the ba&s;tard of a man
of quality; and that, for family rea&s;ons, it was
nece&s;&s;ary to conceal his birth.</P>
<P>While the unfortunate orphan remained in this
deplorable &s;tate of bondage, all the children of
the u&s;urper died one after another; and he him|&s;elf
being taken dangerou&s;ly ill, attributed all his
afflictions to the ju&s;t judgment of God, and com|municated
his anxiety on that &s;ubject to the
valet de chambre, who had been employed in the
murder of his nephew. That dome&s;tic, in order
to quiet his ma&s;ter's con&s;cience, and calm the
perturbation of his &s;pirits, confe&s;&s;ed what he had
done, and gave him hopes of &s;till finding the
boy, by dint of indu&s;try and expence. The un|happy
child being the only hope of the family of
Alvarez, the uncle immediately ordered a minute
inquiry to be &s;et on foot; in con&s;equence of
which he was informed, that the orphan had been
&s;old to a Turk, who had afterwards transferred
<PB N="241" REF="247">
him to an Engli&s;h merchant, by whom he was
conveyed to London.</P>
<P>An expre&s;s was immediately di&s;patched to this
capital, where he under&s;tood that the unhappy
exile had, in con&s;ideration of his faithful &s;er|vices,
been bound apprentice to a French barber-&s;urgeon;
and after he had &s;ufficiently qualified
him&s;elf in that profe&s;&s;ion, been received into the
family of the count de Gallas, at that time the
emperor's emba&s;&s;ador at the court of London.
From the hou&s;e of this nobleman, he was traced
into the &s;ervice of count d'Ober$torf, where he
had married his lady's chamber-maid, and then
$one to &s;ettle as a &s;urgeon in Bohemia.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the&s;e inquiries, &s;everal years
$$$p&s;ed; his uncle, who was very much attached
to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, lived at Barcelona, when
the father of this empre&s;s queen re&s;ided in that
city, and lent him a very con&s;iderable &s;um of
money in the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing emergency of his af|fairs:
and when that prince was on the point of
returning to Germany, the old count finding his
end approaching, &s;ent his father confe&s;&s;or to his
maje&s;ty, with a circum&s;tantial account of the
barbarity he had practi&s;ed again&s;t his nephew,
for which he implored forgivene&s;s, and begg'd he
would give orders, that the orphan, when $ound,
&s;hould inherit the dignities and fortune which he
had unju&s;tly u&s;urped.</P>
<P>His maje&s;ty a&s;&s;ured the old man, that he might
make him&s;elf ea&s;y on that &s;core, and ordered the
confe&s;&s;or to follow him to Vienna, immediately
after the count's death, in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t his en|deavours
in finding out the injured heir. The
prie&s;t did not fail to yield obedience to this com|mand:
<PB N="242" REF="248">
he informed him&s;elf of certain natu|ral
marks on the young count's body, which
were known to the nur&s;e and women who at|tended
him in his infancy; and, with a gen|tleman
whom the emperor ordered to accompany
him, &s;et out for Bohemia, where he &s;oon found
the object of his inquiry, in the capacity of major
domo to a nobleman of that country, he having
quitted his profe&s;&s;ion of &s;urgery for that office.</P>
<P>He was not a little &s;urprized, when he found
him&s;elf circum&s;tantially catechi&s;ed about the par|ticulars
of his life, by per&s;ons commi&s;&s;ioned for
that purpo&s;e by the emperor. He told them,
that he was ab&s;olutely ignorant of his own birth,
though he had been informed, during his re&s;i|dence
in Turkey, that he was the ba&s;tard of a
Spani&s;h grandee, and gave them a minute detail
of the pilgrimage he had undergone. This in|formation
agreeing with the intelligence which
the prie&s;t had already received, and being corro|borated
by the marks upon his body, and the very
&s;cars of the wounds which had been inflicted upon
him in his infancy, the confe&s;&s;or, without fur|ther
he&s;itation, &s;aluted him by the name of count
d'Alvarez, grandee of Spain, and explained the
whole my&s;tery of his fortune.</P>
<P>If he was agreeably amazed at this explana|tion,
the ca&s;e was otherwi&s;e with his wife, who
thought her&s;elf in great danger of being aban|doned
by an hu&s;band of &s;uch high rank; but he
immediately di&s;pelled her apprehen&s;ion, by a&s;|&s;uring
her, that as &s;he had &s;hared in his adver|&s;ity,
&s;he &s;hould al&s;o partake of his good fortune.
He &s;et out immediately for Vienna, to make his
acknowledgements to the emperor, who favoured
<PB N="243" REF="249">
him with a very gracious reception, promi&s;ed to
u&s;e his influence, &s;o that he might enjoy the ho|nours
and e&s;tate of his family; and, in the mean
time, acknowledged him&s;elf his debtor for four
hundred thou&s;and florins, which he had borrowed
from his uncle. He threw him&s;elf at the feet of
his augu&s;t protector, expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t grateful
&s;en&s;e of his goodne&s;s, and begg'd he might be
permitted to &s;ettle in &s;ome of his imperial ma|je&s;ty's
dominions.</P>
<P>This reque&s;t was immediately granted; he was
allowed to purcha&s;e land in any part of the here|ditary
dominions of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, to the
amount of the &s;um I have mentioned; and made
choice of the country of Ratibor in Sile&s;ia, where,
in all probability, he &s;till re&s;ides.&endq;</P>
<P>Peregrine had &s;carce fini&s;hed this narrative,
when he perceived Mr. M&mdash;r &s;lip &s;omething
into the hand of the young man with whom he
had been conver&s;ing at the other end of the room,
and ri&s;e up from the table, in order to take his
leave. He at once under&s;tood the meaning of
this conveyance, and longed for an opportunity
to be acquainted with &s;uch a rare in&s;tance of pri|mitive
benevolence; but the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his
pre&s;ent &s;ituation hindered him from making any
advance, that might be con&s;trued into forward|ne&s;s
or pre&s;umption.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">He is &s;urpri&s;ed with the appearance of Hatchway
and Pipes, who take up their habitation in his
neighbourhood, contrary to his inclination and ex|pre&s;s
de&s;ire.</HEAD>
<P>BEING now regularly initiated in the my&s;|teries
of the Fleet, and reconciled in &s;ome
mea&s;ure to the cu&s;toms of the place, he began
to bear the edge of reflection without wincing;
and thinking it would be highly imprudent in him
to defer, any longer, the purpo&s;es by which only
he could enjoy any ea&s;e and &s;atisfaction in his
confinement, he re&s;olved to re&s;ume his ta&s;k of
tran&s;lating, and every week compo&s;e an occa|&s;ional
paper, by way of revenge upon the mini|&s;ter,
again&s;t whom he had denounced eternal
war. With this view he locked him&s;elf up in
his chamber, and went to work with great eager|ne&s;s
and application; when he was interrupted by
a ticket-porter, who, putting a letter in his hand,
vani&s;hed in a moment, before he had time to
peru&s;e the contents.</P>
<P>Our hero, opening the billet, was not a little
&s;urpri&s;ed to find a bank-note for fifty pounds,
inclo&s;ed in a blank &s;heet of paper; and having
exerci&s;ed his memory and penetration on the &s;ub|ject
of this unexpected windfall, had ju&s;t con|cluded,
that it could come from no other than
the lady who had &s;o kindly vi&s;ited him a few days
before, when his ears were &s;uddenly invaded by
the well-known &s;ound of that whi&s;tle which al|ways
hung about the neck of Pipes, as a memo|rial
of his former occupation; and this tune
<PB N="245" REF="251">
being performed, he heard the noi&s;e of a wooden
leg a&s;cending the &s;tair; upon which he opened
his door, and beheld his friend Hatchway, with
his old &s;hip-mate at his back.</P>
<P>After a cordial &s;hake of the hand, with the
u&s;ual &s;alutation of &startq;What cheer, cou&s;in Pickle?&endq;
hone&s;t Jack &s;eated him&s;elf without ceremony;
and ca&s;ting his eyes around the apartment, &startq;Split
my top&s;tay-&s;ail! (&s;aid he, with an arch &s;neer)
you have got into a &s;nug birth, cou&s;in. Here
you may fit all weathers, without being turned
out to take your watch, and no fear of the &s;hip's
dragging her anchor. You ha'n't much room
to &s;pare, 'tis true: an' I had known as how you
&s;towed &s;o clo&s;e, Tom &s;hould have &s;lung my own
hammock for you, and then you mought have
knocked down this great lubberly hurricane hou&s;e.
But, mayhap, you turn in double, and &s;o you
don't chu&s;e to tru&s;t your&s;elf and your doxy to a
clue and canvas.&endq;</P>
<P>Pickle bore his jokes with great good-humour,
rallied him in his turn about the dairy-maid at
the garri&s;on, enquired about his friends in the
country, a&s;ked if he had been to vi&s;it his niece,
and, finally, expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of knowing the
cau&s;e of his journey to London. The lieutenant
&s;atisfied his curio&s;ity in all the&s;e particulars; and,
in an&s;wer to the la&s;t que&s;tion, ob&s;erved, that
under&s;tanding, from the information of Pipes,
that he was land-locked, he had come from the
country in order to tow him into the $ffing. &startq;I
know not how the wind &s;its (&s;aid he); but if &s;o
be, as three thou&s;and pounds will bring you clear
of the cape, &s;ay the word, and you &s;han't lie
wind-bound another gla&s;s, for want of the
money.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="252">
This was an offer which few people, in our
hero's &s;ituation, would have altogether refu&s;ed;
e&s;pecially as he had all the rea&s;on in the world to
believe, that, far from being a vain, unmeaning
compliment, it was the genuine tribute of friend|&s;hip,
which the lieutenant would have willingly,
ay and with plea&s;ure, paid. Neverthele&s;s, Pere|grine
peremptorily refu&s;ed his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, tho' not
without expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf in terms of acknow|ledgment
&s;uitable to the occa&s;ion; and told him,
it would be time enough to make u&s;e of his gene|ro&s;ity,
when he &s;hould find him&s;elf de&s;titute of
all other re&s;ource. Jack employed all his rheto|rick,
with a view of per&s;uading him to take this
opportunity to procure his own enlargement;
and, finding his arguments ineffectual, in&s;i&s;ted
upon his accepting an immediate &s;upply for his
nece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ions; &s;wearing, with great vehe|mence,
that he would never return to the gari|&s;on,
unle&s;s he would put him upon the footing of
any other tenant, and receive his rent accord|ingly.</P>
<P>Our young gentleman as po&s;itively &s;wore, that
he never would con&s;ider him in that light; re|mon&s;trating,
that he had long ago &s;ettled the
hou&s;e upon him for life, as a pledge of his own
e&s;teem, as well as in conformity with the com|modore's
de&s;ire; and be&s;eeching him to return to
his u&s;ual avocations, prote&s;ted that, if ever his
&s;ituation &s;hould &s;ubject him to the nece&s;&s;ity of
borrowing from his friends, Mr. Hatchway &s;hould
be the fir&s;t man to whom he would apply him&s;elf
for &s;uccour. To convince him that this was not
the ca&s;e at pre&s;ent, he produced the bank-note,
which he had received in the letter, together
with his own ready money; and mentioned &s;ome
<PB N="247" REF="253">
other funds, which he invented <HI>extempore,</HI> in
order to amu&s;e the lieutenant's concern. In the
clo&s;e of this expo&s;tulation, he de&s;ired Pipes to
conduct Mr. Hatchway to the coffee-hou&s;e,
where he might entertain him&s;elf with the news|papers
for half an hour; during which he would
put on his cloaths, and be&s;peak &s;omething for
dinner, that they might enjoy each other's com|pany,
as long as his occa&s;ions would permit him
to &s;tay in that place.</P>
<P>The two &s;ailors were no &s;ooner gone, than he
took up the pen, and wrote the following letter,
in which he inclo&s;ed the bank-note, to his gene|rous
benefactre&s;s:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR humanity is not more ingenious than
my &s;u&s;picion. In vain you attempt to im|po&s;e
upon me by an act of genero&s;ity, which no
per&s;on upon earth, but your lady&s;hip, is capable
of committing. Tho' your name was not &s;ub|&s;cribed
on the paper, your &s;entiments were fully
di&s;played in the contents, which I mu&s;t beg leave
to re&s;tore, with the &s;ame &s;en&s;e of gratitude, and
for the &s;ame rea&s;ons I expre&s;&s;ed, when la&s;t I had
the honour to conver&s;e with you upon this &s;ub|ject.
Tho' I am deprived of my liberty, by the
villainy and ingratitude of mankind, I am not
yet de&s;titute of the other conveniencies of life;
and, therefore, beg to be excu&s;ed from incurring
an unnece&s;&s;ary addition to that load of obligation
you have already laid upon,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE>
Your lady&s;hip's mo&s;t devoted,
Humble &s;ervant,
<SIGNED>Peregrine Pickle.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="248" REF="254">
Having dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, and repaired to the
place of appointment, he di&s;patched this epi&s;tle
by the hands of Pipes, who was ordered to leave
it at her lady&s;hip's hou&s;e, without &s;taying for an
an&s;wer; and in the mean time gave directions
for dinner, which he and his friend Hatchway
ate very chearfully in his own apartment, after
he had entertained him with a &s;ight of all the
curio&s;ities in the place. During their repa&s;t,
Jack repeated his kind offers to our adventurer,
who declined them with his former ob&s;tinacy,
and begged he might be no more importuned on
that &s;ubject: but, if he in&s;i&s;ted upon giving &s;ome
fre&s;h proofs of his friend&s;hip, he might have an
opportunity of exhibiting it in taking Pipes un|der
his care and protection; for nothing affected
him &s;o much as his inability to provide for &s;uch
a faithful adherent.</P>
<P>The lieutenant de&s;ired he would give him&s;elf
no trouble upon that &s;core; he being, of his own
accord, perfectly well di&s;po&s;ed to befriend his
old &s;hip-mate, who &s;hould never want, while he
had a &s;hilling to &s;pare. But he began to drop
&s;ome hints of an intention to fix his quarters in
the Fleet, ob&s;erving, that the air &s;eemed to be
very good in that place, and that he was tired of
living in the country. What he &s;aid did not
amount to a plain declaration, and therefore Pe|regrine
did not an&s;wer it as &s;uch, tho' he per|ceived
his drift; and took an opportunity of de|&s;cribing
the inconveniences of the place, in &s;uch
a manner, as he hoped would deter him from
putting &s;uch an extravagant plan in execution.</P>
<P>This expedient, however, far from an&s;wering
the end propo&s;ed, had a quite contrary effect,
and furni&s;hed Hatchway with an argument again&s;t
<PB N="249" REF="255">
his own unwillingne&s;s to quit &s;uch a di&s;agreeable
place. And, in all probability, Jack would have
been more explicit, with regard to the &s;cheme he
had propo&s;ed, if the conver&s;ation had not been
interrupted by the arrival of Cadwallader, who
never failed in the performance of his diurnal
vi&s;it. Hatchway, conjecturing that this &s;tranger
might have &s;ome private bu&s;ine&s;s with his friend,
quitted the apartment, on pretence of taking a
turn: and meeting Pipes at the door, de&s;ired his
company to the Bear, by which name the open
&s;pace is di&s;tingui&s;hed; where, during a cour&s;e of
perambulation, the&s;e two companions held a
council upon Pickle: in con&s;equence of which it
was determined, &s;ince he ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ted to
refu&s;e their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, that they &s;hould take lodg|ings
in his neighbourhood, with a view of being
at hand to mini&s;ter unto his occa&s;ions, in &s;pite of
his fal&s;e delicacy, according to the emergency of
his affairs.</P>
<P>This re&s;olution being taken, they con&s;ulted the
bar-keeper of the coffee-hou&s;e about lodging,
and &s;he directed them to the warden; to whom
the lieutenant, in his great wi&s;dom, repre&s;ented
him&s;elf as a kin&s;man to Peregrine, who, rather
than leave that young gentleman by him&s;elf to
the unavoidable di&s;comforts of a pri&s;on, was in|clined
to keep him company, 'till &s;uch time as
his affairs could be put in order. This mea&s;ure
he the more anxiou&s;ly de&s;ired to take, becau&s;e
the pri&s;oner was &s;ometimes &s;ubject to a di&s;ordered
imagination, upon which occa&s;ion he &s;tood in
need of extraordinary attendance; and therefore
he (the lieutenant) intreated the warden to ac|commodate
him with a lodging for him&s;elf and
his &s;ervant, for which he was ready to make any
<PB N="250" REF="256">
rea&s;onable acknowledgment. The warden, who
was a &s;en&s;ible and humane man, could not help
applauding his re&s;olution; and &s;everal rooms
being at that time unoccupied, he put him im|mediately
in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a couple, which were
forthwith prepared for his reception.</P>
<P>This affair being &s;ettled to his &s;atisfaction, he
di&s;patched Pipes for his portmanteau; and re|turning
to the coffee-hou&s;e, &s;ound Peregrine,
with whom he &s;pent the remaining part of the
evening. Our hero, taking it for granted that
he propo&s;ed to &s;et out for the gari&s;on next day,
wrote a memorandum of &s;ome books which he
had left in that habitation, and which he now
de&s;ired Jack to &s;end up to town by the waggon,
directed for Mr. Crabtree; and cautioned him
again&s;t giving the lea&s;t hint of his misfortune in
the neighbourhood, that it might remain, as long
as po&s;&s;ible, concealed from the knowledge of his
&s;i&s;ter, (who, he knew, would afflict her&s;elf im|moderately
at the news) nor reach the ears of
the re&s;t of his family, who would exult and
triumph over his di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Hatchway li&s;tened to his injunctions with great
attention, and promi&s;ed to demean him&s;elf ac|cordingly:
then the di&s;cour&s;e &s;hifted to an agree|able
recapitulation of the merry &s;cenes they had
formerly acted together; and the evening being
pretty far advanced, Peregrine, with &s;eeming re|luctance,
told him that the gates of the Fleet
would in a few minutes be &s;hut for the night,
and that there was an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity for his
withdrawing to his lodging. Jack replied, that
he could not think of parting with him &s;o &s;oon,
after &s;uch a long &s;eparation; and that he was de|termined
to &s;tay with him an hour or two longer,
<PB N="251" REF="257">
if he &s;hould be obliged to take up his lodging in
the &s;treets. Pickle, rather than di&s;oblige his
gue&s;t, indulged him in his de&s;ire, and re&s;olved to
give him a &s;hare of his own bed. A pair of
chickens and '&s;paragus were be&s;poken for &s;upper,
at which Pipes attended with an air of internal
&s;atisfaction; and the bottle was bandied about in
a jovial manner 'till midnight, when the lieu|tenant
ro&s;e up to take his leave, ob&s;erving, that
being fatigued with riding, he was inclined to
turn-in. Pipes, upon this intimation, produced
a lanthorn ready lighted; and Jack, &s;haking his
entertainer by the hand, wi&s;hed him good-night,
and promi&s;ed to vi&s;it him again betimes in the
morning.</P>
<P>Peregrine, imagining that this behaviour pro|ceeded
from the wine, which he had plentifully
drank, told him, that if he was di&s;po&s;ed to &s;leep,
his bed was ready prepared in the room, and or|dered
his attendant to undre&s;s his ma&s;ter; upon
which Mr. Hatchway gave him to under&s;tand,
that he had no occa&s;ion to incommode his friend,
having already provided a lodging for him&s;elf:
and the young gentleman demanding an explana|tion,
he frankly owned what he had done, &s;ay|ing,
&startq;You gave me &s;uch a di&s;mal account of
the place, that I could not think of leaving you
in it without company.&endq; Our young gentle|man,
who was naturally impatient of benefits,
and fore&s;aw that this uncommon in&s;tance of
Hatchway's friend&s;hip would encroach upon the
plan which he had formed for his own &s;ub&s;i&s;tence,
by engro&s;&s;ing his time and attention, &s;o as that
he &s;hould not be able to pro&s;ecute his labours;
clo&s;eted the lieutenant next day, and demon|&s;trated
to him the folly and ill con&s;equences of
<PB N="252" REF="258">
the &s;tep he had taken. He ob&s;erved, that the
world in general would look upon it as the effect
of mere madne&s;s; and, if his relations were &s;o
di&s;po&s;ed, they might make it the foundation of a
&s;tatute of lunacy again&s;t him; that his ab&s;ence
from the gari&s;on mu&s;t be a very great detriment
to his private affairs; and, la&s;tly, that his pre&s;ence
in the Fleet would be a very great hindrance to
Pickle him&s;elf, who&s;e hope of regaining his li|berty
altogether depended upon his being de|tached
from all company and interruption.</P>
<P>To the&s;e remon&s;trances Jack replied, that, as
to the opinion of the world, it was no more to
him than a rotten net-line; and if his relations
had a mind to have his upper works condemned,
he did not doubt but he &s;hould be able to &s;tand
the &s;urvey, without being declared unfit for &s;er|vice;
that he had no affairs at the gari&s;on, but
&s;uch as would keep cold; and with regard to
Pickle's being interrupted by his pre&s;ence, he gave
him his word, that he would never come along|&s;ide
of him, except when he &s;hould give him the
&s;ignal for holding di&s;cour&s;e. In conclu&s;ion, he
&s;ignified his re&s;olution to &s;tay where he was, at
all events, without making him&s;elf accountable
to any per&s;on what&s;oever.</P>
<P>Peregrine &s;eeing him determined, de&s;i&s;ted from
any further importunity; re&s;olving, however, to
tire him out of his plan by re&s;erve and &s;uperci|lious
neglect; for he could not bear the thought
of being &s;o notoriou&s;ly obliged by any per&s;on upon
earth. With this view he quitted the lieute|nant,
upon &s;ome &s;light pretence; after having
told him, that he could not have the plea&s;ure of
his company at dinner, becau&s;e he was engaged
with a particular club of his fellow-pri&s;oners.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="259">
Jack was a &s;tranger to the punctilios of beha|viour,
and therefore did not take this declaration
$word$; but had immediate recour&s;e to the advice
of his coun&s;ellor Mr. Pipes, who propo&s;ed that
he &s;hould go to the coffee-hou&s;e and kitchen,
and give the people to under&s;tand that he would
pay for all &s;uch liquor and provi&s;ions as Mr.
Pickle &s;hould order to be &s;ent to his own lodging.
This expedient was immediately practi&s;ed; and,
as there was no credit in the place, Hatchway
depo&s;ited a &s;um of money, by way of &s;ecurity,
to the cook and the vi$tner, intimating, that
there was a nece&s;&s;ity for taking that method of
befriending his cou&s;in Peregrine, who was &s;ubject
to &s;trange whims, that rendered it impo&s;&s;ible to
&s;erve him any other way.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the&s;e in&s;inuations, it was
that &s;ame day rumoured about the Fleet, that
Mr. Pickle was an unhappy gentleman di&s;ordered
in his under&s;tanding, and that the lieutenant was
his near relation, who had &s;ubjected him&s;elf to
the inconvenience of living in a jail, with the
&s;ole view of keeping a &s;trict eye over his conduct.
This report, however, did not reach the ears of
our hero till next day, when he &s;ent one of the
runners of the Fleet, who attended him, to be|&s;peak
and pay for a couple of pullets, and &s;ome|thing
el&s;e, for dinner, to which he had already
invited his friend Hatchway, in hope of being
able to per&s;uade him to retire into the country,
after he had undergone a whole day's mortifica|tion
in the place. The me&s;&s;enger returned with
an a&s;&s;urance, that the dinner &s;hould be made ready
according to his directions, and re&s;tored the mo|ney,
ob&s;erving that his kin&s;man had paid for what
was be&s;poke.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="260">
Peregrine was equally &s;urprized and di&s;gu&s;ted
at this information, and re&s;olved to chide the
lieutenant &s;everely, for his un&s;ea&s;onable treat,
which he con&s;idered as a thing repugnant to his
reputation. Mean while, he di&s;patched his at|tendant
for wine to the coffee-hou&s;e, and finding
his credit bol&s;tered up in that place by the &s;ame
means, was enraged at the pre&s;umption of Jack's
friend&s;hip, and que&s;tioned the valet about it, with
&s;uch manife&s;tation of di&s;plea&s;ure, that the fellow,
afraid of di&s;obliging &s;uch a good ma&s;ter, frankly
communicated the &s;tory which was circulated at
his expence. The young gentleman was &s;o much
incen&s;ed at this piece of intelligence, that he
wrote a bitter expo&s;tulation to the lieutenant,
wherein he not only retracted his invitation, but
declared that he would never conver&s;e with him,
while he &s;hould remain within the place.</P>
<P>Having thus obeyed the dictates of his anger,
he gave notice to the cook, that he &s;hould not
have occa&s;ion for what was ordered; and repair|ing
to the coffee-hou&s;e, told the landlord, that
whereas he under&s;tood the &s;tranger with the
wooden leg had prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him and others with
ridiculous notions, tending to bring the &s;anity of
his intellects in que&s;tion; and, to confirm this
imputation, had, under the pretence of con&s;an|guinity,
undertaken to defray his expences; he
could not help (in ju&s;tice to him&s;elf) declaring,
that the lame per&s;on was, in reality, the madman,
who had given his keepers the &s;lip; that, there|fore,
he (the landlord) would not find his ac|count
in complying with his orders, and encou|raging
him to frequent his hou&s;e; and that, for
his own part, he would never enter the door, or
favour him with the lea&s;t trifle of his cu&s;tom, if
<PB N="255" REF="261">
ever he &s;hould, for the future, find him&s;elf an|ticipated
in his payments by that unhappy lu|natic.</P>
<P>The vintner was confounded at this retorted
charge; and, after much perplexity and delibe|ration,
concluded, that both parties were di&s;tract|ed;
the &s;tranger, in paying a man's debts again&s;t
his will, and Pickle, in being offended at &s;uch
forwardne&s;s of friend&s;hip.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The&s;e a&s;&s;ociates commit an a&s;&s;ault upon Crabtree,
for which they are bani&s;hed from the Fleet.
Peregrine begins to feel the effects of confine|ment.</HEAD>
<P>OUR adventurer having dined at the ordi|nary,
and in the afternoon retired to his
own apartment, as u&s;ual, with his friend Cad|wallader;
Hatchway and his a&s;&s;ociate, after they
had been obliged to di&s;cu&s;s the provi&s;ion for which
they had paid, renewed their conference upon
the old &s;ubject; and Pipes giving his me&s;s-mate
to under&s;tand, that Peregrine's chief confident
was the old deaf batchelor, whom he had &s;een at
his lodging the preceding day, Mr. Hatchway,
in his great penetration, di&s;covered, that the
young gentleman's ob&s;tinacy proceeded from the
advice of the Mi&s;anthrope, whom, for that rea|&s;on,
it was their bu&s;ine&s;s to cha&s;ti&s;e. Pipes en|tered
into this opinion the more willingly, as he
had all along believed the &s;enior to be a &s;ort of
wizzard, or &s;ome caco-daemon, whom it was not
very creditable to be acquainted with. Indeed,
he had been in&s;pired with this notion by the
<PB N="256" REF="262">
in&s;inuations of Hadgi, who had formerly dropped
&s;ome hints touching Crabtree's profound know|ledge
in the magic art; mentioning, in particu|lar,
his being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the philo&s;opher's &s;tone;
an a&s;&s;ertion to which Tom had given implicit
credit, until his ma&s;ter was &s;ent to pri&s;on for
debt, when he could no longer &s;uppo&s;e Cadwal|lader
lord of &s;uch a valuable &s;ecret, el&s;e he would
have certainly procured the enlargement of his
mo&s;t intimate friend.</P>
<P>With the&s;e &s;entiments he e&s;pou&s;ed the re&s;ent|ment
of Hatchway; and they determined to &s;eize
the &s;uppo&s;ed conjurer, with the fir&s;t opportunity,
on his return from his vi&s;it to Peregrine, and,
without he&s;itation, exerci&s;e upon him the di&s;ci|pline
of the pump. This plan they would have
executed that &s;ame evening, had not the mi&s;an|thrope
luckily withdrawn him&s;elf, by accident,
before it was dark, and even before they had in|telligence
of his retreat. But, next day, they
kept them&s;elves upon the watch 'till he appeared,
and Pipes lifting his hat, as Crabtree pa&s;&s;ed, &startq;O
damn ye, old Dunny (&s;aid he), you and I mu&s;t
grapple by and by; and, a'gad! I &s;hall lie &s;o near
your quarter, that your ear-ports will let in the
$ound, tho'f they were double caulked with
oakum.&endq;</P>
<P>The mi&s;anthrope's ears were not quite &s;o fa&s;t
clo&s;ed, but that they received this intimation;
which, tho' delivered in terms that he did not
well under&s;tand, had &s;uch an effect upon his ap|prehen&s;ion,
that he &s;ignified his doubts to Pere|grine,
ob&s;erving, that he did not much like the
looks of that &s;ame ruffian with the wooden leg.
Pickle a&s;&s;ured him, he had nothing to fear from
the two &s;ailors, who could have no cau&s;e of re|&s;entment
<PB N="257" REF="263">
again&s;t him; or, if they had, would not
venture to take any &s;tep, which they knew mu&s;t
block up all the avenues to that reconcilement,
about which they were &s;o anxious; and, more|over,
give &s;uch offence to the governor of the
place, as would infallibly induce him to expel
them both from his territories.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this a&s;&s;urance, the young gen|tleman
was not &s;o confident of the lieutenant's
di&s;cretion, as to believe that Crabtree's fears
were altogether without foundation: he forth|with
conjectured that Jack had taken umbrage
at an intimacy, from which he found him&s;elf
excluded, and imputed his di&s;grace to the in&s;i|nuations
of Cadwallader, whom, in all likelihood,
he intended to puni&s;h for his &s;uppo&s;ed advice.
He knew his friend could &s;u&s;tain no great damage
from the lieutenant's re&s;entment, in a place which
he could immediately alarm with his cries, and
therefore wi&s;hed he might fall into the &s;nare, be|cau&s;e
it would furni&s;h him with a pretence of
complaint; in con&s;equence of which, the &s;ailors
would be obliged to &s;hift their quarters, &s;o as that
he &s;hould be rid of their company, in which he
at pre&s;ent could find no enjoyment.</P>
<P>Every thing happened as he had fore&s;een; the
mi&s;anthrope, in his retreat from Peregrine's
chamber, was a&s;&s;aulted by Hatchway and his a&s;|&s;ociate,
who &s;eized him by the collar without
$$$mony, and began to drag him towards the
$word$, at which they would have certainly com|pl$mented
him with a very di&s;agreeable bath, had
$word$ he exalted his voice in &s;uch a manner, as in
a moment brought a number of the inhabitants,
and Pickle him&s;elf to his aid. The a&s;&s;ailants
would have per&s;i&s;ted in their de&s;ign, had the op|po&s;ition
<PB N="258" REF="264">
been &s;uch, as they could have faced with
any po&s;&s;ibility of &s;ucce&s;s; nor did they quit their
prey, before a dozen, at lea&s;t, had come to his
re&s;cue, and Peregrine, with a menacing a&s;pect
and air of authority, commanded his old valet to
withdraw: then they thought proper to &s;heer off,
and betake them&s;elves to clo&s;e quarters, while
our hero accompanied the affrighted Cadwallader
to the gate, and exhibited to the warden a formal
complaint again&s;t the rioters, upon whom he re|torted
the charge of lunacy, which was &s;upported
by the evidence of twenty per&s;ons, who had been
eye-witne&s;&s;es of the outrage committed again&s;t
the old gentleman.</P>
<P>The governor, in con&s;equence of this infor|mation,
&s;ent a me&s;&s;age to Mr. Hatchway, warn|ing
him to move his lodging next day, on pain
of being expelled; and the lieutenant contuma|ciou&s;ly
refu&s;ing to comply with this intimation,
was in the morning, while he amu&s;ed him&s;elf in
walking upon the bear, &s;uddenly &s;urrounded by
the con&s;tables of the court, who took him and
his adherent pri&s;oners, before they were aware,
and delivered them into the hands of the turn|keys,
by whom they were immediately di&s;mi&s;&s;ed,
and their baggage conveyed to the &s;ide of the
ditch.</P>
<P>This expul&s;ion was not performed without an
ob&s;tinate oppo&s;ition on the part of the delin|quents,
who, had they not been &s;urprized, would
have &s;et the whole Fleet at defiance, and, in all
probability, acted divers tragedies, before they
could have been over powered. Things being
circum&s;tanced as they were, the lieutenant did
not part with his conductor, without tweaking
his no&s;e, by way of farewel; and Pipes, in imi|tation
<PB N="259" REF="265">
of &s;uch a laudable example, communicated
a token of remembrance, in an application to the
&s;ole eye of his attendant, who, &s;corning to be
out-done in this kind of courte&s;y, returned the
compliment with &s;uch good will, that Tom's or|gan
performed the office of a multiplying gla&s;s.
The&s;e were mutual hints for &s;tripping; and ac|cordingly,
each was naked from the wai&s;t up|wards
in a trice. A ring of butchers from the
market was immediately formed; a couple of the
reverend Flamens, who, in morning-gowns, ply
for marriages in that quarter of the town, con|&s;tituted
them&s;elves &s;econds and umpires of the
approaching conte&s;t, and the battle began with|out
further preparation. The combatants were,
in point of &s;trength and agility, pretty equally
matched; but the jailor had been regularly train|ed
to the art of brui&s;ing: he had more than once
&s;ignalized him&s;elf in public, for his prowe&s;s and
$word$ in this exerci&s;e, and lo&s;t one eye upon the
&s;tage, in the cour&s;e of his exploits. This was a
misfortune of which Pipes did not fail to take the
advantage: he had already &s;u&s;tained &s;everal hard
knocks upon his temples and jaw$$ and found it
impracticable to &s;mite his antagoni&s;t upon the
$$$tualling-office, &s;o dexterou&s;ly was it defended
again&s;t a&s;&s;ault: upon which he changed his bat|tery,
and being ambi-dexter, rai&s;ed &s;uch a clatter
upon the turnkey's blind &s;ide, that this hero, be|lieving
him left-handed, converted his attention
that way, and oppo&s;ed the unenlightened &s;ide of
$word$ face to the right-hand of Pipes, which being
thus unprovided again&s;t, &s;lily be&s;towed upon him
a peg under the fifth rib, that in an in&s;tant laid
him &s;en&s;ele&s;s on the pavement, at the feet of his
$$$queror, who was congratulated upon his vic|tory,
<PB N="260" REF="266">
not only by his friend Hatchway, but al&s;o
by all the by-&s;tanders, particularly the prie&s;t who
had e&s;pou&s;ed his cau&s;e, and now invited the
&s;trangers to his lodging in a neighbouring ale|hou&s;e,
where they were entertained &s;o much to
their liking, that they determined to &s;eek no
other habitation while they &s;hould continue in
town: and notwith&s;tanding the di&s;grace and di&s;|couragement
they had met with, in their endea|vours
to &s;erve our adventurer, they were &s;till re|&s;olved
to per&s;evere in their good offices, or, in
the vulgar phra&s;e, to &s;ee him out.</P>
<P>While they &s;ettled them&s;elves in this manner,
and acquired familiar connexions round all the
purlieus of the dit$h, Peregrine found him&s;elf
deprived of the company of Cadwallader, who
&s;ignified by letter, that he did not chu&s;e to ha|zard
his per&s;on again in vi&s;iting him, while &s;uch
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins occupied the avenues through which he
mu&s;t pa&s;s; for he had been at pains to inquire
into the motions of the &s;eamen, and informed
him&s;elf exactly of the harbour in which they
were moored.</P>
<P>Our hero had been &s;o much accu&s;tomed to the
conver&s;ation of Crabtree, which was altogether
&s;uitable to the &s;ingularity of his own di&s;po&s;ition,
that he could very ill afford to be debarred of it
at this juncture, when almo&s;t every other &s;ource
of enjoyment was &s;topped. He was, however,
obliged to &s;ubmit to the hard&s;hips of his &s;itua|tion;
and as the characters of his fellow-pri|&s;oners
did not at all improve upon him, he was
compelled to &s;eek for &s;atisfaction within him&s;elf.
Not but that he had an opportunity of conver&s;ing
with &s;ome people, who neither wanted &s;en&s;e, nor
were deficient in point of principle; yet there
<PB N="261" REF="267">
appeared in the behaviour of them all, without
exception, a certain want of decorum, a &s;qualor
o$ &s;entiment, a &s;ort of jaili&s;h ca&s;t contracted in
the cour&s;e of confinement, which di&s;gu&s;ted the
delicacy of our hero's ob&s;ervation. He, therefore,
detached him&s;elf from their parties as much as he
could, without giving offence to tho&s;e among
whom he was obliged to live, and re&s;umed his
labours with incredible eagerne&s;s and per&s;e|verance,
his &s;pirits being &s;upported by the &s;ucce&s;s
of &s;ome &s;evere <HI>Philippi$s,</HI> which he occa&s;ionally
publi&s;hed again&s;t the author of his misfortune.</P>
<P>Nor was his humanity unemployed in the va|cations
of his revenge: a man mu&s;t be void of all
&s;ympathy and compa&s;&s;ion, who can re&s;ide among
&s;o many mi&s;erable objects, without feeling an in|clination
to relieve their di&s;tre&s;s. Every day almo&s;t
pre&s;ented to his view &s;uch lamentable &s;cenes, as
were mo&s;t likely to attract his notice, and en|gage
his benevolence. Rever&s;es of fortune, at|tended
with the mo&s;t deplorable circum&s;tances of
dome&s;tic woe, were continually intruding upon
his acquaintance; his ears were invaded with the
cries of the haple&s;s wi$e, who from the enjoy|ment
of affluence and plea&s;ure, was forced to
follow her hu&s;band to this abode of wretchedne&s;s
and want; his eyes were every minute a&s;&s;ailed
with the naked and meagre appearances of hunger
and cold; and his fancy teemed with a thou&s;and
aggravations of their mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Thus &s;ituated, his pur&s;e was never &s;hut, while
his heart remained open. Without reflecting up|on
the &s;lenderne&s;s of his &s;tore, he exerci&s;ed his
charity to all the children of di&s;tre&s;s, and acquired
a popularity which, though plea&s;ing, was far
$word$ being profitable. In &s;hort, his bounty kept
<PB N="262" REF="268">
no pace with his circum&s;tances, and in a little
time he was utterly exhau&s;ted. He had recour&s;e
to his book&s;eller, from whom, with great diffi|culty,
be obtained a &s;mall reinforcement; and
immediately relap&s;ed into the &s;ame want of re|tention.
He was con&s;cious of his infirmity, and
found it incurable: he fore&s;aw, that by his own
indu&s;try he &s;hould never be able to defray the
expence of the&s;e occa&s;ions; and this reflection
&s;unk deep into his mind: the approbation of the
public, which he had earned or might acquire,
like a cordial often repeated, began to lo&s;e its
effect upon his imagination; his health &s;uffered
by his &s;edentary life and au&s;tere application; his
eye-&s;ight failed, his appetite for&s;ook him, his &s;pi|rits
decayed; &s;o that he became melancholy, li&s;t|le&s;s,
and altogether incapable of pro&s;ecuting the
only means he had left for his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; and
(what did not at all contribute to the alleviation
of the&s;e particulars) he was given to under&s;tand
by his lawyer, that he had lo&s;t his cau&s;e, and
was condemned in co&s;ts. Even this was not
the mo&s;t mortifying piece of intelligence he re|ceived;
he at the &s;ame time learn'd, that his
book&s;eller was bankrupt, and his friend Crabtree
at the point of death.</P>
<P>The&s;e were comfortable con&s;iderations to a
youth of Peregrine's di&s;po&s;ition, which was &s;o
capricious, that the more his mi&s;ery increa&s;ed,
the more haughty and inflexible he became.
Rather than be beholden to Hatchway, who &s;till
hovered about the gate, eager for an opportunity
to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, he cho&s;e to undergo the want o$
almo&s;t every convenience of life, and actually
pledged his wearing-apparel to an Iri&s;h pawn|broker
in the Fleet, for money to purcha&s;e tho&s;e
<PB N="263" REF="269">
things, without which he mu&s;t have ab&s;olutely
peri&s;hed. He was gradually irritated by his mi&s;|fortunes
into a rancorous re&s;entment again&s;t man|kind
in general, and his heart &s;o alienated from
the enjoyments of life, that he did not care how
&s;oon he quitted his mi&s;erable exi&s;tence. Though
he had &s;hocking examples of the vici&s;&s;itudes of
fortune continually before his eyes, he could ne|ver
be reconciled to the idea of living like his
fellow-&s;ufferers, in the mo&s;t abject degree of de|pendance.
If he refu&s;ed to accept of favours
from his own allies and intimate friends, whom
he had formerly obliged, it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed
that he would li&s;ten to propo&s;als of that kind
from any of his fellow-pri&s;oners, with whom he
had contracted acquaintance: he was even more
cautious than ever of incurring obligations; he
now &s;hunned his former me&s;s-mates, in order to
avoid di&s;agreeable tenders of friend&s;hip; and ima|gining
that he perceived an inclination in the
clergyman, to learn the &s;tate of his finances, he
di&s;couraged and declined the explanation, and
at length &s;ecluded him&s;elf from all &s;ociety.</P>

<P>WHILE he pined in this forlorn condi|tion,
with an equal abhorrence of the
world and him&s;elf, captain Gauntlet arrived in
town, in order to employ his intere&s;t for pro|motion
in the army; and, in con&s;equence of his
wife's particular de&s;ire, made it his bu&s;ine&s;s to
inquire for Peregrine, to whom he longed to be

reconciled, even at the expence of a &s;light &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion.
But he could hear no tidings of him,
at the place to which he was directed; and, on
the &s;uppo&s;ition that our hero had gone to re&s;ide
in the country, applied him&s;elf to his own bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
with intention to renew his enquiries, af|ter
that affair &s;hould be tran&s;acted. He commu|nicated
his demands to his &s;uppo&s;ed patron, who
had a&s;&s;umed the merit of making him a captain,
and been gratified with a valuable pre&s;ent on that
con&s;ideration; and was cajoled with hopes of &s;uc|ceeding
in his pre&s;ent aim, by the &s;ame intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Mean while, he became acquainted with one
of the clerks belonging to the war office, who&s;e
advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he was told, would be a
furtherance to his &s;cheme; and as he had occa&s;ion
to di&s;cour&s;e with this gentleman, upon the cir|cum&s;tances
of his expectation, he learned that
the nobleman, upon whom he depended, was a
per&s;on of no con&s;equence in the &s;tate, and alto|gether
incapable of a&s;&s;i&s;ting him in his advance|ment.
At the &s;ame time, his coun&s;ellor ex|pre&s;&s;ed
his &s;urprize that captain Gauntlet did not
rather intere&s;t in his cau&s;e the noble peer, to
who&s;e good offices he owed his la&s;t commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>This remark introduced an explanation, by
which Godfrey di&s;covered, to his infinite a&s;to|ni&s;hment,
the mi&s;take in which he had continued
&s;o long, with regard to his patron; tho' he could
not divine the motive which induced a nobleman,
with whom he had no acquaintance or connec|tion,
to interpo&s;e his influence in his behalf.
What&s;oever that might be, he thought it was his
duty to make his acknowledgment; and for that
purpo&s;e, went next morning to his hou&s;e, where
he was politely received, and given to under&s;tand,
<PB N="265" REF="271">
that Mr. Pickle was the per&s;on to who&s;e friend|&s;hip
he was indebted for his la&s;t promotion.</P>
<P>Inexpre&s;&s;ible were the tran&s;ports of gratitude,
affection, and remor&s;e, that took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
the &s;oul of Gauntlet, when this my&s;tery was un|folded.
&startq;Good heaven! (cried he, lifting up
his hands) have I lived &s;o long in a &s;tate of ani|mo&s;ity
with my benefactor? I intended to have
reconciled my&s;elf to him, at any rate, before I
was &s;en&s;ible of this obligation; but now I &s;hall
not enjoy a moment's quiet, until I have an op|portunity
of expre&s;&s;ing to him my &s;en&s;e of his
heroic friend&s;hip. I pre&s;ume, from the nature of
the favour conferred upon him, in my behalf,
that Mr. Pickle is well known to your lord&s;hip;
and I &s;hould think my&s;elf extremely happy, if
you could inform me in what part of the coun|try
he is to be found: for the per&s;on with whom
$word$ lodged, &s;ome time ago, could give me no in|telligence
of his motions.&endq;</P>
<P>The nobleman, touched with this in&s;tance of
generous &s;elf-denial in Peregrine, as well as with
the &s;en&s;ibility of his friend, lamented the unhap|pine&s;s
of our hero, while he gave Gau$tlet to
under&s;tand that he had been long di&s;ordered in
his intellects, in con&s;equence of having &s;quan|dered
away his fortune; and that his creditors
had thrown him into the Fleet-pri&s;on: but whe|ther
he &s;till continued in that confinement, or
was relea&s;ed from his misfortunes by death, his
lord&s;hip did not know, becau&s;e he had never
enquired.</P>
<P>Godfrey no &s;ooner received this intimation,
than (his blood boiling with grief and impatience)
$e craved pardon for his abrupt departure; and
$word$ his informer on the in$$ant, r$$mbarked
<PB N="266" REF="272">
in his hackney-coach, and ordered him&s;elf to be
conveyed directly to the Fleet. As the vehicle
proceeded along one &s;ide of the market, he was
&s;urpri&s;ed with the appearance of Hatchway and
Pipes, who &s;tood cheapening collyflowers at a
green-&s;tall, their heads being ca&s;ed in wor&s;ted
night-caps, half covered with their hats, and a
&s;hort tobacco-pipe in the mouth of each. He
was rejoiced at &s;ight of the two &s;eamen, which
he took for an happy omen of finding his friend;
and, ordering the coachman to &s;top the carriage,
called to the lieutenant by his name. Jack re|plying
with an <HI>Hilloah,</HI> looked behind him, and
recognizing the face of his old acquaintance, ran
up to the coach with great eagerne&s;s, and &s;haking
the captain heartily by the hand, &startq;Odd's heart!
(&s;aid he) I'm glad thou ha'&s;t fallen in with us:
we &s;hall now be able to find the trim of the ve&s;|&s;el,
and lay her about on the other tack. For
my own part, I have had many a con&s;ort in my
time, that is, in the way of good-fellow&s;hip, and
I always made &s;hift to ware 'em at one time or
another: but this head&s;trong toad will neither
obey the helm nor the &s;heet; and, for aught I
know, will founder where he lies at anchor.&endq;</P>
<P>Gauntlet, who conceived part of his meaning,
alighted immediately; and being conducted to
the &s;ailor's lodging, was informed of every thing
that had pa&s;&s;ed between the lieutenant and Pickle.
He, in his turn, communicated to Jack the di&s;|covery
which he had made, with regard to his
commi&s;&s;ion; at which the other gave no &s;igns of
&s;urprize: but taking the pipe from his mouth,
&startq;Why, look ye, captain, (&s;aid he) that's not
the only good turn you have owed him. That
&s;ame money you received from the commodore,
<PB N="267" REF="273">
as an old debt, was all a &s;ham, contrived by
Pickle for your &s;ervice; but a' wool drive under
his bare poles, without &s;ails and rigging, or a
me&s;s of provi&s;ion on board, rather than take the
&s;ame a&s;&s;i&s;tance from another man.&endq;</P>
<P>Godfrey was not only amazed, but chagrined
at the knowledge of this anecdote; which gave
umbrage to his pride, while it &s;timulated his de|&s;ire
of doing &s;omething in return for the obliga|tion.
He enquired into the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances
of the pri&s;oner; and under&s;tanding that he was
indi&s;po&s;ed, and but indifferently provided with
the common nece&s;&s;aries of life, tho' &s;till deaf to
all offers of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, began to be extremely
concerned at the account of his &s;avage ob&s;tinacy
and pride, which would, he feared, exclude him
from the privilege of relieving him in his di&s;tre&s;s.
However, he re&s;olved to leave no expedient un|tried,
that might have any tendency to &s;urmount
&s;uch de&s;tructive prejudice; and, entering the jail,
was directed to the apartment of the wretched
pri&s;oner. He knocked &s;oftly at the door, and
when it was opened, &s;tarted back with horror
and a&s;toni&s;hment: the figure that pre&s;ented it&s;elf
to his view, was the remains of his once happy
friend; but &s;o mi&s;erably altered and di&s;gui&s;ed,
that his features were &s;carce cognizable. The
florid, the &s;prightly, the gay, the elevated youth,
was now metamorpho&s;ed into a wan, dejected,
meagre, &s;qualid &s;pectre; the hollow-eyed repre|&s;entative
of di&s;temper, indigence and de&s;pair:
yet his eyes retained a certain ferocity, which
threw a di&s;mal gleam athwart the cloudine&s;s of
his a&s;pect, and he, in &s;ilence, viewed his old
companion with a look betokening confu&s;ion and
di&s;dain. As for Gauntlet, he could not, with|out
<PB N="268" REF="274">
emotion, behold &s;uch a woful rever&s;e of fate,
in a per&s;on for whom he entertained the noble&s;t
&s;entiments of friend&s;hip, gratitude and e&s;teem:
his &s;orrow was at fir&s;t too big for utterance, and
he &s;hed a flood of tears before he could pronounce
one word.</P>
<P>Peregrine, in &s;pite of his mi&s;anthropy, could
not help being affected with this uncommon te&s;|timony
of regard; but he &s;trove to &s;tifle his &s;en|&s;ations:
his brows contracted them&s;elves into a
&s;everer $rown, his eyes kindled into the appear|ance
of live coals; he waved with his hand, in
&s;ignal for Godfrey to be gone, and leave &s;uch a
wretch as him to the mi&s;eries of his fate; and
finding nature too &s;trong to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, uttered
a deep groan, and wept aloud.</P>
<P>The &s;oldier, &s;eeing him thus melted, unable
to re&s;train the &s;trong impul&s;e of his affection,
$word$ forwards, and cla&s;ping him in his arms,
&startq;My deare&s;t friend, and be&s;t benefactor, (&s;aid
he) I am come hither to humble my&s;elf for the
offence I was &s;o unhappy as to give, at our la&s;t
parting; to beg a reconciliation, to thank you
for the ea&s;e and affluence I have enjoyed through
your means, and to re&s;cue you, in &s;pite of your|&s;elf,
from this melancholy &s;ituation; of which,
but an hour ago, I was utterly ignorant. Do not
deny me the &s;atisfaction of acquitting my&s;elf, in
point of duty and obligation. You mu&s;t cer|tainly
have had &s;ome regard for a per&s;on, in
who&s;e favour you have exerted your&s;elf &s;o much;
and if any part of that e&s;teem remains, you will
not refu&s;e him an opportunity of approving him|&s;elf,
in &s;ome mea&s;ure, worthy of it. Let me
not &s;uffer the mo&s;t mortifying of all repul&s;es,
that of &s;lighted friend&s;hip; but kindly &s;acrifice
<PB N="269" REF="275">
your re&s;entment and inflexibility to the reque&s;t of
one, who is at all times ready to &s;acrifice his
life for your honour and advantage. If you will
not yield to my intreaties, have &s;ome regard to
the wi&s;hes of my Sophy, who laid me under the
&s;tronge&s;t injunctions to &s;olicit your forgivene&s;s,
even before &s;he knew how much I was indebted
to your genero&s;ity; or, if that con&s;ideration
&s;hould be of no weight, I hope you will relax a
little for the &s;ake of poor Emilia, who&s;e re&s;ent|ment
hath been long &s;ubdued by her affection,
and who now droops in &s;ecret at your neglect.&endq;</P>
<P>Every word of this addre&s;s, delivered in the
mo&s;t pathetic manner, made an impre&s;&s;ion upon
the mind of Peregrine: he was affected with the
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of his friend, who, in reality, had
given him no ju&s;t cau&s;e to complain. He knew
that no ordinary motive had &s;wayed him to a
conde&s;cen&s;ion, &s;o extraordinary in a man of his
punctilious temper: he con&s;idered it, therefore,
as the genuine effect of eager gratitude and di&s;|intere&s;ted
love, and his heart began to relent ac|cordingly.
When he heard him&s;elf conjured in
the name of the gentle Sophy, his ob&s;tinacy was
quite overcome; and when Emilia was recalled
to his remembrance, his whole frame underwent
a violent agitation. He took his friend by the
hand, with a &s;oftened look; and &s;oon as he re|covered
the faculty of &s;peech, which had been
overpowered in the conflict of pa&s;&s;ions that tran&s;|ported
him, prote&s;ted, that he retained no ve&s;|tige
of animo&s;ity, but con&s;idered him in the light
of an affectionate comrade, the ties of who&s;e
friend&s;hip, adver&s;ity could not unbind. He men|tioned
Sophy in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful terms; &s;poke
of Emilia with the mo&s;t reverential awe, as the
<PB N="270" REF="276">
object of his inviolable love and veneration; but
di&s;claimed all hope of ever more attracting her
regard; and excu&s;ed him&s;elf from profiting by
Godfrey's kind intention, declaring, with a re|&s;olute
air, that he had broke off all connection
with mankind, and that he impatiently longed
for the hour of his di&s;&s;olution, which, if it &s;hould
not &s;oon arrive by the cour&s;e of nature, he was
re&s;olved to ha&s;ten with his own hands, rather
than be expo&s;ed to the contempt, and more in|tolerable
pity, of a ra&s;cally world.</P>
<P>Gauntlet argued again&s;t this frantic determi|nation
with all the vehemence of expo&s;tulating
friend&s;hip; but his remon&s;trances did not produce
the de&s;ired effect upon our de&s;perate hero, who
calmly refuted all his arguments, and a&s;&s;erted the
rectitude of his de&s;ign from the pretended maxims
of rea&s;on and true philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>While this di&s;pute was carried on with eager|ne&s;s
on one &s;ide, and deliberation on the other,
a letter was brought to Peregrine, who threw it
carele&s;ly a&s;ide unopened, tho' the &s;uper&s;cription
was in an hand-writing to which he was a
&s;tranger; and, in all probability, the contents
would never have been peru&s;ed, had not Gaunt|let
in&s;i&s;ted upon his waving all ceremony, and
reading it forthwith. Thus &s;olicited, Pickle un|&s;ealed
the billet, which, to his no &s;mall &s;urprize,
contained the following intimation:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>Mr. P. Pickle,
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS comes to inform you, that, after many
dangers and di&s;appointments, I am, by the
ble&s;&s;ing of God, &s;afely arrived in the Downs, on
<PB N="271" REF="277">
board of the Gomberoon Indiaman, having
made a tolerable voyage; by which I hope I &s;hall
be enabled to repay, with intere&s;t, the &s;even
hundred pounds which I borrowed of you before
my departure from England. I take this oppor|tunity
of writing by our pur&s;er, who goes expre&s;s
with di&s;patches for the company, that you may
have this &s;atisfactory notice, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible,
relating to one whom I &s;uppo&s;e you have long
given over as lo&s;t. I have inclo&s;ed it in a letter
to my broker, who, I hope, knows your addre&s;s,
and will forward it accordingly: and I am, with
re&s;pect, Sir,</P>
<CLOSER>Your mo&s;t humble &s;ervant,
<SIGNED>Benjamin Chintz.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>He had no &s;ooner taken a cur&s;ory view of this
agreeable epi&s;tle, than his countenance cleared
up, and reaching it to his friend, with a &s;mile,
&startq;There (&s;aid he) is a more convincing argu|ment,
on your &s;ide of the que&s;tion, than all the
$a&s;ui&s;ts in the univer&s;e can advance.&endq; Gauntlet,
wondering at this ob&s;ervation, took the paper,
and ca&s;ting his eyes greedily upon the contents,
congratulated him upon the receit of it, with
extravagant demon&s;trations of joy: &startq;Not on
account of the &s;um (&s;aid he) which, upon my
honour, I would, with plea&s;ure, pay three times
over for your convenience and &s;atisfaction; but
becau&s;e it &s;eems to have reconciled you to life,
and di&s;po&s;ed your mind for re-enjoying the com|forts
of &s;ociety.&endq;</P>
<P>The in&s;tantaneous effect which this unexpected
&s;mile of fortune produced in the appearance of
our adventurer, is altogether inconceivable! it
<PB N="272" REF="278">
plumped up his cheeks in a moment, unbended
and enlightened every feature of his face; ele|vated
his head, which had begun to &s;ink, as it
were, between his &s;houlders; and from a &s;queak|ing,
di&s;pirited tone, &s;welled up his voice to a
clear, manly accent. Godfrey, taking advan|tage
of this favourable change, began to regale
him with pro&s;pects of future &s;ucce&s;s: he reminded
him of his youth and qualifications, which were
certainly de&s;igned for better days than tho&s;e he
had as yet &s;een; he pointed out various paths,
by which he might arrive at wealth and reputa|tion;
he importuned him to accept of a &s;um
for his immediate occa&s;ions; and earne&s;tly begged,
that he would allow him to di&s;charge the debt
for which he was confined: ob&s;erving, that
Sophy's fortune had enabled him to exhibit that
proof of his gratitude, without any detriment to
his affairs; and prote&s;ting, that he &s;hould not
believe him&s;elf in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mr. Pickle's
e&s;teem, unle&s;s he was permitted to make &s;ome
&s;uch return of good-will to the man, who had
not only rai&s;ed him from indigence and &s;corn to
competence and reputable rank, but al&s;o im|powered
him to obtain the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an excel|lent
woman, who had filled up the mea&s;ure of
his felicity.</P>
<P>Peregrine declared him&s;elf already overpaid for
all his good offices, by the plea&s;ure he enjoyed
in employing them, and the happy effects they
had produced, in the mutual &s;atisfaction of two
per&s;ons &s;o dear to his affection; and a&s;&s;ured his
friend, that one time or other he would &s;et his
con&s;cience at ea&s;e, and remove the &s;cruples of
his honour, by having recour&s;e to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance:
but, at pre&s;ent, he could not make u&s;e of his
<PB N="273" REF="279">
friend&s;hip, without giving ju&s;t cau&s;e of offence
to hone&s;t Hatchway, who was prior to him in
point of &s;olicitation, and had manife&s;ted his at|tachment
with &s;urpri&s;ing ob&s;tinacy and per|&s;everance.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="110" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. CX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Peregrine reconciles him&s;elf to the lieutenant; and
renews his connection with &s;ociety. Divers plans
are projected in his behalf; and he has occa&s;ion
to exhibit a remarkable proof of &s;elf-denial.</HEAD>
<P>THE captain, with reluctance, yielded the
preference in this particular to Jack, who
was immediately invited to a conference, by a
note &s;ub&s;cribed with Pickle's own hand. He was
found at the pri&s;on-gate waiting for Gauntlet, to
know the i&s;&s;ue of his negotiation; and no &s;ooner
received this &s;ummons than he &s;et all his &s;ails,
and made the be&s;t of his way to his friend's
apartment; being admitted by the turnkey, in
con&s;equence of Peregrine's reque&s;t, communi|cated
by the me&s;&s;enger who carried the billet.
Pipes followed clo&s;e in the wake of his &s;hip|mate;
and, in a few minutes after the note had
been di&s;patched, Peregrine and Gauntlet hea$d
the &s;ound of the &s;tump, a&s;cending the wooden
&s;tair-ca&s;e with &s;uch velocity, that they at fir&s;t
mi&s;took it for the application of drum-&s;ticks to
the head of an empty barrel. This uncommon
&s;peed, however, was attended with a misfortune:
he chanced to overlook a &s;mall defect in one of
the &s;teps, and, his prop plunging into a hole, he
&s;ell backwards, to the imminent danger of his
life. Tom was luckily at his back, and &s;u&s;tained
<PB N="274" REF="280">
him in his arms, &s;o as that he e&s;caped without
any other damage than the lo&s;s of his wooden
leg, which was &s;napt in the middle, by the weight
of his body, in falling: and &s;uch was his impa|tience,
that he would not give him&s;elf the
trouble to di&s;engage the fractured member; but
unbuckling the whole equipage in a trice, left it
&s;ticking in the crevice, &s;aying a rotten cable was
not worth heaving up, and, in this natural &s;tate
of mutilation, hopp'd into the room with infi|nite
expedition.</P>
<P>Peregrine taking him cordially by the hand,
&s;eated him upon one &s;ide of his bed; and after
having made an apology for that re&s;erve, of which
he had &s;o ju&s;tly complained, a&s;ked, if he could
conveniently accommodate him with the loan of
twenty guineas. The lieutenant, without open|ing
his mouth, pulled out his pur&s;e; and Pipes,
who overheard the demand, applying the whi&s;tle
to his lips, performed a loud overture, in token
of his joy. Matters being thus brought to an
accommodation, our hero told the captain, that
he &s;hould be glad of his company at dinner, with
their common friend Hatchway, if he would in
the mean time leave him to the mini&s;try of Pipes;
and the &s;oldier went away for the pre&s;ent, in
order to pay a &s;hort vi&s;it to his uncle, who, at
that time, langui&s;hed in a declining &s;tate of
health, promi&s;ing to return at the appointed
hour.</P>
<P>The lieutenant, having &s;urvey'd the di&s;mal
appearance of his friend, could not help being
moved at the &s;pectacle, and began to upbraid him
wi$h his ob&s;tinate pride, which (he &s;wore) was
no better than &s;elf-murder. But the young gen|tleman
interrupted him in the cour&s;e of his mo|ralizing,
<PB N="275" REF="281">
by telling him he had rea&s;ons for his
conduct, which, perhaps, he &s;hould impart in
due &s;ea&s;on; but, at pre&s;ent, his de&s;ign was to
alter that plan of behaviour, and make him&s;elf
&s;ome amends for the mi&s;ery he had undergone.
He accordingly &s;ent Pipes to redeem his cloaths
from the pawnbroker's wardrobe, and be&s;peak
&s;omething comfortable for dinner. And when
Godfrey came back, he was very agreeably &s;ur|pri&s;ed
to &s;ee &s;uch a favourable alteration in his
externals; for, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his valet, he
had purified him&s;elf from the dregs of his di&s;tre&s;s,
and now appeared in a decent &s;uit, with clean
linnen, while his face was di&s;encumbered of the
hair that over&s;hadowed it, and his apartment
prepared for the reception of company.</P>
<P>They enjoyed their meal with great &s;atisfac|tion,
entertaining one another with a recapitu|lation
of their former adventures at the gari&s;on;
and in the afternoon, Gauntlet taking his leave,
in order to write a letter to his &s;i&s;ter, at the de&s;ire
of his uncle, who finding his end approaching,
wanted to &s;ee her without lo&s;s of time, Peregrine
made his appearance on the bear, and was com|plimented
on his coming abroad again, not only
by his old me&s;s-mates, who had not &s;een him for
many weeks, but by a number of tho&s;e objects
whom his liberality had fed, before his funds
were exhau&s;ted. Hatchway was, by his intere&s;t
with the warden, put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his former
quarters, and Pipes di&s;patched to make inqui|ry
about Crabtree at his former lodging, where
he learn'd, that the Mi&s;anthrope, after a very
&s;evere fit of illne&s;s, was removed to Ken&s;ington
Gravel-pits, for the convenience of breathing a
purer air than that of London.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="282">
In con&s;equence of this information, Peregrine,
who knew the narrowne&s;s of the old gentleman's
fortune, next day de&s;ired his friend Gauntlet to
take the trouble of vi&s;iting him, in his name,
with a letter, in which he expre&s;&s;ed great con|cern
for his indi&s;po&s;ition, gave him notice of the
fortunate intelligence he had received from the
Downs, and conjured him to make u&s;e of his
pur&s;e, if he was in the lea&s;t hampered in his cir|cum&s;tances.
The captain took coach imme|diately,
and &s;et out for the place, according to
the direction which Pipes had procured.</P>
<P>Cadwallader having &s;een him at Bath, knew
him again at fir&s;t &s;ight; and, though reduced to
a &s;keleton, believed him&s;elf in &s;uch a fair way of
doing well, that he would have accompanied him
to the Fleet immediately, had not he been re|&s;trained
by his nur&s;e, who had been, by his phy|&s;ician,
inve&s;ted with full authority to di&s;pute and
oppo&s;e his will, in every thing that &s;he &s;hould
think prejudicial to his health; for he was con|&s;idered,
by tho&s;e who had the care of him, as
an old humouri&s;t, not a little di&s;tempered in his
brain&punc; He inquired particularly about the &s;ailors,
who (he &s;aid) had deterred him from carrying
on his u&s;ual corre&s;pondence with Pickle, and
been the immediate cau&s;e of his indi&s;po&s;ition, by
terrifying him into a &s;ever: and under&s;tanding
that the breach between Pickle and Hatchway
was happily cemented, and that he was no longer
in any danger from the lieutenant's re&s;entment, he
promi&s;ed to be at the Fleet with the fir&s;t conve|nient
opportunity; and, in the mean time, wrote
an an&s;wer to Peregrine's letter, importing, that
he was obliged to him for his offer, but had not
the lea&s;t occa&s;ion for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="283">
In a few days, our adventurer recovered his
vigour, complexion and vivacity; he mingled
again in the diver&s;ions and parties of the place;
he received, in a little time, the money he had
lent upon bottomry, which, together with the
intere&s;t, amounted to upwards of eleven hundred
pounds. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this &s;um, while it
buoyed up his &s;pirits, involved him in perplexity.
Sometimes he thought it was incumbent upon
him, as a man of honour, to employ the greate&s;t
part of it, in dimini&s;hing the debt for which he
&s;uffered; on the other hand, he con&s;idered that
obligation effaced, by the treacherous behaviour
of his creditor, who had injured him to ten times
the value of the &s;um; and in the&s;e &s;entiments,
entertained thoughts of attempting his e&s;cape
from pri&s;on, with a view of conveying him&s;elf,
with the &s;hipwreck of his fortune, to another
country, in which he might u&s;e it to better ad|vantage.</P>
<P>Both &s;ugge&s;tions were attended with &s;uch
doubts and difficulties, that he he&s;itated between
them, and for the pre&s;ent, laid out a thou&s;and
pounds in &s;tock, the intere&s;t of which, together
with the fruits of his own indu&s;try, he hoped,
would &s;upport him above want in his confine|ment,
until &s;omething &s;hould occur, that would
point out the expediency of &s;ome other deter|mination.
Gauntlet &s;till in&s;i&s;ted upon having
the honour of obtaining his liberty, at the ex|pence
of taking up his notes to Gleanum, and ex|horted
him to purcha&s;e a commi&s;&s;ion with part
of the money which he had retrieved. The lieu|tenant
affirmed, that it was his privilege to pro|cure
the relea&s;e of his cou&s;in Pickle, becau&s;e he
enjoyed a very hand&s;ome &s;um by his aunt, which
<PB N="278" REF="284">
of right belonged to the young gentleman, to
whom he was, moreover, indebted for the u&s;e
of his furniture, and for the very hou&s;e that
&s;tood over his head; and that, although he had
already made a will in his favour, he &s;hould never
be &s;atisfied, nor ea&s;y in his mind, &s;o long as he
remained deprived of his liberty, and wanted any
of the conveniences of life.</P>
<P>Cadwallader, who by this time a&s;&s;i&s;ted at their
councils, and was be&s;t acquainted with the pecu|liarity
and unbending di&s;po&s;ition of the youth,
propo&s;ed, that &s;eeing he was &s;o aver&s;e to obliga|tions,
Mr. Hatchway &s;hould purcha&s;e of him
the gari&s;on with its appendages, which, at a
moderate price, would &s;ell for more money than
would be &s;ufficient to di&s;charge his debts; and
that, if the &s;ervile &s;ubordination of the army
did not &s;uit his inclinations, he might, with his
rever&s;ion, buy a comfortable annuity, and retire
with him to the country, where he might live
ab&s;olutely independent, and entertain him&s;elf, as
u&s;ual, with the ridiculous characters of mankind.</P>
<P>This plan was, to Pickle, le&s;s di&s;agreeable than
any other project which had as yet been &s;ugge&s;ted;
and the lieutenant declared him&s;elf ready to exe|cute
his part of it, without delay: but the &s;ol|dier
was mortified at the thoughts of &s;eeing his
a&s;&s;i&s;tance unnece&s;&s;ary, and eagerly objected to the
retirement, as a &s;cheme that would bla&s;t the
faire&s;t promi&s;es of fame and fortune, and bury
his youth and talents in &s;olitude and ob&s;curity.
This earne&s;t oppo&s;ition on the part of Gauntlet,
hindered our adventurer from forming any imme|diate
re&s;olution; which was al&s;o retarded by his
unwillingne&s;s to part with the garri&s;on upon any
terms, becau&s;e he looked upon it as a part of his
<PB N="279" REF="285">
inheritance, which he could not di&s;po&s;e of, with|out
committing an in&s;ult upon the memory of
the decea&s;ed commodore.</P>

<DIV2 N="111" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. CXI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">He is engaged in a very extraordinary corre&s;pon|dence,
which is interrupted by a very unexpected
event.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE this affair was in agitation, the
captain told him, in the cour&s;e of con|ver&s;ation,
that Emilia was arrived in town, and
had enquired about Mr. Pickle with &s;uch an
eagerne&s;s of concern, as &s;eemed to proclaim that
&s;he was in &s;ome mea&s;ure informed of his misfor|tune:
he, therefore, de&s;ired to know if he might
be allowed to make her acquainted with his &s;itua|tion,
provided he &s;hould be again importuned by
her on that &s;ubject, which he had at fir&s;t indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly
waved.</P>
<P>This proof, or rather pre&s;umption of her &s;ym|pathi&s;ing
regard, did not fail to operate power|fully
upon the bo&s;om of Peregrine, which was
immediately filled with tho&s;e tumults which love,
ill &s;tifled, frequently excites. He ob&s;erved, that
his di&s;grace was &s;uch as could not be effectually
concealed; therefore he &s;aw no rea&s;on for de|priving
him&s;elf of Emilia's compa&s;&s;ion, &s;ince he
was for ever excluded from her affection; and
de&s;ired Godfrey to pre&s;ent to his &s;i&s;ter the lowly
re&s;pects of a de&s;pairing lover.</P>
<P>But, notwith&s;tanding his declaration of de&s;pon|dence
on this head, his imagination involuntarily
teemed with more agreeable ideas: the propo&s;al
of Crabtree had taken root in his reflection, and
<PB N="280" REF="286">
he could not help forming plans of pa&s;toral feli|city,
in the arms of the lovely Emilia, remote
from tho&s;e pompous &s;cenes, which he now de|te&s;ted
and de&s;pi&s;ed. He amu&s;ed his fancy with
the pro&s;pect of being able to &s;upport her in a
&s;tate of independency, by means of the &s;lender
annuity which it was in his power to purcha&s;e,
together with the fruits of tho&s;e endeavours,
which would profitably employ his vacant hours;
and fore&s;aw provi&s;ion for his growing family in
the friend&s;hip of the lieutenant, who had already
con&s;tituted him his heir. He even parcelled out
his hours, among the nece&s;&s;ary cares of the world,
the plea&s;ures of dome&s;tic bli&s;s, and the enjoy|ments
of a country life; and &s;pent the night
in ideal parties with his charming bride, &s;ome|times
walking by the &s;edgy bank of &s;ome tran&s;pa|rent
&s;tream, &s;ometimes pruning the luxuriant
vine, and &s;ometimes &s;itting in &s;ocial conver&s;e with
her, in a &s;hady grove of his own planting.</P>
<P>The&s;e, however, were no more than the
&s;hadowy phantoms of imagination, which, he
well knew, would never be realized: not that
he believed &s;uch happine&s;s unattainable by a per|&s;on
in his circum&s;tances; but becau&s;e he would
not &s;toop to propo&s;e a &s;cheme, which might, in
any &s;hape, &s;eem to interfere with the intere&s;t of
Emilia, or &s;ubject him&s;elf to a repul&s;e from that
young lady, who had rejected his addre&s;&s;es in the
zenith of his fortune.</P>
<P>While he diverted him&s;elf with the&s;e agreeable
reveries, an unexpected event intervened, in which
&s;he and her brother were deeply intere&s;ted. The
uncle was tapped for the drop&s;y, and died in a
few days after the operation; having bequeathed,
in his will, five thou&s;and pounds to his nephew,
<PB N="281" REF="287">
and twice that &s;um to his niece, who had always
enjoyed the greate&s;t &s;hare of his favour.</P>
<P>If our adventurer, before this occurrence,
looked upon his love for Emilia as a pa&s;&s;ion which
it was nece&s;&s;ary, at any rate, to conquer or &s;up|pre&s;s;
he now con&s;idered her acce&s;&s;ion of for|tune
as a circum&s;tance which confirmed that ne|ce&s;&s;ity,
and re&s;olved to di&s;courage every thought
on that &s;ubject, which &s;hould tend to the propa|gation
of hope: when one day, in the mid&s;t of a
conver&s;ation calculated for the purpo&s;e, Godfrey
put into his hand a letter directed to Mr. Pickle,
in the hand-writing of Emilia; which the youth
no &s;ooner recognized, than his cheeks were co|vered
with a crim&s;on dye, and he began to
tremble with violent agitation: for he, at once,
gue&s;&s;ed the import of the billet, which he ki&s;&s;ed
with great reverence and devotion, and was not
at all &s;urpri&s;ed when he read the following words.</P>

Pickle, having ki&s;&s;ed the &s;ub&s;cription with great
ardour, fell upon his knees, and lifting up his
eyes, &startq;Thank heaven! (cried he, with an air
of tran&s;port) I have not been mi&s;taken in my
opinion of that generous maid. I believed her
in&s;pired with the mo&s;t dignified and heroic &s;enti|ments,
and now &s;he gives me a convincing proof
of her magnanimity: it is now my bu&s;ine&s;s to
approve my&s;elf worthy of her regard. May
heaven inflict upon me the keene&s;t arrows of its
vengeance, if I do not, at this in&s;tant, contem|plate
the character of Emilia with the mo&s;t per|fect
love and adoration; yet, amiable and in|chanting
as &s;he is, I am, more than ever, deter|mined
to &s;acrifice the intere&s;t of my pa&s;&s;ion to
my glory, tho' my life &s;hould fail in the conte&s;t;
and even to refu&s;e an offer, which, otherwi&s;e,
the whole univer&s;e &s;hould not bribe me to
forego.&endq;</P>
<P>This declaration was not &s;o unexpected as un|welcome
to his friend Gauntlet, who repre&s;ented
that his glory was not at all intere&s;ted in the
affair; becau&s;e he had already vindicated his ge|nero&s;ity,
in repeated proffers to lay his whole
fortune at Emilia's feet, when it was impo&s;&s;ible
that any thing &s;elfi&s;h could enter into the propo|&s;al:
but that, in rejecting her pre&s;ent purpo&s;e,
he would give the world an opportunity to &s;ay
that his pride was capricious, his ob&s;tinacy invin|cible,
and his &s;i&s;ter undeniable rea&s;on to believe,
that either his pa&s;&s;ion for her was di&s;&s;embled, or
the ardour of it con&s;iderably abated.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to the&s;e remon&s;trances, Pickle ob|&s;erved,
that he had long &s;et the world at de|fiance;
and as to the opinion of Emilia, he did
not doubt that &s;he would applaud, in her heart,
<PB N="283" REF="289">
the re&s;olution he had taken, and do ju&s;tice to the
purity of his intention.</P>
<P>It was not an ea&s;y ta&s;k to divert our hero from
his de&s;igns, at any time of life; but, &s;ince his
confinement, his inflexibility was become almo&s;t
in&s;urmountable. The captain, therefore, after
having di&s;charged his con&s;cience, in a&s;&s;uring him
that his &s;i&s;ter's happine&s;s was at &s;take, that his
mother had approved of the &s;tep &s;he had taken,
and that he him&s;elf &s;hould be extremely mortified
at his refu&s;al, forbore to pre&s;s him with further
argument, which &s;erved only to rivet him the
more &s;trongly in his own opinion; and undertook
to deliver this an&s;wer to Emilia's letter.</P>

Emilia, who knew the nicety of our hero's
pride, had fore&s;een the purport of this epi&s;tle,
before it came to her hands: &s;he did not, there|fore,
de&s;pair of &s;ucce&s;s, nor de&s;i&s;t from the pro|&s;ecution
of her plan; which was no other than
that of &s;ecuring her own happine&s;s, in e&s;pou&s;ing
the man upon whom &s;he had fixed her unalter|able
affection. Confident of his honour, and
fully &s;atisfied of the mutual pa&s;&s;ion with which
they were in&s;pired, &s;he gradually decoyed him
into a literary corre&s;pondence, wherein &s;he at|tempted
to refute the arguments on which he
grounded his refu&s;al; and, without doubt, the
young gentleman was not a little plea&s;ed with
the enjoyment of &s;uch delightful commerce, in
the cour&s;e of which he had (more than ever) an
opportunity of admiring the poignancy of her
wit, and the elegance of her under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>The contemplation of &s;uch excellency, while
it &s;trengthened the chains with which &s;he held
him en&s;laved, added emulation to the other mo|tives
that induced him to maintain the di&s;pute;
and much &s;ubtlety of rea&s;oning was expended
upon both &s;ides of this very particular que&s;tion,
without any pro&s;pect of conviction on either
part: 'till, at la&s;t, &s;he began to de&s;pair of making
him a pro&s;elyte to her opinion by dint of argu|ment;
and re&s;olved, for the future, to apply her|&s;elf
chiefly to the irre&s;i&s;tible prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of his
love, which were not at all dimini&s;hed or im|paired
by the e&s;&s;ays of her pen. With this view
&s;he propo&s;ed a conference, pretending that it was
impo&s;&s;ible to convey all her reflections, upon this
&s;ubject, in a &s;eries of &s;hort letters; and Godfrey
undertook to bail him for the day: but, con&s;cious
of her power, he would not tru&s;t him&s;elf in her
<PB N="285" REF="291">
pre&s;ence, tho' his heart throbbed with all the
eagerne&s;s of de&s;ire to &s;ee her fair eyes di&s;robed
of that re&s;entment which they had wore &s;o long,
and to enjoy the ravi&s;hing &s;weets of a fond re|conciliation.</P>
<P>Nature could not have held out again&s;t &s;uch
powerful attacks, had not the pride and caprice
of his di&s;po&s;ition been gratified to the full in the
triumph of his re&s;i&s;tance: he looked upon the
conte&s;t as altogether original, and per&s;evered
with ob&s;tinacy, becau&s;e he thought him&s;elf &s;ure
of favourable terms, whenever he &s;hould be di&s;|po&s;ed
to capitulate. Perhaps he might have over|&s;hot
him&s;elf, in the cour&s;e of his per&s;everance:
a young lady of Emilia's fortune and attractions,
could not fail to find her&s;elf &s;urrounded by temp|tations,
which few women can re&s;i&s;t. She might
have mi&s;interpreted the meaning of &s;ome para|graph,
or taken umbrage at an unguarded ex|pre&s;&s;ion
in one of Peregrine's letters: &s;he might
have been tired out by his ob&s;tinate peculiarity,
or, at the long run, con&s;trued it into madne&s;s,
$light, or indifference; or, rather than wa&s;te her
prime in fruitle&s;s endeavours to &s;ubdue the pride
of an head&s;trong humori&s;t, li&s;ten to the voice of
&s;ome admirer, fraught with qualifications &s;uffi|cient
to engage her e&s;teem and affection. But
all the&s;e po&s;&s;ibilities were providentially prevented
by an accident, attended with more important
con&s;equences than any we have hitherto re|counted.</P>
<P>Early one morning, Pipes was di&s;turbed by
the arrival of a me&s;&s;enger, who had been &s;ent
expre&s;s from the country by Mr. Clover, with a
packet for the lieutenant, and arrived in town
overnight; but as he was obliged to have re|cour&s;e
<PB N="286" REF="292">
to the information of Jack's corre&s;pondent
in the city, touching the place of his abode, be|fore
he demanded entrance at the Fleet, the gate
was &s;hut; nor would the turnkeys admit him,
al$$o' he told them, that he was charged with a
me&s;&s;age of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence; &s;o that he
was fain to tarry' till day-break, when he, at his
earne&s;t &s;olicitation, was allowed to enter.</P>
<P>Hatchway, opening the packet, found a letter
inclo&s;ed for Peregrine, with an earne&s;t reque&s;t,
that he would forward it to the hands of that
young gentleman with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch. Jack,
who could not dive into the meaning of this ex|traordinary
injunction, began to imagine that
Mrs. Clover lay at the point of death, and
wanted to take her la&s;t farewel of her brother;
and this conceit worked &s;o &s;trongly upon his
imagination, that, while he huddled on his
cloaths, and made the be&s;t of his way to the
apartment of our hero, he could not help cur&s;ing,
within him&s;elf, the folly of the hu&s;band in &s;end|ing
&s;uch di&s;agreeable me&s;&s;ages to a man of Pere|grine's
impatient temper, already &s;oured by his
own unea&s;y &s;ituation.</P>
<P>This reflection would have induced him to
&s;uppre&s;s the letter, had not he been afraid to
tamper with the tickli&s;h di&s;po&s;ition of his friend,
to whom, while he delivered it, &startq;As for my
own part, (&s;aid he) mayhap I may have as much
natural affection as another; but, when my &s;pou&s;e
parted, I bore my misfortune like a Briti&s;h man
and a Chri&s;tian: for, why? he's no better than
a fre&s;h-water &s;ailor, who knows not how to &s;tem
the current of mi&s;chance.&endq;</P>
<P>Pickle being waked from a plea&s;ant dream,
in which the fair Emilia was principally con|cerned,
<PB N="287" REF="293">
and, hearing this &s;trange preamble, &s;at
up in his bed, and un&s;ealed the letter, in a &s;tate
of mortification and di&s;gu&s;t: but what were the
emotions of his &s;oul, when he read the following
intimation!</P>
<LETTER>

</LETTER>
<P>Peregrine, at fir&s;t, looked upon this epi&s;tle as
a meer illu&s;ion of the brain, and a continuation
of the reverie in which he had been engaged. He
read it ten times over, without being per&s;uaded
that he was actually awake: he rubbed his eyes,
and &s;hook his head, in order to &s;hake off the
drow&s;y vapours that &s;urrounded him: he hemm'd
thrice with great vo$iferation, &s;napp'd his fingers,
<PB N="288" REF="294">
tweak'd his no&s;e, &s;tarted up from his bed, and,
opening the ca&s;ement, took a &s;urvey of the well-known
objects that appeared on each &s;ide of his
habitation. Every thing &s;eemed congr'ous and
connected, and he &s;aid, within him&s;elf, &startq;Sure
this is the mo&s;t di&s;tinct dream that ever &s;leep
produced. Then he had recour&s;e again to the
paper, which he carefully peru&s;ed, without find|ing
any variation from his fir&s;t notion of the
contents.</P>
<P>Hatchway, &s;eeing all this extravagance of ac|tion,
accompanied with a wild &s;tare of di&s;trac|tion,
began to believe that his head was at length
fairly turned, and was really meditating means
for &s;ecuring his per&s;on; when Pickle, in a tone
of &s;urprize, exclaimed, &startq;Good God! am I,
or am I not awake?&endq; &startq;Why, look ye, cou&s;in
Pickle, (replied the lieutenant) that is a que&s;tion
which the deep &s;ea-line of my under&s;tanding is
not long enough to &s;ound: but, how&s;omever,
tho'$ I can't tru&s;t to the ob&s;ervation I have taken,
it &s;hall go hard but I will fall upon a way to gue&s;s
whereabouts we are.&endq; So &s;aying, he lifted up a
pitcher full of cold water, that &s;tood behind the
outward door, and di&s;charged it in the face of
Peregrine, without ceremony or he&s;itation.</P>
<P>This remedy produced the de&s;ired effect: un|palatable
as it was, the young gentleman no
&s;ooner recovered his breath, which was endan|gered
by &s;uch a &s;udden application, than he thank'd
his friend Jack for the &s;ea&s;onable operation he had
performed; and having no longer any ju&s;t rea&s;on
to doubt the reality of what appealed &s;o con|vincingly
to his &s;en&s;es, he &s;hifted him&s;elf on the
in&s;tant, not without hurry and trepidation; and
putting on his morning-dre&s;s, $allied forth to the
<PB N="289" REF="295">
bear, in order to deliberate with him&s;elf on the
important intelligence he had received.</P>
<P>Hatchway, not yet fully convinced of his &s;anity,
and curious to know the purport of the letter,
which had affected him in &s;uch an extraordinary
manner, carefully attended his foot&s;teps in this
excur&s;ion, in hope of being favoured with his
confidence, in the cour&s;e of their perambulation.
Our hero no &s;ooner appeared at the &s;treet-door,
than he was &s;aluted by the me&s;&s;enger, who
having po&s;ted him&s;elf in the way for that pur|po&s;e,
&startq;God ble&s;s your noble honour, &s;quire
Pickle, (cried he) and give you joy of &s;ucceed|ing
to your father's e&s;tate.&endq; The&s;e words had
&s;carce proceeded from his mouth, when the lieu|tenant
hopping eagerly towards the countryman,
&s;queezed his hand with great affection, and a&s;ked
if the old gentleman had actually taken his de|parture:
&startq;Ay, ma&s;ter Hatchway, (replied the
other) in &s;uch a woundy ha&s;te, that he forgot to
make a will.&endq; &startq;Body of me! (exclaimed the
&s;eaman) the&s;e are the be&s;t tidings I have heard
&s;ince I fir&s;t went to &s;ea. Here, my lad, take my
pur&s;e, and &s;tow thy&s;elf chocque-full of the be&s;t
liquor in the land.&endq; So &s;aying, he tipped the
pea&s;ant with ten pieces, and immediately the
whole place ecchoed with the &s;ound of Tom's
in&s;trument; while Peregrine, repairing to the
walk, communicated the billet to his hone&s;t
friend, who, at his de&s;ire, went forthwith to the
lodgings of captain Gauntlet, and returned in
le&s;s than half an hour with that gentleman, who
(I need not &s;ay) was heartily rejoiced at the oc|ca&s;ion.</P>

reque&s;ting his immediate pre&s;ence; and he
accordingly appeared, in obedience to the &s;um|mons,
growling with di&s;content, for having been
deprived of &s;everal hours of his natural re&s;t. His
mouth was immediately &s;topped with the letter, at
which he <HI>&s;miled horrible a gha&s;tly grin;</HI> and, after
a compliment of congratulation, they entered in|to
clo&s;e divan, about the mea&s;ures to be taken in
con&s;equence of this event.</P>
<P>There was no room for much debate: it was
unanimou&s;ly agreed, that Pickle &s;hould &s;et out,
with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch, for the gari&s;on, to
which Gauntlet and Hatchway re&s;olved to at|tend
him; and Pipes was accordingly ordered to
prepare a couple of po&s;t-chai&s;es, while Godfrey
went to procure bail for his friend, and provide
them with money for the expence of the expedi|tion,
but not before he was de&s;ired by Peregrine
to conceal this piece of news from his &s;i&s;ter, that
our youth might have an opportunity to &s;urpri&s;e
her in a more intere&s;ting manner, after he
&s;hould have &s;ettled his affairs.</P>
<P>All the&s;e previous &s;teps being taken in le&s;s than
an hour, our hero took his leave of the Fleet,
after he had left twenty guineas with the warden
<PB N="291" REF="297">
for the relief of the poor pri&s;oners, a great num|ber
of whom conveyed him to the gate, pouring
forth prayers for his long life and pro&s;perity; and
he took the road to the gari&s;on, in the mo&s;t ele|vated
tran&s;ports of joy, unallayed with the lea&s;t
mixture of grief at the death of a parent who&s;e
paternal tenderne&s;s he had never known; &s;o that
his brea&s;t was ab&s;olutely a &s;tranger to that boa&s;t|ed
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, or in&s;tinct of affection, by which the
charities are &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;ub&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>Of all the journeys he had ever made, this,
&s;ure, was the mo&s;t delightful: he felt all the ex|ta&s;y
that mu&s;t naturally be produced in a young
man of his imagination, from &s;uch a &s;udden tran|&s;ition,
in point of circum&s;tance; he found him|&s;elf
delivered from confinement and di&s;grace,
without being obliged to any per&s;on upon earth
for his deliverance; he had it now in his power
to retort the contempt of the world, in a man|ner
&s;uited to his mo&s;t &s;anguine wi&s;h; he was re|conciled
to his friend, and enabled to gratify his
love, even upon his own terms; and &s;aw him&s;elf
in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a fortune more ample than his fir&s;t
inheritance, with a &s;tock of experience that
would &s;teer him clear of all tho&s;e quick&s;ands
among which he had been formerly wrecked.</P>
<P>In the middle of their journey, while they
halted at an inn for a &s;hort refre&s;hment and
change of hor&s;es, a po&s;tilion ran up to Peregrine
in the yard, and falling at his feet, cla&s;ped his
knees with great eagerne&s;s and agitation, and pre|&s;ented
to him the individual face of his old valet
de chambre. The youth perceiving him in &s;uch
an abject garb and attitude, commanded him to
ri&s;e, and tell the cau&s;e of &s;uch a mi&s;erable rever&s;e
in his fortune. Upon which H$dgi gave him to
<PB N="292" REF="298">
under&s;tand, that he had been ruined by his wife,
who having robbed him of all his ca&s;h and valu|able
effects, had eloped from his hou&s;e, with
one of his own cu&s;tomers, who appeared in the
character of a French count, but was in reality
no other than an Italian fidler; that, in con&s;e|quence
of this retreat, he (the hu&s;band) was di&s;|abled
from paying a con&s;iderable &s;um which he
had &s;et apart for his wine-merchant, who being
di&s;appointed in his expectation, took out an ex|tent
again&s;t his effects; and the re&s;t of his cre|ditors
following his example, hunted him out of
hou&s;e and home: &s;o that, finding his per&s;on in
danger at London, he had been obliged to e&s;cape
into the country, &s;kulking about from one vil|lage
to another, till being quite de&s;titute of all
&s;upport, he had undertaken his pre&s;ent office, to
&s;ave him&s;elf from &s;tarving.</P>
<P>Peregrine li&s;tened with compa&s;&s;ion to his la|mentable
tale, which too well accounted for his
not appearing in the Fleet, with offers of &s;ervice
to his ma&s;ter in di&s;tre&s;s, a circum&s;tance that
Pickle had all along imputed to his avarice and
ingratitude; and he a&s;&s;ured him, that as he had
been the means of throwing in his way the temp|tation
to which he fell a &s;acrifice, he would charge
him&s;elf with the retrieval of his affairs: in the
mean time, he made him ta&s;te of his bounty, and
de&s;ired him to continue in his pre&s;ent employ|ment,
until he &s;hould return from the gari&s;on,
when he would con&s;ider his &s;ituation, and do
&s;omething for his immediate relief.</P>
<P>Hadgi attempted to ki&s;s his &s;hoe, and wept, or
affected to weep, with &s;en&s;ibility, at this gracious
reception; he even made a merit of his unwil|lingne&s;s
to exerci&s;e his new occupation, and ear|ne&s;tly
<PB N="293" REF="299">
begged that he might be allowed to give
immediate attendance upon his dear ma&s;ter, from
whom he could not bear the thoughts of a &s;econd
parting. His intreaties were reinforced by the
interce&s;&s;ion of his two friends, in con&s;equence of
which the Swi&s;s was permitted to follow them at
his own lei&s;ure, while they &s;et forwards, after a
&s;light repa&s;t, and reached the place of their de|&s;tination
before ten o' clock at night.</P>
<P>Peregrine, in&s;tead of alighting at the gari&s;on,
rode &s;traightway to his father's hou&s;e; and no
per&s;on appearing to receive him, not even a &s;er|vant
to take care of his chai$e, he di&s;mounted
without a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and being followed by his
two friends, advanced into the hall, where per|ceiving
a bell-rope, he made immediate applica|tion
to it, in &s;uch a manner as brought a couple
of footmen into his pre&s;ence. After having repri|manded
them, with a &s;tern look, for their ne|glect,
in point of attendance, he commanded
them to &s;hew him into an apartment; and, as
they &s;eemed unwilling to yield obedience to his
orders, a&s;ked if they did not belong to the fa|mily?</P>
<P>One of them, who took upon him&s;elf the of|fice
of &s;poke&s;man, replied with a &s;ullen air, that
they had been in the &s;ervice of old Mr. Pickle,
and now that he was dead, thought them&s;elves
bound to obey no body but their lady, and her &s;on
Mr. Gamaliel. This declaration had &s;carce pro|ceeded
from his mouth, when our hero gave them
to under&s;tand, that &s;ince they were not di&s;po&s;ed
to own any other ma&s;ter, they mu&s;t change their
quarters immediately; and ordered them to de|camp
without further preparation: and as they
&s;till continued re&s;tiff, they were kicked out of
<PB N="294" REF="300">
doors by the captain and his friend Hatchway.
Squire Gam, who overheard every thing that
pa&s;&s;ed, and was now more than ever inflamed
with that rancour which he had &s;ucked with his
mother's milk, flew to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his ad|herents,
with a pi&s;tol in each hand, bellowing
<HI>Thieves! thieves!</HI> with great vociferation, as if
he had mi&s;taken the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;trangers, and
actually believed him&s;elf in danger of being
robbed. Under this pretence he di&s;charged a
piece at his brother, who luckily e&s;caping the
&s;hot, clo&s;ed with him in a moment, and wre&s;t|ing
the other pi&s;tol from his gripe, turned him
out into the court-yard, to the con&s;olation of his
two dependants.</P>
<P>By this time, Pipes and the two po&s;tilions had
taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;tables, without being op|po&s;ed
by the coachman and his deputy, who
quietly &s;ubmitted to the authority of their new
&s;overeign; but the noi&s;e of the pi&s;tol had alarm|ed
Mrs. Pickle, who running down &s;tairs, with
the mo&s;t frantic appearance, attended by two
maids and the curate, who &s;till maintained his
place of chaplain and gho&s;tly director in the fa|mily,
would have a&s;&s;aulted our hero with her
nails, had not &s;he been re&s;trained by her attend|ants,
who, tho' they prevented her from u&s;ing
her hands, could not hinder her from exerci&s;ing
her tongue, which &s;he wagged again&s;t him with
all the virulence of malice. She a&s;k'd, if he
was come to butcher his brother, to in&s;ult his fa|ther's
corp&s;e, and triumph in her affliction; &s;he
be&s;towed upon him the epithets of &s;pendthrift,
jailbird, and unnatural ruffian; &s;he begg'd par|don
of God for having brought &s;uch a mon&s;ter
into the world, accu&s;ed him of having brought
<PB N="295" REF="301">
his father's grey hairs with &s;orrow to the grave;
and affirmed, that were he to touch the body, it
would bleed at his approach.</P>
<P>Without pretending to refute the articles of
this ridiculous charge, he allowed her to ring out
her alarm; and then calmly replied, that if &s;he
did not quietly retire to her chamber, and behave
as became a per&s;on in her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, he
&s;hould in&s;i&s;t upon her removing to another lodg|ing,
without delay; for he was determined to be
ma&s;ter in his own family. The lady, who, in
all probability, expected that he would endea|vour
to appea&s;e her with all the tenderne&s;s of filial
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, was &s;o much exa&s;perated at his ca|valier
behaviour, that her con&s;titution could not
&s;upport the tran&s;ports of her &s;pirits; and &s;he was
carried off by her women, in a fit, while the
officious clergyman was di&s;mi&s;s'd after his pupil,
with all the circum&s;tances of di&s;grace.</P>
<P>Our hero having thus made his quarters good,
took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the be&s;t apartment in the hou&s;e,
and &s;ent notice of his arrival to Mr. Clover, who,
with his wife, vi&s;ited him in le&s;s than an hour,
and was not a little &s;urpri&s;ed to find him &s;o &s;ud|denly
&s;ettled in his father's hou&s;e. The meeting
of Julia and her brother was extremely pathetic.
She had always loved him with uncommon
tenderne&s;s, and looked upon him as the orna|ment
of her family; but &s;he had heard of his ex|travagancies
with regret, and tho' &s;he con&s;idered
the &s;tories that were circulated at his expence, as
the malicious exaggerations of his mother and her
darling &s;on, her apprehen&s;ion had been grievou&s;ly
alarmed by an account of his impri&s;onment and
di&s;tre&s;s, which had been accidentally conveyed
to that country by a gentleman from London,
<PB N="296" REF="302">
who had been formerly of his acquaintance: &s;he
could not, therefore, without the mo&s;t tender
emotions of joy, &s;ee him, as it were, re&s;tored to his
rightful inheritance, and re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in that
&s;tation of life which &s;he thought he could fill with
dignity and importance.</P>
<P>After their mutual expre&s;&s;ions of affection, &s;he
retired to her mother's chamber, with a view to
make a &s;econd offer of her &s;ervice and attend|ance,
which had been already rejected with &s;corn
&s;ince her father's death; while Peregrine con|&s;ulted
his brother-in-law, about the affairs of the
family, &s;o far as they had fallen within his cog|nizance
and ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Mr. Clover told him, that though he was
never favoured with the confidence of the de|funct,
he knew &s;ome of his intimates, who had
been tampered with by Mrs. Pickle, and even
engaged to &s;econd the remon&s;trances by which
&s;he had often endeavoured to per&s;uade her hu&s;|band
to &s;ettle his affairs by a formal will; but
that he had from time to time evaded their im|portunities
with &s;urpri&s;ing excu&s;es of procra&s;tina|tion,
that plainly appeared to be the re&s;ult of in|vention
and de&s;ign, far above the &s;uppo&s;ed pitch
of his capacity; a circum&s;tance from which Mr.
Clover concluded, that the old gentleman ima|gined
his life would not have been &s;ecure, had
he once taken &s;uch a &s;tep as mu&s;t have rendered it
unnece&s;&s;ary to the independence of his &s;econd &s;on.
He moreover ob&s;erved, that, in con&s;equence of
this information, he no &s;ooner heard of Mr.
Pickle's death, which happened at the club, than
he went directly, with a lawyer, to his hou&s;e,
before any cab$l or con&s;piracy could be formed
again&s;t the rightful heir; and, in pre&s;ence of
<PB N="297" REF="303">
witne&s;&s;es provided for the purpo&s;e, &s;ealed up all
the papers of the decea&s;ed, after the widow had,
in the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of her &s;orrow and vexation,
fairly owned, that her husband had died in|te&s;tate.</P>
<P>Pereg$ine was extremely well &s;atisfied with
this intelligence, by which all his doubts were
di&s;pelled, and having chearfully &s;upped with his
friends on a cold collation which his brother-in-law
had brought in his chariot, they retired to
re&s;t, in different chambers, after Julia had met
with another repul&s;e from her capricious mother,
who&s;e overflowing rage had now &s;ub&s;ided into the
former channel of calm inveteracy.</P>
<P>Next morning the hou&s;e was &s;upplied with
&s;ome &s;ervants from the gari&s;on, and preparations
made for the funeral of the decea&s;ed; and Gam
having taken lodgings in the neighbourhood,
came with a chai&s;e and cart to demand his mo|ther,
together with his own cloaths, and her per|&s;onal
effects.</P>
<P>Our hero, tho' he would not &s;uffer him to en|ter
the door, allowed his propo&s;al to be commu|nicated
to the widow, who eagerly embraced the
opportunity of removing, and was, with her own
baggage, and that of her beloved &s;on, conveyed
to the place which he had prepared for her re|ception;
whither &s;he was followed by her wo|man,
who was de&s;ired by Peregrine to a&s;&s;ure her
mi&s;tre&s;s, that, until a regular provi&s;ion could be
&s;ettled upon her, &s;he might command him, in
point of money, or any other accommodation in
his power.</P>

<P>SUITS of mourning being provided for him|&s;elf,
his friends and adherents, and every
other previous mea&s;ure taken, &s;uitable to the oc|ca&s;ion,
his father was interred, in a private man|ner,
in the pari&s;h-church; and his papers being
examined, in pre&s;ence of many per&s;ons of ho|nour

will was found, or any other deed, in favour of
the &s;econd &s;on, tho' it appeared by the marriage
&s;ettlement, that the widow was intitled to a join|ture
of five hundred pounds a year. The re&s;t
of his papers con&s;i&s;ted of Ea&s;t-India bonds,
South-&s;ea annuities, mortgages, notes and a&s;|&s;ignments,
to the amount of four&s;core thou&s;and
&s;even hundred and &s;ixty pounds, exclu&s;ive of the
hou&s;e, plate and furniture, hor&s;es, equipage and
cattle, with the garden and park adjacent, to a
very con&s;iderable extent.</P>
<P>This was a &s;um that even exceeded his ex|pectation,
and could not fail to entertain his
fancy with the mo&s;t agreeable ideas. He found
him&s;elf immediately a man of va&s;t con&s;equence
among his country neighbours, who vi&s;ited him
with compliments of congratulation, and treated
him with &s;uch re&s;pect as would have effectually
&s;poiled any young man of his di&s;po&s;ition, who
had not the &s;ame advantages of experience as he
had already purcha&s;ed at a very extravagant
price. Thus &s;hielded with caution, he bore his
pro&s;perity with &s;urpri&s;ing temperance; every
<PB N="299" REF="305">
body was charmed with his affability and mode|ration;
and when he made a circuit round the
gentlemen of the di&s;trict, in order to repay the
courte&s;y which he owed, he was care&s;&s;ed by
them with uncommon a&s;&s;iduity, and advi&s;ed to
offer him&s;elf as a candidate for the county, at the
next election, which, they &s;uppo&s;ed, would &s;oon
happen, becau&s;e the pre&s;ent member was in a
declining &s;tate of health. Nor did his per&s;on
and addre&s;s e&s;cape unheeded by the ladies, many
of whom did not &s;cruple to &s;pread their attrac|tions
before him, with a view of captivating &s;uch
a valuable prize: nay, &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion did
this legacy make upon a certain peer, who re|&s;ided
in this part of the country, that he culti|vated
Pickle's acquaintance with great eagerne&s;s,
and, without circumlocution, offered to him in
marriage his only daughter, with a very con|&s;iderable
fortune.</P>
<P>Our hero expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, upon this occa|&s;ion,
as became a man of honour, &s;en&s;ibility and
politene&s;s; and frankly gave his lord&s;hip to un|der&s;tand,
that his heart was already engaged.
He was plea&s;ed with the opportunity of making
&s;uch a &s;acrifice to his pa&s;&s;ion for Emilia, which,
by this time, inflamed his thoughts to &s;uch a de|gree
of impatience, that he re&s;olved to depart for
London, with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed; and for that
purpo&s;e indu&s;triou&s;ly employed almo&s;t every hour
of his time in regulating his dome&s;tic affairs. He
paid off all his father's &s;ervants, and hired others,
at the recommendation of his &s;i&s;ter, who pro|mi&s;ed
to &s;uperintend his hou&s;hold in his ab&s;ence:
he advanced the fir&s;t half-yearly payment of his
mother's jointure; and as for his brother Gam,
he gave him divers opportunities of acknowledg|ing
<PB N="300" REF="306">
his faults, &s;o as that he might have an&s;wered
to his own con&s;cience for taking any &s;tep in his
favour; but that young gentleman was not yet
&s;ufficiently humbled by misfortune, and not only
forbore to make any overtures of peace, but al&s;o
took all occa&s;ions to &s;lander the conduct and re|vile
the per&s;on of our hero, being, in this prac|tice,
comforted and abetted by his righteous
mamma.</P>
<P>Every thing being thus &s;ettled for the pre&s;ent,
the triumvirate &s;et out on their return to town, in
the fame manner with that in which they had ar|rived
in the country, except in this &s;mall varia|tion,
that Hatchway's chai&s;e-companion was
now the valet de chambre refitted, in&s;tead of
Pipes, who, with another lacquey, attended
them on hor&s;eback. When they had performed
two thirds of their way to London, they chanced
to overtake a country &s;quire, on his return from
a vi&s;it to one of his neighbours, who had enter|tained
him with &s;uch ho&s;pitality, that (as the lieu|tenant
ob&s;erved) he rolled him&s;elf almo&s;t gun|wale
to, at every motion of his hor&s;e, which
was a fine hunter; and when the chai&s;es pa&s;s'd
him at full &s;peed, he &s;et up the &s;port&s;man's hol|low,
in a voice that founded like a French horn,
clapping &s;purs to Sorrel at the &s;ame time, in order
to keep up with the pace of the machine.</P>
<P>Peregrine, who was animated with an uncom|mon
flow of &s;pirits, ordered his po&s;tilion to pro|ceed
more &s;oftly; and entered into conver&s;ation
with the &s;tranger, touching the make and mettle
of his hor&s;e, upon which he de&s;canted with &s;o
much learning, that the &s;quire was a&s;toni&s;hed at
his knowledge, and &s;o engaged with his manner
of di&s;cour&s;e, that, when they approached his
<PB N="301" REF="307">
habitation, he invited the young gentleman and
his company to halt, and drink a bottle of his
ale; and was &s;o pre&s;&s;ing in his &s;olicitation, that
they complied with his reque&s;t. He accordingly
conducted them through a &s;pacious avenue, that
extended as far as the highway, to the gate of a
large <HI>chateau,</HI> of a mo&s;t noble and venerable ap|pearance,
which induced them to alight and
view the apartments, contrary to their fir&s;t inten|tion
of drinking a gla&s;s of his October at the
door.</P>
<P>The rooms were every way &s;uitable to the
magnificence of the out&s;ide, and our hero ima|gined
they had made a tour through the whole
&s;weep, when the landlord gave him to under|&s;tand
that they had not yet &s;een the be&s;t apart|ment
of the hou&s;e, and immediately led them
into a &s;pacious dining-room, which Peregrine
did not enter without giving manife&s;t &s;igns of un|common
a&s;toni&s;hment. The pannels all round
were covered with portraits, at full length, by
Vandyke; and not one of them appeared with|out
a ridiculous tye-perriwig, in the &s;tyle of tho&s;e
that u&s;ually hang over the &s;hops of two-penny
barbers. The &s;trait boots in which the figures
had been originally painted, and the other cir|cum&s;tances
of attitude and drapery, &s;o incon|&s;i&s;tent
with this mon&s;trous furniture of the head,
exhibited &s;uch a ludicrous appearance, that Pickle's
wonder, in a little time, gave way to his mirth,
and he was &s;eized with a violent fit of laughter,
which had well nigh deprived him of his breath.</P>
<P>The &s;quire, half plea&s;ed and half offended at
this expre&s;&s;ion of ridicule, &startq;I know (&s;aid he)
what makes you laugh &s;o woefully: you think it
&s;trange to zee my yorefathers booted and &s;purred,
<PB N="302" REF="308">
with huge three tailed perriwigs on their pates.
The truth of the matter is this: I could not
abide to zee the pictures of my vamily, with a
parcel of loo&s;e hair hanging about their eyes,
like zo many colts; and zo I employed a painter
vellow from Lundon to clap decent perriwigs
upon their &s;kulls, at the rate of vive &s;hillings a
head, and offered him three &s;hillings a-piece to
furni&s;h each with an handzome pair of &s;hoes and
&s;tockings: but the ra&s;cal, thinking I mu&s;t have
'em done at any price, after their heads were
covered, haggled with me for your &s;hillings a
picture; and zo, rather than be impo&s;ed upon,
I turned him off, and &s;hall let 'em &s;tand as they
are, 'till zome more rea&s;onable brother of the
bru&s;h comes round the country.&endq;</P>
<P>Pickle commended his re&s;olution, tho', in his
heart, he ble&s;&s;ed him&s;elf from &s;uch a barbarous
Goth; and, after they had di&s;patched two or
three bottles of his beer, they proceeded on their
journey, and arrived in town about eleven at
night.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">He enjoys an interview with Emilia, and makes
him&s;elf ample amends for all the mortifications
of his life.</HEAD>
<P>GODFREY, who had taken leave of his
&s;i&s;ter, on pretence of making a &s;hort ex|cur&s;ion
with Peregrine, who&s;e health required the
enjoyment of fre&s;h air, after his long confine|ment,
&s;ent a me&s;&s;age to her, that &s;ame night,
announcing his arrival, and giving her notice
that he would breakfa&s;t with her next morning;
<PB N="303" REF="309">
when he and our hero, who had dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf
for the purpo&s;e, taking a hackney-coach, repaired
to her lodging, and were introduced into a par|lour,
adjoining to that in which the tea-table was
&s;et. Here they had not waited many minutes
when they heard the &s;ound of feet, coming down
&s;tairs; upon which our hero's heart began to
beat the alarm, and he concealed him&s;elf behind
the &s;creen, by the direction of his friend, who&s;e
ears being &s;aluted with Sophy's voice from the
next room, he flew into it with great ardour,
and enjoyed upon her lips the &s;weet tran&s;ports of
a meeting &s;o unexpected; for he had left her in
her father's hou&s;e at Wind&s;or.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the&s;e emotions, he had almo&s;t forgot
the &s;ituation of Peregrine; when Emilia, a&s;|&s;uming
an enchanting air, &startq;Is not this (&s;aid
&s;he) a mo&s;t provoking &s;cene to a young woman
like me, who am doomed to wear the willow,
by the &s;trange caprice of my lover? Upon my
word, brother, you have done me infinite pre|judice,
in promoting this jaunt with my ob&s;ti|nate
corre&s;pondent; who, I &s;uppo&s;e, is &s;o ra|vi&s;hed
with this tran&s;ient glimp&s;e of liberty, that
he will never be per&s;uaded to incur unnece&s;&s;ary
confinement for the future.&endq; &startq;My dear &s;i&s;ter,
(replied the captain, tauntingly) your own pride
&s;et him the example; &s;o you mu&s;t e'en &s;tand to
the con&s;equence of his imitation.&endq; &startq;'Tis a
hard ca&s;e, however, (an&s;wered the fair offender)
that I &s;hould &s;uffer all my life, by one venial
tre&s;pa&s;s. Heigh ho! who would imagine that a
&s;prightly girl, &s;uch as I, with ten thou&s;and pounds,
&s;hould go a begging? I have a good mind to
marry the next per&s;on that a&s;ks me the que&s;tion,
in order to be revenged upon this unyielding
<PB N="304" REF="310">
humouri&s;t. Did the dear fellow di&s;cover no in|clination
to &s;ee me, in all the term of his relea&s;e|ment?
Well, if ever I can catch the fugitive
again, he &s;hall &s;ing in his cage for life.&endq;</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to convey to the reader a ju&s;t
idea of Peregrine's tran&s;ports, while he over|heard
this declaration; which was no &s;ooner pro|nounced,
than, unable to re&s;i&s;t the impetuo&s;ity
of his pa&s;&s;ion, he &s;prung from his lurking place,
exclaiming, &startq;Here I &s;urrender;&endq; and ru&s;hing
into her pre&s;ence, was &s;o dazzled with her beau|ty,
that his &s;peech failed: he was fixed, like a
&s;tatue, to the floor; and all his faculties were
ab&s;orpt in admiration. Indeed, &s;he was now in
the full bloom of her charms, and it was nearly
impo&s;&s;ible to look upon her without emotion.
What then mu&s;t have been the exta&s;y of our
youth, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ion was whetted with all the
incitements which could &s;timulate the human
heart! The ladies &s;creamed with &s;urprize at his
appearance, and Emilia underwent &s;uch agitation
as flu&s;hed every charm with irre&s;i&s;tible energy:
her cheeks glowed with a mo&s;t delicate &s;uffu&s;ion,
and her bo&s;om heaved with &s;uch bewitching un|dulation,
that the cambrick could not conceal
or contain the &s;nowy hemi&s;pheres, that ro&s;e like
a vi&s;ion of paradi&s;e to his view.</P>
<P>While he was almo&s;t fainting with unutterable
delight, &s;he &s;eemed ready to &s;ink under the tu|mults
of tenderne&s;s and confu&s;ion; when our
hero, perceiving her condition, obeyed the im|pul&s;e
of his love, and circled the charmer in his
arms, without &s;uffering the lea&s;t frown or &s;ymp|tom
of di&s;plea&s;ure. Not all the plea&s;ures of his
life, had amounted to the ineffable joy of this
embrace, in which he continued for &s;ome mi|nutes
<PB N="305" REF="311">
totally entranced. He fa&s;tened upon her
pouting lips, with all the eagerne&s;s of rapture;
and, while his brain &s;eemed to whirl round with
tran&s;port, exclaimed in a delirium of bli&s;s,
&startq;Heaven and earth! this is too much to bear!&endq;</P>
<P>His imagination was accordingly relieved, and
his attention in &s;ome mea&s;ure divided, by the in|terpo&s;ition
of Sophy, who kindly chid him for
his having overlooked his old friends: thus ac|co&s;ted,
he quitted his delicious armful, and, &s;a|luting
Mrs. Gauntlet, a&s;ked pardon for his ne|glect;
ob&s;erving, that &s;uch rudene&s;s was excu&s;e|able,
con&s;idering the long and unhappy exile
which he had &s;uffered, from the jewel of his
&s;oul. Then turning to Emilia, &startq;I am come,
madam, (&s;aid he) to claim the performance of
your promi&s;e, which I can produce under your
own fair hand: you may, therefore, lay a&s;ide all
&s;uperfluous ceremony and &s;hyne&s;s, and crown
my happine&s;s without farther delay; for, upon
my &s;oul! my thoughts are wound up to the la&s;t
pitch of expectation, and I &s;hall certainly run
di&s;tracted, if I am doomed to any term of pro|bation.&endq;</P>
<P>His mi&s;tre&s;s, having by this time recollected
her&s;elf, replied with a mo&s;t exhilerating &s;mile,
&startq;I ought to puni&s;h you, for your ob&s;tinacy, with
the mortification of a twelve-month's trial; but
'tis dangerous to tamper with an admirer of your
di&s;po&s;ition, and therefore, I think&punc; I mu&s;t make
&s;ure of you while it is in my power.&endq; &startq;You
are willing, then, to take me for better for wor&s;e,
in pre&s;ence of heaven and the&s;e witne&s;&s;es?&endq; cried
Peregrine, kneeling, and applying her hand to
his lips. At this interrogation, her features
&s;oftened into an amazing expre&s;&s;ion of conde|&s;cending
<PB N="306" REF="312">
love; and while &s;he darted a &s;ide-glance,
that thrilled to his marrow, and heaved a &s;igh
more &s;oft than zephyr's balmy wing, her an&s;wer
was, &startq;Why&mdash;ay&mdash;and heaven grant me pa|tience
to bear the humours of &s;uch a yoke-fellow.&endq;
&startq;And may the &s;ame powers (replied
the youth) grant me life and opportunity to ma|nife&s;t
the immen&s;ity of my love. Mean while,
I have eighty thou&s;and pounds, which &s;hall be laid
immediately in your lap.&endq;</P>
<P>So &s;aying, he &s;ealed the contract upon her lips,
and explained the my&s;tery of his la&s;t words,
which had begun to operate upon the wonder
of the two &s;i&s;ters. Sophy was agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed
with the account of his good fortune: nor was
it, in all probability, unacceptable to the lovely
Emilia; tho', from this information, &s;he took an
opportunity to upbraid her admirer with the in|flexibility
of his pride, which (&s;he &s;crupled not
to &s;ay) would have baffled all the &s;ugge&s;tions of
his pa&s;&s;ion, had not it been gratified by this pro|vidential
event.</P>
<P>Matters being thus happily matured, the lover
begged that immediate recour&s;e might be had to
the church, and his happine&s;s a&s;certained before
night. But the bride objected, with great vehe|mence,
to &s;uch precipitation, being de&s;irous of
her mother's pre&s;ence at the ceremony; and &s;he
was &s;econded in her opinion by her brother's
wife: upon which Peregrine, maddening with
de&s;ire, a&s;&s;aulted her with the mo&s;t earne&s;t in|treaties,
repre&s;enting, that, as her mother's con|&s;ent
was already obtained, there was &s;urely no
nece&s;&s;ity for a delay, that mu&s;t infallibly make
a dangerous impre&s;&s;ion upon his brain and con|&s;titution.
He fell at her feet, in all the agony of
<PB N="307" REF="313">
impatience; &s;wore that his life and intellects
would actually be in jeopardy by her refu&s;al; and
when &s;he attempted to argue him out of his de|mand,
began to rave with &s;uch extravagance,
that Sophy was frightened into conviction: and
Godfrey enforcing the remon&s;trances of his friend,
the amiable Emilia was teized into compliance.</P>
<P>After breakfa&s;t the bridegroom and his com|panion
&s;et out for the Commons for a l$cence,
having fir&s;t agreed upon the hou&s;e at which the
ceremony &s;hould be performed, in the lodgings
of the bride: and the permi&s;&s;ion being obtained,
they found means to engage a clergyman, who
undertook to attend them at their own time and
place. Then a ring was purcha&s;ed for the occa|&s;ion;
and they went in &s;earch of the lieutenant,
with whom they dined at a tavern, and not only
made him acquainted with the &s;teps they had
taken, but de&s;ired that he would &s;tand god-father
to the bride: an employment which Jack accepted
with demon&s;trations of particular &s;atisfaction;
'till chancing to look into the &s;treet, and &s;eeing
Cadwallader approach the door, in con&s;equence
of a me&s;&s;age they had &s;ent to him by Pipes, he
declined the office in favour of the &s;enior; who
was accordingly ordained for that purpo&s;e, on the
&s;uppo&s;ition that &s;uch a mark of regard might faci|litate
his concurrence with a match, which,
otherwi&s;e, he would certainly oppo&s;e, as he was
a profe&s;&s;ed enemy to wedlock, and, as yet, igno|rant
of Peregrine's intention.</P>
<P>After having congratulated Pickle upon his
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and &s;hook his two friends by the
hand, the mi&s;anthrope a&s;ked who&s;e mare was
dead, that he was &s;ummoned in &s;uch a plaguy
hurry from his dinner, which he had been fain
<PB N="308" REF="314">
to gobble up like a cannibal. Our hero gave him
to under&s;tand, that they had made an appointment
to drink tea with two agreeable ladies, and were
unwilling that he &s;hould lo&s;e the opportunity of
enjoying an entertainment which he loved &s;o
much. Crabtree, &s;hrivelling up his face, like an
autumn leaf, at this intimation, cur&s;ed his com|plai&s;ance,
and &s;wore they &s;hould keep their a&s;&s;ig|nation
without him; for he and letchery had
&s;hook hands many years ago.</P>
<P>The bridegroom, however, likening him unto
an old co$chman, who &s;till delights in the &s;mack
of the whip, and dropping &s;ome flattering hints
of his manhood, even at the&s;e years, he was gra|dually
prevailed upon to accompany them to the
place of rendezvous; where, being u&s;hered into
a dining-room, they had not waited three mi|nutes
when they were joined by the par&s;on, who
had ob&s;erved the hour with great punctuality.</P>
<P>This gentleman no &s;ooner entered the room,
than Cadwallader, in a whi&s;per to Gauntlet,
a&s;ked if that was not the cock-bawd; and be|fore
the captain could make any reply, &startq;What
an uncon&s;$ionable whore-ma&s;ter the rogue is!
(&s;aid he) &s;carce di&s;charged from confinement,
and &s;weetened with a little fre&s;h air, and yet he
we$ches with a pimp in canonicals in his pay.&endq;
The door again opened, and Emilia broke in
upon them, with &s;uch dignity of mien, and di|vinity
of a&s;pect, as in&s;pired every &s;pectator with
a&s;toni&s;hment and admiration. The lieutenant,
who had not &s;een her &s;ince her charms were
ripened into &s;uch perfection, expre&s;&s;ed his won|der
and approbation in an exclamation of &startq;Add's
zooks! what a glorious galley!&endq; and the mi&s;an|thrope's
vi&s;age was in&s;tantly metamorpho&s;ed into
<PB N="309" REF="315">
the face of a mountain-goat; he licked his lips
in&s;tinctively, &s;nuffed the air, and &s;quinted with
a mo&s;t horrible obliquity of vi&s;ion.</P>
<P>The bride and her &s;i&s;ter being &s;eated, and
Hatchway having renewed his acquaintance with
the former, who recognized him with particular
civility, Peregrine withdrew into another apart|ment
with his friend Crabtree, to whom he im|parted
the de&s;ign of this meeting, which the lat|ter
no &s;ooner under&s;tood, than he attempted to
retreat, without making any other reply than
that of &startq;P&s;haw! rot your matrimony! can't
you put your neck in the noo&s;e, without my be|ing
a witne&s;s of your &s;olly?&endq;</P>
<P>The young gentleman, in order to vanqui&s;h
this aver&s;ion, &s;tepped to the door of the next
room, and begged the favour of &s;peaking with
Emilia, to whom he introduced the te&s;ty old
batchelor, as one of his particular friends, who
de&s;ired to have the honour of giving her away.
The bewitching &s;mile with which &s;he received
his &s;alute, and granted his reque&s;t, at once over|came
the di&s;approbra$ion of the m$&s;anthrope, who
with a relaxation in his countenance which had
never been perceived before that in&s;tant, thank|ed
her in the mo&s;t polite terms for &s;uch an agree|able
mark of di&s;tinction. He accordingly led her
into the dining-room, where the ceremony was
performed without delay; and after the hu&s;band
had a&s;&s;erted his prerogative on her lips, the
whole company &s;aluted her by the name of Mrs.
Pickle.</P>
<P>I &s;hall leave the &s;en&s;ible reader to judge what
pa&s;&s;ed at this juncture, within the bo&s;oms of the
new-married couple: Peregrine's heart was fired
with inexpre&s;&s;ible ardour and impatience; while
<PB N="310" REF="316">
the tran&s;ports of the bride were mingled with a
da&s;h of diffidence and apprehen&s;ion. Gauntl$t
&s;aw it would be too much for both, to bear their
pre&s;ent tantalizing &s;ituation till night, without
&s;ome amu&s;ement to diverge their thoughts; and
therefore propo&s;ed to pa&s;s part of the evening at
the public entertainment in Marybone-gardens,
which were at that time frequented by the be&s;t
company in town. The &s;cheme was reli&s;hed by
the di&s;creet Sophy, who &s;aw the meaning of the
propo&s;al, and the bride &s;ubmitted to the per&s;ua|&s;ion
of her &s;i&s;ter; &s;o that, after tea, two coaches
were called, and Peregrine was forcibly &s;eparated
$word$ his charmer, during the conveyance.</P>
<P>While they &s;tood before the orche&s;tra, li&s;ten|ing
to an Engli&s;h ballad, which was &s;ung in a
very agreeable manner, our hero perceived a
$audry Frenchman leaning again&s;t a po&s;t, and en|tertaining
him&s;elf with a &s;oliloquy upon the bar|barous
want of ta&s;te in England, &s;o con&s;picuous
in the applau&s;e which was given to that mi&s;erable
performance; and as his remarks were not made
without &s;ome in&s;olent reflections upon the na|tion,
he marked him as a proper object for his ri|dicule,
and began to project &s;ome &s;cheme for $word$
him to the mirth of the company, becau&s;e
he looked upon him as &s;ome pert valet de cham|bre,
who a&s;&s;umed the character of a gentleman,
by the night; when he was &s;aved the trouble of
$$venting by an accident which the foreigner of
him&s;elf incurred.</P>
<P>One of the waiters belonging to the place, had
marked with chalk the &s;core of a company whom
he attended, on the very po&s;t which the French|man
had thought proper to occupy: &s;o that,
when he walked away, he carried off the greate&s;t
<PB N="311" REF="317">
part of the reckoning upon his bag and &s;houlders.
The &s;ervant coming to add another bottle to the
account, perceived almo&s;t the whole particulars
of the bill effaced, and began to rai&s;e an hideous
outcry again&s;t the people that &s;tood neare&s;t him:
upon which our hero told him how the misfor|tune
had happened, and pointed out the per&s;on
who bore the impre&s;&s;ion upon his back. This
intelligence was no &s;ooner communicated, than
the waiter, calling &s;ome of his brethren to his a&s;|&s;i&s;tance,
went in pur&s;uit of the delinquent (while
Pickle de&s;ired his company to take notice) and
telling him, that he had carried off part of a rec|koning,
de&s;ired he would return, that they might
compare the marks upon his bag with the frag|ment
which remained upon the po&s;t.</P>
<P>The Frenchman, who did not under&s;tand one
word of the Engli&s;h language, &s;eeing him&s;elf ac|co&s;ted
in a very petulant manner by this attend|ant,
at fir&s;t imagined that he and his companions
came with a de&s;ign to affront him, becau&s;e he
was a foreigner; and therefore thinking it in|cumbent
upon him to &s;upport the dignity of his
nation, began to talk very big in his native
tongue, and, in order to inforce his words, laid
his hand upon his &s;word, in a very menacing
po&s;ture: upon which the confederates flew upon
him, and &s;ecuring both his arms, led him back|ward
through a lane of people, who laughed
heartily at his captivity, which he now believed to
be the effect of an information laid again&s;t him,
for &s;ome tre&s;pa&s;s upon our laws, and, with a
mo&s;t ludicrous expre&s;&s;ion of fear, prote&s;ted, that
he was utterly ignorant and innocent of the
crime for which he was apprehended.</P>
<P><PB N="312" REF="318">
Being conducted to the &s;pot, his back was ap|plied
to the po&s;t, and the &s;eparate parts of the
&s;core matched like two exchequer tallies; by
which means they were able to a&s;certain the rec|koning,
and then di&s;mi&s;s'd the counterpart, who
had &s;tood under their hands, with a mo&s;t rueful
face of expectation, and afforded merriment to a
whole crowd of &s;pectators, a great part of whom
gave him a convoy to the gate, by which he
made his retreat with great expedition.</P>
<P>The new-married couple and their company
having made &s;hift to &s;pend the evening, and
&s;upped on a flight collation in one of the boxes,
Peregrine's patience was almo&s;t quite exhau&s;ted;
and taking Godfrey a&s;ide, he imparted his inten|tion
to withdraw in private from the &s;ea-wit of his
friend Hatchway, who would, otherwi&s;e, retard his
bli&s;s, with un&s;ea&s;onable impediments, which, at
pre&s;ent, he could not po&s;&s;ibly bear. Gauntlet,
who &s;ympathized with his impatience, undertook
to intoxicate the lieutenant with bumpers to the
joy of the bride, and, in the mean time, de&s;ired
Sophy to retire with his &s;i&s;ter, under the au&s;pices
of Cadwallader, who promi&s;ed to &s;quire them
home.</P>
<P>The ladies were accordingly conducted to the
coach, and Jack propo&s;ed to the captain, that,
for the &s;ake of the joke, the bridegroom &s;hould
be plied with liquor, in &s;uch a manner as would
effectually di&s;able him from enjoying the fruits of
his good fortune for one night at lea&s;t. Gauntlet
&s;eemed to reli&s;h the &s;cheme, and they prevailed
upon Pickle to accompany them to a certain ta|vern,
on pretence of drinking a farewel gla&s;s to
a &s;ingle life; there the bottle was circulated, till
Hatchway's brain began to &s;uffer innovation, and
<PB N="313" REF="319">
as he had &s;ecured our hero's hat and &s;word, he
f$lt no apprehen&s;ion of an elopement, which,
however, was effected; and the youth ha&s;tened
on the wings of love to the arms of his enchant|ing
bride. He found Crabtree in a parlour, wait|ing
for his return, and di&s;po&s;ed to entertain him
with a lecture upon temperance; to which he paid
very little attention, but ringing for Emilia's
maid, de&s;ired to know if her mi&s;tre&s;s was a-bed.
Being an&s;wered in the affirmative, he &s;ent her up
&s;tairs to announce his arrival, undre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to
a loo&s;e gown and &s;lippers, and wi&s;hing the mi|&s;anthrope
good-night, after having de&s;ired to &s;oe
him next day, followed in per&s;on to the delicious
&s;cene, where he found her elegantly di&s;hed out,
the faire&s;t daughter of cha&s;tity and love.</P>
<P>When he approached, &s;he was overwhelmed
with confu&s;ion, and hid her lovely face from his
tran&s;ported view; while Mrs. Gauntlet, &s;eeing his
eyes kindled at the occa&s;ion, ki&s;&s;ed her charming
&s;i&s;ter, who, throwing her &s;nowy arms about her
neck, would have detained her in the room, had
not Peregrine gently di&s;engaged her confidante
from her embrace, and conducted her trembling
to the door; which having bolted and barrica|doed,
he profited by his good fortune, and his
felicity was perfect.</P>
<P>Next day he ro&s;e about noon, and found his
three friends a&s;&s;embled, when he learned that Jack
had fallen in his own &s;nare, and been obliged to
lie in the &s;ame tavern where he fell: a circum|&s;tance
of which he was &s;o much a&s;hamed, that
Peregrine and his wife e&s;caped many jokes, which
he would have certainly cracked, had he not lain
under the predicament of this di&s;grace. In half
an hour after he came down, Mrs. Pickle appear|ed
<PB N="314" REF="320">
with Sophy, blu&s;hing like Aurora or the god|de&s;s
of health, and &s;ending forth emanations of
beauty unparallelled: &s;he was complimented upon
her change of &s;ituation by all pre&s;ent, and by
none more warmly than by old Crabtree, who de|clared
him&s;elf &s;o well &s;atisfied with his friend's
fortune, as to be almo&s;t reconciled to that in&s;titu|tion,
again&s;t which he had declaimed during the
be&s;t part of his life.</P>
<P>An expre&s;s was immediately di&s;patched to Mrs.
Gauntlet, with an account of her daughter's mar|riage;
a town-hou&s;e was hired, and an hand&s;ome
equipage &s;et up, in which the new-married pair
appeared at all public places, to the a&s;toni&s;hment
of our adventurer's fair weather friends, and the
admiration of all the world: for, in point of fi|gure,
&s;uch another couple was not to be found in
the whole united kingdom. Envy de&s;paired, and
detraction was &s;truck dumb, when our hero's new
acce&s;&s;ion of fortune was con&s;igned to the celebra|tion
of public fame: Emilia attracted the notice
of all ob&s;ervers, from the pert templar to the So|vereign
him&s;elf, who was plea&s;ed to be&s;tow enco|miums
upon the excellence of her beauty. Many
per&s;ons of con&s;equence, who had dropped the ac|quaintance
of Peregrine, in the beginning of his
decline, now made open efforts to cultivate his
friend&s;hip anew: but he di&s;couraged all the&s;e ad|vances
with the mo&s;t mortifying di&s;dain; and one
day, when the nobleman, whom he had formerly
