<P>THE REPARATION, A COMEDY.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE Character of LOUISA, in this Play, was evi|dently written with a De&s;ign to offer it to Mrs. SIDDONS; but the Policy of the Theatre not permit|ting it, the Author has only to ob&s;erve, that he thinks him&s;elf extremely fortunate in having been able to meet with &s;o accompli&s;h'd a Sub&s;titute.</P>
<P>The very favourable and flattering Reception this Comedy met with throughout, excepting in one &s;in|gle In&s;tance, has induced the Author to retain the Pa&s;&s;age which was objected to, in the Copy; that the Reader may be convinced, from tracing the Character, what little Ground there is for &s;uppo&s;ing he could have been guilty of any intentional Offence, by introducing Party Allu&s;ions. The whole Part of Sir GREGORY GLOVETOP, as it now &s;tands, was written above four Months ago; and the Court Phra&s;es were adopted only as incidental to the Character. <NOTE PLACE="foot">&rindx; The lines with inverted commas are $span$ t$e repre&s;entation.</NOTE></P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Lovele&s;s, now you are too &s;erious. Is there any violent harm in u&s;ing a little art to give a woman an opportunity of quieting her con&s;cience, and gratifying, without the ceremonies, your inclination as well as her own?</P>

<P>Know then, before my marriage with Lady Su&s;an, I was attach'd&mdash;tenderly attach'd, to the mo&s;t lovely of her &s;ex, the daughter of a gentleman who had &s;erv'd his country with bravery and honour&mdash;but had retir'd on half pay, to a &s;mall neat dwelling near my father's park; where, wholly devoted to the education of his darling child, his only wi&s;h was to train her up in the paths of virtue&mdash;</P>

<P>The vicinity of our abodes gave me frequent opportunities of tracing the &s;en&s;ibility of Julia's mind, <Q>&startq;and winning the affections of her virgin heart.

In vain I tried every argu|ment I cou'd &s;ugge&s;t to tranquillize her mind.&mdash;She treated my profe&s;&s;ions of undimini&s;h'd regard with ap|parent coldne&s;s and di&s;dain; and, together with our infant &s;on, left the hou&s;e where &s;he re&s;ided; eluded every re|&s;earch I cou'd make; and at length, I have every rea&s;on to believe, fell a victim to my treachery and ingratitude.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lady Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be &s;ure, Mi&s;s Penelope Zodiac, geography and tactics are unque&s;tionably the principal &s;upports of a woman's character; though, owing to the unaccountable ignorance of mankind, three parts of our &s;ex get married without any &s;uch perfections.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s Penelope.</SPEAKER>
<P>Get married!&mdash;&s;o much the wor&s;e. If women's minds were properly filled with elaborate re|&s;earches, they would have no vacancy for &s;uch un&s;eemly ideas. Think of the divine charms of philo&s;ophy&mdash;pure ethics&mdash;to wander from pole to pole, and to &s;wim in the milky way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Undoubtedly, Madam, if a lady mu&s;t &s;wim, the milky way is as well as any other; and, to a roving mind, the wandering from pole to pole may be very delightful; but I &s;hould imagine the le&s;s a woman wanders the better.</P>

and then learn what would be becoming in a young woman. A fine example, indeed, thrown away, if I, who have lived in the circle, pre&s;ided at drawing|rooms, bow'd at levees, eat cake and caudle-royal, &s;hould have danc'd, and bow'd, and eat for no purpo&s;e!&mdash;I beg I may hear no more of this uncourtier-like friend|&s;hip you profe&s;s for Loui&s;a.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sure, &s;ir, our long intimacy, her amiable di&s;|po&s;ition, and her hard fortune, together with the manner in which &s;he was obliged to quit our hou&s;e, after having been admitted into it as a re&s;ident, mu&s;t leave a regret upon my mind, which I hope you will allow not quite unju&s;tifiable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Gregory.</SPEAKER>
<P>Quite the rever&s;e, I a&s;&s;ure you; and not a precedent for it in the red book. I allow no friend&s;hip, but of form: when people are out of place, the ceremony is to forget them&mdash;a &s;queeze by the hand&mdash;or a proper nod of the head&mdash;but no more;&mdash;no &s;orrow upon the countenance, except at a court-mourning.&mdash;That was the rule in my time, and I never can forget the lord chamberlain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, my dear papa, was it not rather unkind to compel my unhappy friend to retire from beneath your roof, becau&s;e that odious Lord Hectic would plague her with un&s;ought-for &s;olicitations; and to force her and her little infant to &s;eek a new habitation, for impertinencies which hurt her peace more than they cou'd yours?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Gregory.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hu&s;h, child! Lords have great privi|leges, and, at the old court, carried a dignity which, with a proper dre&s;s, a full-bottom'd periwig, and a &s;hort &s;word, were truly re&s;pectable.&mdash;But, let me tell you, that no per&s;on who has had the honour of dining with the corps diplomatique, can or will brook great coats and dirty boots&mdash;I mean no offenc$ to the peerage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear papa, can you imagine, that a
<PB N="15" REF="19">
mind like Loui&s;a's, &s;o worn with anxiety, can thus ea&s;ily regain its happine&s;s?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Gregory.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, I always thought &s;he was too pen|&s;ive for a well-bred per&s;on. You &s;hould have &s;een me at a birth-night, bowing, and &s;impering, and &s;queezing, and nodding, and handing wine among peers and peere&s;&s;es, laced down to my &s;hoes; &s;tockings rolled up; and periwig in full float; then, I think, you would have taken me for &s;omebody&mdash;every feature curl'd into a &s;mile, and not one look of thought upon my countenance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>But &s;urely, grief was natural to the tender|ne&s;s of a di&s;po&s;ition like Loui&s;a's&mdash;her fortunes were of the humble&s;t kind, and &s;he had probably lo&s;t the hu&s;band of her fonde&s;t affection.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lovele&s;s.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my friend, I am too incorrigible in my repentance to receive any con&s;olation from the follies of others&mdash;nay more, do you know that I am Quixote enough in virtue to wi&s;h that Lord Hectic may be di&s;|appointed in his &s;chemes, and even to feel intere&s;ted that he &s;hould?</P>

<SPEAKER>Lord Hectic.</SPEAKER>
<P>One of the&s;e ladies I have the honour to call &s;i&s;ter, and the other is a virgin aunt of this gen|tleman&mdash;but I really can't an&s;wer for either of their <HI>good|nature.</HI> However, Madam, as you are now in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my friend Lovele&s;s&mdash;who I told you was a good &s;ort of man, only a little formal, I will give up my preten&s;ions, and fairly confe&s;s you are in better hands.&mdash;Ah! that frame mu&s;t remain vacant, I &s;ee. <STAGE>(a&s;ide)</STAGE></P>

<SPEAKER>Lovele&s;s.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, I thank you, and if you will per|mit me to offer you and the&s;e ladies one word of advice, it would be, that, while you de&s;i&s;ted from attempting to give cau&s;e for &s;candal, they &s;hould relinqui&s;h exerci&s;ing it without any cau&s;e at all.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Gregory.</SPEAKER>
<P>And &s;o, child, you have broke through all etiquette, and actually been forward enough to &s;tep out of my hou&s;e with a gentleman, perhaps of no precedence at all, and without a pedigree!&mdash;I &s;hould have been exceed|ingly angry, but I never am vex'd before good company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovele&s;s.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Gregory, Mr. Belcour is my friend, and his rank and fortune will entitle him, I believe, in your

<LG>
<L>FIVE di&s;mal acts con&s;um'd in lamentation,</L>
<L>Our Author marries me for Reparation!</L>
<L>&mdash;Well&mdash;tho' we women are, as grey-beards &s;ay,</L>
<L>In duty bound to love and to obey;</L>
<L>And, tho' be&s;et with cares of brats and &s;trife,</L>
<L><HI>Repent</HI> is &s;till the lot of married life;</L>
<L>With le&s;s di&s;may I meet the awful &s;entence,</L>
<L>Since wedlock puts an end to <HI>my</HI> repentance.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From this bright hour &s;hall gayer &s;cenes ari&s;e,</L>
<L>Such as may charm a female patriot's eyes,</L>
<L>Who&s;e great ambition &s;$ars to nobler plans</L>
<L>Than goat's-beard tippets, or than <HI>Marlbrou$</HI> fans:</L>
<L>Who&s;e ta&s;te the rage for Opera can defy,</L>
<L>And bear to live&mdash;tho' <HI>Pacchierotti</HI> die:</L>
<L>With &s;trange ill-bred indifference can view</L>
<L><HI>VESTRIS</HI> on one leg, or&mdash;<HI>the Dogs</HI> on two.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But as we women are forbid to roam,</L>
<L>And though we will &s;peak la&s;t&mdash;mu&s;t &s;peak at home&mdash;</L>
<L>To &s;pou&s;e I delegate my vocal powers,</L>
<L>He knows my voice&mdash;and hears it at all hours&mdash;</L>
<L>Thus, $$t in hand, and poiz'd upon one leg,</L>
<L><HI>He'll &s;tart with</HI>&mdash;"Mr. Speaker!&mdash;Sir&mdash;I beg</L>
<L>"One word."&mdash;"Oh, hear him! hear him!&mdash;I defy</L>
<L>"The honourable member in my eye."</L>
<L>Then o'er the Indian plains his forces rally,</L>
<L><HI>Rave about</HI> TIPPOO SAIB <HI>and</HI> HEYDER ALLY;</L>
<L>While I, the member's wife, &s;hall bear a &s;hawl</L>
<L>Given by &s;ome ponderous pr$nce of Leadenhall:</L>
<L>Or, up all night, with fre&s;h impatience wait,</L>
<L>To read next noon the Chronicled debate;</L>
<L>Where, in good &s;tyle, and better words convey'd,</L>
<L>Spou&s;e wonders at the &s;peeches he has made,</L>
<L>And, with the borrow'd grace enamour'd grown,</L>
<L>Stares o'er the tropes and figures&mdash;not his own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such is the potent &s;pell that all bewitches&mdash;</L>
<L>"For who would fardels bear,"&mdash;that could make &s;peeches?</L>
<L>"Who brook th' oppre&s;&s;or's wrong&mdash;the proud man's eye,"</L>
<L>When he might ri&s;e again&mdash;with, <HI>I reply?</HI></L>
<L>"Or who would groan beneath life's weary prate,"</L>
<L>Who quietly might &s;leep thro' a debate?</L>
<L>But&mdash;there are charms from oratory flow,</L>
<L>Which tho&s;e who only hear, can never know.</L>
<L>Yet, le&s;t I pre&s;s too long the &s;peaker's art,</L>
<L>Pa&s;s me your vot$ of thanks&mdash;and I depart.</L>
