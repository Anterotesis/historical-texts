<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE The EARL of SALISBURY, LORD CHAMBERLAIN of ENGLAND.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Lord Chamberlain of this kingdom is too intimately connected with the Engli&s;h Drama, and with every thing that relates to the character of the Briti&s;h Stage, to be in|different to &s;o gro&s;s an attack as it has &s;u&s;|tained by the late lawle&s;s attempt to break down the barrier which defends it from the di&s;grace with which it was overwhelmed be|fore the pre&s;ent whole&s;ome laws were framed for its regulation, and for the maintenance of its dignity, and for &s;ecuring the property
<PB N="6" REF="3">
of its conductors. For this rea&s;on, and be|cau&s;e it is univer&s;ally known that your Lord|&s;hip has its true intere&s;ts much at heart, I do my&s;elf the honour to in&s;cribe the fol|lowing pages to your Lord&s;hip. The Legi|&s;lature wi&s;ely fore&s;eeing that particular cir|cum&s;tances might &s;ometimes require a re|laxation of the Laws enacted for general pur|po&s;es, ve&s;ted in the per&s;on of the Lord Cham|berlain, a power of di&s;pen&s;ing therewith, in certain ca&s;es, whenever he &s;hould find it pro|per; and while the high office is honoured by your Lord&s;hip's exerci&s;e of its privileges, there can be no rea&s;on to apprehend an abu&s;e of its con&s;titution. The licentiou&s;ne&s;s with which direct per&s;onal allu&s;ions, literal ex|tracts from letters re&s;pecting a di&s;pute they were them&s;elves concerned in, and the many purpo&s;es of malicious, &s;landerous, and in&s;olent in&s;inuation, which have already been brought forward upon the Boards of the Royalty Theatre, &s;ufficiently prove how little it is an

object with the Authors and Managers of that undertaking to adhere to, or pay the lea&s;t re&s;pect to the great purpo&s;es of the Drama, and to what vile u&s;es a Theatre is likely to be applied which is not regulated by the Laws enacted for its &s;upport and welfare.</P>

<HEAD>A VERY PLAIN STATE of the CASE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE per&s;ons intere&s;ted in the &s;upport and &s;ucce&s;s of the Royalty Theatre, have with infinite addre&s;s endeavoured to turn a&s;ide the attention of the public from the original merits of the undertaking; and well knowing that ground was not very tenable, like able advocates in a cau&s;e where facts bear down the be&s;t evidence they can bring forward, a warm, animated and pathetic appeal, however ill founded, is made to the pa&s;&s;ions of the Jury, with a view to gain that &s;ucce&s;s on the ground of humanity and charity, which a dependence upon the ju&s;tice of their cau&s;e could never obtain them.&mdash;<Q>Hence &startq;Mr. Palmer &s;truggles, as a tender
<PB N="2" REF="6">
hu&s;band and an affectionate parent, to pro|vide for a numerous family, who&s;e entire dependence is upon his hone&s;t exerti|ons;&endq;</Q> hence <Q>&startq;the unparalleled cruel|ty with which he has been &s;ingled out the object of legal oppre&s;&s;ion;&endq;</Q> and hence the public, who are ever forward to relieve dome&s;tic woe, and to become the patrons of injured merit, were expected to have been caught by the device, and to have turned out the decided &s;upporters of the laudable undertaking: but the public, who are &s;ome|times very ea&s;ily to be taken in, &s;aw too plainly the &s;talking hor&s;e they were, in this in&s;tance, de&s;igned to be made of, and therefore, very ungratefully to be &s;ure, di&s;allowed the claim which di&s;appointed folly had thought proper to make upon them.</P>
<P>The project having completely failed, there would be a degree of illiberality in follow|ing the unfortunate, if the general conduct of the bu&s;ine&s;s had not been pro&s;ecuted with a &s;pirit of little low trick and cunning, of in&s;olence, of unprovoked malice, and of direct per&s;onal &s;lander, which calls for expo|&s;ure, and ought not, in ju&s;tice to the greatly injured, to be concealed.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="7">
To inve&s;tigate the affair thoroughly, it may not be ami&s;s to leave the Managers of the Patent Theatres out of the que&s;tion a little, while the original undertaking is made the &s;ubject of enquiry; and I will venture to pronounce, that either the &s;cheme was the mo&s;t extravagantly ab&s;urd, prepo&s;terous, ridiculous &s;peculation that ever was &s;ub|&s;cribed to, or the &s;chemers mere impo&s;tors, in whom the truth is not. If facts do not confirm this, it will go for nothing.</P>
<P>The authors of the &s;cheme, which was declared to have been from the fir&s;t to per|form plays and farces, either did imagine they were legally authori&s;ed to carry it into execution, or they knew they were not.</P>
<P>To fet out with as much good manners as it is po&s;&s;ible to attempt in &s;uch company, I will give (for argument's &s;ake) credit to their own a&s;&s;ertions, and for a moment ad|mit to be true what Mr. Palmer advances in his addre&s;s.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;This Theatre was built under a letter of approbation from the Lord Lieute|nant Governor of the Tower; and being &s;ituated in a Palace and Fortre&s;s, in a
<PB N="4" REF="8">
di&s;trict immediately within his juri&s;dic|tion, his con&s;ent, added to a licence ob|tained from the magi&s;trates, authori&s;ing a place of public entertainment, were deemed legal authority.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>It is needle&s;s, in this place, to quote the Acts, they have been too recently be|fore the Public to make it nece&s;&s;ary; equally &s;o is it to &s;ay any thing about the probability or the improbability of Mr. Palmer and his friends in the concern, being very well ac|quainted with them. A &s;horter way pre|&s;ents it&s;elf, in the words of their own ad|vocate, who &s;ays&mdash;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vid$</HI> a Review of the pre&s;ent Conte&s;t, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> <Q>&startq;He had obtained the con&s;ent of the Magi&s;trates of that di&s;trict, therefore nothing from that quarter was to be expected; and <HI>though he evidently had an Act of Parliament directly in his teeth,</HI> &amp;c.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>His having &s;ecured the con&s;ent of the Magi&s;trates, (who by the bye are the very people who&s;e &s;ub&s;criptions built the hou&s;e) is a mo&s;t unque&s;tionable proof that he knew the <HI>letter of approbation from the Lord Lieu|tenant of the Tower</HI> would not, nor coul$
<PB N="5" REF="9">
not legally authori&s;e &s;uch a place of public entertainment as they had planned; equally notorious is it, that they could not be ig|norant of the in&s;ufficiency of the Magi&s;trates licence for the protection and &s;upport of the &s;cheme; and the common &s;en&s;e which told them both were inadequate, told them like|wi&s;e the one could de$ive no &s;trength what|ever from the other.</P>
<P>A report however has obtained, which is very generally credited, and has not been contradicted, that Lord Cornwallis by no means approved of the undertaking, and linding by the petitions the neighbour|ing pari&s;hes pre&s;ented, praying the &s;cheme might not be &s;uffered to go on, that it was objected to even by tho&s;e who&s;e convenience was the pretence for the undertaking, he ab&s;olutely declared his re&s;olution to oppo&s;e it. This intention of his Lord&s;hip could apply only to the e&s;tabli&s;hing a Theatre, without any con&s;ideration of the particular entertainments meant to be exhibited; for his Lord&s;hip could not be &s;o extremely un|informed as not to know that his official power was inadequate to the authori&s;ing per|formance
<PB N="6" REF="10">
of Plays and Farces. The depar|ture of Lord Cornwallis to his Oriental go|vernment, was highly favourable to the &s;cheme; it opened a fine field for deception and impo&s;ition, and the u&s;e which has been made of his Lord&s;hip's name in the bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;hews the parties were very well di&s;po&s;ed to turn it to account. But whether this be &s;o or not, admit or reject this circum&s;tance re|lative to Lord Cornwallis's &s;entiments and intentions, take it in the mo&s;t favourable point of view for the projectors, and it can|not but appear to have been the mo&s;t extra|vagantly ab&s;urd, the mo&s;t prepo&s;terous, and the mo&s;t ridiculous &s;peculation that ever was &s;ub&s;cribed to. This is under the idea of their imagining that they had authority for what they were about.</P>
<P>But now, to take it the other way, which I believe will, by mo&s;t people of di&s;cern|ment, be thought the right way of judging it, what are we to &s;ay of a &s;et of Ju&s;tices, with an Editor of a news-paper, and an eminent Actor, who in order to give a little colour to a bu&s;ine&s;s that would not very well bear the light, affect to believe what they
<PB N="7" REF="11">
knew to be fal&s;e, in order to e&s;tabli&s;h a claim to the pity of the public, and to induce them to feel, that <HI>though the poor proprietors have been mi&s;taken as to the legality of their plan, it would be devili&s;h hard for them not to be &s;upported, after expending their</HI> ALL <HI>for our amu&s;ement, and therefore we mu&s;t &s;tick by them at all events?</HI> I a&s;k again, whether &s;uch is or is not the conduct of Impo&s;tors? And to &s;hew why I believe that mo&s;t people of di&s;cernment will think this the right light to view it in, I beg to offer a few ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>From the parade of laying the fir&s;t &s;tone, the greate&s;t my&s;tery was maintained as to the nature of the authority that was to warrant the undertaking. To his brother perform|ers, and his mo&s;t intimate friends, Mr. Pal|mer always declined the que&s;tion, by a mo&s;t &s;ignificant hint, that <HI>there were rea&s;ons,</HI> and <HI>you mu&s;t excu&s;e me,</HI> &amp;c. What can &s;peak plainer than this, that they knew they had no authority whatever to ju&s;tify their pro|ceeding? Nay, this &s;ame farcical my&s;tery was kept up till a day or two before the Theatre opened, and Mr. QUICK was given
<PB N="8" REF="12">
to under&s;tand, that their authority was mo&s;t unque&s;tionable, that when it was produced it would utterly defeat the hopes of their opponents, but that <HI>there were rea&s;ons of the greate&s;t magnitude why it could not, mu&s;t not be explained, no not even to him!</HI> De|pending upon this a&s;&s;ertion, QUICK was firm to his engagement with them, nor did he relinqui&s;h it, till he found he had been tricked, duped and impo&s;ed upon from the beginning, and that the boa&s;ted legal autho|rity, like the th$u&s;and pounds indemnifica|tion with which he was al&s;o amu&s;ed, was a mere trick to deceive him, as the whol$ &s;cheme was to deceive the Public. Does i$ then, or does it not appear, that they knew they had no &s;ufficient authority for what the$ were about? If it does, read the paragrap$ I have quoted from Mr. Palmer's addre&s;s and tell me how is their account to be &s;ettle with that Public they have &s;o gro&s;sly in+&s;ulted?</P>
<P>I now a&s;k, can any thing be plainer tha$ that the &s;cheme was to preclude enquir$ and to defy objection, by throwing a veil $ my&s;tery over the authority that was to &s;u$+port
<PB N="9" REF="13">
them, until &s;uch time as the building was fini&s;hed, all the nece&s;&s;ary expences in|curred, and the door keepers ready to take the ca&s;h; <Q>and then, to put the be&s;t face they could upon things, to bully it out, if that was po&s;&s;ible to be done; and if not, to rai&s;e a popular cry in their favour, by applying the mo&s;t opprobrious epithets to whoever &s;hould (even in defence of their own pro|perty) venture to di&s;countenance the &s;cheme, depending for very warm &s;upport upon the effect which the embarkation of their <HI>little all,</HI> and the <HI>&startq;tender hu&s;band, the affectionate "parent, and the numerous offspring&endq;</HI> would have upon the &s;oft corner of John Bull's heart;</Q> but he, hone&s;t &s;oul, having a little head as well as heart, was not to be caught in &s;o very clum&s;y a trap, and &s;o the bubble bur&s;t. This firm however of Palmer and Co. including &s;o numerous a body of opu|lent and <HI>trading</HI> Ju&s;tices, (and if this is not making a trade of their Magi&s;terial power, I don't know what the devil is!) was not to be broken up, even if things &s;o far did fail; no, no. The game was at any rate a very &s;afe one, for in ca&s;e they mi&s;&s;ed of the great
<PB N="10" REF="14">
&s;take for which they played, there were other chances, which made the venture de|&s;irable, as even a Theatre for Burletta's, In|terludes and Pantomimes, in a part of the town &s;o di&s;tant from any other, and where there was &s;o much Gallery company to be drawn in, would pay good intere&s;t for the money, and thus all would be well at the wor&s;t.</P>
<P>So much for the original &s;cheme; and now for that part of its progre&s;s which is related to the attack upon the Managers of the e&s;tabli&s;hed Theatres.</P>
<P>The Adverti&s;ement containing Extracts from the Acts, with Coun&s;el's opinion there|on, was the fir&s;t open declaration of the op|po&s;ition intended to be maintained again&s;$ the &s;cheme. It was unequivocal and de|cided; it was in all re&s;pects proper accord|ing to the object in view. Whether that ad|verti&s;ement was in&s;erted by or under the di|rection of the Magi&s;trates or the Managers has not been explained. For the credit o$ the Commi&s;&s;ion, I &s;hould hope it is th$ former; if the latter, no man in his &s;en&s;e will argue for a moment that he would no$
<PB N="11" REF="15">
have done the &s;ame, had he an exten&s;ive property in either of the e&s;tabli&s;hed Theatres. That is a point not to be contended; but it &s;eems a plurality of opinions are entertained re&s;pecting the propriety of denouncing &s;uch re&s;olution &s;o near the opening of the Theatre. To pur&s;ue this con&s;ideration, the argument requires that we admit the Adverti&s;ement to have come from the Managers. Much has been &s;aid about the want of liberality and fairne&s;s in not declaring their intentions be|fore matters had gone &s;o far; but very little indeed of that much would have been &s;aid, if tho&s;e who made the ob&s;ervation had been acquainted with the cloud of concealment which put it out of every body's power to know, or even to gue&s;s, what Mr. Palmer's real intentions were. <Q>His mo&s;t particular friends were quite in the dark about it. The common que&s;tion wherever the topic was broached was, &startq;Well, what do you think Palmer will do after all?&endq;</Q> <Q>To which the common an&s;wer was, &startq;That I believe nobody knows but him&s;elf!&endq;</Q> <Q>And the as common ob&s;ervations were, &startq;Why he holds out that he &s;hall perform Plays and Farces,
<PB N="12" REF="16">
and that &s;uch and &s;uch performers are engaged for that purpo&s;e; but, that can|not be&mdash;the violation of property in the other Theatres, and the Act of Parlia|ment for the protection of that property&punc; will render it impo&s;&s;ible, unle&s;s he gets an Act in his favour.&endq;</Q> <Q>Well, &s;ays one who knows him, &startq;All I can &s;ay is, that he is very po&s;itive in his manner of &s;peaking of it.&endq;</Q> <Q>&startq;But has he &s;aid what his au|thority is to be?&endq;</Q> <Q>&startq;No, that he keeps to him&s;elf; and, no doubt, for &s;ome very &s;ufficient rea&s;on.&endq;</Q> A general laugh, or a few &s;ignificant hems at the ab&s;urdity of &s;uch holdings out, generally terminated the con|ver&s;ation; and theatrical people will ten to one bear me out in a&s;&s;erting, that where one per&s;on had an idea of Plays being acted at the Royalty Theatre, a hundred &s;couted the opinion as ab&s;urd, improbable, and ridicu|lous to the greate&s;t degree. Under &s;uch circum&s;tances then how could either of the three Managers attempt an interference in a bu&s;ine&s;s every body but the conductors of i$ knew nothing at all about? Even admitting that they &s;u&s;pected it, the mere &s;u&s;picion
<PB N="13" REF="17">
would not warrant their taking any mea&s;ures. As Mr. Palmer thought proper to be &s;o my&s;terious, it would have been imperti|nence in them to have tried to extort infor|mation; and the hard&s;hip he now complains of from their not declaring their &s;entiments &s;ooner, comes with ju&s;t as good a grace as the remon&s;trance of a Smuggler who had been &s;uffered to build his cutter under the very Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e windows, without hav|ing the lea&s;t notice given him of the officers intention to &s;eize his property till the boat was fini&s;hed, the cargo on board, and his little all, with the means for &s;upporting his wife and ri&s;ing progeny &s;towed in her hold. The laws again&s;t &s;muggling, and the laws for protecting Theatrical property, are &s;o thoroughly well known and under&s;tood, as to leave the one character as well as the other without any rea&s;onable plea of hard u&s;age on that ground. The ca&s;es however differ in &s;ome re&s;pects, for it &s;eldom happens I be|lieve, that the officers of the Cu&s;toms go &s;nacks with the &s;mugglers in face of open day, whereas the Ju&s;tices <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The majority of the Ju&s;tices belonging to that divi&s;ion.</NOTE> who rank on the one &s;ide as the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers do on
<PB N="14" REF="18">
the other, are the avowed aiders and abettors of the bu&s;ine&s;s from fir&s;t to la&s;t.</P>
<P>An explanation of the fine&s;&s;e with which the managers were &s;everally tricked into a tacit indifference as to what was going on in the Ea&s;t, will ea&s;ily account for Mr. Col|man's writing the lines &s;o much dwelt upon in Mr. Palmer's benefit prologue, and for the non-interference of the winter managers, though here I &s;hould &s;peak only of tho&s;e be|longing to Drury Lane, Mr. Harris I be|lieve not having opportunities of conver&s;ing with him at all. To Mr. Colman it was &s;eriou&s;ly held out that the plan was to open only in the winter; to the others it was to be a &s;ummer &s;cheme, and &s;o the ball of de|ception was bandied about. The fir&s;t &s;u&s;|picion Mr. Colman had of its being a &s;um|mer &s;cheme, aro&s;e from Mr. Palmer's di&s;|inclination to &s;ign articles for the pre&s;ent &s;ea&s;on; but as things were not ripe enough to ju&s;tify his throwing off the ma&s;k entirely, he covered that with a very good grace by actually executing the agreement, tru&s;ting no doubt, to the penalty's never being en|forced, on account of the illiberality of &s;uch
<PB N="15" REF="19">
a &s;tep on Mr. Colman's part in the eye of the world; be&s;ides, if he did pur&s;ue it to trial, the tale of dome&s;tic woe, and the lo&s;s of the <HI>little all,</HI> would, upon the &s;u&s;cepti|ble hearts of an Engli&s;h jury, operate &s;o as to bring down the damages to a very mode|rate amount. All this is in &s;trict conformity with the original plan.</P>
<P>There is one circum&s;tance in the carrying on of this conte&s;t which mu&s;t not be over|looked, and that is the marked inveteracy with which Mr. Harris is &s;ingled out from the other two managers. The rea&s;on is ob|vious. The engagement at Drury Lane mu&s;t not be given up, a little tenderne&s;s is there|fore not altogether unnece&s;&s;ary there; and as the cards have gone, it will never do to pre|vent the po&s;&s;ibility of a future &s;ummer's re|treat behind the &s;cenes of the Haymarket Theatre, too much violence mu&s;t on the like account be avoided here too; but with the Covent Garden manager there are nei|ther hopes nor fears to be entertained. At him without mercy! make him pay for all! charge, prime, pre&s;ent, fire, and away fly at his head all the little dirty malice, odious
<PB N="16" REF="20">
epithets, unworthy in&s;inuations, fal&s;e &s;ug|ge&s;tions, and downright per&s;onal in&s;ults that words can be made to convey.</P>
<P>There are few &s;ituations in life which does not expo&s;e a man to the making &s;ome enemies, be his general conduct ever &s;o com|mendable; but a prime mini&s;ter is not liable to make more enemies than the manager of a Theatre, and when once he can be brought out and &s;et up as the mark to be peppered away at, egad they all let fly; envious and di&s;appointed authors, ignorant and di&s;carded actors; not a painter that can hold a bru&s;h, or a carpenter that can pull a rope in a pan|tomime, and has been refu&s;ed &s;uch a &s;itua|tion as he conceits him&s;elf qualified for, but what at a moment like this will have his fling at the manager. Fortified with the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible defence, the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having done and de&s;erved well by the pub|lic, and proudly upheld by their unequivo|cal confirmation of his being entitled to that character; to &s;uch a man as Mr. Harris, the&s;e rifle &s;hots are no more than pellets ou$ of a pop-gun, deadened by the invulnerabl$ re&s;i&s;tance of a good name, and a &s;tanding
<PB N="17" REF="21">
with the public not ea&s;ily &s;haken; the &s;hafts of petty malice are incapable of wounding, and di&s;grace only the archer that can ba&s;ely &s;eek gratification in &s;electing &s;uch a victim for his vengeance.</P>
<P>To &s;tand forth the advocate of in&s;ulted character is a duty all good citizens owe to one another; and &s;urely there never was an in&s;tance of &s;uch unprovoked, &s;uch malevo|lent, and &s;uch per&s;ecuting treatment, as in conformity with the abominable plan I have de&s;cribed, has been heaped upon this gen|tleman's &s;houlders. But he is in the hands of the public, a public that knows, that ac|knowledges his claim to their approbation, and are ready to te&s;tify their &s;en&s;e of his in|$$ries. Specious and plau&s;ible was the trick $o point him out as the oppre&s;&s;or, and Mr. Palmer as the oppre&s;&s;ed; but the unqualified violence of the attack &s;oon &s;hewed who was $he per&s;ecutor and who the per&s;ecuted, and the re&s;entment it excited burns &s;trongly in the brea&s;ts of the liberal-minded part of the public, who are not capriciou&s;ly to be &s;way|$d from their experience, or &s;o very ea&s;ily to $$ made the tools of an artful and de&s;igning

party. I advance nothing more than tho&s;e who know him be&s;t will proclaim him to be well de&s;erving of; and I am induced to deal forth &s;o much in his commenda|tion, becau&s;e he, for no rea&s;on whateve$ but that of aiming to protect his own pro+perty in a lawful way, has been treated wit$ in&s;ults that could be merited only by th$ common plunderer of another's property an$ the infamous a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in of another's characte$ Were Mr. Palmer a proprietor of either $Word$ the winter Theatres, would he tamely $Word$ &s;till and &s;uffer &s;o bold an attempt to be pra$+ti&s;ed to his prejudice, without at lea&s;t &s;tri$+ing to oppo&s;e it? Were he to an&s;wer n$ que&s;tion in the negative, would any one b$+lieve him?</P>
<P>But the fact re&s;pecting the oppo&s;ition I find extremely different from what has be$ under&s;tood. It is not the Managers of $Word$ Theatres, but the Magi&s;tracy in the ex$$+ci&s;e of their proper duty, and influenced the interpo&s;ition of the highe&s;t authority the government.

the Public more &s;en&s;ible of it. Had the then Secretary of State pu&s;hed on the County Ju&s;tices, and tho&s;e of We&s;tmin&s;ter, at the commencement of Lord George Gordon's affair, as Lord Sydney has done in a very timely, and a very proper way in this, the laws of the country had not been trod under foot, nor the dreadful con&s;equences have followed which the &s;upinene&s;s of the civil power gave way to at that unhappy period. It is only by an early interference in &s;upport of violated laws that effect can be given to the object in view. Had the Wellclo&s;e-Square &s;cheme been &s;uffered to rear its head, we &s;hould, by degrees, have had &s;imilar ex|cre&s;&s;ences di&s;gracing the Drama in every part of the town; their numbers would have pre|vented their &s;ucce&s;s, and the ruin of all would have been the con&s;equence. That two Theatres in winter, and one in the &s;um|mer, are as many as the town with all the influx of &s;trangers can &s;upport, is verified in Mr. Harris's not even making u&s;e of the dormant Patent he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. The Public know this, and naturally a&s;k, Why then &s;hould an ill-judged &s;cheme be coun|tenanced
<PB N="20" REF="24">
for the ideal benefit of one, when the probability is, that it would bring about the ruin of all?</P>
<P>The indeceny, the incon&s;i&s;tency, and the extreme cruelty of dragging forth Mr. Har|ris before the Public, not merely as the only oppo&s;er of Mr. Palmer's views, but as a premeditated enemy to his &s;ucce&s;s in life, and an active foe to the pro&s;perity of his family, has not only been univer&s;ally repro|bated, but with the general execration &s;uch infamous arts de&s;erve, it has been very &s;uf|ficiently branded by mo&s;t of the writers in the public papers, both favourers and op|po&s;ers of the Royalty Theatre &s;cheme.</P>
<P>Men capable of &s;uch illiberal conduct, and who can be &s;o regardle&s;s of the con&s;equences that &s;eldom fail to follow, are of too de&s;|perate a de&s;cription to he&s;itate about any fur|ther mea&s;ures, however violent or however dangerous, that may afford them the mo&s;t di&s;tant gleam of hope, either to carry their own point, or to oppre&s;s, injure, and di&s;tre&s;s the marked objects of their malice. Much therefore is yet to be expected from them
<PB N="21" REF="25">
Petitions to Parliament, praying for autho|rity to carry their plan into execution will, no doubt, be hawked about for &s;ignature, and pre&s;ented with as many names as the Ea&s;tern part of the town can be &s;uppo&s;ed to lodge. The idea of acquiring popularity them&s;elves, by depriving the other managers of it, will unque&s;tionably be followed up by every art that can be devi&s;ed. Much has already been done, though happily without effect, to &s;tir up in the public a di&s;po&s;ition to mark an attachment to the new theatre by te&s;timonies of their re&s;entment to the ma|nagers of the old; and as the game has been played &s;o as to make all the acrimony that can be excited, centre in its application to Mr. Harris only, (and that for the rea&s;ons I have before de&s;cribed) the evident object is to excite a di&s;turbance at the opening of his theatre, and to work about an injury to his property by the con&s;equence of a riot. With the public on his &s;ide, however, Mr. Harris has nothing of that kind to dread: &s;erious indeed would be the con&s;equences to Mr. Palmer, and to tho&s;e who depend upon him for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, if &s;uch an attempt was
<PB N="22" REF="26">
to be carried into execution; for the bold and unqualified &s;teps he has taken in the face of open day, to bring about &s;uch an event, by various other means as well as by the &s;trong points to that end in his public ad|dre&s;s, would place him in a &s;ituation to ex|perience, in a &s;everer degree than perhaps has ever yet been felt, the force of that ju&s;|tice which an appeal, from an individual &s;o gro&s;sly injured, to the deci&s;ion of an Eng|li&s;h jury, could not fail to draw down upon him.</P>
<P>Such are the circum&s;tances of the extra|ordinary ca&s;e I have undertaken to &s;tate, and agreeable to my undertaking I have &s;tated them plainly. It was high time the veil &s;hould be removed, and the generous pub|lic, who had di&s;cernment enough to pre&s;erve them from being dupes to the &s;cheme, fully informed of its extent. They will decide for them&s;elves; and it is upon the general rectitude and the ju&s;tice of their deci&s;ion, that Mr. Harris is to look up for protection again&s;t the mo&s;t impudent and the mo&s;t un|provoked attack upon character that ever was attempted.</P>

<P><Q>&startq;Mr. Harris thinks it would be an af|front to the often experienced candour of the Public, to offer any thing more in proof, that the in&s;inuation of duplicity on the part of Mr. Harris has no foundation
<PB N="43" REF="47">
whatever, as to the complaint, that no notice was given during the building of the Theatre. It may be a&s;ked, could it be con&s;idered as incumbent on the Paten|tees to lay down the law for Mr. Palmer? In fact, the Acts of Parliament re&s;training the performances of Plays, Interludes, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> were notorious to Mr. Palmer, and all concerned in theatrical repre&s;enta|tions. But Mr. Palmer uniformly, and with the mo&s;t &s;olemn a&s;&s;everations in|&s;i&s;ted, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a complete, though concealed, legal right for theatrical per|formances. Indeed, Mr. Palmer him&s;elf acted incon&s;i&s;tently with his avowal, by actually engaging him&s;elf in the begin|ning of February to Mr. Colman, for his regular performances during the whole of the Sea&s;on at the Haymarket Theatre, though at the &s;ame time, he was by every means engaging others to perform for him in Wellclo&s;e-&s;quare. Still, however, this firm language (of having legal authority) he invariably held until Monday la&s;t, when it appeared to Mr. Quick and others, that he had none. To &s;uch hidden pre|tended
<PB N="44" REF="48">
authority, Mr. Harris could only oppo&s;e his di&s;belief of the fact, and any notice of &s;uch, his opinion, given for|merly in writing to Mr. Palmer, mu&s;t have been ridiculous in the extreme. Mr. Harris is much concerned, to be <HI>compelled</HI> thus to obtrude him&s;elf on the public no|tice, being con&s;cious that the attacks of fal&s;ehood and di&s;appointed malevolence are the mo&s;t completely repelled by per|fect &s;ilence and contempt; and this me|thod, which he conceives to be mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent with the high re&s;pect and duty he owes the <HI>public,</HI> he will mo&s;t determi|nately oppo&s;e to the calumny which he&endq; mu&s;t expect to incur upon this occa&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Mr. Harris has too much regard for the profe&s;&s;ion by which he lives, not to feel with much concern the di&s;tre&s;&s;es that mu&s;t be endured by numbers of the drama's dependants, who have relied on Mr. Pal|mer's a&s;&s;urances for a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for the en&s;uing &s;ummer; he therefore gives this public notice, that if tho&s;e under the above de&s;cription can form &s;uch a company as may be able to give any theatrical per|formance
<PB N="45" REF="49">
that may probably attract the notice of the Public, &s;ufficient to afford them any relief in their pre&s;ent &s;ituation, they are welcome to the free u&s;e of Co|vent Garden, wardrobe, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> for three nights, at any time that may be mo&s;t convenient to them, between the pre&s;ent and the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t next.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>Ibid.</P>
<P>In pre&s;erving the &s;ilence and contempt he promi&s;ed, he has acted with the greate&s;t pro|priety. His offer in behalf of the per|formers Mr. Palmer had engaged could ori|ginate only in a benevolent and good mind; his guarding that offer by &s;aying, that if they could form &s;uch a company as might be able to give a performance likely to attract the notice of the public, &amp;c. was perfectly con|&s;i&s;tent with the re&s;pect he profe&s;&s;es to have for the public, as they could not be invited to an exhibition of mummery, at Covent Gar|den Theatre, without feeling that re&s;ent|ment toward the re&s;pon&s;ible conductor of the entertainments there, which in &s;uch a ca&s;e they would mo&s;t certainly exerci&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="50">
The in&s;olent air of the performers' ad|verti&s;ement in reply, was the very e&s;&s;ence of ignorance, impudence, and ingratitude, and did Mr. Palmer (for &s;uffering &s;o barn-like a compo&s;ition to appear) more injury with the public than he can po&s;&s;ibly conceive. <Q>Some|what of the &s;ame temper and &s;tile is the compo&s;ition &s;igned "JOHN PALMER," and dated &startq;Royalty Theatre, June 22, 1787.&endq;</Q> It however produced one good con&s;equence, and that was the letter which three days after appeared in the Morning Chronicle, under the &s;ignature of WHIT|TINGTON, and which, to &s;hew that I am not above following the example even of my adver&s;ary, where I think he is right, I will, like him, take the liberty of copying.</P>

<HEAD>TO MR. PALMER, <HI>Manager of the Royalty Theatre.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><Q>&startq;YOUR claim to the &s;ympathy of the Public, is &s;omewhat like that of an Houn|flow collector; he, like you, only vio|lates
<PB N="47" REF="51">
the laws of his country, and then, in mitigation of his fault, he pleads the wants of a numerous progeny. You, however, are the greater aggre&s;&s;or. The poor, mi&s;led and vitiated marauder has, perhaps, real poverty to encounter in ex|tenuation of his error; but you, Sir, on the contrary, with an income of upwards of a thou&s;and a-year, to fly in the face of the laws of your country, and then to affect ignorance, is not only the gro&s;&s;e&s;t in&s;ult on the Public, but upon its legal repre|&s;entatives,&endq; the Briti&s;h legi&s;lature.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The property of the three Engli&s;h thea|tres in this metropolis, is deemed to be as well &s;ecured by an expre&s;s &s;tatute, as any chartered right in the kingdom. It is transferable, as all other landed &s;ecu|rities, upon the good faith of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution. Tho&s;e who choo&s;e either to embark their all, or a &s;mall por|tion of their fortunes, in the&s;e three le|galized theatres, do it like &s;tock-holders, or land-holders, from a con&s;cious opi|nion of their &s;tability; and this opinion too is congenial to that true &s;pirit of le|gi&s;lation,
<PB N="48" REF="52">
which is always very wary how it infringes upon private property when it&endq; is fairly purcha&s;ed.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;With equal ju&s;tice, Sir, might you build upon another man's ground, and then in&s;i&s;t, from your ignorance, or your large family, that you ought to be &s;up|ported by public &s;ympathy in your illegal encroachment. Are you in want? Set forth a &s;ub&s;cription, in addition to your large &s;alary and your two yearly benefits. Your merit, like your family, is no doubt con&s;iderable: the town will feel for your embarra&s;&s;ments, and mo&s;t likely &s;ub&s;cribe towards your relief with their accu&s;tomed genero&s;ity. This will be acting like an&endq; hone&s;t though embarra&s;&s;ed citizen.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;But your pre&s;ent conduct is &s;omewhat wor&s;e. By attempting to infringe upon the rights of others, you very much di|mini&s;h your own claims upon the pur&s;e of the public. To real di&s;tre&s;s it is ever open:&mdash;even with fictitious di&s;tre&s;s it is &s;eldom &s;hut. But to the &s;turdy &s;uppli|cant, who is fool-hardy enough to make an arrogant inroad on the laws of his
<PB N="49" REF="53">
country, and afterwards &s;ue for its mercy, if the public pur&s;e be then opened, it mu&s;t proceed from that &s;ort of pity that is ex|cited&endq; by the infant &s;ettlers of South Wales.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;However, Sir, I really feel for your de|lu&s;ion, as it mu&s;t, no doubt, involve you in &s;ome difficulties. But, for the&s;e you &s;tand indebted only to your own injudi|cious friends, and your heated imagina|tion: you are neither injured by the pro|prietors of the theatres, nor by the pub|lic that fill them. An over-laudable and left handed zeal for your own intere&s;t, at the expence of others, has hurried you into your pre&s;ent &s;ituation. Blame no one, Sir, but your own wi&s;e coun&s;ellors, and their mo&s;t learned interpretations of&endq; a clear act of Parliament.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Regain lo&s;t time and fortune, in place of continuing in your managerical fa&s;ci|nation. Dream no longer of wielding by force and inju&s;tice the dramatic &s;ceptre of the Ea&s;t, but return to your duty in the We&s;t, as an agreeable and u&s;eful perform|er,&endq; el&s;e you &s;hall hear more from</Q></P>

<HEAD>"STAGE ENTERTAINMENTS.</HEAD>
<HEAD>"CASE and OPINION.</HEAD>
<P><Q>&startq;BY the 10th of George, it is enacted, that no per&s;on &s;hall, for hire, gain, or reward, act, repre&s;ent, or perform, or cau&s;e to be acted, &amp;c. &amp;c. any interlude, tragedy, comedy, play, farce, or other entertainment of the &s;tage, except under a Patent from the Crown, or a Licence from the Lord Chamberlain, as by &s;aid&endq; act is provided.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;And by 26th Geo. II. c. 36, <HI>any hou&s;e, room, garden, or other place kept for dancing, mu&s;ic, or other entertain|ment of the like kind,&endq;</HI></Q> <Q>without a licence &startq;obtained at the Michaelmas Quarter Se&s;|&s;ions, &s;hall be deemed a di&s;orderly hou&s;e,
<PB N="51" REF="55">
&amp;c. and puni&s;hable as is therein men|tioned.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Are you of opinion, that by a licence under the 26th Geo. II. c. 36. the pub|lic performance of operas, burlettas, pan|tomimes, mu&s;ical farces and entertain|ments of that nature can be &s;upported without rendering the performers liable to the operation of 10th Geo. and 17th&endq; Geo. II.?</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;I am of opinion that no licence, under the 26th Geo. II. c. 36. can authori&s;e the performance of any entertainment of the kind de&s;cribed in the query, and falling within the meaning of 10th Geo. and con&s;equently, that the performers in &s;uch entertainments will be liable to be pro|ceeded again&s;t, under the la&s;t-mentioned &s;tatute, and that of 17th Geo. II.&mdash;I am well aware that the practice has been otherwi&s;e; but I have always thought it&endq; illegal.</Q></P>

For every performance they are all liable, from the Manager and <HI>hone&s;t</HI> Charles Ban|ni&s;ter down to Leoni's little Pupil, to a &s;e|parate information, which will oblige them each to pay a penalty of 50l. for every offence, or to be impri&s;oned in Bridewell, for each offence, three months; and the&s;e informations may be lodged any time within &s;ix months from the day on which each of|fence was committed. The very little le|nity to which Mr. Palmer is entitled by &s;uch a conduct as is explained in the foregoing &s;heets, or the performers by the impudent and ungrateful return they made to Mr. Harris's benevolent offer, need not be dwelt upon, it is &s;ufficient for me to &s;hew how much the managers have it in their power to re&s;ent the in&s;ults that have been heaped upon them, if &s;uch objects could for a moment be thought worth their re&s;entment or further notice. But let the future conduct of the managers, re&s;pecting the&s;e performers and their chief be what it may, it is next to an impo&s;&s;ibility for them to e&s;cape the puni&s;h|ment which the laws pronounce, for, with|out looking to the many Ju&s;tices' runners,
<PB N="53" REF="57">
who&s;e daily bread is purcha&s;ed by their &s;hare of penalty incurred by the unfortunate, whom they inform again&s;t, it is not to be imagined that the numberle&s;s needy wretches about the metropolis, to whom a few pounds is &s;o much an object, will &s;uffer &s;o inviting an opportunity of acquiring them to pa&s;s un|embraced. The ju&s;tices are obliged to take the informations from whoever &s;hall come forward, and to levy the penalties. What then will be the probable &s;ituation of the&s;e poor people whenever the Theatre clo&s;es? What their continual and hourly apprehen|&s;ions while it is open, and while every day augments the load of guilt which is to be expiated only at &s;o &s;evere a rate? Indeed, after the ju&s;tices have been made &s;o much a party in the affair, their characters are at &s;take, nor dare they &s;uffer the law to &s;leep, and therefore, as is &s;aid to a criminal placed for trial at the Bar of the Old Bailey, I con|clude with &s;aying to the unhappy people be|longing to the Royalty Theatre, GOD SEND YOU A GOOD DELIVERANCE! Manager, Actors, Actre&s;&s;es and all.</P>

Here I clo&s;e my very plain &s;tate of the ca&s;e. The public are to determine upon the merits of the cau&s;e. If I have departed from the truth, in any in&s;tance, I &s;hall be contradicted; but &s;o far as I have had to do with facts, there is little fear of that. The hurry in which I have been obliged to &s;tate the ca&s;e, mu&s;t be my apology for want of method, and correctne&s;s. Seeking neither &s;ame or profit, as the writer, my &s;ole ob|ject is to po&s;&s;e&s;s the Public of all the circum&s;tances relating to this extraordi|nary bu&s;ine&s;s.
