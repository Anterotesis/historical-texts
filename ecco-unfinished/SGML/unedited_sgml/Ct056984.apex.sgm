<HEAD>A <HI>Spectators Addre&s;s</HI> TO THE WHIGS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE Pre&s;ent Amu&s;ement of the Town, is wholly occa&s;ion'd by the late Villainous A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inati|on of Mr. <HI>Harley,</HI> by Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Gui&s;card;</HI> nor is it &s;trange that the Allarm of this Action has been &s;o great; the Circum&s;tances of the Criminal, the Manner of it, the Per&s;on A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, the Place, all concur to Amu&s;e us. No Age in the World, no Hi&s;tory gives us an Account of a Precedent to this Story. A Privy Coun&s;ellour in Council, at the very
<PB N="4" REF="3">
Table, with Circum&s;tances rather Bru|tal than Manly, by Surprize, with a Weapon ca&s;ually taken up, without Pro|vocation, without View of E&s;cape, and for ought we can &s;ee, without any pro|po&s;ed End to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Nothing indeed ought to appear &s;trange in the Manner, when a Man of Honour and Birth can &s;toop to be an A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ine, the Vile&s;t and Wor&s;t kind of Murtherer.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome Circum&s;tances how|ever in the Ca&s;e, which &s;eem to call for our Remark; and which re&s;pect not &s;o much the Murtherer, for he Merits nothing and &s;eems to have put him&s;elf below or beyond a Generous Pity, that a Man will often afford an Enemy; all I &s;hall &s;ay of him is, relating to the following Parti|culars, only to Remark, that he was a <HI>French</HI> Man, a Papi&s;t, and a Spy to the <HI>French;</HI> and this I Note, becau&s;e I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to mention it again.</P>
<P>I make no Apology for Directing this Letter to the Whigs, other than this, (1.) That they &s;eem to be a little more Al|larm'd at this Attempt, than their Notion of this Gentleman, ever &s;ince his la&s;$ Advancement, as well as before, gave us rea&s;on to expect. (2.) That they &s;een to be concern'd to have their Characte$ clear'd from the Guilt.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4">
<HI>Gentlemen,</HI> You mu&s;t allow you have not been Famous, generally &s;peaking, for abundance of good Treament in the Ca&s;e of the Gentleman we &s;peak of; many a Stab has been aim'd at his Honour and Reputation; and &s;uch has your Heat been in the Matter, that &s;ometimes it has tran&s;ported you beyond what we call Decency: This makes the more Moderate among you jealous and concern'd, le&s;t the true Odium of this abominable Fact &s;hould lye at your Door, and therefore I &s;ay in the <HI>Second</HI> place, you are con|cern'd to clear your Reputation and your Character, as to the Guilt of the Fact. But Count <HI>Gui&s;card</HI> has done it for you, he has put a &s;hort End to the Enquiry, what &s;ort of People were concern'd in this Murther. Now it remains, &s;ince you are happily clear'd of all Su&s;picion as to the Fact, that you may be in a Friendly Way reminded of your former Mi&s;takes, about Per&s;ons and Things in the Publick Affairs; in which you mu&s;t Pardon your Neighbours, if they think you have been Mi&s;taken, and in which this Horrid Fact, however Villainous in it &s;elf, may have this good Effect, that it may Open your Eyes to your own Intere&s;t, and to the Intere&s;t of your Countrey.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="6" REF="5">
1. Here is an undoubted Te&s;timony; (for the Te&s;timony of an Enemy is allow|ed the mo&s;t Authentic) that this Gentle|man, whether by a &s;teady Zeal, or per|haps more direct Mea&s;ures, is &s;o far from being, as &s;ome of you have Sug|ge&s;ted, a Friend to the <HI>French</HI> Councils, and Intere&s;t, that they E&s;teem him the mo&s;t Dangerous Enemy they have; One whom they would run the greate&s;t Hazards to De&s;troy; and 'tis no Affront to Truth nor to your Wi&s;doms, to &s;ay, that all of you were not always of that Opinion.</P>
<P N="2">2. This Te&s;timony is Undoubted; Murther and A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination can be no Counterfeit. I am loth to reproach &s;ome Gentlemen, in endeavouring to &s;ugge&s;t that the Per&s;on now Wounded in Dete|cting a Traytor, had once before Di&s;co|vered a Trea&s;on of the &s;ame kind, and received all the Reproaches of the Guilt you could throw upon the Traytor him|&s;elf; What Unju&s;t Methods were U&s;ed with the Traytor to bring him to Accu&s;e his Ma&s;ter, either by Fear of Death, or Hope of Life and Reward, is no Secret to the World: and how this Gentleman run the Hazard both of his Life and his Honour on that Account is al&s;o well known. You &s;aw the Man Dye with his
<PB N="7" REF="6">
Ju&s;tification in his Mouth, and yet &s;hall I reproach your Charity in &s;aying, you would not Believe. Heaven has now in the ju&s;t Defence of his Honour and Inno|cence, given another In&s;tance; an In|&s;tance that leaves no room for Su&s;picion, unle&s;s you'll &s;uppo&s;e Mon&s;. <HI>Gui&s;card</HI> had a mind to make a Je&s;t of his own Life, for according to <HI>Hudibras,</HI>
<Q><L>He that Hangs or Beats out's Brains,</L>
<L>The Devil's in him if he Feigns.</L></Q></P>
<P>Heaven gave you Evidence of the Inte|grity of this Honourable Per&s;on, from the Penitent Mouth of a Criminal he had De|tected. The Devil has now given up the Cau&s;e, and having joyn'd a Confe&s;&s;ion to it, no man will ever be able to Open his mouth again&s;t it more; wherefore I &s;hall take no Pains to add any thing to &s;uch a Te&s;timony. But directing my &s;elf to you, Gentlemen, that were before male-contents in this matter, I would per&s;uade you to look a little into Public matters with a more im|partial View than you were u&s;ed to do, &amp; tell us, had the horrid Blow been &s;truck home, and the Murtherer fini&s;hed his De|vili&s;h De&s;ign, what had your Circum&s;tan|ces been, and what had been the Conditi|on of this Peaceable Nation at this time? Who&s;e hands in all probability had we fal|len
<PB N="8" REF="7">
into, and what Confu&s;ions would all things have been in among us, at &s;uch an un&s;ettled &s;ettling Juncture as we are in? How had the Re&s;traint upon the Vio|lence of Mens Tempers on both &s;ides been taken off # and the Ballance which has been held by his Prudence between the Fury of Parties been thrown up? the Na|tion had been given up to the Fiery Spi|rits of a few Men who mu&s;t have Fought it out, the Victors had met with no Check to their Heat, nor the Vanqui&s;h'd any Refuge but De&s;pair&punc;</P>
<P>Then it would have appear'd, that the Safety of this I&s;land lies in a happy Medi|um between all our Extreams, between the Madne&s;s and Extravagancies of the State Lunatics of the Nation; and that this Per&s;on alone, had found out the way to hold the Scale between you; you would then have &s;een, you were not turn'd out to be De&s;troy'd, but to be Pre&s;erv'd from your own Folly, that would have De&s;troy'd you; that the New Mini&s;try were not brought in to be Furies and Tyrants, but to prevent their being any &s;uch thing as Furies &amp; Tyrants among us.</P>
<P>And if you can in your Cooller thoughts reflect a little upon things with Judgments Unbya&s;s'd, &amp; laying a&s;ide the Chagrin and Regret at the late Changes, you may &s;ee

that <HI>His Wi&s;dom</HI> overthrew a Manage|ment, Partial to the highe&s;t Degree; that Haughtily Engro&s;s'd Government it &s;elf, even in the Hands of the very Queen, Be&s;ieg'd the Throne, U&s;ed their Soveraign as a Royal Pri&s;oner, and Her Subject, as Dependent upon Party; <HI>a Management,</HI> that under the Pretence of keeping up Credit, Concealed the Circum&s;tances of the Na|tion from us, till we ran Seven Millions in Debt, and knew nothing of the mat|ter; <HI>a Management,</HI> that pretended to have Money Crowded upon them fa|&s;ter than they wanted it, that fill'd up every Fund, and commanded every Loan, and Glory'd in bringing down Intere&s;t of Money to 5 <HI>per Cent.</HI> at the &s;ame time that the Poor Creditors of the Govern|ment gave 22 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Di&s;compt for Mo|ney on the Governments Bills.</P>
<P><HI>His Wi&s;dom</HI> overthrew <HI>a Management</HI> that made a Prey of the War, and a Pro|perty of the Army; <HI>a Management,</HI> that however&punc; Succe&s;sful in the Field, left us every Year farther from a View of Peace than it found us; <HI>a Management,</HI> that made the Enemy the Stronger for every Lo&s;s, and us the Weaker for every Gain; <HI>a Ma|nagement,</HI> that has twice Lo&s;t <HI>Spain</HI> by Con|quering it, and Ruin'd the Army in <HI>Flan|ders</HI> without a Battel; <HI>a Management,</HI> that
<PB N="10" REF="9">
tended directly to ruin the Confederacy by Encrea&s;ing it; &amp; neither knew what to take by a War, or what to accept by a Peace.</P>
<P><HI>His Prudence</HI> has Cur'd the Su&s;picions &amp; Jealou&s;ies Artfully &s;pread among&s;t the Confederates; and has Satisfied them in the Queen's mea&s;ures; Di&s;appointed tho&s;e that expected &s;eparate Treaties and &s;e|parate Peace would have follow'd our Alterations, and have &s;hew'd the Hero, who we thought would have quitted the Service in Di&s;gu&s;t, that his own Intere&s;t, his Countries Advantage &amp; his Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es Glory, might &s;till be in his Power, if he knew how to Practi&s;e what his Duty to them all Call'd for, <HI>(viz.)</HI> to Submit to Rea&s;on and the Commands of his Sove|raign.</P>
<P><HI>His Prudence</HI> has kept Quiet, &amp; brought to Temper the Heats &amp; Pa&s;&s;ions of Par|ties, and not &s;uffer'd the Two Sides of Whig and Tory to meet together in a Storm; but letting them both run on, and &s;pend their Fury in their proper Channels, cau&s;es them to Ebb Gently, &amp; lo&s;e them&s;elves In&s;en&s;ibly in the Great Ocean of Moderation.</P>
<P><HI>His Conduct</HI> Re&s;cues the Church from Danger, Protects the Di&s;&s;enters in their Toleration Liberty, pre&s;erves the &V;nion

from the Infractions of <HI>Jacobites</HI> and the <HI>Pretender;</HI> Quiets the Minds of the Peo|ple in Matters of Religion and the <HI>Han|nover</HI> Succu&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>His Management</HI> re&s;tores Credit, con|firms p$&s;t Funds, rai&s;es New, bani&s;hes the Peoples Jealou&s;ies about the Spunge; rai&s;es Money in &s;pight of Pretences of be|ing Exhau&s;ted; Pays an Immen&s;e Debt, and prevents the Clamours of the People at continued Deficiencies.</P>
<P>This is the Man that has been A&s;&s;a&s;&s;i|nated in the very Di&s;charge of his Duty to the Nation, and in the Vigorous Pur|&s;uit of the Grand Enemy of <HI>Britain.</HI> It remains, to Enquire by Who, and by what Councils &s;uch a Thing could be Concerted?</P>
<P><HI>Church men</HI> could not be Guilty of &s;o Foul a Deed; be&s;ides, A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination is no Church of <HI>England</HI> Practice, He has laid the greate&s;t Obligations imaginable on the Church of <HI>England;</HI> has been the Patron of the Clergy, the Re&s;torer of their Convocation Liberties, the Deli|verer of them from their Fears, and has been the Hand that has given them the A&s;cendant over their Brethren. The Church of <HI>England</HI> men could neither be &s;o Ungenerous, or &s;o Ungrateful.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11">
<HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> could not be Guilty of it; for his being in the Mini&s;try is the Only thing they have left for all the Quiet &amp; Calm they Enjoy. They Owe to him the Protection the Crown affords them; and his Hand alone has kept off the Hands of their Enemies from Violating their Toleration; They mu&s;t therefore be Di&s;tracted if they did it.</P>
<P><HI>Torys</HI> could not do it; for he has &s;hared the Management of the Nation without Di&s;tinction, to Them as well as to other Men; it is by him they are Protected in the Exerci&s;e of that Power they Enjoy; and whenever he plea&s;es to withdraw from them, they can no longer Support them&s;elves; they mu&s;t be wor&s;e than Mad if they did it.</P>
<P><HI>Whigs</HI> could not do it; for he is the only Barrier that Defends them from the Attacks of the High-flyers, who like the <HI>Phili&s;tines,</HI> would be too &s;trong for them&punc; Nor could they Protect them&s;elves from Fines, Forfeitures, Indictments, Impeach|ments, &amp;c. if tho&s;e things had not been Re&s;train'd by his Moderation. The Whigs then mu&s;t be abandon'd of Common Sen&s;e if They did it.</P>
<P>Nothing but <HI>Jacobites, Papi&s;ts</HI> and <HI>French-men,</HI> cou'd rationally come into &s;uch a Piece of Work; and there we find
<PB N="13" REF="12">
it fix'd. A Te&s;timony to the Glory of his Family and Per&s;on, That he has been pur|&s;uing the only fatal Mea&s;ures to overthrow the <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;t; and that as the Par|liament expre&s;s it in their Addre&s;s, It is for his Zeal again&s;t the Enemies of the Go|vernment, that he has incurr'd the Hatred of all the Friends of Popery and Faction.</P>
<P>Let who will be Blind to the Merit of Vertue, its Enemies always bear Witne&s;s for it. The Clamour of Popery, Tyranny &amp; the Pretender, has made a Loud Noi&s;e in the Mouths of a Di&s;contented Party. But this Confutes the Malice of that Sug|ge&s;tion; it is Evident, Popery and French Power, were not &s;o Low before, but they had &s;ome Hopes; but now they &s;ee their Ruin Inevitable: Former Men might mean Well, tho' they mi&s;s'd the Method; but the&s;e appear Right, both in the De|&s;ign and the Means; and this is Te&s;ti|fy'd by Dint of Knife, That if the Life of this One Per&s;on is not &s;ome how or other Cut Off, the Cau&s;e of <HI>France</HI> is Ruin'd, and the Hopes of a Pretender Bla&s;ted for Ever.</P>
<P>What greater Te&s;timony to the Inte|grity of a Mini&s;ter of State, in this Court, can be obtain'd than the Malice and Rage of the Enemy; an Enemy, made De&s;perate by his Keen and Well-poin|ted Pur&s;uit, of the Proper Methods to
<PB N="14" REF="13">
De&s;troy them? What greater Te&s;timony of his Ability, as well as Re&s;olution, to pu&s;h at the Grandeur of the Enemy, than that they Single him out as the M$$k of their Rage; as the only Man that is a Terror to <HI>French</HI> Councils; a Di&s;coverer of <HI>French Spies,</HI> a Waking Centinel to his Country, to give the Alarm again&s;t the Surprize of <HI>French</HI> Treachery, &amp; a Steady Bulwark again&s;t <HI>French</HI> Power.</P>
<P>The&s;e ju&s;t Remarks, may, it is hoped, open Mens Eyes, and remove the Dark|ne&s;s of Prejudices from tho&s;e that could not judge who were, or who were not, the Friends of their Country; and thus the Wound given this Faithful Coun&s;ellor in his Brea&s;t, may be a Healing to the Wound in the Brea&s;t of our Mi&s;taken People; which cau&s;ed them not rightly to Know, or Value, their mo&s;t Faithful Friends.</P>
<P>It is Confe&s;s'd 'tis hard, that Men of Honour, and Steady Principles, mu&s;t run the Ri&s;que of the Fury and Rage of the Enemies of their Country, to Convince that very Country of their Fidelity; &amp; Mr. <HI>Harley</HI> mu&s;t be Stabb'd by a Villainous French Papi&s;t, to convince us, that he is Sincerely applving him&s;elf to, and taking right Mea&s;ures in the pulling down of <HI>French</HI> Tyranny.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="14">
But Wi&s;e and Impartial Men will now open their Eyes, and &s;ee better who are Friends to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation, who Pro|tectors of the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t, who Faithful to their Country &amp; their Queen; Tho&s;e that by Confu&s;ion of Councils re|vive the Hopes of the Enemy; or tho&s;e, who by Steady and Wi&s;e Steps, make them in De&s;pair fly to Villany, Murther and A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination.</P>
