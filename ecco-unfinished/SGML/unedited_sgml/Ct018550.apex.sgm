trailing behind her, &s;tood with her Back to a Rail, ju&s;t by me: Ecod what does me! for nothing in the World but a Joke, as I hope for Mercy, but ties her Locks to the Rail; &s;o when 'twas her Turn to figure out, &s;ou&s;e &s;he flapp'd on her Back; 'twas devili&s;h comical, but they &s;et up &s;uch an Uproar, one whey-fac'd Son of a Bitch, that came to loo&s;e the Woman, turn'd up his No&s;e, and call'd me <HI>B&ecirc;te;</HI> Ecod, I lent him a Lick in his Lanthorn Jaws, that will make him re|member the Spawn of old <HI>Marlborough,</HI> I warrant him: Another came up to &s;econd him, but I let drive at the Mark, made the Soup-Maigre rumble in his Bread-ba&s;ket, and laid him &s;prawling; then in pour'd a Million of them; I was knock'd down in a trice; and what happen'd after I know no more than you.

<P>Sir, I am oblig'd to you for this Declaration, as, to it I owe the entire Subjection of that paternal Weakne&s;s, which has hitherto &s;u&s;pended the Cor|rection your abandon'd Libertini&s;m has long provok'd. You have forgot the Duty you owe a Father, di&s;claim'd my Protection, cancell'd the natural Covenant between us; 'tis Time I now &s;hould give you up to the Guidance of your own guilty Pa&s;&s;ions, and treat you as a Stranger to my Blood for ever.</P>

</SP>

<P>Equally weak as wicked, the Dupe of a raw giddy Girl. But proceed, Sir; you have nothing farther to fear from me; com|pleat your Project, and add her Ruin to your own.</P>

<P>Sir, as to me, you may &s;ay what you plea&s;e; but for the young Woman, &s;he does not de&s;erve it; but now &s;he wanted me to get your Con&s;ent, and told me that &s;he $Word$ never a Penny of Portion into the Bar|g$in.</P>

<P>A &s;tale, obvious Artifice! She knew the Di&s;covery of the Fraud mu&s;t follow clo&s;e on your incon&s;iderate Marriage, and would then plead the Merits of her prior candid Di&s;covery: The Lady, doubtle&s;s Sir, has other Secrets to di&s;clo&s;e; but as her Cun|ning reveal'd the fir&s;t, her Policy will pre|&s;erve the re&s;t.</P>

<SPEAKER>Fath.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! Perhaps a thou&s;and! But I am to blame to call them Secrets; the Cu&s;toms of this gay Country give Sanction, and &s;tamp Merit upon Vice; and Vanity will here proclaim what Mode&s;ty would el&s;e|where blu&s;h to whi&s;per.</P>

<P>You are a Lady; but the Fears of a Father may be permitted to neglect a little your Plan of Politene&s;s: Therefore, to be plain; from your Re&s;idence in this Hou&s;e, from your Connexion with the&s;e People, and from the Scheme which my Pre&s;ence has interrupted, I have Su&s;picions&mdash;of what Nature, ask your&s;elf.</P>

<P>Sir, you have Rea&s;on, Appearances are again&s;t me, I confe&s;s, but when you have heard my melancholy Story, you'll own you have wrong'd me, and learn to pity her whom now you hate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fath.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, you mi&s;employ your Time; there tell your Story, there it will be be|liev'd; I am too knowing in the Wiles of Women, to be &s;often'd by a Syren Tear, or impos'd on by an artful Tale.</P>
</SP>

<P>I don't, Sir, and I &s;hall but little tre&s;pa&s;s on his Patience: when you know, Sir, that I am the Orphan of an honourable and once wealthy Family, whom her Fa|ther,

mi&s;guided by pernicious Politics, brought with him, in her earlie&s;t Infancy, to <HI>France,</HI> that dying here, he bequeath'd me, with the poor remnant of our &s;hatter'd Fortune, to the Direction of this rapacious Pair; I am &s;ure you'll tremble for me.</P>

<P>Go on!</P>

<P>But when you know that plunder'd of the little fortune left me, I was reluctant|ly compell'd to aid this Plot; forced to com|ply under the Penalty of deepe&s;t Want; without one ho&s;pitable Roof to &s;helter me, without one Friend to comfort or relieve me; you mu&s;t, you can't but pity me.</P>
