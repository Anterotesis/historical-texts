<L>FROM the Stagyrite fam'd, as a critic profound,</L>
<L>To the carpers who now in our i&s;land abound,</L>
<L>It has &s;till been allow'd that to write a good play,</L>
<L>Is a ta&s;k &s;omewhat hard, whether &s;olemn or gay.</L>
<L>Such indeed was the ca&s;e when the world was but young,</L>
<L>And from Nature's rough hand bold originals &s;prung;</L>
<L>'Ere the poli&s;h of manners had levell'd each cla&s;s,</L>
<L>And &s;trong featur'd characters mark'd the whole ma&s;s.</L>
<L>Yet a dramati&s;t then, from examples &s;o rife,</L>
<L>Need but ju&s;t look abroad and take copies from life.</L>
<L>But mankind, &s;ince tho&s;e days, have been &s;ketch'd o'er and o'er,</L>
<L>And the Stage can but give what it gave you before.</L>
<L>Nay, one mighty genius, with wonderful art</L>
<L>Pervaded our nature, and ran&s;ack'd the heart;</L>
<L>Hence the works from his hand are &s;o vivid and true,</L>
<L>That Time can but merely retouch what he drew.</L>
<L>After &s;uch a de&s;cription, if Shak&s;peare we name,</L>
<L>'Ti$ but &s;aying what time &s;hall for ever proclaim.</L>
<L>And &s;ince then the Stage has exhau&s;ted our race,</L>
<L>And has &s;hewn each degree thro' the marvellous &s;pace</L>
<L>'Twixt the &s;age and the fop, and the good and the ba&s;e,</L>
<L>A dramati&s;t now can but hold up his gla&s;s,</L>
<L>And &s;imply exhibit the times as they pa&s;s;</L>
<L>Content to pick up, as he &s;aunters along,</L>
<L>Some anomalous beings, that &s;tart from the throng;</L>
<L>And &s;uch, we pre&s;ume, to bring forward to-night:</L>
<L>But our Bard aims at no individual in &s;pite;</L>
<L>He draws from the &s;pecies, and thinks he may &s;ay,</L>
<L>You may find of &s;uch beings a tribe every day.</L>
<PB REF="4">
<L>To prevent di&s;appointment, but not to fore&s;tall,</L>
<L>To one little hint your attention we call;</L>
<L>For this 'tis but right we &s;hould tell of his plan&mdash;</L>
<L>You mu&s;t fancy a female is really a man;</L>
<L>Not merely conceal'd in the manly array,</L>
<L>But a man, <HI>bona fide,</HI> throughout the whole play;</L>
<L>This we own, as it el&s;e might your feelings perplex,</L>
<L>Since &s;he charms you &s;o much in her own proper &s;ex.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now of this dread&mdash;but this merciful court,</L>
<L>A Bard, full of terrors, once more begs &s;upport&mdash;</L>
<L>Ah! kindly adopt the new brat of his brain,</L>
<L>You have often endur'd him,&mdash;endure him again.</L>

<P>I reduced you? &mdash; 'twas your own imprudence that ruined us &mdash; your love of play &mdash; your in&s;atiable pa&s;&s;ion for ca&s;&s;ino, hazard, faro &mdash; that drove us from London.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>SCAT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well! I did copy your example &mdash; I never paid for them: and if you talk of being oeconomical, what married couple ever lived cheaper than we have done? &mdash; The fact is, we never had a &s;hilling: and though each married the other in hopes of making a fortune, you know, when we came to the church, we had n't ca&s;h enough to pay the par&s;on's fees.</P>
