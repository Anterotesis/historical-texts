<HEAD TYPE="sub">By way of Reply, to Sir <HI>H&mdash;M&mdash;h</HI>'s <HI>PEACE at HOME.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Cannot without &s;ome A&s;toni&s;hment ob&s;erve, that a Gentleman of &s;uch Extraordinary Reading, ma&s;ter of &s;o much more than Ordinary Know|ledge, &s;o much an Orator, and &s;o much a State&s;man, as this Author, &s;hould begin a Di&s;cour&s;e of &s;o much Con&s;equence as this, with a Po&s;itive A&s;&s;ertion, for which there can be no manner of Foundation in Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>At lea&s;t the general Practice of all Nations, both Antient and Modern, ever &s;ince there has been Diver&s;ity of Religions in the World, &s;tand directly con|trary to what this Gentleman has advanc'd; and I wi&s;h he had been pleas'd to quote tho&s;e few In&s;tances, which he can find in Story, to make out what he lays down.</P>
<P>All wi&s;e Nations in the World, <HI>&s;ays this Gentleman,</HI> have been convinc'd by Rea&s;on and Experience, and do agree at this Day, and have for many Ages pa&s;t, that there is an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of an E&s;tabli&s;h'd Religion, and a National Church.</P>
<P>This may have &s;ome Truth in it, tho' not without ju&s;t Exceptions, which I avoid; becau&s;e, I would not Di&s;pute with him for &s;mall Matters, <HI>but then he goes on.</HI></P>
<Q><P>And that for the Peace and Welfare of every Government, it is al&s;o Nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve the Admini&s;tration of publick Affairs in the Hands of Per&s;ons of One, and the &s;ame per&s;wation in Matters of Religion, that there may be Unity, and Uniformi|ty in the Church and State.</P></Q>
<P>No Wonder, if from Premi&s;es &s;o ill Grounded, wrong Conclu&s;ions are drawn. If all the Gentlemen in <HI>England</HI> believ'd this to be true, they had the geate&s;t Rea&s;on in the World to Vote for a Bill, not only to prevent Occa&s;ional Conformity of the Di&s;&s;enters, but ab&s;olutely to Fore-clo&s;e from any &s;hare in the publick Admini&s;tration, any one that had but the lea&s;t Taint or Infection of Di&s;&s;enting Principles, that are, or had been Di&s;&s;enters, or were Favourers of them.</P>
<P>What could the Di&s;&s;enters pretend to object again&s;t &s;uch Proceedings, if it were to be proved they were ab&s;olutely Nece&s;&s;ary for the publick Peace, and for the general good of the Con&s;titution; and that it was the Practice of all Na|tions in like Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>No True <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Repre&s;entative could &s;atisfie them&s;elves, or An&s;wer it to their Country, not to &s;ecure them in &s;uch Ca&s;es. It would be unrea&s;onable to Ex|pect, that we &s;hould be made le&s;s Safe than other People, but if two Opini|ons in Matters of Religion be incompatible with the publick Admini&s;tration; if 'tis Nece&s;&s;ary that they, who have the &s;ame Intere&s;t in the State, and the &s;ame Zeal for the Service of their Prince, and the &s;ame Love to their Country,
<PB N="2" REF="3">
mu&s;t have the &s;ame Opinion in Points of Religion, or that the lea&s;t Difference in Religious Matters, tho' in but indifferent Points of Ceremony and Di&s;ci|pline, &s;hould &s;o Marr and Spoil all the other Beauties of their Conduct, that they &s;hould not be fit to be Tru&s;ted or Employed; if the&s;e Things are true, either from the Nature of the thing, or from the general Practice of all Ages; then a Bill of Exclu&s;ion of all Di&s;&s;enters with all our Hearts.</P>
<P>But if upon Examination it &s;hall appear, that this Maxim which &s;tands as the Argument and Fronti&s;piece of the whole Work, be ill Grounded.</P>
<P>If it &s;hall appear that in &s;everal Nations, and tho&s;e &s;ome of the wi&s;e&s;t in the World, the Admini&s;tration of their publick Affairs has been frequently com|mitted to the general Care of all Sorts of the Subjects, and able Mini&s;ters of tho&s;e Nations, have been Employ'd without re&s;pect $word$ $word$ Opinions in Religi|on, and that &s;ome Princes have equally Tru&s;ted and Employ'd People of differing Opinions in Religion, in the mo&s;t Secret and C$$$$cal Parts of Government.</P>
<P>If the&s;e Things appear, the Foundation of this fine Spun Trick of State mu&s;t fall to the Ground, and an An&s;wer to this one Paragraph may very well pa&s;s for a full Reply to the Book, &s;ince if the Doctrine be overthrown, the U&s;es and Application fall of Cour&s;e; as naturally as a Hou&s;e will follow, when the Foundation is undermin'd.</P>
<P>Let us look a little into Hi&s;tory to find out the Truth of Fact, and tho' it would be too Remote to Examine the <HI>Roman</HI> Hi&s;tories; yet 'tis not amils to ob&s;erve, that we find the Chri&s;tians often times tru&s;ted in the Armies, and in the State, e&s;pecially in the Interval of Per&s;ecution, and afterwards in the We&s;tern Empire; we find even <HI>Julian,</HI> the $word$ had &s;everal of his chief Captains in the Army that were Chri&s;tians, and $word$ find &s;everal Martyrs who were Officers of the State, and in the Army, $span$ Legion of Chri&s;tians tru&s;ted with the Arms of the Commonwealth, to $span$ hey not only were Faithful and Valiant Soldiers, but to the $span$ Religion cho&s;e rather to Sacrifice their Lives for their Reilgion&punc; $word$ to defend them&s;elves again&s;t the Government which Employ'd them: And as this Loyalty of principle has not a little been boa&s;ted of by the Advocater of a late abdicated Doctrine, call'd, tho' wrongfully, <HI>P$&s;&s;tive Obedience,</HI> it &s;eems &s;trange to me it $word$ &s;o &s;oon be forgotten.</P>
<P>But to go from the&s;e Ages of the World which afford &s;o great a Variety of Example, that 'tis too much to Tran&s;cribe, and for which I refer to the Hi&s;to|ries of tho&s;e Days, which are very plain in the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Let us come to Examine the more Modern Example of the Chri&s;tian Princes and Nations, and as to their Wi&s;dom, I'll leave that to the Cen&s;ure of Sir <HI>H&mdash;M&mdash;.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Charles</HI> V. Emperor of <HI>Germany,</HI> may be allow'd to be the fir&s;t great Enemy of the Prote&s;tant Religion in <HI>Europe,</HI> he Per&s;ecuted the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>Bohemia</HI> and <HI>Saxony</HI> with the utmo&s;t Severity, and yet both in <HI>Bohemia, Hungaria</HI> and <HI>Tran&s;ilvania</HI> at all times of Peace, the Prote&s;tants were admitted to an equal Share in the Admini&s;tration of Civil Affairs to the Government of Cities, and Command of Armies.</P>
<P>And as in this &s;hort Tract, I cannot pretend to cite Per&s;ons and particulars, I choo&s;e to refer my Reader to the &s;everal Hi&s;tories of the Peace, made be|tween the &s;aid <HI>Charles</HI> V. and his Subjects of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and between <HI>Fer|dinand</HI> King of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and afterwards Emperor, his <HI>Hungarian</HI> Subjects in both which Capitulations he &s;hall find; as I doubt not our learned Author well knows, that the Prote&s;tant Subjects of both tho&s;e Kingdoms obtain'd as a rea&s;onable Conce&s;&s;ion, the Governments of Provinces, their Places in the Councils of State, A&s;&s;emblies of Burghers, and the like.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="4">
To come a little nearer home, the Treaty of <HI>We&s;tphalia</HI> and <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> which are the Settlements on which the whole Liberty of <HI>Germany</HI> depends, the Foun|dation of the Order and Oeconomy of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, and the Confirmation of the Golden Bull, by this Treaty, the Prote&s;tant Princes and States are not only re&s;tored to the Government of them&s;elves, but to their due Intere&s;t in the Mutual Government of the general Body, they have their Seats and Suffrages in the Colleges of Princes, and in the College of Electors; neither Peace nor War can be made without them, they make up the Imperial Diet, join in Councils, and join their Forces. The Grand Councils of the Empire are full of Prote&s;tant State&s;men, and all the Imperial Armies full of Prote&s;tant Officers, nay, &s;ometimes wholly Commanded by Prote&s;tant Generals. For I think 'tis generally ob&s;erv'd in tho&s;e Days, as well as now, that they were always wil|ling we &s;hould fight for them, but not willing we &s;hould get by them.</P>
<P>In &s;everal of the petty Governments and Principalities, where their Gover|nours are Elective, the Con&s;titution is &s;o careful to pre&s;erve this Union of Parties, that the Government is alternate, one Prince mu&s;t be a Roman Catho|lick, and the other a Prote&s;tant, as in the Bi&s;hopricks of <HI>Hildie&s;hiem, O&s;nabruck,</HI> and others; and if the Government it &s;elf is &s;o, I believe I need not &s;earch the Hi&s;tory of tho&s;e Places, to Examine whether their Mini&s;ters, Coun&s;elors and State&s;men are promi&s;cuous or alternate, as the Government.</P>
<P>The late Duke of <HI>Neubourg,</HI> being a <HI>Roman Catholick,</HI> came by Inheritance to the Government of the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> a Country wholly Prote&s;tant; the old Prince being a Man of Temper and Policy, in his Speech to his Council, de|clar'd him&s;elf to this purpo&s;e, That he would make no Innovation in the Reli|gion of the Country, nor make any Difference or Di&s;tinction of any of his Subjects upon the account of their Religion; whoever were Faithful and Loyal to his Government, &s;hould be equally Entituled to his Services and Favour, and this promi&s;e he punctually ob&s;erv'd, to the &s;atisfaction of all his Subjects, and the happine&s;s of his whole Country, and had his Son, the pre&s;ent Elector <HI>Palatine,</HI> thought fit to have maintain'd the &s;ame Ballance and Equality among his Subjects, the Prote&s;tant Princes had not made &s;uch loud complaints of the Infractions of the Treaty of <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Ry&s;wick,</HI> nor have been backward in the pre&s;ent Affairs of the Empire, for want of due &s;atisfaction on tho&s;e Heads.</P>
<P>In <HI>France</HI> we find <HI>Charles</HI> IX. employing promi&s;cuou&s;ly the <HI>Hugonot</HI> Princes of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbonne,</HI> the King of <HI>Navarr,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Conde, Ja&s;per Coligni</HI> made High Admiral, the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> Governor of <HI>Champaign, Mr. Le De&s;guires</HI> Governor of <HI>Dauphine,</HI> and abundance of <HI>Hugonots</HI> admitted into Places in the Court, in the Parliament, and in the Finances.</P>
<P><HI>Henry</HI> III. committed him&s;elf to the Protection of the King of <HI>Navarr</HI> and the <HI>Hugonots,</HI> from the fatal Con&s;piracies of the Catholick League, join'd the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick Army to the Prote&s;tant, and as he found them both Zealous and Faithful to him, admitted them to all his Councils.</P>
<P>And when afterward that Prince was barbarou&s;ly A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by a <HI>Jacobine</HI> Fryer, the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick Princes and Army join'd &s;incerely with the Pro|te&s;tant, and &s;erv'd the <HI>Great Henry</HI> IV. tho' a Prote&s;tant again&s;t the Army of the League, tho' of their own Religion.</P>
<P>Afterwards when <HI>Henry</HI> IV. turn'd <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick he maintain'd the &s;ame Communication of Favours to all Parties, and from the Peace at <HI>Vervins,</HI> which put a final end to that War, and fini&s;h'd the Catholick League, to the Year 1682, When the pre&s;ent <HI>French</HI> King aboli&s;h'd the Edict of <HI>Nants,</HI> the Prote&s;tants were univer&s;ally admitted into Governments, Places, Preferments and Employ|ments, even from the Pre&s;ence and Bed-Chambers of the Prince, thro' all the
<PB N="4" REF="5">
nice&s;t and mo&s;t dangerous parts of the State, as the Parliament, Finances, Court, Armies and Fleets. Among the&s;e Men we find the Mar&s;hal <HI>De Biron,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Saxe Weymar,</HI> Mon&s;ieur <HI>Di Guebirant, Le Mare&s;chal de Marrillac,</HI> Mon&s;ieur <HI>Fouquett,</HI> the great <HI>Turenne,</HI> Mon&s;ieur <HI>du Que&s;ne,</HI> and Count <HI>de Schom|berg,</HI> with innumerable others, who were not only Employ'd, but were really the Pillars of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbonne,</HI> and the Rai&s;ers of the <HI>French</HI> Power, to a great part of its pre&s;ent Greatne&s;s. Nor indeed can I &s;uffer this part of the Matter without a Remark, that this &s;eems to be the only In&s;tance of a Nation that has &s;uppre&s;t one Party, for E&s;tabli&s;hing another, on the bare Pretences of Religion.</P>
<P>During all the time the&s;e Prote&s;tant Princes and Gentlemen were in Employ|ment under the Kings of <HI>France,</HI> the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Religion was the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church, and the Government was all in their Hands; neither were the <HI>Hugonots</HI> under any legal E&s;tabli&s;hment other than the Edict of <HI>Nants,</HI> all their Pow|er was broke at the Siege and taking of <HI>Rochell,</HI> and they where wholly in the Hands of their Enemies, and yet the King of <HI>France</HI> all along thought fit to employ them both in the Civil and Millitary Matters, till the the pre&s;ent King of <HI>France</HI> began to turn them out of all Publick Employments, in order to ex|tirpate them wholly from the Nation, as he has now effectually brought to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>If a like Extirpation of the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England</HI> is the real de&s;ign, the re|moving them from all the Priviledges and Advantages of their Native Country is the very be&s;t &s;tep they can take to it: Nor is this the lea&s;t rea&s;on to make us believe that is in the De&s;ign, for to what purpo&s;e el&s;e &s;hould this Gentleman bring &s;o &s;candalous an Example on the Stage, I can find but one of the&s;e two Rea&s;ons po&s;&s;ible to be given for it. 1. Either that as the <HI>French</HI> King began the Extirpating of the Prote&s;tants by fir&s;t di&s;mi&s;&s;ing them of all publick Em|ployments, &s;o he would have it to be here. Or, 2. that in all his Reading he could not find one Example in Hi&s;tory that would &s;uit the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, and I think I may fairly challenge him to &s;hew me any Nation in the World, that e|ver &s;o far &s;uppre&s;s'd a part of their own Subjects as to deprive them of the Fa|vour of their Prince and the Tru&s;t of Government, but with a de&s;ign of either to per&s;ecute or totally expel thnm.</P>
<P>If this Learned Gentleman can think to convince us that thus to humble the Di&s;&s;enters by a Law, and to offer them the re&s;traint he propo&s;es is the way to Peace at Home, he cannot at the &s;ame time but &s;uppo&s;e that the Di&s;&s;enters are very blind Ignorant People.</P>
<P>Nor can he &s;uppo&s;e that this will tend to the Peace which Her Maje&s;ty has propo&s;ed to us, <HI>Peace join'd with Union, the French</HI> King has brought about the De&s;truction of the Prote&s;tants in <HI>France</HI> with a full Peace, but not with Union. 'Tis <HI>Union</HI> is the matter which as it is the E&s;&s;ence of Peace, &s;o 'tis the only thing can make this Nation happy, and I would be glad to &s;ee how the lea&s;t Pro&s;pect of an Union of Parties can be &s;een in the Scheme he hath drawn.</P>
<P>Let us next examine the Government of Our Neighbours the <HI>Dutch,</HI> where, if I mi&s;take not, the <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> are the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church, yet have they no Te&s;t or Di&s;abling Laws; but as the Government, is Prote&s;tant the Roman Catholicks have their freedom; not by a limited, re&s;train'd, precarious Tolleration, but by Native Light, and a Claim of Title, the States approve, and Confirm the Provincial and the Mi&s;&s;ions of the Pope, and the Roman Catholicks, enjoy the Liberties and Privileges of other Subjects, and &s;erve in their Armies and Fleets with promi&s;cuous and unexceptioned Liberty.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="6">
I know no other Nation where the Roman Catholicks are Ma&s;ters, and that ever had any other Religion among them, but what &s;till accepts the Services of their Subjects of what&s;oever Religions. In <HI>Spain, Italy,</HI> and <HI>Portugal,</HI> the Inqui&s;ition has effectually Damn'd all Religions but their Own, and in this Ca&s;e they are &s;till but Examples of what &s;ome People are wil|ling &s;hould come to pa&s;s here. But if we go back, even among the <HI>Spani|ards</HI> them&s;elves, in the Days of <HI>Philip</HI> the Second of <HI>Spain,</HI> the Nobility and Gentry of the 17 Provinces, had many of them Embrac'd the Prote&s;tant Religion, and yet were continued in great Employments in the State, as the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> Count <HI>Horn,</HI> Count <HI>Egmont,</HI> and Multitudes of others: And 'tis Ob&s;ervable, that the Breach afterwards did not begin upon account of Di&s;mi&s;&s;ing them their Employments, but upon a De&s;ign of rooting out the very Name of a Prote&s;tant from the Country, by bringing in the Inqui&s;ition upon tho&s;e Provinces, which together with the Tyranny of the Duke <HI>D'Alva,</HI> was the Occa&s;ion of the final Defection of the Provinces, and the Erecting the pre&s;ent Powerful State of the United Provinces.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the ble&s;&s;ed Examples of latter Ages, when People have been Depriv'd of the Birth-right and Priviledges of Subjects, on meer Account of Opinions in Religion. One was a &s;tep to the utter Extirpation of the Party &s;o depriv'd, and the other drove them to all Extremities, and being joyn'd to other Intolerable Oppre&s;&s;ions, caus'd a General Di&s;order, made a va&s;t Cha&s;m in the Government, and made a Civil War of 42 years, which ended in the Univer&s;al Revolt and alienation of the Seven Provinces.</P>
<P>Let us now look back a little to our own Country, and de&s;ire our Brethren of the Church of <HI>England</HI> to remember the Time when they were Di&s;&s;enters them&s;elves, when they were obnoxious to, and &s;eparated from the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church, they were not treated in this manner, no not by the Papi&s;ts them|&s;elves; in the days of King <HI>Henry</HI> the 8th. the Lord <HI>Cromwel,</HI> Queen <HI>Ann,</HI> and abundance of the Nobility and Gentry were Prote&s;tants and <HI>Lol|lards,</HI> and yet continued in publick Tru&s;t, and in the Services of their King and Country.</P>
<P>And had not in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Reign, the many re&s;tle&s;s De&s;igns of <HI>Spain</HI> appear'd &s;o bu&s;ie, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Catholicks been &s;o weak to Embroil them&s;elves with the State, and again&s;t her Per&s;on, they had continued in Employments and Places to the la&s;t; and 'twas Rea&s;on of State, and not of Religion, which oblig'd her to treat them &s;o roughly.</P>
<P>Thus I think I have taken a &s;hort view of Hi&s;tory, with Relation to this Gentleman's advanc'd Maxim, That all wi&s;e Nations have <HI>thought it nece&s;&s;ary, to pre&s;erve the Admini&s;tration of Publick Affairs in the hands of Per&s;ons of one and the &s;ame Per&s;wa&s;ion in matters of Religion:</HI> which I think is fairly Con|futed; if he thinks not, on a more narow &s;earch, I &s;hall be content to give him many more particulars of the&s;e things, the Places where, Time when done, and the Authors where the Accounts are to be found.</P>
<P><HI>Strada,</HI> complaining of the Unrea&s;onablene&s;s of the Di&s;contents of the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> tells us, they had nothing to Complain of, for that tho' they were Hereticks, they were admitted to the Favour of their Soveraign, equal|ly with the Catholicks; and were Employ'd by him in the greate&s;t Po&s;ts of Tru&s;t and Honour.</P>
<P>From what part of the World now will this Learned Author pick out his Wi&s;e Nations, who <HI>thought it nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve the Admini&s;tration of Publick Affairs, in the Hands of Per&s;ons of One and the &s;ame Per&s;wa&s;ion in mat|ters of Religion?</HI> I &s;hould think the World had been much more Oblig'd to him, if in this Ca&s;e he had been pleas'd to tell us who the&s;e wi&s;e Nati|ons are, and I am per&s;waded 'twill appear when they are found they were
<PB N="6" REF="7">
not the wi&s;er for doing &s;o, and that it never appear'd to be their Intere&s;t to attempt it.</P>
<P><HI>I am led now to his Second A&s;&s;ertion, viz.</HI> Where-ever a National Church hath been E&s;tabli&s;hed by Acts of &V;niformity, as in this Kingdom, the wi&s;$ Legi&s;lators have generally E&s;tabli&s;h'd &s;ome Te&s;t, &amp;c.</P>
<P>It is very hard a Gentleman of this Author's Quality and Learning &s;hould have the Misfortune to lay down but two Fundamentals as the Plat-form of his whole Di&s;cour&s;e, and at the &s;ame time Dedicate them to his Soveraign, and be mi&s;taken in both.</P>
<P>Sure this Gentleman could not Imagine that things &s;o remote from the knowledge of any Hi&s;torian, could do any thing el&s;e than cau&s;e them that had read Books to look back into Hi&s;tory, to find the time when the&s;e Te&s;ts and other Securities were E&s;tabli&s;h'd.</P>
<P>If 'twas Expected that the&s;e things &s;hould be taken upon Tru&s;t, <HI>as Mer|chants pay Bills for the Honour of the Drawer,</HI> I am &s;orry that Gentleman could forget that the&s;e Ages of Faith are at an End, and People are not &s;o willing to believe one another as they u&s;ed to be; and &s;ince there are &s;o ma|ny among us, who are willing to Impo&s;e upon the Credulity of others, People are grown more Incredulous, and no Man of Hone&s;ty now thinks it below him to lay down Proofs of what he &s;ays, nor takes it Unkindly that he is not believ'd upon his <HI>parole,</HI> &s;ince where Demon&s;trations are to be had, 'tis as ea&s;y to give them as to let them alone; and where they are not, no Wi&s;e Man will be po&s;itive.</P>
<P>Indeed there is One way for this Gentleman to bring him&s;elf off in this Ca&s;e, and that is finely couch'd in the manner of his wording the Second General Head of this Argument; whether 'tis Contriv'd on purpo&s;e or no, I will not pretend to Determine: <HI>Where-ever a National Church,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>hath been E&s;tabli&s;h'd by Acts of &V;niformity, as in this Kingdom, the wi&s;e Legi&s;lators have generally E&s;tabli&s;h'd &s;ome Te&s;t,</HI> &amp;c. This may be true, and yet no Te&s;t but ours be E&s;tabli&s;h'd in the World, becau&s;e no National Church in the World hath been E&s;tabli&s;h'd by Acts of Uniformity, as in this Kingdom. If this be the meaning of our Author, he has room to come off indeed, and I am very willing he &s;hould come off thus, for I am fully per&s;waded he can &s;hew us no National Church in the World E&s;tabli&s;h'd by Acts of Uniformity, as in <HI>England,</HI> nor no Te&s;t or exclu&s;ive Conditions, where a R ligion is Tollerated in a Nation, but the Profe&s;&s;ors of it Excluded from all Tru&s;t or Employment in the Country.</P>
<P>In <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> there is an E&s;tabli&s;h'd Uniform Church, but there is no Te&s;t of admi&s;&s;ion; a Man not only mu&s;t be a Papi&s;t, but exactly, nicely, and con&s;tantly adhere to every tittle, as the Prie&s;ts direct; the whole Religi|on of the Country is the Te&s;t, and then 'tis not a Te&s;t of qualification, but of Life, E&s;tate and abiding in the Place: Witne&s;s the carrying the Count <HI>D' onta ini</HI> and his Lady, and &s;everal of his Dome&s;ticks, lately to the Pri|&s;on of the Inqui&s;ition in <HI>Rome,</HI> for only favouring &s;ome Opinions which the Prie&s;ts did not think Catholick.</P>
<P>In <HI>France,</HI> total Conformity to the National E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church is ab&s;o|lutely Requir'd, on pain of Bani&s;hment, Confi&s;cation, and Death. If this be Vouch'd as a proper Te&s;t, <HI>I Commend the Practice to our Author from the Goodne&s;s of the Example;</HI> and 'tis my Opinion he may with as much ea&s;e defend the &s;ending all the Di&s;&s;enters out of the Nation, and Condemn their Mini&s;ters to the Gallows and Gallies, that is <HI>to go to work with them the &s;h$rt-&s;t way</HI> as he may Defend the Ca&s;e he has undertaken, at lea&s;t I am &s;atisfied he may find more Precedents in Hi&s;tory <HI>among the Wi&s;e Nations he &s;peaks of.</HI></P>

to Expect! Con&s;equences are always ju&s;t to their Cau&s;es, wrong Conclu&s;ions mu&s;t follow where wrong Premi&s;es are laid down.</P>
<P>From having fir&s;t Deriv'd the Cau&s;e of this Bill, from the practice of &s;ome wi&s;e <HI>Nations in Nubibus,</HI> not plea&s;ing to tell us who they are, this Gen|tleman de&s;cends to Defend the Letter of the late Law, and advances to the World that it is no breach of the Toleration Act.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of a Reply, I &s;hall here take the freedom to tell him a &s;hort &s;tory. <Q>&startq;&endq;Two Gentlemen of Quality in the French Court, falling out, prepar'd to De|cide their Controver&s;y by the Sword. But Notice having been given of their Intentions, the King of <HI>France,</HI> who has been particularly &s;evere upon his Subjects upon the Point of Duelling, &s;ends to one of the&s;e Gentlemen his repeated Prohibition to fight, a&s;&s;uring him that if he Dar'd to Tran&s;gre&s;s his Command, he would &s;hew him no Mercy; but being again Inform'd, that, on &s;ome fre&s;h In&s;ults from his Adver&s;ary, he had re&s;olv'd to meet him; the King Ordered this Gentleman to be taken up, and to give Security that he would not Engage.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;The other Gentleman had &s;o little Government of him&s;elf, as &s;till to In|&s;ult him, upon which he gave him this An&s;wer, Sir, If you plea&s;e to obtain a Licence for me to Di&s;po&s;e of my E&s;tate to my Family, I'le fight you, tho' I am &s;ure to be hang'd.</Q></P>
<P>The Application of the &s;tory in &s;hort, is thus, 'tis Ea&s;y to advance an Ar|gument under the favour of Power, which he that an&s;wers mu&s;t do it at the hazard of the too Mighty Di&s;plea&s;ure of the State: but I'le make my Author this fair offer.</P>
<P>As to what is doing in the Hou&s;e, I neither know, nor meddle; but if he will plea&s;e to Obtain for me by Authority the Liberty of Speech, in this Particular, I am Content to accept it, upon this Condition, That if I do not prove the Late Bill to be directly contrary both to the Act of Toleration, and of it &s;elf De&s;tructive of Liberty of Con&s;cience, and oppo&s;ite to the Ex|pre&s;s words of the Preamble, which &s;ays, that Per&s;ecution for Con&s;cience is Contrary to the profe&s;&s;ion of the Chri&s;tian Religion, and the Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> That then I may be &s;tigmatiz'd for a Coxcomb, and bani&s;h'd the World as an Incendiary and Common Di&s;turber.</P>
<P>Can any Man pretend to &s;ay, that the Di&s;&s;enters may Enjoy their Liberty of Con&s;cience, if they will be Contented with it? I humbly pre&s;ume to affirm, there is not one Di&s;&s;enter who is not Contented with liberty of Con&s;cience, if there be, the whole Body of Di&s;&s;enters will readily Di&s;own him. And if the Government would put the Di&s;&s;enters to the Tryal any way, but what may infringe their Liberties as <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> men, and their Con&s;ciences as Chri&s;tians, I doubt not but they would pre&s;ently Determine it to the Satisfaction of the World and their Own ju&s;t Vindication.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry to be re&s;trained here from the ju&s;t recriminations which this U|&s;age of the Di&s;&s;enters puts into my Mouth, by which I believe I could ea&s;i|ly lay Open the Secret Drift and De&s;ign of &s;ome Gentlemen in pleading for &s;uch a Bill&mdash;But I cannot refrain making &s;ome Ob&s;ervations of the Manner of their Management.</P>
<P>And to begin with the Gentleman before me, who has put forth all his Power of Eloquence, in which he is known to abound, to gild over the Poy&s;on of his Principle with the &s;hining Article of Peace.</P>
<P>So, Sir, the <HI>French</HI> King enjoys Peace, all his <HI>Hugonot</HI> Subjects being ba|ni&s;hed or oppre&s;s'd, their Mini&s;ters working at the Oar, under the Roman Guardians, &s;purr'd on by the Zealots of the Church.</P>
<P>Is it Peace that you &s;eek, Sir, by Depriving your Brethren of their Birth|right
<PB N="8" REF="9">
And that not becau&s;e they cannot Conform to you, but becau&s;e they can. It may be Peace, Sir, <HI>French</HI> Peace, <HI>but where's the &V;nion?</HI> where's the Conjunction of hearts and hands that are &s;o requi&s;ite, and which her Maje&s;ty pre&s;&s;es &s;o Earne&s;tly in a time of the Nation's Difficulty; and the terrible Succe&s;&s;es of a growing Enemy? Can you &s;uppo&s;e the Di&s;&s;enters to be men of &s;o much &s;elf-Denyal, that they can fir&s;t be thus us'd, and then U|nite with you heart and hand in the Great Work of the publick Defence? If you can, you mu&s;t allow them to be better Chri&s;tians, than you &s;eem to be|lieve of them, and will find it very difficult to make out another Po&s;ition of yours, <HI>that the Government cannot be &s;afe while they are concern'd in it.</HI></P>
<P>And why not &s;afe? Dare you bring your Loyalty to the Te&s;t with Theirs? Have they rebell'd again&s;t Governments, or ruin'd their Governours, any oftner than the Men of the Church? you have been fairly Challeng'd to the Enquiry, and to come to a Ballance about Loyalty, and your own know|ledge tells you, that the Loyalty of both Church-men and Di&s;&s;enters &s;tands upon an Equal foot.</P>
<P>You have as often been told, that the mi&s;s-managements of the Late Reign, of which &s;uch loud Complaints are made, and about which &s;uch pains have been taken, let it lye where it will, cannot lye at the Door of the Di&s;&s;enters; you can name but two known Di&s;&s;enters that were in any Con&s;iderable po&s;t of Tru&s;t in all that Government, and after all the retro&s;pect of Mi&s;s-ma|nagement, and all the Care which has been taken to Ca&s;t the Reproaches of ill Conduct and Unfaithfulne&s;s upon them, they both dyed in the Service of their Country, and left behind them a &s;potle&s;s Character, an unblemi&s;h'd Hone&s;ty, and even their Enemies will allow that two better Officers in their &s;tations the Government never had; and I am far from being a&s;ham'd of their Names, match them if you can, They were <HI>Thomas Papilion,</HI> and <HI>Mordecai Abbot,</HI> one in the Victualling Office, the other in the Exchequer.</P>
<P>I do not find among all the black Roll of the Nation's Thieves, One Di&s;&s;en|ting Thief, I make no que&s;tion but if they were to be found out we &s;hould long &s;ince have heard of them.</P>
<P>We have lent Our Money to the Government, lo&s;t Our Money by the Government, but we have got nothing from the Goverment, but in Common with the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Not, Gentlemen, but that we may have Knaves among us as well as you; but I believe we may make the Church of <HI>England</HI> this fair offer, that if they plea&s;e to make good Our Lo&s;&s;es by their Church Knaves, we are very free to come to an Account, and refund all that can be Charg'd upon Our Di&s;&s;ent|ing Knaves. But till they accept this, let me &s;ay the Frauds and Mi&s;manage|ment of Affairs lyes among ye, Gentlemen, we have had but a very &s;mall &s;hare in them.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, no Betrayers of the Nation's Secrets, no Corre&s;ponders with the Nation's Enemies, no Fal&s;e Endor&s;ers of Exchequer Bills, no Counter|feiters of the Royal&mdash;No Commi&s;&s;ioners without Accounts, No pay-Ma&s;ters without Vouchers, or Trea&s;urers without Ca&s;h, are to be found among us: what then have we done, that you Sir &s;hould Mi&s;repre&s;ent us to the Nation as Enemies to the publick Safety, and urge the Nece&s;&s;ity of this Bill for the publick pre&s;ervarion?</P>
<P>If this is to be brought upon us as a puni&s;hment, where is Our Crime? if Our Crime is as you alledge, we Claim to be heard.</P>
<P>What the Hou&s;e of Commons plea&s;e to do I have nothing to &s;ay to, and am not now Treating with you as a Member of that Hou&s;e. But &s;ince you have rank'd your &s;elf with the Authors, and come among tho&s;e who ap|peal
<PB N="9" REF="10">
to the People, it is, Sir, <HI>in your Scribling Capacity that I am Concern'd with you</HI> and no other.</P>
<P>I wonder that a Man of your Judgment &s;hould put a Title of <HI>Peace at home</HI> upon a Book &s;o contrary to the Title it bears.</P>
<P>You tell us the Di&s;&s;enters, are &s;trugling for Dominion and Power. I tell you no, Sir, They are &s;trugling again&s;t Dominion and Power. As to their De&s;i|ring a Power to De&s;troy the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church, I think 'tis ungratefully offered, &s;ince they &s;o lately gave a Demon&s;tration to all the World, that they cho&s;e the hazard of being De&s;troy'd with the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church, rather than to let the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church be De&s;troy'd, tho' it might have been done without their having any hand in it.</P>
<P>And if you are Ignorant of the Time, I may put you in mind that in K. <HI>James</HI>'s Reign, when Our Liberty was given us <HI>Gratis,</HI> and offer'd to be Con|tinued upon Extraordinary Terms too, nay and 'tis Ea&s;y to prove it was the Intere&s;t of the Court at that time to continue it. The&s;e &s;candalous fellows, Sir, that are not now fit to be tru&s;ted with &s;etting a Drunkard in the Stocks, were &s;ollicited on all hands to Joyn with you in bringing to pa&s;s the Revo|lution, what fine things, what Union, what Temper was then promis'd us? And what more might we have obtain'd, if we had Capitulated for it? but we took you at your words, Condition'd for nothing but a Toleration, cho&s;e to live and dye with you, join'd heart and hand to re-e&s;tabli&s;h this Church of yours which was then at the brink of De&s;truction&mdash;and yet we are the Men who wou'd De&s;troy this E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church.</P>
<P>What innumerable Reproaches have we daily from a Party of Men, who if we had &s;aid the word, had been no Party. But from a man of your Judgment, Sir, of your Learning and your wonderful Piety, this is a mo&s;t &s;trange thing, and I exceedingly admire how you came to forget your &s;elf.</P>
<P>But, Sir, &s;ince you are pleas'd to Embark your Pen in this Cau&s;e, and Un|dertake to prove the Di&s;&s;enters a people who ought to be re&s;trained, of whom it would be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to make Laws to keep them out of the Government, and all branches of the Admini&s;tration. I think you &s;o far Ob|lig'd in honour to accept a fair Invitation, <HI>in which you &s;hall not want &s;ome more able head than mine, either by Pen and Ink, or by Conference,</HI> to make out the&s;e few heads.</P>
<P N="1">1. That a Bill again&s;t Occa&s;ional Conformity is not a Repeal in Part of the Act of Toleration.</P>
<P N="2">2. That there is a Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a Bill for the &s;afety and pre&s;erva|tion of the Church.</P>
<P N="3">3. That the Church is in any Danger of being De&s;troy'd by the Di&s;|&s;enters.</P>
<P N="4">4. That any thing like this has been the practice of Nations abroad, Ex|cept where the De&s;ign has been the Extirpation of the Party.</P>
<P N="5">5. How this can be a Means to that Union which her Maje&s;ty Invites the Nation to.</P>
<P N="6">6. Who are the Queen's be&s;t Subjects, and who mo&s;t pur&s;ue her real Intere&s;t, they who pu&s;h the&s;e Extremities at &s;o Un&s;ea&s;onable a time as this; Or they who labour for Peace and Union, in Obedience to the Command of their Soveraign.</P>
<P><HI>I Come now to the Que&s;tions he asks upon the whole Matter, after ha|ving been pleas'd to Satyrize upon the Mi&s;takes, as he plea&s;es to call them, which tho&s;e per&s;ons fell into, who Argued again&s;t the Bill, which I &s;up|po&s;e I may &s;ay without Injury to him is, to be under&s;tood of the Lords ap|pointed to Mannage the Conference on this head, where 'twas alledg'd that</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="11">
the Di&s;&s;enters were not Schi&s;maticks, that Occa&s;ional Conformity was not a New, but an Old Invention that a Difference Ought to be put between Going to a Popi&s;h and a Prote&s;tant Meeting, and the Greatne&s;s of the Penalty exceeding the price of going to Ma&s;s, and the like. <HI>The&s;e are not the Que&s;tions, &s;ays this Gentle|man; but this is the proper Que&s;tion before us, in &s;hort,</HI> Whether it be Con|&s;i&s;tent with the Safety of the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Government either in Church or State, with the Wi&s;dom of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, with the Practice of any wi&s;e Goverment in the World, or with the &s;ure Intent and Meaning of the Te&s;t Act, to admit in|to publick Offices and Employments any per&s;ons who are not &s;incere Members of the National Church.</P>
<P>The&s;e Que&s;tions are as fit as they are ea&s;y to An&s;wer, and therefore I &s;hall Contract my Reply, always promi&s;ing this Gentleman a fuller Explicatory, if not Satisfactory Solution of the&s;e Difficulties on Demand.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t give a General An&s;wer to the fir&s;t Head of Que&s;tions in the affir|mative: I do think it Con&s;i&s;tent with all the&s;e Points, that the Employments and Publick Offices of the Government may be Committed to Men of Ho|ne&s;ty, Integrity and Capacity, what&s;oever their Opinions concerning mat|ters of Religion may be.</P>
<P>Truly, Gentlemen, if the&s;e Publick Employments were to be in the Hands of none but Men of Principles, Men of Con&s;cience and Religion, I &s;hould be in great Pain for &s;ome <HI>Gentlemen in Office,</HI> who are meer Occa&s;ional Conformi&s;ts: Indeed, who never took a Sacrament any where till it be|came Nece&s;&s;ary as a Qualification, and who have &s;o much Hone&s;ty as to own they know little of the Matter, and don't trouble their Heads about it, who are of any Church; and as for Religion in general, have no man|ner of Occa&s;ion for it.</P>
<P>The&s;e Gentlemen are &s;afe, no Clau&s;e in the Bill can touch them; Athei&s;m was never charg'd as an Enemy to the Church and State, 'tis not the Men of no Religion, but the Men of too much Religion we are afraid of.</P>
<P>But to the Que&s;tion, It may be &s;afe to Commit the Tru&s;t of Publick Employments to Men of Different Opinions in Religion.</P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e Men of Differing Opinions may be Hone&s;t, and it cannot be un&s;afe to Tru&s;t an Hone&s;t Man, whatever his Opinions be in Matters of Re|ligion; now if this Gentleman will tell us, that a Di&s;&s;enter cannot be an Hone&s;t Man, then let us tell No&s;es, and &s;ee who have the mo&s;t Knaves the Church or the Di&s;&s;enters.</P>
<P N="2">2. Becau&s;e it has been done without Danger, both here and abroad; and is done to this day among all the wi&s;e Nations he &s;peaks of. Except as before Excepted.</P>
<P>But I own here does lye One Negative again&s;t me, and that is, about its being Incon&s;i&s;tent with the De&s;ign of the Te&s;t and Corporation Acts; and there I acknowledge him to be in the right: but then I mu&s;t add, that tho&s;e Acts them&s;elves lye Crowded with &s;uch ju&s;t Objections of Parties, private Intere&s;ts, and Principles de&s;tructive to the true Intere&s;t of the Prote&s;tant Religion, and the Nation in General, as I am per&s;waded this Gentleman with all his skill is not able to Defend.</P>
<P>If this Bill does more fully An&s;wer the End of the Te&s;t, and Corporation Bill, if any thing in tho&s;e Acts are to be prov'd Unchri&s;tian and Unrea&s;o|nable&punc; 'tis but little for the Reputation of this Ca&s;e, that it tends to fulfil tho&s;e De&s;igns for which they were De&s;ign'd, but fell &s;hort.</P>
<P>To ju&s;tifie the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of this Bill, 'tis alledg'd, That the Church cannot be &s;afe without it. I would be glad to joyn i&s;&s;ue with this Gentle|man upon that Head. As to his canva&s;ing the Rea&s;ons given by the Lords
<PB N="11" REF="12">
la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion, I do not meddle with it, as a thing too long for this Tract; at the &s;ame time a&s;&s;uring him, it is not but that tho&s;e Rea&s;ons are ea&s;ily to be Defended.</P>
<P>But the proper Work before me, is to bring it to this &s;hort Head, the Pains are Extraordinary which are taken to po&s;&s;e&s;s People's Minds, that the Church is in danger from the Di&s;&s;enters, and cannot be &s;ecur'd but by this Bill. And why in &s;uch danger from the Di&s;&s;enters? Our Author owns they are &s;urrounded with Dei&s;ts, Papi&s;ts, Socinians, and Occa&s;ional Conformi&s;ts, and I could add with Athei&s;ts too, and yet all the&s;e, the Papi&s;t excepted, are Occa&s;ional Conformi&s;ts al&s;o, but no Law is requir'd again&s;t them. By his Rule Men of no Religion may be admitted to Conform for a Place, and then Relap&s;e to <HI>Athei&s;ts, Socinians, Arians, Dei&s;ts,</HI> and <HI>Hereticks,</HI> with which the Church of <HI>England</HI> now abounds; all the&s;e, tho' Enemies to the very Being of Reli|gion, may come to the Communion for a place, Occa&s;ionally Conform, and return to their ridiculing all Religion, bantering the Trinity, and bla&s;pheming our Saviour's Divinity, and &s;till by his Rule the Church is in no danger, but the&s;e may be tru&s;ted in highe&s;t Places of the Government with &s;afety. But a Man that in his Opinion di&s;&s;ents in &s;ome Points of Religion, but can con|form in part, tho' he be Con&s;cientious, tho' he be never &s;o Religious, this is a Dangerous Man, and it cannot be &s;afe for the Church to have &s;uch a Man employ'd.</P>
<P>To what a &s;trange pa&s;s will this Gentleman bring the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and what a Scandal will he bring upon the Foundation &s;he &s;tands upon, that &s;he <HI>may be &s;erv'd by Knaves,</HI> but dare not tru&s;t <HI>Hone&s;t Men,</HI> that Men of no Religion are fit enough for her Employments, but Men of Charity and Con&s;cience are not.</P>
<P>If any Man ask me now, whether I am pleading for Occa&s;ional Confor|mity, <HI>I freely An&s;wer no,</HI> nor do I approve of it in it &s;elf, but when made u&s;e of for a mere Qualification, I abhor both the Practices and the Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>But this Law is not at all the more to be ju&s;tified from the Unju&s;tifia|blene&s;s of that practce, becau&s;e this deprives tho&s;e Men of a ju&s;t Liberty, who&s;e Con&s;ciences by the Toleration Act have that very thing allow'd them, which now will be re&s;train'd, and in that matter if in no other is an Infraction of that Act.</P>
<P>The Toleration Bill &s;ays, that the Penalties of certain Laws are taken off from the Di&s;&s;enters, on Accounts of their not Conforming; here are new Penalties putting on, upon &s;ome that can Conform in part, becau&s;e they cannot conform wholly.</P>
<P>But &s;ays this Gentleman, they may then quit the Offices, and then there is no Per&s;ecution. To which I An&s;wer, to be forc'd to do it, is puni&s;hment, and puni&s;hment is Per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>'Tis not the Que&s;tion whether a Di&s;&s;enter can ju&s;tifie his Occa&s;ional Con|formity to his own Con&s;cience, but whether he can ju&s;tifie it to the Law; if he can do the la&s;t, then is the ca&s;e no Crime; and to have a Law made again&s;t that which is no Crime, is what this Gentleman has not yet under|taken to meddle with.</P>
<P>The whole &s;train of this Argument, and which this Gentleman lays a very great &s;tre&s;s on, is, That the Di&s;&s;enters are Enemies to the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church, and therefore <HI>'tis not &s;afe</HI> any part of the Admini&s;tration of Publick affairs &s;hould be in their Hands.</P>
<P>That this is the &s;pecious Pretence, is very plain; but as I have already no|ted, this is a Foundation wrong laid, and can never be prov'd, nor made Out; and if the&s;e Gentlemen would come to a fair Examination of Cir|cum&s;tances, they could not prove that they have any ju&s;t Grounds for it.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="13">
As to principles of Rebellion, and Enmity to Monarchies, and to the <HI>Jus Divinum</HI> of the Crown, how often have the Church been challeng'd to come to a Ballance of Loyalty with the Di&s;&s;enters, nay tho' we were to thro' in all they can &s;ay of the Days of 41 into the Scale.</P>
<P><HI>Even this Gentleman Owns, Fol. 9. what I affirm, they are his own words and de&s;erve remark.</HI> The Be&s;t of the Di&s;&s;enters de&s;ire not Power and Dominion, but Liberty of Con&s;cience and Exemption from penal Laws. <HI>Say you &s;o, Sir, then what Occa&s;ion of the Law, if your next words which are the&s;e are true?</HI> The Irue Members of the Church, De&s;ire no more than to &s;ee the Admini&s;trati|on of publick Affairs in the haxas of &s;uch as are well affected to the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Government.</P>
<P>Now to bring the&s;e two together, tho&s;e Di&s;&s;enters who De&s;ire not Power and Dominion, cannot be Un&s;afe in the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Government; why then &s;hou'd the Church be &s;o eager to &s;hut them out of the Admini&s;tration? This Argument lyes Directly again&s;t him.</P>
<P>As to the Te&s;t Act, I wi&s;h this Gentleman, who &s;o often brings it in as a thing &s;o Sacred, &s;o E&s;&s;ential to the Churches &s;afety, and &s;o needful to be enforc'd, wou'd have been pleas'd to have Undertaken the Defence of the Morality of that Act in its own Nature, and a little Examin'd the Method of pro|curing it, and the De&s;ign of the Reigning Parties of tho&s;e days; let him tell us whether that Act was made meerly to &s;ecure the Church, or whether tho&s;e people who hone&s;tly meant the &s;ecurity of the Church, were not acted by another &s;ecret Party, who only de&s;ign'd to uphold the Divi&s;ion be|tween the Church and the Di&s;&s;enters, in order at la&s;t to De&s;troy both. Let him tell us if he can <HI>from what principle,</HI> or in what Nation but ours, Divine and &s;acred Ordinances are Expos'd as the Te&s;t or Qualification for Secular Intere&s;t, and be made the Hand-maid of Parties, the Badge of a States-Man, and a Mark of Di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>Let him tell us what Unaccountable Prophanation of tho&s;e &s;acred In&s;titu|tions of <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us</HI> have been Occa&s;ion'd by Compelling and Obliging &s;uch to receive the Sacrament, who had no more Religion than a hor&s;e, and who made a je&s;t of the Matter, who&s;e practice amounts only to that of <HI>Ratclifts Souldier.</HI></P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>To be Godly a while, and then <HI>as ye were.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Let him defend the Policy of that Act too if he can. Let him tell me, if Mens hone&s;ty rather than their Opinions of Indifferent things in Re|ligion, is not the more needful point to be examin d as to Employments in the State, for here a Knave &s;hall be employ'd if he will take the Te&s;t, and the more Knave he is, the le&s;s he will Scruple it. But the hone&s;t man &s;hall be &s;hut out, becau&s;e his con&s;cience permits him not to comply.</P>
<P>If the Nature, the Morality, or the Policy of that Act cannot be defended, then all the Arguments drawn from that Act fall to the Ground, and then I think his three great Foundations an&s;wer'd and overthrown.</P>
<P N="1">1. I believe to have prov'd, That wi&s;e Nations in all Ages have thought &s;it to entru&s;t the Admini&s;tration of publick Affairs in the hands of per&s;ons of different Per&s;wa&s;ions in Matters of Religion.</P>

<P>In <HI>Scotland,</HI> where &s;o much out-cry of Per&s;ecution is made, tho' with &s;o little rea&s;on, the National Church is <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> yet almo&s;t all the Offices and Admini&s;tration is in the Hands of the <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> Di&s;&s;enters, without any Te&s;t or other Quallification, than their Oaths of Allegiance to the Queen, and Recognition the Government.</P>
<P>Upon the whole 'tis plain the De&s;ign at lea&s;t of this Author &s;eems to be not to keep Men out of the Government for being Knaves, but for being Di&s;|&s;enters; for by this Law he that will take the Sacrament, and go to a Meet|ing, &s;hall not be fit for a Place of Tru&s;t; but he that will go from the Sacra|ment to a Bawdy-Hou&s;e, remains as well Qualified as before.</P>
<P>A Di&s;&s;enter tho' of never &s;o much Hone&s;ty and Principles &s;hall be made un|capable of the Service of his Country, and rendred &s;u&s;pected to the Govern|ment, while a Man of no Principles at all, that will take a Sacrament in the Morning, be Drunk and Swear at the Prei&s;t that gave it him in the Afternoon, that will Bla&s;pheme God, Banter Religion, Buffoon the Face of the Govern|ment, be as Leud and Irreligious as the Father of Mi&s;chief can make him, is &s;uffred to enjoy all the Advantages of Office, Government and Admini&s;tration, and with-held from nothing that's Wicked, the Scandalous Crime of a Meeting-Hou&s;e only excepted.</P>
<P>There is really &s;omething My&s;terious in this, &s;omething odd and unaccount|able, and unle&s;s the Gentlemen who are for this Bill can give &s;ome better Rea|&s;ons for it than Sir <HI>Humphery</HI> has thought fit to make Publick, I &s;ee nothing yet advanc'd but what is &s;o ea&s;y to be An&s;wer'd, that I wonder to &s;ee him of|fer things &s;o Ab&s;urd.</P>
<P><HI>His being &s;en&s;ible of this I am per&s;waded was the Birth of his Po&s;t-&s;cript, in which he tells us, That</HI> he does not from thence conclude, that &s;o Wi&s;e and &s;o Great an A&s;&s;embly are not able to Amend their own Bill, and to order it &s;o as the pa&s;&s;ing &s;uch a Bill may neither be a Snare to the Church-man, nor &agrave; Prejudice to the Di&s;&s;enters, &s;uch a Bill as will not De&s;troy but Pre&s;erve our Religion, Laws and Liberties, and evermore E&s;tabli&s;h Peace and Unity among&s;t us, and &s;ettle our Con|&s;titution upon a &s;ure and la&s;ting Foundation.</P>
<P>This is fine Language, and like Sir <HI>Humphery,</HI> who all Men know is Ma&s;ter of good Words, Sounds well in the Mouth. But let us examine a little the Signification of this, and certainly never were &s;o many Words put together to le&s;s purpo&s;e as to the Argument in Hand; Nay, &s;o unhappily is this Po&s;t-&s;cript brought in at the Clo&s;e, that 'tis as it were a &s;aying the whole Book back|ward like a Witches Prayers, 'tis unravelling all the Thread of the former Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>If the Parliament can make &s;uch Amendments to their Bill as &s;hall make it <HI>no Snare to the Church-man,</HI> nor <HI>Prejudice to the Di&s;&s;enter,</HI> why, then it &s;eems plain that till 'tis amended it is even in this Gentleman's Opinion, both <HI>a Snare to one,</HI> and <HI>a Prejudice to the other.</HI> If they can make it &s;uch a Bill as will <HI>not De&s;troy, but Pre&s;erve our Religion, Laws and Liberties,</HI> it &s;hould &s;eem by Sir <HI>Humphery</HI>'s own Words, that as yet 'tis a thing that <HI>will de&s;troy them all.</HI> If the Com|mons by amending this Bill may bring it to be <HI>a means of E&s;tabli&s;hing Peace and Union among us,</HI> 'tis a Natural Inference to &s;ay, that without &s;uch Amendments it <HI>will not E&s;tabli&s;h Peace and Unity among us.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="15">
I will not pretend to di&s;pute the Power of the Hou&s;e of Commons, to alter or amend any of their own Bills, 'tis without Que&s;tion their Native Right; but whether they can &s;o amend their Bill, as to bring it to be no Snare to the Church, no Prejudice to the Di&s;&s;enters, a Pre&s;ervation to our Religion, Laws and Liberties, and an E&s;tabli&s;hment of Peace and Union among us. I will not determine, but I am per&s;waded whenever 'tis &s;o amended, as to be capable of all tho&s;e good Ends, no Di&s;&s;enter in the Nation will be unwilling it &s;hould pa&s;s; and till it is, no hone&s;t Man can wi&s;h it &s;hould.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>I Cannot di&s;mi&s;s this Di&s;cour&s;e without putting my Author in Mind of the Infant State of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Church, in the Days of <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, the&s;e were the Churches Days of &s;uffering, which mo&s;t People are willing to forget, <HI>The&s;e Par&s;ons forget that ever they were Clerks.</HI> The Hi&s;tory of the Re|formation of <HI>England</HI> would put them in Mind, what Oppo&s;ition they made to the &s;ix Articles, how they complain'd of the ill U&s;age of the Government, and how they them&s;elves were than treated.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, they tell us the King was impo&s;s'd upon, and abu&s;ed by the Bi&s;hops, and other wicked Coun&s;ellors, to form the &s;ix Articles to de&s;troy the growth of the Reformation, and it may be worth while to ob&s;erve in what Terms they were repre&s;ented to the King.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop of <HI>Winche&s;ter</HI> in particular, fir&s;t took care to fill the King's Head with Fears of Civil Tumults and Commotions, a thing it &s;eems the King was naturally very unea&s;y about, having, as he thought, made the People very much our of Temper by his di&s;&s;olving the Religious Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>Popery was now the E&s;tabli&s;h'd National Church, but the Nation was full of Di&s;|&s;enters, <HI>that is Prote&s;tants;</HI> &s;uch as now are call'd <HI>of the Church of</HI> England, the Mem|bers of the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church believing, or at lea&s;t pretending that they were not &s;afe, nor could not be &s;ecur'd, till more Laws were made for the Security of the Church, put the King upon the&s;e &s;ix Bloody Articles. The very Words which are Recorded of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Winche&s;ter</HI> in this Ca&s;e, are the very &s;ame made U&s;e of by the pre&s;ent Gentleman again&s;t the Di&s;&s;enters, <HI>viz. He be&s;ought the King for his own Safe-guard, and the Safety, Quiet and Tranquility of the Kingdom, to be Careful, Sharp and Severe again&s;t the Sectaries and Sacramentaries,</HI> Acts a Mon. <HI>Vol.</HI> 2. <HI>Fol.</HI> 441. I would only de&s;ire this Gentleman to reflect a little, who the&s;e <HI>Sectaries</HI> and <HI>Sacramentaries</HI> were?&mdash;Truly no body, but your own <HI>dear Loyal Church,</HI> who are ju&s;t Treating &s;ome People with the very &s;ame Terms, and Names of Di&s;tinction, which they in Contempt were treated with by their Enemies, the Papi&s;ts. All the U&s;e I &s;hall make of it is to tell them it is a little Unkind; 'tis not according to the Golden Rule of <HI>doing as they would be done by&punc;</HI> 'Tis nor a very honourable way of Proceeding, to cry out of the hard&s;hip of that U&s;age when impo&s;ed upon them, and make Apologies for the Moderation of it, when you want to impo&s;e it upon others.</P>
<P>When the&s;e &s;ix Articles were in Agitation in the Hou&s;e of Lords, Archbi&s;hop <HI>Cran|mer</HI> was the only Man, who had the Courage to with&s;tand the Current of the Times, which he did with &s;o much earne&s;t Zeal, that the King commanded him to go out of the Hou&s;e, which yet he Mode&s;tly refu&s;ed to do, pleading, tho' in a very humble manner his Privilege, and continued, tho' in vain to oppo&s;e it; and had certainly overthrown the Articles, &s;ays the Author afore&s;aid, <HI>Ni&s;i Pars Major Vici&s;&s;et ut &s;epe $word$ Melicrem,</HI> Fox. Act. Mon. <HI>Vol.</HI> 2. <HI>Fol.</HI> 443.</P>
<P>This was the proceeding again&s;t Sectarian Schi&s;matical Church of <HI>England,</HI> Di&s;&s;en|ters of tho&s;e Days; I leave the Gentlemen of the Church to reflect a little, whether now they come to be the E&s;tabli&s;h'd National Church, they Treat the Di&s;&s;enters under them, as they would be Treated; whether we have not the &s;ame Cau&s;e to think our &s;$lves ill Treated, as they had in tho&s;e Times; and whether indeed the Ca&s;e is not harder with us, than it was with them, for that our Difference is about indifferent Things, theirs about E&s;&s;ential Catholick Points.</P>
<P>This Story &s;erves not to reflect upon the Church, but to de&s;ire &s;ome Gentlemen of the Church to reflect a little upon them&s;elves; how they were u&s;ed, when they were counted the Schi&s;maticks and Sectaries; and how hard they thought them&s;elves u&s;ed, when Laws were made again&s;t them, on pretence of the Safety and Security of the Na|tional Church.</P>
